[38:03] father to bring encouragement to the
[38:09] prey we ask this in the name of the Lord
[38:12] Jesus Christ and to the glory of God
[38:15] amen
[38:18] I'd like to read from night tonight from
[38:21] Isaiah chapter 54 verse 17
[38:43] no weapon that is formed against these
[38:46] shall prosper and every tongue that
[38:49] shall rise against the in judgment thou
[38:51] shalt condemn this is the heritage of
[38:55] the servants of the Lord and their
[38:57] righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord
[38:59] you may be seated I want to speak on no
[39:07] weapon shall prosper no weapon that is
[39:11] formed against thee
[39:13] it means created any weapon created it
[39:17] also means that there is no ordained
[39:20] weapon that no weapon that is ordained
[39:23] to prosper every weapon that is formed
[39:27] is ordained to fail and it says every
[39:40] tongue that shall rise against the in
[39:41] judgment it means to persist every
[39:45] witness that would persist against the
[39:47] in judgment thou shalt condemn them as
[39:51] being guilty this is the heritage of the
[39:55] servants of the Lord and their
[39:57] righteousness is of me saith the LORD
[40:00] they're just our Justice is of him it's
[40:06] our heritage it's our portion
[40:19] let's look in Isaiah 59 19
[40:40] oh sure they feared the name of the Lord
[40:42] from the West and his glory from the
[40:45] rising of the Sun when the enemy shall
[40:48] come in like a flood the Spirit of the
[40:51] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[40:53] him now that word standard means a way
[40:58] of escape live up a wave xscape it also
[41:02] a standard means a banner they would the
[41:06] the children of Israel when they came
[41:09] forth and as they were set up according
[41:12] to the tribes after they came out of
[41:14] Egypt they each had a standard or a flag
[41:17] or a banner for each tribe and each one
[41:21] of them represented something and it is
[41:27] always been a time that when those went
[41:31] in anyone went into war to battle they
[41:34] always had a standard or a flag as we
[41:36] would call it that went out before them
[41:39] and here he's going to lift up a
[41:43] standard before him a wave xscape in
[41:48] Exodus 1715 I want to just read this it
[41:52] says Moses built an altar and called the
[41:54] name of it Jehovah nessa which means the
[41:58] Lord is our banner
[41:59] he's our standard he's the one that he
[42:04] that is our wave Escape is in the Lord
[42:16] look with me in Psalms 25 through seven
[42:35] you
[42:40] it says we will rejoice in thy salvation
[42:43] in the name of our God we will set up
[42:47] our banners the Lord fulfill all thy
[42:50] petitions know now know that no I that
[42:57] the Lord sayeth his anointed he will
[43:00] hear him with his home with his holy
[43:04] heaven with the from his holy heaven
[43:08] with the saving strength of his right
[43:10] hand some trust in chariots summon
[43:16] horses but we will remember the name of
[43:18] the Lord and it says now I know that the
[43:25] Lord sayeth his anointed that he will
[43:27] hear him with his holy heaven from his
[43:30] holy heaven with the saving strength of
[43:32] his right hand Isaiah 59 and one says
[43:35] behold the Lord's hand is not shortened
[43:38] that it cannot save neither is his ear
[43:42] heavy that means dull or insensitive
[43:45] that it cannot hear he hears our cry and
[43:50] his hand is able to reach to every
[43:52] situation that we have some trust in
[43:59] chariots summon horses but we will
[44:04] remember the name of the Lord our God
[44:07] made me think of a song that we used to
[44:12] always sing in the name of Jesus we have
[44:15] the victory amen and I thought of how
[44:20] that when Peter and and John went out
[44:24] from the upper room and as they were
[44:26] going past a gate called beautiful
[44:29] Peter the thing that the saw stand that
[44:32] Peter said to the man that was there
[44:34] that was begging the Rose Lane he said
[44:37] silver and gold have I none but such as
[44:39] I have give are thee in the name of
[44:42] Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[44:46] walk
[44:47] in the name of Jesus amen we'll remember
[44:53] amen when we have nee when we're in
[44:56] trouble we remembered to call on his
[44:59] name and Peter reached out and took the
[45:02] man by the right hand and bidding to
[45:05] arise and it said that he rose up
[45:08] immediately and not only did he walk but
[45:11] he began to leap about amen
[45:14] there's power in the name of Jesus
[45:18] [Music]
[45:19] demons trembled at the name of Jesus
[45:24] amen Satan doesn't want to hear you call
[45:29] on the name of Jesus
[45:32] we'll remember well we call to mind to
[45:38] remember the name of our Lord and his
[45:43] songs of Solomon it talks about he talks
[45:47] about his bride being terrible as an
[45:50] army with banners meaning that an army
[45:54] that went forth in time of war as they
[45:57] would have their banners set before them
[45:58] there would be symbolic images and and
[46:02] things that wrote on them and these
[46:05] things were meant to not only unite the
[46:09] people who was marching behind them but
[46:11] it was also meant to strike terror in
[46:14] the hearts of their enemies for many
[46:17] times on those banners would be the
[46:21] would be things that would declare past
[46:25] victories that would declare that they
[46:28] had been in battle and had won victories
[46:31] and it would be a declaration of that
[46:33] and it was to to strike fear into the
[46:37] heart of the enemy I'll tell you want
[46:38] friends we have a banner tonight and
[46:41] that is Christ Jesus and he has defeated
[46:45] every foe that ever came against him if
[46:49] we'll stay friends what the devil likes
[46:52] to do is get our focus on ourselves our
[46:56] situation
[46:57] and how small we are and how
[46:59] insignificant and how uncapable that we
[47:02] are but he's already won the victory he
[47:08] is our banner and it's a blood-stained
[47:10] banner tonight where he overcame death
[47:15] hell and the grave and he took away the
[47:18] keys I love the way said he took the way
[47:21] Satan's own keys Satan doesn't have keys
[47:25] to his own house anymore
[47:27] Jesus said I have them in the time
[47:35] before Israel came out of Egypt we know
[47:39] that there was many plagues that came
[47:42] upon Egypt and then the last plague was
[47:46] the death angel was to pass through and
[47:49] they were instructed to put blood on the
[47:53] doorposts on the windows of the door and
[47:56] it was to be a token to them that when
[47:58] the death angel solid he would pass over
[48:00] that token there's also the word for
[48:04] banner it was a banner it was a standard
[48:09] that was raised up against the Death
[48:12] Angel the Death Angel couldn't pass over
[48:15] that standard but everyone that wasn't
[48:19] behind that standard the firstborn of
[48:22] everything man beast and all died
[48:39] the Wrentham says this in revelation of
[48:42] Jesus Christ he says now remember this
[48:45] Christ in the truth church is a
[48:49] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[48:53] book of Revelation shows how that the
[48:55] Antichrist spirit would come into the
[48:57] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[48:59] formal and powerless it exposes Satan
[49:03] revealing his works attempted
[49:06] destruction of God's people and the
[49:08] discrediting of God's Word right down to
[49:11] the time he's cast into the lake of fire
[49:13] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[49:19] knows that if the people get the true
[49:20] revelation of the true church and what
[49:23] she is and what she stands for that she
[49:26] can do the greater works she will be an
[49:29] invincible army Satan knows that if you
[49:33] get your faith aligned with this word
[49:36] that you are invincible and that's why
[49:40] he tries to get your focus off that
[49:43] that's why he tries to use scare tactics
[49:46] he'll try to to get us thinking that I
[49:53] one time I was having trouble with my
[49:55] throat I'll give you an example I was
[49:57] having trouble my throat I was having
[49:59] trouble swallowing and I thought well
[50:02] I'm gonna have to go to the doctor it's
[50:03] really giving me a lot of problems and
[50:05] and I didn't know what it was and then
[50:08] somebody came by was visiting with me in
[50:11] debt and they said yeah her brother had
[50:12] that and he died they rushed him to the
[50:16] hospital and turned out to be cancer and
[50:18] he died from it right away this thought
[50:20] went all man you got throat cancer see
[50:25] that's the way the devil works it worked
[50:27] that way too right away to tell you it's
[50:29] something real bad but the thing is
[50:33] don't accept that
[50:36] the devil was trying to tell me that and
[50:39] I hadn't even been to see the doctor yet
[50:44] don't Satan that's the way comes what to
[50:47] try to strike fear because where fear is
[50:53] faith can't take root the perfect love
[51:01] casts out fear amen and I I knew in my
[51:08] heart I love the Lord and I knew the
[51:11] Lord loved me and I knew that Satan
[51:15] couldn't touch me with anything unless
[51:17] the Lord would let him and I was not
[51:20] gonna leave this earth til it was my
[51:22] time and the Lord
[51:23] bit me home so I said I'm not gonna
[51:26] listen to that you know when I went in
[51:30] they just said I had acid reflux and
[51:32] that it had scarred my throat and that's
[51:37] what was the scar tissue building up was
[51:39] closing off my throat while I was having
[51:41] trouble swallowing and all that you know
[51:43] and they just stretched my throat out
[51:45] and everything was fine
[51:50] see that's the way it is it could be
[51:54] something just real simple what's going
[51:56] on but Satan will try to blow it out of
[51:58] proportion feel something comes up and
[52:02] you think all men the sky is falling and
[52:06] it's not and we go around running like
[52:11] Chicken Little the sky is falling the
[52:13] sky is falling
[52:14] look out everything that's going to go
[52:20] wrong it seems to be going wrong you
[52:25] know I said to my mom today under ideal
[52:31] situation under ideal circumstances you
[52:35] could never go through a trial if all
[52:38] these the circumstances were ideal but
[52:41] they're not that's not the way it is
[52:44] that's not the way life is and that's
[52:47] not the way God leads
[52:49] Shubh he led the children of Israel one
[52:52] of the first places they came to was the
[52:54] river was the the waters of Myra which
[52:58] means bitter to the first place they
[53:01] come to was these bitter waters why
[53:06] would he lead his children into these
[53:07] waters that were bitter that they
[53:09] couldn't even drink it was so that he
[53:14] could show them that he was Jehovah God
[53:18] and they instructed Moses said take
[53:22] these branches down and lay them over
[53:25] into the water when they did it turned
[53:27] the water sweet many times we think the
[53:34] situation we're in is real complicated
[53:37] and we think you know boy this is going
[53:41] to be a real task you get this
[53:42] straightened out but with the Lord it
[53:46] was just a simple thing I when I was on
[53:59] my way back home from this last trip I
[54:02] got down to Columbus Ohio and and
[54:06] traffic was coming to a stop that
[54:08] somebody ran into the back of my truck
[54:10] and then my first thought was I hadn't
[54:14] had it two months and I you know got
[54:23] pulled over to the side and I was
[54:25] standing out there waiting on the police
[54:26] to come to make a police report and but
[54:31] they had so many accidents going on that
[54:33] with the injuries and that that they
[54:36] told us said if there's no injuries just
[54:38] exchange information and go on we ain't
[54:41] got time to stop for everybody there
[54:45] were so many accidents and so I was
[54:49] standing there so we just chained the
[54:51] information I went home and I said well
[54:52] it's just gonna delay me and it did it
[54:55] delayed me by a day from my original
[54:56] plans but I don't know why it had to
[54:59] happen I still don't know the thing that
[55:02] I
[55:03] you know God had his hand on me and what
[55:06] I one of the things that I was right
[55:08] away thankful for was that no one was
[55:11] hurt not just myself but the young lady
[55:14] who was driving the car behind me her
[55:17] and she had another young girl in the
[55:18] car was it neither one of them were hurt
[55:20] and I thank the Lord for that that no
[55:24] one got hurt and it was only these two
[55:26] vehicles involved and and not any other
[55:29] people or any other vehicles and I don't
[55:31] know how you know or why it happened or
[55:34] I don't even know exactly how it
[55:36] happened I just know that I was glad to
[55:41] get stopped and then hurt a crunch and
[55:47] so but I don't have to know what
[55:50] happened you know maybe there maybe
[55:54] there was a need for God to delay me a
[55:56] day from when I said and I don't know
[56:02] and I may never know but the thing is I
[56:05] don't have to know because I know that
[56:07] his hand is upon me and wherever I go
[56:11] and whatever I'm doing he's watching out
[56:14] for me he knows things that I don't know
[56:19] he can see things I can't see who knows
[56:25] what may have laid up ahead maybe it
[56:28] wasn't to delay me by a day maybe it was
[56:30] to delay me by an hour I don't I don't
[56:35] know but I know that he had his hand
[56:38] upon me and there was no injuries and
[56:40] the truck fixed and there's no big deal
[56:43] you know I I didn't get angry or
[56:50] anything I just was really uh really
[56:54] down about it I wasn't I wasn't mad at
[56:59] the girl or mad at anybody else - I
[57:01] wasn't hollering nothing like that I
[57:03] just was I just felt really down about
[57:06] the thing that here was my truck smashed
[57:08] in the back but when I took it in they
[57:12] sure me they could make it look new and
[57:13] they did and
[57:16] Oh for whatever reason it was while it
[57:19] served its purpose was no scent there
[57:24] was no reason to be upset about it
[57:27] everything was gonna be all right every
[57:33] tongue that shall rise against the end
[57:35] judgement shot by condemn I tell you
[57:37] Satan works constantly to try to bring
[57:42] false accusations against you by myself
[57:48] [Music]
[57:52] one of the one of the boys that we had
[57:56] took and adopted and raised well he
[57:59] wanted to go live with his his birth
[58:02] mother after some time because he didn't
[58:04] like our rules and and he didn't want to
[58:07] abide by them and I let him go because I
[58:12] was tired of him not abiding by him and
[58:15] staying you know sneaking out of the
[58:17] house and staying gone two three or four
[58:19] in the morning and coming in not knowing
[58:21] where he been and what was going on or
[58:23] what kind of trouble he was gonna get
[58:24] into or what kind of trouble he was
[58:26] gonna get me into and then you know then
[58:31] the disrespect that he showed and all
[58:34] that and so I let him I said you can go
[58:36] and so there he was and then we were
[58:40] going through that thing with you with
[58:42] the one of the girls that I told you
[58:44] about when I was here - last time and
[58:46] while we were going through that while
[58:48] he wanted his sister he wanted us to let
[58:50] her go to come stay where he was staying
[58:52] and I said I'm not letting her out of my
[58:55] sight and I'm not letting her to be
[58:57] influenced by anyone else and long as
[59:02] the court case is going on I was gonna
[59:03] keep my eye on her and so he when I
[59:08] wouldn't do when he wanted why him and
[59:11] his girlfriend got together and they
[59:12] went on Facebook and they wrote up this
[59:14] big old long long long thing bunch of
[59:18] lies about us and our family and about
[59:23] how that that girl had been abused and
[59:27] all kinds of other things they accused
[59:29] us of doing and and that and they just
[59:31] it was horrible
[59:32] and so my wife she printed it off and so
[59:44] they they had blocked her on Facebook
[59:49] from her seeing it dad blocked her I
[59:51] don't know how all that works but I was
[59:54] I was raising pups and selling pups and
[59:57] I was advertising on Facebook and I
[59:59] wasn't advertising them under my name
[1:00:00] and so then none of them knew I had a
[1:00:03] Facebook because it was just about my
[1:00:05] dogs and so my wife said he'd go on your
[1:00:10] Facebook and see if I can get in and see
[1:00:11] what they broke but somebody told us
[1:00:13] about it
[1:00:14] and she printed this stuff off and it
[1:00:16] was horrible didn't what was even the
[1:00:18] worst part about it the prosecuting
[1:00:20] attorney on the case we were dealing
[1:00:22] with got ahold of it and so she was
[1:00:26] gonna bring him in as some kind of
[1:00:27] witness which all he had was a bunch of
[1:00:29] lie and it was really hurtful thing and
[1:00:33] I thought well some of the things they
[1:00:36] said I thought the next thing you know
[1:00:38] what we're gonna have the animal
[1:00:40] protection we got here on us because
[1:00:42] some of the stuff that he had said about
[1:00:45] how we treated animals or whatever and
[1:00:48] those you all know me they've known me
[1:00:52] for years but you know how wouldn't
[1:00:53] mistreat no animals and I it was it
[1:01:00] really hurt all these lies he made up
[1:01:03] and then they went and reported all this
[1:01:10] stuff to all the different news agencies
[1:01:11] and I guess they were going to try to
[1:01:15] force us to give up that girl but I well
[1:01:20] I'm not going to do it and I told them I
[1:01:26] said she's going to stay with us until
[1:01:28] this court trials over with I said and
[1:01:32] then after that then we'll see and
[1:01:37] but you know just the they they came din
[1:01:43] later
[1:01:44] knocked on the door on him on to that
[1:01:46] was that all happened on a Thursday and
[1:01:48] on Monday they him and the girlfriend
[1:01:51] came in knocked on the door and ever
[1:01:52] seen sorry and all this in the other you
[1:01:54] know and I don't know why they were
[1:01:57] saying sorry but I've been praying for
[1:01:59] for God to do something to take that
[1:02:01] down but even by the time they took it
[1:02:04] down it has spread all over the place
[1:02:06] and being it was down in Tennessee why
[1:02:09] it spread to even some of the other
[1:02:10] churches down there and I called up a
[1:02:12] friend of mine was telling him hey if
[1:02:14] you see this stuff or anybody under
[1:02:15] seasoned you know I'll tell you what it
[1:02:18] is he's telling a bunch of lies because
[1:02:20] he's trying to force me to do something
[1:02:21] he want and so even even the the girl
[1:02:28] she told that when the lawyer and the
[1:02:32] prosecutor showed her what they had
[1:02:34] printed off she told him she says that's
[1:02:36] a lie she's my they never treated us
[1:02:39] like that so even her with all her lies
[1:02:42] and what she was trying to force our
[1:02:45] hand everything she said in all that
[1:02:47] ain't true
[1:02:48] you know and so the lawyers couldn't
[1:02:52] couldn't try to use that against us
[1:02:54] saying you know that she didn't have a
[1:02:56] good home environment and you know after
[1:03:03] they took it down you know and and but
[1:03:07] it had already got out there and it hurt
[1:03:09] and it hurt to even think about it but
[1:03:13] the thing is and I thought about this
[1:03:16] scripture every tongue that shot rise
[1:03:17] against the in judgment thou shalt
[1:03:20] condemn and here they had said these
[1:03:25] things that weren't true and they had
[1:03:33] persisted to try to bring accusation
[1:03:38] against us but they're the ones that's
[1:03:41] going to be guilty because you
[1:03:49] you know anyone that would lie on a
[1:03:55] child of God is in trouble
[1:03:58] that's the truth but one thing that he
[1:04:02] should have known better than was that
[1:04:05] the Lord said touch not my anointed to
[1:04:07] do my prophets no harm and his own
[1:04:14] maternal grandmother she did some things
[1:04:17] against us said some things and then
[1:04:22] called up and left a message on my
[1:04:24] machine this had been some time before
[1:04:27] all this she left it just a horrible
[1:04:30] message to me in and then my mom was
[1:04:35] down visiting and we went to drive over
[1:04:37] password that her grandmother had worked
[1:04:40] there at a local newspaper she was
[1:04:43] outside in the front smoking a cigarette
[1:04:44] when we drove by and when she saw me she
[1:04:47] coming
[1:04:49] she just quickly turned turned her back
[1:04:51] like this and I said I don't know if my
[1:04:54] mom remembers as I said all I wish she
[1:04:56] hadn't done that I wish she hadn't have
[1:04:59] done that there wasn't no time after
[1:05:02] that she had a stroke she ended up in a
[1:05:05] nursing home and before she left here my
[1:05:08] daughter was one of the nurses end up
[1:05:10] taking care of her and before she left
[1:05:12] here my daughter said she had lost her
[1:05:14] mind completely you can't you can't
[1:05:20] touch God's children and think you'll
[1:05:22] get by with it and I even to her own
[1:05:29] daughter warned her and said mom don't
[1:05:31] say them things about him or do those
[1:05:33] things you don't know he's a man of God
[1:05:35] but brother branham says he said I was
[1:05:43] thinking today this isn't a Redemption
[1:05:44] by power how that this day we're going
[1:05:47] to have to answer for I'm going to have
[1:05:49] to answer for the questions that was
[1:05:53] before me or the generation that will be
[1:05:55] after me but in judgment I'm just then
[1:06:00] I'm not going to have to answer
[1:06:02] for the generation that was before me or
[1:06:04] the generation was after me but in the
[1:06:07] judgment I'll stand with this generation
[1:06:09] and I said with all the preaching I said
[1:06:16] sometimes it seems I told my wife
[1:06:18] sometimes it seems it doesn't do any
[1:06:20] good but I've gotten to be the voice of
[1:06:23] warning anyhow regardless of what the
[1:06:25] people does about it I've got to preach
[1:06:28] the gospel anyhow and give a witness
[1:06:30] under the resurrection of the power of
[1:06:32] Jesus Christ that then forsake it turn
[1:06:35] their back God will judge them at the
[1:06:37] judgement for it I'm only responsible
[1:06:40] for preaching and other ministers to who
[1:06:43] preached the gospel and here Moses he
[1:06:49] told him to lift up the rod that rod was
[1:06:53] a judgement rod now it wasn't Moses rod
[1:06:56] it was God's rod if you notice Moses he
[1:06:59] took the rod he held it like this
[1:07:01] pleasecome
[1:07:03] he hovered over the waters to turn the
[1:07:04] blood it was God's judgment rod and that
[1:07:08] same rod get it that same rod was what
[1:07:11] he smoked the rock with and the cleft
[1:07:14] come in the side of the rock and the
[1:07:15] waters came out of the rock now the rock
[1:07:18] was Christ and it was God's judgment the
[1:07:22] day you eat thereof the day you'll die
[1:07:24] smoke Christ at Calvary and paid that
[1:07:28] bitter agonizing death no man could ever
[1:07:33] describe what it was or never will their
[1:07:36] God placed all the divine judgment upon
[1:07:39] him and smote him in a sign when out of
[1:07:42] his side come water and blood and spirit
[1:07:44] for our Redemption remember the
[1:07:47] preaching of this word will stand in the
[1:07:49] judgement and a heart to stand behind it
[1:07:52] and I'll have to be a witness to that I
[1:07:55] can't take it back I've done said it I
[1:07:59] got to stay with that it's going to meet
[1:08:02] me in the judgment just as God said his
[1:08:05] word can't be tucked back now I weigh
[1:08:09] every word first of my heart to see if I
[1:08:12] want to say it myself I
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:17] say it God has me say it I say it anyhow
[1:08:21] cause it's him I want to be sure because
[1:08:24] I don't want any mistakes at that day
[1:08:35] they tried to this word here where it's
[1:08:40] talking about if every tongue that shall
[1:08:42] rise against the end judgment it's not
[1:08:44] talking about necessarily be judgment
[1:08:46] it just it means any tongue that would
[1:08:51] rise to get you to say something to
[1:08:53] bring some kind of accusation against
[1:08:57] you that but it's God why would they do
[1:09:05] something like that because they don't
[1:09:08] like the spirit that's in them doesn't
[1:09:10] like the spirit that's in you pardon me
[1:09:31] people should be more careful but you
[1:09:37] know what we're living in a time and
[1:09:39] generation where there's less respect
[1:09:43] now lenders I think then there's ever
[1:09:44] been on the time of this earth children
[1:09:47] don't respect parents they don't respect
[1:09:49] teachers they don't respect elders
[1:09:51] they're not taught to respect them it's
[1:09:55] because they're being raised by a
[1:09:57] generation who who were a bunch of
[1:09:59] renegades you and I think about the
[1:10:04] professor's that's in the college in the
[1:10:08] 60s that were probably smoking pot now
[1:10:12] they're now they're in the colleges as
[1:10:14] elder professors they got all these
[1:10:19] liberal ways of thinking they tried to
[1:10:23] teach him pass on to this generation
[1:10:27] come from a generation where they didn't
[1:10:30] want to call mom and dad mom and dad
[1:10:32] anymore they wanted to instead of
[1:10:35] calling mom and dad they wanted to call
[1:10:36] him by their name disrespect and now
[1:10:41] we're living in a time of complete
[1:10:43] disrespect program says in the midst of
[1:10:51] professions you know it's going to be
[1:10:52] awful dark down at the river that day
[1:10:55] ain't going to be nobody there to help
[1:10:57] you you ain't going to take no money
[1:11:00] down there
[1:11:01] your friends are going to be in the same
[1:11:03] shape you are in it's going to be an
[1:11:06] awful dark you got it cross I want to be
[1:11:09] sure my tickets right I want to be sure
[1:11:13] when I look up that I see the red blood
[1:11:16] banner of my master that's what I want
[1:11:21] to know that I've come underneath that
[1:11:23] blood of Jesus Christ and that the
[1:11:26] judgments of God I don't come into the
[1:11:29] condemnation the judgments of God are
[1:11:32] held back why because we've already
[1:11:34] allowed ourselves to be judged here by
[1:11:36] God and by His Word
[1:11:41] then when I hear after wild the old ship
[1:11:46] blow it's going to be alright then I
[1:11:49] don't want no trouble down there then I
[1:11:52] want it settled in here now if there's
[1:11:55] any trouble I want it settled now I'm
[1:11:58] going to need every bit of grace I can
[1:12:00] get at that day I'm gonna be honest we
[1:12:05] need every bit of grace surgeons would
[1:12:14] see Jesus said all around over the
[1:12:19] country you find I said to some of my
[1:12:23] friends that was with me and I said I
[1:12:24] wonder what it'll be when we cross over
[1:12:27] the other side and all this generation
[1:12:30] stands up in the judgment those I've
[1:12:32] preached to and those I'll have to stand
[1:12:35] as a witness for or against God will
[1:12:39] know all things where they received or
[1:12:40] whether they did not and the attitude
[1:12:42] they've taken and what it'll be then
[1:12:44] when it in to millions around the world
[1:12:49] I thought about these children that we
[1:12:55] took in to raise we adopted him we gave
[1:12:58] them we gave him love we gave them what
[1:13:02] we didn't treat him any different than
[1:13:04] we did the first four that were born to
[1:13:07] us we stood in court and we raised our
[1:13:12] hand and swear to the judge that we
[1:13:14] would treat those children just like as
[1:13:15] if they had been born to it that was the
[1:13:17] very words we had to swear when we were
[1:13:20] adopting them and and we did and they've
[1:13:26] had grand opportunities
[1:13:29] Madison the oldest girl she's still with
[1:13:33] us she's 19 years old he's graduated
[1:13:40] high school she's completed two EMT
[1:13:44] course she goes out on she voluntarily
[1:13:49] goes out on rides with these EMTs
[1:13:51] different times who were volunteer work
[1:13:55] she's working as a CNA at the nursing
[1:13:58] home were my daughter Jessica worked and
[1:14:00] she signed up to go to college to become
[1:14:03] a nurse and college starts here in
[1:14:07] September she starts in to school for
[1:14:09] that and not only that but she received
[1:14:14] they are paying completely for her
[1:14:17] schooling and because of other things
[1:14:21] that she done in this while she was in
[1:14:23] high school she got other to call it I
[1:14:27] guess scholarships she even got a
[1:14:30] scholarship from the Red Cross and you
[1:14:34] know the other ones the other three
[1:14:37] leftist had the same opportunity to make
[1:14:41] something of themselves and one day I
[1:14:44] know they'll look back and you'll see
[1:14:45] they missed it it was this year if the
[1:14:49] oldest boy would have stayed with us and
[1:14:51] followed through he would have graduated
[1:14:52] from college this year but instead he's
[1:14:58] out somewhere trying to make a go of it
[1:15:01] by starting his own little businesses
[1:15:03] which is failure after failure because
[1:15:06] he tries to take a shortcut with
[1:15:08] everything and because he didn't want to
[1:15:10] serve God that's why he wanted to leave
[1:15:12] us cuz he he wanted to do worldly things
[1:15:16] and wanted to have a live-in girlfriend
[1:15:18] and all these other things and he knows
[1:15:21] it's wrong but one day they'll they'll
[1:15:24] look back and they'll see the
[1:15:25] opportunities that they walked over top
[1:15:27] of us and left you know and here will is
[1:15:31] the youngest boy still when is he
[1:15:33] starting high school this year just
[1:15:35] started as a freshman and we're doing
[1:15:39] all we can to point him in the right
[1:15:41] direction just keep him in prayer
[1:15:43] because I know in these high schools why
[1:15:46] there's all kinds of things to try to
[1:15:48] distract them and I just want him to
[1:15:52] have his life just firmly dedicated to
[1:15:54] the Lord where he can overcome these
[1:15:57] things of the temptations of the world
[1:16:00] but I know that they not only had these
[1:16:08] opportunities for bettering themselves
[1:16:14] in those ways but they were kept in the
[1:16:19] house of the Lord and they were taught
[1:16:22] the things of the Lord
[1:16:24] and they know better than the stuff
[1:16:27] they're doing I talked to the oldest boy
[1:16:30] on the phone he told me I know better I
[1:16:31] know I'm wrong he said but I I just
[1:16:36] can't come back to church he said cuz I
[1:16:38] don't know if I'm ready to quit doing
[1:16:40] this stuff and serve God in the judgment
[1:16:46] some day if they don't turn around we'll
[1:16:49] stand as a witness that will stand as a
[1:16:51] witness against them they had
[1:16:52] opportunity they were raised by parents
[1:16:55] that kept him in church kept of the word
[1:16:58] there gave them good examples and
[1:17:01] they'll it will stand as a witness
[1:17:04] against them in that day they won't be
[1:17:06] able to say well God I didn't cause I
[1:17:09] had a bad dad and I had a bad mom and
[1:17:12] all this in the other and don't be no
[1:17:14] excuses because God gave them
[1:17:18] opportunity the Bible says this is the
[1:17:24] heritage of the servants of the Lord
[1:17:26] it's this is what falls to us it's our
[1:17:32] heritage that no weapon would prosper
[1:17:34] it's our heritage that no tongue would
[1:17:38] be able to rise against us in judgment
[1:17:40] it belongs to us whether I'm said not
[1:17:45] only do the things we can see belong to
[1:17:48] us he said that we are heirs to the
[1:17:50] things that you cannot see
[1:17:55] we're heirs he said to all the temporal
[1:17:57] things you can see said we're heirs to
[1:17:59] this world but he says we're also heirs
[1:18:03] to two things you can't see like healing
[1:18:08] divine healing summon you you can't see
[1:18:13] it but yet it's there amen and
[1:18:22] there's only there was only one way
[1:18:27] brother Bentham said to get anywhere
[1:18:29] with God and that is to believe that he
[1:18:34] is here and he's a rewarder of those
[1:18:36] that diligently seek Him you've got to
[1:18:39] believe that you've got to have faith to
[1:18:42] believe that I've told you the truth and
[1:18:46] I would not tell you unless first I know
[1:18:49] that it was true and I'm sure though me
[1:18:53] being a man and subject to mistakes that
[1:18:55] God is infallible and can't make a
[1:18:58] mistake
[1:19:01] he said if you believe according to your
[1:19:04] faith be it unto you
[1:19:08] how does this work the he that no weapon
[1:19:15] would prosper because we have faith to
[1:19:19] believe that's God's Word and that's our
[1:19:22] heritage
[1:19:23] I believe no weapon will prosper I
[1:19:27] believe that no tongue will be able to
[1:19:30] stand up in judgment against a child of
[1:19:33] God
[1:19:44] or the venom said in the church age book
[1:19:50] said their righteous is of me saith the
[1:19:55] Lord the Jews did not call him holy then
[1:19:59] they do not call him holy now but he is
[1:20:01] the holy one where thou shall not leave
[1:20:04] my soul in Hell neither without suffer
[1:20:06] thy Holy One to see corruption
[1:20:08] they sought their own righteousness
[1:20:11] after the law and failed miserably
[1:20:15] for by the law can no flesh be justified
[1:20:20] by the law can no man be made holy
[1:20:24] holiness is of the Lord any quotes but
[1:20:29] of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God
[1:20:34] is made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[1:20:37] and sanctification and redemption and he
[1:20:42] quotes again that we might be made the
[1:20:44] righteousness of God in him it was
[1:20:48] Christ or perish and they perished for
[1:20:52] they refused him the men of that age
[1:20:55] even as today were making the same
[1:20:58] mistakes as the Jews took refuge in the
[1:21:00] synagogue form of worship so in the
[1:21:04] Philadelphia age they were taking refuge
[1:21:06] in the church it's not joining a church
[1:21:09] that counts the life is not in the
[1:21:13] church the life is in Christ this is the
[1:21:18] record that God has given us eternal
[1:21:20] life that this life is in his son he
[1:21:24] than half the son hath life he that hath
[1:21:26] not the son hath not life and he says
[1:21:30] again but if the spirit of him that
[1:21:32] raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in
[1:21:34] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:21:36] dead
[1:21:36] she also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:21:38] his Spirit that dwelleth in you man is
[1:21:41] made holy by the Spirit it is a spirit
[1:21:46] of holiness that raised Jesus from the
[1:21:48] dead that dwells in us and makes us holy
[1:21:52] and His Holiness there he stands the
[1:21:55] holy one we will stand with him clothed
[1:21:58] his righteousness holy with his holiness
[1:22:01] oh I'm so glad that my holiness is not
[1:22:04] of myself I'm glad that I'm in Christ
[1:22:08] with all his wonderful attributes of
[1:22:11] righteousness imparted unto me
[1:22:32] rather random in this message of faces
[1:22:35] of substance he was preaching of course
[1:22:37] on faith and he talked about people
[1:22:40] coming into prayer line he said that
[1:22:42] would say they had faith and he said and
[1:22:44] some of them he said were suffering from
[1:22:46] cancer and citizen I knew they didn't
[1:22:48] have enough faith to be healed from a
[1:22:49] toothache and he said but faith it's a
[1:22:54] substance of things hoped for the
[1:22:56] evidence of things not seen
[1:22:59] see it's a substance it's something
[1:23:02] direct something that you really have
[1:23:05] not something you're imagining something
[1:23:08] that you think you have but it's some
[1:23:11] direct positive act that you have you
[1:23:15] see what I mean it's a substance and
[1:23:16] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:23:19] not seen
[1:23:19] let's take part of this scripture the
[1:23:23] substance of things hoped for there's
[1:23:25] three things Hope charity and faith is
[1:23:27] that right now hope is one element faith
[1:23:30] is another element charity is another
[1:23:32] element charities love I've seen many
[1:23:35] people come here by lovely people real
[1:23:38] Christians but didn't have enough faith
[1:23:39] to be healed and some sinner passed by
[1:23:42] and has faith to be healed it's another
[1:23:46] element all together it's not how well
[1:23:49] you serve God it's an element that you
[1:23:54] possess yourself it's not how well you
[1:23:57] serve God but it's if you're fully
[1:23:59] persuaded how is it that no weapon of
[1:24:06] prospered because we're fully persuaded
[1:24:09] that's God's Word and no matter what
[1:24:12] comes up against us it'll not prosper it
[1:24:16] will not get victory over us it will not
[1:24:19] defeat us because we already have the
[1:24:22] victory in Christ Jesus
[1:24:32] the laburnum was talking about Elizabeth
[1:24:35] and how he said that it couldn't seem
[1:24:39] like didn't seem like maybe she was
[1:24:41] pregnant but said the angel of the Lord
[1:24:43] had spoke to her and though they many
[1:24:49] wouldn't believe it because they said
[1:24:50] she was bearing brother BAM says she was
[1:24:55] looking to the unseen then God's
[1:24:59] promises if you'll look to the unseen
[1:25:01] then God's promises always produce what
[1:25:04] is asked for we asked the Lord we you
[1:25:09] know I go to the Lord and I pray to him
[1:25:12] like I was just talking to someone I let
[1:25:15] him know how I'm feeling that way if I'm
[1:25:18] not feeling right if I got a wrong view
[1:25:20] on something we can get it straightened
[1:25:22] out amen if if something has bothered me
[1:25:28] in a way to where I don't go around
[1:25:30] pouting about it well somebody's hurt my
[1:25:33] feelings well I get down and I pray and
[1:25:35] I tell God how I'm feeling how it's
[1:25:37] bothering me
[1:25:38] you know and if it's on me then we can
[1:25:42] get that straightened out I can get over
[1:25:44] that little petty feeling you know
[1:25:47] hallelujah because you don't want
[1:25:49] brother BAM said you seem like your
[1:25:52] brother do something against should go
[1:25:54] and pray for him you'll find out after
[1:25:56] wise not wasn't your brother it was the
[1:25:58] devil amen
[1:26:02] sometimes people will say something and
[1:26:05] and they don't mean it the way you end
[1:26:07] up taking it and but the devil will jump
[1:26:12] on that and get you before you know it
[1:26:15] your thoughts is doesn't ran a million
[1:26:17] miles off with it and you got this
[1:26:20] before you know it you got this person
[1:26:22] like that they're against you when
[1:26:24] they're not against you at all the devil
[1:26:28] tries to work on feelings like that
[1:26:30] I pulled the church back home we need to
[1:26:33] get our focus off these little petty
[1:26:35] feelings and things and get our focus on
[1:26:38] where we're at we're at the end time
[1:26:41] we're getting ready to take a rapture
[1:26:43] and what our focus should be on is Lord
[1:26:45] what do I need to take this rapture
[1:26:48] where am i lacking one of my yet missing
[1:26:51] what because we know we have to be
[1:26:53] perfect to go Lord when we're in is it
[1:26:58] outside of this flesh what do I need and
[1:27:04] I ask the people I said I'm not going to
[1:27:07] ask you to raise your hand or to
[1:27:09] actually tell me but think this to
[1:27:11] yourself
[1:27:12] when's the last time you prayed for the
[1:27:14] preacher before you come to church you
[1:27:18] know we should be praying for one
[1:27:21] another we should be praying for this
[1:27:23] service and if you got any complaints
[1:27:27] about what's being preached didn't start
[1:27:28] praying about it so our dumb Lord gave
[1:27:34] me to preach something else let's see
[1:27:37] how far that gets you
[1:27:45] we should put the Lord first that's
[1:27:47] where our focus should be as you know
[1:27:52] the man of God came down there was a
[1:27:55] little woman she was getting two sticks
[1:27:57] to go make a fire and he said go make me
[1:28:02] a cake first and she said I only got
[1:28:05] enough cake enough meal and enough all
[1:28:08] to make one cake for me and a lad we're
[1:28:10] gonna eat it and then we're gonna die
[1:28:12] and he said make me a cake first and
[1:28:16] said the mill barrel never will be empty
[1:28:21] in the crew so all will never run dry
[1:28:23] nor the RAM said see she had to put God
[1:28:27] first
[1:28:27] we should always put God first he says
[1:28:32] she put God before her children she put
[1:28:36] God before anything else she taken the
[1:28:39] kingdom of God first God must have first
[1:28:43] place in your
[1:28:44] first place in your life first place and
[1:28:47] everything you do and what or what you
[1:28:49] are first place in your God must be
[1:28:53] first he doesn't want the second place
[1:28:56] he doesn't deserve the second place he
[1:28:59] deserves the best and the first and all
[1:29:02] that we've got he deserves it
[1:29:04] blessed be his holy name for God also
[1:29:08] bearing witness he gave testimony both
[1:29:12] with signs and wonders and divers
[1:29:14] miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:16] according to his own will not what men's
[1:29:19] not what men say what the church said
[1:29:23] but what God's will was what we need to
[1:29:26] seek the will of God not the favor of
[1:29:29] our neighbor not the favor of your
[1:29:31] children not the favor of your husband
[1:29:34] or your wife but seek the will of God
[1:29:37] and do that first maybe y'all don't have
[1:29:49] any family troubles up here we get him
[1:29:52] down our way but you know what what
[1:29:59] comes first is God not family and if
[1:30:06] we'll put him first he said he was the
[1:30:14] eternal one an object of worship he had
[1:30:17] nothing to worship and there was no
[1:30:18] angels no nothing but God alone him
[1:30:21] alone is eternal but in the order to be
[1:30:24] God
[1:30:25] there had to be something to worship Him
[1:30:28] so he created angels and beans and
[1:30:30] cherubims and so forth and worship him
[1:30:32] his great clam began to unfold his great
[1:30:36] plan but remember you in the stature
[1:30:40] that you are in this warning if you
[1:30:43] wasn't in his thinking then you're not
[1:30:45] now for you there's some part that's in
[1:30:50] you that's eternal there eternal and
[1:30:54] eternal only belongs to God and in God
[1:30:58] was his thinking of you sitting right
[1:30:59] where you are now it is thinking I stood
[1:31:03] at the pulpit this morning because he's
[1:31:05] infinite and knows all things therefore
[1:31:08] he could tell the infant beginning
[1:31:10] because he's eternal and you being a son
[1:31:13] or daughter of God then you were in his
[1:31:15] thinking at the beginning and then when
[1:31:18] the Holy Spirit come and you're on earth
[1:31:21] walking around here as a sinner way down
[1:31:24] in your life there there is something
[1:31:27] you don't know what's taking place but
[1:31:30] you're hungry
[1:31:31] I heard the presbyterian brother I heard
[1:31:34] the Baptist talking about back there and
[1:31:37] the Free Will Baptist preaching and my
[1:31:41] fellow brother that you there's
[1:31:43] something in you something that you
[1:31:45] never put in there is something that you
[1:31:48] couldn't desire to be in there is
[1:31:51] something that's contrary to your own
[1:31:53] nature
[1:31:54] it's the foreknowledge of God taking
[1:31:57] place God's Word say why did you read
[1:32:02] that to show you that you are ordained
[1:32:05] and the Bible says that there is no
[1:32:08] weapon that is ordained to prosper
[1:32:11] against you but you are ordained of God
[1:32:16] to win
[1:32:35] I believe if we get our focus right
[1:32:39] everything else is gonna fall in place I
[1:32:47] wanted to share one other thing with you
[1:32:49] before I close tonight brother Branham
[1:32:54] was talking about he saw this young
[1:32:55] woman said she was dancing across the
[1:33:01] floor where he was and said he saw her
[1:33:08] and then up to him walked to a person
[1:33:12] that he called dr. Brown and they got to
[1:33:17] talking and he and he said dr. Brown
[1:33:21] told him said we've got thousands of
[1:33:22] members and he said we sent out he said
[1:33:28] I sent out thousand cards and ask people
[1:33:31] if they pledge that they come on
[1:33:32] Wednesday night prayer meeting at least
[1:33:33] for six months in the year and he said
[1:33:37] do you know how I'm in he responded out
[1:33:39] of thousands he said five and brother
[1:33:44] Branham said you don't want he said you
[1:33:47] see that little girl over there dancing
[1:33:48] around across the floor he said that
[1:33:52] Clayton Mike Mitchell was spinning that
[1:33:55] old wildcat thing whatever it was you
[1:33:58] think that she he would have to get her
[1:34:02] to sign a card to come down there and
[1:34:04] dance he said do you think mr. Mike
[1:34:12] Mitch would have to have her sign a card
[1:34:14] to come on over there
[1:34:15] naw she pawned what clothes she had gone
[1:34:18] to get there for it's in her heart she
[1:34:21] couldn't live without it I said you get
[1:34:25] that bunch of lukewarm church members
[1:34:26] down there to the altar and let them
[1:34:29] pray through to the Holy Ghost sets
[1:34:30] their souls on fire and there'll be no
[1:34:33] signing cards
[1:34:36] and here's the part I wanted to get to
[1:34:38] you if God's in their heart God goes to
[1:34:43] church

[1:34:53] heart God goes to church
