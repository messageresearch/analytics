[38:25] Lord and ask you to anoint the lips and
[38:27] ears in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[38:32] amen let's look in our Bibles if you
[38:34] would to Exodus 15 in Exodus the
[38:42] fifteenth chapter and I just want to
[38:44] read just a few verses and then we're
[38:45] gonna just let you have your seats Bible
[38:55] says then sing Moses and the children of
[38:57] Israel this song unto the Lord and spake
[39:01] saying I will sing unto the Lord for he
[39:04] hath triumphed gloriously the horse and
[39:08] his rider hath he thrown into the sea
[39:12] the Lord is my strength and song and he
[39:17] has become my salvation he is my god and
[39:21] I will prepare him and habitation my
[39:24] father's God and I will exalt him the
[39:27] Lord is a man of war the Lord is his
[39:30] name Amen god bless you as you're being
[39:33] seated this evening I want to take that
[39:38] little thought here this evening for a
[39:41] few moments I will sing unto the Lord I
[39:45] will sing unto the Lord you think of
[39:50] where that Israel is standing here in
[39:54] this time and where they've just you
[39:59] know move from there the previous
[40:01] chapter of where that Pharaoh and his
[40:03] army was pursuing them we recognize that
[40:07] you know when Moses came to this place
[40:10] here then you know there was prophecy
[40:14] that went forth these Egyptians that you
[40:17] see today you'll see them no more and
[40:22] Moses had spoke with great authority the
[40:25] Spirit of God moving upon his heart that
[40:28] he would speak and expressed and still
[40:30] and see the salvation of the Lord and
[40:32] yet within the very next verse we we
[40:36] don't know if how much time we don't
[40:39] know it was it that Moses himself
[40:41] evidently had had made a petition unto
[40:44] the Lord of
[40:45] what do i do you know the the the the
[40:47] spirit of prophecy it's truckin but then
[40:49] he looked at the situation and notice
[40:51] you know God takes Moses to this place
[40:55] that Moses would actually have
[40:57] confidence in the anointing that was
[41:00] upon his life because God had already
[41:02] commissioned him and the Commission
[41:04] could not change and brother Bram takes
[41:07] us to this in the message why Christ
[41:08] speak that he speaks in July of 63 and
[41:11] he said what God was bringing Moses back
[41:14] to is to have confidence in the
[41:17] anointing that is upon your life and
[41:19] brother brems says that's where we need
[41:21] to reside is to have confidence on the
[41:24] anointing that God has placed in our
[41:26] life and brother Graham places it like
[41:28] this and I don't want to dwell so much
[41:29] upon this but he says when Moses was
[41:31] down in Egypt God would tell Moses go do
[41:34] this and Moses went and did it he said
[41:37] then God would say do this Moses went
[41:39] and did it do this Moses went and did it
[41:41] so it was so much to where God was
[41:43] telling me do this he would do that do
[41:44] this he would do that but here it came
[41:46] to a time for Moses to stand upon the
[41:49] thority of the anointing that God had
[41:51] placed in his life and God was not
[41:53] telling him Oh Moses here's the Red Sea
[41:56] and here's everything that's taking
[41:57] place and and this is what I want you to
[41:59] do he's come to an obstacle and God said
[42:02] I'm not gonna pull you through a pipe
[42:03] but you're gonna make a decision based
[42:05] on this and you're going to make it
[42:07] based on the anointing that's in your
[42:09] life there is an obstacle in your way
[42:11] and I why are you crying unto me speak
[42:16] that the people go forward and I believe
[42:18] that that's exactly where the Spirit of
[42:20] God brings us to in this hour as the
[42:22] sons and daughters of God is to have
[42:24] confidence in the anointing of the Holy
[42:27] Spirit the word that is broke up on our
[42:29] lives and to see that this prophetic
[42:32] utterance that it went forth and how
[42:34] that the Red Sea itself was parted this
[42:37] was an experience for the children of
[42:39] Israel of how that they in Moses would
[42:42] would be led by the Spirit of God to
[42:43] speak and how that you know you find
[42:46] that after Moses had spoke the wind
[42:48] begin to come through and you know it's
[42:50] just like that you know brother brems
[42:52] said when you want the Holy Ghost in
[42:54] your meetings you preach the word
[42:56] and you watch how the holy spirit will
[42:58] come right behind the word it's just
[43:00] like that in Ezekiel 37 when they looked
[43:02] upon the dry bones and said son of man
[43:05] can these dry bones live again and then
[43:07] it says prophesize son of man and has
[43:10] the word itself begin to come forth
[43:13] there was a wind a living reality that
[43:16] come right behind the word to bring to
[43:19] past what was spoken so here the people
[43:22] of God are crossing right through where
[43:25] the word has made a way where there was
[43:29] no way at that time but God remember
[43:32] he's displaying his power to Israel in
[43:35] this time God is making this as a
[43:38] memorial this is an experience that God
[43:40] wants Israel to draw upon you you
[43:43] realize within your life in my life
[43:45] there are experiences that you and I go
[43:48] through that you know sometimes you go
[43:50] to tell somebody else and and it's a
[43:52] supernatural reality around it but to
[43:55] the other person they can rejoice in it
[43:57] but it doesn't have the depth of meaning
[44:00] to them me or you as it would to you
[44:02] personally but you see why that is
[44:04] that's because it is for you personally
[44:07] there will be things come again in your
[44:09] life and you will actually have to draw
[44:12] upon the experience that God has brought
[44:15] you through that's why everything within
[44:17] our lives is so unique it's God working
[44:19] so personally with us like he did with
[44:22] Israel so when situations arise that
[44:25] would be similar to this you are able to
[44:28] draw by the Spirit of God upon
[44:31] remembrances of things that God himself
[44:33] has already done and what does it do it
[44:36] brings faith when you're looking at the
[44:38] situation we saw that in David's life
[44:40] with the line with the bear and then he
[44:42] drew upon that when he actually was
[44:44] facing Goliath - the look at this of how
[44:47] that you know they're walking now in the
[44:49] midst of this time and I want to break
[44:51] in a little more into this song in
[44:53] Exodus 15 if we could continue reading
[44:56] here a little bit in verse 4 notice this
[44:59] song as it would be as it would be sung
[45:02] pharaoh's chariots and his hosts hath he
[45:05] cast into the sea
[45:06] his chosen captains also
[45:09] drowned in the Red Sea the depths have
[45:12] covered them they sank into the bottom
[45:15] as a stone thy right hand O Lord is
[45:18] become glorious in power by right hand o
[45:22] lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy
[45:25] remember now Moses is singing unto the
[45:28] Lord he is actually singing back to the
[45:32] Lord that which he himself has witnessed
[45:34] the Lord do and I find it in striking of
[45:37] how that this song of how that it is
[45:40] struck within this moment and all of
[45:43] these details that would be laying
[45:45] within here
[45:46] that Moses would find you know maybe we
[45:48] could look over the wholeness of this of
[45:50] this particular event and say man it's
[45:53] just God's redemptive power and it
[45:55] indeed is God's redemptive power you
[45:58] know brother BAM tells us regarding this
[45:59] chapter he said God had already redeemed
[46:02] him by blood he said but God wanted to
[46:04] make known to Israel that redemption is
[46:07] not just my blood but redemption comes
[46:09] with power and that redemption is by a
[46:12] person so the Lord is a man of war the
[46:15] Lord is his name remember God is causing
[46:18] his name to be made known in this time
[46:20] now remember what his name is
[46:22] his name is I am that I am this name as
[46:25] he revealed himself to Moses this will
[46:28] be a memorial through all generations
[46:29] and God's name is actually being made
[46:33] manifest in this time upon the very army
[46:36] of Pharaoh now think about it in your
[46:39] life in my life the name of the Lord
[46:41] Jesus Christ is actually it's not torn
[46:44] down by sinners but his reputation is
[46:47] actually made in the presence of sinners
[46:49] where he would change and transform our
[46:52] lives whereby the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:55] Christ not just you and I say well yeah
[46:57] I'm a Christian but remember it was not
[47:00] them in the book of Acts that called
[47:02] themselves Christians but it was the
[47:04] life that was so pre-eminently
[47:06] identified the name of Jesus Christ was
[47:09] so on display in their life actions not
[47:12] just things they said but their life to
[47:14] where they first called them Christians
[47:17] they're there in Antioch they didn't go
[47:19] around saying it of themselves but it
[47:21] was and I did
[47:22] of that life and after all we know that
[47:26] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[47:28] more than just having a name but it's to
[47:30] be actually be identified in that name
[47:33] by having the same life that was within
[47:35] the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:38] is that right
[47:39] the Bible says in the Book of Isaiah
[47:41] there would be seven women that would
[47:42] take hold upon one man and say give us
[47:45] your name but we'll eat our own bread
[47:46] you just give us your name so we can
[47:49] take away our reproach remember jesus
[47:51] also said in the book of matthew there
[47:54] would be many that will come to me on
[47:55] that day and they'll say haven't we cast
[47:57] out devils in thy name done many
[47:59] wonderful things in thy name but the
[48:01] reality is they were just merely using
[48:04] his name they were not identified in his
[48:08] name by his name you see it's like
[48:10] forgery on a cheque they really did not
[48:14] have the substance of the life within
[48:16] them but yet they were using the name of
[48:19] the Lord Jesus Christ for the sick to be
[48:22] healed devils to be cast out but yet
[48:24] they were not actually identified in
[48:27] that name by a ceremony where they have
[48:30] become one with the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:32] but you see how that here in the midst
[48:35] of this exodus of this song that Moses
[48:38] would break out and he begins to go
[48:40] further and say in verse seven in the
[48:42] greatness of thine excellency thou has
[48:45] overthrown them that rose up against
[48:48] thee thou sent us forth thy wrath which
[48:51] consumed them as stubble and with the
[48:54] blast of thy nostrils the waters were
[48:58] gathered together have you noticed
[48:59] within this reading it makes it as
[49:01] though God is a man but yet God is a
[49:04] spirit you'll notice it'll talk about
[49:06] God's right hand it'll speak about
[49:08] nostrils it'll speak about this right
[49:10] God Himself coming down and becoming so
[49:13] personal among his people what is it
[49:15] it's God's presence the Living God
[49:19] manifesting his power among his people
[49:22] now the think of this of how it would go
[49:24] on and say with the blast of my nostrils
[49:27] the waters were gathered together the
[49:29] flood stood upright as a heat and the
[49:31] depths were congealed in the heart of
[49:33] the sea the enemies
[49:36] I will pursue I will overtake I will
[49:39] divide the spoil now you see you look at
[49:42] this within the midst of it in a song
[49:44] that how that Moses would be permitted
[49:47] by inspiration to actually gather what
[49:50] was the heart behind Pharaoh and coming
[49:53] after them then I'll not be a marvel to
[49:55] us the Bible even when you think of this
[49:57] in different hymns and songs that's been
[50:00] written remember I would not be denied
[50:02] old Satan said My Lord was gone and
[50:05] would not hear my prayer but praise the
[50:07] Lord the work is done and Christ our
[50:10] Lord is here you see it reveals this
[50:13] working of Satan's whole undermining his
[50:16] whole scheme it's actually now been an
[50:18] uncovering and taking over of what it is
[50:21] that he's longed to do it was my lust
[50:24] shall be satisfied upon them I will draw
[50:27] my sword my hand shall destroy them how
[50:31] did it blow with I wind the sea covered
[50:34] them they sank as lead in the mighty
[50:38] waters oh my verse 11 notice how then
[50:42] Moses keeps singing here who is like
[50:45] unto thee o lord among the gods who is
[50:48] like thee glorious in holiness fearful
[50:51] in praises doing wonders thou stretches
[50:55] out by hand the earth swallowed them
[50:58] thou in thy mercy has led forth the
[51:01] people which thou has redeemed thou has
[51:03] guided them in by strength unto thy holy
[51:06] habitation now watch this here watch how
[51:09] it starts to break over from a present
[51:12] experience into the prophetic now the
[51:15] song itself actually begins to move into
[51:18] the prophecy of when Israel will
[51:21] actually come into position now watch
[51:24] this here the people shall hear and be
[51:27] afraid sorrows shall take hold on the
[51:30] inhabitants of Palestine then the dukes
[51:33] of Edom shall be amazed the mighty men
[51:35] of Moab trembling shall take hold upon
[51:37] them all the inhabitants of Canaan shall
[51:40] melt away fear and dread shall fall upon
[51:43] them by the greatness of dying
[51:46] they shall be as a stone till thy people
[51:49] pass over O Lord till the people pass
[51:52] over which thou hast purchased thou
[51:56] shalt bring them in and plant them in
[51:58] the mountain of thine inheritance in the
[52:01] place o Lord which thou has made for
[52:04] thee to dwell in in the sanctuary O Lord
[52:06] which thy hands have established the
[52:09] Lord shall reign forever and ever for
[52:11] the horse of Pharaoh went in with his
[52:14] chariots and with his horsemen into the
[52:17] sea and the Lord brought again the
[52:19] waters of the sea upon them but the
[52:21] children of Israel went on dry land in
[52:23] the midst of the sea this was indeed a
[52:28] song being sung it was a song that was
[52:33] being sung unto the Lord you think of
[52:36] how that God would you know have his
[52:39] name to be made known when you read
[52:42] these verses that we just read here this
[52:44] event that would take place here when
[52:48] God would display his power it would
[52:50] actually send tremors of fear through
[52:53] the dukes of e9 edom it would actually
[52:56] cause those in Canaan and those who were
[52:58] there holding places it would cause them
[53:01] to tremble remember when they came to
[53:03] Rahab she said at that time our hearts
[53:06] did melt within us that remain no
[53:09] courage anymore when the people here had
[53:12] heard how the Lord hath opened up the
[53:15] rods the Red Sea and caused you to go on
[53:17] dry ground you remember that it had
[53:19] already reached there now think about
[53:21] this when you look at God's name the
[53:24] reputation because after all God had
[53:27] told them in the book of Deuteronomy
[53:28] that you shall be the name of the Lord
[53:31] shall be seen upon you that you are
[53:34] called by the name of the Lord
[53:36] Oh what a blessed thing it is to be
[53:38] identified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:41] Christ what a blessing and reality it is
[53:43] to be identified in that name having the
[53:46] life that name flowing through you and
[53:49] you and I what a reality that it moves
[53:51] within our hearts now to think of this
[53:54] you know when Moses you know would start
[53:56] in here in this time you know
[53:58] he moves upon the bank and to think
[54:00] about it how brother branham would place
[54:02] it within this measure here he said you
[54:05] know when Moses and then when they came
[54:07] out they had walked across that of you
[54:09] know of the Red Sea and when they came
[54:12] out of it you know he said it's like the
[54:14] spirit itself and maybe pulled back but
[54:16] then Moses and them got to looking
[54:19] around and they begin to see what had
[54:21] taken place and what God had done and
[54:25] when they begin to look this wants you
[54:26] to catch they begin to look at what God
[54:29] had done for them and there when they
[54:33] begin to see that brother Brent said
[54:35] they just got excited he said they they
[54:37] just got so excited he said that Moses
[54:40] himself got in the spirit and begin to
[54:43] raise his hands and worship so when you
[54:46] look at it Moses his worship the song
[54:49] that is actually being sung unto the
[54:52] Lord by Moses and the rest of Israel is
[54:55] because of an experience that they
[54:57] themselves has just they they've just
[55:00] come through this experience and they're
[55:02] standing on the other side I mean the
[55:04] inspiration has struck them and packed
[55:07] them away you see the Bible goes on to
[55:09] tell us here in the next few verses of
[55:11] how that Miriam that Miriam herself she
[55:14] began to rejoice you see the Bible opens
[55:17] up with Moses there in the scripture and
[55:19] says how the children of Israel were
[55:21] rejoicing the minute breaks on down and
[55:23] tells us how that Miriam herself began
[55:26] to take up timbrels tambourines and she
[55:28] begin to move and as she moved all the
[55:31] rest of the daughters followed suit
[55:33] brother brems told us like this he said
[55:35] what it was he said it was like atoms
[55:37] that had just began to move from one to
[55:40] another and the Spirit of God was moving
[55:43] right there in that service and it had
[55:45] begin to just move from one to another
[55:47] as Moses and them were singing in the
[55:50] spirit Oh to think of this and what this
[55:52] really types that one day oh my when the
[55:54] resurrection will come that of them when
[55:57] you look at the elect of God there'll be
[55:59] Miriam's that are raised up and they
[56:01] will reach over and grab this one and
[56:03] reach over and grab this one and reach
[56:05] over and grab this one and you talking
[56:07] about a time of rejoicing you've never
[56:10] seen such a time of rejoicing no wonder
[56:13] the prophet could say you heard me sing
[56:15] amazing grace here wait till you hear me
[56:17] sing it over there all glory be to God
[56:25] here they are rejoicing there are
[56:28] witnessing what God has done and Moses
[56:31] got in the spirit you know brother
[56:34] Branham brings it to us over and over he
[56:37] says you know that same Holy Ghost that
[56:40] was upon Moses is the same holy spirit
[56:42] that's in this building tonight
[56:45] he said no wonder when that Moses could
[56:47] sing a new song and sing in the spirit
[56:50] you know this song had never been sung
[56:52] before there was inspiration that
[56:56] dropped in that moment now I know for
[56:59] you and I their songs sometimes that
[57:00] will come back to us and will inspire us
[57:03] and that's true but this was a new song
[57:05] that was dealing with the experience and
[57:08] the way that the presence of the Lord
[57:10] was moving within that time and Moses
[57:13] could look and the rest of them could
[57:15] see what the dead Egyptians tell me why
[57:18] they shouldn't be happy tell me why they
[57:21] shouldn't be rejoicing you know that's
[57:23] just how it is for you and I when we
[57:24] come into the house of God we can sit
[57:27] here and sing songs by memory or we can
[57:29] enter into the presence of God and
[57:31] actually have a connection and
[57:33] experience with that now you know when
[57:36] you look at him and you think about it
[57:37] they were not just singing a song they
[57:39] were singing unto the Lord they were
[57:42] singing about an event where they could
[57:44] see dead Egyptians laying on the
[57:47] seashore how about you and I tonight
[57:49] where we can sing about things that God
[57:52] has doing in our life has done in our
[57:54] life to think about it when we sing of
[57:56] that song on a hill far away stood an
[57:58] old rugged cross we can still go back
[58:00] and think if it hadn't been for the Lord
[58:03] Jesus where would I be
[58:05] I tell you you go to thinking like that
[58:07] you'll find yourself entering right into
[58:09] worship when you begin to sing those
[58:11] songs and you begin to think like they
[58:14] did when they saw those Egyptians and
[58:17] brother Brent said when they saw those
[58:19] Egyptians then they got in the
[58:22] and begin to worship you see sometimes
[58:26] it matters what we're looking at you can
[58:28] come into the house of God you can look
[58:30] at it you can look at things you can be
[58:32] sitting right here and look at your
[58:34] problems you can look at your
[58:35] difficulties you can look around and
[58:37] maybe this is not right or that's not
[58:39] right the wrong court here or whatever
[58:41] more not the right temperature and you
[58:43] can allow the enemy to take away and
[58:46] bring you away from the warship that
[58:48] will prepare you for the words that come
[58:51] forth or you can set there and call him
[58:53] at it and say huh you're not getting my
[58:55] praise in my worship you are not going
[58:58] to get my mind you are not going to get
[59:00] me trapped on that no sir I am NOT
[59:02] falling for that I have come here
[59:04] tonight to worship the Lord I've come to
[59:07] hear from God and I choose to focus upon
[59:10] dead Egyptians I choose to focus on God
[59:15] in his healing power that God has
[59:17] delivered me no sir I am not focusing on
[59:21] the negative of my situation I'm
[59:22] focusing on the word that says he's my
[59:25] provider because he's provided for me
[59:28] all along oh my sometimes people think
[59:35] once they get to the house of God you've
[59:36] got it mate you've just entered the
[59:38] battle oh ma Moses begin to get in the
[59:45] spirit when he saw the dead Egyptians no
[59:50] brother Brandon you know he'll talk to
[59:51] you he'll bring this in many different
[59:52] ways when you think of even Elijah the
[59:55] spirit memory last room when he looked
[59:57] at Jehoshaphat
[59:58] Elisha was not in the right demeanour he
[1:00:00] was not in the right way for the spirit
[1:00:02] of prophecy to come upon his life
[1:00:04] brother Graham said there had to be some
[1:00:06] good old spiritual songs sung that would
[1:00:09] actually change the mood of the Prophet
[1:00:13] so that the Spirit of God could come on
[1:00:16] him oh my think how many times brother
[1:00:19] Graham said I was sitting back there in
[1:00:21] the office he said of all the interviews
[1:00:23] and he said every people come in and go
[1:00:25] and he says I was all torn up he said
[1:00:27] that I sat right back there he's sitting
[1:00:29] through the song service he said oh my
[1:00:32] how you were singing
[1:00:33] said it ministered to me to wear that I
[1:00:35] could come and stand here and preach you
[1:00:40] see there's an order there's an order
[1:00:42] God knows how to minister to you and I
[1:00:45] now when I look at this you know how
[1:00:48] they came to the other side but I said
[1:00:51] when they got their feet on the other
[1:00:52] side there was inspiration that had had
[1:00:55] struck Moses in that hour you know it
[1:00:58] was that of God's sovereign power this
[1:01:00] this song was not a song about anything
[1:01:03] that they had done it was a song about
[1:01:06] what the Lord had just done and what he
[1:01:10] did he will also do know the words he
[1:01:13] brought us through the Red Sea by his
[1:01:16] fire by his power he will also by that
[1:01:19] same power bring us into the land Omaha
[1:01:23] no wonder you and I could sing oh lord
[1:01:26] send the power just now because we
[1:01:29] recognize it's that same power that
[1:01:31] we're living off of that we're watering
[1:01:34] right now that same Holy Ghost will pack
[1:01:37] us into the presence of our bridegroom
[1:01:40] it's the same power of God the same
[1:01:43] quickening power of God that's residing
[1:01:46] in our soul by the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:49] Ghost that will literally pack us across
[1:01:52] that Great Divide of time into eternity
[1:01:55] where our bodies will be changed God's
[1:02:00] presence I want you to think of this
[1:02:02] here in this song inspiration had
[1:02:05] dropped spontaneously this was not
[1:02:09] something that they could have worked up
[1:02:12] this was not a work up this was not some
[1:02:16] this was a rejoicing this was a
[1:02:20] rejoicing there was no mistaking here
[1:02:22] there was this respondent Aeneas worship
[1:02:26] inspiration had dropped because of the
[1:02:29] present circumstances you're talking
[1:02:32] about a song that they had in the midst
[1:02:35] of that time now think about this this
[1:02:37] is a song that God it's not just a song
[1:02:40] that you know is just gonna be sung one
[1:02:43] time but this is a
[1:02:45] some that God is gonna want Israel to
[1:02:47] remember time and time again because
[1:02:51] they're going to come up against some
[1:02:52] very hard times they're going to come
[1:02:55] into some situations that the Red Sea
[1:02:57] it's just like you and I we come through
[1:02:59] a test or trial and then the next test
[1:03:01] or trial comes we'll think dear Lord
[1:03:03] this tester trout ain't nothing like the
[1:03:05] rest of them Lord I'll take the one that
[1:03:06] I had before and in reality we felt the
[1:03:09] same way before as we do now you know
[1:03:11] what it comes down to the weakness and
[1:03:13] frailty of our humanity is displayed in
[1:03:16] that we can do nothing in ourselves so
[1:03:22] here is Moses in the midst of this time
[1:03:25] inspiration drops down and you know he
[1:03:28] begins to worship and the rest of Israel
[1:03:30] begins to worship and it is God
[1:03:32] declaring his power now listen to me
[1:03:35] it's God declaring his power and God
[1:03:38] declaring that I am present among you
[1:03:44] you know when you look at this Wysong it
[1:03:49] didn't say that Moses began to preach I
[1:03:51] can't imagine he felt like preaching no
[1:03:57] doubt he felt like it but you see he did
[1:04:00] in one way because it was there's one
[1:04:03] way that gospel can also go forth and
[1:04:06] song we'll get to it here in a moment
[1:04:08] you see he began to sing under
[1:04:11] inspiration how the Holy Spirit was
[1:04:13] opening in that time and you know how it
[1:04:15] is that when words are set to a melody
[1:04:20] somebody can begin to hum that melody
[1:04:23] and all they have to do is start humming
[1:04:26] that and you can start finishing words
[1:04:29] it'll trigger something that you've
[1:04:31] forgot about I'll think about it here I
[1:04:34] was thinking about it the other day I
[1:04:36] was standing in an office a store or
[1:04:38] restaurant and I was standing there and
[1:04:40] you know as I was standing there then
[1:04:42] all of a sudden you know that the song
[1:04:44] itself that was playing it began to
[1:04:46] stand out to me and as it was standing
[1:04:48] out to me I remembered that song as far
[1:04:51] as in the words it was a worldly song I
[1:04:53] remembered the words of it but what it
[1:04:55] is is that as that song was being played
[1:04:58] I was a ten year old boy back on the
[1:05:00] school bus in the country again 33 years
[1:05:03] I had been transported back to that
[1:05:06] moment of being a little boy has ten
[1:05:09] years old nine years old on the school
[1:05:11] bus and you know how many times where
[1:05:12] where I rode the school bus we were on
[1:05:14] it for an hour an hour to school and an
[1:05:17] hour home from school so you know you
[1:05:19] heard the music you heard all sorts of
[1:05:21] things that you know probably my parents
[1:05:23] wouldn't have wanted me to hear but you
[1:05:24] hear those things and all the melodies
[1:05:26] but to think of that of how that God
[1:05:29] himself that's just Satan's way of using
[1:05:31] it but we realized that you know within
[1:05:34] music itself the devil is not the
[1:05:36] originator of anything remember he is
[1:05:40] just a pervert er of what is righteous
[1:05:43] you think about it in the days of Daniel
[1:05:46] when Daniel and the Hebrew children were
[1:05:48] in the time of Babylon how were they
[1:05:50] called to worship that image it was by
[1:05:53] music wasn't it it was by music when the
[1:05:56] soul trees and all those things would go
[1:05:57] forth then the rest of Babylon would
[1:06:00] actually know at that time it's time to
[1:06:03] go and worship it was a music that was
[1:06:06] taking place within that hour now think
[1:06:08] of it why is it that Daniel and the rest
[1:06:11] of the Hebrew children they did not go
[1:06:13] because they were believers it didn't
[1:06:15] matter if they were in Babylon they were
[1:06:17] still believers and what it is Daniel
[1:06:19] and the rest of them had discernment to
[1:06:21] know that song don't sound right that
[1:06:24] song don't have the right lyrics to it
[1:06:26] that song just don't seem to have the
[1:06:29] right beat to it so they were not drawn
[1:06:32] in worship you see what they had was not
[1:06:34] a code of what are acceptable hymns by
[1:06:38] that of Daniel and the Hebrew no it was
[1:06:40] not that they were not going to start
[1:06:42] some sort of a denomination organization
[1:06:44] they didn't need their own hymnal they
[1:06:47] had the same God who had inspired one of
[1:06:50] the prophets David and by that same
[1:06:52] inspiration there would be a discernment
[1:06:54] of a holy spirit to know what songs are
[1:06:57] appropriate and what songs are not
[1:07:00] appropriate well thank God for the Holy
[1:07:03] Ghost so when we look at this here the
[1:07:07] you know why would God set this to be a
[1:07:10] song because God would want this to be
[1:07:13] recalled and it to be a song that would
[1:07:16] be sung over and over now you know when
[1:07:18] they get to looking at a lot of this
[1:07:20] year what astounds me and some of the
[1:07:22] medical professionals here would would
[1:07:24] know this and understand it is that they
[1:07:26] find where there are people who actually
[1:07:28] have memory loss that when they have
[1:07:31] memory loss sometimes short term and
[1:07:32] what-have-you they they're not able to
[1:07:34] remember certain things but if they can
[1:07:36] find you know the time period maybe when
[1:07:38] that person was a teenager then they can
[1:07:40] find when they were in their 20s and so
[1:07:42] forth and then they look for songs of
[1:07:45] during that time now they would have to
[1:07:46] ask him where they serve in the Lord at
[1:07:48] the time or whatever more and they would
[1:07:49] actually begin to play certain songs
[1:07:52] they find that there would be a trigger
[1:07:55] of the memory and it would actually
[1:07:57] begin to stir up the memories within
[1:08:00] those people that had absolutely lost
[1:08:03] their short-term memory well that all
[1:08:06] not be no Marvel to you and I God does
[1:08:09] that time and time again for you and I
[1:08:11] he comes and he plays a song he plays
[1:08:15] the music he comes in and begins to move
[1:08:17] upon our life to do what calls us to
[1:08:20] remember who we are you see when you
[1:08:25] look at it even among dementia patients
[1:08:27] and Alzheimer's patients when I was
[1:08:29] reading many of their articles just
[1:08:31] looking at those things they find that
[1:08:33] even when that of dimension better then
[1:08:36] of Alzheimer's which we know is the
[1:08:37] progressed advanced of that that even
[1:08:40] when were among those patients and
[1:08:42] things when they themselves have come to
[1:08:44] a place no longer talking but they have
[1:08:47] found you play music you find the actual
[1:08:50] songs that they would like and when they
[1:08:53] themselves have come to a place they're
[1:08:55] no longer talking but yet you let
[1:08:57] certain music be played and they'll be
[1:08:59] able to sing that song word for word
[1:09:02] what is it it's something about music
[1:09:06] that actually will reach down and bring
[1:09:09] forth words when they can't even
[1:09:11] remember their name you with me so to
[1:09:14] look at this at how that even the
[1:09:16] therapists have said that there are
[1:09:18] those who were
[1:09:19] through therapy and when they found out
[1:09:21] this patient likes certain songs like
[1:09:24] the family members had told him and so
[1:09:26] forth they in order to get that patient
[1:09:28] to actually stay in therapy instead of
[1:09:31] just walking a few steps and saying I'm
[1:09:33] tired they actually found certain songs
[1:09:36] and they would sing those songs and the
[1:09:38] patient would sing the songs back and
[1:09:41] what they found is that patient would
[1:09:43] actually walk a lot further or aren't
[1:09:45] you glad that without the song you and I
[1:09:48] would only be taking a few steps but
[1:09:51] because of the song of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:53] and God knows how that may bring that
[1:09:55] song right down our way he keeps us
[1:09:58] walking right instead onward Christian
[1:10:01] soldiers marching as to war I know the
[1:10:04] devil's gotta stop but God is remembered
[1:10:07] the author and the origin safeand don't
[1:10:10] have nothing on God well repeater God
[1:10:15] look at this so think about it you and I
[1:10:17] what about you and I you and I were in a
[1:10:20] place of some bad amnesia come on
[1:10:24] somebody we were in a situation of bad
[1:10:26] amnesia and we needed a song to bring us
[1:10:30] back to reality it couldn't just be any
[1:10:33] old song it had to be a new song that
[1:10:35] was sung that would actually joked that
[1:10:38] of our memory to bring us back to I'm a
[1:10:41] son of God I'm a daughter of God bring
[1:10:44] us back to that reality so God uses
[1:10:46] music now he don't use music maybe in
[1:10:49] the way that you know as we're looking
[1:10:50] at it tonight yet he does but God
[1:10:52] remember this entire book is one great
[1:10:55] music sheet the notes that are wrote
[1:10:58] upon the straight music sheet are
[1:11:00] actually in the lives of his believing
[1:11:03] children and so God Himself being the
[1:11:06] great composer he himself knows exactly
[1:11:10] where every note is at and he knows how
[1:11:13] to positionally place every note when an
[1:11:15] eighth note wants to run and follow
[1:11:17] after a quarter note note note you stay
[1:11:19] right here
[1:11:20] 16th I need you right here 32nd I need
[1:11:22] you right there now look at our lives
[1:11:24] our lives our arrangement of different
[1:11:26] notes but yet when it's brought under
[1:11:29] the great harmony
[1:11:30] orchestration of the great composer and
[1:11:33] director of the Holy Ghost it begins to
[1:11:36] bring out a symphonic sound that will
[1:11:38] reflect the melody that was actually
[1:11:41] contained and tracked here in this old
[1:11:43] violin this music sheet so I will sing
[1:11:48] unto the Lord
[1:11:49] once I've been released I'll sing unto
[1:11:52] the Lord to think of this song this song
[1:11:58] of the sea' as it's called in the Book
[1:12:02] of Revelations is called the song of
[1:12:04] Moses Israel themselves you know it
[1:12:08] would speak prophetically and hound that
[1:12:11] this melody itself would strike you know
[1:12:13] even God would tell Moses in Deuteronomy
[1:12:15] 32 that he would want Moses to write
[1:12:18] down that doubt of the curse things that
[1:12:21] of the blessings and he wanted it to be
[1:12:23] put to a song and Moses was told in
[1:12:26] Deuteronomy 31 and 32 teach this song to
[1:12:30] the people so when we think about this
[1:12:33] here you know music it has the ability
[1:12:35] to transport us different places home I
[1:12:41] think of how that David would say this
[1:12:43] in Psalms 37 verse 6 he said for this
[1:12:47] shall everyone that is godly pray unto
[1:12:50] thee in a time when thou may us be found
[1:12:53] surely in the floods of Great Waters
[1:12:55] they shall not come nigh unto him thou
[1:12:59] art my hiding place thou shalt preserve
[1:13:01] me from trouble
[1:13:02] thou shall compass me about with songs
[1:13:06] of deliverance this is David's rest
[1:13:12] he knows trouble is coming he knows the
[1:13:17] trials that will come his way great
[1:13:20] pearl but yet this is the promise
[1:13:22] thou shalt compass me round about with
[1:13:26] songs of deliverance
[1:13:27] how would he compass him about with
[1:13:29] songs of deliverance it would be with
[1:13:31] songs that David would know and be able
[1:13:34] to actually draw strength from those
[1:13:37] songs in the midst of the time when he's
[1:13:40] being tried he would actually
[1:13:42] draw strength from deliverance that's
[1:13:46] how you and I draw strength because we
[1:13:50] draw strength from there's deliverance
[1:13:52] he is my deliverer I don't want no
[1:13:56] singing of a sad song I wonder when I'm
[1:13:58] going through trouble I want that song
[1:14:00] and melody to be he's my deliverer he is
[1:14:04] my strength he is my song all glory so
[1:14:10] David had his own little special created
[1:14:13] playlist except he didn't create the
[1:14:16] playlist God did glory be to God it was
[1:14:20] a playlist that was specially this was a
[1:14:22] an album you know that was dedicated to
[1:14:25] times of deliverance oh boy oh ma think
[1:14:30] of this here you know when you look at
[1:14:32] it it matters where you and I are as to
[1:14:36] what we're singing it matters where we
[1:14:39] are just think of that for a moment it
[1:14:40] matters where we are when we're singing
[1:14:45] now think of this here in Psalms 37
[1:14:49] David would say like this this is
[1:14:51] prophetic of the Exile to Babylon that
[1:14:53] would come by the rivers of Babylon
[1:14:56] there we sat down yea we wept when we
[1:14:59] remembered Zion we hanged our harps upon
[1:15:02] the Willows in the midst thereof for
[1:15:05] there they carried us away captive
[1:15:08] required of us a song and they that
[1:15:13] wasted us required of us mirth saying
[1:15:16] sing us one of the songs of Zion how
[1:15:22] shall we sing the Lord's song in a
[1:15:26] strange land
[1:15:29] if I'll forget thee O Jerusalem let my
[1:15:33] right hand forget her cunning if I do
[1:15:36] not remember thee let my tongue cleave
[1:15:38] to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not
[1:15:42] Jerusalem above my chief joy notice
[1:15:48] scoffers mockers that have carried him
[1:15:52] away they're not asking them as though
[1:15:55] but the song
[1:15:56] have a meaning to them they are just
[1:15:58] simply in a way of mocking them sing us
[1:16:01] one of the songs of Zion
[1:16:03] come on be mirth be happy but you see
[1:16:06] how they look in this time they regard
[1:16:10] all help you here min and I they regard
[1:16:12] these songs of Zion as the song of the
[1:16:15] Lord
[1:16:16] they took this collection this is the
[1:16:19] song of the Lord and we will not sing
[1:16:22] this to mockery this is a song that is
[1:16:26] to be sung to the Lord they were not
[1:16:30] going to obey that the songs of Zion to
[1:16:33] be sung but once they would get back
[1:16:35] home to the place of worship ah this is
[1:16:40] the place where the songs of Zion are to
[1:16:43] be sung you see it matters where you're
[1:16:46] singing them you take for example a
[1:16:48] person maybe this will help make it more
[1:16:49] plain you take for example a person that
[1:16:52] can sing amazing grace
[1:16:54] now maybe here their life they've just
[1:16:56] surrendered their life to the Lord and
[1:16:57] maybe here their life is still filled
[1:16:59] with all sorts of things in their life
[1:17:01] but they have received him as their
[1:17:04] Savior the same desires and things are
[1:17:06] still prevalent within their life if
[1:17:08] they were smoker they're still smoking
[1:17:10] drinking still drinking and whatever
[1:17:11] more but yet within their heart they
[1:17:14] have looked at it and said I repent of
[1:17:16] my sins I receive you Lord God I want
[1:17:19] you to be my Lord and Savior they
[1:17:21] experienced a redemptive work by the
[1:17:24] measure of the holy spirit releasing
[1:17:26] them and they feel the burden lift off
[1:17:29] of their shoulders now you ask them to
[1:17:31] sing Amazing Race Hey
[1:17:33] they'll sing amazing grace a lot
[1:17:34] different before that took place in
[1:17:36] their life but then you wait until after
[1:17:39] in their life that their life themselves
[1:17:41] the heart itself has been emptied out
[1:17:43] it's been scoured out they made they
[1:17:46] pass through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:48] then they'll sing amazing grace a little
[1:17:50] different than they did before then they
[1:17:53] keep on walking with the Lord and now
[1:17:55] they'll sing that same song Amazing
[1:17:58] Grace but they'll sing it being filled
[1:18:00] with with the supreme grace of God the
[1:18:02] Holy Ghost and they'll sing it brother
[1:18:04] different than they ever sung it before
[1:18:06] what changed was a
[1:18:08] a song that changed know was that the
[1:18:10] lyrics had changed no was it the music
[1:18:12] no what is it it's where the person is
[1:18:15] dwelling at that matters are you with me
[1:18:19] there's many that could sing amazing
[1:18:21] grace lord have mercy Elvis Presley
[1:18:24] could sing amazing grace like nobody's
[1:18:26] business he would sing it tears would
[1:18:28] come to the eyes so when we look at that
[1:18:30] we could say well I'm not going to sing
[1:18:32] amazing grace why not it was not the
[1:18:34] devil that inspired that song it was the
[1:18:36] Holy Ghost that inspired that song it's
[1:18:39] something that has a meaning to our
[1:18:41] lives are you with me it matters where
[1:18:45] you're at you with me one of the songs
[1:18:49] we just sung here tonight he is here
[1:18:50] hallelujah he is here a man that was
[1:18:55] written out there by a writer Curt le it
[1:18:58] was written out there but when you look
[1:19:01] at it now think of it now when you look
[1:19:04] at those things of where that was buddy
[1:19:06] there was truth that is within that song
[1:19:09] that actually identifies the presence of
[1:19:12] the Lord among us I'll tell you right
[1:19:14] now Kurt Kali might have been the writer
[1:19:16] of it as far as the instrument that the
[1:19:18] Holy Spirit would have used to pin it
[1:19:20] but brother I'm telling you right now
[1:19:21] you cannot sing that song
[1:19:24] unless you're behind the veil I'm
[1:19:25] talking about in a real reality they
[1:19:27] could sing in on any home come and they
[1:19:29] want to sing it on but when it's
[1:19:31] somebody behind the veil brother it
[1:19:32] matters where you are where you are will
[1:19:35] have a difference on that song you take
[1:19:37] like the song of the lighthouse oh my
[1:19:39] the Goodman's would sing that song but
[1:19:41] brother I'm telling you you take it
[1:19:43] about a redeemed child of God that's
[1:19:45] passed beyond you know that the curtain
[1:19:47] there and into the veil where the glory
[1:19:49] of God never fails and the advancement
[1:19:51] of the gospel now I'm not taking
[1:19:53] anything away of where they were before
[1:19:55] you understand that but you recognize
[1:19:58] there's an understanding that's a
[1:20:00] greater understanding today when we sing
[1:20:02] that song of the lighthouse it's not the
[1:20:05] lyrics that have advanced but it's a
[1:20:08] holy goes that has advanced us and when
[1:20:10] we sing that soul we sing it with
[1:20:13] greater understand
[1:20:15] Oh glory glory glory you see is because
[1:20:22] of where we are located how many know
[1:20:30] that the song one of them may know how I
[1:20:34] got to about my heart here the past few
[1:20:36] weeks look they have studied these
[1:20:37] things and I got to looking at that song
[1:20:39] they know what song one of them now if I
[1:20:42] were to ask you one of them what would
[1:20:44] you identify that with I mean if there
[1:20:46] was an organization or a name of a
[1:20:47] people you would say Pentecostals right
[1:20:50] brother branham himself when he would
[1:20:52] sing it going down the street there in
[1:20:55] Memphis brother em said I was all tied
[1:20:57] up you know he said I was so nervous
[1:20:59] from everything that had taken place he
[1:21:01] said so I started singing the song one
[1:21:03] of them he said I was trying to get my
[1:21:05] mind fixed on that song he said you know
[1:21:07] that Pentecostals song uuugh
[1:21:09] Pentecostals he said that sing one of
[1:21:11] them do you realize that song was not
[1:21:13] even wrote by Pentecostal that song was
[1:21:18] wrote before Azusa Street ever came it
[1:21:21] was wrote by a man who was a Baptist
[1:21:24] Methodist and then he retired out as
[1:21:27] that of a pastor of a Church of Nazarene
[1:21:31] so my question is when I look at that
[1:21:35] song who gave him the inspiration the
[1:21:39] Holy Ghost
[1:21:40] do we not sing it because he's of the
[1:21:42] Church of the Nazarene or do we
[1:21:44] recognize oh this man might have his
[1:21:47] name on it but this has the copyright of
[1:21:50] the Holy Ghost all over it
[1:21:51] I'm one of them I've one of them you see
[1:21:53] what it is
[1:21:54] it's not that we need to create our own
[1:21:56] hymnals brother we're not about
[1:21:58] denominationalism well we need is the
[1:22:01] discernment of the Holy Ghost and to use
[1:22:04] the filter of the word to filter the
[1:22:06] sounds and the messages that are coming
[1:22:10] come on somebody Amen we need to have
[1:22:14] confidence in the Holy Ghost when I look
[1:22:18] at this and I think about it within
[1:22:20] Israel my about a year ago and I went
[1:22:23] looking it up again because I remember
[1:22:25] some one of the brothers they're some of
[1:22:26] the pastor's have sent me this song
[1:22:28] of a group of young men that had some of
[1:22:31] them had come from South Africa someone
[1:22:32] had come from different places
[1:22:33] throughout the world and here they were
[1:22:35] they were singing in Jerusalem there
[1:22:37] looking over the mountains and they sang
[1:22:39] these words we've come home we've come
[1:22:43] home Nevermore to Rome after 2,000 years
[1:22:51] we've come home but I'm telling you that
[1:22:55] morning when I opened that up and that
[1:22:58] had been sin I tell you could just sense
[1:23:00] the presence of God just move right off
[1:23:02] of that when I begin to elicit that I
[1:23:04] said praise God
[1:23:06] very joycie think of how the Spirit of
[1:23:08] God is preparing them getting them in
[1:23:11] position to receive the two witnesses
[1:23:14] brother what about you and I it was
[1:23:16] promised that the bride would come back
[1:23:18] he would come back to the original glory
[1:23:21] that seed that went in the ground that
[1:23:24] church that started on the day of
[1:23:25] Pentecost he would bring it back in his
[1:23:28] power and his glory I say tonight we've
[1:23:31] got a new song we have come back home we
[1:23:34] have come back home after 2,000 years
[1:23:37] never more to Rome we have come back
[1:23:40] home it's a song that has meaning to us
[1:23:49] think of calluses calluses is in the
[1:23:55] temple they are singing Psalms 22 they
[1:24:03] are singing the psalm that the Spirit of
[1:24:07] God would catch David up in and David
[1:24:11] would speak with prophetic utterance
[1:24:16] regarding the Messiah they had learned
[1:24:20] this song calluses and the rest of them
[1:24:23] they sung this song and they would sing
[1:24:26] it every certain day it's just like
[1:24:27] certain songs her son had to pass over
[1:24:30] certain songs are sung every morning
[1:24:32] certain song it's just a really a
[1:24:33] blessing when you study and look at it
[1:24:35] there are certain songs that are sung
[1:24:37] within that time that is a designated
[1:24:39] time of the
[1:24:40] Eastern and certain things that take
[1:24:42] place but you find Caiaphas is here he
[1:24:44] is singing this song I want you to think
[1:24:47] deep here he's singing this song out of
[1:24:49] tradition and he's missing what God is
[1:24:52] doing that's why we don't want to sing
[1:24:55] songs by tradition we don't want this
[1:24:58] message to be a song of tradition come
[1:25:02] on friends we don't need to put any
[1:25:04] filters on it though God has given us
[1:25:07] the filter he's given us the filter of
[1:25:10] the word the Holy Ghost
[1:25:12] we don't need man-made ideas and
[1:25:14] man-made Creed's and man-made double we
[1:25:17] don't need that we need the Lord just to
[1:25:21] lead us
[1:25:22] you see Caiaphas is here he was
[1:25:25] crucifying the very word that he was
[1:25:27] singing about now to think about this
[1:25:30] that didn't make Psalms 22 a bad song to
[1:25:33] sing hello somebody the word was being
[1:25:37] crucified and they were singing it and
[1:25:38] they were crucifying it but you see what
[1:25:41] it is they didn't have on the end
[1:25:42] understanding and that's why Paul could
[1:25:44] say in the book of 1st Corinthians
[1:25:46] chapter 14 when I pray I'll pray with
[1:25:50] understanding when I sing I'll sing with
[1:25:53] understanding you see God wants us to
[1:25:55] sing with understanding that's exactly
[1:25:58] what Israel was singing at that time
[1:26:01] when the Spirit of God struck their life
[1:26:03] they were singing with understanding
[1:26:06] Caiaphas's was not singing with that
[1:26:08] understanding but to think how that Paul
[1:26:11] himself remember Paul would say when
[1:26:14] they're reading this music sheet the
[1:26:16] veil is still upon their heart when they
[1:26:18] read Moses why because they're focused
[1:26:20] on Moses instead of the God who actually
[1:26:22] used Moses and so the veil is upon their
[1:26:26] heart they're still singing the same
[1:26:28] songs but it is not brought a liberty
[1:26:30] and a loosening to their life but to
[1:26:33] know how that Paul led by the Spirit of
[1:26:35] God he himself moved by the unction of
[1:26:37] the Holy Ghost he's moved into the same
[1:26:40] spirit of the composer and Paul standing
[1:26:43] there as a director begins to assemble
[1:26:45] the musicians that are deigned in that
[1:26:48] hour to beat out the song and Paul
[1:26:51] himself would bring the prophets
[1:26:52] see of Psalms 22 and he would bring it
[1:26:55] to a press intense happening where he
[1:26:57] would speak of the great condescension
[1:26:59] of Almighty God and he would say it like
[1:27:02] this in verse 11 for both he that
[1:27:04] sanctifies and they who are sanctified
[1:27:06] are all of one for which calls he's not
[1:27:09] ashamed to call them brethren saying I
[1:27:12] will declare thy name unto my brethren
[1:27:16] in the midst of the church will I sing
[1:27:20] praise unto thee
[1:27:22] you see God Himself becoming our supreme
[1:27:26] sacrifice
[1:27:27] venez he ascended up onto the minitor
[1:27:29] you'll see as the true atonement now he
[1:27:32] sends back his own life the Spirit of
[1:27:34] God they're tying you and I in to the
[1:27:36] real true atonement and we having that
[1:27:39] same life within us it is that same Lord
[1:27:42] Jesus Christ declaring the name of the
[1:27:45] Lord to you and I and in the midst of
[1:27:49] his church walking in the midst of the
[1:27:52] seven golden candlesticks he's singing
[1:27:55] praises you know what that word means to
[1:27:57] sing praise it means to sing hymns aloud
[1:28:00] to a heroic event one who has conquered
[1:28:04] you realize your life it sings a song
[1:28:08] there is a song that song out of your
[1:28:10] life and that song is a song that says I
[1:28:13] will sing unto the Lord the Lord have
[1:28:16] conquered the horse rider in my life
[1:28:20] overthrown sin in my life the Lord a
[1:28:24] triumph lorry asleep in my life do you
[1:28:27] realize that's what the name of the Lord
[1:28:29] does in the life of a believer Oh glory
[1:28:35] he has taken notes that were laid out
[1:28:39] and arranges them for the great symphony
[1:28:44] you know brother Branham would say it
[1:28:46] like this he says you know God asked
[1:28:50] Moses what you got in your hand Moses
[1:28:54] said well I got a stick but you see God
[1:28:57] knew what he had in his hand but God
[1:29:00] wanted him to recognize God knew and God
[1:29:04] was attentive to it
[1:29:06] brother dramas talking about how he said
[1:29:09] look he said no matter how little or how
[1:29:12] you know significant what's in your hand
[1:29:15] you may not have a stick but you can
[1:29:18] testify you can sing or you can pass out
[1:29:22] tracts you can pale somebody whatever's
[1:29:26] in your hand get moving
[1:29:28] let's fill these seats up and get people
[1:29:32] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:36] whatever God has put in your hand use it
[1:29:41] think of this here let me come down here
[1:29:46] brother Evan says all I just love good
[1:29:48] singing
[1:29:49] he said we're grateful to these men who
[1:29:53] are with us he said for sister su
[1:29:55] carrion and the other singers the
[1:29:57] musicians and so forth to bring us the
[1:29:59] gospel in the way of singing and in
[1:30:03] music he realized that God God himself
[1:30:08] now with music now as we look at this
[1:30:11] year God with music took a time when
[1:30:14] Jehoshaphat and them did not know what
[1:30:17] to do when the army was approaching and
[1:30:19] the Bible says one of theirs of the
[1:30:22] priests I believe is one of those who
[1:30:23] would be of the song of the song leaders
[1:30:26] in that time rose up there under the
[1:30:28] spirit of prophecy and begin to prophesy
[1:30:30] and how that you find that the Bible
[1:30:32] says that they went out God said you'll
[1:30:34] not have to fight today but you'll just
[1:30:36] stand still and watch the Lord fight for
[1:30:39] you the Bible says they sent out singers
[1:30:42] special singers ahead and they sung
[1:30:46] Beauty to His Holiness and when they
[1:30:51] begin to sing that song the Bible says
[1:30:54] that the enemy begin to smite one
[1:30:57] another and they smote one another too
[1:31:00] where Israel then came on the scene and
[1:31:03] they just simply had to pick up the
[1:31:05] spoils now you tell me you would like to
[1:31:11] have have more services like that
[1:31:14] come on where we can just go and pick up
[1:31:17] spoil come on somebody you see you may
[1:31:21] not be the miriam that starts it but
[1:31:23] when miriam starts get your tambourine
[1:31:25] and get going
[1:31:26] get your hands and get going start
[1:31:28] moving within the spirit what little
[1:31:30] Sonya I don't want to get in the flesh
[1:31:31] you realize friends you're gonna stay in
[1:31:33] the flesh if you stay in that attitude
[1:31:35] you've got to make up your mind what
[1:31:37] kind of a flesh or attitude do you want
[1:31:39] I'll tell you right now there's a lot of
[1:31:42] things that can look negative all around
[1:31:44] but brother there ain't nothing negative
[1:31:46] in the Lord Jesus Christ when I've come
[1:31:49] to the house of God I don't come to look
[1:31:51] at all of the problems and all the
[1:31:52] weaknesses and everything else I come
[1:31:55] here to worship the Lord I come here to
[1:31:57] deliver my heart and preach what God has
[1:31:59] placed on my heart I come here with a
[1:32:02] delight to hear from Almighty God I want
[1:32:05] to see God move
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:11] hallelujah to think of this here of how
[1:32:15] that David would say it like this
[1:32:17] and they just try to come down David
[1:32:19] would make it known like this in Psalms
[1:32:21] 119 he would say that statuettes have
[1:32:26] been my songs in the house of my
[1:32:29] pilgrimage that statures notice that
[1:32:33] statuettes have been my songs so David
[1:32:36] by the help of the Holy Spirit the Sun
[1:32:39] his statuettes were not just things of
[1:32:41] mere words but there had actually been
[1:32:44] an assembling and arrangement together
[1:32:46] by the Spirit of God to wear the statues
[1:32:50] themselves were not just words they were
[1:32:52] songs to him in his pilgrimage what
[1:32:56] you're glad for songs remember songs
[1:32:59] themselves just a little tune just a
[1:33:01] little melody it can get you thinking
[1:33:03] the right way you're not see just a
[1:33:06] little melody just a little bit can
[1:33:08] actually take your thinking and open you
[1:33:11] up the right way God knows exactly what
[1:33:13] he's doing
[1:33:14] no wonder that the scripture Paul would
[1:33:16] admonish us in this hour in the book of
[1:33:19] Ephesians chapter 5 and say be and maybe
[1:33:21] you're not unwise but understanding what
[1:33:24] the will of the Lord is and be not drunk
[1:33:26] with wine wherein is
[1:33:27] excess but be filled with the spirit
[1:33:29] speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns
[1:33:33] and spiritual songs singing and making
[1:33:36] melody in your heart to the Lord come on
[1:33:41] somebody this right here was already a
[1:33:44] playlist before that term ever came up
[1:33:47] this was not created by iTunes this is
[1:33:50] from the I am he don't have junk music
[1:33:55] on his site mother when he downloads
[1:33:59] these things in your life these are
[1:34:01] songs that are a part in your life
[1:34:03] they are chords that can be struck in
[1:34:06] that time as a matter of fact that word
[1:34:08] says making melody in your heart it
[1:34:11] means that corresponding part that when
[1:34:13] the Spirit of God moves down there's a
[1:34:15] vibration on the inside that corresponds
[1:34:18] let the spirit of Almighty God Paul
[1:34:22] would go on and say in Colossians 3:16
[1:34:25] let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:34:28] richly in all wisdom teaching and
[1:34:31] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[1:34:34] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[1:34:38] grace in your hearts to the Lord you see
[1:34:46] this journey what God is doing right
[1:34:50] here for Israel they're going to come
[1:34:53] into more opposition this is a practical
[1:34:59] practical song they're going to come
[1:35:04] into times when things aren't just right
[1:35:07] maybe it'll be financial maybe it'll be
[1:35:10] me when they have are going through
[1:35:11] physical things in their life and
[1:35:14] they're gonna need to sing this song now
[1:35:19] you know it may not be that they would
[1:35:20] remember that song but maybe one of the
[1:35:25] brothers would you know they would have
[1:35:26] a little arrangement and they would get
[1:35:29] up and say we got a special today oh
[1:35:31] yeah wonder what wonder what song it is
[1:35:35] it's it's one you all know really
[1:35:39] you know and they would get up and start
[1:35:41] singing it and maybe they're here this
[1:35:43] one in the congregation it would strike
[1:35:46] their heart it wasn't that they didn't
[1:35:49] know it they might actually be able to
[1:35:51] sing along with the words but telling
[1:35:53] what's going on it's actually the Spirit
[1:35:55] of God that's moving at that time to
[1:35:59] minister to them inside God knows what
[1:36:08] he's doing with music when I think of it
[1:36:13] and I've studied many of the great ones
[1:36:14] down through time some of the great
[1:36:16] things when we look at songs that have
[1:36:19] been wrote you think of songs like that
[1:36:22] of one of them you think of how brother
[1:36:24] branham look at this now watch how
[1:36:26] brother Branham stood here you many of
[1:36:28] you know how brother Ram talks about
[1:36:29] brother booth-clibborn right how brother
[1:36:31] Ram talks about him and brother Ram says
[1:36:33] I love that song that he wrote down from
[1:36:35] his glory he said what a song of divine
[1:36:38] inspiration in this hour
[1:36:40] he said when all of the organizations
[1:36:42] are working to take away the deity of
[1:36:45] the Lord Jesus Christ he said but right
[1:36:48] in the midst of that song he said oh I
[1:36:50] love that song and yet brother
[1:36:54] booth-clibborn is the very one that
[1:36:56] would tell brother Branham you don't
[1:36:58] know your Bible real well but brother
[1:37:03] Branham says but I know the author real
[1:37:05] well but the random would also go on to
[1:37:08] tell us he said now brother booth
[1:37:09] cleverly said of loving he's a bosom
[1:37:11] friend he said to what it is he said we
[1:37:13] don't even see eye to eye on doctrine
[1:37:19] they didn't see eye to eye but you see
[1:37:22] what it was how could be the random sing
[1:37:24] down from his glory because brother
[1:37:26] banner recognized he was inspiration
[1:37:28] from the Holy Ghost it passes through
[1:37:31] the filter of the word and declared
[1:37:34] Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday
[1:37:36] today and forever I hope you understand
[1:37:40] what I'm saying we might have a book
[1:37:42] that's called the only belief book but
[1:37:43] brother Branham never put that together
[1:37:46] that is not the message hymnal
[1:37:51] come on somebody you recognize what the
[1:37:54] Methodists did in their day they
[1:37:56] actually formed a convention that
[1:37:59] brother Brennan would talk about where
[1:38:00] the Methodists no longer wanted certain
[1:38:03] songs sung and put in their hymnals
[1:38:05] brother I'm glad that were free we don't
[1:38:08] got no man-made hymnal we don't got a
[1:38:10] checker can I sing this song can I sing
[1:38:12] that song can I sing this song oh my the
[1:38:15] Holy Ghost the mighty angel is among us
[1:38:18] to let us know and bring discernment in
[1:38:21] this hour rather we don't need the
[1:38:23] leadership a man when we've got the
[1:38:25] leadership of the Holy Ghost the
[1:38:27] leadership of the world and don't worry
[1:38:31] I'll tell you what there's some songs
[1:38:33] that have been written that you know
[1:38:35] what have no part to be sung not just in
[1:38:38] a church they have no part to be sung
[1:38:40] among believers but then there's other
[1:38:44] songs that the Holy Spirit now remember
[1:38:47] depends on where you're at oh my to
[1:38:52] think of it how when the Holy Spirit
[1:38:54] when it's fire brother brandman he would
[1:38:56] sing one of them oh ma he's sung one of
[1:38:58] them a whole lot more with a greater
[1:39:00] understanding and then what those who
[1:39:01] wrote it it was sung with more
[1:39:04] understanding than what it was at Azusa
[1:39:06] Street come on somebody where does it
[1:39:08] matter it matters where you're standing
[1:39:11] glory be to God so to think of this
[1:39:14] practical out working within the songs
[1:39:17] and music that God would allow to come
[1:39:20] about how that brother branham himself
[1:39:21] would actually make these statements
[1:39:23] here and he makes this statement here in
[1:39:26] the message look I'm closing I'm closing
[1:39:28] but I want you to see this in a
[1:39:30] practical manner I didn't want you just
[1:39:32] to look at this tonight has just
[1:39:34] prophetic off here in the prophetic but
[1:39:36] I want you to see this in a prophetic in
[1:39:38] an actual practical manner how many of
[1:39:42] you ever got down before and I've been
[1:39:45] down and if I'd been discouraged in the
[1:39:53] message look 1963 brother branham here
[1:39:56] is speaking regarding brother out walls
[1:39:58] church my brother branham has made some
[1:40:00] mighty fine remarks regarding brother
[1:40:02] out
[1:40:03] Church one of the remarks that brother a
[1:40:05] brother brother branham made is out of
[1:40:07] the message and inside after their
[1:40:10] handing out prayer cards and when
[1:40:12] they're handing out the prayer cards
[1:40:14] their brother branham is wanting the
[1:40:15] song to be sung and then he says you
[1:40:17] know what hold on a moment he said why
[1:40:18] don't we have that choir come back up
[1:40:20] here and sing that song or have the
[1:40:21] choir come back he said I'd like the
[1:40:23] choir to come and you know let them sing
[1:40:25] whatever God has put on their heart
[1:40:27] while the prayer cards are being passed
[1:40:28] out now they begin to sing a song and as
[1:40:32] they sing that song they sing it through
[1:40:34] prayer cards then are still being given
[1:40:35] out but the choir director stands in
[1:40:37] that time and says I'll tell you what he
[1:40:40] says when he said you know we need to
[1:40:42] sing the song that we sung the other
[1:40:43] night that the Holy Ghost came in on and
[1:40:45] they began to sing the song I was there
[1:40:48] when the Spirit came now you can listen
[1:40:50] to it it's 1962 January 19th and inside
[1:40:53] and Buddy they're having a time the
[1:40:55] Spirit of God begins to fall in there
[1:40:57] and let me tell you something they're
[1:40:59] clapping their hands they're shouting I
[1:41:01] believe that director got loosed as well
[1:41:03] and brother Branham says right after
[1:41:04] they get done he said wow how we think
[1:41:07] the Lord for a nice spiritual lift like
[1:41:10] that now that's in 1962 and he said
[1:41:14] there's one outstanding thing about this
[1:41:17] church - brother outlaw one of them is
[1:41:20] they sure are singers now in the message
[1:41:27] look almost a year and a half later
[1:41:29] brother Graham says you know he said the
[1:41:31] first time I was in Phoenix where
[1:41:34] brother outlaw he said I had a record
[1:41:36] that was made during that meeting the
[1:41:39] record y'all know we won't go there when
[1:41:45] I kind of get feeling a little down I go
[1:41:50] play this record but Graham you don't
[1:41:55] put on one of your tapes
[1:42:00] brother Graham you don't go read the
[1:42:01] Bible there's times for that
[1:42:03] do you realize what brother venom is
[1:42:04] telling us here he's not trying to put
[1:42:07] on arrogance and pride I don't ever get
[1:42:09] down he's telling us I get down and he's
[1:42:12] learned as a lawyer how to conquer that
[1:42:16] sometimes you could try to listen to a
[1:42:18] message to you're blue in the face but
[1:42:21] that ain't what you need right then you
[1:42:24] might need to listen to some music when
[1:42:30] I kind of get the feeling a little doubt
[1:42:32] I go play this record and it's about
[1:42:35] scratched out the Carl's brother Ray you
[1:42:41] all hear you brother tell me if it's
[1:42:42] scratched out that would have to mean
[1:42:44] that he's playing it an awful lot that
[1:42:48] would have to mean he's getting down at
[1:42:51] different times but he's got a playlist
[1:42:55] perhaps maybe the man made it is here
[1:42:58] this morning little red flexible record
[1:43:00] he said of course I have many of the
[1:43:02] late records of this young choir here
[1:43:04] which has little babies then singing so
[1:43:07] program one against choirs see it's how
[1:43:11] to balance that word Billy rhymes
[1:43:13] against formality formality hey men we
[1:43:19] don't need nothing worked up when we've
[1:43:21] got the Holy Ghost all brother BAM says
[1:43:25] which was little babies then now they're
[1:43:27] singing we get sweet yet much out of it
[1:43:32] when we heard these fine songs I said to
[1:43:35] brother outlaw I'm glad they're being
[1:43:38] taped because I like to study that
[1:43:43] steady those songs yeah sometimes the
[1:43:48] Holy Spirit will make us to study a song
[1:43:50] like he would take Israel to study this
[1:43:53] song again I'm glad they're being hate
[1:43:57] tape because I like to study it I like
[1:43:59] to hear those songs and play the tape
[1:44:01] hear the songs when you can sit down
[1:44:03] there's nothing like music you know God
[1:44:06] heals by music did you know that he said
[1:44:09] God heals by news
[1:44:12] you realize that if you're down and you
[1:44:15] find yourself getting down at times you
[1:44:17] know what you need to do brother Brandon
[1:44:19] would tell him right in the prayer line
[1:44:20] he said you need to get yourself some
[1:44:22] good gospel music you need to get
[1:44:27] something in it that's singing there
[1:44:28] then there is actual ministry going
[1:44:32] forth that'll take your heart and your
[1:44:34] mind and put it on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:37] upon His redemptive work and let your
[1:44:40] heart study those songs let it think
[1:44:43] upon those songs oh he said God heals by
[1:44:49] love God heals by medicine God heals by
[1:44:53] prayer God has many ways of healing it
[1:44:56] depends on what type you need he talks
[1:45:01] about a little love stretched out will
[1:45:03] cure an old sword an old place that's
[1:45:05] been a grudge or something it'll heal it
[1:45:07] right over just a little love a little
[1:45:09] care he said sometimes when you feel all
[1:45:11] down and as we call it a street
[1:45:14] expression down in the dumps just put on
[1:45:18] one of those tapes that music or record
[1:45:21] and go to playing it the first thing you
[1:45:24] know you are patting your foot or your
[1:45:27] hand and it's all over then you're right
[1:45:31] up and ready to go again this song then
[1:45:42] Moses has come under inspiration it came
[1:45:47] from the cloud and it would be kept in
[1:45:50] the cloud it would be pulled down from
[1:45:54] the great I am NOT the iCloud it would
[1:45:58] be pulled down and streamed when it was
[1:46:01] needed to be streamed it was theirs they
[1:46:05] were locked in this was their song it
[1:46:08] was part of their playlist you see
[1:46:13] that's the same way the Holy Spirit
[1:46:14] that's the same way that he works in the
[1:46:18] redemptive work is to place these songs
[1:46:21] before you and I do you realize that one
[1:46:23] of the favorite songs
[1:46:25] that was sung in bazooka has come was
[1:46:30] written long before Azusa Street but
[1:46:34] they could identify it in that hour the
[1:46:37] comforter has gone they were identifying
[1:46:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is present
[1:46:45] another song they would sing that would
[1:46:48] be a favorite of theirs to sing under
[1:46:50] the blood very beautiful song very soft
[1:46:52] and melodious song under the blood they
[1:46:54] would sing that song and Yeti it was
[1:46:56] written long before Azusa Street what
[1:47:00] was it they were singing it with more
[1:47:03] understanding they didn't need to take
[1:47:07] away that song they were singing it with
[1:47:09] the greater understanding you see that's
[1:47:12] the same way when you and I sing amazing
[1:47:14] grace His grace has brought me safe thus
[1:47:17] far when we sing that verse I can't help
[1:47:20] but think about its things in hell even
[1:47:23] presently how His grace has brought me
[1:47:25] safe this far it's not just words that
[1:47:29] were singing it's a part of our lives
[1:47:33] you see even here tonight that's the
[1:47:35] same way that God wants to be in your
[1:47:37] life if you don't know him as your Lord
[1:47:39] and said you don't know him in the
[1:47:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost in that real
[1:47:43] reality of the new birth I'll to eat or
[1:47:45] not
[1:47:45] just keep walking keep walking and keep
[1:47:48] opening your heart and allow God to
[1:47:50] finish the work in your life
[1:47:52] because let me tell you something he
[1:47:54] puts a song there on the inside of your
[1:47:57] life that it's a song of redemption that
[1:47:59] there's nothing can take it out of your
[1:48:02] life it's a part of you and you are a
[1:48:05] part of it and when that has come in you
[1:48:08] are a part of a great playlist there's a
[1:48:11] playlist that you can reach all the way
[1:48:13] back down through and you're identified
[1:48:16] Jesus I'll never forget what you're done
[1:48:18] for me you can reach back hold to God's
[1:48:21] unchanging hand you see each one of
[1:48:23] these songs were written with
[1:48:26] experiences in their lives and your song
[1:48:30] in your life is by an experience the
[1:48:34] song in my life is by an experience
[1:48:37] you know how we need these songs when we
[1:48:42] come in two times in our life all of a
[1:48:46] sudden when you don't know what you're
[1:48:47] gonna do how am I gonna make this
[1:48:48] payment Jehovah Jireh my provider
[1:48:58] he's encompassing me he was songs of
[1:49:01] deliverance they men that statutes are
[1:49:06] sounds in my pilgrimage these are songs
[1:49:10] that he has given me sounds that he has
[1:49:13] given you Oh glory be to God don't you
[1:49:18] love him
[1:49:19] have no fear he knows exactly where
[1:49:23] you're at he knows what what you're
[1:49:26] going through but remember take this
[1:49:28] into your heart that there are some
[1:49:30] times you and I we need a song we needed
[1:49:35] a song spiritually in this hour and
[1:49:37] there's times that we need a song in our
[1:49:40] life and God knows how to give us a song
[1:49:44] you know how it is just stand with me if
[1:49:46] you would I'm almost stop preaching you
[1:49:49] know how it is sometimes there's a song
[1:49:51] there's been songs sometimes that old my
[1:49:53] you know I've sung my wife will tell you
[1:49:56] she says you know she said I heard you
[1:49:58] get a song she said you just keep going
[1:50:01] on that song you know let the church say
[1:50:06] Amen
[1:50:09] that's where I'm at you see what I'm
[1:50:14] saying unless he doesn't do that you
[1:50:16] know that put me down or whatever more
[1:50:17] but you see then sometimes it can go for
[1:50:20] a period of time and then all of a
[1:50:22] sudden it'll strike in my heart he
[1:50:25] thought I was worth saving
[1:50:27] oh my you see it depends on where I'm at
[1:50:32] in that time then I might be up against
[1:50:35] you know the Red Sea and then I say Oh
[1:50:38] Lord
[1:50:39] he's a winged maker he makes a way where
[1:50:44] there ain't no way
[1:50:45] even when I don't see or don't feel
[1:50:48] you're working you're working you're
[1:50:51] with me and then sometimes it'll drop
[1:50:54] back in our life Jesus I'll never forget
[1:50:56] what you've done for me Jesus I'll never
[1:51:01] forget how you send me free you see it
[1:51:06] drops in our lives
[1:51:10] hey I'm not beside myself I am in one
[1:51:14] way and I'm not in another this is
[1:51:16] exactly when I read and I look at the
[1:51:19] message I see brother Branham enjoying
[1:51:22] his salvation I see him rejoicing I see
[1:51:27] him singing songs
[1:51:29] I see even where God would teach him
[1:51:32] further worship don't you love the Lord
[1:51:39] let's pray
[1:51:41] or Jesus whole father how we thank you
[1:51:48] Lord like Israel you bring us Lord and
[1:51:52] have brought us through experiences that
[1:51:55] the songs of our life are born out of
[1:51:58] experience smart that has meaning to us
[1:52:02] the words it's something about it Lord
[1:52:06] God you can take a person who can sing a
[1:52:09] song like the song we sing when I came
[1:52:13] up here in Christ alone
[1:52:16] but you let Lord one sing this same song
[1:52:21] born of the Spirit of God Locke was
[1:52:25] being sung here tonight Lord brother
[1:52:27] bill leading the congregation my
[1:52:30] brothers and sisters singing that song
[1:52:31] oh my the place where they're singing it
[1:52:34] from oh its greater understanding
[1:52:37] greater understanding Lord
[1:52:39] we certainly don't belittle Lord the one
[1:52:42] who wrote it because we know it was the
[1:52:44] inspiration of the Holy Ghost we have a
[1:52:47] filter of the word to pass it through
[1:52:49] and we can tell that Lord God
[1:52:52] it was wrote we see it father it has
[1:52:56] such meaning to our lives but it just
[1:53:00] goes to show when the Holy Spirit upon
[1:53:06] the life will take ahold of that song
[1:53:08] and begin to sing it oh my they can sing
[1:53:11] it by experience it'll be a deeper
[1:53:15] understanding a deeper experience I
[1:53:17] think of how many times Lord songs that
[1:53:21] we sing like he looked beyond my fault
[1:53:23] many songs that was wrote by dotty Rambo
[1:53:27] Lord God hailed it she would give Lord
[1:53:30] testimony I've marveled many times just
[1:53:32] listening to the testimonies that what
[1:53:35] was the story behind the song it was a
[1:53:41] song that was born out of experience
[1:53:43] this is what it was when Moses and them
[1:53:46] crossed the Red Sea Moses was not saying
[1:53:49] hey hey let's let's write a song no no
[1:53:52] it was inspiration that was dropping he
[1:53:54] was not having to form words that they
[1:53:57] would rhyme this was a soul
[1:54:01] we're Lord as your prophet would call it
[1:54:04] a songwriter this one who's able to
[1:54:07] raise up out of this realm
[1:54:08] he said they go up in a higher realm he
[1:54:11] said and the troubles they have
[1:54:13] sometimes the reason they're regarded as
[1:54:15] neurotics is because they get caught in
[1:54:17] that in between they're coming down and
[1:54:20] they can't get all the way back down
[1:54:21] into earth and they get in that time he
[1:54:24] said and that's why some of them have
[1:54:25] wanted to take their life and have tried
[1:54:27] to do so he said they get so caught up
[1:54:29] and that inspiration and what your
[1:54:31] prophet could relate to him he could
[1:54:34] relate to that being caught up in that
[1:54:36] inspiration like that Lord I think of it
[1:54:39] of great men William Cowper who would
[1:54:45] write there is a fountain filled with
[1:54:46] blood his life Lord when I read the
[1:54:51] history of William Cowper
[1:54:53] and brother Randall would make the
[1:54:55] statement that he was regarded as a
[1:54:57] neurotic when I read the history of that
[1:54:59] man along history and I read it Lord
[1:55:03] just felt moved but the enemy to love
[1:55:04] that song no wonder he was regarded as a
[1:55:08] neurotic there was so much within his
[1:55:11] life as he would try to take his life
[1:55:14] countless times
[1:55:16] he would spend most of his life after
[1:55:20] disappointments in such despondency
[1:55:24] but what inspiration he received from
[1:55:28] the holy ghost there is a fountain
[1:55:31] filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's
[1:55:34] veins when sinners plunged beneath the
[1:55:37] flood lose all their guilty stains ever
[1:55:40] since by faith I saw a stream
[1:55:50] Lord Jesus right here tonight in our
[1:55:54] lives
[1:55:55] there are songs that are sung by
[1:55:59] experience or God throughout this
[1:56:03] congregation their special singers here
[1:56:08] some that actually sing special songs
[1:56:12] right here on the platform yielded
[1:56:16] receiving inspiration and leading from
[1:56:19] you but father they're not the only
[1:56:22] special singers each and every one of
[1:56:26] your believing children are special
[1:56:29] singers there's a song there's a melody
[1:56:32] Lord that you've put in our heart Lord
[1:56:34] odd of redeeming Grace day after day
[1:56:40] moment after moment that song is being
[1:56:44] sung out it's a song that we have
[1:56:48] learned like it would say in the Book of
[1:56:51] Revelations it's a song but only they
[1:56:54] could learn father you have divinely
[1:56:58] instructed in Tallis I pray father
[1:57:03] maybe we take these things and as you
[1:57:06] have brought him in such a practical way
[1:57:09] may we Lord I pray as brother branham
[1:57:12] would speak in the message paradox and
[1:57:15] he would tell us like this he said you
[1:57:17] know Billy keeps that gospel music going
[1:57:22] in our office all through the day he
[1:57:25] said it helps him I know it does he says
[1:57:30] it helps us and then he goes on to tell
[1:57:31] us in that same paragraph he said you
[1:57:34] know musics got power in it music is
[1:57:38] what went before the army of the Lord I
[1:57:43] believe Lord God I'm speaking to your
[1:57:47] people tonight that by the grace of God
[1:57:50] we know there's times we need to listen
[1:57:54] we need to put on that playlist
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:57:58] sometimes the Lord I remember I've come
[1:58:00] out of work sometimes yet out of
[1:58:02] counseling sometimes the Lord away from
[1:58:04] situations even though I'm ready to
[1:58:06] resume and listen to a message but I
[1:58:08] realize I need to get myself right and
[1:58:12] so Lord God I how I find myself I put on
[1:58:14] a song maybe I'll start singing maybe
[1:58:15] its instrumental maybe it's a playlist I
[1:58:18] just begin to let my spirit get right
[1:58:21] again oh Jesus
[1:58:25] how we love you Lord God how we think
[1:58:29] your Lord that you have encompassed our
[1:58:31] life with songs of deliverance Thank You
[1:58:34] Lord God for bringing us songs in the
[1:58:36] night thank you Lord God for giving to
[1:58:40] us Psalms that with you they speak to us
[1:58:44] words that when our hearts just seem
[1:58:47] like we we can't express it but yet the
[1:58:50] melody the words within that song that's
[1:58:52] it that's it that's what's there in my
[1:58:55] heart that's how I'm feeling and Lord we
[1:58:58] can look to you father or Jesus I pray I
[1:59:03] don't know the needs that are here
[1:59:05] tonight but you do and I pray that God
[1:59:07] that you would grant to them the song
[1:59:11] that they have need of may it encourage
[1:59:14] them Lord in their walk with you

[1:59:22] pray that you'll be with your people
[1:59:24] tonight go with us Lord as we depart
