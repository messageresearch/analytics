[33:21] thankful to have a man each of our
[33:23] visitors here with us amen the Lawson's
[33:24] god bless you good to have you here with
[33:26] us man we're good to have so glad to
[33:32] have brother Jeff that he would he and
[33:34] sister Marie that they would make make
[33:36] an exception and come here to be with us
[33:38] and we just so appreciate that so much
[33:41] amen I know that each of you have
[33:45] already heard of concerning with brother
[33:49] John in the passing of his of his father
[33:52] and we just won I know that probably
[33:55] most of you had heard of that and we
[33:58] just want to continue to lift them up as
[33:59] a family in prayer and you know it it
[34:03] just really it struck real close to home
[34:05] last night and my only brother John
[34:08] being here with us but it just really
[34:09] struck real home and knowing that that's
[34:11] just it's daddy and just you know you're
[34:15] it's something about that it's very
[34:16] precious you know and and so we just you
[34:20] know there's a lot of avenues that they
[34:22] they need the doors to open as far as
[34:24] with visas to be able to get there and
[34:26] so forth but you know I know there's
[34:29] nothing that's impossible with the Lord
[34:31] I'm so grateful for that that God is
[34:33] mindful to open doors and and I just so
[34:37] I asked you just to continue to keep
[34:38] them in prayer as well and also I I just
[34:42] I'm sorry I was sitting right there but
[34:43] I can't remember if it was a request
[34:45] made about sister Doris her dad was
[34:50] there a request made okay there I just
[34:52] talked with her again today and and her
[34:56] dad he's not eating and and other things
[34:58] right now and I think he's about 90 is
[35:02] it about 90 and 90 something like that
[35:04] and what you say 92 so you know I know
[35:10] that different family has come in town
[35:12] here this here this weekend and he just
[35:15] needs a touch from the Lord if and
[35:17] that's he certainly needs strength he
[35:19] certainly lived a long life but he needs
[35:21] he needs a touch from the Lord so we
[35:23] just want to hold them up in prayer
[35:25] right now as a family and hold up hold
[35:27] him up in prayer as well for each of
[35:29] them they certainly have a lot that
[35:31] they're dealing with right now so it's
[35:33] just in the midst of all of this God
[35:35] knows all our needs don't eat
[35:38] I'm so glad about that and I believe
[35:40] with all my heart that you know God
[35:42] prepares the experiences you know it's
[35:44] not just the word but God prepares even
[35:47] the man to come with experiences and
[35:50] things from in his life and God will
[35:51] take that direction right through the
[35:53] word and God will minister that right to
[35:56] you and I and I'm so thankful that God
[35:58] is so mindful of that aren't you hey you
[36:01] know you don't have to be but he is he
[36:04] just shows his love and his care and I'm
[36:06] so glad about that tonight
[36:07] amen so let's just turn our turn our
[36:10] attention to the word of the Lord and
[36:11] let's just sing that little song once
[36:13] again that we were singing because we do
[36:15] want God to have his way here tonight
[36:16] amen let go and let God head
[36:23] is wonderful let go and let God head
[36:34] this way
[36:39] your sorrow
[36:42] [Music]
[36:56] [Music]
[36:59] one more time
[37:01] [Music]
[37:36] [Music]
[37:44] praise the Lord I believe that's what
[37:47] every person that really loves the Lord
[37:50] wants is for him to to have its way
[37:52] praise the Lord
[37:53] sure appreciate our brother asking us to
[37:56] come and to be with you tonight I I've
[37:58] never come anytime that I didn't enjoy
[38:00] myself
[38:01] I appreciate the presence of the Lord
[38:03] and and just really appreciate our
[38:05] sister Pat that allowed us to come and
[38:08] to stay with her and it's just so
[38:10] wonderful when you come into somebody's
[38:11] home and it's the presence of the Lord
[38:13] that's there it's so welcoming you know
[38:15] and you know that everything is gonna be
[38:17] alright if he's there he's the Lord
[38:20] let's let's take our Bibles tonight if
[38:22] you would and go with me I didn't give
[38:25] these brothers anything to pull up on
[38:27] the screen so we'll see how good they
[38:29] are tonight and see how quick they can
[38:30] pull these scriptures up for us but
[38:33] let's let's go to John chapter 3 and
[38:35] certainly desire your prayers tonight
[38:38] always desire the leadership of the Lord
[38:40] and we just really we want his
[38:43] leadership tonight we want to say the
[38:44] things that that he wants said and he
[38:46] knows every heart and you know if we can
[38:50] just believe that he's gonna speak to us
[38:52] tonight that he will praise the Lord if
[38:55] I ask how many needs tonight probably
[38:56] every hand in the building would go up
[38:58] because somebody most of us have needs
[39:00] because we're human beings there's
[39:02] things that we deal with because we're
[39:03] human beings you know and God is so
[39:05] mindful even read samuel mentioned in
[39:07] himself you know about how mindful that
[39:08] he is so if we really have a need and we
[39:11] really understand how white God put a
[39:13] fivefold ministry in the church then
[39:16] we'll take that need and we'll hold it
[39:17] right up there before the Lord and he'll
[39:20] answer that voice in John chapter 3 I
[39:23] want to begin in verse 16 I know this is
[39:25] very very familiar to two believers but
[39:28] we want to begin in verse 16 and we'll
[39:30] read 16 17 and 18 before we pray and let
[39:34] you be seated John 3:16 the most famous
[39:37] scripture in the Bible it's been
[39:39] translated into more languages than any
[39:42] other scripture that there is in the
[39:43] Bible and it's it's just so so power all
[39:46] the Word of God is powerful but let's
[39:49] look at this for just a minute here for
[39:51] God so loved the world that He gave His
[39:54] only begotten Son that whosoever
[39:56] believeth in him
[39:58] should not perish but have everlasting
[40:00] life now we read that scripture we quote
[40:04] that scripture we witness to people with
[40:06] that Scripture but let's look at the
[40:08] next verse for just a minute because
[40:10] this is the one that doesn't get read
[40:12] near as often and it has just as much of
[40:15] an impact as some of these others do for
[40:20] God sent not his son into the world to
[40:22] condemn the world but that the world
[40:25] through him might be saved
[40:28] he didn't sit in Christ to condemn the
[40:31] world a lot of people feel like that's
[40:33] why Christ came to the world that's
[40:35] because they have had a different Jesus
[40:37] projected to them Christ came to save
[40:40] the world not to condemn the world
[40:41] that's why every every person he said
[40:44] whosoever will let him come praise the
[40:47] Lord
[40:47] many times because of the way the word
[40:50] has been projected to people it's caused
[40:52] them to have a question in their hearts
[40:54] a question in their minds of you know
[40:56] what does God really want out of my life
[40:58] and why is this like this and why is
[40:59] that maybe the Lord to help us tonight
[41:02] to answer some of those let's read verse
[41:04] 18 he said he that believeth on him is
[41:09] not condemned
[41:10] now that ties those first two together
[41:14] but he that believeth not is condemned
[41:17] already it's the unbelief that a person
[41:20] has that would bring them to
[41:21] condemnation but if they would just
[41:24] believe if they would just accept the
[41:26] remedy as we might would call it what
[41:29] God sent to meet our need everything
[41:33] will be all right he's the Lord he that
[41:36] believeth not is condemned already
[41:38] because he hath not believed in the name
[41:40] of the only begotten Son of God as our
[41:44] heads together you've got an unspoken
[41:47] request on your heart you'd like to
[41:48] raise your hand to the lordy he
[41:50] certainly knows Heavenly Father we stand
[41:53] here before you tonight Lord and as
[41:55] human beings we certainly don't have
[41:57] anything that we can count on Lorne
[42:00] you're the only answer that there is
[42:02] you're the only thing that is solid
[42:03] you're the only thing that's in movable
[42:05] Lord you're the only thing that is
[42:07] certain Lord Jesus we stand before you
[42:09] tonight we need you to come and we
[42:11] to break the bread of life Lord we need
[42:13] you because in the breaking of the bread
[42:15] that their eyes came open and they begin
[42:17] to see you by revelation or they begin
[42:20] to see the word it actually been
[42:21] fulfilled right before their eyes Lord
[42:23] I'm asking you to come tonight and to
[42:25] take this vessel it just move it
[42:27] completely out of the way tonight that
[42:29] you could speak through us Lord and I
[42:31] pray that you just bless every person
[42:32] that's made the effort to be here
[42:34] tonight Lord as they hold their need
[42:35] before you tonight Lord may you direct
[42:38] these lips father and may you put the
[42:40] word in my mouth that can be spoken to
[42:43] them that will help them to overcome the
[42:45] devil Lord we just commit ourselves to
[42:48] you we bind every demon power in the
[42:50] name of Jesus Christ and we ask you to
[42:52] come pour out your spirit upon us Lord
[42:54] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[42:57] god bless you you can be seated brother
[43:07] Samuel told me to make myself at home
[43:09] tonight and then he and then he took the
[43:12] mic away from him he said let me check
[43:14] these batteries I'm gonna make sure
[43:15] they're good for three hours but I
[43:19] promise you I'm not gonna preach three
[43:20] hours tonight but you know this this is
[43:23] a subject that as brother Samuel was
[43:27] saying some of the things that he did
[43:29] about experiences how that the Lord will
[43:31] take those experiences in a man's life
[43:33] and he'll use those experiences to run
[43:35] through the word to to help us in other
[43:38] experiences and different things that
[43:40] that were going through but you know
[43:41] there's something that Satan has done
[43:43] from the very Garden of Eden and he's
[43:46] still doing it today and that's trying
[43:49] to get people to question God's Word if
[43:52] I was going to give this a title tonight
[43:53] you know all the word ties together but
[43:55] if I was going to title it tonight I
[43:57] would just simply call it questioning
[43:59] because we live in an hour when whatever
[44:02] God is doing Satan's going to be right
[44:04] there trying to do something to make
[44:06] people question whether that's God or
[44:08] not I mentioned to the last couple
[44:10] services at home you know but we we live
[44:13] in an hour when we don't have to wonder
[44:15] what God is going to do because we've
[44:18] already seen what God's going to do
[44:19] we've heard what God's going to do and
[44:21] now we're actually experiencing what he
[44:23] said he would do
[44:24] ourselves have stepped into this vision
[44:27] of the message of the hour and we
[44:28] ourselves have become the voice of God
[44:31] upon the earth and he's all but I ain't
[44:34] no voice of God yes you are your life
[44:36] will speak louder than any word that you
[44:38] can say and it's that life right there
[44:40] that's going to judge a dying world if
[44:43] they don't accept what Christ sets
[44:45] before now what Satan will do is he'll
[44:48] get somebody to stand before you that'll
[44:51] make you question something that's going
[44:53] on every single time that God is going
[44:55] to do something all the way down through
[44:57] time when God begin to do something the
[44:59] enemy came in there and tried to do
[45:01] something to pull everybody's mind away
[45:03] from what God was actually doing praise
[45:06] the Lord
[45:07] if you look at the very times and I you
[45:10] know I I'm a pastor but I preached by
[45:13] inspiration so you all just pray for me
[45:15] because I want to be able to go right
[45:17] down through here the way that I feel
[45:19] like the Lord wants me to go but you
[45:21] know every single time that God has done
[45:23] something Satan's always raised it up to
[45:25] try to do something to bring people away
[45:27] from that or to make them question that
[45:28] or whatever and you know in the days of
[45:30] Noah he raised up all around even to
[45:34] play there's only 8 people saved in the
[45:36] days of Noah it wasn't because the word
[45:38] wasn't preached it was it wasn't because
[45:40] there wasn't an answer there was an
[45:42] answer come on the very life that Noah
[45:44] was living was the manifestation that
[45:46] God had spoken to him because he wasn't
[45:48] going around just telling people you
[45:50] know hey we're gonna build a boat man
[45:51] you know he was building a boat you know
[45:54] he wasn't talking about all we're gonna
[45:55] do this and we're gonna do that he was
[45:57] doing that come on buddy so hard now
[46:01] look he I think he's here so you hold on
[46:03] ok you know better man said when they
[46:07] were down there in Egypt he said they
[46:08] weren't talking about applying the token
[46:10] he said they were applying the token it
[46:13] wasn't talking about picking out a lamb
[46:15] and going and getting the blood and
[46:16] doing this now they were actually
[46:18] putting the blood on the doorpost it was
[46:20] on display everybody knew it was praise
[46:24] the Lord now we live in the hour it's
[46:26] exactly the same thing for us because
[46:27] God has come down in such a way there's
[46:29] not going to be anybody that can stand
[46:31] in this day and be able to say well you
[46:33] know I just really didn't know what to
[46:34] do Lord
[46:35] no sir it's been it's been put together
[46:38] too perfectly for us to say I just
[46:41] really didn't know what to do or it's
[46:43] been made so plain that even a fool
[46:45] cannot air their it you know that's the
[46:48] word and as long as we stay with that
[46:50] word then we're going to be alright if
[46:52] you don't stay with the word then you're
[46:53] condemning yourself I had somebody ask
[46:55] the question the other day said so what
[46:57] about the judgments was yesterday's
[46:59] every person going to stand in the
[47:01] judgment Allah that's not easy to answer
[47:03] to a sinner because I'm not gonna stand
[47:07] there I don't plan on being there
[47:13] brother sister I you said well Jeff you
[47:15] gotta be there I will be there but not
[47:17] to be judged this word is judging me now
[47:21] I'm judging myself now I'm allowing this
[47:23] word to mold me and shake me and make me
[47:26] what God wants me to be
[47:27] therefore when it comes judgement time
[47:29] I'll be with him doing the judges I
[47:31] won't be off there being judge but I'll
[47:33] be with him because I become the word
[47:36] from my day and they're going to be
[47:38] judged by the word for their day now the
[47:40] word for the day ain't gonna be just
[47:41] every preacher that stood in the pulpit
[47:43] but it's going to be those people that
[47:45] actually received that word and then
[47:47] they became that word because of their
[47:49] receiving of the work he's the Lord if
[47:53] Satan can get us to question the word of
[47:55] God in any way for the men said you're
[47:57] on your way out then now if I know that
[48:01] you said that there was visitors here
[48:02] and if you don't understand why I'm
[48:03] saying saying brother Branham it's no
[48:05] different than me saying brother Paul
[48:06] brother Peter brother James
[48:09] you know God spoke through me in all
[48:11] down through time as they were moved by
[48:12] the Holy Ghost God begin to speak
[48:14] through them but you know the main thing
[48:16] that Satan wants to do he doesn't even
[48:19] care he doesn't want you to just turn
[48:21] her back and and walk away all he wants
[48:24] you to do is question the word because
[48:25] if he can get you to question the word
[48:27] then you may as well walk away you
[48:29] understand what I'm saying you have to
[48:31] believe God you have to take God's Word
[48:33] you have to apply it in your life and
[48:35] then just submit yourself to the Lord
[48:38] you see this the scripture says if you
[48:40] resist the devil he'll flee but we don't
[48:42] we don't quote the first part of that
[48:44] scripture the first part says submitting
[48:47] ourselves unto the Lord
[48:49] resist the devil he'll flee so if you're
[48:50] not submitted he's not gonna flee
[48:52] he's just gonna stand there and laugh at
[48:54] you because he knows he's got a right to
[48:55] stand there he said there's a difference
[48:57] but a sister and talking about the token
[48:59] and having the token applied in our
[49:01] lives praise the Lord
[49:04] hey man the devil knows what he's doing
[49:08] he studied us for thousands and
[49:10] thousands of years
[49:11] he knows what makes you tick he knows
[49:12] what makes me tick he knows what takes
[49:14] you off
[49:15] he knows what takes me up come on he
[49:18] knows exactly what he's doing better
[49:20] sister he's not an idiot you know we get
[49:22] you know we get to preach them we get
[49:23] annoying who said that dumb devil you
[49:25] know if that devil was so smart he would
[49:27] just leave us alone but he's never gonna
[49:29] quit and he's not dumb he knows exactly
[49:31] what he's doing and that's why the thing
[49:33] that makes you so upset is what he does
[49:35] every day you know if you would just not
[49:39] let that bother you anymore he'd leave
[49:42] you alone right so once the enemy can
[49:48] get you to question the Word of God he's
[49:52] got you disarmed once the enemy can get
[49:55] you to a place where you're questioning
[49:57] something that God is doing or something
[49:59] that God has done or something God wants
[50:01] to do in any way if he can get you to
[50:03] question that word of God then the next
[50:05] thing that comes as a spirit of doubt
[50:07] and when that spirit of doubt comes in
[50:09] there that spirit of doubt just sets
[50:11] down on you and then you start doubting
[50:13] everything and when you open those doors
[50:16] up every channel that is open it
[50:18] actually opens a channel for something
[50:20] else to come in come on
[50:22] but sister it's no different than on the
[50:24] spiritual side we come in under
[50:27] justification and the Lord doesn't work
[50:29] in our lives and brings us out of the
[50:30] world he saves us and we know that we've
[50:33] been saved we know something's taking
[50:34] place in our lives as we open our
[50:37] channels up to allow God to come in then
[50:39] he'll begin to clean our lives up he'll
[50:41] move us right on into sanctification you
[50:44] know I know this is very simple but
[50:45] it'll help us it will if we'll catch it
[50:47] a little bit but you know it's a
[50:49] constant opening of more channels
[50:51] because in the fall all of our channels
[50:53] got clogged up right well there's only
[50:56] one thing that opens those channels and
[50:58] that's the work now we have to be
[51:00] submissive to the word in order for that
[51:02] channel that come open to where God can
[51:04] use it at the way that he wants to a man
[51:06] doesn't get saved tonight and then he's
[51:08] got a call of God in his life to preach
[51:09] tomorrow he has to open channels in his
[51:13] life up and submit himself to the Word
[51:15] of God so that the work can have
[51:16] preeminence that praise the Lord if thou
[51:22] it goes far enough it'll bring a spirit
[51:24] of unbelief don't question God's Word
[51:28] you say listen I don't understand it
[51:29] there's lots of things we will never
[51:31] understand with system we'll never
[51:33] understand it but we're not asked to
[51:35] understand it as much as we are to
[51:37] believe it just allow God to have
[51:39] preeminence then listen to what brother
[51:41] Branham says in the greatest battle ever
[51:43] fought he said you see his attack he
[51:45] said now listen closely now his attack
[51:48] is what to disbelieve God's work he said
[51:53] can you see the greatest battle that was
[51:55] ever fought he said there's only two
[51:56] forces Satan hang on now what is Satan's
[51:59] weapon against you is to try to get you
[52:03] to disbelieve your weapon you know
[52:06] that's what a bully does a bully acts
[52:09] big and bad and tough because he wants
[52:11] you to doubt whether you can take him
[52:13] out or not raise alert I went to school
[52:18] with a lot of bullies you know they
[52:21] always they got a they can all talk big
[52:22] but it's different when somebody backs
[52:25] up what they got to say praise the Lord
[52:30] maybe I won't go to go into that he says
[52:36] it it he's trying to get you to
[52:39] disbelieve your weapon see and he
[52:41] disarms you he said listen he said real
[52:45] quiet now listen if he can get you to
[52:47] disbelieve that your weapon is
[52:50] equivalent if he gets you to disbelieve
[52:53] that your weapons not strong enough that
[52:55] he has disarmed you so better
[52:59] what's our weapon what are we supposed
[53:01] to use against him who you are I mean
[53:04] what did he tell Gideon he said go in
[53:06] this time I and you shall deliver the
[53:10] children of Israel what was he going in
[53:12] don't call it God never handed him a
[53:14] sword or a
[53:16] and weapon that God said you're a mighty
[53:18] man about amen
[53:20] take this word I've given you then go
[53:22] defeat your enemy yeah it's no different
[53:25] today because we have been given a
[53:27] weapon that will destroy every demon
[53:29] power that there is now I know that I
[53:32] know you know we've got all kinds of
[53:34] fanaticism and things that follows every
[53:36] revival is that what the prophets said
[53:38] there's all kinds of fanaticism that
[53:39] follows every single revival but pros
[53:42] history if there's fanaticism and
[53:43] there's got to be real amen there's got
[53:45] to be a group of people on the earth
[53:47] that are going to raise up that are
[53:49] going to say and do exactly what the
[53:51] prophets said we'd say and do exactly
[53:53] what the Bible said that will say and
[53:55] Duke we're going to live exactly the way
[53:57] the Bible said we'll live everything
[53:59] that he said would take place in the
[54:01] life of a believer that's going to be
[54:02] manifested in the lives of real
[54:04] believers but if Satan trying to get you
[54:07] to question whether you're one of those
[54:09] are not well you know brother I tell you
[54:14] you're just not the best preacher in a
[54:16] message I knew that before I ever got
[54:18] here but you realize that many men they
[54:23] question whether they've even been
[54:25] called or not when God wants to use the
[54:28] gift the way God wants to use the gift
[54:29] if a man is not a deep teacher that he
[54:33] shouldn't try to teach deeply I know I
[54:37] said I know it's real simple you know
[54:38] but it's the truth anyway he man the
[54:41] truth will stand when the world's on
[54:42] fire right if Satan can get you to
[54:46] disbelieve that your weapon is
[54:47] equivalent he's got you're disarmed
[54:50] ready BAM says oh brother Neville I hope
[54:54] you never leave that seat
[54:55] oh I hope and pray not he said he's
[54:58] disarmed you when he gets you to
[55:00] disbelieve that weapon see when you lay
[55:02] that down that finishes your fight when
[55:07] you when you laid out who you are that
[55:09] finishes your fight God's not going to
[55:12] come down here in armas with a k' fifty
[55:14] sevens and all those things that the
[55:16] world is fighting about listen that's
[55:19] just the reason these things are raising
[55:21] up the way they are is because Satan
[55:23] gets everybody's mind on that kind of
[55:24] stuff and we forget what we're here for
[55:26] well you know we're so caught up in the
[55:29] world
[55:29] times that we absolutely questioned look
[55:31] why in the world even put me in this age
[55:35] maybe I'm the only one does that race
[55:39] Satan is a master at what he does you
[55:41] know I said it before he's not an idiot
[55:43] he knows exactly what he's doing he
[55:46] knows how to stumble every single person
[55:48] but God knows how to keep us from
[55:50] stumbling and you see that's the thing
[55:52] is submitting ourselves to that the
[55:54] question won't be there if we submit
[55:56] ourselves to the word because will
[55:58] automatically go to the where we'll go
[56:00] to what God has said we'll apply it in
[56:02] our life and the enemy recognizes
[56:04] whether you know what you're doing or
[56:05] not
[56:07] you know that's why brother Branham said
[56:09] unconfessed sin gives the devil a right
[56:10] to stay there that's listening to
[56:14] message the other day and rather Batum
[56:16] came out and he told those people he
[56:17] said the Lord spoke to him up there in
[56:19] that room he was praying he said Lord
[56:22] what is going on here why does it seem
[56:25] like you can't break through here and he
[56:28] said God spoke to me and said you bring
[56:30] every one of those people up to that
[56:32] altar tonight and make them confess
[56:34] their sin because that unconfessed sin
[56:38] it didn't matter how anointed brother
[56:40] Branham was Satan had a right to sit
[56:42] there and he did because Brennan says
[56:45] why couldn't you break through well he
[56:47] couldn't break through because of the
[56:48] unbelief he's all right unbelief doesn't
[56:50] stop God what it did in the Bible Jesus
[56:53] took a man completely out of the city
[56:55] because of the unbelief in the city so
[56:57] that he could give him what was his
[56:59] right come on brother sister you know
[57:04] what we're in an hour when Satan's going
[57:06] to do anything that he can to get us off
[57:08] the word because if we're just off to
[57:10] even just a little bit then we're off
[57:11] the word we might believe in the Godhead
[57:14] and we might believe it that mysteries
[57:16] have all been revealed you know we might
[57:18] believe all the different things that
[57:19] have taken place in this day but if he
[57:22] can get us off just a little bit in our
[57:23] holiness well I don't think it's really
[57:27] that important but yet for me to read my
[57:29] Bible and prayer every day well the
[57:31] reason that you don't think that's
[57:32] important because you don't read your
[57:33] Bible prayer every day it's kind of
[57:37] simple isn't it God's not going to put
[57:40] us in a position and then not give us an
[57:42] answer
[57:43] to what our problem is you know it's
[57:45] God's grace for the sister that he loves
[57:48] us so much he will not let us stay in a
[57:50] broken condition he will come no matter
[57:53] what our condition is he will come and
[57:55] tell us how to get out of that condition
[57:57] but look God is not going to get down
[57:59] there in the mud and wallet with you in
[58:01] the mud he's not going to get down there
[58:03] and wallow with me in the mud but he'll
[58:05] stand right there with his hand reach
[58:07] down say come on son I'll pull you out
[58:09] of there if you let me I'll lift you up
[58:10] if you let me I want to do something for
[58:13] you please the Lord he said don't lay
[58:21] your weapon down no lay your weapon down
[58:25] you got a shield of faith that'll quench
[58:27] all the fiery darts of the wicked but if
[58:30] you got the shield laying over here it
[58:32] ain't gonna do you no good you've got to
[58:33] hold it up there you've got to have
[58:35] faith that what God is given here is
[58:37] more than enough to defeat the devil and
[58:39] if we just look through the Scriptures
[58:41] we can see that he did it in every
[58:42] circumstance he's defeated Satan don't
[58:44] ever hand there's never been a battle
[58:46] that Satan's ever won when he come
[58:48] against the Lord we've lost lots of
[58:50] battles but he's never lost a war I
[58:52] don't look for him to start now we know
[58:56] that in the Garden of Eden when things
[58:57] took place the way that they did in the
[58:59] garden that was just a fulfillment of
[59:01] God's plan God was not caught off guard
[59:03] by what took place in the Garden of Eden
[59:07] God could not come down there and say
[59:09] Adam I need you to fall from grace I
[59:11] want to fulfill myself here I my
[59:13] attributes have got to be expressed Adam
[59:15] and I need you to just mess up okay but
[59:17] God knew that they would and he knew
[59:20] that by doing that then he would be able
[59:22] to express himself many times we don't
[59:24] even recognize what's going on and God
[59:27] may be bringing us around and putting us
[59:28] in the middle of a circumstance that we
[59:30] can't even imagine why we're there but
[59:33] he's doing it and not just to help you
[59:34] but he's doing it for somebody else you
[59:36] know if you look at Paul and Silas and
[59:39] the way that they preach the gospel I
[59:40] mean they were on fire they went around
[59:42] setting cities on fire and then they got
[59:44] sitar beat out of them they got locked
[59:46] up and changed and thrown in the middle
[59:47] of Jail right down in the middle of a
[59:52] dungeon these guys are bleeding they're
[59:55] hurting but they decided to work
[59:57] God they decided that they'd rather sing
[1:00:00] about it they'd rather give God praise
[1:00:02] that they've been counted worthy amen
[1:00:05] they would much rather have done that
[1:00:07] and look God did all of that because
[1:00:09] that jailer needed you saved he's all
[1:00:13] better Jeff that's not why well you you
[1:00:15] try to convince that jailer that it
[1:00:17] wasn't he and his house were saying
[1:00:21] because Paul and Silas took a beatin
[1:00:25] come on read it sister
[1:00:27] many times we look at those situations
[1:00:30] and God does something you know look at
[1:00:32] the life of Joseph or me like I'm you
[1:00:34] know I'm just gonna preach okay look at
[1:00:37] the life of Joseph for a minute you know
[1:00:39] and what those brothers did to him was
[1:00:42] outrageous what they had in their heart
[1:00:46] to do to him you wouldn't think about it
[1:00:48] especially somebody that's considered to
[1:00:50] be a Christian but they were writing a
[1:00:54] will of gun he said I know but that
[1:00:57] wasn't the will of God look God already
[1:00:59] had a plan how he was going to get
[1:01:00] Joseph down there Joseph had already
[1:01:03] seen the vision the word had already
[1:01:05] been given and God had to do something
[1:01:07] to get him down there where he could be
[1:01:09] fulfilled
[1:01:10] now watch the real Christian Joseph
[1:01:13] didn't complain his whole way down there
[1:01:14] he wasn't fussing and arguing and
[1:01:17] fighting in the yard I don't understand
[1:01:19] this you know I'm sick and tired of it I
[1:01:20] don't even want to be a Christian
[1:01:21] anymore it wasn't that way at all what
[1:01:24] was in him was just being expressed
[1:01:28] hallelujah hey my sister it's something
[1:01:32] that should just come out of us because
[1:01:34] it's part of us you know all the things
[1:01:36] that Joseph went through I mean look at
[1:01:38] the things that he went through and what
[1:01:40] was it now God did not give Joseph a
[1:01:44] book when he was born and saying I just
[1:01:45] keep reading this book over and over and
[1:01:47] over and it'll tell you what you are but
[1:01:50] he was a perfect a perfect type of Jesus
[1:01:52] Christ amen
[1:01:55] now he gave us the book come on he gave
[1:01:59] us the book he said just keep reading it
[1:02:02] until you believe it because this is
[1:02:04] what you are it says everything that you
[1:02:07] are if you'll just follow the directions
[1:02:10] if you'll just follow what I've given
[1:02:12] you and just walk in these things but
[1:02:14] Satan wants us to question you know we
[1:02:17] pick up our Bible in silora I just
[1:02:19] really need help Lord if you really need
[1:02:21] you to speak to me and you open it up
[1:02:23] and it's Matthew chapter 1 and so on so
[1:02:25] begat so and so and we get so on
[1:02:26] somebody gets on then that really
[1:02:29] doesn't help me right now lord I need an
[1:02:31] answer he already told you believe all
[1:02:35] things were possible to them that
[1:02:36] believe but I don't know if he loves me
[1:02:40] or not for God so loved the world that's
[1:02:43] all of us he gave us his work nothing
[1:02:46] will ever change that nobody can make it
[1:02:49] any different he's over Jim you know if
[1:02:52] I could do this and if I could do that
[1:02:53] if I could do that if you could do
[1:02:55] something that he didn't need to die he
[1:02:57] died because we couldn't do anything
[1:02:59] because he loved us so much all it takes
[1:03:06] sometimes it's just that one little
[1:03:09] thing to be thrown in there to make us
[1:03:11] question what God is doing I want you to
[1:03:15] think about this for just a minute you
[1:03:16] know but when Moses is there his mother
[1:03:21] is teaching him constantly why he's
[1:03:23] there in the house of Pharaoh he's being
[1:03:27] raised up in the house of Pharaoh he's
[1:03:28] an ingenious man if you study history
[1:03:31] and stuff you'll find out he actually
[1:03:32] conquered many countries for Egypt he
[1:03:35] was a great a great warrior you know and
[1:03:37] when he decided that it was time for him
[1:03:39] to move he was doing it in his own
[1:03:41] intellectual conception and that that's
[1:03:43] why it didn't work and then he ran and
[1:03:44] got away from God you know but God that
[1:03:46] didn't stop God's plan it didn't change
[1:03:49] anything at all God just had to get him
[1:03:52] out Terry could beat all of that you
[1:03:54] know worldly nonsense out of him hello
[1:03:57] brother if you're in the middle of a
[1:04:00] beating right now it's probably because
[1:04:01] he's trying to somehow love you but look
[1:04:04] he wants to get it out of you because he
[1:04:06] wants to use you for something he's got
[1:04:09] a purpose in your life he's not just
[1:04:11] putting you through it because he likes
[1:04:12] to put his people through things but
[1:04:15] he's got a plan and a purpose in what
[1:04:17] he's doing and when we're questioning
[1:04:18] the plan and the purpose then he kind of
[1:04:20] puts a hold on things
[1:04:23] now Moses comes back and he meets he
[1:04:25] meets God you know better man City and
[1:04:27] he had more in five minutes after
[1:04:29] meeting a pillar fire then he did in all
[1:04:30] those 40 years before because now he met
[1:04:33] God and now he actually knew what the
[1:04:35] plan of God was now I ask you this
[1:04:38] question did he have a revelation of how
[1:04:40] God was going to bring him out of there
[1:04:44] come on the God gives revelation when we
[1:04:48] have need of Revelation right we don't
[1:04:52] want to be like those people that you
[1:04:54] know I tell you we've got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:57] now and should we seek God for gifts by
[1:04:59] the man said oh don't do that
[1:05:00] he said don't do that he said just be a
[1:05:03] Christian just live right and God will
[1:05:05] give you what you need when you need it
[1:05:07] raise the Lord you know here Moses goes
[1:05:10] down and does exactly what God says and
[1:05:12] the Egyptians they call up their
[1:05:15] magicians and they throw down their rod
[1:05:16] and they turn into snakes and everything
[1:05:18] and it looks like Moses is an idiot I
[1:05:21] mean think about it now if there's ever
[1:05:24] going to be a question come up God told
[1:05:27] him you go down there and give my people
[1:05:28] he said I've heard their cries I've
[1:05:30] heard their groaning I've seen the
[1:05:32] bondage that they're under and I am come
[1:05:34] down to deliver them now go get him
[1:05:38] praise the Lord there's a point I'm
[1:05:40] trying to make in this better sister
[1:05:42] look he has come down and he come down
[1:05:46] for the same thing he come down to
[1:05:48] deliver of people now go get up hey man
[1:05:51] God's got a people an army on the earth
[1:05:54] that he's going to use to get those
[1:05:56] children and bring them out of that
[1:05:57] bondage if there's ever a time of
[1:06:01] questioning it could have been that time
[1:06:02] for Moses as he was standing there
[1:06:04] yeah but Moses didn't question God said
[1:06:07] I'm gonna bring him out of there Moses
[1:06:09] held on to that word and that word
[1:06:11] actually did exactly what God said it
[1:06:13] would even when the people turned
[1:06:15] against him Oh God
[1:06:18] I mean Moses is right in the line of
[1:06:20] duty and Pharaoh says oh you want to go
[1:06:24] worship you want me to cut you overtime
[1:06:27] off no we're gonna add to it we're just
[1:06:31] even gonna take the straw away you guys
[1:06:33] go get your own straw and make sure
[1:06:35] every brick is going to be
[1:06:37] livered and the people turned against
[1:06:41] Moses Moses come walking through and
[1:06:43] they said why have you done this never
[1:06:47] said you come down here it's been
[1:06:49] nothing but a great battle Pharaoh is
[1:06:53] turned against us you know it used to be
[1:06:55] a little easier around here
[1:06:57] anybody can live for the devil right so
[1:07:02] lord I was witnessing to a man one time
[1:07:05] and you know he was standing there just
[1:07:07] smoking like crazy and talking about
[1:07:08] going to heaven and I said brother I
[1:07:09] said you don't think you're gonna meet
[1:07:11] God with that cigarette in your hand do
[1:07:13] you and he kind of looked at me and I
[1:07:15] said I wouldn't try that if I were you I
[1:07:17] said God's not going to dwell in an
[1:07:19] unclean vessel he kind of looked at me
[1:07:26] yeah Sam is enjoyable and he said boys
[1:07:30] you're a rough old coot ain't you and I
[1:07:33] said brother the word is true
[1:07:36] you know I said God wants you to be free
[1:07:38] of that thing I said so he sent me here
[1:07:40] today
[1:07:41] to help my brother on this roof job
[1:07:43] because he knew you won't come up here
[1:07:44] and I was gonna get to talk to you and
[1:07:47] he just kind of looked at me out and I
[1:07:49] said look if you really want to know God
[1:07:51] I said you've got to submit yourself to
[1:07:53] him I said you can't run with the world
[1:07:56] and expect to go to heaven it ain't
[1:07:58] gonna work that way he said man you're a
[1:08:00] tough old Buzzard I said I'm not a

[1:09:13] resistant we've been anointed in this
[1:09:15] day to do the things that God's called
[1:09:17] us to do we've been anointed for the
[1:09:19] challenge of that of Leodis here he's a
[1:09:23] lord better give off of that a little
[1:09:27] bit
[1:09:29] praise the Lord a man says this and
[1:09:35] faith in the Son of God he's this man
[1:09:38] we're talking to him he's a reverend
[1:09:39] enemies that if we had no automobiles no
[1:09:41] gunpowder no atomic bomb man would still
[1:09:43] die better man said just a minute doctor
[1:09:48] he wouldn't have died if you hadn't left
[1:09:52] the Tree of Life
[1:09:55] praise the Lord brother sister you can't
[1:09:59] be on the Tree of Life and the tree of
[1:10:00] the knowledge of good and evil at the
[1:10:02] same time God don't like mixed treats
[1:10:09] it's his scene Hinds pure praise the
[1:10:13] Lord you can't you can't serve God and
[1:10:15] Mammon you can't mix the two together
[1:10:18] come on now look you gotta love me
[1:10:21] enough get to heaven
[1:10:24] praise the Lord if he said be at home
[1:10:29] that means preach I can't preach at home
[1:10:30] right
[1:10:33] if he hadn't left the tree see he left
[1:10:36] the Tree of Life leaving that tree
[1:10:39] brought death that's right
[1:10:42] he said now that's just the results of
[1:10:45] leaving that tree but as long as he
[1:10:48] stayed with the Tree of Life
[1:10:49] he lived forever when he left the tree
[1:10:52] and refused this tree and eat of the
[1:10:55] tree disobeying God that's when the
[1:10:59] question mark across God's Word game he
[1:11:02] said now to me
[1:11:04] that's when death sets in when you put a
[1:11:07] question mark on God's Word you know
[1:11:09] that yep I really don't believe that
[1:11:11] brother Branham was a prophet it really
[1:11:12] doesn't matter whether we believe he's a
[1:11:14] prophet or not he's a prophet anyway
[1:11:17] hazel or a man but as you know I really
[1:11:22] don't know about this cloud thing well
[1:11:23] let me ask you a question have you ever
[1:11:25] studied history at all to find out about
[1:11:28] that star that led the wise men to Jesus
[1:11:32] hello
[1:11:35] raise the Lord did it lead them to the
[1:11:39] leaving work come on start with the
[1:11:43] clock amen it will lead you to the
[1:11:48] Living Word because it's exactly the
[1:11:50] same thing it was God's Word brought
[1:11:53] into manifestation that if we walk in
[1:11:55] that word it'll bring us right into that
[1:11:57] life huh
[1:11:59] even brother Branham said himself he
[1:12:01] said there's nowhere in history that you
[1:12:03] can find that that star was ever seen by
[1:12:06] any other observatory or anything else
[1:12:08] but it was there just the same come on
[1:12:11] look when they went running into the
[1:12:14] city and begin to question where is he
[1:12:16] where is he
[1:12:17] you see the problem was if they'd have
[1:12:19] stayed following the start
[1:12:21] they'd had never had to address a
[1:12:22] question where is it they'd have been
[1:12:24] led right straight to him hey man that's
[1:12:28] powerful Ray's alert stay with the stalk
[1:12:32] the one that was in his right here the
[1:12:35] seventh one that brought the revelation
[1:12:37] of the word for this day not for another
[1:12:40] day brother sister we have a more sure
[1:12:41] word of prophecy a more sure word
[1:12:44] present day through that is the more
[1:12:48] sure word of prophecy is present they
[1:12:49] drew he's the Lord
[1:12:53] that's when death sets in when they
[1:12:56] begin to question put a question mark on
[1:12:59] God's Word then death set in why do you
[1:13:04] think it's so easy for people that's
[1:13:07] been around this message for years and
[1:13:09] years and years to all of the sudden all
[1:13:11] of a sudden it's not true anymore all of
[1:13:15] a sudden I made a mistake
[1:13:17] all of a sudden it's false and it's a
[1:13:19] cult and it's this that somewhere down
[1:13:21] the road a long time ago they started
[1:13:23] questioning one little thing and instead
[1:13:26] of going to a good Holy Ghost field
[1:13:28] pastor like they should have so a
[1:13:31] brother Jeff you know I you know how if
[1:13:33] I questioned some I wouldn't ever go to
[1:13:34] my pastor be careful you're giving that
[1:13:37] thing a place to stay there but God put
[1:13:39] a pastor in the church to help you and
[1:13:41] he'll recognize when you come what you
[1:13:44] have need of and he'll cast that thing
[1:13:45] off of you and you'll be able to get
[1:13:47] back with God where you need to be
[1:13:49] praise the Lord
[1:13:52] that's just look we don't have to have a
[1:13:54] prophet that stands up here and calls us
[1:13:56] out and calls are saying out we know
[1:13:58] what we're doing wrong amen
[1:14:00] but it's still the same Holy Ghost it's
[1:14:02] still the same discerning spirit that
[1:14:05] calls these things out during the
[1:14:06] services and God does it for one purpose
[1:14:08] get your eyes back on the goal
[1:14:10] start watching the work just like he
[1:14:13] said keep your eyes on the goal when the
[1:14:16] goal is Christ anointed work
[1:14:34] you know I think we've got so many
[1:14:36] perfect types that lay in the word and
[1:14:38] we can always go back to those things
[1:14:40] and God can always go into the old and
[1:14:42] bring out new because when the word is
[1:14:44] anointed it it starts opening up in a
[1:14:46] way that you've never seen it before
[1:14:47] that's why sometimes your pastor comes
[1:14:50] in he he plants and he plants and he
[1:14:52] plants and he plows any plants and he
[1:14:53] plows any plants any weeds and he does
[1:14:55] everything that he can't and an
[1:14:56] evangelist will come through and preach
[1:14:58] a message and you go thank God I see
[1:15:03] it's a truth but you see Paul planted in
[1:15:07] Apollo's watered but God gave the
[1:15:09] increase some of the pastors laboring in
[1:15:12] laboring and he's doing all the work and
[1:15:13] he evangelist looks like Superman but
[1:15:17] remember it's the same God that's
[1:15:20] working through all of them it's the
[1:15:22] same God that's doing the work in the
[1:15:24] life of the believer to get them the
[1:15:26] place where they need to be and you know
[1:15:28] Moses went in and called out 12 spies
[1:15:30] and said I want you to go here in spy
[1:15:32] out this land and look brother sister
[1:15:34] before they went there they knew what
[1:15:36] was there Moses had already told them
[1:15:38] under inspiration what was there he had
[1:15:41] already said it's a land flowing with
[1:15:42] milk and honey because God told him it
[1:15:44] was a land flowing milk and he already
[1:15:46] told him the land alone everything
[1:15:48] belonged to them but what happened is
[1:15:50] they got over there and saw the
[1:15:52] circumstances that he didn't say nothing
[1:15:54] about what if all these giants were here
[1:15:58] why didn't he tell me about it
[1:15:59] because God no care about Giants he's a
[1:16:02] giant killer what about all these
[1:16:05] serpents he's a serpent bruiser what
[1:16:08] about all this sickness he's a healer
[1:16:10] he's a deliverer he's everything we need
[1:16:13] hey man God's not worried about the
[1:16:16] obstacle he's not worried about
[1:16:17] circumstance hey man he's got it all
[1:16:20] under control he can change on all of
[1:16:23] those things but they begin to question
[1:16:27] because the circumstance was different
[1:16:29] when they thought it was going to be
[1:16:33] maybe I shouldn't ask for a raise of
[1:16:35] hands but how many of you all came out
[1:16:37] of the world into this message and never
[1:16:42] had a battle
[1:16:46] okay yeah see I'm glad I didn't ask for
[1:16:48] a raise of hands hazel or is there
[1:16:52] anybody in here tonight that can really
[1:16:54] tell me that you've never made a mistake
[1:16:56] since you got saved but sir he's not
[1:17:02] worried about our mistakes he's not
[1:17:05] worried about our obstacles he knows the
[1:17:07] beginning all the way down to the end he
[1:17:09] even knows what's going on in the middle
[1:17:10] but he's not worried about what's going
[1:17:13] on in the middle because you're
[1:17:13] beginning as you're in Jesus could say I
[1:17:23] come from God and I return to God I was
[1:17:26] God when I left the ramparts of glory
[1:17:28] then when I go back I'll still be gone
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:34] hallelujah I was a son of God in the
[1:17:37] mind of God from before the foundation
[1:17:39] of the world now look I will never go
[1:17:41] back to being in his mind I am now the
[1:17:44] manifestation of what was in his mind he
[1:17:49] said I'm not questioning whether I'm a
[1:17:51] son of God or not I'm not questioning my
[1:17:55] circumstances raised the Lord well it's
[1:18:02] so easy for you preachers yeah all right
[1:18:05] I get so tired of hearing that we live
[1:18:13] in one of these two come on that's right
[1:18:17] we're all dirtbags whether we come on
[1:18:21] he's alone look the seed goes in dirt
[1:18:25] doesn't it let me plant your garden you
[1:18:27] put it in the dirt it all goes in the
[1:18:28] dirt but what's in the dirt is not the
[1:18:32] dirt what's in the dirt
[1:18:35] that's placed there is what comes out is
[1:18:38] the life raised the Lord you know it's
[1:18:41] such a simple thing to me we would not
[1:18:44] have near the problem with the false
[1:18:46] doctrines that we have in this message
[1:18:48] if people would just look back 30 years
[1:18:50] ago or 40 years ago or whenever they
[1:18:52] started it and look there was a seed
[1:18:54] there it looks so good it was so
[1:18:57] anointing
[1:18:58] he could preach I'm telling you that man
[1:19:01] was anointed so his devil that's what
[1:19:04] the scripture says he's the anointed
[1:19:06] cherub and he said and I have said Nisa
[1:19:09] so the devil could say huh I'm anointed
[1:19:11] I'm a protector of the heart and he's
[1:19:14] saying exactly what God said and the
[1:19:17] whole time iniquity laying in his heart
[1:19:18] he said one day I'm gonna knock you off
[1:19:20] one day I'm gonna have your place one
[1:19:23] day I'm gonna be worshipped and he
[1:19:25] certainly done that praise the Lord
[1:19:30] but you realize that didn't change God's
[1:19:32] plan it didn't change God's program
[1:19:35] it doesn't change God's thought about
[1:19:37] you it doesn't change God's thought
[1:19:39] about me so I'll tell you what I my life
[1:19:42] was just so don't worry about what your
[1:19:44] life was go from where you are now and
[1:19:47] just keep your eyes on the cross and
[1:19:48] keep going vote
[1:19:49] just keep looking to Jesus Christ now as
[1:19:51] the word comes forth apply it in your
[1:19:53] life submit yourself to the word biggest
[1:19:56] problem that we have resistors not
[1:19:58] submitting ourselves to the anointed
[1:20:00] were not allowing I'll tell you brother
[1:20:05] they probably not gonna do you much good
[1:20:08] your opinion is not gonna help you a lot
[1:20:11] no more than what my opinion helps you
[1:20:13] but brother sister we've got something
[1:20:14] that is unstoppable
[1:20:16] we've got something that can't be
[1:20:18] defeated we've got something that they
[1:20:19] will not fall by the wayside you know
[1:20:23] Jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:20:24] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:20:27] out of the mouth of God
[1:20:28] and whether it's a word that has been
[1:20:31] written here or a word spoken under
[1:20:33] inspiration if God spoke it to you it'll
[1:20:36] carry you through that's right I'll give
[1:20:39] you an example of that you know that the
[1:20:40] Lord is something that the Lord did for
[1:20:41] me years ago and I'll go back to
[1:20:44] experiences you know but it's something
[1:20:45] that the Lord did for me years ago when
[1:20:47] I was growing up you know my my father
[1:20:50] and my mother divorced when I was a year
[1:20:52] old you know and I always held it
[1:20:53] against my father I absolutely hated it
[1:20:55] because I had to live with my mom and
[1:20:57] stead of living with my dad because I
[1:20:58] want to live with my dad all the time
[1:20:59] you know a boy wants to be with his
[1:21:00] daddy all right I'm glad I never lived
[1:21:03] with him right he didn't know how to be
[1:21:08] a father he didn't know how to be an
[1:21:09] example now don't worry I'll fix it up
[1:21:11] in a minute
[1:21:12] don't think I'm trying to trash my dad
[1:21:13] okay but I want to bring you to an
[1:21:16] understanding you know I came to a place
[1:21:18] with the Lord where I actually lost my
[1:21:20] job and I've been on this job for nine
[1:21:23] years you know and I just thought they'd
[1:21:24] that company just couldn't make it
[1:21:25] without me
[1:21:26] and believe me they can make it without
[1:21:27] you they will show you that they can
[1:21:30] make it without you
[1:21:31] but you know it was in that time period
[1:21:34] and I've told many people this I'd go
[1:21:35] through it again tomorrow because it was
[1:21:37] in that 18-month period that the Lord
[1:21:40] filled me with the Holy Ghost but you
[1:21:42] know before I got the Holy Ghost I was
[1:21:43] in my basement one day and I was praying
[1:21:45] and I was asking the Lord to help me
[1:21:47] because it seemed like something that
[1:21:48] was just a block there and I just could
[1:21:50] not get through and the Lord had really
[1:21:52] brought me so far you know I wasn't able
[1:21:54] to work at the time and sometimes I'd go
[1:21:56] down to my basement not pray through
[1:21:57] four hours a day that's all I could do I
[1:21:59] mean I've outgrown my life crazy you
[1:22:00] know man's that maybe at home you know I
[1:22:04] was just praying and praying asking the
[1:22:05] Lord for help and and you know I really
[1:22:09] began to cry out you know I was I mean I
[1:22:12] was crying I wasn't saying I was
[1:22:20] screaming I was crying I needed to help
[1:22:22] from the Lord and something happened and
[1:22:26] I don't know to this day what happened
[1:22:27] but when I came to myself the first
[1:22:30] words I remember I said lord please
[1:22:32] I said forgive me for hating my father
[1:22:36] that's the Lord I didn't know I hated
[1:22:38] him you know and all these things just
[1:22:41] begin to out of my life all of these
[1:22:44] things come out of there you know
[1:22:45] because that was something that was
[1:22:47] keeping me from becoming what he wanted
[1:22:50] me to be and I had to I had to get that
[1:22:53] out of there now however it comes
[1:22:55] whatever happens God's gonna do
[1:22:57] something to bring those things out of
[1:22:59] your life and you know when I left
[1:23:02] Michigan I moved back to Virginia and
[1:23:04] that wasn't even a church down there I
[1:23:06] had to drive two hours one way to go to
[1:23:07] a church but I was so positive that
[1:23:09] that's where I needed to be even you
[1:23:13] know I had a pastor told me he said
[1:23:15] you're out of the will of God and I said
[1:23:17] listen brother I love you you know I
[1:23:19] said you'll always have a place in my
[1:23:20] heart you're the one that introduced me
[1:23:22] to this message and I said ah I love you
[1:23:24] but I said God told me to go brethren
[1:23:25] I've got to
[1:23:26] you don't even have a church to go to
[1:23:28] and I said I understand that but I said
[1:23:30] I'll Drive two hours to get to church
[1:23:31] you know I said I'm not gonna just give
[1:23:34] up and go home but that's where he told
[1:23:37] me to go and I'm gonna go so I did I
[1:23:41] started witnessing all of my family you
[1:23:44] know and I just I knew that God was just
[1:23:46] gonna bring everyone I mean never has
[1:23:48] brought any of men but it didn't keep me
[1:23:52] from witnessing him it didn't keep me
[1:23:54] from from staying in the presence of God
[1:23:56] holding them before the Lord and one day
[1:23:58] in prayer the Lord spoke to me he said I
[1:24:00] give you your father he said you'll
[1:24:01] baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:03] I come up out of that closet man I
[1:24:06] started telling everybody you know I
[1:24:09] said I'm up baptize my dad I said my
[1:24:10] dad's going to save don't baptize my dad
[1:24:12] you know I said the Lord doesn't give me
[1:24:13] my dad I mean I was just so happy I was
[1:24:15] telling everybody about it now that my
[1:24:17] grandmother's one day working for her
[1:24:19] which was my dad's mom my grandma
[1:24:21] Snodgrass and she said honey
[1:24:23] pray for your dad he pray for you dad I
[1:24:24] said mama quit worrying about daddy she
[1:24:26] said oh no he needs to be saved I said
[1:24:28] ma'am oh he's gonna get saved
[1:24:29] she said what I said the Lord doesn't
[1:24:31] give him to me I said the Lord told me
[1:24:35] I'm gonna baptize him in the name of
[1:24:36] Jesus Christ now my grandmother was a
[1:24:39] Baptist but she took across that front
[1:24:41] porch and she was screaming and
[1:24:43] everybody in that valley hurt hurt
[1:24:45] everybody around there hurt her and my
[1:24:48] grandmother stood on the banks of the
[1:24:50] river the Creek that we baptized my
[1:24:52] father in the name of Jesus Christ oh
[1:24:55] they meant and my father went on to
[1:24:58] preach the gospel for 17 years he's now
[1:25:01] in a nursing home from a stroke and he's
[1:25:03] not been able to get over but for 17
[1:25:05] years after that he went on to preach
[1:25:07] the gospel he meant no better sister I
[1:25:10] didn't have nothing in this Bible that I
[1:25:12] could go to but God gave me that work
[1:25:14] God gave me that word and it was just as
[1:25:17] real to me and just as strong in my soul
[1:25:20] and the day that we baptized him I
[1:25:23] brought him up out of that water and I
[1:25:24] looked at those people on the bank and I
[1:25:26] said listen if you've not been baptized
[1:25:28] in the name of Jesus Christ come into
[1:25:30] the water
[1:25:31] I said he's here to receive you today if
[1:25:33] you want it you don't want to be
[1:25:34] baptized in titles there's not gonna be
[1:25:36] a title that you'll be able to get
[1:25:37] through that door you gotta be born
[1:25:39] again you can only be born again when
[1:25:41] you come into fellowship with Jesus
[1:25:43] Christ praise the Lord now don't get me
[1:25:48] wrong wasn't nobody there that day I
[1:25:50] baptized up my father right but it was
[1:25:55] still word that God had given me and I
[1:25:59] never questioned you the first time I
[1:26:01] never questioned because God's Word
[1:26:05] don't fail raise the Lord so brother
[1:26:07] Jeff what about my kids and what about
[1:26:09] this and what about that go to him and
[1:26:11] you take the word that he gives you and
[1:26:13] don't you ever doubt it
[1:26:14] don't you ever doubt it you've got a
[1:26:17] sickness in your body call for the
[1:26:18] elders of the church let him anoint you
[1:26:20] with all in the prayer of faith shall
[1:26:21] save the sick not maybe not hope so
[1:26:25] they shall be sane praise the Lord the
[1:26:29] word doesn't fail business sister
[1:26:30] the reason the enemy wants us
[1:26:32] questioning the word is because he
[1:26:34] totally disarms us when we begin to
[1:26:36] question the work we put one mark on the
[1:26:38] word and the word can't have preeminence
[1:26:40] in our lives anymore raise alert we sit
[1:26:43] sometimes and you know we know we're not
[1:26:45] where we need to be with Lord and the
[1:26:47] Lord comes out he anoints your pastor
[1:26:49] and he just walked right up and down the
[1:26:50] avenues of your life and you sit there
[1:26:52] and you go he's gonna be so ashamed of
[1:26:55] me if I go up there I won't go up there
[1:26:56] that's the devil that's just the devil
[1:26:59] your pastor his life a pastor's love is
[1:27:04] unconditional just like God's is praise
[1:27:07] the Lord if it's not then he doesn't
[1:27:09] need to be a pastor raised alone right
[1:27:12] how do you think brother Branham could
[1:27:13] look into the lives of those people as
[1:27:15] they were coming across through there
[1:27:17] and still loved them enough to bring
[1:27:19] them into the presence of Christ when he
[1:27:21] saw things there he said many of the
[1:27:22] things that he saw what caused
[1:27:24] penitentiary offenses right but he would
[1:27:28] bring them through there and bring him
[1:27:29] into the presence of Jesus Christ I need
[1:27:31] to tell him I see a greater need here
[1:27:32] then what's in your body he said you're
[1:27:34] a sinner is it you need Jesus Christ in
[1:27:37] your life will you receive him today
[1:27:40] they wouldn't I don't ever remember
[1:27:42] seeing one that I've ever looked at
[1:27:43] anywhere that received Christ that
[1:27:45] didn't go away he'll praise the Lord
[1:27:48] they never questioned it because they
[1:27:51] were standing right there in his
[1:27:52] presence
[1:27:53] but what about some of the religious
[1:27:55] people that sat in the meetings and
[1:27:57] quite while he's guessing that he's
[1:27:59] guessing and he try and he said quit
[1:28:01] thinking that I'm not guessing I said
[1:28:03] you're hindering the service now stop
[1:28:04] that
[1:28:05] I was listed a plastic he said I'm
[1:28:08] fixing to call you out and he could have
[1:28:10] done it dude because he did it many
[1:28:12] times
[1:28:12] praise the Lord well what was it Satan
[1:28:16] there in the middle of God manifesting
[1:28:18] himself in a flesh body but sister
[1:28:22] that's what William branham's ministry
[1:28:24] was it was God manifesting himself in
[1:28:27] flesh now please don't misunderstand me
[1:28:31] it wasn't Jesus Christ the Messiah
[1:28:33] standing here that man was born in sin
[1:28:37] and shaping iniquity just like we are
[1:28:39] raised alert it had to be saved just
[1:28:42] like we do huh he had to have his walk
[1:28:45] with the Lord he had to be sanctified
[1:28:46] cleaned and set aside come on he had to
[1:28:50] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:52] brother Branham talks about over and
[1:28:54] over and over and one time he's
[1:28:55] preaching in a place and he said I'm
[1:28:56] very at home in here tonight
[1:28:58] he said I see that bar back there
[1:29:01] preaching what used to be a bar he says
[1:29:05] I'm feel very at home in here tonight he
[1:29:08] said because it was in a little black
[1:29:09] church or I received the baptism of the
[1:29:11] Holy Ghost a converted bar room so I
[1:29:14] feel very much at home tonight I'm glad
[1:29:16] to see that this is converted to a house
[1:29:17] of God if one of one of the preachers
[1:29:23] nowadays said well I feel very at home
[1:29:25] in a bar and boy we'd been trouble with
[1:29:28] me there'd be a vote first thing in the
[1:29:31] morning uh-huh well it's the truth
[1:29:37] he's a lord but you see it's the enemy
[1:29:41] constantly trying to disarm you we have
[1:29:44] been given a weapon that cannot be
[1:29:46] defeated if Satan can anoint us to
[1:29:50] question the promise of God then we'll
[1:29:52] bring an evil report these men that went
[1:29:55] over into the land saw the exact same
[1:29:56] thing that Joslin Caleb saw many of the
[1:29:59] men that walked with brother Branham
[1:30:00] they saw the dead raised they saw eyes
[1:30:03] created in sockets they saw leg
[1:30:07] straight now they saw God manifest
[1:30:10] himself in a way that had not been done
[1:30:12] since Jesus Christ walked the shores of
[1:30:14] Galilee and yet Satan would come up and
[1:30:16] make them question one thing and they
[1:30:18] turn and walk away from it just like
[1:30:20] they did with Jesus now I want you to
[1:30:22] think about this that was a part of
[1:30:24] God's plan a part of God's program
[1:30:26] because when Jesus in Chapter six there
[1:30:29] of Saint John rather man who made this
[1:30:31] statement he said when Jesus stood there
[1:30:33] he looked upon them and he said except
[1:30:35] you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
[1:30:37] you drink his blood you have no life in
[1:30:38] you this is a hard saying who commit and
[1:30:43] they said they turned and walked with
[1:30:45] him no more now brother Branham said
[1:30:47] Jesus looked out and saw a bunch of
[1:30:49] parasites hanging on him and friend you
[1:30:52] know the parasite is it lives off the
[1:30:54] life of a victim anything that lives off
[1:30:57] the life of a victim is a parasite and
[1:31:00] Jesus saw that those men were pulling
[1:31:03] virtue strength different things out of
[1:31:05] him that could go in to those believers
[1:31:08] that could help them that could make
[1:31:10] them more of what they're supposed to be
[1:31:12] I'm not you know I'm nobody's judging I
[1:31:15] don't want to be nobody's job it's not
[1:31:16] our time to do that there will be that
[1:31:18] time when we stand with the Lord as I
[1:31:19] mentioned earlier but this is not our
[1:31:21] time right now we need to fulfill that
[1:31:23] grace amen as long as there's breath in
[1:31:25] a person's lungs there's grace for their
[1:31:27] they meant but there are things that our
[1:31:30] prophet told us that when people do that
[1:31:31] they've crossed the line they have
[1:31:34] crossed the line we'll look if that was
[1:31:36] a parasite that was pulling strength
[1:31:39] away from somebody and God warning say
[1:31:42] let me just put it this way say that
[1:31:44] there was a church and there was
[1:31:47] somebody there under the inspiration of
[1:31:50] the enemy that was trying to move those
[1:31:52] people off of the word they were taking
[1:31:56] what should have been the children's
[1:31:58] bread and putting it before just
[1:32:01] trampling on it walking over it making
[1:32:03] the Word of God of no effect before the
[1:32:04] people you know making statements like
[1:32:07] why would brother Branham say that we
[1:32:11] don't live in a day like that now why
[1:32:12] would brother Branham make that's
[1:32:14] because he was an audit of God that's
[1:32:16] why he made that statement just like
[1:32:20] Elijah
[1:32:21] said let the glob that answers with fire
[1:32:23] peacock why did it why did he say that
[1:32:26] he was standing there against his own
[1:32:28] country his own countrymen but he was
[1:32:31] anointed of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:32] right that's a parasite a whole body of
[1:32:37] believers there that maybe would been
[1:32:38] pulled way out somewhere
[1:32:40] we know that the God's not going to lose
[1:32:41] a one but look at all the things that
[1:32:43] could be caused in their eyes all the
[1:32:45] things that they went through all the
[1:32:46] scars that many of them have all the
[1:32:48] distrust because a lot of those guys
[1:32:52] that do that are very anointed I mean
[1:32:55] they can put it together man they know
[1:32:56] how to work the mind you know many of
[1:32:58] them going to school you know gone to
[1:32:59] college and they've learned psychology
[1:33:01] and these different things and they know
[1:33:02] how to deal with the mind of a person
[1:33:04] I'm glad that you know I'm not dependent
[1:33:07] on God deal with my mind because I don't
[1:33:09] have much of one but you know I do have
[1:33:11] a heart that's tender I do have a heart
[1:33:13] that I want him to be the king of praise
[1:33:16] the Lord I don't want to question
[1:33:18] anything that he's doing if there's a
[1:33:19] parasite hanging on my life that's
[1:33:22] pulling strength out of me
[1:33:23] that could propel me into the arms of
[1:33:25] Christ I want that thing cut off I don't
[1:33:28] want anything at all in my life
[1:33:29] that's going to question what God is
[1:33:31] wanting to do I don't want to bring an
[1:33:33] evil report you celebrate you know your
[1:33:35] you don't have a you know if you're
[1:33:36] getting a pulpit you start saying bad
[1:33:38] things you know that no if I don't have
[1:33:41] the token applied I'm bringing an evil
[1:33:45] report no sister this is evening time
[1:33:49] this is evening time it's not time to
[1:33:52] question and wonder and how should we do
[1:33:55] this and how should we do that we've
[1:33:56] been given an instruction book come on
[1:33:58] look we're not in a foreign country to
[1:34:02] where when our prophet speaks it's got
[1:34:04] to go through 15 interpreters he came to
[1:34:07] our own land God brought him right out
[1:34:09] of the United States he speaks out well
[1:34:12] don't say he speaks English but then he
[1:34:14] speaks hillbilly he talks like I do you
[1:34:18] know what we call English you know he
[1:34:20] spoke it's not hard for us to understand
[1:34:23] what he said I know some of his
[1:34:25] terminology maybe people don't
[1:34:26] understand you know when I go to Africa
[1:34:27] some of the brothers I ask me what did
[1:34:29] brother Branham mean when he said
[1:34:30] grease
[1:34:31] what do you brother Branham mean when he
[1:34:33] said this or when he said this you know
[1:34:34] I grew up down in the hills I know
[1:34:37] exactly what he means it's not hard for
[1:34:40] me just like it's not hard for you to
[1:34:41] understand what he says but how would it
[1:34:45] be for you as a black brother you
[1:34:48] receive a high profit now how would it
[1:34:52] be for you as a white person come on
[1:34:57] Satan has never let that spirit die even
[1:35:01] in our message brother sister he's never
[1:35:03] let that spirit die he's always trying
[1:35:06] to raise that thing up it's us against
[1:35:08] them and it's them against us and it
[1:35:09] said if we're Christians friends were or
[1:35:11] one we are all worn together no matter
[1:35:15] where we're from brother sister Amen if
[1:35:17] we're children of God we come from God
[1:35:20] our skin may be different color we may
[1:35:23] have a different accent you know we may
[1:35:24] act a completely different
[1:35:25] some people are educated and some people
[1:35:27] are like me they just barely made it
[1:35:29] through high school I don't think that
[1:35:32] God really cares brother madam had a
[1:35:33] seventh grade education what he wants is
[1:35:36] a heart that he can deal with he can
[1:35:38] live in amen and an evil report if our
[1:35:42] life is not projecting what the word
[1:35:44] says it should project then we're
[1:35:46] bringing an evil report
[1:35:48] we're defaming what he wants to do for
[1:35:52] us he meant let me see if I can find a
[1:35:59] couple quotes here now some of you are
[1:36:05] getting getting tired but I'm not
[1:36:15] rather Bentham preached the message why
[1:36:16] it had to be shepherds it's 1964 he said
[1:36:20] notice they complained about God's
[1:36:23] provided way he said it was the reason
[1:36:26] that they died
[1:36:27] you mean complaining caused them to die
[1:36:30] that's what my man says well I think
[1:36:35] your brother Samuel would do it like
[1:36:36] this that brother Samuel be led of the
[1:36:39] Lord and then you be led to the Lord
[1:36:42] praise the Lord he said they complained
[1:36:46] that's what made them die in the
[1:36:47] wilderness
[1:36:47] they complained about God's provided way
[1:36:49] I business I want you to think about
[1:36:54] this okay we should consider it to be
[1:36:58] the greatest privilege that we've ever
[1:37:00] had for God to desire to come down and
[1:37:03] separate us from the world separate us
[1:37:07] from all these different things pull us
[1:37:09] out of denominationalism pull us out of
[1:37:11] darkness into his marvelous light we
[1:37:13] should be the we should really consider
[1:37:15] ourselves to be the most privileged
[1:37:17] people in the world but Satan will come
[1:37:20] and say well you know you would really
[1:37:22] be more on fire many times because of
[1:37:27] the sign that people are born under this
[1:37:29] Oh God
[1:37:29] am I not a Christian what am I not a
[1:37:32] Christian he said well Jeff that's not
[1:37:34] true why do we have an interview with
[1:37:37] sister Bruce that was recorded down and
[1:37:40] it was actually recorded by accident
[1:37:43] brother Rams getting ready to preach the
[1:37:45] masterpiece message he's in the office
[1:37:48] with sister Bruce the poor sister
[1:37:51] brother Brandon breaks it down in
[1:37:52] another message and talks about the sign
[1:37:54] that she was born under the different
[1:37:55] things here is a prophet telling her
[1:37:57] sister I've watched her life under
[1:37:58] vision if there was anything there he
[1:38:02] said as your pastor he said I'm duty
[1:38:04] bound to tell you that there's nothing
[1:38:05] there sister this is but brother Branham
[1:38:09] I make so many mistakes Satan because of
[1:38:13] the sign she's born under making her
[1:38:15] question brother man says mister Bruce
[1:38:20] that's what the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:38:24] hey anybody make a mistake today that's
[1:38:29] what the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:38:30] friend's brother sister I'm not talking
[1:38:33] about willful sin I'm just somehow
[1:38:35] making mistakes and we all do it but
[1:38:37] here's a sister that the Prophet the
[1:38:39] Prophet is telling her she's got the
[1:38:41] Holy Ghost and he's praying for her I'm
[1:38:47] gonna die if God doesn't do something he
[1:38:48] said sister you're not gonna die and
[1:38:51] she's still questioning because of the
[1:38:55] sign she was born on it because of the
[1:38:58] makeup that she has I know there's
[1:39:02] probably nobody here deals with that
[1:39:03] tonight but sister we all deal with this
[1:39:09] right here and the quicker we can bring
[1:39:12] that subject to the Word of God submit
[1:39:15] ourselves the sooner we're gonna be able
[1:39:17] to stop questioning those things brother
[1:39:21] Ben said if you really want to deliver
[1:39:22] and send your life he said just overcome
[1:39:23] that thing that that bothers you one
[1:39:25] time just overcome it once he said oh
[1:39:28] what a satisfaction what power what
[1:39:31] victory it gives you to overcome that
[1:39:33] thing and if you can overcome one thing
[1:39:35] well you can overcome the next thing and
[1:39:37] the next thing and the next thing and
[1:39:39] the next thing you know you're standing
[1:39:40] on the front line and you've got the
[1:39:41] full armor on and you're ready to meet
[1:39:43] every demon power you saw yeah it's just
[1:39:46] not that way it is it is the sister a
[1:39:51] preacher doesn't just learn you know
[1:39:53] because well God called me to preach
[1:39:55] hallelujah glory to god I'll tell you
[1:39:56] what I'm gonna do
[1:39:57] be careful that a man said a man has to
[1:40:01] learn to preach all right just like we
[1:40:04] have to learn to be Christians we have
[1:40:05] to learn to submit ourselves to the word
[1:40:07] and Satan's greatest tactic that he uses
[1:40:10] against us is to make us question thanks
[1:40:12] make us question was well what about
[1:40:15] brothers songs oh he was such a
[1:40:16] wonderful brother don't worry about
[1:40:17] brother songs I'll just keep going oh my
[1:40:18] god if brother saw himself belongs to
[1:40:21] God Satan can not get him we've got to
[1:40:24] have that kind of confidence but sister
[1:40:26] if that man belongs to God if that
[1:40:28] sister belongs to God something's going
[1:40:31] to bring them back we can't go in the
[1:40:33] rapture if they're part of that rapture
[1:40:35] until they're backed with
[1:40:36] need to be and if we got that kind of
[1:40:38] confidence with God and start praying in
[1:40:40] that matter with that kind of direction
[1:40:42] it'll change circumstances raised the
[1:40:44] Lord you know but my son came to prayer
[1:40:47] meeting Tuesday night he said dad I
[1:40:49] really want us to pray for this man that
[1:40:51] I work with he said his father has got
[1:40:53] to go in for emergency surgery tomorrow
[1:40:55] and I said well what's the problem and
[1:40:56] he said well they they told him that he
[1:40:57] had pancreatic cancer you know he went
[1:40:59] in for some tests and stuff and he had a
[1:41:01] date you know three or four weeks down
[1:41:03] the road but the doctors had called him
[1:41:05] that day and said he's got to begin here
[1:41:08] in the morning this is much more serious
[1:41:10] than what we thought it was and Joshua
[1:41:12] just put his hand on him and he said
[1:41:15] don't worry he said we're having prayer
[1:41:16] meeting tonight and we'll pray for that
[1:41:18] the man got in his car and took off went
[1:41:20] home the next morning at work he comes
[1:41:25] walking around got this great big smile
[1:41:27] on his face then he walks up to Josh and
[1:41:28] he said hey he said my wife just just
[1:41:31] text me he said they opened dad up
[1:41:33] there's no cancer there hey
[1:41:41] is that what does if I don't understand
[1:41:43] how that works I don't either but it
[1:41:44] works that's what matters I don't
[1:41:48] question how God's gonna do this just
[1:41:50] let God do it let God be God let him do
[1:41:53] what he wants to do the way that he
[1:41:55] wants to but the madam said they were
[1:41:58] complaining about God's one man message
[1:42:00] they were complaining about God's profit
[1:42:02] and that it caused them because of
[1:42:04] rejection of that leader it caused them
[1:42:07] to die in the wilderness he said tell me
[1:42:09] when God ever used a group to lead you
[1:42:11] won't find it in the Bible he said the
[1:42:13] word came to Moses and he said coral we
[1:42:16] all know he got himself all together and
[1:42:18] he complained about God not being just
[1:42:19] to do the thing that he did it to make
[1:42:21] one man with the message he said we're
[1:42:23] all holy I want to ask you a question
[1:42:26] where did he get that thought at Moses
[1:42:29] thinks that we're not holy Moses never
[1:42:33] said that the enemy planted that in
[1:42:36] their minds to make them think they were
[1:42:39] justified in coming against Moses well
[1:42:42] Moses thinks that were just not as
[1:42:43] spiritual as he is that's what it is he
[1:42:45] thinks we're not as high as he is like
[1:42:50] some people feel when they're listening
[1:42:53] to a tape and better Ben says look
[1:42:54] you'll never be any higher much a pastry
[1:42:59] praise the Lord
[1:43:01] the pastor can't bring you any higher
[1:43:04] and as he's there himself because the
[1:43:06] husband must be first protectors of the
[1:43:09] fruit he's got to move into that realm
[1:43:11] he can't give you direction on how to
[1:43:13] get into that realm unless he's there
[1:43:15] himself come on when brother Branham
[1:43:17] stood and told us about crossing over he
[1:43:21] wasn't making things up he'd been there
[1:43:23] he knew exactly what he was talking
[1:43:25] about another man him begin to describe
[1:43:28] Eve he wasn't making up a story he said
[1:43:30] I see her standing there in the garden
[1:43:32] he said the most perfect woman that's
[1:43:34] ever stood on the earth before he said
[1:43:36] her blue blue eyes and her blonde hair
[1:43:38] coming down her man said and I see them
[1:43:43] walking out of the garden brother
[1:43:46] Brendan said and say well let's think
[1:43:48] that maybe it was this way he said I see
[1:43:49] them but sister he wasn't just making
[1:43:53] things up when he
[1:43:54] told us about these things when mother
[1:43:56] BAM said we live in three three
[1:43:58] dimensions we live in like matter and
[1:43:59] time they sit down the fourth dimension
[1:44:01] he said that's radio and that's Airways
[1:44:02] never there now the fifth dimension that
[1:44:04] souls under the altar is those people
[1:44:05] have not repeating there that's where
[1:44:06] they go
[1:44:07] now the six dimensions where Christians
[1:44:08] go when they die in the seventh
[1:44:09] dimension is gone and you had people
[1:44:11] that were sitting out in there in the
[1:44:13] audience that had been in school all of
[1:44:15] their lives they're going I was talking
[1:44:23] to Perry green one time and he actually
[1:44:24] told me that there was a man in the in
[1:44:25] the meeting said he come to him and he
[1:44:27] says I don't know why this man says he's
[1:44:29] not educated he said this is a smartest
[1:44:31] man I've ever heard in my life
[1:44:35] but you see it wasn't his intelligence
[1:44:38] he was in another room when Jesus stood
[1:44:42] on the earth and he said father there's
[1:44:44] one thing I'd like to have he said let
[1:44:45] him be where I am he was standing right
[1:44:48] there with him mister brother branham
[1:44:56] didn't tell stories and he didn't
[1:44:57] project these things to us for us to
[1:44:59] talk about what a great messenger we had
[1:45:01] amen he had passed into that realm he
[1:45:06] was living under an eagle anointing he
[1:45:09] was flying above the nonsense the world
[1:45:11] did not affect him he lived it around
[1:45:14] with Jesus Christ and he was saying come
[1:45:16] up hither come up hither exactly the way
[1:45:20] the angel spoke to God and he said come
[1:45:22] up here and I will show you things that
[1:45:24] must come to pass here now look John was
[1:45:27] on the Isle of Patmos John was in the
[1:45:29] worst trial they've never been in in his
[1:45:31] life and there came the presence of guns
[1:45:33] that come up here a little higher with
[1:45:35] me it didn't take away Padma's but when
[1:45:42] he came out of there and went away from
[1:45:44] Padma's he never went back again came
[1:45:47] average history he never went back he
[1:45:49] never questioned what God had done for
[1:45:51] him he never questioned the revelation
[1:45:53] that he had been given but he knew it it
[1:45:55] comes straight from God he knew that
[1:45:57] that was what God's Will was for his
[1:45:59] children
[1:46:00] and he'd go back brother instead he said
[1:46:01] before the fifty little children love
[1:46:03] one another but John's love had come
[1:46:06] into a around
[1:46:08] come on read first John second John and
[1:46:11] third John and look at the way he writes
[1:46:13] come on just go to the Gospel of John
[1:46:16] and look at the way John writes compared
[1:46:18] to the way Matthew Mark and Luke wrote
[1:46:20] John wrote to the bride because he was a
[1:46:23] type of the bride he was in a different
[1:46:25] realm altogether
[1:46:26] hey man this bride is in a different
[1:46:29] realm all together brother sister hey
[1:46:32] man Silver's yeah life is so hectic in
[1:46:35] life is this enough
[1:46:36] that's the devil he's constantly doing
[1:46:38] something to get our mind off of what
[1:46:40] God's doing and look God can use that to
[1:46:44] mold and shape your character to bring
[1:46:47] you into that level that he wants you to
[1:46:48] be to bring me into that level that he
[1:46:50] wants me to be if I never had a trial I
[1:46:52] never had I'd never be able to tell
[1:46:54] somebody with good faith well I know a
[1:46:55] God that can deliver you well how do I
[1:46:58] know I never been delivered come on
[1:47:02] sister you know it's God in simplicity
[1:47:06] it's God in simplicity you know it's
[1:47:09] done I don't know what time it is but I
[1:47:11] gotta stop he's a lot he told me to be
[1:47:17] at home and this is what I do at home
[1:47:19] he's a lord let's bow our heads together
[1:47:23] tonight okay you're so easy to preach to
[1:47:26] God I mean you know I got a cute
[1:47:28] computer in front of me I preach to you
[1:47:29] all night but you know let's bow our
[1:47:31] heads together and let's think about the
[1:47:33] things that have been spoken because I
[1:47:36] know the Lord wouldn't put something on
[1:47:37] my heart or any other ministers heart if
[1:47:40] people didn't have needs I can tell
[1:47:42] right now not trying to be spiritual I
[1:47:44] don't mean it that way at all but I can
[1:47:46] just tell from looking on some of your
[1:47:48] faces as I preach the word some of you
[1:47:50] are dealing with those questions don't
[1:47:55] you just raise your hand to the Lord
[1:47:56] tonight and say Lord I believe the
[1:48:00] things that her brothers spoke up
[1:48:02] tonight Satan has tried to bring me an
[1:48:04] evil report Lord he's tried to defame
[1:48:07] you he's tried to take away the reality
[1:48:10] of just how real it is Lord he's tried
[1:48:13] to take away the things for me
[1:48:15] that'll give me victory in this hour
[1:48:19] evany father as we stand before you
[1:48:22] tonight Lord I certainly thank you for
[1:48:24] all that you've done in our lives Lord
[1:48:26] and I certainly thank you for the
[1:48:27] anointing of the Holy Ghost I realize
[1:48:29] father that coming into into a
[1:48:33] congregation of people and not knowing
[1:48:34] any person Lord and knowing that every
[1:48:37] one of us as human being has needs it
[1:48:39] pulls us back and forth all over the
[1:48:41] place sometimes Lord and brother branham
[1:48:43] even said one time and he said I'm not
[1:48:46] much of a preacher I can't hold a
[1:48:47] thought together but it really helped me
[1:48:50] because sometimes when that inspiration
[1:48:53] hits it's almost like I can't hold a
[1:48:55] thought together or but I believe if one
[1:48:58] of our brothers and sisters has got off
[1:49:00] the path I believe you'll get down off
[1:49:03] that path and you'll walk right down
[1:49:04] there beside them and bring them right
[1:49:06] back on the path where they need to be
[1:49:08] other as we stand here in your great
[1:49:10] presence tonight knowing knowing that
[1:49:12] you're more than able to do every single
[1:49:14] thing that you said that you would do in
[1:49:16] the world we submit ourselves to you
[1:49:19] tonight Lauren and we resist the enemy
[1:49:24] now Satan is gonna have to flee tonight
[1:49:26] Lord
[1:49:28] he's gonna have to leave these people
[1:49:29] tonight those that want to believe your
[1:49:34] word and those that know that their
[1:49:36] weapon is more than enough to defeat the
[1:49:38] enemy because this anointed word if the
[1:49:43] worlds were framed by the Word of God
[1:49:46] then that same word will defeat our
[1:49:49] enemy anywhere any place any time under
[1:49:52] any circumstance or the tonight Father
[1:49:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:49:57] ask that you just moved through the
[1:49:59] people art you see the things that
[1:50:02] they're dealing with in their lives and
[1:50:03] the questions that are there and many
[1:50:05] times Lord a man loses a job and he
[1:50:07] begins to question you know Lord what

[2:13:58] Lord Jesus of your word Lord truly your
[2:14:05] word Lord
[2:14:06] your words are spirit and life Floyd
[2:14:10] Lord Jesus there's not one person not
[2:14:15] one Lloyd that father could be able to
[2:14:18] walk out of here tonight and honestly
[2:14:20] say and you did not speak to them
[2:14:23] personally for Lord we know that God you
[2:14:27] never miss the mark but you speak
[2:14:30] personally to each of our hearts Lord
[2:14:33] Father we can go through many times I've
[2:14:36] thought about Lord as the brother was
[2:14:38] ministering tonight Lord to think it's
[2:14:42] something that just even where the
[2:14:44] Prophet was sitting there in the message
[2:14:46] go tell he had such a bad sinus
[2:14:49] condition and Lord you had already made
[2:14:53] known to him the first and second pool
[2:14:54] and he was walking within that but as he
[2:14:58] was in this situation he looked over
[2:15:00] sister median he said sometimes I wonder
[2:15:02] if I'm even called and Lord sister meet
[2:15:06] him she looked at him and said you ought
[2:15:08] to be ashamed of yourself to even say
[2:15:11] that for what God has done
[2:15:14] nor to think how that the profit he took
[2:15:16] that at that moment and you spoke to him
[2:15:20] when they could not bring the fever down
[2:15:21] they could not do anything to get that
[2:15:24] condition under control but you spoke to
[2:15:27] him and this is what you said I've
[2:15:29] already confirmed the furtherance of
[2:15:32] your ministry all you need to do is
[2:15:34] accept it and he said that I accepted
[2:15:38] Lord that's all he had to do he said at
[2:15:41] that moment not only did everything
[2:15:43] begin to change but he said the fever
[2:15:45] broke the sinus condition broke it's to
[2:15:49] accept what you have already confirmed
[2:15:52] to us Lord father no doubt standing and
[2:15:55] sitting here in this building tonight
[2:15:57] there's many hearts Lord God that have
[2:15:59] already been confirmed Lord God by the
[2:16:02] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:05] may we Lord Jesus rest within what you
[2:16:08] have confirmed Lord God other it's not
[2:16:11] the backing of an organization it's not
[2:16:14] the backing of a man it's the backing of
[2:16:16] Christ himself Lord Oh as we stand there
[2:16:19] as the Prophet said that little
[2:16:20] policeman standing on the street doesn't
[2:16:22] have no more power he couldn't stop a
[2:16:24] runaway Pony
[2:16:25] but he has authority Lord Jesus
[2:16:28] that's authority comes Lord by
[2:16:31] recognizing Lord who we are Lord Jesus
[2:16:34] that authority Lord where all heaven
[2:16:37] Lord is behind it Lord God because it's
[2:16:40] your word Lord and your fulfilling your
[2:16:42] word Lord in our lives lord what a rest
[2:16:45] it gives to us Lord you've not asked us
[2:16:48] to do anything but to have faith Lord
[2:16:50] you're the one who fulfills and you
[2:16:53] fulfill it in your way in your season
[2:16:55] and everything Lord and how that it's
[2:16:58] accomplished you do it all all that you
[2:17:01] ask for us is to believe Lord God and
[2:17:04] Father how what a rest that is to our
[2:17:06] hearts Lord
[2:17:07] I pray tonight Lord that you're God when
[2:17:11] we leave this place I know one thing
[2:17:13] Lord then I'm leaving here tonight
[2:17:14] closer to you than when I came in Lord
[2:17:17] Jesus
[2:17:18] I'm thankful Lord God for that because
[2:17:20] we we never leave out of here neutral we
[2:17:22] either live closer or we
[2:17:24] further wane Lord may there not be one
[2:17:26] tonight that would would leave farther
[2:17:28] away but Lord Jesus as you yourself the
[2:17:32] very answer of all questions have spoke
[2:17:34] to our hearts tonight we want to say
[2:17:36] thank you lord
[2:17:37] dear God we just ask that you would
[2:17:39] refresh your servant Lord father Lord

[2:17:48] and glory in the precious name of the
[2:17:50] Lord Jesus Christ amen and have been
[2:17:54] good to be here hey man you know I think
[2:17:58] of what brother Brahim said in the
[2:17:59] prayer letter when he sent that out they
[2:18:01] said brother Branham would would write
[2:18:03] them in there he says and what you have
[2:18:04] to do is he says you have faith in God
[2:18:06] and you begin to call those things that
[2:18:09] are not as though they are and they said
[2:18:12] and the other thing is is that you need
[2:18:14] to start doubting your doubts and just
[2:18:18] believe God's Word you know that's the
[2:18:21] I've just listened to it earlier this
[2:18:23] morning brother Bram said I like this he
[2:18:25] said this covenant that God made with
[2:18:27] Abraham he said he didn't include nobody
[2:18:30] else in it remember God would say before
[2:18:33] if you will I will but in this covenant
[2:18:35] God said I will I have already and that
[2:18:42] wonderful and that same I became flesh
[2:18:45] that same I is here in flesh tonight
[2:18:49] that same I am
[2:18:52] in a wonderful all blessed be the name
[2:18:56] of the Lord O my all we have to do is
