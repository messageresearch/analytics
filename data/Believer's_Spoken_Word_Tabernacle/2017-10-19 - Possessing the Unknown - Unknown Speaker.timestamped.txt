[27:28] [Music]
[27:36] [Music]
[27:42] Oh
[27:44] [Music]
[27:47] it's such a blessing to be able to have
[27:50] that request and that request is in
[27:53] trueness to have your way because that's
[27:57] the that's the real reality when
[28:01] redemption has come and God is restored
[28:04] and restoring us back into that
[28:06] relationship that fellowship where he
[28:09] communes with his children lip to ear
[28:13] that's a blessing it's it's by His Word
[28:17] by his character this is this that that
[28:21] very promise of John 5:19 I the son can
[28:25] do nothing but what do you see it the
[28:26] father doing that doeth the son likewise
[28:29] that is a promise that is reserved
[28:32] solemnly for the elect of God for the
[28:37] elect because it's God he reveals to his
[28:40] elect it's not something that we have
[28:43] made ourselves in that wonderful it's
[28:46] but it's God sovereignly that has chosen
[28:49] and it's God being able to communicate
[28:52] with his children amen in that wonderful
[28:55] Amen that is such a it's such a
[28:58] privilege in this hour and you know that
[29:00] that is the that's that's a thrust
[29:02] that's a goal of God coming back and
[29:05] becoming one of us is to restore that
[29:08] fellowship that we might have that true
[29:11] fellowship with him in that wonderful
[29:14] and you know in order for that to happen
[29:17] you see for God to be able to reveal
[29:19] himself it comes down to there must be a
[29:21] submissive life so God showing this with
[29:25] the submissive heart a submissive life
[29:27] and here this in here the promise is
[29:29] made manifest because how can God show
[29:32] himself to us if we're not willing but
[29:35] because there were because of that what
[29:37] I was the submissiveness it's what is
[29:39] there but it must be him bring the
[29:41] condition out so that we might walk
[29:43] pleasing it's all to his glory it's not
[29:48] of our doing it's all to his glory
[29:50] amen our election is not based on our
[29:53] choice it's his choice amen and it's
[29:56] God's choice being acted out we're just
[29:59] so so thankful it's just so good to see
[30:01] each and every one of you here tonight
[30:02] and I asked I asked brother Jerry the
[30:06] other day if he would just go ahead and
[30:08] take the service here tonight for
[30:10] Thursday evening I want you to also keep
[30:12] in prayer with the trip that we have
[30:16] coming up here to the Philippines we
[30:18] leave out on next Tuesday the Lord
[30:20] willing and we they had just been
[30:23] talking about some of the the weather
[30:25] that is taking place I guess the
[30:28] possibility of a typhoon coming in there
[30:30] in Japan and that's where we have to
[30:31] land first of all and I just received an
[30:34] email that let me know that if I want to
[30:37] you know take the tickets and do a
[30:40] weather waiver I can do that but I'm
[30:42] gonna wait on him because I you know I'm
[30:46] just resting in what I know what God has
[30:48] been brooding upon my heart so I just
[30:51] I'm just asking you if you just be in
[30:53] prayer that God because you know look
[30:56] God turned that that storm that was
[30:58] coming here in the States and where it
[30:59] was supposed to be such and it caused
[31:01] devastation that's true but it was not
[31:04] the category 5 when it came in like they
[31:07] said it would be it lessened that to a
[31:10] category 3 so let's just I ask you just
[31:12] to pray and you know look if it's not if
[31:14] it wouldn't be for God's will for us to
[31:16] go I'd be happy just stand right here
[31:18] I'd be happy but you know III just ask
[31:23] you to pray I believe I believe God has
[31:25] been orchestrating it all but we want to
[31:27] be in prayer for that also with sister
[31:30] Elizabeth Collins I didn't get a chance
[31:32] to some of you probably no doubt know of
[31:34] that and heard of it but when we had
[31:36] prayer for her here on Thursday and then
[31:38] many other Saints around the world
[31:40] brothers and sisters you know and it's
[31:42] just so wonderful coming together around
[31:44] the calls and around the need and you
[31:46] see where the sister the report I've got
[31:49] on Sunday is her her blood count was up
[31:52] and brother brother Collins had sent me
[31:54] a video you know of her
[31:56] the of the the walking and she's taken
[31:58] to the steps and everything that's been
[32:01] taking place her levels where the
[32:02] doctors had you know completely just
[32:04] given up to just come for care the
[32:06] levels have been restored she's back on
[32:08] to the lung transplant list and you know
[32:10] this is when things like this take place
[32:13] we don't want to recede with our prayers
[32:15] we're thankful for what God is doing but
[32:17] that it should also be at that time
[32:19] don't let it don't let it slip but let
[32:21] it intensify amen because we just don't
[32:24] want the Kings to lay there we want to
[32:26] take their heads off
[32:27] is that right we want to take their
[32:30] heads off so it's got to be a complete
[32:31] deliverance so let's just keep that in
[32:33] prayer for for her and just that God you
[32:36] know look however God is going to do it
[32:38] it's nothing for God but you know to see
[32:40] that in the midst of this time here how
[32:42] that God's faithfulness and God
[32:44] continues to move for our sister in a
[32:46] very special way and so let's just
[32:48] continue to hold to hold her up in
[32:50] prayer and looking to God just for a
[32:52] complete healing and just talked also to
[32:54] brother or brother Dave and sister
[32:57] Shirley today and sister Shirley you
[33:00] know just speaking with her they just
[33:02] wanted to say they certainly appreciate
[33:03] your prayers and you know she had had
[33:05] another setback it was going into last
[33:08] week so they had been a third time we're
[33:11] trusting the grace of God that they've
[33:12] got it right this time and you know
[33:15] above all things that the Lord would
[33:18] just strengthen her you know she said
[33:19] I'm a she said now I'm going back to the
[33:22] square one eight weeks I have to look
[33:24] look at things eight weeks again you
[33:25] know but she said within it all you know
[33:27] one thing about it when you call brother
[33:29] David sister Shirley man they encourage
[33:31] you he's like who in the world needs
[33:33] encourage here I mean they just man I
[33:35] get off the phone I'm charged I mean I
[33:37] think the lord have mercy I I called it
[33:39] just you know just to say hey we love
[33:41] you we're praying for you and man I got
[33:44] off the phone I'm encouraged
[33:45] you know you get off the phone you think
[33:47] where's the devil at you say for the
[33:50] same you what is that it's - it's you
[33:52] know friends what's glorious is the even
[33:55] that God would be that we would be able
[33:57] to be in a place to say Lord let my
[33:58] attitude be sweetened and be right in
[34:01] the midst of the test and of the trial
[34:02] that that is victory right there that is
[34:05] victory right there because as we look
[34:07] at and started looking at that on
[34:08] we got this little cocklebur apart but
[34:10] that wheat life on the inside that is
[34:13] the greater is he that is in us and we
[34:15] got a pool we got to put a check make on
[34:17] that cocklebur oh every once in a while
[34:20] because the wheat life never gets an
[34:22] attitude we live never gets one is the
[34:26] cocklebur a part of us that gets checked
[34:29] but the wheat life rises up in authority
[34:32] under the word it says get back here
[34:35] that's glorious amen
[34:38] well let's let's stand and brother Jerry
[34:41] we'll just invite him on amen I may
[34:45] believe that God knows what you have
[34:46] need of God knows what we have need of
[34:49] here tonight we have need of more of him
[34:51] we certainly have needs within our life
[34:54] and I believe that God is is here and
[34:56] present to direct the servant of the
[34:58] Lord to even form the words of what
[35:01] needs to be spoken to you and I for what
[35:03] we have need of what is it it's the
[35:05] great shepherd himself coming right
[35:07] among us and ministering to our needs in
[35:10] that wonderful that God can walk right
[35:13] among his children and feel free to walk
[35:15] right here among our lives this is what
[35:18] we want amen
[35:19] let's sing that song again have your way
[35:21] have your way and your way
[35:30] and you're let it be a prayer that can
[35:37] be a request Holy Spirit and have your
[35:48] [Music]
[36:02] [Applause]
[36:02] [Music]
[36:24] how look it's good to be back here with
[36:27] you in tonight and maybe it seems like I
[36:33] just can't stay away but I appreciate
[36:40] your prayers as was brother Samuel was
[36:43] saying for trip that we got going to the
[36:47] Philippines and I appreciate you keeping
[36:50] us in prayer while we're there and
[36:52] during our travels in the country there
[36:56] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[36:58] of Prayer Heavenly Father were thankful
[37:01] to be here tonight Lord we're thankful
[37:03] Lord that our confidence is in unity of
[37:06] God and not in ourselves Lord and not in
[37:09] any man but in you Lord Jesus Christ
[37:12] Lord we ask that you would move the Lord
[37:16] in our mist
[37:17] tonight there God may you anoint me in
[37:20] such a way Lord that I may follow the
[37:23] leadership of the Holy Spirit and
[37:25] thereby being able to be a help and
[37:27] extra thin until the people Lord we ask
[37:31] all these things and Naim and ask you to
[37:33] receive the glory in Jesus name Amen
[37:37] you term of being your Bibles to Hebrews
[37:40] chapter 11 and I want to read the first
[37:45] three verses there to start out with and
[37:49] to get a draw text from it
[37:56] now faith is the substance of things
[37:59] hoped for the evidence of things not
[38:01] seen for by it the elders obtained a
[38:04] good report through faith we understand
[38:07] that the worlds were framed by the Word
[38:09] of God so that things which are seen
[38:12] were not made of things which do appear
[38:15] you may be seated and what I would like
[38:17] to speak on tonight is possessing the
[38:21] unknown possessing the unknowing brother
[38:25] branham if you can remember the message
[38:28] of stand in the gap where the Braun was
[38:29] talking about how that he thought that
[38:33] he would be like the Old Testament
[38:35] prophets and he would just go out into
[38:37] the wilderness and wait until God gave
[38:39] him something to say to people and then
[38:40] come in and say it to the people and go
[38:43] right back out into the wilderness and
[38:44] God spoke to him and told him he said
[38:47] you're called to a higher calling than
[38:48] that of the Old Testament prophets he
[38:51] said you got an apostolic calling
[38:53] besides that said you have more gifts
[38:55] than they have they had and he's but the
[39:00] Lord asked him when he was talking to
[39:02] him about this he said why do you wait
[39:04] for me to move you every time you move
[39:07] where is your reward and brother branham
[39:11] explains that he was waiting every time
[39:14] for for thus saith the Lord before he
[39:17] would move and we think well how could
[39:20] that be a negative thing well he was he
[39:25] was waiting until God would more or less
[39:28] push him before he would go and do
[39:31] something and he then the Lord spoke to
[39:35] him also and he goes over it and
[39:37] standing up how he says you're like
[39:39] Moses you've lost the feeling for the
[39:41] people because brother Branham was while
[39:44] he was waiting on God to push him to go
[39:47] somewhere he was letting the sick people
[39:49] lay and the Lord remind him you're
[39:51] called to pray for the sick and brother
[39:57] Branham said that what it was he had
[39:59] built up a complex because that the
[40:02] people wouldn't hear or listen to the
[40:04] message and he would preach and and
[40:08] would come back it was like it had no
[40:12] but I thinking on that and I looked at
[40:16] questions and answers and I look at
[40:20] questions answers on the seals and I
[40:23] realized that by the questions many of
[40:25] the people had not moved up into the
[40:28] revealed word of that day and I realized
[40:34] that when God sends a prophet and he
[40:37] brings a message it's not only geared
[40:40] just right for that moment but it's for
[40:43] it's for all the people that will ever
[40:47] hear it of that age Paul what we know
[40:53] was a messenger to the envision age yet
[40:56] Paul didn't even live during that time
[40:58] but it was his ministry that after he
[41:01] was gone his ministry went on and
[41:04] affected and influenced that age the
[41:07] believers in that age God never sends a
[41:10] message what it doesn't accomplish a
[41:13] purpose he sent it for brother Branham
[41:16] goes on and standing in the gap and says
[41:20] I'm returning to the field older young
[41:24] live or die I will beg God until death
[41:26] shall set me free and then he goes on to
[41:29] explain how that there was not one flaw
[41:33] in ever in the ministry there was not
[41:37] one flaw in what was ever prophesied or
[41:39] said that it did not come to pass and he
[41:43] said the reason for that was I was
[41:45] always waiting on him but then he goes
[41:48] on this ad says but being on to the
[41:52] church here and to the church hereafter
[41:55] if God pushes a man through a pipe and
[41:58] he don't move it on until God tells him
[42:00] there is no faith connected with it if
[42:03] God it's God pushing you to do something
[42:07] and he says I must go out by faith I
[42:15] must do it by faith whether I think it's
[42:18] right or wrong or what I do the best of
[42:21] my choosing and then go
[42:23] do it because it hasn't been wrong I I
[42:31] don't know if you've ever faced
[42:34] something where you know we pray about
[42:36] everything we do if we're going to buy a
[42:39] house we pray about buying the house
[42:41] before we go to do it if we're going to
[42:43] buy a car we pray about it before we go
[42:46] to do it anything that we go to do
[42:49] specially major things we always seek
[42:51] the Lord's will on it we seek the Lord's
[42:54] will before we go some will be making a
[42:56] commitment to go somewhere and but I
[43:00] don't know if you've ever been in a
[43:02] situation where you asked the Lord for a
[43:05] sign of what to do and instead of giving
[43:07] you a sign the Lord says you make the
[43:09] decision I've been there where God just
[43:17] says you decide and then you think well
[43:23] how I know what decision to make you
[43:27] have to make the decision on faith
[43:32] brother Branham says here I read it
[43:35] again he says I'll do the best of my
[43:39] choosing and then go do it now when
[43:45] brother Branham was going back out in
[43:47] the field he wasn't going by vision he
[43:50] didn't get a vision but it was just the
[43:53] Lord's talking to him and showing him
[43:57] what had happened and where he was at
[43:59] and how he'd lost the feeling for the
[44:01] people and what is calling reminding of
[44:03] what his calling really was and by that
[44:06] brother Branham took the step by faith
[44:08] and went back onto the field say what's
[44:14] going to happen I don't know but faith
[44:21] in God will possess what you don't know
[44:28] faith possesses the unknown we realized
[44:32] God caused us to a life a walk of faith
[44:35] and faith is not something you can see
[44:37] taste hear or smell or feel but yet it's
[44:42] real it's not a guess or an assumption
[44:46] it's real you but you may not be able to
[44:49] explain it you can't see it you but
[44:53] faith possesses what you don't know at
[44:56] the moment
[44:59] say I
[45:00] I need healing I don't know I'm supposed
[45:04] to go to this doctrine I'm supposed to
[45:06] go to that and they're saying I need
[45:07] surgery for this and I don't know what
[45:09] to do
[45:09] faith will possess the unknown that you
[45:13] are able to put it in God's hands
[45:15] and say you know what I know that he is
[45:19] in control and I tell you this if you
[45:24] make a wrong move God will bring your
[45:27] footsteps back on to the right path but
[45:31] it is a walk of faith it's not a walk of
[45:33] knowledge it's not a walk of
[45:36] understandings it is a walk of faith
[45:42] faith doesn't concern itself with the
[45:44] details now I want to go back to Hebrews
[45:51] 11 and start at verse 6 and it says but
[45:56] without faith it is impossible to please
[45:58] him for he that cometh to God must
[46:01] believe that he is and that he is a
[46:03] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[46:05] Him by faith Abraham when he was called
[46:08] to go out into a place which he should
[46:11] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[46:14] and went out not knowing whether he went
[46:19] so what God called Abraham and called
[46:22] him to go forth and then didn't even
[46:23] tell him where it was going
[46:27] but Abraham had to walk by faith knowing
[46:32] that God would you God would direct his
[46:35] footsteps
[46:36] as long as you're standing still there
[46:40] are no footsteps to be directed but when
[46:44] you're moving then there's then God can
[46:47] direct the footsteps of the righteous it
[46:54] goes on to say by faith he sojourned in
[46:56] the land of promise as in a strange
[46:58] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[47:00] Isaac and Jacob and heirs with him of
[47:03] the same promise for he looked for a
[47:06] city which hath foundations whose
[47:08] builder and maker is God so Abraham was
[47:12] looking for a city he went for that he
[47:13] didn't know where he was going but God
[47:16] would guide him as he went on his way he
[47:20] had to walk by faith knowing that God
[47:23] said go God told him to leave where he
[47:28] was God told him to separate himself
[47:31] from from his family of course we know
[47:34] that it took the Lord taking the life of
[47:39] Abraham's father for Abraham to get
[47:41] separated from him and then it took a
[47:45] real falling out among the herdsmen of
[47:48] lot and the herdsmen of Abraham before
[47:51] he would part ways with lot but God
[47:54] wanted him to separate himself from all
[47:56] that and go forward and and as Abraham
[48:00] went forward like I said his first
[48:03] footsteps he took he still kept his
[48:06] father with him that was wrong
[48:09] so God guided his footsteps and got him
[48:11] back on the right path to where God put
[48:15] him to where he would separate did
[48:17] separate him from his father and he done
[48:20] the same thing with with concerning lot
[48:23] in the herdsmen and so forth that
[48:25] Abraham and made the decision to go
[48:27] forward and still carry a lot with him
[48:30] but God didn't want lot to go with him
[48:32] but the point is that Abraham went
[48:35] forward he might have made mistakes
[48:39] along the way
[48:40] but God wasn't looking at the mistakes
[48:43] cause God can correct that
[48:50] the mess of perfect faith brother
[48:53] Branham says perfect faith is a master
[48:55] of all circumstances perfect faith
[48:58] masters all circumstances no matter what
[49:01] it is it masters it now just watch when
[49:05] you're believing anything and doing
[49:06] anything you got faith in what you're
[49:08] doing no matter what the circumstance is
[49:11] they don't have one thing to do with it
[49:13] see it masters that circumstance that's
[49:18] how you can possess the unknown you take
[49:24] possession of what you don't know
[49:26] by faith knowing that faith will conquer
[49:31] every circumstance every circumstance
[49:35] you face everything that comes your way
[49:38] whatever stands in your way
[49:40] faith will master that circumstance that
[49:44] situation I know it's against our human
[49:51] nature faith is against our human nature
[49:59] and it's against the car carnal thinking
[50:04] and the Bible said that our carnal
[50:08] thinking was an enemy we get to facing
[50:15] something as as flesh and blood humans
[50:18] we we would like to know how is just
[50:21] going to work out
[50:24] give me some assurance that it's going
[50:27] to work out it's by faith you have to
[50:29] claim it but we want to know well how
[50:34] are you going to do it Lord like as if I
[50:37] will have more confidence if he explains
[50:40] it to us but God doesn't come down and
[50:47] reason it with us
[50:48] he has his way and whatever way that God
[50:52] is going to do it you will be the
[50:55] beneficiary of it
[50:58] if we if we could do it all way we would
[51:02] not be have any benefit at all it would
[51:07] be become a detriment to us he said if I
[51:15] was in the room of sickness and the Lord
[51:17] revealed a certain thing was going to
[51:18] happen you just speak it and go on just
[51:22] don't ask any questions it's already
[51:25] over just keep going see it masters the
[51:29] circumstances it's already got it
[51:33] mastered faith believes that God will
[51:35] work it out I don't know how he's going
[51:37] to do it but he'll do it anyhow it
[51:40] masters are all circumstances you know
[51:45] anybody can have can claim to have faith
[51:48] on the other side of the trial once
[51:54] you've come through it you can claim to
[51:57] have faith you can always claim to have
[52:01] faith when you're on the mountaintop but
[52:04] down in the valleys where you need faith
[52:07] going through the trial or the circuit
[52:10] that's where you need faith it's easy to
[52:16] give God the glory once you've come out
[52:19] on the other side of it but what we
[52:23] ought to be able to do is give him the
[52:25] glory why we're going through it knowing
[52:27] that he is going to bring us through it
[52:31] and he knows the best way to do it but
[52:36] see we get fearful and we let fear kind
[52:44] of grippers but brother Branham says
[52:47] faith and love is in a relationship with
[52:51] one another and the Bible tells us
[52:54] perfect love casts out all fear
[53:02] and he says faith and love works
[53:06] together so if we know that we have the
[53:12] right kind of love for God we know that
[53:15] he has the right kind of love for us we
[53:17] have that confidence then jesus said if
[53:22] an earthly father knows how to give good
[53:25] gifts to his children how much more
[53:27] would our Heavenly Father know how to
[53:29] give good gifts to his children
[53:35] sometimes you'll hear amongst perhaps
[53:41] maybe I've heard monks do nominal
[53:44] believers and I've heard among sinners
[53:47] that they would say well if if there was
[53:51] a God or if God really cared that he
[53:53] wouldn't allow this to happen he
[53:55] wouldn't allow these things that
[53:57] happened to children or he wouldn't
[53:59] allow these he wouldn't have allowed for
[54:01] death to come and take my loved one I
[54:04] don't have a thing to do with it one
[54:09] thing if you're not in Christ then
[54:12] you're not under the protection of the
[54:13] blood but if we're in Christ then we're
[54:18] under the protection of the blood and
[54:20] there's nothing can touch us unless God
[54:23] allows it we could look at all the
[54:29] things that happened to Joel and if we
[54:31] looked at him and tried to reason we
[54:33] would say how could any of that been for
[54:36] jobs good but what it did was it mature
[54:40] job spiritually
[54:43] and that's what's important your natural
[54:47] life is not what's important
[54:48] it's your spiritual life and your
[54:51] spiritual walk with God that's what's
[54:53] important pardon me
[55:12] back to Hebrews chapter 11 verse 13 says
[55:17] these all died in faith not having
[55:21] received the promises but having seen
[55:24] them afar off and were persuaded of them
[55:27] and embraced them confessed that they
[55:30] were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
[55:32] verse 17 says by faith Abraham when he
[55:37] was tried offered up Isaac and he that
[55:41] had received the promises offered up his
[55:43] only begotten son of whom it was said
[55:45] that in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[55:49] accounting that God was able to raise
[55:51] him up even from the dead from which
[55:53] also he received him in a figure now
[55:56] when God told Abraham to do this God
[56:00] didn't come down and say now Abraham
[56:02] this is what this is all about this is
[56:07] going to be a pre figure of Calvary this
[56:11] is going to be a pre figure of God
[56:14] allowing his son to be sacrificed for
[56:18] the sins of the people God didn't come
[56:20] down to explain it Abraham
[56:22] yet what Abraham was dillmouth Isaac was
[56:24] a pre figure of that Abraham didn't even
[56:32] benefit from the from the pre figure of
[56:35] it immediately it wasn't till he was set
[56:39] free and resurrected and set free from
[56:41] paradise Abraham went to his grave and
[56:57] he couldn't necessarily look at what had
[57:01] happened with him and Isaac like we can
[57:05] see it that is he revealed to us today
[57:08] God doesn't always explain what he's
[57:11] doing there's things that will happen in
[57:13] your life that could end up being for
[57:16] someone else's good
[57:22] but God didn't sit down and explain that
[57:25] to you he just goes ahead and does it
[57:34] proverbs 3:5 and 6 says trust in the
[57:38] Lord with all that heart lean not to
[57:41] thine own understanding and all thy ways
[57:44] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[57:46] paths
[57:49] brother Adam says in the prepper message
[57:52] of preparation he says don't depend on
[57:55] your knowledge and don't never try to
[57:58] figure anything out that God says if you
[58:02] could figure it out or I could figure it
[58:04] out worth but any other preacher could
[58:06] figure it out
[58:07] we would be equal with God we're not
[58:12] supposed to we're never will be able to
[58:16] figure it out because when we can figure
[58:18] it out it's not faith anymore
[58:20] we've got to accept it by faith is that
[58:25] right God said so I don't know how I
[58:28] can't tell you how he's going to do it
[58:30] but he's going to do it cuz he said so
[58:33] that's the basis God is going to do it
[58:36] because he promised he'd do it he's God
[58:38] and he can't break his promises remember
[58:44] says that's how it is and he says he
[58:51] goes on to say here and some of God's
[58:52] preparations has been so ridiculous to
[58:56] the people who depend on the tree of
[58:59] knowledge I don't want to be dependent
[59:03] on the tree of knowledge but if we're to
[59:06] if if we're leaning toward our own
[59:08] understanding and we're not able to
[59:10] stand there by faith in what we are
[59:13] leaning toward is the tree of knowledge
[59:16] if we think we come to us God will how
[59:22] you going to do it what we're actually
[59:24] doing is we're trying to go to the tree
[59:27] of knowledge
[59:29] God's not going to explain it to you
[59:34] because then it wouldn't be a walk of
[59:37] faith anymore
[59:38] you have to have faith he's gonna take
[59:40] care of your God doesn't come down and
[59:42] say now I am going to explain this you
[59:44] so that you understand that I am going
[59:47] to take care of you so you'll believe me
[59:49] because that's not how faith works we
[59:54] don't believe it because we see it we
[59:58] don't believe it because we understand
[1:00:00] it
[1:00:00] we believe it because we trust in
[1:00:03] Almighty God that's faith I mean not
[1:00:14] your own understanding he says if I
[1:00:15] could tell you how it was done then it
[1:00:18] wouldn't be no more faith I don't know
[1:00:21] how it's done I don't know but I believe
[1:00:23] it I know how God saves a sinner or
[1:00:26] excuse meaning we reread this he says I
[1:00:29] don't know how God saves the center but
[1:00:32] he does it I don't know how God does any
[1:00:37] of these things but I accept it that he
[1:00:39] does it and that's the way look at the
[1:00:44] people that brother Branham had to
[1:00:45] withstand that didn't believe in divine
[1:00:47] healing why wasn't they didn't believe
[1:00:50] in it because they didn't understand it
[1:00:54] they were looking to understand it
[1:00:56] instead of just accepting by faith that
[1:00:59] God is a God that heals his people
[1:01:08] because I can't explain it never will be
[1:01:13] able to explain it no one can because if
[1:01:15] you do then it's normal faith the Missis
[1:01:20] forgotten buta 2d goat he begins to talk
[1:01:22] about John the Baptist and how you know
[1:01:25] that John had when he was thrown in
[1:01:28] prison and he began to wonder is he
[1:01:32] really the Messiah or not and brother
[1:01:36] Branham talks about how he said that'll
[1:01:38] eagle his bill and his eyes they got
[1:01:40] kind of crusted
[1:01:41] / but he says here in the Forgotten
[1:01:45] beatitude he said so Satan was trying to
[1:01:46] get John to disbelieve so John got to
[1:01:50] his disciples together and sent him out
[1:01:52] and John thought could I have been wrong
[1:01:56] is he really the same one I know the
[1:02:00] sign was right I seen the messiah-king
[1:02:03] I know that was right but this meek and
[1:02:06] lowly and all this I don't get it I
[1:02:11] can't figure it up I can't make the ends
[1:02:14] meet with it well the man says you're
[1:02:18] not supposed to make the ends meet see
[1:02:25] John was looking at he thought he was
[1:02:27] going to come forth ferocious as a lion
[1:02:30] he was going to come forth in judgment
[1:02:32] and here he was meat and lowly John was
[1:02:39] scratching his head now I thought that
[1:02:42] it was going to beat this way and he was
[1:02:51] a prophet but he was human he was human
[1:03:00] so don't get down on yourself tonight if
[1:03:04] you've been trying it went struggling
[1:03:06] with this thing don't get down on
[1:03:08] yourself you're human but take
[1:03:11] encouragement from this you're not going
[1:03:14] to be able to figure it out
[1:03:18] you're not supposed to Jesus Christ the
[1:03:25] same yesterday today and forever he says
[1:03:27] don't doubt believe it take all doubt
[1:03:30] away from me don't wonder what if
[1:03:33] Abraham tried to wonder what if Jonah in
[1:03:36] the belly of the well tried to wonder
[1:03:38] what if all the other heroes of faith
[1:03:41] wondered how is it going to be think
[1:03:46] about it but they walked by faith not
[1:03:49] knowing what the outcome or how it would
[1:03:53] be they didn't become heroes of faith as
[1:04:01] we call him because that they understood
[1:04:05] everything that was going to happen it
[1:04:08] was because they possessed the unknown
[1:04:12] they took possession of what they didn't
[1:04:15] know by faith you don't take possession
[1:04:21] of it by it through understanding or
[1:04:23] figuring it out
[1:04:25] you take possession by believing that
[1:04:28] God is going to master whatever it is
[1:04:31] and that your faith is a master of that
[1:04:34] circumstance as long as you can figure
[1:04:38] it out it's not faith anymore it's got
[1:04:41] to be something you can't figure out
[1:04:47] it's got to be something you can't
[1:04:50] figure out because if you could then you
[1:04:54] wouldn't be walking my faith and that's
[1:04:57] the whole foundation of the believer is
[1:05:00] to walk by faith
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:08] Villa Brennaman myths of time-tested
[1:05:11] faith he says face is the substance of
[1:05:15] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:05:16] not seen
[1:05:17] he said now faith is not a myth it's
[1:05:21] something you actually possess then he
[1:05:25] give us an example he says like if I was
[1:05:27] starving and someone asked me what could
[1:05:31] I do for you that you wouldn't be
[1:05:34] starving said well if I could have some
[1:05:37] bread he said if they handed me 25 cents
[1:05:41] with the day that wouldn't get you much
[1:05:42] but at the time he speeds is that they'd
[1:05:45] hand me 25 cents he says then I have as
[1:05:48] good has got the bread because I've got
[1:05:51] the purchasing power of the bread he
[1:05:56] possessed the bread by faith because he
[1:06:00] had what it took to get it we possess
[1:06:05] the unknown by faith because we have
[1:06:09] what it takes to get it what is that the
[1:06:13] promises of God God said he would take
[1:06:18] care of us he said if he can take care
[1:06:22] of the of the birds of the field that
[1:06:26] how much more if he can take care of the
[1:06:29] flowers of the field then how much more
[1:06:31] could he take care of his children and
[1:06:34] he said he would never leave us nor
[1:06:37] forsake us not even till the end of the
[1:06:41] world so we don't have to worry about
[1:06:46] the world's ending or not
[1:06:56] and someone contact me it was one of the
[1:07:00] children that we had adopted they
[1:07:02] contacted me through a text message back
[1:07:05] when we were supposed to have that
[1:07:07] Eclipse remember that and they contacted
[1:07:10] me and said they think the war they
[1:07:13] thought the world was coming to an end
[1:07:14] and they were hoping they had time to
[1:07:17] get right and asked if they could come
[1:07:19] to church I never even responded you say
[1:07:24] he didn't respond no because I knew it
[1:07:27] wasn't sincere it was all about that
[1:07:30] Eclipse guess what I never heard another
[1:07:35] word from him after the Eclipse happened
[1:07:38] and went by and the world didn't end but
[1:07:43] just from what he said I hope there's
[1:07:45] still time for me to get right in other
[1:07:46] words I'm gonna ride out sin right to
[1:07:51] the end and maybe right at the end then
[1:07:53] I'll give myself to God that will never
[1:07:57] happen a child of God yet even while in
[1:08:08] sin once he is and knows of being saved
[1:08:16] and salvation he'll come he won't say
[1:08:19] well I'll just keep riding this one out
[1:08:22] and I'll come in right before it's all
[1:08:25] over
[1:08:28] no that's somebody who's enjoying sin
[1:08:32] and pleasure for a time
[1:08:41] brother Branham says here concerning
[1:08:43] what I was talking about he says well I
[1:08:47] haven't got the bread yet but I got the
[1:08:49] purchase power of the bread I might be a
[1:08:52] mile from the bread but I can be just as
[1:08:56] happy with that quarter in my hand as I
[1:08:58] can when I got the bread in my hand
[1:09:00] because I got to purchase power of the
[1:09:03] bread and when faith is anchored that's
[1:09:07] it's finished you're just as happy as if
[1:09:10] it's already jumping and the shouting
[1:09:13] because it's over he said you're just as
[1:09:19] happy going through it as if when it got
[1:09:22] over you know you'd be jumping and
[1:09:24] shouting it was over don't feel guilty
[1:09:28] about being happy once you come through
[1:09:30] something I'm not saying don't give God
[1:09:34] glory once you've come through it but
[1:09:38] let's be able to give him glory also
[1:09:40] however going through it I know we got
[1:09:46] that feeling that I know what that
[1:09:48] feeling of complete relief is when you
[1:09:51] come out on the other side of a deep
[1:09:53] dark trial but if by faith you can
[1:09:59] possess the unknown you can have that
[1:10:02] relief in the midst of the trial
[1:10:09] he said when faith is anchored it's
[1:10:12] finished you're just as happy as if you
[1:10:14] was already jumping and shouting because
[1:10:17] it's over you have it it's something you
[1:10:20] know you've got nothing can move it you
[1:10:23] never watch for any evidences or
[1:10:27] anything you just know you have it how
[1:10:33] many he's ever laid out of fleece before
[1:10:36] the Lord sure
[1:10:40] I imagine we probably all have it
[1:10:42] sometime another you know you think when
[1:10:46] Gideon laid out the fleece and when they
[1:10:49] said well let the let the dew fall on
[1:10:53] the ground all around but let the fleece
[1:10:54] be dry you think that had been enough
[1:10:56] for you but then he says well let the
[1:10:59] dew fall on the fleece and the ground be
[1:11:01] tried we don't need to lay out any
[1:11:05] fleeces before God I'm not condemning
[1:11:08] you if you have we all have but we don't
[1:11:11] need to look for any evidences we claim
[1:11:15] it by faith
[1:11:21] it says here in this message briefs in
[1:11:23] 62 said when you've got the key there's
[1:11:27] no fear there's no doubt there's no
[1:11:30] question you don't have to ask anyone
[1:11:32] else about it you know exactly you've
[1:11:35] got it in your hands you know what to do
[1:11:37] with it
[1:11:38] you know what the score is you know the
[1:11:40] door is going to unlock you've checked
[1:11:43] the levers and you know it's strictly
[1:11:46] the right thing the door is going to fly
[1:11:48] open when you throw the key into it now
[1:11:52] what I'm one thing on a planet says you
[1:11:55] don't have to ask anyone many times when
[1:11:58] we get to facing something our first
[1:12:00] thought is to talk to somebody about it
[1:12:05] you know kind of get what do they think
[1:12:08] about it or maybe when x we're looking
[1:12:14] for some sympathy
[1:12:21] because as a human your first thought
[1:12:25] wants to be why me why is this happening
[1:12:30] to me what did I do and when when that
[1:12:37] thought comes to me tonight then I
[1:12:39] always do think of Joel Joel didn't do
[1:12:43] one thing except deserve God's
[1:12:46] confidence in him as I was with Moses he
[1:13:05] says now Joshua and all his knowing that
[1:13:09] the command was great but having the
[1:13:12] assurance he could be fearless he could
[1:13:15] be what we'd call reckless as long as he
[1:13:18] was pointed the right way he might break
[1:13:20] up against a hill that would knock him
[1:13:22] backwards but he would he was headed the
[1:13:25] right way possessed me I don't go
[1:13:29] forward move forward God will direct
[1:13:35] your steps here he's talking about
[1:13:39] Joshua me bounce off this hill or bounce
[1:13:42] off that one but he's going to end up on
[1:13:43] the right path but then the reason is
[1:13:46] because he's not standing still so can
[1:13:56] the Church of the Living God would be
[1:13:57] reckless and fearless in faith if were
[1:13:59] pointed the right way for he said as I
[1:14:03] was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not
[1:14:07] fail you nor forsake you he never
[1:14:10] forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he
[1:14:14] would not fail Joshua and he will not
[1:14:17] fail us he'll be with us
[1:14:22] in that message of as I was with Moses
[1:14:25] brother branham is bringing out the
[1:14:26] point he's trying to get across this
[1:14:28] that that Moses in all of his life and
[1:14:33] author all of his mistakes through all
[1:14:35] of his failures there all of his
[1:14:37] breaking up and and and and things and
[1:14:41] maybe even blowing the wrong way at
[1:14:44] times but God was with him and that's
[1:14:50] what the point brother Branham was
[1:14:52] trying to get across he said as I was
[1:14:54] with Moses so will I be with you we make
[1:15:04] mistakes
[1:15:11] but he's still with us
[1:15:16] he corrects our steps I just read one
[1:15:20] place here a couple of weeks ago where
[1:15:24] brother Brandon was saying there is
[1:15:26] times that we will even willfully do
[1:15:30] something that's wrong he says does God
[1:15:38] disown us because of that no he says
[1:15:42] you're gonna get some correction but he
[1:15:46] says if your child he says my children
[1:15:48] would do it they'll go against the rules
[1:15:50] sometimes he said but they that doesn't
[1:15:54] make him not my child it just means I'm
[1:15:55] gonna correct them and he said that's
[1:15:58] the way God is with us see I say that
[1:16:02] because Satan is always right there just
[1:16:04] ed up see you knew you should have done
[1:16:06] that you knew better why do you think
[1:16:15] he's gonna forgive you now you knew
[1:16:18] better you know that's the definition of
[1:16:21] iniquity
[1:16:32] well we're children
[1:16:40] you're in the service of perseverant
[1:16:42] where the randomness is it's coming
[1:16:45] toward the end of the service and he
[1:16:47] says there's a lady sitting right back
[1:16:49] here to my left right here at the end of
[1:16:52] the road she's suffering with trouble
[1:16:54] with her ears do you believe God will
[1:16:56] heal you and make you well lady you
[1:16:58] that's looking at me you believe he'll
[1:17:00] heal your ears and make you well you do
[1:17:02] all right have you a prayer card you
[1:17:05] don't have a prayer card well you don't
[1:17:07] need one
[1:17:09] see that's the unknown faith that you
[1:17:13] have you didn't even expect it hardly
[1:17:18] but faith is a hidden thing so your
[1:17:22] faith can go beyond your natural
[1:17:27] awareness and make connection with God
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:39] 2nd Corinthians 4 and 18 says while we
[1:17:42] look not at things which are seen but at
[1:17:46] things which are not seen were the
[1:17:48] things which are seen are temporal but
[1:17:50] the things which are not seen are
[1:17:52] eternal we can possess what we can't see
[1:18:00] we can possess what we can't feel that's
[1:18:05] what we mean when we say we're not going
[1:18:07] by emotions that's not to say we're
[1:18:12] emotional is whether we're not supposed
[1:18:16] to show any emotion but we we don't live
[1:18:21] our life by emotions if we came into
[1:18:28] church and decided whether we were going
[1:18:32] to enter into the song service or not
[1:18:33] based on whether we feel like it how
[1:18:35] often would we not be entering into the
[1:18:37] song service
[1:18:45] but we do it because he's worthy not
[1:18:47] because we feel like he's worthy of our
[1:18:52] praise whether we human ly feel like
[1:18:55] doing it or not amen
[1:19:06] I've seen people that maybe have trouble
[1:19:10] with their legs and interest if you have
[1:19:13] them standing up a wild than they they
[1:19:15] have trouble 'take a sit down that's not
[1:19:18] disrespectful but if you're asked to
[1:19:21] stand and you stay in your seat and you
[1:19:23] you actually can physically get up then
[1:19:26] that's disrespectful - whoo - god I'm
[1:19:33] gonna have you stand at the end of
[1:19:34] service the same standing sings well I'm
[1:19:42] not really feeling the anointing right
[1:19:44] now brother Jerry
[1:19:51] singing anyhow hey man if you could only
[1:19:57] worship God when you're having a good
[1:19:58] feeling while he's not getting the glory
[1:20:01] from it brother Brennan was asked a
[1:20:08] question he talked about this and
[1:20:09] looking to the unseen he was asked a
[1:20:11] question the woman rode him and said
[1:20:13] that she had been in a prayer line and
[1:20:15] have been prayed for and healed of
[1:20:17] cancer and she said that that for the
[1:20:20] first two to three days she was feeling
[1:20:23] good but then after on the third date
[1:20:26] she she became very feeling very off on
[1:20:32] her stomach upset and and all these
[1:20:34] things that she said is you have I lost
[1:20:37] my healing and brother branham tortoises
[1:20:41] know that's a perfect sign that you have
[1:20:42] your healing and I says God can perform
[1:20:47] a miracle I've seen him do it and heal
[1:20:50] someone of cancer and the dirt and the
[1:20:52] growth just instantly disappear but
[1:20:57] divine healing is to accept it by faith
[1:20:59] and that life dies he says that growth
[1:21:04] has a life in it a demon and when the
[1:21:07] demons cast out of it then that dies and
[1:21:10] now you've got a hunk of dead flesh and
[1:21:13] sure you're gonna feel sick
[1:21:15] cuz you got something there that don't
[1:21:17] belong there he said that's a sure sign
[1:21:20] that you're healed that's divine healing
[1:21:25] I know we would prefer the miracle but
[1:21:39] faith you know a lot of people say well
[1:21:42] it takes it takes a lot of faith to have
[1:21:44] a miracle no but it takes more faith for
[1:21:47] divine healing listen to this this is a
[1:21:56] message called the second miracle
[1:21:58] preaching 51 he says some people has
[1:22:02] great faith like this and anything can
[1:22:04] happen the next has faith that deep and
[1:22:07] it takes a little longer
[1:22:08] the next has faith that deep and it
[1:22:10] takes a little while some has faith like
[1:22:13] a mustard seed but if it's mustard seed
[1:22:15] faith genuine faith hold on to it just
[1:22:19] keep believing it it'll become Marvel
[1:22:22] faith and then it'll become great fruit
[1:22:24] faith and then to become Mountain faith
[1:22:27] it'll brand-new right out if you'll stay
[1:22:30] with it Satan will bombard you and he'll
[1:22:38] send you jobs comforters at times to try
[1:22:41] to discourage your faith but brother I'm
[1:22:46] saying even if you feel like your faith
[1:22:48] is real small just keep holding on to it
[1:22:51] it'll grow and he'll bring it'll brand
[1:22:54] you through it hold on to it it'll bring
[1:22:58] you right straight to the light if
[1:23:00] you'll stay with it don't be discouraged
[1:23:03] and don't believe symptoms symptoms
[1:23:07] that's the devil's lie a man symptoms is
[1:23:15] the devil wide
[1:23:23] it surprises me sometimes when I've run
[1:23:26] across people who have their medical
[1:23:30] books you know they don't have a degree
[1:23:34] they just got this medical big old
[1:23:37] medical book you know oh I've got this
[1:23:40] symptom let me look that up all my look
[1:23:42] what I've got
[1:23:44] don't claim that stuff don't go by them
[1:23:48] symptoms
[1:23:55] Jonas says talks about lying vanities
[1:24:01] that's what it is
[1:24:03] lying vanities an axe 20 and 22
[1:24:17] Paul says and now behold I go bound in
[1:24:23] the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing
[1:24:25] the things that shall befall me they're
[1:24:28] saved that the Holy Ghost witnesses in
[1:24:31] every city saying that bonds and
[1:24:34] afflictions abide me but none of these
[1:24:37] things move me neither count on my life
[1:24:40] dear unto myself so that I might finish
[1:24:44] my course with joy and the Ministry
[1:24:45] which I have received of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:48] to testify of the gospel of the grace of
[1:24:51] God now Paul says he went for it not
[1:24:57] knowing the things that was going to
[1:24:59] befall him if you read about this in the
[1:25:04] book of Acts you'll see that Paul goes
[1:25:06] forward and then he goes into Jerusalem
[1:25:09] and while he's in Jerusalem witnessing
[1:25:14] of the Lord the Jews said about to kill
[1:25:18] him and a captain comes by with his
[1:25:23] troops and takes pause and this one
[1:25:25] asked him to be bound and changed and
[1:25:28] says what is this man accused of and
[1:25:33] then Paul is delivered from one to
[1:25:37] another and then the captain they're
[1:25:40] going to have him scourged and Paul then
[1:25:45] says you can't scourge me because I'm a
[1:25:48] Roman citizen and then the Lord speaks
[1:25:54] to him and says as you have testified of
[1:25:58] me in Jerusalem so shall you testify and
[1:26:02] witness of me in Rome but see Paul went
[1:26:07] forward not knowing these things were
[1:26:09] going to happen but he said the Holy
[1:26:11] Ghost gave witness and as you read
[1:26:13] through those next following chapters
[1:26:17] you'll see that there was different ones
[1:26:20] where Paul went and dwelt with him a few
[1:26:22] days that they'd said bad things were
[1:26:26] going to happen and Paul even told him
[1:26:29] here he says this will be the last time
[1:26:30] you seem
[1:26:31] face but Paul said he wasn't moved by
[1:26:36] any of that because he knew he Paul was
[1:26:40] going forward believing that he was
[1:26:42] supposed to go to Jerusalem not knowing
[1:26:47] what all would happen and there was Otis
[1:26:51] said something bad is gonna happen Paul
[1:26:53] don't go and they tried to persuade him
[1:26:55] not to go but Paul says I'm not moved by
[1:26:58] any of that he went anyway because Paul
[1:27:03] felt to go and give witness of Jesus
[1:27:06] Christ when Paul got there Paul begins
[1:27:09] to tell them how he met the Lord Jesus
[1:27:13] on the road to Damascus how he appeared
[1:27:17] to him in a great light and how Ananias
[1:27:19] was sent to pray for him and laid hands
[1:27:22] on him and he received his sight Paul
[1:27:25] give us this testimony and witness of
[1:27:27] Jesus Christ changing his life and the
[1:27:35] Jews sought to kill him for it murder
[1:27:38] Paul taught him he says I'm a Pharisee
[1:27:40] of Pharisees the Bible says this caused
[1:27:45] much dissension between the Pharisees
[1:27:46] and Sadducees because you know the
[1:27:48] Sadducees they didn't believe in the
[1:27:50] resurrection that's why they were sad
[1:27:53] you see the Pharisees they did believe
[1:27:59] in the resurrection at least so they
[1:28:00] were fair you see but it caused
[1:28:07] dissension among them and then Paul
[1:28:10] talked how that he had been schooled at
[1:28:13] the feet of humility in the law and all
[1:28:15] these things but see they thought Paul
[1:28:17] now the very ones that he was
[1:28:19] persecuting paul says i persecuted them
[1:28:22] i was there with the martyr Stephen I
[1:28:24] held the the coats of the ones that
[1:28:29] stoned him he said but now I am turn to
[1:28:35] testify of him
[1:28:39] the devil didn't like that remember when
[1:28:47] he was there with that captain and and
[1:28:49] the Jews were gonna hast they they got
[1:28:52] about forty of them together and said
[1:28:56] plotted that and made a vow that they
[1:29:00] would not eat until they had killed Paul
[1:29:05] and Paul's sisters son found out about
[1:29:12] the plot and came in told Paul and Paul
[1:29:15] directed him to go tell the captain
[1:29:20] because they were going to ask the
[1:29:22] captain to bring him forth that he give
[1:29:25] testimony and then they were gonna kill
[1:29:28] him when I was there but see the Lord
[1:29:30] was watching out over all of this
[1:29:37] conflict between God and Satan brother
[1:29:42] Branham says what if Abraham had been
[1:29:45] asked what the doctors would come and
[1:29:48] say Abraham you're a hundred years old
[1:29:50] your wife's ninety how are you going to
[1:29:52] have a baby he says what if Abraham and
[1:29:55] said well I've got an understanding of
[1:29:58] this now we're going to drink a certain
[1:30:01] thing and then after we drink it then
[1:30:04] it's gonna make an effect in our bodies
[1:30:06] and then where he says no he said
[1:30:08] Abraham would answer to something like
[1:30:09] this I don't know no more than you know
[1:30:13] but one thing I know he said we were
[1:30:16] going to so I believed him
[1:30:19] [Applause]
[1:30:28] continuing for the faith the RAM says
[1:30:31] God is to be received by faith not by
[1:30:34] knowledge you might read the word
[1:30:37] through and know every word of it and
[1:30:39] still being lost I could say the same
[1:30:46] thing about the message of the hour they
[1:30:49] could be able to know the message of an
[1:30:51] hour and build a quote that probably
[1:30:53] said this and the Prophet said that and
[1:30:54] the Prophet said this and still be lost
[1:31:00] because just like people do with the
[1:31:05] Bible they can take and twist things
[1:31:07] whether Adam said and put their own
[1:31:09] slant and interpretation on it I'm going
[1:31:13] to do that that's certain death you
[1:31:20] can't figure it out it's my faith are
[1:31:22] you saved and that through grace not of
[1:31:25] works lest any man should boast and the
[1:31:32] message of Moses preached in 1950
[1:31:39] brother Branham says maybe there's some
[1:31:41] of it you do not understand frankly
[1:31:44] friends there's much of it I do not
[1:31:45] understand I just accept it don't never
[1:31:49] try to figure God out you can't do it
[1:31:51] God's not understood by knowledge God is
[1:31:54] understood by faith is that right what
[1:32:00] if Peter would have tried to figure out
[1:32:02] how deep the water was how impossible it
[1:32:06] was for him to walk on the water he
[1:32:08] never would have walked see but he just
[1:32:12] took Christ at his word and walked on
[1:32:14] and you just take him at his word
[1:32:17] tonight and if you maybe be a sinner and
[1:32:21] don't understand how to take God at His
[1:32:23] Word then God sent me here and I want
[1:32:27] you to take my word for it
[1:32:29] and see if it doesn't come to pass that
[1:32:31] God
[1:32:35] take my word for it what God sent me
[1:32:39] here for you to be healed
[1:32:46] I like this brother branham talks about
[1:32:52] a man they called him Mose and he said
[1:32:57] Moses carried his Bible everywhere he
[1:32:59] went and said if people would make fun
[1:33:02] even say Mose you can't read it why are
[1:33:03] you carrying he said cause I believe it
[1:33:10] he couldn't read the Bible but he
[1:33:12] believed it that's faith and so they to
[1:33:17] make further fun and they said well what
[1:33:19] if he would tell you to jump through
[1:33:21] that brick wall what would you do
[1:33:24] he said I jumped they said well how'd
[1:33:27] you gonna get through it he said I'd
[1:33:29] jump he'd make the hole and I got there
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:36] brother Brown goes on to say he says so
[1:33:39] that's the thing we have to do is take
[1:33:41] God and believe it jump anyhow if you
[1:33:44] could explain it understand it it
[1:33:46] wouldn't be faith no more faith is the
[1:33:48] substance of things hoped for the
[1:33:49] evidence of things not seen
[1:33:51] you don't see it you can't figure it out
[1:33:54] there's no way to figure it out you just
[1:33:56] got to believe him and keep walking on
[1:33:58] he said so that's how I stand in the
[1:34:01] pulpit for the visions he tells me to do
[1:34:04] certain things that seems humanly
[1:34:05] impossible and you all know that it's
[1:34:09] humanly impossible but he said do it
[1:34:11] just go on he's the one to take care of
[1:34:14] it and he'll do it How Great Thou art
[1:34:24] there was a man brother Branham talks
[1:34:27] about that his son was in the hospital
[1:34:28] dying and they had took the the
[1:34:34] cardiogram and the way that it
[1:34:39] registered they said there's no hope for
[1:34:40] him and the doctors telling the father
[1:34:45] this
[1:34:46] but the father would just seem to be
[1:34:49] joyous and happy and the nurse then as
[1:34:52] the doctor went out the nurse essence I
[1:34:54] I'm afraid you didn't understand what
[1:34:56] the doctor said he said no I understand
[1:35:00] what the doctor said she says well I've
[1:35:02] never seen anyone that this shows up
[1:35:06] this low on this raft and then live he
[1:35:09] says we'll see there's the problem
[1:35:11] you're looking at that cardiogram he
[1:35:14] said but I'm looking at the promises of
[1:35:16] God and my son is going to be healed you
[1:35:24] know there was brother Brandon talks
[1:35:27] about this and standing in the gap there
[1:35:31] was a service that he had many of you
[1:35:33] heard about it brother Wei was there him
[1:35:37] and his wife I had I had privilege to
[1:35:43] meet them when I was a boy
[1:35:45] and hear his testimony brother waist
[1:35:48] testimony but they were there in the
[1:35:52] service and brother Wei just fell out
[1:35:54] into the floor he died right there and
[1:35:58] brother Branham was quieted the people
[1:36:02] and walked down from the platform down
[1:36:04] there and began to pray for brother Wei
[1:36:06] and he was asking God to be merciful to
[1:36:09] him but the venom says in another place
[1:36:11] that brother Wei it took a wrong
[1:36:14] attitude concerning something that he'd
[1:36:16] said and that's why that it happened but
[1:36:18] he was asking God to be merciful to him
[1:36:20] and God raised him back up I not that I
[1:36:28] could compare to anything such as that
[1:36:30] but I remember one time and it got this
[1:36:34] got me to thinking about it that we were
[1:36:38] sitting in our living room and my son
[1:36:41] Nathaniel had this little kitten and it
[1:36:46] was just young I don't know how old it
[1:36:49] was but it was about yay big you know
[1:36:51] and it was there had been playing in the
[1:36:55] floor and we had a couple brothers from
[1:36:58] the church
[1:36:58] was over visiting with us and all of a
[1:37:01] sudden the kitten just fell over dead in
[1:37:03] the floor and Mina hollered at me real
[1:37:07] quick she said don't let that cat die in
[1:37:09] front of the children
[1:37:10] and so I've knelt down and scooped the
[1:37:14] kitten up and I didn't know whether to
[1:37:17] take it out of the room or what to do
[1:37:19] and then I thought I'm gonna pray for it
[1:37:23] and as soon as I went to go pray for it
[1:37:28] a thought
[1:37:29] bombarded me and said you prayed for
[1:37:33] your dog and it died anyway God didn't
[1:37:35] raise it up I had this dog I know that I
[1:37:40] pulled off but I love very dearly and we
[1:37:45] took him for surgery and she ended up
[1:37:47] when we got her home she had a blood
[1:37:49] clot that wouldn't killed her and I I
[1:37:51] sit in the floor with that dog of my
[1:37:54] life just crying and crying and begging
[1:37:55] God to bring her back but it didn't
[1:38:00] happen and so this thought bombarded me
[1:38:05] to remind me of that and then it said
[1:38:09] you're just gonna embarrass yourself in
[1:38:11] front of these brothers Church so then
[1:38:18] then there was another thought kind of
[1:38:20] me said what would brother branham do
[1:38:25] and you know what I said he would just
[1:38:28] believe so I didn't pray I just believed
[1:38:33] and set the kitten down and it came back
[1:38:35] to life
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:46] just believe that's all you got to do to
[1:38:52] possess the unknowing it's just believe
[1:38:55] Satan will always be there to try to
[1:38:59] bring doubt but here's the thing
[1:39:04] don't the well on the thoughts that he
[1:39:07] gives you
[1:39:08] they're always negative you can always
[1:39:10] pick it out then it's not God and don't
[1:39:13] think it's your own reasoning it's Satan
[1:39:16] trying to get you to reason don't reason
[1:39:19] with him amen
[1:39:21] we walk by faith not by sight amen we
[1:39:27] possess the unknown by faith amen
[1:39:30] hallelujah god bless you let's stand
[1:39:53] what if we could sing that song looking
[1:39:55] for a city no gee dad always something
[1:40:02] here go to the course
[1:40:22] no that's not the song that I was
[1:40:24] thinking of looking for a city where

[1:40:38] billions never

[1:42:38] to appreciate the world award tonight
[1:42:45] God was come how to come down and shakey
[1:42:47] Dhoni
[1:42:49] was how to come down you know I so many
[1:42:52] times a year year brother branham and I
[1:42:54] always loved that part over the years as
[1:42:55] I listened to message invisible Union I
[1:42:57] always loved the prayer requests with
[1:43:00] bream said Lord come search our hearts
[1:43:02] tonight and he said Lord don't leave my
[1:43:04] heart out search mine too Lord this this
[1:43:11] is truly when you you think of the word
[1:43:14] and how that God has spoke to us tonight
[1:43:16] the word has search this out it's a word
[1:43:19] that encourages and strengthen us it's a
[1:43:21] word that divides it's the only thing
[1:43:25] that can divide you from you is the word
[1:43:28] it brings a separation it brings
[1:43:31] encouragement amen because the enemy is
[1:43:34] always there is the things that brother
[1:43:37] Jared mentioned where he would come and
[1:43:39] you inspire and try to speak through
[1:43:41] that flesh and then he turns right
[1:43:43] around and wants to bring condemnation
[1:43:44] and he is the inspirer behind all of
[1:43:48] that I believe the Word of God is very
[1:43:50] clear to us casting down those thoughts
[1:43:53] you can always tell when it's when it's
[1:43:56] a thought from the enemy it wants to
[1:43:59] trouble you God's thoughts don't trouble
[1:44:02] you they direct you understand God's the
[1:44:07] God's thoughts do not put you in a place
[1:44:09] and trouble you but the enemy that's his
[1:44:13] objective to put you in a place like
[1:44:15] that but God's thoughts are always that
[1:44:18] of leadership it can point where we are
[1:44:21] and where we need to be and His grace to
[1:44:23] lead us all the way you know I just was

[1:44:49] years

[1:44:54] that we have a hold of it's what has a
[1:44:57] hold of us to where that we don't know
[1:44:59] in the midst of everything how
