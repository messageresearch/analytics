[32:09] Lord and the father there's no mountain
[32:12] there's no circumstance that's beyond

[32:16] and frankly Lord as a Believer you spoke
[32:20] to us if thou can'tst believe nothing
[32:24] shall be impossible to you
[32:28] Lord your Prophet would remind us of

[33:21] God bless you
[33:22] it's good to be here tonight isn't it
[33:25] and so good to be in the house of the
[33:26] Lord and
[33:28] as you're turning to Job chapter 23
[33:29] appreciate
[33:31] song leading the musicians and just the
[33:34] atmosphere that a man has created
[33:37] it's just um it's very it's very sweet
[33:41] it's very peaceful and the friends of
[33:43] God and as he comes and that's so good
[33:46] to see each one of you and some that
[33:49] have been out and back in brother Rocco
[33:51] is good to have brother Rocco back here
[33:52] with us and and so uh you know we
[33:55] sometimes we fight battles of sickness
[33:58] and things in our body and different
[33:59] ones that I know as we we go through
[34:02] that but God is faithful amen through it
[34:05] all and uh just really enjoyed the
[34:08] service on Sunday evening if you haven't
[34:10] had a chance uh you say I'm not a young
[34:12] person that that service you you could
[34:15] it doesn't matter you that service could
[34:17] be preached it could be preached to 80
[34:19] year olds because it's the message of
[34:21] the hour you see the message of the hour
[34:23] when it's preached it doesn't need to be
[34:25] watered down for young people it just
[34:27] needs to be preached
[34:28] you know it's not it's not man trying to
[34:31] show man something it's God it's
[34:33] everything that we can never
[34:35] underestimate is the supernatural
[34:37] because even when you and I to get
[34:40] anything out of this service tonight
[34:41] it'll take the Holy Ghost it'll take the
[34:44] Supernatural and so we're just depending
[34:46] on him tonight and just appreciate
[34:48] brother Ronnie just coming and uh my
[34:51] just we we had a good time you know and
[34:54] brother Ronnie was talking even in the
[34:55] after service and he said he said I felt
[34:58] like I was even getting pulled from the
[35:00] back
[35:01] and uh you know because it we are just
[35:04] feeding on the word of God and uh we
[35:07] just we love the Lord I believe with all
[35:09] my heart we were our young people here
[35:12] and those that were with us we're very
[35:14] benefited amen and so

[35:26] declares behold I go forward but he is
[35:30] not there and backward but I cannot
[35:34] perceive him and on the left hand where
[35:36] he does work but I cannot Behold Him he
[35:40] hideth himself on the right hand that I
[35:43] cannot see him
[35:45] but he knoweth the way that I take
[35:48] and when he hath tried me I shall come
[35:51] forth as gold.
[35:54] my foot hath held his steps and I want
[35:58] you to notice this that job is here and
[36:02] he's making a case
[36:04] and we're just dealing with it in this
[36:06] aspect of the scriptures right now or
[36:09] job is able to say the testimony that's
[36:12] been throughout is I've held his steps
[36:15] so job's not in a place which we know
[36:17] God's grace can reach to you and I like
[36:20] it did to Hezekiah when Hezekiah called
[36:23] out to God and says Lord
[36:24] give Grace that I can set my house in
[36:27] order right but for job here what job is
[36:30] looking at my foot hath held his steps
[36:34] and his way so this has been a testimony
[36:37] throughout and his way have I I kept and
[36:41] I've not declined
[36:43] neither have I gone back from the
[36:46] Commandment of his lips I have esteemed
[36:49] the words of his mouth more than my
[36:53] necessary food I just say it like this
[36:55] in verse 11 and verse 12 can be wrote in
[37:00] my commentary
[37:01] I don't care if there's not one Miracle
[37:04] that's mentioned let that be
[37:08] I believe in miracles our lives are a
[37:11] miracle but if there's never anything
[37:14] that's if it's if it's recorded and you
[37:16] know those that we prayed for and sick
[37:18] and received the Holy Ghost because it's
[37:20] it's not man that's done and anyhow
[37:22] we're just instruments of God but if
[37:25] none of that's wrote If this is if I
[37:27] have my choice of what it is that I I
[37:30] want to be wrote in the commentary this
[37:33] is what I want to be wrote
[37:35] that Samuel was faithful
[37:39] that's that's that's what that's what
[37:40] our desire is because that's what the
[37:42] Rapture is all about it's it's to the
[37:44] faithful amen so we just want to just
[37:48] speak on that a few moments here once
[37:50] again on that word faithful once again
[37:52] God bless you as you're being seated
[37:54] tonight I want to pick up and I want to
[37:57] read this out of three kinds of
[37:58] Believers here
[37:59] again because this this quote is what
[38:02] really is I'm looking at this with
[38:05] faithfulness and when we look at it let
[38:08] me just read it here first brother Brian
[38:10] says sometimes Believers are put to the
[38:12] test and not sometimes but every time
[38:14] for every son that cometh to God must be
[38:17] chastened tried child trained and
[38:20] remember the trials the dusty roads I
[38:24] think it's very fitting I love these
[38:25] descriptions Dusty Rhodes you know how
[38:28] dusty roads are anybody ever tried
[38:30] there's some roads believe it or not in
[38:32] Ohio that are actually Dusty roads there
[38:34] was a place and I think it's near um by
[38:37] the time you'd have to help me out it
[38:38] was it Fredericton where sister Norma
[38:40] lived at one time and the roads that
[38:42] were out there were literally like what
[38:44] we have right out here in the parking
[38:46] lot and when you drove on them you
[38:48] couldn't go very fast and I'm not
[38:49] talking about chip and seal Country
[38:51] Roads I'm talking about the 57 gravel
[38:54] and you're driving on and if somebody
[38:56] starts going very fast
[38:59] you don't see anything it's just a cloud
[39:01] of dust and sometimes we have the dusty
[39:05] roads where you can't see very clearly
[39:07] ahead of you
[39:09] right a lot of the dusty road and it's
[39:12] dry you know it's not mud flinging up
[39:14] it's just dry and it's just dry and all
[39:17] you see is the dust and but that's where
[39:19] trust and that's where faith comes in as
[39:21] a Believer just to trust God and says I
[39:23] know that right beyond all of this Cloud
[39:26] God's still God
[39:28] he's right here he's never left if God
[39:31] has if God has opened this way and led
[39:33] me down this dusty road because the way
[39:36] of the Lord for our life is not that we
[39:38] were all all together always travel on
[39:41] the interstate
[39:43] right nor on toll roads or everything
[39:45] else but there's some roads that we have
[39:47] to travel on that are not very welcoming
[39:50] roads as a matter of fact one of the
[39:52] roads that I was on when we went up to
[39:54] that camp in Australia at that Retreat I
[39:57] was a little concerned with some of the
[39:59] brothers and sisters you know some had
[40:01] come in for uh the meetings uh with at
[40:04] the youth camp and I remembered the
[40:07] track on the way up there and as we were
[40:09] going up there and they take the young
[40:11] people up in buses so the young people
[40:13] don't have to travel back and forth and
[40:16] uh I I remember I told Brother Daniel
[40:18] when the when the saints some of the
[40:20] older ones were leaving and like on
[40:21] after a Sunday evening service I said oh
[40:24] I said may God be with them because that
[40:26] road was not forgiving we're talking
[40:27] there's no guard rails and the roads are
[40:30] not real wide I said oh Lord Jesus help
[40:32] your children I mean I know there no
[40:34] doubt have traveled it many times but
[40:36] sometimes the roads that we're on are
[40:38] not roads that maybe feel very
[40:39] comfortable but if God is leading us
[40:42] then how tell you I you know I wouldn't
[40:45] want to be anywhere else other than
[40:46] where he's at amen we want to be right
[40:49] where he's at so we notice that the
[40:51] trails the dusty roads the hot sun of
[40:54] persecution and this is the the part I
[40:56] want us to draw from but the Loyalty of
[41:00] your heart beats that material till she
[41:03] is ready to go into the mold and God's
[41:06] children is made up correctly on his
[41:08] word for they are living examples and
[41:11] the word of God living through them so
[41:14] the trial comes to shake you to put you
[41:16] to the very bottom to see where you'll
[41:19] stand and I want to just come back to
[41:22] that the Loyalty of your heart beats
[41:24] that material until she's ready to go
[41:27] into the mold
[41:29] through the midst of a test and of a
[41:31] trial and tests and Trials come in many
[41:33] different forms
[41:35] sometimes the way that it can be it can
[41:38] come as a sickness it can come as
[41:40] something you're just laboring and
[41:42] you're praying for and you're praying
[41:43] for a period of time and a period of
[41:45] time and you just seem like there's
[41:46] maybe not getting attraction that you
[41:48] want and and yet in the midst of it here
[41:50] you are that through it discouragement
[41:54] can come Whispers of Doubt can come but
[41:56] the Loyalty in your heart
[42:00] is what stabilizes things the Loyalty in
[42:05] your heart to what to the word is what
[42:07] beats the material it's like when they
[42:11] take that of the uh you know our heart
[42:13] is not God does not liken it to that of
[42:16] brass because brass cannot be uh it's it
[42:19] speaks of judgment it can't be tempered
[42:21] that easily but our heart it would speak
[42:23] of that of even gold something that's
[42:25] very malleable something that's able to
[42:28] be molded and that's how the character
[42:30] is in our life remember the Holy Ghost
[42:34] is the gift of God the character is a
[42:37] victory
[42:39] and so that loyalty even when even when
[42:43] things go against our grain or our
[42:46] feelings but yet we can say Lord Thy
[42:49] word is true above my feelings what's
[42:52] happening
[42:53] it's just a beating on the material just
[42:55] a little bit it's just beating that
[42:57] material what's it doing it's molding
[42:59] that character what is doing that the
[43:01] Loyalty of your heart
[43:03] so it's not the person in whom you might
[43:07] be tested by their responses or things
[43:09] or your boss or co-work or family or or
[43:12] sickness it's the Loyalty of our heart
[43:15] that's actually molding and shaping our
[43:18] character and I I love how the prophet
[43:22] puts it it's not something that's just
[43:23] you know that's just it's just so easily
[43:26] taking place it's beating that material
[43:28] it's beating it it's working on it it's
[43:31] that loyalty of the heart that's beating
[43:33] out patience
[43:34] it's beating out just just trusting it's
[43:37] beating out forgiveness it's beating out
[43:39] all of these things it's there that
[43:42] loyalty that's molding that character
[43:44] throughout and that's where when we
[43:46] stand where job is is having this
[43:48] testimony here right now to be loyal is
[43:52] to be faithful how many know what
[43:54] brother Bram said when he's asked a
[43:56] question how do I win my loved ones to
[43:58] the Lord
[43:59] what did Brother Ram say he said be
[44:02] loyal to what you believe
[44:06] see it's now when we're dealing with
[44:09] loyal faithful it's dealing with
[44:11] expression
[44:13] it's dealing with action and so when we
[44:16] look at this I want to just hear tonight
[44:17] look a little bit further on this of
[44:20] faithful because uh in the scripture
[44:22] because to be faithful it means to
[44:24] remain loyal and steadfast it's also to
[44:28] be reliable it's to be true to the facts
[44:33] of the original I I you know there's
[44:35] nothing about our flesh that's reliable
[44:40] nothing
[44:41] but what is reliable is the word of God
[44:46] and if our life is sown with the word of
[44:48] God and that seed within us it's that
[44:51] which God has come to Quicken and raise
[44:53] up and that's what God is relying on his
[44:56] his own word
[45:00] so if there's something you know I mean
[45:03] you know we can say this on an in the
[45:05] natural in a job some of you are
[45:07] standing supervisors and other things
[45:09] else you know that there's some people
[45:11] you just don't rely on
[45:15] you know I mean if you say well they
[45:17] ought to be like you know better don't
[45:19] don't you're working yourself up find
[45:22] somebody who's reliable
[45:24] and God himself
[45:26] he looks for and he searches and God
[45:29] loves to display that which is reliable
[45:34] is that right
[45:35] because God's desire is for his word to
[45:38] be fulfilled
[45:40] and I'm sure that as we look at this
[45:42] tonight it's not all together the way
[45:44] that we sometimes interpret reliable or
[45:47] faithful or anything because we could
[45:49] put ourselves in a foxhole but it's
[45:51] something to where you can be even
[45:53] counted on it's like that person as I
[45:55] said on the job it isn't that they do
[45:57] everything perfect but you can count on
[45:59] them they're going to be there they're
[46:01] going to do this they're faithful
[46:03] they're loyal
[46:04] and I believe that's what God intends to
[46:08] bring forth out of every one of our
[46:10] Lives as a matter of fact that's what
[46:11] God does within the life of the believer
[46:14] and that becomes a distinguishing
[46:17] quality of a Believer they are called
[46:21] faithful
[46:24] the bible let me just start in with this
[46:26] I refer to this scripture last last week
[46:28] to start off First Corinthians chapter 1
[46:31] verse 9 God is faithful not was not will
[46:35] be but he is
[46:37] faithful
[46:39] in Lamentations 3 18 I said my strength
[46:44] and my hope is perished from the Lord
[46:46] remembering mine Affliction and my
[46:49] misery the wormwood and the gall my soul
[46:52] hath them still in remembrance and this
[46:54] is humbled in me this I recall to mind
[46:59] therefore have I hope it is of the
[47:03] Lord's mercies that we are not consumed
[47:08] because his compassions fail not
[47:13] you understand you and I can't even talk
[47:15] about faithfulness if we're not looking
[47:18] to God who is faithful
[47:20] because man does not make man faithful
[47:24] [Applause]
[47:26] pledges to come to church pledge us to
[47:28] do this it'll never make man faithful
[47:31] but God who is faithful makes faithful
[47:35] subjects
[47:36] it has an effect
[47:40] it is of the Lord's mercies that we are
[47:43] not consumed because his compassions
[47:45] fail not they are new every morning
[47:51] great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my
[47:56] portion saith my soul therefore will I
[47:58] hope in him the Lord is good unto them
[48:01] that wait for him to the soul that
[48:05] seeketh him it is good that a man should
[48:08] both hope and quietly wait for the
[48:12] Salvation of the Lord
[48:13] and the message questions and answers
[48:15] brother Brown said I don't know he's
[48:17] talking about answering questions I
[48:18] don't know whether they got on
[48:19] backsliding but I thought I wish
[48:20] somebody would ask me that about on
[48:23] backsliding remember you backslide every
[48:25] day no way at all for you to keep out of
[48:28] it but you backslide to the people at
[48:31] church but not before God
[48:35] notice before the people at church but
[48:38] not before God now let me work this here
[48:41] now a little bit you see you backslide
[48:44] on Christ but you don't on God cause if
[48:48] you would when you sin you're gone but
[48:51] you're constantly falling Paul had to
[48:54] die every day he had to die every day to
[48:57] repent every day and just constantly
[48:59] repenting all the time and if Paul had
[49:01] to do that then I'm going to have to too
[49:04] aren't you
[49:06] are you with me now so you see in Christ
[49:09] the same thing with Abraham and Sarah
[49:11] when Sarah laughed God would have slew
[49:14] her but she was identified in her Union
[49:17] with Abraham and that's why brother
[49:19] Branham all the way through the message
[49:21] will take this and say if it wasn't that
[49:24] we were hidden in Christ he said God
[49:27] would take us out but notice we are
[49:30] identified by his life in the blood and
[49:34] it is his life that's expressing through
[49:36] you and I you know it's his life inside
[49:39] of you and me that brings conviction in
[49:42] our life that leads us to a place to say
[49:45] forgive me and it may not have even been
[49:47] anything you said or done but it's a
[49:50] thought that came through your life or
[49:52] it's something that may be an attitude
[49:54] that you've sensed and you say Lord
[49:56] forgive me why because you realize I am
[49:59] in his presence all the time
[50:03] and God is faithful he doesn't leave me
[50:06] and then come back but his presence is
[50:08] right around me the whole time and
[50:10] because of that awareness great is his
[50:13] faithfulness I want to stay in favor
[50:16] with God I want his presence if I can
[50:19] put it like this I want God to be so at
[50:22] home in my life he can put his head in
[50:24] my lap he can lean back on the recliner
[50:27] he can take his shoes off he can find
[50:30] rest refreshment and Joy by
[50:33] fellowshipping in my life
[50:37] good appreciate Oh Glory and I know this
[50:40] brother goes on in part two of that
[50:43] question and answer he said now we were
[50:44] talking on the word backsliding this
[50:46] morning and when you do that you're
[50:48] Bachelorette yes sir you got to repent
[50:50] now I don't mean to say you went out in
[50:52] the world you did this and that but you
[50:54] done something and you've got to repent
[50:56] and Die daily to live in Jesus Christ
[51:00] but Samuel I feel so bad thank God you
[51:02] feel so bad
[51:04] if you didn't feel bad about it
[51:06] something's wrong with you
[51:10] so every daily every day you've got to
[51:15] die every day to live in Christ Jesus
[51:20] Psalms 119 89. forever O Lord Thy word
[51:25] is settled in heaven
[51:27] thy faithfulness is unto all generations
[51:32] thou Hast establish the Earth and it
[51:35] abideth they continue this day according
[51:38] to thine ordinances for all are thy
[51:41] servants remember his first Bible he
[51:45] wrote it in the heavens
[51:47] remember when job is referred to uh God
[51:51] refers him God takes him to the heavens
[51:54] is that right you'll even find it I
[51:57] believe it's in Amos and you'll find
[51:59] that many of the Minor Prophets they
[52:00] will refer to that of seek Him who
[52:04] holdeth the Seven Stars in his sand in
[52:06] the belt of Orion right it will speak to
[52:09] that of the of the consolation it will
[52:11] speak to there as David said he hath
[52:13] declared his handiwork his Heaven the
[52:15] heavens declare his handiwork so God
[52:18] wrote his first Bible in the heavens and
[52:21] to know that even in the ordinances
[52:23] themselves the moon and the stars all of
[52:26] the things the uh the Moon is set for
[52:29] the ordinances the keeping of time you
[52:31] see it on your calendar when it's going
[52:32] to be a new moon when it's going to be
[52:34] you know partial Moon and when it's
[52:36] going to be a full moon all of that
[52:38] those are ordinances that have been set
[52:41] by God and though time has changed a lot
[52:44] of man has lived on the Earth but not
[52:46] one of those ordinances has ever been
[52:49] changed God's never went back one time
[52:52] and said you know what I think we need
[52:54] to put the moon over here or I think we
[52:56] need to do it over there let me tell you
[52:58] something whatever is touched by man
[53:00] will fail but when it's in God's hands
[53:03] it'll remain and it'll take off on time
[53:06] just exactly and he will continue to
[53:09] declare the handiwork of God
[53:11] so I'd say God help me to get my hands
[53:13] off of everything
[53:15] let me let me put it into your hands and
[53:18] most importantly my life in your hands
[53:20] Lord every situation every need in your
[53:23] hands Lord God because they are upheld
[53:26] remember they are upheld by the word of
[53:29] his power in Psalms 36 5 thy mercy O
[53:33] Lord is in the heavens and thy
[53:36] faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds oh
[53:40] it goes far beyond that of man all the
[53:43] failures in every other realm but God's
[53:46] faithfulness endureth Mercy in the
[53:48] heavens aren't you glad that God has
[53:50] Mercy reserved for you and I
[53:54] now remember what Mercy is reserved for
[53:56] is Mercy remember those that will repent
[53:59] Mercy is given
[54:02] so don't ever be ashamed to repent
[54:06] hey man it's something that you know let
[54:08] me just say it like this listen
[54:09] repentance is not living in a defeated
[54:12] State that's living in a kind of place
[54:14] to wherein your walk with God to where
[54:17] constantly daily Moment by moment your
[54:20] desire is am I pleasing to my Lord or my
[54:23] thoughts or the thoughts in my mind are
[54:26] they pleasing to the Lord are my actions
[54:28] pleasing to the Lord are the things that
[54:31] I'm looking at is it pleasing unto the
[54:33] Lord because remember he is an
[54:36] All-Seeing Eye that is watching you and
[54:38] I and I want fellowship with him he
[54:41] wants fellowship with you
[54:44] amen God is coming back for a people who
[54:48] cares because he careth for you he made
[54:51] a way that you and I might even be able
[54:53] to care if he hadn't made a way through
[54:56] him by the blood we would never be
[54:58] able to rightfully care but he made a
[55:01] way that you and I could care the right
[55:03] way
[55:04] oh thank God Isaiah 25 1 oh Lord Thou
[55:10] Art my God I will exalt thee I will
[55:13] praise thy name for thou Hast done
[55:15] wonderful things thy councils of old are
[55:20] faithfulness and Truth
[55:23] you see God's reputation
[55:27] sometimes it's been a long time coming
[55:30] for a promise to be fulfilled
[55:33] but God ain't never forgot about it
[55:36] like Peter would pick up under
[55:37] inspiration God is Not slack concerning
[55:40] any of his promises
[55:42] don't look around and say man this
[55:44] generation this is too bad no we're
[55:47] fullness is to all generations that's
[55:50] why every generation as the prophet said
[55:52] must have their fresh chance at the word
[55:55] of God in other words the same baptism
[55:58] of the Holy Ghost is available to every
[56:02] generation he's the Living God he never
[56:05] ceased he never diminished as a matter
[56:07] of fact if you really want to know it
[56:08] the right way that the word has not
[56:10] diminished the word has only grown in
[56:13] intensity and power and glory amen that
[56:17] word was demonstrated and manifested
[56:19] through the vessel of God's prophet in
[56:22] this hour but think about it in a many
[56:24] member body where people and lives are
[56:27] willing to forget about their ideas
[56:29] forget about themselves and the glory
[56:32] and the power of God can be made
[56:34] manifest through a body of Believers I
[56:37] say the faithfulness of God is so great
[56:42] he's faithful
[56:47] God ain't never got himself into
[56:49] something where he said I'm In Too Deep
[56:54] he's faithful
[56:56] a promise might linger but though it
[57:00] Tarry God will fulfill it
[57:03] every promise everything that God has
[57:07] said I wonder how I've wondered many
[57:10] times over the years how that many of
[57:12] them when brother Branham would stand
[57:13] there and make the statements that he
[57:16] would make regarding this generation
[57:19] and you know I'm not you know I didn't
[57:21] live in the 50s but I'm not you know Coy
[57:24] to understand that I know there were
[57:26] some rotten things even back then I mean
[57:27] when my family went down to um
[57:30] Gatlinburg there many many years ago
[57:32] about uh you know and went through that
[57:34] Titanic Museum I remember them pointing
[57:36] out names and things like that of of a
[57:38] man you know different ones who lawyers
[57:40] doctors whatever they had their wife on
[57:42] this deck and their mistress on the
[57:44] underdeck so there was rottenness always
[57:46] around
[57:47] brother Ram told us with homosexuality
[57:50] he told us back then it was filled in
[57:52] the government
[57:53] he also told us regarding think about
[57:56] when he would stand there and he's
[57:58] announcing this world is falling apart
[58:00] and to think about look look listen when
[58:02] you think back to those times and in
[58:04] that moment right there I wonder what
[58:06] they thought but what it is he's looking
[58:08] at there is a seed that's being sown you
[58:12] can't sow the wrong seed and expect a
[58:14] different crop
[58:16] but if you sow the seed of the word God
[58:19] is faithful to his word it might take a
[58:23] while for the crop to come to fruition
[58:25] But be sure you're sowing God's word
[58:28] because if you show God's word then God
[58:30] will water it God will bring the
[58:32] increase and God will see it through
[58:38] now I want to read this here in the Book
[58:40] of Psalms chapter 12 verse 1.
[58:43] I want you to look at this here for a
[58:45] moment
[58:46] the Bible said here is David writing
[58:50] help Lord
[58:51] for The Godly Man
[58:53] ceaseth
[58:55] for the faithful
[58:57] fail from Among The Children of Men
[59:00] they speak vanity in other words it's
[59:03] emptiness everyone with his neighbor
[59:05] with flattering lips and with a double
[59:07] heart do they speak
[59:09] the Lord shall cut off on flattering
[59:12] lips in the tongue that speaketh proud
[59:14] things who have said with our tongue
[59:16] will we Prevail our lips are on who is
[59:20] Lord over us for the oppression of the
[59:22] poor for the sang of the needy now will
[59:25] I will arise saith the Lord I will set
[59:28] him in safety from him that puffeth at
[59:31] him
[59:32] I want you to watch here you know this
[59:34] is why when brother Brandon said he
[59:36] would say it throughout in the seals and
[59:38] he says he said if you're thinking one
[59:41] thing and saying another he said you
[59:43] better stop that
[59:45] he said because we're getting we're
[59:47] coming to a time it's a little different
[59:49] now he's not talking about thoughts
[59:51] passing through but he's talking about
[59:53] speak the truth from your heart
[59:56] right and I'm not talking about walking
[59:58] around and saying well I'm a miserable
[1:00:00] Christian that ain't God's language
[1:00:03] I tell you what the prophet called it he
[1:00:05] called that the devil's language
[1:00:08] I don't have very much Faith he said
[1:00:09] that's what the devil wants you to say
[1:00:12] I don't want to talk his language God
[1:00:14] changed my language I don't want nothing
[1:00:17] to do with the devil's language
[1:00:20] so what is the devil's language negative
[1:00:23] with a capital N
[1:00:28] say God help me to be a positive Pete
[1:00:30] not a Negative Nancy
[1:00:33] forgive me if your name's Nancy
[1:00:35] but you know how it is you you walk with
[1:00:37] people that sometimes all they can see
[1:00:39] is the glass oh it's half empty oh it's
[1:00:42] half to empty half empty
[1:00:44] oh it's from it's just
[1:00:47] well brother Samuel it's half empty no
[1:00:49] it's half full
[1:00:52] it's half full
[1:00:54] listen friends because we're in this
[1:00:56] negative house there is a tendency
[1:01:00] there is a there can be a tendency I
[1:01:02] know we all can be made up differently
[1:01:04] but may God help you and I to listen I
[1:01:07] wonder if we would record our
[1:01:09] conversation sometimes I wonder the
[1:01:12] percentage
[1:01:13] how much of the time are we positive or
[1:01:16] negative well brother Samuel I'm just
[1:01:18] trying to be humble well let me update
[1:01:20] you on what humility is that is not
[1:01:23] humility
[1:01:25] that is you looking at a situation
[1:01:28] whether you're criticizing whether
[1:01:30] you're taking something down or you're
[1:01:31] looking at it in a way of human
[1:01:32] instrumentality let me just say this all
[1:01:35] the way through this building right here
[1:01:36] when we speak of the word faithful not
[1:01:39] one of us can Pat ourselves on the back
[1:01:42] as though that we have made ourselves
[1:01:44] faithful we are faithful because of his
[1:01:48] faithfulness
[1:01:50] convert
[1:01:51] is that right there is nobody here that
[1:01:54] can take Glory of that it is God it is
[1:01:57] God's mercies the Lord's compassions
[1:02:00] that we are not consumed
[1:02:04] well by the Samuel what good does that
[1:02:05] do well it does a lot of good because
[1:02:07] you see when we get to looking on
[1:02:09] ourselves or our goodness God knows just
[1:02:11] how to bring about a real humility in
[1:02:14] our lives so we get our eyes off of
[1:02:16] ourselves as though that we had
[1:02:17] something to do with it we have nothing
[1:02:20] to do with it it's our yielding to his
[1:02:23] voice it's believing what he said
[1:02:26] despite our own thoughts or thoughts
[1:02:29] that we ourselves can have it is
[1:02:32] believing what God has said that's where
[1:02:35] overcoming lies
[1:02:39] now notice this right here the words I
[1:02:41] want you to watch how David goes here
[1:02:42] the words of the Lord are pure words as
[1:02:46] silver tried in a furnace of Earth
[1:02:49] purified seven times I know he brought
[1:02:51] this back to my mind where I was talking
[1:02:53] to you about humility how many knows
[1:02:55] remember the Jerry preached on
[1:02:56] complaining
[1:02:57] remember that
[1:02:59] boy that was too long
[1:03:03] he ain't listening in tonight
[1:03:08] man no I'm just teasing
[1:03:12] teasing but you know what I thought when
[1:03:13] he was preaching I shared with him after
[1:03:14] service
[1:03:15] I thought of that out of the message
[1:03:17] uniting time and sign
[1:03:19] and brother Brandon says you know he
[1:03:21] said God help me
[1:03:22] he said sometimes you've seen when
[1:03:24] people get older he said they get they
[1:03:26] get an old crabby cantankerous Spirit
[1:03:28] around them all they want to do and
[1:03:30] sometimes it ain't just even older it's
[1:03:32] just younger I mean and sometimes you
[1:03:33] listen to me how can that be some of the
[1:03:36] aches the pains the sickness and the
[1:03:37] trials and the tests and everything of
[1:03:40] life
[1:03:41] right not make an excuse but I look out
[1:03:43] brother Brown was saying it he's seen
[1:03:44] this he said God Don't Let Me Be Lonely
[1:03:46] let my life be crowned that way let my
[1:03:49] life be crowned with the fruit of the
[1:03:51] spirit
[1:03:52] and then he makes something a statement
[1:03:54] very simple
[1:03:55] he said Do You Realize complaining
[1:03:58] weakens faith
[1:04:02] complaining weakens faith
[1:04:06] do you realize even in things that
[1:04:08] you're praying about I'm praying about
[1:04:09] we're looking to God in our lives and
[1:04:11] other things like that but you realize
[1:04:13] it might be something to come right
[1:04:14] across our pathway has seemingly nothing
[1:04:16] to do with that but complaining itself
[1:04:19] can weaken the very faith
[1:04:22] that's needed to move through that
[1:04:24] promise
[1:04:26] I say Lord help us
[1:04:28] help me
[1:04:29] help me Lord now notice let me read this
[1:04:31] in verse six the words of the Lord are
[1:04:33] pure words as silver tried in a furnace
[1:04:36] of Earth purified seven times Thou shalt
[1:04:39] keep them O Lord Thou shalt preserve
[1:04:42] them from this
[1:04:44] generation Forever The Wicked walk on
[1:04:47] every side when the vilest men are
[1:04:50] exalted so David is letting it be known
[1:04:53] the faithful the faithful fail from out
[1:04:56] of the Earth where is The Godly man but
[1:04:58] God is faithful is he not
[1:05:00] now how does God prove his word god
[1:05:03] proves his word through believers
[1:05:06] right God has said there wouldn't be
[1:05:09] there would be Believers that would go
[1:05:11] into the promised land but there were
[1:05:13] those who rose up bought a bad report
[1:05:16] those that joined with it and said we
[1:05:18] can't do it our kids are going to you
[1:05:20] know they don't they it's too tough It's
[1:05:22] too tight it's too you know and all
[1:05:24] these excuses they had that aren't that
[1:05:26] land will consume our kids but you know
[1:05:28] what God couldn't prove his word through
[1:05:31] him why they weren't believers
[1:05:33] but the two who were Joshua and Caleb
[1:05:37] God proved his word through them as a
[1:05:39] matter of fact brother Branham tells us
[1:05:41] like this and proving his word God
[1:05:43] himself crossed over into the promised
[1:05:47] land through the Believers of that day
[1:05:52] oh my available
[1:05:56] truth God
[1:06:00] been in London I've been desire within
[1:06:02] our heart is Lord let me just stand true
[1:06:04] to you who are faithful and God who is
[1:06:07] faithful will prove his faithfulness
[1:06:11] through surrendered lives
[1:06:13] but for these right here David has wrote
[1:06:16] right here God will not compromise God
[1:06:18] don't have to trim the gospel God don't
[1:06:20] have to manufacture it you see many
[1:06:22] times the things that's done is to try
[1:06:24] to make the gospel palable let me just
[1:06:26] bring it on down maybe to try to make
[1:06:28] the message palatable I'm not interested
[1:06:30] in making this message look good or
[1:06:33] making it palatable what I'm interested
[1:06:35] is preaching it in power and the
[1:06:37] authority it was delivered in because
[1:06:39] this message was not sent for goats this
[1:06:43] message was sent to call the Sheep of
[1:06:46] God into the Liberty they're longing
[1:06:49] forth you'll never make a goat a sheep
[1:06:51] but a sheep will be led forth from the
[1:06:54] bondage that they're in into a glorious
[1:06:56] Liberty this gospel doesn't need to be
[1:06:59] watered down
[1:07:01] that's what the world has done what's
[1:07:03] did that the reasoning of man
[1:07:08] that's why everything is so filled it's
[1:07:10] become as the scripture said every table
[1:07:13] is become filthy and full of vomit
[1:07:20] God
[1:07:21] if people don't want to be heed to God's
[1:07:24] word God will keep his word from them
[1:07:27] that's what this is just saying right
[1:07:29] here if people do not want to heed to
[1:07:31] the word of God and allow the word to
[1:07:33] examine their lives then God will keep
[1:07:36] his word he will not reveal himself to
[1:07:39] them but for lives that desire to be
[1:07:42] faithful to God through thick sin up
[1:07:45] down through every situation even to be
[1:07:48] able to stand there time and time again
[1:07:50] daily and say Lord forgive me Lord help
[1:07:53] me Lord God give me strength Lord once
[1:07:55] again faithfulness to the word I we
[1:07:58] don't want to stand there and make
[1:07:59] excuses when we're confronted with the
[1:08:02] word well my daddy was like this my mama
[1:08:04] was like that that's called Disobedience
[1:08:07] but we want to stand on the word to a
[1:08:09] faithful God to know there's no spirit
[1:08:11] that has been down through time it might
[1:08:14] have traveled down through that family
[1:08:16] tree for a long time but there is no
[1:08:19] spirit that has been unconquered but as
[1:08:21] a matter of fact he is the mighty
[1:08:23] conqueror he tore hell to Pieces he
[1:08:26] conquered every great demon
[1:08:29] and he rose again and he gave that same
[1:08:32] authority of the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:35] Ghost back to the believer and says you
[1:08:38] shall possess the Gate of every enemy no
[1:08:41] matter what comes up against you you've
[1:08:43] got the power in you to possess that
[1:08:46] gate you've got the authority to possess
[1:08:49] the Gate of every devil that rises its
[1:08:52] head
[1:08:55] and I'm just simple enough to believe it
[1:09:00] just simple enough to believe it
[1:09:03] oh my
[1:09:04] it portrays God's faithfulness through
[1:09:07] lives that just surrender to him now
[1:09:09] notice this in first Samuel 2 35. see
[1:09:12] God's interested in faithfulness now
[1:09:14] remember when the priesthood itself was
[1:09:16] instituted and you had the high priest
[1:09:18] and then all of those in the levitical
[1:09:19] priesthood that would be there now
[1:09:22] remember here you find that these are
[1:09:24] the sons of Eli and what Eli's Sons had
[1:09:27] done you know there were things that
[1:09:29] they were not doing what was right they
[1:09:31] were doing some very subtle deceitful
[1:09:33] things and so forth that Eli himself was
[1:09:36] not it was not unknown to him there were
[1:09:38] things that he knew about but Eli was
[1:09:41] not correcting or pending to that so
[1:09:43] then notice how within this with that
[1:09:46] fallibility of manner the breakdown
[1:09:48] you'll notice how that the spirit of God
[1:09:50] will pick up and prophecy will come
[1:09:52] forth such as in verse 35 where he is
[1:09:55] speaking about the coming of the Lord
[1:09:58] Jesus our Melchizedek I Will Raise Me Up
[1:10:00] notice who's talking God is speaking I
[1:10:04] will face me up a faithful priest that
[1:10:07] shall do according to that which is in
[1:10:09] the mine heart and in my mind and I will
[1:10:11] build him a sure house and he shall walk
[1:10:13] before mine anointed forever I remember
[1:10:16] brother Bill shared something with me
[1:10:18] years ago I don't remember the name the
[1:10:19] exact number now but brother Jerry
[1:10:21] referred to it when the high priest
[1:10:23] would go in once a year and he would
[1:10:24] have to go in with the blood you know it
[1:10:26] would represent not only for his own but
[1:10:28] then also to atone for that of the
[1:10:30] congregation once a year and while all
[1:10:33] that was speaking of is that once and
[1:10:34] for all it would be done through Calvary
[1:10:36] right but remember if that priest if
[1:10:39] there was something that was out of line
[1:10:41] remember the pomegranates and the bell
[1:10:43] sure it's a sound of Joy but if those on
[1:10:46] the outside did not hear that that's why
[1:10:48] they tied that rope to his leg they knew
[1:10:51] that guy's dead because he's come into
[1:10:53] the presence of God and there's things
[1:10:55] that's not right and what happened he
[1:10:58] fell dead and I can't remember the exact
[1:11:00] number brother bill sent it to me the
[1:11:01] one time it was an astronomical number
[1:11:04] of priests ones after another when you
[1:11:07] take the span of the years that had died
[1:11:09] that had lived Unfaithful and had died
[1:11:13] even through the ceremonial place let me
[1:11:15] just say it like this as much as man
[1:11:17] could even try there were some that we
[1:11:20] can look at in the Old Testament and say
[1:11:22] they were faithful individuals but God
[1:11:24] here is speaking of something much
[1:11:26] deeper of to where that the coming of
[1:11:28] the Holy Ghost would bring about a
[1:11:31] faithful priesthood a faithful ones
[1:11:33] those that would be Kings and Priests
[1:11:36] unto our God and he says I Will Raise Me
[1:11:39] Up a faithful priest let me tell you
[1:11:40] something anything that God raises up it
[1:11:43] will have this quality in it
[1:11:46] anything that God brings forth it'll be
[1:11:48] faithful so how can you say that once
[1:11:50] again look at the Moon
[1:11:52] look at the stars
[1:11:54] is that right right now notice with this
[1:11:57] faithful priest Hebrews 2 17 wherefore
[1:12:00] in all things that behooved him to be
[1:12:02] made like unto his Brethren that he
[1:12:04] might be a merciful and faithful high
[1:12:08] priest in things pertaining to God to
[1:12:12] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:12:15] people so not only did he come down God
[1:12:18] came down that he might understand this
[1:12:20] he might experience all of that the
[1:12:22] Temptation the pressures and all of
[1:12:24] those things that would come about we
[1:12:26] knew even how brother Brown would tell
[1:12:27] us that he even experienced headache he
[1:12:29] experienced a lot of those a lot of
[1:12:30] those different things God was able he's
[1:12:33] experienced it so God is able to be able
[1:12:36] to relate to you and I not by knowledge
[1:12:38] but because he has undergone the same
[1:12:41] experience he is a merciful and faithful
[1:12:45] high priest in things pertaining to God
[1:12:47] so the whole objective is to bring a
[1:12:50] Reconciliation between God and man
[1:12:52] that's what the faithfulness of God does
[1:12:55] the faith faithfulness you see the
[1:12:57] faithfulness of God working to bring
[1:12:59] about that reconciliation between God
[1:13:01] and man it affects every other
[1:13:04] relationship it affects everything about
[1:13:06] around in our life and God's main focus
[1:13:09] within this was to bring a
[1:13:12] Reconciliation and a Harmony
[1:13:15] well if that's the way this that's the
[1:13:17] way his faithfulness did I think that
[1:13:20] ought to be the same way within our
[1:13:21] lives we ought to be faithful
[1:13:24] to live in harmony
[1:13:27] the Bible goes over and over that that
[1:13:30] the Bible would say follow holiness
[1:13:33] with all men right following peace
[1:13:35] without such no man shall see God
[1:13:38] it would also go on to say live
[1:13:41] peaceably with all men
[1:13:43] as much as possible
[1:13:46] that doesn't mean that we're drawing
[1:13:48] limits what it means is is that there
[1:13:50] are limitations because just as much as
[1:13:52] you can live it's more important you
[1:13:54] live Peaceable here
[1:13:56] are you hearing me it's you and I live
[1:13:58] in Peaceable here well you don't know
[1:14:00] what so-and-so is doing to me no no it's
[1:14:02] not about so-and-so
[1:14:04] does the Loyalty of your heart beat out
[1:14:07] peace
[1:14:09] it's all about because then we're
[1:14:11] getting into passing the buck and when I
[1:14:13] can't do this and I can't no no remember
[1:14:15] who has made you Faithful a faithful God
[1:14:18] and if a faithful God has bring about
[1:14:21] he's done a faithful work in your life
[1:14:23] he's filled you with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:24] that's a faithful work that's God seeing
[1:14:27] a word through it might have been years
[1:14:29] it might have been months amen may not
[1:14:30] have been all of a sudden and no matter
[1:14:32] what it was God never gave up on you he
[1:14:35] never gave up on me why because we are a
[1:14:37] part of that word and God is faithful
[1:14:41] you'll never find one place there'll
[1:14:44] never be one person that'll stand there
[1:14:46] that day at the white Throne judgment
[1:14:48] and be able to accuse God of throwing in
[1:14:51] the towel
[1:14:53] not one of them
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:14:56] but it will be they threw in the town
[1:14:59] they got tired oh but let me tell you
[1:15:02] this right now regardless God's word is
[1:15:05] faithful and God is faithful
[1:15:08] I may not see everything yet in my life
[1:15:11] but God is faithful
[1:15:14] and if there's something that's to be
[1:15:16] moved out of the way God is faithful to
[1:15:19] show me what is to be moved out of the
[1:15:21] way
[1:15:21] [Applause]
[1:15:25] oh my mama
[1:15:28] notice in Psalms 40 verse 10 let me just
[1:15:31] skip to that here he is here this is the
[1:15:34] speaking this is one of the Messianic
[1:15:36] Psalms it's speaking of the very life of
[1:15:39] Jesus Christ the God's Own Life coming
[1:15:41] down to you and I I have not hid
[1:15:44] thy righteousness
[1:15:47] within my heart
[1:15:49] I have
[1:15:51] declared thy faithfulness
[1:15:54] and thy salvation
[1:15:56] I have not concealed thy loving kindness
[1:15:59] and thy truth
[1:16:01] from the great congregation
[1:16:04] so God raising up
[1:16:06] a faithful high priest God becoming
[1:16:10] one of us
[1:16:12] blue brown would say it just simply like
[1:16:14] this he says God took upon him our form
[1:16:19] that he might mold in US
[1:16:22] his character
[1:16:24] there was no other way to bring it
[1:16:26] there was no other way to bring this
[1:16:29] unite uniting this Unity
[1:16:32] I mean that in itself you know you
[1:16:34] continue to come back to that I mean it
[1:16:37] strikes your heart to recognize it
[1:16:39] wasn't us it's not us seeking after God
[1:16:42] it's God seeking
[1:16:44] it's God coming down for you and I to
[1:16:48] make a way and the faithfulness of God
[1:16:50] was not concealed
[1:16:53] but it was manifested the word that was
[1:16:57] promised it was manifested did they
[1:17:00] catch it no not right then when it was
[1:17:02] happening think about God's faithfulness
[1:17:05] even in the Fulfillment of those who
[1:17:07] were sick in their body the Bible tells
[1:17:10] us in the Book of Matthew that he came
[1:17:12] and he healed many that were bound with
[1:17:14] spirits and diverse diseases that it
[1:17:17] might be fulfilled has it said that he
[1:17:21] bore their infirmities
[1:17:25] even as he's walking here upon Earth
[1:17:28] it's a declaration of the faithfulness
[1:17:30] of God don't you understand that's why
[1:17:33] that when they were walking on the road
[1:17:35] to Emmaus I'm the mess Emmaus they were
[1:17:39] walking they were sad they were
[1:17:40] disheartened and he steps out now he
[1:17:43] could have uncovered their eyes right
[1:17:46] then
[1:17:48] but he chose to do it the same way he
[1:17:50] does it for you and I he opens our eyes
[1:17:54] and reveals himself through his word
[1:17:57] because what does that do it shows you
[1:18:00] an eye that even in the midst of our
[1:18:02] down or our grief like it was for those
[1:18:04] disciples they couldn't understand it
[1:18:06] but when he was able to take them and
[1:18:09] beginning with the prophets and through
[1:18:11] the Psalms he was able to show them
[1:18:14] God's faithfulness
[1:18:17] the coming of this Messiah is a
[1:18:20] faithfulness and a fulfillment of every
[1:18:22] promise
[1:18:24] and that's why God in this generation he
[1:18:27] took every promise and he shook it
[1:18:29] before the Church of the Living God and
[1:18:31] there was not one promise that God
[1:18:34] himself did not raise up and manifest
[1:18:36] that he still the same yesterday today
[1:18:39] and forever why that you and I might
[1:18:41] have a complete confidence in the
[1:18:44] faithfulness of almighty God that no
[1:18:46] matter how dark it is but the light
[1:18:49] pierces through the darkness
[1:18:52] God is faithful
[1:18:57] Hallelujah
[1:18:58] glory be to God
[1:19:01] 's the one who makes us faithful in
[1:19:03] Hosea chapter 2. now this is here in the
[1:19:06] midst of this in Hosea 2. he goes in the
[1:19:09] verses before this
[1:19:11] he's speaking of the Millennium coming
[1:19:13] on
[1:19:14] you'll find that many in the Minor
[1:19:16] Prophets
[1:19:17] but then
[1:19:19] you know it would seem like well
[1:19:20] everything should go in a chronological
[1:19:21] order many times in scriptures but it
[1:19:23] don't you find with prophets they'll
[1:19:24] break back and forth in inspiration
[1:19:27] is that right even you find Zechariah 12
[1:19:31] 8 in the evening time it shall be light
[1:19:33] it's it's smacked right in the middle
[1:19:34] not it's not a chronological listing
[1:19:37] but you get those it just goes to show
[1:19:39] us that you know what when it looks like
[1:19:42] everything's all over God's right in the
[1:19:45] middle of it
[1:19:49] I preached the message one time God's
[1:19:51] never let me preach it here but I I
[1:19:53] preached it out and God dropped it one
[1:19:54] time and I was out ministering it and I
[1:19:56] just I preached on just that Junction
[1:19:58] between that that colon and the next
[1:20:01] word in Isaiah 61 and how that God
[1:20:03] working through among the Gentiles and
[1:20:05] I'll tell you we just you know you
[1:20:06] preach up those Inspirations like that
[1:20:08] it's the grace of God that steps right
[1:20:10] in the middle of the situation so just
[1:20:12] because you think you know the next
[1:20:14] event let me just tell you God is right
[1:20:17] there
[1:20:19] oh my it ain't the end of the story
[1:20:24] amen Hosea chapter 2 verse 9 so here the
[1:20:28] prophet under inspiration breaks forth
[1:20:30] in the return of the 144 000 the Jews to
[1:20:35] come back into the Fulfillment of the
[1:20:36] word and they received their promise now
[1:20:38] notice verse 19 God's speaking
[1:20:41] prophetically unto that I will betroth
[1:20:43] thee unto me forever yea I will betrothy
[1:20:47] unto me in righteousness and in judgment
[1:20:49] and in loving kindness and in mercies I
[1:20:53] will even betrothy unto me in
[1:20:57] faithfulness and thou shalt know the
[1:21:00] Lord
[1:21:01] his faithfulness to keep his word who is
[1:21:05] it that enters the sanctuary in the
[1:21:06] marriage first
[1:21:08] you know you and when they're going to
[1:21:09] have a marriage ceremony
[1:21:11] the man right
[1:21:14] I know today we got it to where the the
[1:21:16] woman's asking the man will you marry me
[1:21:21] they got all mixed up but who enters
[1:21:24] first the man
[1:21:26] what's the man showing
[1:21:28] I'm the initiator of this Covenant
[1:21:31] I'm the one that has sought this out
[1:21:34] right sure there's been a reciprocated
[1:21:37] who's going to walk down the aisle has
[1:21:38] reciprocated what has been sought out
[1:21:40] and is Desiring to come into that
[1:21:42] Covenant and let me just say this to you
[1:21:44] right now the almighty God as the
[1:21:46] prophet said that he will be made known
[1:21:48] to Israel his power and His glory will
[1:21:52] be made known among them the preaching
[1:21:54] of those two witnesses will be the same
[1:21:57] Ministry that you and I are under right
[1:21:59] now that's pointing to Jesus Christ is
[1:22:02] the true atonement it'll be the
[1:22:05] outpouring of the same baptism of the
[1:22:07] Holy Ghost
[1:22:10] amen and they will have come as the
[1:22:12] prophet said to know his power to know
[1:22:14] his glory to know his character and when
[1:22:17] they shall see him
[1:22:19] and he reveals himself to them
[1:22:23] then there'll be a weeping
[1:22:27] but you see I'll betrothy to me and
[1:22:29] faithful how could you and I be faithful
[1:22:32] without him
[1:22:35] how
[1:22:37] it's got to be him
[1:22:39] and then all on him
[1:22:42] without
[1:22:43] him that can do nothing
[1:22:45] let me tell you there ain't not one of
[1:22:48] us that has the track record like God
[1:22:51] but if we could have that we wouldn't
[1:22:53] need God but that's why we need him he
[1:22:57] is my everything
[1:22:58] great is that faithfulness oh God not
[1:23:02] only that you could save a Wretch like
[1:23:04] me but you keep working with my life you
[1:23:07] keep molding me keep shaking me
[1:23:10] Great Is Thy Faithfulness oh God
[1:23:15] like that stone brother Ronnie when he
[1:23:17] was preaching and he showed that big old
[1:23:19] chunk of marble
[1:23:21] you asked Michelangelo some of the
[1:23:24] statements Michelangelo said regarding
[1:23:26] that chunk of stone he said inside of
[1:23:29] there was Michelangelo and he said it
[1:23:31] was I was commissioned to set him free
[1:23:35] he was in there but I was commissioned
[1:23:38] to set him free let me tell you
[1:23:40] something God knew what was down on the
[1:23:42] inside of this muck
[1:23:43] [Applause]
[1:23:45] that was looked over but what's inside
[1:23:48] the stone it takes one with a vision in
[1:23:52] his mind to know what he's put in there
[1:23:54] and what he put in there will not be
[1:23:56] different than what he thought and what
[1:23:58] he thought will not be different than
[1:23:59] what he spoke he will all line up to be
[1:24:02] the wired itself manifested in
[1:24:04] faithfulness
[1:24:10] I read this to you last week too let me
[1:24:12] just try to bring this down it's numbers
[1:24:14] 12 7 my servant Moses is not so remember
[1:24:17] Moses will be in question
[1:24:19] by Miriam and Aaron
[1:24:24] who is faithful
[1:24:26] in all mine house now this is what Moses
[1:24:28] taken up for himself
[1:24:30] this is God taken up for Moses
[1:24:33] I mean it's one thing for you and me to
[1:24:36] say hey I'm faithful it's another thing
[1:24:38] for God to say he's faithful in all my
[1:24:41] house
[1:24:42] do you realize that though Moses himself
[1:24:45] was an instrument used by God
[1:24:48] to bring forth the expression of the
[1:24:50] heavenly
[1:24:52] and that expression of the Heavenly of
[1:24:53] that Tabernacle
[1:24:55] it was speaking of God's desire
[1:24:59] to get back to his rightful position
[1:25:02] in the heart of man
[1:25:04] and God took it through little types
[1:25:06] through the scripture slowly unfolding
[1:25:11] this mystery
[1:25:13] God is faithful just little
[1:25:16] here little
[1:25:17] they're little here a little
[1:25:20] they're a little
[1:25:22] what's he doing he's unfolding this
[1:25:24] mystery of his coming
[1:25:26] in Bride form
[1:25:28] where he will Tabernacle in his children
[1:25:31] now just as much as Moses we can say was
[1:25:34] faithful in all my house and Paul we
[1:25:36] read of that last week in the book of
[1:25:37] Hebrews
[1:25:38] but you understand that even when Moses
[1:25:41] stood there before pharaoh
[1:25:43] and Pharaoh could have all of them
[1:25:45] Jenny's and jambres withstood them and
[1:25:47] everything else
[1:25:49] but Moses in the midst of that time
[1:25:51] remember when Pharaoh said you go tell
[1:25:54] him to make bricks without straw
[1:25:57] people complained
[1:26:00] Moses thought boy this was going to be a
[1:26:01] great Revival he finds out he's about
[1:26:03] ready to get fried
[1:26:05] what does Moses do something different
[1:26:07] than what he did before
[1:26:09] he went to God
[1:26:12] he didn't run away and say
[1:26:14] I guess that was some wild thought no
[1:26:17] it was he had met God
[1:26:20] and what had been wrote upon his life
[1:26:22] was that revelation
[1:26:24] it was wrote there to where that even
[1:26:27] when Moses was standing before God Moses
[1:26:30] couldn't even get away from the calling
[1:26:32] of God he made every excuse why he was
[1:26:37] not a fit candidate
[1:26:40] that's what the presence of God does it
[1:26:42] reminds us of that we are nothing we can
[1:26:44] do nothing Lord we need you
[1:26:48] right but here Moses this is what's
[1:26:50] different I believe this fits very much
[1:26:52] to you and I the faithfulness was not
[1:26:54] that Moses oh he should not have went
[1:26:56] and cried out to God no he did he went
[1:26:58] to the right Source he went to the Lord
[1:27:00] and said Lord but I thought you brought
[1:27:01] me down here to deliver them but you see
[1:27:04] God doesn't give the time frame God
[1:27:06] doesn't have to give all the logistics
[1:27:07] God just said this is my word this is
[1:27:11] the season well what's all the
[1:27:13] increments this day this week this month
[1:27:15] no it's my time to fulfill the word just
[1:27:18] stand faithful Moses
[1:27:21] how do I stand faithful just stand up on
[1:27:23] what I've revealed to you
[1:27:26] he went to the right source
[1:27:28] I think many times that's the things
[1:27:29] that for us Lord help me to go to the
[1:27:32] right source let us go back to the right
[1:27:34] Source go to God
[1:27:37] let me read this here in closing I love
[1:27:39] this scripture Nehemiah chapter 9 verse
[1:27:41] 7. this is another one in the Old
[1:27:42] Testament I want you to watch how this
[1:27:43] is wrote of Abraham Thou Art the Lord
[1:27:46] the god
[1:27:47] who did his choose Abram
[1:27:51] and brought us him forth out of UR of
[1:27:55] the chaldees and gavest him
[1:27:57] the name of Abram
[1:28:00] do you read anything in there that
[1:28:02] Abraham did
[1:28:03] no you chose him you brought him and you
[1:28:07] gave him
[1:28:10] so was Abraham just walking around and
[1:28:12] God just picked him up and putting him
[1:28:14] down no
[1:28:15] but he was yielding
[1:28:17] even in times where Abraham went down to
[1:28:21] Egypt
[1:28:22] the heart in the land like a maybe Young
[1:28:25] new Christian it got hard man he went
[1:28:28] down to Egypt that didn't change God's
[1:28:30] choose
[1:28:32] see to the rest of the church it'd be
[1:28:35] that guy's backslid
[1:28:38] because a church can see that he went
[1:28:39] down to Egypt
[1:28:40] but
[1:28:42] God deals with Abram's heart he ain't
[1:28:45] gonna let Abraham get away with it
[1:28:46] Abraham's going to repent
[1:28:48] God deals with his heart to bring him
[1:28:50] into a place of repentance
[1:28:52] is that right now watch this this word
[1:28:54] that's used in verse 8. mama
[1:28:57] and found us I love this his heart
[1:29:02] faithful before thee
[1:29:06] and made us the Covenant with him to
[1:29:09] give the land
[1:29:10] the Canaanites hidites amorites
[1:29:12] parasites jebusites gurga sites to to
[1:29:14] give it I say to his seed and has
[1:29:16] performed thy words for thou art
[1:29:18] righteous
[1:29:21] you know sometimes Abraham's actions
[1:29:23] didn't match the promise
[1:29:26] but in his heart
[1:29:28] he was ready to repent remember thou
[1:29:30] Hast found us his heart faithful so
[1:29:34] there's no way to say there's no way
[1:29:36] that any person could say my heart is
[1:29:39] faithful and actions speak contrary
[1:29:42] right
[1:29:43] so faithfulness itself remember the
[1:29:46] commentary when wrong when Paul would
[1:29:48] write in the Book of Romans Paul would
[1:29:50] write what God saw in Abraham
[1:29:54] is that right
[1:29:55] and James would write about what
[1:29:59] the outside world soul
[1:30:02] right
[1:30:04] well you know remember it it it what it
[1:30:06] had to be there had to be a reflection
[1:30:08] whatever that God saw in Abraham was now
[1:30:11] become visible to the rest of those that
[1:30:14] would be around it's just like when
[1:30:16] Moses went down to Egypt God knew what
[1:30:19] was in his heart
[1:30:20] but his faithfulness in his actions
[1:30:25] was a witness to pharaoh
[1:30:29] it was a witness to Pharaoh because it
[1:30:32] was wrote on Moses heart
[1:30:34] and here was Abraham's standing that
[1:30:37] even in the midst when he was wrong he
[1:30:39] was willing to repent what God revealed
[1:30:42] what God saw in Abraham God saw his
[1:30:45] faithful heart and now I think of it man
[1:30:48] saw the display of the faithfulness that
[1:30:50] God saw in his heart through his works
[1:30:52] it was the works and that's why when we
[1:30:54] understand it's not by works that were
[1:30:57] saved but remember Faith itself without
[1:31:02] works is dead
[1:31:06] that's the Bible
[1:31:08] is that right Jesus said who said that
[1:31:11] he says uh you know in John 14 12 that
[1:31:14] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:31:17] do shall he do also
[1:31:19] a faithfulness to the word that's what
[1:31:23] his life produces
[1:31:26] in our lives and this is why with
[1:31:28] Abraham I love that scripture he found
[1:31:31] us his heart faithful
[1:31:34] and you know Abraham look at his heart
[1:31:38] it only increased it became more visible
[1:31:43] as time went on
[1:31:47] now remember when Abraham's Divine
[1:31:49] commentary brother Ronnie mentioned this
[1:31:51] we're speaking on Sunday as well in the
[1:31:53] grace of God when God wrote Abraham's
[1:31:55] commentary
[1:31:57] he never wrote
[1:31:58] all of Abraham's mistakes
[1:32:05] but he wrote he staggered not
[1:32:09] at the promise of God through unbelief
[1:32:12] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[1:32:16] God
[1:32:18] this is the testimony of Abraham's seed
[1:32:22] oh my
[1:32:24] that's my desire I I believe in my heart
[1:32:27] I believe that that I'm one of his don't
[1:32:30] you believe that
[1:32:31] and that's the desire that within its
[1:32:33] all when men are many times do we we
[1:32:35] hear it even in this time and day and
[1:32:37] age we're living in sometimes you know
[1:32:38] when things will you know we'll hear say
[1:32:40] well God looks on the heart but whatever
[1:32:41] is in the heart will come out
[1:32:44] so whatever comes out is what's in here
[1:32:47] right the scripture said man is not
[1:32:50] defiled by what's coming in
[1:32:53] man's defiled by what's already in him
[1:32:58] is that right
[1:32:59] so there that that's where the cleansing
[1:33:01] there of the heart but the thing
[1:33:03] foundest his heart faithful
[1:33:06] through everything
[1:33:09] they're every up through every down
[1:33:12] through everything he found us his heart
[1:33:14] faithful and faithfulness is being able
[1:33:17] to stand upon God's word and face to
[1:33:21] face with the word even when it takes to
[1:33:25] hide off our back
[1:33:28] even like Abraham when it was hard for
[1:33:32] him to separate from lot
[1:33:36] Hey listen lot wasn't some guy who was
[1:33:38] running around and running out here
[1:33:40] running out there remember Lord himself
[1:33:42] he was a penny
[1:33:44] but he was hindering
[1:33:47] the promise in Abraham's life
[1:33:51] and so God listen this Abraham cannot
[1:33:53] brag on this
[1:33:55] God allowed it to get tough tight and
[1:33:58] sticky
[1:34:00] to where Abraham realized this can't go
[1:34:03] on any longer
[1:34:06] if we could call up Abraham today he
[1:34:08] would say thank you Lord for allowing
[1:34:10] that situation it was hard it was hard
[1:34:12] to separate but I'm grateful that God
[1:34:14] gave me Grace to be able to see it for
[1:34:15] what it is I wonder how many times
[1:34:17] Abraham went to sleep and he made up in
[1:34:19] his mind I'm going to go tell a lot
[1:34:20] tomorrow I'm going to go do this I'm
[1:34:22] going to do that when tomorrow came here
[1:34:23] was lot again a lot at The Breakfast
[1:34:25] Table and everything else I'm gonna tell
[1:34:27] you what I'm going to tell a lot again
[1:34:28] everything seems I'll tell you what Lots
[1:34:29] really coming along a lot really seems
[1:34:31] really good and all of a sudden there
[1:34:32] would be something else come up but
[1:34:33] eventually Grace was given for Abraham
[1:34:36] to remain faithful to the promise so you
[1:34:40] understand when Abraham separated from
[1:34:43] lot it wasn't that lot was getting on
[1:34:45] his nerves it was that Abraham began to
[1:34:49] recognize this relationship is a
[1:34:54] hindrance to the promise that I've been
[1:34:57] given
[1:34:58] I tell you friends when we can evaluate
[1:35:00] things in that way with relationships
[1:35:03] and I'm talking about even with attitude
[1:35:05] with everything else and we can evaluate
[1:35:08] it how is this affecting the promise
[1:35:10] from coming to pass in my life
[1:35:14] the same with my heart be found faithful
[1:35:16] well your heart is found faithful if
[1:35:18] when we can stand on the word of God and
[1:35:19] when we're confronted with it we'll say
[1:35:21] Amen to the word of God
[1:35:23] and say Lord help me
[1:35:25] Lord strengthen Me Lord
[1:35:27] help me Lord Jesus
[1:35:29] that's to be faithful
[1:35:31] is that right
[1:35:33] I think as I come in here and Wednesday
[1:35:35] Thursday night after Thursday night
[1:35:37] and see different ones I mean it might
[1:35:39] seem like brother Samuel you should be
[1:35:41] preaching this on a Sunday this right
[1:35:43] here God knows when to give this
[1:35:46] I'm going to mean to sometimes I
[1:35:48] understand that people stream but I'm
[1:35:49] going to say this right now Friends The
[1:35:51] Rapture itself is for the faithful
[1:35:53] faithfulness is not based on our
[1:35:56] convenience
[1:35:57] we do not serve God on what's convenient
[1:36:00] because the Rapture itself is not going
[1:36:02] to be at a convenient hour
[1:36:05] are you with me the Bible says that day
[1:36:08] that he came in an hour when they
[1:36:10] expected him not
[1:36:13] I'll tell you why I come to church
[1:36:15] because I expect him to be here I expect
[1:36:17] him to I expect him to come I expect him
[1:36:20] to speak to my heart I expect him to
[1:36:22] deal with my life but the same there's
[1:36:24] ever times that you feel down or you
[1:36:26] feel weary or you're tired sure I do I
[1:36:28] feel tired many times matter of fact I
[1:36:30] felt really tired and we're in my body
[1:36:32] right now I just preached last night
[1:36:33] down there in Logan Ohio I felt weary I
[1:36:36] felt tired but you know what I know that
[1:36:38] just being here in his presence and to
[1:36:41] hear from him is worth more than
[1:36:43] anything else
[1:36:47] that ain't lifting you or me up friends
[1:36:49] but look is there a blessing in it there
[1:36:53] is a blessing in being faithful
[1:37:00] I think when I look across here on a
[1:37:02] Thursday night no we've come from you've
[1:37:04] come from your jobs you come from tools
[1:37:06] come from the week come from everything
[1:37:07] and here you are moving right through it
[1:37:09] and it's not easy
[1:37:11] your minds and things through the tolls
[1:37:13] of the week and you're sitting here and
[1:37:15] trying to press right through and say
[1:37:16] God I know you got something for me
[1:37:17] tonight your mind you've got tools you
[1:37:20] got cares that are upon your heart
[1:37:21] burdens that are on your heart you're
[1:37:23] weary you're tired from the 12s of the
[1:37:25] day I don't care if you're retired you
[1:37:26] fought Devils all day long
[1:37:28] is that right sometimes you fight
[1:37:31] tormenting spirits of sickness and here
[1:37:33] you are standing not to be seen but what
[1:37:37] is it is faithfulness
[1:37:40] I'm glad that he didn't say I can't
[1:37:42] carry the cross I can't go it's not
[1:37:45] convenient
[1:37:47] but I'm glad
[1:37:50] and surely the cross that I have to bear
[1:37:52] you have to bear it can never be
[1:37:53] compared with his cross yet he asked us
[1:37:57] and he spoke about our cross
[1:37:59] more than his own cross
[1:38:01] I say God let us find our heart faithful
[1:38:03] if our heart is out of line and anywhere
[1:38:04] let us find let us find our heart
[1:38:06] faithful
[1:38:07] oh God let me be faithful let it be said
[1:38:09] when it's all said and done the desire
[1:38:12] of my heart is that God can say he's
[1:38:13] faithful
[1:38:16] brother Samuel that guy had a lot of
[1:38:19] shortcomings yeah but his heart was
[1:38:20] faithful
[1:38:23] her
[1:38:24] oh she had she had there was a lot of
[1:38:26] shortcomings about her life
[1:38:28] but she was faithful faithful
[1:38:31] yeah because see all you saw
[1:38:33] was maybe right here but you didn't see
[1:38:36] her heart moving back in and that's why
[1:38:37] you're still standing
[1:38:40] you understand me that's why you're
[1:38:41] still standing is because of his
[1:38:45] faithfulness in your heart
[1:38:51] let's pray
[1:38:52] father
[1:38:55] Lord God how we thank you for your mercy
[1:38:58] Lord
[1:38:59] thank you for your goodness Lord
[1:39:03] and Lord Jesus
[1:39:06] truly Lord you are faithful
[1:39:10] Lord God I never I could never be able
[1:39:13] to look at it or try to compare neither
[1:39:16] do you ask us to try to somehow compare
[1:39:20] to your faithfulness
[1:39:22] but Lord God the desire is
[1:39:25] is that Lord God you bring forth
[1:39:28] of faithfulness
[1:39:29] in our lives Lord
[1:39:32] as we've been looking at this for some
[1:39:34] time where job could say
[1:39:37] my foot hath held his steps
[1:39:41] it's kept his way
[1:39:45] this was not the first trial that job of
[1:39:47] first test this was a very big one
[1:39:50] that job had been through many tests and
[1:39:52] trials before
[1:39:55] oh God I pray
[1:39:59] Lord Jesus
[1:40:01] job himself was a heart that was
[1:40:04] faithful Lord that you found faithful as
[1:40:06] a matter of fact
[1:40:08] the reason that trial then that test had
[1:40:10] come
[1:40:12] because you were bragging
[1:40:16] to Satan
[1:40:18] about job
[1:40:20] of what a perfect and upright man that
[1:40:23] he was
[1:40:26] Lord God you were bragging on one of
[1:40:29] your children
[1:40:31] one of your sons
[1:40:33] I think of it you didn't brag on his
[1:40:35] wife that way you didn't brag on his
[1:40:37] children
[1:40:38] but you bragged on him
[1:40:41] and Lord God there was a faithfulness
[1:40:43] there was an entrustment
[1:40:45] it shows us Lord
[1:40:47] that every test or trial that you permit
[1:40:50] to come our way
[1:40:52] it's because the Lord is your Prophet
[1:40:54] would tell us you got confidence in US
[1:40:59] Lord God
[1:41:00] there's things the Lord that you see
[1:41:03] it's so clear over time as we go on what
[1:41:06] you see in US is so much deeper than
[1:41:09] what we can see
[1:41:10] Lord by Faith Lord God is I believe and
[1:41:14] I believe God's standing here there's
[1:41:15] other believers that can witness with me
[1:41:17] Lord God we believe Lord that we are a
[1:41:22] part of you we're a part of that word we
[1:41:25] can Lord give witness to your working in
[1:41:28] our life of how that you have changed
[1:41:30] this Lord from Death unto life the Lord
[1:41:33] Jesus we find ourselves
[1:41:35] looking to you which we should we're
[1:41:39] made Lord as sheep to be dependent upon
[1:41:41] you Our Shepherd we find no identity in
[1:41:45] anywhere else Lord there's nothing that
[1:41:47] can make our life clear or the mystery
[1:41:50] of it outside of you Lord
[1:41:53] now father
[1:41:56] you know Lord got it our needs Lord even
[1:41:59] here tonight
[1:42:00] Lord you know our hearts Lord
[1:42:04] father
[1:42:05] I pray that God that you would help us
[1:42:07] Lord
[1:42:09] I want to be found
[1:42:11] faithful Lord
[1:42:13] I don't want to be Lord I don't want to
[1:42:15] be faithful according to my own thoughts
[1:42:17] I want to be faithful according to your
[1:42:19] word
[1:42:21] I don't want to be like Lord God that
[1:42:22] like that story many times we hear and I
[1:42:25] don't mean to the Lord say something to
[1:42:27] be light
[1:42:28] but it's like that story of The
[1:42:30] Emperor's New Clothes
[1:42:32] he was so psyched out
[1:42:35] by a person who came to deceive him
[1:42:38] and he walked around with no clothes on
[1:42:40] whatso all but yet he was made to think
[1:42:45] he had clothes on
[1:42:47] Lord God we do not want to think in our
[1:42:51] own thoughts but Lord to recognize Lord
[1:42:54] that the word declares in our life
[1:42:58] faithfulness Lord
[1:43:00] and it also
[1:43:02] shows us our weak places Lord
[1:43:05] and that in itself is also to display
[1:43:10] faithfulness in our hearts
[1:43:13] what will we do when we are confronted
[1:43:15] with our weak places Lord because that's
[1:43:17] not one area that's comfortable to us
[1:43:21] when weak places are pointed out
[1:43:24] the world out there calls it
[1:43:25] constructive criticism
[1:43:28] when to be able to pick this apart to
[1:43:31] try to make you better
[1:43:33] but Lord I'm glad you don't come to tear
[1:43:35] us down to leave us make us feel like
[1:43:38] nothing
[1:43:39] but you come Lord God by your word and
[1:43:42] father is we're beholding your character
[1:43:45] your nature your life your person
[1:43:48] Lord God is we're beholding you
[1:43:51] Lord it challenges Our Lives
[1:43:54] oh God I want to I want to match what
[1:43:57] I'm beholding
[1:43:58] I want my life to match this word more
[1:44:01] than anything Lord God
[1:44:03] Lord God I want my weak places Lord I I
[1:44:06] want to surrender them to you Lord I
[1:44:08] don't want to make it
[1:44:09] s for them I want to surrender them to
[1:44:11] you Lord so that you can pour your
[1:44:13] strength in there Lord God
[1:44:16] oh granted Lord I don't want to make
[1:44:18] excuses for him we don't want to make
[1:44:20] excuses but Lord God help us Lord to
[1:44:23] submit and surrender our weaknesses and
[1:44:25] our weak places and those to you Lord
[1:44:28] God that you might pour yourself in
[1:44:30] those areas because as your Prophet said
[1:44:33] you pour yourself in and then use
[1:44:36] yourself to accomplish the job
[1:44:40] oh God help us not to complain
[1:44:43] Lord God for the weaknesses sometimes we
[1:44:46] get so caught up within that Lord
[1:44:47] looking at our weaknesses looking at our
[1:44:49] frailties
[1:44:50] but Lord God the weaknesses and the
[1:44:52] frailties are only opportunities for the
[1:44:54] greatness of God to be made manifest in
[1:44:57] our life help us to see it that way Lord
[1:44:59] I'm asking you Lord help me to see it
[1:45:02] that way help us Lord but God for when
[1:45:04] we can see it that way that Lord that we
[1:45:07] can
[1:45:07] submit ourselves even more fully to you
[1:45:10] to realize the Lord
[1:45:13] that we can't do nothing without you
[1:45:16] we want to be found faithful Lord
[1:45:19] I believe Lord of those that when it
[1:45:21] says that they will return with you
[1:45:24] coming back from the marriage supper of
[1:45:26] the Lamb
[1:45:28] they that would ride with you
[1:45:31] are called The Chosen
[1:45:34] and
[1:45:36] faithful
[1:45:38] they're called that
[1:45:40] if there's one thing Lord that we want
[1:45:42] to be called
[1:45:43] I want to be called faithful
[1:45:46] I want to be called faithful you call
[1:45:48] Moses faithful Nehemiah broke into that
[1:45:51] inspiration and said you found us
[1:45:54] Abraham's heart faithful
[1:45:57] Lord God
[1:45:58] if there's nothing else that can be said
[1:46:01] about us
[1:46:02] let it be said they were faithful
[1:46:06] in all that I placed in their life
[1:46:11] they never deviated they never backed up
[1:46:14] sometimes they maybe have went a long
[1:46:16] time they went around things tried to
[1:46:18] bypass this tried to pass that but when
[1:46:20] it all came said and done
[1:46:22] they came to a faithfulness
[1:46:25] to stand in every aspect of the word
[1:46:29] and allow the word
[1:46:31] to mold them
[1:46:33] help us Lord
[1:46:35] help us that the Loyalty of our heart
[1:46:38] can beat this material out Lord God
[1:46:42] help us Lord I pray in Jesus name
[1:46:45] amen
[1:46:50] you loving tonight
[1:46:55] you know it's just it's simple little
[1:46:57] things
[1:46:59] we look at Abraham we look at each one
[1:47:01] of them and say wow
[1:47:03] if I can be mentioned like them you can
[1:47:05] be
[1:47:07] remember what God values
[1:47:09] is faithfulness
[1:47:12] whatever that God has revealed to you
[1:47:14] the word that God has given to you
[1:47:17] you realize even in
[1:47:20] one of the parts within scripture
[1:47:23] we didn't get to it tonight but one of
[1:47:24] the very first Parts in scripture where
[1:47:26] it speaks of how that God is faithful
[1:47:28] for he is faithful the very next
[1:47:30] scriptures
[1:47:32] goes into forsaking not to assemble
[1:47:35] yourselves together
[1:47:37] sometimes the things that we can look at
[1:47:39] is though ah that don't matter that much
[1:47:43] but it doesn't matter that much to who
[1:47:47] it matters to God
[1:47:48] [Music]
[1:47:50] I wonder if we would take that kind of
[1:47:52] an outlook on any other promise
[1:47:54] now
[1:47:56] it don't matter that much whether a
[1:47:57] Rapture comes or not
[1:47:59] I don't think it matters too much
[1:48:01] whether or not God still heals the sick
[1:48:02] I don't think it matters too much
[1:48:04] whether God still pours out the Holy
[1:48:06] Ghost it does matter
[1:48:08] and if it matters for every one of them
[1:48:10] promises he's faithful
[1:48:12] to fulfill all his word
[1:48:16] say God help me
[1:48:18] help me
[1:48:19] help me oh my don't you love him
[1:48:23] he's here
[1:48:24] he's here to minister to our lives to
[1:48:26] bring about that faithfulness in our
[1:48:28] lives
[1:48:29] there's things that I'm sure you can
[1:48:31] look at in your life right now I can
[1:48:33] look at and if God tarries we will look
[1:48:35] back and look back to even this night
[1:48:37] and say my
[1:48:40] God's brought me from there to where I
[1:48:42] am now
[1:48:43] maybe certain things that you struggle
[1:48:46] with or this or that but then God
[1:48:48] through him by submitting to his word
[1:48:52] him shaping and molding your heart what
[1:48:54] is that that's faithfulness
[1:48:55] and it brings about faithful reactions
[1:48:58] and you can look back and say
[1:49:01] God you brought me from there to where I
[1:49:03] am now what is that that's Faithfully
[1:49:08] giving ourselves to God I tell you or me
[1:49:11] I can never make out of myself what God
[1:49:13] can
[1:49:14] but if I can just let go and let God
[1:49:16] have his way
[1:49:18] God can bring forth
[1:49:20] amen God bless you tonight let's stand

[1:54:54] know
[1:54:56] I think
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:01] I don't have all the answers to the
[1:55:05] questions of my life
[1:55:09] but I know in whom I have believed
[1:55:16] He Knows My Name
[1:55:19] is
[1:55:23] every move that I make every cheer that
[1:55:29] I cried
[1:55:32] and he knows my name when I move away by
[1:55:38] the pain
[1:55:40] and can't see the light of day
[1:55:44] I know I'll be just fine cause he knows
[1:55:51] my name every step that I take every
[1:55:58] move that I make
[1:56:01] every tear that I cry
[1:56:06] He Knows My Name
[1:56:10] and I'm overwhelmed by the pain
[1:56:14] can't see the light of day
[1:56:18] I know I'll be just fine
[1:56:23] cause he knows my name

[1:56:53] on the road to Emmaus
[1:56:58] three men walked that way
[1:57:02] as they reach their destination the two
[1:57:08] men as the third to stay
[1:57:13] and as they talk together
[1:57:17] and breaking bread and pouring wine
[1:57:23] I finally now realize the Simplicity of
[1:57:31] his sight and how could he desire
[1:57:38] to have fellowship with me
[1:57:43] there must be something more Within
[1:57:48] that only he
[1:57:52] [Music]

[1:58:46] a picture that's been hanging there
[1:58:50] until now I had never
[1:58:53] seen
[1:58:55] how can he desire
[1:58:59] to have fellowship with me
[1:59:04] there must be something more Within
[1:59:09] that only he
[1:59:12] [Music]
