me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of that kindred Rachel and Leah answered and said unto Him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house are we not counted of him stranger where he has told us and hath quite devoured also our money for all the riches which God had taken from our father that is ours and our children now then whatsoever God said unto thee do then Jacob rose up and said his son and his wife upon camera amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Lord Jesus I'll think for we are all God Lord know that we are under

Lord that you would speak and hear through us O God and father Lord may you just move among us Lord to perform your word Lord in our hearts and our lives tonight Lord father there is no restrictions or God you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord and father we believe this Lord God is your body Lord here upon this earth Lord and father we just give ourselves to you Lord that you would have your way tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen god bless yous your being seated tonight I want to speak to you tonight on thought just continuing a little bit from last weekend and to just take that thought on God permits with a purpose to understand that there's nothing that can come our way as a child of God unless God first permits it God he we know that he permits those things and things to come our way with a purpose in mind even as we look at it here just a little bit I want to deal with it just a little with how that God would permit this time here for or Jacob to arise to get him back into place to get him back into position you find of how that God was already dealing with Jacob's life but yet think of how that Laban was able to come to him and able to persuade him to stay a little bit longer but God here in this time there is not gonna be any more persuasion of him staying any longer as a matter of fact as you read later on down in the scripture God is very affirmative and clear when he tells Laban by a dream I don't want you to speak good nor bad I don't want Jacob to find no refuge in words that you would speak and so how that we find that within it that how that God has already been dealing with Jacob's heart to turn Jacob's heart back to going back home and to see how that God allows as we've looked at it here for some time a countenance and things to turn against Jacob where Jacob begins to notice it and it's taking into a place to where the comfort that Jacob has known from Laban and how that Laban has looked at him before God is removing all the comfort that would further calls Jacob to look back to this a home and now you find how that God speaks directly to Jacob it's not just something where the Holy Spirit is dealing with his heart but God tells him to arise and get back unto the land of thy kindred and finding of how that God is turning then the whole the whole household to where Rachel and Leah that how that they themselves are are looking no longer at where they have known all their life to be home they're no longer looking at this as home but they read they look at themselves now in this place of where they have sojourned and known all this time they look and recognize are we not but strangers dwelling here so there's nothing god is removing all the comfort all around and and we know that when we are looking at this here if I can just just deal with this just a little bit we know that even within this here that when you you think of it of how that God would would even permit the time to arise were Esau you remember was breathing threatenings regarding Jacob and if that had not been think of this would Jacob have ever left the land and you think and say well if he had never left the land you know he was in the land but yet if he had never left there he would have never have met God in Bethel for himself so we would have been there would have been no recollection where God could let him know I am the God of beth-el so God had to allow that to take place you know in times in our life when we look at many times when they the greatest fulfillment of things are are taking place and I'm talking about not only just for the bride as far as a body but even in our own lives where God will permit things to take place that moves us in position when you think of how that even as the time of where of the Lord Jesus and the birth was drawing near to think of how that at this time God would let inspiration move down that would actually calls Herod to say let every man return into the city of his birth and you recognize that even though that was something that was political that was given but yet within it God allowed and permitted the influence to come upon Herod that in order that Mary and Joseph would come back into that place that the scripture might be fulfilled there are things that God has desire to be fulfilled in our life and there is a certain position and now sometimes we look and say well is it here is it there but it's it's more in our lives with a condition that God would have in our lives a position of our heart a position of our mind a position of our spirit sometimes there are things that God has within the physical the localities and all those things we we see that even within how that God would have the Prophet go west but I want to deal with this tonight in looking at how that you know the the the Prophet Hosea picks this up in I Hosea six and I'm not gonna dwell very long upon this but to think of how that the Prophet would give the unction and prophesy wherein that this would be the echo that would be among the the the elected Jews of God and the Jews coming back into the homeland we're in that they would say come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us for he had smitten and he will bind us up and after two days he will revive us and in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight and then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain and as the ladder in the former rain unto the earth and think of even when you you you look at these things of how that God had made a promise every time when Israel would be exiled from the land yet God would lay it forth in his word that there indeed would be a return but yet the return itself was not something that was just by mere intellect of looking and saying well this is a time but there's God always in his time when it's time for his word to be fulfilled not only are there signs that correspond with that but in order to recognize those signs and able to see where we're at it takes the unction of the Holy Spirit and Friends it brings it down to this without that unction of the Holy Spirit and there being a receptive part in our life and ordained for this moment we could see a lot of signs and yet not know what it means to us because you can talk to many people in the world and they know there's people you can talk to and they'll tell you we're in the end time they'll tell you we're in the coming of the Lord but you see there has to be something that's able to interpret for you let me just say it like this it's like being in a mall and where you want to know I want to get to this store well you know I know I'm in a mall I don't need nobody to tell me I'm in a mall but where I need to know if in order to get to the store I didn't want to go to I need to know where I am and if I know where I am and I can see then on a map where I need to go to I can find my way there and that's the way the Spirit of God is lets us know by way of his word where we're at that's why that the message that God has sent in this endtime is not just another message but it is the very message of the atonement that lets you and I know who we are where we are and where we're going hey man it has already is that we're certainly and it declares it has a meaning to you and I the message is not doctrines to you and I it is not teachings to you and I the message is the person of Jesus Christ revealed to us in this hour it stirs our hearts unto him because listen friends many can love the doctrines and yet not love him they can meet doctrines and yet not meet him this is not about doctrines this is about him the Bible said to receive the love of the truth amen that's where when we look at this of how that God would permit that this would this would begin to resonate within the hearts of the Jews and how that you know brother Anna will pick this up and he talks about how that God would you know permit the things to happen he talks about the bitter Pierce of persecution that coming against Israel and and any you know it when you look at it you you find everything of how that there is sense that is made of it within the word that it's God calling Israel back home to the atonement and to think of it like this that here within this hour that we are living in and in this time of how that the trumpets have sounded those six trumpets have sounded there and the Jews themselves assembling back home this not a sounding that's been a broadcast throughout the world but it's been a supernatural sounding that has alerted the Jews and calling them back to their homeland as I shared with you last week when you can go and you know not just when they were returning back down there from Yemen and and other places of the world but even every year the amount of Jews that are returning back to the homeland under that program they call on the wings of an eagle there are multitudes and multitudes and multitudes of Jews not just a thousand or 2,000 but thousands of them that are returning home why it's their time it's God allowing that and how that everything around them is is driving them into that place because it's there that God will reveal himself to them God will not reveal himself to the Jews over in New York City come on somebody you know place is important it brother random couldn't say you know what God your God anywhere so you can just read real the seven seals right here but God let him know God took everything around him every bit of comfort and God we even have to take in the comfort and the profit going God never let him forget about it for the Prophet said he always makes it hard on me when I come back here God never wanted him to forget what it means to obey the think of this here think of this here you know and you look at that there's many things that can be applied in our life with that but the see of how that within the Jews if if these things had not arose if if the persecution had not come and God allowed those spirits that are released there in revelations line if God had not permitted those spirits to come and begin to influence men like Hitler and Stalin and Mussolini and all of them if God had not allowed those things to come and allow the turning of the tide to where that people themselves would begin to look at the Jews and they would look at him with such detest and they would look on him in despise them if had not allowed that they would have continued to dwell in the lands where they were living but God permitted that that it would turn him from the lands of where they were living to where they no longer felt at home in Germany in Poland and all those places God removed the feeling that this is home he removed that how did God remove that by allowing everything to turn against him and God permitted that to come that way and to think of how that the Prophet in this hour would address this in the third Exodus where he would speak of how that I'm just referring to these places when he would parallel that time and he would parallel it to the time down in Egypt and he would bring the parallel to where that that at that moment in time in that junction of time of where the word was that at that time and the Prophet would address it like this and speak of how that we see denominational churches and so forth pinning the people down and getting so indifferent he says it's really pushing the people out so God bringing his word was closing things to be stirred up to where better denominations were starting to take a stand against the word and there's taking a stand against the word to where the Prophet picks it up and he says that they are being pressured that these believers are being pressured that they must have their name on a book or else they're going to be excommunicated he said but all that is nothing more than the tender hand of Jehovah that's leading them to the Tree of Life God allowed those things to come about because why the recognize that this denomination that this thinking and this is not my home God permitted it to come about to drive and bring that that long in here God is permitting it and unlike unlike that of where Israel themselves as we looked at it last week that brother Branham would tell us in that message the third exit is the where that these centers have people people that's not inspired God will take the laws of the land to move them into position and to find how that it was people that was not inspired but listen friends that is not our plight we are not a people that's without inspiration and I say that with a heart full of Thanksgiving that movie would be moved by the inspiration of Almighty God in this hour we we know where we're going we know who we are we see these things taking place around us and the Word of God becoming more precious and his presence and all of these things were not without the inspiration but inspiration is here leading us all the way back so glad we'll use the natural laws of the land to get things in position of people who are not inspired that's why the Prophet would go on and say in recognizing your day and its message and he would talk about national forces and you'll talk about the spiritual force and he'll speak of how that in the National forces he said it's those national forces that puts Israel back into her homeland it puts her back in her homeland we've seen that of how it he drove them back into that place we're flying the hell he goes on to say it's national force we'll put the church in the World Council of Churches national force but how does that national force come about by demonic influence how is that demonic influence able to touch it God permits God is over it all remember revelations 9 the angel that angel came falling down that had that key to the bottomless pit but in in revelations 10 that angel didn't come falling down that angel descended it was a mighty angel and to see that within this that it's not the national force but it is the very power of God that puts the people in the brown it's not a church it's not a pastor it's not a prophet it's the Holy Ghost and God comes through his ordained channels God comes through and it's God that puts you and I in his bride amen it's not it's not great teaching it's not this it has be God come on the scene and put the people in the bride so within this and how that God would would place this his is children I I want to just just to look at this for a moment because you see we find and we see a lot of things that take place and happen around and you know it's a time that really to be moving on in and if there's ever a time to be consecrated it ought to be this hour and to see that trends that for as the bride of Jesus Christ being his wife then we are not serving him under fear or under that of a browbeating or anything but it's out of love because if it's not out of love there's no faith that corresponds with it because the Bible is clear faith worketh by love and when we're seeing all of these things take place that here you find these these forces are putting then the church and putting Israel in its place but the power of God is putting the people in the bride then if we turn and look at this and bring it down into our everyday lives and to recognize that it's God sovereignly moving upon each of our lives it's God performing his word and dealing with our lives bringing us into the place and position that he has for us so let's look at this just for a few moments here tonight you see in first Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 the scripture says wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there have no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry in that of a powerful thing that God would deal with in this chapter of how that Israel was being tried in their wilderness journey and God would begin this verse here in verse 12 that let not a man think he that thinketh that he standeth I'll take heed lest he fall when when God would bring of this around then he ends the next then he ends that in the verse of 14 fear wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry what is idolatry it's things that are not true it's things that are created by imagination it's vanity it has no life it has no strength and here the scripture is dealing with this that you know when we look at it that every one of us are tested and tried and we will be tested and tried and we will be tested and tried don't let anyone faint but I you know I can't be tested I can't be tried I can't never come to a place to where that I I feel like Oh God Lord I need you this very next moment but yet Paul is letting it be known hey hey God Himself don't ever get to thinking that way don't ever think that you're beyond the ability because you've got to remember it is God who gives you and I the strength to be able to stand it's God who gives us the courage to stand and it's God who brings us through this is where Paul would picked us up in hi I love this this verse thirteen out of that out of the diag lot of how it reads no trial has assailed you except what belongs to man so we're not getting trials that are Oh Lord God you you gave me a trial that's four angels no our trials that we're getting they belong to men now they are beyond our strength an hour an hour man ability but they are here within this time and God is faithful who will not permit you to be tried beyond your ability anybody ever feel like you've been beyond your ability I got both of my hands up there's been many times I feel like it's been beyond my ability and it has been my natural ability my physical ability but not according to the ability that God sees in me and that's what I have to come to and in coming to that ability that's what you have to come to time and time and time again but with the trial look at this but with the trial will also direct the issue that you may be able to bear it in the message I know brother brems says why does God let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God now think of how there's how the Prophet lays us in with Noah there had been no ring until the flood came but after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to flow forty days and nights in a storm and the little ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of promise after he went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation no I didn't see the rainbow before it was after it's after things that God the tribulation those things are able God permits to come away and the Prophet will refer to that poem or that Psalm must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody seas he said we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations lord have mercy I need somebody to help me understand this we asked for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our comforts is just the on the river over and over what we find that this message tell your friends identifying itself as God coming and leading and directing us it's not God who was leading us to to and to uh you know just to a church it's God leading us out of here with a sight that goes beyond this world it's not just something that comes to a place and it stops but it's got to be a sight that he goes beyond it's looking to the Lord and following his leadership because if we're just looking for well when I start coming to church my you know I'm just really expecting a lot of things that changing my things do change things will change absolutely you'll feel the the very low the burden of sin lifted you'll find how God comes down and brings a real cleansing and how that God can step into that life and begin to reflect see him reflect his life through you and I but it does not exempt us from testings and from trials and things that would come our way but there has to be a vision that recognizes that this is only temporary I tell you friends we need that and we need it to be renewed again and again and again because here we are standing in these fleshly Tabernacles our spirit our human spirit and in the inside of us if you met God face-to-face been born of his spirit that part is in contact with God and through the midst of tests through the midst of trials it's working to bring these outer two realms into that subjection and said wait a minute God is on my side hey man I may not have anything around here that I can see to boast in but I will boast in my God all the day long amen you are ordained to take control and master those circumstances by the faith of God look how the look how the scriptures would deal with this let's look at this for a few moments here tonight beloved inverse first Peter 4:12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as you're partakers of Christ's suffering that I don't want to deal with that part of it tonight on rejoice but just to drop it it is that where we are rejoicing is not in the affliction our rejoicing is in the Lord I rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy look at how that James chapter 1 verse 2 my brethren count it all joy when you shall fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience endurance but let patience have a perfect work that completeness that you may be perfect and entire and wanting nothing when I look at this as two things first of all throughout here throughout the entire New Testament of even held that the Lord Jesus himself and I believe it's in John chapter 16 that he would let the church know you're gonna have much tribulation you're gonna have much tribulation in this world in this life it's only temporary sometimes maybe in your life or in our life it seems like eternity but it's only temporary but to see hell that even these believers down through time that God would be able to comfort them and minister to them and direct their lives as he directs us of even how that we are approach the trial how we are to approach the the test which is the temptation that trial that would come our way even of how we would approach it you say brother Samuel what does that matter because if we don't approach it the right way it's gonna repeat and it doesn't work out what is needed in our life so we need God's help we need God's strength we need that understanding within it god help me and give me the strength now I just we just say it right out here tonight but there's not a one of us in here and maybe just even today that when we look at things and we come across things and sometimes we get to a place and we're looking at how seems like everything is going and then all of a sudden there's a bump in the road and if we're not careful we wonder where did this come from I I don't want this bump in the road every one of us I flash just not like bumps in the road I don't know about you how to like them they put the bumps when you're getting off the Turnpike and you've got the bumps and I don't like riding through places they got speed bumps I'll just avoid them I'll go the long way around I don't like bumps none of us like bumps spiritually in the road now don't tell me that you take bumps and trials and say glory to God praise the Lord there's a trial that came my way I know better than that but I bet I do we do have an understanding that God gives us the strength that even in the midst of that time to bring and hold everything together and even in the midst of it to look to the Lord and say lord help me Lord take my hands Lord guide me through this Lord direct me through it Lord I you know you're not the author of confusion you know what you're doing here you know who wants you to look at this here tonight look at how that when this began to happen with Jacob how how Jacobs approach was to all of this Jacobs approach was not a worn out of spite he said in elevating Jacob this is God moving around in Jacobs life to bring him in position to wear that even he could point out to go to his as Leah and Rachel and say you know that I have honored your father I have served him faithfully and in these things and they could recount or even two would go along with that to know his character even in the midst when he says God allowed allowed him but he suffered him not to hurt me God had a way that Lathan could kill him against Jacob but he could not take Jacob's life here was a line a line and to think of how that in the midst of this are our testing our attitude the Prophet he says this in the message masterpiece in prayer he says give us the desires of our heart where we truly have these desires to serve you in these weakening conditions and afflictions and things of the world that's put upon us sometimes to perfect us we've been told that think it not strange that these trials come they're only working out for our good and to perfect us and bring us into that place look at this outlook on the trial this is why they're giving to us to perfect us to perfect us and bring us into that place these great deserts of experience where righteous men are molded into Saints we thank thee for these experiences Lord we wouldn't know we wouldn't know me no lies want to do anything contrary to your will but we pray father that in this will be brought closer to you I believe that would be our prayer it should be our prayer that within every time that Lord in the midst of this bring me closer to you bring let me be drawn closer to you Lord because the trial itself it's permitted by God the test is permitted and to recognize that sometimes we can look and think where did this come from but to know that God permitted it but it comes with a purpose it's not for naught it's with a purpose God has purpose in mind and he knows with each and every one of us those things that could come our way that would triumph what he why is why is God permitting that he's permitting it to temporize to mold us to shape us to perfect us my look at this in the scripture here let's just look at this a little bit on God's oversight on these things in Revelations 2 verse 8 it's writing to that of the angel of the church in Smyrna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive I know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life I want you to think of this in this in this time this this age itself we know that that each age here is a name that is given of a particular City there in Asia Minor and it would hold within that city and that name those characteristics that would describe a spiritual age a time of God dealing with the Gentile with the Gentiles God dealing with his children that in every age God is calling out of every age his children he's making up his body that in this age there it is spoken in that of some erna which some urn itself being that of myrrh and that of bittering and to think that this is an age where of such great bitterness that is being released but it was not bitterness toward the people of the world it was not bitterness toward just everybody but this bitterness was that which was being released toward the children of God the rest of the world remember within these times there they're moving into a time where in their unions and their guilds as it was known in that time where they were tied in and able to obtain you know about being a member of the church and they were able to obtain you know the jobs and everything like that and how that everything that was taking place that even within the midst of this time and all that was taking place yet God's words within the midst of it to this group of people was I know I know I know and to think of how that in the midst of the time bitterness you know is a terrible thing anybody know what I'm talking about I know it by experience bitterness is a horrible thing it can it truly can it can really really move within your life it's it's a it's a bad thing so to recognize of how that within things of bitterness and you know it doesn't take much it just takes a thought getting off in a certain way that's why those things have got to be checked because remember what bitterness is bitterness itself is poison bitterness is not you pouring a glass for somebody else and them drinking it bitterness is you drinking the poison and waiting for the other person to fall over that's bitterness bitterness itself it has a way that it can affect people's lives where everything you get around everything's negative and everything is this and look friends all those things can come it can come in marriages it can come in homes he can come around in churches all of those things we're not exempt from that but bitterness itself it's a place and every one of us know here from the youngest sometimes you've got that when you've got done eaten and you get things that come back up and it comes up your throat and man you're trying to get that taste of those stomach acids it burns your throat you're trying to get it out you try to drink orange juice or whatever more why you don't like the taste of those acids and if you're you know you start looking and thinking wait a minute what did I eat that calls that right there because what it is you don't want that coming up again because it burns like fire that's the way bitterness itself does within a life you realize that even in the midst of tests and trials successive things sometimes things that God would require you and I to be patient with you can look at things sometimes within your marriage you can look at it in your home look at it within the church and you can look at it and want to so put your hands on it and fix it by your own strength you will make a mess out of it every time but patience itself it looks to the Lord and as God Himself you give yourself to that word and say lord help me in the midst of it if this individual there's something about them a wife or husband that needs to be changed in Lord change that part about me of them that bothers me you know that part about you that's the button they can press because it's not God just changing the buttons on them God's gonna change the things that moves in us now God is not going to come down and perform surgery on us and take that part away because within each of our lives the way our personality is which is our temperament which is our makeup the Holy Ghost does not take the temperament or makeup out but the Holy Ghost sets right down in the middle of it has the will in the middle of the will to direct that temperament to direct that life but it does not mean that that temperament cannot get out of line as a matter of fact we need the Holy Ghost to keep our lives in line it's God giving us strength over our domain of Earth right now to rein in that earth because in the Millennium there is promises of rain there's promises where the heathen will get no ready and I believe with all my heart that as a son and daughter of God we have that designer laughter say Lord more than anything I need the rain of God I want the rain of God I want to do of God I want the flow of the presence of God and I want to ensure that I like his right where it needs to be that God is you're pouring yourself out that I'm right there to receive it because if I'm not then I don't get no rain there's no growth in my life and I'm wondering why isn't there growth taking place so God knows how to bring us along and bitterness itself is something that can come sometimes with a result where there is at the same time patience is being formed and yet bitterness itself can come in where that in the midst of us something that is taking place that a person can get bitter and it won't be to where necessarily they'll get bitter on God it can happen sometimes where people can get bitter and people can wonder and question about different things is that right but yet in the midst I remember the man who brother Ram told us about in one of the places of the message and there's multiple places he talks about that man in the Hebrew series to where that the brother who was a minister and so forth he had become so discouraged I don't know what the man had seen there's a lot of things around us that we hear and we see that could discourage us if we allow that to be our focus but I believe that we have received a word from the Lord I believe friends with all my heart this is not something that I'm just preaching to you but I am preaching to you by way of experience to where when there are things that in the midst of the life of things that you want to see change things that you want to see turn but it's not within your physical power to do it but God Himself will bring us to that place to pray and to look to him and trust him that he comes on the scene to fulfill his word every time and if we can have that kind of a relationship if we can be nurtured in that way if we can submit ourselves that way then it cast out any bitterness it cast out any faults that can turn into that bitterness I'll tell you the joy of the Lord is our strength amen there are times when there's things that you know what you know in there and then I have everything in the world just like you to be down and to be discouraged is that right I'm not talking about shame on you for being down Timon you're I'm not talking that way - no that's not what I'm saying what I'm trying to say is is that when you find yourself in the midst of those times and trying times let the Lord be your refuge and say little harder hold my hand Lord God help me Lord God you might say Lord hold my mind Lord help me Lord but my mind is riding light help my spirit Lord I feel like I'm coming to pieces help me Lord and he says I know I know I know as I said bitterness sometimes can come when we don't see change you're seeing things come the way that we want to see it but to think of how that the Prophet he puts it like this in the Sumerian Age he says the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does God does he hold back the persecution does he stim the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering I love that how that the Prophet brings that home down God's not saying I know in a flippant manner God says I know I'm I'm fully mindful not just of the situation I know even in your spirit I know in your body what's what's the profit says what a stumbling-block this is there's so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer I won't ask you to raise your hand but how many times have you how many times of me said God do you still love me I know you're thinking ahead you're going ahead on this quote but let's not let me just say this right here God doesn't love us just by mere words the Apostle John picked this up in first John brethren let us not love in just word only but in deeds let that love be expressive how where is he tying it back to that love that has been expressed to us and is expressed to us over and over with me even out that the Prophet would bring that down he brings it down into the marriage of how that even he says how is your wife going to know that she's a good cook how is she gonna know this how is she gonna know unless you tell her brother sadness she knows but maybe she wants to hear you say it I love to hear the Lord come down and speak to me now friends let me tell you the Lord speaks it's things that God speak to me within men and you know what the majority of everything it deals with right here with this assembly the bringing of the word the ministry and those things like that but within it within it all I still love to hear his voice it dread thrills my soul when God comes down many wakes me up in the morning in the middle of the night or whatever more and it's just something right there that God just speaks to my heart it's a thrill of my life and yet it can be the most trying time that I'm going through it I'm not just talking about even now sin I've just been here you know and when I stepped away from teaching but I'm talking about even in the midst of times of where when I was teaching all those years there were times I was standing right here on Thursday nights standing on Sunday and knowing what I had to face on Monday knowing what I had to face from a Thursday night going into a Friday times of uncertainty things that were coming all around it and situations that were isin just like you do but you know in the midst of it God is faithful to give us the strength that we need to be able to stand in that moment he knows now I could have let that just totally cab beats me down we de had been just a bummer of a service on a Thursday night or on a Sunday or whatever more but you know within it all God by His grace I believe he taught me some things I believe he's still teaching me some things is he teaching you a little bit acum the more a depth of compassion and sympathy were I don't just look on a person and say come on snap out of it man you're the bride of Jesus Christ he didn't just snap out of it it isn't something that just snaps out of your finger because nine times out of ten the people that tell you that they themselves you know when they're wearing a frown and the church said so see God permits things to come our way for what for what reason oh my we're not people without understanding God does not want us to walk without understanding but that you and I would have an understanding where we'd be able to stand there and pray and enter in enter in to that right there I believe that was on my heart think about it look at how that within this there love the Prophet he deals with this of how that their love in itself let me come down here their love they looked at it is that it was a love that meant no suffering they thought it was a love of parental care we're in every in every situation and in everything they they couldn't see that the things that God permitted to happen was with a purpose in mind and God would speak to Israel and let him know they waited didn't I late he sells mountains to waste did not deliver you from Egypt didn't I bring you all this way what's God let him know my love for you as always my approval of you is in me that I would come by your way and reveal myself but I would make known myself and draw you unto myself but to think of how that things work things go brother Bama he makes a statement in and he talks about how that why does he stand by and he says the reason is in Romans 8:17 3:18 if children then heirs and heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together see this is a this is a union husband and wife for better or worse in sickness and in health until unto death we do part it's not about how good it is it's not about how bad it is it's about serving suffer with him do you realize what the suffering with him he's right there walking in the midst of this church he's right there in our lives we're not a part in this this isn't something where and you work this out on your own he's right there with us but say no why don't he just take it away why don't because he knows the purpose that it's working out if God came down every single time and answered every single prayer according to how we prayed it and answered every single thing when we got sick as soon as we prayed the sickness was gone as soon as we would become the most spoiled group of people or the sender but we're children of God your children that are born of your flesh and your genes if you leave them to yourself and don't correct them and step in on every little thing they'd become spoiled but why don't you step in on everything you're tempted your tests why don't you do it because you know there's certain times they need to stand on their own feet there's certain times where they need to be spoken to by somebody else I'm not talking about another dog reprimanding them I'm talking about where they need other things where you have situations that come about where they have things that come their way where you have someone that stands there in school says you know what you're not as smart as you think you are they need somebody to deflate their balloon once in a while you understand what I'm saying friends this isn't meant to be but what I'm saying is that even though in the midst as a parent let me tell you something as a parent even when you know you have things where the Deacons would come in and they have to bring correction and and so forth they've raised children in the church and you can look at and say they're just being picky you can take that attitude in your heart and it'll never do you really good or you can say whom I let stings but you know it's truth and stand right up and back it up I hope somebody's with me tonight it's just like with the teacher in school you can either talk it down to where they look down at that teacher and you can talk it down or you can stand behind and back it up you say brother Samuel that teacher might be ever so wrong but if you go to talking down then they believe it's okay for them to disrespect teachers oh brother Sammy you're just saying that because you're a teacher no I'm saying because that'll transfer from one authority figure to another authority figure to another thirty figure to the pastor you know transfer to God you know transfer to the Prophet you understand what I'm saying these are necessary God trains us and teaches us and is molding us and shaping our character because our character is not a gift the Holy Ghost is the gift of God but character is not a gift money can't buy it money can't buy character character itself is molded and it's made or suffering when it all because in the midst of the fiery trial I'm closing in the midst of the fiery trial it's God allowing the fire from the trial mold to burn out all the dross all the impurities all the things about in our life think of it the Prophet tells us there's no church that's exempt from it there's no believer that's exempt from it but to everything remember everything it comes to the believer trials themselves our seasonal this season shall pass after this season we know comes after the winter comes the spring then the spring gives us that place to where there will be another season coming there are only seasons but it's seasons that there are things that are necessary to happen in this season in order for the next season every part of our life it's God moving us in place and in position molding us shaping us sometimes isn't an amazing how God will allow things to go for a long time my everything is just peachy at the workplane and then God will permit another boss to come in but her permit another worker to come in God will permit maybe a little disturbance to come in there in the home why would God permit that over the seminole that's not God why would God permit those things come about why would God you say oh brother Samuel that was just that was just a you know that was just a wrong spirit that came in influenced him or influenced her but did it bother you how did you respond to it how did you react to it you see God permits those things what's it doing it's God tempering that it's us for us we recognized you know recognizing our weakness recognize that he's our strength don't get focused on the weakness focus on Lord I need you you're my strength mold me shape me make me he's faithful you love him may God help us that all of these things the tests and trials that he permits to come away let him you say Lord bring me into that place Lord in my life and my walk spiritually Lord bring me into that place with you that you are calling me to he's faithful let's bear here anybody like to be remembered in prayer tonight your hands throughout this building my hands up - I wonder if we just couldn't let's all pray together let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord how intimately Lord you speak to us Lord in the midst of that age you said I know good god to think of how that inspiration would flow through that age and the word Lord that was given by the Spirit of God that would drive away the bitterness that would try to overtake the lives of the believers circumstances physically materially that would triumph would even to wear as your prophet would tell us that kind-hearted people in the society in that day that they could Lord be Lord turned against because they were simply kind to the children of God to think about how that the pressure and things would come Lord to wear that there was nothing Lord no kindness were trying to remove kindness Lord from all around them and you permitted that you knew the situation you knew the condition your prophet goes on to tell us Lord in this in this right here he says how that the mind itself of the untutored believer would think how could God not just stop and give in and lavish them with everything Lord I've got to be honest lord I thank you Lord for the understanding that you give us Lord but I realize the Lord Jesus more and more the understanding that you give us is not just something Lord God that we would learn by hearing the Word of God not just by hearing it Lord but there are experiences that must come in our life from learning experiences where that word is is put to a test we're in the midst of those times Lord [Music] it rises up within us remember when I said remember what I spoke remember in my world oh god no the tests of the trials or our flesh our spirit is never one of them but God that inner man it's setting us free Lord [Music] you're strengthening us you're molding us Lord a faith or God that has been deposited there and raised up Lord God I think Lord here tonight [Music] there's testers trials than Lord that we're faced with things that we've come through Lord whether Lord this week this month this year there's things Lord that we can truly say not those those things that were in the pasture know that Lord was some great trials and things in our life but all those prepared a smarty shapeless our faith and we with patients standing there and say he's faithful God how your prophet tells us that sometimes how they right afterward pray for healing Lord would begin to come he said then all of a sudden you begin to sit in and it seems like we're worse he said God will permit that to test us what will we do in that time [Music] Lord we're here tonight confessing that we need you Lord we ask that God I start here and I ask Lord for the entirety of this assembly forgive me lord in the times when I've complained Lord forgive me Lord in the times Lord that I've looked and I've wondered lord I know that Lord even in the midst of those moments Lord that those things the Lord that I had even in those times Lord of Akef Lord he would be turned around he would be turned about I think God of how your prophet he said there in the message go tell [Music] and he began to talk about a condition Lord that had come in his life fear had come in and he was talking about it he said I was a I've always been afraid of failing but you took the lord of circumstance you took a situation and you let him know the doctors tried to bring the fever down to the sinus condition all those things but they couldn't do it and he was looking at it Lord looking at everything and in the midst of that time you spoke to him and you said I've confirmed the furtherance of your ministry your commission but you've got to accept it Lord at that moment he said Lord then I accepted he said immediately he said that sinus condition was broken and it begins to go on and talk about how that Lord the examples of men like Patton and others how that God he took that and began to apply it spiritually in his life and you removed the fear of failure from his life oh my what Satan thought that it would be a demise but right there Lord God you proved yourself faithful more but sometimes situations how things are permitted to come our way nor do we know that there are things that are allowed it shows it brings out of our life those things God that you're wanting that lust Lord to surrender bonus and shapes Lord God you are the great Potter or the clay you know every need you know each situation nor there's hearts behind those hands tonight that have been lifted up or some going right now through the midst of a test what happened to pull their mind in from wondering Lord where they're having to take the word and encourage themselves father to know that in the midst of it you're not the author of confusion [Music] god I pray Lord lead us guide us and direct us Lord everyone Lord your faith directly issue Lord we want to submit to you lord we dream that an everything God in our life will be brought in place in position where it needs to be help us father I pray give strength to your children Lord encourage them Lord Lord as we send moments ago how we love those times when you come down you tell us you love us and I think God of how the Prophet tells us in Corinthians book of Corrections he talks about himself as a husband he said how would it be if my wife a month would go by and she wouldn't tell me that she left me but she comes by he said I would feel something's wrong but he said I'll she'll come by and take my hand and let me know she loves me she appreciates me Lord we want to tell you we appreciate God your voice we appreciate you speaking to us we appreciate your care we appreciate your oversight we appreciate God every test every trial that you've allowed God to come our way it's not the test or the trial it's you it's you Father we thank you Lord God speaking to us Lord thank you Lord from ministry to arts thank you Lord for healing our bodies lord thank you lord the times Lord when we were feeling our spirits Lord just weak and Lord discouraged Lord good father thank you for coming Lord and just dropping a little word dropping Lord like you did for Elijah that little sandwich Lord the Ravens Lord how the gun they would come and feed him to think Lord the angels of God are right here Lord encamped about us Lord oh how we thank you Lord how we appreciate you tonight Lord [Music] strengthen us Lord as your children I pray God our hands are up Lord our hearts Lord before you Lord you'll not leave you don't leave us alone but you said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age what comforts that is to us Lord
