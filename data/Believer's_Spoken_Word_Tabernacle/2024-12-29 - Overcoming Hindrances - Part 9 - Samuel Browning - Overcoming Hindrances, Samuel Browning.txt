shortcomings and we lord stand here Lord to plead the blood of Jesus Christ not our righteousness Lord and we ask that God that you would just L God move in such a special way Lord in our hearts and our lives this morning Lord may your may your presence may as even as the word Goes Forth Lord there's already an atmosphere that's been created here but Lord we think about there Lord in Genesis 1 when the spirit of God after the word was spoken the spirit of God began to move Lord brood over the Earth and begin to bring forth more and more coming in Lord till eventually it got to that of your own image Lord and Lord we ask that may the Holy Ghost may you just brood Lord I pray God as the word is being spoken May Lord I pray father every every bit of doubt and fear may it be melted away

father we pray we commit ourselves into your hands now Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless you let's turn in the scriptures to John chapter 3 and I'm going to begin reading here in John 3 and verse three we were picking up on some of this um last week and I I want to just continue uh upon these upon those thoughts we've been looking at on overcoming hindrances and I want to continue to deal with that aspect today on that of the negative but really dealing with the positive that moves into our life and um you remember we've seen that last week um the picture a lot of us have seen what a negative is and then you've seen the picture that comes from the negative it's really hard if you look just at a negative to be able to see all the details but yet in order for there to be a negative there had to be a picture taken of something somewhere positive like you take a picture of an event or a family picture you had to be there and then when that picture is taken then there's a negative that is made from that we almost have to get out of the digital age for a moment to consider it because we're so used to snapping we've got pictures and submit them to Shutterfly Walmart and whatever more but yet when it still comes down to it believe it or not there are people who still take pictures and there are negatives that are processed in our lives that that negative that part from that positive that was taken that's what God placed in our life even as we come from our mother's womb as a seed of God and then the spirit of God begins to work on our life it brings us into that of birth but we're not fully developed you how many of you remember when they had the polaroid pictures remember that I thought that was the coolest thing in the world and I've seen where they kind of brought some retro things out last year you know around Christmas and man I thought that was great because you know why I didn't have no patience it didn't have to wait it just spit it out and then you know everybody been there Fanning you'd have them all laying on the table and you oh man oh and and that's really how our lives are as a Believer once the the Holy Spirit has brought the new birth in our life we're watching Christ appear in our lives and it's us no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me so I want to read this scripture here out of John 3 Jesus said ex Jesus said unto him to Nicodemus verily verily I say unto the except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but can not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to as I mentioned to you moments ago I'd like to uh just continue to speak on that thought of overcoming hindrances in our lives and one of the things that uh the Lord just so pressed on my heart some months ago is dealing with that thought on negative and it's very it can be sometimes depending on our makeup and even when sometimes even if we seem to be a very positive person there's a lot of things that can come around and sometimes that's very negative and sometimes we can catch ourselves and we begin to speak or think in a negative way and I think of it if if the the Holy Spirit would convict the prophet where he would be able to sit down with his wife and say the holy spirit is grieved within me because I've been thinking negatively then I think that God would would would give us the strength that would help us so that in our lives that it's not to say that we're never going to come into certain times because we're surrounded with negative this this entire body that we have it's it's negative but yet when God has come into our life that's the positive there can be a lot of positive things but friends it's just like with everything else in life it will quickly like James said even it'll corrupt it'll fade away but there's one thing that can never pass away and that's the word of God and that's why that it must be the word of God that comes into our life and that's where the new birth that's what it is the word working with our life dealing with our life bringing us to that place of a real TR True full conversion a real true birth and when the positive of God's own life has come in you know it it becomes so real like that of where you begin to see all around us and the things you know life itself and everything that surrounds it just even at its best brother Brown would say it reminds us of that garbage dump and where you can smell just you know things that decomposing you you see all of that around you see all of this life but there's one thing that moves within the heart of a Believer and and that is when God's own life has come on the inside of us then we're no longer looking just through that of Earthly eyes and we're no longer just confined to that of a negative by the first birth but through the new birth there has now come forth a real true positive and the only positive there is and that's God's word in our life and so with that with that in mind and and looking at the realities of God you know um a common term that we would you know hear about and think about is that of a paradox we can see many paradoxes down through the scriptures we think of that of the Red Sea you think of Noah and building the ark and even of Moses leading out you know the children of Israel and think of the crossing of the Jordan all of those things were great miraculous things and that's what a paradox is it's something that is absolutely incredible but it's true and and the real reality when we look at the even the latter part of this scripture where it speaks of the new birth and New Birth is not something that is actually can even be explained it must be experienced it is an experience that comes from God and I'm not I'm not just talking about there can be many experiences we can have many experiences in the presence of God but this experience is that where it goes down to the soul level and there is an absolute transformation in that life when the all where the things of the world have passed away and you say what do you mean by that it's where the very desire for the things of the world is no longer present but the desire is to live and to serve the Living God that in itself is a miracle the new birth itself is is not something that is schooled into our lives but it is a predestinated experience from the hand of God look all the way down through the scripture you will find that the that when each one had their personal encounter with God it was not a pre-planned event by man it was not something that was schooled into him but it was The Sovereign hand of God that would bring his children that he knew was here like he did with Moses at the burning bush like he did with Noah like he did all the way down through the scriptures all the way up to that of even of the upper room it was all God pre-planting that moment wherein by there would be a miracle that would take place and it is the greatest miracle that can ever happen to an individual you know a person could actually be healed I mean we've seen it I I've witnessed it where where lives that you know that have been able to walk that couldn't walk before that's a great miracle that's a tremendous thing and that is a wonderful reality for somebody who was not able to walk but then could get up and walk but you know if time terries you're either going to go by the way of the Grave or there can come to a time again where a different kind of sickness would hit that body that in it self is a miracle but this miracle where God comes down and changes the very nature of an individual transforms it by his power to match his word that is a miracle that not there's not a devil out of hell that can erase that miracle there's nothing in time that can ever stop that that becomes an eternal work of almighty God so now to think of this you know when we look at it this is why that you know when brother BR would say it like this he would say I believe that every Born Again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves I believe each one of you Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran never had an experience or experiened the baptism of the Holy Spirit you were in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine New Birth and has now received the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is it's a miracle and he said unless that happens you cannot be a Christian there must be a paradox for you to become a Christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and give him a new birth outside of God God Alone is the only one can do it and it's a miracle how that God can take a man's thinking his ways his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it so we are not made we are not the new birth is not something that is manufactured by a church it the the you know a church b a church book has no power to change a man a Creed has no power to change a man this is why that when God would show himself to Zachariah and he would show him of the the lampstands he would show him and he would he would Express to him it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord I tell you friends that that that is exactly the new birth is not something that we have achieved when God has done such a work in our life it is not our achievement we cannot take one credit for it it is not something where we can ever say that we were seeking God if you ever had a desire to serve God it's because God put that desire within you and it was God that was calling out to that desire and it was not what we did it's what we surrendered ourselves to and that never never ceases in our lives even to that of the consummation of the body change will be a surrendering to the will of God so I want to just say say it in this way when the New Birth has come it's the beginning of Miracles because in order for you to believe in miracles you first must become a miracle and the greatest Miracle is when God can take a life that all everything through Society you can pass them through reformatories you can pass them through AA and everything else but you let them get in the presence of God and when they get in the presence of almighty God and God begins to speak to their heart and melt away everything every excuse and every fear and every doubt and every trepidation the raise of his word will melt it away and God moves down and he brings a complete transformation in that life I tell you that's a miracle and it is the beginning of Miracles you hearing me now it's the beginning of Miracles notice the scripture said wherefore Paul said henceforth know we no man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new you know if I paused the service and ran back to the back and got the clothes that I had back there for after I'm finish preaching and I go back there I put those clothes on and I come up here and I step back in the pull pit I'm still the same person I'm just wearing a different outfit of clothes is that right but you see God doesn't want to change the outside that'll come but what God wants to do is not so much it's not a new coat but or or or a new a new coat but God wants to change the person on the inside because when God brings a change down on the inside side that power that Miracle will work its way out in our life and it will show from the inside to the outside that a miracle has taken place is that right it will show that it will display that now remember you know even with the even when you take uh uh uh trees and oak trees and things like that some of the oak trees 30 years before you ever start having you know acorns coming out the sorero C I when I was out there in Arizona just you know maybe now a few months ago and looking at when an arm comes out one arm speaks that it's least been there for 50 years before it'll ever come out and you see these different things even in nature that will testify of how that life and the struggle you know and the growing that takes place but there is a season for everything and that's how it is within the life and the walk of a Believer just as our life and experience of the New Birth has come from the hand of God it's the same way when our lives are surrendered to God God will bring forth himself through our lives so every he's a new creature you know it's the same it's the same uh you know in the same house you know it's just like when others if they're able to recognize you from high school and maybe some of you still got your hair and everything else and maybe you look a lot like your yearbook and people can say hey someone but you know what when when if there's become a change in that person's life I I remember how God God did in my life there could be a lot of things that many people had remembrances of what Sam Browning used to be but when just that moment and then even me testifying and then God testifying through year after year after year it was not something that I had to make but it was a transformation that had happened in my life they recognized the same old t Le but there was new ownership on the inside it's the creative life notice who else can do that it takes the same presence of God that brewed in the beginning there in Genesis 1 to bring forth out of our own lives notice the prophet says it like this in the uncertain sound he talks about that button remember that from last week the little button I talked about he's referring to like a button and he refers to it over and over like a button that's on your shirt when the Holy Ghost has come into a person's life when a man saved that much of him is God that's the little light that comes into him to make him quit doing what's wrong now if you can notice these words if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out you might say how in the world could there still be envy how in the world could there still be malice how could there still be any of those things because it's not on the soul level when the spirit of God is coming down it actually brings such a transformation on the inside of that soul and then through that God equips us as a son and daughter of God and the spirit of God working in our lives and our heart to actually clean out in our heart baggage that's been accumulated whether it's through experiences whether it's through things of raising experiences we've had here uh you know something has happened to us as a child but the spirit of God there is no greater healing in agent than the holy spirit because healing does not come from the outside in healing comes from the inside out is that right when the fountains were all polluted and they were bitter around that City what did Elisha ask for he said bring me a new Cru in other words I don't want the same old Cru that you've been using bring me a new Cru with salt in it and God gave a real true Revelation straight from from the Throne of God and when that is placed in the mouth of those fountains out of it is sweetened yes sir that's the same thing in our lives but notice here's here's the key if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out now it isn't God leaving us alone but he'll deal with us you know you couldn't even know that you had something in this way if he didn't point it out to you and sometimes it's incredible to me it's incredible how God will work with our lives he could right on day one sit there and point everything out in our heart remember this is your soul this is your heart sometimes what it is our heart gets in the way we can get unconfessed sin in the heart we can a lot of different things can be bottled up but we want to have them together we want that of our soul to say to our heart follow me is that right so to notice that that within that and that's where Satan always try to battle right there in the heart after a life has been filled and born of the spirit of God and you might you might look at that and say well how can it be that there's something that I can do as God points it out then that's when we step in under the authority of the Lord scripture on that he said every place that The Souls of your feet shall tread Joshua that have I given you and the Bible also goes on to tell us you will not drive out all the inhabitants at once but you will drive them out little by little as you are able so you you can't you know the new birth does not all of a sudden start off and man I'm completely right there in the promised land completely developed as a mature Christian I'll tell you what the prophet called that he called that nonsense he said there's a lot of false teaching going on that says today he said we're here we are as babies and then here we are born again tomorrow were mature Sons and Daughters of God he said that is nonsense well he said it I'll say the same thing it's nonsense it's nonsense that the enemy would like to try to wear you down and beat you down and keep you in a place to where you're always wondering in your life and in your walk with God but let me tell you something when God has transformed your life it is a miracle that you can't even explain you don't even know how it happened but you were there when it happened and you say how do I know because you have passed from Death unto life how do I know what were your desires before and what are your desires now that's how you know that's a word answer right not because I spoke in tongues not because I ran not because I done that that all can be impersonated the rain falleth on the just and unjust it can fall on my upon the flesh it can fall on the spirit and give a one wonderful experience of rain but it's got to come down to the soul remember the Mana they collected which was a type of the Holy Spirit God's word coming straight from heaven when they collected it they were told consume it all in the day whatever's left burning with fire cuz if you don't it'll get maggots in it but they picked up some that fell on the first day and they put it in a golden om but they put it in a special place they put it in the holiest of holies under the president of the shik glory and you know what it never did contaminate it it shows when the Holy Spirit it moves gets down to that soul level and produces a change I'm telling you the holy spirit will never ever contaminate that life it'll never break away you are sealed the Bible says Ephesians 1 Ephesians 4 you are sealed until the day of redemption it's not you keeping you it's God keeping his word in your life my now if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out that that little button like of the light and power of God notice that little button like of the light and power of God will keep growing growing growing growing crowding out unbelief anybody had something in your house you realize and you might think you know I'd like to put this in a living room you finally realize where we going to put it I mean if we put we bring another coffee table in here somebody's going to have it on their lap or either going to move out a chair and it's got to go there oh this picture would look beautiful are we going to take one down and put another one up you see what happens is the holy spirit has you continue to receive the word what's happening the word is actually listen to me it's casting out the hold upon your life it exposes the enemy and as it cast it out it's God giving you the strength to be able to stand with the word and take the side of the word and as you receive that word it actually crowds out unbelief to where when unbelief or something would want to come back it has no place to come back to sorry that place has been filled that's what we want we want our lives to be filled with more of god notice he says you don't do it by ex exhortations of bodily exercise you do it by a Sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you now so it isn't you know us working ourselves into a place man I oh Lord has dealt with my heart on this and man I really got to I tell I really got to do this no it's not bodily exhortations it's not that of bodily exercise of of exhorting ourselves and trying to work ourselves into something you never seen an oak tree or anything else out there saying man I oh I I just got to produce these acorns I you know the Sor oh I just got to shoot forth these arms and oh you know the you know there of the clam oh I just got to produce a pearl they're not struggling that it already lays there all they have to do is yield draw from the nutrients that are in the soil receive from the sunlight and that will take place in their lives now notice what he said he said a Sanctified means a set aside life isn't it amazing how the enemy will always if he can't keep you from the truth he tries to push you on if he can't hold you back one thing he'll try to do is try to get our life filled with so many other things the enemy can look down and hear oh my here the soul can be sealed away but then he'll try to come in whether it's through church problems or whether it's through family problems or or things on the job or whatever more and he'll try to move and find places in that heart that's why Paul told the Ephesian believers who was a type of those taking the promised land you and I it was speaking and it said give no place to the devil meaning that there is possibilities of giving place to the devil anybody ever said something or done something you had to repent for yes all right that that's giving place to the devil but you know what as soon as you repent and it's there in your heart and you repent you are absolutely identifying the enemy and as you repent and give yourself to God they saying Lord I don't want any Retreat for the enemy to come back to and then we continue to grow even from that so it's a consecrated life unto God a consecrated to him now notice in the Scriptures it says in sec in Titus Chapter 3 and verse 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done like I said in the Book of Ezekiel or book of Isaiah when God looked upon and would look upon them he would said your Works your righteousness is nothing but filthy rags when they went about to as far as trying to do something on their own they were instead of yielding to God's way God's word you say how is that yielding when it looks like this person is doing the same thing as this person remember God looks on the heart you can have two people doing the same thing but it's only received when it comes from the heart that's right right you can have two people worshiping right in church but it's only received when it comes from the heart that's why when God chose David he was a man after God's Own Heart he wasn't a perfect man but he was after God's Own Heart oh my that's why we want our heart to be in it I don't want to just be at church I want my heart to be in it I don't want to just serve God I want my heart to be in it like when Paul Raider gave his wife a kiss and walked out of the walked out of the house and he turned he heard her crying he felt so bad he walked back in and he gave her another kiss and somebody said what was the different he said the second one had some feeling to it not by work works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing watch this now of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life now when we look at this on the washing I want you to watch this and I'm going to read in the Amplified here it said in verse 5 he saved us not because of Any works of righteousness that we had done remember the whole thing it's by by grace through faith that you are saved not of works works are only an appreciation of the grace that has come your way amen right why why do we dress the way we do why do we you know and praying and and giving ourselves why do we come to the house of God why do we give oursel we are doing it not out of law not out of a mandate we're doing it out of an appreciation for the great gra that's coming on our lives so this is what Titus is writing about that it wasn't it was God who came and sought us out so we know it's it's always about yielding everybody say yielding yelding that word's going to be very important here this morning notice by the cleansing bath of the new birth which is regeneration so God coming down on the inside in our life and bringing an absolute change within our lives it's God coming down on the inside and you know God isn't altogether the way God is approaching the new birth it's not he's trying to get somebody they'll be still be they'll be good enough he gets them cleaned up enough and then he moves inside no God on listen he provides his own Dwelling Place he is Jehovah Gyra is that not right he provides his own Dwelling Place when he told Moses and them let the let let them make me a sanctuary let me tell you they didn't come up with a gold they didn't come up with the wood that was already here the Bible said in the Book of Psalms that the Earth is the Lord's with the fullness thereof it might be under certain people's possession but it actually belongs to the Lord if you can look at it today even your whole life my whole life it might be it's under our possession but it actually belongs to the lord it's God's grace that every one of us no matter if it's a Believer or it's an atheist they owe it to God because God has allowed us to get up in our right mind and even to breathe the air that he himself has provided it's Grace my my my my my notice the Regeneration so it's now coming where God moves down on the inside to that that seed that part of him that was in there the whole time that part that belonged to him God moves down to that part on the inside to raise up that life and bring that dwelling place that he might dwell in that that brings about a change in our lives probably every one of us here have a cell phone right and and if you've ever had to I had to one time sometime before on my previous phone I had to actually install the SIM card that was that was a miracle in itself that I got that installed when you look at the size of my fingers and I remember having to read little numbers on there to the guys in the network that I'm a part of now I had I had a nice phone of course it was an iPhone I had a nice phone you know and and all these features that was on it my nice phone it looked you know man it looked just like the other iPhone I had and traded in man everything just looked just right but you know one thing was missing that SIM card I don't care how nice the phone looked without the SIM card in it there could be no activation are you hearing me this is why when Jesus could say my sheep know my voice amen not becoming sheep but we always were sheep is that right the Bible said in the Book of Matthew and the Book of Mark that the son of man is come to seek and save that which was lost God was not lost we were lost if you ever lost your keys it's your keys even when they're lost but it was your keys before they were lost we were always Sons and Daughters of God that's why God took job in Job chapter 42 and said where was you when I laid the foundations of the world and the sons of God shouted for Joy I'm telling you they're shouting for Joy over there in God's mind where Revelations 138 said the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world it was not just because of the atmosphere but it was actually seeing the Salvation that would come when de God himself would step down and would Tabernacle himself in flesh to redeem you and I back to himself so let me just say it this right here this is a drama that's being unfolded this is not something that's currently being written and edited that's why God don't need schools of denominations he don't need the Theology of man he's never the Bible said lean not to thine own understanding is is that right that's the word of God lean upon the word of God because heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail amen amen amen so notice with this here cleansing bath of the new birth the Regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit I want to just say it to you like this that this in itself the new birth and the renewing of Our Lives is a complete work of the Holy Spirit from start to finish sir there is a renewing once once that birth has taken place on the inside there now comes a renewing and you know what it's not the renewing of psychology amen are you hearing me it's a renewing of the holy spirit so it comes back to what I was saying before once that Miracle of regeneration has taken place you now are a miracle and it's the beginning of mirac mirales in your life let me tell you something the things that God has made a way for you and I to walk through I I I'm not taking away from the Red Sea but let me just tell you that was only a type the Red Sea spoke of the power of the blood of Jesus Christ it spoke of the power that would come through Redemption and when they got to the other side they had joy in completeness is that right it would only speak of that it was only a type of the antitype that you and I have been called to experience to where we can look back on the other side and see the task Masters that once ruled over us the things that we were once subjected to and we tried to escape the things that even wanted to bring us down and and tried to you know en enslave us but there was one who came by our way and leted us to Victory in Jesus it's a renewing of our lives and you know what that renewing is still going on right here this morning there's things that the Holy Spirit you know what God God God goes into places let me just say this I listen everything that helps I say just like brother R said the things that God provides that helps humanity is of God and yet I also realize that you know what there's places where a psychologist or other people they could try to go but you know what there's times where things have become so buried in the subconscious of man it is so deep there to where even the person themselves they have come come into that place to where it's not even in their mind any longer yet it is a hindrance in their life I'll tell you there's only one that can uncover it there's only one that can deal with it there's one that can actually takes the power out of that torment that could be there in the spirit right there in the heart that maybe has still been ruling and hindering that life and wanting to haunt them but now from the inside God threw him by a positive experience by a miracle that can never ever be reversed God will work work through that to produce and overtake every area in our life that's what I want don't you Hallelujah we are his workmanship now watch this you know because everything about us then has become a miracle brother BR says it like this his nature is a miracle his habits a miracle his whole being is a miracle how can you be anything else but a miracle your new birth is a miracle your new life is a miracle even your nature is a miracle how can you look how you can look back and say them things are dead this is right you're a new creature a new creation oh my brother RA in prayer our heavenly father we are so grateful to you that we can be privileged to address you as our father for father means that we have been begotten of the great God that created the heavens and earth and we are so happy for this privilege that we can think in our hearts then that we are Sons and Daughters of God now watch this and to see you strictly identify yourself in the midst of us that you are our father so he he's identifying himself in our midst not just here not just in our midst but he's identifying himself in our midst he's in the midst of our life that's where he's dwelling when the New Birth has come he's not out here on the flesh he's not out there on the spirit but he's come to dwell in his Tabernacle and his Tabernacle he has provided for himself that place that he would dwell that seed that portion of himself that was deposited in your life that was part of your representation before the foundation of the world notice what are you what to he doing changing our thoughts from the things of the world and I don't mind telling you this is not something I don't know what happened here it's not something that just all of a sudden happens one day at the altar the change takes place in our soul that's true but then this right here changing our thoughts from things of the world some things God works on our life because we have certain Ambitions we have certain desires maybe there's even been certain upbringings certain things that we have been taught and schooled and so drilled within us that this is priority this is priority I mean may maybe let's say you know for example maybe it's you know a group of of parents that maybe they were raised up and maybe you know it was something maybe they didn't have college education then again maybe they did and here all of a sudden there everything to them it's it's education it's education it's education well sure God don't want us to be a bunch of dummies that's right but you know what never did God ever provide or put us that we would have to seek for something above him but he's our provider the scriptural principle is seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you now that might seem like a simple principle to you but you know what for somebody else that will absolutely take not only the regenerative power of the Holy Ghost that brings a new birth but it will absolutely take the renewing of the holy spirit that will actually have to work on that conscience to where that conscience in the spirit realm has been trained to where they feel as though if I don't do it this way I'm a failure come on Friends there's sometimes you know how it is it's just like when brother Ram talked about the Pentecostals he said they took the genuine articles of God and made a tradition out of them they felt like if everybody want dancing running speaking in tongues they hadn't had service or people W run into the altar we believe in all those things but we do not have to have that in order to have church that's just something that happens as sovereignly as God would give it you see that's part sometimes of the maturing in our life you say what where is that that's a renewing of the holy spirit in our life because you know what God don't want us walking around with our heads down that's right he wants us to walk as Sons and Daughters of God not arrogantly but to know who we are and you know what he comes to deal with those things in our lives just as we have need of them so I'll tell you this is one thing that has a body how we can actually pray for one another when you see one you see somebody else that has shortcomings I want you to remember look in the mirror you've got shortcomings too so the one thing that you ought to be able to do with the grace of God in your heart is to pray for somebody else is that right just like the prophet of God would say in certain places of things that he learned in that time he said sometimes he said used to be years ago he said we would a lot to it when somebody wasn't healed when we were praying for him and we would just say oh they didn't have enough Faith he said and then you come to find out it's sometimes unconfessed sin it's kind of like having electricity right here but you know if the electric cord has a short in it don't matter how much electricity is here no matter how much is down here on the inside the heart has to stay in a place to where the electricity can flow and this is where the renewing power of the Holy Spirit comes in this is why God help us to be real Priests of God help us to help us to sacrifice our own opinions about people help us to sacrifice self-righteous judgment help us Lord God to sacrifice because that is also part of our growing do you realize when God allows you to see wrong or to see shortcomings that is a test to see have we matured in our lives or are we just going to look down on somebody else I'm talking about maturing friends the real revelation of the word does not make us big AirHeads where we are puffed up and everybody else is minial Minions that is not what the revelation of Jesus Christ does I'm telling you right now if you're frustrated get in the presence of God and say God wash out all this frustration out of my life Lord I want to be a Channel of divine refreshment when others come into my presence they can say that's the odor of a Believer woo man that's refreshing that's my desire but God God places Us in that so we would pray for one another how many going to say Lord I'm going to pray a little bit more earnestly now cuz what what you need renewing on may not be what somebody else needs renewing on right all right let's let me go on here yeah changing our motives and objectives and attitudes and every phase of us to love you to believe you and know that your promises are true we grow to the full stature I want to read this scripture to you I'm going to try to deal with it just a little bit here in Romans 8 my goodness I wish I could just just preach a straight Roman Romans 8 that's actually what I'm preaching right now but out of Romans 8 notice the Bible said likewise the spirit helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought anybody ever been there as a matter of fact it's thing places we dwell often Lord I I don't even know how I don't even know how to express this I don't even know how to pray Lord I mean I'm praying but I don't even know I don't know what to say but Lord what we do we come into that moment Lord you know what I have need of Lord God give Lord you know what I have need Lord let my heart let everything be reconciled to you and see what it is it's giving ourselves to God then as the spirit helpeth our weaknesses oh glory be to God for he for he maketh the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God so so the spirit of God is not going to make intercession for us on something that would somehow Advance our life out of the kingdom of God that he won't do that so that's why we always say as a children of God we learn as we go on not to call everything a blessing we evaluate it a blessing to who a blessing to this guy or a blessing to this guy big difference this guy can be blessed and and this guy gets cold weak right not not living an overcoming life like he ought to be and that guy on the inside let me tell you you you were not made you and I were not made to thrive as far as within just that of the natural we were made to thrive in the spiritual and then the natural takes care of itself is that right that's a scriptural principle I was talking about there and we know now listen if you're if you're in that place today and say Lord man I you know my brother Samuel and fear wants to GP us you know what this is a place to even begin this is where when the scripture the the quote I read to you Sanctified consecrated life any time you find where God's dealing with your life on something and there's something whether it's said or it's something that the Holy Spirit brings to your attention while the word is being spoken that's what the spirit of truth will do he'll bring things back to our remembrance is that right as the moment as that comes our way right there while you're setting while the word's coming say yes Lord be it unto me and you know what it'll do it'll push back that fear it'll push back that doubt you know what it is it's receiving the renewing of the holy spirit in our life don't set on the word but yield to the word give ourselves to the word as God would deal with our life oh my that's consecrating our lives to the Lord isn't it amazing how you get right into service and all of a sudden the devil bring something to your mind oh Lord did I close a dog cage at home one wonder if I left the curling iron on man I wonder if I unplugged the haird dryer you know I didn't use that this morning I I wonder if I unplugged a toaster I wonder if I did this I want isin't it amazing trying to divert our attention so if he can't hinder it as far as to try to build up fear and build things up he'll try to divert our attention in another way because he knows the power listen to me now he knows the power of when a Believer comes in contact with the word and the word is received there is transforming power in the word of God is that right there is power in the word just like in Genesis 1 to transform conditions and situations so notice here as he goes on to say he maketh intercession according to the will of God the Bible goes on to say we know that all things work together for good to them that love God he never said everything's good right I mean you know my wife just made some cookies and things like that for the holiday and and I I love white chocolate oh man I love white chocolate and I like them I could eat that I could just sit there and eat them things but when but you know when she goes to making them cookies I don't grab you know a cup of flour and say boy this is good I don't grab just a cup of sugar and say man this is good I don't grab you know a teaspoon of baking soda or whatever she uses but you see when you get it all together then there's something good and there's a lot of experiences in our life that are not good but when when we yield to the Lord God brings good out of it it was a terrible situation that happened to Joseph come on somebody it was a terrible situation that happened to Daniel being took to Babylon Joseph being taken down there to Egypt they could have played the victim card are you hearing me they could have fellen under I'm a victim I'm a victim of circumstance that's true but they chose in the midst of that time and God's grace let me tell you it was not their works it was the grace of God that was there to assist them so that bitterness and everything did not permeate their lives and hinder God's program that's the same way it is in our lives friends if not for the grace of God if not for God's grace in our life for not only pointing things out in our life but if it's not for his grace coming in and moving with such such such Glory of his raise to override our own will I'm glad about that aren't you notice to be conformed for whom he did for whom he did for know Forno he he knew us he knew us before the foundation of the world is that right Bible said our names were wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he also did predestiny you knows our destiny our destiny I come from God I'm going back to to God to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren more of whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified and I love how the prophet would took that up in 62 jovah Gyra he said we're already a finished product we're just working our way out to it in the message you must be born again again the prophet goes on to say born Christians grow into the stature of Christ as they live these this is two important things grow into the stature of Christ as they live they're born again and their lives begin to shape like a baby it takes form and begins to grow and the first thing you know here they are in full stature there you are watch this day after day year after year they stay the same now he's not talking about never growing he's talking about where we are abiding in Christ that's so good many come we come back to the word if you abide in me notice we don't want to be wonders this is what the word comes to do Ephesians 4 said that we be not children tossed to and fro you see there's a lot of voices friends there's a lot of voices in the world today now you you've you've never heard it from me I I don't I don't stand here and say you can't listen to this one I I've heard a lot of times I've heard a lot of things token taken with certain quotes and things like that but I'm just going to tell you in this manner right here if you look to this as your home Church God's got this this Avenue is what is feeding you it's the Avenue that God himself not me not me not me not me there's no way that I can know the parts about your life but it's like you know when you go into a doctor's office and you go for an appointment what do they do when you go back to the room when you come in they've already got your chart pulled is that right is that right everybody with me now they got your chart pulled let me tell you something God has our chart pulled yes and when God pulls down that chart it has all the history about our lives it has everything about our life and let me just tell you something even if I did know all the history of your life I cannot fix you but God himself it isn't God interested in fixing you you are a new creation he brings a trans transformation on the inside and then from there healing Works its way out in our lives so it's him in his designated place that has our chart that's right now doesn't say that we do not receive benefit and help from specialist I've been to specialist myself things on my back and other things like that but those are not my primary doctor but they are specialized in certain things I'm glad God's got specialist don't you I'm glad that God can bring Specialists right into the church maybe it's another Pastor evangelist teacher God can bring those specialists in and God will hone right down maybe through a perspective and an angle that they're working with but it's all for the perfecting of the saints that perfecting is that complete maturity and growth into Christ that's right I tell you when we it's all said and done we stand over there Our Lives it's all Christ every little bit and every piece that we've received but thanks be to God for his grace that's been able to help us to recognize his voice and be able to receive that word as it's coming no matter the vessel he's using that's part of maturity as well too oh my notice but be born again but be born of the spirit and grow into the stature of Christ you said you see brother Dal growing into the stature of Christ through your life proves like if you were born a prophet you'll remain that if you were born a Christian you'll remain that if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will this grows you up into the stature of Christ now notice he goes into his own personal experience not some young lawyer beating screaming crying telling you this that and the other and making a lot of emotions but somebody who's grown into the stature of Christ through the years has seasoned out and proved standing at the helm did you catch those words that are all capitalized right there that is not something that happens overnight but it is as we submit ourself to God and there's a seasoning out there's a proving out standing over the helm over the years this is why oh my you know I think when I was over there even Australia and I had had the privilege of ministering that youth meeting with brother Freddy Esau there he's over in New Zealand now but brother Freddy 80 some years old my Lord I said I hope I'm I hope if God carries I hope I can get around like you do man I me you stand on CH stand on chairs and everything and preach like a house on fire and I'll tell you what but you know within it there was such a love for God such a wisdom and and such experiences that he' come through and you know he shared many experiences even about his own life of things catastrophes would come that literally you know just seemed like took him off of his rocker but it could not separate him from the love of God even to where when his wife received cancer he looked to God and said Lord I have stood and preached your word I've opened churches right there in the heart of where the city he was at in South Africa gangs and everything else around and yet you let my wife come down with cancer but he said you know what God knows how to deal with your life and soften you down that's right come on now to me you know what I can appreciate about that maturity helps us to be honest too because before that time we want to listen it's human nature to want to hide everything and I'm not saying you go go around and tell everything you got to be you have to understand you you shouldn't walk around and you got to tell your whole life like a book to everybody that isn't what I'm saying at all but I'm saying sometimes God will allow experiences to be expressed to you and I in order to be stepping stones of God's grace for you and I to walk on it's also those testimonies can come where when Satan has had you backed into the corner and you thought man I questioned God maybe I blasphemed maybe I did this maybe I done that and the spirit of God will come right through a testimony through an experience like that and it will Rel loose Satan's hold from standing over you and torment you don't you love how God works notice this but you see it's seasoned out over the years now you know it grows us all the way brother Bram goes on to say no other on Christ the solid rock we stand all other grounds is seeking Sands let denominations Creeds come let let isms keep me humble Lord stay right with the word and move right on through the stream she'll guide us to the shore full statur man friends we're living in an hour where it's time where the Earth is groaning for the manifestations of the sons of God not a big movement not a camp meeting somewhere no thank God for every Camp Meeting thank God we need meetings but the manifestations of the sons of God is Not only on a platform not only at a meeting but it's just like what took place in the prophet's home when his wife was all tore up it was a Son of God taking Dominion in that situation it's coming back to that place because it's time it's time for Rapture it's time the Millennium is not going to be a time of growing and preparing right here Rapture is where we take our character that's been molded and shaped and that's what we take with us am is that right that's what we take with us there to the other side now notice it becomes seasoned out how many of you know you know sometimes when you're cooking things sometimes we have comments you know that some of my boys are made on certain things and maybe certain places I don't like really I'm not sure I don't really like going there because they don't you know don't really seem like add flavor to the food I said that's your opinion with a capital O but you see you know you have certain things and you take I give it to you and I give I give it to you and you know you're making chicken noodle soup no no no no I think it needs more of this then I give it to you oh no it's too much salt then I give it to you oh no has too much pepper I give it to you oh you know I think it needs a little bit more noodles oh then you give it to somebody else oh carrots oh that's me carrots you see that's why I'm glad that God does not entrust the seasoning of our life life to anybody else we are seasoned by the holy spirit it's God who is seasoning our life the prophet said May the salt of the holy spirit so season our life that there would be such Sweetness in our life there would be such a testimony of where others would be drawn by the sweetness and the saltiness of the spirit in our life because you know salt was a part of every sacrifice in the old Old Testament is that right showing that it's not you can't just be letter only Paul said letter kth but the spirit giveth life it's got to have the salt with it because when the salt is in the sacrifice it's the character of God's own life and when God's own life is coming through the sacrifice of the word it has an effect Upon Our Life to change our lives that our character might match his character don't you love him yes yes sir let me just try to jump head here real quick this is why that even when we look at in our lives this is why Paul when we think of it the holy spirit being the tutor how many of you recognize the scripture where where Paul would talk about yay though doubtless I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ I want to read that scripture to you out of the Amplified version Paul said yay I count everything as loss compared to the possession of the Priceless privilege the overwhelming preciousness the surpassing worth and supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord and of progressively becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with him of perceiving and recognizing and understanding him more fully and clearly for his sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish in order that I may win Christ the anointed one I want to be more like him this is what Paul is speaking in that verse I I I want to become more I want to become more deeply intimately I want to know him more and realize the Bible tells us it's the fellowship of his sufferings I love the part where Paul would say that I may know him in the power of his resurrection you could say Paul don't you already know him in the power of his resurrection Paul could say I do but many times in my life when the negative is all around me negative thoughts negative circumstances there are things where the ship are being tossed up and down and it seems like it's going under but at that time the power of the Resurrection works from the inside out to lift me to change the thoughts break back the clouds he was there the whole time but the power of the Resurrection comes forth from within our lives but there's Fellowship that comes through the midst of suffering in the valley that the mountaintops will never produce you see this is where that even in our lives sometimes even we start out young Christians and it can actually it can go on sometimes you find people that's been serving the lord for a long time and they search for mountaintops they'll go from Mountaintop experience to Mountaintop experience to Mountaintop experience to Mountaintop experience you know why human nature does not like valleys they'll search for this move search for this move wherever it's happening seems like it's but you know what you never produce fruit on mountains it's too cold up there you produce food fruit in the valley that's Psalms 1 I I just want to be where he's at like like what like what Moses told him Lord if you don't go I ain't going I'm going where your presence is because that's where there's peace that's where there's joy and there's fruit that's got to be brought out of my life is that right you see this is it's just like when we were growing up remember when we were you know I know every one of us are different I mean you know there's probably like maybe out of this whole congregation maybe three people that wasn't followers when they were in school and no doubt some think they weren't when they were and you know maybe they didn't have the certain couldn't obtain the certain brands or fit in with certain clicks or get in with certain things but it was always that desire why it's always a desire to fit in always want to be accepted right and there's certain things about it you know where we're we're trying this and then and then this becomes a new style this is the new style leave this leg down roll this one up to your knee uh and then then you know this this becomes the new style you know to wear to wear your pants like this or wear your shirt like this or do this or do that and it's always you know trying to fit in always trying to to come into that place and it's always and within it you always find emptiness you don't find that all of a sudden you gain more friends as soon as the next thing changes from one style to the next here you are live you are left in a place either get a job pick up more hours or hope mom and dad got a good income tax return that will actually help you to be able to attain certain things so you can keep in with everybody else that's a trap and that can be a trap in our spiritual walk with God I'm not interested in keeping up with everybody else thank God for what God's doing at so and so's church and whatever more but God you know what every Church goes through seasons is that right every Church goes through Seasons sometimes there's seasons of dryness there's seasons of sewing God will do those certain things the prophet tells us to test us to see what we will do but you know one thing I'm so glad about it God ain't going to lose one that's right God ain't going to lose one sometimes there's things that you can say I never was bothered with that glory to God I'm glad so glad maybe You' got your Sunday school star back from when you were just a wee little born again Pik you have that man that star was on the chart but that doesn't mean that everybody else had that star on the chart right away that's right you see it's an individual experience and an individual walk that's a part of a whole body so if you've got three gold stars and I've only got one guess what pray pray that he'll get the other two gold stars right is that all right that that's that's what we're here for so notice we we come through it's it's wisdom through experience remember brother R would would take this in example in the message humble thyself and he would talk about you know how that any person's time on Earth as your allotted time on Earth you know it' be most foolish if we don't serve God but you know he he was asking the question what what time would we take if we were given a choice by God in serving him which one of these allotments would we take you know birth to 25 if we're going to do that brother Ram said if you're going to be a heartbreak for the women maybe you take that one because CU after 25 it's all downhill then 25 to 50 you want to be a teacher mechanic and one of occupation you you this is what I want to be this is my ambition You' take that one but you know brother BR said if I had my choice I would choose 50 to 75 and then he goes on to say actually says if God would allow me Grace to be here when I'm 100 I would be better prepared now when I would be 100 to get into the foreign field now now listen listen don't don't don't don't don't look around at people that are close to 100 just stay with me now all right now I want you I want you to notice listen what he's saying it's a spiritual application here he says what it is he said I would take that 75 to 100 I'd be smarter and wiser I'd be more settled I'd know more about what I'm doing I wouldn't jump in like I'm killing snakes I'd know more about it he's talking about in his ministry he said it's just like a dog fighting a you know more about how to take a hold of him you don't jump in there and scratch you up you know his tricks in what he does and we learn more about the enemy so we've got to find out all his techniques how he approaches what he does learn his punches then you're trained to go in on him BR said I believe I'd be in better shape now than I was when I was 40 years old when I'm 100 I'll be even better if God would T and I'd tar I'd be in better shape because you know more about it you know more about what to do and how to handle it and how to handle the situation how many times there's times you know probably every one of us have heard this I tell you what man when we have children they're not going to do this and this and this and this I've been there I've already seen that usually you I'm almost the SP anymore I want to say don't say nothing don't don't don't because I've seen them do the exact opposite of what they said not going to do this not going to do that boy I tell you what we got children it'll never be like this and it'll never be like this and then you know here we come you know as new parents why do we you know we look at things why do we you know read you know Parenting Magazine I don't know if that's what it's called or whatever more you know uh you know maybe WR wrote by females that never even had children at all you know and yet they know all about it you know and then you got all these kinds of things like the prophet said it talk sounds like when they tell you to let that little child lay there in the crib and cry cry it off he said it don't sound like a very professional say that it sounds like a witch doctor because that very thing he said will produce neurotics gangsters you say how could that be why where what produces a gangster he never had a family that accepted him where he could fit in why do you think gangs and all those other things are rising why do you think they come from oh brother Samuel there's evil around that's true but do you realize friends the reason that those things are can be so exploited is because there is bruises so deep in people that have never had father figures never had families and it opens them up they want to have a family somebody that would have my back somebody that actually wants to look at my face and wants me to be around them and you wonder how those types of things happen oh it's just a bad country over there Venezuela and this and that it's just listen it comes down from situations like that I wonder how many situations that the Holy Spirit if he can comb through here in these services and find that there's places in our hearts that he himself could bring healing in our lives and watch our lives as a Christian grow from that area let me just tell you something it may not be where something right now that you even noticed or you even see or aware of but God knows exactly where you and I are at and let me just tell you something you ought to just let it be known right now if there's something that stands before you if there's something that comes out with bitterness of this or that or one more listen this is what you ought to do don't don't don't don't look around at somebody else but invite Lord invite the Lord say father Mel away this bitterness because the only person that's going to kill is you bitterness is like you taking this and you drinking it and I'm waiting for him to fall over it won't work guess who gets affected right me and not only me but my whole family then eventually the church because bitterness will spread you can't contain bitterness you don't lock it up but a room you can't just say well it's here in this compartment it'll spread but oh I say Lord let the renewing rise of the holy spirit let it spread in our lives as you can let the Holy Spirit take out all malice bitterness disappointment hurt but we grow how many say Lord I want to grow I want to grow Lord I want to continue to grow let me just try to let me let me wrap it up right here because I'm not gonna I'm not g to push on I wanted to get into Joshua but I'm just going to stop right here brother Bram takes this takes this up here in the message and he says in works as Faith Express he's talking about when he first started out I don't want you to read it ahead of me he when he first started out he said he would come out of those out of those healing meetings discernment had taken place and he said I was walking on the street didn't even know where I was at he said I was like a little boy that had been trying to swim I didn't know how to make The Strokes at that time now watch how he'll applied this in works as Faith Express he says you know he says it's like you're learning to swim you splash the water you go across the pool and I made her now after you learn to swim see there's a difference between learning and you've learned yeah right or as they say in the South it learned you real good after you learn to swim how do you learn to swim there's some mistakes in it that that that are made right there's some times where here you are in the middle of swimming and you realize I got to get to the side of the pool right you might you you stand come on now don't get quiet on me I mean maybe you know you usually you had maybe an inner tube kind of close together you had an instructor and somebody who was there coaching you along the way true and before you could maybe swim the entire length of the pool you might say I started out right away I swam the entire length of the pool the first time okay so maybe you swam it the first time but now swim turn around and swim it on the way back oh brother Samuel I eventually got to there that's how in our Christian walk there's a growing that's taking place but notice the swimming he says after you learn to swim it's more graceful in the stroke it don't wear you out as much you learn how to do it and cut every corner and make it better that's more of an ease he says you take like a little boy that never walked would try to walk down this aisle here he would fall down a dozen times and be wore out before he got here but anyone who knows how to walk like an athlete would walk right down that aisle and never even notice doing it he had to start with that coming down the aisle that's what he is now though brother Bram said that's the same way with preaching Divine Healing or anything else as you go along you begin to learn I don't mind to tell you I've learned as a pastor and I'm still learning I've learned as a husband and I'm still learning you know kind of like one of the the funny things we were kind of you know talking about you know the other night and just sitting around talking and you know sometimes understand in case you didn't notice that I got three boys so working with them to understand to help them to understand that when when we talk about understanding your wife or understanding her that doesn't mean that you're going to understand it it means that you understand how to work with it yeah that's right it was a funny little video that somebody showed us where they she had a nail sticking out of her head and she's on the couch with her husband and he's looking at you need to get that nail out of your forehead and she's just talking about you know that you know things going on when I go to put a sweater on it snags and he's just saying as a male would the Nail's the problem she don't want the nail out the forehead just listen to her yeah yeah just Pat her on the hand that's right tell her you understand come on friends I'm not making fun I'm just saying this is real things yes it is there are times to solve problems but you learn don't you Lord I would hope I have more hands up as husbands in here you learn some of you probably want to raise your feet as well but what what he did that experiences of saying the wrong things right you go and then you thought man I should have been the hero I went out to get the Hammer with the claw and get it out but you realize that's not what she wanted you might say that's confusing but you understand you understand you understand see how what happens to that it's growing now you and you could stand as a husband and say that don't make sense okay I mean we can talk about that later me and you but you could say that don't make sense well there's a lot of things about us that don't make sense to her oh yeah like how that men love nothing time what are you doing nothing and it is wonderful wonderful decompression nothing time what do you think thinking about nothing but you see how do you understand that oh I know when I when I got before I got married I thought I knew everything oh man you know I thought I knew my wife knew man I thought this and that but oh boy I realized that you know what knowing is it's dying yes it is it's dying that's good preaching it's learning and you know the the only way that we can actually come that way with God it starts through a death and a new birth and then All Things become new there's a lot of things that God will do and say places he'll take us through that doesn't make sense that's right there's things that he will do that we can think like Paul Lord if you'll just remove this Thorn from my life Lord remove this but God could say Paul my grace is sufficient because in weakness perfect weakness my strength is perfect do we understand that no we do not understand that humanly speaking because we look at when we're the strongest is when we feel like we're right there on the mountain that's when I'm at my best and actually that's when we're at the most vulnerable moments in our life that's right and God brings us and lets us come down in the valley of a place of surrender because that's where fruit is born you don't have Rivers up there on the top of the mountain but the Bible said that a man blessed is the man where his Delight is in the Lord he's planted by the rivers of Living Water so there's understanding that comes our way as we grow like the prophet's talking about right here we understand a little bit more there's things think about it after we've passed through certain things when brother R would talked to sister mey about 18-year-old thoughts here she was didn't sister mey live live through 18 years old she did didn't brother Bram he did it's just like as you come through things with your children but sometimes we can try to see things through our time and the challenge is can we think those thoughts to remember what it was like now when we remember what it's like it's not compromising but it's to think and enter in there but say God give me the wisdom to lead them in this moment in their life because you see when you begin to think that way then you're stepping in as an intercessor on their behalf Lord help them during this time instead of looking at them like they're a nutcase what's going on why do they think this way why is this going on but see when you can begin to come into that place Lord I remember when I was 16 I remember when I was 18 Lord I remember when I was 21 or let's bring it to a church body Lord I can remember when I first got saved Lord I can remember how it was such a blessing others took me under their wing and helped me out they encouraged me they strengthened me they invited me for Fellowship Lord God thank you for those many of them may maybe gone on to the other side but now what are we doing in return for that what are we doing Lord help me that I can be a blessing too because then we can really pray for one another don't you love him to me it's to me friends it's just tremendous how God Works through the body it it's absolutely tremendous it's something that to under to just our minds cannot even fathom it but to know that God is working right on time and this important statement let me just close here if you don't learn there's something wrong see experiences doesn't necessarily mean we learn that's right if we continue to do the same things over and over again and expect a different outcome it's what Insanity that's the definition of it so just just just going through experiences does not mean we're learning but when we're submitting to him even when we fall in short even when it comes like I was using that illustration between husband and wife even as we come into those places to say Lord help me how to minister to my husband help me how to minister to my wife help me Lord how to minister to my children help me to know how to minister to the rest of the body don't you love him I want to learn because with that right there if you've got to learn you've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means CU if we're not if we're not learning we're not growing right that's that's exactly what the prophet is saying we're not growing so one one of the things about growing is where we're learning our understanding to trust him even our understanding of our own self to understand your own shortcomings come on Friends some people need a little bit more sleep than other people some need less some need and you know what you might think that's such a natural thing H Let It Be where somebody doesn't receive what they need and it can be a great hindrance to their life right they think man I'm going going to go on a diet and I'm going to fast and they end up about eating everybody for lunch before lunch you might say that's pretty natural but it's trying listen it's understanding different parts in our lives this is why brother BR would work with so many different ones he said when I get overworked that's when Satan pours it on me I say Lord help us friends I say it right here this morning the same spirit of God he's here to bring transformation in our lives he's here this morning if you've never experienced that real miracle in your life yield to him let it say God help me Lord override all of my thoughts all of my fears all of my doubts Lord I commit myself to you brother the Samuel I've tried it but remember to try it is different than surrendering to it you can try something like there's sometimes there's lots of food I've tried and I didn't eat it I tried it but I didn't eat it but if you'll surrender and say Lord condition My Heart Lord condition my life I I I want Lord with everything within me I want to be a walking miracle that Miracle of where that change in my life that was spoken about where that growth will come forth and others Lord I want that renewing of the holy spirit that growth from the positive on the inside not this man the negative trying to work and trying to produce but let me yield to you Lord with a consecrated Sanctified life help me Lord I want to know you more I want to know what pleases you wouldn't you want to know listen to me just a few moments here wouldn't you want to know think about it think about how it is I know sometimes we're we're just barely able to get in the door here I get it I get it I know sometimes even on midweek services and other things I know that but H think about what it's been at times when we've been able to have some time to prepare before we come to the house of God even sometimes it may even be the FIV minute drive on the way here sometimes you may that praying might seem like the farthest thing that your flesh wants to do yet you know Lord that's that's what I I need to do I need to I need to get before you and here you are maybe events have happened maybe you got something in the mail you didn't open yesterday but you opened it on Sunday morning breakfast table and it just ruined your appetite it actually has ruined almost seemed like it overshadowed any expectation you would have from the things of the Lord and just a weariness just a Gloom just an oppressiveness that would seem to set down but yet how the spirit of God could move right down here in the midst of this moment and give us a real refreshing to break back those clouds to break that back and say God just a fresh Lord renewing from your presence just a strengthening Lord in my life you know it all it all is a consecrating you know what it is is that right how how many knows what it is when you go I know it's very simple things I'm not trying to keep it but I'm just trying let it be applied to our our Natural Life anybody like getting out of getting up late and trying to make it to work anybody ever had that happen I remember one time when I still worked in sanduski we were actually living over there I just started pastoring and I remember the one time I had to actually take some things from my back the one time and it was not even one of those knockout pills but all of a sudden I got a phone call and the phone call received was my my principal she said are you coming in today man I mean I already and listen this was already late and and and I thought oh no I mean you you you just you look at it you're like man the whole day what's the day going to hold I mean you know you're just trying to get ready trying to get down the road you're wondering what are the kids going to be like when I get in there are you hearing me now and you just feel like everything's going to be going to be a ruin and you know how that feels where there's times where there's pressure situations that just comes and says man if I could just call off I would call off but yet there's such a difference when we can actually be able to get up maybe only hit the snooze button one time get out of bed coffee's already on extra shot in there you're ready to go man it feels good to get there early that's the same way sometimes we learn these simple little things in our walk with god of just even when we enter in coming into the sanctuary getting ready to receive from God we start even on Saturday night entering in it's not that we're bad people then all of a sudden we change gears but we begin to realize we're approaching the Throne of God and you know what we learn we learn as we go on because you can see the benefit of what you get out of the the service you can see the investment that takes place don't you love him let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer musicians why don't you go and come Heavenly Father Lord through the foolishness of preaching you chose to save Souls Lord father it would not be that of a man would not be that of just words but Lord God it's your strength it's you coming through your word and just melding away Lord father all of our fears all of our doubts Lord God the things that Lord that might even be there Lord in the heart that Lord where Satan has wanted to pres Lord keep that as a hindrance is Lord for something not a life not move moving on with you Lord would you just go down in every area of Our Lives Lord every one of us that are gathered here maybe just as every eyes closed maybe just as a token to him with just a hand or hands uplifted say Lord every eye closed Lord just go down in every area Lord Lord God I want to be consecrated I I want to be one with you and through that Oneness Lord of your life on the inside I I want Lord God I I want to know you more Lord like a husband and a wife would get to know one another and then you know Lord each of their children Lord each of my each of my boys there similarities but there's such differences there's certain ways that I can approach one that I won't approach the other one that way but you've helped me to see that Lord and that's how you do us Lord as your children you said in your word you know your sheep by name by character you know us you know just how to approach us it'll always be a word approach it's always you but you know just how to deal with each one of our Lives Lord May the Holy Spirit Lord may you comb through our lives may we lord be so seasoned by the spirit of God lord if there's one here in under the sound of my voice this morning that's never experienced that miracle in their life to where they can look back and see my life is different it's not something that that I've tried or maken myself but I see the difference in my life I see and I know by that inward desire in my life I'm not what I used to [Music] be Lord may they just consecrate themselves to you right now may they just Lord God in your presence in the sweetness and Stillness of the Holy Spirit oh God just say Lord melt away my will Lord I want to I want to be one with you [Music] Lord granted Lord I pray may you just continue Lord to move Lord in our lives help us Lord I want to please you Lord Jesus there's things sometimes Lord that I think about Lord after times that my wife and I Lord is when we were married there's certain things that after some periods of time or we could talk certain things we could actually begin to express certain things to not in a manner of criticizing one another but in Lord in a manner Lord to be able to express maybe certain things that were done or said or or not done and how that would cause us to feel and Lord God we be able to Lord be able to talk about those things I to me Lord that in itself was such a victory Even in our marriage Lord how much greater Lord in that spiritual union with you that we can come and we can talk it over with you Lord there's nothing there's many things there's tress there's trials that we've we've come to Lord but father Your Grace has been sufficient there's a lot of things that we don't understand I than Lord right in this assembly there's been sometimes there's been tragedy that's struck we don't understand it but we trust you We Trust You Lord we trust you we trust you father Lord God the disciples didn't understand what had taken place when they were walking on the road to emus they did not understand it did not go according to what they thought and how it should be but it went right according to the word of God and where they were veiled in their minds you who rent the veil in two Oh Glory you rem you God you removed that veil in their mind as you were walking with them their hearts begin to burn they begin to burn the Bible tells us Lord that their eyes were withholden that they wouldn't know you and I hear your Prophet say that there was a little something about them that they were wondering is this him but they didn't have a certainty is this him but once he came in behind closed doors you unveiled yourself you took the bread and you broke it in the same way and they knew this is the same one this is him this is him that we walk the shores of Galilee with he is indeed risen and has fulfilled every promise that was spoken of the Messi mesiah Our Redeemer oh God right here this morning Lord as the Holy Spirit would begin to move Lord and father begin to brood and Lord our hearts would begin to just burn Lord God within us may you Lord I pray we invite you Lord God we invite you Lord Jesus move Lord into every area of our life Lord God remove every Veil Lord God I pray father that Lord Jesus our lives not only Lord being regenerated through the new birth but Lord that renewing in our lives help us Lord I pray may you go may you do what Only You Can Do Lord minister to every hurt minister to every bruise Lord every wound granted Lord oh Lord granted I pray father Hallelujah in the name of Jesus Christ Grant it Lord amen oh my could we just could we just worship him just a little bit you know that's also another part that we learn even as Believers we learn the day and age we're living in sometimes the day that we're living in I I know we have things to do I know there's other things and I'm not trying to hold you here friends but sometimes the things that we're in such a time where we can get into such a place and I've heard it said over the years the word the word the word the word the word the word but you know you got to water the word you got to let the Holy Spirit water the word brother Ram would tell the people it's a time to let the spirit of God come in and water that word let him water it into our lives let him water it in I say Lord Jesus let's just take a few moments let's take a few moments and worship him let's take a few moments in prayer even as we're worshiping say Lord just let it saturate down in my life I want to learn Lord I want to grow I want to be more like you I want the word that I'm hearing I want to see it Lord become flesh in my life I invite you in Lord you've been walking with me all service I invite you in Lord hallelujah go ahead Hallelujah if you'd like to stand

of administration some of that's already taken place you know it'll change a lot of different things that can affect even down into the lower levels is a change from the Top This Is Why when the scripture tells us it would do no good to just try to take off an arm try to take off a foot but God himself deals a Blow To The Head of the serpent when the Holy Ghost has come it's a new Administration in our lives Hallelujah and when a new Administration moves into our lives not like that of even of the Earthly when he moves into his rightful position he makes us Kings and Priests we are now under the Dominion in the Kingdom of his dear son and under that Administration not everything changes all at once right but what changes is the desires and then eventually the way that things are done in that Kingdom begins to Hallelujah take place in our lives we begin to realize that though I am a Browning in the natural but I'm a Son of God so I'm not here to conduct or put myself up as a Browning because Browning is just like any any other piece of dirt that's upon the face of the Earth it's what's on the inside there's not no matter what your last name is no matter where you come from I don't you could have come what you would think from the best stock in the world it don't matter we still need the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost we're nothing and when the Holy Ghost comes in he helps us to see we're nothing and we're still nothing and it's him but oh in that change of administration that's when there's things that starts getting past things that starts changing in our lives can you see that in your own life there's changing and you know what the changing keeps on going because it's the same one in you that created the heavens and the Earth how did he create the heavens and the Earth did he do everything all at once no he worked on day [Music] one if we can say time in that way to sustain what was coming on in day two he would put day one and day two together sustained what he would bring forth in day three see God works in our lives he's building in order to sustain what further work he's doing in our lives you know what's actually happening it's God in you in me unfolding himself that's what he's doing he's unfolding himself he's unveiling himself through our lives and you know the only thing that you and I have to do is die die to our own thinking die to our own reasoning die to everything around say Lord be it unto me Lord consecrate ourselves to the word give ourselves you say how do I consecrate to the word reading praying inviting the prince of the Lord to come in and work in those areas of your life just that's that's it's just that simple you love him this morning yes amen listen friends he's still working on you he's still working on you he's still working on me I tell you what don't give up on me I'm not going to give up on you come on that ain't just a pep talku but the same thing God and His longsuffering working in your life working in my life there's things that I can look back in my own life and I look back and many times I'll tell my wife I'll say Lord have mercy I realize how long-suffering God was with me Lord have mercy how I was some years ago and this and how I would have I I wasn't I wasn't approaching something in a certain way on purpose but then God brings things to a highlight in your life and you saying dear Lord but I'm so glad that he does it I'm glad he does it don't you amen he doesn't do it to harm us to shame us he does it as we can let go of anything in our life malice bitterness on and on and on and on and on God more of the holy spirit will grow in our lives don't you love him don't you love him hallelujah amen why don't you shake hands with that brother or sister that's right standing right beside you say God bless you Pilgrim God bless you in Christian love I'm praying for you let them know I'm praying for you we're going to make it may the Holy Spirit may God go with you
