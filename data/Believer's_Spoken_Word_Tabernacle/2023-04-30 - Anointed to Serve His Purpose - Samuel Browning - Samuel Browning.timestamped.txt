[44:22] I want to go into the scriptures here in
[44:24] the first John chapter 5.
[44:28] and verse 1.
[44:37] good to see
[44:39] good to see each one of you amen see
[44:42] some faces of Heaven I know some
[44:44] sickness and things that's been among us
[44:46] but uh
[44:47] so good to see you amen it's good to be
[44:50] together
[44:52] amen
[44:54] first John chapter 5 and verse 1.
[44:59] whosoever believeth
[45:02] that Jesus is the Christ is born of God
[45:06] and everyone that loveth him that began
[45:10] loveth him also that has begotten of him
[45:15] and by this we know that we love the
[45:18] children of God
[45:20] when we love God and keep his
[45:23] Commandments
[45:25] for this is the love of God
[45:27] that we keep
[45:29] his Commandments now this word keep is
[45:32] not expressing as though as they did it
[45:36] in the Old Testament where they did it
[45:39] in order to be righteous but this is
[45:42] expressing from a heart of reverence
[45:45] that moves by a righteousness inwardly
[45:49] to keep the word of God
[45:52] reverence it to observe it to look at it
[45:55] and just to be even when Lord I don't
[45:58] know exactly the step to make your how
[46:00] to do that but I'm captured right here
[46:02] Lead Me Lord
[46:05] and the next part is a very key to what
[46:07] we just said and his Commandments are
[46:09] not Grievous
[46:12] there's not one to to a real believer
[46:14] there's not one thing that's Grievous
[46:16] there's not one word that's offensive
[46:20] is that right
[46:22] verse 4.
[46:24] for whatsoever is born of God
[46:28] overcometh
[46:30] the world
[46:32] and this is the victory
[46:34] that overcometh the world
[46:37] even our faith
[46:41] I want to read that that one more time
[46:43] for whatsoever is born of God
[46:47] overcometh the world and this is the
[46:51] victory that overcometh the world even
[46:54] our faith
[46:55] who is he that overcometh the world but
[46:58] he that believer that Jesus is the son
[47:03] of God
[47:05] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[47:07] of the word as you're being seated
[47:13] we know that
[47:15] when we look here in the scripture I'd
[47:17] like to read
[47:18] a statement that brother Branham makes
[47:20] here in the message
[47:23] why Christ speak out of 63 and he's he's
[47:26] opening in prayer
[47:28] and I'd just like to just to really draw
[47:30] our attention into this here
[47:33] when we're preparing to speak on here
[47:35] this morning
[47:36] he said we're grateful for this time
[47:38] this morning
[47:40] and open to us by the Holy Spirit the
[47:44] contents of this word
[47:47] that we shall read May the Holy Spirit
[47:50] teach us today the things that we ought
[47:53] to know
[47:54] I say Amen to that
[47:56] and may we then in return listen closely
[47:59] to every word and weigh it deeply
[48:02] and then may those who are listening by
[48:04] the way of tape may they listen close
[48:06] and may we be able to catch what the
[48:09] holy spirit is trying to reveal to us
[48:12] for we realize if he should anoint us
[48:17] then the anointing is not in vain it's
[48:21] for a purpose that we might work to the
[48:25] good to the Lord and may our hearts and
[48:28] our understanding be open Lord may we
[48:31] have freedom to speak and freedom to
[48:34] hear and access to Faith to believe what
[48:37] we have heard as it comes from God's
[48:40] word that it might count up to us
[48:43] eternal life in the great day that is to
[48:45] come and bless us today Lord condemn us
[48:48] when we're wrong let us know the faults
[48:51] that we have
[48:52] and and bless us in the way that is
[48:55] right that we might know which way to go
[48:58] and how to act in this present world
[49:01] that we might bring honor in our living
[49:05] here to Jesus Christ who died to give us
[49:08] a life in the great Hereafter and we ask
[49:12] it in Jesus name amen and I want to draw
[49:16] our attention to this statement that
[49:18] brother random has made and just
[49:20] pondering this and he says what I just
[49:23] read for we realize if he should anoint
[49:27] us then the anointing is not in vain
[49:33] so the coming of the holy spirit is not
[49:37] in vain
[49:38] how could it be in vain
[49:41] if I don't receive what he is actually
[49:44] saying
[49:46] if I don't move within it
[49:49] then it passes right through
[49:51] but there's got to be something there to
[49:54] say oh God I my natural mind it's not in
[49:57] my natural mind but oh God let my heart
[50:00] be open
[50:02] Lord give me the understanding that I
[50:05] need to see the things that I need to
[50:07] see in the light of your word so then
[50:11] anointing is not in vain it's for a
[50:15] purpose that it might work to the good
[50:17] to the Lord and I want to just speak
[50:20] here this morning on anointed to serve
[50:23] his purpose
[50:25] when you think of that word purpose the
[50:27] word purpose itself common word to us
[50:30] and all the way through the scripture we
[50:32] find it that God God's purpose God's
[50:36] Eternal purpose and that's where that we
[50:39] are called according to his purpose and
[50:42] so when we look at this in the word the
[50:45] word very word purpose is the reason for
[50:48] which something is done or created or
[50:52] for which something
[50:53] exists so it's the very reason for why
[50:57] something is done or created or for
[51:00] which something exists
[51:02] brother Branham takes this here and the
[51:04] message faith is our Victory and
[51:07] he speaks of how that he says when we
[51:10] would be brought here upon this Earth
[51:12] how that it ought to be something that
[51:15] would cause us to reflect and to
[51:17] consider and ask God what he would have
[51:21] us to do
[51:23] see it's that's something that arises I
[51:26] I just I don't have all of these quotes
[51:28] up there because some I want to read and
[51:30] some I don't want just just follow me
[51:31] here
[51:32] it's something that arises in our hearts
[51:35] that when God as it begins to move in
[51:38] our life you know sometimes there when
[51:41] our lives can work around and you're you
[51:43] can be worn looking around what is my
[51:46] purpose for being here why am I here I
[51:49] think that's a very deep question
[51:51] I think it's a question that Satan would
[51:55] love to try to fulfill and try to answer
[51:58] and every time that Satan has tried to
[52:01] take things and then twist it to his own
[52:03] good or to what his interpretation is we
[52:07] see what it leads to it leads to death
[52:09] every single time
[52:11] and that's where we're at today but you
[52:13] know to ask what is the purpose that
[52:15] that I'm here the purpose of the coming
[52:17] and what is what am I here to fulfill
[52:20] and brother Brandon says it like this he
[52:22] says we but we seem to be just wanting
[52:25] to keep up with the world and the Bible
[52:28] said we cannot we that we can overcome
[52:31] the world but how do we do it not by
[52:35] keeping up with the Fashions of the
[52:38] world but the Bible said that faith is
[52:40] the victory that overcomes the world
[52:44] that's why and that's the whole
[52:46] principle that's where even where the
[52:48] fall came in Satan begin to come and
[52:52] anoint
[52:53] God's daughter with unbelief and that
[52:57] anointing was actually taking her away
[53:00] from the purpose of God
[53:03] and that that anointing as it was coming
[53:06] because it was unbelief is an anointing
[53:09] and it was coming to it to to anoint her
[53:12] in a measure to say well you see you see
[53:15] this here and look what God is keeping
[53:18] from you and she she yields she begins
[53:21] to yield to the voice then she begins to
[53:24] yield to every touch she begins to yield
[53:27] to all of those things and that is where
[53:30] that where the world stands today is to
[53:34] try to seek after other things as a
[53:38] source of comfort
[53:39] and there is no other source of comfort
[53:43] you can choose the in pink color and
[53:45] it'll be out next month
[53:47] and don't say that to be funny I say
[53:49] that and there's nothing wrong with
[53:51] liking certain colors but I'm just going
[53:53] to say it like this that if your
[53:55] satisfaction in life is over things of
[53:59] this life
[54:01] that is Satan's track
[54:04] our purpose is not to keep up with the
[54:08] world
[54:09] we're not of the world
[54:12] I don't plan on this is not I don't plan
[54:15] on staying here everything
[54:18] right I'm not of this world I'm in the
[54:22] world but I'm not out in the world
[54:24] we're kept by the power of God so
[54:27] there's a way to overcome the world so
[54:29] when we look at this brother REM gives
[54:32] an example here and you're familiar with
[54:34] it
[54:34] and he talks about when a bum had come
[54:37] to his door
[54:39] and he said this bug came to his door
[54:41] and asked him for a sandwich and brother
[54:45] Brian said well sure step on in and
[54:48] while brother random had him there in
[54:49] the home he asked him a question where
[54:53] did you come from
[54:55] and the man just Shrugged his shoulders
[54:57] nowhere
[54:59] what then where are you going
[55:02] and he stopped eating and he looked at
[55:04] me and he said nowhere
[55:06] and he swallowed a big old bite sir this
[55:09] is what he told the brother around him
[55:11] sir just wear my hats resting that's
[55:14] where I rest
[55:17] are you seeing here there's there's no
[55:19] sense of commitment
[55:22] there's no anchor
[55:26] there's no stability
[55:29] there's no ambition
[55:33] is that right
[55:35] how long have you been doing this
[55:38] oh some 20 years or more with no
[55:42] Ambitions to better himself
[55:46] so living that living that that form of
[55:50] a life and just wandering around now
[55:53] brother Branham will then parallel this
[55:55] and he says that's the way he says it
[55:58] looks many times with the attitude of
[56:01] the people he said what we call Drifters
[56:04] or floaters
[56:06] how many know what a floating piece of
[56:08] wood looks like
[56:09] we call it Driftwood right
[56:12] so brother Rahman is going to bring that
[56:15] in comparison of the
[56:18] sins it's just you know wherever it just
[56:21] wherever his hat and rest okay that's
[56:23] where I'm at for today and where I'm at
[56:25] here and and you know and so let me just
[56:27] say this not only is the man himself
[56:30] unstable but everybody else can see his
[56:33] instability
[56:35] is that right it's just like when you go
[56:37] to show up for a job and you've got a
[56:39] resume and you've got it loaded with
[56:42] jobs that you've man you've been and out
[56:44] of jobs and changed jobs like people
[56:46] change socks right
[56:48] I'll tell you what it says it says a
[56:51] lack of stability well you don't
[56:53] understand brother Samuel this child was
[56:55] like this and this job was like this I
[56:57] know it was everybody else's fault
[57:01] who we're preaching now
[57:03] it shows instability and it brings a
[57:06] question now I'm talking in the natural
[57:07] for the employer why would I want to
[57:10] invest training time training hours why
[57:15] because the past shows that even when
[57:19] adversity comes you've not had an anchor
[57:22] that holds you through adversity
[57:24] and so when adversity comes you freedom
[57:28] to the easiest place
[57:33] so he's talking about the attitude of
[57:36] the people and I'll tell you uh when we
[57:38] look at this he says floating and
[57:41] Driftwood and he says you know Driftwood
[57:44] and we've all seen this when you go down
[57:46] you know through the Black River you go
[57:48] many times you go into streams and and
[57:50] places Driftwood or wood like that it
[57:54] just it brother says it hangs up in any
[57:57] kind of trash
[57:58] it gets hung up in trash
[58:01] and it can't go no further
[58:04] it gets caught up with things of life
[58:07] he gets caught up in Gossip
[58:10] it gets caught up in trash
[58:13] come on Friends
[58:16] notice but he says it's like that he
[58:19] said in the Stream of life
[58:22] Driftwood hanging in every trash pile
[58:26] but everybody's seen a boat right so we
[58:28] got Driftwood we got a boat
[58:31] hello everybody's seen a boat right now
[58:34] don't go daydreaming and act like you're
[58:36] out there fishing for walleye right now
[58:39] now watch
[58:40] watch I know the boats that we look at
[58:42] and is they're mainly made out of you
[58:44] correct remember wrong fiberglaster am I
[58:46] right about that fiberglass
[58:48] who knows we hope they're made out of
[58:50] fiberglass
[58:53] but if the boat as it has even when
[58:55] brother bran was talking about it there
[58:58] that the boat itself is made out of wood
[59:03] says this boat notice it's made out of
[59:07] wood too so same wood
[59:09] but it's shaped out by a master who
[59:12] builds it and not only is it shaped out
[59:15] but it's Guided by a master and it's
[59:20] pushed by a power
[59:22] so that's the difference between
[59:24] Driftwood and a boat
[59:27] Driftwood has no control it just goes
[59:32] wherever the current of Life takes it
[59:36] yeah why it has there's nothing there to
[59:40] guide it there's nothing to control it
[59:43] and when it gets hung up in trash it has
[59:47] no power to get it out
[59:51] we're all made out of the same stuff so
[59:53] this is where it comes down there are no
[59:56] natural genes here better than one
[59:58] no we're all made out of the same stuff
[1:00:02] it just depends on how your Ambitions
[1:00:05] run and are you willing to let the
[1:00:08] master Craftsman make out of you that
[1:00:12] which he could use and that which he
[1:00:15] could control and that he could power
[1:00:17] but said you take this little certain
[1:00:20] craft it's been made different it's been
[1:00:22] crafted out by the Master's Hand and
[1:00:25] should it ever stick into some weeds
[1:00:27] along in Shallow Waters there is a power
[1:00:31] behind it a little bolt that the master
[1:00:34] can turn on and push it out in to the
[1:00:37] Deep Waters again what does it say there
[1:00:39] are obstacles in life that we will need
[1:00:43] a power behind there are trials that
[1:00:46] come our way and takes a resource of
[1:00:50] power from within to overcome there are
[1:00:53] Temptations around us but there must be
[1:00:56] a power in our life that we're not
[1:00:58] drifting here and drifting there and
[1:01:01] drifting here but it's a power that when
[1:01:03] we come into shallow times and shallow
[1:01:07] Waters but there's a power
[1:01:10] that'll move us into deep Waters
[1:01:13] again
[1:01:15] he said God wants to mold and make us
[1:01:18] what he wants us to be
[1:01:20] he said how can God do that when we
[1:01:22] won't stand still for him to do it we
[1:01:24] want to be our own Master we want to
[1:01:27] think our own way of thinking
[1:01:28] and he said many people who even come
[1:01:30] and they'll join a church and they don't
[1:01:33] even consider what does that church
[1:01:35] believe
[1:01:37] well I'm going to church
[1:01:39] you could be going to church and it'd be
[1:01:41] almost the same as going to a nightclub
[1:01:45] depends on what that church stands for
[1:01:47] is it because a Man packs a Bible to the
[1:01:50] pulpit does not mean it's the gospel are
[1:01:54] you hearing me the gospel is the power
[1:01:56] of God in demonstration that deals with
[1:01:59] your life that brings Jesus Christ from
[1:02:02] the sea that lifts the word from just a
[1:02:04] letter to a living reality what is that
[1:02:07] that is the sword of the Lord that goes
[1:02:11] down and deals with our lives
[1:02:16] for the word of God King not
[1:02:18] gospel came not in word only but through
[1:02:21] Power and demonstration
[1:02:24] and I don't put no knock on no church
[1:02:26] but when we're not just here as a member
[1:02:29] we're not just becoming you know we're
[1:02:31] not just coming we want to know what
[1:02:33] does it stand for
[1:02:35] right because what the church stands for
[1:02:37] I want to stand for
[1:02:40] not just floating and drifting because
[1:02:42] he said if we do that we'll never amount
[1:02:45] to anything
[1:02:47] and we got to think about it because one
[1:02:49] of these days
[1:02:51] we're going to be in the Valley of the
[1:02:52] Shadows of death
[1:02:54] no matter how young how old you are
[1:02:56] let me just say this the Rapture is upon
[1:02:59] us
[1:03:01] I'm not a News Junkie I'll just tell you
[1:03:03] that right now
[1:03:04] and even looking at a lot of times I'll
[1:03:06] stop that some some years ago out of I
[1:03:09] don't I just the thing what I'm saying
[1:03:11] though there's enough that you see even
[1:03:14] where the changing of the standard where
[1:03:15] the dollar is no longer held to be the
[1:03:19] standard for trade
[1:03:21] I'm telling you there's a lot of things
[1:03:22] that's already
[1:03:29] got those things but it ought to be a
[1:03:31] welcoming in our life and really
[1:03:34] examining by the spirit of God lord the
[1:03:37] hour that I'm living in it's not an hour
[1:03:40] to be a casual church member it's an
[1:03:44] hour to be on fire it's an hour to
[1:03:47] really shirk God let me tell you the
[1:03:50] Rapture is not going to come to Rapture
[1:03:52] knowledge
[1:03:53] I know the Rapture is coming to Rapture
[1:03:57] the raptured
[1:04:02] it'll be a sad day one of these days
[1:04:04] when lives come in like look and walk
[1:04:06] into this parking lot
[1:04:08] and maybe you come in the same late time
[1:04:10] you always do
[1:04:11] and you realize where all the cars at
[1:04:13] nobody notified me we weren't going to
[1:04:16] have a meeting
[1:04:18] brother Sammy don't you believe
[1:04:19] everybody's going I preach and I was
[1:04:21] extreme I call out that everybody's
[1:04:23] going to make it but you every Bible
[1:04:25] said the Bible said let a man work out
[1:04:28] his own salvation with fear and
[1:04:31] trembling
[1:04:32] I can't take nobody there but there's a
[1:04:35] gospel there's a life there's a token
[1:04:37] that's here there's a blood that's here
[1:04:39] that can set you free and give you faith
[1:04:42] and bring delivered you in your life but
[1:04:44] you've got to want it
[1:04:46] [Applause]
[1:04:50] you talking about torment showing up to
[1:04:53] them doors and all of a sudden the
[1:04:54] thought strikes
[1:04:56] oh Lord
[1:04:58] it was a rapture and you missed it
[1:05:03] right it really behooves us to
[1:05:04] contemplate those things
[1:05:06] you'll either meet him
[1:05:08] as a masterpiece I want you to think how
[1:05:11] brother Brown said you either meet him
[1:05:12] as a masterpiece that he has worked on
[1:05:15] or a floating piece of driftwood
[1:05:18] to go into your final destination
[1:05:21] and I like how brother Brown says this
[1:05:23] right here
[1:05:24] so don't use this life you ever think
[1:05:27] about that
[1:05:28] our life is what's entrusted to us to
[1:05:31] use how are we going to use it
[1:05:34] such when I've stood
[1:05:36] to what our young people
[1:05:38] told countless other young people that
[1:05:40] have stood and ministered to your life
[1:05:43] is like funds
[1:05:45] that God has entrusted to you
[1:05:48] you can either waste it
[1:05:50] use it or invest it
[1:05:55] nobody in here that's that's a choice
[1:05:58] and they're not just young people it's
[1:06:00] all of it I think that's what it comes
[1:06:02] down to that even as We Gather here in
[1:06:04] services and we're Gathering into this
[1:06:06] moment don't just use this life to drift
[1:06:09] around float around get a better job
[1:06:11] dress better get a new television I hope
[1:06:13] we ain't getting new televisions
[1:06:16] but then again if we take the television
[1:06:18] out there some people lose vision
[1:06:20] altogether
[1:06:22] whoo
[1:06:24] preach brother Samuel
[1:06:27] oh brother let me tell you whatever you
[1:06:29] feed on affects you
[1:06:33] whatever you feed on affects you
[1:06:37] and there is avenues that all of that
[1:06:39] comes through
[1:06:42] Avenues oh I know I know we want to
[1:06:45] sanctify it
[1:06:47] or a better car life means more than
[1:06:50] that
[1:06:51] don't try to use it to say well if the
[1:06:54] rest of them join church I will too over
[1:06:56] to the salmon this is you're preaching
[1:06:58] domestic Believers I know that
[1:07:01] this is a message two message Believers
[1:07:03] this was a message preached at Branham
[1:07:06] Tabernacle
[1:07:08] all right straight is the gate
[1:07:11] now is the way and few there be that
[1:07:14] find it
[1:07:16] I tell your brother REM said that he
[1:07:18] saved to speaks to us of how but out of
[1:07:20] every generation there's only a few now
[1:07:22] remember each day there is an ending to
[1:07:25] a generation
[1:07:26] and how few of that is now you know to a
[1:07:30] real believer as we're talking about
[1:07:32] their faith on Thursday night it's not
[1:07:34] something that I'm worried about that
[1:07:36] I'm unsettled about I know in whom I
[1:07:38] have believed there is a witness in my
[1:07:41] heart and in my life it's not what I say
[1:07:44] my life says it
[1:07:46] all right are you with me
[1:07:49] broad is the way that leads to
[1:07:51] destruction and many that go therein
[1:07:52] we've got to have a purpose of something
[1:07:54] we've got to have a purpose something
[1:07:57] some reason
[1:07:59] I don't think anybody I don't think
[1:08:01] anybody wants to be known as driftwood
[1:08:05] where you just float around
[1:08:08] I mean you might anchor down a job for
[1:08:10] years on end but you floated in your
[1:08:12] spiritual life
[1:08:14] that's right you've drifted around
[1:08:17] drifted from here to there let me just
[1:08:19] tell you something friends I'm gonna be
[1:08:21] very honest a lot of times where people
[1:08:23] are calling and saying they need I need
[1:08:25] to change churches the reality is them
[1:08:27] many times they need to get the Holy
[1:08:29] Ghost
[1:08:30] they need to meet God
[1:08:33] because this changing Church ain't gonna
[1:08:36] do it
[1:08:37] now it's different than somebody not
[1:08:39] preaching the word but friends I I just
[1:08:41] don't see that I I'm looking at
[1:08:43] situation because you say why I have
[1:08:45] heard it I have seen it I've had it said
[1:08:47] to me and what is my response you need
[1:08:50] to get the Holy Ghost because if you
[1:08:52] don't get the Holy Ghost you'll be the
[1:08:54] same way wherever you go
[1:08:56] you gotta see that it's not a building
[1:08:59] that changes you
[1:09:02] it's not a man that changes you you've
[1:09:05] got to meet God for yourself
[1:09:09] you can't live under an anointing that
[1:09:12] comes from preaching and just live under
[1:09:14] an anointing from a service the
[1:09:16] anointing I'm talking about is the
[1:09:18] anointing of the word which is the holy
[1:09:21] ghost coming to the seed of God
[1:09:27] but the man talks about in days gone by
[1:09:30] he said how many times he said man the
[1:09:33] command would come to God he had a
[1:09:35] purpose of doing it
[1:09:37] he said now here's the question he asked
[1:09:40] is your purpose just to drift
[1:09:43] with that congregation or is it to look
[1:09:45] up towards God
[1:09:47] I ask you
[1:09:48] what's your purpose here
[1:09:50] to drift
[1:09:52] with the congregation
[1:09:54] or is it to look up to God
[1:09:57] this is personal
[1:09:59] this is personal
[1:10:01] it's not me following somebody else it's
[1:10:03] between you and God
[1:10:06] that's how important that is the rapture
[1:10:08] is between you and God
[1:10:09] the token is between you and God
[1:10:12] think about Daniel Brethren takes this
[1:10:14] up right here I know I'm taking some
[1:10:16] time but I'm laying this in Daniel was
[1:10:18] down in Babylon and remember Daniel
[1:10:20] himself he purposed in his heart that's
[1:10:22] what the Bible said that no matter what
[1:10:24] they did to him he wasn't going to
[1:10:26] defile himself with a Babylonian sin
[1:10:29] and brother Ram said if we had more
[1:10:31] Gallant men like that that would purpose
[1:10:33] in your heart I am a Christian I'm going
[1:10:37] to find out every divine blessing that
[1:10:40] belongs to me
[1:10:41] so in other words I'm not preaching a
[1:10:44] socialistic Jesus
[1:10:46] that blessings just show up in the
[1:10:48] mailbox
[1:10:50] who but tell me what are you doing I'm
[1:10:52] having to address because that Spirit
[1:10:54] wants to affect even people's thinking
[1:10:57] as though well I said under a Ministry I
[1:10:59] come to church we're not entitled to
[1:11:02] anything we have rights but we have to
[1:11:04] take those rights and recognize what
[1:11:06] they belong to us and battle through
[1:11:08] every force of hell every demon that
[1:11:11] would want to try to keep us from it and
[1:11:13] remove every Spirit over on our
[1:11:16] inheritance
[1:11:18] amen I want to find out every divine
[1:11:21] blessing that belongs to me
[1:11:23] want to know what belongs to me listen
[1:11:25] to this and claim it if the Bible
[1:11:28] teaches that I can receive the Holy
[1:11:30] Spirit I'm going to stay on my knees
[1:11:33] till God gives me the Holy Spirit and
[1:11:37] just not drift
[1:11:42] Hebrews 11 1.
[1:11:48] I think what I said before about
[1:11:49] churches I think that's I think that's
[1:11:51] pretty self-explanatory I friends I
[1:11:54] understand there's some situations but I
[1:11:56] think there's also things too you know I
[1:11:58] might have been born in 75 but it wasn't
[1:12:01] just yesterday
[1:12:04] why would you say that for for if a
[1:12:08] person or individual why would you say
[1:12:09] of that right there because friends if
[1:12:11] we don't come to a realization of what's
[1:12:13] really needed yes then things continue
[1:12:17] on
[1:12:18] right you move out of one house into
[1:12:21] another house the house ain't the
[1:12:22] problem it's what's in the house
[1:12:26] now let's look at this here because with
[1:12:28] the purpose in order to serve this
[1:12:30] purpose we're talking about the
[1:12:32] anointing that's come to serve that
[1:12:33] purpose and that anointing is Faith now
[1:12:36] let's look at this in Hebrews 11 1 faith
[1:12:39] is the substance of things hoped for and
[1:12:42] the evidence of Things Not Seen faith is
[1:12:45] real
[1:12:47] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:12:50] report now think of this the elders even
[1:12:53] those that were wrote here in God's Hall
[1:12:56] of Fame were by Faith by Faith by faith
[1:12:58] and by it they obtained a good report so
[1:13:03] God had a purpose for Abel God had a
[1:13:06] purpose for Noah but they were unable to
[1:13:08] obtain it without faith
[1:13:13] so there's only one thing that'll put
[1:13:15] purpose to work is faith
[1:13:18] right and there's only one that can
[1:13:21] build that faith and bring that Faith to
[1:13:23] what we're speaking of to where it
[1:13:25] becomes substance where it becomes
[1:13:27] evidence and that is God himself in
[1:13:30] other words taking Driftwood and
[1:13:33] hollowing it out and then shaping it and
[1:13:37] making it a vessel that he can ride in
[1:13:41] and there is power to guide it through
[1:13:43] the streams of life
[1:13:46] through faith not by revelation we
[1:13:49] understand that the worlds were framed
[1:13:52] by the word of God did it all happen at
[1:13:55] once no
[1:13:57] but day by day Moment by moment is that
[1:14:00] right
[1:14:01] so that things which are seen were not
[1:14:05] made of things which do appear that is
[1:14:07] such a precious precious law right there
[1:14:10] that that things that that are to be
[1:14:12] made manifest do not come from things
[1:14:16] we've seen in other words change that we
[1:14:19] want to see out here in this realm does
[1:14:22] not come from an outside Source it comes
[1:14:25] from an unseen Source it comes from an
[1:14:28] invisible God and there's no other way
[1:14:30] other than by the spoken word of
[1:14:32] almighty God that is the original life
[1:14:35] that's the original way God said let
[1:14:38] there be light and there was light
[1:14:42] God's way and God speaks and then the
[1:14:45] word comes into manifestation through
[1:14:48] faith we understand that the word is
[1:14:52] made manifest and becomes material verse
[1:14:55] 6 of Hebrews 11 without faith
[1:14:59] it is impossible
[1:15:02] somebody say impossible
[1:15:04] to please him
[1:15:06] this word impossible means
[1:15:09] without strength to be impotent
[1:15:11] powerless weakly disabled unable to be
[1:15:14] done without faith
[1:15:16] we're without strength
[1:15:18] so now we're seeing that this faith
[1:15:22] is a faith that has a power in it
[1:15:26] it has power it has life it's not weak
[1:15:29] it's not disabled it's not impotent it's
[1:15:32] not without it's not or without strength
[1:15:34] so the only thing you can be talking
[1:15:36] about this faith it has to be talking
[1:15:39] about God
[1:15:42] that's what we're talking about here we
[1:15:45] all we all have human Faith I'll get to
[1:15:47] that in a moment we all have that but
[1:15:50] this right here that we're talking about
[1:15:51] is not human Faith this is God's Divine
[1:15:55] faith
[1:15:57] is that right we can go by human Faith a
[1:16:00] long time but will never satisfy the
[1:16:04] purpose of God by human faith alone
[1:16:06] it'll take Divine faith stepping down
[1:16:10] behind our faith
[1:16:13] well brother Samuel said that faith is
[1:16:15] the victory that overcometh the world
[1:16:17] this is the victory the overcometh world
[1:16:18] even our faith
[1:16:20] right and Jesus Christ is overcoming
[1:16:23] through you you're an overcomer but how
[1:16:25] are you an overcomer how am I an
[1:16:27] overcomer we are Overcoming By the blood
[1:16:29] of the Lamb because it is his life that
[1:16:32] is living through us it's not I or You
[1:16:34] who is overcoming of ourselves not him
[1:16:36] that will it nor runeth but God that
[1:16:38] showeth Mercy it is God on the inside it
[1:16:41] is the Overcomer of the holy spirit
[1:16:43] inside and working in our life so when
[1:16:46] it says even our faith it's not speaking
[1:16:49] of our human faith alone it is speaking
[1:16:52] of God's faith motivating Our Lives
[1:16:56] notice without faith it's impossible to
[1:16:59] please God for he that cometh to God
[1:17:01] must believe that he is
[1:17:04] and that is a rewarder of them that
[1:17:06] diligently seek him
[1:17:08] I want to know what all that God has for
[1:17:10] me
[1:17:11] I want to search it out
[1:17:15] if it's too high for me to get to then
[1:17:17] let me get a spiritual ladder and get to
[1:17:19] it
[1:17:20] are you hearing me now
[1:17:22] I can try to stand on my tiptoes and get
[1:17:24] to it
[1:17:26] I know some people here you've never
[1:17:27] seen the top refrigerator
[1:17:29] I understand that but let me tell you
[1:17:31] something there's there's some places in
[1:17:33] God that we're not going to be able to
[1:17:35] get to by just standing on our feet
[1:17:36] we're not even going to be able to get
[1:17:39] toe and see it well brother Sammy I need
[1:17:41] a ladder well well I'll tell you how the
[1:17:43] latter is we're the only way up is the
[1:17:45] way down is when we humble ourselves in
[1:17:48] the presence of almighty God where our
[1:17:51] heart comes in humility and says search
[1:17:53] me out oh God that promise belongs to me
[1:17:55] I want that promised Lord that belongs
[1:17:58] to me so if there's anything in me
[1:18:01] that's hindering me from ascending to
[1:18:03] those Heights coming out of my life Lord
[1:18:06] what is it that's a gallon man that's a
[1:18:09] gallon woman that's purpose everything
[1:18:11] that God has for me I want it
[1:18:18] Now watch how important this faith is
[1:18:20] brother Brown would say it like this
[1:18:23] and the message by faith Moses he talks
[1:18:26] about
[1:18:27] how that science has come in
[1:18:29] to explain away God's word
[1:18:32] that ain't nothing new
[1:18:35] the devil wanted to do that back in the
[1:18:37] days of Noah
[1:18:39] they could shoot the moon and they could
[1:18:41] prove there ain't no water up there
[1:18:43] true come on friend the Bible how many
[1:18:46] I'm quoting the Bible the Bible said
[1:18:47] there ain't nothing new Under the Sun
[1:18:50] is that right
[1:18:52] sometimes we think that all of a sudden
[1:18:53] we've come to oh we've become so smart
[1:18:55] in this generation listen this
[1:18:57] generation is only a reproducing of the
[1:19:01] generation as it was in the days of Noah
[1:19:03] and as it was in the days of life you
[1:19:05] say why would God identify those two
[1:19:06] because within that lot had to come out
[1:19:10] and Noah went in so in order in this
[1:19:13] generation there is a power and a Grace
[1:19:16] that is given to call you and I out of
[1:19:19] the world and take us into Christ
[1:19:22] that's the revealing of the son of man
[1:19:24] that calls us out of the world and takes
[1:19:27] us into Christ under the shed blood of
[1:19:30] the Lamb to where a man or a woman can
[1:19:32] no longer be the same but they've been
[1:19:34] chainsaw glory be to God by the spirit
[1:19:37] of almighty God
[1:19:40] if we ever lose this great faith brother
[1:19:42] Ram keeps going with this statement let
[1:19:44] me just read to you some of the things
[1:19:45] he talks about if we ever lose this
[1:19:48] great faith
[1:19:51] now
[1:19:53] you're talking about this Faith Of God
[1:19:55] being among the church talking about
[1:19:56] faith being among the people of God if
[1:19:59] we ever lose this great faith then we
[1:20:01] are totally in darkness
[1:20:06] he goes on to say if we lose this faith
[1:20:09] we'll never get a prayer answered by God
[1:20:14] we don't know if it's a scripture if our
[1:20:16] heart condemneth God is greater than our
[1:20:18] heart
[1:20:19] if we lose this faith if we lose this
[1:20:21] reality because when we pray prayer is
[1:20:24] not I hope it happens
[1:20:27] for the same here what is he and that
[1:20:29] that seems like what I've got then let
[1:20:30] me tell you something the problem is
[1:20:33] what is there that's causing you not to
[1:20:36] have faith in the promise you're
[1:20:38] approaching
[1:20:39] open brother Samuel I just don't got the
[1:20:41] Holy Ghost yet but you have faith but
[1:20:43] you're allowing things in your life to
[1:20:45] keep it covered up and covered over and
[1:20:48] Satan's doing that to bind you up so
[1:20:51] your faith can't be let loose in the
[1:20:53] right way you might be asking God for
[1:20:55] things but are you asking in faith are
[1:20:57] you asking in Hope
[1:20:59] because if you're asking hope it'll
[1:21:01] never be answered
[1:21:02] the Bible said let a man asking faith is
[1:21:05] that right
[1:21:07] so there's never there's no way to
[1:21:09] please God Only by faith if we lose
[1:21:11] Faith we'll never get prayer answered by
[1:21:12] God
[1:21:14] our prayers he goes on to say our
[1:21:17] prayers are annulled
[1:21:18] and we don't get nowhere
[1:21:23] if we lose Faith all hopes are gone
[1:21:27] if we lose faith
[1:21:29] all our spiritual reality
[1:21:32] is gone
[1:21:35] if we lose faith we lose our Glory
[1:21:41] that's how important faith is
[1:21:43] right so faith is our Glory faith is our
[1:21:47] assurance
[1:21:48] faith is our connection to God
[1:21:51] right these senses are the connection to
[1:21:54] this Earth but Faith was the sense that
[1:21:57] man was given by God that he might
[1:21:59] contact his Heavenly Father
[1:22:02] oh my so if we get away from Faith then
[1:22:05] what do we have all we have is
[1:22:06] intellectual realm where we're
[1:22:08] explaining this and explaining that and
[1:22:10] going through this and it all becomes
[1:22:12] human inspiration
[1:22:15] is that right
[1:22:17] but real inspiration comes by doing the
[1:22:19] will of God whether he said it's just
[1:22:21] one or just a handful whether it's a big
[1:22:24] church or a small Church it don't matter
[1:22:25] whether he's great eloquent speaker or
[1:22:28] just a man that hardly knows his ABC
[1:22:29] they don't matter it depends on the
[1:22:31] message he's bringing whether it's
[1:22:33] inspired by the word of God or is it
[1:22:36] inspired by intellectual conceptions of
[1:22:39] human inspiration
[1:22:41] he said it's only through God's
[1:22:43] Everlasting Eternal blessed word can we
[1:22:46] receive inspiration that's given by the
[1:22:49] Holy Ghost and by faith we receive it so
[1:22:52] God's sins true gifts to make himself
[1:22:55] known to his people
[1:22:58] is that right he makes him something on
[1:23:01] the Bible said there are ministering
[1:23:03] Spirits angels that are sent for
[1:23:05] Messengers come on it ain't just talking
[1:23:08] of the seven
[1:23:10] why are you hearing me now it ain't just
[1:23:12] even talking up a faithful Ministry the
[1:23:15] prophet brings it in the Hebrew series
[1:23:16] and he's saying when you have been born
[1:23:18] again of the spirit of God the Covenant
[1:23:21] keeping God then you too are an angel
[1:23:24] messenger of the Covenant
[1:23:27] because you are a witness of the
[1:23:30] Covenant keeping God
[1:23:31] hallelujah not just what you say but
[1:23:35] your life speaks so loud amen
[1:23:39] oh glory be to God God sends those
[1:23:42] because remember he promised and he said
[1:23:45] a little while the world will see me no
[1:23:47] more but you'll see me remember they
[1:23:49] asked him a question how is the world
[1:23:51] not going to see you but we're going to
[1:23:53] see you and he was speaking I'm going to
[1:23:55] leave as far as the Corporal body is
[1:23:58] departing from this realm but I have to
[1:24:01] go and make a way that the life that is
[1:24:04] within me might come back in you and
[1:24:07] then you will see me how will I see you
[1:24:10] you'll see me through the keeping and
[1:24:13] confirming of the promise of my word it
[1:24:17] will just be an outside event but it
[1:24:19] will be an inside event me keeping my
[1:24:22] promise will bring you in to that place
[1:24:25] of Refuge
[1:24:28] oh glory be to God that's how we see him
[1:24:30] that's how we know how do we know that
[1:24:33] we've seen him the Bible tells us in
[1:24:34] first John chapter 3 he was manifested
[1:24:36] to take away the sin of the world
[1:24:39] and if we are still living in sin then
[1:24:41] we have not seen him
[1:24:45] faith I say like this faith is a
[1:24:48] necessity it's the lifeline of the
[1:24:50] Church of the Living God
[1:24:52] you take Faith away we're in trouble
[1:24:56] faith is not what you can explain
[1:24:59] we understand by faith the world's
[1:25:02] refrained
[1:25:03] not by a textbook
[1:25:05] not by a video clip
[1:25:07] It Is by Revelation
[1:25:09] Amen to our understanding is not by our
[1:25:13] intellect
[1:25:15] right
[1:25:17] but Faith let me just say it like this
[1:25:18] is the sense given by God his grace
[1:25:21] that's given to us in Romans 5 verse 1
[1:25:25] and 2 therefore being justified by faith
[1:25:28] we have peace with God through our Lord
[1:25:30] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[1:25:33] by faith into this grace wherein we
[1:25:37] stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory
[1:25:41] of God now notice by whom we have access
[1:25:44] by faith in Galatians 3 2 remember Paul
[1:25:47] is dealing with a group of Believers
[1:25:48] here
[1:25:50] and they are are being pulled back into
[1:25:52] that order trying to pull them back into
[1:25:54] a law but he said I would ask you this
[1:25:57] question received you the Spirit by The
[1:26:00] Works of the law or by the hearing of
[1:26:01] faith for by in Ephesians 2 8 for by
[1:26:05] grace are you saved through faith and
[1:26:09] not of yourselves it is the gift of God
[1:26:14] so how do we receive faith it comes by
[1:26:18] the grace of God
[1:26:20] amen Romans 12 3 the Bible would say
[1:26:24] Paul talking about the grace that's
[1:26:25] given to him last part of the scripture
[1:26:27] but every man thinks soberly according
[1:26:31] has God hath dealt to every man The
[1:26:34] Measure of Faith
[1:26:36] now I'm not talking about a human Faith
[1:26:37] we're talking about God's faith
[1:26:41] Galatians 2 20 I'm crucified with Christ
[1:26:44] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:26:47] liveth in me and the life that I now
[1:26:50] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[1:26:53] the Son of God who left me and gave
[1:26:55] himself for me so without faith God's
[1:26:59] faith it's impossible to please God
[1:27:03] so God the senses that God has given us
[1:27:06] these natural senses they help us here
[1:27:08] we contact our Earthly our Earthly realm
[1:27:10] the seed taste still smell here so forth
[1:27:12] but to understand that the senses that
[1:27:15] God God never intended that these senses
[1:27:18] would be the dominating part of our life
[1:27:22] but God intended what he had back there
[1:27:25] with Adam the fellowship that they had
[1:27:27] back there where God was there with them
[1:27:30] and they were in perfect Unity what was
[1:27:32] that Fellowship they had the prophet
[1:27:33] tells us in the message Oneness they had
[1:27:35] God's image inside of them
[1:27:39] is that right they were in perfect
[1:27:41] Fellowship God was dwelling there he was
[1:27:44] veiled in their lives now to think of it
[1:27:46] like this that sense that God gives you
[1:27:49] and I this what we just read about where
[1:27:52] it comes by grace that is what the
[1:27:54] prophet would call the super sense The
[1:27:56] Sixth Sense or he would call it faith
[1:28:00] and you see this is how he says it he
[1:28:02] said if you were given this Sixth Sense
[1:28:04] and it only belongs to the Christian and
[1:28:07] you cannot have this Sixth Sense until
[1:28:11] you become a Christian now I didn't say
[1:28:13] you didn't have faith but he's saying we
[1:28:15] don't have that sick sense or there's
[1:28:18] not been an activation until we have
[1:28:21] become a Christian
[1:28:23] so then we're only limited by our
[1:28:25] reasonings and all these other Realms
[1:28:27] out here but once a man has been born
[1:28:30] again by the spirit of almighty God
[1:28:33] remember Jesus said except the man be
[1:28:35] born again he cannot even see the
[1:28:38] kingdom of God
[1:28:39] is that right he only sees it as a
[1:28:42] church only sees it as a gathering of
[1:28:44] people what is it just drifting around
[1:28:47] if it's just in that way but when a man
[1:28:49] can say I know there's something real I
[1:28:52] know there's something that's touching
[1:28:54] my heart what is that that might be a
[1:28:56] life that's drifting but there's
[1:28:58] something on the inside that's saying I
[1:29:00] know there's one here there's something
[1:29:02] that tells me I don't have to stay the
[1:29:05] way that I have there's one who's here
[1:29:07] that's able to anoint the purpose that's
[1:29:10] in my life
[1:29:13] Hallelujah who's given that energy it
[1:29:16] ain't the music it ain't the preacher
[1:29:18] it's the Holy Spirit the Dynamics of the
[1:29:21] Holy Ghost
[1:29:23] there's only one thing that'll Inspire
[1:29:25] the believer and that is the Holy Ghost
[1:29:30] and when he comes he doesn't take us
[1:29:33] away from the word that would be
[1:29:35] counter-intuitive he takes us in the
[1:29:38] word because he is the word
[1:29:44] and you can't have this Sixth Sense
[1:29:45] until you become a Christian and that's
[1:29:48] the only way you can have any more than
[1:29:50] the financial senses that you've got
[1:29:53] now think about it
[1:29:55] that faith is given he gives eyes to the
[1:29:57] believer it's an experience by the grace
[1:30:00] of God that comes to us
[1:30:02] to anoint our faith
[1:30:04] and I want to just narrow this down here
[1:30:07] recalling
[1:30:09] we have human faith
[1:30:11] Peter let me just use this example where
[1:30:13] we have it before I move on
[1:30:16] Peter had human faith
[1:30:18] all the disciples had faith
[1:30:21] even when Peter it erupted from within
[1:30:24] him
[1:30:25] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:30:26] Living God what was that that was the
[1:30:29] representation
[1:30:30] that lay in there awaiting the
[1:30:33] quickening
[1:30:34] fully into the promise
[1:30:37] that's why there's quickening after
[1:30:38] quickening after quickening but it had
[1:30:40] not been transformed
[1:30:42] are you hearing me Peter said I know
[1:30:43] that thou art the Christ
[1:30:45] right
[1:30:46] just like like a person can say I know
[1:30:48] this is the truth
[1:30:50] I know this is absolutely the truth okay
[1:30:52] that and I that that there's a start
[1:30:55] you've got to believe remember you've
[1:30:56] got to have see something to be an
[1:30:58] absolute that you know what nothing else
[1:30:59] is worth seeking after
[1:31:02] right the message is not a collection of
[1:31:04] ideas
[1:31:06] it's the person of Jesus Christ
[1:31:10] is that right now I want to say this to
[1:31:12] you right here here we have it
[1:31:14] Peter had a human faith
[1:31:16] and when things didn't go the way human
[1:31:19] that Peter thought they ought to go
[1:31:21] well Peter all of a sudden cussing
[1:31:25] walking around naked and come on you
[1:31:28] know the scripture
[1:31:29] is that right he just he just because
[1:31:31] there wasn't nothing to hold him
[1:31:34] oh come on now but Jesus said like this
[1:31:37] he said Peter I have prayed for thee
[1:31:40] that thy faith failed not
[1:31:44] what is he saying until your faith can
[1:31:47] get into the right place he couldn't let
[1:31:50] him know I've got to go away and fulfill
[1:31:52] this prayer Peter didn't understand that
[1:31:54] Peter didn't understand the sacrifice
[1:31:56] has got to be offered up and it's got to
[1:31:58] be presented before the Holy Ghost can
[1:32:01] come back
[1:32:02] he didn't understand that but Jesus said
[1:32:05] I pray that thy faith fell not let me
[1:32:07] tell you something right now this
[1:32:08] morning you ought to take that to the
[1:32:10] bank I don't care how Wayward you've
[1:32:12] been I don't care how wondering you've
[1:32:14] been let me tell you something there is
[1:32:16] one who prayed for you and that was
[1:32:18] almighty God it was interceded you say
[1:32:22] when did that intercession take place
[1:32:24] before the foundation of the world when
[1:32:27] the names were wrote in the Lamb's Book
[1:32:29] of Life when he put his name in the book
[1:32:32] he wrote your name Hallelujah
[1:32:37] [Applause]
[1:32:39] then that reveals the revealing of the
[1:32:41] word is the revealing of the
[1:32:43] intercession of Christ it's the
[1:32:46] revealing of the inner tale atonement
[1:32:48] it's the revealing of who you always
[1:32:50] were
[1:32:55] I prayed that your faith fell not
[1:32:58] now I know we could look at Peter
[1:33:01] and we could look at her and say I don't
[1:33:04] know
[1:33:05] I don't know what I'm saying that's a
[1:33:07] steep one right there because it sure
[1:33:08] looks like his faith failed
[1:33:10] well
[1:33:13] he couldn't it didn't fail to wear it
[1:33:16] completely when you read this here in
[1:33:17] the scriptures of what it is where it
[1:33:19] just completely just throws it all away
[1:33:23] now let me just
[1:33:24] can we just take one example here this
[1:33:26] morning
[1:33:30] I want you to watch God's grace
[1:33:34] because I'm certain that no doubt
[1:33:36] every one of us can identify
[1:33:39] at some point in time in your life
[1:33:41] whether today or in the past with Peter
[1:33:44] and then with one I'm getting ready to
[1:33:46] talk about right now
[1:33:47] and what I want you to look at is
[1:33:49] we're talking about to be an anointed to
[1:33:51] serve his purpose I want you to watch
[1:33:53] the unfolding of God's grace
[1:33:56] that comes down can you earn Grace
[1:34:00] let me ask that again can you earn Grace
[1:34:02] no
[1:34:03] it's unmerited favor
[1:34:09] tell me what Rahab did to deserve Grace
[1:34:13] unmerited favor
[1:34:17] we could go on and on but I think this
[1:34:19] is enough to leave it in that place well
[1:34:21] I want you to watch how Grace comes to
[1:34:23] claim and Inspire faith for one to arise
[1:34:27] and begin to claim their god-given
[1:34:29] privileges the right and their purpose
[1:34:32] here's a man by the name of Moses I when
[1:34:36] I look here in the scriptures in Exodus
[1:34:38] chapter 3 the Bible said that Moses kept
[1:34:41] the flock of Jethro his father-in-law
[1:34:43] the priest of Midian and he led the
[1:34:45] flock to the backside of the desert and
[1:34:46] came to the Mountain of God even the
[1:34:48] Horeb and the age of the Lord appeared
[1:34:50] unto him in a flame of fire out of the
[1:34:52] midst of the Bush and he looked in
[1:34:54] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[1:34:56] Bush was not consumed and Moses said I
[1:34:59] will now turn aside and see this great
[1:35:01] side while the bush is burned and when
[1:35:03] the Lord saw that he turned aside to see
[1:35:05] God Called to him out of the midst of
[1:35:08] the Bush and said Moses Moses and he
[1:35:11] said here am I and he said draw not and
[1:35:14] I hither put off thy shoes from off thy
[1:35:16] feet for the place we're on thy standeth
[1:35:18] is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the
[1:35:22] god of thy father the god of Abraham the
[1:35:24] god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses
[1:35:27] hid his face for he was afraid to look
[1:35:29] upon God
[1:35:30] here was a man
[1:35:33] that had walked this same old path
[1:35:38] he had been this path
[1:35:41] he had walked it
[1:35:42] day after day
[1:35:44] I don't know how often it was maybe it
[1:35:46] was day after day maybe it was monthly
[1:35:48] by month I don't know but it was a
[1:35:50] familiar pathway
[1:35:52] he knew it real well he had a great
[1:35:54] understanding of this pathway
[1:35:57] but in this morning
[1:36:01] he catches sight
[1:36:02] of a bush that's on fire and it's not
[1:36:07] being consumed
[1:36:10] here's a supernatural breaks out
[1:36:14] you understand why we need the
[1:36:16] supernatural
[1:36:18] because human intellect is not good
[1:36:20] enough
[1:36:22] this message left to human intellect is
[1:36:25] death
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:28] come on now I'm getting the scripture
[1:36:30] the Bible said that without that and
[1:36:33] Paul refers to it without the spirit of
[1:36:36] God it is nothing but a dead letter
[1:36:40] but this word was meant to live
[1:36:43] and it was meant to live behind flesh
[1:36:47] it was meant to walk in flesh
[1:36:51] Hallelujah you're the Tabernacle that
[1:36:54] God wants to dwell in
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:36:56] God wants to work through
[1:36:58] you're the vessel that God wants to use
[1:37:02] and the supernatural comes by
[1:37:05] and Moses looking upon it and you know
[1:37:08] he realizes in his self
[1:37:12] I like how brother Brian just puts it he
[1:37:13] said he had been a bitter failure
[1:37:18] think of that
[1:37:20] he knew that God was the one was going
[1:37:22] to deliver the children of Israel he
[1:37:24] could talk to you he knew the promise
[1:37:27] yet he tried to do it within himself 40
[1:37:29] years before that and it became a
[1:37:32] failure
[1:37:33] and had lost all the vision of Victory
[1:37:37] and of freedom
[1:37:39] for the people enslaved
[1:37:42] I wonder setting here this morning
[1:37:46] is there one is there some that's
[1:37:48] well I've tried
[1:37:50] but you've lost all Vision in other
[1:37:52] words you can't even have anything
[1:37:54] before you it seems like there's no
[1:37:56] glimpse
[1:37:57] of Victory or a feed of freedom here was
[1:38:01] a man in the same condition
[1:38:05] a man that God would use this ministry
[1:38:08] and it would be a Ministry that would be
[1:38:10] a type of the ministry of Christ
[1:38:14] and yet here he was in a place as a
[1:38:18] bitter failure
[1:38:19] he had lost all vision of Victory and
[1:38:24] freedom
[1:38:25] I can guarantee you when you got around
[1:38:27] Moses all Moses could talk about was
[1:38:30] sheep
[1:38:31] all he could talk about was the things
[1:38:35] in this life
[1:38:36] because it became uncomfortable to talk
[1:38:39] about the things of God
[1:38:41] who made him that way
[1:38:43] wow
[1:38:44] who made it that way
[1:38:47] you see his own efforts and failure
[1:38:50] failed attempts after attempt after
[1:38:52] attempt it had brought such a bitterness
[1:38:57] to where he was a bitter failure not
[1:38:59] bitter against God
[1:39:01] but in his own self so that bitterness
[1:39:03] it would affect him
[1:39:06] to where he had lost all vision
[1:39:10] of victory
[1:39:14] of freedom
[1:39:16] I may know what I'm talking about
[1:39:21] and to see how that God had promised
[1:39:24] to deliver the church but I want you to
[1:39:25] look at this and I want to just bring
[1:39:27] this here to you
[1:39:28] look at what Grace that comes to Moses
[1:39:31] he's lost
[1:39:33] Vision he's lost freedom
[1:39:36] but somewhere down there inside of him
[1:39:38] is still that faith
[1:39:41] that God had deposited
[1:39:45] are you at least somewhere down down
[1:39:47] inside of there is still that Faith oh
[1:39:53] a bitter failure in his own eyes but can
[1:39:55] you see God had to allow him to get to
[1:40:00] that place
[1:40:01] and God allow
[1:40:03] us to get to that place
[1:40:05] listen friends even in our Christian
[1:40:07] walk with God we do not become
[1:40:10] independent there is not everything
[1:40:12] we're going to speak to everything and
[1:40:14] everything's going to move out of the
[1:40:15] way there are times that we have to pray
[1:40:18] we have to pray and we'll be doing
[1:40:21] cranking up the engine that's behind us
[1:40:23] here it is we're cranking up the motor
[1:40:25] well I've been prayed for I'm still
[1:40:27] caught right here what do I do I keep
[1:40:30] praying and I hold on to God I see God
[1:40:32] anoint the man of God anoint the word of
[1:40:35] God anoint my vision Lord I do not want
[1:40:39] to become a person without a vision of
[1:40:42] freedom without a vision a victory
[1:40:44] because where there is no vision
[1:40:48] the people perish
[1:40:51] God anoint me Lord Jesus anoint my eyes
[1:40:55] anoint my understanding
[1:40:59] here is this faith
[1:41:01] that is there within him
[1:41:03] and God speaks to him
[1:41:05] let me just read this to you how to why
[1:41:07] Christ speak
[1:41:09] I want you to catch this
[1:41:11] here was this great gift of faith
[1:41:13] brother Graham says Moses said
[1:41:17] he was anointed in commissioned at the
[1:41:19] burning bush to deliver God's people
[1:41:23] what great qualities this man had
[1:41:27] now this is before the anointing ever
[1:41:29] came he had these great qualities he was
[1:41:32] born for a certain thing God had a
[1:41:35] purpose in it and God has got a purpose
[1:41:38] of you being here
[1:41:40] if you can only
[1:41:42] to that place
[1:41:44] how much trouble
[1:41:46] you saved God
[1:41:48] and yourself
[1:41:50] too
[1:41:56] let me just say this friends
[1:41:59] you're never going to be able to try to
[1:42:01] sort through and undo every little thing
[1:42:03] and this and that listen there's
[1:42:04] decisions that have been made that you
[1:42:07] will have to live with those decisions
[1:42:09] are you hearing me well what can I do
[1:42:12] you can receive the grace of God that's
[1:42:14] coming to you
[1:42:16] remember remember it's us the reason we
[1:42:19] are in many times the shape we're in is
[1:42:21] because we have went by our own devices
[1:42:25] we've got a call we fill a pool to serve
[1:42:28] God but we try to do it in our own way
[1:42:30] and this is why we have caused so much
[1:42:33] trouble for ourselves and also for God
[1:42:38] cause trouble for God he's the almighty
[1:42:40] God he's brought down walls he's part of
[1:42:42] the Red Sea but do you realize there's
[1:42:44] things that can get so mounted up in
[1:42:46] your life that the enemy I'm talking now
[1:42:48] a life that can become so entrapped with
[1:42:51] the carers of this life and why did I
[1:42:53] make this decision and why did I go this
[1:42:55] way hello the reason it is is because
[1:42:59] you're trying to do it in your own way
[1:43:01] you can't do it your own way you've got
[1:43:04] to come God's provided way
[1:43:08] yeah
[1:43:09] that's why sometimes I said before with
[1:43:12] changing churches or whatever more I'm
[1:43:13] not against that friends you understand
[1:43:15] you'll understand right what I'm saying
[1:43:17] but sometimes it said we look at just
[1:43:19] changing physical things it's going to
[1:43:22] matter it isn't that God's after your
[1:43:25] heart
[1:43:27] let him have your heart heal straight
[1:43:29] now he'll answer every question
[1:43:32] let him have your life
[1:43:35] say God right now today
[1:43:39] right here today I'm going to start
[1:43:41] saving myself some trouble
[1:43:43] and I'm going to save you some trouble
[1:43:45] how are you going to do that by
[1:43:47] accepting your salvation for my life
[1:43:51] instead of me trying to do it me trying
[1:43:53] to figure it out I am going to accept
[1:43:56] the anointing of the grace of God
[1:43:59] that's what this message is it's the
[1:44:02] grace of God to you
[1:44:05] it's come to anoint the great qualities
[1:44:10] have laid in your life
[1:44:12] [Applause]
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:18] Moses was brought to the place where he
[1:44:21] was anointed
[1:44:22] brought to the place
[1:44:24] that seed can I read on
[1:44:26] that seed was laying there with an
[1:44:29] intellectual conception with all the
[1:44:32] faith that he had was born to deliver
[1:44:34] the people yet it can never come until
[1:44:37] that light that life that light from the
[1:44:40] burning bush flashed across it until he
[1:44:42] seen not something he read about but
[1:44:45] something he's seen with his eyes
[1:44:47] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:44:50] back oh that did bring things to life
[1:44:53] brother said I think of a woman boy or
[1:44:55] girl in an intellectual conception of
[1:44:58] what they think the word is and so forth
[1:45:00] can never have a full Foundation stand
[1:45:03] until they have met that light that
[1:45:06] brings that word to a reality No Church
[1:45:08] in its practice no matter how
[1:45:10] intellectual fundamental it might be
[1:45:12] that church cannot Thrive until the
[1:45:15] Supernatural is made known among that
[1:45:17] people and they see it something they
[1:45:19] can talk to that will talk back to them
[1:45:22] that vindicates this written word
[1:45:26] if that's what we ought to pray for
[1:45:28] that's what we ought to pray for Even in
[1:45:30] our homes it's a supernatural
[1:45:37] oh glory be to God Moses let me read on
[1:45:41] basing his great call upon the word it
[1:45:44] was great until one day he met this
[1:45:46] light and the Very word itself spoke
[1:45:48] back to him then he got
[1:45:50] his anointing
[1:45:52] and that anointed what he had in him see
[1:45:54] it was already in him
[1:45:57] he had this faith in him
[1:45:59] but he did not have God's faith
[1:46:03] it's like having a car full of gasoline
[1:46:06] with no spark
[1:46:10] are you with me you know where I'm going
[1:46:12] but on the inside the intellects believe
[1:46:14] it the faith that was based upon this
[1:46:16] belief in God that separated from his
[1:46:18] mother and now when he strikes in the
[1:46:19] prince of the Lord light it anointed
[1:46:21] that what he believed it didn't hit it
[1:46:24] anointed what he believed you see
[1:46:26] friends this is why when you work in a
[1:46:28] looking in situations I sometimes you
[1:46:30] can look at situations and maybe your
[1:46:32] life is not where it needs to be I say
[1:46:34] Let There Be say God let a desperation
[1:46:37] raise up in my life Lord God and not
[1:46:39] just we don't just come into the Holy
[1:46:41] Ghost and settle down it is a rest rest
[1:46:44] from sin rest from laboring against sin
[1:46:47] but it is a yieldy to the working of the
[1:46:50] Holy Spirit
[1:46:52] man
[1:46:53] but sometimes it's even that of holding
[1:46:56] a life holding a place holding them in a
[1:46:58] place saying God encouraging them till
[1:47:00] what until they meet that Pillar of Fire
[1:47:03] are you with me not throwing them under
[1:47:04] the bus because they've made all coins
[1:47:06] of mistakes and everything else but to
[1:47:08] hold them that they would be held in a
[1:47:10] place until they meet that light
[1:47:13] are you with me friends
[1:47:20] my
[1:47:22] Lord have mercy what a hollowing out
[1:47:24] that God was doing on Moses
[1:47:27] oh
[1:47:29] brother Branham he says it like this in
[1:47:31] Victory Day
[1:47:34] I love this statement he said just a
[1:47:36] word from God
[1:47:39] on the back side of the desert
[1:47:41] boiled
[1:47:43] the whole thing up again
[1:47:47] it was there
[1:47:48] it just had to have the right
[1:47:49] inspiration to come
[1:47:52] sheep heard and magazine wasn't going to
[1:47:54] inspire him
[1:47:55] sheepherting.com was not going to
[1:47:57] inspire him
[1:47:58] the way to shear sheep on YouTube was
[1:48:01] not going to inspire him
[1:48:03] all it was doing was trying to come
[1:48:05] being a source of false Comfort but one
[1:48:08] was going to inspire him a direct word
[1:48:11] from the Lord
[1:48:13] and that's what God has given us in this
[1:48:15] generation and that's what God is giving
[1:48:18] right here this morning not a different
[1:48:21] word the same word by the same anointing
[1:48:24] by the same Pillar of Fire a word to do
[1:48:27] what boil up what is on the inside of us
[1:48:29] amen where the cares of life would like
[1:48:32] to cover it over would like to Cloud out
[1:48:33] that purpose but there's a word from God
[1:48:35] that boils out that purpose that all of
[1:48:38] a sudden we're sense of Victory sense of
[1:48:40] Freedom where all that sense has been
[1:48:42] lost but here comes a word from God that
[1:48:44] begins to build and says
[1:48:47] you know
[1:48:51] that's who I am
[1:48:53] you see what's happening you're starting
[1:48:55] to identify with who you really are what
[1:48:58] do I do let that same word keep bowling
[1:49:00] and up bringing it up bringing it up
[1:49:02] because you know what happens with water
[1:49:03] when water is boiling it's changing it's
[1:49:06] transforming from a liquid to a gas
[1:49:08] Hallelujah that's what the word of God
[1:49:11] does it brings a boiling brother it
[1:49:13] changes our attitude it changes our
[1:49:15] Outlook it changes the way we look at
[1:49:17] things it changes doubt to Faith it
[1:49:20] changes unbelief it changes us
[1:49:28] foreign
[1:49:30] Moses had a purpose he was serving down
[1:49:33] there
[1:49:33] he had a beautiful woman
[1:49:36] beautiful Ethiopian girl
[1:49:38] he had children
[1:49:41] brother Brian said all this right here
[1:49:42] he had
[1:49:45] but his mission was to deliver the
[1:49:46] children of God
[1:49:48] not from under that bondage
[1:49:50] that was his Commission
[1:49:53] that's what he was born
[1:49:56] where all the rest of them important
[1:49:57] they were
[1:50:00] but not out or above God
[1:50:06] see we
[1:50:07] you never live a successful Christian
[1:50:10] Life Victorious Life if you let other
[1:50:14] things compete
[1:50:16] in your walk
[1:50:18] if you put other things ahead of God
[1:50:21] you'll never live in Victory
[1:50:24] and that's why friends it's got to be
[1:50:26] there's got to be a power
[1:50:29] behind you
[1:50:31] there's got to be a Grace that receive
[1:50:33] in your life that Hollows out all the
[1:50:36] unbelief and all the sin and all the
[1:50:39] isms of this life
[1:50:40] and God comes into control and guide and
[1:50:44] direct
[1:50:46] brother Brown said it like this
[1:50:48] and I close right here
[1:50:52] think of this grace
[1:50:54] to a man by the name of Moses but I want
[1:50:57] you to put your life there
[1:51:00] he said here was a man
[1:51:02] who had been a bitter failure
[1:51:04] he said maybe you've been a failure as a
[1:51:07] housewife
[1:51:08] maybe you've been a failure as a husband
[1:51:10] maybe you've been a failure as a
[1:51:13] Christian
[1:51:14] maybe as a minister on and on he says
[1:51:17] but let that be a has been
[1:51:20] amen this is real Grace
[1:51:24] let it be a has been
[1:51:26] and start from right now
[1:51:31] start from right now Lord
[1:51:35] I want to walk under that anointing part
[1:51:39] I want to receive Lord that Grace in my
[1:51:42] life your faith may not be there right
[1:51:44] where it needs to be right yet but
[1:51:46] listen let him continue to build that
[1:51:49] faith
[1:51:50] until his faith steps down
[1:51:53] I tell you friends this is where in our
[1:51:55] lives this is where we are to live in a
[1:51:58] real victory in our lives before God
[1:52:02] anointed
[1:52:03] to serve the purpose of God
[1:52:06] it shouldn't be a moment I'll tell you
[1:52:08] it shouldn't be a moment that we don't
[1:52:10] put off anything for tomorrow of what
[1:52:11] you can do today
[1:52:13] well you know later on down the line I
[1:52:15] you know I'll do this why not do it
[1:52:17] today
[1:52:19] well brother said no I got to get this
[1:52:20] out of my life where I get that why let
[1:52:22] something continue on in your life right
[1:52:24] now
[1:52:25] and put it off down in the future
[1:52:28] you don't know your life might be
[1:52:30] required of you tonight
[1:52:33] why waiting man you're not in your life
[1:52:35] but what about the rapture
[1:52:39] God's calling to live a real overcoming
[1:52:42] life
[1:52:43] a life that overcomes a life that's got
[1:52:46] a power behind it
[1:52:50] and if your Visions got off if you've
[1:52:52] lost Vision if you've lost drifted
[1:52:56] then be humble before God and say Lord
[1:53:00] renew my vision
[1:53:02] renew Lord God that vision of freedom of
[1:53:06] victory
[1:53:07] let God come
[1:53:10] and refresh that

[1:54:48] just like Lord every
[1:54:51] every part Lord God that within our body
[1:54:55] is for a purpose
[1:54:57] it has a purpose
[1:54:59] then Lord God we are here
[1:55:01] for a purpose
[1:55:04] I pray Lord this morning dear God
[1:55:07] may we be in that place Lord God With
[1:55:10] You Lord
[1:55:12] that father to where it comes Lord in
[1:55:15] our lives Lord
[1:55:17] no longer Lord God
[1:55:19] walking Lord within trouble and causing
[1:55:22] it Lord but I pray that God right here
[1:55:24] this morning may your grace just move
[1:55:26] Lord
[1:55:28] Lord I know father even as you pressed
[1:55:30] upon my heart notes and things that Lord
[1:55:32] God that even as Lord going over combing
[1:55:35] over in the spirit of God would just

[1:55:41] that father there are many things Lord
[1:55:43] we can look back in decisions in Lord
[1:55:46] regrets and so forth but God I pray this
[1:55:50] morning may we lord not reason with your
[1:55:53] grace may we accept the grace of God
[1:55:56] and Lord fully surrender Our Lives Lord
[1:55:59] if there's a life Lord that father maybe
[1:56:02] they've Lord had Faith Lord and faith
[1:56:04] that lays a great quality as your
[1:56:06] Prophet Lord would place it right there
[1:56:08] a great quality Lord of faith that lies
[1:56:11] within their heart Lord but never has
[1:56:13] been anointed by the faith of almighty
[1:56:16] God Lord grant this morning Lord
[1:56:19] I thank God many times Lord among young
[1:56:22] people sometimes the Lord middle all it
[1:56:24] all it really don't matter what age
[1:56:26] group but sometimes the Lord we can get
[1:56:28] in our mind of one certain thing of Lord
[1:56:30] that when we went to an altar this has
[1:56:32] to happen or I've got to do this or this
[1:56:34] it isn't bad at all it's giving our
[1:56:37] heart to you lord it's turning our life
[1:56:39] over to you because Lord God the real
[1:56:42] transformation is when we pass from
[1:56:44] Death unto life Lord
[1:56:46] no sure Lord God I'm sure there'll be
[1:56:49] emotions strike Our Lives Lord God and
[1:56:52] their lord no doubt about that but that
[1:56:54] is not what the new birth is Lord there
[1:56:57] can be emotion Lord but that is not what
[1:56:59] it is because we could be very emotional
[1:57:01] and steal our faith not be anointed with
[1:57:07] the faith of God
[1:57:08] but when that Faith Of God has come down
[1:57:10] lord
[1:57:11] it brings forth a new creation

[1:57:17] moving over this audience Lord maybe
[1:57:19] there's lives and hearts that's tried
[1:57:21] and tried and tried and maybe the Lord
[1:57:24] God within themselves Lord in their
[1:57:26] minds Lord in their heart Lord God
[1:57:28] there's been Lord just such a vision
[1:57:30] that's been lost but I pray God right
[1:57:33] here this morning Lord

[1:57:50] just Lord yielding to your presence Lord
[1:57:52] say Lord I will lay aside my thoughts
[1:57:55] and My reasonings that's what's got me

[2:04:37] his anointing has come
[2:04:39] then it's not come in vain
[2:04:42] it's come for a purpose
[2:04:45] it's come for a purpose
[2:04:47] to anoint us
[2:04:50] to serve the purpose of God
[2:04:53] say Lord with all that's within me
[2:04:56] everything that's within me
[2:05:00] see even as you look even as we look
[2:05:01] through our life
[2:05:05] all of us all of you had a mental image
[2:05:07] had a picture
[2:05:08] of what Driftwood looks like he had a
[2:05:10] mental picture of what a boat I I know
[2:05:12] we were well aware of that
[2:05:15] just to look as we Ponder in our hearts
[2:05:17] where does your life fit at this morning
[2:05:21] why do you come here
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:24] why do you come to this church
[2:05:28] why are we here
[2:05:31] why do you believe this
[2:05:33] what's the purpose
[2:05:37] should be because of him
[2:05:40] because of him
[2:05:44] if it's just a purpose of this is where
[2:05:46] daddy goes Mama goes it can be an end to
[2:05:49] that
[2:05:49] because you steal what has to happen is
[2:05:51] you've still got to meet if your dad and
[2:05:53] Mama have met God then you've got to
[2:05:55] meet God
[2:05:58] you've got to meet God personally
[2:06:01] and to think what God has placed in our
[2:06:03] hearts he's here to anoint it
[2:06:05] he's here to give us strength
[2:06:08] to overcome
[2:06:09] [Music]
[2:06:11] snags in life yeah
[2:06:13] we all go through
[2:06:15] we all have snacks we all have times
[2:06:18] but thank God
[2:06:20] there's a power behind us
[2:06:23] Jesus spoke of this power he said if a
[2:06:25] man believeth on me as a scripture is
[2:06:26] set out of his belly shall flow rivers
[2:06:29] of Living Water
[2:06:31] [Music]
[2:06:32] Jesus promised we would be endued with
[2:06:36] power from on high
[2:06:38] that would be the necessity of the
[2:06:40] church that would be the necessity of
[2:06:42] Our Lives
[2:06:44] is his faith
[2:06:45] motivating our faith
[2:06:49] you realize God would call out the faith
[2:06:51] throughout the church ages he would
[2:06:53] speak to different at different times he
[2:06:55] would regard their faith
[2:06:57] but how were they doing how was that how
[2:07:00] was he seeing their faith it was his
[2:07:02] faith
[2:07:03] that was motivating
[2:07:05] their faith
[2:07:06] so it had moved from something of just I
[2:07:09] know what's right
[2:07:10] it had moved to something that goes
[2:07:13] beyond even what I think
[2:07:16] what even sometimes is considered
[2:07:19] say it this way plum crazy
[2:07:24] to believe that
[2:07:27] to stand like that
[2:07:30] that requires more than human faith
[2:07:33] human faith can go so far to the place
[2:07:37] of eyes can you explain it
[2:07:41] but when you can only go that far let
[2:07:43] God's faith come and when God's faith
[2:07:45] come
[2:07:47] it'll lead you into places
[2:07:51] where the human intellect cannot go
[2:07:53] it'll lead you into places that you look
[2:07:55] at you can even look like Peter oh my
[2:07:57] goodness where am I standing
[2:08:00] here you are walking on water here you
[2:08:02] are walking in the word walking in the
[2:08:04] promises and it's a reality but it's
[2:08:06] just
[2:08:07] it's a paradox
[2:08:09] and you know what a paradox is it's
[2:08:11] something you can't explain
[2:08:15] but it's real
[2:08:18] it's real
[2:08:20] it's real
[2:08:24] let me say this
[2:08:29] the same in what will my family think
[2:08:30] what will this think
[2:08:31] Hey look
[2:08:33] you got to choose what family you want
[2:08:35] to be identified with
[2:08:38] the Earthly family sinking grounds
[2:08:41] but if you want to be identified with
[2:08:43] the family of God
[2:08:45] the family of God has been considered
[2:08:48] nuts
[2:08:49] they've been considered oddballs
[2:08:52] Hebrews chapter 11 by Faith by Faith by
[2:08:55] Faith by faith decisions have been made
[2:08:58] because of the faith of God moving
[2:09:01] behind their lives
[2:09:04] I say Lord
[2:09:06] let it move in me
[2:09:10] whatever you need is this morning I just
[2:09:12] accept God's grace this morning don't
[2:09:13] reason with it just accept it just step
[2:09:16] right into it and say Lord I accept your
[2:09:19] grace this morning
[2:09:20] if it's for your life if it's for your
[2:09:22] heart you can't undo decisions
[2:09:25] but you can make the greatest decision
[2:09:28] and surrender your life to God
[2:09:31] listen friends you can spend your life
[2:09:33] with regrets after regret after regret
[2:09:35] but don't let the Satan trap you there
[2:09:37] when he traps you in all those things
[2:09:39] like that it all it does is further beat
[2:09:41] you down what should I do receive the
[2:09:43] grace of God
[2:09:46] but brother Samuel what about my regrets
[2:09:48] you're not more humble by Rolling in
[2:09:49] them
[2:09:51] what should I do do the greatest thing
[2:09:53] that can ever be done and repent of your
[2:09:56] sin and say forgive me Lord Jesus
[2:09:59] forgive me for my error forgive me Lord
[2:10:02] for doing things my own way
[2:10:06] Hallelujah and what do you do then and
[2:10:09] you say Lord right here's the place you
[2:10:11] brought me to the place
[2:10:13] and the place he's brought you to
[2:10:15] it's the burning bush for your life
[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:19] what a paradox
[2:10:21] what a paradox
[2:10:23] a bush that was on fire
[2:10:26] and yet was not consumed
[2:10:29] what a paradox how you can have the Holy
[2:10:32] Spirit the fire of God can come down in
[2:10:35] your life and consume out every inbred
[2:10:37] sin it can consume out every filthy
[2:10:40] habit every desire of the world and what
[2:10:42] does it do it's a fire of God on the
[2:10:44] inside of a yielded vessel it is a light
[2:10:47] that in the inside has been consumed but
[2:10:50] yet it's not been destroyed
[2:10:52] the same God that can do that is the
[2:10:55] same God that can take care of cancer
[2:10:58] same God
[2:11:00] that took and changed that nature in
[2:11:02] your life is the same God that can take
[2:11:04] care of your Affliction your disease
[2:11:07] Hallelujah the Holy Fire of God he knows
[2:11:10] right where to go
[2:11:12] Hallelujah his anointing has not come in
[2:11:15] vain
[2:11:16] true it's come that our faith
[2:11:19] might stand
[2:11:21] in him
