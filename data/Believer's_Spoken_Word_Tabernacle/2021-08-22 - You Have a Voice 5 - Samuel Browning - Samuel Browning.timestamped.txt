[42:18] certainly just want to
[42:20] really really say thank you to them as
[42:22] well
[42:25] i want to
[42:26] hear this morning we had put out and my
[42:29] wife and i were just i was talking when
[42:32] i left here last week that i certainly
[42:34] would like to have prayer for
[42:37] those who are going back to school
[42:39] whether
[42:40] home schooled
[42:42] college going into elementary school
[42:45] high school wherever it is and i know
[42:46] there's a
[42:50] how do i say it this way there's a lot
[42:53] of things that are
[42:55] are are said
[42:57] and projected and there's a lot of
[42:58] things as parents right now that
[43:01] you have other things to try to contend
[43:03] with
[43:04] and
[43:06] and i can just say it in this way
[43:09] that in every part of your life the
[43:11] greatest thing that we can do for all of
[43:13] us is keep our focus
[43:15] on the lord jesus christ
[43:18] and i'm not just saying that to be
[43:20] saying it
[43:21] but i'm saying it because it's true
[43:24] that everything is to be filtered filter
[43:27] it through that yes and we know that in
[43:30] every
[43:31] just like in every step in every part of
[43:33] our life it's a life
[43:35] it's a walk of faith
[43:37] and faith is a trusting in god
[43:40] that even in the next step
[43:42] that god said take this step
[43:45] that i'll take that step he'll be right
[43:47] there to guide me and to watch over me
[43:50] and
[43:51] we're living in times for the world
[43:55] of uncertainty
[43:58] but not for the believer
[44:01] not for the believer there
[44:03] there is no uncertainty
[44:05] to a believer
[44:07] we know in whom we have believed
[44:09] and we are persuaded that he is able
[44:14] so our certainty is fixed
[44:16] in him
[44:17] and so
[44:19] there
[44:20] and uh there's a lot of there's a lot of
[44:23] things and i'm just you you know where i
[44:25] stand on these things and it's not
[44:27] brother samuel's standing
[44:29] there's things that we can look at in
[44:31] the message brother branham could go
[44:33] into certain things
[44:34] but it would always come back and be
[44:36] balanced right with the word there's so
[44:38] many things that's out there nowadays
[44:41] that's just propaganda
[44:44] from theories they're wanting to teach
[44:46] in the schools
[44:49] to to even a lot of the news feeds and
[44:52] things that are going on that just this
[44:54] and this and this and this is going and
[44:56] the sad part about it is is people
[44:58] ingest it and repeat it
[45:02] that's what's sad we are to have a
[45:05] filter
[45:06] of the word in this hour
[45:10] amen i am not i i just i refuse to go in
[45:14] that channel i stay with the word then
[45:17] i'd stay within that that anchor that i
[45:19] know
[45:20] and whom i have believed
[45:23] and that's what that's where i stand
[45:25] upon that upon the word
[45:28] and
[45:28] i want to say that when we start into a
[45:31] new new school year and some i know have
[45:34] already
[45:35] maybe started some of you will be
[45:37] and i want to just say it in this manner
[45:41] that when job without reading the
[45:43] scripture but pooling just from job
[45:45] chapter one
[45:47] the scripture speaks of how that
[45:49] job
[45:50] he offered up
[45:52] the burnt sacrifice and he's and it was
[45:54] in this manner
[45:56] in verse
[45:57] four if i i'm going to go ahead and read
[45:59] that verse 4 and verse 5 it says his
[46:00] sons went and feasted in their houses
[46:03] everyone his day sent and called for
[46:06] their three sisters to eat and to drink
[46:08] with them and it was so when the days of
[46:11] their feasting were gone about that job
[46:13] sent
[46:14] and sanctified them
[46:16] and rose up early in the morning and
[46:19] offered burnt offerings according to the
[46:21] number
[46:22] of them all
[46:23] for job said it may be that my sons have
[46:27] sinned
[46:28] and cursed god in their hearts
[46:31] thus did job continually
[46:35] and that phrase is a very powerful
[46:36] phrase i'm not going to preach on that
[46:38] today but i just it's just some things
[46:40] that when we look at it thus did job
[46:43] continually
[46:44] it was the burnt offering which this is
[46:46] god's requirement which was the very
[46:49] type
[46:50] of the lord jesus christ
[46:52] so it was the offering up and where
[46:54] job's faith was anchored was in
[46:58] this sufficient sacrifice that god had
[47:01] revealed to him this is the acceptable
[47:05] way
[47:06] and so that's where job's faith was at
[47:08] and thus did job continually brother
[47:11] brown picks it up in the message the
[47:13] approach to god and brother brahm is
[47:15] dealing with how that even he himself
[47:18] was
[47:19] concerned when he thought about having
[47:21] to send
[47:24] he says at that time billy paul out
[47:26] there into the high schools and brother
[47:28] branham would say it in this manner he
[47:30] says
[47:31] you know he says we all as parents know
[47:34] what that feeling is and he's tying that
[47:36] into job when your children your very
[47:38] heart begins to mingle with the world
[47:41] and get out among the young believers he
[47:43] says i he says i don't suppose that
[47:45] billy's into church right now
[47:47] but he says there's a you know he says
[47:49] in our city we do not have a christian
[47:52] school and there's a bunch of worldly
[47:53] children girls and boys too and when i
[47:56] thought of sending my boy to that school
[47:58] knowing that everything that i drilled
[48:01] into him
[48:02] unless he becomes really converted
[48:04] really come to christ that is all of his
[48:07] nature be changed he would be swept out
[48:09] from under my hands as soon as he gets
[48:11] with this worldly bunch because the very
[48:14] nature in him no matter how how being a
[48:16] good boy having a minister father a
[48:19] religious home where we don't approve of
[48:21] any of the worldly things in our home we
[48:23] try to live by the grace of god like
[48:26] christians ought to live the influence
[48:28] set before him i knowed if he was lost
[48:31] he'd have to walk over a righteous home
[48:34] to be lost and i want him to have to
[48:37] walk look how brother of them says that
[48:38] i want him to have to walk over my life
[48:43] and he'd have to walk over the bible
[48:45] he'd have to walk over the blood of
[48:46] christ because i'll certainly by god's
[48:48] grace presented in front of him
[48:51] and i say it in this manner what a what
[48:53] an approach you see the burnt offering
[48:56] itself now the same life that was in the
[48:58] sacrifice comes back upon the worshiper
[49:01] so now our lives are alive that's lived
[49:04] as a sacrifice unto god so who is it
[49:08] it's the sacrifice the same life the
[49:10] lord jesus on display in our lives so
[49:14] this is where we have our confidence
[49:15] sure we have to i know some you know as
[49:18] we we homeschool and others have
[49:21] uh you know children
[49:23] they're going to college we have you
[49:25] know
[49:26] i guess if the doors are open or
[49:28] uh and some things you know back and
[49:30] forth but just knowing in this manner
[49:33] and i know some things are there's some
[49:34] other things that's upon upon the minds
[49:36] as parents even in this time and i wish
[49:39] i could take that off of your minds but
[49:42] i can't take that off of your minds but
[49:44] there's one who can give you a real
[49:46] peace
[49:48] he can give you a peace
[49:50] because it isn't removing the situation
[49:52] it just gives you peace in the midst of
[49:54] it
[49:55] and there's a god who who's faithful to
[49:57] his word and as young people let me just
[50:00] say to you as
[50:01] all of the young people when you you go
[50:03] out there and you're among even some of
[50:05] you that do things you know online and
[50:08] so forth like that
[50:09] there's all sorts of influences and
[50:11] there's young people those have been
[50:12] gathering my house you remember we've
[50:14] been speaking on that that scripture of
[50:16] follow me and just taking just a few uh
[50:20] services on that at our house
[50:22] everything satan has his guns they're
[50:25] trained upon you
[50:27] it's to try to come at you try to
[50:28] influence your life
[50:30] but
[50:31] just remember the training the word the
[50:34] teaching and what you've been under and
[50:37] realize that everything that when you
[50:39] see things taking place out there it's
[50:41] influences to try to pull you
[50:44] in a certain direction
[50:46] it's trying to pull you and trying to
[50:48] lay a hold upon you and try to put
[50:51] trying to push other things into you and
[50:54] i would just say it to you like this you
[50:56] need schooling
[50:57] the gospel does not support your
[51:00] literacy
[51:01] you should have you you should have your
[51:03] education but never let education
[51:06] become your god
[51:12] this is why we have society the way it
[51:14] is they've elevated education and men's
[51:16] thinking
[51:17] and that's what brother bram says is the
[51:19] sign of a communist of windows this is
[51:22] his words power transformation that's
[51:23] what communists do they elevate
[51:25] education and tear down god
[51:28] but this is why that sure we need
[51:30] education you need to learn how to read
[51:32] and write you need to learn how to do
[51:34] all those things but always remember
[51:37] look to the lord
[51:39] let god be the focus
[51:41] in your life let god be the one that
[51:44] stabilizes your life as as parents
[51:47] those that have to go out from the house
[51:49] you put it right in the hands of
[51:51] almighty god and just let me just say
[51:53] this to you
[51:54] god is always invited when we're honest
[51:59] are you with me
[52:01] he's always invited within within
[52:03] honesty and that is if you can say lord
[52:06] i'm a little fearful
[52:09] i'm a little bit distraught about this
[52:11] or i'm a little bit concerned just be
[52:13] honest with him and say lord will you
[52:15] dissolve that
[52:18] are you with me
[52:20] because it doesn't do any you know we
[52:21] can try to say well that if i do that
[52:23] that shows weakness that no no
[52:25] that's inviting him to come and remedy
[52:28] because
[52:29] no not one of us are exempt sometimes
[52:32] from feeling different things of
[52:34] uncertainty and discouragement or
[52:35] whatever that that that comes with the
[52:37] territory of humanity
[52:40] are you with me
[52:41] this is where we have to look to god and
[52:43] say god
[52:44] resolve this in my heart resolve this in
[52:47] my life lord give me strength and give
[52:49] me
[52:50] a peace through this so i'd like if you
[52:52] would if the if the the young people
[52:54] those going to college
[52:57] in school and maybe if mom and dad if
[52:58] you'd like to come up with them i'd like
[53:01] to just have prayer here together

[53:56] we go into those classes one thing i
[53:58] always prayed when i was in college
[54:00] i had heard a statement
[54:02] back and i think brother biscuit was
[54:04] preaching a service in 1995 and he was
[54:07] just speaking to the young people
[54:09] in this service and he says
[54:12] go into the he said everything they're
[54:13] teaching in those colleges
[54:16] he said get in there
[54:18] get what you need and get out
[54:21] there's a lot more stuff it's just
[54:23] say brother samuel did you have a lot of
[54:25] stuff to read through oh yeah those of
[54:27] you who went to college you had to weed
[54:28] through a lot of stuff and there's
[54:30] things right now that you have to weed
[54:32] through within college and now
[54:34] some of the foolishness they're wanting
[54:36] to bring into the public schools and
[54:38] everything else right now
[54:39] but god is faithful
[54:43] what do i do put on the filter of the
[54:44] word just
[54:46] let god just pray and ask god say lord

[58:12] go on back there
[58:14] and you stand there
[58:16] and he said i got he had confidence that
[58:18] the council that zaduk would give would
[58:21] defeat the council of afidifel
[58:25] we got confidence in the holy ghost
[58:28] we got confidence in the word of god
[58:30] that it will defeat every council and
[58:34] every influence

[58:37] bring that satan would want to try to

[1:01:04] in luke 4
[1:01:06] and i've been we've been
[1:01:08] moving through this portion
[1:01:10] in luke chapter 4
[1:01:14] from last week here
[1:01:16] and let's go in verse 14.
[1:01:20] did you pull up the
[1:01:23] slides
[1:01:27] in luke chapter 4 verse 14 and jesus
[1:01:30] returned
[1:01:32] in the power of the spirit into galilee
[1:01:36] i just went through a testing and a
[1:01:37] temptation
[1:01:39] now he returns in the power of the
[1:01:42] spirit into galilee and there went out
[1:01:44] of fame of him throughout all the region
[1:01:46] round about and he taught in their
[1:01:49] synagogues being glorified of all and he
[1:01:52] came to nazareth where he had been
[1:01:53] brought up and as his custom was he went
[1:01:56] into the synagogue on the sabbath day
[1:01:58] and stood up for to read and there was
[1:02:01] delivered unto him the book of the
[1:02:03] prophet isaiah and when he had opened
[1:02:05] the book he found the place where it was
[1:02:09] written the spirit of the lord is upon
[1:02:12] me because he
[1:02:14] hath anointed me to preach
[1:02:17] the gospel to the poor he hath sent me
[1:02:21] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:02:23] deliverance to the captives and
[1:02:25] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:02:28] at liberty them that are bruised to
[1:02:31] preach the acceptable year of the lord
[1:02:34] and he closed the book and gave it again
[1:02:37] to the minister and sat down
[1:02:40] and the eyes of all of them that were in
[1:02:42] the synagogue were fastened on him and
[1:02:45] he began to say unto them
[1:02:47] this day
[1:02:49] is this scripture
[1:02:51] fulfilled
[1:02:52] in your ears
[1:02:55] amen may god bless the reading of the
[1:02:56] word as you're being seated here this
[1:02:58] morning
[1:02:59] for a few moments in his presence
[1:03:02] we're looking and i want to continue to
[1:03:05] work within this thought of you have a
[1:03:07] voice
[1:03:09] and
[1:03:10] all throughout the land we realize in
[1:03:12] the time that we're living in i i think
[1:03:15] when you
[1:03:16] hear how brother branham brings it out
[1:03:18] in the message voice of god in these
[1:03:19] last days i think it's january of 63 and
[1:03:23] brother brahm is talking about how
[1:03:24] there's so many voices throughout the
[1:03:26] land
[1:03:27] a voice of politics and voice on and on
[1:03:30] and on and he says there's so many
[1:03:32] voices
[1:03:33] and brother brown as he brings it around
[1:03:35] he said every one of them voices
[1:03:37] are there trying to deaden the voice of
[1:03:41] god
[1:03:42] they're trying to deaden the voice of
[1:03:44] the supernatural because you see every
[1:03:47] voice
[1:03:48] will have an effect whatever voice we
[1:03:50] give to you know having an effect in our
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:54] you see when you think about when the
[1:03:57] spies
[1:03:58] came back from looking into the land
[1:04:00] joshua and caleb and the spies they both
[1:04:03] looked at the same thing
[1:04:06] but one of them came back and what they
[1:04:08] begin to speak brought fear is that
[1:04:12] right the people were just it it just it
[1:04:15] paralyzed them they couldn't move
[1:04:16] forward at all
[1:04:18] joshua and caleb what they came back
[1:04:20] they're looking at the same thing seeing
[1:04:22] all the same circumstances but when they
[1:04:24] came back and they began to speak
[1:04:27] it was not that which was bringing fear
[1:04:30] which but it brought faith in
[1:04:33] god
[1:04:34] who made the promise who brought us this
[1:04:37] far will take us the rest of the way and
[1:04:40] see depend on what what it was that you
[1:04:43] listen to
[1:04:44] as to the results that it produced
[1:04:46] within the life
[1:04:47] and you know the voice of god is the
[1:04:51] only voice that will bring about a real
[1:04:54] faith within our lives
[1:04:57] a voice of man can bring about a lot of
[1:04:59] intellectual faith and and belief and
[1:05:02] things but this is where that when we
[1:05:04] see this as we're speaking you have a
[1:05:07] voice
[1:05:08] it's not about our thoughts upon things
[1:05:12] it's god's voice his life that now
[1:05:16] speaks to our life whether you're a
[1:05:19] preacher or not your life still is a
[1:05:22] witness
[1:05:23] and that's what jesus said when the
[1:05:25] coming of the holy ghost by this ye
[1:05:28] shall be witnesses unto me
[1:05:32] so this is what the life now coming the
[1:05:34] life god's voice that it utters through
[1:05:37] our life and it should be
[1:05:39] it should be that which brings of
[1:05:41] encouragement of strength to one another
[1:05:44] there's things sometimes that you don't
[1:05:46] even have to know about a person as i've
[1:05:49] said this many times you know just in
[1:05:52] setting here this morning
[1:05:53] there has been battles that you had to
[1:05:56] go through in order to be here
[1:05:59] there's even thoughts no doubt you've
[1:06:01] had to battle in order to come here now
[1:06:04] thoughts of all ranges because satan
[1:06:06] just doesn't give over and just say well
[1:06:09] just go ahead the devil's never going to
[1:06:11] encourage you to come to the house of
[1:06:13] god
[1:06:14] the devil will never encourage you into
[1:06:16] a promise of god that on the contrary
[1:06:18] he'll try to do everything he can to try
[1:06:20] to bring doubt to fear condemnation
[1:06:24] worry that's that's all brother brown
[1:06:26] called it like this and greatest power
[1:06:28] fought that's what satan's army brings
[1:06:33] we're we're up against an army
[1:06:36] this is a battle satan has armies just
[1:06:39] as god has an army and he's veiled in
[1:06:43] his army by his living presence and in
[1:06:46] his army god brings faith and courage in
[1:06:50] his word
[1:06:51] then what he said
[1:06:53] he is god of his word
[1:06:56] so when we we look at this scripture and
[1:07:00] and looking at this in luke 4
[1:07:02] you see the spirit of the lord when
[1:07:04] jesus was reading this here in in in
[1:07:07] from the book of isaiah
[1:07:10] this is he's reading a scripture but
[1:07:13] what what they are are not aware of at
[1:07:16] that moment when he is reading from
[1:07:18] there the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:07:21] it is a declaration at that moment he is
[1:07:26] actually
[1:07:27] reading or it's moved from just a
[1:07:30] written word a revealed word a word
[1:07:33] that's tabernacled now being spoken he's
[1:07:36] actually declaring what isaiah has said
[1:07:40] this is happening right now in your
[1:07:44] midst the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:07:49] and he lays out the work that that is to
[1:07:52] be accomplished what was it it was the
[1:07:54] spirit of god that had come upon that
[1:07:57] word that which was that was uttered
[1:08:00] there in isaiah 61 which is what was a
[1:08:02] part of all of the messianic promises
[1:08:05] that was to be displayed at the coming
[1:08:08] of the messiah here it was it was
[1:08:11] written there because he was to be the
[1:08:14] messiah and when that anointing when the
[1:08:17] spirit of god came down and brought a
[1:08:20] quickening to the word it could not
[1:08:22] express something different from the
[1:08:24] word but it expressed exactly what the
[1:08:28] word had spoken so now
[1:08:31] that word had moved from the page and
[1:08:34] that word was being spoken through a
[1:08:38] living through a vessel that was there
[1:08:40] upon earth and it was declaring this is
[1:08:44] the time
[1:08:45] this is the moment it was the spirit of
[1:08:48] god operating through his word
[1:08:52] god operates freely through his word
[1:08:56] this is why
[1:08:57] the spirit of god calls us to a word
[1:09:00] birth
[1:09:01] that's what the new birth really is it's
[1:09:03] a word birth
[1:09:05] it's not just listen
[1:09:06] many can have experiences and i don't
[1:09:08] think and i've said this over and over
[1:09:10] don't do away with your experiences but
[1:09:13] remember there can be experience to
[1:09:15] experience to experience but it must
[1:09:18] come to a place to where our lives then
[1:09:20] become anchored in the word of god and
[1:09:24] it's god's life being expressed through
[1:09:26] our life to where people that'll never
[1:09:29] read a bible they can read your life
[1:09:33] now please don't misunderstand me
[1:09:34] there's good moral people outside of
[1:09:37] these walls
[1:09:39] but that doesn't make them christians
[1:09:42] it doesn't make them elected believers
[1:09:46] of god's grace remember election has
[1:09:48] nothing to do with our merits
[1:09:51] it wasn't us choosing god it's god who
[1:09:55] lets us know i chose you before the
[1:09:57] foundation of the world that's
[1:09:59] supernatural it's god operating through
[1:10:02] those channels there god's sending his
[1:10:04] word and there's a response on the
[1:10:06] inside that raises up to hear his voice
[1:10:10] and have confidence in his voice of what
[1:10:14] he is declaring about you and about me
[1:10:18] that's a supernatural work that's a
[1:10:21] divine connection between god and his
[1:10:24] pill and his people his children so here
[1:10:27] is the spirit of god so i'll just say it
[1:10:29] in this way the spirit of the lord
[1:10:32] operating in the word is what proclaims
[1:10:35] liberty
[1:10:38] it's not just somebody saying you can be
[1:10:40] free
[1:10:42] because in the book of peter it says
[1:10:44] that there are those
[1:10:45] that here they're proclaiming liberty
[1:10:48] but they're still in bondage
[1:10:51] is that right
[1:10:52] they're they're proclaiming all you can
[1:10:54] be free you can be free
[1:10:56] but the reality is they're still bound
[1:11:00] they're still bound with that sin nature
[1:11:02] but you see liberty real liberty is not
[1:11:06] something out here real liberty is what
[1:11:08] comes in here
[1:11:10] that's real liberty to where you can
[1:11:12] live as a son and daughter of god as god
[1:11:15] intended you to live i believe there
[1:11:17] ought to be liberty in the house of god
[1:11:19] don't you i believe there are to be
[1:11:20] liberty in our homes but that liberty is
[1:11:24] the spirit of the lord and it's a
[1:11:26] liberty that's created by his own life
[1:11:29] by his word moving and it sets an
[1:11:32] atmosphere in the place in our homes and
[1:11:34] right here in the assembly
[1:11:37] now here the lord jesus when he he he
[1:11:40] comes in the middle of this scripture
[1:11:42] because he stops in isaiah 61 and i know
[1:11:46] i've got to move here but he stops in
[1:11:48] the middle of that scripture of isaiah
[1:11:50] 61 2 to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:11:54] the lord this is the year of jubilee
[1:11:57] this is now moving
[1:11:59] from a type to an anatype
[1:12:02] this is moving from a shadow to a
[1:12:05] reality
[1:12:06] he's announcing in this time this is the
[1:12:09] jubilee this is sounding on a liberty
[1:12:12] and a freedom let me just say this this
[1:12:15] liberty and freedom was an announcement
[1:12:18] being declared through his life standing
[1:12:21] in the midst of that congregation was
[1:12:23] here the messiah here was one that was
[1:12:27] represented this is what adam fell from
[1:12:32] this is where the first adam he fell
[1:12:34] from but now stands the second adam the
[1:12:38] lord himself veiled in a vesture of
[1:12:41] flesh to declare that the restoration
[1:12:44] and the jubilee is on for the sons and
[1:12:48] daughters of god you see this
[1:12:50] declaration of the spirit of god coming
[1:12:53] in the word was a witness at that moment
[1:12:56] that it's time for sons and daughters of
[1:12:59] god to come back into the liberty of
[1:13:02] what god intended you and i to be clear
[1:13:05] back from before the foundation of the
[1:13:07] world and where they fell from in the
[1:13:09] beginning now god himself has come to
[1:13:13] bring us back into that place of the
[1:13:15] dominion in our lives to where you've
[1:13:18] got a dominion over sin the flesh the
[1:13:21] devil and the world
[1:13:24] he brings us to that place
[1:13:27] and it's the mercy of god there in verse
[1:13:30] two to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:13:33] the lord and that's where the lord jesus
[1:13:35] he stops right there he doesn't read go
[1:13:38] any further
[1:13:39] because god's mercy
[1:13:41] there is must be an issuing
[1:13:44] of god's mercy notice this right there
[1:13:47] after that scripture here's a comma a
[1:13:49] comma is a what it's a pause
[1:13:52] but right in the midst of this right
[1:13:54] here in the midst of that look at this
[1:13:56] in that comma right there
[1:13:58] that the year of the lord look what's
[1:14:00] been taking place
[1:14:02] after hear the offering up of the
[1:14:04] sacrifice the holy ghost is sent back to
[1:14:07] seal the believers on the day of
[1:14:09] pentecost is that right searches out the
[1:14:12] elect jews before titus comes in there
[1:14:16] and they you know they come in against
[1:14:17] jerusalem there's to be a ceiling of the
[1:14:19] holy ghost it works in that hour the
[1:14:22] gospel turns to the gentiles and the
[1:14:25] gentiles are receiving god is calling
[1:14:27] out a bride that he chose in his mind
[1:14:31] before the foundation of the world is
[1:14:33] that right then to take us in rapture
[1:14:35] then the gospel comes back into that of
[1:14:38] the 144 000 and then then we find now
[1:14:42] coming a day of vengeance of our god but
[1:14:44] how much happens in that space that
[1:14:47] space of time oh thank god that there's
[1:14:50] one that has stood in the gap for you
[1:14:53] and i
[1:14:54] thank god for his grace in this hour
[1:14:56] that's why paul could say the hidden
[1:14:58] mystery that's committed unto me but you
[1:15:01] know what it's not hidden to you you
[1:15:04] recognize not because you have great
[1:15:06] intellectual understanding but you
[1:15:08] recognize that i am a part of the
[1:15:12] mystery of god i wasn't searching for
[1:15:15] god god was searching for me
[1:15:18] i might have been born in a home where
[1:15:20] the message was a standard but god
[1:15:23] visited me personally and let me know
[1:15:26] that i had you in my mind before the
[1:15:29] foundation of the world
[1:15:32] it becomes personal to you
[1:15:36] thank god for the grace that's given in
[1:15:38] the space
[1:15:41] so when we see this
[1:15:44] the messiah here the living word
[1:15:48] standing there and proclaiming
[1:15:51] the word in that hour remember
[1:15:55] brethren tells us
[1:15:57] that they
[1:15:58] could not identify
[1:16:00] him
[1:16:01] with them
[1:16:05] here they should have they should have
[1:16:07] known him
[1:16:09] and let me say that statement they
[1:16:10] should have known him jesus said you've
[1:16:13] got the writings of moses
[1:16:17] these guys could quote
[1:16:18] it right
[1:16:20] they knew it verbatim
[1:16:22] but they only knew the letter
[1:16:25] and that's why brother bram tells us in
[1:16:26] spoken words original seed they only
[1:16:29] knew the history of the god of moses
[1:16:33] they didn't know the god of moses
[1:16:37] brother george alluded to that of simeon
[1:16:39] and anna in his studio on thursday night
[1:16:42] that was a very small group but they
[1:16:44] were in tune with god
[1:16:47] they were in tune with the holy spirit
[1:16:49] that portion that was given in that time
[1:16:52] and they were waiting on the consolation
[1:16:54] of israel let me say this just as much
[1:16:56] as simeon was waiting for that moment
[1:17:00] luther was waiting for this moment
[1:17:02] wesley was waiting for this moment
[1:17:06] is that all right
[1:17:07] amen brother seymour was waiting for
[1:17:09] this moment right here
[1:17:12] brother tells us christ the mystery and
[1:17:14] the token he says they were looking
[1:17:17] forward to this time they knew it you
[1:17:19] say how did they knew it they knew it by
[1:17:21] a promise of the word that there is
[1:17:23] going to be a return of the fullness of
[1:17:27] christ himself to the church of the
[1:17:30] living god they didn't know how
[1:17:32] everything was going to take place but
[1:17:34] as believers they were expecting that
[1:17:37] because it must come for the catching
[1:17:40] away
[1:17:43] did they know all the details no
[1:17:47] they didn't know there were things that
[1:17:49] they were probing at at that time but
[1:17:51] you see it just goes to show if we can
[1:17:53] bring this down to our lunch bucket god
[1:17:56] gives to you and i what we have need of
[1:17:58] right now
[1:18:00] don't worry about you know you've heard
[1:18:02] me say this before the devil gets in the
[1:18:04] details you've heard that phrase the
[1:18:06] devil gets in the details that's why
[1:18:08] brother ram tells us regarding with
[1:18:10] abraham abraham didn't try to figure it
[1:18:13] all out and how this was going to be and
[1:18:14] how that's going to be when he went up
[1:18:16] on the mountain brethren takes us right
[1:18:18] up there in genesis 22. he wasn't going
[1:18:20] to try to figure it out if he'd have
[1:18:22] stopped to try to figure it out fear
[1:18:24] would have tried to get a hold of him
[1:18:25] how am i gonna lose this boy god gave me
[1:18:28] this boy god made a promise if he starts
[1:18:30] thinking about it in his natural mind
[1:18:32] fear could take hold right there but he
[1:18:34] didn't know how god was gonna do it but
[1:18:37] what he knew god gave him to me and god
[1:18:39] will raise him up and brother braham
[1:18:41] said see the same baptism of the holy
[1:18:44] ghost that brought a quickening in your
[1:18:46] soul you can walk to the coming of the
[1:18:48] lord and know that what god did in my
[1:18:51] soul that same god will bring a change
[1:18:54] in my body
[1:18:57] amen he is jehovah jireh
[1:19:01] our provider so what we have needed but
[1:19:03] i tell you that really just takes the
[1:19:05] pressure off if we can just say you know
[1:19:07] what god you know what i have need of
[1:19:11] he knows what i have need of
[1:19:12] there might be just a portion you get
[1:19:14] out of this service here today if you
[1:19:16] can get the thought because it's amazing
[1:19:18] how that god will lay a minute lay upon
[1:19:20] a minister's heart and this way you're
[1:19:22] studying and meditating and all that
[1:19:24] it's it's for one thought god's
[1:19:26] interested in conveying his thoughts it
[1:19:29] may not be my words that get conveyed
[1:19:32] but it's his thought that'll come
[1:19:34] through a channel and it'll resonate in
[1:19:36] your heart so it's not a work of man
[1:19:38] it's a work of god speaking lip to ear
[1:19:41] to his children to build faith in our
[1:19:44] life in the promise of where we're
[1:19:46] standing in this hour
[1:19:48] oh i love him for that don't you
[1:19:50] boy that takes the burden off as a
[1:19:52] pastor
[1:19:54] let me remember that one tomorrow
[1:19:55] morning lord
[1:19:58] under the anointing you say things
[1:20:01] but i want you to say i want you to look
[1:20:03] at it in this way
[1:20:05] you see the bible look notice the
[1:20:07] fulfillment i want you just to to catch
[1:20:09] this the fulfillment
[1:20:11] the when jesus was declaring this day
[1:20:14] the scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:20:18] so there was a sounding that was going
[1:20:21] out in that moment now this sounding i
[1:20:23] want you to look in in matthew chapter
[1:20:25] eight we referred to a few places at the
[1:20:27] close of last week's service but i want
[1:20:29] to go into this in matthew 8 and just
[1:20:31] refer to this scripture for a moment the
[1:20:33] bible says when the even was come they
[1:20:36] brought unto him many that were
[1:20:37] possessed with devils and he cast out
[1:20:40] the spirits with his word and healed all
[1:20:43] that were sick
[1:20:46] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:20:48] spoken by isaiah the prophet saying
[1:20:51] himself took our infirmities and bear
[1:20:55] our sicknesses now who is he he is the
[1:20:59] word is that right
[1:21:00] he is the word made flesh
[1:21:03] so the word made flesh vindicating
[1:21:06] itself in that moment in that hour he
[1:21:09] bore our infirmities he took our
[1:21:12] sicknesses so the same god that was
[1:21:15] there manifesting the year of jubilee is
[1:21:19] on that's the same god that manifested
[1:21:22] in your life in my life in this church
[1:21:26] in your home it's the same god
[1:21:28] manifesting himself declaring the
[1:21:31] jubilee is on
[1:21:35] now he took our in from he lifted them
[1:21:39] we could go on and on through the
[1:21:40] scriptures of those who had who had had
[1:21:44] had serious conditions in their life the
[1:21:46] bible talks about the woman with the
[1:21:48] issue of blood she spent all of her
[1:21:50] living on doctors nothing wrong with
[1:21:52] doctors god allowed that to be included
[1:21:54] there for you and i to show you and i
[1:21:57] that when you've come to your end and
[1:21:59] there's nothing that can be done no more
[1:22:02] even by medicine even as you're praying
[1:22:04] and you're asking god knowing all
[1:22:06] healing comes from god but when the
[1:22:08] doctors say we can't go any further
[1:22:11] there's one who can go further than the
[1:22:14] doctor can go
[1:22:16] when you can't go no further as a parent
[1:22:18] that's one who can go a lot further than
[1:22:21] you can as a parent
[1:22:25] oh glory be to god there's a god who is
[1:22:28] mighty
[1:22:29] who is merciful who is faithful who is
[1:22:32] true who is righteous altogether
[1:22:36] oh my turn with me i don't have it up
[1:22:38] there but i want you to turn them into
[1:22:39] luke chapter 5.
[1:22:44] so as you're turning there to luke
[1:22:45] chapter 5 i want to pick up this
[1:22:47] scripture
[1:22:50] you see over and over
[1:22:54] it's it's truth that is revealed and
[1:22:58] vindicated
[1:22:59] by god's presence
[1:23:01] it's god it's it's god
[1:23:04] condescending down to become flesh
[1:23:09] now look here in luke 5
[1:23:11] and verse 22
[1:23:13] when jesus perceived their thoughts
[1:23:16] he answering said unto them what reason
[1:23:18] you in your heart notice this is not
[1:23:20] what they said
[1:23:22] they weren't saying oh how's this he
[1:23:24] caught the thoughts
[1:23:27] who's who is this standing here
[1:23:29] this is not just a man standing here
[1:23:31] this is god
[1:23:33] only god can discern and catch the
[1:23:36] thoughts
[1:23:38] what reason ye in your hearts whether is
[1:23:41] it easier to say thy sins be forgiven
[1:23:44] thee or to say rise up and walk which
[1:23:48] one's easier
[1:23:50] my sins are forgiven you or rise up and
[1:23:52] walk
[1:23:54] because somebody can say thy sins are
[1:23:56] forgiven thee nobody sees that
[1:24:02] come on now but you see remember in the
[1:24:04] atonement you cannot deal with sin and
[1:24:07] not deal with sickness
[1:24:09] you can't deal with sickness and don't
[1:24:10] deal with sin
[1:24:13] is that right so here is the atonement
[1:24:16] on display the word the messiah
[1:24:19] declaring the authority upon earth
[1:24:23] notice that ye may know that the son of
[1:24:25] man hath power upon earth to forgive
[1:24:29] sins he said to the sick of palsy now
[1:24:31] notice he take the word is directed to
[1:24:33] the sick of palsy i say unto thee arise
[1:24:37] and take up that couch and go into thine
[1:24:40] house and he immediately rose up before
[1:24:43] them and took up that where he lay on
[1:24:46] and departed to his own house glorifying
[1:24:49] god and they were all amazed and they
[1:24:51] glorified god and were filled with fear
[1:24:54] saying we have seen strange things today
[1:24:58] now you see what jesus did he taps into
[1:25:01] it to where they can't see the unseen
[1:25:03] realm of sins being forgiven but he
[1:25:06] takes this what they cannot deny here is
[1:25:09] a man who is laying on a cot he is bound
[1:25:13] he can't get up he does not have the
[1:25:15] strength to do it there is a sickness on
[1:25:17] his body that will not allow him to get
[1:25:20] up but the lord jesus announces already
[1:25:23] thy sins are forgiven thee but he takes
[1:25:26] there a visible evidence right there
[1:25:29] then the man gets up what was god
[1:25:31] showing that when a man has really been
[1:25:34] forgiven of his sins you are delivered
[1:25:37] from the bondage and the oppression that
[1:25:40] you were headed in you're able to walk
[1:25:42] right by the word
[1:25:45] it's a word that brings a healing in the
[1:25:47] soul and the quickening power coming
[1:25:49] into that word it brings the body
[1:25:52] subject to the word
[1:25:55] so it's god god declaring the the things
[1:25:58] that around god declaring what's he
[1:26:00] doing he's drawing them to the word
[1:26:04] are you hearing me he's calling them to
[1:26:06] the sacrifice this is not like those
[1:26:09] that previously which satan did to try
[1:26:11] to throw off when the messiah would come
[1:26:13] you know you know spoke some different
[1:26:15] things and some people followed them off
[1:26:17] in the desert and they got a big old
[1:26:18] bowl of kool-aid and started drinking
[1:26:20] the kool-aid and you know then they all
[1:26:21] turned upside down you understand what
[1:26:23] i'm saying
[1:26:24] that's the same thing where the way you
[1:26:26] know the devil wanted to do with all
[1:26:27] this stuff trying to do all this is why
[1:26:29] you had all those elijah type things it
[1:26:32] was trying to come to take away because
[1:26:35] satan knows that if he can try to get
[1:26:37] people taken away and looking at that
[1:26:40] and people mark things off well there
[1:26:41] ain't nothing to it you see the devil is
[1:26:44] more a believer than many people
[1:26:47] matter of fact the bible says he
[1:26:49] believes that jesus is the son of god
[1:26:51] that's scripture right and he trembles
[1:26:56] he trembles he knows that word can't be
[1:27:00] stopped
[1:27:01] he knows that god will fulfill every
[1:27:04] word but he's busy trying to bring every
[1:27:07] interpretation and every distraction to
[1:27:10] do what tried to get people off of the
[1:27:13] real thing you say how can i be on the
[1:27:15] real thing walk in the light as he is in
[1:27:18] the light god has not entrusted to you
[1:27:20] and i that we've got to go in and try to
[1:27:22] figure everything out and make sense of
[1:27:24] everything that's an old trick and slap
[1:27:26] foot of the devil god has not called us
[1:27:29] to that but god has called us as
[1:27:31] believers and as believers we believe
[1:27:34] him
[1:27:38] you see in the hour that here we are and
[1:27:40] living in this moment this is this is
[1:27:42] the same god brother brown would take it
[1:27:45] in the message who is this melchizedek
[1:27:46] the same god the same christ would come
[1:27:49] back here and reveal himself as son of
[1:27:52] man see the very fullness of god's own
[1:27:55] life coming down and tabernacling in
[1:27:58] humanity in the flesh of his church in
[1:28:00] this last days these are scriptural
[1:28:02] promises are they not
[1:28:04] these are promises in the word
[1:28:06] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:28:09] forever that's just not a phrase that's
[1:28:11] a reality
[1:28:13] he's the same
[1:28:15] and if he'd let those jews go by with
[1:28:17] and give them that message sign and then
[1:28:19] he come to the end of the gentiles
[1:28:21] teaching and let them just go in on
[1:28:23] theology he'd be unjust he's got to do
[1:28:26] the same thing
[1:28:29] so in theology one another we had a lot
[1:28:31] of theology are you hearing me there was
[1:28:33] a lot of loose ends that were out there
[1:28:35] there were there were men that you know
[1:28:37] different things that had been stated
[1:28:39] here or there
[1:28:40] and these are the things you know the
[1:28:42] sad that how satan gets among you know
[1:28:44] and gets among people and well you know
[1:28:46] brother branham pulled from here and
[1:28:47] brother brandon pulled from here and
[1:28:48] brother brown over here correction
[1:28:51] let me correct that thought a minute
[1:28:54] these men had received inspiration from
[1:28:57] god but they didn't have a certainty on
[1:28:59] it
[1:29:00] but god in this hour elijah didn't pack
[1:29:03] stones up to the mountain
[1:29:05] are you hearing me there were already
[1:29:07] loose ends that were scattered there
[1:29:11] so what god did through the ministry of
[1:29:13] elijah this ain't lifting up a man it's
[1:29:16] god that has come down it's god that is
[1:29:19] spoken in this hour god spoke with such
[1:29:22] definite that he could say in his word
[1:29:25] who can but prophesy
[1:29:30] you can't add to this
[1:29:32] if you do it's death
[1:29:35] but god came down and it's god that
[1:29:38] began to assemble truth what was he
[1:29:40] doing restoring the altar calling us
[1:29:43] back to the original sacrifice because
[1:29:46] you can't get the holy ghost unless you
[1:29:48] come back to the word because the holy
[1:29:50] ghost will only come to the word
[1:29:54] is that right because it's the word that
[1:29:57] brings deity in our midst
[1:30:00] is that right
[1:30:02] so here these the the truths and and
[1:30:04] these things where god comes down and
[1:30:06] begins to declare this and god begins to
[1:30:09] come and declare this it's god
[1:30:11] assembling the truth unto himself
[1:30:15] is that all right
[1:30:17] so
[1:30:18] when we look at this
[1:30:20] i just you know i'll just say it like
[1:30:22] this without any any any uh apology
[1:30:26] we've received the perfect
[1:30:27] interpretation
[1:30:28] by revelation
[1:30:33] we've received that
[1:30:35] now there's things that god's continuing
[1:30:36] to unfold isn't he
[1:30:39] but we rest on that part of it right
[1:30:41] there
[1:30:45] let me just say some let me say some
[1:30:46] just real straight statements here god
[1:30:49] has not allotted us to qualify the
[1:30:51] statements of the prophet by the
[1:30:53] scripture
[1:30:55] god has not entrusted any man to try to
[1:30:58] take the statements of the prophet and
[1:31:00] say well let me see if they're
[1:31:01] scriptural this is a scriptural prophet
[1:31:06] you're wasting your time you're out from
[1:31:08] under your order it's to recognize this
[1:31:10] is a revelation brother god is not
[1:31:13] coming back down to prove this again it
[1:31:15] is a sovereign act by almighty god this
[1:31:18] message is not on trial
[1:31:21] it's already been put on trial
[1:31:28] what's on trial faith
[1:31:31] faith
[1:31:32] where is your faith at remember in the
[1:31:34] message contest brother bram said when
[1:31:36] the enemy comes he comes to check and
[1:31:38] see where is the word in your life if
[1:31:41] it's up here it could be talked out
[1:31:44] if it's only in your spirit because
[1:31:46] that's connected
[1:31:47] it can be talked out reasoned out is
[1:31:49] that right somebody talk you in oh that
[1:31:51] makes sense somebody else come here oh
[1:31:53] that makes sense
[1:31:55] but when it's something down here in the
[1:31:57] soul
[1:31:58] it's greater than every bit of reasoning
[1:32:01] it's an anchor it's a reality matter of
[1:32:04] fact you just want to be where he's at
[1:32:07] because it's jesus christ that you've
[1:32:09] met he's the one that's changed your
[1:32:11] life that's what this message did it
[1:32:14] brought a uniting between us and jesus
[1:32:17] christ when i hear this message it makes
[1:32:19] me fall more in love with the lord jesus
[1:32:22] christ i appreciate my bible even more
[1:32:31] i'm just going to say some things here
[1:32:34] god has not allotted us to qualify the
[1:32:36] statements of the prophet by the
[1:32:37] scripture that's where men get in
[1:32:39] trouble that's where interpretations
[1:32:40] start out
[1:32:42] god himself who is the word has
[1:32:44] vindicated this message that he spoke
[1:32:46] through the messenger
[1:32:48] and he backs it up himself
[1:32:50] this is a scriptural message that has
[1:32:52] been identified and vindicated by god as
[1:32:55] the scriptural fulfillment in this hour
[1:32:59] so the call here's the call this is not
[1:33:02] just a title message these messages are
[1:33:03] not just titles they are announcements a
[1:33:06] total separation god's word calls for a
[1:33:09] total separation from all unbelief
[1:33:14] are you hearing me
[1:33:15] and i'll say it like this
[1:33:17] all interpretations of man as a filter
[1:33:20] god calls us from that
[1:33:23] come on that's how they missed the
[1:33:24] messiah
[1:33:26] is that right
[1:33:28] jesus didn't say i'm one of the many
[1:33:29] ways
[1:33:31] my friend do we got an absolute or not
[1:33:35] i mean we're not wishy-washy people
[1:33:38] now notice this here it is it calls us
[1:33:40] from the interpretations of man as a
[1:33:42] filter we receive the filter of the word
[1:33:45] himself that will guide us into all
[1:33:47] truth in the scriptures
[1:33:50] that's why we receive a word filter a
[1:33:52] living experience
[1:34:00] man-made interpretations
[1:34:02] never produce godly faith
[1:34:05] never
[1:34:06] they produce intellectual faith but
[1:34:08] godly faith is the faith of god moving
[1:34:11] through the body of believers
[1:34:12] that's god's objective is that the faith
[1:34:15] of god moved through our life what is
[1:34:17] the faith of god the deity of jesus
[1:34:20] christ
[1:34:21] his own life moving through our lives
[1:34:27] now
[1:34:29] i say that within this part of it right
[1:34:31] here and i hope you understand where i
[1:34:33] am i know you and i'm sure you
[1:34:34] understand me
[1:34:36] but there's things sometimes that you
[1:34:37] you hear things where people and to me
[1:34:39] it should just be in this just being
[1:34:41] this statement here you have a question
[1:34:43] about predestination look the scriptures
[1:34:45] are all filled with predestination
[1:34:47] but it should be something quickly
[1:34:49] brother branham refers to it right here
[1:34:50] quickly those things are referred that
[1:34:52] order that ought to end the argument
[1:34:54] right there
[1:34:56] it's a scriptural message it's all the
[1:34:58] way through the scripture shouldn't be a
[1:35:00] point of contention but friends listen
[1:35:02] to me and i don't say this i'm looking
[1:35:04] down i'm saying that's why brother rem
[1:35:06] said you must burn the old leaven with
[1:35:09] fire
[1:35:10] sometimes it's even previous teachings
[1:35:13] that maybe are not even wrong teachings
[1:35:15] that could be around and i'm talking
[1:35:16] about other things of the message and
[1:35:18] sometimes it's the thinking that still
[1:35:21] gets people
[1:35:22] thinking is though this is what they
[1:35:24] have to do or they have to do this at a
[1:35:26] certain time or if they don't do this in
[1:35:28] a service man they're defeated it's a
[1:35:30] thinking that is sad but remember every
[1:35:34] thought of man must subside and it must
[1:35:37] be that of god's word that has
[1:35:40] preeminence in our lives
[1:35:43] is that right
[1:35:44] amen we want him in our midst we want
[1:35:47] his life in our midst we want him to
[1:35:49] continue to reveal and move his life
[1:35:52] among us now brother branham makes a
[1:35:55] statement here
[1:35:56] in the message blind bartimaeus uh i i
[1:35:59] think i i have this up there and i'm
[1:36:01] trying to get to a place here
[1:36:05] brother braham's talking about how do
[1:36:07] the people uh they
[1:36:10] you know there's not a rallying
[1:36:12] that was going on
[1:36:14] brother memory says in the days of
[1:36:16] solomon how that the people
[1:36:18] they israel began to rally around the
[1:36:21] gift that god had given them
[1:36:24] and you seen the effect of it it
[1:36:26] affected when they rallied around the
[1:36:28] gift it was things that even in what
[1:36:31] their purpose was
[1:36:32] was noticed remember even how the queen
[1:36:35] of sheba she noticed how solomon
[1:36:38] ascended up the stairs
[1:36:40] she noticed how the table was set
[1:36:42] she noticed how they served the meat see
[1:36:44] it was a character
[1:36:46] that was on display
[1:36:48] it had an effect on everything around
[1:36:50] them this is what the display and the
[1:36:52] application of the token does in our
[1:36:54] life christ it has an effect
[1:36:56] to bring christ on display
[1:37:00] so
[1:37:01] now to rally around that gift is what is
[1:37:04] god's word what god had given according
[1:37:06] to earth that's rallying around the word
[1:37:08] and brother brahman says it like this
[1:37:10] here he is standing here and thinking
[1:37:12] where we're at at the closing of an age
[1:37:13] and he says
[1:37:14] now he says we've had signs of laying on
[1:37:17] of hands all down for 2 000 years
[1:37:20] but now
[1:37:22] we're at the closing
[1:37:24] of the age
[1:37:25] it's something different now
[1:37:28] my ministry it's through a spirit of
[1:37:30] discernment
[1:37:32] that it might manifest
[1:37:34] jesus christ's presence that lamb that
[1:37:38] we're speaking of that's been slain
[1:37:42] let me read that part again
[1:37:44] my ministry he says
[1:37:46] it's through a spirit of discernment
[1:37:49] that it might manifest jesus christ's
[1:37:52] presence
[1:37:53] that lamb
[1:37:55] that we are speaking of that's been
[1:37:58] slain
[1:38:00] so the purpose is to make him known
[1:38:04] to the people
[1:38:06] to declare him now listen brother
[1:38:08] branham couldn't do that
[1:38:10] but he was god's
[1:38:12] chosen instrument
[1:38:14] for god to come and declare malachi 4
[1:38:20] through that you and i can say that's
[1:38:22] the fulfillment of malachi 4.
[1:38:25] but there's another part in malachi 4.
[1:38:28] god came and visited elijah but there's
[1:38:31] a you inside of those scriptures
[1:38:34] and the same god that came there to
[1:38:36] identify that word that part that's to
[1:38:40] be acted out and made manifest through
[1:38:43] the life of the prophet now that same
[1:38:45] god is manifesting the you that's
[1:38:48] included in that verse that the you is
[1:38:51] that of the children of god that are
[1:38:53] gifted by god to hear the voice of god
[1:38:58] speaking to their lives and they respond
[1:39:00] to that word brother it shatters
[1:39:03] interpretations of man it's like the
[1:39:05] stone coming to the image it smots it in
[1:39:08] the foundation it brings the reality of
[1:39:11] jesus christ present in the lives
[1:39:16] it's a to reveal him
[1:39:18] to make him known
[1:39:20] now i want to just
[1:39:22] take here just a moment
[1:39:24] in leviticus 25 i'm just going to refer
[1:39:26] to it
[1:39:28] in leviticus 25 we were reading from
[1:39:30] that before god told them number seven
[1:39:33] sabbath's unto you this was an allotted
[1:39:35] season
[1:39:36] it's an allotted time that you need to
[1:39:38] lay out you need to make ready for this
[1:39:41] it's allotted time a season
[1:39:44] and when that when that season had come
[1:39:46] after the seven sabbath the 49 years
[1:39:50] thou shalt cause the trumpet
[1:39:53] of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day
[1:39:55] of the seventh month in the day of
[1:39:56] atonement shall you make the trumpet
[1:39:59] sound throughout all your land now
[1:40:00] remember what that trumpet's going to do
[1:40:02] it proclaims liberty
[1:40:07] it still proclaims liberty
[1:40:10] you might be sick in your body and the
[1:40:13] trumpet sounds to you you're free
[1:40:17] see it still proclaims liberty
[1:40:20] it calls us into the promises of god
[1:40:24] that belong to you and i
[1:40:26] so we're called to return to our
[1:40:29] possession see the word does not speak
[1:40:31] to us and then leave and leave us right
[1:40:33] there
[1:40:34] but the word having an effect in our
[1:40:36] life it builds faith to lay down cast
[1:40:40] down lay aside every weight and every
[1:40:42] sin that does so easy but such it gives
[1:40:44] us strength to rise and to return back
[1:40:48] to our possession now within this part
[1:40:51] of it this is where i'm going with this
[1:40:52] right here that within this the sounding
[1:40:55] of this trumpet and i i've mentioned
[1:40:56] this here a few times that within it it
[1:40:59] was the priest that would ride
[1:41:02] throughout the land brother brown would
[1:41:03] say it over and over the priest would
[1:41:05] ride throughout the land because
[1:41:06] somebody had to sound the trumpet and
[1:41:09] the sounding of the trumpet was an
[1:41:11] announcement that the day of atonement
[1:41:14] was on now there had been days of
[1:41:15] atonement that had been offered up it
[1:41:17] was a looking forward to something to
[1:41:19] come but on this particular time it was
[1:41:22] announcing that they were they were able
[1:41:27] to go free god was was committing to
[1:41:30] them you can go free from where you are
[1:41:33] you can go back to your possession it
[1:41:35] was a priest a high priest would ride
[1:41:37] throughout the land sounding out that
[1:41:40] the trumpet or the shofar he was
[1:41:42] announcing by the sounding you're free
[1:41:46] now
[1:41:47] that was just a type
[1:41:50] but remember it wasn't enough that he
[1:41:52] would just stand there in jerusalem and
[1:41:53] blow it
[1:41:54] there's people clear out there that
[1:41:56] couldn't hear it
[1:41:58] there's people over here that didn't
[1:42:00] hear it it's got to be taken
[1:42:02] this gospel's got to be taken
[1:42:05] you see it's got to be preached
[1:42:06] everywhere are you hearing me now
[1:42:08] you see how the gospel how god laying it
[1:42:11] out that what the sounding would be
[1:42:13] where they that could not see the blood
[1:42:16] that was being shed and it was offered
[1:42:18] up and it was accepted but the sounding
[1:42:20] of the trumpet was the announcement that
[1:42:23] the blood has been accepted and you are
[1:42:26] accepted with the blood it was the high
[1:42:29] priest that was riding throughout the
[1:42:30] land and this high priest i want you to
[1:42:32] think of this here if in hebrews chapter
[1:42:35] 2 verse 16
[1:42:36] here he is for he took not on him the
[1:42:39] nature of angels but he took on him the
[1:42:41] seed of abraham
[1:42:43] god took on himself the promise of his
[1:42:45] word
[1:42:46] is that right god only takes on the
[1:42:48] garments of his word
[1:42:50] is that right
[1:42:51] oh my my my wherefore in all things it
[1:42:54] behooved him to be made like unto his
[1:42:57] brethren that he might be a merciful and
[1:43:00] faithful high priest in things
[1:43:02] pertaining to god to make
[1:43:04] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:43:06] people so it's to reconcile to bring a
[1:43:10] reconciliation to where there were that
[1:43:12] where god and man were separate but now
[1:43:16] they would be joined together back in a
[1:43:18] union
[1:43:19] now notice in hebrews 3 1 it says
[1:43:22] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[1:43:25] heavenly calling consider the apostle
[1:43:29] and high priest
[1:43:30] of our profession
[1:43:32] christ jesus
[1:43:34] consider him
[1:43:37] think upon him
[1:43:38] consider you know that that's every time
[1:43:40] that we even we come together and we
[1:43:42] said in the services it's to think upon
[1:43:44] him
[1:43:47] we come in and we're hearing the word
[1:43:49] it's to move our thoughts from where
[1:43:51] they're at to on him
[1:43:54] to begin to think of things that you can
[1:43:56] look at a situation i don't know how i
[1:43:59] don't know how this is going to work out
[1:44:00] or i don't know how i'm going to get
[1:44:01] past this feeling or how but god comes
[1:44:04] to put our thinking on him
[1:44:09] oh i'm so glad about that aren't you
[1:44:11] now i want you to notice this and how
[1:44:14] it brings it out here within the
[1:44:16] scriptures
[1:44:18] here in hebrews uh in hebrews 7
[1:44:23] hebrews 7 1 it says for this melchizedek
[1:44:26] king of salem priest of the most high
[1:44:29] god who met abraham returning from the
[1:44:31] slaughter of the kings and blessed him
[1:44:33] to whom also abraham gave a tenth part
[1:44:36] of all first being by interpretation
[1:44:38] king of righteousness and after that
[1:44:40] also king of salem which is king of
[1:44:42] peace without father without mother
[1:44:45] without descent having neither beginning
[1:44:46] of days nor end of life but made like
[1:44:49] unto the son of god abideth a priest
[1:44:52] continually
[1:44:54] so our our high priest the lord jesus
[1:44:58] now remember hear abraham returning back
[1:45:01] from the slaughter of the kings he met
[1:45:04] melchizedek
[1:45:05] god
[1:45:06] in theocony formed
[1:45:09] is that right
[1:45:10] he met him after the battle was over
[1:45:14] and he gave to abraham bread and wine i
[1:45:17] don't know if you've ever looked at it
[1:45:18] there in the scripture but to see
[1:45:20] there's all sorts of stuff that's taken
[1:45:22] place in genesis 14. there's all types
[1:45:25] of riches and remember the king of sodom
[1:45:28] is going to give abraham here i'll give
[1:45:31] you all of this and abraham said um i
[1:45:34] won't even take a shoe latcher from you
[1:45:36] lest you should say you've made abram
[1:45:38] rich
[1:45:39] abraham's presented with the temptation
[1:45:41] of ladies he turns it down
[1:45:45] are you with me there's money involved
[1:45:47] there's things involved land all of that
[1:45:49] in genesis 14 it's a repeat of even what
[1:45:51] we see in this hour where people going
[1:45:53] after natural resources all of that lays
[1:45:56] out there in genesis 14. great battles
[1:45:59] are heading in in that moment but it's
[1:46:01] in that moment it's as if nobody else is
[1:46:04] there when god comes down and meets with
[1:46:07] abraham and yet there's all sorts of
[1:46:09] chaos and everything else all around but
[1:46:12] there's a personal meeting taking place
[1:46:16] between god and one of his children what
[1:46:18] about you this morning here we are
[1:46:21] setting in the midst of chaos you might
[1:46:23] even have chaos going on in your life
[1:46:26] and feel like man there's a lot of
[1:46:27] things in disorder but that will not
[1:46:30] stop god from coming down and having
[1:46:33] communion with you
[1:46:35] it only invites him into a place he'll
[1:46:37] bring peace where there is chaos he'll
[1:46:40] bring order where there's disorder he'll
[1:46:43] bring healing with us wounds
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:49] here he came
[1:46:50] to meet abraham
[1:46:53] this priest
[1:46:55] noticed me like unto the son of god
[1:46:57] abideth a priest continually
[1:47:00] aren't you glad for that
[1:47:04] he had to come down
[1:47:07] he had to come down it's god condensing
[1:47:10] all the way down
[1:47:12] if you go to who is this melchizedek i
[1:47:13] think i have that on the notes
[1:47:15] and if you go to paragraph 68 there
[1:47:18] brother braham says now notice the
[1:47:19] difference between him and you as a son
[1:47:21] he was at the beginning the word and in
[1:47:23] morphe body he came in and lived in that
[1:47:26] in the person in melchizedek then later
[1:47:29] we never heard no more of melchizedek
[1:47:31] because he became jesus christ
[1:47:34] melchizedek was the priest but he became
[1:47:37] jesus christ
[1:47:40] oh my now i want you to look here in
[1:47:43] hebrews 7. i'm trying to get somewhere
[1:47:44] just let me read these scriptures here
[1:47:46] hebrews 7 25
[1:47:48] wherefore goes into here talking about
[1:47:50] our high priest he is able to save them
[1:47:53] to the uttermost that means completely
[1:47:57] he don't do halfway jobs
[1:48:01] when he starts something he finishes it
[1:48:04] god doesn't get in a situation and say
[1:48:06] boy i bit too much off here i better
[1:48:09] call the plumber brother drake come over
[1:48:11] here and fix the mess i started
[1:48:14] no no he saves to the uttermost
[1:48:17] he does a complete work brother there
[1:48:20] ain't no going back because he gets
[1:48:22] right down on the inside there's no
[1:48:24] desire to go back there's only a desire
[1:48:27] for him
[1:48:30] to save them to the uttermost that come
[1:48:32] unto god by him
[1:48:34] seeing he ever liveth to make
[1:48:37] intercession for them
[1:48:40] for you for me
[1:48:42] brother bryan that's what it's about he
[1:48:44] ever liveth to make intercession for
[1:48:46] them
[1:48:48] look at this for such a high priest
[1:48:51] became
[1:48:52] us
[1:48:54] who is holy
[1:48:56] harmless
[1:48:57] undefiled separate from sinners and made
[1:49:01] higher than the heavens who needeth not
[1:49:03] daily as though those as those high
[1:49:05] priests to offer of sacrifice first for
[1:49:07] his own sins and then for the peoples he
[1:49:10] did this once when he offered up himself
[1:49:12] for the law maketh men high priests
[1:49:15] which have infirmity weaknesses but the
[1:49:18] word of the oath which was sense the law
[1:49:20] maketh the son who is consecrated
[1:49:23] forevermore
[1:49:25] it's not he one made a high priest by
[1:49:27] the law
[1:49:28] he was made the high priest confirmed by
[1:49:31] almighty god that he was confirmed by
[1:49:35] the word let me ask you something how
[1:49:37] are you and i confirmed by the word
[1:49:39] we're not here serving out of law you
[1:49:41] got to go to church and you got to do
[1:49:43] this and you got to do that if you're
[1:49:45] still there then you can break out of
[1:49:47] that servant mentality you can break
[1:49:49] into a real sonship a real liberty to
[1:49:52] where it's not by law but there comes a
[1:49:54] real word birth on the inside and you're
[1:49:57] made of king and priest unto god by the
[1:50:00] living word of god
[1:50:04] hebrews 8 1 oh my i tell you paul just
[1:50:07] really moves right into this of the high
[1:50:08] priest look what he says now of things
[1:50:11] that we've spoken of this is the son
[1:50:14] we somebody say we
[1:50:17] have such a high priest
[1:50:21] that's my high priest
[1:50:23] he's my high priest
[1:50:25] who is sat on the right hand of the
[1:50:28] throne of the majesty in the heavens a
[1:50:31] minister of the sanctuary and of the
[1:50:33] true tabernacle which the lord pitched
[1:50:36] and not man
[1:50:39] hebrews 4 14
[1:50:41] seeing then
[1:50:43] that
[1:50:44] what's that word
[1:50:46] we
[1:50:47] have a great high priest i like how that
[1:50:49] goes
[1:50:50] we've got a great high priest
[1:50:54] that is passed into the heavens
[1:50:56] he conquered death hell in the grave
[1:51:00] rose up on the eastern morning what's he
[1:51:02] saying he was a fulfillment of the word
[1:51:06] and he passed into the heavens oh my
[1:51:10] he wasn't alone when he went there
[1:51:11] either
[1:51:12] the old testament saints went with him
[1:51:16] is that right
[1:51:17] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[1:51:20] our profession oh my
[1:51:22] for we have not an high priest which
[1:51:24] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[1:51:26] our infirmities but was in all points
[1:51:28] tempted like we are yet without sin
[1:51:32] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[1:51:34] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[1:51:37] and find grace to help in the time
[1:51:41] of need
[1:51:43] in the message great and mighty
[1:51:44] conqueror let me just can i have just a
[1:51:46] few more moments
[1:51:49] in about five minutes but don't tell me
[1:51:54] well let's
[1:51:55] just just really zero in on this say
[1:51:56] lord just let this drop here
[1:51:59] when he came down he was in the
[1:52:01] beginning
[1:52:02] the bible said he was the word
[1:52:05] he was the logos that went out of god
[1:52:08] and the logos in the beginning was the
[1:52:10] word and he became the word
[1:52:12] then he ascended up on that glorious day
[1:52:15] of easter he become not only the word
[1:52:18] but he become the high priest of his own
[1:52:21] word oh he said what a glorious thing
[1:52:23] brother neville
[1:52:25] just think
[1:52:26] he's not only the word but he's the high
[1:52:30] priest of his own word
[1:52:33] how could we doubt it how could we walk
[1:52:36] to him and not believe that we receive
[1:52:38] what we ask for for he is the word and
[1:52:41] the intercessor of the word the logos
[1:52:44] became the word and the word was made
[1:52:46] flesh and the same flesh that was the
[1:52:48] word received up in the glory and now's
[1:52:51] the high priest making intercession by
[1:52:55] himself
[1:52:56] to his word
[1:53:01] romans 8 34
[1:53:03] who is he
[1:53:04] that condemneth
[1:53:06] it is christ that died ye rather that is
[1:53:09] risen again who is even at the right
[1:53:12] hand of god who also maketh intercession
[1:53:16] for us
[1:53:18] he is the high priest
[1:53:20] of our confession
[1:53:23] he has already
[1:53:24] the word became flesh
[1:53:26] but when he ascended up
[1:53:28] on that easter morning and he sat down
[1:53:30] at the right hand of god seated in power
[1:53:33] and authority
[1:53:35] he's there
[1:53:36] as a high priest of his own word to make
[1:53:40] good
[1:53:41] on every word
[1:53:45] every promise that he ever made
[1:53:48] he's there to make good on that word
[1:53:52] there's not one word
[1:53:54] in the bible there's not one there's not
[1:53:56] one promise
[1:53:58] that that he can say well i can't do
[1:54:00] that
[1:54:01] ah
[1:54:02] i changed a little bit since then i i
[1:54:05] can't do that i still don't do it i i
[1:54:07] changed i changed the program a little

[1:54:12] fulfills
[1:54:14] his word
[1:54:16] he still fulfills his promise
[1:54:18] and as that high priest would ride
[1:54:21] throughout the land
[1:54:22] sounding it out
[1:54:24] that high priest would sound out in that
[1:54:26] sounding of the high priest was to let
[1:54:28] him know you can go free
[1:54:31] the sounding of our high priest the holy
[1:54:33] spirit he ascended on high and sent back
[1:54:37] the holy spirit and the holy spirit same

[1:54:56] sounding out what is it it's the high
[1:54:58] priest it's melchizedek it's the living
[1:55:01] god who's right in our midst

[1:55:06] through our lives you see it isn't even
[1:55:08] going as you stand before people on your
[1:55:10] job it isn't that you've got to explain
[1:55:13] all the scriptures but there's a
[1:55:14] sounding that goes out of your life the
[1:55:17] same holy spirit the same life that was
[1:55:20] in that blood cell when that blood cell

[1:55:39] that is touched by the feeling of our
[1:55:41] infirmities
[1:55:42] let me just let me just close it here
[1:55:47] no doubt we could re i could we could
[1:55:48] have
[1:55:49] lift up hands and say
[1:55:51] how many times where you've either
[1:55:52] walked in here
[1:55:54] maybe even when you've no doubt you've
[1:55:56] listened to
[1:55:58] a message
[1:55:59] well here you come
[1:56:01] and the spirit of god
[1:56:03] would move right down
[1:56:05] it doesn't matter if it's brother samuel
[1:56:06] who it is
[1:56:08] but god will move right down and he
[1:56:09] he'll minister right to your heart
[1:56:12] and it's a need that's in your life
[1:56:15] it's a need that maybe you didn't write
[1:56:17] it down for something for people to pray
[1:56:18] for because maybe it isn't something
[1:56:19] that you would want wrote down it's just
[1:56:21] something you've got in your heart you
[1:56:23] say lord i i've got a need
[1:56:26] when you begin to place that before him
[1:56:29] he is the high priest who's touched
[1:56:33] moved by the feeling of your infirmities
[1:56:36] we're not setting here today because in
[1:56:38] our own selves we're a bunch of strong
[1:56:40] people
[1:56:42] we're not sitting here today because
[1:56:43] we're saying man you know what i got it
[1:56:44] all made i've got it all under control i
[1:56:47] know
[1:56:47] if you do you you you need a real change
[1:56:51] because one thing you realize the closer
[1:56:53] we get to him the more like him we
[1:56:55] recognize more and more
[1:56:57] yeah i don't got it in control
[1:57:00] he's got it in control he's got me in
[1:57:02] control and lord i want you to be in
[1:57:04] full control
[1:57:07] and he'll come right by through his word
[1:57:10] he'll ride right up to our life and
[1:57:12] he'll take that word and begin to sound
[1:57:15] out to our lives why
[1:57:17] he's the high priest
[1:57:18] who's touched
[1:57:20] he's moved god is
[1:57:22] moved by ministering
[1:57:25] to our needs
[1:57:28] your sickness
[1:57:29] your trial
[1:57:30] your discouragement
[1:57:33] need of the holy ghost whatever it is
[1:57:35] every redemptive blessing it's met in
[1:57:37] him so no matter what it is when you
[1:57:39] begin to just put that before god and
[1:57:42] just begin to look to god he's moved god
[1:57:45] will take a man
[1:57:47] and move him in a channel to speak to
[1:57:51] your need
[1:57:52] it's not the man
[1:57:54] it's god
[1:57:55] it's god coming and ministering to our
[1:57:58] needs
[1:57:59] he's a high priest that can be touched
[1:58:03] by the feeling of our infirmity you come
[1:58:05] right where we're at
[1:58:07] brother branham
[1:58:08] would say it even just like this
[1:58:12] what we he can only
[1:58:14] intercede on what we confess
[1:58:17] that he is
[1:58:20] see god will come right here in the
[1:58:21] service just in a gathering that we have
[1:58:23] right here god can come right to your
[1:58:25] need and maybe you've got a need
[1:58:27] you're a little discouraged he'll come
[1:58:29] right to where you're at and he'll begin
[1:58:31] to speak to your heart to encourage you
[1:58:35] god will come to another one maybe
[1:58:37] they're in need of salvation he'll come
[1:58:38] right and minister right to their need
[1:58:41] but as god comes and moves throughout
[1:58:43] the diversity throughout of all the
[1:58:45] needs that we have here the greatest
[1:58:47] thing that we could do
[1:58:49] is to take the word
[1:58:51] that he's inspiring to our hearts that's
[1:58:53] letting us know
[1:58:55] he knows about me
[1:58:57] this is god right here this is god

[1:59:01] standing right in my heart the greatest
[1:59:03] thing that we can do is say lord jesus
