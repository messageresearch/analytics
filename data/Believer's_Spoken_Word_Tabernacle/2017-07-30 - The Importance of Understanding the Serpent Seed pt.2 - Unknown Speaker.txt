Heavenly Father thankful Lord this opportunity to be here this morning Lord and gather with your people and I thank you Lord It's a privilege Lord to speak before these people Lord Lord I I enjoy myself when I preach more and I but I pray God you'll anoint me this morning dear God for my desire dear Lord is to please you and be a help to your people Lord and I pray dear God that you Lord will anoint the ears of the year of your God pray dear God that made everyone in every Spirit In This Place comes subject to the Holy Spirit May there be a liberty and a freedom of your word coming forth I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen if you could stand with me I'd like to read from Genesis chapter 3 verses 14 and 15. we were speaking Thursday night on the importance of understanding serpent seed and I want to continue with that thought Genesis chapter 3 verse 14. and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between Thee the woman between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel may be seated if you can just hold on to your Bibles for a moment there's a couple of scriptures I want to go to here but the reason I read this for a text to start out is because you can see that God mentions the serpent having a seed so to me that's the very first thing for understanding the serpent Siege is that God mentioned it had a seed so the uh phrase of serpent seed is not just something that's been concocted by a man it's right here in the scripture and so if it's in the scriptures then there's a truth to it amen now if it had been fruit in the garden that caused the fog then God would have been cursed in the tree like he did the Fig Tree and through Jesus Christ when it didn't yield for figs when it was supposed to but he didn't curse the tree he didn't curse fruit you didn't curse those things he cursed the serpent and said that it had a seed but he also said the woman would have a seed now I want to turn to Genesis chapter 4. and I want to look at the character of Cain because we want to see who's Kane's Daddy and we want to see what seed he is of because we've said here by the scripture there's two seeds so which seed was cane of and we can see this by his character verse 3. through nine in the process of time it came to pass that came brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought up the first knees of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto ab1 to his offering then decaying into his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto the Cain why thou Roth why is that countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper now this is showing the character of Cain was a murderer I've done some studying on different uh what you want to call them disorders within people and things and one of the things that that I found to be equal across the board is that people don't just turn 50 and all of a sudden become a murderer people don't just turn 50 and all of a sudden become a child molester there's seeds that were back there already in their character already in their person and Cain was a murderer and that's why I killed his brother he turned out in character like his father a bringer of death a murderer his utter Defiance of God when faced by the Almighty in Genesis four and five and six 9 and 13 14. show him to be absolutely unhuman like in characteristics seeming even to surpass any account we have in the scriptures concerning a confrontation of Satan by God turn with me to verse John chapter 3. first John chapter 3 verse 12. and it says not as king who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and War for slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous so it said Cain was of the wicked one now turns me to Luke chapter 3. verse 38. it says which was the son of Enos which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God so who's Cain's father it was the Wicked one and Abraham is called the son of God so he can't beat Cain's father because it was the Wicked one that was his father to me it's so clearly in the scriptures that you'd have to not believe the Bible to not believe servancy now if it hadn't been opened to somebody I don't look down on them but I take all opportunity I can to try to slip these things in there um I guess everyone maybe has their different ways of of testifying to people and trying to reach people mine is a little more subtle I don't Hammer them right in the face I uh I I try to watch for doors to open and slip things in and try to slip some questions to them to get them to think in Genesis 3 Adam called his wife's name Eve he said because she was the mother of all living nowhere in the scriptures does it ever say that Adam was the father of all living so I think by this we can see where the serpent seed started who's father who was the father of Cain now if you turns me to Romans chapter 9. and I want to take a look at the election Romans chapter 9 verse 10. through 14. not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated that's referring to Malachi chapter 1 verses 2 and 3. what shalt thou say then is there unrighteousness with God in Malachi he says the people question God worry and has thou loved us God's love is elective the proof of his love is not that you don't face trials or not that you don't face suffering but the proof of his love is that he elected you he called you now why did he do that Because of Who You Are you're the children of God you're from the lineage of Adam not from the lineage of the serpent ER he chose you to Salvation and that's proof of his love I like that song it says he didn't have to open my eyes he could have easily passed me by for the age I was living in was wretched poor and blind but then I heard recognizing your day serpent seed [Music] Hallelujah foreknowledge that's how that God elects um and the Adam and his seat after him brother Brown says now if he's infinite by his foreknowledge he knew who would come to him and who would not come to him he knew who would be saved and who would not be saved that certainly would clear up Romans 8 and 9 for you if there's any question about whether he calls his children by election or not for Paul's speaking of Esau and Jacob before either child was born not even knowing what was right from or wrong God said I love Jacob and I hate Esau before either child even had a way to make a choice but God knew from the beginning what Esau was he knew what Jacob was and God knowed in the beginning what you were and what you are not so therefore he cannot be nothing but what you we cannot be nothing but what he made us if we could be like somebody else let's just be what God made us that's all we can do and the faith of Abraham he says predestination is a hard word among the congregation of people because predestination really foreknowledge is a better word and predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks on to Destiny now the reason I chose this topic of the importance of understanding serpent seed is that without understanding that you can't understand predestination and there are there are people within different religions that don't believe in predestination even though it's in the Bible it said he predestinated us but they stumble at it because they say how could God do that because everyone has should have a choice for God to be just everyone does have a choice but God being infinite knows what they will choose thank you and knowing what they would choose those that he knew would choose him he makes a way of redemption for them and because he knows then he can already your destination has already been determined I I'll be coming back up here this next coming month for a little while and toward the end of the month I plan to to bring my wife Mina up so she can be here to see her mom and then she can help me drive back home when we go back home but I I went online and I bought her a ticket because I knew she was going to come so I bought her a ticket now heard her destination is Cleveland Ohio and God your ticket has already been bought when you were sealed by the Holy Ghost of promise that right there shows your tickets already been bought and your destination has already been set we can begin to look up on the board of the signs of time and see when our departure is coming for knowledge he looks to Destiny let God be an infinite in the beginning knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what people would do so he could foretell what would take place for he knew what would be therefore before Esau and Jacob Peter was born God said Esau have I hated Jacob have I loved because he foreknew what they could be he never made Esau the way that he was he wasn't willing that Esau would be that way but Esau by choice was that way and God knew would take that that he would take that weight so that's how he knows us today he knows your heart you might be able to fool your neighbor you might be able to fool your pastor but you'll never be able to fool God because he knows your heart therefore he by election he chose Abraham for he knew what Abraham would do you remember when he called him out there and he said he'd not keep a thing secret from him and when he was going down to destroy Sodom in the morning he says for I know that Abraham will teach his children I know it God himself I know that Abraham will send this message down from one to the other generation but God for knowing that and knowing that Abraham would do it then he told Abraham the beginning that he would save him and save his seat after him and would give him an unconditional Covenant that he made with Abraham not because Abraham was good but because God was good hallelujah it's called because you and I were good because we're not and we weren't it's because God is good now brother Branham in this message South African testimony he speaks he speaks about his ministry and there was a reason I wanted to include this quote uh it's right here toward the end of it but brother random says here's what I am to you by Sovereign Grace before there was a world God knew I would be here and have this ministry how many believes that sure he does then it was sent to you people I'm glad to see you Full Gospel people believe in election because that's where the whole thing lies is in election that's right in election God chose that nothing we could do God has done well then me to you is a sign of the Lord Jesus Christ so he's saying him his ministry to the people is a sign of the Lord Jesus Christ like a pastor or any other Pastor when they preach the gospel see them anointed by the Holy Spirit that's a sign to you so God ain't left us without a sign when you see the anointed preaching of your pastor that is a sign to you amen God knew before the foundation of the world that we'd have this service on this day and he knew who would be here they knew who wouldn't be here he knew who would have already went on to Glory by this time and Jeremiah 1 and 5. the Lord says before I form thee in the belly I knew thee before thou camest out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations so this is before that he was ever formed in his mother's womb not just before he was born but before he was ever even formed in his mother's womb God knew him you can say the same about yourself before you ever formed in the womb of your mother God knew you why because he knew you in himself you are the manifested thoughts of God for this day and age John the Baptist 712 years before he was born he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness said Isaiah is that true understand 712 years before he was born Isaiah said it's the voice of one crying in the wilderness Jeremiah God told Jeremiah before you were ever formed in your mother's womb I knew you and Sanctified you and ordained you to be a prophet over the Nations before he was ever formed from his mother's womb Moses and many others foreign by God by the foreknowledge of God and that's the only way I can expect any to understand being to the people who come and see it here now the Bible says Jesus says no man can come to me except the father draws him first so man don't seek God brother Branham says God calls Man by election for knowledge of God like when Jesus Christ when he was born he was the son of God he couldn't help because he was the son of God he was for ordained the Son of God before the world began he was the son of God and he was the woman's seed from the Garden of Eden that was to be to bruise the Serpent's head and he had nothing to do with it it was already planned out so if God had before the foundation weren't already planned out Redemption had already planned out how Jesus his son would come then God has already planned out how you would come to me you have the color of eyes you have because God created you to have that color of eyes say why would God care about the color of eyes I recall I believe it was a little blind girl come up before brother Branham she didn't have no eyes brother Brandon prayed for her that God would give her eyes and then before she went to walk away he said I forgot to ask you what color do you want what a creator what a creative Hallelujah [Applause] he created you to be what you are Hallelujah and you know what is the Glorious thing about it is it's got nothing to do with you God knows what you're going to choose and then God chooses you but then us in our human nature that Fallen nature it doesn't matter nothing about that nature that nature is going to die and you're going to receive a new nature but it doesn't matter how you in that worldly nature would try to get away from God you won't be able to do it why because he has four ordained you why because he knows that over top of everything that tries to stop you in the end you will choose him [Applause] you got saved because God chose you before the foundation of the world to be saved that's the scripture teaching now you see we begin to find out it's not us it's him he chose us now listen to this is in Jehovah Jireh can you see healing is yours salvation is yours it's a free gift of God that God gave you and called you and chose you before the foundation of the world he chose you you're his Heir why he watches over you day and night trying to get to you to do something for you he watches over his day and night why just wanting to do something for us you say well brother Branham I've made mistakes last week or last month I don't care how many mistakes you make we've all sinned and come short of the glory if you're now listen to this if you're a child of Abraham you're ready to recognize that as Sin and come back to God again and God's mercy still hangs to you Hallelujah I don't know about you but that makes me happy because I am a man that's full of mistakes so it makes me happy to know that God's Mercy is still there for me for all you perfect ones will God bless you together turns me to Matthew chapter 10 verse 2 through 4. now the names of the 12 apostles are these the first Simon who is called Peter and Andrew is brother and James the son of Zebedee and John his brother Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the Publican James the son of I don't know how to pronounce that and labius whose surname was Thaddeus Simon the Canaanite and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him so Judas was one of the twelve and Jesus says that the father gave Judas to him now how is that well Cain was given into the hands of Adam Cain was without excuse he was raised by the same parents that raised Abel hmm Judas had opportunity he had choice received Church by the word world where the REM says they were in the upper chamber all with one Accord and all the world had drained out of them and they were emptied up and the Holy Ghost came today they say come join the church put your name on a book and bow down and say I confess Christ as the son of God the devil does the same thing certainly the devil was baptized when Judas was baptized the devil went out and preached the gospel when Judas went out and preached the gospel but the devil didn't get the Holy Ghost so Judas was right with them up until the end and he was absent from the upper room why because he had already made his choice prior to that in Jude one in four it says for there are certain men crept and unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lavishness and denying the only Lord God in our Lord Jesus Christ so God knowing what they would be could foreordain them to condemnation these men of old foreign to condemnation is that right man for ordained too old to this condemnation like Pharaoh in Egypt Judas Iscariot born the son of perdition in second Peter 3 and 7 it says but the heavens and earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and Perdition of ungodly men so there's something reserved for those that don't choose God doesn't send anyone to hell they go there by choice everyone has a choice there are people who don't understand predestination they say how could you have a choice and God predestinates some people to be lost God knows what they'll choose he knows they'll choose to stay lost he knows what they'll choose over top of him God knows people will choose religion look Cain's lineage became religious they built cities they built churches Cain was religious God knows that there will be people who will choose religion over top of him over top of his word Jesus said while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gave us me I kept and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled the Bible tells us that God raised up pharaoh and hardened Pharaoh's heart God knew what choices Pharaoh would make so God used pharaoh to bring about his fulfillment of his word he had told Abraham your children will go into will be in bondage 400 years and then I will bring them out by a mighty hand and God allowed Pharaoh's heart to become hardened just like when Ahab and Jehoshaphat sat there and God said looking down what can we do to bring about the Fulfillment of the words of Elijah and it says that a lying Spirit came up out of hell and said I'll go down and be a lying Spirit within the mouse of His prophets and God allowed it God raised up Judas Iscariot he was born here the Son of Perdition God told Esau on Jacob before they were ever born told his mother all about what was going to take place one he'd hate and the other he would had love is that true so it's God who does all things in all things you have nothing to do with it and if God called you the love of God is ringing in your heart and all that he has called will come to him none of will be lost God's promise he said none of them would be lost all the fathers give me will come to me and none of them is lost but Judas Iscariot that the scriptures might be fulfilled and I'll raise them up at the last day again earnestly continue for the faith he says here was the son of God come down from the ivory palaces of God made flesh and dwelt Among Us and here's Judas the Son of Perdition he come from hell and returning back to hell here's God in flesh come from Heaven returning back to heaven if you ask me God's more than just when he would allow someone who come from Hell still to have a choice but he had to because he allowed in the beginning he allowed Lucifer to have a choice he allowed the angels to have a choice and there was angels that chose to follow Lucifer and those that chose to stay with Michael thank you the faith of Abraham he said you see Cain who was inspired by his daddy Satan which we know was in he was inspired by Satan he was the first murderer the first liar and he killed his brother Judas Iscariot in a pre-figure exactly as Judas killed Jesus At The Cross Cain killed Abel at the cross of sacrifice perfectly so here he's showing the connection between Cain and Judas that are of the same seed it would be so close that it would deceive the very elective possible the serpent seed got in among the twelve and stayed right with them right up until before them going to the upper room thank you Hallelujah Romans 8 29 30. for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brother moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called damn he also Justified in whom he justified them he also glorified this is already a finished work we look many times at ourselves a mental picture of ourselves our life and there's times we look at it and say and we don't say oh I'm I believe I'm in the image of God by what I'm seeing many times we can become discouraged Satan is accuser of the brother points at every fault failure and mistake but this says we will be conformed to the image of his son it's not something that you've got to do it's something he's doing in whom he did predestinate he then he called who he called he justified who he justified them he glorified Hallelujah turn me to Ephesians chapter 1 verses 3 through 14. blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinate us unto adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through the blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we're in Heath abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation heard the word of Truth we were ordained to hear the word of Truth in this last day in the midst of all criticism of this message in the midst of all the people that come in amongst us and have left and have decided to try to find fault and to criticize here's what I say they were not ordained to see it just as Judas is scary it was not ordained to get the Holy Ghost they were not ordained to be sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise Jesus said things at times intentionally to make people stumble except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you and he never explained it and can you imagine carnal Minds eating his flesh and drinking his blood what in the world this is a Madman and he didn't explain it and the Bible says many left him over that scene that's right and then when they left he turned to his disciples said will you go also Peter always ready to speak up he said Lord where can we go thou alone has the words of life somebody could have poked Peter and said Peter what did he mean by that Peter said I have no idea when he said if you tear this Temple down I'll raise it up again in three days the disciples were looking around at that Temple just like everybody else well I don't know if he says he can do it I believe it they didn't understand it wasn't until later these understandings come to them when did it come to them to understand what he meant by he would raise it up again in three days when he raised from the dead and appeared to them [Applause] you say how I got questions brother how am I going to know this message to write or not we'll wait around to the Rapture time see who leaves and who stays me I'm going to believe because I'm leaving [Applause] I like that song This Old House I'm living in it's needing repair and I gotta leave it on my mind because he's already prepared another house for me it was not made with hands I'm telling friends there is so many things in this Bible that just causes the real True Believer to rejoice when they hear it verse 13 in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance how do you know how do we know that we're going to inherit because he gave us the earnest the down payment the ceiling of the Holy Ghost I'm going to tell you something friends God always vindicates his word and that is important to recognize when God does vindicate something which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory I tell you what I'm waiting for the Redemption of the purchased possession my soul's already in the redeemed state but my body isn't it and I'm looking for that new body I'm looking forward to having lay off this spirit and have an A theophany I don't like this human spirit oh he gave us a new spirit just like the Bible says because Madam said if he hadn't you wouldn't be able to get along with yourself the scripture says he would give us a new spirit and he has but it still has memory and conscience and reasoning and Imagination it still has those things and that is the area where the devil attacks you at this word did not come to us by reasoning neither has the end time message came to us through reasoning so you're not going to understand it by reasoning we were talking the other day and we were talking about science to science they recognize your brain as being you because it's the control center of the body so when the brain dies they look at that as you dying but we know there's a soul and that soul is what is you now this body of course needs all these different other things to function as a body here on Earth but who you are is that soul so when the body is dead the brain is dead where are you the soul is gone here almost a month ago my mom and I my brother stood by my dad's bedside and they told us the part of his brain that causes heart to beat the causes his his uh lungs to function and to breathe and said that part's gone and they said when we unplug these machines from him everything's going to stop we stood there they walked out and give us time we stood there and we talked among ourselves and said he's already gone there ain't no sense to keeping the machine on him he's already gone we can't bring him back I I wouldn't have wanted to bring him back he wouldn't have wanted to come back the adoption message brother random says what is the Holy Ghost now then I'll read the rest of it real fast if you'll bear with me much where was we at the other night brother Mike where they were all happy oh everything was peace that was perfect love now every time you come this way you drop down a little drop every time you make a step you come inches closer when it gets down to the Earth he's talking about from the holy ghost coming down this way he said you got a shadow of the shadow of the shadow of Shadows now that's how much Holy Ghost you got in you but you thirst for something or I would not oh would not people like old people how would I like to go back and be 15 again or 20. well I'd give anything what good would it do me I might be 15 and yet die tonight it's uncertain what if he was 15 tonight how do you know whether your mother would be living when you get home or not how do you know you're going to get home how do you know you're going to be living tomorrow if you're 12 years old perfect health you may be killed in an accident drop dead anything might happen to you uncertain there's nothing here certain but you long for that what is it it's that up there making you long for it it's that up there making you long for it what are we longing for we're longing to be changed we're longing to meet Jesus that's what all this is about redemption's one of the oldest things in the Bible did you know the Plan of Redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of it God foreseen and making a way of redemption before he even made the world where the Bible plainly says that Christ was predestinated for ordained and was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world is that right why before the world was made God had a Plan of Redemption says in Israel and the church says you are saved by grace election God's foreknowledge predestination for ordination Paul tells the church in Ephesus that God predestinated us in Christ before the foundation of the world think of it predestinated us in Christ before the foundation of world what are we worried about then get away from worry we're just the happiest creatures you could ever sing my how can you believe that and keep from being happy we should be happy get away from worry see Satan wants you to worry well everybody around me boys just really having a good time and they're all going I wonder if I'm going to make it right well just let me give you this encouragement you're not the only one that Satan comes and tells that to you you see Satan's a god a problem he doesn't know who belongs to him or not he doesn't know who's God's children because he don't know who his own children are Satan doesn't know what people will choose he doesn't have foreknowledge Satan is he is reactive he reacts to What You Do by what he puts in your path you could not scientifically dissect an individual and find that seed of God because it's an invisible seed just like God's invisible but God became visible through the expression of his word in Jesus Christ you are the visible manifestation or expression of his seed God as God made himself visible through Jesus Christ so he makes his seed that is in you become visible through an expression in your life that you are the children of God God knew what Esau would do he knew what Jacob would do God didn't push them and he didn't beg them either one of them they had a choice God doesn't come down and beg his seed to conform to his word they just conformed to his word because they are his seed because you are the seed of God you see what these services are about I'm not trying to actually prove to you serpent seed I believe I'm speaking to people who already believe it but by taking that I'm trying to show you predestination and what it is and to also show you who you are what seed line you're of because you see there's two seed lines and that's where Satan attacks you many times trying to tell you you you're not from the sea lion of God but the expression in your life the manifestation of you proves what you are not your mistakes but remember brother Branham said it because God chose you it shows you who you are why because he knew who you are what you would be what you would choose God knows his own children and they know his voice and a stranger they will not follow there's a lot of strangers out there that have got a lot of negative things to say but I don't care to hear or hear them in the days of Jesus there was a lot of folks that had negative things to say about Jesus but Peter and James and John didn't care to hear what they had to say [Applause] thank you not not everybody around him believed that he was the son of God sends the word across your path and you respond to it because you are his seed just like that story about the eagle in the chicken yard legally and that mother Eagle went flying over began to scream how many's ever been around chickens they scratch and scratch and scratch and scratch you know for food they pick and they and they make you know uh little noises but have you ever heard a chicken scream nope that's not a sound they make and so a little eaglet he was there it sounds he was making wasn't matching up with the sounds that were around him there was something that he couldn't put his put his foot on why he was different but when that eagle flew over and screamed then he responded back why because he was an eagle and when he heard the scream of that mother Eagle it's something to him responded back and he screamed the chickens ran for safety you know chickens got their eyes you know on the sides of their head something flies over there and they'll scatter but not that little eaglet there was something in him that identified with that and when we heard this message there was something in us that identified with it when we heard the truth of this hour now you might have heard maybe some other religion before this but somehow you just couldn't fit in there was something different you long for more than what the rest were satisfied with he wanted something more than that Hallelujah Duncan say I know what my sons and daughters will do how they'll Act what kind of men and women they'll be because they are my children for knowledge before man fell what we just read before man fell God had already made a way of redemption God is not in modern terms God is not reactive he's proactive amen we got nothing to be worried about am I going to make the Rapture certainly you're going to make the rapture [Applause] say how do you know brother Jerry because that's what's on your ticket [Applause] to think of brother Dan
