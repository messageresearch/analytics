hands down don't want no more Fellowship so hands up saying okay good all right so Lord willing uh I think what we're going to do is try to start that that fire pit we're not going to go all night with that it's just try to you know have a few hours there but Lord willing about 5 30 6. um I know for some of you it'll start at 5 30. for the rest of us it'll start at six you know just to make sure you're there but 536 will have the fire going but one thing we want to make you aware of please bring your lawn chairs and just so you know brother Willy's still looking for his hahaha so brother Willie's coming tonight to do inspections but I do have a lawn chair back there that somebody left and I just put it in my office just in the closet I don't use it but I put it in the closet because I thought you know it's it'll be fire pits next year and everything so make sure you bring your lawn chairs and uh everything if we um also if you have some extra firewood we have firewood there but feel free to bring some because whatever we don't use for this evening we definitely will be having more of the fire pit fellowships throughout the um the summer and then into the fall and I think that's a it's been a real great time a good blessing and things like that so um but I I want to just also go on to say I just how many have so appreciated the word of the Lord has come forth this weekend and just so appreciate brother Nathan just yielding to the Lord and you know and and what has what started out as one part and you watched how the Holy Spirit just begin to take a hold in that service and I'm glad what I'm thankful for is lives and hearts that just be obedient to the Lord know there's some times where you come into a meeting and there's times where even sometimes where I've come into a meeting and I know it's kind of an arrest where I kind of think what God has a direction to go in you're kind of resting in that and then there's times where I've had things that all of a sudden I have to just start putting down notes and then things get extended here and there and but it's just what's wonderful I appreciate the minding the mind of the Lord because God knows what we need God knows what we need and I'll tell you what God has has just been so wonderful to us already and I'm of expectation here this morning amen God's going to do something very very special right here this morning and it's the way God comes it isn't in Breaking great big lights and flashing and things but God comes by way of his word and He makes himself known and there are things right while the word is coming forth that transpires you don't have to wait till the end but right while the words coming receive the word and the word will take an effect within your heart and in your life and just be obedient to the Lord God moves on your heart in the service and you want prayer at the end of the service we'd be happy to pray for you but we just want to let go and let God have his way this morning just pull on the gift of God God knows what we have need of and so I want to say to brother Nathan as he'd make his way forward and to he and sister Rebecca and we appreciate sister Rebecca amen and the family being here here and we just really appreciate them and I appreciate you know we appreciate good friends and we had just thank God that our paths not only have crossed but the friendship and I just I love that and love the brother brother Nathan love his ministry and uh so if we could let's just stand and you got a song on your heart okay amen [Music] according to yours according to your promises I can stand secure right upon my heart the truth that says [Music] according to the world [Music] like to welcome the visitors amen sister Doris Mr stranger God bless you it's good to see you this morning amen good to have you over here also here with us amen you and your wife God bless you and man good to have you here with us amen [Music] according to your words according to your promises [Music] the truth that sets me free according to your world [Music] according to your world [Music] praise the Lord amen you know where the brand talks about a man named Zacharias there that the angel came and told him said Joel you'll have a child in his old age him and his wife and he couldn't understand that said so the angel said well you'll be you'll be dumb for the space of the pregnancy here and it's I think we'd be better off sometimes if God would just shut our mouths yeah like he did Zacharias there and brother M said he had all kinds of examples in the Bible of people that were Barren that had children and but then the angel came and told a young virgin said you're going to conceive not knowing a man she said be it unto me according to that word she didn't have one example in the Bible to go off of but she did have one verse that said it was going to happen and she said be it unto me according to Thy word so I pray that's our prayer this morning be it unto me whatever his word says Lord just be it unto me brother Nathan can you figure it all out no but just be it unto me how's it going to be when's it going to be I don't know but just be it unto me according to that word brother Sammy was talking about how he appreciated good friends and he has certainly become a good friend you know I have a tendency to get myself in trouble and speak when I should be silent and he has a tendency to be silent when he should speak so [Laughter] we uh we we've got to know each other I I need to start asking myself now what would brother Samuel do and it'll keep me out of trouble and then then he needs to ask well now what would brother Nathan do in this situation maybe he'll get in more trouble and I'll get in less that way but you know brother Willie I am not a detective but if I were you I would check brother Samuel's closet praise the Lord let's turn to Malachi this morning Malachi chapter 1. and uh look into the word this morning did that connect back there all right yeah Malachi chapter one and I am I was sitting there at the at a picnic table yesterday with some of the brothers fellowshipping and and they began to go down some paths with some conversations and things and the Lord was already beginning to deal with me a little bit for the service this morning and and I thought I I've just got to sit here and keep my mouth shutter I'm going to preach tomorrow's sermon and I asked myself what would brother Samuel do so I just and uh I'm learning brother I'm learning and so I uh I went back to the hotel yesterday afternoons began to study a little bit and and the Lord led me down a path and and um then went back over and had some more fellowship and Sister Kim said oh I think you should just keep going and she said that's been so good and so I didn't tell her last night but we're going to look at God's choice part three this morning so amen I had something in mind early on when brother Samuel invited me and a sermon that I'd preached a while back at at church and up in Canada last year and and I thought maybe I'd preached that this weekend just didn't seem like I could get to it but but the way this this sermon has went and the way the notes are today I actually borrowed a few of those notes so we'll get a little bit of it in anyhow but Malachi chapter 1 and verse 1. the burden of of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau I loved Jacob and I hated Esau so we want to look at this again this morning with the help of the Lord I'm God's choice and let's just bow our heads together this morning Heavenly Father Lord truly we are thankful Lord for your guidance for your lord the wisdom that you impart to each and every one of us for our daily needs and for the direction of Our Lives we're thankful for your word we're thankful for your promises Lord because we know that they are yea and amen and that anything that you say and anything that you do is perfect Lord we're we're imperfect in ourselves Lord but we serve a perfect God and so I pray that you would just have preeminence in this service this morning I pray you would get me out of the way so that you can speak something that would be of help I pray Lord that you would blessed this congregation bless the pastor Lord bless every musician every song leader every Deacon every trustee every Sunday school teacher Lord each part of the laity each member of the body Lord those that help so Faithfully yesterday and each one that has a part those that support with their tithes and their offerings and their prayers and their attendance Lord we're so thankful for churches like this that are standing for truth in this dark hour and Lord no doubt the enemy Lord how he loves to come against as your Prophet said the word didn't say that the gates of hell wouldn't be against the church but it said that they wouldn't prevail so we believe that's true for this local assembly as well Lord that the Gates of Hell May hate a work like this but yet it won't be able to Prevail because you're faithful and you're true Lord and there's promises in your word that says we're Overcomers and so we're thankful that there will be Overcomers in this age and Lord we just Commit This service to you and and for the outcome Lord we pray that it'll be a help and a blessing and an encouragement we love you Lord and we thank you for all that you do in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you richly you can be seated certainly appreciate brother Samuel's friendship and his invitation to be here and we certainly enjoyed his ministry last Labor Day weekend and and looking forward to it again this coming Labor Day Lord will willing and and appreciate his ministry and to stand for the word and all that God is doing here you know when we when we look back through history and we look at the scriptures we look at some of these characters of the Bible that we looked at over the last few Services no doubt in our mind there are many that we love to meet as I was talking about yesterday about how brother Branham said he'd love to shake uriah's hand for me I if you want to go to the Old Testament I I want to meet David if you go to the New Testament I I want to I want to meet Paul if you go to the church ages I want to meet brother Branham there there are ones that I want to eat most of all I want to see the Lord Jesus but there are characters that stand out to us that that you know this we uh something we connect with there whatever it be and so there's ones that I long to meet and and we look at it like that and maybe it's somebody different for you maybe for some of the sisters it's Ruth or Esther or Deborah or maybe Mary or different ones in the scriptures there that you'd like to meet and maybe for some of the brothers you know maybe for some of our bodybuilders it's Sam Center you know whoever whoever it is that you you look up to in the scripture I wasn't pointing fingers brother brother Sammy fingers over here I wasn't pointing things maybe maybe you know whoever it is that you uh you want to meet in the Bible but you know I believe that they're over there looking down into this age sir and to see the darkest age that has ever been wickedness yeah spiritual wickedness in high places and we'll get over there and we'll want to hear how David overcame and how jephthah and and how Gideon and and different ones how they overcame and and they'll say now wait a minute aren't you from laodicea aren't she from down there and in the darkest most evil age that ever was we want to hear your testimony how on Earth did you ever make it it's hard for us to to look at it like that because you know we can't go back in the pages of the Bible maybe and find our name and our story because it's still being written but just as those men were Overcomers in their age there has to be Overcomers in this age and so yeah so I I'm afraid many times we take that for granted and we we Look Backwards or we look forwards but we fail to recognize what God is doing right now Romans chapter 9 and verse 11 we want to look at this what uh what Malachi was referring to here we want to look at it a little further this morning for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated now notice Paul's saying here that children not being born yet and not having even done any good or evil but that the purpose of God according to election would stand God could look down through time and he would say Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated now you don't understand predestination by foreknowledge and the election and the calling of God then you look at statements like this and if you're not careful you begin to think well that is so unfair of God here here these men hadn't even been born they hadn't done any good or any bad to be judged by and yet God already made his choice but yet if you understand election then you're very thankful for this type of scripture you see a man like Jacob would be so thankful for election because God can look down before there was a Jacob and love him a man like Esau says now that's not fair God I hadn't even done anything yet but God by foreknowledge God didn't just go down through time and say eeny meeny miny moe and and go back and forth I'll take this and I won't take that one and I like this I don't like that one but God by foreknowledge could see the end from the beginning he knew what she would do he knew what your actions would be he knew that she would be sitting here this morning he knew what your name would be 300 years ago before your great great grandparents ever knew what their children's name would be he knew what your name would be he knew when you would come to the Earth he knew what color eyes you would have what color hair you would have who your parents would be who your grandparents would be he could look down through time and see by predestination and foreknowledge all of these things that's why in the Garden of Eden when Adam fell it didn't shock God God knew that was going to take place when Judas betrayed Jesus it didn't shock Jesus Jesus knew that the Betrayal was coming because he knew all things and so God looks at things differently than you and I do and we get so worried we we go through something like this pandemic that we just came through of coven and if we're not careful fear begins to creep in and grip the people they begin to be afraid and begin to worry to be upset but God has already looked down through time God knows what my end will be there was a man in the Civil War a general by the name of Stonewall Jackson and they called him Stonewall because he'd stand right out there on the battlefield on his horse and and and bullets and cannonballs be flying all around him and he'd just stand there like a stone wall and they asked him one time and said how can you do that he said God has predetermined the time of my departure and he said so I am just as safe on the battlefield as I am in my own bed God knows all about us God could look back through I almost forgot to share this testimony I was going to share this weekend but God brought it right back around so God knows what he's doing and you know God can look back at the time and he can look forward through time and God knew hey there are people who their lineage was snuffed out because the last man in the family was killed in a war or was killed in a plague and we've come through ages of Dark Ages and we've come through ages of plagues and of famines and of wars and great turmoil and yet somehow you got here even though maybe you had a great great granddaddy in World War one or a grandfather in World War II or a daddy that was maybe in in the Korean war or in Vietnam or something like that and maybe men falling to the left of them and to the right of them maybe they went through all kinds of sickness and pandemics and things if you trace your lineage back maybe you had people back there in the days of the plagues and things like that and and when there were thousands upon thousands dying over in Europe maybe in their own village and yet they would survive why because God had a predestinated seed that he had looked down down through time and he knew you would be here this morning and then we get a little scared well what about this and what about that we've got a sister in our church one of one of my deacons wives that not one of his wives like he has many wives but my Deacon one of my deacons has a wife that you got to be careful how you word things or people begin to add their own interpretation to it but he uh the sister her dad lived in Germany during the time of World War II and and he was a Jewish young man about 11 or 12 years old and and he was taken and placed into one of the prison camps there and he would see them take people into the gas Chambers and and would see people by the thousands being killed and and and one day he would he would see them gathering together a big group of people and that he was there with and and he just felt to hand supernaturally pick him up and place him on the other side of the fence and he looked around to see who it was that had done that and there was nobody there but separated him from that group of people that was being taken to the gas chamber and another time a man met him over by a fence on the exterior perimeter there and it was a farmer that would bring in supplies and produce and things and he said listen I've got word that they're going to kill a bunch of you all tomorrow but if you can meet me at this certain gate I'll smuggle you out of here and I'll get you across the border into another country and he got out and escaped when there were others of his relatives and things that died during that time but God protected and preserved that line because there was a sister that was predestinated to receive the message in this age that had to be here [Applause] and maybe thousands dying to the left of him and thousands dying to the right but yet she's there she survived her lineage was preserved and and we can't figure those things out when we think about eternity and things like that it's enough to our little human Minds can't comprehend it all but God can look down at their eternity and knows what will be and knows what will take place and Satan has maybe been after you since the very time of your birth yet we find that he wasn't able to Snuff out your life because God had a plan for you maybe he's tried to discourage him maybe he's tried to destroy you maybe he's tried to sap your Victory and he's trying to keep you pushed down but yet somehow that predestinated seed you can bury it under semen or whatever it'd be it'll find a way out and said you core you pour cement over a seed and he said you watched around the edges of it it'll begin to come out and begin to find light so I believe that's how it is by the predestinated of God brother man said that man went out on a Jeep ride after there had been all kinds of bombs and things in the war there and he said he was looking around just Devastation everywhere and he picked up a rock and under that rock was a little flower hey man oh hide me in the cleft of the rock Jehovah we have a brother from our church that's a deacon brother brother uh brother Samuel knows him very well from from byc in different places Brother David Hoover and his dad was a Pentecostal preacher that that knew brother Branham his name was L.G Hoover and brother banham goes and dedicates his church in in the 50s there and down in Elizabethtown Kentucky and brother LG Hoover his mom was a Praying believing Christian and and she actually would would go and and brother Brandon would have her come in as a nanny for some of the children there in their home that she would help with the children when brother Branham and sister Brandon were traveling and things like that and and brother Hoover has a lot of testimonies about that that he can share you sometime but but when LG Hoover brother Hoover's dad was was a young man he joins the military or he was drafted I can't remember which but he winds up in World War II at a battle called the Battle of the Bulge which was a very bloody battle that not a whole lot of people came out of and and I had an uncle on my mom's side we've married one of her sisters and and he and my uncle he he was a Purple Heart veteran there from the Battle of the Bulge and he looked like Santa Claus he had a big old white beard and things but he was in that battle and almost all of his platoon got destroyed and so LG Hoover he's over here and they get to where the Battle of the Bulge is going to be there and and there there's a hotel there that the U.S troops come in and take control of and they think we're finally going to be able to spend the night in a nice bed tonight and then there was a man there with the English troops that he outranked the U.S officer there and he came in and said you get these U.S troops out of here the English troops are going to sleep in a bed tonight so they had to go out and just find different places around this Village to sleep well brother L.G Hoover he finds himself in a chicken coop with a uh I I believe it was a African-American man on one side of him and uh no I'm sorry it was a Mexican man on one side of him him and a Native American Indian on the other side of him and these three men bunched together in this chicken coop sleeping and in the middle of the night the Germans realize that they're there in the city and they begin to bomb the hotel and begin to shoot bombs and shoot missiles and things in and begin to destroy it in about four in the morning the top of the chicken coop disappears it explodes and and they sit up and they looked at one another and said what is it taking place here and LG said well I don't know but he said we're all right let's go back to sleep and in the middle of all this they go back to sleep in the middle of the night in this chicken coop well the the Native American Indian man was sleeping in the middle of the two other men and when they woke up they looked down and he was sleeping with his legs spread out like this and right in the middle of his legs was a mortar shell buried in the ground but it didn't go off I'm sure they very carefully got out of that chicken coop and he was a little Shook Up by this and so they would go and and they would begin to get their supplies and things the next day and after the battle was over and and they began to recuperate their lines and things and patent had got some people around behind the German lines and and brought them back some reinforcements and they were able to win that battle even though they were outnumbered and surrounded initially and so as things begin to catch up with the process there they begin to get mail again through the lines and and LG goes down one day to get a letter and there's a letter that's dated the day of the Battle of the Bulge and it's from his mother and he opens it up and she said LG I don't know where you are and said it's four in the morning and God woke me up and she said I'm praying for you [Applause] and she said I sent something with you in this letter and she'd taken from her Bible and cut out the psalm there and it said of thousands of all the left of thee and a thousand shall fall to the right but it won't touch you [Applause] God knows what he's doing he knows the path that he's chose for you maybe if it had been you you would have chose a different path brother random said he what if he wanted to be a Trapper he wanted to be back there with Bud Southwick and just let everything go and go out there but God showed him what that future held God had a better choice for him hey when I was 21 I was a a young man with a call on my life in Jeffersonville Indiana where preachers if you don't know aren't very popular and all the girls that I wanted to date weren't interested in dating a preacher and I decided I was going to move to Indianapolis and be a police officer but God had different plans for me that was my plan but God had a different plan amen Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4. according as he hath chosen us in him when I came to an altar one time when somebody handed me a message book when somebody gave me a Bible he had chosen Us in him nation of the world now people who get mad at brother Brandon for preaching predestination they ought to be honest with themselves and get mad at Paul and get mad at the Lord Jesus and get mad at John the Revelator and get mad at all these other men that talked about predestination he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world before when God created the earth and the dust that was there in the earth he pulled Adam from that and each one of us was laying there in the dust and and before that dust was even created before you were even thought of by Humanity before your parents had any idea that you were on the way before Adam was breathed the breath of life into his lungs before there was a moon or a star or a Galaxy or a universe before the Earth was created God before the foundation of the world had you in his mind and not only did he have you in his mind he chose you in him before the foundation of the world he could look down before Jeremiah was born and say before you were formed in your mother's womb I chose you and I ordained you I elected you to be a prophet of God Amen well if he knew that Jeremiah would be a prophet he knew what I would be he knew what she would be that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now I won't ask you to raise your hand but I'll just raise my hand and say hey there's so many times I don't feel holy and Without Blame [Applause] because by my works and by my abilities I'm not holy and I'm not without blame but I'm holy and Without Blame because he's not looking at my human weakness he's not looking at my failures he's not looking for every time I Stumble he's looking at what his thought was of me before the foundation of the world Amen he chose me in him before the foundation of the world we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now brother remember says in the church age book he says you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world amen before you had any choice in it God looked down through time and said I Choose You that's right amen you can't outrun election God chose you how did you come to this oh I came to this because somebody handed me a book no that that's how you begin to realize how you came to this well when were you saved all brother names and it was at a camp meeting I remember who was preaching I remember the song leader I remember who was playing the music that night I remember the sermon and I came down to the altar that's when I say no that's when you realize that you were saved you were saved before the foundation of the world with me she saved oh I was saved Back 2 000 years ago when Jesus died on Calvary no that's when the price was paid for your salvation but you were saved before the foundation of the world God looked down through time and he said I choose this one I choose that one because I see something in them I see the nature that's in them I see what they'll be because I've elected them by my foreknowledge and he chose you and you say well my brother Nathan Jesus wasn't even crucified then how can I be saved because the Bible said that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world now he wasn't physically slain but in God's mind he had already thought it and so it was going to take place no matter how many demons out of hell tried to stop it it was going to take place because in God's mind there was a lamb who had been slain now we can say Amen to that but can we say Amen to the fact that we were in his mind as well and doesn't matter how many demons out of hell try to stop it you didn't choose him he chose you amen the Bible said we love him amen because he first loved us the man said you didn't go seeking after God God went seeking after you you say oh no brother Nathan I remember I got a burden on my heart I begin to feel a pull yes but who put that pool there you were just responding to the fact that he came seeking and searching after you if you ever sought him it was only because he was seeking you first he came seeking and searching those who he had predestinated now brother Banner would say it this way he said there in the journey in the wilderness the children of Israel it said that there wasn't one of them that was feeble among them they were healthy through the Journey he talks about Dr Moses's script bag what it must have looked like there and he said somebody came up said I've got a toothache he said oh I've got something for you here open up his doctors back somebody came up and said oh I got this I got that what was his prescription I am the Lord that healeth all thy diseases and so there wasn't a feeble one among them all that time they went through there and sickness was stayed back from them God said what was God said excuse me well God said it through the prophet but rather than said that what God did there was he allowed Israel to draw dividends on a down payment that hadn't been made yet they were drawing strength from an atonement that hadn't even been made yet it had just been promised to mind it was settled amen that even though it hasn't actually come to completion yet I know that the price is paid so hey I want you to go down here to the bank and say hey I've got a rich aunt and I'm in her will and you know when she dies she's going to leave me all this money so I'd just like to go ahead and start drawing dividends on that investment they'll laugh at you they'll run you out of the bank but God allowed it amen God allowed them to draw dividends on a down payment that hadn't even been made yet all friends and then we get flustered and we get worried oh God I do you understand and God do you see and God do you care he cared so much that before there was even a World created in here in his mind he knew about you he knew what your trial would be he knew it's your Temptation would be he knew what your circumstance would be he knew the pressures he knew the things that she would face the opposition and the persecution and he was already making a way for you before you needed a way he had already provided away Church age book again they he's talking about the children of Israel there in the wilderness they had their side that wasn't praiseworthy sounds like he's talking about some message believers phaseworthy but in spite of their imperfections by the purpose of God that works through election by grace and not by works they had the cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night they had the smitten a rock and the Brazen serpents and the signs and wonders they were Vindicated not in themselves but in God amen he chose me it was his choice that elected me I didn't come up with this I didn't work myself into this I didn't educate myself into this he chose me amen then he's obligated to carry me through Jacob have I loved and Esau have a hate and let's be honest just like these other men that we looked at if we had been choosing we would have chose the exact opposites we would have looked at Esau and said hey he's a pretty good church member hey look at his attendance records and look at his tithe records and look how nice he is to his mommy and his daddy my he'd make a good Deacon or a good Sunday school teacher look at this man look at his works and God looked down and said I chose Jacob I love Jacob and I hate Esau and we look at he saw a little seister a deceiver always trying to go around do something but there was something in Jacob he didn't care how he got the birthright he just knew he had to have it and Esau looked at the same thing and despised the birthright it was something that had become common to him and that attribute in them God looked down through time he said I love Jacob and I hate Esau amen hey there were better people in New Albany Indiana when I was born in 1982 in Floyd Memorial Hospital there there were better people that God could have picked he didn't pick me because I was better than somebody he picked me because he saw an attribute down inside of me that was a reflection of damn Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it and all the sisters said that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it unto himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish don't raise your hands this morning but how many feels holy and without blemish come on now I don't feel holy and without blemish you can watch my life for a while and you recognize brother Nathan he's my he's a pretty good brother but without spot or without wrinkle without anything any any blemish I don't know about that but I can look back and shoot and say the same thing but Paul says that God chose this church knowing that she would be without spot or wrinkle without a blemish holy brother Adam said how's it going to be he said I don't know but God's word said it'll be so there'll be one that's there Jesus says in Matthew chapter 5 verse 48 be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect well I won't ask you to raise your hands on this either but how many feel perfect this morning well don't worry I wouldn't have my hand up either I don't feel perfect talk to my wife long enough she'll explain to you in detail I'm not perfect I haven't met a perfect pastor I haven't met a perfect deacon I haven't met a perfect song leader or a perfect Sunday school teacher I haven't met a perfect evangelist I haven't met a perfect church member but Jesus says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect well how are we going to do these things a church without spot or blemish not ring not a wrinkle holy and then we got to be perfect as our Father in heaven was perfect well it looks like Jesus set the bar higher than we're able to attain to all right now you're beginning to realize what we've been looking at this weekend that it's not our ability it is impossible for me to attain to these scriptures that we just read it is impossible for me I don't have enough good works I don't have the ability I don't have the personality I don't have the wisdom the knowledge I don't have the ability to fulfill this on my own but I'm so thankful he's not expecting me to fulfill it on my own law in 1955 brother Brandon says now the blood could not be perfect by an animal but the blood in Christ was perfect now I will never be perfect and you will never be perfect I will never be perfect in your sight you will never be perfect in my sight but let's let's lay that aside what about in God's sights so that's what matters you know I it's not I don't say it to be to be cruel or or just to brush aside but when it comes right down to it what you think about me doesn't matter what I think about you doesn't matter really what we think about ourselves doesn't matter so much because many times the devil can get us in a corner where we think pretty low about ourselves but let's lay that aside let's lay all that aside what about God's sight I look at you as a human I look at she was a brother but God looks at you through the blood of his son as a redeemed one Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and not what you've done you have nothing to Merit it but it's what Christ did for you oh do you see it the Perfection 1957 then my salvation yours tonight does not hinge upon the merits of our own acts it hinged upon the positive Sovereign Grace of almighty God who has chosen Us in him certainly I can never be perfect nor you could never be perfect and we don't claim to be perfect but we have this one consolation that our faith rests in a perfect sacrifice that's already been received man that kind of takes the pressure off doesn't it because I'm not depending on me I'm depending on him I'm not resting in me I'm resting in him oh Saint Paul we looked at him yesterday how that God had brought him from a man who persecuted the church a man who was constantly going about trying to upset and pull people out of churches and put him in prison and even consenting under their death and God takes this man and he calls him with such a high calling that he makes him the prophet messenger for that first church says the Ephesians Church age and he stands there no doubt feeling inadequate no doubt feeling unworthy and God would get a hold of his life in such a way and Paul would say it this way to the Corinthians and and in chapter 1 verse 5 of Corinthians for I am the least of the Apostles as we looked at it the other day I don't think he was just saying this humbly I don't think he was just trying to show people his humility and and all what a what a nice man that Paul is but he's saying this from his heart I'm the least of the Apostles that I'm not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church but by the grace of God I am what I am what's your testimony brother Nathan you want it in a nutshell but by the grace of God I am what I am wasn't because of my family name wasn't because of my ability wasn't because of of how many chapters of the Bible I read or how many tapes that I listened to or how many services I attend or or any any good work that I could do it wasn't because of that it was just his grace we sing it so many times that I think it just becomes a song to us instead of Our Testimony but I hope you don't lose sight of it the son said his grace has brought me safe this far and Grace will lead me on we have a tendency that when we get Beyond a trial when we get out of that Valley and we're on the Mountaintop all we look back we say oh thank you God you're so mighty you're so powerful God you're so good to us and then we get in the next trial and we forget about that we forget about all the things that he's brought us from and and the dark trials and how how desperate our circumstances looked and and yet God brought us through that and we can look back down through life and see he brought me from this sickness and he brought me from this persecution he brought me from this financial distress or or this circumstance in my personal life that I didn't know God how am I ever going to get Beyond this and yet he brought you through and then we get in the next round oh God I guess you just don't care I guess you just don't understand no the same God that brought you through the last trial can bring you through this one that's why God didn't just throw David out in the front of a giant there but he allowed a lion and a bear to come in and no doubt David could go down to the other Shepherds and say hey you all having any lying problems you all having any bad problems they'd say no man what are you talking about we haven't seen lions or bears around here in years he said well I don't understand every time I turn around there's something trying to come in and steal my sheep and I've got to raise up and fight against it and why why me God why did you allow these pressures on me instead of these other Shepherds because God was not training them to be giant slayers [Applause] God trusts us with trials because he knows what we can stand and he doesn't allow us to have more on us than we can bear and he pressurizes us for the pressures of the age and we look around we say oh God why did you allow this because he's preparing you for something he has to build a character inside of you he has to get you into a condition to be Rapture Ready and then we look at it and say well why doesn't my neighbor go through this and why doesn't this other brother go through this or go through that maybe God's not going to use them the way that he's going to use you maybe your testimonials shake the gates of hell when you stand and maybe see a little sister there that's going through a trial and maybe she doesn't know what to do or where to turn and she's about to lose her mind and you step up and you say it's honey I I know I know I was just like you I was going through this or I was going through that but I want to tell you God brought me through [Applause] yourself God can do it for little sister so and so surely he can do it for me there's many times in prayer lines where somebody will come up you know hey I I've never gone through menopause I don't plan to I don't identify as a 60 year old woman I don't plan to I told somebody I'm gonna start identifying as a senior citizen so I can get that discount at the restaurants people identify all this crazy stuff and Sanity right but I've never gone through that so I can pray for a sister and show her quotes of what brother Branham said about it I can try to encourage her but you know who can be a better help to her is a sister who's gone through it and come out the other side Victorious maybe it's how I felt like I was losing my mind I was so nervous I was so upset the devil tormented me I drove my husband crazy but you know what I came through it we came through Victorious good they can help more than I can yeah my wife and I never we never had a miscarriage I can pray for people I can sympathize with them I can some quotes and scriptures I can try to be an encouragement I can't Comfort them the way that somebody else that has gone through that camp that's right right I've had back pains from lifting something heavier than I should have lifted and pulling a muscle or something like that or sitting in the wrong position too long or something and and pulling a muscle or something about I've never had chronic back pain from disc troubles and things like that I pray I never do I've never had problems with my sciatic nerve and things like that I pray I never do and so when somebody comes up with in a prayer line that has had just extreme back trouble there's a couple brothers that if they're not there in the prayer line sometimes I'll call them up and have them pray with us because they've gone through that and they can enter into that person's suffering and they can tell them hey I've been there but God brought me through [Music] we go through trials and we think oh God why didn't you allow this maybe God is preparing you to be an encourager for somebody else maybe God is using your testimony to deliver others and to help others somebody said oh my I wish I had brother Ron Spencer's testimonies I don't know that's right I don't say that to be detrimental to brother Ron I wouldn't want to go through what he's gone through to have those testimonies if God didn't call you to that you might not have made it through those trials and pressures I don't want his trials but I'm thankful that there's somebody that's standing that has testimonies like that it's encouraging to us the Paradox 1963 brother Brandon said I've seen critics stand off and make fun and carry on of the Holy Ghost Revival and after a while god get a hold of that same man and change him and here he stands right in the Pulpit preaching the same thing that he once hated it's a paradox how that God can take the unbeliever and make a Believer out of it praise the Lord amen we still serve that same God amen what a testimony that God could take somebody that hated it was against it turn them around and set them on fire for God do you realize that's what he did with Paul Paul was persecuting it and God got a hold of him and turn him around I want you to notice my I love this next quote here brother Branham talking and the grace that he has for people that are sitting there are even in their mind disagreeing and and in their mind thinking that it's false or thinking that it's a gimmicker or thinking that that you know that this isn't this can't be real and they're against it in their mind but Grace looks beyond your current condition Grace looks beyond your current attitude and your current condition your current situation and many times as Believers as we looked at with Samuel there he looked at a lion's physical condition and a stature and he judged him by that and said that must be the king but he hadn't even seen David yet but if he had seen him that would have been the last one there that he would have pitched and sometimes we'll look at somebody and we look at their current condition we look at their current attitude we look at their their current Outlook and and the current weight maybe they're not very receptive uh to the sermons I had a a young sister that used to her parents used to bring her to church and you could tell by the expression her faith she didn't want to be there sure you could preach her heart out and she'd sit there and just stare a hole right through you no no emotion no expression she come to the youth Bible studies and things and I think goodness gracious you can tell this girl just does not want to be here and now she married a young man for from our area and her family doesn't go to our church anymore they don't go to as far as I know they don't have a home church and there she is faithful every Sunday if I'd have been judging just by our outward appearance and you'd ask who from this family will be coming should have been the last one I would have picked she's the one that's faithful because God looked beyond her current attitude and her current condition amen if you'd have looked at me as a 19 year old you wouldn't have picked me to be the guy that was preaching this revival meeting this weekend not that guy no you wouldn't you wouldn't have liked me as a 19 year old probably but God rich in Mercy but by the grace of God I am what I am I'll share this this part of the testimony I've shared at other places maybe it'll help a young person as I said I was raised in the message and raised in a message church and but that wasn't good enough just having a Christian Mommy and Daddy just attending a Christian Church that wasn't good enough for me I had to have an experience for myself and so I found that God as a very young man four or five years age I found out I had a call of God on my life to minister and as I began to be a teenager and recognized how unpopular that was in our area especially I began to run from that call of God in my life and I found out a little secret that the the further I got away from God the quieter that call got and the closer I got to God the stronger that call got I was up here at Brother Ray Erickson's Church in a meeting one night and brother Ron Spencer was preaching he looked right down at me made direct eye contact said there's a young man here tonight that God's got a call on his life I thought look somewhere else brother Ron he didn't have to tell me I knew foreign and I ran from it and I got to the spot where you know I I'll just be transparent with you this this one I never cared for alcohol I didn't enjoy the The Taste I didn't enjoy the effects but I wanted to prove to my buddies how big and bad I was so I'd get together with a couple of them that they'd also been raised in the message and had an apartment there and and they they moved out for Mommy and Daddy I was still back home with Mommy and Daddy but I'd go visit them and and sometimes I'd spend the night with them or different things and and you know they'd have one of them was old enough to buy alcohol and so he'd buy alcohol for all the rest of us and there I was as a 19 year old man and empty bottles in the trash cans and going to bed that night one of the young men that owned the apartment or rented it there he said you care if I turn on a tape well I've heard of mixed drinks but I didn't like mixing that together you know I didn't usually mix those two together but see he had got to a spot and he's he's passed on now I pray that that God got a hold of his soul before he left this world but but he'd got to a spot to where to listen to that voice it didn't convict him anymore it didn't condemn him it was just something he had been used to that comforted him to go to sleep at night it'd become background noise did it become white noise that just just something that was just out here you know on a surface level but wasn't entering down and so I said hey it's your your apartment you do what you want he said well I've only got two CDs here and he said I've got life story but I played that last night I said so I'll play this other one that I've got man running from the presence of the Lord and I laid there all night with that on repeat and it was like Adam Where Art Thou and I'd love to tell you that I just woke up the next morning I was filled with the Holy Ghost and and I went out and began to jump over a troop and leap over a wall and and but no it wasn't like that but it was a turning point it was a spot that God got my attention and I recognized that cannot be a coincidence out of 1200 to something tapes that you would have a man who was in no condition to be wanting to listen to it take play a tape that night and out of all the tapes that he could have picked to play that tape it got my attention there were other things that would happen that would get my attention and I began to turn around and I begin to to take steps in his Direction I found out whenever I'd take a step in his Direction he'd take several more in my direction I'll just try him this morning maybe you say but brother Nathan I've been on the wrong path and I've made the wrong choices oh yes he knows all about it he knew you'd make those choices before you did but just take a step towards him this morning and see what he'll do brother Randall says in Abraham's Covenant confirmed 1961 now listen Church I want to drop this in here because I believe the Holy Spirit told me to do it you may be sitting there which some of you are I know you are disagreeing with me right now I can call your name if you want me to my goodness he says now I'm going to drop this in here because the Holy Spirit wanted me to and there's some of you sitting here disagreeing with me and I can call your name if you want me to he said so I know that but I also can see farther than that amen that you're gonna believe it one of these days amen so I'm gonna just put this in so you'll understand so I can give you a little spot of Grace here oh what do you say this morning brother Nathan I say thank you God for a little spot of Grace that was left to me that even when I was bad even when I was wrong even when I was unlovable yet God knew my attitude he knew my thoughts he knew my opinion he knew my condition but he left a little spot of Grace there because he could look a little further than my current circumstance and see what I was going to be down the road amen amen I can give you a little spot of Grace here when it ain't going to be too long until you're going to change your mind some of you some of you won't oh I'm so thankful he had a man God had a man that could look a little further [Music] Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen all right thank you Lord oh if he started to work in your life you may not be a you may not be able to compare with some of these other brothers and sisters around the message and and the devil keeps getting you to look and compare your life with theirs and and where they're at now but maybe they're way further in the journey than you are and maybe if they can take you back to their testimony just like I did and begin to show you hey you're looking at me now all right but if you only knew how far he'd brought me from and so you start off with Jesus and brother Adam said men aren't born men they're born babies and you look at some of these spiritually mature Christians and you think oh God why am I like that person well let them tell you their testimony from 20 years ago and you'll find they weren't always that way either but I believe they tell you but he who began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ brother Samuel sang that song He's still working on me and I was driving in the car yesterday my wife was telling me to do this and do that and I said she's still working on me to make me what she wants to be foreign I'll preach the rest of the sermon from down here Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore sing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every way in the Sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith Jesus isn't like me and the way that I'm a procrastinator I'll start a project and well I'll get distracted I'll have good intentions to do something and I'll do something else I uh I'll start a book sometimes I probably have about 30 books at home that I've started and didn't finish because you know I got bored with a certain part in it or something and picked up the next book that looked a little more interesting I think they'd call that ADHD is what they try to label me as but I don't want your labels squirrel oh sorry [Applause] I don't want your label but Jesus isn't like me at least I didn't say Chipmunk we had a chipmunk emergency yesterday oh my God but Jesus isn't like that he doesn't start with brother Samuel and I said well you know he's he's not coming along as fast as I want him to I'll go to brother Stephen and then brother Stephen I I got a little distracted with him I'll go over brother Ray and I'll go to this one that one just leave us half finished projects all up all over but when God begins to work he's going to see it through to the completion he's not just the author of our faith he's the finisher of our faith young people middle age old whatever you are this morning I want to remind you that God is not just in the saving business but he's in the keeping business if he's powerful enough to save you he's powerful enough to keep you amen what does it take to make a Christian Life 1957 there isn't enough power in all hell that can ever defeat the purpose of God amen God will do it anyhow now I want to read you two more sections of scripture before we close these services and I I just want to look at some things well you know a culture out here will say all kinds of things about you they'll try to label you they'll try to put you in a box somewhere message Believers they'll try to get a spot where they can they can put you and say oh yes he's of this group or he believes this Doctrine or he believes that they're looking for a way to put you in a box so that they can figure you out and oh yeah okay I know what he's made out of and and they'll just set you off to this side or that sign and and the devil he'll tell you all kinds of things about yourself and he's got all kinds of ideas and opinions and hey if there's one thing I found about message folks we've got a lot of opinionated message folks you just ask one of them what they think about you know they'll be honest with you and tell you and maybe they have all kinds of opinions and thoughts and you should do this and you shouldn't do that and they can give you their list but I want to tell you this morning what God says about you Jeremiah 29 verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end God knows what your end is going to be amen amen he knows you know we look so Romans chapter 8 verse 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called in whom he called then he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then of these things if God before us who can be against us he that spare not his own son but delivered him up for us for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth oh I know him oh I can tell you a little bit about them I can post something on Facebook about them and I can I can tweet about them and I can do this and I can send you some text messages but who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it's God who justify us right I was telling some of the brothers yesterday you know I you see some of these people they walk away from the message and they have all these complaints and they have their websites and they have their attacks and and but I want to see their testimony pages on their websites [Applause] where's the supernatural in their midst of page after page after page and topic after topic after topic and news clipping after news clipping and they try to associate all these things to brother random and Page after page but I haven't found their testimony sites and so they have all this and they want to take you back they want to take you back to the world oh we can be free I don't want that kind of freedom they're serving somebody they're just not serving the same one we're serving they say oh you're just following a man yes well at least the man I'm following was Vindicated the men you're following I wouldn't follow across the street [Applause] everybody's following somebody no that's right that's right some of these men I wouldn't follow across the street right let alone out of the message that's right some of these men I wouldn't believe them if they said good morning let alone if they said brother randoms of false prophets God Amen I've seen their lives I don't want what they have to produce I'm not interested and so I can look and I can see what Jesus did for me that's very plain I can see what he did to help me and all the sacrifices he made I can look at brother Brandon's life and I can look at the hours of family time and of leisure time and a vacation time that he sacrificed so that he could be traveling somewhere preaching the gospel and praying for the sick and laying this message in for us I see what he did for me but I asked what have they done for me right right that's right that's true that's right yes I had a man you'd know his name probably if I called him one of the Ring leaders of some of this stuff he kept trying to send me stuff I said listen you're just wasting your time right you're wasting your time you got here too late I've seen in action what this message produces [Applause] so some friends of a good brother uh at our church some friends of his went down to Indianapolis and spent their whole family vacation at a library trying to find death certificates to try to prove this guy wrong they were determined they were going to find 16 death certificates at the Indianapolis Library there and they went through all kinds of records and all kinds of things and they wound up leaving the message over it they couldn't find enough evidence I found all the evidence I needed a long time ago and so they did find two death certificates though of men that died in the construction of that bridge and they gave it to this guy who they'd been trying to refute and joined up with him and started their own website and so he sent me a thing on Facebook back when I was still on Facebook and he said he said listen we found out that that Branham guy said you know he he was wrong it wasn't 16 men it was two and so I just shot right back because you know me brother Samuel I can't keep my mouth shut I said oh that is so interesting I said last year you told me there was Zero now you say there's two I said you're an eighth of the way there buddy you just keep digging [Applause] I don't need their proof no sir amen I've seen the proof of the Resurrection amen the soldiers there could say hey they came and stole his body away but when his life came back in The Believer how did they explain that who was that that came back on the believer brother Chris Kathy and some of the brothers from here I think different ones are over in Israel right now going and seeing some of the things and I'm just trying to pray and say God help me not to Envy my brother's trip help me not to get that Spirit on me you know and so they've been texting us all kinds of pictures and videos of Rome and Israel and on the Sea of Galilee listening to the testimony on the sea on a boat like Jesus was on during that time and my they're just sending me stuff left and right so brother Samuel took me down to Charles Finney's tomb and I got a picture beside it and I said hey this two may not be empty but it's the best I could do on my salary but we have an empty tomb [Applause] amen I can take you to where Jesus was laid but he's not there it's an empty tomb who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it's God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword or critics or websites come on I'm not interested in going back to the Baptist Church I'm not interested in going back to the Pentecostal church I'm not interested in going back to the Catholic church I'm not interested in going back to the bar stool who shall separate us as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter name in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor thing things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord let's stand together this morning nothing's going to separate us thank you Lord you say oh brother Nathan I feel so defeated I feel so discouraged well that's your thoughts well the devil came and he told me that I'm not worthy and that I'll never make it and that I'm a failure where that's the devil's thoughts God said we're more than conquerors God said his thoughts to us or to bring us to an expected end thoughts of peace and joy and mind what a blessed people we are spout our heads together Lord Jesus Lord I'm so thankful Lord that it wasn't left up to me Lord that the choosing was not in myself but that you did the choosing Lord if we had chosen ourselves Lord we would have no doubt wondered at some point oh God am I the right one did I make the right choice but Lord we didn't have any choice in it it was you who chose us before the foundation of the world we just came to a spot where we recognized that you had chose us as we said the other night brother Branham said they're in the church age book it takes a son sometimes a long time to recognize that he's a son but Lord we didn't you didn't take us from being a pig or a goat and make us into his sheep you didn't take us from being a chicken or a buzzard and make us an eagle Lord we were a child of God all along it just took us a while to recognize it yes so we're thankful for eyes to see and here's to hear we're thankful for your choosing as brother Adam said in one place if God without us having any choice in it could have brought our grandparents and our parents and all these together to bring us here without us having any choice in it then what can he do now that we can choose him as well what can he do now that we can agree with him in this choice help us Jesus when Satan comes and begins to lie to us begins to speak his thoughts over us Lord may we not take his word for it but may our mind go back to these quotes and scriptures that were read this weekend Lord may it give us courage and strength to recognize it's not me I don't have the ability I don't have the strength it's not me that's holding on it's him that's holding on to me oh how we love you Jesus we worship you we thank you for all that you do I pray if there's any here Lord that has hasn't recognized you in that way Lord that before they leave today they'll settle it here forever and say God I accept what you've done

[Music] love of God [Music] amen hallelujah [Music] one more time [Music] this is amen [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah how many can just say I have been refreshed have been refreshed you know I think my God has spoke so personally so personally and you know the thing within it is that we not only want to be able to see the grace of God for our own lives we must see the grace of God for every life when we can really see it to the debt that we need to be then we can look at it and look at one another and I thought God has just moved in such a special way and I'm glad you know God never nobody in the church here at least nobody should have a black and white striped shirt up and down walking around with black pants and a whistle [Music] if we're able to do that then we got too much time but the more we stand before the presence of God and in his throne we recognize the grace of God that we need in our own lives and it will take Grace all the way through amen and you know and that was so tremendous even how God spoke to us through those things of where the many of the times we can look at others before us but to realize nobody jumps to a certain spot in God you don't skip the rapture's not a jump the Rapture is not a skip the Bible said Enoch want with God walked with God and Enoch's name is when you look at his name dedicated dedicated what was he dedicated to he was dedicated to the Lord when the Lord said Enoch you're wrong in this area dedicated himself by repenting and saying yes Lord when God said Walk This Way yes Lord he was just dedicated to the voice of God now you might we don't have all of the records we don't have all of the things wrote out about Enoch's life that we do about Abraham's life we don't even have a lot of details like the Holy Spirit it brought out about Noah's life and the rest of them but God included what was needed to pick up for you and I and we can look back and realize that even with Enoch's life which is our time it was nothing but the grace of almighty God and that's why we're standing here today you know what's important is that we've received the grace of God that even as the word has been ministered God's grace begins to move in our life I'm just going to say it right here even as the spirit of the Lord made that statement here about turning points I believe there's been turning points in these meetings I believe that some things you may not even see right now but there's been turning points I believe there's needs that you've held before God they may not even be sitting in the building right here but they don't have to be said we've got a almighty God with an All-Seeing Eye he knows exactly where it's at amen he is faithful and true amen oh my how many have just appreciated the word of the Lord appreciate the friends of God my mama amen how many like that brother Nathan come back [Applause] okay third week in June [Music] amen no we have we have feasted on the word of God and take the word of God and you know what God has given us is just like what he told Samson Samson saw the Jawbone of an ass God the same word that is brought loosening and brought Liberty and brought encouragement that same word in Revelation is what you will use to stand and fight the devil maybe it'll be a moment from now or an hour from now but the same word it will back the devil off amen because what God Said is true how many know that to be true brother Graham said it like this he said when a minister gets done preaching he said Satan will come right at him he said on Monday morning and try to knock all the confidence out of him that the Holy Spirit instilled in him now I know not only just for ministers but he'll do it to everyone we're leaving out of these services and we've been refreshed I I have been spoken to if I'd have been the only one in the building for him to come and speak to I would have said I have had a Time I've shouted I've wanted to shout a whole lot more but I wanted to hear and then there's things that I have just sat there and wept and I just like God has read me through and through it's like he had me up there instead of them slides hey man how may feel that way how personal God is don't you love it I tell you what you ought to take that if God be for us who can be against us God has spoken God has spoke over our life and who can but prophesy who can say anything contrary to God's word oh Hallelujah Lord I feel like a praise break [Music] amen praise the Lord just remember here this evening this afternoon about 5 30 or 6. Lord willing we'll come back and have a little bit of Fellowship here around the fire I don't think I'm missing anything else please remember to bring your lawn chairs if you have them if not we won't make you we won't make you stand so everybody feeling good amen God is so good amen let's just let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer amen we just want to say to the Bryant family God bless you thank you thank you for the ministry amen father or sometimes I the only words Lord I can say is thank you doesn't seem enough thank you Father for coming in ministering Lord to each of our needs [Music] once again once again I stand amazed Lord I stand In Awe how great you are you would make yourself so simple and so little to speak Lord to our needs Lord we are your workmanship we've not been crafted by the hands of man but it's your workmanship and you're bringing out bringing out all of that that you have placed within us every chunk that Michelangelo took off of that piece of marble that was something that was not in his mind and he worked to set free Moses who was in that chunk of marble and God you in your great Mercy have moved Lord to set us free from the mud and the gum and all the gunk as your Prophet said all the dirt that was packed in US Lord we're standing here as trophies of your not by words that we have done but by the grace of almighty God Lord this same message that you have delivered to us right here in the end time breathed Upon Us Lord and once again here this morning oh God that same word Lord fulfilling thou must prophesy again you have spoken Lord over our lives Lord you have spoken lord of the blessings of God now we look to the same Rapture in Grace Lord God the Lord to pack us Lord God that same quickening power just as yield to you Lord be it unto me according to that word we love you father like Enoch we're not hopping skipping or jumping we're just gonna walk one step at a time [Music] it's brother Nathan Lord in that testimony you placed upon his heart to say when he was going away from you the more distant that voice became but Lord as he was turned to you and the more he began to walk towards that voice the more clear the more the greater it became Lord father I believe here this morning that God that's what Lord Jesus that we can say Lord in our lives and our hearts that oh God we want to be in tune with your voice step by step by step by step bless brother Nathan sister Rebecca Lord the family God how we just appreciate the labor of love thank you for the ministry Lord and father when we say that we realize Lord God that the family it's one unit Lord God you've equipped him Lord God to be able to minister Lord and be a blessing not only in the area where they are I believe you've ordained them I have no doubt about that Lord but God what a blessing Lord Jesus that they have been to us Lord and I thank you Father may you just Lord not only refresh and strengthen brother Nathan bless the church there Lord bless his ministry and I pray that God that for sister Rebecca Lord and the family that God will continue to pour out your blessings Lord continue to strengthen them Lord and guide him Lord and granting Lord God the very desires of their heart Lord I pray we ask it Lord Jesus your blessings Lord upon your children this morning go with us Lord be with us this evening oh how we love you we go forth thanking you Lord for meeting every need thank you Jesus it's already done in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you amen just shake hands at one another as you're being dismissed greet
