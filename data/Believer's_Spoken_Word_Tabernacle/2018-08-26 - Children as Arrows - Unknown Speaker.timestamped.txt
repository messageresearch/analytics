[34:52] [Music]
[35:35] hallelujah aren't you thankful for that
[35:39] this morning a man that's real true
[35:42] Liberty to know the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:45] amen as your Savior you start to
[35:48] experience that Liberty even and knowing
[35:50] him as a savior you know what I'm saying
[35:54] when you surrender your heart to the
[35:57] Lord and you feel like my the Lord I've
[36:01] been carrying on I'm no longer carrying
[36:03] you come to the realization that he
[36:05] already bought your sins so the release
[36:09] that you have is where you turn to him
[36:12] as your Savior
[36:14] then when he moves into a deeper place
[36:18] in your heart and life to where you know
[36:21] him as your Redeemer
[36:22] oh that's it's just a greater Liberty so
[36:27] walking with the Lord
[36:28] it just gets brighter and brighter and
[36:32] it is truly the real true Liberty that
[36:36] there is and the only Liberty that there
[36:38] is in this life is to serve the Lord
[36:41] Jesus Christ amen
[36:44] he's the one that holds the keys amen to
[36:49] unlock aren't you glad for that this
[36:52] morning it really don't matter right now
[36:55] this morning as far as you to be focused
[36:58] on where you're sitting but it's to
[37:01] focus on him the scripture never says
[37:04] looking unto yourself but it says look
[37:07] unto Jesus who's the author and finisher
[37:10] of our faith and the Bible says it like
[37:14] this being confident of this one thing
[37:17] that he that hath begun the good work in
[37:19] you shall also perform it to the day of
[37:22] Jesus Christ being confident confidence
[37:24] is a wonderful thing but it's also can
[37:26] be a very bad thing it depends on what
[37:28] it's in Paul said be confident in this
[37:31] him he who begun the work will cap it
[37:36] off amen you love him this morning
[37:41] it's just good to be gathered together
[37:43] this morning in his presence I want to
[37:48] make mention here announcement brother o

[37:57] Sunday next thing that'll be this coming
[38:00] Thursday and next Sunday as well and so
[38:03] we wanted to just continue to keep that
[38:05] in prayer also I know that the meetings
[38:10] that were taking place it's posted on
[38:12] the bulletin board down there with the
[38:14] churches there in Lima and they don't
[38:17] have those meetings so maybe perhaps
[38:18] some of you may may be there as well
[38:22] but we want to remember that as well in
[38:24] prayer and no doubt there's many other
[38:26] meetings that are are going on at the
[38:29] same time as well but in all of those
[38:32] meetings we want to make sure that we're
[38:34] having a meeting with you amen and a
[38:37] wonderful I tell you it's just it's just
[38:40] so wonderful we want to make also
[38:44] mention to you that right after church

[39:05] we'll just keep you posted on that but I
[39:07] wanted to let you know of it September
[39:09] the 9th amen
[39:11] so we have a fellowship to be able to to
[39:15] get together with one another
[39:20] and I hope it works out to be outside
[39:26] I really do I I enjoy being outside I
[39:30] don't really like being a lot inside you
[39:34] know there's a room at my house and we
[39:37] looked at giving me a certain room for
[39:39] an office and I said it don't have
[39:41] enough windows in it I said I want the
[39:45] one with I need windows
[39:46] I need windows all around me I want to
[39:49] be able to look out and see my plants I
[39:51] want to be able to look out into the art

[39:55] that's me I you know I I just enjoyed
[39:59] that so much I enjoy being out there and
[40:01] so you know I believe it's a wonderful
[40:05] thing the creation of God don't you well
[40:11] we need to move on into the word if
[40:16] you'll stand with me and welcome our
[40:21] visitors bless you Isaiah right
[40:25] Isaiah wonderful day good to have you
[40:27] buddy
[40:30] well let's get in here Psalms 127 verse
[40:35] 1
[40:56] 120 Psalms 127 verse 1 you have it there
[41:02] licious bow our heads and a word of
[41:03] prayer and then we'll read the
[41:04] scriptures Heavenly Father as we Lord
[41:10] are gathered in this moment we're asking
[41:13] o God that you would come and be the
[41:16] speaker and the hearer Lord father we
[41:20] just want to submit our lives our hearts
[41:24] all that we are the Lord to you we ask
[41:28] that God that you'll take us together
[41:30] and that you would speak to our lives
[41:32] and Lord that you would you would break
[41:35] it Lord in a manner that it causes our
[41:38] understanding to be fruitful lord i Lord
[41:43] I don't know the words to say I know
[41:46] Lord the meditation that's been upon my
[41:48] heart that I am reserved to you Lord may
[41:52] you take control Oh God and minister to
[41:56] our hearts and father just oh God
[41:59] receive all the glory and the honor for
[42:02] every need that's gathered here this
[42:04] morning Lord may you make yourself so
[42:07] personally known Lord God according to
[42:11] the need that Lord they would have in
[42:13] you that they would recognize Lord and
[42:16] we would recognize your presence Lord
[42:18] father have your way now we pray in the
[42:21] name of Jesus Christ amen
[42:25] Psalms 127 verse 1 a song of degrees for
[42:32] Solomon except the Lord build the house
[42:38] they labor in vain that build it except
[42:45] the Lord keep the city
[42:48] the watchman waketh but in vain I want
[42:52] you to notice in both of these
[42:54] statements except the Lord
[42:56] remember Solomon was chosen and he was
[43:01] commissioned by God to build the house
[43:04] of the Lord but even in his choosing and
[43:07] his commissioning it had to be where his
[43:10] heart was submissive to God in order for
[43:14] God to bring forth what God had ordained
[43:16] for his life so this is instruction that
[43:19] David is given to Solomon that you could
[43:22] build it here's a pattern this pattern
[43:24] has been given but the scriptures
[43:26] remember in the book of Chronicles it
[43:28] says David gave the the pattern to
[43:32] Solomon by the spirit so we believe that
[43:37] was all of our heart that it's always
[43:40] pointing not to our natural abilities
[43:43] it's even within the word we cannot make
[43:45] the word come to pass it has to be him
[43:48] that's the secret that is within the
[43:51] hearts of the bride amen of the believer
[43:54] to know that it must be him in us to
[43:56] bring this word to past accept the Lord
[43:59] keep the city the watchman waketh but in
[44:01] vain it's wonderful you watch you're
[44:04] observant but yet we want eyes that are
[44:07] beyond our eyes we want the watchman the
[44:12] Lord Jesus Christ then he can direct us
[44:14] on things that even though we may not
[44:17] see it here but he can direct us on
[44:21] those things that even can be coming up
[44:23] down the road because God is God is the
[44:28] same yesterday today and forever
[44:30] is that right it's none of us today God
[44:33] the prophetic is still among his people
[44:36] the Holy Spirit amen so notice in verse
[44:40] 2 it is vain for you to rise up early to
[44:43] set up late to eat the bread of Sorrows
[44:46] for so he giveth his beloved sleep
[44:51] low children are in heritage of the Lord
[44:54] and the fruit of the womb is his reward
[44:59] as arrows are in the hand of a mighty
[45:02] man so our children of the youth happy
[45:07] is the man that hath his quiver full of
[45:09] them
[45:11] now remember happy is the man who has
[45:17] his quiver full of them I have I have a
[45:21] two different bows at the house I have a
[45:24] compound bow and it's got 12 spots in it
[45:28] for 12 arrows but then I have a crossbow
[45:32] and that crossbow only has a quiver for
[45:36] three so God knows the quiver that you
[45:41] have that's why you we you know someone
[45:46] maybe that would have a or there's many
[45:48] kids with this many kids or this many
[45:50] kids that's in God's hands and God will
[45:52] orchestrate that between that of the mom
[45:55] and the dad I believe that with all my
[45:58] heart I really do they shall not be
[46:01] ashamed but they shall speak with the
[46:04] enemies in the gate god bless you this
[46:08] morning you've been seated
[46:17] the Bible let's draw attention back to
[46:19] verse 3 where the scripture tells us
[46:21] that children are a heritage war they're
[46:24] an inheritance of the Lord and the fruit
[46:27] of the womb is his reward I believe that
[46:31] we can truly look at it in this manner
[46:34] that children are a blessing of the
[46:39] marriage union between a husband and a
[46:43] wife
[46:44] and we understand that every every child
[46:49] that would enter into this into this
[46:52] life they are brought forth by a
[46:54] creative law of God it wouldn't matter
[46:59] if the child or it was the as brother
[47:03] banham I think the words that he would
[47:05] put it you could take the honorious man
[47:07] and the honorious woman but still it is
[47:11] a law that God has already placed there
[47:15] and so there'll be a child that will
[47:18] come forth because of that Union and all
[47:23] the way down through the scriptures you
[47:25] will find settings and and situations
[47:29] where and I know sometimes there's
[47:32] things where people have been very
[47:34] troubled with things because of maybe
[47:36] the way that their birth entrance into
[47:40] this life and maybe it came through an
[47:43] act of adultery or was an unwed father
[47:46] and mother if you remember I've taken
[47:50] and I know not everybody was here for
[47:52] this but it's very important to hear as
[47:54] the Prophet will lay these words when he
[47:57] deals in questions and answer 64 and he
[48:00] says I cannot believe he says that that
[48:04] the act of adultery that that's a
[48:06] predestinated so as he's dealing with
[48:09] the the the act of how that it would
[48:12] come because remember God's intended way
[48:16] for a child to come is through the
[48:20] marriage covenant but see the grace of
[48:24] God we're in in the Old Testament the
[48:26] Prophet keeps bringing us back to this
[48:28] and as he's even answering the
[48:31] in sixty four the Holy Spirit is
[48:33] unfolding to him even in a greater
[48:36] measure the greatness and power of the
[48:39] blood of Jesus Christ where he said that
[48:41] back there in the Old Testament they had
[48:43] nothing that could atone or take care of
[48:46] that sin but he said with the blood of
[48:49] Jesus that's different
[48:52] aren't you glad because it's by the
[48:56] blood of the Lord Jesus when you think
[48:58] about it the way that every one of us it
[49:01] did not come by the fall then their
[49:05] birth and how that we enter in it comes
[49:07] by the permissive will of God but then
[49:10] through and by the blood of the Lord
[49:12] Jesus Christ we have received an
[49:15] invitation then to be born again and to
[49:20] have our character molded to his own
[49:23] glorious character that could not have
[49:25] been if there had not been a life that
[49:28] was given to bring you and I into a
[49:31] place of the new birth that you and I
[49:34] then might be able to dwell in God's
[49:37] perfect will and has his perfect will is
[49:40] working out in our life to where
[49:42] eventually this outside body will also
[49:45] match the redemption that has taken
[49:47] place in the soul it's God's working
[49:50] it's God's glory so when we look at it
[49:53] that's intended the creative law of God
[49:55] is intended within the marriage covenant
[49:57] and I I hope you will understand here
[50:00] this morning and I don't want to take
[50:02] anything for granted but I trust that
[50:04] these are things that even as we go
[50:07] through you you find that how it runs
[50:09] the continuity as we're saying even last
[50:11] week when God deals with things that
[50:14] where we look at in the natural remember
[50:16] if God is giving this direction for our
[50:19] homes or for our marriage then God
[50:22] Himself he himself must be and is a
[50:25] partaker of his own word because he's
[50:28] not someone separate from the word so
[50:31] then when we look at this and we we can
[50:34] see it within the the scriptures here
[50:37] you know the Bible I want to draw your
[50:39] attention to one part here that I
[50:41] believe is very important
[50:43] it goes into and verse four it says as
[50:46] arrows are in the hand of a mighty man
[50:48] so are children of the youth now this
[50:53] phrase so are children of the youth it's
[50:56] not talking about the age of the child
[50:58] this is talking about the parents and I
[51:02] want you to think about it within this
[51:04] right here yeah in in it takes strength
[51:07] in parenting it takes stamina I mean we
[51:13] you have to face it that even in
[51:15] parenting there's things that you will
[51:17] do and in reality you might rather would
[51:20] sit on the chair a little longer but but
[51:23] you realize I really don't feel like
[51:25] playing you know this game right here on
[51:28] the table but you recognize it's not
[51:31] about the game it's about them so it's
[51:38] not like that we're without stamina
[51:40] because we have all sorts of
[51:42] responsibilities as parents right now
[51:46] work and all everything that goes with
[51:48] it and so parenting I think that every
[51:52] one of us can't agree parenting takes in
[51:54] energy and it takes patience you don't
[51:59] have to be some great basketball star to
[52:01] play basketball with them you don't have
[52:05] to be a football star or you don't even
[52:07] have to sometimes you can learn things
[52:09] with them
[52:12] is that right sometimes you can
[52:15] sometimes you have to maybe there's
[52:17] certain interests and things that that
[52:19] they would have I remember when you know
[52:22] I look at it you know for many times
[52:24] with your children they'll find that
[52:25] they have a lot of interests that could
[52:27] be similar to yourself you know and yet
[52:30] then sometimes there might be some
[52:31] things that you need to kind of read up
[52:33] on a little bit
[52:38] in other words when we look at a
[52:41] youthfulness when we look at that in
[52:44] youthfulness because parenting is more
[52:46] than just bringing a child into the
[52:48] world it's a lot more than that now
[52:52] remember think of this in the spiritual
[52:54] context God God himself when he speaks
[52:58] in his word and says the Child Left to
[53:00] himself bringeth his mother shame God
[53:04] who is our Father the Holy Ghost is our
[53:07] mother come on now God is not going to
[53:11] leave us to ourselves because it's not
[53:16] just bringing us in birthing us and then
[53:17] just letting us discover things on our
[53:19] own but he's faithful to work with us to
[53:22] bring forth out of us what he himself
[53:24] has placed there within us so when you
[53:31] look at it that parenting is a lot more
[53:32] than just as bringing a child into the
[53:35] world you think of it even in the
[53:37] spiritual context as I mentioned but
[53:39] then look how Paul would relate to it
[53:42] even where here the the the birth here
[53:47] and how that everything begins to move
[53:49] forward Paul would deal with it in the
[53:51] Thessalonica Church he would deal with
[53:53] it in the Galatian you read up these
[53:55] things where Paul would even have those
[53:57] who would they would move in there they
[54:00] would ordained pastors within those
[54:03] cities to care for the flock so they
[54:06] could continue to move on you see it's
[54:08] God's desire to care for his children
[54:11] that's the same way that it is in in in
[54:15] in parenting from the heart it's a
[54:17] desire to care for that child
[54:21] God's desire is is is to continue to
[54:25] move within that within that realm and
[54:27] so there's natural necessities of life
[54:30] which we all know of clothing and food
[54:32] and shelter but there's also a part of
[54:35] relationship that is very important
[54:37] because the Lord Jesus himself said I go
[54:41] away to prepare a place for you and then
[54:43] he comes over in John 14 15 and 16 he
[54:46] says I will pray the father and he will
[54:48] give you another comforter why because
[54:52] it's not good that man should be alone
[54:55] the word alone in the Hebrew means bad
[55:00] that's not God's desire we were made and
[55:04] built to have relationship so when we
[55:11] look at this I'm gonna say some things
[55:13] and it might you might need a little bit
[55:15] of water to swallow it down but I
[55:17] believe it needs to be addressed
[55:19] according to some of these things here
[55:20] so don't don't start drawing up already
[55:22] and think man where's he going I'm going
[55:25] write down the word but we want to speak
[55:28] because what it is the conditions and
[55:31] things of this age and over time you and
[55:35] I have to walk and we walk out there in
[55:38] that world and let me just tell you like
[55:39] this our confidence must be in the Lord
[55:43] and I'm going to tell you if you don't
[55:45] really focus upon it you can find your
[55:47] mind and your thinking
[55:49] certain things start altering and
[55:51] changing and exceptions start being made
[55:53] but I can tell you right now God who
[55:55] gave the word he never put a footnote in
[55:58] it and said this will be able to be done
[56:01] except when it gets to this generation
[56:04] you don't find a footnote in the Bible
[56:09] so we recognize that in order to release
[56:12] the power of that word then then if of
[56:15] God keeping that word then it must bring
[56:17] a faith in that same God who gave that
[56:21] word that our faith in his position in
[56:23] Him who gave the word because if you're
[56:26] if you look just at what you see or even
[56:29] what you look at and say these are the
[56:31] only results that I'm seeing don't look
[56:33] the results look to him every day this
[56:38] is very this is a very simple part
[56:40] within the word but the Bible tells us
[56:42] in the book of Romans chapter 4 that
[56:45] Abraham's focus where the Bible says
[56:47] that he judged him faithful who made the
[56:51] promise so Abraham knew the promise but
[56:54] how Abraham was looking at the promise
[56:57] was keeping his eyes on him who made it
[56:59] because he who made it is the one who
[57:02] bringeth the past so remember as we've
[57:04] been looking at that the word you cannot
[57:06] approach the word that's just a letter
[57:08] but remember that word is God it's an
[57:11] expression it even when you know when
[57:13] God became one of us he took his own
[57:15] laws upon himself the things that he
[57:19] asked you and I have to do he himself
[57:20] fully expressed that law he had all of
[57:24] the that the challenges all around him
[57:26] he expressed all of that humility
[57:28] forgiveness all of those things had to
[57:31] be expressed and they were expressed
[57:33] within his life so God he is he is more
[57:36] than able and he knows how to help you
[57:39] and I to be able to minister these
[57:40] things in the right channel and so I say
[57:43] it in this way when we look at children
[57:45] of the youth I'll just say it's not
[57:46] God's ordained way for a grandparent to
[57:49] raise a child
[57:50] oh brother samuel well let me just let's
[57:55] just look at this a little bit in the
[57:56] word okay you see when you look at it
[58:00] the reality is is that you think about
[58:03] on the spiritual side God has no
[58:07] grandchildren and for all the
[58:13] grandparents in here
[58:20] some maybe more than others something
[58:25] you might be a grandparent eventually
[58:26] you'll come to this you counted ot
[58:32] both there's things you know that my dad
[58:39] who liked that one the hard man but but
[58:43] I believe in correction many times
[58:46] though you know the things that dad we
[58:47] could be out in public and he had a snap
[58:49] that had a certain tone to it I could
[58:51] have been somewhere out out in the woods
[58:53] and he did he did it was like rapid-fire
[58:56] I knew well whatever you doing just stop
[59:00] you know
[59:01] III never liked the things we're gonna
[59:04] have a talk when we get home stop the
[59:07] fellowship let's just go home right now
[59:09] let's get it over let's get it over I
[59:13] think that was worse than the whippin
[59:18] and look it takes stamina and strength
[59:21] because there's times and when we look
[59:23] at even in the correction of our
[59:25] children it's not just something that's
[59:27] a short sweet and simple thing you got
[59:29] to know why you're being corrected I
[59:31] mean does God just correct you and I on
[59:34] you and I don't know well what's going
[59:35] on Lord know he wants us to know so that
[59:40] as the Bible says in Hebrews 12 that we
[59:43] might then make straight paths for our
[59:46] feet that we might then have fruit that
[59:50] would come out of our life because we
[59:52] are exercised within that discipline
[59:54] that he has given to us so discipline is
[59:57] not just what takes place in the little
[59:59] room with the paddle or with the belt or
[1:00:01] you know however you you know address
[1:00:04] things or whatever more and I would say
[1:00:06] it like this however you're addressing
[1:00:07] it you make sure that you're consistent
[1:00:10] with it
[1:00:11] God is consistent are you with me
[1:00:14] if God said it back there he was against
[1:00:17] it back there he still against it today
[1:00:21] he's still the same God he's consistent
[1:00:25] with his word now I know things have
[1:00:29] changed and I don't know what revised
[1:00:31] version that is but I don't know
[1:00:33] anywhere I mean I haven't found any
[1:00:35] place where it says it in the word that
[1:00:37] you know that the the counting that
[1:00:42] bringeth that bring us wisdom to the
[1:00:44] child I think most everybody knows how
[1:00:48] to count are you with me be honest the
[1:00:53] people that you see count what do you
[1:00:56] see the result of Lord Jesus they try to
[1:01:06] make this a little bit I maybe I'll just
[1:01:08] say this right now brother Dave jr. is
[1:01:11] not here so I can say it now he ought to
[1:01:13] give me permission last year rather than
[1:01:16] junior you know when he was a little guy
[1:01:20] real small you know for the days you
[1:01:23] know took him out I think it was in a
[1:01:25] service and he took and he took him out
[1:01:27] and you know he was gonna spank him and
[1:01:29] he was letting him know you know what he
[1:01:31] did that was wrong and they were telling
[1:01:34] me about this last week and so I said I
[1:01:36] forgot I forgot y'all tell me do you
[1:01:37] mind if I use that sometimes go ahead
[1:01:39] well brother Dave was it there he was
[1:01:41] talking to him we're talking about
[1:01:42] sowing the word okay he was letting him
[1:01:45] know what he had done wrong he said now
[1:01:46] listen Dave he said you got anything
[1:01:48] else to say you got anything to say for
[1:01:50] yourself before that I spanked you he
[1:01:53] looked up at his dad he said I'm ready
[1:01:55] for the rapture
[1:01:56] [Laughter]
[1:02:08] hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
[1:02:09] that was being sown in him we're living
[1:02:12] in the time of the rapture he knew that
[1:02:14] the rapture was a time of escape so he
[1:02:18] had he had the principle right but he
[1:02:20] just was applying in him for a home but
[1:02:26] in reality it's just like even in the in
[1:02:28] the correction of things you know I
[1:02:31] would say that with a grandparents and
[1:02:33] things like this when we talk about the
[1:02:34] Dodie in this let me just break this in
[1:02:36] a little bit further into the message
[1:02:38] but it's even of how that you know a lot
[1:02:40] of things begin to break down and in
[1:02:42] life and things begin to change I found
[1:02:44] my dad more patient with things with my
[1:02:47] boys I never would have seen him that
[1:02:49] patient with me on it would have been
[1:02:51] correction you know when it's there
[1:02:53] before he's like uh-uh
[1:02:54] Pat just her cover letter and I find out
[1:02:58] about that years later and you know kind
[1:03:04] of say this what grace is this
[1:03:10] but you realize real grace brings
[1:03:16] results real grace is corrective you see
[1:03:24] brother BAM goes it and lays it out like
[1:03:26] this he said people try to make God some
[1:03:29] big old fat dhoti grandfather and he's
[1:03:32] got a bunch of grandkids
[1:03:34] he said Ricky's and Elvis's and there's
[1:03:36] no harm in them
[1:03:41] that is the biggest lie the Bible says
[1:03:45] that there is foolishness bound in their
[1:03:50] heart the sent like this there
[1:03:54] was foolishness bound in our heart and
[1:03:58] what did God do God drove out the
[1:04:02] foolishness by his word and when that is
[1:04:06] driven out of our life and he steps in
[1:04:08] place then you see things change he said
[1:04:14] but not God he has no grandchildren he's
[1:04:17] a father you've got to be born again you
[1:04:22] know you look at how that you know the
[1:04:24] influence of Satan even as it comes upon
[1:04:28] this age and it's been going down many
[1:04:30] things that you and I are seeing in this
[1:04:32] age they are seeds that have already
[1:04:35] been sown the Prophet would identify
[1:04:38] seeds but even things that the Prophet
[1:04:41] was catching in that time that was
[1:04:44] coming that the rest of them could not
[1:04:46] see you find that there are seeds for
[1:04:49] many things even relationships between
[1:04:51] man and woman
[1:04:52] there were many seeds that were sown
[1:04:54] even way back there in the very early
[1:04:56] parts of this nation coming about this
[1:05:05] is why the Prophet would give certain
[1:05:07] counsel and I believe he was led by God
[1:05:10] when they would make this statement you
[1:05:12] know has its made within the minds of
[1:05:14] the people God is a good God
[1:05:18] brother brems said I've heard that so
[1:05:19] much till I get sick well isn't it true
[1:05:26] he is a good god he is a good god but
[1:05:30] God is also a God of justice see that's
[1:05:36] an attribute of him now it's not an
[1:05:38] attribute that a lot of people like but
[1:05:40] it is an attribute of him and we
[1:05:43] understand it correctly
[1:05:44] first Corinthians 11 tells us that when
[1:05:47] we would fail to judge ourselves then we
[1:05:50] are judged of God that we would not be
[1:05:54] condemned with the world so God's
[1:05:58] judgment God's correction is not God
[1:06:01] that he's mad but it's God watching over
[1:06:05] his word and he knows where you and I
[1:06:08] are at he already knows their destiny he
[1:06:10] sees everything out before us and he's
[1:06:13] making sure that that pathway that you
[1:06:15] and I are to beyond that we're lined up
[1:06:17] and we're moving in that pathway
[1:06:19] God is faithful I'm gonna tell you God
[1:06:23] ain't somebody that comes in and turns
[1:06:25] his kids lose and don't know what
[1:06:26] they're doing God is not somebody who
[1:06:29] just turns his children lose and they
[1:06:32] don't know what he don't know what
[1:06:33] they're doing but the Bible says that
[1:06:34] the eyes of the Lord
[1:06:36] they roam to and fro as a matter of fact
[1:06:38] it says lo I am with you always you
[1:06:41] might say well brother Samuel even in
[1:06:43] this right here before God getting a
[1:06:45] hold of my life let me tell you
[1:06:47] something that light that would you and
[1:06:49] I see of the angel of the Lord the
[1:06:51] pillar fire do you realize that light
[1:06:53] followed brother Branham his whole life
[1:06:55] come on somebody even that that
[1:06:58] astrologer that mad drive when she
[1:07:00] pointed out there's a light following
[1:07:02] you is that right see God the Bible this
[1:07:06] is true this is scripture Psalms 27
[1:07:09] David said surely and mercy shall follow
[1:07:11] me all the days of my life
[1:07:13] that will phrase follow me means to
[1:07:15] chase after me I shall dwell in the
[1:07:18] house of the Lord forever
[1:07:21] it wasn't that you were faster in God
[1:07:24] but God knows exactly when he's gonna
[1:07:26] catch up with you he already knows
[1:07:29] everything is set in divinely plays God
[1:07:33] knows exactly when he's gonna catch up
[1:07:35] with you
[1:07:35] but that said he ain't no old Doty
[1:07:37] grandfather that can be pushed around
[1:07:39] and his grandkids don't have any sin
[1:07:44] he's a God of justice and holiness he
[1:07:48] proved it in the Garden of Eden by his
[1:07:50] first children look at this look at this
[1:07:52] this is something when we see how God
[1:07:55] reacted in the Garden of Eden he gave
[1:07:58] His Word when his children stepped over
[1:08:01] his word so what is first what is first
[1:08:03] the word so then the the disciplining
[1:08:07] that the chastening the correction it
[1:08:10] comes after the word has been stepped
[1:08:12] over so first of all it must be teaching
[1:08:17] of what is right what is acceptable are
[1:08:22] you with me you know it's when things
[1:08:27] that you see that that that something in
[1:08:30] action comes out or something comes out
[1:08:32] recognize when we see that action or
[1:08:35] that coming out that's a time to
[1:08:37] instruct and bring that and base that
[1:08:40] upon the word
[1:08:45] then if it's not heated to you follow
[1:08:49] through with it that's not you see the
[1:08:54] condition the influence of satan in this
[1:08:57] age let them find their own way that is
[1:09:00] satanic that is not of God whatsoever
[1:09:06] that's not a principle of God's Word
[1:09:09] God's desire he said law I'm with you
[1:09:12] always
[1:09:13] he's faithful to lead us and to guide us
[1:09:16] and and to direct us through in our life
[1:09:19] and I want you to think of this God has
[1:09:22] he has no grandchildren now I've
[1:09:27] referred you to this in many different
[1:09:29] times but I just want to refer to it
[1:09:30] today and not read it but remember when
[1:09:33] God makes himself known to to Jacob and
[1:09:37] and when Jacob comes to Bethel when he's
[1:09:40] leaving there the home of Isaac and
[1:09:42] Rebekah he comes then to Bethel and when
[1:09:45] he gets to Bethel there and here God
[1:09:48] appears to him that night listen to me
[1:09:51] he already had instruction in his home
[1:09:54] about the Lord he already had that so he
[1:09:59] wasn't it wasn't something to say whoa
[1:10:01] what in the world is this what's going
[1:10:02] on let me just pause here for a moment
[1:10:05] if one of my boys would have had to
[1:10:08] write a letter and put it on a tree
[1:10:12] then I failed as a parent let me just be
[1:10:17] very clear with this we have the
[1:10:20] testimony of the prophet of God where he
[1:10:23] said he said I didn't know how to talk
[1:10:25] to him so I wrote a letter and I put it
[1:10:28] on a tree I can understand that
[1:10:30] he didn't have that instruction but woe
[1:10:32] is us as parents if our children all
[1:10:35] right letters and said I don't know how
[1:10:37] to approach him it ought to be something
[1:10:39] they know how to approach him and it's
[1:10:41] not my word it's by that expression in
[1:10:43] our line they hear you pray they hear
[1:10:46] you're not just at the dinner table but
[1:10:47] they hear you pray you know what that is
[1:10:51] it isn't about a show but let me tell
[1:10:53] you something they need to have a
[1:10:54] security to know that daddy is the
[1:10:57] leader but as daddy being the leader
[1:10:59] he's being led by the greatest leader it
[1:11:03] brings comfort and stability in that
[1:11:05] home and the church said hallelujah it
[1:11:11] must be you know because of all we
[1:11:13] believe this you can't be a leader if
[1:11:15] you can't be led Alleluia so it's it's
[1:11:23] it's important to this then our children
[1:11:25] coming out of here
[1:11:27] it's not about tacking letters on the on
[1:11:28] on the tree remember the disciples said
[1:11:31] to him teach us how to pray you see God
[1:11:35] had become man this was God with skin on
[1:11:38] it teach us how to pray teach us how to
[1:11:43] pray let us hear how to approach so that
[1:11:45] you can recognize that here you talk to
[1:11:48] him as you talk to me hallelujah you can
[1:11:53] tell him your heart you got things on
[1:11:55] your heart tell him the things on your
[1:11:56] heart if you trouble tell him about
[1:11:59] those things you see because Satan in
[1:12:02] the beginning God had revealed himself
[1:12:05] as Lord God but when Satan came quoting
[1:12:08] the word
[1:12:09] he never said Lord God he said God said
[1:12:11] a far-off one who doesn't understand you
[1:12:14] but God had already reeled himself as
[1:12:15] Lord God meaning Jehovah one who exists
[1:12:19] with his family he's a high priest that
[1:12:22] can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:12:24] infirmities
[1:12:26] you know that says he's sensitive he's
[1:12:29] watching his children's watching thing
[1:12:32] maybe their tone and how things are
[1:12:33] going
[1:12:33] he's sensitive the Bible says that the
[1:12:37] spirit him maketh intercession for our
[1:12:40] weaknesses he's attentive hallelujah Oh
[1:12:45] glory be to God hallelujah so it's
[1:12:49] that's why I say as a parent it requires
[1:12:52] an attentiveness he requires that no not
[1:12:58] nothing not an oblivia but it
[1:12:59] attentiveness my
[1:13:13] so through the scriptures I'll just I
[1:13:15] have these in the notes but I'm not
[1:13:17] gonna I don't want to read him overhead
[1:13:18] I just refer to him when God made
[1:13:20] himself known to Jacob and also then
[1:13:24] again when he made himself known even to
[1:13:29] Isaac and as God would even speak to
[1:13:32] Jacob when he spoke to Moses I want you
[1:13:35] to notice each time God would let it be
[1:13:37] known that I am the Lord God of Abraham
[1:13:40] thy father Jacob was his grandchild in
[1:13:45] the flesh but God was letting him know
[1:13:50] Abraham is your father that spiritual
[1:13:55] revelation that has been given to
[1:13:58] Abraham you know he's letting you know
[1:14:00] he says you're not just flesh you're not
[1:14:03] just a child of the flesh of the Prophet
[1:14:05] but your eyes spiritual child of the
[1:14:09] word that is the Prophet you see he's
[1:14:13] letting them know I am your father it's
[1:14:15] not something ii handed but it is
[1:14:17] personal that i am still the same
[1:14:19] yesterday today forever
[1:14:21] you know what god is saying that he is
[1:14:23] our father and by not that he's not a
[1:14:25] grandfather he's letting it be known my
[1:14:27] power my stamina my strength is still
[1:14:31] the same it's still the same I'm still
[1:14:35] in position to raise my youngins I'm
[1:14:39] still in position to bring forth my
[1:14:42] children in this age I'm still in
[1:14:44] position to bring them to full maturity
[1:14:46] I'm in position
[1:14:48] to nurture them and admonish them and
[1:14:51] bring fully the potentials that I see in
[1:14:54] their lives to past I have that strength
[1:14:57] it's the same power this was where
[1:15:06] brother Branham would say is your life
[1:15:08] worthy of the gospel I referred to this
[1:15:10] last week but he's talking you know
[1:15:14] about grandparents and he says you know
[1:15:18] I think we can really appreciate our
[1:15:20] grandchildren
[1:15:22] you said I hope this don't sound bad but
[1:15:25] we can have more time with them I
[1:15:26] believe than we did with our children
[1:15:31] and I could preach on this the rest of
[1:15:33] the week's just that statement this is
[1:15:37] not an exemption and saying parents are
[1:15:41] too busy that's not what he's speaking
[1:15:43] about you and I both know there's things
[1:15:45] you know what there's a certain bedtime
[1:15:47] right there's things you gotta give me
[1:15:48] you can't just stay up to whenever more
[1:15:50] as a parent there's things you're
[1:15:51] looking at there's there's timelines
[1:15:52] that you said there's certain things hey
[1:15:54] I've got to be up to next morning and we
[1:15:56] got to do this at this time do this this
[1:15:58] time and yet at the same time making a
[1:15:59] window for a relationship but a
[1:16:02] grandparent wake up have their coffee
[1:16:10] they want to take in that they can take
[1:16:13] a nap hey they earned it
[1:16:14] they earned it how many times over the
[1:16:19] years I've committed to the different
[1:16:20] brothers and sisters have been retired
[1:16:22] and actually actually enjoyed it not
[1:16:25] have I have I spoke to them individually
[1:16:27] said you know what it's been a good
[1:16:28] example it really has been because then
[1:16:33] of what you know in your life you're
[1:16:35] able to spend and have more time with
[1:16:38] them I believe than what we did with our
[1:16:40] own children you know everything is not
[1:16:43] rushed you know I mean is not rush
[1:16:46] you're not looking at like as long as
[1:16:47] this game going I don't know right now I
[1:16:51] haven't been bankrupt on the board all
[1:16:52] my hotels are covered oh man this close
[1:16:55] to bedtime half hour how do I
[1:17:01] the brim said I asked the wife that the
[1:17:03] other day and she said well sure you
[1:17:06] loved them a little while turn them back
[1:17:08] over to their mother and go on
[1:17:11] grandparents have a have a quick refresh
[1:17:13] button come over M&Ms in their son what
[1:17:19] kind you want a peanut peanut caramel
[1:17:22] which one you want and then we got this
[1:17:23] over here and then all of a sudden Oh
[1:17:27] mom and daddy coming but you see true
[1:17:40] you get to turn them back to who who is
[1:17:44] really belong that god holds responsible
[1:17:49] and is trusted this too so when you feel
[1:17:53] overwhelmed because you do there are
[1:17:56] many times as a parent you feel
[1:17:58] overwhelmed even as it progresses
[1:18:01] through life because of everything that
[1:18:02] you have going on well if you're not
[1:18:04] gonna say a man I'm just gonna Amen
[1:18:06] because it's absolutely the truth
[1:18:08] sometimes you wonder how can you get
[1:18:11] everything in my I got it I end up
[1:18:16] reading having you all here for a long
[1:18:18] time I gotta stay within the context of
[1:18:21] things here he's good in me but you see
[1:18:25] there's things that it does and I want
[1:18:28] to just encourage you that you're not
[1:18:30] abnormal it isn't that you don't love
[1:18:32] your children but it's recognizing that
[1:18:35] you're letting remember the Lord is
[1:18:37] first this was overcoming the Lord is
[1:18:39] first your family is second and your
[1:18:42] last don't get the two mixed up don't
[1:18:48] put your family ahead of God because
[1:18:54] it'll never come out right put golf
[1:18:56] first family second your last
[1:18:59] that's overcoming now within that we can
[1:19:05] look at and see within that of that of
[1:19:08] the children that there are times that
[1:19:10] said we get down we get weary and things
[1:19:13] come along there's even some things
[1:19:15] you'll face certain things and you're
[1:19:16] dealing with certain things even when
[1:19:18] they would come into certain years and
[1:19:19] certain times but even when they're
[1:19:21] little sometimes there's things and
[1:19:23] you're applying the word listen friends
[1:19:25] every time you applied the word you
[1:19:27] cannot look at yourself or I can't look
[1:19:29] at myself as though I'm free from fault
[1:19:33] as though the word has some error in it
[1:19:35] we're just a producing that word will
[1:19:39] produce yes sir every word is a seed of
[1:19:46] God when it's planted in the right
[1:19:51] ground it'll bring forth so I can look
[1:19:55] at it and say Lord there's nothing wrong
[1:19:57] with your word nothing wrong with you
[1:19:59] but help me to understand how to apply
[1:20:02] it that doesn't stop that goes across
[1:20:07] the board so these things you can look
[1:20:12] up and ask God and say Lord help me Lord
[1:20:17] give me strength the Lord guide me Lord
[1:20:21] direct me Lord do you think Noah didn't
[1:20:23] have no prayer meetings Noah was a
[1:20:26] praying man that's how God even
[1:20:27] communicated with him I believe with all
[1:20:30] my heart that Noah there are times Noah
[1:20:32] had the plan before him but I believe
[1:20:34] there was sometimes no and say Lord it
[1:20:36] just it's just it's just getting so hard
[1:20:39] Lord and it bringing these this wood in
[1:20:42] here in the pitch and Lord we're just
[1:20:44] warned maybe God told him and said well
[1:20:48] just take a day and rest but God there's
[1:20:51] an impending judgment Noah I'm the one
[1:20:55] who told you take a day arrest the Lord
[1:20:59] Jesus here to serve the greatest purpose
[1:21:03] of all time he said to his disciples let
[1:21:06] us come aside and rest because why this
[1:21:12] guy still needs rest and this guy
[1:21:16] needing rest it isn't just this hunk of
[1:21:18] flesh it's your mind and your emotional
[1:21:21] makeup
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:32] you're loving
[1:21:36] nor prey but you see what Noah did as he
[1:21:41] would pray then what's he doing he's
[1:21:44] turning it over to the Lord see it's
[1:21:46] become such a strain brother Brent
[1:21:49] called it like that a strain but he was
[1:21:51] placing it back into the hands of the
[1:21:53] Lord
[1:21:53] how was he doing that by putting himself
[1:21:55] into the hands of the Lord Lord I'm in
[1:21:59] your hands this is your message that
[1:22:01] you've given me
[1:22:02] I'm your messenger but Lord you're the
[1:22:04] one you've got to give me the strength
[1:22:06] Lord the responsibility you place on my
[1:22:09] shoulders for this age God I need your
[1:22:11] strength and he said I am your father
[1:22:14] my strength is just the same as when I
[1:22:18] gave you this word my strength is just
[1:22:20] as strong let me tell you something the
[1:22:23] same God who got a hold of your life and
[1:22:25] birth your soul he has just as much
[1:22:29] power and it's residing within you this
[1:22:32] morning that situations can be turned
[1:22:37] around yes sir so here this stamina of
[1:22:44] strength because there's a a
[1:22:45] commissioning in Genesis 18:19 there's a
[1:22:50] commission we looked at that last week
[1:22:52] where God commissioned Abraham how he
[1:22:55] will command his children in his
[1:22:56] household after him that they shall keep
[1:22:58] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[1:23:00] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[1:23:02] Abraham that which he has spoken of him
[1:23:07] you don't know and I don't know we don't
[1:23:10] know the joy huh I believe that I'm
[1:23:13] gonna be alive to see the change I
[1:23:15] believe that but if I'm not and I go by
[1:23:22] the way of the grief my heart's desire
[1:23:25] is that this church would not miss one
[1:23:29] step and my desire is that the children
[1:23:34] my children wouldn't miss one step are
[1:23:39] you with me we don't have the promise of
[1:23:42] other love another day or another time
[1:23:44] you say what are you saying by that I'm
[1:23:46] saying that we must by the promise that
[1:23:50] is given in this hour we must sow the
[1:23:53] word
[1:23:54] living that word expressing that word
[1:23:56] letting it be an absolute in our lives
[1:23:59] in our homes in everything and letting
[1:24:02] it bid direction to where our children
[1:24:05] the rapture itself is not just a term
[1:24:07] that is heard but it is a term that's
[1:24:10] expressed its taught hallelujah I
[1:24:20] believe that with all my heart we
[1:24:22] innocent God's children are aware of the
[1:24:25] promise of the age you see we're not we
[1:24:29] recognize every one of the children that
[1:24:31] lived down through time they were
[1:24:33] looking Paul said though though though
[1:24:35] though though though we are alive and
[1:24:38] remain we shall be changed Paul didn't
[1:24:41] believe that he was gonna die he
[1:24:44] believed that the coming of the Lord was
[1:24:46] imminent when Martin preached he
[1:24:50] preached the coming of the Lord is
[1:24:51] imminent why because the Lord had come
[1:24:54] in them and made them ready for his
[1:24:57] coming in corporal body and it was
[1:25:00] something within them when that Spirit
[1:25:02] of God moves on the inside you then
[1:25:04] realize I'm not of this world I am a
[1:25:08] pilgrim I am a stranger here this is not
[1:25:12] my home but I'm looking for a city
[1:25:18] whose builder and maker is God you see
[1:25:23] what is that that still the effect of
[1:25:25] that word being lived out he shall
[1:25:27] command his household after him a word
[1:25:32] that's been given and the Holy Spirit
[1:25:34] will always do what come to the word is
[1:25:37] that right you want the way you want the
[1:25:40] Holy Spirit to come in the meeting let
[1:25:41] the word be preached the Holy Spirit
[1:25:44] will come into the word because the word
[1:25:46] is the conduit that the Spirit will
[1:25:48] travel in so the preaching of the word
[1:25:52] it is a releasing of the Spirit of God
[1:25:56] to work this is why that the Holy Ghost
[1:25:58] could no longer work in the church
[1:26:01] because they had its own with creeds and
[1:26:03] dogmas they bound the working of the
[1:26:06] Holy Ghost
[1:26:07] but God in the end time has loosened and
[1:26:11] broken those Creed's and dogmas from
[1:26:15] around your heart because there was a
[1:26:17] longing in your heart for a reality that
[1:26:20] was already something that was within
[1:26:22] you and God put that longing within you
[1:26:25] a deep calls to the deep but only he
[1:26:27] could satisfy and because that word has
[1:26:31] been released we don't have just a
[1:26:33] portion we don't have just a second step
[1:26:35] of grace we don't even have just a third
[1:26:38] stage of grace but it's a very foolish
[1:26:40] of Christ himself
[1:26:42] moving into the body it's the word that
[1:26:46] is the conduit for the Holy Spirit to
[1:26:50] move in so that brings the place sewing
[1:26:54] the word is important stamina so the
[1:27:01] stamina of strength it weakens with age
[1:27:04] whether you like it or not I'm not
[1:27:09] called nobody's name in here but I know
[1:27:11] there's some of you know a little bit
[1:27:12] older man you strongman and you got a
[1:27:15] lot of stamina a lot of strength in one
[1:27:17] or more but you don't tell nobody how
[1:27:18] many naps you take I won't call nobody's
[1:27:22] name in here
[1:27:29] yeah ain't it funny when your little man
[1:27:31] mom and dad made you take take a nap
[1:27:34] yeah I'm missing playtime now I wish
[1:27:37] somebody make me take a nap you're gonna
[1:27:44] have mercy but I want you to watch how
[1:27:46] brother branham place is this you're our
[1:27:48] stamina weakens with age and not just
[1:27:50] our stamina our nerves too
[1:27:59] whoo imma let that soak a little bit
[1:28:04] little bantam talked about he said now
[1:28:06] tonight he said I'm one time he said I
[1:28:08] stood in this pulpit like a little boy
[1:28:10] this flashing red lights was coming he
[1:28:12] said I stood in this pulpit like a
[1:28:13] little boy said but tonight I'm an old
[1:28:15] gray and hair and all headed in stooping
[1:28:17] shoulders I'm broke down he said my
[1:28:20] life's running out threads are getting
[1:28:22] brittle so I move on down the stream my
[1:28:27] friends get fewer after why I said I
[1:28:33] come to a place that after a while let's
[1:28:34] look at this I'll come to a place maybe
[1:28:38] that I won't enjoy the songs like I used
[1:28:41] to
[1:28:47] and maybe my grandchildren the children
[1:28:50] will have to say don't make grandpa
[1:28:52] nervous it may come to that if I live
[1:29:01] I wish right now if you're a grandma or
[1:29:03] grandpa I wish you just take that
[1:29:04] spiritual fist and just put it right in
[1:29:07] the devil's mouth when he's tried to
[1:29:09] tell you that Oh your nerves are this or
[1:29:12] that you're a hotter this is this going
[1:29:14] on he's not the interpreter of the word
[1:29:18] you take that you take that fist GRA se
[1:29:24] and pow hit him right in the mouth it
[1:29:30] doesn't mean that you have a license
[1:29:33] like see brother branham even talked
[1:29:35] about this uniting time aside he said Oh
[1:29:36] God
[1:29:37] if I live to be a certain certain age
[1:29:39] lord don't don't let me be crowned with
[1:29:42] a a cantankerous spirit see he was
[1:29:48] praying for that Lord don't let me be
[1:29:51] crowned with that why he knew that there
[1:29:53] would be susceptibilities within life
[1:29:55] it's just like when you get old or
[1:29:57] something happens in your immunity in
[1:29:59] your system you become susceptible to
[1:30:01] things but all within that the same God
[1:30:04] all along that has kept you it kept me
[1:30:07] that same God will be faithful right
[1:30:09] there yes sir I think God for these
[1:30:14] statements like this hallelujah Oh II
[1:30:19] said it may come to that if if I live I
[1:30:22] oh my I'm gonna have to come down here
[1:30:26] and I'm not even getting to where I want
[1:30:27] to get to second Timothy you know
[1:30:30] remember Paul he talked about to Timothy
[1:30:36] and he talked about stirring up the
[1:30:39] faith and he says in verse 5 of 2nd
[1:30:42] Timothy 1 when I call to remember it's
[1:30:44] the unfeigned faith that is indeed which
[1:30:47] dwelt first in that grandmother Lois and
[1:30:52] thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded
[1:30:55] that in thee also
[1:31:01] perhaps because you and I can testify to
[1:31:05] this we don't always see it in ourselves
[1:31:11] like others can see it we don't see it
[1:31:15] like God sees it and there's a good part
[1:31:18] to that in one way because we never want
[1:31:22] to just be complacent we want to keep
[1:31:26] reaching forward we want to keep
[1:31:29] pressing but I believe that it is very
[1:31:33] important and God knows it's very
[1:31:36] important that you and I that our what
[1:31:40] the development of what he's working in
[1:31:42] our life that that would be something
[1:31:44] that you and I can see in our lives and
[1:31:47] say I am growing I am growing I am
[1:31:52] changing there are things happening in
[1:31:55] my life there are you know why that's
[1:31:57] building faith not in you but in him and
[1:32:03] his faith is built in him what is faith
[1:32:07] it's trust so it allows you and opens
[1:32:11] you to yield more to his plan that more
[1:32:14] growth might come and that's all because
[1:32:20] he's right there with you so here do you
[1:32:25] learn Timothy no what I knew to be in
[1:32:28] your grandmother what I knew to be in
[1:32:30] your mother I'm persuaded it's in you
[1:32:33] can I preach a little bit I believe the
[1:32:36] Holy Ghost lets you and I know in this
[1:32:38] hour what the Prophet made known to us
[1:32:40] when he said what God has done for the
[1:32:43] church agent messenger he desires to do
[1:32:45] the same thing for each and every one of
[1:32:48] his children he said we have that access
[1:32:50] to that authority and to that power I
[1:32:53] believe that God had a had a
[1:32:55] representation of a son coming to
[1:32:56] maturity in this hour but I believe that
[1:32:59] that was for you and I to recognize that
[1:33:02] the same God who gave the word
[1:33:05] and who moved within the prophet's life
[1:33:06] and how the Prophet yielded himself to
[1:33:09] the molding of the Spirit of God through
[1:33:11] that word it will also and it is
[1:33:14] producing a bride for Jesus Christ but
[1:33:17] that same characteristic that was
[1:33:19] ministered demonstrated and put before
[1:33:21] the people is also taking flesh in the
[1:33:24] hearts of God's children and that word
[1:33:28] must be ministered and it encourages our
[1:33:32] hearts and lets us know this what's
[1:33:35] belongs to you as arrows are in the hand
[1:33:45] of a mighty man so our children of the
[1:33:48] youth
[1:33:56] gonna be about hunting time in it glory
[1:34:04] be to God now that was just my
[1:34:08] foundation I'm gonna start preaching now
[1:34:18] but I ain't gonna be able to reach you
[1:34:20] for a little bit and I think God god
[1:34:22] knows what we need but I want to just
[1:34:23] kind of drop this in a little bit and
[1:34:25] this is what I want to start I'm there's
[1:34:27] no way that I can even fully I'm not
[1:34:28] even be able to fully cover this in one
[1:34:31] service at all but as an arrow the Bible
[1:34:35] says that the children are as arrows now
[1:34:40] you know an arrow there's four parts to
[1:34:42] it you look at this day all that's an
[1:34:45] arrow but there's four parts to it
[1:34:47] there's the shaft which is this this
[1:34:50] right here
[1:34:51] then there's the fletching then there's
[1:34:54] the knock then you have the place so
[1:35:00] that the point can be put on there
[1:35:03] there's four stages to life right
[1:35:06] there's four parts now you look at this
[1:35:10] you look at this shaft here this is
[1:35:11] something is very very important the
[1:35:14] shaft itself when you recognize this in
[1:35:17] that' in that of a shaft
[1:35:20] you can have the greatest point in the
[1:35:23] world this is just a field point for
[1:35:25] target shooting but you can have the
[1:35:27] greatest sharpest blade on here I mean
[1:35:32] it can be sharp but if this shaft cannot
[1:35:38] take a transfer of power they don't
[1:35:41] matter how sharp this is if no matter
[1:35:47] how much the fletching that's placed on
[1:35:49] it to give it the right spin if the
[1:35:52] shaft is not able to take and move the
[1:35:57] distance no matter how good the
[1:35:59] fletching is it won't make it even maybe
[1:36:05] the nock you know you might have a
[1:36:07] lighted nock like they have now you know
[1:36:08] you can shoot it in watch your red dot
[1:36:10] go you know doesn't matter if the shaft
[1:36:14] itself is not right then the rest of it
[1:36:19] you could have everything else on it
[1:36:22] leather doeskin seats and you can have
[1:36:26] all those things you know you could have
[1:36:27] all everything just just right but I
[1:36:28] this all I want you to look at here and
[1:36:31] I want to just kind of just slow this
[1:36:32] down a little bit this deals and I want
[1:36:34] to just focus on this part here just
[1:36:36] just a moment just this right here this
[1:36:38] part now you know there's different
[1:36:41] types of arrows this isn't a this isn't
[1:36:44] a hunting club there's different types
[1:36:46] of arrows this is a carbon arrow I'll
[1:36:49] shoot this thing this ain't one that
[1:36:51] I've shot because they don't have dirt
[1:36:53] on it but I can shoot this thing and
[1:36:56] shoot it over again it's a carbon arrow
[1:36:58] but you know the aluminum arrows they'll
[1:36:59] Bend the wooden ones sometimes the
[1:37:02] wooden ones will snap right so the
[1:37:05] carbon one you know it it has something
[1:37:07] within it and the way that this arrow is
[1:37:09] made the arrow is made because there has
[1:37:11] to be a middle part right here that's
[1:37:12] flexible this part needs to be rigid to
[1:37:16] stay straight
[1:37:17] this part back here has to also be a
[1:37:19] more rigid in order to take the impact
[1:37:22] and the push so there's four parts here
[1:37:26] to this arrow and this part right here
[1:37:28] on the shaft I'm just gonna say it like
[1:37:29] this this one when they take this arrow
[1:37:32] you know and I went to get these arrows
[1:37:33] they put these parts in and right now I
[1:37:37] can't run what that's called
[1:37:38] your mother's called Bejoy that little
[1:37:39] part goes in there but anyhow you know
[1:37:42] the arrows when I went and bought these
[1:37:44] arrows these arrows were about this long
[1:37:46] now you say what in the world happened
[1:37:48] well I had to take him up to the counter
[1:37:51] and they put me in a bow and I had to
[1:37:53] pull that bow back and when I pulled it
[1:37:55] back
[1:37:55] they cut the shaft based on my draw
[1:38:00] length so you see the shaft of the arrow
[1:38:05] is from the genes of mama and papa
[1:38:09] come on somebody or hey stick with me we
[1:38:14] work this right in the spiritual because
[1:38:15] if it comes right back and forth but you
[1:38:18] see it was based on it's based on a draw
[1:38:20] length and then they would cut that and
[1:38:21] they make a cut so that they've got
[1:38:23] everything figured in with that cut so
[1:38:25] that the point can go on there
[1:38:27] everything with the nock the fletching
[1:38:28] all that stuff is placed there but you
[1:38:30] see what this shaft is it's the identity
[1:38:33] there's three parts the identity of a
[1:38:36] child this age I know they tried to
[1:38:39] confuse him and say well you know you
[1:38:41] might be a boy but you're a girl no
[1:38:43] there is a true sexual identity God made
[1:38:48] male and female and I'm going to tell
[1:38:53] you if you just try to put that stuff on
[1:38:55] autopilot let me tell you this that
[1:38:57] stuff is going on out there it's going
[1:39:00] on in the schools it's going on in the
[1:39:02] colleges on and on and on yes this is
[1:39:07] not a time for autopilot this is a time
[1:39:10] for hands-on this is a time that's not
[1:39:14] just it's a boy I mean you know y'all
[1:39:17] annoys a boy these are things to also
[1:39:19] cultivate that
[1:39:26] it's also very important that the child
[1:39:29] even know their their emotional identity
[1:39:37] because you know you other you have one
[1:39:39] child or you have two child 3 child for
[1:39:41] whatever more they're not carbon copies
[1:39:44] one of another the way you approach the
[1:39:48] one you have to approach the other one a
[1:39:50] little different she's still the same
[1:39:53] word it's the approach Oh brother Samuel
[1:39:58] God he changes not ooh you want some
[1:40:00] examples on this remember brother Billy
[1:40:03] Paul sitting in the office brother BAM
[1:40:05] took one to bury Billy ran took a
[1:40:06] direction with a certain one and then
[1:40:08] brother Bremen he took his direction
[1:40:09] over here and brother Billy Paul was
[1:40:11] wondering what no world's he doing but
[1:40:13] to see he knew the motif that was behind
[1:40:15] it this is where the scripture or the
[1:40:18] Prophet says apply the token with love
[1:40:20] and consideration consideration means
[1:40:23] looking to the motive behind it so it's
[1:40:26] understanding being attentive to those
[1:40:27] things furthermore we all recognize that
[1:40:31] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is not
[1:40:34] speaking in tongues is that right
[1:40:36] our sister comes to brother Branham says
[1:40:38] brother Branham would you ask God to let
[1:40:40] me speak in tongues so I know I got the
[1:40:42] Holy Ghost brother brems as a fine
[1:40:44] dandies sister that's already filled
[1:40:46] with the Spirit of God he said but we
[1:40:48] prayed and asked God to let her speak in
[1:40:49] tongues so she knows she has it you
[1:40:53] understand God under God knows those
[1:40:55] things he knows the makeup and brother
[1:40:57] Branham in that part question answer 64
[1:40:59] if you read further in that quote he
[1:41:01] goes with even how that the devil will
[1:41:03] work and come at you and attack you on
[1:41:05] your makeup I don't have time to cover
[1:41:10] all of that today but he he works within
[1:41:13] that so it's very important in this hour
[1:41:16] it's understanding those things of even
[1:41:18] that of the makeup and the emotional
[1:41:21] makeup and as well the true spiritual
[1:41:24] identity
[1:41:27] but both Simon I don't know if there'll
[1:41:30] exeed or not shame on you
[1:41:34] shame on you video you would even say
[1:41:36] something like that you raise them and
[1:41:39] you show that word in them and let God
[1:41:42] produce it because it is up to you to
[1:41:45] determine whether they are whether they
[1:41:48] aren't that's the same way it comes in
[1:41:50] witnessing it's not about I don't know
[1:41:52] if they're elected or not I don't know
[1:41:54] the Knitting about that it's about
[1:41:55] sharing the gospel as God moves on your
[1:41:59] heart hey man it's a spiritual identity
[1:42:04] we know who we are in this household we
[1:42:06] are message believers we are children of
[1:42:09] God the token is applied this is what
[1:42:12] the token is not just what I say but the
[1:42:14] life that's lived spiritual identity he
[1:42:20] was God silent on this not at all not at
[1:42:23] all God let Israel know you're a chosen
[1:42:27] people I've chosen you you're a special
[1:42:32] people if you obey my word you're being
[1:42:35] to me a a peculiar treasure above all
[1:42:37] the peoples of the earth hallelujah
[1:42:43] God's God is faithful to his word to
[1:42:46] bring that force in our life think about
[1:42:48] it does God hold back from you your
[1:42:50] identity not at all as a matter of fact
[1:42:53] God has labored within this place to let
[1:42:57] you know he knew you before the
[1:43:00] foundation of the world he chose you in
[1:43:05] Christ before there was Adam Stardust or
[1:43:09] molecule you are always his even that
[1:43:15] God would make such bold declarations in
[1:43:19] this hour in the message future hold you
[1:43:22] weren't always saved but you must come
[1:43:28] into that experience you see God's not
[1:43:30] working on a maybe well I'll come to
[1:43:33] your earth and I'll die and maybe
[1:43:35] somebody will feel sorry for me let me
[1:43:37] tell you something he's God are you
[1:43:39] that and if we're sons and daughters of
[1:43:41] God let us operate with that same genus
[1:43:44] of power and authority we recognize who
[1:43:48] we are we recognize as the children of
[1:43:50] God
[1:43:50] and to know that we're not here by
[1:43:52] accident it's not by accident that God
[1:43:55] called you in this hour it's not by
[1:43:57] accident that God would give you a
[1:43:59] family in this hour and raise those
[1:44:01] children in this hour it's not by
[1:44:03] accident that your paths cross or with
[1:44:05] your grandchildren it's not by accident
[1:44:06] you look at every one of those moments
[1:44:09] whether you've got them in a deer stand
[1:44:10] whether you've got them in a sawing
[1:44:12] machine
[1:44:12] wherever it is you recognize these are
[1:44:15] moments and parts right here that the
[1:44:17] word can be sown it's valuable time how
[1:44:26] do you know that little fella or that
[1:44:28] little girl might not be that little
[1:44:30] fella might be a preacher he might be a
[1:44:32] deacon he might be he'd only have to be
[1:44:33] that he's just gonna be a real mighty
[1:44:36] warrior of God oh he might never be in
[1:44:39] front anybody he just might be behind
[1:44:40] the curtain praying come on somebody
[1:44:43] because you gotta have mighty warriors
[1:44:47] hey man it's a body ministry we're not a
[1:44:55] bunch of teenagers where we have our
[1:44:57] I've done but this is my room this is my
[1:44:59] domain nobody does anything in here this
[1:45:01] is just my domain I don't need the
[1:45:03] restaurant we're not a bunch of
[1:45:04] spiritual teenagers we know we are a
[1:45:07] body and we need one another the
[1:45:13] maturity of the gospel breaks down
[1:45:16] divisions who it's your your jeans so I
[1:45:25] mean right now say Lord Jesus my jeans
[1:45:30] my jeans
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:41] you know brother Ben I'm gonna say it
[1:45:43] like this he said you know how many of
[1:45:45] you stepped in you know and he talks
[1:45:47] about he and me to stepping in he said
[1:45:49] they'd look at you know a little Joseph
[1:45:52] laying there
[1:45:53] they said meet he look and see Bill he's
[1:45:56] got your high forehead he said I look at
[1:46:00] her say meaty but he's got your big eyes
[1:46:04] he said we sit there and look over say
[1:46:06] my you know he's because that's a
[1:46:08] product of our union whoo how the Lord
[1:46:14] looks upon our life and the angels of
[1:46:18] God said looking more like looking more
[1:46:23] like you I mean they're acting like they
[1:46:28] even rest like you rest
[1:46:34] hallelujah you see it comes more and
[1:46:36] more into his image and into his
[1:46:38] likeness now listen this is brother
[1:46:44] samia's opinion don't nobody get
[1:46:45] offended I think it's about the dumbest
[1:46:47] thing in the world somebody looking at a
[1:46:49] little infant that's born they look just
[1:46:51] like grandma also and so they look just
[1:46:53] like how Norrell do you know that little
[1:46:56] pudgy pink flesh they look just like
[1:47:01] something now you might be able to pick
[1:47:03] out nose and ears come on somebody
[1:47:07] now don't get offended don't get your
[1:47:09] feelings all hurt you know I love you
[1:47:12] but honestly how many times you look at
[1:47:15] things like that and in reality you know
[1:47:17] and you got people say you know they
[1:47:19] look just like so-and-so really really
[1:47:24] they look just like so and then you see
[1:47:27] him after a period of time
[1:47:30] I always knew they looked like uncle
[1:47:32] so-and-so well then why did you tell
[1:47:35] that line said it look like Grandma you
[1:47:40] some people just want them to look like
[1:47:41] somebody you know what I mean
[1:47:42] they don't look at house like that
[1:47:45] family but oh they look exactly like
[1:47:46] that family your wishful thinking don't
[1:47:48] make that you know they look exactly
[1:47:52] like Browning's your wishful thinking
[1:47:54] don't make that anybody wanted we
[1:47:58] wishful thinking it looked like
[1:47:59] Browning's but I'm just just saying you
[1:48:01] you put your last name in it as well
[1:48:02] okay
[1:48:03] might look just exactly there's a pride
[1:48:06] to that you know and it's nothing wrong
[1:48:08] with it I think that a young lady she
[1:48:11] are a married woman she wants to have
[1:48:14] that child it has a favour of that
[1:48:16] husband because it shows he's a daddy
[1:48:20] it shows you there's a little bit of
[1:48:24] that you see that those things coming
[1:48:26] through but then there's things a little
[1:48:27] bit later on you say oh dear Jesus what
[1:48:30] their Lord in order to overcome this
[1:48:36] Lord father I pray bring their birth
[1:48:38] early and I know it sounds a little
[1:48:41] funny but the reality is is you know in
[1:48:44] your own life that you have to die daily
[1:48:47] and you know you had to receive a
[1:48:49] greater power to put down and override
[1:48:54] your own makeup and God looks upon us in
[1:49:01] this hour they're looking more and more
[1:49:10] you know David David talks about this in
[1:49:13] Psalms 39 I'm not gonna read it let's
[1:49:15] stand we'll just stop here we'll just
[1:49:19] stop
[1:49:21] I don't I don't wanna I don't want to
[1:49:25] give you too much say you might say you
[1:49:30] don't seem like you ever stopped early
[1:49:32] any other time but this isn't exactly
[1:49:34] any early but maybe I just had a little
[1:49:35] bit of compassion in my heart today but
[1:49:42] I I trust that you listen friends don't
[1:49:46] don't don't take these services to where
[1:49:51] you get down and you look down on
[1:49:52] yourself that's not what the Word of God
[1:49:54] is about nope remember it's about sowing
[1:49:59] good seed it's not about ignoring it
[1:50:00] it's about asking God to help us and I'm
[1:50:03] saying this right here I'm not just
[1:50:05] preach these things to you neither do I
[1:50:07] just tell you these things these are
[1:50:09] things not only about the experience for
[1:50:11] things I am experiencing and I have to
[1:50:14] pray and I have to look to God just as
[1:50:18] you do and I encourage you when you feel
[1:50:21] overwhelmed when you feel like I just
[1:50:23] don't know exactly what to do i Lord I'm
[1:50:26] filling my stamina and yet here I am I'm
[1:50:29] in the place Lord where the children are
[1:50:31] to be raised then ask God for strength
[1:50:34] don't follow temptation to just release
[1:50:37] things because I'm gonna tell you if god
[1:50:41] Terry sometimes these thoughts sometimes
[1:50:43] these thoughts hit me I don't know maybe
[1:50:44] they don't hit nobody else but sometimes
[1:50:46] they hit me and I think you know
[1:50:47] sometimes when our boys have been away
[1:50:49] at a youth meeting now sir
[1:50:57] man I just missed I miss um being there
[1:51:01] I miss I miss them being there sitting
[1:51:05] down and talking and you look at a man
[1:51:08] when they're when they're coming back
[1:51:09] now mama looks at in a different little
[1:51:10] different way mama also you know I
[1:51:12] wonder what they're doing away well if
[1:51:15] they missed this meal don't get make
[1:51:17] sure they get it the next time but I I'm
[1:51:20] looking at a minute
[1:51:21] is it because this is my household I
[1:51:24] sold it in the pictures and that drywall
[1:51:26] this is my house for my family I said Oh
[1:51:29] Lord you know and I look at it sometimes
[1:51:32] and I realize if God Terry's lord have
[1:51:36] mercy if the Lord tarries in Iraq that
[1:51:39] we might be empty nesters I look at that
[1:51:42] and I ain't even thinking about that
[1:51:44] right now
[1:51:44] I'm so focused right here land I live on
[1:51:50] ain't big enough to build three houses
[1:51:52] but you understand what I'm saying
[1:52:01] it's let God in this time in the season
[1:52:03] of your life I understand there's times
[1:52:05] you know sometimes as a sometimes when
[1:52:10] situations when I've ministered and
[1:52:12] sometimes been in other assemblies and
[1:52:14] things and sometimes my wife's been able
[1:52:16] to talk with some it just the way things
[1:52:17] have appointed itself sometimes a you
[1:52:21] know a mama a new mama or sometimes
[1:52:23] maybe she's the second child or whatever
[1:52:25] more she was used to having the time
[1:52:28] where she just got away and you know she
[1:52:31] just had a time to sit down and listen
[1:52:32] to a message or read she had her time
[1:52:36] away just to pray and then things kind
[1:52:38] of change you've got this going on and
[1:52:41] here they're sitting in a little rocker
[1:52:43] and you know you're trying to iron and
[1:52:45] rock them at the same time you know and
[1:52:47] you can put a rhythm you know to certain
[1:52:49] things and you you lay them down to
[1:52:51] sleep and you're like and you you know
[1:52:55] you're telling your husband fix that
[1:52:56] Creek in the floor and it gets to that
[1:53:00] place you know that to understand the
[1:53:03] season you're in the enemy can try to
[1:53:06] condemn you but remember it's not about
[1:53:10] the position of your knees or your body
[1:53:13] it's your heart you can touch God right
[1:53:18] while you're over the ironing board you
[1:53:20] can touch the throne of God even while
[1:53:22] you're over the big stockpot you can
[1:53:26] touch God so it's it's understanding
[1:53:30] those things so you didn't you come back
[1:53:31] to devil up and don't don't let him
[1:53:33] defeat you on that you can pray and you
[1:53:36] can you can you can receive from God
[1:53:38] within that you know what no doubt
[1:53:40] there's going to be times that you will
[1:53:41] also be able to to slip away into those
[1:53:44] times God understands and he knows all
[1:53:47] those things but it's important that we
[1:53:50] understand that as well because we need
[1:53:53] times of refreshing them we need them
[1:53:55] many times are refreshing only in the
[1:53:57] natural we need times of refreshing in
[1:53:59] the spiritual we need that we need that
[1:54:03] from the Lord you know as you come here
[1:54:05] to to service and I don't limit it just
[1:54:08] to service but when you come here I
[1:54:10] trust
[1:54:11] with all my heart that what God does for
[1:54:15] me in my life
[1:54:16] even in the after parts of it I trusted
[1:54:19] it encourages you I trust when you leave
[1:54:22] out of here that you're encouraged and
[1:54:24] you might have a mountain to face but
[1:54:27] you're encouraged you said I know
[1:54:29] there's a grain of sand already moved
[1:54:31] the Restless mountains going it's on its
[1:54:33] way you're encouraged in your walk in
[1:54:37] the Lord that's what I pray is that
[1:54:40] encouragement and who God has ordained
[1:54:44] and made you Lord willing we'll cover
[1:54:48] that a little bit more we'll go into
[1:54:50] this more here in the coming up time I
[1:54:54] love I tell you I told one of the
[1:54:57] brothers the other day I was up there
[1:54:58] running and ran into somebody on the
[1:54:59] path when I was running and I said man I
[1:55:02] wish I just hold a 10 day revival right
[1:55:03] now I mean of course you said well
[1:55:08] examine if I think that there were all
[1:55:09] the time the Word of God is so rich in
[1:55:12] it it's so rich but God knows he knows
[1:55:16] all these things but let us be mindful
[1:55:20] and let us pray over it take the word
[1:55:23] that God is speaking to us not just now
[1:55:24] but in every time when there's a
[1:55:27] minister that's here and we hear the
[1:55:29] word of God even when you hear you're
[1:55:30] reading in the scriptures the brem says
[1:55:32] when you read in the Word of God he said
[1:55:34] before you close it say Amen brother
[1:55:40] Simon do you really believe or something
[1:55:41] - I sure do I really do I believe
[1:55:44] there's something to it you're saying so
[1:55:46] be it Lord I believe that with all my
[1:55:48] heart you see sometimes it's things that
[1:55:51] we look at and say well that's
[1:55:52] insignificant but you know it's little
[1:55:54] things that bring forth big things
[1:55:59] very very precious things
[1:56:04] God is so mindful he's mindful of every
[1:56:07] part of where we're at in this life
[1:56:09] brothers I'm ask you don't nobody take
[1:56:11] my property we're gonna need that in
[1:56:14] services to come but that shaft that
[1:56:20] shaft of an arrow what good does it do
[1:56:23] if our shaft wasn't right now I know
[1:56:29] when I break over into the spiritual
[1:56:31] hill and you look at it brother Samuel
[1:56:33] my life God bring him forth out of my
[1:56:36] life now we move into the spiritual side
[1:56:39] of it there's a shaft of his choosing he
[1:56:45] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:56:47] world you and I we are born of his genes
[1:56:54] ordained that the purpose of life the
[1:56:57] molding of the character and that our
[1:56:59] lives might receive a transfer of power
[1:57:03] it might hit the target that God's
[1:57:06] intended in this hour he knows what he's
[1:57:09] doing
[1:57:11] he knows what he's doing and he's in
[1:57:13] control you believe that
[1:57:16] I say lord help me i I want to reflect
[1:57:21] all of this in my life I want more of
[1:57:25] him I want more
[1:57:27] moaning molding and shaping in my life
[1:57:29] and I know the molding and shaping the
[1:57:31] reality of that molding and shaping is
[1:57:33] me dying I know that's really what it is
[1:57:36] it's me dying more that he might make
[1:57:39] himself known God's got arrows in this
[1:57:45] hour I believe I'm one of them
[1:57:48] I believe I'm looking at arrows God
[1:57:53] doesn't have a quiver the size of the
[1:57:54] world's quiver
[1:57:58] oh boy he's got arrows in his quiver and
[1:58:02] arrows are in your quiver you know you
[1:58:03] don't put arrows in the quiver to just
[1:58:06] carry them around those arrows are in
[1:58:08] there but dumpin when you put them tips
[1:58:10] on there you're not just putting tips on
[1:58:11] there to go out there and look at them
[1:58:12] in the woods you put them on there
[1:58:14] you're saying this might be that Boone
[1:58:16] and Crockett buck 175 inches typical
[1:58:20] drop times every one you're tightening
[1:58:24] on there right every life every heart
[1:58:29] every child of God every arrow of God
[1:58:33] there's a purpose and it'll meet the
[1:58:36] mark in this our children of God you
[1:58:42] love him
[1:58:44] let's just bow our heads and word of
[1:58:46] Prayer Lord Jesus Lord you're the you're
[1:58:54] the great teacher you're the you're the
[1:58:56] true preacher Lord just spoke to our
[1:59:00] hearts I'm asking that you would go with
[1:59:03] us Lord I'm not dismissing right now but
[1:59:07] I'm asking that Lord in our hearts may
[1:59:11] you lord the the great teacher
[1:59:15] continue to break your word to our
[1:59:17] hearts and encourage each and every one
[1:59:21] of your children Lord father how you
[1:59:25] have you've spoke Lord with a sternness
[1:59:30] but yet you've spoken sweetness to bring
[1:59:34] forth out of our life that which is true
[1:59:39] that which is right
[1:59:40] I pray this morning Lord for each heart
[1:59:44] each life that's gathered here for every
[1:59:49] every one Lord that you've been dealing
[1:59:52] Lord with the heart I pray that God that
[1:59:56] may there be further steps that are made
[1:59:58] this morning where they were Lord God
[2:00:01] were drawn closer to may their hearts
[2:00:04] arise Lord in faith Lord to believe and
[2:00:09] to recognize why the Lord in their life
[2:00:13] maybe they've tried to fit in and do so
[2:00:16] many different things in this life but
[2:00:18] there is empty as empty as empty can be
[2:00:21] may the lord may their heart be turned
[2:00:24] to you and say lord
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:28] I'm trying to I'm tired of funding
[2:00:31] trying to find my identity would you
[2:00:34] show me Lord who I am Lord would you
[2:00:39] make known to me lord god I'm tired Lord
[2:00:43] of trying to fit in here and fit in
[2:00:45] there I just know what I want to turn my
[2:00:48] life over to you because you already
[2:00:51] knew me Lord to the very stature to the
[2:00:56] color of hair to the highest of all even
[2:00:58] the complexion you knew me Lord nor does
[2:01:03] David could say these thoughts are too
[2:01:08] wonderful for me they are too high that
[2:01:10] I cannot attain unto but we can believe
[2:01:14] them by faith
[2:01:18] what I pray for every each parent every
[2:01:23] husband every wife every father and
[2:01:27] every mother your god I think your
[2:01:31] father for each and every one one
[2:01:34] family's right here Lord in the church
[2:01:36] Lord and your God their hearts were
[2:01:40] there they're pouring their life no
[2:01:43] wonder your prophet would say all that
[2:01:46] was in God he had poured into Christ in
[2:01:49] Christ and taught in the church Lord you
[2:01:52] pour your life into us Lord we think of
[2:01:56] that on the natural Lord as parents Lord
[2:02:00] it's the pouring in it's to pour our
[2:02:02] lives a strength more not to wear that
[2:02:07] we put our children ahead of you but to
[2:02:09] wear that everything is in its line to
[2:02:12] recognize Oh God
[2:02:13] they're a heritage of the Lord Father
[2:02:18] give strength to that mother right now
[2:02:20] that's weary Lord would you reach down
[2:02:23] and just encourage her and let her know
[2:02:25] dear god what an awesome responsibility
[2:02:27] but you've equipped her with that Lord
[2:02:30] you've ordained her for that Lord God
[2:02:32] it's attributes that Lord that you
[2:02:34] placed within her life or God and father
[2:02:37] those attributes Lord God
[2:02:39] you're there to guide them Lord and
[2:02:41] direct them Lord bail or she received
[2:02:44] just that strength and encouragement
[2:02:45] Lord just even in looking up to you and
[2:02:47] saying lord help me like Noah no doubt
[2:02:50] kneeling down to pray she's asking you
[2:02:53] Lord God Father for daddy I pray that
[2:02:58] God move upon daddy's heart Lord oh god
[2:03:03] me may daddy recognize the Lord that
[2:03:06] it's not only the providing of clothing
[2:03:08] and shelter and food
[2:03:11] the Lord it's ministering even to those
[2:03:13] emotional needs of that child directing
[2:03:18] and guiding that home as a leader Lord
[2:03:21] seeking the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:24] that father it might be the Holy Ghost
[2:03:27] leading him Lord I pray that you'll give
[2:03:30] courage Lord give strength to Daddy Lord
[2:03:34] no doubt father in this age nor do you
[2:03:38] knew you already knew it
[2:03:40] it parallels the time in the book of
[2:03:43] Exodus where the children were drawing
[2:03:45] near to deliverance when Moses came with
[2:03:49] that message the people were in such
[2:03:51] bondage they were overworked they were
[2:03:56] in a bitterness of bondage but Lord
[2:04:01] Jesus you moved upon that bitterness of
[2:04:06] bondage you were Lord it brought a
[2:04:10] change of conditions
[2:04:12] I pray Heavenly Father here this
[2:04:16] afternoon
[2:04:18] Lord God many of the things Lord they
[2:04:22] they wanted to make bricks without straw
[2:04:25] lorry many times the Lord no doubt
[2:04:29] demanding hours sometimes Lord is daddy
[2:04:32] would come home maybe he comes home but
[2:04:33] there's a project that he still has to
[2:04:34] work on it's in the back of his mind I
[2:04:38] pray Lord would you strengthen daddy
[2:04:41] Lord would you help him Lord would you
[2:04:45] Lord God don't let him look down or no
[2:04:48] let him look Lord in a manner of
[2:04:49] condemnation but maybe Lord very much
[2:04:52] aware and say lord help me I want to
[2:04:54] redeem the time Lord help me Lord and
[2:04:59] within what what has had helped me Lord
[2:05:02] the influence my family to you Lord
[2:05:06] Oh God
[2:05:10] you never intended
[2:05:13] us to be left alone neither do you
[2:05:18] intend Lord our children to be left
[2:05:20] alone but that is bad
[2:05:25] [Music]

[2:05:37] each and every parent the grandparents

[2:05:42] all God bless them richly Lord not it's
[2:05:46] not something that they have to overdo

[2:05:50] for taking that time seeing that value
[2:05:52] Lord that grandchild with grandpa or
[2:05:56] grandma I recognize it's a crucial time
