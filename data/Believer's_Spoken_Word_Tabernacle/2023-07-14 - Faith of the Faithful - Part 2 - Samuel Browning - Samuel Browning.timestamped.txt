[32:54] amen I'm glad it was by his thoughts
[32:58] amen
[32:58] [Music]
[32:59] amen not on the thoughts of of anything
[33:01] else
[33:02] because we could look at a lot of
[33:04] circumstances and we could look at it
[33:07] and say it's it's beyond hope
[33:10] but you know once it's something to wear
[33:12] when you've met God you know that
[33:14] there's no circumstance
[33:16] that's beyond Redemption
[33:19] you say brother Samuel that's an awful
[33:21] that's an awful big statement well I'm
[33:24] only making a statement from an
[33:26] experience
[33:27] and there's a number of quotes I could
[33:29] give you on that or with scripture but I
[33:32] think the prophet I love the I love the
[33:34] statement
[33:35] and I gave this to a person here not too
[33:37] long ago some things they were
[33:40] struggling with and I took them to that
[33:42] place in the token brother Brahm says no
[33:44] matter how far stooped in sin you are
[33:49] the grace of God through the blood of
[33:52] Jesus Christ is sufficient
[33:55] to break it
[33:57] so you know what I say that's not the
[33:59] only quote I can take take from that one
[34:01] right there but I say no matter what
[34:03] situation the blood of Jesus Christ is
[34:07] greater
[34:11] and that's why I stand firm on the word
[34:13] that no matter what situation there's no
[34:16] there's no one unredeemable
[34:21] Satan may have wanted to try to twist a
[34:24] lot of things up but there's no one
[34:25] that's unredeemable
[34:27] brother Branham finishes that quote and
[34:29] he says if you feel that tug on your
[34:31] heart that's the Holy Spirit tugging
[34:33] upon you
[34:34] and you ought to just just just respond
[34:36] to that pulsation and say Blue Devil
[34:40] get out of here
[34:41] amen God is so good isn't he
[34:45] amen and amen thank God for his goodness
[34:48] and his grace and it's just good to be
[34:50] together this evening amen and uh I want
[34:53] to remind you if you haven't looked at
[34:55] the calendar here for this month please
[34:58] do so I know it's in the restrooms it's
[35:00] been sent up by email as well if you

[35:04] lot of events brother Jerry will be with

[35:23] brother Ronnie will come up for the
[35:24] Youth service on that evening and so uh
[35:28] we've already got that out and got it
[35:29] posted the different uh pastors and
[35:31] different ones and so uh just just
[35:34] remember that in prayer as well so a lot
[35:37] of different events and if you just um
[35:39] if you haven't received the calendar or
[35:41] you need to take a picture of it just so
[35:43] you stay abreast of that
[35:45] amen
[35:47] let's look into the word of the Lord
[35:48] thank you musicians amen enjoyed that
[35:51] song service
[35:53] amen and uh
[35:55] we want to look here in the scriptures
[35:57] for just a few moments this evening
[35:59] and uh
[36:02] I want to go back here in job 23.
[36:06] this particular chapter was just a
[36:08] chapter that has just uh
[36:11] from way back in the fall when we
[36:13] started dealing with job as one of those
[36:15] chapters I the Holy Spirit just really
[36:17] took me into and we're just coming into
[36:20] right now but uh
[36:23] just from listening in the message I've
[36:25] heard but now I see many of these
[36:27] points and these thoughts and a lot of
[36:29] these scriptures some of these
[36:30] scriptures we read right here you know
[36:32] there's some familiar scriptures out of
[36:34] the Book of Job like job 19. you know we
[36:36] I know my redeemer liveth there's
[36:38] certain scriptures that are but you know
[36:40] you find throughout every chapter not
[36:43] every chapter but every you find a
[36:45] common theme throughout it all that job
[36:48] job is standing and job standing pretty
[36:50] pretty solid that I'm not a hypocrite I
[36:53] know where I'm standing and he's got all
[36:55] this accusation that's coming all around
[36:57] him but job knows if I can just if I can
[37:01] just talk to him if I can just talk to
[37:04] him and I'm sure that we all come into
[37:07] those places in our lives I believe that
[37:09] this book if we'll take for an example I
[37:13] believe this is this is a a book and a
[37:16] witness that many Through the Ages have
[37:19] drawn upon as a matter of fact Abraham
[37:22] Drew upon this experience because
[37:25] Abraham remember he was moved by the
[37:27] same revelation Nation to be buried
[37:29] where job was buried because because the
[37:32] resurrection was not promised in Egypt
[37:34] the resurrection was promised in
[37:37] Palestine
[37:38] amen so let's just look here in verse 8.
[37:43] behold I go forward
[37:45] but he is not there and backward
[37:49] but I cannot perceive him
[37:51] on the left hand where he doth work but
[37:55] I cannot Behold Him
[37:57] he hideth himself on the right hand
[38:01] that I cannot see him you know you take
[38:03] one thing from this
[38:05] job is speaking of him he's a person
[38:09] job knows him as a person he spoke to me
[38:13] I've heard his voice I've talked with
[38:15] him job knows he's here
[38:18] he's around here he's here
[38:20] so job's aware that God is the Living
[38:23] God and what God has done for him
[38:26] but he knoweth the way that I take when
[38:30] the earth tried me I shall come forth as
[38:33] gold my foot hath held his steps his way
[38:39] have I kept and not declined
[38:42] neither have I gone back from the
[38:45] Commandment of his lips I have esteemed
[38:48] the words of his mouth more than my
[38:52] necessary food
[38:54] amen let's just go to the Lord in a word
[38:56] of prayer tonight
[38:58] perhaps you want to be remembered in
[39:00] prayer your need on your heart just make
[39:01] it known to the Lord
[39:03] let's just invite him just to come
[39:06] Heavenly Father
[39:09] Lord Jesus how we thank you o God lord
[39:14] for the not only the promises that
[39:16] you've made but God to know that God
[39:19] you're present to keep every word and
[39:22] Lord you said were two or three are
[39:24] gathered together in my name I'll be in
[39:26] their midst Lord Jesus may you just come
[39:30] Lord I pray among us to every heart to
[39:34] every need Lord father of things Lord
[39:37] that you've Lord inspired to my heart
[39:40] but I'm depending on you Lord that God
[39:43] that you will give it Lord just as you
[39:45] see fit Lord as it's needed Lord God we
[39:49] just Reserve ourselves Lord as speaker
[39:51] and hear Lord oh God to your presence to
[39:55] your word Lord may you just come Among
[39:57] Us in a special way Lord and perform
[40:00] your word I pray o God minister to every
[40:03] need behind every uplifted hand or God
[40:06] for you're the satisfier Lord we just
[40:10] Lord welcome you Lord and we give
[40:12] ourselves to you in the name of Jesus
[40:14] Christ amen amen God bless you as you're
[40:17] being seated
[40:21] the scriptures I want to really to to
[40:25] draw from even as we look at it
[40:28] I I look at that in verse 11 and verse
[40:31] 12 and just to ponder him to look over
[40:34] those things and how that job could say
[40:37] my foot hath held his steps he's he's
[40:40] very much aware of God God's walking
[40:43] god's Direction and job is looking and
[40:47] when he says his way have I kept and not
[40:49] declined neither have I gone back from
[40:53] the Commandment of his lips I have
[40:55] esteemed the words of his mouth more
[40:58] than my necessary food you know it's
[41:01] it's something that we can we can take
[41:04] the word of God and I this this is God's
[41:07] mind this is God in printed form
[41:10] and it takes God to come on the scene
[41:12] and to inspire and to make that word
[41:15] live out and when God comes the word
[41:18] will live just exactly according to how
[41:22] God thought when he accepted and when it
[41:26] when it comes to past it'll never
[41:28] contradict any other previous word so
[41:32] when we even would speak of a greater
[41:34] Revelation a greater Revelation never
[41:38] nullifies or under or UN undoes in any
[41:42] way a previous Revelation it's just more
[41:45] of God coming on display in our life
[41:48] it's the same thing with justification
[41:50] justification is a work of the Holy
[41:53] Spirit sanctification is more of the
[41:56] same Holy Spirit and the baptism of the
[41:59] Holy Ghost is more of the same holy
[42:01] ghost coming in to take his Dwelling
[42:04] Place in our life and so it's just more
[42:07] of God unfolding himself and when we we
[42:09] look at this here that job had an
[42:12] acquaintance with the very character of
[42:14] God you know it's one thing to know
[42:16] God's word and to know the letter but to
[42:19] be in contact and United with God's
[42:22] character with God's life with God's
[42:24] nature it it is something that is so
[42:28] precious because through that it it
[42:30] brings us to a place to where now what
[42:34] is invisible to others now becomes
[42:37] visible through our lives it becomes
[42:39] God's grace to us to die to ourselves
[42:42] because we all go through tests and
[42:45] trials and frankly if we're not in a
[42:47] test we have come out of one or we're
[42:49] heading into one it's always it's a
[42:52] constant process because that's the
[42:54] whole purpose as we spoke on Sunday of
[42:56] that bypass the whole reason that we are
[43:00] here in this moment that God God makes
[43:03] us and gives us an opportunity to to
[43:06] serve him and that our lives would come
[43:08] in contact with him then there is a
[43:11] testing and a Proving Grounds in this
[43:14] life that's what every trial is that's
[43:16] what every temptation is so when
[43:19] Temptation comes your way don't look at
[43:22] temptation as a Bad Thing temptation is
[43:24] coming your way because it's there to
[43:27] only to manifest the goods that are
[43:30] there in your life
[43:32] are you hearing me so when we say this
[43:35] that this character that is here that
[43:38] job is in contact with God's character
[43:40] because not only do we want to just be
[43:43] able to look at the written word but
[43:45] when things are coming our way we want
[43:48] to act in the character and the manner
[43:50] that God would act out and that's where
[43:54] job is saying that job is saying that
[43:56] not only I've not declined from his
[43:59] nature his character that's been
[44:01] revealed because let me just say this
[44:03] there's sometimes you don't have a word
[44:05] for the present situation and what's
[44:08] taking place but there's one thing that
[44:11] we always do have before us if we have
[44:13] met him and we're looking at him and
[44:16] that's his character if we ever want to
[44:19] know of one thing when we're saying Lord
[44:21] I need direction for this in my life one
[44:24] thing we can always look at is is the
[44:26] character of Jesus Christ how would God
[44:29] display and react and move in this
[44:32] situation that's why brother Brandon
[44:35] could say Lord let it be in the typos to
[44:37] my mind that when something would take
[44:39] place don't let me get angry Lord but
[44:42] let me think what would Jesus do in this
[44:46] situation how would he act and respond
[44:50] in this situation
[44:52] I pray God help us
[44:55] because not only within that character
[44:57] notice that as we will always be in line
[45:00] with the character of God then we're
[45:03] always going to be in line with God's
[45:05] word and so as as job lays that out
[45:08] there in verse 11 and verse 12 that I
[45:11] have not gone back from the Commandment
[45:13] of his lips in other words if we could
[45:15] sum it up in this way in verse 11 and
[45:17] verse 12 that in the midst of this
[45:20] moment in the midst of this time there's
[45:23] no doubt job had trials before this took
[45:26] place but one thing in the midst of this
[45:29] job could testify and say I've Not
[45:32] receded I've not gone back but I am
[45:36] standing faithful by the grace of God
[45:41] because it's a not Satan's tendency is
[45:45] to challenge and see will we back up it
[45:48] all
[45:50] when push comes to shove whether it's on
[45:52] the job whether it's among the family
[45:54] whether it's among the church no matter
[45:56] where it's at when push comes to shout
[45:58] are we going to back up or are we going
[46:01] to stand on what God has revealed to you
[46:05] and I and when it's become a part of you
[46:07] and I there's a resiliency within our
[46:10] lives it should be that our desire is to
[46:13] please God more than man our desire
[46:16] we're called here to serve God not man
[46:18] serve God
[46:23] now notice this example here in James
[46:25] chapter 5 how that James would pick this
[46:28] up in verse 10 take my brethren the
[46:31] prophets who have spoken in the name of
[46:34] the Lord for an example of suffering and
[46:37] affliction and of patience behold we
[46:41] count them happy which endure you have
[46:44] heard of the patience of Job and have
[46:48] seen the end of the Lord that the Lord
[46:50] is very pitiful and of a tender Mercy
[46:55] so the patience of Job and brother
[46:57] Brandon would pick this up in this
[46:59] manner and I have heard but now I see he
[47:01] says we find out in his life and trials
[47:04] and his great faith even Jesus when he
[47:07] came on Earth he referred to the
[47:09] patience of Job he said have you not
[47:12] read of the patience of Job see faith
[47:15] and that's why we're dwelling on faith
[47:17] Waits with patience for the promised
[47:21] word to be fulfilled
[47:23] so while we're waiting on the
[47:25] Fulfillment of the word
[47:27] no matter what it is Faith Waits
[47:32] but if what is called Faith quickly
[47:36] strictly there's a renouncing and a
[47:38] turning side then it was not faith
[47:42] Faith Waits now this Faith that's being
[47:45] spoke of here that faith that job had
[47:48] when every situation his entire
[47:51] environment and everything about him his
[47:54] body his family his close friends
[47:56] everyone there was no one around him
[48:00] that was for him there was no one to
[48:03] encourage him job's wife didn't
[48:05] encourage him in this
[48:07] are you hearing me she didn't even
[48:10] encourage him job was able to stand
[48:12] there and discern it you thou speak us
[48:14] like a foolish woman she wasn't the
[48:16] foolish woman but he's able to discern
[48:19] what's coming from her to his life there
[48:22] is a faith that is standing in the midst
[48:25] of this time and that's what I want to
[48:27] just dwell on for a little bit longer
[48:29] here is Faith of the faithful because
[48:32] Faith itself is the great element that
[48:35] God has given to you and I given to that
[48:38] of of mankind and everyone every person
[48:42] walking has Faith but what's needed is
[48:46] God's faith to come upon us and anoint
[48:49] our faith so that our faith reflects the
[48:52] will of God because if it's just our
[48:55] faith our faith alone can waver in
[48:58] everything else but God's faith moving
[49:02] down upon our life so simply put God's
[49:05] faith is his spirit is his life
[49:10] is his word
[49:12] are you with me that's why they listen
[49:14] now even in this I just want to just
[49:17] laying this in because that in itself
[49:19] when when a person has come face to face
[49:22] with God and that resigns within their
[49:25] heart that I've met God there's a faith
[49:28] on the inside something that's greater
[49:30] than what you can explain something that
[49:33] has lifted you from death unto life
[49:35] something that has changed your life
[49:38] that is God's faith operating in your
[49:41] life
[49:42] and through that we look to him when
[49:46] there's needs that happen maybe sickness
[49:48] in our body
[49:50] and Satan likes to come around when
[49:52] there's a need in the body I I've spoke
[49:55] many times with others and even in my
[49:58] own life sometimes you wonder because we
[50:00] have a if I want to say it like this a
[50:02] Litany of quotes we have uh uh
[50:05] scriptures we can go on but it's always
[50:08] careful to make sure that it's God
[50:11] handling those quotes
[50:13] are you with me don't allow the enemy
[50:15] you say well how I know it's the enemy
[50:16] because the enemy will take the words of
[50:18] God and run you in the ground with it
[50:20] and make you seem like nothing but a
[50:23] cheap nothing but the spirit of God will
[50:26] never do that
[50:27] the spirit of God is a uplifting Spirit
[50:31] even when he deals with sin in our life
[50:34] he's not dealing to put us down he's
[50:37] dealing to lift us up and set us free
[50:40] and so when we look at this in the
[50:42] scripture there are times that when we
[50:45] come in the need for even whether it's
[50:47] healing whether it's a job no matter the
[50:49] situation and we are waiting for Faith
[50:54] which is a revelation from God to drop
[50:56] concerning that situation is that right
[50:59] but in the meantime when we're waiting
[51:02] on that when we're looking and saying
[51:04] God I don't know what you know what
[51:06] what's going to come out with this here
[51:07] but Faith within my heart says that you
[51:11] are and you are healer you're the Lord
[51:13] that healeth all my diseases by your
[51:16] stripes I'm Healed and we're perfectly
[51:18] in line with the word of God what are we
[51:20] doing we're standing in a place
[51:22] available for that Faith to drop down
[51:26] because faith is a revelation
[51:29] that's why we walk by faith it's
[51:34] Revelation unto Revelation unto
[51:37] revelation
[51:38] so in many different situations and I I
[51:41] say that just as a little side note
[51:43] because sometimes we what has been
[51:45] called faith is actually hope
[51:48] well you just need to step out by faith
[51:51] well Peter just didn't step out by faith
[51:52] he was bidden to come
[51:55] hear him hear me now you just need to
[51:58] take off to this other state by faith ah
[52:01] faith is a revelation it's something
[52:04] that drops in your heart another place
[52:07] brother Rams says it is the revelation
[52:09] of the will of God
[52:12] that's what faith is and we need his
[52:15] leadership for each moment and each time
[52:19] in our life that's why for a believer's
[52:21] life if there's anything that even you
[52:24] are are planning to Embark upon that is
[52:28] not solid in your heart that you've got
[52:31] a word from God don't do it
[52:36] don't do it because if you go ahead and
[52:39] do it then there's going to be regrets
[52:41] later on why did I do this don't go by
[52:43] motion go by a settled walk with God
[52:47] that God's dropped in your heart and if
[52:50] God don't drop it in your heart if
[52:51] there's nothing in coming what do I do
[52:53] wait on the Lord and say God is there
[52:56] something I'm looking at maybe it's not
[52:58] right maybe it's me Lord that's not
[53:01] right but whatever it is I know that
[53:03] you're a God who reveals yourself and
[53:06] makes known your will your desire is
[53:08] your will for my life
[53:11] then you're in a place for Faith to drop
[53:15] faith is standing there but then you're
[53:17] in a place for God to reveal his will
[53:20] for the next step
[53:23] I think we all have done things we've
[53:26] been on you you're uncertainty and
[53:28] uncertain about certain things you do
[53:30] well I I hope this is it I hope that we
[53:33] don't want to do that and we learn
[53:36] we learn
[53:38] we learn with them yes we are Sons and
[53:41] Daughters of God but it's not us
[53:43] wielding wielding God's will to our will
[53:47] the victory is Lord let thine will be
[53:51] done
[53:52] not my will
[53:54] now Faith Waits with patience for the
[53:58] promised word to be fulfilled
[54:00] think about think about Joseph and we
[54:03] mentioned this on Sunday how Joseph
[54:05] waited for the word to be fulfilled he
[54:08] had a word
[54:10] but here he is in bondage
[54:12] and the Bible would say it like this
[54:13] until the time that his word came the
[54:16] word of the Lord Tried Him
[54:18] what's Joe Joseph what are you going to
[54:21] do
[54:22] what is what's going to take place
[54:25] his everything that's happening doesn't
[54:28] make sense
[54:31] there's nothing about Joseph when he's
[54:34] going through it I'm not talking about
[54:35] us reading about it we can look at it
[54:37] all the perfect type of Christ and all
[54:39] that's us seeing us seeing it but while
[54:42] he was going through it he didn't see
[54:44] that kind of sounds familiar doesn't it
[54:47] a lot of times we don't see things that
[54:50] we're going through we don't see any
[54:52] benefit we don't see why is this and
[54:54] what how is this going to work out we're
[54:56] not seeing that Joseph was the same way
[55:00] every believer has been the same way
[55:04] job has been the same way so what are
[55:06] you saying welcome to the club
[55:10] but what does that bring me to trusting
[55:13] in Him and trust is Faith Lord I don't
[55:15] understand this Faith doesn't require me
[55:18] to understand it faith is I just know
[55:20] that God's in control
[55:23] that's what I know I know where I'm
[55:25] standing in here God's in control
[55:29] and until the next order comes I'm going
[55:31] to stay right here
[55:33] I'm gonna stay right here with what he's
[55:34] revealed I'm going to stay right here
[55:40] now notice in first Thessalonians
[55:42] chapter one let's look at a few examples
[55:45] among some believers
[55:47] and Paul
[55:49] a very familiar scripture we read from
[55:51] in first Thessalonians 5 and I don't
[55:54] have this included but it's one we're
[55:56] familiar with for the gospel came not
[55:58] unto you in word only but also in power
[56:01] and in the Holy Ghost and in much
[56:03] Assurance as you know what manner of men
[56:06] we were among you for your sake
[56:09] I I I could I could preach on this a
[56:11] while but do you realize God has not
[56:15] left us to our own devices
[56:18] God has not left you and I in a place to
[56:21] say create your own atmosphere for faith
[56:25] but God is responsible
[56:27] to create that atmosphere
[56:30] you'll see what brother Samuel am I not
[56:32] as a Believer to create an atmosphere
[56:34] how do I create the atmosphere you step
[56:37] into the atmosphere that he's creating
[56:40] see the Holy Ghost came the Holy Ghost
[56:43] came and brought much Assurance notice
[56:45] there was a gathering by the word the
[56:48] people had to come into a place by the
[56:50] word already into a place of being in
[56:53] one Accord just like it was in Acts
[56:55] chapter 2 the what what brings the
[56:57] people into a place of unity the word
[57:00] what brought the fire down on Mount
[57:03] Carmel Elijah said I've done this at Thy
[57:07] word he gathered the Loose Ends and tied
[57:10] them in to the altar that brought the
[57:13] fire of God
[57:15] it's the word that gives order it's the
[57:17] word that gives Direction in our life
[57:20] simple Direction leads to the blessing
[57:23] of God
[57:24] and so notice God's desire this is the
[57:27] whole purpose of God's presence coming
[57:29] in the Fulfillment of his word is to
[57:32] bring within our hearts a much assurance
[57:36] an assurance that even for whatever need
[57:39] that you have you've got Assurance to
[57:41] step out of the boat you've got
[57:43] Assurance to step in the troubled water
[57:45] you've got Assurance to take God at his
[57:48] word who is that that's doing it it's
[57:51] God fulfilling his word
[57:54] who wants it that caused the woman with
[57:56] the issue of blood when she said if I
[57:58] can but Touch the Hem of His Garment it
[58:01] was God in Christ it had made an
[58:04] impression upon her heart something was
[58:07] scary she had heard in the Fulfillment
[58:09] of the word now she's in the presence of
[58:12] the word being fulfilled there's an
[58:14] atmosphere of faith that is there to
[58:18] ignite and charge that faith that she
[58:20] has
[58:21] that it can be released
[58:23] and it was a different touch
[58:26] it was a different touch I just if we
[58:28] can just take that just for a moment we
[58:30] could preach a month or Sunday's on
[58:32] there what are you saying by the same
[58:33] I'm just saying just be ready when you
[58:35] even you come here be ready just to step
[58:38] in
[58:39] be ready said God help me to be a
[58:41] channel help me to shut all the things
[58:42] of the world out and not just here not
[58:44] just here but in every part of the Lord
[58:46] help me just to shut it down and help me
[58:47] just to become a channel that's ready
[58:49] just to step in because of much
[58:51] Assurance Lord
[58:55] and you became followers of us I want to
[58:58] read this verse 6 and you became
[58:59] followers of us and of the Lord having
[59:02] received the word in much Affliction
[59:05] with joy of the Holy Ghost that so that
[59:08] you were in samples
[59:10] to all that believe in Macedonia and
[59:13] acacia
[59:15] for from you I love this scripture
[59:17] sounded out the word of the Lord not
[59:19] only in Macedonia and Acacia now notice
[59:24] the word of the Lord came to them
[59:27] through God's servant
[59:29] but they received that word
[59:32] Paul would write of it in another place
[59:34] for this Thessalonian Church they
[59:37] received the word not as the word of men
[59:40] but as the word of God but effectually
[59:43] worketh in your life
[59:46] and they've received this word now
[59:48] through their lives because see the word
[59:50] is not a dead letter the word is a
[59:53] living reality it lives it's called
[59:56] living himself out it's not me
[59:58] struggling well I gotta put an apple I
[1:00:01] gotta put a leaf out I gotta put a
[1:00:02] branch out it's not me struggling
[1:00:06] it's God living out his life
[1:00:12] that's what the whole rest of the Holy
[1:00:14] Ghost is about not me it's not I that
[1:00:18] liveth not my power not by might but by
[1:00:20] my spirit saith the Lord Brother say no
[1:00:23] what that is saying is I know God let me
[1:00:26] get out of the way help me to get out of
[1:00:29] the way and you just be a channel
[1:00:32] that's what God wants sometimes our
[1:00:34] things that we can think so spiritual is
[1:00:37] actually us getting in the way and God
[1:00:40] is saying I'm not going to come down and
[1:00:42] put my hand to it lest thou should get
[1:00:44] the glory but it's surrendering yourself
[1:00:47] to me how do I Surrender obey the word
[1:00:51] obey the word
[1:00:53] obey the word what God is speaking to
[1:00:55] your heart what God is dealing with just
[1:00:57] obey the word and watch God come on the
[1:00:59] scene
[1:01:01] but also in every place notice in every
[1:01:03] place your faith
[1:01:06] to God word is spread abroad so that we
[1:01:10] need not to speak anything notice your
[1:01:13] faith so it's God's faith that has moved
[1:01:16] down behind their faith
[1:01:19] right that's so what the world says and
[1:01:23] can look and say man what a faithful
[1:01:26] bunch of people
[1:01:27] but it's not a faithful people on our
[1:01:30] own faith it's God's faith moving behind
[1:01:34] us that's the secret the faith of the
[1:01:37] faithful
[1:01:39] right
[1:01:40] that's where the whole secret and so I
[1:01:42] want you to notice watch how we read in
[1:01:44] verse 9 I want you to see the effect
[1:01:46] here of that influence of the word
[1:01:48] living out for they themselves show us
[1:01:51] what manner of entering in we had unto
[1:01:53] you and how ye turn to God from Idols to
[1:01:58] serve the living and true God notice the
[1:02:01] effect of the word the effect of the
[1:02:02] word is turning their lives this was the
[1:02:06] thessalonikians it turned their lives
[1:02:08] from Idols to the Living God
[1:02:11] and that same faith that they had now
[1:02:14] operating in their life it's having an
[1:02:17] effect on others
[1:02:20] you see God's faith and your
[1:02:22] faithfulness listen friends your
[1:02:25] faithfulness my faithfulness it's not
[1:02:27] for you it's not for me this is this and
[1:02:31] the whole the whole synopsis if we can
[1:02:33] say it like this of a Christian Life is
[1:02:36] a sacrificial life it's living for
[1:02:39] others
[1:02:40] not that our life becomes a stopper on
[1:02:43] the end but it only becomes a place that
[1:02:45] another channel is plugged into we are a
[1:02:49] body
[1:02:51] one entity is not the body the arm is
[1:02:54] not the body the eye is not the body but
[1:02:56] the body is the body all together and we
[1:03:01] need one another
[1:03:05] and this and the effect this is the
[1:03:07] effect they're showing us what manner of
[1:03:11] entering in we had to do so the
[1:03:13] testimony Paul say what we're seeing in
[1:03:15] other places is the testimony of God's
[1:03:19] working that has moved in your life and
[1:03:22] now work through your life to affect
[1:03:24] others
[1:03:26] oh God
[1:03:28] help us Lord Jesus
[1:03:31] and to wait for his son from Heaven whom
[1:03:35] he raised from the dead even Jesus which
[1:03:38] delivered us from the Wrath to come
[1:03:41] Faith Waits
[1:03:43] with patience
[1:03:47] for the prophesied
[1:03:49] promise
[1:03:50] and to realize there's no other way for
[1:03:52] us to actually get
[1:03:54] patience without faithfulness
[1:03:58] patience is the outcome
[1:04:00] of faithfulness
[1:04:02] we all want more patience right
[1:04:04] right now
[1:04:06] right now want more patience
[1:04:09] right
[1:04:11] I don't think I hadn't touched one in
[1:04:12] the room now with that statement
[1:04:14] but but patience is the outcome of
[1:04:16] faithfulness
[1:04:18] through times like this through times of
[1:04:21] testing and trying through times when
[1:04:24] we're not getting any answer
[1:04:26] seems like we're not making any Headway
[1:04:28] so so to say what we feel or we think
[1:04:32] we might feel like our prayers are
[1:04:34] hitting the ceiling and coming right
[1:04:35] back down on us
[1:04:38] but this is a time that standing
[1:04:40] faithful by his faith Lord
[1:04:43] I know I have met you
[1:04:46] I know where I'm standing with you I my
[1:04:49] feelings all around me right now there
[1:04:51] are feelings that are contrary to the
[1:04:54] reality inside of me
[1:04:58] Paul said Galatians 5 5 for we through
[1:05:01] the spirit wait for the hope
[1:05:03] of righteousness
[1:05:05] by faith how are we through the spirit
[1:05:08] waiting for the hope of righteousness by
[1:05:11] faith so what has Faith done what does
[1:05:13] faith do because you'll find many times
[1:05:15] as brother random will tell us hope is
[1:05:17] the biggest enemy that faith has but
[1:05:20] it's when hope is instead of faith
[1:05:23] but you know the Bible says Hebrews 11 1
[1:05:26] faith is the substance of things
[1:05:29] hopeful so the word hope and the
[1:05:32] scripture is an expectation so what
[1:05:34] faith actually does is it puts in your
[1:05:37] hand a real expectation
[1:05:40] so it's something that it's not I don't
[1:05:42] know I don't know if God's going to do
[1:05:44] this I don't know if God know but Faith
[1:05:45] actually puts it in your hand and where
[1:05:48] you're able to stand there and say nope
[1:05:49] I know what God Said
[1:05:51] you might have a thousand reports that
[1:05:53] will come contrary no but I know what
[1:05:55] God Said see Caleb and Joshua they had
[1:05:58] all kinds of reports ten to two
[1:06:01] right God always works in the minority
[1:06:04] and God works in that way where all he
[1:06:07] needs is Faith in one heart it doesn't
[1:06:10] matter of all the opposition it doesn't
[1:06:13] matter of all those things listen to me
[1:06:15] Caleb and Joshua I know we've heard him
[1:06:17] preached on a lot but Caleb and Joshua
[1:06:19] were not super people in their own DNA
[1:06:21] they weren't people just like you and I
[1:06:24] the prophets that James wrote of were
[1:06:27] people just like you and I as a matter
[1:06:29] of fact he said they were subject to
[1:06:32] like passions in other words ups and
[1:06:35] downs just like we have so they weren't
[1:06:38] in themselves super human people but
[1:06:41] there was a super God that was greater
[1:06:45] than the feebleness of their Humanity
[1:06:48] when their Humanity would get down Lord
[1:06:51] I'm the only one there's nobody else
[1:06:53] that loves you there's nobody else to
[1:06:55] live for you and God would encourage his
[1:06:58] servant and say wait a minute you're
[1:07:00] just looking at all that you can see and
[1:07:03] all that you can feel but I have
[1:07:05] reserved
[1:07:07] unto me seven thousand
[1:07:11] glory be to God I'm glad those examples
[1:07:14] are included in there aren't you
[1:07:17] so it takes God you see our faith in our
[1:07:20] life brother Brandon would take this in
[1:07:22] faith is the victory if you get a chance
[1:07:24] to listen to that message brother
[1:07:25] Randall go into that of how that all the
[1:07:27] way through that message he deals with
[1:07:29] and even coming to the end of it of how
[1:07:31] that our faith he says when your faith
[1:07:34] he said maybe you've been up and down
[1:07:35] and in and out and everything else he
[1:07:37] said what you need is for God to come
[1:07:39] down and operate on your faith so God
[1:07:43] doesn't take our faith away but the holy
[1:07:45] ghost coming in our life is an operation
[1:07:48] of the spirit of God God's faith coming
[1:07:51] down to operate on our faith what is it
[1:07:54] doing taking away from within all of the
[1:07:57] unbelief
[1:08:00] then then notice a scripture faith is
[1:08:04] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:08:07] world even
[1:08:08] our
[1:08:10] faith
[1:08:12] but I thought it's going to be God's
[1:08:14] faith it is God's faith but it's God's
[1:08:16] faith that has operated on our faith
[1:08:20] he is operated on our face so it is
[1:08:23] faith that overcometh the world that's
[1:08:26] why when a person say well I don't have
[1:08:28] no faith no you have faith faith is a
[1:08:31] common thing God laid it out so clearly
[1:08:33] to apply the blood apply the blood with
[1:08:37] hyssa and his son is a common weed
[1:08:42] oh a person had to do was take what was
[1:08:45] being said and applied they didn't have
[1:08:47] to understand it they just had to take
[1:08:50] it there was a belief there was a
[1:08:52] saddleness this is what God has said and
[1:08:55] God has spoken God is with this man God
[1:08:58] has Vindicated this word God has
[1:09:00] Vindicated this message and take that
[1:09:03] word and apply it
[1:09:07] I don't think anybody got in your car
[1:09:10] and wonder tonight is it going to start
[1:09:16] why
[1:09:18] because that's faith
[1:09:20] faith is an unconscious thing
[1:09:22] you're not sitting here worried tonight
[1:09:26] am I going to find my way back home
[1:09:29] why faith
[1:09:31] is an unconscious thing
[1:09:34] that's natural
[1:09:36] but you understand what you and I were
[1:09:39] built for and made for as Sons and
[1:09:41] Daughters of God that when God comes in
[1:09:43] and operates on that Faith then the
[1:09:46] faith of God now it becomes unconscious
[1:09:50] to us as a people of God to stand on
[1:09:53] God's word
[1:09:56] it becomes it doesn't become a well it's
[1:09:59] called prayer meeting and see if we
[1:10:00] should keep this word or not
[1:10:03] we've met God
[1:10:05] and it's an unconscious Faith it's just
[1:10:07] it's the place that as I said whether I
[1:10:10] have received a direct word from God or
[1:10:13] not faith says that he gave a promise in
[1:10:16] his word that by his stripes I'm Healed
[1:10:21] so I can stand on that word what is it
[1:10:23] it becomes a faith that's unconscious
[1:10:27] listen to me now this is where the enemy
[1:10:31] wants to bring us to a Consciousness I'm
[1:10:33] not going to ask you this question
[1:10:34] because I want nobody get in trouble
[1:10:36] but everyone is probably drove down the
[1:10:38] road to your house
[1:10:41] and you got off on an exit and you
[1:10:43] wondered
[1:10:44] how did I just get here
[1:10:46] don't say nothing because I don't want
[1:10:48] your wife taking the keys away
[1:10:51] and you wonder
[1:10:52] how'd you get here
[1:10:59] it's unconscious
[1:11:01] it's kind of scary after it happens
[1:11:07] kind of scary
[1:11:09] even one time when I was had to stop
[1:11:12] when I was teaching school I had to stop
[1:11:14] in your plans
[1:11:15] for my class
[1:11:16] well it was kind of it was normal when I
[1:11:18] got off the exit 250 in Sandusky when I
[1:11:21] get back when I'm getting back on I go
[1:11:23] east onto
[1:11:25] two
[1:11:26] I'm supposed to be going west
[1:11:29] would you see something broke the
[1:11:31] continuity
[1:11:33] and I went back East oh Lord I got to
[1:11:35] get off in here and turn around hope I
[1:11:37] make it in time to work
[1:11:40] why just unconscious
[1:11:43] now what I'm saying is is that's how we
[1:11:46] were made to operate as Sons and
[1:11:48] Daughters of God in other words to where
[1:11:51] we're not having to stop and think
[1:11:55] and you say brother Sammy what are you
[1:11:57] talking about Satan's desire is to bring
[1:12:00] our walk into a conscious Realm
[1:12:06] and he likes to put traps in our life
[1:12:08] there's mistakes that are made there's
[1:12:11] sin but listen to me there is Grace if
[1:12:16] we confess our sin he is faithful and
[1:12:21] just to bring us back into an
[1:12:23] unconscious walk foreign
[1:12:27] because when you're conscious it's
[1:12:31] you walk up and down your stairs from
[1:12:32] your basement or up to your second floor
[1:12:34] you don't think about the distance
[1:12:35] between these stairs
[1:12:38] right you start thinking about them
[1:12:39] you'll trip
[1:12:41] right you start thinking about promises
[1:12:44] in God's word I'm talking about thinking
[1:12:46] of them where you break into a conscious
[1:12:48] realm and you're looking at whether
[1:12:50] you're worthy or not you you're never
[1:12:52] going to be worthy in your own accord
[1:12:54] our worthiness is by the blood of the
[1:12:57] Lamb okay how many how many days in a
[1:13:00] row that
[1:13:01] you'd say I've had
[1:13:03] I've had a good day it is because of the
[1:13:06] grace of God
[1:13:08] it's not an excuse to live anyway but
[1:13:11] it's to remember it's God's grace in our
[1:13:14] life and God's desire is for us to
[1:13:17] remember no man shall be able to stand
[1:13:20] before thee all the days of thy life
[1:13:22] Joshua I want you to walk unconscious of
[1:13:25] fear
[1:13:27] I want you to walk unconscious
[1:13:30] what how do I do that just keep all the
[1:13:32] channels cleared out between me and you
[1:13:35] as the Son of God that's your
[1:13:37] responsibility
[1:13:39] I say God help me
[1:13:41] say God help me
[1:13:43] yeah God help me
[1:13:45] thank God we have something greater than
[1:13:47] Liquid Plumber we got the Holy Ghost
[1:13:51] so having on the breath and notice in
[1:13:54] Ephesians 6 I don't have time to read
[1:13:56] this but out of Ephesians 6 remember it
[1:13:59] says let me just read a couple verses
[1:14:01] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:14:03] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:14:07] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:14:11] stand
[1:14:12] well what all have you and I done to
[1:14:14] stand we've taken his way
[1:14:16] job said he knows the way I take because
[1:14:19] it's his way
[1:14:20] he's revealed the provided way so having
[1:14:22] done all this that what have I done we
[1:14:25] have yielded to his voice
[1:14:28] walked in obedience to his word yielded
[1:14:31] to his spirit and knowing that that's
[1:14:33] what's needed in order to be able to
[1:14:36] stand in this day
[1:14:39] not be conformed to the world back and
[1:14:41] forth but you see all of these things
[1:14:44] all of these parts of this armor because
[1:14:46] the word of God wrapped up in our life
[1:14:48] it's all these parts our life everything
[1:14:52] is meant to walk in a unit of Harmony
[1:14:56] I said I wasn't going to read it but I
[1:14:58] just feel to do that as we're looking at
[1:15:00] this stand there for having your loins
[1:15:02] gird about with truth
[1:15:04] you know what your loins are where they
[1:15:06] would wear the long garments and as the
[1:15:08] garments were long
[1:15:10] when they had to move like when they're
[1:15:12] coming out of Egypt when the father ran
[1:15:15] to the prodigal son he had to take his
[1:15:17] garments and tuck them in
[1:15:21] why so that his way was unimpeded
[1:15:25] in other words not hindered
[1:15:27] and that's where the word of God having
[1:15:29] your loins Gert about with truth
[1:15:32] having his word about your life
[1:15:38] and having on the breastplate of
[1:15:40] righteousness that's simply doing what's
[1:15:41] right
[1:15:43] simply doing what's right and your feet
[1:15:46] shod with the preparation of the Gospel
[1:15:49] of thief faith of peace and above all
[1:15:52] taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye
[1:15:56] shall be able to quench all the fiery
[1:15:59] darts of the wicked notice the shield of
[1:16:02] Faith but you'll be able to fuse that
[1:16:05] Shield of Faith to quench all the fiery
[1:16:08] darts
[1:16:09] what is it it's not that darts won't be
[1:16:12] shot they're going to be fired they're
[1:16:13] going to be fired and remember why they
[1:16:16] are fiery darts it is meant to ignite a
[1:16:20] flammable source
[1:16:23] so cover your buttons
[1:16:27] cover your buttons because the the docks
[1:16:30] will fly to push your buttons
[1:16:33] darts will fly but how do I quench them
[1:16:36] the shield of faith
[1:16:38] The Shield of Faith all of this working
[1:16:40] together in a unit and a Harmony of the
[1:16:44] Holy Spirit
[1:16:45] and take the helmet of salvation or mine
[1:16:48] our mind is filled with the word of God
[1:16:50] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:16:53] word of God praying always with all
[1:16:56] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[1:16:59] now I want you to think about it like
[1:17:01] this
[1:17:02] um this picture I tried to look up and
[1:17:05] I've seen there's a lot of different
[1:17:07] uh
[1:17:09] pictures that come and I I don't want to
[1:17:11] show the wrong one but brother Brown
[1:17:13] talks about this picture it's called the
[1:17:16] Cloudland one from Germany
[1:17:18] remember he talks about how that when
[1:17:21] you walked into this um the museum there
[1:17:24] the art museum that when you're looking
[1:17:26] at that picture from a distance man it
[1:17:29] looks like a storm that's coming that's
[1:17:31] going to turn tear the place wide open
[1:17:34] and brother Brian said but the guide
[1:17:37] came along and told us move up closer
[1:17:42] now who who would want to get closer
[1:17:47] to clouds that look like that
[1:17:51] imagine taking your mind some of the
[1:17:54] worst clouds you've seen
[1:17:57] come on we've seen them even over the
[1:17:58] past few days
[1:17:59] still clouds that you can look at and
[1:18:01] you know by looking at them clouds it's
[1:18:04] not a question of should I go fishing
[1:18:06] today or not
[1:18:07] you look at those clouds and know it's
[1:18:09] time to get indoors
[1:18:12] right it's a time when you look at those
[1:18:13] clouds and say change plans no barbecue
[1:18:16] tonight
[1:18:17] right the clouds they're there they give
[1:18:21] they give them the signal and brother
[1:18:23] Brown's talking about looking at these
[1:18:24] clouds and he says and the guide itself
[1:18:26] he said actually encouraged us go and
[1:18:30] look a little closer
[1:18:32] and so one was looking as just a
[1:18:35] horrible thing and Gloom but as the
[1:18:38] people move closer they realized
[1:18:42] it's angel's wings beating together
[1:18:46] and and you think about it the natural
[1:18:49] reaction would be to pull back
[1:18:52] come on friends sometimes in situations
[1:18:55] and that's where the test comes think
[1:18:57] about what job said his way of kept I'm
[1:19:00] not declined I've not gone back from his
[1:19:02] Commandments I've esteemed the words of
[1:19:04] his mouth more than my necessary food
[1:19:06] when we're seeing situations that are
[1:19:09] taking place in order to walk up to that
[1:19:13] situation
[1:19:14] you've got to be certain he's God
[1:19:17] and being certain he's God is not just
[1:19:20] something we read about but then we've
[1:19:22] met him but we also know that in my life
[1:19:25] right now I know I'm standing where God
[1:19:28] has ordained me to stand there's nothing
[1:19:31] between me and him
[1:19:34] anything that he's brought to my
[1:19:36] attention I've made it right I've
[1:19:38] confessed my wrongs I've confessed my
[1:19:40] sin then you can be certain of God why
[1:19:43] because that's where faith faith can't
[1:19:46] operate if there's anything in the way
[1:19:52] understand what the old sleuth's desire
[1:19:55] is is to get our lives Tangled
[1:19:58] is to get things into our lives
[1:19:59] sometimes it can even be funny feelings
[1:20:02] and there's things about it that we need
[1:20:04] to look and say God
[1:20:06] I need your character I believe your
[1:20:10] character of your life is in me Lord and
[1:20:12] I want to die to my way of doing things
[1:20:14] I want to die from way my response is
[1:20:18] Lord I want to die to myself what are
[1:20:20] you doing being certain of God
[1:20:23] so that in the midst of a situation
[1:20:25] we're moving closer and brother Brown
[1:20:27] says then when you can look at that
[1:20:29] picture he said really what it is it was
[1:20:31] a blessing in disguise
[1:20:34] the Gloom itself
[1:20:36] the Gloom was actually a blessing in
[1:20:40] disguise but from a long distance it
[1:20:42] looks horrible
[1:20:45] let me say this no matter your trouble
[1:20:47] no matter your test and let me just say
[1:20:49] it
[1:20:50] if we've God is a god of faithfulness
[1:20:53] he's the god of mastery if we fail to
[1:20:56] test there'll be a repeat
[1:20:59] there'll be a repeat you think oh my
[1:21:01] Lord no it's a God oh my Lord mold me
[1:21:06] help me to grow from this
[1:21:09] see God God's word you you say look the
[1:21:12] same man why would he do that because
[1:21:13] you're a part of God God's word in you
[1:21:15] and God can't fail
[1:21:18] God's word has never been defeated
[1:21:22] and I'd say God help me what is real
[1:21:24] perfect Faith relying on what he has
[1:21:28] made you
[1:21:30] that's what the Lord Jesus walked in a
[1:21:33] world of perfect Faith because he relied
[1:21:37] on what his father made him
[1:21:42] to me that's a that's a powerful
[1:21:43] statement that we could just sit down
[1:21:45] and just say God help that to just sink
[1:21:47] deep in my heart
[1:21:49] rely upon what God has made us rely upon
[1:21:52] the god that has changed your life
[1:21:56] and what he's done in your life how he's
[1:21:58] changed you how he's brought you from
[1:22:00] just a creature of time that's walking
[1:22:02] in this realm and all you see is this
[1:22:05] realm but now you're aware there's
[1:22:08] another realm that's present a living
[1:22:10] God that's present what is it it's a
[1:22:13] world of perfect faith and you're
[1:22:16] relying not upon yourself but upon what
[1:22:20] he has made you
[1:22:24] that's faith
[1:22:27] oh my God help us help us Lord Jesus I
[1:22:32] want to just I want just trying to bring
[1:22:34] this down here
[1:22:36] this is where Paul would say in second
[1:22:37] Thessalonians 3 1 finally Brethren pray
[1:22:40] for us that the word of the Lord may
[1:22:42] have free course I say yet Grant it Lord
[1:22:45] pray for me that the word hath free
[1:22:47] course I pray for you the word would
[1:22:49] have free course and be glorified even
[1:22:51] as it is with you that we may be
[1:22:54] delivered from unreasonable and wicked
[1:22:56] men let's say Amen Lord help me to know
[1:22:59] Lord when I'm in that kind of a place
[1:23:00] help me Lord is that right Paul Paul and
[1:23:04] Paul admonish the people in Timothy hey
[1:23:05] don't get caught up in Endless
[1:23:07] genealogies and trying to prove this and
[1:23:09] I'm going to debate him on the website
[1:23:11] forget about it God never called us to
[1:23:13] debate and try to prove somebody wrong
[1:23:15] because you're not going to turn anybody
[1:23:17] around anyhow with any kind of debate
[1:23:20] is that right it'll take the spirit of
[1:23:22] almighty God we can be as slick as we
[1:23:24] can be with our words but do you realize
[1:23:27] it'll never be words that'll ever turn
[1:23:30] anybody
[1:23:31] it will take the supernatural working of
[1:23:34] almighty God to turn the heart of a
[1:23:37] person
[1:23:38] is that right now notice this
[1:23:41] for all men have not Faith verse 3 but
[1:23:43] the Lord is faithful who shall establish
[1:23:47] you and keep you from evil thank you
[1:23:50] Lord
[1:23:51] it's rest he'll continue to establish US
[1:23:54] settle us and keep us from evil and we
[1:23:57] have confidence in the Lord touching you
[1:24:00] notice how Paul writes this Paul didn't
[1:24:02] say we have confidence in you
[1:24:04] we have confidence in the Lord touching
[1:24:07] you in other words you're his
[1:24:10] you he has touched you through the
[1:24:13] ministry that he has delegated he Paul
[1:24:16] could say in that he has delegated
[1:24:18] through me as a vessel but you are God's
[1:24:20] working you're his workmanship so we've
[1:24:23] got confidence in the Lord touching you
[1:24:26] that no matter what we can't see but you
[1:24:29] belong to him and it's God working in
[1:24:32] your life so our confidence is in the
[1:24:35] Lord
[1:24:36] that ye both do and will do the things
[1:24:39] which we command you and the Lord direct
[1:24:43] your hearts
[1:24:45] into the love of God
[1:24:48] well I thought they were already in the
[1:24:50] love of God they were but do you realize
[1:24:52] the word keeps leading us deeper
[1:24:55] it'll continue notice what the Lord will
[1:24:58] do he won't direct us away
[1:25:01] it'll direct us further into the love of
[1:25:03] God
[1:25:05] and into the patient waiting for Christ
[1:25:09] now notice in second Corinthians chapter
[1:25:11] four I'm trying to get somewhere second
[1:25:13] Corinthians chapter 4 verse 13. now
[1:25:15] remember Paul's just wrote about here of
[1:25:17] this of this Excellency of God's power
[1:25:20] in Earth and vessels
[1:25:23] what a contrast
[1:25:25] you know to think about you put the
[1:25:28] glorious power of deity
[1:25:31] in fragile
[1:25:33] frail
[1:25:34] Earthen vessels vessels that
[1:25:39] not like the plastic ones from Lowe's
[1:25:40] but pots that if you don't
[1:25:44] set them down just right
[1:25:46] if you drop them
[1:25:48] they'll break
[1:25:50] and God has so placed his spirit
[1:25:54] inside of Earthen vessels
[1:25:58] now there's probably no doubt not one of
[1:26:00] us in here but hasn't felt like
[1:26:02] sometimes that we have been broke all to
[1:26:05] pieces
[1:26:07] and there's no doubt maybe our flesh has
[1:26:09] maybe our spirit has
[1:26:12] but that Inside Man
[1:26:14] and that's who you really are
[1:26:16] it's God that's holding you together
[1:26:20] that's the Paradox that through every
[1:26:22] situation it's the power of God that's
[1:26:26] holding you together as a matter of fact
[1:26:28] that's the very word remember how God
[1:26:30] would tell Joshua Don't Be Afraid don't
[1:26:32] be dismayed he would say that over and
[1:26:34] over the word dismayed means not to be
[1:26:37] broke into pieces
[1:26:40] God knows how to keep us together
[1:26:43] to me that's a Marvel and a miracle at
[1:26:45] times when I feel like I've went to
[1:26:47] pieces I feel like that ever I feel like
[1:26:49] everything is shattered maybe within you
[1:26:51] know you're broken maybe in your spirit
[1:26:53] you're discouraged but there is Faith on
[1:26:57] the inside there's something Beyond the
[1:27:01] Veil that holds you and I
[1:27:03] something that you can explain I can't
[1:27:06] explain it's the Excellency of the power
[1:27:09] of God
[1:27:11] now notice how Paul would write this in
[1:27:13] verse 13 we having the same Spirit of
[1:27:17] Faith same faith that all before have
[1:27:20] had what is it the same spirit
[1:27:24] of Faith God's life according as it is
[1:27:27] written I believed and therefore have I
[1:27:29] spoken we also believe and therefore
[1:27:31] speak knowing that he which raised up
[1:27:34] the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
[1:27:38] Jesus and shall present us with you so
[1:27:41] Paul is not saying we know that we're
[1:27:44] going to be brought out of this
[1:27:45] situation as far as alive but what he is
[1:27:48] saying is that one thing we know there
[1:27:51] is nothing can hinder what God has done
[1:27:54] in our soul
[1:27:55] I don't know what the next move is we're
[1:27:58] persecuted all around but we ain't
[1:28:00] forsaken
[1:28:02] there is an assurance of faith
[1:28:06] that brings faithfulness in the midst of
[1:28:09] these times and it speaks that way what
[1:28:11] is it it's the spirit of Faith operating
[1:28:15] in our life
[1:28:16] I'm sure every one of us have testified
[1:28:18] to this that there's things that you
[1:28:20] have spoke that as far as in your
[1:28:23] natural feelings you didn't feel a bit
[1:28:25] more spiritual than nothing you didn't
[1:28:27] feel a bit more Victorious than nothing
[1:28:29] but there is a resolve within your heart
[1:28:32] that says I know my redeemer lives I
[1:28:35] know God is working this out right now
[1:28:38] what is it it's where you're going
[1:28:40] beyond your feelings because let's face
[1:28:43] it friends it's only when we're on the
[1:28:45] top of the mountain that our feelings
[1:28:46] are where they need to be but which when
[1:28:48] we're in the valley God proves himself
[1:28:51] in the times of the valley it's the
[1:28:53] times we need the spirit of faith that
[1:28:56] we speak according to the revelation of
[1:28:59] God's faith in our heart that's why the
[1:29:02] prophet there in the fifth seal said I
[1:29:05] am going to speak this according to the
[1:29:08] revelation of my faith
[1:29:11] I am
[1:29:13] part of the rapture
[1:29:18] going in a rapture
[1:29:22] [Applause]
[1:29:25] I am set free
[1:29:27] he is my helper I am healed foreign
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:35] that's just a bunch of workups shame on
[1:29:37] you
[1:29:39] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:29:42] not the high priest of our feelings
[1:29:46] right he's touched by the feelings of
[1:29:50] our weaknesses it's your needs that's
[1:29:54] brought him here tonight
[1:29:57] he hasn't come here tonight to put on a
[1:29:59] show he's come here tonight because
[1:30:01] you're and my infirmities have drawn
[1:30:05] upon him
[1:30:07] and he's touched
[1:30:09] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:30:16] glory be to God
[1:30:20] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:30:22] oh my this is why faith
[1:30:25] Brothers sees the resurrection a god of
[1:30:27] Resurrection That's The Power of Faith
[1:30:30] to believe when standing over behind the
[1:30:33] Dark Cloud that you can't see with your
[1:30:35] natural eyes but Faith standing by you
[1:30:38] directs you to that God of resurrection
[1:30:41] and a God of all wisdom who has ordained
[1:30:44] our path he's standing just behind every
[1:30:49] trial
[1:30:51] I love that faith standing by my side
[1:30:57] I'm not alone
[1:30:59] it's Faith you understand it's Faith
[1:31:01] that's directing us
[1:31:04] I got a little down when this situation
[1:31:07] came along when the doctors read me this
[1:31:09] report the fear first came along and you
[1:31:11] know the devil's just been telling me I
[1:31:12] ain't nothing but an unbeliever I know
[1:31:14] why are you repeating what a liar would
[1:31:16] say
[1:31:18] fear will come doubt can come but there
[1:31:22] is a power on the inside there is a
[1:31:25] faith to direct you that the Lord is my
[1:31:29] deliverer
[1:31:31] sure your humanity is there to pick
[1:31:34] those things up but the god part
[1:31:38] that faith on the inside is there to
[1:31:41] direct you and I hate wait a minute
[1:31:45] God has never failed
[1:31:49] though you can't see it through the
[1:31:51] doctor's report but he's standing right
[1:31:53] behind it
[1:31:54] though you can't see it through that
[1:31:56] cloud but he's standing right behind
[1:31:57] that cloud
[1:32:03] let me just close with this here
[1:32:06] thank you Father God
[1:32:09] it's a story
[1:32:14] it's a story it says one day a young
[1:32:16] lady
[1:32:17] was driving along with her father
[1:32:20] and They Came Upon a storm
[1:32:23] and the young lady asked her father
[1:32:25] what should I do
[1:32:27] he said
[1:32:29] keep driving
[1:32:30] cars begin to pull over to the side the
[1:32:34] storm was getting worse what should I do
[1:32:36] the young lady asked keep driving
[1:32:39] her father replied on up a few feet she
[1:32:43] noticed that 18 wheelers that semis were
[1:32:46] also pulling over she told her dad I
[1:32:49] must pull over you see what's happening
[1:32:52] she sees the cars the storm what must I
[1:32:55] do keep going
[1:32:57] she's cars pulling over this car is
[1:32:59] pulling over
[1:33:00] this one's leaving
[1:33:01] this one's turning us on what should I
[1:33:04] do keep driving
[1:33:06] keep going now 18 wheelers
[1:33:11] preachers
[1:33:14] bigger things they're pulling over I
[1:33:16] mean you know when you're driving the
[1:33:17] storm hey if 18 wheelers are pulling
[1:33:19] over in a snowstorm you kind of get the
[1:33:21] thinking I might as well find somewhere
[1:33:23] to pull over
[1:33:24] right so here it is the pressure of what
[1:33:28] she's seeing all around her
[1:33:30] she noticed 18 wheelers were also
[1:33:32] pulling over she told her dad I must
[1:33:34] pull over I can barely see ahead it is
[1:33:37] terrible and everyone is pulling over
[1:33:39] her father told her don't give up just
[1:33:43] keep driving
[1:33:45] now the storm was terrible but she never
[1:33:48] stopped and soon she could see a little
[1:33:51] more clearly after a couple miles she
[1:33:54] was again on dry land and the sun came
[1:33:57] out her father said now you can pull
[1:34:00] over and get out
[1:34:02] she said but why now he said when you
[1:34:05] get out look back at all the people that
[1:34:08] gave up and are still in the storm
[1:34:10] because you never gave up your stormy is
[1:34:14] now over
[1:34:17] [Applause]
[1:34:21] keep driving
[1:34:23] faith of the faith will keep driving
[1:34:27] no matter if you all walk away I'm gonna
[1:34:30] keep driving
[1:34:32] we're going to keep going
[1:34:34] hey man keep going but 18 we're gonna
[1:34:36] keep going
[1:34:38] and then as you're out of the storm you
[1:34:40] can look back
[1:34:42] because your Storm's over
[1:34:45] well I think not only in this moment
[1:34:48] but I think one of these mornings
[1:34:50] no wonder Paul could write
[1:34:52] the things that we're facing are not
[1:34:54] even Worthy
[1:34:56] to be compared with the glory that shall
[1:34:59] be revealed in US
[1:35:01] I say God keep me true Lord
[1:35:04] keep me true Lord help me to keep my
[1:35:07] eyes on the Eastern Sky help me just
[1:35:09] Lord the key stay focused on the coming
[1:35:11] of the Lord many distractions that's
[1:35:14] true 18 wheelers cars everything else
[1:35:16] but let us just stay faithful and with
[1:35:19] every step of the way what God knows
[1:35:21] just what we have need of Lord help me
[1:35:24] to stay as a channel
[1:35:25] that's my prayer
[1:35:27] I think it'd be good if we pray for one
[1:35:29] another tonight Lord help us to remain
[1:35:31] as channels
[1:35:33] that are free
[1:35:35] for Faith to move I want to walk as an
[1:35:38] unconscious Son of God
[1:35:41] unconscious of fear unconscious of
[1:35:45] failure
[1:35:47] but under the Dominion
[1:35:49] of the love of God
[1:35:51] what his love
[1:35:53] has made me
[1:35:55] where he took me from many people were
[1:35:58] in the same pit
[1:36:00] but he lifted you and me
[1:36:03] out of that pit
[1:36:05] he lifted us I didn't lift myself you
[1:36:07] didn't lift yourself he lifted us yes
[1:36:11] that's love
[1:36:13] not what I deserved not what you
[1:36:15] deserved but that's what his love
[1:36:18] has done for us
[1:36:21] what a precious thing it is to walk with
[1:36:23] god let's pray our heads in prayer
[1:36:26] Heavenly Father
[1:36:31] Faith Lord
[1:36:33] of the faithful
[1:36:37] I'm certain Lord that as we
[1:36:40] will stand there on that day
[1:36:42] it'll be very much like the Lord we feel
[1:36:44] right now in our hearts this evening
[1:36:49] that God we can look back over our lives
[1:36:52] and know that Lord It's Your Grace
[1:36:54] that's been provided
[1:36:56] to bring us to this moment
[1:36:59] Lord your faith
[1:37:01] Lord how you've come down and operated
[1:37:04] on our faith
[1:37:05] I pray that God that here tonight if
[1:37:08] there's one that has not had that
[1:37:09] operation on their faith may they Lord
[1:37:12] take the promise of the Living God as
[1:37:15] you've made yourself real to us right
[1:37:18] here tonight and the promise Lord
[1:37:20] that God you're a stabilizer
[1:37:23] you are the one who stabilizes our life
[1:37:25] Lord
[1:37:26] you come down lord and you raise our
[1:37:28] life that Faith from where it's just up
[1:37:31] and down and in and out Lord and
[1:37:33] wondering to where it becomes stable not
[1:37:37] because of our mind
[1:37:40] but because of your faith
[1:37:43] Lord God of that experience like Moses
[1:37:47] your Prophet would tell us Lord Moses
[1:37:51] had great faith
[1:37:55] but he needed his faith
[1:37:57] to be anointed
[1:38:01] and when he got in the presence of the
[1:38:03] burning bush
[1:38:04] his faith
[1:38:06] became anointed
[1:38:08] by the revelation of God the faith of
[1:38:11] God
[1:38:13] and when that anointing came
[1:38:16] he did not come upon a man who thought
[1:38:18] he could do something
[1:38:20] but rather in your presence
[1:38:23] is where he realized like Isaiah and
[1:38:26] like the rest of us Lord
[1:38:29] I'm unfit in myself
[1:38:33] to do what you have ordained to be done
[1:38:38] but Lord
[1:38:40] the same way you did with Moses the same
[1:38:43] way with Isaiah the same with each of us
[1:38:45] and really Lord that work from the New
[1:38:49] Birth then on through our life is you
[1:38:52] drawing us into that place
[1:38:55] to rely upon you
[1:38:58] Lord that's what the blessing and
[1:39:00] invitation of the new birth is is to
[1:39:02] where that we no longer
[1:39:04] have to rely
[1:39:06] upon our way
[1:39:08] upon our own self
[1:39:12] but where Lord we are relying
[1:39:15] upon you relying upon what you have made
[1:39:18] us what you have brought to pass in our
[1:39:21] life and we rely
[1:39:23] upon you Lord
[1:39:25] father I pray tonight Lord grant it Lord
[1:39:28] May Lord if there's one here that has
[1:39:31] not had that experience yet that
[1:39:34] operation upon their faith may they Lord
[1:39:36] realize that it's worth more to seek
[1:39:39] after that to seek after you
[1:39:42] then anything of this world
[1:39:45] because the temporal things will soon
[1:39:48] fade away
[1:39:49] it will soon be filled with rust and
[1:39:52] Decay it'll become of no value what
[1:39:55] value we hold in it now will be lost
[1:39:59] but Lord God
[1:40:01] it's those things that are eternal
[1:40:04] that's what really matters Lord
[1:40:08] granted I pray father this evening
[1:40:11] Lord as we take encouragement from your
[1:40:13] word Lord
[1:40:15] and like job to be able to stand with
[1:40:17] this comfort in our lives
[1:40:20] Lord Jesus
[1:40:22] your Wayne
[1:40:24] have we kept Lord help us Lord help us
[1:40:27] that in the midst of situations your
[1:40:30] Prophet would tell us to conduct
[1:40:32] ourselves with joy
[1:40:35] to conduct ourselves as Sons and
[1:40:39] Daughters of God
[1:40:42] granted Lord Jesus Lord sometimes it's
[1:40:45] not the easiest thing Lord our flesh is
[1:40:47] pulled many different ways we're
[1:40:50] honest about that Lord but father
[1:40:54] our desire Lord and where the victory is
[1:40:57] is we yield
[1:40:58] to that inner man Lord
[1:41:00] and by faith bring the outside man and
[1:41:05] every feeling in subjection to the word
[1:41:08] of God
[1:41:09] help us Lord may we stand may each and
[1:41:12] every one of us hear Lord stand as
[1:41:14] channels that's lord of the hands that
[1:41:16] were lifted up along with my hands Lord
[1:41:18] we want to remain as channels Lord that
[1:41:21] are free
[1:41:22] that are clear that can walk Lord as
[1:41:25] Sons and Daughters of God unconscious of
[1:41:28] fear and failure
[1:41:31] but Lord God walking in that world of a
[1:41:34] perfect Faith walking Lord Jesus with
[1:41:38] you Lord
[1:41:39] help us Lord maybe there's one here
[1:41:42] tonight Lord where the picture looks
[1:41:43] awful gloomy but God I pray father may
[1:41:47] you Lord move down for them in a special
[1:41:49] way Lord if there's anything Lord that's
[1:41:51] wrong Lord to know that God that you are
[1:41:54] mindful Lord when we have confessed our
[1:41:56] wrongs Lord and made restitution that
[1:41:58] Lord Jesus then we can stand upon that
[1:42:01] word being certain that you are God and
[1:42:03] our faith Lord God being able to stand
[1:42:06] there o God and say Lord though I see
[1:42:09] clouds that look terrible but oh God I'm
[1:42:14] going to walk closer as the god of the
[1:42:16] holy spirit is bidding me to come closer
[1:42:20] to realize there is blessings
[1:42:24] though in disguisement but yet blessings
[1:42:27] help us tonight father we pray may we
[1:42:30] draw nearer Lord draw nearer I pray in
[1:42:34] Jesus name
