[36:48] other faces - and it's so good to see
[36:50] each and every one of you
[36:54] heart

[37:02] living in it really it means so much to
[37:05] us that he is ever-present in leading us
[37:09] on
[37:11] want to just read in these scriptures
[37:14] where we were last week we could just
[37:18] start here in verse 4
[37:22] and Peter here writing my inspiration so
[37:25] to whom coming as unto a lying son
[37:29] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[37:32] God and precious ye also as lively
[37:37] stones are built up a spiritual house a
[37:41] holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[37:45] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[37:48] Christ
[37:49] wherefore also it is contained in the
[37:52] scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief
[37:56] Cornerstone he lacked and precious and
[38:00] he that believeth on him shall not be
[38:04] confounded
[38:05] unto you therefore which believe he is
[38:09] precious let me say amen to that that's
[38:12] a truth but unto them which be
[38:14] disobedient the stone which the builders
[38:16] disallowed the same has made the head of
[38:20] the corner and a stone of stumbling and
[38:23] a rock of offence even to them which
[38:26] stumble at the word being disobedient
[38:28] where and who also they were appointed
[38:31] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[38:35] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[38:39] people that that term peculiar does not
[38:43] mean strange or odd it meant it means
[38:47] you've been at all to someone
[38:52] you belong to someone
[38:54] that you should show forth the praises
[38:58] of him who hath called you out of
[39:02] darkness into his marvelous light which
[39:07] in time past were not a people but are
[39:10] now the people of God which had not
[39:15] obtained mercy but now have obtained
[39:18] mercy

[40:38] vegetation or the blossoms or the fruit
[40:41] or whatever it might be that it would
[40:44] come we know Lord that by the grace of
[40:46] God that we are living in the season of
[40:50] the rapture Lord we're living in the
[40:53] season of the coming of the Lord and we
[40:56] just ask God for your grace Lord that
[40:59] you might help us Lord in these moments
[41:01] and in these closing times God may we be
[41:04] ever
[41:05] near to you Lord may we be found worthy
[41:09] Lord to escape those things Lord that
[41:12] are coming upon the earth
[41:13] Lord we see little minor glimpses Lord
[41:17] but all God were thankful that Lord
[41:20] Jesus that there is a greater focus a
[41:23] greater voice there is a true light that
[41:26] has come Lord to take a hold and to
[41:29] guide us safely home Lord we just ask
[41:33] that you were just now anoint our lips
[41:35] anoint our ears o God I ask if there's
[41:39] one here this morning that doesn't know
[41:43] you
[41:43] may father I pray you just move right to
[41:48] their heart Lord and may they all God
[41:51] and humility respond to the knock of the
[41:54] Holy Spirit upon their heart Lord for
[41:58] there's no greater visitation Lord then
[42:01] you would come Lord and speak to us Lord
[42:04] and do a work in our lives we need you
[42:07] father we just commit ourselves in your
[42:09] hands now in the name of Jesus Christ
[42:12] amen
[42:13] may God bless you as you're being seated
[42:16] I
[42:17] want to if God will help us just to
[42:20] continue to
[42:22] look at that thought as we've been on
[42:27] stability in the midst of instability
[42:31] and also where we were last Sunday on
[42:35] never ashamed and
[42:38] this scripture as a scripture that is
[42:42] just so
[42:45] just so seemingly sets the course and
[42:48] speaks to such depth in our life when we
[42:50] we read through these scriptures that we
[42:54] have here before us that we read in the
[42:56] text when we look at it if then as far
[43:00] as our lives would go we are no
[43:04] different as far as than any other other
[43:06] human being we are we are no more than
[43:10] any other human being you and I could
[43:13] not make the difference in our life but
[43:15] God is the one who has made the
[43:18] difference
[43:19] you take him away from our lives and
[43:22] we're like everybody else
[43:25] you remove him this church is like any
[43:28] other Church
[43:31] he's the one who makes the difference
[43:36] we were always a part of him this is
[43:39] what the Scriptures
[43:41] are speaking to us we were always a part
[43:45] of him
[43:47] these are something that God brings to
[43:50] us as a reality that
[43:52] there is a greater identity that we have
[43:56] received than anything of this earth
[44:01] the world wants to assign identities but
[44:06] God has given us a true identity and
[44:11] this is why that we are admonished by
[44:15] the Spirit we are sons and daughters of
[44:18] God and they just say it first of all
[44:21] above everything else
[44:23] we are first
[44:26] Christians
[44:30] are you hearing me we are first of all
[44:33] sons and daughters of God you remember
[44:37] the Spirit of God as he moved in and
[44:39] even in this age and
[44:42] it was
[44:44] it was expressing to us that even that
[44:50] when Eve she did not even have her own
[44:52] name and her own identity until she had
[44:56] fallen
[44:57] she was identified completely by Adam's
[45:01] name
[45:03] God called Adam they both responded then
[45:07] we find that every time that even when
[45:10] God would give light and show light once
[45:14] if the people fail to walk on with that
[45:16] light then the people would take an
[45:19] identity of a name and they would
[45:22] associate with something that was in the
[45:24] past instead of being United with a
[45:27] living God who was present
[45:30] let me just say it very clearly it's not
[45:34] our precepts it's not our pretense it's
[45:36] not all any of those things that
[45:38] separate us it's his presence coming
[45:42] through his word in our life that gives
[45:45] us a true identity
[45:47] when someone looks at me there's one
[45:50] thing and this ought to be the desire
[45:51] above in all of your life that the first
[45:54] thing that they notice about your life
[45:56] you're a Christian
[45:59] that's the first thing that we desire
[46:01] God let there be such a life such a
[46:04] presence that they would recognize we
[46:06] are we are a Christian and these are
[46:10] things that when the scripture is making
[46:13] clear to us here and I want to just draw
[46:16] our attention in this part in verse 6
[46:18] behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone
[46:23] elect and precious and he that believeth
[46:26] on him shall not be confounded
[46:30] shall not be ashamed
[46:33] whosoever believeth on him let me read
[46:37] the scripture where we're here where
[46:39] Peter Paul would pull from this same
[46:42] scripture as the Spirit of God would
[46:44] quicken to their hearts and it would
[46:46] speak in isaiah 28:16 therefore thus
[46:50] saith the lord god behold I lay in Zion
[46:53] for a foundation a stone a tried stone a
[46:58] precious cornerstone a sure foundation
[47:02] and he that believeth shall not make
[47:04] haste
[47:06] he will not be impatient with waiting on
[47:10] the fulfillment of the word
[47:13] because we have a foundation and so
[47:17] within this there is undoubtedly that as
[47:21] we speak throughout the congregation
[47:23] there's a lot of things that even when
[47:26] it comes down to things that you've
[47:29] prayed about or I prayed about or what
[47:31] we're looking for there can even be
[47:33] parts about it where we can have certain
[47:37] ideas or certain thoughts or even when
[47:39] we're praying God that it would come
[47:42] this way or it would work out this way
[47:44] but yet as a believer the greatest thing
[47:48] that we can do is to be resolved and
[47:52] reserved to say Lord this is things that
[47:55] I don't know how you're going to work it
[47:58] out but I'm just gonna look to you and
[48:00] I'm asking that you will give me the
[48:02] grace to follow you and to just be the
[48:06] present to recognize you when you come
[48:09] to fulfill your word in that pathway in
[48:12] that channel because that has been what
[48:14] has happened in all through history has
[48:17] been where individuals have taken a
[48:19] scripture and they have so figured it
[48:21] out based on their mind and yet when it
[48:25] didn't happen that way they stumbled at
[48:28] the very word that they said they were
[48:30] looking for they stumbled at it but here
[48:33] God's grace with your I let me just say
[48:36] if not for God's grace there is an
[48:39] election
[48:41] it is God in His grace that would move
[48:43] down because some of you some of us that
[48:46] I'm speaking to you had no background of
[48:49] God whatsoever in your life there was
[48:52] and maybe even anything you could hang
[48:54] your hat on but God who is rich in mercy
[48:57] it wasn't about how much background you
[49:00] had you had a greater background that
[49:04] you did not even know about
[49:07] you were chosen in Christ
[49:11] before the foundation of the world let
[49:14] me just say this to you this world is
[49:17] not what holds the answer or make sense
[49:22] of your life
[49:23] [Music]
[49:25] this world is built on the pretense of
[49:29] confusion
[49:32] that's what happened that's why it's
[49:35] called Babylon her religion has brought
[49:38] confusion
[49:40] dissimulation division emulation that is
[49:44] the results of her religion
[49:47] there's two spiritual powers at work
[49:51] here in this earth
[49:53] there's only one that can hold and
[49:57] release to us our true identity and who
[50:00] we are and may God help us let that
[50:03] voice drowned out every other voice and
[50:07] that's his voice
[50:09] he is the final authority
[50:19] Romans 10:10
[50:23] familiar scripture for with the heart
[50:27] man
[50:28] believeth unto righteousness
[50:32] and
[50:33] with the mouth confession is made unto
[50:37] salvation
[50:39] simply put God deals with your heart
[50:43] first and
[50:45] God dealing with your heart it's God
[50:48] building your heart into a place to
[50:51] believe on him
[50:56] it's his work it's him coming through
[51:00] his word then as he touches that life as
[51:03] he moves upon our life and listen please
[51:05] do not just leave this scripture let's
[51:07] go upon a manner of someone just coming
[51:10] to salvation let the scripture be
[51:12] applicable to every part of your life
[51:14] when you've got needs I've got needs in
[51:16] my life we need God we need his faith to
[51:19] move down and to stir our faith because
[51:23] after afterwards then as were standing
[51:26] with the mouth confession is made what
[51:28] are we confessing we're confessing to
[51:31] him who has touched our heart and what
[51:33] he has delivered to us and that's what
[51:35] we're confessing and listen as you
[51:37] confess as the Prophet with jealousy
[51:40] says you give your life to God and a
[51:42] real faith in that your life is being
[51:45] gift to God and you go out with the
[51:47] confession you watch he said your life
[51:49] from that moment on will go up as you
[51:52] confess and you look to others and say
[51:54] God touch my life I've been saved he
[51:58] said it'll work salvation and if it
[52:01] works that way it's the same way if you
[52:03] take and you take your mouth and you go
[52:05] the opposite way it will bring defeat
[52:10] that's why jesus said by their words
[52:13] thou shalt either be justified or
[52:15] condemned
[52:17] wonder David would say set a guard over
[52:20] my mouth Lord
[52:23] then it comes into Romans 10 11 for the
[52:27] scripture says whosoever believeth on
[52:30] him shall not be ashamed a person that
[52:34] says I've been saved they'll not be
[52:36] ashamed
[52:37] they know I've been saved I've repented
[52:40] of my sins I've been saved God has
[52:44] forgiven me
[52:45] God comes down and cleanses that that
[52:48] heart from all of the habits of the sin
[52:53] of the world there's coward out they can
[52:55] stand on that and say he has cleansed me
[52:59] he sent me free
[53:01] crud comes down and he feels that life
[53:05] they can say God has completely changed
[53:08] me he's brought a complete change in my
[53:11] life he did something that I could never
[53:14] do there's something within me that just
[53:16] says amen to the Word of God
[53:20] you'll never be ashamed
[53:23] never be ashamed
[53:26] now
[53:27] with never being ashamed let's bring
[53:31] this into where we were leaving off last
[53:34] week in this account in second
[53:37] chronicles 32 and I want to look at this
[53:42] here this morning
[53:45] because to never be ashamed to have that
[53:48] that anchor to have that that hold in
[53:52] the Lord and I want you to notice
[53:55] carefully these words in second
[53:58] chronicles 32 verse 1 after these things
[54:02] and the establishment thereof
[54:05] and there's a very peculiar part in
[54:08] Scripture you'll notice even in the Book
[54:10] of Revelations where it would speak to
[54:13] us concerning great visitations after
[54:16] these things
[54:19] what after what things Hezekiah when you
[54:24] read back in the scripture Israel there
[54:26] had already been a pronouncement of
[54:28] judgment that was coming that was you're
[54:32] not going to escape that judgment it was
[54:34] already pronounced but here a haze a
[54:37] haze this is his father passes away but
[54:41] Hezekiah he's moved by the Lord and
[54:45] Hezekiah sees where Israel has fallen
[54:48] away from the standard the house of the
[54:50] Lord is forsaken now people are just
[54:53] going about their ways and the priests
[54:55] are out in the field working and there's
[54:57] pollution even in the house of God
[55:00] there's pollution throughout the land of
[55:02] Israel and Hezekiah he begins to if you
[55:06] you read maybe when you get home and you
[55:08] read through first chronicles 28 and so
[55:10] forth you'll find that even up to this
[55:12] place he moves under a burden to be able
[55:16] to set the order back to a place that
[55:19] would invite the presence of God even
[55:22] the offering of the sacrifice and when
[55:24] you look even in your bibles if you have
[55:26] him open you'll notice that the
[55:28] scripture right above this at the end of
[55:31] second chronicles 31 is where after
[55:34] those things were done that there was
[55:36] such a joy that had come in the Land of
[55:40] Israel like it was in the days of
[55:42] Solomon
[55:44] true joy is not something that the world
[55:49] can give and no we under I know we hear
[55:52] that a million times but I'm just
[55:53] telling you there's only one thing that
[55:55] will bring joy and that's getting lined
[55:57] up with the word
[55:59] that's the only thing that's real joy
[56:02] it'll be you know when you were lined up
[56:04] with the word and now after these things
[56:07] my what a lining up with the word but
[56:10] here comes Satan to to try to sort that
[56:14] and to bring a test against that and the
[56:18] Bible says Sennacherib king of Assyria
[56:20] came and entered into Judah and encamped
[56:23] against the fence cities and thought to
[56:26] win them for himself and when Hezekiah
[56:29] saw that Sennacherib was come and that
[56:32] he purposed to fight against Jerusalem
[56:34] he took counsel with his princes and his
[56:37] mighty men to stop the waters of the
[56:39] fountains which were without the city
[56:41] and they did help him so there was
[56:44] gathered much people together who
[56:46] stopped all the fountains and the brook
[56:49] that ran through the midst of the land
[56:50] saying why should the kings of Assyria
[56:53] come and find much water
[56:56] and where we were at as last week the
[56:59] simplicity is the first of all Hezekiah
[57:03] after all this is done think of it a
[57:07] revival has struck Israel
[57:10] but it did not remove him pending
[57:12] judgment
[57:15] but there are some key words that
[57:17] Hezekiah says and I don't have time to
[57:20] read them but I if you allow me just to
[57:21] quote them and paraphrase them out of
[57:24] chapter 30 there are there are those
[57:27] that he sends throughout Israel to cause
[57:29] the people to come in to sacrifice there
[57:32] are many out of some of those tribes
[57:34] they said they would not even heed to
[57:37] the words of the king's commandments but
[57:39] they laughed him to scorn
[57:41] but Hezekiah stood up and he's he he
[57:44] implores he speaks even to the parents
[57:47] he speaks personally to the parents he
[57:50] speaks to the whole county said look
[57:52] we're not going to get away from this
[57:54] judgment but what we can do right now is
[57:57] see to it that God will bring our
[57:59] children and plant them back into the
[58:02] lamb you know that was that was a man
[58:05] that was in tune with God to know that
[58:07] God will not forsake his word
[58:11] so everything look bleak it looked dark
[58:14] but Hezekiah said let your focus right
[58:17] now don't try to judge the judgment
[58:20] don't try to get around it don't try to
[58:22] sort it don't try your own means in your
[58:24] own measures he's letting them know live
[58:27] not for the present but live for the
[58:30] future
[58:32] but God will bring your children back
[58:36] into this land let me just tell you
[58:39] something you've heard this statement
[58:40] brother Branham says how you think about
[58:42] Jesus Christ will affect your
[58:45] grandchildren is that right
[58:48] just as much as people's actions and
[58:51] things like that it can fall down in
[58:53] generations and what about reaching back
[58:55] to that of Levi Levi paid to pay paid
[58:58] ties why in the loins of Abraham God
[59:01] allotted it to him they paid tithes to
[59:03] Melchizedek why God knew what Levi would
[59:06] do he knew and Levi was that when this
[59:08] was his great-grandfather paying the
[59:10] tithe
[59:12] this is why you think God doesn't think
[59:14] this important when it came to a time in
[59:16] the daughters of Zelophehad
[59:18] they had there was nobody to stand for
[59:21] their inheritance they needed a man to
[59:23] stand for their inheritance there was no
[59:25] man to stand but they came to Moses they
[59:28] came to Joshua and they said that
[59:30] remembers how our Father stood in the
[59:33] days when the tests came and they said
[59:36] you cannot take the land our Father was
[59:39] not whistles unbelievers he stood with
[59:41] the word of the Lord let me tell you
[59:43] something that had an impression on the
[59:46] daughters of Zelophehad when push comes
[59:49] to shove that's the ground they were
[59:51] gonna stand on why that's the only share
[59:55] foundation
[59:59] whoo I will fill I have an appraised
[1:00:02] breaking singing a song this is how I
[1:00:04] fight my battles
[1:00:09] this is our foundation
[1:00:19] we're living in a world that isn't that
[1:00:21] has rejected God
[1:00:23] they do not like to retain God in their
[1:00:26] mind
[1:00:28] they've rejected him all together and
[1:00:34] God has rejected them
[1:00:37] there's still mercy I
[1:00:40] said there's still mercy judgements on
[1:00:42] its way
[1:00:44] judgments coming it's spilling over
[1:00:46] right now
[1:00:48] is that right so they're saying when
[1:00:52] this advancement comes cut off the water
[1:00:55] supply
[1:00:56] in other words breaking it down into our
[1:00:59] everyday daily life
[1:01:01] make the devil when he tries to make his
[1:01:04] advances make him uncomfortable
[1:01:09] [Applause]
[1:01:12] let me ask you how do you cut off the
[1:01:16] water supply well one of the ways is by
[1:01:19] simply not giving it any time but giving
[1:01:21] more time to what's more important
[1:01:24] is that right I mean you cannot starve
[1:01:27] starve the black dog to death if you're
[1:01:29] not feeding the white one
[1:01:31] whoever your feet
[1:01:35] right if you cater towards the things of
[1:01:38] the flesh come on do we live in this
[1:01:40] flesh we walk in this world we're not
[1:01:42] ignorant of Satan's devices his
[1:01:44] objective is to pull us in this realm
[1:01:48] that's his objective that he would pull
[1:01:51] us in this route why as soon as were
[1:01:53] inclined to this realm were defeated
[1:01:56] right then
[1:01:57] on the platform here came the mania here
[1:02:01] came the bull who came to bees if the
[1:02:04] profit moved in entered into that realm
[1:02:06] he was defeated
[1:02:08] what had to happen the one who was
[1:02:10] present who commissioned him that say
[1:02:13] manger of the Lord let me just tell you
[1:02:14] that angel of the Lord did not leave he
[1:02:16] is with the message he is right here
[1:02:20] with this word
[1:02:22] that challenge was not made for the read
[1:02:25] and recognized that challenge was not
[1:02:27] about him he challenged the Holy Ghost
[1:02:30] and that's exactly what Satan wants to
[1:02:34] do and continue to do is to challenge
[1:02:37] the Holy Ghost let
[1:02:39] me remind you demons have been released
[1:02:42] in Revelations not the lid of Hell has
[1:02:47] come off
[1:02:48] but God would not allow it to come off
[1:02:51] if he wasn't prepared to stand there and
[1:02:54] that's so another mighty angel come down
[1:02:59] rather that is the chief captain of the
[1:03:03] Lord's house and we're wondering how do
[1:03:06] I face this panel how do I face this
[1:03:09] right here I'm telling you let's forsake
[1:03:11] earthly means let us be locked in on the
[1:03:15] angel of the Lord
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:18] no wonder the scripture would say in the
[1:03:20] book of Isaiah Isaiah CC for man whose
[1:03:23] breath is in his nostrils
[1:03:32] we ended right here
[1:03:34] last week
[1:03:37] and he strengthened himself
[1:03:39] think of this
[1:03:42] here's a man that's
[1:03:45] been seeing to it not just that his life
[1:03:48] but everything around that he can affect
[1:03:52] by the Carlos everything around is
[1:03:54] getting lined up it's getting lined up
[1:03:57] everything getting lined up but I want
[1:04:00] you to notice he was not this did not
[1:04:03] bring when a man is being lined up with
[1:04:05] God he doesn't bring a false sense of
[1:04:07] security
[1:04:11] it doesn't bring that it brings the
[1:04:14] humility he strengthens himself let me
[1:04:17] just say this to you it brings
[1:04:18] discernment to our lives
[1:04:21] mister you can't we can't cut God and
[1:04:24] say well I just really you know when I
[1:04:26] go to church this is when I'm in contact
[1:04:27] with the spiritual but when you know I I
[1:04:29] come to these things in a natural this
[1:04:31] is where you know I've got to have the
[1:04:32] natural you can't cut God out of your
[1:04:34] life
[1:04:35] you can't cut God out and say God you
[1:04:38] handle this right here but I'll handle
[1:04:39] this right here you can't do that
[1:04:41] he wants to govern and be the Lord of
[1:04:44] all your life if you're gonna try to
[1:04:48] take your life and you're gonna say well
[1:04:49] I'm gonna take this and I'll make it
[1:04:51] come this way you don't have this
[1:04:53] leadership and his blessing and his
[1:04:55] direction
[1:04:57] but how can we how can we tell God Lord
[1:05:01] I know what's best in this situation I
[1:05:04] got this
[1:05:06] hey I know what's best know Hezekiah he
[1:05:10] strengthened himself
[1:05:13] he build up all the wall that was broken
[1:05:16] so he wasn't just sitting around and
[1:05:18] saying I'm elect I've got faith I need
[1:05:23] to build up the wall God will take care
[1:05:25] of me and I have to worry about nothing
[1:05:26] no no it's true gotta provide for all
[1:05:29] your needs but God's also entrusted you
[1:05:31] with the ability to care over your needs
[1:05:36] is that right well God will never see me
[1:05:39] begging that's true that's a promise in
[1:05:41] God's word but neither did does that
[1:05:43] cause you to live Loosli
[1:05:45] hello see all of it's covered within
[1:05:48] God's Word it's all the balance and the
[1:05:50] precepts that lay here now notice he
[1:05:53] raised up to the towers and another wall
[1:05:55] without and repaired Milo in the City of
[1:05:58] David and made darts and shields in
[1:06:00] abundance he is preparing for war
[1:06:03] he's preparing for war these are things
[1:06:07] that God is not going to come down and
[1:06:09] do for him
[1:06:11] got ain't gonna do it he knows what
[1:06:13] needs to be done
[1:06:17] so when we have an expectation
[1:06:21] because he that believeth on him shall
[1:06:23] never be confounded when we have a real
[1:06:25] and expectation we it should be like
[1:06:29] David said my soul wait thou only on God
[1:06:32] for my expectation is from him we
[1:06:35] desired that our expectation would be
[1:06:38] upon the word upon the Lord and from the
[1:06:41] Lord because this is the only grounds
[1:06:43] where faith can rest
[1:06:47] and
[1:06:49] even in that part of an expectation
[1:06:52] there can be things and I will just say
[1:06:54] it like this that we grow and we learn
[1:06:57] as we walk and as we walk and we mature
[1:07:00] in the Lord it should be the math
[1:07:02] flexion of my maturity is the less that
[1:07:05] we trust ourselves and the more that we
[1:07:07] trust him that's maturity maturity isn't
[1:07:11] I've got this on I can handle this and I
[1:07:13] know what to do here I know what to do
[1:07:15] here that's not maturity that's still
[1:07:17] showing there Steel's growth that's
[1:07:20] going on back here and we're always
[1:07:22] growing but you realize when it comes to
[1:07:24] a place of where you're at now as you
[1:07:26] mature you recognize I need him I can do
[1:07:30] nothing without him
[1:07:32] that's part of maturity it's depending
[1:07:35] on him
[1:07:37] hallelujah this is what Genesis 22 my
[1:07:40] Moriah points us to Abraham went up
[1:07:43] there by the word of the Lord he's
[1:07:44] depending on that word that God has
[1:07:46] given and as matured in his heart and
[1:07:49] his life has been matured by it he's
[1:07:51] depending on God to fulfill that word
[1:07:53] that's the same way that it is with the
[1:07:55] promise of the rapture it's not us
[1:07:58] becoming more dependent and out here
[1:08:00] it's depending more on God
[1:08:06] our expectation is to be built upon the
[1:08:11] Lord and
[1:08:13] this is where the Word of God
[1:08:17] was so this what will read it shows it
[1:08:21] so quicken to Hezekiah for the present
[1:08:23] situation
[1:08:25] how many know he's a present god I
[1:08:29] mean oh he's the I am
[1:08:33] he letting moses know when you go down
[1:08:35] there but first before you go i want you
[1:08:38] to know i'm the i am
[1:08:39] i'm the present god
[1:08:42] when a when one a person meets god they
[1:08:46] recognize he's present he's not a
[1:08:49] historical being he's not a future
[1:08:50] happening this is present and now you're
[1:08:54] walking in the presence of the living
[1:08:57] god who is ever present it stabilizes
[1:09:01] our life look now Hezekiah his approach
[1:09:04] in verse six this is part of even the
[1:09:06] building up he sets captains of war over
[1:09:08] the people gathered them together in the
[1:09:10] street of the gate of the city and spake
[1:09:13] comfortably to them saying aren't you
[1:09:17] glad the word speaks comfortably
[1:09:20] be strong and courageous be not afraid
[1:09:25] nor dismayed for the king of Syria he's
[1:09:29] quoting what God spoke a few times in
[1:09:32] Deuteronomy and what God spoke
[1:09:34] personally to Joshua but you see he said
[1:09:37] believer this word he's not reading it
[1:09:40] as just something that is history a part
[1:09:42] of heritage he recognizes what God did
[1:09:45] before he's the same God today
[1:09:49] and Hezekiah in fellowship with God he
[1:09:52] was not searching for scriptures he was
[1:09:55] not searching for this he had the God
[1:09:57] who was the answer to the situation
[1:10:00] right there with him and God illuminates
[1:10:03] this word and it is the Lord that first
[1:10:06] of all has spoke comfortably to Hezekiah
[1:10:09] and now Hezekiah is speaking comfortably
[1:10:13] to the people
[1:10:15] it's knowing you see that's why this
[1:10:18] message it's not something that gets
[1:10:20] left on tapes and books it's not
[1:10:23] something that we were memorize or this
[1:10:25] quo or this scripture rather we needed
[1:10:28] we need to know the app patient in the
[1:10:31] hour we're living in
[1:10:34] we need divine application this is token
[1:10:38] hour oh
[1:10:40] my be strong and courageous be not
[1:10:44] afraid nor dismayed for the king of
[1:10:46] Assyria nor for all the multitude that
[1:10:49] is with him for there be more with us
[1:10:53] than with him I
[1:10:55] know his problem
[1:10:58] he's been in that message
[1:11:00] and he ain't just been in that message
[1:11:03] of of Elijah and Elijah and Isaiah he's
[1:11:07] been in that he knows God is present no
[1:11:10] doubt it's like I Elijah he doesn't see
[1:11:12] the angels that are there but he knows
[1:11:14] that God is present and where he is the
[1:11:16] Lord of Hosts is
[1:11:21] glory be to God with him is an arm of
[1:11:25] flesh but with us is the Lord our God to
[1:11:29] help us and to fight our battles and the
[1:11:33] people rested themselves upon the words
[1:11:37] of Hezekiah king of Judah he wasn't a
[1:11:42] prophet he wasn't a priest
[1:11:45] but he was the king of Judah do you
[1:11:48] realize how God will speak of kings in
[1:11:50] the Book of Jeremiah he will call Kings
[1:11:52] my shepherds he will call him my pastors
[1:11:55] those in whom that God would be
[1:11:58] entrusted to lead his people in the
[1:12:00] midst of a situation now Hezekiah these
[1:12:03] are not his words as far as something
[1:12:05] he's come up with or maja let me see
[1:12:07] what how I cannot apply this right here
[1:12:09] because remember we've got to have an
[1:12:10] expectation from the Lord is that right
[1:12:13] a person might you know they could take
[1:12:16] the word and say well you know by His
[1:12:17] stripes I'm healed and here they go
[1:12:19] they'll take that word that promise is
[1:12:21] true it's genuine but they can take it
[1:12:23] with an expectation that I'm not gonna
[1:12:26] have to go through the surgery God's not
[1:12:27] gonna I'm not gonna have to take any
[1:12:29] medicine I'm not gonna have to do any of
[1:12:30] that God never gave you that expectation
[1:12:32] you created it
[1:12:34] well I've got a promise of God that is
[1:12:36] true but you can't dictate the pathway
[1:12:39] of how God's going to fulfill it
[1:12:43] youyou we're going in our own
[1:12:45] expectations we will be ashamed but
[1:12:47] never be ashamed of him oh come on now
[1:12:50] all the frost this assembly there's many
[1:12:52] of us has been ashamed but we never been
[1:12:54] ashamed in him we've been ashamed
[1:12:56] because our own expectations of certain
[1:12:58] pathways and this didn't happen this way
[1:13:00] and I was thinking it this way but all
[1:13:02] thanks Peter Claud but there is a sure
[1:13:05] foundation I tried stone in the midst of
[1:13:09] our life it holds us brother our life is
[1:13:12] built upon him and if we can look to the
[1:13:16] Lord he'll help us through our failures
[1:13:18] through those Saints he will mold us and
[1:13:21] mature us
[1:13:24] another new you now God tells you that
[1:13:26] personally and that's the way it's going
[1:13:28] to go then you know what you stand on
[1:13:30] that word so the people rested
[1:13:33] themselves upon the words of Hezekiah
[1:13:37] king of Judah now I want you to watch
[1:13:39] this here in verse nine of the same
[1:13:42] chapter after this did Sennacherib king
[1:13:45] of Assyria send his servants to
[1:13:47] Jerusalem but he himself lay siege
[1:13:49] against lakish and all his power with
[1:13:52] him unto Hezekiah king of Judah and unto
[1:13:55] all Judah that were at Jerusalem saying
[1:13:57] thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria
[1:14:01] whereon do you trust that ye abide in
[1:14:06] the siege of Jerusalem
[1:14:08] in other words who do you think you are
[1:14:12] now remember this is not Sennacherib he
[1:14:16] sent his messengers
[1:14:19] Satan has messengers to Paul called and
[1:14:23] false apostles deceitful workers
[1:14:26] is that right they want to take away
[1:14:29] from the real grace of God Satan's
[1:14:31] messengers also they bring sickness
[1:14:34] disease worry frustration
[1:14:37] that's what his messengers do his
[1:14:40] messengers carry a message remember with
[1:14:43] word come spirit
[1:14:45] you see the words that you're receiving
[1:14:48] it's not just well you know these are
[1:14:50] just words that that are out here no
[1:14:52] words carry spirits spirits travel by
[1:14:55] the word when Jesus would even speak and
[1:14:59] they were casting out Devils it would
[1:15:01] address that devil whether it would say
[1:15:04] peace or come out of them but you see
[1:15:06] the Spirit of God would travel behind
[1:15:09] that word it's the same way when there
[1:15:11] is words that's going forward there is
[1:15:13] spirits that travel with words
[1:15:19] this is why people end up in the messes
[1:15:22] they end up with they're watching the
[1:15:24] movies listen to the things are
[1:15:25] listening to and they wonder why they
[1:15:27] battle the situation's they battle you
[1:15:29] want to know why demons travel
[1:15:32] demons travel through mediums demons
[1:15:35] travel through words demons travel
[1:15:37] through plots and books demons travel
[1:15:40] through words oh ma but that's only a
[1:15:42] copycat because Almighty God he travels
[1:15:46] right through his word to brother when
[1:15:49] you can begin to receive the word let me
[1:15:51] just say it you might be in the most
[1:15:53] perplexed time that you've been here but
[1:15:56] when you can begin to receive that word
[1:15:58] and allow your heart to become aligned
[1:16:01] with it the Spirit of Almighty God will
[1:16:04] travel right with that word and begin to
[1:16:06] minister comfort to your heart it'll
[1:16:09] begin to minister faith and love an
[1:16:12] ability that's the power of the Holy
[1:16:15] Ghost coming through the word
[1:16:20] so many times they wonder why are people
[1:16:22] in the chaotic state they're in why are
[1:16:25] young people this way and why is this
[1:16:26] going on look at where we're at look at
[1:16:29] what they're feeding on
[1:16:32] come on friends once you feed upon and
[1:16:36] digest you will actually mold your
[1:16:38] character and your being and your
[1:16:41] association your expression but I'll
[1:16:43] think about it if that's true on the on
[1:16:46] the negative side how much more on the
[1:16:48] positive side I want to be a feeder on
[1:16:50] the word of God I want to be a feeder
[1:16:52] upon the holy ghost I want that of the
[1:16:55] Spirit of God to be the main diet when
[1:16:57] somebody comes in our home they come
[1:16:59] into our life I won't want it to be no
[1:17:01] mistake of what the main diet is and
[1:17:03] brother the main guide itself yeah it's
[1:17:06] organic I agree the main diet on let's
[1:17:08] run for my spiritual it is a rightful
[1:17:11] diet it's packed full of vitamins and
[1:17:14] nutrients it has just exactly what we
[1:17:16] have need of for this hour and
[1:17:22] watch how Satan's plan is
[1:17:26] this has all been done they this
[1:17:29] build-up now here comes the messengers
[1:17:33] think of what's happened Hezekiah
[1:17:35] already spoken
[1:17:37] he's spoken now the scripture says
[1:17:40] Sennacherib king of Assyria this is what
[1:17:43] he said we're on do you trust that she
[1:17:46] abide in the siege of Jerusalem death
[1:17:49] not Hezekiah persuade you to give over
[1:17:52] yourselves to die by famine and by
[1:17:55] thirst he never persuaded them to die by
[1:17:58] famine and thirst see how the enemy
[1:18:00] slipping this in he's trying to weaken
[1:18:04] what they're trusting in
[1:18:08] the Lord our God shall deliver us out of
[1:18:11] the hand of the king of Assyria half not
[1:18:14] the same Hezekiah taken away his high
[1:18:16] places his altars and commanded Judah
[1:18:19] and Jerusalem saying he shall worship
[1:18:20] before one altar and burn incense upon
[1:18:23] it see Satan knows
[1:18:25] say knows all of this was being done
[1:18:29] now it's come to test it but what he's
[1:18:32] testing is he's going to see where does
[1:18:35] the confidence of the people rest
[1:18:38] where is their confidence resting you
[1:18:41] know what there's one thing for us to
[1:18:43] say all I have complete confidence in
[1:18:45] the Lord but what happens when tragedy
[1:18:47] strikes I have complete confidence in
[1:18:49] the message about what happens when
[1:18:51] situations arise that you don't have
[1:18:53] answers for
[1:18:55] you see how Satan comes to want he's sly
[1:18:59] brother and sister that's not glorifying
[1:19:01] him remember our mind our own me you
[1:19:04] know I don't care how much we know the
[1:19:06] message how much we know the scriptures
[1:19:08] you'll never be able to catch him on
[1:19:11] that alone we need the discernment of
[1:19:14] the Holy Ghost
[1:19:17] not something from the past we need a
[1:19:20] present God
[1:19:21] let the little boy in the fender stroll
[1:19:24] he said I know mama I know we're
[1:19:27] Christians but in an hour like this I
[1:19:29] need a God with skin on
[1:19:34] no you're not what I and my fathers have
[1:19:37] done unto all the peoples of other lands
[1:19:40] were the gods of the nations of these
[1:19:43] lands anyways able to deliver the lands
[1:19:48] out of my hand who was there among all
[1:19:51] the gods of these nations that my
[1:19:53] father's utterly destroyed that could
[1:19:55] deliver his people out of my hand that
[1:19:57] your God should be able to deliver you
[1:20:01] out of my hand
[1:20:04] who do you think you are
[1:20:07] we have defeated many gods
[1:20:13] and you are told to worship one God
[1:20:18] we have defeated many and you think your
[1:20:23] God will be able to deliver you out of
[1:20:28] our hands
[1:20:32] into something how god knows just how to
[1:20:35] be quiet and just stay there and just
[1:20:37] say
[1:20:41] keep coming
[1:20:45] now that keep coming it might encroach
[1:20:47] on your body
[1:20:49] are you with me it might encroach on
[1:20:52] your mind in your spirit it might
[1:20:55] encroach on your home on a certain way
[1:20:56] but know that God's watching it on
[1:21:02] you see it's a kind mr standing on the
[1:21:05] Word of God
[1:21:07] God is watching all this come to pass
[1:21:09] now watch verse 15 now therefore let not
[1:21:13] Hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on
[1:21:17] this manner neither yet believe him for
[1:21:20] no god of any nation or Kingdom was able
[1:21:23] to deliver his people out of my hand and
[1:21:26] out of the hand of my father's how much
[1:21:28] less shall your God deliver you out of
[1:21:31] my head
[1:21:32] oh
[1:21:34] you ain't picking a fight with Hezekiah
[1:21:36] you picking a fight with God
[1:21:39] [Laughter]
[1:21:41] [Applause]
[1:21:46] picking a fight with one you know you
[1:21:48] gonna whoop I'm close to it
[1:21:52] he's calling God into question
[1:21:56] this is my prayer I
[1:21:59] pray this is your prayers where and they
[1:22:03] are lives be so yielded to him so
[1:22:06] consecrated that God could step down
[1:22:08] through our lives and say I'll answer
[1:22:11] that
[1:22:14] is that what you want my life to be in
[1:22:18] so in in harmony in tune with him the
[1:22:21] things that God would show Sam to build
[1:22:23] this up here get this up get this
[1:22:25] straight now take care of this and this
[1:22:27] and and yielding to him I wanted to be
[1:22:29] in a place remember when that mania came
[1:22:32] on the platform there and challenging
[1:22:35] the Spirit of God the Prophet had
[1:22:37] certain thoughts at that time he said ah
[1:22:40] sighs deem up
[1:22:43] it shows even in the midst of battle we
[1:22:46] still walk with our humanity
[1:22:48] the first resort is for us to resort in
[1:22:52] times of battle and strength with
[1:22:53] humanity
[1:22:57] but God showed us as the Prophet would
[1:23:00] stand there and say but I chose to think
[1:23:03] different faults about that man that
[1:23:06] poor man he's a husband he's a father
[1:23:13] remind you that man had already done
[1:23:17] some damage on policemen before he came
[1:23:19] in the building
[1:23:21] they asked brother Branham the policemen
[1:23:24] were coming should we take him away he
[1:23:26] said no
[1:23:27] let him alone this is not a flesh and
[1:23:31] blood affair Oh
[1:23:34] may God help us
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:41] the Holy Spirit
[1:23:43] accepted that challenge but here was the
[1:23:46] part that within it he chose to think
[1:23:50] different thoughts
[1:23:52] that's God's grace
[1:23:56] that's God's grace
[1:24:01] and his servants speak more against the
[1:24:05] Lord God and against the servant
[1:24:07] Hezekiah he wrote also letters to rail
[1:24:11] on the Lord God of Israel to speak
[1:24:13] against him saying as the gods of the
[1:24:15] nations of other lands have not
[1:24:16] delivered their people out of my hand so
[1:24:18] shall not the god of Hezekiah deliver
[1:24:20] his people out of my hand then they
[1:24:23] crowd with a cried with a loud voice
[1:24:27] in the Jews speech
[1:24:30] unto the people of Jerusalem that were
[1:24:33] on the wall
[1:24:35] these were Syrians
[1:24:38] they were speaking in a Syrian tongue
[1:24:43] but they knew they're not going to move
[1:24:46] Hezekiah but if we can bring division in
[1:24:49] the ranks we've got if we can split and
[1:24:54] bring division we've got him conquered
[1:24:57] if there is some way that fear can set
[1:25:01] in to the people how does fear come when
[1:25:03] you let go of what is sure
[1:25:07] when you forsake what is sure what is
[1:25:10] tried what is steadfast
[1:25:15] they did this to a frighten them and to
[1:25:17] trouble them that they might take the
[1:25:20] city I
[1:25:21] know I don't have to say this but you
[1:25:24] already know and it's true you know the
[1:25:26] devil will try to use the word against
[1:25:27] you to try to frighten you
[1:25:30] he'll bring up your mistakes and bring
[1:25:32] up your failures he'll bring up all
[1:25:34] those things right when you're in the
[1:25:35] midst of facing a battle facing a
[1:25:39] situation Satan doesn't care he doesn't
[1:25:42] care for right in the midst of a service
[1:25:43] he doesn't care where it's at he will
[1:25:45] try to do what he can't remember he will
[1:25:48] take the very message that is so dear to
[1:25:51] our heart our language
[1:25:53] and if you allow him you'll try to use
[1:25:56] it on you
[1:25:57] but remember God never comes with
[1:26:00] condemnation if we need correction he
[1:26:03] corrects us
[1:26:04] is that right but notice they came with
[1:26:08] that and says the Bible they spake
[1:26:10] against the God of Jerusalem as against
[1:26:13] the gods of the people of the earth
[1:26:15] which were the work of the hands of man
[1:26:18] they were attacking with voices of
[1:26:22] reasoning and doubt
[1:26:30] let me just say this to you without
[1:26:31] dwelling on it there are voices all
[1:26:36] around us
[1:26:46] there's only one voice
[1:26:48] that's true
[1:26:50] one and that's the voice of God
[1:26:59] I said there's only one
[1:27:03] so many voices in the world you hear the
[1:27:06] Prophet say so many voices
[1:27:09] but there's only one voice that's true
[1:27:14] examine what voices you listen to
[1:27:17] examine what it's leading you to do
[1:27:19] what's the leading you to do and you'll
[1:27:24] know whether you're listening to it or
[1:27:26] not
[1:27:30] God has sent his voice in this hour
[1:27:34] we are to esteem the Word of God above
[1:27:37] everything else
[1:27:41] these people were attacking the rock
[1:27:43] this is what this is what these
[1:27:45] messengers were doing they were wanting
[1:27:47] to get a place to find out a place in
[1:27:49] the people's heart they were attacking
[1:27:50] the rock the cornerstone that the people
[1:27:54] of God were trusting on
[1:27:58] let me just just move on for time here
[1:28:09] Bremen say it like this and in in the
[1:28:11] church age book he said
[1:28:14] Satan
[1:28:17] because he knows he cannot overcome the
[1:28:20] Holy Ghost he will attack the vessel
[1:28:23] that the Holy Ghost is using to try to
[1:28:27] destroy confidence you seeing Cain rose
[1:28:30] up to slay Abel you see the pattern on
[1:28:34] down and that's the same way
[1:28:38] when we look at this here brother Brown
[1:28:40] brings up brother Brown brings up an
[1:28:43] example
[1:28:45] he's gone out to preach a meeting and
[1:28:48] there's a woman that has traveled from
[1:28:50] Jeffersonville and went to this meeting
[1:28:52] where he's preaching and here he is he's
[1:28:55] you know divine healings being preached
[1:28:59] here the Word of God is going forth and
[1:29:02] here there's another woman in the city
[1:29:05] they gone to it she's just there all boy
[1:29:08] what God is doing just so wonderful her
[1:29:10] faith is being built up and the woman
[1:29:12] that was from Jeffersonville leaned over
[1:29:14] and said you ought to see him every time
[1:29:18] his children gets sick he rushes him to
[1:29:20] the doctor
[1:29:24] you know what that was about it was
[1:29:26] trying to break confidence in the word
[1:29:32] if that woman who spoken that way could
[1:29:35] only recognize
[1:29:37] that God is the healer no matter what
[1:29:41] Avenue
[1:29:42] it would give her rest
[1:29:47] but to her that was confusion
[1:29:51] how is he speaking this and hears this
[1:29:54] how did Paul speak this and Paul had
[1:29:56] Luke with him
[1:30:04] God permits that when are you saying God
[1:30:07] permits besiegement God permits trying
[1:30:12] the enemy wants to try to break
[1:30:15] confidence let me just say this very
[1:30:16] clearly don't underestimate Satan to try
[1:30:20] in any way you can to try to destroy
[1:30:22] your confidence in this message try to
[1:30:25] destroy your confidence in your pastor
[1:30:27] try to destroy your confidence in your
[1:30:29] husband try to destroy confidence and
[1:30:31] your wife
[1:30:33] preach brother sender
[1:30:36] Satan will it out if he can destroy
[1:30:39] confidence he's got you
[1:30:45] confidence does not mean that we
[1:30:48] understand everything
[1:30:50] confidence is we're trusting in the Lord
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:57] here's what the messenger sent let me
[1:31:00] just break into Isaiah that takes into
[1:31:02] this account
[1:31:03] here's what he says to the city and mine
[1:31:07] now come up without the Lord against
[1:31:09] this land to destroy it the Lord said
[1:31:11] unto me go up against this land and
[1:31:13] destroy
[1:31:15] listen to me now
[1:31:21] this is why you need to know where
[1:31:24] you're standing
[1:31:26] you need to know your god-given ground
[1:31:29] did God permit him to come God did
[1:31:32] permit him to come
[1:31:34] but when God permits something if he's
[1:31:37] going to manifest his glory
[1:31:41] he's going to manifest his glory above
[1:31:45] all the other gods
[1:31:50] watch this watch how this unfolds
[1:32:00] they just move on down here for sake of
[1:32:02] time
[1:32:03] in verse 18 of this same chapter
[1:32:07] here they say beware lest has the kind
[1:32:11] of persuade you say the Lord will
[1:32:15] deliver us and they go into the same
[1:32:17] spill about what about the rest of God's
[1:32:19] see all these other lands we've
[1:32:21] conquered in this God and this God in
[1:32:22] this God
[1:32:23] this is one of the most important things
[1:32:26] that they did when all this was being
[1:32:28] said and they were speaking to him in
[1:32:30] the language of the Jews they were
[1:32:31] trying to frighten the people in the
[1:32:33] wall here here is one of the greatest
[1:32:35] things that you can do verse 21 but they
[1:32:39] held their peace and
[1:32:42] answered him not a word
[1:32:48] we don't we know we're not clowning for
[1:32:51] the devil
[1:32:52] we don't know him no word
[1:32:58] you don't have anything to prove your
[1:33:01] life proves it
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:06] hallelujah answered him not a word for
[1:33:09] the Kings Commandments was answer him
[1:33:13] not
[1:33:14] and he knows there's times in casting
[1:33:17] your mouth where you have to stand and
[1:33:19] say get behind me Satan
[1:33:22] and then there's other times where the
[1:33:24] Prophet said don't stand there and
[1:33:26] rebuke that tantalizing rattlesnake walk
[1:33:29] on by it and ignore it
[1:33:34] is that right it's fighting that battle
[1:33:37] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:33:40] carnal but they're mighty through God to
[1:33:43] the pulling down of strongholds
[1:33:54] somebody's points I'm being very
[1:33:56] deliberate with just as God has put them
[1:33:57] my heart
[1:34:00] breaking confidence in the word of the
[1:34:04] Lord
[1:34:06] it's not where you say as a person oh
[1:34:10] no I don't believe oh I don't know about
[1:34:14] brother branham oh I don't know about
[1:34:16] the message oh I don't know about the
[1:34:18] Bible or I don't know about the Holy
[1:34:19] Spirit oh I don't that that's nice all
[1:34:21] together breaking confidence
[1:34:24] but if Satan can get you to look and
[1:34:28] focus on another means or another
[1:34:31] measure outside of God
[1:34:35] then where's your confidence
[1:34:40] it's not saying we don't take medicine
[1:34:41] that quote I just referred you to when
[1:34:44] they were making railing accusations
[1:34:45] against brother Branham the brown said
[1:34:47] medicines of God
[1:34:51] you see if it is where it where does our
[1:34:53] confidence
[1:34:55] where's our confidence within these
[1:34:57] measures whereas our confidence in this
[1:35:00] our
[1:35:01] what I'm preaching to you right now is
[1:35:04] an assembly these are not just showing
[1:35:06] up to minister to words or to those who
[1:35:08] are streaming this is a present our
[1:35:11] meets present application
[1:35:16] is they're not just Bible stories but we
[1:35:19] must be like that little of my
[1:35:21] woman that was down in Memphis Tennessee
[1:35:23] and the Prophet was led by the Spirit of
[1:35:26] God through the neighborhood and that
[1:35:29] she was standing and she said born in
[1:35:31] parson
[1:35:34] how'd you know I was a person she said
[1:35:37] God showed me you would be coming
[1:35:41] she had a need
[1:35:45] hallelujah
[1:35:48] she identified it you that Elijah and as
[1:35:52] that Shunammite woman rather that
[1:35:55] oneness sunday-school story there was a
[1:35:58] crisis in her home
[1:36:01] there was a crisis in her home and that
[1:36:05] word that she had read it became a
[1:36:09] stabilizer
[1:36:11] where she was looking
[1:36:15] preach with me somebody see one looking
[1:36:18] for the corner see one looking for the
[1:36:21] ambulance see one looking for the doctor
[1:36:24] persuade his life if God didn't come on
[1:36:28] the scene his life was over
[1:36:31] her trust was in the sure foundation
[1:36:36] [Applause]
[1:36:39] here came God on the scene
[1:36:46] what that was in the scripture she said
[1:36:48] that's who I am
[1:36:50] had been waiting on you to come God
[1:36:54] showed me you were coming and
[1:36:56] here's the thing by the brand got
[1:36:59] shorter he said he was coming she stood
[1:37:02] out there on the fence her back was wet
[1:37:05] with Dew on it
[1:37:07] the conditions around her the conditions
[1:37:11] of the night and the morning did not
[1:37:13] hinder her from an expectation
[1:37:22] may we have our eyes get your eyes off
[1:37:25] of the world I
[1:37:27] said in the name of Jesus Christ get
[1:37:29] your eyes off this world
[1:37:31] this world cannot bring harmony to your
[1:37:34] life
[1:37:35] it does not have the answer
[1:37:39] there's one the only one answer to this
[1:37:41] world and that's the coming of the Lord
[1:37:44] there's only one answer to your life and
[1:37:46] that's the coming of the Lord in your
[1:37:48] life
[1:37:51] there's only one answer and that's him
[1:38:05] our confidence must be in him
[1:38:14] I want you to watch this and second
[1:38:17] chronicles 32 20
[1:38:20] greatest thing that can be done
[1:38:23] and for this cause
[1:38:26] has a kind of the king and the prophet
[1:38:29] Isaiah the son of amos
[1:38:31] prayed and cried to heaven
[1:38:38] people say I'm tired of praying because
[1:38:41] you don't believe
[1:38:43] tired of praying I don't see no results
[1:38:47] you don't pray to change God's mind you
[1:38:50] pray that your mind might be changed and
[1:38:53] if you're making prayer book prayers you
[1:38:56] might want to just speak to him like you
[1:38:58] would speak to me or speak to somebody
[1:39:00] else and say God I need to speak to you
[1:39:03] I need to know Lord right now in this
[1:39:07] hour
[1:39:11] you know my prayer means nothing to
[1:39:13] people you know why prayer is not even
[1:39:15] when you tell people in the world let's
[1:39:17] pray you know it doesn't mean anything
[1:39:19] because they don't believe
[1:39:22] they don't believe
[1:39:24] they're not in contact with that Network
[1:39:31] how sad
[1:39:33] how sad because God has allowed it to be
[1:39:36] included in the Reader's Digest and
[1:39:38] everything else of the effects of Prayer
[1:39:40] he didn't even have to do that
[1:39:42] but you see we're living in a time where
[1:39:45] a generation has come up
[1:39:47] that know not God a
[1:39:50] generation that knew not Joseph
[1:39:54] you want to know how people can be
[1:39:56] disrespectful to Authority because they
[1:39:59] are missing the authority of God in
[1:40:01] their homes they're missing the absolute
[1:40:04] authority of Jesus Christ in the church
[1:40:06] that's how they can be disrespectful
[1:40:08] that's how they can be in that way
[1:40:10] they're missing the true absolute
[1:40:16] hallelujah
[1:40:19] glory be to God
[1:40:22] you cannot legislate morality
[1:40:29] you can't do that the Bible speaks in
[1:40:32] the hour that we're living in that that
[1:40:35] influence of that other Gentile power
[1:40:37] will think to change laws
[1:40:40] are you with me come on friends I'm
[1:40:43] talking Bible here I'm joking scripture
[1:40:46] to address present situations
[1:40:49] present need God has given us eyes in
[1:40:54] this hour
[1:40:57] this is the here's what after all they
[1:41:00] build up build up the walls build up
[1:41:02] Milo prepared the instruments of war did
[1:41:04] all this and now when it comes down to
[1:41:07] everything let's go before God in three
[1:41:14] it required spiritual discernment for
[1:41:17] the people to recognize this is not the
[1:41:20] King's words
[1:41:21] this is God's words
[1:41:24] the same discernment was needed to take
[1:41:28] the prayer that God moved upon Solomon
[1:41:31] to pray when conditions would come into
[1:41:34] the land think of the mercy of God when
[1:41:36] the temple of God is being set up a
[1:41:39] house that God ordained to be built
[1:41:41] David's son a type of Christ where we
[1:41:45] read here in the opening of our text a
[1:41:48] house that would be built a house that
[1:41:51] would be set up a house where he would
[1:41:53] be established in type speaking of where
[1:41:57] you and I are now
[1:42:01] and it took discernment listen to me it
[1:42:04] took discernment to know that this is
[1:42:07] the words of God
[1:42:14] they were not resting on Solomon as a
[1:42:16] man
[1:42:19] that could have been some troubled
[1:42:22] waters
[1:42:24] come on they were resting they had
[1:42:27] discernment to know this is the Word of
[1:42:28] God let me tell you a church I speak
[1:42:30] very plainly to you there in an hour
[1:42:33] we're in a time you must have
[1:42:36] discernment of the spirit and
[1:42:39] discernment of the Spirit comes by the
[1:42:41] Holy Ghost

[1:42:45] spirits

[1:42:50] spirits it's up there you've got to be
[1:42:52] able to discern the body of Jesus Christ
[1:42:54] you've got to be able to discern the
[1:42:56] working of the Holy Ghost and our myths
[1:42:59] to discern that takes you more and
[1:43:01] deeper than just the flesh of a man
[1:43:07] may God help you that you you don't even
[1:43:09] remember what kind of a tie i was
[1:43:11] wearing but you're so focused upon what
[1:43:14] god is saying
[1:43:15] that if i came here with a hole in my
[1:43:18] shirt or missed mats and everything else
[1:43:20] your focus would be so set upon what god
[1:43:24] is saying
[1:43:26] how a discernment in this hour to
[1:43:30] recognize it's got in my brother got in
[1:43:33] my sister it's God in His people

[1:43:41] eyes that kind of discernment and
[1:43:43] discern let God discern even in your
[1:43:45] life and you've discerned am I where I

[1:45:47] and if you allow it it'll stabilize you
[1:45:57] let's just be very honest for some
[1:45:59] people the best thing they could do is

[1:48:00] that healeth all thy diseases
[1:48:05] it was
[1:48:07] he's God over every situation
[1:48:15] knowing the plague of your own heart is
[1:48:18] to ensure as the scripture said if you
[1:48:21] say to this mountain be thou movin
[1:48:23] plucked up and cast into yonder sea and
[1:48:25] don't doubt in your heart it shall be
[1:48:29] even as you said like
[1:48:31] Hezekiah this is part of strengthening
[1:48:34] yourself
[1:48:35] God's not going to come down and go make
[1:48:38] something right with somebody else that
[1:48:39] he expects you to do
[1:48:42] hello somebody
[1:48:44] God equips us with these things that we
[1:48:49] would know what we're supposed to do
[1:48:51] is that right every man know what the
[1:48:54] plague of his own heart and
[1:48:56] committing that to God letting God
[1:48:59] reconcile our heart to him if there's
[1:49:02] any thing that stands in the way get it
[1:49:04] out of the way why that he might come
[1:49:06] down
[1:49:10] can I have just a little bit more
[1:49:15] we're nearing
[1:49:18] but I want you to see this here this
[1:49:20] prayer because this is important this
[1:49:22] isn't just as a scripture that has a
[1:49:25] kind Amos Isaiah they prayed and crying
[1:49:28] into heaven and once you watch this
[1:49:29] verse 37 here's the account Hezekiah
[1:49:32] goes into the house of the Lord he rents
[1:49:34] his clothes covered himself with sack
[1:49:36] cloth and he goes into the house of the
[1:49:38] Lord then in verse 2 he sends alack him
[1:49:41] who was over the household and Shemin of
[1:49:43] the scribe and the elders of the priests
[1:49:44] covered with sackcloth unto Isaiah the
[1:49:46] prophet the son of amos he's sending
[1:49:49] them with sackcloth humility
[1:49:53] go go to the prophet
[1:49:58] go to the prophet see all that's been
[1:50:01] done they knew what to do now it's time
[1:50:05] we need direction in this moment
[1:50:10] we've got the written word now we need
[1:50:13] the god of the word to come on to see
[1:50:16] they're coming the proper Channel look
[1:50:18] look they're coming not just a proper
[1:50:20] channel but in humility God will always
[1:50:24] recognize
[1:50:28] and they said unto Him thus saith as a
[1:50:32] kind this day is a day of trouble a
[1:50:35] rebuke of blasphemy for the children are
[1:50:39] come to the birth there's not strength
[1:50:42] to bring forth
[1:50:45] we've done all we can do
[1:50:48] we need God to come we need his strength
[1:50:51] to bring the birth
[1:50:53] when you've done all you can do you're
[1:50:56] repented you've been baptized in the
[1:50:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ then ask
[1:50:59] for God for his strength to come to
[1:51:02] bring the birth
[1:51:03] when you've done all you can do stand
[1:51:06] there on the word having done all to
[1:51:08] stand stand therefore with your loins
[1:51:10] Girt about with truth
[1:51:13] clubs the one to bring it to birth
[1:51:16] he's the one to bring it to pass we're
[1:51:19] standing on their way he brings it to
[1:51:22] pass look at this humility
[1:51:26] it maybe is it has the kindest words the
[1:51:30] Lord that God will hear the words of her
[1:51:32] ravishing whom the king of Assyria his
[1:51:35] master has sent to approach the Living
[1:51:37] God and will reprove the words which the
[1:51:39] Lord that God has heard wherefore
[1:51:42] lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
[1:51:45] is left look what he's saying he's
[1:51:47] speaking to the Prophet because of this
[1:51:49] God may hear our prayer lift up
[1:51:51] therefore prayer for the remnant
[1:51:56] what did Jesus tell Peter I prayed for
[1:51:58] you
[1:52:00] John 17 intercessory prayer
[1:52:04] how many times let me tell you something
[1:52:07] friends we under this world there has
[1:52:10] been a prayer that has been offered up
[1:52:13] for this generation
[1:52:16] there's been a message that has gone
[1:52:18] forth for this generation
[1:52:24] hallelujah Oh glory be to God I really
[1:52:27] feel like preaching now but I got to
[1:52:29] control it
[1:52:33] we have his word we have the Bible but
[1:52:38] we needed the God of the Bible to come
[1:52:40] on the scene
[1:52:43] hallelujah what good does it do having a
[1:52:46] map then you say well I know I gotta get
[1:52:49] there you gotta know where you're at
[1:52:52] it took one to show us where we're at
[1:52:55] and this is the pathway to get back home
[1:52:58] it's not enough to have the book that
[1:53:01] says this is home this is home but God
[1:53:04] sends down eyes that we might see how to
[1:53:08] get back home where we are and the
[1:53:11] Junction's along the way
[1:53:20] and how many times the Prophet would say
[1:53:23] I'm gonna pray a prayer and I want you
[1:53:25] to repeat the words after me
[1:53:29] God would move right behind the scene
[1:53:31] sometimes you hear the wind come right
[1:53:34] in the building
[1:53:41] Isaiah said to them does shock she's
[1:53:43] saying to your master this is what I
[1:53:45] want you to say to Hezekiah thus saith
[1:53:47] the Lord be not afraid of the words that
[1:53:49] thou has heard wherewith the servants of
[1:53:51] the king of Assyria have blasphemy
[1:53:54] behold I will send a blast upon him and
[1:53:58] he shall hear a rumour and return to his
[1:54:02] own land and I will cause him to fall by
[1:54:05] the sword in his own land
[1:54:11] so Hezekiah hears this praying
[1:54:14] he sends Isaiah Isaiah hears goes before
[1:54:19] God he sends back an answer to Hezekiah
[1:54:23] Hezekiah look what he does he takes this
[1:54:26] answer verse 14 he receives the letter
[1:54:28] from the hand of the messengers and he
[1:54:31] read it and Hezekiah went up unto the
[1:54:35] house of the Lord and spread it before
[1:54:37] the Lord you see what happened when he
[1:54:39] really read it
[1:54:42] he really read it and won just something
[1:54:45] on his phone he read it
[1:54:47] it wasn't just something he knew about
[1:54:50] he read it come on friends there's a lot
[1:54:53] of other things you can read it'll never
[1:54:55] do this for you
[1:54:56] it'll never encourage you to go to the
[1:54:59] house of God it'll never strengthen you
[1:55:01] it'll never bring joy in your myths by
[1:55:04] the sending you don't know what kind of
[1:55:05] a situation we're living it I sure do
[1:55:08] know what kind of a situation we're
[1:55:10] living in and I'll tell you the words of
[1:55:12] the Lord Jesus he said in the world you
[1:55:15] shall have tribulation but in me you
[1:55:18] shall have peace
[1:55:23] what good is your religion if you can't
[1:55:26] have joy in the midst of trouble
[1:55:28] what good is that if everything's going
[1:55:31] just right and that's when you've got
[1:55:33] joy I'm talking about a living God that
[1:55:36] when you're in the midst of despair you
[1:55:39] had the same kind of testimony that Paul
[1:55:41] said he said we are not forsaken
[1:55:46] cast down but were not destroyed
[1:55:52] this is what kind of a life this
[1:55:56] foundation produces
[1:55:59] this stone I lay in Zion
[1:56:04] and Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord saying
[1:56:07] O
[1:56:08] Lord of Hosts
[1:56:11] God of Israel
[1:56:13] if you need to pinch yourself pinch
[1:56:14] yourself say pay attention here

[2:00:04] [Applause]
[2:00:14] and they have cast their gods
[2:00:16] into the fire for they were no gods but

[2:00:22] therefore they have destroyed them
[2:00:25] now therefore O Lord our God save us
[2:00:29] from his hand that all the kings
[2:00:32] kingdoms of the earth may know that thou
[2:00:35] art the Lord even thou

[2:01:20] himself build up cut off water supply on
[2:01:23] and on this right here if he'd had done
[2:01:25] all the rest of it and they they didn't
[2:01:27] pray
[2:01:29] but his prayer he had an alignment of
[2:01:34] what to be praying for
[2:01:38] he had he knew there he goes to the
[2:01:41] prophet of God and he asked pray for the
[2:01:43] remnant a word comes back to him he
[2:01:46] takes the word goes back to the house of
[2:01:48] God with that word lays it out it says

[2:01:59] he didn't stop ray he kept praying
[2:02:04] I've asked you for more time and more
[2:02:07] time more time and more time
[2:02:12] but here is Hezekiah
[2:02:15] he prays I'm not gonna read this I'll
[2:02:18] just refer to this verse 21 comes back
[2:02:22] and remember he sent Isaiah Isaiah has
[2:02:26] prayed sent back a message now Hezekiah
[2:02:29] has prayed concerning that now he
[2:02:32] doesn't send a message to Isaiah but
[2:02:35] Isaiah sends a message to him
[2:02:37] thus saith the Lord God of Israel verse
[2:02:40] 21 where hast thou has prayed to me
[2:02:44] God heard his prayer
[2:02:48] God heard his prayer and then God
[2:02:51] unfolds the word that now is coming
[2:02:55] against Sennacherib he goes down through
[2:02:58] here within the scriptures and he goes
[2:03:00] in he says now notice in verse 27 let me
[2:03:03] skip to there here is God speaking
[2:03:05] therefore there inhabitance talking
[2:03:08] about the other lands were of small
[2:03:09] power they were dismayed and confounded
[2:03:14] they were as the grass of the field as
[2:03:17] the green herb as the grass on the
[2:03:19] housetop as the corn blasted before it
[2:03:22] be grown up but I know thy abode and by
[2:03:25] going out and by coming in and i rage
[2:03:27] against me this is God taking up the
[2:03:30] barrel
[2:03:32] you ain't talked against Celtic life you
[2:03:36] talked against me
[2:03:39] hallelujah
[2:03:41] when the enemy makes an approach on one
[2:03:44] of God's children he's got God on his
[2:03:47] hands
[2:03:51] let everything be set in the manner that
[2:03:53] God can step right down and answer his
[2:03:56] challenge o
[2:03:58] because thy rage against me and that
[2:04:01] torment it's come up into mine ears
[2:04:04] therefore I will put my hook in by nose
[2:04:06] and my bridle in thy lips and I will
[2:04:09] turn the back by the way which thou
[2:04:11] chemist
[2:04:13] and he speaks on here
[2:04:16] to Hezekiah but let me skip to verse 33
[2:04:21] therefore
[2:04:23] this saith the Lord concerning the king
[2:04:26] of Assyria he shall not come into this
[2:04:28] city nor shoot an arrow there nor come
[2:04:33] before it with shields nor cast a bank
[2:04:35] against it by the way that he came by
[2:04:38] the same shall he return and shall not
[2:04:41] come into this city saith the Lord for I
[2:04:45] will defend this city to save it for my
[2:04:49] own sake and for my servant David's sake
[2:04:53] then the angel of the Lord went forth
[2:04:57] and smoked in the camp of the Assyrians
[2:05:00] a hundred and four score and
[2:05:03] five-thousand and when they arose early
[2:05:05] in the morning behold they were all dead
[2:05:09] corpses
[2:05:18] everything that has a kind' them did
[2:05:20] they got themselves out of the way that
[2:05:22] he could step on
[2:05:25] the Lord help them to get them out of
[2:05:28] the way today could get off the scene
[2:05:31] that he could come on the scene
[2:05:35] they prepared those walls needed to be
[2:05:38] built up Milo needed to be built up this
[2:05:40] swords and the Spears needed to be
[2:05:43] sharpened all of that and praying notice
[2:05:46] they made their resource
[2:05:48] God in the midst of an
[2:05:52] unstable time
[2:05:57] God gave His Word to stabilize his
[2:06:01] people
[2:06:03] enemy is surrounded him words were
[2:06:07] coming at them
[2:06:10] things were being used their own speech
[2:06:12] was being used against him come on speak
[2:06:16] in the language of the Jews
[2:06:19] to do what try to frighten them and
[2:06:21] bring fear bring confusion because when
[2:06:25] you're fearful you're worried
[2:06:28] God can't work
[2:06:31] at the enemy can get you frustrated God
[2:06:34] can't move but if you can just rest in
[2:06:37] him and invites God to come and see
[2:06:41] and you find an omnipotent God
[2:06:46] working through an earthen vessel
[2:06:49] an earthen vessel the son and her
[2:06:52] daughter here is God working in his
[2:06:54] sovereign power and grace to stabilize
[2:06:58] in this situation I say if we ever
[2:07:02] needed him we need him
[2:07:10] they just say this to you if they had
[2:07:12] resorted to natural measures trying to
[2:07:15] out reason Sennacherib defeat him with
[2:07:18] words you would not read the rest of
[2:07:21] this
[2:07:22] but they made their resource prayer

[2:10:53] can take comfort to say Lord
[2:10:56] I've taken this problem in my hands
[2:11:00] I've given it back to you

[2:11:12] heart might be a plague of youth you
[2:11:14] resort to natural means
[2:11:17] I'm trying to quit
[2:11:19] but sometimes the plague even of our
[2:11:21] heart is sometimes we are so smart that
[2:11:24] we resort to reasoning instead of
[2:11:25] walking by faith
[2:11:32] live in that realm
[2:11:35] live where God can contact you and speak
[2:11:38] to you to lead you through
[2:11:40] trouble sometimes

[2:11:49] trouble

[2:20:06] back Lord and trying to whisper things
[2:20:09] and tried to speak in their language
[2:20:10] they define not only those laws they
[2:20:13] define the laws of gravity but they
