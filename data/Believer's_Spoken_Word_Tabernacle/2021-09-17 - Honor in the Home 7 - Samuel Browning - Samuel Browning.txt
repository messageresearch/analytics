just a testimony from brother drake regarding his stepfather he's asking you just wanted to thank the church thank you for praying for my stepfather dave he passed away peacefully monday morning from heart failure although we were praying for his physical healing it was more rewarding to witness his spiritual healing through god's mercy please pray for my mother's salvation so we want to just continue to remember the family in prayer also remember as he requested his mother's salvation as well and sometimes the things that you know outcomes that we are looking for and anytime we pray we should always expect for god to answer and fulfill according to his word and he always does healing always comes and if you remember back i think was about a year a year and a half ago and we we took that little thought with healing and the four anointings and how that healing sometimes healing will come and my just a miracle just drops right in there then there's other times where healing comes and it's through a process and then there's another time where healing comes and it's the ox anointing and that healing is not on this side but on the other side so in any way there's there's no into the promises of god they are every one of them sure and amen and so we just thank god for his mercy i want to just continue to keep them in prayer also i want to ask that you would just continue to keep the soriano family in prayer as well as the uh the church there in the philippines and i've talked with uh sister cynthia and obviously as you can understand it's just something that's very difficult uh everyone you know everywhere you go there's a new first and uh she's asking prayer because she said i you know just being able to go back to church and uh to see everything and there's just just so much around that just would remind her of brother rowell and so much labor has went in there and so we want to just continue to remember them in prayer during this time as well that god will just continue to give comfort to them and i think that's about it also remember the uh the dinner on this coming sunday we've uh went ahead and we cancelled that for this sunday which you already received the email announcement about that as well so award willing we do have one uh there's one plan that's at the end of october right at the very end of october so we have that this one right here we lord willing we will we'll reschedule it for a later time so also want you to keep in mind lord willing with brother homer longoria you'll be here with us a few weeks i think it's the second weekend of october so if you'll just keep him in prayer those meetings that we have coming up there i don't think there's anything else that i'm forgetting but if there is hopefully it comes back to me i use every everything at my disposal to try to remember but we just want to greet you in the name of the lord tonight so good to be in the house of god together and so let's just stand if we would and let's just go to him in a word of prayer i'd like to thank the musicians amen may god bless you tonight amen let's just go to him in a word of prayer heavenly father lord as we approach the lord in this moment of the service lord knowing that dear god within ourselves lord there is no sufficiency in ourselves lord father it would be foolish for us to trust in ourselves we find over and over lord how that you would mention in your word that even when israel many times lord there would be times that they would go to lord rely upon lord egypt and upon horses and chariots and we know that's the world and we know that dear god that we're called in this hour lord not to rely upon any lord of our natural senses or spiritual senses but we are to rely upon you father to rest and to trust in you lord truly as the scripture said that we walk not by sight lord and that's more than just these natural eyes it's everything that's around us lord but faith looks to the unseen it stabilizes us lord it strengthens us it guides us lord it's the answer lord for every question it's the solution for every problem lord and we thank you for that because we know that lord that that faith that's operating within our life that's not our faith but it's the faith of the son of god who loved us and gave himself for us lord it's your own life that moves within us oh god that pushes our faith lord we thank you lord and we just ask that lord that you would just lord have your way tonight continue to minister to each and every need lord father every unspoken prayer request every spoken prayer request lord jesus we just ask that you'll continue to minister lord to every need lord in every situation oh god father we just invite you tonight lord that you just come lord be the speaker here tonight lord come take control lord i pray in such a special way and every need that we have lord we presented lord before you tonight and lord regardless lord of the text we know as believers lord that god that there is a pool within our hearts lord and you are mindful of those needs lord before there was even a flea or a gnat before there was an atom or a molecule you knew lord that we'd be gathered here tonight lord and father you've already made provision lord jesus so lord we rest and we trust the lord tonight oh god and we invite you lord to just come and minister in a special way help me to step aside help the congregation lord father laying aside all the toils and the weariness of this day and of this life lord and just to enter in for these next few moments into your presence lord we just love you father we just love you so much lord we ask your blessing upon the word now in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you let's read in in the in the scriptures here in first corinthians 13. i had a little bit of a just getting the notes back there and and you certainly can appreciate everything that's kind of being juggled around and do you have it up now brother brian is it available for me to send that that's okay if it's not just pull up the scriptures it'll be all right first corinthians 13 4 you probably already knew we were going there charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly it seeketh not her own and is not easily provoked and thinketh no evil amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i'd like just to continue to just dealing with this thought that we've been looking at here for for some time on honor in the home and taking it from this part that love does not behave itself unseemly and you know over and over as you go through the messages and if you haven't i would invite you to go through the messages on divine love when love is projected and just going through those messages over and over i i just can't tell you i won't just say over the years but i can say that even from last year since when we started looking at some of this on discerning the love of god as they just continued to go over and just continue to listen and to glean and you find that where brother branham will say it over and over again because it's very true you said if god offered me every gift that he had or he says i'll give you my divine love brother brahm said i would take divine love over every gift because if you have divine love then you have what's needed to actually cause the gift to be effective brother branham would say like this he says without love the gift is not effective and so we recognize that a gift itself is to get ourselves out of the way and that's something that regardless if it's a five ministerial office or it's of the nine spiritual gifts it still comes down to every part of our life that daily in our lives to be able to get ourselves out of the way because we're recognizing that the greatest enemy that we have is our own self sometimes we look and say well so and so pushes my buttons but it's your buttons that they're pushing and one day to recognize that those buttons will be gone and those buttons sometimes all those parts that are there is an opportunity for god to manifest his overcoming power through our life you see when god has come in by way of the new birth that it changes our nature our life is our life has changed it's it's such a depth within our life where there is it's it's no it's not us trying to live a christian life but it's christ himself now living in our in the midst of our life brother bannon would put it like this he said it's christ in the very control center of your life and he speaks through your lips he thinks the types of thoughts that he would think through your mind and he acts through your temperament so god setting down in the midst of our life divine love and and i tell you what a great thing that we could have and to have the the love of god and to know that that's the greatest privilege that we can have as a mortal is to be born again of the spirit of almighty god this this is a love that you and i when we speak of it with that of the divine love of almighty god and we look at it and we we recognize that the love of god it makes no exceptions and makes no compromise and it won't do that within us either it doesn't mean that there won't be times that we don't think wrong about something or we might say something wrong but remember the bible tells us grieve not the spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption so it shows that there can be a grieving you know brother branham would put it so plain that the grieving itself doesn't even have to be anything that we would say he said you can even go to start thinking wrongly and the dove will take its flight and as a believer there is there is that part about our life that's to be very sensitive and it's what we delight in is to be in his presence it's to be under under the aroma of the rose of sharon to be anointed with the opium of the lily of the valley it's because within that it doesn't matter what situation we come in in contact with we have confidence in the anointing of god that's upon our life and so when we are seeing these things that are before us and how that love itself does not behave itself unseemly or act unbecomingly we're aware as believers that behavior matters and there are things that we can say well these things some things are just automatic it's automatic in one sense of the word but yet it's also given to you and i to know how to possess our vessel unto sanctification and honor it's also given to us to recognize that there's certain thoughts that can come in but to don't let it reign in your mortal body paul would go on to say give no place to the devil pull down strongholds showing that these things as far as in those outer realms for when a person has really truly been converted born again of the spirit of god the nature of sin is gone from that life on the inside and it is the very nature of god that is being expressed and comes out and even when you or i would be in the wrong or even when we see something it could be somebody else that's in the wrong we don't desire anything to be between us and another child of god or for that matter even anyone who is in the world because the desire is to reflect the lord jesus christ so when we look at this behavior remember brother branham would talk about behavior and how that you can have lives that when god can begin to deal with alive and it begins to speak to that life and the life you know here the heart begins to surrender it repents and it comes to the lord still has all you know of the uncleanness about it and remember brother brown will take this and the message is hear ye him and he'll speak about it in the hidden life and other places of how that the behavior matters and the conduct of our life because the objective is to get into that secret place with almighty god and you see there's a word now think about this the conduct and behavior there's a word that comes to you and i to correct us every son that cometh to god must must receive correction in his life it's a spirit of god that deals with our life and as we re as we yield to what paul called the spirit of grace then god releases to you and i the strength that we have need of and there's a cleansing that comes in our life with the ultimate objective is to come into that place of a union with god to where that it's no it's not the struggle but now it becomes under the influence of almighty god who's there to guide and direct our behavior to where our behavior we become known as a christian simply by the actions from our life so when we recognize this that when when when when paul would write of this it does not behave itself unseemly and as i said you know we can look at things and there's not one of us in here where there's things that you haven't had to come back maybe you said something wrong or maybe it wasn't necessarily you said something wrong but in your spirit you were troubled and how you spoke something then then the conviction of the holy spirit will come upon your life and said go make that right you see what is it it's the love of god that will not compromise you see the love of god is always there to help us to discern motives and objectives and so when we're when we when we see this we we realize that it's it's this love that is a love that you and i can never ascend to but rather it's the love of god that descended down to you and i and came to you and i and drew us to him that we might be united with him now i want to go into a scripture here if you'll turn with me to ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 7 and [Music] just turn with me to ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 7. let me just let me if you don't mind let me just send this here to to brother brian so he can have some of this right here to display for us i love technology love it when it works well when it doesn't how many appreciate what brother brian does here amen i really appreciate that he i know he runs around and he does a lot of he does a lot of things and we just appreciate everything that he does it certainly makes it it makes it really nice if ecclesiastes 9 verse 7. now i want you to know how many believe in this life that god intended in this life for you to enjoy the labors of your hands that's all the way through we're not going to take scripture after scripture on this but it's all the way through from the old testament into the new testament and sometimes sometimes the the thought line of is that well a christian is to walk around and this is a christian's life is a is a molly grub that's not a christian's life if you're walking around like that something's missing are you hearing me now listen to me don't walk don't don't say oh no oh i might as well go set in my car no just listen you have a promise as a believer not that things won't come your way but you've gotten a promise an advocate that you can go to the lord jesus and you can ask him restore unto me the joy of thy salvation david never lost it is that right now sometimes the joy can depart when you look in the book of joel joy departed because the people begin to neglect the things that was needed and they had no meat offering no drink offering to bring and to offer up to god you see god does not want you and i coming empty-handed i don't know where this is going god doesn't want us coming empty-handed it ought to be when we show up here to the house of god i know there's times how we need encouragement we need strength but we should be growing as a people and a body of believers that when we are coming together we are coming with the sacrifice of praise we are coming with a meat offering to offer up you know what a meat offering is it's where the grain has come to fruition you say brother samuel well when the grain comes to fruition that'll be a rapture you've got to keep the type in its appropriate place the bible says that in revelations 10 verse 8 that i say unto you you must prophesy again and the word again means a cycle of harvest where you are reaping and you sow back and you reap and you sow back you see there is a continual harvesting that's going on and a sowing back sometimes there's nothing to offer because there's nothing been sewn in is that right i mean you there there it's just like within a service you get into service what you put into it you get even in every part of our life what we put into it my goodness you're getting quiet already but that's good teaching i mean it'll stick to your ribs real tight because many times on you know we we come in we come to a service and we're on my you know the atmosphere here in the atmosphere here but you got to remember you've got to bring down what god is doing and bring it down into your life we cannot just look into the mirror and walk away and forget what we have seen in that mirror let me just tell you something every time that we come to the house of god we come and our shortcomings are exposed if we're really looking correctly but god don't do it in a condemning manner he wants us to grow and to mature and you say how do i grow and i mature we take a good look in the word it's the perfect law of liberty and then we go to god in prayer and if there's things we need to repent of and say god help me to pick this up lord in my life change this in my life don't be ashamed to go to him he ain't ashamed to come down and speak to you and let you know where you need to pick it up at and god is here to minister what we have need of and strengthen our life and make the correction in our life i don't believe in socialism but that was free ecclesiastes 9 7 go thy way look how this is rolled i love this this passage go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for god now accepteth thy work so how many know there's nothing like the peace of god you can have everything else in life but if you miss the peace of god you'll never be able to really enjoy the things of life the way you need to are you with me i tell you you've got the peace of god within your life in your heart it'll give you strength to face every adversity it'll give you strength you might have the worst job the boss can put you in the worst place but you've got a peace that passes all understanding my who cares if i'm not accepted anywhere else i'm accepted at home hallelujah for god now accepted thy works let that garments be always white amen unspotted from the world and let thy head lack no ointment oh my so always living and abiding under the anointing of the holy spirit keeping our garments from that of the world how many know your garments when we look at this in the scripture you know your garments when they would walk with the palestinian garments this is the thought remember as they would go along the roads there would be things that could be picked up along the robes but but let not your garments be spotted don't let it remain things sometimes you're around and things get picked up and and collected in our life that you're not even asking for of being collected this is why even when you come home and out of your workplace you need to take a good bath of sanctification and ask god cleanse me lord because there's spirits all around brother and sister spirits of criticism all types of filth and spirits that would like to attach itself to your life and bring anxiousness and everything else but you have a laver you have a privilege to go before almighty god is a priest of god and get a real washing and say lord i receive a washing and a strengthening in my life thanks be to god for the washing of water by the word ecclesiastes 9 9 notice this live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity which he hath given thee under the sun all the days of divinity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labor which thou takest under the sun verse 10 whatsoever thy hand find it to do do it with thy might how many remember where paul said whatever you do do it heartily as unto the lord is that right like brother brown when he told billy paul he said if you're going to be the best if you're going to be a bum be the best bum don't work a day in your life sleep in every day and everything else in other words don't do nothing half-heartedly give everything you've got let me just say it like now if you're going to serve god serve him with everything that's within you [Applause] because you've only got one moment one privilege one moment in time whatsoever thy hand find it to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whether thou goest so here in the scripture in verse 9 as it is expressing to enjoy that which god has given god has provided there's things that we have labored for with our hands but the laboring remember we recognize that it is god that has given to you and i whether it's skills talents or whatever more and we should never bury a talent in the earth we should always whatever god has given to you and i we should dedicate it to the glory of god brother brown said he'll god will use anything that is sanctified and dedicated to his purpose brother graham said you may not just be able to whistle but if it's dedicated and sanctified to the purpose of almighty god god will use it for his glory so notice here in in this in the scriptures we looked at where it clearly speaks that the wife herself it is a gift from god my that that perspective it changes a lot of things to recognize that the wife herself is a gift from god notice in proverbs 18 22 whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing now it didn't say whoever finds a woman there's many women but whosoever findeth a wife so this is different than just looking for a woman it's looking for a bride there's a choosing of a bride one that would have this attribute that would be reflected whoso findeth the wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor of the lord now thirsting for life brother rem would say it like this many times in many places he says it greatest thing god could give a man outside of salvation was a wife she was to comfort him to help him to bless him to console him and be a real companion to him now we read last time that we were together out of first corinthians 7 32 34 and i'm not going to read from there tonight but i want to refer to that you remember in the scripture where it speaks of those that were unmarried they you know they don't have any distraction or anyone else to care for they're able to attend unto the lord without any distraction there's no other care but whoever is married they themselves not only attending to the lord but must attend their to their spouse the bible says careth for how they might please them is that right now you see in reality when we look at this we recognize that how when the scripture states this there's always a right order in that of in that of pleasing brother brown called this order 1959 in 1963 he called it the order of overcoming and that is god is first your family is second and your last he said that's what jesus did he put himself last when he came here so that's the order of overcoming no matter what we face in life that is the order of overcoming so when god as we read here in the scripture the gift of god or that which findeth a wife that had obtained favor of god god will not give something to a man that would be would mean to replace uh the relationship or to hinder the relationship with him but rather in a real marriage it'll deepen the understanding even within the scripture and it's not necessarily the natural part of it but the spirit of god will work through that experience in our life to deepen that relationship and that care as it is between christ and his bride is that right it will it will deepen that i know you know even after uh my my daddy told me he said when suddenly says once you're married he said you'll find that there will be a deepening he said of the ministry he said there's things that you will begin to understand by experience you've read about you've preached but you will experience it even in a deeper way and there'll be more that even when you're ministering it by the understanding that god has given now i want you to think about this now you know understanding itself is not something we just get handed to us in a book but sometimes understanding comes through trial and error is that right i i know you know it's always kind of comical you know we always think you know how it is uh you know i think about let me just take it like this uh you know i tell you what with paul we were talking about this the other night i think it was you know paul being the firstborn i'll tell you boy he had to have a lot of grace with us he didn't know he had a lot of grace but he did because i tell you i mean we had we had men we had this guy even we had him so dressed up and we took him to the the doctor the first time the doctor said you're burning this boy up it's in july we didn't want him to catch a cold i mean there were so many things we were so tired about when benjamin came along we had now sat down in the lazy boy by the time that zachary came along we weren't just sitting in the lazy boy we already had it reclined and all the way back you know it's something about experiences you actually become more yielded and more resting and more at peace and there's things that you and i could never have known outside of experience there's a lot of things we can read about but you know there's one thing you can't read about and that is the sacrifice that goes with it and even at times when the feelings themselves are not maybe in that order but there's a desire within to fulfill that part and say lord help me in this area so understanding comes with experience you know it would be like me and for the aaron let me use you for an example it'd be like me just pulling you up and trying to say now brother aaron when you go out tomorrow and when you send them guys on the job here's what you really need to do buddy you need to just get them guys and you know tell them to replace that diamond blade you can tell by how i'm talking i don't know a thing of what i'm saying i've heard him talk a little bit about how he has to sign them guys and and you know they're so backed up right now as it is but you know what i have no business even saying nothing to him because i don't have a clue i've only heard him talk about it it'd be like me telling talking to you about siding i've only heard you talk about a little bit are you hearing me you see there's some things that we can hear say but brother when we're right in the midst of it that's when understanding comes let me tell you something god is the omniscient god he knows everything but brother he laid aside his splendor and came down and took up on the robes of earthly humanity that he might understand us oh my so understanding comes through humility through experience so now that same love it'll move and it'll guide see that same love of god that brought him down to earth it now moves in the depths of our lives to move and push our filial love because you don't get rid of filial love that's out there in those outer realms but the agape now sets down to push and move and direct and oversee that feeling of love you see because that feeling of love it's a love of self it is it's a love of self that we we we have to deal with this and battle with this every day well lord i say amen for everybody you know we're right and everybody's wrong i mean we were the only ones that got up on the right side of the bed i don't know what their problem is right offended well i'm not offended everybody else is offended loss is to lose sight of self brother that's one of the greatest victories is to receive that new birth on the inside to where you've completely come to a place of laying down that that that old man to deny the bible said deny oneself you can never take up the cross until you first deny yourself is that right so now the lord jesus has expressed it's daily taking up our cross daily and you see that that's even where it comes down when we're looking at the maturing even within our marriages and the marriage covenant is the losing sight of self to where it's not focused on fulfilling my needs or my wants or my this is it now the objective it becomes on the other person are you hearing me you know the very the very the very first thing well she did this or he did this that's the wrong things because why the scripture tells us we are to strive to accommodate ourselves to the interest of one another and we're talking about in the lord now are you hearing me this is where it's to be at it's not when you stop doing this and you stop doing that this isn't totally that's the wrong focus that that that that's not that's not even the root of the problem the root of the problem is somewhere along the line there's been misunderstanding come in love has gone away brother braham said it just like this when you fall out of divine love with god my if you can fall into divine love then evidently not that you lose it but you can fall out of it under the influence he said then you can't overlook your brother or sister's mistakes i know some of us don't have them but for those of us who have mistakes that was for us ecclesiastes 9 9 live joyfully notice this live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of thy vanity which he hath given thee under the sun all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labor which thou takest unto the son so this phrase live joyfully it means to enjoy to enjoy it's and to enjoy this the actual live live and joyfully these words are the very or the come from the very hebrew word where it's used first and and they had life from genesis 1 genesis 2 life it speaks of life life itself you know you can tell sometimes when you can look at a we had a tree out there even behind our house we've got an oak tree and then i got this other tree and we've seen this other tree and my wife pointed it out you know she looked at it she said you know i think that tree is dying and you see the leaves just starting to wither on is there's a big old tree and i looked and said i i don't know i'm hoping it's not dying and she's looking at it i think it's dying and sure enough it's dying now what was the evidence you start seeing the leaves the leaves themselves start folding in like this is that right you know how it is even with certain plants and things around your house you have to forgive me i can only pull as god brings it to me but different things that we would plant whether it's you know at times with uh we have planted hydrangeas and some of you know with that them nice pretty uh sometimes the white flowers and things that come out on the bushes but you know those things even when you first plant them they require a lot of care they'll get droopy if you don't water them and when they get droopy you know it's time to water them now you look at them and you think oh my goodness i've messed this plant up no all they need is water that's all they need and then you start finding out that now that has to come until they get established now i don't mean that i still don't have to water them it's just the watering itself the roots have grown deeper no wonder god would say even in the old testament when a man was first married not even to let him go out to battle but go and and rejoice and delight thyself with the wife of thy youth no wonder god would place that in the word not that it ever should grow old but there's a necessary part to establishing that and a continual watering thereafter is that right there were things that came up you know we had some we planted some trees last year and some of them trees as they came up you know you start looking at different things and i i never dealt with these trees before some of you probably know i'm talking about them arbor vita trees or whatever and uh you start looking at them and immediately you know you say oh my goodness you know here here is a brown here's a brown leaf come up on it or i don't know how you call it a leaf or whatever it is and it comes up on i said oh my goodness i said honey take a picture of that and and go ask them people what it is we need to put in there you know because you you if you pull it up on dr google there's everybody in there and their mother that's got some kind of opinion you know stand on your head and spit nickels on it or what and everybody has all kinds of stuff so you want to go and find out from somebody who really knows what they're talking about so you're not buying a bunch of penny and nickel stuff you everybody know i'm talking about so you want to go to these things and you and so she looked at it and come to find out there were certain things that during that time of the year it's a time to fertilize and there's certain fertilizer it needs to go in the ground you say what in the world does this have to do with ever with this at all well i'll tell you what it has to do with it there is things now that you don't have to ask me at a certain time of the year every so many months i go out there and i fertilize and throw in that holly tone and those things underneath them trees so that it will actually leach down into the ground and so it takes away that yellowness but you know what my i don't want to wait till that yellowness comes back i've already seen it one time so i want to make sure it has the right nutrients this is how it is even in marriages we do not want to wait till there's yellowness and other things come by but we want to take that once we find out this is the nutrients that's needed we want to sow those nutrients that's the same way in our spiritual life not wait until there's times of yellowness or dryness but we realize we need the refreshing and the renewing of the holy spirit the nutrients in our lives and he understands that and he's more than willing to provide for our life because he enjoys doing that so it's to enjoy this living joyfully to enjoy one another enjoy one another's company to find the joy the joy in serving you know paul would even write about how that that they were helpers of the joy among the believers in thessalonica the bible says in ephesians 5 21 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church so to think of how that through that union with with god and how that paul would write of this as god would bring it down to where that a man and woman brother brandon remember he ties it that those spirits that were made back there before the foundation of the world that when a man and a woman would come together here and they're united here upon this earth though you see two people but it's actually those spirits that are uniting together because you could look and say i don't see one flesh i see two people but it's actually the spirits that are uniting together that that male and that feminist spirit it's uniting together just like it did right back there in the garden of eden when god himself performed the first marriage ceremony so then the reality is is that for the man when he would look there at his wife and to regard her as his own flesh just as much as if you know i would be careful with my with my hand you know when you're pounding in nails i remember smashed your thumb you have the best of you have done that one huh and you do that and you know you don't say come on man get over it come on no most of the time ow oh depending on how hard it was you know oh why you you there there's a thumb and the thumb itself there's there's a trigger because there's been a hurt that has happened and it's part of your body and nobody had to send you a public service announcement to know your thumb's been hit right you didn't have no no thing go off on your phone at night a yellow car has driven away with you know you didn't have none of those alerts you failed it right i mean you're that one with your thumb you felt it and so what do you do like when you get a pain in your body what do you do when you get a pain in your body you try to find a way of comfort to relieve that pain right i mean whether you take tylenol or motrin or you say brother samuel i pray okay we pray and take tylenol and take motrin don't try to get spiritual on me so you understand what i'm saying so there's what are we doing we don't like feeling discomfort we don't like feeling that we try to do what we can ain't that right brother mark we try to do that so here paul is writing on their inspiration that that's exactly how god ministers to you and i aren't you glad how god will come right around and minister to our lives i so appreciate it this past weekend how god came in such a very personal and precise way and ministered to our needs just what we had need of to encourage us and the right things and discourage us in the wrong things you know what he's doing he's ministering to our needs as a body aren't you glad when you're down he'll come and he'll minister he's not something that you're way off he senses it the bible says he is moved touched by the feeling of our infirmities you know what that tells me he's a sensitive god [Applause] and he's attentive to our needs is that right oh my i tell you when we can look at that and you say brother samuel i can never live up to that when we're not expecting god's not expecting us to be god but if we can just say lord how you reflect yourself lord and show your love to me let me be that yielding lord god to let that my life be a reflection and a channel that can minister that inspiration right here as it is in heaven so let it be in earth hallelujah our body we you know we address it when it's in pain and everything else and you think of how that paul would write it that that nourisheth and cherisheth it and you know because this goes on to say even as the lord the church you see how god himself he never hated us he never ever hated us there are times that there's you know there's a difference between anger and hatred is that right the bible would say let not the sun go down on your wrath is that right let it not go down make it right clear it out is that right so when we look at this we recognize there are times that how many know that there are times that god he's had to correct us there's times that god his presence would pull back from our life it isn't that he desires to do that but his presence pulling back from our life is that you and i might be able to recognize wait a minute wait a minute something's wrong here his presence isn't here in my life the way it needs to be i tell you if a person can walk by in their life and they are absent of the presence of god and it don't matter to them that's a sad shape because the greatest company that we can ever have is the company of the holy ghost amen and to have the fellowship of the holy spirit in our life and and walking with us and speaking to us guiding us directing us and ministering to our needs so there there is the leadership of god of how that in our lives he comes and he ministers he ministers he nourishes he cherishes us now in colossians 3 18 let me just move to 319 for just um of the sake of scripture husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them now when all we read about all here in the scripture let me just say this to you paul is not writing this to a bunch of unbelievers he's not writing this to a bunch of make believers paul never said you know what i wouldn't have to touch none of this if you all just got the holy ghost preach brother samuel you see there's a balance when we talk about the automatic of the fruit of the holy spirit living out of our life but brother every day is a day of overcoming there's things you see in your life right now you didn't see last year but the spirit of god points it out why it's a jericho for waltz to come down it might be ai coming up it's a city that you have been commissioned to take it down because the baptism of the holy ghost is the land of overcoming is that right it's where overcomers are made manifest by the indwelling of the overcoming life glory whether it's sickness with trial whatever it might be notice husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them you know it's like like in this way of that of that bitterness of where i like how john gill john gill's an ancient uh you know commentary that how that he would write of this and look at it and just to pull that part out about bitter and he deals with how that it's not ruling with a rigor and tyrannical manner or behaving towards them in a you know in an ill-natured way or giving them bitter words or or denying them now notice what this happens instead not just not just doing the things that that would be wrong or displeasing now listen to me these are things it's evident when the spirit of god would move upon paul to write this he knows that in the marriage covenant and not so much to covenant but within a marriage that you have two people and there are two people that sometimes you're going to think differently sometimes you got two people i know this is news breaking news that have different temperaments different makeups sometimes they both the same way and they drive one another nuts but you understand there's things when we look at it here paul was writing knowing these things would be there by the spirit of almighty god you see what the holy ghost does through the word he puts things before you and i and and and in his word so that we might give ourselves to him and say yes lord this is what an overcoming life looks like how many know a picture is worth a thousand words is that right so you know a person can say oh i'm this i'm that a picture's worth a thousand words this is where the rubber meets the road paul was letting them know yeah in ephesians one chosen in class before the foundational world my they were shouting glory to god hallelujah i've been predestinated and he gets to ephesians 5 and they know now but i believe as believers they were looking at that and there's something in the heart that says lord mold me and shake me this is an area of my life i need to grow here i need to overcome it why there's an overcoming life within the inside but notice not just giving them you know bitter words or exchanges are or this or that or curt gestures or whatever but it can also be denying them their affection or their care or their provision or using them so we all fail and disappoint one another isn't that right brother branham when he talks about even voting in officers okay he talks about it in um total total deliverance faith is a victory super sense messages that are not even church order brother brandon will lay in a lot of the things with officers voting officers in and brother brown would make him make a mention like that he said now i want you to remember he said these these are your deacons and he said they will make mistakes but they're your deacons now we ain't just picking on the deacons pastor trustees anybody else just as much you know it's different when they're up here playing you say wrong note oh wrong note how many wrong notes have we hit oh lord help us see we fail and we disappoint one another is that right this is where this is where we misunderstand one another nobody likes to be misunderstood but yet we can frequently misunderstand is that right this is where brother branham would express it in this way in uh questions and answers part three he said understand talk to your wife now brother-in-law's talking about relations and things here as well i'm not going to go into the whole quote tonight if one nature is to you and another nature to her talk it with her talk it with her i don't think it said text it nope nope then say text to her sit across the living room or across the dining room table and text her you know texting has re replaced communication preach brother samuel i'm telling you you try to do the same thing to him sister understand one another and be a real christian gentleman and real christian ladies and brother and sister with one another always remember this is very important always remember you're god's children you're from a royal family you're a royal blood there's no better blood in the world than yours that's right a real royal blood shows itself that's what it is it's royal all that believe it say amen yes sir show what you are i'm a son of a king i'm the son of a king my wife's a daughter of the king how would i treat the king's daughter how should she treat the king's son see what i mean be real genuine so nourishes no man ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and carefully protects and cherishes it so just as much as the nourishment you know nourishment we all need nourishment in our bodies is that right i mean if you know how it is you don't get nourishment they don't call it hungry they call it hangry yeah it's about lunchtime you know what i mean you look and say ah that ain't damn they just they need something to eat there's sugar dropping or this what you need nourishment is that right sometimes you you go without eating you get a headache you know what i'm talking about what is it it's a part of your body that's letting you know hey you're without something you need nourishment is that right that's the same what paul is dealing with there is a need for nourishment now from the looks of us we don't have a lot of problems with that so we need in our own natural body but the nourishment of how that paul would deal with this of how that it would be that that that should be within that of a marriage a nourishing of that where there's a nourishing you know in reality if you can look at this in the right way it's actually the care of the husband that'll further bring forth the wife out of the woman hey who brought the mystery out of your life that you were part of the bride of jesus christ who brought that out not a church didn't do that rules didn't do that come on now you remember as a young person rules don't do that it takes our love affair a personal experience a contact with the lord jesus himself he's the one that brought that out of our life it's the water of life that came from that seed to come into this seed to bring the nourishment to bring it to life hallelujah that's why we couldn't fit into any other church why the mystery in our life was to be a part of the bride of jesus christ and only the bridegroom appearing himself can release that and draw it and bring it into a reality it's the same thing the complimentary nourishing between a husband and a wife you see to cherish something is to provide a tender care a warmth to it no wonder god would say in there in the beginning that that that that a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife be the warmth be that which which fosters that part to to keep it in a place that it's receptive it's very important i want you to think about this with abraham who was it when we look at abraham god provided the nourishment that was needed for abraham to grow i mean if you look back in chapter 12 you know abraham abram hard times hard times you you go down to egypt right right but then you find in genesis 13 got god allows situations to come up there's a separation a lot goes his way abraham sees the need for that and then here comes abram and god says rise up and i'll show you east west north south you understand it keeps on going but emperor abraham's growing the growth within abram was because of the nourishment that god was providing to him this is where this is why for you and i we are not a product of our own doing salvation is of the lord it is a product of his nourishment to our life he knows what you and i have need of he nourishes you and i because his desire is to see his own image being reflected in our life so he nourishes us with his word by his spirit is that right now i want you to understand this here don't misunderstand me when i say this but there's a maturing a growing into a becoming of a husband a wife father or mother than just an entrance into a marriage or receiving the blessing of children it requires continual nourishing and cherishing through the journey i think the example that the holy spirit had made he used before when we were talking about paul and our kids and things like that there's things that even now that you know to be able to understand as a husband and wife to understand one another better in in a better way to to to minister to one another there are there's a maturing that takes place within our life by the same are you saying maturing doesn't mean that we don't make mistakes i didn't say that are you saying maturing brother samuel it means that we don't disappoint one another i ain't saying that i'm talking about maturing itself is where that within our lives we recognize that within these things it's a nourishment that brings maturing you plant something or you have something out there that you know you put out in the garden or whatever more if you don't feed it and you don't water it and you don't put it in light it ain't gonna grow don't blame the plant are you with me and the other thing is there's certain plants you know azaleas and things like that there's certain plants that you grow you take hydrangeas you take different ones there's a certain ph in that soil every soil you might say man that all soil it's all dirt but there is a certain ph that must be present in order for that plant to provide its full potential and if the ph level is not right if it's too acidic you've got to bring it back to a neutral if it's too uh you know neutral and it needs more acidic like azaleas do you're gonna have to add that into the soil because that's what's needed in order to make it flourish you say how do you know that you've got to read the label come on now that's the same thing it is with those naturally god never meant for it to be it would be something of guests here and guests there you can know whether acid needs to be added or this needs to be added brother you you know there's things that you know your wife can tell you and you realize man this ain't hitting the mark whoo i mean you just think man this is this is bullseye it ain't bullseye so what do i do well you got to get a better gun no how about just go talk to the person who knows where the target's at and the bulls eyes at come on somebody brother samuel i'll go read a book save your time go go go talk to the professor hallelujah i mean you know otherwise you need to get somebody else's opinion for it let me try to let me try to come down here let me have just a few more moments so the great care within the within a marriage of how that even god would care and he nourishes our life even to where we're at right now god continues to provide the nourishment that's needed for right now just like when you hear you look at how that god will take in a service and how god will come and he'll certain things will be spoken and sometimes god will take a service and he'll deal with trials deal with tests and i mean how many times how many times have we heard messages on trials how many times have i preached messages on trials not only here but other places and you know god would but there's how how many times even in other other you know other needs and things that arise and so forth but god is ever mindful the bible says that the eyes of the lord run to and fro is that right so when we come to the house of god this is why sometimes it almost takes your breath away when you begin to realize he don't this man don't know me this is god because even though we know one another i'm talking about just being you even though we know one another but god knows the very thoughts of our heart you see god is so attentive to our needs to minister to what we have need of let me read just a few scriptures and then we'll we'll just close here how it refers in in deuteronomy uh chapter 11 i love these verses of scripture when it talks about the land and the watering you know in egypt they had to carry the water from one place to another they had to transport it but god let him know here if i can just jump straight to verse 12 but god let him know this is a land which the lord thy god careth for when you hear when you think of land what is land it's where seed sown right in the in the scripture where it says and god put the man whom he had formed into the garden the word garden means bride a land which the lord thy god careth for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year his eyes are always upon it he's the one caring for it he's attentive to the land aren't you glad he's attentive to your life aren't you glad he knows just exactly what you and i we have need of and not just knows it but he ministers to you and i you ministers to you and i and you know sometimes let me just say something let me tell you something about him that's so precious he knows sometimes even though he knows what we need and he'll come to minister to it but he knows sometimes we're not really in the right humor maybe to receive it this is not even here we're just going to go with this and we'll close he knows that we're not maybe in the right humor to receive it so it ain't going to do no good to just sow it if the ground's not available to receive it so he must work on that ground so that it comes into a place of reception it might be through the toils of life it might be through things that are going through heartaches disappointments even questions of why or or things that's come about hey look elisha was not in a good humor is that right prophet of god an ordained channel of god to receive divine inspiration that would address the circumstance but because he was angry the channel was not available are you with me but elisha oh i love this boy elisha was a mature son of god he didn't say high and angry i ain't oh you know it's you hit you it's you making me better no it's you it's your fault no no he was a mature son of god i'm angry we'll give me a minstrel put some gospel music on we got to change this atmosphere who needs to be changed i do i need to be changed see this is what mature sons and daughters of god do that can look in the word and the word can show our shortcomings show what we have need of and we're not trying to shove it off or pass the buck on somebody else we see that lord i need my atmosphere changed that's taking responsibility glory be to god he is attentive to what you and i have need of in first samuel i'm closing you remember hannah's husband elkin remember here and he had another had another wife well i had two of them i don't know but he had another one and she had she had a lot of sons but hannah didn't have any hannah was barren right that bothered her she wept because of it you know why her desire was not to be barren she wanted to bear alcana a son a child see that that's where that's where the delight was is to bear a child you realize right now i don't even know how we're getting on this but do you realize there's a um there's an article i may speak on this a little bit at one point but there's an article that just was was put out here a few weeks ago and i looked at it where you find the young generation that's coming on right now and i'm saying young i'm not talking about 18 years old i'm talking about 27 and on to 30 or whatever more where they're looking and they're already making plans we're not having children the scripture says it would come to that spot where they would say blessed are the paps that never gave suck and the wombs that never bear is that right that's end-time prophecy this is this is this is a an article that is right out there and they're interviewing the people and these individuals are you know what hey we don't want it we don't want to be bothered with it they're just right out on us with it they don't want to be bothered with it but you see it's within a woman a man and how that god will bring that about the fruit of their union think about hannah here this is what i want you to think about his attentiveness and that attentiveness of the husband elkanah sees what's going he sees and he's seeing this with anna with hannah sorry in verse 8. then elkanah her husband said to her hannah why weepest thou and why edith thou not and why is thy heart grief what is this he's attentive you see the cares of life let me just say this the cares of life life is life and do you know how it is there's sometimes where you just don't feel like you've got enough time in the day is that right hey listen moses dealt with that too it came time moses was so busy with what god had called him to do with the exodus that he forgot to circumcise his own boy is that right he forgot the very sign of the covenant you see things that we can become so busy with so i give that example as it comes to me it's not necessarily busy sometimes with the wrong things it's just simply that's busy this is why when brother you know when it comes down to let me just say like this it's always a litmus test if you don't have time to be in the house of god to read and to pray you're too busy we're too busy brother brown would tell us as ministers over and over the message influence voice of god in this last days over and over ministers don't ever get yourself too busy to where you can't get alone and hear god's voice now i don't believe that applies to ministers but i believe that applies to every one of us because satan's desires to get us so busy and the scripture talks about remember the seed being sown even in one place of it that even to where the cares of this life i understand we all understand there's times sometimes we go through weeks there's times there's seasons and things like that that things can you know go on whether it's here at the church or in your in your in in times in your job and things like that where you know things turn into from eight to 12 hour days to seem like around the clock on something you think my lord if we can just get out of this season and you know it's a season lord give me strength but you see this is why in the other seasons it's a time to store up are you with me it's a time to store up because there's going to be times in our life that we need that stored up in our life now that don't mean i want you to come in and say i'm going to come every day for church so i can you know be gone for a month no don't take it down don't take it that way you understand what i'm saying we have to we understand that that's a principle now notice this he says am not i better to thee than ten sons my now the other one was provoking or the other the other wife was provoking her he took knowledge he took notice of this was going on his attentiveness and he speaks to her am i not better than 10 sons now she's not going to say to him oh no you're terrible you're this no you know what it was his affection his care all of that to care for her but yet her desire was for a son and remember god had closed her womb for a certain time an appointed season god had an appointed seed to come but the attentiveness of this is close that attentiveness that was there let me tell you something i never forget i forget when brother brother monica kobias when he was ministering at the other we were renting renting that church and he was dealing with hezekiah and when hezekiah turned his wall his head to the wall and he began to repent it's oh god i need to set my house in order give me lord 15 more years that i can set it in order he realized the house was not in a position for him to pass so god gave him grace to set his house in order and never forget what brother monaco he stepped around he's standing up there by the altar how that was at the other church and he says god before any any tear could ever come out of here god already seen that welling up in the tear ducts back in his eye you know what you know what that speaks to me of god's attentiveness before we even would crowd before there's a moment of sorrow god already sees and he knows samuel then what should i do well i would just this is what i would do i would just look to him lord you know my need you know what i have need of now let me just share this with you brother braham said you find this over and over i said i was closing let's just let's stand i'll talk to you a few more moments but this is what i want you i want you to catch this here sometimes you look at situations and you and we can look at them and we say i don't know i don't see this or i don't see look god has not been speaking these things to overwhelm our lives or for us to walk out here and say oh i can't do this no this is god speaking to what lays within us what he has deposited of his own life and if he hasn't he's here to deposit it tonight and to receive that that this might be reflected he's not asked you and i or called us to do something that is impossible with us yes but not with him so we can give ourselves to him like brother brahm says over and over in the message desperation then uh just reading in another place in the message here brother brown says if you come here and you come up front and you say i don't know i tell you i tell you i just feel so terrible i feel so bad i don't know i've been prayed for so many times i just don't i don't know brother branstad you might as well go on home might as well go home in desperation well i don't know god wants to give me the holy ghost he'll give it to me he said just stay in your seat don't even come up why because everything is based on faith to believe him to believe what he has said in his word he will perform it he didn't ask you and how to figure out how how can this be how can that be but if remember a gift is to get ourselves out of the way if we can just say lord let me get myself out of the way that you can just come and fill up that empty part you know we might have to dig out a little bit dig this valley full of ditches we might have to dig dig dig dig dig but if we dig the rock is still in the land tonight the rock that can release that water right down through that channel he's still here what i have to do just dig out just dig out it ain't up to you to supply the water just dig out the water will come amen let's pray father lord you know each and every need you know every heart in every life lord our hearts are always challenged not just in these services but lord in each service we we see dear god it comes down to it lord where the rubber meets the road where these lord expressions through our lives now lord i pray that right here tonight as you see every need that's gathered here if there's one that don't know you in that real intimate and real personal way i pray right now god may it just be in their heart they make that determination the lord just lay aside everything of the world and say lord i want to be so united with you i want the holy ghost more than anything lord grant it lord and i pray father that as throughout this this assembly those are streaming lord i pray that god from a humility lord in our hearts to lord as a prostrate ourselves as we look into the perfect law of liberty we lord can take a reckoning can see within our lives we can see our shortcomings lord but we recognize the presence of god that is here to lord not only reveal our shortcomings but lord to release to us the divine grace that's needed lord that we might come into those places that you're calling us to you're attentive you're attentive to each of our needs there's no need that's too small nor is there a need that's too great for you lord granted i pray father in every home every marriage lord i pray for every home lord as it's gathered here tonight lord in the name of jesus christ that oh god that it would be within our hearts to be so set to say lord i want to see lord the full potential lord of what you have placed within my life lord i i want to continue to grow and mature not only as a believer as a son and daughter of god but as a husband as a wife lord god as a father as a mother i want to mature and grow in the grace and knowledge of the lord jesus christ grant it lord we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen let's just worship him for just a few moments go and lead us [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's the way it's got to be [Music] until there's a room [Music] from [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Applause]
