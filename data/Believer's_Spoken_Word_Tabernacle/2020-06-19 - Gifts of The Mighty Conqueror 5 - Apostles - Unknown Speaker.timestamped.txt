[19:03] was wearing a long
[19:10] and her leaves were

[34:03] take them before the Lord tonight
[34:06] Heavenly Father what a privilege and an
[34:10] honor it is Lord that we can call you
[34:12] our Father and to know that Lord it's
[34:17] not just words but that's a personal
[34:20] revelation
[34:21] we're your offspring Lord we've been
[34:25] changed
[34:26] we've been transformed by you you've
[34:31] touched our lives whoa God it's a
[34:35] paradox Lord that we can't explain but
[34:39] we know we're not the same
[34:42] Lord you're everything to us Oh God
[34:47] this word that you've sent to us Oh God
[34:51] just so illuminated our hearts Lord we
[34:56] just tonight as we come to your Lord we
[35:01] know we're living Lord in trouble
[35:04] sometimes you never you never said that
[35:08] would be easy as a matter of fact Lord
[35:10] how that I think Paul would even
[35:13] encourage the church and exhort them and
[35:17] tell them how that through much
[35:19] tribulation they inherit the kingdom of
[35:23] God
[35:24] you said Lord that in this world we'd
[35:28] have much tribulation but in you we have
[35:30] peace and that's the truth Lord this
[35:34] world it's fallen apart
[35:38] [Music]
[35:41] this framework oh god what's up on this
[35:46] earth but all father what a promise that
[35:50] we have that the meek shall inherit the
[35:53] earth how that the earth itself is
[35:57] groaning and travailing Oh God we're
[36:03] longing for deliverance and lord I pray
[36:08] tonight that you'd come you just speak
[36:13] to our hearts those that are new visible
[36:16] those are in the invisible audience God
[36:20] we ask that you'll minister to every
[36:22] heart into every need father you see
[36:26] those means behind it then uplift at
[36:28] hand the written request and the
[36:31] unwritten ones Lord and we asked your
[36:34] God that the same angel of the Lord that
[36:37] God you would go to your children
[36:39] tonight Lord minister to their needs
[36:42] Lord you know their address Lord you're
[36:45] the same age of the Lord that even after
[36:49] a meeting is over
[36:50] after the prayer has been pray you still
[36:53] come around through neighborhoods notice
[36:57] your prophet with jealousy said the age
[36:59] of the Lord he can't get to it all at
[37:00] once or sometimes you'll come around a
[37:04] day a week the time after that meeting
[37:07] but Lord it's a promise that we're
[37:09] holding to and we thank you O God before
[37:14] that deposit of faith in our hearts
[37:16] where we can just take your word and
[37:18] just rest on and say Papa said it he
[37:22] meant it to me there was nobody else he
[37:25] made sure that promise was placed in
[37:27] there for my need oh god how we thank
[37:31] you
[37:31] we know you to be that detailed that
[37:34] mindful
[37:36] we just asked now may your spirit just
[37:39] come just just bring it over us Lord
[37:41] take us the Lord I pray
[37:44] minister to our needs Lord tonight if
[37:47] there's one year that don't know you're
[37:49] in the invisible audience that would
[37:51] hear it Lord may their heart be so
[37:53] touched your God it'll have to be more
[37:56] than a man you know have to be you
[37:58] father but you know each and every one
[38:00] of your children Lord and you're not
[38:02] loser one so father we just ask that may
[38:06] you come help us Lord right now if there
[38:09] be anything Lord that we've said or done
[38:12] or fought in any way that would be out
[38:14] of line forgive us Lord
[38:16] we're standing in need of you Lord God
[38:19] we're here to serve we're here father to
[38:23] receive from you we heard of Lord give
[38:26] you worship Lord may you just come now
[38:31] father we pray in the name of the Lord
[38:35] Jesus Christ amen amen
[38:40] let's open our Bibles to mark chapter 16
[38:49] and we want to begin reading here
[38:54] familiar passage and scriptures to the
[38:58] church but these are still the general
[39:01] orders it's the last Commission to the
[39:05] church verse 14 afterward he appeared
[39:09] unto the eleven as they sat at meat and
[39:12] upbraided them with their unbelief and
[39:14] hardness of heart because they believed
[39:17] not them which had seen him after he was
[39:21] risen and he said unto them go ye into
[39:25] all the world and preach the gospel to
[39:28] every creature he that believeth and is
[39:32] baptized shall be saved but he that
[39:36] believeth not shall be damned and these
[39:40] signs shall follow them that believe in
[39:44] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[39:48] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[39:51] take up serpents and if they drink any
[39:54] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[39:57] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[40:01] shall recover so then after the Lord had
[40:04] spoken unto them he was received up into
[40:09] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[40:12] and they went forth and preached
[40:15] everywhere the Lord working with them
[40:18] and confirming the word with signs
[40:22] following amen may God bless you and
[40:27] bless the reading of the word as you're
[40:28] being seated I want to would like to by
[40:32] the help of the Lord to continue on with
[40:36] this are the gifts of the mighty
[40:37] Conqueror but I'd like to look at
[40:40] the that of the ministerial gift out of
[40:45] the apostles and begin to look at that
[40:47] here tonight because we know that
[40:50] brother Branham would make it very very
[40:53] clear to us and we'll see different
[40:55] things that as we go through it a lot of
[40:59] familiar ground but to recognize that in
[41:03] inside of Christ here the great diamond
[41:06] of God you find that here in his
[41:10] ministry you'll find that of an apostle
[41:12] you'll find that of a of a teacher
[41:15] you'll find that of the Prophet that was
[41:17] spoken you'll find that of even in the
[41:20] Ministry of the Lord Jesus there will be
[41:22] times that will come forth that are very
[41:24] pastoral and then there are times that
[41:26] are very evangelistic of an evangelist
[41:30] so all of them as brother Bramblett said
[41:32] in him was all of them and yet though
[41:35] all that were within him yet how that
[41:39] when this Great Commission is given we
[41:43] we do not read of in this in these words
[41:47] here of of the words here of pastors or
[41:51] evangelists or any of those words but
[41:53] all of that it comes down to God has a
[41:56] way of setting all of these things forth
[41:58] when they're needed God doesn't give
[42:01] anything until it's needed that's how it
[42:04] is even in our life sometimes we can get
[42:07] ahead in our thinking and our thought
[42:09] about something and wanting but remember
[42:11] God always prepares you for what he has
[42:14] for you at that time there's always
[42:17] things that are unfolded at that moment
[42:19] and that happens all the way through our
[42:21] natural life and all the way in through
[42:24] our spiritual life God is preparing us
[42:27] for what even that would be coming and
[42:29] what that he has called us to and I look
[42:33] at this in the scripture of how that
[42:35] they were they were set forth by the
[42:39] vindicated word that was now present in
[42:42] them there was no longer just them
[42:45] walking with Jesus but now that same
[42:49] word was vindicated personally inside of
[42:52] them
[42:53] not just to see him that he was raised
[42:55] from the dead but to know that with a
[42:58] living reality that so changed their
[43:02] lives and his life now living on the
[43:06] inside of them they it was a reality to
[43:10] them of who he was personally to them so
[43:15] what they were going forth with was a
[43:17] testimony of a personal experience and
[43:20] that's exactly I think of how you know
[43:23] brother Brandon would would would speak
[43:25] of how that a man who feel called to
[43:27] preach he said you know a person might
[43:29] look and say well I don't know what to
[43:31] say
[43:32] he said just say and tell somebody how
[43:34] your candle got lit because that's
[43:37] ultimately what it is it's it's the it's
[43:40] the experience of a living God and so
[43:44] when we look at this thing they came out
[43:46] in this time with a very boldness of the
[43:50] lion they had went into the upper room
[43:52] they were cowards but now they come out
[43:54] with a boldness of the line they've got
[43:57] a message that they're gonna proclaim a
[43:59] message that they're going to roar forth
[44:02] and so to think of it that this was to
[44:05] begin at Jerusalem Jesus said in John
[44:08] 20:21 he said to them peace be unto you
[44:13] and as my father hath sent me even so
[44:17] send I you
[44:19] and he speaks in Acts chapter 1 verse 8
[44:23] you shall receive power after the Holy
[44:27] Ghost is come upon you that that there
[44:30] are qualifications that go along with
[44:33] the ministry and I'm not going to focus
[44:35] upon those tonight but there is one
[44:38] thing that qualifies not only for the
[44:41] ministry but for every true believer and
[44:44] that is to be endued with power from on
[44:48] high
[44:49] because the Holy Ghost is not a separate
[44:52] person from God it's not a separate
[44:55] person from the Lord Jesus it is God the
[44:59] Lord of glory come down
[45:01] and take upon a body of flesh in order
[45:04] to bring you and I back to himself that
[45:08] we might receive the life that we were
[45:11] intended to have before the fall you see
[45:14] when we see this here in the scripture
[45:18] notice as he said and you shall be
[45:20] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[45:25] in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[45:29] uttermost parts of the of the earth now
[45:32] I want you to notice even if Jesus would
[45:34] would would express this here you see
[45:37] God don't leave anything unfinished he
[45:41] ain't like us start one project and we
[45:43] leave that project and go to another one
[45:45] and then we leave that one and going God
[45:47] don't leave things unfinished he
[45:50] finishes what he starts is that right so
[45:56] now when the Lord godwyn
[45:58] he has he has appointed that remember
[46:00] that the covenants be adducts and all of
[46:03] these things were spoke through the Old
[46:06] Testament and there we find it within
[46:08] Isaiah is so much that that is wrote and
[46:11] placed within there as well as all
[46:13] throughout the Old Testament that
[46:16] salvation was coming to the Jews it
[46:18] would speak not only of salvation coming
[46:21] that the Messiah there was to be a
[46:24] visitation but it also goes into deal
[46:27] with where God Himself will finish that
[46:30] work with 144,000 because remember the
[46:34] gospel first was to be preached to the
[46:37] Jews because this is where as our
[46:41] salvation and how that that he would
[46:43] come and remember when we look at this
[46:46] there is a finishing up even now of the
[46:49] mystery of God the Holy Ghost gospel
[46:52] among the Gentiles in the forming of the
[46:55] bride of Jesus Christ his body his bride
[46:58] now this was the mystery that Paul would
[47:00] talk about these are things that though
[47:03] you and I by God's grace we can see it
[47:06] wrote in Isaiah it's rope for clearly
[47:09] there of that hidden mystery of the
[47:11] Gentile bride but it is not
[47:13] something that the Jews were seeing and
[47:16] recognizing at that time and remember
[47:18] they rejected his visitation just as the
[47:25] God turned from the Jews to the Gentiles
[47:28] we also realize that when God is
[47:31] finished with the Gentiles and we're
[47:33] living in the finishing time there's and
[47:38] there's no more there's not another age
[47:41] after this age there's not another
[47:43] message that's to come
[47:44] there's not another outpouring of the
[47:47] Holy Ghost for the Gentiles this is the
[47:50] finishing time
[47:54] and after God has done with the Gentiles
[47:58] win the last bride member has been
[48:00] called amen that the bride is raptured
[48:05] she's lifted from this earth she's
[48:08] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[48:10] eye and we go to the wedding supper
[48:13] there will not be another Gentile saved
[48:17] are you with me and it turns them to the
[48:22] Jews oh my and so without laboring upon
[48:27] that and coming into that think of how
[48:30] you know that Jesus or the angels when
[48:34] they were looking at Jesus ascends up
[48:36] and they were standing there and they
[48:38] were gazing you know when you gaze on
[48:40] something you're you're looking on it's
[48:42] not just like you somebody says hey look
[48:44] at this picture they aren't uh-huh no no
[48:46] you gaze on it you're looking at it but
[48:51] evidently they needed to make sure that
[48:54] was not what they were to be focused on
[48:57] they could see him go they could see him
[49:00] be received in a cloud but there was
[49:03] work to be done and in order for that
[49:06] work to be done they had to get back to
[49:09] Jerusalem because that's where the Holy
[49:12] Spirit was going to be poured out
[49:14] there's no way that they could
[49:17] accomplish it in their own humanistic
[49:20] way
[49:25] you can be ever so great in the mind but
[49:28] it is not the mind of man that defeats
[49:32] the enemy the enemy can outfox any man
[49:36] let me just tell you right now the
[49:38] precepts the foundations of this world
[49:41] I'm talk about the system now that is
[49:44] even present is based on reasoning and
[49:49] reasoning never brings peace amen that's
[49:56] why there's got to come something
[49:58] greater than reasoning now when we look
[50:04] at this in the word remember we've been
[50:06] reading from in Ephesians 4 and it
[50:09] speaks the one of the very first phrases
[50:14] here in the scriptures Ephesians 4:11 it
[50:17] says and he gave some apostles this is
[50:23] very first that's the very first mention
[50:25] now as we going down if we would read on
[50:28] down through the scripture but I'm not
[50:29] going to for sake of time tonight
[50:32] there is one purpose when we when you
[50:34] read down through that of Ephesians 4
[50:37] even though every one of these gifts
[50:40] they are all from the same diamond but
[50:43] they are all diverse they all have their
[50:48] part and it's just like when we look at
[50:51] it that as we've been you know looking
[50:53] at that in the body and how Paul would
[50:56] express that the hand itself is used to
[51:00] reach out and grab something but the
[51:03] hand cannot chew the food the hand does
[51:05] not process it but the hand has a part
[51:09] in it this is why when brother branham
[51:13] is talking about the word going out he
[51:16] mentions up some brothers one had found
[51:18] a lot of oil 25 million dollars worth
[51:20] and brother Brent said that brother
[51:22] brother family he said he has dedicated
[51:24] that to the work of the Lord to send out
[51:28] missions Betty says another one has and
[51:31] they come up with the white now these
[51:32] listen now these are believers now he
[51:35] said they come up with a way
[51:37] they can actually I'll somehow you know
[51:39] dehydrate the blood or freeze it and
[51:41] they're able to draw things out of it
[51:43] they had developed a way and a means to
[51:46] do that but out of that a great patent
[51:49] and a lot of money come out of it but he
[51:51] also was designating the money to sin
[51:55] brothers overseas
[51:57] you see God God works we're not it's not
[52:01] separate we all a God has intended that
[52:04] we work together so that things would be
[52:07] accomplished so we're we're depending on
[52:13] him whether it's through the hand
[52:15] whether it's through the arm the feet
[52:17] were depending on him now
[52:18] brother Brandon would say it like this
[52:20] here here when he deals with Apostle he
[52:23] said now for the perfecting of the
[52:25] church God has said in the church
[52:27] apostles and he says you say apostles
[52:29] now I don't know how would people ever
[52:32] want to change their name and call
[52:33] themselves missionaries instead of
[52:35] apostles I don't know but a missionary
[52:38] and an apostle is exactly the same thing
[52:40] same word one that is sent a missionary
[52:45] is an apostle so so an apostle is a
[52:48] missionary it's one that's been sent and
[52:50] when a man feels led of God and sent of
[52:54] God to go to Africa India that makes him
[52:57] an apostle or a missionary which ever
[53:00] way you want to call it let me just keep
[53:05] on doing read a few more places but the
[53:08] RAM goes into another place he says now
[53:10] in the baptism of the Holy Spirit go to
[53:14] the second paragraph there that's the
[53:16] first highest call a missionary and he
[53:19] says you say an apostle is a missionary
[53:22] absolutely go look in the dictionary and
[53:24] find out what the apostle means it means
[53:26] one that is sent they says what a
[53:29] missionary means one who sent the same
[53:32] thing the highest order is a missionary
[53:35] who travels the Seas for the Lord Jesus
[53:38] he goes on to say not one who makes out
[53:41] you know like he's an apostle but he
[53:44] stays home you see
[53:47] but one who really is a missionary an
[53:51] apostle now I'm only going to cover one
[53:54] avenue of this tonight but notice he
[53:57] goes on and he deals without you know
[54:00] you're in the will of God that you have
[54:02] to be when you're a missionary so it
[54:05] doesn't mean that brother Ben's not
[54:07] saying in what somebody says I'm a
[54:08] missionary well you must be in the will
[54:10] of God that's not what he's saying
[54:12] you must be in the will of God in order
[54:15] to be a missionary and if God has called
[54:17] you to be a missionary you're in the
[54:19] will of God is that right because the
[54:23] General Orders go into all the world
[54:25] preach the gospel to every creature he
[54:28] says now a missionary is a very fine
[54:31] word but I got a better word for it
[54:33] you're an apostle now what does the word
[54:35] apostle mean it means one cent he goes
[54:37] into this again and now in the next
[54:40] letter next paragraph so missionaries
[54:42] prophets evangelists teachers and
[54:44] pastors make up the church apostles
[54:46] prophets they call so as long as you're
[54:49] a missionary or an apostle you're one
[54:53] cent of God to a mission hallelujah
[54:59] there's a mission so when we look at
[55:02] that there is a purpose now I want to
[55:04] just think of this here let's look at
[55:06] this in Hebrews three Paul would pick
[55:09] this up and he would speak of the Lord
[55:11] Jesus and he says wherefore holy
[55:13] brethren partakers of the heavenly
[55:15] calling consider the Apostle and high
[55:19] priest of our profession Christ Jesus
[55:23] who was faithful to him that appointed
[55:26] him as also Moses was faithful in all
[55:30] his house so then there had to be one to
[55:35] bring this gospel to you and I and the
[55:40] end the end the first that of the
[55:42] apostle here is Jesus Christ he is the
[55:46] Apostle and high priest of our
[55:48] confession he is the one who was sit
[55:55] Isiah calls in Isaiah
[55:57] I think it's Isaiah 51 when you look at
[56:00] Isaiah 51 it would seem as though that
[56:03] that Isaiah is writing of himself or God
[56:06] would even be referring to Isaiah and
[56:08] yet Isaiah was his servant but he's
[56:10] speaking of his servant Christ the
[56:13] branch he's speaking of the Ministry of
[56:16] the Messiah that it would be that very
[56:19] servant that would bring back that of
[56:22] Israel back home
[56:25] he's the apostle he's one that has been
[56:28] sent let me just say it when we look at
[56:31] this here he is one who is sent now look
[56:35] how the Apostle look how the Lord Jesus
[56:37] when he comes he was not received among
[56:41] the religious people
[56:43] he wasn't received among them now there
[56:47] was a remnant that was waiting that was
[56:51] looking there were those who were
[56:53] waiting on the coming of the Messiah but
[56:56] when he came he went among the outcasts
[57:00] as a matter of fact the Pharisees had a
[57:03] problem with it because they said in
[57:06] Luke 15 this guy is friends with wine
[57:10] bidders and publicans but how are you
[57:15] gonna win them if you don't friend them
[57:18] come on somebody you gotta you gotta
[57:22] gain favor before you can ever drop
[57:25] anything how long do I have to wait for
[57:30] favor I'm getting to the end of this day
[57:32] I just gotta say something right now you
[57:34] wait until God as you say something God
[57:38] might not have you say nothing to that
[57:40] person are you with me we are under
[57:45] strict order do not cast your pearls
[57:47] before swine if you test the water and
[57:52] somebody seems like it's a little bit of
[57:55] me you give a little more see if it's a
[57:57] little bit more opening but we're not
[57:59] in the business of trying to cram that's
[58:01] not what an apostle does then listen now
[58:06] as a believer even where God has called
[58:09] us out from the world and God has sent
[58:12] you and I to be a witness God never
[58:15] called you and I to cram anything that
[58:17] man I gotta make somebody see it we
[58:19] can't make nobody see this truth you
[58:24] can't make nobody I don't care how well
[58:26] you can explain it I don't care how well
[58:28] you know the words the Greek of the
[58:30] Hebrew that is not what turns the heart
[58:34] it takes God to come down and turn that
[58:37] heart is that right
[58:40] a man who said in the church all the
[58:43] time and brother Ram talk to you about
[58:45] here he was he was watching the Sun come
[58:47] up and the Sun preached a message to him
[58:51] and he repented and give his life to God
[58:58] think about Jesus talked about the
[59:00] prodigal think about what the Ministry
[59:02] of the Lord Jesus
[59:03] here was a ministry that was coming to
[59:07] seek and save that which is lost well if
[59:11] something is lost at one time it was
[59:13] found is that right yet had I belong he
[59:19] come to seek and save which is lost so
[59:21] now it's got to be a ministry the
[59:23] Ministry of the son of man is to recover
[59:26] redeem what belongs to one now here the
[59:30] Lord Jesus look at this look how this is
[59:32] declared here's the Apostle and high
[59:35] priest of our confession in Luke 4 and
[59:38] right after he's been baptized with the
[59:41] Holy Ghost
[59:42] here God stepping on the inside the
[59:44] Bible says in Luke 4:17 there was
[59:47] delivered unto Him the book of the
[59:50] prophet Isaiah
[59:51] and when he had opened the book he found
[59:54] the place where it was written the
[59:56] Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[59:59] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:00:03] the poor he has sent me to heal up the
[1:00:06] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[1:00:09] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:00:11] the blind
[1:00:13] said it liberty them that are bruised
[1:00:15] he's on a mission he's on a mission
[1:00:21] Jesus did not come here without a
[1:00:23] mission he came here to do the will of
[1:00:27] him that sent him he was on a mission a
[1:00:32] missionary an apostle he was on a
[1:00:35] mission let me just say this to you
[1:00:37] right now when God speaks to your heart
[1:00:40] how brother Brandon would place it like
[1:00:43] this God calls you out of where you were
[1:00:45] in the world and now you're walking in a
[1:00:48] land as a sojourner as a stranger is if
[1:00:52] God calls you out like an apostle you've
[1:00:55] been sent by God to be a witness you
[1:00:58] used to run around and have all sorts of
[1:01:01] things and whether you ran around or not
[1:01:03] you had all sorts of worldliness in your
[1:01:06] life come on now you had a love for the
[1:01:10] world but God calls you out of the world
[1:01:13] here we still walk in the world maybe
[1:01:16] you walk in the same job but being
[1:01:18] called out of the world doesn't mean you
[1:01:20] left your job he calls you out of that
[1:01:22] old sin nature like he called Abraham
[1:01:26] away from his kindred away from that old
[1:01:29] sin nature God is calling out his
[1:01:32] children like he sent Moses down to
[1:01:35] Egypt he said say unto Pharaoh let my
[1:01:38] son go that he might serve me this is
[1:01:43] not the Son of God this is the son of
[1:01:46] God this is what the word speaks to the
[1:01:52] flesh can feel good but the word comes
[1:01:55] to give authority to the inside man that
[1:01:58] says raise up look at this mission to
[1:02:07] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:02:12] this is recovery
[1:02:15] this is to redeem this is to come back
[1:02:17] to your they knew what this meant in
[1:02:20] Israel it meant to come back into your
[1:02:22] inheritance the land that belonged to
[1:02:25] you the bondage you had sold yourself in
[1:02:28] to come back out of that bondage come
[1:02:30] back to your land come back to your
[1:02:32] rightful inheritance that's what this
[1:02:35] was announcing it was announcing this is
[1:02:38] the acceptable year or has it would be
[1:02:41] place the Jubilee year and after this
[1:02:46] Jubilee year there would be seven
[1:02:48] Sabbath they would have to wait then of
[1:02:50] 49 years and to the fiftieth until the
[1:02:54] next Jubilee King is was a sounding out
[1:02:59] that's why the gospel calls out let him
[1:03:02] that hath an ear here it sounds out so
[1:03:09] he closes the book he gives it to the
[1:03:12] minister and sit down in the eyes of all
[1:03:14] them that were in the synagogue were
[1:03:16] fastened on him and he began to say unto
[1:03:19] them this day is this scripture
[1:03:22] fulfilled in your ears how many times
[1:03:26] they had had that read but they never
[1:03:31] had that exclamation point put after it
[1:03:34] what brought the exclamation point this
[1:03:38] day is this scripture that has just read
[1:03:40] fulfilled in your ears God was present
[1:03:45] in Christ
[1:03:49] any time God comes on the scene he's the
[1:03:53] one that brings the exclamation point to
[1:03:55] the word here he was the Lamb of God
[1:03:59] think of it the Holy Ghost has not even
[1:04:01] been given I want you to think of this
[1:04:03] in the earthly Jim journey when he comes
[1:04:06] to the River Jordan here John John would
[1:04:10] not have known him had the Holy Ghost
[1:04:12] not pointed him out he looks like
[1:04:15] anybody else let me just say it like
[1:04:20] this
[1:04:20] if there was a lineup of ten people of
[1:04:23] who could be the Lamb of God Jesus might
[1:04:25] not have made the lineup
[1:04:27] are you with me you say why did you say
[1:04:30] that ko City is not about these eyes
[1:04:32] recognizing it you don't see with these
[1:04:35] eyes you see with these eyes down here
[1:04:41] remember these eyes will deceive you
[1:04:44] these eyes will say there's a hook oh
[1:04:46] we're outnumbered but these are down
[1:04:48] here said there's more with us unless
[1:04:54] these eyes get an on to here you'll
[1:04:56] never see the kingdom of God is that
[1:05:00] right
[1:05:00] it just becomes who's watching who am i
[1:05:02] around but I wonder who I'll see if I go
[1:05:04] to the store I wonder who about to do
[1:05:06] that you're looking with these eyes but
[1:05:07] when you've got these eyes on the inside
[1:05:09] you're no longer worried about who you
[1:05:11] see right here you have met the author
[1:05:13] of life and your desires and nature's
[1:05:16] have changed brother and the only thing
[1:05:19] you desire is to please him he was the
[1:05:24] Lamb of God the true atonement on earth
[1:05:28] how much you think of this Jesus here
[1:05:31] right after the Jordan he didn't just
[1:05:33] walk to Calvary there was a Ministry of
[1:05:38] three and a half years but the true
[1:05:40] atonement was on earth are you with me
[1:05:44] not only will see the provided sacrifice
[1:05:47] and he was to become our high priest but
[1:05:51] to think now he was not going to become
[1:05:53] a high priest after the order of Aaron
[1:05:55] no they just keep on dying and passing
[1:05:59] on and those are in Institute's of
[1:06:01] orders and everything that this one is
[1:06:03] going to be after the order of
[1:06:05] Melchizedek
[1:06:08] this is who it is the same one who met
[1:06:11] Abraham the same one come down and
[1:06:14] become our sacrifice
[1:06:18] while he was in his earthly ministry in
[1:06:21] his own corporal body what he did in
[1:06:24] that body what he did in that body is
[1:06:28] the same thing that he does in his
[1:06:31] earthly mystical body that of believers
[1:06:36] of children of God that are our makeup
[1:06:41] this body and are born by his Spirit the
[1:06:45] same way that he acted in that body is
[1:06:48] the same way that he acts in this body
[1:06:52] you asked me he said the works that I do
[1:06:56] shall you do also it's the same Jesus in
[1:07:02] a redeemed bride body Jesus said it like
[1:07:06] this and this this has to be the
[1:07:08] testimony of each and every life every
[1:07:11] apostle every missionary every witness
[1:07:14] of God he that sent me is with me the
[1:07:18] father hath not let me alone
[1:07:22] sometimes you might feel alone but he
[1:07:25] ain't left you alone he said though I'm
[1:07:27] with you always you may not seem like
[1:07:31] you've got the answer right then but
[1:07:33] just wait he still leads his children
[1:07:38] for I do always those things which
[1:07:40] please him now notice in Luke 4 let's
[1:07:43] continue here in Luke 4 when the Sun was
[1:07:46] setting and all day that had any sick
[1:07:48] with desire divers diseases brought them
[1:07:50] unto him and he laid his hands on them
[1:07:53] and healed them and the devil's also
[1:07:56] came out of many crying out and saying
[1:07:58] thou art the Christ the Son of God and
[1:08:01] He rebuking them suffered them not to
[1:08:04] speak for they knew that he was Christ
[1:08:07] and when it was day he departed and went
[1:08:10] into a desert place and the people
[1:08:12] sought him and he came unto him and
[1:08:14] stayed him that he should not depart
[1:08:17] from them and he said unto them I must
[1:08:21] preach the kingdom of God to other
[1:08:23] cities also for therefore am I sent this
[1:08:31] is the Apostle and he preached in the
[1:08:34] synagogue's of Galilee now Matthew 10
[1:08:39] look where when the Lord Jesus here is
[1:08:41] is because called disciples there has
[1:08:44] been every one of these disciples and
[1:08:46] here they are of the 12 disciples notice
[1:08:49] in just this account in Matthew when he
[1:08:51] had called unto him his 12 disciples he
[1:08:55] gave them power against unclean spirits
[1:08:57] to cast them out and to heal all manner
[1:09:01] of sickness and all manner of disease
[1:09:03] and it goes through the names of the
[1:09:05] Twelve Apostles are these salmon who's
[1:09:08] first called Peter Andrew his brother
[1:09:10] James the son of Zebedee and John his
[1:09:13] brother Philip and Bartholomew Thomas
[1:09:16] and Matthew the publican James the son
[1:09:19] of Alphaeus and lobbyists whose surname
[1:09:21] was thaddaeus simon the canaanite and
[1:09:24] judas iscariot who also betrayed him who
[1:09:30] Judas was part of the original apostles
[1:09:34] they come and follow me
[1:09:38] he had an apostle ship he was sent out
[1:09:43] with the rest of them and noticed and
[1:09:47] what I want you to catch here under this
[1:09:50] watch the leadership in the direction
[1:09:52] because God is the one who calls now
[1:09:56] remember with Judas you know in a mind
[1:09:58] and I just want to to lay that in you
[1:10:01] know it could look in the scriptures say
[1:10:02] well Judas yeah he's an apostle he's one
[1:10:05] that you know that that turned him down
[1:10:07] but remember gifts and callings are
[1:10:09] without repentance a man that can sing a
[1:10:13] man that can Rider a woman what have you
[1:10:16] they'll give an account for that gift
[1:10:19] where everyone will give an account let
[1:10:21] me just bring it on down for the gifts
[1:10:23] and talents that God has put within your
[1:10:26] life you give an account on what you do
[1:10:28] with them brother Branham came up to
[1:10:31] preach behind a man that had just been
[1:10:33] whistling in different bird language
[1:10:36] hello he came up behind it and I wonder
[1:10:39] him you know man if if we didn't have
[1:10:41] this on tape and it happened maybe in a
[1:10:43] message Church somebody's like man
[1:10:45] that's carnal brother branham came right
[1:10:46] up behind it he said did you hear how
[1:10:48] he's sung the gospel in that bird
[1:10:50] language he whistled it chirped it out
[1:10:54] you know what he came around and said he
[1:10:56] said there is a part in that for that to
[1:11:00] be expressed just like those who sing
[1:11:02] songs those who preach the gospel he
[1:11:04] goes on he says whatever that God has
[1:11:06] called you to do bill it
[1:11:12] hmm it may not be a song I'd request a
[1:11:15] lot but under his leadership and this is
[1:11:22] under his leadership in direction this
[1:11:24] is what the Ministry of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:26] he comes to lead his church notice in
[1:11:28] verse five he sins that these twelve
[1:11:31] Jesus sent forth and commanded them
[1:11:33] saying go not in the way of the Gentiles
[1:11:35] and into any city of the Samaritans
[1:11:38] enter ye not
[1:11:40] don't go there right now but go rather
[1:11:45] to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
[1:11:49] so now he's sending the Apostles for
[1:11:52] what get after the lost sheep of Israel
[1:11:54] that's what an apostle is gone for this
[1:11:57] is not just to say very clear the work
[1:12:01] of the ministry it's not an occupation
[1:12:05] we'll bring it down to your life for a
[1:12:07] beer Christian it's not an occupation
[1:12:09] it's not something you punch in and
[1:12:11] punch out it's got to be that you are
[1:12:13] called to it and man it becomes a burden
[1:12:18] on your heart to please him to live for
[1:12:21] him
[1:12:22] a man is together the lost sheep of the
[1:12:26] house of Israel and as you go preach
[1:12:31] saying the kingdom of heaven is a hand
[1:12:35] heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise
[1:12:39] the dead cast out Devils freely you have
[1:12:42] received freely give provide neither
[1:12:45] gold nor silver nor brass in your purses
[1:12:47] nor scrip for your journey neither two
[1:12:50] coats neither shoes nor yet States for
[1:12:53] the workman is worthy of his meat you
[1:12:55] know what he's letting them know I'm
[1:12:56] sending you I'll take care of you whom
[1:13:00] God sins he takes care when God leads
[1:13:05] you somewhere the grace of God that
[1:13:07] leads you that will keep you that's the
[1:13:11] beauty of it if you've knocked down the
[1:13:13] door you'll have to knock down the doors
[1:13:15] to keep it open but God has led you
[1:13:18] there you can rest it don't mean the
[1:13:21] trials ain't going to come if domaine
[1:13:23] tests aren't gonna come that's what
[1:13:24] knowing the will of God does it gives
[1:13:26] you stability when tests and trials come
[1:13:29] your way and situations come against you
[1:13:33] you have something to say I know that
[1:13:35] God has sent me this way hallelujah
[1:13:40] hallelujah that applies to all of our
[1:13:43] lives and into whatsoever city or town
[1:13:46] you shall enter inquire who in it is
[1:13:49] worthy and there abide till you go hence
[1:13:53] and when you come into a house saluted
[1:13:56] and if the house be worthy let your
[1:13:59] peace come upon it but if it be not
[1:14:00] worthy let your peace return to you so
[1:14:03] in other words and an apostle apostles
[1:14:06] not coming here into the church apostle
[1:14:10] is one who is sent and they're coming
[1:14:13] into areas where there is no church
[1:14:18] that's why Paul could say as apostles we
[1:14:22] are made spectacles unto men unto angels
[1:14:24] and unto others
[1:14:28] we're men as Paul would say in
[1:14:30] Corinthians they deem us as fools they
[1:14:33] cut Paul Paul would go stand before
[1:14:35] great learning men and he would speak
[1:14:39] the gospel not that the whole crowd was
[1:14:42] going to come sometimes it would be worn
[1:14:45] out of there the gospel is not about a
[1:14:49] crowd the Gospels about the lost sheep
[1:14:51] and if the house be worthy let your
[1:14:57] peace come upon it but if it be not
[1:15:00] worthy let your peace return to you you
[1:15:03] think about that in Philip I my goodness
[1:15:06] when Paul was in a you know in a strait
[1:15:08] he and Silas but think about God had
[1:15:11] been there in that situation because the
[1:15:14] Philippian jailer God sent him there and
[1:15:19] it did not you know look what was going
[1:15:21] on in Philippi but God had him there so
[1:15:24] that Philippian jailer could hear the
[1:15:26] gospel and when he received the gospel
[1:15:30] notice peace came upon his house the
[1:15:34] word found him worthy he welcomed the
[1:15:37] word in what must we do to be saved
[1:15:42] brother Branham takes that up in the
[1:15:44] message the house he said we're so busy
[1:15:45] telling people what you shouldn't do and
[1:15:48] don't do this and don't do that he said
[1:15:49] telling what they ought to do what
[1:15:52] belief if you really believe sin will
[1:15:58] flee
[1:16:00] it just takes simple faith in the word
[1:16:04] God you said that I believe it and you
[1:16:08] accept that more where it comes I accept
[1:16:10] that you stand on that you believe on
[1:16:13] the Lord Jesus Christ whosoever shall
[1:16:18] not receive you nor hear your words when
[1:16:20] you depart out of that house or city
[1:16:21] shake off the dust off of your feet
[1:16:23] verily I say unto you it shall be more
[1:16:26] tolerable for the land of Sodom and
[1:16:28] Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for
[1:16:30] that City
[1:16:33] that's true
[1:16:41] wonder even and how the message has come
[1:16:44] over the years it's coming there were
[1:16:47] certain cities the message came right
[1:16:49] into and yet right in the midst of that
[1:16:51] city no churches newspapers attacked it
[1:16:58] didn't go on and on but that don't mean
[1:17:03] all the city was against it there was
[1:17:08] some elect so much subtle that it could
[1:17:15] be spoken
[1:17:16] just like Nathanael could say what good
[1:17:19] can come out of Nazareth the city you're
[1:17:23] from whoa you might have a bad
[1:17:25] reputation but you get called from
[1:17:30] another country glory be to God
[1:17:36] Oh mah good ordained to eternal life now
[1:17:40] let me just let me move on here into
[1:17:43] this into this part how that Paul would
[1:17:46] go on in Romans 10 just get down there
[1:17:48] with me for just a moment in Romans 10
[1:17:50] twelve familiar Scripture there's no
[1:17:53] difference between the Jew and the Greek
[1:17:54] for the same lord over all is rich unto
[1:17:57] all that call upon him for whosoever
[1:18:00] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[1:18:03] shall be saved now then how shall they
[1:18:08] call on him in whom they have not
[1:18:10] believed and how shall they believe in
[1:18:13] him whom they have not heard and how
[1:18:15] shall they hear without a preacher how
[1:18:18] shall they preach except they be sent
[1:18:22] all he said how beautiful are the feet
[1:18:25] of them that preach the gospel of peace
[1:18:28] and bring glad tidings of good things
[1:18:29] but they have not obeyed the gospel not
[1:18:32] all have obeyed the gospel for Isaiah
[1:18:34] said Lord who has believed our report so
[1:18:37] then faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:18:40] by the Word of God but I say have they
[1:18:43] not heard yes verily their sound went
[1:18:47] into all the earth and their words unto
[1:18:49] the ends of the world
[1:18:55] now here in Romans 11 13 Paul would
[1:19:00] express for I speak to you Gentiles in
[1:19:05] as much as I am the apostle of the
[1:19:09] Gentiles I magnify mine office this is
[1:19:14] one of the few places where Paul is
[1:19:16] affirmatively declaring what God has
[1:19:19] revealed to him personally his position
[1:19:24] his in the economy of God
[1:19:29] now these assertions because there were
[1:19:33] many others who were coming around and
[1:19:35] saying this and saying that but you know
[1:19:37] it was more than Paul just saying this
[1:19:39] Paul wasn't a braggart
[1:19:42] Paul was not that kind of a guy as a
[1:19:48] matter of fact Paul would have the
[1:19:49] testimony in first Corinthians 59 I'm
[1:19:52] the least of the Apostles and I'm not me
[1:19:56] to be called an apostle because I
[1:19:58] persecuted the Church of God
[1:20:00] Paul knew it was God's grace he knew it
[1:20:05] was the grace of God that he was
[1:20:06] standing there by Paul was not looking
[1:20:09] at it that he wasn't worthy of God's
[1:20:10] grace he just saying God how God has
[1:20:12] ordained me to be an apostle
[1:20:14] I wasn't even me to be an apostle but
[1:20:18] God called him to be an apostle things
[1:20:22] that involves life in the past that
[1:20:25] could have seemed so detrimental but God
[1:20:28] had called him to be an apostle brother
[1:20:33] when God speaks it supersedes uh
[1:20:41] understand I believe God keeps his hand
[1:20:44] upon a man's life I believe God watches
[1:20:47] over a man so that there are
[1:20:48] qualifications that are met met within
[1:20:51] the ministry but think of Paul's life
[1:20:53] Paul when he could look back and say I'm
[1:20:55] not even worthy of this right here but
[1:20:58] you know it was that very attitude that
[1:21:00] wouldn't allow Paul to be used by God
[1:21:04] because the very moment a person thinks
[1:21:06] they're worthy and can do something
[1:21:07] that's the sure son they're not usable
[1:21:14] this is why when God would reveal
[1:21:17] himself to Paul Paul would would account
[1:21:20] of this in acts 20 acts 26 15 when he's
[1:21:23] in here he is recalling this account as
[1:21:26] he standing there who art our Lord and
[1:21:28] he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutors
[1:21:31] rise and stand upon my feet for I have
[1:21:33] appeared unto thee for this purpose to
[1:21:36] make the a minister and a witness both
[1:21:39] of these things which thou has seen and
[1:21:42] of those things in which I will appear
[1:21:44] unto thee delivering thee from the
[1:21:47] people and from the Gentiles unto whom
[1:21:49] now I Cindi to open their eyes to turn
[1:21:53] them from darkness to light and from the
[1:21:56] power of Satan unto God that they may
[1:21:58] receive forgiveness of sins and
[1:22:00] inheritance among them which are
[1:22:03] sanctified by faith that is in me
[1:22:07] this is a purpose is sent with a mission
[1:22:13] now notice how Paul the countess would
[1:22:16] go with an Apostle Paul would declare he
[1:22:23] says in verse 17 of Romans 15 I have
[1:22:27] therefore wherever I may glory through
[1:22:29] Jesus Christ in those things which
[1:22:31] pertain to God well I will not dare to
[1:22:34] speak of any of those things which
[1:22:36] Christ hath not wrought by me to make
[1:22:39] the Gentiles obedient by word and deed
[1:22:41] through mighty signs and wonders and I
[1:22:44] want you to just just to hang on to that
[1:22:47] for a moment through mighty signs and
[1:22:49] wonders by the power of the Spirit of
[1:22:51] God so that from Jerusalem and
[1:22:54] roundabout electrum I have fully
[1:22:58] preached the gospel of Christ notice
[1:23:01] from Jerusalem yay
[1:23:07] so have I strived to preach the gospel
[1:23:10] not where Christ was named this is an
[1:23:18] apostle this is a missionary now listen
[1:23:22] an apostle can be sent in may be there's
[1:23:26] a church and how that they invite they
[1:23:28] invite this man in to come and minister
[1:23:30] and this is a denominational Church
[1:23:33] and that man brings the gospel of Jesus
[1:23:37] Christ even though here they are as a
[1:23:39] church but it brings them into a reality
[1:23:42] with wisdom if God leads him to go right
[1:23:47] into that a prophet has come then so be
[1:23:49] it
[1:23:50] but in many times those are things that
[1:23:52] will be shut down quickly but this is
[1:23:54] why Jesus could say be wise as a serpent
[1:23:56] and harmless as a death is getting them
[1:23:59] to see that this is Scripture God can
[1:24:03] send a man in just like that when it's a
[1:24:07] mission and he's done that an apostle
[1:24:10] missionary sent it right in somewhere as
[1:24:12] Church will start right up from there
[1:24:14] others where an assembly our church or
[1:24:17] churches that there will be they'll be
[1:24:19] completely converted they will come to
[1:24:22] the light of the gospel some of them
[1:24:26] when they leave their denominations you
[1:24:28] know even if some of the testimonies
[1:24:30] we've out here the denominations takes a
[1:24:32] hold of their churches and kicks them
[1:24:33] out but as the pastors and those of the
[1:24:38] assembly that will go with them and they
[1:24:40] go with them to walk on into the light
[1:24:42] they go an apostle one who has sent
[1:24:48] there's an omission notice Paul Paul is
[1:24:51] going to preach the gospel where it's
[1:24:53] not named remember when brother Jason
[1:24:55] DeMars stood here
[1:24:58] back is over a year ago December of 2018
[1:25:04] I think it was and brother Jason going
[1:25:07] going among in those air in those areas
[1:25:12] among the Arabs and in some of those
[1:25:14] countries and even in certain ones where
[1:25:17] just couldn't even name the country
[1:25:19] because of going in there and all of the
[1:25:20] tightness around it
[1:25:24] it's not going it's not it's not just
[1:25:27] going in there just like myself going to
[1:25:29] preach a meeting somewhere he's going in
[1:25:31] there
[1:25:32] that's an apostle my brother Jason's
[1:25:35] never said that to me but you just look
[1:25:37] at how God has put the burden on his
[1:25:38] heart and then how the word has come to
[1:25:41] direct those things and lay that right
[1:25:42] in God has to have somebody equipped for
[1:25:45] that first we can say oh my I sure would
[1:25:50] like to go there you got to make sure
[1:25:51] it's not your imagination you need to
[1:25:56] know that God has called you and I know
[1:26:00] God had called me there not where Christ
[1:26:03] was named notice in verse 21 but as it
[1:26:07] is written to whom he was not spoken of
[1:26:10] they shall see and they that have not
[1:26:14] heard shall understand once you think of
[1:26:17] this here look at this example when Paul
[1:26:20] would go as an apostle paul would enter
[1:26:26] in and we find this is something I want
[1:26:28] you to just to look at this for a moment
[1:26:29] in the scripture you find you back in
[1:26:35] acts 8 without reading it the church
[1:26:39] here the church is just moving forward I
[1:26:43] mean they've just God has just done such
[1:26:46] a marvelous work just the outpouring of
[1:26:49] the Holy Ghost signs and wonders are
[1:26:51] being done souls are being added to the
[1:26:54] church
[1:26:57] but God says this has got to get out
[1:27:01] this has got to get out God's not trying
[1:27:05] to create a communal environment let's
[1:27:11] let's all get out let's let let's all
[1:27:12] let's build a housing division and let's
[1:27:14] all just live together then what God's
[1:27:17] trying to do we are we we live in Christ
[1:27:21] but notice God permits the very one were
[1:27:24] reading about who at that time was named
[1:27:27] Saul he permits havoc and persecution to
[1:27:32] come against the Church of the Living
[1:27:34] God and the Bible says they were
[1:27:36] scattered gone allowed him to be
[1:27:40] scattered but God utilized that
[1:27:44] persecution because the Bible says they
[1:27:46] went everywhere preaching the gospel
[1:27:49] sometimes God will take us take
[1:27:51] situations just like that you utilize
[1:27:54] them for his glory God is always in
[1:27:57] control it's always in our hearts God
[1:28:02] looking for an opportunity what would
[1:28:04] you have me do right now when this
[1:28:06] opportunity this is taking place this is
[1:28:09] going on
[1:28:17] you find Paul let me just try to just
[1:28:20] just wrap this up here tonight
[1:28:27] but Paul here he comes he's right here
[1:28:30] in in Corinth and in acts 18 verse 7 he
[1:28:34] departed fence and he entered into a
[1:28:36] certain man's house named Justice one
[1:28:39] that worshipped God whose house joined
[1:28:42] hard to the synagogue and Crispus the
[1:28:45] chief ruler of the synagogue believed on
[1:28:47] the Lord with all his house and many of
[1:28:49] the Corinthians hearing believed and
[1:28:51] were baptized then spake the Lord to
[1:28:55] Paul in the night by vision be not
[1:28:58] afraid but speak and hold not thy peace
[1:29:02] God would have never told him don't be
[1:29:04] afraid if he wasn't afraid God wouldn't
[1:29:07] have told him speak if he didn't feel
[1:29:09] like speaking no more and I don't want
[1:29:14] you to hold your peace here's why for I
[1:29:18] am with thee and no man shall set on me
[1:29:23] to hurt thee for I have much people in
[1:29:26] this city that City right there Paul
[1:29:33] felling and by the scripture know that
[1:29:35] he felt like giving up many have
[1:29:37] believed yeah there's been those whose
[1:29:38] belief but he's letting Paul know don't
[1:29:41] you leave here right now you see an
[1:29:43] apostle a missionary there under the
[1:29:46] direction of God how long do I stay I
[1:29:50] have your orders
[1:29:55] I have your orders and he stayed there
[1:29:59] under a call of God because there were
[1:30:02] many people I have much people did you
[1:30:08] notice what God called him they're my
[1:30:10] people I've redeemed them I shed my
[1:30:14] blood they were in my mind before the
[1:30:16] foundation of the world they were
[1:30:19] covered over with all sorts of things
[1:30:21] Paul went in address that but they were
[1:30:23] God's people they needed to hear the
[1:30:26] gospel they are all sorts of conditions
[1:30:30] about their life but the devil could
[1:30:33] tell him you're not even worthy but God
[1:30:37] would call to them and bring them home
[1:30:42] and he continued there a year and six
[1:30:47] months teaching the Word of God among
[1:30:52] them who had him stay there God did for
[1:30:58] what purpose there was a need after the
[1:31:03] people had come in there was a need to
[1:31:06] teach them the Word of God that's
[1:31:09] another aspect of an apostle and we'll
[1:31:14] stop there tonight God will go for one
[1:31:21] God will send for one piece one person
[1:31:29] God might have you in the job you're in
[1:31:31] now for one person the department you're
[1:31:35] in now for one person one day he stopped
[1:31:43] he said I must need to go by Samaria he
[1:31:47] was sent to Samaria and there was a
[1:31:52] woman this appointment was already
[1:31:56] arranged in the mind of God she walked
[1:32:00] away from that well a different person
[1:32:03] that day she met him he was led to that
[1:32:09] moment Paul led in another place you
[1:32:15] know as you read in the book of Acts
[1:32:16] sometimes they don't know where where do
[1:32:18] we go God do we go into Asia right now
[1:32:21] and Paul the Bible said he has saved
[1:32:23] tested it should we go here November 1
[1:32:27] in the Macedonian in Macedonian garb
[1:32:32] garb you understand it's the native
[1:32:35] things that would stand out this is
[1:32:37] Macedonia and it says come to us Paul
[1:32:43] knew by that dream that vision do not go
[1:32:47] into Asia go to Macedonia that's where
[1:32:51] the sheep were at that moment there were
[1:32:56] sheep in Asia but everything is in God's
[1:32:58] time it's in God's time God is the one
[1:33:05] who is orchestrating and leading it and
[1:33:07] this is what as an apostle just one
[1:33:10] Avenue is one who is sent
[1:33:13] it's a missionary
[1:33:16] and another part of us were looking at
[1:33:18] here and we're just closed tonight it's
[1:33:20] one who comes and he sets things in
[1:33:24] order to see that a church is
[1:33:29] established Apostles very important
[1:33:35] Jesus himself
[1:33:37] picks it up in Revelations 21 and the
[1:33:41] Foundation's even of that New Jerusalem
[1:33:44] is built upon the 12 apostles the body
[1:33:50] of Jesus Christ Paul picks it up in in
[1:33:53] Ephesians it's built upon that
[1:33:56] foundation of the apostles and the
[1:33:58] prophets not the men but the revelation
[1:34:01] of Jesus Christ the true doctrine of the
[1:34:07] word foundation is very important
[1:34:14] I tell you I'm grateful to God for a
[1:34:18] word that is coming this day aren't you
[1:34:24] glad that the word come to you now you
[1:34:28] might say but the same thing I was born
[1:34:31] and raised in a message pew but aren't
[1:34:33] you glad the word came to you it's more
[1:34:37] than just well I've always said I've
[1:34:39] always been in this church or I've
[1:34:40] always been around the message but it's
[1:34:42] where he comes to you he comes to you
[1:34:47] and he makes himself known personally to
[1:34:51] you that you're included in Calvary
[1:34:57] you've been included in the resurrection
[1:35:00] because I live you shall live awesome he
[1:35:05] comes to deliver a personal message in
[1:35:09] that tremendous in the tremendous how
[1:35:11] that God would come right down and he
[1:35:14] brought somebody across your weight some
[1:35:16] of you you know I can't say this but
[1:35:19] some of you that were not even around
[1:35:21] the message didn't even know anything
[1:35:23] about it but somebody shared it with you
[1:35:27] somebody was obedient to the Lord
[1:35:32] somebody shared this good news aren't
[1:35:38] you glad that it came to you aren't you
[1:35:40] glad that they yielded and shared this
[1:35:42] word look what it's done in our lives oh
[1:35:46] oh how accountable how accountable that
[1:35:51] we are may God help us to be as yielded
[1:35:54] as the person was that surrendered and
[1:35:55] gave us our first tape our first book or
[1:35:58] told us come see
[1:36:03] we're commissioned by God a trust these
[1:36:08] things become a little bit more clear
[1:36:10] just more as we're just laying it and
[1:36:12] just trying to teach this these things
[1:36:14] to see that part and that's necessary
[1:36:17] everything every one of these parts and
[1:36:20] within our lives every one of us has a
[1:36:24] part and nobody can take your place if
[1:36:30] these ain't just good words it's the
[1:36:32] absolute truth nobody can take your
[1:36:35] place
[1:36:39] but I say Lord Here I am what if what I
[1:36:45] have I give it to you I don't have much
[1:36:50] but I give it to you Lord I'll give
[1:36:53] everything I give all mall
