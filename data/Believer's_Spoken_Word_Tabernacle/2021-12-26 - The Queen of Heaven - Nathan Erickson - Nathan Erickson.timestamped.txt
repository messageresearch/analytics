[36:05] we're gonna miss brother samuel being
[36:07] here today but just happy that we can be
[36:09] of a help and i hope that's all what we

[36:23] years we want to say god bless you i
[36:25] hope you had a wonderful merry christmas
[36:27] with your family
[36:28] and are enjoying this holiday season a
[36:30] little bit of a break
[36:31] amen and we just love you in the lord
[36:34] god bless you let's go to the word of
[36:36] god
[36:38] in esther the fourth chapter
[36:44] amen and uh i got a little thought here
[36:47] i just been studying on and
[36:49] preaching on at home and
[36:52] been really enjoying this it's quite a
[36:55] lot to bring out so i just trust the
[36:56] lord will give utterance
[36:58] and uh
[37:00] and put it together just the way he
[37:02] wants it this morning
[37:04] but i've been preaching on
[37:07] on the
[37:08] queen of heaven my title tonight
[37:11] the queen of heaven
[37:13] quite an unusual
[37:15] uh phrase but i've just been blessed by
[37:17] this study so esther chapter 4
[37:19] and verse 11 i this is one of my
[37:21] favorite
[37:22] moments of the stories of the bible i
[37:24] think it's quite dramatic
[37:26] it's quite striking has a very relevant
[37:29] meaning for our day and for our for our
[37:32] own relationship with the lord and the
[37:34] ministry of this bride in esther 4
[37:37] verse 11. this is her words
[37:39] all the king's servants
[37:41] and the people of the king's provinces
[37:43] do know that whomsoever whether man or
[37:46] woman shall come unto the king in the
[37:47] inner court who is not called there is
[37:50] one law of his to put him to death
[37:52] except such to whom the king shall hold
[37:55] out
[37:55] the golden scepter that he may live but
[37:58] i have not been called to come into the
[38:00] king these thirty days
[38:01] and they told the mordecai esther's
[38:03] words
[38:04] then mordecai commanded of course you
[38:06] know the background of this story we're
[38:08] well acquainted with the story of esther
[38:10] mordecai replied there's a persecution
[38:13] coming for her people and so mordecai
[38:15] replies to her says think not with
[38:18] thyself that thou shalt escape in the
[38:20] king's house more than all the jews
[38:22] for if thou holdest thy peace at this
[38:24] time
[38:25] then shall there be enlargement and
[38:26] deliverance arise to the jews from
[38:27] another place but thou in thy father's
[38:29] house
[38:30] shall be destroyed and who knoweth
[38:32] whether thou art come to the kingdom
[38:35] for such a time as this
[38:37] for such a time as this
[38:39] esther made them return this answer go
[38:42] gather together all the jews that are
[38:43] present in shushan
[38:45] and fast for me and neither eat or drink
[38:47] three days night or day
[38:49] i also and my mains will fast likewise
[38:51] and so will i go in unto the king
[38:54] which is not according to the law
[38:56] and if i perish
[38:58] i perish
[39:00] if i perish
[39:02] i perish let the desperation that moment
[39:05] just
[39:05] settle in
[39:06] this morning
[39:08] amen and then uh to to continue laying a
[39:12] foundation here let's take a reading
[39:13] from luke chapter one
[39:15] a little bit of a christmas passage here
[39:18] it's not a i don't have a christmas
[39:20] sermon this morning per se
[39:23] but this goes right along with the
[39:24] thought and i've been blessed by this
[39:26] reading
[39:27] in luke chapter 1
[39:30] and we'll read the 30th to the 38th
[39:33] verses
[39:35] and the angel said unto mary fear not
[39:38] for thou has found favor with god
[39:42] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[39:45] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[39:46] call his name
[39:48] jesus
[39:49] he shall be great
[39:51] and called the son of the highest and
[39:52] the lord god shall give unto him the
[39:54] throne of his father david and he shall
[39:56] reign over the house of jacob forever
[39:58] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[40:02] and mary said on the angel how
[40:04] how shall this be
[40:06] seeing i know not a man
[40:07] the angel answered and said unto her the
[40:09] holy ghost shall come upon thee the
[40:11] power of the highest shall overshadow
[40:12] thee therefore also that holy thing
[40:15] which shall be born of thee shall be
[40:17] called
[40:18] the son of god
[40:19] and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath
[40:22] also conceived a son in her old age
[40:24] this is the sixth month with her who was
[40:25] called barren for with god nothing shall
[40:28] be impossible
[40:30] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[40:32] lord
[40:33] be it unto me
[40:34] according to thy word
[40:36] and the angel departed from her amen
[40:39] let's have a word of prayer lord it's a

[41:40] amen this scripture just so reminded me
[41:41] did i give the testimony here at this
[41:43] church yet about my wife and i
[41:45] and i i didn't think so because i think
[41:47] it was too early on last time i was here
[41:50] but uh speaking of elizabeth's womb
[41:51] there and just to uh give share a little
[41:54] testimony what the lord is doing in our
[41:55] life
[41:56] we had a we had an experience my wife
[41:59] and i earlier this year sometime in the
[42:01] spring i think
[42:03] with a um with a specialist
[42:06] a fertility specialist and we were told
[42:08] that that the little girl that we have
[42:11] was basically statistically a miracle
[42:14] and that we were never going to be able
[42:15] to bring forth children and if we were
[42:17] to have if we were to able to conceive
[42:20] again
[42:20] that uh that we would just miscarry
[42:23] again we've had four miscarriages some
[42:25] quite traumatic so uh so you know that
[42:28] uh to to be honest with you that would
[42:30] have been quite all right with me that
[42:32] report because we have our little girl
[42:34] and she's my whole world and if i if i
[42:36] never had another child you know i would
[42:38] be content of course with my my little
[42:40] miracle but uh but the problem was that
[42:43] just two days prior to that i had been
[42:45] sitting in service at home on a on a
[42:47] sunday morning and and this is the way
[42:48] it goes sometimes with the lord if
[42:50] you're not careful you come with the
[42:51] wrong expectation and you're not
[42:53] listening with spiritual ears but the
[42:55] pastor was ministering and he was he was
[42:57] trying to remember a testimony brother
[42:58] ray was trying to recall the details of
[43:00] a testimony and to anybody who wasn't
[43:02] maybe in tune with it it might have
[43:04] seemed like the most human part of the
[43:06] service and you wouldn't have maybe
[43:08] called it anointed because he was
[43:09] stumbling at this time and trying to
[43:11] remember the details you know how it is
[43:13] sometimes and just off the cuff and
[43:14] trying to come up with the details but
[43:16] he was telling a testimony of a woman
[43:18] who uh who had actually had a full
[43:20] hysterectomy and miraculously was able
[43:22] to have a child after that fact and so
[43:25] you know it may not have seemed like a
[43:28] powerful part of the service but the
[43:29] lord just spoke to me right there
[43:32] and um and and it was just quite
[43:34] unexpected but the lord spoke to me and
[43:37] and the way that i've described it to to
[43:39] a lot of people was that uh you know it
[43:41] wasn't like a thus saith the lord but
[43:43] you know when something just quickens
[43:44] your heart faith quickens in your heart
[43:46] you want it you just lay hold of
[43:47] something and you say i'm believing for
[43:49] this and so i i had in my heart i'm
[43:52] believing uh i'm believing
[43:54] that i'm gonna have a son with my wife
[43:56] and so that was the report so you know
[43:59] uh
[44:00] so uh that i so we had a bad report from
[44:03] the from the uh from medicine and and uh
[44:06] they told us that it would have to be
[44:08] art some sort of artificial method is
[44:10] the only way we'd be able to conceive
[44:11] and it was prohibitively expensive and
[44:13] so we just laid it before the lord and
[44:14] said i don't know how it'll be but i
[44:16] just have to believe because of what the
[44:18] lord did for me there in the service i
[44:20] have to believe that we're going to have
[44:21] this child and so you know a few months
[44:24] later we were at some meetings down at
[44:25] brother nathan bryant's church and i
[44:27] might have shared a little bit of
[44:28] testimony of those meetings but there
[44:30] was a powerful prayer line
[44:32] on that saturday night brother wayne was
[44:33] speaking and that's when a woman got up
[44:36] and and testified that she had been in
[44:38] brother branham's meetings and in his
[44:39] prayer lines and she said tonight was
[44:41] just exactly the same the same
[44:42] atmosphere the same power and of course
[44:44] it is because it's the same god amen
[44:46] amen but brother brother wayne was
[44:48] preaching on being in position for a
[44:50] miracle and he actually gave the
[44:51] testimony of his son and his daughter uh
[44:54] we're in the exact same situation as as
[44:56] us and my wife and sister ann are very
[44:58] close
[44:58] but the lord allowed them to have a
[45:00] little baby and so you know just faith
[45:02] was being built and it came down to the
[45:04] prayer line and and uh and you know i i
[45:07] i'm believing for for a child but uh
[45:10] but you know not pushing anything
[45:12] because you sisters and your brothers
[45:14] that are married and been through this
[45:15] you understand how traumatic it is to
[45:17] you know to to miscarry to lose a child
[45:19] like that and so so i just said lord
[45:21] whatever it is whatever the timing is
[45:23] you work on my wife and and just work on
[45:25] both ends and it's just laying before
[45:27] the lord that's how you have to do it
[45:28] sometimes say man so
[45:30] so uh so just almost to the end of the
[45:33] prayer line my wife came up to in the
[45:35] prayer line and and i didn't really know
[45:37] what she was going for actually she she
[45:39] went up for something
[45:40] different
[45:41] her side of the testimony is quite
[45:43] amazing as well that she had something
[45:44] different on her heart came up in the
[45:46] testimony but when she got there she
[45:48] just broke down she said we're here we
[45:50] want a child we want a baby and so so we
[45:53] just stood there we had a we had it was
[45:55] you know
[45:56] the spirit of lord just came and and
[45:57] blessed it and uh and then after the
[46:00] service was over i went into the office
[46:01] with brother wayne and the holy spirit
[46:03] came again i just crying and weeping i
[46:05] said i knew this was the day i knew this
[46:07] was the day so we just held it before
[46:09] the lord i don't know when i don't know
[46:11] how but i just know where this is going
[46:13] to be fulfilled and so
[46:14] a few months later it was actually the
[46:17] week before our youth camp uh when we
[46:19] had all that going on
[46:21] she tested positive and so we had a baby
[46:23] of course you know it's hard you've been
[46:25] through this several times you've
[46:26] conceived and lost and conceived and
[46:28] lost you know but we just uh we just
[46:30] we're holding faith and so we got to the
[46:33] eight week appointment and uh everything
[46:35] was just right that's where one of them
[46:37] we hadn't had a heartbeat but so we got
[46:39] to that eight week appointment it was a
[46:41] it was you know as tense and and it was
[46:44] uh suspenseful and uh but the but the
[46:47] the measurement of the baby and the
[46:48] heartbeat of the baby were to the number
[46:50] exactly right exactly right ten weeks
[46:52] exactly right amen and we're we're well
[46:55] on now in the in toward the end of the
[46:57] second trimester i think and and due in
[46:59] april and we've had the gender reveal
[47:01] and it's a lovely little girl amen
[47:05] isn't that the way the lord does us
[47:06] sometimes but but you know what i don't
[47:08] know what that means amen but i know
[47:10] it's a blessing from the lord i know
[47:12] it's a miracle and so i just wanted to
[47:13] give that testimony before we go to the
[47:15] word
[47:17] amen amen might mean we got to have
[47:19] another one
[47:21] get that boy amen but my wouldn't we be
[47:23] content just with what the lord's done
[47:25] for us
[47:26] thus far amen more than we deserve
[47:29] amen but so to turning to this thought
[47:31] on the queen of heaven you know we read
[47:33] the scriptures here of a couple of
[47:35] significant women in the bible and and i
[47:38] think there's actually a a it's a little
[47:40] bit difficult to see without some
[47:42] expounding on it but there's actually a
[47:44] connection i believe between these two
[47:45] scriptures that we've read and between
[47:47] these two stories
[47:48] about the queen of heaven and of course
[47:51] this is an unusual phrase that we don't
[47:52] we don't say it a lot we don't hear it a
[47:54] lot uh uh preached on or spoken of and
[47:58] and actually if you take the phrase
[47:59] queen of heaven and you run that through
[48:01] the bible and search search through the
[48:03] words of the bible you'll find that that
[48:05] it's only spoken in the bible in a
[48:07] negative context there's a lot of quite
[48:09] a few scriptures that mention a queen of
[48:11] heaven but that queen of heaven that
[48:12] it's talking about is a pagan worship
[48:15] of mesopotamian lands where uh and
[48:18] actually the whole book of jeremiah one
[48:20] of the major parts of his ministry is
[48:21] rebuking this worship of the queen of
[48:23] heaven because they made the queen of
[48:25] heaven was was uh uh it was ishtar or
[48:28] astardase it was a a goddess of the
[48:30] eastern religion of the of mesopotamia
[48:32] there and so they had it wasn't just the
[48:35] the real problem with their paganism was
[48:37] not that they had left the worship of
[48:38] god
[48:39] uh but that they had combined the
[48:41] worship of god yahweh the father amen
[48:44] and then they had invented this figure
[48:46] of yahweh's wife or the queen yahweh's
[48:48] queen a man a male god and a female god
[48:52] a god and a goddess and so
[48:54] and and that was uh and that was god you
[48:57] find in the bible will not suffer this
[48:59] god doesn't allow this kind of worship
[49:01] to happen he doesn't he rebukes it very
[49:03] strongly that there's not to be you know
[49:05] because god is not to be worshipped and
[49:07] like you know a male god and a female
[49:09] god god is not two god is not three god
[49:12] is one god he's amen he's one he's one
[49:15] person he's one power he's one spirit
[49:17] he's one one lord and one father of us
[49:19] all uh
[49:20] everything that is all life came from
[49:22] the fountain of the one god the the one
[49:24] true and living god and that is yahweh
[49:26] so there's no duality to god there's no
[49:29] multiplicity to god amen there's only
[49:32] one god amen but we find that there is
[49:35] in this pagan worship there there there
[49:37] they're fascinated with all these
[49:39] different aspects of male and female and
[49:41] things and so and so it turned into a
[49:43] paganism and we know that it didn't stay
[49:45] pagan amen but it crept into the
[49:47] christian religion and we we know the
[49:48] history of the church how these things
[49:50] came into the catholic church early on
[49:52] through roman paganism and that's why
[49:54] today it's actually a pagan thing that
[49:58] the catholics speak about mary the
[49:59] mother of jesus they call her the queen
[50:02] of heaven that's their that's their
[50:04] appellate for her that's her title
[50:06] that's her that's her position in the
[50:08] catholic doctrine that mary is the queen
[50:10] of heaven that jesus is the king and
[50:12] mary is the queen and that's that's
[50:14] their they they call her that now
[50:16] brother branham said some of you dear
[50:17] catholic people he said they met you
[50:19] make her a goddess a queen of heaven but
[50:21] it's not right he said it's it's not she
[50:23] was a good woman yes sir but she was no
[50:26] more than any other woman that god
[50:29] chooses to use amen now can you imagine
[50:32] that now what a teaching amen what a
[50:34] teaching brother bran is bringing she
[50:35] was no more than any other woman that
[50:37] god
[50:38] chooses to use he said he can use a
[50:40] woman for something else now now isn't
[50:42] that amazing because you know of all the
[50:44] women ever born in this world of all the
[50:46] billions of of of women that have lived
[50:50] over the over the eons and the centuries
[50:52] there's only one woman amen who found
[50:54] favor with god only one woman who was
[50:56] elected and chosen amen and put in the
[50:58] in the right season and put in the right
[51:00] city in the right place in the right
[51:02] circumstances there's only one woman who
[51:04] was visited by the angel gabriel only
[51:06] one woman who brought forth from her
[51:08] womb the lord jesus christ amen amen and
[51:11] yet brother branham is teaching you that
[51:13] that woman amen though she was a blessed
[51:15] woman and a favored woman in the economy
[51:17] of god she's no more than any other
[51:19] woman god chooses to use amen now we're
[51:22] foreshadowing something here she's no
[51:24] more than any other woman god chooses to
[51:26] use amen she he said he could she he can
[51:28] use a woman for something else now see
[51:31] but so so god is not allowing anyone to
[51:34] claim this title of queen of heaven it's
[51:36] it's it's it's it's forbidden it's not a
[51:39] a god god is rebuking it he's not
[51:41] allowing it because he's jealous over
[51:43] that title he has never allowed no woman
[51:45] there is no woman there is no church
[51:47] there is no religion there is no system
[51:50] there is no nation there is nobody who
[51:52] has ever been allowed to be called the
[51:53] queen of heaven nobody has a right to
[51:55] that nobody it's been forbidden amen
[51:57] through the ages to any church or woman
[51:59] or people amen this this this uh this
[52:02] this status of the queen of heaven and
[52:04] yet you find that it speaks in the bible
[52:07] of the lamb's bride amen that the lamb
[52:10] would have a bride amen it's spoken of
[52:12] the bible the lamb would have
[52:14] a bride amen and and so you know uh i i
[52:18] just want us to to enter into this now
[52:20] this morning because those of us that
[52:22] have been raised around the message and
[52:23] we're familiar with message teachings
[52:25] you know we we very much take it for
[52:27] granted what we know about the bride of
[52:29] jesus christ but that even that title
[52:31] even that even that that revelation of
[52:34] of the of of the true bride of jesus
[52:36] christ is something that's a mystery to
[52:38] many people it's uh
[52:40] all the different denominations have
[52:41] different ideas about it the mormons
[52:43] believe there's a mother god and a
[52:44] father god and justice pagan as the rest
[52:46] and you know different churches that
[52:48] they they have different ideas about who
[52:50] that bride is amen and yet see we have
[52:53] been identified by a message and we have
[52:55] received a revelation which is allowing
[52:57] us to see something very beautiful here
[52:59] amen amen i got to tell you a funny
[53:01] little story about when i was a little
[53:03] boy i was sitting in church with one of
[53:05] my cousins we were sitting next to
[53:07] grandma you know like you do when you're
[53:08] a little boy maybe six seven eight years
[53:10] old and grandpa was just preaching away
[53:12] and preaching a good sermon on the bride
[53:14] of jesus christ and my little cousin
[53:16] piped up and he said the bride the bride
[53:19] it's always about the bride
[53:21] amen but you know
[53:23] a little child has no understanding but
[53:25] when we become c's in the word we find
[53:27] out it's all about the bride amen this
[53:30] message is all about who you are what
[53:32] you've been called for what you've been
[53:34] positioning a place to do in this world
[53:36] amen there is the lamb's bride and
[53:39] notice what a prophet is going to tell
[53:40] you who that bride is and he's going to
[53:42] identify you and he's talking about here
[53:44] in the first seal about the throne of
[53:46] judgment he says notice the rest of the
[53:48] dead are going to come forth and this is
[53:50] the white throne and they're going to
[53:52] stand before the bride that's right
[53:54] stand before the king
[53:56] and the queen
[53:58] amen glory said there is a church today
[54:01] rebuking the catholics here that calls
[54:02] herself the queen of heaven here's what
[54:04] brother brahm said the queen of heaven
[54:07] is the selected bride of jesus christ
[54:11] and she comes with him friends i didn't
[54:13] make that up i didn't say that about you
[54:16] but vindication amen a god sent message
[54:18] a prophet of our day stood on the face
[54:21] of the earth and has identified you amen
[54:24] not as a lowly servant but as the very
[54:26] queen of heaven the bride of jesus
[54:29] christ amen a royal seed amen one with
[54:33] our king hallelujah and she comes with
[54:35] him friends you say well that's way out
[54:37] of reach brother nathan when you're
[54:39] talking about something that that just
[54:40] doesn't feel comfortable it doesn't
[54:42] strike me right to to to to claim a
[54:45] title like that of the queen of heaven
[54:46] but friends amen it's not out of reach
[54:49] to say it you are the queen of heaven
[54:51] amen vindication has uttered it amen
[54:54] over this bride he said i no longer call
[54:57] you church i call you bride you are the
[55:00] lamb's wife you are the queen of heaven
[55:02] amen you'll judge the world whole
[55:04] friends you say well brother anything
[55:06] but what have we done or or who who who
[55:09] would i be to be called the queen of
[55:10] heaven it is not what you have done it
[55:13] is not what any man or woman has done or
[55:15] who you are amen it is the election of
[55:18] god that let you represent amen
[55:20] recognize the message for your day amen
[55:23] the grace of god that chose you for this
[55:26] amen you didn't ascend to this title but
[55:28] god threw a message amen has laid this
[55:31] title on you amen when he took you to be
[55:34] no longer a church but to be his bride
[55:36] then all of his royalty was transferred
[55:38] to you
[55:39] glory be to god oh brother bran said
[55:42] didn't jesus say the queen of now this
[55:44] is typing this bride he's preaching on
[55:46] this bride he said didn't jesus say the
[55:48] queen of the south shall rise and
[55:50] condemn this generation he's preaching
[55:52] about the queen of sheba amen how the
[55:54] bible says she would come up in the last
[55:56] judgment and that the queen of sheba
[55:57] would stand there and have to rebuke the
[55:59] generation for rejecting the word of god
[56:01] amen and he said and they were blind and
[56:03] they missed him because they were
[56:05] looking for him but he comes so simple
[56:07] they went right over the top of it amen
[56:09] amen oh
[56:11] friends
[56:11] you know what you you know how this
[56:13] message is we're acquainted with this
[56:14] message in its simplicity it's so humble
[56:17] it's so it's so simple until the world
[56:20] has completely missed the word that is
[56:22] stricken you amen and yet some grace has
[56:25] allowed your eyes to be open amen to the
[56:27] glory of this word amen what a what a
[56:30] what a what a work of grace amen how
[56:33] wonderful amen to think that just like
[56:36] solomon amen solomon had a gift of
[56:38] wisdom he's bringing the forth the word
[56:40] amen and people came from everywhere to
[56:42] hear solomon oh yeah they came from the
[56:44] east and west to sit at the feasts and
[56:47] the and to hear the words of wisdom and
[56:49] to see all the splendor of of solomon's
[56:51] palace and solomon's temple and all of
[56:53] his riches and all those things and then
[56:55] they went their way amen they came they
[56:58] saw and they left amen but the queen
[57:00] amen the queen of sheba when she came
[57:03] there was something it wasn't the riches
[57:05] that it wasn't the the wonder though
[57:07] that's not what impressed her but there
[57:09] was something in solomon's words that
[57:11] touch your heart amen hallelujah what
[57:14] was it it was election friends amen
[57:16] because as sure and as certain as god
[57:19] had king solomon in mind he had king
[57:22] solomon's queen in mind hallelujah so he
[57:25] could not exist without her and she
[57:27] would have to receive his word and she
[57:28] would have to be there amen that's a
[57:30] picture of you friends you're that great
[57:33] queen that brother bram said humbled
[57:34] herself and came and accepted the
[57:36] message
[57:37] and she'll stand in the judgment and
[57:38] condemn that generation friends this
[57:41] message came so simple that the world
[57:44] missed but it was a greater than solomon
[57:46] was here jesus christ himself through a
[57:49] ministry is revealing himself to the
[57:50] world and the world rejected it friends
[57:53] but i tell you what greater than sheba
[57:55] is here because the bride of jesus
[57:57] christ is in her ascendancy amen and she
[58:00] has come under the message it's
[58:01] identified her royalty and it has
[58:04] espoused her to the lamb of god
[58:07] glory be to god
[58:09] hallelujah
[58:11] oh there's something about the bride of

[59:06] she was redeemable now isn't that a
[59:08] wonderful word
[59:09] she was redeemable now what made her
[59:12] redeemable brother bram said because she
[59:14] was in god's thinking at the beginning
[59:17] it wasn't her works friend she was a
[59:19] sinner a prostitute she didn't have any
[59:21] reputation she didn't have any wealth
[59:23] she didn't have any honor she had
[59:24] nothing to offer amen but yet jesus
[59:28] didn't come to the pharisees he didn't
[59:30] go to the high priest he went to the
[59:31] well where a thirsty woman was drawing
[59:35] because she was redeemable because he
[59:36] saw her before the foundation of the
[59:38] world
[59:39] amen oh hallelujah amen she was in god's
[59:42] thinking at the beginning so brother

[1:00:19] you didn't join this this chose you
[1:00:21] amen you didn't put your name on the
[1:00:23] book and join the church and shake the
[1:00:25] pastor's hand amen but jesus christ came
[1:00:28] and took whatever human vessel it was
[1:00:30] and uttered the words of life to you and
[1:00:32] it quickened something on the inside
[1:00:33] here set your heart on fire
[1:00:35] and burst a new life in you
[1:00:38] glory be to god what is it it's election
[1:00:41] friends are greater than sheba
[1:00:43] a greater than shiva
[1:00:45] is here oh to think to think of it you
[1:00:48] know that every country every people
[1:00:50] doesn't matter what it was everybody has
[1:00:52] every every group that's ever existed
[1:00:54] has had the same belief that we are the
[1:00:56] people you are you take different
[1:00:58] languages you know and they're words for
[1:01:00] themselves like like german or dutch or
[1:01:03] whatever it is when you take it all the
[1:01:04] way back to the original it just means
[1:01:06] people because everybody sees themselves
[1:01:08] that way we are the people and then
[1:01:11] there's the other people but and then
[1:01:12] there's everyone else but we're the
[1:01:13] people amen now that's that's true if
[1:01:16] it's a nation if it's a church if it's a
[1:01:18] football team it doesn't matter any
[1:01:20] group of human beings will have that
[1:01:21] idea we are the people amen but to think
[1:01:24] of this bride amen has come from the
[1:01:26] east and the west the bible says she's
[1:01:28] of every nation and tongue she's not a
[1:01:30] group she's misfits and outcasts and
[1:01:33] people that were rejected and kicked out
[1:01:35] of churches and amen and persecuted for
[1:01:37] the sake of the word but by the grace of
[1:01:39] god not because of who we are but by the
[1:01:41] grace of god we are the people the
[1:01:44] lamb's bride the queen of heaven
[1:01:46] hallelujah that's not making something
[1:01:48] to yourself
[1:01:50] amen but that's god's grace to you
[1:01:53] and to me
[1:01:54] amen to make us the people hallelujah
[1:01:57] the chosen people it's not our ability
[1:01:59] it's not our amen
[1:02:01] can we take a little example from
[1:02:02] history this morning i'm kind of a
[1:02:04] history buff and i i like to i like to
[1:02:06] think along these lines but the other
[1:02:08] day i was thinking about queen elizabeth
[1:02:10] back in uh back in the
[1:02:12] the early days of the kingdom of england
[1:02:14] and this was just at the time you know
[1:02:16] she was a remarkable figure in history
[1:02:18] actually because she was a she was a
[1:02:20] woman as a small child uh her her family
[1:02:23] was protestant but her she had an aunt
[1:02:25] uh who was catholic who persecuted the
[1:02:27] protestant church in in the in england
[1:02:30] and that that's the one that's called
[1:02:31] bloody mary the queen of scots and so
[1:02:33] her aunt when she was very young locked
[1:02:35] her away in a tower amen it looked like
[1:02:37] looked like she would just spend the
[1:02:39] rest of her life there amen but but
[1:02:41] things just worked around amen until she
[1:02:43] ended up becoming the queen and she
[1:02:45] never actually got she never actually
[1:02:46] got married so at that time for like the
[1:02:49] first time there wasn't a king of
[1:02:50] england it was just the queen there was
[1:02:52] no there was no king there the queen was
[1:02:54] the one that was present she had the
[1:02:55] rulership and so that makes her a
[1:02:57] remarkable figure in history
[1:02:59] and so at that time though there was a
[1:03:01] great turmoil because because uh uh
[1:03:04] because of the uh uh the the wars going
[1:03:07] on between catholics and protestants and
[1:03:08] the greatest empire of the time was the
[1:03:10] spanish empire which was catholic and
[1:03:12] they were so they were
[1:03:14] incredibly rich from american gold and
[1:03:17] and there and so the king of spain is
[1:03:20] sending his armada just that like the
[1:03:22] thousands hundreds of ships the greatest
[1:03:25] ships the world had ever seen the the
[1:03:27] latest technology biggest like the big
[1:03:29] great big they called them floating
[1:03:31] castles with cannons on them and he was
[1:03:33] sending his armada up there to take
[1:03:34] elizabeth off the throne and and and
[1:03:37] bring the inquisition amen to the
[1:03:40] shores of england amen and shut down the
[1:03:42] protestant uh
[1:03:43] movement basically permanently in
[1:03:45] england now now we all know about the
[1:03:48] the british empire you know the famous
[1:03:50] british empire and one of the greatest
[1:03:52] of the imperial age and they had the
[1:03:54] saying that the sun never set on the
[1:03:56] british empire didn't matter where you
[1:03:57] were in the world where the sun was it
[1:03:59] might be night in england but somewhere
[1:04:00] the sun is shining on british soil amen
[1:04:02] but it didn't start like that when it
[1:04:05] started out it was very small it was an
[1:04:06] underdog it didn't have military might
[1:04:09] it didn't even have a stable government
[1:04:10] because all you had was the queen
[1:04:13] and that's where that battle cry came
[1:04:15] from
[1:04:16] god save the queen
[1:04:18] god save the queen amen amen and and you
[1:04:22] know this is what's amazing to me
[1:04:24] because this period of history has been
[1:04:25] very romanticized but there really is
[1:04:28] nothing special nothing that special
[1:04:30] about elizabeth's core about her
[1:04:32] government it had all the same politics
[1:04:34] it had all the same corruption it had
[1:04:37] all the same intrigue and things and
[1:04:38] going around it didn't have a lot of
[1:04:40] wealth it didn't have a lot of power it
[1:04:42] didn't have a lot of anything all it had
[1:04:43] was a queen amen amen and but what made
[1:04:46] the difference there friends amen when
[1:04:48] you think about what makes a difference
[1:04:50] it wasn't any woman
[1:04:52] it wasn't any government it wasn't any
[1:04:54] people but it was this fact amen that
[1:04:57] the light of luther was burning on amen
[1:05:00] in queen elizabeth's dynasty amen they
[1:05:03] are the the kings and queens of that
[1:05:04] dynasty of that lineage were carrying on
[1:05:06] luther's light amen until one day that
[1:05:09] light was going to burn forth on their
[1:05:11] on their soil a wesley who would take
[1:05:14] the message of of sanctification across
[1:05:17] the world and eventually amen that that
[1:05:20] same kingdom that she was ruling over
[1:05:22] amen was going to plant on a new
[1:05:24] continent the seeds of the greatest
[1:05:26] christian revival ever to strike the
[1:05:27] face of the earth amen so oh that's why
[1:05:30] god saved the queen amen amen you know
[1:05:33] that actually at her time she was
[1:05:35] rubbing shoulders with the very same
[1:05:36] scholars who would write the king james
[1:05:39] bible that's why god saved the queen
[1:05:42] amen not because she was a great queen
[1:05:44] amen not because she was a great person
[1:05:46] but because god moves the governments
[1:05:50] and the powers of the earth to protect
[1:05:52] his word and because she was attached to
[1:05:54] his word god saved the queen and so when
[1:05:56] her aunt locked her in a tower amen for
[1:05:59] life god saved the queen amen when
[1:06:01] people tried to depose her because they
[1:06:02] didn't want a woman to be ruling amen
[1:06:05] god saved the queen he had a purpose in
[1:06:07] saving the queen and when that spanish
[1:06:09] armada floated up the english channel to
[1:06:11] bring the inquisition to her shores amen
[1:06:14] she stood there on the shore with her
[1:06:15] people and she said here i am she said
[1:06:17] i've got the she stood before her her
[1:06:20] navy and she said here i am i've got the
[1:06:23] frail body of a woman but i've got the
[1:06:25] heart of a king amen and so and so when
[1:06:28] her navy went forth god saved the queen
[1:06:30] hallelujah and the armada was sunk and
[1:06:33] the british empire began that day and
[1:06:35] you know how god saved the queen is that
[1:06:37] though when those great spanish ships
[1:06:39] came rolling in as i've read somewhere
[1:06:41] amen that her boats were so little amen
[1:06:44] that the span great spanish galleons
[1:06:46] fired right over the top of them
[1:06:48] amen it was all her own humility is what
[1:06:51] saved the queen that's how god saves his
[1:06:53] queen france that's how god saves you
[1:06:56] when you're up against a trial amen when
[1:06:58] your great enemy comes to destroy you
[1:07:00] amen he's great but you're small
[1:07:03] i love you and it's the very greatness
[1:07:05] of the devil that's his undoing
[1:07:07] amen because his world can never
[1:07:09] recognize god's queen
[1:07:12] hallelujah he may hate it he doesn't
[1:07:15] want it he doesn't want this bride to be
[1:07:17] on this earth in the position that she's
[1:07:19] in having the power that she has
[1:07:22] but god saves the queen
[1:07:24] god saves the queen hey man you like
[1:07:26] that
[1:07:27] hallelujah oh we're nothing in the eyes
[1:07:29] of the world but we're carrying a seed
[1:07:31] on the inside and it's because of that
[1:07:33] word seed that's in you not because of
[1:07:35] your merit that you're saved it's
[1:07:36] because you're attached to the word so
[1:07:38] when you deserve death in hell god save
[1:07:41] the queen amen whatever you're going
[1:07:43] through that threatens to destroy your
[1:07:44] very life
[1:07:46] god saves the queen
[1:07:48] because of that
[1:07:49] because of that word
[1:07:50] because of that seed on the inside
[1:07:53] no matter what you're going through i
[1:07:55] say god save the queen amen
[1:07:57] amen see so friends why is it we get so
[1:08:01] worried then about all the waves of this
[1:08:03] world and the warfares and always
[1:08:05] worried
[1:08:06] we there's christians spending all their
[1:08:08] time worried that they're gonna sink
[1:08:09] you're not gonna sing god's gonna save
[1:08:11] you from that storm those waves cannot
[1:08:14] sink you why because not because of you
[1:08:16] or your ability but because there's a
[1:08:18] seed on the inside that god won't let go
[1:08:20] of
[1:08:21] god saves the queen he protects the seed
[1:08:23] so the word can go forth
[1:08:26] hallelujah
[1:08:27] he sure does it then why are we worried
[1:08:29] about trying to make waves in this world
[1:08:32] we're not of this world we're of another
[1:08:34] kingdom we're of another realm
[1:08:36] oh friends i like the way brother graham
[1:08:37] said it in a prisoner might have read it
[1:08:39] here before he's praying he says may we
[1:08:41] remember in our minds as we walk down
[1:08:44] the street and rub arms with the world
[1:08:46] we're not supposed to be like them
[1:08:49] we're not supposed to be like them but
[1:08:51] actually now he said
[1:08:53] now look where where where the prophet's
[1:08:55] placing you amen because people people
[1:08:57] want to take this power and authority
[1:08:59] and try to make some great ministry out
[1:09:01] of it build some big church and
[1:09:03] everybody look at us look away no that's
[1:09:05] not this bride brother ram said the
[1:09:07] bride he said we step aside and give
[1:09:09] them place
[1:09:11] amen he said we in their rightful
[1:09:12] position here on earth we'll take the

[1:09:31] world and and and and and the poverty
[1:09:34] you know the rich people doing whatever
[1:09:35] they do and and hoarding power and
[1:09:38] manipulating things and everybody
[1:09:40] there's so much turmoil in this world
[1:09:41] but for the bride we're not part of all
[1:09:43] that nonsense let them do that's their
[1:09:45] right to play that game to do what they
[1:09:47] want to do whatever they're going to do
[1:09:49] they're going to do but the bride has a
[1:09:51] seated amen she's part of another

[1:10:10] even more than a son you are his spouse
[1:10:13] you are the bride of jesus christ you
[1:10:16] are the queen of heaven
[1:10:18] if you have a kingdom that's coming into
[1:10:20] power you're delegates from another
[1:10:22] world if you're trying to make this
[1:10:23] message into something that'll glorify
[1:10:24] yourself friends you'll never get
[1:10:26] anywhere with it but when you can see it

[1:13:48] is gonna be my god where you die that's
[1:13:51] where i die
[1:13:52] hallelujah why because she is something
[1:13:55] election grace god's foreknowledge is
[1:13:58] driving her to be part of that judah
[1:14:01] line to bring forth the promised son
[1:14:04] amen because she had to be a part of it
[1:14:06] even though she was following a false
[1:14:08] religion amen when when god found her
[1:14:10] she was a moabitus she was a gentile she
[1:14:13] wasn't part of it seemed like not part
[1:14:15] of the promise we would have called her
[1:14:17] a sinner we would have called her
[1:14:19] somebody with no hope amen we would have
[1:14:21] called her somebody of this world who
[1:14:22] would never see this message but god
[1:14:24] turned something around because god
[1:14:26] wanted her to be a part of it and he
[1:14:28] wanted to place a seed in there that
[1:14:30] would bring forth one day the lord jesus
[1:14:32] christ right out of jesse's line
[1:14:34] absolutely friends that's the way it is
[1:14:36] for you and your lord amen
[1:14:39] brother bran said he was the fullness of
[1:14:41] the godhead bodily
[1:14:42] so you walked with him when he was on
[1:14:43] earth
[1:14:44] you suffered with him
[1:14:46] why because you were in that godhead
[1:14:49] so you suffered with him and you died
[1:14:51] with him you were buried with him and
[1:14:53] now you're risen with him and manifested
[1:14:56] attributes of god setting in heavenly

[1:15:28] message preachers teaching and preaching
[1:15:31] and pouring their heart out about how
[1:15:32] you must you must get past the church
[1:15:35] you must be able to see christ in this
[1:15:36] message that's what that means because
[1:15:38] when you see christ then you will see
[1:15:41] yourself amen positionally placed in
[1:15:44] christ amen and then whatever attributes
[1:15:46] you have of this flesh do not pertain to

[1:16:14] see you
[1:16:15] amen because you were a mystery you were
[1:16:18] hidden in him but that ministry had to
[1:16:21] be
[1:16:22] fulfilled
[1:16:23] just like just like just like eve had to
[1:16:26] come forth from adam
[1:16:28] for the mystery to be perfect for

[1:21:13] her
[1:21:14] this wasn't some prosperity gospel
[1:21:16] nonsense
[1:21:17] no but there was an appointed time an
[1:21:20] appointed place
[1:21:21] and an appointed purpose see what are we
[1:21:24] talking about the ministry of the bride
[1:21:25] on earth now
[1:21:27] see what is the ministry of that bride
[1:21:29] brother braham said one in a million i'm
[1:21:30] going to break it down here he said
[1:21:32] brother jesus supposed to according the
[1:21:34] scriptures returned to us in the last
[1:21:35] days
[1:21:36] in this type of ministry
[1:21:38] and that will be after the baptism of
[1:21:40] the spirit after the speaking in tongues
[1:21:43] after the divine healing
[1:21:44] he said what we're speaking of is the
[1:21:46] capping of the pentecostal message
[1:21:49] notice now see it's the capping of the
[1:21:51] pentecostal message he said and what is
[1:21:54] that capping is this ministry of the
[1:21:57] christ himself
[1:21:59] impersonated amongst his people
[1:22:02] amen with the very same things that he
[1:22:04] did when he was here on earth in his
[1:22:06] body the bride friends see it's more
[1:22:10] than just a pentecostal
[1:22:12] it's more than pentecostalism it's more
[1:22:14] than signs and wonders or miracles or
[1:22:16] speaking in tongues or dancing or
[1:22:17] shouting it was more than a tingle that
[1:22:19] went up and down your spine but that
[1:22:21] holy ghost on the inside of you is jesus
[1:22:23] christ himself has taken up residence in
[1:22:26] you to fulfill the same ministry that he
[1:22:28] had when he was on the earth
[1:22:30] before this world
[1:22:32] more than
[1:22:33] not just to make you rich or get you
[1:22:35] inflated cadillac's or a big mansion or
[1:22:37] something like that no to make you one
[1:22:39] with him and to and to carry on and
[1:22:41] reproduce
[1:22:43] amen the ministry of jesus christ
[1:22:45] through your spiritual womb friends amen
[1:22:47] that is the ministry of this bride it's
[1:22:49] christ himself impersonated in the
[1:22:51] people or incarnated in the people amen
[1:22:54] just like when he was on earth now he's
[1:22:56] doing the same things as husband and
[1:22:59] wife or
[1:23:00] king
[1:23:01] and
[1:23:02] queen amen just before the marriage
[1:23:05] ceremony amen see the purpose of the
[1:23:08] bride the ministry of the bride is to
[1:23:10] reproduce the bridegroom that's what
[1:23:13] that's what consummates a marriage that
[1:23:15] is the purpose of the union amen we know
[1:23:17] these things is to reproduce amen the
[1:23:20] bridegroom that is your ministry friends
[1:23:23] just like sarah in the old testament
[1:23:24] amen amen and mary in the new testament
[1:23:27] you have been called to bring forth the
[1:23:30] promised son
[1:23:32] oh now this is very important amen i
[1:23:34] hope you listen very carefully to this
[1:23:36] but you've been you have been called to
[1:23:38] bring forth the promised son well what
[1:23:40] does that mean brother nathan when you
[1:23:41] study the the promised son through the
[1:23:43] message and through the bible i don't
[1:23:45] i'm not going to take the time to go all
[1:23:46] into it this morning amen but but the
[1:23:48] promised son represents the coming of
[1:23:51] the lord it represents his coming amen
[1:23:54] his advent his arrival amen oh just like
[1:23:57] and that's what that's what every the
[1:23:59] the the
[1:24:00] there's a there's an experience that
[1:24:02] unites everyone from the old testament
[1:24:04] to the new up till today we all share
[1:24:07] one experience as god's children and
[1:24:08] that is waiting for the coming waiting
[1:24:11] for the coming abraham and sarah we're
[1:24:14] waiting for the coming israel was
[1:24:16] waiting for the coming simeon and anna
[1:24:18] were waiting for the coming we the
[1:24:20] churches have been waiting for the
[1:24:21] coming but the bride's ministry is to be
[1:24:24] the vessel through which his coming
[1:24:26] happens amen because he could not come
[1:24:29] the promised son couldn't come to
[1:24:31] abraham and sarah except it came through
[1:24:34] abraham's bride and thus
[1:24:36] jesus could not come into this world
[1:24:37] except he came by the womb of mary and
[1:24:40] jesus can't return to this earth unless
[1:24:43] he comes through the bride of jesus
[1:24:44] christ
[1:24:45] brother man said just as sarah's body
[1:24:47] had to be changed to receive the child
[1:24:49] of promise your bodies will have to be
[1:24:51] changed amen before jesus christ can
[1:24:54] come and sit on a throne
[1:24:57] it is your ministry and it is your
[1:24:59] purpose to be the very vessel by which
[1:25:02] amen jesus returns the rapture is not
[1:25:05] something floating around in the sky and
[1:25:07] one day it'll just kind of it'll just
[1:25:09] kind of accidentally randomly happen
[1:25:10] stance strike the earth the rapture
[1:25:12] friends amen is swirling around amen in
[1:25:15] the sacred fire on the altar of your
[1:25:18] heart it's christ in you rapture is in
[1:25:21] you
[1:25:22] the coming of the lord is in you it's
[1:25:23] coming through you
[1:25:25] you are part of it you are one with it
[1:25:28] glory be to god the promised son is a
[1:25:31] type of the coming lord it cannot come
[1:25:32] forth through any other vessel than the
[1:25:35] bride of jesus christ if sarah's body
[1:25:37] had to be changed amen we said that now
[1:25:39] i know see the rapture cannot come
[1:25:42] through any other church or people or
[1:25:44] queen or goddess or religion or idea or
[1:25:47] anything
[1:25:48] than you
[1:25:49] the bride of jesus christ
[1:25:51] i know that's an awesome statement
[1:25:53] amen but god
[1:25:55] is seeking a bride who can receive it
[1:25:57] a bride who can recognize their message
[1:25:59] recognize her day recognize such a time
[1:26:01] as this
[1:26:02] what we're on the earth for you to
[1:26:04] receive that message not just receive
[1:26:06] christ and brother branham but receive
[1:26:08] christ in you
[1:26:11] hallelujah
[1:26:12] amen amen
[1:26:14] you look at sarah amen sarah you know
[1:26:17] she was she was faithful to god's
[1:26:19] prophet
[1:26:21] she was faithful to him she believed him
[1:26:22] she fought him she was married sarah
[1:26:24] called abraham lord
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:28] and we would say that that's the most
[1:26:30] the the most faithful message believer
[1:26:32] that it could be
[1:26:33] but did you ever contrast that to the
[1:26:35] two to the to the new testament because
[1:26:37] sarah called abraham lord
[1:26:39] amen and yet she was rebuked because she
[1:26:43] shirked at the promise it was too great
[1:26:45] it was too wonderful it's too it was too
[1:26:47] incredible for her to believe that she
[1:26:50] could be the one to bring forth the
[1:26:52] promised son of course bret grace
[1:26:53] brought it forth anyway amen but then in
[1:26:56] the new testament when jesus goes to
[1:26:58] find his bride
[1:27:00] amen there came a woman
[1:27:02] amen and said to him uh there's came a
[1:27:04] woman she said i want my child amen her
[1:27:08] child was demon-possessed her child
[1:27:10] ain't meant her child been taken from
[1:27:11] her she said i want that child amen amen
[1:27:14] but jim but she wasn't under a covenant
[1:27:16] she wasn't like uh she wasn't like sarah
[1:27:19] we would say she didn't she wasn't
[1:27:20] raising the message she wasn't around
[1:27:22] she never heard the hunting stories she
[1:27:23] never was part of the church she was
[1:27:25] backslid she didn't grow up in a pew she
[1:27:27] grew up on a bar stool whatever it was
[1:27:30] amen apply it to your own self but when
[1:27:32] she said truth lord amen jesus actually
[1:27:36] called her a dog
[1:27:37] amen but she but but see a little bit of
[1:27:39] resistance couldn't stop her something
[1:27:42] in her heart was driving her to the
[1:27:43] promise that's what he was looking for
[1:27:46] so when she said lord amen brother bran
[1:27:49] said she had a right to him under that
[1:27:51] name why she might not been part of
[1:27:53] abraham's line naturally but she was
[1:27:56] part of abraham's seed amen because she
[1:27:59] was the bride that he was coming for
[1:28:01] glory to god
[1:28:04] that's what i say i say truth lord truth
[1:28:07] lord i may not i may not have problems i
[1:28:10] may in my flesh i may not be redeemed i
[1:28:12] may not i may be a sinful creature and
[1:28:15] yet truth lord but i believe the promise
[1:28:18] i believe there's a crumb for me of this
[1:28:19] bread of life
[1:28:21] i believe i'll bring forth my child
[1:28:24] i believe in restoration
[1:28:26] glory be to god that's what he was
[1:28:28] looking for amen just like jesus when he
[1:28:31] was just like mary when he came to her
[1:28:33] blessed art thou mary and she thought me
[1:28:36] out of all the women in the world
[1:28:39] me
[1:28:40] but be it unto me
[1:28:43] according to thy word i'm so glad mary
[1:28:45] had just enough gumption about her just
[1:28:48] enough audacity to stand in the face of
[1:28:51] an angel telling her she's gonna bring
[1:28:53] forth the messiah and she said all right
[1:28:58] i accept it i don't understand it but i
[1:29:01] receive it
[1:29:02] so be it unto me according to thy word
[1:29:05] here's your handmaid
[1:29:07] you talk about friends talk about how
[1:29:09] the angel came to me brother brandon
[1:29:10] preached that i think i could preach
[1:29:12] about how the angel came to me amen i
[1:29:14] was nothing when he found me amen might
[1:29:16] have been or might have been associated
[1:29:17] with this message my whole life that
[1:29:19] didn't mean i had a clue about this word
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:23] no hope for me nothing good about me
[1:29:25] amen when he found me but he came amen
[1:29:28] and the angel came to me amen i heard
[1:29:31] the words of the angel and it was a
[1:29:33] message to me that in my life jesus
[1:29:36] christ could be brought forth
[1:29:39] and it seems too wonderful to imagine
[1:29:41] that the very rapture amen could come
[1:29:44] through me
[1:29:45] and come through you
[1:29:47] but be it unto me according to thy word
[1:29:50] i didn't say it he did he chose me
[1:29:53] mary wasn't looking for it
[1:29:55] amen

[1:30:08] think it means these starchy churches
[1:30:10] amen it means that there was no human
[1:30:12] intervention amen because she had no
[1:30:15] part to do with it joseph had nothing to
[1:30:17] do with it no man had anything to do
[1:30:19] with it but the holy spirit came and
[1:30:21] overshadowed her and it brought forth in

[1:32:03] but it's true
[1:32:05] it is the word of god
[1:32:07] like the song mary did you know
[1:32:09] hey man little bride did you know could

[1:32:20] day what he would do in your life amen

[1:32:26] his presence amen those revelations that
[1:32:28] would become open to your eyes just
[1:32:30] yours not the worlds but just but just
[1:32:33] as a little elect lady
[1:32:35] here's those love secrets

[1:32:46] spirit and truth converging on the bride
[1:32:48] advent of jesus christ
[1:32:50] the bride coming his life in the body
[1:32:53] preparing us for the change
[1:32:57] amen because when that seed quickens the
[1:32:58] life
[1:32:59] things change
[1:33:00] that's what we're finding out around my
[1:33:02] house everything changes when there's a
[1:33:04] baby on the way when that life is coming
[1:33:06] forth it changes everything appetites
[1:33:08] change behaviors change
[1:33:11] amen moods change anyway
[1:33:14] amen but see
[1:33:16] see
[1:33:16] it's preparing us
[1:33:18] oh church it's time to know where you
[1:33:20] stand with god amen it's time to wreck
[1:33:23] let the bride recognize who she is
[1:33:25] that's when the rapture will go why when
[1:33:27] she sees what is being birthed in her
[1:33:29] own
[1:33:30] heart
[1:33:32] i no longer call you church i call you
[1:33:35] bride amen you're more than a sinner
[1:33:38] you're more than a servant you're even
[1:33:40] more than a son
[1:33:42] you are the bride of jesus christ
[1:33:45] see
[1:33:46] it's a consummation
[1:33:48] amen you've got to understand who you
[1:33:50] are to god what how precious you are to
[1:33:52] him the seed that you're carrying on the
[1:33:54] inside amen is the is this ultimate
[1:33:57] desire to bring forth
[1:33:59] you are his queen
[1:34:01] you are everything to him you know this
[1:34:04] thing talking about you know the natural
[1:34:06] side moods change but really you know
[1:34:07] even physically when a woman is is with
[1:34:10] child you know that sweetness comes over
[1:34:12] her and even the husband his behavior
[1:34:14] changes he becomes he becomes nurturing
[1:34:16] he becomes caring he becomes defensive
[1:34:18] he's protecting what is it is protecting
[1:34:20] that life on the inside amen that's why
[1:34:23] his hand is over you he's overshadowed
[1:34:25] you he said i'll never leave you nor
[1:34:27] forsake you because you've got something
[1:34:29] in the womb of your heart that's
[1:34:30] precious to me and you are precious to
[1:34:33] me because i chose you
[1:34:35] to receive it oh
[1:34:37] what a beautiful relationship what a
[1:34:39] beautiful picture
[1:34:41] amen you've got to understand who you
[1:34:43] are
[1:34:44] you're the queen see because what we
[1:34:47] have
[1:34:48] the problem the main problem one of the
[1:34:50] main problems that we have around the
[1:34:51] message is that this word is so great
[1:34:53] and it's identifying us with such power
[1:34:55] and with such authority but it doesn't
[1:34:56] match you know our sort of human
[1:34:58] experience or our human perspective and
[1:35:00] so we doubt it so much and christians
[1:35:03] struggle with condemnation they they stu
[1:35:05] they struggle with with guilt and shame
[1:35:07] and all these things so much
[1:35:09] amen it's just like esther esther didn't
[1:35:12] want to go before the king
[1:35:14] because she wasn't sure of his love
[1:35:18] she was not sure of her acceptance she
[1:35:20] knew she was a queen but she didn't know
[1:35:22] if she was on that level where she could
[1:35:24] just go into him
[1:35:26] because it was death to do it
[1:35:28] death to enter in
[1:35:30] but she got in the place where
[1:35:33] she found out it was death to stay out
[1:35:35] and so it became a crisis
[1:35:37] it became a time of decision
[1:35:39] amen she began to wonder maybe i'm here
[1:35:41] maybe this is it maybe this is the
[1:35:43] moment and i'm here for such a time as
[1:35:45] this
[1:35:46] but she knew that there was a haman that
[1:35:48] was out to get her her she had an enemy
[1:35:50] and he was very powerful and as far as
[1:35:53] she knew haman's words meant as more to
[1:35:56] the king than hers
[1:35:59] and that was what kept her out of his
[1:36:00] presence
[1:36:02] amen and it's what keeps the christian
[1:36:04] out of the presence of god every time
[1:36:06] amen is a little stumble a little
[1:36:07] mistake and then they doubt in their
[1:36:09] minds whether amen they hold as much
[1:36:12] weight with god as their accuser amen
[1:36:15] amen but and as long as she believed
[1:36:17] that human that haman's accusations
[1:36:19] meant as much to the king as she did she
[1:36:21] would never enter into that presence oh
[1:36:24] friends amen but but haman might have
[1:36:27] been a mighty man he might have been
[1:36:28] powerful but she was his queen amen and
[1:36:32] she had to realize i am the queen amen
[1:36:34] haman's great his accusations are great
[1:36:37] his power is great amen but to think out
[1:36:40] of a million
[1:36:41] girls in the kingdom
[1:36:43] out of all the eligible ladies all the
[1:36:45] talent all the beauty everything in this
[1:36:48] world the king chose
[1:36:50] me the king chose me and it was that
[1:36:54] revelation that took her into her
[1:36:55] presence friends i hope you hear what
[1:36:57] i'm saying until you can receive your
[1:36:59] revelation of justification that it's
[1:37:01] just as though you never did it in the
[1:37:03] first place you are washed you are pure
[1:37:05] you are sanctified amen until you can
[1:37:07] receive your election amen rest on your
[1:37:10] eternal security then how will you ever
[1:37:12] enter before his throne and receive
[1:37:13] power amen receive the scepter for the
[1:37:16] spoken word and the third poll and the
[1:37:18] rapture and all those things that are
[1:37:19] lying there in the hand of the king but
[1:37:21] you don't know that it's extended to you
[1:37:24] because you're afraid to go into his
[1:37:25] presence and find out amen but your
[1:37:27] accuser is nothing to the king
[1:37:30] compared to you because you are his
[1:37:32] queen
[1:37:33] as she found that out didn't he didn't
[1:37:35] she amen because when she went in that
[1:37:37] hour of crisis and she had worked up the
[1:37:40] courage to throw those doors open and
[1:37:42] step up before the king there was a
[1:37:43] whole lot of people that didn't want her
[1:37:45] there amen every sing you ever think
[1:37:47] that every single one of those statesmen
[1:37:49] and and rulers and princes that were in
[1:37:51] that court every single one of them had
[1:37:53] a daughter that he wanted to be the
[1:37:54] queen amen nobody wanted esther there
[1:37:57] all opposition was against her so it is
[1:38:00] for you you come to church on a sunday
[1:38:01] morning amen and the devil's just
[1:38:03] fighting you and bombarding you amen and
[1:38:05] even people getting up in the pulpits
[1:38:07] and trying to and trying to push down on
[1:38:09] the moving the spirit they don't want
[1:38:10] you to feel any emotion they don't want
[1:38:12] the lord the spirit to be able to move
[1:38:13] and touch you and they don't want any
[1:38:15] reality in it at all no power no
[1:38:17] experience no presence
[1:38:19] everything is trying to keep this bride
[1:38:23] out of the presence of the king
[1:38:26] trying to prevent that revelation that
[1:38:27] he is here now
[1:38:30] amen that's what it's all that's where
[1:38:32] the whole battle is
[1:38:34] but this pride has the courage
[1:38:37] you may not see it in yourself but it's
[1:38:39] in there friends and it may take such a
[1:38:41] time as this to for you to for to
[1:38:43] realize your potential
[1:38:45] but you can get past you can break
[1:38:47] through it all
[1:38:48] amen when the spirit comes to move over
[1:38:50] you you can get past what what somebody
[1:38:53] said once when you broke out in worship
[1:38:56] you you you got happy and did a little
[1:38:58] dance somebody criticized it i don't
[1:39:00] know why i'm going this way but you can
[1:39:02] get past that
[1:39:03] because you're the queen
[1:39:05] amen and all the critics in the world
[1:39:07] cannot keep you from your rightful place
[1:39:10] at his side
[1:39:12] haman himself your accuser cannot keep
[1:39:14] you out
[1:39:16] lord be to god so she went in there amen
[1:39:19] and it was and felt all that fear and
[1:39:21] all those all those slant eyes turn on
[1:39:23] her amen looking at her scant amen and
[1:39:26] and and judging her and angry at her and
[1:39:29] she walked up that long aisle to the
[1:39:31] king and maybe she was afraid to even
[1:39:32] look him in the eye but when she saw him
[1:39:36] he was smiling he was holding out a
[1:39:38] scepter because that was his queen
[1:39:41] friends and that's when she found out it
[1:39:43] didn't matter what haman had to say
[1:39:44] didn't matter what the accusers or her
[1:39:46] enemies it didn't matter what any of
[1:39:47] them tried to do she was safe as long as
[1:39:50] she was with that king
[1:39:52] because all the power of his throne was
[1:39:54] behind her all of his favor was on her
[1:39:57] he was for her
[1:39:59] he loved her
[1:40:00] she was his friends and you know the
[1:40:03] last thing uh brother ronnie long was
[1:40:05] sharing this with me but the last thing
[1:40:07] that that esther or the last thing that
[1:40:10] haman saw in his life was esther's face
[1:40:12] when they put that hood over his head
[1:40:14] and hauled him off to the gallows
[1:40:16] friends
[1:40:17] i know you've got an accuser i know that
[1:40:18] devil just wears you out
[1:40:20] as soon as you walk out this building
[1:40:22] right now in this service i'm sure he's
[1:40:24] in your ear saying yeah this is this is
[1:40:26] that's wonderful brother nathan but
[1:40:27] that's for preachers you know and elders
[1:40:29] and that's for this one or that one i
[1:40:31] could never be me what you're preaching
[1:40:33] amen but you know that same accuser amen
[1:40:37] is trying to make you doubt this
[1:40:39] amen one day
[1:40:41] he will stand before a throne of
[1:40:42] judgment
[1:40:43] and the last thing he sees before the
[1:40:45] lake of fire will be your face
[1:40:49] sitting there in the throne with he'll
[1:40:51] look you right in the eye and receive
[1:40:53] his judgment amen and it'll prove once
[1:40:55] and for all where god's favor lies amen
[1:40:58] god's favor is not with the enemy it's
[1:41:00] with his bride it's with his queen and
[1:41:03] she'll rule forever with him

[1:41:39] spoke on that royal seat of abraham how
[1:41:40] that he came and as the bible said he
[1:41:42] possessed all the gates of the enemy
[1:41:45] every gate there wasn't any door left

[1:42:08] he said he cut a hole he cut open again
[1:42:11] he said there's no gates
[1:42:13] it wasn't that he possessed the gates
[1:42:15] and then when he went and then when he
[1:42:16] left you know they closed the gates
[1:42:18] again no he destroyed the gates
[1:42:20] possessed the gates broke down the walls
[1:42:23] brought down the strongholds everything

[1:42:29] said his brother bran said it's not like
[1:42:31] you know you can pray this far and then
[1:42:32] oh hit a gate no he said it's not he
[1:42:35] said they'll close you off like that but
[1:42:37] he said but if our heart condemn us not
[1:42:41] if what does that mean it means if you
[1:42:42] know where you stand with god
[1:42:45] justified
[1:42:47] his bride
[1:42:48] the pure
[1:42:49] sinless spotless bride of jesus christ
[1:42:52] he said
[1:42:53] then then
[1:42:54] then you can possess the gate of every
[1:42:57] enemy you've got
[1:43:00] hallelujah he said anyone who wants to
[1:43:02] now later in the in this message i see
[1:43:04] shall possess the gates of the enemy i'm
[1:43:05] bringing down to a close on this now

[1:43:09] who wants to go in right now
[1:43:11] and who's he talking to he's talking to
[1:43:13] somebody
[1:43:14] who one time they got in the presence of
[1:43:16] god
[1:43:18] and they had a real desire to meet god
[1:43:20] get a real experience really encounter
[1:43:22] god and they but for some reason they
[1:43:25] backed off it might have been the friend
[1:43:26] they were sitting by might have been
[1:43:28] what somebody might think it might have
[1:43:29] been just some condemnation in their
[1:43:31] whatever it was
[1:43:32] they they failed to enter the door
[1:43:36] amen they had their chance and they and
[1:43:39] they and they let it slip
