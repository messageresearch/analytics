[36:03] was praying in the cornfield you really
[36:06] didn't know what to say he didn't know
[36:08] the words to offer up and you know I he
[36:12] just started saying his ABCs and the man
[36:16] that was walking by said what are you
[36:19] doing he said well he says I'm I'm
[36:22] praying he said but all you were doing
[36:24] he said was just saying your ABCs he
[36:27] said yeah he said I I didn't know the
[36:28] words to say so but I figured he could
[36:31] put all the words together you know I
[36:38] thought one time I heard a minister say
[36:42] it like this you know it was a man that
[36:46] a brother who was actually a serving in
[36:51] that in the Moody Bible Institute and he
[36:54] went and I thought it was really
[36:55] remarkable he made a statement he said
[36:56] you know he said he said prayer meetings
[36:59] he said was one of those things he said
[37:00] sometimes he said you'd get people and
[37:02] they get around the altar he said and

[39:29] the the kind of the history the
[39:31] background of this area you know why
[39:32] there's so many Puerto Ricans in this
[39:34] area and stuff like that so it was
[39:37] interesting to me so I love the Hispanic
[39:40] culture because I am one and so once
[39:44] again my name is brother Lewis your ago
[39:45] we reside in in Georgia just about 35
[39:48] minutes outside of Atlanta Atlanta and
[39:51] we bring greetings from brother Samuel
[39:54] Dale my pastor I've been ministering the
[39:57] gospel since 2009 Lord's been been using
[40:02] us by His grace in Nicaragua and
[40:05] Honduras and we've been also being able
[40:08] to minister in in the Philippines a few
[40:10] times mainly youth camps and and and so
[40:15] the Lord and I've also been in doing
[40:16] some interpretation work in different
[40:18] countries so we just want to put our
[40:20] hand you know our shoulder to the wheel
[40:22] wherever God wants to use us amen and so

[40:28] in Nicaragua that you know the brothers
[40:31] down there they say they say brother
[40:32] Luis you know you know you can come down
[40:35] here and preach in any established
[40:37] church you want to but what about those
[40:40] people like in remote areas that have
[40:42] not even heard the name of the Lord
[40:43] Jesus Christ yet and so that's what the
[40:45] Lord is has put on my heart to work with
[40:48] these young brothers young pastors that
[40:50] are down there in the 30s 40s some even
[40:54] in their late 20s and have been put in
[40:56] that position and have such a burden for
[40:58] the people and they go out ten hours
[41:01] away up in the mountains and just deal
[41:04] with Indian tribes up in those areas and
[41:06] so that's where we've been trying to
[41:08] work with the people there in those
[41:10] areas so we certainly covet your prayers

[44:06] did enjoy the heat for a little bit you
[44:08] know in the past weeks and we certainly
[44:10] we certainly have enjoyed that and but
[44:14] it's also remember a prayer meeting as
[44:17] well this coming the Lord willing this
[44:18] coming Tuesday remember that in prayer
[44:21] and the prayer requests was given we've
[44:24] continued to remember Lilliana in prayer
[44:27] and
[44:28] I didn't get a chance I don't know if
[44:31] I'm made mention to you or not but last
[44:34] Friday had the opportunity to take
[44:38] brother cadre up there and we had the
[44:40] opportunity where the cadre had the
[44:42] opportunity to share his testimony as
[44:43] the Lord had led in regarding to God
[44:46] moving on his behalf and healing him of
[44:49] cancer and so he was able to give that
[44:52] testimony there and as well as to pray
[44:55] for for Lilliana so really and then the
[44:59] presence of the Lord was so so great
[45:01] there in the room and we just when we're
[45:06] praying we want to thank God for what
[45:08] he's done that's how we want to pray we
[45:11] want to thank God for what he's done
[45:13] amen so we're just we're looking a men

[45:43] it was a brown recluse that bit her so
[45:46] they asked you know she's they asked her
[45:50] to come back if she was still feeling
[45:52] pain she's been in pain but I believe
[45:54] that worse we are serving the omniscient
[45:58] God it men is omnipresent and he's
[46:01] omnipotent he meant so we just want to
[46:04] even while the words coming forth this

[46:10] the Lord will make a visit there and
[46:12] just touch her and amen just deliver her
[46:15] in her body of the of that affliction
[46:17] amen he's still God he's still the same
[46:21] Amen so we just appreciate each and
[46:23] every one of you different ones that
[46:25] were that we see here and we're just we
[46:28] want to just pull on the gift of God
[46:29] this morning god knows what we have need
[46:32] of and you know in our minds we're not
[46:35] we're not in our minds thinking of of a
[46:39] Jesus that walked the shores of ascended
[46:41] on
[46:42] hi he rose from the grave triumphed over
[46:44] all principalities and he ascended on
[46:47] high and he sent back the Holy Ghost and
[46:49] that same Holy Ghost is the same Lord
[46:52] God that lived in that body called Jesus
[46:55] that is the same Lord Jesus Christ now
[46:59] walking here the same yesterday today
[47:02] and forever and no matter what your are
[47:07] thought and sometimes our senses
[47:09] sometimes as we set in a service
[47:11] sometimes thoughts can come our
[47:14] situations a test or trial or something
[47:16] comes up oh I got to remember to do this
[47:19] or all I got to remember to do this but
[47:21] just remember is that many times there's
[47:24] things sometimes that can come to you
[47:26] like that and it's only to try to
[47:27] distract you and just say Lord I'm here
[47:34] I'm right here Lord Jesus I'm here and
[47:38] he's right here to move he's walking
[47:41] right right through this you say how do
[47:43] you know that because I brought him with
[47:45] me I brought him with me and he and he
[47:49] said in his word wherever two or three
[47:51] are gathered together in my name there
[47:53] am I also in the midst of them amen we
[47:56] are gathered according to the name of
[47:58] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[48:01] this is his promise and we stand upon
[48:03] that and we believe that so if he's the
[48:06] same yesterday today and forever how
[48:07] many say he is then the presence of the
[48:10] Lord then he is here present to heal
[48:13] that which is sick he's here present to
[48:17] deliver that which is bound and he's
[48:19] here to feel and impart his life into
[48:23] those that need life and his life it
[48:27] goes so far beyond anything that we are
[48:30] a person can experience in this life he
[48:32] said I've come that you might have life
[48:34] and that you might have it more
[48:38] amen this is this is the promise of our
[48:41] Lord Jesus this is who's in our midst
[48:43] amen the very life giver himself if
[48:47] there's a promise that you feel like
[48:49] that somehow it seems like it's escaped
[48:51] you or or something and he's here to
[48:54] bring that alive to your life amen he's
[48:57] the life giver to the word Amen so let's

[54:49] okay I'll let you be seated for just a
[54:52] little while and let me just share with
[54:57] you some of the works that we have been
[55:00] doing in the past years and some of
[55:03] these people better
[55:05] Sammo has met
[55:09] these are the new outreaches church
[55:12] outreaches that we're now working with I
[55:16] told you last Thursday about this one
[55:20] island and palawan or we work with 60
[55:24] denominational churches out of the 60 24
[55:28] has come to completely receive the
[55:31] message of the hour and I think that's
[55:34] so wonderful and last year of the Lord
[55:40] opened up more doors in the islands of
[55:45] Cebu Tamar and Mindanao in Mindanao I
[55:52] think it has been 12 years since I last
[55:57] visited the place we started a lot of
[56:00] work in Mindanao but because of my issue
[56:03] my health issue six years ago I just
[56:07] stopped going there you know stopped
[56:10] traveling because it's not easy to
[56:13] travel around the area of Mindanao
[56:15] right now there is martial law in pop
[56:19] imposed and on the whole island and it's
[56:24] kind of difficult to move from one place
[56:27] to another and
[56:30] it's a rough place you know it's a base
[56:34] for a lot of tribes people are still
[56:37] living in Mindanao but after 12 years I
[56:41] came back there and this who visit the
[56:45] brothers and sisters business visit
[56:48] their places were we started churches
[56:52] and I'm thankful to the Lord by His
[56:55] grace
[56:57] they are still continuing on with the
[56:59] with the word without faith the message
[57:02] of the hour and not only that but the
[57:05] churches are going out and winning more
[57:08] souls the Lord starting new churches and
[57:12] I can think of about 200 churches now
[57:15] that are connected to our church and for
[57:21] this I want to give God all the glory
[57:22] and honor I want to share some of this
[57:28] slides with you
[57:33] the new hog treats churches in the
[57:37] pilled Philippine missions here you see
[57:40] new church down in Palawan this is
[57:45] brother
[57:46] Rael our gone and we worked with him is
[57:52] actually tribe tribal leader and he goes
[57:57] where nobody else goes
[58:01] yes he led us to a place I think I
[58:04] mentioned it last Thursday were the only
[58:07] way you can get to the place
[58:10] is to walk for 13 hours there's no other
[58:16] means of transportation you have to
[58:19] track climb up the mountain and cross
[58:24] rivers in order to get to the place and
[58:27] the people are very primitive as you can
[58:30] see this this this brother is now a
[58:34] brother hard we have hardly has clothes
[58:38] on him but better rail led him to the
[58:43] Lord together with people in his tribes
[58:46] and now they started a church in this
[58:48] place
[58:49] and here you see brother al ministering
[58:54] to him and its people about the Word of
[58:57] God
[59:00] yeah this man belonged to the out but
[59:03] all tribe
[59:09] and here's never Church in Purina it's
[59:12] down in Castle Palau in the same Island
[59:15] you know the tribes people
[59:19] there is they're imposing a total log
[59:22] ban in our country but deprives people
[59:26] they are allowed to cut trees and get
[59:30] lumber from the forest they're the only
[59:32] ones that are allowed by our government
[59:34] to do it so this particular group of
[59:39] people here are tribes people and
[59:41] they're able to cut the lumber and all
[59:44] they were asking from us its money to
[59:48] buy nails
[59:50] nails and corrugate us maybe corrugated
[59:55] iron shits you know for the roof so that
[59:58] they can put a roof over the house at
[1:00:03] their building here's a sample of the
[1:00:07] framework that they're doing they're
[1:00:09] building their themselves and here's a
[1:00:15] typical church in Palawan Sand Mountain
[1:00:18] church in c-could Palawan
[1:00:22] you see the dirt floor
[1:00:25] and
[1:00:28] bamboo walls and windows you know they
[1:00:31] don't have glass windows you know it's
[1:00:34] so made of bamboos when the rain comes
[1:00:37] the rain comes into the church you know
[1:00:39] and the floor gets muddied
[1:00:44] but this is the typical Church who we
[1:00:47] work with
[1:00:49] I know at least nine churches that are
[1:00:52] built this way out in the mountains of
[1:00:56] Palawan amongst the tribes people here's
[1:00:59] another tribal church in Catalan
[1:01:04] you see it's that's typical the way the
[1:01:07] church is constructed and here's another
[1:01:12] one
[1:01:12] in she could belong
[1:01:17] and here's one in culligan Santo Nino
[1:01:23] and the church is under repair you see
[1:01:26] the pews that they're using it's
[1:01:29] actually fixed to the ground and the
[1:01:31] wall you know and no padding at all you
[1:01:34] know and you got comfortable pews but
[1:01:39] this is all they got
[1:01:43] counter side views it's a brand new
[1:01:47] church that we started in some ballast
[1:01:49] and we're helping them with cement and
[1:01:53] buy some sand but they they produce
[1:01:56] their own concrete concrete blocks these
[1:02:02] are first concrete blocks that are being
[1:02:04] fabricated and we help them with rebars
[1:02:07] steel bars
[1:02:11] and these are more blocks that they made
[1:02:14] and here's another typical church and
[1:02:17] this is down in Mindanao which we helped
[1:02:20] in the past and we had a service there
[1:02:25] and the Lord just visit us visited us he
[1:02:29] came down in a wonderful way this is a
[1:02:32] church in a beautiful island called
[1:02:34] Chagall there God has become famous now
[1:02:39] it's a resort island because people come
[1:02:45] from all over the world to go surfing on
[1:02:48] this island because the waves on this
[1:02:51] island that they say it's comparable to
[1:02:53] the ones in Hawaii so a lot of people
[1:02:57] they come to this island now Houston has
[1:03:04] a tribal church in cando Agra allowing
[1:03:07] see it's very typical bamboo sightings
[1:03:12] and we help them with concrete blocks as
[1:03:18] you can see the other the back wall is
[1:03:21] made up of concrete blocks in dirt floor
[1:03:27] but
[1:03:30] little by little they they're trying to
[1:03:33] improve the church building maybe put
[1:03:39] concrete on the dirt floor and put some
[1:03:42] windows and doors
[1:03:45] but that they just do the best that they
[1:03:49] can but they love the Lord you know and
[1:03:53] this is the church now that brother Sam
[1:03:58] helped me when they helped me with this
[1:04:01] church with this boat I should say it's
[1:04:05] a it's a big boss of 50 foot long both
[1:04:10] longer than this sanctuary here and
[1:04:14] they're now using it
[1:04:18] number one for livelihood you know so
[1:04:21] they can make some money because it's
[1:04:25] allowance a fishing community and it's
[1:04:28] an island made up of 300 little islands
[1:04:33] you know there are 300 little islands in
[1:04:36] the area surrounding the main island and
[1:04:40] there are people that live there and
[1:04:43] their brothers in Palau they tried their
[1:04:47] best to go to each eye it's of this
[1:04:49] island and being the Word of God to them
[1:04:52] though we called it the mission book how
[1:04:57] mission boug how is our word for blue
[1:05:02] now we have the blue mission before we
[1:05:06] started a green mission we call it the
[1:05:09] bloom TM mission when TM is a word for
[1:05:13] green it's the rubber plantation that we
[1:05:17] start that I think I told you about it
[1:05:19] and now the rubber trees are about this
[1:05:22] big we're old and in in another P years
[1:05:26] time we'll be able to harvest sap from
[1:05:28] them and be able to generate funds to
[1:05:33] support the mission work in the
[1:05:35] Philippines one rubber tree will produce
[1:05:39] $4 a month
[1:05:41] and we planted 5,000 rubber trees on
[1:05:44] this island
[1:05:46] and because of the extended rises and
[1:05:51] some of the robber trees died and got
[1:05:54] stunted but we still have at least 3000
[1:05:57] rubber trees that are living and growing
[1:05:59] and so we just want to thank the Lord by
[1:06:04] the grace of God missionary work will be
[1:06:06] supported just from the rubber farm amen
[1:06:09] thank you so much thank you so much for
[1:06:12] supporting us
[1:06:15] thank you lord
[1:06:34] and now we go to the word
[1:06:45] I ask you to please stand with me
[1:07:03] I'm gonna talk about you as God's T
[1:07:07] words of grace we are stewards of God's
[1:07:13] grace the Bride of Christ is
[1:07:17] I'm gonna talk to you about the
[1:07:19] unlimited mercy of the infinite crystal
[1:07:26] there's a limited mercy limitless it's
[1:07:32] no way you can exhaust it
[1:07:39] is the kind of grace that our priest
[1:07:42] bestowed upon our lives hallelujah
[1:07:52] if you can read with me Jeremiah chapter
[1:07:54] 31
[1:07:57] verse 31 to 34 the fonts are feels small
[1:08:03] I'm sorry about that but you can read it
[1:08:06] from your Bible it says here
[1:08:11] this is God's covenant to Israel behold
[1:08:15] the days come said the Lord and I will
[1:08:20] make a new covenant
[1:08:23] with the house of Israel
[1:08:27] and with the house of Judah
[1:08:30] not according to the Covenant that I
[1:08:33] made with their fathers in the day that
[1:08:36] I took them by the hand to bring bring
[1:08:38] them out of the land of Egypt which my
[1:08:41] covenant they break although I was a
[1:08:46] husband unto them
[1:08:49] see God was a husband and to them but
[1:08:52] they broke their covenant said the Lord
[1:08:55] verse 33 but this shall be the Covenant
[1:09:01] that I will make with the house of
[1:09:02] Israel after those days said the Lord I
[1:09:06] will put my law in their inward parts
[1:09:10] and write it in their hearts and I will
[1:09:14] be their God and they shall be my people
[1:09:17] and they shall teach no more every man
[1:09:21] his neighbour and every man his brother
[1:09:23] saying know the Lord
[1:09:28] for they shall know they shall all know
[1:09:30] me from the least to them of them unto
[1:09:35] the greatest of them said the Lord for I
[1:09:38] will give I will forgive their iniquity
[1:09:42] and I will remember their sins no more
[1:09:50] I'll take you to another portion with
[1:09:53] scriptures in the book of Matthew
[1:09:57] chapter 18 verse 21 to 22
[1:10:08] and then Peter came to him and said Lord
[1:10:12] how oft shall my brother sin against me
[1:10:16] and I forgave him till seven times we've
[1:10:20] read this last Thursday and Peter
[1:10:23] thought it was plenty seven seven seven
[1:10:26] times a day would be plenty but jesus
[1:10:29] said unto him I say unto thee until
[1:10:31] seven times
[1:10:36] I say not unto thee until seven times
[1:10:38] but until seventy times seven
[1:10:44] this reminds us of the Covenant of God
[1:10:47] with Israel
[1:10:50] who seventy weeks were given as a
[1:10:54] covenant of God to Israel
[1:10:58] and that is seventy times seven we're
[1:11:05] not we're not just talking about the
[1:11:08] numbers here you know but seven barbam
[1:11:13] success is a number of completion
[1:11:17] seventy times seven is complete
[1:11:21] forgiveness this is the number of grace
[1:11:27] hallelujah and in first Peter chapter
[1:11:32] four verse eight or our last reading
[1:11:38] just here and above all things
[1:11:43] have fervent charity amongst yourselves
[1:11:48] or charity covers shall cover the
[1:11:53] multitude of sins these are the words of
[1:11:57] God let's pray Heavenly Father we come
[1:12:01] humbly before your feet and once again
[1:12:04] asked that you come and quicken this
[1:12:08] words to our hearts and mind and let us
[1:12:12] fill your press and let us know that you
[1:12:15] are here that you are concerned about us
[1:12:18] and that you're still the same yesterday
[1:12:21] today and you'll never change forever
[1:12:24] Allah know your Stier you're still our
[1:12:27] healer
[1:12:28] you're still our the forgiver of sins
[1:12:32] o God you're still our son keep our
[1:12:34] Sanctifier and you are still able to
[1:12:37] baptize it's one of us with your Holy
[1:12:39] Spirit hallelujah
[1:12:42] father I ask that you meet every need of
[1:12:45] the Saints this morning
[1:12:49] and I asked that you give us a good time
[1:12:52] in the presence of the Lord and around
[1:12:56] your word give you the praise and honor
[1:12:59] and glory in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:13:02] pray I'm in may be seated
[1:13:08] hallelujah
[1:13:12] I just love to talk about the grace of
[1:13:14] God I think it's so important that
[1:13:20] barber dedicated a whole sermon
[1:13:24] - grace because it the message of grace
[1:13:39] this is the message of the New Testament
[1:13:43] and st. Paul calls it a better testament
[1:13:49] you know better than the old and the
[1:13:54] louia because in the Old Testament God
[1:13:59] gave His Word
[1:14:02] and they expected the people to do their
[1:14:06] part of the Covenant and that this obey
[1:14:09] his word and Bertram says God is always
[1:14:14] faithful to do his part in in every
[1:14:18] covenant every time he makes a covenant
[1:14:20] with man God fulfills his part but man
[1:14:25] always fails fulfill his part
[1:14:29] and so there was a need to change it
[1:14:32] there was a need for God to make a new
[1:14:35] covenant and we just read it the
[1:14:38] Covenant the New Covenant of God with
[1:14:40] Israel and we understand that we are the
[1:14:44] spiritual Israel and we are now under
[1:14:48] the this new covenant where God said I
[1:14:52] will put I rewrite my words in their
[1:14:55] hearts Alleluia this now is the new
[1:14:58] covenant in case you still don't
[1:15:01] understand it to put it simply God says
[1:15:04] I will now pour my spirit so that my
[1:15:07] spirit will be living in you so that you
[1:15:12] will not obey my words by your own might
[1:15:19] or human capacity but it's my spirit the
[1:15:23] power of my Holy Spirit will abide in
[1:15:27] you so that my spirit will actually obey
[1:15:30] my own word because you fail I give you
[1:15:39] my spirit so that my spirit can obey my
[1:15:43] own word my spirit in you can obey my
[1:15:46] own word I don't have to trust in your
[1:15:53] humanity to do it because I've tried it
[1:15:58] and you fail miserably now I'm gonna put
[1:16:02] my spirit in you and my spirit will
[1:16:04] fulfill the word and in the end I give
[1:16:09] you the reward I think that's a better
[1:16:12] covenant and that's a covenant of grace
[1:16:22] hallelujah in the book of Matthew other
[1:16:26] Brenna must know Jesus was telling about
[1:16:29] this horrible
[1:16:34] of a king and one of his subjects owed
[1:16:39] him an immense debt let me just read it
[1:16:42] Matthew 18
[1:16:44] verse 35 23 to 25
[1:16:52] therefore is the kingdom of God of
[1:16:55] heaven likened unto a certain King which
[1:17:00] would take account of his servants
[1:17:04] and when he had begun to recon one was
[1:17:08] brought unto Him which owed him think no
[1:17:13] 10,000 talents
[1:17:16] No in case you don't know how much that
[1:17:21] cost we'll talk about it but for as much
[1:17:25] as he had not to pay it was such an
[1:17:28] immense debt that the Bible said he had
[1:17:32] not to pay there's no way you could pay
[1:17:36] the debt his LORD commanded him to be
[1:17:40] sold and his wife and his children and
[1:17:44] all that he had and payment to be made
[1:17:48] mine what a dilemma huh and I think
[1:17:53] about the ten thousand talents how much
[1:17:56] it would cost today one denarii is
[1:18:01] equivalent to one day's wage
[1:18:05] and one talent is about 6,000 denarii
[1:18:13] so one day's wage is one Denari so
[1:18:19] 10,000 times 6000 is about sixty million
[1:18:22] days sixty million days worth of labor
[1:18:28] that's how much this man owes his Lord
[1:18:33] hallelujah
[1:18:34] and I made some calculations and just
[1:18:38] say this man makes about a hundred
[1:18:42] dollars a day and this would mean he
[1:18:47] would have worked 166 thousand years of
[1:18:51] labor
[1:18:54] times $100 a day that 16 million dollars
[1:18:59] this man old his Lord I'm a for man to
[1:19:04] be making $100 a day in owing his
[1:19:09] employer 16 million dollars
[1:19:15] it's just unthinkable there's just no
[1:19:18] way this man will be able to pay this
[1:19:21] debt hallelujah
[1:19:26] and I think of our insurmountable sins
[1:19:30] sorry for the types very small our
[1:19:36] insurmountable sins against God think
[1:19:40] about it
[1:19:44] Romans chapter 3 verse 22 you're
[1:19:46] familiar with this verse for all have
[1:19:49] sinned I have includes you and me every
[1:19:55] preacher in this room every mother you
[1:19:59] know every young person in this
[1:20:02] congregation all have seen including
[1:20:04] better Branham all have sinned and come
[1:20:08] short of the glory of God
[1:20:12] think about it my mom says to sin is to
[1:20:15] miss the mark and my other definition
[1:20:21] for that is the sin is to fall short
[1:20:25] when you miss the mark you actually fall
[1:20:27] short
[1:20:29] alleluiah worry is falling short of
[1:20:33] faith
[1:20:35] is that true you fall short of faith
[1:20:39] when you worry and Fred you worry about
[1:20:45] the bills you worry about the trade wars
[1:20:50] taking place right now you worry about
[1:20:53] you know wars and rumors of wars you
[1:20:57] worry about the hurricane worry about a
[1:21:00] lot of things but see if you worry
[1:21:05] it shows that there is
[1:21:08] you fall short of faith
[1:21:11] and impatience is falling short of
[1:21:15] kindness
[1:21:18] you'll be
[1:21:24] and having a critical spirit is spawning
[1:21:26] short of love
[1:21:32] and being dilatory burbank also used to
[1:21:37] word dilatory i didn't know what the
[1:21:39] mean dilatory
[1:21:42] as laziness is falling short of zeal
[1:21:47] it's when you lose your zeal for doing
[1:21:51] things for serving the Lord your zeal to
[1:21:53] pray to help others to witness to people
[1:21:56] you fall short of that you become
[1:21:59] dilatory
[1:22:01] I'll do it
[1:22:04] being judgmental is falling short of
[1:22:07] grace
[1:22:14] failing to come to church is failing to
[1:22:17] give him praise and gratitude that he
[1:22:20] deserves we fall short we all for sure
[1:22:27] before the Bible says all have sinned
[1:22:30] and come short of the glory of God
[1:22:33] how often
[1:22:36] how often do you fall short have you
[1:22:38] ever thought
[1:22:44] would ten times an hour be a big number
[1:22:56] no it won't be
[1:22:58] let's just say 10 times an hour you fall
[1:23:01] short you commit a sin against God
[1:23:04] 10 times times an hour you multiply that
[1:23:07] with 16 waking hours 365 days in a year
[1:23:13] for average lifespan of 74 years
[1:23:17] you will have committed 4,300,000 sins
[1:23:23] in your own lifetime
[1:23:28] we ever thought of that
[1:23:33] it's insurmountable it's just incredible
[1:23:41] how much he falls short of the glory of
[1:23:44] God hallelujah Saint John chapter 1
[1:23:48] verse 8 to 10 says if we say that we
[1:23:53] have no sin then we deceive ourselves
[1:24:01] you think you're in the message
[1:24:07] you don't commit sin anymore let me tell
[1:24:10] you you're deceiving yourself
[1:24:14] Alleluia if we say we have no sin we
[1:24:17] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[1:24:20] in us so
[1:24:30] the truth is not in us but if we confess
[1:24:34] our sins if we confess our sins
[1:24:41] and he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:24:43] us of all our sins and to cleanse us
[1:24:47] from all unrighteousness if we say we
[1:24:52] have not sinned then we make him a liar
[1:24:55] and God is not a liar
[1:25:03] he said the truth we all have come short
[1:25:06] of the glory of God
[1:25:07] we all have sinned hallelujah even after
[1:25:12] our conversion we still sin we still
[1:25:16] commit mistakes but when Cossack
[1:25:18] mistakes it's actually sinning when you
[1:25:23] fall short you're actually sitting
[1:25:25] hallelujah and you need to do and all
[1:25:28] you need to do is to be faithful be
[1:25:32] humble to admit that you are a sinner
[1:25:35] and that you commit sins every day Paul
[1:25:42] said I backslide every day hallelujah
[1:25:49] you see we only deceive ourselves if we
[1:25:52] if we think we're not sinning and we not
[1:25:57] only deceive ourselves but we are trying
[1:25:59] to deceive God
[1:26:02] we think we can deceive God
[1:26:08] the most powerful deception to me is
[1:26:12] self-deception but thank God for the
[1:26:19] power of the gospel you know brother
[1:26:24] Branham said this the Hebrew serious he
[1:26:27] said this I have no holiness to present
[1:26:31] to him let him said this he has no
[1:26:35] holiness and we think we're holy we
[1:26:42] tried to dress holy we tried to act
[1:26:44] holding and you know talk holy
[1:26:48] hallelujah but better one said I have no
[1:26:51] holiness to present to him
[1:26:54] but I am trusting in his Oh His grace
[1:27:01] and I have I have it in my heart I have
[1:27:07] unmerited it oh my goodness
[1:27:11] grace is unmerited favor
[1:27:17] hallelujah the way I explained it back
[1:27:20] back in the Philippines you know were
[1:27:22] simple minded people
[1:27:25] I say when you throw our rap on your
[1:27:29] neighbor's house and you broke the
[1:27:31] window of your neighbor and your
[1:27:35] neighbor comes to you with a plate with
[1:27:41] a tray of cake
[1:27:43] this gives you a cake you broke his
[1:27:47] window but it gives you a cake that's
[1:27:53] grace
[1:27:55] you don't merit it you deserve to be
[1:28:00] penalized you deserve to be taken to
[1:28:05] court and you know and pay for your tour
[1:28:08] the damage that you've cost colony but
[1:28:11] instead your neighbor bought you a tray
[1:28:14] of cake oh my
[1:28:18] that's unmerited favor hallelujah and we
[1:28:25] don't deserve anything good from God we
[1:28:28] don't deserve it
[1:28:30] Alleluia but God saved us anyway
[1:28:38] God died for us anyway he offered the
[1:28:41] supreme sacrifice so that we can all be
[1:28:44] redeemed and we can all enjoy eternal
[1:28:48] life hallelujah
[1:28:50] said I I have unmerited it I did not
[1:28:55] deserve it
[1:28:56] there is nothing I could do to deserve
[1:28:59] it but by grace he called me and invited
[1:29:03] me to come
[1:29:06] and I look to him and he took the desire
[1:29:10] away from me and bredrin said I make
[1:29:13] thousands of mistakes in each month
[1:29:19] mother Brennan was so humbled to admit
[1:29:22] that he makes thousands of mistake in
[1:29:25] age smart
[1:29:27] how many do you do you make
[1:29:33] but Ruben was honest in saying I make
[1:29:36] thousands of mistakes in each month it
[1:29:39] says in each year sure I do
[1:29:44] but here's the thing when I see I'm
[1:29:47] wrong I say god I didn't mean to do it
[1:29:51] you know my heart I didn't mean to do
[1:29:55] that
[1:29:55] I was just trapped into that and I
[1:29:58] didn't mean to do it
[1:29:59] forgive me Lord hallelujah amen I
[1:30:06] believe this should be our attitude we
[1:30:11] should be always be willing to admit
[1:30:16] Amen that we are frail people amen you
[1:30:22] know we're human beings made of flesh
[1:30:24] and blood and we fail it's time you know

[1:30:33] month every year hallelujah
[1:30:40] and ask for the Lord's forgiveness ask
[1:30:46] for grace we are serving a gracious God

[1:31:24] Romans chapter 3 verse 24 to 26 says
[1:31:29] being justified freely by His grace
[1:31:34] through the redemption that is in Christ
[1:31:37] Jesus
[1:31:41] when God whom God had set forth to be a
[1:31:45] propitiation through faith in his blood
[1:31:49] to declare his righteousness for the
[1:31:53] remission of sins that are past through
[1:31:56] the forbearance of God to declare I say
[1:32:00] at this time his righteousness that he
[1:32:03] might be just and the justifier of him
[1:32:06] which believe in Jesus oh my
[1:32:11] how many believes in Jesus I declare
[1:32:17] unto you he's just is his righteousness
[1:32:21] right now and that he's the justifier of
[1:32:25] everyone that believes in Jesus oh my
[1:32:30] hallelujah we talk of the steps of grace
[1:32:34] but a man calls it the three steps of
[1:32:36] grace justification sanctification
[1:32:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost barbam says
[1:32:43] that makes the that makes up the new
[1:32:46] birth didn't say that well if you think
[1:32:52] about it these are steps of grace these
[1:32:57] are not your steps these are works of
[1:33:03] God in your life

[1:33:12] by faith faith is a revelation we talked
[1:33:18] about it last Thursday you cannot work
[1:33:21] your way into faith because faith it's a
[1:33:27] free gift faith is a gift of God and
[1:33:33] what did but one said faith is a
[1:33:35] revelation you know it's a powerful
[1:33:39] statement you know I talked to I talked
[1:33:41] to a lot of ministers theologians have
[1:33:45] been in Bible school for 10 years some
[1:33:48] are thirty years but when I say this
[1:33:51] profound statement faith is a revelation
[1:33:56] Alleluia
[1:34:00] they think it's so deep it's so profound
[1:34:07] Alleluia
[1:34:08] they never heard it in Bible School
[1:34:13] but the seventh-grade that said it faith
[1:34:16] is a revelation halibut and it's a free
[1:34:26] gift of God to you you did not merit it
[1:34:31] there's nothing you did to deserve it
[1:34:34] God gave it to you freely al aliy if
[1:34:38] your name's in the book
[1:34:39] hallelujah it's made available for you
[1:34:43] it's yours Alleluia and how are you
[1:34:49] sanctified we're sanctified by the blood
[1:34:52] of Jesus not by your own blood not by
[1:34:58] your own works is by the blood of Jesus
[1:35:03] hallelujah were sanctified by the word I
[1:35:07] shall listen to the word
[1:35:11] amen your life will become clean
[1:35:15] hallelujah Bertram says it this way you
[1:35:19] become the word as she received the word
[1:35:22] oh my thank God for Church here is where
[1:35:32] we receive the word by faith how do you
[1:35:37] receive it by faith and that's how your
[1:35:41] life is being sanctified hallelujah for
[1:35:46] some this happens immediately
[1:35:51] for some I know some Christians it's a
[1:35:55] total 100 degree change in lifestyle
[1:36:02] some somebody said
[1:36:04] 360 degrees now if you turn 360 degrees
[1:36:08] you're back to the same way it's a
[1:36:15] hundred eighty degrees Alleluia
[1:36:21] so everything about you change
[1:36:24] hallelujah any man be in Christ he is a
[1:36:27] new creature old things are passed away
[1:36:32] behold all things are become new and how
[1:36:36] are you baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:36:39] how are you sealed into the body of
[1:36:41] Christ
[1:36:42] again it's the work of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:46] it's not the work of the preacher no we
[1:36:52] fail if we think that because the
[1:36:56] ministry is strict the pastor preaches
[1:36:59] so hard and we're so strict in imposing
[1:37:04] church conduct order and doctrine
[1:37:07] imposing holiness upon the people
[1:37:12] that the people will become the church
[1:37:14] will become better
[1:37:15] it's not the work of any particular man
[1:37:19] three steps of grace remember that
[1:37:23] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:37:26] Holy Ghost God does all this hallelujah
[1:37:31] [Applause]
[1:37:39] I caught a part of this statements
[1:37:43] because I wanted to tell you how that
[1:37:45] better been him at one time wanted to he
[1:37:49] was he was condemning an old woman you
[1:37:53] know because he was carousing with two
[1:37:58] policemen you know in a bar I think it
[1:38:01] happened in Ohio
[1:38:02] somewhere in Ohio he said some Roadhouse
[1:38:06] a restaurant and he saw this this woman
[1:38:10] drinking wine with his two political
[1:38:15] policemen and he addressed he described
[1:38:18] it this way and then he said then he she
[1:38:21] had her painted her hair painted blue
[1:38:25] you think blue hair is new but this blue
[1:38:30] hair was careful but where was here said
[1:38:36] she painted her hair blue and I thought
[1:38:40] oh my look here look there and the two
[1:38:44] old drunk men sitting there in
[1:38:46] summertime one of them with a big cover
[1:38:49] o'the overcoat on and an old army
[1:38:52] overcoat and a rag wrap around his neck
[1:38:54] for a scarf and they were so drunk
[1:38:56] sitting there with his old lady
[1:38:59] and bertram said let me just get out of
[1:39:01] this dump he was he was condemning the
[1:39:05] lady and then God showed him the vision
[1:39:08] right you remember of the world turning
[1:39:11] and there was a rainbow about the globe
[1:39:14] and and that rainbow was actually the
[1:39:18] speaker blood which was the blood of
[1:39:20] Jesus that serves as a bumper of mine I
[1:39:23] thank God for that bumper our sins our
[1:39:29] sins cannot go through that bumper if
[1:39:33] you're a believer today our sins cannot
[1:39:36] go through that bumper hallelujah and
[1:39:41] Bertrand saw the face of Jesus and how
[1:39:45] that he was suffering every time he
[1:39:47] committed sin
[1:39:49] and he couldn't believe that he was
[1:39:52] doing it to Christ
[1:39:55] Christ was grimacing and it was in pain
[1:39:58] every time he committed something wrong
[1:40:01] hallelujah and better I'm said Emma am I
[1:40:06] doing that to you Lord not my scene
[1:40:09] hurting you and then he saw a book
[1:40:13] sitting there with his name William
[1:40:15] Brennan and all his sins listed below
[1:40:19] underneath his name all the sins that
[1:40:22] there's committed
[1:40:24] and Christ just took his finger to his
[1:40:28] side
[1:40:30] and with the blood that came out of it
[1:40:33] wrote on top of that book
[1:40:35] pardon Oh hallelujah
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:44] God was saying to Bella banner here I
[1:40:47] have forgiven you I have pardoned you
[1:40:49] and you are condemning this woman
[1:41:00] to speak something to us it's because of
[1:41:04] God's grace that we received forgiveness
[1:41:08] that we have been accepted into the
[1:41:11] kingdom of God hallelujah but after
[1:41:15] we've been accepted into the kingdom of
[1:41:17] God and our lives have changed they have
[1:41:19] become righteous we have become holy
[1:41:21] hallelujah and then we start looking at
[1:41:24] other people who are sinning
[1:41:29] and we begin looking down on them
[1:41:33] no different from but better random did
[1:41:36] Alleluia but you see God wrote across
[1:41:41] your name pardon with his own blood he
[1:41:50] forgave you how dare you condemn others
[1:41:58] when Rama said
[1:42:02] I do not understand how a man can
[1:42:05] condemn a sinner a fellow sinner under
[1:42:07] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:42:10] you can never condemn another person
[1:42:13] able to dispense this grace - I am known
[1:42:16] in my country
[1:42:19] to be a pastor that always wants to
[1:42:22] preach grace under well all the preaches
[1:42:27] about this grace
[1:42:35] they call me mr. grace
[1:42:46] the message of grace Birnbaum said this
[1:42:49] then why could anyone criticize and say
[1:42:53] that grace is wrong
[1:42:57] that we are saved by works
[1:43:01] no we are saved by grace that through
[1:43:05] faith not by works works show that you
[1:43:10] have been saved but what saves you is
[1:43:14] the grace of God grace saves you grace
[1:43:20] it was is what God does for you works
[1:43:24] it's what is what you do for God to show
[1:43:27] appreciation of what God did for you by
[1:43:31] grace you are saved hallelujah
[1:43:35] and here's a very balanced way of
[1:43:39] presenting it hallelujah I was talking
[1:43:45] about assemble and he agreed with me
[1:43:48] when I said I'm finding that a lot of
[1:43:52] message churches and message believers
[1:43:54] are come they lean towards more towards
[1:43:58] on Arminianism
[1:44:01] they want to work their way into heaven
[1:44:05] hallelujah
[1:44:08] to the point of rejecting the grace of
[1:44:13] God Alleluia
[1:44:16] I think of the people of Israel but Aram
[1:44:20] says it's grace that gave them a prophet
[1:44:24] grace gave them a message grace brought
[1:44:29] them a pillar of fire grace brought them
[1:44:32] to the promised land and they wanted law
[1:44:39] they wanted priests to tell them what to
[1:44:42] do hallelujah in effect when the when
[1:44:49] grace was made into flesh and Jesus came
[1:44:53] on the scene they ultimately rejected
[1:44:56] Jesus hallelujah
[1:45:01] they wanted law they wanted to stay in
[1:45:05] the Old Covenant and rejected Jesus
[1:45:11] Birnbaum says just like a marriage
[1:45:17] grace is it's like this Hebrews chapter
[1:45:22] 6 he said
[1:45:26] accepting meat abroad
[1:45:29] as my wife
[1:45:32] was what love done for her
[1:45:37] what she does in appreciation she's a
[1:45:40] nice woman she stays home and takes care
[1:45:44] of our children and lives leaves a good
[1:45:47] true life that's not because we're not
[1:45:49] married
[1:45:52] we are married but she does that in
[1:45:56] appreciation if she runs downtown every
[1:46:01] day and took in every 10-cent store and
[1:46:05] up and down the streets and never was a
[1:46:08] dishes or anything else we are still
[1:46:11] married
[1:46:15] think about it
[1:46:17] hallelujah
[1:46:21] what sister meter does or does not do
[1:46:24] does not have one thing to do with the
[1:46:28] fact that she's married to William
[1:46:31] Brennan because Hillenbrand
[1:46:34] already made the decision to accept her
[1:46:37] as his wife
[1:46:40] so Bertram said even if he runs down to
[1:46:43] town every day and took in every ten to
[1:46:45] ten cents store up and down the streets
[1:46:48] and never wash the dishes never cleaned
[1:46:50] a hole or anything else we are still
[1:46:53] married
[1:46:55] absolutely when I took my bow that
[1:47:00] settles it
[1:47:01] she's my wife as long as there is life
[1:47:04] in us she is my wife
[1:47:08] that's her bow but what appreciation she
[1:47:12] does for that she stays home and takes
[1:47:16] care of the children and tries to be a
[1:47:19] real wife
[1:47:26] when God accepted the cry the sacrifice
[1:47:30] surprised he accepted Christ that's why
[1:47:35] he went into a heaven right after he
[1:47:39] died and rose again
[1:47:40] the story did not stop there he was it
[1:47:43] went him to heaven that means God the
[1:47:47] Father accepted the sacrifice but did
[1:47:51] you know that when God accepted Christ
[1:47:55] he has accepted you with it he did not
[1:48:03] look at your weakness he did not look at
[1:48:08] all the sins that you've committed he
[1:48:13] look at the holiness of Christ he meant
[1:48:17] that holy blood saved you and when when
[1:48:21] he accepted the sacrifice he accepted
[1:48:24] you that's why the Bible taught you the
[1:48:26] accepted in the beloved
[1:48:28] you're only accepted in the beloved
[1:48:32] that's Christ our beloved hallelujah
[1:48:35] amen not because of any any good thing
[1:48:39] any good work that you did he already
[1:48:44] made a decision before the foundation of
[1:48:47] the world to marry you hallelujah
[1:48:52] and he wrote down your name in his book
[1:48:57] and it put a period to it
[1:49:05] nothing can change it
[1:49:08] bambam said he took a picture of you of
[1:49:10] his beautiful wife and in that picture
[1:49:15] you were not smoking your when you are
[1:49:18] not wearing a miniskirt amen
[1:49:22] you are not wasting your time on
[1:49:24] Facebook in that picture hallelujah you
[1:49:30] were as perfect as Christ was hallelujah
[1:49:38] whoo you know what that picture is
[1:49:41] Alleluia
[1:49:42] that's your theophany perfect picture
[1:49:48] Alleluia after you leave this this body

[1:50:41] years now and I'm still alive and

[1:51:42] we're all going back to that
[1:51:46] you see when God gave you grace you have
[1:51:51] to accept it
[1:51:53] oh my you have to hurry her bomb said

[1:52:03] of sin but you have to accept it
[1:52:07] his Amen you have to accept grace don't
[1:52:14] be like the Israelites they wanted the
[1:52:17] law you have to accept your pardoning or
[1:52:22] God would destroy the world the very
[1:52:27] first thing that that was committed
[1:52:29] would rock her off her place the world
[1:52:32] because he is holy his words are right
[1:52:38] and we are stewards of God's grace first
[1:52:43] Peter chapter 4 verse 10 every man had
[1:52:47] received the gift even to minister the

[1:53:16] she received grace should be able to
[1:53:19] give them away give it away James

[1:53:51] you had an out short shot coming in your
[1:53:54] life hallelujah but he giveth more grace
[1:54:02] he giveth more grace wherefore he said
[1:54:05] God resisteth the proud but giveth grace
[1:54:08] unto the humble
[1:54:14] arrogant people self-righteous people
[1:54:18] they cannot handle great
[1:54:26] but God gives grace only to the humble
[1:54:36] the Pharisees thought they had it all
[1:54:40] they couldn't take it
[1:54:44] hallelujah they couldn't take the the
[1:54:47] grace of God that was being manifested
[1:54:50] in Christ

[1:55:51] here on earth to reconcile people unto
[1:55:55] God we can sell sinners and to a holy
[1:55:58] God that's what he did and the same
[1:56:02] ministry he has given to us
[1:56:07] Jesus is not here anymore but the bride
[1:56:11] is here to continue his word he has
[1:56:15] given to us the Ministry of
[1:56:17] reconciliation to wit that God was in
[1:56:21] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:56:24] himself not imputing their trespasses on
[1:56:29] them that had committed unto us
[1:56:33] committed and to who and to us the word
[1:56:38] of reconciliation
[1:56:42] this word that people see message of the
[1:56:46] hour is the word of reconciliation

[1:57:04] this is our ministry this is the
[1:57:07] ministry of the bride today Ministry of
[1:57:10] reconciliation Alleluia not the Ministry
[1:57:15] of conflict
[1:57:17] not a Ministry of controversy
[1:57:26] I don't blame blame people for calling
[1:57:29] the message the message but they don't
[1:57:35] realize we have been given this
[1:57:38] responsibility of reconciling the world
[1:57:41] unto God God was in Christ now Christ is
[1:57:47] in us reconciling the world unto himself
[1:57:51] everything that's what he's got in God
[1:57:53] he poured into Christ and everything
[1:57:55] that was in Christ is now poured into
[1:57:57] the bride of Jesus Christ and now we
[1:57:59] have to do the work of reconciliation
[1:58:03] hallelujah
[1:58:05] Luke chapter 7 verse 47
[1:58:12] jesus said but wherefore I say unto thee
[1:58:15] her sins which are many are forgiven for
[1:58:18] she loved mots
[1:58:20] but to whom little is forgiven I'm the
[1:58:23] same loving little just say this to
[1:58:26] Simon the Pharisee who thought he was so
[1:58:29] sure he was so righteous in the sight of
[1:58:32] God no he was righteous in his own sight
[1:58:37] hallelujah and
[1:58:41] the Lord told him a parable about two
[1:58:45] people owing somebody a great debt or
[1:58:49] some debt one owed him fifty and the
[1:58:53] other owed him five hundred pence and
[1:58:56] having nothing to be able to pay back
[1:59:00] the debt and then the the benefactor
[1:59:03] actually forgave them both and the Lord
[1:59:07] asked the question who do you think we
[1:59:09] love the the the one that that forgave
[1:59:14] them more
[1:59:17] though the Lord said Simon answered the
[1:59:21] right question and said you said it
[1:59:25] right before I sent to you her sins
[1:59:28] the sin of this woman that was kissing
[1:59:32] her his feet and Simon was condemning
[1:59:36] him in his heart because he was an
[1:59:39] ill-favored woman and and he was having
[1:59:43] a ministers meeting right in his house
[1:59:45] and this woman came man is known to be a
[1:59:50] prostitute and he was kissing the feet
[1:59:53] of the Lord Jesus hallelujah and he was
[1:59:58] thinking not in my house
[2:00:02] I'll endure but the Lord said the woman
[2:00:09] is kissing my feet because he loves you
[2:00:11] more than you do because her since were
[2:00:16] married the more sins were forgiven the
[2:00:21] more scenes that are forgiven the more
[2:00:24] you love the Lord I thank God that he
[2:00:28] meant people gave all my seeds I love
[2:00:33] you hallelujah the one that's forgiven
[2:00:37] the most number of seeds will love the
[2:00:39] Lord most demos hallelujah
[2:00:42] see rejecters of grace are not able to
[2:00:45] give grace
[2:00:49] you see them alone around the message
[2:00:51] movement today around the message
[2:00:54] churches people find it hard to forgive
[2:00:58] find it hard to tolerate others that are
[2:01:02] not as holy and as righteous as
[2:01:04] themselves you know why because they
[2:01:08] have not received the grace they did not
[2:01:10] understand they did not have a
[2:01:12] revelation of what grace was all about
[2:01:16] we are in the bride because of the grace
[2:01:19] of God we are saved we are enjoying
[2:01:26] eternal life because of the grace of God
[2:01:28] hallelujah because we are all under the
[2:01:32] blood the shed blood of the Lamb
[2:01:35] how can look at other people who are not
[2:01:38] doing as good as we are and condemned

[2:05:11] can do this
[2:05:12] I asked forgiveness of my sin
[2:05:16] I asked forgiveness of the sins of those
[2:05:19] who are around the altar
[2:05:23] since of our church fellow church mates
[2:05:26] I asked forgiveness for this church for
[2:05:30] the body of believers nationally I see
[2:05:34] Christ praying in better Branham this is
[2:05:37] Christ in better Brandis not bad man
[2:05:39] it's Christ in better belly asking for
[2:05:42] forgiveness not only for himself but for
[2:05:45] others for a whole nation not only for
[2:05:51] the whole nation
[2:05:52] and he said internationally
[2:05:57] no better but it sounds old me so this
[2:06:01] this kind of problem happens in the
[2:06:04] Philippines likewise

[2:06:27] Universal but Barrera asked for
[2:06:32] forgiveness of the national sins and
[2:06:35] also the international since I asked for
[2:06:39] mercy for us being dilatory concerning
[2:06:43] the things of the kingdom
[2:06:53] I ask that you will pardon us of our
[2:06:55] sins and take our take away our
[2:06:58] transgression and forgive us for being
[2:07:02] so stupid
[2:07:13] and we think if we're so smart
[2:07:16] environment said forgive us not for
[2:07:18] being so stupid
[2:07:20] or the stupidity of the people or how we
[2:07:25] come short bamm-bamm says how we have
[2:07:28] taken bodily exercise we have done
[2:07:32] things that we ought not to have done

[2:07:47] spirit in me that you had in you it's
[2:07:51] this your desire the same kind of spirit
[2:07:56] that was in Jesus I want it to be in me
[2:08:00] I want that kind of a spirit that if my
[2:08:05] enemy spit could be hanging from my face
[2:08:09] and with all my heart I could say I
[2:08:11] forgive you for it and I could forgive
[2:08:14] others as Christ as God for Christ's
[2:08:17] sake forgave us on that while the spit
[2:08:21] of your enemy is still hanging on your
[2:08:24] face you are already willing to forgive
[2:08:27] that person
[2:08:30] how many times have you heard say Oh
[2:08:33] give it time I just can't do it now
[2:08:40] but you have to talk to him brother he's
[2:08:43] your brother he's your sister not now
[2:08:48] I'm still hurting or somebody say you
[2:08:56] know when you're hurt it creates a scar
[2:09:01] sometimes it takes time for the scar to
[2:09:04] be healed but better Bram said when your
[2:09:07] enemy spits on your face and the spit is
[2:09:10] still hanging on your face you should be
[2:09:12] able to be willing to forgive already
[2:09:15] that person Oh
[2:09:20] may God give us up this spirit the
[2:09:23] spirit of grace
[2:09:26] hallelujah
[2:09:30] and then let me just coat this again

[2:09:46] heart and wash their feet do anything
[2:09:51] that I could so they don't miss that
[2:09:53] glorious sweet by-and-by
[2:09:59] the Reverend was willing to wash their
[2:10:01] feet when it says God teach me to
[2:10:07] forgive my enemy
[2:10:08] it was the thinking of Communists is
[2:10:12] that keep thinking of criminals is that
[2:10:15] thinking of persecutors it's thinking
[2:10:18] about people in the church
[2:10:22] people in the church sometimes we
[2:10:25] perceived them as enemies
[2:10:29] just because they're not like us
[2:10:35] hallelujah
[2:10:36] Oh Bertram said teach me to love my
[2:10:39] enemy and to be able to wash their feet
[2:10:42] what for not for my own sake not so not
[2:10:48] so that I make make make it to the
[2:10:49] rapture Lord I'm willing to do that
[2:10:52] humble myself
[2:10:53] watch my enemies feet so that I may get
[2:10:55] to the rub you know that's not his
[2:10:57] reason it's both he but must so that
[2:11:00] they don't miss that glorious sweet
[2:11:02] by-and-by so that for me I'm doing this
[2:11:05] for them Lord oh my god help us
[2:11:13] hallelujah
[2:11:14] you know better bottom call rap
[2:11:16] cheering grace we always say rupturing
[2:11:21] faith right but Bertram calls it many
[2:11:24] times wrap cheering grace you look in
[2:11:27] the message it's because it's rupturing
[2:11:29] grace
[2:11:31] because even rapture comes to you by the
[2:11:34] grace of God it happens by the grace of
[2:11:38] God rapture is a revelation but man says
[2:11:42] you can't even understand it you can
[2:11:45] even comprehend it hallelujah unless God
[2:11:48] reveals it to you
[2:11:53] but one said and that's the way a
[2:11:55] Christian is we planted together in
[2:11:58] Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible
[2:12:01] fountain of life we are planted in

[2:12:24] Ghost for Europe you are planted in
[2:12:27] Christ if you receive the baptism of the
[2:12:31] Holy Ghost
[2:12:31] you are already planted in Christ and
[2:12:34] what do you need to do just drink and
[2:12:37] drink and drink and drink some more
[2:12:41] hallelujah what does it do it pushes out
[2:12:44] what you have drunk drink from the grace
[2:12:48] of God drink from the word I will drink
[2:12:51] of the Spirit of God and it pushes out

[2:13:38] oh my it's like that Keiichi go over
[2:13:43] bottom or she own the cage eagle and as
[2:13:48] I laid there he said in his great eyes
[2:13:50] looking towards heaven the blue skies
[2:13:52] above him is a heavenly bird he lives in
[2:13:55] the heavens he was born to live in the
[2:13:56] heavens that's his nature to live on
[2:13:59] high and here is be the case over him
[2:14:02] and he can't get up anymore I thought
[2:14:06] that was one of the saddest sights I've
[2:14:09] ever near Lee seen and walking away from
[2:14:15] there the Holy Spirit seemed to say to
[2:14:17] me that afternoon setting in the park
[2:14:19] where I was I couldn't get it off my
[2:14:21] mind and I wanted to buy the bird but
[2:14:24] they wouldn't let me have him
[2:14:27] it was a sad sight and then Birnbaum
[2:14:31] said this and I felt sorry for him but
[2:14:34] when the Lord spoke to me
[2:14:38] in this matter here's the worst sight
[2:14:42] than that
[2:14:44] there's men and women walking the
[2:14:47] streets that was born to be sons and
[2:14:50] daughters of God living below their
[2:14:53] privilege beating their brains out in
[2:14:57] nightclubs and everything else when they
[2:15:00] should be soaring the skies of God's
[2:15:02] great to great pleasure and power
[2:15:08] oh you are Eagles but you are limiting
[2:15:18] yourself with the things of the world
[2:15:21] with expectations of people around you
[2:15:26] you are living below your god-given
[2:15:30] privileges privileges because you are
[2:15:33] sons and daughters of God you ought to
[2:15:37] be sorry the skies and not leading on
[2:15:45] this earth and limiting yourself to the
[2:15:49] things of the world like John
[2:15:55] god John was asked come up here don't
[2:16:01] stay there John there's nothing good
[2:16:04] where you're staying
[2:16:05] there's scorpions and it's too dry there
[2:16:11] that's just rocks and prisoners and all
[2:16:17] evil things taking place down there you
[2:16:20] don't have to stay there come up here I
[2:16:25] don't care what situation you're in now
[2:16:28] you don't have to stay there come up
[2:16:32] here they're your sons and daughters of
[2:16:35] God Alleluia
[2:16:44] now
[2:16:46] we know we are living in the most in the
[2:16:49] darkest of all the ages
[2:16:53] and about two years ago we read of this
[2:17:04] incident in Nevada there was a shooting
[2:17:08] a man just started shooting the people
[2:17:12] that they were attending some kind of a
[2:17:15] concert or something and a man just
[2:17:18] started shooting them with automatic gun
[2:17:22] shots and several people were died
[2:17:27] and I read about it this the shooter
[2:17:31] Steven pada
[2:17:32] it was the Nevada shooter he he was
[2:17:36] amassing well it was wallowing in
[2:17:39] pleasure and was seen with prostitutes
[2:17:41] before the shooting they before the
[2:17:44] shooting he was living life for himself
[2:17:50] Bertrand said when when you wonder why
[2:17:52] we got juvenile delinquency stopping
[2:17:55] people to death on the street and we
[2:17:57] become neurotic cases because we have
[2:17:59] left our God and we've accepted Creed's
[2:18:01] in our church instead of the Holy Spirit
[2:18:06] they god help us
[2:18:08] not to reject grace
[2:18:15] and received instead of the grace of God
[2:18:19] except churchianity her mom said
[2:18:25] Alleluia denominationalism is
[2:18:28] churchianity explaing and chapter
[2:18:30] Jannetty it's centered on the church in
[2:18:35] the system and the problem we don't want
[2:18:39] churchianity we want true christianity
[2:18:43] which is christ centered hallelujah
[2:18:48] you see
[2:18:51] the more sin abounds
[2:18:55] more grace about
[2:18:58] Romans chapter 5 verse 20 and 21
[2:19:01] moreover the law entered that the
[2:19:05] offence might abound but where sin
[2:19:09] abounded grace did much more abound
[2:19:14] I say amen to that verse there's there's
[2:19:19] so much scene grace abounds so much more
[2:19:24] amen sin the sin of the world cannot be
[2:19:28] any greater than the grace of God
[2:19:32] there's no scene I don't care how it
[2:19:35] what kind of scene it is
[2:19:38] there's no scene that cannot be covered
[2:19:41] by the grace of God hallelujah
[2:19:46] [Applause]
[2:19:48] that a scene reigned unto death even so
[2:19:50] my grace reign through righteousness
[2:19:52] unto eternal life by Jesus our Lord
[2:19:56] hallelujah
[2:20:00] we know this world is coming to an end
[2:20:03] this world is afraid it's like a brother

[2:20:42] knows it people of the world knows it
[2:20:44] hallelujah
[2:20:46] they know it's lingering near it builds
[2:20:49] up to a pressure of course to the sinner
[2:20:52] but to the Christian who is instructed
[2:20:56] in the Word of God ought to know that
[2:21:00] the coming that that's the coming of the
[2:21:03] Lord
[2:21:04] sinners should be afraid but the
[2:21:07] Christians who have been instructed in

[2:21:12] just the coming of the Lord amen
[2:21:16] [Music]

[2:21:50] a Christian in other words we should be
[2:21:53] rejoicing that these things are taking
[2:21:56] place but we said look out because your
[2:22:00] redemption is drawing nigh this is what
[2:22:04] we live for
[2:22:06] someone said not too long ago to me said
[2:22:09] brother branham you scared the people
[2:22:11] when you talked about he might come the
[2:22:13] next hour
[2:22:17] I tell my people before the service is
[2:22:20] over the Lord might just come before the
[2:22:24] services even over and and people say
[2:22:28] you're scaring the people that way you
[2:22:30] scare the people when you talk about he
[2:22:32] might come in the next hour I said scare
[2:22:34] the people not these people
[2:22:37] see that's the greatest note that we can
[2:22:40] sound that's what we're looking for
[2:22:43] behold the bridegroom coming why that's
[2:22:47] what we live for
[2:22:49] that's the hour that we are all living
[2:22:51] for I know nothing could be greater than
[2:22:54] that hour but to the sinner of course

[2:23:01] you're a believer hallelujah
[2:23:05] they call me mister grace that's all
[2:23:09] right
[2:23:10] Paul is known to be the apostle of grace
[2:23:14] he said this
[2:23:17] but by the grace of God I am what I am
[2:23:21] and His grace which has bestowed upon he
[2:23:25] has bestowed upon me was not in vain but
[2:23:28] I laboured more abundantly than they all
[2:23:31] yet not i but the grace of God which was
[2:23:34] within me all that they ever did for God
[2:23:38] all that you ever do for God and will
[2:23:41] desire to do for God hallelujah we can
[2:23:45] only do it by the grace of God it's not
[2:23:47] astrally doing it hallelujah
[2:23:53] Paul said it it's not i but the grace of
[2:23:57] God which was with me therefore whether
[2:24:00] it were I or they we preach and so he
[2:24:03] believed
[2:24:05] hallelujah now you just go through this
[2:24:09] second Corinthians chapter 8 verse 1 to
[2:24:12] 5 this is the the grace of God that was
[2:24:15] bestowed upon the Macedonians
[2:24:20] I can say this is the same grace that
[2:24:23] was bestowed upon the people of
[2:24:25] Sheffield moreover brethren we do you
[2:24:31] wit you to wit of the grace of God
[2:24:33] bestowed upon the churches of Macedonia
[2:24:37] how that in a great trial of affliction
[2:24:40] abundance of their joy and their deep
[2:24:42] poverty abounded unto the riches of
[2:24:44] their liberality or to their power I
[2:24:47] bear record J beyond their power they
[2:24:51] were willing of themselves praying us
[2:24:53] with must entreaty that we should
[2:24:56] receive the gift and take upon us the
[2:24:59] Fellowship of the ministering of to the
[2:25:02] Saints they were giving Paul a certain
[2:25:06] amount of money that he collected
[2:25:08] amongst the Saints in Macedonia and they
[2:25:10] were pleading please receive it
[2:25:14] hallelujah and Paul said we received it
[2:25:20] because they were praying with us we
[2:25:22] mustn't wheaty that they would receive
[2:25:24] the gap that we would receive the gift
[2:25:27] and take upon us the Fellowship of the
[2:25:29] ministering of the saints oh my this is
[2:25:33] a wonderful fellowship
[2:25:35] hallelujah an exclusive fellowship not
[2:25:40] everyone is able to do it but if you're
[2:25:44] able to give to the cost towards of
[2:25:46] course then you are part of this circle
[2:25:48] of fellowship what kind of fellowship
[2:25:51] the fellowship of ministering to the
[2:25:54] Saints oh my and this they did not as
[2:26:00] they hope but first they gave their own
[2:26:03] selves to the Lord you can never do this
[2:26:06] you can never give towards the cost
[2:26:09] surprise if you don't give you first
[2:26:12] give yourself to God
[2:26:14] first give yourself to the Lord and then
[2:26:17] you can give to the cause hallelujah
[2:26:22] and unto us by the will of God
[2:26:26] we then as workers together with him
[2:26:28] beseech you also
[2:26:31] that you received not the grace of God
[2:26:33] in vain
[2:26:35] this is my appeal to you this morning
[2:26:39] are you beneficiaries of God's grace
[2:26:44] and I urge you don't receive it in vain
[2:26:49] if you receive it give it away God has
[2:26:55] been gracious to you
[2:26:56] be gracious to other people hallelujah

[2:27:18] so we're leaving I wrote ironic lives
[2:27:22] second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 3 to
[2:27:24] 8 to 10 giving no offence in anything
[2:27:27] that the ministry be not blamed but in
[2:27:32] all things
[2:27:33] approving ourselves as the ministers of
[2:27:36] God in much patience in afflictions in
[2:27:40] necessities in distress in stripes and
[2:27:44] imprisonments in tumults in Labor's in
[2:27:47] watchings and in fastings by pureness by
[2:27:50] knowledge by long-suffering by kindness
[2:27:53] by the Holy Ghost by love unfeigned by
[2:27:56] the word of the truth word of truth by
[2:27:59] the power of God by the armor of
[2:28:02] righteousness on the right hand and on
[2:28:04] the left by honor and dishonor by evil
[2:28:07] report and good report as deceivers and
[2:28:09] yet true as unknown and yet well known
[2:28:12] as dying and behold we live as chastened
[2:28:16] and not killed as sorrowful yet always
[2:28:20] rejoicing as the poor as poor yet making
[2:28:22] many rich as having nothing yet
[2:28:26] processing all things
[2:28:29] you have Christ in your life you possess
[2:28:33] all things but it's so sad that people
[2:28:39] will miss him a warning when mom says
[2:28:43] quoting the scriptures let him that is
[2:28:46] filty be filthy still let him that is
[2:28:49] righteous be righteous still that team
[2:28:51] that is holy be holy still
[2:28:53] hallelujah the thing is closed oh
[2:28:56] brother and then what
[2:28:59] he said this in the breach when mercy
[2:29:02] will be over grace will be over but soon
[2:29:08] you know after both than the kinsmen
[2:29:11] work then he come and claimed his
[2:29:14] possessed possession and that's exactly
[2:29:16] what the Bible said it on become he come
[2:29:19] forth and took the book and then the
[2:29:22] intercession is over he is off the
[2:29:26] throne and there is no more blood on the
[2:29:30] mercy seat
[2:29:32] and preachers in the message coat this
[2:29:36] statements a lot and it brings fear into
[2:29:39] the hearts of the people
[2:29:42] because in our country there's a
[2:29:44] teaching that goes around that after the
[2:29:47] seals were opened the blog has went off
[2:29:51] the mercy seat and there's no more mercy
[2:29:54] grace is over hallelujah
[2:30:00] and Bernie Bernbaum said don't let me be
[2:30:02] said don't let it be said some of these
[2:30:04] days I thought the rapture was supposed
[2:30:07] to come and hear the voice say back in
[2:30:10] the past god help you God and here the
[2:30:14] boys say back it's in the past
[2:30:16] I thought the rapture was gonna take
[2:30:19] place but in the it's in the past it
[2:30:21] happened already
[2:30:22] you didn't know it
[2:30:28] they said there's no more intercession I
[2:30:31] don't believe that
[2:30:33] hallelujah now listen to this quotation
[2:30:36] and I'll end with this now in the day of
[2:30:39] mercy now it's the day of mercy
[2:30:43] well now it's the day of mercy now let's
[2:30:49] go back in the Old Testament they're
[2:30:51] here just a little bit and find out what
[2:30:53] mercy is going back and see what
[2:30:56] happened to this role this role of
[2:30:59] course is the judgment see he the reason
[2:31:02] today that we were there is mercy it's
[2:31:05] because the mercy seat is sprinkled with
[2:31:08] atonement the blood and as long as blood
[2:31:14] is on the judgment seat then it is not
[2:31:16] judgment no more it is mercy because
[2:31:21] something died to stay judgment if you
[2:31:26] see it's amen as long as blood is on the
[2:31:30] mercy seat it shows that something died
[2:31:33] to hold judgment back but when the
[2:31:37] church is raptured are you're listening
[2:31:40] when the church is raptured then the
[2:31:44] mercy seat becomes a judgment see I
[2:31:47] think this there's no need for
[2:31:49] clarification here hallelujah you see
[2:31:54] this is the timeline the beginning and
[2:31:56] the ending and the prophet of God was
[2:32:00] taken into eternity the divine rearm so
[2:32:05] that he's able to see the beginning and
[2:32:07] the end well he speaks about the
[2:32:11] beginning except it's in the present he
[2:32:14] speaks about what's happening in the
[2:32:16] present as in in presence everything is
[2:32:18] present as when you're in eternity
[2:32:20] everything is in present tense that's
[2:32:24] why God said I am that I am
[2:32:29] you never said I had been he never said
[2:32:34] I will be but I am that I am
[2:32:38] because he's not limited by time he is a
[2:32:41] God of eternity that's why I'm preaching
[2:32:45] about our eternal priesthood amen
[2:32:50] so the prophet of God is here and it's
[2:32:52] just a big beginning to the end and it's
[2:32:55] it's the end when mercy is over and is
[2:32:58] telling the people as if it's in the
[2:33:00] present tense this is how the people
[2:33:03] were confused hallelujah he says he says
[2:33:08] Christ getting off the mercy seat
[2:33:10] hallelujah and the blood is off the
[2:33:13] mercy seat and that's when the a filthy
[2:33:16] will become filthy still and the holy
[2:33:18] people will become holy or still mercy
[2:33:21] will be over but what happened he was
[2:33:24] taken to the eternal realm's and people
[2:33:28] in the timeline hallelujah they don't
[2:33:32] understand that they don't get it
[2:33:34] hallelujah
[2:33:36] they say mercy there were how can we be
[2:33:40] over
[2:33:41] how can you limit the grace of God do
[2:33:46] you realize that when the seats were
[2:33:48] open heaven was actually open to us and
[2:33:52] Bellavance says heaven consists of the
[2:33:55] word heaven is filled with the word so
[2:34:01] when heaven was opened when the seals
[2:34:03] were opened
[2:34:04] I believe there's more grace for the
[2:34:07] bride more grace for the people
[2:34:10] hallelujah God has not stopped
[2:34:14] interceding for us
[2:34:17] hallelujah that's fine second Peter
[2:34:21] chapter 3 verse 21 chapter 3 verse 18 it
[2:34:25] says but we need to grow in grace and in
[2:34:28] the knowledge of our Lord Jesus a view
[2:34:31] Jesus Christ to him be glory both now
[2:34:34] and forever hallelujah we love the
[2:34:38] message but we need to grow in grace
[2:34:43] hallelujah we need to grow in the
[2:34:45] knowledge about the message knowledge
[2:34:47] about the Godhead baptism the seals and
[2:34:50] theophanies and all these wonderful
[2:34:52] things the mysteries have been brought
[2:34:54] to us we need those but first we need to
[2:34:57] grow in grace hallelujah
[2:35:07] two more slides we're over
[2:35:10] there's more of God to be had to be had
[2:35:13] you believe that
[2:35:16] you might think I've had enough of God
[2:35:18] but there's more of God to be had and
[2:35:22] you need to crave it there's more of God
[2:35:27] to be had and father so many things
[2:35:31] could be said right here maybe the
[2:35:33] church wouldn't understand but I pray
[2:35:36] that you will give them such a crave for
[2:35:38] it
[2:35:38] see that's the key you need to crave for
[2:35:40] it pay for what more of God you are
[2:35:47] blessed with God's mercy and grace in
[2:35:50] the past but there's more mercy for you
[2:35:55] he giveth more grace but in order to
[2:36:01] receive it you have to crave for it
[2:36:05] hallelujah Lord that they will come and
[2:36:09] see you we're at the end time the
[2:36:12] astronaut age I pray father that they
[2:36:15] will realize it is that isn't trying it
[2:36:17] isn't trying to condemn what they had
[2:36:19] it's only trying to give them more
[2:36:21] rapturing grace Mary BAM calls it
[2:36:25] rupturing what grace
[2:36:30] rapturing base for the hour will come
[2:36:32] when we'll have to have a rupture power
[2:36:35] rapture power oh I like that term
[2:36:38] rapture power I will do here doctor
[2:36:45] power everybody say that means rapture
[2:36:48] power oh my goodness hallelujah the hour
[2:36:54] will come well we'll have to have
[2:36:56] rapture power not only to heal the body
[2:37:01] but to change it in a moment in a
[2:37:04] twinkling of an eye Christ will be so
[2:37:07] real to their bodies until that he can
[2:37:09] change it by his great death and what he
[2:37:13] has purchased don't let anybody tell you
[2:37:19] intercession is over because my Bible
[2:37:23] says it's not over Hebrews chapter 7
[2:37:26] verse 25 says wherefore he is able also
[2:37:31] to save them to the uttermost even the
[2:37:36] mountains of the Philippines the
[2:37:38] remotest islands in the Philippines God
[2:37:41] is able to save them to the uttermost
[2:37:43] hallelujah that come unto God by him
[2:37:47] it's still happening God is still in the
[2:37:51] saving business I'm telling you God is
[2:37:54] still in the healing business if you're
[2:37:57] sick today God still can heal you
[2:38:01] hallelujah
[2:38:02] why because said the Bible said see he
[2:38:06] ever liveth to make intercession for
[2:38:10] them hallelujah
[2:38:13] how long does he live ever liveth for
[2:38:21] all eternity he lives while he is living
[2:38:26] he will not cease to intercede for you
[2:38:30] and me
[2:38:31] how can mercy be over hallelujah when we
[2:38:39] are here because of grace we don't
[2:38:43] deserve it
[2:38:45] you know what we deserve you deserve to
[2:38:47] go to hell but God so loved the world
[2:38:51] that He gave His only begotten Son that

[2:49:39] [Applause]
[2:49:41] [Music]
[2:49:44] look at the Lord Jesus here was a woman
[2:49:49] the Pharisees they brought her to Jesus
[2:49:52] they wanted her to be helped so much
[2:49:56] that they brought her to Jesus they said
[2:50:00] Lord Jesus this woman was she needs help
[2:50:04] in her life betting what they did they
[2:50:08] brought her to Jesus to condemn her are
[2:50:13] you with me and here the mercy of God
[2:50:19] the one that David song and then the one
[2:50:25] that Ezekiel saw the same mercy of God
[2:50:28] that supplied the angel with the softest
[2:50:30] hands when Elijah was in the midst of
[2:50:32] his depression the same mercy of God
[2:50:37] didn't even look up just rode in the
[2:50:39] sand now I want you to watch this did
[2:50:41] not even look up
[2:50:45] he just said whichever one of you are
[2:50:49] without sin let him cast the first stone
[2:50:56] I'd say you heard thudd thudd thudd
[2:51:01] maybe she was standing there and
[2:51:04] wondering winner of the thuds gonna
[2:51:05] cease when's the last thud but you see
[2:51:10] there's not one of those stones could be
[2:51:13] thrown and come against her because the
[2:51:17] Lamb of God in the mind of God had
[2:51:20] already paid the price in the mind of
[2:51:23] God there was nothing that could stop
[2:51:27] and hinder the grace of God from
[2:51:30] reaching her life I don't care how many
[2:51:34] stones or things that the enemy tried to
[2:51:38] bring at her life to try to hang over
[2:51:40] her there's nothing that could stop the
[2:51:43] grace of God from reaching her but then
[2:51:48] came the words out of there Jesus said a
[2:51:51] woman where are your accusers you see
[2:51:59] the Bible tells us while he was here
[2:52:02] walking in flesh he bore our sicknesses
[2:52:09] while he was here not even yet on
[2:52:12] Calvary he was announcing even there
[2:52:17] this is what the blood
[2:52:23] will do
[2:52:25] it removes all accusations the enemy
[2:52:33] might be able to say well you made a
[2:52:36] mistake even this morning on the way to
[2:52:38] church but you see God looking through
[2:52:41] the blood he can see what the desire is
[2:52:45] in our heart you see he paid the price
[2:52:48] that the desire within us might become
[2:52:51] alive that's what he did when Rahab
[2:52:58] stepped out of Jericho now you know she
[2:53:04] was not gonna be able to get married to
[2:53:06] Salman because if she still had you know
[2:53:12] living husbands but here's the grace of
[2:53:16] God she comes out and here's the
[2:53:20] ceremony taking place she's got to
[2:53:24] remain outside of the camp but she's
[2:53:25] brought in to the camp by Simone she's
[2:53:28] brought in to Covenant by Simone she's
[2:53:31] brought in to Israel we have been
[2:53:33] brought in to the Covenant by Jesus
[2:53:36] Christ
[2:53:37] Boaz brought Ruth in Jesus Christ
[2:53:41] brought us in and as they're standing is
[2:53:46] there anyone you know how the marriage
[2:53:48] ceremony go is there anyone would see
[2:53:50] just cause why these two shall not be
[2:53:51] joined together in holy matrimony let
[2:53:53] him speak now or forever hold their
[2:53:55] peace and they looked around in
[2:53:58] Revelations 5 and there was no accuser
[2:54:03] there was no accusation because you know
[2:54:06] why there was no one left to say she
[2:54:11] can't be are you with me all of the
[2:54:17] accusations of Jericho where she was
[2:54:20] living it ceased under the judgment of
[2:54:24] God and when the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:54:28] was shed sin was annihilated under the
[2:54:32] blood of Jesus Christ
[2:54:35] righteous judgment of all-mighty God you
[2:54:40] say what are you saying brother son I'm
[2:54:42] saying don't live in Jericho no more
[2:54:46] receive the grace of God walk out of
[2:54:49] there and be united with Simone let us
[2:54:51] show our appreciation as he told the
[2:54:54] woman where are thy neck users you see
[2:54:57] he wanted her to look around he could
[2:54:59] have told her hey hey hey hey look you
[2:55:01] don't have no more users no he wanted
[2:55:02] her to see where are you dine accusers
[2:55:07] she no doubt she's trying to lift her
[2:55:10] head she looks no feet now her eyes
[2:55:15] maybe start coming up or no legs
[2:55:22] there's none Lord he said neither do I
[2:55:26] can give a go and sin no more what grace
[2:55:37] is this what love is this you see what
[2:55:41] that does what God spoke to us this
[2:55:43] morning when we can receive it you say
[2:55:46] over the same if I can just know it's
[2:55:48] just received it with the gift of God
[2:55:49] it's a grace it's a gift
[2:55:51] you can't merit it you can't earn it you
[2:55:55] can't be good enough but what do I do
[2:55:58] just accept it a pardon itself is not a
[2:56:04] pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon
[2:56:08] and when you accept it as a pardon you
[2:56:12] are identifiying I am guilty but there
[2:56:15] is a righteous one I was under the
[2:56:18] condemnation of the fall but there's
[2:56:20] another man that came the man Christ
[2:56:23] Jesus and I'm under the righteousness of
[2:56:26] God of that purchase you can you see
[2:56:33] what that does it can allow you this
[2:56:35] morning if you just just allow the work
[2:56:38] of grace not not your work well I'm
[2:56:40] gonna go out of here and I'm gonna no
[2:56:43] just be appreciative of it and say Lord
[2:56:47] but you spoke through your servant this
[2:56:49] morning transform me I'm sure when
[2:56:58] brother Bannerman sister methi got
[2:56:59] married but there's a lot of times that
[2:57:03] maybe she burnt biscuits maybe she
[2:57:06] didn't know how to make mashed potatoes
[2:57:08] just right or you know you know you can
[2:57:10] go into your own foods you say what does
[2:57:11] that have to do with everything because
[2:57:13] she didn't know exactly maybe how to do
[2:57:15] everything just right but you know what
[2:57:17] she was showing her appreciation for the
[2:57:21] grace of God when it came time for
[2:57:23] dinner time there was meals on the table
[2:57:25] or this and that all of those things but
[2:57:29] after some time I could probably tell
[2:57:32] you that she probably came to a time
[2:57:34] where the mashed potatoes were palatable
[2:57:36] and then they kept getting better the
[2:57:39] biscuits you understand what I'm saying
[2:57:42] it's God's grace let God who began to
[2:57:47] work in you let him finish it
[2:57:50] so what do I do stay on the Potters will
[2:57:53] and he that has his hands on your life

[2:59:38] my goodness we feel like we're on top of
[2:59:40] the mountain you know what it is there's
[2:59:42] a witness there's a witness there that
[2:59:46] there is a body he spoke about it a
[2:59:48] theophany body amen where there is no
[2:59:52] clue no gloom but while walking through

[3:00:03] joy grace that has been ministered to
[3:00:06] our hearts today when you see this this

[3:00:26] that how do you feel you feel like oh I
[3:00:30] mean you're already a bundle of nerves

[3:00:44] first service that he came and spoke
[3:00:46] these things you know what he's doing
[3:00:52] he's creating that atmosphere we're not
[3:00:56] living by fear were to live by the love
[3:01:01] of God the grace of God
[3:01:05] does the salmon what are you saying I'm
[3:01:07] saying my pencils got an eraser on it
[3:01:10] that's what I'm saying are you with me
[3:01:17] and I'm also saying that I because
[3:01:20] sometimes that eraser wears out so I
[3:01:22] have one of them big pink erasers that's
[3:01:24] the brand on it called pink eraser I got
[3:01:27] one of those too oh my there must be a
[3:01:32] lot of people around you or failures no
[3:01:34] that's just for me but we want to be
[3:01:40] dispensers of that be channels of that
[3:01:47] you see even right here of what God's
[3:01:49] done for you listen to me carefully I'm
[3:01:51] not I don't want to take your time but
[3:01:54] I'm trying just to just drop these
[3:01:56] things and even when you go out of here
[3:01:58] this morning you testify of what God has
[3:02:04] done for you
[3:02:09] don't you allow the enemy to put
[3:02:10] something back nor you testify of what
[3:02:13] God's done for you he's healed me he's
[3:02:17] delivered me he set me free I've
[3:02:22] received that grace you say what do you
[3:02:23] say I put it all in a nutshell I'm a
[3:02:27] Christian
[3:02:28] you let that be your testimony the Bible
[3:02:31] says he's the high priest of our
[3:02:33] profession which is confession what we
[3:02:37] say that he is not I'm going to be no
[3:02:39] he's not going to be he is so he is we
[3:02:43] are I'm a Christian and you watch as
[3:02:48] you're speaking that word in the
[3:02:49] confession of the grace of God that
[3:02:52] you've received in your life and you
[3:02:53] watch your life your life begins to
[3:02:58] transform around that confession what is
[3:03:03] that that's God as you confess what he
[3:03:07] is it works in your life
[3:03:10] it works righteousness it works holiness
[3:03:13] in our life don't you love him this
[3:03:17] morning the grace of God where could we
[3:03:22] do without God's grace amen you love him
[3:03:27] lord help me to let it become more real
[3:03:33] in me I don't want to just a one and
[3:03:38] we're a Manning this service we're
[3:03:40] saying so be it I am NOT saying Amen
[3:03:43] because I know that quote I know that
[3:03:45] scripture I know that's now I'm saying
[3:03:46] Amen I'm saying Amen so being Lord let
[3:03:52] it move deeper in my life because you
[3:03:56] know as it moves deeper in me guess
[3:03:59] who's there's less of less of Samuel
[3:04:02] less of Samuel there's less of Joey
[3:04:05] there's less of Matthew Michael less of
[3:04:07] Aaron there's less of Rey there's less
[3:04:09] of Richard less of Tony there's less and
[3:04:12] more of him that's what we want amen
[3:04:17] so be it Lord in my life a man he's the
[3:04:22] high priest of our confession when
[3:04:24] you're on your job and you feel like in
[3:04:26] a low time sometimes you can go right
[3:04:28] out of this building
[3:04:28] and tomorrow you might feel a weight but
[3:04:31] remember though you leave this
[3:04:33] atmosphere here
[3:04:34] he didn't leave you he did not leave you
[3:04:37] he did not leave you so matter of fact
[3:04:42] he's always been with you he lets you
[3:04:48] know I've always watched over your life
[3:04:52] that's why when you should have lost
[3:04:54] your life years ago I was there I was
[3:04:58] there that's the grace of God we didn't
[3:05:03] know it we didn't deserve it but God's
[3:05:05] grace he said nothing's going to stop my
[3:05:08] grace from reaching my children God's
[3:05:15] still saving he's still filling with the
[3:05:19] Holy Ghost still healing Mercy is still
[3:05:24] present
[3:05:25] amen there's blood on the mercy seat the
[3:05:28] Lamb of God is still seated on the
[3:05:31] throne of God he's still wearing the
[3:05:34] priestly garment amen of his blood
[3:05:38] hallelujah he's still wearing that and
[3:05:42] we know him as the Lamb of God the Lamb
[3:05:47] that does what taketh away the sin of
[3:05:49] the world
[3:05:51] one of these morning's you'll change the
[3:05:54] garment from lamb to lion
[3:06:00] when he that transition comes our
[3:06:05] garment will change to our bodies will
[3:06:09] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[3:06:12] an eye but in me wonderful John Lily
[3:06:18] they said a lion had prevailed he looked
[3:06:19] to see a lamb I see y'all later
[3:06:22] but it's the authority of the lion
[3:06:25] speaking through the lamb neither do i
[3:06:29] condemn thee go and sin no more god and
[3:06:35] simplicity oh don't you love him this
[3:06:39] morning don't you love him Lord Jesus Oh

[3:07:18] the midst of his joy in the midst of his
[3:07:21] delight that where he was once a leper
[3:07:27] he had been made holy he paused and he
[3:07:32] he came back and said thank you for
[3:07:36] healing me
