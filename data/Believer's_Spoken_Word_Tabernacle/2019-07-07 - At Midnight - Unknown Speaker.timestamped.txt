[44:57] and I just appreciate your prayers I had
[45:00] different ones even from the assembly
[45:02] that just had even text me and let me
[45:05] know that just the Spirit of God had
[45:07] come upon them in prayer and they were
[45:09] interceding they went into a spirit of
[45:11] intercession for those services down
[45:12] Aaron I know that they weren't the only
[45:14] one there were many things there were
[45:16] brothers even coming into those meetings
[45:17] down there that we didn't find out till
[45:19] later but they had had many dreams of
[45:21] God supernaturally moving in those
[45:23] services and I could tell you the very
[45:25] beginning God supernaturally moved
[45:28] there's just so many differences to that
[45:31] we could say here but I won't take the
[45:34] time away how many souls were baptized
[45:38] brother Mike many was there about six or
[45:40] eight
[45:41] you don't remember you'll probably look
[45:43] too nervous brother Michael God God got
[45:45] ahold of brother Michael's life on
[45:46] Tuesday night and he walked into the
[45:55] waters of baptism to take on the name of
[45:57] the Lord Jesus Christ and a man and I
[46:05] tell you right while the preaching of
[46:07] the was going forth there were circles
[46:10] taking place right in those services
[46:11] eyes that were crossed were straightened
[46:13] right in those services Amen there were
[46:16] many many demons cast out within those
[46:18] services and in the prayer of many time
[46:21] that's my mom voice didn't go from the
[46:23] preaching it went from the praying and I
[46:26] tell you it was just it was our fillet
[46:29] through and you know you you look at
[46:32] there was nothing out said to you like
[46:33] this there was nothing watered-down
[46:35] about the word that was going forth
[46:37] there was nothing watered about it
[46:39] whatsoever and these young people were
[46:41] rejoicing in the Lord I'll tell you they
[46:44] were having a wonderful time I mean that
[46:46] the building was not too big to run in
[46:47] they I mean they were jumping they were
[46:50] shouting they were being filled with the
[46:51] Holy Ghost I tell you God was doing
[46:53] amazing amazing things I'm glad to be a
[46:56] part of what God is doing in this hour
[46:59] amen amen
[47:01] I just I think God for His mercy a man
[47:04] in the services so I just want to say I
[47:06] certainly appreciate your prayers now
[47:08] while we were gone and we just want to
[47:11] pull on the gift of God morning what God
[47:14] has for us how many believe that God
[47:16] knows what we have need of now what we
[47:20] have need of sometimes isn't always what
[47:22] we might want to receive but if we can
[47:25] say Lord I'll receive what you know that
[47:29] I have need of in my life you know
[47:31] because when you go to a doctor you can
[47:33] only tell the doctor your symptoms but
[47:35] the doctor himself is the one who can
[47:36] diagnose it and make the prognosis on
[47:39] this situation and that's what we want
[47:41] this morning we don't want to take our
[47:43] own will
[47:44] we Lord I want your will in my
[47:46] he knows the decisions he knows choices
[47:48] he knows everything that's before us and
[47:50] he's here in his word to influence our
[47:54] lives that we might make godly choices
[47:58] amen not just in days to come but even
[48:01] in this service right here amen you love
[48:03] the Lord amen let's just stand and we'll
[48:07] just sing the song as brother Jerry
[48:09] would come let's just sing the song
[48:11] Amazing Grace
[48:13] amen you know little Michael was singing
[48:16] up here and little Michael was singing
[48:18] that song and you know he he only sang
[48:21] certain words and I thought you know
[48:23] that's right sometimes we try to know
[48:26] too much and we know so much that we
[48:28] don't we're not even standing on what we
[48:30] know we know a whole lot of things we
[48:32] know a whole lot of quotes we know a
[48:34] whole lot of scriptures but it'd be best
[48:35] just to stand on what you know a man
[48:39] stand on what you know and wait for God
[48:41] to open more to you then you've got
[48:43] ground to stand on Amen that's what we
[48:45] want on our hearts as believers amen not
[48:48] may not know much but as long as we know
[48:50] the author that's what's important
[48:52] that's what's important he is the
[48:54] everything seeing grace
[49:00] [Music]
[49:27] now
[49:28] [Music]
[49:47] good to be here with you this morning
[49:51] let's just bow our heads in prayer
[49:54] Heavenly Father Lord we come before you
[49:57] this point of the service Lord we're
[49:59] asking God for your anointing they're
[50:02] gone for you to come Lord you're the
[50:05] real preacher Lord minister the word to
[50:08] the people today Lord to be a help to
[50:11] them dear God an encouragement I pray
[50:13] dear God of me
[50:14] that their needs be met and made their
[50:17] God there's any bound they'd be set free
[50:19] I pray Lord that you will Lord have your
[50:23] way in this service and have the
[50:25] preeminence in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[50:30] praise the Lord
[50:33] like to read from Acts chapter 16 verses
[50:38] 25 and 26
[50:50] amen
[50:53] acts 16 verse 25 and that midnight
[50:58] that's what I want to speak on tonight
[51:00] there this morning at midnight and at
[51:04] midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sing
[51:08] praises unto God and the prisoners heard
[51:11] them and suddenly you know we could use
[51:15] some suddenly in our Christian walk
[51:18] suddenly somebody gets saved suddenly
[51:22] somebody gets filled with all that go
[51:24] suddenly somebody gets delivered
[51:26] somebody gets healed he meant and
[51:30] suddenly there was a great earthquake so
[51:34] that the foundations of the prison were
[51:36] shaken and immediately all the doors
[51:39] were open
[51:40] everyone's bands were loosed you may be
[51:42] seated
[51:45] the word midnight is mentioned in 13
[51:48] different verses in the Bible
[51:51] you're familiar with the proverb of it's
[51:55] always darkest before the dawn
[51:57] we know the metaphorical meaning of that
[52:00] proverb but it's not entirely correct
[52:04] the darkest time of night is actually
[52:07] midnight when the Sun is a hundred and
[52:10] eighty degrees from the position where
[52:13] you are
[52:14] that's the darkest time the darkest time
[52:18] of 2019 will be December 21st that
[52:21] midnight
[52:24] that's when the Sun is the earth you
[52:27] know is tilted so we're away from the
[52:29] Sun tilted away from the Sun then the
[52:32] sun's 180 degrees on the other side and
[52:35] it's supposed to be the darkest night of
[52:37] the year
[52:40] but one minute after midnight starts a
[52:44] new day
[52:51] I was thinking of Moses and the children
[52:53] of Israel and you know they were having
[52:57] a very dark time being in bondage and
[53:02] Moses comes to him and talks to them and
[53:05] tells them the Lord has sent me down
[53:07] here and Aaron's going to be with me and
[53:10] we're gonna go talk to payroll and we're
[53:12] gonna get you set free and so the people
[53:16] were excited about this and they they
[53:24] begin to keep the Sabbath again
[53:27] and so they meant they rested on the
[53:30] Sabbath
[53:31] and so then Moses and Pharaoh or Aaron
[53:35] go to Pharaoh and when they get there
[53:38] they tell him let the people go so they
[53:40] can go three days journey into the
[53:42] wilderness that they may worship their
[53:44] God and Pharaoh says I don't know this
[53:50] God of Israel
[53:52] I don't know this God and he said in
[53:56] furthermore the the people or they got
[53:59] too much time on their hands and so from
[54:03] now on we're not going to give him any
[54:05] straw they're gonna have to gather their
[54:07] own straw man I don't want the tally of
[54:10] the bricks to be the same as it's always
[54:12] been so they have to do more since they
[54:15] got so much time to rest then we're
[54:19] going to give them more to do keep them
[54:20] busy
[54:22] and so the rulers the elders of Israel
[54:28] that were kind of officers I think the
[54:30] Bible calls them were set up over the
[54:32] the Israelites they the Italian bricks
[54:38] wasn't being kept up so they beat the
[54:41] officers and then the officers said it's
[54:46] not our fault they didn't know what had
[54:48] happened or what Mosiah I'm gonna give
[54:50] you you're gonna have to make your own
[54:52] bricks out of straw you gather and then
[54:59] they were in great tribulation here and
[55:05] it was a beginning to be a dark time in
[55:08] their lives darker than all the other
[55:11] years of bondage because it was getting
[55:14] greater and the more Moses went up
[55:17] before Pharaoh the angrier Pharaoh God
[55:19] and the more they beat the people and
[55:23] they went up then through nine plagues
[55:27] and each time Pharaoh's heart was
[55:32] hardened and you think about Moses Moses
[55:35] knew because God told him fables not
[55:38] gonna let him go I'm gonna harden his
[55:41] heart but Moses had to go up there
[55:43] anyway and tell him all right the next
[55:45] plagues gonna be this and the next leg
[55:47] is gonna be that and then God's gonna do
[55:50] this and then God's going to do that and
[55:53] knowing that it was going to fall on
[55:56] hardened ears but then finally the Lord
[56:02] moves and begins to speak to Moses and
[56:05] he says about midnight I'm gonna visit
[56:10] through the land and there's going to be
[56:12] death to every firstborn child to every
[56:18] firstborn from the animals all the way
[56:20] up to Faye roll himself
[56:23] and it gives Moses instructions that
[56:26] what Israel's to do was to slay a lamb
[56:29] and to take its blood and put it on the
[56:31] doorpost and that when the Death Angel
[56:35] pass through then it would pass over
[56:38] them that had the blood on the doorpost
[56:40] and so here comes the plague and it
[56:45] happens at midnight and if and then the
[56:51] death angel passes through and brother
[56:55] Branham says that a long about midnight
[56:59] there was a strange feeling of unrest
[57:02] even came over the Hebrews and then the
[57:08] Death Angel passed over every door that
[57:10] had the blood but took the lives of
[57:12] every firstborn from the cattle all the
[57:15] way up to the throne
[57:19] and it happened at midnight a dark time
[57:22] in their lives but at midnight come a
[57:26] dawning of a new day one minute after
[57:29] midnight they were free one time Samson
[57:38] went up to a place called Gaza and what
[57:41] he was doing up there he shouldn't have
[57:42] been up there in the first place the
[57:46] Bible says he went up there to see a
[57:48] prostitute so he shouldn't have been up
[57:51] there but you say well one can draw from
[57:53] this one the grace of God I'm thankful
[57:57] for the grace of God amen
[58:01] but Samson was there in Gaza and then he
[58:05] fell asleep and they the Philistines
[58:10] knew he was there so they were gonna lay
[58:11] and wait for him
[58:12] that in when he got up the next morning
[58:15] they were going to fall upon him and so
[58:18] they shut the gates of the city up fast
[58:21] and said they thought they had him
[58:23] locked inside now the Bible doesn't
[58:26] record why what happened or wide that
[58:30] Samson woke up but whether what it was
[58:35] God that woke him up or dreamed the God
[58:38] give him or whatever it was
[58:39] Samson woke up at midnight and at
[58:43] midnight Samson went up and took ahold
[58:46] of the doors of the gate and he lifted
[58:49] the doors of the gate in the post
[58:51] thereof and he carried them to a hill
[58:54] close to here on a heparin was somewhere
[58:59] around thirty six miles from Gaza and
[59:05] it's not meant that he actually carried
[59:07] him all the way to hedron but he carried
[59:09] him up on a hill from which hedron could
[59:12] be seen and he can't however many miles
[59:16] that was that was if Heda carried the
[59:18] gates one mile that was a miracle of
[59:22] course you know Hollywood paints him up
[59:26] to be some kind of muscle man and people
[59:29] you know amongst even the churches and
[59:31] paint him up to be some kind of muscular
[59:33] fella but we know the Prophet said he
[59:36] wasn't but the miracle was that he was
[59:39] just a natural looking fella but when
[59:42] the Holy Ghost came upon him when God's
[59:44] Spirit came upon him he had great
[59:47] strength slew a thousand Philistines
[59:52] with the jawbone of an ass
[59:56] he killed the lion like as if it was a
[59:59] lamb
[1:00:06] now back to where we started our text
[1:00:16] Paul and Silas came into this city and
[1:00:22] they began to preach in this city and
[1:00:26] there was a woman that had a spirit of
[1:00:30] divination on her and she followed them
[1:00:33] around and and kept proclaiming about
[1:00:38] them and
[1:00:42] after a while
[1:00:45] Paul turns around and rebukes the devil
[1:00:47] that's honoring cast the devil out the
[1:00:49] Bible says the devil left immediately
[1:00:52] and so the Masters of this woman saw
[1:00:55] that their prophet was going to be gone
[1:00:57] because they used her for Sue saying and
[1:01:01] so they laid hands on Paul and Silas and
[1:01:05] took them into to stand before the
[1:01:08] magistrate
[1:01:10] and told these Jews are troubling us
[1:01:15] and so they commanded them to rent their
[1:01:20] clothes off
[1:01:22] and they beat them and it said they laid
[1:01:26] on them many stripes and they cast him
[1:01:30] into a prison
[1:01:33] and then when they once they were casted
[1:01:35] in prison they told the jailer said you
[1:01:38] know you keep him fast
[1:01:40] don't let these two go so the jailer
[1:01:43] took him and put him on the innermost
[1:01:44] parts of the jail and then he put their
[1:01:49] feet in stocks do you know what stocks
[1:01:53] are it's two pieces of wood or iron or
[1:01:57] whatever that's made to where it it
[1:02:00] comes and closes and locks down to where
[1:02:02] they're on their ankles to where they
[1:02:05] can't get up they can't move they then
[1:02:07] and then they book their hands in chains
[1:02:11] so here they were laying up against this
[1:02:15] wall and it was it was a dark time for
[1:02:20] him
[1:02:22] they had been preaching in the name of
[1:02:24] the Lord and now all the sudden they had
[1:02:26] been beat first of all stripped of their
[1:02:30] clothes and then beat and if that wasn't
[1:02:34] enough they throw them in prison and
[1:02:36] locked them fast now
[1:02:41] if there have been some of the
[1:02:43] Christians from today they'd have been
[1:02:45] thinking why did this happen to me but
[1:02:51] Paul and Silas there was something
[1:02:54] different about them they knew that no
[1:02:57] matter where they were they were in
[1:02:59] God's hands and in the will of God they
[1:03:04] didn't know why they were in prison they
[1:03:06] didn't know but they but they were there
[1:03:10] and so the Bible says about midnight at
[1:03:14] midnight they began to sing hallelujah
[1:03:19] headed our Twitter at a time when it
[1:03:21] looked like things couldn't get no
[1:03:24] better and it looked like it couldn't
[1:03:26] get any worse they began to sing
[1:03:33] and following god if you can take it you
[1:03:36] can make it going through the trials and
[1:03:43] things that you face if you can take it
[1:03:45] you can make it and they begin to sing
[1:03:48] at a time when and you know there's
[1:03:50] times in church when we can't hardly get
[1:03:53] the people to feel like singing in there
[1:03:54] not in stocks and bonds they're not
[1:03:56] locked up they had been beaten but here
[1:04:00] they were in this condition and all of a
[1:04:02] sudden they begin to sing and worship
[1:04:04] God and praise God and we know from
[1:04:09] reading the Scriptures why they were
[1:04:11] there they were there because there was
[1:04:15] a jailer and his house that needed
[1:04:18] saving and the only way they were going
[1:04:21] to get to talk to that jailer was if
[1:04:24] they were in jail with him so they had
[1:04:27] to go where he was so something had to
[1:04:31] take place to put them there and then
[1:04:35] when they begin to sing at midnight they
[1:04:38] earth begin to quake and the jail began
[1:04:41] to shake and the stocks came off their
[1:04:44] legs and the chains fell off the hands
[1:04:47] and the jailer became fearful for he
[1:04:51] thought the prisoners would escape and
[1:04:53] that would mean his life so he was gonna
[1:04:55] take his own life
[1:04:56] and Baal said stay your hand don't take
[1:04:59] your life we're all here
[1:05:03] and that moved on that jailers heart and
[1:05:07] he said what must I do to be saved
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:14] they said be baptized in the name of the
[1:05:18] Lord Jesus and thou in thy old house
[1:05:21] shall be saved
[1:05:26] why were they there for him
[1:05:29] many times we get into situations and
[1:05:32] and as humans we might think of wonder
[1:05:34] why does this happen to me why was I'm
[1:05:37] why am I here this job is terrible why
[1:05:41] am I on this job there might be somebody
[1:05:44] there that needs sane there might be
[1:05:48] somebody there you need to witness to
[1:05:51] I'm in this grocery line it seems like
[1:05:54] they're taking all day to get me through
[1:05:56] why am i standing here you don't know
[1:05:59] there might be somebody that you can say
[1:06:02] something to God puts us in situations
[1:06:07] not only to test us but he puts us in
[1:06:10] situations to be able to reach friends
[1:06:13] we've got to find the last seed
[1:06:16] [Applause]
[1:06:27] in the bible there was a woman by the
[1:06:31] name of Naomi and she had two sons and
[1:06:38] her husband and then there come a famine
[1:06:42] in the land and they went to the land of
[1:06:46] mold
[1:06:47] to try to sustain themselves and her
[1:06:51] husband died and her two sons took wives
[1:06:56] and they lived there a while
[1:07:01] and then the two sons died there was
[1:07:06] Naomi left with just her and her do
[1:07:09] daughter-in-law
[1:07:11] and she told them said look
[1:07:15] there's no hope here I couldn't can't
[1:07:19] have no more children my husband's gone
[1:07:20] there's there's no one to take you go
[1:07:23] back to your people
[1:07:27] though the one turn turn law is done go
[1:07:30] back to your people
[1:07:33] and then Ruth says those famous words
[1:07:36] that we quote we hear em at weddings
[1:07:39] sometimes whether thou goest I will go
[1:07:44] whether their lodgest I will Lodge thy
[1:07:49] people shall be my people and thy God
[1:07:53] shall be my god
[1:07:57] so they journey on and Naomi hears that
[1:08:02] there is bread for the children in Judah
[1:08:06] and so they travel to Judah and when
[1:08:10] they get there they
[1:08:15] Naomi says that she's not gonna rest
[1:08:19] until she finds someone for Ruth
[1:08:23] and says there is a near kinsman here
[1:08:29] and he can redeem the land the belong to
[1:08:35] Naomi and take Ruth for a wife
[1:08:41] so she instructs roots said after your
[1:08:45] gathering in his field said go and lay
[1:08:49] down wait till he lays down
[1:08:52] and once he lays down you lay at his
[1:08:56] feet
[1:08:58] and then wait and see what he tells you
[1:09:02] and so root did is her mother Lloyd told
[1:09:05] her she went and watched for Boaz and
[1:09:11] after bull has had had had food and
[1:09:14] drink then he goes to lay down and as he
[1:09:17] lays down and goes to sleep
[1:09:19] then Ruth comes in and lays herself
[1:09:21] at his feet
[1:09:24] and at midnight
[1:09:28] boas realizes there's a woman laying his
[1:09:32] feet
[1:09:34] I realized this friends and now it's
[1:09:39] just Ruth and Naomi and no hope for her
[1:09:42] from Naomi but at midnight Boaz wakes up
[1:09:48] and realized there's a woman laying at
[1:09:51] my feet and so Boaz comes awake and
[1:09:56] asked her what she's doing and she says
[1:10:00] throw your skirt over me
[1:10:05] hallelujah the Almighty takes us under
[1:10:10] his wing I don't know the gift you know
[1:10:19] God could come in a body to Abraham
[1:10:24] and talk to Abraham
[1:10:32] God could come in a body and be the
[1:10:36] fourth man in the fire
[1:10:40] but he had to be born like you and I in
[1:10:45] order to become our Redeemer he had to
[1:10:50] be born like all mankind in order to be
[1:10:54] our kinsman
[1:11:01] and so in the morning just before
[1:11:05] morning she rises up and leaves so that
[1:11:08] no one would know she was there
[1:11:11] and Boas goes out and he's going to
[1:11:14] redeem this property that belongs to
[1:11:17] Naomi and he says there's a nearer
[1:11:20] kinsman than me and he said first must
[1:11:24] give him a chance so he goes and he
[1:11:26] speaks to him and says you need to buy
[1:11:31] this property of Naomi's and in doing so
[1:11:35] you must take Ruth to be your wife
[1:11:39] and so this man says I can't do it
[1:11:44] unless I
[1:11:47] Ammar my own inheritance
[1:11:51] and so he said but you go ahead and do
[1:11:54] it
[1:11:56] and so boaz proceeds to go forth with it
[1:11:59] now I've read the scripture over and
[1:12:01] over and over and I can't figure out
[1:12:03] whose shoe it was
[1:12:05] but somebody took off a shoe and handed
[1:12:08] it to their neighbor according to the
[1:12:10] scriptures and it was a sign that they
[1:12:13] were going to redeem be a kinsman
[1:12:17] redeemer and so this exchanging of the
[1:12:22] shoe takes place and then boy it says
[1:12:25] let it be known that I am purchasing
[1:12:28] this property that belongs to nil me and
[1:12:31] in doing so I am purchasing Ruth to be
[1:12:34] my wife
[1:12:40] somebody had to redeem us not only that
[1:12:45] he had to redeem some property it had to
[1:12:50] redeem the earth because it had fallen
[1:12:54] into the wrong hands so there was a
[1:12:57] price that had to be paid it had God had
[1:13:02] to send someone to buy it back
[1:13:09] and the only one they could find worthy
[1:13:11] was the Lion of the tribe of Judah and
[1:13:19] John turned the Bible says to see and
[1:13:22] beheld it was a lamb as if it had been
[1:13:26] slain friends I'm going to tell you
[1:13:28] something Jesus Christ is a lamb for us
[1:13:32] and he is a lion for us
[1:13:37] [Applause]
[1:13:46] the Bible in the Bible Jesus gives us a
[1:13:50] parable
[1:13:51] and says that there were 10 virgin
[1:13:58] and there were five wise and five
[1:14:02] foolish and the reason that was fired
[1:14:04] foolishness because they didn't bring
[1:14:06] any oil
[1:14:08] for their lands and so they were waiting
[1:14:14] and you realize this is a tight
[1:14:19] of the coming of the Lord it's a type of
[1:14:23] the Lord coming to get his bride and I'm
[1:14:28] going to tell you something friends
[1:14:29] we're living in a dark time we're living
[1:14:35] in a time when this world is almost that
[1:14:38] is darkness
[1:14:41] when the Prophet was here he spoke about
[1:14:45] a clock that they have up in Chicago I
[1:14:49] believe is called the Doomsday Clock and
[1:14:53] it measures according to the the
[1:14:58] likelihood of destruction by nuclear
[1:15:01] weapons
[1:15:03] and at the time brother Brenham said he
[1:15:06] said they said that it was three minutes
[1:15:09] to midnight
[1:15:12] but he said now I believe it maybe one
[1:15:16] minute to midnight so I don't knows that
[1:15:21] clock it kind of moves back and forth
[1:15:23] Thursday as the arms race moves
[1:15:27] I don't know how close it is to midnight
[1:15:31] but anyway we're very close to midnight
[1:15:39] or at a dark time and at midnight the
[1:15:44] cry went out behold the bridegroom
[1:15:48] cometh go ye out to meet him
[1:15:54] and those that had oil in their lamps
[1:15:57] trimmed their lamps
[1:15:59] so that they would burn brighter so they
[1:16:04] go out to meet the bridegroom
[1:16:07] and the other five by their fire had
[1:16:12] burned out
[1:16:15] and they said give us some of your
[1:16:18] autumn
[1:16:21] that we may put in our laps and we know
[1:16:26] the oil represents the Holy Ghost
[1:16:31] and from that parable we see that only
[1:16:33] those that have the Holy Ghost are the
[1:16:36] ones that's going to go in the rapture
[1:16:37] the ones that's going to be able to meet
[1:16:39] the bridegroom and they said give us
[1:16:43] some of your oil they said not so lest
[1:16:48] we not have enough but you've got to go
[1:16:51] buy it from those that sell it
[1:16:55] look friends you can't give somebody the
[1:16:58] Holy Ghost they've got to get it the way
[1:17:02] you got it and there's coming a day
[1:17:08] when the last one will receive the Holy
[1:17:10] Ghost and when the last one that last
[1:17:14] seed receives the Holy Ghost then
[1:17:16] friends the cry is going to go out it's
[1:17:20] going to be midnight
[1:17:24] metaphorically speaking of this world
[1:17:26] it's going to be midnight and the cry is
[1:17:30] going to go forth and the dead in Christ
[1:17:34] are going to rise and those that are
[1:17:38] live and remain are going to be changed
[1:17:40] and friends we're going to rise up out
[1:17:43] of the darkness of this world
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:55] there's a young man in the Bible by the
[1:17:58] name of you tokus
[1:18:02] I don't know what was going on in his
[1:18:06] life
[1:18:07] I don't know what was taking place the
[1:18:11] Bible doesn't tell us it doesn't tell us
[1:18:13] what he might have been going through
[1:18:16] what he had been facing but you know
[1:18:20] that as a follower of Jesus he had to be
[1:18:24] facing some trials he had to be facing
[1:18:26] some tests there had to be situations
[1:18:30] that he was in at one time or another
[1:18:32] which he had to call upon the Lord there
[1:18:35] had to be some time some dark times in
[1:18:38] his life because it happens to those
[1:18:43] that follow the Lord because Satan
[1:18:48] brings the darkness to try to turn you
[1:18:51] around Satan brings the darkness on and
[1:18:55] God allows you to try to hinder you in
[1:18:58] your walk to try to hinder you in your
[1:19:02] faith and this young man was sitting in
[1:19:06] church
[1:19:09] and they were preaching
[1:19:12] and about midnight he sails out of the
[1:19:18] loss and hit the floor dead
[1:19:27] that a dark time had definitely come in
[1:19:30] his life
[1:19:34] because I don't know the Bible doesn't
[1:19:37] tell us
[1:19:38] his his account between him and God
[1:19:42] where he how he was he doesn't tell us
[1:19:46] whether he was ready to go or not I
[1:19:48] don't know
[1:19:50] but this thing I dunno Paul went down
[1:19:54] and laid himself on the young man and
[1:19:56] said his life is in him still and the
[1:19:59] young man came back to life one minute
[1:20:06] after midnight he was back alive again
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:18] was one time that all was bound as a
[1:20:24] prisoner
[1:20:32] and he was on his way to go and stand
[1:20:34] before Caesar because you know Paul said
[1:20:43] I'm a I'm a citizen I'm a Roman citizen
[1:20:46] I have the right to appear before Caesar
[1:20:48] and so they were taking him and he was
[1:20:52] bound in chains
[1:20:54] and they had him and many other
[1:20:57] prisoners aboard this ship
[1:20:59] and a great storm arose
[1:21:08] and it looked like that they weren't
[1:21:10] going to be able to make it through this
[1:21:12] storm it was taking the ship
[1:21:16] and the ship was at the mercy of the
[1:21:21] waters of the storm
[1:21:24] and where they were sailing at there
[1:21:28] were Islands and different things but
[1:21:31] there was rocks that would tear that
[1:21:34] ship apart so it looked like all hope
[1:21:38] was gone
[1:21:41] and then during the night angel award
[1:21:47] came and appeared to Paul he said Paul
[1:21:51] you are going to appear before Caesar
[1:21:56] and no one aboard this ship is gonna die
[1:22:02] but here's the thing
[1:22:05] they've got to stay with the ship and
[1:22:10] the Bible says that they were the men of
[1:22:15] the ship were about to abandon the
[1:22:17] prisoners and they're about to put the
[1:22:19] boats into the water I boots it into
[1:22:21] water and abandon the ship and Paul
[1:22:24] calls him and does him don't don't do
[1:22:27] that where the angel Lord appeared to me
[1:22:29] this night and told me that we'll all
[1:22:32] survive but we've got to stay with the
[1:22:37] ship I'm gonna tell you something
[1:22:41] friends I haven't I have watched in the
[1:22:44] church for I pastor and I've seen other
[1:22:47] churches and there's people that are
[1:22:49] abandoning this ship but you've got to
[1:22:52] stay with the ship brother branham never
[1:22:59] said God ordained tape recorders to take
[1:23:02] you and they'll get you ready for the
[1:23:04] rapture but he said God ordained pastors
[1:23:09] to lead you through together stay with
[1:23:14] your pastor
[1:23:22] the Bible says that at midnight
[1:23:26] behold they saw an island and they tried
[1:23:33] to turn the ship toward that island
[1:23:37] and the ship was coming upon the island
[1:23:40] and rocks started tearing it apart
[1:23:49] but every man made it some of them on
[1:23:54] pieces of the ship as it was torn apart
[1:23:57] but everyone was safe
[1:24:03] and you imagine as the Sun rose them
[1:24:07] there on that island on the we will call
[1:24:10] the beach of that island
[1:24:14] and just a few hours before they had
[1:24:18] been in a hopeless situation but God had
[1:24:26] sent an angel and had come on the scene
[1:24:29] and had brought salvation to all those
[1:24:33] they were aboard
[1:24:36] in other words they were saved from
[1:24:39] dying
[1:24:48] David says at midnight I will rise and
[1:24:51] give thanks unto thee because of thy
[1:24:54] righteous judgments
[1:25:00] now I don't know
[1:25:03] what you may be going through I don't
[1:25:08] know what you maybe face but I believe

[1:47:18] firstborn son with a death angel passing
[1:47:25] soon it was hard to fall asleep but one
[1:47:31] little lamb sat in his mind as he lay
