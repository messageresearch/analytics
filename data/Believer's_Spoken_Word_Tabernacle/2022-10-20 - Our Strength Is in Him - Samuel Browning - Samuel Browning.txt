people amen I'm glad that he comes aren't you amen so good to be gathered with you this evening we just want to turn our attention and our hearts to the word of the Lord as we prepare to look into his word this evening let's just want to approach him in a word of prayer here and you have a need on your heart just make it known to him God is mindful he's proven over and over again he's mindful of our needs and maybe the answer we what we think is the answer God's the one who's the answer he's the one who has the answer sometimes the very things that you know brother Brown took a situation when he was out there hunting this brother had had a dream the brother thought it was a little jokey but Ram tells us in Christ the mystery he said come to find out the dream that he had was the very answer to the situation with his home he said sometimes the things that we think can seem a little this way but God is the answer and just in his presence a man cannot make these things known to us but in his presence and I think we're gathered together tonight as believers just expecting God to come on the scene just to move Among Us in a way that he knows he knows our needs the Bible said that the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout all the Earth even at times when you feel like that maybe your prayer Lord is my prayer even being heard you know brother Brandon would stand there on the on the platform and he said I I see you kneeling by the side of the bed and and this is what you're praying and he said what it is he said I'm hearing your prayer in a land called prayer a land called prayer so our prayers are not just going up and hitting hitting the ceiling but our prayers are going in a land called prayer Before the Throne of God and God is mindful you know God doesn't let one prayer pass by as a matter of fact even of the prayers that's been offered down through the ages in regarding for Redemption they've just been piled up they're in a great sensor and one of these days it's going to be poured out God answers every prayer he answers every prayer every prayer let's just go before him Heavenly Father Lord we're standing Lord in a wonderful place tonight in your presence Lord under the Precious Blood of the Lamb and Lord how thankful we are for our sacrifice we're thankful for that precious blood we're thankful for the life that was wrapped in that blood cell that has been released oh God Upon Us Lord as the worshiper God we we recognize we were included in that sacrifice Lord we're the reason of that sacrifice we believe that Lord because your Grace has made that known to his Lord and how we thank you Father for the washing of Water by the word Lord as we stand tonight we are standing here as Believers the Lord just with the reality that you answer every prayer Lord you answer every prayer Lord we know Lord there's there's sometimes the Lord where there's things that we could pray like when Abraham prayed about Ishmael well you couldn't do that but you ministered to Abraham Lord in that way that God you're The God Who fulfills your word not according to how we're looking at it to be fulfilled Ishmael was not the one that you had in mind it was Isaac Lord and so father your faithfulness was to guide and direct Abraham even in that moment Lord father you answer every prayer now may you just come Lord minister to our hearts Lord may we step aside tonight's speaker and congregation and may you step down among us as you did on the road of Emmaus Lord and just speak to our hearts tonight in a very personal way you know Lord you know the thoughts of our hearts Lord and we just commit Our Lives to you and ask that you would come Lord take control now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen Amen in Psalms 84. amen just want to remind you and ask that you would just keep us in prayer this weekend we leave out tomorrow there for Logan Ohio would be with brother just not grass and the Saints there for meetings beginning on uh tomorrow night and we have Friday Saturday and Sunday three services there to speak just ask that God will just move Among Us in a very special way we need him and we just are looking for him will you do that I don't take that for granted I had like two amens out of there amen that really helps amen will you be in prayer amen be in prayer for those meetings brother Alex will be here Amen to men stand in on Sunday and uh certainly appreciate that in Psalms 84 and I just want to read a few verses of scripture here tonight laughs here it is it says how admeable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of hosts look how David would write regarding the courts of the Lord how admirable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of hosts my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh cryeth out praise for the Living God yea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow and nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars O Lord of hosts my king and my God blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will still they will be still praising thee Salah blessed is the man whose strength is in thee whose heart are the ways of them we're just going to ask the Lord to bless the reading of the word we'll just stop there this evening you may have your seats I want to just speak here tonight on just a little thought we've been looking at appropriate responses I want to just speak here tonight just take a little portion from that scripture on our strength is in him yeah I want to just really dwell upon that just that scripture here tonight because this this whole chapter if you have an opportunity to read it no doubt you've read it before it's been one of those chapters that for me I've been drawn to for so many times and come back and just meditate on and I find myself in studies just keep on coming back to it and everything continues to tie back in and and then as I just looking at this you know Charles Spurgeon how many of you know Charles Spurgeon there's a devotional and Charles Spurgeon was just uh they called him a prince of preachers Charles purgeon was just I just enjoy his devotionals too and Charles Spurgeon would call this Psalm the pearl of the Psalms and when you look we can see this and we're just going to move just a little bit here this evening in verse 5 of how that this what a what a word of comfort and how that God's word does bring us comfort and blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them and the the reality of how that it is written when it says in whose heart is the ways of them it's actually to be read in this manner blessed is the man whose strength is in you whose heart is set on pilgrimage so this life that you and I that we know and and this is all that as far as that we have known as far as seeing tasting and feeling so forth outside of the contact of the holy spirit with our lives we then recognize that this life is not our destiny but our but our destiny is of that of the new heavens and new earth our destiny is is not confined to these mortal bodies this is not our end even as the Bible would say that this this body that we you and I are in is not our inheritance but it is our possession we possess it by the grace of God and so when we look at this and through the Psalms of how that David and I think how Deva would write and you can look at this in many places of the Psalms even if you just take the word house and you look it up in the Psalms and just look at how many times that you find David speaking of his desire to dwell in the house of the Lord oh how my heart even as we read here it fainted for the house of the Lord if we read on further in the scripture David would describe of the pleasure it is to be in the house of the Lord in that even if I'm just a doorkeeper it would be better to be at your house as a doorkeeper than dwell in the tents of the wicked it would be better as David could say it would be better one day in your presence is better than a thousand days elsewhere David was one who was locked in on being in the house of God it showed that there was a longing within David that David knew there was a place that I can dwell that I don't have to ever leave it was the spirit of Christ that was even announcing in David's life there is coming a place where the believer can dwell and never have to depart any longer there's a place where we can dwell in the very presence of God and when I think of that how he would be wrote In This Way blessed is the man whose strength is in you the man who finds his strength in God whose heart is set on pilgrimage that that this life is not what defines who I am but what defines who I am it comes from another realm this life is is not what defines me in this in this nationality ethnicity or whatever my defining of who I am it comes from the Heavenly this is only a temporary dwelling I don't even know how many months how the space of time that's all in God's hands but in the meantime this is a pilgrimage can I say it tonight your trial is not your destiny your trial is not your Bode but the trial that you're in is only a part a fragment a peace and my new part of the pilgrimage that we are on to the other side so we are we do not as pilgrims of God we do not rely on ourself no no we do not rely on the on the world or the strength that it could that we could uh seek to try to have or relief in that way but we are as the Bible says pilgrims and strangers yeah once the spirit of God has alerted and come into our life by this by the whole by the the new birth we are pilgrims and strangers here upon this Earth and we recognize that the house of God that we're speaking of the house of God is not just these walls right here this is a place that God has given us together and to be refreshed and it's true every time we come here it's to be an individual meeting between us and God but that's really how every day is supposed to be it's an individual meeting between us and God and yet God would provide for us a place that you and I can come and gather that we can then receive strength from him and even encouragement from one another and this is God's desire for as he said that he would desire that we would assemble ourselves together knowing that there is a strength that comes through the body you realize brother that when we come together as Believers he said there is an assembling of the godhead bodily there are licks of fire that are coming together because we are not just a natural people we are a supernatural people we are led by the angel of the Lord the pillar of power is Among Us God has divided himself into his vessels and when we come together it is the more of the body that God had bodily the pillar of power that is gathered right here we receive strength from one another is that right amen I know Satan's desire is to you know he he wants to always put us on an island to ourselves and sometimes the way Satan wants to do is to de-emphasize the need for the body but God never de-emphasized that sometimes you and I may not see it but remember we're not Natural Born we're not people that are limited to just our senses if we are we are among people most miserable but we recognize even when you come here to the house of God you can come in with a great difficulty a great problem or something that's on your heart but yet there's an expectation in your heart that beyond my doubts Beyond every hindrance I believe that God is going to speak to me if God has to take the man of God from off of his notes whatever it is I God is going to meet my need oh when we can come in that way we find that we receive strength from almighty God we are not here as Spectators in this service we are here to receive strength from El Shady eyes glory be to God and so in our pilgrimage right here we're just passing through blessed is the man in in blessed is that man in whose strength is in thee not in the world not in what this has to offer but in thee whose hearts in whose heart are the ways of them so we are a pilgrim and dwelling in the house of God the house of God As We Know is the body of Jesus Christ is that right God came down and Tabernacle in our midst and here he was restoring what was what Adam fell from and what rightfully belonged to you and I and he made a way that we can come in to our inheritance to receive the in her in Earnest of it of the holy spirit that ties us back in to our Eternal inheritance and here the body of Jesus Christ is the house of God which the body is the word and how do we get in there there's one way to get into it there's there's the secret way and it's First Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we are all baptized into that body of the word so where is Christ's dwelling Christ is not dwelling somewhere far off he's dwelling right in the midst of his church can I preacher a moment brother man talks about entertaining strangers and he said how do you know that that brother or that sister sitting right next to you tonight he says there is Jesus veiled in that life and he's there to minister to your need it's not the strength of your brother or sister but it's the strength of almighty God thank you Hallelujah it ain't just in a pasture come on that's reverse nickelodeonism every time people want to call call out preachers on Nickelodeon what about reverse nickelodeonism what about what about people wanting to put everything in the Pulpit here we don't want everything in the Pulpit he's God of the entire congregation he's proud of the entire body are you with me he's just as much God for you as he is for me whoa oh Hallelujah here we are in journey and the Lord Jesus would tell you and I let not your heart be troubled Hallelujah if you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I'd go prepare a place for you so I'm a pilgrim and my heart gets set on this goal in my father's house are many Dwelling Places in my father's house is my theophany in my father's house that's the promised land of the hour that we are called to this is the Third Exodus and it's on and this is the promise that we have before us we're not moving without a promise you see without a promise you have nothing to look to you but you have to have a promise what is a promise it's a goal it's something you can expect you can look to you can draw from and we have a promise in my father's house are many mansions that's my goal that's my objective I know where I come from and I know what I'm going that's right what do you say this is not my final resting place this trial is not my destiny [Applause] Hallelujah when you're on a trip and you have to stop for a restroom break or to get you know stretch your legs or to get a bite to eat wherever you stop kids when they're little are we there yet are we there yet maybe sometimes as adults will ask that are we there yet because we sure like to be there yeah right right right our legs are about cramped up we say let me out I'll run and I'll beat you there but you see those are just stopping points places along the way so trials are not our destiny they're only places along the way but our destiny is the other side I've come from God I'm going back to God you see the power of a promise in front of you how did Joshua and Caleb face those spies they had a promise made by a promise keeping God and they saw that promise is greater and stronger than the Giants that's standing in front of me they drew strength from that promise that's why you've got to have a promise you've got to have a promise in every situation of life when turmoil and everything is going wrong and going the route you've got to have a promise that you're drawing from because situations in life are not always going to go our way and they don't have to go away sometimes God's got to bring us to places and to get us to a place that we realize I'm trying to get my own way in this Hallelujah amen we better just move on tonight look at this this going somewhere First Peter chapter 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead so now this is as he said have begotten us again so here is we are partakers of that Resurrection we we are ply takers because as he was dead and there's a lot forevermore that's where you and I stand as Believers when the Holy Spirit has come how was once dead but now I'm alive by the resurrection power of Jesus Christ he has begotten us not me but he has begotten us unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead so this is not a dead hope this is not a hopeless hope this is a true living expectation verse 4 to an inheritance what have we been begotten to to an inheritance Incorruptible undefiled and fadeth not away sure is not talking about this natural body Trenton talking about our human spirit either so where is this inheritance that's incorruptible where is it that it's undefiled and it does not fade away does not age nothing it stands within Perfection where is this reserved in heaven for you not here but reserved in heaven for us don't you see when we can look at this and have a promise that is before us then no matter what we go through in life we have a place that we can look and we can see I don't know what's going on here I don't know what's happening right now and even though I'm in the midst of sorrow and mourning and grief and on and on that is going on but yet I have a promise before me and what happens that promise you have before you is what you draw strength from to endure the things you're going through now is that right now remember brother Branham when he spoke about this in the adoption series remember he was talking to his wife and he's talking about you know I just want to I just want to go ahead and go on home I just want to go ahead and go on home remember what the Holy Spirit spoke to him and said are you trying to dodge your trials you trying to dodge him you want the easy way out just go on you're trying to dodge him and what brother Graham said I said Lord forgive me who's whose flesh wouldn't want to dodge problems y'all like when things come up and put a kink in the host I don't do you I don't think anybody does right all of a sudden here you are cooking a nice steak on the grill gas goes out anybody like that like whoa no you're of all times the gas can be fine on hot dogs I'd have been just fine no you wouldn't if you'd have been complaining then too right because of what were things we look at of is inconvenience is that right but this is reserved in heaven for us who are what kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time now let me just say it like this uh let me let me just skip just a few places here so I can deal with this on on the strength of almighty God and you find that how that that Peter would go on and he would say wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold Temptation manifold means various comes in various forms right manifold if need be now you and I would never say Lord I need a I need a trial if you do you need prayer for even asking that see God allots the trials based on what we have need of is that right that the trial of your faith now notice what's being tried not your body not your spirit your faith our body will fail our human spirit will fail but remember what Jesus said to Peter I have prayed that thy Faith failed not Oh Glory being much more precious than of gold that perishes so what's greater than any type of gold your faith though it your faith be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now God is not standing back and God looking at brother Joshua and saying wow I didn't realize that laid within you no God knows it all the time God knows that God's Not Looking Back and say whoa I didn't know that was in brown I didn't know there was in Ray wow I didn't know that was in Rita wow no no God knows what's there he knows what's there now remember remember in order to bring that out God and he has to actually bring that from what's within this Earth because out of this Earth there is nothing out of this Earth that God is trying to bring out but it's the very character of Christ that God wants to bring on display in our life now think of it here is to be into the praise and glory of almighty God now notice in verse 8 whom having not seen you love isn't that powerful we've not seen him I'm not seeing the nail scarred hands I'm not seeing the Lord Jesus the physical Corporal body but I'm going to pray but I love him I love him amen because to recognize that the same one that dwelt there the same Jesus has returned back that same life and moved and made himself known to you and me by the Holy Spirit through his word and there is a love affair whom though I have not seen you have not seen we love him we love him in whom though now you see him not wow yet believe it yeah well that does away with anybody from Missouri don't it because Missouri is I got to see it to believe it the truth but you understand now you see him not you don't see him physically but yet you believe him what gives that quality it's faith you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your soul so receiving the end of our faith even the salvation of our souls it speaks there is a pilgrimage there is a journey there's a maturing of our faith amen there's a growing of our faith do you realize that our love is even to grow now the love of God remember has Paul would admonish the Believers that we would abound in the love of God that our faith would grow oh my now think of this how God would would come and God would permit job to be tested and tried remember how Satan spoke against job but I want you to think about this strength when Satan Satan even had a testimony after all things around job were taken away and Satan stood there in the prince of God and said this guy is holding fast his integrity God made Satan defy in his presence he hadn't Satan had made a bet with God I think brother Cadre had made a statement like that he there was a debate going on and then here in this moment Satan had to testify he still holding his integrity then Albert you know Satan comes and says let me touch his body because all I got to do is touch his body if I touch his body that's it he's going to curse you because man will give anything for his life well that's if he hasn't found another life if he hadn't found another source are you with me so Satan you know Satan is looking at when he's coming to give test and trial Satan is not coming in on job as a helpless being Satan is coming in there with the full intent that I am going to cause this man to turn around and curse God but what's Satan underestimated what's the strength that was in the blood of the sacrifice he underestimated the power of divine revelation and God allowed him to test it God wasn't worried God didn't take out life insurance policies on this come on now because he knew Satan is looking at the flesh he's looking at everything that's around but he's underestimating the strength that lays within the revelation of the blood of the sacrifice oh my like my brother Cadre put it last week as well as we were looking at that job was not his strength he was strength was not that in his cattle or his uh you know all the oxen and you know one of his children his strength was not in all of those things around him his strength was not in his own health his strength was not in his life his strength was in his sacrifice the country I think used a word instead of strength but you know what it means you use the word connected but that's where his strength was or by the time you know why is that important because if your strength is in something else you let something else be touched and your strength is gone if your strength is in your bank account uh oh better watch out if that bank account goes then your strength will go and as your strength goes it'll manifest itself in your life are you hearing me now I'm talking about the strength of almighty God we're living in a time in an hour that when we look at this of how even his wife would say to him thus thou still retain thine Integrity curse God and die now think of it Jones got a strength here he's retaining he's holding but it isn't job's strength it's the strength of God that has a hold of his life are you with me that's the strength of God that has a hold upon his life because job would say it like this let me refer to this in Job chapter 6 verse 11 when the first one begins to speak to him I believe it's a file as a life as when he begins to speak to him and you know it starts to accuse job and everything else after seven days of looking at him and job was so bad they didn't even recognize they just sat there for seven days and didn't say nothing because they didn't even know what to say they looked at him they couldn't even recognize him to be job if job hadn't been sitting at job's address they'd have never recognized him that's what the Bible says they want to recognize me if they would have passed him out of Target they'd have walked on Vine but here's a man they have to testify to this you've been a one who's ministered strength to others yes that's powerful you know that don't you you wow what was that about Joe oh well Samuel job but just a good old boy nice deeper than a good old boy because sometimes a good old boy will only do good old things as long as their backs being scratched but if their back ain't being scratched it ain't a good old boy it's a sour old bat boy but Joe was more than a he had a strength of the sacrifice and you know what the meaning the sacrifice did it made him aware that there was one that was standing for him and it broke it pushed job to a place of service he ministered under the authority of that sacrifice when he spoke to others and maybe text Brother Carlos on the phone and said brother I'm praying for you keep pressing the battle Brother Ray I'm praying for you what was it he was ministering strength from the sacrifice that he was under oh you say brother Samuel my text don't mean anything why don't you tell that lion Devil he's a liar and get off my shoulder I'm a part of the body of Jesus Christ and if God inspires my heart to call a brother call a sister send him a text send them a card that I'm going to take that as the unction of the Holy Spirit and that's just as powerful that's walking on the water that's just as great as laying hands on the sick and they shall recover for those words are coming from the sacrifice and it calls us Devils to scatter I'm going there amen Glory Jehovah said concerning his own strength brother Brian he looked at himself and he turns around and asks them in job 6 11 what is my strength what is my strength that I should hope and what is my end that I should prolong my life remember job's in a place right now of he's not cursed God you can never make him do that you can't move him off his sacrifice amen but in the midst of this right here I won't look at it tonight but in the midst of it right here job is looking all around him oh Lord I wish the day had never been that they had said a man child was born now I won't ask you to raise your hands of things that you went through and whatever more but you wish Lord have mercy I wish I was already gone I wish I wasn't going through this come on now we all do that listen your strength is not your flesh even though job could say that he did not hinder or stop or annul the Covenant power of the faith of God in his life [Music] Hallelujah what is my strength verse 12 is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh of brass now not only has he went through all this but then you've got somebody calling you up and saying yeah you know what sister Stephanie if you haven't done this and done this and done that and done that you're about ready to open the door and say get out of here because that's if that's encouragement don't need it right but here he is he's looking at his own life strength my strength is not the strength of stones I'm not my flesh it's not made of brass so this strength you see as job himself was standing there and think about this for just a moment when God was standing there and speaking to Satan and testifying of job he was not testifying when he said that job is a perfect man he's a man of integrity a man that is skeweth evil he was not speaking of the natural DNA of job because there is no flesh back in glory in the presence of God and let me just tell you something God wasn't up there bragging on job's flesh God don't brag on your flesh God don't grab on my flesh it's not the flesh that he's bragging on what God is seeing he's seeing the reflection of the Revelation in John's life you know what God is seeing he's seeing God he's seeing himself reflected by the sinless perfect one who do you think God sees in your life in my life not me he sees himself remember when Cain came with his works came with his good fruits God looked upon it and he saw Cain when Abel came with the lamb the Revelation cotton upon it and he saw himself he did not see Abel he saw himself glory be that thought if divine revelation moving in our lives can cause God to see himself or what it ought to do for our lives that we then can look and say I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God foreign so the strength of the Lord is not an Earthly means right you can try to satisfy with perfectly things but it's natural it's not the strength of the lord it's not from Earthly means it's supernatural it's steadfast in the midst of the trial and of the test of life let me say this to you everything going right in our life it's not what should be the measure whether we are Joy or Pleasant to be around let me repeat that again everything going around in our life our environment you know what's around us the cattle the this the that and sabians came this way child dance our joy what about the same if I could just get the cows all eaten if I could just get this if I could just you know what that is that's you that's you and God said there's some selfishness that's got to be reduced because I am not going to bow down before your wants amen oh that's good sometimes we have to look and we've got we feel like we get this we get that we get this bowl and this is all set up praise God I'll have joy that's not Joy that's worldly Joy because it's still under your orchestration well somebody help me preach amen you could say out show me don't worry we're all in this together John 16 33 Jesus said these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be a good cheer I have overcome the world now he didn't say be a good cheer for I'm going to take away all tribulation I'm going to take away all trials all tests right but he said in me where's my where's my peace going to be Lord in me it's going to be in me that's where you're going to find your pieces in me so finding our peace is finding the source of peace himself one who settles us the Tranquility the peace well in the world now in the world does he remove us from the world no we are in the world we're not of them we've been birthed from above we have received the experience the life the spirit of that other land and it is the other land that's reflected in us it's just like if you were to go to another country I really don't matter what you are what you look like you go to another country even though you might be of the same maybe nationality they'll tell whether you're Americanized or not they can tell they know by the way you conduct yourself or you carry yourself because what this is the land where you live is that right you you know what I'm talking about so notice God himself he wasn't that he's going to take us out from tribulations this is when David was right blessed is the man in whose strength whose strength is in the Lord for the ways of them are in his heart so David was not saying that God is going to take us out of the world but rather that God gives us strength in our pilgrimage because this is not my final resting place I've got an appointment Isaiah 33 5 the Lord is exalted now notice this the Lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness so the Lord is exalted if we can ever say that in this time the message that God has sent to you and I in this hour has exalted the Lord sure above every disease above every condition the Lord has been exalted as what the mighty conqueror the Victorious Christ amen the Lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high and he hath filled Zion with what discernment and righteousness and wisdom and knowledge notice this verse wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times thy what times not just one trial times every season of your life the seasons will change from teenager 20 to 30 to 40 50 and 60 and we keep going now times will change right times change in our bodies right but no matter the times wisdom and knowledge shall be thy stability it's what will stabilize you and strength of Salvation which is Deliverance how many are thankful he's still a deliverer I'm still thankful he's saving aren't you oh yeah brother Sam I'm glad that God's saving Souls I'm glad about that too I'm real happy but I'm also glad that he's still my savior in the midst of a trial I'm glad he's my savior when I've been sick I'm grateful for saving strength of the Lord I'm glad that maybe when I've been perplexed or down I don't know what to do I'm glad he is the strength of my salvation he's my stability now notice when we see this brother random was saying like this and looking at the Unseen he said when a man wants catches that vision of the invisible God and knows that he's always present there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking you catch what he said when he catches that Vision that's great vision of the invisible God and knows that he's always present there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking I hope you catch this it isn't that that man's thinking is always perfect but he's got something that'll stabilize him when thoughts come he's got something that'll anchor him because thoughts can come but there's something that stabilizes him what is that something is here he's with me he said he never leave me nor forsake me Lord be to God it stabilizes his actions in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen yet by promise see see the power of the promise made real to you even in this hour the promise of the Rapture we're not called to a hope we're called to a certainty in this hour and man can't bring that certainty no but God's the one who brings that certainty it's God that though your mind can Wonder here that it's God that takes the experience in your life and helps you to see your experience is found in the word of God not upon sensation not upon anything else but upon the word of God we believe in Sensations we believe in all that but our experience is rooted in the word of God that whether I feel it or not I am saying Hallelujah brother said when I was a younger Christian he said Satan used to beat me around the skunk he said until I finally recognize I can point him right back to the word that I have met God's requirements and that's where I stand you can stand right there that Vision that'll stabilize you in the midst of times and troubles you've got a strength to draw from Hallelujah let me try to bring this down here there's a lot of troubles brother random will talk about there's times he said we're in a time of trouble right now where he said you can't stop the churches from going into that Council of church you just can't do it he said no you talked to him he said they don't want nothing to do with it right it's a spirit good people are you with me brother I'm sending the message Shalom he said what it is it's gross Darkness upon him he said it's people they want to do right but there's a spirit upon them that won't let them do right yeah is that right he said women want to be women but there's a spirit upon them that won't let them be that way man and so forth another man goes on to all that it's a spirit we're dealing with right so what are you saying by the same I'm telling you psychology is not powerful enough to stand before a demon but there is one who is greater than every demon every Power could not imagine something it is Jesus the mighty conqueror oh my brother Graham said you go to the doctor and he'll say well I'm sorry to tell you you have cancer well quickly that's all he's dead that's just all there is to it or they'll be gone the doctor says well that's parallelism that's leukemia they're as good as dead right then fear sets in see but it shouldn't who is this now watch how let's address this fear one child brother random said fear sets in but it shouldn't now what's he going to do he's going to direct our minds our hearts to who is present to dismiss fear because if all you look at is a doctor's report if all you feed on is newscast right all you feed on this step of the world then I'm going to tell you it's gonna be fear banging you up but notice he said it shouldn't now I love this because you see this is the characteristic of God when there's things that God deals with my heart on here's what I look for it's because God just does not come around and say you're wrong but God always points us and lets us know there's a way out I'm just telling you when God deals with my heart in a message I look for that because that's his characteristic because he is the Waymaker he just don't come down and condemn us and say that's it he's a way Baker and real genuine correction will always point us back to the cross [Applause] I'm just telling you that's that's right because you say how I'm looking at the characteristic of God and I expect that no watch how brother M turns this fear sets in see but it shouldn't now watch what he says who is this made the promise who made the problem so he's asking questions you know why if he just said it our mind would wonder but my question is who made the promise so let's just answer this who made the promise well am I by myself tonight who made the promise for healing the Lord did right okay who is this that made the promise the Lord what are we living for we're living for him why are we the Church of the Living God because he purchased we were for ordained right we were purchased for we were purchased we were bought why are we filled with the Holy Ghost oh my why are we filled with the Holy Ghost to remember in the time of trouble he is still here [Music] why in the midst of it all he's still here who made the promise not man who heals her body not man God does he's our healer he's our deliverer why are we the Church of the Living God because he hath made us why are we filled with the Holy Ghost because of his grace that we might remember in the time of travel he is still here he stabilizes things he is the same yesterday today and forever he is with us just the same he might be resting a few moments between the meetings but he's still here just the same amen wow when trouble sets in and Faith of him being with us but then fear sets in and when fear sets in then we really got trouble so when faith comes a knocking this is what the holy spirit is given for who made the promise why am I his child who is he what has he done for me who is this we're not talking about a Doctrine now we're talking about him he's the one who stabilizes us amen David could write it like this now here's what it means to be stabilized let me just let me tie this up here it means to be made or become unlikely to give away or overturn it makes us unlikely to give way what does he does brother Adam how you hold your religion now he's holding me true the word also means to make or become unlikely to change fail or decline do you realize that the spirit of God in your life and in my life you cannot fail you cannot feel because for you to fail would mean God fails are you hearing me God cannot fail God's not a man that he should lie not the son of man that he should repent he don't got to take back any word and so what the holy spirit is it's God's word coming to unite with that desire he placed within you and that is his word made manifest I don't care what you feel like I don't care what you think about yourself the word cannot be defeated [Music] it would be easier to stop the Sun it would be easier to do anything else but this word cannot be stopped [Applause] the power of the Holy Ghost working in a redeemed child of God you can't quit because you didn't start this work you might be in a place right now you've been in for a while but that's not your destiny sin was never your destiny this first birth was not your destiny your destiny was to be a sound and daughter of God what came along your way what came my way the mercy of God and release strength to you and I that's why we can say the Lord is the strength of my life [Music] Hallelujah the Lord David would go on to say is my strength and my shield my protection you know what your Shield is he's your husband you got a problem with me talk to my husband that's what this second evil do you got a problem with me you got you're disputed out come on let's go talk to him that's what Esther says Esther said come on Haman let's go let's get in the prince of the Kings one cover you and your lives in the prince of the king matter of fact I'm not just going to give one banquet I'll call a double portion of alcohol I never banquet come on in the presence of the king you know what Esther was energized by the king's message there was an authority she had to bring her Accuser and expose him in the presence of the king [Applause] she receives strength from the King Hallelujah my heart trusteth in him and I'm helped therefore my heart greatly rejoices and my song will I Praise Him Psalms 28 8 the Lord is I love this their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointing he not only is my strength he comes to my rescue praise the Lord when I'm overwhelmed I don't know what to do he is my saving strength but I don't seem like I can break from out everything that's all around me I don't seem like I can break beyond that but he is my saving strength all I've got to do is cry out to him I may not be able to audibly use my voice I might be right there with my hands working but I can make a call right here and if I call right here he will hear my heart and he is my saving strength he will drop a word down to me his presence will come my way he not only is the strength of my life he is my saving strength can I say it like this he is my sanity thank you yeah yeah Psalms 29 11 the Lord will give strength unto his people the Lord will bless his people with peace Psalm 68 35 oh God Thou Art terrible awesome yeah out of thy holy places you know what David is saying but Lord you're not just confined to holy places but you're awesome out of there Hallelujah the god of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people blessed be God [Applause] I believe the Lord the reason him laying these things on my heart to read here even for a few weeks he's a laid right here I believe him having this lay here for weeks and then even to appoint it right now even in this time and to anoint these things for you and I I believe God's trying to help us and let us see not only is he to be the strength of our life but he's also our backup when we need strength he's right there he don't say no you've used enough strength no no no we're gonna we're gonna cut you off you've no she's only so much on the power grid you can't have no more you got to cut down your air conditioner you got to cut all this down quit quit asking me to come so much you need to conserve the energy not at all God is not a conservationist on the power of God he does not believe in regulating it conserving it tightening it or finding it oh I wish I could preach now he has loosened the Holy Ghost in This Hour he is our shrimp there is no regulator on it when you've got a need in your body call out to him there's no limiter on the power of God but they're saying that he's already answered five prayers today why not make it six we're no limiters on God praise our strength is in him finish this one with me I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me where do we receive our strength from from him who made the promise Abraham how are you getting by getting about pretty good well look at you look at your body you're more frail now than when I saw you years ago all right but you don't know who I am nursing on what you don't know I'm nursing on the breasted one I'm nursing strength from El shadiah amen not only the one who's able to forgive my iniquities but the one who also heals my body amen he's got the double cure he's got the double portion I'm drawing strength from him and you know what if I can just get up next to him get in his presence and I can hear his heartbeat it satisfies me just his presence was satisfied just his presence will satisfy will his presence does it take away all your troubles Abraham no he don't take it away but it just well let me just put it this way he's the one who steals sweetens bitter Waters about what drawing from El shadia oh friends don't you see what the Holy Spirit has done it raises this from just being a good devotional book it raises this from just being a memorization of chapters and scriptures and oh I know that chapter oh I know that story it raises it to prophecy what does that the spirit of God it makes it more than just the book we look at but it is our life the author himself has given us life and our life is lived by the word our life is energized and inspired by the word of God Amen because we're just passing through yeah this Valley of baka weeping it's not my destination I'm just passing so you can talk to you you can tell that trial right now I'm just passing that depression just passing through it I'm not your permanent resident anxiety I'm not your permanent resident I'm just passing through sickness I'm not your permanent resident I'm just passing through you just happen to be a part on the journey that God has permitted to come this way but you're not my destiny I know where I come from and I know where I'm going that's right do you love him tonight yeah Lord Jesus how we thank you tonight thank you Lord for your mercy once again thank you Lord God for Lord how did you come and you strengthen us you truly Lord are not just the strength and that is a wonderful reality Lord that you are the strength of Our Lives Lord by the Holy Spirit Lord but you are also our savings strength Lord I pray tonight dear God may you move Lord as you have been Lord in this service may you move for every need Lord may you move Lord tonight Lord if there's one that God has not Lord experienced that stabilizing power Lord May tonight this be Lord and take an opportunity and take that moment Lord God to Lord look to you and invite you o God to move down in the depths of their life to stabilize them Lord to where Lord that there is a promise Lord a promise Lord that holds in their heart Lord by the earnest of the holy spirit that I know in whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed against today they've got a promise the Lord that in my father's house for many mansions they've got a promise Lord that they can look to and draw strength in times of weariness in times of dreariness in times of Gloom in times when Sorrows come in times Lord when things come their way they have a source of strength Lord has that song I Believe Lord I don't know if it might be sheltered In The Arms Of God but Lord you know Lord just here some weeks ago just singing that song I have a source of strength I have that source of strength Lord father here tonight Lord we have a source of strength may you Minister Lord I pray right now Lord for every need that's gathered the Lord right here tonight we commit it into your hands now Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah glory be to God let him be your strength say Lord You Are My Strength let him be the strength of your life Hallelujah if you've not had that in the depth of your life invited him tonight just just don't look at it as a sermon get this on the sermon it's God speaking it's God ministering personally invite him in Vite him into your life if there's something that stays or hinders in the way put it aside confess it get it out of the way God is not one to stand there and hold things against you and keep bringing you back to it once repentance has been made it's gone amen I said it's gone you can walk free and clear and be a partaker of the promises of God Hallelujah and he is your saving strength tonight whether it be in the body whether it be Affliction whether it be a mind battle whatever it might be he is your saving strength and make sure you look at it tonight this is not my destiny this condition that is around me is not my destiny I'm just passing through I'm a pilgrim and a stranger so what are you saying brother Samuel don't make this trial don't start setting up housekeeping in this trial because the trial is not for you to set up housekeeping the trial is to draw strength from El Shady eye that our lives might be malted Hallelujah can you sing that song I have a source of strength I don't know is it sheltered in the arms of God is that was that is that one of the verses in there I have a source is that is that the song can you sing that brother sheltered in the arms of God hallelujah could we stand and listen in the field I feel the touch yes sheltered in there you go amen [Music] I feel the touch of heaven so kind and tender [Music] ly in the past that I must try I'll have no fear Jesus walks beside me more [Music] [Music] stood safe Within us that he was not over me Royal [Music] the arms of God shall hear the call from here [Music] it's the last mile you've already [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] worry shelter safe Within Me of God [Music] he was with me [Music] thank you Lord [Music] foreign [Music] we are the arms of God [Applause] 's way time the dark clouds us they won't worry me

[Applause] [Music] [Music] My Cry If Only I will call that's it [Music] for the world [Music] after all this life is over [Music] yes [Music] blue [Music] my savior [Music] buries me faith that I can make it after [Music] Hallelujah looking Beyond the trial you don't remove it but like the song has said which completely with the scriptures drawing strength from him I know where I'm going and I just feel in my heart if you don't have that settled tonight let's get that settled because you're never going to be able to draw strength from El Shady eye you don't come the right way the Bible said blessed is the man whom thou calls it to approach unto that course it wasn't us it's not you it's God's drawing brother Brown said it like this he said God was telling Abraham Abraham as El Shadi I am dwelling behind the blood if you will come you can partake of my strength and draw strength from me I'll tell you tonight there's nothing nothing stand in the way unless you allow it to stand there's nothing that can hinder you from being a partaker of it unless you allow it but I would say tonight why here in his presence that here tonight it's a time to wear it so you've got a place to look not just at the trial not just the tests and not just the things that's going on around you because this world there's there's heartaches and things all around but there's a place where you can draw strength that's from El shadyheim yeah that's from almighty God one that'll stabilize you in the midst of your journey and tonight even if you've got to wear the circumstances all around you you feel like when you can look back and say my Lord that's all I'm talking about I'm talking about nothing but a bunch of circumstances that I'm seeing no strength there but tonight if you can just say Lord all right I'll lift my eyes unto the hills from what's cometh my health my health coming from the Lord he's the one that stabilize us he's the one to give us strength in the midst of what has taken place around us because if all we look at is what's around us and talk about it our confession becomes so negative right and God don't dwell in nothing negative God don't dwell in negative well someday I'll be a good Christian he ain't the high priest of that because that's not what he did to work for he didn't work the dead to do it so that someday you'd be a good one he already did the work and he can only intercede on what he has already done that you confess he is to you he is my deliverer he is my savior he is my healer he is my redeemer then he can go to work upon that confession it stabilizes us it gives us a sight above this right here of what is here and he's the one that as I pass through this it gives me strength because I know I'm going somewhere see what it comes down to do you have that assurance that I know that I know that I know in whom I have believed oh brother Samuel I I believe on the Lord Jesus but do you know him do you know him more than just his word come on do you know him in a personal relationship where he is the rock of your life do you know him in that way that you can say if this very moment I know where I'm going I know in whom I have believed and I have this peace like a river that it Is Well with My Soul then in the midst of that like the man standing on the bow of the ship who wrote that song by divine inspiration he had a daughter that he went on to Glory right and here he was and they announced to him and said in so many moments this ship is going to be sinking here's the possibility he began to worship they said what are you doing why are you singing like that he said because I've got a Godly Glory and I've got one in New York one way or another I'm gonna see one maybe the next few minutes it might be the one in glory or the next few minutes it might be the one in New York but either way I've got an appointment I've got a destiny [Music] what was he drawing strength from from what the sacrifice had made available to him oh friends this is not our destiny thank you Jesus Jesus this is not our destiny this realm that you and I look at this realm there's a realm that's more real than this realm there's a realm that's greater than this realm that we see and we experience the pressures and the twills of life but there's a realm that's greater there's a realm where we receive strength from down into this realm like brother random called it in that quote I read to how to look into the Unseen he said there's a something that gives us strength I like how he said it that way there's a something you know what that means it's something that's unexplainable you can't explain how the strength of the Lord comes you can't explain it it's happened to me many times I yet I can't explain it there's been
