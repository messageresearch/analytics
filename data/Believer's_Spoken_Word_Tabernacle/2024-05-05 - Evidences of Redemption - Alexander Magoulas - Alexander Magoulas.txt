my name in his will and he said that I I could still go free now I never really could quite understand why a king would want to leave his throne oh my think about it now to Dawn the Robes of an Earthly man and feel the pain of fles Flesh and Bone then lat Tred that old longly path oh that led to Cal where those blood red stains they broke all up my shame just so that you and I we could still

you'd have a problem this morning but he said you could go free amen I don't know what you're going through today but I believe as the word Goes Forth today God's going to set some people free I believe that cuz God's done that for me I was that guy that was So Unworthy to live wasn't even fit to kill but you know what God had plans for me and God's got plans for you today there plans for peace amen for an expected end you believe that amen let's just look to him I invite you to pray with me just this time now as we bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord what an Emancipation Proclamation has been declared oh the world looks at this Bible they look at this message they see rules and letters of Law and they see bondage but Lord we're the freest people on the of the Earth today Lord they can lock us in a prison like Paul and Silas and we're still the freest people that's ever been I pray today Lord for everyone that's here for every situation they lay aside every weight every Fetter would be broken Lord Every Chain every Power of bondage is defeated already today in the name of Jesus Lord we just ask now you'd come bless this service bless the reading of the word and the utterance thereof Lord help me as a man to just get out of the way Lord these people don't need me today they need you Lord we need you to come on the scene Lord we need you to show up Lord and we know you will you keep all of your appointments we've we've we have invited you but Lord we want you to be welcome Lord to walk through the aisles to walk through the corridors of our heart and have your way in this place today and do that which only you can do exceeding abundantly above the anything that we could think or ask today Lord we commit this time into your hands it's for your praise and your glory and honor we ask it all in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you well I feel pretty free today amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles this morning we're going to look into a couple places here we're going to look into Jeremiah the 32nd chapter and then we'll also be looking in 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter and uh just want to greet you once again in the name of the Lord amen God is good to us and uh what more can we say to these things God be for us who can be against us yes sir Jeremiah the 32nd chapter and uh for context the Prophet Jeremiah and these people Israel they're getting ready to go into the Captivity they're going to be in captivity for 70 years here in Babylon and the word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah here in the sixth verse it says and Jeremiah said the word of the Lord came unto me saying behold Hanam the son of shalum thine Uncle shall come unto thee saying bu thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it so Hanam my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord and said unto me by my field I pray thee that is in anoth which is in the country of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the Redemption is thine by for thyself then I knew that this was the word of the Lord and I bought the field of Hanan uncle's son that was an anoth and weighed him the money even 17 shekels of silver and I subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took Witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances notice here so I took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open I gave the evidence of the purchase unto baroo the son of narah the son of mas in the sight of hanil my uncle's son in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison and I charged baroo before them saying thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both that which is sealed and this evidence which is open this is curious and put them in an earth and vessel that they may continue many days for thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel houses and Fields and Vineyards shall be possessed again in this land 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter let's read verses 5 to8 the Apostle Paul here speaking by the spirit of God and he says this for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord a lot of preachers would do really well if they did that amen Lord help us not to preach ourselves this morning but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus s notice for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure this light of this knowledge we have this treasure in Earth and vessels and now notice the reason why that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not us may the Lord bless the ring his word you may be seated today I'd like to speak on a thought today you know I'm I'm not I asked my kids I had a title for this I thought it was really cool and it sounds like I'm a boomer or something so now now I got cold feet I'm not going to do it um I'm G preach on uh just evidences of redemption evidences of redemption I like this in Jeremiah 32 because there's there's two evidences of course we know according to the scripture that that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every testimonies to be established amen and so we talk about the evidence of redemption and actually just had a brother talk to me about it yesterday a little bit you know uh people throughout the church changes they've looked for evidence of redemption amen the Methodist used to say when you shouted you had it amen and the Pentecost used to say well if you spoke in tongues you had it or if you did this you put your name on a book you shake hands with the preacher they're looking for an Evidence of Redemption amen but but God is The Interpreter of his own word amen God is The Interpreter of his own word and uh we recognize and this is the point I was trying to get at if you could look at a natural physical evidence say well this person did that so they're saved and this person does that so they're saved your confidence would be in the physical manifestation of it and not the one that made the promise amen if you could look at speaking in Tong and say well I spoke in Tong now nothing against speaking in tongues amen we believe that right I get a couple more amens that amen that's not Pentecost it's just the word amen we believe in that amen but if you take that and you make that the evidence say well listen I spoke in tongues I've got the Holy Ghost your confidence is in the fact you spoke in tongues not in the one who gives it amen because John said I've baptized you listen lots of people got baptized by John said I indeed baptized you with water but the one that comes after me he's mightier than I he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire so I can't baptize you with the Holy Ghost no man can do Christ gives the Holy Ghost he's the one that made the promise and he's the one that fulfills it he's The Interpreter of his own word amen now let me just say this we know according to the message only the predestinated are considered in Redemption so we're talking about Redemption today we're talking about the predestinated we're talking about the Sons and Daughters of God that were forn of God before the foundation of the world Amen so God this this is what I'm getting at God did not predestinate a church like a Methodist Church or a Baptist Church or a Catholic Church he didn't even PR predestinate a bride like a church he predestines individuals they have his attributes and those attributes gathered together they make up the body of Christ so it's not it's not a carnal Association it's not about where we go it's about our position in Christ amen amen so this idea of redemption it's it's a great subject to undertake it's probably one of the penultimate things we could talk about amen and we talk we think about this when brother R preaches the opening of the seals in 1963 what is being open to the people the book of redemption the book of redemption is the thing that Adam lost the book of redemption is the thing that according to a prophet according to Malachi 4 has been restored a mighty angel came down Hallelujah somebody a mighty angel came down with an open book and he gave this book to John he gave the book To Us amen everything that Adam lost it has been restored today to the Bride of Jesus Christ they as individuals there's one here there's one there they come together they've got their liif fire today they're the redeemed they're the possessors they're the ones with the book amen so we look at this brother B when he's preaching the seals and he's preaching the breach between the seven Church chases and the Seven Seals he actually references this book of Jeremiah the 32nd chapter so uh and he makes the point list in the book that Jeremiah had it's not a four cornered book like we use nowadays where it's got It's a scroll it's rolled up amen so as you unfurl this scroll as you unravel these seals consecutively one after another they're breaking it's it's it's all one piece of paper can I say it that way it's it's not a bunch of different pieces it's it's one word it's one scroll it's one Lord One Faith it's one baptism Amen brother B said the scroll is here we know it was there we know that it was Redemption we believed it was Redemption jeremi said this scroll must be kept he says as you read it there he'll say it must be kept in an Earthly vessel he says oh my what a beautiful thing I could talk about a while well I'm fixing too since he didn't talk about that much there but there you go he says the scroll was kept in an Earthly vessel a vessel that once became flesh he says Glory he got a little excited about that one amen a vessel that once became flesh died and rose again and kept in an Earthly vessel until the time of purchase brother B says in the first seal that's the way the whole Bible was wrote in Scrolls he says and so to break these seals it opens the mystery of the book and then he says did you get to study Jeremiah man that's a good teacher did you look that up yet this is a whole another side story but uh to make my point you know I worked with a woman years ago and she was raised Catholic she wasn't even a practicing Catholic and and she uh she come up to me one day she's like well you just think you're better than everybody else I'm like well no not really don't know what I did to offend her but you just think because you read the Bible and you do all this stuff it makes you special no I'm God made me special that's why I do all that stuff I didn't quite say it that way but well she's like I want you to know I believe just the same way as you do you know and so I said well um I I reference the scripture in the book of Acts where the Bible said they're the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch and make I was making the point that Christians they're disciples they're discipline they apply themselves to it I said I want you to go look this scripture up when you get home and then tell me what you think about it and I would come back for weeks every week i' be like hey did you look that up yet no I didn't look it up yet do you look it up yet no I didn't look it up I finally let it go she one day like listen it's still it's sitting right there on my table I'm like and that's all the further it's going to go wow amen so I like this brother's like I want you to catch in other words did you get to look up Jeremiah so if you get a chance go home look it up but he said did you get to study Jeremiah how he wrote that many of you taken it down last night how them seals were wrote and placed away for keeping until he returned after 70 years of the Captivity so I like this it's one scroll it's one piece that's why brother B says that any true Revelation that comes from God it'll run from Genesis to revelation God has a continuity he doesn't need an Editor to make sure that the lore and his story lines up he is the word and his continuity is perfect no scripture can be broken there's no variance there's no disagreement people think there are but there's not this word is perfect in itself it doesn't need an interpreter it doesn't need a an addendum it doesn't need rewrote or updated it's perfect amen so we're talking about this evidences of redemption it's plural it's two amen and so it's like I said you know in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word's established and I want you to think about your confession this morning amen cuz you want to look at at at at evidences of of the life that you have what what did you used to be and what are you now what made the change amen because when God comes to live inside a man or woman it changes the way they speak amen their circumstances are no longer just circumstances they're they're they they're opportunities for the glory of God Amen you look at trials different you look at situations different you look at outcomes different and you recognize that God is working in your life amen so we would to have the right kind of a confession the Bible says if you believe in the heart and you confess with the mouth you'll be saved amen Paul said that that and he's quoting David David said I've believed therefore I have spoken and Paul says we believe therefore we also speak amen so I want you to think this morning about what you speak over your lives there's power in your words death and life are in the power of your tongue today amen if you're a redeemed individual idual it does you no good unless you speak like a redeemed individual amen you've got to speak life over your home Speak Life over your situation amen we're so used to speaking negativity because it's all around us it's what the media puts out because it sells papers it sells subscriptions it sells podcast everything's negative but we've got the positive we've got something that's greater than the economy we've got something that's greater than the government we've got something that's greater than Co today amen Hallelujah Galatians 4:6 the Bible says this because you are Sons I love that he didn't say if you do this you'll be Sons but because you're already Sons because God fornew you because you were part of God's thing because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father that's what is he doing he's saying what you're saying he's he's ling a witness to your confession amen the book of Romans 8 says the spirit itself it Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children we are the sons of God listen anybody can walk into a church and call themselves The Son of God right but when God says you're a Son of God that's what makes the difference listen the Jews they accuse Jesus of blasphemy well you're making yourself God he said my witness isn't of myself my father Bears witness The Works bear Witness I don't have to stick up for just me today and hope you believe it God has given us a witness that's what the message is about that shows sunship it shows your predestination amen I love it because brother talks about that China man you know that story talks about the China man with the laundry he said he's got a better system than we do today and it's still better than what we got even now today amen because you can make up numbers you can fabricate sheets but that China man he couldn't read numbers or read English or anything you'd go take your garment to the to the dry cleaner and say I want this China man I want him to clean my laundry and he take a piece of paper and he tear it a certain way and give you half of it now you've got a piece and I've got a piece and if you want your suit back you want your favorite dress back amen it doesn't matter how much money you put down it doesn't matter what date you come in or what numbers you write on it does the piece that you got that's the pieace that he's got cuz everyone is T different everyone's and only one piece in the world will fit that piece there's only one because it come from the same piece it come from the same fabric there's only one that's going to match and we've had churches churches we've had Brides brides but there's only one that will line up with every word that will punctuate every word of God with an amen that so she's made of a different kind of material that's bride material there oh my my Hallelujah brother br's in uh believe it was Clifton's Cafeteria one day and he's preaching he gets done and the uh I think it was Danny Henry comes that could have been the 23rd Book of Revelation he said well I appreciate that but God can't add to his word can't take away from it and he gets to there and I believe he hugs brother BR he begins to speak in tongues and there's three different interpreters there there's one from the UN there's another they all speak French and so they begin to take the interpretation one writes it down one speaks it they've all got the brother B said they all had the exact same interpretation even to the punctuation why cuz they heard the same thing three different people had the same thing they said cuz they heard the same original amen so even though there was three different people they all had one interpretation it was the correct interpretation cuz they knew French now I don't know French but I know the Lord amen sometimes I pretend I know French but I don't know French amen they all have it's they don't have three different interpretations they actually have the same interpretation it's just in the mouth of two or three Witnesses Amen brother B says this in the Paradox message we'll cross Jordan the separation now he's talking about this in 1961 he said God break to us the seals on the back of the book let let us enter into this great place now for Joshua divided to the people their inheritance that God had left for them so what is the evidence speaking of the same thing it's spoke of for Jeremiah it's your inheritance it speaks about what family you're from it speaks about what belongs to you it speaks about your privileges and your rights to that property amen so the opening of the seals is not just identifying what is yours but who you are amen the scripture says in Romans the 5th chapter for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life in other words if God already done saved you how much more can he do for you today amen how much more is he going to redeem you today amen he did not save you to lose you he did not find you to forget you amen but if he's interested in you if he's got evidence of you that you belong it shows his interest in Redemption he could have left it in the piggy bank he could have left it in the Security Vault amen but he's presented evidence through the message of this day and say I'm interested in redeeming this bride unto myself this is the time this is the hour this is the season Jeremiah knew when 70 years had ended when the Captivity was over when it was time to go to the Homeland there would be somebody to pick that scroll up to dig up that Earth and vessel and say this belongs to me it's it's mine it was paid for and I've got my receipt something I learned to do a long time ago I keep all my receipts both figuratively and literally I keep them all I stick them in a paper bag so if I ever get audit I just throw the whole paper bag you can sort them out I learned to do this years ago I I read a I I mentioned a quote one time in a service and this this is years ago I was just starting out and a guy come up said hey where'd you get that from and I'm like I don't remember you ever been there before that was a little dicey so I went and I looked it up I found it like five different places in the message I printed it all out I brought it back to church the next night he didn't even show up I see how you are so I keep my receipts know when I say the only the predestinate considering Redemption you say where's that at I can show you where it's at right I mean you ought to be of course it's easier when you got a search engine Heen it's not just one listen it's one thing to know what the Bible or the message says it's another thing when you get into it yourself and you say listen I can take you to the very spot where I purchase this redemp where God purchased this Redemption for me I can take you to the very spot where God gave me the victory I can take you to the very spot amen I can show you the receipt I can show you the paperwork I can show you what I was and I'm not what it is today I didn't make the change you didn't make the change God made the change You' got some receipts listen I know what was paid for cuz I couldn't afford it they're saying then how' you get it if you could afford it somebody give me the receipt somebody left the receipt with me and I've looked through here and I know it's been purchased I know it's been paid for you've got to get into it and look for yourself amen we've been reconciled we're saved by his life that's why brother said you weren't saved on any particular day you didn't get saved 5 years ago or 10 years ago or 20 years ago or even 40 years ago you got saved 2,000 years ago when Jesus dieded on the cross for you and rose again you just found out one day you looked at the receipt said oh that belongs to me it's got my name on it it's for me oh Hallelujah it was already paid for listen purchasing power is not the issue today right listen purchasing power listen it's already paid for if he had to he would bankrupt heaven to keep his promises the solvy of God's ability to purchase your Redemption is no longer in question today but do you recognize what he's given us do you recognize what he's given you many times we recognize when he gave somebody else yeah he healed so and so and yeah he gave so and so joy and yeah he helped so and so but he's done it for each of us today you've got to see you're on the receipt you've got to realize that your ticket matches that ticket that come down from glory amen [Music] prise the Lord we've got an original amen we don't just have a Reformation we have restoration it's been put back you hear me son put back to the way it was in the beginning brother talks about this in the rising of the sun he says you can get a title yeah you can get a title to a place think about I tell you what don't get me started on property rights I don't want to get political again I always get here you can buy a place oh here I am you can buy a place and you can own it for 30 years and you can pay taxes on it and guess what happens when you don't pay taxes one time they start coming after you I thought I owned it how could you take well praise the Lord somebody you can get a title to a place listen there's a bowling alley there in in vanward Ohio where I live and it's got It's got a it's got a thing on the title if somebody buys this property they can't make it another bowling alley you know who bought it the other bowling alley in town cuz they didn't want any competition so they put a little claws in there listen if you buy this other alley you can't be our competitor nobody wants to buy it now the property's fine the machine's fine but nobody wants it because there's a little sentence on there that little thing is held against whoever would buy that nobody wants it for a bowling alley nobody wants it for anything it's been sitting there and sitting there I think finally somebody bought it and made a restaurant or something I it I don't know but is that right right my wife I'm glad I brought see my receipt she's usually the receipt but nobody would buy it for years because of that amen one little thing see you can buy the title and that's fine he says you can get a title place but that don't say it's yours no sir somebody way back Yonder could come in and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract when you get the original it shows that everything that's ever against it is struck off PL back from the foundation is that right he says when a man has said that he believes the word then when the Holy Spirit comes it's the abstract to the title it gives you permission somebody say I got permission it gives you permission you don't have to ask anybody you've got permission it gives you permission when you have the abstract every bit of that belongs to you everything that's on it belongs to you he says that gives us the abstract with the Holy Ghost comes upon this title deed that God saw but back Yonder before the foundation of the world put it in a book of life it was but it was born through a man or a woman it was subject to sin guilty of sin when I believed on it I received the deed but when the Holy Ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it it's gone amen we've got a token to it's an abstract I want you to recognize in Luther's day Luther had the word for his day he had Reformation but he didn't have the original word can I say it this way there was a lean there's some things against Luther you could look at Luther and say but I yet I have something against you it's not the full word amen it wasn't ready for Redemption it wasn't ready for a Rapture there was little things left off there things about sanctification things about Mysteries that were left off Wesley comes along he preaches sanctification and sanctification is good we believe in sanctification we believe in living holy amen but yet there was things there that were left off it wasn't ready yet but when this message come not just a Reformation the original abstract word what did Malachi do He restored that means it's restored completely amen it restored the word amen not just a faith the faith the abstract the word that was once delivered to the Saints it's in possession today amen there's nothing there amen there's nothing in your life now it depends on what kind of an order do you ask see this is why your confession is important well I've made this mistake and I failed here and I listen if you let Satan order your property he'll find all kinds of things well listen you're not good enough you're not smart enough you can't go in the Rapture you come from this family you've got this situation but when you look at the abstract none of that's there amen cuz the abstract was wrot before any of that was ever done God never put that in the original God never put that in the abstract amen so your confession is going to determine where you live you can live on borrowed property or you can live free it's all going to depend on what you speak over your situation it's all going to depend on what your confession is amen you can take the words of a Shyer and a squatter or you can say I've got the abstract and his spirit hallelujah it's Bor witness with my spirit that I am an overcomer that I am more than a conqueror that I can do all things through Christ who loves me through Christ who strengthens me it's not you today it's him today we preaching Christ it's Christ in you he's the hope of glory you didn't start this and you're not going to end it but he's going to settle it for some of us he's going to settle it right here today things you've dealt with things you've lived with for years he's ready to set her up amise the Lord hallelujah in this age Christ has struck off every claim can I say this say it this way every excuse of the enemy for why you can't overcome listen they can't be a Son of God because of this they can't every excuse that he's fabricated or invented it's nullified in this hour there's nothing left amen that's why this bride she is predestinated not to fall because the one that had the original abstract has presented it to the Bride of Jesus Christ through the prophet of Malachi 4 and we are looking at it it's no longer glass Darkly it's no longer a closed book we're looking at it face to face we're seeing what it says and we recognize there's not one spot amen there's not one blemish because he's the one that said I will have a church with no spot no blemish or any such [Applause] thing so to have this Redemption to have this purchasing there must be an unsealing of an evidence that was formerly sealed amen that is so good John says this in first John he says if we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater if you take nothing else home today I hope you remember no matter what witness you've heard the witness of God is greater there's no one to overrule the witness of God when you have the abstract there's no other document well I've got this document you know how lawyers are they come up and they've got 400 pages and they throw it up there like you got to read through this and you got to this and get a lawyer listen I got the abstract I don't care what this says it's in my hand it doesn't matter what mommy and daddy say it doesn't matter what the church says what God has said amen if we receive the W it doesn't matter what you think about it listen you're your own biggest enemy that's right and many times you're the one holding you back God is not here today to hold us back God is not here today to put us in bondage the thief comes to steal and to kill and destroy said I've come right amen that you might have life it abundantly amen the witness of God is greater for this is the witness of God which is testified of his son he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness can I say this way has the evidence in himself he has the witness in himself he that believes not God hath made him a liar because he believed not the record that God gave of his son and this is the record that God has given us eternal life and this life is in his son amen now if you just leave that all back there say well that was good back there that's listen the enemy can do that well yeah we used to have an abstract in the church we used to have an absolute but listen we're in a modern era we've got new things we've got new challenges and new situations and it's the same devil and it's the same God and the same devil that was defeated back there he's defeated today and the same God that was Victorious back there he's Victorious today listen he didn't just defeat the Devil he spoiled him he made us show them openly he gloated over him he showboated over him he marched him through the streets naked showing the devil has no power over the believer other than what you give him right that's good other than what you give him you can speak his language and you can live in that place or you can speak what the word says and you can live far above every principality every Power but I'm going through things I'm dealing with things that's not the point the point is the abstract says it's defeated if it takes 5 minutes or 500 years he's still defeated [Applause] today see the nominal Church they believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again amen but that's not the same as having the abstract in you amen a historical document is not what the Bible is talking about we have a living w we Are Witnesses with it amen the Bible says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come right not just did come is come in the flesh is of God Amen every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist amen so if the enemy has you believe that this The Life of Christ the record of eternal life life which is the evidence of your Redemption if he just puts that in an earn vessel back there somewhere and you leave it in the ground you can't purchase Redemption with that amen you don't actually have a claim till you go get it and get it up to date amen till you have it in your possession so a lot of people that it's like we just celebrated Easter a lot of people believe you can go to the tomb where Jesus is that well listen he's not using it today right it's no longer in use it's vacant right I don't suggest you pick it up amen he's not there amen it's not there today praise the Lord but the treasure is in Earth and vessels today the same treasure that was in an earth and vessel back there it died and rose again it proved it was Messiah it proved it was the Savior it proved it was the Christ and it ascended into Heavenly places but the life that was in that Earth and vessel came back on the day of Pentecost as cling tongues of fire and it sat over the people and it testified that even the even the enemies of God could look at these disciples and they could perceive they've been with Jesus there's something different about them it's little Messiah at running around the world today having the same life the same power the same Authority preaching the same word now we have this treasure Paul speaking afterwards there in the book of second Corinthians we have this treasure and Earth in right vessels brother B says when Jeremiah wrote this book it was sealed he say here's a good thing I want you to notice all you that read it then that sealed book he say now remember it was going to be gone he had prophesied now he didn't know only through prophecy he says are you following me through prophecy he knew through the revelation of God that they was going to be away from that country for 70 years you remember him prophesying that he would be 70 years they'd be in captivity so he wanted to be sure I like that I want to make sure I ain't got no trouble when I get back I don't want no trouble at the river I don't want no trouble for my kids amen he wanted to be sure that this seal that his inheritance would be kept because he inherited his cousin's inheritance so he had it all wrote up legally and what did he do with it so it wouldn't rot or rust he put it in an Earthly vessel right and put it away so it won't rot or rust until them 70 years was expired he says glory to God I hope you would catch it did you see what God did he never revealed it to the high's and prudent so they could fuss about it all the time he put it in an Earthly vessel created himself his own son Christ Jesus you say well that's good and he says and in this last day now amen I want you to bring this up to speed here you are in this last day now he's opening the seals and showing it to his church kept it in an Earthly vessel so it w r or r he says hallelujah I know you think I'm a Holy Roller maybe I am you see but there it is it's been kept wrapped up in the vessel of the earth that was redeemed out of the Earth come up on Easter morning where death's seals couldn't hold him any longer but he broke the seals and arose up and proved himself in this last days he is alive he is in his church he is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah pise the Lord now this is the part where I you know I study this and I think about it you know I'm not maybe the smartest person in the world but you know if you uh if you give me an abstract title said you'll inherit the whole earth I would probably put it somewhere else amen you said this entitles you to everything I would probably get a lawyer and I'd probably hire some guards I get a big old Vault a big old Vault and I put this combination lock on this retina scanner and some robots and some guard dogs and I dig a mo around this thing I put some alligators in there and some sharks and I have some fighter jets flying overhead and they're just ready to you come within 100 fet Bo boom you know like I would really really I mean this is not you're getting your your dad's bottle cap collection and man this is like a big deal I would put it somewhere really safe you know what God said I'm going to put it in a pot I'm going to STI in a clay pot like you get at the Pottery Barn and I'm just like hold up here you know I don't I I would never question the wisdom of God but you know I put in a fortress or a bank or a strong box but God said I'll hide it in you right and you're sitting here today and God says yeah I'm going to stick in you it's safe there how is it safe there man I'm not even safe for me I stum my toe I tell you what praise Lord I don't know why I'm doing this but here we are you know I had I had two STS put in here a few years ago and so I I'm on these blood thinners and you know I decided one day to play with a knife with a 6in blade I'm just sitting there my parents and I drop it on my leg and I thought well that's curious that's very interesting it began to bleed I thought well I'll put a Band-Aid on it well you know what it continued to bleed six it didn't go in six Ines but I mean you know so I continued to bleed and 3:00 in the morning I finally decided hey maybe I should go to the hospital and they had to glue it up and everything else doesn't seem very safe when this guy's handling it the vessel doesn't seem like it's a very good place to put the treasures of everything doesn't seem like a great idea does it but God said no that's where I want it it's very safe there and I got to be thinking about you know I've I've I've gone different places in the world and you know you're walking along the streets you can go to you can go to Africa you can go to India you can go to downtown Sheffield amen you can go to Chicago or whatever and you can walk down the street you can walk down the dirt and listen the dirt on the north side of town it's the same dirt on the south side of town but some of it's not as safe as the others it has nothing to do with the Earth itself it's the situation around it amen I you know it's like a back here a few years here we are you know back here a few years ago they they Declassified all this stuff about Area 51 I don't know how many conspiracy theorists we got here but you know some people think there's like aliens and extraterrestrial they they Declassified all this stuff about Area 51 and some of these keyboard Warriors they got this idea said we're going to go there we're going to walk in we're going to see what's there good luck and so they're all like they got this big petition they get on the whatever they got on and they're all like listen we're all going to show up on a certain day I guess it was too early in the morning for most of them but we're going to show up on a certain day and we're going to get together and there's going to be 50,000 of us and they can't stop us all I'm thinking listen I don't know what you think you're going to do with your keyboard and your soy latte and your man bun but you ain't making it in I don't care if there's 100,000 of you they've got guns that fire tens of thousands of rounds a minute they'll shoot you from a mile away you lived in your parents basement till you were 45 you ain't breaking it anywhere now listen this base it's in the middle Nevada no one wants to live this it's the desert it's like the Deep desert there's nothing there nobody wants to live there and you can walk in the Nevada desert and go knock yourself out and listen it's just dirt it's it's not even desirable dirt nobody wants to be there but as soon as you go to that fence you're a dead man the dirt on that side of the fence is the same dirt as that side the fence the difference is who ownes it this dirt this Earth it's just like every Your Vessel it's just like everybody else's your flesh is not special your upbringing is not special your Earthly vessel is not special you're know better than anybody else the difference is you cross this line you cross this bloodline somebody's protecting that property there's something different about you than the president of the United States there's something different about you than the prime minister of Russia amen Your Vessel is owned by God almighty and you might not have a bunch of fire jets and you might not have a million man army but you've got the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivers them one angel of God can wipe out an army listen Your Vessel is feeble Your Vessel is inadequate but the one that owns it says not one step further listen Satan had ackn knowledge when he went to temp job I can't even touch him you won't let me and God said you know what I'll give you permission don't going to touch his flesh I'll give you permission but you can't take his life how that must have burned the devil just let me kill my at no you can only go as far as I say and no further and no matter where you're at today or what you're going through your vessel is God's personal property he owns it he protects it he Hedges it he's built on promises he's secured it by his angels he's filled it with his spirit and Satan can't do one thing to you before the enemy can even come against you he has to go and get permission from God and God has already spoken you shall not die you shall live to declare the works of the Lord you are not the tail you are the head [Applause] praise the Lord your dirt's special cuz who owns it not because you made it special Amen brother B talks about it we we we see it in the message in in the scripture you know people they could go into slavery they could sell themselves in the Old Testament under a bondage under slavery they had no rights but every Jubilee when that trumpet sounded the amount of debt you were in didn't matter if you'd been in a slave for 49 years or 49 seconds it didn't matter when that trumpet sounds you're free to go back to your listen he's not just sitting you free and you wall around what am I going to do you're free to go back to your inheritance you could not lose your inheritance as a Hebrew it was always secure that's why Jeremiah's cousin he couldn't he couldn't sell up to the trumps or the bidens or whatever it had to stay in the family and the promises of God are made to stay in the family amen God has spoken things for his family we're his inheritance amen we're his offspring amen praise the Lord now you can stay bound if you like the slave life but as for me it's like I was talking about Patrick Henry Give me liberty or give me death I'd rather die a Freeman than live a slave right I don't know if that's the American imy or what amen listen we were born to be free we were born to be that way and we've heard the Jubilee at the end of seven Church ages at the end of seven messages we've heard a trumpet sound amen it's declared war it's a scriptural sound it's declared war on the enemy but it's also declared Liberty to the captives it's declared the the acceptable year of Lord It's declare the day of Vengeance this is the end of all things this is the time for it amen we've heard our Jubilee and we can go free amen hallelujah this message has your Liberty in it amen amen because it's the interpretation of this word listen I don't I'm not against reading other things or this that but listen what you need for your Earthly Journey where's it it's in you how do you get there you heard the word you believe the word you've got what you need you don't have to go look for something else amen when when Ruth takes Naomi back to her inheritance back to the land she came from she didn't have to go from field to field well I'm looking for an answer here I'm looking for a solution there she found a de kidsman she went to the field she stayed in the field and she was blessed by that near Kinsman in that field and if you'll stay with the word if you'll stay with the message if you'll say what it says if you'll preach what it says God will bless you like he blessed Ruth you don't have to work it up you don't have to look for it you can rest amen cuz your Redeemer he's working when you don't see it even when you don't feel it he's working amen you can sit there and kick up your feet and you can rest cuz you know he's not going to rest NE said he will not rest until he's done the [Music] [Applause] thing praise the Lord I believe that's what the message is about we can rest we have a Shalom Amen brother say it's not Shalom for the world it's shalom for us amen you know I I told testimony years ago I don't know if I've told it here but I I told this this is years ago my first mission trip I ever went to I was in Uganda and we had meetings and we'd seen the Lord move and do certain things and there was a there was a gentleman there he'd been a Pentecostal Bishop had a church of 900 people and he heard the message and he believed the message and he left that church he left a lot of money left a nice Church Church lost 2/3 of his church he went from 900 to 300 which is still a lot but I mean he had 900 people loses 600 people and we go and we have church from him in a brush Arbor brother talks about brush Arbor we've got like six wooden poles and a bunch of brush and that's what it was amen listen this is out in the middle of the Jungle there's there's no electricity out there they had a generator there and they had the microphone two speakers and one light bulb wow I hope you don't take this the wrong way but it was night time in Africa and people are sitting there I couldn't even see the people preaching like it was that dark amen couldn't see a thing so I'm preaching these people and there's a woman near the front she's been she's laying on so you have to know how Africa is I mean if they say they start church at 3: it means 6 o00 right like they never start anything on time at least not where I was at so um so there's like people laying down sleeping I'm thinking well they probably been there all day there's this woman she's laying there I get done preaching and she's laying there and the The Interpreter comes up says we want you to pray for the sick I said okay and uh and to make my point this this bishop he' come out of Pentecost some of his associates they come they wanted to see what was going on they actually come to make fun of him like oh yeah we heard about he lost his church and all stuff so they're sitting in the meeting they heard the message preach they just kind of they're looking at each other kind of laughing the whole time and stuff well we go to pray for this woman she's laying there and I'm like what's wrong with her and The Interpreter says she's paralyzed one side of her body I said really I said so we we prayed for her I looked at him said tell her to stand up in the name of Jesus Christ he kind of looked at me f said tell her to stand up in the name of Jesus Christ so I took one hand and he took the other and she stood up and she began to walk through the meeting and so of course all the other sick people like hey I you know the water was stirring and so like there's there's a guy come up there he's blinding one eye and I'm praying for him I hadn't even finished praying for him and God opens his eyes I can see the trees out in the jungle in the night I'm thinking I can't see the trees in the jungle at night and and God begins to do one miracle and God does another miracle and these guys all of a sudden they're interested in the service they're interested in what's going on this and they they want to taught me afterwards and said well you know what's the secret of this and this and that I said listen if you preach this message that's what I'm coming to you today if you preach this message that your brother preaches if you'll take it the way God said it and you'll preach it in the spirit that God gave it and you preach it with the power that God preached it with and then he delivered it through a prophet it will do the same thing for anyone amen it's not a respector of persons it's not a onean show if you'll take the word you'll speak the word if you believe the word you can be a hillbilly from Ohio you can be a hillbilly from Kentucky you can be anybody in the world Amen the word of God will defeat Satan any place any time under any circumstances that's not just Africa it's not just India it's shef Ohio it's the worst place in the world wherever you go God is the same I firmly believe that it's not about me I don't tell you that for me I'm talking about you I'm talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ Redemptive power is in the bride the voice of the Resurrection is in the bride you sitting there right now as a Believer you have the power already in you to speak a world into existence Hallelujah and go live on it say what's the secret got a title I've got an abst amen you've got an abstract he is the abstract he is the seals that were opened what does he opening seals revealing it reveals Christ amen it tells you what's yours and like I said more importantly it tells you who you are amen amen it'd be one thing to say that I know God but it's like Paul said rather we're known of God God Knows My Name he knows your name he's interested in Redemption amen amen amen I pray God to help some of us today to get rid of that Wishbone that we pack everywhere we're always wishing W I wish things were better in church I wish things were better in my home I wish I had more victory in my life I I wish I could overcome this stop wishing that's the problem you've got a wishbone and you're like well if it PS This Way throw out the wishbone get a backbone anden what we need today is not a new revelation what we need today is not a new message what we need to do is take the one we got and believe it and speak it and act on it instead of speaking our feelings and speaking our ideas and trying to do our own thing take it and speak it and it will produce what he said cuz he's the one that made the promise amen well I wish this and I wish that quitted already amen there's no problem with the word I think a shamgar often listen shamgar could have stood up the very first time the enemy come to his house but he didn't waited and he waited and he waited and one day he got enough backbone to do something about it and some of us all waiting on God to do something in our lives well brother I've been praying for this and I've been looking for this and I'm hoping for this get up and do something about it start speaking in your situation start speaking it over your life well I wish I was healed start speaking it by his stripes I am healed I wish I could have my strength you speak and say the joy of the Lord is my strength oh brother I'm so tired I'm so weak listen when you are weak that's when his strength is made perfect you have no excuse against you today God has given you every reason to overcome some of us are looking for Faith to move mountains and we can't even move ourselves out of the chair long enough to do something for God well I wish this would happen I you know I I'm going telling myself now as some of you may have noticed the last few years I've enlarged my borders from the first time I've come here Lord I Lord I I need to lose some weight will you help me yeah I quit eating as much that's right thank right thank you brother now maybe for you it's genetic maybe for you it's glandular for me it's just too much Taco Bell there you go let's just be real about it now amen we're here now I got nothing left to hide amen listen there are things in our life there are mountains in our life we're waiting for God to move and God says no you move it you speak to the mountain don't cry to me you speak about it get up God tell you to speak about it well Lord I'm going to pray about speak about no speak it when you told and we get told and we get told like a little kid well if I do this why don't you just do it take God in his word one time and see what happens can you do it I say he can do anything the things that are hard for you the things are impossible With God all things are possible [Music] listen I'm going to say this right now we we get all flustered well they're going to call me a Holy Roller well let them call you one right hey they call Brother listen Jesus said if they call the Master of the House isub what are they going to say about you well you know I don't want to rock the boat well somebody's going to go rock your boat anyway heyen you might as well Walk on Water I guess or something you might as well do something about it don't sit there and drown don't sit there and perish oh I wish I could over listen people going to misjudge you right and that's fine right you ever been misjudged before well you're just trying to make yourself something you're just trying to be this you're this or that you know what I found out this is for you young people but even older people especially young people we get so worried what are they going to say about me they're going to think I'm crazy you know what happens when they think you're crazy nothing unless you let it help me out somebody how many times has somebody said something about us in our lives or maybe they told somebody else and they're saying well they're this and they're that listen that doesn't change who you are unless you let [Music] it people have misjudged me and they'll misjudge me again but guess what I remain myself brother Bill people misjudged you they'll probably do it again and guess what you're still brother Bill you're still the same person didn't change who you were you know what the enemy came change who you are because he says you're not family can't change who you are cuz they say you're not let me tell you you can't change who you are cuz you say you're not God spoke it it doesn't matter what they say Amen well listen I'm just going to say this way I'm getting caral now they don't hate the good ones they hate the great ones that's true if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ if you're the greatest people on the face of the Earth somebody going to hate you you might as well get used to it but it doesn't matter what they say it matters what God said it doesn't matter what the doctor said that there's no hope for you there's no there's no outcome for your situation there's no healing for you it don't matter what he says I've got a great position yes I've got a second opinion God heals people that have no hope God Saves people that can't be saved my my my I love the story David there when he comes back to the camp there you all know this story comes back to ziklag one day and the enemies come to his Camp right and he's taking everything you ever been there before get home from work oh yeah the bank just called him $1,000 overdrawn had that happen one day you all want to know this story I know it I was 28 28 years old I got called from the bank yeah you've been overdrawn for seven days you accumulated charges for seven days nice that they waited seven days a $70 fee became a $140 fee eventually became a $700 fee wow like you need to come take care of this yeah I do well here's somebody had stolen my card number I'm like can you prove that you didn't buy it I said it's for wrinkle cream from California again I was 28 at the time I said do I look like a man if I'm 50 then look like a man us wrinkle cream 28 years old do I look like a man that uses wrinkle cream no I wish I kept it that there was a point to that I don't know what it was the point was I didn't actually owe anything for that amen right sometimes the enemy comes and you've got charges and you've got sicknesses
