[15:08] in the name of jesus christ amen
[15:12] amen and amen let's turn if you would in
[15:16] the scriptures here too
[15:18] first corinthians 13.
[15:24] just want to say it just such a such a
[15:28] good weekend presence of the lord
[15:31] amen things that what god has
[15:36] has done you know there's things that
[15:39] when you see god just doesn't work
[15:42] abruptly
[15:43] god works and he builds and he builds
[15:45] and he builds and he keeps moving and
[15:48] god just comes and he he does things
[15:50] well don't he yeah
[15:51] he just and this is the thing that we
[15:53] just we just
[15:54] so thank god for that and just how the
[15:57] lord just moved
[15:58] they meant so richly right here among us
[16:02] in these services i tell you
[16:03] that's just a little foretaste of glory
[16:07] amen just the the real just it just was
[16:10] wonderful i i just
[16:12] you know it's always one of those things
[16:14] i always i get
[16:16] you know when it comes time to go to the
[16:17] house of god i always get i always get
[16:19] excited you know
[16:20] it was one of those times even i think
[16:23] about when it comes to special meetings
[16:25] my goodness i just
[16:26] it's just the time just can't wait to
[16:29] just to be able to get together
[16:31] because if god does special things
[16:35] amen there's things that god does amen
[16:37] very very very special
[16:39] and i believe god i know he did special
[16:41] things this past weekend
[16:43] amen so we just want to invite him here
[16:45] tonight
[16:47] just let's read in the word of the lord
[16:48] here tonight just just
[16:50] invite him to come and speak to us in in
[16:53] first corinthians chapter 13 and verse 1
[16:57] paul would say though i would speak
[17:00] with the tongues of men and have angels
[17:03] i have not charity
[17:05] i am become as a sounding brass
[17:08] or a team or a tingling symbol
[17:12] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[17:14] and understand all mysteries
[17:16] and all knowledge though i have all
[17:19] faith so that i could remove mountains
[17:21] and have not
[17:22] charity i am nothing though i bestow
[17:26] all my goods to feed the poor though i
[17:29] give my body to be burned and have not
[17:31] charity
[17:32] it profiteth me nothing we understand
[17:35] when we're speaking of this charity
[17:37] we're not speaking of
[17:38] ophelia love we're not speaking of that
[17:41] of a human love
[17:43] we're speaking of the divine love of
[17:46] almighty god
[17:47] but the same love that reaches out and
[17:50] deals with our heart
[17:51] and draws us to him brings conviction in
[17:54] our life
[17:55] is now that same love that comes to
[17:58] reside
[17:58] in the heart of the believer so not only
[18:01] is that love abiding in us
[18:03] but we are abiding in him amen
[18:07] so this is this is what paul is speaking
[18:09] of in verse 4
[18:11] charity suffereth long and is kind i
[18:14] want you to notice
[18:15] paul shifts here in these next parts of
[18:18] the scripture and he begins to say
[18:20] what it is not it doesn't envy
[18:24] it doesn't bond itself it's not puffed
[18:26] up
[18:27] it does not behave itself
[18:30] unseemly seeketh not our own
[18:33] it isn't easily not it is not easily
[18:36] provoked
[18:37] and it thinketh no he so we want to just
[18:40] look at this a little bit
[18:42] more tonight this evening may i ask the
[18:44] lord to bless the word as you're being
[18:46] seated tonight
[18:47] his presence let's say just
[18:51] welcome chad brother dave's
[18:53] brother-in-law good to see you here
[18:55] tonight
[18:57] trust you all been having some good
[18:59] fishing
[19:00] sorry i can't be there um but i want to
[19:04] look here at this
[19:04] and and we look at this tonight you know
[19:07] as we go through the scripture and
[19:09] you see as it points out of what charity
[19:12] is not
[19:13] and you know we can take many different
[19:16] examples upon that
[19:18] one of the ways it's wrote even in the
[19:20] amplified bible this particular phrase
[19:22] does not behave itself
[19:24] unseemly it means it is not rude which
[19:27] is unmannerly or does not
[19:29] act on becoming so
[19:32] when we want to look at this here i want
[19:34] to
[19:35] look at it because we recognize the word
[19:37] of god
[19:39] the word of god is not a list of do's
[19:41] and don'ts
[19:42] and that's not what paul is trying to
[19:44] set forth here in any way
[19:46] paul is not trying to set forth that
[19:48] there is a prescribed
[19:50] tenets or or commandments or you have to
[19:53] do this
[19:53] or you don't have to do this but he's
[19:55] letting it be known that the nature of
[19:58] god
[19:59] has come and the divine love of god has
[20:01] come on earth to bring
[20:03] a ransom and there is a reality of how
[20:06] that the church of god is to display
[20:09] itself
[20:09] and to act and i believe this with all
[20:11] my heart that you do not need to teach
[20:14] somebody
[20:14] how to be a christian you only let them
[20:17] meet god one time and there's a heart
[20:19] that gets changed on the inside
[20:21] and now they become teachable by the
[20:24] spirit of god
[20:25] there's things that sure that god has to
[20:28] he will speak to us as things that we'll
[20:30] look in here tonight of things that god
[20:32] will remind you and i love and remind us
[20:34] and speak to us upon different things
[20:36] but i do not believe that
[20:38] there is a certain parts of you know do
[20:41] these steps and these steps here you'll
[20:42] be a christian
[20:43] i think it's very fitting as dr bosworth
[20:45] would say it like this
[20:47] in the book christ is the healer and
[20:49] your brother brother bosworth would say
[20:51] it like this and you know how brother
[20:52] branham felt about brother bosworth
[20:53] brother bosworth said he said i think
[20:55] we're too busy teaching people he said
[20:57] on how to be a christian instead of
[20:58] getting them to christ because when you
[21:00] get them to christ
[21:02] then christ himself comes on the inside
[21:04] and there's a transforming power that
[21:06] takes place
[21:07] you see if christ himself if the holy
[21:10] ghost
[21:10] he promised that he would be a teacher
[21:13] when he would come
[21:14] and this is one of the things that even
[21:15] that i look for is a life
[21:17] because it doesn't matter of all the
[21:19] manifestations of everything else that
[21:21] can take place
[21:22] but if they are teachable because if
[21:24] we're not teachable
[21:25] then the teacher isn't there but if the
[21:28] teacher's on the inside
[21:29] we can be corrected we can learn we can
[21:32] grow
[21:32] because he is a teacher he takes his
[21:35] word
[21:36] and he brings it to past within our life
[21:39] and so when we look at this i want to
[21:41] look really at the contrast of it if
[21:44] if charity itself does not behave it
[21:46] behave itself
[21:47] unseemly then i want to look at the
[21:50] contrast of that and let's look at the
[21:52] positive
[21:53] that what charity itself will do it will
[21:56] actually conduct itself
[21:58] in honor it will conduct itself in a
[22:01] manner so that there is a testimony
[22:03] that cannot be evil spoken of it will
[22:06] produce an
[22:07] honor that no matter whether the person
[22:09] is a believer
[22:10] or an unbeliever we can honor that
[22:13] person
[22:14] we can honor that not honor their sin
[22:16] because all through the scriptures
[22:17] you'll find
[22:18] that even where it says to honor all men
[22:20] it is not speaking of honoring the
[22:22] wickedness
[22:23] or the sin of the sinner but yet to
[22:26] actually
[22:27] honor the man how could we honor them by
[22:29] being
[22:30] respectful by being nice it doesn't
[22:32] matter what they look like they might
[22:34] look so scary
[22:35] they might have all sorts of things you
[22:37] know earrings and everything else but
[22:39] there's a soul
[22:40] down there on the inside so there's a
[22:43] way that you and i and it's not just
[22:45] those
[22:45] in that condition but even among us as
[22:48] believers there's a real
[22:50] reality that invites god's presence when
[22:53] we actually honor
[22:54] one another and this is where paul says
[22:56] preferring
[22:57] one another you know to think of it in
[23:00] this regards you know of how that god
[23:03] himself would would just be invited to
[23:05] this in the message time tested
[23:08] memorials of god
[23:09] brother brahma say it like this he says
[23:11] the things that you
[23:12] do the words that you say how you
[23:15] treat your neighbor and what you do
[23:18] about christ
[23:19] will be an everlasting memorial you
[23:21] might have a fine home to leave your
[23:23] children
[23:24] you might be working for some livelihood
[23:26] to leave
[23:27] to your children but i'd rather leave
[23:29] them the word of god
[23:31] than anything else those houses
[23:34] will vanish he said that's perfectly all
[23:37] right that's good i have nothing against
[23:38] it
[23:39] but don't do those minor things and
[23:41] leave the great things undone
[23:43] because the word he said or the house
[23:45] will perish
[23:46] and the people will perish with it but
[23:48] the word of god
[23:50] will raise them up in the last days and
[23:52] will give them
[23:53] eternal and immortal life again
[23:57] and that's what god has called us to be
[23:59] is living
[24:00] memorials we could give a lot of things
[24:02] to people but that in itself
[24:04] if we fail that the word of god is
[24:07] what's established in their hearts and
[24:09] minds
[24:10] that because the bible says that teach a
[24:12] child
[24:13] when it's young in the way that it
[24:14] should go and when it's old
[24:16] it will not depart so there must be a
[24:19] standard and sometimes
[24:21] as a parent you can look and say i want
[24:23] to see that standard of the living god
[24:25] inside of that child but remember a
[24:28] standard itself
[24:29] is that to be of a display of that word
[24:32] that image
[24:32] that's on display in our lives that it
[24:35] would be such a living effectual
[24:37] life and a standard that then with no
[24:40] matter what comes or goes
[24:42] there is a living reality that or their
[24:44] heart is always drawn back
[24:46] to to know that there is a god who is
[24:48] alive and well
[24:50] a god who liberates a god who sets free
[24:53] a god who produces a godly life a holy
[24:57] life
[24:57] a god that is alive and well who still
[25:00] feels with the holy ghost to steal heals
[25:02] the sick
[25:03] we are called to be the standard bearers
[25:06] in this hour that god is alive and well
[25:10] we can't do it with a doctrine we can't
[25:12] do it with theology we can't even do it
[25:15] with quotes
[25:16] and scriptures alone it takes the
[25:18] quickening
[25:19] power of god to raise the standard of
[25:22] god
[25:22] above the children of god
[25:26] that's an everlasting eternal and a man
[25:30] a memorial that will stand out before
[25:33] in their lives uh when we look at this
[25:36] here
[25:37] you think of in first timothy 3 14 and i
[25:39] want to
[25:40] just move with this here tonight in
[25:42] first timothy 3 14
[25:44] the bible says these things right unto
[25:46] right eye unto you
[25:48] hoping to come unto thee shortly but if
[25:51] i tarry long
[25:53] that thou mayest know how thou
[25:56] art us to behave thyself in the house of
[25:59] god
[26:00] which is the church of the living god
[26:03] the pillar
[26:04] and ground of the truth
[26:07] now paul is not talking about this
[26:10] building that we have designated and
[26:12] dedicated
[26:13] and called the house of god though this
[26:16] has been designated
[26:18] though there is ways that in here that
[26:21] god has
[26:21] spoke to us of even of how that were to
[26:24] conduct
[26:25] our lives and many of you probably don't
[26:27] realize it but even when i was in
[26:28] jeffersonville there last year
[26:30] different ones would speak they spoke to
[26:32] me of how that there were things that
[26:34] even brother branham himself
[26:35] was picking up on i'm talking about in
[26:37] the earlier ministry
[26:38] and there were things that were
[26:40] corrected in the house of god
[26:42] that you and i can read about and hear
[26:44] about in church order that brother
[26:46] random himself actually had to put in
[26:48] place
[26:48] in the tabernacle see god dealt with the
[26:51] prophet's heart
[26:52] to put it in order that there wouldn't
[26:54] be talking in the sanctuary
[26:56] wouldn't be running around wouldn't be
[26:58] carrying on but this is a place
[27:00] that we reverence i understand it's two
[27:02] by fours or brick or
[27:04] drywall and seats and pews but we
[27:06] reverence this place because this
[27:08] has been reserved as a place for god to
[27:11] come down
[27:12] and to meet with his children to deliver
[27:15] the captives
[27:16] to set them free to heal the sick to
[27:18] feel with the holy ghost
[27:20] this is a place that's designated for
[27:23] god to come
[27:24] and meet with his children and this is
[27:26] why that everything is set the way that
[27:28] it is but
[27:29] paul is not speaking of the building
[27:32] that's made out of bricks and
[27:34] you know drywall and things of this but
[27:36] let me read it again
[27:37] that thou mayest know how thou ought us
[27:40] to behave
[27:40] thyself in the house of god which is the
[27:44] church
[27:44] of the living god the pillar and the
[27:46] ground of truth when i read this i hear
[27:49] brother branham many times as it goes
[27:50] through
[27:51] my mind when i can hear brother branham
[27:53] in the opening of the seals
[27:54] hearing almost every message after the
[27:57] opening of the seals
[27:58] you'll even hear him in earlier messages
[28:00] lord please
[28:01] come lord and teach us lord god
[28:03] revealing your will that we might know
[28:06] how to
[28:07] behave or conduct ourselves in this last
[28:10] days
[28:11] so when we look at this we know it takes
[28:13] a living god
[28:14] because just eagle teaching alone won't
[28:16] do it we need more than just
[28:18] eagle teaching we need the great eagle
[28:21] himself to show up
[28:22] that's what we need the great eagle
[28:24] himself is the one to come and teach us
[28:27] by his manifested presence in our midst
[28:31] and in our lives and without controversy
[28:34] notice
[28:35] great is the mystery of
[28:38] godliness this word godliness here
[28:42] it is that which is of a reverence a
[28:45] respect
[28:46] a piety towards god and godliness
[28:49] so let me read this again and without
[28:51] controversy great is the mystery
[28:54] of godliness this means being filled
[28:56] with god
[28:57] that's what the real mystery of
[28:58] godliness is it's to be filled
[29:00] with god's spirit god was manifest
[29:04] in the flesh justified in the spirit
[29:07] seen of angels preached unto the
[29:09] gentiles believed on in the world
[29:12] and received up into glory so this
[29:15] church that paul is writing about which
[29:18] is
[29:18] the house of golf the church of the
[29:20] living god the pillar in the ground of
[29:22] truth
[29:22] he's talking about the body of believers
[29:26] that has not only been purchased by the
[29:29] blood
[29:29] redeemed but now are divinely placed
[29:33] in the body of jesus christ which is the
[29:36] word of god
[29:37] which is the tabernacle of god which is
[29:40] the bride of jesus christ now i want you
[29:43] to look at this here in the scripture
[29:45] in revelations 3 12 him that overcometh
[29:49] will i make a pillar in the temple of my
[29:52] god
[29:52] i love this in scripture we could just
[29:54] run with this all night god does not ask
[29:56] you or me
[29:56] to make ourselves because we cannot make
[29:59] ourselves
[30:00] but he if we can yield of ourselves to
[30:02] him
[30:03] he's the one that makes new creation
[30:06] he's the one that comes on the scene and
[30:08] he's the one that
[30:09] makes us from a bound man to a free man
[30:13] he's the one that makes us what we
[30:16] really are
[30:17] notice him will i make a pillar
[30:21] in the temple of my god and he shall
[30:24] go out go no more out and i will write
[30:27] upon him the name of my god
[30:29] and the name of the city of my god which
[30:32] is new jerusalem which cometh down
[30:34] out of heaven from god and i will write
[30:36] upon him my new name
[30:38] lord have mercy which he now has been
[30:41] placed
[30:41] and made a temple in the pillar of my
[30:43] god god said my
[30:45] identification will be all
[30:48] over his life i will write my
[30:52] name all over his life matter of fact
[30:55] where he is dwelling will be reflected
[30:59] through his life
[31:01] glory be to god in the highest so this
[31:03] would take more than just a message book
[31:05] underneath an arm
[31:08] this takes the life of jesus christ on
[31:11] display
[31:12] notice now he is not only giving look
[31:14] how brother brown words this he's not
[31:16] only giving crowns but he says
[31:18] that these in the bride will be pillars
[31:22] in the temple of god but what is the
[31:25] temple of god
[31:26] jesus spoke of his body as being the
[31:29] temple
[31:30] it was it was the temple of god but
[31:33] now that we are his body
[31:36] the church is the temple of god
[31:40] by the holy ghost within us so what
[31:43] sets us as the temple of god or the body
[31:47] of jesus christ
[31:48] is by the holy spirit dwelling within
[31:51] us so it's not what we say
[31:54] but it's god himself because of him
[31:57] divinely
[31:58] placing us in him and his life
[32:01] his name the characteristic of that new
[32:05] jerusalem
[32:06] which is his own life pulsating in the
[32:08] believer
[32:09] it is a divine witness that our life
[32:12] is under the influence of almighty god
[32:16] because our action is god our talking is
[32:19] god
[32:19] our thinking is god everything about our
[32:22] life it beats out
[32:23] jesus christ holy holy holy
[32:26] lord god almighty hallelujah
[32:30] but now that we are his body the true
[32:33] church
[32:34] is the temple of god by the holy ghost
[32:37] within us
[32:37] now he's going to make the overcomer a
[32:40] pillar in that temple
[32:42] but what's a pillar a pillar now a
[32:44] pillar in you know for kentucky it ain't
[32:46] what you have on your bed
[32:47] but what is a pillar a pillar is
[32:49] actually
[32:50] a part of the foundation for it holds up
[32:54] the superstructure oh my
[32:58] look what he said praise god that puts
[33:01] the overcomer
[33:02] right in with the apostles and
[33:05] prophets glory be to god amen
[33:09] right there in with the apostles and the
[33:12] prophets you're part of
[33:13] the superstructure
[33:16] we didn't receive a weak down gospel or
[33:19] watered down of it just barely got
[33:21] enough power to
[33:22] every once in a while bring you to the
[33:23] house of god you're missing it
[33:25] that is not what the holy ghost does the
[33:28] holy ghost just does not it's not a
[33:30] trickle of
[33:31] well you know i might be able to live a
[33:33] victorious life that's not what it does
[33:35] the holy ghost is the victory to the
[33:38] church
[33:39] of the living god it is the victory that
[33:42] reigns
[33:42] in the heart of the believer that sounds
[33:45] out he is the mighty conqueror he has
[33:47] put all things
[33:48] under his feet it is the victory that
[33:52] sounds out to the church of the living
[33:54] god that what god
[33:55] was back there he still the same god
[33:59] right here tonight and you are
[34:01] represented by being placed
[34:03] as a pillar in the super structure
[34:07] glory be to god oh my look what paul
[34:11] look out
[34:11] brother ram will go into this in
[34:12] ephesians 2 19
[34:14] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[34:17] and foreigners
[34:18] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[34:21] of the household
[34:22] of god and are built upon the foundation
[34:26] of the apostles and prophets
[34:28] jesus christ himself being the chief
[34:30] cornerstone
[34:32] in whom all the building fitly framed
[34:34] together
[34:35] groweth unto an holy temple
[34:38] in the lord in whom ye are also
[34:41] build it together for inhabitation
[34:44] of god through the spirit now
[34:48] probably you know that when you go back
[34:49] and read about in solomon's temple
[34:52] there are pillars that solomon placed in
[34:54] that temple and there are two that are
[34:56] distinct
[34:56] that he names one he writes the name of
[34:59] boaz on one
[35:00] and writes the name of jason on another
[35:02] but that of jason means
[35:04] he will establish and that of boaz
[35:07] by his power so god establishes
[35:11] the believer as a pillar in the temple
[35:14] of the living god
[35:16] by his power glory be to god
[35:20] now notice he says we are building
[35:22] together with them
[35:24] everything went through the door jesus
[35:27] and is a part of that body or temple
[35:31] now when god puts a man in the temple
[35:34] as a pillar and makes him part of that
[35:36] foundation group
[35:38] what is he doing he is giving him the
[35:41] revelation of the word
[35:43] and of himself because that is exactly
[35:45] what the apostles
[35:47] and prophets had and he goes into that
[35:49] in matthew 16.
[35:50] look at him look what he says here there
[35:52] he is in that word
[35:53] talking about you and me there he stands
[35:56] and no one can get him out there ain't
[35:59] enough youtube videos
[36:01] there ain't enough devils there ain't
[36:02] enough demons there ain't enough tests
[36:04] they're in enough trials you've been
[36:06] sealed in there
[36:08] you're a pillar in the temple of
[36:10] almighty god
[36:11] when you're going through a test the
[36:13] name of jesus christ
[36:15] is on display in your life when you're
[36:17] going through situations
[36:19] and in everything there is a display
[36:21] that i
[36:22] am just a pilgrim and a stranger here in
[36:25] this
[36:26] i am a citizen of another land
[36:29] of another country not only do i got the
[36:32] passport
[36:33] but i got my visa i've received the
[36:36] token
[36:36] that the deed has been cleared i've got
[36:39] all my
[36:40] shots my vaccines i've been immunized
[36:43] against sin
[36:45] [Music]
[36:45] [Applause]
[36:47] glory glory i love that scripture him
[36:51] that overcometh will i make a pillar in
[36:54] the temple of my god
[36:56] and he shall go no more out
[37:01] there's no more desire amen
[37:04] to go out
[37:11] the desire is to dwell in his presence
[37:16] hallelujah look one legion when legion
[37:18] was
[37:19] delivered look where you find him the
[37:22] next reading
[37:23] at jesus feet is that right
[37:26] he wanted to get in the boat with jesus
[37:28] but jesus said no
[37:30] you stay here and i want you to go
[37:32] publish go
[37:33] preach tell your friends what the mercy
[37:36] of god
[37:37] has done for your life hallelujah
[37:40] who man who was once held in the tombs
[37:43] and
[37:43] out in there and bound with devils but
[37:46] now became a walking display
[37:48] and billboard of the power of god to
[37:51] announce
[37:51] that there is one person here on earth
[37:54] according to the promises
[37:56] that he made there's a god on earth that
[37:59] can take care of your situation
[38:04] a god on earth who's bigger than every
[38:06] devil in every demon
[38:13] so here in the scripture paul goes on to
[38:17] say
[38:19] that we are god's building many places
[38:21] that paul
[38:22] would would write of this under
[38:24] inspiration because remember when jesus
[38:27] would say upon this rock i'll build my
[38:30] church which is
[38:31] the revelation of himself to the
[38:34] individual
[38:36] amen that revelation of himself to the
[38:39] individual
[38:40] that's the new birth that's the
[38:42] quickening power
[38:43] that comes upon that life to really
[38:45] change them
[38:46] and transform them then you can say from
[38:49] your heart
[38:49] that indeed jesus is lord
[38:53] amen he become the lord of our life and
[38:56] here we are dwelling
[38:58] in the very tabernacle of god in the
[39:01] temple of god
[39:02] we are part of the body of god
[39:05] and so with that in that body the same
[39:07] way that he did in his earthly body
[39:09] it's the same way that he does in his
[39:11] earthly body now for he said
[39:13] that the works that i do shall you do
[39:16] also
[39:17] so the same life that he lived he now
[39:20] comes
[39:21] and lives through a mini-membered body
[39:24] hallelujah and as we've looked at that
[39:26] god wasn't trying to get in our flesh
[39:28] he wasn't even trying to get in our
[39:30] spirit and a matter of fact he didn't
[39:32] even want to marry our old nature
[39:34] he wanted to kill it so he could raise
[39:37] up that virgin womb
[39:38] on the inside that which was dead that
[39:41] is the
[39:42] body that god has prepared for me
[39:46] that which god himself has laid out in
[39:49] this earth
[39:49] just like when you dropped from your
[39:51] mother's womb that seed
[39:53] was already in you there ain't nobody
[39:56] put that seed in you
[39:58] god put that seed in you that's why the
[40:01] prophet could say it's that it was that
[40:03] g that found you
[40:07] hallelujah that's where we take it off
[40:09] the works of man
[40:10] and it comes back to the sovereignty of
[40:12] almighty god
[40:14] it was not us seeking after god it was
[40:16] god
[40:17] seeking after you and me god did not
[40:20] need anybody
[40:21] to provide himself a house but god has
[40:24] provided a house for himself
[40:26] he gave a vision to moses and moses
[40:29] built the house according to the divine
[40:32] pattern and what happened
[40:33] the pillar of fire came let me tell you
[40:36] something when the pattern of the word
[40:38] is preached with the power of the holy
[40:41] ghost it will draw
[40:42] the seed gene of god into a position
[40:46] that the pillar of fire will come right
[40:48] down
[40:49] and dwell in the light and take that
[40:52] life
[40:52] that was groping in darkness and place
[40:55] them in the shekinah life
[40:56] as a pillar in the temple of my god
[40:59] [Applause]
[41:02] glory be to god in the highest amen
[41:05] that's whose house
[41:06] we are we're made to be inhabited by god
[41:11] you are the church of the living god
[41:15] hallelujah brother braham said it like
[41:18] this and why christ speak
[41:19] there's there is only only one real
[41:22] church
[41:23] and you don't join it you're born in it
[41:27] and if you're born in it the living god
[41:29] works himself
[41:30] through you making himself
[41:34] known that's where god dwells in his
[41:37] church
[41:38] oh my i like this god goes to church
[41:41] every day
[41:42] he don't go to church some days and
[41:44] stream other days
[41:46] streaming ain't an option with jesus
[41:49] come on now that's an old roman catholic
[41:51] spirit that wants to creep around the
[41:53] message
[41:54] i'm going to preach it that's a roman
[41:56] catholic spirit
[41:58] my wife and i were going one to one
[42:00] saturday night and we went over we were
[42:02] had to go out i had to go get something
[42:03] around in avon or whatever more
[42:05] and we come down that one roadway i
[42:07] don't know if it might be 254
[42:09] and there was one of them great big
[42:10] spooky morgues on the corner right there
[42:12] i might be on the corner nagel road or
[42:14] however you pronounce it and i looked
[42:16] and man here was saturday night
[42:17] my wife said why in the world is all
[42:19] those cars parked around that church
[42:21] i said that's called convenience
[42:23] religion
[42:25] it's convenient for them to go on
[42:26] saturday night because they're too busy
[42:29] for sunday come on friends
[42:32] when you're too busy to get in the house
[42:34] of god you're
[42:35] too busy i'm going to preach
[42:40] god goes to church every day and you
[42:42] know what he carries those
[42:44] with him to church oh god goes to church
[42:47] every day
[42:48] he just lives in church now that's how
[42:50] brother bran's place in this
[42:51] he lives in you you're his church
[42:55] you are his church you are the
[42:57] tabernacle that god dwells in
[42:59] you are the church of the living god
[43:01] yourself now i know there's no doubt
[43:03] there's people that can take it and run
[43:05] off anyway
[43:06] but you see the scripture will always
[43:08] right here
[43:09] the forsaken not to assemble ourselves
[43:12] together
[43:13] and i'm sorry i don't believe in
[43:15] computer chairs or a way to assemble
[43:17] together
[43:19] i'm just going to preach it that's not
[43:21] an option god is gone all of a sudden
[43:23] the rapture itself is going to be a
[43:26] gathering together that's what's taking
[43:28] place
[43:29] right now there's got to be efforts
[43:31] that's put in
[43:32] to be to the house of god when you don't
[43:35] feel like coming to the house of god
[43:37] that's the very time to come to the
[43:39] house of god you don't know what kind of
[43:41] trouble i'm in
[43:42] that ought to make you say i need to get
[43:44] there
[43:45] more than anything else because my help
[43:47] cometh
[43:48] from the lord oh glory be to god
[43:56] well that was free and if the living god
[44:00] lives in his living being
[44:04] then your action is of god
[44:07] if it isn't then god isn't there
[44:10] he wouldn't make you act like that when
[44:13] he says in his word here his blueprint
[44:15] don't do that you go do it see that's
[44:18] wrong when you deny it
[44:19] then that shows that the life isn't even
[44:22] in you so
[44:23] the life of the holy spirit it brings an
[44:26] action
[44:26] in our life it becomes the pulsation it
[44:29] is the
[44:30] will in the middle of the wheel it's
[44:33] what moves us
[44:34] forward that's why when god told us in
[44:36] the book of ezekiel
[44:37] a couple places and speaking of that of
[44:40] the real birth
[44:41] he said he would give us a new spirit
[44:43] thank god for that new spirit
[44:44] he'd give us a new heart thank god for
[44:46] that that's all necessary
[44:48] preparation that he said then i will
[44:52] give them my spirit and i will
[44:55] cause them to keep my way that ain't god
[44:58] driving us but now comes a change
[45:01] on the inside of our life where our
[45:04] desires are changed
[45:05] this you see the battle itself is not
[45:08] out here
[45:08] if the battle is down here once that
[45:11] battle right there
[45:12] once it is announced in your heart that
[45:14] the victory is over
[45:16] the battle's been won you recognize i
[45:19] was included
[45:20] in that victory on calvary and now that
[45:22] victory
[45:23] it reigns in your life and now you reign
[45:25] as an overcomer
[45:27] through that power on the inside of your
[45:30] life
[45:32] glory be to god sure there's temptations
[45:34] but
[45:35] greater is he that is in you than he
[45:38] that's in the world
[45:39] this is why when we look at here our
[45:42] lives and how we
[45:44] are living and walking and and
[45:47] and dwelling in jesus christ dwelling in
[45:49] the word
[45:50] the bible tells us that when the
[45:53] comforter has come
[45:55] this is what he would do in verse 8 he
[45:57] will reprove
[45:59] that means to bring conviction
[46:03] he's the one that brings conviction he
[46:05] reproves the world of sin
[46:07] of righteousness and a judgment and you
[46:09] see
[46:10] it's a conviction on the inside of us
[46:13] it's a holy spirit
[46:14] that brings conviction there's there's a
[46:16] there's a change that comes about
[46:18] in a believer's life when he has come
[46:20] there's convictions that you're walking
[46:22] by
[46:22] that your life is is a pleasing unto
[46:26] the lord look how the scripture says it
[46:29] in philippians 3 20
[46:30] for our conversation this deals with our
[46:34] our constitution that we live by that
[46:37] which
[46:37] is is what what directs our life
[46:41] for our conversation is in heaven
[46:44] from whence also we look for the savior
[46:48] the lord jesus christ who shall change
[46:51] our vile body that it might be fashioned
[46:55] like unto his glorious body
[46:58] according to the working whereby he is
[47:01] able even to subdue
[47:02] all things unto himself
[47:06] he's working even now in our lives
[47:09] to subdue all things unto himself
[47:12] amen our life has been you see
[47:15] there's no way that we could match up
[47:17] with that character of life
[47:20] there was nobody on earth that could
[47:22] match that character of life
[47:25] the earth was combed even underneath the
[47:28] earth
[47:29] it was looked for who is able to take
[47:31] the book
[47:33] who's able what character can be
[47:35] produced and there was found
[47:37] no character but here came the lamb
[47:41] himself there's no other character
[47:44] that could be produced but other than
[47:47] god's character
[47:48] it was god's character of his life that
[47:51] would come
[47:52] to you and i and would bring a
[47:54] transformation
[47:55] in our life not by unwillingness but by
[47:57] him drawing us
[47:59] into a place of complete surrender
[48:03] is that right and the same god that
[48:05] brought a change in our life
[48:07] whereby that we are living by the word
[48:10] we're not living by the word of the
[48:12] church we're living by the word of god
[48:14] let me tell you something this message
[48:17] is not an
[48:18] earthly message this message itself
[48:21] is that sounding of the third angel
[48:24] flying through the heavens
[48:25] come out of babylon and as that was
[48:28] sounding out
[48:29] the bible said i heard a voice from
[48:31] heaven saying come out of here
[48:33] and brother ram tells us he said what it
[48:35] is is that angel
[48:36] that was sounding on earth was so
[48:39] inclined
[48:40] with god if heaven roared back
[48:43] the same thing
[48:47] let me announce to you we are inclined
[48:49] with god
[48:50] to speak in this hour we are inclined
[48:54] with god
[48:55] in this hour there is not a voice of a
[48:57] man
[48:58] that's backing us up it's the voice of
[49:01] god
[49:02] in our lives heaven is backing up
[49:05] the word
[49:07] [Applause]
[49:09] hallelujah and that same reality
[49:14] that brought a transformation and a
[49:16] change in our life
[49:18] it's going to change these mortal bodies
[49:21] [Music]
[49:23] the picture is being developed
[49:28] oh it'll be better than anything
[49:29] polaroid could ever do anything better
[49:31] than anything iphone or ever do
[49:33] it'll be the i am bringing us to him
[49:37] oh glory be to god notice paul would
[49:40] write in colossians 3 15
[49:42] and let the peace of god rule
[49:45] let him be the umpire well you know when
[49:48] we're in a
[49:50] whether a baseball game or whatever
[49:51] you're in some some type of a sport or
[49:54] whatever more
[49:55] there is somebody there it ain't like
[49:57] backyard where you make your own little
[49:59] rules up and
[50:00] when we got south of rain rules and we
[50:01] got west over here and south amherst
[50:03] rules and
[50:04] no no when you play the game you're
[50:06] going to play according to the rules
[50:08] are you with me so when we look at this
[50:11] the peace of god let the peace of god be
[50:14] the umpire
[50:16] be the ultimate be the absolute in
[50:20] your hearts you see it's just like this
[50:22] when it comes
[50:23] let it be the peace of god that stands
[50:26] there as the
[50:27] umpire to say out right
[50:30] or the peace of god that can stand there
[50:33] and say
[50:34] go forward let it be the peace of god
[50:36] that rules
[50:38] in here to the which you're also called
[50:41] in one body and be you thankful let the
[50:44] word of christ
[50:46] dwell in you richly
[50:49] in all wisdom this word dwell means to
[50:52] dwell
[50:53] in one and influence him for the good
[50:58] i'll just say it to you like this i
[51:00] believe that a life can live
[51:02] so close to god that the devil don't
[51:05] know what to do
[51:07] let me tell you i believe that we can
[51:08] live so close to god
[51:10] that the spirit of god is not greed
[51:13] are you hearing me i believe that you
[51:16] say well how can that be possible
[51:18] by the life by the power of the holy
[51:21] ghost that we are established
[51:23] in the tabernacle of the living god
[51:27] that i believe with all my heart that
[51:28] living in the presence of god
[51:30] that it don't mean that things won't
[51:31] want to try to stick but i believe
[51:33] that there is rich honey that flows down
[51:38] to the great pyramid of god i believe
[51:41] that that the love of god
[51:42] it can be so thick and our hearts can be
[51:45] so bound in the love of god
[51:46] i believe that this is a reality of a
[51:49] living experience
[51:51] with jesus christ you know how we get
[51:52] pricky sometimes
[51:54] you know how we get our feelings and
[51:55] everything been out of shape because
[51:56] we're not
[51:57] living in the presence of god the way
[52:00] that we ought to
[52:01] it isn't because well brother samuel you
[52:03] don't know someone saw offending me
[52:04] so-and-so did this
[52:05] so and so did that but let me tell you
[52:07] something there is power
[52:09] in the life of almighty god if we will
[52:12] stay
[52:13] in his presence and staying in there and
[52:15] feasting
[52:16] it and laying before him there's a
[52:18] strength in there brother
[52:20] that we don't have to be sprayed with
[52:22] insect repellent
[52:24] or repel this or tell that we don't have
[52:26] to be sprayed with that
[52:28] you've got to spray of eternal life
[52:30] that's
[52:31] passing through that seed gene if you
[52:33] just let god have the right away
[52:38] i don't believe these are stories when
[52:39] brother ran would let us in on his
[52:41] private life
[52:42] and people would go to run him down and
[52:43] run down his family and brother bran
[52:44] would say let him alone
[52:46] he said god predestinated that
[52:49] and brother then bro you know and here
[52:51] the brother said how in the world
[52:52] can you stand and take it like that
[52:56] oh my teaching and admonishing one
[52:59] another in psalms and hymns and
[53:00] spiritual songs singing with grace in
[53:02] your hearts to the lord
[53:04] and whatsoever ye do in word
[53:07] or deed do all in the name
[53:11] of the lord jesus giving thanks to god
[53:14] and the father by him it's pretty simple
[53:17] amen
[53:18] if you can't do it in his name don't do
[53:20] it
[53:23] if you can't do it if you can't if you
[53:25] can't speak it and speak it in his name
[53:27] then don't do it
[53:30] hallelujah now let me just i'm going to
[53:33] move i'm just going to skip over a part
[53:35] here
[53:36] and i want to just say it like this here
[53:38] true honor
[53:40] because we're not talking about the
[53:41] false honor we're not talking about
[53:45] well if you know you like me i like you
[53:47] that's
[53:48] that's nonsense that's a false harmony
[53:51] this is what the pharisees were doing
[53:52] they wanted to scratch one another's
[53:54] back
[53:55] they were honoring one another so we're
[53:57] talking about a true honor
[53:59] and a true honor itself is what honors
[54:03] the lord in all things we can honor god
[54:07] even in the midst of a time
[54:09] in a situation where we've been
[54:10] dishonest
[54:13] that's a real test because you say well
[54:16] how can i honor god
[54:17] when i've been dishonored because god
[54:19] has given in his word
[54:21] the direction and listen god's desire by
[54:24] his spirit
[54:25] is that our life would remain open and
[54:27] pleasing
[54:28] unto him hallelujah
[54:32] think of this true honor begets true
[54:34] honor
[54:35] respect begets respect love
[54:39] begets love patience will beget patience
[54:42] now brother brown would take this and
[54:44] is your life worthy the gospel temper
[54:46] breeds temper and love brings love and
[54:48] brother brown also gives the member who
[54:49] he addresses the one sister that now
[54:52] through her whole house and nervousness
[54:53] is through the whole house among the
[54:54] family brother
[54:55] said see what it is he said keep your
[54:57] thoughts on
[54:59] christ because he said one thinking like
[55:02] that
[55:02] it can just it could just move you see
[55:03] because thoughts themselves just aren't
[55:05] well that's just a thought
[55:06] it's a spirit
[55:09] it's a spirit that's wanting to encroach
[55:11] or a spirit that
[55:13] maybe something would be suggested to
[55:15] you and then it would want to try to
[55:16] bring
[55:17] fear in your life or to bring
[55:18] uncertainty what do i do
[55:20] stand there and the good man of faith
[55:22] that's on the inside
[55:24] says and don't accept what you are
[55:27] saying
[55:28] because you're a liar
[55:32] lord be to god patience begets patience
[55:35] so
[55:36] then on the contrary side rudeness would
[55:37] beget rudeness
[55:39] on and on it goes is that right
[55:43] you see when the bible says that god
[55:45] gives the holy ghost to them that obey
[55:47] him
[55:47] it shows when you honor god
[55:51] he'll honor you with his presence
[55:55] god honors those who honor his word
[55:59] hallelujah his word his word is the
[56:02] expression of himself
[56:04] and anything that's contrary his
[56:07] presence will pull back
[56:10] and as believers were were built to be
[56:12] sensitive to them want you to look how
[56:16] paul would write this here in the next
[56:18] just over a few moments paul said i
[56:20] exhort
[56:21] therefore that first of all first
[56:23] timothy 2 1
[56:25] supplications prayers intercessions
[56:28] and giving of things be made for all
[56:32] men for kings and for all
[56:35] that are in authority that we may lead a
[56:39] quiet and peaceable life
[56:41] in all godliness and honesty
[56:45] and notice how paul's bringing this down
[56:47] he's not saying
[56:49] and not admonishing that well we need to
[56:51] get wrapped up with what the latest
[56:53] thing that's going on
[56:54] but the purpose notice why are we
[56:57] praying
[56:58] about these things are you hearing me
[57:02] what's the purpose so that we might lead
[57:05] a
[57:05] quiet and peaceable life
[57:09] paul would say follow peace with all men
[57:12] is that right you see the holy spirit
[57:15] will not come
[57:16] with us where peace is not out
[57:19] he will not come in an atmosphere this
[57:21] is why the enemy have you ever watched
[57:23] how
[57:24] that satan will try to come at you even
[57:26] on a thursday
[57:27] he'll try to come at you even on a
[57:30] sunday
[57:31] are you with me you know why because he
[57:33] knows if he can get
[57:34] everything so tore up but what god has
[57:38] for you
[57:39] you can actually miss it so paul is
[57:42] saying
[57:43] paul is not instructing us neither did
[57:46] brother random instructors say
[57:47] i want you to pray that miracle will be
[57:49] turned around
[57:50] that's not what we're praying about
[57:52] we're praying that we might lead a quiet
[57:55] and peaceable life not that oh my that
[57:57] my bank account might be blessed
[57:59] that ain't what he's talking about this
[58:01] is talking about
[58:03] seek ye first that the gospel might have
[58:06] the right of way
[58:07] in our lives but while we're here that
[58:10] god
[58:11] would make a way that's why we're not to
[58:13] be entangled up
[58:16] why do that in all godliness and all
[58:19] honesty
[58:20] through prayer not through getting
[58:22] around
[58:23] and getting around and pow-wowing about
[58:25] it and getting around this and get
[58:27] look there's just as much nonsense on
[58:29] the right as there is on the left
[58:31] whether you say a man or not i'll keep
[58:33] preaching it there's as much nonsense on
[58:36] the right
[58:36] as there is the left there's stuff
[58:38] that's set there as
[58:40] traps to try to ensnare people's lives
[58:43] what should i do get your eyes set on
[58:46] where you're going
[58:47] forget about all of that you can't
[58:49] control it anyhow
[58:50] but through prayer god can give you
[58:53] grace
[58:54] to live a quiet and peaceable life you
[58:57] have a right to that amen well i'm not
[59:00] up there in congress to vote
[59:02] but i still believe in prayer
[59:05] amen amen hallelujah not prayer to turn
[59:09] it around
[59:10] are you hearing me that's not at all so
[59:13] this is where this scripture
[59:14] still remains in effect for this
[59:18] is good look what he says for this is
[59:20] good and acceptable
[59:22] to all who are on my facebook page
[59:26] no that's a braggart for this is good
[59:28] and acceptable
[59:30] in the sight of god our savior now
[59:32] remember in his sight
[59:34] it's what he's looking down on the
[59:35] inside now when we say here
[59:38] but what's on the inside who will have
[59:41] all men
[59:43] to be saved and to come unto the
[59:46] knowledge of the truth
[59:51] i don't know you ain't seen some of the
[59:52] characters we were characters
[59:55] some of us were characters some riding
[59:58] their bikes and everything else and
[1:00:00] had all their leather things on and my
[1:00:02] goodness we were some of us were some
[1:00:03] real characters
[1:00:04] some of us were some message kid
[1:00:07] characters
[1:00:11] come on now but god his desire
[1:00:15] and listen to me it's god's desire as it
[1:00:18] says
[1:00:18] who will have all men to be saved will
[1:00:21] all men be saved
[1:00:22] no but god's desire
[1:00:25] that's right is that all would be
[1:00:29] he has no hands but our hands
[1:00:34] no feet but our feet and to come unto
[1:00:36] the knowledge of the truth
[1:00:37] for there is one god and one mediator
[1:00:39] between god and man
[1:00:40] the man christ jesus who gave himself
[1:00:44] a ransom for all to be testified in due
[1:00:46] time
[1:00:48] did you think of that if god had not
[1:00:50] become one of us
[1:00:52] then there would be no way that we could
[1:00:53] be brought into the household of god
[1:00:58] someone had to be the redeemer and that
[1:01:01] was god
[1:01:02] himself notice how paul would write this
[1:01:06] here
[1:01:06] in first timothy 6 1 let us many
[1:01:09] servants now in here in the church
[1:01:11] when paul is dealing with this i want to
[1:01:12] just look at this here a little bit just
[1:01:14] just
[1:01:14] just over the next few moments here
[1:01:16] notice how paul was dealing with this
[1:01:18] paul's got a setting of where
[1:01:19] there is servants and masters and and
[1:01:21] things and it isn't even the way that we
[1:01:23] even in our
[1:01:24] country would even think about it but
[1:01:26] even at times when i've went
[1:01:28] overseas and been in other places it's
[1:01:30] nothing for people to have
[1:01:32] someone in the house who takes care of
[1:01:34] all the groceries who takes care of all
[1:01:36] the cleaning
[1:01:36] who takes care of all those other things
[1:01:38] i know some of you are thinking let me
[1:01:40] get signed up with this
[1:01:42] but you see it's not that the viewpoint
[1:01:45] of it
[1:01:45] is not necessarily how we and ourselves
[1:01:48] would look at now watch what paul says
[1:01:50] first timothy 6 1 let as many servants
[1:01:53] as
[1:01:53] are under the yoke meaning that they are
[1:01:56] a servant
[1:01:57] count their own masters worthy
[1:02:01] of all honor now he's not talking about
[1:02:04] whether or not the master
[1:02:05] is a believer or not but he said let
[1:02:08] them count
[1:02:09] think deem worthy
[1:02:13] of all honor
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:17] that the name of god notice this
[1:02:19] remember that the name of god that which
[1:02:21] is
[1:02:21] roped on the pillar of god that the name
[1:02:25] of god
[1:02:26] and his doctrine be not blasphemed
[1:02:33] so let that be steamed and worthy of
[1:02:36] honor that
[1:02:37] the doctrine be not the name of god or
[1:02:39] the doctrine be not blasphemed or evil
[1:02:41] spoken
[1:02:42] and they that have believing masters let
[1:02:45] them not
[1:02:46] despise them because they are brethren
[1:02:51] can you imagine that sitting right in
[1:02:54] the same pew
[1:02:56] your master and here you are a servant
[1:03:00] sat right next to him and the spirit of
[1:03:02] god
[1:03:03] would come across and not addre and not
[1:03:05] address the master and say
[1:03:07] you turned them loose
[1:03:11] everybody okay tonight
[1:03:15] and they that have believing masters let
[1:03:17] them not
[1:03:19] despise them because
[1:03:22] they are brethren but rather do them
[1:03:24] service
[1:03:25] because they are faithful and beloved
[1:03:28] partakers of the benefit
[1:03:30] these things teach and exhort
[1:03:33] so this wasn't just things to say well
[1:03:36] you know
[1:03:36] we're just we're just in trust and there
[1:03:38] are many things that we do entrust the
[1:03:40] spirit of god
[1:03:41] because god himself remember he will
[1:03:43] teach a life
[1:03:44] in the way of holiness and the holy
[1:03:46] spirit itself
[1:03:47] it takes and makes a life teachable to
[1:03:50] where
[1:03:51] that the spirit of god is able to so
[1:03:53] move within a person's life
[1:03:55] that their character is now molded
[1:03:58] by the character of light that has come
[1:04:01] down
[1:04:02] into that seed on the inside it is
[1:04:04] molded
[1:04:05] to reflect the lord of glory
[1:04:08] these things teach and exhort if any man
[1:04:12] notice how paul would write this if any
[1:04:13] man teach otherwise
[1:04:15] and consent not to wholesome words even
[1:04:17] the words of our lord jesus christ
[1:04:19] and to the doctrine which is according
[1:04:22] to godliness
[1:04:24] he is proud knowing nothing
[1:04:27] doting about questions and stripes of
[1:04:29] words wherewith cometh envy strife
[1:04:32] railings and evil surmising sounds
[1:04:34] pretty peaceful don't it
[1:04:37] perverse disputings of men of corrupt
[1:04:40] minds and destitute of the truth
[1:04:42] supposing that gain is godliness
[1:04:46] from such withdraw
[1:04:49] thy self
[1:04:53] so to miss a paul is dealing to miss the
[1:04:56] display
[1:04:58] of the true character of god's own life
[1:05:00] coming
[1:05:01] in to that life by the holy ghost
[1:05:06] and being placed in our lives to govern
[1:05:08] our lives to direct
[1:05:10] our lives then truly the real doctrine
[1:05:13] of godliness has been misplaced
[1:05:18] so the truth the truth itself you know a
[1:05:21] person can say well we've got the truth
[1:05:23] but the truth ain't a book
[1:05:27] well we got the truth the truth ain't
[1:05:28] the tape that's right
[1:05:30] the truth is the person
[1:05:34] of jesus christ he said i
[1:05:37] am the lay the truth and
[1:05:40] the light and he said
[1:05:44] that you shall know the son and the son
[1:05:47] shall
[1:05:48] make you free indeed
[1:05:51] not set you free but he comes to change
[1:05:54] you
[1:05:55] make a new creation out of you he makes
[1:05:58] you free
[1:05:59] by the birth of the holy ghost in your
[1:06:01] life you now
[1:06:02] are a new creation you have been made
[1:06:05] free
[1:06:06] from the law of sin and death
[1:06:09] is that right and now christ himself is
[1:06:11] the center of our lives
[1:06:14] paul would write in the book of titus
[1:06:16] exhort servants
[1:06:18] to be obedient unto their even unto
[1:06:20] their own masters
[1:06:21] and to please them well in all things
[1:06:25] not answering again this word
[1:06:28] answering means don't speak against gain
[1:06:31] say
[1:06:32] contradict to oppose oneself decline to
[1:06:35] obey
[1:06:36] declare oneself against him refuse to
[1:06:38] have anything you do
[1:06:40] with him now you understand i can't go
[1:06:43] here tonight
[1:06:44] the scripture says many things as is fit
[1:06:47] in the lord
[1:06:48] are you with me the same man
[1:06:52] peter could say submit yourselves unto
[1:06:54] every ordinance a man
[1:06:56] is the same peter that stood here after
[1:06:58] the day of pentecost when they want to
[1:07:00] shut them down
[1:07:01] and he said we're going to obey god's
[1:07:03] word and not yours
[1:07:05] that takes a discernment of the holy
[1:07:07] ghost he was not dishonoring them
[1:07:10] he was honoring the word in every place
[1:07:14] when he said submit yourself to every
[1:07:16] ordinance he was honoring
[1:07:17] god's word is that right jesus said give
[1:07:20] unto caesar
[1:07:21] what belongs to caesar but give unto god
[1:07:24] what belongs to god
[1:07:26] is that right and he was honoring god
[1:07:28] when they said you got to shut the
[1:07:30] church down
[1:07:30] and peter said we're not listening to
[1:07:33] you we're going to listen to god
[1:07:38] i'll save that for another time but i
[1:07:40] just i had to want to put that in there
[1:07:42] as it comes to me
[1:07:43] this is something not answering again in
[1:07:45] other words
[1:07:46] when things are even asked of us or
[1:07:49] things that are done
[1:07:50] that there be not a gain saying or a
[1:07:52] contradicting
[1:07:53] you know how it is you all have been in
[1:07:55] places where your boss or your principal
[1:07:57] or whoever it is
[1:07:58] me personally friends look has there
[1:08:01] been times that when i worked that there
[1:08:02] were things decisions i disagreed with
[1:08:04] you better believe it were there things
[1:08:06] that i looked at and said
[1:08:08] i think this could have been done a
[1:08:09] better way yes but
[1:08:11] here's the part of it there's a part
[1:08:13] probably that i don't see
[1:08:15] and if even if that is that or a
[1:08:17] decision is being made
[1:08:18] and they're having to make this decision
[1:08:20] or whatever more what good does it do
[1:08:23] to get my spirit all tore up there are
[1:08:26] people when i
[1:08:27] talked that i would purposely some of
[1:08:29] y'all know this i would keep like a
[1:08:31] stack
[1:08:31] of folders that absolutely had nothing
[1:08:34] to do
[1:08:35] with nothing they had papers in them and
[1:08:38] everything else and when i saw some of
[1:08:40] them people
[1:08:41] that all they wanted to do was gather
[1:08:43] around in the room
[1:08:44] and run down the principle or talk about
[1:08:47] this and
[1:08:47] how could the superintendent do this i
[1:08:49] don't got time for that nonsense
[1:08:52] i have a family i want to get home to it
[1:08:54] and i don't want to be
[1:08:56] packed full of junk of what you've got
[1:08:58] to say
[1:08:59] because listen to me critical spirits
[1:09:02] in the workplace if you don't stop from
[1:09:04] there
[1:09:05] they'll come home with you you'll be
[1:09:07] critical in your house
[1:09:09] it don't stop there it'll come right
[1:09:11] among brothers and sisters
[1:09:13] it keeps going but you're the one to say
[1:09:17] not here so brother brian what'd i do
[1:09:21] when i saw one of them i felt like boy
[1:09:23] you can hear them outside the room
[1:09:24] i just picked that up and i walked down
[1:09:26] what were you doing i act like i was
[1:09:28] getting ready to go copy papers
[1:09:33] why didn't you just tell them it didn't
[1:09:35] do no good
[1:09:38] i wanted to save a little bit of time
[1:09:40] because i had work that i needed to do
[1:09:42] in my room
[1:09:45] oh my you know how it is people boy i'm
[1:09:47] saying they can get on and my goodness
[1:09:49] but
[1:09:49] anyhow we're believers we're not out of
[1:09:53] this world
[1:09:56] now brother samuel where there was there
[1:09:57] must have been a time you never got
[1:09:59] caught up in that
[1:09:59] no there were some times that i sure did
[1:10:03] sometimes there's some things that i
[1:10:04] thought very this decision
[1:10:06] where in the world is this decision
[1:10:08] coming from
[1:10:11] but i can tell you one thing the holy
[1:10:12] spirit will bring conviction to your
[1:10:14] heart
[1:10:15] that's one thing i can tell you he
[1:10:16] convicts our lives
[1:10:18] is that right not purloined but showing
[1:10:22] all good fidelity that means a real
[1:10:24] character of one who can be trusted
[1:10:26] that they may adorn
[1:10:30] the doctrine of god our savior in all
[1:10:34] things
[1:10:35] so our conduct our behavior
[1:10:38] where people cannot see in or the place
[1:10:42] where we do in the temple of god
[1:10:45] in the body of jesus christ but the life
[1:10:48] that is
[1:10:49] lived it's an adornment
[1:10:53] what they see that's displayed on the
[1:10:56] outside
[1:10:58] tells what's on the inside
[1:11:02] and this is our desire is that the
[1:11:05] doctrine
[1:11:06] of our savior and lord jesus christ
[1:11:09] would be adorned
[1:11:10] on our life it would be that which
[1:11:14] they would see that because this is more
[1:11:17] you understand it's more than than
[1:11:19] teaching it's more
[1:11:21] this isn't about five steps this is
[1:11:23] where the spirit of god comes down
[1:11:25] and deals with our heart and these
[1:11:27] things are stirred up
[1:11:28] in our lives
[1:11:32] it changes us it causes us on the inside
[1:11:35] to prostrate ourselves and say
[1:11:38] be it unto me there are things that you
[1:11:40] could look at and
[1:11:41] maybe bypass and you wonder and you say
[1:11:44] god why
[1:11:45] why is this being brought to light right
[1:11:46] now but god said
[1:11:48] right now is the time to deal with it
[1:11:51] i'm telling you if he came all at once
[1:11:53] and wanted to mold our character all at
[1:11:54] once
[1:11:55] we'd be in bad shape but he molds us
[1:11:59] shapes us brother bram said with nail
[1:12:01] scarred
[1:12:05] amen can i have just one more moment
[1:12:08] ephesians six verse five i just want to
[1:12:10] wrap this part up
[1:12:12] paul would write of this here and and
[1:12:14] also in colossi in colossians 3
[1:12:16] same thing with servants and masters but
[1:12:18] i want you to notice how he places this
[1:12:20] servants be obedient to them that are
[1:12:23] your masters according to the flesh
[1:12:25] with fear and trembling in singleness of
[1:12:29] your heart
[1:12:30] what's those three words say
[1:12:34] as on to christ
[1:12:39] wow so i'm looking at my boss or i'm
[1:12:41] looking
[1:12:43] but it's with singleness of heart as
[1:12:46] unto
[1:12:48] christ
[1:12:51] not with i service as men pleasers but
[1:12:54] as the servants of christ
[1:12:56] doing the will of god from the heart
[1:13:00] so not just eye pleasers we're just
[1:13:03] trying to do
[1:13:04] just to fit in
[1:13:07] but it's where we do it from our heart
[1:13:09] as paul would say
[1:13:11] what you do do it harder as unto the
[1:13:14] lord
[1:13:16] i'd say it like this you know brother
[1:13:18] drake i'd say when you go to do them
[1:13:20] all that plumbing work that you do
[1:13:23] i would venture to say i i believe i
[1:13:26] could i could say this freely
[1:13:27] the way that you are in those homes that
[1:13:29] you're in and all that that you have to
[1:13:31] do down there
[1:13:32] it's a rough stuff but i say you do it
[1:13:35] and you do it like you do it if it was
[1:13:37] in your house
[1:13:40] to treat it as if it would be your place
[1:13:45] is that right yes you see this is
[1:13:48] something that
[1:13:48] if we notice how paul goes on with good
[1:13:51] will here's how we do it
[1:13:52] with goodwill doing service as to the
[1:13:55] lord and not the men
[1:13:56] i could ask for a show of hands and no
[1:13:59] doubt there's hands that go up and say
[1:14:01] you know what
[1:14:01] i've had to apply that i've had a boss
[1:14:04] or somebody's been mean as a rattlesnake
[1:14:06] they've done this and done that well
[1:14:09] i'll tell you what
[1:14:11] but did you do it as unto the lord
[1:14:15] you see god puts us in peculiar
[1:14:17] situations
[1:14:18] this life is not meant to be a cakewalk
[1:14:23] this life is not meant to be that boy
[1:14:25] i've got to have the right boss and i've
[1:14:26] got to have the ideal boss
[1:14:28] i've got to have this and i've got to
[1:14:29] have that boy
[1:14:32] what a boss that would be right we'd
[1:14:34] have we'd have a
[1:14:35] birthday cake every day
[1:14:38] but you see joseph
[1:14:42] from the scriptures in order
[1:14:45] for what god had in his life to come
[1:14:48] forth
[1:14:49] god had to place him
[1:14:53] in prison god had to place him
[1:14:57] under those who would have rulership
[1:15:00] over his life
[1:15:02] those that would tell him get up in the
[1:15:04] morning
[1:15:05] go to bed this is what you're eating
[1:15:09] why because according to the vision
[1:15:12] the dream he was going to rule
[1:15:15] so there had to be a character that was
[1:15:18] able to
[1:15:18] handle the authority that would be
[1:15:21] entrusted to his life
[1:15:24] sometimes the things that we're so
[1:15:26] interested
[1:15:27] in getting away from that's the flesh
[1:15:29] part of it
[1:15:30] but this part of it here is doing it as
[1:15:33] unto the lord
[1:15:34] god help me to have the right attitude
[1:15:37] tell me to look beyond
[1:15:38] the person or the individual help me to
[1:15:40] look lord
[1:15:43] notice how paul would go on to say this
[1:15:44] knowing that whatsoever good thing any
[1:15:46] man doeth the same shall he receive of
[1:15:48] the lord
[1:15:49] whether he be bond or free
[1:15:52] let me just read the same point i want
[1:15:55] to leave you with this in colossians
[1:15:57] 3 24 if this is a paul speaking of the
[1:15:59] same thing
[1:16:00] what i just read to you knowing
[1:16:04] that of the lord ye shall receive the
[1:16:07] reward
[1:16:08] of the inheritance after
[1:16:13] our journey is completed
[1:16:16] because where we're headed in this hour
[1:16:18] if this ever was even a moment
[1:16:21] where we could say this is the time
[1:16:24] we are to not only receive
[1:16:28] the promise of all the other previous
[1:16:30] ages of the overcomers
[1:16:32] but in this age we are to set with him
[1:16:35] in history even as he is set down
[1:16:39] in his father's throne this is talking
[1:16:42] about
[1:16:43] a reigning and a ruling in the
[1:16:46] millennium are you with me
[1:16:49] it's where that all of where the old
[1:16:51] testament prophets and david would write
[1:16:53] of of that of that time of the rule of
[1:16:56] the son of david
[1:16:57] in the millennium it'll be a time
[1:17:00] her character has been so molded in this
[1:17:03] life
[1:17:04] to where the rapture will be the
[1:17:06] absolute transplanting of that life
[1:17:09] that's been molded
[1:17:10] and shaped through suffering through
[1:17:13] tests
[1:17:13] through trials and when we stand there
[1:17:16] on that day
[1:17:17] just here in that of the rapture well i
[1:17:20] tell you what we'll say lord
[1:17:22] it was worth it all when we sat there to
[1:17:25] marriage suffer the lamb lord thank you
[1:17:27] for grace for the tests and trials
[1:17:29] lord thank you for correction of how to
[1:17:31] look at things in the right way i'll
[1:17:33] tell you you talk about a joyous time
[1:17:34] we'll be
[1:17:35] thankful in that hour is that right
[1:17:40] knowing that of the lord you shall
[1:17:41] receive the reward of the inheritance
[1:17:44] for ye serve the lord
[1:17:48] christ so your boss can say
[1:17:52] my goodness we're going to get you're
[1:17:54] the you're the top guy here
[1:17:57] you in your heart to know i've done it
[1:18:00] because god gave me this job
[1:18:03] i've done it as unto the lord i may have
[1:18:06] had skills but you gave them to me
[1:18:07] abilities you've given to me
[1:18:09] certificates you've given to me lord
[1:18:12] you've helped me you've led my path all
[1:18:13] along you provided for me you are
[1:18:15] jehovah jairo
[1:18:16] and lord jesus it's you lord god that i
[1:18:19] serve
[1:18:20] oh the boss and how that they can think
[1:18:22] my what a model employee what this and
[1:18:24] what that and everything
[1:18:26] else but you're not doing it as unto the
[1:18:28] boss
[1:18:30] you're doing it it's unto the lord
[1:18:33] it's just like when the boss and
[1:18:35] different things you know they can ask
[1:18:36] you and say
[1:18:37] hey why don't you come to the christmas
[1:18:38] party but as unto the lord
[1:18:40] you could say i don't go
[1:18:43] to those kinds of places but samuel did
[1:18:46] you do that
[1:18:47] i did i told them i don't go to those
[1:18:49] kinds of places
[1:18:50] sure it was places where they could eat
[1:18:52] and they would serve drinks but
[1:18:54] i knew that probably most of them was
[1:18:56] going to be sipping some drinks
[1:18:58] and there was already enough stuff to
[1:18:59] come out of their mouth i didn't want to
[1:19:01] be around them
[1:19:02] because there was stuff that i couldn't
[1:19:04] even set no in the
[1:19:06] the lunchroom with them and eat lunch
[1:19:08] with them
[1:19:09] i told my teachers i went my own room
[1:19:12] did my own work
[1:19:13] i for sure didn't want to be involved in
[1:19:14] one of their christmas parties
[1:19:16] and nothing against them all right are
[1:19:19] you with me
[1:19:20] but i can do as what is unto the lord of
[1:19:23] when the job says this
[1:19:25] i can do it at some point you with me
[1:19:30] think of this here i told you i was
[1:19:32] closing i am
[1:19:34] i've held you today i think a little bit
[1:19:35] longer than what i normally would do on
[1:19:37] a thursday night but think of this
[1:19:42] remember when that remember when that
[1:19:44] man that would come by and buy slaves
[1:19:48] he came by that ranch or that plantation
[1:19:54] remember he looked at this one slave he
[1:19:55] wanted to buy him from that broker
[1:19:57] and he asked that broker he said i want
[1:19:59] to buy that one no he's not for sale
[1:20:01] you can't buy him right
[1:20:04] that's a real life that's in the temple
[1:20:07] of god
[1:20:08] you can't buy them for nothing they
[1:20:11] can't be bought
[1:20:12] they've already been bought they've
[1:20:14] already been redeemed and
[1:20:16] placed in him you you can't buy them off
[1:20:19] they're not a cheap reproduction we're
[1:20:21] part of the original amen
[1:20:24] are you with me oh he he he's not for
[1:20:26] sale
[1:20:27] you can't buy him right
[1:20:31] brother brahms said all the rest of them
[1:20:32] what that man noticed is the rest of
[1:20:34] them were so
[1:20:34] weary it was a condition you and i could
[1:20:38] understand that you
[1:20:38] can understand they'd be weary think of
[1:20:41] how aware that they would
[1:20:43] live within their lives like there's
[1:20:45] nothing to live for
[1:20:46] there's no hope they've been separated
[1:20:49] from family
[1:20:50] separated from their native lands no
[1:20:52] doubt there's things that is so
[1:20:54] foreign to them their foods and
[1:20:56] everything else that's around them
[1:21:00] but them said even where they would have
[1:21:01] to whip up to get them to work
[1:21:04] so the weariness
[1:21:07] and then also the whipping them to get
[1:21:09] them to work
[1:21:11] but this man that they seen out here in
[1:21:13] the field
[1:21:14] brother bram says you didn't have to
[1:21:16] whip him
[1:21:18] he was just up and at it at all
[1:21:22] times they said well what you know the
[1:21:26] story but
[1:21:28] what do you do different see it's as
[1:21:30] though that
[1:21:31] there's a difference being made that's
[1:21:33] why he's acting a little bit
[1:21:35] maybe he's a teacher's pet that's why no
[1:21:37] he eats the same food the rest of them
[1:21:39] eat
[1:21:40] he lives in ladies they're where the
[1:21:42] rest of them live
[1:21:44] he works just like the rest of them
[1:21:45] works are you with me
[1:21:48] what is it that makes him act different
[1:21:51] he said i used to wonder that
[1:21:53] he said but i come to find out that
[1:21:56] he knows that his father
[1:22:00] is a king in the homeland and so he
[1:22:03] knows that he's the son
[1:22:05] of a king so because of that it
[1:22:08] makes him con conduct his life it makes
[1:22:11] him
[1:22:12] or direct his life and he said even he
[1:22:15] helps the morals of the others
[1:22:18] you talk about an influence there was an
[1:22:21] influence through his life because he
[1:22:22] knew who he was
[1:22:24] that power of knowing me was it
[1:22:26] influenced others
[1:22:28] around him it caused him it caused him
[1:22:31] to stand out
[1:22:32] when all the rest of them were there but
[1:22:35] this the conduct
[1:22:36] in his life is what brought the
[1:22:38] separation
[1:22:40] he wasn't trying to act odd he wasn't
[1:22:42] trying to be odd
[1:22:44] his conduct is what separated him
[1:22:48] from the rest of the side
[1:22:52] it made him act different that's the
[1:22:54] same thing that the holy ghost does
[1:22:57] to a son and daughter of god that makes
[1:22:59] us act different
[1:23:01] talk to you it brings conviction
[1:23:05] to our lives when we've been wrong
[1:23:08] whether even a thinking or a thought
[1:23:10] comes in their mind
[1:23:11] why would right away the conviction of
[1:23:14] the holy spirit says
[1:23:16] don't do that don't don't don't think
[1:23:18] that way
[1:23:22] why this right here comes back to what
[1:23:26] even brother andrew was preaching on
[1:23:27] friday night
[1:23:29] channels that are free and open
[1:23:34] satan wants to try to clog everything he
[1:23:36] can
[1:23:37] and he'll use any device that he thinks
[1:23:40] he can get
[1:23:43] but i say let's let's live free
[1:23:46] amen be a reflection
[1:23:49] of the real tabernacle of the living god
[1:23:53] let the holy spirit because it'll it'll
[1:23:55] take that right off in our life it'll
[1:23:56] make us act right it'll make us live
[1:23:58] when he has placed
[1:24:00] his life in us and we are placed in the
[1:24:03] temple of the living god
[1:24:05] we reflect his presence
[1:24:08] wherever we go holy
[1:24:12] holy holy unto the lord
[1:24:15] it doesn't matter where we go it's him
[1:24:18] that's on discipline

[1:24:29] this is lord the very desire of each of
[1:24:32] our lives
[1:24:35] he's lord we want to be a real
[1:24:38] reflection
[1:24:40] of you
[1:24:44] i pray heavenly father
[1:24:47] that lord that you would just as you've
[1:24:49] come and spoke to our hearts tonight
[1:24:53] that would be the that would be the
[1:24:55] request of our lives
[1:24:58] we see lord god how that
[1:25:02] just through lord very simple things
[1:25:05] applying that word in our life you're
[1:25:08] god entering into prayer that
[1:25:11] for lord those of the kings and
[1:25:14] so forth that we might live a quiet and
[1:25:18] peaceable life
[1:25:19] not go and talk about it not get a
[1:25:22] church circle together about it
[1:25:24] not get a group of brothers together no
[1:25:27] no through prayer through prayer
[1:25:33] lord i know that lord throughout this
[1:25:37] building
[1:25:39] there might be some lord that's dealing
[1:25:43] dealing with some of these points lord
[1:25:46] as you brought out here tonight
[1:25:50] i pray that god whether they're dealing
[1:25:53] with it tonight
[1:25:55] or it's something lord that's down the
[1:25:57] road but may they just recognize lord
[1:26:01] they're just staying in your presence
[1:26:04] taking things before you in prayer
[1:26:08] really getting there in a place of
[1:26:10] prayer to where
[1:26:12] we're yielded in your presence to where
[1:26:16] that same fire that burns
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:20] what got right there in the bosom of our
[1:26:22] soul
[1:26:23] that same light that should kind of
[1:26:25] light
[1:26:26] that cannot be put out to where lord god
[1:26:32] it just so influences we're so
[1:26:36] submitted and surrendered that lordy
[1:26:38] would influence
[1:26:40] our lives influence
[1:26:44] our behavior influence our thoughts
[1:26:46] influence our action
[1:26:49] lord we're not too big tonight to ask
[1:26:52] for that
[1:26:54] we want to humble ourselves in your
[1:26:55] presence
[1:26:58] for we know lord god of where we're
[1:27:00] headed
[1:27:02] lord through some of the things that you
[1:27:04] would permit to come our way
[1:27:06] it's part of the molding and the shape
[1:27:09] forgive us lord when we've complained
[1:27:12] about things
[1:27:13] we know that that's our flesh but we
[1:27:15] ain't making no excuses for it
[1:27:17] we as a son and daughter of god allowed
[1:27:19] it
[1:27:21] we ask that you'd forgive us help us
[1:27:24] lord i pray sometimes lord what we could
[1:27:28] look
[1:27:28] at it's the very display of christ in
[1:27:31] our life
[1:27:32] in situations that god would bring such
[1:27:36] a testimony
[1:27:38] that others know there's something
[1:27:40] greater
[1:27:41] inside of that life
[1:27:44] something more than just
[1:27:47] self-determination
[1:27:48] or self-will nothing could handle
[1:27:51] that kind of pressure and lord
[1:27:55] we would not be able to unless we
[1:27:57] ourselves were pressurized
[1:28:00] unless lord god we were established
[1:28:03] by your power in the temple of the
[1:28:06] living god
[1:28:06] [Music]
[1:28:08] lord jesus the few days that we tread
[1:28:11] here upon this earth
[1:28:13] i pray that god maybe some lord would
[1:28:16] never give us the time of day
[1:28:18] to witness to him but may
[1:28:22] lord god our lives be a living witness
[1:28:26] may it be that the word of the lord
[1:28:27] would sound out from our lives oh god
[1:28:29] [Music]
[1:28:32] help us lord give us the grace that we
[1:28:34] need
[1:28:35] give us strength lord father if there's
[1:28:38] one here tonight that
[1:28:39] were streaming or would archive this
[1:28:41] service that's not come to that place
[1:28:43] yet lord god
[1:28:45] may they recognize that that's your
[1:28:47] desire for them
[1:28:49] that they would come to that real
[1:28:52] perfect realization to know who they are
[1:28:56] lord god to have lord
[1:28:59] that reality lord that would burn in
[1:29:02] their hearts
[1:29:03] to where lord it's it's no longer them

[1:29:06] [Music]

[1:29:12] that that's your desire that lord
[1:29:16] what they do have a longing for you
