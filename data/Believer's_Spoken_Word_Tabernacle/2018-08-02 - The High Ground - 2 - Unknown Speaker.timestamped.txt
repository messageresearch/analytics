[34:06] through this stocked in Ephesians 6

[34:36] on the whole armour of God that you may
[34:40] be able to stand against the wiles of
[34:43] the devil for we wrestle not against
[34:47] flesh and blood but against
[34:50] principalities against powers against
[34:53] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[34:56] against spiritual wickedness in high
[34:59] places
[35:01] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[35:05] of God that you may be able to withstand
[35:08] in the evil day and having done all to
[35:13] stand let's just ask his blessing on the
[35:17] word tonight amen how many have a need

[38:30] appreciate early yesterday was twenty
[38:34] years twenty years ago and I say that's
[38:43] the best decision I made in my life
[38:45] besides surrendering to the Lord and
[38:49] that's the truth I really mean that with
[38:51] all my heart you know and I just really
[38:54] think God for it yeah I just don't tell
[38:55] her I tell her that all the time and she
[38:58] can tell you that I I look at it I told
[39:00] her I've told her time and time again I
[39:02] said if I knew the love that I have now
[39:05] I said in what I had when we first met I
[39:07] said you know I wouldn't swap that I
[39:09] said I would take what I have right now
[39:12] I said it's grown so much since then you
[39:16] know it's been a truly has been tests
[39:18] and trials and things you come through
[39:20] but God is faithful he is faithful and I
[39:23] just appreciate his His grace and His
[39:25] mercy I so thank God for from my wife
[39:28] she really has been such a such a help
[39:31] and she is such a help to me and within
[39:34] this in the ministry so I think God for
[39:37] her tonight amen
[39:39] I want to just look at this tonight on
[39:41] the high ground and once again looking
[39:45] at at this place in the scripture and
[39:48] we'll just see how the Lord will go I
[39:50] just feel like this just I have so much
[39:53] and I just want to say what he once said
[39:57] when you we take into account what we
[40:02] have just read for a text
[40:04] Paul is admonishing the children of God
[40:08] in that day as it is every day of what
[40:12] is present at that time the evil and he
[40:17] makes it very clear within the scripture
[40:19] that it's it's an evil that is there as
[40:23] he goes through in verse 11 he would
[40:27] call it the wiles which is the subtlety
[40:29] and the trickery of the devil then he
[40:32] goes through and he speaks for we
[40:34] wrestle not against flesh and blood and
[40:37] he goes into that
[40:38] in verse 12 of principalities powers
[40:40] rulers of the darkness of this world and
[40:43] against spiritual wickedness in high
[40:45] places and when he read in Paul makes a
[40:49] statement take unto you the whole armour
[40:51] of God that you may be able to withstand
[40:53] in that evil day it's very very clear
[40:56] that there was standing in this in this
[40:59] day because that evil day it's in this
[41:02] day Paul when he ministered in that day
[41:05] he ministered under the inspiration in
[41:08] that hour and he could say in this evil
[41:10] day when I rainiest ministered in his
[41:14] hour it was God ministering the full
[41:17] armor of God to the children of God
[41:19] because in in every age there's always
[41:22] been a battle there's always been a
[41:24] fight you we see that clear that that
[41:27] battle first of all it began in heaven
[41:30] and that battle began when Lucifer
[41:33] himself rebelled and we know then he he
[41:36] led a third part of the stars away and
[41:39] there was a fall that took place but
[41:42] then that that what had their begin as
[41:45] battles there of angels then it it moved
[41:48] upon human battles when that bat when
[41:51] that Fortress of the word when Eve
[41:54] herself walked out from behind that word
[41:57] then it became human battles and I I
[41:59] want to just say this that when we look
[42:02] at it being human battles it is when we
[42:05] look at ourselves we within our own
[42:09] selves are unfit and unprepared to fight
[42:13] this battle we're no match as a matter
[42:16] of fact you hear brother brown say it
[42:17] over and over again anyone even would be
[42:20] addressing Satan he says now you know
[42:24] you're more than a match as far as from
[42:26] me said but you're not more than a match
[42:28] for him
[42:29] and you see that's it's it's it's who or
[42:33] identified in and who's identified
[42:35] within us and if we can just recognize
[42:38] that then no matter what would come our
[42:41] way it's to recognize who who
[42:44] we are identified with in Jesus Christ
[42:48] and he is over every power there there's
[42:53] not one thing can come your way unless
[42:55] God first permits it and if God permits
[42:59] a test or trial to come your way it's
[43:01] only gonna work for your glory as we
[43:04] will yield to him and in the end God is
[43:07] receiving the victory through our life
[43:09] and as our life as being molded and
[43:11] shaped more and more into his glorious
[43:13] image so without without without the
[43:17] Lord directing us there is no way that
[43:19] we could be able to withstand the very
[43:23] onslaught of the enemy but it takes the
[43:27] very working of the Holy Spirit
[43:30] to actually catch the working of Satan
[43:33] and be able not only to discern his
[43:38] working but be able to call it out and
[43:40] be able to make known what is the true
[43:43] path and when you you think of this
[43:46] thought of the high ground I you know I
[43:48] told you last week that I was standing
[43:51] there on the places in Gettysburg and I
[43:53] i stood around on the places where where
[43:56] it was actually where the union forces
[43:58] had made it in first of all to there in
[44:02] gettysburg and when you look at where
[44:04] what they defended and how that battle
[44:07] was won it wasn't it was mainly because
[44:11] of position they were positioned upon
[44:15] the high places the high ground and and
[44:19] when you look down through time you know
[44:22] you you see that many battles that have
[44:25] been worn and every army seeks to get
[44:28] the high ground when they're studying on
[44:31] a map they seek to get that high ground
[44:33] and maintain that high ground because
[44:36] that high ground is a place of advantage
[44:40] it allows you not only the advantage of
[44:44] being able to come at the enemy or or to
[44:48] maybe to shoot down at the enemy or to
[44:50] look but his advances but it it's a
[44:53] you're able at that place to be able
[44:55] look and see where the enemy is moving
[44:58] in his tactics and be able to to move so
[45:03] that you're in position to be able to
[45:05] defend that and there's no higher ground
[45:08] than the Lord Jesus Christ David said it
[45:12] like this he said he's my strong tower
[45:15] David called him my rock and my fortress
[45:18] and my shield as a matter of fact
[45:21] without him he is the he is the watchman
[45:25] of the Church of the Living God the Holy
[45:27] Spirit is and he has men but remember
[45:30] mass man and himself can never be able
[45:33] to catch things it would have to be the
[45:36] Holy Spirit revealed by a gift that he's
[45:40] placed there and it's God that brings
[45:42] the church on alert it makes us watchful
[45:46] in our lives and our hearts and through
[45:49] that it's not just a watchfulness but he
[45:51] also is giving to us the direction of
[45:55] which were to go within this hour we
[45:58] need the continual discernment and
[46:01] leadership of the Holy Spirit this is
[46:05] what when this is this is I'll say it
[46:07] like this this is the benefit of the
[46:10] children of God that we are led by the
[46:13] Spirit of God it's a privilege for the
[46:15] word of God to come down and to discern
[46:18] our lives in our hearts because we we
[46:21] cannot have confidence within the flesh
[46:24] we've got to recognize that what we're
[46:27] all around us of what of what things
[46:29] that even that we cannot see but there's
[46:31] spiritual forces that Paul is talking
[46:34] about that is at work and we need the
[46:37] discernment of the Holy Ghost so when we
[46:41] think of this I want to just draw your
[46:44] attention to the place where we are
[46:47] looking at last week on the program of
[46:49] God and when you think of that term of
[46:52] the program of God to know that God has
[46:55] has had a program and he still has a
[46:59] program God has never changed his
[47:03] program
[47:04] but it's just like when you know the
[47:07] program you're given a program when you
[47:09] would go into a play where you're going
[47:11] into maybe a school musical and there or
[47:17] where they're going to maybe have the
[47:18] choir that's gonna sing or orchestra
[47:20] there's a program that is laid out that
[47:24] that you would know I know many times
[47:26] when we would as the teachers we would
[47:28] have to hear all of the squeaks and
[47:30] squawks and everything else we were
[47:32] actually called the dress rehearsal
[47:34] audience and we would have to bring our
[47:36] our kids down there and and set for
[47:38] whatever the duration of whatever the
[47:40] entire concert was and to try to get
[47:42] that out and you know it was squeaks
[47:43] quacks and crowd control and and you
[47:45] know what helped is that when they gave
[47:47] you a little brochure and for me out
[47:50] there just constantly looking at it you
[47:51] know because we had to know when to take
[47:53] our kids out because it's walking them
[47:56] in the right door and I have to have a
[47:57] program that I could look at to know
[47:59] okay
[48:00] this this cord okay they're singing
[48:02] jingle bells and okay yelling okay here
[48:04] we are that's this class and now we're
[48:05] gonna be I got to get my kids over there
[48:07] get them lined up if I didn't have a
[48:09] program it would make it awful hard but
[48:14] because I've got a program then the
[48:16] program I'm alerted to what's going on
[48:19] and then I can begin to look at and I
[48:21] know okay wait a minute but the second
[48:23] graders have gone then the first graders
[48:25] are going to go then they want me coming
[48:27] next so I'm able to know when to get my
[48:30] kids up so I don't get them up too early
[48:33] neither do I get them up too late it's
[48:36] what we call that you know a dress
[48:38] rehearsal and I I believe with all of my
[48:40] heart that when we look at it now God's
[48:43] program is unfolding and yet we are also
[48:46] in the midst of a dress rehearsal and
[48:49] what I mean by that is is that there
[48:51] might be some notes that you squeak the
[48:53] wrong way but remember this is a dress
[48:56] rehearsal he who wrote the program he
[49:00] that's in charge of it is here to guide
[49:02] and direct us and make sure that we're
[49:05] right on the mark that we're coming in
[49:07] at the right time and we're ready to do
[49:10] whatever part it is that he has for us
[49:12] to do so the program of God it's
[49:15] something that is it's a continual
[49:17] unfolding and I want you to watch how
[49:19] that you know that that brother branham
[49:21] he places this here and the message the
[49:23] contest and he's praying here as he
[49:26] enters into this message now think of
[49:29] this the contest Heavenly Father's we
[49:31] stand here as many thoughts is dying out
[49:34] in our hearts and of the mistakes of
[49:36] last year and as we're approaching the
[49:39] death of sixty two and the birth of 63
[49:41] oh God may we be one step higher up the
[49:45] ladder until we can see Jesus and his
[49:48] program may everyone here Lord in prayer
[49:52] while the old year is dying
[49:54] and the new birth of the new year is
[49:56] coming in may the old man sin and
[49:59] unbelief die out in our heart and the
[50:01] new birth come in with and with the 1963
[50:04] like a rushing mighty wind that might
[50:07] fill our beings and make us new
[50:10] creatures in Christ what something goes
[50:13] on make us fit servants forgive our past
[50:21] bless our future guide us Oh Lord God
[50:26] with a mighty hand Jehovah blessed these
[50:30] ministers here bless all the way through
[50:32] the visitors be thou with us Lord
[50:34] we are your servants and we give
[50:37] ourselves wholly to you for 1963 that
[50:40] the power of your spirit might have more
[50:43] preeminence 'as in our life and in our
[50:46] being I believe that's a prayer that
[50:50] your spirit might have more preeminence
[50:53] is in our life and in our being help us
[50:55] God forgive us and help us we pray raise
[50:59] up mighty men raise up mighty warriors
[51:04] of the faith notice the prayer I want
[51:07] you to catch this the prayer that is
[51:10] being made to God forgiving of the past
[51:14] forgiving our mistakes but yet here
[51:17] within that may we move up higher up the
[51:20] ladder to see Jesus and his program here
[51:24] you see it's a continual focusing in and
[51:27] whole
[51:28] the closer we get to the very moment and
[51:33] climax of the rapture the change of the
[51:36] body the Church of the Living God is is
[51:39] becoming more and more focused and with
[51:42] that it is also Satan's desire to try to
[51:47] bring more and more distractions there's
[51:54] challenges against his coming
[51:56] there's distractions as David described
[52:00] it in Psalms 27 he never described it as
[52:04] just facing one front but he said all
[52:07] around me it's surrounded on every side
[52:12] you got that you have you're surrounded
[52:15] you yeah you covered all around by those
[52:17] that are deniers and and everything
[52:20] everything that is surrounding but but
[52:22] here is the precious precious reality he
[52:27] have set me upon a rock
[52:31] and now my head shall be lifted up above
[52:36] mine enemies he didn't say he would take
[52:38] the enemies away but the preciousness of
[52:40] it is he has sent me on a rock and that
[52:43] rock had lifted my head above my enemy
[52:47] so it's in a high ground a place of
[52:49] advantage in Christ
[52:56] and he's asking God because only God can
[52:59] do this race up mighty men what someone
[53:02] makes a mighty man
[53:05] God with you when God told Gideon a
[53:10] mighty man about what makes a mighty man
[53:12] of Valor God you and God are the
[53:17] majority raise up mighty warriors of the
[53:22] faith open this year Lord that hidden
[53:25] manna that rock beneath the rock that we
[53:28] might see the program of God and this is
[53:31] what I want you to I want you to see in
[53:33] the catch here notice this prayer
[53:35] friends this is a prayer that's that's
[53:38] interceding and asking God to open what
[53:42] God has promised to open in this hour
[53:46] you see that's part of understanding
[53:49] that we're not just praying but our
[53:52] prayers are in line with the
[53:55] understanding that's to be in this hour
[53:58] so in God is is ministering through his
[54:01] word there can be a lot of things that
[54:03] you can look at and say I don't fully
[54:05] understand this I don't fully understand
[54:08] that but yet when the Spirit of God is
[54:10] moving upon your heart these are the
[54:12] things to pray about and that's why it's
[54:15] important to pray for Revelation I
[54:17] believe if you pray for revelation I'm a
[54:19] witness of it God will see to it what it
[54:22] is that you have Nita and it's not just
[54:27] listen revelation it's not an
[54:29] accumulation of facts it's a continual
[54:32] unfolding and a peeling back of the
[54:35] layers of the very Christ of God the
[54:39] Lord Jesus Christ it's continuing to
[54:42] reveal him it's not just in the kids not
[54:46] an accumulation of facts its revealing
[54:49] the Lord Jesus Christ and the truly the
[54:52] more that he reveals himself the more
[54:55] simpler if it's that's a word the more
[54:58] simple that it becomes and you look at
[55:01] it and you're seeing the Lord Jesus
[55:03] Christ and you're seeing your South and
[55:05] it just narrows it down not into some
[55:08] great big mystical not able to be
[55:11] understood and
[55:12] Oh algebra trigonometry prop no it
[55:16] narrows it down into the simplicity that
[55:19] God intended for it and let me tell you
[55:22] the simplicity was not that we would be
[55:25] able to put it all together and memorize
[55:28] it here but the simplicity is to yield
[55:31] to his holy spirit and allow him to
[55:35] interpret that word in us and through us
[55:38] that is God in simplicity then we might
[55:44] see the program of God cap off the
[55:47] pyramids of our life Lord put the
[55:49] capstone Christ Jesus upon each and
[55:52] every one of us may his great
[55:54] magnificent holy blessings be upon us
[55:56] may the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon
[55:59] us may the power of the resurrection be
[56:01] manifested God how we thank you tonight
[56:04] we are yours we give ourselves fully to
[56:08] you Lord that's your desire tonight Lord
[56:10] but I want to give myself more fully to
[56:14] you you know the Scriptures it says it
[56:19] like this in the book of first
[56:23] Corinthians chapter 14 verse 8 it says
[56:26] it like this for if the trumpet give an
[56:29] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[56:32] himself for the to the battle is that
[56:37] right so when we look at this a familiar
[56:41] scripture to us but if the trumpet it
[56:46] can have a sound but if it's uncertain
[56:49] then no one knows what to do but it must
[56:53] if it gives a certain sound then one
[56:57] knows how to prepare himself for the
[56:59] battle so then when we're looking at
[57:02] this the Prophet picks this up in the
[57:05] message uncertain sounding I'm just
[57:06] going to refer to parts within here
[57:08] brother bran was talking about how that
[57:11] you find people asking the question what
[57:15] is this stuff that they're talking about
[57:17] the Holy Ghost reading minds in this day
[57:20] and seeing God working like that now
[57:23] listen people are wondering about that
[57:25] could people wonder about that how could
[57:29] that even be a question you see it shows
[57:32] the subtleness and the working of satan
[57:36] to move people away from the true Living
[57:40] God so then it becomes a question who is
[57:44] this what is this it becomes a question
[57:48] but yet there is a certainty to it that
[57:52] what God has said in his word it is
[57:55] certain that the Holy Spirit is a
[57:58] revealer and an interpreter of the very
[58:01] secrets and intents of the heart
[58:04] you know I know you can set right here
[58:07] and set right here at services here
[58:10] and you know sometimes you're gonna have
[58:11] people the first time you know they come
[58:13] in you know it's like oh my goodness
[58:15] well you've you've been telling him all
[58:17] about me it's not the man that knows
[58:20] about you it's God that knows your knee
[58:24] and why would God do that he is letting
[58:27] you personally know that he is still the
[58:32] same maybe maybe for your life it's just
[58:34] responding it and responding to a call
[58:37] from God and God's letting you know
[58:39] there is a place that you can come to
[58:41] this is a living God he lets you know it
[58:44] ain't a church it's me you see that's
[58:48] the fact that's the thing that is that
[58:50] has been missed
[58:52] within the ages and what has been where
[58:55] the Spirit of God will always come back
[58:58] and he's calling the people back to the
[59:01] relationship of the Holy Spirit because
[59:03] people would drift from that how does
[59:06] that relationship come it comes by the
[59:11] word being delivered by the Holy Ghost
[59:20] why all these big churches brother Rams
[59:22] asking this question wow these big
[59:24] churches
[59:25] because Christ said it would be that way
[59:27] I tell you right now there's some big
[59:30] churches I've drove by and I know he's
[59:34] not just talking about buildings we're
[59:36] talking about numbers we're talking
[59:38] about organizations that are massive but
[59:45] you know I want you to think of this you
[59:47] know the Bible says in the book in the
[59:49] Book of Kings that they have built a
[59:51] temple that could hold all of Israel
[59:54] you're talking about a mega church it
[59:58] had to be titled grace something I don't
[59:59] know what it was but you understand what
[1:00:03] I'm saying
[1:00:04] a temple that could hold the impact that
[1:00:08] that was a huge but what I'm sure I'm
[1:00:09] getting to is that people at least these
[1:00:12] questions how could this be it and where
[1:00:14] is this at but you see it is certainty
[1:00:17] that it's promised within the word when
[1:00:19] it speaks that denominations would arise
[1:00:22] they'll form themselves in the Book of
[1:00:24] Revelations I don't have time to read
[1:00:26] all of it but in the Book of Revelations
[1:00:28] chapter 13 it speaks of the forming of
[1:00:32] an image unto the Beast and it speaks of
[1:00:36] a Confederate of churches and yet where
[1:00:40] people can look and say how can this be
[1:00:42] how is this happening where would this
[1:00:44] be but listen everything itself that is
[1:00:48] happening you can see it identified in
[1:00:51] God's Word it's just like when they pass
[1:00:55] the different legislation and the laws
[1:00:58] you know the Bible said in the Book of
[1:00:59] Daniel that this man that Antichrist
[1:01:02] it speaks of that man it says they will
[1:01:04] close laws to be passed
[1:01:08] you see there's reason is it's something
[1:01:11] that we understand that the everything
[1:01:13] within this world there are two
[1:01:15] spiritual powers at work
[1:01:21] that manic image to the Beast the
[1:01:23] prophet called it the Roman Catholic
[1:01:25] hierarchy and the deals with this says
[1:01:27] there's a true sound to it he goes into
[1:01:29] that of the UN where people are having
[1:01:31] such faith within the UN will have the
[1:01:34] League of Nations and will and will
[1:01:36] really talk and get all this look at it
[1:01:40] where's it at consolidating together but
[1:01:46] yet there is nothing that can be solved
[1:01:50] within it one more after a war is passed
[1:01:52] then here comes another war we see it
[1:01:55] going on and on and when the breath
[1:01:56] brings it down to it like this and I
[1:01:58] want to read this part with you
[1:01:59] right out of that message he said
[1:02:02] there's only one certain sound that's
[1:02:04] the gospel prepare for the battle what
[1:02:08] battle the coming of the Lord this is
[1:02:14] what Satan has been battling against all
[1:02:19] the way down through time he has come
[1:02:23] against the coming of the Lord because
[1:02:26] remember the coming of the Lord his
[1:02:29] physical return is a climax of where he
[1:02:33] has come by way of his spirit revealing
[1:02:37] his word and moving and collecting his
[1:02:40] children his bride down through the ages
[1:02:43] after he himself the body is taken up to
[1:02:46] the throne the Holy Ghost came back on
[1:02:49] the day of Pentecost the life that was
[1:02:52] in our sacrifice the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:56] God Himself coming now
[1:02:58] to enter into the worshiper here is God
[1:03:01] coming and he's collecting his thoughts
[1:03:04] and what takes place when he has
[1:03:07] collected and here he is building his
[1:03:10] body his bride as it was when Adams side
[1:03:14] was open so in Christ side was open at
[1:03:18] Calvary out of him was taking the water
[1:03:21] and the blood and here the spirit all of
[1:03:25] that going together to bring about his
[1:03:28] church back to himself so then when he
[1:03:31] Church is coming to that completion of
[1:03:35] what he had in his mind then he himself
[1:03:37] is prescient to fully step in not just a
[1:03:41] part but the fullness of himself coming
[1:03:45] once again but not in groom form but in
[1:03:49] bride form
[1:03:53] don't want to lose you maybe New Orleans
[1:03:56] with that but if see it's God Himself is
[1:04:00] collecting those thoughts that were
[1:04:02] already in his mind brother Brent says
[1:04:05] prepare yourself for battle now against
[1:04:07] evil when evil is be setting the people
[1:04:11] on every hand everything going wrong
[1:04:13] home life going wrong
[1:04:16] the UN falling and the nation's breaking
[1:04:19] and the atomic bombs around and homes
[1:04:22] splitting up motherhood going low and in
[1:04:24] morals among the people distrust amongst
[1:04:27] one another and all the denominations
[1:04:30] fussing and stewing what you want to do
[1:04:33] be certain prepare yourself for the
[1:04:37] battle and you say it like this you see
[1:04:44] where the onslaught of where brother
[1:04:49] Brown will go into this of how that you
[1:04:53] see the condition and he was identifying
[1:04:57] it then we're by way of television these
[1:05:00] other things he says you find it's
[1:05:03] constantly on the increase the Tabasco
[1:05:05] the whiskey and all these other things
[1:05:07] immoral dress twinam dirty jokes
[1:05:09] jokesters on the television programs and
[1:05:11] America is falling for it this is words
[1:05:14] and in parallels that no what's this
[1:05:17] this isn't just statements it must there
[1:05:19] must be a parallel this is a book of
[1:05:22] prophecy so it's parallel to that time
[1:05:26] where King Nebuchadnezzar it's actually
[1:05:29] Belteshazzar where the vessels were
[1:05:33] taken when Israel rebelled in those
[1:05:36] vessels out of the temple were taken and
[1:05:39] they were taken into Babylon remember
[1:05:42] when it was time here all these things
[1:05:45] are working up it's time for Israel to
[1:05:49] come back into her homeland it's time
[1:05:52] for them to come up but seventy years
[1:05:55] are right there at the door to be up of
[1:05:57] what was prophesied and notice how that
[1:06:00] in that time you see how that belt - as
[1:06:03] our heroes up and they begin to take the
[1:06:07] vessels of God and such uncleanness and
[1:06:10] such ungodliness and here it was at that
[1:06:13] moment where God there had been an
[1:06:16] accumulating if we could say it a cup of
[1:06:18] iniquity had been accumulating to where
[1:06:22] God Himself was tired of it it it had
[1:06:25] reached its end and at that time there
[1:06:29] was a kingdom that was already ready to
[1:06:33] take over the Meads and pressure and
[1:06:35] that was already laid out in the vision
[1:06:38] of Daniel the dream of Nebuchadnezzar of
[1:06:41] which listen to me of which none of the
[1:06:45] wise men in Babylon astrologers and all
[1:06:49] of those men they could not tell and
[1:06:52] decipher the meaning of the dream that
[1:06:56] was given to Nebuchadnezzar where you
[1:06:59] list me they couldn't do it and never
[1:07:03] can answer told him you know they come
[1:07:05] before him and you know there's a haste
[1:07:07] and never connects is going to slay them
[1:07:09] off I want you to catch this he was
[1:07:11] going to wipe them all out he was gonna
[1:07:14] slay every wise man that would have not
[1:07:16] only been those men of Babylon but it
[1:07:19] would have also been those Hebrew
[1:07:21] children that were a part of the wise
[1:07:23] men as well but Daniel raised up in that
[1:07:25] moment and David Daniel said why is the
[1:07:28] king in such haste I ask you who was it
[1:07:33] that brought courage and Daniel to rise
[1:07:36] up the same girl who met Martin Luther
[1:07:41] at that altar that day the same God that
[1:07:45] has got ahold of your heart and of your
[1:07:47] life
[1:07:49] Daniel rose up and he said why is he
[1:07:51] being hates let us will we will go pray
[1:07:54] give us so many days and Daniel went and
[1:07:57] prayed he went and prayed and God
[1:08:00] revealed to him and when God revealed to
[1:08:03] him I want you to catch this I don't
[1:08:05] have time to read it you can read it in
[1:08:06] your Bible when you get home in the Book
[1:08:09] of Daniel but I want you to catch this
[1:08:10] when God revealed to Daniel that dream
[1:08:14] Daniels begin to worship hello that that
[1:08:22] which was hidden that which was obscure
[1:08:25] from all the other men it wasn't that
[1:08:28] Daniel himself had that understanding
[1:08:30] but Daniel made it clear in his worship
[1:08:33] and he made it clear before the presence
[1:08:36] of the king that it is not I who have
[1:08:39] done this but it is the Almighty God
[1:08:41] that has revealed himself and his plan
[1:08:45] to his servant Messiah to you like this
[1:08:48] that unfolding it didn't mean a whole
[1:08:51] lot it didn't have the meaning to
[1:08:53] Nebuchadnezzar like it does for you and
[1:08:55] me that meant making known there in that
[1:08:58] time it didn't have the meaning do a lot
[1:09:01] of down through time let me tell you
[1:09:03] something too many they can look at this
[1:09:05] and they can look back on certain things
[1:09:07] and now the scholars and different ones
[1:09:09] can look back up on this thing and
[1:09:11] there's certain things that they can go
[1:09:13] into and then bring you know look at
[1:09:15] certain facts and breaking those
[1:09:17] kingdoms but you see friends it's not an
[1:09:19] accumulation of facts the Bible itself
[1:09:22] is one glorious picture of redemption
[1:09:25] it is a tying together from Genesis to
[1:09:29] Revelation of the very program of
[1:09:32] Almighty God it's just another part
[1:09:35] it's another act that came on and every
[1:09:39] one of the acts are all leading up to
[1:09:41] the climatic act within the unfolding of
[1:09:45] God's great program
[1:09:48] here's Daniel Daniel's praying he's
[1:09:52] looking to God upon these things and you
[1:09:55] find how that here was the media sin
[1:09:57] purse
[1:09:58] they already those walls you couldn't
[1:10:00] Pam punctuate you could not penetrate
[1:10:01] them walls
[1:10:02] of Babylon but God look at this
[1:10:06] God gave wisdom to the Medes in purse so
[1:10:10] divert the river to divert the river you
[1:10:15] see there was no doubt days that went on
[1:10:18] months that went on when all this plan
[1:10:20] was being developed and they didn't know
[1:10:24] it inside of Babylon let me tell you
[1:10:26] something
[1:10:26] Babylon when we look at it in the
[1:10:29] scriptures do you know how it is they've
[1:10:31] tried to say where was Babylon at they
[1:10:33] tried to find all these places well it's
[1:10:36] in Iraq and they try to go through and
[1:10:38] excavate this but let me tell you
[1:10:39] something you could find a little place
[1:10:42] of Babylon but you wouldn't find Satan
[1:10:45] there because he's already moved from
[1:10:47] that seat he's already moved from there
[1:10:51] Babylon itself it's not a physical
[1:10:53] Babylon anymore that was only your tithe
[1:10:56] her characteristic the book of
[1:10:58] Revelation lets us know that Babylon
[1:11:01] itself is a very spiritual working it is
[1:11:06] that of a of a confederation of a spirit
[1:11:10] Satan himself moving through religion
[1:11:17] because remember the whole thrust and
[1:11:19] theme of Babylon Nimrods inspiration was
[1:11:23] after the flood will build these walls
[1:11:26] and they'll be tribute that's paid from
[1:11:29] Nineveh and rad all of those places can
[1:11:32] tribute can be played and if you come
[1:11:35] inside of these walls of Babylon
[1:11:37] you can live however you want to live
[1:11:40] let me tell you something when you come
[1:11:43] inside the walls of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:46] Christ then you can really live how you
[1:11:50] ought to live and you not only live how
[1:11:53] you ought to live you live how you want
[1:11:56] to live because your life
[1:11:59] has been change by the power of God
[1:12:02] breaking forth upon prophecy hallelujah
[1:12:08] it's a certainty in celebrity its mother
[1:12:11] I have to do this right I can't do that
[1:12:14] it's a love affair I do only those
[1:12:17] things that please him I'll tell you it
[1:12:24] might be a mystery to your soul or not
[1:12:26] but if you just open up and you'll just
[1:12:28] catch down that devil that devil that
[1:12:30] would be telling you it's not for you
[1:12:31] you can't receive it if you'll just call
[1:12:34] him a liar cause he is a liar if you
[1:12:38] just call him a liar and you just stand
[1:12:40] upon God's Word and say Lord open my
[1:12:43] understanding on how to receive you I'm
[1:12:46] quoting a direct quote I don't want
[1:12:48] mists of unity I believe it's where I
[1:12:50] believe it's something worth quoting God
[1:12:52] you opened my understanding on how to
[1:12:54] receive you what I might be talking to
[1:12:56] you I don't want it to be left in
[1:12:57] riddles I'm out telling you tonight
[1:12:59] there is a way that's the very same God
[1:13:01] that revealed to Daniel that dream is
[1:13:04] the same God that can bring things that
[1:13:07] are hard sentences that seem like hard
[1:13:09] things he can reveal it in his power of
[1:13:13] simplicity this is the high ground we
[1:13:18] have you may not see that but God has
[1:13:21] placed me I can see that there's other
[1:13:23] believers on that high ground that can
[1:13:25] point to the same thing it said he's
[1:13:27] still the same God glory be to God and
[1:13:35] one one man nobody could interpret it
[1:13:36] but you see what happened listen the
[1:13:38] interpretation God had a man that was
[1:13:41] there that could receive from God and
[1:13:44] that receiving of God the mercy of God
[1:13:47] stepped in and here's his yielding to
[1:13:52] God and standing on God's Word
[1:13:55] it gave mercy to that whole kingdom let
[1:14:00] me tell you something right now you want
[1:14:02] to know why that that that everything
[1:14:04] itself could still be standing the
[1:14:07] scriptures are true in the book of
[1:14:08] Thessalonians that he
[1:14:10] let it he let it he let it until he be
[1:14:13] taken out of the way its Christ in you
[1:14:16] its him fulfilling his program in your
[1:14:19] life he's not a moment late he's not a
[1:14:21] moment early he's right on time you
[1:14:24] might look at your times of your trip
[1:14:26] things and your failings but you got to
[1:14:27] remember God himself knew had knowledge
[1:14:30] about all of that and that's why he's
[1:14:32] provided in how that he himself would
[1:14:35] move and work and direct our life so
[1:14:38] that when it all comes down you are
[1:14:40] asked him look at it again and again and
[1:14:42] our faith is rising realizing that I'm
[1:14:45] not standing here by my own power but
[1:14:48] I'm standing here in the power of his
[1:14:51] mind
[1:14:52] it's his prevailing power working in my
[1:14:56] life
[1:15:01] ferma just say it like this
[1:15:03] his prevailing power working in our life
[1:15:06] is just like that of noah the bible said
[1:15:10] noah was warned of god he was warned of
[1:15:13] God why was he warned of God because he
[1:15:16] was of God and Noah preached the warning
[1:15:20] to that whole generation but why didn't
[1:15:22] that whole generation say receive it
[1:15:24] because they weren't of God but nor was
[1:15:27] of God I hope you see this God would
[1:15:29] regard came down and God don't look at
[1:15:32] things like you I look at it let me just
[1:15:36] preach a little simplicity now you might
[1:15:38] step over one penny in the parking lot
[1:15:41] but you pick up a quarter God will walk
[1:15:45] over pennies he picks up pennies and
[1:15:47] quarters close it all makes change come
[1:15:54] on somebody god don't look at things
[1:15:56] like you and I look at and we think
[1:15:58] three cents can you buy tootsie roll
[1:15:59] that nowadays gotta have my five cents
[1:16:01] or ten cents and how used to be back in
[1:16:03] the days you can get it with Chitti roll
[1:16:04] for one cent three for three cent and
[1:16:06] three cents you're about halfway there
[1:16:07] now leaders lemonheads Boston baked
[1:16:12] beans but we're getting to a head our
[1:16:14] lips are going to come out boy and just
[1:16:15] swaggin in a minute but you see God
[1:16:18] don't look at things that way he don't
[1:16:21] look at things as insignificant
[1:16:23] and he makes you and I aware of it but
[1:16:26] within our life there are not little
[1:16:28] insignificant things but it is God who
[1:16:32] is ordering all things Alleluia
[1:16:38] the Bible said faith is the substance of
[1:16:41] things hoped for and the evidence of
[1:16:43] things not seen
[1:16:46] Alleluia so within this know up being
[1:16:50] warned of God notice he was warned of
[1:16:52] God Noah
[1:16:54] destruction is coming you know brother
[1:16:57] BAM tells it like this
[1:17:00] Lord Ram tells us that Noah he said he
[1:17:04] was a man that had his family together
[1:17:05] and he prayed together with his family
[1:17:07] he said a matter of fact he said no he
[1:17:09] said God he said Noah was out in the
[1:17:11] field one day praying and the Lord spoke
[1:17:13] to enough now you might look at that you
[1:17:15] might say well that ain't even wrote in
[1:17:16] the Bible but here's what I want to tell
[1:17:18] you God will speak to those who are
[1:17:21] seeking after him God just didn't
[1:17:24] dropped something down here upon Abraham
[1:17:27] Abraham himself remember there's
[1:17:30] relation going back to Noah and Abraham
[1:17:32] himself he receives a witness he
[1:17:36] receives direction where that stands out
[1:17:38] in his mind how many the rest of people
[1:17:40] that lived in his time the rest
[1:17:42] Abraham's relatives - what happened to
[1:17:44] Noah it didn't mean nothing it was just
[1:17:46] an event it was something that happen
[1:17:48] maybe if they had been alive and the ark
[1:17:51] they could have still had it there they
[1:17:52] would have sold tickets to it but it was
[1:17:54] something different with Abraham the
[1:17:57] Prophet tells us Abraham
[1:17:59] thought about it and he said God what
[1:18:01] you did in Noah and as real as you were
[1:18:04] to know the Lord will you make yourself
[1:18:06] known to me that way and he said when he
[1:18:08] prayed that prayer he said God came down
[1:18:11] and met him that day in that field and
[1:18:14] he called him you see there is a point
[1:18:16] of reference here so you look at this
[1:18:20] how that Noah being warned of God and to
[1:18:23] think of how that that word what's this
[1:18:26] what's this warning of God it was not
[1:18:28] something to where Noah could preach in
[1:18:31] a manner as though you just come on in
[1:18:35] but remember the word was it started out
[1:18:38] there was a rebuke men in that day the
[1:18:44] way they were living in that day men and
[1:18:47] women the way that they were living
[1:18:48] remembered what God said in the book of
[1:18:50] Genesis chapter 6 that it that it
[1:18:52] actually repented the Lord that he had
[1:18:55] made man because the imagination of his
[1:18:58] heart was continually upon evil and the
[1:19:06] Bible goes on to talk about how that the
[1:19:09] earth at that time that violence was
[1:19:10] filled through them you know they became
[1:19:12] channels for violence to come but no it
[1:19:17] was a channel for righteousness to come
[1:19:19] so you're going to be a channel for
[1:19:21] something a conduit for something why
[1:19:25] not be a conduit for the Lord why not be
[1:19:28] a channel for his righteousness and his
[1:19:30] life to flow through now no doubt there
[1:19:33] were many now listen to me now in the
[1:19:35] days of Noah don't think there was only
[1:19:36] one boat there were many boats but there
[1:19:39] was one who was God constructed come on
[1:19:43] somebody you see know about what's this
[1:19:45] intact playing out Noah's boat had three
[1:19:48] floors to it it had a justification a
[1:19:51] calling you with me it had creeping
[1:19:55] things in the bottom for us where that
[1:19:59] little serpent that made you do it in
[1:20:01] the first place can still be there even
[1:20:02] at the calling forth and you repent and
[1:20:05] say Lord receive me as a sinner the
[1:20:07] thing that made you do the things you
[1:20:09] did and still be there but then you come
[1:20:11] up to the second floor and when you come
[1:20:14] up to the second floor there's
[1:20:16] sanctification is that right and in that
[1:20:19] floor saying duplication is a cleansing
[1:20:22] is that right you have all of the the
[1:20:25] animals and those things move around but
[1:20:27] then you come on up to the top floor and
[1:20:29] on the top floor is the ceiling away and
[1:20:33] in the ceiling away there's also a
[1:20:36] window for the light in the evening time
[1:20:39] to come through
[1:20:41] but window is also there because through
[1:20:45] that window Noah will receive his seven
[1:20:49] sealed visitation he'll catch that
[1:20:52] rainbow coming are you with me it's a
[1:20:55] covenant he'll catch that bow are you
[1:20:57] with me tonight what island what I'm
[1:20:59] just following his leading is to show
[1:21:01] you these things belonging to the
[1:21:04] children of God on the high ground

[1:21:25] mountain that place it grower that stole
[1:21:31] that stole that strong that was huge out

[1:22:10] receiving light I want you to catch this
[1:22:13] do you realize that out of that same
[1:22:16] window listen to me now out of that same
[1:22:19] window is where the Prophet tells us
[1:22:22] that Satan got up in that same window
[1:22:24] and he spoke down to Noah he say
[1:22:29] aren't you come on out I don't think you
[1:22:33] want to stay in here and look you said

[1:23:44] had in the message look the Prophet said
[1:23:47] Abraham there were a lot of
[1:23:49] misunderstandings he said but Abraham
[1:23:52] didn't focus focus on the
[1:23:55] misunderstandings of the promise he
[1:23:58] focused on the one who made the promise
[1:24:02] [Music]

[1:24:08] revealed then we wait upon his promise

[1:27:07] like that he only is my rock and my
[1:27:14] salvation he I'm not trusting in
[1:27:19] anything else not even yourself I'm
[1:27:22] trusting in him
[1:27:25] you see trusting in him I trust in the
[1:27:29] new birth the experience that he had
[1:27:31] brought to my life it brings him to a
[1:27:34] reality in me I'm trusting only that's a
[1:27:39] that's a huge word and only in him the
[1:27:43] job says like this you're going to an
[1:27:44] operating room there's a gondor's of
[1:27:46] somebody coming in there you got a
[1:27:47] surgeon
[1:27:48] you've got your nurses you've got those
[1:27:50] that are handing the instruments and
[1:27:51] things like that but the person that
[1:27:53] goes in there for the operation is not
[1:27:56] relying on a nurse or an assistant to be
[1:28:00] doing the operation they're resting on
[1:28:03] the surgeon who comes and talks to him
[1:28:07] and lets him know what he's going to do
[1:28:09] there might be a lot of other people in
[1:28:12] your life but he only but sending my
[1:28:18] husband no he only buttressing on my
[1:28:22] wife but he only if you have heat only
[1:28:26] in your life and he has he only in his
[1:28:28] life then it will be he only bringing
[1:28:32] the union to how it ought to be and then
[1:28:36] your expectation is on him when
[1:28:39] disappointments come when everything
[1:28:41] else comes he only is my rock I'll tell
[1:28:49] about the high ground I'll talk about
[1:28:52] the high ground
[1:28:55] no go on the low ground stay on the high
[1:28:58] ground you say how do I stay on the high
[1:29:01] ground you stay there in Christ and the
[1:29:04] Prophet tells us that last part of
[1:29:06] Ephesians 6 praying always with all
[1:29:10] supplications prayer is the radarscreen
[1:29:18] there might been a lot of things that
[1:29:20] can go undetected like when Israel flew
[1:29:24] into Iran and destroyed that reactor
[1:29:26] they flew only so far off the ground in
[1:29:29] that helicopter they went undetected
[1:29:33] they knew where the lines were at they
[1:29:36] could fly in there let me tell you
[1:29:38] something it doesn't matter what
[1:29:39] direction that the enemy comes from it
[1:29:42] doesn't matter how it tries to hit you
[1:29:44] the radar has gotten covered prayer but
[1:29:53] if you look at and say well oh been a
[1:30:02] rough rough rough week rough time my
[1:30:05] goodness I ain't seen nothing on radar
[1:30:07] screen I didn't even heard it beep I
[1:30:10] just think it might be ok just to kind
[1:30:15] of relax you better not you better not
[1:30:18] about town there'll be some prayer
[1:30:24] praying always let Stan
[1:30:31] he is he is my defense this word defense
[1:30:40] means my high place my refuge this is
[1:30:47] what it means in Hebrew my stronghold my
[1:30:51] retreat must secure height in him he's
[1:30:59] my defense the high ground
[1:31:05] I shall not be greatly
[1:31:12] it's Satan's desire it's his intention
[1:31:18] to try to draw from that high ground to
[1:31:20] try to prevent you coming to the high
[1:31:22] ground and to try you try to move you
[1:31:25] from the high ground sees a lot of ways
[1:31:27] within the high ground there's things
[1:31:29] that we can say Lord where we in
[1:31:32] ourselves know there's times where we've
[1:31:35] been drawn out I'll say Amen for you it
[1:31:40] meant for me and Amen for you there's
[1:31:44] things that where Satan knows each and
[1:31:45] every one of us don't let that scare you
[1:31:48] God knows you in the Book of Psalms
[1:31:53] chapter 139 David said he knows my
[1:31:56] uprising in my down city he knows all
[1:31:59] about you your makeup he knows you
[1:32:10] he knows whether you're the type of
[1:32:12] person that in your makeup you might be
[1:32:14] a more outgoing person never met him
[1:32:16] never met a stranger in your life that's
[1:32:18] part of that's part of a makeup but then
[1:32:21] there's other makeups temperaments that
[1:32:23] it wouldn't matter if they met another
[1:32:25] person or not they're self-reliant now
[1:32:29] you can look at that and think brother
[1:32:32] Samuel I mean shouldn't everybody know
[1:32:36] we're not to be like one another but
[1:32:39] were to let Christ be the same in each
[1:32:41] of us he knows what he's doing and
[1:32:45] there's things that you would have to
[1:32:47] war against in your life and I would
[1:32:50] have to war against a matter of fact
[1:32:51] brother Bram called himself a melancholy
[1:32:53] person is that right the rest of the
[1:32:58] fellas are down brothers are down there
[1:33:00] shooting squirrels or to shoot him and
[1:33:01] killing him he's not shooting them and
[1:33:04] hitting them between the eyes or in the
[1:33:06] eye so he takes his gun puts it on the
[1:33:10] tree and starts crying why am i this way
[1:33:13] you know what did God say I made you
[1:33:17] that way that wasn't his new birth that
[1:33:21] was not a part of his new birth that was
[1:33:24] part of even the star that was born
[1:33:26] under the birth path remember the bad
[1:33:27] thoughts about those birth past birth
[1:33:30] paths here's the sign they born under
[1:33:32] and all those things working up in the
[1:33:34] temperament but you see God made it but
[1:33:36] that's to be yielded to him but the
[1:33:38] banth comes back around and he says
[1:33:40] concerning his own self
[1:33:41] how that he can be very melancholy and
[1:33:43] that's part of being melancholy as a
[1:33:44] perfectionist don't start trying to
[1:33:47] identify people here tonight but what
[1:33:50] I'm trying to get you to see is this
[1:33:51] right here you could look at that and
[1:33:53] say man that's a wonderful quality and
[1:33:55] it is but that same thing of
[1:33:57] perfectionism can be a negative if Satan
[1:34:01] gets into it it can line your wife up
[1:34:03] and line your husband up it can line the
[1:34:05] pastor a blind the church up it can and
[1:34:09] remember our perfection is in him
[1:34:12] and he is perfecting us but the same
[1:34:18] time brother branham comes to this place
[1:34:20] and he says you know what he says I know
[1:34:22] how the how this is he says in my life
[1:34:25] it's hard for me to say goodbye and he
[1:34:28] said I can't let myself get like this
[1:34:33] because when I do Satan takes advantage
[1:34:36] of me brother said what about the power
[1:34:39] of the new birth the power of the new
[1:34:41] birth places greater is He that's in you
[1:34:43] to where you've got a Dominion and
[1:34:45] authority to be able to recognize Satan
[1:34:48] and every one of his tricks live from
[1:34:53] the high ground from the high ground
[1:34:56] that that ground that says Lord in you
[1:35:00] in you you're my rest you are my peace
[1:35:06] tempted tempted to be drawn into the low
[1:35:10] ground but stay in the high ground for
[1:35:12] the high ground says the promise is sure
[1:35:16] Satan will come against you throw
[1:35:19] everything against the promise that
[1:35:22] you're holding in your heart but
[1:35:25] remember hold it
[1:35:27] treasure it give your all to it and say
[1:35:32] Lord even in this teach me and help me
[1:35:37] Lord because I believe with him in our
[1:35:42] lives we we don't have an excuse but we
[1:35:47] have the mighty Conqueror greater is He
[1:35:51] that is in you than he that's in the
[1:35:54] world you love him tonight Amen let's
[1:35:59] just bow our heads
[1:36:03] maybe as the music is being played I
[1:36:05] wonder if there be any heart here
[1:36:07] tonight that say Lord I just want to so
[1:36:11] fully give myself to you Lord what I'm
[1:36:13] I'm hearing Lord I want to so fully give
[1:36:16] myself to you father you know the needs
[1:36:20] that up on my heart and Lord just with
[1:36:24] an uplifted hand with an open heart
[1:36:26] behind in the Lord God bless you tonight

[1:36:31] he sees your need he sees that you're a
[1:36:34] new who was there just that
[1:36:36] acknowledging it defies gravity it
[1:36:39] defies the pressure that could come
[1:36:42] around us I've had this request before
[1:36:44] or or could it really be for me yes it's
[1:36:47] for you yes he cares yes he loves you

[1:37:12] that we can come to you Lord taking all

[1:38:39] and bring what would seem to be such a
[1:38:42] bleakness and a darkness nobody can come
