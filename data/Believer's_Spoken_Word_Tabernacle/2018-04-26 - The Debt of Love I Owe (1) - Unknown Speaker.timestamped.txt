[24:22] Colossians chapter 1 verse 23 I want to
[24:24] go right there tonight
[24:26] man
[24:47] and I just want to break in on this
[24:50] passage of reading right here verse 23
[25:07] if you continue in the faith grounded
[25:10] and settled and be not moved away from
[25:13] the hope of the gospel which he have
[25:16] heard and which was preached to every
[25:19] creature which is under heaven where of
[25:22] I Paul am made a minister
[25:25] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[25:29] and that's this is the verse I want to
[25:31] really hone in on Paul's admonishing the
[25:34] people of God of what God has done for
[25:37] them and I believe this is where it
[25:39] speaks to us then Paul he speaks that
[25:43] this is why I was made a minister we
[25:46] know that Paul was that gift already
[25:48] laid there but this is something that
[25:50] lay within Paul's life that God brought
[25:53] Paul to the realization - and now Paul
[25:56] look what he says in verse 24 who now
[25:59] rejoice in my sufferings for you now
[26:07] this is one thing yeah it's it's one
[26:09] thing to be have victory in that we can
[26:12] rejoice in our sufferings but this is
[26:15] even greater who rejoice now in my
[26:18] sufferings for you
[26:21] so his sufferings that he's speaking
[26:23] about wasn't about him it was for the
[26:28] people and fill up now watch this this
[26:32] blast next part and fill up that which
[26:35] is behind of the afflictions of Christ
[26:39] how many know there's a measure of
[26:41] suffering that's left for us there's a
[26:43] measure of suffering that's left for us
[26:45] the Bible says that if we do not suffer
[26:48] with him we shall not reign with him so
[26:51] there's a measure of suffering that is
[26:54] left certainly not to the same measure
[26:56] that Christ himself bore but there is a
[27:00] a measure that is left and fill up that
[27:03] which is behind of the afflictions of
[27:05] Christ in my flesh for his body's sake
[27:09] notice in my flesh for his body's sake
[27:12] which is the church
[27:14] amen may God bless you tonight as you're
[27:17] being seated I'd like to speak tonight
[27:24] at least be
