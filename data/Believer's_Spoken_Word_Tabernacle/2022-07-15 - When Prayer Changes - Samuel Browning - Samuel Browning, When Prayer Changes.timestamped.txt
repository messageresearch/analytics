[36:29] amen let's just we're going to ask you
[36:31] turn in your bibles to deuteronomy
[36:33] chapter 28 and i'm going to read two
[36:34] verses of scripture there
[36:37] and then we'll let you be seated
[36:45] in
[36:46] deuteronomy chapter 2
[36:49] 28 sorry 28 and
[36:52] verse 1
[36:55] and it shall come to pass
[36:57] if thou shalt hearken diligently unto
[36:59] the voice of the lord thy god
[37:02] to observe and to do all his
[37:04] commandments which i command thee this
[37:07] day
[37:08] that the lord thy god will set thee
[37:11] on high above all nations
[37:14] of the earth
[37:16] and all these blessings shall come on
[37:18] thee
[37:19] and overtake thee
[37:21] if thou shalt hearken unto the voice
[37:24] of the lord thy god
[37:28] amen may god add his blessing to the
[37:30] word as you're being seated
[37:34] i'd like to just speak to you tonight
[37:37] on a thought
[37:40] and that is when prayer
[37:43] changes
[37:44] when prayer changes and maybe just to
[37:47] read
[37:49] of a quote of where i'm
[37:52] going to move to here tonight but
[37:54] brother branham is speaking of how he
[37:56] says where
[37:57] many are saying
[37:59] brother branham you pray for me today
[38:01] brother branham you pray for me today
[38:03] and brother braham says it like this he
[38:05] says you get over in canaan once brother
[38:08] and then you realize where you belong
[38:12] watch prayer start being turned around
[38:16] notice what he's saying it isn't that he
[38:17] brother bradman's not saying in this
[38:19] quote that we don't ask one another to
[38:21] pray for us
[38:23] but in other words where an individual
[38:25] comes to a place
[38:26] that that they recognize that the same
[38:30] god
[38:30] who is moving through the prophet in
[38:32] that hour
[38:34] that he's my god to
[38:36] that i'm not anything less i'm not a
[38:39] prophet you're not a prophet
[38:41] but god brought the realization to you
[38:43] and i in this hour
[38:45] that through that that calling of a
[38:47] prophet that god placed here that that
[38:50] gift that god sent in this hour and
[38:52] ordained that was to open a channel in a
[38:55] realm that was already here but we
[38:58] needed to tap into it
[39:01] and god sent eyes in this hour that of
[39:05] which that a prophet that's what
[39:06] distinguishes a prophet from all other
[39:10] gifts of the ministry
[39:12] because the prophet itself when god
[39:14] sends it remember this fulfillment in
[39:16] this hour
[39:18] is the same ministry of the lord jesus
[39:20] christ that's reproduced again through
[39:24] human flesh
[39:25] and it was to tap in in other words to
[39:28] let you and i know
[39:30] as god not just in the knowing because
[39:32] this is not a field this is not theology
[39:35] but god here making himself known
[39:38] through an open channel of his word in
[39:41] this hour that you and i can clearly see
[39:44] this is who i am
[39:47] so the message itself
[39:50] is not revealing brother branham the
[39:52] message is revealing jesus christ
[39:55] and as that revelation of jesus christ
[39:57] sets forth to our life then it's through
[40:00] that revelation that we come to the
[40:02] realization of who we really are
[40:05] and when we recognize who we are this is
[40:08] what brother branham is saying here and
[40:09] we're working towards this tonight is
[40:11] then you recognize where you belong over
[40:15] in canaan and then you watch your prayer
[40:18] start being turned around then
[40:21] so as we look at this this scripture
[40:24] here
[40:25] of what god has declared in deuteronomy
[40:29] 28
[40:30] of how it shall come to pass there's no
[40:33] uncertainty about this when god has made
[40:35] a promise
[40:36] it will come to pass
[40:39] now sometimes there's been like as
[40:42] paul writes in the book of romans under
[40:43] inspiration because some did not believe
[40:46] has that hindered god not at all
[40:49] god knew those that would not believe
[40:52] but god when he spoke it he's got
[40:54] somebody in mind that that word is going
[40:57] to be fulfilled through
[41:00] and and it has nothing to do with that
[41:01] person's goodness it has everything to
[41:04] do with his word
[41:06] and who he is
[41:07] so god speaks not with a maybe or a
[41:10] might but it shall come to pass
[41:14] it shall come to pass that's why when
[41:16] the scripture says in john chapter 1
[41:19] that to them that to them that received
[41:23] him
[41:24] to them gave he the power or the
[41:27] authority to become
[41:30] sons of god
[41:31] and that word is become means to come to
[41:34] pass
[41:36] we're always the son and daughter of god
[41:38] but the word must come to pass in our
[41:41] life
[41:42] it moves from just being a seed of
[41:44] promise from just being a desire in our
[41:47] life
[41:48] but to actually be coming
[41:50] it is the now theme of our life to where
[41:54] it's no longer just a word because
[41:55] remember anyone can dispute with a
[41:58] promise but when the promise is made
[42:01] manifest it settles all disputes
[42:05] because the word has come to pass and
[42:07] the word has declared itself and this is
[42:10] what the god is speaking through moses
[42:12] it shall come to pass in other words god
[42:16] shall surely declare his word
[42:19] and in the declaring of his word notice
[42:23] how god will declare his word
[42:25] if thou shalt hearken to his voice so he
[42:29] has to be able to hear his voice
[42:31] be able to recognize his voice what is
[42:33] the voice of the lord it is his word he
[42:36] speaks through his word it's the voice
[42:38] of the holy spirit that takes a promise
[42:41] and it's no longer reading it and
[42:43] reciting it but it's declaring this is
[42:46] the season this is the moment this is
[42:49] the time and it's the spirit of god
[42:51] doing that that raises up in a life and
[42:54] that life begins to respond to him who
[42:57] is the word
[42:59] so what is it it's the word responding
[43:01] to the word
[43:03] so now notice god's promise through that
[43:06] of obedience to the word of god because
[43:09] i don't it doesn't matter whatever that
[43:11] that you might you or i might do there
[43:13] is nothing higher in the order of god
[43:16] than obedience to the word of god
[43:18] there's nothing that you and i can grow
[43:21] you know we could give fruit baskets to
[43:23] the poor we could do everything in the
[43:25] world but but obedience
[43:28] it is greater than all of that remember
[43:30] when saul came back and said i've got
[43:32] good things to sacrifice to you here and
[43:35] god let him know through the prophet
[43:37] that i what i have spoken in my word the
[43:39] greatest obedience that you could have
[43:41] done was let your life be a sacrifice to
[43:45] your own will sacrifice your own will to
[43:48] the will of god and god said that's
[43:50] greater honor obedience is better than
[43:53] any sacrifice that's why the holy spirit
[43:56] would take the message enticing spirits
[43:59] and he would deal with that same thing
[44:01] in this hour where people will rely upon
[44:04] speaking in tongues or their fasting and
[44:06] all of those things are are
[44:08] are are our gifts and attributes of god
[44:11] but the holy spirit was ministering when
[44:13] we take an enticing spirit or rely upon
[44:16] anything rather than full obedience to
[44:19] the word of god that is an enticing
[44:21] spirit
[44:22] against the word of god
[44:24] so there's nothing greater that you and
[44:26] i can ever give to god and there's no
[44:28] greater respect that we can give to him
[44:31] than to obey his word and obedience is
[44:34] not something of the mind but obedience
[44:37] is that of the heart and you know when a
[44:40] person walking with god obedience
[44:42] doesn't mean you have to know it you
[44:44] have to understand it obedience is to
[44:46] know that god has spoken and we submit
[44:49] our lives to his voice and say lord you
[44:52] have spoken it it shall come to pass
[44:56] you've not asked me to figure out how
[44:58] you have spoken it and we yield in our
[45:01] heart the amen begins within a soul be
[45:05] it lord
[45:06] so god has made a promise here in this
[45:09] verse 1 that he will set you above in
[45:12] other words god will place you in
[45:15] position and it will be a work of the
[45:18] lord by his word no you cannot come into
[45:21] position with god outside of the word of
[45:24] god so it is the word that god sends in
[45:27] an hour in a season that will actually
[45:30] bring the people of god
[45:32] in position not to think about it when
[45:34] that word is moving and ministering to
[45:36] your life it is bringing you into the
[45:39] position of the word itself so that your
[45:42] life becomes a display or a billboard of
[45:46] the word of god that has been written
[45:49] now it has been expressed by the spirit
[45:52] now your life expresses that word
[45:56] so in position of that word it is the
[45:59] word of god nothing else that will bring
[46:02] us into position not and think of that
[46:05] the lord thy god will set thee on high
[46:08] above all the nations of the earth so
[46:10] god will place you by his word where you
[46:14] belong
[46:15] anybody ever been anywhere where you
[46:16] felt like i don't belong here
[46:19] i mean i felt that way many different
[46:21] times i don't belong here but god is
[46:23] letting you and i know that the word
[46:25] itself will actually place you where you
[46:29] belong because it's the word that holds
[46:32] the call of the homeland and it calls
[46:36] you back to where you belong this is why
[46:38] through the scriptures even we see when
[46:40] israel would begin gathering back to the
[46:42] homeland and the trumpets were sounding
[46:45] out there and they were coming in and
[46:47] gathering and under all sorts of
[46:49] persecution and gathering back in the
[46:51] land it was a supernatural gathering of
[46:55] the spirit of god that would begin to
[46:57] put into the heart of the jews to return
[46:59] to their homeland
[47:01] it was not a work of man the the the
[47:04] things that you see within the hearts of
[47:06] the individuals that they would move in
[47:08] there and the perseverance that they
[47:09] would have that was not that of man's
[47:12] ingenuity but it was the spirit of god
[47:15] that would move upon them and would
[47:18] actually move them beyond all of their
[47:20] doubts all of their unbelief all about
[47:22] everything that was there
[47:24] because god is determined to fulfill his
[47:28] word and all he needs is vessels that
[47:31] will obey him and yield to his word and
[47:34] god said i'll take care of the rest of
[47:37] it
[47:38] oh my i will place you where you belong
[47:40] i will put you in position now notice i
[47:43] will place you i will set you on high
[47:46] above all the nations of the earth and
[47:48] all these blessings
[47:50] shall come on thee and over take thee oh
[47:53] i love that if thou shalt hearken unto
[47:56] the voice of the lord now notice all the
[47:58] blessings shall come and they will
[48:01] actually overtake you let me just say it
[48:03] like this you and i were not seeking
[48:06] after god
[48:08] god was seeking after us
[48:12] god is the one who came knocking and
[48:14] dealing with our life now how many times
[48:17] then maybe you looked at something in
[48:19] your life and said well i'm not worthy
[48:21] but god even knocking on your heart was
[48:23] letting you know it's not about your
[48:26] worthiness
[48:29] it's god's desire to do for you what
[48:34] only he can do
[48:38] these blessings shall come upon you it's
[48:40] a blessing the bible said blessed are
[48:43] they who do hunger and thirst for
[48:45] righteousness they shall be filled it's
[48:49] a blessing to desire the holy ghost
[48:52] it's a blessing that has come upon you
[48:55] and the spirit of god dealing with your
[48:57] life and that blessing overtakes your
[49:00] life let me just say this it's not you
[49:02] receiving the holy ghost it's the holy
[49:05] ghost accepting you
[49:08] these blessings shall overtake me
[49:12] oh aren't you glad when god begins to
[49:13] deal with our life the greatest thing we
[49:15] can do is open our life and say lord
[49:17] overtake me lord
[49:20] saturate me lord overwhelm my life oh
[49:23] god with your presence
[49:26] now i'm going to look at this this
[49:28] scripture here just for a minute or this
[49:30] word and all these blessings shall come
[49:33] on thee and overtake thee now this word
[49:35] blessings the very first plan that ever
[49:37] appears in the scripture is genesis 12 2
[49:40] where god says to abraham i will make of
[49:43] thee a great nation and i will bless
[49:46] thee and make thy name great and thou
[49:50] shalt be a blessing
[49:53] oh glory be to god i'll tell you every
[49:55] one of them parts we could just preach
[49:56] on it but i want to just deal with that
[49:58] that reality that it is god's working it
[50:02] is god who has already declared this is
[50:04] what i
[50:05] will do
[50:07] now all god asked of abraham is is to
[50:10] yield in obedience to me when when you
[50:13] can't understand yet obey me because
[50:16] what i have said i will perform it don't
[50:19] try to figure it out don't try to when
[50:21] i'm gonna try to understand it we see
[50:24] that even in abraham's life and let's
[50:26] just be real we can see it in our own
[50:28] life
[50:30] where we can try to understand things
[50:32] remember abraham had a lot of
[50:34] misunderstandings that had happened in
[50:36] the journey but brother brown could
[50:38] stand there and tell us in the message
[50:39] look abraham chose not to focus on the
[50:43] misunderstandings of the promise you and
[50:46] i've had a lot of misunderstandings in
[50:47] our lives about things whether it's
[50:49] things we've fought we believe or we've
[50:51] spoke but you remember abraham chose to
[50:55] not focus on the misunderstandings
[50:57] because we can only know as god will
[51:00] reveal his word to us and the greatest
[51:03] thing we can do is back to obedience
[51:05] then lord i don't understand this right
[51:07] now but you have promised it you will
[51:10] bring it to pass and to realize that the
[51:12] word coming to pass god's also got to
[51:15] bring us into the right condition for
[51:18] the word to come to pass
[51:20] this is not just a one-way street where
[51:22] i'm just waiting on god but the working
[51:24] of the holy spirit to bring the promise
[51:27] to pass is also god working on our lives
[51:31] in submission to
[51:34] him now to think of that thou shalt be a
[51:38] blessing this word is used here and it's
[51:40] a word that means a source of blessing
[51:43] or that which would be a praise of god
[51:46] thou shalt be a blessing so we recognize
[51:49] that god dealing with abraham that it
[51:52] would not be abraham's natural seed
[51:55] although there would be a natural
[51:56] lineage but it would not be through the
[51:59] natural seed that we would receive the
[52:02] blessing not to isaac but we receive the
[52:05] blessing of abraham through christ
[52:08] this blessing that we're talking about
[52:10] of even what god would show in tight to
[52:13] abraham when god would take abraham and
[52:16] confirm the covenant would show him a
[52:18] vision of calvary in genesis 15. he
[52:21] would show abraham the working that i
[52:23] what i have said i have confirmed it i
[52:26] will surely bring it to pass in other
[52:28] words if i don't do what i have said
[52:31] then let me be as dead as good as a dead
[52:34] man but how many know that god can't lie
[52:37] god's never made a promise that he ever
[52:39] had to back up on god's never made a
[52:41] promise and said oh man i shouldn't have
[52:44] made that promise i didn't realize how
[52:45] dark it was going to be i didn't realize
[52:47] how sinful it was going to be i didn't
[52:49] realize how bad it was going to be let
[52:50] me tell you something the same promise
[52:52] that god gave back there it still works
[52:55] tonight then it doesn't matter how dark
[52:58] it is it doesn't matter how black it is
[53:00] it doesn't matter the situation because
[53:03] god who made the promise he hadn't
[53:05] changed one bit his power hadn't
[53:08] diminished his authority as the saved
[53:10] all glory be to god then we can have a
[53:13] solidness and say it shall come to pass
[53:17] it shall come to pass
[53:20] whatever the promise is in your life you
[53:23] can stand with god's word and say it
[53:25] shall come to pass let me tell you
[53:28] something it's coming to pass even in
[53:30] your attitude right now
[53:33] are you hearing me it's coming to pass
[53:35] even as you even taking it into the
[53:38] natural mind marriage and dropping down
[53:40] it is coming to pass you are not
[53:43] declaring something of your own power
[53:46] you are declaring who god has revealed
[53:48] to you that he's above this
[53:52] [Music]
[53:54] so it's not abraham's natural seed that
[53:56] we receive the blessing through
[53:59] paul would write it like this in
[54:00] galatians 3
[54:02] christ hath redeemed us
[54:04] from the curse of the law
[54:06] being made a curse for us for it is
[54:08] written cursed is everyone that hangeth
[54:11] on a tree
[54:12] that the blessing of abraham this
[54:15] blessing of abraham is the holy ghost
[54:19] might come on the gentiles through jesus
[54:22] christ you see we had no access into the
[54:25] covenant
[54:27] are you hearing me we had no access into
[54:30] the covenant we were like rahab we had
[54:32] no access into the covenant we were like
[54:34] ruth had no access into the covenant
[54:36] we were like the daughters of zolofia we
[54:39] had no access into the covenant
[54:41] there had to be one that would be able
[54:44] to span the breach there had to be one
[54:47] that could put his hand upon our life
[54:49] and tie us back into the promise of god
[54:52] that is the mystery of god the mystery
[54:55] of god is the holy ghost
[54:58] amen it's him who has come
[55:01] that through christ it is revealed and
[55:03] we are brought into position
[55:07] we've not been made church members
[55:10] we now have been brought into the
[55:13] reality as sons and daughters of god
[55:17] where we
[55:18] belong where we belong
[55:22] notice he redeemed us he he bought us
[55:25] back remember when uh
[55:27] joseph brought out the two sons of eve
[55:29] from manasseh and he brought him there
[55:31] to to israel to jacob and he asked him
[55:34] to bless him remember the blessing
[55:37] belonged to the firstborn is that right
[55:39] but notice how about jacob he began when
[55:42] he went to pray
[55:44] his hands were crossed now joseph is
[55:47] looking upon it and joseph is looking
[55:50] and saying hey what you're doing is not
[55:52] right but jacob responds to him and says
[55:55] it is not what i have done but god has
[55:58] crossed my hands
[56:00] i haven't done this
[56:03] let me say this to you it wasn't you
[56:05] that conferred this blessing upon your
[56:07] life it is not you that was good enough
[56:10] to confer this blessing that you would
[56:12] hear the voice of god and it would deal
[56:15] with your life it is a work of almighty
[56:18] god
[56:20] jacob stood there and testified to
[56:23] joseph i had not done this but god has
[56:26] crossed my hands it was a showing in
[56:29] prophecy that though the the the the
[56:33] blessing belonged to the firstborn it
[56:35] belonged to the jews the covenants all
[56:38] those things that were promised to them
[56:40] but god made a cross in there
[56:43] back through jesus christ the blessings
[56:46] the adoption everything that pertained
[56:49] to that of the jews it now comes upon
[56:52] the gentiles the mystery of christ that
[56:55] will lift a gentile bride in position it
[56:59] is the lord that has set thee on high
[57:01] let me tell you something you can look
[57:03] at that in your own life and when it
[57:05] says it shall come to pass you can say
[57:07] take that devil it might look as black
[57:10] it might look as impossible it might
[57:12] look like there ain't nothing can happen
[57:14] but let me tell you something when god
[57:16] has said something god is there to order
[57:20] lives even when jacob might have wanted
[57:22] to go this way but the spirit of god
[57:25] brought their hands across
[57:30] well we could preach there for a minute
[57:33] [Music]
[57:35] but i'm just going to stay here
[57:37] oh i crossed my hand so that the
[57:38] blessing of abraham
[57:40] it has come upon us
[57:42] through jesus christ now paul would
[57:44] write of this in ephesians 1 verse 3
[57:47] blessed be the god and father of our
[57:48] lord jesus christ who hath
[57:51] blessed us
[57:53] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[57:56] places in christ
[57:58] now paul remember the mystery
[58:01] of god is made known to paul concerning
[58:04] the gentiles
[58:06] right peter saw the spirit of god fall
[58:08] upon the gentiles they can't dispute it
[58:11] right in the house of cornelius it fell
[58:13] down upon them right
[58:15] then after it fell peter remember what
[58:17] he was speaking he says you cannot
[58:19] dispute the coming of the holy spirit
[58:22] upon those lives
[58:25] who are we see when the holy spirit has
[58:26] come now it brought a reality because
[58:29] peter is one that is identified and born
[58:32] of the spirit of god of the word and he
[58:34] recognizes his position who are we to
[58:37] say anything against that which the holy
[58:40] spirit has come and did oh glory be to
[58:43] god and notice they walked on into the
[58:45] water of baptism now this is what i i
[58:48] want you to to notice and just let it
[58:50] drop in just so deep that paul is
[58:53] sounding out here
[58:54] under an inspiration of what was before
[58:57] the foundation of the world is now being
[59:01] unfolded you know our minds cannot go
[59:03] back to the foundation of the world our
[59:05] memory cannot go back there but there is
[59:07] a representation of a spiritual seed on
[59:10] the inside there's just something it
[59:12] raises up because we can't explain it i
[59:15] can't say oh i remember being there i
[59:17] don't remember being there but whoa when
[59:19] the presence of god begins to come
[59:21] around the presence of god to a believer
[59:24] is not something that's foreign even to
[59:27] a lot that has not been born again when
[59:29] the spirit of god begins to come around
[59:32] it's something about it it just sounds
[59:34] like home this is a glove that's fitting
[59:37] me i'm hearing that eagle above it's
[59:40] something about it that's taking a hold
[59:42] of my life what is it it's the mystery
[59:44] of god working in your life to draw you
[59:48] and call you and lift you from all
[59:50] unbelief
[59:52] so it in what you can figure out
[59:54] you can't know god by your mind
[59:58] you know god by faith to believe him for
[1:00:02] what he has said the god that deals with
[1:00:04] your life the god that works with you
[1:00:07] the greatest thing you can do is open up
[1:00:09] and invite him to speak personally
[1:00:13] what he's doing in the service let me
[1:00:14] tell you something jesus don't just sit
[1:00:16] on a pew he'll go right with you to your
[1:00:18] home
[1:00:20] are you hearing me this word will
[1:00:22] continue to speak with you
[1:00:25] blessed now let me get into the blessed
[1:00:27] be the god and father of our lord jesus
[1:00:29] christ
[1:00:30] who hath
[1:00:32] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:00:34] in heavenly places in christ
[1:00:38] so that position was already given
[1:00:40] just as much
[1:00:42] as when israel when those mothers
[1:00:46] under inspiration from god
[1:00:49] when they gave name
[1:00:51] to those children
[1:00:54] it was they were not looking through a
[1:00:55] baby book
[1:00:57] are you hearing me
[1:00:59] you know and saying you know maybe
[1:01:01] they've been thinking what am i going to
[1:01:02] call my baby but there was an
[1:01:04] inspiration of god that dropped down
[1:01:09] is that all right they were in tune with
[1:01:11] with another book and the author and
[1:01:13] there was an inspiration that dropped
[1:01:15] and do you realize that name itself when
[1:01:17] it dropped by divine inspiration held
[1:01:19] their placement in the land of promise
[1:01:22] when they went in to take the land of
[1:01:24] promise there wasn't them casting lots
[1:01:27] of who gets this and who gets this it
[1:01:29] was already determined from the mind of
[1:01:32] god
[1:01:33] and let me say this this message it was
[1:01:36] already determined in this hour when he
[1:01:39] said behold i sinned unto you elijah the
[1:01:42] prophet you are already a part of that
[1:01:45] intended target known you god knew that
[1:01:48] you would be here in this hour and he
[1:01:50] knew the inspiration of his name being
[1:01:53] revealed in this hour and the effect
[1:01:56] that he would have upon your life he
[1:01:58] knew it would stir something in you that
[1:02:00] you would say i've got to take my
[1:02:02] position i've got to have my possession
[1:02:06] a church can't do that to you
[1:02:10] there ain't enough fellowship dinners in
[1:02:12] the world to do that to you it takes the
[1:02:14] presence of almighty god coming down and
[1:02:17] he is your father
[1:02:20] [Applause]
[1:02:23] glory be to god that's why the prophet
[1:02:24] could say in the adoption series he said
[1:02:27] you cannot learn the mystery of god in a
[1:02:30] seminary he said there ain't cinnamon
[1:02:32] areas that teach the mystery of god you
[1:02:34] realize what he's saying that the
[1:02:35] mystery of god is the working of the
[1:02:38] holy ghost
[1:02:41] seminaries cannot teach that that is
[1:02:43] that is god personally coming down and
[1:02:46] unfolding himself to you
[1:02:49] oh my
[1:02:51] overriding our rebellion overriding all
[1:02:54] of our unbelief overriding all of our
[1:02:56] doubt what is it the blessing of god has
[1:02:59] come upon you
[1:03:01] to overtake you
[1:03:03] oh glory be to god not just to come upon
[1:03:06] you but to overtake you to change your
[1:03:09] life completely
[1:03:11] this is not a blessing that you only
[1:03:13] feel in church and then when you walk
[1:03:15] outside it lives off your life that's
[1:03:17] not what the blessing of god is but the
[1:03:20] blessing of god is it brings you into
[1:03:22] your rightful position of where you
[1:03:26] rightfully belong
[1:03:31] oh glory oh my notice as according as he
[1:03:35] hath chosen us in him before the
[1:03:37] foundation of the world that we should
[1:03:39] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:03:42] love now he chose that so because that
[1:03:45] that choosing now how could god choose
[1:03:46] that this is predestination how could
[1:03:49] god choose it because god is declaring
[1:03:52] remember his word is a finished work
[1:03:56] when isaiah was moved by the spirit of
[1:03:58] god in isaiah 53 he does not speak under
[1:04:01] the spirit of god as something that
[1:04:03] shall be but he declares he was wounded
[1:04:07] from our transgression he was bruised
[1:04:11] for our iniquity the chastisement of our
[1:04:13] peace was upon him so he is declaring it
[1:04:17] in a finished work because it's a
[1:04:20] finished work from the mind of god it
[1:04:22] was already settled can't you see that
[1:04:25] the devil that's tried to torment you
[1:04:27] he's already been defeated
[1:04:31] he wasn't just defeated at calvary he
[1:04:34] was defeated from the mind of god this
[1:04:37] is the great drama the great act of
[1:04:39] almighty god that's being unfolded by
[1:04:43] the master himself
[1:04:46] hallelujah glory to god
[1:04:48] according as he had chosen us you have
[1:04:51] not been chosen to be defeatable
[1:04:55] you have not been anointed to succumb to
[1:04:58] satan's evil you have not been anointed
[1:05:01] to be defeated by lady osea you have
[1:05:04] been chosen to be victorious in jesus
[1:05:07] christ
[1:05:09] take that devil
[1:05:11] you need to say that take that devil
[1:05:15] i've not been chosen to be defeated i've
[1:05:18] been chosen to stand in victory
[1:05:21] to walk in the glory of god
[1:05:23] [Applause]
[1:05:25] according as he hath chosen us
[1:05:28] in him
[1:05:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:33] i know i'm going to say something pretty
[1:05:34] simple
[1:05:35] it was real simple
[1:05:37] but you know what
[1:05:39] all along
[1:05:41] this
[1:05:42] young man right here
[1:05:44] benjamin and zachary
[1:05:46] all three of them
[1:05:49] they were in me
[1:05:51] the whole time
[1:05:54] are you with me
[1:05:56] i didn't all of a sudden one day go hunt
[1:05:58] him up on the street and say hey you
[1:05:59] want to be my boy
[1:06:02] hey hey man hey tell you what i'll give
[1:06:04] you i'll give you some good candy
[1:06:06] i find out what you really like
[1:06:08] that's not predestination
[1:06:11] predestination this is a settled plan
[1:06:15] and work of god
[1:06:18] it doesn't mean that there's everything
[1:06:21] we're going to be pulled through a pipe
[1:06:22] no
[1:06:23] it's the spirit of the author
[1:06:26] of the word coming upon our life that
[1:06:30] brings us to repentance
[1:06:33] that sanctifies us and brings us in to
[1:06:37] jesus christ our rightful position
[1:06:40] you remove the spiritual seed and your
[1:06:43] life is like a cell phone without a sim
[1:06:46] card
[1:06:49] you could try to get a call you want
[1:06:52] but there's no sim card in it
[1:06:55] is that right you got to have a sim card
[1:06:57] what does that sim card do once that sim
[1:07:00] card is there in this phone i remember
[1:07:02] when i got this phone specifically i had
[1:07:04] to put that little itty bitty thing in
[1:07:06] there with my big fat fingers on my desk
[1:07:09] and i'm putting that sim card in there
[1:07:11] now you do realize on that sim card i
[1:07:13] don't know how in the world i ever read
[1:07:14] it but on that sim card is little
[1:07:17] numbers that are wrote on it and i had
[1:07:20] to call a member of verizon and let them
[1:07:23] know this is what the sim card says
[1:07:27] you see what i'm doing i am declaring
[1:07:29] what is wrote on that sim card and when
[1:07:32] that man in the network he receives that
[1:07:37] however he does it puts it on in other
[1:07:39] words i now have made it through the
[1:07:42] gate or the entryway i've been baptized
[1:07:45] into the network i am now able to
[1:07:47] receive calls i'm able to receive
[1:07:49] messages not because i've got a phone
[1:07:52] but because i've got a sim card that i
[1:07:55] can read the numbers and say this is
[1:07:57] what i belong to let me tell you what
[1:08:00] the word is doing in your life the word
[1:08:02] is letting you know this is where you
[1:08:04] belong what should i do say what the
[1:08:07] word says about you say amen to the word
[1:08:11] of god and you'll find yourself
[1:08:13] receiving texts receiving images from
[1:08:16] almighty god where you think of yourself
[1:08:19] defeated yet god will send you an image
[1:08:21] of victory a power and of glory
[1:08:23] [Music]
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:30] oh hallelujah
[1:08:31] aren't you glad about that tonight
[1:08:34] so according as he had chosen us i
[1:08:36] didn't choose him are you hearing me i
[1:08:38] didn't choose him
[1:08:40] well by the time you had to make a
[1:08:42] choice because you're on free more
[1:08:43] agency that's true but remember when he
[1:08:46] passed by my way
[1:08:49] same way it was with andrew same way it
[1:08:51] was with peter same way it was with john
[1:08:54] on and on and on and on same way it was
[1:08:56] with paul
[1:08:57] jesus never had to put him in a headlock
[1:08:59] he never had to put him a noose around
[1:09:01] their neck and drag him
[1:09:02] he just made himself known to them
[1:09:06] and they began to stir up that seed on
[1:09:09] the inside to the presence of its maker
[1:09:15] so it is not us that has chosen him he
[1:09:18] has chosen us
[1:09:20] and the choosing of god it begins to it
[1:09:23] is revealed through the word of god
[1:09:26] so how do we come into position i will
[1:09:29] set thee on high it is by the word of
[1:09:31] god and obeying the word
[1:09:35] notice having predestinated us
[1:09:38] unto the placement or position of
[1:09:41] children now that word adoption is not
[1:09:42] like we think of it here where we go out
[1:09:44] and we take somebody who is not of our
[1:09:46] loins
[1:09:47] in other words they're not of our family
[1:09:48] that's not what this word adoption means
[1:09:50] here this word adoption is your
[1:09:52] placement
[1:09:53] or your position
[1:09:55] we remember we could not get in position
[1:09:58] ruth could not get in position without
[1:10:00] boaz
[1:10:03] ruth was ordained already to be a
[1:10:05] channel that the word was going to come
[1:10:06] through
[1:10:07] i don't care if she was a moabite that
[1:10:09] seed wasn't a moabite
[1:10:13] i don't care if it was ray have the
[1:10:14] harlot that seed was no harlot
[1:10:20] i don't care if you can look at tomorrow
[1:10:22] and say how could she do that it was
[1:10:24] what was on the inside it was christ
[1:10:26] motivating her to move to take seed in
[1:10:30] that hour
[1:10:31] [Applause]
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:33] how could
[1:10:34] the daughters of zolofia come into
[1:10:36] position there was nobody to bring them
[1:10:39] into their inheritance but there had to
[1:10:41] be someone of their father's tribe that
[1:10:44] would step forward and through a union
[1:10:47] of marriage they would receive their
[1:10:50] inheritance
[1:10:52] you see this is why for you and i we are
[1:10:54] we are not the husband we are not the
[1:10:57] leader we are not the ruler we as the
[1:10:59] wife of jesus christ we submit ourself
[1:11:02] to the word and the word brings us into
[1:11:06] our rightful position
[1:11:08] [Applause]
[1:11:11] having predestinated us so predestinated
[1:11:14] is that of election are you with me now
[1:11:17] i'm just trying to drag my feet a little
[1:11:19] bit here election looks back to foreign
[1:11:21] knowledge
[1:11:22] in other words god already remember this
[1:11:25] is the plan of god
[1:11:27] there is nothing that is happening
[1:11:28] that's out of order
[1:11:31] remember joseph thought it was out of
[1:11:33] order god said it's right in order you
[1:11:35] may not understand it but it's right in
[1:11:38] order everything is happening right on
[1:11:41] time
[1:11:43] all right this is god's plan this is the
[1:11:46] whole drama that's laid out right here
[1:11:50] and the inspiration of god notice
[1:11:52] election looks back to foreign knowledge
[1:11:55] knowing that god
[1:11:57] he foreknows he knows
[1:11:59] god knew friends let me tell you
[1:12:01] something
[1:12:02] god knew of even all the struggles you
[1:12:05] and i would have with coming to
[1:12:06] recognize who we are
[1:12:09] god knew let me tell you this god knew
[1:12:11] of the times that he would deal with our
[1:12:13] heart we could have sat in the meeting
[1:12:15] and we didn't yield but that didn't
[1:12:17] change his mind
[1:12:19] you realize that the experience of the
[1:12:22] holy ghost the prophet tells us in
[1:12:24] satan's eden it's not schooled into you
[1:12:27] you don't learn the holy ghost it's an
[1:12:30] experience predestinated
[1:12:33] from the hand of almighty god god knew
[1:12:36] the time god knew the place
[1:12:38] and what's most important is is that you
[1:12:41] know you've been changed
[1:12:42] [Applause]
[1:12:45] god had all of this prearranged
[1:12:52] glory be to god in the highest
[1:12:54] having predestinated us into the
[1:12:56] placement of children
[1:12:58] by who
[1:12:59] by jesus christ
[1:13:01] to himself so you see what real
[1:13:04] positioning does
[1:13:06] it brings us to the word
[1:13:08] when the spirit of god is come the real
[1:13:12] evidence of the holy ghost is it moves
[1:13:14] you into the word
[1:13:16] to where your life you're able to save
[1:13:18] from your life there's an amen within
[1:13:21] you
[1:13:22] not that you are perfect but the desires
[1:13:24] of the world has gone and the desire
[1:13:27] that burns in your heart is to please
[1:13:29] him
[1:13:30] you love him because he first loved you
[1:13:35] that ain't just a scripture that's a
[1:13:37] reality that's a divine revelation like
[1:13:41] paul can say the life that i'm living
[1:13:43] now it's a different life but i'm living
[1:13:45] it by the revelation that he loved me
[1:13:48] first and his love has been projected to
[1:13:50] me now i'm not living in defeat i'm
[1:13:53] living in the victory of love divine
[1:13:59] according to the good pleasure
[1:14:02] of his will
[1:14:09] oh glory be to god
[1:14:11] brother brown would say that
[1:14:12] predestination it looks to destiny or
[1:14:13] predestination you take the word destiny
[1:14:15] so for knowledge god having
[1:14:17] foreknowledge now for knowledge looks
[1:14:19] ahead to destiny
[1:14:21] your destiny is not in question
[1:14:24] are you hearing me it was never in
[1:14:26] question before the foundation of the
[1:14:28] world but the holy spirit came down to
[1:14:31] lift you in position so you're no longer
[1:14:34] wondering but you're looking with a real
[1:14:38] reality i know in whom i have believed
[1:14:41] and i'm persuaded that he is able
[1:14:44] to keep that which i've committed
[1:14:45] against today
[1:14:47] and let's just let's just put this in
[1:14:49] here that becomes more real every day of
[1:14:52] your life
[1:14:56] are you hearing me now
[1:14:58] as you feed on the word it's building
[1:15:00] the faith the holy spirit is taking that
[1:15:02] word as the fire of god it's roasting
[1:15:05] that lamb and that word itself is moving
[1:15:07] it's working in your life what's it
[1:15:09] doing it's building faith faith in what
[1:15:11] faith in who you are
[1:15:14] to recognize the promises that belong to
[1:15:16] you
[1:15:17] because god does not reveal us who we
[1:15:19] are and then our action is we sit on a
[1:15:21] bench that's not what the revelation of
[1:15:23] who we are does
[1:15:25] the revelation of who we are puts us
[1:15:26] into action
[1:15:30] glory be to god
[1:15:31] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:15:33] wherein he hath
[1:15:36] made us
[1:15:37] accepted in the beloved
[1:15:40] can i just read it now brother brandon
[1:15:41] wrote it here in the or spoken in the
[1:15:43] adoption he says notice he said how that
[1:15:45] that election it looks back there and
[1:15:47] predestination looks to destiny don't
[1:15:50] forget that that election looks back
[1:15:52] here
[1:15:53] here it is see remember how god would
[1:15:55] tell israel when you come up against
[1:15:57] nations that are mightier than you
[1:15:58] because you're going to come up against
[1:15:59] some things that you can't control
[1:16:02] as far as in your natural but this is
[1:16:04] what god said god didn't god was making
[1:16:06] a deal about oh my you're afraid no god
[1:16:09] said when you are this is where i want
[1:16:10] you to look
[1:16:12] i want you to consider where god with
[1:16:15] this mighty hand and outstretched arm
[1:16:18] has brought you out of egypt
[1:16:20] i want you to remember how he crushed
[1:16:23] your enemies
[1:16:25] under his feet
[1:16:30] glory be to god when you are afraid
[1:16:32] remember when fear comes upon you when a
[1:16:35] doctor's report comes to you or
[1:16:37] something comes along my child's going
[1:16:39] this way i want you to remember that i'm
[1:16:41] the lord that brought you out i want you
[1:16:44] to remember it's i who did this so when
[1:16:46] fear comes you fight fear with the word
[1:16:50] of god and what is the word it's the
[1:16:52] working in your life you're not looking
[1:16:55] back to something a print you're looking
[1:16:57] back to see god brought me out it's a
[1:17:00] working of the word in my life
[1:17:05] i was a cockle burl
[1:17:07] i was born and sin shaped in iniquity
[1:17:10] and come to the world speaking lies born
[1:17:12] among sinners father and mother and my
[1:17:13] whole family sinners i was a of
[1:17:16] earl but all of a sudden i become a
[1:17:18] wheat grain
[1:17:19] how did that happen
[1:17:21] that's election
[1:17:22] god before the foundation of the world
[1:17:24] elected that tucker barrel and was to
[1:17:27] become a grain of wheat how does that
[1:17:29] happen
[1:17:32] god takes that of cocker bro it's
[1:17:34] ordained
[1:17:35] to become
[1:17:37] an expression of wheat
[1:17:39] so god opens up
[1:17:41] that kookaburra
[1:17:42] and he takes out the life and the nature
[1:17:45] that's there and he replaces it with
[1:17:48] wheat life
[1:17:50] talking about the blessing of abraham
[1:17:52] that he can close it right back up and
[1:17:54] though it's kookaburra on the outside
[1:17:56] it's sticky and everything else but on
[1:17:58] the inside it's wheat light so what
[1:18:00] actually bears out it's a mystery it's
[1:18:02] one of those things that you can look at
[1:18:04] in yourself you stir it still experience
[1:18:06] the cockle barrel you still experience
[1:18:09] dying daily you still experience having
[1:18:11] to repent and say lord forgive me for
[1:18:13] thinking that way or saying this what is
[1:18:16] it it is wheat life that is subduing
[1:18:19] cockerborough life
[1:18:22] what's happening wheat life is coming to
[1:18:24] pass
[1:18:26] and
[1:18:27] that war and battle will be
[1:18:31] until this wheat life has been fully
[1:18:34] developed
[1:18:35] but devil if you're listening it shall
[1:18:37] come to pass
[1:18:41] it shall come to pass
[1:18:44] even when i don't see it he's still
[1:18:46] working even when i don't feel it he's
[1:18:48] still working i am being changed by the
[1:18:52] spirit of almighty god
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:18:54] [Applause]
[1:18:57] oh glory be to god
[1:18:59] no wonder paul could write knowing your
[1:19:02] election
[1:19:03] beloved
[1:19:04] knowing your election that it's not by
[1:19:06] chance the holy ghost has not come to
[1:19:07] you by chance it's not by chance all i
[1:19:10] was i was born in the message raising
[1:19:11] the message now it may have been a while
[1:19:12] before you receive the revelation of
[1:19:15] jesus christ but it's not by chance
[1:19:18] you're not here tonight by chance i'm
[1:19:19] not here by chance this is ordained by
[1:19:22] god
[1:19:24] are you hearing me tonight now notice
[1:19:26] even peter would write brethren give
[1:19:27] diligence all carefulness to make your
[1:19:30] calling and election sure
[1:19:35] hallelujah
[1:19:36] see god working
[1:19:38] how is election known election itself is
[1:19:42] known by the one who elected in the
[1:19:45] beginning by christ himself coming
[1:19:47] through his word and you begin to
[1:19:49] recognize and see that the same god he
[1:19:52] knew me all along let me just say it's
[1:19:55] like this
[1:19:56] as it comes to me there was there was a
[1:19:58] boy
[1:20:00] a young man
[1:20:01] and he had been in a battle
[1:20:03] and he had come under a great shock
[1:20:06] here they were as war as war
[1:20:09] soldiers
[1:20:10] they were going to be taken away
[1:20:13] and put in a mental asylum because they
[1:20:15] were shocked in their mind and here
[1:20:19] they came to us place and there was a
[1:20:21] stop that was made at this rest area or
[1:20:24] place they could get out and stretch
[1:20:25] their legs
[1:20:28] and here come
[1:20:30] one boy out of there
[1:20:32] now the bus or the train whichever it
[1:20:34] was is filled
[1:20:37] but one of them steps off of that train
[1:20:39] or that bus
[1:20:41] and all of a sudden the man who's in
[1:20:43] charge of them starts noticing
[1:20:45] immediately
[1:20:49] there's a different glory there's a
[1:20:51] different look starts coming in that
[1:20:52] boy's eyes
[1:20:54] he starts looking around
[1:20:56] you know he's looking around
[1:20:58] no doubt if we could break into his mind
[1:21:01] this is a familiar place
[1:21:05] things things look familiar here
[1:21:08] now he was set in amnesia he was under a
[1:21:10] shock he didn't know who he
[1:21:12] was and they were going to send him to a
[1:21:15] mental asylum but right there in that
[1:21:17] moment here that sergeant began to watch
[1:21:19] this young man
[1:21:21] and that young man began to walk
[1:21:24] and that sergeant just thought he would
[1:21:25] watch him
[1:21:26] he walked over this hill there was a
[1:21:28] path on this hill so the sergeant kept
[1:21:30] following he walked over that path down
[1:21:32] that path walked up another one and then
[1:21:35] as they as he walked over that one he's
[1:21:37] down by the time the sergeant gets up to
[1:21:39] that second one and he's looking he sees
[1:21:41] a little cabin
[1:21:43] and on this little cabin
[1:21:45] there was setting a man
[1:21:48] and he said the more that boy kept
[1:21:50] walking
[1:21:55] everything around him became more
[1:21:58] familiar
[1:21:59] [Applause]
[1:22:00] that's where he was born at
[1:22:04] that's a place he belonged
[1:22:07] the bus and the train was trying to take
[1:22:09] him to other places
[1:22:12] i think it'd be a good time tonight to
[1:22:14] get off the bus
[1:22:15] get off the train
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:20] and that sergeant began to look and what
[1:22:23] he saw at about that time here came that
[1:22:26] old gentleman off the couch you know why
[1:22:28] that gentleman when he ran and he
[1:22:30] embraced his son he said son they told
[1:22:33] me you had died he said but i knew you'd
[1:22:36] come
[1:22:36] home it shall come to pass
[1:22:43] he came to himself
[1:22:46] his surroundings began to jolt away that
[1:22:49] amnesia
[1:22:50] what does that the presence of god
[1:22:53] begins to break away everything else
[1:22:55] around you and you begin walking and
[1:22:57] you're walking and you're walking what's
[1:22:59] happening you're on your way home
[1:23:02] [Music]

[1:23:28] in the world to satisfy scholarships and
[1:23:30] nothing wrong with scholarship nothing
[1:23:32] wrong with but he'll try to do
[1:23:33] everything he can to try to satisfy that
[1:23:36] thirst
[1:23:38] god put a thirst within you
[1:23:40] supernaturally that only he can satisfy
[1:23:43] him
[1:23:45] are you hearing me i'm gonna speak very
[1:23:46] plain this is why many times why people
[1:23:49] they try to search and satisfy their
[1:23:50] thirst with dating this one or mary and
[1:23:53] this one are doing this and this is why
[1:23:54] many times things end up because you
[1:23:56] know why they tried to satisfy that
[1:23:59] thirst in other ways and other means and
[1:24:02] god's the only one that can satisfy that
[1:24:04] thirst i tell you what i do i'd walk in
[1:24:06] obedience tonight and say lord i'm
[1:24:08] trying to figure i'm tired of figuring
[1:24:10] everything out because my mind has
[1:24:12] gotten me in trouble with everything so
[1:24:14] far i am not going to try to figure my
[1:24:16] way out of this i'm going to walk in
[1:24:18] obedience to your voice
[1:24:23] i'll tell you what you'll find you'll

[1:24:31] to where you will be above
[1:24:33] the world
[1:24:35] hallelujah
[1:24:37] let me just read this
[1:24:39] here tonight
[1:24:41] oh don't you love him
[1:24:43] in verse 13
[1:24:45] and the lord
[1:24:47] shall
[1:24:48] make thee
[1:24:52] the head
[1:24:55] in the summit the beginning and not
[1:24:58] the tale
[1:25:00] and thou shalt be what
[1:25:03] above
[1:25:04] only
[1:25:06] and thou shalt not
[1:25:08] be
[1:25:09] beneath
[1:25:11] if thou hearken unto the commandments of
[1:25:13] the lord thy god which i commanded thee
[1:25:15] this day to observe and to do them you
[1:25:18] know and you might say well brother
[1:25:19] samuel then i'll tell you we don't ever
[1:25:21] have to work we're always going to be
[1:25:22] above we we we are above by the spirit
[1:25:26] of god but remember if we walk in
[1:25:28] disobedience to his word
[1:25:30] then god will allow the enemy to come
[1:25:32] around
[1:25:35] is that right it isn't god isn't sitting
[1:25:36] back like a great grandfather you know
[1:25:38] and white beard and everything else all
[1:25:40] my children can't do nothing wrong no
[1:25:41] god will correct us if we're wrong
[1:25:43] right you know what that is that's his
[1:25:45] love so that we might remain in the
[1:25:47] position of divine authority
[1:25:52] brian give me this right here and thou
[1:25:54] shalt not go aside from any of the words
[1:25:56] which i command thee this day to the
[1:25:58] right hand or to the left to go after
[1:25:59] other gods to serve them you see it
[1:26:01] shows even in that of pressures and
[1:26:03] things that would come our way but god
[1:26:05] said you just stand in the midst of
[1:26:08] everything
[1:26:09] i will make thee to be the head and not
[1:26:12] the tail
[1:26:13] you know what's powerful
[1:26:15] is that sometimes you feel like you're
[1:26:17] the tail but you're actually the head
[1:26:22] see now we're not talking about worldly
[1:26:23] standards let me let me let me qualify
[1:26:25] that we're not talking about earthly
[1:26:26] standards you see this right here is not
[1:26:28] a comic book of superman
[1:26:30] this is not a comic book of batman or
[1:26:32] whatever more or incredible hawk or
[1:26:34] incredible lives or any that's not what
[1:26:36] this is
[1:26:37] okay so in other words oh my where
[1:26:40] everybody who's a superhero man he just
[1:26:43] grabs them by the head and beats them up
[1:26:44] jesus showed us that real victory
[1:26:47] is through yielding to the word
[1:26:50] he prefigured it there through samson
[1:26:52] samson killed a lot when the spirit of
[1:26:54] god that would come upon him but he
[1:26:56] killed more in his death when he
[1:26:58] surrendered to almighty god he killed
[1:27:02] more right there at that moment
[1:27:05] he showed us in the midst of it all it's
[1:27:07] incredible when you listen to the
[1:27:08] message how can overcome that just the
[1:27:10] amount of how brother branham lays in on
[1:27:12] the humility
[1:27:14] of how that christ himself he gave
[1:27:16] himself in humility think of what
[1:27:18] calvary brought for you and i it brought
[1:27:21] the greatest victory what was there in
[1:27:24] the garden of gethsemane when every
[1:27:27] demon out of hell and torment was there
[1:27:29] and that great conference was hid was
[1:27:32] held right there in the garden of
[1:27:33] gethsemane and he said nevertheless not
[1:27:36] my will thine will be done he prayed it
[1:27:39] three times
[1:27:42] now to the way the world looks at things
[1:27:45] they could look at that and say well
[1:27:47] that ain't a conqueror that's a wimp but
[1:27:49] you see god veils his power in humility
[1:27:56] because he was after a mark it was there
[1:27:58] to defeat the enemy he was there to pay
[1:28:01] the sin price and through that
[1:28:03] submission showing you and i now have
[1:28:06] been given a liberty to submit our will
[1:28:10] to the will of almighty god
[1:28:13] my goodness my goodness
[1:28:15] you see that's the working of the head
[1:28:18] in our life
[1:28:20] the real the real tale in our life
[1:28:23] is not the devil
[1:28:25] the tale
[1:28:26] is that old cockapoo part
[1:28:29] god said i will make thee who's the v
[1:28:32] he's talking about
[1:28:34] that of his
[1:28:35] seed
[1:28:36] that of his sons and daughters notice i
[1:28:39] will make thee
[1:28:41] it speaks of
[1:28:42] creation
[1:28:45] right
[1:28:46] you shall know
[1:28:47] the truth and the truth shall
[1:28:50] make you not set you
[1:28:53] make you free
[1:28:55] we are his workmanship ephesians 2
[1:28:58] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:29:03] we are a new
[1:29:05] creation
[1:29:06] not the old creation reformed it's a new
[1:29:11] creation
[1:29:12] in christ jesus and the lord shall
[1:29:14] make thee the head
[1:29:17] and not the tale
[1:29:19] by dwelling and being in him
[1:29:22] so all of this god was declaring
[1:29:25] the power of the word of god moving in
[1:29:28] the life
[1:29:29] of the believer
[1:29:30] it lifts you
[1:29:32] in authority
[1:29:35] it gives you dominion
[1:29:37] and may i say this to you tonight
[1:29:39] it puts you in charge
[1:29:43] now you might be sitting here tonight
[1:29:44] and you say you don't know what i have
[1:29:45] in my life but the word has put you in
[1:29:48] charge
[1:29:49] that devil can only stay there if you
[1:29:51] allow him to do it
[1:29:53] are you hearing me the word has put you
[1:29:55] in charge as a son and daughter of god

[1:30:02] you know you aren't going to become good
[1:30:04] enough you could never be good enough

[1:30:08] nothing even in thy mouth

[1:30:14] divine authority as a son and daughter
[1:30:17] of god not going to be we are now the
[1:30:20] sons and daughters of god

[1:30:28] repentance brings you it breaks the yoke
[1:30:31] of bondage upon your life
[1:30:34] what breaks the yoke
[1:30:36] the anointing
[1:30:39] is that right
[1:30:40] is that what isaiah had is that what
[1:30:42] isaiah had prophesied that the yoke of
[1:30:44] bondage the anointing shall break it
[1:30:46] what is the anointing it's the word
[1:30:49] it's christ himself coming to let you
[1:30:52] see that that yoke has already been
[1:30:55] conquered
[1:30:56] and you've got a right as a son and
[1:30:58] daughter of god to rise above whatever
[1:31:01] that bondage is you've got a right to
[1:31:03] throw it down and say i ain't no longer

[1:33:06] do that
[1:33:08] and let me tell you this promise right

[1:36:28] where i belong
[1:36:30] walking as a son and daughter of god
[1:36:32] and looking around and i think how
[1:36:34] brother brown says at the one time he
[1:36:36] says that young man as he was walking
[1:36:38] over them hills he said he began to see
[1:36:39] a water tower in an incredible a water
[1:36:42] tower
[1:36:42] he begins to see these different
[1:36:44] landmarks and he recognizes
[1:36:47] this is home
[1:36:50] you see what the word of god as it comes
[1:36:52] to you all it asks you to walk in the
[1:36:54] light as he's in the light
[1:36:57] and we have fellowship one with another
[1:37:00] and the blood of jesus christ your son
[1:37:02] cleanses us from all unrighteousness
[1:37:04] there's an authority in your life that
[1:37:07] god has placed there let me tell you
[1:37:08] something this this message tonight did
[1:37:10] not place that authority in your life
[1:37:12] are you hearing me what's been spoken
[1:37:14] tonight the all it does is it awakens
[1:37:17] the authority that god's already placed
[1:37:19] there
[1:37:20] and when you can recognize that you
[1:37:22] could say death will get behind me
[1:37:25] therefore you don't have no right here
[1:37:27] that's why you can pray when you're
[1:37:29] asking for the holy ghost you're seeking
[1:37:31] remember you can realize it's not
[1:37:33] something of a perhaps something of a
[1:37:35] maybe you're standing in a place where
[1:37:37] you belong prayer is changing from a
[1:37:40] maybe soul to this is my promise
[1:37:44] when sickness arise prayer is different
[1:37:47] you're standing there with a promise
[1:37:49] by his stripes i am healed
[1:37:53] prayer has changed brother dave
[1:37:56] because we're aware
[1:37:57] we belong
[1:37:58] glory
[1:38:00] glory be to god don't feel good to be
[1:38:01] home
[1:38:02] hallelujah it feels good to be home
[1:38:05] oh man i love to be home
[1:38:07] i love to be home no other place i'd
[1:38:09] rather preach minister there ain't no
[1:38:10] other bed i'd rather sleep in there
[1:38:12] ain't another room there ain't no other
[1:38:13] pillows ain't nothing hey nothing to me
[1:38:15] like being home
[1:38:17] right and nothing like it when you know
[1:38:19] you're home and to think about it this
[1:38:21] world itself is not my home
[1:38:26] are you with me the reason that this guy
[1:38:28] feels at home here is because this is
[1:38:30] where god's ordained me to be
[1:38:32] to serve his purpose
[1:38:35] but but there's a greater there's a
[1:38:37] greater place that i'm dwelling a
[1:38:39] greater place than i'm receiving direct
[1:38:41] communication from and that is our
[1:38:43] conversation is from heaven i am
[1:38:46] receiving direct communication from the
[1:38:49] word of god this is my constitution
[1:38:51] and this constitution has declared
[1:38:53] freedom
[1:38:55] are you hearing me
[1:38:56] four horse riders of death tried to
[1:38:58] bring in bondage but there has been a
[1:39:00] ministry of jesus christ that has come
[1:39:03] to declare liberty and restore every
[1:39:06] promise that god had made in the book
[1:39:09] you talking about a declaration of
[1:39:11] independence
[1:39:12] this is our liberty
[1:39:16] oh when prayer changes
[1:39:19] when prayer changes don't you love him
[1:39:22] glory be to god so we're not approaching
[1:39:24] him as a pauper we're not we're
[1:39:26] approaching god with an assurance in our
[1:39:28] life
[1:39:29] whatever that need is remember you are a
[1:39:32] son and daughter of god
[1:39:33] whatever promise it is
[1:39:35] you claim that promise right now
[1:39:38] whatever it is healing
[1:39:40] job whatever remember all these we read
[1:39:42] in deuteronomy 28 god said these
[1:39:44] blessings will overtake you
[1:39:46] they're spiritual blessings to us in
[1:39:49] christ jesus
[1:39:54] let's stand
[1:39:57] glory be to god in the highest
[1:39:59] yeah
[1:40:02] i'll tell you i tell you how i feel
[1:40:05] i want him to continue to overtake me
[1:40:09] i want him to continue to overtake me
[1:40:11] until eventually he had been so
[1:40:13] overtaken like enoch i'm no longer here
[1:40:16] i'm there
[1:40:18] i want that word to so overtake in my
[1:40:20] life i want everything to be so lined up
[1:40:22] with him he the blessing has come upon
[1:40:24] me there's been an overtaking brother
[1:40:26] shane by the new birth but now that
[1:40:28] overtaking you know what it is it's a
[1:40:30] molding it's a shaping it's an active
[1:40:32] working of the holy ghost in our life to
[1:40:35] one of these moments brother carlos

[1:40:38] a drinking of an eye

[1:42:02] poured out upon zion her walls have been
[1:42:05] built up again the word has returned and

[1:42:11] we have been created to praise the lord
[1:42:14] [Music]
[1:42:16] glory be to god let me tell you
[1:42:18] something this same working of the
[1:42:19] blessing of abraham ruth that's working
[1:42:21] through your life that has brought forth
[1:42:23] jesus christ what will it do it'll be
[1:42:25] handed back to naomi
[1:42:29] it will be handed back to naomi this
[1:42:31] same gospel of jesus christ will be
[1:42:34] handed back to naomi it will be handed
[1:42:37] back to the jews
[1:42:40] glory be to god and those two witnesses
[1:42:41] will stand there with the anointing and
[1:42:43] authority of god and they will open that
[1:42:45] sick seal and declare the coming of the
[1:42:48] lord to those jews
[1:42:51] what a time we're living in
[1:42:54] what a time the favor
[1:42:57] of god has been poured out upon you
[1:43:00] you know what the favor of god is and
[1:43:02] ain't anything you can merit it's not
[1:43:04] what i merit but the favor of god
[1:43:06] is his presence that has come
[1:43:08] to let you know
[1:43:10] this is who you are
[1:43:12] you belong to me
[1:43:14] you were always mine
[1:43:16] i always knew you
[1:43:19] you were you were in my mind all along
[1:43:21] when when i when i spoke my word because
[1:43:24] you are a part of that word you were a
[1:43:26] part of me i spoke your name in here
[1:43:30] now you might look and you may not find
[1:43:32] your name as far as written out by an
[1:43:34] earthly name but that ain't the name
[1:43:36] you're known in earth by that name like
[1:43:39] you're known as paul in the earth i'm
[1:43:40] known as samuel but you see our name was
[1:43:43] included by divine inspiration by the
[1:43:47] word that would be given in this hour
[1:43:49] and what the word does when it sounds
[1:43:51] out
[1:43:52] it calls your name
[1:43:54] it's just something that resonates in
[1:43:56] your heart and you say that's me
[1:43:59] if you're like me i was raised in this
[1:44:01] message all my life born
[1:44:03] i never knew nothing else
[1:44:05] but you know what
[1:44:07] i had to meet him
[1:44:10] i had to meet him
[1:44:12] i had to meet him predestinated oh yes
[1:44:15] i'm certain of that i believe that by
[1:44:17] the grace of god but you know what that
[1:44:19] is it just shows there's that pathway
[1:44:21] that god came seeking for me
[1:44:25] not me
[1:44:27] seeking for him
[1:44:29] a person could say oh i saw god i sought
[1:44:31] god no the only reason you had a desire
[1:44:32] for god because god put that in you
[1:44:39] think of the victory of the desire of
[1:44:41] the word in your life
[1:44:44] that even of all of the world and all of
[1:44:47] the pleasures of the world
[1:44:49] could not silence
[1:44:51] the voice
[1:44:53] of god's desire in your life
[1:44:56] you talk about victory
[1:44:58] you talk about victory but what about
[1:45:00] now
[1:45:01] when victory has come
[1:45:03] to lift you
[1:45:05] in victory
