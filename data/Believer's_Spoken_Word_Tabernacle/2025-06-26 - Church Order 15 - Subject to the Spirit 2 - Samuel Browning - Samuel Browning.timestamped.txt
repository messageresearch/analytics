[30:51] And oh shout to the Lord all the earth.
[30:57] Let us sing.
[31:00] Oh power and majesty.
[31:05] Praise to the king. Let's all sing. The
[31:09] mountains bow down and the seas
[31:15] do roar at the sound
[31:20] of your name.
[31:24] I sing and I'll sing for joy at the
[31:29] works of your hands. Oh Lord, forever
[31:35] I'll love you, God. Forever
[31:39] I'll stand. I know that nothing compares
[31:45] to this song. Oh, hallelujah.
[31:49] Oh, with you.
[31:53] Let's just worship the Lord just a
[31:54] little bit. Oh yes, Lord. My Jesus.
[32:00] My Jesus,
[32:04] my savior.
[32:08] Lord, there is none like you.
[32:14] All of my days,
[32:18] Lord, I want to praise
[32:22] the wonders of your mouth,
[32:26] of your mighty precious love.
[32:30] Oh, he's my comforter.
[32:33] Oh, my coner.
[32:37] Oh, he's my shelter.
[32:41] The tower of reuge
[32:44] and strength.
[32:47] So let every breath
[32:51] all that I am.
[32:55] Oh never cease to worship.
[32:59] Never cease to worship you.
[33:03] I want to shout to the Lord. Shout to my
[33:07] Lord all the earth. Let all his bride
[33:13] sing.
[33:17] Yes, Lord. Praise to you, my king.
[33:20] Mountains bow down.
[33:24] Oh, and the seas say,
[33:28] "Oh, at the sound
[33:32] of your mighty, precious, wonderful
[33:37] name." And I sing for joy at the work of
[33:43] your hands. Oh Lord, forever
[33:47] I'll love you, Lord. Forever I'll sing.
[33:53] I know that nothing compares to this
[33:58] promise
[34:00] I have
[34:02] in you.
[34:05] Lift over and shout to the Lord. All the
[34:11] earth let us sing.
[34:16] Power and majesty
[34:19] praise to my king and your mountains bow
[34:25] down and the seas
[34:29] do roar at the sound
[34:35] of Lord. Oh, your mighty holy name. And
[34:41] I'll sing for joy. Hallelujah.
[34:45] At the words of your
[34:48] forever.
[34:50] I will love you forever. I say I know
[34:56] that nothing compares to the promise
[35:02] I have. Oh, I know that nothing compares
[35:08] to the promise
[35:10] I have. I know that nothing
[35:14] nothing compares to this proise
[35:19] I have
[35:21] in you. Yes, Lord Jesus.
[35:27] Praise the Lord.
[35:29] Praise the Lord. Oh, he's worthy.
[35:32] He's worthy tonight.
[35:36] Amen.
[35:39] Hallelujah.
[35:40] It's so good to be gathered together.
[35:43] So thankful for the grace of God and
[35:46] giving us strength to be here and um
[35:51] just want to remember um these requests
[35:55] um sister Miranda had mentioned that or
[36:00] was brought to our attention and that's
[36:03] uh it's been out there on the prayer
[36:05] thread um for the past couple days on
[36:09] regarding her son Marco. he had a heart
[36:12] attack and um so they they did stints,
[36:16] they put a couple stints in, but the
[36:18] extent of it right now is that they were
[36:22] at that point of deciding do they need
[36:24] to put more stances in or do an open
[36:27] heart surgery. And so they came to that
[36:30] decision to do an open heart surgery. So
[36:34] um we just want to continue to keep him
[36:36] in prayer. And uh I know also sister Ann
[36:39] Hannah was speaking with her and you
[36:41] know it's a lot for a mother. You always
[36:44] a mother. I was reminding her of how
[36:46] when the Lord grounded that plane in
[36:48] Memphis and how that uh that brother Ram
[36:52] said that auntie she she was praying and
[36:55] he said uh he said it was still mama's
[36:58] boy no matter the condition he was in.
[37:00] And uh you know my heart's desire as I
[37:04] spoke to sister Anna I said you know I
[37:07] know that that Marco's been very
[37:09] respectful in different things and I've
[37:11] I've come in contact with him multiple
[37:13] times in situations but I said we just
[37:16] pray that God not only God's in control
[37:20] but that God would would also not only
[37:22] direct the doctors but God would bring
[37:24] him to a place to really yield to what
[37:28] he knows is truth. Yes. Amen. Because
[37:31] you know, we we know we can we can be
[37:33] around and know what's truth, but it's
[37:36] when you yield to it. Amen. Amen. And
[37:38] may God just move also spiritually upon
[37:40] his heart. Amen. And just bring a real a
[37:43] real yielding there as well. So, we want
[37:45] to remember that in prayer and that the
[37:47] Lord would be with them and the family
[37:50] uh through that. Just give them just a
[37:52] real peace and a and a comfort as well
[37:54] through that. Um, also I had just on my
[37:58] heart before coming out just grab
[38:00] another prayer cloth for uh, Sister
[38:02] Maria here tonight. And so we minister
[38:05] with these, but I would like for us to
[38:07] join together in prayer and just to
[38:10] approach the Lord on behalf of these
[38:12] needs. And you also tonight, Brother
[38:16] Dave Senior, he's not here. And brother
[38:18] Dave, he's, you know, for it's been
[38:20] about a month now, and I've prayed with
[38:23] him on the phone and things, but he's
[38:25] been dealing with a real pain in his
[38:27] shoulder. And it's just been, it's just
[38:30] been almost unbearable. And, you know,
[38:32] different ones are dealing with pain and
[38:34] things like that. And I was in here
[38:37] earlier today and I just I just laid my
[38:39] hands right upon where both of them sat.
[38:41] I didn't know that if they'd be here
[38:42] tonight or not. But I believe the the
[38:44] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[38:46] avaleth much. And I believe that's for
[38:48] every child of God. Amen. So, let's just
[38:50] these are needs in the body and uh it's
[38:53] an opportunity for God to move. And
[38:55] let's just take these requests. No doubt
[38:57] there's many unspoken requests. There's
[38:59] needs you have on your heart and there's
[39:01] nothing that's too difficult for God.
[39:04] Amen. Nothing that's impossible. Amen.
[39:07] Let's just approach him in prayer.
[39:09] Heavenly Father,
[39:11] Lord, we are standing here Lord by the
[39:15] grace of God as believers father. Oh
[39:19] God, believers in Lord this great end
[39:22] time message Lord that Father has
[39:25] revealed
[39:27] Lord you to us Lord has brought Lord a
[39:30] liberty Lord has brought reality Lord
[39:34] raising you up out of history.
[39:36] Oh, Father, we're so thankful, Lord,
[39:39] that you have restored and given your
[39:42] name, Lord, back to the church of the
[39:45] living God. So, we come, Lord, as you
[39:48] said in your word, ask the father,
[39:50] anything in my name, and I will do it.
[39:53] And you said, Lord, father, if two or
[39:56] three agree is touching any one thing,
[39:58] it shall be done. Now, Father, we're
[40:01] yielding our faith together, Lord, one
[40:04] with another as brothers and sisters, as
[40:07] fellow soldiers, Lord, there's those,
[40:10] Lord, among us, Lord, there are needs,
[40:13] Lord, that Father, that God, they need a
[40:16] divine touch from the great physician,
[40:19] Lord. And Father, we certainly believe,
[40:23] Lord, that you're no respector of
[40:25] persons. And Lord, distance means
[40:28] nothing to you, Lord. So Lord, we just
[40:31] ask Lord that the Holy Spirit, the
[40:34] enforcer of the word, Lord, would go,
[40:37] Father, Lord, to serve notice upon the
[40:39] enemy, Lord, tonight. And dear God, may
[40:42] you move, I pray, back every cloud,
[40:45] Lord, of of discomfort, of pain, Lord.
[40:48] And may you bring healing, Lord, as we
[40:50] mention here tonight, Lord, not only in
[40:52] the physical realm, but spiritually as
[40:54] well, Lord, for you care, Father. You're
[40:58] mindful of every need, Lord. Now, Lord,
[41:00] we commit this, Lord, into your hands,
[41:03] Lord. But Lord, we're your children and
[41:06] healing is the children's bread. Lord,
[41:09] we ask this right now, Father, for your
[41:12] glory, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[41:16] And Lord, we ask that you would just
[41:17] guide us as we Lord turn our hearts to
[41:20] look into the word. Speak to our hearts,
[41:23] Lord. My heart included, Lord. We desire
[41:27] to hear from you, Father. In the name of
[41:30] Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[41:35] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Thank
[41:38] you, musicians. Amen. And if we could,
[41:40] let's let's turn in the scriptures here.
[41:43] And I would like to read a few verses of
[41:45] scripture before we let you be seated.
[41:48] And uh
[41:54] want to remind you this, Lord willing,
[41:55] we're going to try to at least this
[41:57] coming Sunday and to try to do the the
[41:59] fireside fellowship after
[42:02] um later there in the evening on Sunday
[42:05] and just to try to have that little
[42:07] little time that we have there. And I'm
[42:10] thankful, boy, I'm thankful we didn't
[42:12] have it on Sunday.
[42:15] We wouldn't needed fire,
[42:19] but uh we'll have it a little later in
[42:21] the in the evening when it would kind of
[42:23] cool down. And I'm I'm usually here of
[42:25] an evening anyhow. And I know how
[42:27] throughout the day and how the sun kind
[42:28] of really kind of is blocked back there
[42:31] about the time. And but my goodness, I'm
[42:33] thankful for the grace of God that seen
[42:35] us through those days. And uh I was
[42:38] texting back and forth that um brother
[42:41] Homer, he was just um just texting me
[42:44] here and just letting me know the
[42:45] meetings went well. And and so I said,
[42:48] "Man, did you bring the heat from
[42:49] Alabama up here?"
[42:51] Uh but uh he said, "No, we actually had
[42:55] 70s." And he said, "But now we're
[42:56] getting it." And you know, we're in the
[42:58] south. But uh so anyhow, God is good.
[43:01] Amen. Sometimes in things like that, it
[43:03] just makes you appreciate Amen. and
[43:05] being able to have, you know, air
[43:06] condition and things like that. So, um,
[43:09] let's look here in the scriptures and I
[43:11] just want to read a few places. I want
[43:13] to go from here and then we'll go into
[43:14] another place and then we'll let you be
[43:16] seated. In 1 Corinthians 14:32,
[43:19] the Bible says that the spirits of the
[43:22] prophets are subject to the prophets.
[43:26] So, we understand that's the spirit of
[43:28] God working will always be subject to
[43:31] the word of God or the order. And then
[43:34] in 1 Timothy chapter 3, I want to pull
[43:38] up here in 1 Timothy 3 in verse uh 14
[43:45] and look here at this. And I want to say
[43:47] I thank God for the the ministry that
[43:50] God has allowed us to uh be able to come
[43:52] in here. We so have enjoyed the the
[43:54] ministering of the word and I really
[43:56] appreciated uh brother Rap here on
[43:58] Sunday. Amen. I really enjoyed that and
[44:02] just so much.
[44:04] And uh so 1 Timothy 3:14, "These things
[44:08] write I unto you, hoping to come unto
[44:10] thee shortly. But if I tar long, that
[44:13] thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
[44:16] behave thyself in the house of God,
[44:19] which is the church of the living God,
[44:21] the pillar and ground of the truth, and
[44:25] without controversy. Great is the
[44:27] mystery of godliness. God was manifested
[44:30] in the flesh, justified in the spirit,
[44:34] seen of angels, preached unto the
[44:36] Gentiles, believed on in the world, and
[44:39] received up into glory. Amen. May God
[44:43] bless you and bless the reading of the
[44:44] word as you're being seated. Uh I want
[44:46] to take just another part here on this
[44:49] on uh subject to the spirit and um
[44:53] really dealing here tonight or and try
[44:57] to um wrap it up Lord willing by next
[45:00] week here with the part in dealing with
[45:03] uh in terms of when we look at
[45:05] correction and I sometimes that word uh
[45:07] can seem to be kind of um stinging but
[45:10] yet correction itself comes in so many
[45:12] different forms in so many ways And so
[45:16] that's the thing I also want to be able
[45:17] to look at here tonight that God uh God
[45:20] is not always in the business nor does
[45:22] he delight in always to where that
[45:25] correction itself would have to be a
[45:27] measure of judgment. But God delights on
[45:30] even to where we come to a place to be
[45:33] able to recognize his voice and then
[45:36] respond to that and there becomes a
[45:37] correction in our life. That's the whole
[45:40] the whole objective and how that even
[45:42] while the word is being preached. Uh
[45:45] there's things sometimes that the Holy
[45:46] Spirit will say so directly and then
[45:49] there's other times where the Lord will
[45:51] just be in the midst of the service and
[45:53] just as the word is coming forth there's
[45:56] things that will begin to drop and sink
[45:58] in and in our in our lives and we're
[46:00] just surrendering and submitting to that
[46:02] and that's all a work of the Holy
[46:04] Spirit. There's things at times where I
[46:06] know that I've prayed with different
[46:08] ones or received an email or text or
[46:10] whatever. And the very thing of how God
[46:12] has so personally dealt with maybe
[46:14] something within their life and they're
[46:16] just giving God thanks for that. It may
[46:18] not have even been anything that was
[46:20] said word for word, but in the presence
[46:22] of the word himself, my there's a so
[46:26] many things that can take place. And
[46:28] that's where understanding comes into
[46:29] our life because this is an hour of
[46:32] applying. It's a time that we're not
[46:34] this this you know the rapture is not
[46:37] for um that of a bank of knowledge to be
[46:40] mil to be built and lifted off but it's
[46:43] a time of the word being applied to our
[46:45] lives and God guides us and in such a
[46:48] way to be able to show and apply that
[46:50] word to our lives. And so here when we
[46:54] look at here in in the the scriptures
[46:56] back here in that uh verse we started
[46:59] with in 1 Corinthians 14:32. And I I
[47:02] want to say this that when we read here
[47:06] uh I've made this point many times but
[47:08] you can see in in the book of
[47:10] Corinthians if there had not been a
[47:13] struggle within this church dealing with
[47:16] the gifts we would not know the order.
[47:21] We wouldn't. So the reality is is that
[47:25] we what we read in first Corinthians and
[47:27] then you read over in 2 Corinthians.
[47:29] When you read in 2 Corinthians you hear
[47:31] no mention about the gifts and you're
[47:33] still doing this or still doing that
[47:35] because there was a correction that came
[47:38] but more importantly they themselves
[47:40] received that correction. And second
[47:43] Corinthians is the evident fruit of
[47:45] that. And so those are things that yet
[47:47] within every other letter, Ephesians,
[47:50] Galatians, on and on, you find that
[47:52] there in every church and that not only
[47:54] in every church in the writing, but
[47:56] every church that that even is among us,
[47:58] there's strengths and there's weaknesses
[48:00] and God knows the strengths and
[48:02] weaknesses. Sometimes we can only look
[48:04] at something on the outside and my
[48:06] everything is just so so wonderful and
[48:09] so this and that and you know but you
[48:12] get around a little bit and you realize
[48:13] hey everybody's human still and there's
[48:16] things of humanity that's there and you
[48:18] know and and it's like I've you hear it
[48:19] said and someone says I'm looking for
[48:21] the perfect church and you say well
[48:22] don't go there because you'll mess it
[48:23] up. So you realize that there's no
[48:26] perfect church but there is a perfect
[48:28] body and that's the body of Jesus
[48:30] Christ. And it's amazing how that God,
[48:33] you know, he doesn't have to uh come
[48:35] down and correct the trees and correct
[48:38] all the things of of that of of his
[48:40] creation. He doesn't have to correct the
[48:42] stars. But brother Bram says, "Oh, how
[48:44] that he has to work with us as human
[48:46] beings. But I'm glad he's willing to
[48:48] work with us. I'm glad that God is
[48:50] long-suffering. I'm glad that God for me
[48:52] on my life and on your life. I'm glad I
[48:55] could say personally that God never
[48:56] threw in the towel because I can look
[48:58] back on a lot of things and say, "My
[49:00] Lord, you've brought me a mighty long
[49:02] way." And when I look and see how far
[49:04] that he's brought me, it makes me know
[49:06] I've got a long way to go. It's because
[49:08] back then sometimes you're not even
[49:10] aware of certain things, but God in his
[49:12] grace is right there. Like brother
[49:14] Trevor preached, God didn't just send us
[49:16] out, but God's right there with us the
[49:18] whole time. And I'm so thankful that God
[49:20] is a faithful guide in every part of our
[49:23] life. And so when we look at this this
[49:25] element here that the spirits of the
[49:28] prophets are subject to the prophets uh
[49:30] the prophet you know he'll continue to
[49:32] use this scripture uh even in regards to
[49:36] even among you know the Pentecostals and
[49:38] those that were he was he was teaching
[49:40] and working with there in the in in the
[49:43] Brham tabernacle as well as around the
[49:45] world. There was quotes from all all
[49:48] services not just Brandham tabernacle
[49:50] because this is the prophet to the age.
[49:53] And so things that were mentioned in
[49:55] that time that undoubtedly it was a
[49:58] struggle sometimes for individuals we
[50:00] know it was for people to come to it
[50:03] even to the real baptism of the Holy
[50:07] Ghost. It was a struggle moving away
[50:09] from looking at uh evidences and coming
[50:13] to a place to recognize that it's not
[50:16] demonstrations you look for. It's the
[50:18] action of the person of Christ on the
[50:21] inside quickened to every word of God.
[50:24] And so the prophet had that I'm quoting
[50:26] that was a quote directly from Satan's
[50:28] Eden in 1965 where someone even says and
[50:31] brother Brandham rehearses it and says
[50:33] why isn't brother Brandham preaching on
[50:34] the Holy Ghost and brother Brandham just
[50:36] stops and says exactly what I just said.
[50:38] And you think to me, I've always looked
[50:40] at that point in the message and
[50:42] thought, who could ever sit and listen
[50:44] to the message and accuse Brother
[50:46] Brandham of not preaching on the Holy
[50:47] Ghost? But you see what it was? It was a
[50:50] lack of understanding of what the Holy
[50:52] Ghost was. That's why, as the prophet
[50:55] says, we can't take our denominational
[50:58] ideas and then try to mix them with this
[51:00] message. It's got to pass away. And the
[51:03] reality of it is this is just things
[51:05] that that myself that I've I've
[51:07] witnessed to over the years that
[51:08] sometimes there's things that we can
[51:10] accumulate that no one ever taught us.
[51:12] It's things that we've accumulated on
[51:14] our own. And yet when we can recognize
[51:17] and God by his grace, you know, God
[51:19] doesn't take anything out of our hands.
[51:21] But I'll tell you this, if anything God
[51:23] has given us, you can lay it down on the
[51:25] pew and you'll be able to take it back
[51:27] up when you walk out of here tonight.
[51:29] But if anything that is not of God, I
[51:31] don't want to take it back because it's
[51:33] actually not a help, not a benefit, not
[51:35] an edification, it's actually a
[51:37] hindrance. And so these are things that
[51:40] with teaching, not only in this
[51:42] scripture that you don't interrupt that
[51:45] that when a minister is speaking and
[51:47] someone standing up and speaking in
[51:48] tongues or the altar call is going on or
[51:51] it there there's a divine order that God
[51:53] has given and that's what the prophet
[51:55] set out through all of this. There is an
[51:59] order and we want to find that order. We
[52:01] want to operate in that order. That's
[52:03] where we want to move in because that's
[52:05] the blessing of God. And I want to just
[52:08] drop this in to you and perhaps we'll
[52:10] pick it up next week, but to understand
[52:12] that the church of the living God is not
[52:15] is not a lifeless being, but it's a
[52:18] living organism. Right. And meaning
[52:20] within that there are there are times
[52:23] where changes become necessary according
[52:27] to the conditions. And so this is
[52:29] exactly even when the prophet dealt with
[52:32] those that were starting out with gifts
[52:33] and then there was a change that was
[52:35] made later on and then even as he would
[52:38] revisit things and have them revisit
[52:40] things within the tabernacle from time
[52:42] to time. And I'm glad that God does that
[52:45] for each of our lives. As Peter said, as
[52:48] long as I'm here, I'm going to stir up
[52:50] your pure mind by way of remembrance. Is
[52:52] that right? So, so within this, when we
[52:55] look here at this very term of subject,
[52:58] this word itself uh is is a word that is
[53:02] not where someone is being made to do
[53:06] something. That that's not it at all.
[53:08] But it's the word that is used that
[53:11] means to subject oneself or to obey or
[53:15] to submit to one's control to yield to
[53:19] one's admonition or advice or to obey.
[53:21] You know, frankly, it is is that the
[53:24] prophet tells us God doesn't make
[53:26] anybody serve him.
[53:29] And that's that's even, you know, it's
[53:31] not it's a choice that is set before us.
[53:35] And this is even where predestination
[53:38] displays itself because when the light
[53:41] flashes across our path there, if
[53:44] there's something on the inside and and
[53:47] you know what, sometimes you got to give
[53:48] it time. Don't just make a judgment
[53:50] because well, they've been exposed to
[53:52] the light. Just give it time because if
[53:54] there is a seed that is there that's
[53:56] ordained to eternal life, they you you
[54:00] can they will not fail to come to
[54:02] eternal life. they will come to that
[54:05] because that is a part of God's word.
[54:08] And sometimes it takes such a time just
[54:11] sitting in the presence of God to melt
[54:14] away all of self and dissolve all of
[54:17] that. And you know what? I'm so glad
[54:19] that the spirit of God staying in his
[54:21] presence is there to melt away all of
[54:24] self. And I'll tell you this, the
[54:26] prophet says it very clearly when he
[54:28] when he says this in the message
[54:30] ashamed. And he talked about those who
[54:32] went out in Arizona, you know, and they
[54:34] really they weren't going to church. And
[54:35] brother Bram says, "What happens is when
[54:37] you stay out of the prince of God, you
[54:40] become sticky like these cactuses. But
[54:43] in order to stay fresh, in order to stay
[54:47] in a place of being moldable and yielded
[54:50] to God, you got to stay in God's
[54:51] presence." Now, let me just say this to
[54:53] you. You can read and not be in God's
[54:56] presence.
[54:57] You can pray and not be in God's
[54:59] presence. It matters how you come out of
[55:03] there. Let me give you an example. The
[55:04] prophet tells us that when someone has
[55:07] done you wrong. And he says, "But when
[55:09] you can get before the throne of God and
[55:12] then put yourself in that man's shoes,
[55:14] the only way you can do that is get in
[55:16] God's presence."
[55:19] And when you come back out, the prophet
[55:20] said, "When you come back out, you'll
[55:22] come back out thinking differently."
[55:24] Listen there. Listen, it's more you
[55:26] realize the presence of God is not
[55:28] religious duty. It's an atmosphere. It's
[55:31] coming into into that of of the very
[55:34] person of the word himself. And it
[55:36] changes your life. How many know what it
[55:38] is when you get in God's presence? And
[55:40] there can be all sorts of things on your
[55:42] mind and pressures and and you get into
[55:44] God's presence and even the things that
[55:47] would seem to be pressure or anxious
[55:50] about you get in his presence and for
[55:52] some reason those don't even have the
[55:54] same significance that they had before.
[55:57] What brought that about? Not not our
[56:00] humanness. His presence.
[56:03] It's his presence that can take a dry
[56:06] stick like Aaron's rod and cause it to
[56:09] blossom to bloom and produce fruit
[56:12] within just that period of time. What
[56:15] made the difference where it was at? So
[56:17] that's why God, we don't want to just go
[56:19] through religious motions because and
[56:21] you know and then read and pray. All of
[56:24] those things are are are good, but Lord,
[56:26] I want to come into your presence.
[56:28] That's why the prophet said, "You take
[56:29] the Bible, Lord, speak to me, Lord. I
[56:32] want to come into your presence because
[56:33] I just don't want to go through the
[56:35] motions and come out with the same
[56:36] attitude. I want to just give it to you,
[56:39] Lord. What a privilege it is to be able
[56:41] to cast our cares upon him for he cares
[56:44] for us. So to be able to to submit or to
[56:48] yield to one's control and that's a
[56:50] choice. That's a choice. We are seeing
[56:53] the result in this hour of the way that
[56:56] the church and everything has gone. And
[56:58] you know what? It was a choice. the
[57:00] message had been presented before the
[57:02] way that even the Pentecostals have
[57:04] gone. The way it's all a choice. God
[57:07] never made them do that. That's a choice
[57:09] they made not to yield to the word of
[57:11] God. And it was properly vindicated
[57:15] before them.
[57:17] So this word subject, it's not something
[57:19] of you're going to do this. It's it's
[57:21] voluntary. It's a word that means to
[57:25] arrange in a military fashion under the
[57:28] command of a leader. It's a voluntary
[57:30] attitude. A voluntary attitude of giving
[57:32] in or cooperating, assuming
[57:35] responsibility and carrying a burden. I
[57:38] would say that last part, a voluntary
[57:40] attitude, it totally sums up what God's
[57:43] desire is for a real submissive heart.
[57:47] It's not something that God has to look
[57:49] upon our lives and, you know, he's he's
[57:51] barreling down on us with angry eyes. If
[57:54] you don't do this, I'm going to zap you
[57:56] out of here. That's not love. Amen.
[57:59] Brother Bram says, "I wouldn't marry
[58:00] anyone that I you had to do that to. You
[58:02] can't trust them."
[58:05] God's not interested. It's a
[58:06] relationship.
[58:08] It's divine love. It's a voluntary
[58:11] attitude, not something that is is
[58:13] mandated, not something that you know
[58:16] God is just just demanding. God dem God
[58:19] demands reverence to his word, but he
[58:21] can't make you or I reverence his word.
[58:23] But when he sends his word forth, the
[58:26] children of God rise under the light of
[58:29] God in this hour. And what do they
[58:31] become? They become the expression of
[58:34] that word. What is it? a part that part
[58:37] of the wife that they're to play of the
[58:39] body of Jesus Christ.
[58:41] Yes. Just like putting, you know, liver
[58:44] cells into a body, it don't go to the
[58:46] foot, it goes to the liver.
[58:48] You put kidney cells in, it goes to the
[58:50] kidney. Who who directs it? We're
[58:52] intelligence. God even in the natural
[58:55] body was showing how the spiritual body
[58:57] is made up.
[59:00] Recognizing Christ in this hour, it's a
[59:02] voluntary attitude. cooperating,
[59:04] assuming responsibility and carrying a
[59:07] burden. Now, look how that the prophet
[59:10] when he would would bring this forth and
[59:13] he says it like this. The Holy Spirit
[59:15] will always the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[59:18] word of God and it'll recognize the word
[59:21] and be reverent.
[59:26] That's what the Holy Spirit will do.
[59:29] Now, notice, let's look at a few
[59:31] scriptures here. Peter writes this.
[59:34] Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves,
[59:37] this is the same word, submit,
[59:38] yourselves unto the elder. Yay, all of
[59:41] you be subject one to another, and be
[59:44] clothed with humility. For God resisteth
[59:47] the proud, and giveth grace to the
[59:50] humble. So, we're here to serve one
[59:54] another. Right? Is that right? So, here
[59:57] it's a it's cooperating. Remember that
[59:59] voluntary attitude. It's all it's all
[1:00:01] working together for one purpose. No big
[1:00:04] eyes, no little use. There's one
[1:00:06] objective we have and that's to see
[1:00:08] Jesus Christ and him glorified. That's
[1:00:11] one there's that that objective.
[1:00:13] Anything outside of that, we we're we're
[1:00:15] off the mark.
[1:00:17] So to unto that that submission. Now
[1:00:20] notice how Peter or or Paul would write
[1:00:23] this to Titus. And I want you to I want
[1:00:25] to I want you to think of this. Here is
[1:00:27] a servant of God writing to that to
[1:00:31] those men of God that they would put the
[1:00:34] church of the living God in remembrance
[1:00:36] of these things. Put them in mind to be
[1:00:38] subject to principalities and powers and
[1:00:41] to obey magistrates and to be ready to
[1:00:44] every good work to speak evil of no man.
[1:00:50] And the church said to be no brawlers
[1:00:54] but gentle showing all meekness unto all
[1:00:58] men. So this scripture is not confined
[1:01:03] to just having the right behavior among
[1:01:06] people who are in these four walls.
[1:01:10] But it is to all men. It's an example.
[1:01:14] It's not something that's just put on
[1:01:16] that you know you know here around the
[1:01:18] right people. we're we act a certain way
[1:01:20] but in other situations we're testy and
[1:01:22] contestive and combat. No, no. This this
[1:01:25] is where the put put them in mind. So
[1:01:27] now when this is spoken here, you you
[1:01:30] think that you think that there weren't
[1:01:32] magistrates or situations of things that
[1:01:35] was easy to submit to there. No doubt
[1:01:37] among believers just like you and I have
[1:01:40] had bosses has have other people that we
[1:01:42] have had to submit to and God has
[1:01:45] allowed it to be in a certain way to
[1:01:48] test us to check and see is the degree
[1:01:51] of humility there as it should be. Amen.
[1:01:55] And if it's not, oh, as the children of
[1:01:57] God, we can rise and say, God, let me
[1:02:00] have that degree that's needed in this
[1:02:02] situation. Because the real reality is
[1:02:05] when God brings us into many situations,
[1:02:08] it's a point and a place to recognize
[1:02:11] our need for more of God. That's why the
[1:02:13] prophet standing there when the bull
[1:02:15] came, the man came across the platform.
[1:02:17] He said it like this. He said, "Oh, if I
[1:02:19] could only stay in that atmosphere all
[1:02:22] the time."
[1:02:25] So, it wasn't just him walking in that
[1:02:27] atmosphere everything. No, but every
[1:02:30] situation demanded him to do what?
[1:02:34] Submit himself to the word of God. Amen.
[1:02:38] And the word of God is not just this
[1:02:40] this this right here, this cannon. Not
[1:02:43] just letters, but it's the nature. Amen.
[1:02:47] It's the nature. It's the life. It's the
[1:02:49] person. This is why that in every
[1:02:51] situation is is that well, how are we
[1:02:53] going to deal with this? Well, first of
[1:02:55] all, we're going to deal with it and
[1:02:56] conduct ourselves like sons and
[1:02:58] daughters of God.
[1:03:00] Amen. That's why the Bible would say
[1:03:02] even in Philippians that, you know,
[1:03:04] don't don't be a reproach out there
[1:03:05] among, you know, crooked and a and and a
[1:03:08] wicked generation. Don't be a reproach,
[1:03:10] but be a light that shines. Let Christ,
[1:03:12] let his light shine through you. Amen.
[1:03:16] But this is a willingness. I understand
[1:03:18] these these scriptures when we look at
[1:03:20] them we understand that look Peter Peter
[1:03:24] was also one who wrote when they wanted
[1:03:29] to clo tell them you're going to stop
[1:03:32] preaching you're going to stop doing
[1:03:33] this that's where Peter drew the line
[1:03:38] because why it was an infringement upon
[1:03:41] God's word he said where to rather to
[1:03:44] obey obey God rather than Amen.
[1:03:48] Amen. But yet within this here when
[1:03:51] everything itself is right and lawful
[1:03:53] and everything else, boy, what a
[1:03:55] testimony that God would allow us to be
[1:03:58] able to have because you know, friends,
[1:04:00] let me just say this to you. You could
[1:04:01] be able to spit the message out left and
[1:04:04] right. And I believe in getting in the
[1:04:06] message. You could be able to spit out
[1:04:08] the scriptures left and right. But what
[1:04:10] good does all that do us if we don't
[1:04:13] have the character of it? Amen. If we
[1:04:16] don't have the character of it, then
[1:04:17] it's a reproach.
[1:04:21] I say this, I would rather have that
[1:04:23] character in my life than be able to
[1:04:26] spit out all the quotes and all the
[1:04:28] scriptures. I want my life to match his
[1:04:31] word.
[1:04:33] Because after all, that's where real
[1:04:35] leadership comes from in our homes.
[1:04:38] That's where leadership comes from is a
[1:04:41] living image, not a book of rules of dos
[1:04:44] and don'ts and we do this and they do
[1:04:46] that. It must be a living example, a
[1:04:49] vision that the children can follow.
[1:04:52] That's the truth.
[1:04:55] Now,
[1:04:56] 1 Peter 2:18, servants,
[1:05:00] be subject to your masters with all
[1:05:03] fear. That's reverence.
[1:05:06] Not only to the good and gentle. Ah, but
[1:05:10] also to the fro
[1:05:14] man.
[1:05:16] But you see what God is doing
[1:05:18] through even these situations that these
[1:05:21] are moments that God is working to bring
[1:05:24] forth his character out of our life.
[1:05:27] Amen.
[1:05:29] See when situations itself when God
[1:05:32] because you know what this requires? It
[1:05:34] requires the ability of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:36] in your life and my life to take the
[1:05:39] word, submit to the word, and then that
[1:05:41] to be displayed as we subject ourselves
[1:05:45] to others.
[1:05:48] And that takes more than human
[1:05:49] instrumentality.
[1:05:51] And let me just say this to you. The
[1:05:53] Holy Spirit is able to overthrow not
[1:05:56] only that old birth, that first birth,
[1:05:59] but he's able to come in and overthrow
[1:06:02] every complex. Hallelujah. He's able to
[1:06:05] master and bring into subjection every
[1:06:09] part of our life.
[1:06:11] How many witnesses to that? The Holy
[1:06:13] Spirit dealing with our hearts, moving
[1:06:15] in our lives. So, showing all showing
[1:06:18] showing all meekness unto all men. But
[1:06:20] notice Peter said to your masters with
[1:06:23] all fear, not only to the good and
[1:06:25] gentle, but also to the fraward. So, I
[1:06:27] just want to say that in everything that
[1:06:29] we do, it going to require sacrifice.
[1:06:32] Yeah, it's going to require sacrifice.
[1:06:34] You see, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost
[1:06:37] will always subject himself to his own
[1:06:40] word, right? And as I said moments ago,
[1:06:42] it'll be the character, it'll be the
[1:06:45] nature, and it'll be the order of his
[1:06:47] word.
[1:06:49] It'll always do that. So, we're looking
[1:06:51] for even in the conduct in the nature.
[1:06:53] So, now I want you to think of how look
[1:06:56] look even in the simplicity of uh the
[1:06:59] Ethiopian unic when he came the
[1:07:01] scriptures. This has always stood out to
[1:07:03] me in the scriptures. When he came, the
[1:07:05] Bible says that he was a man and he he
[1:07:08] knew what it was to be under authority.
[1:07:11] And I want you to notice how he knew.
[1:07:13] Look, watch this response. This was
[1:07:14] something in in the natural. You say,
[1:07:16] "Oh, it's it takes something, you know,
[1:07:19] uh, it's got to be something way after
[1:07:22] the spirit of God comes." No, remember
[1:07:24] why the prophet tells us why God chose
[1:07:26] Elisha.
[1:07:29] He said the reason God chose chose
[1:07:31] Elisha was because he could plow
[1:07:33] straight roads.
[1:07:37] I may look at that and think, well, oh,
[1:07:38] that that's based on ability. I I I
[1:07:41] think we I think we're think that's too
[1:07:43] shallow to look at it that way. I wonder
[1:07:45] how many times that Elisha went back
[1:07:46] over and back over and back over a row.
[1:07:48] It wasn't that every time that he hit
[1:07:50] the mark. I wonder how many times you
[1:07:52] might say he might have been a
[1:07:53] perfectionist, but what it was is God
[1:07:55] seen that he wasn't just going to let
[1:07:57] just anything go. It has to be straight.
[1:08:00] Amen. And I believe that's the same
[1:08:02] thing that burns within our hearts
[1:08:04] because this, listen, that part in you
[1:08:06] that desires that rest and that
[1:08:08] settleness because there is a place of
[1:08:12] rest and settleness in the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:16] There is a place of divine assurance.
[1:08:18] Amen. Hallelujah. The Roman centurion,
[1:08:22] even him, when he came, he recognized.
[1:08:26] And what was this? That was fear. That
[1:08:29] was reverence. He said, "I'm a man under
[1:08:31] authority." So, he was able to even
[1:08:33] respond within that way. Now, he's able
[1:08:37] to respond and and catch this now. So,
[1:08:39] it's going to take sacrifice. And I want
[1:08:42] you to see here within this of
[1:08:44] sacrifice. when brother Brandham, you
[1:08:45] know, when he was looking at many of
[1:08:47] these things and he's dealing with where
[1:08:49] the sacrifice would be. And he says,
[1:08:51] "Now, you're going to have to sacrifice
[1:08:54] not money." And he's just asked the
[1:08:56] church, "How many want to say a real
[1:08:58] Bible order church?" He said, "You're
[1:09:00] going to have to sacrifice not money.
[1:09:02] You're going to have to sacrifice what?
[1:09:04] Some of your own ideas. You're going to
[1:09:07] have to sacrifice some time in prayer.
[1:09:10] You're going to have to sacrifice maybe
[1:09:12] a stubborn will to break down in
[1:09:15] humility.
[1:09:17] You're going to have, he said, the whole
[1:09:19] Christian move is sacrificial. He that
[1:09:23] will follow me, let him deny himself,
[1:09:25] take up his cross and follow me daily.
[1:09:28] How oft do you have to sacrifice? Every
[1:09:30] day. Paul said he died daily. Every day
[1:09:35] he died.
[1:09:37] So you see God allow let me let me me
[1:09:39] say this God allows these things to
[1:09:41] arise and if we can recognize remember
[1:09:44] the prophet said we are to lay in the
[1:09:46] presence of the sun until all the
[1:09:48] greenness is baked out of us
[1:09:52] right he said may God ripen our lives
[1:09:56] until we become the bread on his table.
[1:09:59] Do you realize what that speaks of
[1:10:01] becoming the bread on his table is the
[1:10:03] rapture. Glory. Amen.
[1:10:06] Because we go to the wedding supper, the
[1:10:08] bread on his table.
[1:10:11] This then we will take communion once
[1:10:13] again. What is it? It's the product of
[1:10:15] his word that has come to full fruition.
[1:10:19] Say, "Oh God, let me lay not in the
[1:10:21] presence of my ideas, not in the
[1:10:23] presence of my feelings,
[1:10:26] but let me lay in the presence of the so
[1:10:30] that is able to dissolve and melt away
[1:10:32] and cast away every complex and break
[1:10:36] every hole and let me see myself as God
[1:10:39] sees me and always has as a son and
[1:10:41] daughter of God and yield to that."
[1:10:46] Hallelujah. So it's submissive.
[1:10:49] That's why brother Brandham in the
[1:10:51] unssage messaged the unpardonable sin.
[1:10:53] He's dealing with things that he says,
[1:10:55] you know, you're not saved by any good
[1:10:57] works.
[1:10:59] If you're a believer, you're a
[1:11:00] Christian. If you're not a believer,
[1:11:01] you're not a Christian. You're not saved
[1:11:03] by it goes through many things. Dancing
[1:11:05] in the spirit, speaking in tongues,
[1:11:07] keeping Sabbath, eating meat, joining
[1:11:09] church, by water baptism. You are saved
[1:11:11] by faith. Through grace are you saved.
[1:11:14] And he said, 'If you are truly saved,
[1:11:16] these other things come. You can you
[1:11:19] speak with tongues, you could shout, you
[1:11:21] can praise God. The spirit of the
[1:11:23] prophets is subject to the prophet. And
[1:11:25] when the pastor sees something wrong and
[1:11:27] he says, "Look, sister or brother,
[1:11:30] that's wrong. You're submissive." That's
[1:11:32] right. You're submissive.
[1:11:36] That's a part of the Holy Spirit.
[1:11:40] You see this is why that all the other
[1:11:42] things that could be done but if this
[1:11:45] isn't coming out the Holy Spirit it it
[1:11:48] brings us into submission to the word of
[1:11:52] the very person of Jesus Christ nature
[1:11:55] and all you understand what I'm saying
[1:11:57] when the Bible says this uh that beloved
[1:12:00] now truly are we the sons of God we just
[1:12:03] this is not just a doctrine it's not
[1:12:05] just something that we oh praise God
[1:12:06] we're the sons of God that is to be a
[1:12:09] scripture in every situation.
[1:12:12] Even when things aren't going our way,
[1:12:14] even when we're offended, because
[1:12:16] offenses will come.
[1:12:19] Are you hearing me? That's still the
[1:12:21] mark that we're called to. Do we do we
[1:12:23] at that moment subject our own will and
[1:12:27] act like a son and daughter of God or
[1:12:28] revert back to
[1:12:31] what we've always done? See, there's got
[1:12:34] to come a change. There's got to come a
[1:12:37] change. Yeah. You know what I think the
[1:12:39] ultimate would be is to have such such
[1:12:42] such that depth of God in our life to
[1:12:44] where no one knows who are our friends
[1:12:47] and who are enemies. To where no one
[1:12:50] knows what we agree with and what we
[1:12:52] don't.
[1:12:55] You say, "Where do you get that?" Well,
[1:12:57] brother Billy Paul was asked the
[1:12:58] question, "What's the greatest miracle
[1:13:00] you ever saw?" And brother Billy Paul
[1:13:02] saw many. He said, "But I'll tell you
[1:13:04] the greatest miracle," he said, "that I
[1:13:05] see in my daddy's ministry," he said,
[1:13:07] "is that you couldn't tell his friends
[1:13:09] from his enemies."
[1:13:12] That's Christlike.
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:15] That's Christlike. That that to me, you
[1:13:17] know, look, I think that's powerful. And
[1:13:19] the reason I say it's powerful because
[1:13:20] what what I'm looking at is is the same
[1:13:23] Holy Spirit, the same quickening power,
[1:13:25] the same abstract to the title deed that
[1:13:27] brought the prophet into the word and
[1:13:30] his position is the same Holy Spirit
[1:13:32] operating in you and I that will bring
[1:13:34] us into the same position and overthrow
[1:13:37] even the hold of our family tree and
[1:13:40] break away complexes and everything else
[1:13:43] to where we're able to stand there as a
[1:13:45] son and daughter of God based on what
[1:13:48] God has said about me. Hallelujah.
[1:13:51] That's powerful. And I'm going to tell
[1:13:54] you, the word working in your life is
[1:13:56] more powerful than every every offense,
[1:14:00] than everything that has ever taken
[1:14:02] place in your life. There is nothing
[1:14:04] that can that can bring healing, that
[1:14:07] can bring repair, that can bring a
[1:14:08] dissolving of doubt. There is nothing
[1:14:11] that can do that outside of the word of
[1:14:13] God being in you. Hallelujah. That's the
[1:14:16] truth. Hallelujah. I say God have the
[1:14:19] right away.
[1:14:22] Hallelujah.
[1:14:23] Prophet goes on. He says, "The spirit of
[1:14:25] the prophets is subject to the prophet."
[1:14:27] Just submits and says, "God, forgive me.
[1:14:30] I didn't mean to get out of order. I'm
[1:14:32] ready." Oh, he said, "If the church
[1:14:33] would move on, then you're going to see
[1:14:35] a church moving for the glory of God."
[1:14:38] The spirit of the prophets is subject to
[1:14:40] the prophet. Everything is in order. And
[1:14:42] the church set in order. But if you'd
[1:14:45] get their head stuck up and say, "I
[1:14:47] don't believe you. I just tell you I
[1:14:50] don't believe." That shows right there
[1:14:52] there's something wrong with you. That's
[1:14:55] wrong. There is something wrong. You
[1:14:58] can't stand correction. You know what I
[1:15:00] mean?
[1:15:02] Now, let me just say this. This is this
[1:15:04] is what's powerful friends is because
[1:15:07] you see within this
[1:15:09] brother Ram talked about when Uzziah
[1:15:13] rejected being corrected he said it
[1:15:16] ruined his whole influence.
[1:15:20] Brother Brandham said everybody can tell
[1:15:22] when you won't adhere to the word in the
[1:15:24] same quote he said it ruins your
[1:15:26] influence. You you have to remember we
[1:15:29] have to remember that e the way that
[1:15:31] even that we respond listen even within
[1:15:33] all of this and we're still ordained and
[1:15:35] what God desires is that we would still
[1:15:37] be channels. But you know what that's
[1:15:39] all dependent on is how we react to
[1:15:41] correction because we're all and we all
[1:15:43] have been and we all will be
[1:15:45] continually. There's correction going
[1:15:47] on. Listen, even while the word is going
[1:15:50] in the midst of a service where it's
[1:15:51] just my goodness, just knocked down,
[1:15:54] swinging from the raptur's grace,
[1:15:55] there's correction going on even in that
[1:15:58] time.
[1:15:59] Yes, there is. Because the word itself,
[1:16:02] it's not a word of putting down. It's a
[1:16:04] word of lifting up.
[1:16:06] And this is, you know, I've never never
[1:16:08] been in a service where the grace of God
[1:16:10] is moving over our hearts and ever feel
[1:16:12] like I can just go out and do whatever I
[1:16:14] want to. No, it makes me want to
[1:16:16] rededicate my life to him. It makes me
[1:16:19] want to reconsecrate. It wants me It
[1:16:21] makes me want to be that much more
[1:16:23] fervor. Why? His love being expressed.
[1:16:26] Amen.
[1:16:28] Brings correction in our life. Yes.
[1:16:29] There's there's more. I can tighten up
[1:16:31] right here. I can tighten up here. I can
[1:16:32] tighten up here. Amen.
[1:16:36] But it shows when something's wrong and
[1:16:38] you can't stand correction. And you know
[1:16:40] what I mean? Brother Bramis goes on and
[1:16:43] says this in Revelations chapter 5 part
[1:16:46] two. A man that can't stand the
[1:16:48] scripture correction gets all angry and
[1:16:50] blows up. It shows he's not right with
[1:16:54] God. But a genuine saint of God will be
[1:16:57] reconciled to God by the word. And the
[1:17:01] word is the correcting way.
[1:17:03] That's that's not the quality of a saint
[1:17:06] of God. Now somebody let me just say it
[1:17:09] like this. Do I believe that somebody
[1:17:11] can get out of line? Sure, I believe
[1:17:13] that. But I believe this right here. If
[1:17:15] the Holy Spirit is in your heart, you
[1:17:17] can't stay out of line.
[1:17:19] Amen. And you know what? You will come.
[1:17:22] God's provided way. Repent of the
[1:17:24] actions because the spirit of God will
[1:17:27] correct you right there to repent of it.
[1:17:30] And I tell you what that does. That
[1:17:31] overthrows Satan's hold.
[1:17:35] Repentance is not elementary. repentance
[1:17:37] itself, that is the goodness of God that
[1:17:40] leads us to there. And even in this age,
[1:17:43] it's an age of such pride and such
[1:17:46] resentment that it doesn't want to
[1:17:48] repent. It doesn't feel like it's wrong.
[1:17:50] It's an age of arguing. It's an age I'm
[1:17:52] a victim. It's an age of my rights. It's
[1:17:54] it's an age about self. That's the
[1:17:57] spirit of the age. But the Holy Spirit
[1:18:00] is here to anoint our hearts to say,
[1:18:02] "It's not about me, Lord. It's about
[1:18:05] you." Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:18:09] If not for God's grace, we would be
[1:18:12] caught within the same way. Amen. That's
[1:18:14] true. So, we know something's not right.
[1:18:16] If it blows up and gets angry and
[1:18:18] everything else, it's not right. So, let
[1:18:20] me just say it like this. We our lives
[1:18:22] should be approachable. There's not one
[1:18:24] of us in here that should not be
[1:18:26] approachable.
[1:18:30] It shouldn't be, oh my goodness, we got
[1:18:32] a handle with rubber gloves.
[1:18:36] That shouldn't be.
[1:18:39] I mean, if we're sons and daughters of
[1:18:41] God, the opening scripture is subjecting
[1:18:43] ourselves to one another. Listen, we're
[1:18:45] in this for one common cause, one common
[1:18:48] vision, and that's the rapture.
[1:18:50] Hallelujah.
[1:18:51] Let me just tell you, the rapture is not
[1:18:53] happening without divine order. God sent
[1:18:56] his word in this hour to bring us into
[1:18:59] divine order for the rapture. Amen.
[1:19:03] What took place on Mount Carmel didn't
[1:19:05] happen just with sticks laying
[1:19:07] everywhere, stones laying everywhere,
[1:19:09] and and a sacrifice, what, however you
[1:19:10] want to cut it up. But it had to all
[1:19:13] come into divine order. And you know,
[1:19:15] when the fire fell, the fire failed to
[1:19:17] vindicate that the order that was
[1:19:19] presented was God's divine order. And
[1:19:22] the spirit came to confirm the order.
[1:19:26] Hallelujah. Let me tell you, you want
[1:19:28] God to come on the scene. No matter what
[1:19:30] the need is in your home, in your life,
[1:19:33] just let your life be put in order by
[1:19:35] the word and the fire will follow it.
[1:19:42] Must be approachable.
[1:19:44] And I'll tell you what approachable is.
[1:19:48] It's friendly and easy to talk to,
[1:19:50] right?
[1:19:52] not a porcupine,
[1:19:55] not always wearing their their fillings
[1:19:56] on the s on the on the edge of their of
[1:19:59] their shirts.
[1:20:00] Hello. Listen, nobody said the
[1:20:02] correction was easy. I mean, it stings,
[1:20:06] but if there's something on the inside
[1:20:09] that's able to rise up and and and give
[1:20:12] and and grace, it smarts a little bit at
[1:20:14] first, but you know, we want to we want
[1:20:17] to be approachable. Amen.
[1:20:21] Now, let me just let me just say this
[1:20:23] right here. The Bible tells us in the
[1:20:27] scriptures that the fear of the Lord is
[1:20:30] the beginning of knowledge.
[1:20:33] I understand all mysteries, but if this
[1:20:36] right here is missed, we're missing it.
[1:20:39] The fear of the Lord, the reverence of
[1:20:41] the Lord is the beginning, the principle
[1:20:44] part of knowledge. But fools despise
[1:20:47] wisdom and instruction.
[1:20:50] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:20:53] wisdom. And the knowledge of the holy is
[1:20:56] understanding. See, it's it's reverence.
[1:21:00] Reverence is respect. Brother said, "You
[1:21:03] can't have respects until you first fear
[1:21:05] the Lord." And when you fear the Lord,
[1:21:07] you have respect. Brother said it this
[1:21:08] way. He says, "I fear lest I would
[1:21:11] offend somebody in the community. I fear
[1:21:14] lest I would disappoint my wife. I I
[1:21:16] fear less the congregation I fear. He
[1:21:18] goes all the way down. Why what's why is
[1:21:20] he saying that? Because recognizing that
[1:21:22] God is present.
[1:21:26] Let me just drop that here for tonight.
[1:21:28] So correction come in many different
[1:21:30] ways. It comes right across the pullpit.
[1:21:32] Come right across in different things.
[1:21:34] And I'm just just be honest. These are
[1:21:36] not the correction parts and those
[1:21:37] things. Those are not my favorite things
[1:21:40] to preach. Right. Right. Those
[1:21:44] are the things that I I'll ask God.
[1:21:46] Lord, are you sure? And by the way, this
[1:21:49] is this has been sitting there for
[1:21:50] months.
[1:21:52] Lord, are you sure? Are you sure? Are we
[1:21:56] you know, Lord, do we But God knows. God
[1:21:59] knows. You know, this is why the Bible
[1:22:01] said, "Eat all the lamb, even the
[1:22:02] pertinence thereof."
[1:22:05] We got to eat the things that even that
[1:22:06] my are not so cut. But when we eat all
[1:22:09] of the word, oh, the benefit that it
[1:22:11] gives to us. Amen. Is that right? Notice
[1:22:14] this. Listen listen this like with
[1:22:16] deacons cuz we understand deacons you
[1:22:18] know they're the policemen of the of the
[1:22:19] house of God and how that God has placed
[1:22:22] them there. And I I'm not going to
[1:22:23] that'll be a separate service but I just
[1:22:25] you know just to look at how that they
[1:22:27] they were even approached. And I tell
[1:22:28] you what when I think of deacons I think
[1:22:30] Lord have mercy. You know I don't know I
[1:22:33] I just thank God. I thank God for the
[1:22:35] deacons he's given us. And I really I I
[1:22:38] can say that because I've watched
[1:22:42] I've watched these I've watched these
[1:22:45] brothers right with me. And I was
[1:22:47] talking to sister Anna um you know
[1:22:49] within it uh last night and I said,
[1:22:52] "Man, I remember brother Louie." Amen.
[1:22:55] You know, that was that was some of my
[1:22:56] first glimpses. If How many of you knew
[1:22:58] Brother Louie Miranda?
[1:23:00] Brother Louie was a man's man.
[1:23:03] The guy was no foolishness. That's
[1:23:04] right. No foolishness. He I remember one
[1:23:08] time somebody came in here and you know
[1:23:09] they always have their little little
[1:23:11] doctrines they want to drop and
[1:23:12] everything else and they slipped in
[1:23:14] while church was going on and put some
[1:23:16] kind of box back there with all their
[1:23:17] typed up synopsis of stuff and
[1:23:20] everything. I never forget brother Louie
[1:23:22] Miranda he was one of the deacons at the
[1:23:23] time and brother Gomez you probably
[1:23:25] remember this. We're sitting back in the
[1:23:26] office and that's when brother Louie had
[1:23:28] that cane. He said I tell you right now
[1:23:30] he said let's not wait. Let's go right
[1:23:31] to their house. He said we're not
[1:23:34] putting up with this nonsense.
[1:23:36] Oh, that wasn't God. No, it was godly
[1:23:38] because it's a policeman. Right. Right.
[1:23:42] I mean, somebody don't have God to come
[1:23:43] in and slip something in like that. That
[1:23:45] just so you see this why it shows you if
[1:23:47] there's anything to be brought to the
[1:23:49] church, I'm Let me just say it. To this
[1:23:51] church, it ain't going to come from
[1:23:52] private fellowship.
[1:23:55] Jesus said, "I'm the door. If it don't
[1:23:57] come through the door, it comes some
[1:23:58] other way. It's already
[1:24:01] It's a spirit that's out of check."
[1:24:04] That's right.
[1:24:06] That's the truth.
[1:24:08] Hallelujah. That's why the prophet said
[1:24:10] the pastor should be at all meetings.
[1:24:14] Well, how do we get there?
[1:24:18] But notice even with this, let's look at
[1:24:21] this. Brother Brandham's asked a
[1:24:22] question by some deacons. Brother
[1:24:23] Brandham, in respect to the order of the
[1:24:26] church, we have tried to go accordingly
[1:24:27] by the way we understand the orders
[1:24:29] given in the dedication of the new
[1:24:31] church. That's God in simplicity. And by
[1:24:34] doing so, some have gotten mad and left
[1:24:37] the church. And others will not listen
[1:24:40] to anything we say, especially the
[1:24:42] children. We have talked to the parents
[1:24:45] about their children and they won't take
[1:24:47] care of them. Now, have we misunderstood
[1:24:50] or are we going about it in the wrong
[1:24:52] way? Thanks. And brother Brandham lets
[1:24:54] them know you know you're doing what's
[1:24:56] right by keeping and holding to the to
[1:24:58] the new order and what was what was laid
[1:25:00] out here. And brother and brother
[1:25:02] Brandham answers it in that in that way
[1:25:04] you're doing just what you should. And
[1:25:06] then he answers that part about how that
[1:25:08] they've gotten mad and left the church
[1:25:09] and other things. And brother Brandham
[1:25:11] says they do it me too. You see, you
[1:25:14] realize that Brandon Tabernacle wasn't
[1:25:16] just some sweet perfect little place.
[1:25:18] That's right. What you realize is, and
[1:25:20] that should be no marvel, the very
[1:25:22] church that was talked about, put in the
[1:25:24] papers, run up on websites, was the
[1:25:26] church of Corenth. Oh my lord. This is
[1:25:29] the church the prophet started. Look at
[1:25:31] this church. They're getting drunk in
[1:25:33] church come out staggering. Oh my
[1:25:35] goodness. Can you believe that? Well,
[1:25:38] but but you know what? All of that right
[1:25:40] there it became became all them out
[1:25:42] there just were trying to look at that
[1:25:43] and all to discredit the work. But the
[1:25:45] main thing is that those that were doing
[1:25:47] it, they heeded to the correction of the
[1:25:49] word. You know why? God gave them
[1:25:51] understanding. Amen. And they received
[1:25:53] that understanding cuz you don't read
[1:25:55] about it again.
[1:25:58] Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] Now look at that. He says, you know,
[1:26:02] they do me too. A person that does that,
[1:26:05] there's something wrong with that
[1:26:06] person. They're not right with God. For
[1:26:09] the spirit of Christ is subject to
[1:26:12] Christ's teaching, Christ house, Christ
[1:26:15] order. Amen. Amen. It don't care how
[1:26:18] long, well, I've been staying two hours
[1:26:20] in prayer. You can't stay two hours in
[1:26:22] prayer and come out with an arrogant
[1:26:24] spirit. Amen. You can't say, "Well, I've
[1:26:27] been I tell you, I'm closer to God than
[1:26:29] I ever been before." You can't be closer
[1:26:31] to God and not act more like him.
[1:26:36] You can't you you can't get around smoke
[1:26:39] and not smell like smoke. And if you've
[1:26:42] been with Jesus, you're going to be
[1:26:43] sweet.
[1:26:46] If you've been in his presence, you're
[1:26:47] going to be sweet. That's why don't
[1:26:49] settle for religious acts. That's
[1:26:53] enticing spirits. Amen.
[1:26:57] That's why the prophet said people will
[1:26:59] go on fast and they'll go do this
[1:27:01] instead of submitting to the word of
[1:27:04] God. He said it's an enticing spirit.
[1:27:08] And you know what the word requires?
[1:27:10] Just surrender.
[1:27:12] Submission.
[1:27:14] Lay down our know-it-alls and submit to
[1:27:17] the word of God.
[1:27:19] That takes a son and daughter of God.
[1:27:21] Right?
[1:27:22] The person does that, something's wrong
[1:27:24] with that person. They're not right with
[1:27:25] God. For the spirit of Christ is subject
[1:27:28] to Christ's teaching, Christ house,
[1:27:30] Christ order. Any man or woman or
[1:27:32] persons that would get angry with a
[1:27:35] godly deacon that would tell them to be
[1:27:37] or any parent would get angry with the
[1:27:39] deacon. Now, let me just say this.
[1:27:43] The way that you react toward what you
[1:27:46] like and don't like, your children will
[1:27:49] follow that.
[1:27:50] That's right.
[1:27:53] If you get upset, if you pout, your
[1:27:56] children will do that. But hard to tell
[1:27:58] and what'll lay a hold of them when they
[1:27:59] go to acting like you.
[1:28:02] I'm not saying that to be funny. I'm
[1:28:04] saying where you don't know is the end
[1:28:06] result. You might have all this and get,
[1:28:08] you know, puffy and pouty and everything
[1:28:10] else, but listen, your children are
[1:28:13] going to respond the way they see you
[1:28:14] acting.
[1:28:17] And it's hard to tell what could lay
[1:28:19] hold on their lives when they're doing
[1:28:21] what you've done.
[1:28:23] That's why you want our act. That's why
[1:28:25] we're tested, friends. It matters. It
[1:28:27] matters. It matter. You God lets us. Let
[1:28:29] me just say this to you. I don't This is
[1:28:32] why I can say this about these men back
[1:28:34] here because I was a 14-year-old boy and
[1:28:37] brother Gomez came and pecked me on the
[1:28:39] shoulder and pulled out a drawing. I was
[1:28:41] drawing in the house of God. Let me tell
[1:28:43] you, as teenagers, don't be drawn in the
[1:28:45] house of God.
[1:28:48] be paying attention to the word of God.
[1:28:50] He came. I was drawn in a song book. You
[1:28:52] may not remember that, Brother Gomez,
[1:28:53] but I remember it,
[1:28:55] buddy. I was shaking, man.
[1:29:00] Mhm. But there's also a little bit about
[1:29:02] me. I thought, well, you know, I come
[1:29:04] back there, you know, in the office and
[1:29:05] and I'll never forget, man, I didn't
[1:29:06] know what was going to happen. And I
[1:29:08] tell you what, right in front of
[1:29:10] everyone, you can remember this. Oh,
[1:29:12] yeah. the sent brother Bill, your boys
[1:29:14] are right there. Even though they
[1:29:15] weren't the ones drawing, it was me. But
[1:29:17] I got dressed down good and I got
[1:29:20] dressed down all the way home. Let me
[1:29:22] tell you something I never did again.
[1:29:24] Never drew in church.
[1:29:28] And let me say what else. Brother
[1:29:31] Richard sitting back there, Brother
[1:29:34] Richard had been one that he would speak
[1:29:36] to me or my wife if he saw something out
[1:29:39] of line with our children.
[1:29:42] Now, I'm going to tell you something
[1:29:43] like that. I can respect a man like that
[1:29:45] because if if he would not come to me
[1:29:48] when I'm in the wrong, then I got less
[1:29:49] respect for him.
[1:29:54] Might as well give you a rose tonight.
[1:29:57] That way, it's better than getting
[1:29:59] tomatoes, isn't it?
[1:30:01] But we love you all. We really appre And
[1:30:03] this ain't even on Deacons tonight, but
[1:30:04] I I I just want to say it like this.
[1:30:08] Oh, brother Samuel, I know they've made
[1:30:10] mistakes. Let me quote Total Deliverance
[1:30:12] 1959.
[1:30:13] Brother Brandham said, "Now remember
[1:30:15] these are just men. They will make
[1:30:17] mistakes, but they're your deacons."
[1:30:22] Well, I didn't vote for them. You're a
[1:30:24] part of this assembly. And let me just
[1:30:26] say this. If you can't respect them,
[1:30:28] then you might want to find another
[1:30:29] church.
[1:30:33] I'm just I'm just speaking plain because
[1:30:35] it isn't about it's just like about well
[1:30:37] I didn't vote for this and I didn't vote
[1:30:39] for that and I don't care for so and so
[1:30:40] and I but remember I just read to you
[1:30:43] scriptures it doesn't matter of all the
[1:30:45] personalities gentle or f word or any
[1:30:48] see that that discredits all that stuff
[1:30:50] you know what that is we're letting too
[1:30:52] much humanity get in the way and we want
[1:30:54] to call it God it ain't nothing but just
[1:30:57] pure humanity
[1:31:03] Amen. Well, that was free.
[1:31:08] Brother Samuel, you getting in the
[1:31:09] flesh? Well, I've been in the flesh for
[1:31:11] 49 years. A son of God right in the
[1:31:14] flesh, anointed by the spirit of God,
[1:31:16] and I know where I'm standing. It is at
[1:31:18] times that we don't Sometimes we can't
[1:31:20] see eye to eye. Sometimes those things,
[1:31:22] like I said, that they can smart a
[1:31:24] little bit, but it depends on how do we
[1:31:26] respond. See, I want to see how does a
[1:31:29] person respond because how they respond
[1:31:31] tells me a lot about it. Doesn't matter
[1:31:33] what they were doing. It doesn't matter
[1:31:34] how spiritual it feels. If they respond
[1:31:36] in the wrong way, it shows it wasn't the
[1:31:39] spirit of God doing through them what
[1:31:41] they claimed he was doing. Why? By their
[1:31:44] actions. Now, these are not my words.
[1:31:46] These are the words of the prophet here.
[1:31:49] He says, "Really, notice this. If
[1:31:51] anybody would get angry with a godly
[1:31:52] deacon, really, look at this last one.
[1:31:55] We want everybody in this church that we
[1:31:57] can get. We do. All right. We do. I want
[1:32:01] everybody. I'm holding for everybody.
[1:32:04] But if that would only cause trouble
[1:32:05] somewhere else, there's a thorn or a
[1:32:08] rabbit in the wood pal pile as we used
[1:32:09] to say.
[1:32:11] And a rabbit in the wood pile. This was
[1:32:13] just for the translators who were
[1:32:14] translating this in the message of the
[1:32:16] hour. It's something that's not right
[1:32:18] and refers to a person that's out of
[1:32:20] place and unruly
[1:32:23] like hot potato.
[1:32:25] How do we handle them? How do we handle
[1:32:27] them? How do we
[1:32:32] But you see this scripture right here,
[1:32:35] this is why even when Paul would talk
[1:32:38] about being contentious about things and
[1:32:41] then even he says it in this way and
[1:32:43] he's just a question is asked for
[1:32:45] reflection. Which way came the word out
[1:32:47] from you or came it unto you only? If
[1:32:49] any man think himself to be a prophet or
[1:32:52] spiritual, that would mean preacher or
[1:32:54] spiritfilled, let him acknowledge that
[1:32:57] the things that I write unto you are the
[1:32:59] commandments of the Lord. But if any man
[1:33:02] be ignorant, let him be ignorant. See,
[1:33:04] once again, God don't make nobody tow
[1:33:06] the lie. That's true, right? If they
[1:33:09] want to be ignorant, but but that
[1:33:11] ignorance is not going to operate here,
[1:33:14] right? If they want to be ignorant, let
[1:33:16] them be ignorant. We're not here to
[1:33:18] force anybody to do any certain thing.
[1:33:21] That's why brother Brandham in his oh
[1:33:23] think of this in 1958 church order
[1:33:25] brother Brandham gave gave gave people
[1:33:27] an out. He said don't ever rise to where
[1:33:30] you think you know more about this than
[1:33:33] your pastor and I'd advise you not to do
[1:33:35] that but if you do I'd advise you to
[1:33:38] find another place to worship. You know
[1:33:39] what that is? That's grace. That's an
[1:33:41] out. Yes. Because don't, you know, you
[1:33:45] don't want to just sit somewhere and all
[1:33:47] of a sudden because remember the prophet
[1:33:49] said when there's a resentful spirit,
[1:33:51] the Holy Spirit won't reveal. And when
[1:33:54] that spirit is holding there, it can be
[1:33:56] an obstruction to healings taking place.
[1:33:59] And you know what'll happen? It'll give
[1:34:01] an account.
[1:34:02] Oh, brother Samuel, we're not coming to
[1:34:04] the white throne judgment, but every man
[1:34:06] must give account according to the deeds
[1:34:08] done in the body before the judgment
[1:34:10] seat of Christ. Right?
[1:34:14] We don't want to be guilty of that.
[1:34:17] Hallelujah. So, I I love how the prophet
[1:34:20] puts us here. This these terms,
[1:34:22] instructors
[1:34:24] and not bosses.
[1:34:28] Instructors and not bosses.
[1:34:31] There's a difference, right?
[1:34:35] Brother said, "God never sent Brother
[1:34:37] Neville and I to be bosses."
[1:34:40] Not at all. We're just your brothers,
[1:34:42] you see, instructors in the gospel. So,
[1:34:46] let's all work together.
[1:34:49] Remember, we're shepherds, not herdsmen.
[1:34:53] Shepherd is one who leads.
[1:34:56] He'll go, maybe one gets a little stray,
[1:34:58] he'll go and want to bring, you know,
[1:35:00] work to bring them back to the fold
[1:35:02] through the proper channels. And this is
[1:35:04] where notice he goes on. He says, "And
[1:35:07] sometimes something operating has to be
[1:35:09] called or said something about, called
[1:35:12] down or something on that order and the
[1:35:14] persons that's gots the gift rejects it,
[1:35:17] refuses it. The gift wasn't right. It
[1:35:21] wasn't God in the first place."
[1:35:25] So what determines whether it was God in
[1:35:27] the first place?
[1:35:29] their attitude, how they react, and how
[1:35:32] they respond.
[1:35:34] Right? That's just like a person saying,
[1:35:36] "Well, you know what? Here they come in.
[1:35:38] Maybe they come in late to church, and
[1:35:39] man, I got a special on my heart. Next
[1:35:42] service." Right? Hello. Next service.
[1:35:46] Make sure you let the song leaders know.
[1:35:48] You can text them. We've got their
[1:35:49] numbers. You can text them. Let them
[1:35:51] know. See, if it's that important, then
[1:35:54] you make preparations for it. Right. And
[1:35:57] I know sometimes we get caught in
[1:35:58] traffic and everything else. But listen,
[1:36:00] this is why this is why in a service,
[1:36:02] you think under the inspiration of the
[1:36:04] Holy Spirit, there is an uncctions that
[1:36:06] drop for songs to be sung. Even
[1:36:09] sometimes song leaders that will lead in
[1:36:12] upcoming services are receiving
[1:36:14] inspiration in this one service.
[1:36:18] It doesn't mean they got to get up right
[1:36:20] now and lead that. They understand the
[1:36:22] proper order and they understand that
[1:36:25] the leading is there and yet they'll
[1:36:27] present themselves before God and if
[1:36:29] that song doesn't drop within the list
[1:36:32] of songs, they're not going to sing it
[1:36:34] the next time. That's good. Hallelujah.
[1:36:37] Yeah, that's good. Same thing with the
[1:36:39] testimony. It drops in your heart. Make
[1:36:41] preparations before the service starts
[1:36:43] the next time. Let the deacons know. Let
[1:36:45] one of the brothers know. Let them know.
[1:36:47] Then you can be here and give it
[1:36:48] beforehand. Why? Inspiration drops. Lord
[1:36:51] have mercy. Can you imagine how long I'd
[1:36:53] keep you all after inspiration dropping
[1:36:55] after every service? Sometimes even
[1:36:57] after what I've got done preaching,
[1:37:00] let alone when somebody else, there's a
[1:37:01] proper order and a proper time.
[1:37:05] That's good. Is that right? Yes, sir.
[1:37:07] Notice the gift wasn't right. It wasn't
[1:37:09] God in the first place. The spirit of
[1:37:11] God is always ready for correction.
[1:37:16] Sweet and humble and willing.
[1:37:20] If it stands up and says, "I'll do it
[1:37:22] anyhow." Just remember, arrogant spirits
[1:37:26] are not of God. So good. And you know
[1:37:29] what arrogancy is? It's having an
[1:37:31] exaggerated sense of one's own
[1:37:34] importance.
[1:37:37] That's good. But what I had to say and
[1:37:39] what I had to do, that's called an
[1:37:41] arrogant spirit. Remember, love vaunteth
[1:37:45] not itself. It does not behave itself
[1:37:48] unseemingly. A gift of God will submit
[1:37:52] itself within the body of Christ or
[1:37:54] whatever whatever that God has called
[1:37:55] you to do. It will it will submit to the
[1:37:58] whole not pull apart. That's why brother
[1:38:01] Bram says don't pull your gift. He said
[1:38:02] take it and run off with it but submit
[1:38:05] it.
[1:38:09] So there's a great difference between a
[1:38:11] boss and an instructor. I I know I'm
[1:38:13] getting somewhere. You see, a boss just
[1:38:16] gives orders
[1:38:18] there. I mean, I don't know how many of
[1:38:20] you I, you know, I had I had I was
[1:38:22] privileged. I had a lot of times had
[1:38:24] good bosses some, you know, but a lot of
[1:38:27] times I had that. But there's other, you
[1:38:28] know, sometimes I know we all have our
[1:38:30] test and our trials and how we have to
[1:38:31] work through things. So, it isn't that,
[1:38:33] oh, brother Samuel was something great
[1:38:34] here. No, I mean, my trials came in
[1:38:36] different ways on my job. For for some
[1:38:38] of us, God allows that to operate in
[1:38:41] that way. And sometimes, listen,
[1:38:42] sometimes that about a boss, it really
[1:38:44] has nothing to do about a boss. It's
[1:38:46] just simply that we were injured under
[1:38:48] authority in the past. Yeah. And because
[1:38:50] of that injury, we've never dealt with
[1:38:52] it and we have a problem with authority
[1:38:54] yet still. That's so good. Because
[1:38:56] somebody's either taking advantage of
[1:38:58] us, someone has done something and and
[1:39:00] and it's so it's really not even that
[1:39:01] person standing there, but yet they are
[1:39:03] getting the full veheminy of what has
[1:39:06] taken place before and it's not even
[1:39:07] them. But God's grace is greater. I'm
[1:39:11] glad he's the great physician that he
[1:39:12] can go down and we can begin to realize,
[1:39:14] wait a minute, it had nothing to do with
[1:39:15] that person right there. It's God
[1:39:16] bringing something to light in my life.
[1:39:18] I tell you, I that's where I want to be.
[1:39:20] I want to say, God, let the MRI of the
[1:39:21] Holy Spirit pass over my life. If
[1:39:24] there's anything that's unlike you,
[1:39:25] Lord, show it out, Lord. Help me and
[1:39:27] give me grace to die to it, Lord. Amen.
[1:39:30] But an instructor, it's different. You
[1:39:32] know, I was just meditating. These
[1:39:33] things you just just meditating
[1:39:35] throughout the week and just over the
[1:39:36] weeks and thinking about an instructor
[1:39:38] is different. An instructor is one who
[1:39:40] has a vested interest. He's there to
[1:39:42] teach. He's there when what the desire
[1:39:45] is is to see. It's not just get this
[1:39:47] done and get this done and get this
[1:39:49] done, but there's a desire to see that
[1:39:52] instruction become flesh.
[1:39:56] You see, God God doesn't want his word
[1:39:59] just to remain in letter form.
[1:40:03] God doesn't even want his word just to
[1:40:05] be something we do because it's the
[1:40:07] right thing to do. But God wants that
[1:40:10] word to be engrafted in our heart. He
[1:40:14] wants to direct us and guide us in every
[1:40:16] part of our life.
[1:40:18] This is why this is why in the
[1:40:21] scriptures here, brother Brown, there's
[1:40:23] another place I could have went to, you
[1:40:24] know, but let me just skip over here in
[1:40:26] the scriptures because of time. Here in
[1:40:28] the scripture it says out of heaven
[1:40:33] let me go back to that here brother
[1:40:34] Graham refers to this verse when he's
[1:40:36] talking about how that he says I I
[1:40:38] believe in leadership but he says in
[1:40:41] that of of that leadership he said that
[1:40:44] is given what a believe is is that that
[1:40:47] leadership it's it's God and let me let
[1:40:50] me come back to this I believe in
[1:40:52] leadership but it's not the leadership
[1:40:53] of men I believe in I believe in the
[1:40:55] leadership of the Holy Spirit coming
[1:40:57] through the word. I believe also that
[1:40:59] God has set men in the church. Men who
[1:41:01] are gifted by the spirit and they will
[1:41:04] keep the church in order. I believe that
[1:41:06] I believe there's this church is ruled
[1:41:08] over by men that God sends to take
[1:41:10] charge. But that rule is by the word so
[1:41:14] that it is not men really ruling but the
[1:41:16] spirit of God. For the word and the
[1:41:18] spirit are one. That is a comfort to me.
[1:41:23] I'm just going to tell you the the
[1:41:25] challenge that even within this if God
[1:41:28] carries it'll be 23 years here in
[1:41:30] September have been standing here as a
[1:41:31] pastor the challenges they haven't
[1:41:33] gotten any easier and the weightiness of
[1:41:36] it of what lays before us it hasn't gone
[1:41:38] any easier any less but oh God the time
[1:41:41] the hour the season and where we're at
[1:41:43] it's a great burden
[1:41:46] and I could say it to you like this like
[1:41:48] I tell him walking up and down these
[1:41:49] aisles God give me the wisdom that I
[1:41:52] have needed of Lord give me the wisdom
[1:41:55] Lord that's needed for our lives in this
[1:41:58] moment
[1:42:03] that's why the here
[1:42:07] that's why when brother Brandon refers
[1:42:08] to that scripture remember them that
[1:42:09] have the rule over you who have spoken
[1:42:12] unto you the word of God whose faith
[1:42:15] follow considering the end of their
[1:42:17] conversation
[1:42:19] it's not a man who puts himself up there
[1:42:21] that's Right? It has to be God
[1:42:25] and God will vindicate that God
[1:42:28] vindicates that. It isn't a man. I tell
[1:42:30] you, I just say it like this. Brother
[1:42:31] Dan Daisy always said it and I was
[1:42:33] fellowshipping with another brother here
[1:42:36] uh not too long ago and I'll tell you
[1:42:38] just he he came right out and said it. I
[1:42:40] said, "Yeah." And and and please
[1:42:41] understand when we say this, he was
[1:42:43] talking about, you know, different ones.
[1:42:44] And it's like when, oh, there's a void
[1:42:45] in a church, man. Everybody's flooding
[1:42:46] in there. I can be their pastor. I can
[1:42:48] be their pastor. And you think to think
[1:42:50] that way, you're crazy.
[1:42:52] It's not about the church, right?
[1:42:54] Because I always look at it like this
[1:42:55] where brother says, "The man who thinks
[1:42:56] he can do the job, not the one God has,
[1:43:01] right? But it's the one I don't want to
[1:43:02] do it." That's the one that God said,
[1:43:03] "You're the one."
[1:43:07] Maybe if God carries, there'll be a day
[1:43:09] I'll be able to retire.
[1:43:11] Either that or the rapture, but we're
[1:43:13] going to press on. Notice what God said.
[1:43:15] Out of heaven, he made thee to hear that
[1:43:17] voice that he might instruct thee. and
[1:43:20] upon earth he showed thee his great fire
[1:43:22] and thou heardest his words out of the
[1:43:24] midst of fire. Notice God's instruction
[1:43:26] to our lives. I love this in Nehemiah 9.
[1:43:29] Thou gavest also thy good spirit to
[1:43:31] instruct them and withheld not thy mana
[1:43:35] from their mouth and gavest them water
[1:43:37] for their thirst. Now this bank of
[1:43:38] scripture, you're familiar as a as a
[1:43:40] Bible reader. These it isn't that they
[1:43:43] merited his good spirit to instruct
[1:43:46] them. This is after they had made the
[1:43:47] golden calf and everything. But it just
[1:43:49] goes to show that God even in that
[1:43:51] remember God said, "I'm not going to go
[1:43:52] up in the midst of you, but I'll go I'll
[1:43:54] lead you."
[1:43:56] But yet God led them. He was right there
[1:43:58] with them to lead them to the promised
[1:44:00] land.
[1:44:02] I love this. I will instruct thee and
[1:44:04] teach thee in the way which thou shalt
[1:44:07] go. I will guide thee with mine eye.
[1:44:13] And ye fathers, provoke not your
[1:44:16] children to wrath, but bring them up in
[1:44:19] the nurture
[1:44:21] and admonition of the Lord. And that,
[1:44:24] you know, we were speaking on that last
[1:44:26] the last time we spoke here about a
[1:44:28] month ago on a Thursday. The correction
[1:44:30] itself, even when Paul was correct in
[1:44:32] the the Corinthians,
[1:44:34] it's not to knock or take away the
[1:44:36] enthusiasm,
[1:44:39] but it's to channel it.
[1:44:41] He wasn't trying to extinguish the
[1:44:44] gifts.
[1:44:45] He wanted it to be channeled in the
[1:44:48] word.
[1:44:51] And so the nurture, I love this word in
[1:44:55] the scripture here because with the
[1:44:57] correction, it it's there to guide, not
[1:44:59] to bring them to a frustration. And even
[1:45:01] I think over the years when correcting
[1:45:03] the boys and
[1:45:05] maybe some a little bit more than others
[1:45:06] but all of them have needed and continue
[1:45:08] and and it's still it goes on but it's
[1:45:11] in different you know works in different
[1:45:12] forms and different things but you just
[1:45:14] you be you you realize that within the
[1:45:17] things within the nurturing there's
[1:45:19] sometimes where there was uh judgment
[1:45:22] that was measured out as far as
[1:45:23] correction where they knew they were
[1:45:25] wrong and there was some sort of a
[1:45:26] consequence but see I I want you to
[1:45:29] understand correction is always not
[1:45:30] about a sting. Yeah, good. You know,
[1:45:34] it's not always about the belt or the
[1:45:35] rod, but remember this scripture right
[1:45:38] here on nurture means the whole training
[1:45:42] of the child. It's the whole training.
[1:45:44] It's working with them on now reproofs,
[1:45:46] now command. It's it's giving guidance
[1:45:48] for things that even we're in the midst
[1:45:50] of even maybe somewhere they're
[1:45:51] approaching and you begin to just deal
[1:45:53] with maybe their attitude on something.
[1:45:55] It's not even about what's right and
[1:45:56] wrong. It's about their attitude. And so
[1:45:59] you're dealing with some of these things
[1:46:00] and what what what's that with for them
[1:46:02] for there to become a correction to let
[1:46:04] them see hey further on down the line if
[1:46:06] you if you come if this is not corrected
[1:46:08] this will wear to be further on down the
[1:46:10] line these guys have heard this so much
[1:46:12] as far as like oh man you know I mean I
[1:46:16] probably the what what followed within
[1:46:18] of the correction was like oh man here
[1:46:20] here goes dad you know and you you don't
[1:46:21] want to belabor the point but yet I have
[1:46:23] that that part about me you know and
[1:46:25] just going and but yet what I'm saying
[1:46:27] the desire ire is well why was that the
[1:46:29] desire is to take every opportunity not
[1:46:31] always correcting them you know
[1:46:37] something comes to me it's not spiritual
[1:46:39] but I'm going to go ahead and say it
[1:46:40] ain't spiritual the prophet referred to
[1:46:42] other things so many of you watched
[1:46:44] probably finding Nemo
[1:46:49] but there's one little part in that
[1:46:51] movie that always that really stood out
[1:46:52] to me and caused me to ponder and that
[1:46:54] was
[1:46:56] you find his father taking him to school
[1:46:59] and he was watch out for this, watch out
[1:47:00] for that, watch out for this, watch out
[1:47:01] for that, watch out for this, watch out
[1:47:02] for that, watch out for this, watch out
[1:47:03] for this, watch out for that, watch out
[1:47:04] for that.
[1:47:07] And that's what he was trying to get
[1:47:09] away from,
[1:47:11] right? And now the father wasn't doing
[1:47:13] that to say, you know what, I just feel
[1:47:15] like being on your case today.
[1:47:18] Can you put a saddle on your nerve so I
[1:47:19] can ride it? No.
[1:47:22] The father was doing I'm saying,
[1:47:24] friends, listen. when I just saw that
[1:47:25] little bit right there. Look, if the if
[1:47:28] the spirit of God could speak to the
[1:47:29] prophet through a cigarette pack, right?
[1:47:32] Yeah. Come on, friends. We're people of
[1:47:34] truth. That's right. We're people of
[1:47:37] truth.
[1:47:39] That's good. But I never forget that. It
[1:47:41] was just a simple statement I think
[1:47:43] that, you know, that that that he made
[1:47:44] back to his father. It was just like
[1:47:46] because his father was always on him
[1:47:48] instead of being a buddy. Now, I
[1:47:51] understand our kids have to have
[1:47:53] correction. There are things that it
[1:47:54] isn't being a buddy like I'm just going
[1:47:55] to let them do whatever they want to do
[1:47:57] and you know they're they're five years
[1:47:58] old and 10 years old I'm just going to
[1:48:00] be their buddy. No, they're going to
[1:48:01] become a Helen.
[1:48:04] You still you've got to give direction
[1:48:06] but being a friend is something that
[1:48:10] you're always able to be.
[1:48:13] That means guidance direction and it
[1:48:16] even is in the times to where sometimes
[1:48:18] just be with them and a friend. So we're
[1:48:20] with relationship because all of the
[1:48:23] correction that can be given this is
[1:48:24] wrong that's right this is wrong and
[1:48:26] that's right that right there can breed
[1:48:28] rebellion if relationship is not greater
[1:48:32] than all the correction
[1:48:35] relation you say what's relationship
[1:48:36] it's a simple things you don't even have
[1:48:38] to use money to do to build relationship
[1:48:40] it's time
[1:48:42] it's time in a different manner where
[1:48:43] they see you in a different light
[1:48:45] sisters in their in in the kitchen you
[1:48:47] know baking and and things like that
[1:48:49] maybe bringing And you know the daughter
[1:48:50] in here, they're just kind of doing
[1:48:51] something. Haha. You know, and
[1:48:52] everything just kind of moving around
[1:48:53] like that. It's a different light. And
[1:48:56] the father, they because what it is,
[1:48:57] you're seeing them in a different light.
[1:49:01] Wow. That's good for you. Some of you
[1:49:04] going to look at, man, let me take that
[1:49:05] point out on Finding Nemo. You're going
[1:49:07] to be going to YouTube.
[1:49:09] [Laughter]
[1:49:13] Oh my. Let's stand.
[1:49:17] But it's nurture and admonition in the
[1:49:20] Lord.
[1:49:21] That's why the scripture could say, "All
[1:49:23] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[1:49:25] and profitable for doctrine, for
[1:49:28] reproof, for correction, for
[1:49:30] instruction, and righteousness. Why?
[1:49:32] That the man of God may be perfect,
[1:49:35] thoroughly furnished unto all good
[1:49:38] works."
[1:49:40] My and this scripture here, I love this.
[1:49:44] I will bless the Lord who hath given me
[1:49:47] counsel.
[1:49:49] My reigns also instruct me in the night
[1:49:52] season. When I
[1:49:55] looking at that scripture and just
[1:49:56] pondering that over the time and days
[1:49:59] and looking at that, you see this is the
[1:50:01] goal is that it enters into our heart to
[1:50:04] where our heart is in submission to it.
[1:50:08] Now
[1:50:10] God has helped us to be able to see this
[1:50:12] no doubt in a
[1:50:15] multiple layers and things or homes and
[1:50:18] other things. But then you see how the
[1:50:21] prophet I thank God that things that
[1:50:24] were gone into in this hour
[1:50:27] like we were covering the last time
[1:50:30] where brother Brandham comes with an
[1:50:32] understanding and it was really to help
[1:50:35] the Pentecostal people those who
[1:50:38] they felt leadings I feel led to do this
[1:50:41] and I feel led he didn't discredit
[1:50:42] leadings but he was trying he was
[1:50:45] working to get them to understand
[1:50:46] there's a difference between the gift
[1:50:49] and the Holy Spirit,
[1:50:52] the gift in a person's life. And he said
[1:50:55] he made a statement just like this. And
[1:50:57] I I don't have that, but I want to just
[1:50:59] refer to it here. To me, this is a very
[1:51:02] powerful statement where a prophet of
[1:51:04] God would would make it in a way that
[1:51:07] how he says if if you believe me, he
[1:51:12] said, and if you know you, I I I want to
[1:51:14] be correct. I want to be I want to be
[1:51:16] right. I want to be corrected. If you
[1:51:18] believe what God that what God is doing
[1:51:20] and what you see being vindicated and
[1:51:22] then he tells us going on further into
[1:51:25] that he said take for example the gift
[1:51:28] in my life he said there's been
[1:51:31] individuals I've seen in wheelchairs
[1:51:33] seen in other places
[1:51:36] and he said the gift
[1:51:39] tells me go pray for that person notice
[1:51:43] the gift tells me now you can place that
[1:51:47] in many different facets across the
[1:51:50] board. Don't just leave it in gift of
[1:51:51] healing or tongues or whatever more.
[1:51:53] Place it in everywhere. Specials,
[1:51:55] testimonies, preaching, playing place it
[1:51:59] across husband, wife, place it across
[1:52:01] everything. The gift itself
[1:52:04] is telling me to do this because even as
[1:52:06] a husband, even as a wife, even as a
[1:52:08] father, mother, that attribute's within
[1:52:10] you, right? Remember, brother Brown
[1:52:12] tells us when when Becky ran out the
[1:52:14] door and just what do you expect me to
[1:52:16] be a wallflower? He said, "I wanted to
[1:52:19] take my belt and go out after her."
[1:52:23] Right now, what was that? That was that
[1:52:25] part's father. But what happened is he
[1:52:29] submitted to the Holy Spirit in that
[1:52:31] manner. And when he did, even sister me,
[1:52:34] she didn't understand that submission.
[1:52:36] But what she did, she came under that.
[1:52:39] Right? So you you know the the story but
[1:52:42] the point is brother Ram says the gift
[1:52:44] is telling me to do that. He said even
[1:52:46] my heart my heart is wanting to do that.
[1:52:50] He said but then the Holy Spirit says
[1:52:53] not that one this one over here.
[1:52:57] And he says then I yield to the spirit
[1:53:02] of what he said to do. And brother Bram
[1:53:05] takes that just a whole long time. And
[1:53:06] to me that's instruction. Now,
[1:53:12] that's instruction that's laid within
[1:53:15] this message.
[1:53:17] That's instruction that was being given
[1:53:19] to those that were gathered there at
[1:53:21] Brandom Tabernacle and others because
[1:53:23] this church order was just not about
[1:53:24] brand tabernacle. It's for the body of
[1:53:25] Jesus Christ. That's right. For the
[1:53:27] brand very very clear with that. So, the
[1:53:31] point is is that it depends on whether
[1:53:36] we receive it or not.
[1:53:39] And that's what's always made the
[1:53:41] difference. It's always made the
[1:53:43] difference of where because when brother
[1:53:45] Brandham dealing with that, oh man,
[1:53:46] you're you're you're taken away from the
[1:53:48] Holy Spirit. You're taken away from
[1:53:49] this. And look, I didn't I didn't grow
[1:53:52] up in a Pentecostal church. My my mom
[1:53:55] for a lot of it was in church of God.
[1:53:58] Some of you been in other places and
[1:53:59] other things before.
[1:54:01] my father-in-law. They were in places
[1:54:04] where it was just like you come in and
[1:54:06] we're just going to obey the Holy Ghost
[1:54:08] tonight.
[1:54:11] And you don't know what that meant.
[1:54:13] Are we going to preach tonight? Are we
[1:54:16] going to sing tonight? Is it just going
[1:54:17] to be testimonies tonight? Is are are
[1:54:20] what's going to happen? You you don't
[1:54:22] know. Listen, those people are sincere.
[1:54:26] You understand me? They're sincere.
[1:54:29] And what a challenge.
[1:54:32] What a challenge that would have been
[1:54:34] because I think about even right now for
[1:54:36] God to break down and and break away
[1:54:38] ideas from our lives to help us to see,
[1:54:41] hey, listen, you're not failing me.
[1:54:44] You're following my leading.
[1:54:46] And I think about what a dying that was.
[1:54:48] And that's what brother says. We have to
[1:54:50] die to the old that the new might be
[1:54:52] born in. But it's liberating. You think
[1:54:55] about how when these when that teaching
[1:54:56] would come, you know what it would do?
[1:54:58] It breaks away holes. It breaks away
[1:55:00] ideas. And I'm so glad for God's grace
[1:55:03] in this hour because when we recognize
[1:55:06] we are under the leadership of the Holy
[1:55:09] Spirit, right? The pillar of fire has
[1:55:12] returned to the church of the living
[1:55:13] God. And God is leading us. He is
[1:55:16] directing us. He is guiding us. He's
[1:55:18] performing his word.
[1:55:20] Yes, sir. He's changing us from glory
[1:55:24] unto glory. Don't you love him? Amen.
[1:55:27] I'm so glad that God would come and
[1:55:30] instruct us in these ways and direct us,
[1:55:34] right? Sometimes, you know, even when
[1:55:36] you've waited, I don't mean to prolong.
[1:55:37] I know I've I've I've went longer, but
[1:55:40] uh you know, with within it, sometimes
[1:55:43] we we wrestle within ourselves
[1:55:45] sometimes. I was just talking to a a
[1:55:47] brother from another assembly and he was
[1:55:50] speaking to me and he said, you know, uh
[1:55:52] the brother there's a brother that he's
[1:55:54] been witnessing to that's you know
[1:55:56] really got bad news about cancer and
[1:55:58] things like that and and the brother had
[1:56:00] been coming to church and even when I
[1:56:01] ministered at the location that that the
[1:56:04] the man was there and we met him and you
[1:56:06] know and he re something about it he
[1:56:08] realizes it was a Catholic priest that
[1:56:10] came into his bedroom uh hospital room
[1:56:13] when they were doing all the diagnosis
[1:56:15] and stuff like that, but there was just
[1:56:17] something very sovereign that took
[1:56:18] place. And he he told the brother, he
[1:56:20] said, "I know that that that was not
[1:56:21] Roman Catholic what took place for me."
[1:56:24] He said it was something and and and the
[1:56:26] brother said, "I didn't even say
[1:56:27] anything to him about all that." He said
[1:56:28] it just something he just, you know, he
[1:56:29] just recognized it wasn't because of the
[1:56:31] priest. It was just God. And so he was
[1:56:34] just speaking of how he said, you know,
[1:56:36] he said, "I I want to see him get
[1:56:37] baptized. I want, you know, and he's got
[1:56:39] some some real bad news, you know, that
[1:56:41] come." I said, "Well, look, the same way
[1:56:43] you've been shining the light right now,
[1:56:45] just keep shining the light." And you
[1:56:47] have to look at it like this. This is to
[1:56:49] me, friends, the rest is that we don't
[1:56:52] have to make anybody anything.
[1:56:55] If someone's ordained to walk fully in
[1:56:57] that light, they'll walk fully in that
[1:56:58] light. And if they're not, but I thank
[1:57:00] God they've experienced salvation. And I
[1:57:02] just say it like this. We're not here to
[1:57:03] push anybody, right? We're not here to
[1:57:06] push. We're not here to shove. We just
[1:57:07] shine the light. And sometimes shining
[1:57:10] that light, I realize like the scripture
[1:57:12] said, compel because sometimes God knows
[1:57:14] there needs to be a compelling in order
[1:57:16] to break away certain things. But all of
[1:57:19] it is still within God's grace. And so
[1:57:22] sometimes we're looking at things in our
[1:57:24] lives and we should I do this, should I
[1:57:26] do this? Should I not do this? And
[1:57:27] should I do this? But you know, if we'll
[1:57:29] wait on the Lord, God will truly and
[1:57:31] always being in submission to him. God
[1:57:33] will never lead us wrong. He always lead
[1:57:36] us correctly. Amen. Amen. Don't you love
[1:57:38] him? Amen. Let's just go to him in
[1:57:40] prayer. Heavenly Father,
[1:57:43] Lord, how we are so thankful for your
[1:57:46] mercies once again tonight, Lord. We're
[1:57:48] nothing, Lord, without you. We realize,
[1:57:51] Lord, that even as we stand here, it's
[1:57:54] by the grace of God.
[1:57:56] Lord, I think of how many times down
[1:57:58] through my life and in this journey that
[1:58:02] God, you've corrected me. And I thank
[1:58:05] you for it, Lord.
[1:58:08] I appreciate it, Lord.
[1:58:10] Lord, I appreciate God. How that Lord, I
[1:58:14] think of even the mentor that I had
[1:58:16] before me, Lord, and my dad and and
[1:58:20] other brothers, Lord, they never asked
[1:58:22] to be that, but God, they just been so
[1:58:25] dear to my heart. And I'm so thankful,
[1:58:28] God, for your leadership, for your
[1:58:31] direction.
[1:58:33] Lord, as I mentioned earlier here
[1:58:34] tonight, I'm so thankful, God, for the
[1:58:36] deacons you've given us. I'm thankful
[1:58:38] for every every brother and sister here
[1:58:41] tonight, Lord.
[1:58:43] Father, we know that,
[1:58:46] Lord Jesus, as the prophet said, we we
[1:58:49] want everybody, Lord.
[1:58:52] But Lord, I realize that each of us have
[1:58:55] a choice to make, Father.
[1:58:58] But I pray, Father, oh God, that no
[1:59:01] matter the choice that's made, may we,
[1:59:03] our choice be you. May it always be to
[1:59:06] go on further with you, Lord.
[1:59:10] Father, you know my heart even, Lord,
[1:59:12] when through the years, Lord, we've had
[1:59:15] some come and go. Some, Lord, that's
[1:59:17] passed through and they've received
[1:59:19] healing for a period of time.
[1:59:22] And Lord, how it
[1:59:25] it can hurt, but Lord, when I can see
[1:59:28] them going on with you. Oh, that's what
[1:59:30] I want. That's what I want, Lord.
[1:59:35] That's what we want,
[1:59:38] Lord. That's the real joy. That's the
[1:59:39] real delight is that they go on with
[1:59:42] you. Because after all, Lord,
[1:59:46] it's you. It's the rapture that's in
[1:59:48] view, Father. And I'm so glad, Lord,
[1:59:51] that you
[1:59:53] work on our lives. This word that we've
[1:59:56] used here, Lord, nurture tonight.
[1:59:59] It's that instruction which aims to
[2:00:02] increase virtue.
[2:00:05] Lord God, I pray may you just continue,
[2:00:08] Lord, to speak to our hearts. But most
[2:00:11] importantly, Lord,
[2:00:13] may you find hearts that are welcoming.
[2:00:17] May our spirits be welcoming, Lord.
[2:00:20] because that's the kind of spirit
[2:00:23] that's going to welcome your return.
[2:00:27] It's a welcoming spirit, Lord, inviting
[2:00:30] you, the examining, Lord, in our lives,
[2:00:35] Lord God, not just letters,
[2:00:39] not just chapters,
[2:00:41] but God, even the the examination of the
[2:00:45] character in our lives.
[2:00:49] We don't want to just be right in our
[2:00:50] doctrine. No.
[2:00:53] We want to be right in our hearts. Want
[2:00:56] to be right in our spirit.
[2:00:58] Lord, like your prophet told us in that
[2:01:00] that discernment of spirit, he said, if
[2:01:02] a man is right in his heart, but he's
[2:01:04] wrong in his doctrine, he said God will
[2:01:07] straighten him out because he's able to
[2:01:11] be straightened out.
[2:01:13] He's got the spirit of discernment on
[2:01:16] the inside.
[2:01:18] Lord, I think of good friends that I
[2:01:20] have, ministers.
[2:01:23] Some of them, Lord, they came in under
[2:01:26] different movements,
[2:01:28] different things, but God, how that
[2:01:29] you've worked through their lives. I
[2:01:31] thank Lord God some of the friends that
[2:01:34] you've given me. I didn't go out and
[2:01:36] look for them, Lord, but you've gave me
[2:01:38] friends. And I believe, Lord, with all
[2:01:39] my heart that you gave me friends,
[2:01:43] and also through those friends, you've
[2:01:45] taught me so much, Lord.
[2:01:48] It's not all together where we start,
[2:01:50] it's how we finish.
[2:01:54] Lord Jesus, give us grace, Lord. I pray.
[2:01:57] May the Spirit of Almighty God give us
[2:01:59] grace, Lord, to labor with one another,
[2:02:02] Lord. Give us grace, Lord God, in our
[2:02:06] hearts to be able to just so submit
[2:02:08] ourselves, Lord, to you.
[2:02:11] Oh Lord God, no matter where we're at.
[2:02:14] We might be at the grocery store.
[2:02:17] We might be, Lord God, in line somewhere
[2:02:19] else.
[2:02:20] It ain't about whether or not they're a
[2:02:22] believer or not. Your word is true
[2:02:25] whether they're a believer or not. Lord,
[2:02:28] the spirit of God is not something we
[2:02:30] hang up in the coat room back there
[2:02:34] beyond the restrooms and then put back
[2:02:36] on. No Lord, help us.
[2:02:41] Help us, Lord, like you would write
[2:02:43] through Paul to us. Put on that new man.
[2:02:46] Sink into that new man. Lord, we want to
[2:02:50] sink more into you. Thank you, Lord, for
[2:02:54] instruction. Thank you for guidance,
[2:02:56] Lord. Thank you for your mercies. Thank
[2:02:59] you for your good spirit, Lord, sent to
[2:03:02] instruct us and guide us, Lord. The
[2:03:04] spirit of truth. We love you tonight,
[2:03:07] Lord.
[2:03:09] Thank you Lord
[2:03:11] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:15] Hallelujah. Go ahead and lead us in.
[2:03:18] Oh, this is what I pray.
[2:03:26] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:03:37] Make my heart ever true.
[2:03:41] Change my heart, oh
[2:03:44] God.
[2:03:46] Yes, Lord.
[2:03:49] May I be like
[2:03:52] you
[2:03:56] would change my heart. Oh yes. Oh, I
[2:04:01] want to be that honest with him. Don't
[2:04:02] you, Lord God, change my heart.
[2:04:08] Give me the degree of love that I need,
[2:04:10] Lord. The degree of humility that I need
[2:04:13] right now
[2:04:15] in this present situation.
[2:04:18] Granted, Lord, may I be
[2:04:23] a chip off the old block,
[2:04:27] for you are the potter
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:37] and the clay.
[2:04:41] [Music]
[2:04:42] God know me and make
[2:04:47] me.
[2:04:49] [Music]
[2:04:50] This is what
[2:04:53] I pray.
[2:04:57] Oh, change my heart. Oh
[2:05:02] yes, Lord.
[2:05:04] Take out all the prickiness, Lord.
[2:05:08] Oh God, we don't want to be cactus,
[2:05:11] Lord. We want to be trees, Lord, where
[2:05:13] the leaves are not rolled up but
[2:05:15] blowing.
[2:05:17] Oh God, in the winds of Pentecost, Lord,
[2:05:21] fellowship, Lord God.
[2:05:24] Yes, Lord
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:31] are the part.
[2:05:34] You are the potter.
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:40] I'm the clay.
[2:05:47] [Music]
[2:05:50] Yes, Lord.
[2:05:52] This is how I pray.
[2:05:56] [Music]
[2:06:00] Change my heart, oh
[2:06:03] God.
[2:06:05] Yes, Lord.
[2:06:07] Make it end.
[2:06:11] In every situation,
[2:06:14] every moment, change my heart,
[2:06:18] oh God,
[2:06:23] may I be like
[2:06:27] you.
[2:06:29] Change my life. Change my life.
[2:06:34] Yes, Lord Jesus. Oh God, may your grace
[2:06:39] going with us, Lord.
[2:06:43] Oh God, may every bit of our will
[2:06:46] be melted, Lord.
[2:06:49] Not our will, but thy will be done,
[2:06:51] Lord.
[2:06:53] Melt away, Father, everything, Lord,
[2:06:55] that's unlike you.
[2:06:58] You
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:04] are the
[2:07:08] You are the father,
[2:07:12] Lord.
[2:07:14] I'm the clay. Yes, Lord.
[2:07:19] Mold me and make
[2:07:23] me.
[2:07:25] This is what
[2:07:29] is what I pray.
[2:07:34] Change my heart.
[2:07:38] Change my heart. Oh God.
[2:07:41] Make it ever
[2:07:45] make it ever true. Lord
[2:07:49] change.
[2:07:54] Oh,
[2:07:57] may I be
[2:08:00] like you,
[2:08:03] [Music]
[2:08:07] Lord? Prepare
[2:08:11] me
[2:08:14] to be a sanuary.
[2:08:21] Oh,
[2:08:23] pure
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:28] pure and holy
[2:08:31] tri.
[2:08:38] Oh, and with
[2:08:42] [Music]
[2:08:50] I want to be a living
[2:08:55] suary.
[2:08:56] [Music]
[2:09:03] Oh, for
[2:09:06] you,
[2:09:10] brother Brandham. Standing in the house
[2:09:11] when everything was tore upside down.
[2:09:13] You remember that time people were
[2:09:15] coming in and out. I got a word of the
[2:09:17] Lord to you, brother Brandham. You need
[2:09:19] to listen to me. If you don't listen to
[2:09:20] me, all that was going on in his house.
[2:09:22] The house was in turmoil.
[2:09:25] Sister Mey was all tore up. You remember
[2:09:27] the situation? There's a statement
[2:09:29] Brother Bram makes in there that to me
[2:09:30] is so powerful.
[2:09:32] And he says, "Lord,
[2:09:36] what would you have me to be in this
[2:09:39] situation?
[2:09:43] That's powerful."
[2:09:46] And you think of that and some of the
[2:09:47] examples tonight and I mentioned that
[2:09:50] just throwing that around about Zaku
[2:09:52] about finding Nemo. But do you realize I
[2:09:54] was looking at that and you know that
[2:09:56] the Lord spoke to my heart years and
[2:09:57] years ago and you know what the Lord
[2:09:59] did? He corrected me. Yeah.
[2:10:02] And to be honest with you, there's
[2:10:04] sometimes when you got a lot to say as a
[2:10:07] parent, parents, help me out. You know
[2:10:08] what I'm saying? There's a lot. And you
[2:10:09] think, hey,
[2:10:12] there's a whole corn field of correction
[2:10:14] here. But you know, I'm just telling you
[2:10:16] from my heart what I what I learned
[2:10:19] because I'm not perfect, but I'm just
[2:10:21] sharing with from my heart as God puts
[2:10:23] it on my heart. You know what I've had
[2:10:25] to ask the Lord? Lord, help me to be
[2:10:27] what you want me to be here. Lord, help
[2:10:28] me to look beyond. I know there's things
[2:10:30] that I could do this. I could say this.
[2:10:32] I could say this because you could say
[2:10:34] it all the time. Yeah. There's always
[2:10:36] things to correct. That's right. Right.
[2:10:38] That's right. But I've had to ask the
[2:10:39] Lord, Lord, help me. Sometimes, even
[2:10:41] while we're out for lunch, I'm just
[2:10:42] praying over my food, but I'm also
[2:10:43] praying, Lord, help me to know what to
[2:10:46] say at the right time. Sometimes it's
[2:10:48] not even anything that's said. It's just
[2:10:50] relationship. So, what I'm saying to you
[2:10:51] is is that the things tonight that God
[2:10:54] even brought to us in that way, do don't
[2:10:56] take it as though we're going to be like
[2:10:57] this. No, it's looking to him. It's
[2:11:01] looking to him. Lord, guide me. Help me
[2:11:02] to be what you want me to be in this
[2:11:05] situation. Don't you love the Lord?
[2:11:08] Amen.
[2:11:10] Oh, unto
[2:11:12] you. One more time as we're being
[2:11:15] dismissed.
[2:11:17] Oh Lord, prepare.
[2:11:19] [Music]
[2:11:21] Oh, we take this song with us as a
[2:11:23] prayer.
[2:11:29] Lord, move upon the needs of your
[2:11:31] children, Lord.
[2:11:37] Pure and holy,
[2:11:41] tried
[2:11:42] and true.
[2:11:45] [Applause]
[2:11:45] [Music]
[2:11:47] Oh,

[2:11:55] I'll be

[2:12:00] I want to be
[2:12:02] a living
[2:12:04] savior
[2:12:08] [Music]
[2:12:12] for
[2:12:15] you.
[2:12:16] [Music]
[2:12:24] Oh, yes it is, Lord. Amen. God bless you
[2:12:27] tonight.
[2:12:31] Who came to save
[2:12:36] my
[2:12:38] soul?
[2:12:40] [Music]
[2:12:53] [Music]
[2:12:56] And it's you, Lord,
[2:12:58] who knows
[2:13:00] my
[2:13:07] [Music]
[2:13:14] th
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:20] or prepare me. Oh Lord, prepare
[2:13:26] me
[2:13:29] for to be a sanctuary.
[2:13:32] [Applause]
[2:13:32] [Music]
[2:13:37] Oh, pure and holy.
[2:13:45] Oh, tried
[2:13:48] and true.
[2:13:50] [Music]
[2:13:53] Oh, and with thanksgiving,
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:00] Lord, I'll be
[2:14:03] a living.

[2:14:08] Oh, sanctuary.
[2:14:14] [Music]
[2:14:17] over
[2:14:20] you.
[2:14:22] Leave me alone.
[2:14:24] Oh, and lead me on,
[2:14:29] Lord.
[2:14:33] Oh, from temptation.
[2:14:41] Oh, pure
[2:14:46] me. Yes. Oh,
[2:14:49] oh, from
[2:14:51] within.
[2:14:56] Oh, fill my heart
[2:15:02] with
[2:15:05] your holy
[2:15:07] spirit.
[2:15:12] Oh, and take
[2:15:15] away.
[2:15:18] I'll take away
[2:15:21] all of my sins.
[2:15:26] Lord prepare me.
[2:15:29] Lord prepare
[2:15:33] me
[2:15:36] to be a sanctuary.
[2:15:45] Oh pure and
[2:15:49] holy.
[2:15:52] Oh, tried
[2:15:55] and true.
[2:16:00] Oh, and with thanksgiving,
[2:16:08] Lord, I want to be
[2:16:11] a living.
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:16] Oh sanctuary.
[2:16:18] [Applause]
[2:16:20] [Music]
[2:16:24] Oh for
[2:16:27] you.
[2:16:32] Lay that weight upon the Lord.
