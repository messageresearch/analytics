TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] my song this corner stone this side the ground firm through the fiercest drought and storm what heights of love what depths of peace when fears are still when striving cease [Music] comforter he's my all in all here in the love of christ i stand in christ alone who took on flesh fullness of god in helpless babe this gift of love and righteousness scorned by the ones he came to save till on their cross as jesus died the wrath of god was satisfied for every sin on him was laid here in the death of christ i lived amen there in the ground his body lays by darkness lane then bursting forth in glorious days from the grave again and as he stands in victory since curse has lost his grip on me for i am his and he is mine but with the precious blood of christ amen no guilt in life no fear in

lord that continues to lead us in an overcoming life lord i pray this morning no doubt lord there's many needs upon the hearts father we just ask that you would move in a very personal way i pray that god that you would just come this morning lord may the supernatural winds of the holy ghost just blow upon these waters lord i pray may you come o god move down lord as you did for the man who was laying there that day who said i can't get there but you came to him boy i prayed dear god may the same angel of the lord just move here this morning lord once again lord god we have not gathered here to be seen we've come to hear from you lord there are needs lord jesus in our lives lord to lord to be spoken to lord to be dealt with to be helped lord to be delivered lord to be filled o god lord yuri you become all things to every need o god we just ask the lord that you would just become this morning lord god become to whatever the need is in that life lord may you reveal yourself as the all-sufficient one we pray dear god we just ask that you just move now ministering lord to our hearts help me to get out of the way lord i need you this morning to oh god just to be able to step aside in the congregation as well that you might have the right away lord god [Music] you're the one who comes visible but for us that's your voice that we hear lord we ask these things for the glory of god the name of jesus christ [Music] amen god bless you as you turn in the bibles to first john chapter four i want to say it's so good to be in the house of the lord glad to be gathered together permit us i want you to remember i i don't know if the prayer request was in but because remember brother ray hernandez he has surgery here this coming week for the three places there in his shoulder arm all those areas right there and it was a real miracle that even that you know as i mentioned to you before it was a miracle that he he was able to get that surgery everything through workers comp and thing because there's different others who's been in the company for a number of years and they've never even though they needed something they have not been able to get it so god has certainly worked on the behalf of our brother and we just want to remember him in prayer that's on wednesday so please keep that in prayer also as we mentioned sister sister crest that the lord will just continue to strengthen her and touch her she's recovering from her surgery and also uh sister michelle the family that's there they need continue to need your prayers the lord would comfort them and many times there's things that take place so we don't understand it but we just we committed into the hands of god and we ask god for strength that the lord will just minister because they'll need it not only in the coming days here in this week but there's also days ahead of them i think there's a thing that you know when we prayed about it i just think of the little boy sister michelle's sister there had a little boy who was nine years old is that right sister michelle nine are going to be ten so he's in that in that journey just such a care and relationship that you know he had with his mom just to try to keep her because there's certain things that she dealt with physically and we're gonna do this tomorrow mama we're going to do this and we're going to do that and i don't say that to you to make you sad but i say it that that just would enter in in prayer that god would bring comfort and god would bring leadership in that situation amen so let's just really let's take that upon our hearts and pray with them amen first john chapter 4 and verse 13 hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world now i want you to think of this as we read this here this morning john is not writing this in a manner of a historical account he's dealing with it he opens the very first part of this the these scriptures is the word of life that we have seen we have handled and we declare unto you just as our fellowship is with the father that that same fellowship that there may be that same fellowship among us to enter into that so it's not something of history that was done but what god did the same god is present to make known i did what needed to be done are you with me when mo when abraham went to the mountain in genesis 22 and he spoke remember the word being declared the ram came on the scene that was the same ram that was back in genesis 15. it was the same original atonement but now the word had brought that living atonement that same god was now on the scene to manifest his word so it was not a historical account it was the same god that was standing there present to perform the word that was in abraham's heart okay and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he and god now we know what confession is confession is is not just with our mouth the bible says confession is made from with from from the heart from the mouth but we know the confession itself that there is a depth within that that that confession comes to where it is our life that gives a confession a testimony there's a voice within this blood that speaks so whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he and god and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us that's personal that's personal god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him may the lord add his blessing to the word as you're being seated i like that we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him you see god's desire as john would write here was to so make that love known to that of adam's fallen race that god himself not only wrote about it but god in his love he came down to manifest his love by becoming one of us and taking our our sins upon himself and paying that price that then he might send back the holy ghost the love of god into our hearts that would it would respond to the call that has been made you see in order for this this as we were speaking this this love it must be a channel that whereby god is able to express this love in such a in such a manner in a way that it brings a transformation it brings indeed what what the love of god is it brings the result you see the scripture tells us in the book of ephesians that our choosing we were chosen in god in christ before the foundation of the world we were chosen as the bible would go on to say to be holy without blame before him in love that there are spiritual blessings that are poured out within within this place that belongs to us as believers this was this was all done in love and so when we when i look at this and just thinking of it brother branham would say it like this and i just want to refer to these places you can just listen he said god is a lover god is love and god so loved the world when they were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable now i want you to think about that we were unlovable we could do nothing in ourselves to make ourselves lovable but god provided for you and i that we might become lovable it's his work it's what he has done it's what he is doing you see this is why it's just such a we can really preach on this this is why here within this scripture you think of where john would write that if god so loved us we ought to love one another and paul would write in first thessalonians he said beloved he said you need no man to teach you to love one another you are talk of god because when we were unlovable god came to us and he made us lovable now he didn't compromise with us but he came to declare and pick out what was really laying there in our life his his word did not come to highlight all of the unlovableness but his word when his word comes it's just a it's a process of it when the word is come it's light light shows darkness but you see when it shows darkness also light is showing there's a pathway out of that darkness it reveals those things that have a hold and it loosens that whole that's what the love of god it comes to do oh my so here as brother brown would go on to say it says he when they were unlovable that he came he gave his son to make them lovable god wants to come down and make love to you he's seeking look at these words he's seeking thirsting hungering and trying to get to some of your starchy hearts to make love to you as a love affair not a law but a love it's only love god so loved so this is one of the the qualities if we can just begin to look at it just a little bit here within the scripture we we recognize god's desire that we that we would walk in line with the word but remember that god's desire and how that it would be laid out here in the word that it comes to bring us into a relationship with him personally it comes to restore what rightfully belongs to the sons and daughters of god you find in one place of the scripture of what we're looking at tonight or this morning it deals with us as sons and daughters of god in that relationship that he is our father then we find in the word that when it comes into that word that is coming forth then it identifies the relationship as a husband and a wife becoming one so the word itself the love of god it calls for a relationship let me just say it personally the word preached in the trueness through the channel of inspiration in this hour does not read reveal jesus christ wanting to be a boyfriend it reveals jesus christ that he wants to be the husband and the lord of your life that he wants to declare himself that i am your father and you are my attributes you are my offspring so we know that any attribute or any offspring it will bear within it the characteristics of of the father itself now you think of this brother and i'm just going to read a few of these places he says when god seen the sin of this world and seen that men was dying without hope and could not be saved yet he knowed that men would love him it strained god and it proved his nature god's nature is love god is love and it strained god's nature until he had to provide a way of escape for those who wanted to escape he sent his son into the world and made in the likeness of sinful flesh to bear our sins and sickness to calvary god did it the love of god going out called for sovereign grace he said now god never said if you'll do this if you'll do this i'll do this he said god without any conditions he sent his son to die in your place and settle the sin question had nothing to do with what you think about it god did it anyhow you see divine love put a strain sovereign grace has to take his place that's all there is when divine love is set at the right place you see if it would have been left up to you and i even though within our lives as brother branham said here god knew there would be those how they would love him but there was no strength the bible says when we were in due time without strength and to thank god knowing you and i we would not even have the confidence to be able to even lift our head we would not even have that part about us to be able to even look is there a way back but god himself knowing that there would be a desire within the sons and daughters of god to come back home because that's where they belong in him then he himself is the one who would make a way he would confirm that way and he would reveal that way and let me tell you something him doing that his presence his life his nature is accompanied with that word to bring about a faith and to energize our hearts in what love is calling for grace steps in and says i will bring to pass what love is calling for amen in the book of deuteronomy when god would speak to the children of israel when he had brought them out this is a book very important because remember they had fallen in the wilderness many of them had been overthrown they looked at the giants they become discouraged and god would take through the book of deuteronomy he would let them know the seriousness of abiding in the word he would let him know that there's a blessing if you abide in this word there is protection there god god is letting them know in deuteronomy i have everything covered i'm all that you have need of and god would even take provisions in the book of deuteronomy to encourage the people of god god would lead them even into battles that prior to them crossing the jordan they would take on all the king of bashan they would deal with different ones like that why there were battles in order to build their faith as they would come in the land it's no different what god has done with your life and with my life even when god gets a hold of a life and god begins to work what's happening there are battles that are being won and god is building faith in the hearts of his children there is not a church that can do that there's not a man that can do that but that is god himself stepping up and taking responsibility for his word and his children that are on earth in this hour it's god who moves to stir you and i into battle and to stand there on the word and say god is faithful he would remind him in the book of deuteronomy oh i got to read this in deuteronomy 7 6 for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god had chosen thee to be a special people give me a little more up here please unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people or you were the fewest of all people in other words god didn't look at you and say man they're greater than any other people in the earth neither did god look down and say oh they're so sorry and so sad let me just tell you something the gospel does not come it's not a work of pity you see a work of pity is somebody's trying to pity you for something that they can't help you with god's letting them know i didn't choose you because you were able neither did i choose you because you lacked ability i chose you because there's a covenant that i had in mind you know what he's letting him know you got nothing to do with this this is my choosing oh glory when we can rest in that it allows us to step back and allows him to step forward the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt god is reminding them that it was it was me standing with the oath of the word that i gave to my people now i want you to think of this here very very simple brother brown would pick this up here and i i want to read these parts out of divine love he said you know he talks about this possum that comes up now many of you have heard this story if not all of you but brother branham here he is he's standing in his in his house and he's getting ready now to go outside it's daylight and he walks he sees what's coming up the walkway it came through his gate it come through the gate to come in right up the hat right up the the pathway brother graham sees this possum now he knows brother brad knows enough about nature that this is awful strange because opossum is blind in the daylight are you with me and so as the possum comes up he knows there's something going on and he looks and he sees the condition of that possum it had maggots all over it billy graham said he couldn't even walk right its leg he said whether whether a dog had got a hold of it or whether a car had got a hold of it and hear it come walking right up there at that time now here's what brother brown tells us here let me just let me just slow it here he says now he said think of the gumption here of that of that of that possum she had gumption look at this she had gumption enough to follow the leading of the spirit if god could send a possum by divine grace and love to protect her babies how much more will he think of you and me tonight if you'll give if we'll give him our whole heart of love our surrendered will everything to him he will project to us his sovereign grace will have to take place and he'll if you'll give him that love well how can i give him the love that he's requiring he's manifesting the love that he has towards you that's what the word itself comes to do you see it's not a historical account many can look back to calvary and they can look back to it it's ministered it's preached but it's not a historical account it's something to be made and brought present and to realize if he went to calvary and he paid the price and then he sent back the holy ghost there is a reason that he did what he did his desire was to be united with me to change my life not that i would just look upon him and have a good thought about him i would get warm fuzzy feelings but that they would actually come forth the life in that blood cell that was needed in order to change my life how can that be the love of god must be manifested now i want you to think of this he says now think of it here let me go on and read this he said thank oh oh god may the center man boy woman or girl who has been divinely led to this place of worship tonight let them know right now that it is your spirit that has led them here for no other purpose but to come and serve you oh he said speak to their hearts just now may they send forth from their heart the divine love of god in appreciations of you leading them here notice may they send forth from their heart the divine love of god for the appreciations of you sending them here that's what i want to do don't you i do receive that of the love of god and notice how can you how in you how in the world could you and i do this it would have to be that the divine love of god is expressed in its death you see this is why the word when it has been preached down through the ages it is not a word that just leaves us in a manner of love on the filial realm because people can love god in their spirit they can love his word they can love a lot of those things love church love that but yet they really don't love god down in their soul when the love of god has come down in the soul it reflects itself within that life well how in the world can it ever come to be first of all it's to be ordained for that and then it will require the same word that love manifested to you and i through a designated dedicated ordained channel of god for the inspiration of god to flow through in that hour is that right now notice may they send forth from their heart the divine love of god in appreciations of you leading them here and sovereign grace will send a message back the saving message of the lord thy sins may be a scarlet now they are white as snow granite father we ask it in the name of jesus christ he goes on what caused you mr or mrs to come to the meeting tonight it was the same god that stopped the animals in the field it's the same one look how he brings this it's the same one who led the old mother possum who's done all the things that's love god so loved you that he led you to a place where you could accept him oh he said will you do it upon the basis of the shed blood of his beloved son god could do nothing else his great love constrained him in such a way that he could not do anything else he sent you a savior and if you're loved look at this if your love to god will be the same way that his love was to send jesus your love will draw jesus to you and you can be saved so it's to receive that love not reason with it not that's this is not that love that love that will come out here that's in that affection gay this is not that love that operates in the gate of affection this is the divine love the highest of all it is that of agape love can a man get there no a man must be brought there by god himself but that is where you and i are ordained to or ordained to live this is where as a son and daughter of god by the baptism of the holy ghost we live holy without blame before him in love does it mean that we won't make mistakes that's not what it's saying at all but our soul is dwelling in the blood covenant our life has been changed and there is a perfection within our life we are standing before him in i love know about you but there's something i discovered i got turned around here about that possum the other day in prayer you know sometimes you listen you're listening listen and listen listen listen listen and i begin to think about that and i you know when i look at how that brother browner had different ones who were around and they looked at that possum sister woods was one of them she looked at that blossom and they seemed the condition that possum was in remember it couldn't even walk right it had maggots on it brother branham put a rake over because he didn't know what was wrong with him and you had different ones telling brother randall go ahead and kill it you got to kill it and it's got babies you got to kill it that listen that's the most humane sensible thing to do and brother branham said looking at it he says i can't do that he says i'm a hunter i ain't a killer he begins to look at it and he says you know he said truly it would have been the right humane thing to do it would have been the sensible thing to do he said but there was something down in me that wouldn't let me do it let me tell you something god would have smoked the earth with a curse but god had a promise in his word my brother and sister god would have wiped this whole thing out but the mercy of god in this hour an age of darkness an isle of violence you and i may be broken parts in our lives walking around covered over with the maggots of the world but god himself who is rich in mercy said let me have that life i can take that life i can change it i'll transform it into a trophy of my grace hallelujah he did not it was not the possum that brought herself there she followed the leading of the lord and of a dumb animal can just be simple enough to follow the leading of the lord right now oh god help me to be dumb enough the bible would say behold what manner of love that the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god it didn't ask if you wanted to be called the son of god or a daughter of god matter of fact god didn't even ask you if you want to be a son or a daughter of god did any of you ask did you did any of you did your mom and dad ask you if you wanted to be born did they god didn't ask you if you wanted to be a son and daughter of god it was not something that god had to consult with you it was already a decision it's what was already in him it was what was already in him but now god comes to confirm that word well how's he going to confirm that word he cannot call you by anything less than what he knows you to be you may never have seen yourself as the son and daughter of god and truth be known we're coming more and more into that place denying our own thoughts our own feelings we come more into that solid ground of the sacred sands of god's grace where we stand and say lord i just rest in the work that you've done in my life i don't try to reason it put my mind there i rest in what you have done that is the sure grounds of reality where the spirit of god comes upon the seed to quicken that life he called us sons and daughters of god are you with me it has to be a word that goes out to let us know who we are has to let us know who we are and what we are called to this is why when paul would write there in second corinthians and it'd be such a pivotal pivotal scripture there even in in the bible wherein that god himself as paul would declare he has made us ministers of righteousness he has made us as paul would say able ministers able by what abel by his spirit endued with the holy spirit that same word that god has given that it's not the man's word it's not a man's words that's changing us let me just say it like this god in this hour friends for the need and what was called for it was not enough just to give you and i just just you know what had already been going on but god in this hour in order for there to be a union and to come back for the church would come back into a full maturity into a true word birth god needed a designated channel now listen to me he's needed a designated channel down through the ages when you read in the book of revelations let he that hath and ear to heal not them he that hath an ear to hear because god will have a trumpet that will sound out and will actually sound forth the message and there are those who are ordained to hear the voice of god and they respond to that call so god in this hour the call is for the manifestation of the sons of god god would have to have a vessel or a life because here is the position of the word that would be so inclined with god to wear the very words that would be spoken heaven itself would echo back the same words that were spoken on earth is that right that's revelations 12. it would be spoken and echoed back because this is the word of the homeland this is where the children of god are called into a full maturity in this hour you understand we're not called just to justification just to believe in the resurrection of the lord jesus christ with we are that plus we're not called just to suggest to sanctification it's not called just to that of the baptism of the holy ghost with the gifts it's called to the very indwelling the token itself of that personal life of jesus christ dwelling within the body amen so now when we look at this god himself has made abel ministers so it's not it's not the men it wasn't it's not brother branham's words it's god's words that he spoke it's not the men as far as our words that spoke matter of fact we have no other message to proclaim we stand upon that word that god has already vindicated with his presence are you with me and to thank the power of this word when god would begin to reveal this to the prophet brother branham would sit out there in the woods and he goes through this and speak to this mountain in los angeles california he speaks of how that god began to deal with his heart and brother branham was looking there and he thought my goodness you know here come the first squirrel when that squirrel was spoken here that squirrel came out but he said i wanted to just see he said i thought i'm going to take a place where there ain't no way a squirrel will come out of a squirrel itself would not live in this type of a condition a certain tree and certain things like that and he spoke by the authority of god's word and he said there'll be a squirrel come out right over there i remember the kind of tree bush and everything like that squirrels do not live in those kind of places but you see what the word spoken in authority it would speak forth those things which the rest could say ain't no way ain't no impossible let me bring it down to our life you might as well forget about their life any human sensible thing just go ahead and get rid of them they'll never overcome they'll never be victorious but there's a word that went for brother because out of our life there has been a son and daughter of god oh it might have been so black it might have been so marred there might be so many things about our life and everybody would have wrote us off but god said i can't write you off of the poems of my hand you are there in my mind you're part of my dreams and the word went forth and here you come now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty amen we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so there's a liberty the spirit of god ringing out within his word it's a liberty the love of god it rings out in liberty brother branham would take this and i've read this quote to you many many times and he would deal with here in the message shalom how the spirit of god the pillar fire moving amongst the people and he would speak and say we're so happy for this privilege that we can thank in our hearts that we are sons and daughters of yours to see you strictly identify yourself in the midst of us that you are our father changing our thoughts from the things of the world where's he dealing soul he's the one identifying himself that he's our father now you knew however you had come in here whether at any time but you see god himself begins to deal with the thoughts begins to deal with what is already down there in the soul remember he's trying to get that first nature and that spirit to agree with him he's changing our thoughts from the things of the world hey listen there's many of you sitting right here that there's things that you could have went back a year ago two years ago and other things you didn't have the thoughts that you've got right now you didn't even have even to even be inclined in that way to even entertain that of what god was doing there was but god himself moving god moving by way of his word changing our thoughts from the things of the world changing our motives and objectives and attitudes and every phase of us to love you to believe you and know that your promises are true you know god has always he's always been hidden and he'd reveal he reveals himself in very odd peculiar ways the bible tells us here in john 14 15 if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever notice if you love me even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him so without seeing him it can never receive him so he must manifest himself his love his word and when that is made manifest as he is dealing with the heart in the spirit of truth that is god himself taking his word and he is unfolding himself and speaking to our hearts it's not just a word it's not a lesson but it's god dealing personally with our hearts but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you he says i will not leave you comfortless i'll come to you or what an assurance yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i and you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be love of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him this is a love affair amen he will never he'll never come and reveal himself without love but in order for that love to be he reveals himself in love you realize even when god as god would come around and as we said when the light is expressed light will show up darkness light will show up error light will show up those things that which is hindrance what's that light coming to do it's coming to press back the darkness that the seed that is there on the inside might come forth under the authority of the light and bear the image of that which it always truly was he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him judah said unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thou self thyself unto us and not unto the world and jesus said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and he will come unto him and make we will come unto him and make our abode with him that's very key because the holy spirit the real the new birth is not a moving on and a leaving way not a moving on and leaving away but he comes to abide he comes to abide in a place that welcomes him for who he is so this is why he cannot come by the way of the new birth where the word is not preached are you hearing me it takes that of the word that actually it reveals his characteristics to be the same it's the word has god is ministering that word he's working on our life he don't even ask you and how to figure it out god just asked you and i to believe it god don't even ask you to look at your life and say i can't say a man to there uh you know boy i still got this on my life say amen to the word if it's the word you're not saying amen to yourself you're saying amen to the word amen means so be it hallelujah you stand there upon that word when it's coming forth what are you doing you're keeping which means to attend carefully to what he is speaking to your heart it invites him you attend to it carefully be it unto me according to that word you give yourself to that word as the word is coming forth don't try to figure it out don't even try to set steps for yourself three ways to be a better me god don't want you doing that he wants us just to accept his word to attend to it carefully how do i tend to the word carefully give your heart to the word and let god come and perform his word that goes for everybody that's in here just attend to the word just say amen to the word you say so be it to the word listen we're not hearing a pep rally we're here as sons and daughters of god amen we are hearing a word from our homeland this message is sounding on earth what was echoed in heaven there's a people on earth that are inclined with god just as the messenger was [Music] there's a people on earth where the word has been born into existence in their life hallelujah glory be to god it's a word that heaven stands behind hallelujah hold that little policeman brother ram said he stands out in the middle of the street he puts up his hand he said he don't have enough power to stop a runaway pony but it ain't his strength he's got an authority that badger believer that badger believer says when i stand out there and the hand is thrown up they've got to stop it's not stopping because of who we are is stopping because of who we represent [Applause] hallelujah [Music] glory be to god take that devil [Applause] that's the truth friends we're making no peace treaty and no pacts with the devil if he's tried to come on your land this morning you serve him an eviction notice get out of here in the name of jesus christ hallelujah you say what do i do you start moving by way of the word god will show you that ox gold come on somebody you start moving getting into that of the current of the word god will show you just what you need and it won't be you doing it it'll be him that is inspiring you and energizing you you understand what i'm saying i'm not asking if you feel worthy or not i'm speaking of him who is the worthy one and he's letting you know who you are that's why the spirit of god could move down through the prophet and say satan has tried to tell you that you're some trodden down good for nothing group of people but you are the sons and daughters of the living gods he that hallelujah me not keepeth not my sins just disregards them and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me now you see it's a blessing when we hear as jesus said you keep my commandments these are the sayings of god as he said here right there at the last part if he keepeth not my sayings jesus never come to add new commandments even though he could say a new commandment i give unto you because you see now the one who gave the law the one who had who is the word himself now that could be declared in that hour that you love one another even as i've loved you that would that would not be possible without the coming of the holy ghost so you see the word that is declared in that hour there's no way that that word can come to pass even in the hearts and lives of the people without the holy ghost coming down to quicken that word and to bring it to pass so if god is speaking are you hearing me then the god who is speaking is there to fulfill it amen and this is where we look in the scriptures there's a blessing in the commandments of god there's a blessing with keeping the word so as a children of god and sons and daughters of god we truly couldn't be sons and daughters of god if we don't if we don't value the word you see the bible gives forth whoever adds to the word or takes from it his part will be taken out of the book of life so god god won't stand for any additives nor will he stand for for any deductions it's got to be the full word that's why the spirit of truth has come notice in revelations 22 14 blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into that city now the bible goes on and tells us let me go back to the beginning in revelation revelations 1 verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that read it and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand so that revelation of jesus christ it is given personally between god and the believer god will sound forth as it says here also in revelations 22 i jesus has sent my angel into the churches to testify of these things it's the same holy ghost the same jesus that has testified of his word down through the ages is that right but now in this time in this hour he comes in his fullness because now once again there is a bride that a bride now standing and coming into a full maturity back as it was there on the day of pentecost so now the alpha has become the omega this is why in that part of the scripture let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come it had not come before that but now here comes the announcement on earth see it was a written word but now the time is at hand and the word sounds forth it's not a preacher quoting a scripture it's god standing there god with skin on it's god sounding out the word it's god speaking to our hearts let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come [Applause] and his wife she had made herself ready how she took what he said and she attended to it carefully she gave herself she gives herself to this word she is dressed in the garments of the word you do not look upon the bride and say oh you must be baptist nope she doesn't have that name that speaks of adultery oh you must be pentecostal no not by denomination but as far as experience yes are you hearing me you see she comes back to reveal or to manifest that name listen friends i don't say those things lightly or to look down there are people out in there not being part of the bride unless unless they come in through a bright message but there will be lives who will be saved but they will not be part of the rapture the rapture is for the elect of god and the word of god the love of god sounds to their heart to call them to this degree think of it that you think how how long or how far would i get by preaching a gospel like this if i went down the road to one of these churches i could have opened up with them maybe the first few minutes and they'd have kicked me out is that right i don't care you can go down through many of the churches they would have went right ahead and put me out not because that i'm here again arrogant or but it's the word of god what the word is calling our lives to it's the word that sounds out to our lives it doesn't listen we don't look down on anybody else if it doesn't mean anything to them that's fine go on you can't be anything that god has made you but if there's a call in your heart to go across jordan there's a longing in your heart brother there is a deed that calls to the deep there is a word there is a god on the scene who's there to meet and minister to that need and release to you and i what we have need of the time is at hand so that word the word can only be revealed in its season oh my let me read these scriptures here to you in psalms 103 verse 20 ah hallelujah bless the lord it's speaking of the value of heeding to his word bless the lord ye his angels speaking of ministers his messengers that excel in strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word psalms 112 verse 1 praise ye the lord blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments notice feareth the lord in reality that's departed from this earth and i ask you to be very to think very deeply even among religious people the fear of the lord the spirit of god wrote about this in timothy through paul that was an in-kind end-time condition judes wrote about it too they think nothing to speak evil of dignitaries are you with me you see because you you tear down one person in authority you tear down everybody are you hearing me if you speak against any this is the word of god this is why even when you take those who were in the days of elisha and elisha even though when he called those she bears out that wasn't the spirit of god that was an angry prophet but what i want to deal with here and just to think as it comes to my heart remember those those boys they came out there those children and said old ball head are you going to go up there like elijah where did they hear such talking like that in their homes you see your children learn to fear god according to how you fear god if you don't fear god they won't fear god at all either if you don't respect authority they won't respect authority either you see it's how you train them and you teach them it's how oh my i don't know how we got on this can of worms but you see it's it's something that all of a sudden we wonder how did it get in the situation it is but this is the blessing if we fear the lord reverence him it in that we have to understand it even sometimes when we look at him and say oh that's hard but yet within our heart we say lord that's your word i want to line up with that lord blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments i love this his seed shall be mighty upon earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed well we can preach that of the lord jesus christ and sons and daughters of god the seed being mighty aren't you glad for a word that's come forth in this hour aren't you thankful think about it now look at this when abraham he met melchizedek when levi is is recorded as though levi paid ties unto melchizedek you see he was there in the loins of abraham when it came time for his time he manifested in that hour the same way that his father did because he was there he was represented of how that a son of abraham would respond when the word come forth glory be to god and listen brother sister we were in the loins of god's mind when god became flesh we were transferred down to the loins of jesus we went to calvary with him we died with him and we got up on that easter morning when he got up there is an authority that reigns out in our life oh because one that stood faithful there is one who stood on our behalf now that same life is released back into you and i who fear the lord delight greatly in his commandments and it is his strength his strength mighty is his seed in the earth it's his life it's a token it's his life that comes to you and i it's what's ministered to you and i the life of what sin of what satan had deceived taken there in the beginning adam walked out willfully in disobedience to save his wife i hear god comes back and god provides you and i with a with a true token by his divine love now let me read this to you here just really tune in here he says the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and it's been accepted you can't get the token from the railroad fair until you pay the price the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it he says what believe it accept it full obedience to the whole word of god will entitle you to the token amen what do i do first believe it accept it hallelujah full obedience to the whole word of god will entitle you to the token full obedience not the part of it as far as your denomination goes but all full obedience to the word which is christ brings you into christ now what if you was just all in but your feet hanging out one of you was all in with your hands hanging out most all of us in but the heart hanging out the hearts in the world yet but we don't want to do that full complete obedience puts you and the word one you believe it every bit of it and all of it's in you and you watch it working through you now maybe there you know we can't relate as far as train fare maybe some of you have rode a train but you know how it is you ride in an automobile or a plane or a bus you can't just go on that bus and say here here's here's my 500 now let me on this airplane you wouldn't even get you would not nowadays you won't even get through security you won't even be able to check your bags through to get to any place in that airport you've got to have your ticket and you've got to have your identification are you with me certain countries you go to they'll ask you for it a whole lot more yeah china i was afraid they were going to rub my picture off you can't get anywhere without it but you can't get on the plane or the train without it but you there is a way to purchase that fare is that right now let me ask you something when you go to purchase a plane ticket you know how it is when you go places sometimes you especially if you know you're going somewhere ahead of time i i like i like to know far ahead as i can plan because why you get a better price on the ticket is that right so it's the same way with a train or whatever more but you see there have been some times where all of a sudden you know i got a call and maybe it's only a month away a month and a half and and i had that maybe that that part was open on that month i had nowhere there was nowhere else i was to go and i look there and i think oh my goodness here this plane ticket this plane ticket for me to fly to to wherever this plane ticket's going to cost me 500 some dollars maybe 700 to fly from here to there or whatever more i'm talking places that i there ain't no way i'm going to drive you understand so when you look at you say well why why would that even be purchased within that way you see it's whether or not you value it there's a part of it that you could look at and say ain't no way in the world i'll just take mountain dew and i'll drive two days straight well i'm trying to be i'm trying to be some account when i get there are you with me what i'm telling you is it depends on what you value you can't when you purchase that ticket and the money you put down you're saying i value this to go ahead and to purchase that ticket and once you got the ticket hey it's good you're going to make that flight you got to be there on time you're there and they'll send you updates they let you know signs are creeping up on us they give you little updates let you know so much until you need to be at the gate departure is this amount of time they're letting you know because why you've already purchased the ticket you're getting updates that it's getting time for departure they start asking you a question do you want to go ahead and get your baggage checked in is that right they'll begin to ask you those questions why because the fair has already been paid and you have the token the token we're talking about is the baptism of the holy ghost what is the fair that's required faith faith to simply believe it and accept it and yield to that brother that's the purchasing power my this is why when the scriptures had the scriptures there what it would express here let me just move ahead to think of how that the bible would talk about that there were those there in the book of acts and they would speak of how that when they the word would come to them in acts 17 11 they were more noble than those in thessalonica they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so therefore many of them believed also honorable women which were greeks and a men not a few first thessalonians 2 verse 13 for this cause also think we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe hallelujah not as a word of man but as a word of almighty god you see this what is happening it's the spirit of god that begins to move into that word and what's he doing brother sister do you realize it goes many times it'll bypass our mind begins to look at that and say you know that ain't nothing but the truth and here it don't matter what kind of a condition that you are setting in when the word begin to speak and god begins to turn your heart there's a part there and that mind says this is absolutely the truth what's he doing it's beginning to line up with that word and you're beginning to recognize this is not the word of a man a word of a man cannot answer the questions on my heart it cannot speak to the depth in my life this man don't even know me but you begin to recognize it's god and it moves in a manner of a love affair and you're receiving that word into your life what's happening you allow that word when you receive it as the truth you accept it you believe it what does it do it effectually works in your life [Music] you begin to agree with the word as you agree with the word it invites the word to come oh glory look at this scripture i want to just just just closing out on this part of it what i just read to you brother brown makes that same statement and each of the token message is full obedience full obedience to the word of god entitles you to the token in acts 5 32 peter and the rest speaking here the word we are his witnesses of these things and so also is the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him this word obey it means to submit and to yield to take a life that could sit right here and god deals with that life and they could look in their life and there may be all sorts of things in their house in their home it might have been all sorts of things they'd done before even coming here let's say oh my you mean i got to go out of here man i got to go out here and i got to do this and i got to do that and i got to do that lord i want i want your life more than anything what god's looking for is full obedience because you see a person can let's say if it's supposed to get rid of this a person can do that but if they don't do it from here amen it'll come right back if they don't do it because of him and they're falling in love with him it'll come right back but full obedience is where the spirit of god can move into a life oh my it might have been a life that oh my it could be so many different things about it but in a moment's time the spirit of god can so move down in that light not only not only have they opened their heart to receive him as their lord their savior how he'll move right in clean their life up and he'll set right down in their life why full obedience to the word by the time you mean that can happen even before a person is baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ well i'm preaching that name but remember in the book of acts when they heard the word preached the holy ghost fell is that right and then they rose up and were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ what we're talking about is full obedience is where the heart is moved by god into that place and god does that song amen think about saul here with saul he had it right here with samuel samuel gave him the word to go into battle and to defeat the amalekites now the amalekites themselves remember what they represent they represent that of the flesh it will be something which god will take that battle up in every generation god comes forward to meet the challenge of amalek our first nature in every generation and here god comes to saul and he tells saul don't keep nothing he said i want you to get rid of every one of the sheep oxen and everything else and i want you to get rid of the king i want you i don't want you to leave one of them alive you see in every generation you'll look at this in the scripture you find that how that in every generation it would say well david wiped out the amalekites or david you know how that he stood against them you'll find down through the ages then you look and say well my here they are standing against the amalekites at that time that was a type of how that god would bring a word and that word would deal with the amalekites in that generation but um but until the fullness or the time of full redemption to where eventually it's completely done away with god comes to deal with it now here god gives saul the word he tells saul saul go take care of all of it but saul goes up there and he starts feeling sorry he feels sorry for different ones and you know the people this one saul this is this would be a good offering to god this would be so wonderful saul saul you should we should keep this and everything is just working in a manner that ain't real love that ain't love at all but the real love of god is to keep his word even when it goes against the grain of our flesh but here saul comes back into the camp and samuel says what is that bleeding i what is that that i hear there were things that he brought with him back from amalek that he should never have brought and he wanted to bring that in and he said i've obeyed the word of the lord but he didn't obey it he obeyed what he thought was enough or what was the word of the lord but it wasn't the word of the lord think of what took place god told him you've rejected the word and because of that the kingdom was rent from his life given to david i'd say it in this manner when the spirit of god i don't know where maybe you might be this morning but obey all the word of god don't try to figure it out don't try to reason it out don't try to look at this or that just just from your heart say lord i want to be in full obedience to the word of god i just want to be in full obedience i i don't want to try to make my own way i don't want to have to try to well you know i've got this lamb right here in my life and and you know there's there's a quote about this lamb or this bullet no no no we want to be able to return back where there's no sound of the world amen are you with me where there's no sound of the world coming out the only thing that comes out is holy holy holy unto the lord amen not well lord i think you'll accept this but we want holiness unto the lord you see the words inspired the word as it comes to you and i it's inspired yes we've been dealing with this the love of god it comes to us it's inspired think of elijah and i close right here here was a people israel they were stooped in idolatry they were professing to serve god and here they had offerings unto bow elijah was led by god and he came there to the mountain you remember the story all the all those about they go ahead and go over the time of the evening sacrifice typing the day that we're living here the evening time elijah drew near to the altar elijah enters into prayer with god and he begins as he prays he enters in and he says lord i've done all this according to thy word elijah was not there under enthusiasm there's no doubt about it elijah it made him sick the way things were going in israel it it it any child of god it would are you with me brother brandon i think how brother brown was sitting there and he tells about it in divine love he was sitting in the restaurant one day he said man why does this music so bother me what is it he said the spirit of god come back and said if it don't bother you something's wrong are you with me brother i'm so hot god i don't want to get adjusted to this world i sure don't want to get adjusted to it but i've done all this elijah said according to thy word what was it god had given inspired word to elijah elijah was a channel that was designated to god and elijah could stand there he knew what the people had need of they had need just to see the same living god the same one that had come down and moved in the beginning the same god that had brought him out of egypt the same god that had parted the waters the same god who part of the jordan the same god who took down the walls of jericho they just needed to see the same god and here's where he stands listen to this when elijah prays he said oh lord god of abraham isaac not jacob israel you see there was a word that could deal with the condemnation there was a word that could deal with the sin and where they were at there was a word in that time that could deal with it and he said let it be known that i'm your servant and that these are thy people o god and that thou hast turn their heart there had nothing been done yet but in the mind of god the hearts had already been turned all it would take is a living god coming on the when scene happened remember the commandment they said the lord he is god the lord he is god they fell down and they worship they recognized his presence and elijah said take the prophets of them and don't you let one of them escape right you get every one of them and you bring them right down here to the brook and every one of those prophets were slaughtered you know why they're the very ones that have been leading israel in the way they have been leading them they were leading israel and they were under condemnation they were under judgment but the mercy of god stepped in in the evening time and god manifested his love to israel you let them know you're my israel you're my sons and daughters that's what god lets you and i know you see the word it comes to draw upon our hearts god comes to make himself known to our lives our lives are inclined to god you see friends it's a love affair i'm speaking i'm speaking here these even when you look in your life maybe some of you you're sitting
