Given all [music] my sin, the Holy [singing] Ghost within. I love that [music] man from Galilee. [singing] Oh, I love that man from [music] Galilee. For he's done so very much for me.

Let's just go to him in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, how how thankful we are, Lord, for this moment. We're very thankful, dear God, for the real meaning of this time, this season. Lord, we're so thankful, dear God, that you came down to become one of us. That's the That's the beginning right there, Lord, that would bring about the pathway, Lord, that we can come into full fellowship with you. How we're so thankful, dear God. We so appreciate, Lord, your mercies, Lord. And father, as the words of that song has said, Lord, not only would our requests be that the word would be born in our hearts, but Lord, may we grow, &gt;&gt; may that life within us grow, &gt;&gt; Lord, as we would yield and surrender, oh God, give us the grace, Lord, to know how to apply the word to our lives. But Lord, we can see Lord that which is truth and you will direct us to be able to see those things. But oh God, how we need &gt;&gt; the discernment in every situation for Lord, we want to be overcomers, &gt;&gt; oh God, and we know that Lord, it's the overcoming by your life that dwells within us, Lord. And then through there, Lord God, every battle that we face, the submitting, the emptying out of our lives and the submitting, Lord, that our character might be so molded, &gt;&gt; oh God, to your image is reflected perfectly. Oh father, may you just, oh God, take every one of us here this morning, Lord, in your hands. May you minister, Lord, very personally, Lord, to each and every need. You know, Lord, and Father, we just commit ourselves into your hands, Lord. We thank you and we love you in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you would um turn with me in Ecclesiastes chapter 3, [clears throat] uh I'm gonna read you a little quote before I get started here. Um just listened to this early early this morning and um always always I love brother Ram's balance and approach with these things. He says it's always good to come to the house of the Lord &gt;&gt; but much better it seems like in the Christmas and New Year's and holy days &gt;&gt; seems like it has a special little blessing left for us. It's just too bad we can't have this Christmas feeling all the time. people waving at you and saying the Lord bless you, that's good. That's one thing I like about Christmas. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, uh, if I don't get a chance to as the service comes, I want to wish every one of you a merry Christmas. Amen. May God bless you richly. Amen. During Amen. during during this time. And uh, so we want to just take here uh, a look here in the scripture. I want to say God bless you, brother Brian. You and Sister Gracie. Amen. And uh so we also want to remember I I don't think that it was wrote down um we had put it on the text thread about brother brother Danny Lewis. He's still in the Cleveland Clinic um with the pneumonia, the flu and uh his his sugar was really really bad the other day on top of everything. And that's why we sent that text out on Friday. And so we were just um texting back and forth here um this morning. So, just please let's remember him in prayer as well. And um also know sister Caroline, she's on her way to Costa Rica. And so, uh we just pray God just really just blesses her time and the flights going down there. I also want to say thank you. When I I came in there, um I appreciate the gifts. I did not even we did not uh uh tear into them. So, whoever is responsible for that, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Uh next Sunday, I'll I'll be looking for something different. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; There you go. There you go. &gt;&gt; You know, it's like brother Brandon when brother Brandham would talk about it, he said, "Oh," he says, "I would just like a kid looking around the Christmas tree on the morning." You know, and and so, you know, he was just uh he was so so just so precious. So, I want to say thank you. God bless you. Amen. And um but let's look here in the word in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse one and verse 5. To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven. A time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together. A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. So everything has its season and its time and its purpose and it's not contradictory. It's just finding the season that we're in &gt;&gt; and what what is to be applied within that season. And so when you you could read through the whole chapter, which no doubt as a Bible reader, you'd be familiar with, there's there's always that a time to cast away stones and times together them. Um when the time to cast them away is when it would come against your brother. The time to gather them is when you when you're facing the enemy. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; So there's there's the right time. There's a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. Let loose of things, forsake it, and embrace what's what's true. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; So with all of this, when this comes down, there's one thing that's a real key point is that it we require the discernment of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And so we certainly need God's God's discernment in our lives every day. And that's what the message of the hour has brought back to us, the discernment of the spirit. That brought it right back into the church to discern the word and discern that the word is true. Amen. So you may be seated. God bless his word. As you are being seated, I want to speak on this thought. Embracing deity. Embracing deity. When you take the word uh embrace, it means obviously to hold someone closely in one's arms. It's a sign as a sign of affection. It is also to accept or support um a belief or something willingly and enthusiastically. That's what it is to embrace. And we know we want to be uh found on the right side and embracing the right thing. We want to be found embracing deity, embracing the word of God in our bosom because that's what will change our life. And it it continues to change our lives. The more as God will reveal himself, the more then it leads us to empty out and the more that God steps in and that there's overcoming grace in our lives. And so I want to read just to lay a few scriptures as we're coming into this place here and looking here in the scriptures in John 14 where the Lord Jesus he really begins to lay in the focus of what is to come the purpose even in the ministry and and where the Holy Spirit is to is to uh come in after that of Calvary. I don't want just let me read just a few places in scripture. Philip said unto him,"Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us." And Jesus said unto him, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philillip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father, and how sayest thou then, show us the Father?" I want you to just take even just looking in that first few part there. What grace have I been with you so long a time and you've not known me? &gt;&gt; They they could recognize there's something different. Remember, brother Brandham said they would see and they would they would hear him speak and they would ponder and they would wonder and yet then they would look and say, "Well, this is this is different. No one has has spoke like this." and the miracles and all that was they were seeing taking place that it was it was something that they could not explain fully but yet how that the grace of God and I want to say that even to our own lives that sometimes a person or an individual can set around where the father is being revealed for some time. Your family can see the father being revealed for some time. That's so good &gt;&gt; because remember it's a portion of our heavenly father that comes to dwell inside of us to reflect his life. He is the vine. We're the branches. &gt;&gt; And so within this how how have I been with you so long and yet thou hast not known and recognized? Because we understand that there's many times when people will come and they'll ask you where do you go to church or what do you believe? And they're they're asking to try to fit you, categorize you and and what is it? And because there's something that's that's different and they realize there's something different about your life. It's even when when people would come here into the church, they they come into a service, they don't know they don't realize what exactly is, but there's something that's different than what they've experienced before. &gt;&gt; It's not music. It's not it's not people, but it's the Holy Ghost himself. And there's a there's a presence about it that even though that they may not fully understand at that time or at that moment, it might be months, it might be years, whatever the time is until finally that revelation drops like it did with Sarah. Sarah didn't catch what was going on at the time. But remember the prophet said in that quote, he says, uh, some of you are disagreeing with this right now. He said, but I can see further than you. And one of he says, "And I can see one of these days you're going to be believing it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the grace of God. So when we look at this, have I been so long a time with you, yet hast thou not known me? Uh Philillip, he that hath seen me hath seen the father. And how sayest thou then showest the father? Believest thou not that I am in the father, and the father in me? The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me. Or else believe me for the very work's sake. So the the works, as the prophet would say it like this, and taking that up, he put emphasis on his own works while on earth. and the works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him. So the the very the very manifestation of God's word because we realize that where the sick were healed my there was just you know there had been miracles throughout you know with there of the within the prophets and and different ones down through the time but never a man spake like this. Never had never had there been anything like this with this with this miraculous and ministry. But it's the promise that God made that he would raise up a prophet like unto Moses from among your brethren. And so we we see that the works itself was was that which was in complete uh unity and fulfillment with the word of God because when inspiring faith in him who is the word, it's inspiring the the the the faith in the promise that God has for you. Because when God begins to reveal himself, God is not, remember the prophet will take us through this all through the message that he said Jesus does not clown for anybody. &gt;&gt; He doesn't show off. He doesn't have to prove himself. The devil tried to get him into that. He he did not have to prove himself. He stayed with the father's word. And so within this that he was walking right in step with that word. And then that that fulfillment of that word is what would actually to inspire the faith of the believers in his life. I mean think about the men. Think about the disciples that were called from their ways of life. Friends, these would have these were not who's who of society. &gt;&gt; Are are you with me? These were not uh church members that had five stars on their apron. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? These were people that were the the offcower. These were indivi IN OTHER WORDS THESE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT we can go without spending all the time that that that no one would have even given them a chance. &gt;&gt; But you see they were in God's mind the whole time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when God he COMES DOWN THINK ABOUT WHAT LIFE Matthew is called from being a tax collector. Peter and and and his brethren called from being fishermen. They I mean they don't they didn't just do this for a living. They enjoyed what they did. &gt;&gt; They were good at it. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS something that that took A HOLD OF THEIR LIFE, ANDREW'S LIFE, BARTHOLOMEW'S LIFE. SOMETHING WAS BEING REAL TO THEM THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM GRACE TO FORSAKE THE THINGS THAT THEY ONCE HELD TO OR WHAT WOULD BRING THEM SATISFACTION. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS DOING THAT? IT WAS THE EFFECT OF THE WORD BEING REVEALED, THE PROMISE OF THE HOUR. AND THEY WERE A PART OF IT. THEY DIDN'T FULLY KNOW IT. THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. But it's JUST LIKE A MAGNET ATTRACTING something that is magnetized TO IT. IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT FORCE FIELD, BUT THERE IS A POWER THAT IS BEING EXERTED upon it. AND THAT'S THE SAME WAY THIS WORD HAS AND DOES HAVE UPON OUR LIFE. IT IS A POWER, A SUPERNATURAL POWER. IF I CAN SAY IT LIKE THIS, IT'S A DEFINED FREQUENCY OF THE WORD. WHAT FREQUENCY AM I TALKING ABOUT? THE SAME FREQUENCY THAT SAID, "LET there be IN THE BEGINNING." GOD HAS BROUGHT THE CHURCH BACK IN TUNE AND IN LINE WITH the original seed with his original word. &gt;&gt; John 14:1 15. If you love me, keep my commandments, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever. Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him. Now watch this. But you know him, &gt;&gt; FOR HE DWELLETH WITH YOU. and shall be in you. &gt;&gt; See, the transition must go from with &gt;&gt; to in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE REMEMBER, BROTHER RAM TELLS US JUST TO BE AROUND WHERE IT'S AT IS TO MAKE YOURSELF WORSE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; HE HE TELLS US WE'RE NOT JUST TO COME TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; to get into it. &gt;&gt; Right? So within YOU SAY, WELL, SETTING AROUND IT, HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF WORSE? IF IF A PERSON IS JUST SITTING AROUND AND THERE'S NO THERE'S NO ANCTIONIZING, THERE'S no uh STIRRING EVEN WITHIN THEIR HEART. AND listen friends, I I'm looking at the grace of God here, even in the word of God that I BELIEVE THAT GOD is the one who is mindful to stir our hearts that even when we would get lazy, even when things THAT THE ENEMY WOULD BOMBARD THE MIND, THE ENEMY WANTS TO SET TRAPS. HE WANTS TO TRY TO BRING DISTRACTIONS WHEN SATAN SEES THAT A PERSON IS GETTING READY TO BELIEVE. HOW MANY TIMES BROTHER RANDOM SAID RIGHT IN THE MEETING HOW SATAN WOULD WANT TO COME AND TRY TO AFFLICT. WHY? HE IS AFRAID WHEN A BELIEVER BEGINS TO BELIEVE. HE'S POWERLESS. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HE'S POWERLESS. THAT'S WHY HE PUTS SO MANY DIFFERENT DISTRACTIONS BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT WORD AND ACCEPT THAT WORD, THAT WORD HAS DYNAMIC POWER [screaming] WITHIN IT TO ACHIEVE AND BRING FORTH IN YOUR LIFE. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'M WITH YOU." BUT THAT'S NECESSARY. HE HAD TO BE WITH US. HE HAD TO BECOME ONE OF US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY TO ENTER INTO THE PROMISE OF GOD WITHOUT [screaming] FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE PROMISE HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY THAT A PERSON CANNOT SAY, "WELL, I RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST IN THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH." YOU MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED THE BAPTISM, BUT YOU NEVER RECEIVED THE WORD BIRTH. YOU HAVE GOT TO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE REVEALED WORD TO BE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH AND HE LEADS AND GUIDES you into all truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HE DWELLETH WITH you and shall be you. I'm so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; I'm grateful. LISTEN, GOD KNEW he didn't cut the messengers. He didn't cut brother Ram's time too short. It wasn't, oh, he he he needed to PREACH THIS. IT WAS ALL LAID OUT WHAT WE HAVE NEED OF. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE HAS, LET ME JUST SAY IT LIKE THIS, LIKE THE PROPHET SAID, "And on the wings of a SNOW WHITE DOVE, THE MESSAGE HAS GOT THROUGH. IT'S COME INTO THE CAMP." AND THE MESSAGE IS THE HOLY GHOST, THE DOVE, THE EVENING LIGHT, THE TOKEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST HIMSELF. IT HAS COME INTO THE CAMP. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SURE, there's a great battle on, but the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood, I the Lord will raise a standard against him. &gt;&gt; And that standard is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; It gives you confidence. God's listen, God's revealing is to give you confidence in the promise for your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch this. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. These things have I spoken unto you, being present with you. But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, notice, send in my name, in the revealed word, in the character, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you. John 16, he also goes in John 15 as well. How be it, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth. For he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will show you things TO COME. SO, HOW DO I KNOW THAT THAT IS THE TRUE SPIRIT OF GOD? CUZ IT WILL NEVER GLORIFY THE vessel it's working through. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THAT THE PROPHET SAID WITH SIGNS AND WONDERS THAT COME, I WANT TO HEAR THE VOICE THAT'S BEHIND IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHERE IS THAT VOICE TRYING TO TAKE ME TO? &gt;&gt; IF IT'S TAKING ME BACK TO SOMETHING IN THE PAST THAT IS NOT THE PROPHET SAID IT LIKE THIS, THAT DIDN'T COME FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; THE THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS GLORIFY THE WORK OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT IT DOES IN YOUR LIFE. IT GLORIFIES THE REDEEMING AND ATONING WORK BY IT BY GOD HIMSELF TAKING THE UPPERMOST SEA BY THE NEW BIRTH AND REFLECTING THROUGH YOUR LIFE THAT HE IS THE LORD OF ALL YOUR LIFE. HE'S THE LORD. HE'S OVERCOME IN EVERY AREA OF YOUR LIFE. HE'S THE LORD OF YOUR ATTITUDE, THE LORD OF YOUR EMOTION. HE'S THE LORD OF YOUR NATURE. HE IS THE LORD OF LORDS. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; LET ME GO BACK one one scripture here that verse 17. I WANT TO JUST capitalize here. Whom the world cannot receive. Now think ABOUT THIS IN THE SAME CHAPTER. Have I been so long with you, Philip? &gt;&gt; You haven't known me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you see, there was an awareness that there was something there WAS THERE WAS THAT PART THAT WAS ABOUT THEM THEY WERE GOING TO COME TO. BUT THEY HAD NOT COME TO THAT UNDERSTANDING AS OF YET. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; BUT LISTEN, GOD'S NOT REQUIRING UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INSPIRATION hasn't dropped for. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GRACE ACCOMPANIES THE WORD TO OPEN OUR EYES. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WALKING RIGHT WITH THE WORD. THEY FISHED WITH IT. THEY ATE WITH IT. THEY SLEPT AROUND THE WORD. THEY THEY THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WITH THE WORD. WHAT BETTER PLACE TO BE? LET ME TELL YOU, WHAT BETTER PLACE FOR OUR FAMILIES TO BE? WHAT BETTER PLACE FOR THAT TO BE IN YOUR LIFE AND IN YOUR HOME FOR THE WORD TO BE PRESENT AND LET THE WORD FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LIVES OF YOUR FAMILY? &gt;&gt; THEY NEED TO SEE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, I love that. I love that so much. So, let me have one final portion here of scripture. Jesus here in John 17 just one chapter after another neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word &gt;&gt; I'm one of them &gt;&gt; that's good &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; this intercessory prayer you say where did this intercessory prayer it reaches clear back to the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; hallelujah this IS WHAT THE WORD MADE FLESH is calling for &gt;&gt; is that right I love Now, I love how Brother Ram says it at the end of indictment. He says, "Lord," he says, "I I'm asking." He said that they said before the going away, there'll be such a revival that is poured out AMONG THE ELECT. HE SAID, "IT'S NOT HARD TO ASK THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED." &gt;&gt; And we understand that. WE'VE ALREADY WATCHED THE GEESE. WE'VE WATCHED THE BIRDS. THEY HAVE A REVIVAL BEFORE their migration. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS BROUGHT US. WE'VE NOT BEEN ASSEMBLED TO ANY MAN. WE'VE BEEN ASSEMBLED UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR, THE SON OF [screaming] MAN. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED UNDER CHRIST. MY &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT A PRIVILEGE. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ONE WHO TURNED THE WATER INTO WINE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ONE WHO TOOK A LITTLE LAD'S LUNCH AND HE FED A 5,000. WHAT ABOUT IN YOUR LIFE? WHAT ABOUT IN YOUR HOME? HE IS GOD, THE [screaming] CREATOR. HE KNOWS HOW TO TURN YOUR CHILDREN'S HEARTS. HE KNOWS HOW TO MELT DOWN THE WILL OF A SPOUSE. WE'RE [screaming] TALKING ABOUT LIVING UNDER THE PRESENCE OF THE SON OF MAN. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. &gt;&gt; We are his witnesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they may be one &gt;&gt; as thou, Father, art in me. and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, &gt;&gt; that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them, thou in me, that they may be made perfect and one, that the world may know that thou has sent me and hast loved them &gt;&gt; as thou has loved me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, when the Holy Spirit is come, it shows the same degree of love that was for the son. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Like, like, you know, I love you know, you love children, but you don't love children the same way you love your own. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That this is simple. That that's the same thing. God so loved the world, but God the degree for the elect, it surpasses. Amen. &gt;&gt; But but STILL I I REJOICE IN THAT GOD SO LOVED the world. &gt;&gt; I REGRET I'M SO GRATEFUL that the elective LOVE OF GOD BEING POURED OUT UPON THE ELECT OF GOD that was truly if you get TO LOOKING AT IT the elect. REMEMBER THE PROPHET STRESSED THIS HE SAID ESAU WAS A MUCH better man than Jacob. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's before the Holy Ghost came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said that's before the HOLY GHOST CAME. MORALLY SPEAKING, MY THE scales were tipped, man, in Esau's FAVOR. THAT GUY HAD SUCH HIGH MORALITY AND HE WAS SO, you know, UH JUST MAN, JUST RIGHT ON, MAN, WITH EVERYTHING. BUT WHEN THE HOLY GHOST CAME THAT was different, brother, &gt;&gt; that changed Jacob. &gt;&gt; IT BROUGHT A PRINCE OUT OF HIS LIFE. IT TOOK A SHYER AND A DECEIVER. IT TOOK A MAN THAT, YOU KNOW, THE WAY THAT HE WAS IN HIS LIFE. WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE? THE HOLY GHOST, THE PROMISE, THE BIRTHRIGHT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. IT WASN'T ENOUGH THAT HE HAD THE BIRTHIGHT. HE HAD TO BECOME ONE WITH THAT BIRTHRIGHT. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; HE WALKED WITH THE BIRTHRIGHT AND DECEIVED his father-in-law. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW? THIS IS WHY IT CAN'T JUST BE WITH OR AROUND WHERE THE MESSAGE IS AT. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU HAVE TO GET IN HIM &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU CAN WALK AROUND WHERE IT'S AT. AND THE SAME NATURE IS STILL THERE AND YOU'RE STILL GOING ABOUT DOING THE SAME THINGS STILL THE SAME WAY THAT YOU ALWAYS. OF COURSE MAY BE MORE RELIGIOUS, ABLE TO QUOTE SCRIPTURES, ABLE TO DO THIS AND ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT STILL THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IS STILL THERE BECAUSE EVEN LISTEN ONE OF THE WAYS THAT Satan tempts the people the prophet said in Satan's Eden is with intellectualism. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But this is the powerful thing. When God comes into our life, God takes control. &gt;&gt; It ain't about our smarts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You may not even be able to pronounce certain words. &gt;&gt; You may not know the definition to a certain word. &gt;&gt; That don't make you any more of a believer, any less of a believer. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The Bible says study to study to debate. No, it says study to show thyself approved. It means a relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where you're taking the word in and feeding on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not studying it just to pivot. &gt;&gt; That's not a relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So embracing deity. Embracing deity. When when Jesus spoke this in John 17, the disciples had WALKED WITH HIM, yet they were still not one with him. Right? &gt;&gt; And the only way they could become one with him would be through his life coming into them through the sacrificial offering of his own life. Now I want you to think in Luke 24 you find even prior to Luke 24 I mean you know Peter said LORD I WILL DIE for you. &gt;&gt; I'm embracing this. I WILL DIE FOR YOU. Jesus said before the &gt;&gt; crows three times. &gt;&gt; You'll deny me. I want you to listen very carefully. Peter took his own feelings of his own heart above what the word was saying about his heart. &gt;&gt; Can I repeat that? &gt;&gt; Peter took his own feelings about his own heart above what the word was discerning in his heart. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, search me. &gt;&gt; Search me. &gt;&gt; Search me, Lord. And here they we understand the scripture smite the shepherds scattered the sheep. BUT NOTICE THEY THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR FISHING. THEY WENT BACK TO everything they had been doing. I mean they WERE DISHEARTENED. BROTHER JOY. IT WAS LIKE THEIR IT WAS LIKE THEIR LIFE WAS RIPPED OUT. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET CALLED IT BEWILDERED. &gt;&gt; WE JUST KIND OF WALKING AROUND in a days. &gt;&gt; We've all been there with different things that didn't happen OR DIDN'T GO HOW WE THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS EVEN WHERE uh of different calculations and predictions and this and that. IT HASN'T HAPPENED THE WAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT FIGURED OUT BECAUSE GOD'S NOT INTERESTED THAT WE HAVE THINGS figured out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO TRUST HIM AND WALK BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; MOSES COULD NOT REMEMBER WHAT THE PROPHET SAY. IF MOSES WOULD HAVE EVEN TOOK one of those leaves and tried to analyze it, his even his motive in doing that would have shut down the supernatural &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WASN'T ABOUT ANALYZING. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT HAD BEEN HIS PROBLEM ALL ALONG. THAT'S WHY HE ONLY DEFEATED ONE STINKING EGYPTIAN BECAUSE IT WAS AN ANTILITICAL WAY TO HIM. HE KNEW THE PROMISE, BUT NOW HE NEEDED TO MEET THE PROMISE HIMSELF. [screaming] THE GOD WHO MADE THAT PROMISE AND WHEN HE GOT WITH THAT GOD THEN GOD GOT IN HIM. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID WHEN JUST THAT MOMENT THERE GOD ALREADY HAD THE EQUIPMENT IN MOSES he only needed that moment to light it off. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in Luke 24 here the great arms of the Lord Jesus of deity himself reaches out and begins to draw them back in through the fulfillment of the promised word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They're drawn from their bewilderment, drawn from their disappointment. We thought, we thought, I thought, we thought. They're drawn from that. And the word is there just to set them in motion. And they embrace that promise of the fulfillment of the message. I love it. Even with Peter said, "Go tell Peter. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; He's going to need his name personally mentioned because he's going to be feeling lower." &gt;&gt; The others walked away. But but you know, Peter, you know, &gt;&gt; SO HE SAID, "GO TELL PETER AS WELL." YOU SEE, WHAT WAS THE WORD DOING? IT WAS GATHERING. IT WASN'T LOOKING AND SAY, "OH, PETER, HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS, PETER?" IT KNEW. THE WORD KNEW. IT ISN'T ABOUT, "OH, HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS AND DONE THAT?" WE'RE NOT HERE TO TRY TO REFORM SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; IT'S TO GET HIM IN CONTACT WITH JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE WHO STABILIZES YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THEY EMBRACE THE FULFILLMENT. THEY WALKED WITH HIM IN LUKE 24 and here they are. He makes as though he's going to go on by and they say, "Hey, hey, hey, hey." They constrained him. &gt;&gt; Come in. &gt;&gt; And when he got in there, he be to do things &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; in that little secret place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He It wasn't a public show. He began to reveal himself there in that little place and and begin to undo what he had always done. &gt;&gt; And it brought their attention to this is him. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram will say it like this. HE SAID THEY HAD a little idea all along that it was him. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Sam. No, no, no, no. They they had a LITTLE IDEA. BUT SEE, GOD JUST DON'T WANT YOU WALKING with a little idea. Maybe. I don't know. POSSIBLY. GOD DOESN'T WANT YOU PRESUMING BECAUSE YOU YOU YOU CAN NEVER OBTAIN ANY PROMISE AS LONG AS YOU'RE WONDERING. IF THE DEVIL HAS YOU WONDERING, WELL, I WONDER IF THIS IS FOR YOU. THIS MAY NOT BE FOR YOU. AND IF YOU ENTERTAIN THAT, THE ONLY THING THAT WILL DO IS PARALYZE THE FAITH THAT GOD HAS ALREADY BEEN INSTILLING IN YOUR HEART. WHAT DO I DO? CAST OUT EVERY SPIRIT, EVERY WORD, EVERY THOUGHT THAT SPEAKS CONTRARY TO THE WORD AND BELIEVE THE WORD ABOVE YOUR OWN THOUGHTS, ABOVE WHAT YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT YOURSELF. BELIEVE WHAT THE WORD IS SAYING ABOUT YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So the word itself assures us of THE PROMISE. THE WORD ASSURES US of the promise because it is THE PROMISE. SO THE word walking with us IN OUR MIDST IS THE PROMISE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH. THAT'S WHY I SAID THAT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN AND AND HERE THEY ARE. THEY SIT HERE AND YOU YOU KNOW THEY THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFERENT. AND I'LL JUST SAY IT LIKE THIS. JUST AS GOD WAS PATIENT WITH US, WE HAVE TO LET GOD WORK EVERYTHING OUT. IT CAN BE LIKE THIS, FRIENDS. IT CAN BE A PERSON THAT SAT FOR 40 YEARS IN A MESSAGE CHURCH AND THEY'VE BEEN WITH THE WORD, BUT NEVER IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT NOT STUDYING THE WORD. I'M TALKING ABOUT THEY'VE NEVER COME INTO the place of a real relationship with God. &gt;&gt; We don't want TO JUST BE WITH, we want to be in because that's rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word assures us of the promise because it is the promise. The word is the promise and the word is God and the word is ours. And we become the word and the word becomes us. IF YOU ABIDE in me and my word abide in you. See it just becomes one great big family. It assures us because why? It's a part of us. It becomes a part of us. What a text. It assures us of the promise. &gt;&gt; Now I want to say the prophet would continue to place this and going in the seals. Brother Brandon would very very very clearly and begin to say in the opening of going into those seals, God-hiding and simplicity, he'll use these two words together, revelation and vindication. &gt;&gt; He said it must be vindicated. NOT ONLY REVEALED, BUT IT MUST BE VINDICATED BECAUSE GOD WILL NOT VINDICATE anything other than his word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And what he vindicates is what he's revealed. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THAT WORD IS REVEALED AND IT NOW COMES INTO A PLACE OF PREEMINENCE IN THE HEART AND LIFE OF THE BELIEVER, THEN THAT WORD IS VINDICATED. &gt;&gt; And God, LISTEN NOW, WITH THAT WORD BEING VINDICATED, GOD also is vindicating a people. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE A PART OF HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. My my my. The fourth seal, the prophet said it like this. He said, "Oh, this is how it was on the day of Pentecost." He said the spirit poured out upon them and when the vindication of the revelation took place then stimulation was upon them. Oh, he said it steamed them up right good too. Right in the streets they went. They weren't afraid. They they were afraid before they had the door shut. They were out in the streets where they had been afraid of a group of people preaching the gospel to them. But something had happened because the true word of promise was vindicated. HE SAID, 'NOW WATCH IF THAT BROUGHT SUCH POSITIVE TO THEM MEN. You see what the Holy Spirit does? It brings the positive promise inside of your heart &gt;&gt; to where that you walk with a positivity. &gt;&gt; YOU WALK WITH AN ASSURANCE. YOU WALK WITH A CONFIDENCE IN THAT I KNOW WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; I KNOW IN WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED. I KNOW MY ELECTION COMES FROM GOD. AND I KNOW WHAT I WAS AND I KNOW THAT HE'S CHANGED MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT MY LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST MY THINKING. MY [screaming] LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED. MY DESIRES HAVE BEEN CHANGED. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; I didn't GO FROM READING NOVELS TO READING THE BIBLE. THAT'S VERY ALL THAT'S ALL AND GOOD. BUT BUT ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS IS THAT AND I BELIEVE THE HOLY SPIRIT, IT'LL GIVE US A HUNGER FOR THE WORD, BUT [screaming] OUR LIVES, OUR NATURE HAS BEEN CHANGED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY. And you know what? You can't explain that. &gt;&gt; It's something that God reveals to you personally. &gt;&gt; And it brings a positive to your life. &gt;&gt; It just settles you. It settles you with with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. And you know the word it's a relationship. It's a love affair. &gt;&gt; You long to hear the word. It's you're ready, you know, for when the word comes. If the word, you know, brings correction, my ready to to come right in and to come under that word. Why? You're recognizing the word as your mate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Now watch." HE SAID, "IF that brought such a positive to them to every nearly every one of them sealed their testimony with their own blood, no matter what come along, as long as they lived, they never got over it. It stayed there because it was the true word of promise vindicated and the revelation become of vindicated. &gt;&gt; He said look at the promise of these LAST DAYS RIGHT BEFORE US THAT'S VINDICATED THE PRESENT coming of the Holy Spirit and the works that he's supposed TO DO AND WE FIND IT right among us. You see, just stopping right here. When you want to know why that a person could take and say this is brother Bram's opinion, this is brother Bram's thought, they've missed this. &gt;&gt; This is not DL Moody. &gt;&gt; This is not this is not this is not man's thoughts. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; This is this AND THIS IS WHAT WHEN THAT REVELATION COMES, IT BRINGS YOU REST. YOU BECOME A feeder &gt;&gt; on the word. &gt;&gt; You feed on the word. &gt;&gt; There's a difference in just, you know, just just listen to it and feeding it. And when you feed it, it it's ministering to you. YOU YOU YOU OPEN THE WORD. YOU OPEN THE BIBLE. THE WORD'S BEING PREACHED, MAN. THERE'S IT'S A CHANNEL AS THE PROPHET SAID IT LIKE THIS. HE SAID THE GIFT HERE AND THE GIFT IN YOUR LIFE. HE SAID IT OPENS UP A CHANNEL AND THAT BECOMES THE SECRET FOOD MOVING THROUGH THAT CHANNEL. YES. &gt;&gt; SEE, YOU'RE IN TUNE WITH GOD IN EVEN WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH. YOU'RE IN TUNE WITH GOD COMING INTO FELLOWSHIP HERE IN THE CHURCH. IT KEEPS US LINED UP. IT KEEPS US IN FELLOWSHIP. IT KEEPS US IN TUNE WITH GOD'S VOICE. THAT'S GOD'S GRACE TO YOU AND I. SO THAT WHY IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL WALK WITH GOD, YOU ARE walking &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's walking in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God watching over his word. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, he said, "And when that it right among us." So to vindicate something, I love this definition. It means to clear someone of blame or suspicion. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Show or prove to be right, reasonable or justified. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS COME, SEE, LISTEN. THE MESSAGE MUST BE REVEALED. THIS IS TRUTH. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But now once it's revealed that this is truth, it now becomes the responsibility. Let that word be vindicated. &gt;&gt; Let it be proven to where you become a part &gt;&gt; of that word. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So listen, that's important. You can't we can't go any further. The disciples couldn't have went to Acts 2 without Luke 24. Luke 24 was the revealing of the resurrected LORD JESUS CHRIST, THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISE. WHAT DID THAT DO? BUILD FAITH &gt;&gt; FOR THEIR PART. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE REVEALING OF THE WORD DOES. THAT'S WHAT THE REVELATION DOES. IT CALLS UPON YOU AND I FOR US TO surrender our lives &gt;&gt; that we might embrace deity. &gt;&gt; Glory. So this is why brother Random, you know, when he speaks out of a super sign, I just been just enjoying those messages over the the past little bit here, some weeks. But brother Ram would would say it like this. He said, notice, he said, he said, "This is my beloved son. Hear you him in whom I'm well pleased." HE SAID, NOTICE HE SENT FORTH HIS apostles and they burnt up the earth in their days as God being one WITH MAN. THEY BAPTIZED THE people in the name of that God Jesus Christ. And they live so CLOSE TO HIM TILL HE MANIFESTED HIMSELF THROUGH THEM through signs and WONDERS AND GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, GOD WITH US. THEY PREACHED THERE WAS ONE TRUE LIVING GOD. NOW REMEMBER, IT'S IN THIS HOUR IN THE EVENING TIME WHERE GOD RESTORED THE REVELATION OF THE GODHEAD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHERE GOD RESTORES THAT BACK TO WHERE GOD AND MAN ARE ONE. TO WHERE THE JESUS WAS NOT A SECOND PERSON. AS BROTHER BRANDON WILL SAY IT IN SUPER SIGN. HE SAID SOME WANT TO MAKE HIM A SHORT GOD. HE SAID HE WASN'T A SHORT GOD. HE WAS GOD. [applause and cheering] YOU KNOW WHO DOES THAT? THE DEVIL DOES THAT. THAT'S THE DOCTRINE OF [screaming] DEVILS TO TAKE AWAY THE REAL EXPERIENCE OF THE DEITY OF JESUS CHRIST. THE REAL BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT'LL CHANGE A MAN AND PUT A NEW MAN INSIDE OF THAT OLD GARMENT. IT BRINGS THE LIVING GOD, EMMANUEL, GOD, WITH US. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; SATAN HATES THIS REVELATION. There's more I could say upon that, but I won't here this morning. Ram talks about, he'll say, I love how he uses these phrases, the evening light people. The evening light people, he said, take heed. The message is revived again. This same message in the last days. He said, what message? God and man are one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "And who it appeals to is the evening light people." &gt;&gt; Does it appeal to you? &gt;&gt; The evening light people. &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory be to God. So this is where when we walking where the word is at. Brother Brandon will use this in multiple places in the message about that of a young man looking and seeing real potential, seeing real true attributes inside of a young lady. And he says, "Here's a woman standing here. I'm a young man waiting to get married. She meets my specifications in every way. She's a lovely Christian. She looks like one. She dresses like one. She acts like one. She lives like one. I'll admit she'd make me a good wife, but she isn't mine till I take her from mine. That's the way the message is. You can sympathize with it and say it's right. But you've got to take it yourself to become part of it. &gt;&gt; Then you and the message become one. &gt;&gt; Then the anointings with you as it is with others. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends how this is this is what's important is because as the prophet would say it like this in what house will you build me at 65. He makes this he makes this statement within just a just a brief message. And he says the message that God has given us in this hour is not only to be the flame of the hour. It's to be the flame that burns in our hearts. &gt;&gt; And he said if it doesn't burn in our hearts, we can't rightly present it &gt;&gt; because it's not our oration, our great oratory skills, our ability to pronounce words. That's not what does it. &gt;&gt; Jesus said flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; The flesh and blood that was standing there did not reveal it. &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD BEHIND THE VEIL, BUT IT WAS GOD REVEALING HIMSELF THROUGH THAT VEIL TO BE GOD. &gt;&gt; PETER CAUGHT THAT REVELATION. &gt;&gt; He couldn't GET AWAY FROM THAT REVELATION. BUT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, THAT REVELATION BECAME A VINDICATION. WHAT DID THAT REVELATION DO? IT BROUGHT SINCERITY. WHAT DOES REVELATION DO? IT CAUSES YOU TO RELEASE, LIKE THE PROPHET SAID, many great pearl truths. But he says, when you FIND THE PEARL OF GREAT PRICE, YOU'RE WILLING TO LET go of all the other PEARLS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU FOUND THE PEARL of great price. YOU SEE GOD, LISTEN, GOD WILL NOT TAKE SOMETHING FROM YOU AND GIVE YOU SOMETHING LESS. WHAT GOD DOES IS HE REMOVES FROM OUR LIVES WHAT IS NOT HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE WHAT DOES HE DO IN EXCHANGE? HE TAKES OUR GUILT. HE TAKES OUR SHAME. HE TAKES EVERYTHING THAT THERE IS ABOUT US AND IS SURRENDERED AND HE POURS himself in. &gt;&gt; You know what's beautiful? He continues to pour himself in. All right. &gt;&gt; Cuz the song, the more that I surrender, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The more that I surrender &gt;&gt; this relationship. Hallelujah. So, just to sympathize with it, just to say it's right. It's the truth. That's that's a that's a very important thing. But it's got to become one with this word. That's the only way it can happen is by the holy the Holy Spirit. And so notice these this is why brother Bram used the term she isn't mine until I take the responsibility of her being my wife because be the responsibility is going to be forsaking other things &gt;&gt; and your priority. You don't just you don't just hem and you don't just go and you don't just when you're single you do what you want to do right even when you're courting even engagement you still have your times but you go back to your own house &gt;&gt; and you have your own me time I'm just saying friends &gt;&gt; but there becomes a responsibility &gt;&gt; now let me just tell you if if the word if it's looking at oh it's burdensome oh it's a well you you've got what it is. FIRST OF ALL, YOU'VE GOT TO SEE him for who he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU'VE IT'S GOT TO BE REVEALED WHO HE IS AND what he wants to do for you. &gt;&gt; See, Jesus don't want to be a boyfriend. &gt;&gt; He won't be a boyfriend. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE PROPHET SAID IN CHRIST the mystery, HE SAID HE'S NOT REVEALING this secret to flurers. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE SINCERITY. IT'S GOT TO BE SAYING LIKE THIS. GOD, LET MY HEART BE LINED UP. LET IT BE SINCERE AS I NEED TO BE IN THIS HOUR. THIS IS A SERIOUS HOUR. &gt;&gt; YES, IT IS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GIVEN UNLIMITED CHANCES. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME, FRIENDS? &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET PUTS IT VERY CLEARLY. WE'RE NOT GIVEN UNLIMITED CHANCES. WE TAKE THE SEAL OR WE TAKE THE MARK. &gt;&gt; And the prophet brings that right in with these statements within your about just sympathizing. So many don't want to, you know, others will COME IN CONTACT. THEY DON'T WANT TO ROT AWAY. THEY DON'T WANT TO DIE AWAY. They don't want to they don't want to get away from things. They don't want WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT. LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. EVEN GOING SO FAR WITH THE WORD AND THE WORD BEGINS TO TOUCH PET DOCTRINES THAT ARE not the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; God can allow that to go. And here he is. He's trying to deal with that, trying to address that because it's got to be that of a fullness of the word. Now, are there things THAT YOU AND I have believed, have thought, and we thought wrong? I know there's probably some angels in here that everything you've ever thought was wrong. Donuts with angels and I get it. &gt;&gt; But you ain't fooling with me [panting] cuz brother Bram didn't even live like that like that. &gt;&gt; But but what what what came what was it that came and touched your heart? The spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; AND SEE SHOWING WATCH NOW SHOWING THAT THAT LIFE IS ALREADY THERE. YOU YOU FOLLOW THAT TRUTH OF THE WORD. YOU LET [screaming] GO OF THAT BECAUSE YOU REALIZE WHAT IT IS YOU'RE HOLDING ON TO, THE UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE LEANING ON, RESTING ON, WHAT YOU'RE RESTING UPON, AND YOU REALIZE THIS IS A HINDRANCE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT MY POSITIVE. IT'S NOT MY CONFIDENCE. IT'S A HINDRANCE. &gt;&gt; IT'S SOMETHING I'VE RESTED ON. OH, I get this feeling. Oh, I GET THIS. IT'S SOMETHING I'VE RESTED ON. I'M NOT GOING TO LEAN TO MY OWN UNDERSTANDING. I'M GOING TO LEAN AND REST IN THE WORD OF MY HUSBAND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why you cannot even rest and lean upon your feelings. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you went by your feelings, many of us would not even been here today. &gt;&gt; Probably I wouldn't have been standing right here and have a whole lot of rest and things. But you know, we got to go beyond OUR FEELINGS. WHAT DRIVES YOU TO GO BEYOND YOUR FEELINGS? The love of God. &gt;&gt; The love of God. The prophet SAID, "THE LOVE OF GOD TAKES FAITH AND DRAGS IT OUT to the battlefront. So to becoming one, Moses became one. It was going to cost Moses. &gt;&gt; But he kept on looking through that window. And finally one day, Moses, he kept on seeing what he was seeing. And he made a choice. I'm not going to sympathize no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you might say, well, he fell flat on his face, but at least he was making steps forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he went from falling flat on his face with a dead Egyptian to getting on his face before THE BURNING BUSH. GOD WAS GETTING HIM right where he NEEDED TO BE. SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT THINGS AND FRIENDS, WE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS COULD GO SO LONG. AND LISTEN, IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME THAT A PERSON, OH, they would go 30 YEARS OR WHAT. THAT DON'T BOTHER ME. WE'RE NOT HERE RATING ANYBODY. THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE IS UNTIL THAT LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED AND MADE READY FOR RAPTURE AND CHRIST BECOMES PREEMINENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Because that battle of preeminence, it's every day in your life once you have been born again of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; It's constantly laying down our will. This is where the scripture said, you know, within our lives, it talks about these that went on in Hebrews 11. They all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them far off. They they it was revealed to them and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed them that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. &gt;&gt; Their lives had been affected by the word that had BEEN REVEALED. &gt;&gt; IT CHANGED the course of their life. &gt;&gt; It took Abraham FROM BEING A GOD MAKER &gt;&gt; to becoming a God himself, &gt;&gt; son of God. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. From making lifeless, DUMB IMAGES THAT HE HAD TO PACK AROUND. That's right. &gt;&gt; AND GOD TOOK ABRAHAM AND GOD. DID GOD DO? GOD MADE A LIVING image out of Abraham. Brother Brandham says it like this. You are God's idol. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS SHAPED YOU AND FASHIONED YOU BY HIS WORD. AND YOU DON'T HAVE EARS THAT YOU CAN'T HEAR. YOU'VE GOT EARS YOU CAN HEAR. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE A MOUTH THAT YOU CAN'T SPEAK. YOU'RE NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT'S AN OUTLINE OR A FIGURE OR JUST, YOU KNOW, JUST AN OUTLINE OF A MESSAGE. YOU ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THIS MESSAGE. THE BREATH OF GOD [screaming] HAS BREATHED UPON YOUR LIFE AND CHANGED YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T A CHURCH PACKING YOU AROUND. &gt;&gt; COME ON, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN, WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PACK ME HERE AND PACK ME THERE AND PACK ME THERE. IT'S GOT TO COME TO A PLACE IN TIME TO WHERE YOU LET GOD [screaming] HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE AND LET GOD PACK YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET THE WORD PACK YOU THROUGH CUZ THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'LL EVER TAKE YOU THROUGH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PROMISE OF THE COMFORTER. &gt;&gt; This is why faith is a long range vision. &gt;&gt; Faith when the Bible would tell us that we don't look at things which are seen because they're temporal. &gt;&gt; They're temporal. But the things which are not seen with these eyes are eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith is the substance &gt;&gt; of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. It affects you. &gt;&gt; You know what faith is? It's a revelation of the will of God. &gt;&gt; You know what caused Abraham to go to the hospital and make payments? Faith. &gt;&gt; It wasn't hope. It was faith. &gt;&gt; Faith gave him hope and expectation. &gt;&gt; He didn't know how it was going to be. He didn't even know when it was going to be. He just said, "I'm here to make another payment." &gt;&gt; Right? You might have think, you might have thought that you got a room where things are stored up. They had the diapers stored up. &gt;&gt; You know why? They were preparing. &gt;&gt; Abraham had they had embraced that promise. Even though Sarah hadn't come to it yet, they embraced that promise. IT WAS BY FAITH. AND WHEN YOU HAVE FAITH, your works will declare your faith. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Right? &gt;&gt; It will declare cuz what everybody was saying, you know, when Abraham walking around, we're going to have a baby. We're going to have a baby. The prophet said that was invisible to everybody else except Abraham. &gt;&gt; He said, but one day what was invisible to Abraham became visible to everybody else he had been testifying to. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE POWER OF CONFESSION. THAT'S HOW THEY WALKED. THEY THEY SEEN IT. THEY WERE PERSUADED OF IT. THEY EMBRACED IT. AND THEY CONFESSED IT. AND WHAT THEY HAD SAW AND THEIR LIFE BECAME WRAPPED IN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It became visible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "When did it become visible?" At the door of paradise. THAT'S HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HIM. &gt;&gt; AND THEY UP THEY CAME ON THAT RESURRECTION MORNING WITH HIM, THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR, AND ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; THEY ASCENDED INTO THAT CITY. THEY WERE PART OF THAT. OPEN UP THE GATES. HE EVERLASTING GATES. OPEN [screaming] UP. WHO IS THIS? THE LORD OF GLORY, &gt;&gt; MIGHTY [screaming] IN BATTLE. THE ONE WHO HAD DEFEATED SATAN, BROKE THE BACKBONE OF THE DEVIL, THE ONE THAT HAD CONQUERED SIN. THE ONE THAT HAD CONQUERED SATAN'S TRINITY. HE HAS AROSE. HE IS ALIVE. HE HAS OPENED UP THE WAY [screaming] BACK TO FULL FELLOWSHIP WHERE GOD AND MAN ARE RESTORED ONCE AGAIN. EMMANUEL, GOD WITH US. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; This is why the focus in our lives, whatever you focus on will affect you &gt;&gt; and it'll affect the others in your family. &gt;&gt; If you want to know if you've got the right focus, look at your family. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You got to be dial dialed in because your focus will will invite God's presence into the home to effect. Now listen, you never, you don't, it's not you nor me that changes our children, &gt;&gt; but it's the presence of God. &gt;&gt; It's inviting him in. &gt;&gt; IT'S BRINGING GOD in skin right next TO HIM. &gt;&gt; IT'S LETTING THEM SEE WHAT EMMANUEL is like. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? KEEPING THEM UNDER THE PRESENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. THEY THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT PUTTING TOGETHER BECAUSE EVEN IF AS A CHILD THEY CAN REPEAT doctrines if you say it long enough 2 plus 2 equals 4 2 plus 2 equals 4 and I get it GOD CAN GIVE EVEN UNDERSTANDING BUT LISTEN FRIENDS THERE'S times as I told you before there's quotes I you could start I could finish &gt;&gt; sitting on a bar stool it's not about that &gt;&gt; you've got to meet the God of this message &gt;&gt; you've got to meet because the God of this message is the message it is Christ &gt;&gt; amen and have a personal experience with him. &gt;&gt; Oh my, when I can read those quotes and read that now, it's entirely different in MY LIFE BECAUSE WHY? MY LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED. &gt;&gt; I WASN'T QUOTING THEM AS THOUGH TO PROP MYSELF UP. IT'S JUST I HAD HEARD THEM. THE TAPES WERE PLAYED IN MY HOUSE. I HAD HEARD IT PREACHED. THERE'S QUOTES I HAD THINGS I HAD HEARD PREACHED. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; But one day, &gt;&gt; one day, &gt;&gt; what I knew to be truth became vindicated. &gt;&gt; See, this is why with the focus of our lives, I know it isn't this isn't real popular, but this is where where the crosshairs get put on the devil that wants to try to take from people from God, from the people of God, the application of the word. Right? &gt;&gt; Satan's business is to try to distract from what God is revealing. Do you realize the prophet said it like this in Christ the mystery? He said what God has revealing, what he's trying to reveal. Now watch this. What he's trying to reveal, what he's trying to get to you, he said you let your job take it out of you. &gt;&gt; You let &gt;&gt; he said your pastor take it out of you. He's talking about the ministries after people in the meetings they go say you let you let your boss you let your co-workers you let this you let that it like it leeches out. See this is why what's been revealed you you you have to protect that. &gt;&gt; How do you protect that? By embracing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By how do I embrace it? That's why the prophet says it like this in the Pergeamian church age. Don't let anything get between you and that word. &gt;&gt; Nothing gets between you and that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; OH, I WANT MY FAMILY SAVED. THEY'LL never see Christ if you let them get between you and Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you WANT TO SEE HIM SAVED, THEN YOU HAVE TO SAY, "GOD, it's me and you." And Lord God, let my life be so reflected to where it's Christ the influence. IT'S WHERE IT'S EMMANUEL reflecting his life. &gt;&gt; Right? This is our prayer. &gt;&gt; God, let it be with him that way. Let it be. Let it be God with us. SO HERE THAT FOCUS AND WE BY THE SPIRIT OF God as Paul said there in Colossians set our affections &gt;&gt; on things above. If you're raised he said if you're raised set your affections on things above &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; see we the enemy wants to try to take things from us BUT THIS IS WHERE WITHIN it you listen you GOT TO UNDERSTAND THE DEVIL'S TACTIC. HE'S TRYING TO TAKE FROM YOU WHAT GOD IS WANTING TO PUT IN YOU and then let that word WORK IN YOUR LIFE. LISTEN, ONCE IT'S REVEALED, THEN [screaming] WHAT FOLLOWS IT? VINDICATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And vindication is where the Holy Spirit comes down and ignites that word. It brings out a positive life. &gt;&gt; It brings out a life of stability. It brings out a life that's free from sin. It brings out a life that can look right in the face of sin and everything else can walk right by everything and can take the word of God fully. And there's not one thing in the word where your soul won't punctuate it with an amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So it be it begs us and behooves us for these questions to pass FOR US TO PASS THINGS THROUGH IN OUR MIND BECAUSE PAUL SAID, "STAND FAST IN THE LIBERTY THAT YOU'VE BEEN MADE FREE IN CHRIST. DON'T BE ENTANGLED." HE'S LETTING US KNOW YOU COULD BECOME ENTANGLED AGAIN, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT TO STAND FAST. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT A WAR. YOU'VE GOT TO BATTLE. [screaming] YOU'VE GOT TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN POSITIONED IN CHRIST, YOU DO NOT BECOME ON A PICNIC. YOU'VE ENTERED A BATTLEGROUND. &gt;&gt; AND THAT BATTLEGROUND IS WHERE YOU SUBMITTING OF OUR LIVES AND OUR CHARACTER BEING MOLDED. CHARACTER IS NOT A GIFT. &gt;&gt; It's a victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an overcoming process that first even begins with overcoming when it's revealed to you even the error or what in our life. And when I say error, I'm talking about maybe it's an action. Maybe it's something in your life that you realize the Holy Spirit brings it up at that time and how that you interact or HOW THIS AT THAT MOMENT WHEN HE'S REVEALED IT. IT DOESN'T MEAN AT THAT TIME THAT OH, IT'S GONE AWAY. WHAT IT MEANS IS WHEN HE'S REVEALED THAT PORTION IN YOUR LIFE, THAT'S THE TIME TO EMBRACE DEITY AND SAY, "OH GOD, LORD, TEACH ME, SHOW ME, GIVE ME DISCERNMENT. THERE'S A WEAKNESS IN MY LIFE, LORD. YOU KNOW THOSE WEAKNESSES, BUT THERE'S NO WEAKNESSES IN THE GENE SEED OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WEAKNESSES IN YOUR WORD, LORD. &gt;&gt; I EMPTY MYSELF OUT, LORD, &gt;&gt; THAT you might feel. That's embracing deity. &gt;&gt; It's embracing it. Taking it to your bosom. &gt;&gt; And so you have the questions that there are lives things must pass through. How will this draw me closer to the Lord Jesus? How will this affect my home? Will this hinder my walk? Our whole life. Brother Brandon would make statements and I I just love I I'm going to read one of them to you, but there's multiple that over the weeks as I'm just studying and meditating on these two words with and in. And brother Brown would say, "Lord, our whole life is wrapped in this token. &gt;&gt; Our whole life is wrapped in it. It's everything. &gt;&gt; He's become my everything." &gt;&gt; He's my all and all. &gt;&gt; And you know what? that becomes more real to us. &gt;&gt; The Rem says, "May our hearts be continually set on thee." We know, Lord, that money, property, things of the world have no meanings. They're just so temporal. All of them must go. Our jobs, our places, our friends, everything must go. No matter how rich, how poor, how popular, or unpopular we are, we are, it all must go. But there is only one thing that our being here is centered around and that's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God let us lay aside everything as secondarily and hold to him. &gt;&gt; I don't care how solid your company is. And I know God provides for his children. &gt;&gt; I don't care how solid your company is. I don't care how solid your skills are. I think all those things are wonderful. I mean, look, it's it's wonderful where you can have a peace of mind to go into a weekend and you don't have things being talked about, right? &gt;&gt; Like when I was teaching school and sometimes they'll talk about, oh, we're looking at maybe a strike or what more. I thought, dear God, I'm just is my first year of teaching. The people working at the counter of McDonald's are making more than me. &gt;&gt; I I need every single dollar. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And any other dollar anybody will give me strike? I can't strike. &gt;&gt; Right. Those kind of things can it can it can get in your mind. &gt;&gt; And you know what that's where we have to follow the word and bringing in subjection. &gt;&gt; You know what God does there in some of those early times. I look back in my life some of those early times and early battles. There were only preparation. And you know what it does? It doesn't take away that the battle's still not real. It just builds your patience &gt;&gt; and your expectation. He did it before. He'll do it again. &gt;&gt; Lion, bear, Goliath, he's the same God. SEE, IT JUST IT'S BUILDING FAITH AND patience in God. &gt;&gt; Everything else the prophet goes on to say in spiritual food and due season, he said, "It's like Elisha of old. If God be God, then serve him." &gt;&gt; And if Jesus is the center of all things to the Christian, then I think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to him. &gt;&gt; He's the center. He's the northstar. He's the ultimate. He's the absolute. He's the north star. And it will always, that one thing that's pointed to that north star is your compass. And that compass, he says, that I'm trying to sail with is this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just let me close here. &gt;&gt; I have a lot more hay on my fork, but we're getting there. It's one nice thing about being a pastor. You can just continue. Here's the promise of Isaiah and it's being declared. The people which sat in darkness saw great light. And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. We were not just in darkness. We were darkness. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; We didn't find him. He came to us. &gt;&gt; We didn't find the message. The message found us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was God. GOD COMING. THE LIGHT IN THE LIGHT BEING THE FULFILLMENT OF HIS WORD AND IT BEGINS TO TAKE A HOLD OF OUR LIFE. AND THINK ABOUT IT, FRIENDS, JUST LIKE EVEN MANY THAT WERE EVEN SITTING THERE THAT CONTINUED ON IN THE TABERNACLE, EVEN AS REAL BELIEVERS, THEY SAT THERE, THEY KNEW SOMETHING WAS REAL, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But they didn't THEY DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON. I I shared with you many times IF YOU JUST IF YOU haven't you read through Osborne in the memorial service. I have been going through that here over the past few months of different things when you read things that TL Osborne said and yet what you realize IS THE SO THE THINGS THAT TL OSBORNE said within there in brother Brandon's memorial service that they had there at the tabernacle months later after HIS PASSING THERE'S STATEMENTS THAT are in there that you look at AND YOU THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH BECAUSE HE WAS CATCHING THIS WAS THIS WAS DIFFERENT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IT IT WAS GOD. IT WAS GOD MAKING HIMSELF KNOWN. AND HE SAID, "I'M NOT GLORIFYING BROTHER BRANDHAM, BUT LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK." AS THOUGH OSBORNE COULD SEE THIS. MANY OF THE PENTECOSTALS ALSO SAW, MY WHAT A WHAT A WHAT A GREAT THING. AND YOU EVEN HAVE PEOPLE NOW THAT GO TO THE VERY SAME PLACES IN ARIZONA AND SAY, "THERE IS A CERTAIN FORCE field here. OH, THERE'S SPECIAL THINGS HERE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A GREAT MOVE OF GOD." AND WHAT IT IS, THEY'VE MISSED. YEAH, &gt;&gt; THEY'VE MISSED IT. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID THAT THOSE IN WRITING THE VOICE OF HEALING, HE SAID THIS IS WHY YOU THEY WON'T WRITE ANYTHING EXCEPT FAST AND PRAY, FAST AND PRAY. I'M NOT KNOCKING THOSE PEOPLE, FRIENDS. I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU GOD'S GRACE THAT'S COME TO OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID THEY'RE WRITING PRAY AND FAST, PRAY AND FAST, PRAY AND FAST. A GREAT REVIVAL IS COMING. AND HE SAID THEY HAVE MISSED IT. BUT BY BEING CHRISTIANS, THEY FEEL THE pull of the hour. Yes. &gt;&gt; But by not being of that elect, they miss it. &gt;&gt; It goes over their head to recognize what it's about. &gt;&gt; What about when what about standing in Chicago at the breakfast when every one of them &gt;&gt; it wasn't those men? When you see those kind of things like that, religious traps, I'm not saying that those men were evil, but I'm saying there's an anointing coming from somewhere. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It was the same anointing was on the Pharisees trying to trap the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's why, listen, even when you're talking with someone, witnessing with someone, and you catch it. If they go into debate and argumentative mode, just back off. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a wrong anointing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just back off. You don't have to prove nothing to nobody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's there's a difference, friends. There's a difference when when you can speak to people and you can talk to people and you want to share things. I was fellowshipping with a brother the other the other other night. I said, "Here's a difference." I said, "When there's things to me, I would want somebody to share something with me from the message if I'm not if I've not seen something." I would welcome that. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? I would welcome that. But when you begin to share something with someone say, "Well, I don't believe that. I don't want to receive that." That's a problem. &gt;&gt; There's a problem somewhere. You know what the problem is? The problem's not with man. The problem's with the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this IS NOT BROTHER RAM'S THOUGHTS, BROTHER RAM'S IDEAS. THAT'S WHY I SAID IF SOMEBODY'S GOING TO SAY, "WELL, WE DO THIS AND WE DO THAT." I I'm just going TO SIMPLY ASK YOU, I'M NOT I'M NOT PRIVILEGED. I COULD PREACH MY OWN THOUGHTS, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT WON'T CHANGE YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO, I just simply say, do you have a quote? &gt;&gt; Well, sometimes that gets But I'm asking, do you have a quote? Do you have something you're drawing from? Because don't try to bring Jehovah's Witness and mix it in here. &gt;&gt; Don't try to bring, OH, THE APOSTOLIC, THEY HAD. DON'T TRY TO MIX THAT IN HERE. YOU CAN'T MIX OLD LEAVEN WITH THIS AND IT REMAIN PURE. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; IT'S A PURE MESSAGE BY A PURE SPIRIT THAT BROUGHT A PURE LANGUAGE, THE LANGUAGE OF DIVINE REVELATION. GOD HAS RESTORED THE LANGUAGE TO THE church of the living God. &gt;&gt; The language of atonement, the language of reconciliation. God has restored that language &gt;&gt; to the world. Remember, it's there. As the prophet said, it went and it was unwritten, but God revealed what was written. &gt;&gt; A great light has sprung up. Aren't you glad that light found you? &gt;&gt; We were in darkness. &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LIGHT DID? THE LIGHT DIDN'T JUST COME AND SHINE RIGHT WHERE YOU WERE AND SAY, "HEY, HOW YOU LIKING AROUND HERE?" THE LIGHT COMES TO DO WHAT? LEAD YOU OUT OF DARKNESS INTO NOT JUST LIGHT, [screaming] BUT HIS MARVELOUS LIGHT. NOT JUST A LIGHT THAT WILL LIGHT YOUR SPIRIT WHERE YOU CAN BE LIT FOR JUSTIFICATION, LIT UP FOR SANCTIFICATION, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE OIL [screaming] DOWN IN THE VESSEL. &gt;&gt; AND THAT OIL IS A WISE VIRGIN. IT'S THAT OF HIS MARVELOUS LIGHT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUST TO HAVE A LIGHT OF JUSTIFICATION, it'll go out. Just to have a LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT OF THAT OF SANCTIFICATION, IT'LL GO OUT. &gt;&gt; But it takes the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. the oil of God down on the inside, which is the confirmation of the word. &gt;&gt; That's a vindication. &gt;&gt; It comes to bring you out. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It's still leading you out. &gt;&gt; It's still leading me out. That's why the prophet when he preaches greatest battle ever fought, he says, "Abraham, Abraham's seed, &gt;&gt; come away and live with me. &gt;&gt; Separate from your seed, taste, feel, smell, hear. Separate from your reasoning, CONSCIENCE, MEMORY, AFFECTION. SEPARATE ABRAHAM YOURSELF FROM YOUR KINDRED. COME LIVE WITH ME. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PRIVILEGE. WHEN THE PROPHET WENT AND SPOKE TO THE STORM, WHAT DID WHAT DID THE ANGEL OF THE LORD TELL HIM? COME WALK WITH [screaming] ME. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; What a privilege, friends. &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you, you can't walk with him and your life not be affected. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's a real father. &gt;&gt; He's a real comforter. He's right there alongside our coming right alongside us. He's there to teach us and he shows us things. You say, "Oh, father, forgive me. I didn't Lord, I I see that. I see that flaw in my character." He said, "Here, my son. Remember, greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Just submit yourself to me. Father, give me the discernment I need. Help me to recognize it. Show me how to apply it in my life, LORD. WELL, WHAT IS IT? IT'S HIM, THE COMFORTER. HE WHO IS CALLED ALONGSIDE TO GUIDE US INTO all truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why Peter said, "We have a more sure word of prophecy, &gt;&gt; where unto you do well that you take heed." &gt;&gt; That's good. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this so everybody can relate to this. There were meetings that I had to set in even when I was a teacher that I had to battle. I had to battle just sat there and pinch myself. You know, [laughter] you get up standing in the back of the room if you could and it was just like h just But you know, this is different. It's different even in certain things that you would perk up about. Maybe your hobby, &gt;&gt; your certain thing that is kind of like your groove. This is my groove. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; This is greater than your groove. &gt;&gt; Good preacher. &gt;&gt; This is your position. &gt;&gt; And to take heed unto this word, to be attentive to it, &gt;&gt; to embrace the word to h how do I embrace it? Start with an open heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Start with an open mind. &gt;&gt; Start with an open an openness to the Lord. Lord, I open my life to you. &gt;&gt; I open be it unto me, Lord, according and and and it continues in that way. What? Take heed unto it as unto a light that shineth in a dark place &gt;&gt; until the day day dawn and the day star rise in your hearts. Brother Brandham says it like this in God's wrapped gift. He said, "Precious Lord, there's many, a few women, some young girls that's raised their hands. They don't want to be condemned with the world. They want to receive you now at this Christmas time to look into God's package and receive eternal life." &gt;&gt; Grant it now, Lord, that you'll open to them the forgiveness of their sins. that you'll open to them a fountain in the house of David that's open for sin and uncleanliness where sinners plunge beneath the flood and lose all their guilty stains. Go home with them with them and abide with them tonight, Lord. Make life for them what it should be, Lord. &gt;&gt; Go home with them. How many say, "Yes, Lord. Go home with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Make life what it should be, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Heal the sick and afflicted among us. You're the help of the helpless. I love that. Ye are he, Lord, who can do where others cannot do. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ABIDING GRACE. You are the gift of God. And we humbly believe you, Lord. We follow the day star. We follow the light until it leads us to that perfect light, the gift of God, eternal life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, what the word does is lead us to that promise &gt;&gt; of who he is. &gt;&gt; God with us, &gt;&gt; God in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Emmanuel, &gt;&gt; that portion of God, that which comes into your life and changes your life. &gt;&gt; I want you just to think of it here as as as I close within that. Many looked upon this. Even the shepherds that came, they looked. The angels had made aware to them of what they were to behold and see. And after it was done speaking, they gathered themselves and said, "Let us go see what the angels have proclaimed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what they did? They accepted that word. Yes, &gt;&gt; they believed that word and they acted upon it. &gt;&gt; It it it it was settled. They it now they were coming and you know the first thing they did when they got there is they worshiped. &gt;&gt; They they they worship &gt;&gt; they begin to worship and that announcement that that was given. And I want you to find I want you to see it like this. This is where we look into our own lives like brother Brian if the musicians would come like brother Brian was leading us in that song before I came up here to minister and that song Lord let your word be born in the manger of my heart &gt;&gt; let it live in me &gt;&gt; that's why when we look into our lives the prophet said he said my my pilgrim brother and sister believe that sign &gt;&gt; this end time this evening light look into the manger of your heart and see if you're able to say within yourself, see the sign that the shepherd's seen. &gt;&gt; God in flesh dwelling among the poor, the needy, the offcast. See if you can understand it. God in your heart, God in here. And watch and see if he manifest himself right in sweetness and meekness as he did. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; It's personal, &gt;&gt; right? is to look into our own hearts. And let me just say, if if you can't be honest with God, you won't be honest with nobody. But to be honest with God, and you know, maybe in your life, you can look in your life and say, "I've not had that experience yet." But let me ask you this question. Have you seen the light? Have you have Have you recognized God, there's something there's something different? And if you've really recognized that there's something different here than what you've experienced other places, then here's what here's what to do. Say, "God, reveal yourself to me." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Reveal yourself to me. Or brother, I want to surrender. I'm trying to help you. You sense his presence, something that's real. Now ask him to reveal himself to you. Lord, show me the father. &gt;&gt; And as you and then with that revealing and just now listen, you got to give yourself to it. Remember, Satan's going to try soon as soon as you even come out of these doors. What he's going to try to do, you know, when you take a you take a magnet, we did it when I taught fourth grade. You could take a magnet and if you took that magnet, I've got a whole study on it, but you pound that magnet, throw it on the floor, throw it on the floor, throw it on the floor, and pound it. You know what'll happen? The molecules start getting the arrangements and it's not as strong. You maybe could pick up 10 nails and you mess them. You mess those molecules around in there and they're not lined up. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You may only be able to pick up three barely. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; So you say h how does that magnet get aligned? Well, this is what we would have to do. We would take it and I would teach we were teaching my kids on that. You take a another magnet, what they call a parent magnet. And you take that magnet and you rub it the way it should go. And when you rub it on that magnet the way it should go, it takes all of those those parts molecules that are out of line and it gets it lined up. &gt;&gt; See, that's what God that's what God does for us, friends. &gt;&gt; Sometimes there's a hard trial. It'll literally knock the molecules in your life. It'll it'll send you around in a spin and you and you DON'T YOU'RE NOT AS STRONG AS YOU YOU WAS ONCE AND ONE TIME YET. THE HOLY SPIRIT HASN'T LEFT YOU. BUT what it is, sometimes we get a little bit out of line. Maybe we have from the trial or the test we get out of line. Our our prayer life gets a little weak. Our our attitude or our feet all these other things. It gets a little bit out of line. But isn't it isn't it isn't it tremendous how just coming in the presence of God and the great parent magnet begins to come down on our life. He begins to bring his word and he begins to line up our life and we begin to find strength coming back in our life. Hallelujah. You know what it is? You're becoming reacquainted with the God who's already in the manger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. becoming reacquainted with the God who is already dwelling there on the inside. &gt;&gt; Now listen, &gt;&gt; he wants to be the Lord of all. &gt;&gt; He wants to be the Lord of all. &gt;&gt; So ask him to reveal himself. So God, make yourself real. Don't don't get in a hurry and don't look at nobody else. Just ask him. Lord, like the angels came to the shepherds, I'm one of your shepherds, Lord. Lord, send your messengers to me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Send the angels to me, Lord. Will you say angels? Oh, yes. All the way through the New Testament. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. All the way through the Old Yes. Yes. Lord. Lord, reveal yourself to me. God God knows how to get the message to you. &gt;&gt; See, when you what you you know what you're doing when you're saying that? You're embracing. &gt;&gt; You're opening your heart to it. Lord, reveal yourself to me. And then as he reveals and you find that word just, you know what the word begins to do? It's like &gt;&gt; it begin to draw you in. What do you got ON THE OTHER END OF THAT? AIN'T a minnow. &gt;&gt; I like walleye, but it ain't a walleye. What do you think that is? Seems like by the response it's a rainbow trout. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It &gt;&gt; just seems to be just kind of, you know, taking in the word. And you know what it is? It's Christ. This is what he did in Luke 24. He was gathering. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Was gathering. Don't allow the enemy to knock the things out of you. &gt;&gt; You You're going to have to fight, friends. &gt;&gt; And I know we're all we're all in different places here. This is not what I'm speaking here of just, oh, surrender your heart to God and receive the Holy Ghost. That that's that is the most important thing. But that's not what I'm that's that if that's all you heard today, you've not heard at all. I'm speaking to every one of us. &gt;&gt; Because once he's been born in in the in the manger of your heart, he can't stay a baby in the manger. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He's got to He's got to grow. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; Before other things can BE PRESENTED TO HIM, he's got to grow. &gt;&gt; Got to go from a baby to a young child. Come on now. I can't go there anymore. BUT HE'S GOT TO HE'S GOT TO GROW. AND THEN THAT'S WHY THE WORD, THERE'S PARTS OF THE WORD NOW as you're taking in the word, my it's it's changing you. &gt;&gt; You're looking in a mirror and saying, "Man, I'm not wow. Wow." And you know the things that God's doing, it's greater than any miracle. &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle is a new birth. &gt;&gt; But the miracle that God is changing your character for you to even recognize and submit to it and then for his overcoming grace to work in your life, &gt;&gt; what a miracle. Because you know why &gt;&gt; that can never be taken away from you. &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to go all the way. &gt;&gt; I want to embrace deity. I want to as the prophet said, his return to this earth will be a welcoming &gt;&gt; of the spirit. &gt;&gt; I want I want my heart the cry to be welcome Holy Spirit. Welcome Holy Spirit. So ask God here this morning, friends. Let be very serious. Be very honest with God and ask God, Lord, make yourself real because &gt;&gt; when he begins to reveal himself, it'll affect your walk. It'll it'll start affecting decisions you're making in life. It'll affect it'll affect everything. Start affecting choices in your life. And then from there say, "God, vindicate this in my heart. Vindicate it. Make it real, Lord. Make it positive in me &gt;&gt; that I'm a part of it, Lord." &gt;&gt; But it all starts with revelation. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, &gt;&gt; "You can never overemphasize the importance of revelation." And a closing statement in that portion of the book, he says, "May God give us a fresh revelation &gt;&gt; and by that revelation, we become the living word of God made manifest." &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? No longer God in a manger. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's God in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God in you. God wants to be fully in each of our lives. Let's say Lord welcome Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, oh how we Lord in our hearts are so appreciative for your grace that Lord that you have extended to our lives. Thank you Lord. Lord, so much has been said. So much Lord, you've spoke to our hearts. And Lord, bringing it down that your desire is to reflect what the prophet called the original sign, the eternal sign, the super sign. That's the promise. God with us, God in us, God reflecting his own life through us. Oh Lord Jesus, would you just Lord hear this morning maybe out of John 14 there were those who said yeah that's me Lord they were Lord your prophet I've never got over this and Jehovah Gyra Grass Valley he made this statement he says Lord I have seen such honesty among these people. He said, "It's no telling what you can do where there's honest hearts." Lord, we're in the presence of our heavenly father. You're here to change change our thoughts, change our lives. Maybe there's one here this morning that say, "Lord, that's me. Show us the father. Show me, Lord. Let let me let let me see it. Let it Let let me see, Lord. What I What I know is real. What I sense it's more. Let Let me see you, Lord. Oh, God, reveal yourself to me. And Lord, as you would reveal yourself, Lord, may you come and vindicate your word in me. vindicated through my life. Lord, as your prophet, as he said it to that little sister who was troubled, where an evil spirit was trying to anoint her mind to tell her that she was not able to completely surrender. And the prophet said, "It's just an evil spirit that wants to anoint your thinking." &gt;&gt; But he says, you haven't or else you would not even have have you wouldn't even desire that. But he said, "Here's what to do. Say, Lord, I give my all to you. All that I am, just as I am, I give myself completely to you." We trust you, Lord. It's you. We're in the presence of Elohim. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're in the presence of our malesc. We're in the presence of the deity of almighty God. We're in your presence, Lord. I pray, heavenly father, for every need. There's some of your children, Lord, that even are not here. They're they're battling sickness. Others may be here this morning and they're Lord our it's like they add the monu molecules have been knocked around but Lord would you come the great parent magnet you're here Lord God may you just I pray just take Lord and just line everything back up maybe just Lord even sweeping across hearts and lives that maybe even the enemy Lord would want to try Lord, condemn them for even Lord, maybe the way that maybe they've they've went about or lived or Lord, maybe a lack of faithfulness, Lord. But I pray right now, Father, may the light of God spring up, Lord, right where they're at. and Father to to declare and move upon their hearts to let them see your care for their lives, &gt;&gt; your care for each of our lives, Lord, oh God, to lead us, Lord, into that place of real stability. And I pray, God, &gt;&gt; just come through our lives, Lord. &gt;&gt; We want to be lined up completely with you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to be lined up with you. We want our lives, Lord. It's an individual affair. We want to be lined up, Lord God. Maybe the cares of life, maybe the trials, maybe things, Lord, have tried to just knock things out of us, Lord. But I pray here this morning as we're in your presence. There's just an alignment that's taking place. And it all begins even from our heart to say, "Yes, Lord." The mind accepts the word, then it's believed in the heart, and then it moves throughout the body. Grant, Lord, set every heart, Lord. right in line. Set every one of our thoughts. Set everything all about us, Lord. And Father, even as we're standing here in this this Christmas season, Lord, Lord, we reflect back upon some of these points and these places, but Lord, we're thankful every day of the year &gt;&gt; because Lord, if you had not become one of us, &gt;&gt; where would we be, Lord? Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's that super sign. You became one of us. That original sign that every son and daughter of God would have that same life. Lord, I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you, Lord, that you came. I want to say thank you, Father, that you bore our infirmities. I want to say thank you that you bore our stripes. I want to say thank you for taking the crown of thorns from my mind battles. I want to say thank you father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; for Lord Jesus for all that you have done. You are our complete atonement Lord. Thank you Lord Jesus. And thank you for sending back the Holy Ghost. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. which is not another person but it's the same God. Thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Father for coming into our hearts. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I love how your prophet takes that about a manger. He says it was a a filthy place, a place that was unfit for a king to be born. And he ties that right into where our lives were. Our lives were a stinking mess. But you came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, &gt;&gt; we couldn't straighten our lives up, &gt;&gt; but you came, Lord, you come to us, Lord. And Father, we worship you, Lord. May every one of us, Lord, that are gathered here, those that would be streaming over our archive, may every one of us, Lord, be able to look in and to behold in our own lives the promise of the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for what you did in Brother Brandham, but that was only to point your desire to live in a people. Well, not to do the same things that brother Brandt that Lord that the ministry was for that purpose. It was the prophet himself was a sign, but it was to call us into union with you. Lord, I thank you, Father. I thank you, Lord, that you've anointed our eyes to see. Now, Lord God, I pray right here this morning. I'm asking God for your protection upon every heart, Lord, as this word has been delivered here, Lord. How the enemy would like to try to knock it out, but I pray, Father, there's hearts, Lord, that God, that you would, you've touched and spoken to and are just saying, "I don't want to be a sympathizer. I want to be one with this word. I want to be one with this message that the anointing is with me as it is with others. I want to be one." Grant it, Lord. I pray, God, your protection, Lord, over their hearts and their lives. May you, Lord, as they take this word, may you, may you go with them, Lord, and may that light lead them to that perfect light, Lord, to the day star, till that Lord has so rose in their hearts to where death has passed away. It's a passing unto life. Their lives have been changed, but they're they're seeing that change, Lord. Grant it, Lord. And for every one of us, Lord, changing from glory unto glory, Lord, there's things in our character, my my, as we, Lord, journey up the stature of a perfect man. This is our mountain. Like Caleb said, give me my mountain. This is our mountain. Giants on this mountain, but give me my mountain. Oh Lord, we thank you for your mercy. God, may our faith increase, &gt;&gt; virtue, our patience, knowledge, temperance, brotherly kindness. Oh God, grant it, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Won't you love him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just appreciate him. Brother Brian, lead us, brother, if you don't mind. Walk with me. For you [singing] are worthy. Walk [singing] with me.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we've not we've not come to a manger. &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the east. &gt;&gt; We have seen the supernatural light arise. &gt;&gt; We have witnessed Christ reflected through Malachi 4. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that reflection through Malachi 4 lets us know who we are. &gt;&gt; That's what gave us the courage &gt;&gt; like the 7,000 to stand up and say, "God is still God. &gt;&gt; The promise is mine." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're not just we're not looking back to what God did through Brother Brandham. Now, what we're seeing is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; What we're doing, we're not we're worshiping Christ. We're seeing Christ in his bride body. Emmanuel, the eternal sign, &gt;&gt; the super sign. &gt;&gt; Because it's God living out his life through you and I to where you are not your own. You belong to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you realize it's not I that liveth, but it's Christ that liveth in me. Oh, come let us adore him. &gt;&gt; Not I that liveth, but Christ that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. So, we're not worshiping Christ in a manger. It's Christ in our heart. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. We're worshiping the living God. Now, let me tell you, YOU MIGHT WORSHIP HIM FOR SAVING YOU FROM your sins, BUT KEEP WORSHIPING HIM. WORSHIP HIM UNTIL HE CLEANSES YOU AND SANCTIFIES YOU. KEEP WORSHIPING HIM UNTIL HE FEELS YOU. KEEP WORSHIPING HIM BECAUSE HE ALONE is worthy. He has made unto us redemption, sanctification, wisdom, all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many could say amen? This word &gt;&gt; has power, has power, has glory, has authority. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; EMBRACE THIS DEITY. THE DEITY OF JESUS CHRIST. EMBRACE THE HOLY GHOST. EMBRACE THE WORD made flesh. &gt;&gt; And now you are the word &gt;&gt; made flesh in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to know why God sent the message? &gt;&gt; This is why God sent the message. &gt;&gt; When you stop and think just for a moment how the message found you, you'd think it's a paradox. How did the message find me? How did it ever make it to my doorstep? How did it ever get to me? How did it ever come across my path? It's because God came looking for you. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT LITTLE EAGLE. &gt;&gt; You might HAVE BEEN IN A CHICKEN YARD, but he knew you were always his. And that's why the word, this word means something to you that's different from anything else. THIS WORD HAS AN EFFECT ON YOU THAT YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM BECAUSE IT'S THE INSPIRATION [screaming] OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THIS HOUR. IT'S EMMANUEL, God with us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I worship him for CHANGING LIVES. &gt;&gt; I WORSHIP HIM FOR CHANGING MY LIFE. I WORSHIP HIM FOR CHANGING my character. I worship him. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; My goodness. GLORY BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD JESUS. &gt;&gt; WHAT A PARADOX. &gt;&gt; WHAT GRACE HAS COME TO US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS SEVEN ANGELS CAME TO THE PROPHET, THE ANGELS OF GOD THAT ACCOMPANIED THIS MESSAGE HAVE COME TO STIR OUR HEARTS AND DRAW US INTO &gt;&gt; THIS WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say, "How did I get here?" The same angel that beat Eleazar there a half hour &gt;&gt; before he got there and began to stir Rebecca's heart. God has the angels dispatched in this hour. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "You could sit here hearing the word preach." And he said, "You're hearing this.
