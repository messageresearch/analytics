[40:38] and he is the propitiation for our sins
[40:44] would perpetuation is one who Proficio
[40:47] eighths or the atoning one the atonement
[40:52] so he is I want you to this is careful
[40:55] here he is not was is is is his present
[41:05] tense
[41:06] he is the perpetuation for our sins and
[41:10] not for ours only but also for the sins
[41:14] of the whole world
[41:17] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[41:19] of the word as you're being seated I
[41:21] want to take that thought this morning
[41:26] and we'll just see where the Lord lets
[41:30] us get to sometimes it's so hard well
[41:34] we'll just we'll see how the Lord lets
[41:36] us go within this here but I'd like to
[41:38] speak to you this morning on the
[41:40] advocate of the believer and and we've
[41:43] been dealing with the promise of the
[41:45] father what is the Holy Ghost and
[41:48] brother Branham would would take this in
[41:51] the message what is the Holy Ghost and
[41:53] this when he's just going through and
[41:55] laying down what the Holy Ghost is and
[41:57] he takes this and and he deals with this
[42:01] just for a little just for a little bit
[42:02] and I believe that as the Spirit of God
[42:06] would make it real to our hearts because
[42:09] we realized that with the light that has
[42:13] come upon the word in the hour that
[42:15] we're living it is not the light of
[42:19] man's understanding but it is the light
[42:23] of God coming up on the word that's
[42:26] needed for us in this hour in order for
[42:30] that translation to take place because
[42:33] God's desire within our life this is a
[42:36] promise he said will I find faith when I
[42:40] returned to the earth now he wasn't
[42:43] looking you know for churches even
[42:45] though we thank God for churches but to
[42:48] recognize that he
[42:50] he was looking for faith it would be
[42:52] that faith that even Jude would would
[42:55] write about the faith that was once
[42:57] delivered to the Saints that were to
[42:59] contend for that faith and that faith is
[43:03] not is not the the faith of a man or a
[43:07] man but that's the faith of God moving
[43:10] in man and so that's what it is that
[43:13] when we can recognize that that when we
[43:17] look at even Abraham and Sarah and see
[43:19] and we find this in the scripture it all
[43:22] goes back and forth through the
[43:23] scripture that of how God will deal with
[43:26] one to an age and God makes himself
[43:30] known then that one comes and ministers
[43:34] by the faith of God that promise over
[43:38] the people of God and the people of God
[43:41] then rising in that faith and then it
[43:46] becomes the same faith that has moved
[43:48] through the messenger carrying the
[43:51] message from the throne of God then the
[43:53] people of God operate by that same faith
[43:57] to fulfill what the message has called
[44:01] for so it is not if I could say it like
[44:04] this it is not us as the people who are
[44:07] fulfilling the word it is Christ in us
[44:12] fulfilling what he already said and what
[44:17] he has already laid out in his mind this
[44:21] is not a script that is good that has
[44:24] been wrote where there are editing marks
[44:28] now where there's things oh well we may
[44:30] be needed to rethink this or we need to
[44:32] know this has already been from the mind
[44:35] of God before it ever came into print it
[44:40] was already in God's mind the the Bible
[44:44] clearly declares in in the book of Peter
[44:46] that that there were holy men of old it
[44:49] wasn't that their flesh was holy but the
[44:52] Bible says there were holy men of old
[44:54] and holy mean that they were separated
[44:57] unto God they were separated from their
[45:01] thoughts from
[45:02] thinking matter of fact they were so
[45:04] separated that they they were so on that
[45:08] they spoke as God for even when the
[45:11] Elijah would say it will not not rain or
[45:13] Dew will fall from the sky until I call
[45:16] for it he spoke as God why because he
[45:19] was living in the presence of Almighty
[45:22] God to where God was able to move and to
[45:26] take over the faculties of Elijah as a
[45:30] type of what God would do in Christ and
[45:33] what God does in the believer hi mama
[45:39] mama I tell you I just feel good you see
[45:42] when we look at this the situation when
[45:45] you you you think of that with Elijah
[45:47] and Elijah look the humanity was still
[45:50] there so you and I could relate to it
[45:53] but yet when Elijah and Elijah both come
[45:56] to situations where there is death
[45:58] before them we see the miracles that
[46:00] were done but let's look at the dead
[46:02] babies there was that in Elijah's day
[46:04] there was that in Elijah's day so there
[46:07] was that of a child that needed to be
[46:10] raised to life and and both of them in
[46:14] in separate instances they did not know
[46:16] what to do in that moment but they knew
[46:20] this is what's important they knew that
[46:23] the Lord Jesus the one who had spoke to
[46:26] them Almighty God they knew he was the
[46:30] answer and so when they came into the
[46:33] room remember in I just closed the door
[46:36] behind him Elijah did the same thing
[46:38] they and they begin to move around upon
[46:41] the floor then the inspiration struck of
[46:45] what was already laying there in their
[46:48] in their bosom and they went and laid
[46:51] themselves up all the child
[46:53] Elijah laid himself upon the child
[46:55] nose-to-nose mouth to mouth everything
[46:58] was right on and and and he was the
[47:01] Spirit of God that moved that brought
[47:04] death to life and you and you look at it
[47:08] in this hour listen now it was not
[47:10] Elijah that
[47:12] raised up that man but Elijah was one
[47:14] who was yielded to the Spirit of God and
[47:18] God took over Elijah in that moment and
[47:22] that's the same way in enlasa you see
[47:25] Elijah had an example of how that God
[47:28] could so take over a man like Elijah -
[47:32] wherein Elijah would make the same
[47:34] request he said I want a double portion
[47:36] of that spirit he desired what I want to
[47:40] be fully taken over in my life like God
[47:44] took Elijah over and a situation
[47:46] presented itself death was present
[47:49] Elijah didn't know what to do but he
[47:52] walked and he gave himself to the Lord
[47:54] and here he moves upon that child and
[47:57] notice then when he when he moves upon
[48:00] that child then that child that was dead
[48:02] it comes back to life why because unless
[48:06] you surrendered himself to God and it
[48:09] was God that brought Deborah life where
[48:12] there was death and I said just like
[48:15] this that's exactly what the baptism of
[48:19] the Holy Ghost it does and is in the
[48:21] life of a believer he deals with the
[48:24] life calling a life in justification
[48:27] what's in dirt he's starting to take
[48:28] over he calls it in sanctification he's
[48:31] taken over he moves to the baptism of
[48:34] the Holy Ghost where he sets down on the
[48:37] throne of your heart and he has fully
[48:40] taken over you are no longer your own
[48:44] you realize I've been bought with a
[48:48] price I'm not my own I belong to him
[48:54] I'm certainly not going to ask you
[48:56] because every one of us can identify
[48:58] with this we all not only have been
[49:01] maybe some are maybe some will be where
[49:04] Elijah and Elijah were where there were
[49:08] needs that are present and you don't
[49:11] know what to do but this is what I want
[49:13] you to take from this here
[49:15] they closed the door behind them there's
[49:19] times you got to shut everything not
[49:20] just times you got to shut everything of
[49:22] the world out sometimes you know it'd be
[49:25] easy just to close the door and shut
[49:27] everybody else out but really everybody
[49:29] else ain't the problem it's our mind if
[49:33] we could somehow get in there and go and
[49:35] just turn it off like that
[49:37] you know I mean if we had like pocket
[49:39] doors closing that's really the shutting
[49:43] away and you see God he makes a way for
[49:50] you and I that that you and I as we come
[49:53] into those times we come into tests we
[49:56] come in to try we don't know what to do
[49:58] in those times but here's what is
[50:00] important is that you know in whom you
[50:03] have believed you know that he is the
[50:06] one that's got a hold of your life it's
[50:09] not so much you've got a hold of him
[50:11] he's got a hold of you and you're aware
[50:14] that there is one in the ship that is
[50:17] here in my time of need I may not know
[50:21] what to do right now but the answer is
[50:23] already here well what's the answer it's
[50:26] here because the answer is not just
[50:28] something out here the answer is the
[50:31] person of Jesus Christ amen
[50:35] so when we look at this here my goodness
[50:38] I tell you what man well listen you know
[50:41] that that was all free the believers
[50:45] advocate the advocate of the believer
[50:47] you know to think of this for you and I
[50:50] that that we have an advocate and I I
[50:52] just pray that God will help us to be
[50:55] able to bring this to a place this
[50:57] morning and I I don't want to keep you
[50:58] here all day and I know some of you may
[51:01] disagree with that you might think I
[51:03] like keeping you here all day but I
[51:04] don't want to do that I want you to get
[51:07] what needs to be got today and if we got
[51:09] to come with we got to continue on we'll
[51:11] do it on another time but but here's the
[51:14] thing the Bible is clear within this
[51:17] word advocate what I want you to
[51:19] understand and I know you do as Bible
[51:21] readers but the word advocate is the
[51:23] promise that Jesus made
[51:26] when he was here he said I will not
[51:28] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[51:32] again but he did not come back to them
[51:35] in a physical form we know he raised
[51:37] from the grave he walked around here but
[51:40] yet then he ascended to the throne of
[51:43] God to the mercy seat and he now comes
[51:45] back in the form of the Holy Ghost
[51:48] the same God that dwelt within that life
[51:51] and that body he said I will come to you
[51:54] I will not leave you comfortless in
[51:56] other words I won't leave you as orphans
[52:01] you're not going to understand what's
[52:03] going on Ben right now but you will
[52:06] understand it in time and it'll be
[52:09] important that you understand it then
[52:11] because it will work that faith will
[52:14] operate within your life not when when
[52:17] we when we when we look at this the word
[52:19] advocate itself jesus said that I will
[52:22] send the comforter unto you the same
[52:25] word comforter is the same word advocate
[52:28] they are the exact same words so now
[52:32] notice John I want you to watch here
[52:34] I've got to lay this sin in it in here
[52:37] today because it's important to see this
[52:40] right here it says my children these
[52:42] things write unto you that ye sin not
[52:44] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[52:47] with the father Jesus Christ the
[52:50] righteous he is the propitiation for our
[52:53] sins and not for ours only but also for
[52:56] the sins of the whole world so the word
[52:58] advocate here is that of Parakletos
[53:01] which is comforter it's one who is
[53:04] summons to the side that has come to
[53:07] once a to plead our cause now I don't
[53:11] want you to get confused with plead as
[53:13] though somebody is beggin it's not a
[53:18] beggin Jesus didn't beg the pleading is
[53:23] to have what is needed and necessary in
[53:27] order to satisfy the requirements that
[53:31] have been made so he has what is he
[53:35] himself what is needed in order
[53:39] to plead our case oh my and he stands
[53:43] and as is there to intercede on our
[53:47] behalf
[53:47] now when we think of this you know you
[53:51] know no doubt for many of us we have
[53:52] examples of people and I'm not monk now
[53:55] on the on the general level who would
[53:57] stand in as advocates on our behalf we
[53:59] have things you know that I remember
[54:02] when things would take place in in and
[54:04] in the school setting well you know when
[54:06] when something had been done testing or
[54:08] whatever more and a student would
[54:10] require some other services some of the
[54:13] teachers and different ones know that
[54:15] sister Nita different ones that's been
[54:16] involved with that you you have people
[54:18] that come on board when you meet with
[54:20] the principal and everybody else and you
[54:22] as the teacher you've got parents there
[54:24] but you see the parents and the students
[54:26] don't know what their rights are they
[54:29] don't know what what it actually belongs
[54:32] to them but there is an advocate who is
[54:35] trained this is what they do for a
[54:37] living they are trained they know the
[54:40] laws they also know what accommodations
[54:44] should be given for that student or for
[54:46] that child it's just like with your
[54:48] Union stewards and you know forgive me I
[54:51] don't want to take you to work right now
[54:52] but you know you should have and we
[54:55] understand that door don't try to get
[54:57] all caught up in that thing
[54:58] well I need a different unions to her
[54:59] just just just bear with me a moment I'm
[55:01] just trying to give an example a union
[55:03] steward somebody who would actually be
[55:06] there to represent you who actually is
[55:09] there and and Antanas blue-lipped with
[55:11] the administration and what's taking
[55:12] place they know the things that are
[55:15] given to you they know of the rights
[55:18] that are given to you and and that in
[55:20] itself is here just on a or just on a
[55:24] small level you know an advocate I think
[55:27] of where you know with certain things
[55:29] that would take place in school there's
[55:31] things you know about it that a teacher
[55:33] not knowing they can say well this child
[55:36] is going to stay after at this time or
[55:39] whatever more but when certain things
[55:40] fall certain degrees get into
[55:43] documentation there they're there you
[55:45] cannot do that because they must be able
[55:47] to be on transportation going on the way
[55:50] home you
[55:51] what it is it's rights that's given to
[55:53] them so you can't say I'm holding you
[55:55] after school
[55:55] there are rights that are given by that
[55:57] document that ties them in to the
[55:59] federal government and that advocate can
[56:02] stand there and if somebody overrides it
[56:04] and I'll tell you what then next morning
[56:06] in the principal's office and that
[56:08] teachers gonna be down there as well
[56:09] they're the advocate that represents
[56:12] that child is going to be there
[56:14] the child does not have to be in that
[56:16] meeting the advocate is the one who
[56:18] stands there for what the child where
[56:21] the wrong has been done the advocate
[56:23] stands there let me just tell you
[56:25] something Jesus Christ the righteous is
[56:28] not there challenging their the Father
[56:30] but to understand his blood stands there
[56:34] as a witness to the devil to the accuser
[56:37] that the pardon has already been paid
[56:40] and what you are trying to accuse them
[56:43] of the pardon has already went forward
[56:46] and I'm standing here as their advocate
[56:50] there is blood on the mercy seat
[56:54] [Applause]
[56:56] [Music]
[56:57] hallelujah he becomes our advocate oh my
[57:02] I love this scripture here and in
[57:06] lamentations 3 here you find that
[57:10] Jeremiah moved by inspiration and he all
[57:13] the way through lamentations here he is
[57:15] praying and how the greatness was of
[57:18] Jerusalem and how they fell and they
[57:20] went into bondage they went into
[57:22] captivity and the city that was once
[57:24] full of joy is now full of desolation
[57:27] and and Jeremiah is recounting all this
[57:30] but him but he gets to about the middle
[57:32] of chapter 3 Jeremiah begins to be moved
[57:37] by the Spirit of God to forget not his
[57:40] tender mercies he begins to write under
[57:43] inspiration his mercies are new every
[57:46] morning you see God cannot forget his
[57:51] word he's not altering and there's
[57:55] nothing that you and I can do there's
[57:57] nothing that can be done to make our
[58:00] acceptable but there's only one in whom
[58:04] that we can be accepted in and that's in
[58:07] the beloved so the notice how that I
[58:10] love this in verse 57 it says thou drew
[58:14] us near in the day that I called upon
[58:16] thee thou settest oh my I feel like
[58:19] preaching thou set us fear not to my
[58:23] very men think about this here when the
[58:27] call was made to remind know what's here
[58:29] my is standing in has one that's
[58:32] representing on behalf of Israel and
[58:35] he's making that request he is actually
[58:38] taking upon and weeping you know we call
[58:41] Jeremiah the weeping prophet he is
[58:43] weeping but remember it is not a man's
[58:46] emotions that is weeping it is the
[58:48] Spirit of Christ inside of Jeremiah that
[58:52] is weeping and is recalling that word
[58:55] and here's your Maya he says when I
[58:58] begin to pray you know the Bible says
[59:00] that he says that when he says you shall
[59:03] begin to seek me you shall begin to
[59:06] hearken unto me and when you begin to
[59:09] cuddle me in prayer I will hear your
[59:12] prayer amen when you begin to seek me
[59:16] with your whole heart I will be found of
[59:18] you I'll tell you right now friends it's
[59:22] it's one thing we can come to church and
[59:25] I I believe that this is a place that
[59:27] that we need to find relief we need to
[59:30] find rest we need to find help we need
[59:33] to find strength but I just want to also
[59:36] that we would be very mindful that God
[59:39] desires more than just to give us
[59:42] temporary relief he wants to give rest
[59:46] Savio's he wants to give rest to our
[59:49] soul to wear that with inside in our
[59:52] life there is a rest and and too so so
[59:56] position us to where our faith is
[59:59] resting in him amen at times that's
[1:00:04] where that we need that of the word
[1:00:07] that's why listen to me this is why you
[1:00:09] would find word brother Branham dealing
[1:00:11] with different
[1:00:12] one's in the message and I think you
[1:00:14] know what you find it in different place
[1:00:16] in a message but I think I've even
[1:00:17] brother Welch Evans coming to him and
[1:00:20] you know brother Welch questioning
[1:00:22] whether he had the Holy Ghost or not and
[1:00:24] he said brother branham he said I never
[1:00:25] got it straight until I heard you teach
[1:00:29] on Hebrews 10 he said and when you've
[1:00:32] made that declaration that that the
[1:00:34] worshipper once purged has no more
[1:00:37] desire of sin he said then I seen it the
[1:00:43] experience of passing from death unto
[1:00:46] life so our experience is a word
[1:00:49] experience in order be to God aren't you
[1:00:54] glad for that because look that how else
[1:00:57] can we have faith faith cometh by
[1:00:59] hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[1:01:01] so it's got to be a faith that's resting
[1:01:04] in the Word of God and we rest in the
[1:01:06] word and God makes his word alive and
[1:01:09] makes it real he makes it sure to us
[1:01:12] personally
[1:01:13] oh my momma I think I just feel like
[1:01:16] preaching you say what are you doing
[1:01:17] well I don't know I'm trying to verse 57
[1:01:19] thou drew us near I love that the Bible
[1:01:24] said in the book of James draw nigh unto
[1:01:27] God and He will draw not unto you well
[1:01:33] let's just preach on sons and daughters
[1:01:35] right now here is Israel all the way
[1:01:38] through the Old Testament prophecies I
[1:01:40] just love it
[1:01:41] you find of how here they are scattered
[1:01:44] all around throughout all the places and
[1:01:46] they've been scattered because of
[1:01:49] unbelief
[1:01:49] oh my you see what unbelief does it
[1:01:52] scatters it break it breaks unity but
[1:01:55] when God begins to move by his promise
[1:01:58] in order to bring things back in harmony
[1:02:01] with his word God takes that which is
[1:02:04] scattered by unbelief but my belief in
[1:02:07] his word God brings unity it begins to
[1:02:12] bring things back together like he could
[1:02:15] say in Isaiah 43 it says I would say to
[1:02:19] the north give up my sons I say to the
[1:02:22] south give up my daughters I say to the
[1:02:25] east
[1:02:25] say to the list notice God is calling it
[1:02:29] it is supernatural that sounding of
[1:02:32] God's trumpet voice that calls Israel
[1:02:35] back in her homeland and it's the same
[1:02:38] way with you and I it is the
[1:02:40] supernatural sounding of the voice of
[1:02:43] Almighty God that says to the North give
[1:02:46] up my sons to the South give up my
[1:02:49] daughters to they east and to the west
[1:02:51] we have not been assembled here but that
[1:02:54] of man I tell you ought to put that
[1:02:56] right in the devil States right now this
[1:02:58] morning you are not here by the call of
[1:03:00] man you're not here by accident you are
[1:03:04] here by coordination of Almighty God and
[1:03:07] God has called to your heart hallelu but
[1:03:16] 7 you don't know take that word and put
[1:03:18] it in his face now drew us near in the
[1:03:24] day that I call upon thee whoo it's like
[1:03:30] the prodigal down there he had he had
[1:03:32] all types of stuff all over him but you
[1:03:34] know what he began to draw near he smelt
[1:03:39] like a massive look like a mess but he
[1:03:41] began to draw near he was drawing near
[1:03:45] you remember drum man to God he'll draw
[1:03:47] nigh to you the Bible said that he said
[1:03:50] fear not
[1:03:50] oh my so there's a reason there's a
[1:03:54] reason I can say fear not in verse 58 oh
[1:03:58] look how this is capital L lowercase o
[1:04:02] lowercase R lowercase D adenine Oh Lord
[1:04:06] thou has pleaded the calls of my soul
[1:04:09] this word is used in relation to
[1:04:11] humanity Oh Lord thou has pleaded the
[1:04:15] causes of my soul thou has redeemed my
[1:04:19] life redemption is not according to how
[1:04:25] that man's mind has wanted now to
[1:04:29] conceive it and I don't want to say that
[1:04:31] they concede that that way down through
[1:04:33] the ages but it has
[1:04:35] slowly been lost the real reality of
[1:04:38] what true predestination is all about
[1:04:42] predestination is not that well I was a
[1:04:45] sinner on my way to hell but you know
[1:04:47] Jesus just had pity and mercy and he
[1:04:50] just hoped that I would turn around
[1:04:51] brother that's a reckless program that
[1:04:55] is not Redemption Redemption is coming
[1:04:59] to claim and bring back what always
[1:05:02] bound to you we were not we were not
[1:05:06] pigs become sheep
[1:05:08] we were always sheep but we had to have
[1:05:12] the quickening power to come upon our
[1:05:15] lives that would change us and move away
[1:05:18] that old nature that the real sheep and
[1:05:21] lamb of God on the inside to come up who
[1:05:25] can do that but V Lamb of God the chief
[1:05:30] Shepherd and Bishop of our soul oh my
[1:05:35] that has redeemed my life oh ma that's
[1:05:40] not an option
[1:05:42] that is essential that is essential in
[1:05:46] our life see this is what it comes down
[1:05:49] to the ministering of the gospel is
[1:05:51] preaching the rights that belong to us
[1:05:55] as believers you're not you're not
[1:05:58] willing I get good enough no sonship and
[1:06:00] as the Sun and as a daughter
[1:06:03] what is ministered to us is what belongs
[1:06:06] to us
[1:06:07] it was always ours it was ours clear
[1:06:10] from before the foundation of the world
[1:06:12] but remember there has been a robbery
[1:06:15] that took place there was unbelief that
[1:06:17] came in they went there we were sold out
[1:06:20] into sin we were represented by one
[1:06:23] madam come on Romans five but now there
[1:06:25] had to be one come around and represent
[1:06:28] us in righteousness in order to bring us
[1:06:31] back to where that we had fallen from
[1:06:34] and ministered to us our rights this is
[1:06:38] what the advocate does the Holy Ghost
[1:06:41] the spirit of
[1:06:42] sent back into the Church of the Living
[1:06:45] car to continue this work in ministers
[1:06:48] to you and I are rats you could be
[1:06:50] setting here this morning and you might
[1:06:52] have you know your understanding of
[1:06:54] healing well I'm just going to suffer
[1:06:56] for the glory of God but the advocate
[1:06:58] comes and lets you know that by my
[1:07:00] stripes you are healed the advocate lets
[1:07:03] you know I am the lord that healers all
[1:07:05] that diseases they advocate lets you
[1:07:08] know that I desire that you would be in
[1:07:10] health and prosper even as thy soul does
[1:07:13] prosper this is what the advocate does
[1:07:16] it comes to minister to you and I where
[1:07:18] the enemy wants to rob and steal and
[1:07:21] take away the privileges but the living
[1:07:24] Lord Jesus Christ he comes and lets us
[1:07:27] know as a son and daughter of God you're
[1:07:29] living beneath your privileges you need
[1:07:31] to rise up and you need to take what
[1:07:34] belongs to you and the first thing he
[1:07:36] has to tell us is fear not mother lujah
[1:07:48] that's the first words john heard on the
[1:07:53] Isle of Patmos fear not jump said I fell
[1:07:57] at his feet as dead what the words come
[1:08:02] fear not I am he that was dead in him
[1:08:09] alive forevermore
[1:08:12] and I've got the keys hey men I am the
[1:08:17] victory amen
[1:08:22] he stood right there and he ministers to
[1:08:25] John as the prophet would say it left
[1:08:27] courage and ability I love it
[1:08:32] those three orders love because without
[1:08:35] left there could be no faith left
[1:08:37] produces faith not cast out fear so must
[1:08:43] be left that's the order its wrote in
[1:08:44] Ezra minute love courage and ability
[1:08:47] that's what the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:08:50] Christ he comes to minister how can he
[1:08:53] do that because he is speaking to his
[1:08:55] sons and his daughters that is the
[1:08:58] promise from the Old Testament politics
[1:09:01] enough in Hebrews to that I will sing
[1:09:04] and declare thy name in the midst of the
[1:09:07] church in the midst of my brethren will
[1:09:10] i exalt that name o God they meant to
[1:09:14] lift up the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:17] Christ in that name amen every devil is
[1:09:20] defeated in that name every devil has to
[1:09:24] turn lose it's in that name that they
[1:09:26] shall heal the sin in my name they shall
[1:09:29] cast out devils it is that name that
[1:09:32] manifestation of the very life of
[1:09:35] Almighty God it is what brings
[1:09:37] prevailing power to the Church of the
[1:09:40] Living God what is it the name of God it
[1:09:43] is all hallelujah it's the name of God
[1:09:46] that removes your reproach it's the name
[1:09:48] of God that removes blaspheming where
[1:09:53] the name has been blaspheme but when he
[1:09:56] comes brother
[1:09:57] he manifests his name it takes away all
[1:10:00] of the blasphemous accusations and all
[1:10:04] of their approach why he is calling you
[1:10:07] by his name whoo
[1:10:13] I feel like preaching
[1:10:16] oh you say brother Sam you just a nut
[1:10:22] hey this is what brings me joy I don't
[1:10:26] act no different at home than what I act
[1:10:28] here now that I'm not saying you got to
[1:10:30] act like maybe that's just my
[1:10:31] peculiarities if you're embarrassed with
[1:10:33] me just close your eyes and say thank
[1:10:34] you Jesus for your word but this is my
[1:10:39] life this is my joy amen it's my joy to
[1:10:44] look in upon these things because it is
[1:10:47] personal to you and I notice this my
[1:10:50] verse 59 o Lord thou has seen my wrong
[1:10:57] judge Val my cause notice Lord capital L
[1:11:03] capital o capital R capital D Jehovah
[1:11:07] you hold the self-existing one one who
[1:11:11] now remember as he reveals himself one
[1:11:14] who exists not with his family he who is
[1:11:18] his family are you with me
[1:11:22] when God thought of becoming tangible
[1:11:29] hallelujah he thought when he started
[1:11:32] becoming tangible he thought of you and
[1:11:34] me he wanted to have fellowship he
[1:11:40] wanted to have fellowship remember Adam
[1:11:43] could not have fellowship with all the
[1:11:45] other living creatures that were there
[1:11:48] no doubt it was nice to pet the horse or
[1:11:51] the lion's mane or whatever more but he
[1:11:53] could not have fellowship with those
[1:11:55] animals but there had to be one of his
[1:11:59] own kind one that he could have
[1:12:02] fellowship one that he could have
[1:12:04] communion with one that he could share
[1:12:07] his own life in his own substance one
[1:12:11] that could walk walk in that place with
[1:12:16] him you see the Lord Jesus has longed
[1:12:21] and waited for the time to come back as
[1:12:25] sons and daughters of God coming back
[1:12:27] into fellowship with
[1:12:29] says his children and he is loaned for
[1:12:33] the day when there is that uniting when
[1:12:36] this veil of flesh is finally dropped
[1:12:39] from our lives and we step from this
[1:12:41] mortality into that immortality he's
[1:12:45] made away he's made away for all of it
[1:12:48] he's got everything planned out so Oh
[1:12:50] Lord notice here on that verse 58 once
[1:12:53] again Oh Lord thou has pleaded the
[1:12:56] causes of my soul aren't you glad he
[1:12:59] done that for you thou hast redeemed my
[1:13:04] life Oh Lord thou has seen my wrong
[1:13:08] judge now my call so he didn't ignore
[1:13:11] the wrong but remember there was a plea
[1:13:13] that came up here's the wrong there is a
[1:13:17] plea that came up and there is the One
[1:13:20] God coming down and becoming kinsmen in
[1:13:23] order to bring the plea that was needed
[1:13:27] to satisfy what guilt was against us the
[1:13:32] Bible would say like this I want to lay
[1:13:33] these scriptures in and I don't want to
[1:13:35] run through but I want to get through it
[1:13:37] in Hebrews 7 verse 25 wherefore he is
[1:13:41] able also to save them to the uttermost
[1:13:44] that come unto God by him seeing he ever
[1:13:49] liveth to make intercession for them oh
[1:13:54] my you're not powerful that scripture is
[1:13:58] that the Bible would say and in another
[1:14:00] place in the book of Romans that while
[1:14:02] we were yet sinners Christ loved us and
[1:14:07] died for us he meant minhwan we were yet
[1:14:11] sinners we were ungodly there was
[1:14:13] nothing about us as far as what could be
[1:14:16] seen that actually could be lovable but
[1:14:20] God knew that there is a love that needs
[1:14:23] to be dispensed and when that love is
[1:14:26] dispensed I'm talking about his life the
[1:14:28] love of God is the Holy Ghost when that
[1:14:31] is dispensed into that life it will
[1:14:34] raise up a son and daughter of God
[1:14:36] they're down there beneath all the mud
[1:14:38] in the
[1:14:39] that's packed in them there down beneath
[1:14:41] that part there down beneath that water
[1:14:43] of humanity but when the light has come
[1:14:46] it begins to move up that pond Lily
[1:14:49] what's it do it
[1:14:50] it's pressing it's pressing where is it
[1:14:53] getting the strength it's getting the
[1:14:55] strength from one that is above it that
[1:14:57] is generating the power that's needed in
[1:15:01] order to come above the waters
[1:15:05] hallelujah
[1:15:06] though this world has failed we've all
[1:15:09] sinned and it's in the Bible says that
[1:15:11] the waters are the thickness and
[1:15:14] multitudes of people and spirits are
[1:15:17] permeating everywhere but the mercy of
[1:15:19] all muddy cult to move down and draw us
[1:15:25] to himself he ever liveth let me just
[1:15:32] say maybe there's one here or streaming
[1:15:36] or we'll hear this you might have been
[1:15:38] one who've been in and out in and out
[1:15:43] let me just tell you something I may
[1:15:46] give you the direct words the messenger
[1:15:49] brought us in this hour
[1:15:50] he said he sets there to sympathize with
[1:15:53] you he said you go he said back and
[1:15:57] forth he said but he stays there for you
[1:16:00] and what he does he invites you to come
[1:16:04] back are you with me
[1:16:08] not just where temporary relief you see
[1:16:10] he's holding there for you and I and
[1:16:13] that sympathizing with us listen to me
[1:16:15] now that isn't that in well you know how
[1:16:18] long is that going to be
[1:16:19] I don't know God's only obligated to
[1:16:21] give every person one opportunity so to
[1:16:25] see that he ever liveth to make
[1:16:27] intercession he's there to move upon on
[1:16:31] the behalf of that word let me just say
[1:16:33] something there could have been a son
[1:16:35] and daughter of God they could be in and
[1:16:37] out and in and out for years when I'm
[1:16:41] just gonna preach but I'll tell you this
[1:16:43] right here the Bible says he ever liveth
[1:16:46] to make intercession if they belong to
[1:16:48] him they're a son and daughter of God
[1:16:50] brother
[1:16:50] he ain't leavin hook behind he ain't
[1:16:54] gonna altar and say hey you know what I
[1:16:56] made one too many wedding garments hey
[1:16:58] you know what change the name tag on
[1:17:00] that plate right there we need to move
[1:17:02] that no sir
[1:17:03] that name is already there that name is
[1:17:06] a matter of fact he's already redeemed
[1:17:08] to the Holy Ghost makes real to you
[1:17:12] the redemption of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:15] he lets you know your place is secure
[1:17:18] it's always been secured how no wonder
[1:17:29] David can say I'm just gonna follow this
[1:17:30] no wonder David could say that in the
[1:17:33] presence of mine enemy he had prepared a
[1:17:36] table for me he half a nut in my head
[1:17:40] with oil and my cup runneth over let me
[1:17:45] tell you something you are not going to
[1:17:48] a wedding as a guest you are part of the
[1:17:53] wedding
[1:17:55] you're not sitting at a guest table your
[1:17:58] seat has already been reserved
[1:18:01] [Applause]
[1:18:05] gourry the mother of the sons of thunder
[1:18:10] Zebedee she asked him she said yeah I
[1:18:14] would like you to grant my sons to sit
[1:18:16] on that rock and all that left and Jesus
[1:18:18] said he asked him he said are you able
[1:18:21] to drink that which huh and that ties
[1:18:23] with they said we are he said you shall
[1:18:25] be he said but that place to give it's
[1:18:28] not mine it's already been given it's
[1:18:33] already been given but the Holy Ghost
[1:18:36] goes to call us to recognize our
[1:18:38] position we're not acting like the Queen
[1:18:41] of Heaven because we got a title it is
[1:18:44] the life within us that lets everybody
[1:18:46] else know that this is his pride how she
[1:18:51] conducts herself the life that she lives
[1:18:55] is not because I want to sit there at
[1:18:58] that place it's because the reality of
[1:19:01] that position has moved into our hearts
[1:19:04] that's why we do what we do hallelujah
[1:19:11] Oh glory be to God verse 26 for such an
[1:19:18] high priest became us now Paul's talking
[1:19:23] about this Melchizedek that's such a
[1:19:26] high priest became us who is holy
[1:19:33] harmless undefiled separate from sinners
[1:19:38] and made higher than the heavens who
[1:19:42] needeth not daily as those priests to
[1:19:46] offer up sacrifice first for his own
[1:19:49] sins and then for the peoples for this
[1:19:51] he did once when he offered up himself
[1:19:57] for the law maketh man high priests
[1:19:59] which have infirmity but the word of the
[1:20:03] oath which was sense the law maketh the
[1:20:07] son
[1:20:08] who is consecrated forevermore
[1:20:11] so according then to the word now the
[1:20:15] word of the old God swore by an oath is
[1:20:19] that right God and it think how Paul
[1:20:22] would write that I love that Paul would
[1:20:24] write by inspiration of the Spirit of
[1:20:26] God God willing God willing desiring
[1:20:30] with the colours to show the Bible says
[1:20:32] to show the immutability of his counsel
[1:20:36] confirmed it with an oath I want you to
[1:20:39] catch this right here I'll tell you
[1:20:41] about how to spell the other day I was
[1:20:43] going through and going through that
[1:20:44] right there and my lord have mercy
[1:20:46] you know the sake of it the God look at
[1:20:49] this God didn't even have to do even
[1:20:51] utter another word what he has said he
[1:20:54] will perform but God wanted to show the
[1:20:59] immune ability of his counsel he
[1:21:02] confirmed what he said he swore by one
[1:21:06] there is nobody greater than himself
[1:21:09] he swore I will perform this so who is
[1:21:14] that it is God coming down the high
[1:21:17] priest I'm not canceling he came down
[1:21:20] and took upon a robe of flesh that's
[1:21:25] what the Bible could say that milk is
[1:21:27] acidic was made like unto the Son of God
[1:21:29] he was not the son of God he was made
[1:21:31] like unto the son of God but he had to
[1:21:34] become born of a woman why the Bible
[1:21:37] tells us in the book of Galatians that
[1:21:39] when we were we were shut up we were
[1:21:41] under bondage but he came in the
[1:21:44] fullness of time Jenna Galatians 4 he
[1:21:47] came in the fullness of time born of a
[1:21:49] woman that he might redeem them that
[1:21:51] were under the law is that right this is
[1:21:56] the coming it's a coming of the Lord
[1:21:59] moving in here verse 9 very bruised 9 24
[1:22:06] for Christ is not entered into the holy
[1:22:12] places made with hands
[1:22:15] Moses Tabernacle Moses made that off a
[1:22:19] pattern is that right Solomon he made
[1:22:24] that off the pattern that the Spirit had
[1:22:27] given to David and David communicated
[1:22:30] the pattern by the spirit under Solomon
[1:22:32] so here he's entered into heaven itself
[1:22:36] this is not a type this is the
[1:22:39] fulfillment of that now to appear in the
[1:22:43] presence of God for us what are we
[1:22:47] talking about I'm talking about the
[1:22:49] Advocate he's there because the Bible
[1:22:53] tells us in Revelations 12 it talks
[1:22:57] about how that Satan is the accuser of
[1:22:59] the Brethren hmm
[1:23:05] I'm not wanting to let all this fly this
[1:23:07] morning because I know it welcome but
[1:23:10] God has a way and has dismantled the
[1:23:16] accusations of the enemy in revelations
[1:23:24] chapter 5 he has no voice are you with
[1:23:28] me he hatched no voice he's given no
[1:23:31] audience revelations 5 he's given no
[1:23:36] audience what the lamb has come in full
[1:23:39] view full pardon has returned to the
[1:23:45] Church of the Living God you know what
[1:23:48] it says it don't mean that he ain't
[1:23:50] trying to accuse but what it shows
[1:23:53] you're not God is not there's not even a
[1:23:57] voice that can even reach the throne of
[1:23:59] God are you with me it shows you the
[1:24:04] reality of the place that you and I are
[1:24:07] at and that's necessary for translation
[1:24:11] faith we maybe have to sit on that one
[1:24:16] right there but to appear in the
[1:24:19] presence of God when that accuser right
[1:24:21] now the Bible says he's the accuser of
[1:24:22] the brother when he comes up and he
[1:24:24] wants to accuse
[1:24:26] here is one seated that is there as the
[1:24:32] price that's been paid and there is a
[1:24:36] connection inside of you that connects
[1:24:39] you with your sacrifice there remember
[1:24:44] you did not come to him he came to you
[1:24:46] and he said fear not the first watch
[1:24:51] fear not why fear will try to paralyze
[1:24:54] you fear will try to keep you back fear
[1:24:56] will tell you you're not worthy but he
[1:24:58] said fear not
[1:25:01] that's the first words he utters when he
[1:25:04] comes out on Resurrection morning when
[1:25:07] the rising of the Sun fear not and
[1:25:13] that's a saint listen to me now that's
[1:25:16] the same way this resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:25:19] Christ the Living God
[1:25:21] rat here among us brother why he's
[1:25:23] taking his word he is ministering to
[1:25:26] sons and daughters of God he's letting
[1:25:28] you know that it was not you seeking
[1:25:30] after him I sought you out you always
[1:25:33] belong to me and he draws us to him and
[1:25:36] gives us of his right what is that it's
[1:25:40] casting out here because you're looking
[1:25:45] at it well I don't know like in a little
[1:25:46] Christian life you know I've always
[1:25:48] tried this and every time I try I fail
[1:25:49] he comes and says fear not if you look
[1:25:53] at yourself
[1:25:54] you've got reason to fear cause that
[1:25:56] ain't nothing in you or me I don't care
[1:25:58] how good you are there is nothing good
[1:26:04] there is one good and that is God he
[1:26:09] came to us and said fear not well that
[1:26:13] tradition I tried that fear not I don't
[1:26:18] even feel like I'm preaching I feel like
[1:26:19] I'm making an announcement this morning
[1:26:23] hallelu cheering every hold and every
[1:26:27] devil of unbelief and speaking to sons
[1:26:30] and daughters of God and say it
[1:26:32] fear not it is your soul crying out it
[1:26:38] was the soul I believe when Legion where
[1:26:41] he was bound he cried out and Jesus
[1:26:45] crossed the sea because he heard the cry
[1:26:48] of one Jesus will take a service like
[1:26:55] this that here you know I don't know
[1:26:57] which way I'm gonna go and he'll
[1:26:59] directed why cause he's still the same
[1:27:01] Lord Jesus that will tell you fear not
[1:27:05] Oh hallelujah he's appearing in the
[1:27:14] presence of God for us let me just have
[1:27:21] just a little bit more time I didn't say
[1:27:24] how much a little bit was but I want a
[1:27:25] little bit nor yet that he should offer
[1:27:35] himself often he don't have to keep on
[1:27:40] offering himself over and over again
[1:27:41] that would speak of the lack of
[1:27:44] perfection as the high priest entered
[1:27:47] into the holy place every year with
[1:27:49] blood of others and I remember that high
[1:27:51] priest the Old Testament he would enter
[1:27:53] in once a year showing that it's one
[1:27:58] sufficient offering there is one
[1:28:01] offering there is one Passover one
[1:28:03] atonement amen for then must he often
[1:28:08] have suffered since the foundation of
[1:28:10] the world I tell you man you catching
[1:28:15] this
[1:28:15] Benny must have have suffered since the
[1:28:17] foundation of the world the fall listen
[1:28:21] the fall didn't catch God by surprise
[1:28:23] the Bible says in Revelation 13:8 the
[1:28:26] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:28:28] the
[1:28:30] already the remedy was given before
[1:28:35] there ever was a sin problem the answer
[1:28:39] and the remedy the antidote was already
[1:28:42] given
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:47] no wonder Paul could do a little praise
[1:28:50] because Romans late and he could talk
[1:28:53] about whoever that he had called he had
[1:28:56] predestinated he had called he had
[1:28:58] justified
[1:28:59] he had already glorified it's a finished
[1:29:02] work before the foundation of the world
[1:29:10] and names were wrote in the Lamb's Book
[1:29:13] of Life this was not the church broader
[1:29:16] this is God's mind the lines of God's
[1:29:21] mind what security what does it show
[1:29:29] this is the fulfillment what was in
[1:29:33] God's mind I'm had to preach a little
[1:29:39] more he satisfied the requirement he met
[1:29:44] what God had called for in his mind
[1:29:48] where the lamb was slain before the
[1:29:50] foundation of the world listen to me
[1:29:52] Isaiah 53 Isaiah was caught up out of
[1:29:58] his senses and Isaiah records it not in
[1:30:03] a future happening he was bruised past
[1:30:10] tense for our iniquities he was wounded
[1:30:15] for our transgressions by His stripes we
[1:30:20] were healed
[1:30:23] at Jesus was the manifestation of that
[1:30:28] perfect Lamb of God and when that was
[1:30:35] met then that same life God's all in the
[1:30:38] eyes
[1:30:39] now comes back to the worshiper to bring
[1:30:43] us into that perfection when we have
[1:30:47] been chosen before him in what's
[1:30:52] happened here the laundry tickets have
[1:30:55] come together
[1:30:57] what was once dirty laundry that has
[1:31:00] been a match that was made and instead
[1:31:06] of it being dirty laundry it releases
[1:31:08] the real cleansing we might need to play
[1:31:20] a song and then keep home hmm but now
[1:31:32] once let me read that first part again
[1:31:36] for then must he often have suffered
[1:31:39] since the foundation of the world but he
[1:31:41] is the perfect sacrifice but now once in
[1:31:46] the end of the world you said it went on
[1:31:49] for over 2,000 years but it's the end he
[1:31:54] said it is finished he's gathering his
[1:31:59] subjects under the finished atoning work
[1:32:03] of his own blood this is what Jesus
[1:32:12] ministered a time repent
[1:32:13] John repent for the kingdom of heaven is
[1:32:16] at hand right they weren't playing with
[1:32:20] words and hand it means now comes the
[1:32:23] visitation it can come on for years but
[1:32:25] here is the working of it
[1:32:29] he appeared to put away sin by the
[1:32:33] sacrifice of himself
[1:32:34] Oh my Hall Jesus Hebrews 12 24 and to
[1:32:47] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[1:32:51] not a pope not a pastor not a prophet
[1:32:58] but a prophet listen to me now I want to
[1:33:01] make this clear a prophet is the direct
[1:33:04] is a spokesman for Almighty God he is
[1:33:09] carrying a message from the throne of
[1:33:12] God revelations 1 vs. 4 vs. 5 and peace
[1:33:18] be unto you from Jesus Christ the Prince
[1:33:26] of the kings of the earth come on now
[1:33:29] and the seven stars that are in his
[1:33:33] right hand see it's a ministry of the
[1:33:36] finished work tying us back in to our
[1:33:40] inheritance the word comes as the
[1:33:44] trumpet to call us back to through the
[1:33:46] path of the word back into our
[1:33:48] inheritance and Jesus the mediator the
[1:33:52] one to go between oh lord thou has
[1:33:56] pleaded our cause he is the mediator one
[1:33:59] who has intervened Jesus is not the
[1:34:03] second person of the Godhead it is God
[1:34:08] become flesh
[1:34:11] for such a high priest became us no
[1:34:17] other man could do this nobody it was
[1:34:21] worthy Moses wasn't worthy
[1:34:24] it'll agile and were the great men of
[1:34:26] God but none of them were wising to do
[1:34:29] what God love could do hey man there had
[1:34:35] to come a blood that was not polluted
[1:34:39] they had to come one that would be able
[1:34:42] to separate us go glory be to God
[1:34:46] hallelujah and to Jesus the mediator of
[1:34:50] the New Covenant and to the blood of
[1:34:53] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[1:34:57] than that of a war remember Abel's blood
[1:35:02] Abel was righteous Abel listen to me now
[1:35:07] Oh glory even though Abel here he was he
[1:35:12] come through and by you know an act of
[1:35:15] Adam and Eve but listen to me now Abel
[1:35:18] the Bible said was righteous one made in
[1:35:23] righteous because the revelation that
[1:35:28] came to Abel directed him to the lamb
[1:35:34] and Abel came and brought a lamb and
[1:35:38] Abel offered life blood life that was in
[1:35:44] his stead he was not righteous because
[1:35:47] he was able but he the Bible said he
[1:35:51] obtained a witness that he was righteous
[1:35:56] when able begin to offer up that
[1:35:59] sacrifice brother joy the Holy Ghost
[1:36:02] came
[1:36:03] found upon that sacrifice in United evil
[1:36:07] with his sacrifice and God was not
[1:36:11] looking at Abel he was looking at the
[1:36:14] sacrifice the sacrifice was crying out
[1:36:20] righteous righteous righteous that's why
[1:36:27] the power of divine revelation the Holy
[1:36:30] Ghost comes upon that word and he it
[1:36:33] speaks hallelujah and when Abel King
[1:36:43] rose up he got jealous about that he
[1:36:46] smote Abel Abel's blood cried out and
[1:36:51] Abel's blood came right out and said
[1:36:53] Cain is guilty God said I'm here in his
[1:36:57] blood you see the blood of Abel could
[1:37:03] not do anything for King it could only
[1:37:06] condemn him it could only tell him he
[1:37:10] was wrong you see just the blood of a
[1:37:13] man who was born in sin he could only
[1:37:15] condemn right because it's condemned
[1:37:19] already but the blood of Jesus now we're
[1:37:25] talking something different now we're
[1:37:29] talking about the answer now we're
[1:37:31] talking about the remedy now we're
[1:37:34] talking about settling the sin question
[1:37:36] so much so that the Prophet could stand
[1:37:40] in the message token and he said your
[1:37:42] pain if you stood against this word he
[1:37:45] said if you haven't believed he sent me
[1:37:48] tell you the blood of Abel would condemn
[1:37:49] you he said that you old Cain the blood
[1:37:52] of Jesus Christ can take you and change
[1:37:55] you Wow because inside of Cain is Abel
[1:38:02] let me say it again inside a keg is Abel
[1:38:07] and when Abel receives the witness of
[1:38:11] life
[1:38:12] Abell expresses he's able are you with
[1:38:18] me
[1:38:18] it's an advocate that's expressing in
[1:38:21] our lives
[1:38:22] are you with me only the brother of
[1:38:25] Jesus can bring about a change and the
[1:38:30] other blood condemns but we have been
[1:38:32] brought back brought back by the blood
[1:38:34] of Jesus Christ back into the state of
[1:38:36] innocence II as much as brother Branham
[1:38:38] would stand there I believe it's in the
[1:38:40] message standing in the gap and here he
[1:38:41] could talk about dedicating a child he
[1:38:43] said do you realize he said like this
[1:38:45] first he said that when you had been
[1:38:46] born of the Spirit of God and brought
[1:38:48] under the blood of Jesus Christ he said
[1:38:50] you're his innocent he said no let me
[1:38:51] correct that he said you are more
[1:38:53] innocent than a baby
[1:38:58] why because we're looking at the blood I
[1:39:03] said we're looking at the blood that's
[1:39:08] why when Jesus you know here this would
[1:39:10] be known in the Old Testament and it
[1:39:12] would be known in the Old Testament or
[1:39:14] Worthen but they would say well he
[1:39:15] whoever is born as a bastard child they
[1:39:17] cannot enter the congregation onto 400
[1:39:19] years is that right
[1:39:21] they couldn't even come in that way
[1:39:22] because you see there wasn't a blood
[1:39:24] strong enough you know I'm quoting there
[1:39:26] was not a blood strong enough that could
[1:39:28] take care of that sin
[1:39:29] what was that showing that was a type to
[1:39:32] show that no animal blood it was all for
[1:39:35] nomads house it was required to be
[1:39:36] perfect it was required to be spotless
[1:39:38] but there is no bad that could bring us
[1:39:41] in to the sanctuary of God there was
[1:39:44] only one blood that could actually bring
[1:39:46] you back into the sanctuary of God back
[1:39:49] into the house of God back into what we
[1:39:52] are sons and daughters of God he will
[1:39:54] take the blood of Jesus Christ you might
[1:40:00] have been born a bastard child but there
[1:40:02] can be things all the way down your
[1:40:03] family and in your family tree but let
[1:40:06] me just tell you something you can take
[1:40:08] every single thing and you can tie it
[1:40:11] all up and wrap it all up and the blood
[1:40:14] of Jesus Christ has already
[1:40:17] town for it the blood of Jesus speaketh
[1:40:27] better things
[1:40:36] glory let me just have just a few more
[1:40:42] moments right don't you say already said
[1:40:52] that you're grinning like a possum these
[1:40:57] lemons let's get to this point here
[1:40:59] because this is very very very important
[1:41:01] and even as we are looking more into
[1:41:03] this the advocate of the believer and
[1:41:04] we'll go into this Lord willing next
[1:41:06] week when it came time for them to leave
[1:41:09] Egypt God let him know in Exodus 12 that
[1:41:14] this is going to be the beginning of
[1:41:16] months for you this is going to be a new
[1:41:21] beginning well who's the one that
[1:41:24] determines a new beginning him he's the
[1:41:30] one that determines the new beginning
[1:41:33] not talking about turning over a new
[1:41:34] leaf he's the one that brings a new
[1:41:38] creation he's the one that brings new
[1:41:41] birth he's the one that brings new life
[1:41:47] hallelujah he let him know this gonna be
[1:41:49] a new beginning
[1:41:52] and what did he tell him to do he said
[1:41:55] take a lamb
[1:41:56] and I want you to slay this win and I
[1:42:00] want you to take the blood and I want
[1:42:04] you to smite this to side post and I
[1:42:09] want you to smite that over-the-door you
[1:42:14] see his ad he let it be known I don't
[1:42:17] want you don't put it on the threshold
[1:42:19] because we're not to trample the blood
[1:42:21] of Jesus
[1:42:21] you don't walk on this blood you come
[1:42:25] under his blood you come free his blood
[1:42:31] you're not walking off for his blood
[1:42:33] brother William we walked through his
[1:42:35] blood brother just wait when they went
[1:42:38] through the Red Sea guess what the side
[1:42:41] post was right there they were walking
[1:42:44] through the side post and guess what he
[1:42:47] was over Egypt they had to walk out the
[1:43:01] door under the blood they didn't roll
[1:43:05] out a window that be a thief and a
[1:43:08] robber had to come through the door
[1:43:12] coming under the leadership of the Holy
[1:43:15] Spirit the Shepherd is the dog and my
[1:43:18] sheep hear my voice I know them by me
[1:43:30] her new you hallelujah glory and God
[1:43:35] said I'm gonna pass through Egypt this
[1:43:37] night I'm gonna smite all the firstborn
[1:43:40] I'm gonna execute judgment upon the
[1:43:43] highest of highs I'm gonna execute I'm
[1:43:46] gonna execute judgment on every one of
[1:43:48] their gods their gods at all of Egypt
[1:43:52] has been resting in and hoping in and
[1:43:54] trusting in I'm gonna execute judgement
[1:43:57] my wrath is gonna be poured out but
[1:44:01] here's the mercy of God aren't you glad
[1:44:04] for God's mercy
[1:44:06] you see that many way I'm not gonna
[1:44:08] preach at the mercy of God so many times
[1:44:11] how in situations that look so bleak and
[1:44:14] the mercy of God stepped right in it was
[1:44:17] a mercy of God that they were not
[1:44:20] consumed but you see God will never
[1:44:23] consume the righteous with the
[1:44:26] unrighteous you say they were not even
[1:44:29] under the blood yet but God was looking
[1:44:32] from his word when he sent His Prophet
[1:44:35] with the word he already know who would
[1:44:39] come under the blood he sent that
[1:44:41] message for them thy seed shall sojourn
[1:44:47] for 400 years
[1:44:50] God don't forget one of his promises you
[1:44:54] hear me
[1:44:55] I said God don't forget one of his
[1:44:57] promises we might get weary enough but
[1:45:00] doc don't forgive one of his promises
[1:45:03] but saying I did practice on praying
[1:45:08] hallelujah - let him renew and
[1:45:10] strengthen your faith this is what he
[1:45:12] said he said when I see the Blood I will
[1:45:16] pass over you the blood being under the
[1:45:24] blood was a representation that death
[1:45:29] has already come to this house one has
[1:45:35] died for all who are in in it one has
[1:45:39] died blood was there now watch this the
[1:45:43] focus and I the focus and I want you to
[1:45:47] get this the focus is upon the sacrifice
[1:45:55] the innocent lamb - the blood - the life
[1:46:01] on the lam the innocency of the lamb
[1:46:04] right
[1:46:05] God didn't habitants listen to me God
[1:46:08] did not have them inspect that lamb
[1:46:12] wondering if they would find fault are
[1:46:15] you hearing me he was not having them
[1:46:17] inspect that lamb just so that they
[1:46:20] would become knowledgeable what he
[1:46:22] wanted to do he wanted them to see how
[1:46:25] he was going to see dead that's why he
[1:46:32] said I want you to examine this lamb I
[1:46:35] want you to see every spot of it I want
[1:46:39] you to look at everywhere to let that
[1:46:41] deaf who could ever come and try to
[1:46:43] present something there's a spot here or
[1:46:46] a spot there you can say your it has
[1:46:49] been examined it has been what what what
[1:47:01] has made it accepted the word the word
[1:47:04] has said it has met the requirements and
[1:47:12] if he has met the requirements and has
[1:47:18] coming you then you are right we
[1:47:29] advocate I said we have an advocate with
[1:47:34] the father Jesus Christ the righteous
[1:47:40] must an
[1:47:47] this is the true focus the focus it goes
[1:47:55] from the lam remember it's all tied
[1:47:58] together to the blood that was offered
[1:48:01] to the life of that blood because the
[1:48:09] Lamb of God already went to Calvary and
[1:48:14] they just tell you if you're a sinner
[1:48:16] this morning maybe even one that will
[1:48:18] hear this message there's already been
[1:48:20] in lamb that's went for you he already
[1:48:27] paid the price
[1:48:28] he already I find no fault in him there
[1:48:30] was testimony from all he did what was
[1:48:35] necessary he shed his blood and he paid
[1:48:40] the penalty is that right he pleaded our
[1:48:44] case he went in he said touch me not for
[1:48:46] I have not yet ascended he went there
[1:48:47] and here it was the presentation and
[1:48:49] then as he came back down and gave
[1:48:52] instruction for them that they as the
[1:48:55] believing children that they would come
[1:48:57] under the blood of the Lamb that was
[1:49:01] shed they would come under that blood as
[1:49:04] you sing about it this morning on the
[1:49:06] day of Pentecost wherein moved listen to
[1:49:10] me now it wasn't just looking at Calvary
[1:49:13] anymore it wasn't just talking about the
[1:49:16] blood that spilled on the ground but now
[1:49:19] it moves to the life that was within
[1:49:22] that blood coming back in the worshiper
[1:49:26] the Holy Ghost and what does he do he
[1:49:30] calls us to that perfection he brings us
[1:49:36] to that righteousness amen let's just
[1:49:40] bow our heads this morning
[1:49:46] is there anyone that would want to be
[1:49:47] remembered in prayer this morning God
[1:49:50] knows your need this morning he knows he
[1:49:54] knows your need whether it's sickness
[1:49:56] whether it's for healing whether it's
[1:49:58] deliverance maybe it's to come into that
[1:50:00] place to say I want to come under the
[1:50:02] blood fully he knows where you're at and
[1:50:06] God his faith we've examined we've
[1:50:10] looked at the lamb it's been examined
[1:50:12] it's been thoroughly proved the blood
[1:50:14] the life that same life that was within
[1:50:17] that lamb the same Almighty God our high
[1:50:19] priest has moved up and down the aisles
[1:50:22] this morning speaking to our hearts I'll
[1:50:26] say it to you right now
[1:50:28] don't go out of here this morning the
[1:50:31] same way you came in you just you call
[1:50:34] that devil a liar that's what he is
[1:50:38] because there's already a blood that has
[1:50:41] spoken for you you don't have to carry
[1:50:45] nothing you don't have to go out of here
[1:50:47] bound you don't have to go out of here
[1:50:49] this morning sick in your body you don't
[1:50:52] have to go out of here tormented in your
[1:50:53] mind you don't have to go out of here
[1:50:55] bound by sin because he is here not
[1:51:00] because her brother Sam I could lay my
[1:51:02] hands upon you but my hands can't do
[1:51:04] nothing for you but Jesus has already
