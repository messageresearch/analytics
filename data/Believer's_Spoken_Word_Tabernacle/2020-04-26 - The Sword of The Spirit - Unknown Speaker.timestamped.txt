[32:27] to us ask the Father anything in my name
[32:30] and it shall be done that you would
[32:34] desire that we would come and present
[32:37] our lives before you Lord I think in the
[32:43] time of Israel there were three times a
[32:47] year that their males were to come and
[32:50] present themselves before the Lord we
[32:54] see that outworking Lord in the
[32:56] administration Oh God son of man son of
[33:01] God son of David we see that
[33:03] administration Lord we are it's never
[33:06] Lord left to wear that we are not to
[33:10] come and present ourselves but we're
[33:11] here to present ourselves before you
[33:15] Lord we're asking this morning that you
[33:19] would come you administer to our lives
[33:23] you would take that Lord of the fruit
[33:25] that you have brought forth in our lives
[33:28] and old God may we just Lord as feasting
[33:32] with you and may you just speak to our
[33:34] hearts Lord in such a personal way Lord
[33:38] we go we have a need of you this morning
[33:40] that you'll come you would be the
[33:42] speaker Lord let me help me to get out
[33:45] of the way help your children Lord help
[33:48] them to get out of the way the needs
[33:50] that they have Lord they just place them
[33:54] on the altar Lord God just laying and
[33:58] having just one expectation and that is
[34:00] for you to come Lord I'm not trying to
[34:04] figure out how it's going to be just
[34:06] it's who it that's who will come and do
[34:09] it and that's you so Lord we just ask
[34:12] that you'll take control now minister to
[34:14] every need we pray for your glory we ask
[34:18] these things in the name of Jesus Christ
[34:21] amen amen
[34:25] let's look right into the word here this
[34:27] morning we want to go right into the
[34:30] scriptures and I'm just going to read a
[34:31] few verses of scriptures from Ephesians
[34:34] 6 and then we will allow you to have
[34:40] your seat in Ephesians 6 verse 10 we've
[34:44] been moving through this for some for
[34:46] some time here finally my brethren
[34:50] here's the admonition the Spirit of God
[34:52] through Paul finally my brethren be
[34:55] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[34:58] his might put on the whole armour of God
[35:02] that you may be able to stand against
[35:06] the wiles of the devil for we wrestle
[35:10] not against flesh and blood but against
[35:13] principalities against powers against
[35:17] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[35:19] against spiritual wickedness in high
[35:22] places
[35:25] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[35:29] of God that you may be able to withstand
[35:32] in the evil day and having done all to
[35:37] stand
[35:39] so Paul has made very clear that though
[35:47] that we here are walking in this life
[35:51] but our warfare is not a flesh and blood
[35:55] affair it's to recognize that there is
[36:00] spiritual powers demons evil spirits
[36:05] that we are fighting against and Paul
[36:09] has mentioned and let it be very clear
[36:12] that this we are wrestling and against
[36:16] principalities power these are fallen
[36:20] angels those that that fail to keep
[36:24] their first estate and here these
[36:27] angelic battles fell on humans and
[36:31] become human battles then how that we
[36:35] need the discernment and the wisdom of
[36:37] the Holy Spirit that we don't try to
[36:40] approach a spiritual battle with flesh
[36:43] and blood affair because we're always
[36:46] lose and that's what Satan listen Satan
[36:52] knows if he can draw us out into flesh
[36:55] and blood he's already got a swift he's
[36:58] already got us whipped this is where
[37:00] that we need the discernment of the
[37:03] Spirit of God not just to discern that
[37:06] of the opposition but also to discern
[37:10] where we are at presently even in our
[37:13] heart our mind our attitude we want to
[37:17] stay behind the word in all things
[37:20] so then Paul goes through the different
[37:24] parts of the armor now remember when the
[37:28] armor itself is the full word of God
[37:31] which is the life of God the Holy Spirit
[37:35] the seal of God all of these parts come
[37:39] all together
[37:41] you don't gain one part and then you
[37:44] gain another part no it all comes
[37:46] together the things that just like in a
[37:49] natural army Navy
[37:50] so for Marines and on and on you gain
[37:53] rewards that go on your armament and
[37:57] there are rewards that will when we come
[38:00] to the other side it's not just the
[38:02] reward of the crown of life of a new
[38:04] body but there will be rewards that are
[38:06] handed out for how that the lives have
[38:10] been yielded to him here we're not
[38:12] living for any certain to have a great
[38:16] accolade of rewards over there we simply
[38:18] want to be there we want to see him and
[38:20] so the rewards at that time what a
[38:24] glorious time that it will be so to see
[38:28] that within this all these parts of the
[38:30] armor when we get to looking at this and
[38:33] we've come through that of all all of
[38:36] these down through verse 17 and that's
[38:38] where I want to go to you find that each
[38:41] one of these clear down through the
[38:44] middle part of 17 are all defensive
[38:47] we've got there is there the word is
[38:50] given there is a defensive part within
[38:53] the word because we're going to come
[38:55] into battle we're going to fight there's
[38:58] fights going on and you've got to have
[38:59] our lives have got to be covered in this
[39:02] battle but remember if we had all of the
[39:05] armament and we had all of these other
[39:08] pieces to defend and we did not have an
[39:10] offensive part within it then we would
[39:13] surely be defeated but God gave see the
[39:17] balance of the word is that of defensive
[39:19] and that of offensive and God would
[39:23] place that even as Israel was coming in
[39:25] to the promised land which Ephesians
[39:27] types that of the promised land now
[39:28] notice let's draw here in verse 17 and
[39:31] take the helmet of salvation and the
[39:34] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[39:40] God
[39:43] so may God bless you bless the word as
[39:46] you're being seated I want to just just
[39:49] to take something from here there is
[39:51] many parts and we just see how the Lord
[39:54] would lead us truly many of the
[39:57] inspiration of things just over the
[39:59] months and things of just kind of as the
[40:02] Lord just dropping things I certainly
[40:05] was not looking maybe in this direction
[40:08] but how that God would help us to see
[40:11] that within our our armament when we are
[40:15] to use the sword of the Spirit that how
[40:18] that in reality that is where we are
[40:21] depending upon the leadership of the
[40:24] Holy Spirit we are not to just venture
[40:28] out in our imagination but it is to take
[40:31] God's Word and to stand upon that word
[40:34] and God will inspire his word to our
[40:37] hearts there are things and promises and
[40:40] what we need that we need the
[40:42] inspiration of the Holy Spirit and so
[40:45] this sword of the Spirit which is the
[40:48] word of God when we begin to look at
[40:51] this this is a statement that brother
[40:54] Branham made within that of of the
[40:57] message and you know when we think of
[41:00] this sword it was a sword that was not
[41:03] something really long when Paul was
[41:05] writing this by inspiration this sword
[41:08] that he's referring to is that sword
[41:10] that he would see on the soldier that he
[41:13] was chained to you see Paul and brother
[41:16] bran would tell us Paul would write of
[41:17] these things even of the races you know
[41:19] the Olympic races and he would liken it
[41:22] to that of a life that's running he
[41:24] would be able to catch inspiration from
[41:27] that and it being applied to the kingdom
[41:29] of God will this sword that would be the
[41:32] accompanied on the on that of the the
[41:36] Roman soldier it was that of not a real
[41:38] long sword it was reduced down to 24
[41:42] inches and it was what there's known as
[41:44] called a a gladium it was a short sword
[41:47] and the only way that that soldier could
[41:51] actually come into carrying that gladium
[41:54] is when he came into
[41:56] manhood he was a young man he came into
[41:59] maturity and when the sword of the
[42:02] Spirit was given to him ittan was it
[42:04] that sword itself was signification he
[42:08] has full citizenship so he was he was
[42:13] there in representation of that of Rome
[42:17] full citizenship he was there to see and
[42:20] not only he was armed a benefactor of
[42:24] the of all that Rome was but he also was
[42:28] a defender of those freedoms and that
[42:31] Liberty and I believe that's exactly
[42:34] that what the reality that is to strike
[42:36] the heart of a believer is we recognize
[42:39] when we can see and realize the Liberty
[42:43] that has come to us it is that Liberty
[42:47] of which the Spirit of God would right
[42:49] through Jude let us earnestly contend
[42:51] for the faith the Liberty the Spirit of
[42:56] God that word of God which was delivered
[42:59] to the Saints because Satan is out there
[43:02] to try to take away if he can that word
[43:05] because remember there is no Liberty
[43:08] outside of the word of God Satan
[43:11] promises and wants to say well this and
[43:14] that if you didn't have this you know if
[43:17] it wasn't for the word of God if it won
[43:18] from that but once a person comes to a
[43:20] place of overcoming and they recognize
[43:23] the Liberty that's been tugging on their
[43:25] heart dealing with their life telling
[43:27] them you can be free I have set you free
[43:29] accept that Liberty once they finally
[43:32] lay down and they allow Liberty to move
[43:36] into their heart then the Word of God is
[43:38] no longer Grievous it's no longer in
[43:41] opposition
[43:42] they then and now have the same one who
[43:44] has brought Liberty living inside of
[43:47] their life and then it is Christ working
[43:49] in them and when it comes face-to-face
[43:51] with the word they realize that God is
[43:54] on my side and so that this is where as
[43:57] a believer we are to walk and I want to
[44:00] take from this thought because when we
[44:04] look at the Word of God the sword of the
[44:08] Spirit meaning
[44:09] the Word of God and I don't want to deal
[44:11] so much with that of the word that is
[44:13] wrote there the Word of God in terms of
[44:17] Rhema and logos in this case it is the
[44:20] Rhema which is that which is spoken by
[44:22] living voice that which is soul made
[44:24] personal by the Spirit of God but within
[44:27] that it will take as brother Branham
[44:29] would write to us in greatest battle
[44:31] ever fought he said we are to take the
[44:33] sword which is the word of God and pull
[44:36] it with what a hand of faith a strong
[44:41] hand of faith the two-edged sword
[44:44] now notice Hebrews 4 it's a two-edged
[44:48] sword it cuts both coming and going
[44:53] it's a loosening now when we think of
[44:57] this here there was a need for in
[45:01] Redemption there was a need for man to
[45:05] be set free when the Lord Jesus himself
[45:07] when he came remember the religious of
[45:10] that day they who had the promises of
[45:13] the prophets the Psalms all of the
[45:15] Messianic promises they had and when he
[45:19] came he came where it was not according
[45:22] to their thinking they were looking at
[45:25] that there was a need to a stir the rule
[45:28] of Rome from that of you know from that
[45:32] of Israel to remove that ruling part but
[45:34] what they didn't recognize that that in
[45:37] itself there was a greater rule that
[45:40] once that rule was taken care of the
[45:43] rest of it will also fade and that is he
[45:47] came not to remove that of the physical
[45:50] Empire but he came to do away and dude
[45:53] battle with that of the spiritual Empire
[45:55] because remember that where it is to
[45:58] begin with in the heart of an individual
[46:01] and then it leads even to the outside
[46:03] what God has done and he brings forth in
[46:07] in our life it needs to that place to
[46:10] that of the Millennium where eventually
[46:12] there Satan is bound with the chain of
[46:15] circumstance and then over into the
[46:17] future home so there must come that's
[46:20] that that is the qualification
[46:23] and the need in order for for us to to
[46:27] be able to move even into that place it
[46:29] was a need to dwell or to deal with what
[46:33] was present in our life and so when we
[46:36] find this I want to just if I can your
[46:39] heart would just move in this direction
[46:41] we want to look so much not just looking
[46:45] at the armor not just looking at the
[46:47] sword of the Spirit the Word of God
[46:49] which we should have a heart that says
[46:52] every word of God is yay and amen but we
[46:55] want to look at the operating power
[46:58] behind this word and so to look at the
[47:02] operating power behind this word we want
[47:05] to look at how then even in that day
[47:07] they missed what was going on and hear
[47:11] God yet was coming according to his
[47:13] promise word and here he gave them there
[47:17] a baby in a manger the scripture said
[47:21] behold a virgin shall conceive and we
[47:23] find that in John 3:14 the scripture
[47:27] says as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[47:30] the wilderness even so must the Son of
[47:33] Man be lifted up
[47:35] see we were snake-bitten we have been
[47:39] bitten by that first birth we need a
[47:42] deliverance that first birth is a
[47:45] rebellion against God's Word is that
[47:48] right that whosoever believeth in him
[47:51] very important words believeth in him
[47:55] should not perish but have eternal life
[47:58] for God so loved the world now I want
[48:02] you to think it was not that God loved
[48:05] the sin and the framework of the world
[48:08] but God's love was for that of fallen
[48:13] humanity
[48:15] he's coming to redeem to redeem means to
[48:20] restore to bring back for God so loved
[48:24] the world that He gave His only begotten
[48:27] Son but whosoever believeth in him
[48:30] should not perish but have everlasting
[48:33] life for God sent not his son into the
[48:38] world to condemn the world but that the
[48:40] world through him might be saved he that
[48:44] believeth on him is not condemned you
[48:47] realize nobody has to go to hell this
[48:52] said whosoever believeth on him
[48:55] a person may only be able to see to a
[48:58] certain degree you don't have nobody has
[49:00] to go to hell if a person it makes up
[49:02] their mind and their heart and said you
[49:04] know what I wanna I want to live for God
[49:06] I want it forsake the world nobody has
[49:09] to go to hell
[49:10] but he that believeth not is condemned
[49:14] already because he had not believed in
[49:18] the name of the only begotten Son of God
[49:21] Jesus look at look here in John 10:10
[49:24] we're speaking of as the chief Shepherd
[49:26] the thief cometh not but for to steal
[49:29] and to kill and to destroy
[49:31] I am come that they might have life and
[49:35] that they might have it more abundantly
[49:38] as the father knoweth me even so know I
[49:42] the father and I lay down my life for
[49:45] the Sheep and other sheep have I which
[49:49] are not of this fold them also I must
[49:52] bring and they shall hear my voice who's
[49:57] he talking about we are products of this
[50:00] we were of we were his sheep of the
[50:03] Gentiles but remember what he said when
[50:06] I'm here I am not sent but to the lost
[50:08] sheep of Israel there had to come a
[50:11] final turning and a rejection to where
[50:14] the gospel would go to the Jews we see
[50:17] or to the Gentiles which would come Paul
[50:19] would identify that was the ministry
[50:22] that God had committed unto him the
[50:24] mystery which which was hid from before
[50:28] the foundation of the world that of God
[50:29] taking out a people for his namesake
[50:32] so that we're we were always sheep of
[50:36] God and Durell as his life was laid down
[50:38] for us we weren't even aware of it as
[50:42] Gentiles but he wouldn't matter who
[50:44] we're aware of it or not he did it
[50:46] because he foreknew you and me it was
[50:51] only an acting out of what already took
[50:53] place in the mind of God
[50:55] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[50:57] of the world this was God's heart
[51:00] Christ is the very heart and expression
[51:03] of God them all so I must bring how will
[51:07] I bring them by my voice
[51:09] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[51:10] the spirit saith to the church it is the
[51:13] Word of God that brings life and
[51:16] authority power deliverance salvation
[51:20] Redemption it is in the word and when
[51:24] the word is preached there is a living
[51:26] God going forth among the people of God
[51:29] it is Liberty that is being proclaimed
[51:35] Torah be to God and there shall be one
[51:39] fold and one Shepherd
[51:41] oh my Romans 5:6 for when we were yet
[51:46] without strength in due time Christ died
[51:51] for the ungodly once you think of these
[51:54] words now for scarcely for a righteous
[51:58] man will one die yet peradventure for a
[52:01] good man some would even dare to die but
[52:05] God commendeth his love toward us in
[52:09] that while we were yet sinners Christ
[52:14] died for us much more then being now
[52:19] justified by his blood we shall be saved
[52:22] from wrath through him for if when we
[52:27] were enemies o my enemies and I'm in our
[52:31] mind in our soul in our nature for if
[52:34] when we were enemies we were reconciled
[52:37] to God by the death of his son much more
[52:41] being reconciled we shall be saved by
[52:45] his life so remember here the
[52:51] reconciling God was in Christ
[52:53] reconciling the world unto himself here
[52:58] is all unfolding through the life of the
[53:00] Lord Jesus and then as he as he hung
[53:03] there on the cross suspended between the
[53:05] heavens and earth remember here he is
[53:08] now paying the price and has then from
[53:12] the vivir death and then the burial and
[53:15] the resurrection then he ascends back up
[53:19] on high and
[53:21] that same spirit that same life which
[53:25] was to do what it is to reconcile bring
[53:29] to a real harmony in the heart of an
[53:32] individual a man that's real harmony
[53:35] harmony isn't just a group of people
[53:38] being together but harmony is where our
[53:41] spirits and our hearts our lives are
[53:44] knitted together in one purpose one mind
[53:48] and one accord and so here his life
[53:51] comes to reconcile us fully to the word
[53:55] in other words so that there is not a
[53:57] breach between us and the word but when
[54:01] the Holy Spirit in our life it yokes us
[54:04] to the word and there is a change that
[54:07] has come about in our life this is a
[54:09] reality of reconciliation and so
[54:13] remember God has given to you and I that
[54:16] word of reconciliation a word that is
[54:19] that the Spirit of God carries to the
[54:22] heart of an individual and not just says
[54:25] you can be free but lets them know you
[54:28] are free quit walking the same line like
[54:31] Johnny crow you are free what must I do
[54:34] act upon the Word of God just simply
[54:38] receive it Oh God has brought it down
[54:42] for our hearts and lives to be able to
[54:45] accept it and Paul said and not only so
[54:48] but we also joy in God through our Lord
[54:52] Jesus Christ by whom we have now
[54:55] received the atonement we've received
[55:00] the atonement he is the atonement we've
[55:02] received the atonement because it is the
[55:04] life remember when they were smoked the
[55:07] sacrifice God let him know in the Book
[55:10] of Leviticus and numbers and in there in
[55:12] even in Deuteronomy when you when you
[55:15] offer the offering let no man eat of the
[55:18] blood but let the blood be poured out
[55:20] because in the blood is the life and the
[55:22] life is the atonement and that's why in
[55:25] this hour
[55:26] if the blood itself is not enough you
[55:28] must have the life that was within that
[55:31] blood and that is the token that
[55:33] is the atonement and the word atonement
[55:36] at1 meant those who were - yeah they
[55:39] shall be one it is atonement at one mint
[55:45] are you listening now
[55:47] it took van of the laying down of the
[55:49] life that he heather life might come and
[55:51] join us together now think of this here
[55:55] the word the word became flesh and dwelt
[55:59] among us but the word and unnoticed he
[56:01] was always the word but notice has he
[56:04] descends he becomes or he takes on his
[56:07] own word he comes in the form of his
[56:10] word is that right
[56:12] now he not only become the word but he
[56:15] become the high priest of his own word
[56:19] amen he's not only the word but he is
[56:22] the high priest of his own word I want
[56:25] you to think of this for a moment we're
[56:27] talking about the weapons that we're
[56:31] using and this is one of the first ones
[56:33] we would deal with is that that of the
[56:35] sword the sword is not a defensive and
[56:38] not a defensive weapon a sword is an
[56:41] offensive weapon is that right god don't
[56:45] want his children running from the devil
[56:47] we need the armor when we're in close
[56:50] combat you understand this sword oh my
[56:53] this sword is not is not ten foot long
[56:56] no you're going to meet the devil
[56:58] face-to-face this sword was twenty four
[57:00] inches
[57:01] you've got to be able to thrust it in
[57:03] him or if the prophet said trained for
[57:06] the knock out punch 'as but just like
[57:10] boxers that we would know of many times
[57:13] when they get knocked out what do they
[57:15] say I want a rematch and the devil you
[57:18] can knock him out and tomorrow he said I
[57:20] want a rematch
[57:21] you knock him out the next day next day
[57:24] I want a rematch he need not very never
[57:26] gives up he keeps coming he did the same
[57:28] thing to the Lord Jesus
[57:30] now the think of this here he become he
[57:34] himself he brought the weapon down for
[57:36] you and I but it was not a weapon how
[57:39] that man would think about it remember
[57:41] that there are the Jews and different
[57:43] ones they had the word but
[57:44] they were absent of was the real weapon
[57:47] yet you would say well they had the word
[57:49] but yet they were absent of the real
[57:52] governing power that was needed to
[57:55] actually bring and utilize that word and
[57:58] bring deliverance now we've seen
[58:00] glimpses of it that'll come right down
[58:02] through different ones that's live down
[58:04] through the Old Testament but here
[58:06] looking at the Lord Jesus brother
[58:08] branham brings us and says it like this
[58:10] he says now that's the material that the
[58:13] church has got what a weapon there was
[58:15] never been one like it he was the word
[58:18] and when he come he was born in a manger
[58:21] he come to use the weapon of l.o.v.e
[58:24] love to conquer the world not with army
[58:28] bullets not with machine guns and tanks
[58:30] but he come in a different manner he
[58:32] come in the form of love he was God's
[58:35] love oh my that's totally contrary to
[58:38] the framework of this world it's
[58:41] contrary because the way that this world
[58:43] is that whoever is ruling is the one who
[58:47] actually has more firepower or who has
[58:50] greater power but you see that's not the
[58:52] kingdom of God so in order to operate
[58:55] within the kingdom of God and that our
[58:57] armor would function the right way we
[59:00] have got to know and understand and be
[59:02] yielded to the operating force that
[59:05] actually brings about a strong hand of
[59:07] faith now you would look at it let me
[59:09] just kind of move ahead and then just
[59:11] drop back into this you might ask
[59:13] yourself the question what does love
[59:14] have to do with the strong hand of faith
[59:16] I want you to understand the Bible says
[59:19] that faith worketh by love it is by love
[59:24] that faith works and it operates and so
[59:27] within this in order to have that of
[59:30] faith that will actually be operative
[59:32] and stand on God's Word there has to be
[59:35] that of a real governing power of love
[59:38] that's behind it think of this in his
[59:40] life what was showed to you and I as
[59:43] much as Paul can look at this Roman
[59:45] soldier with the sword on his side so
[59:47] can you and I take the glimpse of this
[59:50] great warrior remember in the book of
[59:52] Isaiah Isaiah 59 when he came the Bible
[59:56] says he would
[59:57] with righteousness as a breastplate and
[1:00:00] he would come with that of salvation as
[1:00:04] a helmet you say it doesn't mention
[1:00:06] anything about the word but he was the
[1:00:09] word you see the word he became flesh
[1:00:12] and dwelt among us and he play he
[1:00:15] brought the word back to a place that
[1:00:17] the word itself could be so seated in
[1:00:20] the heart and soul of man that the word
[1:00:23] could actually move from that and the
[1:00:26] sword would be that which would go forth
[1:00:28] through the mouths of his children
[1:00:31] because after all in the beginning it
[1:00:33] was by the spoken word and the spoken
[1:00:36] word is the original life so he must be
[1:00:38] able to restore and get the word back to
[1:00:41] its original place not that of the mind
[1:00:43] although we need to have the helmet of
[1:00:45] salvation but the word in order for it
[1:00:48] to be operative it must be seated in our
[1:00:51] heart by divine love so notice when
[1:00:54] Jesus would come he would come in a
[1:00:57] manner they would call him a fanatic
[1:00:58] they would call him Beelzebub yet you
[1:01:01] find you know as a Bible reader you do
[1:01:03] not find Jesus standing around trying to
[1:01:05] debate with them trying to prove his
[1:01:07] point trying to do this if there was
[1:01:08] leadership that was given that would
[1:01:10] cause him to say consider this consider
[1:01:13] that consider this but remiel eyes that
[1:01:15] hidden there was many that just rejected
[1:01:17] him even of the religious of that day
[1:01:20] but Jesus would go what's this what's
[1:01:22] how that this of love would be made
[1:01:24] manifest he would go to the lowest city
[1:01:26] on earth called Jericho and in the
[1:01:29] lowest city in Jericho the shortest man
[1:01:32] in that city named Zacchaeus would
[1:01:34] actually have to crawl up a tree to be
[1:01:37] able to see him you see it shows how God
[1:01:40] made himself so low for you and I what
[1:01:43] was that such humility there was nothing
[1:01:46] like that that was upon the earth at
[1:01:48] that time remember that of the world is
[1:01:51] about stepping on one another and
[1:01:53] edifying self that is characteristics of
[1:01:56] the world but here the very heart and
[1:01:58] love of God it came down to so low to
[1:02:01] the shortest man on the earth had to get
[1:02:03] on a tree and look down to even seen OMA
[1:02:06] now to think of that with the weapon
[1:02:08] brother Graham would go on to say it
[1:02:10] again with
[1:02:10] weapon of love he conquered every devil
[1:02:14] with what the weapon of love
[1:02:17] he conquered every devil oh my now think
[1:02:21] about what the what Satan had actually
[1:02:24] done in the very beginning from even
[1:02:27] when he led the rebellion there in
[1:02:30] heaven he led them away from their first
[1:02:32] estate is that of the love of God
[1:02:35] remember we see the identification of
[1:02:37] them spirits working there underneath
[1:02:39] that administration of a white horse
[1:02:41] rider where it would actually draw away
[1:02:43] the people in the Ephesian age that
[1:02:45] spirit would be identified the
[1:02:47] Antichrist spirits already working it
[1:02:49] was right there working amongst the
[1:02:51] people in that hour what was it to do
[1:02:53] lead him away from the love of God then
[1:02:56] the men remember many of the people did
[1:02:58] not for say forsake the letter of the
[1:03:01] word but they first sucked the life of
[1:03:03] the word and if Satan can bring a
[1:03:05] substitution in that of a removal from
[1:03:08] the word I don't care how much a person
[1:03:10] has a Bible he's got him whipped because
[1:03:13] remember it is not our strength or our
[1:03:15] mind that is to operate the word it is
[1:03:18] to be the Spirit of God the love of God
[1:03:20] seated in our heart that actually
[1:03:23] operates the Word of God in our life now
[1:03:26] when we think of this here remember in
[1:03:28] the beginning when the fall had come
[1:03:30] about when the fall came about
[1:03:32] remember we see how there begin to be a
[1:03:34] blame immediately immediately when when
[1:03:37] situations came and here God comes down
[1:03:39] and immediately when the Prince of God
[1:03:41] comes down among them the first thing
[1:03:43] that you find is when he addresses Adam
[1:03:46] why Adam is the head he's the husband
[1:03:48] he's responsible for what is going on in
[1:03:50] his home and so the love of God noticed
[1:03:53] the love of God he doesn't come out
[1:03:54] accusatory the love the love of God
[1:03:56] comes down and begins to ask Adam or
[1:04:00] what what you know what what have you
[1:04:02] done it begins to ask him you know you
[1:04:04] know Adam could have come right out but
[1:04:06] Adam instead of coming out
[1:04:08] he heared they hid themselves and notice
[1:04:10] the love of God was trying to call him
[1:04:13] out but we find that when they come to
[1:04:15] that spot here we find that Adam says
[1:04:17] were Lord it really ain't my fault
[1:04:20] it's the woman you gave me now notice
[1:04:23] this before that
[1:04:24] when Adam took her out of knowing that
[1:04:27] if he did not place his life in there
[1:04:30] then if he did not place that life in
[1:04:33] there in her womb God would come down
[1:04:35] and kill her but because his life was
[1:04:37] there in the womb God could not kill her
[1:04:41] so he addresses Adam now remember when
[1:04:44] he addresses out of notice the condition
[1:04:46] now of the fall when Adam took was a
[1:04:49] partaker of the fruit immediately Adam
[1:04:52] looks over and he says it's the woman
[1:04:54] you gave me she's the reason I'm in this
[1:04:56] fix that I'm in and now then he comes to
[1:04:59] the woman okay he says why is it that
[1:05:01] that is thus what does she say it's
[1:05:03] because of the serpent he beguiled me
[1:05:05] you see what happens when love they were
[1:05:08] walking in divine love but when they got
[1:05:10] out of divine love they no longer we're
[1:05:13] looking at their life and evaluating it
[1:05:15] they were looking for somebody to blame
[1:05:18] for the situation or the condition they
[1:05:21] were in all about how much greater when
[1:05:23] God's love returns to you and I by that
[1:05:26] of divine grace we're not looking for
[1:05:28] somebody to blame we're not looking way
[1:05:30] back they're to blame we realized that
[1:05:32] we were lost and I'm done we are in need
[1:05:35] of the mercy of Almighty God we are
[1:05:38] repenting and we are asking God for
[1:05:40] forgiveness in our life what brings that
[1:05:43] about but divine love of God unmerited
[1:05:46] grace Oh glory be to God this is why
[1:05:50] when Jesus would stand there in John
[1:05:52] 18:36 and he was asked a question
[1:05:54] remember by Pilate was he a king or not
[1:05:57] and he said My Kingdom is not of the
[1:06:00] world if my kingdom were of this world
[1:06:02] then would my servants fight see how it
[1:06:06] is the kingdom of this world that of
[1:06:09] even our connectivity by our first birth
[1:06:11] is that of a fight
[1:06:14] oh mama that I should not be delivered
[1:06:19] to the Jews but now is my kingdom not
[1:06:23] from thence right now it's not from
[1:06:25] Finn's so now he's not gonna operate by
[1:06:28] the laws or by the ways of this kingdom
[1:06:31] remember the ways of this kingdom it
[1:06:33] says if you take me then those that are
[1:06:35] with me they're gonna fight for my
[1:06:37] deliverance but he lets them know we're
[1:06:39] not fighting for control of this world
[1:06:42] but we and there is a there is a an
[1:06:45] actual decree and there is an actual
[1:06:48] word the Word of God that this of the
[1:06:50] earth it belongs to the sons and
[1:06:53] daughters of God the earth listen to me
[1:06:55] now as much as our soul needed
[1:06:57] Redemption the earth is a redeemable
[1:07:00] attribute of Almighty God the world is
[1:07:03] only the system the cosmos that is
[1:07:05] opponent but as much as our souls need
[1:07:08] in Redemption and leading our bodies to
[1:07:10] redemption the earth itself is longing
[1:07:13] and in need of redemption it's got its
[1:07:16] water baptism in the days of Noah it's
[1:07:19] received out of the blood dropping and
[1:07:21] placing a claim sanctification upon it
[1:07:24] and the baptism of fire will break out
[1:07:27] in the Millennium in a further working
[1:07:29] of sanctification and then all clear
[1:07:31] over to the future home where that the
[1:07:33] earth itself receives the baptism of the
[1:07:36] Holy Ghost is that new city that new
[1:07:39] Jerusalem you see that's what has
[1:07:41] already happened in our soul when we've
[1:07:43] actually been born again of the Spirit
[1:07:45] of God we have been born of that mother
[1:07:48] our mother is that New Jerusalem we have
[1:07:51] been born of the life of that city or
[1:07:54] glory be to God he who is our milk
[1:07:56] ascetic we have been born of his life
[1:07:59] and so the administration in the life of
[1:08:02] a son and daughter of God is no longer
[1:08:04] of the world we do not love the world or
[1:08:06] the things of the world but the love of
[1:08:08] God is shed abroad in our hearts what is
[1:08:11] it it's another Kingdom that has already
[1:08:14] moved in that's why we can say I walk in
[1:08:17] this world but yet I'm not of this world
[1:08:20] we realize as children of God we're
[1:08:22] actually walking in two different worlds
[1:08:25] at the same time no
[1:08:27] Jesus could say but you see the son of
[1:08:29] man here he is on earth and yet he's
[1:08:31] already ascended into heaven why because
[1:08:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:08:36] quickening power to a child of God he
[1:08:38] raises us into heavenly places though we
[1:08:41] walk here in this earth but we have our
[1:08:44] position in Christ in heavenly places Oh
[1:08:48] glory be to God so here when we begin to
[1:08:52] look at this we find that what he come
[1:08:54] to do he come to conquer hatred you see
[1:08:58] hatred itself had a way that it would
[1:09:00] actually bring division and you think
[1:09:03] about this in this regards then anytime
[1:09:05] there's ever been a war or a battle that
[1:09:08] has been fought many times when whoever
[1:09:11] becomes the ruling party then whoever is
[1:09:14] the losing party they actually then they
[1:09:17] never have just a a real gratefulness
[1:09:19] they never have a real thankfulness but
[1:09:21] what it actually comes down to these
[1:09:24] types of victories that would be fought
[1:09:26] between nations it actually ends up in
[1:09:29] being hatred one who's overtaken and
[1:09:31] here they are you know let's say that
[1:09:33] you know when you know this nation a
[1:09:36] took over nation be nation a can go in
[1:09:39] there let's just look for example when
[1:09:40] America went into Iraq and America goes
[1:09:43] into Iraq and just lay aside your
[1:09:45] political viewpoints right now and let's
[1:09:46] just let me preach so when you look at
[1:09:48] this when they go into Iraq you know
[1:09:50] you'll find maybe a degree of certain
[1:09:52] ones here there that they're real
[1:09:54] appreciative you know maybe that there
[1:09:56] was certain and liberation from
[1:09:57] oppression but you find there were
[1:09:59] others that you and I should think good
[1:10:01] Lord they ought to be thankful they
[1:10:03] ought to be appreciative of being
[1:10:05] liberated they ought to be appreciative
[1:10:06] but you see that type of war only leaves
[1:10:09] the leaves hatred it leaves it what you
[1:10:11] and I see we're here they are coming
[1:10:13] against the Americans they can see an
[1:10:15] American and listen that American might
[1:10:17] be working over there and that American
[1:10:19] may not have even been for the war at
[1:10:20] all but all they see is that's an
[1:10:22] American and they look at it and let's
[1:10:24] take them out you see it only produces a
[1:10:27] hatred they may not even know you but
[1:10:29] there's a hatred that's produced that's
[1:10:31] what those kind of wars produce but you
[1:10:34] see that's what Satan had done in the
[1:10:36] beginning it had brought a hatred but
[1:10:38] you see God himself
[1:10:40] god is love he did not come down with
[1:10:43] army takes bullets and that of carnal
[1:10:46] means to try to overthrow and move in a
[1:10:49] carnal way why the same problem would
[1:10:51] have existed even within us and within
[1:10:54] mankind there has to be a liberation and
[1:10:58] that liberation must come from the time
[1:11:01] of our first birth there must come a
[1:11:03] Liberty by the love of God that takes
[1:11:06] its place in the heart of man to where
[1:11:09] man's life is governed by the love of
[1:11:12] God anything outside of that produces a
[1:11:14] hatred let me just say this to you no
[1:11:16] wonder why you find that there are
[1:11:17] people who walk away from this message
[1:11:20] and this truth and they absolutely they
[1:11:22] don't just walk away and say well I
[1:11:23] don't understand it but the Spirit
[1:11:25] behind them is a spirit of destruction
[1:11:27] the spirit hates this message it hates
[1:11:31] it you see what it is it's a spirit
[1:11:33] behind it and they'll say man I'm free
[1:11:35] I've never been freer than I've ever
[1:11:37] been before well certainly they are if
[1:11:39] they feel free you know why
[1:11:41] they've set here like a bunch of
[1:11:42] hypocrites they've never been born again
[1:11:44] of the Spirit of God they never had the
[1:11:47] love of God within their heart the
[1:11:50] message was only intellectualism it was
[1:11:52] only theology it was only doctrine they
[1:11:55] only used it listen to me closely now
[1:11:58] they only used it to their own advantage
[1:12:01] for a certain period of time and then
[1:12:04] once it got them to a certain advantage
[1:12:06] point they see no problem with
[1:12:08] dismissing it what is it it's because
[1:12:11] their heart was not filled with the love
[1:12:13] of God brother the love of God the Holy
[1:12:16] Ghost coming into a heart it overthrows
[1:12:19] hatred and resentment listen what the
[1:12:21] Bible says when we love God His
[1:12:24] commandments are no longer Grievous Oh
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:30] glory be to God
[1:12:33] amen he came he came to conquer hatred
[1:12:37] he come with a different weapon listen
[1:12:41] to me now he looked upon the sick and
[1:12:43] the sick but demon-possessed he was able
[1:12:47] to look and he's seen beneath the demons
[1:12:51] the demon spitting on him the demon
[1:12:53] saying everything but it looked beyond
[1:12:55] that and he said there's my son beneath
[1:12:58] that there my daughter beneath that amen
[1:13:03] when it came to the woman at the well he
[1:13:05] looked at me the darkness that was on
[1:13:07] her life what did that the love of God
[1:13:10] man's eyes was like the disciples what's
[1:13:13] he doing talking to a woman like that
[1:13:15] the Pharisees remember in Luke 17 when
[1:13:18] Jesus uses the parable of the prodigal
[1:13:20] son he uses it in that matter because
[1:13:23] the Pharisees they wanted nothing to do
[1:13:25] with sinners they were afraid if they
[1:13:27] got within a certain distance of them
[1:13:28] they would somehow be contaminated what
[1:13:30] they didn't realize they were already
[1:13:32] more contaminated than the sinners were
[1:13:34] they were full of dead men's bones they
[1:13:38] themselves jesus said you have not the
[1:13:40] love of God abiding in you yet they
[1:13:43] themselves had so many outward things
[1:13:45] among them oh let me get on this now but
[1:13:48] you realize that it was able to look
[1:13:50] beneath and see what was really needed
[1:13:52] I'll tell you that's what the world is
[1:13:54] dying for the world is dying for the
[1:13:57] love of God the world is not dying for
[1:13:59] hatred they can make all sorts of laws
[1:14:01] and everything else but you know what
[1:14:03] there's one thing that's a great
[1:14:05] governing principle and that is love
[1:14:08] notice how the scripture this is the
[1:14:11] weapon the Prophet was letting us know
[1:14:12] this is the weapon that he used of love
[1:14:15] in Song of Solomon chapter 8 verse 5 who
[1:14:18] is this that cometh up from the
[1:14:20] wilderness leaning upon her beloved I
[1:14:22] raised thee up up up under this apple
[1:14:25] tree
[1:14:25] there thy mother brought thee forth
[1:14:28] there she brought thee forth that bare
[1:14:30] thee sent me as a seal upon my heart as
[1:14:33] a seal upon thine arm notice this is the
[1:14:37] request of the bridegroom to the bride
[1:14:39] for love is as strong as death so the
[1:14:43] seal the setting upon the heart is that
[1:14:46] of love and he goes on to portray it for
[1:14:49] you and I that love is as strong as
[1:14:51] death death is working in our body right
[1:14:53] now just as death itself you look at
[1:14:55] mounted pictures as you look at pictures
[1:14:57] of where you were a few years ago you
[1:15:00] might see more wrinkles you might see a
[1:15:01] few more strands has been gone off maybe
[1:15:04] if
[1:15:04] few more gray hairs what's happening
[1:15:06] death working in your body it was
[1:15:08] already there it kept working but how
[1:15:10] much greater is well this is how love
[1:15:12] works love overthrows love overtakes
[1:15:17] in our life Oh blow ray and notice
[1:15:20] jealousy is as cruel as the great here's
[1:15:22] the comparison to love once again the
[1:15:24] coals thereof our coals of fire which
[1:15:28] hath a most vehement flame many waters
[1:15:32] cannot quench love o my you know water
[1:15:35] can't put this fire out this is not a
[1:15:38] man-made fire come on somebody many
[1:15:40] waters cannot quench it neither can the
[1:15:43] floods drown it
[1:15:44] Satanists tried to when the enemy comes
[1:15:47] in like a flood the Spirit of God will
[1:15:49] raise a standard against the word
[1:15:51] remember many waters many floods many
[1:15:54] waters remember the sitteth upon
[1:15:56] many waters of all of her doctrines and
[1:15:59] people's and everything else but yet the
[1:16:02] love of God cannot be overthrown but
[1:16:05] vice-versa the love of God is actually
[1:16:08] moving in the hearts of the people of
[1:16:10] God and the kingdom of God is going on
[1:16:13] though Satan has been against it he's
[1:16:15] tried to throw him in lions he's tried
[1:16:17] to feed him to the Lions
[1:16:19] put him in the vats to try and boil it
[1:16:21] out of them he's tried to bring tests
[1:16:22] and trials her away he's tried to get
[1:16:25] you so discouraged he's tried to tell
[1:16:27] you that this message is the reason why
[1:16:30] you can't really have joy it's because
[1:16:32] of this but he's alive there's never
[1:16:34] been a greater joy than the word that
[1:16:37] has become life and given you in our
[1:16:40] life it is our joy and we recognize that
[1:16:43] no matter but tests or trials that come
[1:16:45] but through it all all the floods and
[1:16:48] all the waters it cannot quench it it
[1:16:51] cannot drown it even when we're at our
[1:16:54] lowest time the fire of God the love of
[1:16:57] God still burns bright
[1:16:59] no wonder Paul said nothing shall be
[1:17:02] able to separate us from the love of God
[1:17:09] if a man would give all the substance of
[1:17:13] his house for love it would utterly be
[1:17:16] condemned it shows real love has nothing
[1:17:20] to do with how much you own in life
[1:17:26] love is priceless
[1:17:34] see that example between those two
[1:17:36] couples brother Branham had married I
[1:17:38] want you to think of this rudram takes
[1:17:42] this point and why are people so tossed
[1:17:46] about and he talks about how he says he
[1:17:49] stood in a man's meeting that had a tent
[1:17:53] and he says I'm not slamming this man
[1:17:57] God forgive me he said but where a man
[1:18:00] said he could cast out evil spirits
[1:18:02] listen to this statement which I have no
[1:18:06] doubt of that but evil spirits are not
[1:18:12] cast out by cruel indifferent living the
[1:18:18] most powerful weapon there is in the
[1:18:21] world is love see the discernment of the
[1:18:28] Spirit of God brother Branham was saying
[1:18:29] though that man's line he can't cast out
[1:18:31] evil spirits he's saying I don't doubt
[1:18:33] that he can cast out evil spirits but
[1:18:35] what's he dealing with that though there
[1:18:37] can be things take place many moving and
[1:18:40] merry miracles and things like that but
[1:18:42] yet he does not have better the gospel
[1:18:45] life to actually be able to break that
[1:18:48] yoke of bondage and man can not do that
[1:18:50] that takes the Holy Spirit himself this
[1:18:53] is why brother Branham would say and you
[1:18:55] must be born again 1961 false teachers
[1:18:58] produce false births why because they
[1:19:01] put it up on something that's not true
[1:19:04] whatsoever and yet many false teachers
[1:19:06] can have all kinds of science and all
[1:19:08] kinds of wonders but remember you don't
[1:19:10] know a man by his signs and wonders you
[1:19:12] know him by his teaching his fruit and
[1:19:15] what is it the fruit is that where the
[1:19:17] teaching the life goes forth and it
[1:19:20] moves within the lives
[1:19:21] so notice brother Brown notice where the
[1:19:23] Spirit of God is going it's going down
[1:19:26] behind of even the man who is standing
[1:19:28] out there and saying I can cast out evil
[1:19:30] spirits remember though I have faith to
[1:19:33] move mountains and have not charity I am
[1:19:37] nothing is that right
[1:19:40] so when we notice here remember the way
[1:19:43] listen to me now
[1:19:45] the way that the Spirit of God comes it
[1:19:48] travels through the body
[1:19:50] is that right we see it in the book of
[1:19:53] Acts we see it where Philip went down to
[1:19:55] the eunuch it was the Spirit of God
[1:19:56] leading him down there we seem that
[1:19:59] while Peter yet spake we see in other
[1:20:01] times were Paul lay his hands upon them
[1:20:03] it was the same Spirit of God moved
[1:20:06] through that of the body it did not
[1:20:08] produce little Peters and little pause
[1:20:10] it actually was that same life that what
[1:20:13] did it do it brought forth the image of
[1:20:15] Christ in the lives of those individuals
[1:20:17] so it is not by cruel and indifferent
[1:20:19] living notice the Spirit of God is going
[1:20:22] to the depth within this guy who has the
[1:20:24] tent inside of his life his own private
[1:20:26] life his own private life he might a
[1:20:28] drink his own private life there were
[1:20:31] many of them had many great miracles and
[1:20:32] things I can't step off the plane over
[1:20:34] here in Cleveland and couldn't even make
[1:20:36] it down the ramp but yet had many
[1:20:38] miracles in their ministry tremendous
[1:20:41] miracles you see amid the grace of God
[1:20:43] that we recognize is something greater
[1:20:46] that we're to hear the call of the word
[1:20:48] rather the word the world has miracles
[1:20:51] the word has signs and wonders but the
[1:20:53] word brings about a life that that life
[1:20:56] stays in liberty that life itself
[1:21:00] becomes settled in Jesus Christ so not
[1:21:04] by cruel and indifferent living the most
[1:21:07] powerful weapon there is in the world is
[1:21:09] love now let me just give you this
[1:21:11] example maybe that will somewhat help
[1:21:14] when it comes to how that the Lord Jesus
[1:21:16] moving about and moving down within our
[1:21:18] lives now we read here in the scripture
[1:21:21] where it said that while we were yet
[1:21:22] sinners yet he died for us
[1:21:24] we were unlovable this is what the
[1:21:26] scripture said when we were unlovable
[1:21:28] yet he himself gave himself for us when
[1:21:31] we absolutely there was no merits or
[1:21:35] even the slightest little thing that we
[1:21:39] could have said oh you know here's a lot
[1:21:41] of here 99% bad but that one little
[1:21:44] sliver oh man I'll lay my life on the
[1:21:46] line there was nothing good about you or
[1:21:49] I are you with me but yet he himself
[1:21:54] what was love doing love was conquering
[1:21:57] oh my he came with the word and love was
[1:22:02] using the word now brother BAM uses this
[1:22:04] example you familiar have I've preached
[1:22:06] from this many different times but where
[1:22:08] you had the man who was a young minister
[1:22:10] but the RAM said you know he was a young
[1:22:12] Pentecostal and brother BAM said the
[1:22:13] problem with him he had watched too many
[1:22:16] of these meetings where they were
[1:22:17] grabbing people and casting out spirits
[1:22:19] look Graham said that was his problem
[1:22:21] and he says now what it was he said now
[1:22:23] you know here he went in and he would
[1:22:26] grab his wife his wife was a Lutheran
[1:22:27] they were always in contention one with
[1:22:30] another when he would come in she would
[1:22:32] say hi I guess you all shouted and spoke
[1:22:34] in tongues tonight and whatever more now
[1:22:37] remember he would walk over to her and
[1:22:39] brother and say this is what he told
[1:22:40] brother Branham he would grab her and
[1:22:42] rule her out in the middle of floor and
[1:22:44] he's out there I cast you out know what
[1:22:47] he's doing he simply was watching what
[1:22:49] he saw in meetings but there was an
[1:22:52] element he was missing behind it you see
[1:22:55] the element that he was missing was
[1:22:57] really love his approach to the word the
[1:23:01] word was right the word will cast out
[1:23:03] spirits brother and sister you realize
[1:23:05] when a heart a heart can be sent right
[1:23:07] here in the pew they don't even have to
[1:23:08] come up front but if they're sent right
[1:23:10] there in their heart begins to go with
[1:23:12] the word you realize what the Word of
[1:23:14] God is doing it's actually cutting away
[1:23:16] demons while they're sitting there and
[1:23:18] their heart is agreeing with the Word of
[1:23:20] God you don't have to have hands laid on
[1:23:22] you to cast out a devil sure there are
[1:23:25] some circumstances and things or I've
[1:23:27] witnessed within that that a person
[1:23:30] actually needs encouragement they need
[1:23:32] help but you do not go do that by force
[1:23:34] you do it by divine love for the soul
[1:23:37] that's down there so my water Liberty
[1:23:40] that gives to you and I you that's
[1:23:42] ending at home this morning you might be
[1:23:44] in front of your computer your tablet
[1:23:45] your phone you whatever it is but to
[1:23:47] realize the word when you allow that
[1:23:49] word to come in and you agree with the
[1:23:52] word take your eyes off yourself and
[1:23:55] agree with the word the word itself it
[1:23:57] comes out of his mouth as a sharp
[1:23:59] two-edged sword
[1:24:00] it actually liberates it'll not only cut
[1:24:03] spirits of depression and oppression it
[1:24:06] will actually cut away spirits of
[1:24:08] sickness it'll cut away spirits of doubt
[1:24:11] and unbelief this is the power of the
[1:24:14] word of God love itself overcomes it
[1:24:17] overthrows that of the hold of the enemy
[1:24:20] now notice this program said what had
[1:24:23] happened here in this particular place
[1:24:25] it was between this husband and wife it
[1:24:28] was almost
[1:24:29] for skates but he said now he said
[1:24:31] brother branham he said I just can't
[1:24:33] seem and I don't have this up there but
[1:24:35] I want you to listen to me I just can't
[1:24:37] seem to move that Devil out of her
[1:24:42] you see he's saying something that's
[1:24:46] right on but he's not even catching what
[1:24:48] he's saying I just can't seem to move
[1:24:51] that Devil out of her you say well what
[1:24:53] has to be done recognize there's a devil
[1:24:55] and there's her recognize the devil's
[1:24:59] the one you're angry with not her come
[1:25:04] on somebody you see this is what the
[1:25:06] Lord Jesus did notice bill Ramsey said
[1:25:10] you go about it the wrong way
[1:25:12] he said when she starts out like that
[1:25:14] you say all right dear
[1:25:16] bless your heart honey and be real kind
[1:25:19] to her not to the devil to her just see
[1:25:25] how much you can do for her we mean the
[1:25:30] help of the Holy Spirit you see what
[1:25:32] love does without love governing where
[1:25:36] we end up butchering people up no wonder
[1:25:40] they don't want to talk to us about
[1:25:41] anything about God preach brother Samuel
[1:25:45] why you've got to have the word governed
[1:25:48] by love and if it isn't love pulsating
[1:25:52] into it then you've walked right into a
[1:25:54] man they need to hear this they got to
[1:25:56] do that right away you're defeated
[1:25:58] because what there has to be a
[1:26:01] discernment between her and the devil
[1:26:06] all right now he said brother Branham
[1:26:09] how will I ever give the devil out of
[1:26:12] her once against he's not recognizing it
[1:26:14] he said you do as I say and just keep
[1:26:20] praying in your heart God will take care
[1:26:23] of the rest of it he called brother
[1:26:26] Branham up in about two three weeks he
[1:26:27] said my home's revolutionized my wife is
[1:26:32] a different person baby BAM said which
[1:26:36] is the most powerful screaming kicking
[1:26:39] stomping or putting your arms
[1:26:41] around in love this is the reality of
[1:26:45] the token let it be a plant this is the
[1:26:48] words of the Spirit of God through the
[1:26:49] Prophet let it be a prize with love and
[1:26:52] consideration let it be an atmosphere in
[1:26:55] your home bet your loved ones misses his
[1:26:58] words they will fall into it Oh glory be
[1:27:03] to God
[1:27:04] notice here the Lord Jesus here we find
[1:27:07] John would write of this and let me just
[1:27:10] let me move here just a little bit
[1:27:11] herein is our love made perfect that we
[1:27:16] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:27:18] this is confidence if we can have
[1:27:20] confidence in the day of judgment which
[1:27:22] you and I and ourselves we don't know
[1:27:24] how long we have upon this earth but
[1:27:26] even when we look ahead to that moment
[1:27:28] we want to have confidence and the
[1:27:30] confidence that we have in regards to
[1:27:32] the day of judgment if we've got
[1:27:34] confidence regarding that
[1:27:35] then we've got confidence to live every
[1:27:37] moment of the day because as he is
[1:27:41] remember he raised up seated on the
[1:27:45] right hand of God he's seated in power
[1:27:47] he is our mediator I find no fault in
[1:27:51] him come on someone because as he is so
[1:27:55] are we in this world you look at this
[1:27:58] remember that's where you need the
[1:28:00] discernment of the love of God what is
[1:28:02] he looking at as he is so are we in this
[1:28:05] world it is that same perfection be you
[1:28:08] therefore perfect even as your father
[1:28:10] isn't in heaven is perfect what
[1:28:13] perfection is he talking about he's
[1:28:15] talking about the perfection that comes
[1:28:18] from the life that is within the blood
[1:28:20] and this is the confidence that we have
[1:28:22] because within our hearts the love of
[1:28:25] the world is gone the desire is to
[1:28:27] please him there is no fear in love but
[1:28:32] perfect love casts out fear
[1:28:35] when fear wants to try to come perfect
[1:28:38] love cast it out the devil comes along
[1:28:41] and says you know what at the end of the
[1:28:44] time you're not going to make it but the
[1:28:45] RAM send the token what does it do he
[1:28:47] said you say I already got the token
[1:28:50] perfect love cast
[1:28:52] fear hey man so how is love cast out by
[1:28:57] perfect love and that's all of Satan's
[1:29:00] Kingdom because fear hath torment he
[1:29:05] that feareth is not made perfect in love
[1:29:08] we love him because he first loved us so
[1:29:15] how was it that it was drawn out of our
[1:29:18] hearts to where come to a place of
[1:29:20] surrender that the love of God could be
[1:29:22] shed abroad in our hearts because he
[1:29:24] loved us first go Paul would say in
[1:29:27] Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with
[1:29:29] Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but
[1:29:32] Christ liveth in me and the life which I
[1:29:34] now live in the flesh I live by the
[1:29:37] faith of the Son of God who loved me and
[1:29:40] gave himself for me Paul said I cannot
[1:29:45] know about everybody else but I know
[1:29:47] it's been made personal to me that's
[1:29:51] what has to be made personal to you and
[1:29:53] I when that is made personal to an
[1:29:56] individual sin flees brother you don't
[1:29:59] have to worry about trying to clean up
[1:30:01] and straighten up it flees from your
[1:30:03] life why because the love is gone it's
[1:30:08] not about us trying to put new leaves on
[1:30:09] you get and you get life on the inside
[1:30:11] the leaves will just come out is that
[1:30:14] right notice Paul would go on in
[1:30:16] Ephesians 2:4 but God who is rich in
[1:30:19] mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:30:22] loved us even when we were dead in our
[1:30:25] sins hath quickened us together with
[1:30:27] Christ by grace you are saved and hath
[1:30:29] raised us up together and made us sit
[1:30:32] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:30:35] Jesus that in the ages to come he might
[1:30:37] show the exceeding riches of His grace
[1:30:40] in his kindness toward us through Christ
[1:30:43] Jesus let me just carefully warn you do
[1:30:46] not let these be scriptures that you
[1:30:48] just know by mind these are scriptures
[1:30:51] that must be not only revealed but they
[1:30:54] must be that where we recognize in our
[1:30:57] heart what great love has been expressed
[1:30:59] to us not just that he died on Calvary
[1:31:02] but Paul brought it down in Ephesians
[1:31:04] because remember
[1:31:05] Moses couldn't take us over but Joshua
[1:31:08] the Holy Ghost sent back can pack us
[1:31:10] into the land so it's not just that
[1:31:12] Jesus died on the cross remember many
[1:31:15] can believe on him and believe on the
[1:31:19] work that he did and they will be saved
[1:31:21] but there's a difference from believing
[1:31:23] on and believing in him when you believe
[1:31:26] in him when that revelation of Jesus
[1:31:29] Christ is revealed to you that your sin
[1:31:32] debt is paid brother and the life of the
[1:31:34] atonement moves on the inside of you you
[1:31:37] have now been raised up the same way the
[1:31:40] Spirit of God raised that dead body up
[1:31:43] you and I go walking around on earth we
[1:31:46] were dead what part of us was dead that
[1:31:48] seed on the inside it was laying there
[1:31:51] dormant but there had to be the right
[1:31:54] waters the waters of life of the waters
[1:31:57] of his own life that would come across
[1:31:59] that of the seed and would raise that
[1:32:02] sea into heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:32:06] what are we witnessing what are we
[1:32:09] partakers of the great love of Almighty
[1:32:12] God the great love of God that has come
[1:32:16] from the very mind of God and moved down
[1:32:19] into the heart of the believer this is
[1:32:24] why brother Branham would express this
[1:32:26] to us in Christ the mystery of God
[1:32:28] revealed and he would let us know and
[1:32:31] speak with us very clearly on what the
[1:32:33] what better the new birth is it's the
[1:32:36] revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:32:38] personally he would let us know you
[1:32:41] don't make converts to Christianity by
[1:32:43] its laws and its governments there are
[1:32:45] many different laws there are things
[1:32:47] that listen when the word is coming
[1:32:49] forth the word is given to you and I and
[1:32:51] the word will admonish us the word will
[1:32:54] speak to us the word will help us and we
[1:32:56] can take that word when it's revealed to
[1:32:58] us the Spirit of God will take that word
[1:33:01] and we can say Lord may my body come
[1:33:03] into complete obedience to that word
[1:33:06] what is that that's mortifying the
[1:33:08] members of our body and the Spirit of
[1:33:10] God on the inside is bringing that body
[1:33:12] into subjection so here it is all a
[1:33:16] divine working by the spirit of all
[1:33:18] my god notice in Revelations 1 verse 5
[1:33:21] and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:33:25] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:33:28] of the Dead and the Prince of the kings
[1:33:31] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[1:33:33] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[1:33:37] notice he loved us conquering and he
[1:33:41] loosed us this is what washing means he
[1:33:44] loosed us we are no longer tied to that
[1:33:48] old man that's why we stand justified in
[1:33:51] the sight of God as though we never did
[1:33:54] it in the first place because the real
[1:33:56] you or me on the inside it never did do
[1:33:59] it but it took the Spirit of God to
[1:34:02] raise up that reality that real son and
[1:34:05] daughter of God only inside him begin to
[1:34:07] move upon our life like you did the
[1:34:09] prodigal son we begin to recognize the
[1:34:11] condition we were in and we begin to
[1:34:13] have a hunger oh if I can only get back
[1:34:15] to my father's house
[1:34:17] there's prayer in my father's house he
[1:34:19] was calling for bread bread being a
[1:34:21] staff of life he had a remembrance that
[1:34:23] begin to deal with him of that of home
[1:34:25] what is it it's the spirit of cloth the
[1:34:28] love of God is going out there it's
[1:34:30] dealing with the prodigal son the
[1:34:32] Prophet would say it this clear he said
[1:34:34] mom and Daddy were at home praying for
[1:34:36] him and the angel of the Lord was down
[1:34:38] in the Pigpen
[1:34:38] let me tell you something the angel of
[1:34:41] the Lord was not ashamed to walk in the
[1:34:43] Pigpen
[1:34:44] because when the angel of the Lord comes
[1:34:46] brother he don't leave people in a
[1:34:48] pigpen he brings liberty he knows if I
[1:34:51] can only get that life and that life
[1:34:53] begins to hearken that life begins to
[1:34:56] line up I can move in that life and snip
[1:34:59] him and not I'll have to worry about a
[1:35:01] pigpen no more because why the very
[1:35:04] nature of the pig on the inside has died
[1:35:07] and that sheet that was for our day and
[1:35:10] foreknown before the foundation of the
[1:35:13] world the Sheep has heard the call of
[1:35:15] the shepherd it has responded to its
[1:35:18] creator to its maker under him to loved
[1:35:24] us and washed us from our sins in his
[1:35:28] own blood
[1:35:30] and has made us kings and priests unto
[1:35:32] God and his father to him be glory and
[1:35:37] Dominion for ever and ever amen let me
[1:35:44] read this to you just give me just a
[1:35:49] couple minutes this is out of a message

[1:36:08] I talked about this morning how can
[1:36:11] overcome God come to us God sought you
[1:36:18] you never sought God no man can come to
[1:36:22] me except the father draws him first
[1:36:25] notice not pulls him not pushes him
[1:36:28] draws him this is what love draws he and
[1:36:33] God came down in that muck what you were
[1:36:38] God came down in that muck what you were
[1:36:43] and sought you out and brought you out
[1:36:48] that ought to create a perfect love look
[1:36:53] what you was and look what you are what
[1:36:58] you are what you are what did that
[1:37:03] somebody that loves you can't you have
[1:37:07] faith in what he's promised you then
[1:37:09] real genuine love will create a
[1:37:13] confidence in his word he caught me when
[1:37:19] I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm
[1:37:23] in his hand he caught me he loved me
[1:37:29] when I was unlovable he loved you when
[1:37:33] you was unable lovable but he changed
[1:37:36] you just like the colored sister said in
[1:37:39] her testimony I'm not what I ought to be
[1:37:41] I'm not what I want to be but I think
[1:37:43] God I'm not what I used to be
[1:37:45] she knowed she had come somewhere
[1:37:49] something had happened and that's the
[1:37:53] way it is if God when he when I was an
[1:37:57] alien from him so loved me till he
[1:38:00] stooped down to get me and pick me up
[1:38:03] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:38:08] to use me he's got a purpose in doing it
[1:38:11] he
[1:38:11] seen something in me notice he was able
[1:38:15] to see the difference he did not look at
[1:38:17] my life and say nothing but a drunkard
[1:38:19] nothing but it is nothing but our there
[1:38:20] he realized those are only spirits
[1:38:22] that's driving him right now
[1:38:25] hallelujah let's stoop down and love

[1:38:42] how do you mean laws I needed
[1:38:45] deliverance
[1:38:46] [Music]

[1:38:52] you realize it's not laws it's not this
[1:38:56] and don'ts its life its life brother it
[1:39:02] produces the life of Jesus Christ

[1:39:26] oh my rear I wish I had time to preach
[1:39:29] what I really feel burning in my heart
[1:39:30] right now he had a reason to save you
[1:39:33] look at the people that's unsaved today
[1:39:39] he walked down in the pull of Salome
[1:39:42] excuse me pardon me
[1:39:45] skew host excuse me pardon me he stepped
[1:39:50] over people that were in worse shape
[1:39:52] than you or me came to a man who was
[1:39:56] slaying impotent brother Bram said he
[1:39:58] had a condition and when they killed him
[1:40:00] but the man could not get to the water
[1:40:02] but the one who sent the angels came to
[1:40:08] him hallelujah he stepped over it called
[1:40:16] being called Beelzebub he stepped over
[1:40:18] being called a fortune teller he stepped
[1:40:22] over what was he doing he was coming to
[1:40:24] get you and me gal repeated God oh my
[1:40:32] look at the people that's unsaved today
[1:40:34] look at the millions he could have took
[1:40:37] besides you but he took you oh man no
[1:40:41] one can take your place you're in God's
[1:40:43] economy no one can do it
[1:40:45] that's his love to you but in saying
[1:40:51] what does this have to do with the
[1:40:52] strong hand of faith remember our faith
[1:40:55] is a divine revelation that is to be
[1:40:58] built upon the love of God it's the word
[1:41:04] that's to be handled by the love of God
[1:41:08] it's the love of God that will constrain
[1:41:11] us and cause us to wait for his leading
[1:41:14] we might have the word but we're just
[1:41:16] waiting on his unction of how to move
[1:41:19] about it it's love that gives us
[1:41:22] confidence what is it his love seated in
[1:41:26] our heart then won't your love reach
[1:41:29] back to him and there's a love affair no
[1:41:31] matter what the situation is its
[1:41:35] circumstances is governed by this love
[1:41:39] that creates
[1:41:42] notice the circumstances is governed by
[1:41:45] this love that creates faith that God
[1:41:53] loves you and you love God and you love
[1:41:57] one another and that brings faith oh you
[1:42:03] said perfect faith it's pure it's just
[1:42:05] as pure as love this so when you love
[1:42:08] somebody and you got love your husband
[1:42:09] or you love your wife
[1:42:10] now there's no need anybody telling you
[1:42:12] you don't do it you do it because you do
[1:42:14] do it and you know you do it how can you
[1:42:18] prove it
[1:42:18] oh prove it he said I pray it by the way
[1:42:20] I live to him I'm true honest wife I'm a
[1:42:23] loyal honest husband and that proves to
[1:42:25] me but I love my wife
[1:42:26] or my love my husband see your life
[1:42:29] proves what you are
[1:42:31] same thing with Christianity your faith
[1:42:34] you have confidence in one another it's
[1:42:38] pure it's something real that you can't
[1:42:40] show it to somebody else yet you got it
[1:42:43] and your actions prove it
[1:42:47] that unadulterated faith like your love
[1:42:50] is to your companion I'm closing then
[1:42:53] you'll prove it by the way you act
[1:42:54] you ain't complaining no more you know
[1:42:57] it's done you just walk along no matter
[1:43:00] what it looks like what anybody else
[1:43:01] says you know what's happened
[1:43:06] you know it's finished just as well as
[1:43:09] you know you love your husband and he
[1:43:11] says love and faith has to go together
[1:43:15] their kinfolks they love that produces
[1:43:21] faith when Satan tempts us we are to
[1:43:26] resist him in a perfect faith in a
[1:43:30] perfect word like Jesus did how did
[1:43:37] Jesus conquer every devil
[1:43:40] my love it wasn't love for the devil it
[1:43:45] was the love for the word it was the
[1:43:48] love for the father's word to stand
[1:43:50] there even when he was pulled in
[1:43:53] temptation
[1:43:55] they used the word remember let me just
[1:44:00] stop right here and just drop a little
[1:44:02] something
[1:44:05] Jesus in his warfare with the devil he
[1:44:11] brought it to the place that the weakest
[1:44:16] Christian can take the Word of God and
[1:44:21] defeat Satan anywhere anytime under any
[1:44:26] circumstances brother Branham would say
[1:44:29] it in these words he said Jesus showed
[1:44:32] us we didn't have to be strong he said
[1:44:35] we could have weak we could be weak in
[1:44:37] faith but that in itself would overcome
[1:44:41] what is it it's faith in God's Word
[1:44:45] are you with me it's taking that and
[1:44:48] looking for so many times we look at
[1:44:51] things and say well I just seem like I
[1:44:53] don't have big faith you don't need big
[1:44:54] faith
[1:44:56] in a mustard seed faith Jesus never ever
[1:45:02] preached about these great big faiths he
[1:45:05] said if you've got faith the size of a
[1:45:08] grain of a mustard seed
[1:45:12] what brings faith about love love God
[1:45:18] deals with the heart and in love that
[1:45:20] heart is to respond to the Lord and is
[1:45:23] that heart response to God what is it
[1:45:25] faith unto faith Oh what application has
[1:45:31] it comes down to our lives this is how
[1:45:35] then were to use the sword it's how
[1:45:37] we're to use it in our homes it's how to
[1:45:40] you it's how were to use it even where
[1:45:42] I'm when we're among unbelieving family
[1:45:45] members it's how were to use it when
[1:45:48] we're even around the boss
[1:45:53] this is the reality how's it to be
[1:45:55] governed by love by love that the love
[1:46:00] of got one love look what I was look
[1:46:04] what I am now what did that somebody
[1:46:07] they love me somebody that left me
[1:46:11] actually brought that love it wasn't the
[1:46:13] person it was the love of God that love
[1:46:17] that was moving behind there and
[1:46:19] somebody mere you I said God let it be
[1:46:22] that I can be an instrument that the
[1:46:24] love of God can flow through
[1:46:29] helped us to have that patience another
[1:46:36] new you you may have to you you have to
[1:46:38] express the love of God many times
[1:46:39] sometimes for a long time before you can
[1:46:42] ever stop drunk dropping little seeds
[1:46:44] here there what is the love of God it's
[1:46:46] the person of Jesus Christ I want to say
[1:46:52] Lord let all of my actions be governed
[1:46:55] by the love of God if you don't know
[1:47:00] that love of God today in that way just
[1:47:03] inviting men say mighty Conqueror great
[1:47:08] and mighty Conqueror Lord Jesus right in
[1:47:10] Lord upon my life glory be to God him
[1:47:14] listen when he comes in remember he
[1:47:16] won't come in if there's still love of
[1:47:18] the world he said well I found he
[1:47:21] conquers but he conquers my love you see
[1:47:23] what love does love does not say you
[1:47:25] can't do this and you can't do that love
[1:47:27] itself is to draw you to a place
[1:47:30] do you recognize there's something far
[1:47:32] greater than anything of this world it
[1:47:36] draws you to a place till all of these
[1:47:38] things mean nothing and he means
[1:47:42] everything remember
[1:47:44] he conquers by divine love he does not
[1:47:48] come in put us in a headlock no that's
[1:47:50] not how love works that will only bring
[1:47:53] hatred and resentment and spite but his
[1:47:57] love moves in to do what bring about a
[1:48:02] yielding in our life he can get about
[1:48:05] that much of an inch listen to me he
[1:48:07] gets about that much of a little bit
[1:48:08] like that and the more of that personal
[1:48:11] yield the more it will grow and it will
[1:48:14] keep growing it'll keep growing what
[1:48:16] happens love is as strong as death not
[1:48:21] growing in a heart and justification
[1:48:23] it'll grow out to sanctification what
[1:48:26] would I do it'll grow out from
[1:48:28] sanctification into the baptism of the
[1:48:31] Holy Ghost it'll grow to a place so from
[1:48:34] just the welcome mat of my Savior it'll
[1:48:37] move to the place of be the Lord of my
[1:48:39] life
[1:48:42] all yes or Jesus help us Lord I pray oh
[1:48:52] god as we Lord look in your word the
[1:48:58] evaluation as we examine Lord our hearts
[1:49:02] are examined in your presence Lord by
[1:49:05] your word Oh Lord God
[1:49:10] how true this is Lord to every son and
[1:49:15] daughter of God Lord that's been born of
[1:49:18] the Spirit of God we know this reality
[1:49:22] of the love of God what we were and what
[1:49:27] we are now what did it somebody that
[1:49:31] loved me somebody that loved us greater
[1:49:37] love hath no man than this that he a man
[1:49:39] would lay down his life for his friends
[1:49:41] this is the greatness of that love laid
[1:49:45] aside your splendor took upon roads of
[1:49:49] flesh and blood
[1:49:52] and you came down and you read English
[1:49:56] you paid the price
[1:49:58] that is the spirit of life of Atonement
[1:50:02] might go forth could minister to our
[1:50:04] hearts or Jesus you begin dealing with
[1:50:10] our lives like it says in the Book of
[1:50:13] Ezekiel we needed a new heart and a new
[1:50:15] spirit our heart was so hard and it was
[1:50:20] stony but you said I'll take that
[1:50:23] hardest stone out of you
[1:50:24] that hardness that indifference you knew
[1:50:29] what was the cause of our indifference
[1:50:31] our obstinance
[1:50:33] it was that heart that needed to be
[1:50:35] changed then you said I'll give you a
[1:50:38] new spirit because the Lord you knew
[1:50:41] that spirit that we had in us we
[1:50:43] couldn't even get along with ourselves
[1:50:45] much less our neighbors but you came
[1:50:50] down
[1:50:53] and then you put your spirit in us
[1:50:59] causing us to walk in your ways Lord God
[1:51:04] to where our will you surrender to your
[1:51:11] to where as Paul could say it's no
[1:51:14] longer I who live at the Christ who
[1:51:16] liveth in or Jesus I pray this morning
[1:51:22] if there's one under the sound of my
[1:51:23] voice it doesn't know you in that way
[1:51:26] may then may they see
[1:51:29] it's the love of God
[1:51:32] may they recognize Lord maybe Lord lay
[1:51:36] that to heart it's the love of God that
[1:51:39] conquers it's love that conquer sin it's
[1:51:43] love that conquers unbelief it's enough
[1:51:46] that cast out Devils
[1:51:49] it's love that sets the captive free nor
[1:51:55] Jesus I pray O God granite there's never
[1:52:02] been a start in their life may it be a
[1:52:04] start Lord may they start Lord just by
[1:52:07] yielding to that tug upon their life but
[1:52:12] God may each and every one may there be
[1:52:14] a full yielding Lord God across the
[1:52:17] Assembly
[1:52:19] or God where hearts and lives are
[1:52:22] completely filled with the Spirit of God
[1:52:28] may lord I pray in our hearts
[1:52:31] as your children but I want more of the
[1:52:35] love of God to take over more of Santa

[1:52:50] the strong hand of faith the strength
[1:52:55] of the faith to handle this sword comes
[1:53:00] by divine love
[1:53:03] the love of God shed abroad in our lives
[1:53:09] it's what causes us Lord to take your
[1:53:13] word and to stand there
[1:53:16] I pray that Lord Jesus help us may you
[1:53:20] take forward this morning Lord you seen
[1:53:24] how many different Lord God there's so
[1:53:26] many different pathways but I'm
[1:53:29] confident the Lord God as your spirit

[1:53:36] each of our hearts to show us what we
[1:53:39] have needeth helpless Lord God I pray to
[1:53:43] operate with a real discernment and
[1:53:44] wisdom near God as you would instruct us
[1:53:48] just as the Lord Jesus himself come to
[1:53:51] be able to discern between the person
[1:53:53] and the spirit that's motivated
