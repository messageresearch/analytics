i find my battle man praise the lord i'm going to give you a little testimony where i do this song i this might be my last time i give it to you since i'm getting older and one day i'm gonna go home in 1984 i went with james browning to honduras for the first time we went to some pastors meeting in honduras and i was out in i said the boonies you know and towards the end of the meetings you know i never did interpret and uh with the sisters they made some food and their food it was for the pastors the browning ate a little bit and the pastors they later on to us as the evening got they started getting bellyaches the food was messing up their stomach and i remember the brothers that we the brother we that took us there we he didn't put enough gas in the truck so we went around about nine or ten o'clock at night looking for a gas station to go back into the capital but the uh all they had was armed guards and those gas stations so we headed back to the to the to where they had the meetings they took brother browning and put them on a mattress on the floor and they took me to the church and i slept on the cement floor with a little sheet over me about five o'clock in the morning i felt stomach pain so i got up and in those places they have art houses so i got up and went to the outhouse and it wasn't there too long when somebody was trying to get in it was brother browning so i got up and i left them in there and i i went i went from about to where that organ is and i and it was just getting about i'd say daylight and all of a sudden to my right a supernatural being appeared it was a man like on fire and you could see the outline of a man and i looked at that i didn't even know how long that that lasted all i know is here's daylight but the bronx not there so they came running to me the american or the americano so i went running to where he was at they were holding him down he said let tell them to let me go the lord heal me so we went on and and he went on to the capitol and he preached a tremendous message i'll tell you what i was just knew in the message but when he preached that message and he was going into the chuck and the seed and all that and he took his overhead projector back then and i remember him i didn't know all the the terminology you know so i so i uh he took a pause and there was a brother from nicaragua and felipe wrote felipe i said come here felipe this is the bride's message and i don't want to take anything away from her so i sat down he did he preached brother sisters he didn't have to tell him to stand up the whole church stood up in unison with her hands up that's the message of the hour that's the message i thought i thought i'd share that with you it was just wonderful you know i i went to jeffersonville back then early days and i went to visit brother branham's tomb you know and that pillar of fire was just over that just a living thing going over there like this god permitted me to that because see i was just i was raised a catholic i didn't know nothing about prophets but god is merciful all right so now for me listening uh you are great you do miracles so great samuel comes i don't have to start it you know it you're the bride you deserve the glory [Music] sorry [Music] oh i lift my hands in worship and i bless your holy name for you are great you do miracles so great there is no one else like you [Music] there is no one else like you for you are great and you do miracles so great there is no one else like you nobody like you lord [Music] there is no one else like you you are the lamb that was slain before the world [Music] oh worthy to redeem oh [Music] worthy to reading for you shed your blood yes so we could all go free and all the praise belongs belongs to you lord all the praise belongs for you are great and you do miracles we're so grace there is no one else like you oh hallelujah let's just tell him there is no one else oh let's brag on him for you are great and you do miracles so great [Music] nobody else like you jesus no no there is one else [Music] hallelujah oh like david said i will make my boast in the lord all day long for you are great and you do miracles [Music] so great no one else like you lord oh there is no one else like you for you are great thank you lord thank you lord [Music] no one else like you jesus oh there is no one else [Music] like you [Music] hallelujah oh hallelujah oh how we love you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no one else like him amen so many great miracles that god has done is doing and will continue to do [Music] but you know how we thank god when a miracle of the healing of our body but you know the greatest miracle the greatest miracle is a god takes a life and he transforms it by his power because in your body you can get sick again but once the soul has been healed [Applause] that's it that's it that's the greatest miracle amen greatest miracle i believe i'm looking at miracles this morning amen miracles and trophies of god's grace i can stand here as a witness and i can tell you this message works this message that god has sent to us in this hour it works [Music] straight from the throne of god not a man's opinions this message is not the opinions of brother branham are you hearing me it's thus saith the lord from the throne of god [Applause] [Music] are you hearing me [Applause] and here we are standing in this moment just like after gideon they heard the prophet come among them the prophet began to remind him who they were came with a word and began to speak to him and after the prophet's message the angel of the lord came with that message who gave it and came personally to gideon and said you're the one he's talking about the angel of the lord who brought this message it's right here amen that same mighty angel who put one foot upon the land and one foot upon the sea amen he's above every demon power there's not a devil big enough come on somebody god is greater than every circumstance [Music] i don't care what kind of name they want to come out with a disease or come out with this and say oh we never heard of this cancer before one foot upon the land one foot upon the sea hallelujah what has been exalted the name of the lord jesus christ it's a mighty strong tower and the righteous run into it and are safe hallelujah glory be to god oh my how thankful we are in this image is glorious to be gathered together amen in heavenly places amen like brother benny was talking about the other night think about it without the grace of god probably our paths would have never crossed we we didn't even know it i didn't even know it i might know my own natural family tree but i didn't know that you were you were my brother i'm your brother actually there's a stronger connection in christ than there is with the natural family [Music] because that was before hallelujah don't matter what nationality what color what ethnicity we got one father hallelujah glory be to god oh my i'm not the preacher this morning [Laughter] but it's just good together with god's people amen i tell you this these services have just been so wonderful and i just believeth on my heart that god's not finished how many would say lord come and cap off this meeting cap it off lord with yourself hallelujah let's just so invite him we have we have a baptismal here right after as a service this morning amen as brother brother benny will go ahead and make his way we have brother joseph and also sister ethelene going to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord i want to say god bless you the visitors and different ones that that have come and my some that went back to their own assemblies here this morning and we just are so thankful for each and every one of you bringing your lick of fire and coming together thank god for every one of the specials that was sung thank you for yielding your talents to the lord blessing us amen i sure appreciate brother benny amen i really appreciate it amen i really appreciate it and i and we we were just talking i said i love all of god's gifts i said it just what a bouquet of gifts that god has you know you know you know why that is because god loves you and he loves me he don't he don't want every gift to be alike he didn't make it that way but god has set every gift so precisely in the body and he uses that gift to speak to his bride and his bride recognizes that's my husband talking that's my lord talking they can hear beyond the voice the natural voice they hear his voice and i'm so thankful how god has such a variety he comes and he speaks to us i'm grateful for his grace that i can recognize his voice i'm grateful for that hallelujah because there's only one big name among us that name that we're trying to lift up that's the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah oh glory be to god let's just pull on the gift of god i want to say also to sister ruth brother benny's wife because behind every good man has got to be a good solid woman sister ruth would you stand please god bless you thank you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen to each and every one of the brothers and sisters also from south carolina my goodness thank you all for coming thank you [Music] it's been a real blessing to us amen and the good thing about it like i was talking to brother turner here early this morning he said we're going to have a jubilee this morning brothers and i heard brother sammy in the background on the phone i said praise god and you know what we get to have a whole day together [Music] just a little foretaste amen hallelujah could we just could we just stand as we just turn it here the service brother benny we love you we want you just you're at home you know i've told you that ain't service yes you're at home you take your we appreciate you brother thank you amen could we sing this as he comes hallelujah for you are great [Music] [Applause] back there amen so we got got it on so we thank god for you and all the hospitality everything we appreciate each one of the saints and and uh the christian way out how many got the healing last night praise god how many goddamn deliveries last night amen praise god i'm gonna give right to the word and uh certainly appreciate uh brother samuel and everything that he's uh done in the saints and but most of all i thank god for the lord jesus christ it is he that has made us and not we ourselves and so this morning if you have your bibles i like to go to um the book of acts take a scripture out of that amen and then i go to the message things that ought to be praise god acts 7 and verse 17. i want you to pay close attention to that but when the time of the promise drew nine which god had sworn to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt till another king arose which knew not joseph the same dealt separately with our kendricks and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out the young children to the end that they might not live and i like this where i take my thought from in which time moses was born and was exceedingly fair and nourished up in his father's house for three months and let's go if you will things that ought to be very important he says now he says you now now you you grew from your birth when you were born and presented into this world god knew that you were going to be here how many know god knows you're going to be here god knew that you were going to be here and you grew from your birth to maturity things that seemed so strange to you in your young womanhood of young manhood childhood now seems very real you can't understand it you didn't understand it when you was a child but now as you become adult you begin to understand find out that everything was just set just right and you it really meant something to you it really means something to you now the spiritual and the spirit excuse me and it is in your spiritual birth you do things that you don't understand when you a little baby you come here to alter you give your life to christ it's such strange things like that and you wonder why you did it but after a while when you mature as a mature christian then you understand it see there's something picks up you see why you have to do these things your spiritual birth your natural birth types your spiritual birth praise god it is my health heavenly father we thank you lord in the name of jesus christ we come here once again father to hear receive and act on the word heal the sick we know you can do it raise the dead we know you can do it we believe it father but we're here standing on every promise of the unveiling word of god the unfailing word of promise we ask god that you bless every soul here in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated because i i want to thank the lord for the young man brother or you ambassador brother tony's son i met his daddy years ago praise the lord and we stayed together he came up my house i met him in africa matter of fact his daddy was one of them that got one of the bibles that i was talking about back there i didn't know he was here last night may god bless him and his family and uh uh his dad his dad was a good friend of ours stayed at the house praise the lord and uh so we appreciate them you know over the years there's a good that you'll be able to see young men when we went to africa years ago they were young men praise the lord and now that i tell him like me and his daddy we getting old amen but guess what gloria i was young and now i'm old but i've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread i never seen god where it failed god bless you a brother praise the lord know his name amen come down and he's a good guitar player he'll tell you he can he can really thump and get talked and praise the lord praise god and he used to come down south so praise god praise the lord now he played one of them uh we came he played like the soul get taught yeah i mean he he make it you know y'all play a little soft here but he make that get to holler so so make sure if you put him on the roster big amen thank god for him appreciate each and every one i want to talk about this morning being born at the right time being born at the right time you know i was thinking about uh google how many like google they said oh we gonna google it but let me tell you something about google google only have a lot of minds of great people that they put together and put it on a computer format are you following with me praise the lord and google can make some mistakes glory and here we are how many how many love the message and i told you that god downloaded the message in your soul how many believe that gloria when you know what you have corey you have 1100 things that you can google just in case you don't know what's going on you can google the message and god downloaded the mind of god into 1100 lessons that's a format where you can find what god want done with the praise the lord praise god i had a guy to come work on my car and i thought he was a mechanic he gets out there and he says that well let me google what's wrong i said man where the experienced guys come from i could be a google mechanic i want a man that know what he's talking about i'll let the church say this that's why guards to the man that can turn on the lights sorry and guess what that light here let you know glory that this is your time your day your message and you were born at a certain time i ain't talking about your natural birth but i'm talking about your spiritual birth glory god knew you would be here he pre-planned your birth how many things it ought to be god pre-playing your listen he pre-playing the family that you're in you may not believe that but you're not here just all of a sudden it happened no god pre-planned it you wouldn't be here this morning if god didn't want you here he pre-planned it you said somebody invited me i felt like coming where did it come from who put it inside of you where did the desire come from it had to come from god glory notice your mother and father when they came together i'm trying to say it you know for the young people you know because these young people were kind of shocked but when your mother and father came together your mother had one egg glory and that one egg are you listening your father had millions of sperms i'd say hundreds of sperms and when your mother and father came together are you listening [Applause] gloria when your mother and father came together and your father injected the sperms going into your mother all those sperms was looking for that egg do you know that not just one all those sperms was trying to find that aid that's right but some soviet grace of god some mighty power of god as they begin to go try to find an egg guess what you hit the egg the reason why you hit the egg because what god wanted you born for this time god wanted you in this time this age you say no matter whether you're a crook or saint or whatever god wanted you in this age are you listening because what he said the natural birth he was able to take that natural birth and pre-plan that natural birth where he can turn it to his spiritual birth [Applause] hurry and when you hit that egg the bad part about it is potentially you had a lot of brothers and sisters that you didn't know that didn't even come into existence when you hit the egg if they weren't twins so y'all twins you better thank god cause one of y'all would have been here that one egg about to let church say amen glory so if you're a twin you're oh god thank you for being so good to me because i couldn't have been here glory but god by his sovereign grace you hit the a and brother branham says rest of them died off why did they die because you were predestinated you were born for this time you were born for this eight and that you were born for this message you were born at the right time [Applause] i hear people hear people in a christian walk sometimes oh i had a bad life you know and what happened to me my mama left me and my daddy left me we didn't have nobody to take care of that ain't got nothing to do with your birth that's just bad things happen in life god pre-planned your birth matter of fact if you want he be playing your trials every child is a son or daughter god is predestinated predestinated trials bring you to where you're supposed to be [Music] one revival i didn't know where the rest revival started do you know right brother branson one little girl just said that i just love the lord jesus it changed the course of the entire prayer meeting what we need is people to realize that who they are where they come from why god made them there regardless of things going wrong glory you were born for a certain purpose you're born at a certain time you may find out that i want to be a fire but i want to be a doctor i want to be all that's good but you need to know what god pre-planned your birth for here going to receive this message of the hour oh don't get quiet [Applause] glory you've been pre-playing purposes not just place here this is the message of the album story let church say amen god don't want people feeling sorry for themselves oh woe is me glory but the same god that raised latter from the dead the same god that watched over the children of israel the same god that took us out of babylon and brought us into the message it's the same god here he know that you were born in this age you were born for a certain time a certain purpose and a certain year sorry listen i would find out that going to moses and his mother and father they they would leave by they was i'mma say it like this they were churchgoers they were living at a time going where things was hard the coronavirus wouldn't let them go to church wait a minute amen i got to get i got to get glory that they was under a lot of pressure [Applause] the system was under a lot of pressure the people were under a lot of pressure they would come up don't you know you know we gotta have those two pharaohs said listen this thing is getting they begin to multiply it's more glory it's more these hebrews than it is us we got to make a law gloria we got to make a law that church is not essential let church say we we can't get them to believe it just by saying we got to bring something to make sure that they that they don't catch what we're doing because guess what as long as you listen i don't care if you're drunk or alcoholic once you come to the presence of jesus christ you come to a good anointed church service glory that alcohol leave that drug lead that can't leave that worry leave everything goes away why because you're in the presence of the lord jesus christ and in him we move and have our being he transformed you boy being born at the right time moses mother and father the law went out i'm in the teaching of moses for those who follow the message moses mother and father said look you know i'm just giving it a dramatized amram you know we prayed we got a child you know the law just went out she said honey don't worry about that god said we're gonna have a child and we we ain't gonna let nobody take we're not gonna give this child up glory and after the law went out everybody now listen real good moses was born moses wasn't just the only boy born it was a lot of children born but moses mother and father had something in their mind you know what they do they knew moses was born at the right time they knew moses was born at a time when god could do something and if god do something i don't know what he's going to do but he could use my son oh let the church say amen y'all going to get mad at them we good at getting them to college we're good at getting them to get to school we're good at getting them great education but are we good at finding maybe god have a deacon in your house maybe i have a medicine in your house maybe god have somebody that's working the kingdom of god in your house go ahead get them the baptism by the holy ghost once they get the holy ghost story they'll stay with god but sometimes we don't realize we had about a house but moses mother and father they knew that the promise was coming 400 years is up god's going to do something i don't know what god is going to do but gloria pharaoh put out the put out the decrees all the firstborn firstborn kill all the firstborn not girls males kill all of them moses mother and father they weren't thinking about the corona virus they weren't thinking about the cdc they weren't thinking about what the government said they was thinking about what the word thus says the lord and and if if joshua said if it be evil to you this day choose you who you're going to serve but for me in my house we're going to serve the lord glory regardless of what the world do and all of a sudden pharaoh the decree went out all the firstborn must be killed it is a child cannot preach i think they had the effect and they messaged just like we have in ours some go along with it and some try to find a way around it oh yeah church say man i can imagine moses when moses was born his mother and father got him in there a lot of neighbors had children born know what they did uh you know they're gonna come with what's this here they come to look good see that you're going on at your house and all that kind of stuff uh i forgot what they call it now but anyway they come and check and see if that's how the child is doing at the house what they call that stuff what they call it yeah the social service pharaoh sent the social service i heard there was a child born at your house oh moses oh no we had no child you had it glory said but somebody told me are you listening somebody told me that there was a child at your house and they say y'all go to the same church [Applause] moses mother and father said i don't know what you talking about but you we got some people that lie at our church but glory oh don't get quiet they i don't have no child at the house all right they said okay they left went over so-and-so so into the house where they say god yeah i don't want to give my child but you know the law yeah the gated child up pharaoh took him fed him fed him to the alligators killed the children two months went by and somebody got jealous said she hired that boy over there they come in our house i don't have no child so i said he's over there so they sent three secret service uh uh welfare service guys over there so search the house everybody keep telling us that there is a male child in that house sorry moses mother and father had come to us so listen we know he's born at the right time i don't care what the law is saying he's born at the right time he's born to do something for god how many is born to do something for god god hey all right brothers i can't hear myself this might come straight and i never had no problem with my voice glory let church say amen amen praise god so pastor seven tell y'all to give me something so give me some value praise god i'm like brother roscoe i want to hear myself not unless i be a castaway i'm preaching to others and i can't hear myself paul didn't want to be like that god i want you to see it it means something that praise lord that's better notice and moses mother and father they would not let it go and people say he's in there they couldn't hold him no longer hit him hit him in every place they could why because they knew he was a proper child when everything was going wrong when everything was going wrong in that age at that time moses mother and father knew they had a message coming oh don't get quiet on me they knew that the message was there that god was getting ready to do something and and you know what moses could be a part of it you were here gloria when god sent elijah to do what to restore everything god knew you would be him he preparing your birth he wanted you to be in this age because a new birth would bring you to the revelation of who he is that's right glory notice moses mother and father after they've done everything they could see people take churches a little bit i just church ain't nothing but see when you know god you know god has a purpose for everything that he does that's right you might say i'm in this meeting but god have a purpose for it and they know me you might not think so but god has a purpose and a reason for do service good i don't want to scare you in that church say amen but you don't know this could be your last service you can use life is like a vapor are you listening it's here one minute is it like this gone i thought joy and me and joe we walked together yesterday we talked what happened to him so the day that you hear his voice god said the day that you hear my voice don't harden your heart in other words when you hear the word go ahead say lord yes i want to be obedient i want to follow you out because eternal life is only in one person it's not in president biden it's not in your marble not in your daddy the only one who have eternal life is jesus christ and jesus said gloria if you don't believe our heat you will die in your sins but you've got to believe that it is that he's the word glory you know moses mother and father the pressure got on him they had to figure out what they gonna do with this boy because the law was kill every child you know young male child but moses mother and father knew so listen i don't know what it is but he's born for he's born at the right time he's not born in any age he's born i'm going to take a few more but i want to get this here he's born at a time that listen god may be doing something because we know that the time for the time for the delivery to come i don't know it could be in my house hallelujah curry and so what the what she did they said couldn't go no longer the fbi or whatever the they kept coming to the house trying to say it because everybody was telling they they lost their child they didn't give them up but moses mother and father said uh-uh glory this child is a special child i ain't letting him go so finally they did all they could i could imagine i'm just drunk so oh god what are we gonna do and then look god says see that little basket right there god works in simplicity he's never changed he works in simplicity and reveal himself to say you know people get all high class looking at a great theological school bible schools going to school god don't need you out of the world you can go to a bible school and get an understanding of god god god is only revealed by revelation what you do what you go to bible school for is to learn some kind of man wisdom of god but if you want god who is god must reveal itself to you you don't learn god god reveals itself to you [Music] [Applause] how in the world can a can a a small being human being with a little peanut mind interpret the almighty god that created heaven and earth god can reveal itself to some and hide it from somebody else [Applause] paul was one of the great scholars paul at the school he had speak seven different languages i don't know why i'm going this way he speaks seven different languages and he said it came to a place paul said listen i don't know nothing glory but the lord jesus christ when he came down and he met listen he met the pillar of fire when he met that pillar fire he said who are you lord but listen he has been teaching people about god right and he actually the pulify listen he's speaking to a light that's shining down from heaven and that light is speaking to him and he's speaking back to that light you think a scholar would do that no you think an educated man will be speaking to a light out of heaven and the light says paul saul saul why you persecute me he said who are you lord that's right because he know god was in that pillar fine let me tell you something that same pillow fire the same revelation 27 that same pillow fire is leading the church today god led by the holy scope by that same pillar fire of fire by day lord and plowed by the fire by night and cloud by day the pillow fire never left the church glory unless it left the seminaries or the cemeteries but it never left the church glory the word the word and moses mother and father took that basket they looked at it and that basket became an ark they took that basket took their little baby they was in love with that baby but most of all god loved him everybody wanted to tell him i wanted to take her let let me just hold hold wait a minute somebody i just felt something listen i've been preaching 38 countries around the world so don't tell me said i don't know what i'm talking about some of y'all left your backyard i'm not being funny but i felt that spirit right glorious glory i felt that i've seen god heal the sick i seen him raise the dead praise the lord i see i've seen glory i didn't mention last night but a lady here from indiana crippled walking like drawed up my wife her name was normal she came to service and did i know she was going to be healed but one thing i do know god said lay hand on the sick that she'll recover that's all i know that's what i do god she came up and i won't say it it's frightening but i was kind of nervous she walked like you know those people have been over you know this just they can't stand up this way but the lady she came up and i know it touched god because it touched me she came up she said listen said i want prayer all i want to do is be able to stand up and cook a meal for my children at the stones if god didn't touch nobody else it touched me but it touched god she was crippled and right dead in there brother sister my wife was standing there since gandhi was there all of a sudden you can hear bones cracking do it like this right there in front she stood up praise god she was completely healed stood up and she didn't she didn't walk out the church she didn't walk out to church she ran out of the tree he thought he about four six seven years ago and when she went and i had a night service when she went home are you listening she went home she brought her brother-in-law her sister her mama her cousin about 10 people come to church that night i looked at the lord at mercy she was like the woman at the well she went down there telling everything and they couldn't deny it because here she was the one that was crippled was standing before them and never seen a lady before in my life so i went and i had to preach a conviction at another church which is about 80 miles from where she went so the pastor put out you know i've never seen i hadn't seen the lady from the time she got healed to the time i went back for two years i never no you know so anyway make a long story short we had that meeting i went to the church to have the meeting and uh and i was getting ready to preach and somebody jumped up way back in the church that's the man that prayed for me i was crippled here and god healed me and i'm telling everybody gloria said that night i made all the calls i couldn't hardly the whole church was packed up i said what in the world i'm trying to get out of here glory the whole she ain't got so mad fired up going some of y'all was there everybody in church got up for prayer i said what we need glory the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy [Applause] and you haven't you had it last night lord you that were healed just don't go around say oh i'm all right say tell somebody go in the message go tell tell somebody what god did for you [Applause] glory glory because at the end of the day god must be glorified notice go ahead and they got that basket brother they got their basket and when they got that basket they put moses in there they get ready you know to put him in the put him in the river now and wonder what god god said put a little turpin time on that's it you know and he put some turpentine sprinkled around that you know glory put moses in and i can imagine so lord please take care of my child we don't we don't want nothing to happen to him listen i can hear god say y'all took it long as you can you don't went as far as you can go now let me have it they put moses in the river and god said i need to take care of him it's a paradox but it's true anyhow god said let you know what pharaoh's daughter she don't have no children i'm gonna make her in love with this boy gloria why that's right while all of us killing babies and everything god had pharaoh daughters i'm gonna make her so in love with him even pharaoh won't even know that he ain't hers and when moses got there crying she fell so in love with moses picked him up glory why god was going to take care of him when god works for you when god is for you when god gives you a job when god gives you a company i don't care how much the boss hates you they can't do nothing until god tell them the king head is in the hand of the lord and she took moses and she loved him he was born at the right time now let me go let me go a little further let me go you know they tell me people you know winston churchill i'm in no whistle church here you used to be a we should be a prime minister for england nobody really like winston churchill he's the prime minister he used to drink all the time praise god glory even in the parliament he'd be drunk but they couldn't help but he was a part he was a he was a prime minister and one thing i liked about him glory when germany had to pin down had had england surrounded they couldn't do nothing they said well what we need to do is we got to surrender the church is no we're not surrendered we got to surrender he got everybody finally all the parliament said we're going to surrender and then churchill was kind of they they figured his judgments you know sometimes people think the past like that he makes certain judgments something wrong with him because they they know it you know glory oh don't get quiet people do that i don't know why the pastor said that i i know this but churchill said no we ain't surrendering and they said but the parliament said we were surrounded germany go take over he said he surrendered it he got up he left out the office went down and he just left before he finished that they got before he got into he got there and he wouldn't even ride the limousine they thought he was drunk so he got it so he got on a train and here's the prime minister riding the underground so he gets on the train he started and when he got on there a few people looked at him the young girl the man looked and they got up and promised he said don't worry about it glory so they wonder what's going on and then as he on the plane he actually on the train he asked a question he says shall i surrender to germany and said before we die and a lady stood up says i would never surrender i'll die for my country and the people on the plane said we'll die for our country so what happened was churchill he got playing you know rolled back got back got back to the close by where the parliament was they come into office and they said mr mr president mr prime minister what we gonna do he says uh we ain't surrendering what everybody holly actually what's wrong with you germany got he said we ain't surrendering i'm ready to die for my country and they said prime medicine why you change your mind why you change your mind you know what his answer was if you can't change your mind you can't change nothing and i say that today you can walk in as a sinner if you can't change your mind to be a christian you can't change anything that is the easiest thing you can do is change your mind that's the easiest thing this will change your mind and of course you know germany went on to win the war i mean uh england went on to win the war but you have to have somebody that's born at the right time you got to have somebody that know where they stand at the right time glory can i take someone let me take a biblical one then i'll go back goliath israel they had israel pinned down glory and everybody glides to somebody we need some man to fight us and all of us scared because you know usually the one god won't they overlook them when samuel was sent to the house of jesse to get a king they made sure that jesse that uh david didn't entertain the king they kept him out there with the sheets all that church saved me so what they did they had said uh david jesse had his oldest boy to come he had just finished school he had just oh he was a very astute vet person no god would go to he dressed right he act right he he just might he just smile what we call that uh he does my model son and when he brought him in front of glory brought him in front of samuel and he tried to take that all the way off god said i don't want it what you mean god said not him and jesse said well maybe it's the next boy i'm gonna bring out yeah he's just been getting to go to his uh he's going there let me let me i don't want to because i want nobody to think that his college but anyway he's just getting ready to go in this first year college i know don't get me wrong now okay and so he coming at the prophet coming there he got ready i believe his name was elab he got ready for his honor god said that ain't him [Music] he went down to almost all the suns and he got to a place he said he said jesse i know i got to say the lord but have you got any more sons in your house is there any more he said yeah we got one more all he do is just sing listen to the smoking word tapes [Applause] oh let me see he won't hardly get a job uh-oh he just stay in the house he said don't talk bad about it bragging and all of a sudden sam you stand there and david come in the house noah david come in the house he didn't come in all starts he'd come in oh praise god the lord is my shepherd i shall not vote though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i feel no evil lift up your heads oh ye gates and let the kingdom of glory come in who is the king of glory david said a lord mighty in battle i kill a lion and i kill a bear lord all of a sudden god samuel got anointed saying he's all glory that's him that's him get the oil pulled up why that's god's chosen god sometimes you have to add crazy cases everything else but god knows god you got good sense why because you got a spiritual attitude toward the world spiritual attitude toward the word glory david was born at the right time after you become king glory god said before you can be the king i got to see lord and the church was in a war was fighting against the philistines he was fighting uh the philistines glory david when he was too young he's about 12 years old 13. his daddy used him to go and you know take your brothers from you know how to do i get on my grandson because they'd be beating up the little one i said when i was growing up i said now y'all gonna stop this the buck gonna stop here when we were i had one brother older than me he used to beat me up then i used to beat the one down on the mediocre and we just kept trickling on down so when he got there i saw my grandson beating up his little brother outside stop it we ain't uh we having this no more that's been in my family long enough my big brother used to beat me up i used to be done we doing that no more praise god you know and i told him i said now if they beat you up you let granddaddy know only if you do something you can get me up but we should do that all the time you say you don't think you take up some family traits you do what you need is the holy ghost to get rid of those things and sometimes we think they're right i had to tell me i just fussed all the time i said again i said your mama used to fuss all the time too what that got to do with it i said you need the holy ghost and he'll control that fussing [Applause] all right the lord i don't care if you're steve whatever you get the holy ghost he changed that god has the power to transform we have bad see sometimes people get their family spirits and they think it's the holy spirit but what you need to get is the holy spirit and then you'll know god's spirit from the family spirit all right and david and david one day foxy look go go out there and take your brother something something you know they did you know they're in the war so go take up something and david got out there little did he know that was his time what he was born for was getting ready to come praise god and david he got up there he brought the food out and his brothers he's looking around his brother said go on back take care of them see your holy rollers if you would if you love god you'll be a baptist pentecostal methodist person fooling around with those old crazy people over there talking about a prophet and all this kind of stuff that's because they didn't know what a prophet was amen and david got out there and he started looking around and all of a sudden goliath show up now listen they know goliath was there but not none of them was born to take care of the liar the whole not even saul was born to take care of goliath but when david come out there he was born at the right time he was born for the acting and when he come off that goliath start boasting david said wait a minute who is this uncircumcised philistine trying to defy the army of the living god shame on him and his brother said look david you're just trying to show off you just wanted to make

grown man i don't care if he got a rifle in his head if he roy he's trying to figure out where you gonna shoot if you don't know where he coming from glory all of a sudden david he said listen he said i could kill that giant glory and he said well look you ain't but a little boy david said i kill a lion and i'll kill a bear and this uncircumcised philistine is gonna be just like one of them [Applause] in other words david said i was born for this time i was born in this message this is my day this is my hour everything that lay of the seal can bring on me i was born for this age everything that this dog ate leo the silver ain't trying to put on me i'm the bride of christ i was born for this time god predestinated me to fight in this album [Applause] and david saul said hey wait a minute let me you know you want to fight him my god because he said if any man fight him i'll do this to that davidson glory i'll fight him saul said well i'm going to try to help you so saul took off his armor which was a gallup thing took his army he was taller than anybody in the army glory you got to remember i don't care how much people can help you they only have a limit but my help and your help comes from the lord which make it heaven and earth people get tired of helping you they get frustrated they get aggravated but god don't ever get aggravated lord he don't sleep nearly slender and and the more you need him the more you call on him the more he want to help a very present help in the time of trouble and then and daniel glory put on salt armies my goodness you know it was heaviest glory and he know he was dead with that on first of all it was too heavy it's not something that a child of god go ahead you can elect church sail me say amen you get on all this here theologically got to remember these big words and stamps and stuff it kills a real son of god that's all right you ought to know god has a big word but that ain't gonna get you to god but what's gonna get you to god if you have an experience on the backside of the desert when you sat there went through trials and testing with god you know glory said like job said i know my redeemer living and though the skin worms destroyed his body yet in my flesh i'm going to see god he was absolutely sure why because he had experience with god gloria you have experience with god david had experience with god he couldn't put on solid ecclesiastical armor all he had was a slingshot praise god and without then they thought something was wrong with him but see he was born for that time they thought that something was wrong he's like i can't wear this i can't put on this can i preach i said brother branham you know you don't have a seventh grade education you're gonna preach the kings and

outlet let me say it like this all the churches is alike all of us have chicken dinners and women's script offers and script dancing and you know you know they got that praise dancing it's a bunch of prostitutes spiritual prostitutes in the church all but all the rest of the church doing that don't make no difference we ain't even talk that that's why would elijah come he was to do what to restore [Applause] are you listening when you see the world doing something the church goes differently praise god ain't got nothing to do with what side what kind of class you think you in society oh i gotta i graduated from heart i don't care a lot of devils graduated ain't got nothing to do with you when it comes to god god don't care if you ignorant and unlearned just so long as you know that he's your savior as long as you know that he's the one that's leading you and did goliath come running david took that story can you imagine a flame shot this is a slingshot he took that sling shot and he wind it up and let me just make sure you understand goliath was dressed in brass and he was about eight feet tall or more and had big helmets they had thick helmets you couldn't pierce when you hit that sword against that that brass it wouldn't hurt them hallelujah sorry what david was up against but he was born at the right time he was born for that he was born for that and david came when he got there started running toward goliath he took that there uh rock pulled up a rock out of that five smooth throw he took one of those and he spit it and when he slung that rock guess what supersonic jet got behind him amen and when he went so fast it went all the way through that piece that armor and everything knock the light right in the head in other words god put some power behind it you thank

quiet yes sir that's what he did if you don't believe it go read it's in the book she wrote the message was the most important thing to him so he took what god given to make sure that he was able to help get it out i'm just saying that god i'm talking about in other words he was born for a certain time lord notice glory are you listening like the woman at the whale she had five husbands do you believe that but jesus still come by he went by the whale he went by the well because glory he knew she was coming god ain't guessing that you have a problem god ain't guessing that you know you're just sitting here and we all we knew what god knows but when that woman comes glory jesus came they said woman give me a drink first thing she said you know i'm a baptist you're a methodist i'm a i believe in jehovah witness i'm a buddhist i'm uh she says she said i'm just dramatizing she said you know i'm a jew and you're a samaritan now she's talking to jesus and you know the jews don't have no dealings with the samaritans right oh don't get quiet over there say you know let me say it like you're i'm black and you're white since y'all don't want to listen to what i'm saying go ahead make it real you know the jews don't have no deal in other words segregation but they were talking to jesus god don't separate people it's the society that does that god doesn't do that glory we are we're all sons and daughters of god born by the holy ghost [Applause] glorious and jesus had to tell are you worried about you and the samaritan do you know who talking to you some people be sitting in church they don't know who talk that's pastor samuel do you know talking to you if you knew who was talking to you you would actually him and you would never come back to this well to draw them off if you don't talk to you can get rid of all your problems you have never had to worry about them no more and she says i'm just dramatizing you mean you come out here to well you you don't even have nothing to draw with but you said something you said something about the serpent seed in the garden of eden you said something you said that you know you have some living water i want some of that living water that i'll never have to thirst no more jesus said go call your husband she said i don't have no husband he said that's right you're right you had five husbands and you do it like the young ladies do today they do all the work and the guys stay at home and you got one man at home trying to wait on you to bring the water all right let me let me just say it let me let me just say like this i was at a gas station my wife was like there was a young man just a few years back that young man come out he's sitting there girl the guy sitting in there cutting you know and she out there pumping the gas i said you know just you know you stick christian your mind is and i said i see him i said hey how you doing like what he said fine i said you ain't pumped again he saw my lady pumping the gas [Music] he should have said i'm the lady and the man pumping the gas they take that stuff but they lost it but that's the kind of world we live in that's the kind of world we live in what's right they don't want it but what's wrong they'll take it [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and they complain about all the women taking over with me let me tell you the men gave it to him they gave them the headship glory hello hello glory stuff that they do today going my mom and daddy would never have that and some of y'all if you remember they wouldn't do it either that's right what it is we got a lot of technology a lot of information people a lot smarter and they got dumber [Applause] the bible says the fool says in his heart that there is no god he said go call your husband you have nothing to fight with just right and jesus said and it's a man waiting on you to get off work to get your money glory it says that the house it just says you have one at the house and he ain't your husband then she got religious sir i perceived it you are a prophet i know when the messiah come he gonna tell us these things jesus said i'm heating speaking to you what i got a problem my problem is i would go to church everybody have a problem about church you find anybody even in here they could be a methodist baptist with similar god when god get ready to do something new they have a problem with it god don't stand people think god stands still let me tell you the methodist church was a move of god the lutheran church was a move of god the of pentecostal apostolics was a move of god god come with the restoration to give but god didn't stay there you don't put god in the box god now god promised god revelation 10 1 the mighty age of god come down from heaven go ahead one foot on the land one for the sea cried with a loud voice a lion roared seven thunders out of their voices and since i was about to write seal it up john but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he started to breathe message the mysteries of god shall be finished listen you were born for this time is given unto you is given unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven but i just limit my giving not give it up to you glory listen gloria i like the prophet said when jesus took those two pieces of fish and bread and he fed five thousand brother mike it wasn't just ordinary bread and fish it was cooked bread 5 000 people were cooked for by the hand of god took up two pieces of fish and a piece of bread and fed 5 000 people cooked fish and bread not just bread fishing bread cooked you talking about y'all know how many stoves y'all need to keep just these little mini people here [Applause] guess what in the hand of god yes it's a paradox but it's true it happens some people like that you know that man brother bam talked about when uh he was in he was on death row because he he left the army i forgot what you called him when you leave the army yeah he deserted and his friend was very worried about him they put him in prison they put him in jail and he was going to be executed and they said president lincoln was riding on his horse and come by the man with the soldier in the army so he seen president lincoln he'd come up there he said please mr president my friend he's he's going to be executed he's going to die could you keep please give him a pardon this is a true story and so he gave him he get mr lincoln took a napkin he didn't have the president's seal or nothing because he just why not on his horse so he took a napkin he wrote on there pardon so and so so and so abraham lincoln signed it on the napkin and then god got so excited he runs to the prison shows the warden award recognizing signature got in there his friend he said listen he said you've been pardoned you've been pardoned by mr lincoln he's out leaving me alone i'm dying tomorrow i don't want to leave me alone he said but listen it's got his signature right here and the lord said you can go out now y'all i'm gonna be executed you know he said where is it he says right here the president decided leave me alone i'm gonna die he had the president pardoned the next day they executed him oh wow he got executed while he got executed in prison he says a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted he was so ignorant that he turned down the pardon that was going to give his life all that church amen and so many people are so angry to the word of god they turn down jesus christ pardon which says listen i already died for you go ahead take my name glory hallelujah and you can be saved your pardon come by jesus christ not by your education not by who you think you is [Applause] glory the only one can pardon you please forgive me for it but i'm seeing that because people don't realize they think human beings you know it's the hardest people to listen you know it's the hardest thing for one human being to listen to another and god chose the preaching of the cross wait let me report that right let me record the foolishness excuse me of preaching to save them that believes see you can believe in buddhism you know like a man said i had a i was witnessing to my personal brother one time and said you need god he was in the army and uh he's doing better now and i said i said look his name is that look you need to serve god he's on my own god i said you the sickest looking god i ever seen drunk alcohol day holy keep yourself together if you're your own god you need to step up some court hallelujah we need somebody we need a savior and god sent us to save me we needed deliverance and god's son of deliverance jesus said you don't take my life i have the power to lay it down take it up again this irish steven glory believe that i was going to get to

god [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] on that amen we're not laboring on that we're not struggling on that we're resting on that glory glory glory hallelujah glory [Music] hallelujah oh my if you want to know where i'm going [Applause] glory oh we're going to have a baptism here in a few moments [Music] where i'm going going so soon [Music] where i'm [Music] yes i'm going up beyond [Music] [Music] to be with my lord oh yes i can take the pain oh all the heartaches that they bring i've got a comfort in knowing that i'll soon be gone yes i will as god gives me grace i will run this christian [Music] hallelujah [Music] to be with my lord [Music] [Music] all the particles these days as god gives me grace [Music] oh thank [Music] [Music] i'm going in the rapture [Music] [Music] i want to read this this scripture as we are preparing for baptism this morning a man of our brother and our sister here this morning and as the scriptures as it said as peter begin to go through and under the inspiration of the holy spirit identifying what was prophecy has now been fulfilled and peter was not expressing it as a bystander or something that someone else had told him he had a personal experience and it was god speaking through him that's a difference that's why the prophet said that this message that we've received it is the flame of the hour but it must be the flame of our hearts it must be in us amen because the message is not a book or a tape the message is get under the blood the message is christ that's the real reality it's christ in you the hope of glory [Music] he said in verse 32 this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith unto himself the lord said unto my lord sit down on my right hand until i make thy foes thy footstool therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom you crucified both lord and christ identifying prophecy has been fulfilled and the holy ghost was present delivering the word and here's the effect when they heard this they knew about it but when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do maybe here gathered this morning i don't know maybe you maybe you've known about the message maybe you've known about god but it's not enough to know about god it's not good enough to be a religious person you want to know jesus christ in the power of the resurrection amen and what was spoken right here this morning was this same prophecy and the word of god that god promised in this generation that we're standing in many can point back to the cross but we're talking about what he did there he's the same lord jesus right here it's a living god that's right here among us and he comes right here among us to deal with the hearts of his children and when they heard this here became a question in their heart what must we do to be saved the word brought it it stirred something up in them and here was the answer repent repent amen conviction struck the heart you repent lord forgive me of my sins lord jesus forgive me lord i need a savior i need you not just a savior i need you lord the one who has spoke to me and pricked my heart the one who has went down and uncovered my life i need you because the same god who uncovers your life you know what he's uncovering he's uncovering every hindrance every sin everything that the devil tried to seal you in but he came comes down to break the seals begin to break away unbelief from off of your life and the same god who takes the cover everything that the enemy has come and tried to lay upon your life because he's nothing but a robber and a thief who has come to kill and destroy but jesus said i'm come that you might have life and have it more abundantly hallelujah [Music] that same god that can uncover just like as the holy spirit took it or that woman at the well that could uncover everything that was in her life you know what jesus was doing he was uncovering and lifting all the burdens and everything that the enemy had ever put upon her life but god's grace in that hour she received it that's right and the same god that uncovered now became in the life of rahab in the life of the woman at the well it became her covering it became her garment it became what she was adorned with [Music] jesus christ so if you've never repented that's the first place to start but i mean i've been raised in the message you still got to repent that's part of it [Music] that's that's the first step this is first base and this goes together be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins you know what that is it's a cutting off when you repent every thing that you have done has already been cut off you don't have to look behind you and say are those sins still there when you repent it is for the remission of sins that means there's a freedom their past sins are cut off [Music] in this same verse is the remedy to give you the strength as the holy spirit was bringing it this morning that doesn't matter how what our status is how much we know about the word or anything but now coming in the another part of this verse is now the strength to where it's not just your past sin but no longer when there becomes a new creation by the holy ghost you're no longer tied to that of the past you've been tied into the true identity of jesus christ you'd have to worry about sin no longer it's gone [Music] peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost [Music] not a perhaps not a maybe it's a certain so even as you're walking in the water of baptism here this morning maybe there's somebody else but as you walk in the waters of baptism this water could have bypassed this church and went right next door to the neighbor and they could have taken a bath in this water this water does not save nobody this water will not clean your soul [Music] it's the word of god the blood of jesus christ that cleanses your soul but this right here is a grave it's a testimony you're going down in the waters in a grave as a testimony as a witness that i have repented and i am no longer the same person remember what the holy spirit said regarding winston churchill you've got an opportunity to change your mind and that's what repentance is it means there is a change of mind a turn of heart and you're looking at your life with a real abhorrence for that sin we go down in there myself and the brother the deacon we'll lay them down here in the water and we do that by our strength we bring them up that is a sign of a clear conscience towards god now let me tell you something the same one who pricks the heart who deals with the life is the same almighty god where no man can take you then the lord jesus himself steps on the scene and he baptizes you into the holy ghost [Applause] that same god is right here this morning he's the ever-present god hallelujah how many witnesses we got here witnesses of the power of the resurrection witnesses of the holy ghost i'm a witness that jesus christ is alive and well hallelujah what an awesome decision amen what an awesome decision to serve the lord hallelujah amen i'm going to ask a word of prayer here [Music] heavenly father lord our hearts are so holy i just filled with thanksgiving lord oh god for what we are witnessing lord you doing in the grace lord that you've revealed to us that we are a part of you o god lord jesus we're not bystanders we are witnesses lord witnesses by a personal experience lord i pray oh god that as you have moved lord and arranged these services every part just
