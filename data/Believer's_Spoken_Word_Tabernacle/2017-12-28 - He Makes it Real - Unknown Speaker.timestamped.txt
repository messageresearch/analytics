[36:10] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:13] amen
[36:15] amen god bless you amen let's turn in
[36:18] the scriptures to second Corinthians
[36:19] chapter 4 now for Terry some days or
[36:43] weeks I'll be gathered together I'm glad
[36:46] that we're looking forward to a time
[36:48] where we will never depart real comfort
[36:54] that here in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4
[36:57] verse 7 Paul says but we have this
[37:02] treasure in earthen vessels that the
[37:07] excellency of the power may be of God
[37:11] and not alive well we could just stop
[37:15] there on that scripture and just just
[37:16] preach and preach and preach and preach
[37:19] when you look at how that Paul would
[37:21] declare this this treasure the treasure
[37:23] is Christ's own life and to put this
[37:27] great treasure you would think that you
[37:29] would take something of a great such
[37:31] great value in such great treasure and
[37:33] you would want to put it in something
[37:35] that would somehow be what we would look
[37:40] at this is a worthy place for this
[37:42] treasure to be placed and you know how
[37:44] it is when you go to put flowers and
[37:47] different arrangements and things like
[37:49] that you know you really don't want to
[37:50] take nice beautiful flowers and put them
[37:52] in an ugly pot is that right
[37:55] nobody well you you look at that and
[37:57] you'll say my this arrangement and I
[37:59] look at this pot but you know God has
[38:02] chosen that he would display his power
[38:06] through earthen vessels and the earth
[38:10] and that whole word that Paul would
[38:13] choose clay its frailty and you know
[38:16] we're ever so strong but in the midst of
[38:19] when tests and trials arise that goes
[38:23] beyond our ability it shows up our
[38:28] and you know what
[38:31] God loves he absolutely loves to do
[38:37] verse 8 we are troubled on every side
[38:43] yet not distressed we are perplexed but
[38:48] not in despair persecuted but not
[38:52] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[38:57] always look at this word always bearing
[39:01] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[39:06] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[39:09] be made manifest in our body so the
[39:12] manifestation of his life requires that
[39:15] death even within our body our life us
[39:20] dying it's one great death that gives us
[39:25] the opportunity to continue to die or we
[39:31] which live are always delivered unto
[39:34] death or Jesus see that the life also
[39:38] Jesus might be made manifest in our
[39:41] mortal flesh so then death worketh in US
[39:45] but life and you we having the same
[39:48] spirit of faith according as it is
[39:50] written I believed and therefore have I
[39:53] spoken we also believe and therefore
[39:55] speak knowing that he which raised up
[39:58] the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
[40:01] Jesus and shall present us with you
[40:04] for all things are for your sakes that
[40:07] the abundant grace might through the
[40:10] Thanksgiving of many redound to the
[40:13] glory of God for which cause now look at
[40:16] look how he words this year in verse 16
[40:18] for which cause we faint not so there's
[40:24] a part of us that could experience to
[40:26] where that we would within our physical
[40:29] and within our emotional part faint but
[40:33] for this cause what cause it's not for
[40:36] the trial but for what will come out of
[40:38] it
[40:39] is where we are strengthened yet we
[40:42] don't know everything that's going to
[40:44] come out of it but we know this like job
[40:46] could testify in the very beginnings
[40:48] after all this is said and done I shall
[40:51] come forth as pure as gold job was
[40:56] testifying there's parts that is going
[40:58] to be removed from me that more deity
[41:01] can display itself but though our
[41:06] outward man perish yet the inward man is
[41:10] renewed day by day
[41:13] for our light affliction which is but
[41:17] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[41:22] exceeding and eternal weight of glory
[41:25] while we look not at things which are
[41:28] seen but at the things which are not
[41:30] seen but the things which are seen are
[41:33] temporal but the things which are not
[41:34] seen are eternal amen may God richly
[41:39] bless you
[41:39] bless the reading of his word as you're
[41:41] being seated brother Branham in a
[41:46] message of total deliverance and just
[41:49] meditating upon this hold here for some
[41:52] time now bella bream says it like this
[41:55] he says we may go through lots of
[41:57] troubles and trials just remember
[42:02] there's someone who knows lights the way
[42:06] makes it real so there's someone who is
[42:13] right there who knows who's lighting the
[42:16] way so that I can move through this
[42:21] trial this trouble that has come my way
[42:24] he makes it real he makes himself real
[42:27] he makes the whole the whole part of it
[42:30] not only making himself real but in the
[42:32] midst of this time God makes that faith
[42:36] that is residing and resting within you
[42:38] which is not our own ability it's not
[42:42] our mental capacity because our mind
[42:45] could completely fail but it's a faith
[42:49] that resides within is not a meant
[42:52] but it's a supernatural thing it holds
[42:56] in the midst of all things even when our
[42:59] in our own emotional realms would waver
[43:03] with things but yet that faith that is
[43:06] of him
[43:07] it holds ever steadfast he says I do not
[43:12] know what's behind the curtain but I
[43:13] know one thing and I'm pressing towards
[43:16] the mark of the high calling every day
[43:18] trying to live for that great event that
[43:21] will take place someday when I shall see
[43:24] him face to face and tell the story
[43:26] saved by grace that's the day I live for
[43:30] leaving those things behind which are I
[43:33] want to press on and just keep going
[43:36] that's what I want to deal with tonight
[43:38] he makes it real God makes the whole the
[43:43] whole situation where his light and his
[43:46] presence he makes it real within our
[43:49] lives and you know I know that tonight
[43:51] no matter the scope that I'm speaking to
[43:54] that there are things that even in the
[43:56] midst of when you're going through a
[43:58] test or trial not just when you come out
[44:01] of a test out of a trial out of a
[44:04] situation but even in the midst of it
[44:07] there is an awareness and a supernatural
[44:09] part of it that you realize that it's
[44:12] not you that's even being able to hold
[44:15] yourself together to have this kind of
[44:18] an outlook that's it's it's just not
[44:21] there and you know I'll say it like this
[44:23] if it is within us to believe that we
[44:25] have some sort of ability to keep our
[44:28] look then that invites God to prove that
[44:31] we don't have that ability because God
[44:34] himself likes to declare that it is his
[44:37] power the excellency of it and God likes
[44:41] to show that his his power his glory but
[44:45] the only way God can do this is through
[44:48] that frailty of earthen vessels and God
[44:51] will allows you and I to come into
[44:53] situations as a matter of fact he just
[44:55] doesn't allow it he leads us into these
[44:59] situations that actually show forth the
[45:03] frailty
[45:05] the vessel there's not one of us in here
[45:09] that our vessel would be standing in
[45:11] line for a trial there's not one of you
[45:15] in here that would pray for a trial
[45:18] there's not one of you in here that
[45:20] would pray for a test not one of us
[45:23] never forget years ago and probably some
[45:25] of you remember as well brother you know
[45:27] brother jewel and brother jewel just has
[45:28] a way of saying things and brother jewel
[45:30] said you know he had a buddy a friend
[45:31] you know that saying man I'll tell you
[45:33] what I ain't had the devil ain't
[45:35] bothered me and so long he said man he
[45:37] said that guy he said he done nothing to
[45:39] me and so long he said I'd be said I'm
[45:41] just standing here saying bring it on
[45:43] brother jewel said I wouldn't be praying
[45:45] like that if I were you
[45:46] so jewel said the next thing you know he
[45:48] said that he said the devil got
[45:50] permission and he really poured it on
[45:52] that guy
[45:53] you see that's without wisdom we're not
[45:57] praying for these things but God because
[45:59] you see if it's us praying for him then
[46:01] it's us trying to tell god what to do
[46:04] but we recognize that our whole life as
[46:07] a believer is likened to that of a sheep
[46:10] and to a lamb one who is led that is
[46:12] completely not dependent in ourselves
[46:15] but dependent completely upon Almighty
[46:18] God and so when we look at this finding
[46:22] of how that God will lead us into these
[46:24] places and you look at how in this in
[46:27] Genesis chapter 22 verse 1 the Bible
[46:30] says that it came to pass after these
[46:32] things that God did tempt Abraham and
[46:35] saying to Abraham and and he said he
[46:39] behold here am I and he said take now
[46:42] thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou
[46:44] lovest and get the into the land of
[46:47] Moriah and offer him there for a burnt
[46:49] offering upon one of the mountains which
[46:51] I will tell the young and Abraham rose
[46:54] up early in the morning and saddled his
[46:56] ass and took two of his young men with
[46:58] him and Isaac his son and cleaved the
[47:01] wood for the burnt offering and rose up
[47:02] and went into the place of which God had
[47:05] told him this was not a test or a trial
[47:09] and let me just say it in this manner
[47:10] where Abraham where he was being tested
[47:13] by the surroundings of a work place or a
[47:16] surroundings of family or surrounding
[47:18] that this was not the setting and we
[47:20] understand that but this very clearly it
[47:23] was God who led Abraham into this place
[47:27] of being tested you see God's desire is
[47:31] to lead us and to bring us into these
[47:34] places of testing because remember God
[47:37] himself he's not the author of confusion
[47:40] he's not an author of frustration there
[47:43] is a purpose within it all and we
[47:46] understand that through the midst of
[47:48] every test and every trial as the author
[47:50] would inspire Peter to write it the
[47:53] fiery trial its fire that reduces and
[47:57] takes together things that are alloyed
[47:59] together and reduces it to where what
[48:02] will come forth is purity and it
[48:04] separates all the dross God has a
[48:07] purpose for every test in every trial
[48:10] and there's no way that when we can look
[48:12] at things remembering within this that
[48:14] everything is personal the Prophet uses
[48:17] these terms in the church age book he
[48:19] says it's personal temptations he talks
[48:22] about from the personal temptations he
[48:24] says and notice that each one of these
[48:26] are seasons there are seasons of
[48:29] temptations they're seasons of trying
[48:32] I'm glad for that because there is not
[48:35] one of us we are in within ourselves
[48:37] we're not even able to make it just even
[48:40] a day nor an hour nor time of trying of
[48:43] our own strength but it's God who gives
[48:45] us the strength to be able to move
[48:48] through what he has led us into and
[48:51] through the midst of it to think of it
[48:53] if there wasn't seasons there wasn't
[48:56] seasons it was one great big long
[48:59] process then you never see any
[49:01] development it's just like the seasons
[49:03] that are set forth here those seasons
[49:05] themselves are witnesses to you and I
[49:08] when we look at this now we have a
[49:10] witness that there is a springtime
[49:11] coming here's that right you know even
[49:13] in the new heavens and new earth God is
[49:15] gonna have witnesses of eternal life the
[49:17] Prophet as he said in the message future
[49:20] home he says where the Kings will bring
[49:21] the leaves and their trees will bear all
[49:24] those twelve different manners of fruits
[49:26] and he said the leaves will come in and
[49:28] brought in as a reminder to you of
[49:31] eternal life
[49:33] so God reminds these things through the
[49:35] changing if we could say of the seasons
[49:38] the fruit it's a reminder of eternal
[49:40] life and the seasons that God permits of
[49:43] testing of trying to come in our life
[49:46] and perhaps the season that you have
[49:48] just come through or you're in or you
[49:50] will go through it's not like any other
[49:51] season you've been through because not
[49:54] every season is exactly the same not
[49:57] everything is exactly the same
[49:58] entertaining the truth not every manner
[50:01] of testing and trying as far as the
[50:02] instrument or the vehicle of which is
[50:05] permitted he is always the same for each
[50:07] and every one sometimes you find others
[50:10] they're tested and they're tried within
[50:11] find answers for you you know even like
[50:14] maybe like myself that's everything with
[50:15] spreadsheets everything's at stood
[50:17] you're watching every penny you're
[50:19] watching everything like this you might
[50:20] say well how in the world this or how in
[50:22] the world death but then again remember
[50:23] here God allows everything to be tested
[50:26] sometimes it can happen with sickness it
[50:28] can happen with other things that can
[50:30] come up with family oh there's all types
[50:32] of things that can come up even to where
[50:35] the Prophet brings where there becomes
[50:37] even sometimes distress and a loss of
[50:39] joy within the church but God is testing
[50:42] to see what are you and I gonna do about
[50:45] all this hallelujah and I would say this
[50:52] right here Lord I do not want to dare to
[50:56] think that I am in a certain place and
[50:58] beyond testing but I I know that I need
[51:04] testing and I need trying
[51:07] that doesn't mean I'm inviting it I know
[51:10] that that is necessary for my growth and
[51:16] so it takes God and His infinite wisdom
[51:18] to guide us and that's a there's no
[51:20] point despawning honing in right here
[51:22] with Abraham that the Bible says that
[51:24] God did tempt Abraham and that word
[51:26] tempt is to test to try to prove and I
[51:30] love the word that's used here to assay
[51:33] so in this word it deals with that word
[51:36] of say means where there is a core
[51:39] sample that has taken from Ben
[51:41] need a surface where there's a great big
[51:43] drill that goes down and it pulls up a
[51:45] core sample and it shows what's beneath
[51:47] the surface you see everything can look
[51:50] ever so good upon the surface but it's
[51:53] one is beneath the surface and that's
[51:55] what without the testing without the
[51:57] trying what's beneath the surface
[51:59] doesn't come forth so God allows that
[52:03] drill to go down and pour out that core
[52:05] sample to determine what quality is
[52:08] there and here God lays this out with
[52:11] Abraham Abraham is at another crossroads
[52:14] and God brings him to this place he's
[52:16] brought to a place but Abraham here's
[52:19] where God is able to step in in the
[52:22] midst of this leadership is because
[52:23] Abraham even after what God has told him
[52:26] Abraham does not pull away but Abraham
[52:29] goes on the thick of this here Abraham
[52:32] knows what's going to be required he
[52:33] does not know that there's gonna be a
[52:35] ram stand there he doesn't know that he
[52:38] doesn't have that kind of a promise but
[52:40] what he has is is that God has told him
[52:42] to take his son you see if we knew all
[52:45] of this at the end of it it would no
[52:47] longer be by faith but here is by faith
[52:49] he didn't have to make that known to
[52:51] Abraham Abraham there had been such a
[52:54] tutorship
[52:55] that had taken place to her Abraham said
[52:57] had come to such a place - I can't
[53:00] explain it I don't know how it's gonna
[53:02] happen but I completely trust him and
[53:05] brother branham takes that verse of
[53:07] scripture right there and he relates
[53:09] that he said for I have received him as
[53:11] one from the dead and he said as though
[53:13] I've received him as one from the dead
[53:15] he's able to raise him back up again and
[53:17] the Prophet takes this scripture right
[53:19] here and he likens it to the quickening
[53:21] power of the new birth the same God that
[53:24] had brought before from death unto life
[53:26] is the same God that will change my
[53:29] mortal body it's trusting him trusting
[53:34] is not about understanding you see we
[53:36] believed God but Trust is where things
[53:39] don't make sense
[53:41] that's where trust comes in - think of
[53:46] how this equality all the way to the end
[53:48] let's look at another example here in
[53:50] the scriptures
[53:52] here is God coming down and fulfilling a
[53:54] promise that he's made to the fathers
[53:58] there through Abraham has been rehearsed
[54:00] and here they are in Egypt under bondage
[54:02] and God brings them out visits them and
[54:05] brings them out with a mighty hand and
[54:07] notice in verse 17 he said it came to
[54:10] pass when Pharaoh had let the people go
[54:13] that God led them not through the way of
[54:17] the land of the Philistines
[54:18] although that was near for God said less
[54:22] peradventure the people repent when they
[54:24] see war and they return to Egypt
[54:27] look at this God is mindful of what you
[54:30] and I are able to bear you know God
[54:33] could have just opened up a full thrust
[54:35] when when when he first got ahold of
[54:38] your life but God knows what you're able
[54:41] to do he's not interested in
[54:43] overthrowing faith God's not interested
[54:46] in you and I failing but God's interest
[54:50] is is that as he permits in his great
[54:53] wisdom that tester trial he knows what
[54:56] is needed at that time of our journey
[54:59] and his word by His grace moved through
[55:02] that moment then God it's building in
[55:04] our life the word is coming the word is
[55:06] shaping and molding us preparing us that
[55:09] more of his life would come forth in the
[55:12] season of God's choosing so to see this
[55:17] here just for a moment do you have the
[55:19] PowerPoint up there can you or I want
[55:21] you to I want you to see this just for a
[55:23] moment and then I'll move on if you look
[55:26] at this map here just for a moment don't
[55:28] don't don't try to study it perhaps but
[55:30] just to look at there's many things the
[55:32] point that I want to draw you to you see
[55:34] of how that God brought them around the
[55:36] way that God took them if you're I were
[55:39] you were sitting down to draw a map
[55:41] about where you're gonna go and you're
[55:43] gonna go on a trip there's no one of you
[55:46] in here would say I'll take the long way
[55:48] around now I don't know how maybe I
[55:50] better retract it because there's some
[55:51] people say I want to take the scenic
[55:53] route and I want to ask all the gas
[55:54] station attendants which way do I turn
[55:56] and but not everybody wants to take the
[55:59] scenic route you know we're interested
[56:01] in getting the fastest way there is that
[56:04] right how
[56:05] to get there fast man I want to get
[56:06] there early but near notice they took
[56:09] not God did not lead them in the way of
[56:12] the land of Philistines which is right
[56:13] along the coast this route right here
[56:16] was a heavily traveled route it was a
[56:19] route that was paved where there was
[56:21] food that was water because there was
[56:22] all types of trading posts that was
[56:25] along the way all sorts of things that
[56:27] were there but along that way along that
[56:30] way that was right there there was all
[56:32] sorts of Garrison's that were along that
[56:34] way and that's what God knew you would
[56:38] look at and say God why don't you take
[56:39] him to easy way I think is if you take
[56:41] them the easy way they don't gotta cross
[56:43] nothing you know they don't gotta cross
[56:46] they don't gotta cross the Red Sea they
[56:47] don't gotta cross the Jordan they can
[56:49] just walk right through but God has a
[56:51] way and his way is beyond what our mind
[56:55] on our natural mind would be able to
[56:58] comprehend but listen this is what I
[56:59] want to get to you and in place like
[57:01] this it's God leading can you go to the
[57:03] next slide maybe that's a little bit
[57:04] more visual for the people you can see
[57:06] this right in here how that that let
[57:08] process going right through here if they
[57:10] God did not lead them up the coast right
[57:13] here
[57:13] right into the land of Canaan but God
[57:15] chose to bring them down this way God
[57:18] shows if you go back to the scriptures
[57:21] for me he knows what we're able to bear
[57:25] the Bible says it like this in verse 18
[57:28] of Exodus 13 but God led the people
[57:31] about this wasn't this wasn't understand
[57:35] this God was leading the people Moses
[57:37] was there God was given directions and
[57:40] orders and Moses was giving that in that
[57:42] direction that leadership but remember
[57:45] where Moses as we said on Sunday Moses
[57:47] was getting gives instructions and
[57:50] directions from the very logos of God
[57:52] the pillar fire that was right there now
[57:55] to think of this God how that the people
[57:57] about through the way of the wilderness
[57:58] of the Red Sea and the children of
[58:00] Israel went up harnessed that means they
[58:02] were inland sent you know set up there
[58:04] militarily out of the land of Egypt and
[58:06] here they come into this place and God
[58:09] speaks to Moses saying speak unto the
[58:11] children Israel that they turn and in
[58:13] camp and goes through all these places
[58:15] before it shall you can't by the sea
[58:18] for favor will say of the children of
[58:21] Israel they are entangled in the land
[58:23] the wilderness has shut them in and I
[58:26] will harden Pharaoh's heart that he
[58:28] shall follow after them and I will be
[58:30] honored upon Pharaoh and a bonus all his
[58:33] hosts that the Egyptians may know that I
[58:36] am the Lord and they did so so what is
[58:39] this what if why are they going this way
[58:41] who's this about it's not about them
[58:44] this way it's not about them this way is
[58:48] about God it's love that's choosing to
[58:52] lead them this way that's why now you
[58:55] could hear that the statements of how
[58:57] that the Prophet could say many times of
[58:59] how that no doubt that the Pharaoh could
[59:01] say it led them into a death trap what a
[59:05] poor general then that Moses that their
[59:07] God is but you see God was leading but
[59:10] God was not confused this was not
[59:13] without a purpose God was leading it
[59:15] that his glory might be displayed I want
[59:19] you to look at this in the Hebrews
[59:21] series chapter three God loves to bring
[59:25] you in trouble and the church said he
[59:31] loves to put trouble down and see what
[59:34] you'll do about it
[59:36] Wow he loves to he don't begrudgingly
[59:40] he loves to put trouble down and see
[59:43] what you'll do about it
[59:44] he just stopped up the Red Sea and the
[59:46] first thing you know March them right on
[59:48] into this place then Pharaoh Martin sent
[59:51] Pharaoh after them he said you see how
[59:53] God likes to do it he loves to display
[59:56] his power and love he is God and he just
[1:00:00] loves to show you who he is hold on to
[1:00:06] that now the trouble of it is today
[1:00:08] people say all them days is past how can
[1:00:11] God display himself when you're taught
[1:00:13] such stuff as that but God loves to
[1:00:16] manifest himself here the situations
[1:00:22] that you are going through or half went
[1:00:25] through or will go through it may not be
[1:00:27] something that has the Red Sea name upon
[1:00:30] it but it is just as
[1:00:32] much as an opportunity for God to show
[1:00:35] his power and his love amen
[1:00:43] notice this in the message conference he
[1:00:45] says to whosoever will let him come and
[1:00:47] write in the line of duty you hit the
[1:00:50] blockade oh I guess all nature just
[1:00:52] quivered why look what a thing here was
[1:00:55] Moses and Israel right in the line of
[1:00:57] duty with a pillar of fire leading them
[1:01:00] and led them right down into a trap the
[1:01:05] pillar fire to purify the H of the
[1:01:09] Covenant let the people into a trap oh
[1:01:14] so my focus should not be on the trap on
[1:01:17] the trial my focus should be upon God
[1:01:22] that's the whole sum of it all is not
[1:01:25] about the trial it's about God who's
[1:01:28] guiding and directing my footsteps
[1:01:31] so the pillar fire was leading them but
[1:01:34] remember God led them into this trap but
[1:01:37] it was not a trap to consume them but it
[1:01:41] was a trap that he might display his
[1:01:44] glory Oh hallelujah glory be to God now
[1:01:49] could that be mental telepathy says
[1:01:51] notice he said notice God likes to get
[1:01:53] his people in traps and see what they'll
[1:01:55] do every son that cometh to God must
[1:01:58] first be tried and chase him let me tell
[1:02:01] you something what God when God has done
[1:02:03] I'll work with in your life where there
[1:02:06] is a union in your life as we were
[1:02:08] looking at last Thursday a real union
[1:02:10] let me tell you something there is
[1:02:12] nothing that can take you away from the
[1:02:15] presence of Almighty God there might be
[1:02:18] all sorts of winds and terror tests and
[1:02:21] storms that will come your way but there
[1:02:23] is nothing that can separate you from
[1:02:26] the love of God you say brother send me
[1:02:29] what are you talking about I'm talking
[1:02:30] about a God who can reside in a life to
[1:02:34] where people and tests and trials come
[1:02:36] they don't fall out of church and fall
[1:02:38] back in but there is a
[1:02:39] power on the inside that hopes that
[1:02:42] keeps that maintains within it cuz
[1:02:45] sendin you saying that people can't get
[1:02:47] down discourage friends I'm not saying
[1:02:48] people can't get down and discouraged
[1:02:50] but I can I'm preachin by experience if
[1:02:53] you asked me to tell you what nyquil
[1:02:55] tastes like I can't go by what you say I
[1:02:58] know what nyquil tastes like because
[1:03:00] I've had it and I know the keeping power
[1:03:03] of the Holy Ghost cuz I've got it and
[1:03:06] he's kept me time and time again you see
[1:03:10] what I'm saying
[1:03:11] weekend you can't you can't talk things
[1:03:13] by well I know this quote and I know
[1:03:15] that do you know it by experience you
[1:03:18] gotta know God by experience and then
[1:03:21] we're not talking about things about you
[1:03:24] know what we've read or what we know
[1:03:25] that's all knowledge it matters about
[1:03:27] experience and experience comes forth
[1:03:30] through testings through trials through
[1:03:32] situations
[1:03:34] absolutely I don't think you have much
[1:03:39] stock if every time I felt down and
[1:03:41] discouraged I said you know what I ain't
[1:03:43] gonna be there tonight just send
[1:03:45] somebody else in I'm too downed tonight
[1:03:48] I'll tell you what if you had enough
[1:03:50] respect for God's Word you'd say you
[1:03:52] know what I find somebody else to come
[1:03:54] to me when I've got a time of need come
[1:03:57] on somebody we're talking about a God
[1:04:00] who keeps a God who establishes we're
[1:04:04] talking about one who is there that when
[1:04:06] we're going through the midst of
[1:04:07] something and all right there's one like
[1:04:09] David said in my distress I called unto
[1:04:13] the Lord and I said lead me to the rock
[1:04:16] that is higher than I david was emitting
[1:04:19] the situation is beyond me david said
[1:04:22] when my heart is overwhelmed
[1:04:26] leave me to the rock that's where I need
[1:04:29] to go to the resource hallelujah oh ma
[1:04:36] sure we get down sure I'll as the
[1:04:38] scripture said the outward man perish
[1:04:40] but friends let me tell you something
[1:04:42] there is an anchor that must be there
[1:04:44] within the soul that there is a love
[1:04:46] affair that when things are not going
[1:04:48] the way that we think they ought to go
[1:04:50] or what we've expected it to go that we
[1:04:53] say Lord in the midst of it all I trust
[1:04:55] you I trust you Lord God will send you
[1:05:01] in that faith in a way he trusts is
[1:05:04] faith but trust is greater because faith
[1:05:06] itself trust is not in that are the same
[1:05:09] but trust itself is where you cannot
[1:05:12] explain what's going on
[1:05:17] we don't serve God like that anyhow but
[1:05:21] trust is where we said Lord I have just
[1:05:23] committed to you I don't know how this
[1:05:24] is going to come out I don't know how
[1:05:26] it's good because you know what Lord I'm
[1:05:27] right now I'm just cancelling my order
[1:05:29] of brick I'm cancelling my order I'm not
[1:05:31] gonna build no more bridges come on now
[1:05:36] you know how Lowe's pulls up in your
[1:05:38] yard get the nice get the nice you know
[1:05:40] a will or Al than they and where would
[1:05:42] you like this load deposited but you
[1:05:45] know tonight you can just say Lord I
[1:05:46] surrender all the bridge-building take
[1:05:50] all the two by fours and all the framing
[1:05:52] and all the cement I cancelled the order
[1:05:58] but tell me you don't need a bridge no I
[1:06:00] just need a way through it
[1:06:02] I need Hill who lives the way to make
[1:06:05] the way through it he gets them to
[1:06:09] notice every Sun that cometh to God must
[1:06:11] first be tried and chasing he gets them
[1:06:14] there he brings you here he puts you in
[1:06:16] between opinions now could that be
[1:06:19] mineral at empathy telepathy could it be
[1:06:21] he'd put you in a trap to see what kind
[1:06:23] of a decision you're going
[1:06:25] to make the brand says search to go
[1:06:27] ahead and search the Scriptures they are
[1:06:29] they that testify of me think of this
[1:06:31] time right here
[1:06:32] Moses Syria's in the midst of this
[1:06:34] journey and he comes out and he speaks
[1:06:36] he prophesized in the midst of this time
[1:06:39] the presence of God is there right there
[1:06:42] because God's never departed he's right
[1:06:44] there in a camp to address the need in
[1:06:46] the situation and God moves upon Moses
[1:06:49] and Moses prophesized to them that they
[1:06:53] should not fear but stand still and see
[1:06:55] the salvation of the Lord and then
[1:06:58] immediately the very next verse how that
[1:07:02] Moses himself forgets his commission are
[1:07:06] you it you know the Prophet tells us
[1:07:09] that he forgot his commission you say
[1:07:11] well how did he forget his commission
[1:07:13] because the Commission is not just with
[1:07:15] one little certain angle in it the
[1:07:17] Commission is all encompassing what it
[1:07:21] is is that every obstacle that would
[1:07:23] come throughout the way God has said
[1:07:26] that I have come down to deliver them
[1:07:28] out of Egypt and bring them into the
[1:07:30] land of promise when God was making that
[1:07:33] known right there and commissioned Moses
[1:07:35] he had commissioned him that no matter
[1:07:37] what obstacles come out the Commission
[1:07:40] remains the same let me tell you
[1:07:42] something when you have been
[1:07:43] commissioned by the Holy Ghost himself
[1:07:46] it does not matter what tests what
[1:07:48] trials what obstacles come your way you
[1:07:50] don't matter how down you feel how low
[1:07:54] you feel you have been commissioned and
[1:07:56] you are commissioned to speak and go
[1:07:59] forward come on friends this is my
[1:08:02] workshop this is a living reality you
[1:08:05] have been commissioned by Almighty God
[1:08:07] and God comes down and he makes it known
[1:08:10] to Moses he's forgot his commission he
[1:08:13] forgot the authority that he had been
[1:08:15] given let me tell you you have been
[1:08:17] given authority when you have been
[1:08:20] filled with the Holy Ghost you have been
[1:08:23] given authority from on high Oh
[1:08:26] behind you when you stand with that word
[1:08:29] and you confess that word
[1:08:31] you stand there own that all of Heaven
[1:08:33] is behind that word because it's not
[1:08:36] your word it's God's words well Sammy
[1:08:45] I'll just think about how about say it
[1:08:47] he didn't say if you think to this
[1:08:49] mountain come on somebody if you think
[1:08:52] to this mountain but he said if you say
[1:08:55] to this mountain we're better salmon you
[1:08:57] got to think first you gotta let his
[1:09:00] mind be in you I absolutely agree let
[1:09:03] his mind be in you that he is the same
[1:09:05] God yesterday today and forever the same
[1:09:09] God that delivered my soul is the same
[1:09:11] God that delivers me in the midst of my
[1:09:14] afflictions how that God allowed Israel
[1:09:33] to see this great work you know that is
[1:09:35] just God's mercy
[1:09:39] he's already brought him out of Egypt he
[1:09:42] delivered him from the greatest nation
[1:09:45] on the earth that's what the Spirit of
[1:09:50] God had Moses to recall their attention
[1:09:53] to when has this been done before that a
[1:09:55] nation was delivered from a nation he's
[1:09:59] causing them to what consider the
[1:10:02] impossibilities you realize that in the
[1:10:04] book of Deuteronomy God takes even
[1:10:06] people who are not of the inheritance
[1:10:09] and he would remind him even those of he
[1:10:11] saw that had thought Giants of the land
[1:10:13] that they ran from before and God
[1:10:15] delivered him the horns all of those
[1:10:17] imps there wasn't this Israel one the
[1:10:20] only one that's seen Giants Diana comes
[1:10:23] were not the only Giants they were one
[1:10:25] of the many but there were others who
[1:10:28] were not even of the Covenant promise
[1:10:30] but they smoked Giants in there
[1:10:33] and God let Israel know hey these are
[1:10:36] people that are don't even have the
[1:10:37] inheritance of me behind them but they
[1:10:40] took what was theirs and drove them out
[1:10:44] how much greater what God on our side
[1:10:48] the riveters do surrendered to him how
[1:10:51] much greater God would be able you say
[1:10:56] oh brother Samuel these people they were
[1:10:58] organized people they had the ability
[1:11:00] with great armies and great sword you're
[1:11:02] going back to reasoning again you're
[1:11:05] going back to this was a man's strength
[1:11:06] this is not how the word is fulfilled by
[1:11:09] the strength of man but God allowed
[1:11:11] situations like that to be that he could
[1:11:13] prove and say look you want to see
[1:11:15] things these are not things that's
[1:11:17] impossible you know God can allow you to
[1:11:20] hear a testimony of somebody that don't
[1:11:21] even believe this message you can God
[1:11:23] allow you to hear a testimony of
[1:11:25] somebody you know I'm saying they don't
[1:11:26] even know what you and I know and God
[1:11:28] can allow even a testimony of somebody
[1:11:30] who don't even who don't even claim to
[1:11:32] serve God and it might be a concerning a
[1:11:34] surgery or whatever more and why would
[1:11:37] God allow that to happen for you God
[1:11:43] will allow that word to come across your
[1:11:45] way to do what encouraged you to over to
[1:11:53] be tagged on do you see friends we are
[1:11:54] people of truth think of this here it
[1:11:59] would have been easier if we look at it
[1:12:02] the natural way it would have been
[1:12:03] easier for God to take him up the way of
[1:12:05] the Philistines because all he had to do
[1:12:07] was wipe out a few of the legions he
[1:12:10] just destroyed the most powerful nation
[1:12:12] on the earth wiped out their army but
[1:12:16] God has a way God wanted to let them
[1:12:20] know I'm not only a general but I am
[1:12:24] your father
[1:12:25] I am your provider I am the one who
[1:12:28] keeps the clothing on your back
[1:12:31] Laurie I am the one who supplies for you
[1:12:35] when I brought you out of Egypt I was
[1:12:37] not without the thinking that you were
[1:12:39] going to need something to eat
[1:12:40] you're gonna need something to drink
[1:12:41] I've already provided that along the way
[1:12:44] God was letting them know everything to
[1:12:49] you oh that you have everything to you
[1:12:55] that's why your friends the greatest
[1:12:57] mistake that we can make is when we feel
[1:12:59] like that there are areas and parts of
[1:13:01] our life that somehow or another that we
[1:13:04] can oversee oh brother Samuel this in
[1:13:08] very spiritual I don't think I need to
[1:13:10] pray whether I should buy this car or
[1:13:12] buy this house or buy that I just think
[1:13:14] you know you've got to be able to know
[1:13:15] this right here you can take that mental
[1:13:17] frame of thought if you want to but I
[1:13:19] believe it's all in my heart that God's
[1:13:21] desire is to be over every area of our
[1:13:23] life and I just think he desires that
[1:13:25] that's my desire I want to know he's not
[1:13:28] about whether I can have something I
[1:13:30] want to know is this what you would have
[1:13:33] for me why because in every situation
[1:13:36] and in everything we are going to be
[1:13:40] tested and trial just because God makes
[1:13:43] known his will doesn't mean that it's
[1:13:44] going to be easy when God makes known
[1:13:48] his will for you to go
[1:13:49] it means them and means quite the
[1:13:51] opposite that you're gonna be tested and
[1:13:53] you're gonna be tried but him revealing
[1:13:54] his will is what gives you strength to
[1:13:57] look to him for deliverance in every
[1:13:59] situation he could have let him by the
[1:14:04] way of a fell Philistine but he chose
[1:14:06] not to do it that way so when we look at
[1:14:09] this here the scriptures in Matthew 6
[1:14:12] verse 9 notice this scripture here I
[1:14:18] found it interesting a few weeks ago
[1:14:20] might have been a month ago or so by now
[1:14:21] I think was only some weeks ago as soon
[1:14:23] as I got out of a certain Thursday night
[1:14:25] service somebody sends me a text about
[1:14:26] this at this very portion of scripture
[1:14:29] that the Pope himself wants to change he
[1:14:33] doesn't like this portion of Scripture
[1:14:35] in him and a lot of the bishops and a
[1:14:36] lot of the lot of the Roman Catholics do
[1:14:39] think that somehow this is entirely
[1:14:41] wrong but we're
[1:14:42] reiden I'm not reading it because of
[1:14:43] that it's just because of what he's led
[1:14:45] down for tonight after this manner
[1:14:48] therefore pray this about prayer our
[1:14:50] Father which art in heaven hallowed be
[1:14:53] thy name
[1:14:54] back kingdom come Thy will be done on
[1:14:58] earth as it is in heaven give us this
[1:15:00] day our daily bread and forgive us our
[1:15:04] debts as we forgive our debtors and lead
[1:15:07] us not into temptation this is what they
[1:15:11] want to get rid of and lead us not into
[1:15:14] temptation why would God godwyn lead
[1:15:16] anybody to temptation but he you got to
[1:15:18] understand the word temptation and we've
[1:15:21] already seen just two examples of how
[1:15:22] God leadeth come on somebody
[1:15:26] here's prayer and lead us not into
[1:15:29] temptation but deliver us from evil for
[1:15:33] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:15:35] the glory forever amen delivering us
[1:15:39] from all evil brother Brennan it says it
[1:15:40] like this I don't have it down but he
[1:15:42] refers to that part delivering us from
[1:15:44] all evil all unbelief all sickness all
[1:15:47] diseases all afflictions all super
[1:15:49] systems everything deliver us from evil
[1:15:51] he says deliver us from the evil of
[1:15:53] sickness deliver deliver us from the
[1:15:55] evil of depressed deliver from all evil
[1:16:01] this is how you to pray lead us not into
[1:16:06] temptation so as a believer now here we
[1:16:11] do we have this instruction our
[1:16:13] instruction is not Lord send a trial my
[1:16:16] way Lord send to test my way are you
[1:16:19] thinking you're big enough to handle it
[1:16:20] and you ain't even big enough to handle
[1:16:23] them when they come your way and you're
[1:16:24] not asking for him lead us not into
[1:16:30] temptation what's what to speak of
[1:16:33] weakness not weakness in within
[1:16:35] ourselves as far as sons and daughters
[1:16:37] of God that part that Zoey life that is
[1:16:40] inside the soul but weakness lead us not
[1:16:43] into temptation
[1:16:47] this word temptation is that experiment
[1:16:49] that attempt at trial that proving the
[1:16:52] trial of man's fidelity the faithfulness
[1:16:54] the integrity the virtue
[1:16:55] the constancy adversity affliction
[1:16:58] trouble sent by God and serving to test
[1:17:02] or prove one's character faith and
[1:17:05] holiness I want you to kick this into
[1:17:07] mind here lead us not into temptation he
[1:17:11] didn't say
[1:17:12] begging God God please don't say no
[1:17:13] trans Ord please don't send no trial
[1:17:15] know what I can't take nothing else
[1:17:16] right now nor that's that's not what
[1:17:18] he's saying but this this prayer this is
[1:17:20] the very part of our life because it
[1:17:22] this this life this prayer lead us not
[1:17:24] into temptation is not a prayer to dodge
[1:17:26] it this is not the prayer the prayer is
[1:17:29] not to dodge it but the prayer is lead
[1:17:32] us not in temptation showing that within
[1:17:35] ourselves we there is that weakness
[1:17:37] within ourself but our dependency is on
[1:17:39] his complete oversight that he leads us
[1:17:44] into those things and if he leads us
[1:17:47] there he's there with us where he led
[1:17:52] Israel to he was there where he led
[1:17:56] Abraham to he was there and I'd say I
[1:18:04] praise God for that I just want to say
[1:18:06] thank you lord thank you Lord Jesus
[1:18:10] there's three kinds of believers brother
[1:18:12] Branham he talks of it like this
[1:18:14] concerning the very trying and trial of
[1:18:17] the Lord Jesus himself and he says
[1:18:19] notice he says you've got something to
[1:18:22] do God's got something for you to do you
[1:18:26] may have some heartaches and some
[1:18:29] troubles and you may have some
[1:18:31] disappointments but do we pray to shun
[1:18:34] them no now notice how he broke this up
[1:18:38] with the testings and trials there are
[1:18:40] troubles there's disappointments I'm not
[1:18:43] going to ask you to raise your hands
[1:18:44] that every one of us has been
[1:18:45] disappointed you know brother Branham
[1:18:50] says it in prayer Lord you've broken my
[1:18:54] heart over and over again but I love you
[1:19:05] told him no do we pray to shun it we've
[1:19:12] had heartaches
[1:19:14] we have hardens their troubles
[1:19:17] we have disappointments but do we pray
[1:19:22] to shun them I didn't put this word on
[1:19:24] there but I have it right here before me
[1:19:26] but you I think we pretty much know what
[1:19:28] Sun means shun means to persistently
[1:19:31] avoid you know how you won't go down
[1:19:35] certain roads or certain things you
[1:19:37] avoid it
[1:19:38] it isn't like oh yeah I just bypassed
[1:19:41] that road now sometimes we do that oh I
[1:19:45] just bypass my exit but this is talking
[1:19:47] about knowingly persistently avoiding to
[1:19:53] ignore something to reject it so we
[1:19:58] don't pray to shun it notice the prayer
[1:19:59] the prayer lead us not into temptation
[1:20:01] is not Lord let me avoid but I don't
[1:20:05] want nothing to do with any test or any
[1:20:06] trial but lord please leave me not into
[1:20:10] temptation
[1:20:14] notice how the Prophet finishes this up
[1:20:17] he says Lord take me through them
[1:20:21] whatever they is whatever it is don't
[1:20:25] let me escape them if they're set for me
[1:20:31] just give me grace to go through that
[1:20:34] that's all
[1:20:37] so don't remove I'm not praying for
[1:20:40] tests and trials to be removed but give
[1:20:42] me the grace to go through it now let's
[1:20:48] look at this just hone it in just a
[1:20:50] little bit more into our sacrifice here
[1:20:54] stands the perfect Lamb of God his life
[1:21:01] upon earth
[1:21:02] he knows his purpose in knowing listen
[1:21:06] now in knowing who he is walking in a
[1:21:10] world of perfect faith he knows his
[1:21:12] purpose here after one of the greatest
[1:21:16] men great miracle has taken place in
[1:21:19] Matthew 16:21
[1:21:21] the scripture says from that time forth
[1:21:23] began Jesus to show unto his disciples
[1:21:25] how that he must go into Jerusalem and
[1:21:28] suffer many things of the elders and
[1:21:30] chief priests and scribes and be killed
[1:21:32] and be raised again the third day he
[1:21:35] began to show them these things he knows
[1:21:38] his purpose then Peter took him and
[1:21:42] began to rebuke him saying being far
[1:21:45] from the Lord this shall not be unto
[1:21:48] thee now that's love but it's not love
[1:21:55] in the same level that God has for him
[1:21:57] he's not reflecting that love yet
[1:22:00] because he hasn't received that love yet
[1:22:02] but he's only reflecting the level of
[1:22:04] love that he knows and he what he's
[1:22:06] doing is he's trying to preserve trying
[1:22:09] to hold back
[1:22:10] now notice Peter if you had asked Peter
[1:22:11] just at this moment if we could pause
[1:22:13] for a minute Peter what are you doing
[1:22:15] well I'm helping him out he don't need
[1:22:18] to go up there we need to safeguard him
[1:22:21] he don't need to go anywhere around
[1:22:23] Jerusalem he said this that then we know
[1:22:25] they don't like him up there
[1:22:29] but you see Peter there's an influence
[1:22:33] and the Lord Jesus deserves the
[1:22:36] influence but he turned and said unto
[1:22:39] Peter get thee behind me Satan
[1:22:43] thou Satan aren't an offense unto me for
[1:22:48] thou Satan savourest not the things that
[1:22:51] be of God but those that be of man so he
[1:22:56] was able to separate luck job
[1:22:58] remember when Joel his wife spoke and
[1:23:00] said why don't you just give up and
[1:23:01] curse God and die
[1:23:02] Jim didn't say you speak you're a
[1:23:04] foolish woman he said you speak like a
[1:23:08] foolish woman
[1:23:12] so this discernment this offense thou
[1:23:17] art an offence to me this this offence
[1:23:20] the same word that's used like that of a
[1:23:22] stumbling block it's the word scandal a
[1:23:25] trap of snare any impediment placed in
[1:23:28] the way causing one to stumble or fall
[1:23:30] the Lord Jesus would not even allow that
[1:23:33] to remain there you know he could have
[1:23:35] walked on he could have walked on but he
[1:23:39] saw fit to address that spirit I will
[1:23:42] not allow that to have any residency why
[1:23:48] this is against the purpose that God has
[1:23:51] called me for I'll tell you what when
[1:23:53] the devil raises his voice against the
[1:23:55] purpose that God has called you for
[1:23:57] you've got authority to stand there and
[1:23:59] say get behind me Satan if there's
[1:24:03] anything that raises up against that
[1:24:05] purpose no matter what it is friends
[1:24:07] you've got an authority just stand there
[1:24:09] as a matter of fact not just having
[1:24:10] authority you've got a mandate by God to
[1:24:13] stand there and say get behind me Satan
[1:24:17] remember you don't have to rail against
[1:24:19] him you don't have to pronounce and give
[1:24:21] him lines of judgment the Bible said
[1:24:23] that God didn't even when Michael was
[1:24:25] disputing concerning the body of Moses
[1:24:27] he did not bring railing accusation your
[1:24:29] judgment is coming you know it the
[1:24:31] sentence will be read over you in the
[1:24:33] meantime get behind me
[1:24:35] I don't need to recite to you all of the
[1:24:39] Scriptures about your judgment
[1:24:41] you know and I'm telling you get behind
[1:24:44] me I know sometimes you might be in the
[1:24:50] middle of the shopping mall or the
[1:24:52] shopping part and you might feel like
[1:24:53] lord have mercy what if I do this out
[1:24:55] here Security's going to be around on me
[1:24:56] you can say it right there you can say
[1:25:00] it right there here might be just
[1:25:02] something you've formed with your lips
[1:25:03] because remember it's not Satan hearing
[1:25:05] the veracity of your words he's hearing
[1:25:08] the faith pulsation of your heart and
[1:25:11] what is that faith that he is my I am
[1:25:16] his child you know that trust is
[1:25:20] communicated that faith is communicated
[1:25:25] Jesus is getting rid of any impediment
[1:25:27] Oh was this impediment this impediment
[1:25:31] was siding with you don't need to go you
[1:25:37] don't need to go this was siding with
[1:25:39] him you know sometimes friend we need
[1:25:42] encouragement from one another yeah
[1:25:45] right but at the same time we don't need
[1:25:48] siding with as far as life can you move
[1:25:51] over I'll get down in the hole with you
[1:25:53] you got enough extra shovel I'll
[1:25:55] help you dig you understand I'm saying I
[1:25:57] know sometimes that I've looked at they
[1:25:59] listen friends I'm just telling you from
[1:26:00] me
[1:26:01] I don't preach on you obvious preach on
[1:26:02] me sometimes I've thought about when
[1:26:04] things have said and enquiries I'm
[1:26:05] encouragement maybe it comes in and you
[1:26:07] know I could sit there and think well I
[1:26:08] don't know what I'm going through
[1:26:10] they don't know what I'm facing I could
[1:26:11] I can dwell on that those thoughts can
[1:26:13] come to me friends and they do come I
[1:26:16] can dwell on that or I can say Lord you
[1:26:20] laid it on their heart to sin that you
[1:26:23] had them say that Lord God they could
[1:26:25] have went on by they could have passed
[1:26:26] us on by but you had him say that or you
[1:26:28] had this be done or this or this or drop
[1:26:31] this my way I can do that your
[1:26:33] understand friends that God it's not
[1:26:35] about God wanting to come down and make
[1:26:37] the hole bigger for us he wants to make
[1:26:40] himself known and take us through
[1:26:46] there's difference we can have
[1:26:48] compassion without having sympathy
[1:26:50] because sometimes when we get into a
[1:26:52] place of such sympathy we get into such
[1:26:54] a place that the person that we're
[1:26:56] trying to help they they come out of
[1:26:57] there and you step on their head and get
[1:26:59] on up out of the hole because they've
[1:27:00] all the holes already went bigger while
[1:27:02] you been in there but the same time only
[1:27:05] speak in fact some facts you need to
[1:27:07] keep your mouth closed
[1:27:09] because God is greater than all things
[1:27:14] [Applause]
[1:27:15] somebody's brought it up to me little
[1:27:17] while ago years ago when I preach the
[1:27:19] whole series of messages when the truth
[1:27:21] is not the truth the truth was there
[1:27:26] were giants in the land but that wasn't
[1:27:28] the truth the truth is I have given you
[1:27:32] the land you've got a balanced truth
[1:27:36] with the truth glory be to God this is
[1:27:41] greater than Ripley's Believe It or Not
[1:27:45] here's the Lord Jesus here stands the
[1:27:50] Lord Jesus look what he's looking as
[1:27:52] he's in verse 38 my soul is exceeding
[1:27:55] sorrowful even unto death terror you
[1:28:01] hear and watch with me he went a little
[1:28:03] further fell on his face and prayed
[1:28:05] saying O my father if it be possible now
[1:28:08] watch this if it be possible let this
[1:28:10] cup this trial this test this temptation
[1:28:16] let it pass from me if it's possible
[1:28:21] nevertheless not as I will but as thou
[1:28:28] his will was let it pass but he
[1:28:34] surrendered his will you see he could
[1:28:39] not go here being drugged he had to be
[1:28:44] led
[1:28:46] God doesn't drag us into trials he leads
[1:28:51] he leads
[1:28:53] he didn't drag him out of Egypt no he
[1:28:57] didn't lead him to that place by the Red
[1:28:58] Sea or dragging he let him he didn't
[1:29:00] drag Abraham up to mama rocky Letty now
[1:29:09] you know as it goes on here when Jesus
[1:29:11] says he comes and he sees him he says
[1:29:13] watch and pray that you enter not into
[1:29:15] temptation the spirit indeed is willing
[1:29:17] but the flesh is weak his own flesh was
[1:29:22] weak you know brother Bram so so in many
[1:29:27] places but they were looking over one
[1:29:29] place for the RAM says he knew what
[1:29:32] awaited him he knew the lacerations that
[1:29:34] would open up and bones would be there
[1:29:37] he knew of all of the suffering that
[1:29:43] would come his way it doesn't say here
[1:29:48] now is my soul joyous my soul is sorry
[1:29:55] even on to death was a time of departing
[1:30:00] now watch this like Abraham at this very
[1:30:04] moment right here
[1:30:05] there is no strings on him this is not
[1:30:08] an act
[1:30:09] he's not a puppet he could have went and
[1:30:13] hid he could have fled to another
[1:30:16] country he could have done that
[1:30:23] but he remained faithful unto the end
[1:30:29] his love kept ting their love for what
[1:30:33] his love for the word his love for the
[1:30:37] father his love for the father was brett
[1:30:40] has been projected to you and me it was
[1:30:42] that love he could have fled there was
[1:30:45] no Springs on him but he surrendered his
[1:30:49] rights to be led nevertheless not my
[1:30:55] will vine will be done three times not
[1:31:01] once three times you say don't don't let
[1:31:05] the devil call you when you're praying
[1:31:07] about something don't let the devil get
[1:31:08] on your back well you must be it
[1:31:09] you must be faithless because you're
[1:31:11] asking God no no right here
[1:31:13] he prayed three times this was not an
[1:31:17] act
[1:31:17] he prayed three times if it's possible
[1:31:19] let this cup pass from me
[1:31:21] he wasn't praying to shun it he wasn't
[1:31:28] praying to shun it but he surrendered
[1:31:31] his will to the will there's a greater
[1:31:36] counsel at work here this is where the
[1:31:40] scripture could pick up and say that he
[1:31:42] was led as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:31:46] he was led as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:31:49] like a lamb dumb before his Shearer he
[1:31:51] opened not his mouth you know the
[1:31:53] scripture says in isaiah 53:7 look at
[1:31:56] what it speaks of you and i he was
[1:31:58] oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened
[1:32:00] not his mouth
[1:32:00] he was brought as a lamb to the
[1:32:02] slaughter as a sheep before her
[1:32:05] Shearer's he's done this is the measure
[1:32:12] of suffering that Paul could speak of
[1:32:14] that is left to us as the Church of the
[1:32:17] Living God this measure of suffering so
[1:32:21] he opened not his mouth
[1:32:22] sheering it's shaving off I think a lot
[1:32:26] of us we know a lot of that we
[1:32:27] understand that but you know that that
[1:32:30] shearing off of that wool is very
[1:32:31] important there's a season for it
[1:32:34] they don't do it all the time but that
[1:32:37] wool is something it's not something
[1:32:39] that it's just it comes out it's not
[1:32:42] something we have to try to manufacture
[1:32:44] it just comes out but it gets to a time
[1:32:47] to where that there's a season that that
[1:32:50] wool needs to be removed and I don't I
[1:32:54] don't know if you've ever watched it
[1:32:55] I've watched it countless hours of
[1:32:57] things when I've studied on sheep over
[1:32:59] the years and looking at so many
[1:33:00] different things especially in other
[1:33:02] countries they still are still such a
[1:33:04] great even high occupation of this
[1:33:06] there's going in some of this things
[1:33:08] with the shearing there's sometimes
[1:33:09] Nick's cuts and everything else that
[1:33:13] comes but the shearing is to remove the
[1:33:16] wool because in that wool there can also
[1:33:20] be a buildup of parasites and it's
[1:33:24] necessary to be sheared down but the
[1:33:29] shearing down is such a great thing that
[1:33:31] they they don't even want to give the
[1:33:33] the sheep you can't let him eat as a
[1:33:37] matter of fact before you're gonna share
[1:33:38] him they want him cleaned they said
[1:33:41] don't you have dirty sheep when a
[1:33:43] Shearer comes to sheer it's got to be
[1:33:45] clean if you know it's gonna rain keep
[1:33:49] them in the barn so the door everything
[1:33:51] doesn't get matted and in an amazing how
[1:33:53] God and he's washing us by the law of
[1:33:58] the word what's he doing getting us
[1:34:00] ready for shearing he's getting us ready
[1:34:03] to be sheared we're land we're not
[1:34:08] forced
[1:34:08] we're not drugged we're led you know
[1:34:11] this is where that in the midst of it
[1:34:13] let me just let me just let me finish
[1:34:15] this point up here Paul said and I've we
[1:34:18] spoke to this here before Paul said in
[1:34:21] verse 10 of Philippians 3 that I may
[1:34:23] know him and the power of his
[1:34:25] resurrection not just that my soul has
[1:34:30] been raised from death unto life and as
[1:34:31] we looked at last week these opening
[1:34:34] scriptures that we read right here it's
[1:34:37] a dying a test or a trial that comes
[1:34:40] it's a dying to self but God's grace
[1:34:44] raised
[1:34:47] from the test from the trial we can say
[1:34:53] Lord if it was not for your grace that
[1:34:55] has raised me up as Paul said he had
[1:34:58] delivered us from so great a death he
[1:34:59] does deliver us and he will deliver us
[1:35:03] because the trying is what it's a dying
[1:35:06] what that the life of Christ might be
[1:35:10] made manifest if he had not went to
[1:35:13] count remember it was Almighty God who
[1:35:18] led the lamb the Calvary led him to
[1:35:23] Calvary aren't you glad he went aren't
[1:35:26] you glad he was led to that place if he
[1:35:29] had not been led to that place in
[1:35:30] obedience we would not enjoy the life
[1:35:32] that we have the night in him but he was
[1:35:38] led to that place and to think of how
[1:35:41] that Paul would say in the power of his
[1:35:43] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[1:35:45] sufferings being made conformable unto
[1:35:48] his death being made conformable unto
[1:35:52] his death the Fellowship of his
[1:35:54] suffering I want you to think of this
[1:35:56] here tonight we understand that
[1:35:59] character itself you have an invitation
[1:36:04] to have your character mobile and that
[1:36:06] invitation is that call of the gospel
[1:36:08] that brings you and I through all of
[1:36:11] those processes into that of the new
[1:36:13] birth then by that new birth that life
[1:36:17] event is the character of life in us
[1:36:19] then our character is molded is being
[1:36:24] shamed and listen to me character we
[1:36:28] understand this statement is very clear
[1:36:30] what a tremendous statement it's not a
[1:36:33] gift nobody can give it to us I hope you
[1:36:38] understand this Jesus Christ Himself
[1:36:40] cannot give you character he can't give
[1:36:46] but he will bring forth his character in
[1:36:51] shaping earth because it's not what he's
[1:36:54] already given us eternal life and by the
[1:36:57] character of life within us is what
[1:36:59] molds our character so character is not
[1:37:02] a gift it's a victory if character is a
[1:37:05] victory that means there's battles
[1:37:08] there's opposition's there's tests that
[1:37:10] comes character is not given through
[1:37:13] preaching and teaching but character is
[1:37:20] necessary
[1:37:22] how so where does the ministering of the
[1:37:25] work where does that come in as Paul
[1:37:27] said that we all come to the unity of
[1:37:29] the faith and the knowledge of the Son
[1:37:32] of God and that we come into the full
[1:37:35] measure of the stature of Christ we grow
[1:37:39] up in him so what does the word doing
[1:37:41] the word God is teaching us he's
[1:37:44] admonishing us he's showing us this
[1:37:47] himself is leadership in the word and
[1:37:51] what does it do our understanding being
[1:37:53] opened then we submit to that and God
[1:37:57] will mold our character taking that word
[1:38:00] and bringing forth through experiences
[1:38:04] you see that's why yes it's important
[1:38:07] the Word of God is so important word is
[1:38:10] just the presence of God the minister
[1:38:13] Lord is so important but as the brother
[1:38:15] Ram tells us that knowledge of the Son
[1:38:16] of God is where he said we can come into
[1:38:18] certain things and we say I don't
[1:38:20] understand this I don't understand that
[1:38:22] he said but if you sit down with it and
[1:38:23] just say Lord I don't understand it will
[1:38:26] you remedy it all together then then he
[1:38:29] said that's Holy Ghost knowledge but we
[1:38:32] need that understanding of the word and
[1:38:34] God has his way of communicating that so
[1:38:38] it's just like this we can leave out of
[1:38:40] here we have understanding in our life
[1:38:42] and here we can leave right out of here
[1:38:43] tonight understanding has come and we
[1:38:45] come face to face what in the world's
[1:38:47] going on you see but in the midst of all
[1:38:51] of a sudden your mind can come back it's
[1:38:55] not our mind over matter
[1:38:58] but the word is there and we say Lord
[1:39:01] let your word be formed in my life that
[1:39:07] word is the truth I give myself to you
[1:39:10] mould me shape me make me Lord in the
[1:39:14] midst of this time as you're leading me
[1:39:17] lead me through what is to be brought
[1:39:21] out of my life
[1:39:22] let it be Archie I'm glad to know that
[1:39:25] he's in control glad to know that he's
[1:39:29] over all the works at his hands and
[1:39:32] they're wonderful hey man you love him
[1:39:35] tonight
[1:39:47] anyone want to be remembered in prayer
[1:39:49] tonight as we go in prayer let's pray
[1:39:56] let's all pray together Lord Jesus
[1:40:00] we're just here tonight Lord is Lord of
[1:40:04] a family Lord a part of that great
[1:40:08] family of God Lord Jesus we're so
[1:40:14] grateful Lord tonight Lord you would
[1:40:16] speak to us Lord concerning these things
[1:40:20] Lord in our life Lord truly you come
[1:40:26] Lord to encourage us to strengthen us
[1:40:28] Lord you come Lord Father to direct us
[1:40:32] Lloyd your father I pray tonight that
[1:40:36] Lord behind each and every every hand
[1:40:39] nor the hearts Lord that are lifted up
[1:40:41] with for you your God I pray that you
[1:40:44] administer Lord to each one grant to
[1:40:48] them Lord God what they have need of
[1:40:51] Lord I pour my hand my heart is up with
[1:40:55] Lord as your prophet said there's times
[1:40:57] Lord in troubles we have disappointments
[1:41:01] things sometimes Lord don't go the way
[1:41:04] that we're thinking they're gonna go
[1:41:05] we have heartaches Lord but father we
[1:41:08] know that within it all that it's not
[1:41:11] Satan overriding you he can't do one
[1:41:14] thing unless he gets permission from
[1:41:16] so Lord we can see in your word that
[1:41:19] you're God how that you led the children
[1:41:22] of Israel how you let Abraham Lord God
[1:41:25] time would felassan all these examples
[1:41:27] but you've let your children in the
[1:41:30] midst of these times that father through
[1:41:33] the midst of it you might make yourself
[1:41:34] known
[1:41:36] Lord God within each and every one of
[1:41:38] our hearts Lord in our journey and our
[1:41:40] walk with you Lord you never intended
[1:41:43] Lord that our walk would be easy Lord as
[1:41:46] far as no tests and no trials but during
[1:41:50] the midst of it dear God you said and
[1:41:52] you promised and we have Lord God that
[1:41:55] testimony you have never forsaken us you
[1:42:00] are faithful Lord you are with us or God
[1:42:04] guiding us and directing us lord help us
[1:42:07] Lord with this northern understanding
[1:42:09] that's come Lord we want to submit Lord
[1:42:11] God ourselves Lord to the Word of God
[1:42:15] just asking Lord that that word will
[1:42:18] just takes such a hole in our lives Lord
[1:42:20] I pray the Lord in the midst of Lord
[1:42:25] suffering as your prophet led us into
[1:42:27] that he said this is where character is
[1:42:30] me is through something or I don't
[1:42:33] believe in any way then Lord that that
[1:42:37] we have to walk down and discourage I
[1:42:40] don't believe that that's what God that
[1:42:43] you would desire out of our lives for
[1:42:45] suffering yet we could Lord God and we
[1:42:50] all have been there may be some tonight
[1:42:52] Lord
[1:42:53] maybe there's a condition there's a
[1:42:55] situation in the life Lord but father
[1:42:58] they're looking to you tonight and deep
[1:43:00] within Lord beyond all of the
[1:43:03] disappointments and the feelings of
[1:43:05] their spirit in their body deep within
[1:43:07] Lord they have that blessed assurance
[1:43:09] that I know that the Lord will deliver
[1:43:12] me he's seeing me through him guide me
[1:43:16] through all this huh
[1:43:16] I can't see I can't I can't make sense
[1:43:19] of all this but my trust is in Oh father
[1:43:24] I pray tonight Lord granted Lord Jesus
[1:43:28] by way of your word your Holy Spirit
[1:43:30] taking that word Lord to our hearts Lord
[1:43:33] God we want you Lord to have the right
[1:43:36] away guide us Lord strengthen us each
[1:43:39] and every one more father our desire is
[1:43:42] to bring glory to your name Lord and
[1:43:44] help us Lord in the midst of it all Lord
[1:43:47] that God may our trust continue to grow
[1:43:50] greater and greater Lord in you Lord we
[1:43:53] love you and we praise you today thank
[1:43:56] you Lord for the tests and the trials
[1:43:59] that God that you permitted to come our
[1:44:01] way his true Lord as the scripture said
[1:44:05] we have prayed and we still pray lead us
[1:44:08] not into temptation Lord God we stand
[1:44:11] there Lord just as the Son of God
[1:44:15] Himself would pray let this cup pass
[1:44:18] from me Lord there's been many tests
[1:44:21] there's been many trials there had been
[1:44:23] many there's been many Lord of sickness
[1:44:25] and different things Lord that that we
[1:44:28] have I've asked I've asked that he would
[1:44:30] pass and I would want it to pass in a
[1:44:32] certain way hard father dear God
[1:44:38] you have given grace that is sufficient
[1:44:43] Lord each time and that's what we want
[1:44:46] to praise you for it
[1:44:48] forgive us Lord for when we have tried
[1:44:50] to form or direct you and tell you Lord
[1:44:54] what needs to be done or how there's but
[1:44:56] God we know Lord that you are over your
[1:45:01] over our lives you're guiding us you're
[1:45:03] directing us Lord all that you ask of us
[1:45:06] is just to be yielded to you and you
[1:45:09] make yourself known to us as all
[1:45:11] sufficiency nor do we love you
[1:45:15] you make it real to us Lord and we want
[1:45:19] to say that we love you from
[1:45:21] no wonder Paul could say I am persuaded
[1:45:24] that neither height nor depth nor
[1:45:26] creature nor Angels the power and the
[1:45:29] principalities nothing shall be able to
[1:45:33] separate us from the love God we have in
[1:45:38] Christ that love oh god how we think
[1:45:42] what a relationship what a union Lord
[1:45:48] bless your people Lord up
