appreciate all y'all being here and stuff you know we we think the different ones that that do things from time to time but I just want to thank the Lord for each of you you're pulling in your desire to serve the Lord of this this assembly just always been a real blessing to me and you're each just your real special people and I've been different places throughout the world not trying to sound well-traveled because I'm not some guru or something but it's just always a real pleasure real godly spirit here and we just love you thank you for the opportunity to be here with you again this morning appreciate your pastor as well who's out and about and pray the Lord watch over him as he's traveling and there's a if you have your Bibles here Matthew chapter 14 I'll try not to wax poetic but we'll get straight into the scripture here and we're gonna look in the 22nd verse this morning Matthew chapter 14 verse 22 and the scripture says this is straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and then the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid verse 28 and Peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water I like that got a little backbone there said hey that's Jesus let's do something about it if he's here hey man we're gonna drown anyway but if he's here I might as well walk on the water I like that and he said come and when Peter was come out come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus praise the Lord verse 27 I want to read this once more but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and I like to take that as a thought this morning it as I be not afraid and believing that he is here with us just as well why don't we just bow our heads for a word of Prayer this morning our gracious father we are so thankful today Lord to be able to read your word Lord what lesson is to just live in a country where we are able to have a Bible and to read it and to be literate and Lord just having travel different places I know what that means it's just a real blessing to even be able to to read the scripture known that the the Catholic Church throughout history has tried to stop the people and even put it in the language they couldn't read it and so Lord it's just such a great thing to even be able to read the pages of this Bible this morning but what a greater thing it is to us Lord to be aware that the very author of this word the scripture the same one is here with us present lor we're not reading about a historical God but you were the present help in the time of trouble you are the great I am NOT I was not I will be but you are right now here with us in your present Lord I don't believe that this words of this prayers our hearts have joined together then they would fall to the ground but Lord that you would hear our cries and attending to our prayer Lord Father for me this morning I for my own sake Lord as I was saying to the people I I just even the sickness in my body and the weariness Lord I'm a witness in times past it's you were able to to move that completely silence it doesn't have to be a hindrance to the service and Lord whatever condition whatever situation whatever difficulty that we have entered into this place with his a body of believers this morning I believe that you could just take all doubt and dissolve it Lord you could take all sickness and make it well father you could take darkness and give us a light for darkness look if there be a spirit of heaviness I pray you give us a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness can you break every chain and every yoke all oppression all darkness Lord you did not ordained for us to be a people bound by the things of this world but she'd given us a great Liberty to stand fast and low we take our positions this morning as believers we lift our voice and we confess our great power and Liberty in Jesus Christ then we are free to worship you we are free to magnifier we are free to live out his sons and daughters of God Lord I pray you just come in a mighty way speak to the people Lord may you magnify and get great glory unto your name and unto yourself in this place father for I believe you have ordained us to worship you in spirit and in truth father have your way we pray we commit all these things our lives our hearts our souls into your faithful hands as a loving and a faithful creator and we ask all these things when you bless the word now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and I mean god bless these are seated it is I be not afraid brother branham preaches a sermon attest to me on the sea preaches the same thought be not afraid different titles I think at least that I could count at least 16 different times maybe more in the message and so I just take a quote from one of these this morning brother ran when he preaches about this usually takes a great length to talk about the testimonies that they were sharing and we are familiar with many of these testimonies but I thought well they seen somebody come walking on the water walking up amen he ever been in that place before it looks like all hope was gone amen listen you can feel that way there they were in darkness in despair and they thought their lives were forfeit but they seen somebody walking up and brother Adam says something quite remarkable here this isn't the thing the sad part he says listen close the only thing that could help them they was afraid of it they said look spirit II it might be you know a spirit if that hasn't happened again they're afraid of it they're afraid of fortune telling they're afraid of some kind of a devil power when Jesus said it would happen in this day amen I want you understand this message and what God has done this age it wasn't some sort of a plan B for God this wasn't something that God just kind of threw it at the end you know like when you go buy a car they will throw in an air freshener with it or something like that this isn't something I just kind of threw in there but this is that was prophesied by the Prophet Malachi this is that which was spoken of Luke 1730 revelations 10 7 this was foretold by the men of old but they were moogly Speight the Holy Ghost this was supposed to happen the way happen and yet the people don't recognize and they're afraid of the very thing God told would come to pass amen the Prophet says this they're afraid is some kind of a devil power jesus said it would happen in this day the only thing that can help them is Jesus Christ not another denomination not all of them joining together that's just going to make it worse than ever the only thing that can help you is Jesus Christ when they promised to return the last days in this form to do this promising just like before the promised son returned to Abraham the first seed the royal seed of Abraham Jesus he said you would see the same thing amen get this off here now before the promised son God will manifest himself in flesh and do exactly like Jesus did like he said he would do just like would be done the last days and here all those promises we could just lay them out by dozens right here before you that is supposed to take place amen I want you just think about even for yourself the promises you like God promised that he would provide for you God promised to be a healer for you he promised all these things I don't want you to think that's strange we get to a place sometimes believers God does something like wow I can't live God did that and I'm thinking you're the believer you're supposed to believe that but why do we make it like these things were done in the corner we've got tape after tape of God doing something supernatural names and places and times and miracles things a man can't do things you can't do and we sit there like we're shocked he said it was supposed to take place we shouldn't you know it's against the the people they marvel is somebody coming in one time here a while back and I was preaching about something I mentioned certain testimony said brother I just marvel that that took place and I said I'm marvel that's you marvel and then it's not me say we're supposed to believe these things it's supposed to be in our life every day I'm not saying that as a rebuke I'm not coming down when I'm saying we can believe for more we can believe for something greater because it was foretold for this day that's people amen not just his prophet his people would do exploits who's he talking about his talk by you when you recognize him not you're the one you're the one that's called to it amen well you should feel good about her I feel good about it I'm happy amen it's like predestination some people don't like predestination I like predestination cuz I'm predestinated I'm okay with it if you're not I understand why you get upset but look I'm the predestinated and then well I feel good about any man where's the Lord he says this he says the churches which ought to be with arms out to receive it well I'm a little afraid of that it doesn't belong to our group see and they're a scared of it that's the Kentucky English they're for you they're a scared of it the only thing that can bring them to Christ is Christ himself and unless I can't do it free you can't never he can do it he's the only one and they're afraid of that it's scary oh I don't know that might be spirited you seen I don't know about the scared of the only thing that can help them and watch what he says but in that our that lifted Church that group sitting out there scared the elected were scared of it scared that a lobby sweet they didn't want to have nothing to go ahead listen they weren't looking for him to come he come to them they didn't want nothing to do with it then come that sweet voice be not afraid in his eyes again brother Ram says in 1963 says Jesus come walking to them on the water they got scared said it's spooky we'd better not know that meeting anymore it's funny they seen him return again in his power just as he promised through the pages of these Bible of these pages of this Bible rather that he would do this in the last days and that walked in a minute that people say oh that's just mental telepathy that's spiritualism that's some kind of a see that's the same thing and the only thing that will save I'll just sort of really lay this in this one because sometimes I think we we think a program or an idea or our own all I listen to tapes I do that that's all good that's fine but that don't save you listen I know a guy and he lists the tapes every day and he's in jail for four I don't want to tell you what he's in jail for amen listen there's got to be a connection somewhere with the one that's speaking and many times as I was preaching about just last and many times we try to substitute it with our own idea or all works well I did this and I didn't do this and I stopped this that's good that's fine but there's got to be something great and behind it it's gotta be who's doing it who's saying it who's speaking it's not you listen if I come to you on the water first why would i'd be paddling this hey man I'm not even a great swimmer I mean you'd be like what sit down hey man listen the reason to not be afraid is not because of me or a deacon or a passion it's because it's Jesus Christ that's the reason amen here's a little listen you've got you might have listen Oh hallelujah well praise the Lord I got four kids some of y'all got kids some of you may be getting ready to have kids over and I go too far with that Amen you know how does your lady to see him people say you know what I don't even know why somebody want to raise kids in this day and age it's so dark it's oh my god people say that to me why you having all them kids oh I love it the people that have more kids than me tell me why do you have four kids it's easily people with like six or seven well you got so many kids don't you know how bad it is I understand how bad it is I'm not allowed into it I can look at a newspaper I can look out the window but I am also convinced that we have received the greatest message that's ever struck the face of the earth and where sin abounds grace knows much more about I believe the guns preacher token message to us to the mouth of a prophet for this day it wasn't for another region with the token is for the end time there's a reason for it so you can take your children take your family and not have to live in fear well you can say I believe others are keeping power and the literal lack of Jesus Christ for me for my wife for my family for my loved ones you can look at a thousand circumstances and be afraid but you've got one good reason this morning not to be afraid he's here and that one reason is greater than the thousand reasons to be afraid you can look at sickness you can look at on paint mills if you look at church issues if you look at all kinds of confusion and you can look the devil straight in the eye and say I don't have to be afraid because he is here Jesus is here in gravy's he wears the Aggies lapis in the mornings a new boat song to me that's what I'm just a good saying he's here made the difference he's done things in my life I could not do I know it wasn't me I couldn't I couldn't overcome addiction I couldn't overcome a temper like a bust I couldn't overcome these things it was Jesus Jesus on the inside looking toward the outside well Holly and I appreciate that by the way hey there all of them were scared they meant all of us caring the credit what is this we don't know it looks scary look spooky what happened right in that crucial moment there come a voice fear not it is I be not afraid Amen now I want you to understand they're not afraid of the idea of Jesus actually they were talking about the head multiplied the loaves they've seen the sick healed they seen the dead raised by eyes on the idea of a historical Jesus did not frighten them now they have a historical Jesus doesn't frighten most people and then because you can make a historical Jesus whatever you want you got your progressive liberal hippie Jesus you got your staunch conservative Jesus and he always votes Republican and you've got your your Jesus set that wants you to not pay taxes and your yeah people can invent a Jesus for what out you don't saying look we're going to Christmas and they've got Jesus in a manger as a little baby well that's not where he's at today and then that was where he was it's not where he is but he's in this Ranger he's in this dwelling place today and that's not where he's not he's not on the cross anymore like in the good old Catholic Church they got him hanging on the lawn across he don't need the cross today he's done with the cross the cross is finished the cross is for you and I he suited the right-handed lorry far about all principality and all power and all might know Dominion amen they loved the idea of a of a historical Jesus and we can we can we can puppet him and say what we want nobody's afraid of that kinda Jesus but when he comes in a different form and listen he's not doing something different he's doing exactly what he's always done he's speaking exactly what he's always spoken nothing has changed except the form of him but because it doesn't line up with our idea because they can't control that kind of Jesus we can't make that Jesus say what we want we can't make an excuse whatever kind of thing we've got in our life that we want to get away with and then they're afraid of it and yeah that's the only listen to the church kids listen the church can't save you and then I would love to say I can save you but I can't do it amen but I believe the one who can he's here the same one that saved you the same one that filled with the Holy Ghost he's the same one here today then be whatever your need is here comes Jesus the same God the same part of the same life here by his Spirit it offends people that's that's the big world I'm a friend and I'm like why do I care well I'm offended and this offends me and this person over here is offended by my bye-bye Jesus and I'm thinking whoa unto them that are that offend one of his little one's amen well worried about offending the wrong people we get so even as believers well I don't want to offend my coworker and I don't want to offend this person I don't want to offend Jesus that's the one I want to make sure I don't offend him I'm not talking about getting everybody's face and trying to tear them down that's not what I'm getting please don't misinterpret that I'm saying she go punch somebody in the face because they don't believe what you believe I know some people like that that ain't no better amen but what I'm saying is who we've got to be mindful is the one that's on the water because he's the one that's gonna save you when your boats getting tossed to and fro by the storms of life we're all hell's moving through your life and sickness strikes and darkness comes and you can't find a way out and you as a believer an elected believer find that you're losing hope don't get quiet on me listen some of y'all always got the victory I love preach these sermons and some people like I've always praise God I wish that was you but I ain't always got a bit well I do I just don't think I do hey man we've all got victory that's our victories all right thanks but sometimes they don't seem like we got the victory I mean you discouraged don't act like get all a bunch of robots here we never have discouragement this night I get discouraged and that's not ten years ago that's probably before I come out here so you start singing I'd be discouraged I look at things I leave the circumstances and then we all do listen what we're taught to do that I'm gonna help myself here a little bit we're taught to do that firmly only time of life hey man we look at these things were saying well I can't can it be amen but I'm so thankful because Jesus when he come in this there he comes just like he did that in a man when God comes when Jesus comes praise God he's not silent he not have been one thing they saw him coming I said what's that he didn't say nothing but he speaks when he comes and when there's a voice of God in this age and spoken to us many people look at a prophets ministry they look at the message they question is this a man's idea is it a cult is it some sort of a fanaticism but we've heard a voice it was the same watch let's pump in the middle that see that night it was Jesus Christ and don't be afraid it's I this message is more than trip doctrine it's more than just entertainment it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today well and when you recognize who it is let us come to you you have no reason to be afraid they can calm every storm he can dissolve every that he can overcome every adversary there's nothing greater oh my thank God hey man this left your own devices we wouldn't know hey man we think we've got it all figured out you don't know nothing except what he's done told you and then what isn't what you know about God is what he's declared in his word he didn't have to do that but he chose to do that he revealed him somewhere in simplicity why cuz he wants you to get it hope you catch that now he's not trying to hide it from you here's a believer he's trying to come here he wants you to know he know what you look at him on the stand so I don't know what this is and it's a bunch of finale when is it now he's spoken to you cuz he doesn't want you to be afraid he give him one reason out of a thousand reasons to be afraid to give me one reason not to me and that one reason is it greater than every reason to disbelieve it's greater than every reason to be fearful it's everything it's greater than every reason to want to turn back and say what should we do and and all these other things amen he comes and he comes and he's not silent amen but he speaks to take fear away from you a man and that's why I'm concerned I preached this out of this thought and this is this is why I feel so strongly about this my concern is a minister and as a dad as I get older as our young people they're taught to be afraid of the moving of the Holy Ghost say men are old people they're taught to be afraid of the moving of the Holy Ghost we've seen these things they're on tape you can listen to it and yet you get around some people and they're just so afraid well I'm afraid that God might might give some people a little excited we don't want to say Amen - uh-huh we go on the stage Allah I say praise God I like it listen I don't know whether you realize this or not this is the quietest place you're ever gonna live this you don't like it loud here you're not gonna like it up there well hallelujah praise the Lord people that are being taught to be afraid I want to read this quote from the questions and answers I want you to think about this and it's really meditating on a moment what the prophets saying here he says oh if that great holy church maybe you're familiar with this this is if that great holy church only realized its power to do these things and I not talking about something out there it's all about something here you know we say these things like speaking of world in existence and missing limbs being restored he's not talking about something out there on the other side of the Sea of Galilee you come out where you're at in your storm of life right here today well you're both being tossed that's where he's at if you only realize the power in the church to do these things but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright amen he says this when every talk of fear is vanished hey man now this isn't quite a thing because we talk about fear or every talk of fear vanishing we we do it subconsciously so often amen we're like I said we were trained almost to talk in a way of fearfulness from an early age and what I want you to understand is when every talk of that disappears amen because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks when fear is gone he says this whenever talk of fears vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and the church has power so notice if you are lying fear to have preeminence or make decisions for you then you're not letting the Holy Spirit do it because God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power of Dunamis ability of power love and a sound mind amen so it's either one or the oh praise the Lord he's a see why they have everything that heaven owns behind them who's that you can raise your hand this is participation now you get points with their have everything that heaven heaven has behind them that's you why is there ambassadors of the throne absolutely an ambassador Christ has the authority and everything that Christ owns belongs to that ambassador and he said go you into all the world ye are my witnesses after that the Holy Ghost is come on you what is a witness he says it's an ambassador to come and to witness something the whole powers of heaven is right in your hands let me ask the question why do we set and the church is burned and we sit Dorna it's because we don't recognize these things amen I want you to saying we're called to be a witness of it amen now I'm not gonna get into the recent events of the week in the politics and things but you get these guys on the stand and they say well I heard a guy say that he heard a guy say this guy did that's not a witness that's hearsay amen and my concern is a lot of people in church and a lot of preachers they preach here say what about what God has done I heard about the Holy Ghost I've heard about these things somebody told me one time about a certain guy that just shook the guy's hand that knew brother Branham but do you know Jesus have you met the same one listen you can't get one by painted fire have you met the same raucous man now you're a witness you've seen it firsthand you're a witness of it amen well I didn't put this on my notes but I was talked about this years ago I said you're in the witness protection program God's got a witness protection program hey man we've been really putting this witness protection program they change your name they change your identity they change where you live and then all the protector testimonies eliteness listen God change who you are he changed your name they caught the bride he's chained where you live they're not the same person you speak your identity has been changed you're a witness like I said we learn in our lives to make decisions based on fear we teach art shop of it there's a natural side of that a man I don't encourage my children to play in the street with the ball by face and I'm not saying to be funny but some people go the other way with it amen I'm not encouraging recklessness for the sake of being reckless hey man listen there it makes sense a man there's a natural side of things you teach your children not to play with fire don't don't play in traffic amen we teach them from an early age to be afraid of the consequences thing but the problem is is we get older we we experience disappointment so we go through difficulties and we it kind of rejection and we we learn fear hey man we learn the fear of death and the fear of pain the fear of loneliness the fear of rejection we avoid danger we observe the law and alley now we go to church and we put on an act in front of everybody because we fear the consequences of being ostracized amen and some people that's how they live their life and I want you understand if that's all the farther you've come you're living in fear you're missing what the kingdoms about many Christians live in fear those other Christians are not I'm not D Christianizing people even many Christians they live daily with fear they make decisions based on fear they operate in fear and you're missing what the kingdom is really about because that's not what the kingdoms about if the kingdom is here Jesus is here you don't have to be afraid hey man well praise the Lord Paul Paul quotes a Greek poet so I'm gonna quote Shakespeare here son intelligent I'm not but years ago I was in school we read Julius Caesar had to read was required reading but I was reading Julius Caesar and I do actually like to play Julius Caesar I and Julius Caesar when he finds out he's gonna be killed on the Ides of March he said something remarkable it's always stuck with me my life throughout my life and maybe you're familiar of this but Caesar says this he says cowards die many times before their deaths but a hero only tastes of death but once and then and I think that's a I was a remarkable it's a powerful statement to think about the gravity of it cowards die many times before their deaths and then when you live in fear and you're constantly living in the state of fear you're you're not really living you actually experience things the consequences of death dead you're afraid of dying yeah that's what you're doing but you're not dying in the South you're dying after the things of God you're missing what the kingdoms about but a man with courage a man that's bold a man with such a man mr. Newman in the upper room they were missing out on the kingdom but when the Holy Ghost come on their fear was gone let's have boldness they come out they're staggered like drunkards and then they got a little backbone in them praise the Lord listen the wicked flees with no man pursues but the righteous are as bold as a lion why do you have bonus because you know who's with you [Applause] you know I've often heard preachers they preached about the you know I was a younger brother and I had a big brother well I was the big brother I'm the oldest of my siblings so I was the brother if somebody picked on my little brother I'll go get him hey man I was that guy so I can't I can't preach from that perspective too much but I do know somebody picked on my little brother I'd be mad I'm gonna stick out phone cuz that's what you do right you're any big brother your kid is that right how much more you are Jesus amen listen if he's with you you don't have to be afraid not because you're so big and tougher because you're so smart it's who's with you you know he's with you because he's declared that's what the message is about so you don't have to guess was he with me is anyone maybe as many as you know he's here because he said it I said how do you know he's in the church building this morning not because that the building is special not because you painted a certain way put a cross in the wall you know he's here that's how you know he's here and if you know that he's here you know that all things are possible amen praise the Lord you look at the borderline believer you look in the days of the Exodus they come up through the wilderness Israel come through the wilderness and they didn't pass over and why do they fail to take the land they were afraid of Giants I mean they had ten back sling preachers they come in there preaching their false doctrine well there's Giants and there's this and that what were they preaching fear amen now listen every blessing was right across the way it wasn't far away every blessing was there but they were being preached fear well you don't love God you don't you know you want all this stuff in our church we don't want all this moving of the Holy Ghost and there's all this fanaticism people that preaching we got to be worried about fanaticism hey man and they get to a place where they're afraid we're the parents they're afraid to teach your children about the message listen you look at the laws of some of these countries nowadays the parents our friends our children but shouldn't have more power than the parents they're afraid of the consequences of raising a child the right way see they live in fear it's all based on fear is that right now parents are afraid to take their children teach them the truth amen well I'll have somebody else do it maybe the government or maybe the teacher I want the pastor to raise my children for me if you're a parent your job to raise your own children and then a job to tell them the truth then it's your job to teach them it's not somebody else's job we want everybody else to do all the work well I might mess up well I got this and I'm not capable amen well praise the Lord you know I think about society no I think about all the dumb things I did this young man because somebody dared me or egged me on you know how young men are while they're testosterones law more elevated than when you're in your 30s man they're trying to impress a girl to try and do something w every kind of crazy stuff every kind of stupid thing I did things like that hey man you've got young men this message they'll do all kinds of stupid stuff but no run with the crowd but they're afraid to take a stand for the Lord and then what is greater is that right we ought not to be afraid well praise the Lord brother Branham says this he said God hates a coward didn't someone he didn't have got hating anybody God hates a coward he said love casts out fear it says if you've got love you don't have any fear I'll let that one sink in there for a second if you've got love you don't have any fear there's nothing fear all this is powerful fear doesn't have one bit of value about it now many of you for that quote before many stuff well I'll just be honest with you let's show hands again how many in here as an adult as a Christian has ever worried about something many hands going up everywhere how many in here ready for this how many in here was glad afterwards that they worried about it I thought I do that church one time ever seems like let me repeat that I think you missed it and then we do this all the time listen I was laying in bed last night thinking about hardly gonna do something in the house whatever well I just lost that much more sleep that didn't help me and then listen we we sit there and we wring our hands we pull her hair we get great hair we get wrinkles we worry about stuff all the time there's not one bit of value to it you never get up the next is a boy blessed God I'm so glad I worried about that I'm so glad I lost sleep over oh praise the Lord I just love stressing out oh praise God I'm so glad I'm friend they never do that and yeah we do it I remember what I want you say you don't have to live that way disabled in that way for years you don't have to stay that way Jesus is here why are we taking thought for the morrow sufficient for today as the evil thereof but you put first the king of God and His righteousness it adds all these other things here we were in little Hills out of our mountains earth I may be said that backwards ma any more holes in the mines amen we're looking five years out here this or projected planning our 401ks gonna crash it and one of my job and I'm up by this and makar I'm a job in my house and we're we're worried about the stuff and half the time you don't even come to pass so the devil still in your time time that belongs our God Tom Long's you don't have to live in fear fear don't have one bit of value about it there's not one thing he says it'll hinder you you say well now what if you're gonna be shot in the morning once you'd be scared no sir fear couldn't help me fear could only make me worse boy I hope somebody takes that home with them tell me Lord fear can only make you worse well what could faith do for you if you're hurting sign this you're gonna die on faith consign my pardon amen he says again in conferences I hate a coward so God does too shoot he says a man that's afraid this is good I like it here a man that's afraid after he's been healed to testify about it a man that God has saved and he's ashamed to tell somebody he saved and filled with the Holy Ghost I haven't got much confidence in his salvation shoot but when you really get it you want to tell everybody you just can't keep still oh my I think about when I first got the holy up maybe you've heard this story before I apologize I'm gonna tell again when I first got this is just this is just you know I was a 23 year old man at the time when I first got the Holy Ghost I went to work I was working in the restaurant and I went to work I started testifying my buddy at work and this is not about the Holy Ghost of the Paragon and the boss he comes up and he says uh you can go home early today how much oh well I was really hoping to stay over and no no no you go I don't know why I was trying to work over now it would be like shoot praise God he said know what you go home early and I realized what it was about and I go home and I was kind of scared so I go back to my roommate and he was a believer he is a believer but I was talking to him I said yeah I got sent home from work early today and he's like well praise the Lord like what do you mean it's like we just got persecuted I said yeah I did didn't I yeah oh and now I'm not trying to be funny but it's the way you look at it I was like man but I just couldn't keep still I had to tell somebody I still feel that way today I swam up here doing what I do I'm gonna tell somebody this Holy Ghost that filling them people in the book of Acts that Holy Ghost are coming the promise meetings I know as a witness he did the same thing for me what heard voices around this message tell me it's not so it's not expected nomination I expect that from the girl Catholic Church but my concern is our people our children God's children are being taught well it's not so we just have a cream read a Dogma you just believe God sent a prophet the devil believes that God sent a prophet who wouldn't shake the fine power of the Holy Ghost strikes your heart when it comes and takes all that bitterness he takes that darkness he changes your life listen there's no words on a page that can substitute that there's no shaking a hand or a name on the book that can substitute that the real genuine Barragan I just believe it if you disagree you're free to disagree but for me in my house I just believed he's the same today My gods at 9 1965 the whole enuf thing go off the scene he's still here he's still powerful there man the Braun says you just can't keep still what the church needs is some more Holy Spirit and fire in it that moves it that moves the church takes fire to move the church listen it wasn't just good old gospel singing that moves the church it's not programs and in potlucks that's how that moves some people I tell you what the unit you won't see them for a year but you have free food and they show up it's not free food that moves the church and that promises of fame or money or programs or bigger building fire moves the Church of the Living God that's what moves me that's what moves use a believer not fear fire very brother gonna talk about that Mossback turtle he was a kid he had that turtle he got that thing out and that's thing he wouldn't move that turtle he said I know what I'll do you know what some preachers did I'll get a stick and be them look you don't know because Brian a man you drive cattle you lead sheep and then I don't have to make you serve God if you're a believer you'll serve God amen he went he beat that thing and he tried to rip that thing cause he was pulled back in his shell said I know what I'm doing baptize him I'll stick him in the water and he stuck that turtle down in the water he said he made a few bubbles that was about it who finally said I know what I'll do a lot of fire under him he said that sick stick that mean really lit a fire that surely ain't beginning to murder a man and listen when the Holy Ghost lots of fire in a church who can't stop it you can't put quench it what we need is the Holy Ghost and fire to move us that's what moves me that's what stirs my heart the meaning of the Holy Spirit sometimes he leads me to shout and sometimes it leads me to dances sometimes it leads me to praise God and I say praise God sometimes he leads me in a week sometimes we get real quiet hey man whatever it is I just want to know it's God that's all I hey man that's my concern I just want to be God I'm not trying to follow a program I'm not trying to make it happen there's a fire it's like shut up in my bones there's something on the inside walking toward the outside I can't keep it shut up I cannot forbear it's a fire well praise the Lord no brother branham this is the popular quote well the Rebbe said I'd rather have wild fire there's no fire at all and then I'll not promote wild fire but he said if I had kept that one I'd rather have wild fire and no fire at all which is remarkable to me because most message churches seem to feel the opposite we'd rather just have no fire in a while what we going to think we're for an axe you don't think we're out of control you go these churches well praise the Lord you go some of these churches they're preaching it's fanaticism we don't want any fanaticism in this church we don't we don't wanna bunch a wild fire like this is a big problem around the message well I'm just gonna be wrong astray see a man I could if I was inclined to do so and I'm not because I'm trying to be trying to be the bigger person I could make a list of churches that are formal in their worst messy searches that we just gotta dot every I of the right way gloss over to you you got it but I don't know and this is just me maybe maybe you know more people than I do I could probably count on one hand the number of message churches I know that they're just over my fanaticism and then we act like it's this big ol elf in the room and all the while people what do they do to lettuce in their lukewarm the Luke one condition is the conveyancing condition and we're afraid alarm fire like it's this big problem is just running around the message oh there's just too much sound there's just too much gifts and just too much of these movements all yo yeah then I see the whole room might as well get started here I'm still calm right now you thought that was great I'll leave a movie based on my own site I don't wanna praise got less than I praise them before I wanna praise him off I'm not looking to cry this thing down and and stick in the corner how would all people know people think we praise God too much hair and I praise God ah I'm already jumping on the chandeliers right now I mean I don't thinking homie oh I'm not worried about the fanaticism that's not what's killing the people today but they're freezing we preaching the frozen Chosin they say we've got all these people and they're freezing to death from the church and they're worried they've got their they've got their helmets on and they've got their body armor bless God there's no fanaticism coming my way freezing to death ain't got no fire ain't got no revile ain't got no testimony talk about things God didn't fifty years ago never seen God moving their own life but praise not they ain't got no fanaticism nearby what are we worried about [Applause] if you had to have one and again I'm not not trying to make you all Pentecost 2.0 but if I had to have one I'd rather have the Wildfire then though fire well hallelujah huh and it's just like you know like this big rampant problem in the message churches are just obvious well phrase a little horde you know what happened is got company one time I believe the church order well brother we believe in church order in this church I believe in church order to probably you're going to put an order they have nothing to put in order we're gonna make sure the gifts in our and this and that and then they try to put something or there's nothing there to put an order they gotta have it to put in art well hallelujah listen it's church order not Church seat law carries with it the implication of fear it's fair well the friend of me out I'm afraid of this that's a law that's not the purpose of church think about this now the purpose of church are is not to hinder the move of the Holy Spirit it's actually to help the move of the Holy Spirit by having in an order it promotes though use and the moving of the Holy Ghost so if your vision for church orders nobody should move or say anything wherever you get in the spirit you're under a law and that field that consequences that law you're not caught a limit of that fear this church order it's supposed to out live you ain't got nothing to put an order what are you trying to put an order for people preach this stuff like oh yeah we just got it all figured out me and what they've done the back she hindered the movie you've got that's why they can't have her that's why they can't have joy that's why they can't move because they're afraid of what the Deacon or what somebody next one's gonna say well brother I've talked about a woman like that short I think is one of his meetings a man she come back to it to church after a while and she was in church one day and they were preach and she said a man and the deacon come up of all the people the Deacon come up problem here pinky come outside hey you gotta you gotta keep it down now come back after a while he preaches us I'm Ashley hallelujah he's coming in and you keep that down the third time she doesn't praise God he's his sister why he didn't get so loud why did he do that and she said because I got the Holy Ghost he said well you didn't get it here well hope she wasn't sitting one of these message churches shame on us if it is Amen we ought to have such a place Amen if somebody get the hug us sure they can get it here hopefully man and man I believe this is that kind of church I believe with that kind believers amen surely if something needs the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is here let's see he's not an inn or something or adopted he's a person and he's here he's here to meet you need to come walking on the water to you that makes a statements in the sermon pride 55 I like this quote so much I have a whole sermon on it this one brother has this this is God I'm not against order but watch what he says here God helps to get out of order once in a while the trouble of is you've got too much order ceases you've got too much not God does you've got too much order get out of order I hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved [Applause] take that devil hmm see we got too much horror and they were well we don't look that happy there we would be ashamed my mother and said they'd be ashamed they come up here snarling crying whooping and hollering tongue speaking axe to City they're ashamed but that's the only kind of the word brings fathers you know I realized something God's children are kind of like the kind like other children say what do you mean listen right in that when Billy was talking about that why doesn't she want to have a child it would embarrass her oh well certainly they caught up on your outfit they get stains and they break things they spell and then they make scene we don't want any children that would look unseemly that's why people don't laugh children it's it's a burden and it's it embarrasses us you're looking at the wrong way that's a blessing from the Lord listen I'm glad somebody put up with me when I was a little kid didn't know no better amen listen we shouldn't be ashamed of it amen but that's how our society that's how people are and it's the same way in church well if somebody come here and they're crying we we don't get tears on the carpet now well we don't have to get out the altar we don't wanna get down there and humble ourselves well I hope they get out order just long enough just long enough to get saved listen some people they're so worried some people some Christians they're so worried about making a mistake like that like I talked about that that woman play pray for the blue baby last time they're so worried about messing up and making a mistake they never actually try to do anything and that's worse they go to service after service and they walk out bound by fear if they don't overcome it they walk up bomb my fierce service I and God can move and God can bless and they can have a good test when they can have a Christian life yet somewhere inside there's something calling them to do something in order to live somewhere greater but they're afraid of the failure and they're afraid of the call that would come with it amen so the devil he peddles like these 12 like these 10 spies he tells his doctrines and these ideas of fear and unbelief and they people will they go out bound because of fear and they live below the privileges brother Rama says that we live a million miles below our privilege why do we live there because of fear we're afraid of everything but the Lord which is the only one to be afraid of we're afraid of failure we're afraid of rejection we're free why I'll talk about this person in my life is a young man I was afraid of rejection you've heard my testimony I was afraid of rejection but listen the one who counts accepted me so why do I need to be afraid of rejection well you're afraid of somebody else you're afraid of people rise up against you they were hosting camp against me I won't fear cuz he's with me hey man when you rise the one behind you the one that's in you is greater than everything you're afraid of there's no reason to be afraid praise the Lord you know brother one talks about scarecrows everybody brother been talking about scarecrow hey man y'all know what scarecrow is right I was talking about this over in India I said I got out there the plane in India I said I walked out through the airport I went to the car and the brothers met me and I said you know what I noticed there wasn't one scarecrow in the airport like well yeah why would there be a scarecrow there exactly you don't put a scarecrow just anywhere where do you put a scarecrow out right in the middle of the field and then where the farmer doesn't want you to go that's where you put the scarecrow and then so the devil puts the scarecrow around the moving of the Holy Ghost why cuz that's where he doesn't want you to go well that's where the devil doesn't want you to go then guess where you should probably go and then you're afraid of the very thing God wants you to move towards it and the devil said oh you don't want to be identified with them you don't people call you Pentecostal they're gonna say oh well you're just a bunch of a fanatical Baptist I don't know what kind of Baptist they think well we're yeah I'm gonna get in trouble this one years ago I'm safer if I do that way years ago I was talking to somebody they were talking somebody come up to him because we were going to a certain church and somebody was saying well we go to we go to a message message church you go to a Pentecostal Church I said that's interesting I I've never read that quote I don't know where that distinction apparently they study the message more than I do I'm like oh this is the this is the Methodist kind of message Church and over here's the Pentecostal mass desertion where the message message Church I'm thinking I thought there was one message one faith one more woman but I'm not making these the phrase the Lord I'm not trying to make these distinction what I'm saying is people do this well well that's just this and that's just that what is that that's nothing what the Bible says it's not what the word says not saying everybody has to worship the same way please don't think I'm here to preach a cookie cutter religion because I'm not about that either nothin y'all don't worship the same way you'd be like this church for what I'm saying is why do we look at this and we test these names like it's some sort of a thing to insult or deride or make fun of them thing and praise the Lord well I am Pentecostal by birth and then that's that's not my denomination that's my experience so by New Birth I am Pentecostal that's true hey man but I'm not part of an organization I'm part of an organism the body of Christ and then and you're a member and Eiling them and the member together edifies itself in their love amen that's why we come together it's the same body so here comes a scarecrow he's up in the middle of blessing listen if he's in the middle of this blessing then that's what I want and then the Scarecrow is an indicator where you should actually go because they only put the Scarecrow up so that's where you need to go amen whatever you're afraid of in your life that's exactly what God wants for you don't let the devil scare you from it no don't let the devil scare you from a greater testimony from a greater sanctification from a greater walk a greater prayer life why would you be afraid of those things well I don't want to testify somebody might think of a fanatic or maybe someone get saves so we always look at the negative the kingdom of God is not negative it's positive well it might fail but it might succeed what might not work but it might see this was that quarterly well could it happen not only can it happen it will happen because he said it amen it's not my promise I don't have to back it up I don't have to vindicate it he's the one that said it it's not on me to perform it's not on you it's just for it's for us to believe Amen that's how God works raise little heart that's what the happen was Israel they put a scarecrow up there in the land oh we can't take those giants there's walled cities colleagues and kings and what's greater amen see they preached fear to the people and the people receive it they didn't cross over because of fear uncertainty and fear was the only thing it wasn't distance wasn't the lack of a promise and wasn't the lack of anything the only thing that held the Mac was fear and uncertainty amen the praise God for a Joshua in a Caleb they had a different spirit they said we are more than able to take the land and brothers and sisters let me testify to you this afternoon I don't care what some of the preacher is sad or what some person is said if God said it in this Bible or he said in this message you can believe for it you don't have to be ashamed you don't have to back up on it you're up explaining you have to compromise you don't have to sell out you can believe it as the Lord said it this bride she has left saith the Lord and she knows what he was that was it but see then give us at the Lord to sit on it or stick it in the ground or just a war appeal taking you thus saith the Lord to be an overcomer he wants you to take the line and just possess every evil spirit and everything happening that's contrary to him in your home and in your life every evil thing in every dark power you have the ability to Christ nothing to see most of it got to the feast holder to defeat every enemy any place anywhere anytime I'm not satisfied with with a partial victory this this is my competitive side coming out but you know what they say about second place second place is just the first loser I don't want to be second place in the key McGraw listen we've had the boat on pass to us that's not me racing against you that's not what it is but we run the race with patience together and then we're not here to overcome almost everything we've heard overcome every power of the enemy I've been with this bride is leaving this world in a defeated condition maliciously losing condition I wish is going out like they left that prom it was like they left Egypt for the promised land will not leave a hook behind we'll take all the riches we'll take a little spoil we'll take our loved ones will take their young we'll take my old and any enemy that tries to follow us will be utterly destroyed I'm going to a place well I won't see those enemies anymore now listen that's not just heaven the promises the Holy Ghost that means in this life there are things there are fears in your life maybe this morning this afternoon things in your life that maybe you rested with your whole life maybe you want to fear or whatever it is you don't have to see it ever again God is able to make away where there is no way and I want to overthrow that enemy you don't have to live with insecurity you'd have to live with self-loathing and doubt and wondering am I good enough am i this of that you can watch that and leave me over overthrown in this life I don't want you to put that out there somewhere else your eyes today you can have victory remember the bread says this he says Joshua and all this knowing that the command was great but having the assurance he could be fearless I like how he says this he could be as we caught reckless woo a man as long as he was putting the right way and I'm a comma the recklessness of youth or inexperience I'm talking about the recklessness that comes when you're doing your point of the right way what didn't know it's God that Senate he's pointing the right way you can be reckless listen Elijah oh my when he went up and fix them promised the bail he did just rebuild altars they got cups of water on it I've dumped some more you don't dig a trench I do whatever you want he's got pretty bold because he had the word of the Lord he could be rolled he knew that God given a commandment that he would call fire down from heaven we've got a commander and said there's nothing that could stop that there wasn't a whole water and the Sea of Galilee to stop it and then there wasn't a prophet the battle on the back and when you realize God has called you and commissioned you and you realized that cause you can be reckless as long as your point of the right way he might break up against the hill that would knock him backwards but he was carried the right way soaked in the charge of the Living God be reckless in fearless in faith if we're pointed the right way for he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not fail you I'll not forsake you he never forsaken Moses he never found Moses he will not fail Joshua he will not fail us he'll be with us why am I saying all this I want you to come up higher amen if you're living in fear don't live there another day don't don't choose to live the hairy man you said what I've got this and I'm got that I understand you can't overcome by yourself that's why you didn't leave you alone that's why he's here a man listen I understand my nature especially not I'm as I get older I'm a cautious person I was I try to teach the children don't take unnecessary risks like climbing a tree right before church this morning look if I looked at me there's there's six other days in the week to do that why would you there right before church and I get cautioned there's nothing wrong with caution actually is a good thing amen because and shouldn't you shouldn't you shouldn't be reckless for the sake of being reckless you know I know some people well this is this that and I'm gonna be this and the Lord told me that well is it the word though amen but listen when Peter and then we've talked we wear this in our scripture when Peter saw the Lord coming he said you know what that's really God he's really the same that's the same Jesus if he's walking in the water then that means I can walk on the water think about this Jesus didn't come to show you or do anything that you can't do by the spirit the same and then when He healed the sick he healed the sick so his disciples would realize you can do the same thing and then when he overcome darkness when he multiplied the loaves when he walked on water it was so his disciples to realize if you believe you can do the same thing the works I do shall you do also and greater than these so you do because I know the father he wasn't showing you something just impress you but he's showing you this is what they're capable of if you believe I'm I feel good if he did it amen I think about the things that he did to show you that you are capable if you've seen in this mountain amen not if he says if you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast in the sea and don't doubt your heart you shall have what you ask he's trying should have confidence not in your flesh but in what he's put in your life see when you have fear you don't really have faith in a man some of us are our own biggest critic but I want you understand his maybe you're your own biggest critic you may be you have a lot of critics but you've got one that's giving you a seal of approval he's approved your faith he's approved you for the kingdom he's sealed through the day your Redemption hey doesn't matter how much how much incurred or discouragement you go through how disappoint you get he's already sealed you get him Hannah here comes Peter says I want to walk on the water Lord if that's you you did me come you know what he said come he doesn't have to play a four-hour tape for him hey man like the woman well she only had to hear once and then he said come now listen I can prevent brother Brent talks about this Peter didn't have to get down pray about it first didn't have to fast 40 days you've got to study it out when he knew was the Lord and the Lord said calm you know what he did well I don't know of the other disciples what they'll think about me if I can get out of the water they're gonna they're gonna think I'm a fanatic he didn't care about any of that hear the Lord say come guess what he did he come out of the boat he's walking on the water here here's a man this is my my optimistic side you know we often focused about how you know eventually Peter sink yeah when he got afraid see fear didn't do him one good it actually hindered him we talked about Peter all if he don't believe you want to sunk but I want you to realize he did walk on water a man while he believes he did the same thing Jesus did he walk on the water amen and listen we funny how people criticize no Peter I have a fight a bit me well at least he walked on the water first well coming walking on water in Ohio's was 32 degrees or colder this man walked on not just water but a water in a stormy sea and what I love about this then he was afraid listen I'm not saying they're good hey man I'm not saying never be tempted to be afraid as a Christian I hope you understand that what I'm saying is there's one greater than the fear and when he become afraid and when he'd be into sick Jesus didn't say well that's what you get you know good unbeliever well if you had faith I wouldn't have to even be here like some people well come on Peter we need you step it up man he didn't say well get in the water you you know he did he took his hand he lifted him up the ramp said we as believers have the same lives if we find that we are sinking we have the same right to call him to pick us up so don't be worried about failing just even if you falter he'll still pick you up I want that encourages somebody we're so afraid of failing we look at we look at his failure what we forget is success we look at families in life we forget about all that God's done for us well but I made a mistake here and I messed this up what about all the things God did do in your life look at what he's done that's why it's so important to testify what he's done amen praise the Lord I'm so grateful no he's got he's got your hand maybe sit here today you hear this a lot just I wish that was for me he's got your hand that's what makes the difference not me saying it it's who's saying it it's who's doing it the same one is holding your hand I can't hold your hand everywhere in laughs your past you can't hold your hand everywhere but Jesus is here he'll take you by the hand he has able to lift you the Bible says he's able to keep you from falling this is how you're able to keep you he is able to keep you so even if you touch your own even if you begin to falter he'll stop you from going underwire [Applause] listen he didn't walk all the way out there in the middle of a storm to let you drown because you followed his word amen he's not gonna cook he's like a little mountain pray and do all this and come down and come to you and say don't be a friends that wasn't you I didn't know you'd mess up that bad I wanted to come out here the first place amen he's not like that amen that's not his nature he's giving you every reason not to be afraid even if he would but even if you would you would you would make a mistake or fault to a man he's greater than the mistake listen that's what it's not that you don't have fear it's that perfect love casts it out I mean he's greater than the fear he's greater than the circumstance it's not that there is no trial it's not that there is no fear don't get this up it's not this mind over matter saying Amen brother time talks about healing that way it's not that you're not sick we're just trying to convince you it's not Christian science you are sick but the healer is greater than the sickness greater is He that's next missing the boat with you then the storm is all around you you believe that [Music] he that fears the Bible says is not made perfect in life you understand it's perfect over there this is perfect laughs hey man listen the rapture the rapture is not made for the fearful hey man I'm just gonna bring it down here for a second the Bible tells you where the fearful lot there outside the city amen but you're not made perfect in fear where you made perfect in love amen that's where you're made perfect listen God does not desire for you to live in fear you believe that this message is more than just doctrine it's more than information it's him his voice his assurance I'm not going to let you sink you might feel like you're going to but I'm not going to listen if our hearts condemn us he's greater than your heart they realized that I could testify his Paul I am persuaded there's nothing that can separate us if he's got you in his hand even when you are tempted to fear and disbelieve maybe you're in that situation this afternoon maybe you're sitting there going through the worst try your life I don't know what y'all going through but maybe he rose in the storm of your lives and it feels like God's a million miles away I want you to know he's here and he's got your hand you don't have to walk out of those doors carrying the burden of fear and worry laying awake at night will he accept me will he help me he's been accepted in the beloved if he's got you in his hand there's nothing that can separate you if the storm can't pull him under they can't stop him from pulling you up hey man my my he's an ever-present help in the times of trouble no don't be afraid of for NASA fanaticism and all this if you ever get a chance maybe you probably hopefully listen to it but brother Ram preachers got a hidden simplicity after the seals an Albuquerque New Mexico in 1964 he's doing altar call people are getting the Holy Ghost and he says see he's talking about certain minister he said they begin to move on him and said because he couldn't surrender he was afraid of it they said if he had just surrendered to it and then if he just we're on through with it God would have less time a man and brother babies don't be afraid of fanaticism if there's finessin we would know it listen the devil don't want to come in here and help you out he's not here to bless you but all of the people to praise God louder want the people to shout I want the people to do that that's God amen you don't want you to be afraid listen if there's a you can stand your feet listen if there's anywhere there's anything all rise if there's anywhere if there's any way you ought to feel comfortable worshiping the Lord it should be here is that right we're believers we believe I know I know you like to worship the Lord I heard you all this morning but what I want you to understand is when you go out of this building nothing changes about who you are amen he doesn't stay in here he goes with you if he's with you there's no reason to be afraid it's what I encourage you don't live a life of fear don't don't live a life spent and worried some people they're there long tighter than a yo-yo I tell you huh just everything's a big deal we're always afraid God doesn't God didn't create the human heart to worry brother Ram Singh I think you said 80% of sickness is caused by nervousness and worry God don't want that for you amen you believe that see I wanna hear you testify God don't want that for me sometimes we sometimes we think God doesn't want it for your neighbor for the preacher but he does for me no God doesn't want you to live in worry in fear he wants you to have Liberty he wants you to have boldness you should be able to look the devil right in the eye and tell him get out of my house get out of my life you're not taking my paralyzed you're not taking my children you're not welcome to anything I'm not going to sink I'm not gonna be pulled under there's a power greater than me that's holding me up I can't sink even if I want to let's bow our heads Father we're just so thankful Lord ah maybe a simple thought but a thing many people many of your children they wrestle with father weren't an age of fearfulness lower the scripture tells us that men's hearts in this age would fail for fear well it's a more treacherous and more wicked a more evil time than other believers in the past have had to face the darkness it's a gross darkness all but I'm so thankful for a life that shines light was able to illuminate our understanding to guide us to drive out every feeder to push back all the darkness Lord I believe today for your children that are here Lord I believe there's some I've seen people that are just a they're afraid to even serve God because they're so afraid they'll fail Lord what a what a condition to live in Lord ah I don't believe you want us to live in fear I know you don't want us to live in fear you you made a way you took out the sting of death Lord we're not the fearful but we're the believing today we're the bold the righteous we can declare with certainty Lord that we are your chosen people God has filled us with his spirit he's strengthened us in our body he's given us a voice to praise Him what I pray you bless each one father if there be one here today but if there be one here today in the son of my voice that's carried a burden of fear maybe something from the time they were a child maybe something recent whatever it is maybe they throw that burden down at your feet today better than a walkout
