[37:36] some pictures here and now to see how
[37:37] the Lord will take it this morning
[37:40] because I have some things on my heart

[37:44] into the word of the Lord one reminds
[37:48] you we we set the communion service for
[37:51] 3:30 this afternoon and the reason that
[37:55] we had done that has just try to allow
[37:58] as little time in between so we didn't
[38:02] have things dragging on in between
[38:03] services and time and we can get back
[38:07] here and and go right into the communion
[38:10] service without any delay so the Lord
[38:12] willing that should work out well for us
[38:15] there at 3:30 amen if you will you know
[38:20] what while we're waiting waiting Nita
[38:22] let me hook this up here thank you Miss
[38:24] Brian why don't you turn in your Bibles
[38:26] to Isaiah chapter 11 it's not what I'm
[38:29] going to preach from but you can at
[38:31] least get a little hold there well you
[38:37] know I'm the pastor of this church I got
[38:38] a tambourine in my bag
[38:42] and I don't know how it got there they
[38:48] find some other good things in there too
[38:55] it's not a big tampering it's a little
[39:04] this in Isaiah chapter 11 verse 10 and
[39:09] through verse 12 there this is a this is
[39:15] a scripture here that that brother
[39:20] Rowell and go ahead and give me up on
[39:22] vga one this is a scripture that brother
[39:25] Rowell and the brothers over there
[39:27] really had we're just really bringing to
[39:31] our attention and this is just I really
[39:35] believe a fulfillment of what we see
[39:38] there because there say you you've
[39:40] witnessed it as a congregation here over
[39:42] a number of years of the reports of
[39:46] things that are going on and taking
[39:48] place in the Philippines and it's just
[39:51] truly just the great work of the Lord
[39:55] and you know it would not have it would
[39:58] not have happened if God did not provide
[40:02] the direction and the leadership in
[40:05] order for that to take place and you
[40:07] most of you you know of the things that
[40:11] have have taken place where brother al
[40:14] had the burden on his heart to do the
[40:17] mystery expose because many of the the
[40:21] ministers and different ones they're
[40:23] there they're longing for new material
[40:25] so brother o L put together many
[40:29] different powerpoints and he would go in
[40:32] and they would you know offer a
[40:35] minister's Expo or seminar and that
[40:38] would get their attention because the
[40:39] ministers wanted new things to bring to
[40:41] their assemblies and so you know as you
[40:45] go through the whole they go through the
[40:47] whole presentation sometimes a couple
[40:49] days sometimes one day they go through
[40:51] all of these that brother oil has
[40:53] just laid out there in the scripture and
[40:56] you know it were Bible schools Bible
[40:59] students and different ones have
[41:00] actually been brought there and there's
[41:02] been is the reports have been over the
[41:04] years there are entire churches have
[41:07] have come and embraced for the message
[41:10] of the hour it's just a real wonderful
[41:13] thing I got a chance to meet and
[41:14] actually ministered in some of those
[41:17] places that where those pastors and and
[41:20] and now in in those places you have
[41:23] pastors who are there as young men
[41:25] because those who had embraced that in
[41:28] the message with the church they've
[41:30] they've moved on or they've either
[41:32] passed on and so you see the work of the
[41:35] Lord continuing so we want to just just
[41:39] read here in the scriptures it says and
[41:41] in that day there shall be a root of
[41:43] Jesse which shall stand for an in sign
[41:45] of the people to each shall the Gentiles
[41:48] seek and his rest shall be glorious and
[41:51] it shall come to pass in that day that
[41:52] the Lord shall set his hand against the
[41:55] set again the second time to recover the
[41:58] remnant of his people which shall be
[42:00] left from Assyria from Egypt from
[42:03] Pathros from cush alam from shanaar and
[42:06] from Hamas and from the islands of the
[42:08] sea and they really really really lay on
[42:11] that from the islands of the sea because
[42:13] the Philippines itself is made up of
[42:15] over 7,000 islands and he shall set up
[42:19] an ensign for the nations and shall
[42:20] assemble the outcasts of Israel and
[42:23] gather together the dispersed of Judah
[42:25] from the four corners of the earth so
[42:28] it's truly a time where God is is
[42:31] redeeming and laying claim to that which
[42:34] belongs to him I just want to kind of in
[42:39] going just going back a little bit maybe
[42:41] to try to give a little bit of just a
[42:45] little bit of a an idea of where where
[42:51] that it's at just in case anyone doesn't
[42:53] know that but here very very close there
[42:56] you can see to Vietnam they see the
[42:58] Philippines there in the middle and then
[43:00] just in relation to where we're at
[43:03] and my you know that's a map that when I
[43:05] was there I did not want to see that map
[43:08] right there because that meant that my
[43:10] family was right there my wife was there
[43:13] and I was here but don't block those
[43:16] thoughts out so it's it's quite a you
[43:21] know it's on really on the other side of
[43:22] the world and you see here just a little
[43:25] bit of fun I apologize would it help if
[43:28] I turn these lights off would help I
[43:31] apologize that this is a little blurry
[43:33] here it's because of the connection that
[43:37] that would that I have going through
[43:38] here is that better okay so here there
[43:46] I've showed you this because we most of
[43:48] our time was really concentrated around
[43:51] Manila I need to lower this just a
[43:53] little bit this was really concentrated
[43:56] around Manila we also went out into
[43:58] you'll see in just a moment we go out
[44:00] into this area over here into Samar so
[44:03] the the two main places where we were
[44:05] going we flew into Manila and then we
[44:08] were traveling to the island of Samar
[44:10] and to go there we flew from Manila down
[44:14] here to Cebu and then from Cebu over to
[44:17] caballo the island of Samar this is this
[44:24] is the the camp meeting that they were
[44:27] having and brother Gerry a brother Oh al
[44:30] and myself were ministering there at
[44:33] three services a day brother Rael took
[44:35] the middle service and we allowed us to
[44:40] rest but it allowed them to speak just
[44:43] in in the native language without any
[44:46] translation in the island of Samarra I
[44:49] just skipped that other one because this
[44:51] is this brings it a little bit more to
[44:53] you we were right here in caballo in
[44:55] Samar so we flew in here and this is
[44:58] where that camp meeting is taking place
[45:00] we had just about I think three or four
[45:02] hours of sleep we landed with one the
[45:04] first night we got there and brother or
[45:07] else we've sweep this away we could not
[45:09] even go to even though brother o-l lives
[45:12] in a part of Manila
[45:15] we couldn't go from the airport to his
[45:17] house because in order to do that even
[45:20] though it's only from his house to the
[45:22] airport is about nine miles it would
[45:24] have taken us over three hours to get
[45:26] there so we had to actually just stay
[45:30] very very close to the airport and then
[45:32] we which allowed us to have a few hours
[45:35] of sleep and then we had to get up and
[45:37] board the plane early to fly here we
[45:39] came into the bayou and my that's you
[45:42] know you can kind of see it's a very
[45:43] very very small airport I think even the
[45:46] airports that we have here in the state
[45:47] some of the smaller ones would probably
[45:50] be bigger than this Airport the the
[45:52] baggage claim area there is no belt it's
[45:57] just men bringing the bags in there's no
[45:59] there's nothing moving it along you they
[46:01] just push it on tables and you know I
[46:03] have pictures of that as well but it's
[46:05] just you know and you're there and you
[46:08] know in the plane itself is the
[46:09] propellers you know on the plane it's
[46:11] it's it's not a little puddle jumper but
[46:13] it has propellers on it and so you know
[46:17] it I don't know if it's just an older
[46:19] plane an older model that they received
[46:22] but anyhow we we did have a wonderful a
[46:24] trip there in the Lord gave us safe
[46:26] travels we come in here to the the
[46:29] camp-meeting and this is out there in
[46:32] the in the in the the country there of
[46:36] caballos so we flew in and then coming
[46:40] you see a little bit more into the the
[46:42] venue where the camp meeting is gonna be
[46:43] taking place and brother-brother lanlan
[46:47] which is the host pastor he they just
[46:50] had built this church here just within
[46:54] the past two years and so they had been
[46:58] having church there right there in the
[47:01] city where he's located which is right
[47:03] there but the Lord provided that
[47:06] property for them and if you remember
[47:08] the Wednesday night brother Jerry spoke
[47:10] on possessing the unknown and I made
[47:13] mention to you that I had received
[47:15] reports from the airline that you may
[47:18] have to reschedule and you know because
[47:21] of weather that was coming up and there
[47:23] was a typhoon that was coming through
[47:25] that area and the typhoon itself
[47:29] it the direction diverted you know into
[47:34] Japan and that's really where they were
[47:36] looking at our flight being hindered is
[47:39] right there in in Tokyo
[47:41] the typhoon continued to come but it was
[47:43] more direct in that area but it was the
[47:45] it was the rain and one of the things
[47:48] that's just a real testimony to the
[47:50] prayers not only here but also is well
[47:53] over there is the the rain itself
[47:56] stopped on the Monday before we even
[47:59] left here and from from that typhoon and
[48:02] that's a that's a real rainy season for
[48:04] him and you should have had to rain from
[48:06] the typhoon one of the arms coming out
[48:08] there and that rain did not resume again
[48:11] until the Monday after we were finished
[48:13] it just was the Lord and the thing of it
[48:16] is is that I'll show you a picture here
[48:18] in just a moment if if it had been where
[48:21] that rain if it had rain during that
[48:24] time which that's their normal rainy
[48:25] season I honestly don't know how that we
[48:28] would have been able to even walk up to
[48:32] the church or even to to get around in
[48:35] that area where they were having the
[48:36] meetings because they didn't hold it at
[48:38] a campground this year they the brother
[48:39] just held it there and I don't know how
[48:43] we would have been able to get around I
[48:44] don't know how the believers would have
[48:45] been able to set outside even though
[48:47] they had tarps that's because of the
[48:48] amount of rain and the mud and how that
[48:51] would have been running so God was so
[48:53] merciful for that this is this is
[48:55] brother brother lanlan is that he was
[48:57] the host pastor here of the of the of
[49:01] the meetings and just a picture of
[49:05] brother landlord's family and it's just
[49:09] a blessing every one of them
[49:11] I think except the young lady right here
[49:13] every one of them were right there on
[49:15] that stage playing instrument and right
[49:19] there in the service but I tell you what
[49:21] she really has a dynamic voice just
[49:24] being able to really enter in it all of
[49:26] them sing as well so and brother lanlan
[49:29] I don't have the picture on here but
[49:31] brother lanlan actually makes guitars
[49:34] yes it looks just like that bass guitar
[49:36] right there and other guitars just makes
[49:38] it right out of hand he gets the little
[49:40] parts from United States but he
[49:42] then you know makes it all out of the
[49:43] wood you can kind of see here that the
[49:46] place where they had actually been able
[49:48] to construct heading into these meetings
[49:50] right here is where the believers the
[49:54] quarters were those believers who are
[49:55] coming in where they were going to stay
[49:57] and there were believers that had
[49:59] traveled down from ran on the northern
[50:03] part from Manila all the way down they
[50:05] had to take a ferry between two of the
[50:07] islands and it took them I think was
[50:10] about 2425 hours
[50:12] some of them to get there by then and
[50:14] and the amount of people in the van I
[50:16] just I was just amazed I told her I told
[50:21] the brothers I'm just amazed because
[50:25] they were traveling and they picked up
[50:27] more I don't know how they they they put
[50:29] him in there but you know they did this
[50:34] is on the back part of the church
[50:35] they're gonna be making that into Sunday
[50:37] school rooms but also they use that he
[50:40] will use it and did use it in these
[50:42] meetings for sleeping quarters or
[50:44] visiting believers see some of the some
[50:48] of the pictures share show you of the
[50:49] believers worshipping during the time of
[50:52] the camp me you can kind of see out
[50:54] through there they had the what I was
[50:55] telling you about the chairs they had
[50:57] set up there out there they also had it
[50:58] had the chairs set up off to the side
[51:01] over here and the windows so that the
[51:03] people could could hear the services as
[51:07] well these were the pastor's that that
[51:11] attended the camp meeting and and some
[51:15] of them like the brother here he
[51:17] traveled like 24 25 hours here to be in
[51:21] that service and it's just a real real
[51:22] wonderful unity that was there among
[51:25] among the brothers and a rung among the
[51:27] saints of God and as I was ministering
[51:30] and even actually I think it was he
[51:33] might have been one brother Jeremy's
[51:34] ministry I noticed within the church I
[51:37] thought lord have mercy there's so many
[51:39] young people here in this service you
[51:43] know and so with that right there you
[51:45] know I just my heart I just really
[51:48] started in the services just you know
[51:50] the Lord just even really taken a
[51:52] direction for for the young people and
[51:55] of course they you know one wanted a
[51:57] picture and when they get into pictures
[51:59] man it's just like it's non-stop I think
[52:03] selfie was invented in the Philippines
[52:06] so they you know they was really a
[52:12] wonderful time there with the with with
[52:16] all of them and here you find a little
[52:20] place they had set up this is on the out
[52:22] outside of the church there where have a
[52:25] line where you see some of the believers
[52:27] I got a few pictures of where they're
[52:28] starting to go into and eat there after
[52:31] service they they cooked on the ground
[52:32] they had people that were designated and
[52:34] they they cooked breakfast they cooked
[52:36] lunch they could suffer for for all of
[52:39] the people and then you have here I took
[52:43] another little picture in this little
[52:44] area right here this is part of the
[52:47] kitchen but then there's a they have the
[52:49] fire out to the right where there was a
[52:51] brother that was the brother actually
[52:53] did all of the cooking as far as for the
[52:55] meat from the you know from the beef to
[52:57] the water buffalo to the you know they
[53:00] lachung you know they're wanting to put
[53:03] that out and you know inlet own and you
[53:04] know they were wanting to show me their
[53:06] Cheech other that's it that's that's not
[53:08] I don't need to teach our own he's like
[53:09] that mine are more crisp but I did have
[53:14] some I took a picture of some of the
[53:15] buffet very very good but this one here
[53:19] I just you know I we it was such a
[53:24] wonderful thing that they had had done
[53:26] but you can see what I'm talking about
[53:28] with the wisdom with the dirt if it had
[53:30] rained this is where we had come in off
[53:33] the street here off the road if it had
[53:35] rain all of this you know you're kind of
[53:36] walking up a little bit of a hill that
[53:38] got a little swell for the water to
[53:40] travel but I honestly don't know how we
[53:42] would have been able to do this because
[53:44] you see right at the very next day the
[53:47] next morning here's the rain from the
[53:49] typhoon right here right after the
[53:51] camp-meeting it's just it's coming down
[53:53] the river that was on the other side
[53:55] over the hotel we were staying it rolls
[53:58] just within that one night it rose I
[54:00] would say at least at least about two
[54:03] foot if not three foot I was amazing it
[54:05] took a picture of it because the rivers
[54:07] right there right up next to the
[54:08] to to the little cafe and I took a
[54:10] picture of it and it was already up to
[54:12] that place where I could see the marks
[54:14] on the cement and it might have been
[54:16] well over three foot it just was a it
[54:19] was just I couldn't believe it we heard
[54:21] it in our room raining but I didn't know
[54:22] what it was I thought well I don't know
[54:25] maybe it's rain that's outside or but
[54:26] you know the Lord was so mindful of us
[54:28] I'm going to show you a little picture
[54:30] here a couple of pictures because I
[54:31] gotta show you some things that be a
[54:32] little bit funny here you know because
[54:35] there was so many funny things that
[54:36] happened during that during the trip and
[54:38] think the Lord for that as well you know
[54:40] you had a here's a little pull here's a
[54:43] little thing now this is this is a
[54:51] motorcycle and then you know they put
[54:55] this over top of that motorcycle there's
[54:58] a chair right up here right next to the
[55:00] driver where the jury's gonna get in
[55:01] there and then beside brother Giri is a
[55:06] brother brother VIN brother VIN you know
[55:08] is a pastor here I'll show you in just a
[55:11] little bit and what we're doing is a
[55:13] very important mission
[55:14] we're traveling for coffee now I know
[55:17] you think it's my idea this was not my
[55:19] idea I found out the very next morning
[55:22] after we got to some more before we
[55:24] started the meetings that brother Allen
[55:26] one of the pastor's here that you'll see
[55:28] in a few moments brother Alan took a
[55:30] tricycle out into the city because
[55:33] brother Allen likes good coffee and see
[55:37] we were drinking the powdered instant
[55:39] coffee you gotta use your imagination
[55:43] you know you imagination imagine you
[55:45] know so brother Jay and I were taking
[55:47] there so when brother Allen said hey he
[55:48] said last night I went on a mission and
[55:50] I scoped out the town I said well why
[55:52] did you do that he said you know we
[55:54] wanted to check out for coffee I said oh
[55:56] man so they asked do you wanna go I said
[55:58] let's go let's let's go let's go
[56:00] so anyhow we went we went down there and
[56:03] now in the back there was already a
[56:06] person here setting in the back brother
[56:08] Roy gets down and sets right there
[56:10] then brother Owen says come on in here
[56:12] he said there's plenty of room so I
[56:13] jumped in here and then brother Allen
[56:16] comes in there were four of us back here
[56:17] three up front
[56:21] that motorcycle was in the process of I
[56:24] think I can at least it never come to I
[56:30] thought I could it overcame it and then
[56:33] here we are on the way back so on the
[56:35] way back you know we a little bit less
[56:38] room and they put brother Jerry and
[56:40] brother VIN up front again and then they
[56:41] have brother brother Oh L and brother
[56:45] Alan there and they have me to sit here
[56:46] and put my feet right here okay you know
[56:51] I thought man you know it might be all
[56:52] right I got something hanging on to well
[56:54] you know how it is
[56:56] some of you there's been over in those
[56:57] other places and countries you know the
[57:00] horn is decorations here you all know
[57:03] what I'm talking about I tell them that
[57:05] I told I've told to the brothers in
[57:07] Ghana
[57:07] I said look horns are decorations
[57:09] they're novelty here they're not
[57:11] we don't you really use them I said you
[57:13] all use them yes sir you got a morse
[57:16] code like beep-beep I'm turning right
[57:18] beep-beep I'm turning left let me out
[57:20] I'm coming out it doesn't matter what's
[57:21] going on I've come out got a faith to
[57:24] drive here man so anyhow they have me
[57:28] here on this and I and and and the story
[57:30] was is that you know they're driving and
[57:33] you know it's almost like what the you
[57:36] know the Lorraine Ian's tried to do to
[57:38] Route six here before they put all those
[57:39] lines down Route six thank God they just
[57:41] did that they would you know want to
[57:43] make six lanes out of one lane well
[57:46] that's what they were doing here and my
[57:47] feet were on the edge right there and
[57:49] here comes this big old bagel bus coming
[57:52] by and I seen the bus I'm moving off
[57:54] feed him and then I realized wait a
[57:56] minute there's the motorcycle wheels
[57:57] right here so I'm trying to move my feet
[58:00] and I said Oh Lord don't let my toes go
[58:02] down that way
[58:03] but I mean that thing was right there
[58:05] right and right in front of me I
[58:06] remember the colors it was dark pink
[58:08] here and light pink up here it just went
[58:10] right by and I remember seeing the
[58:11] rivets lord help me so they you know
[58:15] they were they got a chuckle out of that
[58:17] but for me it was serious that's a very
[58:20] very prominent mode of transportation
[58:22] there there among them you have many
[58:26] that there are drivers there's some of
[58:28] the brothers even in the church even a
[58:30] brother oels that that do that
[58:32] for for a living this is one of the
[58:37] things that's very very very common and
[58:39] they're travel in the Philippines is
[58:41] that GP and the jeepney is just it's
[58:45] it's old war vehicles which you see here
[58:48] how they'll they'll get up on the back
[58:50] and get in you got the driver in the
[58:51] front and it's just it's it's a taxi
[58:53] service this is a little bit better
[58:55] picture of it and they'll get in and
[58:57] they just they haul them around from
[58:59] point to point they're actually doing
[59:00] away with these in the city of Manila as
[59:03] of December they will no longer be able
[59:05] to use those because they're all diesel
[59:06] and they're going more to e
[59:09] environmental things with vans so that
[59:13] they will those will not be allowed in
[59:14] the city of Manila so the Lord within
[59:18] that meeting there in Samar the Lord
[59:21] really really blessed there were many
[59:24] lives that were touched and I'm just
[59:26] going by at the services of what had
[59:29] taken place and you know then afterwards
[59:31] you know I have not had any other
[59:34] reports but I you know you just see the
[59:36] response when the word is is going forth
[59:40] and how that the people are responding
[59:42] to to the word and they were very very
[59:45] receptive and I I know that there were
[59:47] lives that were touched I believe that
[59:49] with all my heart lives that were that
[59:51] were changed and you know sometimes we
[59:53] don't ever you may not ever see anything
[59:55] on this side or no of it but you have
[59:57] that confidence that the word will not
[59:59] return back to the employee
[1:00:00] see the response and people in the lives
[1:00:02] and hearts you know hands being uplifted
[1:00:04] and hearts coming you know to the Lord
[1:00:06] so then we we made our journey back to
[1:00:10] Manila and on the journey back to Manila
[1:00:15] we made a stopover in in Seibu because
[1:00:19] we had to in change flights there and we
[1:00:23] just we got a chance to meet with a
[1:00:25] brother a pastor a young man who would
[1:00:27] take over a church and we got a chance
[1:00:29] to meet with him brother Marlon is his
[1:00:31] name
[1:00:32] and we had went there because brother
[1:00:33] Giri had known his dad and brother o.l
[1:00:36] kind of wanted to re-establish that
[1:00:38] contact there so we we went there we
[1:00:42] come back into Manila and we're actually
[1:00:45] where the church is gonna be at is right
[1:00:46] here in TyTy and we are here at the
[1:00:50] convention now the convention was in
[1:00:51] this time it's only one day they do a
[1:00:54] one day convention here at brother oels
[1:00:58] church and they do that because during
[1:01:03] this time when we had the camp meeting
[1:01:05] there beginning on the 27th and then all
[1:01:08] the way through this week through
[1:01:10] through that particular week the kids
[1:01:12] and most everybody else had time off
[1:01:14] they have two weeks off like we have
[1:01:15] Christmas break and it's because of All
[1:01:18] Saints Day All Souls Day it's a very
[1:01:20] very important thing there so they take
[1:01:22] time off so this is why that people are
[1:01:26] able to gather in and they have the
[1:01:28] meetings like they do at that time so we
[1:01:31] had a day really actually about two days
[1:01:35] here I mean one day we had there in
[1:01:37] Monday and some more than Tuesday we
[1:01:39] traveled back to Manila Wednesday we
[1:01:41] started in the convention brother o el
[1:01:43] obviously the host pastor there in the
[1:01:46] convention and then you see some of the
[1:01:50] of the pastors that are present that's
[1:01:52] not all of the pastors but there is
[1:01:53] there is a good representation and some
[1:01:56] of those pastors standing right there
[1:01:58] many of those are pastors that have come
[1:02:00] out from the mystery expose where where
[1:02:05] one you know to the Lord in their
[1:02:07] congregation so see some of the
[1:02:10] believers that are coming in and it's
[1:02:12] raining this is theirs there during this
[1:02:14] there was rain still from the typhoon
[1:02:17] that was reaching in here to Manila and
[1:02:20] it's very wet day but the believers here
[1:02:23] they are they're arriving for that
[1:02:24] convention here we are and this is a
[1:02:28] place right next to brother brother Rho
[1:02:31] elz the church itself that they were
[1:02:34] able to purchase and they brother o L
[1:02:37] and the different believers that were
[1:02:40] there the older ones were quick to
[1:02:43] remind me that
[1:02:44] your dad is also very very instrumental
[1:02:47] when he heard of this he directly gave
[1:02:50] right towards that and that was probably
[1:02:51] within the last six or seven years or
[1:02:56] what-have-you and so that was really
[1:02:59] kind of gripping you know when I looked
[1:03:02] there at that I knew when I was here
[1:03:04] within I think Manila especially as well
[1:03:07] because I know dad had not spoken that
[1:03:09] venue but dad had as far as that that
[1:03:11] place but I knew dad was there so that
[1:03:14] was a it was a challenging time as far
[1:03:18] as you know where you have to kind of go
[1:03:19] beyond all of those those thoughts you
[1:03:21] know but there's here's brother Pete
[1:03:24] leading the song service and I'm telling
[1:03:26] you right now brother Pete was leading
[1:03:28] the song sort of getting the people in
[1:03:30] fellowship and brother Jerry and I
[1:03:31] looked at one another now when you look
[1:03:33] at it right here who do you think he
[1:03:35] would look like say it again
[1:03:37] brother bill he was like brother bill
[1:03:41] getting the people together in
[1:03:43] worshipping men just encouraging them in
[1:03:47] unity and brother Pete is the first
[1:03:49] pastor who actually was one to the Lord
[1:03:55] he and his congregation from the mystery
[1:03:59] expose and you know brother Owen and
[1:04:03] we're quick to tell us there's been a
[1:04:04] lot of things that they've learned over
[1:04:06] the time on how to approach things you
[1:04:08] know even here after so here's just some
[1:04:10] of the a little bit more of the pictures
[1:04:12] kind of get you a little bit of a
[1:04:14] setting brother all's churches right
[1:04:15] there so this is this is a the the
[1:04:18] desire they had is so that they could be
[1:04:21] able to have venues here they hold a
[1:04:22] December convention that is about four I
[1:04:24] think four or five days long and they're
[1:04:26] able with the different facilities that
[1:04:29] are in here to actually feed the
[1:04:31] believers as well when they come so
[1:04:35] there's this is the the Ida tribal
[1:04:38] believers which brother Oh Ella those of
[1:04:39] you they were here on that Thursday he
[1:04:41] spoke about those those from the Ida
[1:04:44] tribe that was up there near Mount
[1:04:47] Pinatubo and the reestablishment of that
[1:04:50] in that place this is the group of
[1:04:52] believers right here those that have
[1:04:55] traveled and some of them
[1:04:56] travelled and they're not you know they
[1:04:59] haven't embraced the the word as of yet
[1:05:03] but but they came this is the pastor
[1:05:05] right here now there is a there is a
[1:05:09] lady who was in here and I don't know
[1:05:13] she has you know I don't think she's
[1:05:16] fully embraced the message but she is
[1:05:18] technically under title the pastor but
[1:05:22] right now really in reality he is that
[1:05:26] the brother here is the pastor and
[1:05:28] through this they introduced us after
[1:05:30] the service all of the tribal council
[1:05:32] they have their order so I was getting
[1:05:34] introduced to all the different tribal
[1:05:36] orders that are among that are among
[1:05:38] them so it's just a wonderful work that
[1:05:41] the Lord is doing there it's a very very
[1:05:43] fresh work that is taking place there
[1:05:46] and brothers are going in there the we
[1:05:49] had a service there for the Royals then
[1:05:51] the following night on Thursday we
[1:05:54] administered there and then Saturday the
[1:05:58] young people had a convention they had
[1:06:02] been having a retreat right after this
[1:06:03] time but brother royal and them just
[1:06:05] didn't have the the strength to do it
[1:06:07] but the young people were pressing them
[1:06:09] so we had a we had a service there with
[1:06:13] the young people and just um just a
[1:06:15] wonderful wonderful time in the Lord
[1:06:17] just to see how that the Lord would
[1:06:19] would touch and and deal with with
[1:06:22] hearts and lives and you know they face
[1:06:24] they face the same pressures and things
[1:06:28] that that that we do a lot of times you
[1:06:31] have things that were because I'm
[1:06:34] because when I'm ministering here I'm
[1:06:36] ministry you know you've got I don't
[1:06:39] want to say exactly all ages but there
[1:06:40] was there was some that was even a
[1:06:43] little bit older that we're in there but
[1:06:44] you have young people that are really
[1:06:48] they become very occupied you know the
[1:06:51] the college and things like that a lot
[1:06:54] of those things are stressed which is
[1:06:55] fine but sometimes with all of the the
[1:06:58] pressures and the tension and you think
[1:06:59] about it many of these young people when
[1:07:01] I talk to them if they're commuting back
[1:07:03] and forth to college they have a normal
[1:07:06] day but then they have a three hour or
[1:07:09] four
[1:07:10] our commute at the beginning and a three
[1:07:11] hour four hour commute at the end of the
[1:07:13] day so most of their day is just so it's
[1:07:16] busy and then when their occupation then
[1:07:18] they work into a city and so forth so
[1:07:20] there's a there's a lot of pressure
[1:07:21] sometimes and sometimes you know there's
[1:07:23] things that the focus of the hour can
[1:07:26] become clouded in the midst of things
[1:07:28] but God is merciful and we were so
[1:07:32] thankful to God that God you know it
[1:07:35] helps us when we would anything would
[1:07:36] get out of balance so just a wonderful
[1:07:38] time with them after this we went on
[1:07:41] Sunday morning brother Jerry stayed
[1:07:43] there in Manila and spoke to another Rho
[1:07:46] elz assembly on the morning and I
[1:07:48] traveled from over here tight I was
[1:07:52] about right there where brother owns
[1:07:53] churches and I traveled to brass and at
[1:07:57] brass you remember brother Oh L
[1:07:59] mentioned but he didn't show you
[1:08:00] pictures of where that this is the the
[1:08:04] congregation of believers where the
[1:08:06] government came in and took the land
[1:08:09] that had been theirs for years and not
[1:08:13] just talking about a few years but under
[1:08:15] a Homestead Act that was there in that
[1:08:16] place after five years that land belongs
[1:08:19] to you you farm it you settle it it
[1:08:21] belongs to you
[1:08:22] many of these believers it's been there
[1:08:25] within their families for some 35 37
[1:08:29] years and the government came in and
[1:08:31] took and confiscated many of the
[1:08:33] believers homes the property as well as
[1:08:35] the church and they tore those down I'll
[1:08:38] show you pictures in a moment here but
[1:08:39] this is an area that when brother oels
[1:08:41] shared that with me at my house here in
[1:08:43] august it really had touched my heart
[1:08:45] but i had no idea that i would get a
[1:08:47] chance to go in and and be with the
[1:08:50] church here brother Oh Alan the brother
[1:08:52] Alan the pastor he was with us the whole
[1:08:54] time when we were there in the
[1:08:56] Philippines so we got a chance to go
[1:08:58] there and you see right here this is a
[1:09:00] little place they've rented now this all
[1:09:02] of this back in here is government
[1:09:04] housing and there's things that has that
[1:09:07] have taken place where because these
[1:09:09] believers were displaced then you have
[1:09:11] people in the surrounding areas
[1:09:13] obviously the rental fees and things
[1:09:16] like that they're going to charge more
[1:09:18] now because they know there's people
[1:09:20] that's displaced
[1:09:22] so they're they're paying to rent this
[1:09:26] little space right here and you know it
[1:09:31] was a little space but here's the thing
[1:09:32] I did get up on brother Jerry
[1:09:34] well Jerry preached in Manila and
[1:09:35] brother Rho elz that day but when I met
[1:09:37] him later that evening I said I want you
[1:09:39] to know I said there's one little thing
[1:09:41] I had that you didn't have he said
[1:09:44] what's that if I preached in a sea this
[1:09:46] morning that was good because I had to
[1:09:55] go and preach right after that I had to
[1:09:56] travel and preach that night and didn't
[1:09:58] have too much time in between so here we
[1:10:00] are
[1:10:01] and then here's the pastor brother Alan
[1:10:04] of the assembly brother Alan is 41 years
[1:10:07] old really has a real real burden for
[1:10:12] the congregation there this behind here
[1:10:14] is where they have all their instruments
[1:10:15] I'll show you a picture here looking out
[1:10:17] from I'm standing around the front front
[1:10:20] pew and you can see the little the the
[1:10:22] space that they have those are the clear
[1:10:23] doors that I had showed you before and
[1:10:26] you get a chance to look at the
[1:10:27] congregation here just a little bit and
[1:10:33] just a just a very lovely group of
[1:10:35] people then here they before I travel to
[1:10:39] the - to the island for this evening
[1:10:41] service they wanted me to to eat here
[1:10:44] with them and just just wonderful
[1:10:48] wonderful people wonderful brothers and
[1:10:50] sisters and you know to see it when this
[1:10:52] when some of these things took place
[1:10:54] right here with the people let me just
[1:10:57] show you this is some of the property
[1:10:59] there the government you know put the
[1:11:02] wire up all of this property up in here
[1:11:04] this was seized by the government and
[1:11:07] you know brother Alan when all this was
[1:11:11] taking place brother Alan obviously the
[1:11:13] pastor was their brother Rowell came
[1:11:15] down at that time - because you had
[1:11:16] brothers probably understand it this is
[1:11:20] your family heritage for 30-some years
[1:11:23] so they got out the things with bullets
[1:11:27] and brother Alan and brother Oh l said
[1:11:30] hey you know
[1:11:32] because the government's taken
[1:11:34] everything they've got so by God's grace
[1:11:38] you know they were able to to speak to
[1:11:42] the brother and you know and and to see
[1:11:44] just a change of events it's not to say
[1:11:46] that there's not things that don't
[1:11:47] bother them and you know because there's
[1:11:50] a great thing that has taken place but
[1:11:52] it just such a wonderful atmosphere when
[1:11:55] we gathered there that morning with them
[1:11:58] and just ministering the word of the
[1:12:00] Lord to encourage him it's just such a
[1:12:02] wonderful atmosphere and the fellowship
[1:12:03] afterwards you didn't detect any
[1:12:05] bitterness no bitterness there's no
[1:12:09] doubt they went through their time and
[1:12:10] there's no doubt that they go through
[1:12:11] their battles but you know what out of
[1:12:13] it all it's like when brother or brother
[1:12:15] Alan told me after that service because
[1:12:17] there's some things that I had just felt
[1:12:19] on my heart just to preach from my heart
[1:12:20] was just some little things and brother
[1:12:23] Alan's that you know he said I have I
[1:12:25] communicated to the people he said that
[1:12:27] in this I don't understand why I don't
[1:12:30] have the answer he said but there's
[1:12:32] something that God has out of this if
[1:12:34] God allowed this to be able to happen
[1:12:36] and just a little bit more of the
[1:12:39] pictures here I this up in here there's
[1:12:41] this little white thing that so anything
[1:12:44] brother Alan could point out to me that
[1:12:45] is just one of the walls or one of the
[1:12:47] places of the church but all these
[1:12:50] things in here these are believers
[1:12:51] houses that they just they came in and
[1:12:55] torn down a thing that they find out is
[1:12:58] obviously on the next on the other side
[1:13:00] of the hill the the guy who's developing
[1:13:03] it for a development well you've got to
[1:13:06] have a nice
[1:13:07] certain right away then there has to be
[1:13:09] an entrance into that development so you
[1:13:11] need a clear entranceway so their
[1:13:14] property lay in the way so you know you
[1:13:19] know how things how things work within
[1:13:22] that that the reality is really what's
[1:13:24] behind it all is because there's
[1:13:26] somebody who owns some property behind
[1:13:28] there and then you have everything
[1:13:29] taking place with the government so then
[1:13:31] they take the land the person behind it
[1:13:33] has the
[1:13:33] but God is in control your Lord is in
[1:13:36] control this right here is what they
[1:13:38] showed me they did show me there is a
[1:13:40] property that are inquiring about I
[1:13:42] couldn't get a real good shot this is
[1:13:44] after the service after we've eaten it's
[1:13:46] it's a land right out in here in its
[1:13:48] land that's out from this out here in
[1:13:51] the country here's another little bit
[1:13:52] better shot of it and it's land that
[1:13:55] they're inquiring to purchase for for
[1:13:59] the Saints and for the church the idea
[1:14:01] and the thought line that brother o/l
[1:14:03] has and they're working to bring the
[1:14:06] pastors together over there is that this
[1:14:08] land to purchase this land and then
[1:14:11] allow this land to become not only a
[1:14:13] place where they can build the church
[1:14:14] but believers can build their homes
[1:14:16] there and they can also be a campground
[1:14:19] for them to have their camp meetings but
[1:14:21] it'll be a place for the brothers and
[1:14:22] sisters who are displaced because
[1:14:24] virtually all of them that you've seen
[1:14:26] in that picture in that congregation are
[1:14:28] displaced there just but they are
[1:14:30] farmers they know how to go into a land
[1:14:32] develop a land so that's what they're
[1:14:35] looking at that it would be an
[1:14:36] investment for the believers but also be
[1:14:39] a place where that they can come
[1:14:41] together in a camp meeting from there
[1:14:44] we tried traveled we traveled down here
[1:14:47] and I'm gonna go to this island that
[1:14:49] evening or the jury's coming down he's
[1:14:51] gonna meet me and I'm coming from this
[1:14:53] way and we're gonna go to that island
[1:14:55] that evening in Liam Island and right
[1:14:59] just in relation you're Manila's over
[1:15:02] here this is Metro Manila and here is
[1:15:05] tule Milam your we're traveling travel
[1:15:09] to that island and just a little above
[1:15:12] above the scope shot here of the island
[1:15:16] see looking down on it one of the things
[1:15:19] that brother Jerry and and my dad they
[1:15:24] had come together when my dad was still
[1:15:26] daddy still passed me and they had come
[1:15:27] together and there was a brother who was
[1:15:29] pastoring in this congregation that I
[1:15:31] went to that they purchased a boat for
[1:15:33] him that he could do evangelism and most
[1:15:36] year a lot of you older ones here to the
[1:15:39] assembly remember that they purchased
[1:15:41] that that boat so there could be
[1:15:42] evangelism that would done that pastor
[1:15:45] has has moved
[1:15:46] but there's a pastor that's right here
[1:15:48] brother ven who was with us throughout
[1:15:49] the whole trip and brother ven
[1:15:53] evangelizes this whole island he and
[1:15:56] some others with him but you know
[1:15:57] they're walking over you know the
[1:16:00] mountain getting back and forth and so
[1:16:03] it takes a lot of time for them to get
[1:16:06] to certain places whereas if there was a
[1:16:08] boat involved that they could actually
[1:16:11] get into some things brother then let me
[1:16:13] know that there are brothers in the
[1:16:15] church that can build a boat from
[1:16:19] fiberglass they have that they have that
[1:16:21] skill in craftsman and I think that
[1:16:23] where he had told me I have it down in
[1:16:25] my notes somewhere but it's somewhere
[1:16:27] between 2,000 and 3,000 dollars where
[1:16:29] they're actually able to do that and
[1:16:31] build that boat to where he'd be able to
[1:16:33] get around on the island and for the
[1:16:35] poor evangelizing he's doing it anyhow
[1:16:38] he's doing it he's walking he's not it
[1:16:41] doesn't have a motorbike or nothing he's
[1:16:43] walking so he's doing it and it's
[1:16:47] getting done here we are traveling we're
[1:16:49] gonna we're traveling on a on a boat
[1:16:51] boarding the boat and here we are we've
[1:16:54] all met up and going over to the island
[1:16:57] and I have to tell this on the way to
[1:17:02] preach that morning brother Alan tells
[1:17:04] me says the other the Sammis edifice I
[1:17:06] got in contact with brother VIN you know
[1:17:08] over at the island he said everything's
[1:17:10] good to go for this evening I said okay
[1:17:12] wonderful you know and he said but you
[1:17:14] know it's our asked him about the
[1:17:16] weather he said because there's currents
[1:17:17] in that Lake I asked him you know how is
[1:17:19] everything going you know with the with
[1:17:20] the currents in the lake and he said
[1:17:22] brother Vince said everything is
[1:17:23] wonderful and he said what it is he said
[1:17:25] there is a boat he said there was
[1:17:27] capsized here just the first part of the
[1:17:29] week and 20 people just lost their lives
[1:17:36] so I just you know by God's grace I just
[1:17:39] focus on so my lord you know you you
[1:17:41] directed that we would go to this island
[1:17:43] tonight you'll make away well come to
[1:17:45] find out later on it wasn't that there
[1:17:47] was some problem with the boat the
[1:17:50] problem was is you had 20 people on the
[1:17:52] boat who wanted to go to one side and
[1:17:54] take a selfie and because they went to
[1:18:00] one side and took a selfie the boat
[1:18:03] capsized and they lost their life in the
[1:18:06] lake so needless to say you see that you
[1:18:11] see everybody sitting we were ensuring
[1:18:14] everybody was sitting spread out but the
[1:18:16] captains were as well looking into this
[1:18:19] so here we are getting ready to we're
[1:18:22] getting ready to approach the island
[1:18:23] coming into the island here and then we
[1:18:28] made our way up to to the church as soon
[1:18:32] as we got off the boat you know we had
[1:18:34] to get there because the service has
[1:18:35] already started and brother o-l just
[1:18:38] points to me he says look well the jury
[1:18:39] and I are gonna take this tricycle you
[1:18:42] know they're gonna be able to ride but
[1:18:43] the jury's gonna be able to ride you
[1:18:45] know next to the motorcycle and brother
[1:18:46] where I was gonna ride in the back and
[1:18:48] he's her brother Samuel jump on that
[1:18:49] motorcycle right there and looked at let
[1:18:51] that brother take you on up there you
[1:18:54] know it isn't like you ride a motorcycle
[1:18:55] every day so I grab on to the back the
[1:18:59] brother
[1:19:00] I've got water bottles in this hand the
[1:19:01] only thing I could do is just hold on
[1:19:03] with this hand in the backpack one of
[1:19:06] the brothers grabbed the backpack and
[1:19:07] they rode me up up the hill and over the
[1:19:09] speed bumps I just think the Lord we
[1:19:11] made it there but the brother that was
[1:19:13] driving was very gracious he didn't try
[1:19:16] to really rock it over those speed bumps
[1:19:17] but when we came in here I wish I would
[1:19:20] have had more pictures of the brothers
[1:19:22] and sisters singing in this church
[1:19:25] because I just I got off the motorcycle
[1:19:27] everything has to start rolling and
[1:19:29] brother Jerry took some pictures at
[1:19:31] times but this little church there has
[1:19:34] been a lot of change that's taken place
[1:19:36] physically to the church since brother
[1:19:39] Jerry and dad were there years ago and
[1:19:42] one of the things the pulpit area used
[1:19:43] to be right here so they turned the
[1:19:45] church around and the
[1:19:46] brother who's the pastor there brother
[1:19:48] VIN right now brother VIN has done a lot
[1:19:50] of work physically in the building as
[1:19:52] well as evangelizing but I want you to
[1:19:54] see this I want you to see this right
[1:19:55] here I'm sure some of you noticed this
[1:19:57] as this caught my attention as I sit
[1:19:59] there on the front row and I looked at
[1:20:01] this here's the offering tithe and a
[1:20:04] mission fund mission fund to go forth in
[1:20:10] that Island this here it's you know
[1:20:14] obviously not that you know anyone's
[1:20:16] more wealthy than anyone but it's it's
[1:20:18] obvious that when you come to the island
[1:20:20] here you go out into the outskirts away
[1:20:22] from Manila and so forth you things
[1:20:25] change drastically change drastically so
[1:20:29] things really really change from here
[1:20:32] the next we went back to Manila that
[1:20:35] night and then we went into old Metro
[1:20:38] Manila this they held a ministers
[1:20:40] meeting there at brother Nestor's church
[1:20:43] and for the Giri spoken and I put a
[1:20:47] picture so you can kind of see just it's
[1:20:49] pretty pretty good-sized so that they
[1:20:51] can hold the ministers and once again I
[1:20:53] wish I would have had a better picture
[1:20:55] because they feed the ministers when
[1:20:57] they come in there and those ministers
[1:20:58] come once a month and they all get
[1:21:00] together and then they talk about
[1:21:03] different topics and things like that
[1:21:06] and the word and a lot of things are are
[1:21:09] even centered around especially some of
[1:21:11] the the newer ones that are coming in
[1:21:12] and certain things that they are
[1:21:15] discussing and speaking about so it's a
[1:21:17] wonderful it was really wonderful time
[1:21:19] that we had there and then here we are
[1:21:25] this is right we traveled back to
[1:21:27] brother oels place and this isn't his
[1:21:31] whole place one of these I think that
[1:21:33] right in here we'd come in here and this
[1:21:34] is brother oels place right here and
[1:21:37] when we went there to his house right
[1:21:39] right the night before we departed and
[1:21:42] come back home but overall I certainly
[1:21:45] want to say we certainly appreciate it
[1:21:47] your prayers and you could sense it when
[1:21:51] we were there and I really mean that
[1:21:53] because you know when you're sometimes
[1:21:56] this was this this particular time was a
[1:21:59] little different for me
[1:22:00] and some of the times that previous when
[1:22:03] I went to Mexico here just two years ago
[1:22:05] and then the other two times I went into
[1:22:06] to Africa I was I went in there and I
[1:22:09] just went in and we did it did a
[1:22:11] convention so you know you're able just
[1:22:13] to be right there in your room you're
[1:22:15] kind of by yourself but when you're in
[1:22:16] and out here on these things you know
[1:22:18] you're interacting with people
[1:22:19] constantly you don't have a whole lot of
[1:22:21] a long time you got to be ready to go
[1:22:24] and there's things that you know God was
[1:22:27] just really really merciful to us and I
[1:22:30] believe that I know we were refreshed
[1:22:33] even though tired and body but refreshed
[1:22:35] in spirit and the people were were
[1:22:38] really were edified in the word of the
[1:22:41] Lord and I just want to say we certainly
[1:22:44] appreciated your prayers I you know
[1:22:46] sometimes you you look and think my I
[1:22:48] wonder what the reports will come by and
[1:22:50] where we will stand someday to be able
[1:22:53] you know to know what what happened in a
[1:22:56] certain meeting what happened in a
[1:22:57] certain time you you know you because
[1:23:00] sometimes we just don't see or as far as
[1:23:02] half verbally the things communicated to
[1:23:05] us but you know what God is in control
[1:23:08] he is in control so it just had some
[1:23:11] wonderful services there so my I think
[1:23:15] I've taken almost all of my time but can
[1:23:17] I have about 30 minutes communion
[1:23:21] service is until 3:30 so let's just
[1:23:25] maybe change our position here and let's
[1:23:29] stand
[1:23:37] you can go ahead and turn it off of that
[1:23:39] sister let's go to first John chapter
[1:23:42] one
[1:23:55] bless you
[1:24:09] verse 1 in John first John chapter 1
[1:24:19] that which was from the beginning which
[1:24:22] we have heard which we have seen with
[1:24:24] our eyes which we have looked upon and
[1:24:26] our hands have handled of the word of
[1:24:28] life where the life was manifested and
[1:24:31] we have seen it and bear witness and
[1:24:33] show unto you that eternal life which
[1:24:36] was with the father and was manifested
[1:24:37] unto us that which we have seen and
[1:24:41] heard declare we unto you that you may
[1:24:45] also have fellowship with us and truly
[1:24:49] our Fellowship is with the father and
[1:24:52] with his son Jesus Christ and these
[1:24:55] things right we unto you that your joy
[1:24:58] may be full
[1:25:00] this then is the message which we have
[1:25:03] heard of him and declare unto you that
[1:25:04] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:25:07] at all if we say we have fellowship with
[1:25:10] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[1:25:13] not the truth but if we walk in the
[1:25:16] light as he is in the light we have
[1:25:18] fellowship one with another and the
[1:25:20] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
[1:25:23] us from all sin let's just bow our heads
[1:25:27] Heavenly Father
[1:25:28] Lord Jesus we we love you lord
[1:25:31] we're so thankful for your mercy Lord
[1:25:34] you're gone just as we Lord would look
[1:25:37] into your word here for a few moments
[1:25:39] alone I pray that God that you'll just
[1:25:41] anoint us together Lord and may you just
[1:25:44] speak to our hearts words that Lord
[1:25:46] would Lord encourage which strengthen
[1:25:49] and Lord would Lord minister to the
[1:25:52] depths of our life Lord Father we just
[1:25:54] give ourselves to you Lord and ask that
[1:25:57] you would just have your way in the name
[1:25:59] of Jesus Christ amen god bless you may
[1:26:02] be seated I want to I want to look here
[1:26:08] just to take a little thought here and
[1:26:14] dealing with the things that we have
[1:26:17] been looking at with the new birth with
[1:26:20] that of election and my heart was just
[1:26:24] drawn to here over the past times in in
[1:26:30] thinking of even the approach to the
[1:26:32] service that we have here this evening
[1:26:33] into the communion service and to
[1:26:38] realize that what that we have set
[1:26:41] before us it's not something that we are
[1:26:44] coming to do out of a mirror out of a
[1:26:47] tradition and frankly even in our lives
[1:26:51] if we're just coming to church and it's
[1:26:54] just merely just out of tradition we're
[1:26:56] truly missing the goal and the desire of
[1:26:59] what God has for us
[1:27:01] you know you can people can go to gather
[1:27:05] in many places faithfully they can
[1:27:07] gather in lodges they can gather in
[1:27:09] meetings things that take place even
[1:27:11] around educational environments and
[1:27:13] other things they can be very faithful
[1:27:14] in doing that but serving the Lord and
[1:27:17] coming to the house of God it's not
[1:27:20] about us just coming to perform a duty
[1:27:23] serving the Lord is not performing a
[1:27:25] duty but it is God's desire is that we
[1:27:28] would serve Him from the depths of our
[1:27:31] heart that it's not something that it's
[1:27:33] were required to do but it's that which
[1:27:35] is done from the very love of God moving
[1:27:38] in our hearts that what he has done for
[1:27:41] us by the way that he has made for us
[1:27:44] that that is so gripped our hearts and
[1:27:46] our life then now through us what's
[1:27:48] reflected back to him is the same love
[1:27:51] that he has expressed to us and so only
[1:27:55] think of this in terms of the scripture
[1:27:58] the thought that I was just just looking
[1:28:00] at and just weighing upon my heart is
[1:28:03] that of blessed fellowship you think of
[1:28:06] fellowship one of the words of a
[1:28:08] fellowship and meaning when you would
[1:28:10] take of one of it it's a joint
[1:28:12] participation it's things to where
[1:28:14] people share a common interest a common
[1:28:17] goal there's things that you know when
[1:28:19] you have a meeting sometimes it's your
[1:28:21] job or you have certain places and you
[1:28:23] have maybe different committees people
[1:28:25] come together and the people who are on
[1:28:27] there are supposed to have the same
[1:28:30] purpose and being there you know you're
[1:28:34] not gonna meet there and talk about
[1:28:35] something else but there's the same
[1:28:36] there's a common goal there's a common
[1:28:38] vision there's a common burden and I
[1:28:41] believe that that's that's the unction
[1:28:43] of what the Holy Spirit draw
[1:28:45] calls us together as believers is that
[1:28:47] it draws us beyond just the living in
[1:28:51] this life we know we have to live and
[1:28:53] walk in this life but it brings us to a
[1:28:55] reality that this earth itself this
[1:28:58] world the world that we know it's not
[1:29:01] our home
[1:29:02] but we are Pilgrims and we are strangers
[1:29:05] without God moving across our path we we
[1:29:08] would be as as anyone else we would have
[1:29:11] and hold the same goals and the same
[1:29:13] things where they're trying to turn this
[1:29:15] around and try to turn that around but
[1:29:16] by the grace of God the sovereignty of
[1:29:18] God him moving within our hearts then as
[1:29:21] were assembled together for one purpose
[1:29:23] and that is the that's the objective
[1:29:25] that God would bring down through the
[1:29:28] ages is that we have one hope we have
[1:29:30] one desire and that's for the coming of
[1:29:33] the Lord we want to live daily pleasing
[1:29:36] to the Lord we look and we live for his
[1:29:39] coming that's everything that that we do
[1:29:42] he's living for his coming and I I think
[1:29:44] of that term of fellowship because one
[1:29:47] of the one of the meanings within that
[1:29:49] or a word that you can draw from and is
[1:29:51] the very word communion itself and
[1:29:54] communion is a very very precious thing
[1:29:56] you know you communion is where as the
[1:30:00] definition would say it's it's a sharing
[1:30:02] or an exchanging of intimate thoughts
[1:30:05] it's it's it's it's personal it's things
[1:30:08] that can be spoken and it's received and
[1:30:11] you know it's just like in this right
[1:30:13] here right here well we're gathered and
[1:30:15] in this particular part of the service
[1:30:17] this part of the service here you're
[1:30:19] listening you're taking in but in your
[1:30:22] life when in my life when we walk out of
[1:30:25] these doors and in a daily that's when
[1:30:28] we enter in further into communion
[1:30:31] because God is not interested in just
[1:30:33] speaking he wants you and I had to speak
[1:30:36] back to him God wants to have fellowship
[1:30:39] with you and I that's and that's the
[1:30:42] desire that that God has and so to see
[1:30:45] that that that communion in that desire
[1:30:47] because fellowship itself is a very very
[1:30:50] precious thing you know the Prophet
[1:30:52] tells us that within fellowship there is
[1:30:54] protection we find that within in
[1:30:57] fellowship
[1:30:58] it's a wonderful thing because God
[1:31:00] himself desired fellowship and he still
[1:31:03] desires fellowship think of it that even
[1:31:06] prior to the fall and Eden of how that
[1:31:08] God would make an appointment to come
[1:31:11] down and visit with his children and it
[1:31:14] wasn't just a passing by visit that God
[1:31:17] was meaningful and purposeful that he
[1:31:20] would come down at a designated time and
[1:31:22] that time was totally set aside to come
[1:31:26] down and to fellowship with Adam and
[1:31:28] with Eve
[1:31:29] then we won't realize and we understand
[1:31:32] of how that after that there was a
[1:31:34] there's a break in that fellowship there
[1:31:37] is an interruption within that
[1:31:39] fellowship you find that how that God
[1:31:41] himself even when God dwelt alone before
[1:31:44] the Garden of Eden before that Adam was
[1:31:47] ever here but God was dwelling alone and
[1:31:50] he desired fellowship you know you know
[1:31:52] when you flying this God even having the
[1:31:55] portrayal of where that he would look at
[1:31:57] Adam and he would look into Adam and God
[1:32:00] was even seeing himself there within
[1:32:02] Adam for he said it's not good for man
[1:32:04] to dwell alone it was that yet what was
[1:32:07] what had a need and then what he was
[1:32:09] longing for and what would satisfy what
[1:32:12] God could see in him is something that
[1:32:15] dwelt within him and it would take God
[1:32:18] to bring that forth that's the same
[1:32:20] thing with God himself there is nothing
[1:32:23] that could satisfy what he was longing
[1:32:25] for outside of his own family being
[1:32:30] expressed that he could communicate with
[1:32:32] his family sure we find the a wonderful
[1:32:37] development of how God here bringing in
[1:32:40] the Stars and all of the the planets and
[1:32:42] all those things but God couldn't
[1:32:43] fellowship with stars
[1:32:45] he couldn't fellowship with planets all
[1:32:47] of the wonderful things that he he
[1:32:49] writes it there in the heavens but yet
[1:32:51] God couldn't fellowship with those with
[1:32:53] those wonderful those things but God can
[1:32:56] only fellowship with that which is of is
[1:32:58] kind so how that God himself think of it
[1:33:02] of how that in the the Garden of Eden
[1:33:05] after the news had come of the fall how
[1:33:09] that God himself God make
[1:33:12] so Wayne when Adam and Eve are unable to
[1:33:15] stand in his presence God makes away
[1:33:18] that they would be able to come and to
[1:33:22] stand in his presence they could not
[1:33:24] make their own way but God took that of
[1:33:29] an innocent one he took from me took
[1:33:32] that of the skins God here he slays an
[1:33:35] innocent one and throws those skins back
[1:33:37] in there that they can be covered by the
[1:33:40] clothing of one that's from an innocent
[1:33:43] one God was letting them know that
[1:33:45] there's only one thing that can take
[1:33:47] away the guilt there's got to be an
[1:33:49] innocent one come and that innocent one
[1:33:53] remove the guilt it's just where God
[1:33:56] himself in order to bring you and I back
[1:33:58] to himself as the Prophet tells us in
[1:34:01] the message token he says God had to get
[1:34:03] himself back a son again
[1:34:05] God had to to create God had to bring
[1:34:08] forth that of a blood cell and and come
[1:34:11] forth with a blood that was separated
[1:34:13] from that which was already here because
[1:34:15] it could not be a polluted blood no
[1:34:17] matter how many righteous men that ever
[1:34:20] had lived there was none of them that
[1:34:22] could sufficiently pay the price that
[1:34:25] would bring you and I back into
[1:34:26] fellowship as innocent as the blood of
[1:34:29] bulls and goats and those of the animal
[1:34:31] life truly they were innocent but yet
[1:34:33] none of them could restore the
[1:34:35] fellowship that God intended to have yet
[1:34:38] God could communicate he would speak
[1:34:40] many times to the prophets and different
[1:34:42] ones but yet it was not the fellowship
[1:34:45] that of the perfect fellowship that God
[1:34:47] desired and wanted to have but God would
[1:34:51] make a way for that to think of how that
[1:34:52] you know that the Prophet would would
[1:34:55] place it you know when we look at the
[1:34:57] great intercessory prayer that takes
[1:34:59] place here's the Lord Jesus standing
[1:35:01] upon earth here the the very one holding
[1:35:05] within him the very price that is
[1:35:08] required for redemption only he can do
[1:35:10] it and define here the very heart of God
[1:35:13] is expressed in an intercessory prayer
[1:35:16] in John 17 he says neither pray I for
[1:35:20] these alone but for them also
[1:35:23] which shall believe on me through their
[1:35:25] word that they all may be one as thou
[1:35:28] father art in me and I in thee that they
[1:35:30] also may be one in us that the world may
[1:35:33] believe that thou has sent me and the
[1:35:35] glory which thou gave us me I have given
[1:35:38] them that they may be one even as we are
[1:35:41] high in them thou and me that they may
[1:35:44] be perfect in one and that the world may
[1:35:47] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[1:35:50] me as thou has loved them as thou has
[1:35:54] loved me father I will that they also
[1:35:56] whom Dallas given me be with me where I
[1:36:00] am that they may behold my glory which
[1:36:03] thou has given me for thou lovest me
[1:36:06] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:09] this intercessory prayer when we could
[1:36:12] look just even from the beginning of it
[1:36:14] and you can take even from the
[1:36:16] scriptures they them they them they that
[1:36:19] there is an intended audience for this
[1:36:23] there is that there is the here the
[1:36:26] desire that is within it all that thou
[1:36:28] hast given me those which are ordained
[1:36:33] to that life that are a part of God and
[1:36:36] were always a part of God and here this
[1:36:38] intercessory prayer is that there would
[1:36:41] be a union you see this is God's desire
[1:36:45] coming forth it was always God's desire
[1:36:48] for this fellowship to come God God
[1:36:51] displays this when here through the life
[1:36:53] of the Lord Jesus God moves and he
[1:36:56] claims back that body that he has
[1:36:58] created he redeems that body back at the
[1:37:01] River Jordan and declares this is my son
[1:37:05] it wasn't that the holy ghost me made
[1:37:08] him the son of God he already was the
[1:37:10] son of God just like the Holy Ghost does
[1:37:13] not make you a son of God or the
[1:37:15] daughter of God it only declares you
[1:37:17] always were a son or daughter of God
[1:37:20] so the intercessory prayer this is that
[1:37:24] if we can say it like this
[1:37:26] it's a prayer where a mom and dad would
[1:37:29] have for their own children they would
[1:37:31] have a desire that their children would
[1:37:33] be saved would be
[1:37:34] filled with the Spirit of God that their
[1:37:36] eyes would be open that they would be
[1:37:38] walking in the truth that is the same
[1:37:40] intercessory prayer of how that the Lord
[1:37:43] Jesus he's praying here for the family
[1:37:47] of God he's pray for the elect jeans of
[1:37:50] Almighty God and we realize because of
[1:37:53] the fall
[1:37:54] there are many that enter in it's not
[1:37:57] just where there is going to there is
[1:38:00] coming for just elect children but there
[1:38:03] are many who are coming forth no not
[1:38:05] elect but still they can be saved here
[1:38:11] is that right so here within this prayer
[1:38:15] look how the Prophet places that hearing
[1:38:18] things that ought to be he says Jesus
[1:38:20] only asked for one thing in his prayer
[1:38:22] to the Father one thing after all his
[1:38:25] sacrifice that he did it on earth the
[1:38:27] life that he lived the path that he
[1:38:29] walked he asked for one thing that where
[1:38:31] I am they may be also he asked for our
[1:38:35] fellowship I don't know about you but
[1:38:38] this every time I'm listening to this I
[1:38:41] read across this it always grips my
[1:38:43] heart because to think of it in the
[1:38:45] midst of everything that is facing him
[1:38:49] in this time he asked for our fellowship
[1:38:53] this was the intercessory prayer and I
[1:38:56] believe we're always in the mind of God
[1:38:58] always in tomb and God when were praying
[1:39:01] for harmony among the children of God I
[1:39:04] believe we're always in tune with God's
[1:39:05] mind when we're saying Lord let the
[1:39:07] bonds of fellowship Lord be strengthened
[1:39:10] Lord in our hearts Lord God let your
[1:39:12] word Lord let it let my let our life
[1:39:14] Lord anything within me that is
[1:39:16] hindering the connection Lord let it be
[1:39:19] purged from my life that's coming in
[1:39:21] line with that intercessory prayer
[1:39:23] because this prayer this intercessory
[1:39:25] prayer it is not without fulfillment it
[1:39:28] has been being fulfilled down through
[1:39:30] the ages and this prayer right here
[1:39:33] that's being pray was not a new prayer
[1:39:35] this is echoed from the mind of God
[1:39:37] there was already intercession that was
[1:39:40] made for you and I before there was Adam
[1:39:43] Stardust or molecule
[1:39:45] the lamb was slain in the mind of God
[1:39:47] before the foundation of the world he's
[1:39:49] coming in contact with the intercessory
[1:39:52] that took place Oh glory that's why when
[1:39:55] God sends a message every time God sends
[1:39:57] a message it's God it's the Spirit of
[1:40:00] God moving in intercessory to that age
[1:40:03] standing out there with the aged and the
[1:40:05] darkness and things are Craig Croce and
[1:40:07] coming upon it but God can take a vessel
[1:40:10] in his hand and that vessel surrendered
[1:40:12] to God begins to cry out not that the
[1:40:15] age would turn around but that that
[1:40:17] which is of God within that age would be
[1:40:20] gathered unto the Lord is that right
[1:40:24] think of how the prophet standing in the
[1:40:26] message indictment and how that even at
[1:40:28] the end of that message and here the
[1:40:30] indictment has come of where that the
[1:40:32] people have the churches have rejected
[1:40:35] the very resurrected Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:38] and he stands there at the end of that
[1:40:40] message in his own life he's he's
[1:40:42] recovering he's he's clearing out over
[1:40:45] those courses of messages that are there
[1:40:47] a complex of something in his life and
[1:40:49] he's asking God when he stands right
[1:40:51] there for mercy for those who are still
[1:40:54] caught in those systems and tell you
[1:40:56] that was not that was not just a man but
[1:40:59] God had been able to get such an in tune
[1:41:02] such a love such a desire that it would
[1:41:04] see that those who are ensnared in their
[1:41:07] Lord God deliver them I'm telling you
[1:41:10] friends I'm glad there was one who stood
[1:41:13] and prayed for me aren't you glad he
[1:41:16] meant under the inspiration of God
[1:41:18] I'm glad tonight huh and you know I'm
[1:41:20] not gonna stay long I just got to get
[1:41:22] this off because I don't want to sweat
[1:41:23] this shirt up but I'm glad that there
[1:41:26] was an accesory prayer that was made
[1:41:29] when I was astray I'm glad there was
[1:41:33] intercessory prayer that even if I'd
[1:41:34] have been sitting in a message church
[1:41:36] I'm glad that was an intercessory prayer
[1:41:38] god quicken his seed Lord light him up
[1:41:41] Lord God Feli what the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:41:43] glad there was intercessory prayer
[1:41:46] seseri prayer sees the need of the hour
[1:41:49] and it moves to call him on the scene
[1:41:51] who alone can fulfill that word and make
[1:41:55] that word come to pass only he can he's
[1:41:57] the high priest of his word Amen I say
[1:42:01] tonight this morning he's still the high
[1:42:03] priest of his word oh yeah glory be to
[1:42:07] God it ain't just for my failures it
[1:42:09] ain't just for my mistakes no he's not
[1:42:11] just a high priest for my failures he's
[1:42:13] a high priest
[1:42:14] one who's able to minister the strength
[1:42:17] that I have meet up in order for that
[1:42:20] word to become flesh in me yes for our
[1:42:24] fellowship my you know my he could have
[1:42:28] he could have he could the Lord Jesus he
[1:42:32] went through friends the the greatest
[1:42:34] things you know as we stood and we've
[1:42:36] looked at that here he went through the
[1:42:38] greatest time of his life but notice
[1:42:41] there was a deliverance as he looks to
[1:42:44] the Lord
[1:42:44] that he's still right here could have
[1:42:47] been talking about everything that was
[1:42:50] gonna be fall him what he knew that God
[1:42:52] had given him strength and here he is in
[1:42:55] the midst of this asking for our
[1:42:57] fellowship Oh God
[1:43:01] that's the only thing he asked the
[1:43:03] Father in prayer your companionship
[1:43:05] forever
[1:43:06] then how much or should we desire him
[1:43:09] you find how that Abraham remember in
[1:43:12] Abraham let me just kind of refer to
[1:43:14] these places Abraham in his own life he
[1:43:17] gets to a place God's showing these
[1:43:19] shadows and types and Abraham is looking
[1:43:21] upon his own house and he sees one
[1:43:22] Eliezer
[1:43:23] but Abraham does not see an heir of his
[1:43:26] own he says one that's born in my house
[1:43:29] is mine heir and God lets him know that
[1:43:33] this Eliezer is not your heir
[1:43:35] but one that will come forth from your
[1:43:39] own loins that will be your heir
[1:43:42] what is God all of this said is moving
[1:43:44] upon Abraham Abraham doesn't know that
[1:43:46] he's acting out of time he doesn't know
[1:43:48] that he's acting out the very desire
[1:43:51] that God had before
[1:43:53] star duster molecule he doesn't realize
[1:43:55] that oh my brother and sister down
[1:43:58] through the time and ages there's things
[1:44:00] about that God even in this time of day
[1:44:02] and age that we live in God's desire is
[1:44:05] being acted out and it's not something
[1:44:08] that is a tight but it is the
[1:44:09] fulfillment of those things that were
[1:44:12] tights but as now made manifest day man
[1:44:16] what was burning upon Abraham's heart
[1:44:18] here and God lets him know that that's
[1:44:21] one from your own bowels that one that
[1:44:25] shall be thine area
[1:44:27] now do you remember that there was Sarah
[1:44:30] she refers she refers Abraham you know
[1:44:35] to her her handmaid and to to Hagar and
[1:44:39] Sarah you know says I perhaps God will
[1:44:42] give me a child by her see Sarah is
[1:44:45] still under the font line of eye it's
[1:44:48] not Sarah Syria she's still operating
[1:44:51] under self and so operating under self
[1:44:55] self has to make the word come to pass
[1:44:58] itself so Sarah puts a suggestion let
[1:45:04] the blonde woman come and let her you
[1:45:06] can see it she conceived and let that
[1:45:09] one be thine heir but that was never
[1:45:12] God's mind I don't care how much
[1:45:14] alterations to the Word of God it's
[1:45:16] never God's mind what God has said in
[1:45:20] his word he will fulfill the right God
[1:45:27] was letting Abraham know that that from
[1:45:30] within you that seed that life that will
[1:45:33] come from out of you and here Hagar she
[1:45:36] she's put there before him and here
[1:45:39] Abraham here his seed is not dried up
[1:45:42] yet are you with me he still has self
[1:45:46] come on somebody see he hasn't reached a
[1:45:49] place of complete deadness oh my
[1:45:54] now I hear the Prophet tell us in the
[1:45:56] message prisoner Jesus Christ
[1:45:57] Oh God he said we need to dine more to
[1:46:01] ourselves he said keep in mind the
[1:46:04] promise that is before us but let us die
[1:46:06] more to ourselves in perfect strength of
[1:46:09] perfect weakness the Prophet says over
[1:46:11] and over three different junctions
[1:46:12] within that message concerning his own
[1:46:14] self and as he's leading into the next
[1:46:16] phase of his ministry he said I want God
[1:46:18] to remove me I'm too strong here the
[1:46:27] strength came forth a seed came forth
[1:46:31] Abraham his life here it is issuing out
[1:46:34] but it issues out Wildman
[1:46:39] it is truly we could say that's a seed
[1:46:44] of Abraham but Abraham could not have
[1:46:46] fellowship with that seed as far as in
[1:46:50] that of the inheritance and the airship
[1:46:53] that God intended but what what took
[1:46:57] place we find that no matter you know
[1:46:59] what would happen that the Bible tells
[1:47:03] us that Sarah afterwards not Syria but
[1:47:07] notice Sarah's discernment is honed in
[1:47:09] the scripture said Sarah saw in that
[1:47:13] tremendous it doesn't say Abraham saw
[1:47:15] it's a Sarah saw but Sarah had received
[1:47:20] of Abraham's faith come on somebody
[1:47:24] Abraham was ministering that revelation
[1:47:27] and the Prophet tells us it wasn't
[1:47:29] Sarah's faith it was Abraham's faith
[1:47:32] that brought that change and here the
[1:47:36] promise comes in the notice that
[1:47:38] learning formed in Sarah that in her
[1:47:41] life in her life it now brings
[1:47:44] discernment to where she sees that one
[1:47:48] who Ishmael mocking the son of the
[1:47:51] promise as her discernment is he's
[1:47:55] mocking her determinist is taking away
[1:47:58] you know that same discernment what was
[1:48:01] what you see with Abraham shooing away
[1:48:03] the fouls that same spirit of
[1:48:06] certainement was moving there and
[1:48:08] pulsating in Sara's life it wasn't
[1:48:11] necessarily fouls flying down but she
[1:48:13] caught it Ishmael is mocking the promise
[1:48:17] taking away from it so she gives word
[1:48:22] look at this Authority look at the voice
[1:48:23] that she has a voice of faith this is
[1:48:26] not the voice of reasoning now she
[1:48:28] speaks to Abraham and says cast out the
[1:48:30] bondwoman and her son because it shall
[1:48:33] not be heir with him with my son the son
[1:48:36] of the promise Isaac it shall not be and
[1:48:39] God stands back listen to me now God
[1:48:42] comes back around and he a man's what's
[1:48:45] been said he tells Abraham you hearken
[1:48:48] unto Sarah's vice he never told him to
[1:48:51] hearken the first time Abraham did that
[1:48:54] of his own self but this time this is
[1:48:56] not no one else but God letting Abraham
[1:49:00] know this is my mind
[1:49:03] she's a sign of wise she caught the
[1:49:08] mocking that was there within the camp
[1:49:14] what's the difference most were seeds
[1:49:18] both had come from that of of Abraham
[1:49:22] one before the deadness one after the
[1:49:26] change of the body both of them had that
[1:49:29] of seeds of life but the difference was
[1:49:32] is the bedding ground the bedding ground
[1:49:35] made the difference
[1:49:36] the bedding ground is what separated one
[1:49:39] to be a son of a bond woman and the
[1:49:41] other one to be the son of promise one
[1:49:44] of them God could have fellowship with
[1:49:46] and one of them God couldn't fellowship
[1:49:48] with and then put it to you like this
[1:49:51] this is where the Prophet tells us in
[1:49:53] power transformation
[1:49:54] he said that seed word that God sends
[1:49:56] forth that seed word he said you let it
[1:49:59] fall into a heart he said and then they
[1:50:01] start to pervert that word he said it in
[1:50:03] this word he said when it falls in like
[1:50:05] that he said he can make a good church
[1:50:07] member out of a doubter out of a skeptic
[1:50:10] out of an unbeliever he said but when
[1:50:11] you begin to tell him the word
[1:50:13] they'll never come in line with the word
[1:50:15] but don't let their hair grow they won't
[1:50:17] let let their lot be changed by the Word
[1:50:20] of God they never come to bear the image
[1:50:22] of Jesus Christ they cannot God can not
[1:50:25] have the kind of fellowship with them
[1:50:27] that he can with his children you
[1:50:31] understand what I'm talking about I love
[1:50:33] your children but there is a there is a
[1:50:35] different fellowship that I have with my
[1:50:37] children that I do with your children it
[1:50:40] ain't that I don't love them and then in
[1:50:41] then I don't love them at all but I have
[1:50:43] a different fellowship we said there are
[1:50:45] things that I'm able to intimately
[1:50:48] communicate with them there's things
[1:50:52] that they can ask me for is that right
[1:50:57] believe with the resources all of those
[1:51:00] things why there is a fellowship that is
[1:51:02] here because they are mine but
[1:51:08] instrumental hid no matter how much Holy
[1:51:10] Ghost comes on this rail he'll always be
[1:51:12] in his smell never able to come to the
[1:51:17] world but this smell takes the Holy
[1:51:20] Ghost and he uses the Holy Ghost as a
[1:51:23] benchmark to say what I've got speaking
[1:51:26] tongues and I do this and I do that and
[1:51:28] I do that and it does that without
[1:51:31] having a life that lives to the word oh
[1:51:34] my but thanks be to God there are sons
[1:51:38] of the promise
[1:51:40] there are daughters of the promise born
[1:51:43] of the Spirit of God in this hour that
[1:51:46] loves the Word of God that love his
[1:51:48] appearing amen
[1:51:51] children of God that are gain for this
[1:51:53] hour amen
[1:51:55] think of it how did God Himself to look
[1:51:59] in this hour you know to have fellowship
[1:52:02] fellowship also another on one meaning
[1:52:05] of the word fellowship is to be a
[1:52:06] partaker is that right to be a partaker
[1:52:10] the Bible tells us in Hebrews six there
[1:52:13] are those who have tasted of the good
[1:52:15] word of God but taken but never never a
[1:52:21] revelation never a change in her life
[1:52:24] never to wear that
[1:52:27] they they see this to be Jesus Christ
[1:52:30] revealed in this hour it's a truth
[1:52:34] friends but you see when that when that
[1:52:38] word has moved you don't got it you
[1:52:40] don't have to tell nobody it's a life
[1:52:43] that's lived this is where when the
[1:52:47] scripture declares of how the Lord Jesus
[1:52:49] here he is think of how the scripture
[1:52:52] says standing in the midst of his church
[1:52:55] declaring his name when God came in
[1:53:00] Redemption he didn't come as a woman I
[1:53:03] know that simple but God didn't come as
[1:53:05] a woman God came as a man right because
[1:53:12] it's a man that carries that of the life
[1:53:15] carries that of a father's name their
[1:53:19] rights
[1:53:19] he didn't come as a woman as a church
[1:53:21] but he came to redeem and bring his
[1:53:26] subjects to himself it had to be his
[1:53:28] life come forth to you and I without his
[1:53:32] life coming we are seeds that remain
[1:53:35] dead walking in this earth as dead men
[1:53:39] dead women a life to the world
[1:53:43] but dead to the things of God having no
[1:53:46] having no desire having no nothing with
[1:53:49] sin our life but that god himself had a
[1:53:52] desire and he's going to bring back he
[1:53:57] breeds back his own children you know
[1:54:01] sometimes you read about things and some
[1:54:02] of you no doubt follow things with on
[1:54:04] different pets and animals and things
[1:54:06] like that and they try to reestablish
[1:54:08] and get certain things back again they
[1:54:11] want maybe on a certain breed of dog or
[1:54:13] a certain cattle or what a more they're
[1:54:15] looking for certain characteristics
[1:54:16] they're looking back on something back
[1:54:18] there and they're trying to make
[1:54:20] selections of things out here
[1:54:21] to breed together so that they can
[1:54:23] somehow get this back here they're
[1:54:25] trying to take all kinds of parts to do
[1:54:27] that but God Himself in order to breed
[1:54:32] back it required him coming
[1:54:35] self his own life the bedding ground was
[1:54:41] here the bedding ground would be here in
[1:54:44] every age is that right for different
[1:54:47] types of ground that bedding ground
[1:54:48] would be here those seeds of God they
[1:54:51] would be here
[1:54:52] the bedding ground for the word to fall
[1:54:55] into and bring that into life it would
[1:54:58] be his life his water the water of the
[1:55:01] word passing over that sea and raising
[1:55:03] that seed up into life and then what
[1:55:05] does it do it brings forth a fellowship
[1:55:10] think of how the Prophet places it like
[1:55:13] this he says in the message invisible
[1:55:16] union of the Bride of Christ he said any
[1:55:18] son is the attributes of his father and
[1:55:21] just as you were in the genes of your
[1:55:24] father in the body of your father
[1:55:25] when he was a young boy you were in him
[1:55:28] yet you could not have fellowship yet he
[1:55:31] could not have fellowship with you
[1:55:32] because he didn't know you but through
[1:55:35] the betting grounds of a mother you were
[1:55:38] brought forth into the earth and
[1:55:39] becoming the image of your father then
[1:55:41] he could fellowship Levi walking around
[1:55:50] there in the loins of Abraham but
[1:55:52] Abraham couldn't have fellowship with
[1:55:54] him it was there but the only way
[1:55:59] fellowship could come is when it comes
[1:56:01] into expression so here as the seeds of
[1:56:07] God God remembered the desire for
[1:56:09] fellowship God sets it it makes an earth
[1:56:13] to take you and I honor and God places
[1:56:18] within our lives that seed it's already
[1:56:21] for known even listen the very design as
[1:56:24] David said in Psalms 139 my members yet
[1:56:27] being imperfect yet they were formed in
[1:56:28] thy book God knew that the stature the
[1:56:32] iconic God knew all of those things and
[1:56:36] God had everything set to even two
[1:56:40] generations on back that all of those
[1:56:42] things God orchestrating it all and here
[1:56:45] when you come up on this earth
[1:56:47] here God Himself deposits that seed when
[1:56:51] you drop from your mother's womb and the
[1:56:54] breath of life is taken there's that
[1:56:58] seed that real you that real me it's
[1:57:03] getting closer to time for expression
[1:57:06] it's not fully expressed but it's
[1:57:08] getting closer it's just like winner you
[1:57:12] know a young man young lady they're
[1:57:13] they're courting and then you know
[1:57:14] moving to engagement and then you know
[1:57:16] here into marriage and and it keeps
[1:57:18] they're moving closer to a time and then
[1:57:21] here when when there is a conception
[1:57:23] that takes place it's moving closer to a
[1:57:24] time of expression but the only way that
[1:57:27] it can be expressed is when that comes
[1:57:30] to birth and when that comes to birth
[1:57:33] which will always was there my brother
[1:57:37] Bram says as a 16 year old boy he says
[1:57:39] here I was he said Billy Paul was in me
[1:57:42] I didn't know it the difference is with
[1:57:46] God God knew it
[1:57:48] God knew just exactly what bed of time
[1:57:51] that you and I were going to come in
[1:57:54] we were fitted to that word and God's
[1:57:56] desire and longing just as a as a father
[1:58:00] and as a mother would be longing for
[1:58:02] their children to come into expression
[1:58:05] that they might fellowship with them and
[1:58:06] then think of this friends in the hour
[1:58:08] that we're living in you know there's a
[1:58:10] certain fellowship that you have when
[1:58:13] they come and they're newly born
[1:58:15] it's a fellowship of changing diapers
[1:58:19] it's a fellowship of burping getting up
[1:58:23] at night and all of those things
[1:58:24] it's a fellowship there's a bonding
[1:58:26] that's going on there's things that you
[1:58:28] cannot you know you're saying to them do
[1:58:31] you want this you want that they didn't
[1:58:32] understand that but they can hear your
[1:58:33] voice but it's like that to the mother
[1:58:35] they go to the mother and hearing the
[1:58:37] mother
[1:58:38] it's that heartbeat that's something
[1:58:40] that they knew in the womb and it's
[1:58:43] something that serves them and calms
[1:58:45] them and that's there it's a part of
[1:58:47] that time in their life there's a
[1:58:48] fellowship going on it's just not a
[1:58:50] fellowship of real great understanding
[1:58:55] but as time goes on the understanding
[1:58:58] increases the understanding increases
[1:59:01] there are responsibilities that's given
[1:59:04] at that time the Fellowship is
[1:59:06] increasing it's not no longer where you
[1:59:09] know things begin to change where it's
[1:59:10] no longer just do this and do that but
[1:59:13] there's a fellowship that's moving in
[1:59:15] where you're taking your sons or your
[1:59:16] son or your daughter and so forth you're
[1:59:18] saying yeah you're in being inclusive
[1:59:19] not demeaning but inclusive with them
[1:59:22] and really reaching out to to speak to
[1:59:25] them and to and to share within this in
[1:59:28] their life hi that's how God has been
[1:59:35] down through the ages there's been a
[1:59:38] nurturing and even within every one of
[1:59:41] our life there was a beginning and there
[1:59:43] is a beginning where there's a
[1:59:45] nourishing there's a need for the
[1:59:48] sincere milk of the word of God there is
[1:59:50] a beginning there's a nourishing all of
[1:59:52] those things are precious times of
[1:59:54] fellowship and I say it like this in
[1:59:56] this regards is that you know in times
[1:59:58] past I knew of individuals that would
[2:00:00] actually look at another brother or
[2:00:02] sister and they would deem them as not
[2:00:04] being spiritual because they couldn't
[2:00:06] remember certain quotes about the
[2:00:07] message or this or that and then they
[2:00:09] hand that about their life their friends
[2:00:11] that's that's not to credit the Spirit
[2:00:13] of God the spirit of God is to reach out
[2:00:16] it wants to create and bring forth that
[2:00:18] fellowship it's just like in your job if
[2:00:20] there's only people who can fellowship
[2:00:22] on salvation let's fellowship but
[2:00:27] there's a fellowship what does
[2:00:28] fellowship do you know yeah you don't
[2:00:30] increase things if you're not in the
[2:00:32] fellowship among us as believers
[2:00:34] brothers and sisters it's not altogether
[2:00:36] our words but it's our life we're a body
[2:00:38] of believers you know sometimes you have
[2:00:42] here you know you have the firstborn in
[2:00:43] the first part catching on different
[2:00:45] things and the other one maybe they're a
[2:00:47] little bit slower catching on you know
[2:00:49] why for the first point is doing
[2:00:50] everything for we know we can do
[2:00:54] everything for everybody but there is an
[2:00:58] image that is before that you also see
[2:01:00] when you have that of a firstborn going
[2:01:03] forth and those that come behind it
[2:01:05] there look and they begin to imitate
[2:01:07] those things
[2:01:08] they are seeing what is it it's
[2:01:10] influence from an image that said before
[2:01:13] and that's why it must be the image of
[2:01:16] Jesus Christ it's him
[2:01:18] walking in the midst of his church not
[2:01:20] not just standing he's walking in the
[2:01:23] midst of his church if he's walking that
[2:01:25] means he has a body to walk in they met
[2:01:30] he's moving through his church he
[2:01:32] declaring his name i am alpha i am omega
[2:01:36] what has he done he's breathing back
[2:01:38] sons and daughters again through the
[2:01:42] water of life the word going forth
[2:01:44] raising up the seeds of god that had
[2:01:47] been planted in that bed of time and
[2:01:49] what do they do express him in that hour
[2:01:55] the message itself what was print it's
[2:02:01] now flesh they say this to you there's
[2:02:07] not a printing press that can produce
[2:02:09] Christ in you there's not a man that can
[2:02:12] do that it's a sovereign work of God
[2:02:14] searching out us as his children and he
[2:02:19] moving by his Spirit brings forth the
[2:02:22] image of his own person inside of you
[2:02:25] and I there's a fellowship that's going
[2:02:28] on it's an intimate communion
[2:02:34] he's disclosing thoughts to you that to
[2:02:39] the rest of the world as the prophet
[2:02:41] called it flutters he cannot speak that
[2:02:44] way God's not interested in flirting
[2:02:47] he's interested in the depth of
[2:02:49] sincerity
[2:02:54] that's why this this this word this
[2:02:56] gospel it deserves every part of our
[2:02:59] life every part every part of us that
[2:03:05] fellowship what he has longed for what
[2:03:07] he's desired now it can become expressed
[2:03:10] within our lives the Prophet says so
[2:03:13] were you sons of God I'm closing sons
[2:03:16] and tons of God and daughters of God
[2:03:18] before there was even a moon stars or
[2:03:20] molecule you were sons and daughters of
[2:03:22] God for you are only the physical
[2:03:24] manifestation of the attributes that was
[2:03:26] in God at the beginning there's only one
[2:03:29] form of eternal life and that was you
[2:03:34] that's not God is eternal you're a part
[2:03:37] of God you always had eternal life the
[2:03:44] Holy Spirit comes to let you know the
[2:03:49] person of eternal life comes to let you
[2:03:52] know yes you don't know nothing about it
[2:03:58] neither did you know when you was in
[2:04:00] your earthly father anybody remember
[2:04:01] when they were in their earthly father
[2:04:03] don't raise your hand we don't want to
[2:04:06] embarrass you you don't a matter of fact
[2:04:09] sometimes we could look back and what's
[2:04:11] the earliest memory you have Booth's am
[2:04:13] i remember when I was 1 year old
[2:04:15] let me go on read now neither did you
[2:04:18] know when you was in your earthly father
[2:04:19] but you are manifested - in his image in
[2:04:23] the image of God you are made and you
[2:04:26] were manifested for the glory and the
[2:04:30] fellowship of God I want you to think
[2:04:34] about this here for a moment
[2:04:36] here is this little woman that we know
[2:04:39] so we you know we don't need we don't
[2:04:41] know her name all we know where's a
[2:04:44] woman at the will but here the Lord
[2:04:47] Jesus says I'm have must need to go by
[2:04:53] this way
[2:04:56] now I'm gonna tell you it's very clear
[2:04:58] when you look at the man who was
[2:05:01] remember on the road the Pharisees and
[2:05:05] different ones walked by him the
[2:05:06] religious of that day but the Samaritan
[2:05:08] came pick the guy up took him to the end
[2:05:11] remember that religion itself would have
[2:05:14] stayed so far away from that from that
[2:05:16] woman
[2:05:17] it did religion looked down on her
[2:05:19] because you know why religion couldn't
[2:05:21] help she didn't need religion she
[2:05:25] already had religion she knew about
[2:05:27] religion what she needed was the Living
[2:05:31] God she already had troubles and mess
[2:05:35] and all of the books that she'd got from
[2:05:37] the bookstore nothing delivered her you
[2:05:40] know how to how to have a successful
[2:05:42] marriage after 13 she didn't she didn't
[2:05:44] have that you understand that there was
[2:05:48] not power within the bookstore to give
[2:05:49] her that but what was what what was
[2:05:54] needed in her life was one visitation
[2:05:59] one moment one moment is all it took she
[2:06:06] come into the presence of the Living God
[2:06:09] and at that moment as the word began to
[2:06:13] talk to her none notice here she has
[2:06:15] eternal life the whole time as a seat of
[2:06:17] God that life is laying in there you
[2:06:19] understand what I'm talking about when
[2:06:21] brother Ram says this in multiple places
[2:06:22] the message the seat the life the germ
[2:06:24] of life is already there in the seed but
[2:06:27] it takes the quickening to release the
[2:06:29] germ that's there that's why the flow of
[2:06:33] the water the word is it passes over the
[2:06:35] sea it brings the seed for the rest of
[2:06:38] the dirt doesn't bother the rest of the
[2:06:40] dirt but it's intended for that seed so
[2:06:43] here she is standing there in that time
[2:06:45] and here the father is desiring he is
[2:06:49] seeking true worshipers why didn't he go
[2:06:53] up there to the temple they weren't true
[2:06:56] worshipers
[2:06:58] they were religious people but they
[2:07:01] weren't true worshipers but he was
[2:07:04] seeking such to worship him met with
[2:07:07] worship Him in spirit and in truth those
[2:07:11] who would be bought and could be born of
[2:07:14] the water in the spirit those who could
[2:07:17] receive the word for their day for their
[2:07:19] age for that hour could receive him one
[2:07:24] moment in his presence change the course
[2:07:28] of her life she never went back to the
[2:07:33] city and started self-help groups I hope
[2:07:36] y'all with me she never went back to the
[2:07:38] city and did that but she dropped her
[2:07:41] water puffs there was something greater
[2:07:43] than what daily and all the other things
[2:07:46] something had happened greater than all
[2:07:50] her plans something had taken place she
[2:07:54] received the answer she had been looking
[2:07:56] for she received the attention she had
[2:07:59] been craving well this was not loud that
[2:08:03] shot just to take advantage but this was
[2:08:06] allowed that sought to move and bring a
[2:08:09] change she went running into the city
[2:08:13] and began to say come see a man who told
[2:08:16] me all things no religion - it was a
[2:08:26] living witness of the Living God
[2:08:30] what had happened God said I have need
[2:08:32] to go by he was longing for fellowship
[2:08:35] and here he comes
[2:08:35] she comes into expression now there's
[2:08:38] fellowship see that seed he's dialoguing
[2:08:42] with that see it comes into expression
[2:08:45] and the prodigal son was away from home
[2:08:49] he went on his way he made his decision
[2:08:52] couldn't be couldn't have no fellowship
[2:08:54] that right couldn't have any fellowship
[2:08:57] but one day there was intercessory
[2:09:01] prayer that was being made the Prophet
[2:09:04] said there was a mother and father who
[2:09:05] were down in their living room and he
[2:09:06] said as they were praying the angel the
[2:09:08] Lord moved where that man was at he was
[2:09:16] at the lowest sometimes those things
[2:09:21] have to happen but the angel of the Lord
[2:09:26] came and whispered in his ear a prophet
[2:09:29] said it's time to come and he began to
[2:09:35] think in that right the scripture said
[2:09:37] he thought hey servants got it better
[2:09:40] than I have it here right there that
[2:09:47] moment in the midst of that Pigpen he
[2:09:51] made a decision and he made a decision
[2:09:54] to you the voice that was speaking to
[2:09:59] him that was calling him he didn't know
[2:10:06] how everything was going to be done but
[2:10:08] he yielded to that voice
[2:10:11] but God made away all that portrayal
[2:10:13] with the prodigal son
[2:10:14] God made away and here that young man
[2:10:18] comes back fellowship restored he was
[2:10:23] always a son but he couldn't be
[2:10:26] recognized as a son but now that he's
[2:10:30] come home his attitude is different
[2:10:33] everything is different his desire is
[2:10:36] I'll do whatever I'm not worthy to be
[2:10:42] called your son but the father said you
[2:10:50] can't change your name but beneath all
[2:10:58] of the month beneath all the gone there
[2:11:01] was that reality that was there all he
[2:11:05] needed was to get into the presence of
[2:11:08] his father changed everything they
[2:11:16] didn't have to bind him to the to the
[2:11:18] estate no no he's there to work to labor
[2:11:22] he's an expression of the father he's
[2:11:25] expressing the image of the father and
[2:11:29] this is why let's tan the Prophet says
[2:11:33] here we are sitting here as the children
[2:11:37] of God in this hour
[2:11:38] he said believing the Scriptures
[2:11:41] believing the message of the hour
[2:11:44] he says you're setting here present a
[2:11:46] vindication God moving and working in
[2:11:50] your life that life pulsating through
[2:11:54] you it's not something that we do not
[2:11:58] something that we have to make happen
[2:12:00] it's god it's sovereignly God moving and
[2:12:04] it's God overseeing it all for what
[2:12:07] fellowship
[2:12:09] a lot of things can try to come and
[2:12:12] stand in the way and get between that
[2:12:14] fellowship and hinder that but remember
[2:12:18] this is God's desire God does it he
[2:12:24] doesn't call us to be church members or
[2:12:27] that that that's miserable that's
[2:12:29] miserable that that gets old it's very
[2:12:33] miserable when things are just a duty it
[2:12:36] gets old I know some people can be very
[2:12:38] very very dedicated sometimes with
[2:12:40] things that even maybe you don't care
[2:12:41] about doing or like doing you can be
[2:12:43] dedicated but I'm talking about the love
[2:12:45] of God in our heart why why are we here
[2:12:49] why do we serve Him we serve Him because
[2:12:53] we love him why do we love him because
[2:12:55] he first
[2:12:59] it's the love of God in our hearts
[2:13:02] friends that's the real reality of the
[2:13:04] Holy Ghost moving in on that seed and
[2:13:07] quickening that seed it lets you know
[2:13:11] who you are there's a fellowship he
[2:13:14] communicates with you he tells you who
[2:13:19] you are
[2:13:20] he's strengthened you it's a fellowship
[2:13:24] all would he even long for now he's
[2:13:28] having that fellowship not with an
[2:13:30] infant but he's having it with his bride
[2:13:34] one who can understand things by his
[2:13:38] grace it's by his working you love him
[2:13:43] let's pray Heavenly Father more truly
[2:13:49] blessed fellowship your God that we have
[2:13:54] received Lord from you
[2:13:57] Lord we thank you what God held that
[2:14:01] your light moving across our pathways
