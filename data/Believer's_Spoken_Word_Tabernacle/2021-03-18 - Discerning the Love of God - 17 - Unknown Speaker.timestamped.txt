[37:15] for this time we give ourselves to you
[37:18] lord
[37:18] this congregation for your glory lord in
[37:21] jesus
[37:22] name amen
[37:25] god bless you tonight let's read in the
[37:27] bible first corinthians chapter 13.
[37:30] i want to go back to verse 1. come on
[37:33] down from there
[37:41] first corinthians chapter 13 verse 1
[37:45] though i speak with the tongues of men
[37:47] of angels
[37:49] have not charity and become as a
[37:52] sounding brass
[37:53] or a tingling symbol though i have the
[37:56] gift
[37:57] of prophecy and understand all mysteries
[38:00] and all knowledge though i have all
[38:03] faith
[38:04] so that i can remove mountains and have
[38:06] not
[38:07] charity i am nothing do i bestow all my
[38:11] goods to feed the poor
[38:13] though i give my body to be burned and
[38:16] have not
[38:17] charity it profited me nothing
[38:21] the charity suffereth law
[38:24] it's kind he envieth not
[38:27] it vaunteth not itself and is not
[38:32] up
[38:34] amen in the amplified bible just to pull
[38:37] that part out the last part is what i
[38:39] want to
[38:39] begin dealing with here this evening it
[38:42] is not puffed up means does not display
[38:45] itself
[38:47] hardly so it deals with with pride
[38:51] you look here in the definition of the
[38:53] word puffed
[38:54] there in the in the scripture it deals
[38:57] with the primary
[38:58] sense of blowing it just
[39:02] wind it depends on where that wind is
[39:04] coming from
[39:05] because the wind of the enemy it brings
[39:08] poison
[39:09] it brings pride but the wind of god
[39:11] brings life
[39:13] so it just depends you know it and god's
[39:16] wind doesn't
[39:16] bring emptiness it brings
[39:20] transformation it brings his nature
[39:23] it brings his character so this is why
[39:26] we could have everything else but
[39:28] without
[39:29] charity we're nothing so look at this
[39:32] with puffed up
[39:33] it means to inflate to blow up
[39:37] to cause to swell up to puff up
[39:40] make proud to be puffed up to bear
[39:43] oneself
[39:45] lawfully be proud may god bless you
[39:48] bless the reading of the word as you're
[39:49] being seated
[39:51] you know you think of this within our
[39:54] lives of how that the spirit of god
[39:56] would deal
[39:58] and express this through paul these are
[40:02] these are things that we understand that
[40:04] in our life that when we
[40:05] are born again of the spirit of god that
[40:08] just as much as you and i
[40:09] are humans we begin to take on the
[40:13] characteristics
[40:14] of a human we do not take upon the
[40:15] characteristics of a tree
[40:17] because the nature and the life what is
[40:19] within us is that of
[40:21] human and it will it will come out
[40:23] within its
[40:24] in the natural ways we're not there's
[40:26] not one of us here that's struggling to
[40:28] be a human
[40:29] it's the same way it is when we're born
[40:30] again of the spirit of god we're not
[40:32] we're not struggling to be a christian
[40:34] it is a life
[40:35] that then is automatically lived out of
[40:38] us
[40:39] we know that there is a maturity in our
[40:41] life of how the spirit of god would
[40:44] deal with our life and brood and move
[40:46] upon our lives to
[40:48] mature us and we recognize that maturity
[40:50] is not us getting to a place to where
[40:53] we are free from mistakes or even from
[40:55] for that matter
[40:56] of having maybe certain feelings or
[40:58] things that would arise but
[41:00] maturity is where we begin to recognize
[41:03] our
[41:03] need is for him completely is our
[41:07] self-sufficiency that'll never work
[41:09] we need him some real maturity is not
[41:12] something that we
[41:14] get to a place that we're higher it
[41:15] actually is quite the contrary
[41:17] it's actually a lowering of self that he
[41:20] might increase
[41:22] it's recognizing that we need him more
[41:24] and more
[41:25] and more and more and so when we look at
[41:29] these things
[41:30] we understand there's many things that
[41:32] as the attributes
[41:33] of the spirit of god would work within
[41:35] our life by the new birth and from that
[41:37] of the soul
[41:38] there is a change that has taken place
[41:41] where there is
[41:42] a new nature there's a new ownership
[41:44] there's a life that is there that moves
[41:46] to mold and shape our character and you
[41:48] and i know that character itself the
[41:50] holy ghost
[41:51] is the gift of god paul would call it
[41:53] the unspeakable
[41:55] gift of god but yet character is not a
[41:57] gift
[41:58] character is not something that can be
[42:00] given to any of us
[42:02] but character itself brother ram would
[42:04] simply put it this way
[42:05] it's a victory so in order for character
[42:08] if it's a victory then there must be
[42:10] battles or oppositions things that are
[42:13] set before us
[42:14] for us to overcome when we look in the
[42:16] land when israel would come in the land
[42:18] as soon as they cross the jordan
[42:20] then they come into the circumcision and
[42:23] once they move from there
[42:24] then now they're ready to start waging
[42:26] war on the inhabitants and start putting
[42:28] things
[42:29] out that have existed there they're
[42:31] there now ready to start tearing down
[42:33] idols tearing down orders
[42:35] tearing down pictures anything at all
[42:37] that would influence them in the wrong
[42:40] direction they've got an authority by
[42:42] god
[42:42] it's not them going into the land and
[42:45] trying to reform
[42:46] the land but they're going under the
[42:48] authority of thus saith the lord
[42:50] so have the word of god would direct him
[42:52] to take things down
[42:54] take take and take this away and
[42:56] submitting this that's the same way the
[42:57] holy spirit would do
[42:59] and work in our lives as well so the
[43:01] charity being that of
[43:03] god's own life the love of god the
[43:05] spirit of god
[43:06] it comes to influence our our our
[43:09] thoughts
[43:09] our actions and everything about our
[43:12] life and yet
[43:13] when we look at this some of these
[43:15] things as we've looked at it with
[43:17] envy with that part of it we've seen
[43:19] that with envy we've seen
[43:21] that even with vaunting or the boasting
[43:23] or the braggart and
[43:25] then here another characteristic that
[43:26] lets us know this
[43:28] is not what love is now you would look
[43:30] at this and you would think well
[43:31] that should just be a given but yet when
[43:34] we
[43:34] recognize it it's god letting us know
[43:37] that that nature that's down there on
[43:38] the inside
[43:39] that real nature on the inside will
[43:41] never exhibit these types of things
[43:43] but you and i are still left within
[43:47] this pest house we're still left within
[43:50] this
[43:50] two parts of us that are unredeemed the
[43:53] soul has been
[43:54] redeemed and we're looking to the
[43:56] redemption of the body
[43:57] human spirit that'll be replaced with
[43:59] the theophany because there is the
[44:01] perfection
[44:02] of three soul theophany glorified body
[44:05] so in the meantime here the spirit of
[44:07] god comes into our life by the new
[44:09] nature
[44:10] and god would admonish us to mortify the
[44:13] deeds
[44:14] of the body through the spirit these are
[44:16] not things that that god himself will do
[44:19] for us but it's things that you and i
[44:21] are entrusted with
[44:23] to recognize when things would want to
[44:25] rise up maybe it's a certain
[44:27] feeling or a certain way and the spirit
[44:29] of god as we will recognize it remember
[44:32] brother ram tells us there's two there's
[44:34] two parts to overcoming
[44:35] recognize the devil at every one of his
[44:38] tricks and then
[44:39] recognize that the god in you is greater
[44:42] and has
[44:43] already overcome that thing so it's to
[44:46] submit to the god who is within us
[44:48] mortify the deeds of the body bringing
[44:51] the body in subjection to the life
[44:53] that's within it
[44:54] because every one of these things that
[44:55] we've looked at here from that of
[44:57] envy to that of boasting and now when we
[45:00] look at this of pride they all
[45:01] you'll see how they all go together but
[45:03] yet let me just say this to you
[45:05] they are all spirits because even
[45:08] thoughts that come to you
[45:09] thoughts that may be of a wrong feeling
[45:12] thoughts that would come of a
[45:14] you know of something that maybe
[45:16] somebody said something in a way and you
[45:18] think
[45:18] why did they say it that way and that
[45:20] thought comes remember that thought is
[45:22] not just something of
[45:23] error but that thought is a spirit and
[45:26] the spirit remember it's always
[45:28] looking for some sort of an avenue or
[45:31] some way that it can somehow get in you
[45:34] know it's like a little balloon
[45:35] you take a balloon that's laying out
[45:37] you're getting ready to blow it up for
[45:38] the parties
[45:39] you know birthday party it's a little
[45:41] thing you know it's just laying down out
[45:42] of the way
[45:43] but as soon as you get that balloon and
[45:45] you get it filled with somebody that's
[45:47] got a lot of
[45:48] air they can blow that balloon up
[45:49] depending on what kind of balloon it is
[45:51] some of them are harder to blow up than
[45:52] others
[45:53] but you know you got to stretch it out
[45:54] and stretch it out but you begin to
[45:56] inflate that balloon and that balloon
[45:58] itself it grows bigger
[46:00] now it looks a lot bigger than what it
[46:02] actually is
[46:03] but but in reality all that it is is a
[46:06] lot of
[46:07] air and these are the things that when
[46:09] we see this with
[46:11] with the leading of the lord paul would
[46:13] write to you and i am this way this
[46:14] scripture will
[46:15] will pertain a lot to us as some of the
[46:17] things we begin to look at here
[46:19] this evening in second corinthians
[46:21] chapter 10 paul said for though we walk
[46:23] in the flesh
[46:25] we do not war after the flesh for the
[46:27] weapons of our warfare
[46:29] are not carnal but mighty through
[46:32] god to the pulling down of strongholds
[46:36] you know what strongholds are they are
[46:38] retreats castles or let me just put it
[46:41] simply
[46:41] excuses strongholds casting down
[46:44] notice what it says casting down
[46:47] imaginations that's familiar language
[46:49] the devil knows what it means to be cast
[46:51] down
[46:52] so casting down imaginations these are
[46:55] things that would want to exalt
[46:57] themselves notice casting down
[46:59] imaginations and every high
[47:02] thing that exalteth itself
[47:06] against the knowledge of god there's
[47:08] only one that i know
[47:09] who exalts self and that's the devil
[47:12] because it's where it operates totally
[47:14] contrary
[47:14] to the very kingdom and program of god
[47:17] god he descends cle
[47:18] dad god moves down to the very lowest
[47:21] and then it rises to the very highest
[47:24] so we see that this thing as the
[47:26] scripture says
[47:27] cast down every high thing a high
[47:30] thought that would
[47:31] exalt itself above the knowledge of god
[47:34] now there's things within the word that
[47:36] you and i know that there's things that
[47:38] we don't have to pray about and say
[47:40] well lord is it wrong for me to feel
[47:42] this way against my brother and my
[47:44] sister
[47:44] you don't got to pray about that you
[47:46] know what the word says there's many
[47:48] things
[47:48] that are laid out within the word then
[47:50] there are other things that can come our
[47:52] way
[47:52] that we do got to pray about now the
[47:55] praying about doing that part as i
[47:56] mentioned before
[47:57] you might have to pray as brother brahm
[47:59] said until you feel better towards that
[48:02] person
[48:02] before you talk to them again so notice
[48:06] casting down imaginations and every high
[48:08] thing that exalteth itself
[48:09] against the knowledge of god and
[48:11] bringing into captivity
[48:13] every thought to the obedience of christ
[48:15] and having it in a readiness to revenge
[48:17] all disobedience
[48:18] when your obedience is fulfilled we
[48:20] realize these scriptures
[48:21] these are not things that god will do
[48:23] for us but these are things that we must
[48:26] yield ourselves to god
[48:27] and then god himself empowers equips us
[48:31] he gives to you and i have the strength
[48:32] as we yield to him
[48:35] then this is what he himself comes on
[48:37] the scene to do
[48:39] now when you look at this here i want to
[48:41] go to the book of ezekiel and you begin
[48:43] to see
[48:44] of how that things that when we look at
[48:46] this puffed up or when something that
[48:49] self
[48:49] can begin and you know would begin soul
[48:52] seemingly small but then it would
[48:55] exhibit itself you would look
[48:56] where does this start from this puffed
[48:58] up because this inflated this is
[49:01] something that would happen
[49:03] within a person or an individual before
[49:05] it ever manifests
[49:07] itself out in a physical realm it
[49:10] happens
[49:11] within now notice when we look at this
[49:13] characteristic
[49:14] we're going to track this down by the
[49:16] help of the lord and looking at this
[49:18] this very characteristic of how that
[49:21] this
[49:21] pride and how it begins to move as we
[49:24] see it here
[49:25] in the book of ezekiel chapter 28 verse
[49:27] 12
[49:28] son of man take up a lamentation upon
[49:30] the king of tyrus now this is a
[49:32] nation this is a national king and say
[49:36] unto him
[49:37] thus saith the lord god thou sealest up
[49:40] the sun
[49:41] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[49:44] thou hast been
[49:45] in eden the garden of god this king had
[49:48] never been in the garden of god
[49:49] but the discernment of the spirit of god
[49:52] recognized
[49:52] who was behind this nation who was
[49:55] behind this king president whatever you
[49:57] want to say it dictator
[49:58] he recognized the spirit that was behind
[50:01] him you see
[50:02] god when god deals with the situation
[50:04] he's not dealing with this out here he's
[50:06] speaking to the spirit
[50:07] he's speaking to that that's why brother
[50:09] bram said in the prayer lines
[50:10] he said when things would begin to take
[50:12] place in these meetings
[50:14] it's a revelation of the holy ghost that
[50:16] uncovers the devil
[50:17] and he said you can begin to see the
[50:19] change of countenance
[50:21] on people's face because the devil
[50:24] is being exposed where he has got a hold
[50:27] in their life through indifference or
[50:29] sin and on and on and on so
[50:31] we recognize the spirit of god it's not
[50:34] dealing out here
[50:35] so much in this realm even though maybe
[50:37] a person there can be certain things
[50:39] that are being expressed out here in
[50:40] this realm
[50:41] but you can do all you want to out here
[50:44] in this realm but you'll never get to
[50:45] what the real
[50:46] real real root of the problem is you got
[50:49] to deal with that spirit you got to deal
[50:50] with that nature
[50:51] you got to deal with what it is that's
[50:53] influencing it
[50:55] so notice thou hast been in the eden the
[50:57] garden of god every
[50:59] precious stone was thy covering the
[51:01] sardis topaz the diamond burl
[51:03] the onyx the jasper the sapphire emerald
[51:06] carbuncle gold
[51:07] workmanship of thy temperance and of thy
[51:10] pipes
[51:10] was prepared in the in the day that thou
[51:12] was created
[51:14] thou art the anointed cherubim that
[51:16] covereth
[51:17] think of how close and have sent thee so
[51:20] who set him to be this way god did
[51:24] thou waste upon the holy mountain of god
[51:27] you couldn't get no closer
[51:30] he could you couldn't get no closer no
[51:32] anointed cherubim that covered
[51:35] and thou hast walked up and down in the
[51:37] midst of the stones of fire
[51:39] thou was perfect look at this look at
[51:41] this thou was perfect
[51:43] in thy ways from the day that thou
[51:46] was created till iniquity
[51:50] was found in thee who's he talking about
[51:53] lucifer satan he's identifying the
[51:57] spirit that's behind this king
[51:58] by the multitude of thy merchandise they
[52:01] have filled the midst of thee with
[52:02] violence and thou has sinned therefore i
[52:04] will cast thee as profane
[52:06] out of the mountain of god and i will
[52:08] destroy the old covering cherub
[52:10] from the midst of the stones of fire
[52:12] thine heart now watch this
[52:13] thine heart was lifted up because
[52:17] of thy beauty who gave him his beauty
[52:20] god did who created him god did
[52:24] god gave him the beauty that he had
[52:27] but yet notice thine heart was lifted up
[52:30] because of thy beauty so there was
[52:33] a place as it shows us in the scripture
[52:36] that
[52:36] actually what what here is something
[52:39] that is
[52:39] god-given but he pulled it out from
[52:43] under being under the word of god or
[52:45] under
[52:46] the oversight or the influence of god
[52:48] and the very thing that was
[52:50] given to him beauty that was that was a
[52:53] great thing but when it pulled out
[52:54] he pulled it out from under the
[52:56] influence of the word and begin to move
[52:58] it for his own self
[53:00] this is the very thing that led to his
[53:02] downfall
[53:03] now notice thine heart was lifted up
[53:06] because of thy beauty so it began in the
[53:07] heart
[53:08] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[53:11] of thy brightness
[53:13] satan is look at this this wisdom it
[53:15] speaks he was a great man
[53:17] as far as an archangel remember he was
[53:19] the most beautiful
[53:20] archangel he was one of great
[53:24] beauty now notice i will cast thee to
[53:27] the ground i will lay thee before kings
[53:29] that they may behold thee now let me
[53:31] just let me move on here
[53:33] you see when we look at this we find
[53:36] that how
[53:37] down through the scriptures we find
[53:38] clairol from the book of revelations
[53:40] we find that even when this this very
[53:44] same thing this rebellion that was that
[53:47] was
[53:47] led there in heaven we don't know how
[53:50] long because we know this was in
[53:52] this was in heaven this was in eternity
[53:55] how long was this
[53:56] was this something that was moving
[53:58] within his heart when was it something
[54:00] that
[54:01] all of a sudden that it just began to
[54:02] move in a way that
[54:04] he began to envy he wanted a kingdom
[54:07] that was more beautiful than michael's
[54:10] he wanted to take away and
[54:12] he wanted to draw people or angels after
[54:15] himself
[54:16] and to think of this this same attribute
[54:18] of this
[54:19] of beauty where things are more
[54:21] beautiful he
[54:22] he when he came down to earth after he
[54:25] was kicked out of heaven
[54:26] remember this he came down and he comes
[54:29] with that same measure
[54:30] when when cain comes to offer before god
[54:34] think of that abel comes with a bloody
[54:36] lamb and
[54:37] cain comes with the fruits of the field
[54:40] they weren't rotten
[54:41] god never turned down the sacrifice
[54:43] because they were rotten and you know
[54:45] had had all kinds of spots on them they
[54:47] were the most
[54:48] beautiful fruits and everything about it
[54:52] was
[54:52] beautiful but yet when it came to it god
[54:55] rejected cain's sacrifice
[54:57] cain put a lot of effort into it but
[55:00] everything that cain thought that it
[55:01] would be
[55:02] beauty that would actually draw the
[55:05] attention of god
[55:06] but he failed to recognize god this not
[55:08] god is not moved
[55:10] by our beauty god looks on the heart
[55:13] it's not the outward beauty that god is
[55:16] looking at
[55:17] god's been looking at the inner beauty
[55:19] of what real
[55:20] genuine character is this is why paul
[55:23] would open and say
[55:24] though i have all these gifts i could do
[55:26] this i can have i can do that
[55:28] all of these things that can be done but
[55:30] yet if i have not the beauty
[55:32] of the love of god the character of god
[55:34] then i'm
[55:35] nothing you see satan himself he
[55:38] operates in this way
[55:39] it has been the same way that he's
[55:41] always presented it before people
[55:43] he presents things in a way that it's
[55:45] beauty that it's harmless that it's okay
[55:48] it's fine but yet beneath that all of
[55:50] that hot air
[55:51] is a lot of death there's no substance
[55:54] there's no life listen to me
[55:56] satan himself is a very religious man
[55:59] this guy was the right hand man to god
[56:02] he knows how to worship
[56:03] he knows the order of these things he
[56:05] knows he knows all about this
[56:08] so he knows how to move people within
[56:10] these things
[56:11] and satan himself in order to actually
[56:14] gain a following he must make things
[56:18] appealing it must be beautiful so the
[56:21] same way that he moved in heaven
[56:23] is the same way when those angelic
[56:26] battles
[56:26] fell upon human beings he moves it in
[56:29] the same way
[56:30] he draws it out within beauty look at it
[56:33] to where even when john let's make a
[56:35] quantum leap
[56:36] clear to the very end in the book of
[56:38] revelations when john
[56:40] is given a private guided tour of the
[56:42] book of revelation
[56:44] by that of an angel one who was sent and
[56:46] remember he was a prophet
[56:48] he was there to uncover what was symbols
[56:51] and begin to unfold these things
[56:53] when john saw this church this
[56:56] harlot
[56:56] church john when he looked upon her my
[56:59] house she was
[57:00] decked and man how she was just so
[57:03] beautiful and it was
[57:04] remember he said i i was in awe i
[57:07] wondered he was just taken in awe but
[57:10] all of a sudden the spirit
[57:12] of god it begins to uncover all of her
[57:15] crosses
[57:16] all of her everything else her gold her
[57:18] scarlet
[57:19] it begins to uncover every bit of it and
[57:22] show
[57:22] that she is filled with the blood
[57:26] of the martyrs she herself that looks so
[57:29] beautiful that looks as though
[57:31] she saw it so struck john but once
[57:34] it was revealed to john where john was
[57:37] awestruck at one time
[57:38] he said i ain't going after that woman
[57:40] no more i'm courting her no more
[57:42] i sure am getting engaged to her i this
[57:45] has been
[57:46] uncovered you see what the spirit of god
[57:48] how precious
[57:49] the leading of the holy ghost is when
[57:52] we're praying and we're looking to god
[57:54] god will seek to it if our heart desires
[57:57] to walk in truth
[57:58] and desires to walk in the word the holy
[58:01] ghost is still
[58:02] a revealer and a discerner and he'll
[58:04] uncover things
[58:06] if we'll only look to him
[58:09] beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful
[58:14] and it works the same pattern it works
[58:17] to get into nations you realize when
[58:20] when satan took jesus and he shows him
[58:23] there
[58:24] in the temptations remember what he told
[58:26] him he said fall down and worship me
[58:28] and i'll give you all these kingdoms but
[58:31] let me just tell you something
[58:32] at one time they weren't his kingdoms
[58:36] you realize when every nation and
[58:38] everything started it did not always
[58:40] start out that they belong to satan
[58:42] but the bible would record how that
[58:44] lucifer himself
[58:45] weakens the nations he moves
[58:48] in what starts out like look at our own
[58:51] nation
[58:51] started out with real godly principles
[58:55] our constitution godly men think of this
[58:57] now
[58:58] men who sit there in the congress every
[59:01] year
[59:01] beginning on january 1st they would get
[59:04] a brand new bible
[59:05] and they would take and they would write
[59:07] in their bibles they would read their
[59:09] bible
[59:09] and after december 31st they would take
[59:12] that bible
[59:13] and give it to one of their family
[59:14] members that had their notes wrote in it
[59:17] but january 1st they would get another
[59:19] bible they would do the same thing
[59:20] look at this public school you know the
[59:22] reason public school came in
[59:24] these are things that you can go and
[59:26] read the reason public school came in
[59:28] is so that people children would learn
[59:31] to read
[59:32] the bible because the founding fathers
[59:35] believed
[59:36] they believed it like this they said if
[59:38] people will
[59:39] read the bible and it will be revered we
[59:42] will not need
[59:43] police officers oh my
[59:46] they weren't defunding they just were
[59:48] upholding the law
[59:49] but now i'm one that says don't you dare
[59:51] defund them
[59:53] we need them with all the lawlessness
[59:55] and everything else that's going on
[59:57] insanity among people but you see look
[1:00:00] where
[1:00:00] it's got to look how it comes in satan
[1:00:03] did not come in by a storm
[1:00:05] he comes in by deception or as the
[1:00:08] scripture says
[1:00:09] flatteries he comes in and flatteries
[1:00:13] and beauty he weakens the same way he
[1:00:15] comes to the nations
[1:00:16] is the same way that he did in heaven
[1:00:19] with those angels
[1:00:20] that third part of the stars that he led
[1:00:22] it's the same way that he came to eat
[1:00:25] he began to flatter her he began to
[1:00:27] touch her hand and he began to let her
[1:00:29] know
[1:00:29] this is a purpose you were made for let
[1:00:31] me just tell you something
[1:00:32] as a young person and anybody else don't
[1:00:35] you dare
[1:00:36] allow the enemy to interpret to you why
[1:00:38] you were made or your purpose
[1:00:40] or who you are let god's word let it be
[1:00:43] the defining factor
[1:00:45] of your life god god birthed you you
[1:00:47] were born a boy you are a boy
[1:00:49] you were born a girl you are a girl
[1:00:52] you'll stay a male you'll stay a female
[1:00:54] and served the very purpose and the
[1:00:57] economy of almighty god
[1:00:58] and god himself will teach you the
[1:01:01] purposes
[1:01:02] he'll guide you in every facet of your
[1:01:04] life if you'll look to him all those
[1:01:06] times
[1:01:07] where he has to correct us because
[1:01:09] everything is not about flatteries
[1:01:11] give you what you want let you do what
[1:01:13] you want but god is a faithful parent
[1:01:16] he's there to correct us he's there to
[1:01:18] point out if you go this way
[1:01:20] this is what's going to happen if you
[1:01:22] keep going this way why
[1:01:23] he's not interested in taking your life
[1:01:26] by flatteries
[1:01:27] that's to blow you up in the wrong way
[1:01:30] but god's interested in our character
[1:01:33] that it would be molded and shaped by
[1:01:36] his own
[1:01:37] glorious character it's a character and
[1:01:40] a life
[1:01:40] that'll stand the test of time
[1:01:44] glory be to god this was a kingdom that
[1:01:48] was based on appeal you know the bible
[1:01:51] that says
[1:01:52] the soul that sinneth that's who shall
[1:01:54] die
[1:01:56] the bible says sin is pleasurable for a
[1:01:59] season
[1:02:00] it's based upon beauty or that which is
[1:02:03] made
[1:02:04] easy the same way that he came to eve
[1:02:07] same way from heaven
[1:02:08] same way he moves into the nations it's
[1:02:10] the same way that he'll move
[1:02:11] upon a preacher and then we'll move from
[1:02:13] that preacher he'll move right into the
[1:02:15] congregation
[1:02:16] he'll move upon that daddy move right
[1:02:17] down into the home you see satan
[1:02:20] always comes in a way to want to weaken
[1:02:22] brother and sister
[1:02:23] if there's one thing that you and i
[1:02:25] should be able to stand there
[1:02:27] if there's anything that tries to weaken
[1:02:30] the prescription of god's holy word
[1:02:32] we can look at that and just as those
[1:02:34] true ephesians they could look at them
[1:02:37] in that day
[1:02:38] and said you are a false apostle you're
[1:02:41] not
[1:02:41] saying what paul said well you know but
[1:02:43] paul meant it like this you're a liar
[1:02:45] paul said it like this and i'm just
[1:02:48] gonna happen to
[1:02:50] say it and if you want to say it's his
[1:02:52] opinion i'll take his opinion
[1:02:54] over your opinion any day
[1:02:57] i'll stay with this word
[1:03:01] are you with me i look at those things
[1:03:04] so now
[1:03:04] we recognize of what that you and i are
[1:03:07] dialed into of how
[1:03:09] that the enemy would want to come in
[1:03:11] that manner you see
[1:03:12] he we we need to follow when that when
[1:03:14] these things are coming
[1:03:16] and we see it coming about this is the
[1:03:18] very things as we're saying
[1:03:19] it's time to cast it down when the enemy
[1:03:22] presents you with the thought
[1:03:23] cast it down don't you don't have to
[1:03:25] reason it out
[1:03:26] you don't have to prove nothing to that
[1:03:28] devil cast it out
[1:03:30] if listen when the word when something
[1:03:33] has
[1:03:34] rose in your mind i hope you're with me
[1:03:36] now
[1:03:37] those of you sometimes and every one of
[1:03:39] us we fight mind battles from time to
[1:03:41] time and there's things that
[1:03:42] that can come up but just remember this
[1:03:44] right here that when those things arise
[1:03:46] you remember
[1:03:48] as the enemy and as a spirit wanting to
[1:03:50] get you all worked up what must i do
[1:03:52] cast him out the bible says
[1:03:56] submit yourselves unto god that means
[1:03:59] come under
[1:04:00] the lord if there's anything that's out
[1:04:02] of line lord forgive me
[1:04:03] getting back in line then resist the
[1:04:06] devil
[1:04:06] and he will flee from you
[1:04:11] you know he's used to being cast out so
[1:04:13] we might as well keep it going
[1:04:14] he's used to being thrown out he was not
[1:04:17] given an
[1:04:18] escalator matter of fact you'll never
[1:04:20] read where satan descended
[1:04:22] the bible says he fell from heaven in
[1:04:24] revelations chapter 9
[1:04:26] it says we saw him fall from heaven but
[1:04:29] when you read revelations 10
[1:04:31] 1 i saw a mighty angel descending
[1:04:34] down from heaven oh glory you know what
[1:04:36] it speaks that there is
[1:04:38] power and authority in humility through
[1:04:41] a life
[1:04:42] that will descend and submit itself to
[1:04:45] the word
[1:04:45] there's power to power to live a real
[1:04:48] life of authority
[1:04:50] that same beauty the same attribute
[1:04:52] think about it the very thing that god
[1:04:54] gave him lucifer could not say
[1:04:58] this thing that happened oh it's it's
[1:05:01] hurt me
[1:05:02] no he failed he failed
[1:05:06] right by allowing
[1:05:09] a thought to enter
[1:05:12] right and it started to blow now maybe
[1:05:14] that it started out new and
[1:05:18] it just blew up a little bit know it
[1:05:22] just started coming in the church and
[1:05:23] looking around thinking
[1:05:26] wow these real sorry people
[1:05:31] just keeps on going they look like
[1:05:33] they've got a lot of problems they've
[1:05:35] always got
[1:05:36] prayer requests they're always
[1:05:38] requesting the same thing
[1:05:40] maybe they don't have faith like i have
[1:05:45] and it just keeps
[1:05:51] who's doing that not god
[1:05:56] satan it's poison
[1:05:59] breath of satan
[1:06:03] you see this is why that the beauty or
[1:06:05] anything that god has given
[1:06:07] your eye things that we can even look at
[1:06:10] with beauty i'm not going to preach on
[1:06:11] that part of it tonight
[1:06:12] but to look at the things that god has
[1:06:15] given to you and i
[1:06:16] even things that can be within the
[1:06:18] natural it's things that you and i are
[1:06:20] to guard
[1:06:21] or to watch over even when it comes to
[1:06:24] you know a life that can have
[1:06:26] great spiritual understanding but it's
[1:06:28] to watch over that
[1:06:30] and don't allow things as we would say
[1:06:32] to go to your head
[1:06:34] because you see one of the very simplest
[1:06:36] things that you can
[1:06:37] look at you can think well this is
[1:06:39] something that's of god let me just give
[1:06:41] you
[1:06:41] just a little quote to kind of tease you
[1:06:44] with that thought a little bit
[1:06:45] on beauty brother brown tells us and how
[1:06:47] can i overcome
[1:06:48] he said just as satan propositioned
[1:06:50] jesus when he was on the mountain
[1:06:52] he said you started out sisters he said
[1:06:55] after god got a hold of your life
[1:06:56] you let your hair grow long he said then
[1:06:59] all of a sudden
[1:07:00] he said a little thought or a feeling
[1:07:02] came your way
[1:07:03] my i didn't know i looked so good with
[1:07:05] long hair he said
[1:07:06] right there satan is setting in to
[1:07:09] proposition you
[1:07:11] he said you must overcome that
[1:07:14] now isn't long hair that's that's god's
[1:07:16] word is that not
[1:07:18] that's the word of god in obedience to
[1:07:19] the word of god but it just goes to show
[1:07:22] that even in our obedience to the word
[1:07:25] of god
[1:07:25] it's that where we don't want to allow
[1:07:27] it to become a place
[1:07:28] that satan can blow and inflate air
[1:07:33] hallelujah now to think of this when we
[1:07:36] look here in the scriptures let's
[1:07:38] look at this here just for a moment when
[1:07:40] we look here at beauty and
[1:07:41] let me just kind of skip down here to
[1:07:43] ezekiel 16 verse 13. you can
[1:07:45] read the rest of the chapter when you
[1:07:46] get home but god is reminding israel
[1:07:49] here they are in captivity
[1:07:51] down in babylon he's reminding them
[1:07:54] of where he brought them from he's
[1:07:57] reminding them
[1:07:58] that even when you were born nobody
[1:08:01] cared for you
[1:08:02] nobody took you up you matter of fact
[1:08:05] you were sitting there
[1:08:07] in in your own blood but i passed by
[1:08:10] your way
[1:08:10] and i said live i said live i took you
[1:08:14] i washed you and god begins to move how
[1:08:17] did he
[1:08:17] begin to move with israel god provided
[1:08:20] for them
[1:08:21] their garments their attire god begins
[1:08:24] to let them know
[1:08:25] i was the god i'm the god who was right
[1:08:27] there with you the whole time
[1:08:28] in other words i'm the one who took you
[1:08:32] when you were nothing and i have
[1:08:34] provided for you
[1:08:36] as a faithful husband i have given to
[1:08:38] you
[1:08:39] all that you have need of and here he
[1:08:41] picks it up in verse 13
[1:08:43] thou was depth with gold and silver thy
[1:08:46] raiment was a fine linen and silk
[1:08:48] embroidered work thou didst eat the
[1:08:51] flower
[1:08:52] and honey and oil and thou wast
[1:08:54] exceeding beautiful
[1:08:56] thou didst prosper into a kingdom they
[1:08:58] grew
[1:08:59] there into a kingdom and thy renown went
[1:09:02] forth among the heathen
[1:09:04] for thy beauty for it was perfect
[1:09:07] through my comments
[1:09:12] you remove the commonness of the lord
[1:09:15] and the beauty is no longer renowned
[1:09:19] simply put brother banham said it like
[1:09:21] this in the church age book
[1:09:23] he said you take the spirit of god from
[1:09:26] the church
[1:09:27] and you've got nothing but a bejeweled
[1:09:29] corpse
[1:09:30] it's dead
[1:09:35] hallelujah so this is what what gives
[1:09:38] the church
[1:09:39] its beauty it's his comerness it's his
[1:09:42] life
[1:09:43] it's his glory it's not our works it's
[1:09:46] our
[1:09:46] yielding and his life it's him that
[1:09:49] takes
[1:09:50] us who was shameful who was ugly and he
[1:09:53] himself
[1:09:54] comes and he brings forth out of a
[1:09:56] situation of despair
[1:09:58] a situation that nobody would help us
[1:10:01] nor could
[1:10:02] they help us but he comes along and he
[1:10:04] takes a situation
[1:10:06] that everybody would have passed by on
[1:10:08] they would not have given a given
[1:10:10] anything
[1:10:11] for this spot of land but god said i
[1:10:14] know
[1:10:14] there's a seed on the inside there's a
[1:10:17] son or daughter there
[1:10:18] on the inside and his life been being
[1:10:21] imparted
[1:10:22] what does it do it brings forth the
[1:10:24] beauty of his holiness
[1:10:31] perfect through my comeliness which i
[1:10:34] had put upon thee you didn't merit it
[1:10:39] i put it upon it you yielded to me as my
[1:10:43] wife and i put my comeliness upon you
[1:10:48] but thou didst trust
[1:10:52] in thine own beauty
[1:10:55] get this beauty where did this beauty
[1:10:57] come from it come from god
[1:11:00] see they got to looking more at the
[1:11:03] gifts instead of the giver or
[1:11:05] they begin to look at things that were
[1:11:07] taking place instead of
[1:11:08] who it was that was doing it
[1:11:13] they began to look at it in a manner as
[1:11:16] though
[1:11:16] it was something that they had done and
[1:11:18] as soon as that took place
[1:11:20] in their heart it began to remove from
[1:11:24] god
[1:11:28] this is why the bible would say trust in
[1:11:30] the lord with all
[1:11:32] thine heart
[1:11:36] isaiah 14 i referred to this moments ago
[1:11:38] but i want you to look at this here
[1:11:42] once again here is isaiah by the spirit
[1:11:44] of god
[1:11:45] he's speaking to the spirit that's in
[1:11:48] the king
[1:11:49] of babylon and he's identifying
[1:11:53] the spirit how art thou fallen
[1:11:57] from heaven o lucifer
[1:12:01] son of a morning how art thou cut down
[1:12:03] to the ground
[1:12:04] which didst weaken the nations
[1:12:09] for thou has said in thine heart
[1:12:12] i will ascend into heaven i will exalt
[1:12:15] my throne above the stars of god
[1:12:18] i will sit also upon the mountain of the
[1:12:20] congregation you know one there's one
[1:12:22] big problem here
[1:12:23] i huge problem i i
[1:12:26] i i i in the sides of the north i will
[1:12:29] ascend
[1:12:30] above the heights of the clouds i will
[1:12:32] be like
[1:12:34] the most high so as we
[1:12:37] looked at that the weakening it
[1:12:40] weakening it just starts
[1:12:41] to weaken to where he gains
[1:12:45] control beauty and little
[1:12:49] by little you see when we look at this
[1:12:55] brother adam would speak of it in this
[1:12:57] man i just want to refer
[1:12:58] this and he's tying this in with with
[1:13:01] this
[1:13:01] this this fall of satan
[1:13:05] he says he was the greatest person in
[1:13:07] the heavens outside of god
[1:13:09] he was god's right-hand man to
[1:13:11] fellowship and he got puffed up in his
[1:13:13] heart
[1:13:13] i want to just drop this in and leave
[1:13:15] this right here
[1:13:17] as we said moments ago you couldn't have
[1:13:19] gotten no closer to god than what he was
[1:13:22] right but yet he was so close to god
[1:13:26] but his heart went away and once his
[1:13:29] heart
[1:13:29] went away how did his heart go away it
[1:13:32] went into its
[1:13:32] own way and as soon as that happened
[1:13:37] then there was nothing left than for him
[1:13:39] to be
[1:13:40] cast out of heaven you see brother i'm
[1:13:43] saying ending like just about the same
[1:13:45] thing today he said god
[1:13:46] can bless a fellow put him put a little
[1:13:48] confidence in him and he gets to be a
[1:13:50] know-it-all
[1:13:51] he's got to start an organization or
[1:13:53] he's got to do something that's
[1:13:54] different
[1:13:55] god has a hard time trying to get
[1:13:57] somebody that he can deal with
[1:13:59] that'll stay humble and meek
[1:14:02] and stay in the place until god
[1:14:06] calls him to do something oh he said a
[1:14:08] man that god can bless
[1:14:10] and he'll still keep himself a man and
[1:14:13] not be an angel or a god
[1:14:14] temptations come are you with me
[1:14:18] but notice notice these these very parts
[1:14:20] of these things that we
[1:14:22] study and you look at it this is not god
[1:14:24] keeping him little
[1:14:26] it's up to the man to keep himself
[1:14:28] little it's up to you and i
[1:14:30] to keep ourselves in a place where god
[1:14:32] can use us
[1:14:34] is that right as soon notice as soon as
[1:14:36] a man gets blessed and has a little
[1:14:38] something given to him
[1:14:39] think of that given to him this is not
[1:14:42] even anything that
[1:14:43] that belongs to him or that he's done
[1:14:45] it's given to him like satan's beauty
[1:14:47] was
[1:14:48] he wants to become a god he wants to
[1:14:50] become an angel
[1:14:51] he wants to be some come some great
[1:14:53] person you know like what i do
[1:14:55] me and me and mine that's the wrong
[1:14:57] attitude
[1:14:58] god's hunting for somebody who he could
[1:15:01] bless and pour out the blessings
[1:15:03] and the more he blessed the littler
[1:15:06] the man will become amen
[1:15:09] and then say lord right here lord right
[1:15:12] here that's my desire lord
[1:15:15] it's not just about lord i want more
[1:15:17] blessings lord help me to stay little
[1:15:20] help me to stay small
[1:15:23] notice he says you'll never get more of
[1:15:25] god until you become
[1:15:27] nothing you've got to belittle
[1:15:30] yourself now that don't mean run
[1:15:32] yourself down
[1:15:37] that don't mean to think that doesn't
[1:15:39] mean to you know putting yourself down
[1:15:41] it means that you think less of yourself
[1:15:50] you've got to be little yourself lord i
[1:15:53] i need you look when the lord jesus come
[1:15:57] here is the son of god
[1:16:00] the fullness of the godhead bodily dwell
[1:16:02] in him
[1:16:03] in his testimony i can do nothing
[1:16:08] of mine own self
[1:16:11] but what the father showeth me
[1:16:14] the son doeth likewise
[1:16:18] he had authority but he was reserved
[1:16:22] in obedience to the father's will
[1:16:28] you've got to belittle yourself he that
[1:16:30] will exalt himself
[1:16:31] god will bring a base he that will
[1:16:34] humble himself god will exalt
[1:16:36] you've got to get little before you can
[1:16:38] get big
[1:16:39] and you'll never be big in your own self
[1:16:42] you'll only be as big as god will be
[1:16:45] big in you
[1:16:51] let's look at another king here one by
[1:16:55] the name of
[1:16:56] saul saul was not petitioning to be king
[1:17:01] he was not running around as a matter of
[1:17:03] fact he was hidden he was away
[1:17:06] but god pointed him out we know he was
[1:17:08] anointed
[1:17:09] by the prophet but i want you to notice
[1:17:11] these words
[1:17:13] and samuel said now this is after a time
[1:17:18] saul's now been been serving two three
[1:17:20] years
[1:17:21] he's been his king in the army
[1:17:25] he's there's been a lot of things that
[1:17:26] he said he's put a lot of fear a lot of
[1:17:28] scare tactics you know he's butchered
[1:17:30] the oxen sent them throughout all israel
[1:17:32] you follow me and if you don't follow me
[1:17:34] and samuel
[1:17:35] you're i'm going to cut you up like this
[1:17:36] god's people are not ruled by fear
[1:17:39] the bride is not ruled by fear
[1:17:42] it's by the love of god
[1:17:45] the love of god brings a fear but it's
[1:17:48] not an
[1:17:49] unclean fear the bible says the fear of
[1:17:51] the lord is
[1:17:52] clean is that right so the bride doesn't
[1:17:56] need to be put in fear to get in
[1:17:58] position
[1:17:58] it's the power of god that puts her in
[1:18:00] position she yields to his leading and
[1:18:03] she comes into position
[1:18:04] his son had won a great battle you know
[1:18:07] his son had jonathan had led
[1:18:09] you know against one of the garrisons
[1:18:10] and now once this battle has been won
[1:18:13] saul you know he wants to gather all of
[1:18:15] israel and now it comes time
[1:18:17] for there to be an offering about that
[1:18:20] time
[1:18:20] of the day of the evening there's to be
[1:18:22] an offering that's to be offered up
[1:18:24] and saw you know how the scripture goes
[1:18:27] he got a little nervous
[1:18:29] he said oh my goodness i did this has
[1:18:31] got to be done there's got to be an
[1:18:33] offering
[1:18:33] but you see if god god himself
[1:18:37] will never be late or miss
[1:18:40] one appointment god's never
[1:18:43] missed an appointment in the fulfillment
[1:18:46] of his word
[1:18:48] man has missed a lot of god's
[1:18:51] appointments
[1:18:53] but god has never missed one of his
[1:18:55] appointments
[1:18:56] so he finally saw he goes ahead and
[1:18:58] intrudes himself
[1:19:00] into the office and he offers offers up
[1:19:03] the sacrifice
[1:19:04] and now when samuel comes to him do you
[1:19:07] know all of the
[1:19:08] the report with the battle and that of
[1:19:10] amalek but i want to go right to this
[1:19:12] verse
[1:19:13] to where now samuel speaks to him and
[1:19:15] samuel says
[1:19:16] when thou was little
[1:19:19] in thine own sight
[1:19:23] this is where his this is saul's
[1:19:25] beginning
[1:19:27] it was a glorious glorious beginning
[1:19:30] little in his own sight but what
[1:19:33] happened
[1:19:34] he let his littleness get away from him
[1:19:40] and his littleness it removed to where
[1:19:43] now he was no longer little
[1:19:45] in his own sight and you know one of the
[1:19:48] telltale signs
[1:19:50] as god goes on to say what's thou not
[1:19:52] made the head of the tribes of israel
[1:19:54] and the lord anointed the king over
[1:19:56] israel notice one of the telltale signs
[1:19:58] was saul
[1:19:59] you'll find this this was the same thing
[1:20:00] that took place in heaven
[1:20:02] it's the same thing that begin to move
[1:20:04] all the way through
[1:20:05] is saul himself would report back to
[1:20:08] samuel
[1:20:09] and say i've obeyed the word of the lord
[1:20:13] i've done everything that the word told
[1:20:16] me to do but the real
[1:20:17] truth of the matter is is that he only
[1:20:20] did
[1:20:21] what he felt was important to do
[1:20:24] the rest of it he left undone
[1:20:28] he felt it wasn't important to kill the
[1:20:30] king again
[1:20:32] he felt you know the people they need
[1:20:33] sacrifices hey
[1:20:35] we need sacrifices to offer up you know
[1:20:37] to jehovah
[1:20:38] that's all reasoning the word of the
[1:20:40] lord says go
[1:20:41] and wipe every one of them out
[1:20:45] but because he refused the bible records
[1:20:48] it
[1:20:48] as the word came and just flatly said
[1:20:51] you've rejected the word of the lord
[1:20:53] god did not care if he obeyed 99 and
[1:20:57] nine tenths of it
[1:20:58] the one tenth is where god looked at him
[1:21:00] said because
[1:21:01] you denounced that one-tenth you have
[1:21:04] rejected
[1:21:05] the word of the lord you say well how
[1:21:06] can that be because the word
[1:21:08] is the person of jesus christ himself
[1:21:12] you take away one spec of the word you
[1:21:15] take away from god
[1:21:17] you've rejected the word of the lord how
[1:21:20] did he get to this place
[1:21:21] he no longer was little in his own eyes
[1:21:26] inside that
[1:21:36] may god help us
[1:21:40] let me look at another one just refer to
[1:21:43] this
[1:21:45] using a king in israel
[1:21:48] king of judah when you read this about
[1:21:51] uzziah you can read it
[1:21:52] later but this is one who walked
[1:21:56] according to the word of the lord the
[1:21:57] visions
[1:21:58] that came through zachariah the bible
[1:22:01] said this
[1:22:02] as long as he sought the lord the lord
[1:22:04] was with me
[1:22:05] you see it's just like what was spoken
[1:22:07] to saul
[1:22:08] god's not interested in the parts that
[1:22:10] we want to obey
[1:22:12] god said obedience is better than
[1:22:15] sacrifice
[1:22:16] there can be a lot of things that's done
[1:22:19] but god
[1:22:20] looks for obedience and obedience
[1:22:24] is there in the heart that's why paul
[1:22:26] could deal with them in romans and say
[1:22:28] you have obeyed from the heart the form
[1:22:31] of doctrine that was delivered to you
[1:22:33] it's obedience that god values
[1:22:37] to his word and uzziah here was a man
[1:22:42] that was so instrumentally used of god
[1:22:44] he was a man
[1:22:46] as you can read there in ii chronicles
[1:22:48] 26
[1:22:49] he was a man that stood on god's word as
[1:22:52] a 16 year old boy
[1:22:54] he was anointed king over
[1:22:57] judah he served in the kingdom
[1:23:01] 52 years and he sought god as long as he
[1:23:05] sought god
[1:23:06] god was with him he was stood even the
[1:23:08] political pressures in that time
[1:23:11] he stayed for the word of god it didn't
[1:23:13] matter what anybody else said around him
[1:23:15] you find where the army was built you
[1:23:18] find where military was built up
[1:23:20] jerusalem was built up you find the
[1:23:22] place of eloh
[1:23:23] was restored and built up many great
[1:23:25] things through this man's
[1:23:27] life and his tenure that was there but i
[1:23:30] want to remind you here of a scripture
[1:23:32] that it speaks
[1:23:33] in second chronicles chapter 26 verse
[1:23:35] 15.
[1:23:36] it says he made in jerusalem engines and
[1:23:39] let me go just to the last part of it
[1:23:41] and his name spread far abroad for he
[1:23:44] was
[1:23:44] marvelously helped
[1:23:50] till he was strong
[1:23:53] josiah how did you how did this come
[1:23:56] about
[1:23:57] how did this come about well you know i
[1:24:01] i have these abilities no you were
[1:24:04] marvelously
[1:24:05] helped how did you get where you were
[1:24:09] well you know i
[1:24:10] i just did this and i know you were
[1:24:12] marvelously
[1:24:14] helped the same marvelous help
[1:24:18] is the same one who does marvelous
[1:24:20] things
[1:24:25] god helped him why did god help him
[1:24:27] because he sought after god
[1:24:30] and as long as he sought after god god
[1:24:33] was with him that's a key
[1:24:34] he was seeking after god the bible says
[1:24:38] seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:24:41] and his righteousness and then all these
[1:24:44] other things will be added to you let me
[1:24:46] just tell you something if you've got
[1:24:47] problems in your life
[1:24:48] if you try to seek to resolve them
[1:24:50] problems and you put them ahead of god's
[1:24:52] word
[1:24:53] let me just go ahead and tell you in the
[1:24:54] name of the lord you are not going to
[1:24:56] fix
[1:24:57] one thing because your approach to it
[1:25:00] is wrong it's against god's word
[1:25:03] god said seek ye first the word of god
[1:25:08] if there's something that you're doing
[1:25:10] that's not according
[1:25:11] to god's word don't ever expect for god
[1:25:15] to bless it
[1:25:17] god will marvelously help you he'll help
[1:25:20] me as long as we seek after him
[1:25:23] because when we're seeking after him it
[1:25:26] shows
[1:25:27] we need you lord we need your guidance
[1:25:29] we need your leadership we need your
[1:25:31] lord god
[1:25:32] every day he was marvelously helped
[1:25:37] till he was strong i wonder brother
[1:25:40] aaron till he was strong i wonder if
[1:25:42] this is something that
[1:25:43] god says i've helped you to a place
[1:25:47] josiah you're a good guy now you've been
[1:25:50] in the message for so long you know the
[1:25:52] quotes and
[1:25:52] you know this and i mean you know look
[1:25:54] at you you just you've just been in
[1:25:56] church for so long
[1:25:58] this was not god's thoughts because
[1:26:01] remember
[1:26:03] when we're strong it locks him out
[1:26:08] this is why paul can learn the glorious
[1:26:10] revelation when i
[1:26:11] am weak then i'm strong
[1:26:16] what does it mean to be weak to be
[1:26:18] brought into circumstances and
[1:26:20] situations
[1:26:21] where you recognize the frailty of human
[1:26:24] weakness
[1:26:25] that's god's grace to give unto you and
[1:26:28] i to help us
[1:26:29] master the thought of human ability
[1:26:33] if paul needed that grace how much more
[1:26:36] do you and i need
[1:26:38] he must marvelously help till he was
[1:26:41] strong
[1:26:42] but when he was strong not in the eyes
[1:26:45] of god
[1:26:46] in his own eyes his heart
[1:26:51] was lifted up to his destruction
[1:26:55] for he transgressed against the lord his
[1:26:57] god and went into the temple of the lord
[1:27:00] to burn incense upon the altar of
[1:27:02] incense
[1:27:04] his to think of it he became inflated to
[1:27:07] such a place
[1:27:09] to where he no longer respected god's
[1:27:12] divine
[1:27:13] order you know why
[1:27:16] because he was out of order where did
[1:27:19] that out of order begin
[1:27:20] right in here because he got out from
[1:27:23] his
[1:27:24] place his position
[1:27:29] then he went over tried to take another
[1:27:31] place try to take another
[1:27:33] position now think of this you know
[1:27:37] brother brahman says some
[1:27:38] different things and i just want to just
[1:27:40] drop a few of these things because
[1:27:42] it really pertains to us he said it said
[1:27:44] god took an example like this
[1:27:47] he showed us god will bless a man
[1:27:50] that'll be true to the word of god right
[1:27:53] he said but he got to a place he started
[1:27:57] feeling self secured
[1:28:02] brother aaron you know no doubt feeling
[1:28:05] self security
[1:28:07] he probably was he didn't go to the
[1:28:09] temple and you know take up one of the
[1:28:11] incense and go to start offering that in
[1:28:13] prayer but it was it started out as a
[1:28:15] feeling
[1:28:16] he started feeling secure i wonder if it
[1:28:20] was that uzi
[1:28:21] thought i don't need to pray as much
[1:28:23] i've got a lot of victory
[1:28:25] i don't need to read as much i have a
[1:28:27] good understanding of the message now
[1:28:29] i've got more of the
[1:28:30] of a picture about it i don't have to
[1:28:32] study as much anymore
[1:28:34] then you ain't preaching to me
[1:28:39] you ain't preaching to me because when i
[1:28:41] realized of studying and continuing to
[1:28:43] lay
[1:28:43] to lay before god i cannot tell you you
[1:28:46] know what i'm talking about
[1:28:47] there's times you're listening to
[1:28:48] message after message after message
[1:28:50] sometimes some of the things when i'm
[1:28:52] preaching within a series
[1:28:53] i'll take certain messages and i've done
[1:28:55] this through the years i'll just keep
[1:28:57] listening and listen and listen and
[1:28:58] listen and listen and listen and listen
[1:28:59] and listen
[1:29:00] and just keep putting them on i'm not
[1:29:02] sitting there like this but i'm just
[1:29:03] listening and all of a sudden
[1:29:04] oh wow never heard it like that before
[1:29:06] or you'd be studying you see something
[1:29:08] you come across
[1:29:09] a man i never seen it like that before
[1:29:11] my i never heard it like that before
[1:29:13] that's god opening that up for you and
[1:29:15] me
[1:29:16] when we get to a spot but we feel like
[1:29:19] we don't need to pray as much
[1:29:21] and we don't need to read as much and be
[1:29:23] as dedicated
[1:29:24] we're feeling self-secure
[1:29:27] [Applause]
[1:29:30] god has never told us you're strong
[1:29:32] enough
[1:29:33] tell you what let me tell you how strong
[1:29:35] you are you don't got to come to church
[1:29:37] but about once a month you're a real
[1:29:39] strong fellow
[1:29:42] let me tell you the prophet said you
[1:29:44] can't be as good a christian outside a
[1:29:46] church
[1:29:46] as you can be inside a church
[1:29:51] now i know some people don't feel
[1:29:52] comfortable right now and they're
[1:29:53] streaming
[1:29:54] but i but i want you to understand this
[1:29:56] right here if you can be in the house of
[1:29:58] god
[1:29:58] and even when times resume and how
[1:30:01] things themselves would come about
[1:30:02] that's a choice that you and i are
[1:30:04] making
[1:30:06] hello somebody what happens is begin to
[1:30:08] feel
[1:30:09] a little secure and oh my that's the
[1:30:11] time to recognize
[1:30:12] let the word what should the word do it
[1:30:15] brings us to a place
[1:30:16] to discern that high thing that's
[1:30:18] exalting itself
[1:30:20] against the knowledge of god and cast it
[1:30:23] down
[1:30:25] because it's a spirit wanting to take
[1:30:27] away
[1:30:28] it starts out
[1:30:36] that's where you make your mistake yeah
[1:30:39] bram says
[1:30:41] you've got to continue look at this
[1:30:43] continue
[1:30:44] to serve god no matter what you was
[1:30:48] back 10 years ago it's what are you now
[1:30:53] you can't live off a past reputation
[1:30:56] what are you
[1:30:57] now must continue on
[1:31:00] in serving the lord oh my he he got to
[1:31:03] thinking
[1:31:04] brother around you know what would pick
[1:31:05] this up i i i want to read this
[1:31:08] statement brother m says it like this he
[1:31:10] says
[1:31:11] this king though being a godly
[1:31:15] man as he was he
[1:31:18] felt self-sufficient
[1:31:25] is that did you win those battles
[1:31:29] or did god help you did you build up
[1:31:33] this military did you build up
[1:31:35] that of jerusalem did you do that or did
[1:31:38] god equip you
[1:31:40] who was it that increased your name was
[1:31:43] it your skills that got you that
[1:31:44] position on the job
[1:31:45] or was it god
[1:31:49] come on somebody it's to remember who
[1:31:52] has
[1:31:52] marvelously helped you
[1:31:56] his marvelous help does not make us when
[1:31:59] we can really it brings us to a
[1:32:01] realization
[1:32:02] i need you lord i need you
[1:32:05] more now than i ever needed you lord
[1:32:10] jesus
[1:32:12] said let us always remember we're under
[1:32:13] god we're under his word
[1:32:17] you know he got the feelings secure is
[1:32:18] this okay
[1:32:20] but the brahman said he uses these words
[1:32:22] and i like to follow this
[1:32:24] how the prophet is laying this in
[1:32:25] describing these thoughts he said he got
[1:32:27] the feeling
[1:32:28] secure he just absolutely felt
[1:32:32] anchored like
[1:32:36] i can't go nowhere listen to these words
[1:32:40] there's no way for him to ever fall
[1:32:47] no way there's no way for me to ever
[1:32:50] fall you better get a checkup
[1:32:55] and to recognize it's the grace of god
[1:32:57] upon our life
[1:32:59] brother branham would say it like this
[1:33:00] in this measure when he's talking about
[1:33:02] it because somebody was criticizing
[1:33:04] another
[1:33:04] another minister talking with uzziah as
[1:33:06] well brother brownwood said you must
[1:33:08] remember man cannot order himself god
[1:33:10] ordered his man god makes you
[1:33:12] what you are any man any man is subject
[1:33:15] to mistakes
[1:33:16] he is subject to error because he is
[1:33:19] human
[1:33:20] he's subject to the violations of god's
[1:33:22] law
[1:33:23] he's subject to many things because
[1:33:25] satan
[1:33:26] tempts him and he's just a human being
[1:33:29] and if god
[1:33:30] ever lifted his hands he would fall you
[1:33:33] hear this
[1:33:33] if god ever lifted his hands he would
[1:33:36] fall
[1:33:37] i don't know about you but i want to
[1:33:38] stay in a place that invites his hands
[1:33:41] to be all over my life i don't want to
[1:33:45] move to a place
[1:33:46] to where it's now you feel self-secure
[1:33:49] little things you start doing
[1:33:50] that you would never do before things
[1:33:52] you would never you would check your
[1:33:54] attitude before
[1:33:55] but now you let it go on check you used
[1:33:57] to pray fervently
[1:33:58] but no longer praying fervently anymore
[1:34:01] i want to be in his hands
[1:34:04] i want my life i don't want to live with
[1:34:05] that false feeling i'm
[1:34:07] anchored that's all win with no sales
[1:34:11] that's it has
[1:34:14] no substance behind it
[1:34:18] because i find contrary with apostle
[1:34:20] paul saying i press toward the mark
[1:34:22] of the high calling paul would say like
[1:34:25] this
[1:34:26] let me bring it into the context of how
[1:34:28] it's wrote
[1:34:29] i bring my body under subjection in
[1:34:31] other words beat it black and blue
[1:34:33] i'm not missing when i'm jabbing it he
[1:34:35] wants to raise up
[1:34:36] and i am swinging i am all of these
[1:34:39] things that could rise up i'm swinging
[1:34:41] at it
[1:34:41] lest i myself should be
[1:34:45] a castaway
[1:34:48] let me finish this quote if god ever
[1:34:51] lifted his hands
[1:34:52] he would fall but bremen said i've heard
[1:34:55] people say
[1:34:56] oh satan can't do that he said you let
[1:34:59] god lift his hand one time
[1:35:01] and you watch what happens i constantly
[1:35:05] plead god don't send him
[1:35:09] have mercy on me keep him away from me
[1:35:13] you see i need god's mercy and we all
[1:35:20] constantly pleading lord
[1:35:24] i need you
[1:35:32] let me just leave you with this can i
[1:35:33] give one more example
[1:35:36] in the book of deuteronomy i'm not gonna
[1:35:38] i'll just refer to it you can read it
[1:35:42] you know home devotions and so forth but
[1:35:44] not a deuteronomy 8
[1:35:48] god told them just as simply it starts
[1:35:50] like this
[1:35:51] when you come in the land when you've
[1:35:54] eaten
[1:35:56] an art full
[1:35:59] give thanks unto the lord
[1:36:03] amen begins to go through
[1:36:06] his blessing upon the land his blessing
[1:36:09] upon
[1:36:10] their flocks blessing upon their homes
[1:36:13] but once again he would come back around
[1:36:18] don't forget the lord he said
[1:36:21] lest when you're full what happens when
[1:36:22] you get full
[1:36:24] it doesn't matter if you're fat or
[1:36:25] skinny what happens when you get full
[1:36:28] you get a little sleepy
[1:36:32] is that right some of you afraid to say
[1:36:34] it but it's true
[1:36:36] sometimes you can get you know
[1:36:37] especially after we get done with maybe
[1:36:38] a thanksgiving dinner christmas dinner
[1:36:40] you get done with that and you think oh
[1:36:42] man you just you know you're just laden
[1:36:44] with turkey gravy and you're ready to go
[1:36:46] back and go to sleep you're full
[1:36:50] but you see when you get full it can
[1:36:52] also come a great danger
[1:36:56] you can get relaxed things are provided
[1:37:01] it's going a little bit easier things
[1:37:03] are a little bit easier
[1:37:05] it's a little nicer got a little bit
[1:37:07] more
[1:37:09] but that's a time when we have to guard
[1:37:12] i don't think there's anybody here in
[1:37:14] this room that many times that we can
[1:37:16] look at that you can see things i can
[1:37:17] see from my own from my own perspective
[1:37:19] i can remember at times with things from
[1:37:21] from my parents and what they had to do
[1:37:23] with
[1:37:23] and and the things that was before us i
[1:37:25] remember how things were
[1:37:26] you remember back there in the early 80s
[1:37:28] you know many of you
[1:37:30] remember that of how the interest rates
[1:37:31] on houses and things like that
[1:37:33] it was in double digits and the democrat
[1:37:34] wasn't even in office well maybe that's
[1:37:36] when it was
[1:37:37] but you understand i mean here you had
[1:37:39] these things and they were so in that
[1:37:40] place you couldn't afford nothing
[1:37:42] things were different but look at it in
[1:37:45] a time
[1:37:46] a time of where things are a little bit
[1:37:48] maybe a little bit more plenteous
[1:37:51] not that anybody living high on the hog
[1:37:53] but you understand what i'm saying
[1:37:55] when things big themselves you get to a
[1:37:57] place of where it's full
[1:37:59] you don't need to pray as much as you
[1:38:00] need a lot of times
[1:38:03] you don't need to move as much as you
[1:38:05] did at other times
[1:38:06] but remember that is false
[1:38:10] security we need god
[1:38:14] more now than we ever did
[1:38:18] material things do not make life easier
[1:38:22] if you're not careful material things
[1:38:24] will tie up more of your time
[1:38:27] are you with me it shows how we need
[1:38:30] god's leadership we need his direction
[1:38:34] this word forget is to where we cease
[1:38:37] to care things we just start to
[1:38:40] kind of give away god brother brown
[1:38:42] talks about uzziah and different things
[1:38:44] you know come in
[1:38:46] god wouldn't mind this and god won't
[1:38:48] mind this but
[1:38:50] we need to stay fervent amen before god
[1:38:55] fervent in our lives that every one of
[1:38:57] us
[1:38:59] that when satan wants to try to present
[1:39:01] a thought
[1:39:03] high thing to cast him down
[1:39:06] amen this is why brother branham
[1:39:10] just closed here this is why brother
[1:39:11] bram said you watched he said
[1:39:13] a family he said here's a family he said
[1:39:15] god will take a family
[1:39:18] he said and god will bless him he said
[1:39:20] he'll fill their lives with the holy
[1:39:22] spirit
[1:39:24] and he said pretty soon he says you know
[1:39:27] he says they'll finally they'll
[1:39:29] move out of the neighborhood they were
[1:39:30] in maybe he says
[1:39:32] now they maybe have a nicer house and
[1:39:34] now he said instead of them
[1:39:36] driving he said maybe old junkie cars
[1:39:38] they drive nicer cars
[1:39:40] they you know they used to drive the
[1:39:41] cars that you had to pray to get to the
[1:39:43] store
[1:39:47] now you have to pray to find out how to
[1:39:49] turn them on
[1:39:50] how to turn them off is that right
[1:39:54] you know well which tire the one i got
[1:39:56] to inflate and this and that
[1:39:58] you see how things change it becomes so
[1:40:00] much more convenient
[1:40:02] you don't have to look at your tires
[1:40:03] it'll just let you know the dummy bells
[1:40:05] will go off
[1:40:06] left front tire fill it with air used to
[1:40:09] be before you had to check those things
[1:40:10] and look at it that tire needs a little
[1:40:12] bit of air right there
[1:40:13] now it just goes off you need air
[1:40:17] it's more convenient
[1:40:23] ah you don't have to look go down and
[1:40:25] get the paper
[1:40:26] to see the weather just pick up your
[1:40:28] phone from your nightstand
[1:40:31] but don't anybody start drawing up on me
[1:40:33] now it's convenience
[1:40:36] what does convenience do if we're not
[1:40:38] ignorant of satan's devices
[1:40:40] it's not saying that those things are
[1:40:41] wrong it's to recognize within this time
[1:40:44] right here we need god more now
[1:40:46] than we ever did he has
[1:40:50] marvelously helped us and it's going to
[1:40:52] be his marvelous grace that gets us out
[1:40:54] of here
[1:40:55] amen we need his help every day of our
[1:40:58] life every time when we come to the
[1:41:00] house of god
[1:41:00] we need his marvelous
[1:41:06] god said if you obey my word
[1:41:09] i'll be an adversary to your adversaries
[1:41:13] i'll take up your part
[1:41:18] we want to stay in that place stay in
[1:41:21] that place with god and having
[1:41:23] fellowship
[1:41:24] see how so suddenly these things can
[1:41:27] just you can just move in just something
[1:41:29] just right there in the heart a little
[1:41:32] security
[1:41:33] a little feeling little things that let
[1:41:35] go
[1:41:37] unchecked listen i'm not trying to here
[1:41:40] tonight the spirit of god ain't trying
[1:41:42] to
[1:41:44] come down on you but it's it's bringing
[1:41:46] us to an awareness
[1:41:47] of where we're at in this time
[1:41:50] it's a time to really evaluate our life
[1:41:54] it's a time to evaluate in the midst of
[1:41:56] it and it's a time that you and i
[1:41:57] are given this stewardship god will not
[1:42:00] will not do this for us
[1:42:03] this is why he speaks to us the way he
[1:42:05] does like this this evening
[1:42:07] and he lets us know don't become less
[1:42:10] watchful but watch and pray
[1:42:15] watch and pray look to him he's the one
[1:42:19] who's guiding us
[1:42:21] he's the one directing us we need him
[1:42:25] of all that god has revealed we need him
[1:42:28] more now
[1:42:30] we need him to continue to reveal his
[1:42:33] word
[1:42:34] to our lives we need
[1:42:37] his leadership
[1:42:40] now it's not a time to abandon the holy
[1:42:43] ghost we need the holy ghost
[1:42:44] more than ever we need the angel of the
[1:42:48] lord
[1:42:49] more than ever we need to depend on him
[1:42:52] more than ever we need the wall of fire
[1:42:55] round about us
[1:42:56] more than ever we need you
[1:43:00] i think as the musicians would come as
[1:43:02] we would go in prayer

[1:43:44] relying
[1:43:44] or relying upon ourselves

[1:43:52] but it's something lord god that
[1:43:55] it's how we display that we can we could
[1:43:59] all i think every one of us would say
[1:44:00] well no i don't rely upon myself but i
[1:44:02] wonder lord
[1:44:08] do we pray like we used to pray
[1:44:11] are there things that we seek your face

[1:44:18] that we know you well enough
[1:44:22] oh god i pray here tonight lord jesus
[1:44:28] may dear god there be a real renewing in
[1:44:30] our hearts

[1:44:36] self-security
[1:44:39] feeling lord god strong in ourselves
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:43] may we just show god by the authority of
[1:44:45] the word
[1:44:47] may we cast down that imagination
[1:44:51] may we cast down that high thing and say
[1:44:53] no

[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:24] as it moves around god granted i pray
[1:46:29] there's not one believer lord god
[1:46:31] there's not one of us lord
