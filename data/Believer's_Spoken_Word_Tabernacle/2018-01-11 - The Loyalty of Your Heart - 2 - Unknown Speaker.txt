Lord committing ourselves to you lord over this few moments that we have Lord to look into your word but pray that God that your Holy Spirit Lord that you would come Lord behind your word confirming it Lord Lord to every heart in every life and Lord just ministering to every need that's gathered here tonight Lord we pray Lord we just we give ourselves to you Lord that you would have the right away we love you and we praise you now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you if you turn on me tonight to Romans 8 and most of you got the news we had to just thought it best to cancel and to reschedule that with brother George and because of the weather that we saw that possibly be coming our way tomorrow and as well when I know later tonight as well as tomorrow and then Saturday but I'm just thankful we know that all things are in God's hands we know that so thankful we were able to get that rescheduled and so we just want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord just pray that God will just come and just speak to our hearts tonight in Romans chapter 8 verse 35 I want you to watch how Paul writes this here by the Spirit of God who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl or sword so all of these all of these things that are here when you you consider this here tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness pearl and sword all of those you would think why does Paul use the word who are you with me why would he use who why wouldn't he use things it's because of the one who comes through these things to try to come at us so this this is first of all in just in this scripture alone this is discernment itself who not what who who so it's another person that we try to separate us from the person of Christ we'll ask you who's greater Satan or Christ so the love of Christ is that which God has placed in our hearts by the new birth so what who is it that can separate us from him nothing as it is written now watch this as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things that come Paul has put the whole rank of Satan's army right there doesn't matter what rank it is there's nothing greater than Christ is that right the devil as far as he's more than a match for you and I physically speaking but he's not more than a match for the Holy Ghost that's the truth nor height and then watch this in verse 39 nor height nor depth nor any creature nor any other creature now when you look at that that thought in verse 39 nor - or death what is this dealing with why would Paul even include this and we know it's not Paul riding just by his knowledge but these given this inspiration hype or death deals with perception sometimes our perception is different based on where we're standing is that right perception itself can really change sometimes things can look much different when you get to a certain level so no matter the perception of it no matter how things look no matter how good they look no matter how bleak they look no matter what it is shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord may the Lord bless his word bless you as you're being seated I'd like to continue to speak on that thought the loyalty of your heart we know that within this that Hall is bringing this here this love itself is not a feeling of mind it's not even a feeling in our spirit because we can have a feeling of love within our spirit in our mind but yet that itself will fail but yet this love here that Paul is speaking of is that that agape love of God that love that has been placed within us or born in us by the new birth in our soul it's the actual substance that's there that holds us that keeps us even in the midst of even in the midst of things that where we don't understand in the midst when doubts would try to swirl gloom comes along disappointments happen there is a substance and anchor that nothing can get us away from that when Paul makes this declaration here what shall be able to separate us from the love of Christ who shall be able to separate us from the love of God so if this declaration is made within it we know that there are things that will actually try to come to separate the believer from the love of Christ from the love of God but if that is sown down in our heart by the new birth there is no separating that can take place at all that right nothing at all none no separation and all can take place but it is RIT is that of a the love affair and to think of it how that you know brother Brandon would place it in in different places where he would talk about the love of God of how that during the time when he was asked a question when everything happened where his wife was taken from him his daughter was taken from him and yet within the midst of it they would ask him how is your religion holding you and how are how are you holding on and he says it's not me that's whole hang on he said but he said there is something that struck my whole my soul one day he said the love of God he said to where it's it's held me and it's holding me in the midst of this there was no way that he could actually articulate or explain with words to explain the keeping and the holding power of the love of God it was something that if you want you to think of this for a moment now brother BAM tells us that when Satan came right up there next to that that crib or the bed to where that his little girl was laying and you'll hear brother Brown tell it in many different instances and you'll hear how the brother brems says Satan himself drew near in that moment and he begin to speak to him and remind him of all the healings and there's words that Satan injected in it that the prophet catches later on but those words that Satan was even injecting in the midst of the temptation was as though that it was the Prophet himself doing the healing he said you remember when you healed people you remember when you know you had people this and that and he continues to go through it and then he begins to relate to him as though that it was something you know web as by efforts and merits and works and you did all of this and look how he turns his back on you in the moment of time now remember here the Prophet tells us that that Gate of reasoning in the midst of that time he said everything that he was saying up to that time was exactly the truth is that right he said reasonings was ready it was in agreement but he said at that very moment when I was about to say if that's how he's going to be see in order to say I was about to say it there was a formation of thought that had come together and word was getting ready to usher out but there was something there that was able to correct it before it could ever be spoken what was that the love of God the love of Christ I hope you understand this that was not a doctor that was their doctrines are wonderful but friends doctrines do not bring a bird you with me doctrines can make people who are stood knowledgeable they can quote they can do all sorts of things have a good mind be able to put things together but that's not the experience nor is that the divine love of Almighty God the love of God is something of an experience where Christ himself has moved into your life and your life is changed and when that life and that change takes place listen if you've got the right spirit it'll lead you to the right doctrine you with me many times you know we hear it quoted well I'd rather have the right you know the right spirit and the wrong doctrine then to have the right spirit and the right doctrine you cannot have the right spirit and remain in the wrong doctrine that's impossible because the Spirit of God cannot dwell in error and neither can the Spirit of God in us allow us to dwell in error in doctrine in thought in Word or in deed so here when we when we look at this and when we see it you know if it was just loyalty brother band talks about the term loyalty he said if I was just loyal to that of a denomination he said Lord he said I would have been gone a long time ago you see if you were just if it was just somebody who was loyal to the message because of their doctrines and truths and well it's a good church and you know I really enjoyed you know brother Samuel and I are enjoy this or enjoy that if that's all the extent that the loyalty goes you're in trouble but the loyalty itself has got to be that you have met Christ face-to-face and you know in whom you have believed there is a reality that you are resting on not about that you can put everything together study everything know everything not at all it's about a life that is expressed through your life many times the enemy likes to try to pull things over on people because they can't understand this can't explain this but remember friends there are times for all of that when God wants us to understand when God wants us to see certain things and you know what the only thing that I want to be worried about is what God's bring it to my attention right now those are the things that I want to attend to if I'll give myself to that then all of those other things but I may not understand God will bring to and bring me to that just as I have need of it because God sees it right now that I really wouldn't have much need of it right now it might actually puff up my pride it might makes me more proud for whatever more but God knows just exactly when to give it when I have need of it so we want to be in loyal to be loyal to something as something very very great many times we find that where you can find that people are loyal people can be loyal to a job that's a wonderful thing if you're the one employing it is that right you want them to show up on time but yet you can have people who are loyal to a job but yet they come to the job complain about the boss talk about the boss whether they have us doing this this don't make sense this is ridiculous why they do this they're really not loyal to the job that yet they are coming so loyalty goes deeper than just us coming to something us coming to church us being around the message loyalty is deeper than that it's deeper than us being able to know it quote it be it's much deeper than that loyalty is dealing with life life and life deals with relationship there's no teaching that can teach relationship into you that is something between us and the Lord think of how brother Branham would tell us you know when he's asked a question or he's he's speaking about how that we in our lives would win others to the Lord he talks about how do we win our loved ones he said by you being the lawyer to what you believe so it's being the Lord you and he says staying in that condition and brother Branham actually that quote I'm referring to in questions unanswered 61 but the Branham is speaking of a young person who's setting in the Assembly at that time and brother Branham is pointing out in regards he's I won't call their name right now he said but I see them in the midst of parents aunts uncles everything else they stand loyal and they have the desire to stand loyal to the cause of Christ that's a great thing that loyalty because as we said moments ago when everything was lining right up they're coming against the Prophet at that time all of a sudden he spoke out he slay me but I've said here's what he says think about where it would have been if it hadn't been for that type host think about where it would have been if it hadn't been for that new birth so it shows it wasn't it wasn't the power the ability of all of the all of the great experiences that God had given him those experiences were absolutely priceless they were wonderful but friends listen when you could stack experiences from here clear to the moon and back but if there is not that within your heart and in your life all of the other it only puts that there is a living God and that living God who can stack all them experiences up wants to come and live in you what matters is there something that stands in the midst and the test of time this is where that even where Paul himself would speak think of how Paul would relate this concerning the love of God because we realize that when we have been born of the Spirit of God we have been born of the love of God God is love we have been born of the love of God the love of the truth now rest within our lives and here we are walking in a love affair not something we have to do we don't have to come to church we want to come to church and the Spirit of God speaks to us teaches us admonishes us on the value of things that sometimes we're doing and the Spirit of God will teach us in maturing us helping us to see a greater value wouldn't we see a greater value we come with a greater a greater discipline about our life we come with a greater reverence about our life so right so here Paul would pre would speak and you find Paul speaking of this over and over but Paul would speak of how that his desire in prayer is that how that the people of God there in Ephesus chapter three I believe it is where that they would know the depth height and breadth in Christ that they would know the love of Christ he spoke that they would know the love of Christ that passeth all knowledge knowledge is one thing that is wonderful is it not knowledge is something we must have you have to have knowledge knowledge is necessary the word is necessary that the word will preached and things will be put in order and but yet within that if that's all that it ever goes is just knowledge we hear a good word we hear a message God anoints and that word comes together so my iciness like I've never seen it before but remember the whole working of divine revelation is for God Himself to be able to move in preeminence in our life so in Revelation is struck in our hearts and it's truly been revealed it should come preeminent preeminent means giving first place right away in order to give first place and right away it requires one fading behind because you see God Himself does not work according to even the law of mathematics that he himself has set forth because God says one plus one equals one not one plus one equals two so in order now some of y'all much smarter than me in math you know this in order for one plus one to equal one one of those ones in between has got to decrease that the other can increase so the way that God brings forth that is this Union is to where what is actually going to be seen and portrayed and his desire from our life is that Christ would be the one who's on display that's his work we are his workmanship so to think of how that within this the great love of God that bringing forth that loyalty that breathed beats that of a of a trueness in our life I want to go back into the message three kinds of believers and just move on here tonight the RAM says sometimes believers put to the test not sometimes every time for every Sun that cometh to God must be chastened tried and child trained remember he said the trials the dusty roads the hot Sun of persecution but the loyalty of your heart beats that material till she's ready to come into the mold God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the Word of God living through them so the loyalty now watch this the trial itself coming is not what brings the molding the trial doesn't bring the molding but the trial brings conditions that loyalty itself can come forth and beat material into the right place consistency whatever he desires so there is a need for the trial but when we looking at the trial it's the loyalty that is there that actually under that trial will beat the material what material our character hmm notice he said the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand they Ted they tested tried every Son of God now notice in Romans 5 verse 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God now watch this and not only so but we glory in tribulations also glory we glory in tribulations also how can you glory now I'm not going to deal with the glory part tonight but how can you glory in tribulations ah understanding so here's where knowledge itself understanding coming to us and us submitting to that to where ah oh now I see but just seeing doesn't mean that all of a sudden magically we're just right there we're pliable no it brings us to an understanding wait a minute here I know where I'm standing lord I don't understand everything that's going on but I know I'm in you Lord I'm resting in you I don't know what's gonna come out of this but I am trusting you I need your grace to help see me through knowing that knowing knowing that tribulation worketh patience this sounds like patience has got to be matured so you mean when I receive patients from the Lord I just don't receive automatically your patience is completely perfect your raps already set out and wait on the rest of us no no tribulation worketh patience now that every one of us remember when you first started serving the Lord you know there were things my goodness that God was answering prayer there were things I mean where you see miracles I talk about things that wasn't long durations of time you've seen a prayers answered miracles you say brother send oh why isn't that now well let's first of all go back to why that was at first it's the same way it was in the book of Acts when there were many different ones whom God would have said brought special miracles by the hands of Paul and God would rule I would god right or what those miracles remember God doesn't do a miracle to show off but God does a miracle to declare his presence that what he said I am here to confirm that the experience that he's talking about I am here to confirm that and in our early journeys in our walks in our life as an as a Christian and early on mother's things that God is just confirming and building our faith in my it just seems like my goodness every morning we're eating frosted flakes with angels I mean we're eating Donuts with angels everything just all around and then all of a sudden you think my goodness where did these trials come from where these women persecutions I mean you know there were persecutions that you would shout about when somebody say your Holy Roller well your Branagh might there would be parts about it that you know if it's steam you began at the same time you would say God thank you for allowing me to be identified but yet those persecutions those things will start coming in different angles than what they've ever come before is that right and yet within that God is still molding and working and causing our patience to come forth verse four and patience now what's this tribulation worketh patience and patience experience so there's no tribulation there's no working of patience there's no working of experience you know your experiences are precious absolutely your experience unless in you ever been around sometimes you tell somebody you're experienced and I'm not talking about you know necessarily how that God done a complete work in your life and birthed you into the kingdom because sometimes let me just say this to you sometimes you know when you get to looking at things sometimes people are so beat up because they can't seem to find I don't know the day nor the time but what you have to understand do you know the life for this season that's living out that's what's it that's what it is that's what's important hope you understand what I'm saying so within this on where I was going I'm talking about experiences where you can just say my goodness I'm gonna share this one you know I get the use of meeting tonight I'm gonna share this when I get to the house of God tonight I'm gonna share this with brother so-and-so and you're trying to tell him and tell him what it's all about huh yeah brother that's really wonderful that's good brother praise the Lord that's good brother but you mean you were expecting them to you know swing you know like monkey bars from the chandeliers and say glory that God hallelujah my goodness but you see that experience was for you that experience was called building your faith and we need God to continue give us experiences to build our faith we still need the miracle working God to work miracles signs and wonders and he still the same God who does it again and again we need that - what continue to build our feet the Prophet says I never again the end of third Exodus is his praying he says father every once in a while will you come by our way and perform a miracle that we might know you are with us glory experiences experiences themselves and lives and we can look all across this building tonight and knowing you know and to think of seeing the older even the younger there's experiences within every person's life I like hearing experiences myself long as they don't go too long no I'm just even I like hearing experience I like hearing experiences myself I really do I enjoy you know I remember I told uh you know I've said this many times I remember when we first started doing them the youth meetings there at the house I think back in 2005 and my goodness man we'd get everybody together both John I mean after I got done with Bible study I had him working with Plato in their hands and all those sorts of things I love that how God leads I bring Plato in here for you if he led me to but I mean working with these things but after I get done with Bible study for 45 minutes maybe a half hour all of a sudden is silent nobody was talking nobody I mean and all of a sudden I had to try to say okay you get an activity going here and you know they have to write you know is they're getting activity so I focused you know we also trying to get you know building where people are able to be comfortable around one another not now not now after the Bible study is over I can run in the corner and everybody just keep on going and all of a sudden when they'll get ready leave say oh we want to shake his hand now this is what I'm trying to say within that they're not just talking about playing things and doing this and doing that I'll tell you what what things that excites me and is that when I hear them talking about the Lord and what God is doing in their life and how God is bringing them along that that tightens me up so tight like a string sometimes it's hard for me to go to bed but that's the same way it is with each of us what I'm saying is is that experiences themselves have a way of just somehow just reaching to our heart speaking to us but yet those experiences are so defined for you just like your tests and your trials are defined for you defined for me and patience experience and experience hope think of David there's David he walks in on Goliath but what if he had not had the bear in the lion he's still a believer but those experiences right there had brought such of a patience there within his life that David could stand there and say you know I don't know how to fight this guy with all this stuff but what I know is that he has spoke against the armies of the Living God I don't care how sorry they were I don't care how many pews they were hiding behind they were still the army of God hey man and David said they are God's children and you spoke against God's children daddy man I believe that that's the kind of stand but we ought to take and should we maintain as believers in the Lord no matter how weak or this or that they still you're speaking against God's children now right and David walked out there now notice how the Prophet tells us and I've heard but now see he said David walked out there not knowing what was going to take place but he walked out there why because he could stand on God's Word this was an affront to the people of God let me tell you something it was not David that put Goliath on the ground it was God through a yielded voice of what the tribulation and work patience and patience experience and there he was standing in hope with an expectation that God will bring this thing down to see the earliness in our life was not for naught remember what God David by the Spirit of God I think it Psalms 103 whenever reading on the mercies of God and David begins to speak of how that I said our people he said understood us not the miracles that were done in Egypt they didn't understand what the miracles were all about they looked at the miracles as just do what was big and understand it was God confirming his presence that the same God who is present is the same God who will take you all the way they didn't understand that that God has a desire for the work of his hands but here this hope hope maketh not ashamed David's expectation you know what I don't know how God's gonna do this but this right here has come against I don't know how God's going to do it there can be things where the devil can rattle his mouth against you and you may not feel like you've got an answer come on I hope somebody preach with me you may not have an answer a matter of fact he might slide something your way that you look at and it seems like it starts to move and reverberate through your spirit you find that you're looking at I don't have an answer I don't have an answer but notice there is an anchor that holds in the midst of all those reverberations that I know and whom I have believed I know and you stand there in the midst of that time what are you waiting on inspiration and all of a sudden you'll hear our inspiration it might come through a minister might come on your in prayer you might be listening to a message you might be reading many times this happened to me with things we're out here the prophets voice of a quote that has been said it'll come right to me right then in there but you say we're brothers have a wife doesn't that come right at first I mean I want to be able to stand there and just go prettier but you see it's not based on your pity it's based on loyalty and loyalty is not something that can be pinned down this kind of loyalty that was tried to be pinned down by a man who was in the insane institution oh love of God how rich and pure how measure less and strong his shall forever more endure the saints and angels song hallelujah hope maketh not ashamed David wasn't it this is God doesn't make the expectation that it's a shame that it's confounded but there's an expectation that God Himself is gonna move in this it's just like when you prayed sometimes where you pray things don't happen the way that you've asked for them to happen you're going through a test or trial maybe there's something a sickness or condition a financial need or whatever and you're praying and you're looking at a certain way and it seemed like mine it seems like this Wayne's gonna open and that's not the way that opens but notice within the midst of it standing with an expectation that I don't know how I don't know when but I know that God is in control that's trust that's patience this is what hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us these are realities right this is a reality of something that takes place even as a husband and wife are coming together in a union so that they don't they're not walking off you know and many times at times when I've talked with different and different ones you know I don't want to scare nobody because I don't put any things up like its to be scary but there is parts of their realism that there's a reality this is not Cinderella it is happily ever after but I got to talk about the tests and trials because if tests and trials in the spirit shall bring you together it's gonna be tests and trials in the natural that won't somebody it's easy when everything is going well hey man it's easy to come to church when you feel good and my goodness man where's that devil at but it requires loyalty when you don't when you think you know what tonight I they don't need my man there I'll just stream you know I just believe that God understands my lazy boys more comfortable than mine then that few you know that few can get awful hard and I've got arthritis in my back and come on somebody sometimes it's not about what's convenient for us there's a lot more things that's convenient for us today what have been more convenient how about I just sends you a PDF for the notes I'm going to preach we will leave a we don't even need to have a building now I just send you a PDF of the notes and scriptures and quotes or whatever more but you know what of everything that I can give myself to the Lord but there are things that the Holy Spirit will speak right through here and right in this time that are not even written down there but he'll bring that to light and bring it right down to our lives for what we have needed that is the mind of Christ setting down among us to give us direction that is his love to care for you and I who Lord be to God get that thought out of my mind amen oh yeah hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God this is why because the love of God you shared abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us so it's not just something that has been just somewhat placed there and it's just resting there but this love of God is shed abroad little white button but it spreads it spreads it grows it grows notice of three kinds of believers he said job went through the trials in the tests his children taken everything else taken the church members come accused him of being a secret sinner and tried to say everything against him but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it wouldn't listen to any of it but yet what he was hearing was also affecting you but the effect could not dismember or separate what was in his soul his spirit he became weary all right he became weak but yet this is where the love of Christ proves listen friends how are things proven to be as strong how is the faith listen this faith that God has given to you and I this revelation how is the strength of it tested by the persecution the tests the trials that come our way are you with me this is a loyalty that goes beyond knowledge you with me because just knowing that I ought to go to church that'll fade there's gonna be times when my flesh doesn't want to just like a brother brother John can tell you sitting right here as a minister there's times when the flesh don't feel like sitting down and studying all bullets Sam you know I always want to study well I'm what I'm trying to tell you is that as you're sitting down and here there's things your flesh everything can come against you it can start to be weak and here you are you're waiting on God sometimes listen friends there's inspiration sometimes that'll flood right in here and I can look at it and say dear Lord this is gonna be weeks on end then there's other times of when there's something that'll come and I'm looking at I think Laura I don't know how exactly how to bring this I don't know how to go about it and God will reserve that and keep that back with them that time and all of a sudden when I get here it's like he just pops it and there it comes out but in the midst of that time there's some times where the inspiration flows and it seems like they have just opened the fire hydrant out of here and it's just gushing out yeah so where I can't wait to go to sleep at night so and get up in the morning that's the truth then there's other times where [Music] you'll remember nothing else out of this message [Music] gotta help you connect it right sometimes you don't feel but this is where in those times that we don't go by feelings there's times that I worship because I feel to worship boy I mean I feel I don't matter where I'm at if I want to dance I'm gonna dance how I just feel but then there's other times I don't feel those are in those times where we can say lord I love you there have been many times throughout even this past year and I think of my mama thinking brother Doug different ones there's been times when the waves of missing my dad is hitting me it's hit me so hard sometimes on some of the nights where I just had to kind of I've gotta you know gone away somewhere sometimes it seems like it hits me at hard times but there's one thing I can say in the midst of it when it begins to come tears flow down so thank you Jesus what a comfort you are to me Lord what a comfort you are Lord what strength you are Lord God what would I do with that here what would anyone else for the heart different once it's lost their spouse what would you do if it was not for the Lord or different brothers and sisters that sit right here among us thank God for the strength and the comfort of the Lord amen I love him I love him more now than I did yesterday yeah he's more precious to me right now but he want us when he got ahold of my life way back hallelujah jump didn't listen to any other you know you can hear a lot of stuff but there's a difference in hearing it and listening to it you can hear stuff how do you know - shut stuff off if you don't hear it but to listen to it is to take it in what job was hearing he could come in but it could not reach and separate in his soul job started trying to justify himself right there in their presence he got to talk in their language but he still was not separated from the love of God he no look at this he knowed he had met God's requirements he knows there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him Satan couldn't tell Joe Joe this is foolishness it's all in your head man it's all made up this whole day it's all worked up there's nothing to this why don't you just go on back nope said excuse me you can't talk me out of this because I didn't get talked into it I wasn't talked into this I wasn't schooled into this I know I've met God's requirements so he stood on what he knew what he didn't know he knew that God would make it know the right he was God's prophet and God will make now he don't tell his prophets everything but he'll make known to them what they have need of if God does that way with the prophets how much more you and I God doesn't tell us every little single thing he tells us what we need when we have need of it what's that that's called faith walking by faith mom imon he know it was the devil so right away that that right there that's not going any further I know that's the devil you see there's some times where you have to just stand right on that you know who it is you know who it is by what's being said there right and you judge listen you judge this by the desire that is in your life you with me you judge it by the desire you know what's in your heart by the desire in your heart he knowed it was the devil and as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job but Joe being whipped was not losing the love of Christ where was he with that in his thinking where was he whipped at in his emotions you see God doesn't want you and I being whipped in our mind whipped in our emotions he wants that love of Christ to move out into those other areas and same piece but these are the areas where Satan wants to try to work but those are the areas that you and I have to rule rule but when Joe once struck that revelation 9 that it was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something so these trials it's not the trial it's what is going to be made out of it so the trial is only an instrument the trial is only a tool right I mean when it comes to buying furniture like these pews okay this right here that we had we had this this custom-made years ago right from from my dad brother Richie had had to had that done by cabinetmakers you know what when you look up here I don't see one tool you see it - I don't see a tool not know there's woodworking - my brother brother Dave crest senior he has his own woodshop there at his house this kind of stuff fascinates me because I'll tell you laying carpet doing this and paintin this to me as gifts you say what you want it's a gift yes sir not to me I value those things being in the lay floor I think that's it that's a tremendous gift but I look at this I don't see one tool and yet I know they had to use a router right here no doubt they used a bandsaw in different parts on prior to the joy be able to tell me certain things that they that was done with on this right here and be just by looking at it they may had to do this and maybe had to do this right over here but when I was when I see this I don't see the tools but I know there were tools that were used to make this but you see it's not the tool that's highlighted it's the of the tool the trial is not what the highlight is it's what comes out of the trial it's the product that comes forward God uses many different tools sometimes it's a bandsaw sometimes he uses a router sometimes it's a table saw but all of those are only tools to cut the wood put angles to finish it sometimes it's a sanding now it's all done for one purpose that the end result we can enjoy it I may not see the tools around your life I can look back and look across this assembly here I don't see tools when I look at brother Bill Sanchez I don't see a bunch of tools right look at brother Carlos look a brother Richard look at all the different brothers I even look at you brother you know I don't see craftsman I don't look over brother Joey and say the Walt black & decker I don't see tools what you see is a product that's been formed of tools and yet you know that that individual that individual young tall has went through trial after trial test after test why to make you an out where we are tonight so we're not highlighting the trial we're not glory in the trial we glory because the product that comes out of it his trials was just to make him something once job caught wind of that hidden and amazing God just didn't stop this trial brother you know he just didn't say stop you've already messed up he didn't stop it this is all part of it you see this trial right here is dissolving parts of job it's getting rid of parts of job and need to be gotten rid of Scott knows what he's doing personally even to her job would stand there seemed like his faith is faltering but his soul is not faltering listen to me friends you wonder when you read it in the book of Joe there's the thing where seems like the faith can can go away I'm not talking about the faith and anchoring yourself but I'm because that is an anchor that cannot be part at all you understand me I've got my faith wear it so believe in trusting but it's right here within our mind that right there can see my I can't put this together that's why the Prophet could tell us what the biggest part of our faith is intellectual faith right but don't let it remain there right it starts out that's where knowledge that's where understanding of the word even these things that I'm ministering right here tonight that the Lord would lead us on the service if it stays no more than intellectual faith you'll walk right out of here text me tomorrow call me tomorrow or do whatever you listen friends I don't ever I don't ever put nobody down because they're weeping like that I want you understand this but what I'm trying to tell you is is that God wants us to have understanding now I don't put people down if somebody calls me and they're crying are all upset let's go to the word and let's see what dr. Jesus can do because I'm what I'm interested in is that if they're in that in that place right there there's something that's bothering them something that's troubling let's get among the word let's get the word because the water will stabilize all emotions the wired will cast out all fear that love of God works and not just it to do it for the moment it builds them hope you understand what I'm saying hi I'm not here ministering and pastoring to make a group of people dependent on me I won you're so anchored and established in Jesus Christ because you're going to face you're gonna face tests and trials and whatever more and what happens if the sale or network goes down but there's one network that neither sleeps nor slumbers everything else that can come that network is still active and if you have been activated and baptized in for that network guess what you have access just as much as I do if you need to call him up call him up you need to text him text him you need to twittering twittering who well he wouldn't get down here honey fell I got nowhere tonight well with job once struck that revelation that it was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it and the same thing today he'll try to tell you that these trials and things as your God trying to put punishment upon you it isn't so no sir I realize that this is a recorded message from 1963 November the 24th and as I'm reading it right here it's echoing out not by my voice but by the authority of the Holy Ghost to speak concerning the very things right now that could be present in our lives this word listen friends the Spirit of God upon this word is discernment that's the difference between the inspiration of man and the inspiration of God God's inspiration goes on but notice this this this is important it's not punishment why is that important because any of us in here when you or I have felt in any way we've let God down or maybe I didn't say that just right maybe the way I my demeanor was was not just right if this is something Lord forgive me I it kills you as a believer when you we have in some way fallen short it kills you if it doesn't you need help if they don't bother you you need help brother BAM tells us in a revelation series ran they don't bother me to do this brother REM says you have no more if you have no more conscience than a snake has hips it did have hips at one time but it sinned its hips away you with me so this conscience here it's a why it's a wonderful thing but yet even when we and ourselves know Lord to forgive me but to think about it what if you are I here we are setting intestine trials and the enemy now listen this guy can point out all your failures and all your mistakes he can point out all the reasons that you ought to be punished you ought to be punished because of this you remember how you thought this this guy in digging up stuff years and years ago he will do that sometimes but he'll try to dig certain things up and then try to cause you to believe that you're living under punishment we understand that tests and trials can come to correct it but let's look at what correction is correction yes it's punishment but it is discipline with a vision and the subject in whom is being corrected it's their amendment their interest in mind but not every test not every trial there's correction when we done wrong right we do we get corrected we need to be correcting when we done wrong right but when we get to looking at tests and trials God can permit sickness to come our way but a trial listen my brother's sister a trial itself is not God punishing you God can permit things to come our way to do what bring us back in line but a trial is the molding of our character so even Satan look how he's doing this why Satan knows if he can get this and get this about because he can't tell you what God don't love you see look look at that he can't tell you he's trying to come where he out on certain things like that he'll try to hit you the Binet Rebbe around and say well you know what it's because you're not been too good you know you failed and this and this and this and this why to get you thinking on that get you thinking on that you get you down why would it get us down as believers because our desire is to please him that's that's the ultimate of our life like David said Lord you can take anything else from me but don't take your Holy Spirit from me anything else Lord but don't take your presence from me Oh God brem says it like this I'll leave you on this and we'll pick it up he says it's Satan doing that and God permitting it you mean God God permits the trial absolutely God permits the trial and in the permission of the trial God permits Satan to run his mouth Satan told him he said you removed the hedge it's around joke God said okay but you can't touch his life he touch his flesh and you can't touch his life he came at him and he said you let me have him and I will make you curse you to your face he was encouraged to do so it came so close to where the enemy anointed is why anointed look at all this is happening to you and you're still faithful you still going on no world man it seems like since you started serving the Lord your whole life oh no you just looking out there you ain't seen the love affair in here but everything that she said why don't you just curse God and John died he said you speak like a foolish he didn't call her foolish he said you speak like will see the discernment the desert to separate in the midst of it well was this Satan notice who shall separate me here is the enemy coming in within the midst of that why don't you do this why don't you do that there's a lot of times there's influences that come over way and there's all sorts of suggestions and everything that comes against what God has revealed to us but God's permitting it to temper you to make you see if you're tied to this earth so this is to make me see it's to make you see God permits so the trying tribulation worketh patience but yet in the midst of it God can have you to turn back around and say hey yeah I know we don't walk through a rear view mirror I understand that but I also understand that God by his word would have Israel to look back remember and so God has to let you know sometimes remember who was that that kept you it was I who was that when you felt like giving up who kept you there was I but you see he won't answer and he wants you to say Lord that was you that was you Lord I would have turned loose at the end a long time ago [Music] and so God says we've come through this way then if how bright I brought you this far no we don't understand everything sometimes there's things that it's when God that child try our test is permitted to come our way it's out of our hands but may our hearts our lives be in his aides say Lord whatever tool whatever tool you think I need a router I cut right here if you think I need the table saw whatever you think Lord I need a press if I just need something to press me to hold me in place right now do it it's like those clamps you know they use those clamps don't make a cut plants don't make a cut but clamps hold things so they can be cut to preach a little bit you know how sometimes the experience is out of your life and your testimonies might be the very clamps that somebody can look at it and say my goodness God's faithfulness and what does it do it causes them to stand there as well they see a testimony of Christ living through you and say Lord you made them you're able to make me Lord your grace has carried that safe this far it's carried me well Lord Jesus I'm praying to you what does he do clamps it right down you got to get it clamped pretty good in there I brother Joey if you're gonna get a clamp good and you're gonna try to start moving that on the sole that other piece buddy it's bad news your angle your cuts not going to be right it's not gonna fit right so sometimes there's tough to beat things coming down and God knows how to crack things down by his word he knows how to clamp it down with the witness and experiences within each individual's life hallelujah let's pray Lord Jesus how do we thank you tonight Lord for your word Lord Jesus thank you for speaking to our hearts Lord your God your counsel what not the counsel of man but how that you would bring your word and speak to us Lord calling us Lord to have understanding Lord in our lives lord sometimes the Lord understanding Lord God when things aren't understood Lord sometimes the Lord as individuals things can think what in the world is going on what's happening no wonder Lord that through the Scriptures when it speaks of tests and trials it would deal with our understanding of the thinking not strange count it all joy no wonder Lord God in these things Lord knowing as Paul would say that tribulation worketh patience this understanding Lord and father with this understanding Lord may we not complain on that about the tool Lord God if it's the router you're using the bandsaw that you're using Lord maybe the welding torch that you're using Lord the screwdriver the hammer Lord the clamp that's not what's going to be on display what's going to be on display is what come forth from the tools that were used or you're a faithful master builder we love you tonight Lord I pray that God that may your presence Lord move within every heart in every life Lord for every need tonight that is gathered here Lord under the sound of my voice
