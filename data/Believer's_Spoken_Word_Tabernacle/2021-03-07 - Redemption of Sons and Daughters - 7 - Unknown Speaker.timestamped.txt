[44:37] to first john chapter four
[44:40] i want to say it's so good to be in the
[44:41] house of the lord
[44:44] glad to be gathered together
[44:50] permit us i want you to remember i i
[44:52] don't know if the prayer request was in
[44:54] but
[44:54] because remember brother ray hernandez
[44:56] he has surgery here this coming
[44:59] week for the three places there in his
[45:02] shoulder
[45:03] arm all those areas right there and it
[45:06] was a real miracle that even that
[45:08] you know as i mentioned to you before it
[45:09] was a miracle that he
[45:11] he was able to get that surgery
[45:13] everything through workers comp and
[45:15] thing because there's different others
[45:16] who's been in the company for a number
[45:17] of years
[45:18] and they've never even though they
[45:20] needed something
[45:22] they have not been able to get it so
[45:25] god has certainly worked on the behalf
[45:27] of our brother and we just want to
[45:29] remember him in prayer
[45:30] that's on wednesday so please keep that
[45:33] in prayer also
[45:34] as we mentioned sister sister crest that
[45:36] the lord will just continue to
[45:38] strengthen her and touch her
[45:41] she's recovering from her surgery and
[45:44] also uh
[45:46] sister michelle the family that's there
[45:50] they need continue to need your prayers
[45:53] the lord would comfort them and many
[45:57] times there's things that take place so
[45:58] we don't understand it
[46:01] but we just we committed into the hands
[46:03] of god
[46:04] and we ask god for strength that the
[46:06] lord will just
[46:07] minister because they'll need it not
[46:09] only in the coming days here in this
[46:11] week but
[46:12] there's also days ahead of them i think
[46:16] there's a
[46:17] thing that you know when we prayed about
[46:19] it i just think of the
[46:21] little boy sister michelle's sister
[46:24] there had
[46:24] a little boy who was nine years old is
[46:27] that right sister michelle nine are
[46:29] going to be ten so he's in that
[46:30] in that journey just such a care and
[46:33] relationship that
[46:34] you know he had with his mom just to try
[46:36] to keep her because there's certain
[46:38] things that she
[46:38] dealt with physically and we're gonna do
[46:40] this tomorrow mama we're going to do
[46:42] this and
[46:42] we're going to do that and i don't say
[46:45] that to you to make you sad but i say it
[46:47] that
[46:47] that just would enter in in prayer that
[46:50] god
[46:50] would bring comfort and god would bring
[46:52] leadership
[46:53] in that situation amen so let's just
[46:56] really
[46:57] let's take that upon our hearts and pray
[46:59] with them
[47:00] amen first john chapter 4
[47:05] and verse 13
[47:08] hereby know we that we dwell in him
[47:12] and he and us because he hath
[47:15] given us of his spirit and we have seen
[47:20] and do testify that the father sent the
[47:24] son
[47:25] to be the savior of the world now i want
[47:28] you to think of this
[47:29] as we read this here this morning john
[47:32] is not
[47:32] writing this in a manner of a historical
[47:36] account he's dealing with it he opens
[47:39] the very first part of this
[47:41] the these scriptures is the word of life
[47:44] that we have
[47:45] seen we have handled and we
[47:49] declare unto you
[47:52] just as our fellowship is with the
[47:54] father that that same fellowship that
[47:56] there may be that same fellowship among
[47:59] us to enter into that
[48:00] so it's not something of history
[48:04] that was done but what god did the same
[48:07] god is present
[48:08] to make known i did what needed
[48:12] to be done are you with me
[48:16] when mo when abraham went to the
[48:18] mountain in genesis 22
[48:21] and he spoke remember the word being
[48:24] declared
[48:25] the ram came on the scene that was the
[48:28] same ram that was back in genesis 15.
[48:31] it was the same original atonement
[48:35] but now the word had brought that living
[48:38] atonement that same
[48:40] god was now on the scene to manifest his
[48:43] word
[48:44] so it was not a historical account it
[48:47] was the same god
[48:48] that was standing there present to
[48:51] perform
[48:52] the word that was in abraham's heart
[48:56] okay and we have seen
[49:00] and do testify that the father sent the
[49:02] son to be the savior
[49:04] of the world whosoever shall
[49:08] confess that jesus is the son of god
[49:11] god dwelleth in him and he and god now
[49:14] we know what confession is
[49:16] confession is is not just with our mouth
[49:18] the bible says
[49:19] confession is made from with from from
[49:22] the heart
[49:24] from the mouth but we know the
[49:26] confession itself that there is a
[49:28] depth within that that that confession
[49:30] comes to where it is
[49:32] our life that gives a confession
[49:35] a testimony there's a voice within this
[49:37] blood
[49:38] that speaks so whosoever shall confess
[49:42] that jesus is the son of god
[49:44] god dwelleth in him and he and god and
[49:47] we have
[49:48] known and believed the love
[49:51] that god hath to us that's personal
[49:55] that's personal god is love and he that
[49:58] dwelleth in love
[50:00] dwelleth in god and god in him
[50:04] may the lord add his blessing to the
[50:06] word as you're being seated
[50:12] i like that we have known and believed
[50:16] the love that god hath
[50:19] to us god is love and he that dwelleth
[50:23] in love dwelleth in god
[50:26] and god in him you see
[50:29] god's desire as john would write here
[50:33] was to so make that love known
[50:37] to that of adam's fallen race
[50:41] that god himself not only wrote about it
[50:45] but god in his love he came down
[50:48] to manifest his love
[50:52] by becoming one of us and taking
[50:55] our our sins upon
[50:58] himself and paying that price that
[51:02] then he might send back the holy ghost
[51:05] the love of god into our hearts
[51:08] that would it would respond to the call
[51:12] that has been made you see in order for
[51:14] this this as we were speaking this
[51:16] this love it must be a channel
[51:20] that whereby god is able to express
[51:23] this love in such a in such a manner in
[51:27] a way
[51:27] that it brings a transformation it
[51:30] brings indeed
[51:32] what what the love of god is it brings
[51:34] the result you see
[51:36] the scripture tells us in the book of
[51:38] ephesians that
[51:39] our choosing we were chosen in god
[51:43] in christ before the foundation of the
[51:45] world we were chosen as the bible would
[51:48] go on to say
[51:49] to be holy without blame before him
[51:52] in love that there are spiritual
[51:55] blessings that
[51:56] are poured out within within
[51:59] this place that belongs to us as
[52:02] believers
[52:03] this was this was all done in love
[52:07] and so when we when i look at this and
[52:09] just thinking of it
[52:11] brother branham would say it like this
[52:12] and i just want to refer to these places
[52:14] you can just listen
[52:15] he said god is a lover god is love
[52:19] and god so loved the world when they
[52:22] were unlovable
[52:24] that he gave his son to make them
[52:27] lovable now i want you to think about
[52:30] that
[52:31] we were unlovable
[52:34] we could do nothing in ourselves
[52:38] to make ourselves lovable
[52:42] but god provided for you and
[52:46] i that we might become
[52:49] lovable it's his work
[52:53] it's what he has done it's what he
[52:56] is doing you see this is why it's just
[52:59] such a
[53:00] we can really preach on this this is why
[53:03] here within this scripture you think of
[53:05] where
[53:06] john would write that if god so loved us
[53:10] we ought to love one another and paul
[53:13] would write in first thessalonians he
[53:15] said
[53:16] beloved he said you need no man to teach
[53:18] you to love one another
[53:20] you are talk of god because when we were
[53:24] unlovable god came to us
[53:28] and he made us lovable
[53:31] now he didn't compromise with us but he
[53:34] came to declare
[53:36] and pick out what was really laying
[53:38] there in our life
[53:39] his his word did not come to highlight
[53:42] all of the unlovableness
[53:44] but his word when his word comes it's
[53:46] just a it's a process of it when the
[53:48] word
[53:49] is come it's light light shows darkness
[53:52] but you see when it shows darkness also
[53:55] light is showing
[53:56] there's a pathway out of that darkness
[53:59] it reveals those things that have a hold
[54:02] and it loosens that whole that's what
[54:04] the love of god
[54:06] it comes to do oh my so
[54:09] here as brother brown would go on to say
[54:11] it says he
[54:12] when they were unlovable that he came he
[54:15] gave his son
[54:16] to make them lovable god wants to come
[54:20] down
[54:20] and make love to you he's seeking look
[54:24] at these words
[54:25] he's seeking thirsting hungering
[54:28] and trying to get to some of your
[54:30] starchy hearts
[54:32] to make love to you as a love affair
[54:35] not a law but a love it's only love
[54:39] god so loved so
[54:42] this is one of the the qualities if we
[54:45] can just
[54:45] begin to look at it just a little bit
[54:47] here within the scripture
[54:49] we we recognize god's desire that we
[54:52] that we would walk in line with the word
[54:55] but remember
[54:56] that god's desire and how that it would
[54:58] be laid out here in the word
[55:00] that it comes to bring us into a
[55:02] relationship
[55:03] with him personally it comes to restore
[55:07] what rightfully belongs to the sons and
[55:10] daughters of god
[55:11] you find in one place of the scripture
[55:13] of what we're looking at tonight
[55:15] or this morning it deals with us as sons
[55:18] and daughters of god in that
[55:19] relationship that he is our father
[55:22] then we find in the word that when it
[55:24] comes into that word
[55:26] that is coming forth then it identifies
[55:28] the relationship
[55:30] as a husband and a wife becoming one
[55:33] so the word itself the love of god it
[55:36] calls
[55:36] for a relationship let me just say it
[55:39] personally
[55:39] the word preached in the trueness
[55:42] through the channel
[55:43] of inspiration in this hour does not
[55:45] read reveal
[55:46] jesus christ wanting to be a boyfriend
[55:49] it reveals
[55:50] jesus christ that he wants to be the
[55:53] husband
[55:53] and the lord of your life that he wants
[55:56] to
[55:56] declare himself that i am your father
[55:59] and you are my
[56:00] attributes you are my offspring so we
[56:03] know that any attribute or any offspring
[56:05] it will bear within it the
[56:07] characteristics of
[56:08] of the father itself now you think of
[56:11] this
[56:12] brother and i'm just going to read a few
[56:13] of these places he says when god seen
[56:15] the sin of this world
[56:17] and seen that men was dying without hope
[56:20] and could not be saved
[56:21] yet he knowed that men would love him
[56:25] it strained god and it proved his
[56:28] nature god's nature is love
[56:31] god is love and it strained god's
[56:34] nature until he had to provide a way of
[56:37] escape
[56:38] for those who wanted to escape he sent
[56:41] his son into the world
[56:43] and made in the likeness of sinful flesh
[56:45] to bear our sins
[56:46] and sickness to calvary god did it the
[56:49] love of god going out
[56:50] called for sovereign grace he said now
[56:53] god never said
[56:54] if you'll do this if you'll do this i'll
[56:57] do
[56:58] this he said god without any conditions
[57:01] he sent his son to die in your place
[57:05] and settle the sin question had nothing
[57:08] to do
[57:09] with what you think about it god did it
[57:12] anyhow you see divine love put a strain
[57:16] sovereign grace has to take his place
[57:18] that's all there is
[57:20] when divine love is set at the right
[57:22] place you see
[57:23] if it would have been left up to you and
[57:25] i even though
[57:26] within our lives as brother branham said
[57:28] here god knew
[57:30] there would be those how they would love
[57:32] him but
[57:33] there was no strength the bible says
[57:35] when we
[57:36] were in due time without strength and to
[57:39] thank god
[57:40] knowing you and i we would not even have
[57:42] the confidence to be able to even
[57:44] lift our head we would not even have
[57:47] that part about us to be able to even
[57:49] look
[57:49] is there a way back but god himself
[57:52] knowing that there would be a desire
[57:54] within the sons and daughters of god to
[57:56] come back home
[57:57] because that's where they belong in him
[57:59] then he himself
[58:00] is the one who would make a way he would
[58:03] confirm that way
[58:04] and he would reveal that way and let me
[58:07] tell you something
[58:08] him doing that his presence his
[58:11] life his nature is accompanied with that
[58:14] word
[58:15] to bring about a faith and to energize
[58:18] our hearts
[58:19] in what love is calling for grace steps
[58:22] in
[58:22] and says i will bring to pass what love
[58:26] is calling for amen in the book of
[58:29] deuteronomy when god would speak to the
[58:31] children of israel
[58:32] when he had brought them out this is a
[58:34] book very important
[58:36] because remember they had fallen in the
[58:38] wilderness
[58:39] many of them had been overthrown they
[58:41] looked at the giants they become
[58:43] discouraged
[58:44] and god would take through the book of
[58:46] deuteronomy
[58:47] he would let them know the seriousness
[58:49] of abiding in the word
[58:51] he would let him know that there's a
[58:52] blessing if you abide in this word
[58:55] there is protection there god god is
[58:58] letting them know in deuteronomy
[58:59] i have everything covered i'm all that
[59:02] you have need of
[59:03] and god would even take provisions in
[59:05] the book of deuteronomy
[59:06] to encourage the people of god god would
[59:09] lead them even into
[59:10] battles that prior to them crossing the
[59:13] jordan
[59:14] they would take on all the king of
[59:16] bashan they would deal with different
[59:18] ones like that why
[59:19] there were battles in order to build
[59:21] their faith as they would come in the
[59:22] land
[59:23] it's no different what god has done with
[59:25] your life and with my life even when god
[59:28] gets a hold of a life and god begins to
[59:30] work what's happening
[59:31] there are battles that are being won and
[59:34] god is building
[59:35] faith in the hearts of his children
[59:37] there is not a church that can do that
[59:39] there's not a man that can do that but
[59:42] that is god himself stepping up
[59:44] and taking responsibility for his word
[59:47] and his children
[59:48] that are on earth in this hour it's god
[59:50] who moves
[59:51] to stir you and i into battle and to
[59:53] stand there on the word
[59:55] and say god is faithful he would remind
[59:59] him
[59:59] in the book of deuteronomy oh i got to
[1:00:02] read this
[1:00:02] in deuteronomy 7 6 for thou art a holy
[1:00:06] people
[1:00:06] unto the lord thy god the lord thy god
[1:00:09] had chosen thee to be a special people
[1:00:12] give me a little more up here please
[1:00:14] unto himself above all people that are
[1:00:16] upon
[1:00:17] the face of the earth the lord did not
[1:00:20] set
[1:00:20] his love upon you nor choose you
[1:00:24] because you were more in number than any
[1:00:27] people or you were the fewest of all
[1:00:29] people in other words
[1:00:31] god didn't look at you and say man
[1:00:33] they're greater than any other people in
[1:00:35] the earth
[1:00:36] neither did god look down and say oh
[1:00:38] they're so sorry and so sad let me just
[1:00:40] tell you something
[1:00:41] the gospel does not come it's not a work
[1:00:43] of pity
[1:00:44] you see a work of pity is somebody's
[1:00:47] trying to pity you
[1:00:48] for something that they can't help you
[1:00:50] with god's letting them know
[1:00:52] i didn't choose you because you were
[1:00:54] able
[1:00:56] neither did i choose you because you
[1:00:58] lacked ability
[1:00:59] i chose you because there's a covenant
[1:01:02] that i had in mind you know what he's
[1:01:05] letting him know
[1:01:06] you got nothing to do with this this is
[1:01:09] my choosing
[1:01:13] oh glory when we can rest in that it
[1:01:15] allows us to step back
[1:01:17] and allows him to step forward the lord
[1:01:20] did not set his love upon you
[1:01:22] nor choose you because you were more in
[1:01:25] number than any people
[1:01:26] for you were the fewest of all people
[1:01:28] but because the lord
[1:01:30] loved you and because he would keep the
[1:01:32] oath
[1:01:33] which he had sworn unto your fathers
[1:01:35] hath the lord brought you out
[1:01:37] with a mighty hand and redeemed you out
[1:01:39] of the house of bondman
[1:01:40] from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
[1:01:43] god is reminding them
[1:01:45] that it was it was me standing with the
[1:01:49] oath
[1:01:49] of the word that i gave to my
[1:01:53] people now i want you to think of this
[1:01:56] here
[1:01:56] very very simple brother brown would
[1:01:59] pick this up here and i
[1:02:00] i want to read these parts out of divine
[1:02:02] love
[1:02:03] he said you know he talks about this
[1:02:05] possum that comes up
[1:02:07] now many of you have heard this story if
[1:02:09] not all of you
[1:02:11] but brother branham here he is he's
[1:02:12] standing in his in his house
[1:02:15] and he's getting ready now to go outside
[1:02:17] it's daylight
[1:02:19] and he walks he sees what's coming up
[1:02:21] the walkway
[1:02:22] it came through his gate it come through
[1:02:25] the gate to come
[1:02:26] in right up the hat right up the the
[1:02:29] pathway
[1:02:30] brother graham sees this possum now he
[1:02:32] knows brother brad knows enough about
[1:02:34] nature
[1:02:34] that this is awful strange because
[1:02:37] opossum
[1:02:38] is blind in the daylight are you with me
[1:02:42] and so as the possum comes up he knows
[1:02:45] there's something going on and he looks
[1:02:47] and he sees the condition of that possum
[1:02:50] it had
[1:02:50] maggots all over it billy graham said he
[1:02:53] couldn't even
[1:02:54] walk right its leg he said whether
[1:02:56] whether a dog had got a hold of it
[1:02:58] or whether a car had got a hold of it
[1:03:00] and hear it come walking right up there
[1:03:03] at that time now here's what brother
[1:03:04] brown tells us here let me just let me
[1:03:06] just slow it here
[1:03:07] he says now he said think of the
[1:03:09] gumption here
[1:03:10] of that of that of that possum she had
[1:03:13] gumption look at this
[1:03:14] she had gumption enough to follow the
[1:03:17] leading
[1:03:18] of the spirit if god could send a possum
[1:03:22] by divine grace and love to protect her
[1:03:24] babies
[1:03:25] how much more will he think of you and
[1:03:27] me tonight if you'll give if we'll give
[1:03:29] him
[1:03:30] our whole heart of love our surrendered
[1:03:32] will everything to him
[1:03:34] he will project to us his sovereign
[1:03:37] grace
[1:03:37] will have to take place and he'll if
[1:03:40] you'll give him
[1:03:42] that love well how can i give him the
[1:03:44] love that he's requiring
[1:03:46] he's manifesting the love that he has
[1:03:50] towards you that's what the word itself
[1:03:52] comes to do
[1:03:53] you see it's not a historical account
[1:03:55] many can look back to calvary
[1:03:57] and they can look back to it it's
[1:03:59] ministered it's preached
[1:04:00] but it's not a historical account it's
[1:04:03] something to be made
[1:04:04] and brought present and to realize if he
[1:04:06] went to calvary
[1:04:08] and he paid the price and then he sent
[1:04:10] back the holy ghost
[1:04:11] there is a reason that he did what he
[1:04:14] did
[1:04:15] his desire was to be united with me to
[1:04:18] change my life
[1:04:19] not that i would just look upon him and
[1:04:22] have a good thought about him
[1:04:23] i would get warm fuzzy feelings but that
[1:04:26] they would actually come forth
[1:04:28] the life in that blood cell that was
[1:04:30] needed
[1:04:31] in order to change my life how can that
[1:04:34] be
[1:04:34] the love of god must be manifested
[1:04:38] now i want you to think of this he says
[1:04:41] now think of it here let me go on and
[1:04:42] read this
[1:04:43] he said thank oh oh god may the center
[1:04:46] man
[1:04:47] boy woman or girl who has been divinely
[1:04:50] led
[1:04:50] to this place of worship tonight let
[1:04:53] them know
[1:04:54] right now that it is your spirit that
[1:04:56] has led them here
[1:04:57] for no other purpose but to come and
[1:05:00] serve you
[1:05:01] oh he said speak to their hearts just
[1:05:03] now may they send forth from their heart
[1:05:06] the divine love of god in appreciations
[1:05:10] of you leading them here notice may they
[1:05:12] send forth
[1:05:13] from their heart the divine love of god
[1:05:15] for the appreciations
[1:05:17] of you sending them here that's what i
[1:05:19] want to do don't you i do receive that
[1:05:21] of the love of god
[1:05:22] and notice how can you how in you how in
[1:05:25] the world could you and i
[1:05:26] do this it would have to be that the
[1:05:29] divine love of god
[1:05:30] is expressed in its death you see this
[1:05:33] is why the word
[1:05:34] when it has been preached down through
[1:05:36] the ages it is not a word that just
[1:05:38] leaves us in a manner of love on the
[1:05:41] filial realm
[1:05:42] because people can love god in their
[1:05:44] spirit they can love his word
[1:05:46] they can love a lot of those things love
[1:05:47] church love that but yet they really
[1:05:49] don't love
[1:05:50] god down in their soul when the love of
[1:05:54] god has come down in the soul
[1:05:55] it reflects itself within that life well
[1:05:58] how in the world can it ever come to be
[1:06:01] first of all it's to be ordained for
[1:06:03] that and then it will require the same
[1:06:06] word that love manifested to you and i
[1:06:09] through a designated dedicated ordained
[1:06:12] channel of god for the inspiration of
[1:06:14] god to flow through in that hour
[1:06:17] is that right now notice may they send
[1:06:20] forth
[1:06:20] from their heart the divine love of god
[1:06:23] in appreciations of you leading them
[1:06:26] here and sovereign grace will send a
[1:06:28] message back
[1:06:30] the saving message of the lord thy sins
[1:06:32] may be a scarlet
[1:06:34] now they are white as snow granite
[1:06:36] father
[1:06:37] we ask it in the name of jesus christ he
[1:06:39] goes on
[1:06:40] what caused you mr or mrs to come to the
[1:06:43] meeting tonight
[1:06:44] it was the same god that stopped the
[1:06:47] animals in the field
[1:06:48] it's the same one look how he brings
[1:06:50] this it's the same one who led the old
[1:06:52] mother possum
[1:06:53] who's done all the things that's love
[1:06:55] god
[1:06:56] so loved you that he led you to a place
[1:06:59] where you could accept him
[1:07:01] oh he said will you do it upon the basis
[1:07:03] of the shed blood
[1:07:04] of his beloved son god could do nothing
[1:07:07] else
[1:07:07] his great love constrained him in such a
[1:07:10] way
[1:07:10] that he could not do anything else he
[1:07:13] sent you
[1:07:14] a savior and if you're loved look at
[1:07:16] this if your love to god
[1:07:18] will be the same way that his love was
[1:07:21] to send jesus
[1:07:22] your love will draw jesus to you and you
[1:07:26] can be saved so it's to receive that
[1:07:30] love
[1:07:30] not reason with it not that's this is
[1:07:32] not that love
[1:07:33] that love that will come out here that's
[1:07:36] in that affection gay
[1:07:37] this is not that love that operates in
[1:07:39] the gate of affection
[1:07:40] this is the divine love the highest of
[1:07:43] all
[1:07:43] it is that of agape love can a man get
[1:07:46] there
[1:07:47] no a man must be brought there by god
[1:07:50] himself
[1:07:50] but that is where you and i are ordained
[1:07:53] to
[1:07:53] or ordained to live this is where as a
[1:07:56] son and daughter of god
[1:07:57] by the baptism of the holy ghost we live
[1:08:00] holy
[1:08:01] without blame before him in love does it
[1:08:03] mean that we won't make mistakes that's
[1:08:05] not what it's saying at all
[1:08:06] but our soul is dwelling in the blood
[1:08:09] covenant
[1:08:10] our life has been changed and there is a
[1:08:12] perfection within our life
[1:08:14] we are standing before him in
[1:08:23] i love know about you but there's
[1:08:24] something i discovered i got turned
[1:08:26] around here
[1:08:27] about that possum the other day in
[1:08:28] prayer
[1:08:30] you know sometimes you listen you're
[1:08:31] listening listen and listen listen
[1:08:33] listen listen
[1:08:34] and i begin to think about that and i
[1:08:36] you know when i look at how
[1:08:38] that brother browner had different ones
[1:08:40] who were around
[1:08:42] and they looked at that possum sister
[1:08:44] woods was one of them
[1:08:45] she looked at that blossom and they
[1:08:47] seemed the condition that possum was in
[1:08:50] remember it couldn't even walk right it
[1:08:52] had maggots
[1:08:53] on it brother branham put a rake over
[1:08:55] because he didn't know
[1:08:56] what was wrong with him and you had
[1:08:58] different ones telling
[1:08:59] brother randall go ahead and kill it you
[1:09:01] got to kill it and it's got babies you
[1:09:02] got to kill it
[1:09:03] that listen that's the most humane
[1:09:06] sensible
[1:09:07] thing to do and brother branham said
[1:09:10] looking at it he says
[1:09:11] i can't do that he says i'm a hunter i
[1:09:13] ain't a killer
[1:09:14] he begins to look at it and he says you
[1:09:16] know he said truly
[1:09:18] it would have been the right humane
[1:09:21] thing to do
[1:09:22] it would have been the sensible thing to
[1:09:24] do he said but there was something
[1:09:26] down in me that wouldn't let me do it
[1:09:29] let me tell you something
[1:09:30] god would have smoked the earth with a
[1:09:32] curse but god had a promise
[1:09:34] in his word my brother and sister god
[1:09:37] would have wiped this whole thing out
[1:09:39] but the mercy of god
[1:09:40] in this hour an age of darkness an isle
[1:09:44] of violence
[1:09:45] you and i may be broken parts in our
[1:09:47] lives walking around
[1:09:48] covered over with the maggots of the
[1:09:51] world but
[1:09:52] god himself who is rich in mercy said
[1:09:55] let me have that life
[1:09:56] i can take that life i can change it
[1:09:59] i'll transform it
[1:10:00] into a trophy of my grace hallelujah he
[1:10:05] did not
[1:10:05] it was not the possum that brought
[1:10:07] herself there
[1:10:09] she followed the leading of the lord
[1:10:14] and of a dumb animal can just be
[1:10:17] simple enough to follow the leading of
[1:10:20] the lord right now
[1:10:22] oh god help me to be dumb enough
[1:10:30] the bible would say behold
[1:10:33] what manner of love that the father hath
[1:10:36] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:10:38] called the sons of god
[1:10:42] it didn't ask if you wanted to be called
[1:10:44] the son of god or a daughter of god
[1:10:46] matter of fact god didn't even ask you
[1:10:47] if you want to be a son
[1:10:48] or a daughter of god did any of you ask
[1:10:51] did you
[1:10:52] did any of you did your mom and dad ask
[1:10:53] you if you wanted to be born
[1:10:56] did they god didn't ask you if you
[1:10:58] wanted to be a son and daughter of god
[1:11:01] it was not something that god had to
[1:11:03] consult with you
[1:11:05] it was already a decision it's what was
[1:11:08] already
[1:11:08] in him it was what was already
[1:11:12] in him but now god comes to confirm
[1:11:15] that word well how's he going to confirm
[1:11:17] that word he cannot
[1:11:19] call you by anything less than what he
[1:11:22] knows you
[1:11:23] to be you may never have seen yourself
[1:11:26] as the son and daughter of god and truth
[1:11:28] be known
[1:11:28] we're coming more and more into that
[1:11:31] place
[1:11:31] denying our own thoughts our own
[1:11:33] feelings we come more
[1:11:35] into that solid ground of the sacred
[1:11:37] sands of god's grace
[1:11:38] where we stand and say lord i just rest
[1:11:41] in the work
[1:11:42] that you've done in my life i don't try
[1:11:44] to
[1:11:45] reason it put my mind there i rest in
[1:11:47] what you have done
[1:11:49] that is the sure grounds of reality
[1:11:51] where the spirit of god
[1:11:53] comes upon the seed to quicken that life
[1:11:56] he called us sons and daughters of god
[1:12:00] are you with me it has to be a word that
[1:12:04] goes out to let us know who we are
[1:12:07] has to let us know who we are and what
[1:12:10] we are called to
[1:12:11] this is why when paul would write there
[1:12:14] in second corinthians
[1:12:16] and it'd be such a pivotal pivotal
[1:12:19] scripture there even in in the bible
[1:12:21] wherein
[1:12:22] that god himself as paul would declare
[1:12:26] he has made us ministers of
[1:12:29] righteousness
[1:12:30] he has made us as paul would say able
[1:12:33] ministers
[1:12:34] able by what abel by his spirit endued
[1:12:37] with the holy spirit that same word that
[1:12:41] god has given
[1:12:42] that it's not the man's word it's not a
[1:12:45] man's words that's changing us let me
[1:12:46] just say it like this
[1:12:48] god in this hour friends for the need
[1:12:50] and what was called for
[1:12:52] it was not enough just to give you and i
[1:12:54] just just
[1:12:55] you know what had already been going on
[1:12:57] but god in this hour in order for there
[1:13:00] to be a union
[1:13:01] and to come back for the church would
[1:13:03] come back into a full
[1:13:05] maturity into a true word birth god
[1:13:08] needed a designated channel now listen
[1:13:10] to me
[1:13:10] he's needed a designated channel down
[1:13:13] through the ages
[1:13:14] when you read in the book of revelations
[1:13:16] let he that
[1:13:18] hath and ear to heal not them he
[1:13:21] that hath an ear to hear because god
[1:13:23] will have a
[1:13:24] trumpet that will sound out and will
[1:13:27] actually sound forth the message and
[1:13:30] there
[1:13:30] are those who are ordained to hear the
[1:13:33] voice of god and they respond to that
[1:13:36] call
[1:13:36] so god in this hour the call is for the
[1:13:39] manifestation
[1:13:40] of the sons of god god would have to
[1:13:42] have a vessel or a life
[1:13:44] because here is the position of the word
[1:13:46] that would be so inclined
[1:13:48] with god to wear the very words that
[1:13:51] would be spoken
[1:13:52] heaven itself would echo back the same
[1:13:55] words
[1:13:55] that were spoken on earth is that right
[1:13:58] that's revelations 12.
[1:13:59] it would be spoken and echoed back
[1:14:01] because this
[1:14:02] is the word of the homeland this is
[1:14:05] where the children of god are called
[1:14:07] into a full maturity in this hour you
[1:14:10] understand we're not called just to
[1:14:11] justification
[1:14:13] just to believe in the resurrection of
[1:14:15] the lord jesus christ
[1:14:16] with we are that plus we're not called
[1:14:18] just to suggest
[1:14:20] to sanctification it's not called just
[1:14:22] to that
[1:14:23] of the baptism of the holy ghost with
[1:14:25] the gifts it's called to the very
[1:14:27] indwelling the token itself of that
[1:14:30] personal life
[1:14:31] of jesus christ dwelling within the body
[1:14:34] amen so now when we look at this
[1:14:38] god himself has made abel
[1:14:41] ministers so it's not it's not the men
[1:14:44] it wasn't
[1:14:44] it's not brother branham's words it's
[1:14:47] god's words that he spoke
[1:14:49] it's not the men as far as our words
[1:14:51] that spoke
[1:14:52] matter of fact we have no other message
[1:14:54] to proclaim
[1:14:55] we stand upon that word that god has
[1:14:58] already vindicated with his presence
[1:15:00] are you with me and to thank the power
[1:15:03] of this word
[1:15:04] when god would begin to reveal this to
[1:15:06] the prophet brother branham would sit
[1:15:08] out there in the woods
[1:15:09] and he goes through this and speak to
[1:15:10] this mountain in los angeles california
[1:15:12] he speaks of how that god began to deal
[1:15:15] with his heart
[1:15:16] and brother branham was looking there
[1:15:17] and he thought my goodness you know here
[1:15:19] come the first squirrel
[1:15:20] when that squirrel was spoken here that
[1:15:22] squirrel came out but he said i wanted
[1:15:24] to just see
[1:15:25] he said i thought i'm going to take a
[1:15:27] place where there ain't no way a
[1:15:29] squirrel
[1:15:30] will come out of a squirrel itself would
[1:15:32] not live
[1:15:33] in this type of a condition a certain
[1:15:35] tree and certain things like that
[1:15:37] and he spoke by the authority of god's
[1:15:39] word and he said there'll be a squirrel
[1:15:41] come out right over there i remember the
[1:15:42] kind of tree bush and everything like
[1:15:44] that
[1:15:45] squirrels do not live in those kind of
[1:15:47] places but you see what the word spoken
[1:15:50] in authority it would speak forth those
[1:15:52] things which the rest could say
[1:15:54] ain't no way ain't no impossible let me
[1:15:56] bring it down to our life you might as
[1:15:58] well forget about their life
[1:15:59] any human sensible thing just go ahead
[1:16:01] and get rid of them
[1:16:02] they'll never overcome they'll never be
[1:16:04] victorious but there's a word that went
[1:16:07] for brother
[1:16:07] because out of our life there has been a
[1:16:10] son
[1:16:11] and daughter of god oh it might have
[1:16:13] been so black
[1:16:14] it might have been so marred there might
[1:16:16] be so many things
[1:16:17] about our life and everybody would have
[1:16:20] wrote us
[1:16:20] off but god said i can't write you off
[1:16:23] of the poems
[1:16:24] of my hand you are there in my mind
[1:16:27] you're part of my
[1:16:28] dreams and the word went forth and here
[1:16:31] you come
[1:16:36] now the lord is that spirit
[1:16:39] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:16:42] there's
[1:16:42] liberty amen we all with open
[1:16:47] face beholding as in a glass
[1:16:50] the glory of the lord are changed
[1:16:54] into the same image from glory to glory
[1:16:58] even as by the spirit of the lord
[1:17:01] so there's a liberty the spirit of god
[1:17:05] ringing out within his word it's a
[1:17:08] liberty
[1:17:11] the love of god it rings out in liberty
[1:17:15] brother branham would take this and i've
[1:17:16] read this quote to you many many times
[1:17:19] and he would deal with here in the
[1:17:20] message shalom how the spirit of god
[1:17:24] the pillar fire moving amongst the
[1:17:26] people and he would speak
[1:17:28] and say we're so happy for this
[1:17:30] privilege that we can
[1:17:31] thank in our hearts that we are sons and
[1:17:34] daughters
[1:17:35] of yours to see you strictly identify
[1:17:38] yourself
[1:17:39] in the midst of us that you are our
[1:17:42] father
[1:17:43] changing our thoughts from the things of
[1:17:46] the world
[1:17:48] where's he dealing soul he's the one
[1:17:52] identifying himself that he's our father
[1:17:56] now you knew however you had come in
[1:17:58] here whether at any time
[1:18:00] but you see god himself begins to deal
[1:18:03] with the thoughts begins to deal
[1:18:05] with what is already down there in the
[1:18:08] soul
[1:18:09] remember he's trying to get that first
[1:18:11] nature
[1:18:12] and that spirit to agree with him
[1:18:17] he's changing our thoughts from the
[1:18:20] things of the world hey listen
[1:18:22] there's many of you sitting right here
[1:18:24] that there's things that you could have
[1:18:26] went back a year ago
[1:18:27] two years ago and other things you
[1:18:29] didn't have the thoughts that you've got
[1:18:30] right now
[1:18:31] you didn't even have even to even be
[1:18:33] inclined
[1:18:34] in that way to even entertain that of
[1:18:37] what god was doing
[1:18:38] there was but god himself moving
[1:18:42] god moving by way of his word changing
[1:18:45] our thoughts
[1:18:46] from the things of the world changing
[1:18:48] our motives and objectives and
[1:18:50] attitudes and every phase
[1:18:53] of us to love you to believe you
[1:18:56] and know that your promises are true
[1:19:00] you know god has always he's always been
[1:19:02] hidden
[1:19:03] and he'd reveal he reveals himself in
[1:19:06] very odd
[1:19:07] peculiar ways the bible tells us here
[1:19:11] in john 14 15 if you love me
[1:19:15] keep my commandments and i will pray the
[1:19:18] father
[1:19:18] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:19:21] that he may abide with you forever
[1:19:22] notice
[1:19:23] if you love me even the spirit of truth
[1:19:27] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:19:30] seeth him not
[1:19:31] neither knoweth him so without seeing
[1:19:35] him
[1:19:36] it can never receive him so he must
[1:19:39] manifest
[1:19:40] himself his love his word
[1:19:43] and when that is made manifest as he is
[1:19:46] dealing with the heart
[1:19:47] in the spirit of truth that is god
[1:19:49] himself taking his word
[1:19:51] and he is unfolding himself and speaking
[1:19:54] to our hearts
[1:19:55] it's not just a word it's not a lesson
[1:19:58] but it's god dealing personally
[1:20:00] with our hearts but you know him
[1:20:04] for he dwelleth with you and shall be
[1:20:07] in you he says i will not leave you
[1:20:10] comfortless i'll come to you or what an
[1:20:13] assurance
[1:20:16] yet a little while and the world seeth
[1:20:18] me no more but you see me
[1:20:20] because i live you shall live also at
[1:20:23] that day you shall know
[1:20:25] that i am in my father and ye and me and
[1:20:27] i and you
[1:20:28] he that hath my commandments and
[1:20:32] keepeth them he it is that loveth me
[1:20:36] and he that loveth me shall be love
[1:20:39] of my father and i will love him and
[1:20:42] will manifest myself to him
[1:20:44] this is a love affair amen
[1:20:47] he will never he'll never come and
[1:20:50] reveal himself
[1:20:51] without love but in order
[1:20:55] for that love to be he reveals himself
[1:20:58] in love you realize even when god
[1:21:02] as god would come around and as we said
[1:21:04] when the light
[1:21:05] is expressed light will show up darkness
[1:21:08] light will show up error
[1:21:09] light will show up those things that
[1:21:11] which is hindrance
[1:21:13] what's that light coming to do it's
[1:21:14] coming to press
[1:21:16] back the darkness that the seed
[1:21:19] that is there on the inside might come
[1:21:22] forth
[1:21:23] under the authority of the light and
[1:21:26] bear the image
[1:21:27] of that which it always truly
[1:21:30] was
[1:21:33] he it is that loveth me and he that
[1:21:36] loveth me
[1:21:37] shall be loved of my father and i will
[1:21:39] love him
[1:21:40] and will manifest myself to him
[1:21:45] judah said unto him not iscariot lord
[1:21:48] how is it that thou wilt manifest thou
[1:21:51] self thyself unto us
[1:21:52] and not unto the world and jesus said
[1:21:55] unto him
[1:21:56] if a man loves me he will keep
[1:21:59] my words and my father will
[1:22:02] love him and he will come unto him
[1:22:05] and make we will come unto him and make
[1:22:08] our abode with him
[1:22:12] that's very key because the holy spirit
[1:22:16] the real the new birth is not a moving
[1:22:19] on
[1:22:20] and a leaving way not a moving on
[1:22:23] and leaving away but he comes to abide
[1:22:27] he comes to abide in a place that
[1:22:30] welcomes him
[1:22:31] for who he is so this is why he cannot
[1:22:34] come by the way
[1:22:35] of the new birth where the word is not
[1:22:37] preached
[1:22:39] are you hearing me it takes that of the
[1:22:42] word
[1:22:42] that actually it reveals his
[1:22:45] characteristics
[1:22:46] to be the same it's the word has god is
[1:22:49] ministering that word
[1:22:50] he's working on our life he don't even
[1:22:52] ask you and how to figure it out
[1:22:54] god just asked you and i to believe it
[1:22:56] god don't even ask you to look at your
[1:22:58] life and say
[1:22:59] i can't say a man to there uh you know
[1:23:01] boy i still got this on my life say amen
[1:23:03] to the word
[1:23:04] if it's the word you're not saying amen
[1:23:06] to yourself you're saying amen to the
[1:23:08] word
[1:23:08] amen means so be it
[1:23:12] hallelujah you stand there upon that
[1:23:15] word
[1:23:15] when it's coming forth what are you
[1:23:16] doing you're keeping which means to
[1:23:19] attend
[1:23:20] carefully to what he is speaking
[1:23:23] to your heart it invites him
[1:23:27] you attend to it carefully be it unto me
[1:23:29] according to that word
[1:23:31] you give yourself to that word as the
[1:23:33] word is coming forth
[1:23:34] don't try to figure it out don't even
[1:23:36] try to set steps for yourself
[1:23:38] three ways to be a better me god don't
[1:23:40] want you doing that
[1:23:42] he wants us just to accept his word to
[1:23:45] attend to it carefully
[1:23:46] how do i tend to the word carefully give
[1:23:49] your heart to the word
[1:23:51] and let god come and perform his word
[1:23:54] that goes for
[1:23:55] everybody that's in here just
[1:23:58] attend to the word just say amen to the
[1:24:00] word
[1:24:01] you say so be it to the word listen
[1:24:03] we're not hearing a pep rally
[1:24:05] we're here as sons and daughters of god
[1:24:08] amen we are hearing a word
[1:24:11] from our homeland
[1:24:14] this message is sounding on earth what
[1:24:16] was echoed in heaven
[1:24:18] there's a people on earth that are
[1:24:20] inclined with
[1:24:21] god just as the messenger was
[1:24:24] [Music]
[1:24:26] there's a people on earth where the word
[1:24:29] has been born into existence
[1:24:32] in their life
[1:24:36] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:24:39] it's a word that heaven stands behind
[1:24:44] hallelujah hold that little policeman
[1:24:47] brother ram said he stands out in the
[1:24:49] middle of the street he puts up his hand
[1:24:50] he said he don't have enough power to
[1:24:52] stop a runaway pony but it ain't his
[1:24:54] strength
[1:24:56] he's got an authority that badger
[1:24:59] believer
[1:25:01] that badger believer says when i stand
[1:25:04] out there
[1:25:04] and the hand is thrown up they've got to
[1:25:07] stop
[1:25:07] it's not stopping because of who we are
[1:25:10] is stopping because of who we represent
[1:25:15] [Applause]
[1:25:18] hallelujah
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:22] glory be to god take that devil
[1:25:26] [Applause]
[1:25:29] that's the truth friends we're making no
[1:25:32] peace treaty and no pacts with the devil
[1:25:36] if he's tried to come on your land this
[1:25:38] morning you serve him an eviction
[1:25:40] notice get out of here in the name of
[1:25:43] jesus christ
[1:25:44] hallelujah you say what do i do you
[1:25:47] start moving by way of the word
[1:25:48] god will show you that ox gold
[1:25:52] come on somebody you start moving
[1:25:54] getting into that of the current of the
[1:25:56] word
[1:25:56] god will show you just what you need and
[1:25:58] it won't be you doing it
[1:26:00] it'll be him that is inspiring you and
[1:26:03] energizing you you understand what i'm
[1:26:05] saying i'm not asking if you feel worthy
[1:26:08] or not
[1:26:08] i'm speaking of him who is the worthy
[1:26:11] one
[1:26:11] and he's letting you know who you are
[1:26:15] that's why the spirit of god could move
[1:26:17] down through the prophet and say
[1:26:19] satan has tried to tell you that you're
[1:26:21] some trodden
[1:26:22] down good for nothing group of people
[1:26:25] but you are the sons
[1:26:26] and daughters of the living gods
[1:26:35] he that hallelujah me not keepeth not my
[1:26:38] sins
[1:26:39] just disregards them and the word
[1:26:43] which you hear is not mine
[1:26:46] but the fathers which sent me
[1:26:50] now you see it's a blessing
[1:26:54] when we hear as jesus said you keep my
[1:26:57] commandments
[1:26:59] these are the sayings of god as he said
[1:27:02] here right there at the last part if he
[1:27:04] keepeth not my sayings
[1:27:06] jesus never come to add new commandments
[1:27:10] even though he could say a new
[1:27:12] commandment i give unto you
[1:27:14] because you see now the one who gave
[1:27:18] the law the one who had who is the word
[1:27:21] himself
[1:27:22] now that could be declared in that hour
[1:27:26] that you love one another even as i've
[1:27:28] loved you
[1:27:29] that would that would not be possible
[1:27:31] without the coming
[1:27:33] of the holy ghost so you see the word
[1:27:36] that is declared in that hour there's no
[1:27:39] way that that word
[1:27:40] can come to pass even in the hearts and
[1:27:42] lives of the people
[1:27:44] without the holy ghost coming down to
[1:27:47] quicken that word
[1:27:48] and to bring it to pass so if god is
[1:27:50] speaking
[1:27:51] are you hearing me then the god who is
[1:27:53] speaking is there
[1:27:54] to fulfill it
[1:27:58] amen and this is where we look in the
[1:28:01] scriptures there's a blessing
[1:28:03] in the commandments of god there's a
[1:28:06] blessing with keeping the word so
[1:28:08] as a children of god and sons and
[1:28:10] daughters of god we truly couldn't be
[1:28:12] sons and daughters of god
[1:28:13] if we don't if we don't value the word
[1:28:17] you see the bible gives forth whoever
[1:28:19] adds to the word
[1:28:21] or takes from it his part will be taken
[1:28:23] out of the book of life
[1:28:25] so god god won't stand for any additives
[1:28:27] nor will he stand for for any deductions
[1:28:31] it's got to be the full word that's why
[1:28:34] the spirit of truth has come notice
[1:28:35] in revelations 22 14 blessed are they
[1:28:38] that do his commandments
[1:28:40] that they may have right to the tree of
[1:28:42] life
[1:28:43] and may enter in through the gates into
[1:28:46] that city
[1:28:47] now the bible goes on and tells us let
[1:28:49] me go back to the beginning in
[1:28:50] revelation
[1:28:51] revelations 1 verse 1 the revelation of
[1:28:54] jesus christ
[1:28:55] which god gave unto him to show unto his
[1:28:59] servants things
[1:29:00] which must shortly come to pass he sent
[1:29:02] and signified it
[1:29:04] by his angel unto his servant john
[1:29:07] who bear record of the word of god and
[1:29:10] of the testimony of jesus christ
[1:29:12] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[1:29:14] he that
[1:29:15] read it and they that hear the words of
[1:29:17] this prophecy
[1:29:18] and keep those things which are written
[1:29:20] therein for the time
[1:29:22] is at hand so that revelation
[1:29:25] of jesus christ it is given personally
[1:29:28] between god and the believer
[1:29:31] god will sound forth as it says here
[1:29:34] also
[1:29:35] in revelations 22 i jesus has sent my
[1:29:38] angel into the churches to testify of
[1:29:41] these things
[1:29:42] it's the same holy ghost the same jesus
[1:29:45] that has testified
[1:29:46] of his word down through the ages
[1:29:50] is that right but now in this time in
[1:29:53] this hour
[1:29:53] he comes in his fullness because now
[1:29:56] once again
[1:29:57] there is a bride that a bride now
[1:30:00] standing
[1:30:01] and coming into a full maturity back
[1:30:04] as it was there on the day of pentecost
[1:30:07] so now the alpha has become the omega
[1:30:11] this is why in that part of the
[1:30:13] scripture let us be glad and rejoice
[1:30:15] for the marriage of the lamb has come it
[1:30:18] had not come
[1:30:19] before that but now here comes the
[1:30:22] announcement
[1:30:22] on earth see it was a written word
[1:30:26] but now the time is at hand and the word
[1:30:29] sounds forth it's not a preacher quoting
[1:30:33] a scripture
[1:30:34] it's god standing there god with skin
[1:30:37] on it's god sounding out the word it's
[1:30:40] god speaking to our hearts
[1:30:41] let us be glad and rejoice
[1:30:45] for the marriage of the lamb
[1:30:48] has come
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:52] and his wife she had
[1:30:55] made herself ready how
[1:30:59] she took what he said and she attended
[1:31:02] to it carefully
[1:31:05] she gave herself she gives herself to
[1:31:07] this word
[1:31:08] she is dressed in the garments of the
[1:31:14] word you do not look upon the bride and
[1:31:17] say
[1:31:18] oh you must be baptist nope
[1:31:21] she doesn't have that name that speaks
[1:31:24] of adultery
[1:31:25] oh you must be pentecostal no not by
[1:31:28] denomination
[1:31:29] but as far as experience yes
[1:31:32] are you hearing me you see she comes
[1:31:34] back to reveal
[1:31:35] or to manifest that name listen friends
[1:31:38] i don't say those things lightly or to
[1:31:39] look down
[1:31:40] there are people out in there not being
[1:31:41] part of the bride unless unless they
[1:31:43] come in
[1:31:44] through a bright message but there will
[1:31:46] be lives who will be saved but they will
[1:31:47] not be part of the rapture
[1:31:49] the rapture is for the elect of god and
[1:31:52] the word of god the love of god
[1:31:53] sounds to their heart to call them to
[1:31:55] this degree think of it
[1:31:57] that you think how how long or how far
[1:31:59] would i get by preaching a gospel like
[1:32:01] this
[1:32:01] if i went down the road to one of these
[1:32:03] churches i could have opened up with
[1:32:05] them maybe the first few minutes and
[1:32:06] they'd have kicked me out
[1:32:09] is that right i don't care you can go
[1:32:11] down through many of the churches they
[1:32:13] would have went right ahead and put me
[1:32:14] out
[1:32:14] not because that i'm here again arrogant
[1:32:16] or but it's the word of god
[1:32:18] what the word is calling our lives to
[1:32:20] it's the word that sounds out to our
[1:32:22] lives it doesn't listen
[1:32:24] we don't look down on anybody else if it
[1:32:26] doesn't mean anything to them that's
[1:32:28] fine
[1:32:29] go on you can't be anything that god has
[1:32:31] made you but if there's a call in your
[1:32:33] heart
[1:32:34] to go across jordan there's a longing in
[1:32:36] your heart
[1:32:37] brother there is a deed that calls to
[1:32:39] the deep there is a word
[1:32:40] there is a god on the scene who's there
[1:32:43] to meet
[1:32:44] and minister to that need and release to
[1:32:47] you and i what we have need of
[1:32:50] the time is at hand so that word
[1:32:53] the word can only be revealed in its
[1:32:56] season
[1:32:58] oh my let me read these scriptures here
[1:32:59] to you in psalms 103 verse 20
[1:33:02] ah hallelujah bless the lord it's
[1:33:05] speaking of the value
[1:33:07] of heeding to his word bless the lord ye
[1:33:10] his
[1:33:10] angels speaking of
[1:33:14] ministers his messengers that excel in
[1:33:17] strength

[1:33:21] the voice
[1:33:22] of his word psalms 112 verse 1
[1:33:27] praise ye the lord blessed is the man
[1:33:30] that feareth the lord that delighteth
[1:33:33] greatly
[1:33:34] in his commandments notice feareth the
[1:33:37] lord
[1:33:39] in reality that's departed from this
[1:33:41] earth
[1:33:48] and i ask you to be very to think very
[1:33:50] deeply even among religious people
[1:33:55] the fear of the lord
[1:33:58] the spirit of god wrote about this in
[1:34:01] timothy
[1:34:02] through paul that was an in-kind
[1:34:03] end-time condition
[1:34:05] judes wrote about it too they think
[1:34:08] nothing to speak
[1:34:09] evil of dignitaries are you with me
[1:34:13] you see because you you tear down one
[1:34:15] person in authority you tear down
[1:34:18] everybody
[1:34:20] are you hearing me if you speak against
[1:34:22] any this is the word of god
[1:34:25] this is why even when you take those who
[1:34:27] were in the days
[1:34:28] of elisha and elisha even though when he
[1:34:31] called those she bears out that wasn't
[1:34:32] the spirit of god
[1:34:33] that was an angry prophet but what i
[1:34:35] want to deal with here and just to think
[1:34:37] as it comes to my heart
[1:34:38] remember those those boys they came out
[1:34:40] there those children
[1:34:41] and said old ball head are you going to
[1:34:43] go up there like elijah
[1:34:45] where did they hear such talking like
[1:34:47] that in their homes
[1:34:50] you see your children learn to fear god
[1:34:52] according to how you fear god
[1:34:54] if you don't fear god they won't fear
[1:34:56] god at all either
[1:34:58] if you don't respect authority they
[1:35:00] won't respect authority either
[1:35:01] you see it's how you train them and you
[1:35:03] teach them it's how oh my i don't know
[1:35:05] how we got on this can of worms
[1:35:07] but you see it's it's something that all
[1:35:09] of a sudden we wonder
[1:35:10] how did it get in the situation it is
[1:35:13] but this
[1:35:13] is the blessing if we fear the lord
[1:35:16] reverence him
[1:35:17] it in that we have to understand it even
[1:35:19] sometimes when we look at him and say oh
[1:35:22] that's hard but yet within our heart we
[1:35:24] say lord
[1:35:25] that's your word i want to line up with
[1:35:27] that lord
[1:35:28] blessed is the man that feareth the lord
[1:35:31] that delighteth greatly in his
[1:35:33] commandments i love this
[1:35:35] his seed shall be mighty upon earth
[1:35:38] the generation of the upright shall be
[1:35:42] blessed well we can preach that of the
[1:35:45] lord jesus christ and sons and daughters
[1:35:47] of god
[1:35:48] the seed being mighty aren't you glad
[1:35:50] for a word that's come forth in this
[1:35:51] hour
[1:35:52] aren't you thankful think about it now
[1:35:54] look at this when abraham
[1:35:56] he met melchizedek when levi is is
[1:35:59] recorded
[1:35:59] as though levi paid ties unto
[1:36:02] melchizedek
[1:36:03] you see he was there in the loins of
[1:36:05] abraham
[1:36:06] when it came time for his time he
[1:36:08] manifested in that hour
[1:36:10] the same way that his father did because
[1:36:12] he was there
[1:36:13] he was represented of how that a son of
[1:36:16] abraham
[1:36:17] would respond when the word come forth
[1:36:20] glory be to god
[1:36:21] and listen brother sister we were in the
[1:36:24] loins of god's mind
[1:36:26] when god became flesh we were
[1:36:28] transferred down to the loins
[1:36:30] of jesus we went to calvary with him
[1:36:34] we died with him and we got up on that
[1:36:37] easter morning
[1:36:38] when he got up there is an authority
[1:36:40] that reigns out in our life
[1:36:42] oh because one that stood faithful there
[1:36:45] is one
[1:36:46] who stood on our behalf now that same
[1:36:49] life
[1:36:50] is released back into you and i who fear
[1:36:52] the lord
[1:36:53] delight greatly in his commandments and
[1:36:55] it is his strength
[1:36:57] his strength mighty is his seed
[1:37:00] in the earth
[1:37:10] it's his life it's a token it's his life
[1:37:13] that comes to you and i
[1:37:15] it's what's ministered to you and i the
[1:37:17] life
[1:37:18] of what sin of what satan
[1:37:22] had deceived taken there
[1:37:25] in the beginning adam walked out
[1:37:29] willfully in disobedience to
[1:37:32] save his wife i hear god comes back
[1:37:36] and god provides you and i
[1:37:39] with a with a true token
[1:37:43] by his divine love now let me read this
[1:37:47] to you here
[1:37:48] just really tune in here he says the
[1:37:51] token is the sign
[1:37:53] that the purchase has been made and it's
[1:37:56] been accepted
[1:37:57] you can't get the token from the
[1:37:59] railroad fair
[1:38:01] until you pay the price the only way
[1:38:04] you're going to pay the price
[1:38:07] is pay it he says
[1:38:10] what believe it
[1:38:14] accept it full obedience to the whole
[1:38:17] word of god
[1:38:18] will entitle you to the token
[1:38:22] amen what do i do first believe it

[1:38:37] hallelujah full obedience to the whole
[1:38:40] word of god
[1:38:42] will entitle you to the token full
[1:38:44] obedience
[1:38:45] not the part of it as far as your
[1:38:47] denomination goes
[1:38:49] but all full obedience to the word
[1:38:52] which is christ brings you into christ
[1:38:57] now what if you was just all in but your
[1:38:59] feet hanging out
[1:39:01] one of you was all in with your hands
[1:39:03] hanging out
[1:39:04] most all of us in but the heart hanging
[1:39:08] out
[1:39:08] the hearts in the world yet but we don't
[1:39:11] want to do that
[1:39:13] full complete obedience puts you
[1:39:16] and the word one you believe it every
[1:39:20] bit of it
[1:39:20] and all of it's in you and you watch it
[1:39:23] working
[1:39:24] through you now
[1:39:28] maybe there you know we can't relate as
[1:39:30] far as train fare
[1:39:31] maybe some of you have rode a train but
[1:39:34] you know how it is you ride
[1:39:36] in an automobile or a plane
[1:39:40] or a bus you can't just go on that bus
[1:39:42] and say
[1:39:44] here here's here's my 500
[1:39:48] now let me on this airplane
[1:39:52] you wouldn't even get you would not
[1:39:54] nowadays
[1:39:55] you won't even get through security
[1:39:59] you won't even be able to check your
[1:40:00] bags through to get to any place in that
[1:40:04] airport
[1:40:04] you've got to have your ticket and
[1:40:06] you've got to have your identification
[1:40:09] are you with me certain countries you go
[1:40:12] to they'll ask you for it a whole lot
[1:40:14] more
[1:40:15] yeah china i was afraid they were going
[1:40:17] to rub my picture off
[1:40:22] you can't get anywhere without it but
[1:40:25] you can't get on the plane or the train
[1:40:27] without it but you there is a way
[1:40:30] to purchase that fare
[1:40:34] is that right now let me ask you
[1:40:35] something when you go to purchase a
[1:40:37] plane ticket
[1:40:37] you know how it is when you go places
[1:40:39] sometimes you especially if you know
[1:40:40] you're going somewhere ahead of time
[1:40:42] i i like i like to know far ahead as i
[1:40:44] can plan
[1:40:45] because why you get a better price on
[1:40:47] the ticket is that right so
[1:40:50] it's the same way with a train or
[1:40:51] whatever more but you see there have
[1:40:53] been some times
[1:40:54] where all of a sudden you know i got a
[1:40:56] call and maybe it's only a month away a
[1:40:58] month and a half and
[1:40:59] and i had that maybe that that part was
[1:41:01] open on that month i had nowhere there
[1:41:03] was nowhere else
[1:41:04] i was to go and i look there and i think
[1:41:06] oh my goodness
[1:41:07] here this plane ticket this plane ticket
[1:41:09] for me to fly to
[1:41:11] to wherever this plane ticket's going to
[1:41:12] cost me 500 some dollars
[1:41:14] maybe 700 to fly from here to there or
[1:41:17] whatever more i'm talking places that i
[1:41:18] there ain't no way i'm going to drive
[1:41:20] you understand so when you look at you
[1:41:23] say well
[1:41:24] why why would that even be purchased
[1:41:26] within that way
[1:41:27] you see it's whether or not you value it
[1:41:30] there's a part of it that you could look
[1:41:32] at and say ain't no way in the world
[1:41:34] i'll just take mountain dew and i'll
[1:41:35] drive two days straight
[1:41:38] well i'm trying to be i'm trying to be
[1:41:40] some account when i get there
[1:41:42] are you with me what i'm telling you is
[1:41:44] it depends on what you value
[1:41:47] you can't when you purchase that ticket
[1:41:49] and the money you put down
[1:41:50] you're saying i value this to go ahead
[1:41:53] and to purchase that ticket and once you
[1:41:55] got the ticket
[1:41:56] hey it's good you're going to make that
[1:41:58] flight you got to be there on time
[1:42:00] you're there and they'll send you
[1:42:02] updates they let you know
[1:42:03] signs are creeping up on us they give
[1:42:06] you little updates let you know
[1:42:08] so much until you need to be at the gate
[1:42:10] departure is this amount of time
[1:42:12] they're letting you know because why
[1:42:14] you've already purchased the ticket
[1:42:17] you're getting updates that it's getting
[1:42:19] time
[1:42:20] for departure they start asking you a
[1:42:23] question
[1:42:24] do you want to go ahead and get your
[1:42:25] baggage checked in
[1:42:29] is that right they'll begin to ask you
[1:42:31] those questions why
[1:42:32] because the fair has already been paid
[1:42:36] and you have the token the token we're
[1:42:38] talking about
[1:42:39] is the baptism of the holy ghost what is
[1:42:42] the fair that's required
[1:42:44] faith faith to simply believe it
[1:42:48] and accept it and yield to that
[1:42:51] brother that's the purchasing power
[1:42:56] my this is why when the scriptures
[1:42:59] had the scriptures there what it would
[1:43:01] express here let me just move ahead
[1:43:03] to think of how that the bible would
[1:43:05] talk about that there were those
[1:43:07] there in the book of acts and they would
[1:43:09] speak of how that when they
[1:43:11] the word would come to them in acts 17
[1:43:14] 11 they were more noble than those in
[1:43:16] thessalonica
[1:43:17] they received the word with all
[1:43:19] readiness of mind
[1:43:20] and searched the scriptures daily
[1:43:22] whether those things were so
[1:43:24] therefore many of them believed also
[1:43:26] honorable women which were greeks and a
[1:43:28] men
[1:43:28] not a few first thessalonians 2 verse 13
[1:43:32] for this cause also think we god without
[1:43:35] ceasing
[1:43:36] because when ye received the word of god
[1:43:38] which you heard of us
[1:43:40] you received it not as the word of men
[1:43:43] but as it is in truth the word of god
[1:43:45] which effectually worketh also
[1:43:48] in you that believe
[1:43:51] hallelujah not as a word of man but as a
[1:43:54] word of almighty god
[1:43:56] you see this what is happening it's the
[1:43:58] spirit of god
[1:43:59] that begins to move into that word and
[1:44:01] what's he doing
[1:44:02] brother sister do you realize it goes
[1:44:04] many times it'll bypass
[1:44:06] our mind begins to look at that and say
[1:44:08] you know that ain't nothing but the
[1:44:09] truth
[1:44:10] and here it don't matter what kind of a
[1:44:11] condition that you are setting in
[1:44:13] when the word begin to speak and god
[1:44:16] begins to turn your heart
[1:44:17] there's a part there and that mind says
[1:44:19] this is absolutely the truth
[1:44:21] what's he doing it's beginning to line
[1:44:24] up with that word
[1:44:25] and you're beginning to recognize this
[1:44:27] is not the word of a man
[1:44:29] a word of a man cannot answer the
[1:44:31] questions on my heart
[1:44:33] it cannot speak to the depth in my life
[1:44:36] this man don't even know me
[1:44:37] but you begin to recognize it's god and
[1:44:40] it moves
[1:44:41] in a manner of a love affair and you're
[1:44:43] receiving that word
[1:44:45] into your life what's happening you
[1:44:46] allow that word when you receive it
[1:44:48] as the truth you accept it you believe
[1:44:51] it what does it do
[1:44:52] it effectually works in your life
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:44:58] you begin to agree with the word
[1:45:02] as you agree with the word it invites
[1:45:05] the word to come
[1:45:11] oh glory
[1:45:15] look at this scripture i want to just
[1:45:16] just just closing out
[1:45:19] on this part of it what i just read to
[1:45:22] you brother brown makes that same
[1:45:23] statement
[1:45:26] and each of the token message is full
[1:45:28] obedience
[1:45:30] full obedience to the word of god
[1:45:32] entitles you to the token
[1:45:36] in acts 5 32
[1:45:40] peter and the rest
[1:45:45] speaking here the word we are his
[1:45:49] witnesses of these things
[1:45:51] and so also is the holy ghost whom god
[1:45:55] hath given to them that
[1:45:58] obey him
[1:46:03] this word obey it means to submit
[1:46:07] and to yield to
[1:46:10] take a life that could sit right here
[1:46:13] and god deals with that life
[1:46:15] and they could look in their life and
[1:46:17] there may be all sorts of things
[1:46:19] in their house in their home it might
[1:46:21] have been all sorts of things they'd
[1:46:23] done before
[1:46:23] even coming here let's say oh my
[1:46:28] you mean i got to go out of here man i
[1:46:30] got to go out here and i got to do this
[1:46:32] and i got to do that
[1:46:33] and i got to do that lord i want
[1:46:36] i want your life more than anything what
[1:46:39] god's looking for is full obedience
[1:46:41] because you see a person can let's say
[1:46:43] if it's supposed to get rid of this
[1:46:46] a person can do that
[1:46:49] but if they don't do it from here amen
[1:46:51] it'll come right back
[1:46:53] if they don't do it because of him
[1:46:57] and they're falling in love with him
[1:46:58] it'll come right back
[1:47:01] but full obedience is where the spirit
[1:47:03] of god can move into a life
[1:47:05] oh my it might have been a life that oh
[1:47:08] my
[1:47:08] it could be so many different things
[1:47:10] about it
[1:47:12] but in a moment's time the spirit of god
[1:47:15] can so move down in that light
[1:47:18] not only not only have they opened their
[1:47:21] heart to receive him
[1:47:23] as their lord their savior how he'll
[1:47:25] move right in
[1:47:26] clean their life up and he'll set right
[1:47:29] down
[1:47:30] in their life why
[1:47:33] full obedience to the word by the time
[1:47:36] you mean that can happen
[1:47:37] even before a person is baptized in the
[1:47:40] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:47:41] well i'm preaching that name but
[1:47:43] remember in the book of acts
[1:47:44] when they heard the word preached the
[1:47:46] holy ghost fell
[1:47:48] is that right and then they rose up and
[1:47:50] were baptized in the name of the lord
[1:47:52] jesus christ
[1:47:54] what we're talking about is full
[1:47:55] obedience is where the heart
[1:47:58] is moved by god into that place
[1:48:04] and god does that song amen
[1:48:08] think about saul here with saul
[1:48:14] he had it right here with samuel samuel
[1:48:17] gave him
[1:48:18] the word to go into battle and to defeat
[1:48:22] the amalekites now the amalekites
[1:48:25] themselves
[1:48:26] remember what they represent they
[1:48:29] represent that of
[1:48:30] the flesh it will be something which god
[1:48:33] will take that battle up
[1:48:34] in every generation god comes forward to
[1:48:38] meet the challenge
[1:48:39] of amalek our first nature in every
[1:48:42] generation
[1:48:44] and here god comes to saul and he tells
[1:48:47] saul
[1:48:49] don't keep nothing he said i want you to
[1:48:52] get rid of
[1:48:53] every one of the sheep oxen and
[1:48:55] everything else and i want you to get
[1:48:56] rid of the king
[1:48:58] i want you i don't want you to leave one
[1:48:59] of them alive you see in every
[1:49:01] generation you'll look at this in the
[1:49:03] scripture
[1:49:04] you find that how that in every
[1:49:05] generation it would say
[1:49:07] well david wiped out the amalekites or
[1:49:09] david you know
[1:49:10] how that he stood against them you'll
[1:49:12] find down through the ages then you look
[1:49:13] and say well
[1:49:14] my here they are standing against the
[1:49:16] amalekites at that time that was a type
[1:49:18] of how that god would bring a word and
[1:49:21] that word would deal with the amalekites
[1:49:23] in that generation but um but until the
[1:49:26] fullness or the time
[1:49:27] of full redemption to where eventually
[1:49:29] it's completely done away with god comes
[1:49:31] to deal with it
[1:49:32] now here god gives saul the word he
[1:49:35] tells saul
[1:49:36] saul go take care of all of it
[1:49:39] but saul goes up there and he starts
[1:49:42] feeling sorry
[1:49:44] he feels sorry for different ones and
[1:49:46] you know the people this one
[1:49:48] saul this is this would be a good
[1:49:50] offering to god
[1:49:51] this would be so wonderful saul saul you
[1:49:54] should
[1:49:54] we should keep this and everything is
[1:49:57] just working in a manner
[1:49:58] that ain't real love that ain't love at
[1:50:02] all
[1:50:03] but the real love of god is to keep his
[1:50:06] word
[1:50:07] even when it goes against the grain of
[1:50:10] our flesh
[1:50:13] but here saul comes back into the camp
[1:50:16] and samuel says
[1:50:17] what is that bleeding i
[1:50:21] what is that that i hear there were
[1:50:23] things that he brought with him
[1:50:26] back from amalek that he should never
[1:50:29] have brought
[1:50:31] and he wanted to bring that in and he
[1:50:33] said i've obeyed the word of the lord
[1:50:36] but he didn't obey it he obeyed what he
[1:50:39] thought was enough
[1:50:42] or what was the word of the lord
[1:50:46] but it wasn't the word of the lord
[1:50:49] think of what took place god
[1:50:52] told him you've rejected the word
[1:50:55] and because of that the kingdom was rent
[1:51:00] from his life given to david
[1:51:04] i'd say it in this manner when the
[1:51:06] spirit of god

[1:53:35] according to thy word what was it
[1:53:38] god had given inspired word
[1:53:41] to elijah elijah was a channel
[1:53:45] that was designated to god and elijah
[1:53:48] could stand there
[1:53:50] he knew what the people had need of they
[1:53:52] had need
[1:53:53] just to see the same living god
[1:53:56] the same one that had come down and
[1:53:59] moved in the beginning

[1:54:02] egypt the same god that had parted the
[1:54:04] waters the same god
[1:54:06] who part of the jordan the same god who
[1:54:08] took down the walls of jericho

[1:54:15] when elijah prays he said oh
[1:54:18] lord god of abraham
[1:54:22] isaac not jacob israel

[1:54:29] with the condemnation there was a word
[1:54:32] that could deal with the sin and where
[1:54:35] they were at there was a word in that
[1:54:37] time
[1:54:37] that could deal with it and he said let
[1:54:39] it be known
[1:54:40] that i'm your servant and that these are
[1:54:44] thy people o god
[1:54:45] and that thou hast turn their heart

[1:55:25] right
[1:55:26] you get every one of them and you bring
