[22:07] Jesus I've got a very very brief
[22:09] testimony this morning uh it's
[22:12] a good testimony on my son who had a car
[22:15] accident 13 months ago it was a near
[22:18] fatal accident but uh he survived with
[22:22] only Orthopedic injuries nothing uh
[22:26] life-threatening such as brain head neck
[22:28] spine
[22:29] and that sort of thing uh which we are
[22:32] still 13 months later thankful
[22:36] for uh as I was putting this together
[22:38] last night I was thinking
[22:41] um I really didn't want to have to admit
[22:44] this but um Ben is still suffering from
[22:49] PTSD he has been uh manifesting a number
[22:53] of
[22:54] Behavioral cues that uh Point firmly in
[22:57] this direction
[22:59] I've seen it all along in 13 months but
[23:01] I've just kind of pretended it wasn't
[23:04] there hoping that you know that was not
[23:06] the case because um you know PTSD is a
[23:10] very uh it's very complicated uh it's
[23:14] very complicated situation you know like
[23:16] uh my wife is suffering from PTSD also
[23:20] but you know in PTSD there's not just
[23:23] the initial
[23:25] trauma that that's that's injurious to
[23:28] to the mind but it's all the things that
[23:32] come after it like in my son's son's
[23:35] case you know the trauma starts when he
[23:38] wakes up at the crash site and he's in
[23:40] the most unimaginable pain possible well
[23:44] that puts the stake down for
[23:46] PTSD and all of the pain uh you know for
[23:50] much of the 13 months he's been in n91
[23:53] level pain uh all of what comes after
[23:55] that with pain and disappointment etc
[23:57] etc it just kinds it kind of um
[24:02] continued to give life to the to the
[24:05] PTSD and so uh that is a cause of
[24:08] concern for me but um he has been seeing
[24:12] a counselor who's uh agreed to see him
[24:15] uh at a virtual visit and uh you know
[24:18] we're so U we're so thankful so thankful
[24:21] for that and uh you know also my wife uh
[24:24] you know there was
[24:26] the initial shock of hearing about the
[24:29] accident and then
[24:31] um you know when you're walking down the
[24:33] hall at the clinic in the trauma unit
[24:36] you can see him at the end of the hall
[24:37] and that's your son you know that's man
[24:40] that's some tough uh that's some tough
[24:43] stuff and um but uh you know for her and
[24:47] and I don't understand this because I'm
[24:49] not a
[24:50] mother um I wish I did maybe I could be
[24:54] of a more more of a of help
[24:58] but you know she has to watch her child
[25:00] be in constant pain she has to watch her
[25:03] child in pain through Physical Therapy
[25:07] uh just you know I don't you get it I
[25:10] mean I don't need to go on and on you
[25:12] get it and she's she's a witness to all
[25:15] that and you know even though I
[25:17] experience the same thing I'm not a
[25:20] mother and uh it's something that's
[25:22] that's really left its uh left its mark
[25:25] on her as I was thinking about this last
[25:29] night uh go ahead and put that quote up
[25:32] I I came across something that Charles
[25:34] uh Spurgeon said that really blessed my
[25:38] heart and gave me uh comfort as to uh
[25:41] the fact that the Lord knows
[25:44] everything dear Spurgeon said few will
[25:48] associate with the
[25:50] depressed but Jehovah chooses their
[25:53] company and stays until he has healed
[25:57] them with his
[25:59] Comfort he wants to handle and heal the
[26:03] brokenhearted he applies the ointment of
[26:06] grace and the soft bandages of love he
[26:10] binds the bleeding wounds of those that
[26:13] are convicted of sin this is Godly
[26:19] compassion
[26:21] Glory it really blesses me about this
[26:24] quote this not this is not some Namby
[26:27] pambi incubator chicken like we got
[26:30] today this is a man
[26:33] who's whose life with Christ was forged
[26:37] in a very in the iron furnace he had
[26:41] many things that he suffered but uh
[26:45] through all of that ironically there was
[26:49] joy and only a Christian can understand
[26:53] that that you can be ever in ever so
[26:58] much pain physically mentally
[27:01] otherwise but joy will be the con but
[27:03] joy will be the
[27:05] constant I didn't say happiness I said
[27:09] Joy PA Paul wrote about joy in
[27:12] Philippians when he was in jail Joy is
[27:15] our
[27:16] Birthright and that that just gives me
[27:19] tremendous tremendous Comfort
[27:22] today um Ben was recently signed out of
[27:26] physical therapy since arriving home
[27:28] after since arriving home after being in
[27:31] a nursing home uh back in August he's
[27:34] been doing all of his therapy homework
[27:36] assigned to him by the clinic and he's
[27:39] developed his own exercise regimen
[27:41] exercises that he does on his own which
[27:44] is which is great see that he has that
[27:47] motivation that takes a lot of takes a
[27:49] lot of motivation you know to be in that
[27:51] much pain and to be in the frame of mind
[27:55] that he is but to go ahead and push on
[27:58] you know and push on uh he's also U
[28:02] started studying for his uh computer
[28:05] license exams and uh that's a lot of
[28:08] that's a lot of tough brain work but you
[28:12] know praise God he has the motivation
[28:14] and the the mental strength to be able
[28:16] to do that and uh I've watched him it's
[28:19] uh it's a remarkable thing he can walk
[28:22] on crutches he can walk to and from the
[28:24] car as well as to and from wherever
[28:27] we're going with whether it's doctor's
[28:29] appointments or other appointments he
[28:31] has to go
[28:32] to he can walk
[28:35] upright
[28:37] upright up a flight of stairs GL that
[28:41] can go from the living room to the
[28:43] upstairs all he needs is a
[28:45] spotter but he is doing the rest of it
[28:48] on his own he's not scooting up there on
[28:51] his on his
[28:52] backside there's two rails and he's
[28:55] pulling himself up and it's um
[28:59] man it's it's it's amazing it's so
[29:01] cool uh let's see what else oh yes um
[29:06] and and also you know he's able to do
[29:08] whatever he needs to do that requires
[29:10] his privacy he needs absolutely no help
[29:13] with any of any of
[29:15] that uh last Saturday the three of us
[29:18] Ben My Little Queen and myself we went
[29:21] to Costco for
[29:22] pizza and uh I believe this was the
[29:25] first time he's been out to dinner
[29:29] somewhere yes it was and so you know she
[29:33] drops us off at the at the handicapped
[29:35] Lane and he walks to the he walks

[32:48] profound impact on
[32:51] her

[32:56] changed her and uh she's had she has
[32:59] history with this church especially with

[33:04] been very mindful to ask about her and I
[33:06] relay that to her and uh you know I've
[33:11] known her for over 40 years I know I
[33:14] could tell by the littlest facial
[33:17] expression what she's thinking and it

[33:21] a real it's just really really really
[33:24] touched her and uh you know that's
[33:29] how this wasn't in to say
[33:33] this when we talk about the power of God
[33:36] and the grace of God and the love of God
[33:38] and all those great attributes of
[33:41] God but God uses his church his
[33:46] bride to mediate that power he could
[33:50] just plunk it down like a lightning
[33:53] bolt but he takes
[33:56] individuals he takes their
[34:01] personality he takes their
[34:05] experiences he takes all of what they've
[34:07] been through to develop
[34:10] strength that power goes through that
[34:13] power goes through them with all of what
[34:17] they've been through Into the Heart of
[34:19] who he wants ministered
[34:21] to and it's a beautiful thing it's a
[34:25] beautiful

[46:07] believe amen that certainly is a it's a
[46:11] gift that comes from
[46:12] God and um you know it's something that
[46:16] that's really every that's what it's all
[46:18] based on is to believe amen with every
[46:23] part of every growth and every part of
[46:25] our life it's all based on faith just
[46:30] when God deals with our hearts sometimes
[46:33] just from the New Birth it begins with
[46:35] faith God takes a hold of your life it
[46:38] begins by faith to recognize that what
[46:40] he's already done for me that's faith
[46:43] brother Bram says As We Believe on the
[46:46] Lord Jesus Christ said there's a he said
[46:48] he described it like a gust of wind he
[46:50] said it's it's a lift that comes into
[46:52] your life that begins to lift you above
[46:55] the things of this world then then this
[46:58] faith it continues to build into a place
[47:00] to where then it brings us into that of
[47:04] a real birth with Jesus Christ where his
[47:06] own life is in us and then through every
[47:09] stage of our life everything anything
[47:12] that you or I can look at in our life
[47:14] and say my and look back and say God
[47:18] where you brought me from that started
[47:21] from
[47:22] Faith you the word you heard the word
[47:25] the word was quick into your heart and
[47:27] you surrendered to it and then it built
[47:29] itself in your
[47:32] life ain't that
[47:34] awesome I mean it's to me it's just just
[47:37] overwhelming I've I've been just really
[47:39] to tell you I've just been really
[47:41] meditating and really dwelling in um the
[47:44] message the statue of a perfect man and
[47:46] just seeing how everything in our life
[47:49] it always comes from that of faith
[47:52] everything that God does in our life is
[47:54] just that it's always that Foundation
[47:57] all that he does it's based on us
[48:00] believing I tell you I say God let your
[48:03] let the holy spirit let the penetrating
[48:05] rays of the S so n come in this morning

[48:14] need a lot of words we just need him and
[48:16] when he begins to penetrate as he said
[48:19] let there be light that was a few words

[48:24] what it brought forth right because it
[48:26] was it was his light it was his life and

[51:21] honor and glory in the name of Jesus
[51:24] Christ amen and amen
[51:27] amen amen Ephesians chapter 4 God bless
[51:30] you thank you musicians amen and
[51:35] U I want to just read a few vers of
[51:39] scripture out of Ephesians 4 and we've
[51:41] been uh drawing from this here um and
[51:46] looking at it for a few times on
[51:48] overcoming hindrances and you know I got
[51:51] to looking at the um when as we look at
[51:54] this and um you know I was just really
[51:58] uh in my heart I was telling my wife the
[52:00] other day I said I've wanted to get back
[52:02] into Ruth into certain
[52:04] areas but I said I realized that as I've
[52:07] looking at this you remember one of the
[52:08] last things we spoke on Ruth was from
[52:11] his feet to the throne and so there's a
[52:15] journey but the journey itself to the
[52:17] throne begins in the feet we all have to
[52:20] come to the foot of Calvary and so
[52:22] everything that's in our life it all
[52:25] comes through his feet and so when we
[52:27] look at that and we are know that within
[52:30] it all that it's God who's bringing us
[52:32] along in our journey and so as we're
[52:35] looking at this part of it on overcoming
[52:38] hindrances so uh I want to look here in
[52:41] Ephesians 4 and just read a few vers of
[52:43] scripture beginning with verse 17 if we
[52:46] could start there verse 17 please this I
[52:49] say therefore and testify in the Lord
[52:52] that ye henceforth walk not as other
[52:55] Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
[52:59] mind having the understanding darkened
[53:03] being alienated from the life of God
[53:05] through the ignorance that is in them
[53:08] because of the blindness of their heart
[53:11] who being past feeling have given
[53:14] themselves over unto lasciviousness to
[53:17] work all uncleanliness with greediness
[53:20] but ye have not so learned Christ if so
[53:24] be that ye have heard him have you heard
[53:27] him and been taught by him as the truth
[53:31] is in Jesus so not as the truth is in a
[53:35] man but as the truth is in Jesus he he
[53:39] is the word is that right the word made
[53:42] flesh the very person of God that ye
[53:44] notice that ye put off concerning the
[53:48] former conversation the old man which is
[53:52] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[53:55] and be renewed renewed in the spirit of
[53:57] your mind and that ye put on the new man
[54:02] which after God is created in
[54:06] righteousness and true Holiness so it's
[54:09] it's sinking into
[54:12] him verse 30 and grieve not the holy
[54:16] spirit of God whereby ye are sealed
[54:20] until the day of redemption amen may God
[54:24] bless you and bless the reading of the
[54:25] word as you're being seated
[54:30] uh I want to come back into that point
[54:34] here uh this morning also wanted to say
[54:37] God bless you Sister Kathy it's good to
[54:38] have you here amen and um I know they
[54:42] already welcomed you but it's good to
[54:44] have you here and uh so it's good to
[54:47] have I know different ones as we've
[54:49] checked on different ones and sickness
[54:50] has been through the body and uh you
[54:53] know it's so good and I thought some
[54:54] weeks ago and I am Pour at this and I
[54:58] think you're great I'm thankful for your
[54:59] grace and overlooking I get so I'm I'm
[55:02] this is one PL I'm just focused right
[55:03] here but uh and I know that's where you
[55:06] would want me to be but I'm so glad a
[55:07] few weeks ago and I seen brother brother
[55:09] Dave Crest back here with us and uh the
[55:12] Lord has certainly been merciful there
[55:15] amen and U also with sister Wilma it's
[55:18] so good to to see her and you know it
[55:21] just uh it it has been such a journey
[55:23] and I know Sister wil she was here back
[55:25] in October and she's been here
[55:27] throughout she just had a little bit of
[55:29] it's like the rest of us have dealt with
[55:30] different things of sickness but I'm
[55:32] tell you it's been a journey since where
[55:34] the Lord has brought sister Wilma
[55:36] through but um we're so thankful amen
[55:38] for God's grace so glad for each and
[55:40] every one of you amen we're glad to be
[55:42] here aren't we amen amen so I want to
[55:45] look here at this thought as we begin
[55:48] dealing with the last time we were
[55:50] together on a overcoming hindrances and
[55:53] we've been looking at this and it's
[55:55] things as we look at it it's it's always
[55:59] um that our desire is that it would that
[56:03] Christ himself would be the display
[56:06] through our life and that uh with that
[56:09] you know it's something that it's just
[56:12] it's God who does who is doing the work
[56:14] in our life he's making himself known uh
[56:17] through our lives in many different ways
[56:20] it's um you come back to the the the
[56:23] message that brother Bram preaches
[56:25] before is a key message before the seals
[56:29] on God hiding himself in Simplicity but
[56:32] that's not all the title he hides in
[56:35] Simplicity and then he reveals himself
[56:38] in the same way so when we think of when
[56:42] Revelation when truly Revelation comes
[56:45] to our life which that's what we want we
[56:47] we want revelation let me just say this
[56:50] when Revelation comes and this is why
[56:52] that the prophet said you want to pray
[56:54] for Revelation I'm just going to say
[56:56] this to you that when you begin to pray
[56:59] and seek after God if there is any
[57:03] hindrance in your life the light of God
[57:06] will show that hindrance so that that
[57:09] can be put out of your life that more
[57:11] Revelation can come in you see what I'm
[57:15] saying so it's not about us trying to
[57:17] say I got to get this out of my life I
[57:19] got to get this the reality is we
[57:21] wouldn't even know what it is we need to
[57:23] get out of our life or what is the
[57:25] hindrance but as we're seeking after him
[57:28] God is the one who Reveals All the
[57:32] hindrances or if we come to a place in
[57:34] our life and say I just don't have the
[57:37] joy that I that I had once before uh I I
[57:40] know what God has done in my life but
[57:42] the joy just isn't there as it was
[57:45] before now that doesn't mean that we've
[57:47] gone off or something wrong or maybe
[57:50] even something that we're speaking on
[57:52] here today that there's something wrong
[57:54] like this in our life but I believe as a
[57:55] belie Bel ver there our desire is to
[57:58] live and should be with such a certainty
[58:01] in the coming of the Lord is that I I
[58:03] want to be certain in my walk with God
[58:06] that with my life that it's available to
[58:09] him you know it's kind of like you in
[58:11] the utensils you have in your home you
[58:14] want things to be available and when
[58:15] you're going to eat something you don't
[58:17] want to have to say where are the forks
[58:19] oh they're all in the dishwasher uh
[58:21] that's not going to work you have to you
[58:23] want things to be available and God's
[58:25] desire
[58:26] is that his word and our working in our
[58:29] life that it would be available Brian I
[58:31] need a little bit more brother Brian I
[58:32] didn't hear just a little bit more they
[58:35] God's desire is that that our lives
[58:37] would be available unto him at all times
[58:41] God wants us to live as the prophet said
[58:43] it in one way in a Carefree condition
[58:46] Carefree meaning that where I'm not
[58:48] bogged down bothered and hindered by the
[58:51] problems of life or anything that I see
[58:54] in somebody else that's not that's not
[58:56] my problem I want to live Carefree in
[58:59] the in him I want that I want that Joy
[59:02] the joy of your salvation it's a joy in
[59:05] knowing that you know what I don't know
[59:06] what today holds or what tomorrow holds
[59:08] but I know in whom I have believed and
[59:10] I'm persuaded that he is able sir and
[59:13] the joy of the Lord isn't bubble dancing
[59:15] the joy of the Lord is you know where
[59:17] you're standing even in the midst of
[59:19] trials in the midst that it might be
[59:21] gray skies all around but you've got joy
[59:24] and it's a joy the world didn't give the
[59:26] world can't take it away it's the joy of
[59:29] the Lord that even in the midst of
[59:30] Trials and tests it allows you and gives
[59:33] you strength to conduct yourself as a
[59:35] son and daughter of God that's the real
[59:37] joy of the Lord So within it we we want
[59:40] to just within that you know living in a
[59:43] place that where we are always available
[59:46] to him and so within this I want to just
[59:50] there's a scripture I want to go to and
[59:51] I want to really just focus on there's a
[59:54] difference when we think of pride pride
[59:57] can be something as we were looking at
[1:00:00] here some time ago and I have just a few
[1:00:01] more places on this with pride but Pride
[1:00:04] can come in so subtle in in in our lives
[1:00:09] and we know that within it I want to
[1:00:11] look at the part where there's a real
[1:00:14] difference and in that that you know
[1:00:16] what God himself and I want you to think
[1:00:19] of this God himself has pride in his
[1:00:23] achievements
[1:00:26] right he is God is proud of his
[1:00:30] achievements because it is his desire
[1:00:33] it's out no there's no Mal intent
[1:00:35] there's no there's no wrongful objective
[1:00:39] his desire is to bring his life into you
[1:00:43] and I that as the prophet said it like
[1:00:45] this in the message Oneness God's desire
[1:00:48] was that we would be him amen that's
[1:00:52] God's desire that's his achievement is
[1:00:55] that he would look upon you and I as
[1:00:57] Adam looked on Eve and say she's bone of
[1:01:00] my bone flesh and my flesh she is
[1:01:04] me that's God's achievement you see a
[1:01:07] church a church just just church
[1:01:09] theology can make you look like a church
[1:01:11] or or to where that you know you get to
[1:01:13] talking to somebody long enough oh
[1:01:15] you're Baptist oh you're Pentecostal oh
[1:01:17] you're this God doesn't want us
[1:01:19] identified under a fallen
[1:01:22] name we're to be identified in his his
[1:01:27] name one Lord One Faith one baptism
[1:01:32] there's one name given whereby then we
[1:01:34] must be saved Eve never took she never
[1:01:38] had her own name the Bible said their
[1:01:40] name their name was called Adam but
[1:01:43] after the fall and she received another
[1:01:46] seed that's when she received the name
[1:01:50] Eve is that right mother of all
[1:01:53] living right Adam was not the father of
[1:01:56] all living right so within that God's
[1:02:00] desire is not that our lives would be
[1:02:04] conformed uh into a place to where uh
[1:02:07] it's just something as though it's like
[1:02:10] on the outside but God's desire is that
[1:02:14] our lives would be him so now when I'm
[1:02:17] I'm coming into this the scripture here
[1:02:19] and I want you to look at the scripture
[1:02:21] this is where a scripture just drawing
[1:02:23] from uh in my heart Brandon can you go
[1:02:25] in turn it over for me please uh uh in
[1:02:28] in in in Proverbs 29:23 the Bible says a
[1:02:32] man's Pride now I want you to look at
[1:02:35] that for a moment a man's
[1:02:38] Pride shall bring him
[1:02:41] low now you and I did not have a choice
[1:02:45] when we came to the World by and through
[1:02:49] the sexual birth that we came we come
[1:02:52] under a fallen condition remember the
[1:02:55] fault took place because Satan coming
[1:02:58] through it was him using the vessel of
[1:03:01] the serpent beginning to anoint God's
[1:03:05] daughter to actually begin to want
[1:03:08] something more than what God had given
[1:03:11] her and he's actually anointing her with
[1:03:15] unbelief he's anointing her with
[1:03:19] pride you and I have come into this
[1:03:22] world under that with with here we are
[1:03:26] born in sin the Bible says shaped in
[1:03:28] iniquity come to the world speaking Lies
[1:03:31] We we come and listen even after when
[1:03:35] even God begins to deal with a person's
[1:03:37] heart and life and I can just speak it
[1:03:39] I'm speaking from my own experience
[1:03:41] there's things that automatically where
[1:03:43] fear wants to attack your mind how am I
[1:03:46] going to stand up to my friends how am I
[1:03:48] going to break my associates how am I
[1:03:50] going to lay these things down because
[1:03:52] what we're looking at is our own human
[1:03:55] strength
[1:03:57] but listen the key of it is remember in
[1:04:00] the Book of Revelations where John
[1:04:02] begins to hear the one that is he begins
[1:04:05] to hear the voice of God and the
[1:04:07] scripture says he turned to see the
[1:04:11] voice of him who
[1:04:14] spake he turned to see the one who was
[1:04:16] speaking to him and see that's the very
[1:04:19] thing when God is speaking to our lives
[1:04:22] if we want to hear him and as we hear
[1:04:25] him it's look at him who's speaking to
[1:04:28] you so when we see it that this this
[1:04:32] this Pride a pride a man's Pride not you
[1:04:35] know will bring him low but honor shall
[1:04:38] uphold the humble in heart so when we
[1:04:41] are are seeing this that it's man's a
[1:04:44] man's Pride so there's an element that
[1:04:46] even after God doing a work in our life
[1:04:50] as as God comes into our life he comes
[1:04:52] into your home it's just like look if
[1:04:54] you were to sell your home to somebody
[1:04:56] else they may like your Decor they may
[1:04:59] like what you have and then again you
[1:05:01] know there was homes that I remember my
[1:05:03] wife and I looked at and we could look
[1:05:04] at online and I looked at and said
[1:05:08] that's too much work for me man I mean I
[1:05:11] I don't want to get I I don't want to
[1:05:12] strip no wallpaper I don't I'm sorry you
[1:05:15] might call me lazy or what more I'll
[1:05:16] stay right where I'm at I don't want to
[1:05:18] do none of that I I've seen all that
[1:05:20] from a little boy we're stripping so you
[1:05:22] get what I'm saying so when somebody
[1:05:25] comes into the house or purchase it
[1:05:27] they're going to make that house the way
[1:05:29] they want to make it and when God comes
[1:05:31] into your life through every door of
[1:05:33] your life he is the one that does the
[1:05:36] decorating in your
[1:05:38] life your life becomes uh with pictures
[1:05:42] and portraits of divine grace you can
[1:05:45] see grace of God in Esther's life the
[1:05:48] grace of God in Rebecca's life the grace
[1:05:50] of God in Moses life your whole
[1:05:53] surroundings in your life amen and he
[1:05:56] goes through every room
[1:06:00] am and that one first little room that
[1:06:03] he deals with is
[1:06:06] pride and to think about it that even
[1:06:10] even after the New Birth has
[1:06:14] come God continues to work in our
[1:06:18] life to Deliver Us from
[1:06:23] Pride because as long as we are in these
[1:06:27] bodies in this body and I'm talking
[1:06:30] about with that human Spirit we are
[1:06:32] going to have to continue to battle
[1:06:35] against it but let me just say it it's
[1:06:38] not to be focused as far as on Pride God
[1:06:42] doesn't want you focusing and saying oh
[1:06:44] I must not do this or I must not do that
[1:06:46] the whole key is as we will we live in
[1:06:51] his presence don't allow anything to
[1:06:54] accumulate in our life
[1:06:56] he will take care of all the other
[1:06:59] things amen remember like brother Bram
[1:07:02] tells us about the difference between a
[1:07:04] genuine plant and a hot bed plant he
[1:07:07] said the hot hot bed plants you got to
[1:07:09] keep spraying them and treating them and
[1:07:11] bugs and this and that brother Willie
[1:07:13] you know I'm talking about all the bugs
[1:07:15] oh they got black Mo oh they got this oh
[1:07:17] they got that and you you know you when
[1:07:19] you plant the you got to you got to take
[1:07:21] care of those plants you you have to
[1:07:23] tend to them but you see that's what
[1:07:25] happened happens with hot bed plants but
[1:07:27] a real genuine seed you don't have to
[1:07:30] spray it with all those things I mean
[1:07:33] look at it look at some of the places I
[1:07:35] I'm standing there in Arizona and I'm in
[1:07:37] places and here we are even up in saino
[1:07:39] Canyon and I'm just standing there in
[1:07:41] front of me and I'm looking I'm saying
[1:07:43] how does that cactus grow out of that
[1:07:45] rock those multiple different types of
[1:07:48] cactus how is that growing out of that
[1:07:50] rock I would not think to plant
[1:07:52] something in a rock you want nice soil
[1:07:55] the planet in but you know what nobody
[1:07:57] has to go down through Sabino Canyon and
[1:08:00] spring those things oh we got to watch
[1:08:02] out for this these certain bugs are
[1:08:03] coming along oh what bugs are invading
[1:08:05] now no it there is something within it
[1:08:08] that's built to
[1:08:10] aand is that right and that's the same
[1:08:13] thing that within our lives Amen in the
[1:08:18] presence of God let me tell you
[1:08:20] something you cannot get in the presence
[1:08:22] of God and an and and an and an evil
[1:08:25] thought remain or or some uncleanliness
[1:08:28] or or some spirit that would want to
[1:08:30] hinder in your mind you cannot come in
[1:08:33] the presence of God and it remained
[1:08:35] there it's like the it's like when
[1:08:36] brother Barry gave that example remember
[1:08:38] about those rats that were chewing those
[1:08:40] cords in that plane and that pilot was
[1:08:42] driving that that plane he he all of a
[1:08:45] sudden that pilot realized if I can just
[1:08:47] climb up higher I'm supplied with oxygen
[1:08:50] if I can just climb up higher it'll kill
[1:08:53] the rats in the plane and that's the
[1:08:55] same thing with God it isn't about God
[1:08:58] wanting you and I to say well I'm not
[1:09:00] going to do this and oh I need to worry
[1:09:02] about this it's simply climbing higher
[1:09:04] in him and the things of the world will
[1:09:09] die that's the truth that's why the
[1:09:13] depth of that scripture when it says in
[1:09:15] the book of Isaiah thou will keep him in
[1:09:19] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:09:21] thee Hallelujah so you know a man's
[1:09:26] pride and I want to say that there's an
[1:09:29] element of Pride that we that we would
[1:09:31] have that would be absolutely right you
[1:09:34] might say well how could that be
[1:09:38] well there's things that we should be
[1:09:42] thankful
[1:09:43] for um there's things that when we look
[1:09:46] at and being of a pride and and it's a
[1:09:49] proud like we can be proud of our
[1:09:52] family right there's times not maybe not
[1:09:55] all the time but there's times that that
[1:09:58] we can be uh proud of things that we can
[1:10:01] even see see them do maybe the certain
[1:10:04] steps and certain things there's certain
[1:10:07] elements and listen I'm going to say
[1:10:09] like this let let me just say this God
[1:10:11] doesn't wait till you and I get to the
[1:10:13] other side before he starts pouring
[1:10:15] Praise on
[1:10:16] us are you hearing me that's good God
[1:10:19] himself listen the Bible said the
[1:10:21] heavens
[1:10:22] rejoice when one sinner comes
[1:10:28] home rejoices when one life
[1:10:32] repents God don't say I'm going to
[1:10:33] withhold it I'm going to withhold it
[1:10:35] until until they get sealed God's but
[1:10:37] God begins to pour praise out amen is
[1:10:41] that right because remember you and I
[1:10:43] sometimes friends we don't we're not the
[1:10:45] one who decides and knows who who's
[1:10:48] called to what level and this and that
[1:10:50] we don't know that but notice within it
[1:10:52] all God himself he begins to pour out
[1:10:55] praise he encourages you and I are you
[1:10:59] with me this morning who was it that
[1:11:01] encouraged you in your walk it wasn't
[1:11:03] you it was God that encouraged you it
[1:11:06] was things that begin to move and and
[1:11:09] take place out of your life and my is
[1:11:11] encouraging you and reminding you when
[1:11:14] you got down on yourself and said man I
[1:11:16] I feel like such a failure I don't feel
[1:11:19] no good at all and his grace would sweep
[1:11:22] by and remind you you may not be what
[1:11:25] you want to be or what you ought to be
[1:11:27] but you're not what you used to
[1:11:31] be he knows how to encourage
[1:11:34] us he knows how to even discourage us
[1:11:37] without destroying
[1:11:41] us so you know it's nothing wrong with
[1:11:44] being proud or as far as having some
[1:11:47] pride within things you know when you
[1:11:49] come about come about things but yet
[1:11:52] whenever Pride itself and this is what I
[1:11:54] wants you to think about whenever Pride
[1:11:57] itself moves out from under the
[1:12:00] realization that it is the Lord and his
[1:12:03] gracious working in our lives then
[1:12:06] that's where God begins to withdraw
[1:12:09] himself because God cannot dwell where
[1:12:12] pride
[1:12:14] is he he can't that that kind of Pride
[1:12:17] he can't he can't dwell when that kind
[1:12:19] of Pride begins to be about self
[1:12:22] something that would begin to exalt
[1:12:25] above
[1:12:26] him you know God reminded even would
[1:12:29] remind Israel when they would come into
[1:12:31] the land of everything that they would
[1:12:33] come in the land they never supplied the
[1:12:35] seed they're the one they're they're not
[1:12:37] the ones who planted the things God God
[1:12:40] permitted allowed the Heathen to plant
[1:12:43] those things with Israel in mind let me
[1:12:47] tell you the things that you and I would
[1:12:49] even be enjoyed today God can allow the
[1:12:52] Heathen but God permits it for your use
[1:12:56] come on friends you look at like the
[1:12:58] tape recorder real to real you know a
[1:13:00] lot of people benefited from that record
[1:13:03] players but God allowed that because he
[1:13:06] would record a message in this end time
[1:13:10] God never intended that kind of thing to
[1:13:12] promote rock and roll music and
[1:13:14] everything else God intended it to
[1:13:16] promote the Gospel of Jesus
[1:13:20] Christ is that right Israel when they
[1:13:24] came in the land they're not the ones
[1:13:25] who did that and God warned them in
[1:13:27] Deuteronomy he said Les he said remember
[1:13:31] when you get in the land don't
[1:13:35] forget you get all of this around you
[1:13:38] and you can begin to
[1:13:39] forget where I brought you from yes sure
[1:13:44] now I want to just think of this for a
[1:13:47] moment this this Pride let me just let
[1:13:48] me dwell on this here just a few moments
[1:13:51] on this Avenue of it in Ephesians 5 I
[1:13:54] don't have this up here cuz I I just
[1:13:56] want to refer to it when you think back
[1:13:58] in Ephesians 5 maybe if you want to
[1:14:00] write it down and or maybe open your
[1:14:02] Bibles to it or look back over here in
[1:14:05] in the after after service but the whole
[1:14:07] thing with Ephesians 5 beginning in
[1:14:09] verse 21 even through verse 28 listen
[1:14:13] you or I could not help ourselves that's
[1:14:17] right we were without any way
[1:14:19] out I don't know about you there's
[1:14:22] sometimes I still feel that way
[1:14:25] not just sometimes let me be honest a
[1:14:27] many times but when I say sometimes it's
[1:14:30] because sometimes God allows the
[1:14:32] realization to come to Samuel you're
[1:14:34] nothing without
[1:14:37] me you you didn't pull yourself out of
[1:14:40] sin I came to where you were at I'm the
[1:14:43] one that took care of the conditions in
[1:14:46] your life I'm the one who changed your
[1:14:49] nature I'm the one who became flesh I'm
[1:14:51] the one who shed my blood I'm the one
[1:14:54] who came look looking for you I'm the
[1:14:56] one who brought you to myself I'm the
[1:14:59] one who found you I'm the one who turned
[1:15:01] your heart I'm the one who dealt with
[1:15:03] your life I am the savior of the body
[1:15:07] hallelujah oh God let that be the anthem
[1:15:11] of our life he is my
[1:15:15] everything and let me tell you if you
[1:15:17] think about it think about it brother
[1:15:18] Brian how many times brother Brian would
[1:15:20] brother Brian brother Brandon would say
[1:15:21] over and over in the message he would
[1:15:23] say he said look if he saved you if he
[1:15:26] delivered you can't he heal your
[1:15:31] body he's got it all covered brother
[1:15:34] he's everything he's Jehovah JRA he's
[1:15:37] Jehovah Raa he's Jehovah Shalom he's
[1:15:39] Jehovah Tish he's
[1:15:42] everything all that I have need of he is
[1:15:49] everything
[1:15:51] so just being honest right ah many of
[1:15:54] the times I come into those places I say
[1:15:57] Lord H I really need you now I need him
[1:16:00] all the time but there's other times God
[1:16:03] just you know God God allows us to come
[1:16:05] into situations that there is no way
[1:16:08] human instrumentality that we can get
[1:16:11] ourselves out we can't even put two and
[1:16:15] two together in our mind but that's
[1:16:17] where our heart as a Believer this is
[1:16:20] where Faith this is where trust comes in
[1:16:23] just says yet Lord though I can look all
[1:16:26] around me yet will I trust in you no
[1:16:30] wonder David said what time I am afraid
[1:16:34] I will trust in you oh
[1:16:36] Lord
[1:16:38] hallelujah so there's times I I still
[1:16:40] need Deliverance am there's times I need
[1:16:43] Deliverance all of us can Fellowship on
[1:16:46] this sometimes our thoughts we get down
[1:16:49] the wrong channel in our thoughts come
[1:16:51] on we get the entertaining all it takes
[1:16:53] is one thought and we get to entertain
[1:16:55] in that one thought and we can start
[1:16:57] getting filling down and filling down
[1:16:59] and you know what it isn't you rescuing
[1:17:01] yourself it's him that rescues you you
[1:17:04] might say well I thought about this
[1:17:05] scripture who is it that dropped that
[1:17:08] scripture in your way I'll tell you who
[1:17:10] it is it's the same God that sent the
[1:17:12] Ravens to Elijah and brought him bread
[1:17:14] it's the same God that sees you in the
[1:17:17] conditions where you're at and he let
[1:17:19] you know I'm your savior I'm your
[1:17:21] deliverer I'm your comforter I'm your
[1:17:23] all in all
[1:17:27] Hallelujah glory be to
[1:17:29] [Applause]
[1:17:31] God oh my I feel like
[1:17:35] running but I got to
[1:17:39] preach watch this look look at this
[1:17:41] statement here a pride man's Pride shall
[1:17:44] bring him low but honor shall uphold the
[1:17:47] humble in spirit and say God keep me
[1:17:51] humble keep me humble I know there's a
[1:17:54] respon responsibility to laid on you and
[1:17:56] I but Lord You're the you're the one
[1:17:59] who's able to keep me where I need to be
[1:18:02] kept you know why for him for him lest I
[1:18:07] should get
[1:18:09] exalted let me read this this this this
[1:18:12] quote here my goodness I got to look at
[1:18:14] this some time ago my Lord let let's
[1:18:16] just read it here brother BR said God
[1:18:17] intended this church to be a powerful
[1:18:20] Church a glorious Church a church that
[1:18:23] the whole world could look up Bor as a
[1:18:25] bride of Christ well expected and
[1:18:28] espoused and to live in such an
[1:18:30] atmosphere and conduct itself in such a
[1:18:33] way that God would be proud of this
[1:18:35] church to present it to Christ at the
[1:18:38] coming of the Lord it should live in
[1:18:40] that characteristic in the church it
[1:18:43] should be living that way but he said we
[1:18:45] find out too many times that good
[1:18:47] intentions that people are trying to
[1:18:49] make themselves act like Christians and
[1:18:52] they're trying to say I'm thus and I'm
[1:18:54] this and I must live this way that's not
[1:18:57] God's objective no sir brother brandham
[1:19:01] just said it very clearly in Christ is
[1:19:03] the mystery of God revealed when God
[1:19:05] listen when God came became flesh he
[1:19:09] took his word upon
[1:19:12] himself is that right the Bible said he
[1:19:15] he uh uh he who knew no sin
[1:19:18] became right became our sin that we
[1:19:21] might be made the very righteousness of
[1:19:23] God in Christ he he he became he was
[1:19:27] born of a
[1:19:28] woman right he he came listen if you and
[1:19:31] I needed Redemption he didn't need
[1:19:34] Redemption but Redemption is about
[1:19:37] bringing back what belongs to one you
[1:19:39] always belong to him you were always a
[1:19:43] part of him let me tell you the whole
[1:19:45] mystery of God all the way through the
[1:19:47] scriptures this is a drama that's been
[1:19:50] unfolded from the mind of God all the
[1:19:53] way down and we take us completely into
[1:19:56] the future
[1:19:57] home but it's all about him coming to
[1:20:00] redeem you and I bring us back to
[1:20:02] himself and notice we are his
[1:20:05] achievement and notice that statement
[1:20:07] that we would live in such an atmosphere
[1:20:10] and conduct ourselves in such a way that
[1:20:12] God would be proud of this
[1:20:15] church now remember there's a difference
[1:20:19] in man's Pride or that Pride that come
[1:20:22] from the enemy and God's Pride
[1:20:25] God's Pride will always stay in line
[1:20:28] that proud he's it's a display of
[1:20:31] himself of his character of his life
[1:20:34] it's actually his glory on display you
[1:20:38] know the scripture would say it like
[1:20:39] this it says for by grace are you saved
[1:20:42] through faith right well I did this and
[1:20:45] I sought after God no you didn't God
[1:20:47] sought after
[1:20:49] you well you know I begin to serve the
[1:20:51] Lord no God begin to turn your heart to
[1:20:53] desire to to serve
[1:20:55] him oh you know I was seeking no God
[1:20:58] wasn't lost we were lost he came and
[1:21:01] found
[1:21:03] us for by grace are you Sav through
[1:21:06] faith and that not of yourselves it is
[1:21:10] the gift of God not of Works lest any
[1:21:15] man should
[1:21:17] boast well I stopped doing this and I
[1:21:19] stopped doing that brother Bram says it
[1:21:21] in the Jubilee year he says many people
[1:21:23] say well I stop drinking and I stopped
[1:21:25] smoking and I stopped doing all that
[1:21:27] then if you stopped it then you have
[1:21:29] something to glory in but you see listen
[1:21:32] brother Ram goes on to say it he said
[1:21:34] but what it is it's to accept the person
[1:21:37] of Christ and then when he comes in all
[1:21:41] things
[1:21:43] cease are you hearing me when he comes
[1:21:45] in because Sin Sin as Sin is unbelief
[1:21:50] all these other things are attributes
[1:21:52] when he comes in he kills sin unbelief
[1:21:56] and so the attribute
[1:21:59] cease glory be to God I'm telling you
[1:22:02] this ain't self-help this is the gospel
[1:22:04] in demonstration and power that comes to
[1:22:07] work in our life and Deliver Us and cut
[1:22:10] away us from our first
[1:22:13] birth it's not of ourselves well I
[1:22:15] stopped this no I I didn't stop nothing
[1:22:19] amen as a matter of fact when God got a
[1:22:21] hold of my life oh there was a fear that
[1:22:23] came around my my life cuz I knew I what
[1:22:25] I had tried to stop I knew how I had
[1:22:28] tried to
[1:22:29] Live come on I don't disregard any of
[1:22:33] them previous experiences that I had
[1:22:35] maybe at this meeting or that meeting
[1:22:37] I'm just saying that what it was is God
[1:22:39] had to get my attention Samuel don't
[1:22:41] look at
[1:22:42] yourself I never spoke to you or called
[1:22:45] you that you would start looking at
[1:22:47] yourself look unto
[1:22:50] me I'm the author and finisher of your
[1:22:53] faith I'm the dissolver of all your
[1:22:55] doubts don't look at me and then look at
[1:22:57] yourself look at me who's speaking to
[1:22:59] you cuz I know what's in your
[1:23:02] life I know what's beneath the
[1:23:07] darkness hallu my my my Lord how many
[1:23:11] could say thank you Lord for we are
[1:23:15] his
[1:23:17] workmanship we're his workmanship means
[1:23:21] proprietorship meaning I'm I'm his I'm
[1:23:24] his personal work
[1:23:26] oh what you see is what he has done
[1:23:31] hallelujah oh I'm not perfect in myself
[1:23:33] but my perfection is in him and that
[1:23:37] Perfection of his life in me which is
[1:23:39] the changing of your desire that where
[1:23:42] our desire is is I want to do that which
[1:23:45] pleases him that's what allows the word
[1:23:47] to operate in our life and bring
[1:23:50] correction in our life and build in our
[1:23:52] life it's that desire that work Works in
[1:23:54] our heart by the holy spirit amen we're
[1:23:58] his workmanship
[1:24:00] amen we're not the workmanship of a
[1:24:02] church that's right are you with me you
[1:24:06] got listen fr the prophet tells us in
[1:24:08] Satan's Eden he says many times he said
[1:24:11] sometimes he said we find he said that
[1:24:13] we with Ministry he said is wanting to
[1:24:15] present themselves he said and Satan's
[1:24:18] desire is to establish himself in the
[1:24:20] people's hearts he said sometimes it's
[1:24:23] it's bringing an image into people's
[1:24:24] life I don't want you to be Samuel
[1:24:26] brownings God don't want you to be
[1:24:28] Samuel brownings he don't want you to be
[1:24:29] Browning
[1:24:31] nightes that's not God's that that's not
[1:24:33] God's intention that that that's a
[1:24:35] selfish man-made something that come
[1:24:38] from Satan and you know what that's all
[1:24:41] about is to keep you from the life you
[1:24:43] say what do you say I'm not your
[1:24:45] objective Christ is your
[1:24:48] objective he's the one that's being set
[1:24:50] before you it's Jesus Christ what he's
[1:24:53] done in my life he'll do in your life
[1:24:55] what he's doing in our lives he'll
[1:24:57] continue to work do in our
[1:24:59] lives that's right Hallelujah you not
[1:25:02] been called to a Ministry you are called
[1:25:04] to Jesus
[1:25:06] Christ Hallelujah let me tell you
[1:25:09] something friends Baptists produce
[1:25:11] Baptist Pentecostals produce
[1:25:13] Pentecostals right Catholics produce
[1:25:15] Catholics but only only Jesus Christ can
[1:25:19] produce real true living Christians that
[1:25:22] are expressions of of his own life we're
[1:25:26] not called to be an expression of a
[1:25:28] church we are called to be the
[1:25:30] expression of the name of Jesus
[1:25:34] Christ
[1:25:36] hallelujah oh my from we his workmanship
[1:25:41] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:25:45] so in other words all everything he's
[1:25:48] already packed in
[1:25:49] you he just has to get us in condition
[1:25:52] to get it all out of us
[1:25:55] within one little seed has all of the
[1:25:57] apple seed has all of the leaves has all
[1:26:00] the
[1:26:02] apples all the Apple Chris you can make
[1:26:04] out of that's that that that that's my
[1:26:07] own private one right there but you
[1:26:09] inside of that and inside of that which
[1:26:11] God placed in your life what it is
[1:26:13] coming into his presence notice when
[1:26:16] Aaron's Rod got into his presence in his
[1:26:19] presence that Rod that part of an almond
[1:26:23] tree being in his presence what did it
[1:26:25] do it bued it blossomed it put forth
[1:26:28] leaves it bore almonds all in that
[1:26:33] place you know what that spoke up you
[1:26:35] would say that was a branch off of an
[1:26:37] almond tree and it was growing there
[1:26:39] without without being attached to the
[1:26:41] vine that was expressing Our Lives we
[1:26:45] were separated and alienated from the
[1:26:48] life of God but we couldn't get to where
[1:26:52] we needed to get to but God came down
[1:26:56] and he brought us into the holies of
[1:27:00] holies he said if I can just get Samuel
[1:27:03] there I'll just draw him there I'm not
[1:27:05] going to drive him there I'm not going
[1:27:06] to push him there I'm going to pour out
[1:27:09] my love I'm going to move on the rise of
[1:27:11] my word and get him in place and I will
[1:27:14] bring out of him what I know lays there
[1:27:25] Hallelujah I want you to love
[1:27:28] him now
[1:27:31] God's God has the right kind of
[1:27:34] a it's not a this parental Pride you
[1:27:39] know sometimes God's not looking at you
[1:27:42] and I and looks over our life and says
[1:27:45] well there ain't nothing wrong with them
[1:27:47] everything they do is is just ride on
[1:27:50] the
[1:27:51] money you know what
[1:27:55] if God wanted to he could have had it at
[1:27:58] this thing he could have had it to such
[1:28:01] a place to where you and I would have
[1:28:03] looked at Elijah and said Lord have
[1:28:04] mercy who could ever live a life like
[1:28:06] that he could have edited Abraham's life
[1:28:09] and you and I could have said
[1:28:11] goodness I don't think there's any
[1:28:13] chance for me he could have edited in
[1:28:16] such a way cuz you know what you do when
[1:28:19] you edit some of you are writers you
[1:28:20] know what I'm talking about when you
[1:28:21] edit you know you write something a lot
[1:28:23] of times they tell you just just get
[1:28:24] your thoughts on paper
[1:28:26] uh oh God just get them down and and you
[1:28:29] know just don't worry about it don't
[1:28:30] worry about it just write it out right
[1:28:31] now we we'll edit it it'll it'll get
[1:28:33] sent to an editor let me tell you
[1:28:35] something God's thoughts were being
[1:28:37] poured out even through the frailties
[1:28:39] and Humanity of Abraham and Noah and
[1:28:42] Elijah and when it came to
[1:28:45] Calvary The Mercy Seat it edited out all
[1:28:49] that was in Abraham it edited out all
[1:28:52] that was in Isaiah all said well you
[1:28:54] know what it was because it was Christ
[1:28:57] all the way
[1:29:00] through that's why when he asked who do
[1:29:03] men say that I am some say some say th
[1:29:06] are Isaiah some say th are Jeremiah some
[1:29:09] say why it was Christ in them in a
[1:29:15] portion and when Calvary came
[1:29:22] Hallelujah when Cal
[1:29:27] came here's the Old Testament there was
[1:29:29] a new when Calvary came oh my when the
[1:29:32] blood was shed it would not allow the
[1:29:35] mistakes and failures of Abraham to pass
[1:29:40] through over to the New Testament it
[1:29:43] wouldn't allow it and let me tell you
[1:29:44] something your name has been
[1:29:47] transferred your name has been
[1:29:49] transferred from the old book into the
[1:29:53] new book into the lamb section which you
[1:29:56] always were and you know what the blood
[1:29:58] of Jesus Christ will not allow sin to be
[1:30:02] attributed to your account blessed is
[1:30:06] the man in whom God will not impute
[1:30:11] sin
[1:30:14] Hallelujah brother that's something I
[1:30:17] can brag on right
[1:30:19] there I don't have nothing in myself I
[1:30:22] can brag on but I can brag on him I can
[1:30:25] brag on what he's done in my
[1:30:32] life so parental Pride it isn't that God
[1:30:36] just looking over our lives and you know
[1:30:38] just looking no no no no no no no God's
[1:30:40] hands on I said he's hands
[1:30:44] on God when he takes a hold of your life
[1:30:46] he's hands
[1:30:48] on I don't care of times that you may
[1:30:50] not feel him he's right there he said
[1:30:53] I'll never leave you no forsake
[1:30:55] you he's right there he's the same God
[1:30:58] that's with us through every test and
[1:31:00] every trial through every correction
[1:31:02] even when somebody begins to look you
[1:31:04] you know how this is you we can
[1:31:05] Fellowship on this when you first the
[1:31:07] Bible tells like this when we first were
[1:31:09] illuminated Hebrews 10 after we were
[1:31:11] illuminated we endured a great flight of
[1:31:13] of afflictions in other words we had
[1:31:16] persecution that came our way we had
[1:31:18] things where where all of this all of a
[1:31:19] sudden friends that we didn't know we
[1:31:21] had friends that showed up and different
[1:31:22] ones they weren't trying to encourage
[1:31:24] just they were trying to say you don't
[1:31:25] need to do all that I mean that's a
[1:31:26] little bit overboard but wait a minute
[1:31:28] it's not about something I'm trying to
[1:31:30] do you don't know the person that I've
[1:31:32] met this person that's touched my life
[1:31:35] when the woman at the well ran from the
[1:31:37] well she said come see
[1:31:40] amen that had told me all things it was
[1:31:44] the person that she met not an
[1:31:48] idea an idea would never change her from
[1:31:52] the lifestyle she was in
[1:31:56] ideas had condemned her ideas had
[1:31:59] isolated her to where she couldn't come
[1:32:02] to the well at a certain time but when
[1:32:04] he came
[1:32:07] hallelujah
[1:32:08] hallelujah he took care of what was in
[1:32:11] her
[1:32:13] life Hallelujah and when he came into
[1:32:16] her life you know what he did he out of
[1:32:18] her life only thing was coming forth
[1:32:20] there was things there was
[1:32:21] unrighteousness and all of this but he
[1:32:24] went down to the depths of her
[1:32:26] life and the well that was laying in her
[1:32:30] life he unsealed it he came in and
[1:32:34] exposed a hidden Source in her life he
[1:32:38] anointed her heart with his
[1:32:41] presence Hallelujah Lord have mercy
[1:32:47] Hallelujah so this parental Pride it
[1:32:51] isn't that we don't get spanking and
[1:32:52] Corrections what we do
[1:32:54] oh we do oh we do we we get
[1:32:57] Corrections sure we do thank God for
[1:33:00] them thank God for the Holy Spirit
[1:33:02] that'll go off in our life to say
[1:33:04] hey that's right thank God for the word
[1:33:08] that'll come around our way thank God
[1:33:10] for for God having surrendered vessels
[1:33:13] that would be willing to surrender to
[1:33:14] him and God could speak through it may
[1:33:16] not even be through a forceful way it
[1:33:18] might just be in such a little simple
[1:33:20] maybe teaching whatever more but he'll
[1:33:22] come and we recogniz his voice and what
[1:33:25] he's doing is calling us back in
[1:33:27] line you know why cuz he loves
[1:33:30] us he knows what he's called us to God's
[1:33:34] correction is not
[1:33:35] erratic in other words it's not get out
[1:33:37] of my face you're bothering me
[1:33:39] today amen I've just had a bad day man
[1:33:42] I'm fed up don't don't even cross my
[1:33:43] path that's not that's not that's not

[1:33:49] moment that's all right go ahead and
[1:33:50] raise your hands I will too say help me
[1:33:52] Lord help me Lord
[1:33:54] help me Lord because he's never I'm glad
[1:33:56] I'm glad that he's never you know why
[1:33:58] cuz I can draw from him he's the source
[1:34:01] that helps me and when I seem to get
[1:34:03] frustrated or feel frustrated in my
[1:34:05] spirit I've got a source a place that I
[1:34:08] can go to and let off the
[1:34:11] [Applause]

[1:34:26] are not stock pots what about sister
[1:34:29] pressure cookers right pressure cookers
[1:34:31] you know how it is I've been over
[1:34:32] place's house people's house and things
[1:34:34] like that Brother Carlos and I went to
[1:34:36] go visit a brother one time we were over
[1:34:37] at his house in an apartment there some
[1:34:39] years ago and they were telling me about
[1:34:40] when a pressure cooker went off man and
[1:34:42] blew I think it was in that place blew
[1:34:43] potatoes everywhere all and all I could
[1:34:45] do I was sitting there on and I you know
[1:34:47] I was trying to talk to the brother I
[1:34:48] had to get out of my mind what does this
[1:34:50] look like with potatoes all over it
[1:34:56] I had to get myself back in line you
[1:34:58] know but you know think about it how
[1:35:00] many times have we we blown more than
[1:35:02] potatoes
[1:35:03] everywhere sometimes there's been some
[1:35:05] clean up that we've had to do and say
[1:35:06] forgive me brother forgive me forgive me
[1:35:09] honey forgive my wife to my husband to
[1:35:11] my wife to my children forgive me you
[1:35:13] know uh just something right right you
[1:35:15] know what it was it ain't nothing it
[1:35:16] ain't you it in conditions you know what
[1:35:18] I I just wasn't letting off the pressure
[1:35:20] where I needed to be
[1:35:24] are you catching that this morning you
[1:35:25] know what that's about that's about him
[1:35:27] so there's nobody Among Us that's
[1:35:29] getting lifted up like oh my if I could
[1:35:31] just be like sister Stephanie if I if I
[1:35:33] could just be like you know sister
[1:35:34] Shirley if I could just be like sister
[1:35:36] Irma no no God's not interested in
[1:35:38] elevating any he's interested in
[1:35:41] elevating himself in our lives so that
[1:35:44] we can see Christ to know what he is in
[1:35:47] one he isn't
[1:35:49] another
[1:35:50] woo I'm trying to get through this here
[1:35:55] parental
[1:35:57] Pride God doesn't he doesn't withhold
[1:35:59] correction and I'm glad for it you know
[1:36:02] uh when you think about it let me just
[1:36:04] read the Scripture it says my son in
[1:36:07] Hebrews 12 despise not thou the
[1:36:10] chastening of the
[1:36:11] Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:36:15] him I think that's a I think that's
[1:36:17] tremendous because anybody here like
[1:36:20] dispas in the Lord no I won't ask you
[1:36:24] how you feel cuz I know how you feel I
[1:36:26] know how you feel but see God's desire
[1:36:28] is that we would not
[1:36:30] faint but he makes a way that our lives
[1:36:33] would be
[1:36:35] corrected see his desire is not to crush
[1:36:38] us demean us exasperate us take life out
[1:36:42] of us no no he says we just need to get
[1:36:44] this corrected out right here I mean you
[1:36:46] know how it is if you told your child
[1:36:48] not to do this and you said no don't do
[1:36:50] that and they go ahead and do it well
[1:36:51] you correct them why you correct because
[1:36:54] that right there that you told them not
[1:36:55] to touch hot stove or whatever more I
[1:36:57] mean for some reason kids just they hot
[1:36:59] I wonder what this is once they get that
[1:37:01] experience they never ask again but you
[1:37:03] know there's certain things you tell
[1:37:04] them to do and they go ahead and do it
[1:37:05] then why do you correct them you don't
[1:37:07] correct them just for the sake of
[1:37:08] correcting them you correct them because
[1:37:10] you know that could bring them great
[1:37:12] harm and that's the same thing when God
[1:37:14] corrects you or I he knows what is
[1:37:17] laying down the
[1:37:19] road it's like when a man is sighting in
[1:37:21] a gun and when we sight in our bows to
[1:37:23] go hunting if you're off if you're off
[1:37:26] right here just even at 5 yards 10 yards
[1:37:29] then if you're off there you've got to
[1:37:30] get that 10 yard pin sided in then you
[1:37:33] can get the 20 yard pin then you can get
[1:37:35] the 30 yard pin sided in see you got to
[1:37:38] start with things that are very close
[1:37:40] then it allows you to move on to things
[1:37:43] that are further
[1:37:44] away does that make sense it's how God
[1:37:48] is working with those things getting us
[1:37:49] lined up because let me tell you
[1:37:50] something God's got the goal for your
[1:37:52] your life and my life and that's the
[1:37:55] Rapture that's the change of the body
[1:37:57] that that's God's goal that's why all
[1:37:59] the correction that's why the ministry
[1:38:01] of the word that's why he deals with our
[1:38:03] life that's why tests and Trials come
[1:38:05] the way they do is because God has a
[1:38:08] goal in
[1:38:09] mind and that goal is himself being
[1:38:15] raptured himself being
[1:38:18] raptured you are bone of his bone flesh
[1:38:21] of his flesh life of his life
[1:38:24] you are
[1:38:26] him in bright
[1:38:31] form all right let me just Stout for a
[1:38:34] minute back in
[1:38:36] Eden here God brought forth Adam and
[1:38:39] then Adam was the bride
[1:38:42] right but after
[1:38:45] Calvary here where his side was open
[1:38:47] which Adam was a prefigure of
[1:38:51] Calvary right out of his side was open
[1:38:55] out came in out come water blood and
[1:38:57] spirit those three things agree in one
[1:39:01] to bring about the real true birth in
[1:39:05] the life of a Believer and now here
[1:39:08] stands a people a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:39:12] and now he is the one veiled in her
[1:39:16] Hallelujah Calvary produced The Hidden
[1:39:20] man of the
[1:39:21] heart it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:39:25] glory you are his achievement you are
[1:39:28] his
[1:39:29] workmanship that's what Calvary has
[1:39:38] produced so this is where don't don't
[1:39:41] faint when you're rebuked of him the
[1:39:43] scripture said as many as I love I
[1:39:47] rebuke and
[1:39:49] chasing not as many as love me as many
[1:39:53] as I
[1:39:55] love that's why the prophet said don't
[1:39:57] ever make don't ever make Jesus the
[1:39:59] object of human love he said that's not
[1:40:00] what the scripture said it didn't say as
[1:40:02] many as love me it says as many as I
[1:40:04] love
[1:40:06] right it makes you think about rebuking
[1:40:09] and chasing a little
[1:40:11] different now honestly I I don't like
[1:40:14] rebuking and chastening but it kind of
[1:40:16] lets you know it was like you know the
[1:40:18] football coach that I had in syusy he
[1:40:20] just would stop us when we came out
[1:40:21] there he said it every single year I
[1:40:23] play for him he said let me tell you
[1:40:24] something boys he said before we start
[1:40:26] this year he said there's going to be
[1:40:27] times he said where the coaches he said
[1:40:29] we're going to he said we're going to
[1:40:30] get on you now now my coach was one he
[1:40:32] didn't believe in swearing if you swear
[1:40:34] you might as well shut your mouth you
[1:40:35] didn't have nothing worth saying anyhow
[1:40:36] so we don't have to worry about none of
[1:40:37] that but man he he said look we're going
[1:40:39] to get on you he said the reason we'll
[1:40:40] get on you he said because we know
[1:40:42] there's you've got more in you than what
[1:40:44] you're putting
[1:40:45] out now to me those are things I just I
[1:40:49] I I carried right over here because I
[1:40:50] realize when when God gets on me he
[1:40:52] ain't running me down he's letting me
[1:40:53] say Samuel you got more potential in you
[1:40:56] than that and he's not asking me for my
[1:40:59] efforts he's asking me to surrender my
[1:41:04] will he's not asking me put forth a
[1:41:06] greater effort put forth a no he's
[1:41:08] asking me surrender yes you know how
[1:41:12] they tell you when they go to give you a
[1:41:13] shot they don't tell you tense
[1:41:15] up they don't tell you to tense up they
[1:41:17] say
[1:41:18] relax s Mariel is that right they tell
[1:41:21] you to relax right when they're going
[1:41:22] ready to give you shot
[1:41:24] relax right
[1:41:26] relax just look the other
[1:41:30] way you smell that alcohol you're like
[1:41:32] Lord help
[1:41:34] me remember from Thursday Lord I trust
[1:41:37] they got the numbing
[1:41:40] agent but notice this this is why
[1:41:44] brother Brandon would say this you've
[1:41:45] heard this quote many different times I
[1:41:47] think it's I know it's very simple but
[1:41:49] it's things brother BR would pull it
[1:41:50] into our spiritual walk with God out of
[1:41:53] the message perfect strength and perfect
[1:41:54] weakness and he would say it in this way
[1:41:58] he said you know he said many times he
[1:42:00] said with your child would come and
[1:42:02] they've got a test to take he said how
[1:42:05] how fitting it would be to get them
[1:42:07] together and just pray with them say you
[1:42:09] know what let let's approach God Amen
[1:42:13] you know what I'm talking about I mean
[1:42:14] there's you know you you as parents will
[1:42:16] help out we'll help our children we'll
[1:42:18] you know do different things but we
[1:42:19] can't go and sit down in the desk or
[1:42:21] anymore they go on a computer and take a
[1:42:22] test and we we can't be there and do it
[1:42:24] I mean sister Mercy you work in that
[1:42:26] room over there at the college and you
[1:42:27] know parents can't go in there I've
[1:42:29] walked my boys over there and sister
[1:42:30] mercy and I wave through the window and
[1:42:32] you know when I had to drive them to
[1:42:33] school and they go in there and test and
[1:42:35] so forth and you're out there praying
[1:42:37] Lord give them wisdom Lord help them
[1:42:38] Lord to bring things back to their mind
[1:42:40] and and things like that but let me just
[1:42:42] sh let me share you this maybe as this
[1:42:43] would go along the one thing I've prayed
[1:42:45] with the boys and I've just looked at it
[1:42:47] from from my my journey what what I
[1:42:49] prayed for and actually where this come
[1:42:50] from was when God first got a hold my
[1:42:52] life I heard the Bisal say something he
[1:42:54] said you know may God help our young
[1:42:56] people to only go in and God only allow
[1:42:59] them to gather what needs to be gathered
[1:43:01] for what they need to do in life don't
[1:43:03] let them Gather in all the other junk
[1:43:05] and in this day and age we can say in
[1:43:07] Amen to that Amen to that but but what
[1:43:11] I'll ask for is this because remember
[1:43:12] brother Brown tells us in key to the
[1:43:14] door that message he preaches he said
[1:43:15] there's a key to mathematics there's a
[1:43:17] key to music right I mean there's like
[1:43:19] that aha moment we have key to science
[1:43:21] key to this so the things the way that I
[1:43:23] the way that I've prayed for myself and
[1:43:25] then I pray with the boys and things is
[1:43:27] ask them God give them understanding in
[1:43:29] the ways that they need to understand I
[1:43:31] don't want them just to get A's on the
[1:43:33] test or B's on the test because you and
[1:43:35] I both know there's no doubt well I may
[1:43:37] don't want to say this because I don't
[1:43:38] know if anybody's got a surgery coming
[1:43:40] up or not I just don't want somebody who
[1:43:42] got all A's on a test I want somebody
[1:43:44] who had who knows what they're doing
[1:43:46] more than just book smarts cuz there's a
[1:43:48] lot of people that are book smart that
[1:43:50] are common sense dumb
[1:43:53] that's true I know that wasn't very you
[1:43:55] know maybe Pleasant or what more but
[1:43:56] it's truth you know what I'm talking
[1:43:57] about sometimes there's things that
[1:43:59] people are just too smart for their own
[1:44:01] good right then that's not how work Life
[1:44:04] Works life don't work like that of a
[1:44:05] book oh my let's preach now can we
[1:44:07] that's the same way it is with this
[1:44:09] right here it's not about being ever so
[1:44:11] book smart it's about the author of the
[1:44:13] book coming in and living his life
[1:44:15] through you and I he's the one that
[1:44:17] brings it's his intelligence that sets
[1:44:19] down in our life and then as the word of
[1:44:21] God it begins to find get place in our
[1:44:24] life and we begin to say a now I see
[1:44:26] what God was doing in Elijah a now I see
[1:44:29] what God was saying here a now I see see
[1:44:32] it don't take us away from the Bible the
[1:44:34] spirit of Truth brings us into the word
[1:44:38] it's God breathing understanding in our
[1:44:45] lives let me finish this
[1:44:49] quote brother BR said like this cuz I
[1:44:52] think it's fitting he says you know he
[1:44:54] said I would
[1:44:56] rather he said so many times he said I'd
[1:44:59] rather my boy I don't know how this
[1:45:01] happens but he said I'd rather my boy
[1:45:03] get a good decent F on his card now some
[1:45:07] of the young people in here listen to me
[1:45:09] now
[1:45:10] this don't tun me on
[1:45:13] now some of you like send me that quote
[1:45:15] on the thread Brother
[1:45:17] Sam but just watch the point the point
[1:45:20] the point I'd rather my boy get a good
[1:45:23] an F on his card to flunk than to know
[1:45:25] he got a straight A and cheated over
[1:45:29] it brother B goes on to say very next
[1:45:32] statement what we need is to lose our
[1:45:34] self and wholly depend upon the power of
[1:45:39] God you see what would be within that
[1:45:43] something that's not we know I've got
[1:45:46] achieve to this or I've got to move to
[1:45:48] this but see God's desire
[1:45:50] is even in our lives listen
[1:45:54] sometimes we've had good decent
[1:45:56] Fs in our spiritual walk
[1:46:00] failings I don't know if there's such a
[1:46:02] mark in school as an M
[1:46:06] mistake right sometimes we've got D's do
[1:46:09] it
[1:46:11] yourself right but God's
[1:46:14] desire is that
[1:46:17] he we would wholly depend on
[1:46:21] him that and Lord it's not something
[1:46:24] where God see in other words God isn't
[1:46:26] trying to give you and I all the answers
[1:46:29] when you go through a test or trial do
[1:46:31] you know what's taking place don't
[1:46:33] answer that because you you don't I
[1:46:35] don't either sometimes we don't even
[1:46:36] know we're in the midst of a test or
[1:46:37] trial right sometimes the first thing we
[1:46:39] which as a Believer we start looking at
[1:46:41] is there some way Lord that I'm missing
[1:46:42] the Mark I think that's a wonderful
[1:46:45] thing that's a quality of a Believer we
[1:46:47] don't want to walk around presuming oh
[1:46:49] oh pray for me this test or trial and it
[1:46:51] may not be a test or trial it may be
[1:46:53] correcting us right but there's one sure
[1:46:56] thing for sure if we'll turn every stone
[1:46:58] over and know Lord there's nothing in my
[1:47:00] heart there's nothing Lord that's
[1:47:01] against you then we can be certain of
[1:47:03] God and say Lord your grace is
[1:47:05] sufficient not only to lead me when I've
[1:47:07] been wrong and correct me but your grace
[1:47:08] is sufficient in the trial or the test
[1:47:11] that I'm in presently you see you can't
[1:47:13] get away from his grace when you
[1:47:14] recognize him his grace is a present
[1:47:18] attribute of himself
[1:47:24] my my my you love
[1:47:27] him okay let me try to let me try to
[1:47:30] round this part out because I'm not
[1:47:31] going to even get to where we are
[1:47:33] looking at here but let's just try to
[1:47:35] round this out so when it comes down to
[1:47:38] it this is where it comes to our
[1:47:42] glory is
[1:47:44] him remember what David said I in the
[1:47:47] psalm when he said Thou Art Thou Art my
[1:47:50] shield my glory the lifter of my head is
[1:47:55] that
[1:47:57] right let me just pull it with this in
[1:47:59] Jeremiah chapter n thus sayith the Lord
[1:48:03] let not the wise man glory in his wisdom
[1:48:08] neither let the Mighty Man glory in his
[1:48:11] might let not the rich man glory in his
[1:48:16] riches but let him that glorieth glory
[1:48:21] in this
[1:48:23] that he understandeth and knoweth
[1:48:27] me yes sir yes
[1:48:30] sir that I'm the Lord which exercise
[1:48:34] loving kindness judgment righteousness
[1:48:37] in the Earth for in these things I
[1:48:39] Delight saith the
[1:48:42] Lord so if there's any
[1:48:45] Glory it's in him
[1:48:48] amen we are what we
[1:48:51] are by the the grace of
[1:48:54] God we are his achievement you now you
[1:48:57] might look at that and say what does
[1:48:59] that have to do with pride when we as we
[1:49:02] staying in his presence and let that
[1:49:04] ever be the anthem of our life that it's
[1:49:07] him he's the one that's done the work
[1:49:10] he's the one that's doing the working
[1:49:12] and God brings us back to that place
[1:49:15] over and over to remind us why as we can
[1:49:19] see that and I tell you what it'll take
[1:49:22] take care of
[1:49:23] Pride remember we don't have to be
[1:49:26] sprayed with all sorts
[1:49:29] of let me kill this bug of pride no no
[1:49:32] no what God has to do we get in his
[1:49:35] presence and what he's already already
[1:49:38] put in US he'll bring out of us amen and
[1:49:41] let me just tell you something as a dove
[1:49:44] are you hearing me as a dove a dove has
[1:49:46] a natural oil on the inside and that oil
[1:49:50] on the inside Works its way to the
[1:49:52] outside
[1:49:53] and so any little bugs or anything she's
[1:49:55] picked up in her wings that oil on the
[1:49:59] inside will work its way to the outside
[1:50:01] and you know what it does it
[1:50:03] loosens the hold of those things on our
[1:50:06] life where does that cleansing come from
[1:50:08] from inside that
[1:50:10] dve where does that cleansing come from
[1:50:13] it comes from his life on the inside of
[1:50:16] you and I as we're dwelling in his life
[1:50:19] amen but sometimes our battle is because
[1:50:23] not that we willfully not that we would
[1:50:26] just kind of turn away from but Satan's
[1:50:28] desire is to always snare us and try to
[1:50:31] bring us back down into that place let
[1:50:34] me I'm closing I'm just going to stop
[1:50:37] here no matter where a person is in
[1:50:41] their walk with God no matter where you
[1:50:44] might be in your walk with
[1:50:46] God it's always in that place that Lord
[1:50:51] let me keep my my eyes on
[1:50:55] you because listen it's not by might nor
[1:51:00] by power it's by my spirit saith the
[1:51:06] Lord God never intends you within a
[1:51:10] service listen we want to examine our
[1:51:12] lives right but I don't want to examine
[1:51:14] my life apart from the word because when
[1:51:17] I'm examining all right now stay with me
[1:51:19] now just a minute examining my life with
[1:51:21] the word I want to examine it with the
[1:51:23] spirit of love that it came
[1:51:26] in I want to examine it because remember
[1:51:29] he's not come to cast me down he's come
[1:51:31] as I can examine examine through his
[1:51:34] eyes and I can see my shortcomings I can
[1:51:38] see my weaknesses and what he's calling
[1:51:41] me to be you see God don't come in a
[1:51:43] service and just make known weaknesses
[1:51:45] and shortcomings but he shows us this is
[1:51:47] what I've called you to be and really
[1:51:49] what he's doing Brother Carlos is
[1:51:50] showing us what he's called us to be
[1:51:53] it shows up our
[1:51:55] weaknesses it shows where we're living
[1:51:58] beneath our privileges by showing us who
[1:52:00] we are where we need to be living and so
[1:52:03] when we examine it with that same love
[1:52:06] that he's brought it in and spoken it
[1:52:08] there's Grace that accompanies that our
[1:52:10] everything can be brought BR in line our
[1:52:12] hearts can be brought in line to say yes

[1:52:54] wanted in the Tabernacle and God knows
[1:52:57] what he wants in your life and

[1:54:06] me just say it like this in every area
[1:54:09] of our life I think it's a very very
[1:54:11] powerful thing let me just let me just
[1:54:13] say it like this I think it was a very
[1:54:14] powerful thing last Sunday I I tell you
[1:54:17] my my heart you know what it's so
[1:54:19] powerful is that God can come down and
[1:54:21] our hearts would be moved sometimes
[1:54:24] sometimes in our minds I might be a
[1:54:25] little ahead of myself but sometimes in
[1:54:27] our minds we we almost get to thinking
[1:54:29] just coming to the Altar and I'm not
[1:54:31] trying to bring you to the altar I'm
[1:54:32] just saying sometimes we feel like
[1:54:34] coming to an altar is all about oh
[1:54:36] somebody's a sinner I you know I don't
[1:54:38] come to the altar because I'm a sinner I
[1:54:40] come to the altar there's sometimes
[1:54:42] coming to the altar I just want to say
[1:54:43] thank
[1:54:45] you well brother Samuel I can say thank
[1:54:47] you I know I know I know we can say
[1:54:49] thank you in our seat but sometimes I
[1:54:51] come to the Altar and say Lord I need
[1:54:53] another I need more of your
[1:54:55] grace so it isn't about the altar isn't
[1:54:58] just a place well brother Samuel it's a
[1:54:59] place of dying I agree and I'm still
[1:55:02] dying to
[1:55:04] me Lord am is that all right I'm still
[1:55:09] dying to self but you see when it all
[1:55:13] comes down to it everything that's
[1:55:16] within our life no matter where no
[1:55:19] matter what it is he's the glory of our
[1:55:22] life
[1:55:26] life I begin to just just pour over a
[1:55:28] lot of these things looking at
[1:55:31] it I know God's mindful friends yes he
[1:55:34] is I know God's mindful that we would
[1:55:37] look and consider
[1:55:39] that that part
[1:55:41] lord it's because of
[1:55:44] you it's you in me it's God's desire to
[1:55:49] live his own life through you
[1:55:52] amen and if there's any anything that
[1:55:56] sometimes we like I said sometimes we
[1:55:57] can't find out if there's any hindrance
[1:55:59] we don't just walk around and say man I
[1:56:01] wonder if I got a hindrance but our just
[1:56:03] staying in that place and that
[1:56:05] Fellowship sometimes we can feel you
[1:56:06] know what I'm talking about you can feel
[1:56:08] when things are a little bit out of line
[1:56:10] anybody know I'm talking about I know it
[1:56:12] ain't just me you can kind of feel that
[1:56:13] you say Lord what is it and sometimes it
[1:56:16] isn't anything outside of we really
[1:56:20] haven't got into his presence
[1:56:22] right well brother brother Samuel I
[1:56:25] prayed but but sometimes sometimes
[1:56:26] sometimes our prayer is on a
[1:56:30] schedule God doesn't want to fit into
[1:56:33] our schedule and he doesn't want neither
[1:56:35] does he want to add pressure to your
[1:56:37] life you see he don't want it to be oh I
[1:56:39] got to pray no listen you can talk with
[1:56:41] him at all
[1:56:46] times Hallelujah you can talk with him
[1:56:49] at all times I mean sometimes in
[1:56:50] throughout prayer sometimes prayer you
[1:56:53] know sometimes I might pray might it
[1:56:54] might be something you just pray just
[1:56:56] few minutes here then a few minutes down
[1:56:58] the road then a few minutes there and a
[1:56:59] few minutes there and then there's times
[1:57:00] there's times where we have extended
[1:57:02] time in prayer is that right but then
[1:57:04] there's other times just kind of you're
[1:57:05] going down and maybe 10 minutes here and
[1:57:07] 10 minutes but but something from your
[1:57:09] heart you know it's something even in
[1:57:10] the little times it's something from
[1:57:12] your heart that Lord I just got to steal
[1:57:14] away I got to tell you I love you I'm
[1:57:16] thinking about you right now I'm
[1:57:18] thinking about your goodness

[1:57:35] from
