[48:06] hey man it's good to be a Christian this
[48:10] morning
[48:11] hey man we're so thankful for the mercy
[48:14] of God just to really say I certainly
[48:19] appreciated the specials and neither
[48:25] the sunday-school those kids my goodness
[48:30] the instruments and Silas wasn't even
[48:32] playing his violin today so we've got to
[48:36] just really appreciate that he's I got
[48:39] to hear it a little bit
[48:40] the a couple weeks ago I think it was I
[48:43] got a chance to come in here and sit
[48:45] down after the services were over and
[48:47] hear them playing and I think even
[48:50] Breanna plays the saxophone and things
[48:52] now as well and Jonathan just a
[48:56] tremendous job amen all the young people
[49:01] those singing those songs and I tell you
[49:04] some of those songs are a challenging
[49:06] songs I just have to listen to them but
[49:09] you know a lot of those those songs
[49:12] right there have such a meaning to it
[49:14] it's so tremendous when you if you ever
[49:17] have never even ever taken the
[49:18] opportunity to read the history behind
[49:21] those songs and I know they're they're
[49:24] sung we we hear a lot of it at Christmas
[49:27] time but it wasn't based around that
[49:30] much of the inspiration of just as some
[49:32] tremendous things that are wrote there
[49:35] and what it has a meaning to our hearts
[49:37] and so we just we thank God for that and
[49:40] I just want to say you you you kids did
[49:43] a wonderful job
[49:51] and of course they wouldn't have been
[49:54] there but sister Roseanne and somebody
[49:56] had to bring that all in line and that
[49:58] was a lot of work but to do that so
[50:00] thank you for that that's a lot of a lot
[50:04] of sacrifice there so well we want to
[50:06] turn our attention to the word and I'm
[50:10] just gonna see how the Lord will take us
[50:14] I don't know if I really have my
[50:18] preaching gear right now so we just
[50:21] we're just gonna look into the word and
[50:24] just see how the Lord will take us I'm
[50:27] not contagious or anything just so you
[50:29] know when I did get back and everything
[50:33] they did say I had bronchitis but so you
[50:38] just pray for me because even today I
[50:40] just had the boys pray for me before I
[50:43] came the church I just feel just you
[50:46] know how it is you're still just trying
[50:48] to gain strength you know back in your
[50:50] body but and that that tickling of the
[50:53] sometimes years from the coffin things
[50:55] I'm not complaining about myself I'm
[50:57] asking for your prayers because I it's
[50:59] it's so hard for me I don't like feeling
[51:01] this way
[51:01] of course nobody likes feeling that way
[51:03] you know but so let's just look to the
[51:06] word of the Lord this morning so good to
[51:08] see each and every one of you some of
[51:09] you haven't seen you in a little bit I
[51:11] know I've been out here with the
[51:14] when our youth retreat but we just want
[51:16] to turn here to number 15 and I want to
[51:19] look just a few verses of Scripture go
[51:21] back into our thought this morning on
[51:25] the offerings in the land of our
[51:28] habitation and just ask the Lord to help
[51:32] us this morning as we look into his word
[51:35] in verse 1 of numbers 15 says and the
[51:43] Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto
[51:47] the children of Israel and say unto them
[51:49] ye be come into the land of your
[51:52] habitations which I give unto you and
[51:55] will make an offering by fire unto the
[51:58] Lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice in
[52:02] performing a vow or in a free will
[52:05] offering or in solemn feast to make a
[52:08] sweet savour unto the Lord of the herd
[52:12] or of the flock then shall he that
[52:15] offered his offering unto the Lord bring
[52:18] a meat offering of a tenth deal flour
[52:21] mingled with a fourth part of the in
[52:23] Avoyelles the fourth part of the hint of
[52:26] wine for a drink offering shall prepare
[52:29] with the burnt offering for sacrifice
[52:32] for one Ram

[55:12] this of which
[55:14] Moses as we've been looking at it as
[55:16] given to the children of Israel this is
[55:22] something that even right after there's
[55:25] been a great failure that would be there
[55:33] in the midst of the camp but yet after
[55:37] all of those things are there was
[55:40] restitution there's atonement God comes
[55:44] right along in the beginning of this
[55:46] chapter and is this is what has stood
[55:48] out to me for some time now is God comes
[55:52] right back around and says when you
[55:55] become into the land that I shall bring
[55:57] you into the one thing that we we see
[56:01] it's a theme throughout God's Word is
[56:04] that what God what God has spoken he is
[56:09] going to fulfill it sometimes it looks
[56:12] like things can be so bleak or so dark
[56:15] but the Brennan would say it like this
[56:17] in the message of endtime evangelism he
[56:19] would say when it looks like he said the
[56:22] message is in question and everything is
[56:24] around he said that's when God steps in
[56:28] and that's the very thing because within
[56:31] at all yet God Himself is the one that
[56:35] has vindicated it and he've indicates
[56:38] that working in our life that this is
[56:41] not this is not the words of a man it is
[56:45] God's Word
[56:46] and when we we'd see that this call into
[56:51] the land here when we are come into the
[56:53] land and a life would offer up these
[56:56] offerings and every one of these
[56:58] offerings are to be of freewill offering
[57:02] and we have laid that in that it is
[57:04] something that is not mandated or
[57:07] required but it is from the heart of the
[57:11] believer and that's exactly where God's
[57:14] achievement was is to bring his life
[57:17] into the very life of the believer so it
[57:21] is no longer you or me that liveth but
[57:25] it's Christ that liveth in us it's no
[57:28] longer you it's not me trying to bring
[57:32] forth the word but it is Christ in us
[57:35] bringing forth his own word and this
[57:40] this when we take just for a moment here
[57:42] upon the burn offering and to see that
[57:46] this burnt offering as God would even
[57:50] make mention to Aaron and his sons and
[57:52] let it be known that there should not be
[57:54] an offering offered to the Lord that
[57:56] would have any blindness and he may many
[57:59] halt anything that would lack of the
[58:02] quality and that of which God had laid
[58:05] down in his word for that to be offered
[58:08] up which that in itself were an offering
[58:12] that would be free from blemish and
[58:14] fault it would speak of one thing and
[58:18] that's the perfection of Christ's own
[58:21] life it would it would also in the burnt
[58:25] offering it would display the the
[58:28] devotion this devotion as the son of God
[58:32] to the will of God we see that
[58:34] throughout Scriptures without taking
[58:36] time to go through that all the way from
[58:39] where we see clear in Psalms where they
[58:43] were David prophetically is under the
[58:46] spirit and begins to express our
[58:48] sacrifice and offerings now what is not
[58:50] but a body hast thou prepared for me
[58:54] God provided all of these means
[58:57] sacrifice and offerings so that his
[59:00] people so that he could have fellowship
[59:02] with em but they were all speaking of
[59:05] one all-sufficient sacrifice and that is
[59:09] his own life through and by the blood of
[59:13] the Lamb whereby we as his children
[59:16] would be gathered there under that blood
[59:19] and his life inside of us then here we
[59:23] are in that perfection in Christ and
[59:26] that was all that is God's achievement
[59:29] through that that his own life would be
[59:32] present in our life we see the life of
[59:35] Christ where he would say and declare I
[59:38] came not down from heaven to do my own
[59:40] will but I came to do the will of my
[59:42] father and he would say over and over
[59:44] that I had that I do not seek to please
[59:47] it was not pleasing himself but he
[59:50] sought to please the father his his
[59:53] desire everything was given to the will
[59:56] of the Father
[59:57] and so when we see that it was such a
[1:00:00] and we look at this within the burnt
[1:00:03] offering it it speaks of the devotion of
[1:00:06] Christ's own life he was devoted to
[1:00:09] where Paul could capture this by the
[1:00:12] Spirit of God and Paul would would write
[1:00:15] and say in Philippians 2:8 that being
[1:00:17] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[1:00:20] himself and became obedient unto death
[1:00:25] remember there was a battle in
[1:00:28] Gethsemane there was a battle and and
[1:00:31] not guess M&E was not the only battle
[1:00:35] but even throughout his whole journey
[1:00:38] when he was here brother Branham would
[1:00:40] use the terms in the church age book
[1:00:42] when he was constantly badgered by the
[1:00:45] religious of that day and they would
[1:00:48] what they are the very ones that they
[1:00:51] should have been receiving him they said
[1:00:54] that they were waiting on him but yet
[1:00:55] they withstood him and they badgered
[1:00:58] against him but yet within it all he
[1:01:01] would apply the word think of the
[1:01:03] pressures that he was under
[1:01:06] those pressures came in that manner to
[1:01:08] try to break the devotion that he would
[1:01:11] have to the will of the father when he
[1:01:14] was tempted after he pulled up out of
[1:01:16] the River Jordan he's what goes through
[1:01:18] three of successions of temptation what
[1:01:22] was every temptation about to try to
[1:01:24] break the devotion to the will of God
[1:01:27] and then we find the even from those
[1:01:30] temptations here he has brethren in John
[1:01:32] 7 no man has a gift like this keepeth
[1:01:35] this to himself but he shows it out
[1:01:36] openly
[1:01:37] it was the same devil that was on the
[1:01:40] mountain that now was using the voice of
[1:01:42] his brethren he recognized that what was
[1:01:45] it to do to try to break the devotion
[1:01:47] from the Word of God and so when we see
[1:01:50] that that's what happened back in Eden
[1:01:52] that's been always the battle throughout
[1:01:55] every all the way down through the
[1:01:57] Scriptures his Satan comes to try to
[1:01:59] break that devotion between that of
[1:02:02] between that of God and man he cannot
[1:02:06] break God's devotion yet you can't break
[1:02:08] God's devotion man's devotion can alter
[1:02:11] but God's devotion remains solid this is
[1:02:15] why it's important that we have that
[1:02:17] life of Christ within us that in the
[1:02:20] center in the midst of our life by the
[1:02:23] new birth then it is the devotion of his
[1:02:25] own life even when we lack there is
[1:02:29] perfect devotion see this is why the
[1:02:32] perfection Paul would call let us go on
[1:02:34] to perfection Paul would write about by
[1:02:36] one offering you are perfected forever
[1:02:39] what's involved dealing with Paul's
[1:02:40] dealing with a perfection where it comes
[1:02:43] down into the very depths of the soul
[1:02:45] where a person enters in to that
[1:02:48] relationship with God where they are
[1:02:51] walking by the perfection of Christ on
[1:02:54] life so it is a devotedness to the word
[1:02:57] think of this even when you and I have
[1:03:00] fallen short and made we've made a
[1:03:03] mistake what happens devotion in our
[1:03:06] life to the word Lord forgive me
[1:03:10] see it's devotion its devoted it devan
[1:03:13] that deverson that devotion doesn't
[1:03:15] lessened with our walk when we look at
[1:03:19] the life of Jesus Christ and every other
[1:03:22] will look at a few characters this
[1:03:24] morning and to see their lives the
[1:03:26] devotion does not lessen but the
[1:03:28] devotion becomes more greater and
[1:03:31] greater and greater as it comes to the
[1:03:35] achievement of the purpose that God has
[1:03:37] for their life it never lessened but
[1:03:39] every time the Spirit of God is present
[1:03:42] to move us from one Junction from one
[1:03:45] point to another in our life you know we
[1:03:47] don't have to wonder or just rest or
[1:03:52] rely upon ourselves Oh am i in the right
[1:03:55] spot or am I in the right place brother
[1:03:57] Branham would say it like this he says
[1:03:59] when the Spirit of God it moved there
[1:04:01] upon the Virgin and here here come forth
[1:04:05] the the you know the the the child and
[1:04:09] he said then and he then preparing here
[1:04:12] he is you know and and John is baptizing
[1:04:14] the Spirit of God moves upon him to go
[1:04:16] to the river Jordan and then he says he
[1:04:19] may just taking a quantum leap clear
[1:04:21] true true to the time of Calvary the
[1:04:24] Spirit of God moves upon his life to go
[1:04:27] to Calvary you see it's alway it's being
[1:04:29] led by the Holy Spirit it's it's not URI
[1:04:34] that holds the Junction's of time and
[1:04:37] Andy the transitions in the music sheet
[1:04:40] but it is Christ and he alerts us to
[1:04:44] those changes and through those temples
[1:04:46] in our life that's why our life Okin
[1:04:50] score what the world looks at as
[1:04:52] weakness the world looks at it as ah you
[1:04:56] weak but we recognize it's not by my
[1:04:59] strength not by power not by my but by
[1:05:04] my spirit saith the Lord this mountain
[1:05:06] shall be removed like David our
[1:05:09] testimony is the Lord is the strength of
[1:05:11] my life
[1:05:13] amen he is our strenght it is it is our
[1:05:18] strength is in the Lord so we find that
[1:05:21] all along in his life we've and seeing
[1:05:24] the very life of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:26] he was the sacrifice all along his life
[1:05:29] was a sacrificial life to think of even
[1:05:33] when he would want to go and and to
[1:05:37] minister to Lazarus before Lazarus was
[1:05:41] passing but yet he was held held in
[1:05:45] check by the will of God to wait
[1:05:48] it would speak of what God this right
[1:05:52] here what God did in Christ in and how
[1:05:57] that that was displayed that was the
[1:06:00] example that's the example of what every
[1:06:04] son and daughter of God is called to be
[1:06:08] now remember he said the son can do
[1:06:12] nothing but what he seeth the father
[1:06:14] doing he also said it's not me that
[1:06:17] doeth the works it's my father that
[1:06:19] dwelleth in me that doeth the works so
[1:06:24] today he brings it back to what that is
[1:06:27] bringing back to what was left in Eden
[1:06:29] where when the fall took place that holy
[1:06:32] image of God there was a separation now
[1:06:35] in Christ
[1:06:37] now comes the restoration of that holy
[1:06:40] image of Christ coming to where now it
[1:06:43] comes back into the life of the believer
[1:06:45] through where Paul could say it's Christ
[1:06:48] in you the hope of glory and Paul would
[1:06:51] call us and say you have borne the image
[1:06:54] of the earthly but now it is time that
[1:06:56] you bear the image of the heavenly Paul
[1:06:59] would come on to say into the Galatian
[1:07:01] Church with his labouring he says I
[1:07:03] travail together until now until Christ
[1:07:05] be formed in you is that right he would
[1:07:09] say in the book of Romans of how that of
[1:07:11] God's choosing and God
[1:07:16] desire for our life is that we would be
[1:07:18] conformed to the image of his dear son
[1:07:22] not that we would wear and we believe we
[1:07:24] understand this it's not about wearing a
[1:07:26] long robe or having the hair or having
[1:07:29] it's not about that it's not in his
[1:07:31] physical image but it's that our souls
[1:07:33] match the spiritual image of Jesus
[1:07:36] Christ and that's a sovereign work of
[1:07:39] Almighty God amen
[1:07:42] we that's is why the Bible can clearly
[1:07:45] say as Paul would tell us in Ephesians
[1:07:47] 2:10 that we have been created in Christ
[1:07:51] Jesus we are his workmanship we've been
[1:07:55] created unto good works ordained for
[1:08:00] that so here there's a devotion and
[1:08:04] through this devotion of his life it's
[1:08:07] to bring us in harmony with the Word of
[1:08:11] God there's one thing that has just soul
[1:08:15] I want you to ket I want you to catch
[1:08:17] this it's not just the Hutt's not just
[1:08:21] having the Holy Spirit here in our midst
[1:08:24] it's to have the leadership of the Holy
[1:08:26] Spirit
[1:08:30] that's what the message of the hour was
[1:08:34] sent to bring into our midst
[1:08:38] many churches then you'll find where
[1:08:41] they're the Holy Spirit falling but
[1:08:43] there's a difference the leadership of
[1:08:46] the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth
[1:08:48] that has come to direct us into the word
[1:08:54] to where that our lives our lives that
[1:08:58] are founded solidly on the Word of God
[1:09:00] our experience like Paul when Paul meant
[1:09:04] that pillar of fire he went and he
[1:09:07] evaluated where is his life at what he
[1:09:10] met Paul never jumped up and started
[1:09:12] running
[1:09:12] he went for three years and studied and
[1:09:14] seeing what happened does it match the
[1:09:17] scripture that's why I say our life and
[1:09:19] a real experience of God it doesn't take
[1:09:22] us out of the word it puts us in the
[1:09:24] word because it is the word inside of us
[1:09:28] so it's a devotion of his life working
[1:09:32] through us God is devoted to his word we
[1:09:37] can look clear from the beginning we
[1:09:38] could spend much time with that even
[1:09:41] when the fell the fall had taken place
[1:09:44] God is devoted to his word
[1:09:47] no matter of all of the failures that
[1:09:50] have been when we see things down
[1:09:53] through of the Scriptures you can see
[1:09:55] God's determination look Jacob look in
[1:09:58] Jacobs life brother Ben would say it
[1:10:01] like this he said anybody that reads
[1:10:03] Jacobs life you cannot read Jacobs life
[1:10:05] and not see and believe in the grace of
[1:10:07] God Jacobs had his ups and downs and
[1:10:11] things and even after Jacob was changed
[1:10:14] and that mystery of Israel and his life
[1:10:16] becomes expressed you'll find times in
[1:10:19] his life where it'll say and Jacob said
[1:10:21] and then you'll find times where it says
[1:10:24] and then Israel why because Israel has
[1:10:26] to bring in subjection Jacob
[1:10:31] but when it came time for the rapture it
[1:10:33] never said that Joseph sent down the
[1:10:35] wagons for Jacob has said has sent their
[1:10:37] wagons down for Israel and Israel got on
[1:10:40] it's character that God is coming to
[1:10:42] rapture that's the mystery that within
[1:10:46] this listen this this is a product of a
[1:10:51] lack of devotion but this in here this
[1:10:54] new birth comes by the devotion of
[1:10:57] Almighty God that's why this right here
[1:11:00] is a constant reigning over and bringing
[1:11:03] it in subjection because the flesh is
[1:11:06] weak the Spirit is willing but the flesh
[1:11:07] is weak but thanks be to God that
[1:11:10] there's a there's a greater devotion on
[1:11:13] the inside a devoted at the greater
[1:11:16] devotion and the Spirit of God dealing
[1:11:19] with our heart will stir even the
[1:11:21] devotion up in a life listen they take
[1:11:24] you know it takes a devotion before God
[1:11:26] comes and fully sets down on the throne
[1:11:29] of your heart it takes a devotion little
[1:11:32] by little by little but that's all him
[1:11:35] the Lord that's working in your life all
[1:11:38] along you know what he's doing he is
[1:11:40] preparing his own temple when he said a
[1:11:43] body has not prepared me you realize
[1:11:45] it's not asking you he gives you what's
[1:11:48] needed
[1:11:49] so he's preparing his own way the
[1:11:56] devotion of his life I think God for
[1:12:00] that the Bible would say it like this
[1:12:05] it would say if ye then be risen with
[1:12:09] Christ seek those things which are above
[1:12:11] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:12:14] of God set your affection on things
[1:12:18] above not on things on the earth for ye
[1:12:22] are dead and your life is hid with
[1:12:26] Christ in God when Christ who is our
[1:12:31] life shall appear then shall you also
[1:12:35] appear with him in glory is that your
[1:12:38] testimony he's my life the dis every
[1:12:43] decision that is to be made it's made
[1:12:45] with him in the center if there's a
[1:12:50] decision to be made and it doesn't
[1:12:52] retain Christ in the center of all
[1:12:54] things then that very thing if it's
[1:12:57] seeking to take him out of the centre
[1:12:59] then it's not of God and it may listen
[1:13:02] to me now it may not be necessarily that
[1:13:04] that it in itself is wrong it's just
[1:13:07] when it comes down personally in our
[1:13:09] life in our walk with the Lord because
[1:13:12] our desire is is that we that everything
[1:13:15] in our life is a desire is to reflect
[1:13:19] Jesus Christ set our affections our
[1:13:23] hearts our minds and this is why Paul
[1:13:25] would would come in in in Romans 12:1
[1:13:29] and he would say I beseech you therefore
[1:13:32] brethren by the mercies of God that ye
[1:13:36] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:13:41] notice giving over your bodies holy
[1:13:45] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:13:47] reasonable service and be not conformed
[1:13:51] to this world but be you transformed by
[1:13:54] the renewing of your mind that ye may
[1:13:57] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:14:00] and perfect will of God
[1:14:03] what Paul is dealing with notice this is
[1:14:06] your reasonable service this is all you
[1:14:08] can do this is all I can do is do what
[1:14:11] is to give of ourselves to give of
[1:14:15] ourselves to the Lord when God has
[1:14:18] spoken is to present ourselves to him
[1:14:21] this like itll as and Paul would use
[1:14:24] this this term in the scripture your
[1:14:25] reasonable service it would be that of
[1:14:28] like like a sacrifice that is being
[1:14:31] offered it's being presented it's it's
[1:14:34] being given to be offered up this is our
[1:14:37] reasonable service
[1:14:38] it's a surrendering of our own life a
[1:14:42] surrendering of our own will and how
[1:14:45] many of you know that surrendering of
[1:14:47] our own will it's ongoing it's not just
[1:14:51] something that just it just it just
[1:14:53] begins at an altar or begins when you
[1:14:55] accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your
[1:14:58] Savior note that that's surrendering it
[1:15:00] continues it's six or enduring and it's
[1:15:03] it's seeking after his will it's keeping
[1:15:06] - it's staying and surrender to him and
[1:15:09] this is where Paul just to kind of
[1:15:13] direct this here Paul is actually right
[1:15:17] here what he's Paul would be tying
[1:15:19] together Paul is reaching back into the
[1:15:23] Old Testament into Leviticus eight we're
[1:15:25] in that when the priests themselves were
[1:15:28] to enter into service they had to
[1:15:32] present themselves before at the door
[1:15:36] before Moses and Moses being the Prophet
[1:15:41] would wash them and anoint them and they
[1:15:45] would then come into service the only
[1:15:48] way a life can come fully into this
[1:15:51] place of service is to be washed by the
[1:15:56] revealed word of the hour amen you can't
[1:16:01] bypass it and say well I'm gonna bypass
[1:16:04] it you can't there's get on the ark when
[1:16:07] the person said well do you have to know
[1:16:09] Noah to get on the ark you're not gonna
[1:16:11] get on the ark without walking by Noah
[1:16:14] you can't get on the ark without walking
[1:16:17] by Noah because first of all hock
[1:16:20] achieve
[1:16:20] how could there even be anything about
[1:16:22] an ark that one that itself was a
[1:16:24] manifestation of the message God gave
[1:16:27] Noah what God spoke to Noah was
[1:16:32] invisible the word was invisible but
[1:16:34] then that word in Noah's heart it became
[1:16:37] visible it became what it became from
[1:16:41] word to a dwelling place it became from
[1:16:45] word to a place of safety a place where
[1:16:48] we could abide and dwell a man to be
[1:16:52] free from judgment hallelujah it's it's
[1:16:57] the grace of God so you hear coming into
[1:17:00] service you're coming into service and
[1:17:03] the word washes you the word anoint you
[1:17:07] for service and this is why that John
[1:17:10] could say in first John to 20 year from
[1:17:17] the Holy One and you know all things
[1:17:20] that unction is it speaks of that that
[1:17:24] anointing that is put upon you as a
[1:17:26] priest of God you realize that God has
[1:17:30] dealt with your life our life there's
[1:17:32] almost there's a two-fold part of our
[1:17:34] life we are kings and priests kings in
[1:17:38] that there is a reigning over sin over
[1:17:41] flesh over the world over the devil we
[1:17:44] are spiritual kings right now reigning
[1:17:47] with Christ right and we are also
[1:17:51] priests unto God we are were priests
[1:17:55] we're in that our lives are not our own
[1:17:59] our lives are not to be lived or not
[1:18:03] lived to ourselves but our lives are a
[1:18:05] sweet-smelling savour unto the Lord
[1:18:09] how could it be how could it be a sweet
[1:18:11] smelling savor remember the scripture
[1:18:13] said you must offer by fire but it
[1:18:16] cannot be by just any fire it must be by
[1:18:19] the original fire and that life that's
[1:18:23] offered up the life that's surrendered
[1:18:25] you know think of this this life as we
[1:18:27] said it continues to unfold decisions
[1:18:30] that we have to make you know you know
[1:18:33] what I'm saying
[1:18:34] decisions we have to make sometimes
[1:18:36] decisions that listen you're tested to
[1:18:39] go to your reasoning your tenured our
[1:18:44] devotion is tested by reasoning that's
[1:18:48] where Satan came to Eve in the beginning
[1:18:50] is by reasoning this is why Paul would
[1:18:54] come on speaking of the devotion and say
[1:18:56] cast down imaginations and bringing into
[1:19:00] captivity every thought into the
[1:19:03] obedience of Christ with holding that
[1:19:05] devotion how how can we do that let's
[1:19:09] just be let's just be real here are we
[1:19:13] are we are trusting in that devotion of
[1:19:16] his life inside of us is that right but
[1:19:20] remember we've got to stay in contact
[1:19:23] with that life inside of us and what I
[1:19:26] mean is is that we're as feeding on the
[1:19:29] word praying and it brings us to a place
[1:19:32] to where we be we are more sensitive and
[1:19:36] giving the inner man the right-of-way
[1:19:40] instead of taking it away from him we
[1:19:43] want to give the inner man the right
[1:19:44] away because we know when we make
[1:19:48] decisions based on our reasonings and
[1:19:50] listen God's given us a reasoning is
[1:19:53] reasoning wrong know when it's with the
[1:19:55] Word of God but when reasoning is
[1:19:57] against the Word of God it's error is
[1:20:00] that right so here so we need we need
[1:20:04] that of the grace of God and say the
[1:20:06] Lord in decisions and things that are
[1:20:09] all around us remember even when brother
[1:20:12] Branham was going to make the decision
[1:20:15] to go up
[1:20:16] and become a trapper and and you know
[1:20:19] you always want to do that and so forth
[1:20:20] and and and and most of you know this
[1:20:23] here God put the decision before him if
[1:20:25] you go your wife's gonna leave you this
[1:20:30] is what you're gonna be you'll be a bum
[1:20:34] but if you want to do it go do it see
[1:20:37] God didn't say no please don't do it no
[1:20:39] see what God is showing God's showing
[1:20:41] sonship that's what God showing maturity
[1:20:46] does not you know what I think of it as
[1:20:48] we mike remember you know when I was you
[1:20:51] know younger and I know I'm pretty young
[1:20:53] but you know you were wanting to the man
[1:20:56] you wanted certain decisions you wanted
[1:20:57] to make man I can't wait to make this
[1:20:59] decision now there's things that I wish
[1:21:00] I could say here you take the decision
[1:21:02] here you take the decision you know you
[1:21:04] know what I'm saying because the
[1:21:05] decisions they come there is great
[1:21:08] responsibility with maturity comes
[1:21:13] greater responsibility comes greater
[1:21:17] decisions this is why the this is why
[1:21:20] this is why the greater the maturity in
[1:21:24] our life is shown by us recognizing our
[1:21:29] weakness and our need so much more for
[1:21:33] him that's maturing that's maturing this
[1:21:40] is part of that unction that's upon our
[1:21:42] lives that anointing go verse 27 it says
[1:21:48] the anointing what you've received of
[1:21:51] him abideth in you and you need not that
[1:21:56] any man teach you but as the same
[1:21:59] anointing teacheth you of all things and
[1:22:02] is truth and there's no lie even as it
[1:22:05] had taught you ye shall abide in
[1:22:11] this the Spirit of Truth this is what is
[1:22:14] being spoken this is what John is
[1:22:17] talking about the Spirit of Truth the
[1:22:19] Holy Ghost it upon our life will direct
[1:22:23] our lives to bear the fruit of God in
[1:22:28] the season that we are in it brings its
[1:22:34] God bringing it all around it's the
[1:22:35] Spirit of Truth listen to me it's the
[1:22:39] Spirit of Truth that reveals the Word of
[1:22:43] God to our hearts this scripture here
[1:22:46] brother Branham would take this
[1:22:47] scripture and he says now if you read
[1:22:49] this scripture and you say oh I don't
[1:22:51] need it a preacher the other branch that
[1:22:53] see you just got the wrong idea about
[1:22:54] the scripture he said because why would
[1:22:57] the same God say this here and say that
[1:23:00] they're not needed and then played a
[1:23:02] play some in the church over here see
[1:23:04] it's a misunderstanding not by God but
[1:23:07] by a person because the one thing about
[1:23:10] it is is that the reality of the God
[1:23:12] when the spirit of truth comes in our
[1:23:14] life it does not make us independent it
[1:23:17] makes us reliant upon him because the
[1:23:21] sons of God are led by the Spirit of God
[1:23:24] that is that is the direction of a of a
[1:23:27] son of God when they asked Jesus why are
[1:23:30] you here this person on the Sabbath day
[1:23:31] you know he got confronted with that
[1:23:33] many times I mean these people are have
[1:23:35] been rejoicing but instead they're
[1:23:37] badgering him and in John 5 jesus said
[1:23:40] the father workers and I work as
[1:23:41] hitherto what what do you mean he says
[1:23:45] the son can do nothing but what he see
[1:23:47] the father doing Jesus was walking in
[1:23:51] this land
[1:23:52] of our habitation he was living in this
[1:23:57] place because what we read in numbers 15
[1:23:59] is of a natural land but Jesus here came
[1:24:02] and lived within this spiritual land of
[1:24:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:24:08] word to bring that evidence to show to
[1:24:10] you and I that this is a real land that
[1:24:13] you and I then could come and we could
[1:24:15] dwell within this land it was it was a
[1:24:19] place he was they were looking at they
[1:24:22] knew the word by letter jesus knew the
[1:24:25] word of my vision they could read it but
[1:24:29] there that they didn't have any
[1:24:30] connection with the author they knew it
[1:24:33] but no connection with life so to them
[1:24:36] what should have been life became death
[1:24:42] the very word that that's net that held
[1:24:45] within it the promise of life became
[1:24:47] death to them why because here in the
[1:24:51] midst of that they they were not in a
[1:24:54] place to receive from God I tell you
[1:24:59] it's a blessed thing to have your eyes
[1:25:00] open it's a blessed thing because it's
[1:25:06] the Spirit of Truth that reveals the
[1:25:07] Word of God to our hearts it changes it
[1:25:11] changes it from letter to spirit it
[1:25:17] changes it from letter to spirit from
[1:25:20] word to vision to manifestation it's the
[1:25:24] Spirit of God that moves that wants you
[1:25:29] to
[1:25:31] listen to this brother branham would put
[1:25:34] this in in the message look and there's
[1:25:38] a lot that is being said within this
[1:25:40] part here but he begins to express to us
[1:25:45] he says of how when Jesus came he wasn't
[1:25:49] just a man he wasn't just the third
[1:25:51] person of the Trinity he was God he was
[1:25:55] God himself he was Emmanuel and were
[1:25:58] taught in the Bible that were saved by
[1:26:01] the blood of God when God Himself became
[1:26:04] one of us he he changed his tent he came
[1:26:08] down condon sending from glory and
[1:26:12] became a man
[1:26:13] therefore born without sex he created
[1:26:17] himself a body that he lived in himself
[1:26:22] Emmanuel God represented with us the
[1:26:26] Word made flesh among us and lived with
[1:26:30] us the Word made flesh among us and
[1:26:35] lived with us to redeem many sons back
[1:26:39] to God
[1:26:40] through the shedding of this blood the
[1:26:43] body sure was Christ
[1:26:45] it was the Anointed One and if Christ
[1:26:48] means The Anointed One and he's the same
[1:26:51] yesterday today and forever he is the
[1:26:54] word then the word is the anointing if
[1:26:58] ye abide in me and my word abide in you
[1:27:03] then say what you will it's the word of
[1:27:07] god the anointed word that's what does
[1:27:12] it the word made flesh hear God coming
[1:27:18] down and it's that same word that was
[1:27:21] veiled that took upon that veil it
[1:27:23] created that veil and it lived behind
[1:27:26] that veil God's own life here the Holy
[1:27:29] Ghost and that same word now coming in
[1:27:34] your life in my life the anointing upon
[1:27:37] our life is the word
[1:27:39] it's the word anointing upon our life
[1:27:44] hallelujah the same anointing that was
[1:27:48] upon the life of the Lord Jesus for
[1:27:50] remember he asked a question can you be
[1:27:53] baptized with the baptism that I am
[1:27:55] baptized with yes Lord he said surely
[1:27:58] you shall be we have received that we've
[1:28:02] not received a different garment when
[1:28:05] Elijah went off the scene he threw back
[1:28:07] his mantle when the Lord Jesus was
[1:28:10] sended on high he sent back the Holy
[1:28:12] Ghost is that right when the prodigal
[1:28:16] came home the servants went to get the
[1:28:18] best robe which is the father's role he
[1:28:21] was or doing adorned in the father's
[1:28:23] robe his life that word anointing upon
[1:28:26] our life so then that word anointing
[1:28:29] upon our life how is that becoming in
[1:28:32] our life it is the manifestation in our
[1:28:37] life that we have been brought under the
[1:28:40] blood cell we are safe in him I want you
[1:28:47] to think of this brother Branham would
[1:28:49] take a great deal of time laying this in
[1:28:53] and the message look and he's directing
[1:28:56] the focus of the people because what has
[1:28:59] been projected as what they need to be
[1:29:02] looking at it is not producing what
[1:29:05] needs to be produced in the lives of the
[1:29:08] people but God listen a prophet is a
[1:29:11] seer its eyes that's provided to the
[1:29:15] body to be able to take things that are
[1:29:17] out of line and blurry and be able to
[1:29:20] line it up so the church that was off
[1:29:23] target and off mark now it hits the mark
[1:29:26] who's working is this it's God who has
[1:29:30] devoted to his word for he said behold I
[1:29:33] will send unto you Elijah the Prophet
[1:29:35] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:29:37] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:29:39] children back to the faith of the
[1:29:41] fathers it was God devoted to his word
[1:29:43] God sent the message to you and I
[1:29:46] because God is devoted to the promise of
[1:29:48] his word
[1:29:50] amen this message this message is an
[1:29:53] evidence of God's undying devotion and
[1:30:02] this message inside of you and I it is
[1:30:05] Christ that undying devotion is devoted
[1:30:10] to the will of God what was in the groom
[1:30:13] is now present in the bride that same
[1:30:18] devotion of life hallelujah who's done
[1:30:22] it he has is the anointing of the word
[1:30:26] upon our life a prophet has come in this
[1:30:30] generation and there is a word that has
[1:30:33] been given to this generation and the
[1:30:38] people of God have come under that word
[1:30:40] like Peter said humble yourselves under
[1:30:42] the mighty hand of God it was out of the
[1:30:45] right hand seven stars humble yourself
[1:30:48] under the mighty hand of God and he
[1:30:50] shall exalt you in due time hallelujah I
[1:30:57] almost forget that I'm a little we've
[1:31:03] been brought under the revealed Word of
[1:31:05] the hour here listen like Samuel came
[1:31:09] and anointed David you remember Saul was
[1:31:13] rejected and God told Samuel go fill
[1:31:17] your horn with oil and I'll tell you
[1:31:19] where to go where do I go you go up to
[1:31:22] you go up to Jesse well if I go up there
[1:31:24] you know Saul's gonna kill me but he
[1:31:26] says here hide it in the sacrifice call
[1:31:32] him to call him to the sacrifice hide it
[1:31:36] in the sacrifice and they would come to
[1:31:39] this place what was it what was what was
[1:31:42] Samuel going to David with he was going
[1:31:44] to David with the word and the word was
[1:31:47] going to be poured out upon the head of
[1:31:50] David so David would be anointed with
[1:31:53] the word let me tell you something that
[1:31:55] word anointing it came from Almighty God
[1:31:58] God was anointing David as king let me
[1:32:02] tell you something
[1:32:03] inside of the anointing of this word it
[1:32:05] packs within it
[1:32:06] royal DNA yet box within it great-great
[1:32:12] transforming power you let the word just
[1:32:16] be poured upon your life and has the
[1:32:19] power to transform your life hallelujah
[1:32:23] in men in God through His Prophet in
[1:32:27] this generation has poured that
[1:32:29] anointing of the word upon our lives
[1:32:32] will not been anointed for another age
[1:32:35] were anointed for rapture hallelujah
[1:32:41] we're not anointed for defeat were
[1:32:44] anointed in victory we're one rejected
[1:32:50] and disobedience and counted things
[1:32:52] lightly like Saul but here David David
[1:32:55] Rises one who had not have been chosen
[1:32:57] passed over even the Prophet was gonna
[1:33:00] pass him over showing that this choice
[1:33:04] was not of man hallelujah the Prophet is
[1:33:12] off that he has either already given his
[1:33:15] message but God has seen fit to it when
[1:33:18] that message was given in this
[1:33:20] generation to be brought to you and I he
[1:33:22] knew who would be here and that word
[1:33:25] would find its mark because the
[1:33:29] anointing of the word has been poured
[1:33:32] out and where there are seeds of God to
[1:33:35] absorb that water they change it brings
[1:33:43] a new creation it brings forth a son and
[1:33:48] daughter of God hallelujah
[1:33:53] it's that revelation that's been placed
[1:33:56] in our hearts by the love of God breaks
[1:34:01] my heart to see people walk away just
[1:34:04] turn their back upon it and they re
[1:34:06] reason it out but that's if that's where
[1:34:08] if that's where they want to go they can
[1:34:10] go ahead and go we can disagree I'm not
[1:34:15] going to be disagreeable I'll disagree
[1:34:17] with you but it but when it comes to
[1:34:19] standing on this word this word is Jesus
[1:34:24] Christ
[1:34:24] [Applause]
[1:34:31] you can't debate this and to say that
[1:34:35] this is Error and this is that you come
[1:34:37] too late too late too late too late you
[1:34:44] see this is why this is why listen I
[1:34:46] hope you hear it you see and maybe the
[1:34:49] ponder this talk this is why it has been
[1:34:52] laid in soul I think before I was ever
[1:34:54] pastor here it was laid in and not just
[1:34:57] here not not drawing lines to that but
[1:34:59] what the Prophet would tell us in 65
[1:35:03] even in the message of rapture he's
[1:35:05] drawing the focus of what this message
[1:35:08] is all about it is the revelation of
[1:35:11] Jesus Christ that has come to get a
[1:35:14] people ready for rapture without this
[1:35:18] message there is no rapture that is the
[1:35:24] promise of God's Word
[1:35:26] outside of its tribulation bound are you
[1:35:31] with me this is the Living bread of life
[1:35:34] that has come down to you and I of a
[1:35:38] perishing people we were perishing might
[1:35:42] have been going to church but perishing
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:45] sought for life but perishing but God
[1:35:50] who is rich in mercy
[1:35:54] hallelujah God who is rich in mercy he
[1:36:00] broke the bread of life to you and I you
[1:36:06] might have been sitting around it for
[1:36:08] years like me but then he comes back
[1:36:10] your way and it's not no longer just
[1:36:12] truth to you but you see I'm a part of
[1:36:15] this I'm a part of this it's a part of
[1:36:19] me what is that the bread of life it's
[1:36:23] the bread of life the anointing of the
[1:36:27] word has been poured upon your life
[1:36:31] that's why you see things differently
[1:36:34] you don't read the Bible just as words
[1:36:36] anymore the message isn't just words
[1:36:39] anymore you're not just listening to a
[1:36:41] prophets voice but you're hearing
[1:36:43] directly from the throne of God well
[1:36:49] done that the anointing of the word
[1:36:51] you'll never be the same
[1:37:00] the veil has been lifted from our hearts
[1:37:05] glory be to God how did that come about
[1:37:08] God devoted to his word and he said I
[1:37:12] have a bride without spot wrinkle
[1:37:14] blemish or any such thing what is
[1:37:17] bringing that about Christ's own
[1:37:19] devotion he's devoted to his word and in
[1:37:24] the midst of our life when we may be
[1:37:26] brother Carlos we we would say oh I
[1:37:27] don't know I I don't know but here in
[1:37:30] our life it's that rises up and says be
[1:37:33] in the house of God beyond our
[1:37:36] discouragement it don't feel like prama
[1:37:40] to say I need to talk to the Lord what
[1:37:41] is it it's the greater devotion of his
[1:37:45] life on the inside it's prevailing use
[1:37:49] one does realize that's why the Prophet
[1:37:51] said there is such prevailing power with
[1:37:54] revelation it's not this it's prevailing
[1:37:58] power it would be easier to stop the Sun
[1:38:04] than to stop the revelation in your
[1:38:06] heart it's prevailing power it can't be
[1:38:15] stopped that's why as I come back to
[1:38:17] this place this is why the message
[1:38:30] it doesn't mean I'm gonna be long
[1:38:39] it's more
[1:38:41] than just signs and wonders God
[1:38:45] vindicated this message the sign of the
[1:38:50] Messiah
[1:38:51] it's not just well this was just like
[1:38:54] this man's amiss no sir there's been a
[1:38:58] lot of other men that had a lot of other
[1:39:00] gifts and things like that thank God for
[1:39:02] that we don't despise that at all that's
[1:39:04] all part of the body but there's only
[1:39:06] one messenger to an age are you with me
[1:39:11] there's only one that has that sign and
[1:39:15] the word after the sign what is the
[1:39:20] voice of the sign
[1:39:34] that was free
[1:39:42] it's by faith can you say Amen the
[1:39:47] anointing of the word in our hearts our
[1:39:49] lives it brings us into John 5:19 this
[1:39:51] harmony it brings us into John 14:12 the
[1:39:55] works that I do shall you do also even
[1:39:59] where Jesus remember he would say if
[1:40:00] you're doubting me believe me for the
[1:40:02] very works sake he went what was he
[1:40:05] doing brother Branham would tell us like
[1:40:06] this he said in this I tyrant Age he
[1:40:09] said what Jesus was pointing them to is
[1:40:11] that the works that were made manifest
[1:40:13] through his life should inspire faith in
[1:40:17] him because the works tell what's on the
[1:40:22] inside is that right a sheep does not
[1:40:27] manufacture wool it bears right so the
[1:40:36] Bible tells us here let's hone this in
[1:40:39] on faith in our life and faith now faith
[1:40:46] is the substance of things hoped for the
[1:40:49] evidence of things not seen for by it
[1:40:54] the elders obtained a good report
[1:40:56] through faith we understand that the
[1:41:00] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[1:41:04] that things which are seen were not made
[1:41:06] of things which do appear for we walk by
[1:41:10] faith and not by sight
[1:41:17] hallelujah now James I want to go to
[1:41:21] James chapter 2 verse 14 and looking at
[1:41:24] this of faith because we we understand
[1:41:26] that faith faith is a divine revelation
[1:41:32] you a person you can't get anything
[1:41:36] listen to me now no matter where you're
[1:41:38] at
[1:41:38] maybe you're just in the beginnings of
[1:41:40] your journey maybe you haven't even
[1:41:41] started but the Bible is is very clear
[1:41:45] that who whosoever cometh to God must
[1:41:49] first believe that he is and that he is
[1:41:55] a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:41:58] Him
[1:42:00] you must believe the greatest thing the
[1:42:06] greatest thing is to get your eyes off
[1:42:08] of yourself and a full surrendering of
[1:42:13] your heart he's the one to remedy that I
[1:42:18] I think I just read a statement here
[1:42:20] just yes just yeah yesterday and brother
[1:42:24] Branham was dealing in the service with
[1:42:26] with the people and he says that same
[1:42:29] spirit of God that has brought the
[1:42:31] repentance or the Pittman's penton's in
[1:42:34] your heart and conviction of where you
[1:42:36] have confessed your sins now he said may
[1:42:40] that same spirit of God direct your life
[1:42:43] for you in your life to bring a complete
[1:42:46] sanctifying see the same working now the
[1:42:50] Holy Spirit now it move is working
[1:42:52] within that life but it requires faith
[1:42:55] just simple what does what does faith
[1:42:57] mean faith doesn't mean you can explain
[1:42:59] it matter of fact that is not faith at
[1:43:02] all you and I have had like we talked
[1:43:05] about on Thursday night and ministering
[1:43:07] on that of patience if we got it figured
[1:43:09] out it's no longer faith but faith is
[1:43:13] just it is it is
[1:43:18] so here at James to verse 14 what does
[1:43:28] it profit my brethren though a man say
[1:43:32] he hath faith and hath not works can
[1:43:35] faith save him what is a good question
[1:43:38] in it can't faith save him please you
[1:43:43] say well you know immediately I go to
[1:43:46] the scripture in Ephesians 2
[1:43:47] you know it's by grace through faith and
[1:43:49] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:43:51] and you know it's by faith well that we
[1:43:54] are saved by faith is that right
[1:43:57] but remember salvation when faith itself
[1:44:02] starts within a work salvation starts
[1:44:05] there's got to be works that follow the
[1:44:07] testify of what has been done in your
[1:44:10] life is that right a person is not going
[1:44:14] to surrender their life and then then
[1:44:15] then you keep quiet if you keep quiet
[1:44:17] it's because you don't believe but the
[1:44:20] very thing is when you give your heart
[1:44:22] in your life to God then you're to
[1:44:23] testify
[1:44:24] oh brother Sammy you don't know I still
[1:44:27] have so many different things in my life
[1:44:29] that's you're testifying about I am
[1:44:31] saved and you watch that confession it
[1:44:37] worketh righteousness are you with me
[1:44:43] and you confess that can faith save him
[1:44:48] now here James brings along if a
[1:44:51] brother-sister be naked and destitute of
[1:44:53] daily food and one of you say unto them
[1:44:55] depart in peace be you warmed and filled
[1:44:59] notwithstanding you give them not those
[1:45:01] things which are needful to the body
[1:45:03] what does it profit even so watch out
[1:45:08] James just this continues to unfold even
[1:45:10] so faith if it hath not works is dead
[1:45:16] being alone yay a man may say thou has
[1:45:21] faith and I have works show me thy faith
[1:45:25] without thy words show me your faith
[1:45:30] without thy works and I will show thee
[1:45:32] my faith by my works
[1:45:38] hmm
[1:45:40] now believe us look at this vow believe
[1:45:42] is that there is one God I'll do as well
[1:45:45] The Devil's also believe and tremble but
[1:45:52] will vow to are in other words put some
[1:45:54] action to your believing
[1:45:57] put some legs on your believing put some
[1:46:02] hands on your believing not just saying
[1:46:06] well I believe I mean there's a lot of
[1:46:07] people say well I don't understand I
[1:46:09] mean I believe listen
[1:46:11] belief we translate itself into action
[1:46:16] if you went to the doctor and they said
[1:46:20] you've got this and this and this and
[1:46:23] you're gonna die unless you get this
[1:46:25] taken care of and they have to you know
[1:46:28] you've got to sew your mouth shut or you
[1:46:29] have to do this stop eating this or do
[1:46:31] this or do that do you know what it you
[1:46:34] could walk out of the office you say
[1:46:35] yeah yeah I think it's got a good shot
[1:46:38] and you keep on doing the same things
[1:46:40] you've always done you would say you
[1:46:41] don't believe it
[1:46:42] but if the person believes it that's
[1:46:45] what they start making changes is that
[1:46:48] right do does everything change
[1:46:50] overnight some of you had to go through
[1:46:52] some of those things with certain
[1:46:53] dietary changes does everything change
[1:46:55] overnight no but a little by little by
[1:46:57] little by little change comes
[1:47:02] because why you believe and to believe
[1:47:06] and and listen to believe on what on
[1:47:10] what the doctor has said then look it
[1:47:12] begins to work out in your life what do
[1:47:15] people begin to see when you're at the
[1:47:17] restaurant they say what are you gonna
[1:47:18] have let me see here I'm gonna have no
[1:47:21] no red meat I'm gonna have the chicken
[1:47:22] I'm gonna have the vegetables and and
[1:47:24] this over here you know what people are
[1:47:26] seeing they're seeing a manifestation of
[1:47:29] a visit that you had privately with the
[1:47:32] doctor are you with me
[1:47:36] they don't add what they're what they're
[1:47:38] witnessing is the changes in the choices
[1:47:40] you're making it because you had a
[1:47:42] meeting with the doctor how much greater
[1:47:46] a meeting was god what comes out of that
[1:47:51] life there are things that change in
[1:47:55] that life based on that meeting verse 20
[1:48:04] but wilt thou o vain man
[1:48:07] that faith without works is dead was not
[1:48:11] Abraham our Father justified by works
[1:48:14] when he had offered Isaac his son upon
[1:48:18] the altar seest thou how faith wrought
[1:48:22] with his works and by works was faith
[1:48:24] made perfect rock complete and the
[1:48:29] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[1:48:31] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:48:33] unto him for righteousness and he was
[1:48:36] called the friend of God so he says you
[1:48:40] see then how that by works a man is
[1:48:42] justified and not by faith only skip
[1:48:49] down to verse 26 for as the body without
[1:48:51] the Spirit is dead so faith without
[1:48:53] works is dead also I've got these in
[1:48:58] their sister Tabitha but just let me
[1:49:00] refer to these next quotes I'm not going
[1:49:02] to read him for sake of time okay thank
[1:49:04] you this is where when we're reading
[1:49:08] here in the book of James we read over
[1:49:11] in the book of Romans and recognizing of
[1:49:14] how that Paul would write I believe it's
[1:49:18] in Rome Romans 4 he would write of how
[1:49:20] Paul he was not justified by Abraham was
[1:49:24] not justified by it was not in works but
[1:49:28] it was in faith it would seem like James
[1:49:31] and Paul are contradicting but they're
[1:49:37] not Paul is writing what God sees James
[1:49:44] is writing what man sees
[1:49:49] James is a real pastor he can only go
[1:49:52] about what he sees come on now because
[1:49:58] because when we when we where we're
[1:50:01] looking at it here you know here's Paul
[1:50:03] he's seeing this and this is this is the
[1:50:06] beauty this is the beauty of it then
[1:50:09] even in our life when our life has as
[1:50:11] when there's been some faltering listen
[1:50:13] to me God's faithfulness does not waver
[1:50:16] our faithfulness can waver are you with
[1:50:20] me God's faithfulness does not waver so
[1:50:24] in the midst of that what God is looking
[1:50:27] at in the midst of it God sees that
[1:50:30] faith in our life but everyone else and
[1:50:34] but see God's desire is how that that
[1:50:37] that would work out in our life this is
[1:50:41] why that a person that without faith say
[1:50:45] if the faith doesn't produce works works
[1:50:49] a life becomes well I'm not talking
[1:50:51] about it just to say I'm not talking
[1:50:54] about giving fruit baskets to the poor
[1:50:56] that's what I'm talking about I'm
[1:50:58] talking about righteousness I'm talking
[1:51:00] about in continuity with a word right if
[1:51:06] if the testimony does not follow that
[1:51:10] then it then there is a right to
[1:51:12] question that faith it's like a person
[1:51:17] says well I believe the message and they
[1:51:18] don't go to church I got a right to
[1:51:20] question that you don't want you don't
[1:51:24] walk within the truth I got to write the
[1:51:25] question that all that you don't see my
[1:51:27] heart no but I see your for I see the
[1:51:29] feet on the ground I see what you're
[1:51:32] doing are you with me
[1:51:35] I've been we can look and see that's why
[1:51:37] prison well you know you you can't judge
[1:51:40] my heart nobody's judging your heart but
[1:51:42] what we see is works are you with me we
[1:51:45] see his works or I love the Lord
[1:51:48] what if you love to remember what is in
[1:51:50] your heart will come out whatever's in
[1:51:54] here will come out
[1:51:57] so is it all God looks on the heart
[1:51:59] thank God for that
[1:52:00] he does look on the heart but remember
[1:52:02] be not deceived what is in the heart
[1:52:06] will come out through your life be sure
[1:52:10] you've got good seed on the inside and
[1:52:14] if there's been something that's been
[1:52:16] taking away and hindering that say Lord
[1:52:19] forgive me restore to me the joy of that
[1:52:22] salvation bring me Lord back in line
[1:52:26] because remember Abraham even in his
[1:52:29] journey was Abraham's life always if I
[1:52:33] could say it was Abraham's life perfect
[1:52:36] no no but the word of the Lord which
[1:52:44] Abraham took into his heart was perfect
[1:52:47] it was perfect and God would unfold that
[1:52:52] word in his time this is why it would
[1:52:56] require see wasn't Abraham's works works
[1:52:59] alone but it took the holy faith of God
[1:53:02] brother Ram would sit like this the holy
[1:53:03] faith of God to unite with the holy
[1:53:06] works of Abraham it was God's holy faith
[1:53:10] that was revealed to Abraham
[1:53:13] you catch this God's holy faith revealed
[1:53:16] to Abraham God's faith for the hour do
[1:53:21] you realize that here Abram his name was
[1:53:23] Abram but it was changed at Abraham God
[1:53:27] put his last name he put his name his
[1:53:33] life his upon Abraham's life he didn't
[1:53:38] just come to the end of it he came and
[1:53:40] came in the middle of Abraham's life
[1:53:45] you with me why because as brother madam
[1:53:49] would tell us he said Abraham was called
[1:53:53] of God to reproduce the faith of Elohim
[1:53:57] God's faith that God had in his word you
[1:54:00] believe God has faith in his word God's
[1:54:02] faith in his word has never changed and
[1:54:04] that same God now coming in the heart of
[1:54:08] Abraham and putting that in Abraham's
[1:54:10] life so who was it it was God in Abraham
[1:54:14] believing what God had said hallelujah
[1:54:18] that's a real child of Abraham Amen
[1:54:23] walking under the anointing of that word
[1:54:27] he received it and there are the holy
[1:54:30] works they they come forth from his life
[1:54:32] I made it pause on Abraham a moment I
[1:54:35] don't have much longer I just just want
[1:54:38] to drop these two points and we'll we'll
[1:54:40] close but don't be focused on the close
[1:54:43] he focused on this now
[1:54:49] the Bible talks about Enoch and in the
[1:54:54] book of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 5 it
[1:54:59] says by faith Enoch was translated then
[1:55:02] he should not see death and was not
[1:55:06] found because God had translated him
[1:55:13] you know how powerful that is even in
[1:55:16] listen that is what's going to take
[1:55:19] place with our bodies but what stay
[1:55:23] gonna take place with our bodies is
[1:55:25] what's already taking place with our
[1:55:27] soul we have been translated from death
[1:55:33] unto life the devil couldn't find us if
[1:55:37] he tried to to get where we are he'd
[1:55:41] have to come through the blood then he
[1:55:43] would be our brother we have been
[1:55:48] brought here at a new creation by the
[1:55:52] sovereignty of Almighty God the
[1:55:54] quickening power of God has translated
[1:55:57] us he delivered us as Paul said from the
[1:56:00] darkness and translated us into the
[1:56:02] kingdom of his dear son
[1:56:03] Enochs life Enoch lived this life this
[1:56:08] kind of a life that we lived the Bible
[1:56:11] says Enoch walked with God the last part
[1:56:14] of that right there says before his
[1:56:18] translation
[1:56:20] don't wait till you get down before your
[1:56:25] translation don't wait so one of these
[1:56:28] days I'm gonna get serious it's time to
[1:56:29] get serious now knowing say when I
[1:56:33] retire that's what I'm gonna get more
[1:56:35] dedicated you may not have time it's
[1:56:38] time to be dedicated right now and let
[1:56:40] me just tell you something
[1:56:41] you don't need to be retired to be
[1:56:43] dedicated come on somebody this word
[1:56:47] right here the word Enoch his name means
[1:56:50] dedicated and dedicated is a type of the
[1:56:55] seventh from Adam this seventh church
[1:56:58] age it's this this group of people the
[1:57:02] overcomers the true lady Wilson's that
[1:57:06] are the true over comers out of Lady
[1:57:08] ousia
[1:57:08] that are caught away it's a capping it's
[1:57:13] a Enoch
[1:57:15] dedicated lives you know that speaks of
[1:57:18] you'll be everything and there is
[1:57:20] everything that is turned loose against
[1:57:24] us in this hour every demon out of hell
[1:57:27] is turned loose the lid has been ripped
[1:57:30] off
[1:57:33] revelations 9 all the demon powers that
[1:57:37] are streaming out in this hour but Enoch
[1:57:42] he walked with God there wasn't a word
[1:57:47] that God asked from Enoch and Enoch was
[1:57:51] an obedient - you know why Enoch was
[1:57:55] dwelling dwelling in the quickening
[1:58:00] power of God he was dwelling in that
[1:58:03] place walking with God when the Bible
[1:58:06] said he walked with God see this is the
[1:58:11] evaluation that has to move into our
[1:58:15] life this is the call into this land is
[1:58:18] a life of complete devotion
[1:58:25] let me just stop there because I
[1:58:35] let's just stop there
[1:58:42] this is the call
[1:58:45] and I would say from our hearts here
[1:58:48] this morning
[1:58:51] this would be thank you this would be
[1:58:57] what madness this would be of the desire
[1:58:59] and I trusted the desire and every one
[1:59:04] of your hearts Lord I want to be devoted
[1:59:12] they really let in our life remember
[1:59:15] that devotion it comes by his own life
[1:59:18] but I wanted but and if that life if you
[1:59:22] are not a possessor of that life why not
[1:59:26] be devoted to that promise that belongs
[1:59:29] to you be devoted to that and if that
[1:59:34] life is there was in your life then it's
[1:59:39] like his brother banner would make a
[1:59:41] statement I think it's in 65
[1:59:45] it just was reading in here the other
[1:59:47] day he says you turn loose of everything
[1:59:52] turn loose of earthing brother brems his
[1:59:54] job and everything else you say you
[1:59:56] saying to quit my job what brother bran
[1:59:57] was saying and that whole statement is
[2:00:00] turn loose of everything that would be
[2:00:03] hindering you or holding you back let
[2:00:07] the Holy Spirit let me make an
[2:00:09] evaluation because listen we can either
[2:00:11] press down that inner man or we can
[2:00:14] allow the inner man to have his way we
[2:00:18] want to let that inner man have his way
[2:00:20] because it will always be directed into
[2:00:23] the word of the Lord
[2:00:25] let's bow his
[2:00:33] I mean I'd like to be remembered in
[2:00:34] prayer this morning god bless your hands
[2:00:40] amen
[2:00:42] Lord Jesus
[2:00:45] you certainly see Lord you know your God
[2:00:49] the depths of our hearts
[2:00:52] Lord as Enoch walked he had a he had a
[2:00:58] testimony before he was translated that
[2:01:00] he pleased you dear God if there's one
[2:01:05] here this morning
[2:01:07] that doesn't have and has not received
[2:01:11] of that life Lord may they receive that
[2:01:16] this morning may they not rest until
[2:01:19] Lord God that they've received that life
[2:01:22] may be one who hasn't made a start Lord
[2:01:25] that God may they faith or may they make
[2:01:27] that start this morning Lord give
[2:01:31] themselves to the word
[2:01:34] 'lord friend
[2:01:36] lives Lord the rest of the lives Lord it
[2:01:41] would be here lives that God that you
[2:01:45] you've placed Lord your life within and
[2:01:49] here we are
[2:01:49] but dwelling within you Lord Oh God
[2:01:55] help us like Paul would admonish us to
[2:01:58] seek those things that are above God may
[2:02:02] there be such an evaluation that comes
[2:02:04] across our life because walking through
[2:02:07] this land as you spoke to us here in
[2:02:10] numbers 15 walking through this land
[2:02:12] it's a land of devotion because we are
[2:02:16] born into this land by the devotion of
[2:02:19] God Lord a devoted life self-sacrificing
[2:02:25] life lord help us our our hands are up
[2:02:30] Oh God help us Lord sacrificing our own
[2:02:35] will Lord sacrificing our own thoughts
[2:02:38] Lord sacrificing our own leadings
[2:02:42] sacrificing reasonings Lord imaginations
[2:02:45] Oh God devotedness Lord single as Paul
[2:02:52] would saying as the Lord Jesus you had
[2:02:55] expressed to us in the gospel to be
[2:02:56] single let thine eye be single Oh God
[2:03:01] a clarity of devotion let everything be
[2:03:04] searched out Lord for truly in our life
[2:03:07] we don't want any hindrances Lord we
[2:03:10] want to please you Lord we want to
[2:03:14] please you Lord we've made mistakes
[2:03:17] there's decisions and things that have
[2:03:20] been done and through those things Lord
[2:03:23] we've learned sometimes Lord it's things
[2:03:26] right in the natural but we've learned
[2:03:27] and father within that learning lord is
[2:03:31] lord help us to be sensitive
[2:03:36] that learning is not always to take what
[2:03:38] just well it just think it just makes
[2:03:40] sense it's not what makes sense because
[2:03:43] Lord when it comes down to it crossing
[2:03:46] the Red Sea did not make sense it the
[2:03:52] way that you led your people the way you
[2:03:55] lead us to the carnal mind it doesn't

[2:10:20] don't you just appreciate the Lord he's
[2:10:26] brought about in our life what the
[2:10:28] desire was and the desire is to think
[2:10:33] about you know the desire when the Lord
[2:10:35] would first take a hold of our hearts
[2:10:38] it's that in itself is a mystery
[2:10:40] beginning to unfold but there begins to
[2:10:43] awaken a desire and I want to serve you
[2:10:48] Lord
[2:10:50] there's an awakening of that desire that
[2:10:53] it's a dawning of his life upon our
[2:10:56] hearts as we surrender and a life that
[2:11:00] surrender to that then it becomes a
[2:11:03] reality of serving the Lord to where our
[2:11:09] lives are in service to him we're not
[2:11:13] just ready for service but we're in
[2:11:16] service and when we're in service we're
[2:11:20] also making ourselves ready as Paul
[2:11:23] would say in Timothy so that we are
[2:11:26] vessels that are meat for the Masters
[2:11:28] use available I would say there's not
[2:11:33] probably a heart in here that wouldn't
[2:11:36] say Lord I want to be more available
[2:11:40] just want to be more available
[2:11:42] more of an amen
[2:11:47] we're gonna let you be dismissed in the
[2:11:49] name of the Lord Communion and I think
[2:11:52] we could start here at 3:30 it should
[2:11:55] allow just I don't want to have do we
[2:11:57] have a long time in between I think 3:30
[2:11:59] would be enough right now it's one about
[2:12:03] 1:15 or so so we'll come in come right
[2:12:10] in and take the communion in the
[2:12:13] foot-washing here this evening
