[37:26] if you'll turn with me thank you
[37:28] musicians tonight
[37:31] turn with me to Hosea chapter 2 I
[37:35] want to just just pick up there tonight
[37:39] if the Lord will help us
[37:46] in verse 14 we'll read a few verses and
[37:49] then I'll let you be seated and we'll
[37:51] continue from there
[37:55] Hosea chapter 2 verse 14
[38:01] therefore behold I will lure her and
[38:06] bring her into the wilderness and
[38:09] speak comfortably unto her
[38:12] and I will give her her vineyards from
[38:15] thence
[38:16] the valley of Achor for doroth hope and
[38:20] she shall sing there as in the days of
[38:23] her youth and as in the days when she
[38:26] come up out of the land of Egypt and it
[38:29] shall be at that day saith the lord thou
[38:32] shalt call me a shine and
[38:35] shalt call me no more Bailey well I will
[38:41] take away the names of Balaam out of her
[38:45] mouth and they shall no more be
[38:48] remembered by their name
[38:53] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[38:57] of his words you being seated
[39:02] what a promise as we have been looking
[39:05] here
[39:07] Exodus 15 and
[39:10] we see God bringing Israel
[39:14] back into the homeland and God is going
[39:20] to fulfill
[39:21] the word that he spoke concerning her
[39:26] when we look at it here in the
[39:28] scriptures the
[39:30] just we could spend from now to eternity
[39:34] just just with scriptures that pertain
[39:37] to God bringing Israel home and God
[39:41] making himself known to Israel and we
[39:45] could see that but as we also look at it
[39:48] and as the Lord has been helping us we
[39:50] see that there is a great parallel that
[39:53] runs between that of Israel and the
[39:56] natural
[39:57] and seeing that they are are the people
[40:01] are the people of God or known as a
[40:03] nation and it runs a parallel with that
[40:05] of the
[40:06] Gentiles that being the elect that are
[40:09] taken out of the Gentiles for his
[40:11] namesake and the scripture it goes on
[40:14] and you find that just as it is and many
[40:17] of the other times of of the prophets
[40:19] here as it speaks it goes on to let it
[40:23] be known in verse 18 it breaks right
[40:25] into a scripture dealing with the
[40:27] Millennium and then that day will I make
[40:29] a covenant for them with the beasts of
[40:31] the field and with the fowls of heaven
[40:33] and with the creeping things of the
[40:35] ground and I will break the bowl and the
[40:37] sword and the battle out of the earth
[40:40] and will make them to lie down safely
[40:42] and then the Lord here it comes back
[40:45] around and coming back into this of
[40:47] Israel and I want you just to notice
[40:49] these words that are spoken here in
[40:52] verses 19 and verse 20 and I will be
[40:56] truly speaking to Israel and I will
[40:59] betroth thee unto me forever
[41:02] yay I will be trow thee unto me in
[41:06] righteousness and in judgment and in
[41:09] loving-kindness and in mercies I will
[41:13] even be trophy unto me in faithfulness
[41:16] and Dow shall know the Lord and each one
[41:21] of these places here in the scriptures
[41:24] when we look here in these two verses
[41:26] this is the Lord's doing it is God that
[41:31] is bringing everything about for within
[41:34] Israel the same way that God has come
[41:38] and bringing things about to perform his
[41:41] word and calling out that of the elect
[41:45] of the Gentiles he goes on here in verse
[41:48] 21 it says and it shall come to pass in
[41:51] that day I will hear saith the Lord and
[41:54] I will hear the heavens and they shall
[41:57] hear the earth and the earth shall hear
[41:59] the corn and the wine and the oil and
[42:02] they shall hear Jezreel which means the
[42:06] lord souls verse 23 here this is
[42:09] speaking of us of the gen Tiles taking a
[42:11] people for his namesake and i will show
[42:15] her unto me in the earth and i will have
[42:17] mercy upon her that had not obtained
[42:20] mercy and I will say to them which were
[42:22] not my people thou art my people and
[42:25] they shall say thou art my god
[42:29] when you look at the the whole in this
[42:33] scripture I don't know how that anyone
[42:36] could not read within these the
[42:38] scriptures here and really throughout
[42:41] the whole Bible and not see the grace of
[42:44] God even God's grace that he would lead
[42:47] us to make us to know when were wrong
[42:51] and would lead us you know as David said
[42:54] I had fainted unless I had seen the
[42:57] goodness of God of the Lord in the land
[43:00] of the living and the Bible tells us in
[43:03] the book of Romans that the goodness of
[43:05] the Lord leadeth us to repentance and to
[43:07] see that God's grace that if not for the
[43:11] grace of God that you and I would have
[43:14] still been in the state and the
[43:17] situation that we were in when he came
[43:20] and he found us but you see when we look
[43:23] at this in the scripture we find that
[43:25] God has already made a solling there's
[43:28] an election there is an elect as we've
[43:31] looked at it of a hundred forty-four
[43:33] thousand that is to come forth after the
[43:37] bride has been taken out of here in
[43:39] rapture and and and then we also see
[43:43] that down through here which has been
[43:45] hidden down through the the ages Israel
[43:48] did not know anything of other Church
[43:50] ages Israel did not know even though
[43:53] these little parts of like we read here
[43:56] in the closing part of Hosea Israel did
[43:59] not realize this nor see this coming
[44:02] about this was a hidden mystery remember
[44:05] how Paul would speak in Ephesians and
[44:07] Colossians and he would speak of that
[44:10] hidden mystery of the bride of Jesus
[44:12] Christ of how that you and I we were
[44:15] there with we were chosen in God's mind
[44:18] and how that God Himself would choose
[44:22] how bright unto himself and then how
[44:24] that he would make himself known he
[44:27] would give his life and then we find the
[44:30] great parallel of how that through that
[44:33] of like what took place in the Garden of
[44:35] Eden that out of his side he would take
[44:38] for it the very elements that's which
[44:40] would make up his bride which would be
[44:43] his wife the Lambs wife as we know it
[44:46] and we realized that we're living in a
[44:48] time right now when we see things all
[44:51] around us I think of how that when
[44:53] brother Anna would say you know in them
[44:55] different places and the message clear
[44:58] from the earlier times and then as it
[45:00] continues to move on up you know even
[45:02] into recognizing it's day and it's 65
[45:05] and brother and wouldn't would say you
[45:07] know he says I ignored 64 sorry he says
[45:10] I don't see you know anything else left
[45:13] but then the coming of the Lord we're in
[45:15] that but the bride is taken out in
[45:18] rapture and then that of the two
[45:20] witnesses that would set up on the earth
[45:22] to call out the 144,000 and to see where
[45:26] that we are in this time remember that
[45:28] even brother Branham himself in the
[45:30] earlier times when they had sent down
[45:33] Bibles there to the Jews and the Jews
[45:35] were reading those Bibles that were
[45:37] synched to him and said if he is the
[45:39] Messiah let him come and let it and let
[45:41] him prove himself and to see how endure
[45:43] the random himself was ready he had the
[45:45] ticket he already went to Cairo you know
[45:48] and here he was standing at Cairo Egypt
[45:49] and he's standing there and he says you
[45:52] know I've already come this far I might
[45:54] as well go the rest of the way but to
[45:57] see how that God would get the attention
[46:00] of his servant to wear that you know the
[46:03] Lord would tell him this is not yet this
[46:06] is not your part and
[46:08] they even we're to think of this now to
[46:12] where even brother Branham would make a
[46:13] statement here he where he says I've
[46:16] always this was an earlier part before
[46:18] the seals were ever opened he says I've
[46:20] always believed that I would have a part
[46:22] within them but yet we recognize that
[46:24] even has God would continue to open the
[46:27] word that the Prophet himself would come
[46:30] around even in questions and answers and
[46:32] said on the seals and tell us and say
[46:34] God will not anoint a Gentile and send a
[46:37] Gentile prophet to the Jews it will be
[46:40] then of the Jews that God will raise up
[46:41] for he'll always speak to the Jews by
[46:44] the Jews and he speaks to the Gentiles
[46:47] he said he will not raise up a Jewish
[46:49] prophet to speak to the Gentiles the Jew
[46:51] God will raise up a Gentile prophet and
[46:54] to see that how that God has so made
[46:57] everything arranged everything it's such
[46:59] a tremendous way to think that even how
[47:02] the Prophet would have that of an
[47:04] inclination in that moment it shows you
[47:07] and I trust it does to where that we are
[47:10] truly living in the time of the coming
[47:13] of the Lord we are looking for that
[47:16] literal corporal coming of the Lord
[47:18] Jesus Christ we are awaiting for that
[47:21] because the Holy Spirit and I think of
[47:24] this now the Holy Spirit wearing that he
[47:26] has come in our lives and that's what
[47:29] prepares us and brings us to the
[47:32] watching and waiting of his literal
[47:36] corporal coming and that's what
[47:38] believers believe we're waiting for that
[47:42] we're looking for that and to realize
[47:44] that there are these things that where
[47:46] you and I are standing and how that the
[47:49] world and even when I would say world I
[47:51] would say that much of even Chris to
[47:54] them is looking for the coming of the
[47:56] Lord but yet they're looking for it in
[47:58] their way and to realize that the coming
[48:00] of the Lord is that which is revealed
[48:03] for revealed sovereignly by God to his
[48:07] people because God will not allow one of
[48:11] his children to be caught off guard the
[48:13] coming of the Lord Paul would say it
[48:15] like this he said you are children of
[48:17] the day he said I need not write unto
[48:19] you concerning this you are children of
[48:22] the line you know that day is
[48:24] approaching how because within our lives
[48:27] it is something to wear we're not just
[48:29] looking for event so I take for example
[48:31] the world you know when things have
[48:34] happened within the world like when we
[48:35] had 9/11 and so forth I would say I
[48:38] never looked it up but I would say
[48:40] church attendance sparked within that
[48:42] time there were people that started to
[48:45] pray that never prayed before he was
[48:47] like you know one time when we were on
[48:50] our way the one time I went to Honduras
[48:52] for the bill brother heard we were in
[48:53] the plane and we were just took off from
[48:55] tickle Zacapa and we were just flying to
[48:57] San Pedro Sula and when we were on the
[48:59] way that plane there was a big old crack
[49:01] in that plane I mean it just said bang
[49:04] and we thought you know and and it means
[49:07] that time you know all you seen beads
[49:09] come out
[49:10] people started praying because really
[49:13] you didn't know I mean it was loud it
[49:14] was a loud crack but you see within it
[49:17] there you know our lives when we are
[49:19] prepared for his coming now just listen
[49:22] to me now when we are prepared for his
[49:24] coming we are living every moment we are
[49:28] looking for his coming for him to come
[49:31] it's not something that we look at and
[49:34] say oh well it seems like this event is
[49:37] fading because even now you find that
[49:39] we're people themselves where they had
[49:41] stepped with the fervency and you know
[49:43] started to attend church and we know
[49:44] it's more than that but it just goes to
[49:46] show they really it is not about the
[49:49] coming of the Lord they're not really
[49:51] living for him are you with me it's just
[49:54] simply when something has come about and
[49:57] you know they they hear fear and and
[49:59] they move within it but my point within
[50:01] this is that God makes known hears his
[50:05] way of preparation that you and I might
[50:08] be ready when he himself does appear now
[50:12] when they think of this here Paul would
[50:14] would bring this up concerning Israel
[50:17] and in Israel and in Romans 11:25 Paul
[50:20] would say brethren you know I would not
[50:23] brethren that you should be ignorant of
[50:25] this mystery lest you should be wise in
[50:28] your own conceits that blindness in part
[50:31] has happened to Israel until the
[50:33] fullness of the Gentiles be come in so
[50:37] there is a space of time that God is
[50:40] dealing with the Gentiles just like it
[50:42] was stated there even in the the Gospels
[50:45] I believe it's Luke 24 where it speaks
[50:47] that how that the cities shall be
[50:49] trodden down until the fullness of the
[50:51] Gentiles come in and to know that there
[50:53] is there is a timing that God would deal
[50:55] and allow blindness to come to Israel
[50:58] now I'll say it like this
[51:00] same God that allowed blindness to come
[51:02] to Israel we are living in an age that
[51:04] is naked wretched and blind and don't
[51:08] know it you see it is the parallel the
[51:12] repeating here of where there was a
[51:15] blindness and then their fall turned to
[51:18] our salvation and now you find to where
[51:21] the finishing up of the Gentiles here
[51:24] the final outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[51:27] the finishing of the mystery of God the
[51:30] completing of that of his redeemable
[51:33] attributes that make up his bride and
[51:36] wants that he himself that last name
[51:39] where it has been splashed with in that
[51:41] Clorox bleach then he himself he comes
[51:45] to take us home with him to the wedding
[51:48] supper and then the two witnesses step
[51:51] on the scene for Israel so all of this
[51:54] is in God's timing and to think of this
[51:57] God's got all of this arranged
[52:02] every bit of it arranged verse 26 and so
[52:06] all Israel shall be saved as it is
[52:10] written there shall come out of Zion the
[52:13] deliverer and shall turn away
[52:15] ungodliness from Jacob for this is my
[52:20] covenant unto them when I shall take
[52:22] away their sins as concerning the gospel
[52:26] Paul said they are enemies for your
[52:29] sakes but as touching the election they
[52:32] are beloved for the father's sakes don't
[52:36] you love that
[52:38] God never he never in many places within
[52:43] the Scriptures that God would make known
[52:45] that I cannot forget Israel now remember
[52:49] here bringing Israel into the place and
[52:53] the finishing and fulfillment of the
[52:55] work is the magnifying and lifting up of
[52:58] his name so when we look at this of how
[53:02] that God not want you to think of this
[53:04] when they were on this journey remember
[53:06] each time when they were on this journey
[53:10] even in the times when God would tell
[53:12] Moses step aside Moses because I will
[53:15] smite I will slay every one of them and
[53:17] I'll raise up a new nation but the
[53:19] Spirit of Christ within Moses it reached
[53:23] out for the promise and says nay Lord
[53:27] don't do that Lord it stands in
[53:30] intercession for them notice how Moses
[53:33] even throughout those times would say if
[53:35] you do that then the nations themselves
[53:38] will raise up and say you were not able
[53:42] to bring them in
[53:45] and though it might look like around and
[53:49] among the nations and it would seem like
[53:51] that even after the rejection of the
[53:54] Messiah and Israel is scattered but God
[53:57] has not forgotten his word the Bible
[54:01] tells it like this I believe it's Isaiah
[54:03] 26 that he has not forgotten his word he
[54:07] waters it day and night it is a prompt
[54:11] limit just saying like this this promise
[54:13] you think that you get a promise on your
[54:15] heart and you take that promise let me
[54:18] tell you something God has had his word
[54:20] always before him his word is upon his
[54:24] mind his word is upon his heart his mind
[54:27] is on his word he has not forgotten one
[54:32] promise
[54:35] hallelujah even when he the mighty angel
[54:39] descends there in revelations 10 it is a
[54:42] rainbow about his head he's got his mind
[54:46] on his covenant
[54:49] think of this here how that Paul would
[54:52] further go into this and bringing it
[54:54] together with you and I he goes into 2nd
[54:57] Corinthians chapter 3 and says you know
[54:59] concerning with Moses and verse 13 he
[55:02] put a veil over his face that the
[55:04] children of Israel could not stedfastly
[55:06] look to the end of that which is
[55:09] abolished but their minds were blinded
[55:12] for unto this day remain at the same
[55:15] vail untaken away in the reading of the
[55:18] Old Testament which veil is done away in
[55:21] Christ
[55:22] so even though they read the Old
[55:25] Testament and the Old Testament holds
[55:28] within it the prophecies of the Messiah
[55:31] they read that they knew that now think
[55:34] of it here the Lord Jesus being the
[55:37] capping there of that Old Testament and
[55:39] now the life that was within the
[55:41] bridegroom is poured out and he gathers
[55:44] to himself a bride and the capping of
[55:47] that is his life himself personally
[55:50] identified within his bride and to think
[55:53] aware that this is within this time into
[55:58] a place to where it doesn't matter how
[56:00] much that they read the Old Testament
[56:02] and they know that but there is a veil
[56:05] that's upon their hearts and that veil
[56:08] can only be taken away by the Lord
[56:11] Himself
[56:12] it doesn't matter all of the words that
[56:15] they can put together steady and
[56:18] everything else it's not steadying that
[56:20] brings the word to life it takes the
[56:24] author himself to bring the word to life
[56:27] that's why when they heard the Lord
[56:29] Jesus they said never a man spake like
[56:32] this it was not that they never heard
[56:35] what he was saying they knew what it was
[56:37] never a man spake like this this man in
[56:40] speaking like the rest of them it was an
[56:43] authority you know why because that word
[56:46] he in that word were one and the same he
[56:49] was united with it and it was the
[56:51] presence of God that was a company that
[56:54] word he was not just reading something
[56:57] of which he himself was not a partaker
[57:00] of and of something that was separate
[57:02] from him but he and the way were one in
[57:05] the same and that's the same way it is
[57:07] with every true believer born of the
[57:10] Spirit of God when you ER dwelling in
[57:13] that word we are not saying something or
[57:16] doing something that is contrary to that
[57:19] word but it is the expression of our
[57:22] lives
[57:24] so the veil itself no matter how much a
[57:27] person could do they can never take that
[57:30] veil away what does it the grace of God
[57:34] but even unto this day when Moses is
[57:38] read the veil is upon their heart
[57:43] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[57:48] Lord the veil shall be taken away so it
[57:53] requires then it's God that will come
[57:56] the Lord through his word that he has
[58:00] promised and has his presence is moving
[58:03] in it will be the very Lord Himself that
[58:06] will actually turn the hearts of that of
[58:10] the elect of God you see many are
[58:12] reading that of the Old Testament but
[58:14] God himself knows there are those
[58:17] ordained who actually there's a veil
[58:20] upon their heart and there's little unis
[58:22] like now there is a hunger in their
[58:24] heart you know God begins to speak this
[58:27] down through the prophets you find it in
[58:28] Isaiah in Ezekiel in Jeremiah to where
[58:31] that there is a longing that stirs up
[58:33] even in that of the 144,000 and it's not
[58:37] even a knowledge of what am I longing
[58:39] for that don't even understand that you
[58:43] know even in the type that is sent when
[58:45] Israel was taken into captivity for 70
[58:47] years yet God would reveal even there to
[58:51] Daniel of the captivity from even that
[58:53] time when the Gentile kingdom would set
[58:56] in there would never kanessa and how
[58:58] that through those times of not just 270
[59:01] years but now those seventy weeks that
[59:03] are appointed there to the Jews of how
[59:05] that God would make known to Daniel
[59:08] there of how that he was going to deal
[59:10] with his people and God made these
[59:13] things known to Daniel and when God made
[59:16] it known to Daniel remember what Daniel
[59:18] said I then understood by the books
[59:22] you with me I understood by the books
[59:25] and the Prophet would take it up like
[59:26] this and said you know brother M says
[59:28] now we understand it by the Book of
[59:30] Daniel by the Book of Jeremiah by the
[59:32] Book of Isaiah by the book of James by
[59:34] the Book of Luke see it's a it's an all
[59:36] unfolding of the Lamb's Book of Life it
[59:40] all points to the goal to the
[59:43] achievement it points to the mystery of
[59:46] his coming because remember he's coming
[59:49] back for you and I and as he takes us
[59:51] away when we are there he will slip away
[59:54] and come back and make himself known to
[59:57] that of the hundred forty-four thousand
[59:59] and then he brings us back with him
[1:00:02] there riding upon those white horses
[1:00:05] there here we come riding down for that
[1:00:07] Battle of Armageddon before the
[1:00:09] Millennium ever sets in it is that that
[1:00:12] of how that God Himself is making
[1:00:14] himself and his word known in this hour
[1:00:17] and we realized this right here if we
[1:00:20] come back to this it takes God to take
[1:00:22] away the veil to see in our own lives
[1:00:25] you and I could read the scriptures but
[1:00:27] yet it takes God to come and remove the
[1:00:30] veil I won't ask you tonight but there's
[1:00:34] no doubt there's things that you and I
[1:00:36] can both read and there's things that we
[1:00:38] don't fully understand
[1:00:41] I'll tell you this right here I've been
[1:00:43] studying this too you know I'll call
[1:00:45] sorts of hours of the day of studying
[1:00:47] this of how he just broke but all sorts
[1:00:50] of time and I still come to a place and
[1:00:52] say where do I go
[1:00:54] when I go yeah it's something that
[1:00:57] within it there is so much of things
[1:00:59] that would break and we're looking at it
[1:01:02] and you know when we see these things it
[1:01:04] still takes God to open that you know
[1:01:06] hidden up to us to apply into it
[1:01:09] remember remember now the crowbar on the
[1:01:13] mountain was not a man using his
[1:01:15] strength to pry it off it was God giving
[1:01:18] provided timing and season for the light
[1:01:21] now to shine upon that if there's any
[1:01:24] strength to open the word it is not the
[1:01:27] strength of man because a man can pull
[1:01:30] back the lids of the book but it takes a
[1:01:32] lamb to break the seals from off of our
[1:01:35] eyes that you and I might clearly see
[1:01:38] so this is a work of the Lamb himself to
[1:01:42] actually turn the heart
[1:01:45] you know this is what God works with
[1:01:48] first he works with and he deals with
[1:01:51] our heart many times how God is dealing
[1:01:53] this is how he deals with all of us how
[1:01:55] he's brought all of us to where we are
[1:01:57] God deals with our heart you know God's
[1:01:59] field deals with our heart God will drop
[1:02:01] something on our heart and we'll take
[1:02:03] that we'll pray over it meditate over it
[1:02:05] and we realize God will give me the
[1:02:07] answer for that right there when I have
[1:02:09] need of it door you won't miss it
[1:02:12] because when you place it like that then
[1:02:15] if it's something you're reading you're
[1:02:16] hearing you're listening to the unction
[1:02:18] of the Holy Spirit will move right back
[1:02:19] around and bring whatsoever he has said
[1:02:22] back to your remembrance that is a
[1:02:24] working of the Spirit of Truth so when
[1:02:27] we look at this boy it just takes away
[1:02:28] there there shouldn't be any anxiety if
[1:02:30] there's something you don't understand
[1:02:32] put it before the Lord and watch God
[1:02:33] move on that behalf to you personally so
[1:02:36] there's a gathering we see that has been
[1:02:38] going on we have looked at that here for
[1:02:41] the past a couple times together there's
[1:02:43] a gathering that's going on remember all
[1:02:46] Israel remember the scriptures all
[1:02:48] Israel is not Israel
[1:02:51] all these rails not Israel there's an
[1:02:54] elected four to four thousand coming
[1:02:56] back into the land you know brother
[1:02:58] Brandon would even make a statement
[1:02:59] there in in Daniel seventy weeks and
[1:03:02] even even in beeban prior to that
[1:03:03] brother Graham would talk about he said
[1:03:05] surely he said there's 144,000 now and
[1:03:08] you you you know you and I would look at
[1:03:10] that statement but when you go back and
[1:03:12] look in history and when Israel
[1:03:14] themselves became a nation they're in in
[1:03:16] May and 1948 you realize that just
[1:03:19] within a short period of time Israel
[1:03:22] went from just I think it was a number
[1:03:24] you know close to 200,000 or 300,000 if
[1:03:27] we clear up into 800,000 just like that
[1:03:30] within just more just just a few years
[1:03:33] and you look at what was taking place
[1:03:35] then and look at what has been happening
[1:03:37] you know these things unless you keep up
[1:03:39] with it these things have already been
[1:03:41] taking place there's people
[1:03:43] organizations that sponsor called
[1:03:45] operation Exodus that's just one of many
[1:03:47] that actually gather in Jews and you
[1:03:51] know everything is set up so that their
[1:03:53] trip back home their one-way ticket all
[1:03:56] of that is put in place you say who is
[1:03:58] it that would give them the unction to
[1:04:00] do that friends it's the unction of the
[1:04:02] Holy Spirit for that hour now you might
[1:04:05] look at it and say I'm but you know that
[1:04:07] don't mean that everybody that takes
[1:04:08] that one-way ticket that they are part
[1:04:10] of that elect
[1:04:11] 144,000 no they may not be but they may
[1:04:14] have a child that is
[1:04:16] you see God knows what he's doing even
[1:04:20] when all the Israel came up out of the
[1:04:23] land of Egypt when glob was delivering
[1:04:25] Israel from Egypt there he was calling
[1:04:28] them out of Egypt just like you'll be
[1:04:30] calling them out of that Roman system
[1:04:32] there and those two witnesses how that
[1:04:34] God will move with him that time and to
[1:04:37] think of how that they came up out of
[1:04:39] there there was a mixed multitude
[1:04:45] when pressures came who caved the mixed
[1:04:49] multitude who was it that complained the
[1:04:52] mixed multitude I can tell you right now
[1:04:54] when you look at the amount of people
[1:04:56] who's coming back into Israel and you
[1:04:58] see them when they're getting off the
[1:05:00] planes now the flags are waving I think
[1:05:02] it's a wonderful thing you hear them
[1:05:03] singing the songs they're welcoming them
[1:05:05] but yet you realize that as they're
[1:05:07] coming back in there you look at that
[1:05:10] and you say when this word starts
[1:05:12] dropping it's going to start bringing
[1:05:14] folks in line it's going to Clark calls
[1:05:16] them in the street now they're going to
[1:05:18] have to wash their face they're going to
[1:05:19] have to change their clothes they're
[1:05:21] going to have to get right before God
[1:05:22] they're gonna have to want to line up
[1:05:25] with that word
[1:05:28] now you know it's just like this I've
[1:05:30] been in some times you know in preaching
[1:05:32] meetings for things and sometimes where
[1:05:34] there's been situations that people came
[1:05:36] and they came for the wrong reasons and
[1:05:38] then you know as as the Lord would move
[1:05:40] and they came for a wrong reason but yet
[1:05:43] after a period of time here the Lord
[1:05:45] would deal with something in a service
[1:05:47] and here they come and they stand right
[1:05:49] there you know and they'll say you know
[1:05:50] brother Samuel I did not come to this
[1:05:52] meeting for the right purpose I came you
[1:05:54] know to meet or whatever more but God
[1:05:56] has dealt with my heart in this service
[1:05:58] I want to surrender my life I want to
[1:06:01] rededicate my life to God man you know
[1:06:04] what if you're out looking at that and
[1:06:06] we knew about that young man or young
[1:06:08] lady and they were coming to that
[1:06:09] service you and I might look at it and
[1:06:11] say they ain't gonna get nothing out of
[1:06:13] it but you see this is where that God's
[1:06:15] ways are so much greater than our ways
[1:06:18] it's to trust the Living God because
[1:06:21] when you look at some of the interviews
[1:06:23] that they do with these people who are
[1:06:25] returning back some of them just say you
[1:06:27] know what there is no hope for me here
[1:06:29] in France there's no hope for me here I
[1:06:31] want my children you know to grow up in
[1:06:34] safety and there are things that they
[1:06:36] are looking at and there and there's
[1:06:38] mentioning but you know within it God
[1:06:40] knows who belongs to him
[1:06:44] he already knows that
[1:06:47] amen even when we had said the
[1:06:50] preparation for those who went before
[1:06:53] back in the land that was necessary it
[1:06:57] was necessary that the land start my
[1:07:00] mama I'm just gonna go with this tonight
[1:07:02] it's necessary that the land start being
[1:07:05] occupied it was necessary that desert
[1:07:08] places start being occupied it was
[1:07:11] necessary you know why that was
[1:07:13] necessary because there was gonna be
[1:07:15] more coming and you know this is where
[1:07:18] you and I are it was necessary that
[1:07:21] these parts of the word be occupied it
[1:07:24] ought to be where you and I can look at
[1:07:26] it now and say mine I see it like I
[1:07:28] never seen it before thank God you know
[1:07:30] what that is it's land that was occupied
[1:07:33] and now the land itself is beginning to
[1:07:36] bring forth and produce and you know
[1:07:38] what if God Terri's longer some of you
[1:07:41] as young people sitting right here and
[1:07:43] as God would Terry you'll be able to say
[1:07:46] a year from now few years from now say
[1:07:48] my goodness it's become even more clear
[1:07:51] why it's land that belongs to us this
[1:07:55] scriptural and
[1:07:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost it belongs to
[1:08:00] us
[1:08:01] there are repeater god
[1:08:05] hallelujah so to think how that when
[1:08:08] they came up out of Egypt there was a
[1:08:10] mixed multitude no doubt various a mixed
[1:08:12] multitude with the masses of people that
[1:08:15] are coming in there and we know that
[1:08:17] when we look at it we see also where
[1:08:19] Israel was drove back into that land a
[1:08:22] national force even as it is so right
[1:08:24] now many of them the reason that they're
[1:08:26] uprooting is because of national
[1:08:28] pressure that's come upon them they no
[1:08:31] longer feel at home
[1:08:33] you see it was Pharaoh that finally told
[1:08:37] them get out
[1:08:39] now you find how that pressures come in
[1:08:42] there that's exactly where we're heading
[1:08:45] to for the rapture to where the world
[1:08:47] finally says get out of here you see
[1:08:51] this is where the laws like you've
[1:08:53] spoken in the Book of Daniel he calls it
[1:08:55] laws to be passed and so forth that
[1:08:57] spirit that's behind that's motivating
[1:09:00] the governments of the world what is it
[1:09:02] all he cannot do anything unless God
[1:09:04] would first permitting there are laws
[1:09:06] that's on the books that's never been
[1:09:08] enforced all it takes for somebody to
[1:09:10] enforce them but you know what nothing
[1:09:13] can be done until every child of God has
[1:09:17] been sealed away
[1:09:19] [Applause]
[1:09:21] you already the God think about it when
[1:09:24] even there the world were one it broke
[1:09:27] out
[1:09:30] all of a sudden here the war it stops
[1:09:34] nobody knows what happened
[1:09:38] it wasn't a coincidence
[1:09:41] 11th month 11th day 11th hour that's God
[1:09:45] the world would call it coincidence but
[1:09:49] we call it God it was God signifying
[1:09:52] that before this earth can be cleaned
[1:09:56] off and prepared for the Millennium and
[1:09:59] I have got to take my bride in rapture
[1:10:04] and I must seal my servants
[1:10:07] 144,000 so no wonder in Revelation 7 is
[1:10:11] sent back to the four winds hold back
[1:10:13] the Wars and strife
[1:10:15] until I have sealed
[1:10:18] 144,000 you see God will not allow
[1:10:21] anything to happen not one word will be
[1:10:25] defeated it will not be listen to me
[1:10:28] there will not be one hide nor hoof left
[1:10:31] behind when they want and Moses to leave
[1:10:34] Egypt and leave your children behind
[1:10:36] leave your livestock behind but Moses
[1:10:39] said we're taking everyone with us I'll
[1:10:43] tell you this is the power of acclaiming
[1:10:46] revelation when you get that revelation
[1:10:49] it's an absolute in your heart it
[1:10:51] strains your life when you realize
[1:10:53] there's a power that's greater than me
[1:10:56] on the inside and that power has taken
[1:10:59] ahold of you it has released the
[1:11:01] attributes son and daughter of God on
[1:11:04] the inside and you realize that same
[1:11:06] power that there is not a prevailing
[1:11:09] power that can withstand that of the
[1:11:12] revelation of Jesus Christ and you stand
[1:11:15] there upon that word and you claim your
[1:11:18] children
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:22] if you don't claim of who will
[1:11:25] and know how you train them is by the
[1:11:29] confidence that you have within what God
[1:11:33] has done in your life
[1:11:37] all through this building right here no
[1:11:39] doubt there's many of us that we would
[1:11:41] have been wrote off friends and
[1:11:43] everything else said that God's past
[1:11:45] hold the girls past hope that's true
[1:11:47] when it came to earthly matters but
[1:11:51] nothing is impossible with God
[1:11:55] nothing
[1:12:00] you tell them mom and daddy of the
[1:12:02] prodigal son you tell them quit pray
[1:12:05] whether they had a reality it didn't
[1:12:08] matter if half the estate was gone it
[1:12:10] didn't matter they remain they held on
[1:12:12] to that that is my son
[1:12:15] you think they didn't stand there and
[1:12:17] quote the word no children are in
[1:12:19] heritage of the Lord
[1:12:21] you think they didn't quote that word
[1:12:24] come on somebody you know brother
[1:12:26] branham tells us concerning when Elijah
[1:12:28] girls angels were on the mountain you
[1:12:30] know brother Ram tells us Elijah didn't
[1:12:33] see those angels when he said there's
[1:12:35] more with us than there is with Sam he
[1:12:37] said Amy said what it was he'll I sure
[1:12:39] held the word up that they're angels of
[1:12:42] God are encamped about them that fear
[1:12:44] him he put his trust in the world of the
[1:12:47] Lord he knew God said it but here
[1:12:50] they're here
[1:12:54] God's Word it's a solid solid place to
[1:12:59] stand
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:02] on the ground is sinking samba his word
[1:13:07] it's solid
[1:13:10] nations can shake the world can shake
[1:13:14] the earth can shake but he does not
[1:13:18] shake Oh
[1:13:23] glory
[1:13:25] for if the casting away of them be the
[1:13:30] reconciling of the world what shall the
[1:13:34] receiving of them be
[1:13:36] but life from
[1:13:38] the dead
[1:13:42] we were once dead in sin and trespasses
[1:13:49] but what happened but he quickened us
[1:13:55] he raised us
[1:14:01] not one of us were seeking for him
[1:14:05] but say me there was some longing within
[1:14:08] me that's because he put that longing in
[1:14:10] you
[1:14:11] [Applause]
[1:14:14] go her to be to God yes sir to think of
[1:14:18] this what shall the receiving of them be
[1:14:20] but life from the dead for if the
[1:14:23] first-fruit be holy the lump is also
[1:14:25] holy and if the root be holy so are the
[1:14:28] branches and Hosea 6:1 come let us
[1:14:31] return unto the Lord for he hath torn
[1:14:34] and he will heal us he hath smitten and
[1:14:37] he will bind us up after two days he
[1:14:41] will revive us in the third day we we
[1:14:45] will raise us up and we shall live in
[1:14:48] his sight
[1:14:50] come let us return unto the Lord who is
[1:14:54] it it's God drawing Israel to return
[1:14:59] the same God that has thrown you and I
[1:15:03] the same God it pulls on our hearts even
[1:15:07] so come quickly Lord Jesus is God
[1:15:11] pooling on her heart and notice after
[1:15:13] two days after two thousand years he
[1:15:16] will revive us he he will revive us he
[1:15:21] will remove the veil he turns our hearts
[1:15:24] I
[1:15:25] will be trophy unto me I will make
[1:15:29] myself known unto thee and
[1:15:32] we shall live in his sight have eternal
[1:15:35] life
[1:15:36] oh
[1:15:37] my notice here in the Book of Ezekiel
[1:15:42] we'll just see how far we get here
[1:15:44] tonight but in the Book of Ezekiel
[1:15:48] here the scripture makes no the hand of
[1:15:54] the Lord was upon me and carried me out
[1:15:57] in the spirit of the Lord set me down in
[1:15:59] the midst of the valley which was full
[1:16:02] of boys and caused me to pass by them
[1:16:06] roundabout and behold there were very
[1:16:09] many in the open valley hello they were
[1:16:12] very dry and he said unto me son of man
[1:16:19] can these bones
[1:16:21] live notice son of man prophet and I
[1:16:25] answered Oh Lord God thou knowest
[1:16:31] can they live again thou knowest what
[1:16:35] a sight a valley of dry bones
[1:16:41] no doubt many of us have never come into
[1:16:44] any place where we saw bones scattered
[1:16:46] around like that sometimes I know when
[1:16:49] you you know at times when we hunted out
[1:16:51] there I think one time was something
[1:16:52] with brother herb out there off Jones
[1:16:54] Road and I was out there and you know
[1:16:55] light and stuff begin to break and I
[1:16:57] looked around there and I was sitting in
[1:16:58] bones I thought what in the world is all
[1:17:01] around me here it was nothing but what
[1:17:03] must have been with them cows they took
[1:17:04] him and slaughtered him there in the
[1:17:05] edge of that woods it was setting around
[1:17:07] bones you know looking at a bunch of
[1:17:09] bones don't look real good
[1:17:12] you with me it don't look real good so
[1:17:16] when we look at this here how that blood
[1:17:18] brings him into a situation that it
[1:17:21] would look like and seemed entirely
[1:17:23] hopeless and again he said unto me
[1:17:27] prophesy upon these bones and say unto
[1:17:31] them all ye dry bones hear the word of
[1:17:36] the Lord so evidently these bones can
[1:17:40] hear and God knows bacon here
[1:17:44] and God knows what they can hear and
[1:17:47] will respond to is the word of the Lord
[1:17:51] coming through
[1:17:52] son of man
[1:17:54] it will it will actually in loose and
[1:17:57] that they're able to hear the word
[1:18:00] thus saith the Lord God unto these bones
[1:18:04] behold I will cause breath to enter into
[1:18:08] you and ye shall live and I will lay
[1:18:12] sinews upon you and bring you up flesh
[1:18:16] upon you and cover you a skin and put
[1:18:19] breath in you and ye shall live you
[1:18:22] shall know that I am the Lord
[1:18:26] notice I will I will I will I will I
[1:18:30] will and you shall know that i am the
[1:18:34] lord why because it is him knowing that
[1:18:37] our
[1:18:38] lives are not the work of man
[1:18:42] our lives are the work of the Lord God
[1:18:48] every one of us is children of God we
[1:18:51] were just like these bones
[1:18:54] bones yes bones we were ordained brother
[1:18:59] Doug as parts of his body
[1:19:02] we did not know that we were ordained
[1:19:06] parts of the body of Jesus Christ but he
[1:19:09] knew where you at bones
[1:19:12] [Applause]
[1:19:13] just like he knew where the hundred
[1:19:16] forty-four thousand he knows where
[1:19:18] they're at
[1:19:21] no doubt there's a lot of dirt where the
[1:19:23] word is spoken but the word came for the
[1:19:26] bones
[1:19:27] come on somebody the dirt gets hot from
[1:19:31] the Sun the rock gets hot from the Sun
[1:19:33] but the seed on the inside says oh thank
[1:19:36] you Father
[1:19:37] thank you Father it's warming me up now
[1:19:41] notice this so I prophesied as I was
[1:19:45] commanded
[1:19:47] so let me get this straight
[1:19:50] son of man he prophesized as he's
[1:19:53] commanded and God comes behind the word
[1:19:56] and performs his own word
[1:20:00] so then who gets the glory he does the
[1:20:04] Son of Man just happens to be one who's
[1:20:07] in contact with God that God can make
[1:20:09] his word known to and speak his word
[1:20:12] through for surely the Lord will not do
[1:20:15] anything except he revealed first his
[1:20:18] word to his servants the prophets oh my
[1:20:21] so I prophesied as I was commanded and
[1:20:24] as I prophesied there was a noise or he
[1:20:27] and the hold of shaking and the bones
[1:20:30] came together bone to his bone in that
[1:20:33] incredible brother a you didn't have to
[1:20:35] say hey femur bone I want you to join up
[1:20:37] with this bone hey hey you listen listen
[1:20:39] no no no no no you need to be right over
[1:20:40] here hey hey brother they no no no not
[1:20:42] right there you are in an amazing the
[1:20:44] world holds the mystery and the order
[1:20:48] and positioning of our lives in the body
[1:20:52] of Jesus Christ
[1:20:53] just as the word itself the name being
[1:20:57] revealed and going forth positionally
[1:21:00] places us in Jesus Christ that's the
[1:21:03] same way it is for Israel the word when
[1:21:07] it's spoken brother it's not the
[1:21:09] intelligence of a man it's the
[1:21:11] intelligence of Almighty God that same
[1:21:14] intelligence that operates even the very
[1:21:17] cells of our body
[1:21:21] what tells the liver cell to go to the
[1:21:23] liver what tells the kidneys sale go to
[1:21:26] the kidney
[1:21:28] what does that brother had them what
[1:21:30] tales along sell to go to a lung sale
[1:21:32] who does that it's an ordained placement
[1:21:36] even in our natural body God shows
[1:21:39] positioning and placement
[1:21:43] for a better God
[1:21:45] and when I beheld lo the sinews and the
[1:21:49] flesh came upon them and the skin
[1:21:53] covered them above but there was no
[1:21:56] breath in them then he said unto me
[1:21:59] prophesy unto the wind
[1:22:02] prophesy on a man and say to the wind
[1:22:06] thus saith the Lord God come from the
[1:22:10] four winds o breath and breathe upon the
[1:22:13] slain that they may live
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:18] what's happening the world is
[1:22:22] transforming this situation
[1:22:27] that's exactly what God has done and is
[1:22:30] doing in our life it's the same thing
[1:22:32] that God Himself will do and is doing
[1:22:36] for Israel I
[1:22:42] won't ask you to raise your hand because
[1:22:44] everyone does have both hands up and our
[1:22:46] feet up to where but we're all many
[1:22:48] times we get impatient and
[1:22:51] brother dynam gives such wonderful
[1:22:54] counsel in the beginning of power
[1:22:55] transformation and he says when God says
[1:22:57] something he will bring it to pass he
[1:23:00] said now for you and I many times we get
[1:23:02] impatient
[1:23:04] we can't see growth like we like to see
[1:23:07] it we can't see certain things and we
[1:23:09] get impatient but what he said he said
[1:23:11] you stay with that word he said even if
[1:23:15] it's a word that come to you he said in
[1:23:17] the man that preached it to you that man
[1:23:19] may no longer stand for God whatsoever
[1:23:21] he said it wasn't a man's word that
[1:23:23] transforms you it was God's Word it
[1:23:26] wasn't the man it was God
[1:23:32] glory be to God you see this is the
[1:23:35] confidence that I have I have confidence
[1:23:38] within this word this message preaching
[1:23:41] this living reality that it will bring
[1:23:44] the change in hearts I know sometimes
[1:23:46] he's got a correctness he's got to skin
[1:23:49] us down by we thank God for that but let
[1:23:51] me tell you something friends it's got
[1:23:53] to take a word that's able to override
[1:23:56] and
[1:23:57] on the inside to where it brings about a
[1:23:59] change to where you and I can see and we
[1:24:02] receive strength
[1:24:08] verse 10 let me try to get through this
[1:24:12] so I prophesied has he commanded me and
[1:24:16] the breath came into them and they lived
[1:24:20] and stood up on their feet and exceeding
[1:24:23] great army so notice a little bit
[1:24:25] brother bill would be prophesied and
[1:24:26] then things would take place and then
[1:24:29] here the Lord would come along and he
[1:24:31] would tell son of man this is what you
[1:24:33] need to do okay so he would do that and
[1:24:35] then here this is what you need to do
[1:24:37] and then he would do that you see
[1:24:38] everything itself is a work of the Lord
[1:24:41] it wasn't just good enough to have bones
[1:24:43] come together but he had to actually
[1:24:45] bring all the ligaments tendons sinews
[1:24:48] flesh all of those things had to
[1:24:50] actually come into its position and then
[1:24:53] life would have to enter into that body
[1:24:57] looks like a pretty hopeless situation
[1:25:00] if we're just looking at it ourselves
[1:25:03] but God specializes in taking dry bones
[1:25:10] then he said unto me verse 11 son of man
[1:25:14] these bones are the whole house of
[1:25:17] Israel behold they say our bones are
[1:25:22] dried and our hope is lost we are cut
[1:25:26] off for our parts therefore prophesy and
[1:25:29] say unto them thus saith the Lord God
[1:25:32] behold o my people glorious joy to God I
[1:25:37] feel like getting another language right
[1:25:39] now
[1:25:40] notice what they're saying I hope is cut
[1:25:44] off what hope is there do you realize
[1:25:46] when we look at things in our own
[1:25:48] strength that's exactly how it looks to
[1:25:51] you and I but remember when I said thus
[1:25:54] saith the Lord behold
[1:25:57] my people oh that phrase is a powerful
[1:26:01] phrase behold o my people not just
[1:26:06] anybody my people I
[1:26:10] will open your graves and
[1:26:15] tells you to come up out of your graves
[1:26:18] from the nation's and bring you into the
[1:26:22] land of the Israel
[1:26:27] in amazing it's like blindnesses over
[1:26:30] the whole earth almost they don't even
[1:26:32] realize what's going on they don't know
[1:26:35] what's taking place even what has been
[1:26:37] happening and
[1:26:39] if not for the grace of God we wouldn't
[1:26:43] either
[1:26:49] verse 13 and ye shall know that I am the
[1:26:54] Lord
[1:26:56] you shall know no no question you will
[1:26:59] know that I am the Lord when I have
[1:27:02] opened your grace o my people and
[1:27:06] brought you up out of your graves and
[1:27:09] shall put my spirit in you and you shall
[1:27:14] live and I shall place you in your own
[1:27:17] land then shall you know that I the LORD
[1:27:21] have spoken it and performed it saith
[1:27:24] the Lord
[1:27:28] can you imagine when the Israel stands
[1:27:30] there has God deals with their life The
[1:27:34] Fountains open for him
[1:27:36] then the Lamb himself steps forward the
[1:27:40] word does not diminish it becomes more
[1:27:45] real
[1:27:47] real that it is the Lord that has done
[1:27:52] this if not for the mercies of the Lord
[1:27:56] gathering us in we would still be
[1:27:59] scattered
[1:28:01] we would still be scattered we would
[1:28:03] still be in our graves
[1:28:07] but God have a promise
[1:28:12] he would take the maturity of the word
[1:28:16] in this hour and wave it over a people
[1:28:21] there to call us out of dock
[1:28:24] denominationalism and bring us to
[1:28:27] himself when you and I were back there
[1:28:30] we didn't know how to get out I know I
[1:28:31] wasn't in maybe a stained-glass prison
[1:28:34] but I was in a prison among first nature
[1:28:37] I needed deliverance you need a
[1:28:40] deliverance I
[1:28:43] set around this message I heard it I
[1:28:46] could quote it but I knew I didn't have
[1:28:48] the reality in my soul
[1:28:52] but there was something that rose up and
[1:28:55] what it was it was designed and how God
[1:28:58] journey and God's wrong there were bars
[1:29:01] brother Carlos we couldn't get out of
[1:29:03] those bars but the word of the Lord was
[1:29:06] spoken house of Hale give way in the
[1:29:10] name of Jesus Christ
[1:29:13] behold o my people I have brought you
[1:29:17] out of grace
[1:29:19] bringing you back to myself Oh
[1:29:28] Lord
[1:29:33] throw it eater god
[1:29:40] hallelu
[1:29:43] I'm glad he's in control
[1:29:51] you don't know what to say I don't know
[1:29:53] what to say but he can say speak this
[1:29:55] say this do this it's his body that's
[1:30:00] yielded to him and then as we yield to
[1:30:03] that it's not us it's him
[1:30:06] it's him doing the work
[1:30:12] look at this as we close here we'll just
[1:30:14] stop here tonight
[1:30:20] no doubt within every one of us there's
[1:30:23] been times of things where there's been
[1:30:26] divisions that's come up
[1:30:28] divisions sometimes in a church division
[1:30:30] among families you know the realities of
[1:30:33] it is as much as we try and we work with
[1:30:35] things and you know you can't do it by
[1:30:38] the instrumentality of man
[1:30:40] just trust me okay if you've never tried
[1:30:44] it trust me it'll backfire on you now
[1:30:47] that's not putting anybody down it's you
[1:30:49] know what it all comes down to it's
[1:30:50] God's timing
[1:30:52] it's God's timing it's not ranging
[1:30:55] things together you know like you get
[1:30:56] kids out there on a playground you say
[1:31:00] tell Johnny you're sorry time you didn't
[1:31:03] mean to hit him in the head with that
[1:31:04] kickball
[1:31:06] sorry
[1:31:09] he said it but he didn't say it you with
[1:31:13] me
[1:31:14] even though we know that's the right
[1:31:16] thing to do we teach our children we
[1:31:18] worked through all those saints but you
[1:31:19] see God wants it from our heart
[1:31:22] got this and like divisions he doesn't
[1:31:25] he was spoken in the body I don't like
[1:31:27] schisms I don't like things that divide
[1:31:29] but I like he God's desire is for his
[1:31:32] people to be one but not oneness by that
[1:31:34] of man that's the one that's a man but
[1:31:37] God one loves his people to be one with
[1:31:39] him when we are one with him it'll take
[1:31:42] care it'll work being one with one
[1:31:44] another you with me it'll work that way
[1:31:47] now to think of this so we're here we
[1:31:49] are standing in this moment I really am
[1:31:51] I'm closing I'm not gonna go any further
[1:31:53] than this but to look at how that times
[1:31:55] there's not one of us not one person in
[1:31:58] here whether it's been on your job
[1:31:59] whether it's been your home church
[1:32:01] wherever more nobody likes division and
[1:32:03] we should the same that's a co-worker it
[1:32:06] still should be something in your heart
[1:32:08] that you do not sanction division
[1:32:13] this is not in my notes a reference as
[1:32:16] far as the scriptures but this is just
[1:32:18] exactly what he's given me right now
[1:32:21] division itself we know it's not of God
[1:32:24] so in order to combat that we cannot
[1:32:27] combat it with earthly measures the only
[1:32:31] way then we can come against division is
[1:32:34] with divine love
[1:32:36] that's the only way it can be done now
[1:32:39] to think of this here is to the houses
[1:32:42] of Israel remember when Solomon himself
[1:32:45] as his heart was departing from God and
[1:32:47] God had raised up and let it be known
[1:32:49] through Rio balm that the kingdom would
[1:32:50] be separated there would be better the
[1:32:52] ten tribes that would go and then you
[1:32:54] know you would have that of the tribe
[1:32:55] that would be here that are Judah and
[1:32:57] how that this division would come about
[1:32:59] but yet God himself has already made a
[1:33:02] promise he will bring that division and
[1:33:06] bring that healing among them and to
[1:33:09] realize even how God will do it even in
[1:33:12] the book of Zechariah believe it Araya
[1:33:14] 12 verse 8 or something of even how that
[1:33:16] he will save the tents of Judah first of
[1:33:18] how that God will so set everything in
[1:33:21] such a divine order so that one does not
[1:33:24] rise up against the other God still
[1:33:26] maintains my order and then when you
[1:33:28] come into this time of Israel it's not
[1:33:31] going to be 10 tribes over here and one
[1:33:33] tribe over there it is going to be
[1:33:35] recognized as the nation of Israel it
[1:33:40] will not be a separated group of tribes
[1:33:42] but how can this be done it will be done
[1:33:45] by the love of God pouring into the
[1:33:48] hearts of the elect children of God and
[1:33:51] as what is it doing it's God Himself
[1:33:53] moving down and as they're yielding
[1:33:55] they're uniting with him and as they are
[1:33:58] uniting with him his name is being
[1:34:01] reflected and manifested through them
[1:34:04] and it actually brings unity because the
[1:34:07] focus is not upon one another the focus
[1:34:10] is upon here
[1:34:16] sometimes this is where we get in
[1:34:18] trouble
[1:34:19] we focus on the division instead of
[1:34:22] focusing on the healer
[1:34:26] sometimes we try to make things come
[1:34:28] together and we're working and we get
[1:34:30] frustrated let's just be honest you get
[1:34:32] frustrated because if you have review
[1:34:34] every bit of a good intentions and what
[1:34:35] you try to do it looks like it just
[1:34:37] backfired right back on you but you know
[1:34:40] what it is it's God wanting us to trust
[1:34:42] him
[1:34:47] this church is his work and the Imams
[1:34:51] will say like this you might as well say
[1:34:53] I'm his work my family is his work
[1:34:57] because it isn't just me taking a word
[1:35:00] and saying but I almost straight in this
[1:35:01] situation out that fire you know
[1:35:03] backfire on you but instead of looking
[1:35:06] at the word and praying over it and say
[1:35:09] God let my heart be so right and prepare
[1:35:12] the heart Lord because after all in
[1:35:14] order to bring about division in order
[1:35:17] to resolve that and bring unity it's got
[1:35:20] to begin right here with a long longing
[1:35:22] I'm longing to be United and the logging
[1:35:26] to be United
[1:35:28] supersedes
[1:35:30] all of these little concerns and I say
[1:35:35] little I know sometimes I sing big but
[1:35:38] in reality when we get to looking at his
[1:35:40] presence and him we realize you know
[1:35:45] what that ain't nothing
[1:35:48] you let somebody brother Brandon tells
[1:35:51] us in the message he said you let
[1:35:53] something happen he said you might have
[1:35:55] something maybe in your heart he said
[1:35:57] that you let something happen he said
[1:35:58] maybe the brother Neville ordered this
[1:36:00] brother he said Oh mine you watched that
[1:36:02] brotherly love raise up
[1:36:04] it's something that raises up within us
[1:36:08] brother Branham told us he said he'll
[1:36:11] punch at you he'll punch at you and try
[1:36:13] to make you have different feelings but
[1:36:15] keep them and take them before the Lord
[1:36:20] Lord let my focus be on you
[1:36:24] if our focus is upon him then he will
[1:36:29] direct us or you or me and you know what
[1:36:32] it does it allows him to flow through
[1:36:35] and take what he shows in Ezekiel in
[1:36:38] these scriptures he had two sticks one
[1:36:41] stick was Ephraim 10 tribes of Israel
[1:36:43] another one Joseph represents Judah and
[1:36:46] he said that write the names upon that
[1:36:48] stick and he said you make them one
[1:36:50] stick now you tell me brother Carlos how
[1:36:52] you got two sticks and you make one
[1:36:54] stick out of two sticks I'll tell you
[1:36:57] what it you ain't gonna do with duct
[1:36:59] tape flex tape Gorilla Tape whatever
[1:37:02] more it's gonna take a union with God
[1:37:06] it'll take a union by the Holy Ghost
[1:37:10] I'll tell you God can repair things that
[1:37:13] are ripped that which is torn that which
[1:37:16] is broken our God means means the broken
[1:37:22] heart I've got heels divisions
[1:37:29] and they just let me just stop here and
[1:37:31] read this to you
[1:37:36] you love the Lord
[1:37:40] Ezekiel 37 verse 21
[1:37:44] thus saith the Lord God this is what I
[1:37:48] want you to say into them thus saith the
[1:37:50] Lord God
[1:37:51] behold I will take the children of
[1:37:53] Israel from among the heathen whether
[1:37:55] they be gone and I will gather them on
[1:37:58] every side and bring them into their own
[1:38:01] land and I will make them one nation in
[1:38:05] the land upon the mountains of Israel
[1:38:07] and one King shall be king to them all
[1:38:11] this is breaking over into the
[1:38:12] Millennium and they shall be no more two
[1:38:15] nations
[1:38:18] neither shall they be divided into two
[1:38:22] kingdoms any more at all neither shall
[1:38:26] they defile themselves any more with
[1:38:28] their idols nor with their detestable
[1:38:30] things nor with any of their
[1:38:32] transgressions but I will save them out
[1:38:35] of all their dwelling places whether
[1:38:37] they have sinned and will cleanse them

[2:08:33] it used to be before your presence came
[2:08:39] and changed me
[2:08:41] [Music]
[2:08:42] Oh
[2:08:44] won't go back I can't go back to the way
[2:08:50] it used to be before your presence came
[2:08:56] it changed me
[2:08:59] all my shame
[2:09:04] my gear
[2:09:09] see
[2:09:12] it's forgiving
[2:09:17] no more change
[2:09:21] no morphine
[2:09:25] my pad
[2:09:30] it's over
[2:09:36] right now is the moment
[2:09:40] to day
[2:09:42] is the day I've been chained
[2:09:47] I
[2:09:52] I have
[2:09:54] waited for this moment to come and I
[2:10:00] won't let it pass me by
[2:10:07] so we sing I won't go back I can't go
[2:10:13] back to the way it used to be before
[2:10:18] your presence came and changed me
[2:10:23] [Applause]
[2:10:24] [Music]
[2:10:26] won't go back I can't go back to the way
[2:10:32] you used to be before your presence came
[2:10:37] and changed me
[2:10:42] never going back
[2:10:46] I'm never
[2:10:48] going back
[2:10:49] no never
[2:10:52] going back
[2:10:54] to the way
[2:10:57] it was
[2:10:59] never
[2:11:00] going back
[2:11:02] no never
[2:11:04] going back
[2:11:07] never
[2:11:09] going back to the way

[2:11:39] to the way it used to be
[2:11:42] for your presence can

[2:11:48] [Music]
