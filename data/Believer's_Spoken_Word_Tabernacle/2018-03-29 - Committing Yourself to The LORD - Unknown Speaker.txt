[Music] Oh [Music] he wants Peas [Music] Hey I believe that tonight that's our confession has done and made known to our hearts what a what a blessed privilege it is and reality within our hearts know that we serve it's not just something that you know it's known because that in itself is not anything that just by words can be proven but it is that which God Himself comes and prove that he indeed is alive in that wonderful that brings that brings the real comfort and confidence in our hearts and our lives in the word of the Lord we just want to ask you to stand with us and we want to go right into the word totally good to be good to be back home with you and I certainly say I just appreciate the prayers Wow who has gone there with the saints that are there in Connecticut just ask you just continue to keep them in prayer that the Lord would just open the door for whom he has stand-in there as a pastor and we just the Lord just led us on a channel with some things that we spoke on there and the Lord just just richly just so wonderful see God just come behind his word and moving I just bring confidence to the hearts of the people and you know God knows exactly he knows what he's doing so we we just thank the Lord for that and still just have received even a testimony the other night from the services there and so we just thank God we know that all we can do is be vessels but it's in God's hands God comes and he moves through his word to minister to our heart you're loving tonight amen let's look here in the scriptures in 1st Peter chapter 2 and we want to just read a few verses of Scripture here verse 13 a little bit of a longer passage reading here but in verse 13 of first Peter chapter 2 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto Governors has unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of God that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of God so when you look at this here in the scripture and verse 16 think of this of how that even when the disciples were brought and there in the very beginning of the book of Acts and they had or they had posed the question to the council there should we obey God's words or your words they were not being arrogant and neither were they taking and using their liberty for a cloak of maliciousness so what Peter is dealing with here by the Spirit of God is is that where that the Liberty of God that is set us free is not in a manner to say I don't have to do that because I'm a Christian and we're not talking about when things infringe upon that within the word but we even look at things that where you have your bosses you have your kings you have different ones and there are requests that are made sometimes even in the workplace and different things that you look at and you think that's unreasonable with me but here Peters saying don't use your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness another that you don't have to move along with that but he rather he says honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God honor the king servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward it's easy when it's to the good in general but the froward this is where the trial of faith comes for this is think worthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrong for what glory is that if when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God right here in this scripture there's a lot of suffering that we that can be done that is not even anything that is actually the perfecting or the molding of our faith but we can still learn from even things that we and ourselves would bring on ourselves you with me it's not this is the things it's it's easy for us to look at that and say well you know take patiently for my for my faults but yet if you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God for even hereunto were he called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his footsteps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls let's just let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we just Lord arrive and come to this place Lord in the service dear God we're just looking to you tonight that you would just lord help us Lord to together collectively be able to move out of the way and Lord that you would come and speak to us Lord our hearts Lord minister to Lord our needs tonight father Lord we give ourselves to you and that you would have your way among us in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you may be seated man it's good to have ones with you I know brother Kadima text me today knowing that that he's back and we just asked that God will give him strength within his within his body and from the flight and everything that is there where he's been and traveling and all the events that's taking place and just continuing to keep them in prayer and say it's good Carlos and mr. Herman we're gonna make it by God's grace through this flu season we're gonna make it through this flu season don't shake my hand but we're gonna make it have like walk walk through any bacterial mist when we come in the door you know and like a relaxing like security blankets you know so we were just so thankful to God for His mercy and I just want to take a thought here tonight and look at this thought for a few moments on committing yourself to the Lord and this this very word out of that scripture verse 23 where it speaks from verse 21 even through verse 25 of what the Spirit of God even in those previous scriptures have spoke of that it lets us know that what is being called for that this same life in that dwelt within the body of Jesus Christ that it has within it the apps' the ability and the strength that we can live this kind of a surrendered life and this is example you know many times when things that take place when they're going to come out with a new model of a vehicle or whatever more they have what they call a prototype and prototypes they're really not real there are things that you look at them they look nice and sometimes they you know they fit them on a certain scale and then they'll make them bigger and larger but they're only all they are is just to be able to look at it but the Lord Jesus Christ was not a prototype it was God come down and dwell among us take upon a body made in the likeness of sinful flesh just as you and I dwell and walk in this mortality and he showed and demonstrated and was an example to us of what a son and daughter of God is to be in God and so when we look at that this is a confidence that we can have it's not the confidence of our own ability but it's the confidence that is in him and the confidence of an inward work that what not only he has done but what is continually being unfolded in our life a committal itself is not something that in any way that I would even venture to give to you that it is something that is just named and claimed how committal itself is not just something that is just somewhat easily done but a committal itself is where there is a real a surrender to Almighty God even in every situation and sometimes that committal it takes us time of praying and really recognizing what the real battle is and that's things that it's that we need the help of the Holy Spirit in looking at this because we are always approached the enemy is constantly approaching us on every side the Bible says he is a roaring lion roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour so he's constantly he's constantly as brother BAM will tell us in the message contest he's constantly studying of even how that we would handle that word and so we don't want to focus upon that our victory over the enemy is the victory of Christ in our lives and it is with that continual committal of our own lives unto Him now you think of this here when any of you have ever been in any type of a Mabius procedure a surgery and maybe you haven't but at least you could even relate to this that when you come into that place to even commit to have such a procedure or whatever more you have to be at at rest or to where that you are at that place to be able to relinquish yourself into the hands of that surgeon or that individual for them to be able to perform the task and you know I want you to think of this there they they know even as you're coming into some of those procedures you know they can come in and they'll talk to you and they'll go through all of those extra lengths the doctor in itself doesn't necessarily have to come in and see you before he's gonna operate on you and open you up but what he does has come in and he's talking with you many times they'll have the bedside manner they'll just Pat you on the on the hand they can tell you no and they can ask a person are you nervous no no I'm not nervous I'm fine I'm totally calm I mean they they'll know that and so they come in their objective is to try to settle you as much as as much as what they can and then there's things that's going to be given that will actually help you and calm you down and then we know even when it comes to if it's necessary for an anesthesia all of that to take place in order for them to perform what needs to be done and I sell you this tonight that God has not left it to you and I for us to rely upon our own strength or our own abilities to be able to bring ourselves to a committal but he himself knows exactly how to move touch our lives speak to our hearts to where that we ourselves are relaxing in his presence to where that he can move and perform his word in our lives that is that is him that is able to create that atmosphere and that brings our hearts into submission or committal to him so this word committal itself is to give into the hands of another and in the Simonian church age brother Branham he puts it like this he says the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and he goes on to say of how that Paul spoke that he's left the church a measure of suffering that they to by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection and we were looking at this year for some time that this perfection that God is calling for and desires out of our life is not the perfection in the sense that you never make mistakes that is that's the wrong goal but the perfection that begins from within our lives by moving into that perfection of Christ's own life then it is him himself the yielding the submission it never ceases it doesn't stop it continues to move and think about which there with the tenseness of time and the tenseness of life you know it's no Marvel for for a young couple when they are married you know for the the committal and the submission back and forth but let the tools and the tests and the trials of life let the disappointments let discouragement let other thing itself have come at different times and then it becomes a challenge to be able to commit because you have to be able to remove anything that is in between that we're not wanted that would it'll not allow you to be able to commit or submit yourselves to one another and you realize that even with that within a marriage it's not something that is just someone swooping down and removing but there must be the objective and the desire to see this middle wall of partition or to see that which is there dissolved you with me so it requires a continual sacrifice a continuum this is where Paul would say that we are to give our lives as a continual sacrifice unto the Lord this he helps us he brings us into this place of committal he brings us here he's a gentleman is that right he does not force himself he does not demand himself he's a gentleman so he must create the atmosphere that dismantles doubt fear worry dread he must he is the one to provide that is that right the Bible says in Psalms 23 regarding the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he goes through the entirety of the chapter and even into the verse he maketh me to lie down into green pastures that whole verse of scripture deals with the shepherd himself moving and where that there is an environment and an atmosphere where the sheep are at peace with one another and the Sheep are at rest with the Shepherd because he cannot make them lie down force them to but he must create the conditions that they themselves feel safe in order to lay down so it Christ himself it is him that not only is the author the finisher of our faith but even through the whole building it is him working in our lives that we are submitting to him I tell you what that just that just makes me want to shout it makes me just want to want to run because it's him that's working over our lives even for us to even have faith in a promise of God that you might need in your life yet God Himself here is up to him exclusively to create the conditions that are needed in order for those conditions to be met it requires him to come the scene if we could do it we wouldn't need him but we need him to come God's will as the Prophet puts it here God's will for us is perfection and that perfection is is patients which is waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development now you know to think of how God Himself so became one of us to where that God soul subjected himself to take upon a body of flesh that he created to come and dwell in and God would come and walk within that blood that body of flesh we know purpose for redemption but God moved and walked within that body of flesh and that body of flesh through the Lord Jesus he experienced everything that you and I experienced he experienced fear come on somebody he experienced temptation this was not an act that he went through he experienced this now remember God cannot be tempted so God had to so subject himself to take upon a body that he himself could experience what it was like for man to undergo temptation God was never tempted but God through this working in there in the office of his son how that God was able to so move within this that he might understand you and I and that through his glorious character to see the very perfection of the character of the Lord Jesus Christ it was not a gift it was a victory is that right but it was waiting on God and waiting for God he had there was a there was a purpose for him coming to this earth there was a purpose and within that purpose we we recognized that when we look at this statement I think of that the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering that this perfection that we look at it's a it's a complete submission I want you to think of this this submission when when God identified himself he identified himself as a dove when he identified his sign he identified his son as the lamb is that right one that was one that was of itself helpless in itself is that right Jesus said the son can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise now remember Jesus was pulled to change situations sometimes is that right he was pulled to change the situation there in the time of Lazarus truly was he spoke and remember they said the one whom thou lovest he was pulled to that but he he stood in the midst of that time and he was he did not try to change the situation's but look at his life his life was completely given over to what was it that the father wanted to be done and not just what but even when that's the will of God the will of God is not just one but the will of God also has within it the timing what is his timing so he's showing this of house now what what was back there now here we see coming before us this second Adam the second man Adam were watching this unfold and we're watching what we see is alive that is a life of complete perfect submission so when we look at this we look at in the midst of it that as he would say the Lord Jesus was not mute at all during his time here and in his earthly journey even within the midst of those three and a half years he was not mute concerning his what the purpose of his time and what it was for him coming here he knew that even John's ministry called out behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world was his future office has priestly office so he knew that in order for that he's author everything his whole journey I want you to catch this now he's in Jesus he knew who he was and he also with identified what his purpose was and that's what he lived in he lived in what the word had said of who he was and in everything here he is even after a great healing takes place he'll speak to them of how and show to them the Bible says of how the Son of Man should suffer after coming out of the out of out of a healing and he'll go right in and he's showing these things throughout the time with the disciples so he's clearly disclosing yet the disciples are not catching that we know that they're not catching this of what's going on but he's letting him know this is the suffering that's going to take place I want you to think of this the whole time when we look at it the Lamb himself had to be willing to go to Calvary it couldn't be drug to Calvary he had to be willing to go I want you to look at this here in has the time is drawing down in John 10 verse 17 look at these statements just so just tremendous it's just so illuminated to my heart therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again my father loves me because I lay down my life that I might take it again his life could not be taken from him he had to lay it down in order to take it again he had to lay it down he had to make a decision to lay his life down I hope you're with me now but that to lay his life down was not just something that was just could be done notice God even coming to if we can say it like this the apex of his purpose in walking here upon this earth God himself must create the conditions that will actually bring the into complete perfect submission to the fulfillment of the promise of the hour Oh glory be to God this is the parallel this is our parallel in this hour this was the son of man in this hour so it's the same working in the end in the body where the son of man himself is revealing his life to you and I what's this verse 18 no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down that's power he didn't it not all of these great miracles that were done but yet notice the purpose here all of the miracles all of those things we're clearly showing this was a man approved of God are you with me but yet notice the greatness of the authority the power that lay within his life was I have authority to lay my life down Oh glory be to God I tell you tonight that even when a when a seed yet not quicken but yet having a seed on the inside of potential you have within you the potential in the Spirit of God moves upon the life you have with it in it authority that's reading within there to say I received that authority to lay down my life and take up my cross and follow him the Spirit of God moving on you gives you authority you see how that God here in his bosom rested the authority to lay down his life and that's the same thing in our life it rests within our lives by the quickening power raising the seed to life lays the authority to lay our lives down I die daily I lay down daily and I have power look at this and I have power to take it again not only to lay it down but to take it up again this commandment have I received of my father Oh glory be to God we're watching this committing that it's taking place I want you to think of this he was he was ordained to this moment will you agree with that now let me take it another step will you agree that you're ordained for this moment yes you are but suddenly I don't feel but you're ordained for it you see listen it took the Spirit of God to quicken the promises to him you with me it took the Spirit of God coming to quicken the promises to him so he could stand and what he was speaking of the promises these were part of the promises that lay on the grounds that was a life to him he understood him at that time the disciples with him did not understand what he was speaking of but it was important that he understood he knew you see an understanding is that it had lifted him out of just this realm of where he was walking but here he was walking in the midst of them and in and through it he was ordained to this / no one else could have taken his place you agree with that no one else can take your place the same Spirit of God that moved upon him and the same authority what word speaks of the groom also speaks of the bride so they have that authority this is not just loose words friends but it's true that you and I might understand that having power to lay our lives down there is that which within our lives that the Spirit of God moving upon our life's not demanding but moving on our life literally draws out of us what he desires it doesn't force anything he draws it out of us it's committed to him no doubt you've been through circumstances I have maybe you're in tonight you have no idea how this is all gonna come out you have no idea how certain things are gonna work out you have no idea you don't know every little thing a little every little step of the way but what it brings you to brings me to is a place to where that we must commit ourselves unto the Lord and the whole situation what it is that we're trying to make sense of you know if there's things going around even in your mind or whatever more you have to commit that to the Lord and say Lord I give the battle to you Lord commit it into his hands and watch it in his hands watch him take control because you cannot make urine you're not made you're new you and I are not built to be able to try to handle these these these spiritual battles on our own the Bible says put on the whole armor of God whereby you might be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and don't just put it on you've got a shield raise that shield up and quench the fiery darts of the enemy take that sword that is given and cutting down you say how can I do that stand up on whom God has revealed to you that you are and standard you say how do I do that by the helmet of salvation that I know in whom I happy leave I know what he has done in me and then you look to the breastplate of righteousness to know that my heart desires they reflect him I only desire him you see what your glorying in is the armor that the chief captain has given you all it takes all it takes is just saying even in your heart right now you know I say I don't feel but just say in your heart because before you say this let me just ask you isn't he worthy listen he able hasn't he proven himself over and over he overthrew our unbelief he overthrew our doubt he overthrew all things that were against us then you can just say in your heart Lord I commit this to you I I give it to you because my worrying about it all of these things doubts and fears and things I committed to you and you know what you're doing you give it to him who's able to move on your behalf and he loves to do that because that's personal to you glory be to God your love no man taketh my life from me I want you to watch this how Peter picks this up in Acts chapter 2 verse 22 you men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you see he was a vessel you catch that God did by him how could God do this because he was a vessel he presented himself as a vessel there right as ye yourselves also know him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God well Judas betrayed him no he was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God God just allowed the pieces to come together to fulfill what was already in his mind you understand me the council is not something that's going on now but right now is the reflection of the council that already took place and let me tell you something that council that took place meeting has been adjourned for recess recess yes to come down and express myself and collect my attributes and come back home council has already been recessed so here Peter is letting it be known that you see you see how Peter resting within this this is also his own life as well that he's resting in the Living God as all of the believers on that you know what there is nothing that's gonna touch our lives until God says and their purpose is served come on home how is he looking at that because he's looking at the example we have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God has raised up and having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it it's hard not to hold still on those things in preach but we got to go on here two chapters later John 1227 the Lord Jesus says now is my soul trouble no I read to you two chapters before I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up again no man taketh it from me but in verse 27 here he says now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour and he says father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again save me from this hour but notice he sees he save me from this hour but for this hour came I aware of his purpose the in order to fulfill that purpose it requires full committal just like in the scripture mine my heart just went to this here and my Bible opens to it in John 17 verse 1 these words fake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven it said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son may also glorify thee O glory Peter God glorified let me read this I don't know I didn't include this this just this just came here as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him glorify thou me thy son that thy son may glorify thee so the glory of God notice here's God's glory to where that the son could so reflect the glory of God through a complete perfect submission none of us will disagree that he lived a submissive life is that right he lived a submissive life he followed he said that his desire upon this earth I came not to do mine own will he had a personal will are you with me but he says I came not to do mine own will you see Jesus here he understands what it's like when we are even looking and desiring to find God's perfect will for our lives he understands that because our own will can be pulled in a certain way even when we're approaching things of testing the trials and decisions of life he understands that that's why but as we go to him as our faithful high priest he knows and understands us and is able to minister to that and you realize this that it isn't even and what I say though I believe that we ought to go to him and bring our cares unto him because he said cast your cares upon me because I care for you but the Bible has placed me by his own spirit that same life within you and I is a mediator even within our lives he even knows what to pray for when we ourselves don't even know what to pray for is that right it's a spirit of intercession hey man we're not Ben we're not disconnected from our high priests but our high priests we are united with him it's committal notice in Hebrews five seven who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience was this very obedience is submission compliance by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and through all them that obey Him called of God and high priest after the order of Melchizedek aren't you glad that God became one of us oh my brother sister he knows exactly he knows exactly how to move for our hearts notice let's go to this in the garden in Matthew 26 verse 36 then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane and said unto the disciples sit ye here while I go yonder and pray and once she just to catch this here tonight I'm not gonna elaborate on this but notice his approach in the midst of this time I go yonder and pray I'm going to pray prayer to commune with his father you with me who was he who is he praying to he was praying to his father that dwelled within him fundamental foundation of faith when you pray in the name of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Jesus praying through you it's our high priest be the dog now watch this the verse 37 and he took with him Peter and two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy that phrase I've referred to it many times they were very heavy this is the apex of depression that's exactly what that phrase means in the Greek it's the height there's no other there's no greater depression than this right here very sorrowful sad why was he sad because he loved his disciples listen to me now he loved the fellowship with them he loved the sunrise and the sunset he loved those things but he realized that his left for them was greater than just a love that would stay here and just would remain that would not be able to help them so a deeper love is such a love that he now is committing himself to be willing to go this is this is the outworking of what was spoken I have power to lay my life down I'm not gonna ask you to raise your hands it's many times it's easy for us to speak promises that belonged to us but then when the actual moment comes when we're at the moment of that promise to be fulfilled remember listen that's when everything is set against you and to remember to remember that Satan is always there to try to upset at the verge of the fulfillment of the promise you try to tell you're not worthy you try to tell you it's enough for you he'll give all these other things but listen you can always discern his voice because his voice is a voice of condemnation I want you to think of this God Himself is not gonna honor a voice of condemnation even when you're seeking for a promise God Himself will not bring condemnation if there's anything that needs to be rain right he brings it to your heart with the desire that you will repent or relinquish from that right there and that the promise might be fulfilled God desires to fulfill hears word I don't think we can ever say that I don't think we can ever say that enough we are constantly bombarded with battle but I believe it's where within our hearts that through the maturing of the presence of God by his word is to bringing you an eye to the recognition of the voice and discerning that voice and withstanding it greater is He that is in you that he that's in the world you are not you are not the devil's punching bag no sir you have been made the head not the tail come on somebody even with that right there no matter how gloomy it could be you can say Amen no you may not be a a man tonight but right in your so you say Amen well you find that a man and that a man will start kicking up amen then maybe you know another day a man you know it's just it's picking up what what's that you have to start there's footsteps come on somebody there's footsteps are possession it has to start with this word and here is God ministering his word to lift you an in his promises my soul then he said unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me and he went a little further fell on his face and prayed o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt you know when I look at this he prayed this three times but let's just look at every every every time each time this is my opinion I'm not here to preach my opinion but I can say it like this if we can look at this scripture this right here in the latter part was the theme of his prayer you understand I'm saying I don't believe he just went and said and said I'll align oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my world thing will be done but he's in prayer he went to pray praise prayer is communion come on somebody right now this is not communion this is me speaking or the Lord speaking and you listening but when you get home maybe on your way home you're driving or tomorrow morning or whatever here you are you'll be communing with the Lord speaking to him he's speaking back to you prayer is communion but here there is a communing that's going on here's the purpose here's the height here's the fulfillment of his journey upon earth listen this right here is not about casting a devil out of somebody this part right here is not about one who was sick with a palsy raised up this right here it's not about one who was who was dumb and cast himself in the fire and was delivered this is not about that this is overcoming his self are you with me in order for this promise to come to fulfillment it's got to be a complete committal and here he is in prayer see this is showing you and I how is it when I'm going through a tense when I'm going through a trial when I've got a situation that I just cannot make heads or tails out of he's showing you and I this is how you approach it in prayer and every one of us every one of us this is how that we look at it Lord if it's possible take this trial away Lord nor if it's possible let this bad circumstance go away Lord if it's possible Lord is that right or below Samuel I don't pray to dodge and avoid and avoid trials you know what brother Ram said no I'm not interested in somebody just quoting me a quote we're not talking about being politically correct we're talking about our own will you know how brother BAM said it three kinds of believers Lord don't take the trials from me just give me the grace to go through it amen but you recognize that he himself had to be committed to that what about the examples with the tax case pressure came on come on somebody wants it to end come on somebody but you see within this this it all still comes down we understand that God bring it out to our hearts that there is no other way for us to receive or come to perfection and the molding of our character outside of trials but here's the good part he said I'll be with you here's the good part he said my grace is sufficient here's the wonderful thing is that he will bring forth out of our life what he knows is there as Paul could tell you and I these temporary afflictions prayed the third time but notice how he says in verse 45 he comes to them wakes him up you see they're sleeping this is not their time they're sleeping don't want somebody Polycarp and the rest I mean when Martin Luther when Martin Luther thought that time in Wittenberg that he was his time you weren't sleeping he was what praying come on he was praying he was communing behold the hours at hand and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us be going behold he is at hand that does betray me I want you to think of this how many times do you read in the scriptures where the Lord Jesus himself when they sought to come and take him he would slip up many times he would slip out he would slip out of the way now the one thing that we can look within that it wasn't the timing it wasn't the timing there are times that the Lord Jesus stood right there in the midst of the temple and spoke directly to them face-to-face and he called them to the word that they said they were living by and then there are other times when they would arise with questions the Bible said vehemently press upon him what did he do he went out well why did he do it like that because that's what the Father wanted the whole purpose of the coming was not to be able to disprove everybody was not to make everybody believers he came for his own that's the whole objective when he comes in every generation he does not come to make everybody in that generation a believer he does not come to try to disprove everybody no he comes for his own that's what he comes for Rhys let us be going it would I look at this here he could have he he could have went anywhere all of these places even where is that Gethsemane all these places are very very much set for who he is the purpose of his life worries that all of these things are purposely positioned I don't have time to go into that but I assure you I want you to see this is that he just he could have run from the situation but what gave him the strength to stand chapters before I read to you my soul is troubled read to you the very first part of this he's entering into this very sorrowful very heavy a height of depression but what's he doing with that he's taking it to this Father in prayer he's committing himself to his father brother Adam made this statement I didn't put this one on on there but I because I don't want to read the whole thing but brother Ram tells us of all the demons that gathered around there that moment to try to persuade him and remove him from the objective even Satan came upon Peter Andrew Peter said no Lord it shall not be and Jesus discerned it and said Satan gets out behind me thou art an offence to me what did he consider an offense anything that hindered the purpose of God's desire and will for his life anything he discerned it is that he dispensed a Peter that's my buddy that's a good guy Peter you know he loves me Peter would do anything for me no he discerned it at that moment and said thou art an offence it wasn't Peter you a Satan that was trying to get him to dodge remember Center like this and conferences I never heard him say like this before but he's talking of how that here God is speaking to him through the Sun he said the angels are listening so what's gonna be your result he said the whole world's laying on your shoulder do you want to pay the price or what do you want to do you can come right on now without death what do you want to do you can come on right now without death hello Moses was packed away Elijah was packed away come on somebody write all of this right here as he said he you could he could have come on right now without death but there would have been no redemption and that was his purpose his purpose was to bring Redemption our purpose is vessels that Redemption might be finished up my think of this the Bible says let me just skim over this here he was the scriptures already prophetically spoke in Isaiah 53 he opened not his mouth it already spoke of the character in their life this is what it will do open not his mouth were there pressures to open his mouth were there things that he could have I'm gonna defend myself I am going to I'm going to lay it all out what's he tempted sure he was the scriptures are emphatic to state to you and I he opened not his mouth the Bible tells us in Luke 23 that even while here he was going to Calvary on the cross I'm just going to mention to her a first the first few scriptures he says Harriet's crucified and here he is Father forgive them for they know not what they do he's living by his own word forgive them remember what he said remember he said if you and your life have told anything that when there's not forgiveness how that the mountain itself will not move God will not hear your prayer here is the great test in the midst of this time he's being railed upon he's been reviled if you're the son of God come off the cross and prove yourself and you've got all sort and you've got all power you see it was not this was not easy as a matter of fact he opened not his mouth it was the whole atmosphere was contrary to where that this was something easy it was not easy but what policy able to do this not because listen to me now not because he was virgin born he was able to do this because the lamb had come to a place of such submission to the Heavenly Father he trusted him you know what I'm saying in the book of Psalm 69 because thou trusting me my darling he trusted him to walk into death he trusted him he has in my head that word was quickened to his life destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again they derided him they mocked him even even to malefactors one of the malefactors even speaks to him the same thing railing on him if thou be the Christ come down off the cross and save us but there's one that guy might have been the biggest robber and biggest sinner within the village everybody might have known that guy is a biggest Reber and everything else and everything but what they didn't know was the last conversation they didn't know the closing moments this was arranged God had arranged this here was his lamb he was the Lamb of God they're hanging o Calvary and here this man at that time it wasn't that God inspired him the robber do whatever he did but God permitted it why here he is in position to be able to testify after Pilate has said I find no fault in you after the rest of them said this man Herod said this man I don't find any fault in him and here stands one of the malefactors that said this man has not done anything to deserve this you might go week after week month after month in the workplace and it might seem like everybody's against you it's a spirit but God's standing for you God will have somebody to stand up and testify you with me gotta have somebody stand up and give witness and give testimony yes sir oh my lord I don't know where time goes this wood preacher away but it's so wonderful brother BAM tells it like this in identification I'm closing he tells in the message identification of how that Satan could list then there and look and say this this can't be God manifested in flesh taking whippings like this can't be you see what Satan has saw is God's creative power he's watched God be able to move on the scene when Satan had stirred up Pharaoh's army to chase him and he's witnessed of how that God has come on the scene and drowned them all but all those things were all types cuz every one of those was Satan being allured into an ambush Satan still didn't catch it this right here where he's looking at I don't have to how can this be hit they're saying this and he's not saying nothing about it he's not doing anything it can't be ambushed he's never seen this displayed in this manner hamana brother branham said it like this I want you to listen this now he said Satan was watching at that he put a rag over his face soldier smote him in the head with a stick then passed it one to another said now if you can see these visions if you be a prophet tell us who hits you and he never look at this he never opened his mouth you believe he could have told him who was hitting him I believe so I believe he could have told him where you live I believe he could have told him what they just done but he never opened this mouth you know why he wasn't gonna clown for them there were times he opened his mouth and there's times he bitten open his mouth I want you to watch what the Prophet saying here he never opened his mouth Satan said that can't be the Son of God it just can't be he wouldn't put up with that but sons of God put up with anything as long as they know they're doing the will of God and that's what he come to do criticism whoo sons of God put up any by like criticism I'm glad nobody raised your hand I'm gonna call you a liar in here nobody likes criticism is that right but here was criticism constantly the Bible said he was despised and rejected of men now watch how brother man goes the very next code after this now with our message can we stand by the looking glass of God's Word and see Christ reflect in our own lives then can we bear such and the reproach of the message that we're standing for someone can say something about it and yet you just don't open your mouth and say nothing about it why would you not open your mouth because he never opened his mouth under send me Jesus was not interested in their blog post these are not interested in their YouTube videos he's got a purpose to serve who probably puts it in another place for the message he said Jesus was so focused on the purpose of God for his life he ignored the criticism Oh God let us be so caught in the purpose of God for our life because through that we receive strength to look above criticism he was an example prophet said have we sons and daughters of God God reflects his character in us then we become like him oh he said that's my desire I think that's every believers desire is to become more like him now there's no doubt about it that all around us here myself included there's times we've opened our mouth when we shouldn't have the Bible says when he was reviled he reviled not back the Bible says that there was no guile found in his mouth it wasn't that he it wasn't that well he didn't open his mouth he didn't say no there wasn't anything within him there wasn't anything within him look brother Samuel that's completely impossible I agree with you when it comes to us flesh and blood but here right here on this earth right here walking in a body like our own body he committed himself he committed himself but some how do I overcome that commit it to the Lord go to one the latter quotes I I'm gonna read this before I want to read this before we pray life story it's right after Psalms 91 life story if someone talks about you and you talk back about them God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself and watch these words this is this is clear just let loose and let him do it just let loose and let him do it and just commit it we can worry about it we can even stew about it week we can we can all of those things can remain listen friends those things can remain within us but this is where just let loose how do I let loose how can I let loose first of all you have to make a separation from it and recognize it this is a fault this is laying in me that's that's part it that's where it starts because what you're doing you're now distancing you you're seeing this for what it is you're just letting loose now you can let him come and say Lord remove this Lord I commit to you the RAM says that's the greatest weapon that I know of of a Christian today is a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it you've been there maybe there tonight when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him but some you don't understand no I have to commit things to him too and I've had to but you know even and coming to that I've said this over and over I don't want to just approach something and say well this is what the word says and just say it but I want to say Lord this is what you're calling me to help me to commit to you even if you realize what what what this is a need ask him to create the conditions to move so that the committing comes that submitting comes that cleansing comes just commit it to him look at this God will take care who will God will God will take care of it not you and God not me and God God will take care of it you've done your part committing it to him you know you take something you committed it took a promise whatever it whatever it might be and you take that and you commit it to the Lord in prayer but the brem tells it like this and this is how we can apply it across every part of our life he said it's just like was the need for healing in your body he said in a committal a committal says lord I accept your healing for my body and he says from that from that very thing he says you he said here's what you must do surrender yourself entirely to Christ and surrender your mind to his word and he says say this Lord I won't act upon my own feelings upon my own thoughts I will only act upon your word I'll have no control of my own thoughts concerning it I will act that's a committal when symptoms arise feelings arise things that arise against what I stand on your word you see you can come out of the service out of the service here and I want you to what I want you to see you come out of it the devil's gonna be waiting whether it's tomorrow whatever more but don't look at that and say huh it was just all elevated no Simon now you said no but what I'm trying to show you is is that as he stands there to try to bring up the symptoms you stand there and say the Lord's healed me you don't matter if it's physical or it's emotional spiritual meaning God sealed mine and you stand there on that word that's a committal to the Lord any feeling anything that arises anything that through the midst of that trial or that test you stand up on that committal whatever it is that you're facing committed to him say lord help me help me Lord to commit it to you you see the Lord Jesus himself here he was he was going through a test he was coming into the greatest trial but he didn't approach it casually and same ordained for this he felt the pressures the committal was his soul where his life could be so submitted into the hands of God I hope you understand this Jesus never had to take a xanax to go to Calvary I'm not putting anything down on this I want you to understand God so moved upon his life to where he never had to take a downer or an upper or anything it's so moved him to a place of submission the reason I say that is not for you to be focused on medication I say that so that you might understand he who is the God of all peace will give you the peace to submit to what word that he drops upon your heart it will not be something where you have to be anxious the Bible says be careful for nothing be anxious for nothing just resting isn't he wonderful he's faithful Church he's faithful he knows your need he knows my need and you know he's here to minister to us let's pray anybody like to be remembered in prayer tonight Heavenly Father or do you see throughout the building Lord Jesus the needs of your children we all Lord stand in need of you father as you spoke so clearly to us tonight the committing of ourselves to you we see the example that's been laid out before us and we realize more that it's the submitting of our self our will to your will Lord we're thankful that you are ever-present Lord to help us we think back to that scripture I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up again lord I pray may Lord this be truly the focus to realize the potentials all that you have ordained it lays within that seed all that we have to do is drink and drink and stay in the presence of the sou and all that you have placed and ordained in our life it comes forth Lord I pray God tonight for these needs the hands that's behind it Lord some without facing trials some Lord that may be right in the midst Lord some just coming out of it Lord in their heart right now Lord the desire of where they're at is Lord I just want to commit this to you Lord committing the whole situation committing Lord the whole trial committing Lord everything into your hands myself Lord myself all of my feelings all of my thoughts I commit him to you know not ignoring him not denying him I commit them to you I place some Lord into your hands Lord Jesus I give him over to you Lord I commit myself to you Lord Jesus father believing that that same life is in me and Lord Jesus to where you're able to lead us as lambs of God Lord forgive us when we've opened our mouth and we shouldn't have opened it Lord Jesus you've never we're never Lord to be in a place to where we are to have to clown for the devil never but Lord let our lives just be submitted to you then your glory might be made manifest help us Lord that in our lives the Lord that we can be completely committed to you to thank Lord that Lord Jesus here were standing in this moment as a people of God that I believe tonight that I'm looking at him and I'm one of of people that'll not have to taste death the Lord will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Lord to think of that promise it takes Lord a complete committal and to realize Lord that you provide what is needed in order for that committal to come forth in our lives Lord Jesus what an atmosphere as you did in the beginning you spoke your word an atmosphere begin to move upon this earth it changed by your word and Lord you're changing us and transforming us Lord by your word Lord as your spirit is moving behind the word oh thank you Lord Jesus mayor just Lord give strength Lord encouragement
