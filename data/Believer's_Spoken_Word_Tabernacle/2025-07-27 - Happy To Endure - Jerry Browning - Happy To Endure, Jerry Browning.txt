It's good to be here with you this morning. Thankful to have my uh wife with me, Mina. And uh we've got four of the grandkids. There's Theodore and Jethro and Roselina. And Michael's over here. And then I brought my piano player with me today. And this is my daughter Lydia Rose. And so uh I want to I want to sing a song. I've I've uh we sing it at our church down there in Dixon. And and I've never actually sung it as a solo before. So you just bear with me. But the song has a lot of meaning to me. It was like yesterday. I was praying for a miracle. Scared to have a little hope. And now looking back, seeing all the things you've done, I can't even add them up. 1 2 3 up to infinity. I run out of numbers before I can thank you for everything. God, I'm still counting my blessings. All that you done in my life. The more that I look in the details, the more of your goodness I'll find. Father, on this side of heaven, I know that I'll run out of time, but I will keep counting my blessings, knowing I can't count that high. And I know that seasons never last forever. So God, I'll remember all of the reasons my heart has to be grateful. All of the times you've been faithful to me. God, I'm still counting my blessings. all that you done in my life. The more that I looked in the details, the more of your goodness I'll find. Father, on this side of heaven, I know that I'll run out of time, but I will keep counting my blessings. Oh, when I can't count that high. I can't count that high. [Laughter] No, I can't count that high. One, two, three, up to infinity. I run out of numbers before I could thank you for everything. But God, I'm still counting my blessings. All that you done in my life. The more that I look in the details, the more of your goodness I'll find. Father on this side of heaven. I know that I'll run out of time, but I will keep counting my blessings. Know when I can't count that high. Oh no, I can't count that high. [Music] Thank you. and uh I think I think you'll see that after the message today if you stand with me I I want to read my text from James chapter 5 7-11 I know that I know I gave I know that I gave my testimony. Excuse me. I'm still crying from the song. It's just it's just bubbling over, brothers. I know I already gave my testimony up here back in April of 2024 of how God had healed me from the mental illness, but uh you know, he healed me then, but you know, like many things, even you know, when you have surgery in the natural, there's a time of recovery. &gt;&gt; There's a time of being restored. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so now I I want to maybe go into it a little more than I did before, preach to you and go into that testimony because now I'm not just healed, I'm restored. &gt;&gt; And uh I just I want to share this with you if I can just in some way be a help. Now I know that my testimony is about the mental illness that I suffered with, but this is the thing, friends, about faith. It doesn't matter here this morning. No matter what you got going on in your life, I don't care. It don't have to be mental illness. God is the Lord our God that healthth all of our diseases. But he not only health all of our diseases, he he is the Lord our God that provideth all of our needs. So whatever you got need of this morning, you reach out to him and God will meet that need. Amen. Now, if you read with me James 5, verse 7, I want to title this this morning because it's a personal testimony. Happy to endure. &gt;&gt; Happy to endure. &gt;&gt; Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he received the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord drawth nigh. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned. Behold, the judge standeth before the door. Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering, affliction, and of patience. Behold, we count them happy which endure. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy. Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. You know there we don't all it isn't all the same reason for each person one of us of why God has each one of us maybe the things that we go through &gt;&gt; uh meaning you know there there are intimate intricate details that God is dealing with with you personally. It's a personal walk between you and God. &gt;&gt; So, so God, friends, look, this isn't just a, you know, a thing we can just throw a whole blanket over it all and it fits everybody. But what does fit is that where God is bringing us from and where he's taking us to. &gt;&gt; We all know that what God is preparing us for. He's preparing each and every one of us. This is the preparation time. This is where God prepares us at here in this life in this walk on this earth during time and this season. And God chose for you and I to be in this season, this time. And not only that, but God God gets even more specific. God has you in a certain location, a certain region, a certain area, a certain country. You know, God, he he actually brought you here. Maybe you can, you know, you maybe you can you're bilingual or or something or can speak different languages. God had a purpose in all that. He wanted you to be who you are. &gt;&gt; But God is working out in our lives preparing us here for what is to come. &gt;&gt; This is not our life. And many times we get so absorbed into what's going on in this life and what and so what it does we we begin then Satan can really battle us there. &gt;&gt; But the things that God has us go through, it's all for for molding our character. &gt;&gt; We we know that there's a rapture coming. We know we're going in a rapture. We know there's a marriage supper of the lamb. We're looking forward to that. We're looking forward to a a span of about three and a half years of enjoying ourselves at the marriage supper of the lamb. We're actually looking forward to a period of about 40 days prior to that of the dead in Christ rising and us reuniting with our loved ones and and believers and friends that we've carried and walked here with in on this earth. And we're looking forward to that, you know. and and then oh but that's not the end of it yet. Then we know we got to come back down here in the after the the end of the marriage supper and we've got to rule and reign on this earth for a thousand years of time of a millennium. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In order to rule in the millennium you got to know how to rule now. So God has us go through things. We have to endure them in order that God is molding us and preparing us for that time. &gt;&gt; But there are things that God has us go through and endure to help our fellow brothers and sisters as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are things when you look in look at when Paul I mentioned Thursday night when God called Paul, he he's he spoke and he told said, "I'm going to show him what things he must suffer for my name's sake." You know, sometimes you read that and you think that that means that because you're being persecuted for believing in Jesus. It's not just that. For his name's sake, who is his name's sake? You are his people, his bride. You are his name's sake. So there are times that we have to suffer as believers, as individuals, endure and go through things for his name's sake, &gt;&gt; for one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; If Paul had not suffered for his name's sake, then how could have Paul known how that Christ suffered? How could Paul have known how to so intricately write to the churches about faith? &gt;&gt; And how could he write about Abraham? You know what Paul says about Abraham? Let's just read it. Hebrews chapter 6 verse 10. For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name in which he have ministered to the saints and to minister. And we desired that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope and to the end. that you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherited the promise. For when God had made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, multiplying I will multiply thee. And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. He did not obtain it before he endured. He had to endure. Do you know what? Listen, friends. Do you know what endure means? It means to hold fast. &gt;&gt; It means to not waver. It means to be able to persevere and you're going to make it through. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, &gt;&gt; if if you weren't faced with adversity, if you weren't faced with with things that was telling you, actually screaming to your flesh to give up, &gt;&gt; then you wouldn't be enduring. You got to have that in order to endure. There's got to be something to endure. &gt;&gt; If there's nothing to endure, then you're not enduring. Hallelujah. You You There's got to be things you're going to face. &gt;&gt; We look, do we enjoy it? No. We're If we look at it through our flesh and how it makes our flesh feel, we're not enjoying it. But I'll tell you, friends, if God can open your eyes and you can see a bigger picture of what God's doing, you're going to be happy to endure it. When you get on the other side and you see the benefit not only to yourself but the benefit to others, you're going to be able to stand there and say, "I am happy to endure." &gt;&gt; I am happy I have endured. I am happy to continue to endure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul speaks about in Timothy, he said that he has suffered many persecutions and afflictions and and things and he said uh uh he said I endured and he says but out of them all the Lord delivered me. &gt;&gt; The Lord heals deliver us. &gt;&gt; Amen. David says in Psalms 103, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, forget not all his benefits. Who forgive who forgiveth all of thine iniquities." Can you say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Who healthth all thy diseases, that's a lis. Friends, look, I I've listened to the messages and prayer lines and things. I have heard brother Brennham call people out of the audience and say, "You've got allergies you're suffering from. God heals you." We think about that and we think that's just a a little insignificant thing in comparison to cancer or something else. But God heals all of your diseases. He can heal the smallest one. He can heal the greatest one. There is no disease, no demon or devil can stand before God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Praise your God. &gt;&gt; But not only stand before God, if you'll grab a hold by faith and claim that it's you, friends, listen, he's the God of your profession. What you profess, God backs it up. If you will profess his word, by his stripes, I am healed. And &gt;&gt; let me tell you something, friends. You don't got to wait to testify once you've got your healing. You don't got to wait to testify once you've got your deliverance. You don't have to wait to testify once the the issue, problem, or trial that's going on in your life has been resolved. &gt;&gt; You can testify right in the middle of it. Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this as he talks about David said, "Did you ever get anointed in the presence of of your enemy?" He's referring to David. And you know, we're all familiar with that that 23rd Psalm. You know, and David says, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want." Hallelujah. Why? Why shall David not want? Because he is Jehovah Rah, &gt;&gt; the Lord is shepherd. Hallelujah. He's David knows he I'm in God's hands. &gt;&gt; Friends, David endured many things before he got down to write this in the book of Psalms. &gt;&gt; God built things up. Maybe that David maybe it started out with just the bear of the lion, but the next thing you know it was Goliath. [Music] And David just went back to his experience, &gt;&gt; the faith that he could draw from his experience with his walk with God. &gt;&gt; And he could stand there and face something greater than a bear or a lion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you know that Goliath came down there and Goliath tormented them? He Goliath came down there and he he actually tried to antagonize them for 40 days. I believe it was &gt;&gt; every morning coming down there and just trying to taunt them. &gt;&gt; David comes down and he's wondering what are y'all afraid of? &gt;&gt; He wasn't He didn't have any armor. He wasn't trained like them. They were trained. They had armor. Even his brothers was there trained. Had shields and swords and helmets and all these things. And listen friends, for 40 days, brother David, they were standing out there be letting Goliath stand there and taunt them. &gt;&gt; Why? because they didn't have faith &gt;&gt; in the God who had showed them time and time again that he always delivered them, that he always healed them, that he always provided for them. &gt;&gt; Oh, how dare I stand there like they were &gt;&gt; before before the demons and devils of the day. Let's don't be like them. Let's be like David. It ain't about me. It's not about how big I am. It ain't about how strong I am. It's not my about my abilities. It's about the God I serve. &gt;&gt; David wasn't talking about just when he mentioned the bear and the lion, David wasn't referring to his abilities. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; David said, "God delivered me out of the hand of the bear. He delivered me out of the balls of a lion. &gt;&gt; He says, "And that same God will deliver this uncircumcised Philistine into my hand." &gt;&gt; That's what that's what we got standing before us. That's that's how the devil is today, &gt;&gt; friends. He's a big bluff. &gt;&gt; But now you can't bluff him back. &gt;&gt; You have got to have real true faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember them people that in the in the old New Testament went down there and they were saying they were coming in the name of Jesus. They were calling coming in the name of Paul trying to cast out them demons. &gt;&gt; The devil said Jesus we know. &gt;&gt; Paul we know but who are you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But David come out there before Goliath. He said, "Who are you to stand here and defy the armies of the living God?" &gt;&gt; David knew God and he knew faith in God and he knew what God was capable of. &gt;&gt; David didn't know how. He didn't have to know how. David didn't try to figure it out. He didn't say, "Hold on a minute. I got to sit down and do some trigonometry to figure out how in the world this rock is going to kill that guy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me scientifically study this through. &gt;&gt; Maybe I need to get a doctor out here and consult him and know just where to hit him at. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; His faith was in &gt;&gt; the great physician. &gt;&gt; You know, we look at the great physician and we think, well, because he's a Lord our God that heals all of our diseases. But here was a disease standing before Israel that day. A disease that took the form, it was a spiritual disease. &gt;&gt; That took the form of a giant &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; David said, "Look, he's the great physician. He knows exactly where that rock's got to hit him." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How How is David going to get that much force behind? I'll tell you what, let me just drop a little thing to you. give you a lure of money if you don't remember it. My daddy was preaching on this years and years ago and he said, "I don't," he says, "I believe that that rock was ordained so much so to kill that giant that if David would have slung it the other way, it had just circled the globe and came back around and killed him." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It wasn't about David's ability or David's aim. It was about what he believed in God. It was about God's ability. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; David said, "Yeah, he resto my soul. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow, death, thou fill no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me. In the presence of my enemies, thou anointest my head with oil, and my cup runth over." Brother said, "You ever get anointed in the presence of your enemy?" You know who our enemy is today? The devil. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Spirit come and you. I don't care what your sickness is. I don't care what your problem is. I don't care if it's family drama. I don't care what it is. I don't care if it's a devil trying to bring you doubt that your family won't be safe. I'm telling you today, you stand there and say, "God, it's in your hands. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get anointed in the presence of Look, you don't get, like I was saying, you don't got to wait &gt;&gt; to testify &gt;&gt; after the fact. &gt;&gt; Abraham testified before he ever had the son. &gt;&gt; Abraham and Sarah were testifying &gt;&gt; as they were still growing older and older and older in their bodies. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God will bring Listen friends, you testify of God's fa word. You testify of your faith and God will bring it all around to be subject to that. &gt;&gt; Look, look at that. We're familiar with the story. Brother Brandham talks about John Ryan &gt;&gt; being blind. &gt;&gt; Friends, he didn't wait till he could see to say, "I can see." He by faith believed that the prophet of God had prayed for him. You know, now here's the whole story of John Ryan. John Ryan, you know, he was kind of raised Catholic, brother Bram said. He said, so he said, I prayed for him. Said he went around, went off platform, and he just got back in and came on back up. &gt;&gt; He said, "Come back around." He said, "I already prayed for you." He said, "I realized that that he was Catholic. He needed something to hold on to." &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; And so he told him, he says, "Look, you'll go off of here." He says, "And you just keep claiming, by his stripes, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; So John Ryan left off of there, friends, and and every day he kept proclaiming, "By his stripes, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; He he passed out newspapers on the corner. Y'all know the story. He passed out newspapers on the corner. You know, this back in the day, a whole lot different than internet stuff. And he's on the corner with these newspapers, "Extra, x-ray. Read all about it. By his stripes, I'm healed. I'll tell you what, friends, his testimony and profession, it went around that town so much that there was people that was making fun of him over it because they knew he couldn't see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Remember the story? He goes into the barber shop. He's in there and and the barber, you know, is going to try to torment him. &gt;&gt; Just send your best out against me. Like Goliath said, &gt;&gt; he's going to torment me. says, "Hey, John, can you see?" He knew good and well. John couldn't see. But but John knew he could see. &gt;&gt; He knew by faith. &gt;&gt; And John said, "Yes, I can see. By his stripes, I'm healed." He had that that barber's apron on and everything. You know, at that time, hallelujah, his God come down and make good on his profession &gt;&gt; of faith. And when he did, his eyes opened. Up out of that barber chair, he ran down the street he went. Barber apron, just the flapping, the barber running after him. Hallelujah. He was praising God, shouting the victory. I'll tell you this, John Ryan at that time, if you'd asked him, he would have told you, "I'm happy to have endured &gt;&gt; because his faith, his testimony still touches you today." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; After you endure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul says in Hebrews, hold fast to your profession. &gt;&gt; Hold fast. That's what endure means. To hold fast. Take a hold of it. Hold on to it. &gt;&gt; Don't let it go. Hold fast to your profession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hold fast to your profession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let let me read this quote. I don't know did if y'all got all those from the resurrection of Lazarus. And brother Random starts this out. He's talking about Mary. All right. It's talking about Mary. Notice she took him at his word. God said she's going to have a baby. Told it by an angel. That was good enough for her. Anyway, way she went testifying, telling people she was going to have a baby before there was any sign of anything. She had the word of God. That's good enough. That's good enough for me this afternoon. If he's Jehovah Raphael, the the healer, if he promised to heal me, I'll take him at his word. If he promised me the Holy Ghost was to me, I'll stay there till it comes. That's all. That's right. He promised it. Stay with it. I'll just take him at his word. I'll stay right there. That's the only way to do it. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just start testifying, friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will bring it all around to meet your testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's faith. Look, it's faith in his word. If he said it, this is what brother said. If he said it, I believe it. And that settles it. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That settles it. You've got to to in order for it to be settled with you, you've got to be willing to endure because Satan is going to be there to try to talk you out of it every day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're going to have some of Job's comforters. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; There'll be points say, "Hey, maybe there's something wrong in your life. You got some secret sin somewhere. Job knew he didn't. You have heard of the patience of Job. James said, "Count them happy which endure." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After Abraham had patiently, Hallelujah. Endured. Amen. All right. I think I got this down here. He swore by himself as the message says. So after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. Can you do the same thing this morning? Can you set your faith and say, "It's thus sayeth the Lord." And no matter what comes or what goes, whether today is easy or tomorrow's hard, can we do that? Can we set our faith and say, "Look, I'm not going to look at the circumstances. I'm not going to look how long this is going on." Hallelujah. Friends, do you realize that it takes more faith for divine healing than it does for a miracle? You know why? Because faith for divine healing is enduring faith. &gt;&gt; There's many people who had come through to prayer lines actually had miracles performed on their lives that walked away and never followed the truth. &gt;&gt; Remember what Jesus said? He said he he he says this verses. He says what he was concerned with was when he would return to earth would he find faith. &gt;&gt; And then he said this, he who endures not just for a little while, not just one trial, not just one year, not just a few years, but he that endures to the end, &gt;&gt; the same shall be saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, you can't quit a race in the middle and think you're going to win. &gt;&gt; Now, look, we're we're not in we're we're we're all in this race, but we're not actually in this race competing against one another &gt;&gt; to see who gets there first. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Because we've got some that's already made it. &gt;&gt; You know, let me give you this little testimony just popped in here. When I was going through basic training, at the end of the basic training, we had this uh uh it was a some kind of a test we had to go through and they called it Paragon Trail is what they called it. It was over in Fort Dicks, New Jersey. And what they did was they took us out by squads and just dumped us out there in the middle of nowhere over there in New Jersey. And so we're out in the woods, you know, and you're by squads, right? So you know what a squad is? just a a small group of soldiers with one guy that's leading those group of soldiers, right? And so, you know, four squads make a a platoon and four platoon make a company and so many companies make a, you know, a battalion and so many battalions make a brigade and so on and so forth. But here, break it all the way down. This is just one step above the individual, &gt;&gt; a squad, &gt;&gt; right? It's actually what they used more to fight with in in in Vietnam was by squads. Anyway, so they dropped us out there with squads. And so we're out there and so all these different squads are out, brother Roco. And they dropped us off in different areas and we and we got a map &gt;&gt; and it's dark &gt;&gt; and we got a map. And I'm not talking about a road map because there ain't no roads. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a top a topographical map. So you got to look at terrain. You got to know how to read a compass. You gota You got to know how to shoot a asthmas. You got to know what you're doing or you you will never get out of there. And we all had to make it to the same place. All the squads had to make it to the same place. They might have started out at a different point, a different region, but they all had one place, one goal, one end of the line. Now, there was some of us, our squads made it through. And you know, when we got there, at the very end of it, that's when it got worse because then we had this like it was set up like a battlefield and we had to load crawl across this thing with live rounds being fired over the top of us and they were throwing gas out at us and things. So, you had to get your gas me back on and and you're crawling and dragged. You can't leave none of your gear behind. You leave your gear behind, you're going back after it. And you can't leave you can't leave your buddy behind either. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, we go through all this and and but let me get to my point. So, you know, there was those of us that we made it through and there was still yet more to come. And so, they put us up. They had these bleachers, brother Roco. And so, we're up in these bleachers. And at this bleachers, we could look back over the banister of time down on the battlefield. And we could see the other squads of soldiers making their way across that battlefield toward us and we could witness it. We couldn't do anything for them. But you know what we started singing? We started singing encouragement to those on the battlefield that they could make it too. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That is so good. us up in them bleachers in the natural was a testimony to them. They made it through. Friends, we know we got loved ones. We got believers even out of this assembly we know made it through and they're on the other side. But you know what? They left behind their testimony that says you can do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No matter how bad it gets to looking, don't quit. &gt;&gt; No matter how bad you feel, don't quit. &gt;&gt; In the army, we had people that would go on a 10mi run every Friday in Germany. And it wasn't flat land either. And we go on a 10-mi run. Our our our platoon sergeant, he called it touring the town. Went on a 10 mile run every Friday morning, &gt;&gt; you know. And there was people the first little twinge in their legs or something, y'all. I think some of them never felt nothing. They just didn't have the desire to do it. &gt;&gt; And they would begin to fall out. Soon as they found a place they thought they could be inconspicuous about falling out and walking back, they did. But others, you know, they go on maybe a little bit longer. They feel the pain and then they'd be over the side limping and and they'd be over there, you know, and then they'd say, "I just quit." And they go back. I'll tell you something, friends. If you know anything about running, you're gonna feel some burn. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You're gonna feel a little bit of pain. &gt;&gt; You know, the army, of course, they mentally condition us. No pain, no gain. &gt;&gt; I can feel it in my legs. I can feel it in my arms. I can feel it in my my hands. But I'm keep going on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I'll tell you what. It's great to get anointed in the presence of the enemy and feel that in your legs. Feel that in your arms. Feel that in your soul. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't drop out. I don't care how painful it gets. I don't care how impossible it seems. I don't care. You say people tell me, "Well, I've been hearing ever since I was a kid that we're at the end time and the Lord is coming. &gt;&gt; It ain't never happened." Well, the Bible talks about that, too. Said people would get to where they'd say, "The Lord delayeth his coming, &gt;&gt; so let's just fall out. Let's just go live however we want. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible talks about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, this ain't time to quit. That's right. &gt;&gt; Our trials of health and our trials of of of you you know uh finances or our trials in life. Friends, when you look at them in retrospect of the whole picture, you will find out they're really not that big. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Here some time ago, brother Tommy, where you at? There some time ago, you know, I preached and I bringing out about the the Holocaust and about what they did to the Jews and and all that. I preached at my church, you know, right? And I said, "Listen, next time you feel like complaining over something's going on in your life, think about them." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I went through the whole thing in history. I laid it out. I had pictures of everything. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Somebody always has it worse than you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look, friends. Yeah, I'm not against us get down and crying out to God for oursel, but sometimes we get so self-centered, &gt;&gt; so self-involved, &gt;&gt; don't get so focused on yourself. &gt;&gt; You got other brothers and sisters. We're all in the same race. Pray for one another. That's right. &gt;&gt; Be there for one another. Be encouraging. &gt;&gt; You know how you can be encouraging? Don't wait till you get healed. Don't wait till you get delivered. They see you going through the things. &gt;&gt; I know many times we go through things and we keep it hidden. Maybe a lot of people around they don't know everything they're going through. Get up and testify about it. &gt;&gt; You can get up and say, "I'm going through hell right now. &gt;&gt; But I know I know my redeemer liveth. I know he's going to deliver me. I know that in the last day I shall see God. &gt;&gt; I know I'm going to make it through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't let God torment you about your children and your loved ones. Look, I'm not going to give you a bunch of false hope and I'm not going to get into this because, you know, gets into doctrine and teaching everything. But here's what I want to tell you. Just put it in God's hands. &gt;&gt; Come on now. put it in God's hands cuz Satan just wants to torment you about it. &gt;&gt; There ain't nothing you can do about it. You did. You can't die for them. You can't save them. Only one can do that. &gt;&gt; And you can't accept it for them. They got to do that for themselves. It's on a free moral agency. It's free will. &gt;&gt; So all you can do pray for them and commit it to God. I know God's able. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan torment you with how bad it looks like, how far it looks like they're going. Don't let Satan torment you about that. You just stand there and hold the standard. &gt;&gt; Standard of faith is in God's hands. Listen friends, the scripture says it'll be so close in at at the end that it would deceive the very elect if possible. &gt;&gt; All right. So here, you know, many times we focus on it's going to be so close and we start focusing, you know, brother rock on what's exactly does that mean? How close is it? Let's focus on this. &gt;&gt; It can't deceive the elect. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot stop God from saving one of his kids. &gt;&gt; It cannot deceive the elect. Jesus said, "All that the father has given me, I have them, and I'm not losing one." &gt;&gt; Satan ain't got no power. [Applause] Listen friends, as long as the devil can remain hidden. Remember what I told you about? Maybe you like, "Well, nobody knows what I'm going through." Don't let that devil remain hidden. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; As long as he he don't want you to testify about it. He don't want you to tell I'm not talking about going and belly aching, &gt;&gt; singing your woes. As brother Juel for says, "Wowsy, wowy woo. Woe is me." I'm not talking about that. But you can tell people, hey, look, I am really going through it. And it is very discouraging right now. If you want to get into a little bit of the details, if they got time, you know, just take this in a nut. Sometimes people ask you how you doing, they don't really want to know. &gt;&gt; If you don't want to know how somebody's doing, don't ask them. &gt;&gt; If you ain't going to hang around to hear the rest of the story, then don't ask them to start it out. Because look, the devil's already got them feeling like nobody cares about them. He's already got them feeling like they're all alone. &gt;&gt; I never do this. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to have to Excuse me. I don't believe that doctrine. Sorry. I don't think my dad ever wore long sleeve shirts. Hallelujah. Testify. Hallelujah. Testify. &gt;&gt; Believe it. Stand there in faith and testify. Hallelujah. Somebody ask you, do you want to share whatever? Testify. You know why? Because the devil you you're just throwing in his face. He wants you to feel like you're all alone. He wants to get you out there and feel all alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul says this in Philippians 4 and 6. Be careful for nothing. &gt;&gt; Be careful for nothing. You know what that means? It means don't worry. &gt;&gt; Here, let me just let's read this. Philippians 4:es 6 and 7. You might like this, you might not. I hope you don't get offended. Be careful for nothing. But in everything be pray be in prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, letting your requests be known before unto God. Now, first of all, difference between prayer and supplication. Prayer that's that's your ongoing Christian walk with God. You're you're communicating with him. Your supplications are your requests, the things you need. Hallelujah. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. What is Paul saying here? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Be careful for nothing. Don't worry. What's he saying here? And the peace of God which passes all understanding will keep your hearts and mind through Jesus Christ. Be happy. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Be happy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think you can remember that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Quit worrying. That's what the devil wants you to because friends, if you're worried, it brings fear and fear tears down anything that faith could be rested upon. &gt;&gt; You cannot be afraid and have faith at the same time. &gt;&gt; You know, let's just give you example. I'm sure you can relate to. So, uh, you know, let's say that, uh, some kind of unknowing bump. All of a sudden, you don't know it, but you feel all of a sudden you feel this unknowing bump. I didn't have that there before. The world's go rolling around and what in the world is that? &gt;&gt; Devil goes, it's cancer. It's a tumor. You're going to die. &gt;&gt; And if we ain't careful, we'll start running down that. We We'll actually look it up. We'll Google it. or a great or if you're an apple, jump on Safari or whatever and we'll we'll search that thing out and we'll diagnose ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's what the devil wants you to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's times when it needs to be diagnosed so it can be took care of and treated right. There's other things that come that God says, I I'm not even going to take time for a diagnosis here. I'm just going to heal you, &gt;&gt; but that's in his hands. &gt;&gt; A peace that surpasses all understanding. That doesn't mean that that it's something that is that is uh uh that that is beyond uh all uh let me see how am I saying this? It's it's not this peace that passes understanding. It It's not something that I'm saying that well you can't talk about this where I'm saying look friends you try to share this piece you can't really share it through words. &gt;&gt; You can't get somebody there through taking them through a story. You can giving them a testimony you can lead them to the one that can give them the peace. &gt;&gt; It's a piece that doesn't make reasonable human sense. It defies human logic. &gt;&gt; Satan don't want you to have peace. He wants to keep you tore up about everything, anything that he can get to get you tore up in your mind. &gt;&gt; And and and if he can get us self-centered and self-focused, he can keep us tore up in our mind over something that's going on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if we can take and say, "Look, my life is in God's hand. He's in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever he sends me, I'll go. Whatever he tells me to do, I'll do. Whatever I got to go through, I'm willing to endure. Spurgeon, Charles Spurgeon, he says this. He says, "What is God's peace? The unruffled sincerity of the infinite ha in infinitely happy God. Let me read it again. I stumbled on it. What is God's peace? The unruffled serenity of the infinitely happy God. The eternal composure of absolutely wellcontented God. surpasses all understanding. It isn't that it's senseless necessarily, you know. It's that it must be experienced. &gt;&gt; That's what I was trying to say. But you can't just tell them through words to to know what I'm talking about about this peace that surpasses all understanding. You got to experience it. Now, let me tell you something. Here's the key, brother David. There's only one way to to that you're going to experience this peace. You got to first have no peace. &gt;&gt; You got to first have something going on in your life adversity that's got it turned up on its head and upside down and has wrecked your peace. &gt;&gt; Or at least the peace you thought you had. Cuz see, our definition of peace is everything being hunky dory, &gt;&gt; slowly smoothing, nothing going wrong, no adversity. That that's our definition of peace. That is not the definition of this peace. This peace that passes all understanding. You can have peace in the midst of of of the hardest trial in your life. &gt;&gt; You can have peace in the midst of the worst disease to strike you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let me just take a few moments on this. Let me say this first. The things I'm going to describe to you from my testimony. All right. Look, I'm not just trying to point it. Look, I know that people are affected mentally by many different ways. &gt;&gt; So, we're really all familiar with like uh things that that are outside stressors, we'll call them, that affect people's minds and torment them. some of the things I mentioned about, you know, being worried about your your children, your lost loved ones and things. Uh, you know, a financial issue in your life or or or or somebody that's just putting pressure on you from something at the job or or, you know, loss of your home, your job or anything like that. You know, those are outside stressors and they can cause you mental anguish. They can actually cause you anxiety. They they can cause you to feel depressed. They can cause you to to just I mean just begin to plummet. &gt;&gt; But think about this. Think about if you had anxiety and you were depressed and everything around you was wonderful. Think about if you were standing there and you say, you know, everybody's telling you, don't think that way. Well, what's going on? Well, just be happy about that. If you actually have a mental illness, it's actually a disease. It is that you're Let me explain it this way. How many knows anything about sugar diabetes? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Anybody know anything about sugar diabetes? All right, listen. And if you don't, get with Sister Naomi, she'll tell you. Sister Linda, she's over here. Get with any of these nurses. They'll break it down for you. All right. Now, I I'll do my best, sisters. All right. Now, your pancreas has to create insulin for your body because you got to have sugar in your blood. And and there's and you know, people think sugars are thinking they think white granulated sugar and all this stuff. Now your body everything actually you eat. This was discouraging for me when I was first diagnosed. Everything you eat your body converts it into sugar. Not just the Danish brother David. If you eat a steak your body is going to convert that into sugar. Now not the same way and not as much. So, I'm not giving you a license to eat a Danish if you got this. All right? But what happens is your body stops functioning right. Your pancreas either doesn't want it's not producing the insulin you need in order to keep the you see, you got to have sugar. If you don't have sugar in your blood, then what happens? Anybody ever suffered from uh from their sugar bottoming out? Low low blood sugar. You know, you your sugar bottoms out and drops. What happens? you start to feel lightaded, you you'll feel you start to feel nervous and shaky and and you'll get these feel like jitters in your stomach, you know, and and you kind of feel a little bit sick and and if it gets too much low or whatever, you going to lose consciousness. You know why? The brain is being starved of sugar. &gt;&gt; So, you got to have it. But you can't have too much because if you got too much, then it starts to bring break down the blood vessels. It starts to break down the organs in your body. They can't handle it. &gt;&gt; It's in your blood flows throughout your whole body. &gt;&gt; So the insulin that's produced by your pancreas, it it it interacts with that in your blood and it keeps that sugar level at where it's supposed to be to actually for your body to function. What a wonderful God we serve. But if your pancreas isn't producing the right amount of insulin or you have things that make you insulin resistant. Now, I know a lot of people think you're diabetic must mean you're fat. Skinny people can have it, too. &gt;&gt; It ain't about that. Only thing being fat does is make you more insulin resistant. And in fact, a lot of other things, too. But anyway, look, and there's two types of diabetes, right, sisters? Two types. Is it type one and type two? Is that what they call it? Yeah. Two types. Type one, type two. So, type one, see if I get this right. Type one is you're having low blood sugars. You know, is that what it is? You know, people, they're they're I what I mean is it's the way it's processed. That individual has to have things because it reacts different with them. They're not going around ready ready for their their head to blow off over having their sugars too high. It just works different. Let me go on. It doesn't really matter. What I really want to get across the point is it's something not working right in your body. Same thing with somebody that has heart disease. &gt;&gt; Now, these things, there can be things in your family that will make you predisposed to some of these things. You know, it ain't like you can really inherit like heart disease, but you can be you can inherit certain genetics and genes that will predispose you to it. Diabetes that if you got it on both sides of the family, you're in trouble. &gt;&gt; You better stop eating the donuts today. I don't care how young you are. I don't care if they check your blood sugar and say you're good. Start taking care of yourself cuz you're predisposed. Maybe you'll never get it, but you know, but let me go on. So, it's the same thing with this mental illness. Now, let me explain that. So, what happens is your your body and and the things in your brain, and I'm not going to get too technical here, but there's certain chemicals that have to be produced and released into your brain to your brain cells to get your brain to function right. &gt;&gt; All right? Uh I if if you're feeling happy, it's because certain chemicals are are hitting just right within your brain cells to make you feel happy. You know, the serotonin and endorphins and you know, all these other things. I'm not going to get into all the scientific technical names because it wouldn't really help you. But there's just suffice there are chemicals your body has to produce that feeds the cells in your brain and makes your brain work. Right? If that is not working right, just like your pancreas not working right, what happens is a person could have a bliss in their life. They could be nothing wrong and be as depressed as if the world had caved in on them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's nothing tangible to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it's not connected to an outside stressor. &gt;&gt; That's good. It's what I explained to you that ain't working right. Same thing with anxiety. Now, there's different things that people can be experienced anxiety over. All right? And and some people, you know, they get nervous around crowds and some people they, you know, different things that just kind of they have a little trouble and they get anxiety over it and things. But it but if your anxiety comes from what I've described you about a mental disease, there is nothing tangible about it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You you could be standing in a room with people that loved you and you feel like you're about to die. That's right. &gt;&gt; You could be you could be standing there with nothing around you but air and feel a weight perhaps crushing you on your chest and you having a hard time breathing your heart racing and everything else pounding and hurting and there isn't really due to anything physical or or outside. Something ain't working right. The brain tells your body everything what to do. when they put a person when a person is there on the deathbed and if they're if they go brain dead, if their brain stops and they go brain dead, it don't matter how much that machine's making their heartbeat or making their lungs breathe or whatever, that person's gone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; Because it's a brain that makes this thing function. &gt;&gt; It's &gt;&gt; tells it what to do. The brain is the control tower for your body. Thank God it's not the control tower from me. &gt;&gt; But that's what Satan tries to convince you it is. Remember brother Adam said this the greatest battle ever fought. He says Satan chose the mind. Now we we we believe that when we think about how Satan brings evil thoughts to us or brings outside stressors and battles and worries in our mind. But a demon can actually come. It's a demon of a mental illness and strike somebody just like a demon of cancer. &gt;&gt; And and and friends, look, it's also something that you could be predisposed to. You know, when you go when you go to a doctor, they ask you, "Anybody in your family ever had heart disease? &gt;&gt; Anybody in your family a diabetic? Anybody in your family ever had high blood pressure?" That's like the three main ones they ask you on top of all the other ones &gt;&gt; and they want to know and then they'll say who had it &gt;&gt; and then and then they want to know this they want you know many I was used to them always asking me is your daddy your grandpa mama and all that whatever I I went to a doctor here a few years ago and they asked me say how about your brother &gt;&gt; how about your brother they wanted to see not that I could get it from my brother but we were both off the same free. &gt;&gt; Nope. You ain't got any of that. &gt;&gt; So they ask you, well, when you go for mental illness, they asked you, is there anybody in your family on either side ever suffer from mental illness? You tell them yes. Then they're going to ask you this. Has anybody on your on either side of your family then ever committed suicide or attempted suicide? Why? They know that it's it's the genetics that predisposes you to being able to have this disease. &gt;&gt; Now, we know the all diseases are of the devil. &gt;&gt; But think about this. Brother Ram said, "How do you get cancer?" He says, "Sell backslides in the body." &gt;&gt; That just makes it real simple for us believers to understand. So I had some things backsliding up here. Didn't want to work right. So I I suffered depression so bad. And it wasn't because I had grandkids being born. We we weren't struggling financially. We everything it was I mean wonderful beautiful things. But I was suffering from depression. They call it, I believe they call it clinical depression. Clinical depression. Thank you, brother Roco. Listen, friends. Brother Roco has suffered through these very things that I'm telling you about as well. I don't mean to embarrass you, brother, but he's got quite a testimony, too. Clinical depression means it's not an outside stressor or something out here that's make you ain't got nothing to be depressed about. Just plain English. But you can't shake it. It's there because it's you ain't getting the right chemicals up there on them brain cells and so it's taking you through it. Anxiety, you know, I'll tell you what, Satan Satan, if you're suffering for anything you're Satan tries to work through embarrassment and shame. &gt;&gt; I can tell you this from a a person who has suffered from what I've suffered from. He tries to make you ashamed. tries to make you embarrassed about it. He don't want you to share this. He don't want you to talk. He wants you to hide from people. &gt;&gt; He wants you to hide it from people. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When you get out around people, you know, when you feel like you can kind of hold yourself together a little bit, get around to people, you just put on a mask. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you put on a mask, you present that people around, they may not had no clue and you don't want them to be around you when you start having one of these attacks of depression or attacks of anxiety. I was I was 53 years old. I was getting ready to turn 54. Was out in the driveway and I got attack of anxiety. And I I'm going to tell you because I want you to see just how much how the devil will work through this. It don't make sense. But I was getting ready to turn 54 and a thought hit me. Your grandfather, the one you were so close to, he died at the age of 54. You are going to die. And I'm standing out there blubbering out there in the driveway. Mina comes out. What's wrong? What's going on? I said, I'm going to die. My patball died at 54. I'm getting ready to turn 54. I'm going to die. You can't stand there and reason with that individual to get them explained out of that. You ain't going to fix them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Say, "What do I do?" Just put your arm around him and love them. &gt;&gt; Put your arm around him, love them, and just pray &gt;&gt; because God's the only one can come on the scene and do something. &gt;&gt; Hey, you can't reason. You can't reason with them because they they they are afflicted with something that takes them beyond being able to reason because it's not something tangible. &gt;&gt; I was already beginning to suffer from this in the early part of 2011. It was already times what what started the first shines was started happening. You know, everybody be gone from the house. I'd be there alone in the morning. I'd wake up. I I couldn't even get out of bed. I only got out of bed if I had to walk over to the bathroom and then right back into the bed I came. I didn't eat. I didn't clean up. I didn't get dressed. I didn't do nothing. I just laid there and tried to sleep &gt;&gt; because sleep seemed to be the only escape. from the torment of what seemed to be reality. So that was the start of it, you know, and at that point, nobody really knew what was going on. I didn't really know what was going on. I just know I was suffering bad, but I didn't really want to talk about it. Mina would come home, I had a you been up? No. Did you eat? No. Did you uh you didn't get up at all? I didn't take a shower or nothing. I didn't get up. I didn't. Let's get you cleaned up. Get you something to eat. I want to go back to bed. During that time, we had an individual in our church. He was also suffering from mental illness. Now, I'm just going to go a little bit into this because there's a whole another testimony about him and I think some of it you've heard before. Brother Tim her. And so, you know, here he was suffering from from mental illness. Now, I didn't understand. Let me tell you something. You know what the biggest hindrance to individuals that are suffering is? Look, I'm sorry if you don't like this word, but it's ignorance. &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going on and nobody around you know what's going on. And then you got people around you that and sometimes preachers that don't understand what's going on and they're just telling you you ain't got the Holy Ghost. You ain't got faith. While I'm on that, just let me jump down here and read you a quote I throw in. I didn't give it to y'all because it came to me right before I came out of the back. Many times you see a person may be of insanity. Now, they may yet may be yet a converted person filled with the Holy Spirit yet be totally insane. That's right. That has nothing to do with the soul. &gt;&gt; It's a tormentor. something that torments them in their mind. But you have people out there that don't want to know, don't want to understand because they think everything's about an outside stressor &gt;&gt; and they won't take time to go look at this. If you preachers, if any of y'all out there listen to me, just look up Charles Spurgeon and read it. He preached a message on depression and how mental illness affects God's people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got I didn't want to I didn't want to talk to him. I I I I withdrew to myself sometimes my family around. I just go off and go to my room and shut the door and just sitting there by myself. I didn't want him to see me. I didn't I wouldn't go visit other churches. Y'all would see me up here maybe once a year. I know there was one year I never even came during that time. I'd come, you know, my dad or Samuel, they'd be forcing me to preach. I'm going to tell you something, people. I was preaching out of old notes I'd studied years ago, bringing it didn't have this kind of stuff then. I had paper up here. All I was doing is reading off it. You know why? because I I was suffering so bad with this mental illness sometime I couldn't think I couldn't get inspired I couldn't feel because listen listen I I believe all right I'm not against us using doctors and and and and science and medication to help us &gt;&gt; all right but I can tell you this don't ever think because you have to take that that that's the rest of your lot in life. &gt;&gt; God can heal you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was on medication. They started put what happened was I'm sorry. Let me let me go back and get a hold of this. So Tim Tim Horn was going through this and and it got I was trying to help him but he got God got on see him so bad, you know, and on the day on his wedding day he was supposed to get married. I was trying to get over to the church and and I was a little late getting over there before the wedding and and and and I I finally I got over there and he wasn't there at the church and and that and his dad wasn't there and I came in and I think it was his brother-in-law told me said uh uh Jim went to go find him and so uh so brother Jim calls me he says hey look get a key off somebody at his house he's got himself locked in his house come over here you know come out here where I'm at I'll be right there so I got a key drove out there by the time I got out there. Brother Jim had done left his house, drove out to the end of the road and was sitting out there at the end of the road in his vehicle because he heard something, but he didn't want to process that. So, we get back over to the house and we go in, I discover him. He he he he shot himself. He killed himself, committed suicide. Now, you know, there's a whole another testimony behind that, friends. And I could get into this whole thing and attack people's beliefs on thinking people that commit suicide are lost. But you know, that's a whole another thing. Suffice it to say, I don't believe that. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam didn't teach that. Neither does the Bible. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; That that that's actually a doctrine that even the Protestants who have it got it out of the Catholic Church. Let's go on. Anyway, so this is a horrific scene. All right. Now, any of you I Well, I was hoping Brother Cruz would be here this morning. Maybe he'll hear this. Look, Brother Cruz can tell you about soldiers suffering PTSD. You you suffer from things that you experienced, a trauma, a great trauma that happened to you like in war for soldiers. But any of you experience a great trauma that is greater than what your mind can handle and process, it causes post traumatic stress syndrome. They've actually now I think they call it PT S or PTDD or something post dramatic whatever it's disease. They want to put disease on there. But anyway, it's a it's a disorder that you have because of a trauma you has experienced. Now, what happens is that because just think about this, I I ended up with that on top of having this mental illness of depression and anxiety. And so, when that that will strike you and you go back through it, it could be just something that triggers it and and all of a sudden you're back there again. You're going through it. So whatever your body experienced and felt at that time, your blood pressure raised, your heart begin to race, pound or whatever, whatever you were feeling at that time, it's all over again. If they put a blood pressure cuff on you, your blood pressure would be up right then. &gt;&gt; You're experiencing it all over again. But it's all from here. They would tell me, they told me when I went in for for help with this, they said, "Look, our body is a sensory, you know, uh, our body reacts with sensory things." And said, "What your when your mind is going through this with a PTSD, it's it's not, you know, to to try to help you come out of that, you need to have something sensory going on." So, they would tell you like splash water on your face. They they told me he said get something that means something to you, hold it in your hand, you know. So I read what brother Brandham said about you know having a cross and how he look to it you know like he brother Brandham actually talked about having hanging off his mirror said if a Satan walked some un ungodly undressed woman down the street he would just turn and look at the cross. &gt;&gt; So I I'd read that. So I went and bought me a soldier's cross. And I and I had that cross and anytime that I would start to have that, I'd get it out and I'd just start to rub it. If I heard a gun go off, sent me into it. I had to do the graveside at Sister Linda's daddy's funeral, uh, Brother Carper. And I was up there and, you know, he was a soldier and and they done that 21 gun salute. I was off on the side. My aunt that knew what was going on that was over standing by me. I was off on the side. I dug down in here, pulled out that cross and I was just kind of rubbing it like that and trying to get my my my sensory off of that stuff and get my mind back and then I'd plead the blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, here I I had all this going on. Now, this thing with the PDSC, that was an outside stressor, but that's not what brought on my disease. My point in bringing this up is you can have that disease and then outside stressors will can just add to it. Some of the trial that you begin to go through or somebody attacking your family or taking you to court or something like that, it's just going to add to it. You already having trouble. Look, this is the reason I'm telling you. Look, it doesn't matter whe if you're suffering. It doesn't have to be a mental illness like I had a disease. We We all suffer mentally because that's how he battles us in our minds. What I'm trying to tell you is it's not like there's hope for some of it, but no hope for the other part. &gt;&gt; He's the Lord our God that health all of our diseases. I don't care what you might be suffering from, individual suffering from mentally. God is here to heal you. God is here to deliver you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and his deliverance, if it's outside stressors, things going on in your life, it isn't removing them. &gt;&gt; It's giving you the peace that surpasses all understanding to sit there and go through it. &gt;&gt; The peace that lets you endure. &gt;&gt; Satan friends, look, he tries to work through fear. He worked through fear on me. I tell you what, there be time anxiety. What is anxiety? The person has this feeling of impending doom. &gt;&gt; They're going to die. Something bad's going to happen. So, hey, look, man. It's it's all, you know, rainbows and roses around here right now. They don't have anything to do with it. They they just they can't help it. It is not a a like a thought and you can't get out of it through positive thinking. &gt;&gt; Friends, this is the one thing that there was times that that my wife had to rush home as I called her up and said, "That's it. I'm done. I'm ending this. You just want to escape." And and Satan tries to get you singled off and try to get you to where you you'll hide it and nobody knows what's going on in that. Why? Because he that's look brother gives a whole analogy about Satan trying to get the little deer off from the rest of the herd. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam uses that to talk about when Satan gets you so discouraged you don't want to come to church. He's got you all cut off from the rest of the believers. He's got you cut off from the preaching of the word. Hallelujah. 12 years I suffered from it. My wife and I, we began to look into it. I began to I I read what Charles Spurgeon preached about it, &gt;&gt; you know. We we looked up other things. Doctors, you know, helped us. I I'd went the whole reason I got went to the doctors about it is I talked to my wife and my my daughter oldest daughter finally told him you know Nate was getting married on the day he was getting married it was about a year after this other incident happened and man anxiety got on me and I I just you know that a thought my son's going to kill himself that wasn't reasonable &gt;&gt; and and Satan was telling me do this to be to to to to get relief from that. So they said, "Why don't you just go out and get drunk? Why don't Why don't you just go do this or why don't you go do that?" And you you're like, "I don't want to do that." Oh, man. Yeah. Well, if I just want deliver, you know, and Satan says, "Why don't you just shoot yourself? Why don't you just commit suicide? Just end it. You'll get relief." I'll tell you something, friends. A person tormented so bad they they actually losing any type reasoning sense of whatever and that's what happens to them. They lose hope. And that's what Satan wants us to do. And everything that's going on in your life, anything you're suffering from, Satan wants you to lose hope. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm here to tell you this morning, 12 years later, I've made it through on the other side. The devil made me afraid. The devil brought fear on me. He tormented me. But I'm going to tell you this morning, friends, I'm not afraid of him anymore. But I can tell you who is. The devil is afraid of me because I am not going to be shut up. I'm going to talk about the faith of God. I'm going to testify of it. I'm going to tell you how God can deliver you, how God can set you free. I'm going to show you how it can look utterly hopeless and impossible, but you can make it through. &gt;&gt; God, I'm still counting my blessings. [Applause] I can look now and see why God the purpose he had me go through it. I I during the time I was going through it. Friends, I I prayed for somebody here several years back that was suffering from was on medication. She came up for prayer off the medication. and God healed her. Oh, over in the Philippines just counseling with somebody. I I'm not I'm not talking about personal counsel. We was like questions and answers to young people, me and my brother. And and somebody asked a question for a friend. This wasn't due to friends. She wasn't asking for herself. She asked a question for a friend about this feeling depressing and suicide and and thoughts and all these different things. And so Samuel was actually up there and Samuel looked at me and he goes, "Jerry, won't you come up and take this one?" And so I came up there and I just spoke and talked to the young people a bit. I was suffering bad, friends. It was 2019. I didn't get healed until 2023 and I just came up and I just talked to him a little bit. The the camp ended. Sunday morning came. Brother Oel put me with his associate pastor and he took me up to some little village somewhere. Got in this little village in this little church, you know, and maybe maybe about I don't know less than a quarter the size of this building, the sanctuary. I mean, it was real small. People was around me just like about like this big right here. We're sisters sitting right there just around like that. That was it. Full of people. little old tiny place and I preached. I got done preaching. There was somebody who wanted to be baptized. We baptized them. And then then they they that kind of opened it up for testimonies. Here comes this young lady that had been at the camp comes up there and gives a testimony how God healed and delivered her from mental illness. She said because brother Jerry him what he said. And here I I was like, "God, &gt;&gt; I'm suffering for this." And then I found where Brother Brandham was talking about how he had been afflicted and he was suffering. And brother Brandham when he was telling people about it, he he was telling them, "I'm still suffering from it." &gt;&gt; And and and he told him, he said, and his thought was, you know, I've prayed for people that's got diseases far worse than what I'm afflicted with. &gt;&gt; And he says, and they are healed, and here I am still suffering. Brother Ram even told the people tell I'll get back to you on this. He wasn't healed yet, but God did heal him. &gt;&gt; But but I looked at that thought because I was thinking how could I pray for people and God heal them. Look, brother Ram says this. If you want your prayers to be successful, he says, put yourself in their shoes. I was able to do that. &gt;&gt; I was suffering. So when they come up to me suffering, I knew how they felt &gt;&gt; and I was able to cry out to God for them. You said, "Then why weren't you getting healed?" Because I had to endure. &gt;&gt; God wanted me to endure. Why? Because I believe I'm going to reach souls clear around this world. We got young people out in the campsing from mental illness. We got churches suffering from mental ill. We got believers. Some of you friends, they suffer from mental illness. They give up hope and they actually end their lives. &gt;&gt; Somebody, God sends somebody. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends, I'm willing for him to send me. I am happy that I endured. &gt;&gt; I don't look back at it and feel bad about that. I had to go through that. I feel happy that I did. But I tell you what, &gt;&gt; praise God. &gt;&gt; I I the devil that's afflicted of people, he don't want me around because he's afraid of me now. &gt;&gt; I'll stand there with you just like David. Who is this Philistine that defies the armies of the living God? Who's this devil that's defying God's children? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, brother Adam says this. He says this is in the message of uh faith cometh by hearing. He said, "Now it is true that some great person of faith or great warrior of faith has more faith to stand there that burly faith and take the thing away. But unless you stand right there with the same faith, it'll come right back again. I'm going to tell you something, friends. Going through it for 12 years, God taking me through it and endured to me coming out and being able friends to look back at the details. I got some blessings to count. I see God in it as I look back in the details of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, I can stand here today with you. I don't care what you're suffering from. I don't care what's going on in your life. Let's stand. I don't care what's going on in your life. I don't care what the devil has afflicted you with. I don't care whether it's finances. I don't care whether it's your job, your life, your family. I don't care if it's mental illness, physical illness. I'm going to tell you this. The devil will not stand before this faith this morning. &gt;&gt; I preached to you about faith to raise your faith. &gt;&gt; I've got faith to pray for you. I've got faith to stand here and believe on the word of God. I believe he'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. I believe he's the Lord our God that supply all we need. I believe he is the Lord our God. Hallelujah. That health all of our diseases. I believe he's the Lord our God. He that he is our banner. &gt;&gt; Will you believe? I've preached to you to raise your faith to a level. Let's believe together. Nothing will stand before you. &gt;&gt; The devil has got to go. He's got to back down. He has no right. You belong to God. [Music] &gt;&gt; I got one last quote. Let me find it. Brother says this. He swore by himself, not by faith. move right into this blood cell with the Lord Jesus where all those redemptive blessings are yours. You're everyone a Christian. Then if you're Christians, you have a right, a legal right for everything that Christ died for. It's your possession. You own it. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Random talks to the interview with Sister Bruce. We know what that's about. This is This is Sister Bruce. She doesn't think she has the Holy Ghost. The devil is pointing at her hall, her mistakes, right? And so she's pointing at the devil's pointing at the mistakes is an evidence. She don't got it. Brother Brandon points to the evidence down in her soul. That's where your real evidence is. He said, "You were going this way, you were living this way, and then something changed you, and now you're not that way. Look at your desire and think, remember, read the interview." But she says this, "I've made so many mistakes." That was that was the the last thing. I make so many mistakes. Brother Bam said that's what he died for. &gt;&gt; No matter friends, look, I don't care what what it is that that you have need of this morning. That's what he died for. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you this morning. Dear God, I ask Lord for you to come. Lord, I ask Lord God that you would touch these people. Lord, I don't know what's going on in their lives, dear God. And Lord, I just felt by impressed by you, Lord, to give more of my testimony here again. They them to hear a little more about it. And Lord, but more or less, God, to testify, dear God, of being recovered. I'm sure, dear God, if they go back through the the the the the the video files that they got on file around here when I preached years ago, they could go and look and they could see a difference today. &gt;&gt; What is it? You've restored me, God. &gt;&gt; It was my preaching was never my ability. It was always you inspire me and anointing me. But God, you have us go through experiences, dear God, that we can draw from that point us back to the word that we can testify of. But Lord, I'm not I'm not here, God, just with my words to tell them I'm recovered. Lord, God, this message was about showing them that I'm recovered, putting it right in the devil's face, &gt;&gt; a testimony. their God. It It should be just radiating from me right now. I am free. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, Lord, I just want to say thank you for sending me through it. I'm happy, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry. And don't you be afraid. Joy comes in the morning. Troubles they don't last always. For there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away. And if your heart is broken, just lift your hands and say, "I know that I can make it. I know that I can stand no matter what may come my way. My life is in your hands. With Jesus, I can take it. With him, I know I can stand. No matter what may come my way, my life is in your hands. So when your tests and trials they seem to get you down and all your friends and love ones are nowhere to be found. Remember there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away. And if your heart is broken, just lift your hands and say, "I know that I can make it. I know that I can stand no matter what may come my way. My life is in your hand. Oh, with Jesus I can make it.

When I when I was going through that, you know, my wife, she she she she struggled because she wanted to help me. She didn't know what to do. She didn't understand what it was, you know, and she'd say, "What can I And I'd say there's nothing you can do. Just hold my hand, you know, pray for me, you know. And uh uh but brother Bo Smeen, I got two individuals on the name out to you. Brother Boat is one of them. He's over in West Tennessee. Good friend of mine. He's been a friend of me ever since I moved down there 26 and a half years ago. And and and so he would reach out to me by phone. I I actually pulled away from everybody. I I I wouldn't visit nobody. I wouldn't go nowhere. I just kind of pulled away and and stayed away. become brother Dave Moore said I become a hermit and uh but I just I pulled away from everybody calls embarrassment and shame and and guilt and all these different things you know and actually you know feeling like that nobody understood feeling like you know that I was being condemned by others that would say you know well there's something wrong with you spiritually but brother Bo never did that brother Bo wouldn't leave me alone brother Bo would call me sometimes I tried to dodge his call but he just keep calling and I'd have to answer. And brother Bo would get me on the phone and he would talk to me. If I called him up, he'd friends, he'd leave West Tennessee and come over Middle Tennessee, he just come pray for me. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; This is what I'm pass on to. He was there for me as a friend. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He didn't try to fix me, brother Roco. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He just was there to pray with me. He was just there to believe with me. He was just there. He would come preach for me. He prayed for me. God touched me during a time right in the middle of it in 2016. Satan had me convinced I did not have the Holy Ghost that God didn't he was done with me through with me and God came and slayed me out in the spirit under his prayer and and and I wasn't healed. But I'll tell you one thing, I begin to climb up out of that valley I was in that I didn't have the Holy Ghost and God didn't care about me. I want tell you another one. Brother David Crest Jr. over here. He would send me cards. He knew that there was something about going through the mountains of West Virginia would help me. He helped me get there. He anonymously sent some toys for me to go. He would send me cards. He would text me. He say, "Brother Jerry, y'all laid you on my heart to pray. I don't know what's going on, but I just want to let you know I'm praying for you." I And I tell him, I say, "Brother David, I'll give you a testimony about it later." I bless you, brother David. Here, this is what I want to say, friends. Look, somebody's going through something. We're We're here for one another. &gt;&gt; You don't have to understand necessarily what they're going through. You don't have to try to give them a a solution &gt;&gt; uh through some kind of a pep talk or something. &gt;&gt; Just pray with them. Pray for them. &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm standing with you in faith. just reach out. They might be going through a really dark valley at that very moment in that very day and just a text or a phone call or a card from you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Vanam says this, Brother David Chris, back me up on this. He says, "When God lays a burden on your heart for somebody, he said it's that person's angel that's come to you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That person's angel has come to you &gt;&gt; to ask you to pray for him. &gt;&gt; We each one have a particular angel that's been assigned to us. &gt;&gt; And that's what the prophet of God said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You get a burden on your heart and go to prayer. &gt;&gt; But hey, just reach out if no more than saying, "Hey, look, I'm praying for you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How you think you can I don't know if I can sing this song, but I want to sing that chorus at least again that I sung earlier. The Lord will help me cut my mic just a minute. Too slow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at this. Let me say tell you what this says. It says, "It's like it was yesterday that I was praying for a miracle, scared to have a little hope." &gt;&gt; And now looking back, seeing all the things that you've done, &gt;&gt; I can't even add them up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One, two, three, up to infinity. I'd run out of numbers before I can thank you for everything. I know you. Let's try another key. Something a little bit lower where I can get higher. I think that was in G. Let's go a little bit lower than that. Hallelujah. God, I'm still counting my blessings. all that you done in my life. The more that I look in the details, the more of your goodness I'll find. Father, on this side of heaven, I know I'll run out of time, but I will keep counting my blessings, knowing I can't count that high. God, I'm still counting my blessings. Sing it with me if you can. All that you done in my life. The more that I look in the details, the more that I look in the details, the more of your goodness I'll find. Father on this side of heaven. I know I'll run out of time, but I will keep counting my blessings, knowing I can't count that high. And I know that seasons never last forever. So God, I will remember all of the reasons my heart has to be grateful. All of the times you've been faithful to me. And God, I'll keep counting my blessings. All that you done in my life. The more that I look in the details, the more of your goodness I'll find. Oh, Father, on this side of heaven, I know I'll run out of time, but I will keep counting my blessings, knowing I can't count that. You know what? He's blessed me in so many ways, friends, and he ain't stopped. He ain't never stopped. &gt;&gt; He has blessed me in so many ways in my life that if I started counting them today, I wouldn't have enough time between here and the resurrection and rapture to tell you all about all of them. &gt;&gt; That's what that means. I'm going to run out of time here in this life. I got He's just blessed me in so many ways. I don't got enough time to to actually number them all because it it's it's eternal. It just keeps going. It's infinite. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He just keeps blessing us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't don't wallow. Don't wallow in in what's going on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Count your blessings. You might be going through the worst thing in your life right now, but that's only because it's an opportunity for God to bless you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your sickness is an opportunity for healing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're bound, it's an opportunity for deliverance. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you're lost, it's an opportunity to be saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is it? Hallelujah. He has attributes that he wants to display to us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wants to bless us. &gt;&gt; Friends, he wants to bless you more than you want to be blessed. If you could believe that, &gt;&gt; God wants good things for you, his children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He just don't want us to become complacent and comfortable in this life. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe what's going on right now. &gt;&gt; Read the message. Brother Adam talks about as the eagle stirth her nest. I believe that's what's going on right now. &gt;&gt; That eagle begins to take all the fluff out of the nest. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's time for that eagle is to leave that nest. &gt;&gt; We're in the nest of this world. I believe the fluff is being it's being took out. &gt;&gt; God's letting it take out the fluff. &gt;&gt; Say, "I ain't comfortable here no more. You ain't supposed to be. &gt;&gt; God wants us to get ready to get out of here, my friends. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm looking forward, brother David, to the time of the millennium when Satan will be bound for a thousand years. And that chain that he's bound by is a chain of circumstance. Meaning that I am in I I it's not just my soul that's in the redeemed state, but my I'll be in a theophony, &gt;&gt; right? I'll be in a theophony, which right now I'm in a human spirit. It's got all these gates that the devil torments me in. My memory, my conscious, my reasoning, my imagination, my affections. &gt;&gt; The devil torments me in them. Oh, but we know one day we're going to that marriage supper of the lamb and and and we're going to be sitting there and brother random said, "You're going to look around and you're going to notice so and so didn't make it. They ain't here at that table. This one didn't make it. My son didn't make it. My daughter didn't make it. This one didn't make it. this level, this brother, this is somebody, you know, they didn't make it and you're going to be sad. He says, "Then God is going to come around and he's just going to wipe that from your memory." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll see them again, but it won't be with the same memory. If they don't make it, you'll see them there at the day of judgment. But they won't be standing there as the person you had remembered them back about like before God gives you that deliverance. I try to tell I try to tell, you know, I try I've told my kids that and everybody else. Hey, look. If you don't if you don't come to God and accept God's way, if you end up standing out there on the day of judgment, I will not be looking down at you as my son or my daughter or whoever you are. I won't be looking at you that way no more. No, it's you're being judged on your works because that's what you chose. You get on that. Anyway, look, I'm looking forward to that time. But here's the thing. Right now, I'm living in in a in I got the my my spirit can be tormented. Satan can get in those gates, you know, in my spirit and just and just wreck havoc and make me worry, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He can he can afflict my body. &gt;&gt; But I ain't waiting till the time of millennium to shout in the face of the devil. &gt;&gt; I'm going to do it right now. &gt;&gt; I ain't waiting till the time millennium to take possession. This is my possession. I'm taking possession now. I'm going to let the God that that that that has changed my soul on the inside. I'm going to let that be the control tower &gt;&gt; and bring this outside spirit and flesh into subjection to the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to testify &gt;&gt; right now with only one part of my being living in a redeemed state. I'm going to testify of redemption. I'm going to testify of complete redemption. I'm going to testify of deliverance. I'm going to testify that I am more than a conqueror &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to rule now. &gt;&gt; Amen. over this old boy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to give in to it. That's what Satan wants us to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's shout the victory now. Let's sing some kind of song of victory, brother Brian. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One night while on life's raging sea looked as if I would suffer defeat as the blackness of night closed off the light. My heart sank with fear. My desperate cry rang out with fright. All I could see was no hope inside. Faith all but gone. I met the one who was looking for me. He came looking for me. He came looking for me.

So, it may be for someone here may be suffering depressing, but my wife can uh If this is true, for six years I went through depression. I thought any minute my mind was going to snap. She had to pray with me and sing with me and for six long years this went on. So I was going to work one day and I stopped at this light and it was 250 in Bulgar Road and I didn't know years later I'd be living on Bogurt Road. But while I was waiting on the light to change, he spoke to me in here. I won't lie to you if I I know I'd be standing before him. I tell you the same thing. He spoke to my heart and he said in I can't explain it. It's inside a tender voice in my heart. And he said, "This won't bother you anymore." And it lifted. And that's been many, many years ago, and it's never bothered me since. And it won't because it's him &gt;&gt; and what he did for any of us, he can do for you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen.

We're so thankful, Lord, for his testimony. What you did in his life, how you how you set him free, Lord, after all those years, Lord. And I pray that, Lord Jesus, we'd be able to take that as a testimony. Help us, Lord, if we see one another, a brother, sister, they look down something like the brother said, let's not try to fix them, Lord. Let's just let them know how much we love them. Lord, call them up, Lord Jesus. Send them a text, Lord. Head over to their house, fellowship with them, pray with them, Lord Jesus. I pray that we'd be able to stand there. You want us to be a body you can use, Lord God. You need someone to work through, Lord, to minister to your children, Lord. Use us for your glory, Lord. Help us to minister to one another, Lord. We may not be called to preach preach the gospel, Lord, with it with with our mouths in the pullpit, Lord, but we can we can speak the word of God to one another, Lord Jesus, as you give us utterance, Lord.
