TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. God bless everybody this morning, man. Everyone glad to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. God bless you. Brother Roco's got a testimony. He's going to open up service. Uh brother Roco's going to uh give his testimony and then we'll just we'll go right into service after that. Um but we're thankful to hear what God's doing. Amen. I always love hearing testimonies. So looking forward to hear what what God's doing for our brother. Amen. Uh, good morning everybody. Um, this October 15th will mark the second anniversary of my son Benjamin's near fatal car accident. His recovery has been long, painful, traumatizing, and mentally draining, not only for Ben, but also for my wife Jane and me as well. However, I'm happy to report that Ben is completely independent with regard to all of his personal affairs. He has been walking up and down the stairs for about two months. And since early spring, he has been walking around Walmart, Costco, or wherever else my wife does the shopping. He will however need to walk with a cane or some type of assistance as he is crippled because the nerve damage in his left leg and foot were so severe that the damage is permanent. Ben is back behind the wheel of a car. He has been doing all of the driving for my wife when she goes shopping. He is currently shopping for a new car for himself. Despite suffering such incredible trauma, Ben has been able to further his studies in computer science by obtaining specialized licenses which will make him eminently marketable as a software engineer. He's been faithfully going to counseling which has greatly benefited him to process the trauma he's been through and to set goals and manage his life going forward. In closing, during these past two years, many of you have been faithfully reaching out to me to ask how Ben is doing and to remind me that you are praying for him. I want to humbly express my sincere gratitude to you, my dearest brothers and sisters who have been so kind and so loving as to bring my son into the presence of our marvelous God Jehovah Rifa, the Lord Jesus Christ. My prayer is that this testimony will continue to encourage all of us to pray for one another without ceasing because we know that God answers prayer and changes things. &gt;&gt; And may we also be encouraged by the love and faithfulness of our great God, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Thank you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. How many's glad to hear what God's doing? Amen. Amen. [Music] Praise God. [Music] Heat. Heat.

He knows what our needs are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that. I'm thankful that he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. And um I just want to say I so appreciate um the song service this morning, the testimony that was given. Amen. Um brother Matthew, that's special. I really enjoyed that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's very much in the heart of what I'm going to speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's just go to him in a word of prayer. Amen. Maybe if you've got an unspoken request on your heart, you just want to make it known to the Lord. And Amen. God certainly sees beyond our hands. He sees the heart and he's mindful. Oh, heavenly father, Lord, as we come into this moment of the service, how we're so thankful, God, just such a wonderful atmosphere, Lord. Wonderful presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. How how thankful, Lord, we can truly utter like it was when David could say, "I was glad &gt;&gt; when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord." And father, how wonderful it is that we're not just called at a certain time of the year as David would express on that pilgrimage, but oh God to think it's even beyond the moments that we're able together on on Lord in the services or midweek and Sunday. But oh God, just to come into your presence, Lord. Oh God, like the little little Shinomite woman when her there were need arose and her husband said, "Well, it's not a new moon. It's not a feast. Why are you going to the prophet?" But she had a need. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're so thankful, God, that would speak of us in this hour that the provision that is made that we have access through and by the blood of Jesus Christ into the holiest of holies. Lord, that's where we live as and called to live as priests of God. What a privilege it is, Lord. No matter if we're driving down the road, no matter if we're at the job, no matter, Lord, we're walking down the supermarket, no matter where it is. Oh God, we have access to God by one spirit. What a privilege, Lord. &gt;&gt; What a privilege. And it don't have to be a special time, a special day. It doesn't have to be a special moment. You're the love of our lives, Lord. We don't have to wait to a special time. Oh, as David would write, praise waiteth for thee in Zion, oh God. Our hearts, Lord, are filled with thanksgiving. But Lord God, how we are so grateful for these moments that you've given us that we can come and assemble together, not out of a formality, not out of tradition, &gt;&gt; but God, with the desire that knowing that we are we are coming, Lord, into your presence, Lord. We're coming to hear from you, not a man. Lord, we don't we don't need to hear from a man. We need to hear from you. We don't need a man's thoughts or a man's spirit. We need your spirit, Lord. We need your word, oh God. And we're asking, Lord, that you would come, Lord, in a special way, Lord, for every need that is gathered here, Lord, that is behind every uplifted hand, Lord. May you minister, Lord God. I pray your word to our hearts, Lord. And may we leave out of here different, &gt;&gt; different people than when we walked in here, Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord, we pray. Thank you, Lord, for all the specials. Thank you for the testimony, Lord, that brother Roco gave, Lord, regarding his son, Ben. How we thank you for your mercies, Lord, God, to know that you are so mindful &gt;&gt; of every single need. &gt;&gt; Every need, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Even the hairs of our head are numbered, Lord. You're concerned. You know that even if that of a farthing of a of a that of a of a bird would fall to the ground and your prophet would take that and said he would take a a bird that would be thought to be so insignificant but it's to show that God everything matters to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh how we love you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord God. What a confidence. What a love reaches down into our heart, Lord, that God just draws back to you and said, "Lord, we love you. We appreciate you. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for bringing Brother Brian, Lord, through that surgery there, Lord, just a couple weeks ago." Lord, thank you for bringing him right here with us, Lord. Brother Dave Crest, Lord, thank you, Father, for bringing our brother right here with us, Lord. As brother Brian said, these are prayers that have been answered, oh God. And Lord Jesus, we're asking for your mercy, Lord, going with Sister Maria, Lord, this coming Thursday. Oh God, may you move, Lord, for our sister, guide and direct, Lord, the hands of the Lord, the surgeon, Lord. May you put your hands upon that surgeon's hands, oh God. And may you move down, Lord, I pray, oh God, in that surgery, Lord, and perform, Lord, another miracle, Lord. We pray, Father. Grant it, Lord. We ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Could we just turn right into the scriptures this morning? I don't want to take any other time, but I want to go to Leviticus chapter 8. And um if you have a chance to read this chapter um because this is where I'll be spending. We took the last service on it and then I'm going to be spending Lord willing probably a couple more services in here. But I want to draw from this um scripture here in Leviticus 8:es 1 through verse 5. And you may want to just keep your Bibles there. So I because I may refer to a few places there in that chapter but this is the installing not only of the um high priest but it's also the priest. So Aaron and his son so it was a whole a process that they would would God would bring them through. Now they were already seen in the vision. Remember when Moses was caught up they were already mentioned and declared in the vision. And I want to say this to you and I, we have already been declared in the vision of the word. &gt;&gt; But in order to get into that place to be manifested, God had to make a way. And there's a process that he's taken us through. Is that right? Amen. So when we speak about being a seed of God, we speak about being a predestinated seed of God. We understand and I know this is very um maybe elementary or very simple but it's not uh a bypassing or an excusing but it's actually the whole process through justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost is is is delivered with the seed in mind in order to bring us back to God. Are you with me? So it's in order that passing through that process of the spirit of God working in our life to bring us into that place of fellowship with God under the blood. So Leviticus 8 and verse one and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take Aaron and his sons with him and the garments and the anointing oil and a bulock for the sin offering and two rams. Now, one of the rams would be for burnt offering, and the next for consecration, and a basket of unleavened bread. And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. I I don't know about you, but I'm thankful that the door has been revealed to us. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember down in Sodom, there were two messengers that went down to Sodom. And when those two messengers went down to Sodom, remember after they pulled Lot back in the door, the Bible says they on the outside, they staggered, were blinded to even get to the door. And brother Brandham's typing that door with that entrance into the kingdom of God, into the Holy Ghost, because they they're blind. And that's why I remember brother Bram says Billy Graham says I come back into town and how many people came to the altar and then I you you lazy preachers. And brother Bram said it wasn't lazy preachers. &gt;&gt; He said what it is? He said Paul took them all the way. &gt;&gt; So there's got to be a gospel to take us all the way. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Jesus said whoever comes in through through the door comes in by me. I'm the door. I'm the way. I'm the truth. I'm the life. He shall go in and out and find pasture. So I'm I'm very thankful that God has revealed the door. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Look at the end at the end of the Ladyan age here. Here we stand in this hour and God tells us in the age before that in the Philadelphia I have set before thee an open door. That open door is to come back into full relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Not just salvation, &gt;&gt; but to come into full relationship where Christ himself brings about a real transformation in a life. And then here we find in Revelations 4, John was summoned and a voice from heaven said, he said, I looked and there was a door opened in heaven that says, come up hither, John. So all was provided for rapture. There's an open door. There was a place that you and I have been brought into. And I it might just be just a statement within here that I would make, but this is where we come into. We're dwelling in the bright age right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the bride age is not a another church age. &gt;&gt; But it is that where God himself has come in bride form. &gt;&gt; It's an entrance into his presence. &gt;&gt; So how thankful we are for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Moses did as the Lord commanded him. And the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Moses said unto the congregation, "This is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done." May God bless you and bless the reading of the word. As you're being seated, I want to continue to take this thought on being fully consecrated to the word by the spirit. And I want to deal with a a um a part within this here that the the anointing the true baptism of the Holy Ghost follows the blood and you know when we recognize and we can see there's a divine order within scripture. So the Holy Spirit uh brother Brandham would say it like this in the message humble thyself. He said, "He will not put his spirit in an unclean, unholy temple." So, it's got to be a vessel that's been cleansed and cleansed through the blood. And then we know that the anointing is the is that of the spirit. It's the life within the blood. And and I say it in that way because many times this is where that when we look at it that we talk about, well, you need to receive the Holy Ghost. You need to receive the Holy Ghost. And that is true. But the Holy Spirit will not come without there being cleansing. &gt;&gt; A person can come under an anointing and they can feel they can even have you know where uh feel his presence and many times this is where that a person can rely upon sensations, rely upon feelings, rely upon many things and yet not really being able to rely on the word. Right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So let's just take a little journey in the scripture here because I want to say it in this way. Satan is always busy about trying to bring confusion because then if he is able to bring confusion then the whole thing is to try to take it away and that objective from the hearts of the people in their lives and I'm talking about even of lives from whether it's our young people to middle to whomever might come that to recognize there is a provided way. How many times you can go through on your app on your phone and pull up in the message of the hour just type in the word way. You'll find countless num God's provided way for this day. God's provided way for healing. God's accepted way. You'll find it over and over. Why? Because the message of the hour is revealing or uncovering that way. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. When when I was there standing and this just comes to me now. When I was standing there last year in Arizona when brother Andy Schuler took us up there to Eagle Rock and we we we had we were going we came up and around and then we're up there where you you about the time where you can see where the the rocks that are of the four living creatures there. You make this turn and you have to come down this way because this path is no longer used. And you realize when you get down in there in these paths, I started looking and I realized that what even that rock where it says eagle or it did say eagle on it. At one time it was one whole rock that had actually come down from a earthquake in New Mexico and but then through you remember the public works projects and things like that like the stadium in Sunduski is a public works project and I think George is it George Daniel Field? I think it's a public, in other words, you have individuals that during that time, you know, of you get into the depression area and things like that, they had public works, they had work camps. My my grandfather was a part of that in different in different ways, you know, so they could have work. What I'm getting to is is that when I looked down and I was seeing and I was looking with brother Andy, I said, "Brother Andy, here I'm seeing where they put dynamite." You can actually see where it was the dynamite stick was and they blew out that area in order to create that pathway and that trail. I just got beside myself. I said to think that that was written inside that rock on white eagle the whole time. But my point to you and I in this hour is that God God there even just showing within that here was a path that became open that was otherwise not a path and that's what listen that's what man and it's not man but it is spirits and Satan's desire is to block man from the true purpose and relationship that God desires where God would dwell supremely in man's life. &gt;&gt; And so we understand that that that in this this being in the message that God has sent to us that the message is the revealing of that original path back into sunship where they had that relationship on the day of Pentecost. And then as they came into the first church age, there was already a fallen woman and the seed went in the ground. But God said, "I will restore. I'll bring it back to how it originally was." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, as a Bible reader, when you read in Revelations 1, we've read this scripture very a lot. Revelations 1 verse 5 and verse 6. And it says, "Now unto Jesus, who loved us and washed us with his own blood, and he hath made us kings and priests unto his God, right? Unto our God." Then you find that same scripture repeated back in Revelations 5. And you might look and say, "Well, haven't they been down through the ages?" Well, God has worked in portion down through the ages. But coming at the end time, the word would come back in full restoration for what purpose? For sons and daughters of God to come back to full manifestation. That's why this age is like no other age. This age was the promise that God would send his word through his prophet. And a prophet is a mouthpiece of God. It's a seer that's able to see what to see that pathway back to the holiest of holies with a full relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Luther brought us into the courts. Wesley Wesley and Pentecost took us there into the into the holy place. But it was through the message of the hour that brought us into the holiest of holies &gt;&gt; because the baptism of the Holy Spirit made way for the person of Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So now within that God's desire for us to be consecrated to the word by the spirit because you might look and say, well, you know, how do I become united with this? But it's not uh it's not when we think of it as far as a letter, but the word is a person. And the word is Christ. It's God. So how do we become united? Because then to where that this the Bible that we carry and so cherish and so love to where now the God of the Bible is living on the inside and now our lives are simply being expressed and interpreted by the word. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You don't you don't plant you don't get a seed packet and you know you see the picture on the front and on the back you got a lot of writing. Is that right? Right? &gt;&gt; You got whether you're planting maragolds, potatoes, tomatoes or whatever. The seeds are in the packet, but the writing on the outside lets you know the stages of justificate, you know, say it lets you know all the stages that that seed will go through. And the picture on the front is what it will look like when it's coming to maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So remember, God already took a picture of us before the foundation of the world. Let me just say it to you like this. As Job made provision before his his family did one thing, before there was even the thought that crossed his mind about per adventure they might sin, he he offered the burnt offering. He made preparation. I'm going to ask you, what was that a type of? That was a type of the lamb that was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. God already made provision before there ever was a devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before there ever was a sin, God, let me just tell you, he's not just two steps ahead. He's ahead &gt;&gt; of the enemy. &gt;&gt; That's why he said when the enemy comes in like a flood, I, the spirit of the Lord, will raise the standard. &gt;&gt; How does he raise it? He makes his word more real. What could be any more real than the word not only coming to you, that's first, but then drawing you to where you come into the word and the word is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then you know what? You become a standard. &gt;&gt; So the anointing follows the blood. David would say, "Blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causeth." We we couldn't do it unless he not only he would cause us to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house and even of thy holy temple. Jesus said, "No man can come to me except the father which hath sent me. Draw him &gt;&gt; and I will raise him up at the last day." &gt;&gt; So good. Paul would write, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption, the placement, taking our position as the children by Jesus Christ to himself. So it was God come down in the form of man Jesus Christ to span the breach for you and I &gt;&gt; according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; That word accepted is key because it's not and let me just let me just say it and preface it like this. It's it's accepting what God has done &gt;&gt; to believe it and then accept it. That all deals with submission of the heart. To lay down all all your fears, lay down all the thoughts, lay down all the wrestlings. like I lay it all down at the feet of him that not only uh gave himself for me, but he rose up on that Easter morning. And not only that, he sent back the Holy Ghost. And not only that, the Holy Spirit is here to confirm that that you are the reason he came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You've you don't have to you don't have to pay the debt. He already paid it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. &gt;&gt; There's not one elect seed of God that can escape the counsel of God. &gt;&gt; That is so good. You can &gt;&gt; let me just say it to you like this. Every seed of God is coming. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There might come a lot of hard knocks and a lot of hard things, but let me just tell you something. The prophet stood on the other side and here came up this woman and said, "Our precious brother, she was over 90 years old." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "They're wrote in my hand and no man can pluck them out of my hand. I want to remind you in that same hand is the one that holds the seven stars. In that same hand is power and authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; That we should be verse 12 to the praise of his glory. who first trusted in Christ and whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation. So it first comes with hearing the word of truth &gt;&gt; or drawn to that of the truth &gt;&gt; in whom also after that ye believed. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. So, it wasn't when we believed, it's after we believed because the Holy Spirit is God recognizing our faith. And let me just say it like this. What God is actually seeing, he's seeing himself on display. &gt;&gt; He's seeing that faith in your life that is from him that stands back. And as the prophet said, he spoke his word in the beginning and believed his own word. You say, "Who's responsible for that?" God is. But as we will yield to God, giving ourselves to God, this word has transforming power. This word has within it the authority and the ability and the willingness to cast away every evil spirit, every doubt, every It has the ability within it to cleanse us and make us fit subjects for the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. So the priest, as we were looking at this in Leviticus 8, Aaron and his sons could not consecrate themselves. &gt;&gt; That's good, right? But they had to be willing to come God's provided way. &gt;&gt; That's true. They were already spoken of in the vision. &gt;&gt; But you see, it's one thing to be able to see ourselves in the vision and then to realize that the vision must become reality. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? It it's let me just let me say it's a beautiful thing, a necessary thing, important thing to be able to see in the word that he died for you. That is important. And to be able to recognize you are a son of God. Now that you recognize you're a son and daughter of God, now you can pursue the birthright that belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Because you can't stumble. We're not stumbling into the birthright. We don't stumble into the Holy Ghost. It's the Holy Spirit himself that is making himself known. And we understand this. The Holy Spirit is not the second or the third person, the Godhead. The Holy Spirit is the same almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the same God that dwelt in the body of the Lord Jesus. Our sacrifice is the same Holy Spirit that now is coming forth and calling you and I in redemption. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God made that way and how that that they could come back into that place of a full relationship with God. Now, I want to just I want to just really tie in on this point here in this in a scripture in Leviticus 8 and here out of Leviticus 8. And then I'll be I'm going to I'll be referring and kind of working my way a little backwards through Leviticus 8 here just in this service here this morning. But notice where that here they were to come before the door and they as we covered there a couple weeks ago they everything that was needed for them to step and be put into service. Let me say this. The coming of the Holy Ghost is come to put vessels into service. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Service for what? &gt;&gt; For his will. &gt;&gt; As the Bible opens in Acts 1:1, oh great falafilus, all that Jesus began to do and teach and the prophet picks it up in the token in Jeffersonville and he says, "And continues to do." &gt;&gt; That's good. Because he said, I love how he said that his death didn't stop him. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; Because the death, the sacrifice only releases what's in the blood cell. And now what he did in the body of Jesus Christ, he is doing the body of believers. The works that I do, shall you do also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was the works? Oh, you say raising the dead. Well, yeah, raising the dead. But I want you to understand, the dead were raised in the days of Elisha. Right? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? &gt;&gt; Well, walking on water. Well, you know, an axe head was brought to brought to the top under the ministry of Elisha as well. What is it? The works that I do shall you do also would be that of a life that is being lived according to the word of God from a heart that where the word on the inside there has been a uniting and we are harnessed to the word. I I'm not talking about just carrying the Bible and and and and serving God according to our own thoughts. No, it it's got to go deeper than that. That's why that's why the blood was shed. That's why it came down to a place that we might be washed &gt;&gt; from our own way of thinking. &gt;&gt; When Aaron and them came there, they had to be stripped. &gt;&gt; They couldn't go in on their same garments. You see, there's no measure and amount of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; That we can ever muster up that is accepted. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You can read the Bible 365 days out of the year. You cannot measure up to the righteousness of God. You must it must must accept it. &gt;&gt; And when you accept it, you submit to it. &gt;&gt; They didn't get down there in the water and say, "It's all right, Moses. I'll wash myself." No, they had to let Moses wash them. &gt;&gt; God don't need helpers. &gt;&gt; Because you you can't help along the b the birth. Remember, brother Bram says, if you try to help that chicken while it's coming out of the egg, you'll kill it, &gt;&gt; right? You can't you can't pull it out. It's got to come out through that process. And you know what? Sometimes coming out of that egg, God has a provided way. on the end of that beak. It's got a little little a little hard knot. It's there to keep parking. And as it's banging like that, the neck muscles are are building up. That's the same way it is with a child of God coming to a real birth with Jesus Christ. Oh, it's not something that's handed to us on a silver platter, but it's something the spirit begins to quicken, begins to energize, begins to stir our hearts with. Yes, the word is right. Amen to the word of God. Amen to the word of God. What's happening? faith muscles are building to do what? Bring that predestinated seed to life and break that shell. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; So the anointing, it follows the blood. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, it follows the blood. In Leviticus 8, this is jumping a little bit ahead. Like I said, I'm going to work backwards and come up to this in Leviticus 8 and 30. And Moses took of the anointing oil. This is after all the sacrifices. This is after the wave offering. He takes the anointing oil. He takes of the anointing oil and of the blood. Now, when you read in the first part of the chapter, Aaron was anointed before there was ever a sacrifice &gt;&gt; because Aaron was the high priest being a type of Christ. He was anointed with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. He was the anointed high priest because he didn't need to offer sacrifice for himself. Aaron needed a sacrifice for himself. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; It was a type. But now it's coming to this of Aaron's sons, which would be that of you and I coming into that election of God. Everybody with me? Right? &gt;&gt; Because when you think think of how God said to Israel, "You shall be unto me a kingdom of priests in Exodus 19." But then Israel, they rejected grace for law &gt;&gt; and all of that about them being a kingdom of priest. It goes, "If thou shalt, if thy will, if thy will." So they rejected the grace that had brought them so far. And then notice God brings out later that out of in that I'm going to take that of the tribe of Levi unto me to minister a and to minister on behalf of the rest. I'm going to take that tribe and then even out of the tribe of Levi, God takes Aaron and his sons. You see, when God does something, man can try to argue against it. &gt;&gt; But when God vindicates it, God is behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand? A man don't have to wrestle for his position. If it's a God-given position, he can rest. &gt;&gt; Just like in your position as a husband, a wife, and on and on. It's a God-given position. You don't have to wrestle. You don't have to worry. Look at if God gave you that job and you believe God gave you that job, then just just rebuke the enemy and say, "Get out of here, Satan." That's trying to torment my mind. Oh, they're saying layoffs are coming. They're saying this, "Lord, you are my provider." &gt;&gt; I've never seen the righteous forsaken or a child of God have to beg for bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, even when the question came up about Aaron, well, what about Aaron? Why? Why, you know, why Aaron? Why does Aaron have to be the one to go in there? &gt;&gt; God vindicated it with life, &gt;&gt; right? Everybody had to bring in a rod and they had to write their name on the rod. But Aaron's rod &gt;&gt; was vindicated in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; See, God will always vindicate his word in his presence. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? We can have a lot of I seen a sign here, a sign here. I want to bring them signs under the word. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? &gt;&gt; I want to bring them under the word. That that's what I see with the prophet's life because we can have a sign here and a sign here and a sign here. You say, "Brother Samuel, don't we follow signs?" No. Signs are to follow us. &gt;&gt; Come on. The Bible said, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after signs." God has provided the greatest sign that could ever be provided. I'm not just talking about a prophet, but I'm talking about the word not only coming down and becoming flesh, but now that word is inside of you, and your life has been changed. You are a super sign in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ himself born in your life. What a sign. I'll tell you what kind of sign it is. It's an end time seed sign. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; That is so true. &gt;&gt; Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood. So here the spirit and the blood coming together because after all we the blood itself, the literal blood, it's already went on the ground from Calvary. there there wouldn't have been enough literal blood to sprinkle on every one of us. But what it was is that blood had to be shed because the life within it would come back upon the worshipper and it would be the life, the Holy Spirit, God's own life that would draw you and I into relationship. So actually when the spirit of God is speaking to our life, that's the presence of the blood of Jesus Christ in the meeting. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because this blood speaks. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. which was on the altar now sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his garments upon his sons upon his son's garments with them and sanctified Aaron and his garments and his sons and his sons garments with them. Now I want to remind you Jesus said remember them with the um uh there with with you know when Jesus was there with the disciples and Jesus remember they you know Peter didn't want him to go. I mean who would &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They didn't want him to go. Let me just say it like this. That's why you think brother Perry Green reading and I'm not riding on the plane. They were waiting on brother Brandham to rise. It wasn't the brother Brandham. It was Jesus Christ who said they didn't see. They didn't see what was to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word had to be delivered and it was delivered. &gt;&gt; The trail of the serpent was exposed. All that would be needed. The pathway had been opened up. Not by dynamite, but seven angels blasted open. A pathway back into the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; Not a new writing. Not a new writing, but seal it up, John. seal it up. &gt;&gt; And in the end time, not dynamite, but in the end time, the mighty angel Christ himself coming down to do what? Open up the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that mighty angel is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? We are being escorted. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just by angels, but Christ himself in the midst of a bride body. &gt;&gt; And we're not anointed to go down. &gt;&gt; We're anointed to go up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why if you get contrary or I get contrary in our minds or our thoughts, that anointing is greater than your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Yes. &gt;&gt; Now remember when Jesus was here, he told them throughout. He says he began to teach them. The Bible says in Mark 8:31 of how the son of man must suffer many things. They still didn't grasp it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's all right. It wasn't the time. John 14:28, you've heard and how I said unto you, I go away and come again. And if you love me, you would rejoice. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? They thought love you. I would rejoice. I don't want you to go away. &gt;&gt; Right? John 16:37. Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go away. Who's the eye? The sacrifice. The body that that that God was dwelling in. &gt;&gt; It's expedient for who? For you. &gt;&gt; Who's this all about? &gt;&gt; Who's this all about? It's about God coming down and making a way for you and I. &gt;&gt; And if I go not away, the comforter will not come &gt;&gt; unto you. But if I depart, I will send him unto you. When Jesus was walking down the road to Emmas, pardon me. He was walking down the road to Emmas. He came to them. Remember, they were sad. They didn't understand what had taken place. But this is where he came to them and be to open the scriptures unto them and begin to expound all of that which was spoken beginning with Moses all the way down to present hour. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things. Now what's he doing? He's opening letting them know the way has been opened for you to come now into perfect fellowship. The fellowship we've had has not been real oneness. But the oneness that my prayer was for in John 17 was that as the Father was in me and I in him, that I would be in you and you in me in perfect oneness. And in order for that oneness to come to pass, I had to go and make a way for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is so good. So I want to say that here he is the sin offering &gt;&gt; and this sin offering when you look back in the beginnings of that chapter &gt;&gt; and I want you to notice about every one of these offerings the sin offering the burnt offering the ram of consecration the wave offering every one of them was a hands-on event &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; oh that's good &gt;&gt; you got to be identified all the way &gt;&gt; they had to put their hands on the head of that sacrifice &gt;&gt; you got Got to be identified with the word. Got to be identified with Jesus Christ. That's a choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Free moral agency. The only way is through that gate of self-will. &gt;&gt; And this bulock had to be offered for sin. I want to remind you the inward parts of this bulock were offered on the altar, but the skin, the dung, all of it was taken without the camp. &gt;&gt; Jesus suffered without the gate. He was our complete sin offering. He who knew no sin became &gt;&gt; our sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we might be made the very righteousness of God in Christ. As a matter of fact, the prophet tells us in forsaking all there on Calvary, he said, notice when he said, "My God, my God, why is there forsaking me?" He doesn't say my father, my father. Because the spirit had already left in the garden and was leading him to the slaughter. &gt;&gt; And he said he couldn't remain a son &gt;&gt; and pave the way for you and I &gt;&gt; sinners to become sons. So he became sin. &gt;&gt; And he said he became sin that he might make sinners sons. &gt;&gt; He bore it all. He bore everything. He He bore it all. &gt;&gt; Now when we consider this, I want you to think that how this sacrifice when Jesus comes to the River Jordan here after 30 years of living upon this earth, going through different stages of life, knowing what it'd be like for you and I. But the sacrifice has got to be washed before it can be received. &gt;&gt; So you can't just offer up the sacrifice without washing it. Jesus when he came to the river Jordan there to be baptized of John, we all know by the scripture where John's commission was is baptizing unto repentance. He could not baptize for remission of sins because the sacrifice had not been offered up. And Jesus did not enter the water because he had to repent like you and I. When you and I come to the waters of baptism, it is because we recognize ourselves as sinners and we are even in the beginnings to identify ourself with our sacrifice &gt;&gt; to take upon his name. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't have to be washed because he had a bad nature. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to repent. But he was to be the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; He was to be the high priest. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me &gt;&gt; now? I want you to think of this in this manner. I I love how brother Brandham, you know, he's bringing this out and and how of this washing and I want just listen to this. I'm not going to post this quote, but listen to this. He said, "Think of how that the two great leaders of the hour, the Messiah and his prophet met in the water." This is he cares. Do you care? John was baptizing not for remission of sins but unto repentance. He said, "Because his offering had been made yet. And the sacrifice come to him in the water. And Jesus John looking up and seeing Jesus, he said, I have need to be baptized of thee. Why comest thou unto me?" And Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so." You you know this is in Matthew chapter 3. Which suffere it to be so. For thus it behooveth us be coming to us to fulfill all righteousness. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What that the sacrifice has got to be washed before it's received. Then John being a prophet on whom the word of the Lord come comes only to the prophet. John being a prophet understood that that was the sacrifice. And according to the law the sacrifice had to be washed before presented. And that's the reason he baptized him. He said this is, see, it behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness. Now, now applying that scripture to our own life, it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness. It is that of God calling us a as a child of God, of elect child of God. And it's us surrendering. It's us submitting to the call of the Holy Spirit coming through the word and to a real child of God. Now listen to me now. Jesus was the lamb before he ever came to the Jordan. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; The prophet picks it up in the token. He said, "See, he was a lamb all along." He said, "See the predestination in view." He was a lamb before he got there. That's the reason the dove could come to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, down beneath all of our wolfy natures, &gt;&gt; there was a predestinated seed. And that predestinated seed was a lamb that was on the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Right? Jesus said, "My sheep know my voice." That's why the prophet said, "You do not through the new birth become a sheep. You always were a sheep." &gt;&gt; Well, what changes? Your nature is changed. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. And the actual change of the nature is actually the death of the old nature &gt;&gt; and that new nature set in &gt;&gt; which God raising up that seed on the inside. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because remember God well I'm not I won't go there tonight because I want to stay there's so many different types and places to run but to understand brother Ram goes on to say he said now the sacrifice it must be wash in the labor talking about the brazen labor before presented for sacrifice and Jesus was the sacrifice and John knew it and he knew that he must be washed before presented and then immediately afterwards he was presented for the public for trial and was the sacrifice for all human life. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say it to you. The reason when Jesus, he knew when to come, you know how he knew when to come? Because the same Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; that calls you to the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; The prophet said the spirit sought him out in perfect obedience. You see, when God came down and became one of us, God so allowed himself to condescend to experience the wooing and the drawing of the spirit. &gt;&gt; You want me to read you the quote? Jesus was born the son of God to be Emanuel, God's expression in a man, and he found him in perfect obedience down at the River Jordan. And as soon as he obeyed him and walked out of the water, the heavens opened to John. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, that's the key. God's not going to open heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until there's been obedience to the simple things of his word. &gt;&gt; Are you talking about heavens being open? I'm talking about coming back into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Right? Because when God opens that, notice how Jesus was sought out. The prophet said, "In perfect obedience," he said, "Perfect obedience, the spirit had sought him out." I love how he says this, "Oh, weward man or woman, you there's something in you telling you that this is right." It's the Holy Spirit seeking you out &gt;&gt; to bring you to a knowledge of the truth of this hour. &gt;&gt; To bring you to the realization of what this is all about and who this is all about. The message is not a movement. [Music] &gt;&gt; The message is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You're not called to a man. You're not consecrated to a man. You're not consecrated to a building. You're not consecrated to a ministry. You're not consecrated to a city. &gt;&gt; You have been called in consecration to the word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Baptist doctrine will bear allegiance to Baptist doctrine. &gt;&gt; Pentecostals will bear allegiance to Pentecostal doctrine. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; And where did that doctrine come from? Where did that come from? To break him into three persons. I'll tell you where it came from. It came from hell. &gt;&gt; Your prophet called it the doctrines of devils. &gt;&gt; And it's the same one that speaks in the book of Revelation. Frogs and frogs are the only one that looks backwards. Looking backwards to Na Council where they split him up into three. It ain't three personalities. &gt;&gt; God's not a schizophrenic. Yeah, &gt;&gt; anybody in their right mind &gt;&gt; would know that. The prophet even said it like this. He said it don't even Christ the mystery. He said it don't even really take a revelation about water baptism. It's right there in the word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The part of revelation is where a person says, "Wow, what God has done for me, what he intends to do in my life that Christ might dwell in me." That's when it's a revelation &gt;&gt; because we can Bible study people and people can say, "I I see it. I see it. Where are they? Where are they? &gt;&gt; Where are they? Where are they?" It's not a revelation. &gt;&gt; See, friends, that's why we're not I'm not interested in talking people into this. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, you're not No. No. I believe in reaching out, but I don't believe in where I'm We're out here trying to wrangle people in. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's so good. And let me say this to you. If a person has believed the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation, praise God. It's not a secure position. &gt;&gt; It's not a secure position because the Bible said might be saved. It's not secure. &gt;&gt; There's only one place of security and that's in Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; That's one place of security. It's one place of safety and stability. But you know, going along with that, I thank God for salvation. But you see, this message never came to call us to the door and leave us at the door and wondering and fellowshipping around the door. The message of the hour came to call us into relationship. &gt;&gt; Why? That Christ, it's Christ and his bride might be made one. Now watch this. Brother Bram says it like this. He says, "Now in Revelations chapter 4 part three, before the sacrifices was burnt or accepted, they had to be washed. Before any sacrifice is received to God, it's first got to be washed. Not emotionally, but washed by the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. 9/11 produced a lot of emotionality. &gt;&gt; Let tragedy strike the nation. Emotionality, &gt;&gt; if that's even a word. &gt;&gt; And you give it after a period of time. When the emotion wears off, it's like a man who's drunk. When it wears off, it's done. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; It's not true. Because the real truth of the gospel not only brings us to the reality that Christ is our sin offering, our burnt offering, but it brings us to the reality of God's desire to dwell inside of us and to kill that old sin nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, notice he goes on. said, "Before we can ever come to God with true faith, we first got to come by the waters of separation." You've got to come by what? The word. That's why a person can never receive the Holy Ghost without believing the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; If you listen to me, if you've got disagreements with the word, you need to let God remedy all those disagreements. &gt;&gt; And don't just set us satisfy sitting under an anointing. You've got to have an anointing that goes down to your soul that makes you and anoints you with the sweetness of the rose of Sharon &gt;&gt; that changes your nature to where there's an amen on the inside of your life. That's where the anointing is to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not upset at anybody. I'm just very passionate. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I know sometimes I've seen myself I'm like dear God what I'm already ugly but Lord have mercy seeing the faces that's made within that time but you know friend what you know what the whole thing that what God you know what God was doing through the prophet and they in that hour got upset with him they got so upset with him they did not even want him to preach in their churches no more &gt;&gt; brother Brandham told him out in Arizona he says I know why you did it &gt;&gt; I know why you wouldn't have me &gt;&gt; even in the last meetings that we hear where he preaches such uh man just a a catalyst of messages. It's the invisible union of the bride of Christ. I've heard but now I see works as faith express on the wings of a snow white dove. Within those meetings, Jack Moore and them tried to get to him &gt;&gt; to stop him so he wouldn't preach no more. &gt;&gt; I'm not making that up, brother. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's a truth. &gt;&gt; But you know what? Remember brother Bam tells on tape? They were trying to find me for lunch and I was down the courtyard. They were up on my room and then I was up here and I was up here. Who was doing that? God. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz we needed those messages. Invisible union of the bride of Christ. We needed that works is made fa faith faith or works is faith expressed. We needed those words. &gt;&gt; So very &gt;&gt; glory be to God. And you know what? They didn't want to hear it no more. Right. &gt;&gt; They didn't want Pentecostalism being being called out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now listen, don't go to calling emotion Pentecostalism. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't got emotion, you're dead. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet, listen to me now, I can tell you multiple quotes. 1959 question answers is one. Oh, brother brother Brandham, I think so and so got in the flesh when they were dancing. They were this. said, "Look, I've seen many people that then I can look over and realize even speaking in tongues and other things." He said, "But I won't say nothing against it." He said, "What I say in my heart is God. They are a child of yours like I am, and they love you like I do, and they want to come where you are like I do." &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Bram says, "To say anything against it is blasphemy." &gt;&gt; I'm not making that up. See, that's respect. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember friends, suspicion is not discernment. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Then you've got to hear the word before you can enter there." You got because what does faith do? Faith opens up a clear way. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's like many times when I I watch within even in meetings, we're going into meetings. A lot of times it falls my lot to preach the you know the morning services and things and and thank God I always love I got the evangelist to follow after why I can teach in the morning. &gt;&gt; So they know what they're coming to. &gt;&gt; They know what to expect. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to know. That's why brother Bram says he talks about why why is the Holy Ghost? He said you can't receive it unless you know what it is. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And to know how it is to get it. So God, there there's an aspect of what the teaching of the word does. It allows us with the right expectation. What did Jesus do for 40 days? &gt;&gt; Did he preach to them for 40 days? &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was teaching them. Got quiet. Got quiet. What was he doing? He was giving them instruction. Right? &gt;&gt; Not only in what you're approaching as you're coming to and what it will do in your life, but then even the instruction that would come after the Holy Ghost has come. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; My my my so here the Lord Jesus becoming he was not only the sin offering but he is the burnt offering. Matter of fact, he's all of it. Every one of this, every one of these things within here, he was the burnt offering which was entirely burned upon the altar. He was the sweet smelling savor in the nostrils of God. God was pleased as it writes in Isaiah 53. He was satisfied with his offering. Right &gt;&gt; now, this is why I I'm not going to have time to read these scriptures, but I want you just to, you know, maybe refer to them, and they're very familiar scriptures to us, but this is why that Paul would write when he came among the Corinthians that he said, "I was with you in fear and trembling, lest your faith would stand in me." He said, "I didn't want your faith in me. I I I want your faith to stand in the power of God." &gt;&gt; Right? I say and Paul made this this statement. I know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. You say, brother Samuel, why was that so important? Well, it wasn't just talking about an event. But when Paul would preach the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ, it was the same way the spirit was in Peter. When Peter spoke of the present fulfillment that the atonement has come and the life of the atonement was delivering the message, it brought conviction in the heart of the believers that were listening to it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So Paul was setting forth that he is the all sufficiency. All was met in him. All that you have need of &gt;&gt; showing them that he is the way. This is why that Paul would write and he would say that God forbid I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world. Now let me just tell you something. It's more than just rallying around the cross of the Lord Jesus is to realize he spoke of your cross and my cross more than he ever did his own. &gt;&gt; That's right. That is so true. &gt;&gt; But if he didn't go to Calvary, you and I could not take up our cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no way that you and I could come to that place to so die to ourselves that the there were the spirit of God transforming us by the new birth. We could not come to that unless he was willing to drink his bitter cup. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? He He had to do that. He made a way for you and I. That's why he was saying, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." &gt;&gt; This is why, listen, this is why that Satan loves just to leave people looking at the cross. Oh, I thank God for the cross. Oh, I thank God for the cross. Well, I thank God for the cross, too. And I'm not taking away, friends. Sometimes there's things that where people can only see to a certain degree. But I'm talking to you. I'm preaching in a message church right here this morning to message believers, those that are called to take up your own cross and become united with Jesus Christ. Not just fellowship around the wonderful attributes, but what why did he go to Calvary? Why was his blood shed? Why did he suffer? Why did he do that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just to produce church groups, &gt;&gt; self-help seminars? &gt;&gt; Is that what he did? Did he die to produce Christian psychologist? &gt;&gt; Is that what he did? No wonder the prophet when he would stand there and say he'd seen the church &gt;&gt; of the world America. &gt;&gt; He said oh God see her she was naked. &gt;&gt; He said oh God &gt;&gt; is that you know what I love about the prophet? He never said is that the best they can produce for you. He said God is that the best we &gt;&gt; can produce for you. &gt;&gt; See he was laboring. This message was what? to have a bride dressed. &gt;&gt; And that dressear is the word upon our lives. &gt;&gt; Revelations 19, the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready to her was granted to be arrayed in the fine linen which is the righteousness of the saints to have on that wedding garment to have that seal to have that token in her life. Now watch. by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world. So, we don't want to just stop. Thank God for the cross, but to recognize what the cross did. It made a way for you and I to come into full relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Now, listen to me. I'm getting to some points now. Paul said in Galatians 3:1, "Oh, foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you?" Incredible. Paul was calling out witchcraft and sorcery among the church of God &gt;&gt; that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth and crucified among you. I want to remind you this last day church is led by a witch &gt;&gt; and they've got one that come right out of America. The Bible said out of her was sorceries. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's true. &gt;&gt; Blasphemous teachings. &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you, it's not just her. She's got daughters. &gt;&gt; Daughters that they taking on their own name. &gt;&gt; Confront them with the word. Well, my church says this. &gt;&gt; What does the word say? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, we teach this in a what does the word say? It's not about your church. We're not saved because we're identified with the church. There's only one place of safety, and that's under the blood. &gt;&gt; This is an hour of urgency, friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's an hour to say, God, let everything be clear. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let everything be clear. Let every channel, let every part of confusion be broken. &gt;&gt; Watch how the prophet takes us. If you haven't listened to this message in a while, I want you to listen to it. Going beyond the camp, I I don't know over the past weeks, I I don't know how many times I've went through this message. Brother Bram says, "More and more I am made to believe that people are not getting to Christ." And he said, "I'm here to help in every way that I can and make my statements as clear as I know how to make them. and you suffer with me if you will. Brother B says, "As I look and I preach across the nation and watch people, I am fully persuaded that the people are not getting to Christ." I believe that it's the enemy that's throwed this hindrance. Because the reason I believe this is he's not the object that they have been pointed to. They have either been pointed to a dogma, a doctrine, a party or experience or sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to Christ the word. &gt;&gt; That's why I think that people are resting their eternal destination upon some dogma, some sensation. I danced in the spirit. I spoke with tongues. I felt fire run over me. And do you know all those things can be impersonated by the devil? &gt;&gt; That's right. You know what? Pentecostals, they they couldn't stand this. Do you know why Jesus was put out of the lady in church? This is it right here. He is the word. They put him out. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; They put him out. They didn't want the life. Now, let me ask you something. If he's not there, who are they worshiping? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not throwing off on anybody. I'm just preaching the word. &gt;&gt; There's one thing that he cannot impersonate and that's the word. In the debate between the he and Jesus, each time Jesus defeated him, it is written in the word. &gt;&gt; Jesus never never defeated him on well, I felt this. All right, the Lord showed me this or this. You don't defeat the devil on that. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. You've got to defeat the devil knowing where you're standing on God's word and to know that his word is in your life and you are in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "I believe today the reason that people are not coming to Christ is because they're pointing many of them to a denomination. you come join our church, you read our catechism, believe our doctrine or some system of some sort, they are pointed in the wrong way and their action and the life that they live without Christ proves in their own life is vindicated by that very thing. Now watch, he's going to give the example. For instance, I don't want to hurt nobody's feeling, but back and forth across the nation, I have condemned women for wearing short hair. All right. &gt;&gt; And let me just remind you, when people talk about trimming the dead ends, that's one of the dumbest statements. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Cuz your hair don't grow from the end. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Into your head. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sorry for being so plain, but there's really, you know, we ought to be living in a time of plainness. That don't even make sense. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I mean, it don't, like brother Ben goes on to say, I've condemned women wear wearing shorts and using makeups. What? Let me tell you what made sense. If I came here and talked about how wrong it is to smoke because you, you know, notice, not only does the spirit of God condemn it, but even when brother talks about all those, you can see medical science, they even put it on the package warning carcinogens. &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up, friends. I can preach these things without reading quotes. &gt;&gt; But do you know makeup holds carcinogen properties? &gt;&gt; And you think God is pleased with that? There's only one woman who ever did that in the Bible, and she was named Jezebel. &gt;&gt; And she did that to appear before a man. You know why this church that's under the anointing of a Jezebel spirit that's decked with all this gold and decked with crosses? You know why they're doing that? To appear holy and righteous, but on the inside, full of dead men's bones, &gt;&gt; full of the martyrs and the blood of the saints. &gt;&gt; It's only a covering. Yes. &gt;&gt; But aren't you glad that God provided a greater covering for you and I? It ain't a covering that we smear on the outside, but it's a covering that'll deal with that old unbelief in our life. It'll rid sin nature from the inside and bring a liberty and a freedom from the inside because it's not about a garment on the outside. It's the garment on the inside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I've condemned women wearing shorts and using makeup, and every year it gets worse. It shows there's another finger somewhere. Not another finger here in this church. &gt;&gt; I'll continue to blast it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It shows that there's another finger somewhere. It might be another finger. Might be another. Oh, my my you know, my aunt said this or my daddy said this or my Whose voice are you going to take? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when you stand there that day, it will be nobody to stand there for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Mama won't be there. Daddy won't be there. But oh, what a blessed thing it is to say, God, I throw away my filthy rags. I'm willing to accept what the voice is saying by the spirit of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why, friends? Why? Is to bring cleansing in our lives. Lord, &gt;&gt; and they say, "We belong to a church. Our church don't." Well, don't make any difference what your church believes. God said it's wrong. &gt;&gt; And if they did get through to Christ, they would stop that. &gt;&gt; Not only that, but man would take his position if he got through on Christ and be against it. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Husbands wouldn't let their wives act like that. genuine man don't want his wife acting that way. Now, that don't mean to go in and, you know, you those of you that have believing power or unbel, you know, spouses that aren't walking in the truth, it don't mean you go in there and empty out, you know, her her paint and everything else or whatever. It means you live a life of a standard. And don't you compliment that thing? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because beauty ain't about ain't about what kind of coloring this and shading this and shading that. Real beauty is character on the inside. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Because after all, if God carries, we're all going to be a wrinkled mess. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Look like eventually paint on that looks like paint. You got to take the filing thing through and scrape it off the wall and do what? Get the primer and put some back on it. That's where they have the pickups and the let downs and all that other stuff, you know, going on. But if they got, listen, if they got through to Christ, listen to me now, they would stop that. &gt;&gt; It ain't about somebody saying, "Well, I'm going to quit this." That's not what he's saying. He's saying getting through to Christ and then the appetite of the world is gone. [Music] &gt;&gt; It must come through the blood. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, I want you to read this chapter when you get home. I don't have time to to to to to read it all. I would love to. But this second th second Thessalonians chapter 2, I want you to read this when you get home because this is the same chapter that speaks of the deception that even where that mystery of iniquity has been riding all the way down. That first writer, innocence, that white horse rider, it speaks of it coming into that place because Paul said the mystery of iniquity is already working. And Paul is going in to speak in this in this verse or this chapter 2 Thessalonians 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 that even uh him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceitfulness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved. &gt;&gt; Now what is the love of the truth? Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They did not receive the Holy Ghost. You see, they hadn't even been taught that. Well, brother Samuel, they've talked to them to born again, but they've been pointed wrongly. &gt;&gt; They've been taught that born again is to accept Christ. That's to have the same desires on the inside. That's not the new birth. &gt;&gt; There's got to come a cleansing. The Holy Spirit will not come down on unclean desires, &gt;&gt; but it takes more of the Holy Ghost to burn out those unclean desires &gt;&gt; that then the Holy Spirit might fill and put in service what he has cleaned and set aside for service. Is that right? Now, notice we've got to come through come through that of the blood. Now, Brother Brandham is pointing this out because we're living in the day where where Christ and his people becoming one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Wherein that Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I'll build my church." Well, the temple of God in in when we're not looking for another step, we are called to ascend to that of brotherly kindness and the capstone coming down in rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I it it it's God's capstone revelation that's drawing us up into that because he said upon this rock I'll build my church. What is his church? His tabernacle, his dwelling place. Right? &gt;&gt; So God, what what is he going that's what Revelations 4 is all about. It's about the dwelling place. It's about the tabernacle of God being taken in rapture. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Now this is why this this revelation Paul gave in that hour talking about that mystery of iniquity. How many remembers John said in 1 John, I think it's 1 John chapter 4 where it said, "Beloved, tri spirit." How many know that? &gt;&gt; Why? Because the antichrist spirit was already among them, &gt;&gt; right? Everything was right there. The mystery of iniquity, all of that. What was it doing? It was it was trying and working to turn people away from the real true experience of the Holy Ghost dwelling in their lives. You know, there were some men I I thank God those testimonies included. There were some men that remember they came to brother Brandham and they well they were standing on the word as far as all they knew. &gt;&gt; Remember the one who was the dean of that college spoke real bad of brother Brandham. Brother Brandham wrote turned back the letter and said, "Now dear brother, I know you didn't mean that. You're a servant of God like I am and you've been serving God a lot longer. Matter of fact, you was preaching before I was born. Brother Ram just, you know, just so compliment. And with that response, that man invited brother Brandham to come to that college and they had that discussion where he's saying, "Brother Brandham, we've believed. What more can you do?" He said, "Well, brother," he said, "That's right." He said, "But remember, God gave Abraham the seal of circumcision, showing him he had received his faith. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram took took that man. Remember, brother Bram tells a story. He took that dean to that college and the rest of those students. Let me just tell you something right now. There was some hearts that was honest to look in the word. You know what they were more interested in? They were more interested instead of relying on previous experiences to look in the word. &gt;&gt; That's where Pentecostals failed. They wanted to when the word came to the showdown, the word began to deal with that there's still something not right in your life. this up and down in your nature and the love for the world. Something's not right. Well, I spoke in tonesues. Remember, Brother Brand said that one lady's wearing shorts. He said, "And she spoke in tongues." He said, "You try to tell her she don't got the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Why? What's she relying on? Anointing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the anointing follows the blood down into the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just to be on here on the outer realm where it can come and go. True. We feel God's presence come and go, but when that anointing is on the soul, it's there to guide you and direct you even when you don't &gt;&gt; feel it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's where the mana is in the golden ome it won't corrupt and get maggots in it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost can't fade away right there. It's it's there present in that life. This is why in the scripture Paul said, "We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth, where to he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ." Now, I want you to think about this. Brother Brandham in in bringing this with predestination in the message the future home he says you weren't saved on any certain day you were always saved &gt;&gt; you've just recognized it &gt;&gt; how does the person recognize that the spirit of God draws them through the process this God takes them here they stand washed repentance water baptism and I'm not just listen I I don't want you to think of this as just oh I come and do this step and I come and do this step that won't work it's got to be faith &gt;&gt; it's got to be from your heart &gt;&gt; everything is it's from your heart &gt;&gt; God drawing upon the heart to move from one step to another with with what the full desire is. Lord, I want to be one with you. &gt;&gt; Right? I want to be one with you. So God provided a way that we can come back to that. And what that revelation breaks forth on our life, you were always saved. It doesn't mean that a person doesn't have to repent. As a matter of fact, it's because of that you will repent. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean, well, I don't need to be sanctified. I know this is very simple. It means that that's the reason you want to be sanctified. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean, well, I don't need the Holy Ghost. I was already saved. No, you you need the Holy Ghost. It's the Holy Ghost leading you all the way. And if you are a part of that, clear back from the mind of God, you will desire the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet said God knew that you would be here in this meeting tonight. &gt;&gt; And he knew you would be desiring the Holy Ghost. He said he knew that I would be standing here preaching what I'm preaching. And he made a way that you could receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's the Holy Spirit that brings us back into the presence of God, &gt;&gt; back into our homelands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just Can I read just a few more statements here? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is why with him coming back into that into that place with God to where that the blood itself, brother Brandham tells us here in going beyond the camp, he said, I know there's some reason that people are not getting through to Christ. If they would, they wouldn't act like it. Now, let me just say this sometimes, remember brother Ram says a son can go a long time &gt;&gt; before they recognize they're a son, &gt;&gt; right? A person can set underneath the word for a long time. So don't don't ever discount Someone said, "Well, they must not be elect." You don't know that. &gt;&gt; Remember I told you here this lady was 99 years old. I don't know how many meetings she sat in. I don't know how many I I don't know. &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Brandham tells us in the message um redeeming redemption. He said, "As a young man, I wanted to get right with God." And he said, "I went to churches." He said, "But none of them made an altar call." That's what he said. &gt;&gt; He said, "I went there." Now remember, brother Brandham here, he comes outside. Remember, he nails a note, you know, to the tree and so forth. What I'm trying to say to you is is that how that God comes down to open the way for his children to come back home. But the Ram says, I I know there's some reason that people are not getting through to Christ. If they would, they wouldn't act like that. It may So it may it may go for a period of time, but I was just going to say this to you as well, that every elect will come to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why we don't go around here and putting people in headlocks. &gt;&gt; Right. Listen, I I just want you to understand that's why I'm not preaching fear. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're put into a position under, oh, the fear of hell. Hell's a real place. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, it's real. &gt;&gt; It is real. The prophet saw it expressed on earth. &gt;&gt; But listen, God, you you can't serve God by being afraid of hell. &gt;&gt; No, that's right. It's the wrong reason. Right. &gt;&gt; It's like marrying the first man that comes along only because you don't want to be an old maid. &gt;&gt; It ain't right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; If you want better examples, you have to ask and praying God. But it's true. I mean, that that ain't even real. That ain't even real love. You just I don't want to be an old maid. Yeah. I just marry the first one that comes along. That that ain't why we don't serve God out of fear. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid I'll go to hell. That's not real service. That's fear. &gt;&gt; That's right. And perfect love is to cast out all fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? To where that you're standing there, God's desire is to bring you to a place to where everybody else, if God said, "There's one right here and there's one in this city." Sorry, I hate to disappoint the rest of you, but this is the guy right here that's going. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that just to be that's how I feel. &gt;&gt; If there's only one, that's me. &gt;&gt; That's how you have to feel. That's how you have to feel. If there's one in your house, you have to say, "I'm that one." &gt;&gt; Come on. You know I'm pulling from quotes here. &gt;&gt; The whole purpose of that statement being made is for you and I to walk with a certainty because the experience is an individual personal experience. Not a group revelation, not a church affiliation, but a personal vindicated experience of the Holy Spirit in your life that you know you pass from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bram said Jesus suffered without the gates that he might sanctify his people with his own blood. Sanctification comes from the Greek word means cleaned and set aside for service. And when God cleans his people with the blood of Jesus, he cleans them from the filth of the world and sets them aside for service. Brother Brandham said, I was talking about Matthew 17, Mount Transfiguration. Remember how Peter said, "It's good to be here. Let's build three tabernacles." Peter wasn't catching what it was all about. &gt;&gt; He was enthused. &gt;&gt; You know what Peter was a type of? The Pentecostals. They got enthused. The prophet said, "The supernatural excites the human emotion." &gt;&gt; Now, I know people take that quote and they'll run it all the way down and if there's any type of emotion, they want to tie that. No, that's not how Brother Brown was saying, &gt;&gt; missing the whole point whatsoever. Because you can't have, listen, you can't have the prophet saying that and then have this same prophet being the one when he comes to himself sitting on his podium with his legs dangling over it and thinking, "How did I get here?" He said, "But I just began to think about the goodness of God and think about what God had done for me." He got beside himself. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. The prophet said he got right down there in the floor. Remember, he said he was criticizing those that was dancing. Why are they doing that in my church? Why are they doing that in my church? Brother Bram said, "Before I knew it, I was out on the floor. Had my shoes and my socks off and my trouser legs rolled up." Woo! Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, Brother Samuel, we just believe in the word. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; I don't have time to chase that rabbit this morning. I do, too. But I believe in the living word. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in the in a word that just is, you know, produces a bunch of monks. I believe a living word that produces a real shout in our life, a real living reality. There's a joy in our life. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. That's what the real Holy Ghost comes to do is bring a real joy. Jesus said, "My joy I leave with you." It don't mean you got to dance or you got to run, but you've got a joy that you know you pass from death unto life. It don't matter what you're facing in life. You know in whom you have believed and persuaded that he is able. I have passed from death unto life. I have met God's requirements &gt;&gt; and I have the token. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He's our joy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not if the Buckeyes win. &gt;&gt; Not if the Browns finally have a winning season. &gt;&gt; Now listen. Is it against those things? &gt;&gt; No. But neither should that be your source. &gt;&gt; If that's your source, you got to change sources. &gt;&gt; You got to change sources because there's got to have a living source. A source that you can draw that others can draw from you from that living source. &gt;&gt; Let me just shut it down here. &gt;&gt; There's no way to come to a stop. You just would jump off. But the spirit bade them not to do it. Don't build. Don't you build tabernacles. Don't you exalt men. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't you exalt the law, the prophets. I mean, think about it. Can you imagine? Listen, they have seen so many wonderful things and they're standing there and seeing Moses and Elijah. How many people &gt;&gt; have been able to say that in between in their generation? nobody. &gt;&gt; And they're able to say, "We've seen Moses and Elijah." &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Let's build three tabernacles." &gt;&gt; He was enthused. &gt;&gt; But this this was not it was not Mount Transfiguration was not about exalting the prophets. It was not about exalting the law. It was about God himself declaring through the adoption of his son that the law and God's justice has been met in the person of Jesus Christ and he is the word. Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's what this message has brought us to is a mount transfiguration. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it brings every one of us to a personal mount transfiguration experience. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Bringing us to adoption in our own lives. Right? &gt;&gt; But it's an adoption message. &gt;&gt; We're under the authority not not of man's teachings. We're under the authority of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Stay with me. I'm wrapping it up. I'm just This part I'm jumping off. I'm trying to jump off now. Tray tables are up. Seat belts are buckled. But the same pillar of fire, think about this now. The same pillar of fire who wrote the word has come in the end time to interpret the word. &gt;&gt; Here were the seminaries. The pillar of fire goes clear back to the mind of God and begins to reveal the contents &gt;&gt; of the book. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says, "Well, this one said this. Moody said this. Moody said this." Brother Brham says, "What do they have to do with this? It's the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's who's come in our midst. &gt;&gt; Now hear you him. That's who we're to look to. The word, not our enthusiasm or something. So the message is not about getting us all enthused. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes there's things where that that's been wrong. You know, you've get people that are they're always conspiracy theorist. The government's doing this. The government's doing that. The government's doing this. the government. &gt;&gt; I don't have time for that stuff. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be honest with you. I don't got time for it. &gt;&gt; I don't want to sit and listen to it. &gt;&gt; I don't have time for it. &gt;&gt; Good preaching. &gt;&gt; You choose what you're going to give time to &gt;&gt; because let me tell you what, them conspiracy theories are spirits. &gt;&gt; Eventually, you'll be questioning everything else. &gt;&gt; Let me share this why it's coming. Then somebody that sent all this stuff about flat earth stuff and it pulled up. I was laying, you know, I'm very choosy about what I watch and what I look and give myself my time to. I don't like my thoughts interrupted. I don't like the channels I'm studying in interrupted. No, that's me. You can say, "Brother Sam, you pick your one or more. I know the veins that I'm studying in for the Thursdays, the Sundays, and meetings. I know all the and I don't want I don't want to be I don't want my my channels and what God has placed for here. I I don't my interest." So there's there's a lot of things I don't want things taking my thoughts away. But I got my wife started pulling up some of them. This person was sinning left and right. And I I was sitting laying on a couch on a Sunday evening. This is years ago. I sat up on that couch. I said, "Honey, the same spirits that are behind that are the same devils on that believe the sign." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't but about a few months turns of the clock. They no longer were standing for the message. I'm telling you, it's devils. &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about flat earth. I'm talking about spirits that want to lead and take people astray. You know, it's a spirit that would even get in your mind and say, "Oh, he's over the top. This message is over the top. You don't need to." That's not God telling you that. That's right. &gt;&gt; If I've presented the word to you right here and I've only got to a certain place, but presenting the word that the anointing follows the blood with what? Later scripture coming in there. You've got to apply the blood &gt;&gt; to your life. &gt;&gt; You've got to take this message and apply it to your life. &gt;&gt; You've got to take it and come under it. It had to apply the blood to the right ear &gt;&gt; so they could hear the right way. had to apply it to the right thumb so they could handle the right way. Had to apply it to the right big toe. It had to be applied to their lives. And once the blood of the consecration was applied, then the anointing could come on their life. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham in the token message says you must apply the blood before the spirit will come. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to apply the blood? It means to obey the voice &gt;&gt; of the blood which is the word &gt;&gt; and submit to it and let the word let it cleanse you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it come under that blood. Submit to it. Don't don't wrestle to with it. But you see this is where in our hearts let's stand. This is where in our hearts brother Brandham one of one of the places in the message the comforter brother Ram will take that scripture of whom the world cannot receive. Now brother Bram will really dive into that in a church age book. But in that message the comforter brother Brandham says see whom the world can't receive. He said see what it is if you still love the world. He can't come. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Sam, well, how do I get rid of that love of the world?" That because well, that love is arising from that first nature. &gt;&gt; But remember, the prophet tells us in souls in prison. Now, when God can get that first nature to agree with his word, he kills it and raises up &gt;&gt; that new nature &gt;&gt; on the inside. Because that new nature is that seed. It's that womb, that pre-prepared ground for the word to fall in. You know what happens when the when the word I you know you know how it is when God got a hold of your life and begin to draw your life and man you're you're going through I mean you're just in love with him. You're not even you're not even you're not even worried about at first like where am I at? What am I doing? You just you're just in you're caught up with him. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. and you're watching how the word you're just you're feeding you're you're taking in the word and you're watching things just desires just flee out of your life &gt;&gt; so &gt;&gt; it's not something you're trying to do but what what's doing it you're applying the blood &gt;&gt; that is so good &gt;&gt; as you're giving yourself to the word the word the word it's a bleeding word that holds cleansing power &gt;&gt; it begins to cleanse you're like I don't know why don't I mean it's like maybe you you know all of a sudden you you like a certain thing or doing and you're It's not even really it just it flees the the actual the desire what is what's doing that it's the blood that's cleansing &gt;&gt; and as the blood is being applied the word is being applied to your life. This is why, listen friends, listen. This is why yes, it's a late hour and it's a time to be very serious and to be very urgent, but to understand that even if we were we were sitting right here before the word this morning and if you said, "Brother Samuel, I still have some things that I like that I enjoy." Well, you know what? Don't misunderstand me, but I'll say, "God bless you for being honest. But now that honesty, take it to the blood. &gt;&gt; Submit to the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And begin to say, "Lord, cleanse me." &gt;&gt; See, God's not just coming to cleanse you of attributes like we talked about, you know, makeup and shorts and other those are attributes. Smoking, drinking, those are all attributes of one symptom, unbelief. That's what the blood come to do is deal with the root of the problem is unbelief and bring us to a genuine faith in God's word where it comes to the place God brings us to that place that all the only desire Lord I just want to please you &gt;&gt; our lives have been employed by the spirit of God put into service the anointing has put us into service and we see the word working in our life we see that our lives have been have been changed. It's it's not just that, well, I don't smoke no more. I don't drink no more. I listen, I thank God for that. That's sanctification. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to ask you, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, friends? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you want to serve him with all your heart? &gt;&gt; Do you want to be one with him? &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's more than just well I used to smoke I don't smoke no more I used to drink I that there's it's deeper than that &gt;&gt; but has he become the love of your life when he's become the very love of your life that's where the anointing has followed the blood &gt;&gt; listen friends he's not here God hasn't come and if you isn't about shaming It's about being united. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil misinterpret the word. It's about uniting. We're We're going somewhere. &gt;&gt; I'm not planning on staying here. &gt;&gt; This is This is not my home. I'm You know, I I'm looking forward to the change. I'm looking forward to the rapture. I'm expecting my daddy to walk in any morning. &gt;&gt; I'm expecting my loved ones. I'm expecting to see Brother Herb, Sister Joe, &gt;&gt; Brother Carper. I'm expecting to see our loved ones. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's went on. I'm expecting that. &gt;&gt; But there's a question. Do you love him? Is he your everything? &gt;&gt; Now I realize, friends, sometimes love it can sometimes get a little cold. And if it does, with that being in your heart, you'll say, "God, I want to rekindle that, Lord. Because your desire is I don't want anything between me and him. &gt;&gt; Because really, where are you getting that desire from? That's from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon says the statue of a perfect man, one of the opening quotes, he said, "Anyone who's ever really come and fallen in love with the Lord Jesus Christ, it's something about it." He said, "You just can't get enough of him." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That is so true. &gt;&gt; You can't get enough of him. So I ask you to evaluate if if if if it's become that oh church and oh here in the same old thing you might need to evaluate &gt;&gt; if it's become something to where that oh it's just those people and that evaluate listen your soul is worth you evaluating &gt;&gt; as much as you would check the reviews on a restaurant on Yelp before ever spending money. You will you will take time. Don't tell me you don't do it. I know many of you do it. I do it, too. &gt;&gt; I want to know when I go into an area, I want to know what are they saying about the stars on this restaurant. &gt;&gt; Why don't you let the Holy Spirit say, "Lord, what about in my life?" &gt;&gt; Is my life lining up with those stars that Brother Ronnie preached about last week? &gt;&gt; Is it lining up? Is it pressing on to the high calling? Oh, friends, God didn't come to just give us good messages. Right. &gt;&gt; God didn't come to give us just, you know, me just, you know, just to massage our shoulders and mind make us feel good. That ain't what the message is about. &gt;&gt; The message is to call us up higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's called us up higher. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Just let the spirit of God just let him just evaluate. I know. I know. Just let him evaluate. Be honest. Be sober. This is a moment to be sober. to be honest and to let the spirit of God just just move through your life. Even as we'll take this word, God carries and we'll leave from here. I'll pray with anybody wants to need prayer, sickness, or you you you need you have a need in your life, we're here to pray with you. But don't let this word pass from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like the man who was coming around the mountain and when the one was bragging how close he could come to the edge, this other little guy said, "I don't see how far I can get to the edge." She said, "I I just stay climb tight to the mountain." &gt;&gt; And the guy said, "You're the guy I want to take me around. &gt;&gt; We don't need anybody proven skills. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; I just want to stay close to him." &gt;&gt; I want to stay close to him. Because I'll tell you why. If there's any any life to come, if there's any birth, if there's any transformation, it's going to come from him. &gt;&gt; And it'll come through surrendered vessels. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that how you want to be as a husband? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. as a mom, as a dad, grandparent, want to be a real example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, my grandchild or my child, you know, there the blood's not been applied to them yet. But remember, the prophet said you're to be their Holy Ghost until they get old enough to receive it. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That you're to apply it over their life. &gt;&gt; If there's things that you would not do in your own life, don't buy it for them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't condone it for them. That's called applying &gt;&gt; the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, they don't understand this. Applying the blood is you who has the blood on display in your heart by the spirit of God. Don't compromise. Hold the standard. You love him. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. As every head is bowed, I want every eye to be closed. Please, no looking around. Wonder how many would want to just be remembered in prayer. And I just put it in that way. You let the spirit of God just speak to your heart this morning. Sure. I know we all need to go. There's not I don't want to say all, but we want to go deeper. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I want I wanted I want to be more like him. I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But maybe there's hands this morning to say, "Lord, you know how you spoke to my heart. I want the blood applied because I know the anointing will follow the blood. Brother Samuel, is it that simple? Yeah, it's that simple. I was going to read you a quote here, but there's no way I even got near it. Maybe I'll read it or play it for you next week. Just a simple prayer, Brother Brandham guides them through at the end of token. It's that simple. Say, Lord, take everything from my life that's unlike you, Lord. Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord God. Take every desire. Take everything, Lord, that would separate, Lord, that would keep. Lord, let the blood I I submit to this word. I submit to you, Lord. [Music] I want to be filled, Lord, through and through. Lord, my hands, Lord God, is up, Lord Jesus, as well. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray, Lord Jesus. I'm asking you, Lord, to forgive me, Lord, for my wrongs, Lord. Lord God, cleanse us, Lord. I pray, Lord, right here this morning. Take us deeper, Lord. I I want, Lord, a refilling. &gt;&gt; I want a refilling. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just something Lord that we come to just every so many days but God to realize we have an access. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God sometimes when life is so overwhelming sometimes Lord God with the trials and the test the burdens of life but Lord we don't want to just wait till it gets to that point. But I'm thankful that God, you call us. There's a yearning. There's a desire. I want a fresh refilling. Lord, I know, Lord, throughout this building, Lord God, there's no doubt many, Lord God, that Father, you have so sealed their lives. But that longing is over and over they continue to present themselves before the word because they want to be a partaker of your divine nature. There's a desire, Lord God, to continue to draw down into their lives, more of you, Lord, to allow our lives to be evaluated, to be scanned, as it were, by the word. Lord, where are my shortcomings? Where am I falling short, Lord? Where can I pick it up, Lord? Lord, the weak areas, Lord God, places, Lord God, like your prophet said, where the devil's got a punch coming, keep it covered with the blood at all times, &gt;&gt; Lord God, recognizing that as sons and daughters of God, we're not super people as far as in our outward, but Lord God, it's that on the inside when the blood has been applied and the spirit has come and the prophet said, "You're a super super super super super super super human being because it's supernatural life living on the inside. Supernatural, Lord God, how you move through our lives, Lord God, how you lead us in your word. It's supernatural, Lord God, to wear, Father, when we are down, Lord God, and you, Lord Jesus, would send one of your angels by, Lord God, and drop a word to us, Lord. Oh God, how we thank you Lord. We love you, Father. How Lord God, how we're thankful. We're thankful every time you've corrected us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not just in church. No, we don't have to wait till we get to church to be corrected. But Lord, to be so in tune with you, as the prophet said, Lord, I want to be so in tune with you to where I would know the least little thing that you would be grieved at. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to know that way. I want to know you in that way. Like a husband and a wife would know one another. No, he likes this. He don't like that. He likes this. He likes this this way. He likes it on this side of the plate. Fork on this side. Can't turn this way. She knows. Oh, God. Granted, Lord Jesus, this is our desire, Lord. We want to please you. How wonderful it is, Lord, to be in fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; Now, Lord God, I pray behind every hand that was lifted, Lord God, may you move down. I pray Lord Jesus and according to every request that's on the hearts of your children, Lord God, as they Lord would believe your word and say amen to the word. Oh God, they're not ashamed of the word but to say amen to it. Lord, I give myself to this word. Lord, cleanse me, Lord God. Let the word cleanse every desire from my life. Lord, I want to be one with you, Lord God. I want to be one, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Maybe, Lord, his hearts are setting right here that God, they have that testimony. &gt;&gt; I've been cleansed of this, cleansed of that. God has cleansed me and set me free of habits, but Lord God, they realize that love is really not where it needs to be. That's right. May you, Lord, I pray God, take them deeper, Lord God, through their willingness, Lord God, an acknowledgment to say, Lord, I want to be one with you. The same one that justified me, the same one who sanctified me. It's all with the purpose to be united with you. Lord God, I want real joy in my life. Maybe that's your prayer.
