[27:19] still a mate's tonight aren't we it's
[27:29] always you know times when we have to
[27:33] really appreciate the times when you're
[27:36] able to come together and we just just
[27:40] something very special
[27:41] as as believers the privilege that we
[27:44] have to be able to assemble together in
[27:46] the name of the Lord then bring our
[27:49] licks of fire together and what the Lord
[27:52] will do in our midst and how that he
[27:55] works in our life is just something
[27:56] special to us you know coming to church
[27:59] is not a ritual to our lives it's not
[28:02] something that's you know we look at and
[28:05] say well I think I can fit it in but
[28:06] it's it's what we base everything around
[28:09] you know with in reality that's why we
[28:12] make decisions about jobs or we make
[28:14] decisions about whether this can be done
[28:16] or that can be done we we look at and
[28:18] say will this interfere with church well
[28:20] you know if it interferes with church
[28:21] then sorry we can't do it
[28:24] amen and I'm so thankful that God is so
[28:28] placed that within our hearts it's just
[28:30] such a privilege to be in the house of
[28:32] the Lord tonight and we just want to
[28:34] look right into the word and ask if
[28:37] you'll just turn with us to Exodus 14
[28:38] and as you're turning there I want to
[28:42] just mention to your Lord willing this
[28:44] coming weekend family and I we be gone
[28:48] and ministering and brother Brandon
[28:52] Senna Cola will be coming over and he'll
[28:55] be ministering here in the Assembly and
[28:59] just keep us in prayer Lord willing
[29:01] we'll be down and bluffed in this this
[29:03] weekend and so you just keep us in
[29:05] prayer if you would
[29:08] it's hard with missing last Sunday
[29:12] because I've got everything bottled up
[29:16] so I have this old wait till we get back
[29:19] but let's look at this here tonight and
[29:21] Exodus 14 verse 10 and when Pharaoh
[29:27] drew nigh the children of Israel lifted
[29:32] up their eyes and behold the Egyptians
[29:35] marched after them and they were sore
[29:39] afraid and the children of Israel cried
[29:41] out unto the Lord that's the right thing
[29:45] to do I said that's the right thing to
[29:48] do they cry out unto the Lord if that
[29:51] would have been right there where they
[29:53] stopped but then they said unto Moses
[29:57] because there were no graves in Egypt
[29:59] has thou taken us away to die in the
[30:03] wilderness
[30:04] wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us
[30:07] to carry us forth out of Egypt is not
[30:11] this the word that we did tell thee in
[30:13] Egypt saying let us alone
[30:15] that we may serve the Egyptians for it
[30:18] had been better for us to serve the
[30:20] Egyptians than that we should die in the
[30:24] wilderness Moses said unto the people
[30:27] fear you not stand still and see the
[30:32] salvation of the Lord which he will show
[30:36] to you today what do I have to do stand
[30:42] still
[30:45] that's it stand still and see behold
[30:49] the salvation of the Lord which he will
[30:53] show to you today for the Egyptians whom
[30:56] you have seen today you shall see them
[30:59] again no more forever the Lord shall
[31:04] fight for you and ye shall hold your
[31:08] peace amen and amen amen
[31:14] let's just bow our heads tonight amen
[31:17] anyone want to be remembered in prayer
[31:19] maybe a need on your heart or something
[31:21] before the Lord let's just go before him
[31:24] tonight let's pray for one another
[31:26] Lord Jesus father we're just so thankful
[31:30] that you Lord have made a way for us or
[31:33] God to come Lord into your presence Lord
[31:36] we're thankful Lord God to be standing
[31:39] or God in your presence tonight and
[31:41] father we believe oh god that this is
[31:44] where that Lord that we have been
[31:46] gathered Lord in you and Lord were
[31:49] thankful that you gave us Lord the
[31:51] opening an opportunity to be able to
[31:54] come to the house of God Lord I know
[31:57] throughout Sunday Lord there were Lord
[31:59] just true churches Lord that were
[32:02] canceled Lord all the way and Lord
[32:04] different ones clear down into Arkansas
[32:06] in different places Lord that were just
[32:08] canceled Lord from the way that the
[32:10] weather had hit but father we're just
[32:12] thankful that you made a way tonight
[32:14] Lord we just pray that Lord that you
[32:17] would come Lord tonight and would you
[32:19] just take us Lord take your word and
[32:22] speak to us Lord what it is that you
[32:25] want to say to us Lord father we know
[32:28] that it will take more dear Lord God
[32:30] than just a gift it'll take Lord the
[32:32] gift being used by you father Lord to
[32:35] minister Lord to your people father so
[32:38] Lord we ask that you would come Lord
[32:40] minister to every need Lord those that
[32:43] are behind the uplifted hands father Oh
[32:45] God tonight Lord we've come expecting
[32:48] Lord God to father Lord to see you
[32:51] father and to hear from you Lord we just
[32:53] set our needs before you Lord be leaving
[32:56] dear God that you're all that we have
[32:58] Father and we ask Lord God for your
[33:01] blessing now upon your word in the name
[33:03] of Jesus Christ amen amen God blesses
[33:07] your being seated I look here in the
[33:14] scripture and I want to the Lord will
[33:18] help us tonight I'd like to look at that
[33:20] portion of verse 13 and Moses said unto
[33:25] the people fear you not stand still and
[33:28] see the salvation of the Lord which he
[33:31] will show to you today you know when you
[33:38] you look at this within the word as we
[33:41] were touching upon this last week and
[33:45] you know it's just one of those things
[33:48] that you just wasn't even thinking of
[33:50] passing this way it was going straight
[33:51] over into the first place there at Marah
[33:54] and that's what I had been studying for
[33:56] months and looking for there and then
[33:59] how the Holy Spirit picks this up and
[34:00] then when those things get brought
[34:02] before you and I feel like not
[34:03] everything that's set in before me and
[34:05] there's no way in the world that we'll
[34:07] be able to break into what it is that
[34:10] that God just seemed to be quickening
[34:11] last week but nonetheless the Lord had
[34:15] his way and when we look at this here
[34:17] tonight you know and we think about this
[34:20] in the scripture of where that the
[34:22] people themselves had come to and how
[34:25] that God would instruct the people to
[34:27] stand still you know it's not the first
[34:29] time through the Scriptures or would it
[34:31] be the first time that God would
[34:34] actually direct his people time and time
[34:36] again
[34:37] to stand still you find it in countless
[34:40] times through the Scriptures when Israel
[34:42] and different ones would come upon
[34:44] different battles and things that were
[34:46] more than what they themselves knew what
[34:49] to do with when you look in a situation
[34:52] like this in 2nd chronicles 20 verse 17
[34:55] if here was a time when mohab was
[34:57] invading Israel Jehoshaphat is the king
[35:00] and you find that here within Judah
[35:02] how that they had went before the Lord
[35:04] and then a man by the name of jahaziel
[35:06] there one of the Levites the Spirit of
[35:08] God came upon
[35:10] and he begin to prophesy and say you
[35:12] shall not need to fight in this battle
[35:14] set yourselves stand you still and see
[35:18] the salvation of the Lord with you o
[35:20] Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be
[35:23] dismayed tomorrow go out against them
[35:25] for the Lord will be with you you find
[35:29] in another place which many of us can
[35:31] identify with where job was in the heat
[35:33] and thick of the trials and tests and
[35:35] remember ivory everyone had already
[35:37] spoke bill daddy live as and Joel had
[35:40] tried to go back and forth with them and
[35:42] so forth to where that they had got job
[35:45] you know to where that job was still
[35:46] standing on his sacrifice but Joe had
[35:49] been able to be affected by the things
[35:51] that they were saying to wear that as
[35:53] they remember those men were looking at
[35:56] the goodness of themselves or how a
[35:58] person would be good that if you're good
[36:00] there will be no test there'll be no
[36:02] trials and so they were actually
[36:04] portraying self-made righteousness and
[36:07] remember Ella who was there the whole
[36:09] time but he didn't speak up until each
[36:12] of them he said I figured that the
[36:13] ancients should speak first because
[36:16] wisdom should speak but then you find
[36:19] when Ella who begins to break forth and
[36:21] begins to speak he takes you know the
[36:24] very the very direction within the word
[36:27] and would cause job to consider things
[36:29] that was all around job things that
[36:32] would seem so small and insignificant
[36:34] like that of the clouds how the clouds
[36:37] would form how even the snow would form
[36:39] how even though rain drop the dew drops
[36:41] all these things that you know Joe would
[36:43] would overlook and not willingly but
[36:45] evens and consider God's care and
[36:48] direction to wear that Ella who would
[36:50] tell him in this statement of job 37:14
[36:53] hearken unto this old job stand still
[36:56] and consider the wondrous works of God
[36:58] I'll tell you that's a miracle when
[37:00] we're in the midst of tests and trials
[37:02] we need to hear from Ella who we need to
[37:05] hear from the Lord to help us today
[37:07] just stand still just just stand still
[37:10] because we hear so much we've got this
[37:12] rumor we've got this thought we've got
[37:14] this things you've got you're surrounded
[37:16] by all sorts of things voices are flying
[37:18] left and right but here in the midst of
[37:20] it remember now
[37:21] just stand still settle down calm down
[37:24] and just let's hear what God has to say
[37:27] think about it even when here when
[37:29] Israel had actually you know chosen Saul
[37:32] to be the king Samuel would actually
[37:35] rehearse before the people after that
[37:38] they had already chosen so and I found
[37:40] this to be very remarkable of how Samuel
[37:43] would say to the people in 1st Samuel 12
[37:46] it is the Lord that advanced Moses and
[37:48] Aaron and that brought your fathers up
[37:51] out of the land of Egypt you find over
[37:53] and over in the scriptures this God is
[37:56] new you know God doesn't do anything
[37:57] just to be doing it he doesn't say
[38:00] anything just to be saying you know to
[38:03] think about it throughout the scriptures
[38:05] this is something that would be
[38:07] rehearsed as a part of Israel's heritage
[38:10] as a matter of fact so many things of
[38:13] the Psalms that we read that are
[38:15] actually sung within certain times a
[38:18] memorial in the feast within Israel
[38:20] these are not things that are just
[38:22] happenings or just mere scriptures or
[38:24] just mere songs these actually have a
[38:27] significant meaning to them when they're
[38:30] singing them to where that even Samuel
[38:32] moved by the Spirit of God how many
[38:34] times have we read this here of how that
[38:37] it is brought to the attention it is the
[38:39] Lord that brought you out of Egypt now
[38:42] you would think you know that how many
[38:44] times God said that over and over in the
[38:47] book of Exodus he says it over and over
[38:49] in the Book of Numbers he actually says
[38:52] it over and over in the book of
[38:53] Deuteronomy he'll say it through each
[38:56] and every one of them Nehemiah Ezra
[38:57] Micah all the way on down through there
[39:00] why it is needful for them to remember
[39:03] that it is the Lord who brought them out
[39:07] of Egypt or in one place he would say
[39:09] out of the iron furnace and I believe
[39:12] that we can never ever let us never get
[39:15] too big that we forget that it's the
[39:18] Lord that brought us out and the same
[39:21] Lord who brought us out is the same Lord
[39:23] who takes us in now I know that we've
[39:25] been brought out and we're taken into
[39:27] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:29] but we also know that there is an actual
[39:32] catching away
[39:34] going into there is a body there is a
[39:36] rapture that is waiting and that is
[39:39] promised and that we are a part of what
[39:42] the church has looked forward to and you
[39:44] know what's being rehearsed to us
[39:46] the promises of what God was what God
[39:49] did that same God is the same God
[39:52] tonight
[39:53] we cannot and the rapture itself will
[39:55] never take place with the minimizing of
[39:58] God's power in any way it must be the
[40:02] same power that was originally delivered
[40:05] to the church on the day of Pentecost
[40:08] and that same power returning in the
[40:11] Church of the Living God and living
[40:13] through the lives of the people the
[40:15] Prophet said it welcomes back the Lord
[40:17] Jesus to the earth so here how that
[40:20] Samuel would be moved by the Spirit of
[40:22] God
[40:22] stand still look what he tells him here
[40:25] pardon me stand still that I may reason
[40:28] with you before the Lord of all the
[40:31] righteous acts of the Lord in that
[40:34] beautiful
[40:34] these aren't righteous acts of the Lord
[40:38] which he did to you and to your father's
[40:41] notice in Psalms 23 - he maketh me to
[40:46] lie down in green pastures notice this
[40:51] it's not it's not us doing this he
[40:54] maketh me you know this is the
[40:56] responsibility of our Shepherd to
[40:58] actually settle us and bring us to a
[41:01] place that even has sheep and that we
[41:04] are able to sit down and enjoy the
[41:06] presence of the Lord - where we're not
[41:08] bothered by parasites were not bothered
[41:11] by little schisms and this and that or
[41:13] whatever more the Bible says he maketh
[41:15] me to lie down in green pastures he
[41:18] leadeth me beside the still waters
[41:22] why do you need steel waters so you can
[41:25] see yourself you need to be able to see
[41:28] yourself so he will lead us beside the
[41:31] still waters there's times for troubled
[41:33] waters and there's times for steal
[41:35] waters is that right there's times for
[41:38] preaching and there's times for teaching
[41:40] now think of this here in Psalms 46:10
[41:47] be still and know that I'm God this is
[41:52] settled - to be settled in him and know
[41:55] that I'm God I will be exalted among the
[41:58] heathen I will be exalted in the earth
[41:59] the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of
[42:02] Jacob is our refuge sail on in numbers
[42:05] 1330 here you find Caleb and Caleb the
[42:09] Bible says remember when the reports had
[42:12] come back from those who had went over
[42:13] in the land and everything was being
[42:16] said about the land and all these things
[42:18] like this and what does the Bible say
[42:20] right here it says that Caleb's killed
[42:22] the people before Moses I'll tell you
[42:26] Caleb had a presence about his life and
[42:28] it was not about his natural DNA it was
[42:31] Caleb remember the Bible said he had
[42:33] another spirit about him he had wholly
[42:36] followed the Lord it was something the
[42:38] presence of the Lord was about his life
[42:41] to where he was actually able to steal
[42:43] the people now I don't know what kind of
[42:45] vernacular he used I don't know if he
[42:47] said shut up be quiet stop talking hey
[42:50] listen what you have to say doesn't
[42:51] matter it doesn't mean anything because
[42:53] why you're talking against what God has
[42:57] said so to think of this here brother
[43:01] bran tells us here he says this is a
[43:04] nervous age that we're in now think of
[43:08] it it's a nervous age you know brother
[43:10] BAM in this message here of stand still
[43:12] brother BAM talks about how he says
[43:15] within the country now this is back in
[43:17] 1957 and I think I heard him just say
[43:19] something here in 1954 as well he says
[43:22] you know across the country he said
[43:24] they've actually identified there's 80
[43:27] some percent that's identified with
[43:30] mental problems now think about it that
[43:32] was back then in 1957 now when you look
[43:35] at it here he says it's a nervous age
[43:38] and he says and what ear said it's that
[43:40] when I give this solemn warning notice I
[43:43] give this solemn warning to the church
[43:45] stand still God always commands to stand
[43:50] still before he does anything the
[43:53] churches is in a neurotic condition
[43:55] they're proselyting puling fussing
[43:58] stewing but stand still
[44:00] now that's the message now to think
[44:03] about it to stand still is to come back
[44:05] to the word think about it how that
[44:07] Israel they are watching the Egyptians
[44:10] and remember that cried unto the Lord as
[44:12] we read in our text but then as they
[44:14] continued to dwell I want you to watch
[44:16] where it's going watch how they
[44:18] continued to dwell upon the advancement
[44:21] of the horse rider and the horsemen and
[44:24] watch how they were coming after him
[44:25] they begin to get their eyes upon what
[44:29] and who was pursuing them and when they
[44:31] begin to get focused upon that then they
[44:34] turned around and they begin to blame
[44:36] Moses but you see when you look and just
[44:39] let yourself live in a humanistic realm
[44:42] you'll look for excuses that are
[44:44] humanistic excuses but you and I were
[44:47] not built and made to live within a
[44:49] humanistic realm you understand we're
[44:51] not built to be victorious by living in
[44:54] this realm there's no way that we can
[44:56] walk in victory by being confined to
[44:59] this realm but on the other hand you and
[45:01] I are to have the influence of the
[45:04] victory from that of where our eyes are
[45:06] tuned beyond that of the natural and
[45:09] when we can look to the Lord well you
[45:11] don't matter what everything else is all
[45:14] around us we know who is with us and I
[45:17] believe that tonight that if we can have
[45:19] our eyes so focused upon that and you
[45:22] know that Satan's objective is to try to
[45:24] get our eyes off of that he might get
[45:27] your eyes upon all the rumors all the
[45:29] situations and everything that you know
[45:32] is said to come your way and you know
[45:34] how it is around the workplace in
[45:35] whatever more rumors fly like a
[45:37] dime-a-dozen you got all kinds of people
[45:40] that have everything drummed up you said
[45:42] brother samuel what should I do I tell
[45:44] you what if you believe that God gave
[45:46] you that job then I would stand there
[45:48] and say Barry nobody can move me out of
[45:51] here until God tells me that I'm done
[45:53] here because this job wasn't about me it
[45:56] ain't about my skills it's God
[45:59] confirming and keeping his word as
[46:02] Jehovah Jireh he's providing for me for
[46:05] my family for my needs and you can stand
[46:08] right there when all types of breath of
[46:11] Satan comes around your way
[46:13] and you can stand there on the Word of
[46:15] God knowing this is what God has for me
[46:18] now look at this here you know so
[46:21] they've got to come back to the word get
[46:24] away from looking at the enemy you know
[46:26] when you think about it brother man
[46:28] would say it like this he says that when
[46:30] Israel was standing there at the midst
[46:33] of the Red Sea he said God brought him
[46:35] to a place like that he said in there
[46:37] they're their way of looking at it he
[46:40] said there wasn't anything else that
[46:42] could be done but to stand still you see
[46:45] it was God's Way of proving and making
[46:47] himself known as we were saying that
[46:50] last week and probably won't be the last
[46:51] time we say it but how can you know that
[46:55] he's a healer
[46:56] unless you've been healed how can you
[46:58] know he's a deliverer unless you've been
[47:00] delivered you see these are not things
[47:03] that we quote or we recite even for
[47:05] myself when I preach I cannot preach
[47:07] according to what I read I preach
[47:09] according to the experience and you see
[47:11] my experience being found in the world
[47:14] that indeed that Jesus Christ is the
[47:16] same but I can preach according to the
[47:19] experience for who I know him to be now
[47:22] you see if a person only knows him to be
[47:24] puny and weak and he's not as strong as
[47:26] it used to be that's all the experience
[47:29] that they have within their lives so
[47:31] that's all that they can either live or
[47:33] they can either preach but you know I
[47:35] didn't meet anyone who was diminished in
[47:37] power but I met beliving God and I
[47:40] believe I'm talking to people tonight
[47:42] who met by living God who actually bring
[47:45] brought such a deliverance within our
[47:47] life and then he himself who is the
[47:50] promise made himself real to us that as
[47:53] he spoke to us then the anointing of the
[47:55] word now moves upon our life to quicken
[47:58] that seed within us not to look at this
[48:01] here in the scriptures here you find
[48:03] Moses now right after this has been
[48:06] spoken in Exodus 14 verse 15 and the
[48:10] Lord said unto Moses we're for Christ
[48:13] now unto me speak unto the children of
[48:16] Israel that they go forward you know
[48:18] when you listen to brother Branham
[48:19] preached why Christ thou speak and
[48:21] brother man why Christ down to me Moses
[48:24] in there in 63 and then the
[48:26] says on this message he said this
[48:28] morning I'm preaching and I'm preaching
[48:30] it to myself
[48:31] he said I'm preaching on me this morning
[48:34] he said we all need a rebuke and I need
[48:37] one with what he's dealing with is how
[48:39] that God has equipped you and I and
[48:42] house he equips our live he Commission's
[48:45] our life and the Prophet goes through to
[48:47] deal with things that will actually
[48:49] paralyze our faith he talks about living
[48:52] right our dress you know you might look
[48:54] at things and things will they don't
[48:56] matter how a dress it does matter God is
[48:58] concerned with how you and I address and
[49:00] you see how we dress how we present
[49:02] ourselves we do not want to be
[49:04] identified with the world you see when
[49:06] will you come under the pressures and
[49:08] succumb to those things like that you're
[49:10] paralyzing your faith you see friends
[49:12] what it is you want your faith to be
[49:15] free to operate program says when you
[49:18] have it when you can't stand people
[49:20] talking about you or the reproach that
[49:22] you have to bear he said what you are
[49:24] doing you are allowing your faith to be
[49:27] paralyzed but I believe tonight we don't
[49:30] want no perilous paralysing of faith I
[49:32] don't want my faith to be grounded we
[49:35] want our faith to be honed into the word
[49:37] to whatever God has called for you want
[49:40] to be able to stand on that word and
[49:42] know that God is standing behind you now
[49:45] think of this here within the Scriptures
[49:47] speak to the children of Israel that
[49:50] they go forward and he tells Moses but
[49:53] lift up thou of thy rod and stretch out
[49:57] thy hand over the sea and divide it and
[50:00] the children of Israel shall go on dry
[50:03] ground through the midst of the sea he
[50:06] goes on to say I will harden the hearts
[50:10] of the Egyptians and I will get on or
[50:12] upon Pharaoh upon his host is chariots
[50:15] as Horseman's and the Egyptians shall
[50:17] know that I am the Lord when I've got me
[50:21] honor upon Pharaoh his chariots his
[50:24] horsemen and the angel of God it says
[50:27] removed from before and it went by
[50:29] on them and it became a go-between
[50:33] the Egyptians could no longer advance
[50:35] and it was there as darkness to them but
[50:39] it was light to Israel now I want you to
[50:41] remember this and think of this here
[50:43] tonight when God tells Moses to take the
[50:46] rod hold it up and stretch it out across
[50:49] though the waters remember that rod was
[50:52] a judgment rod that rod also represented
[50:55] the name of the Lord and brother Ram
[50:58] brings it to us like this he says that
[51:00] rod itself in Moses hand was that of the
[51:04] deity in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:06] Christ so to think of it that that deity
[51:10] within that name that power that was
[51:12] with him that name think of it now what
[51:14] looked like a regular staff but you know
[51:16] what it was it was the scepter of
[51:18] Almighty God this was a word where God's
[51:22] Word how that God Himself was coming
[51:24] down to bring deliverance to his people
[51:27] now when you look at this here within
[51:29] the scriptures it was a go-between and
[51:32] to think how that brother Graham says it
[51:34] like this
[51:34] he said when God was ready to speak he
[51:38] had to steal the people you know it's
[51:42] hard to say something to somebody if
[51:43] they're talking it's hard to say
[51:46] something even you know right now you
[51:48] may not be talking but inside you might
[51:50] be you know it might seem like they're
[51:51] you've got more freeways going on than
[51:53] Los Angeles does you've got all kinds of
[51:56] things going on and you know
[51:58] frustrations and things and whatever
[52:00] more you you know things trying to
[52:02] figure out it what about this but yet to
[52:04] see within the midst of it brother BAM
[52:06] says you can actually say within your
[52:09] heart Lord I'm gonna stand still I'm
[52:11] gonna believe your word and I'm going to
[52:13] expect to see you to move on the scene
[52:16] now I'll tell you I believe it like this
[52:18] as a personal witness that those words
[52:20] to you and I and they seem like little
[52:22] words but when those words are spoken by
[52:25] faith to believe that he is able to do
[52:28] it you watch him come on the scene and
[52:30] he will do things that you and I would
[52:33] think to be impossible listen God is not
[52:36] too big that he looks at your problem
[52:37] your situation or mine and says it's
[52:40] insignificant that's not how
[52:42] values have been remember every
[52:45] experience within our lives is just a
[52:47] test to trial that God is able to make
[52:50] himself known to us now think about this
[52:56] he had to steal the people blood Ram
[52:58] says one day way down coming out of
[53:00] Egypt before they got there
[53:02] God wanted to show his glory and God can
[53:07] only show his glory when his people
[53:10] stand still and looks for it that's
[53:14] what's the matter today with our church
[53:16] people does not stand still and look for
[53:20] the glory of God it's written in the
[53:23] scripture stand still and see the glory
[53:25] or the salvation of God so to stand
[53:30] still this is this is God's design now
[53:33] notice relevance is coming up to the Red
[53:36] Sea this covenant people who had the
[53:38] promise of God who were standing firm on
[53:41] the promise and it's strange to see that
[53:43] when people take a stand for God it
[53:46] looks like the devil throws everything
[53:49] in their way that he can throw in their
[53:51] way but God makes a way through that way
[53:55] he said some of my greatest experiences
[53:58] I've ever witnessed before God is when I
[54:00] get to a place where I couldn't go over
[54:02] under or around but just stand still God
[54:05] makes a way through it somehow God makes
[54:10] a way through it somehow it's
[54:14] unexplainable we just know God made the
[54:17] way notice he hasn't failed yet he never
[54:20] will fail God cannot fail the Brethren
[54:24] says it seemed like when the children of
[54:26] Israel had got up to this Red Sea the
[54:28] pillar fire leading him Pharaoh's army
[54:30] behind him the mountains and the sea
[54:32] cutting them all if all nature would
[54:34] have wept out for this little people
[54:36] unarmed in a great marching army but
[54:39] sometimes God's paths leads right
[54:42] through such places this is important
[54:45] God wanted to show his power God loves
[54:50] to display his power he loves to display
[54:58] his power now think of this brother
[55:03] branham you know puts it real simple I
[55:04] don't think I included this particular
[55:06] quote but billabong talks about how that
[55:08] and going it's just continuing on here
[55:10] he talks about how you get little Joseph
[55:12] or or one of the little girls he said of
[55:14] here's you know Rebecca Sarah he'll get
[55:16] him up you know on his lap and he says
[55:18] you know I get to talking to him and and
[55:20] things like that and you know he says
[55:22] then one of them will you know say he
[55:24] said I I start talking to him and and
[55:26] one and will say daddy draw your muscle
[55:29] up daddy
[55:29] oh you got such a big muscle he said now
[55:33] there's not much there but as long as
[55:34] they think that it makes me feel good
[55:37] and he said our heavenly father likes
[55:40] for his children to know that he's got
[55:43] muscles he can do things for them and
[55:47] sometimes I bring a conversation up so
[55:51] it has to lead to that I just love to
[55:54] hear sat notice I bring a conversation
[55:56] up there on my lap and I bring that
[55:58] conversation up to where they tell me
[56:00] daddy make a muscle because it makes me
[56:03] feel good when I do and they say wow
[56:04] daddy you got a big muscle
[56:06] you see God brings things up so that his
[56:10] muscles can be flexed and you and I say
[56:14] why you got a big muscle wow but the Rev
[56:22] saying you know I used to be a pugilist
[56:23] or a boxer I'm getting old and fat and
[56:25] flabby and decrepit now but I still like
[56:27] to think that I'm back like I used to be
[56:30] but there's one thing about God he's the
[56:33] same yesterday today and forever there's
[56:36] no old age with him he's eternal and not
[56:40] only bad but everyone that receives him
[56:43] becomes eternal with God for there's
[56:46] only one eternal light and God has that
[56:48] alone and when we receive God's eternal
[56:51] life we become eternal with God
[56:53] everything that has a beginning has an
[56:56] end and God had no beginning and he has
[56:58] no in he's eternal forever
[57:02] he goes on to tell us how God wanted to
[57:05] display his power and I found how the
[57:08] brother Bram takes this approach and I I
[57:10] won't read all of this part here but I
[57:12] just in listening to this and looking at
[57:15] it I find it the same way has it's
[57:17] written in the scripture to where the
[57:19] focus itself even though it is told to
[57:22] Israel stand still and see the salvation
[57:24] of the Lord but to think about it even
[57:27] the earth itself is a redeemable
[57:29] attribute of Almighty God and the earth
[57:32] itself has helped right here we'll read
[57:35] about it tonight
[57:36] it helped Israel once it's going to help
[57:38] others over in the tribulation you're
[57:40] with me so the earth itself has been a
[57:43] help many times not to think about it he
[57:46] said he had the red seed to stand still
[57:49] and wall itself up and stand at
[57:51] attention
[57:52] he had the Red Sea glory it obeyed
[57:57] creation obeyed its creator now brother
[58:00] Graham was talking about how he says he
[58:02] will loves you know in that latter
[58:04] paragraph there
[58:05] he said if his people would only listen
[58:07] to him stand still to see his promise
[58:09] he'd like to display that same thing to
[58:12] them today to deliver his people from
[58:15] their bondage of sin and doubt and
[58:17] frustration and sicknesses and every
[58:20] redemptive blessing that Jesus got for
[58:23] belongs to the people it's yours God got
[58:26] the sea to stand steel to watch him do
[58:30] something oh the earth was probably
[58:36] rejoicing and you know because the earth
[58:38] knows what's going to come here in the
[58:39] Millennium very shortly the earth knows
[58:41] what's going to take place in the future
[58:43] home and the earth remember they are
[58:45] waiting groaning for the manifestation
[58:48] of the sons of God the earth no doubt at
[58:50] that time maybe said glory to God maybe
[58:53] this is the moment well maybe this was
[58:56] the time but it wasn't it was just a
[59:00] type of that time Oh mom you know
[59:03] brother Adam he goes on to talk about
[59:05] this and he talks about this I refer to
[59:07] this last week in the message redemption
[59:09] in completeness enjoy what a wonderful
[59:11] message brother Rama goes through that
[59:13] and he deal
[59:14] with how that he said what this was
[59:16] Israel had already come out and there
[59:18] had already been a spiritual death
[59:20] inside of Egypt and they had already
[59:22] been recipients of God's life he said
[59:25] but now you find an enemy that's after
[59:28] God's people he said it was physical
[59:30] death that was gonna try to overtake him
[59:33] and brother Bram said it just like this
[59:34] he says now for example he said how God
[59:37] is going to make a way of escape from
[59:39] physical death where he sent the angel
[59:41] of God between that of the approaching
[59:44] army and that of Israel and brother Ram
[59:46] said it's just like a believer as soon
[59:48] as he gets saved maybe a cancer has
[59:51] eaten him up or some disease God has
[59:54] redemption through power the same as he
[59:58] has redemption for the soul
[1:00:00] he has redemption for the body do you
[1:00:03] realize that this here the divine
[1:00:05] healing is the very earnest of the
[1:00:07] resurrection divine healing itself
[1:00:10] oh my we recognize there is absolutely
[1:00:13] must have that soul must have a divine
[1:00:15] healing but to think about it that when
[1:00:18] sickness and other things that would
[1:00:20] seek to strike our body I'm glad that
[1:00:22] tonight to be able to stand there as a
[1:00:25] witness and there's witnesses around
[1:00:27] this building right here that he is a
[1:00:29] Redeemer of the body it's a witness
[1:00:32] times we got sick and then here we get
[1:00:34] well and then we get sick and then he
[1:00:36] heals us but you know what one of these
[1:00:39] days all of that is a testimony there's
[1:00:41] going to come a final healing one day
[1:00:43] it'll be a change of this mortal body
[1:00:48] glory be to God hallelujah now to think
[1:00:51] of this watch how that this would take
[1:00:54] place in Exodus 15 let's look at this
[1:00:56] here just for a few moments the Bible
[1:00:58] here now when this has taken place and
[1:01:01] what Israel has witnessed what God has
[1:01:05] done and moved on their behalf the Bible
[1:01:07] says in Exodus 15 1 then sang Moses and
[1:01:11] the children of Israel this song unto
[1:01:15] the Lord and they spake singing I will
[1:01:18] sing unto the Lord this there was no
[1:01:21] confusion this was unto the Lord you
[1:01:24] mean God like singing oh yeah the
[1:01:27] Bible says he dwells in the praises of
[1:01:31] his people come on friends I know
[1:01:36] sometimes you know people say well we
[1:01:37] worship different in whatever more but
[1:01:40] you know he dwells in the praises of his
[1:01:42] people he doesn't dwell in the nots he
[1:01:44] dwells in the praises I mean to me it's
[1:01:47] just something about it that you know
[1:01:49] you're actually able to render out
[1:01:51] praise for that which is due praise and
[1:01:53] he's worthy of all our praise whether he
[1:01:56] does any thing else for us or not amen
[1:02:04] now think I will sing unto the Lord oh
[1:02:08] my
[1:02:08] I will sing them to the Lord for he hath
[1:02:12] triumphed gloriously glory be to God oh
[1:02:17] my the horse and his rider has he thrown
[1:02:23] into the sea notice he threw it into the
[1:02:26] sea the Lord is my strength and my song
[1:02:30] and he has become my salvation isn't
[1:02:33] this incredible but this same song is
[1:02:35] also sung over in the Book of
[1:02:37] Revelations and isn't it astounding that
[1:02:40] this is the opening for the chapter of
[1:02:43] the rapture in Psalms 27 the Lord is my
[1:02:47] light the Lord is my salvation
[1:02:50] oh my this has more than just a meaning
[1:02:54] this is a type that's not only building
[1:02:56] faith for the children of Israel but God
[1:02:59] is letting a witness be known that devil
[1:03:02] your end is coming glory be to God let's
[1:03:10] just stay with this tonight though the
[1:03:12] Lord is my strength and song and he has
[1:03:14] become my salvation aren't you glad I'm
[1:03:19] glad he's become my salvation and I'm
[1:03:22] glad he continues to become my salvation
[1:03:24] is that right sometimes when you're down
[1:03:28] he becomes your salvation right when you
[1:03:31] need healing in your body he becomes
[1:03:33] your salvation right and one of these
[1:03:36] days he will become the end of our
[1:03:39] salvation
[1:03:41] glory be to God he has become my
[1:03:45] salvation he is my god and I will
[1:03:49] prepare him in habitation my father's
[1:03:52] God and I will exalt him the Lord is a
[1:03:55] man of war the Lord is his name now
[1:04:04] think about this here let me read a few
[1:04:06] places in the scripture in Psalms 106
[1:04:09] verse 7 I love this
[1:04:11] our fathers understood not by wonders in
[1:04:14] Egypt they remember not the multitude of
[1:04:16] thy mercies
[1:04:17] but provoked him at the Ritz at the sea
[1:04:20] even at the Red Sea and how many tonight
[1:04:23] would say Lord forgive me for not
[1:04:26] remembering when I need to remember but
[1:04:28] help me Lord to remember the multitude
[1:04:31] of thy mercies Lord you're faithful
[1:04:36] you're faithful what brother saying AHA
[1:04:38] I can't remember I know he's done so
[1:04:40] much for you but if you can just let it
[1:04:43] slip away and say Lord you're faithful
[1:04:45] because he is and you'll find God begin
[1:04:48] to bring things back to you and you
[1:04:49] might think why didn't I write that down
[1:04:51] why didn't I remember that but you see
[1:04:53] it was there it's a part of your
[1:04:54] experience but now how that that will be
[1:04:57] brought back to you within that time
[1:04:58] that you can remember the multitude of
[1:05:01] his mercies why is that because our
[1:05:03] tests and our trials are not just
[1:05:06] experiences that are things that we say
[1:05:08] boy I'm glad I got through that no those
[1:05:10] are the molding but chastening the
[1:05:13] discipline the child training and yet at
[1:05:15] the same time through that it's a
[1:05:17] building of our faith it's God preparing
[1:05:20] us for what the next step would be home
[1:05:29] nevertheless oh my nevertheless he saved
[1:05:37] them for his namesake that he might make
[1:05:41] his mighty power to be known he rebuked
[1:05:47] the Red Sea also and it was dried up so
[1:05:50] he led them through the depths as
[1:05:52] through the wilderness and he
[1:05:53] save them look at the scripture he saved
[1:05:55] them from the hand of him that hated
[1:05:59] them and he redeemed them from the hand
[1:06:03] of the enemy those that hated them the
[1:06:08] enemy aren't you glad this is our
[1:06:12] promise it's the same thing for Israel
[1:06:14] you know in the natural God is going to
[1:06:16] redeem Israel come on somebody same way
[1:06:21] that God here is doing that of the
[1:06:23] Gentile church now notice here and the
[1:06:25] waters covered their enemies there was
[1:06:28] not one of them left then believe they
[1:06:30] his words they sang his praise psalms
[1:06:36] 136 this is one of the Paschal Psalms
[1:06:38] one that they sing in the Passover it's
[1:06:40] one of the Hallelujah Psalms Oh give
[1:06:42] thanks unto the Lord for he is good for
[1:06:45] his mercy endures forever to him which
[1:06:48] divided the Red Sea into parts for his
[1:06:52] mercy endureth forever notice to him
[1:06:55] that divided the Red Sea glory be to God
[1:06:58] he opened up this way through the Red
[1:07:01] Sea you know and I think about that you
[1:07:04] realize that within the midst of this
[1:07:06] right here they had come to a place I
[1:07:08] believe it's called I can't remember
[1:07:09] what the pronouncing was reading it you
[1:07:11] know and some of the rabbinical writings
[1:07:12] and things like that
[1:07:13] how that it's called where it leads him
[1:07:14] right down to that place bow is a Roth
[1:07:16] or something to that nature which and
[1:07:18] actually when they had encamped right
[1:07:20] there before the Red Sea the Bible lets
[1:07:23] it be known that's a point where they
[1:07:24] were actually camped there and that very
[1:07:26] name means Lord of the north and it was
[1:07:29] an Egyptian god an idol and to think of
[1:07:32] it that how that God himself would make
[1:07:34] known his power that here they were
[1:07:37] before the God or that of what Egypt
[1:07:39] would look at the Lord of the north
[1:07:41] think about it now think about it who
[1:07:43] said I will ascend unto the sides of the
[1:07:45] north they covered here how the God
[1:07:47] himself would make himself known within
[1:07:50] this time and would show his glory in
[1:07:54] the midst of it oh my eye look at this
[1:07:56] here in the scripture it says he made
[1:07:58] Israel to pass through the midst of it
[1:08:00] for his mercy and do it forever but over
[1:08:03] through
[1:08:05] Haverhill and his host in the Red Sea
[1:08:09] about how to spell when I came across
[1:08:11] this word overthrew well I didn't bout I
[1:08:15] did have a spell and how I've continued
[1:08:16] to have a spell this word overthrew it
[1:08:19] is that word that means is through the
[1:08:23] idea of the rustling of the lion's mane
[1:08:27] which accompanies his roar he overthrew
[1:08:32] Pharaoh by the rustling of the mane
[1:08:35] that's accompanying his roar
[1:08:37] it was the roar of the lion that roared
[1:08:40] in that time and it overthrew payroll it
[1:08:43] overthrew his chariots on my what is
[1:08:46] that lion's roar this is my people these
[1:08:49] are my children I have redeemed them
[1:08:52] this is my purchase and he roars he
[1:09:00] roars and he overthrows him with the
[1:09:03] rustling of his mane go to be to God
[1:09:09] no wonder Nehemiah you see these things
[1:09:11] it's something that is very apart there
[1:09:14] in Israel and I believe a part of our
[1:09:16] life as the people of God you see one of
[1:09:19] the things that's been lost down through
[1:09:20] time I don't have time to deal with the
[1:09:22] tonight but one of the things that's
[1:09:23] been lost down through the ages was the
[1:09:26] very BT of the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:28] Christ was the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:31] Christ and here within the midst of this
[1:09:33] time remember that he saved them for his
[1:09:36] namesake that he might make his mighty
[1:09:38] power to be known in the book of
[1:09:41] Nehemiah chapter not near my referring
[1:09:43] back to this moment he says I believe it
[1:09:46] is in verse 10 he says of how that he
[1:09:48] showed signs and wonders upon Pharaoh
[1:09:50] and all his servants and all the people
[1:09:53] of his land for thou knewest how about
[1:09:55] dealt proudly against them so did us now
[1:09:58] get V a name as it is this day Wow so
[1:10:08] this experience this happening is God
[1:10:11] getting him a name yeah but he already
[1:10:15] had a name
[1:10:17] this he's manifesting his name is that
[1:10:21] right but you see he's never manifested
[1:10:24] this in this way heaven knows of it but
[1:10:30] you see and the angels themselves did
[1:10:32] not know him to be a savior they do not
[1:10:35] know him to be a redeemer they do not
[1:10:37] know him to be a healer
[1:10:38] no wonder David could say in the Psalms
[1:10:42] I believe it some 130 oh how excellent
[1:10:45] is thy name in all the earth he got
[1:10:53] himself a name what's this here in
[1:10:57] Exodus 15 verse 4 he goes on here's this
[1:11:01] singing boy I'll tell you what this was
[1:11:03] a song now this song wasn't in a hymnal
[1:11:07] you with me this song wasn't in the
[1:11:10] hymnal it wasn't anything that they
[1:11:12] could come back out and say hey Moses Oh
[1:11:14] ho-ho
[1:11:15] they'll be singing on these new songs
[1:11:17] now now I'll be singing on there but you
[1:11:21] see this was inspiration that was given
[1:11:24] in this hour you see when you look at it
[1:11:28] you think of songs that are written and
[1:11:30] under the inspiration of Almighty God
[1:11:32] you know you take for example some of
[1:11:34] the songs that are written there have
[1:11:36] been wrote here over the past few years
[1:11:37] and you look within some of those songs
[1:11:39] and it seems like well it don't seem
[1:11:40] like there's any mention sometimes of
[1:11:42] redemption or blood but remember it
[1:11:44] seems like brother Samuel that we're
[1:11:46] singing face to face with God it seems
[1:11:49] like we're there that's called the love
[1:11:50] affair that's called to wear that the
[1:11:52] bride is seeing him face to face and you
[1:11:55] might say well how in the world is that
[1:11:56] taking place that's not even among
[1:11:58] people who are you know writers or or
[1:12:01] bride or whatever mourn yet there are
[1:12:02] some but how would that be remember
[1:12:04] voice of the healing recognizing your
[1:12:06] day and its message brother Ram says
[1:12:08] brother Moore now Jack Moore he said
[1:12:10] brother Moore he said notice them he
[1:12:13] said by being Christians they feel the
[1:12:16] pull of the hour are you with me they
[1:12:21] feel the pull of the hour
[1:12:24] but by not being in luck they don't
[1:12:27] realize what it's all about they're
[1:12:31] asking for send allowed to pray fast but
[1:12:33] you see they don't recognize what it's
[1:12:35] all about but you see much of that
[1:12:37] inspiration though that in itself could
[1:12:39] drop but you see they don't have that
[1:12:41] representation of meaning of what it has
[1:12:44] for you and I because you and I do not
[1:12:46] look at redemption as though that we
[1:12:48] were unworthy this event you and I by
[1:12:51] God's grace in this hour it's restored
[1:12:54] to you and I that we were always saved
[1:12:58] we were always a part of God we were in
[1:13:02] the mind of God we were there when the
[1:13:07] lamb was slain from the foundation of
[1:13:09] the world think about the very
[1:13:12] inspiration that strikes the Prophet
[1:13:14] when brother Graham says the first
[1:13:16] person he said I seen with the baptism
[1:13:18] of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:19] he said that calls me to recognize I
[1:13:21] needed something more he said was that
[1:13:23] black man as he was standing there and
[1:13:25] he was preaching think about the
[1:13:27] scripture brother Brad notice he said
[1:13:29] all the rest him had been preaching
[1:13:31] about what was going on down here on
[1:13:33] earth he said but he dropped back and
[1:13:36] went clear back beyond the horizontal
[1:13:38] rainbow and went clear back there and
[1:13:40] said where were you when the Morningstar
[1:13:43] shouted for joy and the sons of God
[1:13:45] shouted he said where would you see that
[1:13:48] was inspiration within this hour don't
[1:13:51] you realize sometimes that when you
[1:13:52] faint for you and I it's not you that
[1:13:54] has everything or I that have everything
[1:13:57] but how that God is so divinely set the
[1:14:00] body together that there are things that
[1:14:02] you might be praying about you're
[1:14:03] wondering questions or whatever more and
[1:14:05] God not have it maybe it comes out
[1:14:07] through a tape maybe it's there for
[1:14:09] another member of the body maybe it's
[1:14:11] through another ministry and all of a
[1:14:13] sudden that comes you say well why would
[1:14:15] God do that so that we're not depending
[1:14:17] on our own selves because we're doomed
[1:14:19] to fail
[1:14:20] but our dependency is upon the Lord
[1:14:23] Jesus Christ and to think of how that
[1:14:25] God had that place there you said well
[1:14:28] that was part of the prophets message I
[1:14:29] agree
[1:14:30] but there had to be something that would
[1:14:32] strike him to cause him to move in that
[1:14:36] direction exactly where God
[1:14:38] you and I take us back there where we
[1:14:41] were in the mind of God
[1:14:42] you know why you go back there and that
[1:14:44] settling comes in and what we Redemption
[1:14:46] you realize that you can't fail because
[1:14:48] God gained failed in Durst and what that
[1:14:52] does it drives figure out it drive scare
[1:14:55] out all right now notice within this you
[1:14:59] know and I'm so thankful to God you know
[1:15:01] God knows just how to balance the
[1:15:02] Calvinism and Arminianism but I think
[1:15:04] sometimes we get too much if I can look
[1:15:06] at it I think there's still a lot of too
[1:15:08] much of arminianism still we still look
[1:15:11] at a lot of things like what we do I'll
[1:15:13] tell you what its continuing to become
[1:15:14] more and more real how God shows his
[1:15:17] mercy that it is not being you and I
[1:15:19] it's been God's grace I made a choice
[1:15:21] you made a choice that God already made
[1:15:23] his spirit moved upon you to make that
[1:15:26] decision
[1:15:27] think about where did the faith come
[1:15:30] from us come from for us to be able to
[1:15:32] even stand whether it's for healing in
[1:15:34] the service where did that come from
[1:15:35] sovereignly given from a sovereign one
[1:15:40] glory be to God tell you right here in
[1:15:42] the service last week brother Ray was
[1:15:44] sitting right back there he told me the
[1:15:46] testimony after service it's all right
[1:15:47] brother ray he told me the testament to
[1:15:50] service he came back nine I know his
[1:15:52] knee had been bothering me nowhere I
[1:15:53] prayed about I heard him speaker to Paul
[1:15:55] but here that we come into this point in
[1:15:58] time in the service and you know the
[1:15:59] word is just coming forth and how at
[1:16:01] that moment para when the Lord begin to
[1:16:03] speak about standing still he said I had
[1:16:06] a vision of a leg come right here before
[1:16:08] me and he said his leg was so swole up
[1:16:10] than me where he couldn't nearly even
[1:16:11] walk had to kind of swing it around and
[1:16:14] you know putting it up and putting socks
[1:16:15] on and things like that why I know what
[1:16:17] that's life cuz my wife's had to put
[1:16:18] socks on me the fast past few weeks
[1:16:20] because of my back and so I said oh my I
[1:16:23] know I know what you're talking about
[1:16:25] but I didn't know about knee but you
[1:16:26] know what when they come out there after
[1:16:28] that service he said I found myself just
[1:16:30] tapping my foot he said while the song
[1:16:32] service was going on and he said is that
[1:16:34] was going on he said of find myself here
[1:16:36] there's no stompin the foot he said the
[1:16:38] knee itself the swelling was gone
[1:16:40] I can move that me it was something he
[1:16:43] said I just seen it that the leg itself
[1:16:45] placed on the altar of Almighty God
[1:16:48] excu what did that was it brother ain't
[1:16:50] no a sovereign God he dropped the faith
[1:16:54] for that moment same thing he's done for
[1:16:59] many of us thank God for His mercy I
[1:17:03] don't know about you but I love seeing
[1:17:05] God's power I don't want a religion with
[1:17:08] our power I don't want that power if the
[1:17:11] religion remember the Bible the Prophet
[1:17:14] tells us God hates a powerless religion
[1:17:17] aren't you glad not only power to heal
[1:17:20] us it's a power that we live right live
[1:17:24] in holiness live right Oh glory think
[1:17:27] about this here and how then in Exodus
[1:17:30] verse 15 or chapter 15 verse 4 verse 4
[1:17:36] there verse 10 notice here hi I'm boy I
[1:17:39] don't have time to get through this
[1:17:40] adequately but look at this here just
[1:17:44] for a moment he says in verse 4 how he
[1:17:48] says that right hand oh Lord
[1:17:49] he's become glorious and power that
[1:17:52] right hand Oh Lord had dashed in pieces
[1:17:54] the enemy and in the greatness of thine
[1:17:57] excellency thou has overthrown them that
[1:17:59] rose up against thee thou set us forth
[1:18:02] thy wrath which consumed them as stubble
[1:18:05] and with the blast of thy nostrils the
[1:18:08] waters were gathered together fledge
[1:18:10] stood up lad as a heap and the debts
[1:18:12] were congealed in the heart of the sea
[1:18:14] the enemy said I will pursue I will
[1:18:17] overtake I will divide the spoil my lust
[1:18:21] shall be satisfied upon them I will draw
[1:18:24] my sword my hand shall destroy them but
[1:18:28] thou did us blow with I wind and to seek
[1:18:31] cover them they sink as lead in the
[1:18:35] mighty waters well Nehemiah records it
[1:18:42] david records it and another scripture
[1:18:45] at the top part of this one I just read
[1:18:47] the Bible says that they sank into the
[1:18:49] bottom as a stone right here at the very
[1:18:51] part it says that it sank as led in the
[1:18:54] mighty waters in other words there was
[1:18:56] they were not able to overcome the
[1:18:58] waters because the waters
[1:19:01] under the command of the Lord come on
[1:19:05] somebody
[1:19:06] the Red Sea was not for the Egyptians
[1:19:09] but the Red Sea was for us come hold
[1:19:13] somebody hey man this earth it's our
[1:19:16] mother come on now besides remember over
[1:19:20] in the Book of Revelations the dragon
[1:19:22] opened its mouth and spurted out water
[1:19:24] but the earth helped the woman are you
[1:19:28] with me so now when you look at this
[1:19:30] here you find hound that they were slunk
[1:19:33] as a stone sunk has led what's how this
[1:19:35] is recorded now the bible in the
[1:19:38] previous chapter there i'm not going to
[1:19:39] read it but you see when the israel was
[1:19:41] walking into the waters how you know i
[1:19:43] don't want to take you back there do you
[1:19:45] know to Cecil B DeMille but you remember
[1:19:47] how it was when some of you've seen it's
[1:19:49] maybe some of you haven't when the Ten
[1:19:51] Commandments and you know you think
[1:19:52] about how they're walking over and then
[1:19:54] you know God holds this holds that the
[1:19:56] the Egyptians at bay for a certain time
[1:19:58] and then God releases there of the
[1:20:00] Egyptians and they are able to go the
[1:20:03] Bible doesn't tell us here that when the
[1:20:05] Egyptians were released to come after
[1:20:08] Israel but you see God was not going to
[1:20:11] let just a fourth of that army come into
[1:20:14] that water because this army it
[1:20:17] represented Pharaoh's might and his
[1:20:20] power these horsemen and horse riders
[1:20:24] represented here these demon powers that
[1:20:28] had been pursuing the Church of the
[1:20:30] Living God down through the ages come on
[1:20:33] somebody not to think of it here of how
[1:20:36] that in the midst of it when they're
[1:20:38] walking through the waters and no doubt
[1:20:40] they probably begin to maybe hear the
[1:20:42] rumble feel the rumble or they could
[1:20:44] hear them pursuing and to think maybe
[1:20:47] you know some of them said hey let's
[1:20:48] keep moving you know and to think about
[1:20:50] it you know they were able to make it
[1:20:52] upon the bank but I wonder when I look
[1:20:54] how the scripture records it you know to
[1:20:56] where some of them might have been
[1:20:57] looking at it and they're just looking
[1:20:59] one step ahead and they keep on moving
[1:21:02] but you know the Bible says that the
[1:21:04] Lord Himself he looked down through the
[1:21:06] pillar fire through the cloud and he
[1:21:09] troubled the hosts
[1:21:12] Israel didn't know that was taking place
[1:21:14] but you see it was God who was seeing it
[1:21:18] all the way through all Israel had to do
[1:21:21] was walk home they just had to walk home
[1:21:24] they had to follow the word that said
[1:21:27] keep on moving aren't you glad when this
[1:21:31] word has taken a hold in your life
[1:21:33] there's all sorts of skepticism and
[1:21:36] everything else it don't matter how many
[1:21:38] websites blog post you no matter what
[1:21:40] comes your way you're going forward
[1:21:42] there's something about it that's real
[1:21:45] oh my I think like Moses where the Bible
[1:21:49] said Moses refused to be called the son
[1:21:52] of Pharaoh's daughter but he chose
[1:21:54] rather to be called a son of Abraham my
[1:21:58] glory be to God God took off the chariot
[1:22:02] wheels Israel didn't know about that see
[1:22:06] it might be something you're dealing
[1:22:08] with and you don't know that God's
[1:22:10] trouble in the host may be physical
[1:22:13] death is pursuing you may be the hounds
[1:22:17] of hell maybe fence things that's trying
[1:22:19] to come after you and you may not
[1:22:21] realize it but just keep walking because
[1:22:23] God Himself is the one who removed the
[1:22:26] wheels off the chariots the chariots
[1:22:31] represented their power and God took
[1:22:36] those wheels off now remember here Moses
[1:22:39] stretches he's told by God stretch your
[1:22:43] hand over I want you to remember this
[1:22:53] they sink like lead right they sink like
[1:22:56] a stone the Bible says in Exodus 14
[1:22:59] verse 30 and 31 thus the Lord saved
[1:23:04] Israel who's Israel somebody that has
[1:23:10] his name Israel Elf they have his name
[1:23:16] they are prints power with God thus the
[1:23:20] Lord saved Israel that day out of the
[1:23:23] hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the
[1:23:28] Egyptians dead upon the seashore and
[1:23:32] Israel saw the great work which the Lord
[1:23:35] did upon the Egyptians and the people
[1:23:38] feared the Lord believed the Lord and
[1:23:39] his servant Moses they sank his lid when
[1:23:43] as a stone to the bottom burned him up
[1:23:46] like stubble but yet how the scripture
[1:23:49] records it here that Israel saw the
[1:23:52] Egyptian notice here they didn't see him
[1:23:54] the Bible didn't say they saw the mighty
[1:23:56] warriors they saw Egyptians come on
[1:24:00] somebody you know Satan wants to blow
[1:24:03] himself up and try to blow up the things
[1:24:05] members let me tell you something a
[1:24:07] demon is nothing but a fallen angel and
[1:24:10] you remember as you standing there with
[1:24:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost remember
[1:24:17] you have God on your side I hope you're
[1:24:21] with me now there ain't nothing to stand
[1:24:24] or to tremble before a demon you why by
[1:24:26] standing within Christ you've already
[1:24:28] overcome let me tell you something right
[1:24:34] now when you're walking in the pathway
[1:24:37] of the Lord you got to remember whose
[1:24:39] path you're walking in right here you're
[1:24:41] walking in his provided way and God is
[1:24:45] going to take care of this let me tell
[1:24:46] you something there was not enough
[1:24:48] self-help books Israel didn't sit down
[1:24:52] on the seashore and say you know what
[1:24:54] I'm gonna find out how to overcome this
[1:24:55] I'm gonna read read read read read read
[1:24:57] read it's going to take power enough
[1:24:59] psychology you with me it ain't gonna
[1:25:03] take lexicon it's gonna take power it's
[1:25:06] gonna take God's power you see think of
[1:25:11] this here God wanted Israel to see the
[1:25:14] dead Egyptians so God allowed them to
[1:25:17] float up there to the shore you see
[1:25:19] brother Ram tells us like this and
[1:25:21] different places in the message he said
[1:25:23] to think of it what it would be like for
[1:25:24] those Jews how they felt when they could
[1:25:27] look back and see the very thing that
[1:25:28] made
[1:25:29] and whipped him and beat their backs of
[1:25:31] straps and pulled him over was now dead
[1:25:34] floating in the sea he said brother you
[1:25:37] come through the red sea of the blood of
[1:25:40] Jesus Christ in every old dirty habit
[1:25:42] that's drove you to do things that you
[1:25:44] wouldn't do you'll find it Dan in the
[1:25:46] blood of Jesus Christ floating on the
[1:25:48] dead stream believed and goes on to say
[1:25:51] he said Moses looked back and he saw the
[1:25:53] taskmasters drown he said that's a type
[1:25:55] of us coming through the blood of Christ
[1:25:57] cleansing - sanctifying power set aside
[1:26:01] from sin looking back and seeing all the
[1:26:03] smoke and drink and card parties picture
[1:26:05] shows all the lowlife things of the
[1:26:07] world
[1:26:07] dead in the blood of Jesus Christ he
[1:26:10] goes on to say all them old past masters
[1:26:12] that made you do things you didn't want
[1:26:15] to do made you lie and take things and
[1:26:19] cheat and steal and do everything you
[1:26:21] ought to do drink and carry a home and
[1:26:23] go to places you shouldn't you pass
[1:26:25] through the blood of Jesus Christ you'll
[1:26:27] see every one of them dead and back
[1:26:29] there floating in the blood the time
[1:26:33] keeps going on to st. you see them all
[1:26:35] things that drove you to do what you
[1:26:37] didn't want to do but he said what it is
[1:26:38] you're a slave to it but you see the
[1:26:42] blood of Jesus Christ it's the person
[1:26:47] who made the purchase showing his power
[1:26:52] that is taking you not only out of the
[1:26:56] market but you're never to be on the
[1:26:58] slave block again I hope you're with me
[1:27:02] you're never to be on that slave block
[1:27:05] again oh my to think of it here of how
[1:27:09] that Israel and sometimes you would look
[1:27:11] at it I just close with this sometimes
[1:27:13] you look at and you think why do things
[1:27:15] come around my way why is it sometimes
[1:27:17] you know because there's things that you
[1:27:19] can come around your way maybe it is
[1:27:21] some of these things that was named out
[1:27:22] maybe it's things that would be named
[1:27:24] presently within this hour
[1:27:26] maybe it was just some old religious
[1:27:27] church spirit you know where cuz we got
[1:27:29] a lot of that around the message and
[1:27:31] things like that too but you know it
[1:27:32] could just be something like that that
[1:27:34] God took her took Church anity out of
[1:27:36] your life it grew to a place to where
[1:27:38] you said you know what I need to know
[1:27:39] God for myself it's not enough
[1:27:42] to know that this message is the truth I
[1:27:44] don't want to be inducted by that same
[1:27:47] god of the word and it's something how
[1:27:49] he deals with your life and you see how
[1:27:51] that God himself
[1:27:53] we're gonna allow things to encroach and
[1:27:55] come about and try to touch our life but
[1:27:57] notice all of that is witnesses come on
[1:28:00] now it's witnesses that those things are
[1:28:03] dead and you're no longer bound to that
[1:28:09] so sometimes when you experience the
[1:28:12] temptation you say why why would I
[1:28:16] experience the temptation because God
[1:28:19] would allow and permit it and Satan is
[1:28:22] there to try to move but God will allow
[1:28:26] it to remind no longer a slave no longer
[1:28:31] asleep and he'll let you see it on the
[1:28:34] seashore of your life as a witness yes
[1:28:38] indeed I am for you now you're free but
[1:28:42] God lets it be a direct witness to you
[1:28:45] that you can see what he Cink has led
[1:28:48] you can see what he burnt up a stubble
[1:28:50] you can see what he dropped in the sea
[1:28:54] as a stone aren't you glad I'm so
[1:29:00] thankful to the whole mighty God what a
[1:29:03] reason Moses had to sing in the spirit
[1:29:07] what a reason Miriam had of echoing it
[1:29:11] they saw something to rejoice about come
[1:29:16] on friends they saw something to rejoice
[1:29:18] about
[1:29:21] you know I brother Branham called him
[1:29:24] Pentecostals he called him holy rollers
[1:29:29] he called him where others would look at
[1:29:32] him and call him fanatics now no doubt
[1:29:35] they had people in that hour that knew
[1:29:37] how to search out Pentecost Pentecostal
[1:29:40] and search that out in the query and
[1:29:42] pull it up and try to make every little
[1:29:45] bit of display of joy in the camp of
[1:29:48] Almighty God as though it's some kind of
[1:29:50] work up I'll tell you what people got
[1:29:53] problems that do that
[1:29:55] you got problems you're missing the joy
[1:29:57] of the Lord you're missing the joy of
[1:30:00] the Lord o brother Samuel everything is
[1:30:04] not perfect I know including you but
[1:30:08] there is one who is perfect there is one
[1:30:12] who is working in our midst there is one
[1:30:16] who is cleaning up lives there is one
[1:30:19] who is changing us there is one who is
[1:30:22] dismantling holds upon lives there is
[1:30:26] one in our midst who is still healing
[1:30:28] the sick healing the sick in the body
[1:30:30] healing the sick and the soul there
[1:30:32] still is a living God among us
[1:30:36] displaying his power making his name to
[1:30:41] be known her glory you know let's just
[1:30:51] stop here let's just stop
[1:30:56] don't you love him oh my to think of it
[1:31:02] but the RAM says that like this he said
[1:31:04] you know when he came into Simon's house
[1:31:09] he said all the rest of them when that
[1:31:12] woman came in they started whispering oh
[1:31:16] oh you know she's gonna mess up his
[1:31:22] reputation brother Ram said hold it all
[1:31:26] sinners don't mess up Jesus reputation
[1:31:29] his reputation is made where he takes
[1:31:34] sinners and changes him aren't you glad
[1:31:40] you see his reputation in your life it's
[1:31:44] the same he's the same yesterday today
[1:31:47] and forever
[1:31:49] it's a reputation his name it has a
[1:31:53] reputation and in our lives by His
[1:31:56] amazing grace his power is made known
[1:31:59] for his namesake
[1:32:01] that I'm still the
[1:32:03] saying aren't you glad oh ma let's just
[1:32:08] stop here tonight don't you love you
[1:32:11] don't you appreciate these journeys that
[1:32:13] the Holy Spirit just take us on little
[1:32:16] things that he just opens up oh ma tell
[1:32:18] you just means so much to me to show him
[1:32:21] that how these things that God would
[1:32:23] polish up show us these little nuggets
[1:32:25] because you know this is part of our
[1:32:26] journey this right here that we're
[1:32:30] looking at it's not just something that
[1:32:31] was just some type of something that
[1:32:34] took place and it's passed on but God
[1:32:36] was laying it down not only as a type of
[1:32:38] sanctification that God was also laying
[1:32:41] this down as a type of the baptism of
[1:32:44] the Holy Ghost
[1:32:45] he was laying it down that's the words
[1:32:47] of the Prophet he also laid this down as
[1:32:49] a type of that sea of glass of when one
[1:32:54] day we will stand on the other side and
[1:32:57] we will sing and rejoice and we will
[1:33:03] sing the song of Moses he hath triumphed
[1:33:08] gloriously let's just stop here tonight
[1:33:13] let's pray Lord Jesus fathers we bow our
[1:33:20] hearts in your presence how thankful we
[1:33:23] are in this hour Lord that you would
[1:33:28] make known your glorious name Lord when
[1:33:34] we think of this Lord the name of the
[1:33:38] Lord Jesus Christ oh my lord it's
[1:33:41] something that sweeps over our soul Lord
[1:33:45] it's something Lord that just resonates
[1:33:49] within our hearts it's not just
[1:33:51] something Lord there's many who can
[1:33:53] receive tears and other things and that
[1:33:56] Lord we don't despise any of that or
[1:33:58] knocking that no matter Lord coz we know
[1:34:00] that people can only come to a place
[1:34:01] that you've allotted them to come to but
[1:34:04] when we think of it Lord God we not only
[1:34:07] think lord god of you paying the price
[1:34:10] for us the lord we're thankful dear God
[1:34:15] to where the word is preached in power
[1:34:18] and demonstration to where the name of
[1:34:21] Jesus Christ is preached and believed
[1:34:25] just as it was in the early church Nord
[1:34:31] God that the name of the Lord is a
[1:34:33] strong tower that father to see that
[1:34:37] were identified in the name of the Lord
[1:34:41] Jesus Christ by that quickening power by
[1:34:44] your life Lord moving upon our life Oh
[1:34:47] God
[1:34:48] it's not just something we talk about
[1:34:51] it's not just something of a memory that
[1:34:54] we look back 2,000 years ago but we
[1:34:57] recognize the Lord God that we are the
[1:35:01] very reason we are part of that Lord and
[1:35:05] that's your power the deity of the name
[1:35:09] of Jesus Christ that same power and
[1:35:11] authority has moved in our life same
[1:35:17] reputation that it was among our
[1:35:21] brothers and sisters down through the
[1:35:23] ages Lord God we say that by your grace
[1:35:31] not that we merited it no no we could
[1:35:34] never do that
[1:35:36] Israel did not merit you opening the red
[1:35:40] scene you wanted to display your power
[1:35:45] father out pray here this evening

[1:36:40] Heavenly Father that you would make your
[1:36:43] power known in their life maybe they

[1:37:08] we're gonna I don't have to ask for the
[1:37:11] angel God to go between that sickness

[1:37:17] the Lord God father you would make your
[1:37:21] power known in their life Lord I'll
[1:37:25] think of it here over the past year
[1:37:27] actually over the past couple of years
[1:37:28] but when I think just within this past
[1:37:31] year how you've made your power known
[1:37:33] Lord how many different needs that you
[1:37:36] feel that are outright miracles things
[1:37:41] that Lord God doctors could not touch
[1:37:45] father you did not do that to give us a
[1:37:49] great name
[1:37:50] no that's you making your name known
[1:37:54] that's you Lord God letting us know that
[1:37:59] father when we can look and we can see
[1:38:02] it stimulates it stirs our faith Lord
[1:38:07] something about it or gone to what David
[1:38:09] said Lord I long to see what you're
[1:38:12] doing in the sanctuary I long to see it
[1:38:14] out here if we could paraphrase it I
[1:38:16] long to see it out here in my everyday
[1:38:19] life
[1:38:20] Lord God I want to say thank you Lord
[1:38:28] right here as a congregation Lord we
[1:38:32] want to say thank you Lord Jesus father
[1:38:35] how that you have moved Lord so many
[1:38:39] different needs or God that you've moved
[1:38:42] on Lord God
[1:38:44] father experiences Lord I realize that
[1:38:49] these things can be encouragement even
[1:38:52] from one assembly to another but I
[1:38:56] realize Lord that it's encouragement
[1:38:59] it's what Lord that you would do to
[1:39:01] encourage a sword to show and make known
[1:39:04] your power your great name Lord
[1:39:08] that our faith would be built father
[1:39:14] we thank you for that but dear God truly
[1:39:19] signs and wonders accompany the believer
[1:39:23] and we believe that Lord God we are
[1:39:27] believers sword you said in my name they
[1:39:31] shall cast out devils they shall lay
[1:39:34] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:39:37] this is your word it's the Great
[1:39:40] Commission it's given to the Church of
[1:39:43] the Living God Lord Jesus I pray tonight

[1:39:51] one that's discouraged in their walk
[1:39:53] maybe they're down Lord I pray Lord God
[1:39:57] tonight

[1:40:02] reasoning and said you know what this

[1:40:08] it to the Lord that's it look to the
[1:40:12] Lord come back to him stand still and

[1:40:25] it to past what he started he will
