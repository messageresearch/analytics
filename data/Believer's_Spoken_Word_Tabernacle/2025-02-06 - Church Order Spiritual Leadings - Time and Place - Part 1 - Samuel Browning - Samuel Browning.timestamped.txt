[31:15] that was taking place um I was in here
[31:19] praying and I hear sirens all the time
[31:21] so you know you don't think nothing
[31:22] about it and I thought what's going on
[31:25] that I heard that you know how you hear
[31:26] brakes go off on a truck
[31:28] and I heard it right outside the door I
[31:29] thought what in the world's going on you

[31:34] in here with a semi I was going out
[31:35] after him you know but I went out the
[31:38] door and uh and I looked and I thought
[31:40] oh my goodness a firet truck you know
[31:41] it's kind of like a shock because I
[31:43] don't know for you but I've not really
[31:45] been near a fire that where a house has
[31:47] been it's been something you drive by
[31:49] and see it but and I seen it over there
[31:53] and they I just you know to me like I
[31:56] mentioned on the text I was so thankful
[31:58] that um Gus's daughter was there I went
[32:01] over um after everything got uh settled
[32:05] and even Crossing during that time right
[32:07] there I got stopped by the fireman hey
[32:09] who who are you you know we got to watch
[32:11] who's on here and uh so I went over and
[32:14] I wanted to I wanted to speak with them
[32:16] and I got a chance to to talk with Gus
[32:19] and I told him I said Gus I said as soon
[32:21] as I seen that I said I seen I sent out
[32:23] text and the church has been praying
[32:25] said well did you do that I said yeah we
[32:27] we've been praying and Gus is such a
[32:29] nice they they th those those people
[32:32] over there Gus and Donna they've been so
[32:34] good to us and you know Gus has told me
[32:36] at different times he said we watch this
[32:38] we watch this parking lot when you're
[32:39] not
[32:43] here he definitely packs heat I'll tell
[32:46] you that you know he told me some things
[32:49] before when he was watching out here one
[32:50] night and he said early in the we hours
[32:52] in the morning I thought who's out there
[32:53] he said so I went and knocked on the
[32:54] door he said but I had something with me
[32:56] you know so but uh he just you know we
[33:00] we just so want to remember them at
[33:03] prayer and they um I've seen his truck
[33:06] over there but I don't know if there if
[33:07] he's even back in there it was I sent
[33:09] you pictures I tried to do those things
[33:11] just so that you would know as you're
[33:13] praying and it got to a place when
[33:15] everything was first going you couldn't
[33:16] even see I couldn't even really see past
[33:20] the first row like my car was right
[33:21] there I could barely see my car parked
[33:23] by the it was just smoke was just
[33:25] rolling out of there and so it was
[33:27] something with the chimney when I asked
[33:28] him and um so thankfully his daughter
[33:31] was there and uh then you know she was
[33:34] was speaking about that you know and of
[33:36] course her dad which didn't surprise me
[33:38] about Gus but Gus just thought I'll just
[33:40] put it out myself so he tried to with an
[33:43] extinguisher but it it it it came right
[33:46] back and so my heart just went to them
[33:48] and I stood there and talked with Gus
[33:50] and just spent time with him over there
[33:52] um yesterday evening and then came back
[33:54] into the office here and um so let's
[33:57] just remember them in prayer and I told
[33:59] him I said hey anything we can do you
[34:01] let us know and um I want to I heard
[34:04] many prayer requests were mentioned
[34:06] tonight and I want I want to ask you to
[34:09] continue remember brother Homer and
[34:10] Loria in prayer uh brother Homer it was
[34:13] at the end of last week when he he sent
[34:15] me a text and uh asked me to pray
[34:17] because they just had uh diagn or um how
[34:22] do you say it diagnosed with covid and
[34:24] so he just I asked him how you doing he
[34:26] said it's pretty rough and but uh the
[34:28] Lord has certainly been merciful and we
[34:30] just been holding him up in prayer he
[34:31] said just got just got a little bit of a
[34:33] cough right now but he's doing better so
[34:36] and uh I just said Lord Brother you
[34:38] can't take brother
[34:40] Homer that's my
[34:42] buddy uh but uh brother Homer just means
[34:45] so much to me he's been such a such a
[34:47] blessing and um so I also want to
[34:50] remember I don't know if this prayer
[34:51] request came because sometimes I have
[34:53] problems hearing sister remember sister
[34:55] Sharon Van van white do I got that right
[34:58] brother Paul leontine sister she they
[35:01] they've had a reoccurrence of the cancer
[35:04] and so she was just going into radiation
[35:06] that uh reoccurrence uh was noted at the
[35:10] end of December and so
[35:13] um they're uh doing going back in for
[35:16] radiation here I think beginning
[35:18] tomorrow or one of these oncoming days
[35:20] so let's just continue to you know keep
[35:22] her in prayer and uh she's sister
[35:24] Sharon's doing very well it was
[35:26] mentioned here about sister Cheryl Lewis
[35:28] too and so uh was there to see her the
[35:31] other day and to pray with her and uh
[35:33] and she really got a double whammy of
[35:35] the pancreitis and then the gallbladder
[35:37] with gall stones and so they went in to
[35:39] take the gall stones out today
[35:41] and they they couldn't so she they're
[35:45] looking at doing that I guess possibly
[35:48] because everything was there's so much
[35:49] inflammation so um they're looking at
[35:52] doing that in one of the upcoming days
[35:53] so just continue to keep Sister Sarah in
[35:56] your prayers and and um that the Lord
[35:58] will just you know just move for her and
[36:02] uh and I think that's pretty much just
[36:04] about it brother Dave Junior had sent me
[36:06] a text right before when I was getting
[36:08] in the in the office uh early today and
[36:12] and he uh his back is doing so much
[36:15] better and they've had some transition
[36:18] things at work going on and uh so he
[36:20] just texts me said I I just he had to go
[36:23] back in early tonight so he just asked
[36:25] us to remember in prayer and I ask you
[36:26] not only for the healing his body but
[36:28] just that God will just give him
[36:30] guidance and wisdom because I don't know
[36:32] if it's it seems like it's a new
[36:33] position and it's some things that you
[36:35] weren't planning on it just happens and
[36:38] um so just keep him in prayer and once
[36:41] again it's so good to see you and um we
[36:44] just uh this where my heart is at this
[36:48] that's where my heart's at and uh so I
[36:52] got to see you this is good man now we
[36:55] can just say take the name of Jesus with
[36:56] you and let's go home
[37:00] but um we want to look into the word of
[37:02] the Lord tonight and U just ask the Lord
[37:05] to come in a special way if you'd like
[37:07] to stand with
[37:12] me I want to go to 1 Corinthians
[37:18] 14 1 Corinthians
[37:21] 14 and verse uh 26 is where I want to
[37:25] begin here this evening
[37:29] pardon
[37:36] me so it says how is it then
[37:40] Brethren when you come together every
[37:43] one of you half a Psalm half a Doctrine
[37:46] half a tongue half a revelation half an
[37:51] interpretation let all things be
[37:54] done unto edifying
[37:58] and the key is edifying
[38:01] who the whole thing that everything that
[38:04] is to be done it's the edifying to the
[38:11] body If any man speak in an unknown
[38:13] tongue Let It Be by two or at the most
[38:19] by three and that by course so notice
[38:23] how Paul writes this here giving this
[38:26] direction
[38:28] that the most within when there's a
[38:30] gathering that that comes among the
[38:33] people the most is two or two or three
[38:37] at the most and that by course so that
[38:39] you don't have everyone going at the
[38:41] same
[38:42] time there's the tongues and then the
[38:46] interpretation is the prophecy so what
[38:49] if what if there's a fourth person that
[38:52] says I've got something on my heart I
[38:55] know it's coming can't do
[38:58] it hold
[39:01] it that's the scriptural order that's
[39:05] good so even if it's felt yeah even if
[39:08] it's
[39:09] felt but if they're and let and let one
[39:12] interpret but if there be no
[39:15] interpreter let him keep silent in the
[39:17] church and let him speak to himself and
[39:21] to God let the prophets speak two or
[39:24] three and let the other judge so now now
[39:27] Paul brings this in on the judge on this
[39:30] is supposed to be
[39:32] judged if anything be revealed to
[39:34] another that Seth by let the first hold
[39:37] his peace for ye may all prophesy one by
[39:40] one that all may learn and all may be
[39:46] comforted so this notice how Paul is
[39:48] dealing with this this isn't someone
[39:52] satisfying their
[39:55] self as though they must or have to do
[39:58] something and if they don't within a
[40:01] service I failed that's good you let me
[40:06] just say this to you I could I could
[40:08] read a quote to you out of this multiple
[40:10] quotes there will be many many people
[40:14] that will walk down the streets of gold
[40:17] that will never speak in
[40:21] tongues but said they'll never work
[40:23] miracles that is real good going all the
[40:26] way down through he said but their life
[40:29] is a
[40:30] display of the glory of God so I I ask
[40:33] you what's the greater Miracle that's
[40:36] right do we need the gifts we do but the
[40:39] gifts themselves are no
[40:42] Vindication of God's presence Among Us
[40:47] is so good we need the gifts don't we
[40:50] brother bam tells us we have five
[40:51] ministerial gifts brother BR said this
[40:54] is the those are four if we read the
[40:56] scriptures and we don't we can't
[40:58] understand that God has five ministerial
[40:59] gifts and he said if we still can't get
[41:02] it God has nine spiritual gifts now true
[41:08] we can pull out of the scripture and say
[41:10] well one prophesy one Speaking tongues
[41:12] and one prophesy and it come to pass
[41:14] surely God is with you but remember that
[41:18] is only as
[41:21] needed are you hearing me it's as needed
[41:25] so we it's not necessary for us to have
[41:28] that in order to say we've had church
[41:32] tonight no more than anything else
[41:34] that's right is that right that's that's
[41:37] that's what Paul is bringing us to I'm
[41:39] so glad about that aren't you I'm glad
[41:41] that the message of the hour goes in it
[41:43] bring everything is rest rest rest
[41:46] notice and the spirit of the prophets
[41:49] are subject to the prophets for God is
[41:53] not the author of confusion but of peace
[41:57] as in all churches of the Saints may God
[42:01] bless you and bless the reading of the
[42:02] word as you're being
[42:06] seated I'm sorry I didn't even move that
[42:09] along when I was
[42:12] reading let's go to on down there in
[42:16] verse
[42:18] 36 Paul said what came the word of God
[42:21] out from you or came it unto you only if
[42:25] any man think himself to be be a prophet
[42:28] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[42:31] the things that I write unto you are the
[42:35] Commandments of the Lord but if any man
[42:39] be ignorant let him be ignorant so
[42:42] Paul's just said this we're not going to
[42:44] argue if a man chooses to be ignorant
[42:48] and not heed to the leadership of the
[42:50] word that's on him I don't want to be
[42:54] ignorant that's I want to be taught by
[42:56] the Holy Spirit
[42:58] wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and
[43:02] forbid not to speak with tongues let all
[43:06] things be done decently and in
[43:10] order now I'm going to just step in here
[43:14] tonight and uh I'm not on job but I
[43:18] actually looked at a lot of these things
[43:20] and I've studied on these things for
[43:21] about the past two to three years
[43:24] almost and really just looking over over
[43:27] them and going back through and I know
[43:29] I've dealt with these things at
[43:31] different times I think one of the last
[43:32] times I had to CH search down in
[43:35] outlines I think it was back in 2006
[43:37] that's a long time ago but I've hit it
[43:39] here and there and looked at things and
[43:41] things that I look at that uh that I see
[43:44] there's things that I can I watch and I
[43:47] observe meetings and other things too
[43:49] and I watch what takes place and I'll
[43:52] just be honest with you I'm not here I
[43:54] do not take it upon myself I'm not here
[43:56] and responsible for any other
[43:59] congregation but right
[44:01] here but however any other congregation
[44:04] chooses to do that's what they choose to
[44:06] do but the very thing that was so
[44:09] burdened upon my heart that when looking
[44:12] at this and that is I want to deal with
[44:15] within Church order and deal with this
[44:17] very Point spiritual leadings time and
[44:22] place I find one of the things that over
[44:24] the course of time that that I have
[44:27] pastored and it certainly is very
[44:29] peanuts compared to Brothers like
[44:31] brother Homer and things like that that
[44:33] probably is listening right now it's
[44:35] very small it's only been 22 almost 23
[44:38] years but the one thing that I have
[44:40] found and I you try to work for in
[44:43] everything that you do is to try to
[44:46] alleviate so that the people of God
[44:49] operate under rest so that there there's
[44:52] a rest within them they're not feeling
[44:55] pressure um they're not feeling some
[44:58] some sort of a guilt or something but I
[45:00] realize that there's things that many
[45:02] times that whether it's been in it's
[45:04] been taught or it's just our conception
[45:07] of how things are it can become so
[45:10] lodged in that gate of the conscience in
[45:13] the spirit just let me give you an
[45:15] example it can things can become to such
[45:17] a place to where that individuals can
[45:20] actually feel if they're not coming to
[45:22] an altar every
[45:25] service some something's
[45:28] wrong I've had them get up right behind
[45:30] me after ministering in a meeting and
[45:33] when the spirit of God is speaking
[45:35] personally to individual hearts and a
[45:37] person would come right up behind me and
[45:39] I had no idea that this was done but
[45:42] actually called everybody to The
[45:45] Altar and you can imagine the altar was
[45:47] already enough of individuals filled to
[45:50] pray with that had already been
[45:53] convicted but then to have someone else
[45:55] come behind that and say I think
[45:57] everybody needs to come to the altar we
[45:59] all can come well I'm not against coming
[46:01] to the altar but I'm also want that that
[46:04] comes to the altar it comes under the
[46:06] conviction that the word has brought to
[46:08] their hearts that's that's good so
[46:12] there's ways and when we approach things
[46:14] on spiritual leadings and things to
[46:16] where that many times that sometimes
[46:19] when I've noticed it over the time to
[46:21] where that sometimes a person can feel
[46:23] like in some ways if they don't do
[46:25] certain things that they're displeasing
[46:27] the Lord and they just it it it just so
[46:30] it just so wears on them and yet
[46:32] everything that God will ever lay upon
[46:35] our heart to do God will always make a
[46:38] way and it will always operate according
[46:40] to the word and there's things that can
[46:43] be genuine leadings but it still falls
[46:47] into our discretion on when we yield for
[46:52] that to come to pass and that's what I'm
[46:55] going to work with here tonight on
[46:56] spiritual leadings because when we look
[46:59] at when we look at statements the
[47:01] prophet makes in the church age book of
[47:03] how that the the congregation is not to
[47:06] be operated by program but it's to be
[47:08] under spontaneous worship but
[47:10] spontaneous worship does not mean just
[47:14] free for all spontaneous worship does
[47:17] not mean I do as I feel to
[47:20] do that does not mean that way when
[47:22] brother Bram goes on to say in the
[47:23] Ephesian Church age that that that the
[47:25] camp of God is is under the pillar of
[47:28] fire is to be dominated by the Holy
[47:30] Ghost to where that all have a part in
[47:34] participating in the service it it we
[47:37] understand the Liberty that we have but
[47:39] if we go back and look close enough
[47:42] there was a divine order that God had
[47:44] set forth for the children of Israel
[47:48] they just couldn't run into the
[47:49] Tabernacle they couldn't even even they
[47:52] could not just come into certain places
[47:54] at certain at any time they wanted it
[47:56] was at certain designated times and in a
[48:00] certain designated way even when they
[48:03] camped around the Tabernacle they could
[48:06] not decide well you know I'd rather be
[48:08] on the west side instead of the East
[48:10] Side I'd rather be on the south instead
[48:11] of the north you say did that matter it
[48:13] absolutely mattered God had their
[48:15] standard placed in a certain way God is
[48:18] a god of order and sometimes that that
[48:21] seems to be uh a clash with the word of
[48:25] God but it's not the word of God is
[48:28] orderly it's not man's order when man
[48:31] gets a hold of it it's a mess but when
[48:33] God God is a god of order even when we
[48:36] we look at and think of the planets the
[48:38] solar system and everything else God so
[48:40] set those things in a place of divine
[48:43] order Now watch how brother Ram says
[48:44] this here he says put those things in
[48:46] their places he's talking about the
[48:48] gifts put all your gifts in there your
[48:50] teachers your Apostles put everything in
[48:53] its place and then operate in decent and
[48:57] in order you'll find God is a god of
[49:00] order I love that you'll find how many
[49:02] have found that that that order is not
[49:05] taking away from God order is not or
[49:08] order is quenching the spirit order does
[49:10] not a true order by God does not quench
[49:13] the spirit it is a channel for the
[49:16] spirit to be displayed correctly that is
[49:19] so good so you'll find God is a god of
[49:23] order and he will bring the thing right
[49:26] up there them so order is Godly and it's
[49:29] also Divine now look here in some
[49:32] scriptures you'll find this mentioned a
[49:33] lot in Paul's writings and especially
[49:36] here in the Corinthian Church Paul
[49:38] dealing with this you know coming out of
[49:39] out of that of communion when there was
[49:41] some things that had to be corrected he
[49:43] says if any man hunger let him eat at
[49:45] home that ye come not together unto
[49:47] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[49:51] order when I come in 1 Corinthians 14:40
[49:55] which we read this let let all things be
[49:57] done decently and in order that very
[50:02] thing right there with the scripture
[50:03] just become it's a principle we can
[50:05] apply to all of our lives that very
[50:08] scripture right there is a scripture and
[50:10] it's just like when I can tell them you
[50:12] know in things when it comes to
[50:13] courtship brother Shane you know this
[50:14] this is the very scripture I said if
[50:16] you'll just run everything through that
[50:18] scripture you'll be all right you won't
[50:20] have to have a whole list of rules of
[50:22] dos and don'ts but if you'll run
[50:24] everything right through that scripture
[50:26] you'll be all right this is very very
[50:29] powerful let all things be done decently
[50:31] and in order now does that mean that I
[50:33] don't believe we need teaching on things
[50:35] like courtship and this things like that
[50:37] sure but you understand what I'm saying
[50:39] in 1 Corinthians 16:1 now concerning the
[50:43] collection for the saints were the
[50:45] offering that would be lifted as I have
[50:47] given order to the churches of galatia
[50:50] even so do ye in Colossians 2:5 for
[50:53] though I be absent in the flesh yet I am
[50:56] with you you in the spirit joying and
[50:58] beholding your order and the
[51:01] steadfastness of your faith in Christ
[51:03] and then he goes on for this call
[51:05] speaking to Titus I have left you in cre
[51:09] cre that thou should us set in order the
[51:12] things that are wanting and ordain
[51:15] Elders in every city as I had appointed
[51:18] thee I'm thankful for
[51:20] order I'm really thankful for it I mean
[51:23] I I look when I go into Banks or
[51:25] sometimes when you go into different
[51:27] I'm thankful there's an order of
[51:28] approach I'm thankful it's not a
[51:30] free-for-all I've been in places where
[51:31] it's a free-for-all and you don't know
[51:33] who's
[51:34] next you can just leave this country and
[51:36] I don't care if it's a stoplight it
[51:38] doesn't matter right yeah first time I
[51:41] went to Honduras I was sick as a dog
[51:43] when I got off the plane and that
[51:44] started driving me around I wasn't used
[51:46] to Horns being the right away like I
[51:50] told Brother Samson and M in Ghana I
[51:51] said in Africa I said in America horns
[51:54] are a novelty they just put them on the
[51:55] car but Africa that's your
[51:58] communication I mean they they scared me
[52:00] to death I mean here they are pulling
[52:01] out in front of you finally you know God
[52:04] gives you Grace to just be able to lock
[52:05] in and you you know you're laughing at
[52:07] me but you know brother Josh way if he
[52:09] was here tonight he was the one that
[52:11] called me when he was back over in Congo
[52:13] where he came from and said I don't know
[52:15] if I can do it I don't know if I can
[52:17] stay here this many more days I said yes
[52:19] you can yes you can you got business to
[52:21] take care of yeah yes you can and I but
[52:23] I told him this is what you do don't
[52:25] watch the road they know what they're
[52:27] doing they they know how to dodge the
[52:29] telephone poles come up on the sidewalk
[52:30] and they they're used to all that just
[52:33] put put your seat or put your face on
[52:35] the back of that seat right there I said
[52:37] trust me I've learned to look at
[52:39] headrest a
[52:42] lot but it's order you know I appreciate
[52:45] order because order gives you Direction
[52:48] order even gives you an expectation it
[52:51] it shows a natural progression with
[52:54] things of things that we can even look
[52:56] forward to now when you think of this
[52:59] it's very much like Elijah in this in in
[53:02] the time in First Kings 17 it was a
[53:04] prophet to set the church in order
[53:06] according to God's Divine program when
[53:08] Elijah got on the mount remember he
[53:10] repaired the altar but he didn't pick up
[53:13] stones or take Stones up there he used
[53:16] what was already there it's just it was
[53:18] scattered and that's the same thing when
[53:20] God sent the prophet in this hour and
[53:22] let me just mind remind you of this
[53:24] right here the prophet of God in this
[53:26] hour is a major prophet it's not an
[53:29] Ephesians 4 Prophet it is the major
[53:32] prophet that Ephesians for comes under
[53:36] true Ministry does and every believer
[53:39] will heed to that word as well too that
[53:41] is one of the evidences of the Holy
[53:44] Spirit In Our Lives now when we look at
[53:47] how that Elijah would put this order
[53:49] together even the wood would be put in
[53:51] order even the sacrifice would be put in
[53:53] order and when God came down like he did
[53:56] on the the Tabernacle Moses had erected
[53:58] Solomon on and on and on and even right
[54:01] there on Mount Carmel God himself was
[54:05] confirming the word he had given to
[54:07] Elijah and when the order had been
[54:10] followed God came to his
[54:13] word and so when we look at this brother
[54:16] Bram tells us in church order in
[54:19] December he says Brethren we've been
[54:21] called this meeting together here
[54:23] tonight for the purpose of knowing how
[54:25] that to operate the Church of the Living
[54:28] God which we believe to be a part of
[54:31] this church now not too long ago about a
[54:33] year ago I heard a brother that would
[54:35] took this very quote right here and and
[54:38] isolated Church order to brandom
[54:42] Tabernacle yeah isolated well this
[54:45] doesn't pertain and just kind of you
[54:47] know poked at different things but this
[54:49] if you notice what was spoken right here
[54:51] and recognize that the prophet of the
[54:53] age you see this is why that when you
[54:56] have men going in and well I think
[54:57] brother Brandon meant this and I think
[54:59] brother BR meant this let me tell you
[55:00] what that is that is not recognizing the
[55:03] ministry of Malachi 4 the son of man
[55:07] Ministry Revelations 10:7 it does not
[55:10] recognize the Divine Authority that God
[55:13] has committed to his seventh angel
[55:16] messenger which has now been placed into
[55:19] the hands and hearts of the Believers so
[55:21] to me I'm not interested in tampering
[55:23] with it you and I were like the people
[55:25] that had the hood up on on the car
[55:27] putting this wire to this wire to this
[55:28] to this to this we did not even know how
[55:31] to make things run we didn't even know
[55:32] how to make our own life operate and
[55:34] live a real Godly life but God himself
[55:37] came down it was not brother brandham
[55:40] but God through that vessel and through
[55:43] that Ministry it was not the second in
[55:45] command it was the chief mechanic that
[55:49] showed up and he showed up if you'll
[55:51] notice how brother Ram tells that he
[55:53] showed up in unlikely apparel
[55:57] suit and tie he did not show up in blue
[56:02] jumpsuit like that of someone working in
[56:04] a garage why he was the chief
[56:06] engineer and when when the young man or
[56:10] listened to what was said to do and it
[56:13] worked he turned around and that's what
[56:15] caused him to ask the question who are
[56:17] you and the man said I'm the one who
[56:19] designed that engine aren't you glad
[56:21] that the one who knows about you and I
[56:23] the one who who wrote who is the word
[56:26] aren't you glad that he's here right
[56:27] among us to give sense to the
[56:31] word oh I thank God for that notice how
[56:35] that you know brother R would would
[56:36] speak of these things in church order
[56:38] and he would he would speak to us and
[56:39] say you know brother and I know he says
[56:41] that you know many of you you kind of
[56:43] you kind of look to me you know as as a
[56:45] there's got to be a final absolute and
[56:46] you kind of look to me in that way my
[56:48] absolute he said is the word and as Paul
[56:51] said you follow me as I follow Christ
[56:55] notice in Philippians 4:9 those things
[56:57] which you have both
[56:59] learned received and heard and seen in
[57:03] me do and the God of Peace shall be with
[57:07] you second th Thessalonians 2:15
[57:10] therefore Brethren Stand Fast and behold
[57:13] the Traditions which have been taught
[57:16] whether by word or Epistles these are
[57:18] the kind of traditions that I don't
[57:21] mind but see sometimes our the word or
[57:25] the verbiage is it's almost looked at
[57:27] well I tell you that the bride's free
[57:29] we're free from within we are free
[57:33] within our nature we have been we have
[57:36] been disassociated not just only
[57:39] divorced there has come a death to that
[57:42] first man and we have been United to the
[57:45] second Adam to the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:48] through him by a spiritual union we are
[57:51] a new creation in Christ Jesus and that
[57:56] being said then there are things that
[57:58] when we look at it our only desire is to
[58:01] acknowledge his word our only desire is
[58:04] to obey his word I believe that's the
[58:08] desire of every one of us as
[58:10] Believers I want to just touch this this
[58:13] uh uh scripture here tonight but I'm not
[58:15] going to read it you can read it at home
[58:17] because I I'll cover it in another
[58:19] service coming up but when Paul writes
[58:21] of this in Romans 12 verse 4 and verse
[58:25] through verse 8 and he is talking about
[58:26] how that we have our bodies have many
[58:28] members and likewise the body of Christ
[58:30] has many members and so forth and how
[58:33] that there are gifts that differ
[58:34] according to the grace of God and
[58:36] prophesy proportion of Faith but let us
[58:39] wait on our
[58:42] ministry and so when we understand that
[58:45] there's a time that even you know when
[58:48] we're looking to the Lord for his
[58:51] leading even as we come together we are
[58:54] waiting upon on on the Lord to guide and
[58:58] direct and minister to us the very
[59:01] things that we have need of just as much
[59:04] as I am trusting in his leadership all
[59:07] the way even through the time that I
[59:09] will stand out here God close my mouth
[59:11] to anything that that you don't you
[59:13] don't wouldn't want me to say and give
[59:15] me and fill my mouth with what you do
[59:18] want me to say well see brother bam is
[59:20] taking this and I'm not going to dwell
[59:22] on this tonight and he all the way
[59:24] through the message this was not a night
[59:26] 1963 thing where brother Bram comes out
[59:28] and specifically says that type of
[59:31] ministry tongues and prophecy should not
[59:34] be done on the main
[59:37] floor
[59:39] oh it's all the way through the
[59:42] message quote after quote after quote
[59:45] but you see these are things remember a
[59:47] prophet of God is coming to put that in
[59:50] order now I know I know remember when
[59:52] brother BR when he actually did that
[59:54] that's what caused Junior Jackson to to
[59:56] leave the church yeah that's right
[59:58] that's what caused Junior Jackson and
[59:59] the rest of them and you know why
[1:00:01] because they were not willing to come in
[1:00:03] subjection to the word of God and then
[1:00:07] like brother Bram said he said that's
[1:00:08] why junior Jackson is having all the
[1:00:10] problems he's
[1:00:11] having
[1:00:13] wow now I don't want to be
[1:00:17] ignorant and I'm saying these things and
[1:00:19] I'm saying I really am I'm saying it you
[1:00:21] from from the depths of my heart there's
[1:00:22] things that I've looked at and you know
[1:00:24] there's a lot of things that God has
[1:00:26] opened my heart and my eyes to over over
[1:00:29] the period of time I there's a lot of
[1:00:32] things and there's things that even that
[1:00:33] I intend to really to revisit here
[1:00:35] tonight and looking at some of these
[1:00:38] things and looking at it but if you can
[1:00:40] understand it this way right here the
[1:00:42] prophet of God the word of God never
[1:00:44] come to take anything from us that God
[1:00:47] has given us in his word that's good
[1:00:50] it's it's here to move in the right
[1:00:53] channel now notice brother Ram will talk
[1:00:56] about this in in church order and you
[1:00:57] know he deals with things cuz you know
[1:00:59] even as we have and I know now we' we've
[1:01:01] got we've got new ones that's come in
[1:01:03] well I mean my goodness since before I
[1:01:05] mean 19 years ago when I took just time
[1:01:07] and I probably it'll be a lot more in
[1:01:09] depth than it was the last time on those
[1:01:12] things but you know when you look at it
[1:01:14] there's times that we all even need
[1:01:16] Refreshers on these things I don't know
[1:01:19] about to you because I don't when I when
[1:01:21] I when I Minister yeah the holy spirit
[1:01:23] will bring things back to me that I've
[1:01:24] studied man he'll bring things back that
[1:01:26] I didn't he wasn't even thinking about
[1:01:28] whatsoever he'll begin to put things
[1:01:29] together but when I go to study
[1:01:31] something like this I don't go back to
[1:01:33] Old outlines I I I want to study I want
[1:01:36] to look back through the same quotes and
[1:01:38] look over things and and also as you'll
[1:01:40] bring things to me because listen I I
[1:01:42] want the Holy Spirit to teach me in his
[1:01:45] word I want God to speak to my heart and
[1:01:48] minister to my life don't you I I mean
[1:01:50] when I display something up there you
[1:01:52] don't want to say oh I know that quote
[1:01:53] already oh I know that scripture already
[1:01:55] I want the Lord to speak to me I I
[1:01:58] because if he's laid it on my heart and
[1:02:00] going through these passages then Lord
[1:02:02] speak to my heart there's something in
[1:02:05] here that we need in our
[1:02:09] lives so brother R goes on and he's
[1:02:11] talking about you know when you have
[1:02:14] someone like a baby starting out he says
[1:02:16] you know they they can have a little bit
[1:02:18] of a difficulty with talking they goooo
[1:02:21] and things like that and you know when
[1:02:24] they're doing that like our our boys
[1:02:25] when they were going through that they
[1:02:28] never we didn't spank them because they
[1:02:32] goooo did y'all do that we didn't do
[1:02:35] that I mean even when they were walking
[1:02:37] learning to walk I never when they fail
[1:02:39] and you know you start putting
[1:02:41] everything around tables you're putting
[1:02:43] pillows I mean the whole thing becomes
[1:02:44] like a you know you almost want to think
[1:02:46] you need but blow up you know blow up
[1:02:48] things all around everywhere you know
[1:02:49] cuz you're oh my goodness there's a
[1:02:50] corner table quick quick every all of a
[1:02:53] sudden every right angle becomes a
[1:02:55] problem
[1:02:56] every corner because all you can see
[1:02:57] from Corners you look at Corners instead
[1:02:59] of saying man that was a beautiful table
[1:03:01] when you're at the furniture shop you
[1:03:02] look at it and say wow what a knot that
[1:03:04] could put on their
[1:03:06] head true you you you you're worried
[1:03:09] about that you see them you know going
[1:03:10] like this and so you don't spank them
[1:03:13] when they fall but you guide them yeah
[1:03:16] and so when brother Braham is going
[1:03:18] through this within the he would even
[1:03:20] speak of these things to where that even
[1:03:22] when you have someone come in maybe
[1:03:25] there new you don't reach up to them
[1:03:28] harshly maybe they they just come in and
[1:03:30] and you know they're they themselves are
[1:03:32] just learning because maybe they weren't
[1:03:34] setting and and being taught and maybe
[1:03:36] they come from a different background
[1:03:37] and brother BR said bring them back to
[1:03:39] this tape take them to the side and just
[1:03:42] talk to them just work with them there a
[1:03:45] little bit just just minister to them
[1:03:47] because you can't you can't correct them
[1:03:48] for anything that they don't already
[1:03:50] know and you know there's a way to
[1:03:51] correct correction is not altogether
[1:03:54] just the belt right that's right the
[1:03:56] Bible deals with us that chastening
[1:03:58] itself is also to with words as well to
[1:04:02] guide now brother B will deal with this
[1:04:05] in this manner and he says you know
[1:04:07] there's always an appropriate time you
[1:04:08] know how you teach and little children
[1:04:09] you we we all had to teach our kids um
[1:04:13] uh we all had to teach our kids CU you
[1:04:15] know they thought everything was it
[1:04:18] needed to be known hey Daddy Daddy Daddy
[1:04:20] and here you are you might I might be in
[1:04:22] the middle of of of having a brother
[1:04:24] over at my house and sister sister and
[1:04:26] man all of a sudden they run in from the
[1:04:27] back door daddy daddy guess what I hit a
[1:04:31] home run it's over the fence the
[1:04:33] neighbor said you got to come and get
[1:04:36] it so it becomes an opportunity to teach
[1:04:41] them that's
[1:04:44] wonderful now Daddy's talking right
[1:04:47] now and then even to further instruct
[1:04:50] that later on because if not they'll
[1:04:52] keep interrupting you the whole life oh
[1:04:54] yeah so you got to set
[1:04:57] boundaries boundaries are healthy
[1:04:59] they're Godly that's that's a different
[1:05:01] subject but to understand you got to
[1:05:03] teach them see that's the same way God
[1:05:05] does
[1:05:06] us God doesn't God doesn't look around
[1:05:08] and say man why are they thinking this
[1:05:11] why are they but God comes around to
[1:05:13] give us Direction and instruction now
[1:05:16] notice brother Bram says if there's ever
[1:05:19] been anything that's been a thorn in my
[1:05:20] flesh now remember I'm talking about
[1:05:22] spiritual leadings time and place for
[1:05:24] everything if anything ever been a thorn
[1:05:26] in my flesh out in the meeting it's
[1:05:28] someone to rise up when I'm speaking and
[1:05:30] then give a message in tongues and break
[1:05:33] the spirit now notice what happened it
[1:05:35] broke the
[1:05:37] spirit I just come out of a meeting in
[1:05:40] New York in different places to where
[1:05:41] ministers they let that go on time after
[1:05:43] time and it's nothing but a confusion so
[1:05:46] when God is dealing in one line of
[1:05:50] thought Now watch how he he's laying
[1:05:51] this in when God is dealing in one line
[1:05:54] of thought he would be defeating his own
[1:05:57] purpose if he tried to get a line of
[1:05:59] thought to you to the congregation to
[1:06:02] make an altar call in something but
[1:06:05] in so there's a natural
[1:06:09] progression God has an order in other
[1:06:11] words it's not just like you know
[1:06:13] rearranging de chairs and man we don't
[1:06:15] know there's there's an there's an order
[1:06:17] there's a there's a natural progression
[1:06:19] now at the end of the
[1:06:22] service sometimes I know you know from
[1:06:25] from being here with me at times there's
[1:06:26] been a few times where God had us and I
[1:06:29] think a few times where we had a prayer
[1:06:31] line on a Thursday night and I let you
[1:06:33] all know about it I said hey the Lord's
[1:06:34] laid it on my heart that was a rare
[1:06:36] thing I think I can probably count on
[1:06:37] one finger the number of times we did
[1:06:38] that on a Thursday night right so it
[1:06:40] wasn't like some but I knew that in my
[1:06:42] heart it wasn't something I was even
[1:06:43] working I knew that in my heart but in
[1:06:45] the after service that part of it we
[1:06:47] don't know if it's going to be many
[1:06:48] times I don't know it's going to be an
[1:06:49] altar call is it going to be a prayer
[1:06:51] line uh I I don't know what's I don't
[1:06:53] know maybe it's just going to be like
[1:06:54] just a worshiping and just watering in
[1:06:56] the word but that's that's what God
[1:06:59] would have us do and that's a natural
[1:07:02] progression within a service everybody
[1:07:06] with
[1:07:07] me so now brother Bram goes on he says
[1:07:10] for instance he said let's say we're
[1:07:11] sitting at the table and talking and all
[1:07:13] of a sudden Junior runs to the table and
[1:07:15] takes all the attention from what we're
[1:07:16] doing and hollers Dad Mom I just hit a
[1:07:19] home run at down at down at the down at
[1:07:21] the team and we're doing this that and
[1:07:22] the other and we're right down on a real
[1:07:25] sac subject now can you imagine this cuz
[1:07:27] maybe you can't but as a pastor here I
[1:07:29] am sitting and finally it's come to an
[1:07:32] opening and all of a sudden Junior runs
[1:07:35] in you're
[1:07:36] like oh no oh no oh man and because it
[1:07:41] was just a sometimes it's just a small
[1:07:43] little window of a moment or you're in a
[1:07:46] sacred moment with something that
[1:07:48] talking you know with your with others
[1:07:51] and all of a sudden that sacred moment
[1:07:53] of where things are moving into w how
[1:07:55] did that sacred moment come that sacred
[1:07:57] moment did not come just like that that
[1:07:59] sacred moment it came it moves into that
[1:08:02] just like Genesis 1 Genesis 1 the seeds
[1:08:05] didn't all of a sudden just come up
[1:08:07] that's right the first thing be the
[1:08:11] first thing that leads to
[1:08:14] relationship is the
[1:08:16] word the word creates the
[1:08:20] atmosphere it was the word that drove
[1:08:23] back Darkness look you can take Genesis
[1:08:25] 1 and we can preach a marriage banquet
[1:08:27] from Genesis 1 because it's the word
[1:08:30] that drives away Gloom anybody ever been
[1:08:32] gloomy everybody amen down it's the word
[1:08:35] just like when you come and said in here
[1:08:36] it's the word or words our Expressions
[1:08:40] that begin to change the
[1:08:42] atmosphere for what purpose for seeds to
[1:08:45] come forth so God's got a God's got a
[1:08:48] goal in
[1:08:49] mind God has a goal in mind and we want
[1:08:52] to operate within within that right
[1:08:54] channel he's he's got the channel
[1:08:56] already set we want to just operate
[1:08:58] within that now notice brother BR says
[1:09:00] it's a sacred subject and him hitting a
[1:09:02] home run that's all right at the
[1:09:03] baseball game that's all right but he's
[1:09:04] out of order when he breaks in on the
[1:09:06] message that we're talking about let him
[1:09:08] wait till his time comes then he can
[1:09:12] tell us what did at a baseball
[1:09:14] game we've all probably had to tell our
[1:09:16] kids later later later later later but
[1:09:18] when is
[1:09:23] later sometimes I want spiritually word
[1:09:26] but when is later
[1:09:28] Lord so now notice brother re says
[1:09:31] that's the same thing we find with gifts
[1:09:32] today that's the reason God cannot trust
[1:09:35] too many spiritual gifts with people
[1:09:37] they don't know how to control them
[1:09:40] that's an incredible thought so you mean
[1:09:43] that gifts and the gift of the Holy
[1:09:45] Spirit it isn't just like you know that
[1:09:47] I'm just like a you know just like a
[1:09:49] puppet that's just being moved around
[1:09:51] and I don't have no you have control
[1:09:54] over it just like me standing here
[1:09:57] preaching I have
[1:09:59] control yielding is being able to yield
[1:10:03] at the right
[1:10:04] moments there's a control that's over it
[1:10:07] so it's not just something that's just
[1:10:08] loose and well I feel no it's it's
[1:10:10] having a control it's also knowing at
[1:10:12] times because sometimes if you maybe
[1:10:14] could look at the amount that I have
[1:10:16] here in an outline you would say dear
[1:10:18] God I hope he's not going through that
[1:10:19] whole thing don't worry I'm not it's
[1:10:21] it's it's a study it just keeps on going
[1:10:23] but you know what it's knowing win at
[1:10:26] that time to shut down and I'll just be
[1:10:28] the first I'll just be honest with you
[1:10:30] there's been times I've missed that I
[1:10:32] wish I could say it was just one
[1:10:35] time but I've learned and I'll tell you
[1:10:38] this right here I've paid for
[1:10:40] it God has corrected me so you know
[1:10:44] where I would rather be with that is
[1:10:46] when I can see in a certain place and oh
[1:10:48] it might be wrestling Within Myself I
[1:10:50] want to go on this inspiration this was
[1:10:52] the point I was really wanting to bring
[1:10:54] us to and God just is like
[1:10:57] stop and it isn't it isn't You Preach
[1:11:00] until the people are
[1:11:02] dead but it's almost like you're halfway
[1:11:04] through your steak dinner and say hey
[1:11:06] would you like dessert and take it away
[1:11:09] I don't know about you you can tell by
[1:11:10] looking at me I clean my plates you do
[1:11:14] not take my steak away at a steakhouse
[1:11:17] while I got a steak
[1:11:19] Knife don't even take the loaf of bread
[1:11:21] till I'm done with it matter of fact
[1:11:24] bring me a bag and extra butter to go
[1:11:26] home they don't know how to control them
[1:11:29] notice what brother BR is saying here
[1:11:30] don't know how to control that's that
[1:11:33] think about it friends when he's talking
[1:11:35] with Pentecostal people that concept
[1:11:37] goes against the
[1:11:39] grain because what came out of ausa
[1:11:42] Stree that goes against the
[1:11:45] grain brother B says that's what's the
[1:11:47] matter today that's the reason we don't
[1:11:49] have any more than we do he said but we
[1:11:51] find a lot of impersonation of spiritual
[1:11:53] gifts but I don't believe there's so
[1:11:55] here in our church and I'm thankful for
[1:11:57] that I don't believe it's an
[1:11:58] impersonation at all I believe we have
[1:12:00] genuine gifts but we must know how to
[1:12:04] control those
[1:12:06] gifts so it isn't just something that's
[1:12:09] just loose like all of a sudden you know
[1:12:11] somebody you know it drops on you know
[1:12:13] somebody's heart this special just
[1:12:15] dropped on my heart and they stand up
[1:12:16] and just start singing that special out
[1:12:18] of order correct they might have
[1:12:20] received divine inspiration from God
[1:12:23] exactly divine inspiration but the wrong
[1:12:27] time what's the correct time hunt the
[1:12:30] song leader up find out who it is going
[1:12:32] to be leading the next service and let
[1:12:34] them know I have a special to
[1:12:39] sing are you hearing me this is this is
[1:12:41] order because it's not about you see but
[1:12:44] sometimes if we're not careful here we
[1:12:46] are buding in and stepping in because of
[1:12:50] what we feel to do instead of looking at
[1:12:53] the right order but the same you telling
[1:12:55] me that it can be an absolute Godly
[1:12:58] leading absolutely and you will see this
[1:13:01] with different quotes that I'm going to
[1:13:02] read here
[1:13:04] tonight
[1:13:06] hallu so good it's how to control them
[1:13:09] not them controlling us well well I can
[1:13:11] I I got to do it at this time listen
[1:13:13] when you decide let's say you're out
[1:13:15] driving around tomorrow and all of a
[1:13:17] sudden it presses on your heart don't go
[1:13:19] down Cooper Foster 254 but I want you to
[1:13:21] go down and go up here to Lake Road and
[1:13:23] go down maybe that's an impression maybe
[1:13:25] it's a Divine leading oh brother Samuel
[1:13:28] every time he talks to me is a Divine
[1:13:30] leading you might want everybody to
[1:13:31] believe that but I know better because
[1:13:34] the prophet of God himself tells us I
[1:13:36] just read this where he when he was
[1:13:38] being led by the Lord in
[1:13:41] Memphis he thought even when he put the
[1:13:44] thing in the mailbox is this just an
[1:13:47] impression that's right that's so good
[1:13:50] but what he noticed was the leading kept
[1:13:53] moving him in that way
[1:13:56] now he could follow that out there just
[1:13:59] like you could or I could that's
[1:14:01] different but we can't just bring
[1:14:03] leadings into the house of God and
[1:14:06] bringing leadings in here and then we've
[1:14:08] got to do whatever we're led to do
[1:14:11] there's an
[1:14:12] order there is a divine
[1:14:17] order oh my don't you love the Lord
[1:14:21] notice notice here when you look at it
[1:14:24] in the scripture
[1:14:25] Paul said out of love this is out of
[1:14:27] Charity do does not behave itself
[1:14:30] unseemingly that means not proper or
[1:14:34] appropriate it won't do that love does
[1:14:37] not do that now brother brand has asked
[1:14:40] the question you know regarding with
[1:14:42] spiritual gifts and speaking in
[1:14:45] tongues brother BR does he the person
[1:14:47] who's speaking in tongues does he at all
[1:14:49] times have control over the spirit as to
[1:14:53] when and how to act
[1:14:56] yes
[1:14:56] sir the Holy Spirit
[1:15:00] controls it has control of you and you
[1:15:05] have control of
[1:15:07] it how powerful it has control of you
[1:15:11] see it's God moving upon you but then
[1:15:14] the holy spirit is entrusting you as a
[1:15:17] son to know how and
[1:15:21] when time and place
[1:15:26] hallu say God help
[1:15:29] us it's just like time and place when
[1:15:31] God delivers something on your heart
[1:15:33] maybe it's to speak to a loved one it
[1:15:35] does not mean at that moment to call
[1:15:37] them all right it may not mean that I'm
[1:15:41] not telling you that it doesn't I'm just
[1:15:43] saying that in this manner is that there
[1:15:45] are times where God will drop things on
[1:15:47] your heart and it may not be for a
[1:15:50] period of time later before the
[1:15:53] opportunity is presented
[1:15:55] for that to be
[1:15:58] expressed I've witnessed that with
[1:16:00] things I just told you even with the
[1:16:02] things that I'm ministering here right
[1:16:03] here tonight with things and waiting I
[1:16:06] honestly thought at the beginning of
[1:16:08] January last year that I would be in job
[1:16:11] 24 and and getting into these things
[1:16:14] here and laying in Doctrine but you know
[1:16:16] what that's not what God had now I'll be
[1:16:19] honest when I came towards the end of
[1:16:20] the year I thought oh my what's this
[1:16:22] year going to
[1:16:23] hold now moved over that I skipped over
[1:16:26] that chapter and I'm here Lord what what
[1:16:28] what's it going to behold but you know
[1:16:29] what God has everything in time because
[1:16:31] it's not about even of all of the
[1:16:34] wonderful things that I can be studying
[1:16:36] and looking at and outlines and all that
[1:16:38] but it comes down to what is the correct
[1:16:41] thing to be spoken in this
[1:16:47] season so is appropriate times notice it
[1:16:50] has control of you and you have control
[1:16:52] of it it'll never make you do anything
[1:16:55] contrary to the scripture the spirit
[1:16:57] does not misbehave itself
[1:17:00] unseemingly so there's appropriate
[1:17:03] times how many believe there's
[1:17:05] appropriate times it's appropriate times
[1:17:08] appropriate times for singing a special
[1:17:09] appropriate times for giving a testimony
[1:17:11] appropriate times for the gifts
[1:17:13] themselves to operate there are
[1:17:15] appropriate
[1:17:18] times the Bible says quench not the
[1:17:22] spirit
[1:17:24] despise not prophesying every time I've
[1:17:27] ever read this scripture over the years
[1:17:29] I can't help but wonder when Paul would
[1:17:32] write this right here quench not the
[1:17:34] spirit if there's not been things to
[1:17:37] where that within it that individuals
[1:17:39] have not given and release themselves to
[1:17:42] the Lord at the correct time in the
[1:17:44] correct Channel and instead because they
[1:17:47] didn't release in the right way the
[1:17:48] correct channel that all of a sudden
[1:17:50] they just felt like I ain't going to do
[1:17:52] nothing at all and they quenched the
[1:17:57] spirit also wonder when I read this
[1:17:59] despise not prophesying I wonder I
[1:18:02] wonder if when every all the time I read
[1:18:05] this I wonder because just as much as
[1:18:07] the prophet seen so much that was
[1:18:10] standing up he was being interrupted
[1:18:12] even in the brandom Tabernacle brother
[1:18:14] Bram said all the way through the 50s
[1:18:15] all the way through the 60s he gives us
[1:18:17] gives us orders of how that is to be
[1:18:19] done how there's to meet beforehand all
[1:18:22] of those things and how he had that in
[1:18:23] place clear back in the 50s and even
[1:18:26] before that he tells
[1:18:28] us but yet he dealt
[1:18:31] with not only things being interrupted
[1:18:34] but individuals standing up and saying
[1:18:36] behold the Lord is coming and quoting
[1:18:40] scripture and this and the Bible tells
[1:18:42] us that it's not to be vain
[1:18:47] repetitions that's why brother BR tells
[1:18:49] us he said that's what the preacher is
[1:18:51] when he quotes the scripture he said but
[1:18:54] anything that comes forth is to be a
[1:18:57] direct message to
[1:19:00] someone and he likened it Oh my he
[1:19:04] likened it to exactly what takes place
[1:19:07] on the
[1:19:11] platform aren't you glad for
[1:19:14] order I am appropriate
[1:19:18] times now notice brother B is is dealing
[1:19:22] with this here in questions and answers
[1:19:24] and he's talking about speaking in
[1:19:25] tongues don't worry I just engines got a
[1:19:28] little warm
[1:19:30] here in Connecticut I was able to preach
[1:19:32] with it on the whole
[1:19:34] time but uh you
[1:19:37] know with this here brother BR is going
[1:19:40] into you know he's talking about
[1:19:42] speaking in tongues and he'll say this
[1:19:43] multiple places of how he says it just
[1:19:46] comes like such a
[1:19:48] combustion until a person hardly knows
[1:19:50] what they're doing or they're saying and
[1:19:51] he saying the interpretation is actually
[1:19:53] the same way too cuz the
[1:19:55] Supernatural and he says it's like
[1:19:57] something grabs you now I don't have
[1:19:59] this quote displayed I'm going to get a
[1:20:00] part of it here he says it's like
[1:20:02] something grabs you and takes a hold of
[1:20:04] you and you're doing
[1:20:06] it brother Neville steps up brother
[1:20:08] brandom brother brandom he says now
[1:20:12] you're you're you're not intending to
[1:20:13] say brother
[1:20:14] brandham that that a man speaking in
[1:20:17] tongues and service that he wouldn't
[1:20:19] have no control over you because after
[1:20:21] all a man with a gift is supposed to be
[1:20:23] in control over
[1:20:25] brother Neville was a faithful faithful
[1:20:27] student wasn't he because remember
[1:20:30] brother brother brandham had to correct
[1:20:31] brother
[1:20:33] Neville we'll get into that but notice
[1:20:37] when you look at this brother Ram said
[1:20:39] no no he said he can control himself
[1:20:41] whoever it is he can control himself now
[1:20:43] so he's just said this it comes upon you
[1:20:45] all of a sudden but it doesn't leave you
[1:20:48] without control right so it's sound like
[1:20:51] I just can't help myself no you can't
[1:20:53] right he can control himself he says
[1:20:57] you're supposed to be conscious enough
[1:20:59] to know that he's about to speak in
[1:21:00] tongue brother Ram said yep that's
[1:21:01] exactly right that's exactly right now
[1:21:04] notice brother B said say for instance
[1:21:05] now he brings it down for you and I say
[1:21:07] for instance I'm standing here and
[1:21:09] anybody when you're fixing to shout
[1:21:10] anybody ever
[1:21:12] shouted okay about five of
[1:21:16] you did you ever feel the power of God
[1:21:19] come on you when you start to shout said
[1:21:21] how many ever did that well all of us
[1:21:23] have you just sit there you feel it
[1:21:27] coming now there's where you can quench
[1:21:30] it you hold it see it's not
[1:21:34] right I agree there's right
[1:21:37] times I agree there's right times I mean
[1:21:40] what good would it
[1:21:41] do for somebody to be shouting in your
[1:21:44] ear and you can't even hear what's being
[1:21:45] preached I'm listen friends I believe in
[1:21:47] shouting you know that you know that I
[1:21:49] mean no not everybody can be as quiet as
[1:21:51] me I know that but I believe in shouting
[1:21:53] I believe I believe even having a good
[1:21:55] time in the Lord am hey I just don't
[1:21:57] shout when I'm in church I shout man
[1:22:00] when I'm listening to the message but
[1:22:02] sometimes it's kind of hard to shout
[1:22:03] when you're walking in Costco with your
[1:22:05] airpods
[1:22:08] in but I'm in control see I don't say oh
[1:22:12] I can't help it and I tear the the bread
[1:22:14] case apart I just can't help myself
[1:22:19] no I've got control over it I'm really
[1:22:21] I'm not saying things to have to be
[1:22:22] funny I'm just trying to let you brother
[1:22:24] goes into this you think I'm saying
[1:22:26] things right now brother Bram goes into
[1:22:27] this very thing that you and I have
[1:22:29] control over
[1:22:32] it we have control over now watch as he
[1:22:35] goes on he says you just sit there and
[1:22:37] you know you can quench it but you hold
[1:22:39] it and it's not right then he goes on to
[1:22:41] talk about he says let's say here you
[1:22:42] were and you were standing talking to
[1:22:44] the president of the United States and
[1:22:46] you were standing out there talking to
[1:22:47] the mayor of the city and talking about
[1:22:49] something or another and all of a sudden
[1:22:51] a bunch of people come around and man
[1:22:53] you feel like jumping up and down and
[1:22:55] screaming and hollering kicking and
[1:22:58] everything else he said but they'd say
[1:23:00] man that guy is
[1:23:02] crazy but you see if we're not careful
[1:23:06] then here all a sudden a scripture will
[1:23:07] be
[1:23:08] inserted well in the way that's called
[1:23:11] heresy so worship I the god of my
[1:23:14] fathers but the prophet also told us
[1:23:18] questions and answers on the seals right
[1:23:21] don't make yourself odd
[1:23:26] amen don't make yourself odd like
[1:23:28] everything you know it's almost like
[1:23:29] everything is spiritual like oh they
[1:23:31] forgot my fries in my McDonald's I'll
[1:23:34] tell you it must no it there somebody
[1:23:35] just forgot
[1:23:37] it they didn't have the running
[1:23:39] president working there at that
[1:23:42] time it's okay you can but you
[1:23:45] understand what I'm saying sometimes we
[1:23:47] if we're not careful it BEC everything
[1:23:49] becomes like a spiritualization let me
[1:23:52] tell you something right now let me just
[1:23:53] pause as parents that will run your
[1:23:56] kidss
[1:23:57] nuts because that's not real
[1:24:01] life every moment and everything of our
[1:24:04] life does not have to be spiritual that
[1:24:07] proves
[1:24:09] nothing nothing we walk here in this
[1:24:13] life this your life is to show them what
[1:24:16] the Holy Ghost is all about it's God
[1:24:18] living inside of a human being in the
[1:24:21] middle of your temperament
[1:24:26] hallu cuz if you're not careful you that
[1:24:28] can come on and then everything you do
[1:24:31] is absolutely right on the dot thus
[1:24:34] sayith the Lord in your own
[1:24:40] mind now watch brother Bron dealing with
[1:24:43] these things and he says regarding that
[1:24:45] you know not shouting in front of the
[1:24:47] president and everything else cuz people
[1:24:48] going to think you're
[1:24:49] crazy he says you know better than to do
[1:24:52] it right then
[1:24:55] you hold although it's just digging in
[1:24:57] you and you just can't hardly hold it
[1:24:59] yes sir uhuh uhuh oh boy she's digging
[1:25:01] you to pieces but you know to hold your
[1:25:03] peace right
[1:25:06] then some of y'all eat lemons before you
[1:25:08] came here
[1:25:09] tonight or did the deacons pass them
[1:25:15] around I'm preaching the message of the
[1:25:18] hour right here oh I know there's a
[1:25:20] liberty right here I can sense it but
[1:25:22] I'm just looking at this here we know
[1:25:23] better than than that he's bringing it
[1:25:25] down to things that we feel to do it's
[1:25:27] just like I tell you what there has been
[1:25:29] meetings I have set in and you know what
[1:25:32] God had to teach me cuz sometimes I was
[1:25:35] such a knucklehead when I was younger I
[1:25:37] got so excited about the word I still do
[1:25:39] but sometimes I just thought people
[1:25:42] weren't spiritual if they put their head
[1:25:44] down and pluged their
[1:25:46] ear how foolish I
[1:25:49] was you know what God had to teach
[1:25:52] me is try got to contain it here and
[1:25:55] wait for those moments when maybe the
[1:25:58] whole congregation explodes wait for
[1:26:01] those moments just take it in because
[1:26:02] you need to hear I mean I was hearing
[1:26:05] but they need to hear too I'm hearing
[1:26:07] and you know a lot of times with the
[1:26:08] gift of a minister that part within me I
[1:26:10] can work and and I know where they're
[1:26:12] going I begin to things begin to F not
[1:26:14] because it's just a gift in my life and
[1:26:16] all of a sudden I can be racing out
[1:26:18] there and I'm like glory to God and
[1:26:20] they're back here at AB B CDE e f and
[1:26:23] you're thinking Lord have mercy what in
[1:26:24] the world I I must be missing something
[1:26:26] I tell you I must have spent too much
[1:26:28] time on my phone coming here today I
[1:26:30] must and and you know the devil just
[1:26:31] starts beating you
[1:26:33] up but you see how that is there's a
[1:26:36] right time even here because you could
[1:26:38] shout so much to where your wife didn't
[1:26:41] get a thing out of the service so
[1:26:43] there's a right time for everything do
[1:26:46] we believe in shouting we
[1:26:49] do notice so there's a knowing how and
[1:26:53] when
[1:26:55] the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 14:
[1:26:57] 32:33 the spirits of the prophets are
[1:27:01] subject to the
[1:27:03] prophets now brother Bram deals with
[1:27:05] this in correction and everything too he
[1:27:07] says when you go to correct somebody he
[1:27:09] said they get all blow it up at you and
[1:27:11] everything else he said you know it's
[1:27:12] not the spirit of God verse 33 for God
[1:27:15] is not the author of confusion but of
[1:27:17] Peace as in all churches of the Saints
[1:27:21] brother B says this on questions and
[1:27:22] answers on the Holy Ghost he says a
[1:27:24] preacher up preaching in the pull pit
[1:27:26] and somebody will raise up and interrupt
[1:27:28] him and speak in tongues said I don't
[1:27:30] watch this I don't say it isn't the Holy
[1:27:35] Ghost oh Lord you see how easy this
[1:27:39] would be to classify that's an evil
[1:27:41] spirit trying to interrupt him brother B
[1:27:43] just lays this right out for you it's a
[1:27:45] genuine spiritual leading that person is
[1:27:49] feeling a message from God it's the
[1:27:53] genuine Holy
[1:27:56] Spirit but you ought to know how to use
[1:28:01] the Holy Ghost to use
[1:28:05] it can't you see how Satan would wants
[1:28:07] to work on people and defeat people and
[1:28:10] mind us he would love to come against us
[1:28:12] of well I just have to do this and I
[1:28:14] just have to say this and if I don't do
[1:28:16] this and it be and instead instead of
[1:28:19] waiting on our ministry which might be
[1:28:22] the next service it might be the next
[1:28:29] Point instead oh I just have
[1:28:35] to now brother Bram goes in you you most
[1:28:40] of you that uh followed the message for
[1:28:42] any length of
[1:28:44] time you know how brother Bram he'll
[1:28:46] talk about this particular situation
[1:28:47] where this woman and there was something
[1:28:50] in here as I was going just coming back
[1:28:52] over here today I got to look and I
[1:28:53] thought dear Lord I'd never even C it
[1:28:55] like that before but remember the one
[1:28:56] brother bam talks about he was out in um
[1:28:59] in a great meeting Pentecostal meeting
[1:29:01] and and each night what was happening
[1:29:04] every time that he got ready to make the
[1:29:06] altar call that woman would jump up and
[1:29:09] she would speak in tongues and brother
[1:29:11] Bram says it
[1:29:13] interrupted the altar call notice the
[1:29:16] progression of the
[1:29:18] service that the next part of that
[1:29:21] service was alter call
[1:29:24] God said
[1:29:28] that no doubt her she she just felt it
[1:29:31] burning within her she just felt it
[1:29:34] burning within
[1:29:36] her but notice brother R said you know
[1:29:39] when he Billy told him said dad you know
[1:29:42] he came back the third night he said dad
[1:29:43] that that woman she said she's got
[1:29:45] another message for
[1:29:47] tonight what think go for spil in the
[1:29:50] camp he said daddy she got another
[1:29:52] message for you got said said she got
[1:29:54] another message tonight brother BR said
[1:29:56] you know I looked at her bobbed hair
[1:29:58] dress on so tight looked like she was
[1:29:59] poured into and fixing her hair cuz
[1:30:01] every time brother BR brother BR pegged
[1:30:03] it that every time it was getting ready
[1:30:05] to lead into an Altra call she started
[1:30:06] fixing her hair started pulling
[1:30:08] everything up and making sure everything
[1:30:10] was just right he said I know she was
[1:30:13] getting ready to jump up and I said sit
[1:30:16] down she kept on he said I said did you
[1:30:19] hear me sit down why the Spirit of the
[1:30:24] prophets is to be subject to the prophet
[1:30:28] and the prophet is the
[1:30:30] word but remember brother Ram was hit
[1:30:33] with this by many ministers that ran out
[1:30:36] to the car oh what did you do you grieve
[1:30:40] the Holy Spirit brother Bram said any
[1:30:42] Spirit the word will grieve deserves to
[1:30:46] be
[1:30:47] grieved because the word is first place
[1:30:54] and the church
[1:30:55] said now notice when we look at this
[1:30:58] notice B says you know he says here it
[1:31:01] was he said they told me well you were
[1:31:03] up there teaching the word he said well
[1:31:05] that's what I'm standing by is the word
[1:31:08] but she had something fresh and new from
[1:31:12] Heaven something different from that
[1:31:16] brother Brandon watch this statement if
[1:31:18] that isn't back to Roman Catholicism I
[1:31:21] don't know what is w
[1:31:25] prostrating prostrating and maybe say I
[1:31:28] wouldn't have nothing to do with Roman
[1:31:30] Catholicism but
[1:31:32] prostrating before a false conclusion of
[1:31:35] the word of
[1:31:37] God and no doubt this little woman you
[1:31:40] know what brother Bram tells us on
[1:31:41] throughout the message you know this
[1:31:42] you've heard it on tape brother Bram
[1:31:43] said why she did that she wasn't taught
[1:31:46] no
[1:31:46] better she wasn't taught no
[1:31:49] better if she had have been taught
[1:31:51] better it may have been a different
[1:31:53] different outcome
[1:31:54] she won't Tau no
[1:31:56] better oh
[1:31:58] god brother Bram even deals with one
[1:32:01] situation in the pergam and church I I
[1:32:03] can send these quotes to you but I I I
[1:32:05] don't want to put a put every one of
[1:32:06] them up here but brother bram's dealing
[1:32:08] with it and he's he's telling a sister
[1:32:09] she starts to speak in tongues in the
[1:32:11] beginning of the pergan church age and
[1:32:13] brother Bram just breaks right into
[1:32:15] prayer in the middle of that prayer he
[1:32:17] just says Lord when confusion is being
[1:32:20] carried on help us to be our best your
[1:32:23] Serv through Jesus name and he says
[1:32:25] sister you Anointed with the Holy Spirit
[1:32:28] no
[1:32:29] doubt but she had that message after the
[1:32:31] word had already see brother Bram had
[1:32:32] already stepped to the platform he says
[1:32:35] it's just a little bit from out of the
[1:32:36] order of the things
[1:32:38] sister that's all right sister he says
[1:32:40] it's the Holy Spirit on
[1:32:42] you are you hearing me now he didn't say
[1:32:45] you got an evil spirit on you he said
[1:32:47] it's the Holy Spirit on you but it's
[1:32:51] just not in the right order
[1:32:55] right he says you know Sister Deary says
[1:32:58] oh it's I know he says it's hard to hold
[1:33:00] things like
[1:33:02] that he said you know what it was you
[1:33:04] probably felt that before we ever even
[1:33:06] started
[1:33:08] ministering he said but what happened
[1:33:10] was as soon as it it came back when the
[1:33:12] spirit started working it just got so
[1:33:15] heavy on you but see be just because
[1:33:18] that
[1:33:18] happened that was not the time and the
[1:33:22] place
[1:33:24] that's the kind of control not quenching
[1:33:27] it's the control and to realize I have
[1:33:30] not displeased God by receiving
[1:33:34] inspiration and channeling it for the
[1:33:37] appropriate
[1:33:42] time
[1:33:46] now brother Bram says you know it'd be
[1:33:48] just like he says it'd be like you know
[1:33:50] imagine me he said trying up here to
[1:33:52] teach and a man jump up beside me and
[1:33:54] start teaching right at the same time
[1:33:56] that'd be bad imagine somebody just step
[1:33:58] up here Paul get up here and Paul just
[1:34:00] start you'd be
[1:34:02] like what I mean you know you're trying
[1:34:05] to who in the world am I supposed to
[1:34:06] listen to and brother BR is given that
[1:34:09] example he says now imagine you say here
[1:34:10] somebody jumps up beside me and starts
[1:34:12] teaching at the same time another man is
[1:34:14] out there singing a jubilee song what
[1:34:16] confusion that's the way it is about
[1:34:18] speaking in tongues Let It Come orderly
[1:34:20] just as the spirit will give it and you
[1:34:22] speak with tongues well brother random I
[1:34:24] can't help it oh yes you
[1:34:28] can if there be one among you who speaks
[1:34:30] with tongues there be no interpreter let
[1:34:32] him hold his peace no matter how much it
[1:34:35] wants notice it wants to speak not he
[1:34:41] not she it wants to speak hold your
[1:34:44] peace that's a gift brother and I pray
[1:34:47] God will let me have another Revival
[1:34:48] here one of these days where we can get
[1:34:49] into those things for you I'm glad we're
[1:34:51] in the midst of that Revival right now
[1:34:53] AR
[1:34:55] you where you can see watch this it's a
[1:34:58] gift and that watch this is key right
[1:35:01] here that gift wants to operate all the
[1:35:09] time but you've got to have the wisdom
[1:35:12] of the Holy Spirit here to know when and
[1:35:16] how to operate the gift that's what true
[1:35:20] anointing the prophet picks that up and
[1:35:22] and why people are so tossed to out
[1:35:24] that's what true anointing is is knowing
[1:35:26] how and when am right so it's yielding
[1:35:32] to the order of the
[1:35:34] spirit that's why Paul said when I was a
[1:35:36] child right I spake as a child I
[1:35:38] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:35:40] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:35:43] childish
[1:35:45] things there's things that all the way
[1:35:48] through this building that we no longer
[1:35:49] play
[1:35:51] with now some of you sisters if you
[1:35:53] still play with with Barbie dolls now I
[1:35:54] know some of you got some of you got
[1:35:56] kids I know you have to go along with
[1:35:57] all that so your excuse Mr
[1:36:00] Rebecca but you understand brother Drake
[1:36:03] you better not be playing with Barb but
[1:36:05] you understand what I'm saying there's
[1:36:07] certain things that you
[1:36:09] just you lay
[1:36:12] aside and notice notice it isn't that
[1:36:16] God would have you and I to lay aside
[1:36:19] the gifts it's laying aside our ways of
[1:36:25] thinking
[1:36:26] right oh may God help us and give us
[1:36:29] Grace may God my my prayer has been God
[1:36:32] may you give such Grace among us to
[1:36:34] where that there there wouldn't be
[1:36:36] anything in any heart or any life that
[1:36:38] that just so looks at things in a manner
[1:36:41] and well I feel to do this and I feel to
[1:36:43] do this and if I don't do this and then
[1:36:45] they feel defeated oh I pray to God that
[1:36:48] God would bring such a release and a
[1:36:50] liberty to realize that if God puts
[1:36:53] something on your heart there is an
[1:36:55] appropriate time and
[1:37:02] place you see we've got to yield brother
[1:37:04] Ram says this in one of the quotes you
[1:37:06] got to yield to the order of the
[1:37:09] spirit that's what I was quoting from
[1:37:11] you got to yield to the order of the
[1:37:12] spirit you know it would be it would be
[1:37:14] just like the equivalent of a song
[1:37:16] special now there's special singers song
[1:37:20] will drop in your heart sometimes maybe
[1:37:22] what's being ministered here right why
[1:37:24] it's being ministered and it drops in
[1:37:26] your heart the appropriate time is next
[1:37:29] service right not that service right
[1:37:33] because the order specials have already
[1:37:35] been left behind we're Beyond specials
[1:37:37] right now right are you hearing me right
[1:37:41] and then then again it might be
[1:37:42] something God will do right now within a
[1:37:44] person's life maybe it's a Deliverance
[1:37:47] maybe it's a healing and they've got a
[1:37:50] testimony next service be ready to give
[1:37:53] that
[1:37:54] testimony that's the appropriate time
[1:37:57] and place you think it is not burning in
[1:37:59] our hearts you think it wouldn't be
[1:38:01] burning in our hearts sure it would
[1:38:04] be sure it would be I got your attention
[1:38:07] now don't worry I've got a bunch of
[1:38:09] quotes laying in front of me here but
[1:38:10] I'm not going to keep you all night but
[1:38:11] I want to lay this in good so you know
[1:38:13] where I'm coming from there is an
[1:38:16] appropriate
[1:38:17] time when the prophet himself and we
[1:38:19] begin to look at certain things and deal
[1:38:22] with this on the flow of service
[1:38:24] and this is the very thing that when I
[1:38:26] come into this part of it here these are
[1:38:29] things that I know I know there's
[1:38:31] certain things that I put in place years
[1:38:34] ago and just like I told the Lord even
[1:38:37] even the other
[1:38:38] day the blame is right
[1:38:41] here because sometimes when there's a
[1:38:43] little opening and then it just keeps on
[1:38:45] moving in a certain way in a certain way
[1:38:47] in a certain way and then things just
[1:38:50] they just it just starts getting out of
[1:38:51] order little by little by little by
[1:38:55] little and so I stand before you and I
[1:38:58] ask you to forgive me there's a part of
[1:39:01] it to where that I I am held
[1:39:04] responsible when things like this and we
[1:39:06] can look at it and look at different
[1:39:08] things of how that things would flow
[1:39:10] even within a service and you know what
[1:39:13] you sometimes you try things you look at
[1:39:15] things but I also look at it with this
[1:39:18] is what I'm looking at where is the
[1:39:21] continuity a service should not be
[1:39:23] moving like this and all of a sudden it
[1:39:26] comes
[1:39:27] down just an abrupt stop after the
[1:39:31] preaching of the word that is the time
[1:39:35] to
[1:39:37] worship that's the appropriate time can
[1:39:39] I have just a few more minutes flow of
[1:39:41] the service brother Bram you'll hear him
[1:39:44] call this pre-service or preliminary
[1:39:46] that's when gifted individuals are to
[1:39:47] meet that's not if the service is at
[1:39:49] 7:00 p.m. they don't come here and meet
[1:39:51] at 7:00 p.m. brother Bram says it's an
[1:39:53] hour to 45 minutes before
[1:39:56] time right I I'm not going to try to
[1:39:58] break all into all that today that's a
[1:40:01] service in itself this is also the time
[1:40:04] the testimonies are to be given it's
[1:40:07] also the time when Sunday school then we
[1:40:10] come into the song service that's when
[1:40:11] service time starts 11:00 a.m. 7:00 p.m.
[1:40:14] that's when written prayer request
[1:40:17] and if we're not going to give the
[1:40:19] testimony in
[1:40:20] person you can write it like Brother
[1:40:23] Richard
[1:40:25] perfect he didn't know I was going to do
[1:40:27] this but I heard that back there perfect
[1:40:29] it was written testimony got to the
[1:40:33] point Thank God it was part of the
[1:40:35] prayer request we move on it did not
[1:40:38] cause the service to just
[1:40:41] stop right because you see every time
[1:40:43] you stop that's why look look these are
[1:40:45] things when you think I'm saying this
[1:40:47] right here you don't know how often when
[1:40:48] I've talked with the song leaders ain't
[1:40:50] that right over the years
[1:40:53] this guy gets it more than
[1:40:56] anybody you think you all get correction
[1:40:58] my boys get it not just from the things
[1:41:00] in life but if there's anything that I
[1:41:02] don't like per
[1:41:03] se and I'm looking at because it's the
[1:41:06] betterment of every service I want every
[1:41:09] surface I want it to be the best that we
[1:41:11] can be
[1:41:16] amen
[1:41:18] so there's times when we're looking then
[1:41:20] at this right here ministering of the
[1:41:21] word what and like I said before the
[1:41:23] ministry of the word I don't know
[1:41:25] sometimes I don't know what's going to
[1:41:27] what God's going to do afterwards that's
[1:41:29] a time we pray for the sick maybe altar
[1:41:31] calls given maybe it's a prayer line
[1:41:33] maybe it leads into water baptism but at
[1:41:36] any rate brother Bram makes this
[1:41:38] statement when he talks about our
[1:41:40] service he says conserve your
[1:41:47] time conserve your
[1:41:50] time he tells us even as ministers
[1:41:53] he said there's some people that F that
[1:41:56] that that fill up fast other people that
[1:41:58] take a long time to fill up but don't
[1:42:01] try to fill these that take a long time
[1:42:02] to fill up get the happy in
[1:42:10] between he said conserve our time that's
[1:42:13] why brother Bram tells us even when he
[1:42:14] goes into it he said for a person coming
[1:42:16] to pray over the prayer request or
[1:42:18] anybody praying he said it shouldn't be
[1:42:19] a long
[1:42:21] prayer right right now I'm not standing
[1:42:25] over here with a stopwatch but I think
[1:42:26] we can tell when you can look at
[1:42:28] something and say that belongs in the
[1:42:29] prayer
[1:42:31] closet because it's cutting in on
[1:42:35] time it's conserving our
[1:42:39] time if brother Homer if you're
[1:42:41] listening tonight I I hear
[1:42:46] it told me one time he said I asked
[1:42:48] somebody to pray over the food he said
[1:42:50] they prayed so long I told him you ain't
[1:42:52] never praying over a church Fellowship
[1:42:53] dinner
[1:42:56] again that sounds like he know it he
[1:42:59] meant it too he meant it too he said you
[1:43:01] ain't never playing over a Church
[1:43:03] Fellowship meal again I like to starve
[1:43:06] to death he
[1:43:08] said but it's just using wisdom right
[1:43:12] just using wisdom brother brother Homer
[1:43:13] has his comical way but just using
[1:43:14] wisdom but notice well that's what
[1:43:16] brother BR said if you you know when we
[1:43:18] look at this right here you think oh
[1:43:19] brother Samuel I don't know about that
[1:43:20] let's look what brother Bram said here
[1:43:22] in church order 19 58 these messages now
[1:43:24] he's talking about meeting in the
[1:43:26] pre-service right these Revelations and
[1:43:29] people are privileged if they desire to
[1:43:31] raise up and give a testimony a
[1:43:33] testimony only for the glory of God now
[1:43:35] they're not bound to it but testimony
[1:43:37] should be given before the message or
[1:43:41] any song service
[1:43:45] starts that's when it should be
[1:43:51] given so what if I get in here late next
[1:43:55] service let me just say this while I'm
[1:43:57] talking on testimonies testimonies are
[1:44:00] indeed just that testimonies are not the
[1:44:03] Lord showed me this that's not a
[1:44:09] testimony that's saying something that's
[1:44:11] not been proven or judged and it does
[1:44:14] not classify as a testimony that's right
[1:44:18] you got to be clear on these things no
[1:44:21] subversion no getting around a testimony
[1:44:24] is straight to the point of something
[1:44:26] that God has done for you am amen is
[1:44:31] that right now brother B goes on to say
[1:44:34] he says if you've got a testimony give
[1:44:36] it before talking in the pre-service in
[1:44:39] the congregation of the people while the
[1:44:40] spirit is a blessing and so forth or the
[1:44:43] real way to testify is not in church
[1:44:47] it's out in Dark Places Let Your Light
[1:44:50] where it's dark go to the roadh houses
[1:44:52] and different different places where sin
[1:44:54] and things is heaping up and then let
[1:44:55] your light shine there is the place to
[1:44:59] do it but however if the Lord has
[1:45:01] blessed you and give you some great
[1:45:04] special blessing or something you have
[1:45:05] to tell the people do it in the time of
[1:45:08] the other service the pre-service the
[1:45:13] preliminary this is the prophet of the
[1:45:16] hour this is the Elijah messenger that
[1:45:20] laid down the orderen
[1:45:24] aren't you glad for
[1:45:27] it because I've watched this I've
[1:45:30] watched it like I told you I was the one
[1:45:31] that that times over the time and look I
[1:45:34] I've spoke personally to individuals
[1:45:35] already I I've I've it's it comes down
[1:45:37] to me but everything within it for years
[1:45:40] i' I've waited in because I've watched
[1:45:42] it it just everything as soon as soon as
[1:45:44] it would happen and sometimes I would
[1:45:46] tell individuals just wait just wait
[1:45:48] just wait just wait and then I would
[1:45:50] have that pressure on me when I'd go to
[1:45:51] pray for somebody look at because I knew
[1:45:53] as soon as that happened service was
[1:45:56] over it was done and you understand
[1:46:00] friends there's times I would love to
[1:46:02] get out there and shake hands with all
[1:46:03] of you because I love seeing you here
[1:46:05] and I'd love to be able and God has
[1:46:06] given me opportunities some Services
[1:46:08] work that way but then there's other
[1:46:11] services that I have been right here
[1:46:14] even lives right now that are serving
[1:46:16] the lord right here in this assembly
[1:46:18] today sometimes it's happened 25 minutes
[1:46:21] after dismissal
[1:46:25] where the worship has continued right
[1:46:27] along and moving right along you see
[1:46:29] this is why you don't want to start and
[1:46:30] stop I told you with the song leaders I
[1:46:32] told them when you're up here don't get
[1:46:33] up here and talk lead the
[1:46:35] songs because every time you stop then
[1:46:38] we got to get this Locomotion started
[1:46:41] again let's keep it let's keep it going
[1:46:43] down the track where his brother Homer
[1:46:45] would say let's keep this baby
[1:46:47] going let's keep it moving forward yes
[1:46:51] that's good boy he's really going to
[1:46:52] light me up tonight when we get done
[1:46:53] with
[1:46:55] this but why stop it but you see so many
[1:46:58] times it can be stops and stops and
[1:47:01] stops and stops so this is what I'm
[1:47:03] saying if you have a testimony you make
[1:47:06] sure you see one of the deacons see it
[1:47:08] find out who the song leader is and they
[1:47:10] can have you in the prior service not at
[1:47:13] 700 p.m. not at 11:00 a.m. you're not
[1:47:15] cut we're not cutting in to the song
[1:47:17] service because you cut into song
[1:47:19] service then they have then they only
[1:47:21] have so long of time right then that
[1:47:24] cuts into the word and the prophet said
[1:47:25] that's the main thing we're here for is
[1:47:28] the word to punch that
[1:47:32] in just like when I expect even when I
[1:47:35] look at this and song leaders don't know
[1:47:38] it but there'll be a meeting right after
[1:47:39] this at some point in time I expect them
[1:47:41] when they stand here I expect them to be
[1:47:43] in
[1:47:44] control right I told them many times
[1:47:47] before I said what they don't know is
[1:47:49] this veteran right here brother Bill
[1:47:51] when he had when the church was just
[1:47:52] starting and he had to tell people to
[1:47:54] sit down that wanted to take over a
[1:47:57] service those people aren't here but
[1:47:58] they they don't go here but he had to
[1:48:00] tell them to sit down sit
[1:48:02] down because they wanted to take over a
[1:48:04] service they felt like they had
[1:48:06] something to say they had some great
[1:48:08] spiritual edification to the
[1:48:14] church so there's an order we can also
[1:48:19] write our
[1:48:20] testimony now I'm just going to tell you
[1:48:23] don't give me a binder I'm not going to
[1:48:25] be the one reading it anyhow these song
[1:48:27] leaders are but don't give them a binder
[1:48:29] you give them a binder I'll tell them to
[1:48:31] flip to the end and say God healed me
[1:48:33] glory to God thank God for healing so
[1:48:35] and
[1:48:36] so why conserving
[1:48:40] time conserving time I know some of you
[1:48:43] you you know you've laughed and things
[1:48:44] like that and maybe sometimes you know
[1:48:46] like brother Bram says in the in the
[1:48:47] fourth seal there's times it comes like
[1:48:49] that he said I'll do that he said it
[1:48:50] breaks you up and then I'll come right
[1:48:51] back around with something serious I
[1:48:54] understand that but this a serious
[1:48:56] matter yes it is it's very
[1:48:59] serious and I want to see I want to see
[1:49:01] our church I want to see us continue to
[1:49:04] go this is why in that time of the after
[1:49:07] service let me read this and I'm closing
[1:49:09] last
[1:49:11] quote brother brm says now is your time
[1:49:14] to
[1:49:15] worship why do you worship at the end of
[1:49:17] the service over the word you water it
[1:49:21] now worship over the word that's went in
[1:49:25] to your heart that's when we worship
[1:49:29] right I don't want to take his time I
[1:49:31] don't want to take away that time I want
[1:49:33] to move within that time right because I
[1:49:36] can just tell you he's corrected me when
[1:49:38] he's let me know before you took some of
[1:49:40] my time when I went
[1:49:44] over oh God I thank you for his Mercy
[1:49:47] amen don't you thank God for the
[1:49:49] leadership in this hour thank God for
[1:49:51] such leadership and such Grace I'm so
[1:49:54] glad that I'm so glad he's not a come
[1:49:57] he's not ashamed to come by and speak to
[1:49:58] us about these things aren't you to me
[1:50:00] my my heart has just been even as I've
[1:50:02] studied over these things over the time
[1:50:04] it's just been so blessed but I pray
[1:50:07] that I pray that there's things that
[1:50:08] even
[1:50:09] tonight maybe you can look at but I ask
[1:50:11] you just to pray about it and look at it
[1:50:13] and say Lord knowing that I've not made
[1:50:16] these things up that's right I've
[1:50:18] brought it right from the message of the
[1:50:19] hour and right from the scriptures
[1:50:23] and we're just getting
[1:50:25] started do you love the
[1:50:28] Lord amen amen God bless you let's
[1:50:37] stand amen well who's tasked with
[1:50:42] somebody needs to be tasked with singing
[1:50:44] after the teaching like this has been
[1:50:46] laid in it's a little time to worship
[1:50:48] right
[1:50:49] now and who is is uh
[1:50:54] uh
[1:50:56] okay you might be singing
[1:51:00] Acappella is is't the Lord good really
[1:51:03] ain't he good I I I I love the word of
[1:51:06] God Amen and I know that it's things
[1:51:09] that give such a Clarity to our lives
[1:51:11] and we just want to see things just move
[1:51:15] on and on you know what I love
[1:51:17] testimonies as a matter of fact like
[1:51:19] brother Shane and I talked about it hey
[1:51:21] if there's times where I look at it and
[1:51:23] we think hey we we need to do just a
[1:51:24] testimony service on a Sunday evening
[1:51:26] just everybody go get something to eat
[1:51:28] and come on back here and have a
[1:51:29] testimon I'm I'm all for it that that's
[1:51:30] different just having a testimony
[1:51:32] service like that I'm all for it I love
[1:51:34] testimonies amen so don't get don't get
[1:51:37] in your mind that I don't like testimony
[1:51:38] I love testimonies but I like things in
[1:51:40] the right
[1:51:41] time I like it's in its right place
[1:51:44] because like brother bam tells us when
[1:51:46] he'll deal with that pre-service he said
[1:51:48] if we can get that pre-service just
[1:51:50] right and you know the pre-service is is
[1:51:52] even us coming in here early brother
[1:51:54] brah says whether we come here and pray
[1:51:56] at the altar or we go back and we sit in
[1:51:59] our seat and we
[1:52:01] just just Worship in silent prayer
[1:52:05] thinking of the songs thinking of the
[1:52:08] goodness of God that's all part of it
[1:52:11] you realize it you're part of the
[1:52:12] atmosphere do you realize you coming
[1:52:14] here and even as you come in here and
[1:52:17] enter into that do you realize something
[1:52:19] that you might look at and say well how
[1:52:21] significant is that do you realize your
[1:52:23] preparation might have been part of the
[1:52:26] link that brought Deliverance to
[1:52:28] somebody
[1:52:29] else that brought healing to their
[1:52:32] life because brother bam says when we
[1:52:34] can get that time of worship and get
[1:52:36] that just right he said oh how it's so
[1:52:38] easy than for that song service to come
[1:52:40] on board he said then it's so easy for
[1:52:43] the minister to step right in and
[1:52:45] Minister the
[1:52:47] word I want to create the right
[1:52:49] atmosphere don't you love him just
