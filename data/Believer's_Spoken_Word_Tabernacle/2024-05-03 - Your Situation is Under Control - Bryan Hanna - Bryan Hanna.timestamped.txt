[44:40] Exodus 14 and verses 13 and
[44:46] 15 amen it was good to go to Virginia
[44:50] this past weekend being around many
[44:53] Believers and they said there was around
[44:57] a thousand people there at the tent
[44:58] meeting so we just had ourselves a time
[45:01] there and it was uh it definitely gets
[45:04] you on fire for God being around that
[45:06] many people and hearing the word like
[45:08] that that that anointing just comes down
[45:10] in there because there's so much
[45:11] expectation cuz people travel for Miles
[45:14] just to come hear the word of God and
[45:17] amen and if you've never done that or if
[45:19] you think you're too old I don't think
[45:21] you're too old there was definitely old
[45:23] people there and you know and uh you
[45:26] know they were having themselves a time
[45:28] so amen maybe your look of fire went out
[45:31] a little bit that that'll definitely
[45:33] ignite it put some gasoline on it
[45:35] amen
[45:37] amen as we
[45:39] uh open up this service with some
[45:42] scripture just some things that have
[45:44] been speaking out to me and the message
[45:47] why Christ speak that brother brandom
[45:50] preaches um and it says and Moses said
[45:53] unto the people fear ye not stand still
[45:56] and see the Sal ation of the Lord which
[45:58] he will show you
[46:00] today for the Egyptians whom you have
[46:02] seen today you shall see them again no
[46:05] more
[46:06] forever and then skip down to verse 15
[46:09] and it says and the Lord said unto Moses
[46:11] wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto
[46:14] the children of Israel that they go
[46:16] forward amen so brother brandom says he
[46:19] first he
[46:21] prophesize that the Egyptians that they
[46:23] see they're going to see no more and
[46:24] then two verses later he's crying out to
[46:27] the Lord what what am I going to do what
[46:29] am I going to do amen but just want to
[46:32] go down to um Isaiah I gave him the
[46:34] scriptures back there so hopefully they
[46:36] can pull them up for
[46:37] you and brother Brennon brings these
[46:39] scriptures
[46:41] out and uh I just they really touched me
[46:44] and spoke to me Isaiah 469 and10 it says
[46:48] remember the former things of old for I
[46:51] am God and there is n none else I am God
[46:54] and there is none like me declaring the
[46:57] end from the beginning and from the
[47:00] ancient times the things that are are
[47:02] not yet done saying my counsil shall
[47:05] stand and I will do all my
[47:08] pleasure and then one more 2
[47:10] Thessalonians
[47:12] [Music]
[47:14] 2:13 but we are bound to give thanks
[47:17] always to God for you Brethren beloved
[47:20] of the Lord because God hath hath from
[47:24] the beginning chosen you
[47:27] to Salvation through
[47:29] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[47:32] of the
[47:33] truth amen so the god that clares the
[47:37] end from the
[47:38] beginning has chosen you from the
[47:42] beginning
[47:43] amen amen you may be
[47:47] seated and I begin to think about these
[47:49] scriptures and I tell you what brother
[47:52] Brandon's a preacher I have these mamist
[47:54] books that uh my father-in-law
[47:56] recommended and they bring out
[47:58] scriptures and that brother brandom
[48:00] references to and and he he goes into
[48:03] these scriptures and I just begin to
[48:05] think a God that declares the end from
[48:08] the beginning has chosen you from the
[48:12] end from the beginning and no wonder why
[48:14] Satan's mad tonight because this whole
[48:17] life is rigged our life is rigged Satan
[48:21] can do whatever he wants but God has
[48:24] chosen you before the foundation of the
[48:26] world Amen so good amen in John
[48:30] 637 it says all that the father hath
[48:32] given me shall come to me and him that
[48:35] cometh to me I will in no wise cast out
[48:38] and this is the Father's will that has
[48:39] sent me that all that which he hath
[48:43] given me brother BR said past tense I
[48:45] shall lose nothing but shall ra raise up
[48:48] in the last day Amen brother brandom
[48:51] said God cannot draw you unless there is
[48:54] a reason God has got a purpose for for
[48:56] you being here in this Leo Dean age the
[49:00] the last age the darkest age that it's
[49:01] ever been if you can only be get to that
[49:05] place how much trouble you would save
[49:07] God and yourself too amen and my title
[49:11] tonight is your situation is under
[49:15] control
[49:17] amen yes sir and brother Braham says in
[49:19] the message why cist speak now the Holy
[49:22] Spirit has one message speak the word go
[49:25] forward that's right don't cry to me
[49:28] that's the word speak it and move
[49:30] forward thus sayith the Lord that's the
[49:32] message of the Holy Ghost and a lot lot
[49:35] of things today a lot of us are still in
[49:38] that infant stage when God has sent a
[49:41] perfect message in this hour a a a
[49:44] people that's supposed to take a Rapture
[49:46] and we're here here still crying out to
[49:49] God being infants you know I remember
[49:51] brother Samuel saying James browny
[49:53] posted a picture of a grown man sitting
[49:55] in a high chair sucking on a bottle and
[49:58] we may think that's funny but how how is
[50:01] it to God when you know when literally
[50:03] Moses
[50:04] prophesied that the Egyptians that you
[50:07] see no more are going to be destroyed
[50:10] forever when he just passed scriptures
[50:13] just spoke flies into existence spoke
[50:15] fleas frogs spoke to Creation caused the
[50:18] sun to stop shine shining but then he
[50:21] gets to the Red Sea and he prophesies
[50:22] and then he cries what am I going to do
[50:24] what am I going to do brother bandam
[50:26] said oh is if that isn't if that isn't
[50:29] human nature when we come to a trial
[50:31] when God has done so many things for us
[50:34] we get to a test and a trial and then we
[50:36] cry out to Lord what am I going to do
[50:37] what am I going to do but that's what
[50:39] Satan's objective is tonight he wants to
[50:41] fog your mind he wants to block
[50:43] everything that God has ever done for
[50:45] you and he wants you to forget about all
[50:47] the all the things God has brought you
[50:50] through amen and Moses crying
[50:53] out I just referenced to that he he
[50:55] already proved proved what you say will
[50:58] happen I'm with you and here the
[51:00] circumstances Rose in a moment what must
[51:03] I do what must I do hey Lord what must I
[51:05] do do you hear me and he already
[51:08] ordained him and Vindicated him and he
[51:10] proved and worked everything through him
[51:13] and brother brandom said Moses was
[51:15] actually crying out for thus sayith the
[51:17] Lord he wanted thus sayith the
[51:19] Lord and um brother Braham said Moses's
[51:22] call was thus sayith the Lord and a lot
[51:24] of people you know
[51:27] a lot of people listening to the message
[51:29] of the hour today I've heard so many
[51:31] times you know well brother brandom you
[51:33] know that wasn't thus sayith the Lord
[51:34] that wasn't thus sayith the Lord but his
[51:38] very own Vindication calling was thus
[51:41] sayith the Lord know amen and that's the
[51:44] same thing for you if God is calling you
[51:46] tonight that's your thus sayith the Lord
[51:48] you don't need God to do a special sign
[51:51] you don't need to say oh let this Robin
[51:53] you know show up and do this for me or
[51:56] any you know sorcery or witchcraft that
[51:59] they want to say it is you know but we
[52:01] believe in the word of God Amen that's
[52:04] everything that God goes by is the word
[52:06] of God
[52:08] amen amen but brother bam said Moses
[52:12] forgot he predicted the end of the very
[52:16] Nation he was brought up in he goes I
[52:18] hope you understand huh so brother Bram
[52:21] is now picking up typing himself with
[52:24] Moses and I'll get to that here in a a
[52:26] little bit but Moses forgotten brother
[52:28] brandham starts to talk about Moses's
[52:30] faith and how faith is being paralyzed
[52:33] and brother brandham goes through that
[52:36] he said faith is great uh big great
[52:38] muscles with hair on its chest amen and
[52:42] and I begin to think of the word
[52:43] paralyzed what happens when you when you
[52:45] become paralyzed you can't move anymore
[52:48] the muscles that you did have become
[52:50] weak they become flabby and you forget
[52:53] to how to move and and that's when Satan
[52:55] likes to attack when your when your
[52:57] faith is paralyzed that's when Satan
[52:59] likes to move
[53:00] in and brother Bram said what what
[53:03] causes that to happen paralyzing Faith
[53:06] he goes when you when you doubt any word
[53:08] of God just like Eve in the beginning
[53:09] she doubted that one word doubting that
[53:12] one word will paralyze your faith that's
[53:14] right and he said well why can't I do
[53:16] that I ought to do it you know so and so
[53:19] does this why can't I do it you know so
[53:21] and so is in the message you know
[53:23] cutting their hair why can't I cut my
[53:24] hair so and so is wearing high heels in
[53:27] the message why can't I wear high heels
[53:28] in the message you know and you say oh
[53:31] that's brother branham's opinion but his
[53:32] very call was
[53:35] Vindicated his message was thus sayeth
[53:37] the Lord he didn't need to see say thus
[53:39] sayith the Lord after every sentence
[53:41] well brother Brandman says I believe how
[53:43] many hands want to raise up and say I
[53:45] believe the message of the hour amen
[53:48] hallelujah either your faith will
[53:50] paralyze your the glamour of the world
[53:54] or either the glamour will paralyze your
[53:56] faith Faith now you have to take one or
[53:58] the other just like the first sermon I I
[54:01] spoke God doesn't like mixers amen it's
[54:04] either his word or it's not his word
[54:08] amen if you're guilty of the least
[54:11] you're guilty of the whole amen you see
[54:14] the Bible don't change God God don't
[54:16] change he's the unchangeable God and
[54:19] then he begins to talk about lot and how
[54:21] lot and Abraham you know they were on
[54:24] their journey together going to you know
[54:26] Canaan and but then they started to have
[54:28] you know those hard times and then
[54:30] Abraham had to separate from lot but
[54:33] during that time Abraham made that fatal
[54:35] mistake going down to Egypt because of
[54:37] hard times and um I don't know if
[54:39] brother Brandon said this or not I just
[54:42] remember that um I might have been
[54:44] brother Donnie but um just when I was
[54:47] listening to him when I was younger he
[54:49] said that that situation which with
[54:52] Egypt actually influenced lot to go down
[54:55] to Sodom so your decisions that you make
[54:58] with your family with your friends you
[55:00] know your close loved ones you know
[55:03] situations that you make you know in
[55:04] your home you know maybe watching a
[55:07] dirty movie with swearing on it may
[55:09] influence your children down the road to
[55:11] do wrong things amen so true amen I
[55:15] don't think it should be a strange thing
[55:17] like brother Samuel said many times that
[55:19] the the message should be playing in our
[55:20] home amen that's good pre so hard times
[55:25] um begin to rise up so so Abraham but
[55:28] Abraham learned from that that first
[55:30] time in Egypt and then but Sodom lot
[55:33] went down to Sodom and Abraham wanted to
[55:37] keep his eyes on the promise and when he
[55:38] didn't when he kept his eyes on the
[55:40] promise like the last service I was
[55:42] saying he always stayed prayed up
[55:44] looking for that
[55:45] visitation amen but lot wanted
[55:48] prosperity in Sodom but his faith was so
[55:52] paralyzed he didn't see that fire now
[55:55] notice this his faith was so
[55:57] paralyzed he didn't see the fire that
[56:00] was going to destroy that very sword of
[56:03] life he was so consumed with the things
[56:06] of the world what was trying to make his
[56:08] own life prosperous instead of looking
[56:12] to the word of God that he was missing
[56:14] the very signs the message of the hour
[56:16] for his day go by same thing with with
[56:20] Noah's Ark you ever just think to
[56:21] yourself Noah's building this huge Ark
[56:24] and all these animals are going in too 2
[56:26] by two you think people would wonder why
[56:29] are those animals going in but they were
[56:31] so busy and consumed with the world that
[56:34] they missed the very sign the message
[56:36] for their day amen I don't I don't want
[56:38] to be one of those people
[56:41] amen
[56:43] amen and uh brother brandom also talks
[56:46] about the woman at the well her faith
[56:49] her faith was so great that when the
[56:52] very Messiah discerned her heart she
[56:54] began to cry are you the Messiah you're
[56:56] that one that the Bible has spoken of
[56:58] the prophets that have spoken about but
[57:00] when Jesus discerned the Pharisees heart
[57:03] they called him beel up amen that's true
[57:07] same with David and Saul they were both
[57:10] anointed you know but one was man's
[57:13] Choice which was
[57:15] Saul but David was God's choice man's
[57:18] Choice failed first he was anointed with
[57:20] the the vial of oil but David was
[57:23] anointed with the the Horn of oil amen
[57:26] and when they came against the
[57:27] Philistines in the next chapter after
[57:29] David was just anointed they come to
[57:32] that that that battle with the
[57:33] Philistines and
[57:36] Goliath Saul saw a big old great
[57:39] giant 10 n feet however tall he was and
[57:42] I remember my father-in-law studying and
[57:44] he said Goliath had a 30-foot
[57:47] reach couldn't even 30 feet out with how
[57:51] how tall he was his wingspan his Spear
[57:54] and his shield 30 foot reach
[57:56] Saul saw a
[57:58] giant but when David went to battle he
[58:00] went into into into dancing because he
[58:03] knew he took the word of God he his
[58:05] faith wasn't
[58:07] paralyzed he had he had Jesu those five
[58:11] Stones fa a it Faith
[58:14] amen and brother brandom said he began
[58:16] to uh swing that
[58:19] sling amen then that stone went a th000
[58:21] miles per second and struck the very not
[58:24] per mile per second and struck struck
[58:26] that that Goliath in the head and amen
[58:29] and and I just like how David David even
[58:31] spoke of the outcome before it even ever
[58:34] happened he said today I'm going to cut
[58:36] your head off
[58:37] amen and that's that's what faith is
[58:40] Faith doesn't look at the present time
[58:43] faith brother brandom types it as
[58:45] binoculars binoculars are to look a far
[58:48] off
[58:50] Amen brother BR says you don't use
[58:53] binoculars to look to see what time it
[58:55] is right you don't use that but you use
[58:58] binoculars to look way off for you see
[59:01] for you see faith is what God wants
[59:03] done oh I hope this goes in faith
[59:06] doesn't look at the present time Faith
[59:08] doesn't see this here Faith looks to see
[59:12] what God wants and looks accordingly
[59:15] that's what faith does it sees what God
[59:17] wants and what God wants done and Faith
[59:20] operates through
[59:21] that amen and faith faith picks up God's
[59:25] binoculars
[59:27] amen both sides you got to look through
[59:29] both sides the old and the New Testament
[59:32] amen and some binoculars just come
[59:36] preset they don't come with the
[59:38] adjustments but some binoculars come
[59:40] with those adjustments that's why some
[59:42] people can't you try to explain this
[59:44] message to them I you know I I have many
[59:47] people I've witnessed to and I've spoken
[59:49] to them around I was like why can't they
[59:50] see this why can't they see the message
[59:52] of the hour but they don't have those
[59:54] adjustments like you know like we do
[59:56] we're we're predestinated we have we
[59:59] have Malachi 4 who came in our age who
[1:00:02] came in our day to adjust our sights
[1:00:04] were off we were seeing three we were
[1:00:07] seeing blurry Visions amen but God came
[1:00:11] by and brought Malachi for and was able
[1:00:13] to tune our sights amen we're able to
[1:00:16] look far off not not at the situation at
[1:00:19] hand you may be going through a hard
[1:00:20] time with maybe work or a a loved one
[1:00:23] where it just looks like they're not
[1:00:25] going to come to the Lord but look to
[1:00:27] the promise
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:33] amen and also too brother brandham also
[1:00:37] brings out with Moses and
[1:00:40] Pharaoh he looked out there so Moses and
[1:00:44] Pharaoh looked out going back to the
[1:00:46] same um with the children of Israel
[1:00:49] Moses and Pharaoh looked out the very
[1:00:51] same
[1:00:54] window uh Pharaoh seing nothing nothing
[1:00:56] out there but a bunch of mud handling
[1:00:58] people slaves prison being killed every
[1:01:02] day beat with whips made fun of their
[1:01:04] religious beliefs called them
[1:01:08] fanatics but when Moses looked through
[1:01:10] them he looked at them and said that's
[1:01:13] God's blessed people that's right his
[1:01:15] eyes didn't fall on the glamour of Egypt
[1:01:17] it fell on the promise of God Amen and
[1:01:20] that's what he was commissioned to
[1:01:22] do
[1:01:24] amen hallelujah and also bringing out
[1:01:27] the this I love the story of Esther this
[1:01:30] just just came to came to my mind and
[1:01:33] just how she was so directed when the
[1:01:38] king asked for his first wife to come
[1:01:41] she didn't come to him and that's what
[1:01:43] the the denominations are today when
[1:01:46] God's making a call those denominations
[1:01:50] rejected you know rejected Jesus Christ
[1:01:53] so God you know in Revelation I can't
[1:01:56] remember 18 he said come out of her my
[1:01:58] people God's calling a
[1:02:00] bride not a girl not a baby he's calling
[1:02:04] a mature bride amen and that's why I've
[1:02:07] been listening to this message why
[1:02:08] Christ speaks so many times brother BR
[1:02:13] he said speak a baby can't cry or a baby
[1:02:16] can't speak an infant cannot speak it's
[1:02:19] a mature word bride amen and that's what
[1:02:22] God has called us to do in this hour
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:27] but I just love you know we've heard the
[1:02:29] the story of Esther so many times that
[1:02:32] she began to you know the king made an
[1:02:35] order to try to get another bride and
[1:02:38] they came to uh the Chamberlain haii and
[1:02:42] she was the only one who asked what the
[1:02:45] king liked amen they were the ones the
[1:02:48] others she had the binoculars amen she
[1:02:50] had that desire to be adjusted we have
[1:02:53] that desire to be adjusted amen amen
[1:02:56] when when the message comes and it rubs
[1:02:58] you the wrong way and you tighten up and
[1:03:00] you don't want to be adjusted that
[1:03:01] that's the wrong spirit
[1:03:05] amen um Esther wanted to be adjusted and
[1:03:08] she began to she found favor in the
[1:03:11] sight of the king and the only reason
[1:03:13] she found favor in the sight of the king
[1:03:15] is because she put on the Royal apparel
[1:03:18] amen and she was instructed by hegi
[1:03:21] which is our Malachi for tonight amen
[1:03:26] and I just loveed it it the scriptures
[1:03:29] are just so perfect you can't make this
[1:03:31] stuff up it said Esther was brought into
[1:03:33] the King's house the 10th month the
[1:03:36] seventh year yeah there you go of the
[1:03:38] king's Reign amen good yes sir amen and
[1:03:40] that's when we begin to rain when God
[1:03:42] sent uh Revelations 10:7 amen yes sir
[1:03:47] amen so but they're begin to have a
[1:03:50] situation arise with Esther you know we
[1:03:53] know um hmon had evil
[1:03:56] intentions you know destroying the Jews
[1:03:58] he hated Jew the Jews he hated
[1:04:01] Mori and he began to plan plan something
[1:04:05] to destroy the Jews and Esther got word
[1:04:07] of it amen but brother bandam said look
[1:04:11] at tomorrow instead of today look at the
[1:04:14] promise instead of Glamour look at the
[1:04:17] people instead of the organization see
[1:04:20] God did that and I just love in in the
[1:04:23] story of Esther she she comes and wants
[1:04:26] to make her request to the king but it's
[1:04:29] it's death if you come to the king
[1:04:32] without being without being called amen
[1:04:36] sir but in my opening scripture it says
[1:04:39] no man can come unto me unless the
[1:04:41] father draws him amen so brother
[1:04:44] brandham said it was death to go into
[1:04:45] the holies of holies now it's death to
[1:04:48] not not go
[1:04:50] in amen so she made her request before
[1:04:53] the king and the King took down his
[1:04:56] golden scepter amen that was deity
[1:04:59] coming down to earth in Revelations 10:7
[1:05:03] it says a mighty Angel has come down
[1:05:05] deity has come down deity is not in
[1:05:07] heaven anymore deity is on the earth
[1:05:10] amen and his bride yes sir so she began
[1:05:12] to make her
[1:05:14] request and I just I just love it Esther
[1:05:18] had them to come to a banquet hmon and
[1:05:22] the
[1:05:23] king and whenever you make your
[1:05:26] request you know just say hey s why
[1:05:28] don't you why don't you just come along
[1:05:29] I'm going to make my request in front of
[1:05:31] the king amen but it it just struck me
[1:05:34] that Esther didn't make her requests the
[1:05:37] first the first day she had the one
[1:05:41] banquet but then she's like let me wait
[1:05:44] till tomorrow and like I said brother
[1:05:47] Bram says look at tomorrow instead of
[1:05:50] today there you go look at the promise
[1:05:53] how of today Christians rely on their
[1:05:55] senses
[1:05:56] and what they can see and what they can
[1:05:59] understand instead of faith I believe
[1:06:01] something in Esther do you know led her
[1:06:06] not to make her request that day that's
[1:06:09] and after that first meeting that
[1:06:11] banquet hmon got so mad he got a you
[1:06:15] know his heart was hardened just like
[1:06:16] pharaoh and God like I said God is
[1:06:19] declares the end from the beginning this
[1:06:21] is all a setup so hmon haymon's heart
[1:06:24] got so hardened by his wife and his
[1:06:27] friends he went and built some
[1:06:29] Gallows to hang
[1:06:32] morai amen I just want you to see how
[1:06:35] perfect God is if Esther would have made
[1:06:39] her F her request the first day The
[1:06:41] Gallows wouldn't have been
[1:06:44] built hmon so Now esther made her
[1:06:48] request the second day and she exposed
[1:06:51] hmon and those very Gallows that hmon
[1:06:55] built
[1:06:56] was his own hanging amen so just wait on
[1:07:00] the Lord don't be in a rush God has as a
[1:07:03] perfect timing look with those
[1:07:05] binoculars don't look at the clock of
[1:07:08] present time just wait on the Lord he'll
[1:07:10] direct you he'll lead you and guide you
[1:07:12] he'll give you the things to say to pray
[1:07:15] what to do our footsteps are are ordered
[1:07:18] of the Lord
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:22] amen amen isn't God good tonight
[1:07:26] yes
[1:07:27] amen and you know like I said and the
[1:07:29] Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh the
[1:07:31] king of Egypt and he pursued after the
[1:07:34] children of Israel and the children of
[1:07:36] Israel went on on the high high hand and
[1:07:40] that's just what God does he he waits
[1:07:43] time is nothing to God God waits for the
[1:07:46] ex brother B said God Waits For The
[1:07:48] Darkest Hour the darkest moment to come
[1:07:51] on the scene amen just like he did with
[1:07:53] the three Hebrew children
[1:07:57] amen they um they look to the promise of
[1:08:00] God they they built a statue of of
[1:08:02] Daniel you know a lot of people today
[1:08:04] want to build a statue of brother
[1:08:05] Brandon but we're not here to bow down
[1:08:07] to any man we're here to bow down to the
[1:08:09] King of Kings which is the Lord Jesus
[1:08:11] Christ amen amen I I believe brother
[1:08:14] bram's a prophet more than anybody you
[1:08:16] know anybody criticizes brother brandham

[1:08:22] nice you know but I don't I don't
[1:08:24] worship brother brandom you know I
[1:08:26] worship my Lord and Savior
[1:08:30] amen amen but like I said the the three
[1:08:32] Hebrew children didn't look at their
[1:08:34] condition they didn't look that the king
[1:08:36] made it seven times hotter we're here in
[1:08:39] the seven Church age the darkest Church
[1:08:41] age it's ever been the heat is great
[1:08:45] amen but we got to look to the promise
[1:08:47] tonight amen and what did they begin
[1:08:50] they they remembered the law of Moses
[1:08:53] not to bow down before any Idol
[1:08:56] God said I am the Lord your God Thou
[1:08:58] shalt have no Gods before me for I the
[1:09:01] Lord am a jealous God Amen I believe I
[1:09:05] believe they begin to
[1:09:07] remember the the law of Moses the
[1:09:09] prophet that they they that they read
[1:09:12] about
[1:09:16] amen and they they begin to say if if it
[1:09:18] be so our God whom whom we serve is able
[1:09:22] to Deliver Us from the burning fire furn
[1:09:26] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[1:09:28] of thy hand oh
[1:09:29] King but if not be it known unto thee O
[1:09:34] King that we will not serve thy Gods nor
[1:09:36] worship the golden
[1:09:38] image which thou has set up you think
[1:09:41] the devil stopped right there no no he
[1:09:44] did not That's what Satan does he'll
[1:09:46] take you he'll take you all the way
[1:09:48] he'll keep pushing even even when he's
[1:09:51] been defeated so many times you think he
[1:09:53] he would have realized by now amen he
[1:09:56] tried to kill that seed all along even
[1:09:59] he killed he killed Jesus Christ on the
[1:10:01] cross he brother Braham said he he
[1:10:03] couldn't even catch that Revelation that
[1:10:06] Jesus Christ was was the Messiah the
[1:10:08] chosen one and me he lost that battle he
[1:10:12] went down Jesus went down to Hell kicked
[1:10:14] the door open took his keys you know
[1:10:16] brother B I said he think he slapped
[1:10:18] them and then and then left and and and
[1:10:20] Satan still tries to come at us amen
[1:10:24] that's just how dumb he is amen amen
[1:10:26] just remind the devil that's right Jesus
[1:10:29] shows up at The Darkest
[1:10:31] Hour amen it was seven times hotter not

[1:10:37] hotter the most mighty men that were in
[1:10:40] his army Nebuchadnezzar to bind the
[1:10:43] three Hebrew children to cast them into
[1:10:45] the the burning fiery furnace so then
[1:10:49] they began to walk to that fire furnace
[1:10:50] and even those mighty men that were
[1:10:53] pushing them perished

[1:15:23] was dead and he just began to walk
[1:15:25] away and he says but I I turn and look
[1:15:29] back and he said something grabbed me on
[1:15:31] my shoulder and I turned back and

[1:15:50] boy prophesied just like Moses and he he
[1:15:53] was literally going to walk away but God
[1:15:57] in Mercy put his hand on his shoulder
[1:15:59] and turned his heart amen and that's
[1:16:01] what God has done to us today in Le O

[1:21:41] grateful you can see these signs amongst
[1:21:45] us to find out all these signs that
[1:21:48] we're seeing see being taken place that
[1:21:51] spoke of in scripture would take place
[1:21:54] in the the last days all the way from
[1:21:56] Heaven to political Powers the nature of
[1:22:01] people the demoralization of the world
[1:22:05] among the women and how they could do in
[1:22:08] the last days and how the men would do
[1:22:11] and how the churches would do how the
[1:22:12] nations would do and how God would do
[1:22:15] and see it all laying right here before
[1:22:18] us
[1:22:21] amen amen let's all stand tonight and
[1:22:23] just want to as musicians to come and
[1:22:27] just to read a few more things
[1:22:29] here man but brother brandham spoke
[1:22:31] about you know the the world's condition
[1:22:34] about all those
[1:22:36] prophecies but what did he what did he
[1:22:38] speak about the
[1:22:40] bride what her condition would
[1:22:43] be he goes now remember this this is in
[1:22:46] the church age
[1:22:47] book let's um sing um the battle of the
[1:22:52] Lords K of d k of d now remember this
[1:22:55] Christ in the true church is in a
[1:22:59] condition of the book of Acts but the
[1:23:01] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[1:23:04] Antichrist spe would come in the church
[1:23:07] and defile it making it lukewarm formal
[1:23:10] and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing
[1:23:13] his
[1:23:14] Works attempted destruction of God's
[1:23:17] people and the discrediting discrediting
[1:23:20] of God's word right down to the time he
[1:23:22] is cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:23:26] amen so see that's that's how what Satan
[1:23:28] does he's going to come to the very end
[1:23:30] but don't be discouraged brother Bram
[1:23:33] says he fights that he can't stand it he
[1:23:36] knows that if the people get the true
[1:23:40] revelation of the true church and what
[1:23:43] she is what she stands for and what she
[1:23:46] can do and that she can do the Greater
[1:23:50] Works here it is brother Braham said she
[1:23:52] will be an invincible Army
[1:23:56] if they can get a true revelation of the
[1:23:58] two Spirits within the framework it's
[1:24:01] either God working or it's either Satan
[1:24:05] working and I I'm just so grateful for
[1:24:08] this message that has exposed Satan
[1:24:10] we're able to see the
[1:24:12] signs even the and even The Temptations
[1:24:15] in your life I mean just even listen to
[1:24:17] the greatest battle ever fought I mean
[1:24:20] this world is literally going insane if
[1:24:23] this world would just I know they're not
[1:24:25] going to but if every doctor physician
[1:24:30] every person can listen to that message
[1:24:33] this world would be a whole different
[1:24:35] place if they would have just accepted
[1:24:37] the message of the hour this world would
[1:24:39] have been a whole different
[1:24:43] place God's spirit discern him withstand
[1:24:46] in the Antichrist spirit saan will be
[1:24:49] powerless before her and brother bam
[1:24:52] said I'm so glad that a man can live so
[1:24:55] close to God till the devil don't know
[1:24:57] what to do with
[1:24:59] them amen pharoh or uh

[1:25:11] days we're just we're just going to keep
[1:25:13] speaking that well we are speaking that
[1:25:15] word right now but one of these days
[1:25:17] says just like just get out of here and
[1:25:20] once once we I believe there's people on
[1:25:22] Earth that are realizing who who who we
[1:25:25] are and this Rapture is going to happen
[1:25:28] any
[1:25:29] moment brother bam said the bride will
[1:25:31] not be here when a a nuclear bomb or an
[1:25:35] atom bomb goes

[1:25:44] person here this morning that feels the
[1:25:47] holy spirit in in in our presence now

[1:25:53] of prayer that you you prayed has been
[1:25:55] answered in the presence of God every
[1:25:57] man who wants the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:00] Ghost he goes if you'd feel that little
[1:26:03] Grand feeling saying I believe that's
[1:26:04] the
[1:26:06] truth you he brother bam says you take
[1:26:08] that he goes That's the evidence of an
[1:26:11] answered

[1:26:26] world or a condition where it looks all
[1:26:29] hope is lost or you know something you
[1:26:32] may be have struggled with for
[1:26:35] years but that that little faith that
