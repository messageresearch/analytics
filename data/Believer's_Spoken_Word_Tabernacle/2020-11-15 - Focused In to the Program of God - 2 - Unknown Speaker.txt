[Music] the my love [Music] holy holy [Music] name God bless you I ask you to have your seats just for a moment here before we get into the word and just so thankful for what the Lord is doing in our midst am amen and I just really just appreciate how that the Lord just you know allowed brother Wayne to come by and uh to be here with us and to minister the word of the lord we had it set up for a few months and it just it worked out in that way and uh we just we thank God for that and then brother brother Andrew being able to to come by and you know you you look at everything that God has the gifts that he places within the body those gifts are for him to use for us now you recognize that many times a person can walk right by a gift of God think when Jesus stood there at the well and he's speaking to the woman he didn't try to convince her of the gift of God but yet that gift of God was for her the only thing that had to take place is how that God would come down and God would use that gift she would recognize that was a gift of God for me and when she could recognize that brother Brandon puts it this way in spiritual food in due season he said God comes down and he embodies himself in a gift and he said yet you have to be gifted to believe it and he said so then actually said it's how God is working between the gifts in our life and that's the secret food I tell you friends if if only a person can see well God sent a prophet or God did this you miss everything right to not see God present in his bride body the same today as he was yesterday to not see that is to miss really what the message is all about because it is Christ in you it's God who has come to identify himself in flesh amen the ministry of Malachi 4 was to call us back to where the church had fallen from amen that it would be a real uniting to where it is now Christ and his bride not two separate people but one amen it's a union amen a word that brings a union in this hour and we just thank God for that and I thank the Lord for the gifts in the body and every gift I'm glad every gift isn't the same you ever look at a flowers I came in last Sunday and had a a bouquet of flowers on my desk back there and uh you know you look at those flowers and I know sometimes I've had my you know wife and you know probably you do too and if you don't maybe you can just take this little hint when you get a red roses well they're all red but you know sometimes they'll put like little white Parts in there and what it does it's the contrast that actually cause things to stand out you know that's the how it is even in our life there's a contrast that allows the real God to stand out in our life there's things that God even has there's things even not only in gifts but even in our own life there's things that allow God to stand out just like in our life there's strengths there's weaknesses but in it all it's not our strength that God is using it's not all together our weaknesses it's those surrendered to him and it's God using them and that's what we want that's what we we thank God for that of the the great bouquet of flowers and for each and every one because we all we all are we are together in this in the economy of God and we that's that is a that's something that is so uh becomes very much more precious to us in this hour I just say it like this yes we have family I have family in other places but you're my family you're my family I make decisions based on you above my natural family because this is the family of God this this is what this is what is really more real to me than that natural family we love our natural family thanks be to God we recognize there's another there's a greater family that we're a part of and that's the family of God we came from that tree and now we're identified back into that tree amen so we we just we just love the Lord and I want to uh this morning um want to present here uh another uh brother here uh at the request of the trustees and as they express their desire to see younger ones carry the burden uh that they have carried Faithfully some of them since the beginning of the assembly uh along with the trustee board and with myself we would like to recommend to you brother Shane derot to sered this local body of Believers in the office of a trustee and we certainly thank the Lord for brother Shane and his lovely wife sister Lily and uh thankful For What the Lord Has Done and what he's doing in their lives and um after asking brother Shane to prayerfully consider this he convited that those are things that he even that in their time of devotion and praying is that they asked God lord what would you have us to do you know that's the first thing that when God met Paul on the road to Damascus Paul when he saw him and God spoke to him he said what would you have me do and you know that that's that's not just you know an office in a church you could pray people could have an office in a church and miss it but it's the reality is is that's when God speaks to a heart and that's where where surrender comes what would you had me do you recognize my purpose is greater than what I thought it was you can have all sorts of Ambitions in life but if the Ambitions themselves are not under the leadership of the Lord we've got the wrong order so we just ask brother Shane to prayerfully consider this and he confided that even the burden that the Lord had already placed on his heart so we'd like to present him this morning and take a vote and um I want you to remember I almost have to say this tongue and cheek now uh but remember the vote it's not almost as we do in this nation and you could say I hope not I hope not um but uh this one here we don't have any machines that'll skew votes or nothing like that um what we want to do is we just just buy an uplifted hand but we're going to ask you to Bow your heads in just a moment just to remember this vote it's a vote of confidence in the leading of the Lord so let's just bow our heads and as all our heads and our hearts are V and as every member of this church that comes here regular supports it with your tithes and offerings which is considered a member of this church while myself alone looks I would ask if this church finds brother Shane derot to be a just man and eligible by the best of your thinking to be a trustee to serve the local body here if you do signify by the raising of your hand okay put your hands down if there's any contrary would you raise your hand at this time okay let's raise our heads amen God bless you brother Shane it's 100% across the board I'd like to just ask brother Shane he'd go ahead and come on up and I want the the brothers deacons trustees I'd like you to come and we just want to pray amen with our with our brother and uh I want you to I want you to pray with us you amen because I want you to understand the offices of the church they're offices indeed of the church they're for you they're for you they're for us so we want to stand here and just ask God's wisdom now I tell you every one of us including myself because every one of us brother brand would say it like this in total Deliverance he said remember they're your deacons they're your trustees he said these men he said they'll make them mistakes he said but you you stand with them and so this is what we want to do that's why we pray for one another we pray for those and we just want to just pray that God will just just take that burden he's put on his heart that burden that's there and that the direction the fruition and how God will just bring that out because that's going it'll be a blessing for the kingdom of God let's just bow our head together Heavenly Father Lord as we just thank you dear God in this hour that you are still calling lives dear God we see you Lord the apostolic age continues Lord the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just as sure today Lord as it was oh God when it came there on the day of Pentecost and Lord to see how you've taken a hold of brother Shane's life dear God and Lord God as in his heart Lord have just been so zeroed in Lord upon you dear God the burden you've placed B on his heart Lord dear God as he stands Lord to take upon this burden Lord to serve this local body as an office of trustee Lord to know that God he and sister Lily together Lord it'll be dear God together and we ask that God that you would just continue to give our brothers strength and Leadership Lord God I pray the wisdom Lord God in these times Lord for I think of how that you called bezel Lord and Lord as your word was spoken through the prophet Moses you said I filled him with the spirit of wisdom and Lord we know that God they took Lord the natural elements Lord all of those things and they Lord God went forth under that Vision that there would come forth a place Lord that you could come and abide and dwell now Lord we ask that you would give that same wisdom dear God to our brother as well guide and direct him Lord over the things Lord that God throughout the properties the natural part Lord in this assembly Lord that the spiritual might be unhindered Lord father we ask it Lord as we just Lord stand Lord to dedicate Lord our brother in this office we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you brother Shane amen let's stand if we will at this time and we just want to look into the word of the Lord and thank the musicians certainly appreciate them and let's turn to Genesis 22 this morning if you would and we want to just read a few verses of scripture and um this is a what I just where I was trying to get to one of the Thursday nights here and we just just the Lord had other plans to to come forth for with some things so we want to just look at a few verses here this morning and there's no way we'll get fully into it but Genesis 221 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am God knew where to find him right he said Abraham he called him by his Priestly name Abraham he said behold here I am what a wonderful amen place to be standing to know you're standing in the word of God behold here I am I'm standing Lord in all that you've revealed and made known to me to this time this is where I am and he said said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him I want you to catch that went unto the place of which God had told him he wasn't going somewhere that hadn't already been told to him right then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off something about that Third Day on on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off amen I'd like to speak to you on focused in to the program of God Amen may God bless you as you're being seated this morning may he bless his word the scripture that we see here in verse one uh you know through the scripture I probably as a Bible reader you've taken these things before and looked at them you find it over and over through the Book of Revelations after these things after these things there's a lot of things that we can go through there's chapters and so forth that of Trials there's chapters of disappointment and trials are not disappointments trials are where Faith itself is manifested you know our life itself it's not it's not a a picture book uh being an elementary teacher I happen to like P picture books but our life is a chapter book and there's chapters in our life and there's chapters and and parts within our life and so there's always a progression there's always uh it hones in you know as you read in on the book and you start to look and find the plot and what's the direction of the story you you start to hone in on all that and then that is the reason really why you have other characters coming in sometimes at first you don't understand why did this character come in or why did this one but as things go on and you're able to come into a place in the book where you can kind of start to look back you think oh now I see why this one had to come in and why this one had to come in and and so we look at it that the Bible itself it's it's it's one it's the expression of one great goal and one achievement that God has had all of all of the the the the saints of God everyone down through time even as we read this with Abraham were actors in The Great ofc economy and program of God they weren't just doing something just to do it they they were inspired it was it was the same inspiration of the Holy Ghost that would strike the heart of a believer that inspires you in the word that inspires you to live a dedicated holy life that inspires you to separate from the world and all unbelief a church can't do that it takes God to do that you see this is this is where Abraham comes in to a place and it's after these things that we find as the scripture said and after these things this is after ishmail has been removed this is where ishma has been sent Hagar and Ishmael because you could not have them there together because ishmail was the one who now begin to jostle and tease and make fun of the very the very one Isaac listen this was not just a normal boy Isaac yes as far as in the flesh but to remember this was a supernatural promise that if it hadn't been for the intervention of almighty God Isaac wouldn't have been there amen amen it was Supernatural Isaac's birth how Isaac came into manifestation it was according to the promise now when after these things the separation has taken place there had to be a separating of the shock you know the shock itself and I say this just because maybe some newer younger ones the shuck itself is the last thing that holds to that seed in a wheat plant it takes seemingly the form of what what would we would say the seed and many can look and say oh the seed but remember the shu is not the seed It's the final stage before the seed you can see it more clearly you can see that life that brother BR said that something that moved all the way through the wheat plant but now it comes to a place that the Shu must give way that the seed can express and reveal itself it was necessary that the word itself would bring a separation with the Shu you see the Shucks hinder the seed right amen the Shu hinders the working of the sea this is why the word itself it can go forth it doesn't have an effect on anybody else others you know you could talk to others and they'll say oh yeah the church down the road they preach Jesus they miss it they miss entirely we're not talking about a historical God we're talking about what God's program was when he became flesh that that same God would come and manifest himself in a body of Believers there was a purchase made there was a claiming that was made that that he might come and live in his people amen so it's had to come to a place this is why even throughout the course of time and years we find the shock you find this one goes away this goes away Shu has to pull away because the seed is to declare or be fully declared amen now notice when it says the Lord and the scripture said he went unto the place that the Lord had told him of now you know we we look at sometimes we we can look at things and think well it was just just something of a of just word but remember Jesus here says in John 5:19 he said the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father doing amen you see Jesus was saying I I am here to act out what I see the father doing right the word moves and you begin to see it you can't explain it but you see God moving in your life and here you are yielding to that you're following that pattern that God desired to restore he shows you his word and you walk by faith and where you walking you're walking to and in the direction till my faith becomes sight amen like God makes you a promise of healing in your body let's bring it down very simple in a healing in your body and listen you can start out your faith my faith but we need God's faith to come behind our faith amen is that right and so we want to yield our faith and then within that then it comes to a place once it drops in your heart you might be riding your truck you might be on the job you might be in in you might be praying you might be sting here but it's God sovereignly doing it amen amen and when it comes to that place it's finished I don't care what doctor's Reports say it's done right and you're walking on and they'll say how can you say that how can you walk that way you're not walking by wishful thinking there's a certainty in your life you've got a straight direction of where you're going you're looking at it and saying God has spoken and this is what God has conf confirmed to me you are journeying by faith until your faith becomes sight in other words that promise you have seen it it has become something that is so took a hold of you you cannot even explain it when they say well how could this be or how could that be and you can say I don't know but I believe it hallu Hall faith is not something you can explain amen right a matter of fact faith when you can that's intellectual Faith but Faith itself is something that just stands right there and Against All Odds Faith said God said it it's finished Hallelujah he saw this mountain in a vision Hallelujah this was the final mountain in his journey come on somebody it was the final time you know in your journey you got valleys and mountains this was the final place in his journey it was not a valley it was a mountain right amen oh my I just don't want to get ahead of myself you see just as a Believer this is this is Simplicity of how God the Simplicity of how God would Quicken a promise to a Believer and you walk toward that promise think of it on as they before they came to the day of Pentecost remember they were ready to go back into their own ways but he came they were talking about him oh God help me this morning they were talking about him they didn't understand what they were saying and they couldn't figure out what had happened we thought he was to be the Redeemer but you see because there was a longing there was a cry for him to come and to reveal what these things are he stepped out he stepped out and he energized their faith Hallelujah yes Lord amen Peter's Faith failed him right are you with me but not after Pentecost brother amen amen are you with me he had the big brother behind his faith then woo Jesus Hallelujah standing right there in that promise he quickened to them the promise the Bible says in the Book of Luke they went to the upper room with joy yes amen they knew the promise was certain let me just say this to you right here if you've not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost the first thing you need to do is say God let the promises be made quick to me that that's my promise I'm telling you the devil will try to talk you out of it a Month of Sundays he try to run you this way and run you that way what should I do focus in on the promise and know the promise is not maybe not perhaps but the promise is repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's your promise Brother Sam you don't know how vile I am God didn't call you because you were good or because you were vile every one of us were and Rob sorry for being so plain but it's the truth God didn't call you and say oh God maybe call this guy this guy was a goody God don't call People based on that there was Nicodemus a man you couldn't touch his life and Jesus said you must be born [Applause] again in order to see the program of God so I say to you that promise is to you brother Brandon when he would have those as they're praying with others he said you have those as they're praying with others and you come there and you assure them you let them know this promise is for you the promise of the Holy Ghost is for you let me just say this to you you may not be in an altar right here because you don't have to be in an altar to receive the Holy Ghost amen come on now but let me tell you what God is doing God takes his word and he vindicates that word and he's speaking to you lift to ear and let you know this is the promise for you this is the promise is for you the Holy Ghost is for you this is for you Hallelujah he's the David in the camp that challenges the Goliath Hallelujah this is that promise that Peter could identify this is what Joel has spoke of see there were they went up there and the word that that had been spoken it gave them a vision when they went I remember they were kind of lingering around a little bit they were just watching and the angels what are you standing here looking at gazing that they didn't you know they didn't sprinkle pounded sugar on them they're letting them know you've seen him Ascend this same Jesus that you saw Ascend he will come again in like manner now go get ready for him is coming it one enough they could have stood there on that spot they could have built churches on that spot that is not the program of God the program of God he's going to come the same way what he first will come in clouds hallelujah amen is that right then that makes way for the Corporal coming and he lets them know go go and you must receive be endued with power from on high hallu they went with a certainty until faith became sight Hebrews 121 the Bible says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which death so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us man let us lay aside every way something's slowing you down get rid of it if it's a bad attitude unload it right if it's a grudge unload it come on now if it's hurt unload it don't unload it on your on your neighbor don't unload it on somebody else cast your cares on him amen unload that weight it's slowing you down right the sin that does so easily in snare trap besets you lay it aside you see this is the authority looking at what God has done through the other Witnesses staying focused on that word you'll never get anywhere looking at your own self the word never come to have you focus on you the word come that you and I might be focused on him he's the one that we re receive strength from I agree that you first need to see that you ain't no count and you need you need help from God and may God help us as the prophet put it in perfect strength may we never rise above the dust of that Damascus Road amen because when we do God can't use us but I noticed this this the next p this next this is how we do it looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith there ain't nothing that you can take credit for and say well I believed on the Lord I did this no even that to believe on the Lord is a gift of God amen amen God inspired your faith for that moment when God called Abraham out of the land of CH this is a supernatural calling it's a supernatural calling now think of this looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith so where are we looking when we we're looking as we've read here before we're look with patience laying aside wait wait lay aside every sin that dother beset us and and run this race with patience with an endurance or as the Lord spoke to brother Andrew here on Thursday night an experience that holds out right amen we believe in Emotion I think God clearly even not only on Thursday but has been even expressing that listen we don't base our experience on emotion it's got to be a word experience amen it'll be there there's emotion that comes out of our life are you under are you with me but it's got to be something founded in the word this listen it wasn't God against this generation when he told him and when he said don't rest just because you preach don't rest just because you had a sensation don't rest he said just because you enjoyed the word but let it be to where your life has been so changed to where it's Christ on the inside of you than to where it puts you in the word hallelujah I'm tell you if somebody saying they're born again and they're not fully in the word they're not born again it's to be walking in the word for our day amen is to see the program of God hallelujah this is a time of finishing yeah Hallelujah looking unto Jesus man let me get to this looking this word look here oh I love this it means to consider attentive to turn the eyes away from other things hallelujah amen Jesus I want you to turn my eyes no he said you turn them from you turn the eyes away from other things a lot of things going to try and try to get you distracted turn your eyes away from other things and fix them on something this is where that our vision has got to become singular H Allelujah turning our eyes from things and becoming fixed on something the Bible said we have a more sure word of Prophecy and Peter under the inspiration admonishes where where you do well to take heed unto this word that God has Vindicated as a light in a dark place amen I tell you the world is a dark place amen yes when I say world I'm talking about religion I'm talking about churches Darkness Darkness is void of his life you see brother BR would say it like this he says we look for Christ to appear the same Jesus when he was on earth a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for I'll be with you to the end of the world that same one who could direct the word and be the word and direct it right straight to the Target that same Lord Jesus is here this morning in the form of the Holy Spirit to direct our thoughts and focus down his word to one true and living God to one purpose to one achievement and if we'll just let him do it right he will focus the word right into a place that'll prove he's the same yesterday today and forever depends on what you want to look at right this is what I want to look at this is what I want to seeall we must focus our lives not what somebody else says but focus our lives to him and he is the word if we get our lives lined with the word then the word and our life becomes the same he said if you abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will it'll be granted to you you see what you'll be asking you'll be asking according to the word that's abiding in you and you in it amen he becomes the central focus of that life amen you know these glasses I had to go had to bite the bullet and go ahead and get bifocals or whatever you call call them they don't have the line in them cuz I got tired of reading medicine bottles like this or print or when I'm in my office immediately the glasses go off up here I take them off cuz I sweat but I would go off in my office and I read my Bible read my computer screen because I get tired of taking them on and off and this and that looking and everything else and these things you know as somebody told me before I didn't understand it they but the doctor told me he said here's the thing he said they not hard to get used to but you just got to remember what you want to look at you need to look at it you point your nose at it right he said because your peripheral you're not out of my peripheral anything getting a little bit over here it's it's I can't see it I have to stay it it's focused in here now when I look at that the peripheral sometimes and we understand you got to have peripheral when you're driving right come on now don't get technical on me now but sometimes it's the peripheral in our life that gets us distracted amen peripheral can come catch a little bit of glimmer of White Woo how big is that one are you getting you know there's Brown that's a dog you you know you start you catch a little bit of perimeter a peripheral and to take your eyes like my wife said get your eyes back on the road right you can't shoot them anyhow you see you see something out of the peripheral but this is where God would put you and ey this hour our life we're not walking out of the perfield sure we know things are going on but there's got to be such a focus in our life to our life is not dominated by what's happening in the world the peripheral but it is focused in on Jesus Christ Hallelujah like that young man he came up and he played man he played a a good piece on the Pian everybody standing oh that young man came mountain and he just stood there and his eyes was not even down here his eyes was looking straight up everybody what the guy's not even bowing or nothing but but then they asked him what's going on said I appreciate all those Applause he said but I didn't he said I'm not looking for your approval he said my master is standing in the balcony Hallelujah and I want to know what does he think yes what does he think Hallelujah if he abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will it'll be granted to you verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you have said oh my not what I said what you said you can have because you and he become the same because the mind that was in Christ is in you and the mind that was in Christ was to fulfill the father's word amen if that's not your desire this morning then you need the mind of Christ amen which was the word there you are then you and the word are focused in together you become a living unit of God right how many know he's the high priest of our confession that means to say the same thing he's not just my high priest because oh I make mistakes no it's much much deeper than that amen the high priest is one who stands there ministering the sacrifice on my behalf this word that's coming forth our high priest is the one who is moving in the assembly he's touching our life he's energizing us to ask for those things that he's inspiring to our heart I want to fulfill the word of my father Matthew 6:21 where your treasure is there will your heart be also the Light of the body is the eye if therefore th eye be single somebody say single single thy whole body shall be full of light this word single means and it's derived with a union with the alpha it's to be United with God to where you're no longer two separate people amen amen to where the message is here and you're here come on now you come to church but you live a totally different life you say what do I need to do get United with the Lord Jesus Christ then it's no longer you living it but it's Christ Living it through you your every desire your every pulsation is to please him this is God's desire for our lives brother brand put it very clear and Christ is the mystery he said now God wants to get it so plainly to us he said but we we we get in the way he said we let so many other things take it away well I can do this and I you can't do it I'm not just talking to people who need the Holy Ghost I'm talking to every one of us I know sometimes it's easy you get a couple good weeks and a couple good days strung together and your flesh gets a little puffed I'm going to preach and you know what it's setting you up for a place for God to say your flesh ain't nothing this is not your work you are my workmanship Hallelujah we get the feeling good what does that do it tightens up and restricts the flow of God oh my God help us to stay yielded simple this is why the word here single it's the same word uh it's a word that we can also remember Paul said uh you know Les Satan would come and and remove from the uh the the the the Simplicity of the mind or the Simplicity that's in Christ you see to be simple means to present no difficulty man when I was in math class I likeed simple math I'm not much of a algebra guy sure wasn't much of a trigonometry or calculus guy if you're those kind of people God bless you when I need a job done for something like that I'll call you but that that that to me I didn't enjoy that but I like things that's simple the gospel is really simple God's desire is for our life to be very simple to present no difficulty hallelujah oh my no wonder Paul said I have to be simple daily I have to Die daily right right because you know we're not divided we're not to be divided but we're to be wholly devoted to him to the program of almighty God which has been identified by the holy ghost in the word you see when the scripture when it's when it expressly States arise and shine or Paul would write by inspiration thou that sleepest awake he would speak uh you know awake arise and Christ shall give thee light arise arise and shine it is a declaration of the word that is coming to bring light to light up the promise right to light up our lives with the word light and our lives that our lives would shine with the light of God which is his revealed will think of this the Bible says but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness how can Darkness how can light be Darkness because light is referred to understanding light John 1 his life was the light is that right right so if the understanding lean not to your own understanding if that life in you is evil it's still that old life oh it is complete darkness this is why there's got to be a change your body and my body when they take X-rays there's light in our bodies is that right but make sure the light in your body is not Darkness let the light meters of our life be surrendered to the shakina light the Holy Ghost God and God pushes these light meters in the right direction hallelujah it's a messiah Anointed with his Spirit moving in his word read another same portion of scripture from Luke no man when he lighted a candle putteth it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a Candlestick that they which come in may see the light notice the candle was lit in order to be displayed right the candle itself is not what lights up the room it's the flame Hallelujah that has come upon the wet amen but the candle has a wick the candle has something that the fire is able to come and the Fire doesn't consume it but it gives light hallelujah amen and the Candlestick that we're talking of it's talking of that Gene seed of God that was in your life amen that was the place that the quickening power of God when God would light up the promise in this hour and say arise and shine he was calling to that place on the inside it's that place that is reserved for God it's that seed that soul that God comes in a temple not made with hands and God comes and SATs down on the throne of that life Hallelujah and he reflects his life through your life it's put on a Candlestick so that all might see the light Jesus said I am the light of the world as long as I am in the world right he ascended up and he sent back the same light that he was illuminated with oh Hallelujah notice verse 36 If thy whole body of Luke 11 be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light I may say God I want to be full of light Lord Proverbs 4:18 the path of the just is as The Shining Light that shineth more and more to the perfect day oh my I want I I want to I want to just lay this in in Matthew 24:17 for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be it's a quick lighting upall the word shine it means lightning shine it's to light up the coming of the son of man listen the world itself the world is not going to catch the Corporal coming right that is to the elect only now when he's coming back makes himself known to Israel this is where things will be able to be seen within that whole time of revealing this is why that seven seal it is an unfolding of his coming many parts the most important coming the most important coming that ties you in to the promise is the coming of the Holy Ghost in you are you with me that ties you into the coming yeah so you see it shineth and lightning you can't just walk outside like you do for the stars and say wow look at them not for lightning right you can say my did you just see that no you might catch a glimmer how many of you ever seen something you know a glimmer right you know seen a glimmer of the light but you didn't see that lightning right but it's telling you of that short quick work that's what's going on God spoke in the Philadelphian age not the lady of seeing behold I come quickly he announced it in the Philadelphian age I'm coming quickly he's identifying it this is the age of the short quick work my you see how the mind goes oh short quick work uh 35 it's been let me see here 55 years short quick work in the economy of God absolutely Amen in the economy of God Calvary was only about 3 minutes 3 minutes ago hallelujah it's not how we count time no it's when we get caught up in time is where we can get LAX right are you with me amen we listen let me just drop this in here we are not we do not regulate our lives by the calendar right in some ways I understand we do we prepare for winter and everything like that but in but I'm talking about spiritually what affects our Liv and the way things are directed God gave us a Time piece he set a time piece when the Lord Jesus was here he set a time piece he said observe look at the fig trees when summer is drawing nigh he would tell us this is our time piece because why there's only a short allotted time to the Gentiles it was the mystery that Paul would speak of this is only for an alloted period of time where he calls out a people for his name's sake he takes his church his bride his wife unto [Applause] himself to where eventually that as we were grafted in the Gentile days would be over right now Revelations 181 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven after these things what just took place Babylon right the falling everything now notice this after these things Revelation 17 even where H no I'm sorry Revelation 17 when it's speaking there of the sealing of the Servants of god notice verse two and he cried mightily I'm sorry after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory this is that same angel of Revelations 101 yes amen this is the holy ghost coming down in his fullness in this hour hallelujah amen it was after these things that Abraham now he Journeys to mount Mori after these things where God came down Abraham had heard him seen him in dreams lights Visions but now God came and took upon a vessel of Flesh amen is that right amen God came notice having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory watch this and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying well I wish you could preach that mightily this Bo listen this word it has no Mayes in it hallelujah amen this word has no well it might be or this word has no weakness in it amen the atonement has no weakness the Holy Ghost has no [Applause] weakness this is declaring the courage that God is bringing to the Church of the Living God and let me just announc it not is but has brought Hallelujah cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen he's fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird you know what it is her Doctrine has gathered the harlots to her it's the ecclesiastical system it's gathered Every Nation every government unto itself Hallelujah she don't want somebody in she gets them out right are you with me come on now don't be ignorant of this yes amen she'll even take her own people out to advance the cause but she can't do nothing right unless God permits it to be done amen amen amen she don't even have her own military but can call bombs down hallelujah amen you with me you see these are things they are being united together listen God there were mortal enemies in the days of the Lord Jesus pilate and Herod those guys hated one another they hated one another like brother Ram talked about you had the Pentecostals come on David dessus in them they come over and sit next to the pope oh it's such a spiritual thing right really if it was spiritual you'd recognize what God has said in his word hallelujah but you see what people deem spiritual is their feelings this is where the world is at now it's all based on emotion this is why God had to send the word and say your experience is not based on emotion it must be grounded in the word am CU some days you're going to feel saved other days you're not going to feel saved but you got to know the ground you're standing on this is the standard against the enemy's blood prise God see how the enemy's tactic in subtility to draw you out in Emotion right we are not walking by emotion we walk by [Applause] faith Hallelujah this is why we need the compass and guide and the authority and the strength of the voice of the Holy Ghost we want to make sure everything's cleared out God I don't want that voice to be deadened in my life when it says turn here I want it to turn amen yes hallelujah we're not ignorant of Satan's devices for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven are you with me come out of her my people come out of that Gathering that religious grouping that uniting that is a contrary to the word amen remember in the book of Isaiah and the spirit of God picks it up in Revelations they wanted to call this ah you know that this is a synagogue we are a gathering of God and the spirit of God said this is not my synagogue my Dwelling Place this is a synagogue of Satan amen amen I have not called for this assembly who has called for this assembly God calls for an assembly by his word his Spirit sounds out through the word to together the people to the word himself not to a church not to an idea not to a Creed that's powerless but he calls together under the blood there's where the power is there's where safety is hallelujah don't ever put your trust with your name on a book somewhere right if man can put it on then man can take it off but let where your name is wrote on the on God's book let that become a reality amen amen I heard another voice from heaven so he heard a voice crying strong voice this is the same strong voice in Revelations 5 I heard a strong Angel amen proclaiming worthy Hallelujah you wouldn't see amen and I heard another voice from heaven come out of her my people and ye be not partakers of her sin that you receive not her plagues we heard this voice brother Joy amen we heard this voice from Heaven God had a vessel brother Dave on Earth that he could sound that through you Lord hallelujah and brother brand picks that up he said what it is he said that angel messenger is so inclined with God to when he's speaking it's God speaking through him this is why we're not looking at a church we're looking unto Jesus we needed to know what we need to look at now if you're planning on being here in the tribulation go join the church but if you're looking at saying I want to leave here I want to be with him Hallelujah Glory I mean what lady what what real little lady she don't want to be she don't want to be married as far as after the proposal's been made in the engagement when it's really happened she's looking she's counting down the time right matter of oh my matter of fact her heart is already departed she's still there in body but their hearts are united in an invisible Union and pretty soon her body will catch up to the one her heart has been United with Glory [Applause] amen what are you following I'm following the voice of God it's in his bride amall I'm going to read these things he said when you see Israel putting forth its blood buds that's a great ins sign time is at hand when Israel becomes a nation she's a nation today we see all the things peace treaties and peace and all that the Bible says when they begin to Proclaim peace then cometh sudden destruction don't get you don't get caught in your peripheral stay focused amen hallelujah look at this but to we who look for Christ the second time it's an inside he's soon coming we see things fixing to happen depends on what you're looking at no one knew by the word of God there was coming a flood how many knows the Bible said in Hebrews 11 that Noah prepared an ark before God spoke to him before amen it had never rained upon the Earth right try to explain it he couldn't Noah himself was not motivated and inspired because he understood it it was inspiration that took a hold of his life as a matter of fact it was a paradox let me just put it to you plainly if you have want a man to build a house you wouldn't have hired Noah brother Samuel what are you saying he built an ark that wasn't his natural abilities amen he was a farmer right but God called him to do something that he couldn't rely on his own abilities God I'm not an engineer what about me same way with Moses talk talk to talk right Lord God said you're the one I want to carry my message cuz God didn't want formed words Hallelujah hall hallelujah amen he calls for a people that rely upon his [Applause] inspiration Hallelujah one of these mornings that inspiration is going to drop [Applause] paragraph 38 the church the bride that called out today knows that the coming of the Lord is at hand regardless of how much we've been able to go in and be able to progress and so forth splitting an atom sending a radar message to the moon and you read this next nine with me that y'all got it up there that means nothing to the believer brother Aaron I'm sure on your job there's some tools that maybe they've come up with maybe that has kind of helped your job out I know for your job you do accounting aren't you glad you don't have to worry about just with one of them what do they call them things where you oh yeah four beads five beads six beads aren't you glad it's more than just a calculator and a pencil and an eraser aren't you glad there's programs right so you got to check those programs those programs themselves they help you right there's advances there's advances even in Civilization that has helped us but it never never is to be something we become focused right be much easier to try to cut everything out but you need to have the Lord say Lord help me to reain amen help me to walk in a real balance that means nothing to the believer only a sign that the coming of the Lord is at hand we see Nations breaking and the Nations coming falling apart and the world coming apart and the church move coming apart then we are taught that we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved but as these things begin to happen the church binds itself together Tighter and Tighter by the word of God this is the admonition this is what the church does bind ourselves together tighter with the word of God you've heard it spoke right here I wasn't even the one standing here the past two services but we've been saying it all along stability and unstable times we are living right now in a situation in the nation it's a mess are you with me never before we see the the things that has taken place even since 1960 to this scale right this is why brother R when he would talk about that election he says we don't know who has won it but the focus was he said see there's no certainty in democracy what's the only thing that's certain a kingdom that cannot be moved Hallelujah this is our certainty when you see the things the things that are taking place and then you know we look at it but remember don't let your pereral catch you but stay focused say God help me to silence help me to put out all the peripheral let me stay focused Lord on you it really don't matter who they put in office it ain't going to hinder the program of God sure they might depending on who gets in things might come down on us things things will come around and everything else but you know what Satan can't stop the bride no sir he ain't going to turn the bride around the bride ain't going down brother you ain't going to close her up direct quote you ain't going to close her up she's going to be taken up you can't shut this work down this is not a work of man I'm talking about your life I'm talking about my life this is not the work of man you're God's work hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and the move is on for the Bri titer to that word why because the word is the only sure Place amen well I know when Thanksgiving gets here mama's going to have sweet potato pie Brother David I happen just think about that I've seen you man sweet potato pie I didn't mean to call out like that but man his mom makes a good one but I'm talking about something that's more sure than sweet potato pie Thanksgiving I'm talking about something that's more sure I'm talking about something that's a reality that you can put your foot on you see if you look at it correctly of even what has been going on in the nation you recognize let my focus be solely on the Lord hallelujah man I want to preach here but that doesn't mean that you're not mindful let me just let me drop this here because I have to Pastor I'm not an evangelist I just can't run that doesn't mean that you put your head in the sand that doesn't mean that you pretend like nothing's going on brother B still said I'm an American I still say I'm an American right if you despise that you got problems I'm an American all her shame or her glory right are you with me that means there's things that look even within the midst of it even there's things that to be to be aware of what's going on but that ain't my focus right sure there's little things I got to do there's things I got to do it sometimes I don't like doing it I don't like nothing that takes my mind away from meditating in the word of God right I mean nothing right I like to be with God just staying right there whether I'm there in my office even when I leave my my office still being in tune just waiting on him to drop and bring other parts together cuz you're seeking the mind of God in these Services amen sometimes the menial task insurance and other stuff like that nobody likes doing that right you know what I mean brother Greg these some of these times things we got to do you don't look forward and say oh man today is the day we go online and pay the bills Nobody Does that at least I don't think there are it's what we're focusing on right you see don't let it be your focus right how do you know what a person's focus is what do they talk about what becomes the center and theme of their talk everybody's looking for something paragraph 40 as a group of Believers today a together we want to fix our thoughts our principles and things upon the coming the Bible says in Hebrews 9:28 so Christ was offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him many were looking for him in the day when he came in his Humanity but but they weren't looking for him according to his word they had their ideas and they missed him he came in Simplicity standing right among them John said he's here now John said he's here now yet he had not been fully manifested but John said I'm so sure of the one that I met and what he told me he told it to me I'm looking he said he's right among you right now but then the day broke where John standing right there and John could say as he as here the Lord Jesus would begin to make his way through that Crow Cloud remember it was not Christian bookstore having a Halo having oh he had this Aurora about his head no not at all the Bible said he was a man acquainted with GED Charles no Beauty we should desire but when he came walking down there that day same one who spoke to John the same Pillar of Fire said speak say it declare it what was John doing resting Abraham's walking to the place that God had showed him what's he doing he's resting but about that Third Day the Bible says he lifted his eyes his eyes went from the plain to the mountain when you begin to see all these things come to pass lift up amen your head Hallelujah your Redemption draweth night for those that look for his coming shall he appear the second time without sin salvation let me have just about five more minutes Abraham just want to bring us to a place and we'll close Abraham was walking and expecting the supernatural to take place you see expectation it grows in our hearts Abraham brother Braham would say it like this he said Abraham kept himself in an atmosphere that he could recognize when those men came up walking they look like ordinary men how many men have come out that way this wasn't something like oh there's people that live in this area on the plains of mam oh they walked by there were people out there they passed by at different times but there was something different about these brother Bram said the reason Abraham recognized and Abraham did not say my lords he had the revelation of the godhead come on now right amen he knew who father son Holy Ghost is the same self person revealed the Redeemer above us redeeming coming down to be one of us and then coming back in us to reveal and manifest and Quicken redemption in our life same God he said my Lord capital L capital O capital r capital D he recognized behind that Veil who was there brother BR said he recognized it because he was kept himself in an atmosphere let you see why the devil wants to get you caught in the peripheral cuz you get out of the atmosphere right Joshua 1 speaks of staying in the right atmosphere am Psalms 1 speaks of staying in the right atmosphere amen oh brother the Samuel I wish I could just live here at this church why you can have something so much better you have something so much better we come here and together bring our licks of fire together but remember what what what is the Glorious atmosphere that you and I can live in the Paul said if we live in the spirit amen then let us also walk am in the spirit you see expectation itself it grows it should grow in our hearts becomes more positive more sure being focused in on that one promise and becoming one with the word see the miracle only became greater it's a rehearsal Abraham when he walk when he's walking here this day Abraham has been accumulating in his life see brother samel there's a lot of things Abraham could have accumulated I can read about it but those are things that Paul said I have learned we forget those things that are behind Abraham was walking in the word his vision his Focus didn't become it became more the peripheral was losing its whole he had a lot of peripher when he left the land of Shard brought his daddy with him right right brought his nephew with him a lot of peripheral perip what will they say I love my nephew that was a hard thing in Genesis 13 God knew it was so hard that God said I'm going to help I'm going to force a decision to where it shows the value of the word in your life are you with me God knows what he's doing God brought a decision brought a situation that Abraham made the choice of the word right separation it keeps on through Abraham's life it's focusing focusing think about I want you to think of this in Genesis 14 the Bible Abraham has just went down there took his trained servants and went down there and overtook all these kings that took over the king of Sodom and those other kings he went down there LED his trained servants and they whipped him and he recovered lot he comes back here's Abraham they didn't realize it this man's a king too he's a ruler too the word has brought him to a place of ruling are you with me he brought him into a place just like the word brings you into a place and in the midst of all these kings that are there Abraham ain't focused around on there let me see if I can get in good with this guy see if I can get in good with this guy good with this guy but here comes a test here comes a test imagine this a gold block here comes the king of Sodom Sodom OPP Abraham for all you would you have this and you got to discern whatever is being offered don't always call it this blessing I know this blessing is of god you better discern it right because what you might be calling a blessing might be trapped amen hello somebody you see he's offering him here Abraham here I want to thank you for all you've done I appreciate everything you've done you've done I tell you what Abraham you've done so much for this company you know I want to do I want to promote you to my rightand guy oh oh God is blessing me oh God is blessing me and then inside the package it says you'll never be able to come to church your mind will never be free to think on me see sometimes it's a simple little things this is why we need discernment amen don't call everything that seems good good that's right that's right there's only one that's good and that is God we only want to accept that amen which comes from God because whatever comes from God remember what he said Genesis 12:1 I will bless you and you will beess and Abraham told the king of Sodom I don't want he said I won't even take shoeless right I won't even take something that even would seem Minister you know why Abraham's purpose was not for re his objective his motive was for his Fallen and all of that he was tempted come face to face he focused there when he when that was focused out in the midst all of these Kings think of these all this that was going on these Kings in their groups and my oh my well I thought we was a goner I thought we was this but in the midst of all of that he slips right in you do not recognize or do not read where the other kings stopped him or recognized him you do not read that the rest of them said oh here comes MDC yet he was the greatest King the Bible says in Hebrews 7 being first interpreted king of righteousness right are you with me this this mezc priest king and priest of that City who was it God God he would come down and make himself known right through the midst of Lady OA right through the midst of all the kings and riches was there in such a way but Abraham was so focused you see his objective in the beginning he's focused Here and Now from MZ brother Aaron he gives to him what's need bread he recognizes who mzc is he gives him a tenth of all a tenth of all time he recognizes who he is why don't he give that to the rest of the Kings this is speaking something so much different that tenth is to recognize who's the greatest king among yes the rest of them were Kings but this is the great king Hallelujah and he recognized it he gave a tenth what does that speak of the surrendering of our life he just don't want our mind he just don't want your body he just don't want your spirit he wants your soul that is the tenth and the tithe of the Lord when that gets brought into the storehouse of the Lord in him by the Holy Ghost there's a quickening and the rest of your life becomes an offering Hallelujah you want the en ties and offerings you want to offer the rest of your life amen you freely give it you could take this direction you could take that attitude you could let this build up but you offer it up Lord I don't want that in I don't want that in M let's just stop Supernatural say to you this morning we're living there's no doubt we're living in the closing of time now if that scares you then you need you need to get ready to go right so because we are to live in a place of being ready at all times because there's not one person here I don't care how old you are or how young nobody is promised tomorrow I don't care what kind of bill of health you got nobody's promis tomorrow let me just say it to you like this why wouldn't you want to live your life and that his life would be lived through you there's not one of us in here it's not brother Samuel can live this Christian Life it takes Christ to come he's the one that had to change my nature oh I tried tried TR youth camps go for a little bit fall off the wagon you know why that was my efforts I needed him to come but you realize what what kept him away me my trying you're trying you're trying to serve him kept you away kept him away yeah because it was my efforts but once it come to a place where I become dead Abraham could father children to a certain place but then the Bible says Not only was Sarah's wom did his stream of Life DED that was when the miracle see God Satan wants to complish God makes it so simple not only is that of the new birth very simple it's a surrendering and a consecrating of our life remember what we read here under inspiration it's letting him focus our lives into them let the peripheral let everything else will so and so might say this or say let that be focused out just focus it into the word of what the word is calling you with that in our life with that new birth there comes a focus in our life it comes a part in our life as we see with Abraham this was not just a this is not a story it's a prophecy it's a journeying in our life chapters that are in our life Abraham could have never walked to Mount Mariah in Genesis 22 if he had not accepted Grace all the way change you understand he's walking to mount Mariah with the supernatural every time he looks over at Isaac God's fa keeps walking comes over and maybe just grabs his hand squeezes eyes again come around again they just get over there and just hug Isaac and know brother he'll get over again squeeze his hand I saying I love you too Dad I love you too but Abraham what Abraham is doing he's encouraging S as he's walking to Mountain Fire what's he encouraging himself in the word the supernatural working of God that he knows this is not my imagination this is not what I've imagined this is tangible this is substance Supernatural he's looking superal so let all of our let the per tasks that we have to do we we we stated that but yet don't let the task become your focus but let your declaration be I'm a pilgrim I'm a stranger Hallelujah that's how I'm living my life I'm just passing through my focus is on him my focus is on his coming my f focus is on the Rapture just like you you sisters you have to think about at times whether you want to or not you got to plan at your grocery list you see what I'm saying little simple things you have to think about what are we going to have for this or what are we going to do for there what are we going to do for and things you have to think about but you see those are things and cares in this life remember what Jesus said to to Martha I believe it is or Mary whichever one it was you understand you're so cumbered with things don't become cumbered sure you have to do certain things sure at times you're going to have to put pain on your walls sure you know Brothers sometimes we have to repair certain things in our house but it doesn't become our Focus let our Focus be on him Simplicity of just staying in that atmosphere let's father Lord I I just just so thankful God for your mercy Lord we are nothing without you if it wasn't for you Lord he would pass right by us it wasn't us recognizing the reality of Lord It's you coming and inspiring us to recognize you think how your Prophet put it so simple he said it's God in you believing his own word oh God help us Lord father no matter where Lord a person might be this morning Lord I pray that if the enemy has so complicated things in their life maybe it's things Lord that your God is just so complicating as though that it's things that well they've got to do and I got to stop this and I got to may they Lord just see through your word you are focusing them into you and as the scripture would admonish us laying aside weight lay aside every sin that does let easily beset us let us run this race with patience looking you can't run a race looking at your feet you can't run a race looking at the sidelines you can't run a race looking behind you you run it looking unto Jesus Look to Him focused into a reality that would call you into a place of a real adopted son and daughter of and if you're there this morning you have that ground to stand [Music] on and let let your life let it remain focused things will come to try to distract maybe things come to try to dull emotions and other types of things will come but remember Abraham himself was not a person who was a superhuman being he was a man subject to like passions such as we are but Abraham focused his life by the word into the program of God that [Music] hour I wonder if we just couldn't say Lord I want to stay attracted Lord I want to stay focused upon you I don't want to be distracted I don't want the peripheral Lord to catch me and I start looking at this I start looking at that caught up with this or caught C up with that we realize that imperfection itself it isn't that we won't be tempted it isn't that we aren't pulled sometimes the things that we deem as the strengths in our life are the greatest hindrances to us but this is where we need the Lord when it comes say Lord help me I want to live in that atmosphere Lord I want to live in that that atmosphere we want to walk like Abraham what God had spoke to him he walked toward that place until his faith became sight is that your desire this morning Lord I want to stay focused that's my heart's desire I want to stay focused there's enough distractions there's distractions all around life even cares listen brother and sister even cares of life things that are not even sin not even sin but can begin to take our Focus say Lord help me to be focused you know when you're focused you've got peace I'm not talking about worldly peace I'm talking about I'm talking about Godly peace when you're focused you've got patience you'll find your patience is where it needs to be when you're focused like that you find love is right where it needs to be longsuffering gentleness me all that's because we're drawing from the source and the object of our life Lord God grant it I pray this is my heart's desire Lord help me God by your grace Lord as your Prophet would give counsel and power transformation when he would speak Lord to Leo and Jean talk about the work that was going on in that little trailer park and he saidoh it takes the leading of the Holy Ghost to keep a group of people in Harmony and holy to the message that God has given us lord I can't do this I need you I need you help me Lord I pray that in everything Lord God that this church Lord stays focused Lord I can't focus everybody I Lord God I know if I try that Lord I would be wasting my energy but I'm not the one who can focus it's you that comes and focuses the word so help me as that's my desire is that our lives would be so focused in oh God help me help me Lord I pray I don't want one to miss it Lord I don't want him to miss this day of visitation I don't want him to miss Lord God the Seal of God the Holy Ghost what it means Lord to be sealed away in that place of rest and peace oh God I pray Heavenly Father help us Lord Lord Jesus one of these morning mornings Lord I'm looking forward to it I'm looking forward when that sweep comes over [Music] us it'll be an
