in the house of the Lord this morning amen so good to see each and every one of you and you know we're living we're in a time of the year in the season where vacations in those times and so we always want to pray for one another and knowing those times that we can have to get away with family and so forth so I heard different requests of different ones traveling and so we want to just remember each one in prayer amen so so good to be amen together am amen hallelujah I don't know about you but even the little things I was thankful for the rain yeah I was I was thankful for the rain today and uh I thought I was hearing things you know I I checked those things and I thought there was absolutely nothing when I went to bed last night and but rain came but you know I I just asked Lord May the rain just fall here this morning amen amen you know you might have looked and felt like on your radar and it may feel like that uh there's no chance of it well if it was up to us we it's not us that brings the rain right amen he the Bible said he would come to us as the rain that's right so his coming is as the rain and God knows what you and I what we have need of and amen we're not the ones who make that happen but I want to be in a place to receive it amen and just to just to absorb it so amen we want to also uh just welcome uh different ones here uh so glad to have uh brother Matt and sister Heidi and I they're here for some reason but uh but we're so glad to have them here and uh amen and sister Michelle God bless you good to have you here with us this morning and uh Lord I think each of you your smiles have got broader but um amen it's good to be here we're going to have a a dedicate little Brooks to the Lord amen and what wonderful time also want to say it's good to have brother Bob right here with us this morning God bless you brother Bob good to have you amen sister ogga God bless you amen am good to have you here with us amen amen hallelujah amen so I want to read a a scripture before I we have them to come and uh it's out of Matthew chapter 19 and verse 13 very familiar uh portion of scripture but the the Bible says then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them but Jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven and he laid his hands on them and departed F I think that's the desire of every one of us as parents is that God has entrusted us with the life or lives that he's given us but by placing them back into his hands Lord you're the one who knows the whole order of their life you know the plan just like when God came and spoke to Samson's parents and I thought it was just to me as always that that partion has always been something that stood out to me to where that when monoa told his wife asked the angel to come again and when he came remember asked ask him to come again and when he came I thought of how that manoah asked him he says show us of how we're to order the lad's life because God's got a purpose that's good we're not here and we realize within our lives it's not just something haphazard we're doing even as we dedicate little Brooks to the Lord you know that's a that's a real solemn commitment when we do when we dedicate a baby that's just not that's just not something we do that well that's just part of what they do at this church or what that that's not it at all it's a it's an actual just like when a person is baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that ain't just something we do it's scriptural they never one time in the scriptures ever ever sprinkled an infant this is the scripture he had they put him they put the baby into his hands they they they committed it to his hands so we're not we're making a declaration that God with everything that is within me as you've given this life then I've entrusting it back to you and with all that is within me as I stand to dedicate this baby to you I dedicate myself aresh that in everything that your will would be done that in every area that the word itself would be followed in order for this promise to take in effect you believe that amen amen I think of when Joseph he brought Ephraim and Manasseh it's all scripture amen he brought them there to Israel praise God and you remember what happened when he put the the the firstborn on the right hand and he put there of the second on the left but God when he brought him the hands were crossed remember Joseph said no no dad you you got it you got it wrong but Jacob told him and said I didn't do this Glory God has done this you see it was through the cross the blessing has come to you and I amen what was what was intended for the Jews and they're going to get their visitation they're they're going to receive that revelation of what Calvary has meant to them they're going to receive the revelation of the true Lamb of God they're going to receive their their visitation it's it's on the way it's very imminent but to think I love how Joseph said it he said the angel that Redeem Me redeem The Lads also Hallelujah the same one that has done the work that delivered that's good me that's right deliver them amen and that the name of God be blessed through their life lives I can think of no greater thing when we stand here to dedicate little Brooks any child to the Lord amen there's no greater thing and no greater witness we can do than to put the life into the hands of God amen amen aren't you thankful that God's watching over he's watched over your life he's watched over my life he's brought us right to where we're at right now it's not by chance that you're here God has so ordered and even how that you are the Bible said fearfully and wonderfully made God's made you the way he has for a purpose and now only thing we have to do is just yield to him he's the one that'll operate through all of that through our lives God don't want us to all be the same he's made us unique in a certain way to get a certain thing that his glory might flow through our lives amen so as we dedicate little Brooks to the Lord I'd like to invite even the grandparents if they' come on up and amen maybe even amen even the siblings amen they'd like to come amen go ahead and sing it for [Music] us them in bring them in the of sleeping good [Music] in thank you wake uping the little on to Jesus so bring that c little guy bring bring from the [Music] one so what do y'all think about him perfect oh I tell you he's a real cutie yes he my goodness some he's he's sleeping peacefully somehow I seem to have that effect amen could we just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father what an awesome moment this is Lord God as you have brought this Union together Lord Brother Shane and sister Lily God how you are named in a certain time in an appointed moment their paths would cross and then God their hearts would be knitted together with love you would bring forth Lord from this marriage Union Lord fruit Lord God father this precious little life that we hold in our hands Lord Lord little Brooks Lord is you have given this life Lord You've entrusted it Lord to brother Shane and sister Lily God how thankful we are that we're not left to our own devices Lord God to try to figure everything out but I'm grateful that we have a heavenly father who's watching over us Lord who knows all about Lord little brookson in his life who's faithful God to give the leadership Lord through Lord father and mother Lord God the influences through grandparents Lord that in everything oh God that it might be to the glory of God lord as we Lord take Lord and at this moment Lord to dedicate his life back to you we want to say thank you Lord God for his life Lord we thank you Lord God for the Lord the settl and assurance that we have that you will lead and guide Lord in all things Lord may I pray God out of his life Lord may it always stay tender may it always stay God tender to you and to your presence Lord granted may he know you Lord I pray God may his life be Raised To Your Glory we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen he woke up there for a minute and I think he realized oh I'm in this guy's arms it's it's all right oh I tell you he's precious God bless you all God bless you God bless you so proud of you guys amen sister Michelle God bless you God bless you God bless you Sister Heidi God bless you thank you all now you know who had something to do with that that that don't take a lot of discernment right there that's right they have to ask sister Michelle they may have replaced all the pictures in their house put them to the certain frame size amen amen God bless you this morning I before I have you stand I just want to make just a real quick announcement and um just want to offer um our apologies for the delay of the Sunday school class getting started and I certainly appreciate sister Lily she has been so faithful for the last few years of um just um doing being there with the Sunday school kids the things the projects and all that they have done and just to be there with them and we certainly understand the duties that she has now so um but Lord willing that's going to resume uh not sister Lily but uh other sisters there it will resume on July 7th at 10:45 a.m. so we want to just say thank you sister Lily amen and uh for all that that was [Applause] done let's stand and let's go to the word of the Lord and just want to say I I thank you for our prayers and we had just some time just to rest and just to do nothing uh I'm not really one I don't really like myself Vacations or when you come back and you realize you've run here and run there now that's just me I you know there might be a little something to see but I I don't it was just good just to sit and uh just drink coffee and just to rest so I just appreciate uh that and then I I understood um when brother Brandon I haven't got a chance to listen to it all but I thought my this is different he's preaching on job but just just I I want to listen to all of it but what a what a wonderful uh service and I really um I really appreciate brother Brandon coming and taking the service here um I I was didn't just you know even when I have someone to come I don't just have people to come um I I want I want hearts and lives that have been a blessing to the people and what I have on my heart and um brother Brandon he I think he shared with you he's been through quite a journey um it was quite a journey and I had told him throughout the times I kept letting him know we're praying for you we're standing with you and that's been quite quite a journey but we thank God for his faithfulness and I thought it was just wonderful that uh brother Brandon to be able to stand here and to share that um with us let's go to we have Proverbs Chapter 20 I don't know if I told you that but I want to go back in here and I want to speak on the family here once again this morning and I'd like to continue the thought if God will help us um try to you can never really bring anything to a close but I want to just try to capitalize upon that here this morning in Proverbs chapter 20 and verse 5 counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out most men will Proclaim everyone his goodness but a faithful man who can find the just man walketh in his integrity and his children are blessed after him I I want you to notice that verse the just man walketh in his Integrity his children are blessed after him and then in verse 29 the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is the gray head and so we just want to look here once again this morning at that on Great Men of God man we just let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer and maybe you have a request on your heart God knows amen I know there's been many requests for different needs and healing but whatever the need is let's just commit it to the Lord in prayer and let's just invite him to come Heavenly Father Lord we are so thankful for your mercy Lord with us once again Lord we're grateful Lord that we have a place that we can come and we can gather Lord in the word of God and Lord we're just Lord looking to you that you would just come Among Us and very special way this morning once again lord it's where we look to you it's not anything Lord that we are trying to do or create father but we just Lord desire to so yield Lord of our lives and our hearts to you and father that God you would just speak to us Lord in a way that would be fitting Lord father to the present needs and ministering to our lives Lord you know every Lord every heart Lord and father we certainly believe that God the word of God holds within it father oh God the power Lord to transform Lord so father may your presence just come Among Us Lord and take Lord under your control every situation Lord father we give our thoughts to you we give all that we are to you Lord that you might have your way father Lord in our midst Lord and God when it's all said and done May me be able to say that it was good to be Lord here in the Pres presence of God and that our lives have been affected and influenced Lord by the glory of God we commit Lord this day Lord in this Lord's service into your hands now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated I I want to read just a portion in looking at this on uh Great Men of God and I want to look at a portion here where we read just to kind of get our thoughts in out of a Psalm of Life and you're aware that brother Branham would refer to this Psalm of Life over and over as a matter of fact brother brand said it was it was his favorite and um it's something that was written back clear back in the uh later 1800s by Henry wodsworth Longfellow but it deals with that of a of a real purpose and a direction that would be given to that of a young man and I'm not going to uh read NE necessarily all of it but I'm going to read uh just parts of it I'd like to begin if I could Those whom Brianna's on the slides I'd like to begin at I think it's the fifth stanza it says in the world's broad field of battle and uh you know before that all the the previous stanzas here uh um Longfellow is putting forth that there's a purpose in life and that's something that should be the desire of every of every young person and those things some sometimes in a in a time in a day that we're living in and it's not there are certain things that are peculiar to the day that we're living in where we have to be uh be in such a place to where that Satan let me say it this way Satan is no longer operating in just a subtle disguised way he's out in the open um the word of God has taken the covering off of him but it's in such a time in this hour that where Satan is moving in such a way that I believe it's an hour that we are to be as the children of God very intentional in the things that we're doing and so when we look at this purpose that that as a young man or that in any of our Lives it should always be of a purpose that what God what purpose do you have for my life Lord the reason that you have saved me and Raised Me Up and and brought me to where I am and Longfellow starts in with this in the world's broad field of battle in the ABC of Life be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in The Strife trust no future however pleasant and let the dead past bury its dead act in the living present heart within and God overhead lives of Great Men all remind us that we can make our lives Sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing over life solom man a forlorn and shipwreck brother seeing shall take heart again let us then be up and doing with a heart for any faint still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait I I think those are just beautiful words I I could stand behind the the prophet of God and say that's abs absolutely those are wonderful words and a direction that is given that God would bring to make known his purpose to us and bring discernment in our lives if there's one thing that we must have in this life we must have discernment and I'll tell you in order to have discernment I'm talking about something that's greater than our mental abilities because there you can have discernment within your reasonings and knowing this is this to do this and not to do that but it's going to take more than just our ability to reason it will take a discernment that is comes by the spirit of God that's why Paul could write in the book of Hebrews and say strong meat belong it to them that are full age who have their senses exercise to discern good from Evil because we're living in a day and age that CS good evil and evil good we're living in an hour that was prophesied where it's a time and an age and and it's not people it's the spirits that have come in to this generation just like it was in the days of Noah the Bible said that the Earth was filled with violence through them there were individuals that became channels or portals that came under the influence of those evil spirits and all of that began to be manifested upon the Earth but there was also a man by the name of Noah and he himself became a channel that righteousness might be displayed upon the Earth and so God has always had a witness he's always had a standard that he can raise as the Bible said when the enemy would come in like a flood God will raise a standard against it how does God raise his standard what is God's standard his standard is his word how does God make his word sure well he spoke it in the beginning but then that word itself God came and he manifested that word that he already spoke that that's what the coming of the Lord Jesus was he was a manifestation of the word that had been spoken clear from the Garden of Eden that I will give thee a seed and it shall bruise the head of the serpent and all the other Messianic promises that were that were made and that were given and then that word became the living standard inside of a group of people when the Holy Ghost was poured out it became the word living itself inside of the people that's how God makes it sure he has raised it the prophet said three times already there's no way no greater way for God to make his word more sure in your life than by the Holy Spirit God's word coming into your life and then your life through your life it becomes a standard the word itself is actually manifested so when we look at this we need that discernment of the Holy Spirit within this hour we're not made to be as dumb driven cattle we're not made to go along with everything of the world and come under the influences of the world but we are are set apart by God and what God has called you and I to there's a purpose that burns in our heart so when I'm looking at this here on a great man and great men of God that we recognize that in the book of ecclesiast is verse one of chapter 7 it says a good name is better than precious ointment now now we understand you know I remember when I taught school you know there would be things that we would have things on the list and you would have names on the list and sometimes I didn't recognize the first name but I knew the surname cuz I'd already had enough of maybe that family in my class I already and I would want to know how is the connection with this particular family is this connected with this same you know uh a grouping because I we' already had dealings and I knew you know kind of the way things were come once in a while you'd be shocked you might get a sweet one you know that would come your way but you know there would be things like that you could hear a person's name and they might say a certain thing and I think I shared this with you before when Paul when when God brought Paul along I had already uh declared I said I I want to name him James the want to name after you know after my dad and and then the middle name to be Paul but it happened that year I had a boy named James in our class that guy was a thief and a liar I mean I'm telling you he could steal you blind I'm I'm serious it it wasn't anything where you just look at and say oh oh I I know I I caught you no this guy he was good at it I mean he he was good I don't know how his skills had been H had been honed in but it had come to such a place and what I'm trying to say is is that sometimes we can hear a name that is mentioned and we think oh my so what is the surname and then when we hear that Sur oh okay yeah thank goodness it's not it's not the James that I'm thinking about but you recognize because what we're talking about here is not just that name but it's what the character remember At The Mention Of that name that's why At The Mention Of The Name Of The Lord Jesus there is a character that is manifested to you it's not just a name but it is the character and the life that is spoken when we speak the name of Jesus Christ it is a character and this is why when the scripture would tell us it the good name a character is better than precious ointment this is why when the prophet would say God is searching for real man he said I don't mean how big his muscles are man is never judged by his muscles that's a brute man is judged by character I've seen man that weighed 200 lb and solid MUSC and didn't have an ounce of man in him and would throw a baby from a mother's arms and ravish her that's a brute but a man is measured by character and there never was a man like Jesus Christ the Bible said there was no Beauty we should desire him but a character like it has never been molded there were many great righteous men but none of them had the character that was needed or able to do what he alone could do they each had their part with the anointing of the spirit of God that come upon them and that part of the word that would be spoken and expressed out of their life but he came this character was came as a character from glory in Redemption it was none other than God himself come down to produce to you and I a blood that could take care of the sin question and deposit in our life what was needed in order to bring a change in our life to where our lives would display the very character of God himself you see you are ordained for this it is the spirit of God that pulls upon your heart and stirs your life this is why that friends it calls you an i to say Lord I I I want to be like you Lord I I desire Lord there's a yearning that begins to move in your heart because there's something in you that is being drawn upon by the spirit of the Living God this is why when we look at and in the scriptures and and we see that even where Daniel or David would express it like this and he would say help Lord For The Godly Man ceaseth for the faithful fail from among the children of men and to think help Lord The Godly are ceasing and and the Faithful Men are failing let me say this to you remember job was looking for one and job was saying oh that I might come before his seat oh oh that I could go to his door and then that inspiration would break that there would be one who would be able to show unto man his uprightness you say to show unto man his uprightness there's got to come one who's able to tell you who you are and who you always were and to what God has called you to and this is where that God himself came down and he displayed in the body of Jesus Christ the uprightness that he is calling man to he displayed it in portion through the prophets but then through and by the Lord Jesus Christ he displayed that uprightness and here in the end time the Holy Spirit has come once again in its fullness to display to men and women that you and I are Sons and Daughters of God we're not just trotten down something we were ordained before the foundation of the world it's not a church that makes us a Christian it's not the building that makes us a Christian but we are made a Christian by the spirit of Christ and this is why the Bible said in the book of Galatians because ye are Sons he hath sent forth his Spirit into your hearts it was not you or me looking for God it was God that came looking for you and me he knew about us knew the age he placed Us in and God sent a word that was ordained to get your attention because you are a part of this word oh I'm glad that God gives help so as we were wrapping that up last week I I told you I made a statement here and I want to I want to just work with that a moment that great men when we look upon it they're not born Great Men but they become they become great men remember the Bible said as many as received him to them he gave the power and that word power is exusia or the authority to become the sons of God see God ministers to you your right of ausia your right that you might go to dunamus which is the power to bring to pass that right this is why when God makes known to your heart and there's a hunger for the Holy Ghost a hunger for healing a hunger for deliverance let me tell you something when you can respond upon that you can go ahead and begin to rejoice and thank God and welcome God to fulfill that promise in your life because why a right has been ministered to you and you've got a right to the god to come and enforce that right in your life so great are not born Great Men you can have you can have individuals that you know they can be born to Great Men Great Men I'm speaking of when I'm talking of this phrase and even the title as we were looking at last week great men are men of character Yes Men of character and I want to just say it like this that what what makes within that of a great man here becoming a man that is is born and becoming a great man is because of the promise that they hold remember in the Scriptures it would Express of how that job was the greatest man in all the earth now job had a lot of wealth it would talk about or the greatest man in the East it was dealing with not only his substance but I want you to notice where that is mentioned that very that very term is not mentioned in the opening scripture of job the opening scripture is God's Declaration of who job is he's a perfect and upright man he's one that a Feth God and esth shuns evil you see he was one who was living by what God had revealed to him through and by the burnt offering then everything else like the scripture said seek ye first the kingdom of God and all of and his righteousness and all these other things will be added into you job was a great man but the greatness of that was within his life was because of what the revelation of his sacrifice had done in his life I I wish I had time to preach this uh within this but you recognize that that Ministry within job and you know as you go ahead study in the head chapters job there was a Ministry a character in his life there was a character that had power to bring Deliverance to bring understanding handing to those who were in places of confusion that's what it says in job 29 it was those that maybe that were blind their eyes would be open those who were even in the jaws of death they were snatched out of there it was a Ministry of power and deliverance what brought that about it was the character of Christ being revealed in job's life oh my Hallelujah so with the greatness when we think about Abraham you know brother would take that and make that statement of how that Abraham was the greatest man on the face of the earth now I'm not talking about because with that Abraham within his own flesh was great but it's because of the promise he had received and who had made the promise to him it begin to have an effect on Abraham's life is that right Abraham left in Genesis 11 he left the her of CIS not fully separated here he was with lot and his Grand his and his daddy with with him but he kept on walking with God Genesis 12 Genesis 13 he kept walking and we find in Genesis 14 here one who is greater actually blesses Abraham who has the promise and here Abraham being the greatest man on the earth what made Abraham the greatest man on the earth because he had received the greatest promise from the great almighty God and that's the thing that separate Ates you and I it's not because of who we are our DNA let me just say it like this it's not even because you come to this church it's because of the promise that you hold in your life it's not our association around the message it is because of the promise you hold in your life that will influence you to make the decisions in your life even the tough decisions that God has to arrange conditions that'll force you to to make decisions I tell you one thing as parents if there's anything that we ought to be able to do is stand behind and God dealing with our our children in such a way like David I read that scripture to you rid us from the hand of strange of strange you know strange women and yield take us away from falsehood Lord I want my home and my family to be under the influence of the Holy Spirit and I want to encourage when my children when there are things that they come do in their life to say Dad God is leading me to lay this aside or to move right here I want to be able to stand there with the word of God and encourage him and say let's pray about it and because why God is dealing with him on a personal way and that same God that's dealing with them in a very simple thing that we could look at it'll be the same way the rest of their life Hallelujah this is why even when a young person can come and you know brother Samuel whether here or wherever God's dealing with me on on certain things let's pray about it and let's ask God as God is opening that to your heart let's ask God just so confirm that and settle it in your heart to where the decision that you make is a decision you realize things you're seeing and now it's completely under the influence and there's a settl Hallelujah think about where Abraham came to in his life Abraham came to a place all all the way through the Journey the decisions that he made in life was because of the promise he was holding Abraham did not look at lot as though that he himself was better but he looked it was the promise that he held that he made the decisions he made and see that's a great man that's a great man of God the decisions that are based upon what the promise that we have let me tell you we're we're in the season of rapture we're in the season of change we're in the season of influences and things and listen I I could go through and give you accounts in the scripture to where that there are things and influences and decisions that were made like even Jacob one time made a decision to leave bethl right after God had dealt with him and made a decision to leave bethl and go on down here I can't remember the name of the city now he goes on down there and you know what happens to his daughter his daughter that here becomes one of the city that begins to lust after her and now the situation that comes and ask her you know to to marry him and remember it's always been the Declaration God himself never approves of unbeliever or Believers marrying unbelievers let me just drop this in right now don't ever entertain one who is an unbeliever and think that you've got the ability to convert them there is nobody that can convert an unbeliever but God that's why when you know that you met God you know that God that changed your life you met the Supernatural and you don't ever want to get entangled with anything that God has not already put his approval on I'm not talking about for the F of relationship I'm talking about to where you see that God is with this life this is a life that loves the Lord this is a life that loves God this is a life that bears His Image amen come on that's still scripture friends hallelujah we're not interested in trying to make somebody conform to a group of ideas that'll work for so long that's right man we're just going to run with it it'll work for just so long go along for just so long but about that it ought to be that what we see and what we're searching for is to see Christ in that individual if I can't see Christ in that individual then sorry I want Christ it's him and him alone I don't want on anything else but Christ and anything that I add to my life it ought to be an adding to more of Christ in my life Hallelujah Oh Glory so we find that Abraham himself here he comes to such a place to where everything that is laid on the line to where he offers his all and because of that offering God expresses that thy seed shall possess the gates of thine enemy me in Genesis 22 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice amen that's real greatness you know what greatness it's obedience to the voice of God that's what it is so because when we look at thoughts of and and reasonings of greatness you know that remember what the world calls great God calls foolish is that the scripture what man calls great oh this is so great you know man even in his even in uh how man would look at it man could look upon things and you know they'll look at at what they call Great this is what happened when God come to fulfill his word even through the life and Ministry of John the Baptist they were looking for the Low Places to be made High and the high places to be made low but they weren't in tune with the spirit of God and they were looking for something that matched their reasoning and when John came he came according to the scripture he came according to how that God had spoken it but it wasn't talking about something out here in the natural but it was God coming down to make a way in the heart of the believer that Christ himself might come and take his Abode in our lives but you see their way of looking at greatness it took them right away from the real principle and kernel of the scripture and that's real humility you see when the Lord Jesus when he came he's the greatest man to ever live and when he came upon the Earth remember he was asked who would be the greatest as a matter of fact the Bible will say in one place there was Strife among them in another place it says there was disputing when it's talking of the same account so you recognize that that this voling for position and this that that part it laid within man that came because of the fall of the first birth you you realize it takes the grace of God for you and I to lay down our life that that's what the scripture said except a man be willing to lose his life or Surrender it if he's not willing to surrender it if he keeps his life he'll lose it in the end but God is so placed it that he's not going to come and overpower you and I to take it from us but he wants us to come into such a place that it's a surrender to his presence we see the greatness of God and God's greatness is one who's able to condescend if he would have remained where he was PR there would have been no hope for you and I but God condescended to such a place that he didn't even have a pillow to rest his head on did not even have a home is that right had no place he said the foxes have holes they have dens but the son of man has no place to lay his head it come to such a place and God so condescended even to where we see the woman at the well we see many different needs to where that almighty God condescended in such a manner in order to bring Deliverance to bring Redemption to Fallen man now notice with this of the strife and he would say the greatest one among you is he that would be able to humble himself the greatest one among you because when we when we understand that that brother R would say it like this great men in the message unwelcome Christ great men are little men they never brag or take honor they make you feel that you're great that's great men and he said here's the greatest of men the greatest of all men God manifested in flesh become a footwash flunky with humility the king of all eternity all glory the creator of heavens and earth washed the dung off of men's feet yes he did and this is to me what strikes me it was already humiliation enough that he became one of us took upon himself the likeness of sinful flesh that was already humiliation but here in the midst of his disciples he humbled himself and washed their feet he took the the lowest position you see what the spirit of God will always lead you and I to do is to take the lower position you say lower to what it will always lead us in subjection to the word let me just say this to you when Jesus knelt down and he began to wash their feet remember what Peter said you're not going to wash my feet Lord he he looked at it hey you you you you you you've so in such a position no I'm not going to let you wash my feet it wasn't that he had anything against Jesus it was simply of the place that Jesus had so condescended to that Peter was looking at it in such a natural way and Jesus told him what I'm doing right now you don't understand but you will understand it you're going to come to this understanding and he said whosoever's feet I wash not has no part with me that changed everything Peter said if it me means that I'll have no part with you then wash everything Lord wash all of me is that right but he showed us the authority of what it is that when the word itself when we in our lives would come into such a place of subjection I don't care what the hardest obstacle is I don't care what the greatest thing that might be in your life it might be husband wife it might be differences it might be things and so forth at work but listen when you in your own life can so subject yourself to the place of the word then you are letting the word go to work instead of your feelings your emotions your reasonings let me tell you something the word has power within it to bring to pass whatsoever that love has called for you've got to be sure that it's love that's in your heart love does not call for vengeance love does not call for Retribution love keeps no record am is that right that's love are you hearing me it's there we could go all the way through that but what I'm saying is is notice the position that he that he assumed in order to bring to pass this in their lives I'm glad about that aren't you amen so here God's not you know he's not calling you know even in humility sometimes we can get in our mind that humility itself and you know is you know maybe a way that we would kind of make our face or how we walk but that that's not it it's some humility in our heart to the word of God there you go am and I just want to say it like this leadership itself leadership is not meant to be a struggle right it's not meant to be a struggle it's meant to be an Evidence of inward Victory that's what real leadership is that's good you see the lamb was willing to go to Calvary because he had already wrestled it out he was able to be led the lamb was able to be led right and there's a leadership itself it's not meant to be a struggle that this is why friends that when when many times that within the things of Life of how that God comes with his Spirit in order to bring about a real Divine change in our life it these are things that when we're looking at it it it ought not be that we're looking at the word of God as as well his Commandments oh is asking us to do this and and you know then we well the preacher is asking it it isn't the preacher God's word is still the same he's never changed man has wanted to take from God's word man has wanted to alter it but you know why man does that because they don't know God there should have been a bigger Amen on that the reason men will do that they know God by their Seminary or by a certain teaching but they don't know the Living God when you know the Living God and you have met him face to face you have met his character and there when you're reading the word then the word of God is not just a letter it now becomes a love letter there are things that are written between the scriptures and between the lines that are there and God's thoughts become so precious and impactual to your life hallu Hallelujah and I will say it like this as that leadership is not meant to be a struggle but evidence of an inward inward Victory we've got to be willing with a willingness to conquer ourselves I tell you what of all the greatest of all the latest greatest land grabs that's ever been the greatest Victory is when we're able to conquer ourselves you go there you go that's the greatest Victory yes sir that's why brother Brown would say and humble thyself and listen he's not taken away from worship when he says this but he says when a man has been able to conquer himself he has got more Victory than the man that would run all over the building and Shout man not talking taking away from from from from worship that's not what he's doing at all but he's letting us know that real overcoming power and victory is more than just being in the house of God it's more than just coming under the influence or coming under and oh my we have just a wonderful time in his presence thank God that we have a wonderful time in his presence but friends it's got to come something that we are real and we're looking at it the Lord I need a deeper work I don't want to just be satisfied with something on my spirit that leaves me when I get out of here and I'm back to the same old person again I want that which you drop in the depths of my soul that brings a change in my life that's what God promised that's why real leadership is the evidence of an inward Victory let me tell you God's called you to be a leader in the capacity that you are as a father as a mother you'll never be successful without full obedience to the word of God that's true let me give you an example if you can tell your son or daughter well that don't that don't apply anymore there'll come a time in their life they'll ask you well what about this problem what about this scripture you see you you got we want to seow seeds of righteousness we want to show that that God the Bible said in the Book of Malachi I'm God and I change not Hebrews 138 said I'm G Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he never changed he's the same God when he comes in he lives the same life through you and I right so in order there's got to come a full obedience uh uh which which brings the entitlement to the Token bringing God's life in us and then we've got to stay in our Lane right that's right father's got to stay in his Lane as husband mothers got to stay wife got to stay in her Lane true you see many times like brother brah would say it and he bring the scriptural principle seek you first the kingdom of God his righteousness all these other things will be unto you we see the woman of zapus we see all the way down through the scripture that every time there was a miracle and God moved it's because God's word was obeyed first and this is why that when we're we can be interested about brother B just says it like this in the Hebrew series he said instead of us trying to get everybody else lined up he said make sure that you're lined up with God's Will and when you're lined up with God's will then the rest of the family will'll fall in line you see that's believing what God has said to be true oh my I think there's no greater thing that we can have than to be a servant of God you know when the prophet himself remember they presented that I stood there in in brother bram's office a few years back and we stood there and we're standing there for for some time and I looked at the at at the picture that uh they gave him in the message restoration of the Bride tree that brother uh Jerry Stephy had painted and there it is and every all the writings and the accolades and what they were you expressing of how of what they had seen and and and you know there through brother bram's Ministry and and you know through through his life and and this is to me what strikes me is that after it's all said and done brother bham just says my he says I'm not worthy of those kind of things to be said he said but that means more to me than all the money in the world why because it's a character that the people have seen manifested before them and here's what he says he says just to think that somebody would regard you as a servant as God's servant what a high compliment to be regarded as a servant of God what a high compliment for you for me to be regarded as a son and daughter of God a servant of God there's no higher compliment that we could pay one another now notice this in Psalms 1 one2 verse one blessed is the man that fearth the Lord this isn't afraid of him but it's reverence that delighteth greatly in his Commandments that's so good his seed now notice the effect of this his seed shall be Mighty upon the Earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed now this word mighty when you look at this word it's a word Gabor when you look at it down through the scriptures there some of the very first parts of it of Mighty and this it's just many times what we can get in our mind of Mighty and some of those who regarded as mighty was based on their Earthly wisdom in the days of Noah there were men of renown they were Mighty Men of wisdom and knowledge then is that right mighty men that have lived down with knowledge but this Mighty is not talking about men of Earthly strength Earthly abilities Earthly standing it's speaking of the character within their life are you with me of how that through this well what brings this about is remember Great Men D not born Great Men that's right they become great men notice where it starts with blessed is the man that word blessed I wish I had time to preach that it deals with a man who is completely content in his walk with God that he knows that his life is matching what God has required there is a real happiness that's not brought by Wall Street or anything else it's a happiness where that man knows where he is with God in his walk with god notice the effect there is a reverence and a Delights in this commandment yes sir Hallelujah you see these are things that with within it this is why these are important princip principles that within this his seed shall be Mighty upon the earth and the generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endureth forever that's good so there's a there's a reverence that that that when we're looking at with great men there's a reverence there's something that that should come from that life that even when job would walk through the marketplaces then when it talked about princess would stand up it wasn't because that job you know had had some you know he had some kind of an ego trip that's not what it was at all it's because of the character in his life this man had a character that was brought he didn't even have the Holy Ghost like you and I have the privilege of having but he operated under the Revelation that God had given him in that day and just that portion of the Revelation It produced in job's life that kind of a character Hallelujah and that kind of a character within it it it brought a reverence this is why a reverence a life of humility and reverence oh the effect that it will have through our life it will bring forth the same life in others amen and I'll just say it like this Redemptive power lays in the heart of the believer yes that's good yes sir yes sir if you have been born again of the spirit of God God Redemptive power lays in your heart there is that which Paul writes of it is the spirit of reconciliation it is the spirit of God that of redemption but remember reconciliation can only operate through lives that have been fully reconciled to God and then when that life is fully reconciled to God then the spirit of reconciliation can operate through that life we become a channel that others can be reconciled to him let me just preach for a minute this is why then in your life how Satan wants to so come in your homes in your families he wants to get on you as a brother or sister and get your thoughts out here get you under the influence of the day get you into traps and things to try to break away that effect and that influence that Christ would have on your life and through your life and get us so tied up to where we are unable to even reconcile situations in our home let me tell you the way the way that Satan works is to try to break that influence but there is nothing that can ever reconcile a situation nothing outside of the spirit of almighty God are you hearing me friends listen friends I stand right here as a pastor I believe in laying hands on the sick I believe in casting out Devils but let me tell you something it is not just a preacher to stand there when that is done I believe with all my heart that no matter what it is that you might be troubled with here this morning I believe there's Deliverance in the house of God but you're going to have to keep and hold on to that Deliverance in your life you can't go out what do the scripture say go and sin no more go and disbelief no more don't leave and continue on the way that you were in other words do not make your life a Haven that is welcome for other spirits to come and influence your life but let the standard of the word be in your life that Satan does not feel welcome at all and you say how does that happen by the love of God and staying in the love of God there's a portion here in the scripture this man is not ever even alive when his daughters come to Moses and it's time for inheritance to be given out but it's zad this is this is the man's name he's not even alive in this time this man has had no Sons now to understand that what God gives to a tribe it always is to stay with that tribe it can never pass from this tribe to that tribe amen even if the land is sold the Bible says in Leviticus it shall not be sold forever hallah that's good oh my I wish we could preach on that but you understand that these portions of inheritance of land that here zelop had was not even alive and all he had was daughters but the daughters that he had came to Moses and this is the Declaration that they made to Moses in verse three our father died in the wilderness but he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora yeah right I tell you what a testimony they you know what it is they saw this they were Witnesses when the rest joined themselves to the spies those 10 spies that went over into the promised land and said it's an evil report they were Witnesses of how that their father stood with the word of the Lord how their fathers stood under all the Wailing and the pressure that was there they are aware of that because there was something in the heart of zad notice the effect that he stood in that time walking in his Integrity look at the effect that it had upon his daughters it brought a courage in his daughter to go and ask for a promise oh my to ask for something that it looked as though there's no hope for itah there was a courage in them that they rose up when there was no promise that of to daughters but it Rose in their hearts to go and ask Moses and say ask the Lord because our father did not yoke himself with a Disobedience of Kora Hallelujah but he died in his own sin meaning natural causes cuz death passed on all men and had no Sons why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he had no son give unto us therefore a possession unto the Brethren of our father Moses takes it to the Lord and says the daughters of zop had had well spoken you realize there's things that you that even how God has come and he has dealt with our life to where when it seemed that there was no hope there were things let me tell you something there's things sometimes that you can look at and say I don't seem like I can find a scripture that matches my situation maybe God wants to raise you as an example cuz he's still God you may not find the exact scripture find the exact chapter but what's important is to know the same God that is brought Deliverance in every situation time and time again they had a testimony this great man great man of God Hallelujah here was John I want to go to the scripture here how here was John at that time greatest man here he was baptizing in the River Jordan greatest man on Earth at that time he was the prophet of God but the greatest man on Earth notied what came in the waters was the word right and John introduced the word the Lamb of God he introduced the one who was promised and notice a great man of God the greatest man on the earth at that time and here the greatest man now here stands the Lord Jesus here stands the word made flesh and he's given the privilege to introduce him I tell you there's no greater privilege you and I could have is to be able to introduce Jesus Christ there's no greater privilege than to be a display of his Mercy see just as the word came to John you say well John was ordained to introduce the Lamb of God you are ordained as well to display the word you are ordained as well the word has come to you brother BR tells us in souls in prison now he said the word comes to the predestinated they are the heartbeat the word has come to you this is why when Philip went to find Nathaniel this is why when the word has come to your heart it's something that begins to strike your heart and stir your life there's a desire to tell others of the freedom that you have experienced in your own life Hallelujah so the spirit of Truth when it comes to us still working with that just a moment where great men are not born but they become great men the spirit of Truth Jesus had said in John 16:13 when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth thank you Jesus now notice when he is come he will guide you into all truth one of the greatest evidences of the Holy Ghost in your life is being able to say Amen to every word of God and that your life is directed into the word of God now it's not just you realize it's when we talk about saying Amen to the word of God we're not just talking about that what we can say out here but it's something within our heart that that's what God's looking at remember it's not the humility out here it's the humility on the inside is that right because you know it it's just like when we can look at it here in the scriptures he will lead and guide us into all truth this is the promise It's A Life That's directed into the truth for whatsoever he shall he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever ever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come remember even in the time of the disciples he spoke to them and said there are things I'd like to tell you right now but I can't yeah it's it's too hard to be understood right now but when he has come see there would have to come that time and the only way that these things would be able to be grasped it would take the same divine revelation but it would come after the Holy Ghost has come into their lives now you see God has ways of bringing you and I through different situations and training and and teaching and how that God works down through our lives let me let me just read this to you I don't think I put this on the screen but you know brother BR is talking about how the same spirit of God will move down through sons of God today he says the great holy spirit that was given at Pentecost is here tonight and thy children many are weary and worn and been pushed about all for their own good their teaching their child training to bring them up in the admiration of the Lord trials worth more than silver and gold but as it is written no chastisement is Pleasant for the time being but when finally that church becomes to have its training then they will become adopted Sons or placed Sons into the inherit inherent of God which shall inherit all things and be equal in the powers and blessings as a Son of God Brothers to him this is the effect of God leading you and I into all truth character itself you've heard it said over and over it's not a victory if character itself is a victory it's not a gift that's right right talking about Great Men of God talking about the people of God living down through Time character itself the Holy Ghost is the gift of God right but character is a victory and there can't be Victory without battles is that right now I'm going to tell you what gives you the strength is the promise you're holding when everything you face in life you've always got to come back to you'll always be defeated if you one time get off of those sacred Sands you always must come back to and remain on those sacred Sands that's your basis of victory in everything you face you say why because the sacred SS is the Holy Ghost the word inside of your life that's why that you are commissioned to bring everything to the word and say well I don't see this right now I don't understand it then don't make a move on it because anything that's not done in faith is unbelief is that right that's scripture so it must be by faith and the only thing that can bring Faith is the word of God and so God comes to you and I just like when a a dad you know would come uh to his sons and and uh and I I don't just say it because that that I have sons but you know I realize it has to take place even for mothers with their their daughters there's got to be a time of coming into a place of manhood and Womanhood and inauguration there's got to be an inaugurating of that there's got to come a moment where there's things in other words it's not just left to its own it's not just left to their own deves remember in the Bible says in the days of Judges every man did what was right in his own eyes it don't just say that once in there it says it multiple times that's right but you see God would come in a way to break that from you and I so we're not walking according to our own imagination but God would come and reveal his perfect will to you and I not because we deserve it not because we're better than somebody else but because God made a promise in this hour he would keep his word my notice the scripture says in 1 Corinthians 13 when that which is perfect has come then that which in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I become a man right I put away childish things right true there's things that no doubt every one of us in here there's things that you can think of of right now that where we thought that man you know we had it all figured out you our parents you know my they poor things you know man if they only knew and you get you know you get on and you realize that was wisdom yeah there was direction that was being given to my life a lot of times I didn't understand it I didn't understand why I didn't understand why no was said I didn't understand why certain things were done but you know what the thing that that that would bring that about is to be able to look back at that and realize if it hadn't been for God's grace if it hadn't been for his Mercy is that right and then things to where that Dad or Mom and they're they're coming around in our life and say hey hey come on now you're coming into a time there's responsibilities there's time to start taking up listen friends that's why we're living in the in in this time that we're living in we're still living in a situ ation we're individuals you've got grown men right that are still babies y you know why because they've not been initiated into manhood there's not been things that's been taken because remember great men are not born great that's right they become great but it's through the admonishing it's through the full counsel of God and it works to move away there's things that we be begin to realize it's time to let go of certain things this is how God deals with our lives as children of God that there's things that God begins to come around to our life and say hey it's time to let go of that you you you can't keep holding on to some of those same things you you can't keep walking in that same way it's time to mature it's time to come up the responsibility and the hour demands it watch out brother BR says this in what he is that Elijah he said I believe we have been children long enough God's going to turn his church into manhood now now who's going to do it God's going to do it we have played and frolicked as children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood and maturity Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child because he thought as a child but it's time that we begin to think like men and women now for we've got to get down to business oh my this is why let let me read another place here if God be with us where be all his miracles brother BR says you can't expect a baby to be born a man he's got to grow to it and we grow in Christ to the full stature not somebody gets converted tonight and tomorrow we go preach the gospel we grow up into manhood and into the stature of Christ amen see God remember remember the promise that he gave to Abraham the promise that you hold is what declares the greatness right in your life and that promise is what's there to influence the decisions you make yeah let me just say it like this I'm just sharing with you a little bit that even when there's times my boys can tell you and to get to be to a certain time some of the things that I would even lay in with them to let them know even when I'm correcting them and there are things that that would be done and and so forth I I'm letting them know someday you are going to be in charge and responsible for a household right and so this this right here the reason daddy is standing the way he's standing right now you may not understand it I don't expect you to understand it but here on what I'm giving you is by God's word but God is calling and God's desire desire is for you when you get to that place then you are prepared for that moment there's certain things that we are doing look even when God took the prophet through all of his life and all the testing all the trials remember listen when brother R him through the first pool when he remember he was trying to you know uh uh lace that that shoe that that shoelace through that through that that little shoe and and the angel had already told him don't do it don't try to explain these things even then under pressure he explained them right then here he is fishing in the second pool Under Pressure oh brother Ram's a great man oh brother Ram's a great man oh brother R's a great preacher pull it brother R boom he comes under that but it's different with the third pull hallu what I'm bringing you to is to show you this the prophet God never threw him away after the first pull that's good that's good as a matter of fact when you read it it goes from One Vision right into the next you know why because of the maturity God taking situations where mistakes were made listen God's not afraid of your mistakes but it's what you and I do with them don't make excuses for your mistakes don't make excuses for your shortcomings submit it to God and say God teach me Lord train me help me Lord Build Me Up Lord in this area of my life this is exactly what God was doing with the prophet throughout his life that's what God did with Abraham they were not born great men they became Great Men because of the greatness of the promise that was given by a great God and they submitted themselves to it so it blazs within our our hearts to bring that to bring that about amen within our within that even in our families it ought to be an encouragement this is why even within the ministry of a pastor it's one of out of all the five ministerial offices I don't say it because it's me it's just that's how it is it's one of the most closely related offices there to that of being of a father that of being like a husband because it's constant watching over and care right right right you don't have that with the Evangelist you don't have that with with the Apostle you don't have a all of them have their part is that right all of them have their part but how did God would so place it that care with the objective is that we grow in him that we're coming to moments and Times of decisions and things in our life to where it should be in our life we're looking and saying I'm no longer what I used to be right there's a desire in our life it it ought to be where the word of God is coming and stirring our hearts to Lord I want to be more like you amen God begins to deal with our life I mean you can ask my boys just like every one of us have experience sometimes when there were things that my dad brought across my my pathway and my turning and it wasn't just in the Natural Things of life but it was even when I first got to preaching let me tell you something my dad was not easy on me my dad when it came to preaching and Ministry he would shoot it straight with me on things he would tell me son you need to study this out a little more you need to look at this a little more and here's a book on this and here and you need to look on this and I you know maybe try to go nope he said nope you need to study this out when you get this studied out then come back and sit down and we'll talk about it oo that's stung wow that stung it really stung it cut but you know what it caused me to study yeah it caused me to study on many of those subjects and things but you know what it was doing it was bringing me to a place even of maturity even of surrendering of my heart in my life that God could mold me prise the lord it's the same for you and iise my my my thank you Jesus this is why let me just close with this when the Bible it speaks of how that in our lives as fathers and mothers that there's things that it would speak of how that fathers in the book of Colossians provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged there's things sometimes that as a father in the natural there's same Sometimes some things as a Pastor sometimes there's things that we all can see and you can be discouraged you can get frustrated but let me just tell you something let me just tell you one of the greatest litmus things for me when I look at if I feel the least little bit of frustration I realize I need to get more in prayer Glory I'm just sharing my heart with you I realize because that's that's Samuel even though there's a need there's a truth there's things that but you you realize because frustration will never bring results the only the greatest thing I can't get to it today but the greatest thing for you and I that we have access to is prayer if you can if we when we can enter into prayer for one another enter into prayer for our children enter into prayer for situations that we see when we can enter into prayer in the right way then we can expect to see God move we've got a right expectation prayer changes things sometimes there's things that you know we could say you know there's sometimes where you can say things you can say it until as the old southern expression says until you're blue in the face you can repeat it and repeat it and repeat it but once God drops that is that right like brother B said here you said you take a man that's heard salvation all his life and all of a sudden one day it drops hey he did it for me Calvary did it for me the spirit of God drops that in your heart and yet you've been hearing or heard about the story whether you're in church or out of church and all of a sudden it drops at that moment and you realize hey this is about me he did it for me Hallelujah that's the same way as God deals and he works with our life yes and he will work with our life Hallelujah until we get it amen let me tell you God doesn't leave you where he finds you that's right God doesn't leave you and I as a toddler he works with us neither does God take us as a toddler and try to make us a teenager all right God don't take a teenager and want to treat him like a toddler God don't take a teenager and put a teenager who's turned third 13 and man he can drive the co Gokarts real good God don't put keys in his hand God don't even put keys in the hand of someone who is 16 years old and legally can get their license I'm bringing that into the natural you understand that because you see what God does God will not he is interested not in you failing his word can't fail but God prepares you and I to handle what he's called us to he molds us that's why the testing and trial come our way it molds us it shapes us because what's happening in that trial it's reducing us from self that is so good and God is preparing us for what he's called us to that's right it's maturing yes sir it's what we choose to do with it within those times Lord I want to be more like you fathers discourage not your children lest they be angry unless they be all the air taken out of them right that's why in when we come down to it that's why brother brandham when he could say to the church there he would talk to us as pastors and ministers he said don't you tie your congregation into just one Bible evidence he said when you do that you keep your church in babyhood and not in manhood he said I could ask one Bible evidence and we'd all be embarrassed to raise our hands cry and sigh for the abomination of the wicked but you see it comes down to what is the real what is a real true evidence it's a heart where the spirit of Christ on the inside Bears witness with his Spirit praise the Lord that's so good this is why that when it all is said and done and I'm a Christian I I'm a Believer the the world and the rest is looking at what life that is seen reproduced that's why that within our life there's nothing that should be here that we live than a different life outside if there's a life if we live a different life outside then we don't have what's necessary and it's not that of what God intends for you and I to have listen friends when we God deals with our life and deals with our heart I'm not saying that to shame you but I'm saying it in this way that our lives should be such a desire that my desire is to reflect Jesus Christ I I I want to be one with him I I want to have a life that where others can say there goes a Christian not because I've said it remember the Bible said the faithful man does not Proclaim his goodness that's good his life speaks louder than all the words glory glory and those are great men of God those are great women of God because all the scre the scripture like I said last Sunday we could take the Ruth we could take the Esters we could take all of that it's lives that have been surrendered to almighty God amen let's just pray praise His name hallelujah thank you Jesus Heavenly Father Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord as the scripture is said in the Book of Psalms when David would Express that we are the Sheep of your pasture and he would say Lord that it is not us that has made ourselves but it is you that have made us Lord father I pray Lord that God through the portion Lord of these Services I know Lord here this morning even that God in the chopped up fragments Lord of everything I I just trust Lord that father what you have Lord desired to Lord speak to us and get across to our hearts the thought the thought that you have for us Lord that God that you find Lord in our lives you find hearts that are made willing lord lord it's you that is turning your church into manhood Lord you've come by your word in this day in this hour the promise that you have made and now you've come Lord and revealed it and Vindicated here we are our standing Lord many years later but how that the promise remains true remain sure it's steadfast now Lord I pray if there's one that would be here this morning that Lord under the sound of my [Music] voice that God that would have a desire within their heart to say Lord I want to know you in that way praise God I want to know you to where that you are the Lord Of My Life Lord you you're you're my master Lord you're my one who is there to control and direct my life I I don't want to try to handle it on my own I don't want to try to I don't want it in my hands any longer like like the little lad that had that Five Loaves and two fishes in his hands it would have remained just a little lunch that no doubt would have would have fed him but when he surrendered it into your hands it fed a multitude Hallelujah scriptures would tell us 5,000 but we realized that what was being counted was not women and children that was just men right but it it fed them in your hands now Lord here this morning I want May lives and hearts that would just look at it and say Lord I want my life so fully delivered into your hands amen I want that life inside of me the spirit that will bear witness with his spirit that I'm a Son of God I I want Lord that that everything in my life I don't want no hindrances I don't want anything Lord any unconfessed sin I I don't want anything build up in my life that would keep that Spirit of reconciliation from working in my life I want to be reconciled to every promise of God lord I want that word as Paul said that Ministry of reconciliation been committed unto us that Lord that that same life would work through US Lord you've spoke to us in these Services Lord that great men are not men of of stature physically it isn't by their smarts or their knowledge nothing wrong with all those things Lord they have their place but that's not what you're calling for Great Men great women of God lives that Lord A promise is spoke to their hearts takes a hold of their life and they begin to take a hold of that promise and it influences decisions they make associations and most importantly Lord because every decision will be about you and about this word in our life I pray that God that you would give strength give courage help every one of us Lord father if there's one here that doesn't know you in that way may this be a moment Lord I pray that Lord just the understanding that's needed is the understanding of of your presence cuz that's the real greatness Lord that's Among Us is your presence and to surrender to you that Lord I Just Surrender my all hallelujah amen I wonder throughout this building as maybe we could stand maybe that's what you would like to do this morning Lord I want to surrender my all I want to surrender my all to you Hallelujah if you've never repented and walked into the Waters of baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a start right there that's right that's a start let me tell you how Abraham started you look over in Genesis 22 and what you see there where he offered up and went to take Isaac and the ram came on the scene but I'm going to tell you it was the same God that started with Abraham's life in gen Genesis 11 that led him 11 chapters [Music] later don't despise Small Things what God is calling you to do do it surrender to the word Lord I I want my life I want that character in my life that Lord to where that what is in here what what I have testified what what I say I I'm a Christian I'm a believer I'm standing for this message this this word that's been revealed in this hour Jesus Christ that's who it is that Lord when I when leaving out of here that's the testimony that's the identification that Lord that I want in my life I wonder how many say Amen to that Lord be it unto me that's what I want Lord maybe with an uplifted hand Lord that's what I want I want to be identified with you if there's any identification I want in this hour I want to be identified with him I want to be identified with the greatest man that ever lived the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit living in me hallelujah hallelujah bless your name Lord Jesus granted Lord for every desire Lord behind every uplifted hand Lord father you know where each life is at Lord you know where each heart is at Lord You're the same God that took Abraham Lord all the way oh there were many bumps in the road but father you moved and you dealt and you worked with Abraham you brought him into a place of full maturity you dealt with his life step by step of the way Lord God I pray Grant it this morning for every desire for every uplifted hand for every heart that's behind it Lord grant it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen Jesus I want to be more like you to the vessel you

reage has a quick testimony I'd like to share with you here real quick I know I haven't given testimony for a very long time uh I can give you a testimony up to date but I just feel led to give this one that is buried in the treasure box of of Miracles that I've seen you know I dedicated my daughter we my wife and I dedicated my daughter when she was a baby and and we always trusted in God and the Lord to watch over her and my daughter was about 5 years old and I told my wife I says um I'm going to go cut the grass it was one of these times that the grass grew the rain came it grew then the sunlight came out and I didn't have a chance to cut it because it was still wet and it went about a week like that off and on I worked shifts so I there's times that I couldn't go out there just to cut the grass the next day next morning or whatever and finally it you know the we weather was all right the grass grew but it was about this high and I had a lwn more and to cut that grass I had to lift it up and then have it come down like this and I had to do that the whole yard and I says something came to my mind what if there's a can in there in that grass it was in the front lawn and I told my wife before I left out of the house I said I'm going to go cut the grass I need to do it now you know it'll be a jungle you know it was already one already but but uh I said so you make sure Anita don't go out she was only about 5 years old so she says I'll watch her I don't know what happened but Anita open unlocked the door and came out while I was cutting the grass and she came by the side uh driveway she was only about that big and I was cutting it and when I cut it down I heard now mind you I didn't have a cover for it but it was going just chopping and it went uh you know how to cut the uh how lawnmower Cuts well it shoots out and it goes up my daughter was standing right there and I looked and that can it was a the top of the can that cut in half and it started swirling and it went right to her right there by the grace of God I said in the name of Lord Jesus Christ you stop and it was at her height where that can lid went up and it stopped right in front of her spinning right in front of her eyes and she was like remember I already said you stop and after it stopped spinning it dropped right in front of her I just felt led to share that I know it's it's a long time ago but I can give you up to dates of other Miracles but I just feel led to say that that dedication to children to babies it's not just anything to overlook we put them in the hands of God and God is still watching over them in the name of Jesus Christ God bless you all [Applause] hallu you know when the Bible says train up a child in the way it should go and when it grows old it'll never depart you know brother Bram talked about many times when you take back that scripture believe on the Lord and thy and thy house shall be saved GL it wasn't for the Philippian Jailer to figure it out but he invited the word of God into his home and I tell you God takes situations that look impossible and God still changes lives listen friends God God don't just specialize in Taking Lives that we say well that's a good person God Specializes in Taking Lives where there seems to be no hope and what was wrote off there's a man standing right here now it's very present brother Matt didn't even believe in God but God got a hold of his life God revealed himself to him move for him and sister Heidi and look look at the effect look at the effect of Christ through their lives what what I'm trying to say is is that God knows what he's placed in every one of us God knows what's there in your wife in your in your in your husband God knows knows what is there in the children stand upon that of God's word you believe and thy and thy house shall be saved the prophet said you may not even live to see your children come in he said but I can tell you your prayers have not been wasted there's a man there's a there's a lady by the name in the scriptures the name of Elizabeth and she prayed for her husband Zacharias is that right I think I got the right name he was a Critic right and he began to get more contener and the prophet told us he said them when you begin to see that that's a sure sign that God's dealing with their life he got to such a place to where he had to find out what is it that's dealing with Elizabeth's life you remember zakus he had to climb a tree shortest man had to climb a tree in order to see the Mighty God that had come down among us go God's word will not return to him void just because you don't it seems like some of the prayers you prayed it seems like things are going the opposite way your prayers are not in vain they're not in vain God knows each one of them they're not just out here he stores them and the effects of them it begins to be poured out in its time don't you love him amen amen Hallelujah heavenly father thank you for your mercies this morning
