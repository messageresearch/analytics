[37:19] amen let's go right to the word of God
[37:22] in Isaiah the 60th chapter
[37:31] was a little late getting to the house
[37:32] of God this morning
[37:34] excuse me for that
[37:36] kind of been one of those Sunday
[37:37] mornings
[37:39] I don't know if you've ever had those
[37:41] but uh you know we were on the way up
[37:44] here and and hit the first toll booth
[37:46] there on the turnpike rolled my window
[37:48] down to get the ticket the window never
[37:50] rolled back up
[37:52] so I had a lot of fresh air this morning
[37:56] and
[37:57] pulled over at the service plaza bought
[38:00] a hat came to church so if I got a
[38:03] little hat here this morning that's why
[38:04] and and uh but uh you know just one of
[38:07] those things of course then we got to
[38:09] the we got to the exit Booth here and
[38:12] realized somewhere in the jumble I lost
[38:13] my ticket so they charged me all the way
[38:15] back to the state line you know and
[38:18] so anyway my title this morning is look
[38:21] on the bright side
[38:24] so we'll read out of Isaiah chapter 60
[38:26] take our texts amen my brother Andrew
[38:29] Glover was preaching at the home Church
[38:30] there Thursday said none of these things
[38:32] move me quote in the scripture amen
[38:34] that's that's uh that's where we're at
[38:37] amen come what may we know where we
[38:40] stand in him
[38:42] Isaiah chapter 60 verse 1. of course a
[38:45] very very familiar scripture to the
[38:47] bride of Christ
[38:49] he says arise shine
[38:53] for thy light is come
[38:56] and the glory of the Lord is risen
[38:59] upon thee
[39:01] for Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[39:03] Earth gross Darkness the people that
[39:06] that's heavy or you know weighty
[39:08] Darkness
[39:10] will cover the people but the Lord shall
[39:13] arise upon thee
[39:15] and His glory shall be seen upon thee
[39:19] and the Gentiles shall come to thy light
[39:22] and to the brightness of thy Rising amen
[39:26] what precious words let's have a word of
[39:28] prayer Heavenly Father we thank you so
[39:30] much for your blessings on us Lord and
[39:33] for this identification Lord of Light in
[39:36] the scripture Lord and father we know
[39:38] that our light has come Lord we know
[39:40] this is a fulfilled scripture in our day
[39:42] and so it we're so happy father what do
[39:45] we have to complain about Lord when our
[39:47] eyes have been opened to your glorious
[39:49] light father oh God it means everything
[39:51] to us Lord and we want to give our whole
[39:54] lives to this father we ask Lord as we
[39:56] would just uh Endeavor to minister your
[39:58] word father we know as human beings
[40:00] we're insufficient but Lord if your
[40:02] spirit could come amongst us today Lord
[40:04] and have Liberty and Shalom is a very
[40:06] special message it comes at very the
[40:09] very end of brother Brandon's Ministry
[40:11] and uh and it's it's it's well after the
[40:15] denominational Realms and and his
[40:17] denominational connections have pulled
[40:19] away from him Shalom is not a message to
[40:21] the public it's not not a it's not a you
[40:24] know it's not a great uh uh uh you know
[40:26] it's not for the wasn't for the great
[40:28] Crusades and the great public Ministry
[40:30] Shalom is a message to the Bride of
[40:32] Jesus Christ it is a special it's a
[40:35] special little thing put in there just
[40:37] for the bride of Christ amen and and uh
[40:40] and so when we read in this scripture
[40:42] it's speaking of a light which is going
[40:44] to come to God's people now it speaks a
[40:46] lot about Darkness Darkness is in there
[40:48] amen but the darkness is a side note the
[40:51] darkness you know is the context amen
[40:54] that's giving meaning to the light that
[40:56] is coming amen and and that's something
[40:58] we should never forget as Believers you
[41:01] know we should always have our eyes on
[41:03] the right side of it we should look on
[41:05] the bright side you know so to speak
[41:06] because there's a lot of Darkness to
[41:08] look at in the world Amen everybody you
[41:11] know we're just very aware that the
[41:13] world is dark and it has become darker
[41:15] amen and and it's getting darker all the
[41:18] time and not only are the circumstances
[41:21] of the world dark but but more so
[41:23] there's a Darkness that's in the hearts
[41:25] of people amen which is a heavy it's a
[41:28] gross Darkness it's just an overpowering
[41:31] darkness that has come into the hearts
[41:32] of the people when we see the state of
[41:35] the nation when we see the state of the
[41:36] world the state of the environment all
[41:38] these things amen it is a dark time but
[41:42] the darkness and and it shouldn't
[41:44] surprise anybody because the darkness is
[41:46] prophesied in the scripture to come amen
[41:48] it's a the darkness itself is a
[41:51] fulfillment of Prophecy but the object
[41:54] of the prophecy the focus of the
[41:56] prophecy is not all this Darkness out
[41:58] here but the prophecy is speaking of a
[42:01] light which will come in a dark age amen
[42:04] and to those who are the recipients of
[42:06] the light it is Shalom it's a good
[42:08] morning it's Sunrise it's good news amen
[42:11] there is so much glory in this message
[42:15] to the elected people to the Bride of
[42:18] Jesus Christ amen we can spend every day
[42:20] of Our Lives looking at the light and
[42:22] never ever get to the darkness amen amen
[42:24] because it's just the framework amen
[42:27] which makes the light shine ever
[42:28] brighter to us amen the message Heralds
[42:31] the light and so your message is Shalom
[42:34] amen and that's a beautiful message amen
[42:37] it's a beautiful message of Shalom when
[42:39] you when you realize that you are
[42:41] identified with the light the light is
[42:44] your identity it's your identification
[42:46] it's your part of the scripture there's
[42:49] a people which are called to manifest
[42:50] darkness in this time amen but there is
[42:53] an elected bride amen who is to receive
[42:55] and show forth the light amen and light
[42:58] is your message light is your identity

[43:06] glorious thing that is to be under a
[43:08] message Shalom amen amen to realize that
[43:11] that that uh you know when God sends a
[43:14] message and you've heard me preach this
[43:16] before but when God sends a message with
[43:18] a messenger it's always twofold there's
[43:20] a message to the world and the mess is
[43:22] to the world is one of judgment amen
[43:24] it's judgment to the world it's a
[43:26] correction to the to the you know to the
[43:29] structures of of man but but to God's
[43:32] elect it's Grace it's always Grace
[43:34] there's no judgment on her amen amen see
[43:38] to the world this message carried
[43:40] indictment it was an indictment to this
[43:42] generation indictment to the churches
[43:44] indictment to the nation but not to the
[43:47] bride to the bride it is Shalom good

[44:37] Christ
[44:38] our light has come brother sister amen
[44:41] and many times we're guilty of just uh
[44:43] of not reveling in this thought is the
[44:46] same Pillar of Fire here today
[44:48] interpreting the Bible amen how we thank
[44:52] him for that what a comfort what
[44:55] identification
[44:57] think of that what identification the
[45:00] pillar of fire that came on men of old
[45:03] to write the Bible that same Pillar of
[45:05] Fire amen came in Malachi 4 to interpret
[45:09] the Bible and that's your identification
[45:11] because the same pillar fire is in the
[45:15] many member body of Jesus Christ
[45:17] fulfilling the Bible amen that's our
[45:20] identity that's our headship that's our
[45:22] name it's the Lord Jesus Christ the
[45:25] angel of the Covenant has tabernacled
[45:27] his fire in the hearts amen of the Bride
[45:30] of Jesus Christ she's got the light amen
[45:33] you're not creatures of Darkness but
[45:36] you're you are light amen he said I'm so
[45:39] glad to be identified in that I don't
[45:41] know what to do I'd rather be identified
[45:43] in that than all the Baptist methodists
[45:46] Presbyterian Lutheran all the rest of
[45:48] them identified in that word where the
[45:51] Shekinah Glory and Revelation lay
[45:53] hallelujah amen amen now this message is
[45:56] a word about identification this message
[45:59] is not about what's happening around you
[46:02] but it's about who you are
[46:06] your identification is not in this Sodom
[46:08] I know the world is wicked I know it's
[46:10] falling apart brother Branham said it
[46:12] was falling apart amen he preached the
[46:14] message the world is now falling apart
[46:16] and now it's just it's a part amen it's
[46:20] it's a it's in a bad State amen but it's
[46:23] not our identification we don't belong
[46:26] to it we're not responsible for it amen
[46:29] our light has come and separated us out
[46:32] of a Sodom condition amen amen oh
[46:36] Hallelujah yeah you know sure we uh
[46:39] absolutely we sigh and cry for the
[46:41] Abominations amen we it certainly if it
[46:44] doesn't move our hearts to see the
[46:46] wickedness that is in the world Amen
[46:48] brother Brandon one time made that you
[46:49] know part of the evidence of the Holy
[46:50] Ghost was sighing and crying for the
[46:53] Abominations of the city that's that's
[46:55] true you know we don't like to see the
[46:57] world coming to where it's at we don't
[46:59] like to see all those things but yet
[47:01] it's not our identification don't ever
[47:04] lose sight of that amen that you've been
[47:06] separated from it thank God that you
[47:08] have amen Sodom is not your
[47:10] identification you have been called out
[47:13] of Sodom the angel that came to you did
[47:15] not come to you and shot him amen but it
[47:18] separated you to the tent of a prophet
[47:20] amen oh my that's where we're at friends
[47:22] you realize our identification is not
[47:25] with the fire and the brimstone but
[47:27] we're in Abraham's tent and what's
[47:30] happening in Abraham's tent God is
[47:32] taking flesh hearts are being addressed
[47:35] amen bodies are changing in Abraham's
[47:39] tent that's where I want to be bro
[47:41] sister I tell you when we look around
[47:43] you know that's certainly in the natural
[47:45] sometimes we get places in our life
[47:47] where things aren't going the way that
[47:48] we wish they would amen we make mistakes
[47:51] and things we get like Jonah brother
[47:53] Bram said everywhere Jonah looked all he
[47:55] saw was well Billy oh just stinking
[47:59] failure all around him friends that's
[48:01] what he see that's where we get with our
[48:03] natural eyes sometime well I should have
[48:06] done this amen I wish that would have
[48:08] happened well Bailey whale Bailey amen
[48:11] but with spiritualized friends when we
[48:13] look around you're not seeing whale
[48:15] belly we're not seeing the Firefall
[48:18] we're not seeing the brimstone we're not
[48:20] seeing the wickedness but everywhere you
[48:23] look it's tent walls cause you're in
[48:26] Abraham's chat friends amen you got a
[48:29] tent vision
[48:31] Hallelujah I look around I see tent tent
[48:36] tent I'm separated from this world I'm
[48:40] called out of her I'm separated oh I'm
[48:43] no longer a church I'm the Bride of
[48:45] Jesus Christ I've got tent Vision I'm
[48:48] under a promise he said I'll meet you in
[48:51] there
[48:53] Hallelujah
[48:55] hurry
[48:56] ten Vision amen
[48:58] [Music]
[49:00] said the one who stayed back with
[49:01] Abraham told him what Sarah was doing
[49:04] and thinking all those miraculous things
[49:06] but Jesus was the one in that person and
[49:09] he said when this world gets in a Sodom
[49:10] condition
[49:11] the son of man will be revealed again
[49:14] and now we see that same promised word
[49:16] all these other promises made flesh
[49:19] today
[49:21] as we heard with our ears
[49:24] now we see him with our eyes
[49:28] blessed are your eyes for they see amen
[49:32] see what his presence amen we heard with
[49:36] our eyes but now we see him we heard
[49:39] with our ears we see him with our eyes
[49:41] interpreting his own word we don't need
[49:44] any interpretation of man
[49:47] we don't need any interpretation of man
[49:49] if you think this message is all about
[49:51] you know run down to brother so-and-so's
[49:53] church and get under his teaching and
[49:55] that one what his opinion about it you
[49:58] know in your little background and your
[50:00] little idea and your little pet Doctrine
[50:02] friends we don't need that we're beyond
[50:05] that amen that's good in Sodom but not
[50:08] in this light amen when you walk in the
[50:10] light he is in the light and he is his
[50:13] own interpreter he is present amongst us
[50:16] to make this word live
[50:18] amen that's what the Holy Ghost was
[50:20] given for to be our inside teacher to
[50:23] lead us into all truth Oh Glory to God
[50:25] friends we don't need any interpretation
[50:28] of man Hallelujah we don't need a new
[50:30] message we don't need a new messenger we
[50:33] need a revelation of the message we've
[50:35] already received amen I've heard
[50:38] but now I see amen amen and so you know
[50:42] all this pressure that we feel from this
[50:44] world around us pressing down pressing
[50:46] down all the time certainly you feel the
[50:48] pressure I feel the pressure amen but
[50:51] you know it's not just the darkness
[50:52] pressing brother Brown said what that
[50:54] pressure is amen is it's the light
[50:57] pressing against the darkness when
[50:59] people press on you they can't help that
[51:01] because the dot the light that's in you
[51:04] is pressing the darkness that's in them
[51:06] amen oh my you know how it is sometimes
[51:09] some people you get around they got such
[51:10] a spirit on them you know where a
[51:13] Christian walks in the restaurant walks
[51:14] in the workplace walks into Walmart and
[51:17] oh right away you know it's a pressure
[51:20] why because you're carrying a light amen
[51:23] amen and so don't look at the darkness
[51:25] it's the light that's brought the
[51:27] pressure
[51:28] amen but thank God for the light
[51:30] amen we uh we we say oh brother Nathan
[51:34] you know the church the bride is under
[51:36] such pressure today such critics have
[51:38] risen up such fallings away such
[51:41] problems around the message all these
[51:43] things certainly there are amen oh you
[51:46] know uh it just seems like it's down to
[51:49] a minority brother bran said it would be
[51:51] he said it would get down to a minority
[51:53] said it would be lesson number but
[51:56] greater in power
[51:58] hey man why because I know are you back
[52:01] to light in the corner you'll never
[52:02] weaken that light all you can do is
[52:05] condense it make it brighter make it
[52:08] more oh make it more focused make it
[52:10] more powerful hallelujah amen amen that
[52:14] is what is happening amen look at the
[52:18] circumstances of brother Brandon
[52:19] preaching shalom
[52:20] here's a prophet of God I'm sure I've
[52:23] shared this with you before but but just
[52:25] think this struck me one day looking at
[52:27] brother Branham he's preaching the
[52:28] message Shalom and brother Branham is a
[52:30] man who is accustomed to preaching you
[52:32] know Revival meetings and Crusades and
[52:34] things all around the world he'd been
[52:36] all around the globe he preached to tens
[52:38] of thousands of people at a time in in
[52:41] soccer stadiums and amphitheaters and
[52:43] all those kind of things brother Brandon
[52:46] preached a meaning in South Africa I
[52:47] believe it was 30 000 people came to the
[52:49] Lord in one meeting
[52:51] amen 30 000 people
[52:54] you know that was the height so where
[52:56] God's Eagle had flown
[52:58] and now he's in Sierra Vista Arizona
[53:02] in a house
[53:04] with a handful of people and there's
[53:07] maybe and the churches in the whole
[53:08] state of Arizona that would have him
[53:10] come preach you could count on one hand
[53:12] and it looks like his his ministry has
[53:16] totally failed
[53:18] it looks like he's just totally come to
[53:20] the Twilight totally diminished and that
[53:22] the Lord is totally done with him
[53:24] because here's this great you know
[53:25] worldwide preacher in a house in severe
[53:28] Sierra Vista Arizona and you can and
[53:31] that's and that's no magic thing you can
[53:33] hear that in brother Brown's voice
[53:34] around this time you can feel the pain
[53:37] of rejection you can it's certainly the
[53:39] human the humanity is suffering that
[53:43] amen but see the the gift that's in him
[53:46] amen is seeing what the Lord is doing
[53:48] amen when it comes down to a minority
[53:50] when it comes to the point of the
[53:52] Capstone like that right you know it's
[53:54] not it's not diminishing it's refining
[53:56] that's why brother Branham could sit in
[53:59] Sierra Vista and preach not a message of
[54:01] discouragement but he's preaching Shalom
[54:04] he's preaching Victory Day amen cause he
[54:08] knew it might be a minority but there
[54:10] will be a people who will walk in this
[54:12] light and here we are brother sister
[54:15] amen with a with a positive gospel
[54:18] Hallelujah with a glorious Revelation
[54:20] walking in the light of this message
[54:22] brother man said when it looks like the
[54:24] message and the messenger is just about
[54:26] defeated that's when he steps in he said
[54:29] he lets it get to that place and then he
[54:32] steps in and he rides the high waves
[54:34] friends amen I'm Not Afraid come with me
[54:37] amen like we say none of these things
[54:40] move me come let me Amen Let It Come
[54:43] amen but the Bride of Jesus Christ will
[54:45] stare amen because why she's not the one
[54:48] holding on but there's someone in the
[54:51] ship amen there's a captain at the hell
[54:53] he'll press every wave amen don't you
[54:57] worry whether you're going to take a
[54:58] Rapture just write on it amen amen it's
[55:01] messaging right on it
[55:05] Hallelujah
[55:07] Amen brother Ram talk about the layout
[55:09] of seeing Church action the Lord himself
[55:11] took his finger amen and and wrote it on
[55:14] the wall of the church amen where it
[55:16] would come to in this layout asean age
[55:18] it'd be so much Darkness until it just
[55:21] be barely a sliver at the top amen it'd
[55:24] be chock full of Darkness hey man
[55:26] brother Ronnie is preaching home I love
[55:28] the way he pointed us out he said you
[55:29] look at that picture on the wall you
[55:31] know of those of those Church ages and
[55:33] look at it come down just to that sliver
[55:35] that's not empty space
[55:37] that's light it might just be a sliver
[55:40] but it's light it's not void it's not
[55:43] emptiness it's not hopelessness it's
[55:46] light and
[55:47] compress it down it's just a sliver
[55:49] it'll never stop shining it'll still
[55:52] Pierce The Darkness oh it'll still have
[55:55] Victory amen it's light it's light
[55:59] amen and we gotta focus on that light
[56:01] brother sister that's what our eyes
[56:03] should be on is the light of this day
[56:05] amen a message came so that we could
[56:07] recognize our day not recognize the
[56:10] night recognize our day amen amen
[56:13] because Daybreak means freedom Daybreak
[56:16] means Rapture Day of break is Hope and
[56:18] glory amen oh in Victory amen like
[56:21] brother bran told the story you know of
[56:24] uh of uh when the Emancipation
[56:25] Proclamation was signed and there was a
[56:28] there was a predestinated sunrise amen
[56:31] when all the people would go free amen
[56:34] and you know but there were a lot of
[56:36] people down in a deep valley amen like
[56:38] we get down in valleys in our life and
[56:40] down in that Valley you know they were
[56:42] under the shadow of the mountains that
[56:44] they were facing amen and they could not
[56:46] see that Sunrise but God raised somebody
[56:48] up amen that could climb up to the top
[56:50] of the mountain amen and stand up there
[56:53] amen and see the breaking of the day and
[56:55] call down to the people and say don't
[56:57] worry Church it is the rising of the sun
[57:00] yeah I see Shalom I see sunlight Over
[57:04] the Horizon you might not look like it
[57:06] you might not feel like it but you are
[57:09] free
[57:09] [Applause]
[57:10] the Daybreak has come upon you Shalom
[57:13] Pride your line has come and the glory
[57:16] of the Lord is risen
[57:19] upon thee
[57:22] hallelujah
[57:24] amen thank God for a prophet that could
[57:26] climb up and and read the back part of
[57:28] God's mind amen and see that'll never
[57:32] leave us or forsake us and oh friends
[57:35] you will never put this bride under the
[57:37] layout of seeing rebuke she is not blind
[57:39] she is not wretched she is not naked she
[57:43] has been clothed by this word amen a
[57:46] crown of light is upon her Hallelujah
[57:49] she's under Shalom she's married to her
[57:52] bridegroom
[57:54] not a not a not an ounce of judgment
[57:56] construct this Earth until she's in the
[57:58] palace there's not a bomb that can fall
[58:01] friends
[58:01] amen until we're out of here
[58:04] that's our identification Hallelujah
[58:07] brother Graham said yeah the Shuck's
[58:09] pulling away but now the Wheats begin to
[58:11] be seen
[58:12] so not a Pentecostal age
[58:17] this is the evening light this is
[58:20] Malachi 4. it's Luke 17 30. it's
[58:23] Jeremiah it's Joel I have heard Lord
[58:26] that it was coming but now
[58:29] a kid with my eyes
[58:33] Hallelujah
[58:34] this is our that's our identification
[58:37] around the evening time when things get
[58:40] dark
[58:41] there will be light
[58:43] there will be light now how many know
[58:45] that light in the scripture is
[58:47] manifested word
[58:49] light is manifested word now for it to
[58:52] be light it's got to be manifested now
[58:55] we can we can read it quote it talk
[58:57] about it amen even preach about it
[59:00] amen I'll give him a quote in a moment
[59:02] amen but it's got to be manifested then
[59:05] it becomes light and that's our
[59:07] identification as bright church amen is
[59:10] uh is with a manifested word that's the
[59:13] kind of word we're interested in amen is
[59:16] a word that comes off the pages of the
[59:18] Bible and becomes Spirit quickened to be
[59:22] a real and living God working in our
[59:24] midst
[59:25] amen hallelujah brother Brown said you
[59:28] know but the it and and that's that's
[59:31] what separates us from laodicea amen
[59:34] because we're not lukewarm
[59:36] amen but many people many people get
[59:39] under that I think because they're
[59:40] looking at the wrong thing or expecting
[59:42] the wrong thing my brother bran said you
[59:45] know he said we have no enthusiasm
[59:48] it doesn't seem to strike us right you
[59:50] ever been in that connect in that
[59:51] condition
[59:52] just doesn't quite strike you right you
[59:55] know that something's wrong you don't
[59:56] have enthusiasm he said it's like talks
[59:58] about taking a match you know it's and
[1:00:01] you could just take that match and
[1:00:02] strike it and rake it and rake it and
[1:00:04] rake it amen but if there's no sulfur on
[1:00:07] the head of that match if it doesn't
[1:00:08] have the right substance to it amen rake
[1:00:11] all you want he said there will be no
[1:00:13] light amen but if that chemical if if
[1:00:17] it's there when it strikes it will light
[1:00:19] amen amen and see when the true genuine
[1:00:22] uh Vindication of the scriptures of this
[1:00:26] last day message when you see the
[1:00:28] presence of Jesus Christ just before the
[1:00:30] Sodom conditions fired over you see
[1:00:33] Jesus return amongst his people formed
[1:00:36] in human flesh and do the same thing
[1:00:38] that he done
[1:00:39] what ought it to do it ought to strike
[1:00:42] our souls to Glory
[1:00:45] amen it ought to do something to us why
[1:00:48] it's dropping on that amen friends this
[1:00:52] is no time to be discouraged this is no
[1:00:55] time for wowzy wowzy wounds this is no
[1:00:58] time you know to be speaking the devil's
[1:01:00] language this is a glorious time because
[1:01:03] the bride amen is not a Pentecostal with
[1:01:06] no mechanics she's not a Baptist with no
[1:01:09] Dynamics she's got the mechanics and the
[1:01:12] Dynamics amen she's got the the sofa
[1:01:15] she's got the spark amen and it's
[1:01:18] dropping on her it ought to strike our
[1:01:21] hearts to Glory
[1:01:22] there ought to be a manifestation
[1:01:24] amongst us we ought to see the
[1:01:26] supernatural we ought to see the moving
[1:01:28] of the spirit the reason we don't we're
[1:01:30] not looking at the light you got looking
[1:01:32] at the darkness and you got under that
[1:01:34] lukewarm condition but turn your eyes
[1:01:36] back on this word
[1:01:38] walk in this light
[1:01:40] and it'll be a manifested word
[1:01:43] oh the word is light but only when it's
[1:01:45] manifested
[1:01:47] only when it's manifested that's why we
[1:01:50] see so much organized religion
[1:01:52] so much denominationalism around the
[1:01:54] message formality around the message
[1:01:57] they're not walking in the light
[1:01:59] not basking in the light
[1:02:02] well but we say well but you know we got
[1:02:04] the word brother Nathan we got the word
[1:02:06] now
[1:02:07] so you got to be careful all this
[1:02:09] talking about Holy Ghost and yeah
[1:02:11] Dynamics and all that kind of that
[1:02:12] sounds a little Pentecostal to me
[1:02:14] well
[1:02:16] you know yeah we got the word
[1:02:19] we have the body word of Jesus Christ
[1:02:22] amen that's what we're feeding on is the
[1:02:25] body word of Jesus Christ the brother
[1:02:27] bran said sure the body was Christ and
[1:02:29] the message look he says and if Christ
[1:02:31] means the anointed one
[1:02:33] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:02:35] forever
[1:02:36] and he is the word then the word is the
[1:02:40] anointing
[1:02:42] let that hover in the atmosphere for a
[1:02:44] moment the word is the anointing
[1:02:47] you say we got the word we sure do
[1:02:50] amen and if it's the word it is Anointed
[1:02:54] it has a presence it has an atmosphere
[1:02:58] it has power it has works it has signs
[1:03:02] it has Wonders It has gifts it has a
[1:03:05] Supernatural That's the characteristics
[1:03:07] of God friends though we have the word
[1:03:10] and the word is the anointing he said
[1:03:13] another play in the unveiling of God he
[1:03:14] said the word is God he said the
[1:03:16] anointing is a person the anointing is
[1:03:20] not emotion the anointing is not a
[1:03:23] workup amen the anointing is supreme
[1:03:25] power coming down into a human being
[1:03:28] amen supreme power gets in control and
[1:03:31] it brings a power to the church the sick
[1:03:34] will be healed the bound will be set
[1:03:36] free amen The Sinner will be saved the
[1:03:40] loss will be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:41] why because the anointing is a person
[1:03:45] you can touch him you can talk to him
[1:03:48] he's real
[1:03:50] Hallelujah
[1:03:51] and we talk so much about the word
[1:03:54] amen but the word is a person
[1:03:57] like we sing the song back home I love
[1:04:00] this song uh you know the word has a
[1:04:02] name
[1:04:03] yeah and it's Jesus
[1:04:06] I like that you know
[1:04:08] now let's say you know
[1:04:10] let's imagine I after service today if I
[1:04:13] was to go out to to get lunch with
[1:04:15] brother Brian sister Gracie
[1:04:17] and I sat down talked to sister Gracie
[1:04:19] and just just went on and on oh you know
[1:04:22] I'm so glad that I could go out to lunch
[1:04:24] with your husband
[1:04:26] you know I just really I I your
[1:04:28] husband's a buddy of mine I just think
[1:04:30] he's a great guy really admire his Stan
[1:04:33] everything just I just feel so blessed
[1:04:35] you know that I'm here and I get to be
[1:04:37] with your husband and just carry on like
[1:04:39] that a little while she might get a
[1:04:41] little weird look on her face
[1:04:44] and eventually she might reach it lean
[1:04:45] over and just kind of you know my
[1:04:48] husband has a name
[1:04:50] in other words he's right here
[1:04:53] why don't you talk to him why don't you
[1:04:55] fellowship with him why don't you look
[1:04:57] at him he's here he's present he's not
[1:05:01] just a name he's not just a theory he's
[1:05:04] not just a a mental conception he's a
[1:05:06] presence he's a person he's got a
[1:05:09] character you can fellowship with him
[1:05:11] you can talk with him that's the kind of
[1:05:12] a god this message came to bring to us
[1:05:14] Amen to God that can be touched a God
[1:05:17] that can speak to your heart a God that
[1:05:20] can be present amongst us not just a
[1:05:22] word an anointed word a Living Word an
[1:05:26] atmosphere
[1:05:27] Supernatural alive
[1:05:30] oh the word has a name amen when you
[1:05:33] walk in the light you say oh what we
[1:05:34] need to do is bask in the light of the
[1:05:36] word I believe in that but I don't
[1:05:38] believe that's that's trying to educate
[1:05:39] ourselves into some mental conception
[1:05:42] amen and prove how smart we are get out
[1:05:45] in the parking lot and swap quotes and
[1:05:46] try to blow someone mind to prove how
[1:05:49] spiritual that we are I believe if you
[1:05:51] walk in the light he will be in the
[1:05:54] light and you will be in his presence if
[1:05:57] you can walk in this light
[1:05:59] Hallelujah the anointing is a person
[1:06:02] amen you say I don't know brother Nathan
[1:06:04] well look at what brother bran said
[1:06:06] about the road to Emmaus he appreciated
[1:06:08] many times how these two disciples are
[1:06:11] walking with Jesus
[1:06:14] now their Fellowship was not with the
[1:06:16] Devil
[1:06:17] the fellowship was not with a false
[1:06:18] teacher I'll read some of these use some
[1:06:21] of these phrases Verbatim what how
[1:06:22] brother Brown says it he said they're
[1:06:24] walking with the resurrected Messiah
[1:06:29] he is revealing the word
[1:06:33] he's expounding them the scriptures
[1:06:36] preach the word read it right out of the
[1:06:39] Bible
[1:06:40] and they still didn't get it
[1:06:44] you see there's a there's a there's a
[1:06:47] place where the preaching of the word is
[1:06:49] not enough
[1:06:51] to now the scriptures is not enough
[1:06:54] amen he said it was the resurrected
[1:06:56] Messiah was walking with them teaching
[1:06:59] them revealing it to them you say well
[1:07:02] brother Nathan I go to a good church
[1:07:03] with a god called Pastor and he's
[1:07:05] preaching the words of life to me that's
[1:07:07] not a revelation
[1:07:09] that's just joining a church amen but
[1:07:12] when you walk in the light you got to
[1:07:13] come to a place where he comes inside
[1:07:15] and when he comes in personally and
[1:07:19] breaks the bread of life to you that's
[1:07:20] when it becomes revealed that's when
[1:07:22] your eyes are open it's the personal
[1:07:24] presence of Jesus Christ
[1:07:26] that identifies you and opens our eyes
[1:07:29] to what it is we believe in teaching the
[1:07:31] word absolutely we believe in God called
[1:07:33] men preaching the word revealing the
[1:07:36] word expounding the scriptures reading
[1:07:38] it out of the Bible amen but if Jesus
[1:07:40] Christ doesn't come down in the church
[1:07:42] and make himself real to the individual
[1:07:46] all we got is another Creed
[1:07:49] amen they could not see the light the
[1:07:53] intellectual mind cannot see it
[1:07:55] it's actually impossible for the
[1:07:57] intellectual mind to receive this
[1:07:59] revelation
[1:08:00] it takes the personal presence
[1:08:03] you because put yourself in their mind
[1:08:04] now they're looking around
[1:08:07] and their eyes are on the wrong thing
[1:08:10] because here he's walking with them he
[1:08:12] kind of you know they come together on
[1:08:13] the road
[1:08:14] sometimes God walks with us longer than
[1:08:16] we realize we don't even realize that
[1:08:19] he's spending a little time with us and
[1:08:21] we're just our minds are so full of
[1:08:23] what's going on you know the budget and
[1:08:26] world events and the news and all that
[1:08:28] kind of stuff that's all we can think
[1:08:29] about we don't even realize he's walking
[1:08:31] with us and just he's never in a hurry
[1:08:34] he always just takes his time you know I
[1:08:36] love it he just re you know they come
[1:08:38] together on the road the paths converge
[1:08:41] why the long face
[1:08:44] are you serious
[1:08:46] haven't you been reading the news
[1:08:48] don't you know what's going on don't you
[1:08:51] know that this generation crucified the
[1:08:53] word of God they hung him on a tree and
[1:08:55] the and the sky went dark and the war
[1:08:58] the Earth shakes and the veil ripped in
[1:08:59] the temple and now he's gone they
[1:09:01] crucified him everything's fine
[1:09:02] everybody's left him Peter denied him
[1:09:06] don't you know what's happening didn't
[1:09:09] you hear about Ukraine
[1:09:12] don't you hear aren't you looking at
[1:09:13] politics aren't you seeing what's going
[1:09:15] on
[1:09:17] and then he began to say well didn't
[1:09:18] Isaiah say
[1:09:20] that this would happen yeah didn't Moses
[1:09:22] say this would happen you know if you
[1:09:24] run this back to Joel if you're running
[1:09:26] back to Hezekiah didn't didn't you know
[1:09:28] and he began to he began to put the
[1:09:29] scriptures together oh and they still
[1:09:31] didn't see it
[1:09:32] we're so slow you know but he's so
[1:09:35] patient because he begins to walk with
[1:09:37] him amen all but oh but you know look it
[1:09:40] looks like World War III but didn't I
[1:09:42] say not a bomb would drop before the
[1:09:44] bride would be in glory
[1:09:46] didn't I tell you you'd be in a Rapture
[1:09:49] didn't I tell you judgment couldn't come
[1:09:51] on you didn't I tell you Shalom why are
[1:09:54] you looking the darkness why are you
[1:09:57] looking at the earthquakes amen your
[1:09:59] light has come and you don't even
[1:10:01] realize it
[1:10:03] Hallelujah but he's patient enough to
[1:10:06] follow you back home amen and sit with
[1:10:08] you and wait till you get done
[1:10:10] complaining wait till you get done
[1:10:12] worrying about everything to wait till
[1:10:14] you get done balancing the checkbook
[1:10:15] amen and then his presence just sweeps
[1:10:17] down so sweet and he says aren't I a
[1:10:20] personal God to you did I say I'd be
[1:10:23] your portion didn't I say I'd be a
[1:10:26] provider didn't I say I'd heal your body
[1:10:28] didn't I say I be an ever-pleasant hell
[1:10:31] in the time of trouble didn't I say when
[1:10:35] judgment failed you'd be hiding in my
[1:10:37] Pavilion didn't I say there'd be hidden
[1:10:39] power in the secret place

[1:10:43] hey man in that holy of holies where the
[1:10:47] True Believer dwells amen amen they
[1:10:49] thought it was a sign of judgment when
[1:10:51] that veiled ripped from the top to the
[1:10:52] bottom but it was a sign of Grace amen
[1:10:55] because he opened the veil that a
[1:10:57] Believer could get to a place with God a
[1:11:00] place where the man I never goes stale
[1:11:03] where there's Victory all the time
[1:11:05] brother Ram said you find somebody who's
[1:11:07] ever got into there he said you they got

[1:16:26] manifestation of this hour
[1:16:30] that's where God's at that's where he's
[1:16:32] working that's where his focus in this
[1:16:34] message ain't about what happened 60

[1:17:28] it's another Mount Transfiguration and
[1:17:31] it's not just the face of the Prophet
[1:17:34] but it's the whole body of Christ
[1:17:37] shining with the light of the nature of
[1:17:41] God
[1:17:47] friends it's light it's light amen you
[1:17:50] look all through the Bible amen you
[1:17:52] realize that every Prophet that spoke
[1:17:53] about light amen they weren't talking
[1:17:56] about some artificial electric light
[1:17:57] amen Moses never saw an electric light
[1:18:00] Elijah never saw an electric light one
[1:18:03] of these cold LED bulbs that doesn't
[1:18:05] give heat doesn't give warmth amen light
[1:18:08] to Moses was a fire like to Paul was a
[1:18:11] fire amen and this light to me is a fire
[1:18:15] we got too many people talking about the
[1:18:18] word but their life doesn't burn but
[1:18:21] when I saw this light it was a fire shut
[1:18:25] up in my balls
[1:18:29] foreign
[1:18:33] if it doesn't produce the same things it
[1:18:35] did on the day of Pentecost it's a
[1:18:37] man-made artificial religion and never
[1:18:41] came off the candlesticks but brother
[1:18:43] Brown said this ain't Strange Fire this
[1:18:45] is the fire that God started
[1:18:49] Tim's light it is
[1:18:52] operating itself in this age and
[1:18:55] tabernacling licks a fire
[1:18:58] in the vessels of the many member body
[1:19:01] of the Bride of Jesus Christ men and
[1:19:03] women and boys and girls amen that are
[1:19:06] not left comfortless but there's a fire
[1:19:08] burning on the inside
[1:19:11] tell me how you'll take a Rapture
[1:19:13] without this fire
[1:19:15] got to have the oil
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:19] now we don't need all that Pentecostal
[1:19:21] fire brother Nathan that was just for
[1:19:22] the Pentecostals sounds like a foolish
[1:19:24] woman to me sounds like a foolish virgin
[1:19:27] amen but a wise version amen will stay
[1:19:31] full of oil their lamps will be trimmed
[1:19:34] and clear and they'll burn bird till the
[1:19:36] bridegroom comes
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:41] fire that God started oh we can try all
[1:19:44] we want to make improvements to this
[1:19:45] message modernize this message make it
[1:19:48] more appealing to laodicea make it more
[1:19:51] compatible with the modern lifestyle
[1:19:52] friends but until you stop tampering
[1:19:55] with this message and just walk in this
[1:19:57] light it'll never burn for you friends
[1:19:59] amen it won't get you to where you're
[1:20:01] going it'll only ever be an artificial
[1:20:03] light but if you take your hands off the
[1:20:05] word of God and call on the spirit of
[1:20:08] God the anointing to fall on the church
[1:20:10] fall on your family fall on your life
[1:20:15] it'll lead you into all truth it'll lead
[1:20:18] you into a rapture
[1:20:21] lead you to your future home
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:25] said they're looking for something great
[1:20:27] they're looking for something shiny
[1:20:30] but the Holy Spirit doesn't shine it
[1:20:33] glows
[1:20:34] I'm not looking for something new and
[1:20:36] shiny
[1:20:37] no I'm in this glow I'm in the Shekinah
[1:20:41] Glory
[1:20:41] it's a reality to me it's life to me
[1:20:43] it's everything to me get into this
[1:20:45] place friends get into that holy of
[1:20:47] holies get into that hidden life in
[1:20:49] Jesus Christ
[1:20:50] it's the only way
[1:20:53] it doesn't shine it glows oh and then
[1:20:56] brother Branham amen oh he begins to
[1:20:58] pour out his heart amen this is how we
[1:21:00] ought to oh we ought to be just
[1:21:02] vocalized these these these these
[1:21:04] desires these feelings he said China's

[1:21:28] to the Lord amen the atmosphere begins
[1:21:31] to change brother Banner makes this
[1:21:33] statement he says I'm just as aware that
[1:21:35] the spirit of Christ is moving around
[1:21:38] this building this morning the god that
