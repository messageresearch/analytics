[31:58] oh that men would praise the Lord for

[32:06] the longing soul and filth the hungry
[32:09] soul with goodness such as sit in
[32:12] darkness and in the shadow of death
[32:14] being bound in Affliction and iron
[32:16] because they rebelled against the words
[32:18] of God and contemned the counsel of the
[32:21] most high therefore he brought down
[32:24] their heart with labor they fell down
[32:27] and there was none to help
[32:29] him then they Cried unto the Lord in
[32:31] their trouble and he saved them out of
[32:33] their distresses he brought them out of
[32:36] darkness and the shadow of death and
[32:38] break their bands in Sunder oh that men
[32:41] would praise the Lord for his goodness
[32:43] and for his wonderful Works to the
[32:45] children of men for he hath broken the
[32:48] gates of brass and cut the bars of iron
[32:51] and Sunder fools because of their
[32:54] transgression and because of their
[32:55] iniquities are afflicted their their
[32:58] soul uph whth all manner of meat and
[33:00] they draw near unto the gates of death
[33:03] then they cry unto the Lord in their
[33:05] trouble and he saveth them out of their
[33:07] distresses he sent his word and healed
[33:10] them and delivered them from their
[33:12] destructions oh that men would praise
[33:14] the Lord for his goodness and for his
[33:16] wonderful Works to the children of men
[33:19] and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of
[33:22] Thanksgiving and declare his works with
[33:26] rejoicing it's just pray father we come
[33:29] before you this Thursday evening and
[33:31] we're we're thankful Lord we're grateful
[33:33] we've sung the songs of Zion Lord we've
[33:36] worshiped you father and now Lord we
[33:39] look to your word and just ask that you
[33:41] speak Lord help us each one to get out
[33:43] of the way that we could speak and hear
[33:46] from you in Jesus name amen amen you can
[33:49] be
[33:54] seated we greet you in the name of the
[33:56] Lord this evening and it's good to be
[33:58] here it's good to stand before you um
[34:00] I'm understand that you were praying for
[34:03] me through my trial that we've been
[34:04] through and uh so I want to personally
[34:07] thank you for all your prayers and um I
[34:10] have no explanation as to what it was I
[34:13] have no explanation as to why I'm
[34:15] standing here now other than that it was
[34:18] your prayers that that brought me out
[34:20] and um I honestly don't know what took
[34:24] me in so um we're just on the other side
[34:27] and we're grateful and I I just
[34:33] wonder I just wonder sometimes if God
[34:35] does it just to just there's something
[34:38] in it I know that there's something in
[34:40] it so I'm grateful for that but um I
[34:42] don't know how much you heard but um we
[34:44] started back in August last year um the
[34:48] first weekend we were out school
[34:49] shopping and and uh I just just not
[34:53] feeling too good and
[34:55] um uh just I I don't know what how to
[34:58] describe it really next morning the same
[35:01] thing happened um and then a right after
[35:05] that uh it just seemed like it was it
[35:07] was heart attack
[35:09] symptoms um and so just the full thing
[35:12] full spectrum of it and um so that went
[35:15] on I had about six episodes in about a
[35:17] week and a half um finally was up in I
[35:20] work up in Ann Arbor in the office a
[35:22] couple days a week remote a couple more
[35:25] and I was I was just feeling the worst I
[35:28] had and so I went to my boss's office
[35:29] and I said there's a fire station around
[35:31] the corner I said I think I need to go
[35:33] get checked and so from there they
[35:35] checked me out and they said well would
[35:37] you like us to call the ambulance and I
[35:38] said well you're the professional so you
[35:40] tell me and they said well why don't we
[35:42] call them they can check you out okay
[35:44] well they get there and she's checking
[35:46] me out you know they chat with you and
[35:47] everything and then she stood up and she
[35:49] said well what hospital you want to go
[35:50] to and I said well is it that bad and
[35:52] she said well let me you know so you
[35:54] just you hear all stories you know
[35:56] brother-in-laws and things that fell
[35:58] over dead and she was saying because
[36:00] they didn't get checked out and they
[36:02] should have and um so I said well let's
[36:05] go so that started the journey and it
[36:07] was just a roller coaster ride from
[36:08] there um a lot of things in between but
[36:12] I had gotten so weak that um we had a
[36:14] fall Fellowship in October and I I just
[36:18] I I couldn't hardly walk and from that
[36:20] point um I just couldn't walk across the
[36:23] house even uh so I again I don't have an
[36:27] explanation they finally ruled out the
[36:29] heart um and then they they went on to
[36:33] the the brain and I'm grateful that they
[36:35] found a heart and they found a brain so
[36:38] that that rolled out a lot for a lot of
[36:41] people who were
[36:43] wondering I got
[36:46] pictures so so I'm grateful and you know
[36:50] but it it it just um well I just put it
[36:54] this way uh so Janu come January was I
[36:57] was starting to do a little bit better
[36:59] January 1st we got the flu um and it was
[37:02] the worst probably one of the worst flu
[37:04] that I had had well they said probably
[37:06] because coming out of whatever it was I
[37:09] was coming out of went into the flu I
[37:11] went right into pneumonia and
[37:13] bronchitis and um so it just it just
[37:16] wiped me out and it was like if I
[37:18] couldn't have been down
[37:19] lower physically emotionally spiritually
[37:23] it was like the Lord just said well
[37:24] there's a little bit lower you can go
[37:26] and
[37:27] so we went there and uh so I was there
[37:31] was one night I I was coming out of that
[37:34] and and I guess apparently it's
[37:37] something that can happen when you come
[37:39] out of pneumonia but you can break out
[37:41] into like a rash type and um so I I
[37:44] ended up having these bumps all over my
[37:46] back and uh uh coming out of the
[37:49] pneumonia and um I was sitting in the
[37:52] chair and my wife and I were talking and
[37:54] I said well I said I'm going to go sit
[37:55] on my ash Heap and scrp whatever this
[37:58] is and she didn't find that too funny
[38:01] but I did and uh cuz if you know job and
[38:04] the story of Job And so um you know I
[38:08] just been filling my heart you know to
[38:10] go read job and that was kind of the the
[38:13] push to go read job so uh I'm going to
[38:16] read to you out of job tonight we read
[38:17] in Psalms and I'm just trusting that the
[38:20] Lord as I was studying um this is
[38:23] something I preached two parts of back
[38:25] home and there was there was a little SE
[38:27] in there just the Lord kind of took me
[38:29] different um yet last night and and
[38:32] today so I just pray it's a blessing to
[38:34] you I'm just stepping in faith trusting
[38:36] in Him because it's a little different
[38:38] than what I expected but um if you don't
[38:41] mind I'm going to read out of the NIV I
[38:43] hope that doesn't offend anybody but it
[38:45] just reading the book of job I had to
[38:48] have three different translations to get
[38:50] through
[38:51] it and and to come out with some kind of
[38:54] understanding so I'm going to read in uh
[38:58] job 36 starting at verse 4 and um you
[39:03] can follow along again I'll read in the
[39:04] NIV so it'll be a little bit different
[39:06] but um I like I I chose this version
[39:09] because I didn't feel like it was
[39:11] removing anything but it it put it into
[39:14] layman's terms for
[39:15] me Eli who speaking um which if you the
[39:20] story of Job there's three friends come
[39:22] to job well there's a fourth that just
[39:25] kind of showed up I guess I don't know
[39:27] but um it talks about eliu and um we'll
[39:31] we'll just talk a little bit more about
[39:32] him in in a bit but verse uh four be
[39:36] assured that my words are not false one
[39:39] who has perfect knowledge is with you
[39:41] and he's not talking about himself here
[39:43] he's talking about Jesus about God God
[39:46] is mighty but despises no one he is
[39:49] mighty and firm in his purpose he does
[39:52] not keep the wicked alive but gives The
[39:54] Afflicted their rights he does not take
[39:57] his eyes off the righteous he enthrones
[39:59] them with Kings and exalts them forever
[40:02] but if people are bound in Chains held
[40:04] fast by cords of Affliction he tells
[40:07] them what they have done that they have
[40:09] sinned arrogantly he makes them listen
[40:12] to correction and commands them to
[40:14] repent of their evil if they obey him
[40:17] and serve him they will spend the rest
[40:20] of their days in prosperity in their
[40:21] years and contentment but if they do not
[40:24] listen they will perish By The Sword and
[40:27] die die without true
[40:29] knowledge the Godless in heart Harbor
[40:32] resentment even when he Fetters them
[40:34] they do not cry for help they die in
[40:37] their youth among male prostitutes of
[40:40] the shrines but those who suffer he
[40:42] delivers in their suffering he speaks to
[40:45] them in their Affliction notice he
[40:48] speaks to them in their Affliction he is
[40:50] wooing you from the jaws of distress to
[40:53] a spacious Place free from restriction
[40:56] that's good to the Comfort of your table
[40:58] Laden with Choice Foods so as you go
[41:01] through job you realize that you know
[41:03] nobody's been through as bad of a trial
[41:05] as job I wouldn't say um as I was
[41:08] reading job you know you look for a time
[41:10] frame because if you've been through a
[41:12] trial of any length of time and and I
[41:15] just want to say this right off to the
[41:17] start is you know you can't compare your
[41:19] trial to mine and I can't compare my
[41:20] trial to yours because we know that
[41:23] trials were predestinated for you
[41:25] they're tailored to you and that doesn't
[41:27] seem very fair but yet if we know that
[41:30] our trials are more precious than gold
[41:32] yeah have F gold then we know that we
[41:35] can have confidence that that trial has
[41:37] a purpose and that it's the refining
[41:39] fires that's going to bring more if you
[41:42] know anything about gold and and the
[41:43] refining fire as the master smith beats
[41:47] the gold he's beating out all the dross
[41:49] and all the all the imperfections all
[41:51] the impurities and he knows when that
[41:53] gold is refined when he can see his
[41:55] reflection in it and so we go through
[41:57] through our tests and our trials knowing
[41:59] that it's it's the master beating us
[42:02] beating the draw out beating the the
[42:05] impurities out and so that he can see
[42:07] himself so that you reflect Christ in in
[42:10] his
[42:11] fullness and so we don't know exactly
[42:13] how long job's trial was we know that he
[42:16] lost everything in one day the first
[42:18] chapter of job you'll you'll find that
[42:21] while while the servant yet spake the
[42:23] other servant came and while he yet
[42:26] spake the other servant came and while
[42:28] he yet spake the other servant came so
[42:30] this is just bam bam bam bam bam I I
[42:32] don't know job was just probably
[42:34] whiplashed by what just
[42:37] happened and then it says that we get we
[42:39] get another uh inclination as to how
[42:42] much time and um brother I see you back
[42:45] there I just want to say I appreciate
[42:46] the violin you
[42:48] played God bless
[42:51] you the violin has a special place in my
[42:54] heart I just love
[42:55] it and so where were we uh so we know
[42:59] that he after that first day he sat in
[43:01] silence for seven days on the ash Heap
[43:04] because it says when his friends came
[43:06] that they sat in silence they they they
[43:09] uh rent their clothes they sat with him
[43:11] mourning for seven days and they were
[43:14] silent and um we'll get a little bit
[43:16] this this shifted more towards his
[43:18] friends it was just something that when
[43:20] I was preaching I just felt strongly to
[43:22] go into more and so you're getting it
[43:24] tonight but um he uh you know they said
[43:27] as I was reading different things on job
[43:30] and on his friends they said thee best
[43:31] things that his friends did was they
[43:34] just sat with their mouth shut for seven
[43:37] days where they got into trouble was
[43:39] when they opened their mouth and tried
[43:41] to comfort job so so and you know I
[43:44] think I've said it before here and and I
[43:46] remember actually I believe um saying it
[43:49] here was that you know that that little
[43:51] story about the boy and he lost his
[43:52] parents in the fire and you probably
[43:54] remember and um just couldn't get him to
[43:56] talk talk and another little boy came
[43:59] just going quickly through it and U and
[44:01] it just reminded me this this here was
[44:03] where I saw that in the scripture was
[44:05] how do you comfort somebody who's going
[44:07] through a trial how do you comfort
[44:08] someone who's going through a loss
[44:10] sometimes it's just sitting quiet and
[44:12] and crying with them just just sitting
[44:14] with them and and not saying much I
[44:17] think you know we have pure desires to
[44:19] help and comfort each other and uh
[44:22] sometimes though it just it's it's I
[44:25] don't know how to say this and and it
[44:26] not sounds
[44:27] uh straight but sometimes it's just not
[44:29] helpful um I I found that you and I
[44:32] don't mean that in a bad way I just mean
[44:34] there really it's only God who can
[44:36] Comfort blessed are they who mourn for
[44:38] they shall be comforted and the and he
[44:41] is the comforter amen so then in job 7:3
[44:45] are you staying with me okay this is
[44:47] coming out faster than I thought it
[44:49] would so uh job uh just a lot of hay on
[44:52] my Fork I guess job uh 7 and verse three
[44:55] we get another uh insight and he says
[44:58] there's it says months of long nights of
[45:01] misery job refers to there's months of
[45:04] of long nights of misery and so we know
[45:07] that this trial probably went on for
[45:09] months and and you know it's a trial in
[45:12] a day can make you feel exhausted by the
[45:14] end of the day you make it three days
[45:16] you make it a week but you you go months
[45:19] and and it's just exhausting it it and
[45:22] and it really it can have an impact on
[45:24] us in ways that I I I didn't realize it
[45:27] could have an impact on you and and I'll
[45:29] just say this from my experience just
[45:31] being uh transparent is you know really
[45:34] you can you can turn to a lot of things
[45:35] in your trials and when you're feeling
[45:37] that low and um you know you can turn to
[45:40] a lot of things that that you shouldn't
[45:42] there there's a lot of things out there
[45:44] that we can draw comfort from and and
[45:46] Satan puts those things before us and
[45:48] and a lot of times they're just easier
[45:50] to turn to and you know especially when
[45:52] you're feeling low spiritually and and
[45:55] emotionally and and just mentally you're
[45:59] just you you don't have it it feels like
[46:01] you don't have the mental compartment to
[46:04] to Really retain anything and so you
[46:07] just well there's no point in going to
[46:09] it so you you know choose an
[46:11] entertainment or something is that
[46:14] okay so then in in uh job
[46:19] 4 uh we we just I just want to give you
[46:23] um just relating with job through his
[46:25] trial and and just the the emotions and
[46:28] everything that he goes through job 4
[46:29] and verse three again this is the in the
[46:31] NIV one of job's his first friend uh
[46:35] talking think how you have instructed
[46:37] many how you have strengthened feeble
[46:39] hands your words have supported those
[46:41] who stumbled you have strengthen
[46:43] faltering knees but now Trouble Comes To
[46:46] You job and you are discouraged it
[46:49] strikes you and you're dismayed it comes
[46:52] to you and you faint and you're grieved
[46:55] and and you know it's just kind of like
[46:57] job you're down but here let me slap you
[46:59] in the face and knock you down a little
[47:01] bit lower and job really didn't need
[47:04] that he didn't need that not at all it
[47:07] comes to you and you faint and are
[47:09] grieved job in his trial now this is
[47:11] through reading the book of job job and
[47:13] his trial becomes weary of life and in
[47:16] multiple places he said God is coming
[47:18] against him and and it feels it's
[47:21] without cause and that this trial has no
[47:24] purpose God's doing it just because he's
[47:27] God he's just doing it because he's God
[47:29] and he can be mean that's that's the
[47:31] reason he's doing
[47:32] it God's doing it because he's God job's
[47:35] purpose and plans are shattered in verse
[47:38] 17:1 it says job's purpose and plans are
[47:41] shattered and and you know sometimes you
[47:43] can be going headlong and you've got
[47:45] your plan you've got your purpose you've
[47:47] got your vision and and you're walking
[47:50] towards you you're moving towards it and
[47:52] then all of a sudden it's just like
[47:53] someone takes the rug and just rips it
[47:55] out from under you and and then and then
[47:57] stands back and laughs at you right and
[48:00] these are all the things you can feel in
[48:02] a trial and and so uh 1716 it's job says
[48:07] his hope is gone uh 1911 job says God
[48:11] has counted him among his enemies this
[48:13] is how job's feeling through his trial
[48:16] chapter 19 job describes feeling alone
[48:19] abandoned and desolate and one of the
[48:21] things you know I thought of was Jesus
[48:23] on the cross cried out my God my God why
[48:25] hast Thou forsaken me we know that David
[48:28] said the same thing prophesying that
[48:30] that those words and and I think as
[48:33] Christians we all we can all go I think
[48:35] we all go through those times where we
[48:36] just we step back and we say my God my
[48:39] God why have you forsaken me I don't
[48:42] understand this lord it's too heavy
[48:45] verse uh I believe it's 15 and chapter
[48:47] 19 job says I am full of confusion wow I
[48:51] am full of
[48:53] confusion job in his confusion
[48:57] he he
[48:59] says he says if I could just speak with
[49:02] God so job's going through this trial
[49:05] and he and he just doesn't feel like
[49:07] he's connected with God at all he he's
[49:09] God where are you where are you in this
[49:12] trial I if I could just the tri fine
[49:15] take me through the trial but if I could
[49:17] just hear from you and
[49:19] yet it's like God just goes silent and
[49:23] it's the worst feeling yes it is it's
[49:25] the worst feeling to feel you're going
[49:28] through a trial and and the one who who
[49:30] is is supposed to be there to comfort
[49:32] you the one who's there that you're
[49:34] looking for answers from it's it's like
[49:37] he's just
[49:38] silent and it's and it's heavy it's a
[49:40] it's a heavy burden to bear it and and
[49:44] it and and your your emotions and it's
[49:46] one thing to be down physically but then
[49:48] spiritually you can be down and
[49:50] emotionally you can be down and and
[49:52] mentally you can be down and then you
[49:54] dip into depression and and it's and
[49:56] it's just an awful state to be in and
[49:59] and by the way you're responding I know
[50:01] that you're relating to to to job to
[50:04] myself and to each
[50:05] other and I and I think friends I think
[50:08] that many times we we we want to be
[50:12] spiritual we want to be strong and yet
[50:14] there's times in life when we're just
[50:16] not and I think and I think that that's
[50:19] okay and I think that we shouldn't put
[50:21] on a front I I in fact I don't when
[50:24] you're when you're in the depths of it
[50:25] it's just like God said says you can try
[50:27] but you're not going to put on a front
[50:28] this time no matter how much you want to
[50:31] seem strong to everyone around you
[50:33] you're just you're going to be you're
[50:34] going to be weak right now and we know
[50:36] that in our weakness he's made strong
[50:39] and and that's hard to understand and
[50:40] it's hard to accept but yet through the
[50:43] trials of life and through our
[50:45] weaknesses he's made
[50:49] strong job and his absolute confusion
[50:52] says if I could just speak to God if I
[50:55] if I knew where he was right I would
[50:57] walk up to his to his door and I would
[51:00] knock on the door and I would say God I
[51:02] need to talk to
[51:03] you but but he he didn't feel he
[51:06] couldn't find that place and so because
[51:08] he couldn't find that place himself job
[51:10] actually says if there was just a
[51:12] mediator if there was somebody that I
[51:15] knew that could put their hand on me and
[51:17] put their hand on God and just mediate
[51:19] for us and I believe that job was
[51:21] looking ahead to see Jesus Christ on
[51:23] this Earth to know that there's one
[51:25] mediator between God and man and that's
[51:27] Jesus Christ there's a high priest of
[51:29] our that of our profession there's he he
[51:32] knows your Affliction he can be touched
[51:34] by the feeling of your infirmity and
[51:37] even when you don't feel like it he's
[51:39] touched by the feeling of your infirmity
[51:41] and I'm just I just feel compelled to
[51:43] say this now I wanted to say it later
[51:45] but if you watch The Book of Job I in in
[51:48] the first two chapters you'll find that
[51:50] God was fully aware what was going on
[51:53] with job Satan came to God and and God
[51:57] said where are you going where did you
[51:58] come from where are you going and he
[52:00] says have you considered this is God
[52:03] have you considered my servant job have
[52:06] you considered this man have you
[52:08] considered this woman have you
[52:10] considered this
[52:11] child have you considered him
[52:14] Satan and and you know Satan says well
[52:17] yeah but you know look look of course
[52:20] any man will be that way look at you got
[52:22] a hedge around
[52:23] him and so then he he afflicts J then we
[52:27] have the the the first day all this is
[52:29] taken from
[52:32] job and then it says that Satan came
[52:36] back and God says hey have you
[52:39] considered
[52:40] job job is completely unaware what is
[52:43] going on in this other
[52:45] dimension I I believe that job would hey
[52:49] wait wait a second Lord I'd like to be
[52:52] uh can we have a meeting
[52:54] here but God says have you considered my
[52:57] servant job again the second time and
[52:59] then Satan says well yeah but a life for
[53:01] a life I mean look at you I mean any man
[53:05] this is this is external stuff but you
[53:07] touch let me touch his flesh he'll curse
[53:09] you and God says okay you can touch him
[53:13] take him as far as you want to go but
[53:15] you can't take his life glory and so it
[53:17] doesn't matter what the trial is there's
[53:20] a there's a point Satan can only go so
[53:22] far and he might he might flirt on that
[53:24] line but God is watching in the whole
[53:28] time and I and I know that Satan knows
[53:31] he can't cross that line God's just
[53:33] watching him God's God's sitting there
[53:35] and he's just all eyes on job and he's
[53:38] watching glory and Satan can I come down
[53:41] here yeah it's Thursday night I'll wake
[53:44] you
[53:45] up and I imagine Satan's just
[53:48] walking and he's just touching job you
[53:52] going through a trial right now you
[53:53] don't got to answer
[53:55] that and he just he just touches job and
[53:58] he's taken him so far and then he looks
[54:02] back to see if God's watching just cuz
[54:04] he wants to take him just as far as he
[54:07] can but he turns and look and God's
[54:09] watching him the whole time burning a
[54:11] hole right in the back of Satan say I'm
[54:14] watching you watching you buddy so if
[54:16] you're going through a trial just know
[54:18] he can only go so far amen glory
[54:26] amen amen that's good so in this state
[54:31] of job feeling this way of going through
[54:33] this trial of trying to find
[54:36] God in from stage left comes three
[54:41] friends three friends and you know you
[54:44] look at it and you just want how in the
[54:46] world can you call them friends but I
[54:48] was thinking about this and it just I'm
[54:50] I'm just going to go this way if it's
[54:51] okay tonight I just trust the Lord here
[54:55] but you know it's it's uh these These
[54:59] are men that that they sat with each
[55:02] other they laughed with each other they
[55:04] fellowshipped with each other they they
[55:07] they talked about deep things of God
[55:10] together and And yet when you're reading
[55:13] job job and his friends if I could just
[55:16] bring it to speak maybe our speak our
[55:18] language they could they could talk
[55:20] message talk right they could talk the
[55:23] scripture they could of course they
[55:25] didn't have a Bible then but you know
[55:27] I'm just putting it in our terms they
[55:28] could talk the word they could talk the
[55:30] message of the hour they could talk
[55:32] these things they could talk the talk
[55:33] and they could walk the walk they knew
[55:36] quotes they knew scriptures but yet they
[55:39] through the whole book They're swinging
[55:40] it at each other they're using the
[55:42] precious word of God to bring harm to
[55:45] one another they're just swinging it
[55:47] left and right and they cut this way and
[55:49] cut coming back and and you know really
[55:52] um no just when you look at it um if I
[55:56] can say it this way it's it's
[55:59] really I just thought you know this is a
[56:02] bunch of old guys sitting around talking
[56:04] about who knows more than the other one
[56:07] right is that okay yeah
[56:10] okay they really had a time though of
[56:13] telling each other what each others knew
[56:16] I know this and I know this and I know
[56:18] that and bless God and you know it's
[56:22] just this back and forth and it's just
[56:25] like my goodness
[56:27] guys you should have more wisdom than
[56:30] this yeah stop and I imagine you know so
[56:34] any anyway but
[56:35] then one of job's friends and this is
[56:38] this is just what I labored in in in
[56:42] study
[56:45] and one of job's friends tells
[56:48] him he
[56:50] says and and I'm assuming he meant it
[56:52] more as a dream than a vision but he
[56:54] calls it the vision I think a vision of
[56:56] of the
[56:57] night has a dream or a vision and he
[56:59] tells job this job I'm going to tell you
[57:02] something
[57:04] now I had a vision for your
[57:08] life I I dreamed a dream and this job
[57:12] this is thus saith the Lord for
[57:15] you and it and it and
[57:19] it's we saw a prophet in our
[57:22] day and so we know the reverence of God
[57:26] for someone who has a gift of vision and
[57:28] prophecy we reverence that sure you
[57:31] don't want to argue with
[57:34] that and and understand I'm not talking
[57:36] about our Prophet now I'm just talking
[57:38] about that reverence for that gift that
[57:40] we can we can understand we can we can
[57:42] relate with that but then you have
[57:44] somebody come and say I had a dream for
[57:46] you I had a vision for you the spirit is
[57:50] leading me
[57:51] now and we can look at look at our day
[57:54] and the prophet in our day and everyone
[57:56] wanted a vision for them for for their
[57:59] life for their need I I have this need
[58:01] and if I could just get to brother
[58:03] brandom if I could if he' just see a
[58:05] vision and he could just tell me if he
[58:07] could just tell me what's going on in
[58:09] this trial if he could just give me
[58:10] direction what what decision do I make I
[58:14] and really it takes the faith out of
[58:15] your
[58:16] life
[58:18] right I know I know it's there to build
[58:20] Faith but you know I I if it we can just
[58:23] relate it back to the Jews you know lay
[58:26] lay on of hands and and seeking a sign
[58:28] and Jesus said a wicked and adulterous
[58:30] generation seeks a sign but yet you have
[58:33] a Roman Centurian come and he said Lord
[58:36] I'm not worthy for you to come in my
[58:37] house just speak the word and that's the
[58:40] way we know that that's the greater
[58:42] that's the greater faith is is just
[58:44] speak the word we just look to the word
[58:46] and that's and that's where our faith
[58:48] rests but we know that that men and
[58:52] women of that day became reliant on that
[58:54] gift they they had to see a vision
[58:56] and we're not exempt from that I think
[58:58] if we lived in that day we had that
[59:00] going on we it's easy to become ring
[59:03] on so we cannot start to understand this
[59:06] scenario here with job so what a fearful
[59:09] thing when he says the spirit is leading
[59:11] me I have thus sayith the Lord for you
[59:15] job but if you look at his vision if you
[59:18] look at this dream and if you look at
[59:19] you know the Spirit came to me in the
[59:21] night and the and the hair it stood up
[59:23] on my body it was just oh it was a
[59:26] fearful thing and and I don't mean to
[59:29] poke fun at this but when you start
[59:30] looking at what the spirit said to him
[59:33] first of all he couldn't make it out it
[59:35] was Fuzzy it was it was it wasn't clear
[59:38] and and it and it it was fearful but yet
[59:40] when it started speaking and and I in my
[59:44] Bible now they didn't have Bibles now
[59:46] but in my Bible when you take that back
[59:48] to the word there's there's anytime an
[59:51] angel came It Was Fear
[59:53] not I'm come from the Lord fear not not
[59:56] and it was a clear I I I could be wrong
[59:59] friends you can correct me afterwards
[1:00:01] but I don't remember any time in the
[1:00:02] scripture where someone says that was an
[1:00:04] angel of the Lord and I couldn't make
[1:00:05] out his
[1:00:07] figure Joshua saw a man he knew it was a
[1:00:10] man and his sword he had a sword in his
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:14] hand so it just the the vision was
[1:00:17] flawed and if job had a Bible I don't
[1:00:20] think he could take that Vision back to
[1:00:22] the word the things he was saying and
[1:00:25] and it it was something along the lines
[1:00:27] of God doesn't use man he can't trust
[1:00:29] him or something like that well we know
[1:00:30] that that's false because God uses man
[1:00:32] all the time even with his his his uh
[1:00:35] all his faults and failures so the
[1:00:38] vision just doesn't line up with God's
[1:00:40] word so you start to see this this image
[1:00:43] of this man coming and and he's he means
[1:00:46] well he's sincere but yet the whole
[1:00:48] thing is
[1:00:49] flawed are you with me yeah job's
[1:00:53] friends continually tell him he's not
[1:00:55] speaking or living the message true he's
[1:00:59] not speaking or living have you ever
[1:01:01] heard that before I can't I I mean if I
[1:01:04] went off of what people said I'm not a
[1:01:06] Christian because I've been told that so
[1:01:08] many times you're not a Christian you're
[1:01:10] not message enough and and I don't know
[1:01:13] where we get off thinking we can tell
[1:01:15] each other you don't have the Holy
[1:01:18] Ghost because we know that even Beyond a
[1:01:21] vision even Beyond a gift the gift of
[1:01:25] the Holy ghost is the greatest gift you
[1:01:27] can ever receive in your life the gift
[1:01:31] of the Holy Ghost that's what we're
[1:01:32] striving for that's what we're longing
[1:01:34] for that's what we want is the very
[1:01:36] spirit of God living in you leading you
[1:01:40] guiding you directing you fellowshipping
[1:01:42] with you when you don't feel him you
[1:01:44] know he's there because he's living in
[1:01:46] you the holy ghost means everything to
[1:01:49] us and yet if you have somebody
[1:01:52] especially somebody you have confidence
[1:01:54] in tell you well you don't have the Holy
[1:01:56] Ghost that'll set you back and I and I
[1:02:00] just I just don't agree with it I I that
[1:02:03] maybe that's just me personally but I
[1:02:04] just don't agree with
[1:02:06] that because there was a time in one of
[1:02:10] brother branham's meetings he was being
[1:02:12] criticized for the woman that was
[1:02:13] playing the piano it was a young girl
[1:02:16] and he said I know the way she's dressed
[1:02:18] he said I I wish she wouldn't wear that
[1:02:20] either but he said but you know you you
[1:02:22] come to her and you lash out and he said
[1:02:24] you might hinder what God's doing in her
[1:02:27] life to say she don't have the Holy
[1:02:28] Ghost you don't know
[1:02:30] that and you might hinder her and you
[1:02:33] might you might break her spirit by
[1:02:34] saying that you might break the work of
[1:02:37] God that he's doing in her life maybe
[1:02:38] she just hasn't come that far
[1:02:41] yet but yet we feel spiritual we I feel
[1:02:45] L of God to tell you you don't have the
[1:02:46] Holy Ghost have mercy
[1:02:49] Lord people are always seeking something
[1:02:52] spiritual I believe it's a pure desire
[1:02:55] most of the time
[1:02:56] time cuz I was thinking you know that
[1:02:58] that one man was chasing after Paul and
[1:03:01] uh I I forget who was with him at the
[1:03:03] time but they were chasing after Paul
[1:03:04] and he said hey how much how much for
[1:03:06] the Holy Ghost I'll pay you for it right
[1:03:09] and we know that he was just wanting to
[1:03:11] make gains off of doing the
[1:03:13] works and so that's why I say most of
[1:03:16] the time the desires P are you with me
[1:03:18] tonight is this okay
[1:03:31] okay I believe um people failed to
[1:03:35] understand the anointing God has placed
[1:03:37] in his church for the edification of his
[1:03:39] bride we know that there's a five-fold
[1:03:42] Ministry and there's different
[1:03:44] anointings there's different gifts in
[1:03:45] that fivefold and and each one has its
[1:03:48] place each one has its purpose and in
[1:03:51] Desiring the spiritual and the
[1:03:52] supernatural they'll call their Pastor
[1:03:55] who's the Ox of the team not spiritual
[1:03:57] enough because he's the ox and and this
[1:04:01] is this is just um somebody preached
[1:04:04] this at our church a while ago I can't
[1:04:06] somebody asked for the link I said hey
[1:04:08] I'd like to listen to that too so this
[1:04:10] is this is where some of this is coming
[1:04:12] from and in Desiring that and and so
[1:04:15] they look at their pastor and they say
[1:04:16] he's the ox of the team and the ox is
[1:04:18] down on the ground he's he's he's
[1:04:21] pushing he's pulling he's working and
[1:04:24] that doesn't seem very spiritual ual
[1:04:25] when the ox is full of
[1:04:28] sweat when he's tired after a long day
[1:04:31] it's it's not very fun it's not it's not
[1:04:34] very spiritual and so they'll look at
[1:04:36] the pastor and they'll say he's not
[1:04:37] spiritual enough he doesn't preach the
[1:04:39] word of the hour like brother so and so
[1:04:43] so he must not be he's there's something
[1:04:45] missing in his ministry and so it starts
[1:04:47] to make him unsettled and they start
[1:04:49] looking at at at other Ministries that
[1:04:52] are more spiritual and it's it's funny
[1:04:55] I'm finding this um even just as
[1:04:58] assistant pastor back home I just
[1:05:02] sometimes I think the Lord just gives me
[1:05:03] little taste to know what the pastor
[1:05:04] goes through I I I don't know but a
[1:05:07] pastor will preach a series for
[1:05:10] weeks and then the Evangelist comes and
[1:05:13] everyone in the congregation says oh my
[1:05:15] goodness I've never heard this
[1:05:18] before and the poor Pastor the poor ox
[1:05:21] has just spent months preaching the
[1:05:23] exact same thing
[1:05:25] but you know it's not as it's not as
[1:05:28] charismatic it's not as flat it's not as
[1:05:31] just coming through and and you know
[1:05:33] ripping tearing it's just it's it's the
[1:05:35] ox and he's taking his time and he's
[1:05:37] just he's he's laboring with you and
[1:05:40] he's making sure you know he's making
[1:05:42] sure you know that this this brother
[1:05:44] comes and this sister comes and he's
[1:05:45] just hey let's take oh nope wait we got
[1:05:48] to go back here we don't we not miss
[1:05:50] leaving any come on come on this way
[1:05:52] where the Evangelist is just like hey
[1:05:53] you get up or you get out you and he's
[1:05:56] just flying through the aisle and and
[1:05:58] you know but but poor Pastor you know
[1:06:01] he's just ax of the team and he's got to
[1:06:04] Bear it just keep keep trudging along
[1:06:06] but you know the Evangelist the teacher
[1:06:09] they get it's it's a higher uh it looks
[1:06:13] better it sounds more
[1:06:15] spiritual but it's different anointings
[1:06:18] yeah that's it and Paul Paul said that
[1:06:21] the Corinthian Church was comparing
[1:06:23] themselves amongst themselves and then
[1:06:26] called him carnal for doing it yeah so
[1:06:30] you know I understand that you know that
[1:06:32] was men maybe saying well I'm not this
[1:06:34] gift and I'm not that gift and so I'm
[1:06:36] not this I'm I'm not as good as this one
[1:06:38] but I'm better than this one and so
[1:06:39] there's carnal comparisons that way but
[1:06:41] yet you can have a congregation or or or
[1:06:44] the body of Christ around the world that
[1:06:46] you know they gravitate towards one
[1:06:48] Minister and that's fine but yet but yet
[1:06:51] are you with me okay felt a little stiff
[1:06:54] there
[1:06:57] but you know they'll gravitate towards
[1:06:58] one Minister because you know because
[1:07:00] he's better he's flashier and and and
[1:07:03] yet you leave what about the little guy
[1:07:05] over here that the he's a faithful
[1:07:07] Pastor he's a faithful Minister and he's
[1:07:10] and he's his reward will be just as
[1:07:11] great as the as the big name preachers
[1:07:13] and so you can have the body of Christ
[1:07:16] comparing men and well I got to have
[1:07:19] this one pray for me when brother bandam
[1:07:21] said if you just have your pastor pray
[1:07:22] for you you don't you can't get to your
[1:07:25] P have the sister pray for you she can
[1:07:28] lay you can lay hands on each other
[1:07:30] brothers you can lay hands on each
[1:07:32] other and so you know we just it's it's
[1:07:35] just this it's just something in human
[1:07:37] nature that we we gravitate towards
[1:07:39] these things we we we start
[1:07:43] comparing ministers and we compare you
[1:07:45] know we compare ourselves amongst
[1:07:47] ourselves and we ought not to the
[1:07:50] prophet called it carnal
[1:07:51] comparisons right Paul said one man SWS
[1:07:56] another Waters but God gives the
[1:07:58] increase so I don't care how good the
[1:08:01] ministry is over here or the ministry is
[1:08:04] over there or or this church compared to
[1:08:06] this church it's God gets the god gets
[1:08:09] the glory it's God who Waters it's God
[1:08:13] who who's who's bringing forth the life
[1:08:16] that's in the plant
[1:08:17] amen job's friends kept telling him he's
[1:08:20] got sin in his life job you got sin in
[1:08:24] your life there's something wrong you're
[1:08:26] not as spiritual as we are because
[1:08:27] you're going through this trial you've
[1:08:29] got to have something in your life
[1:08:32] there's got there's something wrong
[1:08:33] somewhere they assume the role of God
[1:08:36] and boldly declare that God is doing
[1:08:38] what what God is doing in job's life
[1:08:41] overriding God's ability to to speak to
[1:08:43] job to himself it just moneyed the
[1:08:45] waters I know job felt like God you're
[1:08:47] not speaking to me but then his friends
[1:08:49] start speaking and it just made things
[1:08:53] muddy job's trial if you read the book
[1:08:57] job's trial was not because of sin and
[1:09:00] his friends were
[1:09:03] wrong why and I just asked myself why do
[1:09:06] we as mortal humans gravitate towards
[1:09:09] the negative towards something like that
[1:09:11] well there's sin in your life why do we
[1:09:13] gravitate towards that way someone
[1:09:16] sinned and that's why they don't have
[1:09:17] the Holy Ghost and that's
[1:09:20] why that explains it is it because we're
[1:09:24] putting it as something we think we can
[1:09:26] control or something that we can do in
[1:09:29] it now I know you you if you haven't
[1:09:32] realized this you can't give yourself
[1:09:35] anything from
[1:09:38] God the scripture says who can add one
[1:09:41] cubit to his stature by
[1:09:44] trying sis I want you to be seven foot
[1:09:47] tall can you do that tomorrow tomorrow
[1:09:51] morning it's 8 now you got 12 hours make
[1:09:54] yourself 7 foot tall you couldn't do it
[1:09:57] you could try you could just you know
[1:10:00] stand in the shower watering and throw
[1:10:02] fertilizer at your feet and you'll never
[1:10:04] be seven foot tall not by tomorrow
[1:10:09] anyway but what what can who can add one
[1:10:13] cubit to his stature who can who can
[1:10:15] give themsel the Holy Ghost and and and
[1:10:20] now oh help me you know we we know that
[1:10:24] there's things you got to hunger and
[1:10:25] thirst and but you can't even give
[1:10:27] yourself that hunger and
[1:10:29] thirst that has to come from God oh yeah
[1:10:33] hunger and thirst I I want you to be in
[1:10:35] church every time the doors are open
[1:10:37] well you have to have a hunger and
[1:10:38] thirst to be in church every time the
[1:10:40] doors are open and and the minister the
[1:10:43] pastor the minister can't give that to
[1:10:44] you you can't give it to yourself I
[1:10:47] think you can pray you can certainly
[1:10:50] pray God I don't I'm I this is missing
[1:10:52] in my life and you you have to go to the
[1:10:54] one who can give it to
[1:10:56] you if ye as fathers and mothers know
[1:11:00] how to give your children good gifts if
[1:11:01] you know how to give your nieces and
[1:11:03] nephew's good gifts how much more your
[1:11:05] heavenly father and then Jesus says how
[1:11:08] much more the he the Holy Ghost PR the
[1:11:11] Lord so we know we've heard these things
[1:11:13] you seek it you you seek and you shall
[1:11:16] find you got to seek it you got to get
[1:11:17] hungry for it you have to stay at the
[1:11:19] altar well you cannot oh
[1:11:23] boy you can't stay at the altar 24 hours
[1:11:27] a day 7 days a week until you feel like
[1:11:30] you've got the Holy Ghost the the the
[1:11:32] wind comes where it listeth and who can
[1:11:34] tell where it way it went and so so you
[1:11:37] know the the man that was I I this is
[1:11:41] completely
[1:11:44] free the the man was was seeking God he
[1:11:47] was seeking what his wife had and it was
[1:11:49] just brother Bram said well brother the
[1:11:52] the moment that you picked up that
[1:11:53] pamphlet and you couldn't get away from
[1:11:55] it that was God dealing with you and he
[1:11:57] said you mean I've had it this whole
[1:12:00] time and he said yeah how
[1:12:04] simple how simple and yet we complicate
[1:12:07] it we we you know that's why I I think
[1:12:10] you know we we gravitate towards the
[1:12:12] negative because well you don't have the
[1:12:14] Holy Ghost well you just got to stay
[1:12:15] there till you get it well you just gave
[1:12:18] them something to do oh yeah and if it's
[1:12:21] a gift you don't do anything for a gift
[1:12:25] I hope this is this okay brother
[1:12:29] okay deacons if I'm off just start
[1:12:32] waving your hands
[1:12:34] and close the
[1:12:36] service but it's just it's just
[1:12:39] something that I it's it's it's a burden
[1:12:41] on my heart because young people young
[1:12:44] people and old but especially young
[1:12:47] people when they're told you know you
[1:12:48] you don't have this you need this and
[1:12:50] and now I I do believe God put a pastor
[1:12:53] in your life and I believe that God can
[1:12:55] speak through a man of God to you but I
[1:12:58] think I think as men of God we can we we
[1:13:01] can give oursel too much Liberty to tell
[1:13:04] you what you need and what you don't
[1:13:06] need when God's the one who can tell you
[1:13:09] that you don't need to come up here in a
[1:13:12] prayer line and me tell you what you
[1:13:13] have need of God can speak to you
[1:13:15] through the preaching of the word that's
[1:13:17] how that's how he does it I mean that's
[1:13:20] the intent is it not while while Peter
[1:13:23] yet spake these words amen friends I
[1:13:26] feel the Holy Ghost here cuz I did not
[1:13:30] have any of
[1:13:33] this so I just pray I pray you receive I
[1:13:36] pray you receive God bless
[1:13:42] you
[1:13:45] amen we are all over
[1:13:59] Lord you know this is another statement
[1:14:01] that I don't I think we throw around too
[1:14:03] much is well you just need
[1:14:05] faith I'm sorry but again you'll just
[1:14:08] you'll just crush somebody who's who's
[1:14:11] trying to believe who's who's praying
[1:14:14] who's who's ask who's seeking god well
[1:14:16] you just need Faith yeah I just think we
[1:14:20] got to be careful because that crushes
[1:14:22] somebody's spirit and and then what you
[1:14:24] know you might be responsible someday
[1:14:26] for them giving
[1:14:28] up it's it's brother bham said it's our
[1:14:31] attitude our attitude can determine
[1:14:33] their outcome can determine their
[1:14:35] destination and so we have to be careful
[1:14:37] with our attitude we have to be careful
[1:14:39] with our knowledge we have to be careful
[1:14:41] when somebody new comes into the
[1:14:43] congregation comes to visit we have to
[1:14:46] be careful how are you looking at them
[1:14:48] how are you how are you talking how are
[1:14:50] you interacting do they feel welcome
[1:14:51] here
[1:14:58] I want to read
[1:15:00] John John chapter
[1:15:03] n can can you pull that up well I'll
[1:15:06] just keep turning John chapter 9 verse
[1:15:18] one John chapter 9 verse
[1:15:21] one are you with me tonight amen
[1:15:28] and as Jesus passed by he saw a man
[1:15:31] which was blind from his
[1:15:33] birth and a and his disciples asked him
[1:15:36] saying master who did Sin this man or
[1:15:39] his parents that he was born blind so
[1:15:43] here's that thinking again yeah this
[1:15:45] man's this man's blind because somebody
[1:15:48] somewhere sinned yeah this is Jesus's
[1:15:51] response Jesus answered neither hath
[1:15:53] this man sinned nor has par but this is
[1:15:56] the reason he's blind that the works of
[1:15:59] God should be made manifest in him I
[1:16:02] must work the works of him that sent me
[1:16:05] while it is day the night cometh when no
[1:16:07] man can work so Jesus is saying this man
[1:16:11] is blind because God is going to get the
[1:16:13] glory praise the Lord and the man was
[1:16:15] healed yeah so I just bring this out to
[1:16:18] say you know we gravitate towards those
[1:16:20] things they don't have this they did
[1:16:22] this this this is in their life and yet
[1:16:24] Jesus
[1:16:26] Jesus argue with this I mean my Bible
[1:16:29] this is in
[1:16:31] red Jesus said nobody sinned this is
[1:16:35] that God would be
[1:16:37] glorified and then you have a young
[1:16:39] woman in a wheelchair sitting in the
[1:16:41] services and she's a Wallflower for the
[1:16:44] Lord bringing God glory sitting in a
[1:16:45] wheelchair well wouldn't wouldn't
[1:16:48] jumping up out of the wheelchair and
[1:16:50] running the aisles wouldn't that bring
[1:16:52] God the most glory and yet her attitude
[1:16:55] sitting in a wheelchair brought God
[1:16:57] glory
[1:17:00] that's there are elements of God let me
[1:17:09] just you know the blind man he couldn't
[1:17:12] help being blind his parents couldn't
[1:17:14] help him there was an appointed time and
[1:17:17] purpose for him to be
[1:17:19] healed there's an there was an appointed
[1:17:21] time for you to accept Christ and be
[1:17:24] filled with his spirit I believe and
[1:17:26] only God knows when that
[1:17:29] is yes sir now this is a quote says
[1:17:32] nothing you can do God already did it
[1:17:35] and you just have to accept it and by
[1:17:38] Sovereign Grace believe it not just just
[1:17:41] have faith your faith the scripture says
[1:17:44] is a gift and a gift from God it's
[1:17:47] Sovereign Grace that gives you Faith to
[1:17:50] believe oh my I
[1:17:52] just wor
[1:18:00] Matthew 16:18 you don't have to turn
[1:18:02] there I'm just going to reference a
[1:18:04] story it's been something burning in my
[1:18:06] heart and I just if if the Lord will
[1:18:08] help me this will all make sense by the
[1:18:10] time we're
[1:18:11] done Matthew 16:18 jesus takes his
[1:18:14] disciples to cir
[1:18:16] Philippi cere Philippi is is um at the
[1:18:21] at Mount HB I think and and at this
[1:18:27] mountain the the the Heathen the Greeks
[1:18:31] the the Romans they've set up shrines on
[1:18:34] this mountain because in this mountain
[1:18:36] there's a there's a cave and in the
[1:18:39] wintertime I think I don't know if the
[1:18:41] waters come out or recede in the spring
[1:18:43] the waters flow and so people in their
[1:18:46] nature to you know have something
[1:18:49] spiritual have something that they can
[1:18:50] do in it they believed that this was a
[1:18:53] gate to the world right that that the
[1:18:57] God and it became the god of fertility
[1:18:59] that they worshiped here and they did
[1:19:01] unspeakable
[1:19:03] things um and and I just we'll just
[1:19:08] leave it at that it became the epicenter
[1:19:11] of pagan worship of the worst kind true
[1:19:15] and yet Jesus brings his
[1:19:18] disciples to this
[1:19:22] place there Jesus Jesus asked who does
[1:19:26] man say that I
[1:19:27] am and then he asks well who do you say
[1:19:30] that I am so Jesus is standing among
[1:19:33] pagan gods in the Pagan place of worship
[1:19:37] in the middle of sexual disgraceful
[1:19:40] acts Jesus goes where no other person
[1:19:43] who's following Jehovah would go not
[1:19:46] only by himself but he brings disciples
[1:19:48] with
[1:19:50] him he steps into the worst of sin I
[1:19:54] want you to catch this because wherever
[1:19:57] you're at tonight Jesus steps into the
[1:19:59] worst of sin to speak the word of what
[1:20:03] was prevailing power over sin and the
[1:20:07] enemy now in this
[1:20:09] place this gate to the
[1:20:12] underworld it's actually called the
[1:20:14] gates of hell right right and it's here
[1:20:18] that Jesus says Upon This Rock I'll
[1:20:20] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:20:22] will not Prevail against it so Jesus
[1:20:25] brings his disciples to this place of
[1:20:28] the worst kind that's called the gates
[1:20:30] of hell and he says the Gates of Hell
[1:20:33] will not Prevail against it so I you
[1:20:35] know I was just reminded as I was
[1:20:37] looking at this that the rock that I'll
[1:20:39] build my church is the rock of
[1:20:41] Revelation and upon Revelation the Gates
[1:20:44] of Hell cannot Prevail against the
[1:20:46] Revelation that God has given
[1:20:49] you Jesus Jesus says his church is going
[1:20:52] to be built on this now I'm quoting now
[1:20:54] Satan tries to destroy confidence in the
[1:20:56] word but when she believes the bride
[1:20:59] believes uh disbelieves Satan and
[1:21:02] believes the spirit's revelation of the
[1:21:04] word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:21:06] against her it's the revelation of God
[1:21:09] that gives you authority over the devil
[1:21:12] so it's through that Revelation and and
[1:21:15] and and we could say Revelation is is is
[1:21:18] Faith and how do you get Faith Faith
[1:21:20] cometh by the hearing of the word so
[1:21:22] when you come to
[1:21:23] church and the word is coming forth
[1:21:26] you're being ministered Revelation
[1:21:28] you're in that channel that God can
[1:21:31] speak to you and that God can give you
[1:21:33] Faith you're in that channel that God
[1:21:36] can give you prevailing overcoming power
[1:21:39] that Satan cannot th he has no he's
[1:21:42] powerless against it God is instilling
[1:21:45] he's giving you that gift I I I'm just
[1:21:48] trying to say it in as many ways as I
[1:21:50] can to get it to you and the Gates of
[1:21:52] Hell shall not Prevail against it
[1:21:56] amen but it's it's
[1:22:02] um it's it's you know Satan tries to
[1:22:04] destroy confidence in the
[1:22:07] word and he'll do that through many
[1:22:09] forms now I just read you a quote now
[1:22:11] remember this Christ is in the true
[1:22:13] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:22:15] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:22:18] how that the Antichrist Spirit would
[1:22:19] come into the church and defile it
[1:22:21] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:22:24] it exposes Satan revealing his works the
[1:22:27] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:22:29] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:22:32] down to the time that he's cast in the
[1:22:33] Lake of Fire now I want you to to put
[1:22:36] this in with the story of job job is is
[1:22:40] is in a trial and he's in the lowest
[1:22:42] point of his life spiritually
[1:22:44] emotionally physically and and here
[1:22:47] comes these friends and they're speaking
[1:22:49] things that's discrediting the word of
[1:22:51] God in job's life are you with me
[1:22:56] it's discrediting it it's it's it's
[1:22:58] causing destruction to job it's it's
[1:23:00] bringing him down it's it's it's
[1:23:03] fighting against job and his walk with
[1:23:06] the Lord are are you with
[1:23:09] me Satan fights that he cannot stand it
[1:23:12] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:23:14] revelation of the true church and what
[1:23:16] she is what she stands for and that she
[1:23:19] can do the Greater Works she will be an
[1:23:21] invincible Army now I think so many
[1:23:23] times we get caught up on the Greater
[1:23:25] Works that we leave off the the
[1:23:27] Revelation that we leave off the the
[1:23:30] relationship with Jesus
[1:23:33] Christ if they get a true revelation of
[1:23:35] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:23:37] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:23:40] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:23:43] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:23:45] prise the Lord he will be as definitely
[1:23:47] thed today as when Christ withstood his
[1:23:50] every effort to gain the power over him
[1:23:52] in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation
[1:23:55] but we love it with true Revelation in
[1:23:57] our lives the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:24:00] Prevail against us but we Prevail over
[1:24:03] them now if you think back to the
[1:24:05] scriptures that we read at the beginning
[1:24:07] it talked about the the gates and how
[1:24:09] God would he would break the gates he
[1:24:11] would hear them in their distress and
[1:24:13] and even in their sins he would hear
[1:24:15] their cry he would deliver
[1:24:17] them thank you Jesus the Gates of Hell
[1:24:21] cannot Prevail against you but you'll
[1:24:23] Prevail against them
[1:24:25] job's friends were sincere though they
[1:24:28] were sincerely wrong right God gets
[1:24:32] angry at them and I wonder if if God
[1:24:35] became so angry at them that is because
[1:24:39] job became so
[1:24:41] confused it was driving job into
[1:24:44] discouragement and hindering job's faith
[1:24:46] in God that's good now are you with me
[1:24:51] yeah the definition of deceive
[1:24:54] is a person causing another person to
[1:24:57] believe something that's not true
[1:24:59] typically in order to gain some personal
[1:25:03] Advantage it also means giving a
[1:25:05] mistaken impression so these these men
[1:25:09] are giving job a mistaken impression of
[1:25:12] God they're they're they're trying to
[1:25:15] get some personal advantage over him and
[1:25:18] I could just say it was like it was just
[1:25:20] a pride thing I know more than you job I
[1:25:24] I I've got more than you I've got more
[1:25:26] I've got you know if they talk like us
[1:25:28] I've got a closer relationship with the
[1:25:30] Lord than you and it and it was just it
[1:25:33] was in job's lowest time so it was just
[1:25:36] Heap on Heap on Heap and it was just
[1:25:38] just breaking job down in Proverbs 6
[1:25:43] says these six things do the Lord hate
[1:25:46] yay seven are an Abomination unto him a
[1:25:49] proud look a lying tongue
[1:25:54] and hands that shed innocent
[1:25:56] blood and heart that deviseth Wicked
[1:25:59] imaginations feet that be Swift and
[1:26:02] running to
[1:26:03] mischief and then the
[1:26:05] seventh uh sorry the sixth the false
[1:26:08] witness that speaks lies I mean you
[1:26:10] could just stick job's friends names
[1:26:11] right in this and then the seventh that
[1:26:15] is an is an Abomination unto God he that
[1:26:18] Seth Discord among the
[1:26:22] Brethren now when
[1:26:27] are are we okay I know I'm like jam
[1:26:29] packing like we could stop and pick it
[1:26:32] up again some other
[1:26:34] time
[1:26:36] um
[1:26:45] wow let me let me just
[1:26:52] go let's just go just a little a little
[1:26:54] bit
[1:26:57] further in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:27:00] revealed uh brother brandom speaks
[1:27:02] plainly to the church that Satan won't
[1:27:04] leave them as a loving group and I've
[1:27:06] and I've spoken this before I just this
[1:27:08] is this is one of my favorite uh quotes
[1:27:11] and because I just I I feel that strong
[1:27:15] urge when when brother Brenham says stay
[1:27:17] with your pastor he's ordained to lead
[1:27:19] you
[1:27:20] through I feel strong about that
[1:27:25] but Satan won't leave you a loving group
[1:27:26] he gives warning brother Bram gives
[1:27:28] warning to pray when you see a spirit
[1:27:30] rising up in the church to cause
[1:27:31] division so many people uh uh take a
[1:27:35] spirit of bitterness and hatred and
[1:27:37] speak evil and and and especially
[1:27:39] towards the pastor and it's just a
[1:27:42] spirit brother Bram warned that will
[1:27:45] that doing that had taking that spirit
[1:27:47] and and being that way having that in
[1:27:48] your heart and and even towards one
[1:27:51] another he says it'll drive the spirit
[1:27:53] from your
[1:27:54] life it'll drive the spirit from your
[1:27:58] church and it'll hurt your
[1:28:03] pastor I'm just going to reference these
[1:28:05] for time Matthew 7 Jesus speaking says
[1:28:08] beware of false prophets outwardly look
[1:28:11] like sheep but in their hearts they are
[1:28:13] wolves then he says you'll know them by
[1:28:16] the fruit they produce yeah once again
[1:28:19] Jesus says a man that hears his words
[1:28:21] and does them is is like a man who
[1:28:23] builds build his house on a rock which
[1:28:26] we just spoke about
[1:28:28] Revelation Matthew 10 and verse 16 Jesus
[1:28:32] says that he's he's sending them into
[1:28:35] the midst of these types of
[1:28:37] wolves and it and you he sends you into
[1:28:40] the midst of these wolves for the trying
[1:28:42] of your
[1:28:44] faith because you can watch and
[1:28:48] something will rise up and you say huh
[1:28:50] that that's that's a little strange
[1:28:52] that's a little off I don't know what it
[1:28:53] is but I can just I can just tell that's
[1:28:55] a little
[1:28:57] off don't you don't have to say anything
[1:28:59] about it just pray about it and and by
[1:29:02] their fruits you shall know them when it
[1:29:04] bears fruit then you'll know whether
[1:29:06] your discernment was right or not acts
[1:29:09] 2027 to 32 Paul telling the pastors To
[1:29:13] Be watchful over over yourself and the
[1:29:16] flock God has made them overseers over
[1:29:19] because he says Grievious wolves were
[1:29:21] will enter in and and not have any
[1:29:23] regard for the people but these men of
[1:29:25] the same faith will speak perverse
[1:29:27] things trying to draw away innocent
[1:29:29] lives to
[1:29:31] themselves this is all are you seeing
[1:29:33] how this is this is starting to come
[1:29:35] together with the scriptures we've been
[1:29:36] reading the quotes we've been
[1:29:38] reading and and I just I just pray it'll
[1:29:41] it'll just settle in your hearts because
[1:29:43] I I I'm going to have to skip some of
[1:29:45] this but I just I just want to make a
[1:29:47] strong point hopefully at the
[1:29:50] end Paul says watch and pray but rely on
[1:29:53] God's word and Grace that is able to
[1:29:55] build you and strengthen you and bring
[1:29:57] you into this inheritance that is
[1:29:59] preached to you thank you he says you're
[1:30:01] the purchase of God's blood and he
[1:30:04] doesn't take that lightly
[1:30:08] amen through the through the church
[1:30:11] ages God is speaking to his church and
[1:30:14] he's telling them that there's there's
[1:30:16] deceitful Spirit the spirit of the
[1:30:18] Antichrist is going to rise up in in
[1:30:21] your midst and he says and I hate the
[1:30:23] thing amen I hate God says I hate
[1:30:26] anything that would deceive you that
[1:30:28] would discourage you he says it's better
[1:30:30] that a millstone be hung about
[1:30:32] somebody's neck then you'd be
[1:30:34] offended that's how that's how much God
[1:30:38] this is this is the point I want to make
[1:30:41] that's how much God has his watchful
[1:30:43] care over you than Satan can go so far
[1:30:46] but God's watching him burning a hole
[1:30:49] right through his back he could he might
[1:30:51] be able to bring something and it and it
[1:30:53] disrupts the Church it disrupts the
[1:30:55] function it disrupts what we enjoy
[1:30:57] amongst each other the love that we feel
[1:31:00] it disrupts that but you just stay in
[1:31:02] watch it and you pray and God's watching
[1:31:03] it the whole time it can only go so far
[1:31:06] it can only be so comfortable before it
[1:31:08] either comes and be one of you or it
[1:31:10] leaves you
[1:31:12] right right that's that's the point I
[1:31:15] wanted to make God so now I feel like we
[1:31:17] can close in just a minute praise the
[1:31:20] Lord Proverbs 16:2 the ways of a man are
[1:31:23] clean in his own own eyes but the Lord
[1:31:25] weighs the
[1:31:27] spirit Jeremiah 17:10 the Lord searches
[1:31:30] the heart and the mind to give every man
[1:31:32] according to his ways and the fruit of
[1:31:34] his
[1:31:35] deeds help Jesus Revelations 2:23 says I
[1:31:39] am he that searches the mind and the
[1:31:41] heart and rewards
[1:31:44] accordingly and then we can have
[1:31:46] confidence because he
[1:31:48] says the spirit of deception the spirit
[1:31:51] of the Antichrist will be so close that
[1:31:54] had deceive the very elect but then he
[1:31:56] throws in that little thing there his
[1:31:58] watch his his ever loving care over you
[1:32:02] if it were
[1:32:03] possible that doesn't mean that doesn't
[1:32:05] mean that you take really what he's
[1:32:09] saying is it would deceive the very
[1:32:11] elect but it's
[1:32:13] impossible you can't be
[1:32:15] deceived God God is in his watchful
[1:32:18] cares watching he was watching over job
[1:32:21] the whole time and and and let's just
[1:32:24] let's just let me skip this I just want
[1:32:26] to go to the end
[1:32:29] here job 427 to9 after the Lord had said
[1:32:33] these things to job I mean job God let
[1:32:37] job have it he job stand up stand up be
[1:32:43] a man we're going to have a
[1:32:45] conversation you've done enough talking
[1:32:47] by the way it's my turn and God just you
[1:32:51] know just gives him a spanking
[1:32:55] yeah but after that after that I want
[1:32:58] you to catch this after the Lord had
[1:33:00] said these things to job he turns to
[1:33:03] job's friend now I didn't know I didn't
[1:33:05] think to look which one this was might
[1:33:06] have been the first one who said job I
[1:33:08] had a I had a vision for your life might
[1:33:10] have been him I don't know but he turn
[1:33:13] God turns to him and says I am angry
[1:33:15] with you and your two friends because
[1:33:17] you have not spoken the truth about me
[1:33:20] as my servant job has so now take take
[1:33:24] seven bulls and seven
[1:33:25] Rams go to my servant job and sacrifice
[1:33:29] a burnt offering for yourself what's he
[1:33:31] saying go repent right go repent to
[1:33:35] job my servant job will then pray for
[1:33:38] you right right and I will accept his
[1:33:40] prayer and not deal with you according
[1:33:42] to your Folly so in other words God was
[1:33:45] going to deal with these men but he says
[1:33:47] if you go have job pray for you I I have
[1:33:51] mercy you have not spoken this is the
[1:33:54] second time he says it you've not spoken
[1:33:56] the truth about me as my servant job has
[1:33:59] so eles the Tonite bildad the Shu
[1:34:01] shuhite and zofar the nthite did what
[1:34:05] the Lord told them and the Lord accepted
[1:34:07] job's
[1:34:08] prayer now notice this these men come
[1:34:12] they mean well they're sincere but God
[1:34:15] is furious with what they just
[1:34:18] did sowing Discord among Brethren
[1:34:22] deceiving somebody discouraging somebody
[1:34:25] God has zero tolerance for it prise God
[1:34:28] and he says repent and then have them
[1:34:31] pray for you yeah now we know that
[1:34:33] brother brandham said pray for that
[1:34:36] person that they'll either then they'll
[1:34:38] either go out or come among you
[1:34:41] okay
[1:34:45] so
[1:34:49] job let's see so so then God says go
[1:34:52] have job pray for you now I just want to
[1:34:54] get this you can you can stand to your
[1:34:56] feet cuz I'm going to have to be
[1:35:12] done let me just read this Matthew 5:44
[1:35:15] to 46 ye have heard that it hath been
[1:35:18] said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[1:35:20] hate thine enemy but I say unto you love
[1:35:23] your enemies bless them that curse you
[1:35:25] do good to them that hate you and pray
[1:35:27] for them which despitefully use you and
[1:35:30] persecute you now that takes some
[1:35:32] maturity yes it does that ye may be the
[1:35:35] children of your father which is in
[1:35:37] heaven for ye for he maketh his son to
[1:35:41] rise on the evil and on the good and
[1:35:42] sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust
[1:35:45] for if you love them which love you what
[1:35:48] reward have ye do not even the publicans
[1:35:51] the same and if you salute your brethren
[1:35:53] only
[1:35:54] what do ye more than others do not even
[1:35:56] the publicans so be ye therefore perfect
[1:36:00] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:36:02] is perfect does this mean it's going to
[1:36:04] be easy every time absolutely
[1:36:06] not tell you that absolutely
[1:36:09] not when job prayed for his
[1:36:13] friends the ones who deceived
[1:36:16] him in 42:10 it says God restored job
[1:36:21] with twice as much as he had before
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:26] go have job pray for you job prays
[1:36:29] probably not feeling like he really
[1:36:31] wanted
[1:36:32] to especially after being rebuked by God
[1:36:35] but right after he prayed the next verse
[1:36:38] says that God restored him with twice as
[1:36:40] much as he had lost the
[1:36:43] Lord
[1:36:50] amen job 34
[1:36:54] eliu speaking his eyes are on the ways
[1:36:56] of Mortals he sees their every step
[1:36:59] there's no deep Shadow no utter Darkness
[1:37:01] where evildoers can hide God has no need
[1:37:04] to examine people further that they
[1:37:07] should come before him for judgment
[1:37:09] without inquiry he shatters the mighty
[1:37:11] and sets up others in their places
[1:37:14] because he takes note of their deeds God
[1:37:16] is always watching he's got an
[1:37:18] everpresent eye an Ever watchful
[1:37:21] eye in our lowest time s God's there he
[1:37:25] knows exactly what was happening to job
[1:37:27] at all
[1:37:28] times he sees you in your despair he
[1:37:31] sees you in your darkest moments he sees
[1:37:34] you when you're questioning God he sees
[1:37:38] you and he's not condemning you he's
[1:37:40] he's I I just picture God and he's just
[1:37:43] saying let just let me love you just

[1:37:49] heavy and I will give you rest
[1:37:55] amen well I sure appreciate you tonight
[1:37:58] we
[1:38:05] had you know I think the other thing
[1:38:08] that was burning in my heart just about
[1:38:10] just about the deceiving the deception
[1:38:12] and things is is you know Jesus told the
[1:38:15] woman at the well she was wonder where
[1:38:17] do we where do we we worship some say
[1:38:19] this mountain some say over here some
[1:38:21] say over there and Jesus said woman the
[1:38:22] time will come when the shall Worship in
[1:38:24] spirit and in truth praise the Lord and
[1:38:26] I think many times we can worship in
[1:38:28] spirit we've had the spirit we've
[1:38:30] experienced the spirit we have the truth
[1:38:33] we experience the truth but I think we
[1:38:36] need those two to come together and so I

[1:39:05] things and and really look at them and
[1:39:08] make sure that we're not being the ones

[1:39:37] poison that we could just we could pray
[1:39:40] for him that we could pray for our
[1:39:41] pastor we could because I've seen it
[1:39:44] where we can be ministering and and just
[1:39:48] feels like a like a struggle there's
