[9:32] care of us, Lord. We bring these prayer
[9:34] requests before you tonight, Lord. Um
[9:36] and those that raise their hands, Lord.
[9:38] There's those that's would be here
[9:39] tonight, Lord, but they're sick. they're
[9:41] not feeling well. I pray that you bless
[9:43] them, Lord. And may your healing hand go
[9:45] out and touch them, Lord. Those that's
[9:47] sick, Lord Jesus. Those that's facing
[9:49] something in their bodies, Father. May

[9:54] Jesus. Uh if there's any other pro
[9:57] financial troubles, spiritual troubles,
[9:59] deliverance, Lord, any kind of trouble,
[10:02] you you've got it all in control, Lord.
[10:04] Everything's in your hands. We place in
[10:06] your hands, Lord, and we begin to

[31:48] with a song and a smile. Fill my way
[31:53] every day
[31:55] with love.
[32:02] Hallelujah.
[32:03] [Music]
[32:06] Hallelujah.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a request.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:15] You know, we make that request from a
[32:17] heart of love and thanksgiving. Amen. To
[32:20] him. And Amen. And that's truly what's
[32:22] going to stand there on the other side
[32:24] is perfect love. Amen. And that's the
[32:27] the great achievement of the Holy
[32:29] Spirit, the love of God in our lives.
[32:33] Amen. And to think of it in its we're
[32:36] living in a time and an age where
[32:40] well people just can't put up with
[32:42] people.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; You you know how it is. You can't even
[32:47] you have to be careful when you pull up
[32:49] to a stoplight.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; You got to be careful even you look at
[32:53] someone. It's true.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; We're living in a time and an age.
[33:00] But it's not it's not the people.
[33:04] It's spirits.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; All of those spirits have been able been
[33:09] released, been able to come in. And if
[33:11] not for God's grace,
[33:13] &gt;&gt; if not for the grace of God,
[33:15] &gt;&gt; we would be caught
[33:18] &gt;&gt; in the same thing.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; But God in his rich in mercy
[33:25] &gt;&gt; has delivered us from this present
[33:27] darkness.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, thank God for his
[33:30] mercy.
[33:32] Amen. And not only to deliver us to live
[33:34] victorious here and now, but to know
[33:37] that we're being prepared.
[33:41] We're being molded and shaped.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; And when all that testing is over here
[33:46] in this earth, this life, we go, we
[33:50] leave the rapture. Amen. Or by the way
[33:54] of the grave, whatever.
[33:56] But I know one thing. We certainly have
[33:59] a promise. We have a body that is
[34:01] waiting reserved in the heavens. And
[34:04] when this place right here gets to that
[34:07] that molded place that matches
[34:12] that theophony which we've been
[34:14] connected to and is pulling on us, when
[34:18] all of that gets
[34:20] met just right,
[34:23] then the rapture goes.
[34:26] You know, God has never taken one flower
[34:30] too early.
[34:32] Sometimes in our way of thinking about
[34:35] things, sometimes we look at things and
[34:37] think this individual was only 50 or 20
[34:40] or 18 or 30. Yeah.
[34:44] Could have been a lot of life. But you
[34:46] know, God has never taken one flower too
[34:50] early. The prophet taught us that that
[34:53] until our purpose is served,
[34:56] &gt;&gt; we're to be here.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember my I remember my
[35:00] mama Browning when she she was over here
[35:04] in this one of the nursing homes there
[35:06] in North North Ridgeville. And
[35:09] when you found when others looked read
[35:12] her obituary and they read here she was
[35:15] for over 10 years in a nursing home and
[35:19] that's
[35:21] I guess that's kind of uncommon
[35:24] that someone would be in there that
[35:26] long. And you know, you look at the last
[35:30] few years of her life, she couldn't
[35:33] talk.
[35:35] She couldn't move herself.
[35:39] And you you could think, Lord, what's
[35:41] the purpose? But then when you hear
[35:45] the testimony of others that would come
[35:48] in that room, though she may not have
[35:49] been able to move these lips because of
[35:51] Parkinson's,
[35:54] but she knew how to talk to him.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; And the testimony was is there would be
[35:59] such a presence in that room
[36:03] &gt;&gt; when others would walk in.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we may not understand
[36:08] everything, but God knows.
[36:10] God has never made a mistake.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; And let me say this to you. He never
[36:17] made a mistake with calling you.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; He never made a mistake with touching
[36:21] your life.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; God don't make mistakes.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; God don't make coincidences. It's not
[36:28] happen stance. God is purposeful.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; In all that he does.
[36:34] And I believe if God could hear my
[36:37] mama's prayer where she could not even
[36:39] move that so riddled her body but God
[36:43] could hear the heart,
[36:45] &gt;&gt; how much more has God not heard your
[36:48] heart,
[36:49] &gt;&gt; my heart.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; You believe that tonight?
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Let's just go to him in prayer.
[36:56] Father,
[36:59] how we want to say thank you once again
[37:01] for your mercies, Lord.
[37:04] many things, Lord, that we
[37:08] we don't understand. But how wonderful
[37:11] it is, Lord, to be able to trust you.
[37:16] I would rather have that, Lord, to reach
[37:19] out and to trust you
[37:22] than to understand everything.
[37:26] Like the song says, we'll understand it
[37:28] better by and by.
[37:31] But to trust you, Lord, oh my, that's
[37:34] something that's deeper than what our
[37:36] intellect could go. That's more than
[37:38] what our knowledge or our comprehension.
[37:42] But oh God,
[37:44] how that Lord Jesus, you give us the
[37:46] grace that's needed. And really Lord,
[37:49] it's not our trust as far as something
[37:52] that we have some great quality, but
[37:56] Lord, it's what you have deposited
[37:59] in our lives
[38:01] by way of the Holy Ghost. And through
[38:04] that, Lord, of that divine love, it
[38:07] reaches back to you
[38:10] in trust.
[38:12] And we trust you, Lord.
[38:15] Now, Father, there's requests that have
[38:17] been offered up. There's needs that's
[38:20] here tonight.
[38:22] And I pray that, Lord, that if you see
[38:25] that there is something, Lord, beyond
[38:27] what I've looked at, listen to Lord, and
[38:31] read, then always, Lord, I'm yours. I
[38:35] just want to be a faithful servant,
[38:37] Lord. May you come by once again and
[38:41] minister to our needs.
[38:43] That's what we want to that's what we
[38:46] want, Lord, is you would speak to our
[38:48] needs.
[38:51] We just commit ourselves to you now,
[38:53] Lord. Ask that you would forgive us,
[38:55] Lord, of our sins and our shortcomings.
[38:58] And may your grace just continue to ride
[39:01] in upon us, Lord, wave after wave after
[39:04] wave. We pray in the name of Jesus
[39:07] Christ. Amen.
[39:11] Amen.
[39:14] Let's look here in the scripture this
[39:16] this evening. John 13.
[39:20] Amen. Thank you musicians and
[39:23] song leaders.
[39:32] Want to continue to keep different
[39:33] different ones in prayer. I know brother
[39:35] Roco was just being released yesterday
[39:37] and um he's just needs to get stronger
[39:41] in his body and you know how that
[39:43] sickness will take it out of you. Many
[39:45] of us have already been through that and
[39:48] I got a text from brother Danny Lewis
[39:50] here earlier this afternoon and he
[39:53] wasn't feeling well either. So let's
[39:54] just remember different ones in prayer.
[39:56] I I know you are but um let's just
[39:59] remember them in prayer. God will just
[40:00] give him strength.
[40:02] In John 13
[40:05] and verse 34,
[40:07] Jesus said, "A new commandment I give
[40:10] unto you, that ye love one another
[40:15] as I have loved you,
[40:20] that ye also love one another." Now
[40:23] notice, as I have loved you.
[40:28] Now remember when he talked with Peter,
[40:30] Peter Peter expressed that he loved him.
[40:33] But Peter could only express according
[40:37] to the love that he knew.
[40:40] It's only the only depth that he knew. I
[40:41] I feel thee. But here the Lord Jesus is
[40:45] writing of a new commandment now is to
[40:49] be restored. What they lost in Eden.
[40:52] Remember the prophet tells us they had a
[40:54] perfect understanding
[40:56] of the love of God.
[40:59] And so now this to be mentioned in this
[41:02] time, there's no doubt that the
[41:04] disciples and those as they were
[41:06] standing there hearing this, there's no
[41:08] doubt that they would have no idea of
[41:11] the meaning within this as far as to the
[41:15] degree that this would move and be made
[41:20] manifest through their life. Have no
[41:22] idea what it would take. But yet, as he
[41:27] spoke to them, that ye love one another
[41:30] as in the same degree as I have loved
[41:33] you, that ye also love one another. And
[41:37] by this shall all men know
[41:41] that ye are my disciples,
[41:44] if you have love one to another.
[41:50] Now, isn't it amazing? He never said
[41:51] that we'd be known by a doctrine.
[41:55] Even to be known by a picture
[41:58] &gt;&gt; but by this
[42:01] by this you'll be known as my disciples.
[42:05] This will be the distinguishing
[42:08] factor. Now we know many many people can
[42:11] attain to that element of love felio
[42:13] love within and it can be it can be very
[42:15] very wholesome. But in order for this of
[42:18] agape love, this has to be a divine
[42:22] sovereign work of the Holy Spirit
[42:25] himself making a deposit in our life.
[42:30] It can be no other way than God himself
[42:35] through you and I loving him and loving
[42:39] one another as he.
[42:43] I tell you, you talking about a
[42:44] supernatural work.
[42:46] Now granted friends, if God needed you
[42:48] or me to walk on the water, there was a
[42:50] need within that or how whatever the
[42:52] need is, then we want God to move
[42:55] according to that need. But one of the
[42:57] greatest achievements and what will come
[42:59] within the rapture, what will be taken
[43:02] is this perfecting of the love of God in
[43:05] the body of Jesus Christ. Amen. May God
[43:09] bless you and bless the reading of the
[43:11] word. As you're being seated, I'd like
[43:13] to continue to speak to you this this
[43:16] evening on
[43:18] pursuing
[43:20] the right thing.
[43:22] And
[43:24] when we look at this as we were kind of
[43:27] coming to a close last week, we see
[43:30] there's where there's a great difference
[43:32] between
[43:34] that of like and where love comes in.
[43:38] Because when Jesus would say to love one
[43:41] another to agopy them, it's not that we
[43:45] like maybe even someone's temperament or
[43:49] personality, but the love of God will
[43:52] look beyond that. But Jesus when he when
[43:56] giving this and these things being
[43:58] spoken to know that there would be
[44:00] differences that would remain about us
[44:03] in our personality and in our
[44:05] temperament and our makeup and all of
[44:07] the things of where we have come through
[44:10] in life. But yet the love of God would
[44:13] be able to look beyond that. So it never
[44:16] gave us any sort of a license to say
[44:19] well I will withdraw from this person
[44:23] because I don't like them per se as far
[44:26] as their personality, their temperament
[44:29] and we all are different. We have
[44:32] similarities yet we have differences.
[44:36] And if God wanted us all to be the same
[44:40] as far as our temperaments, our
[44:42] personalities, all of that, then God
[44:45] would have seen fit and would have
[44:48] changed that part about you and I. But
[44:52] God left that measure and that part
[44:54] within us, the temperament, the
[44:56] personality. And the prophet says the
[44:58] Holy Spirit comes and sets down right in
[45:01] the middle of your temperament, your
[45:04] personality. How the disciples were so
[45:07] different one from another. Brother
[45:10] Brham would take the message things that
[45:12] are to be and take about 15 minutes and
[45:15] deal with those differences of how that
[45:17] you could not judge Andrew by Peter or
[45:20] judge Peter by John. You you cannot. And
[45:23] this is why that we we don't judge or
[45:25] should not judge one another or judge
[45:29] ourselves by one another. Truly, we're
[45:31] fruit inspectors. But I want to just say
[45:34] this right now that some things that you
[45:36] might see or the lack of, it can change
[45:39] very quickly. Fruit itself can change
[45:42] very quickly. Fruit comes on and it goes
[45:44] through a whole process. So we always
[45:46] want to just commit everything into the
[45:49] hands of God. But I want to just say it
[45:51] like this that when we see it that the
[45:53] love of God with God's love there's no
[45:56] hatred. There's no detesting of that
[45:58] individual. You may not like their
[46:00] personality. They may like may may not
[46:03] like yours. But within it the love of
[46:05] God triumphs and is greater than those
[46:09] differences. And that's the power of the
[46:12] love of God in our lives. That's the
[46:13] motivating factor by which we strive for
[46:17] the unity of the spirit in the bond of
[46:19] peace. Did you ever catch how Paul would
[46:21] write that where he would say strive for
[46:24] unity. If unity was just something that
[46:26] was just a given if it was just
[46:28] something that you know well you don't
[46:29] have to work at it. Paul would have
[46:31] never wrote endeavor. He would have
[46:33] never wrote strive. he would have never
[46:35] wrote. In every one of Paul's epistles,
[46:39] you find the appeal for unity as well as
[46:43] God giving direction and instruction.
[46:45] You say, "Well, why would that be?"
[46:47] Because the Holy Spirit cannot work into
[46:51] the full capacity that he desires to
[46:54] work to fulfill his word if there's
[46:56] disunityity. So, the Holy Spirit works
[46:59] within his word. And and you know,
[47:00] sometimes Satan would like to take a
[47:02] hold of of of things within this measure
[47:05] and make it as though that it's somehow
[47:07] elementary, but yet you find the prophet
[47:09] dealing with this all the time. Even in
[47:12] the opening of the message of Christ,
[47:13] the mystery of God revealed where the
[47:16] prophet would liken that to be that
[47:18] seventh seal message. And he would take
[47:20] almost 45 to 50 minutes and deal with
[47:24] these aspects in the beginning of that
[47:27] message and talk about how Satan will
[47:29] try to get among you, try to bring
[47:31] bitterness in, try to cause you to think
[47:33] differently against a person. Just
[47:35] understand that these are ways that
[47:38] Satan works to try to hinder the
[47:41] outworking of the Holy Spirit in our
[47:44] life. It's just like this that if you
[47:46] know you can be going down a road, we
[47:48] were um on vacation and there was a um
[47:52] some time ago and you know we were we
[47:54] were caught out in the midst of a storm
[47:56] and man I mean it was a storm that was
[47:57] coming through. Actually there were
[47:58] different tornadoes that were hitting
[48:00] down around in here in June and other
[48:02] places like that and we were right out
[48:03] there in the midst of it having to drive
[48:05] around trees that were falling on the
[48:06] road and I mean things were actually
[48:08] falling as we were driving. Now what
[48:11] happened is is there actually became
[48:14] roads that was at moments earlier
[48:17] passable and they became impassable.
[48:21] Somebody had to come along the way and
[48:24] remove that tree. They never came back
[48:26] to that place and said, "Well, this
[48:28] isn't going to be a a road that we're
[48:30] going to use any longer." But
[48:32] temporarily, it had to be dealt with
[48:34] until th that which was causing it to be
[48:37] impassible could be removed. And that's
[48:40] the same way that God works in our life,
[48:42] bringing us to not only a place to where
[48:45] that always about cleaning things out of
[48:48] our life, but yet to keep us in a place
[48:51] that where the spirit of God might have
[48:54] the rightway and the liberty not only in
[48:57] our lives, but right here among us as a
[49:00] body of believers. There are needs that
[49:03] sometimes that you might look at a
[49:05] person or you might think, well, there
[49:06] couldn't be any real severe needs. But
[49:09] let me tell you, every time that we come
[49:11] together as a body of believers, there
[49:14] are needs that are among us. There are
[49:17] lives that need a real divine touch from
[49:20] God and need deliverance. There are
[49:22] spirits that need to be cast out and
[49:25] broken back. And there's hearts that
[49:27] need to be filled and lives that need
[49:29] ministered to. There's sick that's among
[49:31] us. So within everything, there's such a
[49:34] a vastness among us. And and I think
[49:37] that within everything we could say that
[49:39] Lord I do not want to be part in
[49:42] hindering that. But I want to be part
[49:45] that the Holy Spirit could pass through
[49:48] my life that there are needs among us
[49:51] where deliverances can come and whatever
[49:54] the need is God you're more than
[49:56] sufficient. Let me just be a faithful
[49:59] part within that.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] I think that's the greatest one of the
[50:03] things that we could ask because you
[50:05] know agape love when we think of this
[50:08] you know when God agapeed the world
[50:12] there in John 3 he did not like the
[50:14] world he did not like what he was seeing
[50:17] or or the behaviors or of these things
[50:20] listen when God got a hold of our life
[50:22] if God would have got a hold of our life
[50:26] based on the things that we were doing
[50:29] the way way we were going about things,
[50:31] even how we thought about things. If God
[50:34] would have based it on that, he would
[50:37] have never touched our lives. But that's
[50:40] where agape love is so much different
[50:43] from felio love because felio love is in
[50:47] in its best yet it is still conditional.
[50:51] When the right conditions are met, then
[50:53] it can be expressed. But this is why
[50:56] that there has to come a a deeper
[51:00] reality in our lives of the love of God
[51:04] or that it goes beyond file. It's
[51:07] something that will work in our lives to
[51:10] move us and motivate us to strive then
[51:13] for unity because I if we agape then we
[51:16] will allow the correct brotherly
[51:19] kindness the correct expression and even
[51:22] of those who maybe aren't according to
[51:24] our taste or our like but where we're a
[51:27] body and love in our hearts is not a
[51:29] conditional things. Now, I say that very
[51:32] intentionally because if God wanted
[51:34] everybody in this church
[51:37] to be just exactly alike, he would have
[51:40] done that.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; True.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; That's why I told one individual some
[51:44] years back when, oh, they were looking
[51:46] for, you know, a church and they were
[51:48] talking about things. I said, just just
[51:50] let let me mention this to you. They
[51:53] weren't coming here. I said, just let me
[51:55] mention this to you as a fellow brother
[51:57] and as a pastor. Do not take a clipboard
[52:01] and go from church to church to church.
[52:05] I said, "This is what this is what you
[52:07] do." I said, "Do you believe that you
[52:09] have the Holy Spirit?" "Yes, I do." I
[52:11] said, "Then he's a guide." The Bible
[52:13] said that the spirit of truth will lead
[52:15] and guide you into all truth. So, it's
[52:18] not about a clipboard whether everything
[52:20] is lining up and administration is this
[52:23] and they do it like this and have this
[52:24] kind of a meeting and do this. Don't
[52:26] don't do that because you're going to
[52:28] find things that'll never alltogether
[52:29] match up. But if you will entrust your
[52:32] life to the guide, then God will guide
[52:35] you where you need to be. And it might
[52:37] not be really according to your
[52:39] choosing. But remember the prophet said
[52:42] when we have been redeemed, we no longer
[52:45] want our own choice.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; We want his choice because he has been
[52:49] our choice. Is that right? So you begin
[52:52] to see how that God would work in such a
[52:55] measure within that that because it does
[52:57] not allow us then to pull ourselves off
[53:00] into an island. Now notice first John
[53:03] chapter 3. John would write so much
[53:06] concerning this. He said we know that we
[53:08] have passed from death unto life. So
[53:10] this would be a litmus test because we
[53:13] love the brethren. He that loveth not
[53:17] his brother abideth in death.
[53:21] Now, loveth not would mean to detest or
[53:24] despise. Oh, I can't stand that brother.
[53:28] There's something wrong there.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong. You may not
[53:33] like per se as far as maybe the aurora
[53:36] or the personality. And don't try to
[53:38] refine that as just being well, they've
[53:40] got the Holy Ghost or they don't got the
[53:42] Holy Ghost. The prophet never did that
[53:45] when he talked about atmosphere because
[53:48] we're all made up differently. Now, I'm
[53:50] not making excuses, friends. I'm just
[53:53] trying to tell you that one thing for
[53:54] sure that within it is that there are
[53:57] differences that are there that's among
[54:00] us. But it no matter the differences, as
[54:04] it says in the word, whosoever hateth
[54:06] his brother is a murderer. And you know
[54:09] that no murderer hath eternal life
[54:13] abiding in him.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Now remember, brother Bam says there's
[54:17] many more ways that you can murder a
[54:20] person than just killing them.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; He said you can take something greater
[54:24] than a knife and that is you can destroy
[54:27] their character to somebody else.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's murdering. What
[54:32] what what would that be? That is trying
[54:34] to tear someone down. But yet listen, if
[54:37] they are one that Christ died for. Well,
[54:40] brother Samuel, we don't know that. All
[54:41] right, hold on. Right here, even in this
[54:44] body, we have lives and hearts that have
[54:47] come into the body of Jesus Christ. They
[54:50] have been baptized into the spirit of
[54:53] God. And then there might there are
[54:55] others that would be around that are in
[54:57] process and in journey. and God dealing
[55:01] with their life to bring them into the
[55:04] body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of
[55:06] the Holy Ghost. Because just to come to
[55:08] church, just to be affiliated around the
[55:11] message is not to be a part of the body
[55:15] of Christ. The body of Christ, we are
[55:18] baptized into that, not by water
[55:20] baptism, but baptized into that by one
[55:23] spirit. That's the Holy Spirit coming
[55:26] into our lives. And yet God would allow
[55:28] all of this to be all around us. Not
[55:31] only differences, but God will have
[55:33] lives in journey. And there can be lives
[55:36] that will never come to the knowledge of
[55:38] the truth. And God will allow all of
[55:40] that to linger for what for for what
[55:43] purpose? To test and display the divine
[55:47] perfect love of God through our lives.
[55:52] It's not up, you know, this is why I
[55:53] love it's not up to me to make the call
[55:56] on anybody.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to Why that that's beyond
[56:00] my pay grade. God did not ask me to do
[56:03] that. But God said only preach the word
[56:05] and the word will produce the right
[56:08] effect and it will bring forth. It has
[56:11] transforming power within it. Listen,
[56:13] there can be conditions you're looking
[56:15] at right now and situations. Just give
[56:18] God time to work. Don't put God on a
[56:22] time frame. Don't try to put God in a
[56:24] box. Let God work. And I'm telling you,
[56:27] even among lives that are coming in, let
[56:30] God work on their lives.
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:35] &gt;&gt; The love of God cannot fail.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[56:41] &gt;&gt; So no matter within this, no murderer
[56:44] hath eternal life abiding in him. Hereby
[56:48] perceive we the love of God, because he
[56:52] laid down his life for us, and we ought
[56:55] to lay down our lives for the brethren.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; What an age that we're called to. This
[57:02] is an age that's all about me.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; If it fits me, if it works okay with me,
[57:10] if it's convenient for me, it's all
[57:13] about me. This is an age of self. And
[57:16] yet this would be the age that God would
[57:20] set forth that in this age a people
[57:23] would actually come into that place that
[57:26] what they had in that alpha age where
[57:29] they actually came to a place of being
[57:32] capped off with divine love.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; That the spirit of God would be able to
[57:38] so draw a people up into himself in all
[57:44] things. and God. Now, think about it.
[57:47] Listen, friends, let's be honest. If
[57:48] it's you or me, though, there's some
[57:50] projects at home that I've got in. I
[57:52] wish I had never got in. I thought I got
[57:54] in over my head. I thought, Lord have
[57:56] mercy. What have I got into? You know
[57:59] how it is? You start talking to
[58:00] yourself. What are you doing? How did
[58:03] you Why did you even start this? But you
[58:05] know what? God knows in the midst of
[58:08] this hour, where would light shine the
[58:11] brightest? When it is the darkest, it
[58:14] shines in the midst of this age and this
[58:17] hour where there's a group of people
[58:20] that will come to that place of maturity
[58:23] where the very capstone of God's grace
[58:26] setting down on their lives and taking
[58:28] us home in rapturing grace and it will
[58:31] be the achievement of divine love.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; He laid down his life for us.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was him
[58:41] &gt;&gt; laying it down for us. Notice, but
[58:44] whosoever hath this world's good and
[58:46] seeth his brother have need and shutth
[58:48] up his bows of compassion from him, how
[58:50] dwelleth the love of God in him.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, this brother,
[58:57] I really like this one. I I'll help this
[59:00] one out.
[59:03] But what about the brother that you
[59:06] maybe don't?
[59:10] It's kind of like sandpaper.
[59:13] See, if we're not careful, we want to
[59:15] make that sandpaper and all of a sudden
[59:18] trying to determine who has the Holy
[59:20] Ghost and who doesn't.
[59:23] You have differences in your life. And
[59:27] the Holy Spirit will give you overcoming
[59:31] grace in your own life. Not take away
[59:35] your roughness, but he will sweeten your
[59:38] roughness in order to prove to you and
[59:42] through your life that there is
[59:44] something and one inside of you that is
[59:47] greater than was ever there before. And
[59:50] that is the divine love of God.
[59:54] What drove God to become down and become
[59:57] one of us? Love.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; The love of God that he was willing to
[1:00:02] lay aside his splendor, willing to be
[1:00:05] humiliated. Look, the body that he took
[1:00:07] on was a body of humiliation.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; He did not do that for himself. He did
[1:00:12] not do that to become a display down
[1:00:15] here. He was tempted in all of that to
[1:00:18] display his glory, display his power.
[1:00:21] But he came down in that body of
[1:00:23] humiliation in order to redeem you and
[1:00:26] I.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; You know, there's things he went through
[1:00:30] he didn't even have to,
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; but he did.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; He did. And he did it willingly that he
[1:00:36] might understand you and I.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; He was willing to lay aside his
[1:00:42] splender. I want you to think about it.
[1:00:44] If he had not been willing, the Bible
[1:00:47] tells us in Colossians, we were enemies
[1:00:50] in our mind, in our soul, our nature,
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; and by wicked works. But he was willing
[1:00:57] to lay aside.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; In order for what purpose? To redeem,
[1:01:03] not restore back that fallen nature, but
[1:01:07] to redeem what was beneath the darkness
[1:01:10] in our life. That's what he came for. He
[1:01:14] came to redeem his sons and daughters.
[1:01:18] And it would require him to lay aside
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; his splendor.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; What did that
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; love?
[1:01:28] Divine love. What will what? What is it
[1:01:31] that will cause us
[1:01:33] to be able to lay down our lives for one
[1:01:35] another? our thoughts, our feelings,
[1:01:39] our opinions. To be able to get rid of
[1:01:42] feelings, let me just say this to you.
[1:01:44] You are constantly going to have
[1:01:46] feelings, and you're going to have to
[1:01:48] constantly get rid of them.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; So, don't ever think that, oh, I'm going
[1:01:53] to come to this great apex of a
[1:01:55] maturity. I'll never have a wrongful
[1:01:58] thought. I'll never have a wrongful
[1:02:00] feeling. No, you're missing the point
[1:02:02] about adoption. Adoption is where you
[1:02:05] are no longer allowing this to rule you,
[1:02:08] but now where you on the inside are
[1:02:11] ruling that outer man and bringing it
[1:02:14] into subjection by the word and
[1:02:17] overriding your feelings. Oh my, you
[1:02:20] might have to pray for a period of time.
[1:02:22] The prophet said, "If you don't feel
[1:02:24] right towards that brother, go pray
[1:02:27] until you do feel right. Then go talk to
[1:02:30] them." Oh, hallelujah. I'm grateful
[1:02:33] those places were put in there because
[1:02:35] you know why this message even what I'm
[1:02:38] preaching tonight. It's not about
[1:02:40] political correctness. It's not to just
[1:02:42] get us all to say, "Amen. That's exactly
[1:02:45] right. That's what I'm doing." But it
[1:02:47] the word hits our lives in such a way
[1:02:50] that you don't need me measuring up your
[1:02:52] life. But it's the word as it's being
[1:02:54] preached. There is an examination that's
[1:02:57] going on within our lives that we can
[1:02:59] say, "Oh, God, help me, Lord God, in
[1:03:02] your mercy." But you see what it is?
[1:03:04] You're living in a time and there's
[1:03:06] seasons and there's things that's taking
[1:03:08] place that God is wanting to take you
[1:03:10] deeper and actually take you higher.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Let us not love in word,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; neither in tongue,
[1:03:21] but in deed and in truth.
[1:03:25] You know, people will never know what's
[1:03:27] in your heart
[1:03:29] unless you express it.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, I really love you in my
[1:03:34] heart. Then we express it.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; See, God God didn't leave you and I to
[1:03:38] guess like I I wonder if he loves me.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; He expressed that to you and I. He laid
[1:03:45] down his life for you and I and then he
[1:03:47] sent back the Holy Ghost to deal with
[1:03:48] our life. There is no question. I mean,
[1:03:51] think how God has worked with our lives
[1:03:54] over and over and still is.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Think about how long-suffering that he
[1:04:00] is. Think about how he's worked with our
[1:04:02] life. Think about things that right now
[1:04:04] that you've been praying about. You've
[1:04:06] come to an awareness in your life and
[1:04:08] said, "God, help me, Lord. I need your
[1:04:10] grace. I'm seeing that in my life."
[1:04:11] Maybe it's a complex. Maybe it's
[1:04:13] something. Oh, Lord. God, I I just Lord
[1:04:15] Jesus, help me, Lord, give me grace. You
[1:04:17] know, that thing could have laid there
[1:04:19] for years and all of a sudden the Holy
[1:04:21] Spirit has brought you to such a place
[1:04:23] of an awareness in your life of what is
[1:04:26] in your life. But you know what? That's
[1:04:28] the love of God to look beyond that.
[1:04:32] Look over that and still deal with your
[1:04:34] life and bring you to the place even
[1:04:36] that you are tonight.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about it. If it was
[1:04:39] conditional, there's not one of us here
[1:04:41] today, I don't care how good of a day
[1:04:43] you've had, there's not one of us that
[1:04:45] deserve his presence.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Not one of us.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Not one of us. How many times we've been
[1:04:52] in prayer or maybe you're going down the
[1:04:54] road or something and his presence will
[1:04:56] come down. We don't deserve that,
[1:04:57] friends. It's not what we deserve. God
[1:05:00] shows us it's not about our conditions.
[1:05:03] He doesn't love us based on conditional
[1:05:05] love.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; It's unconditional. Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Now notice the same thing that he would
[1:05:10] ask of us. Well, I want you to think of
[1:05:12] this in 1 Thessalonians 4:9 and 10. As
[1:05:16] touching brotherly love, this is the
[1:05:18] first epistle. As touching brotherly
[1:05:20] love, you need not that I write unto
[1:05:23] you. For ye are yourselves are taught of
[1:05:28] God to love one another
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; even in what we just expressed and how
[1:05:34] that God became one of us. But not only
[1:05:36] in then how that he became one of us but
[1:05:39] how that individually in your life how
[1:05:42] he deals with you. How he deals with
[1:05:44] you. You are being taught the love of
[1:05:47] God
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; where you just sometimes can back your
[1:05:49] head think Lord God Lord Jesus how could
[1:05:52] you desire to have fellowship with me
[1:05:54] Lord
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; how could you Lord but God in his mercy
[1:05:58] he's teaching you how to love one
[1:06:01] another based on how he expresses his
[1:06:04] love towards you
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; are being taught of God you're not being
[1:06:08] taught secondhanded but you are
[1:06:10] absolutely through the experiences in
[1:06:13] your life being taught of God on how to
[1:06:18] love one another.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but Lord,
[1:06:23] that's my prayer. I want to be taught.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Most importantly, I want to be
[1:06:28] teachable, Lord.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be closed off. I want to
[1:06:31] be teachable, Lord. Cuz sometimes you
[1:06:33] come in, listen, friends, let's just be
[1:06:34] honest. Sometimes you come into
[1:06:36] situations and we all have been there
[1:06:38] and we will be there, but you have to
[1:06:40] approach things and say, "Lord, give me
[1:06:43] the wisdom on how to approach this.
[1:06:45] Lord, how do I go about this, Lord? How
[1:06:47] do I I want your love to be set forth
[1:06:50] and to guide my life completely. Lord, I
[1:06:54] need your wisdom." You know where all
[1:06:56] that's coming from? It's desiring God
[1:06:58] not only to teach us, but it's also a
[1:07:01] part in our life that is absolutely
[1:07:04] humbling ourselves and submitting to the
[1:07:08] love of God
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; that he might work his way through our
[1:07:12] lives.
[1:07:15] Oh, I know. I know
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; we don't like uncomfortableness.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; I don't like uncomfortableness. Do you?
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; I don't like that. But you know, God
[1:07:26] allows that to be because there cannot
[1:07:28] be a pearl produced
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; without there being a grain of sand to
[1:07:32] irritate.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; And when the grain of sand gets in there
[1:07:35] to irritate, what happens? What happens
[1:07:37] to that grain of sand? It gets covered
[1:07:40] over with all of that excretion from
[1:07:43] that inside of that oyster there, that
[1:07:45] clam. It becomes all covered over. And
[1:07:47] then people pay countless prices. They
[1:07:52] will auction them off for sometimes in
[1:07:55] the astronomical amounts of money and
[1:07:58] for what? Things that were put together
[1:08:02] as a string of irritations.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; That have become
[1:08:08] a symbol of beauty.
[1:08:12] See, that's what the love of God in our
[1:08:14] life, working out in our life, is
[1:08:16] actually able to take the things that
[1:08:19] are irritating. And it's not covering
[1:08:21] over someone, but it's actually God so
[1:08:24] covering over in our own will, in our
[1:08:28] life to wear it will reflect him in
[1:08:32] character that's priceless.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And indeed, watch this. And indeed ye do
[1:08:41] it toward all the brethren which are in
[1:08:45] all Macedonia. But we beseech you,
[1:08:48] brethren, that ye increase more and
[1:08:51] more. So we can increase. This is just
[1:08:55] one of many places in the scripture
[1:08:56] where Paul would admonish them. And how
[1:08:59] that we can absolutely increase in the
[1:09:03] love of God to where that it's actually
[1:09:05] less of us and more of God. But notice
[1:09:08] toward all the brethren. I find that to
[1:09:11] be very peculiar. What a commendation
[1:09:14] that it would write that it wouldn't
[1:09:15] just be something that you are
[1:09:17] displaying love but toward all the
[1:09:20] brethren. Remember the prophet tells us
[1:09:22] in that day on Calvary right before he
[1:09:25] preaches the kinsman redeemer. Oh
[1:09:28] brother Brandham I can live for that man
[1:09:30] right there. He's a good man. Brother
[1:09:33] Bram says, "But can you live for that
[1:09:37] man that hates you?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Can you live for that man who would kill
[1:09:41] you if he had the opportunity?" He said,
[1:09:44] "That's how you're able to test eternal
[1:09:48] life."
[1:09:49] Think about that. See, if in our minds
[1:09:53] it's things that, listen, friends, we
[1:09:54] battle within our humanity sometimes,
[1:09:57] maybe some more than others with
[1:09:59] temperament and how we're made up. And
[1:10:00] every one of us have different battles.
[1:10:02] But there can be lines that you can
[1:10:04] draw. Oh, they may not be drawn out here
[1:10:06] on the floor, but it can be lines that
[1:10:08] are drawn that we're not going to cross
[1:10:10] this line or cross that line. But in
[1:10:12] reality, where does that spring from? It
[1:10:15] is not God that would actually lead us
[1:10:18] to draw lines and to bring separation.
[1:10:22] Well, brother Samuel, this brother's
[1:10:24] wrong or this sister's wrong. Well,
[1:10:25] you're not going to help him by drawing
[1:10:28] a line.
[1:10:30] They don't need to be pushed down any
[1:10:32] further. They need help up.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; They need help up. Now notice, watch how
[1:10:39] this is word here in Ephesians 5 and
[1:10:42] verse one. Be ye therefore followers of
[1:10:45] God as dear children. and walk in love
[1:10:50] as Christ also hath loved us and hath
[1:10:53] given himself for an offering and a
[1:10:56] sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
[1:11:00] savor. So this is the key. Walk in love.
[1:11:04] Once again, if this was something that
[1:11:06] like the song we we sang here, fill my
[1:11:09] day every day with love.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; How many know there's distractions
[1:11:14] throughout the day?
[1:11:16] your greatest plans that you can have in
[1:11:17] the morning. I'm going to do this and do
[1:11:19] that and do this. And how many times
[1:11:21] have you had things come in your mind
[1:11:22] that's hijacked your thoughts and all of
[1:11:24] a sudden you think, I'm going to take
[1:11:25] care of this and before you know it,
[1:11:28] what you were going to take care of very
[1:11:29] quickly has taken up time.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's flustered,
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; It's it's just ate things up. Why?
[1:11:36] That's a tactic of the enemy because
[1:11:39] Satan knows our strength. You might say,
[1:11:41] "What does that mean?" just that little
[1:11:43] bit of reading or taking that little bit
[1:11:45] of time to pray. I tell you what it
[1:11:47] means. It means that you're putting God
[1:11:49] before you always. Lord, I don't even
[1:11:52] want to face the problems of the day. I
[1:11:54] don't even want to face even the things
[1:11:56] that I think aren't problems. I don't
[1:11:58] want to face the day without you. It
[1:12:01] doesn't got to be something that's a
[1:12:02] great big long prayer. But it's just to
[1:12:04] put him before you when you're getting
[1:12:07] ready to go on your job, when you're
[1:12:08] getting ready to go in the shift, when
[1:12:10] you're on your way to work. Lord, go in
[1:12:12] before me today, Lord. Watch over me.
[1:12:14] May your presence, Lord, just accompany
[1:12:16] me, Lord. No matter where it's going
[1:12:18] around, Lord, speak to my heart today,
[1:12:20] Lord God. Let my life, Lord, be a
[1:12:22] channel where the spirit of God can flow
[1:12:25] through my life. Speak to me, Lord.
[1:12:27] Reveal your word to me, Lord. Things
[1:12:29] that I've been hearing your prophet say,
[1:12:31] what I've been reading in the message
[1:12:33] and under the services, Lord, speak to
[1:12:35] my heart today, Lord God.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Walk in love,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:42] Hallelujah.
[1:12:44] Oh my. I know we could say more within
[1:12:47] that, but to walk as an offering and a
[1:12:50] sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
[1:12:54] savor. Notice in Galatians 5 verse 13.
[1:13:00] For brethren, you have been called unto
[1:13:02] liberty. only use not liberty for an
[1:13:05] occasion to the flesh, but by love serve
[1:13:09] one another.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Now, this word, this phrase is not
[1:13:13] talking about worthiness.
[1:13:18] This love is not based upon worthiness,
[1:13:22] but by love serve one another. For all
[1:13:26] the law is fulfilled in one word, even
[1:13:29] in this, thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; as thyself.
[1:13:35] Remember they asked, "Who's my
[1:13:36] neighbor?"
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; You remember that that that scribe? He
[1:13:40] was trying to slip out of that one.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; He got a little tight in that service.
[1:13:43] He Well, who is my neighbor? And Jesus
[1:13:46] brings it right down on how the
[1:13:48] everything, the law and the prophets,
[1:13:50] the commandments hang upon this.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. and who is my neighbor is one that
[1:13:57] I see is in need
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; now. It isn't altogether somebody laying
[1:14:03] beside the road like when Jesus speaks
[1:14:05] of the good Samaritan. They may not be
[1:14:07] laying down there where they have been
[1:14:09] beaten and they have been robbed
[1:14:11] physically, but Satan may have robbed
[1:14:14] them and may have told them all kinds of
[1:14:16] lies and and tried to build grudges and
[1:14:19] resentments and tell them nobody loves
[1:14:22] him and nobody cares for him. But that's
[1:14:24] your neighbor. When you see that one in
[1:14:26] need, that's why the prophet said there
[1:14:28] are many gifts
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; of healing.
[1:14:33] And he says there's many ways that God
[1:14:35] will heal.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; He said God can heal an old grudge
[1:14:41] through love
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; that's stretched out.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; He takes us through a whole litany of
[1:14:47] things that can actually work. Well,
[1:14:49] they don't deserve that. But you don't
[1:14:51] deserve his presence either. Many times
[1:14:54] you don't deserve him to come by your
[1:14:56] way and pick you up. Oh, I know. We may
[1:14:58] not be laying down on the ground, but
[1:15:00] sometimes we can be so oppressed within
[1:15:03] our mind, in our spirit, that we need
[1:15:07] help from God. And God comes by our way
[1:15:10] and he lifts us up, he'll drop a word.
[1:15:13] He'll have the ravens to drop just what
[1:15:16] we need. The angels of God. Do we
[1:15:18] deserve it? No.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; No. But God says, "You're my neighbor."
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As the prophet puts it like
[1:15:26] this, God says to you when we have come
[1:15:28] into that place with him, we're buddies.
[1:15:31] God sees my neighbor is down. My
[1:15:34] neighbor needs help. My neighbor needs
[1:15:36] encouragement.
[1:15:42] Who is my neighbor?
[1:15:44] Who do you see
[1:15:46] that's in need?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Who do you see that's in need? Well,
[1:15:52] brother Samuel, they haven't been to
[1:15:55] church in weeks.
[1:15:58] Maybe they haven't been. I've seen them
[1:16:00] sitting there. Really?
[1:16:03] Really? You see, if you see someone in
[1:16:06] need, that's your neighbor.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; That's your neighbor.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And God is may not be everybody else in
[1:16:14] the body that is maybe seeing it in that
[1:16:16] life, but God lets you see that. And how
[1:16:19] do you serve them? By love. It ain't
[1:16:22] that maybe you're going along, maybe
[1:16:23] there's something that they got going.
[1:16:25] It ain't about you got to compromise.
[1:16:27] That's not what we're talking about,
[1:16:28] friends. But we're talking about that
[1:16:30] prophet tells us over and over. He said,
[1:16:32] "Sometimes people just need a hand."
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; A hand and encouragement,
[1:16:41] love that'll break that. Oh, remember
[1:16:43] remember how the man he kept on walking
[1:16:45] into the house? His neighbor was his
[1:16:47] wife. She would give him what for? from
[1:16:51] coming in from them meetings. And here
[1:16:53] the prophet told him said, "You're going
[1:16:55] all wrong about it." Took in a box of
[1:16:57] chocolates. You've heard me recite this
[1:16:59] hundreds of times. But I want you to
[1:17:02] think of it ain't about how much that
[1:17:03] you and you and I can finish it. It just
[1:17:05] goes to show sometimes we can become so
[1:17:08] geared and that we're wanting to express
[1:17:11] the right thing. This has to be broken
[1:17:13] this way. This has to be broken this
[1:17:15] way. Let me just tell you friends, God
[1:17:17] has a way of totally blowing up our
[1:17:19] ideas. You know, the greatest thing
[1:17:21] that'll win people to the house of God,
[1:17:23] and the greatest thing that'll win them
[1:17:25] to listen to you is a display of divine
[1:17:28] love that you care about them.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you've got to take time
[1:17:35] and go out of your way.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Man, maybe I need you to stop right
[1:17:40] here.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; We're living in We're living, friends,
[1:17:45] in this moment where we can look and see
[1:17:47] and you got a choice. H too busy. Oh, I
[1:17:52] don't have time for that. I don't have
[1:17:54] time for this. But you see, watch the
[1:17:58] very next phrase. Some of you got your
[1:17:59] Bible open. You don't have to. But I I I
[1:18:01] just want you to watch. Look at the very
[1:18:03] next verse. Very next verse out of
[1:18:05] Galatians. But if ye bite and devour one
[1:18:09] another, that's the alternative.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; That's called cannibalism.
[1:18:15] If a house be divided against itself,
[1:18:18] how can it stand?
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord?
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; This I say then, walk in the spirit and
[1:18:34] ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:18:36] flesh.
[1:18:38] That's a key right there. Walk in the
[1:18:40] spirit.
[1:18:42] Well, brother Samuel, I've been born in
[1:18:44] the spirit, then walk in it. And walk in
[1:18:46] it is a decision and a choice daily
[1:18:51] to live under the influence of the Holy
[1:18:55] Spirit.
[1:18:57] Didn't say that the lust and desires
[1:18:58] would not come,
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; but when we're under that influence,
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; that white dog will always prevail.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:19:09] So this is where when we see that the
[1:19:11] whole Christian move and brother Bra
[1:19:14] asks asked the question. He says, "Oh,
[1:19:15] how many would like to see a real Bible
[1:19:17] church? A real Bible church where all
[1:19:19] the spiritual gifts were set in order.
[1:19:21] Everything making it manifest just
[1:19:23] exactly the way he said it should be."
[1:19:25] Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful? Now,
[1:19:27] we're going to have to sacrifice not
[1:19:29] money. You're going to have to sacrifice
[1:19:31] what?
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Some of your own ideas. You're going to
[1:19:35] have to sacrifice some time in prayer.
[1:19:37] You're going to have to sacrifice maybe
[1:19:39] a stubborn will to break down in
[1:19:41] humility. The whole Christian move is
[1:19:45] sacrificial.
[1:19:48] You're sitting here tonight. You made a
[1:19:49] sacrifice to be here tonight. I I want
[1:19:51] to also tell you I appreciate that from
[1:19:52] the bottom of my heart. I want to say
[1:19:54] God bless you on behalf of our Lord
[1:19:56] Jesus. I want to say God bless you cuz
[1:19:58] you made a sacrifice to be here. You
[1:20:00] might say, "Brother Sammy, I'm retired.
[1:20:02] I didn't come from work." But you had to
[1:20:03] fight through every demon. You had to
[1:20:05] fight through all kinds of mind battles
[1:20:07] and everything else that wanted to come
[1:20:09] your way. Things where the Satan wanted
[1:20:11] to beset you. But you made a choice and
[1:20:14] there was an overcoming in your life. So
[1:20:17] do not allow the enemy to minimize that.
[1:20:20] I say God bless you.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; The whole Christian move, every bit of
[1:20:25] it is sacrificial.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of this. The prophet
[1:20:31] tells us like this. He said, "As long as
[1:20:33] Satan can keep you firing at one
[1:20:35] another, he'll just sit back and say,
[1:20:37] "Brother, I don't even have to fight."
[1:20:40] But if we could just get together and
[1:20:42] look up to God as brethren and and step
[1:20:44] in arming and united, you don't have to
[1:20:46] change from one church to the other, you
[1:20:48] do what you do the way you want to. Them
[1:20:50] little differences you make is no
[1:20:52] difference anyhow. God give every one of
[1:20:54] you the Holy Ghost. God gives the Holy
[1:20:57] Ghost to who obeys him. So surely
[1:20:59] somebody has obeyed God. But the thing,
[1:21:02] as long as Satan can keep the little
[1:21:04] differences, that's what makes the
[1:21:07] church in such a commotion as it is
[1:21:10] today. Let's forget that thing and come
[1:21:14] together. Notice what he's saying. Let's
[1:21:16] forget
[1:21:18] that thing.
[1:21:22] Not pretend. Well, let's pretend it
[1:21:23] didn't happen. Let's forget it.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; How do we forget it?
[1:21:28] How do we actually forget it or put
[1:21:30] things in the past?
[1:21:34] Paul would would would would admonish us
[1:21:36] in Colossians. And there is a place,
[1:21:38] this is not, let me say this, every bit
[1:21:41] of this that that I'm reading from here
[1:21:42] tonight, it's not things that we're
[1:21:44] looking at and saying, well, it's just a
[1:21:46] switch within you. Well, I just forgot
[1:21:48] it. No, it sometimes it takes in our in
[1:21:52] our lives being honest. the Lord,
[1:21:55] there's some feelings it's not right.
[1:21:58] But as a son and daughter of God, you
[1:22:01] are taking it before the throne of God.
[1:22:04] You're not taking it on Instagram.
[1:22:06] You're not taking it on Facebook. You're
[1:22:08] not taking it to this breakfast or that
[1:22:10] one or this person's house. But as a son
[1:22:13] of God, don't allow the enemy to condemn
[1:22:16] you for the feelings that he's tried to
[1:22:18] stir up in you. But take it in his
[1:22:21] presence because in the presence of God,
[1:22:25] that's where your enemy can be dealt
[1:22:27] with.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be ashamed to bring
[1:22:30] him in there. Let me preach it now. You
[1:22:33] don't have to be, well, I had this
[1:22:35] feeling. You don't have to walk in there
[1:22:36] with shame. Let me tell you, Esther, the
[1:22:39] scepter is extended to you.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; It's recognizing I'm going to have
[1:22:45] disturbances in my flesh. I'm going to
[1:22:48] have feelings, but I'm going to go to
[1:22:49] him. I'm going to go to him. I'm going
[1:22:52] to go to him who gives me the strength.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Because where does the cleansing of the
[1:22:59] death come from? From the inside.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not going to re reside on the
[1:23:06] outside realms.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to God.
[1:23:12] all of our differences.
[1:23:17] You ever been around, y'all, I know I'm
[1:23:19] saying I'm talking plain here. You ever
[1:23:21] been around situations and things and
[1:23:23] you can maybe on the job, let's say on
[1:23:25] the job or family or whatever more and
[1:23:27] you come into things and you've got
[1:23:28] maybe that uncle that's sitting right
[1:23:29] there and that uncle is talking about
[1:23:31] this aunt over here and this and that
[1:23:33] and here that their back is to him and
[1:23:34] that aunt's coming this way and here you
[1:23:36] are sitting there with that plate of
[1:23:37] food and you're just looking up. You're
[1:23:38] just like, "Lord, what do I do right
[1:23:39] now? Do I go ahead and say something or
[1:23:41] what?
[1:23:43] Right? Cuz you know if that aunt walks
[1:23:45] up and then this is said, it's awkward,
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; right? And it really isn't that you
[1:23:51] wanted to hear that anyhow, right? You
[1:23:53] understand what I mean? But it becomes
[1:23:55] you're trying to change something. Then
[1:23:56] you got sometimes individuals that can
[1:23:58] come into a situation and all of a
[1:24:00] sudden and and listen, everybody is made
[1:24:02] up so differently. Sometimes you'll have
[1:24:04] individuals and they'll just want to
[1:24:05] drop something and it's of things that
[1:24:07] you think, wait a minute, there's
[1:24:09] already been resolved to this.
[1:24:12] But you you know what that is? Listen,
[1:24:15] don't demean the individual because that
[1:24:17] now becomes another way of being tested
[1:24:19] in divine love. Because all that is is
[1:24:22] the enemy want to try to stir up
[1:24:24] commotion,
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; one to try to make a scene, one to try
[1:24:29] to break things apart. I mean, you go
[1:24:31] into a restaurant, just imagine this.
[1:24:32] You go, "Oh my, I can't wait to get in
[1:24:34] this restaurant. Man, I'm my steak. I'm
[1:24:36] going to have that ribeye. It's going to
[1:24:37] be medium. Oh, it's going to be so
[1:24:39] tender. going to be hot pink center. How
[1:24:41] I'm going to have that baked potato all
[1:24:42] loaded up and probably making both your
[1:24:44] m your mouth water and mine is too. And
[1:24:46] you get in there and all of a sudden
[1:24:47] you're coming up to the door. You
[1:24:50] already can taste that steak
[1:24:53] and all of a sudden there is people
[1:24:56] running out of there and saying this is
[1:24:59] terrible. This has been the worst. This
[1:25:02] you're probably not going to feel like
[1:25:03] going in there.
[1:25:05] It's a commotion that's kind of worked
[1:25:08] for you to look over your wife and say,
[1:25:09] "What do you think?
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe Mexican tonight, huh?"
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; See, just commotion. And that's all the
[1:25:17] enemy wants to do is try to get
[1:25:19] commotion,
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; What's he doing that based on
[1:25:23] differences?
[1:25:24] Notice he said, "We're the other brother
[1:25:26] is just as much in Christ as we are.
[1:25:28] There's no big men, little men, no
[1:25:30] superiors. We're children. We're one in
[1:25:32] Christ. And our little differences don't
[1:25:34] make any difference. Whether Becky wants
[1:25:37] a blue dress, Sarah wants a red one.
[1:25:39] They're both getting dresses, so they
[1:25:42] mustn't argue about it. Right?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; You know what's amazing
[1:25:48] is that within these differences,
[1:25:52] the prophet tells us in God hiding in
[1:25:55] simplicity in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
[1:25:58] that when we stand there on the other
[1:26:00] side, soon as we've been changed and the
[1:26:03] rapture has come,
[1:26:05] all the differences
[1:26:07] will fade away. Right. Right.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; But God would allow the differences
[1:26:14] to remain
[1:26:16] while we're here in time because you
[1:26:21] know why? We're still here in these
[1:26:24] bodies.
[1:26:26] Differences
[1:26:28] that become so evident among us.
[1:26:30] Differences that you can look at and
[1:26:32] think, how in the world did God put a
[1:26:35] group of people like this together?
[1:26:38] And if you can be very honest, you can
[1:26:40] even look as husband and wife. And if
[1:26:43] you begin to realize where God brings
[1:26:45] you to into that place, you realize God
[1:26:48] knew just what he was doing when he put
[1:26:49] us together.
[1:26:51] God knew just what he was doing.
[1:26:55] It don't mean that we don't get on one
[1:26:56] another's nerves. It don't mean that
[1:26:58] there ain't differences.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; There is.
[1:27:02] Is that right? There is. Now let let me
[1:27:04] just let me just try to go here just a
[1:27:06] few more moments. In the book of
[1:27:08] Ephesians, Paul would write here about
[1:27:12] this this tabernacle, this dwelling
[1:27:14] place where he said, "For through him we
[1:27:16] have both accessed by one spirit unto
[1:27:18] the father. Therefore, you are no more
[1:27:20] strangers and foreigners, but fellow
[1:27:22] citizens with the saints and of the
[1:27:24] household of God, and are built upon the
[1:27:26] foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[1:27:28] Jesus Christ himself, being the chief
[1:27:31] cornerstone, in whom all the building
[1:27:33] fitly framed together, groweth unto an
[1:27:37] holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also
[1:27:39] are builded together for inhabitation
[1:27:44] through the spirit. So closely joined
[1:27:48] together. That's what fitly.
[1:27:51] Closely joined together.
[1:27:54] Builded together to take multiple parts
[1:28:00] and bring them together under one
[1:28:03] purpose and one plan in unity.
[1:28:08] Think of this.
[1:28:11] I want you to look at Solomon's temple
[1:28:12] here just for a moment.
[1:28:15] the stones where the prophet would, you
[1:28:17] know, brother Brandon would pick this up
[1:28:18] and speak on this many different times.
[1:28:21] But in first Kingsapter 6:7,
[1:28:24] notice what it says regarding this
[1:28:25] house, this temple. And this house when
[1:28:28] it was in building was built of stone,
[1:28:32] made ready before it was brought
[1:28:35] thither. So the stones were cut out in
[1:28:39] their own native lands.
[1:28:42] So when they got there, the scripture
[1:28:44] says, when they came, the stones were
[1:28:47] brought together. There was neither an
[1:28:49] hammer nor an axe nor a tool of iron
[1:28:52] heard in the house while it was in the
[1:28:54] building.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; So God didn't bring the stones together
[1:28:58] and all of a sudden saying, "I need to
[1:29:01] hack this off of you.
[1:29:04] We need to shape you a little different.
[1:29:06] Need to make you a little taller. We
[1:29:09] need to shape this. We need to do No.
[1:29:11] There was no sound of hammer, axe, any
[1:29:16] type of an iron tool. Now, in many ways,
[1:29:18] watch. Brother Brandon will type this in
[1:29:20] multiple ways. He'll type it in that of
[1:29:23] how that God would bring us together in
[1:29:26] that of a local body. And he'll also
[1:29:28] type it as the stones that are coming
[1:29:31] together at the time of the rapture that
[1:29:34] God will bring everything together in
[1:29:38] this great unity and harmony. And notice
[1:29:41] the bringing together in that unity and
[1:29:43] harmony comes by God revealing himself
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; right now. That's what's drawn us
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; together. That's what's drawn us out of
[1:29:54] this walk of life and this walk of life.
[1:29:56] You didn't know you were a stone that
[1:29:58] was a part of this building. You didn't
[1:30:00] know that. I didn't know that. But God
[1:30:02] in his mercy, he already knew that. And
[1:30:04] God sends a word and all of a sudden it
[1:30:07] begins to lay hold and breathe with a
[1:30:10] purpose and the will of God upon your
[1:30:12] life to begin to bring you into the
[1:30:14] place that God might place you
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; in his body.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Different. Oh my. There'll be a stone
[1:30:24] next to a stone and that stone would be
[1:30:26] ever so different. But notice the stones
[1:30:29] were cut according to the blueprint and
[1:30:32] they were placed in their proper
[1:30:34] position. The prophet says it like this.
[1:30:36] Many of the stones looked very odd. But
[1:30:38] there was a place in the temple for
[1:30:40] every odd
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; peculiar stone. God had a place for him.
[1:30:45] Our ministries which is a beautiful type
[1:30:47] or anotype shows that in our peculiarity
[1:30:51] our way of worship.
[1:30:54] So see, God's not interested in make
[1:30:56] everybody worship the same way.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; That's why that going from one church to
[1:31:04] another church, respect it.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Right? Just as much as when when people
[1:31:09] come here, respect it.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not and I don't I don't say this, we
[1:31:15] don't say this for any way, but we're
[1:31:16] not going to change just because, oh,
[1:31:19] somebody's coming,
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; And I don't say that without the love of
[1:31:22] God. I'm just trying to say that within
[1:31:24] it, it's always that respect and the
[1:31:27] peculiarity of the way of worship. What
[1:31:29] are you saying, brother Samuel? God has
[1:31:31] not chosen any ministry to be the pope
[1:31:35] of music in this hour.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; No, we already have an absolute God. I
[1:31:42] don't need a pastor. I don't need
[1:31:44] somebody to interpret that to me. God
[1:31:47] has already interpreted his word. Right.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; You think what a sorry thing it would be
[1:31:52] where you had to call me every time.
[1:31:54] Brother Samuel, do you think it's all
[1:31:55] right if I'd get this? Brother Samuel,
[1:31:58] you think it's all right if I do this?
[1:31:59] Brother Sammy, if you don't I'm not the
[1:32:01] Holy Ghost for you.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be the Holy Ghost for
[1:32:04] you.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? I've got confidence
[1:32:08] in a personal relationship with God. I
[1:32:12] believe there's things where as a
[1:32:13] pastor, God gives you a pastor that you
[1:32:15] can say, you can bring things and we can
[1:32:17] pray together and look for the counsel
[1:32:19] of God. Sure, God has that avenue, but I
[1:32:22] think you get what I mean is that we all
[1:32:24] have our peculiarities,
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; and our way of worship,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; There's some people that like practicing
[1:32:31] before they sing. Others don't.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Others don't. There's some that like,
[1:32:40] you know, certain things, like certain
[1:32:42] albums that are cut out of a studio.
[1:32:45] Others don't. Others like the impromptu
[1:32:48] of the live, the dynamics that come with
[1:32:50] that. It's preferences.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Then then again, of course, if we
[1:32:57] depends on if we want to spiritualize,
[1:32:59] that's a tendency we over we begin to
[1:33:02] spiritualize our preferences.
[1:33:08] In our peculiarity, our way of worship,
[1:33:11] when the temple, the real temple that we
[1:33:13] come to after a few minutes comes
[1:33:15] together, there'll be a place for every
[1:33:17] odd acting person.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; You ought to say, "Thank God I'm there."
[1:33:25] For every odd acting person. Odd to who?
[1:33:29] It ain't odd to you, but it might be odd
[1:33:32] to somebody else. But then once again,
[1:33:34] that's a test of the differences among
[1:33:38] us
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; because there's got to be something
[1:33:40] greater than likes,
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the love of God.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; And that which will actually move and
[1:33:49] unites us together, it will not be our
[1:33:51] likes. Oh, I know you might like this
[1:33:54] one and might like this one, but that's
[1:33:55] not what unites you. If that's what
[1:33:56] unites you, there's a big problem right
[1:33:58] there.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; There's a big problem right there. You
[1:34:01] see, it's okay to have the likes, but
[1:34:04] there's got to be something greater than
[1:34:06] just the likes. It's got to be the love
[1:34:08] of God. You cannot have out here, out
[1:34:10] here, outside of this this this this
[1:34:13] triple brick that we have right here.
[1:34:15] You do not just have bricks sitting on
[1:34:17] top of one another.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; They've got mortar between them.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And those that mortar between them is
[1:34:22] what holds them in place.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; What is it that holds you and I in
[1:34:28] position?
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; What is that? the love of God,
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let Let's stand. I'll finish
[1:34:36] this quote because I'm not going to keep
[1:34:37] going tonight.
[1:34:43] Some of you probably thinking, "God,
[1:34:45] thank you for your mercy."
[1:34:49] I don't know about you friends, but I
[1:34:50] enjoy this. Even Even if it's tearing me
[1:34:52] all to pieces, the Lord, I say, tearing
[1:34:54] me all to pieces.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; I want to be more like him. Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "We might look funny
[1:35:00] to somebody else, act a little funny,
[1:35:02] but remember, it's the place there for
[1:35:05] us." God is cutting out his church. And
[1:35:10] every little stone had its place fit
[1:35:12] exactly to it. Remember, it was cut away
[1:35:15] from the place it would be put together
[1:35:17] at. But when it come together, it didn't
[1:35:20] even need honing. It was already honed.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; God made it so it fit perfectly
[1:35:29] in its place.
[1:35:31] Ram says, "Oh, what a type we find of
[1:35:33] the spiritual. How every gift of God,
[1:35:36] every odd acting, every odd act of born
[1:35:40] again Christians in their peculiarity,
[1:35:43] yet it's got its place. It fits in the
[1:35:46] body. it goes to its right place. He
[1:35:50] said many of us would try to say now
[1:35:52] that's not of God. A good holy
[1:35:54] consecrated soldier of the cross and we
[1:35:57] say now we stood in church the other
[1:35:59] night and we heard such and such a thing
[1:36:01] that can't be of God.
[1:36:03] But if it's in line with the pattern, if
[1:36:07] it's in line with the scripture, it may
[1:36:10] be odd, but it's going to have its
[1:36:12] place. It'll fit right in. And it won't
[1:36:17] even need honing or polishing. It'll go
[1:36:19] to its place for the great architect
[1:36:21] Christ is preparing it now odd one to
[1:36:26] another.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; let's just stop right here for tonight.
[1:36:33] Differences.
[1:36:37] We're going to have them until we step
[1:36:39] from this side
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; to that side.
[1:36:45] Now we have an opportunity
[1:36:49] to be honest and come to places and say,
[1:36:52] "Lord,
[1:36:54] teach me how to deal
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; with differences.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Let the love of God because listen
[1:37:01] friends, let me just say this to you.
[1:37:03] Sometimes depending on even our
[1:37:06] upbringing as children,
[1:37:10] maybe coming through teenagehood and so
[1:37:12] forth, we weren't taught those things.
[1:37:17] But even if we were,
[1:37:21] we still need in this capacity
[1:37:24] the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Because you can take a person that
[1:37:28] could, man, they can get along with
[1:37:29] every Oh, I tell you, you couldn't rub
[1:37:31] them the wrong way. They get along with
[1:37:33] everybody, but that don't mean that they
[1:37:35] got the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells us in that statue of
[1:37:40] a perfect man, there's many people, he
[1:37:42] said, that have these virtues
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; within their natural self. They're not
[1:37:48] of they're not that that's godly, but
[1:37:50] they have that. You've met people that
[1:37:52] are as patient a patient can be.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; You think, you know what? I know why
[1:37:55] you're a kindergarten teacher. I know
[1:37:57] why you're a preschool teacher. Right?
[1:37:59] And then the same thing the way we look
[1:38:01] at patience there. You can look at
[1:38:02] others sixth grade, seventh grade. I
[1:38:04] know why you are. I know there's but
[1:38:08] it's it's patience but it's works in a
[1:38:10] different way.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; For what? According to the need that's
[1:38:14] at hand.
[1:38:16] But you see within these things how God
[1:38:18] would so work within our lives and us to
[1:38:22] come to that place to understand
[1:38:25] of differences.
[1:38:28] We have them, but one of these days
[1:38:30] they'll all fade away. But you know, I
[1:38:32] don't believe God wants us to stand here
[1:38:34] and say, "Oh, I'm longing for that day."
[1:38:38] When so and so is different,
[1:38:41] Lord. Even so, come Lord Jesus.
[1:38:48] Come, Lord Jesus. That's not even the
[1:38:50] right the right reason,
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; right? It's not even the right reason.
[1:38:55] Even when you're praying for the coming
[1:38:56] of the Lord. I I believe you should.
[1:38:58] Even on your job, we're people of his
[1:39:00] coming. You should expect him to come on
[1:39:03] your job and help you.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; We're people of the coming. You should
[1:39:07] expect him to come every day in your
[1:39:09] life. Lord, I need help. I need
[1:39:10] strength.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, in the meantime,
[1:39:15] God has allowed these differences. And
[1:39:17] if he wanted to strip all of them away,
[1:39:21] he would have done that.
[1:39:24] that God said, "I tell you what I'll do.
[1:39:26] I'll take this stone and this stone,
[1:39:29] this stone, and this stone." Lord have
[1:39:32] mercy. Lord, no.
[1:39:34] Not you're Lord. Surely you're not going
[1:39:37] to put these two side by side. I am.
[1:39:42] And you're going to put these stones
[1:39:44] above them. I am. And you're going to
[1:39:47] put these stones below them. I am.
[1:39:50] How is it going to work? Ah,
[1:39:54] because my love in them will serve as
[1:39:58] the mortar to overcome the differences.
[1:40:04] My love, my victory will shine through
[1:40:08] redeemed vessels that will actually come
[1:40:12] to a place in their life to be able to
[1:40:16] overlook differences
[1:40:19] by the love of God.
[1:40:23] I say, "Lord,
[1:40:25] help me, Lord.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Help me.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord." You know how it is in
[1:40:32] your family. Your children are all
[1:40:33] different. You might have two, four,
[1:40:35] five, three, our three boys, they're
[1:40:38] different. They got similarities, but
[1:40:39] they're different. They're different. I
[1:40:41] mean, in their personalities, the way
[1:40:42] things are, they're different.
[1:40:45] And they approach within that even
[1:40:47] certain things they like, certain things
[1:40:49] they don't like.
[1:40:50] You find that even in your home, but
[1:40:52] finding in the body. But I'm so glad
[1:40:55] that God made a way.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; That's something that's just not me
[1:41:00] having to put up with you and you put up
[1:41:02] with me. I'll tell you, I'm just going
[1:41:04] to put up with brother Samuel until the
[1:41:05] rapture. It ain't about putting up. That
[1:41:08] ain't what God that ain't the
[1:41:09] achievement.
[1:41:11] But it's where love itself
[1:41:14] can have victory and prove victory in
[1:41:17] our life beyond the differences.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? Isn't it powerful
[1:41:25] what the love of God look what it's done
[1:41:26] in your life?
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Look what it will continue to do.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Don't allow the differences to be your
[1:41:33] focus,
[1:41:36] but let the love of God be your focus.
[1:41:40] Even in your life, maybe you're standing
[1:41:41] here, sitting here, maybe streaming, and
[1:41:43] in your life you see differences.
[1:41:45] Brother Sam, I'm not I'm not there yet.
[1:41:47] Well, don't focus on the differences,
[1:41:49] but focus on the love of God that's
[1:41:52] calling to your heart
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; and saying, "My son, my daughter, come
[1:41:56] come into me fully." Don't focus on your
[1:42:00] differences, but focus on him who's able
[1:42:04] to make a real difference in your life.
[1:42:08] You love him.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together tonight.
[1:42:13] Father,
[1:42:16] Lord God,
[1:42:20] sometimes Lord, how things don't go,
[1:42:21] Lord, as we maybe have looked at or
[1:42:23] thought or where we're going to get to,
[1:42:25] but that that really, Lord, I've I've
[1:42:27] learned that really don't matter. What
[1:42:30] matters, Lord, is that you've been able
[1:42:32] to have your way and speak to our hearts
[1:42:36] according to the needs in our lives.
[1:42:39] Lord, there's not one of us that's
[1:42:41] gathered here tonight or that would be
[1:42:44] streaming this message.
[1:42:47] But Lord, what could say,
[1:42:50] "I want more." Lord,
[1:42:53] help me Lord to empty up.
[1:42:57] Help me Lord through that
[1:42:59] counsel that you've given knowing
[1:43:02] feelings and things will come but may we
[1:43:06] never never allow feelings
[1:43:09] to become
[1:43:11] a resident
[1:43:13] in our lives.
[1:43:15] But Lord God, may we Lord, I pray
[1:43:19] by the love of God,
[1:43:22] take every burden, take every care,
[1:43:25] take every feeling. It may not even be
[1:43:28] Lord God, a feeling that's between
[1:43:30] brothers and sisters here. It might be a
[1:43:33] feeling Lord of something in family,
[1:43:36] feeling Lord of on the job.
[1:43:40] But we want to have the right
[1:43:43] we want to have the right feeling Lord.
[1:43:48] So I pray that Lord as we come to you
[1:43:51] Lord once again here this evening
[1:43:55] and we see Lord in our lives it's
[1:43:57] continuously
[1:43:59] as the scripture admonished us walk
[1:44:02] in love.
[1:44:05] Let your life, let it be regulated
[1:44:09] by the love of God.
[1:44:12] Let it be the umpire, the rule, the
[1:44:16] absolute in your life.
[1:44:19] Oh God, help us,
[1:44:22] Lord. I want to say I don't believe that
[1:44:25] there's coming a bride. I believe she's
[1:44:27] on earth tonight.
[1:44:29] I believe we're a part of that, Lord.
[1:44:32] Not by our merits, no,
[1:44:35] but by the grace of God.
[1:44:38] Lord, like the scripture would say,
[1:44:41] "Behold, what manner of love is this
[1:44:44] that hath been bestowed upon us that we
[1:44:47] should be called the sons of God."
[1:44:52] Oh Lord,
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:44:55] help us, Lord. I pray.
[1:44:59] Lord, if there's one thing, Lord, when
[1:45:01] it all comes down, all said and done,
[1:45:06] we're not going to be taken out of here
[1:45:08] because of great miracles and things
[1:45:11] that's been done. Lord, how I thank you
[1:45:13] for every miracle. Thank you for every
[1:45:14] need. But Lord,
[1:45:17] the achievement in this hour
[1:45:20] is divine love.
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:23] And when your prophet when he was he
[1:45:26] come back from the other side, he had
[1:45:29] already been a changed man, he was
[1:45:31] already full of the Holy Ghost. But when
[1:45:34] he slipped back
[1:45:38] as he said, "Do I got to go back in that
[1:45:40] body that was laying on the bed?"
[1:45:45] And over and over he would say,
[1:45:49] "I cannot be the same William Brandham
[1:45:52] that I was before
[1:45:55] since I visited that place.
[1:45:58] It will take perfect love to get there."
[1:46:02] Never said it would take that it would
[1:46:04] have to be Lord God miracles and signs
[1:46:07] and wonders. All of those are needed as
[1:46:10] accompaniments along the way.
[1:46:13] But the separating,
[1:46:16] what will separate
[1:46:19] will be the love of God,
[1:46:22] the seal of the living God in the heart
[1:46:25] of the believer.
[1:46:28] Lord, I realize sometimes Lord, the
[1:46:30] enemy wants to make light
[1:46:34] to individuals. What are you doing? What
[1:46:38] part do you have? But Lord God,
[1:46:42] this is the hour
[1:46:44] that we're not to despise
[1:46:47] small things,
[1:46:49] but that part as a stone that you've
[1:46:52] called us to be. The prophet would re
[1:46:55] remind us, he said in that message,
[1:46:58] maybe it's a housewife, maybe it's at
[1:46:59] the grocery store, maybe it's at this
[1:47:02] place, it's at this and our families.
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:07] Lord God,
[1:47:10] help us. Lord,
[1:47:14] some Lord may never be used in certain
[1:47:17] capacities
[1:47:19] as others. That that doesn't matter. But
[1:47:23] what matters
[1:47:25] is the love of God from our heart.
[1:47:28] And Lord God, when they can, Lord Jesus,
[1:47:31] rest upon that to say, Lord, I know what
[1:47:34] you've done in my life. I know where you
[1:47:37] took me from, and I know how you cleaned
[1:47:40] me up, and you've filled my life, Lord.
[1:47:42] Taken the very desire of the world out.
[1:47:46] And only thing, Lord, in my heart's
[1:47:49] desire is I want to please you,
[1:47:52] Lord God.
[1:47:54] May they be ever so thankful for that
[1:47:56] work of grace because that's the
[1:47:58] greatest miracle that could ever be done
[1:48:02] and that the love of God would so
[1:48:05] triumph through their lives. Oh, Father,
[1:48:10] when they would go, Lord, to want to
[1:48:12] pull back maybe by human nature or
[1:48:15] things that they've been through and
[1:48:16] experiences in life, it would just be
[1:48:19] natural tendencies.
[1:48:22] But Lord God, as Paul said, the love of
[1:48:26] God constrainth us.
[1:48:29] There's another force on the inside.
[1:48:32] There's a strength, Lord, a hidden
[1:48:34] power, the love of God that moves within
[1:48:37] our heart, Lord God, that will not allow
[1:48:40] those feelings will allow not allow
[1:48:44] things
[1:48:46] to reside in that life.
[1:48:50] But Lord God to drive us to that place.
[1:48:53] Lead us to that place. Guide us to that
[1:48:55] place.
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:49:02] Help us Lord.
[1:49:06] I wonder Lord sometimes if we've not
[1:49:08] overlooked
[1:49:10] where this great adoption would bring us
[1:49:12] to.
[1:49:14] how the Lord Jesus would be pressed upon
[1:49:17] many times in the temple and he would
[1:49:19] slip right on by.
[1:49:23] Even when they were trying to get him to
[1:49:28] say something, they pulled beard out of
[1:49:30] his face, spit on him.
[1:49:33] But what was it? What caused
[1:49:37] that to be in that way that he would
[1:49:39] say, "Father, forgive them. They don't
[1:49:40] even know what they're doing.
[1:49:44] It was the love of God.
[1:49:48] I'm so glad.
[1:49:50] I'm so glad he was willing to drink his
[1:49:53] bitter cup. I'm so glad he was willing
[1:49:56] to look beyond the shame of the cross
[1:50:01] and see the joy that was set before him.
[1:50:05] to know what that victory on Calvary
[1:50:09] and raising on that Easter morning what
[1:50:11] it would do in my life
[1:50:16] and in the lives of others Lord.
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:20] Oh God,
[1:50:22] grant it. Lord,
[1:50:25] help us. Lord,
[1:50:27] help us, Father.
[1:50:31] Lord God, may the Holy Spirit
[1:50:34] just take this word, Lord, even as we
[1:50:36] would go from this place and from the
[1:50:38] presence of one another, Lord, just
[1:50:41] continue to move upon our lives.
[1:50:47] Press through us, Lord.
[1:50:50] move down, Lord, for each heart, each
[1:50:52] life. Lord, perhaps there's one or
[1:50:56] others here that would say or would
[1:50:58] stream,
[1:51:00] Lord, I want that love of God.
[1:51:03] I want that seal of the Holy Spirit in
[1:51:05] my life, I want that. I want that
[1:51:08] reality that will stand
[1:51:10] that where the desires of this world
[1:51:12] have faded and the only desire is I just
[1:51:15] want to please God.
[1:51:17] Lord Jesus granted, Lord, it doesn't
[1:51:20] take, Lord, a great effort from our
[1:51:22] lives. It takes us to believe you, Lord
[1:51:24] God, and to accept what you've done for
[1:51:28] us.
[1:51:29] You can meet them right there, Lord God,
[1:51:31] as they're streaming,
[1:51:33] Lord God. May be sickness in their body,
[1:51:36] circumstances, but you can meet them
[1:51:38] right there, the same as you can meet
[1:51:40] right here tonight, Lord. There's a
[1:51:41] need, and you're the God. You're Jehovah
[1:51:45] Gyra and you still meet the needs of
[1:51:48] your children. Grant it, Lord God.
[1:51:52] Grant it, Lord. I pray.
[1:51:55] May the love of God just sweep down,
[1:51:57] Lord. Drive back, Lord God. every spirit
[1:51:59] of darkness, Lord. Every spirit of
[1:52:02] doubt, Lord, every spirit of anxiety,
[1:52:05] Lord, every spirit of depression, Lord
[1:52:07] God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:52:11] Satan, you're defeated
[1:52:13] and you're a liar and you're nothing but
[1:52:16] a bluff. And in the name of Jesus
[1:52:19] Christ, we call your hand to it.
[1:52:24] The love of God
[1:52:27] is greater.
[1:52:29] Grant it Lord. Grant it Lord. I pray
[1:52:34] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:52:44] Glory be to God.

[2:01:13] God. Just such a when we see one
[2:01:15] missing, Lord, there's just something in

[2:01:21] Jesus. when we come to the appointed

[2:01:47] glue to us, Lord Jesus, and hold us

[2:01:51] might be, Lord Jesus. We just want to
[2:01:53] fit together, Lord, and and and be a
[2:01:56] help us all to to reflect you to one
[2:01:58] another, Lord Jesus. To reflect your
[2:02:01] light, one another. We love you, Lord.

[2:02:04] Lord. May you bless it. May it
[2:02:06] strengthen us, Lord Jesus, and uh be a
[2:02:09] light on our path. And when we deal with
[2:02:11] one another, Lord, whether we have
[2:02:12] differences or things, may this service
[2:02:14] come back to our memory, Lord Jesus, and
[2:02:17] and help us to just show the love of the
[2:02:19] Holy Ghost one to another. Watch over us
[2:02:21] until we should meet again. We love you
