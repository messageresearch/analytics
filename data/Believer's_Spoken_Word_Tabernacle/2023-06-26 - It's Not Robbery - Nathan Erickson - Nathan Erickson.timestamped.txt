[38:55] he thought it not robbery to be equal
[38:57] with God but he made himself of no
[38:59] reputation took upon him the form of a
[39:02] servant was made in the likeness of men
[39:04] and being found in fashion as a man now
[39:07] that fashion that's like the word form
[39:09] but it's a different it's a slightly
[39:11] different word that's the word schema
[39:13] schema which is be the figure or the
[39:15] shape amen so we have we have we have
[39:18] the word morphe and we have the word
[39:20] schema here in the Greek
[39:22] and so being in fashion of a man he
[39:24] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[39:26] death
[39:27] even the death of the Cross will read
[39:30] verse 9 as well therefore wherefore God
[39:32] also hath highly exalted him and given
[39:35] him a name as we're praising him this
[39:36] morning a name which is above every name
[39:38] so my title I want to take out of this
[39:41] scripture this text preached to you it's
[39:43] not robbery
[39:45] it's not robbery amen let's pray
[39:48] Heavenly Father
[39:49] Lord how we love you this morning Father
[39:51] we love your word

[40:10] God that was above us the Mighty God
[40:12] that was with us but now father the
[40:14] Mighty God is in your people we believe
[40:16] father and so Lord that's what we're
[40:18] trusting in today Lord we don't have any
[40:19] ability we have no thought of human
[40:21] ability in ourselves father we are
[40:22] helpless Lord but not hopeless father

[40:43] a little more of yourself to your people
[40:44] father may we feel a little more secure
[40:46] Lord in our position in you Lord at the
[40:49] end of it all we pray Lord we commit
[40:51] ourselves we commit this service to you
[40:53] Lord may you anoint speaker and hear
[40:55] alike I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen
[40:58] God bless you as you're seated this
[40:59] morning
[41:00] amen just to take a few moments on
[41:03] laying a foundation here brother Brandon
[41:05] preached the messages out of this
[41:07] scripture the Mighty God unveiled the
[41:09] unveiling of God talking about this this
[41:12] uh concept this truth of God and morphe
[41:17] God and morphe now we don't believe in
[41:19] many gods or three gods or two gods or
[41:22] or a multiplicity of God we believe in
[41:24] one God Amen for Lord thy God is one God
[41:28] he's one nature one force one person he
[41:32] he's One Life he's one amen but yet that
[41:35] one God will manifest himself in many
[41:38] different ways he has many different
[41:40] titles he has many different names he he
[41:43] wears many different masks and every
[41:45] time he changes his mask he's not
[41:46] changing who he is but he's changing his
[41:49] form he's he becomes God and morphe in a
[41:53] different mask God in morphe and Moses
[41:55] it was God in morphe in in in Elijah now
[41:59] God in Moses didn't look look like God
[42:01] and Elijah didn't do the same things as
[42:02] God Elijah but it was the same God is
[42:04] that right and so it's not a different
[42:06] person but it's God changing his mask
[42:09] that's what that word means and so so
[42:11] that that that morphe it's a very
[42:13] powerful word I don't think it's really
[42:15] captured in the English word a form
[42:17] being in the form of God it's it's uh it
[42:21] has a real powerful meaning to it this
[42:22] word morphe because we read the other
[42:24] word fashion that's that word schema
[42:26] that means the figure it means the shape
[42:29] it means when you look at it it looks in
[42:31] a certain form when you saw Jesus Christ
[42:33] when you looked at him what did he look
[42:35] like he was in the fashion of a man the
[42:37] schema of a man you saw Humanity you saw
[42:40] Frailty you saw weakness you saw
[42:42] Simplicity and humility but that doesn't
[42:45] that doesn't capture who Jesus was
[42:47] that's just what you saw that was just
[42:49] the figure that was just the shape but
[42:51] Jesus was God in amorphe and that morphe
[42:54] form is the embodiment of a spiritual
[42:58] Essence amen amen spiritual Essence when
[43:01] you when we look at Jesus Christ and we
[43:04] see him and we see the things that he
[43:06] did and hear the things that he said and
[43:07] look at his actions and look at his
[43:09] nature then what we're finding is that
[43:11] the spiritual essence of who God is was
[43:13] embodied in Jesus Christ and so he took
[43:16] the form of a man amen but in that form
[43:19] of a man it was more than a man it was
[43:20] God revealing himself through what we
[43:23] saw as a man is that right amen so God
[43:26] in morphe is very very powerful Concept
[43:28] in the Bible in John chapter 1 John
[43:31] begins to explain this concept he says
[43:33] look he said no man has seen the father
[43:35] at any time our God's a great mysterious
[43:38] and scrutable God he's above us he's
[43:40] Beyond us nobody there's no man that
[43:43] could wrap his mind around to understand
[43:44] who that God is but then John you hear
[43:47] the passion in his voice as I've
[43:48] preached many times when he says look
[43:50] but the word that was with God the word
[43:53] that was God Amen became flesh and our
[43:57] eyes looked at him we beheld him we
[43:59] could hear him we could touch him amen
[44:01] what a beautiful thing that's what God
[44:03] and Morphin is God and morphe is god
[44:06] making himself understandable a god you
[44:09] can't understand but he makes himself
[44:11] understood now now you can't demand that
[44:14] from him you can't you can't ex you
[44:16] can't uh you can't claim that from him
[44:18] force that from him that's God humbling
[44:21] himself by Grace it's God showing what's
[44:24] the desire in his heart because if God
[44:26] didn't desire to reveal himself to you
[44:28] and I we would know nothing about him
[44:29] amen we would have no clue we would have
[44:32] no understanding amen but God makes
[44:34] himself understandable Paul explains
[44:37] this in Romans 16. now he says to him
[44:39] that's a power to establish you
[44:41] according to my gospel and the preaching
[44:43] of Jesus Christ according to the
[44:45] revelation of the mystery the mystery
[44:48] which was Kept Secret since the world
[44:51] began so there's this great mystery
[44:53] that's that it's been a mystery it's
[44:55] been mysterious it's been misunderstood
[44:57] it hasn't been grasped since the
[44:59] beginning of the world Amen but now Paul
[45:02] says it's made manifest amen and by the
[45:05] scriptures of the prophets according to
[45:07] the Commandment of the Everlasting God
[45:10] is made known to All Nations for The
[45:13] Obedience of Faith amen so there was a
[45:16] mystery in God Amen there was a mystery
[45:18] in God nobody knew who he was but then
[45:21] by profit by prophet he begins to deal
[45:24] with his people we didn't as you've
[45:25] heard this from me before excuse me for
[45:27] repeating myself but we didn't know that
[45:29] God was a Healer amen until he
[45:31] manifested his healing and then we knew
[45:34] he was not only Jehovah he was Jehovah
[45:36] Rapha is that right we did not know God
[45:38] was a provider until Abraham felt a need
[45:40] amen and Abraham had a need that he
[45:42] could not supply himself amen so God
[45:45] provides a ram and by that provision we
[45:48] find out this is not just God it's God
[45:51] jairah Amen God my provider amen we
[45:55] didn't know all these things about him
[45:56] until God by his continually humbling
[45:59] himself continue really manifesting and
[46:01] revealing himself and changing masks and
[46:03] changing Mass God unravels all these
[46:06] mystery of who he was amen so once it
[46:08] was a mystery but in Jesus Christ Paul
[46:10] says it's made manifest
[46:12] amen and so that's what motivates God
[46:14] that's how we understand God
[46:16] is that uh not that we can truly
[46:18] understand him he's so great but we
[46:20] understand how he deals with us because
[46:22] his desire is to reveal himself
[46:26] that's his desire that's God's drive
[46:28] that's God's motive is to is to reveal
[46:31] himself that's what he wants amen so
[46:33] what does he do he keeps changing his
[46:35] mask he he changes mask he changes mask
[46:37] and he's playing out this great drama
[46:39] what is all this world about and all the
[46:41] all of human history and all these
[46:43] things what's it all about It's a drama
[46:45] amen amen God God God God loves a drama
[46:48] it's it's great story that's unfolding
[46:51] it's a romance amen how that God is just
[46:53] unfolding the secrets of his heart
[46:55] through this drama and he plays every
[46:56] part and he manifests himself and he
[46:58] changes mask and change his mask just
[47:00] like brother Braham said you could have
[47:02] one actor amen and you know one minute
[47:04] they're playing they're playing a a a
[47:06] Macbeth and the the other one they're
[47:08] playing you know King Lear or whatever
[47:10] but it's the same actor but they change
[47:12] a mask and they become a different
[47:14] expression amen but it's the same drama
[47:16] it's the same story right we know these
[47:18] things brother bran said he changes his
[47:21] mask he changes his act but he doesn't
[47:23] change his disposition
[47:25] amen I'm the Lord I change not amen he
[47:29] doesn't change his nature he just
[47:31] changes his mask from one to another and
[47:34] he does it why you say why he does it to
[47:37] reveal himself more plain to the people
[47:39] that they might know who he is and they
[47:42] might know what he is isn't that
[47:44] precious brother sister what's this
[47:46] whole thing about it's God wanting you
[47:48] to know him
[47:49] amen God wants to make himself more
[47:52] plain to us and that's what it that's
[47:54] that's the focus of this whole thing how
[47:56] many here know Christ this morning but
[47:57] you lift your hand by Grace I know Jesus
[48:00] Christ and he saved me and I know him
[48:02] and I have a relationship with him how
[48:04] do you think you could know who he is
[48:05] amen how could you know what he is amen
[48:09] if it was not his desire for you to know
[48:12] wrote right do any of us have Amen to
[48:15] form a relationship with God but it was
[48:17] God who initiated this thing no man ever
[48:20] sought God but God seeks man amen God
[48:24] seeks women God seeks boys and girls
[48:27] Amen to draw them unto himself and by
[48:30] Grace amen through through every mask
[48:33] through every Ministry through every
[48:35] member and every joint of this body he's
[48:37] supplying amen
[48:39] he's supplying this great drama he's
[48:42] playing this whole thing's unfolding why
[48:44] because God wants to know you amen and
[48:46] more importantly he wants you to know
[48:48] him hey man we shall know as we are
[48:52] known
[48:52] [Applause]
[48:53] hallelujah what a Perfection What A
[48:56] Perfection amen it's his desire it's his
[48:59] desire and that's something that's where

[49:05] message you know we we'll believe it
[49:07] we'll quote it we'll go to a message
[49:09] church we'll believe all these things
[49:10] but so sooner or later we got to wrap
[49:13] our minds around this fact it's his
[49:14] desire for you to know this it's his
[49:17] desire to reveal this to you it's his
[49:19] desire to take you out of whatever
[49:20] circumstances that you're in amen and
[49:23] transform you amen into the mask that he
[49:26] wants you to be so that he can make you
[49:28] amen his point of expression he wants to
[49:31] speak through you think through you act
[49:34] through you amen hallelujah it's his
[49:37] desire that's why he draw you out for
[49:39] this purpose that you might know him and
[49:41] he might use you amen so that someone
[49:43] else might know God in you amen you're

[50:20] something

[52:11] audible if he didn't want to be heard
[52:13] God would never made himself visible if
[52:15] he didn't want somebody to see him God
[52:18] would have never made himself touchable

[52:38] the feeling of our infirmities they did
[52:40] all these things that he might
[52:41] understand us we might be able to touch
[52:44] him amen
[52:45] that's what it's all about brother Bram

[52:49] it's been a work of God
[52:51] that's been covered up
[52:53] and it's been hid since the foundation
[52:55] of the world in a seven-fold mystery but
[52:58] God promised in this day in the age of
[53:01] the laodicean church he would take the
[53:03] mask off the whole thing

[1:00:15] that this thing is not just about what
[1:00:17] God looked like in Christ not just what
[1:00:20] God looked like in the apostles it's not
[1:00:22] just how he looked in the prophet what

[1:00:50] at the beginning all down through the
[1:00:53] centuries it's been a mystery but it's
[1:00:56] not a mystery now because he's spoken it
[1:00:58] into this world and he has created us
[1:01:01] new creatures in Christ to reveal
[1:01:04] himself not through the church not
[1:01:06] through the group but through the
[1:01:08] movement through the individual not
[1:01:10] through the movement but through the
[1:01:11] individual

[1:01:28] you the Holy Ghost so you can you can
[1:01:29] act like you know I'm 33
[1:01:32] he's not giving you the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:33] make you a 33 year old
[1:01:35] he wants to show the world
[1:01:44] amen he wants don't you understand he
[1:01:47] wants you

[1:15:36] a word that's promised today by some
[1:15:38] cold Creed of yesterday he said it

[1:16:44] those kind of things Jesus rebuked him
[1:16:46] amen he says your tradition it made the
[1:16:50] word of God another fact it wasn't even
[1:16:51] that they weren't preaching the word he

[1:17:59] way we're going to grow the only way
[1:18:00] will bear fruit

[1:20:33] trouble does he runs why because he
[1:20:35] doesn't own those sheep so brother so

[1:22:46] and it's not a lesser wage but it's a
[1:22:49] Pentecostal wage it's an Acts 2 age it's
[1:22:53] the Apostolic Pentecostal blessings
[1:22:56] which is the confirmation of the
[1:22:58] Resurrection
[1:22:59] but it's in you friends amen you're not

[1:23:59] rob you Christ is in this bride
[1:24:03] she's bone of his bone she's flesh of
[1:24:08] his flesh you think about that the Bible
[1:24:09] says he doesn't share his glory with
[1:24:11] another so how could it be Christ in you
[1:24:14] the hope of glory amen well I'll tell
[1:24:16] you it's a mystery when the two become
[1:24:18] one and he's not sharing his glory with
[1:24:20] another amen Christ in you glorifying
[1:24:23] himself amen that's not your glory so
[1:24:25] it's not robbery but it's Christ
[1:24:27] glorifying himself through you shining
[1:24:30] that light through you amen he doesn't
[1:24:32] share with anybody else what does that
[1:24:34] mean it means she's him you're him

[1:24:53] Queen of Heaven
[1:24:56] amen that's a quote you're the object of
[1:24:58] his affection you are the desire of his
[1:25:00] heart you are the focus of the word you
[1:25:04] are the Reason God raised up a prophet
[1:25:06] you are the Reason God calls fivefold
[1:25:08] Ministry a minister no matter how great
[1:25:10] he is the very word Minister means a
[1:25:12] servant who does he serve it's you no
[1:25:14] matter how great a prophet was his type
[1:25:16] in the Bible is a eunuch amen because it
[1:25:18] could not be he could not bring his own
[1:25:20] seed amen we're not feeding on the words
[1:25:22] of a man but the body word of the son of
[1:25:26] man has made you his Target his media
[1:25:29] he has made you his bride his Queen his
[1:25:32] beloved and is drawn you into himself
[1:25:35] that you might be identified with him
[1:25:37] amen and delivered amen from the
[1:25:40] consequences of your first birth your
[1:25:43] first husband that's dead now
[1:25:45] amen you live in him
[1:25:47] and so much greater he lives in you
[1:25:51] glory be to God Amen you're his desire
[1:25:54] you're what this message is all about
[1:25:55] don't get it twisted up friends look in
[1:25:58] the Book of Proverbs there you got
[1:25:59] Proverbs about you know it talks about
[1:26:00] foolish women it talks about evil women
[1:26:03] it talks about adulterous women yeah and
[1:26:05] the message talks about the problems
[1:26:07] with the Pentecostal denomination and
[1:26:09] the Baptist denomination and the
[1:26:10] Methodist denomination but that's not
[1:26:12] what it's all about because it comes
[1:26:14] down to the end he says but who can find
[1:26:16] a virtuous woman amen who can fight see
[1:26:19] where the passion see where the desire
[1:26:21] God's saying but where's my bride
[1:26:23] because her price is far above rubies
[1:26:28] see the message isn't all about what was
[1:26:30] wrong with denominations and what's
[1:26:32] wrong with what somebody else believes
[1:26:33] the message is God seeking a bride
[1:26:39] there is a bride there is a virtuous
[1:26:42] woman today that's your type
[1:26:45] amen her price is beyond rubies hey man
[1:26:48] you look at the you look at the uh amen
[1:26:50] how things were valued in the Old
[1:26:51] Testament and things rubies you know uh
[1:26:54] maybe it's not today we look at diamonds
[1:26:56] we look at Platinum things like that but
[1:26:57] the Bible says rubies is beyond gold
[1:26:59] Ruby's Beyond diamonds back then a ruby
[1:27:02] I I believe you could say it was the
[1:27:04] ultimate symbol of value it was the most
[1:27:07] precious material it was the most to be
[1:27:10] desired amen but this virtuous woman her
[1:27:13] value is beyond rubies it can't be human
[1:27:16] concepts of value and worth amen do not
[1:27:19] fit her amen she's beyond that she's
[1:27:22] lifted out of that Hallelujah she is his
[1:27:25] bride she's a blood red ruby and he paid
[1:27:29] the greatest Price ever shed Amen to
[1:27:32] purchase her and draw her unto himself
[1:27:35] you that's who you are to God you're his
[1:27:38] virtuous woman
[1:27:40] your price is beyond rubies amen quit
[1:27:43] measuring Yourself by human
[1:27:44] understanding human concepts of value
[1:27:47] and worth amen you got to recognize
[1:27:49] God's economy in God's economy the value
[1:27:52] is the price
[1:27:54] there's no inflation
[1:27:56] no there's no you know there's no
[1:27:59] markets there's no there's no
[1:28:01] stimulation and interest rates amen what
[1:28:04] you are worth is what God was willing to
[1:28:06] pay
[1:28:08] so you are that blood red ruby virtuous
[1:28:11] woman you are the Bro the bride of
[1:28:13] Christ you are the blood of God Amen he
[1:28:17] deemed you worthy he paid the price it
[1:28:21] was his desire that's what he thought
[1:28:23] about you that's what he thinks about me
[1:28:26] that's how he feels about his bride
[1:28:29] Hallelujah that's what he sent a message
[1:28:31] to tell us that you are the pure
[1:28:33] virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the
[1:28:36] Living God every man a woman that's born
[1:28:38] of the spirit of God and washed in the
[1:28:40] blood of Jesus Christ believes every
[1:28:42] word of God stands as though you never
[1:28:45] sinned in the first place you are
[1:28:49] perfect
[1:28:51] you are you are perfect how could that
[1:28:54] be true brother Nathan depends who you

[1:29:40] it's waiting for us to grasp this
[1:29:42] waiting for it to be revealed that's
[1:29:44] what brother Bram said if the church
[1:29:45] knew its position he said it will one
[1:29:48] day and then the Rapture will go
[1:29:51] when it knows what it is
[1:29:55] then the Rapture will come uh-huh
[1:29:57] when the bride realizes who she is the
[1:30:00] rapture goes

[1:38:35] brooding over me today I'm just afraid
[1:38:37] you know
[1:38:38] I'm afraid what he'll say
[1:38:40] I'm afraid of what he'll do to me
[1:38:42] I'm afraid I'll be punished I'm afraid
[1:38:44] I'll be hurt

[1:39:03] presence of God is an eternal light it
[1:39:06] never gets dim and never smokes up it's
[1:39:08] in that light man is always fresh old
[1:39:11] broken things become new and green and
[1:39:14] all of that in his presence
[1:39:17] but back then there was only one guy
[1:39:18] that could go in there that was the high
[1:39:20] priest you had to be a very special man
[1:39:22] among very special men
[1:39:25] to even peek through there and even he
[1:39:27] had to be afraid because if he got one
[1:39:29] little ritual wrong
[1:39:31] he'd fall over dead
[1:39:33] amen
[1:39:35] But realize you're tight friends you're

[1:39:48] he went in he ripped the veil from the
[1:39:50] top to the bottom and now it's not death
