word into our hearts and have your yes Lord Jesus amen I believe there's no greater honor that we could we could give him tonight that we would provide him and let him have his own way amen you know you think many times in the scripture when we look at the Simon had invited him to his house and Simon invited him there with the wrong purpose but yet Jesus had an appointment Simon wasn't even aware that there was a person coming that he would not have even allowed to darken his door if he had known beforehand but you know there was a woman that believed him to be the Messiah and that's the reason Jesus took that appointment to come to Simon's house because he knew she would be there the one that invited him did not welcome him but the one who was not invited welcomed him and that's exactly that where it is with our lives here as Gentiles we were not invited amen it was to the Jews but the hidden mystery was in there that God would bring about he would have a special meeting with every one of our lives and those who were uninvited by the covenants yet God knew each and every one of us that there would be a welcoming in our hearts of his life oh my it's more that Minds can comprehend it's a reality amen so we just we thank God for His mercy this evening and brother bill already mentioned it but I want to say welcome back sister Caroline's sister need it god bless you it's good to have you back [Applause] we are revoking your visa passport whatever that you need for Costa Rica its revoked with tonight we want to just in just a few moments we're going to turn our attention to the word and invite brother Sampson Shetty here from India we're so glad to have brother Sampson with us he's been coming by here for I believe brother Sampson mentioned to me today for seven years since since 2012 so we just certainly just counted an honor is a great friend amen of the congregation of ours here and so in a labor in the gospel so we just so appreciate what the Lord has done and is doing amen in the ministry there in India also want to make a also very important announcement I want to just tell my wife happy anniversary and then 21 years and the Lord has been so good to me I hope she can say the same thing but the Lord knew just exactly what I needed and I'm so glad that God he he watches over our lives to direct us and the decisions that we make men I really just appreciate her and truly you know without the help of the Lord we couldn't do what we do but I really could not do and stand as God has called me to stand without her and that's a truth she's there to she's right as a support she's right behind the vision and the work no matter what it is something comes on my heart she's ready to move right in it whether it's for the church here or it's you know elsewhere she's right in there with the vision and you know I know that that's not something that I have to persuade but that's what God has put in her heart it's a reality brother Ram said when God calls the man he calls the wife also Amen so we just thank God for all of his works and and tonight we I wanted brother Carlos had just requested before he comes but we would just have prayer with our brother tomorrow he is going to be going into surgery there in the morning and so we just want to just ask prayer and you might wonder we doing it at this time of the service well brother Carlos had requested it because tonight brother Trevor brother Trevor raise your hand now if you haven't seen brother Trevor just take a look at him he don't mind you staring at him but the Lord has really touched brother brother Trevor's heart and I don't even know brother Trevor when it was that that he'd given your heart to the Lord I was there in the hotel was it a month ago see he remembers second week of July and when the presence of the Lord just come right there in that hospital room and you know I believe it was a divine appointment I believe that and you just see even in his life the things we were even just the other day just testifying as what God is doing in his life just things just fleeing and we just thank God for his working amen God is a living God in him amen so the reason I said that is because brother Trevor's gonna be baptized tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so brother Carlos is gonna be a part of that so we want to just we want to invite brother Carlos just to come at this time and I'd like the brothers if the brothers would just come and we're just gonna gather around brother Carlos and we're just gonna just gonna pray with our brother amen I believe God's in control don't you Amen so appreciate brother Carlos and sister Irma amen really appreciate their lives and he-men their testimony amen I just just so appreciate him so very much we love him don't we amen or Jesus father as we just Lord come into this moment Lord very sacred moment father in your presence Lord Lord as you said in your word if the Lord God if two or three agree is touching any one thing it shall be done and father is our hands Lord God Lord would not be very much without Lord you dwelling behind the flesh Lord but father Lord you use Lord the branches Lord that God that have been birthed Lord from the vine and Lord as we lay our hands or God upon our brother Lord Jesus were asking father that Lord that you would just be with him Lord it's not hard for us to ask this because this is a promise that you made Lord that father you never leave him nor forsaking and Lord God I pray father that Lord God as tomorrow because we know that even Lord as it would come to that moment Lord it's nothing for you to dissolve Lord God father the issue Lord God in his body but father in any right you are the healer Lord God and so Lord we're just

is he all that you need how many come expecting amen God knows what our need is tonight amen he might use he might use a different nationality but he's still the same God Amen you know when you think about when Abraham was there in Genesis 18 Jena Abraham looked up and there was not one word that had even been uttered out of that vessel that the Lord was using but Abraham knew this was the visitation of the Lord not one word but he knew it was the Lord he was in contact with him there had been a promise he was going to come according to his promise God's made a promise in this hour you come according to his promise he comes according to every promise that he's made never late he's right on time so tonight maybe you might be a little weary you might be a little tired but if you can just say Lord let me just come out here to the edge of my tent door and start looking for you start looking for him to come according to his word and you'll see you with me tonight you'll see him you may not feel him but you'll see let's just let's look to the Lord ye he is all he is all that I yes Jesus is all that is all open irony he is all that I need Jesus she's all that I need and I take him

you know whatever you call India mission report 2019 so last year in 2018 after I went back home we had special meetings a brother from Zambia burner Emmanuel challi was with us and we had a special meetings ministers meeting in the morning and and evening regular service and many people attended hundreds and hundreds of people were there our church building was packed up and there was no more room inside of church so we put out tents outside and the people were sitting outside and before the people came to the altar when they when he was spraying for the sick people while they're walking towards him the presence of God was so powerful so rich and the people were like falling down you know and you know nobody you know done anything but the the presence of God was so powerful the people fell down and you know many people got healed you know so this is in our church so we are working on our chair in the church we are putting the ceiling especially in the summertime this year we had almost close to 120 degrees Farenheit summer which is 48 49 degrees Celsius so very hot so we try to do some sealing work so we have started but due to some financial situation so it was stopped right there so pre please pray for us pray for our you know sealing in the church and here some of the baptisms we believe in baptisms right we believe in water baptisms I don't know some of the churches in the message you know they banned baptisms and communion and feet washing and they said they're coming coming of the Lord is already done you know he already came I don't know all these strange doctrines but we believe in water baptism three divine ordinances water baptism Communion and feet washing amen so these people came out from Church of Christ you know the young boy young man nickel and supriya they accepted this message and got rebaptised praise the Lord so here you see in our church so we we had a special conventions in the month of January we had our church anniversary services here you see my family my lovely wife sister Swarna and also my eldest daughter sailor faith Suzanne Elizabeth and my son Samuel Larry and here you see in our church you know backside a brother from Ghana brother Thomas we had meeting with him in in the month of March so and here are some of the baptisms these people came from I mean they're there they are Indians but they are there they're living in Saudi Arabia and they are related to one of the family in our church so they came visiting us and they heard this message and the brothers introduced the message to them and they you know they accepted this truth and I think they are Presbyterians something like that denomination and they came out from that and they accepted this message and got rebaptised yeah and here is a problem you know that house you see in the other screen it's it is our Hindu neighbors located right beside of our church they are causing many problems and interrupting our services and they're like a big stumbling block right in the middle of the property so they were there since almost 35 40 years so before we started this church and you know had you know we built the building you know so these people we have paid for almost for their hundred square yards of land and that house we paid it's a you know we made an agreement they demanded more like 25,000 30,000 something like that but when we talk to them and motivated and convinced so it came to fifteen thousand US dollars so we paid $7,500 on that property and you know we made an agreement so we have to pay another 7500 and they said you know we will wait for for a while and they said you can pay in three three payments like three installments 2500 2500 and 2500 so please pray for this problem when brother Gary Walker was with us in 2017 they were there are the great problem you know they call all the Hindu radicals and canceled our meetings and try to put us in jail and all kinds of you know problem but we are still praying and moving so we request you to pray I ask the pastor also bless em and you know I surely believe prayer changes things and God answered prayers and here you see the meetings whenever we have meetings you

amen we believe in communion feet washing and baptism and here are some Sunday school children and my sister my younger sister and you know some of the sisters in the church they take care of the Sunday School ministry and here is our church and right beside of the church there is a land which is 250 square yards of property which is twenty two hundred and twenty two hundred fifty two thousand two hundred and fifty square foot so it is also ready for the sale so the owner called me and said you know it is good to you to buy this land because it is right beside of the church I don't want to see any other Hindu people come in you know buying that land one time one one company they try to come and you know buy that land and put some go down or whatever you call a fertilizer thing you know big haul and they aren't they want to store the fertilizers and all you know pesticides and all kinds of stuff I told them not to do that because we have a church and the families are living it smells

family and the church and the sister churches and the ministering Brethren they all send greetings to you all in the matchless and wonderful name of Jesus Christ so please would you stand with me for a moment let's read from numbers let's read from numbers chapter 17 and verse 1 to 8 numbers chapter 17 verse 1 to 8 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and take off every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the house of their fathers 12 rods write down every man's name upon his rod and thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where I will meet with you and it shall come to pass that the man's roared whom I shall choose shall blossom and I will make to cease from me the murmuring murmurings of the children of Israel whereby the murmur again sto and Moses speak unto the children of Israel and every one of their princes give him a rod apiece for each Prince one according to their fathers houses even 12 rods and the rod of Aaron was among their rods and Moses laid up the roars before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness and it came to pass that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness and behold the roar of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded and brought forth birds and bloomed blossoms and yielded ailments may the Lord and His blessings of reading of His Holy Word you may be seated says thank you this evening time the Lord willing if the Lord the Lord helps I believe I believe God helps me amen I would like to title this message in the presence of Shekinah glory in the presence of Shekinah glory Shekinah meaning the Shekinah the word in Hebrew it means dwelling blowing or presence the presence of God on earth the presence of God on earth and we believe that while brother Sam was praying for that brother Carlos we all came together and he mentioned in the prayers said that say what Jesus said Jesus said where two or three gathered together in his name he said I will be there in their midst that means the presence of God is with his people on the earth amen praise the Lord and my brothers and sisters Shekinah glory we are here in that wonderful name the name above all names the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the scripture says praise the Lord so here tonight we know this scripture we read many times and also we heard from from the message of the hour amen so my precious brothers and sisters here we read few scriptures and I would like to read a scripture from first Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 first Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who had called you out who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light praise the Lord precious brothers and sisters we all know that God had choosen Abraham he had choosen him when he was in in a when he was a Gentile right he was uh he was idol worshiper he was with his father he was in his land but God had chosen him when God chooses you and me when God had chosen you and me he has a process or a procedure a plan that he will separate you from it's not mingle with or mixed waita unbelief and belief and darkness and light and and and and and and some these goods on this bad when you mix something good and bad something comes out which is hybrid hallelujah I was reading just in passion of his brother branham said I don't care how good you are MA I don't care how good you are in the Christ is the mystery of God revealed I don't care what good things you do how good you are what good habits you have but if you are not according to the word which God promised for this day you are lost there are many good people I will show in India the people which were bombed brahmakumari is a big religious thing they are very clean neat they don't even kill and a bug and nothing film covering dress long hair no high heels no makeup no you know they don't eat meat they don't do any kind you know they don't harm they don't speak lie they they live in other words they they they follow their practice all ten commandments but they are not Christians they are not believers there are different religious people but they are good there that looks always they wear white dress full full covering dress and full nice piece always speak very good but you know what brother sister there are many good people in the denomination there are good people in different religions there are good people in different communities in different caste system different tribes and different kinds of people there in this world there are some good but brother branham said is not talking about the good things which is here upon the earth I don't care but if you are not according to the word amen if we are not according to the world you're lost Alleluia and 118 9 paragraph Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said outside of that I would like to read from you know the bride you know from the you know 187 he says the bride has to be the world for he is the world she cannot stand on Creed's she cannot stand on denomination she cannot stand on good behavior Wow powerful good behavior she has to stand alone are the world if it looks good or bad to the people those who are in the outside in the denomination in the in other religions I don't care every believer every Christian pleases God he please she please God because without faith it is impossible to please God what is the faith faith is a revelation faith which we believe that is the faith which we see unseen you know that is a super sense that is in in the inside hey man amen so my brothers and sisters I'm not very good in English but please bear with my grammar and bear with my accent and pronunciation of vocabulary whatever it is but but I'm not complaining when the anointing comes God like this - brother Sam told me you know he said you know the same God is here tonight the same God is in the upper room you know hallelujah he will give you the wisdom and understanding what what if I speak in Telugu you will understand in English hey man the same God amen and amen see because she is a part of it she was taken from Christ see and to be sure that the world rapture now Luther was a part Wesley was a part the prophets was a part amen and here again I want to read 189 he said outside of that you are lost I don't care how good you are or what your relationship is or what your fellowship is or what your organization is you are lost ma when I read this quote I was thinking about all different religious people different denominational people different people they are saying that like ha like a young man came to Jesus running and kneeled down it is in the presence of God and said good master what shall I do for to inherit the eternal ah and Jesus said how you call me good there is only good Jesus that is God Hey and he said jesus said go and just you know do all the 10 commandments obey or practice or follow what what the law says and he said I'm doing that when I was since my young going to Sunday school youth meetings and everything and he was growing but when he came to the revealed word hallelujah when God became flesh and dwelt among us when God become flesh hallelujah when God became flesh and came and this man was lacking something but he didn't know that the same thing with us tonight also my brother sister maybe we think we are all right we are praying we are studying we are reading we are we are we are doing everything what the prophet said and we know the same thing that young man he was a message believer he was a message believer he believed in profit that profit is Moses and his reading course he's reading his scriptures is reading praying and doing everything good but he has to come into the order of a divine order which God provided for that day a men are men nothing like this message hallelujah praise his wonderful name here are my brothers and sisters in the presence of Shekinah glory the or drive stick when they brought all the 12 sticks into the presence of God the dried stick nothing in there no life in there not moving no blooms no blossoms no leaves no fruit nothing but God said to bring that into my presence and lay there my brothers and sisters here we read this first Peter chapter 2 verse 9 the same scripture it was written in the Old Testament in Deuteronomy and that scripture was for Israel prophet Moses the same scripture is using is speaking about the Israel people the natural Israel but when it came here in the New Testament even this man he couldn't write his own name like an educator a Fisher man by the revelation of Jesus Christ he's writing the same Scripture hallelujah and is saying that you is pointing this scripture to the people those who are Gentiles hallelujah he said ye are a chosen generation the same scripture was mentioned it was said to Israel and now the same scripture it is mentioned here he wrote in the New Testament here you don't see this is for Jews only now this is not for Israel this is not for Jews only in Deuteronomy it was for Jews and the Jewish people or Israel people and natural Abraham seed they thought that this is the scripture only belongs to us only this brick this scripture belongs to only for us not for any other nation only only for Israel not for India not for America not for Africa they are not chosen generation in the Old Testament God had chosen them but God chosen ever hand from Chaldean land and God brought him from Gentile and he made them he made him a nation out of Abraham God made you know at twelve tribes in the twelve tribes you see you know my precious brothers and sister please bear with me tonight I don't want to take much time I know this is a midweek service so God had chosen Abraham and from him 12 tribes and God chosen Levi a tribe of Levi for priesthood to do ministry in the tabernacle he heeded appointed or elected or choosing any other tribe to come into the presence or into the tabernacle to do the ministry in the church or in the mean in the in the tabernacle in the temple just only Levi we all want that one time was ayah he thought I'm doing good I'm rolling nice and my kingdom is good the Lord blessed me and blessed and he thought I can take some offerings into the temple I can do this I am eligible to this to do this and worthy to do this but you know what brothers and sisters that is not God's that wasn't God's divine order God has never called him for that purpose but never whatever you know whatever calling you have in your life whatever whatever ministry God that God placed in your in your life if God called you as a lay member if God called you as a song leader if God called you as a minister if God called you as a deacon trustee if God called you first for certain thing Bella Branham said you got to stay in your position you have to stay in your position and and rest of the priest said to Isaiah sir King we respect you we honor you but this is not your duty this is not your duty to come into the to the tabernacle or to the temple and take up this all the offering going into into the presence of God this is not you to do this you're not called to do to do this praise the Lord hallelujah but he didn't care and he said oh no I can do this but when he went into the temple the Lord cursed him with the leprosy so that means we came to understand that only the levi's are appointed are called to do the ministry in the presence of Almighty God one time David was trying to bring that that arc from Philistines and he put that arc in the on the new ox cart it shouldn't be that way it has to be in another way which God provided way it has to be laid or or you know carried on the Levi's shoulders but Darrell thought that I'm a king God can understand me you know but that's not God's order it's not God's divine order it has to come on the Levi's shoulders so hope you're catching my thought so what about us tonight what about us tonight see we are like the or not belongs to Abraham's you know naturally speaking we are not belong to any Abraham family we are Gentiles Jewish people they eat different kind they eat certain certain things but we eat all all things some of the Indian people they don't eat pork most of the Indian people they don't eat pork they don't eat beef they have their you know traditions cultures customs and way of doing things everything is different but see my brothers and sisters when you read this scripture first Peter 2:9 how come that we are chosen generation a royal priesthood kings and priests are an holy nation a peculiar people praise the Lord so my brothers and sisters in the Old Testament God chosen Kings and brought Kings raised up Kings from Judah tribe and God raised a ministers or high priests priests and high priests from Levi's tribe or Levi's community god has men our different ways and he put that everything in order he instructed God instructed to Moses to do this do that do this do that and you need to put everything see I would like to read in Hebrews chapter 7 I mean Hebrews chapter 9 let's read here he said you know chapter 9 and verse 1 to 4 then really the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first variant was the candlestick and the table and the sherbert which is called the sanctuary and after the second whale the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censer and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid and round a boat with gold and varen was the golden pot that had manna and Aaron's rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant so here st. Paul is explaining or writing about the old tabernacle which has three cords like outer public and and holiest of Holies and holiest of Holies you know so whatever God told Moses to keep in order everything was in order and in the especially in the holiest of Holies you see we read here there was a candle you know the golden part with manna and Aaron's roared and also tables of the Covenant the 10 commandments that's the natural so brother branham's said about the three rooms house natural types spiritual three rooms house every house has three rooms God works in three in three comings three sons names and three offices everything is three three three you know so here you see the tabernacle in them in the wilderness it was you know Hara I don't know how to put in English it's a in the three parts right yeah one two three you know so everyone can come into the you know first you know first what you call first room or first court and some people can come into the holiest of you know the holy place you know where the candlestick and through bread but when you you know if you read here to the down you know if you read further you see that the high priest only high priest once a year he's entering into the holiest of Holies and when he was going there they put a robe to him or a big what you call that thing wrong if he has done anything wrong a mistake or sinned when he went into into the holiest of Holies if he dies nobody is going to run into that you know sacred place where the Shekinah glory in the presence of Shekinah glory God said I am going to come and meet you there aha it's not for everyone your guests may come to your kitchen and they eat there they go to the living room and fellowship and talk but the bedroom is not for everyone hope you're catching my word so we help to realize who we are now how we came how we become a royal priesthood even our Lord Jesus Christ wasn't he was not came from Levi stripe he wasn't if you if you if you read the scripture he was he was not he was not a priest community he wasn't belongs to a priest community but here one I preached this message in in my church and by the help of the Lord and the I asked the people in my church I asked them how we become a royal priesthood how we become a king kings and priests how come and our people you know some of the ministers and the believers in the church they said by Jesus Christ I said even Jesus Christ is not belongs to priesthood community naturally speaking but how God made us if you read in revelations chapter five let's go to that little relation chapter five the seven sealed book amen chapter five and verse nine and ten and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred not only from Jews not only from you know Abraham natural seed but every kindred and tongue Telugu Hindi Marathi Spanish British English everything every tongue and people and nation and has made us has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth the same holy spirit-inspired the same holy spirit which was in Moses after the dispensational change it came into the disciples Peter here is writing the same scripture which was written Jesus Christ was same yesterday today and forever so in the Old Testament the same scripture was written for natural seed of Abraham and in the New Testament it will it is written for a spiritual seed of Abraham which is we today amen so how we become a spiritual seed like a kings and priests in India we have cast a system we have a communities different caste different communities different tribes different things you know and we have our kings community also when they have a you know big celebration the Kings are like a big and everything is and we have a priest community also audience when they tested their DNA the blur and all these they found that their fathers came from Jews I mean Israel from Aaronic you know family from Lima so when this Israel or Abraham C natural seed was scattered all over the world they went to they came to India also so I'm not talking about the natural thing but here tonight my precious brothers and sisters we are a spiritual kings and priests and Jesus Christ made us unto God a kings and priests to reign forever praise the name of the Lord but my question I asked in my church I said how we become a it's not a Christian thing how we become priests how we become pings they said Jesus Christ okay when you search the Scriptures Jesus came from Abraham you know family but not from Levi's tribe he came from Judah praise the Lord of course you know my precious brothers and sisters but tonight this evening and just whatever the Lord puts on my heart I'm just sharing with you hope you are catching my thought this evening so but here we read well brother branham said if we have a bible question there is a Bible answer a man so it is not that we came or Jesus Christ our Lord Jesus came through Aaronic priesthood divine order but there is another greater than Aaronic priesthood order a divine order which is Melchizedek a man and we read here hebrews chapter 7 and it says chapter 1 i'm in chapter 7 and verse 1 for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the Most High God he was king and he was priest oh my two tribes to communities or two categories or two things or in one person praise the Lord who is this Melchizedek you know all these brother branham preach that message who is this Melchizedek mm-hm and here we read here for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the Most High God who made Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham Abraham gave a tenth part of all force being by in interpretation King all righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace Abraham had our divine revelation after ever had won the war won the battle after that not before after returning back home hallelujah after returning back home now he was so tired of war he was so tired physically maybe in everything you know you were so tired coming back home and now he met a king king of Salem king of righteousness king of peace and whenever had met him ever ever ham I told in my church even the tenth part the tights before the law was given to us it's a divine revelation of a Christian believer it's not just it says the world Testament says that no before the law was given by Moses the tenth part was given by Abraham to you know to Melchizedek it's a divine revelation Abraham he didn't get only money but also his time he didn't give his only his time also his talent talents not only tells his efforts not only that but he worshiped God he knew that is not only the king is also the priest he's not only the priest is also king he is worthy to be praised and he's worthy to take my offering hoo-wah praise the name of the Lord before the law was given by Moses it's not he didn't went to school he didn't went to a church Indian went to a service he went he didn't sit under the pastor are listening all these you have to do this you have to do that no no but he's got the revelation the personal revelation Homa that personal revelation brings you into the presence of God that pulls you hallelujah that pulls you that draws you into the presence of God hallelujah and he met Melchizedek and the Melchizedek y-you know the scripture says here here without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually amen and here the scripture says in the you know Book of Psalms chapter 110 and verse 4 the Lord had sworn and will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek this was a prophecy this was a prophecy was you know said in the Book of Psalms from whom for witness is talking about this this was a prophecy given in the Book of Psalms is talking about our Lord Jesus Christ amen so even though he wasn't came from Levi tribe hallelujah but he had he came in a divine order of melchizedek so by Jesus Christ by him not by law not by Moses law but by the grace of God so that's the reason Paul said here the scriptures also said we were not a people unto God but by faith in the Son of God this afternoon hallelujah praise the Lord I enjoyed we had a wonderful conversation wonderful fellowship this afternoon in with brother Sam and also brother Andrew we have our faith and there is God's faith God's faith your faith human faith faith in pastor faith in man of God faith in the word faith in the message all this you know so brother sister this evening time we got to know Bella Branham said when the church when the bride knows her position and then she will go in the rapture and there are some you know people has to come in like the prophet of God said in the seven seals book he said he is still working as an intercessor and to God standing between you know in the middle to God and to the people in the Shekinah glory is doing mediator she preaches high priest duty is working as a high priest [Music] taking his all blurred into the presence of God he entered into the presence for whom for his own bride for his own people to make them to bring them to make them to mold them to two you know naturally it is impossible to change your caste or your surname it's impossible but he changed your surname he changed my surname he changed my blood bloodline whatever you call you know he changed my my attitude he changed my character he changed my nature he changed everything oh my when he dropped me in the bleach oh my sins has gone nope praise His Holy Name he changed naturally it is impossible you can't change your passport you can't change your you know moles or your identifications you can't change anything but our Lord Jesus Christ by the new birth and by the new birth new burst is a divine revelation a personal revelation to each believer it is impossible to explain but you know sometimes we people think that you know we will you know sometimes we will judge the people or it's not born again she is not born again it will do that but you know what when when my son was born when my daughter's was born they were not perfect naturally speaking they're trying to walk they weren't trying to say man mom mommy you know their daddy you know their if you say something to them no you're not speaking right you got to speak right no that's not the thing hope you're catching my so when when they were born still the new birth has a process going through the process walking walking talking we did some mistakes see like like disciples Jesus called come Simon I will make you a fisherman and your name will be Simon not assignment now now Peter come and follow me come Matthew come Levi come Philip come you all come and follow me and they all came and they were with Jesus Christ for three and a half years and their fellowshipping and eating together sitting together and and then going in the board together and and still they have their problems all kinds of problems but I don't think I don't said that they were not born again they are already born again hallelujah but they are going through the process the new birth and also God's prophet said there's a difference between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the new birth baptism of the Holy Spirit puts you in the position in the body of Jesus Christ but the new birth when you fully I'm in perfect faith then you believe him when you have faith in Him it's not like I believe Jesus Christ oh I believe it all no no no not saying like that but from bottom of your heart no shut off doubt when you have faith that's faith creates the new birth in you that's what the prophets there and see and there were new they were born again but they're having some issues they have some they had some problems who's who is greater than me Peter said I'm greater than you gaiter than me a greater than me you know everybody's having a problem but my brother's sister tonight there we're waiting for the promise of God and they waited in the upper room for 10 days for what god is blessing them in the body of Christ their positionally they're going to be established they're waiting for the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming in hallelujah hope you're catching mine so it is not a natural thing but also when you search the Scriptures so God is not you know I mean I'm trying to you know catch translate the things in my mind and you know Paul it is not that like how God never changes his pattern never changes his plan he never changes his divine orders but he a brother/sister what happens we all thought maybe the Israel people may thought that Oh God is not God for everyone these God only for for us but Paul said now we are going to Gentiles I'm leaving you Jews or Israel and living I'm going to Gentiles now praise the Lord God turned to Gentile and this Gentile dispensing dispensation is going to finish complete and now God is turning back to juice again from natural to spiritual and to spiritual to the natural again this gospel came from east and going back to east again so precious brothers and sisters here there's a greater priesthood than Aaronic and it says here in your ninth verse chapter 7 and verse 9 and as I may so say Levi also who receiveth ties paid tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him so fourth-generation huh Levi wasn't born yet but he was in Abraham's loins but met Abraham met milk acidic Leroy also paid tithes with his great-grandfather to Melchizedek even though he is going to be in the future is going to be a priest Liva even though he was is going to be a priest but the priest a natural priest was in now Abraham and paid tied to Melchizedek that means it's a greater priesthood than Aaron priesthood or Levi praise the Lord so we came from that lineage we didn't came from Abraham's natural-like Isaac and Jacob and twelve tribes and Lyra and our Judah no no but we came to Christ but this is the scriptural proof evidence to every Christian message believer hallelujah that is our rights claiming our rights now we have right to say by the blood of Jesus Christ I am the priest and the King what King does he has Authority so that's why Jesus said speak to this mountain Lazar come out it's proving that how an authority by my word like how brother Branham described he said you know traffic policy say he stands in the row I mean in the center of the you know that what you call that you know Inter's an intersection and he he he just say like the hurt and big truck will stop there he don't have a strength or power or ability to stop the track no no no but the power no authority the same thing the Kings Jesus Christ is the king of kings so that's why he stood up why are you bothered what are you what for what your what what's happening here how long I will be with you Oh master o Lord we are going to sink in this scene Galilee or we are going to die Oh master he just stood up and said become Alleluia just and they said who who is this man is not a man something inside of him the king is the ruler of this universe and he made you and me to be a ruler a ruler he gave us an authority on cancer he gave us an authority on and and our heart disease he gave us an authority on blood pressure he gave us an authority on all sickness and disease and afflictions he gave us an authority because he became he-man us a prince and priests please to come into the presence of God praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah my brothers and sisters in the number 17 chapter so every rod was written the name was written on on the rods but when it came to Aaron's rod Levi's rod I I said it says Bible says Levi's rod when it brought into the presence the Levi's rod God said right Aaron's name on that rod not bone food Lima just put Aaron hallelujah even though we were not belongs to him I mean naturally we were messed up we bypassed our t off when he came into this world speaking lies and you know born in sin and you know and came to this this this life in in in a in a you know ya worldly way but God had chosen you and me before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world before you were born before I was born before we were born he already paid a price in advance powerful he paid a price before the foundation of the world and he put a name no even the Hebrew scholars could never pronounce that name a name above all names it's not a name of Aaron it's not name of the fathers of their household is not the name of their princess it's not the name of the denomination it's not the name of their country it's not the name of their genealogy the big patriarch law it's the name of God hallelujah specifically God put the name of Aaron's on Levites rod hallelujah he didn't put the Levi's the same way we came out from that Tree of Life when the Tree of Life was you know the branch was cut off so that's why Jesus said I am the wine and ye are the branches so that means the wine is that wine the tree is the Tree of Life their Lord Jesus Christ and when we were separated how we were separated by sin unbelief the sin and he belief separated from God separated you and me separated us from God and we will cut off and separated from God and we become you know in the wilderness or in the desert like a dried stick we were totally in a deadly not moving here and there but by God's sovereign grace not by our abilities not by our power not by our religious or righteousness or good things could be every good good good good things what we have done no it's by almighty God's grace that by God's grace we were brought into the Shekinah glory one time Jacob he was a deceiver he deceived his father-in-law he deceived his is his brother he deceived his father he deceived everyone and that time you know when he was you know something driving something something pushing something pulling him something making him and you know he's like uh something lacking him and he was longing he was looking for something that that that which is you know he didn't find in this world he want to meet that person who can satisfy his soul who can give him that eternal life and that time of pinwheel you know the place Reebok I know Reebok a place called I don't know what you call here but you know he came to that place you know pinwheel and he was laying right there in that wilderness all the night like a dried stick dried rot and he was wrestling with God wrestling with God he found God in pray all the night he was wrestling wrestling wrestling wrestling playing God and Lord you you bless me money no he has money family yes family servants animals gold silver everything what is looking for a new burst eternity eternal life he's not looking for something on this world is not expecting something from this world hallelujah is looking for something beyond beyond this world for the birthright he was fighting to get their birthright natural birthright he got from his your father and that never satisfied him but inside of the inside God is dealing with his soul and he was laying right there in the presence of Shekinah glory as a dry steak and God came right there and he said I will meet you and he came and they were you know he was wrestling with God and God asked him hey so you are asking for the blessing okay what's your name Lord I'm asking for the blessing and you are asking me my name he then said that he knew it has to be that way it is not easy to you and me to come into the presence and Lord give me this Lord give me that no no no you have to confess your wrongs and mistakes and our unbelief on whatever we done our shortcomings or trials or ha you know alcohols of mistakes the Bible says it is not that you know those who confess their mistakes or wrong sir you know those who confess they will prosper amen so when God asked him what's your name when his natural father asked him what's your name Oh him he's a father I brought your nice meat here you know I just went to hunting he don't know you don't have an idea about that but he said he's saying that father I brought a nice meat I'm your son I shall see heal me he was blind he Isaac was blind but hear my brothers and sister their heavenly father came down he deceived his natural father but when he when the heavenly father came down he was asking what's your name now he can't move there is no chance he can't deceive him because he knew everything he knew every thought he knew every move he knew whatever we are doing we are helpless we are weak we are falling stumbling moving here and there helpless he knew that but he's not putting you on the spot but you know my brother sister he wants us to confess what's your name lord I am deceiver God is bringing you and me to that position to be humbling ourselves to be sincere in the presence of God when you meet God there is something going to happen brother sister and genuine heart sincere honest heart God is looking at his confession oh you're confessing right you're not lying unto me like your natural father like your brother you know you did to your brother your father your all this but you're not but he was a dry stick and God Himself came down and he asked the name and when he confessed then he rubbed or scratched or delete or erased that name which is Jacob and in the presence of Shekinah glory he's writing the name now you will be no more called Jacob now you will be called Prince Prince what is Prince King in the presence of Shekinah glory in the presence of Shekinah glory he brought us out from the darkness brother he brought us we never dreamed we're never expected we never thought about that we never asked for that helpless we don't know what time you born here we don't know what time we are going to die I mean passed away we don't know what next hour is going to happen helpless but God knows he took out he erased or deleted or rubbed or scratched that old name varam said the old nature old character all life scratched and put his name he said Prince now you will be called Israel which means Prince Prince means son of the king the drive stick bloomed blossom got loose and when he was went to to the to that place and he was walking like fancy you know like a model like a movie actor or some kind of some kind of stylish you know but when he met God something happened became humble becomes simple hey yesterday you were lying right but today something happened brother branham said when you meet God it changes everything changes everything changes the nature changes the character changes the attitude changes the behavior changes to your heart changes your life everything because the transformation power is in the Lord Jesus Christ when he comes not only going you know just coming in the church like sitting in like a kitchen no just like her in a sanctuary in a living room fellowship no just entering into the fellowship enter into the fellowship enter which means it's not like coming to the altar coming in on to the pulpit but spiritually speaking let him come to you and let us go into him say so that's the reason prophet of God said you are not only engaged to Christ you are married to Christ and bringing forth the children bringing forth the fruit fruit and the fruit the life is not in the church it's in the man the husband the husband gives you the life then how come if you are as been there and if you here you are naturally you all know that we can't do any good no children nothing but when they go into the bedroom I mean spiritually speaking but you know something happens hallelujah router quote justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy spirit inside of the inside body no in chronicles seventh chapter verse 14 it says I will put my name there forever his name forever if he would have if he put his name on this flesh on the brains it won't be forever maybe if you put here it will be for 70 or 80 or 100 years then his closest is gone but is going from body spirit and the soul inside of the heart is putting his name there forever missus Jesus Christ I hope you're catching mine so I don't want to you know go more theory it is almost 5 to 9 so my precious brothers and sisters I have a quotes here but you know can I read one quote yeah so so here brother branham in the message called the greater than Solomon is here 1963 he preached he said when Solomon prayed he prayed Lord if thy people anywhere be in trouble and look towards his holy mountain or this holy place and pray then hear from heaven and Jonah had confidence that God heard the prayer of Solomon because he was a servant of God and if we could have that much faith upon the prayer of a man that was dedicating an earthly temple and a man praying the prayer that family in his life back slate and under them circumstances with them kind of symptoms could have that much confidence that God would hear his prayer how much more out we today was sitting in the presence of the resurrected Jesus Christ look away from our symptoms to the heaven itself where Jesus sits at the right hand of God with his own blood to make intercessors upon our confession upon our confession Jacob Israel I believe that is presence here now to set me free from any bondage that Satan put upon me and I look to where he sits at the right hand of God ever living to make intercession to me with his own blood as a high priest he sits there and how much more out.we to look to the holy place of God with Jesus himself our mediator the only one between God and man stands with his own blood to make intercession on other confessions a man a man me so be it I believe it it with all my heart praise His Holy Name saints of God in the presence of Shekinah glory we are plumed we are presumed prophet said is not the wine bringeth forth fruit but the branches so he said I am the wine he are the branches The Tree of Life we came from him and again we are going back to him so that's why he said I leave so ye shall be also and also he said now you are coming into that union and also the prophet of God said in this crisis the mystery of God revealed I read many times their scriptures st. John 14 20 but brother Branham how the revelation came he said it that day he shall know that I am in my father oneness is speaking about the unity or the oneness I am in my father and father in me and I he said now brother Branham said now it's I in you you in me he shall know ha wonderful praise the name of the Lord don't you love him for that don't you love him for what he has done for us don't you love him for what he's doing right now in the present-day don't you love him for what is going to do for us in the future we love him with all our heart thank you Lord Jesus praise His Holy Name praise the Lord I turned the service to the man of God praise His Holy Name hallelujah amen I mean enjoyed the word of the Lord tonight amen what what grace what grace is given to us amen and how God will how God works within a life and it's truly it's truly a process and whatever God starts he will finish it he will finish it and you know it's just the reality is let him finish let him do what what he began amen just that we were just talking the other night and we were just you know the the the illustration that brother branham used so many times when he would deal with that of God taking a hold of a life and he would liken that to a cup that the Lord would pick up that cup that would be maybe in a chicken yard or somewhere and the cup is so filthy when he picks it up when you pick it up you still has all the filth as soon as all the desires about it that's the Brotherhood that's what the Lord was bringing out tonight that's justification amen a person believes on the Lord Jesus Christ God's dealing their heart it's the same Holy Spirit dealing with the life but it's the call is not just to be a dirty cop but it's that now the one who picked it up is the one who will clean it up and he cleans that cup up the cup doesn't clean itself he cleans it sanctification is the process of the person of Jesus Christ him working in our life for the ultimate purpose why did he pick me up in the beginning because he wanted to use me he wanted to fill me up with his own life and there's not one of us in here that would drink out of a dirty cup nobody would I don't believe anybody would you drink only out of a clean cup you know how it is sometimes you get out of the you get out of the cabinet you can take a cup out of there and you can look at it sometimes you might see something in oh the dishwasher didn't get this one so you put it in the sink and maybe you'll scrub it a little bit because the dishwasher didn't get it you'd get it clean why do you do it cuz you're not gonna drink out of it and God Himself when he reaches down and picks up that life by his presence he then cleanses it he cleans it of every habit everything of the world he cleans it and then he comes inside of it to dwell that's why the scripture says we are his workmanship amen we were not our own work we are his signature addition a man or work of the master himself amen so here tonight we're gonna witness in you know of a baptism here tonight where God has taken a hold of a heart that is surrendered to him brother Trevor as they go ahead and make their way he he surrendered his heart to the Lord and God just working in his life God has a full purpose just like he has within every every one of our lives amen so we're just thankful to God for that we are walking in as our brother walks into the water of baptism tonight he is identifying a man with the death in the burial and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ amen with the promise that if we repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost anybody ever worked for a birthday gift if you did it wasn't a gift somebody tricked you but if it's a birthday gift it's got your name on it and it's a gift you didn't earn it you didn't merit it and that's the way that the Holy Ghost is you can't earn it you can't merit it you can't be good enough it is sovereignly given with our name on it amen so we just are so thankful to the Lord tonight for for brother Trevor and the stand that that he's taken here god bless Chevy each and every one of you this my son-in-law Trevor Warren and which is so thankful for the Lord that God is doing in his life I could say one thing that I had nothing to do with it this is a hole of one could call this way the scripture says over in the book of Acts talks about that everyone the God is the ordained to eternal life those are the people added to the church I'm so thankful that it's not a work of man because if it was the work of man would probably have all the pews all fall over the year but there's a little thankful that God is the one doing the work and he gets the glory he gets all the honor and all the credit belongs to him we're just just instruments of God God has hands and feet on this earth and we are in so we let's just pray Heavenly Father is we come before the father or God this evening just so thankful father love God for your word father little Godman to come father to minister unto us so father this evening Lord Lord this is a special moment found a little God Lord because one was lost and now is found found a little God you went father and you reached out to him father lo God he never reached out to you God because we're the ones as long he's you're not father no God so we're thankful father for everything that you're doing father and we're under expectation father that you will continue to work in his life often Oh God as we come this evening father little God to commit him into your hands o Lord we ask you bless him bless his family father Lord God Lord s from this point on father we march on father marching on father because that's what we become is just an army of the Living God so we commit him into your hands father in the name of Jesus Christ amen other commissioners given unto us did you keep a commandment to go out and baptize and your name father o God we commit trevor Boren and unto you father and we baptize him father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ glory be to God amen amen amen amen praise the Lord glory be to God amen the church say you man
