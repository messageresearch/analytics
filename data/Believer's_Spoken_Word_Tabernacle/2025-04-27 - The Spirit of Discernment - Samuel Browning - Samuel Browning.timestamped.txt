[22:59] [Music]
[23:04] Uh this is
[23:05] a I'm going to rebound this. This is a
[23:09] after Easter song.
[23:12] You know, you remember the Cleopus and
[23:14] his friends was walking down the road
[23:17] one day and they were so sad. That's
[23:21] right. Their Lord had died. You know,
[23:24] the one they had a lot of faith in. They
[23:26] didn't know what to do. A man
[23:29] stepped out of the the bushes.
[23:33] And he expounded to them
[23:37] all the things that the prophets had
[23:38] wrote that would happen and it still
[23:40] didn't reach him. He done that all the
[23:43] way down the road till the evening time.
[23:46] They went to eat and he was continuing
[23:47] to walk. They come on in and have supper
[23:50] with
[23:51] us. when he went in and broke bread and
[23:55] blessed
[23:56] it, then their eyes were open. That's
[24:00] like us in the end
[24:03] time. It wasn't We'd heard Jesus all
[24:05] through our life, preachers and
[24:09] churches, but it wasn't until the bread
[24:11] was broke when the prophet of God came.
[24:15] God broke the bread and blessed it in
[24:17] that instant opened up our eyes.
[24:21] Pray for me.
[24:26] The
[24:27] day before
[24:30] [Music]
[24:33] yesterday they crucified my
[24:40] Lord, beat him un mercifully.
[24:48] nailed him to a
[24:52] tree. The sky grew dark and the
[24:58] earth began to
[25:00] [Music]
[25:06] fall. People
[25:08] cried.
[25:13] Surely they've
[25:16] crucified the son of
[25:23] God. Why didn't we
[25:28] recognize the
[25:30] mighty God was here today?
[25:38] Did not our
[25:42] heart
[25:44] burn as he talked
[25:48] along the
[25:53] way. Shouldn't we have known
[25:59] him? Surely we should have known
[26:04] him.
[26:06] Surely we should have known
[26:10] him before our Lord had come and
[26:23] gone. A friend and
[26:28] I walk down the road.
[26:35] didn't know our
[26:39] Lord had a
[26:45] rose. But a man drew
[26:49] near and he
[26:52] spoke word so
[26:54] [Music]
[26:59] wise. He broke the bread and he blessed
[27:07] it. And at that step he opened up our
[27:16] eyes. Why didn't we
[27:21] recognize the
[27:23] mighty God was here today?
[27:31] Did not our
[27:35] hearts
[27:37] burn as Jesus taught
[27:41] along the
[27:43] [Music]
[27:46] way. Should we have known
[27:53] him? I wish we would have known him.
[28:00] Surely we should have known him before
[28:05] our Lord had come and gone.
[28:14] [Music]
[28:18] [Applause]
[28:19] [Music]
[28:20] [Applause]
[28:29] [Music]
[28:38] that last verse there. I want to say
[28:40] that the last part. Amen. The story
[28:42] doesn't end there,
[28:44] right? Amen. How many's
[28:47] recognized the son of God has risen in
[28:49] our midst today? Hallelujah.
[28:52] I'm so glad that I
[28:57] recognize the mighty
[29:00] God. He's here
[29:06] today. Doesn't our
[29:10] hearts
[29:13] burn as he talks along the way.
[29:18] [Music]
[29:22] Oh, I'm so glad I
[29:25] know.
[29:27] Hallelujah. Yes. I'm so glad I
[29:32] [Music]
[29:35] know. I'm so glad I know
[29:39] him. Soon he'll come and I'll be gone.
[29:51] I
[29:54] recognize the mighty
[29:57] God. He's here today.
[30:01] [Music]
[30:11] as he talks along the
[30:18] way. Oh, I'm so glad I know. Oh, testify
[30:24] this morning, church. Yes. I'm so
[30:27] glad I
[30:32] know. I'm so glad I know you.

[30:47] soon.
[30:53] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. As
[30:56] brother Samuel gets ready to come.
[30:58] Looking forward to the word this
[31:00] morning. Best part of the service. Amen.
[31:03] Receiving the word of God into our
[31:04] souls. Amen. And let's sing that little
[31:06] song. I got leaving on my mind.
[31:08] Hallelujah.
[31:10] Amen. They can have the economy. They
[31:13] can have the deficit.
[31:15] They can have all the problems. I got
[31:17] leaving on my mind. Amen.
[31:23] The old
[31:25] house that I'm living
[31:29] in is
[31:32] needing repair.
[31:37] Oh, the windows
[31:39] and the
[31:43] shutters are in the
[31:46] [Applause]
[31:50] cold. I say to
[31:53] myself, don't fix
[31:56] it. Oh, when I can find the time.
[32:05] But all I
[32:11] can
[32:13] [Music]
[32:21] is all our God
[32:26] is with all
[32:31] [Music]
[32:34] Yes, Lord. Oh, it
[32:37] seems that's all I'm
[32:40] thinking
[32:43] [Music]
[32:44] about. So much of
[32:48] it. I'll be soon and be
[32:55] soon. I'll leave my
[32:58] troubles all
[33:02] behind.
[33:04] Oh,
[33:07] I got to leave
[33:09] [Music]
[33:10] it. Leave it all
[33:14] [Music]
[33:16] behind. I guess that
[33:20] I should be looking
[33:23] for a better
[33:26] place to
[33:28] live. That's right. But I can't seem to
[33:34] get
[33:35] excited
[33:36] about this world and all it has to give.
[33:44] But I could care
[33:47] less. I could buy it all with a
[33:52] sit
[33:54] every
[33:56] night. Oh, what a good
[34:02] world to me with the
[34:06] rapture on my mind.
[34:12] [Music]
[34:16] All I
[34:18] got is
[34:20] leaving
[34:21] on my
[34:24] [Music]
[34:26] mind. Yes, Lord. Oh, it
[34:30] seems that's all
[34:33] I'm thinking
[34:37] about. So much of the
[34:41] time is how that
[34:44] soon and very soon I'll leave my
[34:53] troubles for behind.
[34:56] [Music]
[35:01] God
[35:02] [Music]
[35:05] leading
[35:10] leaving. That's true, Lord. Amen.
[35:13] Hallelujah. This world is far.
[35:17] [Music]
[35:28] Hallelujah.
[35:31] Amen. Amen. We're going to a better
[35:33] place. Amen. As brother Samuel comes.
[35:35] Let's sing
[35:39] this. Give me a little
[35:43] more. While living below, everywhere
[35:46] that I go, this world's full of trouble
[35:50] and pain.
[35:52] Yes, there's murder and crime. This is
[35:55] the end time when people are going
[36:00] insane. But I found a release. My heart
[36:04] is at peace since the word of the hour
[36:07] settled
[36:09] in with troubles. I'm told my anger will
[36:13] hold to Jesus again and again.
[36:18] Oh, this world is falling
[36:21] apart. I'm so glad Jesus lived down in
[36:25] my
[36:26] heart. Oh, I'll carry it away in light
[36:31] of today. As the world gets so peaceful
[36:34] and dark, though there's struggles and
[36:38] trials outside, something is
[36:42] stir. Yes, Lord. That's right. And get
[36:46] so dark and it all falls apart. Glad
[36:50] Jesus lives down. They take
[36:55] taking their praying for peace, for
[36:59] hostage release while holding God in
[37:03] their
[37:04] hand. Yes, there's moral decay. Pray
[37:08] falling away in the shape this world and
[37:12] it won't stand.
[37:14] Let it crumble and fall. Not bothered at
[37:18] all. Cuz in the
[37:20] cl I can
[37:22] hide. When it all comes undone, trusting
[37:27] in one who gives me peace down
[37:31] inside. Lord, this world is falling
[37:36] apart. My
[37:38] Jesus my
[37:40] heart. I'm carried away.
[37:44] In the light of today, as the world sold
[37:48] is moving
[37:49] wrong. Yes, there's struggles and trials
[37:53] outside. Something is stir inside
[37:59] of as the world gets so dark and
[38:04] almost
[38:06] Jesus. Help me sing now. Yes. This world
[38:10] is falling
[38:12] apart. I'm so glad Jesus lives down in
[38:16] my
[38:17] heart. Oh, I'm carried away in the light
[38:21] of the day. As the world gets this
[38:26] morning, yes, there's struggles and
[38:29] trials
[38:31] [Music]
[38:33] outside
[38:35] of Asus.
[38:39] [Music]
[38:45] and his world is so dark and all
[38:52] those. I'm glad
[38:55] Jesus found in my
[38:57] [Applause]
[38:59] [Music]
[39:01] heart.
[39:04] Amen. Where do I
[39:08] go when there's nobody else to turn to?
[39:14] Who do I talk
[39:16] [Applause]
[39:17] to when nobody wants to listen? Who do I
[39:24] [Applause]
[39:26] need? There's no
[39:29] foundation. I
[39:32] go easy. Oh, I
[39:36] go. So, I go
[39:40] to my salvation. I go through the
[39:45] [Music]
[39:51] storm
[39:53] [Music]
[39:55] by the earth all around
[39:59] me Christ.
[40:04] When I need a shelter, when I need a
[40:08] friend, I go to your eyes. Sing
[40:12] [Music]
[40:15] hallelujah. Amen. Till my
[40:19] soul is
[40:31] over. Hallelujah.
[40:34] My
[40:37] time in my soul is my
[40:41] isolation.
[40:45] I go to
[40:49] [Music]
[40:50] my
[40:55] [Music]
[41:02] song. Heat. Heat.
[41:08] [Music]
[41:15] Go to the
[41:21] rock
[41:25] sal the builders
[41:30] reject mountain stands by
[41:36] me all around me sinking sand on
[41:42] I
[41:44] got when I need a shelter. When I need a
[41:48] friend, I go to the
[41:51] rock. Well, when I need a shelter, when
[41:56] I need a friend, I go to the
[42:02] rock. Oh,

[42:10] Hallelujah.
[42:13] Amen. What a place of safety. Amen.
[42:16] Amen. A place of real security and rest.
[42:20] Amen. I since I've come into this city
[42:23] of refuge, I don't want to leave.
[42:27] Amen. It it what what has been upon my
[42:30] life has been lifted. Amen. And you know
[42:33] what happens in that city of
[42:35] refuge? Your innocency is revealed.
[42:37] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. There's a
[42:41] there's one there that's able to break
[42:42] back the seals of your life and say,
[42:45] "You never did it in the first place."
[42:49] Amen. Amen. He He He breaks it back and
[42:52] and I don't want to leave. And you know
[42:54] the thing about it is is that whoever
[42:56] came into that city of refuge, they had
[42:59] to stay there until the priest who was
[43:01] there would die. But here we are. We're
[43:05] in a place to where Hallelujah. He ever
[43:08] liveth.
[43:09] Never had beginning of days nor ending
[43:11] of life. No father, no mother. Who is
[43:14] this Melzdc?
[43:15] None other than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:18] None other than almighty God. Amen. And
[43:22] I'm glad
[43:23] that he found me.
[43:26] Oh, hallelujah.
[43:28] Isn't the Lord good? He's so precious.
[43:32] Amen. And let's just go to him in a word
[43:33] of
[43:34] prayer. Father, thank you for your mercy
[43:38] this
[43:38] morning. Lord, we thank you for this
[43:41] beautiful day you've given us.
[43:46] Lord, through every season that we come
[43:49] through here, even in the
[43:51] natural, it reminds us, Lord, that even
[43:55] in each of our lives and through our
[43:57] journey, not only in the natural, man,
[43:59] but spiritually as well, there's
[44:02] seasons of
[44:04] life. But, Father, you are so faithful
[44:08] and you are still God through every
[44:11] season. You're working everything after
[44:14] the counsel of your own will, Lord.
[44:17] Father, even as we submitting our lives
[44:20] and our hearts to you, we're not a
[44:23] perfect people. That God, you give us
[44:26] grace as we'll look to you to even learn
[44:29] from our mistakes.
[44:31] For you promised in your word, you'll
[44:33] make all things work together for the
[44:37] good to them who are the called
[44:41] according to your
[44:43] purpose. Lord, we thank you for your
[44:45] mercy. We ask that Lord Jesus once again
[44:48] here this morning, would you just come
[44:51] by our way, Lord? I pray that Lord you
[44:54] would help us that Lord as one unit that
[44:58] we would be that way this morning and be
[45:01] able just to step aside and God I pray
[45:04] you'll just speak to us in a personal
[45:06] way. Lord I just want to get myself and
[45:09] this congregation into your hands and I
[45:12] pray that God you'll take complete
[45:14] control.
[45:15] speak to our hearts, Lord. Guide, Lord,
[45:19] I pray, Father, the words that would be
[45:21] spoken, Lord. Father, may you fill my
[45:25] mouth, Lord. Yes. Direct, oh God. Lord,
[45:29] I just Lord, I only ask for one thing is
[45:33] just let me be no more than just like
[45:34] this microphone that I'm wearing. Lord,
[45:37] may you express your thoughts through,
[45:39] Lord.
[45:41] Father, we love you, Lord. May you just
[45:44] minister now to each of our needs. Thank
[45:47] you, Father, for the opportunity we've
[45:49] had to worship you, Lord. And we just
[45:52] want to continue now to worship you,
[45:54] Lord, as the word is coming forth. I
[45:57] think as a prophet would say as that
[46:00] word is coming forth and he would say
[46:03] it, oh, may we now worship him as that
[46:06] word is coming forth to to cut away, to
[46:09] discern, as it passes through our lives.
[46:12] May we worship him. Oh Lord
[46:15] God, we don't want to leave here the
[46:17] same, Lord. Amen. We ask that God that
[46:20] you'll just pass by our way in the name
[46:23] of Jesus Christ.
[46:25] Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you this
[46:28] morning. And I wonder if you'll go to
[46:30] Revelations chapter 3 with me.
[46:34] I want to
[46:36] um certainly say it's good to be here
[46:39] and good to see each and every one of
[46:45] you and
[46:50] uh it's just good to be together, isn't
[46:52] it? Yes, sir. Man, it's just a real a
[46:55] real privilege. And I believe it's a
[46:57] real foretaste of what God has prepared
[47:00] for us because when the when the change
[47:03] of the body comes, it'll be a gathering
[47:06] together. Amen. Amen. It will be a
[47:09] gathering together. The prophet tells us
[47:10] it'll be 30 to 40 days upon this earth
[47:13] getting together with the resurrected
[47:16] saints. Then we will be changed. And you
[47:19] know, you look and say, "Well, where is
[47:21] that in the scripture?" Well, Acts
[47:22] chapter 1, the Lord Jesus was there with
[47:25] them for about the period of 40 days
[47:27] upon the earth. That's right. And
[47:30] brother Bram tells us like this. He said
[47:32] the reason even of that will be, he
[47:35] said, because we will be looking around
[47:38] to see who made it. And he said then
[47:43] after that time is is is finished, he
[47:46] said how he will descend and all eyes
[47:48] will be upon him. He said, "See, he
[47:50] wants all eyes to be on him."
[47:54] So God knows what our longing will be.
[47:55] Did so and so is is this one and that
[47:57] one, but then everything will just turn.
[48:01] You know, I I can't explain how that
[48:04] it's all going to take place. And I'm
[48:06] talking about even in the aspect to
[48:09] where that we even in that moment would
[48:13] be able to even look to him and rejoice
[48:16] as we rejoice now but to
[48:19] realize I've arrived.
[48:22] Because if you if we had in our mind
[48:25] this one missed it, this one missed it
[48:27] or this missed it, it wouldn't be
[48:29] joyous.
[48:31] So you ask me, brother Samuel, how is
[48:32] that all going to work? Well, the Bible
[48:34] tells us at the the wedding the wedding
[48:36] supper, he'll wipe away the tears from
[48:39] our eyes, sir. But I I believe even
[48:41] before then, now this just brother
[48:43] Samuel, I don't I I just believe that
[48:45] God himself, the same God that can take
[48:47] a situation just like this morning and
[48:49] can show so change even our outlook on
[48:52] things. He can take sadness this morning
[48:55] and turn it to joy just like that to
[48:57] where you can't even explain what's
[48:59] happened. That's the way I believe it'll
[49:01] be. He's faithful, isn't he? Lord, he
[49:04] creates the conditions that's necessary.
[49:07] So, let's read here in the scriptures,
[49:08] Revelations 3. And I don't have I
[49:11] apologize. I don't have slides, but the
[49:13] Lord just changed some things here just
[49:15] just moments before leaving. So, uh I
[49:18] don't I just we're just going to go with
[49:19] this. In Revelations 3, and unto the
[49:23] angel of the church of the lady Oans,
[49:26] write these things saith the amen.
[49:30] That's the final word. That's the so be
[49:32] it. The faithful and true witness, the
[49:36] beginning or the author of the creation
[49:39] of God. That's none other than God
[49:41] himself.
[49:43] Now, this message is to the angel of the
[49:46] church of the lady Oas. I know thy works
[49:51] that thou art neither cold nor hot. I
[49:55] would thou work cold or hot. So then,
[49:58] because thou art lukewarm, and neither
[50:01] cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my
[50:04] mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich
[50:08] and increased with goods, and have need
[50:10] of nothing. Now, what are they doing?
[50:13] They're looking at the wrong thing for
[50:16] spiritual vindication.
[50:20] He says, "I have need of nothing and
[50:21] knowest not." So they're they're unaware
[50:24] that thou art wretched, miserable, poor,
[50:28] blind, and naked. Verse 18, I counsel
[50:32] thee to buy of me gold tried in the
[50:36] fire. Aren't you thankful that the Holy
[50:39] Spirit, he is the mighty conqueror?
[50:42] Amen. You could see it all the way down
[50:45] through the prophets when they had it
[50:46] just in where it would come upon them
[50:49] and then it would it would lift away
[50:50] because the atonement had not come to
[50:53] where Christ could dwell fully in a body
[50:57] and to think it's been tried all the way
[51:00] down and especially there in the life of
[51:04] our Lord Jesus
[51:06] Christ. He said be of good cheer for I
[51:09] have overcome. Amen. Right. And brother
[51:12] Ram takes that scripture in John 16:33
[51:15] and says what he was saying there is I
[51:18] took the Holy Ghost in my body and
[51:20] overcome by it and so shall you.
[51:25] Yes sir. Amen. It's it's the spirit of
[51:27] God that raises up that son and daughter
[51:30] of God on the inside. And it's his life
[51:32] operating through us that's overcoming.
[51:35] How many overcoming?
[51:37] Amen. Well, you got to have battles to
[51:39] overcome, right? But I counsel thee to
[51:42] buy me gold that's been tried in the
[51:44] fire. This has been proven. That's
[51:46] right. That's what David said when he
[51:47] went to battle. I do I can't wear this
[51:49] armor. I need to take with me what I
[51:52] know has been proven. And God has proven
[51:55] over and over his word. It can't fail.
[51:58] Let let me read on. I counsel thee to
[52:00] buy me gold tried in the fire that thou
[52:02] mayest be rich and white raignment that
[52:04] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[52:07] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[52:11] anoint thine eyes with Isav that thou
[52:13] mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke
[52:18] and chasen. Be zealous, therefore, and
[52:22] repent. Behold, I stand at the door and
[52:26] knock. And if any man hear my voice and
[52:29] open the door, I will come in to him and
[52:33] will s with him and he with me. To him
[52:36] that overcomemeth will I grant to sit
[52:39] with me in my throne, even as I also
[52:42] overcame, and am set down with my father
[52:45] in his throne. He that hath an ear, let
[52:47] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[52:50] churches. Amen. May God bless you and
[52:52] bless the reading of the word. As you're
[52:54] being seated, will you um turn with me
[52:58] in one more a couple more places in the
[52:59] scripture here? And um I want to go to 1
[53:03] Corinthians
[53:09] 11. 1 Corinthians
[53:16] 11 and verse
[53:20] 29. 1 Corinthians 11:29. For he that
[53:23] eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth
[53:27] and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not
[53:31] discerning the Lord's body. And for this
[53:34] cause many are weak and sickly among
[53:37] you, and many sleep. For if we would
[53:40] judge ourselves, we should not be
[53:43] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[53:46] chasened of the Lord that we should not
[53:49] be condemned with the world.
[53:53] Now when we look here even in this
[53:56] passage of scripture and I'll give you
[53:58] my title in a moment but when you look
[54:00] at this passage of
[54:02] scripture we recognize that here just a
[54:05] few weeks ago we we took the communion
[54:08] and and when doing that it's it's a
[54:11] symbol and a testament that we are
[54:14] testifying that through and by the new
[54:18] birth through and by that of where the
[54:20] Holy Spirit has come and brought brought
[54:23] a complete transformation in my life and
[54:26] I am partaking of this word. This is
[54:28] what I'm living by. I'm living by the
[54:30] word of God. There's a fellowship that I
[54:33] have. We are taking that as a symbol and
[54:35] it's a testimony. Jesus said, "Do this
[54:38] in remembrance of me." And so there's a
[54:42] testimony that that that comes with
[54:44] that. this these scriptures that that we
[54:46] read uh none of the scriptures are to be
[54:50] uh um taken in a manner uh to bring
[54:53] torment uh to bring uncertainty because
[54:57] I want to say this to you that with the
[54:59] basis of where I'm working with here
[55:01] this morning is God's desire is always
[55:04] to bring settleness is to bring rest is
[55:08] to bring certainty this is why that
[55:11] he'll move right down through his word
[55:14] and sometimes when you even uh thoughts
[55:17] and things in our mind and you know you
[55:19] you learn this as you grow in the Lord
[55:21] and and uh you have to apply it and that
[55:24] is you'll hear uh things mentioned
[55:27] through your mind and it will be clothed
[55:29] in your own voice as far as if you spoke
[55:31] out loud and recorded yourself and this
[55:34] is where that the enemy many times will
[55:36] turn around and try to cause you to
[55:38] believe that that's your own thought
[55:41] that's your own desire
[55:43] because it'll be spoken, clothed within
[55:45] your voice, within your mind. Or he
[55:48] might use some something else. Or it
[55:51] might be that of a portion of a
[55:52] scripture, a portion of a quote. And and
[55:55] um let me just say it to you like this.
[55:58] The way that you're able to discern or
[56:01] to know the difference, God himself will
[56:04] be the one that will open that to you
[56:06] and I. But I want you to understand this
[56:08] right here. Satan when he takes a hold
[56:12] of things, it's always to break
[56:14] confidence.
[56:16] It's to bring fear. The Bible said
[56:19] perfect love cast out fear because fear
[56:23] hath torment. And so the Bible also
[56:27] tells us that we have not been given the
[56:30] spirit of fear, but of power, of love,
[56:34] and of a sound mind. So the so the
[56:37] reality that of of the word is is how
[56:40] that God will come along through his
[56:42] word and you know it might be Satan is
[56:45] twisting things this way and the Holy
[56:47] Spirit will come and he'll make things
[56:49] so real and so clear to your life that
[56:53] you recognize and you can see it because
[56:57] that he alone who is the word has taken
[57:01] a hold of his own word because he is the
[57:06] interpreter of his own word. When Satan
[57:09] got a hold of that promise that God had
[57:11] given in Eden and his whole objective
[57:16] was is to to bring about that fall and
[57:20] when he took a hold of that there was an
[57:23] anointing that came with that. Are you
[57:26] with me? It was and that anointing that
[57:29] came with it was an anointing of
[57:31] unbelief. Right. That's right. It was an
[57:33] anointing that was causing her to probe
[57:36] for more of knowledge. Now, we need
[57:40] knowledge. We need understanding. But
[57:42] when knowledge has come, we that by the
[57:46] word of God, it's not a knowledge that
[57:48] leads us from the word. Nor is should it
[57:51] be a if a knowledge that puffs us up,
[57:55] but it ought to be a knowledge where we
[57:56] can see where if I'm falling short or
[58:00] it's where God wants to lead us deeper
[58:03] in in our walk with him, then the spirit
[58:06] of God who's unfolding that to us is the
[58:09] one who comes to quicken it in our lives
[58:12] and then make it alive through us. So
[58:15] it's not us living by our intellect. We
[58:18] receive the word. How does it pass
[58:20] through our mind? Right? And it is the
[58:24] word, God's thoughts that has life in
[58:27] it. And when we receive that word into
[58:30] ourselves, as the word goes down, then
[58:32] the word becomes an action in our lives.
[58:36] Now, when we read this here in the
[58:39] scripture, God's desire, as I'm coming
[58:42] back to this, is always that we in our
[58:44] life would walk and be able to walk with
[58:47] a certainty. And I don't mean a a
[58:50] something that's false or something
[58:52] that's hyped up, but I mean to wear that
[58:55] it's our life it we're we're we're not
[58:58] afraid to be thoroughly checked through
[59:00] the word.
[59:02] We we want our lives to be examined.
[59:05] I you know to me I know uh you know the
[59:08] Roman Catholic Church teaches you're
[59:10] going to you know come into purgatory
[59:12] and we'll pray you out of purgatory.
[59:14] Well, the reality is to the believer,
[59:17] you know, I don't need nobody when I've
[59:19] gone on. Right now is the real
[59:21] purgatory.
[59:23] This is where the Holy Spirit is coming
[59:25] to purge out our lives is making a
[59:29] people ready for the rapture.
[59:34] It's it's a catching away. So within
[59:37] this to think how Paul would would
[59:40] deliver this in 1 Corinthians 11, it's
[59:43] very much just like what we read out of
[59:45] Revelations 3. A condition that was
[59:49] among the church of confusion in this
[59:52] last days, but of heightened religious
[59:56] formalities. Now I'm going to tell you
[59:59] there is something more worse than a
[1:00:01] spirit of alcohol, smoking,
[1:00:04] prostitution, and everything else. The
[1:00:06] worst spirit there is is a religious
[1:00:08] spirit.
[1:00:10] Because a religious spirit, you can't
[1:00:12] tell it nothing. You can't lead it. And
[1:00:15] let me just tell you where that
[1:00:16] religious spirit comes in. The Bible
[1:00:18] tells us that when the the unclean
[1:00:21] spirit is gone out of the man. You know
[1:00:24] where I'm talking out of the book of
[1:00:25] Matthew. Brother Bram says, "Notice he
[1:00:28] wasn't cast out. He went out willfully."
[1:00:33] How did that happen? through the
[1:00:34] preaching of the word and a life
[1:00:37] beginning just to agree with the word of
[1:00:40] God. So the word remember Jesus said the
[1:00:43] word th uh uh thy word uh sanctify them
[1:00:46] through thy thy truth uh thy word father
[1:00:50] for thy word is truth. So it is the
[1:00:54] truth the preaching of the word that
[1:00:56] will actually cast out devils. It'll
[1:01:00] break the atmosphere of gloom and and
[1:01:03] confusion and amnesia. There's nothing
[1:01:06] as powerful as the word of God being
[1:01:10] delivered by God himself. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:14] And so when we when we see this in in
[1:01:17] the condition that that that that we're
[1:01:20] that we're living in, we know that the
[1:01:22] the prophet when I was talking about
[1:01:24] that religious spirit, brother Bam tells
[1:01:26] us, he says, "Notice that spirit, it
[1:01:28] goes out and it walks in dry places and
[1:01:31] then it comes back to the house and
[1:01:34] finds that this house is garnished. It's
[1:01:37] all cleaned up on the inside. Everything
[1:01:39] is nice, but it's empty." Ah, there you
[1:01:42] go.
[1:01:44] There you go. And with it, it says, "I
[1:01:47] will return back to my house, and it
[1:01:49] takes with it seven other devils."
[1:01:53] The Bible said, "So that the estate of
[1:01:56] that man is worse than the first." Is
[1:02:00] that right? We're living in an age and a
[1:02:04] time where we find sin is compiling. And
[1:02:08] the prophet will take that scripture and
[1:02:10] tie it in to the age that we're living
[1:02:13] in to where that down through seven
[1:02:16] church ages and how that unclean spirit
[1:02:19] there is walked. But here in this last
[1:02:22] time, we just read it in Revelations 3,
[1:02:25] it comes in the form of a religious
[1:02:28] spirit.
[1:02:30] That's good. And that religious spirit,
[1:02:32] it let me just tell you what religion
[1:02:35] is. The very word means a covering. All
[1:02:37] right. And this is why when the
[1:02:40] scripture said in Revelations 3, thou
[1:02:42] art naked and does don't know it because
[1:02:46] there is nothing that one man can give
[1:02:49] another man to actually clothe his soul.
[1:02:53] It there's only one garment that is can
[1:02:57] can be given that will absolutely clothe
[1:03:00] you and I as we ought to be clothed and
[1:03:03] that is the garment of the word. It is
[1:03:06] the garment of the Holy Spirit. There's
[1:03:08] only one thing that'll change your
[1:03:10] nature, and that is the spirit of the
[1:03:13] living God.
[1:03:15] Is that right? The Bible says in
[1:03:17] Revelations 19, "Let us be glad and
[1:03:19] rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has
[1:03:22] come. And his wife, the lamb's wife, no,
[1:03:25] not the lion's wife, the lamb's wife,
[1:03:28] one that is meek and a submissive heart
[1:03:30] and willing to yield to the word. She
[1:03:34] hath made herself ready. We see not
[1:03:38] waiting. Well, God, I'm just waiting on
[1:03:40] you to do this and I'm just waiting on
[1:03:42] you to do this. But it's taking God at
[1:03:44] his word. And when we see that there is
[1:03:47] a lacking, it's acting upon that word.
[1:03:50] That's why the prophet said in marriage
[1:03:52] of the lamb, "Oh, brother Brandham, if
[1:03:54] you'll only pray for me that God will
[1:03:56] deliver me of this spirit and uh this
[1:03:58] gambling, this alcohol, this this and
[1:04:00] that. If you only do that, I'll serve
[1:04:02] him." Brother Ram said, "You've got
[1:04:04] something to do." Amen.
[1:04:07] There is a fight.
[1:04:10] Are you hearing me? Let me tell you,
[1:04:12] when God got a hold of my life, a fight
[1:04:14] that I had with music.
[1:04:17] Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I would be out in
[1:04:19] the truck during lunch break. I would
[1:04:22] turn it over to the stations that I
[1:04:24] listen to out of Cleveland, sitting
[1:04:25] right out there on the bay in Sunduski.
[1:04:27] I'd turn it over. No, no, I I can't. I
[1:04:29] don't want to go that way. I had given
[1:04:31] all my music away. I had given it away.
[1:04:34] Gave my earring. Gave everything away.
[1:04:36] But here I was sitting there and I would
[1:04:38] turn it back. No, I I can't. I'm not not
[1:04:40] going back to that. And then, you know,
[1:04:42] here it was. I turn it back. Why? There
[1:04:44] was still something in there, a desire
[1:04:46] for it. But let me just say this to you.
[1:04:48] You've got to wrestle it out.
[1:04:52] And what I mean by wrestling it out,
[1:04:53] it's not your human strength. It's
[1:04:55] saying, "God, I give it to you." Amen.
[1:04:59] This is an individual affair.
[1:05:02] It's an individual walk with God. And
[1:05:04] I'm going to tell you what he did. He
[1:05:06] took it from me. It didn't just happen
[1:05:08] on one day or the next day. I don't know
[1:05:10] how many days that that that went on. Or
[1:05:12] maybe it was even weeks. But I know
[1:05:14] there came a change.
[1:05:17] What are you saying? The fight is worth
[1:05:20] it.
[1:05:22] Eternal life is a fight. Yes. The Bible
[1:05:26] said the Lord the kingdom of heaven uh
[1:05:28] the it suffereth violence and the
[1:05:31] violent take it by force.
[1:05:34] This is not an hour to be passive.
[1:05:37] It's an hour to be violent.
[1:05:41] What do you mean by violent? I'm not
[1:05:42] talking about stirring things up. I'm
[1:05:44] talking about where you need to come to
[1:05:47] a place that you get angry with the
[1:05:50] devil
[1:05:52] and don't give him any place in your
[1:05:55] life where you come to a spot like
[1:05:57] Jacob. Enough is enough is enough.
[1:06:01] I'm tired of being Jacob.
[1:06:06] Do you realize what brings you and I to
[1:06:08] that place? Do you realize what deals
[1:06:10] with our life to bring us to that place?
[1:06:13] That's what I'm speaking on this
[1:06:14] morning. The spirit of discernment.
[1:06:18] That's so good. Because we're living in
[1:06:20] an age of such blendedness.
[1:06:24] We're living in an
[1:06:26] age where
[1:06:27] sin is is celebrating.
[1:06:32] We're living in the age, the Bible tells
[1:06:33] us in the book of Isaiah, where they
[1:06:35] would celebrate, Paul picks it up in
[1:06:36] Romans, where good is called evil and
[1:06:38] evil is called good. That's right.
[1:06:41] Why is that? and spirits. It's not men
[1:06:43] in their reasoning. It's spirits.
[1:06:48] That's true. But God is faithful as he
[1:06:51] has been down through every age to send
[1:06:54] his word and the spirit of discernment
[1:06:57] has come
[1:06:59] because as we read here in this last
[1:07:01] scripture of 1 Corinthians 11, not
[1:07:04] discerning the Lord's body. Now, who is
[1:07:07] the Lord's body? What is the Lord's
[1:07:09] body? Well, the Lord's body is the word.
[1:07:14] It is him. The Bible said in 1
[1:07:18] Corinthians 12, "For by one spirit ye
[1:07:21] are baptized into one body, and that
[1:07:25] body is the word." This is why that when
[1:07:29] the scripture says, I believe in 1 John
[1:07:31] chapter 5, that there are three that
[1:07:35] bear record in heaven. The father, the
[1:07:38] word, and the holy ghost. And these
[1:07:42] three are one.
[1:07:45] Right? This is why Romans 8 said, "The
[1:07:48] spirit beareth witness with our spirit
[1:07:51] that we are the sons of God."
[1:07:54] Hallelujah. And the prophet when he was
[1:07:56] asked the question, is it possible for a
[1:07:59] person to actually know that they are a
[1:08:01] son and daughter of God? And the prophet
[1:08:03] said absolutely. And he takes us right
[1:08:05] to that scripture of Romans 8. Thy
[1:08:08] spirit beareth witness with the word.
[1:08:11] Let me tell you what that means. It
[1:08:12] means when our life there has come a
[1:08:15] change on the inside and it is a
[1:08:17] receiving of the word of God.
[1:08:22] Not just doctrines, not just teaching,
[1:08:24] but let me just put it to you plain like
[1:08:26] this. Where there's nothing that our
[1:08:28] soul in God's word could not punctuate
[1:08:32] with an amen. Amen. Even when things are
[1:08:35] brought to our knowledge that we have
[1:08:38] not known before, but when the spirit of
[1:08:42] God breaks away ignorance around our
[1:08:44] lives and we say, "Oh Lord, I I didn't
[1:08:47] realize that that you know, I knew
[1:08:48] something might have been a little
[1:08:50] wrong." But when he comes and notice as
[1:08:52] he makes himself known, what do you do?
[1:08:54] You quickly leave it. Right? Where do
[1:08:57] you leave it at? Because you might be
[1:08:58] sitting right in the house of God.
[1:09:00] quickly what it is. You dismiss it out
[1:09:02] of your heart.
[1:09:04] It's like in your home where you take
[1:09:06] down a picture and say this picture,
[1:09:08] it's no longer going to be here.
[1:09:11] It's taking where you're allowing the
[1:09:13] spirit of God to take those things out
[1:09:15] of your life. So the discerning of the
[1:09:17] Lord's body, discerning what is his
[1:09:20] body? Well, it's him. He said, "Upon
[1:09:22] this rock, I'll build my church and the
[1:09:24] gates of hell shall not prevail." So
[1:09:27] it's it's that which he himself builds
[1:09:31] his church upon the spiritual revelation
[1:09:35] of who he is.
[1:09:38] Wow. That's so good. This is his body.
[1:09:42] His body is him in action. Yes, sir. Are
[1:09:46] you with me? You want to know what he's
[1:09:49] thinking in the heavens? Look at what
[1:09:51] he's doing through the earth. Oh yes.
[1:09:54] Right. Thy will be done in earth even as
[1:09:56] it is in heaven. Brother Brandon said,
[1:09:58] "The hand moves in heaven, it'll move on
[1:10:00] earth." It's a reflection of what's
[1:10:04] going on. Right. Where did Moses catch
[1:10:07] the inspiration of the tabernacle of God
[1:10:10] that God might dwell among him? He was
[1:10:12] caught up. Yes. Right. Into heaven. He
[1:10:16] went up on the mountain. Everybody with
[1:10:17] me? Amen. And God reveals to him these
[1:10:21] things. So what happens now? what was in
[1:10:24] the heavens in the invisible realm
[1:10:27] becomes
[1:10:28] now
[1:10:30] h it captures the heart of God's people
[1:10:33] and now an assembling of what was in
[1:10:36] God's mind begins to take place
[1:10:39] so the people are not walking by their
[1:10:42] own thinking or building a building of
[1:10:45] their own establishment
[1:10:48] this is why in the book of revelations
[1:10:50] where God calls out and says they are
[1:10:53] false apostles. And he says that their
[1:10:56] assembling is not after me. It's after
[1:11:00] Satan.
[1:11:02] It doesn't mean that they don't mean
[1:11:03] that they got books of I don't know if
[1:11:05] the guy's name was Alexander Crowley or
[1:11:07] whatever he is and and devils and oh my
[1:11:10] they got this, you know, sign and that.
[1:11:11] No, no, no. The devil's a slicker.
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:16] Come on, friends. We're not talking
[1:11:18] about witchcraft. All right. Amen. We're
[1:11:21] talking about the devil who's a slicker.
[1:11:23] The one who came into the garden there
[1:11:26] more subtle.
[1:11:27] [Applause]
[1:11:29] Paul said that he was he he said he
[1:11:31] transforms himself into angels of light.
[1:11:35] In other words, bringing a greater
[1:11:37] understanding. Let me tell you
[1:11:38] something. If anything brings to you an
[1:11:41] understanding that takes you out of the
[1:11:43] word of God and away from the life of
[1:11:46] Jesus Christ, it is a lying spirit.
[1:11:53] And God permits lying spirits.
[1:11:58] He did in the time of Ahab and Micah.
[1:12:01] Elijah had already prophesied in the
[1:12:04] time of Elijah's silence.
[1:12:08] God said, "What can I what can I what
[1:12:10] can happen in order to cause Ahab to go
[1:12:12] down there that the word of Elijah might
[1:12:15] be fulfilled?"
[1:12:17] And here came up a lying spirit. Right.
[1:12:19] That's true. Amen. Son, I'll take the
[1:12:22] job.
[1:12:24] This guy was confident, man. Yes, he
[1:12:26] was. I'll go into I'll get in the mouths
[1:12:28] of their prophets
[1:12:30] and I'll speak to them a word. Oh, it
[1:12:33] had them all stirred up. You talking
[1:12:35] about emotional? Come on now. You know
[1:12:37] I'm preaching. Zedekiah grabbed the
[1:12:40] horns and running around and my
[1:12:42] goodness, they had such a time. But
[1:12:44] listen, Micah was not walking there and
[1:12:47] moved by an anointing.
[1:12:50] Are you hearing me now? He was looking
[1:12:53] at the word. And when they told him,
[1:12:55] "You got to say what the rest are
[1:12:56] saying. You got to say what the rest are
[1:12:58] saying." But God showed in the end time,
[1:13:02] not only would he have a true messenger,
[1:13:04] but God would have people in the end
[1:13:06] time. It didn't matter if your whole
[1:13:07] family's against you. It didn't matter
[1:13:09] who's against you. You're going to stand
[1:13:11] on thus saith the Lord.
[1:13:15] Come on, somebody.
[1:13:18] Amen. You might have to stand alone.
[1:13:21] Let me tell you, you'll never win your
[1:13:22] family. You'll never win anybody by
[1:13:24] being a compromiser.
[1:13:27] Come on. It's got to stand for the
[1:13:30] truth. It stand for the word of God. And
[1:13:33] you can stand for God's word with love
[1:13:35] in your heart.
[1:13:39] Come on.
[1:13:41] Well, now this this you know that lion
[1:13:43] spirit just coming along and and to lead
[1:13:46] them. What was that lion spirit doing?
[1:13:48] It led them to the slaughter.
[1:13:51] And the lion spirit that is in the mouth
[1:13:54] of false prophets. And let me just tell
[1:13:56] you, a false teacher, the prophet said,
[1:13:58] has just enough truth.
[1:14:03] The biggest lie that was ever told had
[1:14:06] 99% truth in it. Yeah. One word. One
[1:14:10] word. Missing one word and you miss the
[1:14:13] rapture. The Bible said in Revelation,
[1:14:15] "Whosoever addeth one word or taketh one
[1:14:18] word away, his part will be taken from
[1:14:21] the book of life."
[1:14:24] Is that right?
[1:14:27] And so these lying spirits, they
[1:14:29] gathered them. They rallied them. Let me
[1:14:32] tell you, under this pale horse
[1:14:35] anointing, right? It's a gathering.
[1:14:39] It's a mixture.
[1:14:43] Blending cultures. It's blending,
[1:14:45] blending, blending, blending, blend.
[1:14:47] Everything's a mixture. Mixture of
[1:14:49] religions and mixture. This look
[1:14:50] friends, you don't have to look very
[1:14:52] far. If you
[1:14:53] watched all the things that was taking
[1:14:56] place that even where the pope, look at
[1:14:58] all the dignitaries.
[1:15:00] Come on now. Look at all them, right?
[1:15:03] Look at all the things that was was
[1:15:05] going on. and and and and all this right
[1:15:07] here. And look, you look at I was
[1:15:08] telling my wife last night, I said, "You
[1:15:10] know what's incredible? Here is here is
[1:15:12] a situation where it's not even a nation
[1:15:14] or a world leader, but they regard him
[1:15:16] as that."
[1:15:18] That's good. That's so good. You know
[1:15:20] why? That's the spirit
[1:15:23] that was spoken in the word of God.
[1:15:27] Are you hearing me? Amen. All of that,
[1:15:29] it has it has to come under that. But
[1:15:32] let me just say this. in the midst of
[1:15:34] this hour, you and I friends, you know
[1:15:36] why? You know why people are there? You
[1:15:37] know why people are caught up? Do you
[1:15:39] realize why even those as they went you
[1:15:41] know and let me just let me let me say
[1:15:43] something here and I don't want you to
[1:15:44] get me wrong. What all that that even
[1:15:48] when Franklin Graham said that oh my
[1:15:50] after the White House prayer breakfast
[1:15:51] and Easter thing, oh my, there's going
[1:15:54] to be such a man such a revival. Now let
[1:15:56] me just say this to you. We know that's
[1:15:58] not true. Now let me just say this. I
[1:16:01] would rather have seen that there than
[1:16:04] seen that
[1:16:07] LGBTQYZ stuff and Biden putting that on
[1:16:11] Easter.
[1:16:13] Preach with me, somebody.
[1:16:15] I'm not elevating Trump or nobody else.
[1:16:18] But I am trying to show show you and I
[1:16:20] we can see that. Thank God for the
[1:16:22] spirit of discernment that we're not
[1:16:24] looking for a revival to come to
[1:16:27] America.
[1:16:29] And you know what? We're going to live
[1:16:31] in the presence of Jesus Christ until
[1:16:34] the change of our bodies.
[1:16:38] And until he comes, I don't mind paying
[1:16:40] a little bit less taxes.
[1:16:48] Say that wasn't very spiritual. No, but
[1:16:50] it is also the Bible said you don't know
[1:16:52] how to use your money.
[1:16:58] Now, don't worry. I you know I'm not I'm
[1:17:00] not going anywhere with this. You you'll
[1:17:02] find one thing about brother Samuel. I'm
[1:17:04] not here to try to put things together
[1:17:05] and pound this together and pound that
[1:17:07] together cuz the prophet of God never
[1:17:09] did that. He never gave us a word and
[1:17:12] said, "Well, this is going to happen.
[1:17:13] This is going to happen and here we are.
[1:17:14] We've seen that. We've seen predictions
[1:17:16] made. We've seen all that." And that's a
[1:17:18] trap of the devil.
[1:17:21] We are not called to make predictions.
[1:17:24] We are called when we see these things
[1:17:26] going on, lift up your head. Your
[1:17:28] redemption draweth nigh. And let me tell
[1:17:31] you, it isn't up to you or I to try to
[1:17:34] make sense out of modern events. They
[1:17:37] are made clear
[1:17:39] by prophecy.
[1:17:41] Hallelujah. That's so true. And not by
[1:17:44] trying to shuffle a quote here and
[1:17:46] shuffle this here and shuffle this here.
[1:17:48] I want a picture to look like a picture.
[1:17:51] And I don't want to have to wear your
[1:17:53] glasses to look at it.
[1:17:55] There you go. That's right. That was
[1:17:57] free.
[1:17:59] Amen. Cuz I know in Acts of the Holy
[1:18:01] Spirit, the prophet talks about a pope
[1:18:03] coming out of America. We'll see,
[1:18:06] right? I'm not doubting it. I'm just
[1:18:09] what I'm trying to tell you is you know
[1:18:10] what? It's like with everything else. I
[1:18:12] you you know what I'm resting on? I'm
[1:18:14] resting on the rapture.
[1:18:17] I'm not resting on my interpretation.
[1:18:19] I'm resting in the word and what he's
[1:18:21] doing in my life. Amen. That's where my
[1:18:24] joy is at. Cuz you know why the Bible,
[1:18:26] oh my, the prophet tells us, he said the
[1:18:28] same God that gave Polycarp and the rest
[1:18:31] of them what they needed in the hour
[1:18:33] they were standing in, he said that same
[1:18:35] God will give the supreme grace for the
[1:18:38] supreme hour.
[1:18:41] Don't worry about rapturing faith. It'll
[1:18:43] be there.
[1:18:46] Hallelujah. Don't worry about it. It'll
[1:18:49] be there. Don't worry about the ram,
[1:18:51] Abraham. It'll be there. Hallelujah.
[1:18:55] Just keep walking with him. You've got a
[1:18:58] clear vision.
[1:18:59] You've been called out of the valley
[1:19:02] into the higher heights. You've been
[1:19:04] called to Mount Mariah. You've been
[1:19:06] called to ascend.
[1:19:09] [Applause]
[1:19:14] Matthew
[1:19:15] 16 and verse one.
[1:19:20] The Pharisees and the Sadducees came and
[1:19:23] tempting desired him that he would show
[1:19:25] them a sign from
[1:19:26] heaven. You see, they they weren't
[1:19:29] convinced. And yet in all their backroom
[1:19:32] conclave type
[1:19:34] things, all their smoke signals, they
[1:19:38] knew. Nicodemus exposed them. Nicodemus
[1:19:41] exposed them. We all know you're a man
[1:19:44] come from God.
[1:19:48] You know what stumbled him?
[1:19:50] the man part.
[1:19:53] You know what has always stumbled
[1:19:54] people? The man part. But God has never
[1:19:58] done anything outside of the agency of
[1:20:01] man.
[1:20:04] That is so good. Is that right? Amen.
[1:20:07] Because in order to redeem us, he had to
[1:20:09] become a man, a son of man, right? He
[1:20:14] had to come down and that blood cell
[1:20:17] that would actually pay the price for
[1:20:20] our sin because there was no other blood
[1:20:23] that was innocent.
[1:20:26] Are you hearing me? This blood was the
[1:20:29] was was not created of of a sexual
[1:20:33] mixture. It was the creative blood of
[1:20:36] God.
[1:20:38] God had provided what would be able to
[1:20:41] take care of the sin question.
[1:20:43] God had provided what would be able to
[1:20:46] put away our sins. That his life might
[1:20:50] come to you and I and make known to you.
[1:20:53] You're free. I paid the price for you.
[1:20:56] You are always my son and my daughter.
[1:20:59] And the spirit of God comes to your life
[1:21:01] and makes you aware as a son and
[1:21:03] daughter of God what rightfully belongs
[1:21:05] to you.
[1:21:08] Praise God. Preacher. Yes, sir. He
[1:21:11] answered them and said, "When it is
[1:21:13] evening, you'll say it'll be fair
[1:21:15] weather, for the sky is red, and in the
[1:21:17] morning it'll be foul weather today, for
[1:21:19] the sky is red and lowering." Oh, you
[1:21:22] hypocrites. You can discern the face of
[1:21:24] the sky, but you cannot discern the
[1:21:27] signs of the times. A wicked and
[1:21:30] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[1:21:33] sign, and there shall no sign be given
[1:21:35] unto them, but the sign of the prophet
[1:21:38] Jonas, Jonah, and he left them and
[1:21:41] departed. What was that sign of the
[1:21:44] prophet Jonah? Resurrection.
[1:21:47] God sent Jonah. Oh my.
[1:21:51] Come on now. God sent Jonah to a place
[1:21:54] he didn't even want to go to.
[1:21:57] As a matter of fact, brother Brian, that
[1:21:59] place was so wicked, nine of them.
[1:22:01] Brother Brandham picks it up in a man
[1:22:02] running from the presence of God. He
[1:22:04] said, "The reason that
[1:22:06] Jonah was did what he did is because he
[1:22:09] thought they'll not receive this
[1:22:11] message."
[1:22:13] His thinking caused him to take a
[1:22:16] different ship.
[1:22:19] Are you hearing me? But let me just tell
[1:22:20] you, he was right in the plan of God.
[1:22:26] Because God provided a special fish.
[1:22:29] Remember brother Brown talking out there
[1:22:30] and he's between meetings and here this
[1:22:32] science fair is going on and here this
[1:22:34] they're displaying a well or you know I
[1:22:36] don't know if it there's you know an
[1:22:37] actual display or what it was but they
[1:22:39] were trying to show and disprove of how
[1:22:41] that you know well there's no way that
[1:22:43] Jonah could have been swallowed up. Let
[1:22:44] me tell you what science science let me
[1:22:47] just say this now science can can be
[1:22:50] used to prove God's word is true.
[1:22:54] But when when when it comes under the
[1:22:56] wrong inspiration, it wants to disprove.
[1:22:59] You know why? Because if you can
[1:23:01] disprove God's word, it that's what
[1:23:04] Satan wants to do to try to drive away
[1:23:07] an accountability of the hour. He wants
[1:23:10] to drive that away from you and bring
[1:23:12] that it's all right. God don't care. God
[1:23:14] loves you anyhow. God, what's he trying
[1:23:16] to do? Discredit the word of God.
[1:23:19] Because the with the objective is that
[1:23:22] he wants to separate you from what God
[1:23:24] intended for you to have. And that is a
[1:23:27] true new birth.
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:32] Are you hearing me? That's why this is
[1:23:34] why this is why the trinity doctrine it
[1:23:36] is there to try to separate the reality.
[1:23:40] Great is the mystery of godliness that
[1:23:43] God became one of us.
[1:23:47] God the whole way that now his life
[1:23:50] might come back in you and I.
[1:23:54] And they were there that that well. Oh,
[1:23:56] it can't be swallowed. It can't man
[1:23:58] can't do this. And brother Brandham just
[1:23:59] picks up. Watch this. What's wisdom?
[1:24:03] So, wait a minute. The Bible said it was
[1:24:07] a special fish the Lord had prepared.
[1:24:12] Let me just say this to you. We are no
[1:24:15] different here than any other humanity.
[1:24:20] But God has
[1:24:21] prepared a people in this hour. He
[1:24:25] already knew the bed of time that you
[1:24:27] would be planted in. Hallelujah. And he
[1:24:30] has prepared your womb, the seed to
[1:24:34] receive that seed of himself. Amen. Glor
[1:24:42] Abraham's seed came in a harlot. It
[1:24:44] produced a wild man. A man that can
[1:24:47] never be tamed. But when Abraham's seed
[1:24:51] came to the right bedding ground, it
[1:24:53] brought forth a promised son of God.
[1:24:57] Hallelujah.
[1:24:59] The Holy Spirit falling just upon your
[1:25:02] spirit, it can produce a wild man never
[1:25:05] able to be subject to the word of God.
[1:25:08] But if it ever gets to that inside man,
[1:25:12] it'll produce a son and daughter of God.
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:18] Hallelujah. It'll produce one whom some
[1:25:21] who others said there's no way possible
[1:25:24] that it can come forth. You're
[1:25:26] everything's dead. But God specializes
[1:25:29] in raising the dead to life.
[1:25:35] Hallelujah. You're not the son of a bond
[1:25:37] woman.
[1:25:40] You say, "What is the bond woman?" A
[1:25:42] denomination.
[1:25:46] And unclean,
[1:25:48] but you're the son. Come on. I'm quoting
[1:25:50] the scriptures. Galatians. You're the
[1:25:52] son of a free woman. This word is not
[1:25:56] manhandled. This word, what has brought
[1:25:58] a birth in your life has not been a
[1:26:01] man-made system.
[1:26:04] Because when that happens, you'll look
[1:26:06] like the man who's preaching. Your life
[1:26:08] will match their doctrine instead of the
[1:26:10] word. That's why God allows all the
[1:26:13] isms.
[1:26:15] All the little trickling things that
[1:26:17] have come around the message to pass
[1:26:19] away. How can it pass away? Cuz it's not
[1:26:23] the genuine life of the word. Amen.
[1:26:33] But can't discern the sign of the times.
[1:26:35] Amen. What was the sign of the
[1:26:37] times? God dwelling in flesh.
[1:26:44] You know what? God dwelling in flesh. It
[1:26:46] was the
[1:26:47] announcement. The acceptable year is
[1:26:49] upon us.
[1:26:52] That's when he took the book. It was in
[1:26:55] the hands of the priest. The priest had
[1:26:57] always had it. The priest had always,
[1:26:59] you know, they had read from it. But
[1:27:01] when he took it and he said, "The spirit
[1:27:04] of the Lord is upon me."
[1:27:07] The lamb has got the book in his hand.
[1:27:10] And he's beginning to reveal these
[1:27:12] things. Hallelujah. Amen. He begins to
[1:27:16] speak. He hath sent me. He didn't send a
[1:27:19] doctrine. He sent me the person. Amen.
[1:27:22] Right. To bang up the brokenhearted.
[1:27:24] Amen. Hallelujah. To heal the sick.
[1:27:29] To mend those, to minister to those that
[1:27:31] were bruised and give recovering of
[1:27:33] sight to the blind. You say, "Who did
[1:27:35] that?" The Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Who
[1:27:39] is it that's in our midst? It's him.
[1:27:41] Amen. Let me say this. Maybe even for
[1:27:44] you that are kind of around the fringes,
[1:27:46] you enjoy you enjoy coming here in the
[1:27:48] presence of God. But let me just let me
[1:27:50] just say this to you. the presence that
[1:27:52] you feel and what makes you desire and
[1:27:55] delight and even set aside your work
[1:27:57] schedule to be in the house of God. It's
[1:27:59] because that God himself wants to make
[1:28:03] this atmosphere more than just something
[1:28:06] that's at 15:30 Lake Breeze Road. He
[1:28:09] wants this atmosphere of his life to
[1:28:12] come live inside of you.
[1:28:15] Hallelujah. And if this atmosphere, as
[1:28:18] the children of God come in this
[1:28:19] atmosphere and the joy of the Lord
[1:28:21] begins to strike and hearts are just
[1:28:23] being tuned in with God, if that'll do
[1:28:26] that here, it'll do the same thing in
[1:28:28] your life in a personal level. It'll
[1:28:30] bring a joy in your life that the world
[1:28:32] never gave and the world can't take it
[1:28:35] away.
[1:28:36] We must discern the times.
[1:28:40] Amen. Discern the sign. I am. It's an
[1:28:44] everlasting sign. Amen. It's a super
[1:28:47] sign. It's an end time seed sign. Amen.
[1:28:51] What is it? It's Christ tabernacling in
[1:28:55] his body.
[1:28:57] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now, the
[1:29:01] Bible tells us in Zechariah
[1:29:03] 14:6, "It shall come to pass in that day
[1:29:07] that the light shall not be clear nor
[1:29:11] dark." Yeah.
[1:29:14] Just mixture just what it is. Brother
[1:29:17] Bram says just enough light at that time
[1:29:19] just to kind of
[1:29:21] see savior, right?
[1:29:25] Enough light to join a church.
[1:29:28] That that that's the kind of light it's
[1:29:30] like walking in a dark place and all of
[1:29:32] a sudden you catch a little bit of light
[1:29:34] and a little bit of light shines this
[1:29:35] thing on on a building where you can get
[1:29:37] into safety. Right? Yeah. But what you
[1:29:40] realize is is just coming to a church is
[1:29:43] not a place of safety. That's right.
[1:29:46] If the word is going forth, the spirit
[1:29:48] of God is there to make that word live,
[1:29:50] then that's one of the wonderful places
[1:29:52] that you can be because right there is
[1:29:54] God himself, the author of the creation
[1:29:57] of God that's able to bring an absolute
[1:30:00] transformation in your life. So, you're
[1:30:02] in the right place to be molded into a
[1:30:05] son and daughter of God. But you don't
[1:30:07] just want to stop at a church because
[1:30:10] there was there in the parable one that
[1:30:12] showed up at the wedding feast and
[1:30:13] didn't have on a wedding garment. That's
[1:30:15] right. And when Jesus spoke to him, he
[1:30:17] said, "Friend," Brother Ram said he
[1:30:19] called him friend because he was a
[1:30:20] church member. He had acquaintances with
[1:30:22] this man. That's so good. This this this
[1:30:25] man, you know, how'd you get in here?
[1:30:28] Well, he he knew you came in some other
[1:30:30] way. Cuz if you'd come in by the door,
[1:30:32] who is the door? Jesus said, "I'm the
[1:30:34] door to the sheep bowl." Amen. Right.
[1:30:38] And anybody who comes any other way is a
[1:30:40] thief or robber. Right now, that man
[1:30:42] didn't realize he had been robbed.
[1:30:46] He had been led by a lying spirit.
[1:30:50] To tell him just hold off. It's all
[1:30:53] right.
[1:30:54] You're a good guy. You're a good maybe a
[1:30:56] good girl. You're a good one, man.
[1:30:58] You're so wonderful. I mean, everything
[1:31:00] teas are dotted. You are an excellent
[1:31:03] upstanding community member. Can't even
[1:31:05] put a finger on your
[1:31:07] life. But no matter all your works,
[1:31:10] that's right. It'll never substitute No,
[1:31:12] it won't. For the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:14] Ghost,
[1:31:17] there was
[1:31:18] one who the Lord Jesus when he stood in
[1:31:22] his presence, the rich young ruler,
[1:31:25] and he asked him, "What must I do to
[1:31:27] have eternal life?" He knew he was
[1:31:29] lacking something in his life.
[1:31:33] Don't you appreciate the spirit of
[1:31:34] discernment that would even alert you
[1:31:37] and I to a lacking.
[1:31:40] Father God, I'm so thank God for that.
[1:31:44] Amen. Because let me tell you, brother
[1:31:46] Brandon said, "It ain't going to be the
[1:31:48] drunkard who's disappointed at the
[1:31:49] judgment. It ain't going to be the
[1:31:51] prostitute. Ain't going to He said
[1:31:52] because they already know where they're
[1:31:54] going." But he said, "What's going to be
[1:31:55] the greatest disappointment at the
[1:31:57] judgment is that man that thought he was
[1:32:00] right
[1:32:03] dwelling in church." And let me bring it
[1:32:05] on down, friends, right here around the
[1:32:08] greatest truth of this hour. You will
[1:32:11] never get any more truth than the person
[1:32:14] of truth himself in this hour, Jesus
[1:32:17] Christ. That's what this message is.
[1:32:20] This message is not a collection of
[1:32:23] doctrines. This message is the person of
[1:32:26] Jesus Christ.
[1:32:28] It's the spirit of truth, the spirit of
[1:32:31] discernment that is sent to the church
[1:32:34] of the living God to break back the
[1:32:36] clouds. Gallelujah.
[1:32:42] But it shall be one day, verse seven,
[1:32:44] which shall be known to the Lord, not
[1:32:46] day nor night, but it shall come to pass
[1:32:50] that at the evening time, it shall be
[1:32:53] light.
[1:32:55] Hallelujah. The spirit of discernment,
[1:32:58] this is why when you see it, look, look,
[1:33:01] look with churches. And I'm not here
[1:33:03] picking on churches, but I'm here
[1:33:04] preaching the word. Amen. And you know,
[1:33:07] let me tell you, the only true source of
[1:33:09] discernment, as we looked at on Thursday
[1:33:11] night, is the word of God. Hebrews 4:12.
[1:33:15] And it is not the word of God through a
[1:33:17] man's filter. Right? Amen. But it's the
[1:33:20] word of God that is through the filter
[1:33:22] of God's word. Because coming through
[1:33:24] the filter of God's word, it it'll
[1:33:27] produce a holy man's taste.
[1:33:31] It'll take away guilt. It'll take away
[1:33:32] desires. It'll cleans up our life. And
[1:33:34] you know what? on the other side here.
[1:33:36] You've got what you have is is a is a
[1:33:38] holy man. You have a daughter of God.
[1:33:40] What are they doing? The only thing they
[1:33:42] live for to draw from is the source of
[1:33:45] life.
[1:33:47] That is so true. That is so true. And
[1:33:49] only the word can bring discernment.
[1:33:51] Amen. As I said earlier, it's amazing
[1:33:55] how Satan, remember all these quotes I
[1:33:57] read a few weeks ago where where where
[1:33:59] you find different ones, brother, I'm
[1:34:00] dealing with nervousness and sometimes
[1:34:02] those coming into the time of life and
[1:34:03] oh, Satan's told you cross the line.
[1:34:05] Satan told you this and and it's got you
[1:34:07] all tore up. He said you never crossed
[1:34:08] the line, right? Yeah. Come on now.
[1:34:13] The Holy Ghost is for you. Right? Or had
[1:34:16] some that were so they they you know in
[1:34:18] in their mind even like Sister Bruce
[1:34:20] here she was in a condition and where
[1:34:22] she was at. What happened there? The
[1:34:24] spirit of discernment separated truth
[1:34:27] from error.
[1:34:30] What did it bring? Stability in her
[1:34:32] life.
[1:34:33] You see this is why it's so much power
[1:34:36] such power in the in the word of God the
[1:34:39] message of the hour. Because you're not
[1:34:40] coming before a man. No. It's not a man
[1:34:43] telling you things. It is Melzdc that's
[1:34:46] in our midst. And when we talk about
[1:34:48] Melzdc, Hebrews 7, he never had no
[1:34:50] beginning of days nor ending of life,
[1:34:52] neither father nor mother. Who could
[1:34:54] that be but God himself?
[1:34:57] Is that right? That's why the prophet
[1:34:59] said after that time in the Old
[1:35:01] Testament, he said we never hear no more
[1:35:03] of him because he became Jesus Christ.
[1:35:06] God became flesh. Amen. Amen. That's why
[1:35:11] we don't believe in eternal sunship
[1:35:13] because the body had to die.
[1:35:16] But the spirit of life, that quickening
[1:35:19] power raised it up.
[1:35:26] And after it's all said and
[1:35:28] done, after the ruling part is over and
[1:35:31] after the millennium is over, he said,
[1:35:33] "Then shall he have delivered the the
[1:35:35] the kingdom to the father." You say,
[1:35:37] "What's going to take place? Is Jesus
[1:35:38] going to come down? No. Oh, but it'll
[1:35:41] break forth even in a greater reality
[1:35:43] that it's been me the whole time.
[1:35:45] Almighty God, in that time, Paul said in
[1:35:48] Timothy, shall he reveal who is the only
[1:35:51] wise and potentate?
[1:35:53] [Applause]
[1:35:55] The only wise and true immortal God.
[1:35:58] Brother and sister, we have not have a
[1:36:00] secondhanded revelation. This is a visit
[1:36:04] by the death of the Holy Spirit himself.
[1:36:10] It's discerning who's in our midst. This
[1:36:13] is the time
[1:36:16] to be yolked to the word of God.
[1:36:19] Amen.
[1:36:21] That is so good.
[1:36:24] Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:26] spirit of discernment in these last days
[1:36:29] calling out against the cursed
[1:36:33] things. The same spirit of discernment,
[1:36:36] notice, brother Ram said, the same one
[1:36:37] who does it on the platform, that same
[1:36:39] spirit of discernment looks out through
[1:36:40] these eyes and he sees the condition of
[1:36:43] time.
[1:36:45] He sees the churches and they just
[1:36:48] letting everybody do everything
[1:36:51] and everything falls under the canopy as
[1:36:53] well, God loves you.
[1:36:56] Well, if that's what you call love, that
[1:36:59] he would let me live in sin
[1:37:04] and he would let me dwell and live with
[1:37:07] desires in my life and live a life that
[1:37:12] has no victory.
[1:37:15] I don't call that love.
[1:37:18] No sir. Then we need to understand what
[1:37:21] is real love.
[1:37:23] Now this is the age of self love.
[1:37:27] Everything now the gospel has been
[1:37:29] tailored as it was in the fall of the
[1:37:34] church in the thyron age. Little by
[1:37:37] little that innocent white white horse
[1:37:39] rider begin to ride coming into that
[1:37:42] first age. Then it moves over to the red
[1:37:44] horse rider begins to gain power. That's
[1:37:46] right. See innocent things become
[1:37:48] powerful in your life. That's right.
[1:37:50] Amen. Do you realize the very thing that
[1:37:52] Saul failed to destroy the Amalachites,
[1:37:56] the very thing that ended his life was a
[1:37:58] young one. That's right.
[1:38:01] That's good.
[1:38:03] That's why the prophet said, "Don't
[1:38:05] spare the baby Amalachites cuz they grow
[1:38:07] up to be big ones."
[1:38:09] The very thing that he failed to put out
[1:38:12] of his life is the very thing that
[1:38:14] consumed him. That's right. Amen. You
[1:38:17] see, in this hour we're living
[1:38:20] in, we're living in a time, like I read
[1:38:23] in Zechariah 14, for as far as the world
[1:38:27] and way things are, it's a gray time.
[1:38:31] It's a grayish time. I don't like gray
[1:38:33] skies. That's I was glad when I I was a
[1:38:35] little bit apprehensive about going to
[1:38:36] Edmonton because last time I went to
[1:38:37] Edmonton, everything was gray. I left
[1:38:40] out here in September. I was I had more
[1:38:42] months of sunlight.
[1:38:45] The last time I went up there, it was
[1:38:46] gray. Oh, but it was sunny this time and
[1:38:49] beautiful. I thank God every day,
[1:38:50] believe
[1:38:51] me. But you know, when the gray and the
[1:38:54] condition and all of those things the
[1:38:56] way that it is, it's a mixture,
[1:38:58] right? It's a time there of uh of of of
[1:39:02] the uncertainty. But God has made it
[1:39:05] clear within this hour that he would
[1:39:08] bring to us in this time a real true
[1:39:12] light. Because let me just say this to
[1:39:13] you. For the most part, it's not the
[1:39:16] black and white that get us.
[1:39:19] Are you hearing me? So good. It ain't
[1:39:21] the black and white. It's the gray
[1:39:23] areas.
[1:39:28] If you've got problems with the black
[1:39:30] and white, then what you have problems
[1:39:32] with is where your relationship is with
[1:39:34] God.
[1:39:36] All right? That's right. If if it's
[1:39:38] reasoning you out to things of the word
[1:39:40] of God, then that that's let me just
[1:39:41] tell you, listen listen friends, it's a
[1:39:43] reality in this in this day and age, I
[1:39:45] am holding on for each and every person
[1:39:48] that they would each and every one would
[1:39:50] be so on fire and filled with the Holy
[1:39:52] Ghost. And being on fire and full with
[1:39:53] the Holy Ghost don't mean that you're
[1:39:55] doing cartwheels and everything else. It
[1:39:57] means you've got a ferveny for God.
[1:40:02] And you care about what God thinks. Not
[1:40:05] about what your boss thinks. Not about
[1:40:07] what your neighbor thinks. Not about
[1:40:10] what somebody else thinks. You care
[1:40:12] about what God thinks.
[1:40:16] Hallelujah. And I'll tell you, you stand
[1:40:18] there on that day, it won't matter
[1:40:19] anybody else is there. That's right.
[1:40:22] That's why today is the day of
[1:40:24] salvation. Amen. But this in this this
[1:40:28] day, it's the gray things. This is why
[1:40:30] the things that even in our life, this
[1:40:33] is why the spirit of God, as we're
[1:40:35] feeding on the word and giving ourselves
[1:40:37] to the word, the Holy Spirit will come,
[1:40:39] we can witness of this. And he will
[1:40:41] alert us to things and say, "Uh-uh.
[1:40:45] Uh-uh. That's right. Uhuh." And you just
[1:40:46] can't put your finger on it. And he just
[1:40:48] said, "Uh-uh. Uh-uh. That's so true."
[1:40:51] Now, you got a choice. You can look
[1:40:53] around and say, "Well, so and so does
[1:40:56] it." But you better be careful because
[1:40:59] you might follow so and so right out of
[1:41:01] the rapture.
[1:41:03] That's right. God never called you to
[1:41:05] follow a man. Paul said, "Follow me as I
[1:41:09] follow Christ." So what are you
[1:41:11] following is the word. That's why the
[1:41:13] prophet said, "And come follow me." He
[1:41:15] said, "You want to make sure who that
[1:41:17] man you're following, see who he's
[1:41:20] following."
[1:41:21] And let me tell you something that this
[1:41:23] church of the last days, the prophet
[1:41:26] seen it in a vision sitting right
[1:41:28] outside of that JC. C Penneyy's
[1:41:29] department store. I sat right in the
[1:41:31] parking lot where that vision came. It
[1:41:33] ain't some fabulous super duper place,
[1:41:35] but God visited him in a vision. And he
[1:41:38] stood and preached the masterpiece and
[1:41:40] didn't know what the interpretation was
[1:41:43] until he was preaching it. Hallelujah.
[1:41:46] You know what that shows me? that while
[1:41:48] this word is being preached, there is a
[1:41:51] people that can see themselves in line
[1:41:54] with God's word. And it also shows me
[1:41:57] that while the word is being preached,
[1:41:59] that for the elect that maybe you get
[1:42:02] your eyes off here and you start
[1:42:04] wondering over here, that same word will
[1:42:06] say get back in step.
[1:42:10] What is it? God watching over his
[1:42:14] word. Amen. The spirit of discernment.
[1:42:18] Amen.
[1:42:21] Amen. Because that church of America was
[1:42:24] following a witch. That's right.
[1:42:27] You know what a witch is? It's
[1:42:29] sorceries.
[1:42:32] This is why Paul came amongst the
[1:42:33] Galatians and said, "Oh foolish
[1:42:35] Galatians, who have bewitched you, that
[1:42:38] you should not obey the truth." Right?
[1:42:40] Right. Let me tell you, anything that's
[1:42:43] holding you back from complete obedience
[1:42:45] to the truth is a bewitching spirit.
[1:42:49] It's called a seducing spirit. Or as the
[1:42:51] prophet preached it, an enticing spirit.
[1:42:54] Amen. An enticing spirits, the prophet
[1:42:57] said, it'll lead people instead of them
[1:43:00] submitting to the real word of God,
[1:43:02] they'll go on fast for 40 days. They'll
[1:43:06] speak with tongues. They'll do this.
[1:43:08] They'll do that. religious, right? But
[1:43:11] it's an enticing spirit to do what? Lead
[1:43:15] them from the truth of the word of God.
[1:43:18] What is the truth of the word of God?
[1:43:21] Christ in you.
[1:43:25] And Satan will use smoke screens. He'll
[1:43:27] use distractions. Why? He's wanting to
[1:43:31] lead it away from the real truth.
[1:43:36] Are you hearing me? This is why we do
[1:43:38] not base our life upon sensations. We
[1:43:41] don't base our experience upon gifts.
[1:43:44] Amen. Come on friends. We base it on the
[1:43:48] word of God. Amen.
[1:43:51] Is that right? Is our heart in
[1:43:53] subjection to the word of God? So now we
[1:43:55] find two different things. We find a
[1:43:57] spiritual birth. One church of a
[1:43:59] spiritual birth and the other of an
[1:44:01] intellectual membership. One is based on
[1:44:03] spiritual discernment and another on
[1:44:06] education and intellectual conception.
[1:44:10] Right? Now notice the Bible tells us
[1:44:12] here in Isaiah
[1:44:14] 28:5 and Isaiah 28:5, "In that day shall
[1:44:18] the Lord of hosts be for a crown of
[1:44:21] glory." Oh, I love that. He is the
[1:44:24] vindication of your life as a son and
[1:44:27] daughter of God. Are you hearing me? And
[1:44:30] for a diadem of beauty. What what's more
[1:44:32] beautiful than the character of Christ?
[1:44:35] That's the beauty of the church, right?
[1:44:37] Unto the residue of the people, and for
[1:44:40] a spirit of judgment to them that siteth
[1:44:43] in judgment, and for strength to them
[1:44:46] that turn the battle to the gate. Let me
[1:44:49] tell you, there's no greater place to
[1:44:51] bring your enemy than to the gate.
[1:44:54] It was the gate that Boaz traveled to.
[1:44:58] And he settled the disputes.
[1:45:02] Right? Where where the one who was a
[1:45:04] nearer kinsman and the prophet tells us
[1:45:06] that nearer kinsman was a devil.
[1:45:10] Our soul, our nature was kin to him.
[1:45:14] But he said, "I can't do it." You know,
[1:45:16] I'm quoting scripture. I can't do it
[1:45:18] less I mar my inheritance. If the devil
[1:45:20] would become a devil to take away the
[1:45:22] devil, it wouldn't mar his experience.
[1:45:26] But God himself became one of us. He who
[1:45:30] knew no sin became sin that we might be
[1:45:34] made the very righteousness of God in
[1:45:37] Christ. He went to the gate.
[1:45:42] And he said it won't mar my experience.
[1:45:45] These lives like this where nobody else
[1:45:48] wants them. Listen friends, let's just
[1:45:49] be honest. Our life was in a fix. The
[1:45:52] devil didn't even want us. Our lives
[1:45:55] were so messed up, he tore our picture
[1:45:57] off of his refrigerator in hell. He
[1:45:59] said, "Good Lord, I don't even want them
[1:46:01] down here." But God said, "I'll take
[1:46:04] them."
[1:46:08] Their pictures always been on my
[1:46:10] refrigerator. It's always been in my
[1:46:12] album. This is why I came. They were on
[1:46:15] my mind the whole time. This is why I
[1:46:18] came.
[1:46:20] And let me tell you something. You're
[1:46:22] more than a picture. You're a living,
[1:46:25] manifested, eternal, expressed attribute
[1:46:28] of
[1:46:30] God. You're no longer a word in a page.
[1:46:35] You're an expressed son and daughter of
[1:46:38] God that came from the loins of God's
[1:46:40] mind in the loins of Jesus and now are
[1:46:44] expressed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:51] But this is how they aired. The Bible
[1:46:53] said they aired in verse seven through
[1:46:56] wine and through strong drink or are out
[1:46:59] of the way. That's good. Yes, sir. You
[1:47:02] know what it does? Gets them all loose.
[1:47:06] Take somebody that's all uptight and you
[1:47:07] get them you get them start drinking.
[1:47:09] You get people that could be a stick in
[1:47:10] the mud.
[1:47:13] Come on friends. know I I know some of
[1:47:14] us we all come from different
[1:47:15] backgrounds and things but don't you
[1:47:17] know what I'm talking about you even
[1:47:19] maybe if whether you not you ever were
[1:47:21] uh had you know fell under that or not
[1:47:23] you know you've been around people I've
[1:47:25] had people call me on the phone and I
[1:47:27] knew they were drunk I'm talking been
[1:47:30] associated with a message and had called
[1:47:33] me that's good I'll tell you what
[1:47:35] happened one time to an individual they
[1:47:37] were high from smoking pot
[1:47:40] and they were they they they called me
[1:47:42] and said, "Brother Samuel, I don't know
[1:47:44] what happened and how this I said,"Well,
[1:47:46] let's pray right now and we're going to
[1:47:48] ask the Holy Spirit because your desire
[1:47:51] is to be free and and this is you
[1:47:54] stumbled into this and we're going to
[1:47:55] pray and I'm going to ask the Holy
[1:47:57] Spirit to break that over your life
[1:48:00] right now so you can get home."
[1:48:02] Hallelujah. Let me tell you what the
[1:48:04] Holy Spirit did. The Holy Spirit broke
[1:48:07] that buzz or whatever you want to call
[1:48:09] it. Hallelujah.
[1:48:11] That's so good. Now, it's a witness to
[1:48:14] her. She's not serving the Lord here
[1:48:16] right now, but it's a witness to her she
[1:48:17] can never get away from. She may not be
[1:48:20] sitting here right now, but you know
[1:48:21] what? God hadn't forgotten.
[1:48:24] You say, "Brother Samuel, what are you
[1:48:25] doing?" I'm holding on. Amen. The
[1:48:29] scripture said, "What must I do to be
[1:48:31] saved?" It said, "What must I?" Brother
[1:48:33] Brham said, "He never asked, "What must
[1:48:34] my house do? What must I do?"
[1:48:39] That's good. That's good. Brother Bram
[1:48:41] said, "We're so busy telling them what
[1:48:42] not to do. Just tell them what to do."
[1:48:43] Amen.
[1:48:45] Come on now. Believe. Because when you
[1:48:48] believe, there's a there's a sweep of
[1:48:50] the Holy Spirit that even will turn and
[1:48:52] begin to lift you above the things of
[1:48:53] the world. What are you doing, brother
[1:48:54] Sam? I'm holding. I'm holding. I not
[1:48:57] It's not just from my household and my
[1:48:59] my natural family and different ones.
[1:49:01] I'm holding for everyone in the
[1:49:03] household of God. I'm holding for every
[1:49:05] life. I'm holding for every heart. Come
[1:49:07] on, friends. I'm holding on for
[1:49:09] everyone. I will not I will not give up.
[1:49:13] [Applause]
[1:49:16] Amen.
[1:49:18] Sometimes you have to just commit things
[1:49:19] in the hands of God and let God work it
[1:49:22] out. That's right. Right. Let God work
[1:49:25] it out. God knows how to work everything
[1:49:26] out. Yes, he does. Right.
[1:49:29] So this strong drink and wine and it's
[1:49:31] got them all out of the way and man
[1:49:34] they're just you know you take people
[1:49:35] like I said they they all of a sudden
[1:49:37] man they can be the oh they're not very
[1:49:39] talkative get a little something in
[1:49:43] them right you can take a man might be
[1:49:45] about this high
[1:49:49] you get you get something in him what he
[1:49:52] gets in him makes him think he's twice
[1:49:54] his height Uh-huh.
[1:49:58] Is that right? It'll it all of a sudden
[1:50:01] it'll cause him where he kept his
[1:50:03] thoughts to himself, he'll start he'll
[1:50:05] start talking. You keep on getting a
[1:50:07] little bit more keep on getting a little
[1:50:09] bit more into him. What's he doing? He's
[1:50:10] losing sight of himself and his
[1:50:14] surroundings. Now, let me just say this.
[1:50:17] There is a good part when we apply this
[1:50:19] spiritually and there's a bad part.
[1:50:22] Amen. The bad part of it is is where
[1:50:25] that a life can become so
[1:50:29] intoxicated with the things of life. The
[1:50:33] scripture tells us that drunken with the
[1:50:36] aares of the world
[1:50:40] and we just become oblivious to what's
[1:50:44] going on around us and even where our
[1:50:47] life
[1:50:48] is with God.
[1:50:51] And there's a good part about it to
[1:50:53] where a person can get so drunk on
[1:50:58] God, it'll actually cause them to lose
[1:51:02] offenses in their heart against their
[1:51:05] brother. That's so good. That is so
[1:51:08] true. It'll actually cause them to treat
[1:51:11] those that would be regarded and they
[1:51:14] would have a right to say enemy. He'll
[1:51:16] actually cause them to treat them with
[1:51:18] such love and respect. What will do
[1:51:21] that? Just drinking the right kind of
[1:51:24] thing. But if you get to sipping the
[1:51:26] wrong kind of thing, you be careful
[1:51:29] because it can actually cause you to
[1:51:31] build bitterness and you actually get
[1:51:33] drunk on bitterness and waiting for
[1:51:35] somebody else to die. That's so good.
[1:51:37] That's so good. But let me just tell
[1:51:39] you, you don't want bitterness.
[1:51:41] There there there's one who took
[1:51:42] bitterness for you. That's right.
[1:51:44] We might have a right. I'm not saying we
[1:51:46] don't have a right. But let me just say
[1:51:47] like this. Lord, you took it for me. If
[1:51:50] there's
[1:51:52] anybody cuz he never offended nobody. I
[1:51:55] mean, he never did nothing wrong. Hello.
[1:51:58] He never did nothing wrong. Right. He
[1:52:01] knew no sin. Right. And here he was
[1:52:04] being spit on, mocked, ridiculed,
[1:52:06] everything else. And they offered him
[1:52:08] the bitter the bitter cup.
[1:52:12] And he took it. You know why? So you and
[1:52:14] I don't have to drink it. We don't have
[1:52:16] to live with our life filled with
[1:52:18] poison.
[1:52:20] It might be poison from when you were a
[1:52:22] little girl or a little boy. Put that
[1:52:24] cup down. Stop drinking that cup and
[1:52:27] drink the cup of salvation. Drink the
[1:52:30] cup of the Lord.
[1:52:32] Hallelujah. It'll release you from those
[1:52:35] complexes. It'll release you from those
[1:52:37] holds and that torment that wants to
[1:52:40] hold over your life. He's offered you a
[1:52:42] cup that no other man could offer you.
[1:52:47] It is the cup of his own life, of his
[1:52:50] own fellowship. He has extended to you
[1:52:53] in the betroal.
[1:52:58] Amen.
[1:53:00] Lord, that's good preaching. Yes, sir.
[1:53:04] Lordise,
[1:53:06] it's a
[1:53:07] discerning of the body. Hallelujah. how
[1:53:11] it's an we're living in a time where
[1:53:14] these things taking place. But Brandon
[1:53:17] says where it's abomination to God for a
[1:53:20] woman to put on the garment that
[1:53:22] pertains to a man. Right? It's a truth.
[1:53:25] He says now brother Ram's going through
[1:53:27] all this this the discerning the body of
[1:53:28] the Lord. That'd be a good one to listen
[1:53:30] to along with discernment of spirit. I
[1:53:32] gave that to you on Thursday night. And
[1:53:35] listen friends, here's why. I've got
[1:53:38] loved ones, okay, that at one time they
[1:53:42] never would have cut their
[1:53:45] hair under the church of God under
[1:53:48] holiness.
[1:53:50] But over the
[1:53:51] years, you know what's been said?
[1:53:54] They've Oh, well, Paul, this is what
[1:53:56] Paul meant. Let me tell you what Paul
[1:53:58] meant. He meant what he wrote.
[1:54:02] And you want to let me just tell you
[1:54:03] something. You want to know God? Why God
[1:54:05] regards? and he'll lay that down with
[1:54:07] the woman and the sacredness because let
[1:54:09] me tell you something, God never chose
[1:54:11] the man to be a type of the church. He
[1:54:13] chose the woman. You are a type of his
[1:54:17] virtuous, spotless bride.
[1:54:21] And you know what long hair means? This
[1:54:22] is scripture. First Corinthians 11, it
[1:54:25] speaks they have power on their head
[1:54:27] because of the angels. And the prophet
[1:54:30] said, "What that long hair shows is they
[1:54:32] have come under that angel's message.
[1:54:36] They are under the authority of the
[1:54:38] word. That's what long hair is. It's a
[1:54:40] veil. Paul wrote of it. Well, you say,
[1:54:43] "What is long hair?" Cuz maybe, you
[1:54:45] know, some have problems cuz their their
[1:54:47] hair don't grow real long. Long hair is
[1:54:49] uncut hair.
[1:54:52] Well, I'm just trimming the dead ends.
[1:54:55] I don't mean to offend you, but that's
[1:54:57] dumb.
[1:54:59] Your hair don't grow from down here
[1:55:01] down. It grows from here. Amen.
[1:55:04] And what what listen that's just how it
[1:55:07] is. Well, I'm going to trim this and
[1:55:08] trim. But this is what I'm trying to
[1:55:10] say. You know, there comes to a place to
[1:55:12] just just let that be aside. Say, God, I
[1:55:15] recognize by the discernment of the word
[1:55:17] that that's an abomination. God, let me
[1:55:19] tell you something. God veils his people
[1:55:22] by the word. Hallelujah. How does he
[1:55:24] veil you? By the garment of the word.
[1:55:27] You are sealed. You are clothed. Anybody
[1:55:29] ever go in a bank? Anybody ever go in a
[1:55:31] bank? Come on. I know y'all going
[1:55:35] banks. Have you Everybody got a loan?
[1:55:38] Uhhuh. I know you said, "I went and
[1:55:40] bought eggs. I got a
[1:55:43] loan." But every time you ever went and
[1:55:45] got a loan, Brother Ryan, when you went
[1:55:46] and got a loan, did they show you the
[1:55:48] gold? No. No. They don't even put out
[1:55:52] stacks of money on their desks, do they?
[1:55:54] No.
[1:55:56] It's
[1:55:57] hidden. And that's how God does with the
[1:55:59] gold.
[1:56:00] The gold is hidden beneath the garment
[1:56:03] of his word.
[1:56:05] Deity is clothed with the garment of his
[1:56:08] word. It's clothed with the
[1:56:10] righteousness.
[1:56:13] This is why Paul said that the women
[1:56:15] first Timothy 3 should be adorned in
[1:56:19] modest apparel. Modest doesn't mean what
[1:56:21] the newest fashion is. Modest, the very
[1:56:24] word. I'm not making this up. It's free
[1:56:27] flowing garments. Right? Because it can
[1:56:31] be long skirts that'll go clear to the
[1:56:34] ankle, but it'll show every curve of the
[1:56:36] body.
[1:56:37] Oh, I'm preaching now. But see, the
[1:56:40] spirit of discernment. Now, listen,
[1:56:41] listen, listen. This is why the the
[1:56:43] prophet over and over as they would say
[1:56:45] to him, "How can you tear women up? How
[1:56:47] can you do?" He wasn't tearing women up.
[1:56:49] He's trying, you know, he's trying to do
[1:56:50] head them off before the judgment.
[1:56:52] Because where did those women get that?
[1:56:54] The brother Brandon tells us, he said,
[1:56:56] "Jaclyn Kenny with that waterhead
[1:56:58] haircut." He said, "Now I look across
[1:56:59] the Pentecostals and I see these
[1:57:01] waterhead haircuts in here." He said,
[1:57:03] "But if she had sat in my meetings and
[1:57:06] heard my preaching, she maybe wouldn't
[1:57:08] do that."
[1:57:10] [Applause]
[1:57:11] He said, "But you've heard the word and
[1:57:13] you'll give an account for it."
[1:57:16] Brother Samuel, I can't help it. Yes,
[1:57:18] you can. There's a blood.
[1:57:22] The spirit of truth, the spirit of
[1:57:24] discernment says, "Yes, you can. Greater
[1:57:27] is he that's in you. There is a blood to
[1:57:30] take care of your situation. The spirit
[1:57:32] of discernment looks beyond all of the
[1:57:35] doubts, all of the darkness.
[1:57:40] And let me say this to you as men. It'll
[1:57:42] cause you to be real men.
[1:57:45] We're living in an age and a time of
[1:57:48] demasculization of men
[1:57:51] where men men are stuck in front of
[1:57:54] video game machines and their wives out
[1:57:56] working.
[1:57:58] We're down in the basement.
[1:58:01] Come on, somebody.
[1:58:04] Hallelujah. Listen, this was not
[1:58:06] something that was prepared.
[1:58:09] This dropped at moments before I left my
[1:58:11] house.
[1:58:16] But here we are in a time and you know
[1:58:18] what happens with it? It causes now why
[1:58:20] is depression and anxiety on the rise is
[1:58:24] because the true value of who God
[1:58:26] intended you as young men as young
[1:58:28] ladies who he intended you to be and
[1:58:30] Satan wants to come in through innocency
[1:58:32] and strip it away. It's a devaluing of
[1:58:36] what God inquired for you to be. Amen.
[1:58:40] Wonder where it's at in this hour. Let
[1:58:42] me just say this to you. The same God
[1:58:44] that broke the darkness over your life
[1:58:46] is the same God that can do it for your
[1:58:48] son. Do it for your daughter.
[1:58:51] It won't be words that'll talk it out of
[1:58:53] them. But let me tell you something. You
[1:58:54] know what makes a difference in these
[1:58:56] services? You know what's made a
[1:58:57] difference in your life is when you seen
[1:58:59] Jesus Christ that he's alive and well.
[1:59:01] Listen, don't try to convince them. Just
[1:59:03] live it. Say, "God, let my life be so
[1:59:05] rich. Let the spirit of discernment so
[1:59:08] permeate through my life that what will
[1:59:10] it happen that how the life that's being
[1:59:13] lived that when you get around them?
[1:59:14] Conviction.
[1:59:18] And it's not a conviction that'll run
[1:59:20] somebody in a corner because there's an
[1:59:21] atmosphere around you that they love to
[1:59:23] be around you. It's a mystery. They
[1:59:26] can't understand it. What do I do? Keep
[1:59:29] shining the light.
[1:59:31] Hallelujah.
[1:59:33] Amen. It's the spirit of discernment
[1:59:37] that will break back the seals. The
[1:59:39] spirit of discernment that'll break back
[1:59:41] the confusion. Amen.
[1:59:44] Tell you, God's called you and I to be
[1:59:46] sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[1:59:51] Brother Bram says, you know, he says a
[1:59:54] woman dresses herself like that, she's
[1:59:56] going to be guilty of adultery at that
[1:59:57] day of judgment. It's like somebody, you
[1:59:59] know, somebody
[2:00:01] said about brother Bram's visions. I And
[2:00:04] I'm just, you know, this look, this is
[2:00:05] this is my church. I'm pastor here. So,
[2:00:08] it's kind of like being at my
[2:00:10] table. If I want the water on this end,
[2:00:12] water's coming on this end. But I'm just
[2:00:14] going to preach here. I don't under I to
[2:00:17] me it it, you know, I just say it like
[2:00:21] this. God has not called us to try to go
[2:00:24] through and try to figure out the
[2:00:27] message. No. No. If it's been revealed
[2:00:30] to you, preach it.
[2:00:32] [Applause]
[2:00:33] And it ain't going to prove it out just
[2:00:35] by, well, this and that and this and
[2:00:37] that and this and that. But you know
[2:00:38] what? You got to you got to have a real
[2:00:40] meeting with God to where you recognize
[2:00:43] this is not man's ideas. This is eagle
[2:00:46] food from the throne of almighty God.
[2:00:51] That's what it has to become to you.
[2:00:54] And I'm going to tell you, if it's
[2:00:55] nothing but dos and don'ts, if that
[2:00:57] doesn't get changed, you're headed for
[2:00:58] tribulation.
[2:01:01] And when the rapture comes, don't expect
[2:01:03] a text on telegram from me.
[2:01:10] I'm not saying that to scare you,
[2:01:11] friend, but we're living in a time of
[2:01:12] reality. The Bible said there'll be two
[2:01:14] in a bed, one taken, one left. Two
[2:01:16] grinding at the mill, one taken, one
[2:01:18] left. It shows you the closeness. Where
[2:01:20] where is this going to happen, Lord?
[2:01:22] Wheresoever the carcass is there where
[2:01:23] the eagles be gathered together. Where
[2:01:26] is the closeness going to happen? Right
[2:01:27] around where the revealed word is at.
[2:01:30] That's why right now you want to receive
[2:01:32] that of the spirit of discernment
[2:01:34] bringing it down into your life and say,
[2:01:36] "I'm going to take my side with the
[2:01:37] word." I don't care what it costs me.
[2:01:40] I'm laying everything aside. You know
[2:01:42] what you are? Maybe your makeup or your
[2:01:43] clothes or your your your you know your
[2:01:45] your your dreams of being this and doing
[2:01:48] that and doing this. Maybe when you get
[2:01:49] to looking at it, you realize it ain't
[2:01:51] nothing but popcorn and peanuts.
[2:01:53] And you realize the train's coming in,
[2:01:55] the next flight's coming. Hallelujah.
[2:01:58] Amen. I don't got time. You know, when
[2:02:00] we were in between flights, I know this
[2:02:01] is carnal, but it'll help you. We were
[2:02:03] in between flights. We pulled I wanted
[2:02:04] to be home. So, we flew all night from
[2:02:06] Edmonton, flew into Atlanta, man, I was
[2:02:09] 50 minutes. I thought, "Dear Lord, we
[2:02:10] missed customs in in Edmonton, man. I've
[2:02:13] got to get Man, I'll be down there be
[2:02:15] time for coffee. They'll be open at that
[2:02:17] time." And I cuz I don't drink coffee on
[2:02:19] an airplane. But uh I'll tell you that
[2:02:21] on different reasons. But anyhow uh you
[2:02:23] know when I when I'm I get in there, we
[2:02:25] ain't having time for nothing. We barely
[2:02:28] got to the next plane.
[2:02:31] My wife ran ahead of
[2:02:34] me. That's why I'll take
[2:02:38] her. Dad, she still got that softball
[2:02:41] sprint
[2:02:43] down. I didn't have time to get a
[2:02:46] coffee.
[2:02:47] I didn't have time, brother Brian. I
[2:02:49] knew I didn't have time to do
[2:02:52] nothing. Let me tell you, if you can
[2:02:54] really see it in this hour, listen, lay
[2:02:57] aside everything else. It's a time to
[2:03:00] lay aside every weight and every sin
[2:03:02] that doesn't need and beset you. And
[2:03:04] let's run this race. Amen. I'm not
[2:03:06] saying that your dreams or your wants
[2:03:08] are peanuts and popcorn, but anything
[2:03:11] that delights you and taking you away
[2:03:14] from the flashing red lights of his
[2:03:16] coming, throw it down.
[2:03:20] Throw it down. It's not worth it.
[2:03:23] It's not worth missing the rapture. It's
[2:03:25] not worth
[2:03:27] [Applause]
[2:03:30] because it ain't just coming to this
[2:03:31] church that'll put you in a rapture.
[2:03:33] You've got to get in Jesus Christ. Seek
[2:03:36] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[2:03:39] righteousness. What is the kingdom of
[2:03:41] God? It's Christ in you. Amen. The Holy
[2:03:46] Ghost. Amen. If you've repented of your
[2:03:49] sins and been baptized in the name of
[2:03:51] the Lord Jesus Christ, then let God and
[2:03:55] ask him to sanctify your life. Amen. And
[2:03:59] say, "God, clean me up. Take me all the
[2:04:01] way. I want to be united with you. I
[2:04:04] don't want to be a flirtter.
[2:04:07] I don't want to flirt with you, Lord.
[2:04:11] I don't just I don't want you to be a
[2:04:13] side boyfriend. I don't want you to be a
[2:04:15] pick me up when others drop me and dump
[2:04:18] me. I I want Lord, you're going to be
[2:04:19] the main man. Amen. Hallelujah. That's
[2:04:23] so good. That's so good. Let me tell
[2:04:26] you, he's more than anything else.
[2:04:30] He's a friend that'll stick us closer
[2:04:32] than a brother
[2:04:35] through ups and downs, through though as
[2:04:37] times change in our life.
[2:04:40] Even from when we go from, you know, we
[2:04:43] go through and times in our life of
[2:04:45] coldness, he don't divorce us.
[2:04:49] He don't look at us and say, "You sorry
[2:04:51] thing." Remember in the Hebrew series
[2:04:54] and message of grace, let me bring these
[2:04:55] two together. The prophet said, "When I
[2:04:57] married my wife," he said, "It's grace
[2:05:00] that done it for her. Grace made meaty
[2:05:03] brown." He said, "If she never washes
[2:05:05] the dishes, never cleans the clothes,
[2:05:08] lets the house go, whatever, she still
[2:05:10] is my wife."
[2:05:13] Because that's what grace did for her.
[2:05:15] But because she has accepted that grace,
[2:05:19] she shows her appreciation
[2:05:23] with the dishes that's washed, the
[2:05:24] clothes, and on and on.
[2:05:26] I know some of the sisters now say,
[2:05:28] "Thank God for wrinkle-free shirts.
[2:05:33] I know I do when I
[2:05:35] travel. Let me bring it down here.
[2:05:37] There's just no way we're going
[2:05:39] to." Brother Bram says, "You know, to
[2:05:42] that woman, he says, you might be pure
[2:05:44] as a lily to your husband or
[2:05:47] boyfriend." Now, it comes back to my
[2:05:49] point. When a person said that about one
[2:05:51] of the visions of brother Brandham when
[2:05:52] brother Brown said it'll get to a spot
[2:05:56] that
[2:05:57] women will not have well anything else
[2:06:00] and be completely naked and are having
[2:06:02] just nothing but just a a little
[2:06:04] something to cover the
[2:06:05] front. Now let me tell you something.
[2:06:08] We've got stores filled with this stuff
[2:06:11] now.
[2:06:13] I don't know if I'm going to get the
[2:06:14] name right or not. Lululemon and
[2:06:16] whatever more it is. But everywhere you
[2:06:19] walk, listen, I'm not condemning women.
[2:06:22] I'm telling you this right here. Walking
[2:06:24] around with all of that aerobic clothing
[2:06:27] on. Yeah. Come on now. And all these
[2:06:29] things that's got on, it shows every
[2:06:31] aspect of the body.
[2:06:33] It's nakedness.
[2:06:36] Come on. You got quiet on me, but it's
[2:06:39] true.
[2:06:41] Right. Brother said, "It would be this
[2:06:43] way in the last days. It would nearly
[2:06:44] drive the sons of God out of their
[2:06:46] mind." Amen. That's so good. That's
[2:06:49] right. Right. But thank God for the Holy
[2:06:51] Ghost,
[2:06:53] right?
[2:06:54] Right now, cuz there there there's help
[2:06:56] for a man. There's help for a man. Well,
[2:06:57] I can't help it. There. Oh, no. No.
[2:06:59] There is help. There is grace to
[2:07:00] overcome.
[2:07:02] There is grace to put that lust devil
[2:07:04] under your foot. Thank God. Are you
[2:07:06] hearing me? And this thing right here,
[2:07:09] you got to remember this is serpent's
[2:07:11] meat.
[2:07:12] Are you hearing me? You got to you got
[2:07:14] to keep covered by the blood of Jesus
[2:07:16] Christ. Keep in the presence of God. You
[2:07:19] know, when you keep in the presence of
[2:07:20] God, it not only is a repellent against
[2:07:23] lust and sin and everything else, it's a
[2:07:26] repellent against offenses.
[2:07:30] Cuz why is that? You get in the presence
[2:07:33] of true value.
[2:07:36] And I ain't talking about a hardware
[2:07:37] store. I'm talking about eternal life.
[2:07:40] [Applause]
[2:07:42] Hallelujah. Yeah. And here the woman can
[2:07:45] be pure as a lily.
[2:07:47] Hey, listen. You meet good meet good
[2:07:50] women. Good, good, good individuals. But
[2:07:54] the scripture said, "Whosoever lookth
[2:07:56] upon a woman to lust after her has
[2:07:58] committed adultery with her in his heart
[2:08:01] already, right? So you might not have
[2:08:04] done anything wrong actually, but when
[2:08:05] you dressed yourself like that, you
[2:08:07] presented yourself to a man, he's going
[2:08:09] to have to answer for committing
[2:08:10] adultery, and you are the blame. And the
[2:08:13] church is permitting that, not
[2:08:15] discerning the Lord's body. What's the
[2:08:17] Lord's body? The word.
[2:08:21] I tell you right now, as a sister, if
[2:08:23] you've got to wrestle with your skirt
[2:08:24] when you sit down, it's too short.
[2:08:29] It ought not be a wrestling match. You
[2:08:32] have a wrestling match with the angel of
[2:08:34] the Lord. Right
[2:08:37] now, either you got a problem with your
[2:08:39] dryer where you've been looking at other
[2:08:41] things.
[2:08:44] Come on now. Either it's shrinking or
[2:08:46] it's a problem with other things. Oh,
[2:08:48] brother Samuel, that that don't mean a
[2:08:49] dress is address. But let me tell you,
[2:08:51] it should not be showing. Look at these
[2:08:54] styles. Look at these styles and where
[2:08:55] they come from. Look at even the rais.
[2:08:57] Look, these are not things that brother
[2:08:58] Samuel's making up. You look it up. Just
[2:09:00] I tell you what, y'all, you know, you
[2:09:02] all use chat GPT and everything else.
[2:09:05] Dare you ask chat GPT what's modesty,
[2:09:08] right? It'll take it right in here.
[2:09:16] Woo. That's right.
[2:09:21] Well, we don't need artificial
[2:09:22] intelligence.
[2:09:24] We have the mind of Christ
[2:09:27] and we know what he wants done with the
[2:09:29] word.
[2:09:31] We're not prostrating oursel before a
[2:09:33] tablet or before a phone. We are
[2:09:35] prostrating oursel before a God who has
[2:09:38] ears to hear. He has a mouth to speak
[2:09:41] and he's living in a many membered body.
[2:09:45] I'm not packing him around and sat him
[2:09:48] down and worshiping. He's packing
[2:09:51] me. Amen.
[2:09:55] He takes me from place to place. And
[2:09:57] where the camp gets set up and the
[2:09:59] pillar of fire drops down, that's where
[2:10:00] we begin to worship. We begin to have
[2:10:03] fellowship around the things of God.
[2:10:06] It's a spirit of discernment.
[2:10:11] Lord, Ram says, "Let me read this in
[2:10:17] closing. Y'all are like discerning like
[2:10:19] I know better than Well, I I'm listen. I
[2:10:22] I if he takes a hold of something here,
[2:10:24] that's that's what I depend on. But
[2:10:26] notice, Brother Bram says this. I want
[2:10:27] to close with this here this morning. We
[2:10:30] need discernment. That's right. We need
[2:10:34] the discerning by the word. Amen. The
[2:10:37] word's right. Take the word. God's words
[2:10:42] always right. We can't discern by what
[2:10:45] people think, what intellectuals tells
[2:10:47] us, what psychiatrists tell us. We got
[2:10:51] to go by what God says. Man shall not
[2:10:55] live by bread alone, but by every word
[2:10:58] that proceedth out of the mouth of God.
[2:11:01] Not discerning the Lord's body. Many are
[2:11:03] weakly and sick. Many are asleep, dead,
[2:11:07] spiritually dead. The last plague that
[2:11:10] hit Egypt was death. The last plague
[2:11:13] that hits the church is spiritual death.
[2:11:16] Amen. What we need today is a spiritual
[2:11:20] awakening.
[2:11:21] A spiritual awakening to discernment.
[2:11:27] You see what this evening light has
[2:11:29] done?
[2:11:31] It's brought discernment.
[2:11:34] To our lives,
[2:11:36] you know, it's incredible. Has it come
[2:11:38] across our pathway? we you couldn't even
[2:11:40] really maybe even put your finger on. I
[2:11:42] I was born and raised in the message,
[2:11:44] but I'm talking to some of the rest of
[2:11:45] you because I I didn't even understand
[2:11:46] what was going on when I was sitting
[2:11:50] here. But, you know, things come across
[2:11:53] your pathway and you can't even you
[2:11:54] can't even put your finger on it.
[2:11:55] There's just something different. I
[2:11:57] mean, for me, I knew there was something
[2:11:58] different. I just couldn't put my finger
[2:12:00] on it.
[2:12:02] You know, you you kind of look at things
[2:12:03] and you're looking at things like look
[2:12:05] at how this believed the Baptist and how
[2:12:07] this and how that and you know, you're
[2:12:09] looking at that. I I mean, you're just
[2:12:11] kind of looking, but until God comes by,
[2:12:14] right, and makes himself known to you. I
[2:12:16] know there was a difference, right? I
[2:12:18] know there was a difference in the way
[2:12:21] that my parents lived. I knew there was
[2:12:23] a difference from where with with with
[2:12:25] so many others that were good people. I
[2:12:27] had people that, man, gave me jobs. Good
[2:12:30] people. good
[2:12:32] people. But when the word itself begins
[2:12:35] to deal with your life and begins to
[2:12:37] stir something in your heart and won't
[2:12:39] let you
[2:12:41] remain where you're at and you can't
[2:12:44] even put your finger on it. It's just
[2:12:47] like something erupts out of you like it
[2:12:48] did Peter. Thou hast the words of
[2:12:50] eternal life. Where did that come from?
[2:12:53] Down in there. It was there the whole
[2:12:55] time.
[2:12:57] It recognized it. What was it? The
[2:12:59] spirit of truth,
[2:13:01] the testimony of a true witness, the
[2:13:04] spirit of discernment by the word
[2:13:06] brought that out of your life.
[2:13:09] And what did it do? You found that
[2:13:11] field.
[2:13:13] You found in and that treasure and you
[2:13:15] were willing to sell everything else.
[2:13:18] You found that pearl of great price.
[2:13:19] You're willing to forell everything
[2:13:20] else. Why? This means more to me than
[2:13:22] everything. I want him. Amen. I want
[2:13:24] him. Amen. I want him. That's what means
[2:13:27] more to you than anything else. And let
[2:13:28] me just say this, it's him. It's got to
[2:13:32] be him. He's more I believe in feelings.
[2:13:34] I believe in all the but it's got to be
[2:13:36] him. He's what you want. Amen. Because
[2:13:39] when you have him, it don't matter if
[2:13:40] you have good feelings or bad feelings.
[2:13:42] You've got him.
[2:13:44] And then as you begin to think on him
[2:13:45] and he comes by, you'll get good
[2:13:47] feelings.
[2:13:49] Oh yeah.
[2:13:53] He begins to whisper over you and say,
[2:13:55] "You're always the apple of my eye." Woo
[2:13:58] boy. Oh, bless. We don't go by feelings.
[2:14:00] Speak for yourself in those moments that
[2:14:03] begins to just ruffle these feather down
[2:14:05] on the
[2:14:07] inside. Oh, how I love to hear his
[2:14:10] voice.
[2:14:13] And you know why I can have confidence
[2:14:14] when he says that? Because the spirit of
[2:14:17] truth will also tell me. That's right.
[2:14:20] When I'm wrong.
[2:14:22] He can say, "Samuel, that's a little bit
[2:14:24] too short. Samuel, that's a little bit.
[2:14:27] And what is he doing? He's guiding me.
[2:14:30] Right. Right. You see, he didn't save me
[2:14:34] and walk away from me. No. Amen. He's
[2:14:36] not one that's disinterested in his
[2:14:40] creation. The prophet said he's right in
[2:14:42] the midst of the seven golden
[2:14:45] candlesticks.
[2:14:46] He's not an onlooker. He is right now
[2:14:50] governing in the affairs of men. All
[2:14:53] right. There is nothing that can take
[2:14:57] place without God permitting it.
[2:15:02] No wonder the prophet when he preaches
[2:15:03] God of this evil age, he says, "So
[2:15:06] what's going on? Has God lost
[2:15:10] control?" Ah, he said, "But in my true
[2:15:14] opinion, what's taking place is the Holy
[2:15:17] Spirit, there's two spirits here. The
[2:15:19] Holy Spirit is calling a bride by
[2:15:21] vindicating his word. And there's an
[2:15:24] unholy spirit, Satan, calling an
[2:15:26] intellectual bride through science.
[2:15:30] And it's to disprove the word of
[2:15:32] God. Let me say this to you. All the way
[2:15:36] down through the ages, what what what
[2:15:38] the spirit has wanted to do because it
[2:15:40] cannot get at that life. It's wanted to
[2:15:43] destroy the vessel that it's worked
[2:15:45] through. Amen. It tries to discredit the
[2:15:49] vessel.
[2:15:52] It did that to Abel. He died on his
[2:15:55] altar. Is that right? All the way
[2:15:58] through. It's tried to discredit every
[2:16:01] one of them that God's worked through.
[2:16:03] And that same spirit has tried to do the
[2:16:05] same thing with the messenger of this
[2:16:07] day. Sure.
[2:16:10] He stood right He stood right in Chicago
[2:16:12] and said, "Bring your Bible and stand
[2:16:15] right here." If I've said something
[2:16:17] wrong about the Godhead, come here and
[2:16:20] disprove it. And brother Brandham says
[2:16:22] they knew better because the angel of
[2:16:23] the Lord was standing there. Let me say
[2:16:26] this to you. The angel of the Lord has
[2:16:28] never left. He accompanies the message.
[2:16:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Become established on
[2:16:38] the rock of Jesus Christ. Don't stumble
[2:16:41] over it. Don't fall over it. Don't let
[2:16:44] it come down on you, but just say,
[2:16:45] "Lord, consume me."
[2:16:49] I just Let's Let's close here this
[2:16:51] morning on this and we'll just stop
[2:16:56] there. Just here this morning as we look
[2:16:58] at it and evaluate it, the spirit of
[2:17:01] discernment. Friend, if there's ever an
[2:17:02] hour and a time that we need discernment
[2:17:05] in our own lives, it's right now.
[2:17:09] It's right now.
[2:17:11] If there's ever a time that you need to
[2:17:12] be honest with yourself, it's right now.
[2:17:15] And to be honest before God. Now you you
[2:17:18] look you know in your own life if you've
[2:17:23] drifted if there's anything within your
[2:17:25] life that's not lined up with God if
[2:17:28] there's things that you went off oh
[2:17:30] that's just brother Samuel I've not I've
[2:17:33] not preached anything
[2:17:35] but what hadn't come from the message
[2:17:37] and the scriptures if I've said
[2:17:39] something that you find is not in the
[2:17:41] scriptures you owe it to me to come and
[2:17:44] sit down with me
[2:17:46] I don't argue with nobody. But I know
[2:17:49] where I'm standing.
[2:17:52] I'm not preaching from a maybe or or a
[2:17:54] perhaps. You couldn't have confidence.
[2:17:56] And let me tell you where that come
[2:17:57] from. It didn't come from any Browning
[2:17:59] genetics.
[2:18:02] Because on the way here, I had I held my
[2:18:04] wife's hands and I said, "The Lord's
[2:18:06] changing what I'm going to speak and I'm
[2:18:08] not exactly sure where I'm going."
[2:18:12] But you know what? when he comes. And
[2:18:14] what I'm saying to you is it's his word
[2:18:16] that brings certainty in your life. You
[2:18:19] want to live an overcoming life, come
[2:18:21] beneath the blood. Amen. You want to
[2:18:24] live a victorious life, come beneath the
[2:18:25] blood. Amen. Well, I'll just put Don't
[2:18:27] put it off to another day. You may not
[2:18:29] have another day. You may not have
[2:18:31] another opportunity. You can walk right
[2:18:33] out of here right now and Satan can tell
[2:18:35] you it'll be for another day. You may
[2:18:37] not have another day.
[2:18:39] Well, I'll wait till another time. Today
[2:18:41] is the day of salvation.
[2:18:45] Well, I believe the message of the hour,
[2:18:47] but remember the prophet tells us in the
[2:18:50] message token, just to come around where
[2:18:52] it's at is to make yourself worse.
[2:18:57] The message is come under the blood.
[2:19:03] Amen. I'm a good person. I'm I'm not
[2:19:06] saying you're not a good person, but
[2:19:08] what I'm asking you, are you one with
[2:19:11] God?
[2:19:13] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:19:16] you believed?
[2:19:18] Is your life in line with God's word?
[2:19:21] Well, I know all about I'm not asking
[2:19:22] you to know all about the message. Turn
[2:19:24] that enticing spirit down and receive
[2:19:27] the spirit of truth.
[2:19:29] Don't go upon all of your knowledge on
[2:19:31] words and and I've prayed for this one
[2:19:33] and I've spoke tongues here and I've
[2:19:35] done that. Don't base. That's an
[2:19:37] enticing spirit.
[2:19:39] That wants to distract you from what God
[2:19:42] wants for you.
[2:19:44] But right here is a moment in his
[2:19:47] presence. And you know all it takes is a
[2:19:49] moment. That's right. It takes a moment
[2:19:51] where you say, "You know what? I'm
[2:19:53] throwing these peanuts down. I'm
[2:19:55] throwing this popcorn down. I'm throwing
[2:19:57] this down." Maybe you've sat and you've
[2:19:58] made excuse. Well, I'm going to wait
[2:20:00] till God takes this from me. I'm gonna
[2:20:01] wait till God takes this from me. He
[2:20:03] wants to take it from you. That's right.
[2:20:05] Amen. If you'll just let him come in,
[2:20:07] you'll just let him come in. He'll take
[2:20:09] it from you. You say, "How will he do
[2:20:10] it?" Just like he did the music from me.
[2:20:13] Or you might pick it back up and then
[2:20:15] you put it back down. Pick it back up.
[2:20:16] But don't then you're not defeated just
[2:20:19] because you picked it back up. Maybe you
[2:20:21] put it on or maybe you tried them on or
[2:20:23] maybe you listen to this or what. You're
[2:20:25] not defeated. take it back off and say,
[2:20:27] "In the name of Jesus Christ, I lay this
[2:20:29] thing down. I lay it down in the name of
[2:20:32] Jesus Christ."
[2:20:34] Whatever besetting sin that's hindered
[2:20:37] you, lay it down in the name of the Lord
[2:20:39] Jesus Christ. He's a mighty conqueror.
[2:20:43] Let me tell you, he's above pornography.
[2:20:48] He's above lust. Let me tell you, he's
[2:20:51] high and lifted up. He ain't just barely
[2:20:54] above it. He's high and lifted up. Amen.
[2:20:58] It might have been you got a little cold
[2:21:00] on God and I told you you got to stay in
[2:21:01] God's presence. But there's something
[2:21:04] that aren you to rise up and say, "Lord,
[2:21:05] I want to go deeper. Lord, I want more
[2:21:08] of you." Let the Holy Spirit, let him
[2:21:10] sort it out and discern it out right in
[2:21:12] our life. But within every one of us,
[2:21:13] Lord, I want to soar in that spirit of
[2:21:15] discernment because you know what
[2:21:16] happens when you get under this this
[2:21:18] eagle anointing?
[2:21:23] Let the devil sweat it out a minute.
[2:21:27] When you get under this eagle anointing,
[2:21:29] how many of you like
[2:21:31] maps? Now, I don't like them 2D
[2:21:36] maps, but they're saying I'm talking
[2:21:37] about Apple
[2:21:39] maps or it can be
[2:21:41] Google. We'll take we'll take the second
[2:21:43] best if the first is not
[2:21:45] available. But you know something about
[2:21:47] these maps?
[2:21:50] You pull up direction to somewhere, it
[2:21:52] gives you the option to look from from
[2:21:55] above. And when you look from above, you
[2:21:58] know what you can do? You can zoom back
[2:22:00] out. Oh, that's a busy way coming in.
[2:22:02] That's a busy way coming in. Oh, this
[2:22:04] way. You know what that is? That's only
[2:22:07] in the natural science. Tapping into
[2:22:09] that, that's what God has done through
[2:22:10] the eagle anointing in this last day.
[2:22:13] You're not just looking at something
[2:22:14] from an earthly view. We've left the man
[2:22:17] anointing. We've left the ox anointing
[2:22:20] feet on the ground. Man was on the
[2:22:22] ground. We left
[2:22:25] Hallelujah. The lion feet on the ground.
[2:22:27] All was the spirit of God working
[2:22:29] through. But now comes the flying eagle.
[2:22:32] What are you doing? You're seeing the
[2:22:34] end. Hallelujah. Why? Cuz you can see
[2:22:37] clear back to the mind of God. I always
[2:22:39] was a son and daughter of God. And the
[2:22:41] enemy says, "Do this or do that." And
[2:22:43] you
[2:22:45] say, "That ain't going to lead me closer
[2:22:47] to God." No.
[2:22:50] What's giving you that viewpoint? The
[2:22:52] eagle.
[2:22:54] You love him.
[2:22:56] Hallelujah. Musicians
[2:22:58] come. Brother Brian, you probably going
[2:23:00] to take it for me.
[2:23:02] It's dryness. It's just the devil
[2:23:04] wanting to try to get to that.
[2:23:06] But let me tell you, don't let it slip
[2:23:09] you by this morning. Right. Amen.
[2:23:14] If you need if you need more of God,
[2:23:17] he's here.
[2:23:19] Don't let it slip you by. Don't be
[2:23:22] ashamed. Oh, brother Sam, I'm ashamed.
[2:23:24] Well, don't Why Why be ashamed of him?
[2:23:26] Don't be ashamed of him. He's not
[2:23:27] ashamed of you. He wasn't ashamed to
[2:23:30] come down here and and give a word like
[2:23:32] this to you and I. He wasn't ashamed.
[2:23:33] Let me just tell you something. I ain't
[2:23:34] a bit ashamed. It's his word. It's his
[2:23:37] grace to you and me. Amen. I said to you
[2:23:40] and me. Amen. If it wasn't for the
[2:23:42] spirit of discernment, where would we
[2:23:43] be? We would be caught up in the rest of
[2:23:47] that pale house gathering.
[2:23:50] But God has sent a word to you and I.
[2:23:54] Come out of her. My people.
[2:23:58] And let me just say this to you here
[2:23:59] this morning. He's here. The Holy Ghost
[2:24:02] is here. The spirit of truth is here.
[2:24:05] The spirit of discernment. He's here.
[2:24:09] Why don't you just make yourself
[2:24:10] available? Just open. Maybe you've
[2:24:14] gotten cold. Make yourself available.
[2:24:16] Say, "God, restore to me that ferveny."
[2:24:20] Amen. That discernment.
[2:24:22] Things that you once used to bother you
[2:24:25] don't seem to bother you no more to do
[2:24:27] it. And now all of a sudden, so you just
[2:24:29] start getting in his presence. And all
[2:24:31] of a sudden, it may not be exactly
[2:24:33] called out, but it just starts something
[2:24:35] just ain't settling right. You know what
[2:24:37] that is? That's the spirit of
[2:24:39] discernment,
[2:24:41] the love of God. You see, this is why
[2:24:44] that the real reality, friends, the
[2:24:46] message of the hour is not dos and
[2:24:48] don'ts. We preach the word of God, but
[2:24:51] it's it's greater than dos and don'ts
[2:24:53] because you can do all the right things
[2:24:55] and not do all the wrong things, but
[2:24:59] that's conformity.
[2:25:02] Say, God, transform me. Right. Amen.
[2:25:06] Change my nature, Lord. Change my
[2:25:09] nature. That's what you're opening up.
[2:25:10] That's why That's why when the things,
[2:25:12] like I said, Brother Samuel, I was I was
[2:25:14] turning it here and then I turn it back
[2:25:15] and turn it here, turn it back. But you
[2:25:17] know what I'm looking for? God, I want
[2:25:18] you. You know what? It wasn't something
[2:25:21] that I was struggling with, per se. That
[2:25:24] kept going on, kept going on. And you
[2:25:25] know what? Every time, let me tell you
[2:25:27] something. You know, every time that
[2:25:28] took place like that, the devil wanted
[2:25:30] to try to discourage me
[2:25:33] and say, "You know what? There ain't
[2:25:34] nothing took place with you. It's just
[2:25:36] like all your other youth camp
[2:25:38] visitations.
[2:25:40] There ain't nothing happened to you."
[2:25:43] But Samuel, what happened during that
[2:25:44] time? Let me tell you what happened. It
[2:25:46] was more than the resolution of Samuel
[2:25:48] Browning.
[2:25:50] It was God. Amen. And this very time
[2:25:52] right now, it didn't feel like a certain
[2:25:55] special time. But let me tell you, it
[2:25:57] was it was God that would give that
[2:25:59] fortitude and that strength and say, "I
[2:26:01] don't want that. I don't want that. I
[2:26:04] don't want to go back to that." It's the
[2:26:05] same God working in you. You're not
[2:26:07] defeated. Oh, brother Sam, I I I've
[2:26:09] fallen back into this. I've fallen back
[2:26:11] into this. Let me It's the spirit of
[2:26:12] discernment that's letting you know who
[2:26:14] you are. And he's giving you discernment
[2:26:17] on how to lay the things of the world
[2:26:19] down. As a matter of fact, he's given
[2:26:21] you authority right here this morning.
[2:26:24] Lay aside.
[2:26:28] Lay it aside. Lay it aside.
[2:26:32] Let him let him. You love him?
[2:26:36] Amen.
[2:26:38] Let's act upon this word, friends. Amen.
[2:26:40] Let's let's take this word. Amen. You
[2:26:43] want prayer here this morning? The altar
[2:26:44] is open. You want prayer. You want to
[2:26:46] you want to come and stand here and say,
[2:26:48] I want to dedicate my life. I want to
[2:26:50] rededicate my life. I don't care if this
[2:26:52] whole place is filled out. Oh, brother
[2:26:53] Sam, you ain't it ain't a place at the
[2:26:55] altar we need. We need our heart to be
[2:26:58] an altar.
[2:27:00] Amen.
[2:27:02] And it's more than us. I realize it's
[2:27:04] more than us just coming to a physical
[2:27:06] location. But sometimes the longest walk
[2:27:08] you'll ever have to take is the walk out
[2:27:10] of your seat to the altar.
[2:27:12] Sure.
[2:27:14] But make sure it's an altar in your
[2:27:15] heart.
[2:27:18] God, I'm tired of playing. I'm I'm tired
[2:27:20] of just walking in the that gray areas.
[2:27:24] Maybe the black and white you're
[2:27:25] struggling with. Say, Lord, I I just I
[2:27:28] give it to you, Lord. Amen. Now, realize
[2:27:30] you don't have to come out of your seat.
[2:27:32] But I want you I want us to take full
[2:27:35] opportunity of
[2:27:36] this. I think the King of glory is here
[2:27:39] right now. The waters are troubled.
[2:27:42] Hallelujah. I want to take opportunity
[2:27:44] of this.
[2:27:46] Not at all what I had planned to
[2:27:48] minister this morning. Not at
[2:27:52] all. But this is why I couldn't get
[2:27:54] peace even yesterday and throughout the
[2:27:57] time. But he knows. And let me tell you,
[2:28:00] he cares. He cares for you. He loves
[2:28:05] you. You say, "H, how do I know?"
[2:28:08] Because he said so. He came down from
[2:28:10] glory for you.
[2:28:13] And he sent his spirit. That's him. That
[2:28:15] ain't somebody else. That's right. It
[2:28:17] ain't like me sending, you know, the
[2:28:19] little little Aaron here and sending him
[2:28:21] back to the to brother Gomez say, "Go
[2:28:22] tell brother Gomez this." No, no. If I
[2:28:24] got something to tell brother Gomez,
[2:28:26] I'll go myself. That's how God did.
[2:28:28] Amen. God didn't send somebody else. He
[2:28:30] came himself to where you're at. Amen.
[2:28:33] He didn't send somebody down in the
[2:28:34] garden, somebody else. He came himself.
[2:28:37] Adam. Adam, where are you?
[2:28:41] And what happened? his
[2:28:45] presence. I said, "Bob, fellowship is
[2:28:49] broke. We're naked. We're
[2:28:52] naked." And he said, "Who told you you
[2:28:55] were
[2:28:57] naked?" Oh, God already knew it. He was
[2:29:01] just wanting
[2:29:02] Adam to come forth.
[2:29:06] And when Adam came forth, he was
[2:29:08] standing there clothed in fig
[2:29:11] [Music]
[2:29:13] leaves. He could have had big old
[2:29:17] leaves, but he had fig leaves. You know
[2:29:20] why? Your clothing says
[2:29:25] something. How many know what I'm
[2:29:27] talking about? Oh, yeah.
[2:29:28] When Judah went up with the sheep, Tamar
[2:29:33] knew that Judah was coming and she put
[2:29:36] on garments, right? Took off the
[2:29:39] garments of widowhood and put on
[2:29:41] garments that would make him think she
[2:29:44] was a harlot.
[2:29:46] Clothing speaks. What you're wearing
[2:29:49] speaks Listen, the Holy Ghost, the blood
[2:29:52] speaks better things.
[2:29:54] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:29:57] Why fig leaves? Because figs is the only
[2:30:00] thing you can have multiple seeds in
[2:30:05] one. They were clothed with
[2:30:08] [Music]
[2:30:10] religion. But God in his
[2:30:13] mercy, he took an innocent woman, a
[2:30:17] lamb, and he took animal skins and threw
[2:30:21] it in behind the bush. Said, "Put these
[2:30:24] on." Hallelujah. and come
[2:30:28] out. God wanted fellowship.
[2:30:32] And he said, "I will make a way back."
[2:30:36] He was showing them it would have to be
[2:30:39] animal blood. Man is the height of the
[2:30:41] animal kingdom. It would have to be an
[2:30:43] innocent one that was slain. God gave
[2:30:45] them the types down through the
[2:30:46] scriptures and in a heer, that of an ox,
[2:30:49] that of the, you know, of the sheep, all
[2:30:51] of that innocent, the turtle dove, the
[2:30:52] innocent. But it was all speaking of the
[2:30:55] coming of the perfect lamb of God. And
[2:30:58] when he came, he identified himself as a
[2:31:03] lamb. And in the heavens, here came the
[2:31:06] dove to come down with the
[2:31:08] [Music]
[2:31:11] lamb. Think about
[2:31:13] it. Lord, I want to be clothed in your
[2:31:17] righteousness.
[2:31:19] Hallelujah. I don't want to be clothed
[2:31:21] in my own works. Amen.
[2:31:24] I don't want to be clothed with
[2:31:28] I I want that
[2:31:29] discernment of the spirit. Maybe in your
[2:31:32] life you just say, you know, my I I need
[2:31:34] that that filing down like they do on
[2:31:37] the contacts of
[2:31:40] electrodes. Sometimes electrodes even on
[2:31:42] my even on my microphone sometimes I
[2:31:44] have to take an alcohol wipe and just
[2:31:47] take away the corrosion off the contacts
[2:31:49] and put it back together. Sometimes the
[2:31:52] Holy Spirit comes by to just take away
[2:31:55] the corrosion that's been built up,
[2:31:57] cares of life, disappointments,
[2:32:02] and he takes away that corrosion. You
[2:32:04] know why? To restore the vitality of his
[2:32:08] life in flowing through
[2:32:11] [Music]
[2:32:12] you. How many say Lord have your way?
[2:32:15] Amen. Amen.
[2:32:23] Hallelujah. No wonder our heads are
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:28] bowed. You want to be remembered before
[2:32:30] the Lord in prayer and Lord remember
[2:32:36] me. If you want to come to the altar,
[2:32:38] you're always more than welcome to come.
[2:32:40] Friends, the altar is never closed. And
[2:32:42] I'm not trying to pull you nowhere. I I
[2:32:44] want you to understand
[2:32:48] that. But I want you to take the
[2:32:50] opportunity that you have in God's
[2:32:52] presence. If you need prayer, I'd be
[2:32:55] glad to pray with you. That's no sign of
[2:32:58] weakness. That's humility.
[2:33:02] Heavenly Father,
[2:33:04] [Music]
[2:33:07] Dear
[2:33:09] God, you have so merciful to us, Lord.
[2:33:15] in an hour, in an age, in a time that we
[2:33:17] live.
[2:33:19] Lord God,
[2:33:21] where it's like an anesthetic, a
[2:33:25] numbing is setting
[2:33:29] over, Lord
[2:33:31] God, it wants to just
[2:33:35] numb, numb the
[2:33:38] people, Lord God, where sensitivity is
[2:33:43] lost. Yet this age, what's incredible is
[2:33:46] it's an age where everybody is hyper
[2:33:48] sensitive.
[2:33:50] but all about the wrong
[2:33:52] things. It's all about
[2:33:55] self. But that Lord
[2:33:58] God, that's a
[2:34:01] distraction.
[2:34:04] Father, this great spirit of truth,
[2:34:07] great
[2:34:09] Elohim, our
[2:34:11] mazdc. Oh God, we can do nothing without
[2:34:15] you, Lord.
[2:34:17] Only you Lord can break back Lord
[2:34:21] God. Break away these spirits Lord of
[2:34:26] conformity, laxness,
[2:34:29] Lord. Lord
[2:34:31] Jesus, I pray, oh God.
[2:34:34] [Music]
[2:34:36] Lord
[2:34:38] Jesus, as your prophet said in over and
[2:34:40] over, I'm we're not against
[2:34:43] people, but Lord, the organizations.
[2:34:46] Why? Why?
[2:34:49] Because it comes between you and your
[2:34:54] people.
[2:34:56] It offers them another way. And there is
[2:35:00] no other way.
[2:35:03] It offers us them offers them a way
[2:35:06] where they can be
[2:35:08] religious and satisfy that part about
[2:35:11] them. Cain was
[2:35:13] religious. He came to
[2:35:17] worship. But Lord
[2:35:20] Jesus, you offered him the opportunity
[2:35:23] and he turned it
[2:35:25] down. But Abel, he received a revelation
[2:35:28] from
[2:35:29] you. And Abel walked with that
[2:35:34] revelation, that revelation of the
[2:35:37] atonement. And it became through that
[2:35:41] revelation, he
[2:35:43] obtained a witness that he was
[2:35:48] righteous. Lord God, the spirit of God,
[2:35:51] your spirit, the spirit of truth, it'll
[2:35:53] not come outside of the
[2:35:55] word. It'll come right inside the word.
[2:35:59] This is why as you said the father will
[2:36:02] send the comforter in my
[2:36:04] name. Lord I pray right here this
[2:36:08] morning. Dear God where the enemy Lord
[2:36:11] has wanted to bind and then want to slip
[2:36:14] up Lord God with fear upon hearts and
[2:36:17] lives and beginning to look at Lord as
[2:36:20] though their selfability to do things. I
[2:36:22] pray in the name of Jesus Christ Satan
[2:36:25] you're a liar. Amen. You that would want
[2:36:28] to bring confusion
[2:36:30] and distort the real focus and the
[2:36:32] vision and try to hinder and deaden and
[2:36:34] try to silence the call of the voice of
[2:36:37] Almighty God. I rebuke you and I say to
[2:36:41] this darkness
[2:36:43] give way in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:36:47] Let there be light for the glory of God.
[2:36:51] Let the light shine. this sun that has
[2:36:54] risen,
[2:36:56] let it illuminate, Lord that life.
[2:36:59] Granted, Lord, I pray in the name of
[2:37:02] Jesus Christ, I pray God for hearts and
[2:37:05] lives that Lord, where hands are lifted
[2:37:08] up with hearts that Lord, like a cup
[2:37:11] that's open before you,
[2:37:14] Lord, as a vessel, I empty out, Lord, I
[2:37:19] pour out my
[2:37:20] self-will and I open to you, Lord. Fill
[2:37:24] my cup, Lord. Fill my life with you,
[2:37:26] Lord. Fill me, Lord. Amen. I'm tired of
[2:37:30] being
[2:37:32] me. I want to be one with you,
[2:37:35] Lord. I surrender.
[2:37:38] I surrender, Lord. I accept what you've
[2:37:42] done for me, Lord. I lay down all my
[2:37:45] fruits, all my works,
[2:37:49] Lord. Lord
[2:37:51] God, they didn't do that to be
[2:37:54] wrong. Cain didn't do what he did to be
[2:37:56] wrong. They haven't done things to be
[2:37:58] wrong, but
[2:38:00] God in a moment is where you break back
[2:38:04] the clouds and the veil to let them see.
[2:38:07] It's not about what they could do, but
[2:38:10] accepting what you've done for them,
[2:38:12] Lord.
[2:38:15] Oh father, I pray in the name of the
[2:38:18] Lord Jesus
[2:38:20] Christ. Lord God, may you fill every
[2:38:23] heart,
[2:38:24] Lord. Fill every life, Lord.
[2:38:28] I pray,
[2:38:30] Lord, lives that are gathered here this
[2:38:33] morning, Lord, refill us with your
[2:38:35] presence, Lord.
[2:38:38] Hallelujah. Your desire is not that we
[2:38:41] would be lukewarm, but either hot or
[2:38:44] cold. We want to be hot, Lord. We want
[2:38:47] to be on fire for you.
[2:38:50] Amen.
[2:38:52] Lord God, where that fire of the living
[2:38:54] God is living on the inside of us. Oh,
[2:38:57] it's not that we would act like somebody
[2:38:59] else. That's not it. It's where there's
[2:39:01] a fire on the
[2:39:03] inside where sin has been consumed. The
[2:39:07] desire of sin has passed from our life
[2:39:10] and it's a living reality of the living
[2:39:12] God on the
[2:39:13] inside. It's a fire that windy days
[2:39:16] cannot blow out like the
[2:39:18] candlesticks. It's a light that's not
[2:39:21] like the stars or the sun. If it's a
[2:39:24] nice day like today, my it's wonderful.
[2:39:26] If it's cloudy, terrible day. But Lord
[2:39:30] God, that shikina
[2:39:31] light which was the first light to ever
[2:39:35] strike the earth, the shikina
[2:39:39] light, that's that portion of that
[2:39:43] pillar of
[2:39:44] fire, that portion of the Godhead that
[2:39:48] belongs to us as sons and daughters of
[2:39:51] God. Grant it, Lord. I pray right here
[2:39:53] this
[2:39:54] morning. Lord, as hearts are surrendered
[2:39:57] and submitted to you, Lord, from young
[2:39:59] to old, Lord God, Father, our heart's
[2:40:03] desire, we want to leave out of this
[2:40:05] building this morning. Amen. Closer to
[2:40:08] you, Lord,
[2:40:11] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:40:13] More with a
[2:40:15] greater a discernment.
[2:40:19] That spirit of discernment has been so
[2:40:21] rekindled in our lives, Lord, to it's
[2:40:24] not looking at other people, but we're
[2:40:27] able to apply the greatest discernment,
[2:40:30] and that's to our own
[2:40:32] self. Help us, Lord, I
[2:40:35] pray. Grant it, Lord, in the name of
[2:40:37] Jesus Christ, for the glory of Almighty
[2:40:40] God. And Lord, as your presence is here,
[2:40:43] we will forget not your benefits, Lord.
[2:40:45] May you heal those that are sick in
[2:40:47] their body, Lord.
[2:40:49] May you move upon lives this morning
[2:40:51] Lord in a special way. I pray in Jesus
[2:40:54] precious
[2:40:55] name.
[2:40:57] Amen. Hallelujah. Could we just worship
[2:41:00] him
[2:41:03] here?
[2:41:10] Hallelujah. Oh my. Don't let it pass you
[2:41:13] by.
[2:41:14] was the best
[2:41:15] [Music]
[2:41:18] thing.
[2:41:20] Oh,
[2:41:22] falling in love. Falling in love. Oh,
[2:41:28] with
[2:41:35] Jes.
[2:41:40] Hallelujah. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[2:41:44] Oh my. My our Lord Jesus.
[2:41:48] Oh, he's
[2:41:50] here.
[2:41:54] Hallelujah.
[2:41:59] Hallelujah. In his
[2:42:03] arms. I
[2:42:05] feel
[2:42:09] protected. In his arms.
[2:42:14] Never
[2:42:17] connected. It is
[2:42:23] our
[2:42:25] protected. There's no place I'd
[2:42:29] [Music]
[2:42:36] Falling in
[2:42:39] love
[2:42:45] Jesus. Fall in love with Jesus.
[2:42:54] Falling in
[2:42:56] love with
[2:42:59] [Music]
[2:43:01] Jesus was the best thing I
[2:43:05] [Music]
[2:43:11] made. In his
[2:43:14] arms I
[2:43:17] feel protected.
[2:43:21] It is
[2:43:23] all never
[2:43:25] [Music]
[2:43:29] is it
[2:43:32] is for
[2:43:34] our
[2:43:36] [Music]
[2:43:38] protective sound.
[2:43:40] [Applause]
[2:43:41] [Music]
[2:43:47] Falling, falling in
[2:43:50] love with
[2:43:56] Jesus. Falling in
[2:43:59] love with
[2:44:02] [Music]
[2:44:05] Jesus. Falling in
[2:44:07] love with
[2:44:12] Jesus was the best thing I
[2:44:16] [Music]
[2:44:19] ever fall in love.
[2:44:22] Oh, falling in
[2:44:25] love with Jesus.
[2:44:33] Falling in
[2:44:35] love with
[2:44:40] Jesus. Oh, falling in
[2:44:43] love with
[2:44:48] Jesus was
[2:44:50] blessing my name.
[2:44:59] All that I
[2:45:03] spend
[2:45:05] higher
[2:45:10] my release
[2:45:13] my glory takes the
[2:45:17] joy. The more that I can humble myself.
[2:45:27] Lord every day
[2:45:31] I love you.
[2:45:36] [Music]
[2:45:38] The more that I
[2:45:44] surrender
[2:45:52] my glory takes
[2:45:57] control more than I can humble
[2:46:01] myself. Glory lifts me up.
[2:46:06] Every day I feel the
[2:46:12] [Music]
[2:46:13] Lord gets and it gets easier to
[2:46:20] understand the
[2:46:23] storing
[2:46:27] down or wondering.
[2:46:31] I'm standing on solid
[2:46:33] [Music]
[2:46:36] ground to my
[2:46:39] future. And the voice I hear is
[2:46:43] yours. Every day I live. Lord, I love
[2:46:49] you
[2:46:51] more. Lord, I
[2:46:54] surrender. I surrender. Oh my. Why don't
[2:46:57] you lay that
[2:46:59] aside? Lay aside every
[2:47:02] weight. Every besetting sin, lay it
[2:47:06] down. Hallelujah.
[2:47:11] Doubt your
[2:47:12] doubts. Cast off the
[2:47:16] unbeliever. Oh, the more he
[2:47:19] lives

[2:48:17] Oh, the
[2:48:21] more the more he takes
[2:48:26] control and the more that I can humble
[2:48:31] myself, the more he lifts me
[2:48:34] up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you
[2:48:42] [Music]
[2:48:44] more. Yes. The more that I can humble
[2:48:50] myself, the more you lift me up
[2:48:54] every day.
[2:48:57] Oh Lord, I love you more.
[2:49:03] [Music]
[2:49:09] Are you
[2:49:12] washed by the
[2:49:15] water? Oh, washed by the water of the
[2:49:21] word. Oh, are you washed? Washed by the
[2:49:29] water. Oh, washed by the water of the
[2:49:34] word.
[2:49:36] Oh, are you
[2:49:39] washed by the
[2:49:43] water?
[2:49:44] Oh, by the water of the word.
[2:49:50] Oh, you
[2:49:53] are by the
[2:49:56] water. Oh, wash by the waters of the
[2:50:02] world.
[2:50:04] Do you know how it feels not to have one
[2:50:10] guilty feeling? Not to
[2:50:13] [Music]
[2:50:15] wonder. Oh
[2:50:19] yes. Oh yes. Oh, this is what he
[2:50:23] does.

[2:50:32] [Music]
[2:50:35] just to go down in the water for my
[2:50:41] hallelujah.
[2:50:43] Thank you, Lord. It's no impossible.
[2:50:48] How many with me on that?
[2:50:52] Hallelujah.
[2:50:54] When you're washed by the water of the
[2:50:59] word. Oh, are you
[2:51:03] walk by the
[2:51:06] water?
[2:51:08] Oh, by the
[2:51:11] water.
[2:51:14] Oh, you wash
[2:51:17] me by the water. Oh, thank you, Father.
[2:51:21] Thank you, Lord.
[2:51:24] The water of the world. It's like me.
[2:51:28] It's like
[2:51:31] me. We all life today.
[2:51:37] [Music]
[2:51:39] Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:51:41] glory for glory to the Lord. You just
[2:51:46] started your existence.
[2:51:50] [Music]
[2:51:51] There never was no
[2:51:55] sin. Oh God looks your way. He no longer
[2:52:01] sees a sinner.
[2:52:04] Hallelujah.
[2:52:05] [Music]
[2:52:07] Oh that's what he does. He's not by
[2:52:11] anything but by the blood.
[2:52:16] Yes sir.
[2:52:20] by the water of the world.
[2:52:24] Oh, you
[2:52:27] are by the
[2:52:30] water. Hallelujah.
[2:52:34] Hallelujah. Glory, glory,
[2:52:37] glory. Oh, you
[2:52:41] are. Oh, by the water.
[2:52:45] Oh, I'm washed by the water of the
[2:52:54] word. Yes, I'm
[2:52:57] wash by the
[2:53:00] water by the water of the
[2:53:04] word.
[2:53:06] Oh, you wash yourself.
[2:53:13] I am washed by the water of the word.
[2:53:23] I tell you, we've got witnesses
[2:53:26] throughout this building. Hallelujah. Of
[2:53:29] what the washing of the water will do.
[2:53:34] His word became blood for you and I.
[2:53:39] That blood was shed in order to wash you
[2:53:41] and I in.
[2:53:43] And it is a blood that brings a perfect
[2:53:46] loosening from sin.
[2:53:49] It takes the fear and the torment and
[2:53:52] desires out of your life. We've got a
[2:53:56] right to be happy because of what he has
[2:54:00] done for us.
[2:54:03] That's where the joy comes in. The joy
[2:54:06] of the Lord is not out there. It's in
[2:54:07] here.
[2:54:09] That's my strength. I know what he did
[2:54:12] for me. I know where he took me from. I
[2:54:14] know he changed my life. I didn't quit
[2:54:16] anything. He came in. He's the one that
[2:54:18] quit it. Don't look at yourself. Look to
[2:54:21] him.
[2:54:22] [Applause]
[2:54:23] Hallelujah. Are you washed by the water
[2:54:26] of the word? What do I have to do? Just
[2:54:27] stand in it. Stand in it. Stand in it.
[2:54:30] Let it wash you.
[2:54:32] Hallelujah.
[2:54:33] There's no cleansing and a septic bath
[2:54:38] like the bleach of God's blood. Let me
[2:54:41] tell you what, when sin is confessed,
[2:54:43] what it does, it hits that blood and
[2:54:47] that blood begins to go in there like
[2:54:49] bleach does and it takes and begins to
[2:54:51] separate the proteins and everything
[2:54:53] like bleach does, but it separates the
[2:54:55] sin. And what it is doing is it's
[2:54:58] pulling it away from where it once ruled
[2:54:59] over your life. You thought that was
[2:55:01] you. It was not you. It was the spirit
[2:55:04] of that old nature you were under. And
[2:55:06] the blood of Jesus Christ has brought
[2:55:08] the discernment in your life that I am a
[2:55:11] son and daughter of God. And you have
[2:55:12] repented of your sins. And the blood was
[2:55:15] right there to cleanse you. You know
[2:55:18] what it does? It lifts things out of
[2:55:20] your life.
[2:55:22] How many witnesses right here? There's
[2:55:24] in signs all through this building of
[2:55:27] what the blood of Jesus Christ will do.
[2:55:29] It lifts not only the sin, but it lifts
[2:55:32] the guilt. It lifts the desire.
[2:55:35] And you know what it does? It sends it
[2:55:37] back on the one where it started in the
[2:55:40] beginning. The devil's got a lot to
[2:55:42] answer for.
[2:55:45] But while he while all that's being
[2:55:47] piled on him, I don't mind enjoying the
[2:55:51] blessings of the Lord.
[2:55:54] Hallelujah. I don't mind enjoying that.
[2:55:59] And I tell you, don't let anything stand
[2:56:02] in your way. Amen. From full liberty,
[2:56:06] because what God has spoke here this
[2:56:07] morning, it belongs to you. Yes. Amen.
[2:56:11] Oh, sure. I I love getting in his
[2:56:13] presence. Yeah. I get excited. But I
[2:56:15] just want to tell you, excitement is not
[2:56:17] what you stand on.
[2:56:20] Stand on his word. And don't worry.
[2:56:22] That's why when you stand on his word,
[2:56:24] there might be times when you feel down.
[2:56:27] It don't change who you are. Then
[2:56:29] there'll be times when you're soaring up
[2:56:30] here. That didn't change who you were.
[2:56:32] You were there the whole time. And you
[2:56:34] know what God shows you during those
[2:56:36] times? Don't despise the valleys. You
[2:56:38] know what God proves to in the valleys?
[2:56:39] He proves to you who you are. He lets
[2:56:42] you know that there's something greater
[2:56:44] holding you.
[2:56:46] [Music]
[2:56:47] You might be standing here this morning
[2:56:49] say, "But Samuel, I've just really made
[2:56:51] a commitment. I've just surrendered to
[2:56:52] God. But you couldn't get away from God
[2:56:54] even before you made that surrender. You
[2:56:56] know why? You belong to him. This word
[2:56:59] will not let you get away. It's the word
[2:57:01] that's laying claim on your life.
[2:57:04] It's not the spirit of Satan. It's not
[2:57:06] Lady Osia. He don't have a claim on my
[2:57:09] life. My life is claimed by Christ.
[2:57:13] I am my beloved and he is mine. His
[2:57:16] banner over me is love.
[2:57:18] And he had brought me to his banqueting
[2:57:20] table.
[2:57:23] Amen. Where the oil and the new wine is.
[2:57:26] Oh my. It's a feast. And you know where
[2:57:29] it's at? He's prepared this feast in the
[2:57:31] presence of my
[2:57:33] enemies. Right. Every
[2:57:37] day. This guy don't feel like going, but
[2:57:40] this guy on the inside says, "Get your
[2:57:41] tie on, buddy." This guy says, "I
[2:57:44] resign." The guy on the inside says,
[2:57:46] "Get your mic on and get out there."
[2:57:49] Hallelujah. Greater is he that is in me.
[2:57:52] You say, "Why did God let this happen?"
[2:57:54] He's proven to you there's something
[2:57:57] greater on the inside.
[2:58:01] Glory to God. And the spirit of
[2:58:03] discernment reveals that to you. It's
[2:58:06] not you holding on to God. It's God
[2:58:07] holding you.
[2:58:09] Hallelujah.
[2:58:11] Oh, the devil don't like no
[2:58:15] around here. You know
[2:58:16] [Music]
[2:58:21] it. Come on,
[2:58:24] [Music]
[2:58:31] Paul. Don't like no praising God around

[2:58:40] shouting around here. Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:58:44] the devil don't like no shouting around
[2:58:49] here. Oh, but I don't care what the
[2:58:53] devil don't like. I'm going to shout
[2:58:56] with all my life. I don't care what the
[2:58:59] devil don't like around here.
[2:59:02] Hallelujah. Oh, the devil don't like no
[2:59:06] singing around here.

[2:59:14] around

[2:59:20] doesn't like. I'm going to sing with all
[2:59:23] my mind. I don't care what the devil
[2:59:26] don't like around
[2:59:29] you. Oh, the devil don't like me
[2:59:33] praising God. Oh, yes. Oh, we've got a
[2:59:36] right to praise. Oh, the devil doesn't
[2:59:39] like me praising God around here.
[2:59:42] Hallelujah.

[3:00:21] devil. Oh yes. Oh, the devil doesn't
[3:00:26] like me worshiping God around here.
[3:00:30] Oh, that devil don't want just
[3:00:33] worshiping God around
[3:00:36] here. Oh, but we don't care what the
[3:00:40] devil doesn't like. We're going to
[3:00:42] worship our God tonight. We don't care
[3:00:46] what the devil like around here. Oh yes.
[3:00:51] Well, the devil doesn't like me praising
[3:00:54] God around
[3:00:56] here. Oh, that devil doesn't like me
[3:01:00] praising God around here.
[3:01:04] Well, well, we don't care what the devil
[3:01:07] does tonight. We're going to worship
[3:01:10] with all of our might. We don't care

[3:01:15] don't. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, the devil
[3:01:19] doesn't like no liberty around

[3:01:28] liberty around here. Oh, that's right.
[3:01:30] He don't like liberty.
[3:01:32] But I don't care what the devil's about.

[3:01:39] here. Oh
