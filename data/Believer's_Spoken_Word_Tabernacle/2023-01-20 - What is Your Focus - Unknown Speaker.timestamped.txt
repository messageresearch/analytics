[35:16] I'm glad we're on the right path
[35:19] and God for the evening light that's
[35:20] come
[35:22] amen it takes the guesswork out the
[35:25] obscurity and
[35:26] I'm just grateful to be on the right
[35:28] path
[35:29] amen we we have a sure Foundation
[35:33] sure destiny
[35:35] man we don't know what everything holds
[35:38] between this point and that point but
[35:40] one thing we know
[35:42] we're going back home
[35:45] God told Moses when he made himself
[35:48] known to Moses
[35:50] the place of the revealing would also be
[35:53] the place of ending
[35:55] God let him know I'm going to bring you
[35:57] back to this mountain
[35:59] and you're going to worship me here and
[36:00] so
[36:02] everything between when they went down
[36:04] to when Egypt when he went down to Egypt
[36:06] and then they're coming back here to
[36:08] that place think about it Moses had to
[36:11] be reminded of his commission reminded
[36:13] that God said I'll bring you right back
[36:14] here
[36:16] and so when it came to the Red Sea speak
[36:18] that they go forward
[36:20] so between here and there there is
[36:23] nothing that's going to stop God's word
[36:25] from being fulfilled
[36:27] what he promised we're going back home
[36:31] there'll be some mountains we've got to
[36:33] speak to there'll be some situations
[36:35] we've got to speak to some direction we
[36:38] have to take but in it all
[36:40] we've got a clear path aren't you aren't
[36:41] you thankful tonight amen that's that's
[36:44] a real rest amen for our hearts so good

[37:45] the word of the Lord let's we'll read
[37:46] and then we'll just ask the Lord's
[37:48] blessing upon the word
[37:50] verse 27 and job 21.
[37:53] job speaking to his his friends he says
[37:57] behold I know your thoughts and the
[38:00] devices which he wrongfully imagine
[38:02] against me and it really wasn't too hard
[38:05] to figure out what they thought they'd
[38:07] been saying the same thing all along
[38:10] that you're guilty you're something that
[38:13] you're between secret between you and
[38:15] God see it wasn't anything that they
[38:17] could come out and point and put and say
[38:19] well you did this over here and you did
[38:21] this they couldn't do that
[38:23] what they were trying to do is accuse
[38:25] him
[38:26] of something inwardly Secret
[38:29] boy we could just preach on that for
[38:32] we can't go there tonight but what job
[38:35] knew and what was most important and
[38:36] what's important for us is we know
[38:38] inwardly
[38:40] but you know what there's nothing
[38:42] between God and I
[38:45] there's nothing that I've kept back I've
[38:46] not kept back one thing from God
[38:48] anything that God has led me to do I've
[38:50] done it I've not held back one thing and
[38:52] we can stand there like Joel
[38:55] amen job 27 once again behold I know
[38:58] your thoughts on the devices which he
[39:00] wrongfully imagined against me let's
[39:04] pray heavenly father as we lord look to
[39:08] you this evening and oh God we we need
[39:12] you Lord Jesus
[39:14] you are our source of strength you are
[39:16] life
[39:18] Lord we want to say thank you I know
[39:20] that we each have done that individually
[39:23] for the services this past weekend
[39:26] thank you for the grace through this
[39:28] week thus far Lord
[39:30] oh God it's just always so precious Lord
[39:34] the enrichment spiritually of Our Lives
[39:37] Lord from coming into your presence just
[39:40] nothing like it Lord of what you're able
[39:42] to do in just a few moments of Time Lord
[39:45] so we ask that you'll help us here
[39:47] tonight Lord speaker and here together
[39:49] to step aside for just a few moments
[39:52] Lord and that you would speak Lord what
[39:55] it is Lord that you desire to say Lord
[39:58] we reserve ourselves Lord speaker and
[40:00] here together to the leading of the Holy
[40:03] Spirit may you have your way in and all
[40:05] things be glorified in Jesus name amen
[40:08] God bless you as you're being seated I'd
[40:11] like to continue to read there
[40:14] would allow me to
[40:16] upon that
[40:18] for you say where is the house of The
[40:23] Prince and where are The Dwelling Places
[40:26] of the wicked
[40:28] have you not asked them that go by the
[40:30] way
[40:31] and do you not know their tokens in
[40:34] other words what job's saying is have
[40:37] you not asked those who travel this way
[40:39] and do you not accept their testimony
[40:41] and evidences that the wicked is
[40:45] reserved
[40:47] to the day of Destruction
[40:49] they shall be brought forth to the day
[40:52] of Wrath
[40:54] so
[40:56] what's job is remember he's answering
[40:58] the accusations that have continued to
[41:01] go through
[41:03] out and in chapter 20 it was just an
[41:06] all-out onslaught
[41:07] and this is part of the trial
[41:10] this is part of the test
[41:12] God permits in a test and a trial just
[41:14] was listening to the prophet once again
[41:16] a message some of the messages have been
[41:18] just been going through over these past
[41:19] months just the message titled job and
[41:22] brother Brown you'd be familiar with
[41:23] this out of the scriptures
[41:26] how that God will permit even as we are
[41:31] beginning in serving the lord God will
[41:34] permit a trial to strike in he'll permit
[41:36] something to come our way
[41:38] and that's all part of a trying I I can
[41:41] go back I could give you know personal
[41:43] examples of things and and it isn't
[41:45] always things that you know that would
[41:47] be as simple as just stepping across the
[41:49] line like a crack in the sidewalk or a
[41:52] hole but so it's things that has a I
[41:55] would have a meaning or have pull or
[41:58] have draw or have something there and
[42:00] God permits that to come or something
[42:03] and the whole objective is that when
[42:05] that comes if we're just hold to him who
[42:09] has begun the work in our life you'll
[42:12] bring us through that and we'll find Our
[42:15] Lives we're stronger to keep on moving
[42:17] on with him the pressing it's not about
[42:21] human strength it's not our human
[42:22] strength it's saying Lord I need your
[42:25] strength and just keeping our eyes upon
[42:27] him
[42:28] and I want I'll get to my title here in
[42:30] a moment but I want you to look here in
[42:32] verse 30 once again the wicked is
[42:34] reserved to the day of Destruction and
[42:37] they shall be brought forth to the day
[42:38] of Wrath so as they were saying in
[42:40] previous chapters that
[42:42] this right here the a swift removal of
[42:46] everything all around you that that
[42:48] implies that you're a secret sinner
[42:50] you're a wicked and they're trying to
[42:52] place job there but job knows where he's
[42:54] standing with God and it was a wrong
[42:57] application of the word and let me just
[42:59] say this right here even wrong
[43:01] interpretations of the word can never
[43:03] dismantle the Seal of the Living God
[43:06] the Seal of the Living God standeth a
[43:10] sure the Lord knoweth them that are his
[43:14] you had the workers like hymenus and
[43:16] felitis and they were you know cutting
[43:18] and pasting quotes and doing everything
[43:20] else and they had Paul saying something
[43:22] and you know in such a manner that when
[43:24] they got done some of the people's Faith
[43:27] were overthrown but there were those
[43:29] that though they could say I don't know
[43:31] exactly all that is being said but I
[43:33] know where I'm standing and I'm not
[43:34] going to follow you I'll just stay right
[43:36] here and I'll wait until God makes it
[43:38] known
[43:39] and when God makes it known that's when
[43:40] I have need of it and until that time
[43:42] I'm not going to try to figure it out
[43:43] neither am I going to pick up your
[43:45] interpretation of it
[43:48] glory be to Cotton eyes we could preach
[43:50] on that for a minute but notice the
[43:53] reserve they are reserved the wicked is
[43:55] being prepared for the burning
[43:58] you're being molded through the fiery
[44:00] trials you and me are being molded
[44:02] through the fiery trials right now for
[44:04] the glory that's to be revealed in US
[44:06] amen and who now this in verse 31 who
[44:09] shall declare his way to his face in
[44:11] other words to The Wicked who's going to
[44:12] declare his way to his face and who's
[44:15] and who shall repay him what he have
[44:16] done yet he shall be brought to the
[44:19] grave and shall remain in the Tomb the
[44:22] clouds of the valley shall be sweet unto
[44:24] him and every man shall draw after him
[44:26] as there are innumerably before him how
[44:29] then Comfort ye me in vain seeing in
[44:31] your answers that remaineth falsehood
[44:33] and remember here they are trying to
[44:35] comfort him they're trying to bring
[44:36] Direction but job by the discernment of
[44:40] the word in his life he knows where he's
[44:42] standing and he's able to say this is
[44:44] falsehood it's not where I'm standing
[44:47] with God my fellowship with God is
[44:51] uninterrupted because the only thing
[44:53] that'll interrupt Fellowship is sin
[44:56] right but once sin is confessed
[44:59] Fellowship is restored
[45:02] just like that we go through examples on
[45:04] the prayer line so there are multiple
[45:06] preparations that are going on even in
[45:10] this moment and have been the bride is
[45:14] preparing for rapture
[45:16] is that right the foolish virgin is
[45:19] preparing for the tribulation you can
[45:21] think well how is the foolish virgin
[45:22] preparing for the tribulation she's
[45:25] preparing for it by failing to prepare
[45:28] what's needed for rapture
[45:31] dilatory letting her light go out
[45:35] so that's how she's making preparation
[45:37] and then we have as well as the church
[45:40] and things like that and those that'll
[45:41] make their decisions in the tribulation
[45:43] and the wicked is also preparing for
[45:46] Destruction so everybody's in a season
[45:48] of preparation is that right and so I
[45:51] want to just speak tonight on on that
[45:54] that that that question what is your
[45:57] focus
[46:00] what is your focus because it's not
[46:03] something that I can answer it's only
[46:05] what you can answer I can only answer
[46:07] that question for myself and if I can
[46:09] just say it in this manner
[46:11] is that when we look so much at what I
[46:13] don't want you to all all just to focus
[46:16] on what as being like an inanimate
[46:19] object or just something that's just
[46:20] like like the speaker or something you
[46:23] know just like a plan but remember when
[46:26] God speaks to the mountain that is
[46:29] before the opposition when they came
[46:32] back in the land to build the temple
[46:35] there was a lot of things that were
[46:37] working to distract their focus but it
[46:40] all came down to one thing who art thou
[46:44] old great Mountain because behind every
[46:48] what is a who so if we can let the word
[46:52] uncover it will it will reveal the who
[46:56] and let me tell you whatever the what is
[46:59] if the wrong who is behind it we want to
[47:01] get away from it
[47:03] right if either it's influenced by God
[47:06] and God's directing it or it's the enemy
[47:09] we want to let the word uncover it and
[47:12] really put that and say what is my focus
[47:16] so what are we focused on here so within
[47:19] that because we've seen where job's
[47:21] friends Joe's friends are only focused
[47:23] on the temporal things and there's other
[47:24] in in in in preceding chapters where
[47:27] they're you know letting him know if you
[47:28] get right with God and and if you
[47:30] confess your sins oh the silver and the
[47:32] gold will start flowing back into your
[47:34] house Joe didn't care about that
[47:38] he didn't care about that what Joe
[47:40] mattered to Joe was is that I'm used to
[47:43] talking to him and hearing from him and
[47:46] I don't care if I don't have two nickels
[47:48] to rub together I want to hear from him
[47:51] because I can't make sense of all this
[47:54] right here and what has happened is not
[47:56] my focus job your children is not your
[47:59] focus not my focus your cattle's not
[48:01] your focus nope not my focus your
[48:03] money's not your focus no not my focus
[48:06] because God hath given the lord giveth
[48:09] and the lord taketh away blessed be the
[48:12] name of the Lord I I don't want to focus
[48:15] on it because I don't understand but I
[48:18] want fellowship with him
[48:20] he had fellowship with God Joe could
[48:23] look at his life and know there was no
[48:25] hidden or secret sin and it was he was
[48:27] remember he's in a place of he's
[48:29] confused why am I not hearing from him
[48:31] well why is there not you know uh
[48:33] Direction being made or sense being
[48:36] given to this
[48:38] so when we look at Proverbs 11 23.
[48:43] the Bible says the desire and I want you
[48:45] to watch these words
[48:46] the desire
[48:49] of the righteous is only good that's a
[48:51] that's inward
[48:53] but the expectation of the wicked is
[48:57] wrathful the only hope
[48:59] of the wicked
[49:01] is Wrath
[49:03] and I want to just just take that just
[49:05] for a moment because when we take that
[49:07] word Focus you know how many times
[49:08] you've had people take focus focus focus
[49:12] you know sometimes you could be talking
[49:13] to your kids you're like Focus I'm in
[49:14] there like I'm look at man I'm looking
[49:15] I'm looking right at you you know my
[49:17] eyes all eyes and you're like go on
[49:18] Focus I mean you can tell when you know
[49:20] things are you know like Charlie Brown's
[49:22] teacher
[49:23] you feel that way as a parent
[49:26] right
[49:28] so we understand Focus what we're trying
[49:31] to say is give me your undivided
[49:33] attention and your mind don't be looking
[49:36] at me saying uh-huh mama and thinking
[49:38] about your clothes in the washer
[49:40] right we understand that right so notice
[49:44] I mean because you know nobody you would
[49:46] like to be able to ask the surgeon
[49:48] before you go in for surgery what are
[49:49] you thinking about today oh I tell you
[49:52] my car my Mercedes broke down and this
[49:55] and that of course those little things
[49:56] won't matter too much to a surgeon you
[49:57] know they got the money to put it up in
[49:59] no time but you know you just want to
[50:00] ask him hey was your coffee good this
[50:01] morning
[50:03] even when I go fix you a good cup
[50:05] right you want to make sure they're
[50:07] they're lined up just right
[50:09] right
[50:10] I don't want you to start
[50:13] I want you to be delicate
[50:17] so Focus
[50:19] to focus something is to have a central
[50:22] point
[50:23] that we're looking at and where all of
[50:26] our attention
[50:27] is pointed into or the activity it's
[50:30] where things are focused into
[50:32] and so just to say that God has always
[50:36] set his word
[50:37] to be the object of focus
[50:41] God has always done that he did it in
[50:43] Eden he's all the way to God has set his
[50:46] word to be the focus
[50:49] and through a life focusing in upon his
[50:53] word now remember I'm not talking about
[50:55] a letter yet the Living Word will always
[50:58] be the expression of the letter and the
[51:01] Living Word will never take away from
[51:04] the letter
[51:05] is that right just like a tomato plant
[51:07] comes up you've got all the writings on
[51:09] the back of the packet that describes
[51:11] the things that you're seeing that's the
[51:13] way the word of God describes when
[51:16] Christ is being made manifest and we
[51:18] recognize by the grace of God so God has
[51:21] always said his word to be the focus and
[51:23] when a life
[51:25] can be caught away from all of the cares
[51:29] and the distractions and the and the
[51:31] busyness and sometimes it's not just the
[51:33] external things sometimes it's the
[51:36] warring even within our own members but
[51:39] when that life can focus on him and
[51:42] focus on the word then there comes forth
[51:45] a relationship then there becomes a
[51:47] fellowship then there's a strengthening
[51:49] that a man will receive man or woman in
[51:52] his life that will will equip him to
[51:55] navigate through the Troublesome to melt
[51:58] tumultuous times of life as well as the
[52:01] pleasant times of life as well and so
[52:04] that Focus has always been upon him and
[52:06] and he's the word and God his presence
[52:09] God's presence will arise like like it
[52:12] has here in in this in this time you
[52:15] know this time is is very much described
[52:18] even as it was in the first coming of
[52:20] the Lord Jesus where it speaks of a
[52:22] great light shall arise and those who
[52:24] said in darkness are great light is
[52:26] sprung up God the light of his word of
[52:28] his presence has sprung up but what is
[52:30] it it's God fulfilling his word making
[52:33] his word to live just like take the
[52:35] example of the woman at the well the
[52:37] word begins to shine floor she doesn't
[52:40] understand everything but in the
[52:43] presence of the word what's what's
[52:44] happening there there's a connection
[52:46] taking place our fathers say this and
[52:49] she begins to go through things what's
[52:51] that her life is is it's now being
[52:53] opened by the presence of the word in
[52:57] right there and there's a relate there's
[52:59] a relationship there's that which is
[53:01] beginning to unfold and what God is
[53:03] doing is drawing out of that life that's
[53:07] been so clouded over with hurts and you
[53:11] know Daddy didn't care about me and Mama
[53:14] didn't care about me and all those
[53:16] things that was there that have been
[53:18] packed in our life and the word is
[53:20] drawing her by the supernatural presence
[53:23] of God is coming to a place to where now
[53:26] through the surrender of her life the
[53:29] invisible God will make himself known
[53:33] through her life
[53:35] I want you to think about this the
[53:37] prophets themselves were reflectors
[53:41] I don't know about you but I thought
[53:43] about like when I came in down here
[53:44] tonight man it's in the dark it's hard
[53:47] to see to turn in on that far driveway
[53:49] you know brother Sammy you're getting it
[53:52] I'm not that old yet
[53:54] but man it was hard for me to see to
[53:55] turn in but then you know as you come
[53:57] down thank goodness you know where the
[53:59] brothers they put up those reflective
[54:01] things to kind of Bend us around but a
[54:03] reflection a reflector is meant with
[54:06] properties to reflect the light so we
[54:08] can see
[54:10] the prophets were reflectors they were
[54:13] built by God that way ordained by God
[54:17] like God told Jeremiah I've ordained you
[54:19] to be a prophet before you were in your
[54:21] mother's womb
[54:23] and just as the prophets were ordained
[54:26] to be reflectors we as believers
[54:30] are ordained to be reflectors
[54:33] we are to be reflectors of his glory
[54:36] because everybody in our house and
[54:39] everyone in our family and our
[54:41] co-workers and everyone around us not
[54:43] everyone
[54:44] has received that glory in their life
[54:48] and don't know what makes you tick and
[54:51] what makes you act the way you do it
[54:53] what makes you make decisions the way
[54:55] you do but you don't have to explain all
[54:57] that you have to just let the glory be
[55:00] revealed
[55:02] because that's what's getting the
[55:04] tension is the glory being revealed it's
[55:07] a pathway hey there's a surety there's
[55:09] something different about this man or
[55:10] woman they don't just talk it and it's
[55:12] just not a religious practice there's
[55:15] something different about them
[55:17] Christ is their life
[55:20] he says not a part of one day out of the
[55:23] week or two days out of the week out of
[55:24] a social Affair no he's their life
[55:27] it's a reflection
[55:30] so what is our Focus Psalms 37 34.
[55:36] we read something out of this chapter
[55:37] the last week but I want to just move
[55:39] back in
[55:40] wait on the Lord
[55:45] and keep his way
[55:47] how do you keep the way of the Lord
[55:49] is it
[55:51] where we just sat down with a word and
[55:53] we're reciting the word or well the word
[55:55] said do this and so I'm going to do that
[55:57] in one way yes
[55:59] but the real way that we keep his way
[56:02] is that his life is in US
[56:06] that's how we keep his way
[56:08] that's how we keep it is where it's no
[56:10] longer where us and the book are
[56:13] separate but now we are one
[56:16] these shall no longer be Twain but
[56:18] they're one
[56:19] right
[56:20] so that's how we keep his way by
[56:22] allowing the word wait on the Lord Lord
[56:24] how do I waiting on you allowing the
[56:27] word to saturate down into our life
[56:29] allowing it to break out all the
[56:32] greenness in our life we're we're not
[56:34] here in a holding pattern and saying
[56:38] I wish so-and-so would hurry up and come
[56:40] in because I want to go in a rapture we
[56:42] are waiting not on the last one to come
[56:45] into this church
[56:47] they might already be here
[56:49] we're waiting on them to get baptized
[56:52] into the body of Jesus Christ by the
[56:55] Holy Ghost but my waiting is on the Lord
[56:58] because God is still working in my life
[57:02] as well
[57:05] I've often pondered that thought this
[57:07] isn't this is my thoughts and I'm not
[57:09] preaching my thoughts but I've often
[57:10] wondered about even with that statement
[57:12] where does that also lie with maturity
[57:14] as well within that life you know it's
[57:16] just that the the ways of the Lord are
[57:18] beyond our mind of finding out to me
[57:21] I'll just say it like this if it's
[57:23] another 10 years I'm going to enjoy in
[57:26] Jesus
[57:27] the world will get worse that's true but
[57:29] I'm not going to get disheartened I'm
[57:32] not going to throw away my experience
[57:33] because
[57:34] 1977 wasn't something I made something
[57:37] say
[57:39] the prophet never said that men made
[57:41] that say that way
[57:44] come on Friends
[57:46] you know my expectation is of the Lord
[57:49] let me just put it simple the coming of
[57:51] the Lord is what I expect I expect him
[57:54] to come in this service I expect him if
[57:57] he tarries tonight expecting to come in
[58:00] the morning and guide me through the day
[58:01] I'm expecting the coming of the Lord
[58:04] that's why the Rapture the prophet said
[58:07] it will not be a hard thing for the
[58:10] Church of the Living God why because for
[58:13] Enoch just another day as a believer
[58:17] keep his way and he shall exalt thee to
[58:21] inherit the land when the wicked are cut
[58:24] off
[58:25] Thou shalt see it so that's why you know
[58:29] we're not under an anointing to get
[58:30] picket signs and we don't agree with
[58:32] abortion but we're not under the
[58:33] anointing and to go out there and
[58:35] protest this and protest that we are not
[58:37] under that anointing we are under the
[58:40] anointing of rapture
[58:43] the wicked is going to go on and
[58:45] continue to do wickedly
[58:46] the main thing is is that where you
[58:48] stand you stand and I stand in
[58:51] where can we say as for me and my house
[58:54] we will serve the Lord I don't have no
[58:57] effect on anybody else I can't even
[58:59] affect the house across the street but
[59:01] as for me and my house let me tell you
[59:04] where we're going to stand we are going
[59:06] to serve the Lord
[59:10] verse 35. I have seen the wicked in
[59:14] great power
[59:15] and spreading himself
[59:17] like
[59:19] a Green Bay Tree
[59:23] like not that he is because a Green Bay
[59:27] Tree is one of those
[59:29] it's one of the
[59:30] five types of trees that would be
[59:33] mentioned in the scripture that are very
[59:34] can be a very precious tree but it's
[59:37] just like remember when lot looked upon
[59:39] Sodom he saw the planes and it was even
[59:42] as
[59:43] The Garden of God he didn't say it was
[59:46] I don't want look-alikes
[59:49] I told you before I had a guy coming
[59:51] through the neighborhood when we first
[59:52] built our house the other house we lived
[59:54] in and he pulled up in this hatchback
[59:56] trunk and things like that and he was
[59:57] going to sell me Thomas Kincaid
[59:59] paintings but your car don't match what
[1:00:01] you're selling
[1:00:03] I mean come on we've been to Christian
[1:00:04] bookstores you know Thomas Kincaid you
[1:00:07] know you know what it is getting a
[1:00:08] mortgage document out and let's buy it
[1:00:10] what was he selling knockoffs I'm asking
[1:00:13] how much you want for him 50 bucks these
[1:00:15] are knockoffs buddy I I wasn't born
[1:00:17] yesterday
[1:00:19] and your car don't match what you're
[1:00:20] selling
[1:00:21] nothing wrong with your car but you
[1:00:23] understand what I'm saying it was light
[1:00:25] but it wasn't the real thing
[1:00:28] and God ain't coming back after a church
[1:00:30] that's like what he said he's coming
[1:00:33] back after a bride that is what he said
[1:00:40] because that like a green beige oh my
[1:00:42] what a what a what a beautiful thing
[1:00:44] within that but I want to just go on for
[1:00:46] a sake of time in verse 36 yet talking
[1:00:50] of the wicked he passed away
[1:00:53] and lo he was not
[1:00:55] yea I sought him but he could not be
[1:01:00] found
[1:01:01] so he but somebody or something or
[1:01:05] whatever in this life but the wicked I
[1:01:07] couldn't find him I looked around after
[1:01:09] after all that was done here this I
[1:01:12] couldn't find them
[1:01:13] remember brother Brown talks about how
[1:01:15] that you'd go over to Egypt and you'd
[1:01:17] have to dig down
[1:01:19] to get to those pyramids remember that's
[1:01:21] how the pyramids are even exposed
[1:01:22] they've had to dig down
[1:01:24] right
[1:01:25] but all Moses
[1:01:27] how that that life that surrendered to
[1:01:29] God that name goes on
[1:01:33] look at this this is where I really want
[1:01:35] to draw
[1:01:36] from in 37 37 37. mark
[1:01:41] the perfect man
[1:01:42] and behold the upright for the end of
[1:01:44] that
[1:01:46] and then he knows God always has
[1:01:48] Witnesses still
[1:01:49] God's got to witness and no matter what
[1:01:52] it is that a person could be fit God's
[1:01:54] got a witness to say there's overcoming
[1:01:56] Grace for that
[1:01:58] I'm an overcomer
[1:02:01] well brother Sammy I deal with this
[1:02:02] there's overcoming Grace for that it's
[1:02:04] not it's not me it's not me better than
[1:02:06] you it's nobody bad there is over I'm
[1:02:09] as a witness to tell you I once was
[1:02:11] pound but I'm free
[1:02:14] this overcoming Grace God has got a
[1:02:18] witness
[1:02:20] he's got testimonies of his glory
[1:02:24] trophies of his unmerited grace where
[1:02:27] his life reflects to be the same
[1:02:30] yesterday today and forever
[1:02:32] verse 38 but the transgressors shall be
[1:02:35] destroyed together the end of the wicked
[1:02:38] shall be cut off
[1:02:39] oh I like this in verse 39 will you read
[1:02:42] this with me
[1:02:43] but the salvation of the righteous is of
[1:02:47] the Lord
[1:02:48] he is their strength in the time of
[1:02:52] trouble
[1:02:53] let me just say thank you Lord
[1:02:57] salvation and he didn't say you'll have
[1:03:00] a picnic the rest of the way you serve
[1:03:03] me everything will just be smooth and
[1:03:05] peachy and creamy and sprinkles on top
[1:03:08] and powdered sugar everywhere no there's
[1:03:10] gonna be trouble but I will be your
[1:03:13] strength
[1:03:14] [Applause]
[1:03:16] I will be your sufficient grace through
[1:03:20] it all
[1:03:21] read verse 40 with me will you
[1:03:24] and the Lord shall help them and deliver
[1:03:28] them he shall deliver them from the
[1:03:32] wicked and save them because they trust
[1:03:36] in him
[1:03:39] and there's no doubt there's testimonies
[1:03:40] all through this right here of
[1:03:43] situations and not that we are
[1:03:44] classifying because God can always turn
[1:03:47] a life around remember Bert brother
[1:03:49] Branham went hunting with Burton Bert
[1:03:51] seemed to be like wow this guy man this
[1:03:53] guy is cold crew remember the brand
[1:03:55] described him how he was but you see God
[1:03:58] began to move upon Bert's heart
[1:04:01] right brother Branham did not take Bert
[1:04:04] through five changes to be a better bird
[1:04:08] By Ernie God didn't do it that way
[1:04:12] God knew what it was an example
[1:04:15] brother random hands standing on the
[1:04:17] word and if you ask brother Branham
[1:04:19] let's just take into the conversation if
[1:04:21] you'll take about the conversation for a
[1:04:23] moment in as far as humanly naturally
[1:04:26] carnally it didn't seem like there was
[1:04:29] anything going for birth but God knew
[1:04:32] what was down inside a bird he just
[1:04:35] needed the prophet to be a witness and
[1:04:39] pray for his soul
[1:04:44] hmm
[1:04:47] now let's get back into our scripture 37
[1:04:49] there
[1:04:50] mark the perfect man
[1:04:54] and that don't mean go around with a
[1:04:55] spray paint can and spray them
[1:04:58] and behold the upper
[1:05:00] for the end of that
[1:05:05] you are and what you are you do have
[1:05:07] people who are influential in your life
[1:05:10] and you have people that you look up to
[1:05:12] I don't care I we I don't worry I've got
[1:05:14] scripture I'm coming to every one of us
[1:05:17] we have certain things of influences and
[1:05:20] things can be even in our life
[1:05:22] certain things sometimes that we can
[1:05:24] look at but this is such a direction for
[1:05:28] the word of God
[1:05:29] they don't like how God God does it all
[1:05:32] together God does not spend his time
[1:05:34] there's things that God has to say don't
[1:05:37] do this and don't do that but God knows
[1:05:40] there is something greater if you can
[1:05:43] just get a vision
[1:05:45] before you of what's real
[1:05:48] then everything that is the Do Not will
[1:05:52] flee
[1:05:53] God is that
[1:05:56] that could be the reality think about it
[1:05:58] when the Holy Spirit great Mama Eagle
[1:06:01] came over the Barnyard as she began to
[1:06:03] hover and begin to scream he began to
[1:06:07] lose sight
[1:06:08] of the chickens that was around him and
[1:06:10] he was still on the ground
[1:06:12] he began to lose sight of her you're
[1:06:14] never this and this is what you are and
[1:06:16] this is what you are you'll always be
[1:06:17] this and this is what you are you look
[1:06:19] strange you're funny you got big feet
[1:06:21] and you know the wings and the beat oh
[1:06:23] you're an odd guy you're an object he
[1:06:25] had heard that the whole time but
[1:06:27] finally there was a voice
[1:06:30] that he couldn't understand but it it
[1:06:32] fit him like a glove it was something
[1:06:34] that began to call to something and
[1:06:37] awaken something on the inside
[1:06:40] it was something that was a true
[1:06:43] positive not something that was trying
[1:06:45] to conform him to make him a chicken but
[1:06:48] it's something that just said this is
[1:06:50] who you really are
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:55] and we get a glimpse of who we really
[1:06:57] are and stay locked in on it sin flees
[1:07:04] every message will strike the intended
[1:07:07] age
[1:07:09] through a yielded vessel
[1:07:11] God's always had to have a vessel that's
[1:07:13] willing to step aside like the Seven
[1:07:15] Stars in the right hand
[1:07:17] remember those stars reflect the
[1:07:20] Brilliance the glory the power the
[1:07:21] authority
[1:07:22] of him of who he is
[1:07:25] and you know Not only would it call the
[1:07:27] reflection of that life Not only would
[1:07:29] it call to the elect in that hour but
[1:07:32] that leadership and I want you to listen
[1:07:33] to this now but that leadership through
[1:07:35] a Vindicated life
[1:07:37] that was consecrated to the word of the
[1:07:40] Lord would be an example
[1:07:43] to the Believers in that hour
[1:07:45] I mean how could you have confidence
[1:07:49] if the what if the vessel that's
[1:07:51] preaching don't live what's being
[1:07:53] preached
[1:07:55] come on now
[1:07:56] that's why I do not accept nonsense of
[1:07:59] well you got to follow what brother
[1:08:01] Brandon said you know in the quotes
[1:08:03] about Christmas but don't that's
[1:08:04] nonsense
[1:08:06] come on now I mean he's not going to be
[1:08:08] a true prophet in the pulpit in the
[1:08:10] Pagan at home
[1:08:12] come on now
[1:08:14] I mean it just don't make sense
[1:08:15] whatsoever but you see within it because
[1:08:19] a message and his messenger one and I'm
[1:08:21] not just talking about I'm doing my all
[1:08:22] the way through there has to be an
[1:08:24] example of that word on display
[1:08:28] because you and I both know it word
[1:08:30] alone will never do it
[1:08:35] when you watch I watch deep caught the
[1:08:37] Deep we're not seeing where we're seeing
[1:08:40] the word these son of man revealed
[1:08:43] through a son of man it's Christ being
[1:08:46] revealed I can follow that
[1:08:49] as far as Theology and words and
[1:08:52] memorizing this scripture and that
[1:08:53] that's been had down through time but
[1:08:56] this is different this is the promise
[1:08:59] coming of the son of man himself
[1:09:03] it's different Mark the man
[1:09:07] Mark that reality Mark that expression
[1:09:11] Mark that husband Mark that Pastor
[1:09:15] Mark that Father Mark that mother Mark
[1:09:18] that wife Mark that brother Mark that
[1:09:21] sister why are we marking him because
[1:09:24] it's Christ being reflected in them it's
[1:09:27] a real example
[1:09:31] are you with me
[1:09:36] so
[1:09:38] this is why Paul would say in First
[1:09:39] Corinthians 4.
[1:09:42] 14.
[1:09:46] I'm not writing these things to shame
[1:09:48] you
[1:09:49] but as my beloved Sons I warn you
[1:09:52] for though you have ten thousand
[1:09:54] instructors
[1:09:55] in Christ
[1:09:57] yet you have not many fathers for in
[1:10:01] Christ Jesus I have begotten you through
[1:10:03] the gospel
[1:10:05] wherefore I beseech you be your
[1:10:08] followers of me
[1:10:10] now this is this principle of following
[1:10:13] is not new
[1:10:15] everybody's following somebody
[1:10:18] you know you've heard the cliche even if
[1:10:19] it's following their own dumb self
[1:10:22] everybody's following somebody
[1:10:25] but what you got to make sure is who
[1:10:28] you're following who are they following
[1:10:32] that's what's important who are they
[1:10:34] following when are they getting their
[1:10:36] influence from that's why your children
[1:10:38] your children are going to look at you
[1:10:39] your life is going to interpret what
[1:10:42] this message is make sure it's a right
[1:10:46] interpretation
[1:10:48] that it's Jesus Christ on display
[1:10:51] I'm talking about you and me being
[1:10:53] perfect nobody in here nobody could be
[1:10:56] perfect in their own flesh but it's his
[1:10:59] life his nature the token on display
[1:11:04] that is the stop for every decision
[1:11:08] right in other words you can't just pass
[1:11:11] Globe go without collecting 200 you got
[1:11:13] to come through
[1:11:14] and let's check it out
[1:11:18] Paul said
[1:11:20] another place boy I wonder if Paul was
[1:11:23] just full of himself
[1:11:25] be your followers of me even as I also
[1:11:29] am of Christ
[1:11:31] you know what Paul what is being said
[1:11:33] because remember there could be many
[1:11:35] instructors but we've got one father
[1:11:38] we've been fathered in the Faith by this
[1:11:42] revealed word it has not produced a
[1:11:44] bunch of branhams
[1:11:46] remember beyond the curtain of time are
[1:11:48] these all branhams no these are your
[1:11:49] converts
[1:11:50] right these are the children of God that
[1:11:54] have been begotten by the spirit and the
[1:11:57] word
[1:11:58] is that right
[1:12:00] so when it's all said and done it's just
[1:12:03] like when it comes down to it
[1:12:07] what brother random had said and you're
[1:12:10] going to take me in the scriptures and
[1:12:11] take me around and come up with the
[1:12:13] different conclusions sorry
[1:12:16] it's like the answer to a math test
[1:12:19] if you get a different answer you're
[1:12:21] going the wrong way
[1:12:23] are you with me God's already given us
[1:12:25] the answers
[1:12:27] and we don't have to try to figure it
[1:12:28] out well I've got to figure this out and
[1:12:29] I've got he is the one to lead us
[1:12:33] oh what a rash that that presents you
[1:12:36] see when we can live within the word and
[1:12:39] the message of the hour to recognize it
[1:12:42] is the rest of the holy spirit that has
[1:12:45] come to you and I it's not for me to
[1:12:47] figure it out it's to surrender and let
[1:12:50] it live itself out
[1:12:53] amen
[1:12:55] so we are affected
[1:12:57] and influenced
[1:13:00] by the invisible God
[1:13:02] remember everybody
[1:13:04] is being affected and influenced from an
[1:13:07] invisible Realm
[1:13:11] I mean you can go down to the jails
[1:13:12] tonight it's not just from jails you can
[1:13:14] go down to people walking right down the
[1:13:16] street seem to be good and you know
[1:13:19] people and everything else but where is
[1:13:21] their influence
[1:13:22] I'm gonna say well how do I know what's
[1:13:24] their steps
[1:13:26] their steps will tell you what they're
[1:13:28] focusing on and when you find out what
[1:13:31] they're focusing on you know who's
[1:13:33] behind the what
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:41] remember
[1:13:43] when brother Brown saw the vision of the
[1:13:45] Brian I want you just to keep this in
[1:13:46] mind for a statement I'll make your Lord
[1:13:48] willing in a bit when he saw the vision
[1:13:50] of the Bride remember the church the
[1:13:51] bride came in preview once that Alpha
[1:13:53] bride then you have the church comes in
[1:13:55] preview and the church is just going off
[1:13:59] going off and what was she following see
[1:14:02] she wasn't just going off by herself
[1:14:05] you with me
[1:14:06] the preview of the what was she
[1:14:08] following
[1:14:09] she was following a witch
[1:14:12] right Paul identified in the book of
[1:14:15] Galatians seducing Spirits also in the
[1:14:18] book of Timothy what are they to do
[1:14:20] what's a seducing Spirit to do get you
[1:14:24] off of the right path
[1:14:28] right
[1:14:29] and notice she's following that it's
[1:14:32] religious in realm and remember she went
[1:14:36] right off
[1:14:37] into judgment
[1:14:39] screaming
[1:14:41] now before I get to that last part of
[1:14:44] the Bride you and I coming into view so
[1:14:47] we're affected and influenced by the
[1:14:49] invisible realm I I believe with all my
[1:14:51] heart that God has I'm being affected by
[1:14:55] the Lord
[1:14:56] how many drunk women say Lord I believe
[1:14:58] I'm being affected by you my life and
[1:15:00] and you know what I I want my life to
[1:15:02] continue to be affected and influenced
[1:15:04] Lord by you I I don't want to get caught
[1:15:06] up in this world matter of fact I'm very
[1:15:08] intentional about that I don't want
[1:15:10] nothing to do with this world
[1:15:12] I don't want nothing to do with there
[1:15:14] let me hand you a curriculum on how to
[1:15:16] be a boy let me hand you and I don't
[1:15:19] want nothing to do with that
[1:15:22] verse 17 of second Corinthians 4 for our
[1:15:26] light of fiction is but for a moment it
[1:15:28] working for us a far more exceeding and
[1:15:30] eternal weight of Glory while we look
[1:15:32] not this is us while we look not at the
[1:15:36] things what you're seeing so he's
[1:15:37] talking about going through tests going
[1:15:39] through trials and we are not going to
[1:15:42] become wrapped up in the afflictions
[1:15:44] because we are walking by the things
[1:15:47] which are not which we're not wrapped up
[1:15:50] in that which is seen But at the things
[1:15:52] which are not seen
[1:15:55] for the things which are seen are
[1:15:57] temporal but the things which are are
[1:15:59] not seen
[1:16:00] are Eternal so I just say it like this
[1:16:03] it's a very
[1:16:04] it's a reality of maintaining the right
[1:16:07] Focus
[1:16:08] parents you know this
[1:16:11] uh
[1:16:12] all of us going down the road nowadays
[1:16:15] you know I mean how many you see videos
[1:16:17] of people at home
[1:16:19] and a text from so and so
[1:16:21] and how many times you see laws are
[1:16:23] passed signs are put up no texting
[1:16:25] driving how many times you see people
[1:16:26] drive by you
[1:16:28] the same way you do slow down and let
[1:16:30] them go
[1:16:32] let them go
[1:16:34] you know what I don't want my car here
[1:16:38] I got insurance but I'm not interested I
[1:16:40] got places to go I don't want to get
[1:16:42] tied up in that and who knows
[1:16:44] right
[1:16:45] but the same mouth thought God does have
[1:16:47] his hand in our life but God also gave
[1:16:48] us a brain between our ears too and
[1:16:50] Common Sense
[1:16:51] is that right
[1:16:54] so it's it maintained the right Focus
[1:16:56] you can have oh my goodness look at this
[1:16:58] over here like my wife will tell me over
[1:17:00] and over you know I'm going by fields
[1:17:03] and I'll be looking at Edge lines and
[1:17:04] things I'd be way out there hundreds of
[1:17:06] yards and things and I just kind of look
[1:17:07] for them keep your eyes on our own honey
[1:17:10] don't be looking for them dear
[1:17:12] come outside oh my goodness look at that
[1:17:14] buck and that's it going to get your
[1:17:15] eyes
[1:17:17] why she didn't that she don't like deer
[1:17:20] she enjoys eating them when they're
[1:17:22] brought home but she wants to get home
[1:17:26] right
[1:17:28] so I got somebody there to say get your
[1:17:30] eyes back on the road
[1:17:32] now do I not know to keep my eyes on the
[1:17:34] road come on that's one-on-one ABCs of
[1:17:36] driving
[1:17:37] right we all know that like Dad I got
[1:17:40] that down
[1:17:41] maintaining the right Focus because the
[1:17:46] bride at the back
[1:17:48] remember she's the bride I want you to
[1:17:50] think about that we're the bride
[1:17:52] but the bride got to looking
[1:17:55] at the way the church was going
[1:17:58] the bride got caught up she was starting
[1:18:00] to look at they're doing this oh they're
[1:18:03] doing this or they're doing this you see
[1:18:05] the more that you watch the church which
[1:18:07] is Nations politics and everything else
[1:18:09] your walk will start deviating towards
[1:18:13] that
[1:18:16] but how did the prophet straighten it
[1:18:17] out he never said I reached over there
[1:18:19] and grabbed their hand and said get back
[1:18:21] in line he said no I had to stay focused
[1:18:23] on the word and then by staying focused
[1:18:25] on the word it'll bring her back in line
[1:18:28] thank God for the holy spirit thank God
[1:18:32] for ordained men thank God for Real
[1:18:34] Husbands wives and fathers and mothers
[1:18:37] let us stay focused on the work that if
[1:18:39] the enemy would try to start going this
[1:18:41] way there's a focus we're not going that
[1:18:43] way this is the way we're going
[1:18:47] and the word will correct the error
[1:18:52] and because she's the bride right back
[1:18:55] instead
[1:18:56] that's the quality
[1:18:58] let's look at Psalm 73 here just for a
[1:19:01] moment
[1:19:02] now
[1:19:03] this is ASAP
[1:19:06] you know just just to I want to just
[1:19:07] interject here just a moment upon this
[1:19:09] this particular thing if we could go
[1:19:11] Psalm 73 verse 2 and uh
[1:19:14] I'll read fast and you follow fast and
[1:19:16] listen
[1:19:17] here's ASAP remember I want you to know
[1:19:19] who ASAP is Asap is one of the
[1:19:22] the lead musicians
[1:19:25] in other words this guy was the one
[1:19:27] who's arranging all the music in the
[1:19:29] song services
[1:19:30] he's the one that's over I'm not making
[1:19:32] that up that's that's ASAP
[1:19:35] but I want you to notice what asaph gets
[1:19:37] to looking at
[1:19:39] and this is his testimony verse two
[1:19:41] but as for me
[1:19:43] my feet
[1:19:45] we're almost gone
[1:19:47] my steps had well and I slipped why for
[1:19:52] I was envious at the foolish when I saw
[1:19:56] the prosperity of the wicked
[1:19:58] Here I Am The Righteous and they're
[1:20:00] getting a promotion at work and they're
[1:20:02] doing this and bless God give me the
[1:20:05] sign I'm gonna go protest against them
[1:20:10] well we're getting down to home cooking
[1:20:12] now aren't we
[1:20:15] see that's a trap what's it doing you're
[1:20:18] becoming vexed
[1:20:20] it's a trial it's a trial instead of
[1:20:23] saying Lord give me strength Lord to
[1:20:26] bring out of me I don't want because
[1:20:27] they're springing through other things
[1:20:28] out of me it's bringing the Old Samuel
[1:20:30] out it's bringing the old bill out and I
[1:20:32] don't want the old Bill coming out I
[1:20:34] don't want the old Brian coming out I
[1:20:36] don't want the old Shane coming out
[1:20:39] I don't want that
[1:20:43] for I was envious at the foolish when I
[1:20:45] saw the prosperity of the wicked in
[1:20:48] other words just coming down and all of
[1:20:50] a sudden we'd revert back in almost like
[1:20:52] that child it ain't Fair
[1:20:55] I mean there's a lot of things that's
[1:20:57] not fair
[1:20:59] for there are no bands in their death
[1:21:01] but their strength is firm they just
[1:21:03] pass
[1:21:05] they are not in trouble as other men
[1:21:07] neither are they plagued like other men
[1:21:10] therefore Pride Compass them about as a
[1:21:13] chain violence covered them as a garment
[1:21:16] aren't you thankful that the Holy Ghost
[1:21:18] is your garment
[1:21:19] aren't you thankful you've got a garment
[1:21:21] that there is a a life on the inside
[1:21:24] that desires to please God aren't you
[1:21:26] grateful you've got strength on the
[1:21:28] inside when this Pride part would want
[1:21:30] to rise up but there's that
[1:21:32] righteousness on the inside that says I
[1:21:34] desire to please him Above All Things
[1:21:37] what is it that's the real wedding
[1:21:39] garment that's the Garment of the Holy
[1:21:42] Ghost
[1:21:43] but their pride is so isolated them
[1:21:47] verse 7 their eyes stand out with
[1:21:50] fatness they have more than heart could
[1:21:53] wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly
[1:21:56] concerning oppression they speak loftily
[1:21:59] they set their mouth against the heavens
[1:22:01] and their tongue walketh through the
[1:22:02] Earth therefore his people return hither
[1:22:04] and Waters a full cup are rung out to
[1:22:07] them and they say how does God know
[1:22:11] and there is knowledge in the most high
[1:22:14] behold these are the ungodly who prosper
[1:22:19] in the world they increase in riches now
[1:22:22] remember God doesn't have a problem with
[1:22:23] rich people
[1:22:24] so we don't want to look at that in the
[1:22:26] scripture God don't have a problem with
[1:22:27] that but remember what God said it's
[1:22:30] pretty hard for one who's rich to enter
[1:22:31] in the Kingdom of the heaven he said
[1:22:33] it's easier for a camel to enter the eye
[1:22:36] of the needle which is a gate going into
[1:22:38] Jerusalem
[1:22:39] he also said in book of Corinthians that
[1:22:42] you see there's not many Rich among you
[1:22:45] neither is there many lies in this world
[1:22:50] oh my God so God don't have a problem
[1:22:52] with riches now let's just look at this
[1:22:54] verily now watch watch this watch these
[1:22:57] statements right here verse 13 and verse
[1:22:58] 14. verily this is asaph I have cleansed
[1:23:02] my heart in vain and washed my hands in
[1:23:04] innocency for all the day long have I
[1:23:06] been plagued and chastened every morning
[1:23:09] what he's been looking at I ask you has
[1:23:12] it affected his thinking
[1:23:14] it has
[1:23:16] he's beginning to look at his life as
[1:23:19] though some reward and look look it
[1:23:21] looks like I'm getting the short end of
[1:23:22] the deal here
[1:23:23] now I know asaph does not have the
[1:23:25] privilege of having the Holy Ghost like
[1:23:27] you and I do but he had it according to
[1:23:29] the measure and what God could allot
[1:23:31] within that time they never had it as an
[1:23:34] indwelling it would move and come but we
[1:23:36] we recognize within it my point is this
[1:23:38] right here
[1:23:39] what we look at and what we focus on
[1:23:41] does it affect us
[1:23:44] or have we got so big and so revelated
[1:23:47] that don't matter
[1:23:49] don't matter I know brother Ram's a
[1:23:50] prophet I know this message is the truth
[1:23:53] I know I'm the bride well the thing of
[1:23:56] it is is this
[1:23:57] I don't want to get in the Chariot with
[1:24:00] somebody who wants to ride close to the
[1:24:02] edge
[1:24:03] I want to get in I don't believe in tree
[1:24:04] hugging but I believe in Mountain
[1:24:06] hugging I want to ride in the chair the
[1:24:08] one that says I don't know I can't get
[1:24:09] that close to the edge like that but
[1:24:11] I'll tell you one thing I'll stay close
[1:24:12] to the mountain I want to stay close to
[1:24:14] Christ Jesus
[1:24:15] I know I'm safe there it might be things
[1:24:18] over the Samuel you're fine in doing
[1:24:20] that it might be true but until he gives
[1:24:23] me the direction or the approval I ain't
[1:24:26] losing out on nothing
[1:24:30] because the one thing I don't want to
[1:24:31] lose out on is his fellowship and I
[1:24:33] don't want to miss the rapture
[1:24:36] so anything else that I have to lose
[1:24:38] fine he'll give me Grace for it
[1:24:41] because evidently it wasn't something I
[1:24:44] needed nor would be able to handle in
[1:24:46] this life
[1:24:48] verse 15 if I say I will speak thus
[1:24:51] behold I should offend against the
[1:24:53] children of thy children now watch this
[1:24:54] a generation of thy children when I
[1:24:56] thought to know this it was too painful
[1:24:58] for me
[1:25:00] read verse 17 with me would you
[1:25:03] until I went into the sanctuary of God
[1:25:08] then understood I their end
[1:25:13] aren't you glad that there's a place
[1:25:14] where things can be made sense
[1:25:18] the sanctuary of a god it's a sense
[1:25:20] maker
[1:25:22] helps us to make sense and the sanctuary
[1:25:24] it isn't just this place right here but
[1:25:26] it's dwelling in his presence you can
[1:25:28] invade the presence of God your home is
[1:25:31] a sanctuary your life is a sanctuary
[1:25:34] your bedroom is a sanctuary we are to
[1:25:37] dwell in the sanctuary of the Lord
[1:25:41] but ASAP what happened I got to looking
[1:25:43] at the wrong thing I started becoming
[1:25:46] envious I started saying why is this for
[1:25:49] them and not for me and why I was trying
[1:25:51] to but you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:25:53] you can't get understanding
[1:25:57] by looking at the world you'll only get
[1:26:00] grief and bitterness and sorrow
[1:26:04] but if you will make a point oh man I
[1:26:08] can't make sense of all this just get in
[1:26:10] the sanctuary of the Lord
[1:26:13] say Lord I just need to get in your
[1:26:15] presence
[1:26:17] and when I got in his presence this is
[1:26:19] what asaph said when I got on his
[1:26:20] presence then I understood they're in
[1:26:23] you know when ASAP realized everything I
[1:26:25] was seeing it was temporal
[1:26:28] it meant nothing
[1:26:30] it puts everything back in perspective
[1:26:32] I'm glad that we've got a place that we
[1:26:34] can go
[1:26:35] there were things could be brought back
[1:26:36] in perspective because you and I both
[1:26:37] get out of perspective with things
[1:26:40] you and I have certain perspective we
[1:26:42] have certain things I'm talking about
[1:26:43] even as born-again Believers we need the
[1:26:45] spirit of God that's why we need the
[1:26:47] word Discerning the thoughts and intents
[1:26:49] of our heart
[1:26:50] so thank God where there can be a real
[1:26:52] placing of true perspectives and things
[1:26:55] can be examined through the lens of the
[1:26:57] word oh sure we we can be told no on
[1:27:00] things that maybe that we really want or
[1:27:01] want to do but ultimately what we want
[1:27:03] more than we want our wants is we want
[1:27:05] his will
[1:27:07] right ma what a fitting service on
[1:27:09] Saturday or Sunday night so we cannot
[1:27:12] afford to become entangled into things
[1:27:13] of the world look at this in verse 18.
[1:27:15] surely
[1:27:17] thou didst set them in slip replaces and
[1:27:19] thou cast them down in destruction
[1:27:22] and how are they brought to Desolation
[1:27:24] as in a moment they are utterly
[1:27:27] consumed with terrors
[1:27:32] Mark the perfect man
[1:27:34] and behold
[1:27:36] the upright for the end of that man is
[1:27:40] peace
[1:27:41] remember Jesus Jesus would actually give
[1:27:43] indicators and say
[1:27:46] remember Lot's wife
[1:27:49] three words she started out as an
[1:27:51] overcomer but she
[1:27:55] never fully surrendered her heart
[1:28:00] you started out an overcomer but what
[1:28:02] happened the calls
[1:28:04] from Sodom
[1:28:07] now what did Brother Brown say brother
[1:28:08] bran said it was this cries and calls of
[1:28:10] her grandchildren explain that I can't
[1:28:12] he said it was those calls that she
[1:28:13] began to be drawn back in upon that in
[1:28:16] other words let's just put it this way
[1:28:17] it's things that was Affinity or that
[1:28:20] pulled upon the heartstrings of her life
[1:28:23] Satan knows what strings
[1:28:25] because you know why he's pulled him in
[1:28:27] our lives before
[1:28:29] right before God before God does a full
[1:28:32] workout Satan knows it I mean he knows
[1:28:34] he knows the packages he's delivered at
[1:28:36] our house before God has sealed us with
[1:28:38] the Holy Spirit he knows that's why even
[1:28:40] after the seal has come the enemy will
[1:28:42] still try to come and test you but
[1:28:43] you're able to say nope that old boy
[1:28:45] don't live here no more
[1:28:46] sorry return to Satan
[1:28:51] the spies they went over Israel they
[1:28:55] refused to enter the land of the Holy
[1:28:57] Ghost
[1:28:58] and see what happened
[1:29:01] those that refused to follow the lord
[1:29:03] and side on this side of the transjordan
[1:29:06] the tribe of GAD let's just deal with
[1:29:08] the tribe of God
[1:29:09] you're aware so am I the maniac of
[1:29:12] gadera
[1:29:14] look what became around that Community
[1:29:15] they didn't want to move up the Holy
[1:29:17] Ghost as a matter of fact they said get
[1:29:20] out of here we don't need that stuff
[1:29:22] Jesus went across the sea
[1:29:25] because there was one we don't know his
[1:29:27] name we will on the other side a maniac
[1:29:29] of gadera
[1:29:31] look what their choice did oh they might
[1:29:33] have had whorehouse said oh or this and
[1:29:36] all that but what about your children
[1:29:39] what about everything else your choice
[1:29:41] is just not about you
[1:29:44] my choice is not just about me I'll give
[1:29:47] an account for this assembly I'll give
[1:29:50] an account for my family oh I don't want
[1:29:52] nobody else looking at me you don't have
[1:29:54] that choice
[1:29:55] you don't have that choice
[1:29:58] I don't have that choice either
[1:30:01] but I do have a choice
[1:30:03] that I can follow him
[1:30:09] what about the Rich Young Ruler in
[1:30:10] Lazarus can I have just a few more
[1:30:11] moments what about Lazarus and the Rich
[1:30:13] Young Ruler look at their Pathways the
[1:30:15] Rich Young Ruler where it took him in in
[1:30:17] life a man that was so staunch on the
[1:30:21] wrong law I've done this I've done that
[1:30:22] on doing this I've done that I've done
[1:30:24] that and a prophetic eye in this age
[1:30:25] picks him up
[1:30:27] at where he wouldn't even give the
[1:30:30] crumbs to a beggar broke the law
[1:30:33] what happened he got away from
[1:30:35] everything he had been walking in and
[1:30:37] when he turned down life eventually
[1:30:39] compromise
[1:30:41] compromise
[1:30:42] compromise
[1:30:43] it's important when we come face to face
[1:30:45] with eternal life what we do with it who
[1:30:48] would have thought that young man who
[1:30:50] Jesus could look at and know this young
[1:30:52] man had kept the Ten Commandments he was
[1:30:54] impeccable character a respectable young
[1:30:56] man that yet he made a fatal decision
[1:31:01] because he valued
[1:31:03] his possessions
[1:31:06] more than eternal life
[1:31:09] there's a pathway to follow we see that
[1:31:11] there's a pathway
[1:31:13] I want to just say it in this manner
[1:31:16] if we'll follow him the greatest words
[1:31:18] that he said come follow me and I want
[1:31:19] to follow him
[1:31:21] I believe I am and I want to continue
[1:31:24] because if you'll follow the voice of
[1:31:26] God that's speaking to your heart if you
[1:31:29] hear this if you're here tonight or one
[1:31:31] that would hear this message
[1:31:33] and you've looked at your life as
[1:31:35] impossibilities if you'll just give way
[1:31:38] to the voice instead of what you can do
[1:31:40] but accept what he's already done and
[1:31:42] begin to set your heart upon him I'm
[1:31:45] quoting a prophet he said he that will
[1:31:48] take you into the cycle of the new birth
[1:31:52] because you're following him
[1:31:56] so many times people get they get down
[1:31:58] well I didn't feel this or this or that
[1:32:00] it ain't about a feeling we can have
[1:32:01] feelings I thank God for feelings it's
[1:32:03] about this on the inside right here
[1:32:05] this is what the real change is
[1:32:08] you'll hear Brother Brown I I just don't
[1:32:10] have time you can hear brother I'm
[1:32:11] talking and giving direction in for
[1:32:12] those who's coming in prayer and
[1:32:13] adoption part one but there's a change
[1:32:15] on the inside that takes place now think
[1:32:18] about this it's important as we said
[1:32:20] earlier
[1:32:21] to know who you're following and who
[1:32:24] that person is following
[1:32:26] I mean my wife
[1:32:28] she wants to make sure that but she
[1:32:30] doesn't she doesn't hold me to it she
[1:32:32] knows that I'm following the Lord
[1:32:35] and if there's something that gets a
[1:32:36] little bit out of track
[1:32:38] she's there to help me not to side with
[1:32:40] me
[1:32:41] oh we're going to preach now
[1:32:44] you know you're right honey that family
[1:32:46] or that this or that no that ain't going
[1:32:48] to help me that's going to continue to
[1:32:49] set me and my family and the rest of the
[1:32:51] church off
[1:32:54] thank God for real help me so to be able
[1:32:56] to look at and say oh that's not how
[1:32:57] we're going to approach that not how
[1:32:59] we're going to do this no she hasn't had
[1:33:00] to do that too much
[1:33:01] but you understand
[1:33:03] whether it's job whatever it is we want
[1:33:06] to side with the word so if we're
[1:33:08] starting to go off thank God let it be
[1:33:10] somebody that's able to say this is the
[1:33:13] word why we can direct our feet back on
[1:33:17] the ways of the word because the word
[1:33:19] itself is his nature is his character
[1:33:22] it's his life
[1:33:24] right think of this
[1:33:26] Rebecca followed Eliezer
[1:33:29] who followed Abraham who followed God
[1:33:33] right here's the Paradox within it all
[1:33:36] though through all that yielding it was
[1:33:38] still a personal relationship that
[1:33:40] Rebecca had God as a reality to me
[1:33:45] Eliezer had a personal revelation God is
[1:33:48] a reality to me
[1:33:49] Abraham had a personal reality God is a
[1:33:53] reality to me so the Paradox in it all
[1:33:57] that Rebecca following Eliezer following
[1:33:59] Abraham following god well listen it was
[1:34:02] Christ's leading through the channel
[1:34:05] that's why in our lives we don't want to
[1:34:07] be a kink in the holes we want to be a
[1:34:09] channel
[1:34:11] right just as from the husband down to
[1:34:14] the wife from father down to mother we
[1:34:17] will not be a kink in it and let me just
[1:34:19] contort that no but I want to let it
[1:34:22] flow as the anointing oil would flow
[1:34:23] from Aaron's head down his beard down
[1:34:25] his garments down to his
[1:34:32] brother Samuel my husband or my my wife
[1:34:34] don't worry about them let it flow
[1:34:36] through you
[1:34:37] because the way it'll flow through you
[1:34:39] what will be in effect upon them if
[1:34:41] there's anything to be effect upon
[1:34:43] anybody it will take Christ in us to be
[1:34:45] effect upon one another
[1:34:46] is that right we can't we can't and we
[1:34:49] do not convert people by giving them the
[1:34:51] laws or the governments of the word
[1:34:54] you know I'm quoting to you now you
[1:34:56] don't do that that will not convert all
[1:34:58] that does is bring Rebellion you talk
[1:35:00] about raising up a cane and we ain't
[1:35:02] talking about the chicken place either
[1:35:03] you're talking about racing something up
[1:35:05] like that why because if it's a law it
[1:35:08] will raise Rebellion
[1:35:11] so what does it have to be it's got to
[1:35:13] be Grace live through you it's got to be
[1:35:15] grace to live through you and you know
[1:35:17] what it's going to take a whole lot of
[1:35:18] Grace for you a whole lot of Grace for
[1:35:19] me to let Grace be lived through my life
[1:35:22] for somebody else but there was one who
[1:35:24] did it for me
[1:35:27] matter of fact there was more than just
[1:35:28] one the one that made all the difference
[1:35:30] was the Lord Jesus then it just
[1:35:32] continues to come right down through the
[1:35:33] master of the age through the pastor
[1:35:35] through father and mother through oh my
[1:35:36] it just keeps going
[1:35:39] glory be to God that's why we're not a
[1:35:41] broken sister and we're not a stagnant
[1:35:42] pool his life is flowing in this
[1:35:44] fountain
[1:35:46] and you know the end itself is not
[1:35:49] something you have to wait for Mark that
[1:35:51] man behold the upright for the end
[1:35:54] is peace
[1:35:56] notice that
[1:35:58] you don't have to wait till the end I
[1:36:00] wonder what's going to become out of
[1:36:01] that
[1:36:02] I wonder what's going to happen now that
[1:36:03] no you don't have to wait
[1:36:05] you look at the direction they're going
[1:36:07] and it'll tell you what the outcome is
[1:36:09] going to be
[1:36:10] right I mean this is I know this is
[1:36:13] really simple this is Elementary but
[1:36:15] that's probably why I was in elementary
[1:36:16] school teacher
[1:36:18] I like simple things
[1:36:22] if I want to go to Cleveland I know
[1:36:24] better than to get on Route 2 going west
[1:36:28] Cleveland ain't West
[1:36:30] and I can't get on there and say
[1:36:32] I can't wait to get to Cleveland who
[1:36:34] well
[1:36:37] how are you going to get there when
[1:36:38] you're going towards Toledo
[1:36:42] what is your focus
[1:36:44] because whatever you're focused on is
[1:36:46] going to affect your thinking
[1:36:48] it's going to affect your meditation
[1:36:50] it's going to affect your talking
[1:36:52] don't you we can't fool and say oh I can
[1:36:56] ingest this and I can digest this and I
[1:36:58] can feed on this for so many hours of
[1:37:00] the day and it ain't gonna bother me no
[1:37:02] no no
[1:37:03] let me get around you for a little bit
[1:37:05] and I can tell what your focus is
[1:37:08] because whatever your focus is your
[1:37:10] conversation is going to be dominated by
[1:37:14] it is that right now they ain't putting
[1:37:15] nobody down but it's to see look how
[1:37:17] easy those things can happen instead I
[1:37:19] believe everybody in there you wouldn't
[1:37:20] be to you want beard or not I mean it
[1:37:22] took sacrifice to come on a Thursday
[1:37:24] night right you didn't depressed Beyond
[1:37:26] tiredness and weariness and probably had
[1:37:27] to bring you know toothpicks to prop
[1:37:29] your eyes open and everything else
[1:37:31] you know but the reality of it is is you
[1:37:35] realize if I can just get around this
[1:37:37] word I don't know all that's going to
[1:37:39] happen but if I can just be affected I
[1:37:41] can receive strength right here tonight
[1:37:43] that will affect my walk tomorrow it'll
[1:37:47] affect me the next day and you know what
[1:37:49] what is it how does it affect you it
[1:37:51] causes you to come right back into the
[1:37:53] prince of God tomorrow when you wake up
[1:37:55] you realize he ain't left you he ain't
[1:37:57] pulled back from me he's been right
[1:37:58] there all the time
[1:38:02] glory be to God in the highest
[1:38:07] mm-hmm
[1:38:10] Hallelujah
[1:38:15] let's go to this let me end up with this
[1:38:18] quote right here
[1:38:20] in second Corinthians
[1:38:22] second grade it's actually a scripture
[1:38:24] in this quote second Corinthians 9 24
[1:38:26] and I'm more close here
[1:38:28] I know you think I will wait and see but

[1:38:45] race run all

[1:39:20] What if I what if I came down through
[1:39:22] here and I'm like this
[1:39:26] you see what happens
[1:39:28] I start staggering almost fell over
[1:39:30] there oh it's because you don't got a
[1:39:32] good balance you know you're 47 years
[1:39:34] old and you're particular over to the
[1:39:35] matriculum no no no I won that
[1:39:38] what was it very simple my focus
[1:39:41] my very simple thing see the things
[1:39:43] that's made to be so complex it's my
[1:39:45] focus
[1:39:47] I mean
[1:39:51] no more than you could go to Cleveland
[1:39:53] going West on route 2.
[1:39:55] let's say you're going to Cleveland
[1:39:58] yes man I'm on the right way
[1:40:03] right I guess there's people that do
[1:40:04] that going to Cleveland yes someone the
[1:40:06] right way and they're heading the right
[1:40:07] way but what if they're driving going
[1:40:09] towards Cleveland I hope I'm pointing
[1:40:10] the right direction am I right nobody
[1:40:13] wants to answer that
[1:40:14] so
[1:40:15] if I'm going this way
[1:40:18] what if I'm looking at everything that's
[1:40:20] behind me in the rear view mirror what's
[1:40:22] going to happen
[1:40:26] listen I'm not brother Trevor he he
[1:40:28] gives the trick questions I'm not I
[1:40:30] can't my mind my brain ain't there
[1:40:32] that's a different gift altogether man
[1:40:36] you're going to rash you're going to cry
[1:40:37] you're gonna crash you're gonna wreck up
[1:40:39] right if you're looking at a rear view
[1:40:40] mirror so you can't eat you have to look
[1:40:43] at what's in front of you
[1:40:46] Mark the perfect man behold the upright
[1:40:49] and there's only one perfect one among
[1:40:51] us and that's Christ
[1:40:53] and I want you to remember he's in his
[1:40:55] body
[1:40:57] if you want to see the Lord Jesus look
[1:40:59] in his body
[1:41:01] because it's himself his word being
[1:41:03] revealed in the lives of his people let
[1:41:05] me finish this quote a crown given to
[1:41:07] the winner of the Olympic race was a
[1:41:09] Garland of olive branches but the crown
[1:41:10] given here in Revelation is given to a
[1:41:13] martyr that is the crown of royalty
[1:41:15] Jesus calls it the Crown of Life The One
[1:41:18] Crown is for those who striven
[1:41:21] and the other is for those who have
[1:41:22] given so striven or given both crowns
[1:41:25] are incorruptible
[1:41:28] they will not perish
[1:41:30] and the winners of the worldly race of
[1:41:33] life
[1:41:34] will soon lose the joy of the plaudits
[1:41:37] of the world wow so there's going to be
[1:41:40] some winners of the worldly race
[1:41:43] right they're going to have the big goal
[1:41:46] stand on the box
[1:41:48] winner
[1:41:50] yes we're the and they're gonna be the
[1:41:52] winner of the worldly
[1:41:55] can I say it rat race of life
[1:41:59] keeping up with keeping up on who's
[1:42:01] keeping up with who's keeping up and
[1:42:03] keeping up with the
[1:42:05] the joy and the planets of the world
[1:42:07] their Glory
[1:42:08] will fail
[1:42:13] but those
[1:42:15] who give their lives for God now watch
[1:42:17] how he says it's so simple either by
[1:42:21] daily striving or shedding their blood
[1:42:24] as the crowning sacrifice of their lives
[1:42:26] will be given the crown of life now the
[1:42:28] martyrs had to give seal the testimony
[1:42:31] their testimony with their life is that
[1:42:33] right but here we are daily striving you
[1:42:36] know what that tells me with striving
[1:42:38] there's opposition
[1:42:39] there's things wanting to pull there's
[1:42:41] pressure how many of you drove on that
[1:42:42] one drove in the Wind on the way to
[1:42:43] church tonight
[1:42:45] fun
[1:42:46] not at all you're trying to keep you
[1:42:48] know and you're like boy I'm glad I
[1:42:49] don't got a big SUV you know I don't
[1:42:50] have to worry you know you and here it
[1:42:52] is I mean the wind is just man it's
[1:42:54] blowing and it's rocking right
[1:42:56] but there's a striving that has to be
[1:42:59] done and that's striving itself
[1:43:01] sometimes with that striving as it's
[1:43:04] pressing against all the world and the
[1:43:07] things that the world wants to hold us
[1:43:09] parents can appreciate this right here
[1:43:11] there's a lot of things that likes to
[1:43:12] try to come in try to influence some
[1:43:14] things that are tried to be handed the
[1:43:17] enemy wants to come in even and through
[1:43:19] innocent channels to project
[1:43:23] its substance
[1:43:26] you wonder why you wonder why
[1:43:28] homosexuality is the way it is that's a
[1:43:31] no-brainer you know why because it
[1:43:33] started back with funny things back
[1:43:35] there in the 60s and 70s on sitcoms
[1:43:39] what is it funny lives down the guard
[1:43:42] it just lowers it
[1:43:44] look where it's at now I mean they
[1:43:46] rejected the word we understand but look
[1:43:48] at everything it's no surprise
[1:43:52] to where it is
[1:43:54] it is commonplace
[1:43:56] right sin this is a day where sin is
[1:44:00] glorified
[1:44:02] sin is regarded as a standard of virtue
[1:44:08] brother Ram talked about that when he
[1:44:09] spoke to young people
[1:44:11] he spoke about of a play they put out
[1:44:12] about Sodom and Gomorrah where somebody
[1:44:14] in that play on Simon gomar said
[1:44:16] concerning that of Sodom gomar the
[1:44:18] things that you call evil is what I call
[1:44:21] virtue
[1:44:22] see that's how what's happened
[1:44:25] where has the world been given that
[1:44:26] through oh brother Samuel they shouldn't
[1:44:28] have been messing with the Ouija boards
[1:44:29] no they were given that from church
[1:44:31] religion
[1:44:32] that's where that came in religion
[1:44:37] oh my where am we at here
[1:44:41] all too little time let's stand as I
[1:44:43] read this last one
[1:44:44] this last little part all too little
[1:44:47] time
[1:44:48] is spent on laboring
[1:44:51] for the Eternal rewards of God
[1:44:55] thank you
[1:44:56] the recompense of God
[1:44:58] is too lightly esteemed
[1:45:01] if we believe in the reality of the
[1:45:03] resurrection of the body and an eternal
[1:45:05] Kingdom of substance
[1:45:06] then we ought to lay up into heaven
[1:45:08] those good Treasures that are available
[1:45:11] to the faithful Saints
[1:45:15] in other words did it really
[1:45:18] what's your focus
[1:45:19] what are you laboring for
[1:45:22] what are you laboring for
[1:45:26] I mean I say this because I've got young
[1:45:27] parents and those of God Terry's to be
[1:45:29] parents and on and on but you know it's
[1:45:32] always something that even when it came
[1:45:34] to our children
[1:45:35] you can get your life wrapped up in your
[1:45:37] children and it'll take you right out
[1:45:41] well I got to do this for them and I got
[1:45:43] to do this and what happens is is it'll
[1:45:45] take you right away
[1:45:47] take it right away from where God has
[1:45:49] for you very innocent thing very
[1:45:50] innocent very innocent
[1:45:52] but brother Samuel there are children
[1:45:54] but you want the presence of God
[1:45:57] to move right back and you want them to
[1:45:59] be under the influence of the Holy
[1:46:02] Spirit as much as you possibly can keep
[1:46:07] it in their life
[1:46:12] I'm preaching to all that even includes
[1:46:14] his grandparents and how we give you
[1:46:16] know certain things sometimes
[1:46:18] we understand we're living in a Time
[1:46:21] where things that's just one example of
[1:46:23] something that can be so innocent
[1:46:26] and it can just taking our Focus away
[1:46:28] and we become like driving through a
[1:46:30] rear view where the only thing we know
[1:46:31] is oh how I was with God at one time why
[1:46:34] are you that that's back there where are
[1:46:37] you now
[1:46:40] if right now just stop and say Lord
[1:46:43] get me right back on track
[1:46:46] get me right back on track
[1:46:48] let me get on the right road now you
[1:46:51] know there's been times you get you
[1:46:52] exited off on the wrong road so did I
[1:46:55] but when you recognize you got off on
[1:46:57] the wrong road what do you do turn
[1:46:59] around
[1:47:00] and get back on the right Road
[1:47:03] brother Brown talked about that in his
[1:47:05] own life with that complex and things
[1:47:06] like that he said I was on a certain
[1:47:07] road but I'm on a different road now
[1:47:10] see it's it's honing in it's focusing
[1:47:12] where's our focus at
[1:47:15] who's it who's it upon who who because
[1:47:18] whatever the who is behind it and it'll
[1:47:20] tell us wherever it's leading us
[1:47:21] wherever it's directing us
[1:47:24] I I want to I want my life to be
[1:47:27] completely under his influence we're
[1:47:30] living in the hour
[1:47:32] thus saith the amen no other age could
[1:47:35] say that
[1:47:37] but the amen is the what the so be it
[1:47:40] the final word not only is this the
[1:47:42] final age and the final outpouring not
[1:47:43] only is the finishing of the mystery of
[1:47:45] God but it should be the way our life is
[1:47:47] lived Lord
[1:47:49] we've got this decision before us it
[1:47:51] might seem so innocent for myself or
[1:47:53] whoever I want to know what the amen
[1:47:55] says about it I want to know if the amen
[1:47:57] amends it
[1:48:01] right that's what we want to do I well
[1:48:03] Lord I amen no I'm not I don't want my
[1:48:05] amen I want his amen because when he
[1:48:06] commands it then I can amen it and I can
[1:48:09] amen it with confidence because I know
[1:48:10] the amen and what is the amen he's The
[1:48:12] Vindicator he's the confirmer he's the
[1:48:15] one I can rest on and say
[1:48:18] this is this is God's Direction in
[1:48:20] leadership
[1:48:21] and like as brother Trevor was dealing
[1:48:23] with that on Sunday finding the will of
[1:48:25] God
[1:48:27] just because I ain't heard nothing from
[1:48:29] him don't mean that he's like
[1:48:31] go ahead buddy
[1:48:33] buddy you ain't heard nothing from me
[1:48:34] it's all good no we wait
[1:48:38] the bride no one can persuade her to do
[1:48:42] otherwise not even her own
[1:48:46] feelings
[1:48:47] oh God
[1:48:49] help us to get there and live there
[1:48:51] that's where I want to live at that
[1:48:53] quote to me is not a quote of
[1:48:55] condemnation it's a quote that calls me
[1:48:56] to what God has equipped within my life
[1:48:59] Lord help me to realize my feelings
[1:49:00] sometimes will be against that but let
[1:49:02] me not be persuaded by my feelings or my
[1:49:06] thoughts
[1:49:07] let's pray
[1:49:13] Heavenly Father
[1:49:16] Lord I'm sure throughout this this
[1:49:18] building
[1:49:19] those on the internet and on and on
[1:49:23] Lord Jesus
[1:49:25] would ask and desire to be remembered in
[1:49:27] prayer and we do
[1:49:29] we ask the Lord I ask not only
[1:49:32] for Lord each and every one I ask for
[1:49:34] myself Lord
[1:49:36] those that would be streaming or will
[1:49:38] stream it help us Lord
[1:49:40] not to we don't want to take things for
[1:49:42] granted Lord
[1:49:44] but help us sometimes it's a striving
[1:49:46] out and that striving Lord is within our
[1:49:49] own self
[1:49:50] it's striving Lord oh not against Lord
[1:49:52] wrongful desires the grace of God by the
[1:49:55] New Birth has delivered us from that but
[1:49:57] it Lord God there can be Lord is
[1:49:59] striving against our own
[1:50:01] human nature Lord striving against our
[1:50:04] own feelings striving against things
[1:50:07] Lord but
[1:50:08] I believeth on My Heart Lord
[1:50:10] I'm a witness and I know there's others
[1:50:12] that can say your grace is sufficient
[1:50:15] Lord
[1:50:15] sometimes Lord like Noah we've had to
[1:50:17] wait on you Lord we've had to wait wait
[1:50:19] on the Lord and keep his way
[1:50:25] Lord Jesus
[1:50:27] help us Lord
[1:50:28] not just as the Lord
[1:50:30] father and a mother husband wife Pastor
[1:50:34] Deacon on and on and on and on young
[1:50:36] person
[1:50:38] Lord we want to be
[1:50:42] an example a display
[1:50:44] a witness
[1:50:46] not to draw attention to ourselves but
[1:50:48] we we want our lives to be a reflection
[1:50:50] that Lord It's like a road sign that
[1:50:53] would be
[1:50:56] as a marker
[1:50:57] yes
[1:51:00] same way keep going this way
[1:51:04] Lord I Thank You For example as the Lord
[1:51:06] throughout the congregation
[1:51:08] Paul wrote of that he admonished the
[1:51:11] order
[1:51:12] men older women
[1:51:14] older brothers older sisters he
[1:51:15] admonished the families he admonished
[1:51:17] them Lord of how that the example
[1:51:20] of the things that would be given an
[1:51:21] example that could be followed
[1:51:23] Paul even also wrote to Timothy
[1:51:26] and told Timothy don't despise your
[1:51:29] youthfulness but be
[1:51:32] an example
[1:51:34] Lord God so it doesn't matter age
[1:51:38] age itself is not the indicator
[1:51:42] it's how yielded that we can be to you
[1:51:44] Lord
[1:51:46] that's the kind of
[1:51:48] life Lord a reflection
[1:51:51] and not just for others that'll come
[1:51:53] that that will come we're living Lord
[1:51:56] because a desire is to please you
[1:52:00] how many tonight just with our heads
[1:52:02] about to say Lord that's my desire I
[1:52:03] just want to please you Lord I believe I
[1:52:06] am but I help me Lord help me in this
[1:52:08] striving help me Lord with every
[1:52:10] decision that leaves before us we're
[1:52:12] living in an hour that we cannot afford
[1:52:14] to have our lives Tangled Up
[1:52:17] as you told the prophet don't get your
[1:52:18] lines tangled up in these kind of times
[1:52:21] Lord God help us the Lord we're not to
[1:52:24] live in fear but if we can only take the
[1:52:26] admonition of the word of God not to
[1:52:29] look at things around us not to even
[1:52:31] look at the world or its worldly
[1:52:34] commentators to try to interpret to us
[1:52:36] of where we are
[1:52:39] but Lord to keep our eyes
[1:52:42] on Jesus
[1:52:44] help us Lord
[1:52:46] help us to look away to Jesus
[1:52:49] if Lord God any of us Lord anything in
[1:52:51] our life has become
[1:52:53] the focus
[1:52:55] something Lord God that maybe we went
[1:52:58] all together regard as sinful but yet
[1:53:00] when it comes down to it Lord
[1:53:02] it might be an attitude something we've
[1:53:04] given place to maybe it's bitterness
[1:53:06] maybe it's resentment maybe it's an
[1:53:08] unforgiveness what whatever it is Lord I
[1:53:11] booked out confidence in you that you've
[1:53:13] already dealt with our hearts and even
[1:53:15] now
[1:53:16] that Lord Jesus we don't want anything
[1:53:21] to detour us
[1:53:23] out of the way
[1:53:25] we don't want to drive looking in the
[1:53:27] rear view mirror
[1:53:28] neither do we want to be headed the
[1:53:30] wrong direction
[1:53:32] but I'm thankful I'm thankful oh I'm so
[1:53:34] thankful tonight
[1:53:36] that like asaph
[1:53:39] that as we come into the sanctuary of
[1:53:41] almighty God
[1:53:42] We Gather under the presence of almighty
[1:53:44] God in the Shekinah Glory that life that
[1:53:47] fills our life and Lord God in your
[1:53:50] presence things
[1:53:53] that's where sense is made not that we
[1:53:55] understand it all
[1:53:57] but Lord God we understand that Beyond
[1:53:59] everything of this life beyond my
[1:54:01] feelings Beyond everything else what's
[1:54:04] most important
[1:54:07] is him
[1:54:09] I want to follow him
[1:54:12] I don't know how to get through this
[1:54:13] trial but he'll lead me through
[1:54:16] and when I come out I will not be weaker
[1:54:18] I will be stronger in him it'll be less
[1:54:20] of Samuel but it'll be more Jesus
[1:54:22] because what needs to be gotten out in
[1:54:24] the valley of baka will be gotten out
[1:54:26] but there'll be a refreshing poured out
[1:54:29] I'm on my way
[1:54:31] I'm on my way I'm on my way home
[1:54:34] anybody join me tonight I'm on my way
