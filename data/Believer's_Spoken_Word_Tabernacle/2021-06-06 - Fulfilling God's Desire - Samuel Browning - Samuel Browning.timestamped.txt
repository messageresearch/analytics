[38:59] i know the only way to get it off my
[39:01] heart
[39:02] i want to i want to give a little
[39:05] testimony but i'm
[39:06] i'm going to be real quick so i'll quite
[39:09] a hurry
[39:10] i'll just back up a little bit i was
[39:12] kind of raised in pentecost
[39:14] and my daddy was a pentecostal preacher
[39:17] and a good one but he backslid and got
[39:19] away from god
[39:20] but i never was converted under
[39:22] pentecost
[39:24] but when i heard this word i knew this
[39:27] message
[39:28] it was god and when i first heard it
[39:31] i had tried to quit drinking and smoking
[39:33] i couldn't i was an alcoholic
[39:36] when i first heard it god took that from
[39:39] me
[39:40] i had tried to quit and couldn't but he
[39:42] took it from me
[39:44] so i i just in there
[39:47] when i when i after i received the holy
[39:51] ghost
[39:52] then some i just want to share just
[39:55] something
[39:56] here with you
[39:59] i was this is i'm going back now 1969
[40:04] and just a young christian and i was
[40:05] reading malachi 4
[40:08] and i was sitting in my chair and i was
[40:10] reading us
[40:11] and i was thinking to myself you know i
[40:15] i know brother branham fulfill this but
[40:18] i said to myself
[40:20] i don't see how he could fulfill both of
[40:22] this
[40:23] i know we understand that now to turn
[40:25] the hearts of the fathers to the
[40:26] children and the children to the fathers
[40:29] but i didn't understand that then and he
[40:32] and he spoke to me in here then and it
[40:36] truly said theo paul voice and it's so
[40:39] tender
[40:40] and he said read what john did
[40:44] i didn't know where that was that in the
[40:45] scripture but i turned right over to
[40:48] luke
[40:49] he led me and started reading or where
[40:51] the angel was talking to john's father
[40:54] that he would go in the power and
[40:55] spiritualizes to turn the hearts of the
[40:57] fathers
[40:58] to the children disobedient to the just
[41:01] and then he spoke to me and he said john
[41:04] fulfill that first part
[41:06] he said brother branham fulfilled the
[41:08] second part
[41:10] and you know when he did all this you
[41:12] could hardly
[41:14] when he was doing it i could hardly
[41:15] realize what was going on
[41:18] but when he did that and i seen it my
[41:20] heart burned deep within me
[41:22] i've never had it burn like that before
[41:24] or since
[41:26] but i know how they feel on the road to
[41:27] him as because he's the same yesterday
[41:30] today and forever
[41:32] and not just wanted a couple other
[41:34] things
[41:35] when my when my mother was dying
[41:39] and i loved my mom she stuck with us
[41:41] when
[41:42] daddy was gone and she was dying
[41:45] and i was over standing by her bed and
[41:49] that
[41:49] the nurse was there you know they knew
[41:51] she was dying
[41:53] and but her heart was you know she was
[41:56] unconscious but her
[41:57] she was you know her body was convulsion
[42:01] and stuff and it just
[42:02] was really hurting me and i was
[42:05] standing there and and he spoke to me
[42:07] and he said she'll be leaving at 5
[42:09] 55 and every time he spoke to me
[42:13] i knew it was never wrong it's always
[42:15] perfect
[42:16] and i leaned over the bed a little bit
[42:19] and i said mommy
[42:20] hang on honey because i looked at my
[42:22] watch and she had a little time i said
[42:24] you'll be leaving pretty soon hang on
[42:26] you know i said you'll be leaving at 5
[42:28] 55. and at 5 55
[42:31] she went home and even the nurse had put
[42:34] it on her report
[42:35] that's when she went and then another
[42:38] thing that's happened to me
[42:39] if i went through and i won't tell you
[42:42] all
[42:43] lies or anything of time of nervousness
[42:46] and this was a different nervousness
[42:48] than like what i'm feeling now
[42:50] just just a little nervous it was a
[42:53] nervousness that
[42:55] was out of control and even though you
[42:58] knew you were saved
[43:00] it just feels like your mind was going
[43:02] to snap
[43:03] but i knew i was saved that would be
[43:04] okay but it was like
[43:06] i don't know how to describe it you were
[43:08] in a tunnel and you couldn't find the
[43:10] end
[43:12] and that went on like that for six years
[43:16] and i was going to work this is years
[43:18] ago
[43:20] and i stopped at this light and that was
[43:23] bothering me
[43:25] and and
[43:28] i didn't know it then but i stopped
[43:31] there
[43:32] where years later we live right on that
[43:34] road bogut road
[43:36] but god knows what he's doing but while
[43:38] i was there waiting on the light he
[43:39] spoke
[43:40] to me and he said this isn't going to
[43:41] bother you anymore
[43:44] and it went away and i'm driving down
[43:46] the road
[43:47] and i'm trying to see and the tears are
[43:49] streaming
[43:50] for six years of that i can't explain to
[43:53] you
[43:54] you know all but i just but during these
[43:57] meetings
[43:59] god spoke to me and i don't want to say
[44:02] this
[44:02] he hasn't spoke to me that in a long
[44:04] that way in a long time
[44:06] he don't have to he's sovereign he knows
[44:09] what he's doing he knows when to speak
[44:10] and when to be quiet leave me leave it
[44:12] little
[44:13] so but i find that in prayer
[44:17] god still has gifts for us and he speaks
[44:19] to us through the ministry
[44:21] as many a time i've prayed and and here
[44:24] and the brother
[44:25] brother samuel come to poop but he
[44:26] didn't know he don't know what god does
[44:29] and and he speaks to you that way and
[44:31] that's helped me so much
[44:33] but during the special meetings i had
[44:36] some things happen
[44:37] to me and i like i told brother samuel
[44:41] i just felt so betrayed
[44:44] and you know it's took me
[44:47] years i would pray for others
[44:49] forgiveness and we all do
[44:51] it took me years to really mean that
[44:53] from my heart
[44:55] because god's looking right here it took
[44:57] me years
[44:59] and so i i thank god i can
[45:02] but there still was hurt i couldn't get
[45:06] rid of hurt
[45:08] i asked the lord to help me
[45:11] it it wasn't i didn't feel it was
[45:13] something bad i just
[45:14] couldn't get rid when someone you really
[45:16] love and trust
[45:18] if it was an enemy i think i could have
[45:20] handled it better
[45:21] but we know this now i understand it's
[45:24] spirits
[45:25] this spirits that cause people to do
[45:27] things if it wasn't for that they
[45:29] wouldn't do some of the things they do
[45:31] if you would be the holy spirit there
[45:33] they sure wouldn't do some things they
[45:34] could do so
[45:35] so anyway in that like saturday night
[45:39] and the brother was preaching and that
[45:41] and that soul helped me
[45:44] and helped take a lot of that hurt away
[45:48] and that's one thing i was rejoicing
[45:51] but but i know that
[45:55] in a deadly understanding he was asking
[45:58] a question after service there and i did
[46:01] i'd forgot my hearing aids
[46:03] and i thought he said something and he
[46:05] says i must he had to say something
[46:07] different
[46:08] because when i raised my hand he looked
[46:09] at me real stains and i said oh
[46:12] but please understand we human we even
[46:15] make mistakes
[46:16] but anyway i i wanted to say that he so
[46:20] help me
[46:21] another thing i want to share with you i
[46:22] i wear a hairpiece
[46:25] and i'll tell you why i have really bad
[46:27] trouble with sinuses
[46:29] but i wanted to tell you i don't want
[46:31] anything i'm
[46:32] kind of conscious self-conscious of that
[46:33] but i don't want nothing to
[46:36] be in my way or hinder my i want
[46:38] everyone to make it if we can we know
[46:40] they all won't but
[46:41] in your heart you love to see people
[46:44] come to god
[46:45] but even i had to wear a hat when i'm
[46:47] not wearing this and even to bed my
[46:49] sweetheart makes me a little hat that
[46:51] thing that i can put on and i wear them
[46:53] out and she makes me another one so i
[46:56] wanted to share that with you too
[46:57] because i just did and
[47:01] one years ago this sister gave me a
[47:03] little caption
[47:04] like a little cartoon and there was
[47:06] these two eagles in the nest
[47:08] and one of them had on like a hairpiece
[47:11] you could tell it was a hairpiece
[47:12] and the other eagle was telling him so
[47:14] why don't you just admit it you're a
[47:15] bald eagle
[47:17] so brothers do this ball you're just of
[47:20] all eagles
[47:21] god bless you
[47:30] so appreciate that don't you
[47:34] so good to be so good to hear
[47:37] the testimonies of the lord and i know
[47:39] there's more testimonies from these
[47:41] from these meetings of what of what god
[47:44] has done
[47:45] amen and i'm glad that god he's still
[47:48] moving
[47:49] he's still moving and you know sometimes
[47:52] we
[47:52] we don't always maybe have a moment or
[47:56] you know and if things that god does for
[47:58] you sometimes i'll get it by
[48:00] text or i'll get a call from somebody
[48:02] after a service or after this but
[48:04] it's really important to give your
[48:06] testimony
[48:08] amen that testimony just it spreads it's
[48:10] like fire you know
[48:11] within the church david said i will talk
[48:14] of all
[48:15] of his duties david said i won't
[48:18] worry about is it too small or what it
[48:21] is but i'm going to talk of all
[48:23] his doings amen i just
[48:26] i thank god for his mercy amen
[48:31] look we just want to turn our attention

[54:24] god is greater amen
[54:27] god is great well let's look here in the
[54:31] scripture
[54:31] verse 11 and god said
[54:36] let the earth bring forth grass
[54:40] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[54:42] tree
[54:43] yielding fruit after his
[54:47] kind whose seed is in itself
[54:50] upon the earth and it was so
[54:54] and the earth brought forth grass
[54:57] and herb yielding seed after his kind
[55:01] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[55:04] was in itself
[55:05] after his time and god saw
[55:09] that it was good you'll turn me to
[55:12] colossians chapter one i want to read
[55:14] there as well
[55:21] just a few verses of scripture that we
[55:24] want to
[55:27] read there in verse 18
[55:31] and he is the head of the body the
[55:33] church
[55:34] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[55:37] the dead
[55:38] that in all things he might have
[55:41] the preeminence for it please the father
[55:45] that
[55:45] in him should all fullness dwell having
[55:48] made peace through the blood of his
[55:50] cross
[55:51] by him to reconcile all things unto
[55:54] himself
[55:55] by him i say whether they be things in
[55:58] earth or things in heaven
[56:00] and you that were sometimes alienated
[56:03] and
[56:04] enemies in your mind by wicked works
[56:07] yet now hath he reconciled
[56:11] in the body of his flesh through death
[56:14] to present you
[56:16] holy and unblameable and unreprovable
[56:20] in his sight if you continue in the
[56:23] faith
[56:24] grounded settled and be not moved away
[56:26] from the hope of the gospel
[56:29] which you have heard and which was
[56:30] preached to every creature which is
[56:32] under heaven
[56:33] whereof i paul and made a minister who
[56:36] now rejoices
[56:38] sufferings for you and philip that which
[56:40] is behind of the afflictions of christ
[56:42] in my flesh for his body sake which is
[56:45] the church
[56:46] whereof i am made a minister i want you
[56:50] just to
[56:50] lock in on this verse whereof i am made
[56:54] a minister according to the dispensation
[56:58] of god which is given to me
[57:01] for you to fulfill the word of god
[57:06] even the mystery which hath been hid
[57:09] from ages
[57:10] and from generations but is now made
[57:12] manifest
[57:13] to his saints to whom god would make
[57:16] known what is the riches
[57:18] of the glory of this mystery among the
[57:21] gentiles
[57:22] which is christ in you
[57:25] the hope of glory whom we preach warning
[57:28] every man
[57:29] and teaching every man in all wisdom
[57:32] that we may present
[57:34] every man perfect in christ jesus
[57:38] whereunto i also labor striving
[57:41] according to his working
[57:43] which worketh in me my
[57:46] god bless you bless the reading of the
[57:48] word as you're being seated
[57:52] sorry for such a long scripture reading
[57:54] but i
[57:56] just want to draw from these these parts
[57:58] and these
[57:59] thoughts within here and speak just what
[58:02] was
[58:02] just burning on my heart and we were not
[58:04] able to even get into these
[58:06] these avenues before the meeting but
[58:10] i want to speak of i want to speak to
[58:12] you this morning on fulfilling
[58:14] god's desire
[58:18] so often and perhaps as we'll come into
[58:21] this here this morning
[58:22] we we so often speak or express of
[58:25] things that we
[58:26] can say well i'm expecting god to do
[58:29] this
[58:30] i'm expecting god to do that and i'm
[58:32] expecting god to do this
[58:34] but what i began to just drop in my
[58:37] heart just weeks ago
[58:39] god's got an expectation for us
[58:43] so many times we because in order god
[58:46] has a way in a channel
[58:47] that he fulfills his word and he doesn't
[58:49] do it any other way
[58:51] god never changes it god always works
[58:54] through the instrumentality of man and
[58:57] we're not talking about
[58:58] our flesh but we're talking about that
[59:02] part
[59:02] of that lays within our life as that
[59:05] seed
[59:06] that lays there and god himself comes
[59:09] down
[59:09] to move through that channel that he's
[59:12] already
[59:13] reserved for himself and so when we look
[59:17] at this in the very
[59:18] opening of the scripture you find that
[59:20] here you know we we find that of the
[59:22] earth
[59:23] void and darkness and so forth but
[59:26] how that is spoken here the spoken word
[59:29] of god
[59:30] would go out and god would say let the
[59:32] earth bring forth grass
[59:34] and yet the seed was already there
[59:38] in the earth god had already planted
[59:41] that seed
[59:42] within the earth his word had planted it
[59:44] there
[59:45] so when his word was spoken there now
[59:47] remember before it was
[59:48] before a word is spoken it's a thought
[59:51] so when god
[59:52] planted that seed it already had within
[59:55] it
[59:56] the thought or what god desired
[59:59] to be expressed or manifest when he said
[1:00:02] let there be grass you see when he spoke
[1:00:05] it
[1:00:06] it could be left up to a lot of
[1:00:08] interpretations
[1:00:09] before you see it but once you see it
[1:00:13] then there's no other interpretation you
[1:00:16] see
[1:00:16] this is what grass is it's the same
[1:00:19] thing
[1:00:20] when it comes to the word of god there's
[1:00:22] a lot of things that as it's spoken but
[1:00:24] yet
[1:00:25] when you see the manifestation of it and
[1:00:28] to know
[1:00:29] that the manifestation is god god
[1:00:31] vindicates it
[1:00:33] with himself his own nature soul
[1:00:36] it is now when god speaks his word
[1:00:39] it's god declaring this is the season
[1:00:43] for the life that is there in the seed
[1:00:46] that it would come forth so when the
[1:00:49] word
[1:00:50] is being expressed the word is
[1:00:52] expressing
[1:00:53] the desire that god has for that hour
[1:00:57] and there's a seed on earth that
[1:01:00] actually is the corresponding part
[1:01:02] to what god is expressing to actually
[1:01:05] be the manifestation of
[1:01:08] what god is speaking so to recognize
[1:01:12] that then
[1:01:12] as paul would lay this out here in
[1:01:15] colossians 1
[1:01:16] and paul would declare of that the very
[1:01:20] uh purpose that god how god
[1:01:23] brought him into the ministry that this
[1:01:26] being a minister he's a minister of the
[1:01:30] light
[1:01:30] and of that of the redemption of where
[1:01:33] god himself
[1:01:34] coming to bring back and establish
[1:01:37] a preeminence in his church in the lives
[1:01:40] of his children and paul would say this
[1:01:43] is
[1:01:43] my purpose and remember paul had a lot
[1:01:46] of other ambitions
[1:01:47] paul had a lot of other goals paul was
[1:01:50] not a lazy guy
[1:01:51] he had ambitions about things but you
[1:01:53] see when he met
[1:01:55] god on the road to damascus
[1:01:58] when he met god face to face right then
[1:02:01] and there
[1:02:02] he lost sight of every ambition
[1:02:06] because he realized the paths and the
[1:02:08] directions that that was going
[1:02:11] even though he thought that was right
[1:02:13] remember the bible says
[1:02:14] there is a way that seemeth right unto
[1:02:17] man
[1:02:18] but wind thereof are the waves of death
[1:02:21] you see that's why
[1:02:22] we do not walk by feelings we have to
[1:02:25] walk by
[1:02:26] side and that is to look at and say if
[1:02:29] this is where something is now
[1:02:32] where will it be on down the road
[1:02:35] you know how it is some of you that
[1:02:36] shoot guns or bows or whatever more
[1:02:38] if you're off at five yards you're
[1:02:40] definitely going to be off at 100 yards
[1:02:42] it don't automatically you know what i'm
[1:02:44] talking about brother joy you know
[1:02:45] automatically all of a sudden
[1:02:47] you don't get in there in a prayer and a
[1:02:48] hope and it's going to hit it at 100
[1:02:50] yards it now becomes further
[1:02:52] off that's why at the very beginning it
[1:02:55] must be
[1:02:56] started right and zeroed in on the right
[1:02:59] target because
[1:03:00] if it's zeroed on the right target now
[1:03:03] later down the line
[1:03:04] it'll be hitting the target right on
[1:03:07] is that right so you see this is god's
[1:03:10] desire
[1:03:11] how god would express this and paul
[1:03:13] would express
[1:03:15] that there is the dispensation that god
[1:03:18] had committed to paul that was that was
[1:03:21] for
[1:03:22] the children of god let me just say this
[1:03:24] to you this scripture in verse 25 right
[1:03:27] here
[1:03:28] paul believed that he was going to see
[1:03:32] the very rapture and the transformation
[1:03:35] of the body of believers he believed
[1:03:38] that he would
[1:03:39] see them but you see god did not let
[1:03:42] them know
[1:03:42] that there's going to be seven ages
[1:03:46] is that right god didn't need to let
[1:03:48] them know that
[1:03:49] in order for them to live victorious
[1:03:52] they only
[1:03:53] had to receive the light and the message
[1:03:56] for their time and their day and it
[1:03:59] would bring
[1:03:59] forth an overcoming life because that's
[1:04:02] the kind of seed
[1:04:04] that god has planted on the earth is
[1:04:07] seeds of
[1:04:08] overcomers because god himself
[1:04:11] is an overcomer god has never been
[1:04:14] defeated
[1:04:15] his word has never been defeated it
[1:04:17] never will be defeated
[1:04:19] it cannot be defeated and you and i are
[1:04:22] a part of that word
[1:04:23] you can't be defeated
[1:04:27] hallelujah paul said i'm given this
[1:04:31] dispensation because
[1:04:33] god himself had reserved that
[1:04:36] that he would have a body a bride
[1:04:39] a wife one that he himself that would be
[1:04:42] able
[1:04:43] to reflect and receive his seed life
[1:04:46] and he would actually be able to reflect
[1:04:49] his
[1:04:50] life through his church remember the
[1:04:52] moon itself
[1:04:53] reflects the light of the sun is that
[1:04:56] right
[1:04:57] and to see that even how the scripture
[1:04:59] would say that
[1:05:00] the glory of the man is the woman is
[1:05:02] that right
[1:05:04] because whatever is is to be reflected
[1:05:07] you see
[1:05:07] this is why god does not want the seed
[1:05:10] of any other man in the church god don't
[1:05:13] want people
[1:05:14] god does not want the church sowed with
[1:05:17] thoughts of other men
[1:05:19] you know why it produces deadness
[1:05:22] it produces a deadness where life
[1:05:25] leaves the church of the living god i
[1:05:28] don't care if it's quotes being read
[1:05:30] i don't care if the scripture is being
[1:05:31] read once it becomes
[1:05:33] under a man's idea then it becomes
[1:05:36] a place of death are you hearing me
[1:05:39] you see where there must be that where
[1:05:42] the word is
[1:05:43] there is life there is
[1:05:46] liberty there it brings forth sons and
[1:05:49] daughters
[1:05:50] of god that reflect what god was
[1:05:53] choosing
[1:05:54] god does not want his bride bearing the
[1:05:55] image of any other man
[1:05:58] and you see it isn't man that's tried to
[1:06:01] do it but it is satan's desire
[1:06:03] to always get in there are you with me
[1:06:07] so this is why that you know when it
[1:06:09] comes down to it
[1:06:10] we i'll just flatly say it like this i
[1:06:13] don't need any other man's
[1:06:14] interpretation of this message
[1:06:18] they can keep it and dump it in the
[1:06:19] trash can
[1:06:21] i'll say it point blank god has sent to
[1:06:24] us
[1:06:25] the perfect interpretation and
[1:06:27] revelation
[1:06:28] in this hour and the same mighty angel
[1:06:31] that inspired the prophet
[1:06:33] and stood there night after night and
[1:06:36] opened the seals
[1:06:37] and revealed the word that's the same
[1:06:39] mighty angel that we're living under the
[1:06:41] inspiration
[1:06:42] and the pulsation of that life we're not
[1:06:45] bringing forth the image of a man
[1:06:47] we're bringing forth the image of jesus
[1:06:49] christ
[1:06:53] hallelujah so when we look at this this
[1:06:57] this
[1:06:58] element paul he would express it was to
[1:07:01] fulfill god
[1:07:02] has committed this to me he would feel
[1:07:05] the
[1:07:05] urgency that this would be to fulfill
[1:07:09] that's given to me for you to fulfill
[1:07:13] that word means complete the word of god
[1:07:17] we're living in the hour of the
[1:07:19] completion
[1:07:22] paul would write it like this the ends
[1:07:24] of the world are come upon us
[1:07:27] we're not coming to it we've arrived
[1:07:32] this is why brother branham would say it
[1:07:34] like this in invisible union
[1:07:37] he said now he says to the church
[1:07:40] the body of christ we're trying to lead
[1:07:43] to
[1:07:43] deeper thoughts and higher objectives
[1:07:47] believing that the coming of the lord
[1:07:49] jesus is at hand
[1:07:51] now let me tell you let me just drop
[1:07:52] this in here when you think of these two
[1:07:55] thoughts deeper thoughts
[1:07:56] and higher objectives there there is a
[1:07:59] place that when it talks about
[1:08:01] has as it was even uh in the days of lot
[1:08:05] in the days of noah the bible says
[1:08:06] they build it they sold and they married
[1:08:09] were given in marriage and
[1:08:10] all these other things that they were
[1:08:12] going going through and doing
[1:08:14] but you see they had objectives but it's
[1:08:17] just
[1:08:18] their objectives were misplaced
[1:08:21] are you hearing me it's it's wonderful
[1:08:24] and i'll speak this to the young people
[1:08:26] or anybody else
[1:08:28] you should have an objective in life
[1:08:32] but don't let there be any other
[1:08:33] objective
[1:08:35] ahead of jesus christ
[1:08:40] you can't put nothing ahead of him and
[1:08:42] expect it to come out right
[1:08:45] he must be first
[1:08:49] so here as the prophet would speak and
[1:08:52] express of this
[1:08:53] this is deeper than just our natural
[1:08:55] objectives in life
[1:08:57] this is when he would speak of this
[1:08:58] deeper thoughts and higher objectives
[1:09:00] that's what we're trying to lead
[1:09:02] the body of christ into and he would
[1:09:04] speak and say we're looking for the
[1:09:06] coming of the lord
[1:09:07] in our generation he said i'm not
[1:09:09] looking for a revival on our generation
[1:09:12] i'm looking for the coming of the lord
[1:09:14] in our
[1:09:15] generation brother brown would go on to
[1:09:17] say this now at the end
[1:09:18] the of that same message invisible union
[1:09:21] and he would speak of a sister he said
[1:09:23] there's a sister out of a denomination
[1:09:25] and she said brother brown i belong to a
[1:09:27] denomination
[1:09:28] so we don't have to call that the name
[1:09:30] of it but she said brother branham
[1:09:32] i want to get out to the truth i want
[1:09:35] something deeper than that
[1:09:38] he said let me quote this blessed are
[1:09:41] they that do hunger
[1:09:42] and thirst after righteousness for they
[1:09:44] shall
[1:09:45] be filled you see god has not called us
[1:09:50] the deep and the deeper thoughts and
[1:09:52] higher objectives we
[1:09:53] we recognize it's deeper than just
[1:09:55] coming to a church
[1:09:56] it's deeper than just being associated
[1:09:59] with the message
[1:10:00] it's deeper than that it's deeper than
[1:10:02] knowing that god sent a prophet
[1:10:04] it's deeper than knowing the scriptures
[1:10:06] it's deeper than knowing the message
[1:10:08] it deeper it comes into the very depth
[1:10:11] of jesus christ
[1:10:12] to where he is the innermost one in our
[1:10:15] life
[1:10:17] a higher objective objective that is
[1:10:21] based on him not on what i can
[1:10:24] accumulate
[1:10:25] what i can amount to or what can i what
[1:10:27] can i rise to
[1:10:28] but the objective is jesus christ
[1:10:36] you see these are these are our results
[1:10:39] these are our desires
[1:10:40] we want we want something deeper some
[1:10:43] what we are
[1:10:44] living for is a higher objective david
[1:10:47] would write it like this in psalms 42 1
[1:10:50] as the heart paneth after the water
[1:10:52] blows
[1:10:53] so panteth my soul
[1:10:56] after the oh god you can satisfy flesh
[1:11:00] you can satisfy your spirit but your
[1:11:02] soul is what cries out for the living
[1:11:04] god
[1:11:05] because you are made to thirst and
[1:11:06] there's only one that can satisfy that
[1:11:08] thirst
[1:11:10] man can go for many years in their life
[1:11:12] trying to satisfy that thirst but
[1:11:14] only one can do it you were put here to
[1:11:17] fulfill
[1:11:18] a purpose of god and you must come to it
[1:11:21] sooner
[1:11:21] or later
[1:11:23] [Applause]
[1:11:25] my soul david said bursteth for god
[1:11:28] for the living god he didn't say i'm
[1:11:30] thirsting for church
[1:11:33] i'm thirsting for god for the living god
[1:11:37] when shall i come and appear before god
[1:11:40] in verse seven
[1:11:41] deep calleth unto the deep at the noise
[1:11:43] of thy waters pout how many glad when
[1:11:45] his waters pout you hear them
[1:11:48] come on the voice of many waters you
[1:11:50] hear the stirring of the water
[1:11:52] you see the same angel of the lord that
[1:11:54] comes down
[1:11:55] upon the water of his word and begins to
[1:11:58] trouble that word
[1:11:59] and he begins to deal with your heart
[1:12:00] everybody else can look around you can
[1:12:02] be sitting right next to somebody else
[1:12:04] they don't there to them it's just
[1:12:05] passing right through them but to you
[1:12:07] there's reverberations of the ways of
[1:12:10] the holy ghost
[1:12:11] how brother it's more than an emotion
[1:12:14] it's more than a feeling it might make
[1:12:16] you emotional but it's something
[1:12:18] that's reaching down to the depths of
[1:12:21] your being
[1:12:21] and you're hearing personally from
[1:12:24] god it's drawing something out of you
[1:12:29] deep call it to the deep at the noise of
[1:12:31] thy water spouts
[1:12:33] all thy waves all thy billows are gone
[1:12:36] over me
[1:12:37] yet the lord will command his
[1:12:39] lovingkindness in the daytime and in the
[1:12:41] night
[1:12:42] his songs shall be with me and my prayer
[1:12:45] unto the god of my life
[1:12:50] branham here in the message he takes
[1:12:52] this and he speaks of how
[1:12:55] refer to a few places he said there's
[1:12:57] something he said
[1:12:59] that he says i know now of the lord that
[1:13:01] i didn't know a week ago.
[1:13:03] and he said and that is i know he has a
[1:13:06] channel
[1:13:08] ye are the branches we're the one that
[1:13:10] bears the fruit
[1:13:12] he's the vine that furnishes the energy
[1:13:15] but the branches bear the fruit in my
[1:13:18] name you shall cast out devils
[1:13:20] nothing shall harm you by no means then
[1:13:23] we're wrapped in the bundle of
[1:13:25] life god every believer
[1:13:29] and he goes on to say how that what god
[1:13:32] has given to us
[1:13:33] as believers is a checkbook when we
[1:13:36] receive the holy ghost
[1:13:38] god's own life has been deposited inside
[1:13:41] of you you have received a checkbook
[1:13:45] he don't need to put his name on it his
[1:13:47] name's already on it
[1:13:51] might be pretty simple but let me bring
[1:13:52] the example if you had a chat
[1:13:55] or you got it those of you that got
[1:13:56] checks you know there's one thing about
[1:13:58] it
[1:13:59] you would never write a check and put
[1:14:01] your name on it
[1:14:02] and just hand it out to somebody right
[1:14:06] when's the last time you did that for a
[1:14:07] birthday
[1:14:10] you put a certain amount on it don't you
[1:14:12] you just don't put a name on
[1:14:14] a check and just say well here you go
[1:14:16] because you know
[1:14:17] if your name's on that check right there
[1:14:19] they can write it out
[1:14:21] paid to the order of whoever and they
[1:14:23] can write out whatever amount of money
[1:14:26] is that right are you hearing me but you
[1:14:28] see
[1:14:29] jesus christ himself has given this to
[1:14:32] the believer
[1:14:33] because he knows that the very desires
[1:14:36] on the inside
[1:14:37] of a believer are only godly desires
[1:14:41] and he's the one that the noise of his
[1:14:43] water spouts
[1:14:44] that begins to stir up desires and you
[1:14:46] say that's what i have need of
[1:14:48] he said you got the checkbook son go
[1:14:51] ahead and write it out
[1:14:52] there is plenty in the bank there is no
[1:14:55] insufficient funds
[1:14:58] there is no lacking he still is powerful
[1:15:01] he still heals the he still
[1:15:04] delivers
[1:15:04] he's still cast out devils he still
[1:15:08] feels with the holy ghost you've got a
[1:15:11] checkbook and it don't do no good to
[1:15:12] write it out and put in your pocket
[1:15:14] either
[1:15:18] tell a little story i had somebody one
[1:15:20] time
[1:15:21] one time that i know of they gave me a
[1:15:22] check for my birthday
[1:15:24] they know i like ice cream so they wrote
[1:15:26] me a check and put in a burner birthday
[1:15:27] card and they said
[1:15:28] bro samuel go have ice cream on us
[1:15:32] well guess what that check i found it
[1:15:34] two years later
[1:15:36] you know you know i'm kind of a
[1:15:38] organized person i'm not a nut in it but
[1:15:40] i mean
[1:15:40] you understand i i i i don't know all i
[1:15:43] got to look at i thought well my lord
[1:15:45] how did that escape me here it was in
[1:15:46] that card
[1:15:47] all i could think about is that laid
[1:15:49] there for two years and i missed out
[1:15:51] on triple scoops at mitchell's i missed
[1:15:54] out
[1:15:54] on on you know on wild berry cobbler and
[1:15:57] all those things like that
[1:15:59] because i i forgot that that was in
[1:16:02] there
[1:16:04] are you with me he was there the whole
[1:16:05] time
[1:16:07] is that right but i had it tucked away
[1:16:10] you see that's the same way
[1:16:11] when you make out the check and the
[1:16:13] devil says it'll never happen
[1:16:15] rebuke that devil and go ahead and send
[1:16:17] it in there's a clearing clearinghouse
[1:16:19] there's a god who's inspiring you he'll
[1:16:22] make
[1:16:23] good on that promise hallelujah
[1:16:28] amen every redemptive blessing belongs
[1:16:31] to you
[1:16:32] look at the situations arise things that
[1:16:36] arise
[1:16:37] in our lives instead of looking at the
[1:16:40] situations of
[1:16:41] how am i going to get out of this look
[1:16:42] at it as an opportunity for god to
[1:16:44] manifest himself
[1:16:47] are you with me it's an opportunity
[1:16:50] for god to manifest himself brother
[1:16:52] brown would
[1:16:53] say it like this in fundamental
[1:16:55] foundation of faith
[1:16:57] what did christ redeem us for he said
[1:17:00] you ever think about it
[1:17:01] he said why didn't god just say well i
[1:17:03] just put his name on the book and
[1:17:05] you know the atonement and i'll just
[1:17:07] there's no need of giving him any deep
[1:17:09] powers and
[1:17:10] no need in making this man a son of god
[1:17:11] there's no need in doing that
[1:17:13] i'll just ask him to believe it and
[1:17:15] write his name in the book of heaven and
[1:17:17] that'll settle it but he gave us these
[1:17:20] redeemed blessings that he that
[1:17:23] we might operate the work of god by the
[1:17:26] energy
[1:17:27] of the holy spirit you see when it's
[1:17:30] just
[1:17:30] write your name on a book and just
[1:17:32] believe it he still is not glorified
[1:17:35] to be glorified he wants to be manifest
[1:17:39] through his body through your life
[1:17:43] hey listen there's no greater
[1:17:44] testimonies like brother dave was
[1:17:46] standing right here i could testify
[1:17:47] right with it he stood right here he
[1:17:49] spoke about this is the kind of life
[1:17:51] that it was before life came to me
[1:17:54] and then the reality is is that the
[1:17:57] message itself
[1:17:58] it brought life to him are you with me
[1:18:01] here on life that tried to get free of
[1:18:03] drinking tried to get free of that right
[1:18:06] there
[1:18:06] but the spirit of god it moves down and
[1:18:09] it energizes that seed
[1:18:10] on the inside it wasn't something he had
[1:18:13] to give up
[1:18:14] he wanted ten steps to quit it's the
[1:18:16] power of god
[1:18:17] that comes down and changes the desire
[1:18:20] you don't need a patch on your arm
[1:18:22] to stop smoking cigarettes you just need
[1:18:25] to meet
[1:18:26] jesus christ you need more than a patch
[1:18:29] for your life
[1:18:30] you need a meeting with jesus christ
[1:18:34] he won't just patch you up he'll make
[1:18:36] you a new man
[1:18:37] he'll make you a new woman on the inside
[1:18:43] hallelujah that's god's desire that's
[1:18:46] why you can't get away from it
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:52] hallelujah oh my he said
[1:18:55] but the fruit now he says it's got to be
[1:18:59] brought forth from a vine or the fruit
[1:19:01] can't be brought forth from a vine
[1:19:03] it has to have the branch to bear the
[1:19:05] fruit the vine with all of its energy
[1:19:08] cannot produce anything unless the
[1:19:10] branch
[1:19:12] is willing to receive the energy
[1:19:16] it's a big statement here you ready god
[1:19:19] is depending on you as a member of his
[1:19:23] body
[1:19:24] to bear fruit of his spirit
[1:19:30] god is depending on you as a member of
[1:19:33] his body
[1:19:34] to bear fruit of his spirit now don't
[1:19:36] forget what he just said above that
[1:19:38] the vine cannot bear the fruit
[1:19:41] but it's the branches but the branches
[1:19:44] must be in
[1:19:44] the vine and then the life which
[1:19:47] energizes
[1:19:49] the branch is what brings forth the
[1:19:52] fruit
[1:19:54] so in other words all god wants is
[1:19:56] channels
[1:19:57] that have been redeemed that are open
[1:19:59] and that
[1:20:00] are available and yielded to him
[1:20:05] oh glory be to god i'll think of this
[1:20:07] brother if he's depending
[1:20:09] on you let's open up our channels let
[1:20:11] the holy spirit come in tonight
[1:20:13] and energize us and free us from all
[1:20:16] these fears
[1:20:17] and doubt oh i like this too i got to
[1:20:20] keep reading this
[1:20:21] he said god healed the sick in every age
[1:20:24] and will continue to do it in every age
[1:20:28] where people and churches are willing to
[1:20:31] let loose
[1:20:32] and let the holy spirit take control
[1:20:35] of their being and then they say lord
[1:20:38] take control
[1:20:39] take control jesus you see
[1:20:43] he would go on and i'm just really
[1:20:44] trying to lay these things in here
[1:20:46] on god's purpose fulfilling god's desire
[1:20:50] brother branham would take it here in
[1:20:51] the same message and he would say
[1:20:53] as he's praying he said god help the
[1:20:56] people to recognize
[1:20:57] from the message this morning and that's
[1:21:00] what he was preaching on being
[1:21:01] being channels of god he says that their
[1:21:04] purpose
[1:21:05] is not to go to work come in at night
[1:21:08] eat the meals go to bed read the paper
[1:21:11] the next morning
[1:21:12] go back to work again day in and day out
[1:21:16] neither is it to go to church on sunday
[1:21:18] morning
[1:21:19] listen to the sermon go home go to work
[1:21:22] father we're here to be instruments
[1:21:26] of yours you redeem them back to their
[1:21:30] right estate
[1:21:31] man in his right mind believes god
[1:21:34] for all things hallelujah
[1:21:38] just as simple as i made it here i think
[1:21:40] it was on that friday night the
[1:21:41] microphone this microphone i've got or
[1:21:44] this one right here
[1:21:45] it's no more than just an instrument
[1:21:47] these glasses that i have
[1:21:48] they are no more than just an instrument
[1:21:51] they want they will not
[1:21:52] they will not do me no good unless
[1:21:54] they're on my face
[1:21:56] they are an instrument that helps me see
[1:21:59] the print and see some of y'all better
[1:22:04] that's one thing it does but it's an
[1:22:07] instrument
[1:22:09] just the way these glasses are i pick
[1:22:11] them up
[1:22:12] and i lay them down they're not fighting
[1:22:13] with me i don't have to chase them
[1:22:15] around the table
[1:22:17] i'm not chasing them i don't they're
[1:22:19] right there what they
[1:22:21] are they're right where i have them all
[1:22:23] i got to do
[1:22:24] is reach down and pick them up the power
[1:22:27] as it motivates from my mind
[1:22:29] to reach down and put my hand upon them
[1:22:31] and pick them up
[1:22:32] then they'll they do they don't fight
[1:22:34] against it they yield so the only thing
[1:22:36] god is asking you and i to do
[1:22:38] he's not asking you and i to figure it
[1:22:40] out to try to explain it
[1:22:42] all he wants us to do is just yield to
[1:22:45] his
[1:22:46] hand
[1:22:50] amen hallelujah we are
[1:22:53] instruments amen of him
[1:22:58] glory hallelujah
[1:23:02] now look at this let me come back into
[1:23:04] this point
[1:23:06] now let's come into this colossians 1 25
[1:23:09] whereof paul said i am made a minister
[1:23:12] according to the dispensation of god
[1:23:14] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[1:23:18] or complete the word of god
[1:23:22] every age god has had a purpose
[1:23:26] you see it even from genesis 1 every day
[1:23:29] of creation god had a purpose now you
[1:23:33] know how it feels sometimes
[1:23:34] where you have maybe as a person you've
[1:23:36] laid on a lot of things that you needed
[1:23:38] to get done
[1:23:39] we're going to do this we're going to do
[1:23:40] this we're going to do this we're going
[1:23:41] to do this on memorial day weekend and
[1:23:42] you realize
[1:23:43] i barely got this let alone that that
[1:23:46] that that that that
[1:23:48] right because there's there's only you
[1:23:50] have to recognize
[1:23:51] there's only so much that you can get
[1:23:53] done but god
[1:23:54] what god has done he designates
[1:23:57] so much of his word for a season for a
[1:24:01] time
[1:24:01] for an age and yet that word
[1:24:05] here the promises have been laying over
[1:24:08] the ages
[1:24:09] men have probed at them because there
[1:24:12] have been something
[1:24:13] burning and longing in the heart of the
[1:24:16] believer
[1:24:16] to see the fulfillment of the word let
[1:24:19] me just tell you something right now
[1:24:21] if luther was right here in sheffield
[1:24:23] this morning
[1:24:24] luther wouldn't be out of lutheran
[1:24:25] church
[1:24:27] he'd be right here shouting if wesley
[1:24:30] come on now
[1:24:31] if wesley was here right here he
[1:24:34] wouldn't be at a methodist church
[1:24:36] i don't care if it's next door if
[1:24:39] brother bosworth was here
[1:24:40] or william seymour from out there in los
[1:24:43] angeles
[1:24:44] they wouldn't be at the local
[1:24:45] pentecostal church they'd be sitting
[1:24:47] right
[1:24:48] here this morning if you could keep them
[1:24:50] sitting
[1:24:51] why because they were moved by the
[1:24:54] purpose
[1:24:55] of god in their day they were living to
[1:24:59] see
[1:24:59] this word fulfilled
[1:25:03] luther would look back at that and say
[1:25:05] that ain't the inspiration of god
[1:25:07] wesley will look at the methodist church
[1:25:09] and say that ain't the inspiration of
[1:25:12] god
[1:25:12] about dr basworth would stand there and
[1:25:14] say back to pentecost
[1:25:16] that ain't the inspiration of god but
[1:25:19] they would stand here
[1:25:20] just like peter walking in the back door
[1:25:22] paul walking in the back door
[1:25:24] stephen walking in the back door they
[1:25:26] would rally
[1:25:28] in this moment
[1:25:29] [Applause]
[1:25:33] hallelujah
[1:25:34] [Applause]
[1:25:36] every age there's a purpose
[1:25:41] now let's bring it down home to the
[1:25:42] lunchbox every age there's a purpose
[1:25:46] every church there's a purpose
[1:25:51] every home there's a purpose every
[1:25:53] individual life it's a purpose
[1:25:56] it all works down in the great economy
[1:25:58] and divine order of almighty god
[1:26:02] you see it will be god in in as it was
[1:26:05] in every age as when here
[1:26:08] remember zechariah standing there and
[1:26:11] the
[1:26:12] the angel of the lord began to show him
[1:26:13] the the candelabras and things and
[1:26:16] he asked him what is it he said i don't
[1:26:17] know what is it and he began to to show
[1:26:19] him
[1:26:20] uh a symbol a picture of of the church
[1:26:24] of the living god and how that zechariah
[1:26:27] was looking at it you know
[1:26:29] it's one thing to see a symbol but to
[1:26:31] recognize god himself
[1:26:32] is the interpreter of these symbols just
[1:26:35] like uh when he said i'm the vine
[1:26:37] you're the branches god use something
[1:26:39] that is there
[1:26:40] even in nature to describe his children
[1:26:43] or his people
[1:26:44] and there within that part of the
[1:26:46] candelabra we realize that here as an
[1:26:48] instrument there are wicks that go down
[1:26:50] in there there is oil down beneath
[1:26:52] and the oil that is beneath is now
[1:26:55] brought to light
[1:26:56] because when they light that wick the
[1:26:59] wick itself
[1:27:00] is down in the oil and there's fire on
[1:27:03] top
[1:27:03] and he was looking at the symbol and how
[1:27:06] god spoke to him and let him know
[1:27:08] that this is not by might nor by power
[1:27:12] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:27:15] he was announcing to zechariah right
[1:27:18] there that spoke of the hour
[1:27:20] that you and i are living in that has
[1:27:22] spoke of the seven
[1:27:24] church ages it speaks of god's working
[1:27:27] even when he turns to visit
[1:27:28] the jews it will be an operation of the
[1:27:32] holy spirit revealing jesus christ as
[1:27:35] the true atonement
[1:27:36] and make them ready for their joseph
[1:27:40] are you with me it's all god's working
[1:27:42] at hand
[1:27:43] and to see that even within all of this
[1:27:46] this is what god is saying
[1:27:48] that god achieves his purpose
[1:27:51] amen by placing his spirit
[1:27:54] inside of your life and my life and he
[1:27:57] uses his spirit in our life to
[1:27:59] accomplish his
[1:28:00] work all he needs is for you and i to
[1:28:03] surrender
[1:28:06] more that surrendering never stops does
[1:28:08] it
[1:28:09] it's continuing it's continuous
[1:28:11] surrendering you see so often times and
[1:28:14] coming into the point oftentimes we we
[1:28:17] express
[1:28:17] that you know we're expecting god to
[1:28:19] come and fulfill his word
[1:28:21] well you know i i'm just waiting on god
[1:28:23] to fulfill his word and i'm waiting on
[1:28:24] god to fulfill his word
[1:28:26] but god does always fulfill his word
[1:28:28] there's not one word that god
[1:28:30] leaves unfulfilled over and over we can
[1:28:34] run it in the scripture
[1:28:35] i'm god i change not and though the word
[1:28:37] that's gone on my lips i will not alter
[1:28:39] on and on we could go with that
[1:28:40] god said my word won't return unto me
[1:28:42] void
[1:28:44] is that right you see there's living
[1:28:46] witnesses right here
[1:28:48] this morning that have received a
[1:28:51] promise of god
[1:28:52] into your heart of that of the holy
[1:28:54] ghost which is the word
[1:28:56] himself in your life and you can stand
[1:28:59] right here
[1:28:59] there might be needs it's pressing in
[1:29:01] your life but you realize
[1:29:03] as a believer that what i have i have
[1:29:06] everything that i have need of
[1:29:12] is that right everything that i have
[1:29:14] need of god has already
[1:29:16] provided it glory be to god god
[1:29:20] gave you the strength when he gave you
[1:29:22] the holy ghost he gave you the strength
[1:29:24] in your life
[1:29:25] to live a victorious life he put not a
[1:29:27] fear
[1:29:28] but the love of god where you find the
[1:29:30] things of the world
[1:29:31] fleeing from your life the things that
[1:29:33] you once loved
[1:29:34] the things you once cared about the
[1:29:37] things you once desired
[1:29:38] that would be natural and normal
[1:29:41] according to your first birth
[1:29:42] but you no longer desire them
[1:29:47] why because a greater one has come into
[1:29:50] your life
[1:29:52] and the love of god is reigning there
[1:29:56] oh i wish i was twice my size right now
[1:30:01] i feel good god
[1:30:06] he takes and he fulfills his word
[1:30:09] through his predestinated channels
[1:30:11] in his predestinated season now you know
[1:30:14] this as believers
[1:30:16] with thee with promises laying out now
[1:30:18] these are promises remember we're
[1:30:19] talking about purposes
[1:30:20] not just for the age the purpose for the
[1:30:22] age purpose for the church
[1:30:24] purpose for your life purpose for home
[1:30:28] there are promises that lay
[1:30:31] that have laid down through time and you
[1:30:34] know how satan works
[1:30:35] satan's objective even with a promise
[1:30:38] that's been made known
[1:30:39] is he wants to try to remove
[1:30:43] patience
[1:30:46] god is not an impatient god that's never
[1:30:49] been one of his characteristics
[1:30:51] the spirit of god does not make a life
[1:30:53] impatient as a matter of fact the spirit
[1:30:55] of god
[1:30:55] i'm trying i'm preaching to somebody
[1:30:57] this morning i'm telling you where
[1:30:58] you've got grounds that you can stand
[1:31:00] and you can back that devil right up
[1:31:02] you don't got to make him a little side
[1:31:04] shack on your house
[1:31:05] you can back him right up the bible says
[1:31:07] be careful for
[1:31:08] nothing that means be anxious for
[1:31:11] nothing when that old thing wants to
[1:31:13] kind of come around you
[1:31:14] like you feel like i got to do this and
[1:31:16] i got to do this and time's running out
[1:31:17] here
[1:31:18] and this or that you just stand right in
[1:31:19] the face and you rebuke that devil
[1:31:21] because you are not a creature of time
[1:31:25] you're a creature of eternity you're a
[1:31:28] child of god
[1:31:29] that waits on god to fulfill his word
[1:31:32] you
[1:31:32] you become a vessel that is available
[1:31:35] when god says
[1:31:36] now is the time here you are like the
[1:31:38] glasses
[1:31:39] patiently waiting patient doesn't mean
[1:31:41] we're laying around and well we forget
[1:31:43] about it that ain't patience
[1:31:45] patience means we're laying in the
[1:31:48] promise
[1:31:49] of god with a steadfastness to say lord
[1:31:52] i'm expecting on you to fulfill your
[1:31:55] word
[1:31:56] and here i am lord as a channel
[1:31:59] we are keeping ourselves built up in the
[1:32:02] holy ghost
[1:32:03] available ready sensitive
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:09] don't you want to stay sensitive
[1:32:12] i want to stay sensitive to him
[1:32:16] now let me just try to work here on this
[1:32:18] look how it says
[1:32:19] in psalms 44 1. now this is talking
[1:32:22] about when israel came into the land it
[1:32:26] says now
[1:32:27] to the chief musician for the sons of
[1:32:29] cora i wish i could preach on that a
[1:32:31] little bit
[1:32:32] more there were some sons that realized
[1:32:36] they had a great greater representation
[1:32:38] than their rebellious daddy
[1:32:41] they refused to be identified with his
[1:32:43] uprising against the message
[1:32:46] come on somebody the seed gene on the
[1:32:49] inside
[1:32:50] was greater than anything their daddy or
[1:32:52] their natural
[1:32:53] family tree could ever do it was greater
[1:32:56] than any curse
[1:32:57] that was there it was the blessing of
[1:33:00] god
[1:33:00] that was resting there upon the seed of
[1:33:03] god that was in their life
[1:33:06] brother they won rotten side songs
[1:33:11] you don't hear hound dogs in the
[1:33:12] background of these boys
[1:33:14] when they wrote they wrote songs of
[1:33:15] praise
[1:33:17] oh i had such a bad childhood oh this
[1:33:19] was done and out this was done
[1:33:21] and that was done that's true there's a
[1:33:23] lot of things of things of baggage
[1:33:25] and stuff that we can have but there's
[1:33:27] not one person here
[1:33:29] and i'll say it like this there's not a
[1:33:31] devil that can say
[1:33:32] that any of that is greater or that god
[1:33:35] can't take care of it
[1:33:36] god can take care of your past the god
[1:33:39] he knew about you before any of those
[1:33:42] things ever happened
[1:33:43] that same god can minister healing to
[1:33:46] your life
[1:33:46] maybe where trust was exploited in your
[1:33:49] life you have a living god
[1:33:51] who is present that lets you know i can
[1:33:54] restore
[1:33:55] trust in your heart
[1:34:00] hallelujah we have heard with our ears
[1:34:03] oh god
[1:34:05] our fathers have told us what work
[1:34:08] thou didst in their days in the times of
[1:34:12] old
[1:34:13] how thou didst drive out the heathen
[1:34:17] with a hand and plantest them
[1:34:20] how thou did is to flick the people
[1:34:23] and cast them out they talk about when
[1:34:26] they came in the land
[1:34:27] for they got not the land in possession
[1:34:30] by their own sword
[1:34:32] neither did their own arm save them
[1:34:36] but thy right hand and thine arm
[1:34:39] and the light of thy countenance because
[1:34:41] thou had us
[1:34:42] a favor unto them
[1:34:46] god made a promise
[1:34:49] before any of them were ever manifest
[1:34:52] god already had a promise
[1:34:53] before there was adam stardust or molly
[1:34:56] when he spoke to moses and let him know
[1:34:59] where they would be down in the land for
[1:35:00] 400 years
[1:35:01] but he said i'm going to visit them down
[1:35:02] there is that right
[1:35:05] i'm going to bring them up out of there
[1:35:06] and bring them into a landfill of milk
[1:35:08] and honey
[1:35:08] so god will always he fulfills his word
[1:35:12] through his believers now just just
[1:35:15] just a look at this here in the message
[1:35:17] proving his word
[1:35:18] brother brahman says you know he said
[1:35:20] it's only by the believers
[1:35:22] that he can prove his word he says no
[1:35:24] matter how much a person claims oh i
[1:35:26] believe it brother i believe it brother
[1:35:28] but he says it's by true believers that
[1:35:31] he proves
[1:35:32] his word not by those who say they
[1:35:34] believe
[1:35:35] but those who really believe it's by his
[1:35:39] believing
[1:35:39] children that he proves his word now he
[1:35:42] goes in to speak about the time of
[1:35:44] the ten spies and joshua and caleb he
[1:35:46] says now he had the believers
[1:35:48] the old crop had died off the
[1:35:50] unbelievers who said
[1:35:51] we can't take it he let every one of
[1:35:53] them perish every one of them but the
[1:35:55] believers
[1:35:56] who was left moses had been taken to
[1:35:58] glory
[1:35:59] and the unbelievers had perished in the
[1:36:01] wilderness and this was their children
[1:36:03] there were only two that crossed over
[1:36:05] and that was the believers
[1:36:06] joshua and caleb they was the believers
[1:36:10] they was the one
[1:36:11] who crossed over now listen the
[1:36:12] statement it's the only
[1:36:15] way god can do it is by
[1:36:18] his believing children god
[1:36:21] does not fulfill his word outside
[1:36:25] of his believing children
[1:36:29] so then what does that make his
[1:36:30] believing children if
[1:36:32] his word is a promise that has been
[1:36:34] given
[1:36:35] and designated for a generation then
[1:36:38] his believing children to receive that
[1:36:41] word and ignite something in their life
[1:36:44] and now it becomes an expression
[1:36:46] of the thought that was behind the word
[1:36:50] is that right let there be he said
[1:36:53] that's the only way god can do it
[1:36:55] is by his believing children his
[1:36:57] believers
[1:36:58] was the one that done it he used them to
[1:37:01] cross over with
[1:37:03] god used joshua and caleb to cross over
[1:37:06] with
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:11] now you might look at joshua and caleb
[1:37:13] let me just tell you something
[1:37:14] god specializes in using lives
[1:37:18] that are flawed and faulty
[1:37:22] just read it here again this morning
[1:37:23] brother graham says there are many many
[1:37:25] more that are faulty and flawed than are
[1:37:27] perfect
[1:37:30] he even said the messengers the seven
[1:37:32] stars that are in the right hand
[1:37:34] he said even to the human mind they
[1:37:36] might seem
[1:37:37] disqualified but god does not do it
[1:37:41] based on our thinking about things
[1:37:44] if you and i were choosing somebody to
[1:37:46] go stand before pharaoh's court
[1:37:48] we'd never chose somebody with a
[1:37:50] speaking issue
[1:37:52] we'd never put somebody with a
[1:37:54] stuttering problem
[1:37:55] with a slow tongue you had a one to find
[1:37:58] somebody
[1:37:58] to speak but god didn't need somebody to
[1:38:01] speak elegant words
[1:38:03] he needed a channel that would let god
[1:38:06] come on the scene
[1:38:07] and that's all god needs in your life
[1:38:10] it's a channel
[1:38:11] he don't need you to know everything
[1:38:12] perfectly well i gotta know how this
[1:38:14] fits here
[1:38:15] i got to know how this fits here that's
[1:38:17] not the purpose
[1:38:19] the purpose is that he might
[1:38:22] be manifest
[1:38:26] it seems like i can't remember this and
[1:38:28] i don't know how to put this together
[1:38:30] god's not interested in that
[1:38:33] there's people that can put all kinds of
[1:38:35] things together but yet they can't yield
[1:38:37] and hear the voice of god i'm talking
[1:38:39] about scripture
[1:38:40] you've got to be able to yield and hear
[1:38:43] the voice of god
[1:38:46] y'all hear what i'm saying it's one
[1:38:49] thing a person can listen to the message
[1:38:51] day in and day out
[1:38:52] they can read the scripture day in and
[1:38:53] day out and you cannot recognizing god
[1:38:55] coming down
[1:38:56] and speaking through vessels you know
[1:38:58] what it is
[1:38:59] they need a dose with a burning bush i'm
[1:39:02] gonna say it flat
[1:39:03] they need to meet the characteristic of
[1:39:06] god
[1:39:09] come on friends amen is to recognize
[1:39:13] god's voice is still speaking god is
[1:39:16] still sounding forth
[1:39:18] in it a paradox you don't have to
[1:39:19] convince nobody
[1:39:23] those that hear it do not convince them
[1:39:25] and you're not going to disprove it to
[1:39:27] them either
[1:39:29] they know the settlements down here they
[1:39:31] know his voice as it's speaking to him
[1:39:34] are you with me glory be to god so see
[1:39:37] that's what this message this message
[1:39:39] it came to reveal jesus christ
[1:39:42] it come that you might recognize him
[1:39:45] that you might be united with him
[1:39:47] to where when he would show up it may
[1:39:49] not be verbatim
[1:39:50] a quote but you would recognize because
[1:39:53] you identify
[1:39:54] the characteristic that he has been
[1:39:57] revealed
[1:39:58] to me and you recognize him are you
[1:40:01] hearing me
[1:40:02] that's that's where the life of god and
[1:40:04] the quickening power
[1:40:06] comes down
[1:40:09] oh my you know what i'm talking about
[1:40:11] i've heard people put you know
[1:40:13] coffee table quotes and these patched up
[1:40:15] stuff and i've heard them yeah well
[1:40:16] so-and-so said this and
[1:40:17] brother brown said this over here now
[1:40:19] look i don't know every quote in the
[1:40:20] message but i've got different brothers
[1:40:22] and different ones will say brother
[1:40:23] samuel uh this particular quote
[1:40:24] uh you know maybe they're in a meeting
[1:40:26] somewhere hey brother samuel this
[1:40:27] particular quote you you remember
[1:40:28] can you send me that quote right now
[1:40:29] i'll go back through it and general
[1:40:31] pulling it up from my mind and so forth
[1:40:32] i wish i could remember a whole lot more
[1:40:34] but it ain't about what you can remember
[1:40:36] but what i'm getting to is this right
[1:40:38] here
[1:40:38] brother joy there's things sometimes you
[1:40:39] hear and i look at and say that don't
[1:40:41] jive with the rest of the character
[1:40:44] somewhere along the line somebody said
[1:40:46] this to this to this to this to this to
[1:40:49] this
[1:40:49] and what you got is an ugly boogie man
[1:40:51] you don't have christ
[1:40:52] being revealed you've got somebody's
[1:40:54] little tweet and then touch here
[1:40:56] cut off here and cut off there but that
[1:40:58] is not what the bride of jesus christ
[1:41:00] is looking for brother you can't feed
[1:41:02] her on that nonsense
[1:41:04] the bride of jesus christ is built in
[1:41:06] the food of the
[1:41:07] hour brother it illuminates to our heart
[1:41:10] it's strength into our souls
[1:41:12] it builds faith muscles in our lives
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:16] hey what is it that's kept you
[1:41:18] throughout this whole time
[1:41:21] what is it that's put a boldness in your
[1:41:23] life
[1:41:24] come on friends i'm talking about in
[1:41:26] this hour
[1:41:28] what is it that's put of hair brother we
[1:41:31] are not where we were
[1:41:32] a year ago the church has moved up
[1:41:36] higher
[1:41:39] there's a greater boldness in the church
[1:41:41] of the living god
[1:41:42] there's a greater trust that's come in
[1:41:45] the church of the living god
[1:41:46] that god keeps every promise
[1:41:50] [Music]
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:56] hallelujah i feel glory flowing right
[1:42:00] now
[1:42:02] hallelujah he does it the same in every
[1:42:05] age
[1:42:06] the same method he has to take believers
[1:42:11] so in order to have believers just think
[1:42:13] of this
[1:42:14] to meet that word he's got to
[1:42:17] predestinate it to that age
[1:42:19] he's got to predestinate this thing to
[1:42:22] be there to meet the challenge
[1:42:24] of the age he said that's what we see
[1:42:26] happening
[1:42:27] today malachi 4
[1:42:30] was a promise that laid within the
[1:42:32] scripture
[1:42:34] different ones tried to tap into it
[1:42:36] alexander dowie and everything else
[1:42:38] all it did was brought a group of people
[1:42:40] together design illinois
[1:42:42] and they all come together and they're
[1:42:44] looking for elijah looking for this and
[1:42:46] looking for that
[1:42:47] but you see when god fulfills his word
[1:42:50] he doesn't need man's help
[1:42:54] if there's anything we can get driven
[1:42:56] out of our mind right now being an
[1:42:57] instrument
[1:42:58] this pair of glasses don't jump off the
[1:43:00] desk and say here
[1:43:01] samuel let me help you it's right here
[1:43:05] i've never had a screwdriver brother
[1:43:06] brian jump out of the box and say
[1:43:08] you need me right here
[1:43:12] god don't use people that say you need
[1:43:14] me
[1:43:16] amen are you with me that's a sure sign
[1:43:20] god is not going to use you you
[1:43:23] understand what i'm talking about
[1:43:24] so many people i want to be a preacher
[1:43:26] or i want to be of this and i want
[1:43:27] that's contrary
[1:43:30] that's contrary because everything that
[1:43:32] god has called you to do
[1:43:33] look you and i were looking look even in
[1:43:35] our own individual walk with god
[1:43:37] you and i were all about right out there
[1:43:39] in the world or maybe you might have
[1:43:40] been sitting in a church
[1:43:41] dead as a doornail but here you were
[1:43:43] going about your own way
[1:43:45] but there was something about it in the
[1:43:47] season and an hour
[1:43:48] of time that god knows the better time
[1:43:51] god knows the moment
[1:43:52] and there was things that you wonder why
[1:43:54] can't my life just go on like it was
[1:43:56] why is this bothering me because this is
[1:43:59] an hour
[1:44:00] that god is desiring for you to come
[1:44:04] forth
[1:44:10] hallelujah there's nothing
[1:44:14] no the critics could never stop malachi
[1:44:16] 4 from being fulfilled
[1:44:19] and god did it not within not with an
[1:44:22] intellectual
[1:44:23] educational man let me just say this to
[1:44:25] you intellectual doesn't altogether mean
[1:44:27] dry and everything else
[1:44:28] intellectual remember that's tied into
[1:44:30] even emotion
[1:44:32] are you with me but you see god didn't
[1:44:35] need
[1:44:35] intellects to do it god didn't god only
[1:44:37] god needed is a man
[1:44:39] that could surrender himself to him
[1:44:45] brother brown would stand there on the
[1:44:46] platform night after night
[1:44:49] and here were men behind him with
[1:44:50] doctor's degrees men
[1:44:52] that could explain scriptures
[1:44:56] men that could explain the word of god
[1:44:58] men that could sit that you sat down and
[1:45:00] they said we're going to have a bible
[1:45:01] study
[1:45:02] man they could take it back and forth
[1:45:03] back and forth back and forth and
[1:45:05] everything else
[1:45:06] god wasn't interested in that
[1:45:10] that will never serve the purpose of god
[1:45:11] unless that life has been yielded to god
[1:45:14] god had a man by the name of paul but
[1:45:15] paul said i had to get untied
[1:45:17] from every pain that i ever knew that is
[1:45:20] a very
[1:45:21] paradox of god where god can take a man
[1:45:24] that maybe god will bring that man
[1:45:25] out of pentecost or out of the baptist
[1:45:27] there's got to be such a uniting with
[1:45:29] god
[1:45:29] to where the only living of his thinking
[1:45:31] and his teaching
[1:45:32] is burnt from his life hey listen now
[1:45:35] there's many of us even in our lives
[1:45:37] to wear the spirit of almighty god even
[1:45:39] after it's burnt in your life
[1:45:41] you still deal with laying down things
[1:45:43] that you were taught
[1:45:44] in a baptist church or a pentecostal
[1:45:46] church or maybe even in a message church
[1:45:49] where things were taught in a certain
[1:45:51] way and you battle with that sometimes
[1:45:53] in your mind
[1:45:53] but let me tell you there's a liberating
[1:45:56] power of the holy ghost that
[1:45:58] sets you free and brings you right in
[1:46:00] there till you realize i don't have to
[1:46:02] do nothing
[1:46:03] all i've got to do is yield to him i
[1:46:06] have been accepted
[1:46:08] into beloved
[1:46:13] god don't need you walking around with a
[1:46:14] cat of nine tails
[1:46:17] he needs you to take that cat of nine
[1:46:18] tails and start whooping that devil
[1:46:22] stop beating yourself to death well i
[1:46:25] failed here i made a mistake there
[1:46:26] recognize god's grace that's given you
[1:46:29] grace to rise back
[1:46:30] up you're under a blood covenant
[1:46:33] and the blood works the blood speaks
[1:46:37] if you only let it speak to your life
[1:46:40] it'll drive away
[1:46:41] guilt it'll release pardoning power to
[1:46:44] your life
[1:46:47] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:46:51] but look what god's done in your life
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:47:01] you need to have a shamgar moment right
[1:47:06] now
[1:47:11] one little scripture in the bible
[1:47:13] shamgar
[1:47:14] but out that one little scripture
[1:47:15] brother aaron there was a mighty man who
[1:47:18] came to a point
[1:47:19] the spirit of god anointing his life
[1:47:21] it's enough
[1:47:24] not today shamgar could say
[1:47:28] you're at the wrong time wrong place
[1:47:31] and you picked with the wrong person
[1:47:33] come on now
[1:47:35] you need to let that devil know you're
[1:47:37] picking with the wrong person
[1:47:39] he might be bigger than your flesh but
[1:47:41] he's not bigger than the god inside of
[1:47:43] you
[1:47:47] god is greater than your problem god is
[1:47:50] greater than your circumstance
[1:47:52] god is bigger than the opposition say
[1:47:54] unto that mountain
[1:47:56] be thou moved plopped up and cast into
[1:47:59] your undersea
[1:48:01] hallelujah a channel that god is
[1:48:04] expressing his word through
[1:48:08] hallelujah whether you know it or not
[1:48:11] we're the mop-up crew
[1:48:16] our husband started it right there satan
[1:48:19] was kicked out
[1:48:21] from heaven
[1:48:25] down here on earth he was defeated at
[1:48:27] calvary
[1:48:30] our husband went down into the grave he
[1:48:32] took every sin
[1:48:33] that that rascal had ever inspired and
[1:48:36] he deposited it
[1:48:37] where it needs to go don't you let that
[1:48:39] liar put that on you
[1:48:41] that wasn't the real you
[1:48:46] hallelujah let it be where it is in the
[1:48:49] bleach of almighty god
[1:48:53] amen
[1:48:57] and he rose up on that easter morning
[1:48:59] triumphant
[1:49:01] over death hell and the grave
[1:49:06] he ascended back on high and sent back
[1:49:08] the same holy ghost
[1:49:09] and he sent it what into his body that
[1:49:12] he had redeemed what did he do
[1:49:14] he redeemed brother greg channels back
[1:49:17] to himself
[1:49:18] life this is what you and i were always
[1:49:20] we were always brother richie
[1:49:22] sons and daughters of god sister barb we
[1:49:25] were
[1:49:25] always that we didn't know it but god
[1:49:29] knew about it
[1:49:30] we couldn't even see it in ourselves but
[1:49:32] god
[1:49:33] saw it and the deep called to the deep
[1:49:37] at the knowledge of that waterspouts

[1:50:29] i don't know whether to go on or just
[1:50:30] stop reading god
[1:50:32] if you tell me to go on and then you
[1:50:34] leave me high and dry then you're gonna
[1:50:35] get it again
[1:50:39] amen i want you to look at this here
[1:50:41] just for a moment
[1:50:43] let me just try to move to some places
[1:50:44] here remember god's desire
[1:50:46] in psalms 80 verse 8 here david is
[1:50:49] speaking
[1:50:50] thou speaking to the lord thou hast
[1:50:53] brought a vine
[1:50:54] out of egypt thou hast cast out
[1:50:58] the heathen now remember what we read
[1:51:00] before in psalms 44
[1:51:01] thou didst cast him out thou did his
[1:51:03] plan but how did he do it
[1:51:05] through believers how did god do it
[1:51:08] for believers is that right
[1:51:12] notice thou has cast out the heathen and
[1:51:14] planted it
[1:51:15] thou preparest room before it and did
[1:51:18] cause it to take deep root and fill and
[1:51:19] it
[1:51:20] filled the land the hills were covered
[1:51:21] with shadow of it the bulls thereof were
[1:51:23] like goodly cedars
[1:51:24] and she sent out her bows into the sea
[1:51:26] and her branches unto the river
[1:51:28] speaking of israel israel was a vine
[1:51:32] that was down in egypt and god
[1:51:35] came down and brought them out of egypt
[1:51:38] when they were in egypt they were a vine
[1:51:41] but they could not
[1:51:42] reflect what they really were
[1:51:47] you see they weren't in the homeland
[1:51:50] they weren't in the choice ground they
[1:51:53] were always of high
[1:51:54] you were always the son and daughter of
[1:51:56] god
[1:51:58] but here here here here is here is here
[1:52:01] is this
[1:52:02] this part of the planting of almighty
[1:52:04] god and notice
[1:52:05] that it had to be brought into the
[1:52:07] ordained place
[1:52:09] because there is fruit predestinated
[1:52:12] fruit that is to be born
[1:52:15] by that predestinated vine
[1:52:19] now i want you just to look at this here
[1:52:20] just for a moment god speaks in isaiah
[1:52:23] 5 of how the planning of this vineyard
[1:52:26] now
[1:52:26] in isaiah 5 1 now will i sing to my
[1:52:29] beloved a song of my beloved
[1:52:31] touching his vineyard my beloved hath a
[1:52:33] vineyard
[1:52:34] in a very fruitful hill so it is
[1:52:36] positioned very well
[1:52:38] and he fenced it what what is the what
[1:52:41] is the protection
[1:52:42] of the church of the living god the word
[1:52:45] is that right he fenced it and gathered
[1:52:48] out
[1:52:48] the stones thereof see god's a gardener
[1:52:51] the very first thing you ever read
[1:52:52] planted is the bible says god planted a
[1:52:55] garden
[1:52:56] god is a gardener one of the things that
[1:52:59] he uses
[1:53:00] and he he took out the stones why
[1:53:01] hindrances
[1:53:03] he removes hindrances in your life are
[1:53:06] you with me
[1:53:08] and he planted it with the choicest vine
[1:53:11] and built a tower in the midst of it and
[1:53:13] also made
[1:53:14] a wine press no what's a tower it's a
[1:53:16] place that can be
[1:53:18] watched where there are things that can
[1:53:20] be see what's approaching
[1:53:22] you see when god planted this vine he
[1:53:25] took great care
[1:53:26] to place it in the right place he also
[1:53:29] took good care
[1:53:30] to fence it around bring the protection
[1:53:32] that was needed
[1:53:33] he took out all the stones all the
[1:53:35] hindrances he what's he doing he's
[1:53:37] opening up the channels
[1:53:39] that all of that that is there within
[1:53:41] the ground because you know a plant if
[1:53:43] there's rocks underneath the soil
[1:53:44] and some of you probably did this before
[1:53:46] but you know sometimes when you go to
[1:53:48] plant grass
[1:53:49] there was a place where we had built
[1:53:50] that other house i planted grass
[1:53:52] and every time when brother when there
[1:53:53] was a drought like coming up
[1:53:55] right there in that one particular patch
[1:53:57] i'd forget about it when fall come
[1:53:59] but right there that grass would die and
[1:54:01] you know what you'd see
[1:54:02] you'd see a rock laying right there
[1:54:04] right faintly underneath it
[1:54:06] the grass would burn back off of it
[1:54:07] because the root can go
[1:54:09] but eventually it hits a rock and the
[1:54:11] rock is not
[1:54:12] meant for the root to bed in and so god
[1:54:15] himself
[1:54:16] he takes out he removes all the stones
[1:54:18] you see what god does
[1:54:20] god places you and i into a place
[1:54:23] where we are able to fully enjoy
[1:54:26] ourselves and yield and bring forth what
[1:54:30] god is intending for us to do
[1:54:33] hallelujah and he builds a tower
[1:54:36] that we that it might be in the midst of
[1:54:38] and also a wine press because they're
[1:54:39] going to be fruit
[1:54:41] are you with me this isn't just one
[1:54:43] batch of fruit
[1:54:46] just one batch of grapes don't produce
[1:54:48] this kind of drunkenness
[1:54:52] this is why the bible said in
[1:54:53] revelations 10 8-11
[1:54:56] and thou must prophesy again
[1:54:59] all right to many people's kindreds
[1:55:02] nations and tongues
[1:55:03] you see god the very characteristic of
[1:55:05] god is still
[1:55:06] speaking and the word again means a
[1:55:09] cycle
[1:55:10] it means that very word right there it
[1:55:12] means a cycle where you plant a crop it
[1:55:14] you crop you harvest the crop but out of
[1:55:17] that crop you sow that
[1:55:18] what's happening it is not a decrease
[1:55:20] we're not living in a decrease
[1:55:22] we're living in the hour where the
[1:55:24] floors are
[1:55:25] filled with the oil and the wine and the
[1:55:28] fats of god
[1:55:30] we're not living in a time of famine for
[1:55:32] the believer
[1:55:33] this is a time brother where we are fat
[1:55:36] as calves at a stall
[1:55:40] glory be to god we're not deprived we're
[1:55:43] not waiting on the next sunday school
[1:55:44] pamphlet to drop in
[1:55:49] we're not waiting on somebody to send
[1:55:51] down a notification of what tape we're
[1:55:53] supposed to listen to
[1:55:54] we are legals of god
[1:56:01] hallelujah amen oh my we know in whom we
[1:56:04] have believed
[1:56:05] and we're persuaded that he is able to
[1:56:08] keep that which we've committed against
[1:56:09] today
[1:56:10] now think of this here israel was in a
[1:56:12] natural land
[1:56:14] given by god this is part we're looking
[1:56:16] at it very much it types
[1:56:19] into the part where you and i are are
[1:56:22] out in this in this time in this hour
[1:56:24] you and i
[1:56:24] were in a place that was a away away
[1:56:28] from god
[1:56:29] where we needed to be but israel being
[1:56:31] in a natural land all this was laid out
[1:56:33] in types
[1:56:34] that god indeed himself would bring down
[1:56:38] not a vine from earth but a vine from
[1:56:40] glory
[1:56:42] and that vine from glory will be
[1:56:43] revealed in a glorious branch
[1:56:49] but israel by being in a natural land
[1:56:53] they would come under a place that they
[1:56:56] would come to a spot
[1:56:58] where god as we read here in psalms 80
[1:57:00] where david
[1:57:01] is is crying out to god that god would
[1:57:04] return
[1:57:06] and that he would look down from heaven
[1:57:08] behold
[1:57:09] and visit them they had come to a spot
[1:57:12] to where
[1:57:13] here they were they were removed from
[1:57:16] their natural land or we'll say it like
[1:57:18] this
[1:57:18] they were still dwelling in israel but
[1:57:21] yet it was as if they were back in egypt
[1:57:25] are you with me now amen all because of
[1:57:28] one thing
[1:57:30] they failed to listen and obey
[1:57:34] the voice of god
[1:57:38] let me just let me just read this this
[1:57:39] scripture here to you i don't know how
[1:57:41] much longer it will be
[1:57:42] i'm not going to keep you all day don't
[1:57:43] worry but hosea 10 1.
[1:57:47] israel look what god speaks of then
[1:57:51] israel is an empty vine he bringeth
[1:57:54] forth
[1:57:55] fruit unto himself
[1:57:59] he was a vine a channel but he's not
[1:58:02] bringing forth fruit
[1:58:04] unto god this is fruit
[1:58:07] unto himself according to the multitude
[1:58:11] of his fruit he has
[1:58:12] increased the altars according to the
[1:58:13] goodness of his land
[1:58:15] they have made goodly images their heart
[1:58:18] is divided so now god is identifying why
[1:58:22] that fruit is not coming forth their
[1:58:25] heart
[1:58:26] is divided now shall they be found
[1:58:29] faulty he shall break down their altars
[1:58:32] and he shall spoil
[1:58:33] their image let me just let me just let
[1:58:36] me just say
[1:58:37] mention this here
[1:58:41] when we look at their heart being
[1:58:42] divided
[1:58:44] just a little bit of a
[1:58:47] pastoral mode here very much so
[1:58:51] you realize that in your life
[1:58:55] you can't live between two desires you
[1:58:58] can't live
[1:58:58] you have a desire to serve god but
[1:59:00] there's desires out here in this flesh
[1:59:03] you can't live between them you've got
[1:59:05] to let
[1:59:07] the desire of god have the right
[1:59:11] you have to let that come to the right
[1:59:13] away let god come
[1:59:15] and raise up what is just a potential
[1:59:18] and let it be a reality
[1:59:20] and after god has done that feed that
[1:59:22] desire
[1:59:24] because remember you got because after
[1:59:26] that has come it's white dog
[1:59:28] black dog are you with me you can't live
[1:59:31] between two desires you've got to
[1:59:33] feed the right desire is that right
[1:59:37] sometimes feeding feeding the wrong
[1:59:40] desire
[1:59:40] is simply neglecting to feed the right
[1:59:45] stay with me the other part
[1:59:48] it can't be halting between two opinions
[1:59:51] is this right or is it not right
[1:59:55] you see god specializes he didn't ask
[1:59:57] you to resolve that
[1:59:59] but you invite god like elijah invited
[2:00:02] invited god on mount carmel at his word
[2:00:05] remember what
[2:00:06] what elijah did he said i've done this
[2:00:08] at thy word
[2:00:09] god has given us his word he said ask
[2:00:11] the father anything in my name and
[2:00:13] i will do it he said seek and you shall
[2:00:16] find
[2:00:18] ask and it shall be given to you knock
[2:00:19] and it shall be open
[2:00:21] he said he'll give the holy ghost to
[2:00:23] those who ask him
[2:00:24] for it you see god has provided a way
[2:00:28] so you don't have to be between two
[2:00:30] opinions
[2:00:32] so you don't have to wonder am i a child
[2:00:34] of god or am i not a child of god
[2:00:37] come on now god has a way
[2:00:40] of of resolving that so that and there
[2:00:44] can't be a life
[2:00:46] that's halfway right you can't be a
[2:00:49] halfway life a
[2:00:50] part-time christian and this god don't
[2:00:53] god don't use part-time people
[2:00:56] i mean the jobs nowadays they'd be happy
[2:00:59] to get a one-hour person to work
[2:01:03] right i mean people are making more
[2:01:05] money staying home than they are working
[2:01:08] hey these are things that i go into the
[2:01:09] stores and people are telling me
[2:01:12] but you see god can't use anything
[2:01:13] that's part time
[2:01:17] god will use what you give him
[2:01:22] you'll use what you're giving but don't
[2:01:25] you want him
[2:01:26] don't you want to give him everything
[2:01:28] amen
[2:01:30] well lord i'll really serve you when i
[2:01:32] let me tell you something sometimes you
[2:01:34] hear people say well when i retire i'll
[2:01:35] really serve god
[2:01:37] you're lying you won't do it if you
[2:01:40] can't do it right now
[2:01:41] in a time in your busiest time you won't
[2:01:44] do it then
[2:01:45] it's about priority
[2:01:50] it's priorities and things come on
[2:01:53] friends
[2:01:54] this is a reality i'm not here to try to
[2:01:56] hurt your feelings but maybe they do
[2:01:57] need to be heard
[2:01:58] god don't want lip service
[2:02:02] brother samuel that was such an
[2:02:03] uplifting message it's still an
[2:02:05] uplifting message
[2:02:06] because it's a spirit of god trying to
[2:02:09] minister
[2:02:10] to our lives to make sure that
[2:02:12] everything
[2:02:13] is cut away amen amen
[2:02:17] israel was in a choice place
[2:02:21] very nothing you could say with the
[2:02:24] church they were in i mean where they
[2:02:25] were positioned in that fruitful hill
[2:02:28] didn't say nothing well lord i would i
[2:02:30] would be
[2:02:32] i would be lord if you if i was under so
[2:02:34] and so if they were my pastor lord or
[2:02:36] if i was under servants over here if i
[2:02:37] was under so and so over there
[2:02:39] or if i was over here oh lord if i that
[2:02:41] sounds like the same thing where people
[2:02:43] said if i was back in the days of noah
[2:02:45] if you can't recognize god here
[2:02:48] you wouldn't recognize god back there
[2:02:52] the same way you respond to right now or
[2:02:54] lack of you'd have done the same thing
[2:02:56] then
[2:02:58] come on somebody you'd have been the
[2:03:01] same person
[2:03:01] that would show up to the ark and say
[2:03:03] wow y'all got a lot done while i was
[2:03:05] gone
[2:03:07] preach brother samuel come on now
[2:03:11] you see it's to be laboring it's to be
[2:03:15] yielding to god remember there's a
[2:03:16] purpose for every age
[2:03:19] the church is not going to carry it on
[2:03:20] their back
[2:03:22] daddy ain't going to carry it on his
[2:03:23] back every life
[2:03:25] has a purpose that the life of jesus
[2:03:29] christ
[2:03:29] might be reflected in an overcoming life
[2:03:33] amen is that right hey listen there's a
[2:03:36] devil
[2:03:37] there's not going to be one devil when
[2:03:39] the bride is taken from off of this
[2:03:41] earth there will not be one devil
[2:03:42] that will be able to raise its head and
[2:03:44] say
[2:03:46] you didn't overcome me right through a
[2:03:48] mini-membered body
[2:03:51] the spirit of god right through lies
[2:03:55] lives to where society says you're born
[2:03:57] like this
[2:03:58] this can never be changed in your life
[2:04:00] you let them meet jesus christ one time
[2:04:02] you don't change them and make a real
[2:04:04] man out of them it'll make a real lady
[2:04:06] out of them it'll change their desire
[2:04:09] it'll change their nature it'll take a
[2:04:11] man who's an adulterer
[2:04:12] and a whoremonger a drunk and everything
[2:04:15] else and it will so
[2:04:16] change that man on the inside what does
[2:04:19] that not a church
[2:04:20] a church can't do that putting your name
[2:04:22] on a book can't do that but when you
[2:04:24] meet
[2:04:25] jesus christ the pillar fire he will
[2:04:28] change your life
[2:04:29] [Applause]
[2:04:34] double-mindedness double-minded
[2:04:39] the bible says don't let a man if he
[2:04:42] asks god for anything
[2:04:44] be it he's double-minded about it don't
[2:04:46] let him think you'll get
[2:04:48] be certain of it how could i be certain
[2:04:51] of
[2:04:52] it because god said it and the god who
[2:04:54] said it is the god inspiring you to
[2:04:56] speak it
[2:04:58] hallelujah you talking about backup
[2:05:02] brother i was going down the road the
[2:05:04] other night going home

[2:05:07] what was going on fire truck and
[2:05:08] everything was out here
[2:05:09] on that one road that goes by i don't
[2:05:11] remember whatever anyhow that that road
[2:05:13] i mean there was like about six cop cars
[2:05:16] behind there
[2:05:17] i thought man a lot of it must be a real
[2:05:18] big fire there and we got by and my wife
[2:05:20] said
[2:05:20] you see that guy they were putting him
[2:05:22] in handcuffs i said no i didn't see
[2:05:23] cause i had to watch the road the curve
[2:05:24] was right here
[2:05:25] but then man they had like six or seven
[2:05:27] people of course you can't blame them
[2:05:28] nowadays
[2:05:29] but they had like six or seven cops
[2:05:30] pulled out there on cars let me tell you
[2:05:32] something brother and sister

[2:05:39] the holy spirit
[2:05:41] is the enforcer that is on the job of
[2:05:43] duty right now
[2:05:44] to back that word up and to make it come
[2:05:47] to pass in your
[2:05:48] life he's there to back up every fear
[2:05:50] and every doubt to rent it out of your
[2:05:52] life to where you can stand there
[2:05:53] and say i don't know how but i know that
[2:05:56] i know that i know that i know
[2:05:58] i know this is god's promise for me
[2:06:01] [Applause]

[2:06:23] your phone with my whole heart oh god
[2:06:25] with my whole heart over with my whole
[2:06:28] heart oh god
[2:06:30] sometimes things can even get built up
[2:06:32] in our heart now i'm talking about even
[2:06:33] after our heart has been completely
[2:06:35] turned and surrendered to god sometimes
[2:06:38] there's things that can be kind of heavy
[2:06:40] things can build up even even fear can
[2:06:42] set in
[2:06:44] doubt and other things like that i can't
[2:06:45] get into all that today but things can
[2:06:47] try to set up right there
[2:06:48] in the heart i just thought about that
[2:06:50] brother andrew touched on this on
[2:06:51] on friday night things can start to set
[2:06:54] up within those channels
[2:06:56] and i think he brought it back to
[2:06:58] talking about arteries if i'm not
[2:06:59] mistaken arteries in the
[2:07:01] in the body what a good thing how to
[2:07:02] describe that just how brother brandon
[2:07:04] went through that part of it
[2:07:05] of a pulsation sometimes you see the
[2:07:08] bible says
[2:07:08] as a man thinking and his heart's so
[2:07:12] easy
[2:07:13] you know it's hard for you to it's hard
[2:07:15] for you to go into a fight
[2:07:17] and thinking you're unable to do it
[2:07:21] you go into a fighter you go into a let
[2:07:24] me say i'm not a fighter i know some of
[2:07:25] you better
[2:07:27] you may not put on boxing gloves
[2:07:31] whoo but you can't go into a match
[2:07:36] with doubt you talk to him then them
[2:07:39] guys some of them guys are
[2:07:41] boxers and things like that muhammad ali
[2:07:43] when he would go into a fight
[2:07:45] he never walked into a fight with the
[2:07:46] doubt matter of fact he told him what
[2:07:48] was going to happen
[2:07:49] i'm going to knock you out is that right
[2:07:53] and he got right in their ear and told
[2:07:55] them some people bit ears but he told
[2:07:57] them in their ear
[2:07:59] is that right there was a part about it
[2:08:01] they did not go in there
[2:08:03] thinking i might not come out a winner
[2:08:05] they went in there knowing
[2:08:06] i'm a winner right now when they stood
[2:08:10] in the fiery furnace
[2:08:11] they let the king know i'm on the
[2:08:13] winning side right now
[2:08:15] just because you're putting me through
[2:08:17] just because i'm in this test
[2:08:19] i'm in this trial that ain't no sign i'm
[2:08:22] defeated
[2:08:23] that ain't no sign god's against me
[2:08:26] i'm on the winning side i'm more than a
[2:08:29] conqueror
[2:08:30] you can look that devil in the face and
[2:08:32] say you already defeated
[2:08:38] hallelujah i'm on the winning side
[2:08:42] oh my the spirit of god begins to move
[2:08:46] through the channels of almighty god
[2:08:52] hallelujah jeremiah said it like this
[2:08:54] when israel
[2:08:55] would come back into the homeland he
[2:08:58] said
[2:08:59] god said through jeremiah when you seek
[2:09:01] me with your whole heart
[2:09:03] i'll be found of you then
[2:09:06] hallelujah amen a little sister stood
[2:09:10] right here
[2:09:11] last week it came to that place within
[2:09:14] her life

[2:09:48] [Music]
[2:09:49] we ain't serving a god that where you
[2:09:51] got to pump the people up
[2:09:52] it's the word of god that has an effect
[2:09:55] in our life
[2:10:01] there's one desire we have and that's to
[2:10:03] see him glorified
[2:10:05] he said when you seek me with all your
[2:10:06] heart then i'll bring you back that's an
[2:10:08] expected end
[2:10:15] as we come through this land
[2:10:19] what did he tell joshua
[2:10:23] stay right with the law of moses
[2:10:28] see what god gave right there god said
[2:10:32] i'm not going to alter it this is why
[2:10:36] when we read malachi 4 we do not just
[2:10:38] start with a fifth verse
[2:10:40] we start with verse four remember ye the
[2:10:43] law
[2:10:43] of moses what god has started
[2:10:47] where he would bring a people out and
[2:10:49] bring them fully in
[2:10:51] are you with me what was the type there
[2:10:55] now the antitype where the believer is
[2:10:58] coming
[2:10:58] fully into christ where the bride body
[2:11:01] she's not in the feet she's not in the
[2:11:03] shins not in the thighs
[2:11:05] not in the body not in the neck here the
[2:11:07] head has come to the body
[2:11:09] the eyes have come to that body and the
[2:11:11] intelligence the mind of christ
[2:11:13] has set down in the body now we are the
[2:11:17] sons and daughters of god
[2:11:19] amen hallelujah
[2:11:24] glory be to god you love him
[2:11:29] planted them in a choice place a choice
[2:11:32] place
[2:11:34] choice place god provided all they had
[2:11:36] needed
[2:11:38] all they had to do was bear fruit you
[2:11:41] see it brings us
[2:11:42] to this this place is that
[2:11:45] when brother branham makes a statement
[2:11:47] and you remember he preaches the message
[2:11:49] how can i overcome and he's looking at
[2:11:53] he goes back to a tree that he seen
[2:11:55] laying
[2:11:57] across a stream of water brother brown
[2:12:00] went to
[2:12:00] you know jump onto that tree and when he
[2:12:03] jumped on it
[2:12:04] a chunk of the tree fell off
[2:12:09] and brother brahma he takes the
[2:12:10] inspiration god inspires him to look at
[2:12:13] that and recognize
[2:12:17] he said that's the way that many
[2:12:19] christians
[2:12:20] watch what he says christians have
[2:12:23] become
[2:12:24] he said they've been dead in sin and
[2:12:25] trespasses
[2:12:27] so long though they cannot bear any way
[2:12:30] or any pressure
[2:12:32] and you remember as brother ramble bring
[2:12:34] that message he deals with
[2:12:35] lives that make us start but there's
[2:12:39] there must be a going on into full
[2:12:42] perfection is that right so i want you
[2:12:45] to think of this
[2:12:47] jesus said if you abide in me
[2:12:50] and my words abide in you ask
[2:12:54] what you will and it shall be done
[2:12:58] this tree it's a tree
[2:13:01] god's liking you and me to trees it was
[2:13:03] a tree brother brian it was in the right
[2:13:05] source
[2:13:06] it was in water but it was positioned
[2:13:09] wrong it it water it needs water
[2:13:14] but it was laying down in it instead of
[2:13:17] abiding in it god's intended
[2:13:22] every life maybe there's a life here
[2:13:24] this morning and you don't know him
[2:13:26] but god's intended maybe it's laid
[2:13:28] around church for years
[2:13:30] but god's intended for your life to be
[2:13:32] upright
[2:13:34] to be an upright to be planted by him
[2:13:36] god just don't want you laying in the
[2:13:38] water
[2:13:39] god just don't want you around the
[2:13:40] message amen
[2:13:42] listen it's all good because the message
[2:13:44] will it'll give life but
[2:13:45] you've got to receive it and allow
[2:13:48] allow the spirit of god to plant you
[2:13:51] you've got to welcome god and say well
[2:13:53] you know i've been here all these years
[2:13:54] and nothing's taken place and i but
[2:13:56] listen cast that aside
[2:13:59] cast what has been and let it be a has
[2:14:02] been
[2:14:03] and let the spirit of god take a hold
[2:14:05] right here this morning
[2:14:06] and he can take where you're laying down
[2:14:09] and here you are laying in the water he
[2:14:11] can take your life and he can plant you
[2:14:13] right here this morning he can plant you
[2:14:15] in a choice ground you say brother
[2:14:17] samuel i believe that
[2:14:18] then why don't you just reach out and
[2:14:20] make it yours this morning
[2:14:22] why don't you just make it your own and
[2:14:24] say lord i don't want to lay down in the
[2:14:26] stream no more
[2:14:27] i want to be planted lord i i look
[2:14:29] around and i
[2:14:30] i see the fruit of god being made
[2:14:32] manifest and there's a desire
[2:14:34] within my life you see god don't want
[2:14:36] you trying to satisfy
[2:14:38] that desire with all the pleasures of
[2:14:40] the world because it leaves you empty
[2:14:42] drains your bank account puts stress on
[2:14:44] your life that's not what god desires
[2:14:46] for you
[2:14:47] there's only one place of satisfaction
[2:14:49] and that
[2:14:50] is in jesus christ a church will never
[2:14:53] do it you can come to church here
[2:14:55] for months and months and years and
[2:14:57] years and still
[2:14:58] never be satisfied but if you'll ever
[2:15:01] let go
[2:15:01] and finally say i cast aside all of my
[2:15:04] religious garments
[2:15:06] all of my knowledge all of this and lord
[2:15:08] i'm asking that you
[2:15:10] plant me lord oh

[2:15:21] lacking in this ground this ground is
[2:15:24] not
[2:15:24] bad soil that's lacking a certain ph
[2:15:27] this god this gospel this soil
[2:15:30] it has every vitamin every nutrient
[2:15:33] that's needed for this hour that every
[2:15:36] what the seeds of god
[2:15:38] the vine of god needs in this hour to
[2:15:41] live in overcoming life
[2:15:42] it's in jesus christ and those that are
[2:15:46] tapped in

[2:20:17] use it
[2:20:18] lord jesus that's how i want to be
[2:20:23] lord god i want to be there lord jesus
[2:20:25] at any moment
[2:20:27] sometimes lord with things of life
[2:20:30] circumstances that could come
[2:20:33] or this is where we die daily
[2:20:36] this is where it times the lord as you
[2:20:38] will take the branch and you will purge
[2:20:40] it
[2:20:41] with tests trials
[2:20:44] lord jesus we want to be yielded
[2:20:48] to you lord help us lord
[2:20:52] we realize lord that yielding to you

[2:21:03] jesus it listen lord
[2:21:04] for many lord of your children as
[2:21:06] they're sitting here lord it isn't dear

[2:21:10] it isn't lord that they don't take time
[2:21:12] to spend with you and spend in your word
[2:21:15] but sometimes lord just the very simple
[2:21:17] things that
[2:21:18] could be designated as harmless
[2:21:21] but then it becomes harmful
[2:21:25] it begins to take away begins to get in
[2:21:27] the way

[2:21:48] god
[2:21:49] may we as paul said work out your own
[2:21:52] salvation
[2:21:53] with fear and trembling
[2:21:56] [Music]

[2:21:59] distrust
[2:22:00] one's own ability
[2:22:04] may we lord god just so rest in you help
[2:22:08] us lord

[2:23:22] him i desire
[2:23:24] more of him in my life there's
[2:23:27] more there's more of him i want and i
[2:23:28] know what that means is there's got to
[2:23:30] be less of samuel
[2:23:32] there's got to be less of samuel and you
[2:23:34] know what
[2:23:35] for the great god allows things to come
[2:23:37] my way allows things to come your way
[2:23:39] and god gives us opportunities brother
[2:23:41] carlos so that we can
[2:23:43] die to ourselves god knows we need to
[2:23:46] die more to ourselves so god brings us
[2:23:48] to those place
[2:23:49] this is why tests and trials come tested
[2:23:52] trials are not our enemy
[2:23:54] but he said we are killed all the day
[2:23:56] long
[2:23:57] for thy sake we are led to the slaughter
[2:24:00] that the life
[2:24:01] of jesus might be made manifest in our
[2:24:03] mortal body
[2:24:04] aren't you glad for intestine trials it
[2:24:07] might be one of the first services
[2:24:08] you've ever said glory to god
[2:24:10] for testing trials because you recognize
[2:24:12] its tests and trials
[2:24:14] it's the very aid of almighty god to
[2:24:17] come to you and i
[2:24:18] to help us to die more to ourselves
[2:24:22] we come into places where we realize i
[2:24:24] can't solve this problem
[2:24:25] i can't make this go away i can't move
[2:24:27] within this right here
[2:24:28] and all the while what god is desiring
[2:24:30] to do is mold more and more
[2:24:32] of his very character in our life
[2:24:37] hallelujah oh my let me just tell you
[2:24:39] something the trial never came to bind
[2:24:41] you
[2:24:42] i mean i'm trying to stop preaching the
[2:24:44] trial never came to bind you
[2:24:46] the test never came to bind you but
[2:24:48] remember the tests and trials
[2:24:50] are only there as the fire was on the
[2:24:53] ropes that held
[2:24:54] the hands of the hebrew children the
[2:24:56] test and the trial
[2:24:57] is only fire that's meant to lose what
[2:25:00] god has there inside of your life
[2:25:02] it didn't come to destroy you it come to
[2:25:04] remove what was hindering your life
[2:25:07] hallelujah it's more precious than gold

[2:25:14] highest
