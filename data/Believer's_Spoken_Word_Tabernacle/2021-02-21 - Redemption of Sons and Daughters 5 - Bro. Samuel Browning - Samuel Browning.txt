he cares very greatly for every need i'm glad about that aren't you amen he's not an onlooker he's not one who's just looking on brother branham would take that and out of the sumerian age jesus would say i know i know i know your labor i know the tribulation and he said to just a casual reader they would look at that and think as though he's an onlooker but he's not he's right there walking in the midst of his church he's right there in the midst of our lives doesn't matter times that you can feel him and there's times that you don't this is where faith comes in right it's for faith to know

to worship him who is the word amen heavenly father lord it's just such a privilege and an honor lord to serve you lord as you continue to express this to us lord as you even spoke that lord on thursday night to us we are not a christian by our own desire we're a christian by your desire lord it was not us who was seeking for you it was you that came seeking for us lord oh god as we see that parallel with david's life it was not david seeking to be king was not david seeking to be anointed but god it was you that sought david out you let it be known that you lord had sought him out even when samuel was standing there talking to saul david didn't know about that conversation but god that conversation of what was had there it came to him and i'm lord looking right now perhaps some of us lord as we stand some that stand by age they were here in the time lord where this message was going forth but dear god to recognize our names were wrote here in this bible lord in this word in the character of christ to be revealed in this hour and lord you came and you sought us out lord some of us lord somewhere in churches lord god and lord just as far as what lord could be known of you at that time but you came and sought us out some lord oh god just lord out in the world out in the world and other places lord lives oh god that lord society and everyone else would have rode off but you came below god there was a word lord god that you had spoken lord father clear back from the foundation of the world and you declared it in this generation that there is a crop that's to come forth in this hour lord a word that has been sowed o god that the spirit has come to raise it up lord we give you glory we pray that you would just lord come in a very personal way this morning lord i i've studied just lord just giving myself lord to you meditation lord just things lord that you've placed upon my heart now i just asked that you would help me to get outside help me to step out of the way and father as a congregation that we'll just be able to come aside lord that you'll just speak to our hearts in a personal way that father you'll just come and move lord for every need that's gathered here this morning lord we pray come and minister your word to our hearts and lord for every need upon the hearts of your children will you just come lord just minister to each one we pray in a special way in jesus precious name amen amen god bless you i want to look here in the scripture i want to go to ephesians 1. in ephesians 1 verse verse 3. here's paul writing blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love so we are chosen in him and he is the word we are chosen according that we should be holy and without blame before him in love so in this whole choosing to bring it about it's all a work of redemption it's his work to bring us into this place to where there is absolutely no charge against us now if the old man is still there then there's still a charge the old man can be forgiven but never come to this place of really being justified but you see once it comes this right here is a creation of god to bring us back into himself to where it's no longer the old man there's a new man and so the one who did it no longer is alive and living there there's a new man a new creation amen and we stand before him justified having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will through the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ may god bless you bless the word as you're being seated this inheritance as we as we've been looking at this and taking that word an inheritance it's something that belongs to you it's not something that you were to receive or even to go after as though it doesn't belong to you but you it is what god has has already designated before the foundation of the world it's that of himself that of his genes of his children that were in him and he is the word that inheritance is that you and i would come back to be a son and daughter of god not just not just one that is uh of acclaiming but where it is a real reality to where just as you are and myself manifestation of our earthly parents and it's not something that we're doing but it's it's it's it's a manifestation of their uh between father and mother it is the same with god that we would come into that inheritance that that seed as we've spoke about that what god placed within us that choosing from before the foundation of the world now as we come into this earth as soon as we come from our mother there and breathing that breath of life god has placed that seed within us it was there within us the whole time but it was as paul would write it was dead it was as it was the seed it was not living it was that part that was waiting for the spirit of god to come upon it to quicken it to make it alive the spirit of god is what coming upon the seed it is that which then begins to unfold our inheritance what really belongs to us in other words the life that we should have had you and i could not get back to that life after the fall but he himself who is the tree of life came to you and i he came and made a way that we could come back into the glory of being sons and daughters of god he made a way and so the inheritance that we are called back to is that of a sonship to be a son and daughter of god and this is where what we've been looking at is that redemption of sons and daughters of god because it's to operate it's with that reality in our heart that then puts us in a place of operating by perfect faith it puts us in a place that when we're praying about things and you don't know which way to turn you don't know which way to go you're in a place as brother branham would say in perfect faith then you're in position to receive faith you're in a place to where you know these these are the rights and privileges as a son and daughter of god and lord i don't know what's going to take place or how it's going to take place but i'm going to stand here upon your word because you are true and as david said thou hast exalted thy word above thy name you see it's the word being revealed that reveals his name amen the word is his nature his characteristics his essence it's who he is it reveals him to be the same yesterday today and forever if there's something that is proclaimed as the name of the lord and it does not line with the rest of the scripture that is not the name of the lord the name of the lord is a strong and mighty tower it's a place of safety it's a reality it's him it is the word so if the name is proclaimed and it's not in line with the word it's not the name being proclaimed so the name is not just me and you saying the lord jesus christ but the word being ministered declares the lord jesus christ that he's the same yesterday today and forever that's why creeds will never ever bring the reality of jesus christ on the scene that's why dogmas can't do it it takes the very person of christ himself who is the word to come into the word and declare his name and when he declares his name that's a fulfillment of him walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and declaring victory the name preached never declares defeat it declares victory it declares there's nothing can stand before him because he is the mighty conqueror and this is the inheritance that we're called to because we are called by that same name we're called by a name that is a name of victory the name of a mighty conqueror this is our family name when that name is preached we turn as in the beginning before eve ever had her own name the bible says he called their name adam we turn to that word we heed to that name this is we walk in that name this is why the scripture said in everything you do let it all be done in the name of jesus christ this name means something to you and i it's this name that calls devils to tremble hallelujah it's not just to have have a name but to have the life of that name he who makes that name and declares it that he's not just a god of 2000 years ago it's not a jesus of 2000 years ago it's the same jesus right here this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah and we're called by that name inheritance as a son and daughter of god that we can use that name hallelujah as we approach we approach in the name of the lord jesus christ my goodness verse 13 that was free in whom notice how paul goes on in whom ye also trusted you see this is very very simple and i want to just just see how the lord will just take it but be very diligent with it in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth you can't trust until you first hear the word of truth notice it's not the word of a man this is the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance so we're talking about that inheritance the earnest of it is we come back to being sons and daughters of god the holy spirit by the new birth is the down payment it's that change that happens inwardly in our life that changes us and that change leads us to the change of the body which is the full redemption which is to receive the full inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory so it's the spirit of truth in second thessalonians 2 13 the spirit of truth reveals the path to glory and i'll say it very clearly this message is the revelation of the path to glory i was challenged and challenged by that and a and a minister has wanted a pastor to challenge me upon the things of the message and i just just waited and i said brother i said let me just say this to you this is where i stand this message is the pathway to sonship you forsake it you forsake sonship [Applause] hallelujah it's a pathway home this is the promise of the word it's scripture speaks in isaiah chapter 12 in in that particular chapter here a verse of scripture that we it's very dear to our hearts it lays right in the middle of judgment and that scripture said it shall be a day that is not known whether the light nor dark and it won't be clear at all a day where there's no clarity but it said in the evening time there shall be light and the inspiration would strike the black brother who wrote the song the pathway to glory you shall surely find this is the evening time [Music] this is god keeping his promise there is clarity needed we're not leaving out of here fuzzy and and wondering it's a time of clarity it's a time where god in fulfillment of his word is to remove all ignorance or blur all obscurity to remove the grayness and the grizzledness of the hour and to bring such clarity to sons and daughters of god we're living in the time where sons and daughters of god are to be made manifest this is the hour of our jubilee you want to know why these earthquakes and things are going just as they had them in oklahoma here the other day it's the earth crying out bring forth sons and daughters of god it's crying out hallelujah we see the debauchery and everything of man when man forsakes the word of god and they turn to their own reasonings and to their own intellects god is coming to bring a change upon this earth there'll be a change of administration [Music] hallelujah there's coming a millennium where there will be a peace for a thousand years and it'll lead us then into that future home [Applause] we are delegates of that reality right now we were once living in the turmoil and the wages of sin we were once bound up we were once under a different administration walking according to the prince of power of the air but then he came what brought the change in your life a change of administration hallelujah a change of one in your life you surrendered to him it's a spirit of truth that reveals the path to glory hallelujah the spirit it seeks our hearts out in perfect obedient obedience to the word it's god dealing you see when god's dealing with the heart as god speaks to your heart he's dealing with your heart he's that is the spirit of god drawing us into obedience oh my that's the grace of god as he deals with our heart and he comes and he speaks to our life oh sure there's things that could sting but the grace of god is there to draw us into obedience and in obedience to the voice of god there is victory paul said but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth notice through you have to come through the divine approach whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ now you know brother brown will pick this up when he's preaching in the adoption series and there's a few other messages where brother brown deals with the believer's position in christ and though and and as it keeps working as we read here in ephesians 1 paul is making known to the ephesian church this is what your calling and what god's purpose is for you to be see somebody's got to come and let you know who you are that's that right there starts breaking seals right there when somebody starts letting you know who you really are see you can even be down in a low time but when he comes the enemy the enemy if you let him he'll take the word and run you down but you let the holy spirit get a hold of that word through a gift of god it will take the same word it don't run you down it lifts you up and it exposes the enemy it matters who handles the word one can handle it and it brings bondage but another can handle it and it brings liberty [Music] hallelujah it's not an imagination it's a reality [Applause] this is why brother and when he would take this and the laboring within this hour is for the for the people of god that we would be brought into position as sons and daughters of god it's to know brother brown would say it like this what they are how to enter and what to do after they enter you see in joshua let's look at this approach here this morning in the book of joshua and i can't read all these places but i'm just going to refer to some in joshua chapter 1 and verse 6 now remember here the ministry of moses and joshua it's typed right there in that of the lord jesus it's typed also in the time that we are living in wherein the church ages themselves would speak of a time of moses but then we find joshua who's been present all along that joshua would come in this in the fullness to be able to divide to the children of god their inheritance this is where we are living in this hour where where the same grain that went in the ground god's not coming after a church that somewhat looks like him a little bit no no he's coming back for a bride that would be in his image in his likeness to where the word identifies the working she's born on my bone flesh in my flesh she's me and here joshua the spirit of god speaks here and says be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them so this inheritance joshua is going to divide that only be thou strong and very courageous god speaks these words three different times it speaks of the opposition that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest in other words if i can bring it down is keep your focus on him who has called you don't start looking to the left or to the right and let me just say you can come right here to church and you're still not focused if you walk out those doors and you don't continue on in this word and continue to pray and seek after god of the things that he's done in your life you're not doing what the word said do you can't expect results this is where the word comes to direct you and i be strong and very courageous where you stand in the promises that god is making known to you and there's no excuse well i don't know if this or i don't know that we're without excuse the word has come to speak to our hearts what should i do go forward in the word hallelujah let your life be wrapped in that word let it become part of your prayer part of your confession and everything let it be they come to this moment this is what the whole whole purpose of coming out of egypt was all about was not to come out in the wilderness it was not just to pass through the red sea those were only symbols pointing to a reality hallelujah it was god calling them into a place of their inheritance where what was inside of them who they were to be could really come out in expression hallelujah this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prospers and then thou shalt have good success so the word as the word itself and this it pertains to all of us here and as we look at this this word is to be what we are are given to there's a lot of things brothers and sisters a lot of a lot of things and traps of the enemy that would like to your meditation just the cares of life alone if you don't manage the cares of life uh correctly it'll manage you i told sons we were talking with them just having some certain lessons or whatever and as things come about i said always remember don't let money manage you you manage it and they said you won't even have to dwell on it you may not have the things that there might be things that you want that's fine you you put that up you save for it and if you can have it you have it i said but don't ever let money manage you we have to have it to live but it don't let it manage you because when you let it manage you it takes you it starts to drive you it starts to motivate you that's why the bible says the the money is the root of all evil god keep that covetous spirit away this is what we're to be occupied with is that our our hearts is to be occupied with that word you see this is where that meditation you as soon as you come out of church then the enemy wants to start or on the job something comes out listen we're not ignorant of satan's devices brother brown stands and tells us in christ the mystery he says it's god that's desiring to get this revelation to your heart but you let your husband take it out of you you let he said your job taken out of you you let others let me just tell you when it speaks in that manner it lets you and i know you don't have to let it happen you've got an authority when that word comes joshua he moves forward here with the with the people and he and it's a ministry of preparation god has let him know that this is this land is to be divided now it's a time of preparation he has the people further on down in the scripture to prepare because in three days we're going to cross this jordan and brother brown would make this statement and i i'm just going to read it he says it's a process of getting ready to inherit the promise it's a very key statement it's it's a process of getting ready to inherit the promise remember as i've said here over and over is that you can't put timelines or time frames upon god there's things that even as we would speak about and have been speaking about it can happen in a moment i'm talking about everything brother bram says right there setting at your seat now he's not saying that's where you have to receive it he's always admonishing us you be obedient to the lord but he's letting us know the simplicity of god he said it can come right there and burn everything up and god bring the change that you need he's letting us know this is god's desire it's you and me it's not getting god in condition it's you and me coming into condition i mean we can come into this service and be all out of sorts and god wants to work to get us in condition to speak to us you see the scripture paul would write about how that even when a man is striving for masteries that of a race he's got to run it according to the rules that govern it the scripture said except he strive lawfully he's disqualified so there's an approach that i want to race you you can't when you're running a race and you know as kids and things like that sometimes we always look for certain things i'm going to do and i'll be the one to say go or i'm going to cut here or cut there cut through this to win but winning doesn't come by shortcuts the path to glory can't be altered amen so you see there's always been a path a path an approach to god and brother brown would say like this a very taking a very a very uh simple example he says in the message approach to god if i started to go home this afternoon and cut across the fields i'd find myself sunk down in a mud puddle somewhere the highway has an approach to jeffersonville and i must go the way of the highway it's easy running if you'll just get in the road there's no you can't cut across fields you have to come according to the approach into the city or in to the economy of god into the inheritance that god has for you notice what he says die out to self come through the blood of christ then you can approach the father and he will give you the holy spirit that'll make you a believer because it's not you that's believing anymore it's the holy spirit in you your nature's been changed when joshua this when joshua stands there and here are the people in that moment when he lets them know this is where we're standing we're standing right here before the jordan and preparing to come into our inheritance this is what the call has been about within within the word the message that was sent when god sent moses down to egypt remember i've come to bring you out and into a good land because redemption it has two parts to it it's not just to come out is to go in this is what we've been dealing with you must it must be an entering in into the promises of god that is the same way when the lord jesus himself noticed as he went away he sent back the holy ghost and noticed the whole the whole church of the living god has looked to the second coming of the lord it's been looking for this moment for this season that you and i are living in let me just tell you the rapture itself it has rested as a promise to the believer and it's in this generation that god said this generation shall not pass it's the unfolding of that promise in this hour it hadn't really rested as a promise but then god in fulfillment of his word he took that word of a promise and he unfolded that path to bring you and i into that place of rapturing faith into a rapturing condition into a place where the devil has no claim on the church of the living god where you can say there's nothing that'll stop this bride from going in a rapture that's the certainty of the word that god has delivered to you and i in this hour and their response to joshua is very very important they speak to joshua and he says in joshua 1 16 all that thou commandest us we will do this is an approach you see the word the word delivered by the spirit of truth going forth this is their this is their response all that you've commanded us to do we will do whether so ever thou send us us we will go according as we hearkened unto moses and all things so will we hearken unto thee only only the lord that god be with thee as he was with moses so who would they be hearkening to the same one who sent moses spoke through moses was the same one who would speak through joshua and they are saying we are here to recognize that he's still the same god he might have taken moses off the scene but joshua's still on the scene joshua's been here all along it's the same god among us and here this is a key point all that thou commandeth us to do we will do this deals with a submissive heart this is a working of the holy spirit to bring a heart into submission to bring it into obedience you can't bypass this it's going to be the same that's the work that's what the holy ghost does comes here it's what he does after he comes in no this is done before this makes ready for him to come because if he comes in ahead of time he's stepping in and he marries one that's disagreeable with him and he's an adulterer because you still got a living husband are you going to preach with me now this is why in romans 7 paul said that we were married to the law that old man but now through the body of jesus christ we have become dead to the law that we might be married to jesus christ see the marriage of the new man raising up that seed he can't do it if the old man's still alive he can't do it but the old man's got to be dead buried then he comes and raises up that new man but even in the death of the old man it's his work it's his work i don't know about you but that's a paradox to get the old man to to to agree with the word yes ram said he must do that and then he kills it it comes to a place of sacrifice isn't that wonderful you know that's just wonderful how god just brings that it's all his work it's not we're we're not here under a fear we're not here under a threat this is love divine the scriptures declare in the song of solomon he he hath brought me to his banqueting table and his banner over me is love now joshua he goes on and he speaks to the people as they come to a place there uh and him very close right next to the jordan and he puts this declaration so here the people have said all that you say we will do and now he lets it be known in this time of preparation and he speaks to them sanctify yourselves in verse 5 of joshua 3 sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you and so joshua's let him know let the word itself the priest are going to take the ark of the covenant which is the word of god and they're going to come to the jordan and when they their feet touch stand right there at the brim the way is going to be opened up and they will go and stand in the midst of the jordan you see the priest did not walk through it and then come out on the other side but the priests were standing right in the provided way they weren't in the way of the people but they were in god's provided way proclaiming that this is the provided way they were carrying the ark where it was meant to be carried above the heart not your heart above the word but the word above your heart and they were standing in that way and the jordan opened and it parted now was the time that they were to come into their inheritance and notice the request sanctify yourselves for what god is going to do tomorrow now it shows if god would speak to joshua in that way even into that place the people are aware of what this means to sanctify themselves they knew what that meant that meant to to separate from any uncleanliness to to really consecrate yourself to the work of god that's at hand this is where god calls this is why when the holy spirit's dealing with the life god's calling us into consecration this is when the holy spirit he's dealing with the soul he's calling that soul into a real consecration to where that's the focus that's this is what they're locked in on this is this is my promise and it's all a work of god as he's moving and bringing that all about within that heart this is why when brother branham would say it like this and i'm i'm reading these very intentional he says notice what did joshua do he put the word he what did he put first the clergy no sir he put the word first see he didn't put well what does my what does my church say or what does my denomination say that won't open it up you've got to put the word first this is what god come to do you see church has been exalted man's teachings has had preeminence all those things have had preeminence here but god in this hour has come to declare that he is the one alone to have preeminence he's the one to have preeminence in our thoughts in our lives the word himself is the oneness to have preeminence oh what a great precious reality for the word to have the preeminence in our lives notice he said put the word first take that ark and all you preach stay away from it get behind it don't try to lead it let it lead you he said that's the trouble today we try to get ahead of the word now watch how he says this and bypass and make the word fit this and the word fit back but what we need today is follow the word and my sheep they know my voice and a stranger they will not follow what's he calling lambs he's calling lambs he's calling lambs into a place and moving bringing us into inheritance oh my so bringing us to the jordan and jordan itself it represents as a bible reader you know jordan it represents death death to self this is what jordan it represents death to your own ideas death to the old nature a full dying out to self you see when we look at this brother brown you know you see as he takes this through the message brother sister this is the theme of the word in this hour is that we come back to being sons and daughters of god the mysteries themselves belong to us as the children of god but the word has come to unfold to you and i to bring us into our inheritance to a real consecrated holy ghost-filled life if you have medicine you know how it is they give you medicine you have to take the medicine if you have it and you don't take it then it's your fault right the d you show back up to the doctor well doctor i'm not feeling well i'm not doing this the doctor says well how you've been taking it well yeah doc or you have but you don't tell him the whole story you've been you know one two skip a few 99 100. you're not telling the whole story because in in order for you to say that you've got to be able to say hey i've taken the medicine and it's and it's not working taking the medicine means take it as it has been prescribed so in order to take it when you take that medicine bottle what are you doing that's obedience simple obedience you taking the medicine bottle and the doctors prescribed this to you and oh you take this and it'll get rid of your cough or get rid of this right here you've got to have trust in that you have trust in the doctor once you leave out of his presence now you have medicine that he has prescribed for you and he's not left you to figure it out he wrote on there take it three times a day until finished not until you feel a little better no until it's finished how long do i keep pressing until the work is finished you keep taking the prescribed word listen this is god speaking to our hearts it's god writing and moving in the prescription of the hour what do i do brother samuel i just took two doses this is time for another dose what do i do take another dose what do i do take another dose take the word as is prescribed and when you take it the way it's prescribed then the word will have the effect of the word in your life hallelujah that's that saith the lord it has an effect in your life hallelujah glory be to god there's got to be brother branham lays this out he says it cannot he says that new birth it cannot come until there's a death first this is a simple statement but it's true people don't want to die listen i can't figure out it's very simple you don't want to die but when you get ready to die that's when he'll come they don't want look at this the simple leadings of the holy spirit the simple the simple leadings of the holy spirit they want to take their own thinking of it you can't thank your own thoughts you got to think his thoughts his thoughts are higher than our thoughts is that right his thoughts are his word and that word coming in it calls us to prosper in the thing that he sent it in you can't take the word into your life and not experience change taking place when you take the word in i'm talking about really hearing that word you'll find that the holes and things in your life hit you the things that you struggle with it begins to lose power and authority because this is not the word of a man this is god's word and this word has power and authority in it hallelujah it's the same word where jesus could speak to that cult that was needed in order glory in order to bring him and that he went right in into jerusalem there headed to the crucifixion he said grow and lose that coat that coat was where he saw it in the vision and he told them you go get that coat and loose it they had authority by the word to find where that coat was at and to loose it because it was needed for the master let me just say it i've come with the word this morning god has sent a message god knows just exactly where every life is at and the word comes forth to say loose it the master has need of this hallelujah loose it from doubt loose it from unbelief loose it from oppression loose it from depression loose it from discouragement the master has need of thee you can't think your own thoughts you got to think his thoughts let the mind that was in christ be in you he says he thinks god's thoughts brings god's blessings god's power to you oh as you see he said he'll make a mess out of you as far as the world is concerned but it'll bring new life it'll bring resurrecting life it'll bring new thoughts it'll bring a new person it'll bring a new faith it'll bring you from death unto life what does that the word receiving that word let me say this god comes to bring transformation it doesn't come to leave us in the wilderness he comes his calling is to bring us all the way across jordan see you see this is where the word it enters as brother brown would tell us it enters the mind first that's that that there's a womb in our mind it enters the mind first your mind has to agree with it you've got to bypass your mind like i don't even know what happened no no no in whom you first trusted then it goes to say and believed see you see it enters the mind enters into the womb of the mind then it's believed with the heart then god brings the seal it's all him working to get you and i to stand still oh my just some testimonies i'd love to share here but i need to keep moving with this here first corinthians 6 9 notice how paul is speaking to the corinthian church here he said know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived see here's the spirit of truth it's to break deception because satan realizes this is just what this is exactly what happened where after the outpouring of the holy spirit remember while jesus jesus was here there was judas right after the outpouring of the holy spirit here the antichrist spirit came in among them and satan knows if he can just alter the word in one place one place then he has altered the path to glory and it no longer becomes the path to glory now as a bible reader you realize in the book of proverbs it speaks of a woman who goes out in the street to beguile the simple and it says they that enter into her house they don't come out right her stairs are the way to hell that's a scripture you see she beguiles it's a deception see this is why the gospel itself remember paul warned the people he speaks in corinthians how there were those who were coming among them and paul called him in philippians dogs he called him in corinthians there false workers false apostles they were claiming they were sent they weren't sent by god because when they're sent by god the god that sends you goes in you it's not your message you're now running with the message of a living god and it's god is going to work and puzzling and no there's false workers that's come in why satan's trying to alter it it doesn't matter how religious people can be but if they're altered from that path of glory to where they come back to being a real son and daughter of gift he doesn't care how emotional they get he doesn't care how many gifts that they have come on now first corinthians 13. it doesn't matter how they can speak with tongues of men and angel it doesn't matter they can explain all the mysteries it doesn't matter if they have faith to move mountain if they miss the holy ghost they miss everything let me just tell you something the devil has been at work to try to alter that course but he can't out through the holy ghost hallelujah he might have rode in on a white horse rider he can outdo man's might but he can't out do the holy ghost the holy ghost uncovers his kingdom hallelujah amen notice paul said be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor nor nor adulterers nor effeminate that's that's homosexual nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covenants nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god to inherit means to receive one's portion now let me just say this to you you might have had at your wedding you might have had empty seats your wedding reception you invited certain people they didn't come more food for you to take home let me just tell you something the wedding supper don't got one too many chairs it ain't no such thing that jesus said i didn't know you was going to be an overcomer hey bring another chair we'll squeeze in here somewhere no your place has already been set the place at that table that's what the spirit of god calls upon your life it's him drawing upon your life this is not deception these are the true sayings of god it's truth that calls you to that place of truth there's a place prepared for you it calls you to that place there's not as the scripture would talk about the wedding garment those that wouldn't enter in there's not you know like you go to your acapella choir and you're waiting to try on garments okay you need a bigger one oh you need a smaller one oh we're gonna have to hem yours and all you're gonna oh we got we got five extra god don't have five extra theophanies there's not gonna be five robes where god says man i thought they were gonna make it [Music] hey man he's drawing me there's a place prepared for me hallelujah i've been connected with that garment over there that representation hallelujah it's reflected back down here in my life though we walk in this earth we have an earthly image but there's a reflection of heaven of that place in our lives that declares though my citizenship i might be american or this or that that's here for this body but down here in my soul i've received a real citizenship i was always a son and daughter of god but the citizenship was made by the holy ghost it came and it birthed that reality in my life and that's why you can say i am a pilgrim and a stranger in this world [Applause] you see it calls us into that place this is why when paul is dealing with this here in the scripture he's letting it be known here among the corinthian church they've seen the supernatural remember paul ties them back in first corinthians 10 and he takes them of the journey that israel was on they all ate they ate the meat all late to manna all drank from the spiritual rock all did this all these things but then paul says they were overthrown in the wilderness see what paul's dealing with is is that there could be in these lives and they experience gifts in their life they experience the anointing of the holy spirit but this is still what is in their life you understand there's there's a difference between mistakes and habits are you hearing me now you can't call something where you're still in bondage and say that's a mistake you're in bondage and you need deliverance i know that might be straight but if you take it it'll do you a whole lot of good this is why paul says be not deceived they can set and enjoy the work brother brand brings in the corinthians book of corrections he said you can enjoy the word but you see it's not enough just to enjoy it it's to be one with it see this is why there's there must be with justification a person can they receive a call from god god deals with their life and they repent and they give their life to the lord but yet they still have filthy habits in their life they can still have smoking and drinking and everything else in their life and yet they've given their life to the lord that's god picking up the glass but then there must come a sanctification you can't bypass from justification into the baptism of the holy ghost even in the redemption of of this earth it went from noah then the blood at calvary then it comes back in the fire cleansing there in the millennium and then here comes the future home you can't bypass stages and as i've said i just i'm going to reiterate this it does not mean that you have to labor in a certain stage god can do this work at one moment you don't have to labor within it but but the reason that the holy spirit would bring this out and this is laid there on my heart is because we are at the crossing we are getting ready to move across that continental divide into that other land the rapture is upon us [Applause] it's a time not to be playing around anymore not that playing around was ever acceptable brother samuel what if i get real consecrated and there's another 50 years glory to god you'll have joy for 50 years you'll torment hell for 50 years you'll be satan's nightmare for 50 years he's your life it becomes the joy and the pleasure of your life and you become a witness of the liberty that's in christ jesus because to sanctify a very a simple part it separates from profane things yes and it is a dedication to god notice separate from and it's dedicating to god it's it's all that brother brown would say like this he says after the person i'm just referring to this has been sanctified the unclean habits has gone from the person he is a believer on the lord jesus christ and his habits are gone we believe he's a candidate for the baptism of the holy ghost which is the filling of the spirit of god you see it's cleaned and set aside for service i don't have time to labor on this but god had the altar in the old testament in the tabernacle the altar itself once a year and even in the beginning when they would consecrate the tabernacle that altar had to be sanctified dedicated with blood then then came the fulfillment of that whatever touched the altar was sanctified this that's the scripture in exodus 29 37 whatever touches the altar is then sanctified what is the altar it's a place of death amen it's a place of dying out it's a place of sacrifice sacrifices are brought in they're still they're still alive now comes to the place where the sacrifice is to be offered up right it's a die it's dying out to sell that's what the holy spirit that's what he deals with in a life you see some some could hear and say that's a little bit too i don't think you got to go all that way i mean after all god looks on the heart but whatever's in the heart is gonna come out but you take a heart and there's things that they can know and say you know what there's things right now that's in my life but the difference is they're not content with it they look at it and say lord i'm believing you for a full sanctification and for the holy ghost they're focused a lot of things can come and try to distract them but they got one focus they're focused on the one who dealt with their life they're focused on the god who called them in the beginning they're focused on the one that then they begin to look at things in the message and the reading and the scriptures and all of a sudden what was there all along and what they thought they realized lord it's really that simple what i'm dealing with it's unbelief but they hear what's happening their faith is being energized in the one who's dealing with them who is that that's joshua it's joshua that's letting you know get yourself prepared get yourself ready how do i get myself prepared i've sent a word that you can prepare yourself yield to that word and that word continues to wash you that word continues to prepare you and that same word will please you see this is why let me just have just a few more moments see brother brahma he would take us within this i know it's very simple but this is it's a theme all the way through this is a scripture before there can be a resurrection there's got to be a death before a man can be raised up in the resurrection with christ he has to die out to himself die out to all his worldly associates die out to all of his worldly habits die out to everything that's ungodly and be resurrected anew yeah this is why there's just there's just no there's no shortcuts at all it's walking on with god right my i just let me just let me just have can i have just a few more moments in the message a prisoner we could go on in different places in the scripture and see this it was rebecca it was with esther they had to yield they surrendered to the call and then what the word said do they had a willingness in their heart to do what the word said do it was god calling brother brown makes this simple in in the message a prisoner he speaks of how and he takes us in how the priests were dressed and how that others in order for them to be dressed aaron and his sons they had to come before the door and appear before moses moses being that representative of the word that god had given god had given the vision what they were about ready to walk into was from was from the mind of god from that of heaven now reflected down into earth in a type and hear the word here they were to come before that word and remember they had to be dressed but before they could ever be dressed they had to be washed and moses had to wash them what what do we do when we take a bath we'll get cleaned up we smell better no what's happening is i mean you could put cologne and perfume on and if you've got stench on you smell like a clean dirty person i'm not saying it to be funny but i'm saying you understand what does water do what is so supposed to do what does that come to do i know it's a very simple lesson right here maybe the cdc would like to give me a little bit of kickback on this very very simple it is there to loosen the grime and the water is there to wash away the dirt this is why the spirit of god comes into the word he's there to loosen the hold of dirt and of the grime of the world and to wash it away what's he doing he's uncovering sons and daughters of god we are uncovered by the washing of water by the word it's washing away the filth of the world i don't know that's what he's doing this is why jesus said sanctify them through thy truth by thy word that word is true amen hallelujah he made a way through his altar his altar his altar was not just there at calvary where did that altar begin where was that altar right here where he surrendered his will to the will of the father it's very very simple it's dying out to sell it's surrendering you surrender and then god takes you to the baptism of the holy ghost god takes you into that place god takes you you have need of healing god takes you into your hearing god takes you into what you have needed because it's a promise of god and when we come according to the word of god then the laws of god operate according to that word brother graham talks about this loosening and he says he says i'm trying to get you to cut loose to have a starting place and he talks about even he says how the women are dressing see sometimes these things to the world that just like well you know that paul was a old woman hater paul wasn't a woman hater paul could say let him that's spiritual acknowledge that the things that i have wrote to you are the commandments of the lord paul wrote the hair shouldn't be cut paul wrote to wear modest clothing that whole word modest means free-flowing see it's an evil spirit that anoints women to want to display themselves they were meant to be displayed like that let me tell you if you display yourself like that you'll also get the results where you have others that are filled with them kinds of desires but it's holiness unto god his word brings about holiness in our lives it's obedience to his word there's no other way around it let me just let me just deal with this here he says now sometimes he said people he said when i make that statement about clothing and what you wear is that sometimes they say oh that's just a little thing who's who who's saying it's a little thing amen and furthermore who gave you the right to say it's a little thing you're exhausting yourself above the word when you call things well that's just a little thing yeah that's just a little weakness you're exalting that above god's word we have to exalt the word remember the word is to be carried above the heart we see a system right now the mother of harlots and her daughters those denominations they've exalted man's teaching above god and they call it god but it don't produce god in the people it produces emotion and it produces everything else it produces intellectualism but it doesn't bring god down in their lives [Applause] but god he steps in his word to come down into our lives that we would be reflections of him you don't want to be known by church name you want to be known by the name of jesus christ that when the word speaks to you you say yes papa yes papa hallelujah it's a little thing brother brown said you've got to start somewhere amen why not begin with your abcs cut loose of the worldly looks let the hair grow get the earrings out get the pants throw them away oh brother samuel you know you can't do that it's got to be god i that spirit is not welcome here that passive spirit of well it's got to be god do it brother samuel i agree but it takes the spirit of god he's calling it out and letting you know you can't inherit the kingdom of god if you keep walking that way you've got to separate from that [Music] what do i do be like david i hate god what you hate hallelujah i stand for righteousness hallelujah hallelujah and cut loose of the worldly looks and become a prisoner to christ just keep on cut loose of everything till finally the last line is cut loose there might be one line cut you might say brother samuel i have i got like 10 lines keep cutting here you come back to me maybe by midweek oh two lines were cut away then here you come back my five lines went away you know what's happening you're getting stronger you're building up let me just tell you it doesn't happen if you just leave out of here and you just go on back about your normal everyday life you just take it out of here and say well boy i'm not a good service today my that was real good but it's time to apply that word it's time to get down to business and say god this is what i need in my life [Applause] oh god i wish i had the strength to preach it the way i feel it keep on cutting to you everything is loose then you're a prisoner then you're in his grip the scripture said follow follow peace with all men hebrews 12 14 and holiness without which no man can see the lord brother says if you don't become like god you won't see him amen you got to become like him then then you'll see him this is why as he writes that we have an altar in hebrews 13 that they which serve that in the tabernacle have no right to eat in this altar see that they were granted rights to eat there by the genealogy and birth that they were levites but paul is letting them know this altar belonged to them who are born of the spirit of god this altar belongs to sons and daughters of god what is an altar it's a place of sacrifice and in order for jesus that he might sanctify us with his own blood he suffered without the gate that's why the word calls us beyond our own camp it calls us beyond our own sound barrier it calls us beyond ourselves says it just just in this manner he goes and talking continue about the the dressing and the wearing of things and cutting a hair and going back into this he says now don't try to be like the first lady of the land be like god empty yourself up so that christ can pour himself into you and you can be really filled with the holy spirit let me close in this galatians 5 19. now look how the spirit of god brings this paul brings us down to the galatian church because here he says now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanliness lassiviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variants emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which i tell you before as i've also told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god key word they that do to do means you are content with it right paul is dealing with you cannot live see see it comes into these places here where it's things that people are continuous envies bless god if they tread on me i'll give them a piece of my mind nobody treads on me nobody says anything against me they'll that don't sound like a lamb he can't come to that because it ain't a lamb nobody's going to push me around or this still being there that if things ain't going your way oh my everybody's going to know about it you give everybody the silent treatment i'm going to make them pay that ain't the spirit of god now let me just tell you this there's a part of what we've been dealing with on thursday where your flesh are my flesh and my spirit even after being sealed with the spirit of god i have to bring it in subjection but i no longer live at this address this is not who i'm known to be come on now i'm not who i'm known to be i'm not that same person i have to bring my flesh and subjection what paul is saying is is that if you're still content with these things saying that's just a small thing this is just a little thing oh you don't know my past you don't know my upbringing you don't know there's no excuses there's no excuses there's liberty to set you free there's liberty in jesus christ to set you free to sanctify you to cleanse you remember the sanctifying i'm closing is to make you ready to be filled with the spirit of god you see every one of us can you remember when god dealt with our life and you repented you just felt like my goodness it just felt like the lord of the world it still no doubt had you know all sorts of the love of the world was still within your life and maybe habits and things like but you just felt like whew man the lord's been lifted and it's a good feeling it's a work of the holy spirit that has dealt with your heart to bring you to that place to make peace with god but it's with the purpose that he might not just sanctify because sanctification is compound cleaned and set aside for certain god is drawing him that he himself can come and live inside amen i will be their god i will walk and talk in them they shall be my sons and daughters i will be their father this is god's promise i see to many people can hear this and what a blessed people you are i'll say that we are that when the word could deal with our hearts it's not something where we come to a place of just we were looking for a stopping place like elisha when that mantle struck our life i want a double portion i want that life i want him you've not been drawn to a church it's him that's why i'm just walking in the water baptism that ain't enough it's a step but the objective why were you baptized in the name of jesus christ and repented why is it that you cry you cry to god and say god sanctify my life from the things of the world that you might be filled with the holy ghost that you might receive that earnest of your inheritance and be a manifested son and daughter of god well you'll not be perfect in yourself but you'll have the perfection of his life and his nature on the inside of you where now he is alive inside of you there's been a passing there's been a change a passing from death unto life and this is what paul said and i close with this scripture what we read here in first corinthians 6 all those things that paul read and said be not deceived and went through all of them and said shall not inherit the kingdom of god here's what he said in verse 11 and such were some of you the scripture even in hebrews 11 would say rehab the harlot that's left there in hebrews 11 that you and i can identify who that is but it's also to let you and i know this is who she was but the transforming power of god came upon rahab's life that's what she used to be that's what you used to be known as [Music] and such were some of you but you are washed you are sanctified you are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god love of the world is gone he's the love of your life he's your life he's my all in all even when things would come about your life and if there's something that that that you've said even a thought that's been wrong the spirit of god the dove on the inside he who is the sanctifier it moves up in your life he said lord forgive me because your desire is what he longed for and what jesus prayed for that they might be where i am he prayed for our fellowship amen was fellowship an expression of a son and daughter of god oh my when my wife and i we we got married oh i i wanted children and you know we wait until you know god's time and so forth but i i can remember as it got close and god began to deal with her heart in dealing with my heart this might sound funny to you but i can remember sometimes waking up on saturday mornings and here but thought my what will it be like to hear you know the movement of that diaper running through the room and you know you just you have to imagine they're calling out daddy and yet she wasn't even expecting at the time but i never forget when i came home that one night real late from from a coaching event and i came home and three o'clock in the morning i got in from traveling back from from a scouting thing and come back and there was a a card that was a happy birthday card and he said happy birthday daddy [Applause] let me tell you something it was hard to sleep that night i got in at three from scouting the game way down in i think it was dayton that night i just got in three maybe four in the morning i waited there i couldn't hardly sleep i waited on the edge that bed i waited for her because she had to get up at five in the morning to go in as a nurse aide and work i waited there and i waited at that time when she got up the only thing i got to do is hug her i said oh yeah that's wonderful i tell you what i waited you know at that point in time sound funny it sounds silly you say brother samuel you're a you're you're a god i know it and i went around at toys r us and looked at baby stuff hallelujah and you and i god has been waiting he's been longing for fellowship to where that life could be expressed brother and sister when his presence is moving on my life he never forgot about where you are he knows just right where you were he knows where you are this morning he's not come to isolate you he's come to let you know i want to have fellowship with you i love to have fellowship with you i went to calvary with you in mind i paid the price for you that you could come and be laid on the altar and die to yourself i made a way for you that then you could receive the life you were intended to have before the fall i made a way for you [Music] hallelujah we couldn't get out of this mess but our captain from glory came hallelujah our captain came down and he spoke to you and i said come with me let's go over this jordan this is our promises i say this morning this is your promise those of us that's in the land no matter where we're what's going on in your life right now it might be sickness it might be trouble in your mind remember take the word yes for by the word thou shalt make thy way prosperous and have a good success take the way of the word don't take your way of leading say god you lead me here brother samuel i don't know what to do don't get anxious just be still stand still and see the salvation of the lord let god open up the way well you might say well brother simon i've been here for years i've been around the message for years just throw that spirit of pride away so you're not keeping me back this is my promise you're not holding me back i've got a call there's a call across jordan this inheritance belongs to me and the simplicity is is just simply surrendering and dying out and say lord take me across lord god i don't want nothing to do with this world there's nothing that means anything more to me i want to be united with you lord hallelujah if i can say it like this and it don't sound carnal jesus christ we're bust robust [Applause] i want jesus [Applause] that's what this message proclaims that's what this gospel proclaims not come to a church but come into jesus christ [Applause] if there's things in your life that's holding you back a sanctifier is here this morning and not only will he sanctify you if you'll ask him and say lord sanctify my life he'll come and he'll fill your life this is his word you're not following the word of a man we're following the word of god this is thus says the lord this is the way that has been opened to us this is the open door this is the entrance that's ministered unto you and i mean let's pray heavenly father lord jesus you're merciful lord you're so mindful and no matter lord of what the enemy lord would try to do and even lord in any of his deceptive or or conniving ways lord you make yourself known that you are the mighty conqueror you reveal lord god his deception you reveal his workings and you make known your own working lord oh father i pray this morning oh god for hearts that have sat here lord they've sat here lord for these this time lord they've even god even would give lord a few more moments lord or i've had to just lord just just come to a place and and just stepping aside lord i'm just asking lord that as you've come to speak to our hearts lord may you just now lord i pray just continue to move upon every life and every need that's here lord if there's one that doesn't know you and they haven't surrendered it there's things lord that maybe it isn't lord things of habits outwardly lord of smoking or this or that are they but maybe lord it's just things to steal that of the world to where it's within lord it's just filled with malice and bitterness and all sorts of things lord to where there's things that lord that they realize and say lord that's not that's not who i want to be it's not who i want to be i want to be what you want me to be i lord i want to be a real son and daughter of god or maybe they've been walking along the way but they got off of the way and they started out lord and uh started getting off the way in instead of becoming more and more and letting as a lamb or they let things come around in their life maybe it's disappointments maybe it's things that lord that maybe they had a right to this or to that but right now lord is in their heart that they would as a lamb they're willing to forsake their rights they're willing to let the word come [Music] and shave them down lord the scripture said in isaiah 53 our part is hidden right there he was led as a lamb is dumb before her shearers lord through your sacrifice through your yielding you made a way that we can die to ourselves lord we've not come to an altar of man we've not come lord god to an altar of a church but we've come to that altar for god complete sacrifice dying to self and lord the real truth and real reality is [Music] even after the holy ghost has come we find ourselves like paul i die daily dying to our own will dying to our own thoughts lord god to aware that the spirit of god on the inside is molding our character shaping us lord through tests through trials through situations the lord that the character within our life that of a son and daughter of god is prepared and ready to go into that mold of that theophany body lord help us lord i pray just as lord death in this body from the spirit lord when he would go out but i've been right there where many of the brothers and sisters been right there or god when they've taken their last breath and lord jesus right from this that body that they lived in that house the real son or daughter of god that occupied that house that body it went into that body that is prepared and reserved in the heavens there lord standing in the splendor of youth [Music] lord god when they will come back lord jesus on that rapture mourning lord they will be given a glorified body a human body that will not be that which has come forth [Music] my father and mother but lord it will be that that
