[26:41] i'd like to read from genesis chapter 12
[26:44] verses 1 through 3 and i have a couple
[26:47] other scriptures as well
[26:54] what i want to speak on tonight is i
[26:56] just want to be a blessing
[27:04] now the lord said to abram get thee out
[27:06] of thy country and from thy kindred and
[27:08] from thy father's house
[27:10] unto a land that i will shoot thee
[27:12] i will make thee a great nation and i
[27:14] will bless thee
[27:16] and make thy name great and thou shalt
[27:18] be a blessing
[27:20] and i will bless them that bless thee
[27:22] and curse him that curseth thee
[27:25] and in thee shall all the families of
[27:27] the earth be blessed
[27:30] if you turn me to ecclesiastics

[27:47] also luke chapter 6 verse 38
[27:57] give and it shall be given unto you good
[28:00] measure pressed down shaken together and

[28:36] lost a heartbeat we only got so many
[28:38] more left
[28:42] and because your heart's only going to
[28:45] beat so many times then it's going to

[29:26] going along a different path
[29:30] and you may think well i wish i would
[29:32] have maybe turned earlier
[29:36] but you can't you can't go back and undo
[29:38] the past all you can do with is what
[29:40] you've got that lays ahead of you
[29:43] what you're doing right now
[29:46] you can
[29:48] you can only serve god as you serve one
[29:51] another
[29:52] as you serve as people
[29:54] you only love god as you love one
[29:57] another
[29:59] you show kindness to god by showing
[30:02] kindness to one another
[30:07] i serve you you serve me we serve god
[30:10] together
[30:14] the bible says in so much you've done it
[30:16] unto the least these my little ones
[30:17] you've done it unto me
[30:21] brother adam said if you want to be a
[30:23] blessing
[30:26] so if you want to get a blessing
[30:29] let's be a blessing
[30:32] be a blessing to someone else and
[30:34] blessing will return to you
[30:36] like casting your bread upon the water
[30:38] it'll return
[30:41] you usually reap just as you sow
[30:44] so let's do good talk good be kind
[30:48] and if people talk about us
[30:50] say good things and kind things about
[30:52] them
[30:54] and good things will come our way if
[30:56] we'll give them out
[30:59] i was reading where you know brother
[31:02] venom talked about what had happened
[31:03] down in houston when mr best
[31:06] uh came and made that challenge
[31:09] and you remember brother branham
[31:11] wouldn't go down he wasn't going to
[31:13] argue with him
[31:14] and brother bosworth said i'll take the
[31:16] challenge
[31:18] he was and brother bosworth was an older
[31:20] man
[31:21] and by brother bosworth went down there
[31:23] and took the man's challenge and it was
[31:25] a challenge on divine healing and so
[31:27] forth and
[31:30] then mr best had a photographer with him
[31:35] to snap and take pictures
[31:37] and he stuck his finger in
[31:39] brother bosworth's face and said take a
[31:41] picture
[31:43] and
[31:44] he was making all these gestures and
[31:46] saying take a picture and everything you
[31:48] know when you read about it it was just
[31:50] horrible how this man acted
[31:54] he he didn't act with the character of
[31:57] christ at all
[31:59] and the way he was treating that that
[32:01] elder in the lord
[32:03] was just horrible
[32:05] what brother branham said about it was
[32:08] he has a right to his beliefs that's
[32:10] what the boys in korea are fighting for
[32:16] so the prophet of god could look through
[32:18] and pass all that
[32:20] and make a statement like that
[32:23] so when someone talks bad about you just
[32:26] return kindness and
[32:29] good
[32:31] i know it's against this flesh
[32:35] but that's good for you because we know
[32:36] we're supposed to die to this flesh
[32:39] daily anyway
[32:41] so anytime somebody talks bad about you
[32:43] you just got an opportunity to die to
[32:45] your flesh
[32:53] brother branham went to
[32:54] speak in indianapolis
[32:56] indiana and uh when he got there they
[32:59] took up an offering for him
[33:02] and uh someone told him when he was on
[33:04] his way
[33:05] to the pulpit that they had taken up a
[33:08] love offering for him brother branham
[33:10] said you didn't have to do that
[33:13] i didn't come here for an offering
[33:15] i just come to be a blessing
[33:18] but i've got four children and a wife at
[33:20] home and i've got expenses
[33:23] and so i thank you for the offering and
[33:26] i pray that god will return it to you a
[33:29] hundred fold over
[33:36] he said in the great commission he said
[33:38] we never come for money
[33:41] we come to help you and to have
[33:42] fellowship
[33:44] we want to be a blessing to you
[33:46] and we know that you'll be a blessing to
[33:48] us
[33:49] you might not realize it friends but
[33:51] when when ministers come here and preach
[33:54] you're a blessing to them
[33:57] it's a blessing to get to preach here
[33:59] you're wonderful people to preach to
[34:02] you pull on the spirit of god you pull
[34:05] on the gift of god
[34:07] you make it easy to preach you make
[34:08] preaching enjoyable
[34:13] i never dread preaching here
[34:17] you might laugh at that but
[34:19] i
[34:20] i went to minister i was out on the road
[34:23] here
[34:25] oh 25 some years ago
[34:28] and uh i went to preach at a church
[34:31] and uh i went in there and you know a
[34:33] lot of times if you're out traveling and
[34:35] that you'll have like a
[34:37] uh a bag of messages
[34:40] sermons that you're gonna preach and you
[34:42] just
[34:42] let the lord select out of that bag you
[34:45] know and
[34:46] and unless he's going to give you
[34:47] something new off the cuff
[34:50] and uh so i came out and i thought i was
[34:52] going to preach one of the one of the
[34:54] good ones you know
[34:56] and boy i'll tell you what it was dead
[34:58] as could be
[35:00] and i felt like i was plowing
[35:04] not behind the plow
[35:06] but in front of it
[35:09] and and that whole service is that way
[35:13] and when it when it was i couldn't wait
[35:15] for it to be over
[35:18] i started praying while i was preaching
[35:19] lord please help me to get through this
[35:22] i'm not i'm not joking this was this is
[35:24] the truth
[35:26] and
[35:27] so when the service is over then i
[35:29] realized i had to preach that night too
[35:33] and i thought lord
[35:34] what am i going to do
[35:36] that about killed me this morning
[35:39] and you know
[35:41] if the people just clam up on you just
[35:43] sit on your net
[35:44] it's hard
[35:46] and you you have to do it all yourself
[35:49] and uh you got to preach amen and pull
[35:52] and everything else and
[35:54] and uh
[35:55] it's hard
[35:57] and and depending on the spirits that
[35:59] are out there why
[36:01] uh you know uh
[36:03] there's a hint there can be a hindrance
[36:06] and it hinders the thoughts from flowing
[36:09] so it's always a privilege when you get
[36:10] to come and preach at a group where the
[36:13] thoughts can just flow and the spirit
[36:15] can just flow and the people are there
[36:17] to receive and they're pulling
[36:19] that's always a privilege
[36:24] you're probably wondering how sunday
[36:26] night went
[36:30] well i came in there sunday night and
[36:31] preached a little evangelistic message
[36:33] full of fire and set the church on fire
[36:39] but that was the cause of the lord i was
[36:40] back there praying lord i had no idea
[36:42] what to speak on
[36:45] and uh the preacher come up to me the
[36:48] pastor after the service sunday night he
[36:50] said i was wondering about you this
[36:51] morning he said but you brought him on
[36:53] the scene tonight
[36:54] [Laughter]
[37:00] hallelujah
[37:02] we don't we go to be a blessing to
[37:04] people you know
[37:05] many of you uh
[37:07] how many remembers brother ben brother
[37:08] jackie ben
[37:10] brother benton would always say when he
[37:12] got up i just want to be a blessing
[37:15] and uh
[37:16] he he said that all the time
[37:19] and brother rowell soriano wrote a song
[37:22] i just want to be a blessing he wrote it
[37:24] for brother ben
[37:27] and
[37:28] his brother benton uh
[37:30] sung that song
[37:32] wherever he went and places he would
[37:35] sing that song that brother broadwell
[37:36] wrote i just wanted to be a blessing and
[37:39] i was thinking about him it's what got
[37:41] me to thinking about this just wanting
[37:43] to be a blessing to others
[37:46] and when you have that right attitude
[37:49] like that why you're not looking to
[37:51] receive a blessing from somebody you're
[37:53] looking at how you can bless them what
[37:55] can you do for them
[38:02] you know we should live every day as if
[38:05] we're living in our last hour
[38:09] if we live our each hour as if it's the
[38:11] last one
[38:13] then we're we're always going to be
[38:14] ready to go
[38:19] and if we're living each hour as if it's
[38:21] the last one then what are we doing
[38:23] during that hour
[38:25] what are we doing for the lord during
[38:26] that hour
[38:30] what are we doing for god's people
[38:36] brother brahm said let's be a blessing
[38:37] to others
[38:39] and try to do all we can for remember
[38:41] this is the only time that we're
[38:45] mortal
[38:48] this is the only time
[38:51] that we're mortal
[38:53] this is a time to win souls to christ
[38:57] this is a time
[38:59] to bring
[39:01] knowledge of the privileges that we have
[39:05] through the vicarious suffering of the
[39:08] lord on calvary
[39:10] healing
[39:17] that the
[39:18] sinners will come to the lord
[39:21] the backslidden would return back again
[39:25] this is a time of mortal
[39:27] this is a time when you can do something
[39:30] for one another
[39:32] i
[39:34] i don't think i'm gonna be too thinking
[39:37] about what can you do for me when i get
[39:39] in to the wedding supper
[39:45] but it's now when you can do something
[39:46] for others
[39:54] brother braham says in service we would
[39:56] see jesus he says
[39:58] we have come to be a blessing to you
[40:00] and we know that you'll be a blessing to
[40:02] us pardon me
[40:06] and through it all we pray that god and
[40:08] our father will be glorified
[40:10] in our meeting
[40:12] for that's the purpose we come for
[40:16] we come so that the lord can be
[40:18] glorified
[40:20] how is the lord glorified
[40:22] from his people through his people
[40:27] as a as a preacher
[40:29] i come to be a help to people
[40:33] not to beat them down or put them down
[40:35] but to help them lift them up
[40:37] encourage them
[40:40] sometimes correct them
[40:43] put their feet back on the right path
[40:47] pardon me
[40:55] brother branham
[40:58] preached the message
[40:59] i'll tell you the title of it in a
[41:00] minute
[41:03] but in that message he talked about if
[41:06] you're a sheep you're willing to be
[41:07] shorn of your rights
[41:10] and it talked about how that women of
[41:12] the age would say it's my privilege to
[41:15] wear what i want to wear
[41:19] because i'm an american and that's my
[41:21] american privilege and what i'm wearing
[41:23] besides they're not going to throw me
[41:25] off the street for it
[41:29] they're not going to throw me off the
[41:30] street for wearing pants
[41:34] brother brahma says yes that is your
[41:36] privilege
[41:38] but if you are a sheep you're willing to
[41:41] be sure
[41:43] of your rights
[41:45] sheep are willing to be shorn of what
[41:47] they came here with
[41:57] and he said
[42:00] i'm here to help you
[42:02] not to hurt you i want to be a blessing
[42:06] and he says all this in the message
[42:08] painted face jezebel
[42:14] and he goes on to say toward the
[42:17] end of that message he said i pray
[42:19] that you'll take this little cut up
[42:21] evangelistic message tonight to your
[42:23] hearts and go home and pray over it
[42:28] and say god be merciful to me
[42:31] and say i accept it as truth
[42:36] so here he preached this
[42:38] hard cutting message of painted face
[42:42] jezebel
[42:45] and then says i don't want to hurt you
[42:48] i just want to be a blessing
[42:51] now how is he being a blessing there
[42:52] might have been people who walked out of
[42:54] that servant and said well i'll tell you
[42:55] one thing he didn't bless me
[43:03] but he was being a blessing by making
[43:05] sure they didn't stray off
[43:08] the narrow way
[43:11] and so
[43:12] so many denominations have done
[43:16] they've they've left the paths of
[43:19] holiness that they once walked
[43:22] and now they've they've talked their way
[43:24] into accepting things of the world as
[43:28] being okay
[43:30] they still profess to holiness they
[43:33] still profess to be godly
[43:36] but when you look at him you can't tell
[43:37] any difference between them in the world
[43:40] i'm not saying that to put them down
[43:44] that's terrible how far they've fallen
[43:52] what about us
[43:56] where are we at
[44:04] brother branham was being a blessing by
[44:06] telling them the truth
[44:10] brother brandon dramatizes about micah
[44:12] you remember the story of micah in the
[44:14] bible
[44:15] brother branham dramatizes that and says
[44:17] when micah was coming
[44:18] the town why they met him
[44:21] and they said well now now listen
[44:24] uh
[44:27] we uh uh
[44:30] we want you to
[44:32] uh
[44:34] just watch how you speak
[44:37] and you know don't say anything about
[44:40] horse racing because the pastor owns a
[44:42] racehorse and he bets on him
[44:46] and uh
[44:48] now don't say anything about brotherhood
[44:50] since those bunco games that they have
[44:52] down in the church basement
[44:54] because you know the ladies they they go
[44:57] down there after prayer meeting
[45:00] it says not and they were giving micah a
[45:02] list of what he couldn't preach on
[45:05] brother madam says micah finally looked
[45:06] at him and said well what can i preach
[45:08] on
[45:10] he said i want to be a blessing they
[45:12] said we want you to be a blessing
[45:15] but said you know usually those
[45:16] evangelists are those fiery fireballs
[45:19] we think better than that of you
[45:23] and he said what can i preach on they
[45:24] said well we only got one jew in the
[45:26] church preach on the jews
[45:34] brother braham said micah wasn't a
[45:36] compromise
[45:39] he was a man of god
[45:42] and he come down there to preach the
[45:43] word of god
[45:48] he said
[45:49] but look at evangelism today in
[45:51] pentecost they're afraid to speak the
[45:53] truth
[45:56] i don't care if it hurts the pastor
[45:59] or who it hurts it's god's eternal word
[46:02] and we're responsible for it and the
[46:04] preaching of it we must tell the truth i
[46:06] don't care how bad it hurts
[46:13] but i just want to be a blessing
[46:20] to be a blessing you must tell the truth
[46:28] you know we love our children
[46:31] those of you that have
[46:32] raised children you know you love them
[46:35] but there's sometimes you gotta bring
[46:37] correction
[46:40] there's sometimes when you got to say
[46:41] okay that's enough
[46:44] you went far enough
[46:49] and you know you know how they are well
[46:51] you don't love me
[46:57] well i'm just going to run away
[47:04] i was talking about children not the
[47:06] people in church
[47:11] but sometimes i feel like that's how
[47:12] some folks are in church
[47:15] you hurt my feelings you don't love me
[47:16] if you love me you wouldn't talk to me
[47:18] that way
[47:19] you wouldn't bring that up
[47:22] sometimes people think a pastor gets up
[47:24] in the pulpit looks over the people
[47:26] decides what to preach
[47:29] and that's not the truth at all
[47:31] you've got on your heart what's going to
[47:33] be preached before you ever know who's
[47:35] there
[47:37] and i'm human
[47:39] i get up here and know what the lord got
[47:41] on my heart to preach and i can i can
[47:43] look out over my congregation and see
[47:45] different things and say
[47:47] lord help me
[47:49] i've got to say this anyhow
[47:54] and you know there's sometimes there's
[47:55] things you've got to preach on that you
[47:57] think as a pastor you shouldn't never
[47:58] have to preach on
[48:02] we shouldn't have to preach on i don't
[48:04] know what you call them leggings stretch
[48:06] pant things or whatever
[48:08] we shouldn't have to preach on belly
[48:09] shirts
[48:14] but sometimes
[48:16] it becomes necessary
[48:24] the greatest blessing
[48:26] is giving out
[48:27] brother ram said
[48:30] it's been
[48:31] 30 years
[48:33] that i've served the lord
[48:36] if there's any regrets
[48:38] it's the years past before i did serve
[48:40] the lord
[48:42] and i'm trusting god to help me as i
[48:44] journey down the lanes of life that god
[48:46] would lead me by his spirit and let me
[48:49] do something
[48:50] to show my appreciations for the cause
[48:53] that i was born on this earth for
[48:57] each and every one of you you were born
[48:59] here for a purpose
[49:02] you might say well i'm fulfilling that
[49:04] purpose but brother branham said we
[49:06] ought to be able to show our
[49:07] appreciation to god
[49:11] for the purpose he sent us here
[49:14] for that god give you the
[49:18] he give you the opportunity to live this
[49:21] life
[49:28] you know
[49:30] i
[49:32] had the opportunity of traveling
[49:34] overseas twice with my dad
[49:38] brother bill been with me many many
[49:40] times
[49:43] and when my dad would go
[49:47] whatever money he left the states with
[49:49] he came back with maybe not even a penny
[49:54] he just
[49:55] he just would give
[49:58] and i'm not making this all about money
[50:00] but i got a point to make
[50:03] and
[50:04] he would always say
[50:06] when you
[50:07] leave this life
[50:09] the only thing you can take with you is
[50:11] what you've done for the lord
[50:14] and you do for the lord as you do for
[50:16] others
[50:18] you can't take your money with you you
[50:20] can't take your houses your cards or any
[50:22] of those things but what you've done for
[50:24] the lord that you can take with you when
[50:27] you go
[50:28] that's the only thing that's going to
[50:30] mean something when you pass from this
[50:33] life
[50:34] is what you've done for the lord
[50:36] and you do for the lord by doing for his
[50:39] people
[50:42] and you know when you do it you don't do
[50:43] it expecting return
[50:48] even though the prophet said if you want
[50:50] a blessing be a blessing
[50:52] but you don't do it with that in mind
[50:54] well i'm going to see what i can get
[50:57] but you do it from the depths of your
[50:59] heart because you want to do it you're
[51:01] not looking for anything in return
[51:09] he said
[51:12] i pray the lord will help me and bless
[51:15] me
[51:16] so that i could be a blessing to you
[51:18] people
[51:19] i found out the greatest blessing in his
[51:21] life is giving something out not in
[51:24] receiving it
[51:25] but giving out
[51:27] what you do for others is what means so
[51:30] much
[51:38] i want to i want to read this to you
[51:42] he said if the devil can keep us
[51:44] separated and he's got a shooting at one
[51:47] another
[51:48] so
[51:50] he's got an open target anywhere he
[51:52] shoots and what's the use of shooting
[51:54] we're shooting one another
[51:56] so he can sit back and relax
[52:00] i have found grace
[52:02] in your sight through god you take my
[52:04] word for this brother
[52:06] if you want to be a blessing and get a
[52:08] blessing
[52:09] when a man has done you wrong
[52:12] and he has absolutely justly i mean he's
[52:16] done you wrong and you know that he's
[52:18] done you wrong
[52:20] he's done you evil
[52:23] don't mention that
[52:26] you take him to prayer before god
[52:30] and don't take it in such a selfish way
[52:33] as i i'm supposed to do this
[52:39] but stand shoulder
[52:41] your shoulder to his shoulder and stand
[52:43] in the presence of god our father
[52:46] a way a prayer should be made in the
[52:48] presence of god father here's my
[52:50] brethren he's justly deserves punishment
[52:53] for what he's done me evil and i don't
[52:55] see why he did it
[52:58] then let god go to talking to you
[53:02] and you'll see maybe what that man's
[53:05] been through
[53:09] maybe he didn't mean
[53:12] it that way
[53:17] i uh
[53:19] i kind of
[53:20] for myself i speak for myself i've kind
[53:23] of learned a lesson on pastoring
[53:27] that if i'm really bad sick
[53:31] i don't i don't mingle with the people i
[53:34] don't mean about covid and all this
[53:36] other stuff i'm talking about if i've
[53:38] got a really bad sinus infection i won't
[53:40] mingle with the people
[53:42] i won't let the people get around me
[53:44] i'll go to church i'll stay in the back
[53:47] because
[53:48] tell you what happened to me one time
[53:51] a
[53:53] a brother come to me and i was i had
[53:55] come to church i had my associate
[53:57] preaching
[53:58] i'd come to church and i had a really
[53:59] bad sinus infection and my head was
[54:02] hurting
[54:03] and uh i just couldn't hardly stand the
[54:06] pressure if you ever had sinus
[54:07] infections you know what i'm talking
[54:09] about that pressure just feels like that
[54:11] pressure's all in your face
[54:14] and uh i get a little short when i get
[54:16] that way
[54:18] and uh
[54:19] so this brother come to me and begin to
[54:23] attack me
[54:24] over
[54:25] what he thought my daughter's the heels
[54:28] he thought they were wearing weren't
[54:30] short enough
[54:33] and so
[54:35] i didn't have a lot of patience
[54:39] because
[54:40] this same brotherhood come to me some
[54:42] years before over heels my wife was
[54:44] wearing
[54:46] and i don't want to get into it but
[54:48] you know there was many things that were
[54:50] said and uh
[54:53] during that first go-round and then here
[54:55] he comes and
[54:57] and so
[54:58] i did that i just was not feeling like
[55:01] talking to anybody
[55:03] and so
[55:05] i was i was rather abrupt with him
[55:09] and it hurt his feelings
[55:12] and uh so
[55:14] he went on and left
[55:16] and i left and i got to thinking about
[55:18] it and i called him up and i said listen
[55:21] i had a sinus infection i was very
[55:23] abrupt with you
[55:25] i said i i raised my voice
[55:28] i said i wasn't feeling well
[55:30] and i apologize for that
[55:32] but what i said was the truth
[55:39] and so
[55:40] i
[55:41] came back in a later message
[55:44] and i spoke about women's hills
[55:47] and i said if you want to see
[55:50] go look at the film 20th century prophet
[55:53] and in the beginning of that film
[55:55] brother branham brings these two
[55:56] brothers in and they come and sit in the
[55:58] living room and sister meaty comes out
[56:00] carrying a tray with some refreshments
[56:02] on it i said she's wearing heels
[56:06] if those heels were all right for her
[56:08] then they're all right for everybody
[56:09] else brother venom never preached you
[56:11] had to wear flats
[56:14] now there are there are men that claim
[56:17] to be men of this message that preach
[56:19] women have to wear flats
[56:22] they can't wear their hair this way they
[56:23] can't wear their hair that way they
[56:24] can't do this they can't do that and all
[56:27] that you know one brother invited me to
[56:29] come preach my wife told me if you ever
[56:30] go there you're going to go without me
[56:38] but they bring this
[56:39] they bring these teachings and beliefs
[56:42] on from other places and injected in
[56:44] here when brother brandon never preached
[56:46] those things
[56:58] maybe you'll see what a man's been
[56:59] through
[57:02] maybe the devil's twisting him up
[57:04] somewhere and caused him to do that
[57:06] though he's absolutely wrong before you
[57:08] leave the throne of god you'll feel
[57:10] sorry for that man and you'll be
[57:11] sympathizing with that brother
[57:14] you know don't be so quick to judge
[57:19] until you see what they've been through
[57:21] like that old saying walk a mile in
[57:23] their shoes
[57:26] don't be so quick to condemn other
[57:28] people
[57:31] you'll be sympathizing with your brother
[57:34] and when you get back down to earth
[57:35] again you'll go over to your brother and
[57:37] shake his hand
[57:38] because you know what he's been through
[57:41] you can't stand as a mortal in the
[57:44] presence of god and condemn anybody
[57:50] let he that's without sin cast the first
[57:52] stone
[57:53] in other words
[57:55] you can't stand as a mortal in the
[57:57] prison of god and condemn anybody i
[57:59] don't believe no sir not even if he's a
[58:02] rank sinner
[58:10] i gave you a testimony on sunday about
[58:12] how
[58:13] brother david horner got delivered
[58:17] well before that
[58:19] he was like a thorn in my side
[58:23] and
[58:24] he would do things
[58:26] to try to see if he could get at me
[58:31] and so
[58:32] he uh
[58:34] came down and and talked to some folks
[58:36] that lived on the road where i lived
[58:39] and uh asked them if he could go back
[58:41] and hunt in their woods
[58:44] and i knew he was just doing it to try
[58:46] to get at me because i see his truck
[58:47] when i drove by
[58:50] and so i knew he was just trying to do
[58:52] it to be me
[58:55] and i and so i i thought well i'm i'll
[58:58] tell you what i'm going to do
[59:00] i'm going to pray the lord does
[59:01] something to him
[59:05] you know david sometimes got that way
[59:08] david in the bible king david
[59:11] so i got down to pray and you know i
[59:14] could not pray anything bad on him
[59:19] but what i did say was lord
[59:22] when i first came here to dixon
[59:25] i used to pray
[59:27] that david would get a big deer
[59:31] so you could know
[59:33] that he could know you answer prayer
[59:36] and i said and you would give him a big
[59:37] deer
[59:39] i said so now lord i'm praying you won't
[59:41] let him get any deer
[59:45] so that he'll know you're a god that
[59:47] answers prayer
[59:50] and sometime later he spoke to someone
[59:53] and he said you know
[59:55] i haven't got a deer this year
[59:58] he said now i know something's going on
[1:00:00] he said somebody used to pray the deer
[1:00:02] on me and i think they're praying the
[1:00:04] deer off of me
[1:00:16] and what about a brother that's made a
[1:00:18] mistake
[1:00:19] though i say he's wrong sometimes he's
[1:00:21] accused or wrong
[1:00:22] when he's not wrong
[1:00:26] have you ever been there
[1:00:28] been accused of wrong
[1:00:31] and you're not wrong
[1:00:33] well don't go around trying to
[1:00:35] straighten the people out
[1:00:37] you'll just make a bigger mess up
[1:00:40] pray for the person that's accused you
[1:00:42] of wrong and you're not being wrong
[1:00:46] put it in god's hands
[1:00:54] but if he's wrong take him to the throne
[1:00:56] of god and stand there shoulder to
[1:00:58] shoulder with him knowing he's immortal
[1:01:02] maybe his destination
[1:01:05] rests upon our attitude toward him
[1:01:10] and when we come back from the throne of
[1:01:12] god we'll realize we're everyone guilty
[1:01:15] and we all need help one from the other
[1:01:23] you know god can take very bad people
[1:01:26] and make real good christians out of
[1:01:28] them
[1:01:33] the bible says about saul yet while he
[1:01:36] was breathing out threatenings against
[1:01:38] the church
[1:01:40] that god came and appeared to him in the
[1:01:43] pillar of fire
[1:01:47] brother brown said
[1:01:49] god the very god that can take a little
[1:01:51] hook nosed jew like paul angry and going
[1:01:54] down there putting all the christians to
[1:01:56] death under capital punishment and could
[1:01:58] change him and make him a lovely
[1:02:00] christian that same god lives tonight
[1:02:03] and can change any things anytime he
[1:02:06] takes a notion to do it he can change
[1:02:09] people
[1:02:15] turn with me to micah chapter 3.
[1:02:34] the book of my uh i'm sorry not micah
[1:02:37] malachi
[1:02:40] sorry i said wrong malachi chapter 3.
[1:02:48] in verse 8 through 10.
[1:02:52] will a man rob god
[1:02:55] yet ye have robbed me
[1:02:58] but you say wherein have we robbed thee
[1:03:02] in tithes and offerings
[1:03:04] ye are cursed with a curse for ye have
[1:03:07] robbed me even this whole nation
[1:03:10] bring you all the tithe into the
[1:03:11] storehouse that there may be meat in my
[1:03:14] house and prove me now we're here with
[1:03:19] saith the lord of hosts if i will not
[1:03:22] open up the windows of heaven and pour
[1:03:24] you out a blessing that there shall not
[1:03:26] be room enough to receive it
[1:03:34] so here's something
[1:03:36] that the bible says that god's saying if
[1:03:39] you do this i'm going to bless you
[1:03:45] if you give your tithe arms i'm going to
[1:03:47] bless you for it
[1:03:51] that doesn't mean that
[1:03:53] this isn't a message of prosperity
[1:03:56] that you're going to give your tithe and
[1:03:57] offerings and god's going to make you a
[1:03:59] millionaire
[1:04:02] if god was to only bless you with money
[1:04:04] that would only be temporal
[1:04:07] it would not be eternal
[1:04:09] it wouldn't have an eternal effect on
[1:04:11] your life
[1:04:12] but god's gonna bless you with things
[1:04:14] far beyond
[1:04:16] this world's riches
[1:04:19] he's gonna look friends
[1:04:21] my father owns a cattle on a thousand
[1:04:23] hills
[1:04:25] i don't got any need of this world's uh
[1:04:27] wealth i've got wealth
[1:04:31] it's like that banker that brother
[1:04:32] branham went and visited out west and he
[1:04:35] showed brother he's told brother brown
[1:04:36] you look this far as far as you can see
[1:04:39] i own all that land
[1:04:41] he said see that little town down there
[1:04:43] i own that town i own the bank in that
[1:04:46] town i own all the land out this way
[1:04:49] and he was showing all this to brother
[1:04:51] brandon brother and says how much do you
[1:04:53] own up there
[1:04:57] [Applause]
[1:05:09] i could stand here till in the morning
[1:05:12] telling you just what happened when i
[1:05:14] seen that and what condition i was in
[1:05:16] but just as loyal as i ever could i paid
[1:05:19] tithes
[1:05:20] and i took my own money from the church
[1:05:22] here from my campaigns and i'd give a
[1:05:25] tenth
[1:05:26] and i'd give it out to the ministers
[1:05:29] i believe in paying tithes it's one of
[1:05:32] god's blessings that's proven to be a
[1:05:35] blessing
[1:05:36] you say that's old testament it's of the
[1:05:40] new testament too
[1:05:43] turn me to first corinthians
[1:05:57] first corinthians chapter
[1:05:59] 9 verse 9
[1:06:02] through 11 for it is written in the laws
[1:06:04] of moses
[1:06:05] thou shall not muzzle the mouth of the
[1:06:08] ox that treadeth out the corn
[1:06:11] doth god take care for oxen
[1:06:14] or saith he at all together for our
[1:06:16] sakes for our sakes no doubt this is
[1:06:18] written that he that plowed should plow
[1:06:21] and hope and he that threshes
[1:06:24] in hope shall be partaker of his hope
[1:06:27] if we have sown unto you spiritual
[1:06:30] things
[1:06:31] is it a great thing if we reap your
[1:06:33] carnal things
[1:06:37] turn me to hebrews
[1:06:39] chapter 7
[1:06:40] verse 1.
[1:06:46] for this melchizedek king of salem
[1:06:48] priests the most high god who met
[1:06:50] abraham returning from the slaughter of
[1:06:52] the kings blessed him
[1:06:55] to whom also
[1:06:56] abraham gave a tenth part of all
[1:06:59] verse being
[1:07:00] by interpretation king of righteousness
[1:07:03] after that also king of salem which is
[1:07:06] king of peace
[1:07:07] without father without mother without
[1:07:10] descent
[1:07:12] having neither beginning of days nor end
[1:07:14] of life but made like unto the son of
[1:07:16] god abideth the priest continually
[1:07:19] and now consider how great this man was
[1:07:22] whom
[1:07:23] unto whom even the patriarch abraham
[1:07:26] gave a tenth of the spoils
[1:07:29] and verily they that are of the sons of
[1:07:32] levi who received the offerings
[1:07:35] office of the priesthood have a
[1:07:37] commandment to take tithe other people
[1:07:39] according to law that is of their
[1:07:41] brethren though they come out of the
[1:07:43] loins of abraham
[1:07:45] but he whose descent is not counted from
[1:07:47] them
[1:07:48] received tithes of abraham and blessed
[1:07:50] him that had the promise
[1:07:53] and
[1:07:54] without all contradiction the lest is
[1:07:57] blessed of the better
[1:08:00] and here men that die receive tithes but
[1:08:03] there he receiveth them of whom it is
[1:08:06] witness he
[1:08:08] liveth and as i may
[1:08:11] so say levi also who receiveth ties paid
[1:08:16] tithes in abraham for he was yet in the
[1:08:19] loins of his father when melchizedek met
[1:08:22] him
[1:08:29] hallelujah
[1:08:35] you know
[1:08:37] i
[1:08:41] when i preach i a lot of times give
[1:08:43] examples of my own life i'll tell you
[1:08:46] my faults and failures
[1:08:49] i'll tell you mistakes that i've made
[1:08:53] i'll tell you trials that i've went
[1:08:54] through
[1:08:56] how we've come out
[1:08:57] what the lord did
[1:08:59] and and i do all that to try to be a
[1:09:02] blessing
[1:09:04] uh
[1:09:06] preachers aren't superhuman
[1:09:08] they're flesh and blood just like you
[1:09:10] are
[1:09:12] you might think well they don't go
[1:09:14] through trials oh but yes they do
[1:09:18] it may be in different ways it may be
[1:09:20] over different things but they do go
[1:09:22] through it
[1:09:24] i'll tell you something pastoring a
[1:09:26] church is not an easy job
[1:09:29] and i i had a man one time you know
[1:09:32] accuse me said
[1:09:35] i was worse than an infidel
[1:09:38] said because i wouldn't work
[1:09:40] and i thought well i'd like for you to
[1:09:42] take my job for a day or two
[1:09:46] and just find out how much work it is
[1:09:50] it's
[1:09:51] it's a stressful
[1:09:55] and it takes a toll on you
[1:09:58] just like it took a toll on the lord
[1:10:00] jesus
[1:10:01] age of 32 they said
[1:10:04] you're not a man 50 years old
[1:10:06] and i said they thought he looked 50
[1:10:08] years old at the age of 32.
[1:10:13] it takes a toll
[1:10:15] there are positions in this world
[1:10:18] that people men can have women have to
[1:10:21] take a toll on it
[1:10:23] have you ever
[1:10:24] paid attention to
[1:10:26] some of the men who have been president
[1:10:29] look at him
[1:10:30] when they first went in office
[1:10:32] and then look at him after they've been
[1:10:34] in there four or eight years
[1:10:36] and see how
[1:10:38] much they've aged
[1:10:41] in that amount of time they've aged more
[1:10:43] than eight years
[1:10:46] they've aged about double that many
[1:10:48] times over
[1:10:49] because it's stressful
[1:10:54] it's the way it is with passion it's a
[1:10:56] stressful job
[1:10:58] and the thing is
[1:11:00] you've got the
[1:11:02] you're responsible for what you say to
[1:11:04] the people
[1:11:06] you're responsible for the souls of the
[1:11:08] people
[1:11:12] and so you res you
[1:11:14] you weigh out what you're going to
[1:11:17] what what you're going to say
[1:11:19] to the people
[1:11:21] one of the things i say is i
[1:11:23] i never tried to project my opinion as
[1:11:26] being the word of god
[1:11:29] i've got opinions about things
[1:11:31] i've got feelings about things
[1:11:34] but i don't preach them unless it's the
[1:11:36] word of god
[1:11:42] galatians chapter 3
[1:11:45] verse 6 says even as abraham believed
[1:11:47] god
[1:11:48] and it was accounted in him for
[1:11:50] righteousness
[1:11:52] know you therefore that they which are
[1:11:54] of the faith the same are the children
[1:11:56] of abraham
[1:11:58] and the scripture
[1:11:59] foreseeing that god
[1:12:01] would justify the heathen through faith
[1:12:04] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[1:12:07] saying in thee shall all nations be
[1:12:09] blessed
[1:12:10] so then they which are of the faith are
[1:12:14] blessed with faithful abraham
[1:12:19] some years ago my when my children were
[1:12:23] young
[1:12:25] and i was living up here
[1:12:27] i
[1:12:28] i remember
[1:12:30] specifically one week
[1:12:32] that uh one month
[1:12:35] that uh
[1:12:37] my wife and i we didn't have enough
[1:12:39] money to pay for our bills
[1:12:42] and we had set down and figured it out
[1:12:44] this is how much we owe this is how much
[1:12:46] we have
[1:12:48] we're this much short
[1:12:52] and we both said
[1:12:54] well the first thing when we're figuring
[1:12:56] this up we've got to take our tithe and
[1:12:58] offerings out
[1:13:01] and then see what we've got to work with
[1:13:05] and we said
[1:13:07] even though we couldn't make it
[1:13:10] meet the expense for that month said
[1:13:13] we're going to we're still going to give
[1:13:14] our tithe an offer
[1:13:17] and so we went to church that sunday
[1:13:19] morning
[1:13:23] and
[1:13:27] gave our tithe and offerings in worship
[1:13:32] and i went outside after church
[1:13:35] and i was standing out here on the walk
[1:13:39] and since he's done passed on i'm going
[1:13:41] to tell you who it was
[1:13:44] brother herb walked up to me
[1:13:47] and he said here brother jerry god told
[1:13:49] me to give this to you and he stuck
[1:13:50] something in my shirt pocket
[1:13:55] and uh
[1:13:56] i was
[1:13:57] i was too embarrassed to look at it
[1:13:59] standing there
[1:14:02] and so
[1:14:03] later
[1:14:04] we got in the vehicle to leave i thanked
[1:14:06] him for it we got in the vehicle to
[1:14:08] leave
[1:14:09] opened up it was a check
[1:14:13] and the check was wrote out for the
[1:14:15] exact amount to the penny
[1:14:18] of how short i was for that month
[1:14:22] now you tell me that god didn't tell him
[1:14:25] to do that
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:34] brother brown said this is one thing
[1:14:36] that's proven if you give your tithes
[1:14:38] and offerings you're going to get
[1:14:40] blessed
[1:14:41] god's going to take care of me
[1:14:44] i say it all the time i quote david of
[1:14:47] old
[1:14:48] i was once young but now i'm old
[1:14:52] but i've never seen the righteous
[1:14:53] forsaken or his seed begging bread
[1:14:59] and i'll tell you what
[1:15:01] there's been many times over
[1:15:05] brother herb keithley was a blessing to
[1:15:07] this congregation
[1:15:10] he blessed this church many times over
[1:15:13] he would do anything for anybody
[1:15:23] you know he was always buying and
[1:15:25] selling things
[1:15:28] he bought things that
[1:15:29] he could see the value in him
[1:15:32] he would sell them and and he would make
[1:15:35] money off
[1:15:38] i remember times of having something i
[1:15:40] needed some money and i'd call brother
[1:15:42] herb and say hey i've got something to
[1:15:44] sell
[1:15:46] and you know looking back over it i was
[1:15:48] just a young man then
[1:15:50] looking back from where i'm at now
[1:15:53] i'd say there's some times that he came
[1:15:55] and bought what i had when it wasn't
[1:15:57] worth nothing
[1:15:59] just to try to be a help
[1:16:06] well he's in a blessed place
[1:16:08] tonight
[1:16:16] my dad
[1:16:18] he helped me many times over
[1:16:24] my dad was always there for me
[1:16:29] there wasn't too much to ask
[1:16:32] you couldn't ask i could never ask too
[1:16:34] much of him
[1:16:38] he was always there to help me anytime i
[1:16:40] needed help
[1:16:42] in any way i needed
[1:16:48] sometimes when i'm studying i get to
[1:16:50] miss me
[1:16:52] so i'll be looking for a quote and i
[1:16:53] can't find it
[1:16:56] and when my dad was living i would call
[1:16:58] him up and say dad i'm looking for such
[1:17:00] a quote and he'd go and help me find it
[1:17:05] now i call it my brother
[1:17:16] we go through everything we go through
[1:17:18] as ministers
[1:17:20] to be a blessing to the people
[1:17:22] be held
[1:17:24] they're alive in some way
[1:17:26] that's how you be that your life in some
[1:17:28] way can touch the lives of others
[1:17:32] i gave you a testimony brother herb and
[1:17:34] how his life touched so many
[1:17:36] and that's what we want not
[1:17:39] that somebody would get up sometime and
[1:17:41] give us glory from the bullpen
[1:17:43] and that wasn't what i was doing
[1:17:45] if brother heard was still living i
[1:17:46] would have never said who it was
[1:17:50] because he wouldn't have wanted me to
[1:17:55] but i just wanted to share with you a
[1:17:57] truth to show you
[1:18:01] you can't give your you can't out give
[1:18:03] god
[1:18:05] if you give your time god will make sure
[1:18:07] you're taken care of you give your
[1:18:08] offerings got to make sure you're taken
[1:18:10] care of
[1:18:15] somebody has to pay for these lights
[1:18:18] somebody's got to pay for the different
[1:18:20] things and you know we can't
[1:18:23] god has given us
[1:18:25] enough to where we don't have to be in a
[1:18:27] run-down shack
[1:18:30] think about what god's done you can come
[1:18:32] here and sit comfortably
[1:18:36] there's heat in the winter there's air
[1:18:37] in the summer
[1:18:43] i remember when this group first started
[1:18:46] we were always setting up and taking
[1:18:48] down
[1:18:49] we first we went rented sister mercy
[1:18:52] remember we rented the room over at the
[1:18:54] family y
[1:18:56] we were always setting up equipment
[1:18:57] taking equipment down
[1:18:59] then we rented a church over here on
[1:19:01] gary avenue we went in of the afternoon
[1:19:05] in between their services
[1:19:07] and we we had to set up all of our pa
[1:19:10] equipment and take it all down we had to
[1:19:12] set everything up and take it down
[1:19:15] now
[1:19:16] you've got your own place
[1:19:19] you don't have to sit up and take down
[1:19:25] there was a pastor pastor adams that
[1:19:28] pastored the group that was here in this
[1:19:30] church before you bought it
[1:19:33] and
[1:19:35] you know they
[1:19:36] he was going to another had accepted an
[1:19:39] offer from another church to go past
[1:19:41] them there was only a few people left
[1:19:44] here in this assembly
[1:19:46] and he said well what are we going to do
[1:19:47] with the church and they decide they
[1:19:48] wanted to sell the church but they
[1:19:50] wanted to sell it to somebody that was
[1:19:51] going to use it as a church
[1:19:54] they said well who should we sell it to
[1:19:56] and he said well you know that group
[1:19:58] that's always renting the church off of
[1:20:00] us to come over here and baptize people
[1:20:04] so they're baptizing so many people they
[1:20:06] must need a church building
[1:20:12] my wife and i
[1:20:14] were the first ones to rent this church
[1:20:16] building i rented it to get married in
[1:20:19] in 1982.
[1:20:21] it didn't have these
[1:20:24] plaster walls in it then the block you
[1:20:26] see on the outside is what you saw on
[1:20:28] the inside
[1:20:31] and uh
[1:20:33] we needed we were just renting out of
[1:20:35] the family why and that so we had no
[1:20:38] place to
[1:20:39] to have our wedding so i i
[1:20:41] found out the pastor of this church then
[1:20:43] and came and talked to him and rented
[1:20:44] this church
[1:20:46] to get married in
[1:20:48] so this church holds a special place in
[1:20:50] mind in my wife's hearts anyway
[1:20:53] but now that you own it
[1:20:55] and it's yours it holds even a more
[1:20:57] special place in our hearts
[1:21:04] you know brother branham tells a story
[1:21:06] that was
[1:21:07] always has always been a blessing to me
[1:21:13] uh
[1:21:14] there was a
[1:21:16] man that was convicted in a town of a
[1:21:18] crime
[1:21:21] and
[1:21:21] he
[1:21:22] was related to most everybody in that
[1:21:25] town
[1:21:28] and so the people in that town told the
[1:21:30] judge
[1:21:31] that he better watch what he
[1:21:34] what he sentenced that man to because he
[1:21:36] was related to everybody in the town
[1:21:39] and the town kind of threatened him you
[1:21:41] know
[1:21:42] and
[1:21:43] the judge
[1:21:45] uh
[1:21:46] being a real fine judge of the law
[1:21:50] why he passed just sentence on the man
[1:21:54] for the crime he had committed
[1:21:57] and
[1:21:58] the people of the town begin to say
[1:22:00] we're not going to vote for you again
[1:22:03] said we hate you
[1:22:07] and they were screaming all kinds of
[1:22:09] things at him
