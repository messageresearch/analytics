[45:56] sister Linda here with us amen again
[45:59] and I was so tempted to have brother
[46:02] Ivon to speak but he said he was on

[46:11] times as well but we so appreciate

[46:15] any other visitors here God bless you
[46:18] and God bless you sir amen good to have
[46:20] you amen let's go here in the word thank
[46:22] you musicians I want to read here just
[46:26] um
[46:27] just a few places just a couple
[46:29] scriptures here in Ruth chapter 2 and I
[46:32] want to move forward
[46:35] into some places here in Ruth's life
[46:38] here this morning just some things the
[46:40] Lord just really
[46:42] has uh just pressed on our
[46:46] hearts as
[46:50] well in Ruth uh chapter 2 verse 15 and
[46:54] 16 we'll just read those two verses and
[46:56] let you be
[46:58] seated and the scripture said and when
[47:01] she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded
[47:05] his young men saying let her glean among
[47:09] the sheaves and reproach her not and let
[47:14] fall also some of the handfuls of
[47:17] purpose for her and leave them that she
[47:21] may glean them and rebuke her not amen
[47:25] may God bless you bless the reading of
[47:27] the word as you're being
[47:30] seated and I I want to just speak here
[47:34] this morning on just that of the
[47:37] handfuls of purpose and I want to read a
[47:41] scripture here uh in Leviticus chapter
[47:45] 19 uh we have it there on the board and
[47:49] this was a law that God had given when
[47:53] they would go in and begin to reap in
[47:56] the the land or to harvest and to gather
[47:59] in the Harvest from the crops that they
[48:03] uh had sowed and I want you to notice as
[48:05] it's read uh read read here or wrote
[48:09] when ye reap the Harvest of your land
[48:11] this is instruction to those who are
[48:13] harvesting it Thou shalt not wholly reap
[48:16] the corners of thy field neither shalt
[48:19] thou gather the gleanings of thy Harvest
[48:23] and thou shalt not glean thy Vineyard
[48:25] neither shalt thou gather every grape of
[48:27] thy Vineyard Thou shalt leave them for
[48:30] the poor and stranger I am the Lord your
[48:33] God God would even ask Israel uh this is
[48:37] really a whole separate thought but God
[48:38] would ask even he wants even what he has
[48:42] done for Israel God wanted Israel to
[48:46] even be a display of an extension of his
[48:49] Mercy to others and so I think that's
[48:52] the same thing that when we have
[48:54] received of the grace of God it's
[48:56] something that burns in our heart that
[48:58] we it just we want to that same grace
[49:01] extended to someone else we want to see
[49:04] that what God has done for us to be able
[49:06] to express that to someone else and say
[49:08] hey he did it for me he can do it for
[49:10] you and so when we look at that God's
[49:13] God always he wants to reflect himself
[49:17] through his people and that's truly the
[49:18] only the only ones that he can really
[49:21] reflect himself through we don't want to
[49:23] just he don't want to just reflect a
[49:25] portion but he wants to to reflect
[49:27] himself fully and Jo this would just be
[49:30] one of the attributes but I read that in
[49:32] regards to when Boaz in our text when
[49:36] Boaz had mentioned to the young men at
[49:39] that time and he told told them let her
[49:42] glean among the Sheep she being that of
[49:44] a stranger she would not have been
[49:46] allowed to glean among the sheep and
[49:50] then not only within that remember he
[49:52] said don't reproach her don't rebuke her
[49:54] for that I want you to I want you to
[49:57] allow her to do that and so so Ruth was
[50:01] not going to be confined to just the
[50:03] edges and what was you know just
[50:04] leftovers but I want her in the middle
[50:07] of the field I want her where the
[50:10] Harvest is going on sheaves that are
[50:12] being uh are are are there I want her to
[50:15] gather among those sheep and let fall
[50:19] also some of the handfuls of purpose for
[50:23] her now there's a lot of other maidens
[50:26] that are in the field but notice Boaz as
[50:28] we have read from the beginning of this
[50:31] scripture or chapter Boaz has already
[50:33] taken notice of her and now she is not
[50:37] aware of this conversation but here he
[50:40] himself is saying let handfuls of
[50:42] purpose fall for her and leave them that
[50:46] she glean them and rebuke her not now I
[50:49] tell you that's quite something because
[50:51] you know with the handfuls of purpose
[50:54] bohas could have just packed everything
[50:56] up and said Ruth just go ahead and just
[50:58] you don't need to labor you don't need
[51:00] to do anything you know I'll just send
[51:02] it all to your house and you just go and
[51:05] wait and but you know remember
[51:07] everything that we do remember if our
[51:10] faith the Bible says is without works
[51:13] it's dead so Faith itself there is an
[51:16] expression when we acting upon God's
[51:19] word God wants to see that we would act
[51:22] upon his word that faith in his word and
[51:25] I would say even here this morning that
[51:27] we could look at it and say Lord I I I
[51:29] just want my faith to be to rise into
[51:32] that place that there would be an action
[51:34] in my life that when I leave out of this
[51:37] service there's an action also that's
[51:40] taking place in my life and I'm walking
[51:43] in that of what you've made known and
[51:45] I'm walking to take to my life and see
[51:48] my life just completely uh transformed
[51:51] to match that word that I'm beholding so
[51:54] what a blessing that Ruth has been uh
[51:57] permitted to come and gather in the
[52:00] midst of the field and you know to think
[52:02] of it when we look at it here I want to
[52:04] read just a few places so we can get the
[52:07] perspective on the handfuls of purpose
[52:09] because it wasn't as though that Ruth
[52:11] would have a whole line of handfuls but
[52:15] there was she had to glean and she had
[52:17] to keep gleaning and going through these
[52:19] handfuls and brother Bram says it like
[52:21] this in Redeemer and Redemption he says
[52:24] you know he said to the Reaper you see
[52:27] the young lady that's behind you yes let
[52:29] the gleaning be heavy and said every
[52:33] once in a while now I want you to catch
[52:34] these phrases these are things brother
[52:36] Ram will say over and over with this
[52:38] handful of purpose every once in a while
[52:40] drop a handful of purp on purpose oh he
[52:43] says I love those handfuls don't
[52:47] you drop a handful on purpose that she
[52:50] could get it in other words Don't Put It
[52:52] Out Of Reach but put it to where it's in
[52:54] her reach you see that's the reality the
[52:57] word is not meant to be out of reach the
[53:00] word has come in our Reach This is why
[53:03] John in first John chapter 1 he said the
[53:06] word of God which we have seen which we
[53:09] have handled with our own hands this
[53:11] same word of life we declare unto you so
[53:15] this gospel is not Out Of Reach it comes
[53:18] to where you and I are at to lift us
[53:22] from our condition into what God has
[53:25] called us to be
[53:27] so I me just say it like this the gospel
[53:29] is never meant to be where it's zooming
[53:31] over top of the people's heads never
[53:34] because this is where that Paul even
[53:36] would write how that Satan had corrupted
[53:39] the Simplicity that is in Christ and so
[53:42] if you think about this even as like our
[53:44] brother rap was speaking last week was
[53:46] so good it's it's Christ that's who
[53:49] we're to focus on it's him it's him
[53:51] that's speaking to us it's him that
[53:53] we're looking to and God God never wants
[53:56] to make anything out of reach now let me
[53:58] balance that and put that in perspective
[54:01] that doesn't mean that we don't have
[54:03] anything to do with it remember in the
[54:05] message desperation the prophet tells us
[54:08] he said you know those he said if you're
[54:10] like born with a silver spoon in your
[54:12] mouth he said it's like you know it it
[54:14] it means nothing to you but the things
[54:16] that you have that mean something to you
[54:18] and you have to labor you have to give
[54:20] yourself to like it was with Hannah
[54:23] Hannah desired a child right is that
[54:27] right she desired one but notice even as
[54:30] she's faced this persecution she's faced
[54:32] it from the other woman that is there
[54:34] and the other you know there in in the
[54:36] home but notice her desperation before
[54:40] God brought out such a deep commitment
[54:43] out of her life that Lord that one that
[54:47] you would give to me Lord I will
[54:49] dedicate it to you I will dedicate it to
[54:52] the house of the Lord let me just say it
[54:54] to you like this when we can see that in
[54:57] the right way it's more than just our
[54:59] natural children we can apply it that
[55:01] way but to realize there's something
[55:04] deeper than just our flesh and our
[55:07] spirit it's that inner man where the
[55:09] Holy Spirit comes in to bring forth new
[55:12] life and have that and say Lord the
[55:15] commitment my desire Lord is I want to
[55:18] walk and dwell in the house of the Lord
[55:20] like David said all the days of my life
[55:23] I want to walk in your word Lord I just
[55:26] don't want a blessing I just don't want
[55:27] an anointing I Want You
[55:30] [Applause]
[55:32] Lord when Hannah was in that way
[55:34] remember God said he blessed her with a
[55:37] special blessing he blessed her with the
[55:39] prophet let me remind you the prophet
[55:41] itself is an interpreter of the word and
[55:43] the prophet even in this hour is the
[55:46] spirit of truth that has come to lead
[55:48] and guide you and I into all truth the
[55:51] same one who sent the message the same
[55:53] one who was there and anointed the
[55:55] messenger and delivered that message is
[55:58] the spirit of truth that's right here
[56:00] Among
[56:01] Us same Holy Spirit same Angel of the
[56:04] Lord that's drop a handful on purpose
[56:07] that she could get it oh he said how
[56:09] Ruth felt when she grabbed a whole
[56:12] handful the reaper would turn around and
[56:14] say it's all right it's all right when
[56:16] God gives us an oldfashioned pouring out
[56:19] of the Holy Spirit a handful do it on
[56:23] purpose I'm glad God still does things
[56:26] on
[56:27] purpose let me tell you the Holy Ghost
[56:29] doesn't come in our meetings just by
[56:31] accident the Bible said where two or
[56:34] three are gathered together in my name I
[56:36] will be in their midst it said he dwells
[56:38] in the Praises of his people David wrote
[56:41] it and said praise Waits For You in Zion
[56:44] oh God there's a people that know their
[56:47] God there's a people that are thankful
[56:49] for his mercy and Lord just one little
[56:52] whisp of you praise Waits For You in
[56:55] Zion I'm thankful for your mercies Lord
[56:58] this week I'm thankful for your grace of
[57:00] keeping me Lord thank you for the
[57:02] strength thank you for revealing
[57:04] yourself Lord praise waiteth for thee in
[57:07] Zion Oh
[57:09] God so do it on purpose so there's a
[57:12] purpose in everything there's a in other
[57:14] words there's a reason behind it God
[57:16] just don't do things just to be doing it
[57:19] he don't clown no he don't show show
[57:21] around you know even when you think look
[57:23] at it even when it came to the
[57:25] resurrection there he did not go go back
[57:27] and look at Herod and say what did I
[57:29] tell
[57:30] you he didn't go back to Pilot and said
[57:33] hey hey remember he didn't the Bible
[57:36] tells us in the book of Acts he made
[57:38] himself known to witnesses that were
[57:41] chosen
[57:43] beforehand you were ordained for God to
[57:46] reveal his resurrection his word this
[57:50] message in this
[57:52] hour and remember the word has not come
[57:55] in
[57:58] are you hearing me now when God sends
[58:00] his word his word will achieve Isaiah 55
[58:04] the purpose that it was sent to for
[58:07] it'll achieve it in the hearts and lives
[58:09] of God's people so there's a reason for
[58:12] everything God has a reason for the
[58:14] things that he does and even the way he
[58:17] does it right now so cuz he's not God's
[58:21] not an author of frustration and
[58:23] confusion now I want to read a quote
[58:25] here out of why Christ speak I I love
[58:27] this how brother Brandon would bring
[58:29] this uh in this message there's a lot
[58:32] more things to apply within this and
[58:36] it's dealing with even where brother
[58:38] brandham was talking about standing
[58:39] before that Obstacle of the Red Sea
[58:41] right and you know remembering that
[58:44] where God has brought you to and he said
[58:47] Moses had forgot that commissioning and
[58:50] brother b stands right here in 63 and
[58:52] says oh my here I am standing once God
[58:55] has committ commissioned you but you you
[58:57] have to be commissioned first is that
[59:00] right there's got to be a commissioning
[59:01] think about what we spoke a few weeks
[59:03] ago there's no commissioning No
[59:06] Authority without confession confession
[59:09] Isaiah 6 there's got to be confession
[59:11] first there's got to be a cleansing out
[59:13] of all sin and all unbelief then the
[59:16] Bible said after confession comes forth
[59:19] a sarant with a life coal to bring
[59:22] cleansing is that right then after the
[59:25] cleansing comes commissioning is that
[59:27] right so now once we've been
[59:30] commissioned there are obstacles there
[59:32] are things that we can stand or come
[59:34] before but God brings us back or to
[59:38] remember that God has never left
[59:42] us hallelujah are you hearing me now God
[59:46] has never left us you know because
[59:48] listen I I understand that we when we
[59:51] talk about feelings and emotions we are
[59:53] PE people who are made up of feelings we
[59:55] are people who are made up of emotion
[59:57] can you imagine how boring it would be
[59:59] without your
[1:00:00] feelings are you hearing me really but
[1:00:03] you see this is why that feelings you
[1:00:05] don't want to try to take take feelings
[1:00:07] and throw feelings out you want the Holy
[1:00:10] Spirit to govern your feelings Lord I
[1:00:13] want you to be the Lord Of My Life
[1:00:17] govern every desire and that it all
[1:00:21] point and reflect Jesus Christ so now
[1:00:23] brother R says it like this he says Lord
[1:00:26] Thy word lays up open on the pull pit
[1:00:28] and re realizing that someday it'll be
[1:00:30] closed for its last time then the word
[1:00:32] will be flesh we are we're grateful this
[1:00:35] time this morning and open to us watch
[1:00:38] these words by thy Holy Spirit the
[1:00:41] contents of this word that we shall read
[1:00:44] May the Holy Spirit teach us today the
[1:00:47] things that we ought to know and may we
[1:00:50] then in return listen closely to every
[1:00:54] word weigh it deeply and then may those
[1:00:58] who are listening by the way of tape may
[1:01:00] they listen close also now notice that
[1:01:02] may we listen close and weigh it deeply
[1:01:06] Hallelujah friends if there's any area
[1:01:08] that we in our lives that sometimes even
[1:01:11] with the busyness of life and the
[1:01:13] pressures and we're not going to escape
[1:01:15] as far as the pressures and and you know
[1:01:18] that that's one of the tricks of the
[1:01:19] lady oan Age The Prophet said one of the
[1:01:22] burdens for this age is sof soft Easy
[1:01:24] Living where where the expending of our
[1:01:27] time to where there's no longer a
[1:01:28] pressure no listen we're on there's a
[1:01:31] pressure that's all around but the
[1:01:33] secret to surviving and not want to say
[1:01:35] surviving overcoming is put God first in
[1:01:39] all things amen there's always going to
[1:01:41] be test there's always going to be trial
[1:01:43] there's always going to be pressure so
[1:01:45] let's not chase after a time of wow
[1:01:47] where there'll be no troubles there'll
[1:01:49] be nothing going on no that's coming
[1:01:51] that's in the Millennium God promised
[1:01:53] peace but peace will never have peace on
[1:01:56] Earth here but you can have peace in
[1:01:58] your life to know that him who is the
[1:02:00] Prince of Peace will bring you into that
[1:02:03] place of Peace So we want to have our
[1:02:05] eyes set on the right
[1:02:07] thing is that right we want to have our
[1:02:09] eyes set on the right thing so within
[1:02:11] this this is where we want within it
[1:02:14] Lord I want to evaluate and so getting
[1:02:16] back to my point is we we it's a time of
[1:02:19] reflection it should be when the word is
[1:02:21] coming forth we don't want to just let
[1:02:23] the word pass through us we want reflect
[1:02:26] on the word of God we want to weigh it
[1:02:29] deeply weigh it deeply way you mean
[1:02:31] weigh my bre no not weigh your brother
[1:02:33] not weigh your sister our own life let
[1:02:35] our own lives be weighed in the
[1:02:39] balance not the kind of Weights that you
[1:02:41] and I choose but a just
[1:02:44] weight is that right a just weight to
[1:02:47] where it's it's it's lined up and we can
[1:02:49] examining our lives and our hearts
[1:02:51] before God cuz we only passed this way
[1:02:54] once we we we don't we don't get another
[1:02:56] shot at this we only pass this way once
[1:02:59] even in this service it's that's where
[1:03:01] it's very vital and important we can
[1:03:02] take for granted well I'll be here
[1:03:04] another service you don't know that we
[1:03:07] don't know that let me tell you friends
[1:03:09] just as much as Faith Can Build unbelief
[1:03:12] can
[1:03:13] build we're being built one way or the
[1:03:16] other notice may we be able to catch
[1:03:20] what the holy spirit is trying to reveal
[1:03:22] to us I say God help us for we realize
[1:03:26] if he should anoint us then the
[1:03:29] anointing is not in vain prise God it's
[1:03:34] for a
[1:03:36] purpose that it might work to the good
[1:03:39] to the Lord and may our hearts and our
[1:03:41] understanding be open Lord so the
[1:03:44] anointing that is that comes when God
[1:03:47] comes to anoint us it is for a purpose
[1:03:51] remember brother Ram labored on this so
[1:03:53] much and he you know he had men on this
[1:03:56] side that we're making such criticism
[1:03:58] about you know the the the Pentecostals
[1:04:00] and things but yet brother BR said
[1:04:02] they're the closest to he didn't say
[1:04:03] they were he said they were the closest
[1:04:05] to that that real thing because you
[1:04:07] can't get any closer to the seed than
[1:04:09] the shuck is that right so he's
[1:04:12] identifying you oh well you know all I
[1:04:14] see him is run around and and jump and
[1:04:16] and and you know speak in tongues and
[1:04:17] this and that and brother BR said that's
[1:04:19] true but brother and then brother BR you
[1:04:21] know sometimes he'll stick up he said
[1:04:22] I'd rather have he said a little bit of
[1:04:24] wildfire than no fire
[1:04:26] but over and over brother Brandon was
[1:04:28] noticed as a prophet of God directing
[1:04:30] and looking at these things he said what
[1:04:32] it is he said they're blowing out all
[1:04:35] the steam out of the stack instead of
[1:04:38] putting it in the engine to make the
[1:04:41] wheels go on down the track so to say
[1:04:44] that what God is doing God does not come
[1:04:47] in a service that there would be one big
[1:04:50] boom of steam that would go out the
[1:04:52] Smoke Stack but God's desire when he
[1:04:55] comes with a handful of purpose is that
[1:04:58] it comes down on the
[1:05:01] inside and it puts us in motion it puts
[1:05:04] us in motion and it'll never the word
[1:05:06] when we receive the word it'll never
[1:05:09] ever put you backwards it'll never let
[1:05:11] you stay the same you realize even when
[1:05:13] we weigh it deeply take it into our
[1:05:15] lives and reflect and there's things
[1:05:17] that God deals with us and we say oh
[1:05:18] Lord Lord God I Surrender Lord mold my
[1:05:21] character Lord mold my life Lord God I
[1:05:24] confess my sins do you realize even in
[1:05:26] that you're not going backward you're
[1:05:27] going forward
[1:05:29] [Applause]
[1:05:31] Hall y sure thing now this understanding
[1:05:35] the Bible tells us I want to refer to a
[1:05:36] few places in Psalms
[1:05:39] 106 David says our fathers understood
[1:05:42] not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered
[1:05:45] not the multitude of thy mercies but
[1:05:47] provoked him even at the Red Sea uh even
[1:05:50] at the sea even at the Red Sea
[1:05:53] nevertheless he saved them for his Nam
[1:05:56] sake that he might make known his mighty
[1:05:59] power he might make his mighty power to
[1:06:02] be known now that's a powerful scripture
[1:06:05] there in verse in verse 7 they
[1:06:08] understood not thy
[1:06:10] wonders it was God working out these
[1:06:13] wonders now listen friends this wasn't
[1:06:16] just you know some healing Revival that
[1:06:18] was going on remember there was a
[1:06:21] message that came with this and that
[1:06:23] message was come out
[1:06:27] right any real message with God is never
[1:06:29] going to leave us in the same condition
[1:06:31] or Minister as though everything's all
[1:06:34] right it's going to call us out this is
[1:06:36] why that even as the message continues
[1:06:39] to come forth and be ministered to you
[1:06:41] and I it does not leave us in a place of
[1:06:44] complacency it's always calling us up
[1:06:47] higher because the quickening power of
[1:06:49] God Among Us it's a quickening that
[1:06:52] keeps on quickening us up from
[1:06:54] justification to Satan ification to the
[1:06:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the
[1:06:58] adoption it's more of the same Holy
[1:07:01] Spirit that's working all along it
[1:07:04] quickens as the prophet said until the
[1:07:06] moment we're changed Hallelujah it never
[1:07:10] it never is to stop lord that quickening
[1:07:12] that drawing closer to
[1:07:14] him but they not they didn't understand
[1:07:17] it because when another situation came
[1:07:19] up they looked at it and the Wonders the
[1:07:21] mighty wonders I mean the the the what
[1:07:23] was taking place in Egypt and yeah when
[1:07:26] they came to the Red Sea they you
[1:07:29] brought us out here to kill
[1:07:31] us we're just
[1:07:33] dead did you not see what God did back
[1:07:36] there amen did you not realize that that
[1:07:40] that the mightiest Nation upon the Earth
[1:07:43] and God went down and smoked the
[1:07:46] Tabernacles of
[1:07:48] ham let me bring it down to you and I
[1:07:50] personally the same God that took a care
[1:07:53] of your first birth amen hallelujah and
[1:07:57] if you've not fully seen that yet keep
[1:07:59] laying in his presence keep yielding to
[1:08:01] him because the same God that has spoke
[1:08:04] to your heart he'll take all unbelief
[1:08:06] out of your life as you'll Surrender
[1:08:09] Your Life to him your heart to him
[1:08:11] surrendering your will to him he'll take
[1:08:13] you all the way he comes to deal and to
[1:08:16] eradicate that first birth that first
[1:08:19] nature that's what God comes to do he
[1:08:23] can raise up what he said in Egypt let
[1:08:25] my son go that he may serve
[1:08:30] me so there's a purpose in this Psalms 1
[1:08:34] 11:6 he hath showed his people the power
[1:08:38] of His works that he may give them the
[1:08:41] heritage of the Heathen now God wasn't
[1:08:43] going to go in there and just clear it
[1:08:44] all out take a big old spiritual
[1:08:45] bulldozer and bulldoze out every problem
[1:08:48] in their life nope NOP every even when
[1:08:52] they crossed into the Land There was was
[1:08:55] a surrendering every battle that they
[1:08:58] faced there was a different battle plan
[1:09:01] but it was still Jehovah leading
[1:09:03] them are you with me sometimes we we
[1:09:06] have to get out there like Joshua Lord
[1:09:08] remember Joshua notice Joshua a type
[1:09:10] even not only of the last day messenger
[1:09:13] last day Ministry but brother BR would
[1:09:15] also call every believer a spiritual
[1:09:17] Joshua who's going to put the word first
[1:09:19] and to realize I'm don't want to put my
[1:09:21] ideas about this but Lord what do you
[1:09:23] want to do about this what do you say
[1:09:25] about this and God the way that God
[1:09:27] delivers it will be completely known
[1:09:30] that it had to be God to take care of it
[1:09:33] just like in the molding the shaping in
[1:09:34] our life the Deliverance the casting out
[1:09:37] of unbelief even to that of the new
[1:09:39] birth listen friends we have to stand
[1:09:41] and it's a realizing it's not what I
[1:09:43] have done but it's what God has done
[1:09:46] through a yielded
[1:09:49] vessel my so you know some of them
[1:09:51] didn't believe when they got there it
[1:09:53] was a mixed multitude you know yet God
[1:09:56] remained faithful to his word because
[1:09:58] there were some Believers in there am
[1:10:01] there was some Believers that them
[1:10:02] wonders and miracles were not
[1:10:05] falling just falling upon ground but
[1:10:10] there was some Believers in there that
[1:10:12] they were receiving these handfuls of
[1:10:14] purpose yeah it was moving in their
[1:10:17] hearts because the Bible would tell us
[1:10:19] even with Caleb and Joshua they were
[1:10:21] able to stand there steadfast even when
[1:10:24] what they said the congregation around
[1:10:27] them they were
[1:10:29] outnumbered it didn't matter how
[1:10:31] outnumbered they were they stood on
[1:10:34] God's
[1:10:35] word brother and sister that's not the
[1:10:37] DNA of Joshua and
[1:10:41] Caleb what was that it was because they
[1:10:45] had caught a hold of God and God had
[1:10:48] moved into their lives and even when the
[1:10:50] congregation pick up stones and was
[1:10:53] ready to Stone them it could not take
[1:10:55] take what was in their heart out of
[1:10:57] their heart but instead they tried to
[1:11:00] tell the people hey look what God has
[1:11:03] done look where God has brought us from
[1:11:05] hey look at the clothes you're wearing
[1:11:07] they're not threadborne hey look at the
[1:11:09] Mana that's Fallen hey the water that's
[1:11:12] that's come from the rock is trying to
[1:11:14] get us to look at the Supernatural
[1:11:16] That's right here Among Us God is not
[1:11:19] making accidents by sending his Spirit
[1:11:22] he's sending his Spirit his word on
[1:11:27] purpose when God makes a promise in his
[1:11:30] word that's God committing himself to
[1:11:32] his
[1:11:34] word is that right amen so now when we
[1:11:38] see this this is why even when you know
[1:11:41] Gideon would come to his
[1:11:44] place you know in here uh the angel of
[1:11:47] the Lord that followed the messengers
[1:11:49] message came and found him and said hey
[1:11:52] th Mighty Man of Valor Gideon you know
[1:11:55] looking around and who else is here but
[1:11:58] he asked the question if God's with us
[1:12:01] where's all of his
[1:12:03] miracles because why is all this
[1:12:05] befalling Us in other words why are we
[1:12:07] in this condition you see Gideon are you
[1:12:10] hearing me now Gideon was recognizing
[1:12:13] this was not just a test or a
[1:12:16] trial I hope you're hearing me now
[1:12:19] sometimes we have we need God's grace to
[1:12:21] bring the discernment between what's
[1:12:23] correction and what's a test and a trial
[1:12:25] that's right get it said if God be with
[1:12:27] us where be all the Miracles why is all
[1:12:30] this befalling us you know why because
[1:12:32] he knew when God the presence of God is
[1:12:35] with his people there is the blessing of
[1:12:37] God it doesn't matter how outnumbered
[1:12:39] you are if God's on your side you're
[1:12:42] more than enough for the
[1:12:44] match hallu Hallelujah you can take
[1:12:48] every opinion by a doctor that's against
[1:12:50] you but if God is on your side the Bible
[1:12:53] said if God be for us who can be against
[1:12:56] us Hall come on friends I'll take those
[1:13:00] odds any
[1:13:01] day you'll never find in the scripture
[1:13:04] where God had to have a
[1:13:06] multitude God never had to have well I
[1:13:08] got to have a mass so I can live a mass
[1:13:11] of people so I can live a Victorious
[1:13:13] life you don't need a mass of people to
[1:13:15] live a Victorious Life you just need to
[1:13:17] know Jesus Christ in the power of his
[1:13:20] resurrection and thou shalt Smite him as
[1:13:23] one man
[1:13:25] [Applause]
[1:13:26] hallelujah hallelujah that's so good Oh
[1:13:30] Glory we don't need a crowd we need his
[1:13:33] presence amen is that right go in this
[1:13:38] thy might what was thy might Gideon
[1:13:40] because he's looking that if we need the
[1:13:42] God who performs Miracles and let me
[1:13:45] tell you you can have in Miracles and
[1:13:47] miracles all around I my wife just
[1:13:49] shared with me here uh just of a of of a
[1:13:52] gentleman uh and it just made me cry
[1:13:54] when she shared it with me there later
[1:13:56] on Friday night of a man that as a
[1:13:58] pastor had lost his voice he had lost it
[1:14:01] and when he lost that voice he lost his
[1:14:03] voice he lost his livelihood he could
[1:14:05] not get hired anywhere and now years and
[1:14:08] years later and he was at the point he
[1:14:09] actually tried to take his life but it
[1:14:11] was restrained from taking it and and
[1:14:13] the church itself said hey we want you
[1:14:15] to come up and do a devotion and we want
[1:14:17] you to do a devotion on healing he said
[1:14:19] I can't talk they bought a special
[1:14:21] microphone for him and he you could hear
[1:14:23] his voice and as he begin to talk about
[1:14:25] healing all of a sudden there was
[1:14:27] something that opened up and you just
[1:14:29] hear him stop it they got the recording
[1:14:31] and it stopped and it opened up and he's
[1:14:33] talking he's referring to I'm the Lord
[1:14:36] that Health all my diseases it begins to
[1:14:39] weep on there he says something just
[1:14:40] happened in the congregation his wife
[1:14:42] different ones so let me just tell you
[1:14:44] something Miracles are not confined just
[1:14:47] to the Bride of Jesus
[1:14:50] Christ are you hearing me so the
[1:14:52] Miracles that we're talking about sure
[1:14:55] we believe in all that sure we witness
[1:14:57] that and we need the healing we need God
[1:15:00] in moving on the scene but friends let
[1:15:02] me tell you the greatest miracle that
[1:15:04] can ever take place is when God changes
[1:15:07] a person's life from Death unto life
[1:15:10] because if this body fails and gets sick
[1:15:12] it gets well it'll fail again but once
[1:15:15] that Soul has ever been healed it can
[1:15:18] never no more be sick that's the
[1:15:21] greatest
[1:15:23] Miracle so what Gideon is asking for God
[1:15:27] Among Us God in my
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:32] life Hallelujah I want the god that
[1:15:35] opened the Red Sea I've got some things
[1:15:37] that need parted in my life I've got
[1:15:40] some areas that I need to see the grace
[1:15:43] of God break back these things so I can
[1:15:46] walk
[1:15:48] forward that is so good Hallelujah and
[1:15:51] the kinsman redeemer once again brother
[1:15:53] Bram says how's she's gleaning for life
[1:15:56] he says oh how those angels He said
[1:16:00] those angels you Reapers every once in a
[1:16:03] while drop a handful on purpose now
[1:16:05] watch this don't let it all be so
[1:16:07] tiresome for
[1:16:10] her I think that's pretty powerful
[1:16:13] because you know sometimes as we're
[1:16:14] laboring it gets
[1:16:17] tiresome the Bible says be not weary and
[1:16:20] well doing for in due season you shall
[1:16:23] reap right
[1:16:25] that means that we're we're taking we're
[1:16:27] drawing our strength from the Lord
[1:16:29] because you know this is why that every
[1:16:31] time in our life every day is not a red
[1:16:34] letter
[1:16:36] day there's a lot of black letters in
[1:16:38] here right but if you want red letter
[1:16:41] days you got to follow the black letters
[1:16:43] the black letters Make Way for red
[1:16:45] letter
[1:16:46] days but a lot of times we don't like
[1:16:48] the black letter days don't sit that
[1:16:49] that's not spiritual no no remember
[1:16:51] before the fire fell God gave a word to
[1:16:54] elah but just because he gave that word
[1:16:57] did not mean the fire was going to come
[1:16:59] Elijah had to do and act upon what the
[1:17:01] word said do and that was wait till the
[1:17:04] evening time patience then it had to be
[1:17:07] assemble and rebuild the altar that's
[1:17:09] another thing then lay the wood in order
[1:17:12] another thing then lay the sacrifice in
[1:17:14] order and I want 12 barrels of water to
[1:17:17] be poured over it to show that it's not
[1:17:20] some hidden little trick I want you to
[1:17:22] water log it because I'm going to show
[1:17:25] that even when things are impossible
[1:17:28] that there's nothing impossible for the
[1:17:31] consuming fire of almighty God to come
[1:17:35] down and transform that
[1:17:38] life
[1:17:40] Hallelujah don't you love
[1:17:43] him don't let it be tiresome for us and
[1:17:46] watch this every once in a while let her
[1:17:49] hear a good message let a good power of
[1:17:52] the Holy Spirit cover her over once in a
[1:17:56] while to let her know that I'm still
[1:18:00] there so wait a minute does that mean
[1:18:03] that when I don't feel it and there's
[1:18:05] not a handful of purpose does that mean
[1:18:07] he's on
[1:18:08] vacation does that mean I need to go
[1:18:10] find where's he where'd he go where'd he
[1:18:12] go where where'd he go where'd he go hey
[1:18:14] so and so is he over there hey no he
[1:18:17] does it to let us know he's been the one
[1:18:21] watching over our lives the whole time
[1:18:25] amen because when he drops a handful of
[1:18:28] purpose it's for a specific reason and
[1:18:32] need in our lives am that's why he does
[1:18:36] it but sometimes this is where we can
[1:18:38] get under the the part and oh my you
[1:18:40] know uh but remember this is where we
[1:18:42] want to rest just like this field across
[1:18:45] the street which I know has been taken
[1:18:46] over but there's one down the road and
[1:18:48] you know what they had to sew that wheat
[1:18:50] the first thing they had to do or that
[1:18:51] the soybeans they had to disc up that
[1:18:52] ground right right right right they had
[1:18:55] to disc it up if you want a crop you got
[1:18:57] to break it up this is why the Bible
[1:18:58] even talks about you want to see more of
[1:19:00] God in your life break up the F ground
[1:19:02] right keep your life just be a be a
[1:19:04] channel that's clean and clear keep
[1:19:06] everything confessed and under the
[1:19:08] blood are you hearing me Church you see
[1:19:12] and then notice then there's got to be
[1:19:14] seed that's sewn and then that there's
[1:19:15] got to be watering and you know the
[1:19:18] Harvest comes in its
[1:19:20] time and when the Harvest comes you want
[1:19:23] to be faithful all the way through
[1:19:24] through amen not just showing up where
[1:19:27] there's a
[1:19:28] harvest you understand me you don't want
[1:19:30] to just run from this field oh there's a
[1:19:32] harvest here I'll go to this field
[1:19:33] there's a heart you want to stay and be
[1:19:35] faithful to what God has called you to
[1:19:38] do amen is that all right notice he said
[1:19:42] do some kind of a healing amongst her
[1:19:44] that realize that only God can do is
[1:19:47] that right show some kind of a sign or a
[1:19:49] wonder that she'll know that I'm in her
[1:19:52] midst oh brother Braham said don't you
[1:19:55] find like to find them handfuls notice
[1:19:57] what it's all about brother BR keeps
[1:19:58] saying it show that I'm in her midst
[1:20:01] show her that I care show her eye it's
[1:20:04] about him it's about him amen don't you
[1:20:09] like to find them handfuls so you mean
[1:20:12] that the handfuls it didn't just like
[1:20:13] hey hey come over here here's a handful
[1:20:15] no you have to
[1:20:17] seek and you shall
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:20] find knock and it shall be open unto you
[1:20:25] ask that shows our faith that's why
[1:20:29] there's things remember the gospel is
[1:20:30] not going over our head but there's
[1:20:31] things that God deals with our life that
[1:20:33] we take out of here and we start
[1:20:35] beginning we go into prayer and Lord I
[1:20:38] it moves us into that place of seeking
[1:20:40] for that word to become flesh in our
[1:20:43] lives that's God does that
[1:20:47] purposely he does it purposely a handful
[1:20:51] of fresh barley Lord do something that
[1:20:53] he used to do
[1:20:55] something that he know we know he does
[1:20:59] he's the lord of the Harvest he's the
[1:21:01] only one can drop the handful oh brother
[1:21:03] B said I've commanded the angels to go
[1:21:05] down to that meeting this morning I want
[1:21:07] them to do a certain certain thing I've
[1:21:09] commanded them and they'll do it now
[1:21:12] remember the Bible tells us that they
[1:21:17] the Lord was with them in Mark 16
[1:21:22] confirming working with the and
[1:21:24] confirming the word with signs following
[1:21:28] prise Lord when you look through the
[1:21:30] book of Acts now the book of Acts 26
[1:21:34] chapters is that right 26 chapters but
[1:21:39] the book of Acts being sorry 28 chapters
[1:21:41] that's why you didn't say
[1:21:46] right but it didn't take place in 28
[1:21:51] days see sometimes our our thinking of
[1:21:54] you had another book of Acts behind it
[1:21:56] we're thinking every single
[1:22:00] day 32 years was the book of
[1:22:03] Acts there was laboring in the book of
[1:22:05] Acts there was
[1:22:07] persecutions hate to say it
[1:22:12] misunderstandings yeah see God listen
[1:22:15] God didn't pull his hands back and say
[1:22:16] oh no Satan you can't test him he
[1:22:18] allowed he allowed it to be tested just
[1:22:21] like the mixed multitude that came out
[1:22:23] God permitted all those things but
[1:22:25] remember the signs and wonders were done
[1:22:27] there were there were no there were many
[1:22:29] I I don't know how many but how many
[1:22:31] that would have maybe seen the signs and
[1:22:33] wonders that were done through Paul but
[1:22:36] yet not all of them were converted not
[1:22:38] all of them came along and walked on
[1:22:40] into the light of the Gospel but there
[1:22:42] were those who were ordained to life
[1:22:45] that even when there were some that were
[1:22:47] blocked away from hearing the word but
[1:22:50] God would move in such a supernatural
[1:22:52] way to get their attention the Bible
[1:22:55] says concerning Paul remember in the
[1:22:57] work of an apostle the Bible said there
[1:22:59] were special Miracles done by the hand
[1:23:04] of Paul is that right for what purpose
[1:23:06] what reason was it to draw attention to
[1:23:09] Paul not at all but God allowed that and
[1:23:12] gave that so what that there would be
[1:23:14] those who would recognize hey who is
[1:23:17] among us this is more than a man that's
[1:23:20] Among Us here it's the Living God that's
[1:23:22] Among Us no wonder Paul could stand
[1:23:24] there on Mars Hill when they had all of
[1:23:26] their altars and he found one that said
[1:23:29] to the unknown God Paul stood right
[1:23:31] there and he introduced him not only
[1:23:34] introduced him but he unfolded his name
[1:23:37] to them he revealed Christ to
[1:23:41] them Hallelujah you see the purpose of
[1:23:44] God coming and delivering the word is so
[1:23:47] that the people might come into a
[1:23:49] relationship with almighty God this is
[1:23:52] why you had a church started in Corin
[1:23:54] Corinthians this is why you had the
[1:23:55] galatian church and eventually there
[1:23:57] were multitudes of churches as even it
[1:23:59] says in Philippians 1 and to the
[1:24:02] churches that are throughout there were
[1:24:04] churches even as Peter would write even
[1:24:06] to the strangers elects that are in
[1:24:09] caposa Bethania all of those around the
[1:24:11] word of God notice god listen even in
[1:24:14] their comfort
[1:24:16] zone God knew if he didn't let
[1:24:18] persecution come they would have been
[1:24:21] one communal complex
[1:24:24] are you hearing me now God never
[1:24:26] intended for his word to be
[1:24:30] communal it should be the holy spirit in
[1:24:32] us that is called brings about a
[1:24:35] Brotherhood one with another is that
[1:24:37] right let Brotherly Love continue it
[1:24:39] ought to be the love of God unites us
[1:24:41] together around the word of God and it
[1:24:43] will if it's a love of God it'll unite
[1:24:45] us around the word of God not around our
[1:24:47] feelings not around our favorite this or
[1:24:49] favorite that we'll be United around the
[1:24:52] word of God we might have our favorite
[1:24:54] we might have this but never should our
[1:24:56] favorites or anything about us be placed
[1:25:00] above God's
[1:25:01] word are you hearing me we've seen that
[1:25:03] example I could give examples through
[1:25:05] the prophet's life but notice there's a
[1:25:07] reason why God would send his word it's
[1:25:10] it's turning the hearts and moving lives
[1:25:13] into a union with him this is why Paul
[1:25:16] would even write of it in in Hebrews
[1:25:18] chapter 2 and he would say in verse
[1:25:20] three how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:25:23] so great a salv ation and the prophet
[1:25:25] would pick that phrase up and said once
[1:25:28] the word he said said like you've been
[1:25:29] prayed for the word has been delivered
[1:25:32] he said if you get away from the word
[1:25:34] you get away from your healing you get
[1:25:36] away from your strength but we want to
[1:25:38] stay with the
[1:25:41] word which at the first began to be
[1:25:44] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[1:25:46] unto us by them that H him God also
[1:25:50] bearing them witness both with signs and
[1:25:52] wonders and with d Miracles and Gifts of
[1:25:55] the Holy Ghost according to his own will
[1:25:58] for what purpose was to bring the people
[1:26:01] to the realization of Hebrews 13:8 he's
[1:26:05] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:26:08] and
[1:26:11] forever now think about
[1:26:13] this anytime there's a reality where God
[1:26:17] moves like when they saw in John
[1:26:21] 6 motto they seen the same God who had
[1:26:25] moved through Elisha when there was a
[1:26:28] feeding of the multitude in Elisha's day
[1:26:31] they seen that same God right here on
[1:26:33] display when those Loaves and Fishes
[1:26:37] were taken and multiplied and and and
[1:26:39] here there were baskets to be taken up
[1:26:42] now the disciples they were witnessing
[1:26:44] all this as well I mean everybody else
[1:26:46] too listen let me tell you something
[1:26:47] everybody that day was a partaker of a
[1:26:50] miracle right are you hearing me
[1:26:53] everybody was was a partaker of a
[1:26:54] miracle that day but it didn't have the
[1:26:57] same effect on
[1:26:59] everybody for some people it just got
[1:27:01] their bellies
[1:27:03] full now let me bring it on down when
[1:27:06] Jesus came remember he's had them
[1:27:08] following him they were they were coming
[1:27:11] after him and Jesus said you're not
[1:27:12] coming after me because of of who I am
[1:27:16] you're coming after me because you ate
[1:27:18] and you were
[1:27:20] full brother Samuel what are you saying
[1:27:22] that is there is some in your heart that
[1:27:25] looks at on the handfuls of purpose and
[1:27:28] says that is good but there is more in
[1:27:32] Christ for me there's more it's about
[1:27:35] him it's not just about being satisfied
[1:27:37] my goodness I was in a good service and
[1:27:40] praise God glory to God I got up and I
[1:27:42] did this or I did that and then that's
[1:27:44] it oh my that's it that's the same thing
[1:27:48] the message came to correct the
[1:27:50] Pentecostals
[1:27:51] on are you hearing me because they
[1:27:54] argued they argued their experience
[1:27:57] against the
[1:27:58] word well I've spoken tongues I've done
[1:28:01] this brother brand will sit there and
[1:28:02] tell us he said you try to tell a woman
[1:28:05] that's wearing shorts and the Holy
[1:28:06] Spirit has allowed her to speak in
[1:28:08] tongues you try to tell her she's wrong
[1:28:10] why she's going on experience rather
[1:28:13] than the word the holy spirit is not an
[1:28:16] unclean Spirit the Holy Spirit and the
[1:28:19] word are
[1:28:22] one we can't have the Holy Ghost and
[1:28:25] disagree with one part of God's
[1:28:28] word we might have it in our spirit but
[1:28:31] we don't have it in the soul that'll
[1:28:34] bring a change to where there's a match
[1:28:36] piece that's
[1:28:38] made that's why this word
[1:28:41] came are you hearing me not against
[1:28:44] dancing not against shouting I mean
[1:28:45] obviously I can preach on this I'm not
[1:28:47] against that but I tell you one thing
[1:28:50] we're not reaching for that
[1:28:54] that's not your
[1:28:55] goal are you hearing me that's not the
[1:28:58] goal that doesn't even mean wow that's a
[1:29:00] good service that is not what's a good
[1:29:03] service is when our lives have received
[1:29:06] a handful of purpose and it works out of
[1:29:09] our
[1:29:11] life if it becomes just about the CH
[1:29:14] coming to the house of God and all that
[1:29:16] happens here we become denominational
[1:29:21] Christians
[1:29:22] Traditions come on friends this word is
[1:29:25] not about a tradition this word was for
[1:29:28] Christ to live in
[1:29:33] flesh you might cry you might run you
[1:29:36] might shout it may not even be the
[1:29:38] service for
[1:29:42] that that's right good but I'll tell you
[1:29:45] one thing when there comes a handful of
[1:29:48] purpose however God has made
[1:29:50] me I like to feel it amen
[1:29:55] I I might cry a little bit I might
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:29:58] say sometimes it gets a hold of me I
[1:30:00] want to say it out here but I just can't
[1:30:02] say it I just bring it in here and and
[1:30:04] Lord you know this is sure good Lord but
[1:30:07] then there's other times my goodness
[1:30:08] when it begins to strike and my feet go
[1:30:10] to tapping oh my a handful of
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:16] purpose so everywhere you know God moves
[1:30:20] the prophet said in the message
[1:30:21] expectation wherever God moves loves
[1:30:24] anytime Through the Bible you'll see
[1:30:26] healing miracles signs and wonders he
[1:30:29] leaves a behind him a track of the
[1:30:34] supernatural
[1:30:37] Hallelujah now you
[1:30:40] see you see when God sends a
[1:30:44] Revival you know this is where the
[1:30:47] Prophet is he would talk about that
[1:30:49] handful of purpose oh every once in a
[1:30:51] while and he'll talk about a Revival
[1:30:54] but you know a Revival itself a true God
[1:30:58] called Revival it calls us back to the
[1:31:01] word is that right it calls us back to
[1:31:05] the word now now listen friends this is
[1:31:07] where I I'm not asking you I'm not
[1:31:09] trying to upset where you're at but I'm
[1:31:11] just saying in this way sometimes we can
[1:31:13] become so complacent because well I know
[1:31:15] who the messenger is and I know this and
[1:31:18] I said here in the message church and I
[1:31:20] can quote this and we become so leaning
[1:31:22] upon that in instead of realizing who's
[1:31:25] in our
[1:31:28] midst this message never came to make us
[1:31:31] Idol
[1:31:33] worshippers are you hearing me this is
[1:31:35] why the prophet could preach in the
[1:31:37] message all things he said you
[1:31:39] Pentecostals have taken the genuine
[1:31:41] articles of God speaking in tongues all
[1:31:43] those other things he said you have made
[1:31:46] a tradition out of
[1:31:48] it why because it had to happen every
[1:31:51] single
[1:31:52] service they be dependent upon emotion
[1:31:56] instead of the word of God if there's
[1:31:58] anything that ought to bring emotion it
[1:32:00] ought to be the
[1:32:02] word we don't need the music I
[1:32:04] appreciate music but there's one thing
[1:32:07] it ought to be the word that puts us
[1:32:09] into action it ought to be the spirit of
[1:32:11] God moving in our life that calls us
[1:32:14] Beyond
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:18] unbelief
[1:32:19] Hallelujah it gets us away from the
[1:32:22] reasonings of man this is where Calvin
[1:32:24] failed the prophet will spend time with
[1:32:26] this on the seals and Calvin had got to
[1:32:29] such a place on eternal security to he
[1:32:31] looked at it talking about
[1:32:33] predestination eternal security we don't
[1:32:35] need revivals no
[1:32:39] more and he got off because let me tell
[1:32:42] you something with a predestinated seed
[1:32:46] it's going to take the quickening power
[1:32:48] of almighty God to come down on that
[1:32:50] seed it's going to take the inspiration
[1:32:53] of the the Holy Spirit of his word being
[1:32:55] poured out in that season for that hour
[1:32:59] that's why a Luther's message won't take
[1:33:01] effect on you Wesley's message
[1:33:03] Pentecostal listen this is why a
[1:33:04] Pentecostal message won't take effect on
[1:33:07] you it has to be a brid time message it
[1:33:10] had to be a message of the son of
[1:33:13] man as a matter of fact the prophet says
[1:33:15] it in 1958 the call out he said the son
[1:33:19] of man is even being revealed now 1958
[1:33:23] even being revealed now he said this is
[1:33:25] what you should do run to the middle of
[1:33:28] the field of God's grace and ask for his
[1:33:31] Mercy what are you saying Ruth you don't
[1:33:33] got to go to the corners run to the
[1:33:36] middle of the field of God's
[1:33:43] grace but that predestinated seed has
[1:33:47] got to be quickened it's got to have
[1:33:48] this is why every generation has to have
[1:33:50] their opportunity a fresh chance at the
[1:33:53] world of God there's got to be a new
[1:33:55] birth that's why listen friends that's
[1:33:57] why with the seed of almighty god listen
[1:34:00] when we talk about sons of God do you
[1:34:02] realize if the reason that that is
[1:34:04] called like that in 1 John 3:1 beloved
[1:34:08] no what considering a what love that is
[1:34:10] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:34:13] called the sons of God you know what it
[1:34:14] is it's letting you know who you are
[1:34:17] it's letting us know who we are but
[1:34:19] remember we have to come through the
[1:34:21] same process we have to come into that
[1:34:24] place to become a Vindicated manifested
[1:34:28] Son of
[1:34:29] God is that right the prophet taught us
[1:34:32] in the opening of the seals and then on
[1:34:34] he said not only must these seals be by
[1:34:36] by divine revelation but by Divine
[1:34:38] Vindication and the prophet will work
[1:34:40] those two the rest of the way through
[1:34:42] the message because whatever has been
[1:34:44] revealed now we're looking to that Lord
[1:34:48] it would become
[1:34:49] Vindicated in my
[1:34:52] life there was a man John 5 he was down
[1:34:56] there by the the pool of Bethesda you
[1:34:58] know the story probably most of us do he
[1:35:01] was laying down there impotent not a it
[1:35:03] want a disease or something was going to
[1:35:05] you know take him out of here he'd been
[1:35:06] there for 38 years but the Bible would
[1:35:09] tell us why was he laying there because
[1:35:13] there'd be a visitation there every
[1:35:16] season
[1:35:19] yes now I want you to think about this
[1:35:25] the Bible said verse four for an angel
[1:35:27] went down at a certain season
[1:35:30] right into the pool and troubled the
[1:35:33] water whosoever then first after the
[1:35:36] troubling water stepped in was made
[1:35:38] whole of whatsoever disease he had you
[1:35:40] know what it was that kept him there
[1:35:43] Faith because when you read on down the
[1:35:46] scriptures he had every reason in the
[1:35:48] world to get up or to however he would
[1:35:51] go roll or whatever more because he said
[1:35:54] when I go to get in there before I go to
[1:35:56] get in somebody steps in ahead of me you
[1:35:58] know how much discouragement that how
[1:36:00] many times he had been
[1:36:02] discouraged you know matter how many
[1:36:04] times the devil had told him you might
[1:36:06] as well pack it
[1:36:09] up you know oh yeah you know he's coming
[1:36:12] but look somebody always gets it ahead
[1:36:13] of you but there was a
[1:36:16] faith that held him there you know why
[1:36:20] he said I've seen handfuls of purpose
[1:36:22] come in here and there is mine is going
[1:36:25] to come one of these days hallelujah are
[1:36:29] you hearing me now him staying right
[1:36:31] there was a confession of his faith in
[1:36:34] God's
[1:36:35] [Applause]
[1:36:37] word his works exhibited his faith
[1:36:41] brother let me tell you the one that
[1:36:43] sent all the messengers the one that
[1:36:45] sent all of them here he came down and
[1:36:48] he came he stepped over this one stepped
[1:36:50] over that one stepped over this one and
[1:36:52] he said will thou be made whole and he
[1:36:54] began to explain to him I can't get down
[1:36:57] there when I go to get down there
[1:36:58] somebody steps in front of me he said
[1:37:00] rise up and take up thy bed and
[1:37:04] walk he couldn't get to the water but
[1:37:07] the one who sent the Angels
[1:37:10] Came to where he
[1:37:14] was a handful of
[1:37:18] purpose Hall and he became a
[1:37:22] testimony he did
[1:37:25] this is why the prophet said every once
[1:37:26] in a while out of the message job every
[1:37:29] once in a while drop just a little
[1:37:31] handful on purpose just a little handful
[1:37:33] on purpose a little oldfashioned Revival
[1:37:37] that stirs up the water a little bit
[1:37:39] drop a little on purpose oh he said
[1:37:41] don't you like those little handfuls
[1:37:43] along the road I do Lord I love them I
[1:37:46] love them I love them Lord wow it's
[1:37:49] encouragement to me oh brother sammon
[1:37:52] you're just a sign follower no no signs
[1:37:53] follow me but I when I recognize him it
[1:37:56] just lets me know he's been here the
[1:37:57] whole
[1:38:00] time can I tell you a little Story I
[1:38:02] Heard brother Daryl Ward tell he
[1:38:05] probably told it here but it just
[1:38:06] blessed me so much he said here when
[1:38:08] they have they take them them Scouts
[1:38:10] those e those Indians out and when the
[1:38:12] man when he's going to become a man his
[1:38:14] daddy takes him out to a secret place
[1:38:15] that only his daddy knows and he puts
[1:38:17] him there on a rock and he binds up his
[1:38:19] hands binds up his feet but he binds it
[1:38:20] in a way so he can get out of it but
[1:38:22] then the last thing is is he puts this
[1:38:25] around his
[1:38:27] eyes and then he has to stay there all
[1:38:29] night don't get scared when not going to
[1:38:31] do it to
[1:38:33] you but he so at night you could hear
[1:38:36] the cricking maybe the crack is that a
[1:38:38] bear oh is that there ain't no light
[1:38:40] switch there ain't no light switch oh
[1:38:42] what is
[1:38:43] that and finally in the morning when the
[1:38:46] sun raay as soon as that Sun at the
[1:38:49] rising of the sun it begins to hit his
[1:38:53] his face he then can take it down and
[1:38:57] when he takes it down then he's taking
[1:38:59] this off and he takes it off and about
[1:39:01] that time he looks and his daddy has
[1:39:03] been sitting behind him the whole
[1:39:08] time so let me tell you God bringing
[1:39:11] Sons into sunship bringing you and I in
[1:39:13] maturity he's right there the whole time
[1:39:15] when there's a handful of purpose that
[1:39:17] he comes and you think man that's just
[1:39:19] what was going in in school he's letting
[1:39:21] you know he's walking with you down
[1:39:23] those School Halls he's letting you know
[1:39:26] that I'm right there on the job with you
[1:39:28] God doesn't stop at the church door you
[1:39:31] are his
[1:39:33] church Hallelujah you are his Tabernacle
[1:39:37] you are his dwelling place and he lives
[1:39:40] in you and worships
[1:39:42] [Applause]
[1:39:44] hallelujah
[1:39:46] hallelujah all them little handfuls
[1:39:48] along the road the promises of God that
[1:39:50] just kind of jerks you up a little bit
[1:39:53] gives a little bit of that life that
[1:39:54] come out of the field of God I'm so glad
[1:39:58] for that encouragement and
[1:39:59] refreshing aren't you glad for that
[1:40:02] aren't you glad he renews our our youth
[1:40:04] Like an Eagle brother BR said sometimes
[1:40:06] we get all kind of down and stale and
[1:40:08] you know and all that once the Holy
[1:40:09] Spirit comes renews us again oh thank
[1:40:13] God with a renewing experience of our
[1:40:15] youth thank you Lord sometimes I mean we
[1:40:17] can get so well forgive me we can get so
[1:40:21] old and grouchy and contener and we
[1:40:23] forget about the grace of God now I'm
[1:40:24] not just talking about old and age
[1:40:26] sometimes we you know what happens when
[1:40:28] you get away from the presence of God
[1:40:30] the prophet said you get
[1:40:32] prickly in the message 1965 of Shame you
[1:40:36] get out from the presence of God he's
[1:40:37] talking about coming to the house of God
[1:40:38] gathering around with other believers he
[1:40:40] said when you get out from under the
[1:40:41] presence of God where the spirit of God
[1:40:43] is coming out you begin to get sticky
[1:40:46] and Pokey and pricky and everything oh
[1:40:48] everything bothers
[1:40:51] me you know what you need a good dose of
[1:40:53] a handful of
[1:40:55] purpose did just be honest say Lord drop
[1:40:58] a handful right here I need a handful of
[1:41:00] purpose so I can get right back to the
[1:41:02] purpose that I'm to be I'm to be a son
[1:41:05] and daughter of God God never made me to
[1:41:07] frown and worry and be sad and contener
[1:41:09] us the Bible said happy is the people
[1:41:12] whose God is the
[1:41:16] Lord
[1:41:18] hallelujah oh my hallu
[1:41:25] amen let's just close here every now and
[1:41:28] then the prophet would say he would use
[1:41:32] those phrases every once in a while Lord
[1:41:36] every now and
[1:41:37] then let it fall you know what happened
[1:41:41] we would become so common among us you
[1:41:46] know I listen friends I every service is
[1:41:48] really unique it is I I don't know how
[1:41:50] else to explain that
[1:41:53] you know there's certain things maybe
[1:41:55] certain things that I can look at that
[1:41:56] I've got to preach I'm like wow man this
[1:41:58] is and then there's other times I look
[1:42:00] at oh lord lord is there another you
[1:42:03] could send in dear
[1:42:04] Lord so there's but that's how it is
[1:42:07] even in our Christian walk when it comes
[1:42:08] to living there's parts of the word hey
[1:42:11] it's no problem love
[1:42:13] everybody but it's when you really have
[1:42:15] to do that to die to
[1:42:19] ourselves that's that that's when it
[1:42:21] really comes down to living and we got
[1:42:22] to died to our own will so we we all
[1:42:25] face that in one form or another but if
[1:42:28] if it came in such a way every single
[1:42:32] time it would become so common to us but
[1:42:35] God knows just how to tailor each
[1:42:38] service every part that we're at because
[1:42:41] God wants to drop those handfuls of
[1:42:43] purpose where we can take that purpose
[1:42:46] up and say thank you Lord
[1:42:49] amen thank you
[1:42:51] Lord now let me close close with this
[1:42:53] I'm closing but I want to leave you with
[1:42:55] this right here if you look on down in
[1:42:58] your scriptures there in Ro Ruth 2:1
[1:43:01] 17 and I try to be as quick as I can
[1:43:03] here but I want to leave you with this
[1:43:06] here's these handfuls of purpose in
[1:43:08] verse 17 it says she gleaned in the
[1:43:11] field until even and beat out that she
[1:43:15] had gleaned and what is about an Ean of
[1:43:17] barley so not only did she have to pick
[1:43:19] it up she had to beat it out had to
[1:43:22] winnow it you know she had to do she had
[1:43:24] to and
[1:43:26] it the Chuck and all those other things
[1:43:28] would just kind of go with the wind
[1:43:30] because what she was going to take home
[1:43:31] was seed Hallelujah that's so good are
[1:43:34] you hearing me this is why there's
[1:43:36] things that even as we're listening to
[1:43:37] the preaching of the word what you want
[1:43:39] to take home it's not brother Samuel you
[1:43:40] want to take home
[1:43:43] Christ are you here are you hearing me
[1:43:45] that's what you want to take home you
[1:43:46] want to take home Christ so here how
[1:43:48] that here you're gathering in that word
[1:43:50] and here it is she's beating it out my
[1:43:52] she just have to labor to bring it in
[1:43:54] but she's got to beat it out now Wi on
[1:43:56] it and gather that seed the Bible says
[1:43:58] she has an epha of barley barley
[1:44:01] resurrection power brother Aaron it's
[1:44:03] five and a half gallons in our terms now
[1:44:07] that may not seem like a lot to you and
[1:44:08] I CU we go to Costco and buy a big old
[1:44:10] sack of flour you know or Sam's Club and
[1:44:12] Harley put it into the cart you know but
[1:44:15] but for this when she comes back around
[1:44:18] in verse 18 the Bible says she took it
[1:44:20] up went into the City and her
[1:44:22] mother-in-law
[1:44:23] saw what she had gleaned and she brought
[1:44:27] forth and gave to her she had reserved
[1:44:30] after she was suffice so notice she
[1:44:33] actually brought back from boaz's table
[1:44:36] there that meal what she haded it was
[1:44:40] like them little bear cubs that got in
[1:44:41] brother bram's
[1:44:44] molasses brother Bram said that mother
[1:44:46] one going to come over there but them
[1:44:47] youngans they got over there man they
[1:44:49] looked at all around and you know how
[1:44:51] the Bears get in there I don't know how
[1:44:52] it look look I my imagination just goes
[1:44:54] on me you know I'm thinking about him
[1:44:56] knocking over the tent and man just
[1:44:57] getting in that molasses bucket brother
[1:44:59] BR said they had it all over he said
[1:45:01] that one's little eyes was stuck I said
[1:45:03] oh God let the Molasses of the Holy
[1:45:06] Spirit to where if our eyes are seeing
[1:45:09] nothing but wrong let the anointing of
[1:45:11] the Holy Spirit come over our eyes that
[1:45:14] we can see nothing but God's grace God's
[1:45:16] mercy God's love for
[1:45:19] us got over there to the mama the mama
[1:45:21] wouldn't come but oh they got where mama
[1:45:23] was
[1:45:25] at she was cleaning them off that time
[1:45:27] boy but it wasn't to cleaning off chore
[1:45:29] like a mama washing Cubs she was draw
[1:45:32] away from what they had received they
[1:45:34] were shopping with
[1:45:38] molasses good and Ruth gives to
[1:45:44] Naomi notice this it's passing from a
[1:45:46] gentile to a
[1:45:49] Jew see the same holy ghost that we have
[1:45:52] receiv received
[1:45:54] will be passed to the Jews those two
[1:45:57] witnesses will preach the same baptism
[1:46:00] of the Holy Ghost they'll preach this
[1:46:02] same message of the
[1:46:04] hour it's
[1:46:06] Christ so here she
[1:46:08] sufficed now here's where I'm going to
[1:46:10] come to verse 19 and her mother-in-law
[1:46:13] said to her now watch this even Naomi
[1:46:14] Naomi didn't say man this is good this
[1:46:17] this barley cake man this is good wow
[1:46:20] this is good my Ruth look at that epha
[1:46:22] that that 5 and2 gallon my goodness man
[1:46:25] thank God oh my a this wonderful but
[1:46:28] Naomi being
[1:46:30] spiritual see Ruth is not aware of
[1:46:32] what's going on right but Naomi says in
[1:46:36] verse
[1:46:37] 19 where hast thou gleaned
[1:46:42] today because Naomi realizes you
[1:46:45] wouldn't have had this much if you would
[1:46:48] have been on the outer
[1:46:49] parts you wouldn't have had this much
[1:46:52] Where have you been you see what it was
[1:46:55] Naomi couldn't see it but what was done
[1:46:57] in secret amen was actually being showed
[1:47:01] openly her gleaning in secret this is
[1:47:04] why in Matthew 6 it says oh that you
[1:47:07] would hide away and pray oh sometimes
[1:47:09] it's friends it's taking the word it's
[1:47:11] praying over the word that's the purpose
[1:47:13] this is why the handful is a purpose to
[1:47:15] encourage us in our walk with
[1:47:20] God where R Us thou
[1:47:23] Blessed Be he that did take knowledge of
[1:47:28] thee somebody has taken knowledge of
[1:47:31] your Ruth you may not realize it but
[1:47:35] what you're carrying right now where
[1:47:37] have you been what message have you been
[1:47:41] sitting
[1:47:43] under and she showed her mother-in-law
[1:47:46] with whom she had wrought she said the
[1:47:48] man's name with whom I wrought today
[1:47:52] Hallelujah is
[1:47:53] Boaz that means nothing to Ruth right
[1:47:56] now but as soon as that name is
[1:48:00] mentioned remember Naomi comes out and
[1:48:03] Naomi says verse 20 Blessed Be he of the
[1:48:07] Lord W her tune has changed right in
[1:48:10] Ruth chapter 1 she said don't call me
[1:48:12] Naomi call me Mara but you see when you
[1:48:14] begin to see that handful of purpose you
[1:48:17] begin to see the presence of God moving
[1:48:19] down you begin to see God working in our
[1:48:21] midst there is a purpose for what God's
[1:48:24] doing now she says Blessed Be he of the
[1:48:28] Lord who hath left not his kindness to
[1:48:30] the living and to the dead and Naomi
[1:48:33] said to her the man is near kin unto us
[1:48:39] one of our next Kinsmen prise the Lord
[1:48:43] and Ruth said he said also to me Thou
[1:48:46] shalt keep fast by my young men until
[1:48:49] they have ended all my Harvest and Naomi
[1:48:52] said unto Ruth or Donald remember this
[1:48:54] is the Old Testament this is the
[1:48:56] laws of the
[1:48:58] Kinsmen it is good my daughter that thou
[1:49:01] go out with his maidens that they meet
[1:49:04] thee not in any other field so she kept
[1:49:07] fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean
[1:49:11] until the end of barley Harvest and of
[1:49:14] wheat Harvest and dwelt with her
[1:49:19] mother-in-law Naomi
[1:49:21] realizes this this is more than just
[1:49:24] about handfuls of
[1:49:26] purpose see right now there's a there
[1:49:29] there is a reality coming that's going
[1:49:31] to se that separates the seed from the
[1:49:35] Shu that it's not just about blessings
[1:49:38] it's not just about feelings but it's
[1:49:41] about
[1:49:43] Boaz all of this that has been received
[1:49:45] it's about Boaz and this with Boaz it's
[1:49:48] about you
[1:49:50] Ruth see the word is revealed feeling
[1:49:53] that per there's a purpose in what's
[1:49:55] being done this just hasn't happened let
[1:49:58] me just say it to you like this this
[1:50:00] word has not just come across your
[1:50:02] pathway but we are responsible for what
[1:50:05] we'll do with it we've got a choice
[1:50:08] friends we can take it and we can live
[1:50:11] and let this word transform our lives or
[1:50:14] we can just sit we can enjoy it go back
[1:50:17] out back to our homes back outside and
[1:50:19] we continue the same way we are or we
[1:50:22] can say Lord I want to take that
[1:50:26] purpose I want to give I want to
[1:50:28] surrender of my all Lord there's a
[1:50:32] reason why you've sent your word there's
[1:50:34] a reason why God sends an evangelist a
[1:50:36] teacher there's a reason why God sends
[1:50:39] his
[1:50:41] word it's so that that word might live
[1:50:44] might transform inside in our lives
[1:50:48] there's a purpose for it amen so I say
[1:50:51] thank God for every
[1:50:53] every good
[1:50:54] service but I'll say this if we're not
[1:50:57] being changed then what good is it doing
[1:51:01] us you've got to be able to ask that
[1:51:04] question what's the message doing in my
[1:51:07] life what am I am I giving myself I'm
[1:51:10] not talking about being able to quote
[1:51:11] quotes and and look and look the part
[1:51:13] friends I'm not I I think thank God for
[1:51:16] for Holiness and thing but I'm talking
[1:51:17] about a Holiness that comes from the
[1:51:20] inside cuz whatever is on the inside
[1:51:22] will come to the
[1:51:23] outside are you hearing me this is where
[1:51:25] we want to it's about Boaz it's about
[1:51:28] him he's the one who's in our midst he's
[1:51:30] the one that can do the work of the
[1:51:32] Kinsman he's the one that can bring us
[1:51:35] into our inheritance that's why the
[1:51:37] handfuls of purpose this is why God
[1:51:39] speaks to us in a personal way this is
[1:51:42] why God comes and he'll bring in another
[1:51:44] brother that maybe we've never met and
[1:51:46] God will bring that brother in and he'll
[1:51:47] Minister the word of God to us it was
[1:51:50] not just to make us feel good amen it's
[1:51:54] for reflection in our
[1:51:56] lives Lord I want to move on with you I
[1:51:59] want to surrender my all with you Lord
[1:52:02] God if there's things I need to confess
[1:52:05] and laying my life on the altar I want
[1:52:07] to do that
[1:52:08] Lord
[1:52:10] amen you see that's the difference that
[1:52:13] comes from the
[1:52:15] bride it's something that is realizing
[1:52:19] there's a purpose to
[1:52:20] this why am I here
[1:52:24] why did God put me here why did God send
[1:52:27] this message down my path I wasn't
[1:52:31] looking for for him he came looking for
[1:52:34] me there was a hunger for something
[1:52:37] beyond what what what you had in your
[1:52:39] life but you couldn't even explain it
[1:52:41] there it was it was a it was a drawing
[1:52:44] that was going on in your
[1:52:47] life but God had a
[1:52:49] purpose this message didn't come to you
[1:52:52] by accident that's right there was a
[1:52:55] purpose and God's desire is to achieve
[1:52:58] his purpose fully in your
[1:53:01] life amen let's
[1:53:05] pray Heavenly
[1:53:09] Father oh dear
[1:53:12] God how thankful we are Lord
[1:53:16] for the handfuls
[1:53:19] Lord of
[1:53:21] purpose Lord
[1:53:23] Lord to
[1:53:25] realize the
[1:53:27] encouragement the refreshing the
[1:53:30] renewing that comes our way
[1:53:33] Lord that father in everything that you
[1:53:36] do you do it with a
[1:53:40] purpose when Ruth Lord would get back to
[1:53:44] Naomi it was what Naomi could see that
[1:53:47] she returned with to
[1:53:50] know there's something somebody that's
[1:53:52] taking knowledge of you amen Lord right
[1:53:57] here I believe God is the same way you
[1:54:01] speaking Lord so personally to our
[1:54:04] lives calling to our hearts Lord wooing
[1:54:07] us Lord by your
[1:54:09] presence things that Lord that nobody
[1:54:12] would
[1:54:13] know things that Lord that has been on
[1:54:15] our hearts sometimes Lord things that
[1:54:17] we've prayed about other times Lord that
[1:54:19] handful of purpose will sweep right by
[1:54:22] in a healing of our
[1:54:24] body but Lord
[1:54:27] nonetheless in all these things it's you
[1:54:29] taking knowledge of
[1:54:32] us but Lord
[1:54:34] Jesus we just don't want to
[1:54:37] rejoice in the handfuls of
[1:54:40] purpose we don't want to be as it like
[1:54:42] the prophet said just blowing it out the
[1:54:44] Smoke
[1:54:45] Stack Lord we want it to be put to use
[1:54:48] in our lives it's an encouragement it's
[1:54:51] a strength it's it's kind of like Lord
[1:54:53] once in a while when a boss or somebody
[1:54:56] that will come by and I know that
[1:54:58] sometimes these are things are so rare
[1:54:59] but sometimes Lord you can have somebody
[1:55:01] come by and say hey I appreciate the job
[1:55:04] you're doing thank you for the those
[1:55:08] those details thank you for the things
[1:55:09] you're doing Lord it's something about
[1:55:12] that when just that little bit of an
[1:55:13] appreciation is showed it it just it
[1:55:17] helps us Lord I remember remember those
[1:55:19] things Lord how it helps us it
[1:55:21] encourages us Lord
[1:55:23] I think about it Lord even as a minister
[1:55:25] at times Lord I know brother Ivon others
[1:55:27] Lord that could say the same thing
[1:55:29] sometimes Lord when we're looking Lord
[1:55:31] at what we're ministering sometimes Lord
[1:55:32] it feels like it's been scrambled eggs
[1:55:35] but yet then Lord God how that father
[1:55:37] you it's been you that through it has
[1:55:40] touched the heart of somebody somebody's
[1:55:42] life has been touched has been affected
[1:55:44] Lord has been
[1:55:45] encouraged Lord Jesus this is what Lord
[1:55:49] God that you come to do is to encourage
[1:55:51] us in the word Lord you you don't come
[1:55:55] with your presence you don't sweep Lord
[1:55:58] among us Lord God that Lord that where
[1:56:00] we would become comfortable in just
[1:56:03] feeling the anointing just feeling the
[1:56:07] presence of God how thankful I Am Lord I
[1:56:10] I want to say this I am so thankful for
[1:56:13] your presence Among Us Lord I'm so
[1:56:16] thankful Lord God for the word of God
[1:56:18] moving Among Us Lord Lord I believe your
[1:56:21] desire Lord even as you would bring this
[1:56:24] about to our hearts like it was to Ruth
[1:56:27] you would help us to understand to make
[1:56:29] it Lord God where we reflect and realize
[1:56:33] you want to do
[1:56:34] more Lord you want to do more your
[1:56:37] presence has come to change us
[1:56:40] Lord to move Upon Our Lives to transform
[1:56:44] us
[1:56:45] Lord may we lord I pray God as your
[1:56:47] children like Ruth she had to reach down
[1:56:52] when she saw that handful of
[1:56:55] purpose and she had to pick it
[1:56:58] up she had to pick up every
[1:57:02] sheath sometimes the Lord he would go
[1:57:04] from one service and then it might be
[1:57:06] weeks or a month and then be another
[1:57:09] handful of purpose but she was gleaning
[1:57:11] she was gleaning the whole
[1:57:14] time like your Prophet said every once
[1:57:16] in a
[1:57:18] while you know Lord when and just to
[1:57:21] what measure you know just how to do it
[1:57:23] among
[1:57:24] us this is where our faith comes in
[1:57:28] Lord oh how I love to feel you Lord I
[1:57:31] love to feel your presence Lord when you
[1:57:34] come in in the times of
[1:57:37] prayer Lord God As you move Among Us oh
[1:57:40] I I just love to feel your
[1:57:43] presence but
[1:57:45] Lord as you teach
[1:57:48] us that even Lord when we don't feel
[1:57:51] your presence
[1:57:53] you're right there with us Lord It's Not
[1:57:57] Us imagining it it's not us just Lord
[1:58:00] God off the top of our head but we we
[1:58:02] have that Assurance for you said Lo I'm
[1:58:06] with thee
[1:58:07] always and we know Lord God that once we
[1:58:10] have been as we've been United with you
[1:58:12] we're not we're not separate these two
[1:58:14] shall be
[1:58:15] one we know Lord that even as the spirit
[1:58:18] of God would create a hunger and a
[1:58:20] thirst for righteousness the Bible said
[1:58:22] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[1:58:24] for righteousness for they shall be
[1:58:26] filled your Prophet would take that
[1:58:28] scripture and tell us that's a sign that
[1:58:30] the Holy Ghost is upon you not that you
[1:58:33] have it but it's upon you the holy
[1:58:35] spirit is creating and stirring up that
[1:58:37] hunger in your life he wants to be the
[1:58:42] satisfier of your
[1:58:44] life he wants to be your
[1:58:48] satisfying
[1:58:50] portion why don't you st why don't you
[1:58:53] come away from the edges of the fields
[1:58:55] you don't got to glean like a
[1:58:58] beggar you don't got the presence of the
[1:59:00] Lord is here to is here to woo you you
[1:59:03] don't have to remain a
[1:59:06] stranger come to the middle of God's
[1:59:08] field of Grace say
[1:59:11] Lord I take your mercy
[1:59:14] Lord I pour out Lord of my life my heart
[1:59:18] Lord God an open confession Lord
[1:59:24] oh Lord
[1:59:25] Jesus we weren't meant to walk around
[1:59:28] the
[1:59:29] corners we were meant to dwell with you
[1:59:33] [Music]
[1:59:35] Lord I want to say Lord as well thank
[1:59:37] you for your
[1:59:38] grace in this hour
[1:59:41] Lord Lord God I everybody else we'd all
[1:59:45] been like Lord been like anyone
[1:59:48] else we might have been looking at Lord
[1:59:51] certain things things Lord and gleanings
[1:59:53] in the field and events just like it's
[1:59:56] written in the scriptures like it was
[1:59:58] written of them when they came out of
[1:59:59] Egypt Lord but I'm so thankful for the
[2:00:02] understanding that God that you have
[2:00:04] breathed Upon Our Hearts to understand
[2:00:06] what the Miracles is all
[2:00:08] about that the Miracles that you've done
[2:00:11] is Lord you manifesting yourself that
[2:00:13] you're still here you're still the same
[2:00:15] God I think how your Prophet said when
[2:00:17] you would take Lord that of Divine
[2:00:19] Healing and it would be displayed before
[2:00:21] the people and shown that the same God
[2:00:23] that can take a case that is hopeless
[2:00:26] that same God can take a case
[2:00:28] spiritually that seems hopeless and
[2:00:30] transform that life so completely Lord
[2:00:33] God this is your purpose of coming Lord
[2:00:36] It's a purpose Lord of every handful you
[2:00:39] drop our
[2:00:42] way that even Lord as we would walk
[2:00:44] through the
[2:00:45] day we could be more even aware Even in
[2:00:49] our prayer life Lord guide me on the job
[2:00:52] today Lord Lord God I want to be

[2:01:24] make us known make known to us you've

[2:20:04] [Music]
[2:20:12] ever I tell you the way the Lord Jesus
[2:20:15] could say to the
[2:20:17] disciples blessed are your eyes that see
[2:20:20] amen and your ears that hear for many
[2:20:25] righteous men and Prophets have desired
[2:20:27] to hear the things that you have heard
[2:20:30] it was a time and an age of
[2:20:32] fulfillment and I tell you what a
[2:20:34] blessing it is to be able to see and
[2:20:38] recognize what God is doing in this hour
[2:20:41] yes sir that's right and to be able to
[2:20:43] see yourself in it that's right and see
[2:20:47] him in you absolutely yes sir this this
[2:20:50] message message come that Christ would
[2:20:54] live in
[2:20:57] flesh brother BR gives that simple
[2:20:59] example and mighty God unveiled before
[2:21:01] us remember the little boy the storm
[2:21:03] going on Mama I'm
[2:21:05] scared she said well we're Christians
[2:21:08] you know we're Christians God is with us
[2:21:10] he said but mama when it's storming like
[2:21:13] this yes I want god with skin on
[2:21:17] it and in these storms of lady
[2:21:22] oia when there's such an outpouring of
[2:21:24] demonic power all around
[2:21:26] us the lid has been taken off of hell
[2:21:30] and the prophet said streams of demon
[2:21:33] power yes I look at those words that he
[2:21:35] uses streaming yes
[2:21:39] streaming out of Hollywood streaming
[2:21:41] throughout all those things but just as
[2:21:44] much as all of hell has emptied out all
[2:21:49] of Heaven has come
[2:21:50] [Applause]
[2:21:55] down remember it's it's not by power not
[2:21:58] by might but by my spirit saith the Lord
[2:22:00] the whole key is US
[2:22:04] surrendering us getting out of the
[2:22:06] way that's what the word as it comes to
[2:22:09] do even when Naomi spoke to Ruth she's
[2:22:11] just letting Ruth know even in that
[2:22:13] moment hey this hasn't been by chance
[2:22:18] that you found these handfuls of purpose
[2:22:21] this isn't by chance that you found
[2:22:23] these
[2:22:25] sheep but
[2:22:27] Naomi let's her know somebody's taking
[2:22:30] knowledge of
[2:22:31] you Ruth said I don't know if it's some
[2:22:33] some guy by the name of Boaz it was a
[2:22:35] man that that's who that's what he said
[2:22:37] his name
[2:22:38] was but Naomi would have all of the
[2:22:41] concealed within there all the
[2:22:44] Redemptive names of Jehovah and all that
[2:22:47] it would mean amen aren't you grateful
[2:22:50] for God's grace friends God has he has
[2:22:53] everything that we have need of it's us
[2:22:56] taking it down into our own lives even
[2:22:58] as we leave out of here sometimes you
[2:23:01] don't see things right away in your life
[2:23:04] but sometimes that's where it's beating
[2:23:05] it
[2:23:06] out sometimes that's where it's beating
[2:23:08] it out our will and
[2:23:11] surrendering but you know what every
[2:23:13] word of God will come to pass in its
[2:23:17] season but we want to be found faithful
[2:23:20] is like that man who was at the pool of
[2:23:22] Bethesda I'm looking for God to fulfill
[2:23:26] his
[2:23:29] word amen you believe that
[2:23:34] amen uh Brother Ray has just a a quick
[2:23:36] testimony here before we're
[2:23:41] dismissed gray the gray go
[2:23:46] ahead hello okay yeah yeah um
[2:23:51] this happened a long time ago but I felt
[2:23:53] to just share it with you there was a
[2:23:56] young man I used to pick up from
[2:23:59] Cleveland bring them to the church
[2:24:02] services
[2:24:04] um it the Lord was dealing with him very
[2:24:07] much and um
[2:24:11] so there was uh things that he would see
[2:24:14] that was God showing them spiritually
[2:24:18] seeing things and and uh I started
[2:24:22] sharing with him about how God is still
[2:24:26] the same and he does Miracles so I
[2:24:30] started sharing with him about miracles
[2:24:33] well he one day he invited us my wife
[2:24:36] and I and my daughter um to to a
[2:24:42] picnic and uh and then he says I want to
[2:24:46] show you something Ray Brother Ray he
[2:24:48] says this this ball and it was so
[2:24:53] sentimental to him and everything that
[2:24:55] somebody gave to him and uh and he says
[2:24:59] you know I can throw this ball and he
[2:25:02] was showing me how high he could throw
[2:25:05] and he was showing it throwing it real
[2:25:07] high and um all of a sudden it went over
[2:25:11] the white at the
[2:25:14] Lighthouse and we went around the
[2:25:17] lighthouse and it wasn't there in the
[2:25:20] long on it was in the water and he says
[2:25:24] oh no you know he was real heartbroken
[2:25:27] he said that meant so much to me you
[2:25:31] know and just then I just felt to say
[2:25:35] you know in the Bible there was a man
[2:25:38] that borrowed an
[2:25:40] Axe and when he was using it the axe
[2:25:45] went into the water and he cried out to
[2:25:48] the prophet and says oh no
[2:25:51] you know I said just like you
[2:25:53] David and he says I said remember I told
[2:25:57] you all these Miracles and he said yeah
[2:26:00] I
[2:26:02] said that happened that was one of them
[2:26:07] and you know God can give you your ball
[2:26:09] back and he said you think so I said
[2:26:12] sure I says but you have to go get a
[2:26:16] stick because I explained to him about
[2:26:19] the stick
[2:26:21] and he got he went
[2:26:24] running by the pier looking up and down
[2:26:27] for it for a stick and he brought it I
[2:26:29] said remember it has to be a long one
[2:26:32] because we're way up here and it has to
[2:26:34] go all the way there there's a railing
[2:26:37] so he brought the
[2:26:40] stick and the ball was going way out way
[2:26:45] out way
[2:26:46] out
[2:26:48] and I said will put the stick in the
[2:26:52] water and the ball will come to
[2:26:56] it
[2:26:57] and kept on going out and out you know
[2:27:01] like trials you know but then the ball
[2:27:05] came right to the stick and it stayed
[2:27:08] with the
[2:27:10] stick and he says how we going to get it
[2:27:14] and I didn't know that there was a group
[2:27:16] of people way down there that was
[2:27:19] listening because because of my voice
[2:27:21] was carrying and it was going from North
[2:27:25] to the South and they were down
[2:27:28] there and they says we got a net we got
[2:27:32] a net you can borrow this net and take
[2:27:35] it and use it they were listening the
[2:27:38] whole time I didn't know it and and they
[2:27:42] were pretty
[2:27:43] far uh that's a miracle within itself
[2:27:48] and he scooped up the
[2:27:51] ball I just wanted to share that with
[2:28:00] you there's there's a lot of details
[2:28:03] that he left out yeah but it was very
[2:28:05] good there's things that I'm glad that
[2:28:09] God God brings things back to us
[2:28:11] sometimes there might be things you feel
[2:28:12] like that has escaped you even sometimes
[2:28:15] your
[2:28:17] joy but there's a way for that joy to
[2:28:19] return
[2:28:21] yes you know when putting the stick in
[2:28:23] the water that's representing bringing
[2:28:25] Christ into your situation right it's
[2:28:28] bringing our life submitting our life
[2:28:30] our heart our all and God knows how to
[2:28:32] bring things back
