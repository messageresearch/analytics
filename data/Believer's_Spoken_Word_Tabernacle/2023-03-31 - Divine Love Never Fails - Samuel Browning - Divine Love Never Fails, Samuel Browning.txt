desire Lord we desire more of you Lord less of us Lord oh God Lord what a reality it really really simple just to staying in your presence Lord there's just Lord there's nothing like your presence Lord because it's when we get into your presence that we really lose sight of ourselves Lord we see Lord like Moses as he stood there that day in the presence of that burning bush it was your presence Lord that where the bush itself was on fire but yet it was not consumed that everything every reason all of his human weaknesses were Lord exposed in that moment Lord it's in your presence like there with Moses that God had calls us to surrender it's causes us to see our littleness and the greatness of the need that we have Lord in you now Lord It's in recognizing your presence that the desires that are upon our hearts Lord that's what your presence sweeping by Lord it begins to stir up those desires Lord that has been placed on the inside and oh God when we can just recognize your presence and just let go Lord to what you are declaring oh God and how that you are moving Lord then whatever that we have need of and the desire that is in our life Lord you will take us to it Lord and father right here tonight Lord we invite you Lord Lord this this gathering tonight would be no more than that without your presence Lord we invite you tonight Lord that you would be so personal Lord that you would come Lord and minister in such a personal way to our lives Lord help us together to step out of the way that you can have the right of way that hearts and lives Lord would Lord just be moved deeper in you Lord there'd be a deeper surrender and consecration Lord from our hearts the Lord I pray may you come Lord and do only what you can do Lord no man can do this Lord no man can take us Lord across that line Lord between Time and Eternity no one Lord can do for us Lord what you can do Lord now father we ask that you would help us and give us the grace Lord that's needed in this moment to be able to step aside that you might be exalted Lord and that you might come on the scene Lord and that our faith would rise in you Lord God for lord it's in you that did his unlimited it is impossible Lord and you've only asked us if thou canst believe granted Lord tonight [Music] we love you and we thank you Father thank you Lord for ministering and meeting every need may we just Lord recognize your presence how sweet is your presence Lord Lord blessed be the name of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah amen we're just going to go right into the word and then I have some announcements after I let you be seated well read the scripture first and then I'll make some announcements here and so thankful amen good to see you Brother Carlos amen back at it and yeah and we want to remember brother Dave you put a request for your mom and dad you didn't oh boy I'm going to tell him no I was just uh texting with them here even today again and they are getting stronger they actually had been pretty sick and so I think some of it had been going around even before and so that's why they weren't there on Saturday and then even on Sunday and then here even tonight so we just want to keep them in prayer brother Dave and sister Shirley also I think was read here tonight for a sister Michelle and brother Bobby as well and they've just brother Bobby you know he has that explained that to you before has that real real battle with things and um and sister Michelle has just had some she just had one knee operated on in June and now the other knee the meniscus and everything is and you know just like when Satan he likes to try to pile things up on people and this is a time that we want to stand in and pray you know you take it personal you know you're you're picking on God's children you're picking on my brother my sister amen we just take him to the Lord in prayer and um so let's just read here in job 22 and um we'll read just the two scriptures we've been reading from this here quite some time and then we'll go right into some other scriptures but in job 22 and verse 2 remember this is one of the friends of of job that is asking a question and you know his the question is deals with the limited understanding and of the relationship that he would have with God and verse 2 he says can a man be profitable unto God as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself and I would say as we have been saying yes and no that God's desire is to use man not for man to use God and I I believe that that's God's desire is God God's whole purpose is to get a hold of us and work through us and not for us to take a hold and try to do it but let him do what he wants to do and that in itself is a paradox that's a paradox so may God bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to just make an announcement here that Lord willing this coming Sunday afternoon at 4 pm Now we move that back and the reason I had it at five before is because when my wife and they have to leave out of here real quick and to go make that communion bread so I mean and they were running it right to the wire when we had it at five so communion and foot washing and um if everything goes as is on Sunday morning I have some things on my heart that would kind of share around that and I want to just say we had I know my wife had posted it on Facebook or with regarding to Sister Connie Jenkins and her passing some of you may not know Sister Connie or remember Sister Connie Jenkins but sister Connie Jenkins was very much a part of this assembly here for many many years as a matter of fact she and the three granddaughters that she was Raising of her own they actually begin coming to the church when I was actually away playing ball there in college and before the Lord had got to hold my life and so there was a many that had known her from you know even in the past and uh and she was here sister Connie was one who was very very very faithful Among Us she was here like clockwork on midweek service and the and Sunday service she was one that if you didn't see her you knew something's wrong you know and that's kind of Christian you want to be you know you don't want to be where somebody where you're not missed and you would say well why would somebody not miss me well you know I know we can say well I stream but I don't see you streaming nobody else sees you streaming and I'm not saying that to probe any I'm just saying the realities of it is that sometimes you know if when when you're not here then you know we do miss you but if it's something you know like I said with sister Connie and I I think let me just go back and pull from the one I remember brother Cadre Diggs when he was here you know about seven years ago and he made a statement he said if if you're not here and people don't miss you he said then something's wrong with your experience is that right and it's true amen forgive me brother Cadre for using you but uh it's very true you know and I think about that my you know we we want to be very much a viable part you know and so sister Connie was that and so the Lord was gracious to us and we was there on Monday and Tuesday and just spoke the funeral there on Tuesday afternoon and just took a little thought on what is cherished the most and so you don't know what what all the Lord has done and um you know I spoke very plainly in the in the service as I believe we at the times of God gives Grace but I I told him I said hey I'm speaking plain but I know that's how she is Sister Connie spoke plain and I said but most of all I know he's happy about it uh because you know I believe there's a time that you know we have to have a reflection on our soul and uh and I believe that's a good thing to have that reflection and really see what do we really cherish the most you can you can cherish your job cherish your family but if you don't Cherish The Old Rugged Cross then you've missed the wrong thing and so that was her favorite song and the Lord just gave that inspiration there early in the morning on chair on that from that that refrain of that that that uh song on the word cherish and so we just spoke on that for a few moments and uh I I just um you know I just just asked that you just continue to pray for the family and different ones because they've been here at different times there was also a young lady that came up to us um afterwards that found me or afterwards wanted to know she said I'm new into the area and she said I'm looking for a church and she said I need to know where the church is at so you don't know what you don't know the only thing we know is we cast The Bread upon the water and if there's a seed that is there then you know it'll respond you know into that in into that life so we don't know and um but I also want to make an announcement here I don't want to prolong the time but there there is a need and I know that you no doubt you really don't know this couple or family but they do stream and they are located in in Cleveland in a in a place the sister was here one service and it's been at least has it been a year ago brother Richard a little bit less than a year and so she was here and she's from Congo as well and so she has um she's her and her and um brother chance they're over there and when Brother Richard and sister Maria just trying to reach out to her because they're not able to get here and um it just the circumstances that I can't go into Brother Richard could go into even more but they have it's very difficult she I don't know if she can drive or not I don't remember all the details but this is what it comes down to Brother Richard and sister Maria have still you know just going out because his sister Angeline just really to you know streaming into the services and them listening in so it reached out and just just wanting to just make contact with her and I really appreciate that and so uh they went and and they saw where they were living and they saw the need and and brother Richard you know he he he called me and I was actually in getting ready to go into a meeting there in Alabama and he had forgot all about it and I said hey that's no problem but I just assure you when Brother Richard called me he was just his heart and uh with seeing the situation where they absolutely had nothing um the only thing that they're covered up with is curtains that they had from the previous house and um it's a very very hard situation and they didn't ask for anything but when Brother Richard came away from there these are some of the needs and I know there's been things taken there already but it's just needs for some things this furniture and I I've made a copy of this that Brother Richard wrote down you can see him you can see sister Maria it's posted in each of the bathrooms now what has been wrote down in there's certain things a full or queen-sized bed dresser sofa couch small kitchen table with four chairs and this is it whether you know or you know someone because a lot of times we spread out and and I know sometimes you find things Facebook Marketplace or probably you have neighbors you know that do some things like that as well you know diapers and things like that see see um also for um some of the um for the children there's a one-year-old a two-year-old and there's one on the way is that correct so you see sister Maria for the sizes and you know if there's a crib or a mattress so you don't have to remember all this it's it's there on the bulletin board but um this is something right now that if we if if you know of someone because sometimes we always have family members or somebody that you know at work or whatever you know sometimes people ask and say hey I've got this is uh is there anything anybody want this or to get rid of it and and so just so you know and you can always say hey yeah well there's can you hold on to that and then we can get to it and get it over to them so is that okay so with just uh Brother Richard and sister Maria and you can you can see them and like I said it's posted there in the um in the restrooms and I really appreciate them looking in on that and um I want to just take a little thought here tonight and um I'm not really I know I won't get probably finished with it but I want to just continuing on that thought of a useful life but to be more punctual and more direct I want to just uh focus on this and that is divine Love Never Fails because we want to be useful a useful life and I want to just take that on how Divine love never fails in second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 14 Paul says For the Love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judged that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again and I want to just draw upon that out of the um in verse 14 and I want to just read it out of the Amplified version so I don't have to just completely define it but for the love of Christ constrainteth us and that it could constrain it means to control uh controls and urges and impels us so we are not being moved by our own love because that love will fail we can love God in our mind in our spirit and that only lasts so long but when the love of God has come down to that of the soul and it brings a real transformation then our lives are not regulated or lived out by reasoning but it becomes like a spring that's bubbling up and when that spring bubbles up that the spring itself like when brother Branham asked it what makes you Bubble Up is it the deer and all these other things is it because I come to drink from you it said no there is a force that's behind me that's pushing me and that's what the love of Christ moves within a life it controls us it urges us and it impels us so it moves us and I'm grateful that there is a force behind you and I and it's really it's the same force behind you and I if we can think about it the same love of God which is the Holy Ghost ghost which is the deity of almighty God inside of your eye that is the same one who stepped back in the beginning and said let there be so there is the creative power that resides in the heart of the believer and it is the love of God I need some more in these monitors please it's the love of God that resides within our heart that controls and urges and impels us now in Philippians chapter 2 verse 1 and I'm just moving to get to a place if there be any consolation now Paul is speaking to the body of Believers if there be any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind so Paul in verse 1 is saying if any of this is going to be this is the requirements oh that there would be a fulfillment of my joy now what Joy is Paul talking about Paul's not talking about his own Joy but he is talking about the joy of the Lord that has become a part of his life and the joy of the Lord is the strength of my life and that to be like-minded to be where we are in equal and so where our lives have been transformed and to have the same love being of one according to one mind that's the only way that these other parts in verse 1 can actually Operate Now notice in verse 3 let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory that actually deals with not putting oneself first but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus now brother Brandon I've been reading from this quote and I I because it's been a few weeks since we had dealt with this and I want to go back in to read this to lay a course here this evening brother Rambo says Jesus never lived for himself and I think that that speaks for itself in scripture he never had a Bentley his head on he said you know the foxes have dens but the son of man doesn't even have a place to lay his head to think about of everything he had many rights but he forsook all of those rights for you and I in order to redeem you and I now the reason and I want you let me just go ahead and read the rest of it Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others and that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't good you have an eternal life now you might think well that's that's um uh a contradictory you do good things and how could I be living my life to myself it depends on what's the motive that you're doing it for that's why Paul could say no I could speak in tongues though I could prophesy though I can know all the Mysteries though I give my good Goods to the poor though I sacrifice of my body if it is not there with Charity in my life it profiteth nothing right in other words it would be like you going and putting seemingly money in the account and the bank says there's not been any deposit are you hearing me so what is it that is to motivate govern and direct the Church of the Living God is the love of God because without God's love if you take God's love out of the equation we wouldn't even be here tonight it's the love of God that reached down for you and I that produce a savior for you and I It produced a blood cell that could pay the debt for our sins there's not enough Good Deeds that you and I could do we could never be good enough to ever pay the price God produced a blood cell amen that it might be a remitting of sin that that life in that blood cell God's own life could come back upon the worshiper could draw us back into a real Union with him eternal life is living for others it proved that when he come the Lamb of in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others and someone said now here's one of the ways we live for others someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names because you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man so the man the person that's calling you the names you could live for yourself you could sock his lights out in the name of Jesus I I you know I fled you to death but that's not living for that's you that's me right that's about me right because you can remember the Bible saying and all you do in word or deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ if you can't in the name of Jesus then don't pout preach brother Samuel if you can't give somebody the silent treatment in the name of Jesus then don't give them a silent treatment come on now you know all you do in word or deed now unless your Bible has your translation to it you know the new living beneath and below my privileges version you know how they got the nltv zv and whatever but I don't want them but I don't want to be a part of the new living beneath my privileges I want to live in the grace of God I I've Got Confidence that God's grace produces in our life what's needed what I can't do and what is absolutely against my human nature there is a divine nature to give me strength to subdue that you live for others that you might redeem that man how you become Sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons you're a son now the greatest way that you remember you're a son is not so much it's all together teaching it's it's him expressing what you and I are to be I'm telling you God has done that in this generation God is still continuing to do that listen this right here there's no greater expression of this even in our homes preach with me now there's no bread where do children learn to forgive not at school where did children will not at work and not Mom and Daddy going and hunting them down there I'm going to find out who the principal is in them and who this is because I am going to give them a piece of my mind be careful you might give away all your mind that's a direct quote from Brother John LaFontaine is that right though sometimes we you know that this is where things are expressed that's why it's example in God in this hour he didn't give us a picture of an eagle an eagle came flying over almighty God came over where you and I were at that's what got our attention not a good teaching of an eagle but it was the eagle himself Jehovah God yeah and the trouble of it is the church has forgotten they were Sons you're a son you're taking Christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others what brother Branham I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man we all can do that right sometimes what contributes let me ask you something what contributes sometimes to a nice man or a nice woman what is it oh well they never said anything bad to me never said no what it comes down to is is there's certain personalities I don't care how full of the Holy Ghost you are there are certain personalities you click with and there's other personalities you don't so what do I do don't try to change nobody's personality because God didn't hello somebody it ain't personality God ain't interested in changing people's personalities he made you the way he made you it only takes the Holy Ghost to come down on the inside that'll order that personality bring that life in subjection and will mold that character but God's got a purpose in it what should I do find you another good close buddy friend hello somebody man I know this is real simple but it's true right I mean it's just the truth live for that man who hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could but we probably need water bottles to swallow this one down tonight that's what they've done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things you give them up like sheep gives the wool now let me just say it in this way as we look at second II Thessalonians chapter 3. it's it is us becoming one with the sacrifice through the sacrificing of our will there's no other way for the Holy Ghost to come they're not sacrificing our will when the lamb said nevertheless not my will thine will be done there's no other way it has to be a sacrificing a surrendering to the will of God that's what Jacob that's what the wrestling was all about Jacob surrendering to the will of God that's what it was all about that's why God as he deals with the life it's God wanting to bring that life in surrender God will never and he never does overpower anybody God doesn't do that the Holy Spirit can overwhelm you the grace of God comes to you but it is not there to overpower you because in order for the new birth to take place there has to be a surrendering of our will sometimes that may take a long time with the wrestling out and it's not because somebody's more but you know in God's weaker sometimes we're just more hard-headed and stubborn than maybe something else and God let me tell you something you can't outrun God that's Hallelujah he said your names is written in the palm of my hand you can't outrun God God knows how to bring us to a place to where will is broken and we're willing to surrender hmm so it leads us once that has taken place it leads us to a sacrificial life which that's really what the whole Christian life is about is sacrifice and you know in order to think about it now we are called to be as Paul would write a Living Sacrifice and ongoing sacrifice that's where we need a lot of help in Jesus because there's times where we got to sacrifice our own will like who this needs to be said like that and oh man and then oh they said this to me or this but you've got to sacrifice your own will are you hearing me that's an ongoing thing to sacrifice our will to the will of almighty God now let me tell you something it isn't all together right here because you might keep everything locked in right here and it's bottled up right here and if it stays right here it'll send you to hell you can't have art and Grudge in your heart against nobody from the same year they wiped their feet on me you have no right are you hearing me preaching out I'm all the way through the Bible the Lord Jesus stood right there and when they had come at him they had beat him they had put the crown of thorns on his head and he stood there and said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing brother I believe that's a testimony of every son and daughter of God that's what the Holy Ghost produces in a life I tell you tonight if you never got to that place where you can forgive somebody and really get down in your heart and pray for it you need the love of God in your heart oh I know the message I ain't talking about the message I'm talking about the Holy Ghost you can know the message back and forth but if you don't got the love of God in your heart to get down when somebody has wronged you and prayed for them with a real sincerity you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost whoo my my a lot of freebies huh it's like getting in the Cracker Jack box and you've realized there's more than just two of those water soaked tattoos you got to be willing to sacrifice our will now watch this second Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 4. and Paul said we have confidence in the Lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command you now watch and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ now notice the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ so who is going to direct our hearts the Lord is that right now God has many Avenues God has his word right we can be reading here we are listening to the message right here is God comes right through his servants and the word can be spoken but it is God directing you and I leading you and I now watch this word direct I love this this word direct means to make straight to guide or direct and it deals with of the removal of the hindrances to coming to one so it's God removing leading us now notice it's not God removing the hindrances but it's God coming alongside of us and saying let's deal with this I love in the Song of Solomon song with Solomon Chapter 2 where he would talk about when it says let us take take us the foxes notice not take you but take us the foxes it's God coming exposing the little foxes and that's the time that God said come on let's take them on see it's not God just leaving you or not it's not us going out with our own will about trying to do something it's when God deals with our heart it's like a stream it's like a flow of the Holy Ghost when God is dealing with your heart get in the channel and move with it don't worry about if I can do this or I don't know if I'll be able to do this no get in the Stream Eagles themselves are patterned to find the source of that stream and that gust of air just just coming down Route Six on the way to church here and watch an eagle fly right right above you know our car and my goodness I just was trusting everyone a lot of traffic because I wanted to watch that fella but you see it you know they find they find that that they'll find those streams and I've watched them sometimes right over the house of where they'll come and you know and and they'll get right up then they'll start doing the circling and you find them where they find those streams and that's what you and I are meant to do we're meant to find those streams of God's grace that's where you and I were and you know an eagle don't have they're not up there when I watch them and then see them I've seen sometimes seen two of them and they're circling right around they're not flapping their wings at all they're simply sorry you see it's getting up there it's it's let taking the wings that God has given you and get away from the chatter of the devil chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter get on up into the heavenlies where there is streams of Grace that can do for you and move you from place to place now notice this in First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 31. Paul said but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet I show unto you a more excellent way now you realize you know the gifts themselves gifts and callings are without repentance they're there right it's just like every song leader a songwriter you know John Lennon and all them guys they'll give an account of the gift that late in their life of how they surrendered it how they surrender the gift in their life to influence others right now to think of this Paul was letting him know don't be Covetous of the gifts I want to show you something that is greater than all the gifts now Paul was not saying do away with the gifts it's like when brother Brown says that I believe in the Revelation series brother Brown tells us that the gifts themselves he had they been delivered to the church he said they have been put on the mantle like of the fireplace now he's not talking about decorations but it's like you know when my wife got the pots and pans you know from that a bridal shower she had to unpack them pots and pans they sat in a box for a few months you know uh in my bedroom there and waiting you know to for us to get married and and finally when we got into our place she unpacked them she put this pot here this pot here this pot here they were in the cabinet and when we needed the pot for spaghetti she didn't get out the saucer pan she got out what was needed to cook spaghetti when it was time for her and maybe boil some tea she didn't get out the big pot she got out the saucer pan or what was needed for gravy you say what are you saying I'm saying that when the gifts are in their place then God can use the spaghetti pot or prophecy or tongues into when he has need of it so in putting them on the mantle does not mean that they have been put away it's there and to be used as it's necessary so the use or non-use of the gift at a moment in a service does not dictate my victory in love divine right no more than I have to use a screwdriver every single day to feel Victorious I don't I'd appreciate if I don't have to use them much at all don't mind tools lock them in the toolbox notice yet Sean shots on it wait now notice I'm the show you so there is a a way that's being displayed now I'm Amplified I could read out of King James but like I said it'll just save me defining the words and allow me to move through this in First Corinthians 13 4 out of the amplifier love this is what charity does now this is not human love this is agape love right feel your love is what we would have for that of our wife right family but this agape love the Bible tells us God is love so when it talks about love right here this is it's talking about God in us love endures long and is patient and kind in other words love don't have a short fuse you don't like the firecrackers you get before you hardly throw them out of your hand boom they're gone no no love got a long fuse on it and I don't want to necessarily love God of fuse but you understand what I'm saying love constraineth less it controls us it urges us it impels us Hallelujah it keeps you from blowing potatoes over everybody like a pressure cooker love endures long and this patient and kind now that's that's some that's that's marvelous because you can suffer long right you can be like a dog that's ready to bite the next thing it comes along that ain't suffering long no no no no no that's saying don't get in my way because I might bite you even though I'm mad at so and so but the next person that crosses my pathway it's like they say in the woods when you're hunting deer if it's brown it's down laughs come on friends I know this is where the rubber meets a rope but it's true love endures long and is patient and kind love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy ooh that green-eyed monster of jealousy over the same I don't never get jealous you're lying you do sometimes you can get jealous even among family you can get jealous among church now what I'm trying to say is is that listen when God really doesn't work in your soul he don't change your flesh or parent but the God has come to direct us into the love of God right now there's a there's a key to all this here of living within that of Victory so notice it's not boastful or vainglorious you know it's it's not all about me right now I know you see these are things that's even character molding because sometimes what is called Fellowship ain't Fellowship is talk about me and you listenship right talk about my kids who cares about yours oh boy we're right down on the road now see that ain't that ain't that ain't what the love of God the love of God it's not about me look not every man on his own things you know life think about it our first birth and all of life is set up in that way our first birth is because of selfishness and pride is that right and we battle that you you battle that to the day that we are set free from here that thing of self we battle that and then to think even with the way that life itself and I'm talking about the way that things around us is so desired that even where a person that can see him and say well I don't want to be selfish but just sometimes with the cares of Life instead of us controlling the cares of life we allow them to control us you say I can't help it yes you can don't allow the devil to tell you that you can control it and not allow the situations to control you you're not living for this world you're living for God and victory comes by putting him first in everything my my mind it does not display itself heartily who my my you know like I'm somebody if you only had it like I had it if you only had the Revelation like we had it if that's the Revelation I don't want your revelation verse 5 it is not conceited which means to be arrogant and inflated with pride I'm sure we probably have never dealt with that or don't know anybody like that but this talk about us this is what love is not it is not rude unmannerly and does not act unbecomingly now I won't ask you to raise your hand but how many have had to repent don't don't raise your hands because but we've had to repent for our actions sometimes acting unbecomingly I'm gonna ask you who was that what was that that directed you and said Lord forgive me for the way I acted what was it it was the Lord directing your hearts into the love of God the love of God constrains us now notice love God's love in US does not insist on its own rights or its own way this right here the only thing I can think of is is like a picture of a temper tantrum in the floor except you know what that temper tantrum in the floor when it's young it changes when it gets older it just cuts everybody off you know why that's not been dealt with sometimes people's past let me let me say this to you now friends sometimes a past that's why it's very important for the Holy Spirit us to allow the Holy Spirit I'm talking about even his parents to allow him to comb through our lives in every way because we don't want to pass on hurts because the way that we've responded is from previous hurts we want to say Lord give me the grace that it stops right here that might have been how my family reacted but the character of Jesus Christ has displayed right now and I want to sacrifice my own will because I see the result of that oh my it's not about its own way you either do things my way or I'm quitting you do what I want or I I tell you what I ain't coming to church that is not the love of God and I'll tell you what you found one on boys standing right here I ain't bending to none of that that ain't just Samuel Browning but I am not because look this is important that love does not insist on its own rights its own way it's got to be the way of the word because the word has a true outcome is that right for it is not self-seeking oh it's not touchy we know what that means don't we or fretful or resentful or what's resentful what would be fretful or touchy resentful I mean you become resentful towards somebody that's not the love of God oh I've got the love of God that's a love no the love of God does not produce resent are you hearing me let me tell you how powerful resent is brother Brown would say it just like this he said when there is one in the congregation that is resenting the holy spirit will not reveal himself now you know you can just take it from me I know how that feels when maybe not just standing in front of a congregation but I know how it feels and sometimes I question myself sitting sometimes in counseling and I felt all alone they're one one scripture one quote coming to me and I felt all alone I really didn't know what it was at first that you know you think man why didn't you know you you later on this come this coming this but what it is it is even God's protection in that moment because if there's a resenting Spirit brother REM says he won't reveal himself and it's gone it's actually God's grace and mercy even on a person or persons that's God's mercy friends and I thank God for it right I'd rather it be withheld instead of something just come and be sad and it takes it the wrong way now notice it takes no account of the evil done to it it pays no attention to a suffered wrong what's that mean it means get it right rid of your file cabinet of everybody's wrongs yeah come on now like we said you know some some weeks ago you know and it was actually brother John Andy's at some point in time that I had heard him saying you know we've got to quit singing the song of somebody done somebody wrong song you know and going through it and John was just preaching I don't know if he said at a men's meeting or what but you know it's a thing to where you can become you can listen friends you can become so built up with offenses the Bible said offenses will come are you hearing me that's that's a scripture offenses are going to come but it depends on what we get built up with if you allow offenses to build up in your family if you allow fences to build up in your marriage if you allow it in the church remember it ain't the devil it ain't your brother it ain't your wife it ain't your husband nobody is there keeping records unless you choose to keep them hello all you always all I remember oh you always I've my Lord I thought I was going to get through this this is another thing love it does not rejoice at Injustice and unrighteousness but rejoices when right and Truth Prevail in other words if something's wrong I want to see the righteousness of God prevail if somebody's wrong I don't want to see well this needs to happen and that's wrong if something's wrong you want to see Lord that righteousness would Prevail truth would prevail that the lives would be helped and ministered to now notice love verse 7. Bears up under anything and everything that comes help me Lord is ever ready to believe the best of every person hello ever ready to believe the best of every person in other words I I want to believe and this is really where I stand I want to believe that you know what they didn't mean that didn't mean that no brother Sammy you don't know them you don't see even right there look at the spirit and look at the attitude are you hearing me friends I'm preaching right now I want to believe the best for every person this listen this is not quotes from a smiley face texting preaching in Texas that tells you you can name and claim a BMW after church this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ its hopes are faithless under all circumstances and it endures everything without weakening what does that love not our flesh and our spirit I'm not making excuse but I'm telling you our reasoning and in that realm it can never hold up it takes Divine love now let me just let me speak I know I've got just a few moments here left First Corinthians 13 8 charity this is where I'm drawing my my title from charity never faileth but where there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they'll cease whether there be knowledge it'll vanish away but charity will never fail now brother Branham is talking about and I want to just deal with this on of that of divine love we've read through much of the descriptive within that all of those things listen let me tell you this what we just read through here out of First Corinthians 13 the bulk and majority of that right there is under adversity are you hearing me I mean it would say Lord I want to manifest all the word of God that's part of the word of God you realize even when we look at the virtues in the stature of a perfect man these are not just things that oh you've got this now oh you've got this now oh you've got this now that's not at all what is being said the adding is not actually the word adding it's mean making more room for and the only way those things come out and it grows in our life is through adversity fruit is not produced on the Mountaintop fruit is produced in the valley Hallelujah so it's not just things being added to us in that manner but it is growth that takes place by the divine nature of God working in our lives so brother Brahm is speaking remember to and just these are some very common situations but he's speaking remember to the old blind gentleman that was there and came on the platform of Mexico and brother ramsini had no shoes didn't have a coat and he was blind and brother Bram talks about how that he took that man up to his bosom and Billy Graham said without even expecting a vision or anything like that God uh brother Brahm just begin to crowd and said God be merciful to this man be merciful to him begin his the heart began to be expressed for that man brother Ram didn't know that God was going to do anything for him he didn't know that the Man's eyes would be open but he saw the need what was his need he was blind he also had physical needs his shoes you know his coat jacket and and here's what happened God came down and healed that Man's eyes and here's this is what brother Ram says what was it Divine love projected and it resulted in Sovereign Grace taking its place this is I want you to listen to this statement Divine love can only go so far but when it is held true to the end Sovereign Grace takes its place and produces that which love could not carry out now think of that when it's held true to its end and he just said Divine love can only go so far it doesn't mean that love has a limit because Divine love that is God are you hearing me but when he's saying it has its limit in that through the whole longevity or the period or that time of the situation or the need it must remain constant held true to the end in other words let me just say it like this don't abort mission because it isn't happening quick enough love is patient right so if it's not well things aren't changing I was just pray for right here tonight and bless God I didn't see no different when I got home who told you it's going to be different when you got home did God tell you that come on Friends preach with me now you see what is that it's when Divine love is projected and it holds true it holds true throughout the longevity then Sovereign Grace steps in that's what allows Grace to step in I'll tell you we need Grace to step in there are situations after situations in our lives in the church your job that friends we can try to we our fingers bleed to try to turn something around God there's only one thing that's going to do it it'll take Grace to step in and Grace will never step in without Divine love So Divine love makes the way for Grace what is it it's god making a way for himself for what's needed for the healing to resolve division marriage family matters so forth it's got to be the right order when Divine love is projected think of it John 3 16 familiar scripture for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life notice God so loved the world now brother Adam said when Divine love is projected to its object God so loved the world the love was projected that way Sovereign Grace stepped in and produced what is projected I know this is really simple I pray that God allows it just to go down soul in our hearts and our lives because this is real victory this is real victory in our life when Divine love is projected to its object and let me just say this you can't project Divine love without Divine love right it has to be divine love those scriptures that I just read at First Corinthians 13. it's us giving ourselves to the will of God now I'm going to say this to you I I got more things that I could read of other quotes but I'm not around that's not where I'm going tonight but there's going to be times and there is times so let's put this in perspective that when you're looking at First Corinthians 13 you're going to have to pray and pray many times for situations God help me to have the right attitude help me to be patient I'm gonna tell you this right I just read is not autopilot it is US dying to ourselves and recognizing wait a minute here I need God to step in on the scene and it's going to be God stepping in by Divine love being projected now there's a few quotes here there's a brother and you've heard me refer to this numerous times there's a brother by the name of brother Krause now brother Krause was a good friend of brother Oral Roberts brother Branham all of them he came down with a bad kidney problem and his thought was because he loved me he supported all those Ministries and he loved them he said look he said I just you know what if I can just have a little time with brother Oral Roberts brother Oral Roberts prayed for him got a little bit better then it was right back then brother Branham he said well how do I need to go sit down with brother Brown she went and sat down with brother Brandon brother Brandon prayed brother Brown was praying for him and nothing lifted it was still there now it's a serious case and I if I can just paraphrase many of these points because it's in many messages but I like how brother the brand puts it together that this case that he was under was such a case that it was only a one in ten thousand chance survival if he went under the surgery and he believed that God you know they shall lay hands on the sick he believed that but as he was going in in every situation what it was is he had his love directed in the wrong place he had his love no it was the love of God but he had it directed toward brother Branham had it directed toward brother Roberts but when he got on that operating table his last words he said Lord I love you I love you and the testimony was is the doctors even in that moment were not even going to go ahead and perform the surgery but there was the glory of God came down in the operating room and it flooded that room to next thing he knew he wakes up and the doctors are even astounded at how the surgery went and then his recovery after that was way Beyond schedule brother Brown lets us know he said what it was he said his love had to be directed in the right way so it comes down to it that it's very key as brother Abraham says it regarding this that Divine love is projected in the right direction in other words it's going to have the right motives this is what he says in another place the alternatives are right behind it because if the motives aren't right then it's not the love of God but the Alternatives that's why brother Brandon says if you say I want God to heal me he said well why why do you want God to heal you there's none of her I've heard but now I see why do you want God to hear me so you can go on and live the same way or you've been living and he said if you want God to hear there's got to be a reason because Faith must find a true place to rest I don't want to be healed because I want to serve him better I want to serve him better I don't care if it's just a headache Lord Touch Me Lord so that my mind is free for today I believe that's I believe I believe I don't just believe I know there's the kind of God that we serve now think about it let me just say just say this here the love of God notice in the right direction so it's it's projected to the object and in the right direction it's where love is being projected to God it's where our love it's drawing us closer so in a test or a trout I'm talking about being a useful life it should be drawing us closer to God the love of God doesn't lead us further from him well brother Samuel I love him more than ever and go away from the word you can't that doesn't make sense right because it's the love of God that shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost that holds Us in those times it's a yearning it's a Desiring for more of him notice the scripture said he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him think about Ruth I have these scriptures but I don't have time to read them but probably perhaps no doubt many are familiar with that whole account Ruth forsook the land of her Nativity to go with her mother-in-law she loved Naomi and she said your God is going to be my God your people is going to be my people where you stay that's where I'm going to stay she made that decision then they get into the land and here she is in a field and she makes a request there among the Reapers and the chief Reaper who's in the field when the mighty Angel when Bo has descends the chief Reaper is able to tell Boaz this is who this is this is Ruth and this is what she's asked she's asked that she might be able to glean behind the handmaids not walk along next to him but if I can just walk behind them and pick up what's behind them will you let me do that and notice her humility it drew boy to where the very next verse is Boaz tells her abide in this field stay right here and I don't want you walking behind the maidens I want you to walk right with the maidens I want you to pick up what is there I want you to take and what did he say my daughter don't go to another field stay right here in this field see it's it's that place of staying right in God's presence charity never faileth Ruth never even had in her mind that she would end up in the position that she ended up in but charity never fails her conditions no it wasn't pleasurable conditions she didn't have everything delivered to her but charity never failed she continued in projecting the love of God and it held in that moment I just say it like this let me just read this in closing and I'll stop right here tonight when brother Brown talks about that bull and I want you to think about the word consecration for a moment but Brands talked about how he's seen that ball one he said here he come when he walked in the pastor you heard brother Berry describe it here on Sunday of what took place after brother Brown stepped across the fence and he broke down and just trembled and just crying because after the situation brother Brands described me and said here he come something happened I wish that would happen all the time it just don't do it but when I see a true real tremendous sick case and something happens it's not man it's when God can get a hold of man it's when it's consecrated I think that'd just be a good place to end tonight to be a useful life is to be a life that God can get a hold of at any moment brother Brown never planned on walking in front of a bull especially that bull he had heard about that bull that bull had just killed a man and they had sold it and he had forgot they put in that pasture and I'll tell you what remember what he told us he reached for his gun but he had left his gun in his truck seat and brother Brown said it very clear if he'd had the gun it had been a dead bull you with me so this isn't us walking around and you know walking around like well here's a mountain lion I'm gonna do this no brother brem didn't do that well I'm gonna let the love of God come down and I'm gonna no I'll tell you what I'm gonna do is reach for the gun if I've got one or run for a tree come on friends that was not brother Branham doing that and that's why I'm trying to end with tonight it wasn't brother Brown you know you hear it tell you know of other brothers they've been in other situations some have been in more extraneous situations and hunting and you know what they they were talking about this story and they said you know what I did and somewhere around in Africa I ran up the tree I didn't want to get you know have the horns come into me oh well brother Samuel where is the where is that of the love of God brother Branham even talked about the horns if he'd had the can of spray in his hand when they came out he just prayed him are you hearing me this isn't about man walking out let me show you love is not vainglorious brother Ram is letting us know he had no idea but what happened well brother Samuel what took place the love of God but here's the key because you and I are not going to know when situations and things arise but here's the key consecration like the song We sang before as I come out just to stay in his presence because listen in his prayer I'm not just talking about praying you and I both know I I you know thank you I don't want to go all the way into that but you know because people can pray and pray and be mean as a rattlesnake why is that they're not getting beyond the carpet that they're kneeling on did I talk about getting in his presence said listen that isn't just you know on our knees you can get in the prince of God sometimes it's just for us to just in prayer we're just meditating which sometimes are I just I just sit there as times where I've been in situations whether I've been out in a meeting sometimes it's been I just just going downstairs and one I just sat there and then his voice just starts flooding I'm not even saying a word it's just his presence is there we're just going that's prayer prayer isn't that I've got to be saying something prayer is where my heart is open for communion it's in his prayer you know what that is it's consecrating us it's tenderizing us it's making us available it's breaking down our will and prayer doesn't have to be a check-in and check out prayer without ceasing just just staying available to God just talking to him throughout the day I'm over my time here but I want to just say it's being consecrated it's not us it's not me it's not you flipping a switch and I hope that's a thing that I trust by the grace of God when we're looking at it love never fails it it is not it is not all love is patient bless God I've got to be patient and I'm going to know it's Lord I want to give myself to you and I I want to see more of you in me I don't even know what situations await me tonight I don't know what awaits me tomorrow morning I don't even know what awaits me next I don't know that but my heart's desire is this Lord mold me and make me I want his presence I want the dove not to fly away from me I want the dove to abide with me or abide with me abide in me I need him I need you every hour it may not be a bull we're walking in or Hornets or it may not be anything like that at all but I'll tell you just as much as that was unsuspecting in the prophet's life and unpredicted that's exactly how things come our way but I say Lord I'm not going to fret it what could possibly lay before me because he doesn't want us to do that but Lord let my life be so overtaken with the love of God I would just want to abide in his presence I listen to his word and put the message I just want to enjoy him just let my life be so saturated with him is that your desire because that love it'll never fail it'll never fail when it makes a way for Sovereign Grace to step in it did for our lives let's pray father Lord I just lowered it just want to say Lord how I love you we love you father oh God we are we're not making excuses but Lord we're not perfect people but Lord our Perfection is in you and it's our desire Lord oh Lord Jesus I want to be more like you Lord father when I read this there's not a time that I don't read that Lord in First Corinthians 13 over all the countless years there's not a time that I don't read it that Lord my heart and even in prayer and stopping and saying Lord grant it Lord in my life Lord I want more of you Lord we want more of you Lord Lord we certainly don't know the circumstances and things that Lord that could arise and I don't believe the love of God is just even about circumstances though those circumstances Lord require the love of God but Lord I believe that God that our lives it was intended Lord that we would walk every day by the love of God in the love of God help us Lord I pray God as a people May Lord is your presence Lord just God just sweeping down Lord among us Lord May Our Lives Lord as we give ourselves to you Lord I just and say Lord may you touch Lord every one of our hearts Lord if there's a heart that does not know that of the deepness of the love and of God lord of the sweetness Lord of your presence Lord of that love that God gives Lord a real peace and a satisfaction Lord that brings a real desire Lord and a real hunger in a reality of God in their life Lord grant it right here Lord even this evening Lord may it just Lord be a heart that is just set in motion Lord to seek after that reality Lord until Lord God that of the love of God Is So pulsates in their heart and their life and Lord It's the love of God that constrains us Lord it compels us it urges us it impels us lord it's you that's moving behind us and in US Lord and through us we just Lord want to continue to surrender ourselves to you we want to be available Lord we want to be available that God like the prophet said that where you can get a hold of a man Lord may we live in that way Lord I don't want the wrong feeling to take a hold of me I don't want the wrong attitude I don't want to be Lord where our lives are being fed on the wrong things and Lord we quickly go to the flesh no Lord we want to feed on the things of God we want to give ourselves Lord to the word that brings strength that brings the real nutrients in our life Lord granted Lord I pray we want to give ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen I think of that scripture we didn't get to it tonight but very familiar in the book of Jude keeping yourselves in the love of God I think that's I think that's true I believe it's true I want to keep myself there I want to keep myself there in the love of God I want to be just keeping myself before his presence because as I'm there before his presence I'm captured by his presence but it's it's his character it's his nature that not only is being revealed to me but it'll guide my actions it'll shape me it'll mold me see it's things that even what we're not even thinking about even consciously aware of but keeping ourselves in the love of God it's transforming us it's changing us from Glory unto Glory don't you love him tonight and let's stand if you'd like to and go ahead and lead us yes Lord that he should get his own [Music] courage courage his treasure how great the pain of searing oh my the falter to space away as wounds [Music] to Glory

from but it matters where you're running to you know sometimes there's things where you maybe on your job or whatever more sometimes you have to kind of do what you can to say you know I I need to have just a moment from this but it's who you make your Refuge that's what matters and we have a place like the Holy Spirit brought to us on Sunday night where we can let off the pressure 's are going to come all these things are going to come it comes I mean I don't know about you but I I read that and First Corinthians 13 and I realize those are not just things that manifest or come out of our lives without there being something that requires it to come out of our life remember all the Redemptive names of Jehovah that's who he is but it was situations needs that caused him to reveal himself in that way and see the way that God does is the same thing in in our moments brother Branham in each one of these situations that I referred to and I didn't get all the way through but he refers to every one of them and calls to calls them a crisis a crisis the bull the Hornets the maniac a crisis but when Divine Love Came Grace stepped in oh God that's that's what I want that's what I need I need more I need more but REM said it like this in one place he said Grace stepped in when I needed it when I needed it oh my I want to just so set myself to where my expectations is for Grace to step in that's what love that's what love will do aren't you grateful for the grace of God tonight aren't you glad he's still working on us I'm glad about that God his presence did not sweep down here tonight to condemn us he come to Lift Us higher I want to go higher Lord I want to go high remember the Lord shall direct your hearts into the love of God and the patient waiting of our Lord Jesus Christ remove all hindrances I'm glad I'm glad hallelujah amen God bless you tonight as you go amen be in prayer for the service here on Sunday shake hands with one another just a real blessing and a
