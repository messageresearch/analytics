calendar but things are coming up so quickly and I want to just uh remind you here this this week the midweek service we moved it to Tuesday this week and I sent that out to you and mentioned to you there before about that and I've just tried to do that in a way I just wanted to be with you in service Lord willing on Thursday in a morning a fly out a fly out for meetings in Mexico and just ask that you'd just keep keep me in prayer keep those meetings in prayer that God will just find his way in that service and then there and then we'll be back with you in the midweek and then the following weekend after that I have we have meetings in Indiana and there's some of the meetings that we have there Indiana those have been scheduled for my goodness six seven months um and this with Mexico just how this kind of fitting within this this time so usually you know I'm not I don't I'm not back to back within things like that I just don't I don't like doing things that way but that's just I don't have to just have to go according to the leading of the Lord and I know there's a good Ministry that will be here as well and I'll be here in the midweek will you will you and so I want to remind you next Sunday brother Ronnie long he he will be ministering here for us and brother Ronnie he was it's been a little bit over a year since he's been here but um I know that it will certainly be blessed uh Heaven brother Ronnie here um also the the uh the fire pit the fellowship that we were going to have out there this evening we just made the decision to go ahead and cancel that there's uh storms and all those chances and things like that that's coming here there and certainly would love to be able to get together but we do have it another one that's scheduled for September 18th and so that's a little ways from here but it'll be here before we know it and the other thing I wanted to to mention to you here uh this morning and just to prepare for it before the calendar comes out and that is the weekend before that September 11th my brother Trevor edman he's going to be here with us for two services on that Sunday and the reason I have that set up in that way they have the regular Sunday morning service and then we're going to have a Sunday afternoon service for the young people I've contacted the different um the different assemblies around here and just feeling that burden on my heart for a few years now because there's a need for to have that so the Lord willing and when I say young people I know if I have you know I know if I made a statement hey there's going to be ribs for young people here I'm sure there'd be a lot of young people showing up so we want to you know this is the thing you know with with our young people I want to do everything I can not just for our young people but for everybody but the young people deserve a fresh chance for a Revival in their life I have Revival you have Revival I'm going to pull for them I'm going to plug for everything everything along the way Amen to be here to pray and to press on those meetings I I don't ever want to get to a place in my walk or my life to say I don't need no more of that I need more of God I need more of God and I know we feel that way we want to just be a help and you know if you're able to be here I want you to understand it's not just exclusively just for the young people but it will be centered in that way but I know how you know when I've said in youth meetings been Retreat or I've sat there when others are you know ministering with or I'm listening to I've always been benefited I've always been I I've many times I've filled a notepad or taken notes and inspiration and just just coming so God God speaks to us no matter what age we are and so I just want to encourage you in that that's you know just for us as an assembly and I've also invited the different churches that are that are around here uh for that um before we have prayer I'm going to ask in just a moment that you know children and parents and college students I'd like to have prayer with you we'd like to have prayer as an assembly before we going back to school I heard the prayer request this morning about sister Linda and just asking that you had just continue to remember her in prayer she's getting stronger day by day and you know she's been getting in and out of the house and walking around and she's just itching to get back here to church and so uh you know she thought for sure that you know she would have been back here already I remember the first day when they were supposed to uh let her out of the hospital she uh they let her out and they sent her to the rehab and you know and just all that and and then they you know let her know hey you're not going to be able to do this man she was disappointed but about that time you know we were talking on the phone I said hey none of this has taken God by surprise right none of it has taken God there's little kinks along the way but we have a sure promise you know we may not know all this but we know God is in control so we want to continue to remember her in prayer and I know you are also um remember continue remember uh brother and sister Monica kobias in prayer that the Lord will just continue to touch and to to strengthen them I just need a real a real touch from the Lord so just ask you to just continue to keep those needs in prayer and other needs here in the assembly let's let's pray for one another amen as one another comes to our hearts says we're a body amen and so at this time I just would like to ask the the parents and children college students and just to come and we want to have prayer and you know we certainly believe in the protection of the Holy Spirit you know when when I was going to college one thing I asked I said God if you just I'm trusting you just to help me to get what I need to get just to be able to get that you know in any way we want his protection and I want you to know as as young people and as that you know when you walk into that school and you walk into that classroom I want you to know that the Lord Jesus is right there with you every day when you you walk in there and maybe you know you don't go to school maybe your home homeschooled or wherever I I what I encourage you to always invite the Lord Jesus you know you just um it'd be like you know me us just standing around and sometimes you stood around and maybe there's food on the table but nobody's invited you to take some you know it's but that that's something we realized that I didn't even you know sometimes it just slips our mind that I am every day just ask him to say Lord go with me today Lord be with me today on this test guide me Lord and direct me help me Lord give me the understanding that I need and protect me Lord give me strength amen and parents what a consolation it has that he's watching over when they when they come out when they go beyond your grasp and every he's watching over he never Slumbers nor sleeps he's watching over him and I believe we've got a banner the scripture said that he would be a wall of fire around us and I believe we can apply that promise in our lives amen let's just pray together could we pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are standing here Lord in this moment we realize the Lord that though all around us Lord we see the evil and we see the wickedness but father we're looking to you o God that Lord you are our protection you are our Shield you are buckler oh God and Lord for every one of these young people Lord as they Lord move in Lord there are skills there are things that Lord that they will need in life Lord things that Lord because you've got plans for him Lord and we ask that God that you would Lord keep your hand upon them Lord guide them Lord and keep them Lord from the evil Lord that is out there oh God May their lives be influenced the Lord by your spirit Lord May every day Lord they remember Lord just to invite you and say Lord Jesus go with me into the school today go with me Lord be right here today as I'm watching this class I'm looking at it Lord be with me and give me understanding Lord I pray that God that you'll just Lord just Comfort the hearts of the parents Lord and and giving them the wisdom Lord with things that Lord that maybe would arise but may you Lord our Mighty God and Lord the counselor Lord may you just sit down lord and move for every need lord lord it's not hard for us to ask this because that's what you promised Lord but we're asking God for your mercy Lord may you bless the Lord these days in this year Lord I pray and direct them every step of the way Lord we pray watch over them Lord God in every part of their life Lord physically Lord mentally Lord spiritually o God we ask the Lord for the protection of the Angel of the Lord upon their lives oh God we ask you the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God Amen amen God bless you amen God bless you amen sister Michelle God bless you amen welcome back God bless you I like that time buddy amen amen it's so wonderful to serve the Lord isn't it amen if we could uh let's uh if we could let's stand and we want to go right to the word of the Lord also one other thing I want to ask you to those of you because I don't know who all has registered for the men's meeting there's quite a number of you but if you could get in contact with brother Drake um so we know how to set up different arrangements and things like that for for travel and what we're going to do so if you have registered and signed up get in contact with brother Drake and we'll just kind of we'll go from there that so Psalms 23 verse 1. and I know brother Brian he I know that that that's okay that's all right it's if you don't have your Bible I guess you have your phone Psalm of David in Psalms 23 1 the Lord is my shepherd amen I shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters and he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his namesake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepare us a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anoint us my head with oil and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen may God bless you as you're being seated I want to read this this quote to you out of Satan's Eden and I want to just draw your attention to there in Psalms 23. and perhaps you've noticed that and you've seen that already but in every one of those of scriptures I want you to notice that David is expressing the Lord is my shepherd that God is a personal God there is no other God besides him he's a living being he's not a thought he's a person he's not an idea he's a person and that is something that's so real of the relationship that God has desired and has set forth for our lives and here out of the message Satan's Eden brother Branham would say it in this manner and he would say I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why I didn't preach on the Holy Ghost why I didn't do this now this quote I referred me quote it to you many times but I've always Marvel that found that someone could charge brother Brown and was not preaching on the Holy Ghost but you realize God was setting the understanding of what the Holy Ghost really is so you had a blending in where things were at because the holy ghost coming in this time that bran would call into one place it's the our triumphal Capstone that's coming down upon Our Lives to recognize the Sons and Daughters of God that God has ordained that we would receive that life now he goes on to make this statement he says here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age I want you to catch what he said it's the person of Jesus Christ established in our hearts so it's not one who it's not coming and going but he's taken his rightful position and so he's established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age Lutheran says now watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstrations we we believe in all the demonstrations he said but watch him in action not so much in demonstration but in action what it does according to the word now in first Samuel chapter 13 in in verse 8 when we look here in the scriptures I want to just pull from this point and here in verse 8 and the Bible says in first Samuel 13 8 and and and and he tarried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed I'm sorry I know I'm so used to this I didn't even give you time to turn to it but let me let me just let me just speak about it here just for a moment go ahead and turn to first Samuel 13. and as you turn in there here is a situation that Samuel in the under when the time when when Saul was to be anointed that Samuel had told Saul that you're going to go before me to gilgal and I'm going to come there at seven days and we're going to offer burn offerings and sacrifices and Pete all peace offerings and and and and your seven days you're going to tarry until I come to you and then God will show you what to do at that time so there's things that God's going to continue to to open to you what net what he has for you the next step of the journey and so the Bible speaks to us here in first Samuel 13 verse 8 and he carried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but Samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him and Saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered the burnt offering and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burn offering behold Samuel Cain and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and Samuel said what hast thou done and Saul said because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou came us not within the days appointed and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at mcmash therefore said I the Philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering now notice these next verses this is where I want to draw from and Samuel said to Saul thou Hast done foolishly thou Hast not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee now remember now God's spokesman was Samuel when Samuel had told him go ahead to gilgal and I'm going to be there in seven days this is where it was a need of discernment that this is not Samuel's thoughts or oops Samuel messed up here it was to recognize Samuel was Vindicated by God and what he said was not his own ideas so when we try to look at it or assault try to try to look at it through his own ideas he could start to look around and here we are at day seven but if God has spoken then God will fulfill his word that's certain God has never got impatient one time that's us we battle impatience even after the Holy Ghost has come that's a war of bringing our own lives subject to the word it's something we must do constantly when they went to go remember what Jesus told them go tarry in Jerusalem he let him know go wait now in this day and time where you and I are living we're not waiting on the Holy Ghost to be poured out he's here he's here but it is necessary to wait according to his word and know that what God has spoken through his Prophet which is not a different message but it calls us back to the original message back to the original outpouring of the Holy Ghost that we can have the same results and same assurance you might have been tearing for days maybe weeks or but you're not waste not waiting on God if the real waiting is is us coming to a place to say God let every part of my life be lined up with you and God gives Grace that our lives that here was the word is coming that our lives might be lined to his will I want you to think of this for thou thou Hast not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now with the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not camped that which the Lord commanded thee remember in the scriptures as it speaks of in the book of Isaiah then even how the young who are strong and full of Viber and vigor but even in this day they would faint because even their natural strength is not enough to withstand this forces of the enemy in this hour it's not enough it said they would faint but it says that they that will wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and shall Mount up with wings as an eagle if there's ever a time that that scripture would apply it applies in this hour this is the hour where God has granted wings of the Holy Spirit to back us back into the Homeland to back us back into the promises of God we can't get there on our own but God has supplied of his own self in this hour himself that would back us into the promises of God not my strength but his strength amen the very closing scripture in Psalms 27 which is the chapter of the Rapture wait on the Lord and He Shall strengthen thy heart be of good courage and he shall strengthen the heart let me tell you something anytime that you are waiting on the Lord let me tell you how you wait on him you wait on him with complete assurance that what he said he will do and as you're waiting there go ahead and start worshiping him and thanking him for what he's promised because heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail amen God don't ever have to take back one word that he ever said amen what he said he will fulfill in his own season it may not come according to my mind or my thinking or how that I but I do anything about that it's about what God God has said and let me be faithful in waiting and worshiping and confessing that God is in control and this is my promise we've reflected on some questions here over the past weeks who is your king aren't we you know are we under the headship of the word of God where where it's not we're not under the control of anybody else but it's the word of God that is moving and directing our life and and there's a you know there's the the submissiveness in our heart that when the word says anything there is and a man that ushers from our life and are we who is who is our leader where are we taking our cues from it's very important I I know these are reflective questions but this is what God had given that you and I would look at and I want you to think about it in this day that how did God told Saul it because Saul had disobeyed one commandment to wait upon God then God said at your kingdom will not be established in other words there is not going to be any continuation of your kingdom your kingdom itself I would have made it sure I would have established it I would have made made it strong that comes back to one thing you know when God when he moves into our life brother Brown says it like this in the Messiah and just give me just a few moments to kind of lay this in the background brother Brown said you know when a man gets saved a light comes into him the light comes into him is about like this little white button on my shirt so it'd be about like that comes in like a little white button and how that you and I are made up of a system of Tabernacles we are we are flesh you got five senses to your flesh right then we have Spirit there's five senses to our spirit conscience memory reason affection but then there's soul and the soul is the nature of the spirit the soul is what God comes to deal with right that's what God comes to deal with is deal with that life now within that there's only one way brother Brown would put it like this there's only one way for God to come into you and the Shekinah Glory to come into your life and that is it comes through self-will What What In Our Lives if you say well self-will that that's what's got in trouble along it's in trouble when it's not yielded to God because here in the Garden of Gethsemane remember the Lord Jesus he said nevertheless not my will thine will be done so it's always surrendering of our will but now how that God will come in and take over in the control tower of our life that's the only way brother Brown says is through that of self-will but he says when a man is born again with the spirit of God God Spirit dwells in him and he can let that Spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again then he will come right back to the same condition that he was in the Garden of Eden he goes on he says now that light or that eternal life is the light of God that dwells in the man and if he will yield to the spirit more he becomes unmanned sinner-like and becomes more Godlike can I repeat that if he will yield to the spirit more he becomes unmanned sinner-like and becomes more Godlike now the key here is yielding that that's the whole key in serving God is yielding to him it's not what you or I can do but it's yielding to his working that's part of the waiting it's yielding and it's looking to him and asking God this this should be something that that we can say in our lives over and over and daily Lord let my desires be lined up with your desires Lord let my ways be your ways my thoughts your thoughts let them be high Lord because they're higher they're greater than mine Lord Lift Me Up Lord let me operate in that channel and in that realm you know that's the promise let this mind be in you as it was in Christ Jesus that's the promise now notice in James chapter one will you turn with me there and James won some of these I do want you to read with me in James chapter 1 and verse 21 a familiar uh scripture passage here now notice in James chapter 1 and verse 21 and James is admonishing and speaking to this wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness now notice what James is speaking is not a mind over matter but the gospel every one of them remember uh Peter wrote he says that what that we have preached that gospel by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven and when the Holy Spirit comes and ministers the word it does not reveal to you that you are some trodden down person that oh I can't do anything but he lets you know that even the devil that's plaguing you or it's a sickness or whatever bondage God wants you to know you are a son and daughter of God in charge foreign let's put it right down where it belongs you don't become a son and daughter of God on a certain day you were always the Son and Daughter of God [Applause] Galatians 4 he hath sent forth his Spirit into our hearts why because we are Sons not because we were somebody special or my family or that it's the grace of almighty God that God sucked you and I out God brought us to himself and so James is letting you and I know if you can just take a hold of that this morning and say God let that drop down to the fifth rib that you have been put in charge and when the Holy Spirit is here speaking his word and he's energizing it and confirming it to your life can I say it in this way you can go ahead and step out on that word because you've got more than a preacher standing by your side you got more than a prophet standing by your side you've got almighty God that's letting you know what you are in charge and capable of doing you can tell that devil get out of here wherefore lay apart oh filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word that inborn that implanted word which is able to save your souls now with meekness you know the Bible said Moses was the meekest man of all the Earth yet we also know that quite a paradox because we also know that also it's got a little besetting sin there is that right did you see to be the meekest man in the earth what does meekness mean meekness Brothers say it mean to be simple and when you look at the word meek in the Scripture it means to give place to Moses simply when he came before The Burning Bush he gave place to God that's real meekness is not arguing with God but give place to the word just get placed to it you're saying you can look at you and I and look we're different in our personalities or make us but one thing you want to make sure is is that your personality your makeup is under the control of the Holy Spirit because if it's under the control of the Holy Spirit there is no more excuses well I am this way because of this or because of that you've got a greater Authority that has authorized you as the Son and Daughter of God to recognize the devil has no power over me [Applause] we might as well have church receive meekness receive it with meekness give place to it I'm going to say God I just want to give place to you I want to give place to the word I just want to give place to it it's not up to me to make it work he's the one that will work it out all I got to do is give place to it [Applause] [Music] because somebody wants to you know you know you're going to put maybe you know something new in your kitchen or you know a new instrument or one I don't need to know how to play it but just make room for it somebody will play it the word of God God will make sure it comes out in our life the right way verse 22 but be you doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves now think of that how a deception that is a deception that's not out here but it's a deception Within because being a hero of it but not a doer for If any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetth what manner of man he was now what that word straightway forget is he just just as quick as it comes it's gone it just the Bible is just being just you know it's like it's not important anything that's important we'll put it down on a reminder right sometimes there have been a lot of things I forgot that's important and I forgot to put it down on a reminder sure everybody else has to right sometimes we can look at things how in the world you forget this forget that I don't know it's but anyhow any thing when it comes down to it when God has spoken we want to be attentive and give place to that word in our life not being a forgetful not being a forgetful hearer just caring not even caring about but we want to give care to that word you say what kind of care you want to should we give to that word well as a child of Abraham when the word came to Abraham Abraham said go make a calf ready Sarah make some make some good old cornbread not the yellow stuff get the white buttermilk kind make that for him get some buttermilk out here too he'll get to dip it in get that out here and because what is it going to do we're going to entertain almighty God you say entertain him it's not just here God has not come to entertain us he doesn't come to entertain you he comes that we might entertain him and you know what happens if you don't entertain him he'll go on he'll go on but whosoever looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed now brother Brown would say it like this and spoken words original CDs he's speaking of of of of of of of the coming of the Holy Spirit and he says now you could say brother Brahm I believe every word of it he said but don't you back up when you get to your tradition you stay right with the word and stay with that and watch what happens oh Lord I believe it now notice what he says he said say it this oh Lord I believe it send the Holy Spirit then watch then if he goes to bearing record then you know you got it not by some sensation the Devils do that not by some miracle the Devils do that but by your constant belief in the word of God and the life that you live never deny nothing that makes the word notice that makes the word becoming flesh flesh in you now Saul we read here Saul had an opportunity to be established by God and you know the is to be established by God it comes by buying through obedience to the word of God that we are established and recognized as a Believer you see when God has said something in his word that he will establish something what God is letting it be known that I will make that sure I will make it positive I I will make it a positive reality to you now think of this in the scripture you can read of this you know of the how the Bible would record of how that God has created the heavens and he formed the Earth and made it and he established it in Jeremiah 51 15 said he hath made the Earth by his power he hath established the World by his wisdom and has stretched out the Heaven by his understanding so God has established every Star the Sun the moon God has established everything remember that was his first Bible and God has established it you know they give out voices they they they they they they they say the same thing you know they never said anything differently they still say the same thing so when God establishes anything it is something that is sure it is something that that is steadfast it is something that is absolutely unmovable if you or I try to make something we can make something as sure as we think we can make it they did that to the tomb of where the Lord Jesus was buried they made it as sure this is a scripture as they possibly could and as sure as man could make that God showed that there is nothing sure in man but the word of God is more sure than any word of a man all right and God loosened that hole that was upon that tomb so when God has said something he will stand behind it in the Bible when John Jehoshaphat one of the places in the scripture when Israel was going out to battle and here they were in front of the enemy here's a testimony of the of the Holy Spirit coming through in that hour believe in the Lord your God and so shall you be established believe His prophets so shall ye prosper now if you go with me to the Book of Romans and I want to just look in here just a moment and as you're turning there the Bible when you look at the establishment and how God would establish things the Bible said that all Israel knew from Dan to Beersheba that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord there was no question in that he was established not by man he was established by God you know he he was there and Eli was there but it wasn't Eli that established him Eli gave him good advice at first where Eli said and perceived it was God speaking to him as a little boy he had only 20 months he says is just when you hear his voice again just present yourself and say here I am oh my oh God help us to be little children in that way we want to be we want to be you know understanding but God help us to be children in that we steal can hear his voice and present ourselves before him and say Here I Am Lord you've called you've spoken Lord say on your servant is here Samuel was established to be a prophet of God now notice in Romans chapter 1 in verse 11 remember how Paul was wanting and Desiring to go to bed of Rome you see it was a burden of the Lord to take this gospel because God had made himself known to Paul and it was Paul according to God's working in his life that there was a desire that was not a man-made desire it was a desire of almighty God an achievement that God had before the foundation of the world there were hearts and lives to be reached by the gospel and Paul could say in verse 11 of Romans chapter 1 for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established now anyone talking about tongues we believe in tongues he wasn't talking about interpretation he's talking about the Unspeakable gift and that is the Holy Ghost I desired that I might impart some spiritual gift to you that you might be established because that is the only that is the true gift of almighty God that will establish you and I it sets us firm within the word of God because after all Paul's desire was is he said is that when I've come among you it's not with enticing words of man's Wisdom in other words I'm not calm among you that you would look to me for anything but I have come among you under the burden and desire of almighty God that your faith would stand and rest in the power of God what a burden to operate by now notice in Romans 16 if you want to turn over there just for a moment and I'll then after that I'll just refer to a few other places in the scripture but in Romans chapter 16 I I love this scripture the chapter before Paul has just set forth as a reminder of the authority that God has given to him as a minister to the Gentiles oh my notice in Romans 16 25 now to him that is of power to establish you oh glory be to God aren't you glad that there is the power not just a power but the power of the Living God that's able to establish you and I that which is able to make firm and to make sure we're we're not hoping we're not wondering but it makes sure it establishes us in Christ according to my gospel in the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the Revelation notice now according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began but now is made manifest so what was sealed up is now made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith to God only wives be glory through Jesus Christ forever now Paul would go on even in a few places I'd just referred to you don't have to turn there but he would speak to the the Ephesians and remember he would let him know of of the grace what has come to them you see he would let he would let him know in Ephesus you are you are called to be Saints now remember these people in Ephesus had received there you know there had there had been an outpouring of of the Holy Spirit there in Ephesus that had brought them in to the body of Jesus Christ now as Paul is standing there he's praying and he says I've been praying that God would strengthen you so there's evidently there's lives that needed to go on into establishment now just stay with me a minute and Paul was praying and asking and knowing that it is God that will strengthen you in your inner man that you might be rooted and grounded in faith I don't know about you you know when you uh you get ready to plant something and you you know your things that you you you get into and you plant many times you plant a tree a shrub or whatever more you know about the first year sometimes the first two years you've got to water that thing every every three you know every three days if you got hydrangeas you know hydraneous if they'll let you know you might try to wait three days but they'll let you know by their leaves you know them big beautiful bushes with the white flowers or whatever you call them or whatever more but you know the thing of it is they have to come into a place of get established you talk to any Nursery landscape or whatever more and they tell you they must get established now in order to get established there's got to be rain that would water them in well what's the whole purpose of that until they eventually tap in to the source of water that is beneath the ground that you or I can't see where they're not just waiting on a rain to come by but they've got tapped in and they are established no matter what storm comes no matter what comes their way they have now become rooted and established and built up yeah and this is where Paul has has said that my prayer is that the spirit of God would strengthen you in the inner man that you would be rooted and grounded in love second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 now he who establishes us with you in Christ and hath anointed us as God who also has sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts in Colossians 2 Verse 6 he says as ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him everybody say walk walk rooted now this is the way you walk rooted and built up in him so there is a strengthening of the holy spirit that comes into our life bringing us from death unto life that Roots us and grounds us in Christ and then through that rooting and grounding we are continually rooted and grounded you know your roots can't stop growing if your roots stop growing you're in trouble right Roots you say how do the roots grow roots are seeking for moisture roots are not thinking I'm gonna have to get out here to hold this plant in place the roots go to the water and by them going to the source of water it causes them to get a greater hold there within the Earth that when the storms come they're able to stand there oh Glory that's the same way it is with you and I this is why seeking after God and asking God let the roots go deeper let my walk go deeper let my life go deeper Lord let me have more of the Holy Ghost let me have every feeling of the Holy Ghost Lord what is it it's growing deeper glory be to God rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding abounding abounding therein with Thanksgiving and in the urgency of the moment we're living in in James 5 8. be also patient that means steadfast in waiting with an assurance an enduring Assurance be you also patient establish your hearts now notice what it says establish your hearts how do we establish our hearts that means we have access to that which is able to establish us Hallelujah to establish our hearts why because the coming of the Lord draweth nigh now let me just say it like this so as we were looking at that that statement where brother Barnabas looked at where the Holy Ghost is the person of Jesus Christ established in our heart quickening every word of this age to our life in other words making it alive to us and Us Alive to it so it's not just something we know is what we are yielded to and what God operates through us now let me tell you just as much as God's desire because Satan's a copycat right that's what he does he just copies the things that what God what God does and Satan's attempt intent is to establish himself the Bible makes that clear in second second Thessalonians chapter 2. and it speaks of the one that that false prophet that Beast even him who's coming is after Satan so notice Paul is saying that the way he's coming is after Satan so by the characteristics the way his approach is you're able to know that Satan let me preach where I'm on it do you realize that when Israel saw uh the king and this King it was a king of the children I believe the Iman I can't remember the name uh exactly but when they saw that King remember his name was nayash the king and they saw him when he came out his word his name nahash means servant and when they saw serpent King that put in their hearts we need a king and it was in that same verse of scripture that that serpent said I'm gonna put out your right eyes if you don't surrender little did Israel know that by giving heed to the serpent just looking upon Him by standing still for just a minute where did he fail when she stopped to listen when she stopped to listen remember brother random takes an example of a young lady who's been delivered she was a Dancehall Queen and she went over there and she come around there and she got around that dancehall and she said well yeah oh I remember me and Leah boy you know that that musical It really used to get me it don't bother me no more brother bam said aha you only think it don't she got over there around it and she started thinking let me tell you you know why she started thinking and calling back all those things where her and Lee that man they want all those different conferences or championships or dance dance offs you know why she got the thinking on it because she got under an atmosphere that started to deal with her painting I'm telling you you got to be careful where you go the things you entertain because there are atmospheres and spirits and remember every word is there is a spirit being carried with it she started reminiscing before long she was on the dance floor in the arms of a man all because have got this I've got this I don't think this is where atmosphere and influences take hold and remember it was a spirit brother random didn't just talk to her when she came there and knocked on his door remember what it was when he prayed there was a spirit that came out of her that was of a bat with long hairs remember the man who was drunk he sobered up real quick right what was it it was an evil spirit that she gave heed to listen to me are you telling us that we ought to be afraid but what I'm trying to tell you is is you know things that you should not be entangled with and Tangled Up with the Bible stands Stand Fast in the Liberty where with Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage sometimes I know we take the scriptures and I believe the quote that the bride is an invincible Army but I don't believe that it just makes us nonchalant well I don't have to worry about nothing I've got it on to control no when you meet him you realize he's what I need the Lord is my shepherd daily Moment by moment he knows where I need to be feeding he will direct me to Green Pastures and he will bring me by Still Waters to let me see myself in the reflection of the word and remind me of who I am and strengthen me so Satan's desire is to establish himself in the hearts and the way that he did this Brethren would pick this up in Satan's Eden in that same message and say the way that he did he came among those rabbis and Pharisees and different ones and he told them now the scripture that he's talking about of the promise and the Fulfillment of Isaiah 9 6 and on and on all those scriptures that was spoken Messiah Satan told those rabbis and Jews now that's absolutely the word it's absolutely the truth but this man ain't the man so he then couldn't tell them rabbis and Pharisees that it's not the word but what he told him was this ain't him but you see God always will identify himself by his same characteristics and if you'll notice how the Lord Jesus approached it the Lord Jesus is not a god of force Satan is the god of force God don't God hadn't forced himself on nobody God Don't Force you and I to believe God didn't force them no think of this after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus never said where is pilate that old unbeliever and the rest of them right now I'm gonna go prove to them exactly guess what it had done no good but who he raised for he came and found he didn't go back up there they didn't believe him the rabbis didn't believe him he didn't go up there and try to say now let me prove this to you this and that it was not approving time for them he was proving his word to whom I to his believing children and there were Believers that were gathered there in that hour of the resurrection and that word and events that they could not understand and little things they were seeing here or there but now when he comes and makes known that I am he that was dead and I'm Alive forevermore it stirs something up inside of them what is it it's the chief Shepherd that is coming to call his sheep foreign remember to establish himself and brother Brian would say it like this in that same line of thought he said you know you know Satan has worked you know to establish this deception through Ministry right the Bible says Satan has ministers right false workers they're not lazy people they work false apostles right ministers of light transforming themselves into Ministers of life this is more understanding let me tell you something any more understanding that don't require something out of your life ain't of God because every understanding that comes from God is going to require you and I to die to ourself that's why real Revelation is not head knowledge real Revelation is the impartation of the spirit of God it moves down into our life you can't even explain it brother said here you are under the preaching of the word and he said something begins to drop out of Eternity and it begins to come down and he said here it drops into your life and he said here where you were down you feel strong and where you were sad you feel happy he said your strength and why you have received a visitation from The Unseen realm I'm telling you God knows your address and he drops Revelation just as we have need of it Hallelujah and Satan's desire to try to establish himself that's why we stand I said we we stand against every opposing spirit we stand against every tradition if it's our own tradition if it's our own families thought about her her own Trinity we stand against everything that's against God [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah We're not gonna let the enemy establish or well I believe it this far we'll do this but we believe God and we know that God's desire is to so fully establish himself in our lives Hallelujah this is why the word must be established now think about this brother Brown would say it like this he said in the establishing of that word you got to take out all the unbelief and establish the kingdom of God in a man's heart now it's not just all the attributes of sin all those got to be gone right well we just read and lay apart all that and the unbelief you see what what allows and an attribute of sin to remain to remain as a threat of authority because of the unbelief that's there sometimes we're looking to the wrong Source instead of looking to he is the source of my life he is my delivery he is my savior he is my strength he is my conqueror I'm talking about him you are not being identified or introduced to an idea an idea can go home with you but the person of Jesus Christ will lead you he'll guide you he Shepherds your life yeah so all the beliefs got to be taken out so that the kingdom can be established in our heart oh my now think of it in this manner God through Paul would also let us know you've been chosen and upon this is the kind of Truth and Paul said but God from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth you didn't choose yourself God chose you let me tell you this way is new to you but God has chosen you to Walk This Way and his choosing is greater than your will because even before you fully surrender it's the choosing of God that's breaking over your life by the quickening power that's coming to lead you and guide you what is it it's God coming to fulfill his word as he said he would do it the Lord is my shepherd he called you by our gospel Paul said to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ now let me just throw down here just a moment but the RAM takes us in the adoption series now remember he's just come from Beyond the curtain of time and here he is he's preached rejected King he's dealing with this what has come to reign over the church world what is already there you know even the reality of Pentecost yeah I'm talking about Pentecostal organization not panic because real Pentecost is God that's simple Pentecost is God Hallelujah oh glory be to God now know that brother said like this he said God took you into the body of Christ after you proved yourself Sanctified yourself with your good behavior and obedience to the Holy Spirit no matter what the world says so see God takes you after there has been a sanctifying of your life whether that takes us in the future home it was sanctifying is even where you're thinking that has changed toward the things of the world there there is that you you do not you Lord I don't want to do those things that are wrong I don't want to do those things or please you see what is it it's more of the same holy ghost that has brought conviction upon your life to repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and more of the Holy Ghost has come to your life now remember he don't strip it out of you and I but he comes to present himself in revealing that I am your sanctifier and it's up to you and I to give place to the word in our life is that right now notice he said you've come into the body of Christ after you've Sanctified yourself with your good behavior and obedience to the Holy Spirit can I pause here just for a moment thank you I will but many times when we're looking at you know and even when a life can start out in serving God they've repented I trust you have because if you're not repented that's ground one well I come to church all my life that ain't repentance no more than a dog going to the same dog house he's always been in repentance is where you're convicted that I'm wrong [Music] I need the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior this is not a Reformation we're not trying to reform people that's not what the gospel is well I'm going to make you a better person got that not the gospel remember him who has the power to establish you the power to make your walk steadfast and and firm in him that same God comes and where's things that you can know in your life and you say I'm not going to do this let me say I'm not going to wear pants no more because that's not according to the word of God let me tell you something when you're praying and you're asking God Lord take that desire out of my life come on as it's coming take it out of my life God don't want you looking at something and saying well I have to do this and I have to do that it's God's word the Bible said that the women are to dress in modesty that means free flowing garments thank you well that ain't how this church teaches that I can't help how any other Church teaches it but there is one king that we have and that's the king of the Lord Jesus Christ and if he won't keep that word and stand on that word then how can we have taken away from his word man has done that under the inspiration of Satan doctrines of devils Satan don't care how religious you are as long as you don't get the life I know there's a lot more than just wearing pants and everything else but there's a lot more in the Holy Spirit brings us to that reminder and to those attentions of those things even within our life but notice I want you to hear about this but of them said you know he said what I'm going to rub it real hard he said but I don't mean to be rude but he said don't don't I don't want you to you're really going to think I'm mean but I don't want to be but he said what worries me is to take people and preach to them this God sent truth and they'll turn right back around and just keep on doing the same thing and say they got the Holy Ghost he said that just nearly ruins you that can't be friends you can't keep doing the same things and claim you've got the Holy Ghost the whole let me tell you something the Holy Ghost will never leave you bound when the Holy Ghost has come into your life I'm talking about with the baptism of the Holy Ghost where there's a change that comes on the inside of your life not just a sensation not just a feeling but the real person of Jesus Christ you now are under new ownership well brother Samuel I'm still bound the Holy Ghost brings liberation oh we're getting quiet now but he sets us free are you hearing me now and there can be traps but I think we need to be careful what we're calling a trap might actually be bondage but we have an answer I say we got an answer don't you ever let Satan diminish that answer that answer is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever is that all right because you see when God has come let's look at the scripture Romans 8 chapter uh Romans 8 chapter verse 10 if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he then raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you a brother random he he gives the example and we're talking and thinking about how God the power to establish us and that of God coming to establish and move in our life I believe with all my heart I believe you would agree with me God's desire is that every one of our lives would be established and we would continue to grow in him that's God's desire there is there you know let me just let me just bring this example brother Branham when he's he's looking at the quickening power of God which is the Holy Ghost and how that Paul had right here if if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal body in other words that life inside of you like we read the quote at the beginning his life inside of you it quickens you to the word in other words makes it alive it's not you or not me performing the word it's Christ operating through a love affair it doesn't mean that I'm well let me just get in this quote because I'll get to my punch line later here in a minute but you see brother bam says here's an Evidence of whether you have it or not talking about the Holy Ghost he said if that Spirit was in Christ is in you it'll Quicken you to the word now remember he quickens us to the word we can be around the word but not quickened to it right the disciples were around it they believed it right he proved hey what what Zechariah said this happened that the shepherd had been smitten and you were scattered all those things he began to prove to them the scriptures they were around it the whole time but now came time for their lives to be quickened because you know why they would not be able to make or to live out that testimony of Jesus Christ which is the spirit of Prophecy which is the identification of the Resurrection unless they were quickened by the same quickening power Hallelujah now think of it brother Graham said Jesus himself being a man he said he had to receive that quickening power in order to Quicken the promises unto him let me pick that up in a minute so it must be the quickening power that would come upon our life now brother look at this very close example he said if if the spirit that that comes upon you if it quickens you away from the word then it isn't the spirit of Christ now I want you to think of what he just said here because he says until that moves you in the word my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word of God you see when the quickening powers come now brother Ram talks about this example how many remember the dream he talks about that his mama had of the woman wearing high-heeled shoes and here was this you know his mama had the dream and brother said she wasn't much of a dreamer but here she had this dream of a woman wearing high-heeled shoes there's a lot within that I could preach on that after studying on those things like that because it's just incredible what what that all ties into of high heels and things like that but you know to look at this here here the woman she starts out and here's what she knows brother Brown said there were three steps that she had to come up and those three steps before she got into onto that pearly Highway that way that was there and he said now that's my message my message is justification sanctification by the blood and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said I was in the dream and he said I had spoke to that woman and I spoke to the rest of them and I said that you must come these three steps in order to walk that way now watch this watch the statement here and here this lady came by and when he spoke to her notice she was on her way and the Holy Spirit through the prophet caught her and said wait a minute sister you can't walk that Highway like that you can't do it thank God for that thank God for though let me tell you something the Holy Ghost is not here picking on you and trying to tear you down he's trying to take blinders off he's trying to shred veils because why he wants a relationship with you more than you desire it and he took all over and said hold on a minute you can't Walk This Way with them high-heeled shoes on and here's what she said she looked around at the rest of the women churches don't believe him he's a Madman don't believe him I'll show you I can be now listen to these statements I'll show you I can be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and still walk that now when brother Brandon's talking about being full of the Holy Ghost here he's not talking about where there's been a conversion on the soul but the brand tells us Demas was a Spirit-filled man does God change his mind he said Balaam was a Spirit-filled man but they weren't converted see the new birth is where there's a change on the inside not to where you're living under and anointing under a demonstration under an emotion but there's a life on the inside oh you hearing me now but you see where this woman she should have been what submissive to the word of God but instead she said I'm going to prove you wrong and brother Brown said now watch what brother Ram did I just let her go I couldn't do no more about it couldn't stop her you see God has not called us to try to arm wrestle and wrestle people and persuade people and this and that when Paul said I am you know trying to persuade you Paul was not trying to let me put a salesman's pitch on it what Paul was saying is I am yielding my life to Jesus Christ that he might come on the platform that he might speak the word because if there's any persuasion as far as breaking of hell it's got to be him but if he can't break the veil then there's then he can't be broken home and glory be to God if there's a veil to be broken and there's a pulsation in your heart that says Lord I want to know you then there is a veil to be broken there's a God to energize your life to break that Veil and this is what she did she jumped up on the highway and she looked at the other sisters the other churches see I told you brother Brandon gets us to the scripture of Isaiah 5 9 where they would want mincing feet and outstret outstretch your neck see that's in the scripture the high-heeled shoes now notice she started up that highway just as hard as she could run and after a while the road got narrower and narrower she started feeling and reeling and mincing like that and off she went now look look pretty good at first but eventually it got narrower the trials the tests it got narrower and because she wasn't established off she went you can look and say when she was walking on the highway but she didn't come the pathway that God had provided look brother Brown says see she obeyed just one word everything but just one word he said sure Pentecostal women can be saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and then fail and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God she failed she if she would have went on in all right but she failed to listen telling her what was ahead let me say it in this way you can see within that life she was telling the word what she was going to do and she was telling the word I don't need to do this remember what she said you're just a Madman you're overboard but brother Brown said eventually he said when she fell off and he said one of the most horriblest screams you ever heard you know why she was taking it for granted but there was a voice that came to her and let her know you're not going the right way and that's where the Holy Spirit he'll come and deal with our life we should never be ashamed to reflect in our own life friends you understand what I'm saying we're not looking at it today in your life and I'm asking you to question your experience but I am noticing that the Holy Spirit when he does come he will bring reflection in our life just don't take an emotion don't take a sensation don't even take an affiliation don't even take years that you've been around the message don't even take your knowledge don't take anything less been the full word of God the quickening power [Applause] let me just say it like this can I have a little bit more brother Ben said the Holy Ghost is a person let me go back to that quote I read in the beginning it's the action in you it's alive not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence but it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word for this age not just some of the words but he's there to Quicken every word make it alive to you and I that quickening power that lifts us from death unto life that same quickening power that comes forth that brought us out of the bar rooms wherever you were brother Graham said it was the quickening power that went out there and found you and began to speak to you that quickening power began to clean your life up and that same quickening power changed you and that same quickening power will raise you up one of these days David said it like this in Psalms 119 turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity and Quicken thou me in thy way establish Thy word unto thy servant which is devoted to thy fear turn away my reproach which I fear for the Judgment for thy judgments are good behold I have longed after thy precepts Quicken me in thy righteousness another scripture is all right Psalms 119 88 Quicken me after thy loving kindness so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou Hast established the Earth and it abideth they continue this day according to thine ordinances for all are thy servants I will never forget thy precepts for with them thou has quickened me David said in Psalms 40. he said I waited patiently for the Lord and He inclined unto me and heard My Cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit and out of the Maori clay and set my feet up on a rock and established my Goings what did this the quickening power of God you know God's desire was to get this quickening power to you and I David had experiences with the quickening power of God but he could not have what you and I are privileged to by the new birth are you hearing me none of the prophets were privileged because that had to come through the Redeemer the Redeemer anointing the Redeemer word it came to release that of redemption to bring back what rightfully belonged to him and in order to get the brother-in center like this in order to get this quickening power into you and I he had to become flesh he had to pay the price through the shedding of his blood that then that same life could come to you and I and what would it do it does not raise up our Natural Life he raises up that which he has sowed of himself into our life and he raises that life up right just like that of a baby that's in the womb that baby begins to grow after that conception it begins to do what multiply sell on top of cell on top of cell and it's growing in that womb mama mama nourishes it she takes care of it Daddy makes the midnight runs does whatever he needs to do in order to get the nourishment and what's needed and what's called for and what's he doing that because there is a life that is in that womb that is calling for that nourishment and that's the same way that it is in the life of of an individual where there is a nourishing to the life that's on the inside now let me tell you something Sports will never feed that life on the inside news will never feed that life on the inside come on somebody yeah you know uh you know I you know I I'm going to look at this and I'm going to relieve you you do not relieve or relax by by taking in things of the world and I thought we were smarter than that come on Friends well I'm just going to relax now you know we're not against relaxing hello don't go don't get clamped down on me now but we recognize that there are things that how there's got to be a nourishing and a nurturing of that life that is on the inside of us and remember the Holy Ghost if you have been born again now listen one of the key attributes it's not just what I don't smoke no more I don't drink no more I don't run around no more I don't look at this on the internet no more I don't do that it's no thank God there is a sanctifying but when the Holy Ghost has come it is a union with you and Jesus Christ if it's not a love affair then you've never been born again oh now can you get called yeah you can get cold and the Holy Spirit will correct you now you ain't gonna pound on me now are you you make it harder than the last bit I got to preach here then but it's a received from God and say Lord I want to know you more I want to know you more because when the quickening power has come it does not bring us into listen friends I'm afraid too many times that people have become in love with the church they've been become listen I thank God that people do want to come here are you hearing me this is not a this is not a church of the open diction dictator that is just dictating what you do and you do this and you do that I believe that it's the holy ghost that bursts people into the kingdom of God it's not a pastor it's not a man it's Jesus Christ I believe that with all my heart I know that to be the truth I'm witness to that thank God people do want to come around but you know what God knows who belongs to him God knows who belongs to him sometimes I wonder if we are too busy trying to cram down the word down people's throat to forget and say wait a minute here let's nurture those who are receiving it come on Friends it's not that we don't reach out to one another but you understand what I'm saying sometimes we get to focusing on the wrong things I never forget my brother when he had that whole thing of a had illiterate Rottweilers there at that time and he took him into the Vet you know there are them babies and they had they I mean just where the vet had to come actually when those when those pups were born and he got out there and with those pups and the way they were there was couple there that were actually just laying there there you know they hadn't hadn't been breathing and all that sense of birth and so forth and you know my brother got over there on him and the bet the vet was telling me when all this had happened said here I want you you need to be rubbing all these puppies because they'd come early you need to be rubbing and warming them up you need to be doing this right here and he was doing it he was doing it and then he was drawn to these two and he kept on rubbing these two he kept on rubbing these two he kept on rubbing these two eventually the vet came to him and said put them down focus on these these have already passed are you hearing me don't let the devil interpret anything to your mind what I am speaking to you clearly is let's focus on the things of almighty God is the one who takes the word and brings it into our hearts and our lives it's gone let me tell you something friends that's why we don't write nobody off but we need to focus on the things of almighty God there is I hope it's all right but Brian said it like this he said that Earnest of the quickening power is the potential that's there in your life the quickening power of your resurrection and he said you're on your way now by the quickening power you're on your way you're growing to a full Resurrection no tree just comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow in the grace and knowledge of God you are baptized into the Holy Spirit and he said we just keep growing we keep growing we keep going on and on and on and on the word keeps quickening and as you come to the first limb second limb third limb on up it keeps quickening and quickening and the spirit of God keeps quickening to you now think of this David would write over and over and over because of the quickening power of God and some of them I read to you there's more I could read to you and David would write about in the time of his afflictions David would say this three different times concerning his affliction that this is my comfort when I am Afflicted that Thy word has quickened me that's one place to draw your comfort from the word has quickened me Psalms 119 107 I am Afflicted very much Quicken Me O Lord according unto Thy word now notice he's comforted by the quickening that has come into his life and now through that quickening he's asking he's asking God Quicken me according to your word Psalms 119 and verse 53 he said consider my Affliction and deliver me for I do not forget thy law plead my cause and deliver me and Quicken me according to Thy Word I think of this David in each of those he's asking God to further Quicken him David is not in a place of saying Lord I've reached the summit but David said I know there is comfort that I draw from how you have quickened me according to your word I can draw Comfort now what Comfort does David draw that Lord you will Quicken me in mine affliction you will give me Deliverance in mine affliction you will strengthen me in mine affliction when's the last time we've asked God Quicken Me Lord Quicken me you can't find a message even after the seals and you start dealing with the word quickening it comes later on within them it's always through but brother Brown you'll hear him in the opening parts of the message quickness Lord Quicken more of the word to us quickness Lord what's he doing Lord make it alive to us make it more real to us Lord cause it to stand out more in our life that's what I pray I normally pray for my life I pray for the whole assembly God Quicken us more Quicken us more Lord Jesus Quicken us more let me just come back to something in case that's laying on somebody's mind we're not forgetting about anybody don't you let the devil get on I'm going to come back and address it because it keeps coming here you don't you let the devil beat you over that well brother Samuel don't care about this and but or so-and-so don't care no what I'm saying is is that sometimes we get to focusing on things instead of focusing on what God's doing are you hearing me in other words we got too many negative nancies around not enough positive peats are you hearing me I understand there's negative all around but why do I do you think I want a fellowship on negative I don't want a fellowship on negative I know there's problems all around but let me tell you something that's greater than every problem and it'll take care of every situation in this church and that's Jesus Christ he didn't say if the negative be lifted up he said if I be lifted up too many times we're giving ourself to the negative things come on we're not Balaam looking at the hinder parts [Applause] come on somebody we've got a mighty God in the camp I'm saying there's no situation I have watched God in the past years there is no situation that is wrote off in the presence of almighty God no situation God has turned lives around situations around he's brought lives back into to walk in the truth and give them a real experience there's nothing beyond God I tell you what we need to be praying is Lord Quicken us Lord Quicken us Lord Quicken us according to your word Quicken us a pire lord Quicken us a fire we're under a quickening message Hallelujah that makes the word alive that establishes us and we need to be exercising in our lives say Lord establish Me Lord let my life scriptures I could continue to read to you about God being faithful David Paul would say like this the Lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from all evil what's he doing putting our focus in him it's our focus in him just like we've been covering in the midweek service that Joshua did not know how that he was going to build walls were going to come down but what he needed was his what came and that was the Lord are you hearing me friends yeah that's I'm telling you he's here I'm trying to tell you there's somebody closer to you than your pastor I'm trying to tell you there's somebody who go with you I'm trying to tell you that there's somebody that when you talk to him if you just pour out your heart before him he will come he'll do for you what nobody else can do for you I'm only trying to point you to him he's the one that's here he's the one that's right Among Us he's the one that's changed your life he's the one that fills with the Holy Ghost he's the one that's been Healing The Sick he's the one that's been delivering we don't need to make anything happen all we need to do is wait with an assurance an assurance that God answers and fulfills every word and he'll establish you and he continues to establish you with every word as you're growing it's the quickening power of God at work in your life quickening quickening quickening quickening but you have to give place to the word say Lord make it alive to me make it real to me Lord in your prayer life Lord Quicken me like David all those in Psalms 119 you can go through them Quicken down me according to Thy Word praying and asking God Quicken me brother Brown said it like this on three kinds of Believers he said the same God that quickened me from Death unto life one of these mornings he said that quickening will come and pack me into the prince of God you see that we're under a quickening message that is not stopping it's quickening us on up that's why within our lives we step back and are waiting as God establishes our life establishing Us in the word it's God quickening us and realizing God has put it into our hands God's put it into your hands not mine but see when the word comes forth it stirs something up in US what is it it stirs something up maybe there's things that has got clouded up but he stirs that up in our life and like David you might be afflicted maybe you're Afflicted in your body Afflicted in your mind Afflicted in your spirit but you're Afflicted but you can say God quickened thou Me Lord and that's what that's what brings healing that's what brings difference that what's that's what brings everything of God to you and I personally is the quickening power of God they call it out there in the world they call it an aha moment in the classroom oh you can see your students go hahaha oh I got it let me tell you something the real aha moment is the quickening power of God and God's quickening that word quickening it clicking it that's how I want my prayer life to be how about you God let that be a part of regular verb vocabulary a lot Quicken that to me even while the words being preached and that word's coming forth quicker than that to me Lord Quicken it to me Lord Quicken me to hit Lord make it alive in my life Lord God if it comes my way and there's something that he says Samuel you've got this in the room I want to make room for it you know what I mean it's like your sister say oh we need this new design right here and your husband says where are we going to put it down on the wall where are they going to put it at right that means something's got to go you've got to make room for it we're the same God that's wanting to make a deposit he's also the same God that will give you the strength to make room for it he ain't wanting you to put it somewhere in a closet and save it for some garage sale you'll never have in your life he's wanting you to get rid of it the word wants to make room for its help it's that little white button on the inside it's crawling it's pushing out on the inside what's it happening there's a nurturing it's being fed on the word of God [Music] starts out that way but I believe it's bigger today and I'm going to keep feeding until it gets bigger you know you know how much I want to feed it I want to feed it to where it's pressing out eventually you can just start seeing in my life like a little baby on the inside when my mom when I'm not my mom when my wife was carrying our boys you know there's times when you know you could see the Kapow or the power I don't know which one it was foot or fish whatever it was but you could see it oh you feel that kick oh you feel that right there oh you feel that what was it it was a life on the inside identifying itself that I'm alive Oh Glory oh we had to start with at first was a little picture Glory Be Todd oh I know they say oh you got the little bump now you got the little Bob but all you started with was a picture and that picture you could see that little life on there but eventually that life that's in there through the nourishment and development it is growing on the nourishment you don't need a picture no more you feel it in your body you see it what is it it's become more visible say God establish me more and more Quicken thou me according to Thy Word Hallelujah let me tell you you've done nothing is impossible to God if you know I wouldn't be ashamed of my life if I didn't have the Holy Ghost if I could look at that in my life I would not be too ashamed to say Lord Quicken Me Lord let it be established not walk out not walk out and say well you know what I I can do this and I can do that and I've got the Holy Ghost you're only kidding yourself you're not fooling God and brother brand I'm liking that to Israel setting up their own King but oh there's a king here this morning let me tell you what this King will do we'll take from your family he'll give your family to you he won't take him and make Bakers out of them and servants out of them that's what the other the king will do but King Jesus will give you your family that's what King Jesus will do that's what he promised bam their offspring shall be there with them believe thine thy household shall be saved that's his word you say I don't see it yet what does that got to do with it he said it I believe it it is done I'm confessing it it's done how can you do that because it was Works were finished before the foundation of the world and just in case there was any question he came to fulfill what was already finished and he said it is finished [Music] The Finisher comes to finish he's here to Quicken this morning I'd like a good dose of quickening wouldn't you I'd like a good dose of quickening Lord quickened on me perhaps right now this morning What the Lord Has Done is to Quicken our hearts to realize you know what Lord I need more of you that's when I need to be asking I need to be asking God for more of him when tests and trials and whatever's going on in my life I need to realize one thing before those tests and Trials come every day I need to be asking God Quicken me Lord take me a little bit deeper you might be on your way to work you might be walking down through the nursing home you might I don't know wherever you work at or whatever you can be walking right down through the midst of Walmart Target or whatever more and it strikes your heart and you can just begin to say Lord Quicken Me Lord take me deeper Lord Jesus let me tell you something there is no boundaries with Jesus Christ he is with you to Quicken you I think we ought to so invite him in our life and that should be the prayer of Our Lives Quicken me Lord Quicken me Lord Quicken Me Lord foreign that life that started in here and has been developed until that day of release when this week life has been fully developed and one of these days when that wheat life has been fully developed that old Cocker Barrel shell will have to give away because the quickening power of God will move down and it wasn't you know how the quickening power is going to move down and call them out and call them out of the Grave is by its working in your life in my life is that right how did the dead know how to how did the dead know when to come out of the grave are you with me the Bible said when Jesus arose you said well the Bible said he led captivity captive but remember they knew it was time when the sounding and his arrival came and when he arose they arose with him it triggered them to come it now is that time where do you think it is it's going to trigger the resurrection it's the quickening power of God that's reigning in the hearts of the believer that one of these mornings between six and nine you'll be looking in the mirror and one of your loved ones standing behind you I'm looking for my daddy but it won't be for coffee that morning whoa ghost being a cop helpful glory be to God that quickening power they don't raise them up and that same quickening power that we've come to know we will look and We Know by their raising Our Moment has come and that
