that we can really serve him is when that deposit of his own love comes into our life amen then we can really love him amen the right way a love that my no matter what comes or goes it's an anchor in our lives it's something that no matter what what takes place no matter what mental battles no matter what situation there's an anchor that holds you and that's what Paul would speak of the love of God that we have through Christ Jesus our lord aren't you thankful for that love tonight amen it's an anchor that holds us it's beyond feelings it's beyond anything it's a reality that it just anchors in our heart and we we love him and you know what he's not a figment of our imagination he is the word amen he is the word he's the same yesterday today and forever and how thankful we are just to be Believers in this hour amen with God and His grace what he's done for us and what he's doing for us and we just so thank God for his mercy and I tell you tonight what an opportunity we have to be able to come into the house of God you know there's times that there's no doubt down through the scriptures there's different ones that they would have loved to had an opportunity and have that opportunity once again but you know in this sometimes in these moments we and have times in our natural Gatherings and we'll say man I wish we'd have done this oh man maybe the next time together we'll do this and man I forgot about this oh I forgot oh when you come back the next time but you know we're never promised even a next time within natural family gatherings Gatherings of friends but you know God knows this moment that we have even as as young people no matter what what our age is I want to say Lord let's take full advantage of the opport Unity that he's given us here tonight that he would come by our way and say Lord help me to just I want to draw from you what you see that I have need of tonight because you know God has come with a bag in store his medicine bag he knows just what we need and and so I believe God is going to take the gift in brother Trevor's life and move the man part to the side and speak to our lives I mean God's always on time he knows exactly what we have need of so let's just pull on the gift of God tonight God is mindful of every one of our needs and I'll just go ahead and say it like this we can go ahead and thank him right now for meeting all of our needs because he don't he don't have to go back to Calvary he don't have to raise again he's already done that he's done it all he's satisfied every debt he's satisfied for every need God let our eyes of Faith rise to that place to recognize it's already done it's already done don't you love him tonight amen Hallelujah so thankful that brother Trevor sister anim and Amen brother Azariah and brother Zion so glad to have them here and uh we just want to welcome brother Trevor he's such been such a blessing to us as a family as assembly and um we just want to pull in the gift of God I want to say we were not aware of how slick that was out there and then I found out from brother Trevor when I was in the office that even when he got back to his hotel parking lot it was completely uh ice over and that was before so um and there's really there's some things Brother Richard ran out to to get to take care of that uh so uh just be careful on your way out uh when you do leave so I guess we can say this nobody's going to be rushing out of here but you know let's just we'll just pray and you know just settling this way and say Lord will you know the needs that's out there even out there God's able to satisfy all those needs as too you believe that I believe that hey friends listen when when this church was getting started if God if God honored the request sister py when you were baking in a baking a cake and your oven didn't work but you laid hands on it and God seen to it that that that that oven baked a cake then I mean there's nothing too big for God God knows what we have need of amen and so let's just pull on the gift of God tonight brother Trevor come and take your Liberty tonight how many love brother Trevor amen amen oh falling in love with Jes oh falling falling in love oh with Jesus Falling In Love With Jesus best thing I've ever ever done falling in love with Jesus I'm Falling Falling In Love With Jesus Falling In Love With Jesus Oh the best thing I've ever ever done [Music] amen so thankful to have fallen in love with him and and U and maybe it causes me to come out on a really icy night and but I'm I'm just so in love with him that that it's okay certainly wish it would be it would be better out but um we're just thankful for the Lord and all that he does for us so just pray that everybody's is safe and and don't have any injuries or anything like that in the parking lots and so we're we're thankful that you came out and and braved the the icy conditions tonight thank you musicians appreciate it very much enjoyed the song service and the presence of the Lord amongst us already amen so you have my slides there Brothers if that's working I don't know I'm plugged into the HDMI there we that's nice nice wonderful so I'd like to take a title tonight of be strong and courageous so um before before having you stand and before we get to the scripture I just there's a quote that I it's too far back into my notes and I decided I really wanted to read it so I'm going to read this quote to you and then we can we can read the scripture just because I don't want to forget and I really want to read this quote so um from 55 uh 10:08 brother Bram says the results of decision we're no longer in Egypt we've done pulled up our tent stakes and left come through the Red Sea the blood of the Lord Jesus seing all the old habits and things of Life drowned the task Masters that drove us through the barrooms and cocktail lounges and so forth and seeing all that drown like pharaoh and his horses and then now we're in the wilderness moving along following the angel of the Covenant the Holy Spirit and knowing that we're on our road to a great land that'll be here and during the days of the Millennium and we're going for that thousand years of Millennium Reign it's a type of the Thousand Years Reign on the earth with Christ three stages of the journey and we're ready now the church is in my opinion in the spiritual stand to enter on the third scene and that's the scene we're going to tonight in our text we found out they needed a healing well now they had a doctor with them which was Moses and that's not the quote that I wanted to read this is the quote that was a good quote too and we'll get into that this is the quote that I wanted to read so okay forgive me we've got too many people today saying yeah this is definitely the one it's too hard we can't do it we can it's harvest time that's the reason they got this big bunch of grapes and brought it back for evidence I can see Caleb and Joshua with that on their shoulders marching down through there just singing The Jubilee s song sure they have evidence they could prove that it was a good land they brought it back and give all the children a grape if they just wanted one off the one cluster just look what a bunch of grapes they had now Joshua and Caleb when they heard all of these these people murmuring the people saying oh it can't be done it can't be done Caleb run out in the midst of the people and quiet them said yes it can be Joshua stood by him said certainly can be God's given it to us amen I like that yes sir what was it they were positionally born in Christ they had a knowledge of the word and the word become manifested so look at where they're positionally born they have a knowledge of the word and they just kind of hung out no and the word become manifested now did the word become manifested before they had a knowledge no these things go together right remember every one of those Israelites had had the word of God preached to them but it only taken effect upon Caleb and Joshua to realize what it was all about so we can preach uh you know through the scriptures backwards and forwards and Moses preached to them backwards and forwards but only two of them realized what it was all about only two of them not only had the knowledge but let that knowledge become manifested in their life and so we want to we want to kind of talk about how things can be taking effect in our lives so if you don't mind you can stand with me we'll we'll get into our scripture that we want to read tonight from The Book of Joshua chapter 1 and we'll read verses 5 through 8 and I just went through uh much of this at the youth camp in Belgium that we've just returned from and we had a wonderful time there and I felt this is just still on my heart and I some of some of these Concepts I think are are uh very important and very um timely to us in and where we are in our lives particularly the young people even though there's very few of them thank you for coming that's so nice um and uh so maybe I'll bring it up just a little bit to middle age I hope you realize that I'm I'm preaching to everyone so I'll preach at a young people style but that doesn't mean you older people that there's nothing for you so and you middle-aged people God bless you we're together and so okay Joshua 1: 5-8 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do all to do according to all the law which my servant which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withersoever thou goest now so was the law given to us so that you know we could life could just be lame and hard no he wants us to prosper okay so God just just go ahead and tell yourself God wants me to prosper now this isn't TD Jake's prosperity gospel here I'm preaching but but we serve a loving God who wants the best for you amen this book of the law shal not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success we just bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord I pray that you just bless the reading of this word Lord and and may it take effect in our lives may we be Joshua and Caleb in this day Lord where your word can come and be spoken to us and that we can read it that we can hear it Lord God and then we can recognize Lord our place in that and Lord how that word can manifest and be effectual and Powerful through our lives even in face of Giants and City walls and problem s and discouragements and all kinds of nervousness that the devil would love to throw at the people today but father with your word in our lives that we could adhere to and meditate upon it Lord we are given the strength Lord to overcome these things father may we recognize that it's for each and every one of us to stand in and and to to meditate in and and to be a part of a very active part of Lord bless this service now and speak to our hearts in Jesus name name amen amen you may be seated so our scripture opens and we we we have Joshua being told by God that it is now time for him to lead the people over into the promised land that which they've been waiting on and you know they they've come out of Egypt and and and so we've we've we've gone through 40 years now of wandering ing in the wilderness and now it's time to turn northward and it's time to go and start claiming what was given to them all along and so what a joyous time but but but God you know God tells Joshua you know be strong and very courageous you know and what should you know what should your first thought be anytime someone tells you like what's the first thing that becomes obvious to you when someone who knows more than you tells you be strong and courage you just immediately know it's a walk in the park there's no problems ahead right no God knows this this is good there's going to be a struggle ahead but you're more than able but but if you're but but be strong and courageous you see God God is respecting Joshua God is respecting his people when he tells them be strong be courageous what it what he's saying is is I I know you can if if you couldn't I wouldn't tell you to but when God comes along and just says I need you to be strong he can see the potential that's inside of you and he's trying to encourage you that that that potential could begin to rise up in your life that you could begin to walk forward in what he's called you on to to do so God is giving you know it's it's God respecting the the one in front of him by saying I know you can do this I know there's potential there so be strong and courageous and and get ready to go and and so there's something about strength you know that that that uh that we need in our lives you know and but but it but don't we want strength in our lives right like we who wants to be weak nobody nobody wants to be weak okay so so we want talk about being from Moses to Joshua to be strong and we begin to set the scene here of where what's happening where are they at well here they are they're in a Wilderness and and so you know if we if we can talk about it you know they've come out of Egypt and then they went into a Wilderness and then they want to go to a promised land and and that's our progression you know and and brother Brandon will tell us in many places and and definitely in the in the Third Exodus um and he will compare that Egypt is a type of denominations and and so but but and so from out of denominations and then into a Wilderness but then into the promised land which is the Holy Ghost and eventually on into the Millennium and you know living and reigning with Jesus Christ but here are these children of Israel now that here they are they're they're they've they've been delivered and they've come out of Egypt they've come out of denomination they've come out of this Egyptian Taskmaster and here you know and so what was the cry on their heart before you know leaving Egypt as the as the oppression begin to come on them you know what was the cry on their heart what was it they were they were saying Lord Deliver Us what is it what does Deliver Us Deliver Us from these taskmasters Lord Lord set us free right right and so he brings them out of out of bondage he brings them out of the out of Egypt and across the the Red Sea and here they are and and and and Pharaoh's taskmasters in the the Army is drowned behind them and they they sing songs of Victory on the banks of the Red Sea opposite Egypt and so what is so what has happened well they've been set free There's No Going Back the the Deliverance is assured there's no Army to ever take them and Captivate them from Egypt ever again they've been set free and what a time that is you know and they finished their joing and all the you know Miriam's song and Moses song and we have these in the scriptures and how wonderful it is you know and man can you imagine the next day you know it's like you wake up and it's like yeah we are free man it's kind of like summer vacation you know you finish school you know and you finish finals and then and what do you do the next day what do you do the next day that we all know what you do do the next day bro you sleep till 2 why because you're free because it's summertime and I can do whatever I want and you think about it and you man you wake up at 2 and then you you get up you know and then you just have a little dance party and you think pharaoh and you have a professor in mind I'm sure and you you know and you like you can't you have no hold on me and you just a little praise break and then you go and you get back into bed you know and why because you can because you're free and the next day guess what you don't set an alarm why cuz you're free man so good and then and so maybe you sleep till maybe just noon cuz you know two was let's be honest excessive yesterday and we all recognize that but we were free and so it was just on principle and so today maybe it's just noon because we're free and so and then and then it's just like you know you get up at noon and then you have your lunch and then it's like man what do we do now like I mean I'm free I can I can do whatever I want and so you go and maybe you play some video games or something like that you know good Christian ones and um and and you know and then you do that for a while and then you know maybe there's dinner and then and then you go to sleep and then like the next day and we're pretending you don't have a job but you know um you know and then there's the next day and you you know guess what the next day you get to do whatever you want and and and do you know what happens after a week of young people you know what do you do after a week of doing whatever you want the next you know like okay you had Sunday and so at least you know there was a little bit of structure you went to church you know and now you're on week two of absolute freedom and you get up Monday morning is and and it's like hey what are you going to do today and what is the response of every young person nothing or I don't know that's good you can do whatever you want what you going do I don't know what is there to do well there's a bajillion things you could do but I don't know but you're free to do whatever you want to do what are you going to do nothing Freedom deliverance from taskmasters deliverance from tyranny and yet here we go we're a week out we had the we sang the songs of of Victory and rejoicing and here here we are a weak into to freedom and we're like I don't know what to do with my life so so what happens when you you're delivered into complete and total freedom well you've entered the Wilderness where you you just you just wander you just what are you going to do I I I don't know I play some more video games but 100% at that game last [Music] week you just you just you're free this is what it looks like sometimes and I'll just do it one more time to make it super awkward so that you get like so it just really sinks in like wandering is lame right and so you know you just you do the wander and you just I don't know nothing it's a metaphor you're all there okay good and so yeah so so the Israelites they come out of Egypt but now they're so free right and there's there's nothing they have to do but but there's there's nothing you know there's there's got to be at some point in time there's got to be something before them that gives them direction of what is good to be going into that gives them purpose and gives them meaning and so God says yeah but the whole intent was always to get you into the promised land it was never it that's where you're truly free is in the promised land because though you're free from denomination though you're free from you know from from from all of the the bondage that you used to be in but now now you're sitting there wandering and it can't be said that you're bound but in the same token you're not Ser you're not truly free because you're bound by your own circumstances of now if I have to if I have to choose that's if I have to choose what do I choose well you see you become you become your own God you know that's so good and that can be cool I'm master of Me no one can tell me what to do okay what are you going to do I don't know man you are such a master of you good good job you see you see the problem is is that we we like that idea you know especially if our parents have been telling us to do a lot of things lately we like the idea of Master of me but then when I become master of me now I have to actually be Master it's not just not that anymore but now it's what is it now and so now I if I'm God for myself I I have to be God and there's just one problem with me having to be God well there's a couple of problems I mean you know number one I'm just not but that that's the you know the point right under that one a is I don't I don't know everything like he [Applause] does and I look in the mirror when I wake up at tennish in the morning and I go you're in charge buddy and then you think man who put that guy in charge that's a dumb idea cuz I know me and if you're honest you know you and you think the same thing when you're looking in the mirror and you allow you know your your masks of you know arrogance and pride and all of this to go away and you allow yourself to see down into your heart you recognize man whoever put me in charge was dumb they shouldn't have done that you know and that's a problem isn't it because then with all of this potential on the inside of you with zero Direction you're like I don't know what you going to do nothing here we here here here we are and so the the Israelites now here they are they're in this freedom but they're in this freedom to wander and they've got to they've got to recognize that there's got to be something because they don't have it inside of themselves to say you know what let's all get together and decide what would be really really good and let's go and do it you know because did you ever wonder they get to Kadesh barnea and they send out the 10 the the 12 Spies right and it's like well why you know Moses you lead us out of Egypt you lead across the Red Sea you bring us over to SI we just follow which what we do we're Israelites we just follow our Prophet amen praise God how spiritual glory to God we follow a prophet and then the prophet comes and brings you to Kadesh Baria and you follow him all the way to Kadesh barnea and then he's got this idea to send spies out to go and see what is this does this promised land is it everything that we've been told it is and and so the spies come back and they say well you know two of them say look I mean there's grapes as big as your head here you know this is pretty amazing let's go and then other people are like yeah but did you see the Giants that eat those grapes you know their grapes are as big as our heads but those giants just go that's that's a good gra and that's problematic for us because we're obviously not that big and they begin to bring an evil report and and Moses Moses Moses just just leaves it up to the people here you go here's the report that you've been given I've we brought you this far now what are you going to do with the promise that I've given you and Moses doesn't lead Moses just doesn't lead it's like hey people there's Jericho we already did this now let's go do this thing take his staff and go forward and people just follow but Moses doesn't do that he stops to give them a chance to to see if they can recognize and find their own place in the word of God so that the promise doesn't just stay outside of them that they go get to walk into but they become part of their promise that the qualities of the promised land become inside of them [Applause] themselves and you want that it sounds nice well Moses if you can just lead us into the promised land okay if we have to take swords that's fine but you just keep leading us that'd be good right and that sounds nice because then we don't have to think about it we don't have to you know we just there's no like and instead God's like Joshua hey you're going to have to be strong and we're like well that doesn't sound as good because this is how most of us want to how much do you weigh these days what how much do you weigh these days 16 oh I can do that totally okay yeah um so this is how most of us you can stand here this is how most of us just just just like this just like this yeah I know you don't need to Don't worry um this is how most of us are you nervous this is how most of us want truly want God to bring us to the promised land just thank you Lord just want to go to the promised land here we [Applause] go enjoy your grapes and the milk and honey you left because because you know somehow brother Trevor figured out what deep down on the inside of your own heart how on Earth did he do that well cuz that's cuz that's me that's what I want I mean Lord you know this looks hard how about you just as Ben would say impersonating me do the thing and get me into the Promised Land and there's just a problem though because Ben he's here and he's enjoying his milk and honey he's en enjoying the grapes and it's so wonderful but who is he say well he's a child of God in the promised land yeah but inside in his heart what does he what does he know about himself what does he think about himself inside of his own heart because he's been picked up thrown into a Promised Land he knows his identity he is an EXs slave eating grapes come on that's who he is by any objective standard he's just an ex-slave that God said you know what you you don't need to be a slave anymore because I'm God and I say so so I'm going to deliver you out then I'm going to pick you up take you across the Wilderness put you in a Promised Land here you go buddy enjoy your grapes pray why don't you praise the Lord doeses anybody want that experience does is that what you want your testimony to be God just let me be lazy just let me be weak let me not do anything to get myself to the promised land let can you just carry me oh God into the promised land now I I I I understand we look at the the footsteps you know picture and you know hey there was two sets of footprints and then there was one and God and that prayer and that's beautiful and I love that that's fine but some times we hang out on that prayer like that whole thing like way too hard and it's like God there was like we look back and say Lord there was never there was never two sets of footprints did I do anything he's like no no you were a child you were just a baby you never grew but I put you in the promised land and gave you grapes because of me and he is that good but honestly he's better but he's he's not just that good he's better than than that so good because Ben doesn't want to be a weak EXs slave eating grapes in the promised land uhuh who looks up at God and says God thank you so much it was so great of you but there's there's like this like there's this vast Gulf between us Lord we're supposed to be husband and wife but there's this vast Gulf between us cuz I'm just weak sauce and you are so Sovereign and you just picked me up and threw me here and I'm all I can just do is be thankful but I have no idea what it is to enjoy the characteristics of who you are on the inside of me Hallelujah that's right you can sit down thank you and none of us when we think about when we think about the end result none of us want that because because what God is telling Joshua he says I'm telling you to be strong but one of the like one of the things about becoming strong and go going through the trials is that is that the part of part of what you want in the promised land is to have strength in your own life you want to be someone who's strong in the promised land you don't want to have just gotten there because God was so so good to you no you want to get gotten there because God was better to you to strengthen you to develop you to to give you an identity of something other than I'm just an ex slave because that's all my identity was but God puts them he doesn't just take them from Egypt into Promised Land he puts them in a Wilderness so now they have a journey and in that Journey they begin to develop the characteristics that God himself has so when they walk and they gain strength and they gain the character that he wants them to have and they get over to the promised land they're no longer an EXs slave eating grapes but now they're a child of almighty God who has who has things in common with her husband where he is strong we have those same attributes that he has caused to be developed inside of us and this is a promise my friends this is what God wants for us not to just make it easy but to develop inside of us all that he is so that our fellowship in the promised land is [Applause] Rich so we want strength but so often we forget and we want oh carry me carry me over now God is gracious and in hard times he can there are times when when he knows he's he you know he doesn't put more on you than you can handle and if he puts those things on you he helps you handle that's good but he wants you to be strong he wants you to participate in this amen he wants to develop you amen okay so here we go we're we're coming out of Egypt and we're in the wilderness and coming through a promised land and we got to start developing these uh some of these uh some of these ideas here that we're going to be using throughout the sermon but who are we talking about here who has come out of Egypt and who is now in the Wilderness at this time where Joshua is being told to be strong and very courageous well there was a group that came out of Egypt with Moses they came to cadesh barnea there was a group that came out of Egypt with Moses but they were under 20 years old at Kadesh barnea there was the children of those who came out of Egypt with Moses but were under 20 years old at kades spia and then there was those children who were the children of the children of the children who you get the idea right you so okay so let me let me just walk through this really quick right so you have this whole two million people that come out of Egypt with Moses they come to Kadesh Baria and they accept the the report of the 10 spies and they decide not to go into EG into the into the promised land and so and so God punishes them and says well because you've done this and you haven't believed like Caleb and Joshua you are now going to have to wander for 40 years in the desert and everyone 20 years old and upwards will die in the wilderness and not go into the promised land yes sir and these little ones who you said would be a prey they'll go in right can you imagine having turned 20 and we'll get to that later um and so so then you have these that are 19 and and younger and and they're you know there they are they're they're at Kadesh Baria they experienced Egypt themselves and so they're growing up and as they grow up well you got 40 years so those 20 19 year olds can are old enough to get married and have children and those you got 40 years you can go another 20 years and those 20 year olds can have other children and so now you have four generations of people wandering in the wilderness and of course this first generation here they don't they don't get to go in to the promised land and so we we have to set that up because we're going to be dealing with which generation we're in and trying to understand how that impacts who we are and and and our relations with others and so so what is the promised land that we're looking for and so I just wanted to you know we we want to Define that we want to talk about what what we're what it is we're going to and brother brandham says when Sinners plunge beneath the flood and lose all their guilty stains then you're a candidate to follow the Church of God on through this Wilderness journey into the promised land and our promised land is found in John 14 let your hearts let not your hearts be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me for in my father's house there are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and I will come again to receive you unto myself so God is preparing a place and so many of us you know and so much of Christianity just oh God is preparing a place for us for you in heaven don't you want a mansion in heaven it's going to be amazing so many of you probably have little houses don't you you have you have modest homes you know but you wish you had mansions and follow Jesus you can have a mansion this is Christianity there you go follow Jesus he'll give you a mansion it's a good deal like you know it was a monopoly card no we're not going to go there anyway and so and so but that's what we like but that's what they think but right but we miss and I will come again and receive you unto myself what's better than having a mansion in heaven well what's much better than having a mansion in heaven is being with Jesus in The Mansion in heaven that's the whole point I get to be with him how wonderful is that that is our promised land is being with him am today you the church has come through justification through Luther sanctification through Methodist and now up to the time of the promise the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is Promised all through the Old Testament and New too see the Promise behold I send the promise of my father upon you Peter said that on the day of Pentecost that is the promise the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit that's God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world another land you have to come out of the conditions you've been in to come out to live in this promised land to receive the promise remember the promise you shall receive power from on high after this the Holy Ghost is come upon you so you're going to live in this land of the Holy Spirit um and and to live in the power of the spirit now I think one of the problems that we have today even inside of the message is that we limit what the power of the spirit means and what the power of the spirit means means to us is Pentecostal power is is hey you got a demon come on up we're going to cast that out you know you're you you you're sick okay we'll pray for you and you'll be healed you know and and signs and wonders and speaking in tongues and you know and and and and big times at church and all of these things and that's wonderful and that is part of it yes but but but to live in the power of the spirit it's like Oh yay you can you can cast out devils and we know that you can right amen right because you're filled with the Holy Spirit you don't have to be a big preacher you don't have to be a little preacher very well anyway we won't get there and and so and so right even these little guys right because I was 20 and not even a preacher yet and and and and my prayer cured cancer how old are you 21 good time to be praying for people with cancer just anecdotally that's what I think right those that power of the Holy Ghost is for anyone that is our promise to live in that but how strange how strange is it that that that is that is what we focus on and that is okay this these are great because those these things are Supernatural but we forget and we don't talk about and we we like what about just strength what about strength to overcome the problems that I face in my life what about peace what about Joy What About Love what about hope I'm talking about conditions of the P it's another land that we're look think about the land that we're living in right now and think well what if it was actually good that's what I'm talking about living in another land and while we're there why don't we talk about why don't we talk about these that the see this this this idea the problem that we begin to have and and one of the issues that that we face is is if we're not looking and we're not understanding what's going on here and we're not understanding where we are here is we're not understanding how we relate to the word of God and how what our definition of the promised land truly is now I'm going to tell you right here and right now the word of God is the definition for your life for your purpose for the promised land and if you and if you meditate on those things day and night and to do according to all that is written therein your way will be made prosper and you will have good success does that mean you're going to have a big mansion yes but not only that does that mean you'll have big grapes as big as your head to eat in the promised land yes but why limit God why not right now live in another land of the promise of success and prosperity and I'm not even talking about money and name it and claim it and everybody grab your wallet and prophesy I'm not talking about that how miserable is it to name and claim a million dollars into your wallet and still be miserable and bitter and unhappy and no peace and no love and no joy I'm talking about a power of the Holy Spirit what is that to take the mind and the Heart of almighty God from way back before he before he ever created the world and to place all of those thoughts feelings emotions and and qualities in your own heart that's Pro prosperous that's good success that's what I want now that's what I want in my Promised Land don't talk to me I'm out of mansion talk to me about the heart of God coming on the inside of the [Applause] believer right but see but see this first this first group that came out of Egypt you see they have a definition of a promised land that that this third and fourth group they don't have you see this first group came out of Egypt and if you you know and if you talk to one of them and said well what do you think the promised land is and it's like well here I you know if nothing else I can tell you this about the promised land it's not Egypt right you think about if you just take the opposite of what Egypt is was for me that will be my promised land and the second group depending on how old they were in that second group they could say the same thing their definition of the promised land could very easily be not Egypt right I saw what it did to my parents I want no part of that wow I want the promised land to whatever created the conditions of Egypt I don't want any part of that and so then then you come down to the Next Generation who were born in the wilderness they don't have that definition right they've never been to Egypt right and their parents are talking about how bad Egypt was they're grandparents talking about how bad Egypt was man we're going to a Promised Land that's not like Egypt and these these young people you know as their wandering this third and fourth generation no idea what Egypt was might not even be able to find it on a map they're wandering that's all they've known man I was born wandering I turned 10 and I was wandering I got married we were wandering what's the promise land I mean I don't know I mean I've heard it wasn't Egypt but well what was Egypt I don't know kind of sounded bad what do you think the promised land will be like I don't know it's a it's another place it's all they've known as Wilderness the highs and the lows don't mean anything anymore more because they're just in this Freedom State and just as they don't know what to do with their life except for sleep in and do nothing on their definition of what a promised land is can just be another place I mean I've been to a few places you know we were in the wilderness of Zin we were you know sin it's another Wilderness we were in um what was the name of that other Wilderness spot that we were in can't remember it right now of course there's Kadesh Baria um there's a well here and there every now and then you know heard God created one out of you know water out of a rock you know but I mean I don't know I wasn't there I didn't see it we begin to see that that we have to think about some some some of the people that we know some of the the pastors from the days uh uh uh you know from from the older days and some of the some of the grandfathers and some of the fathers and they they they experienced Egypt but so many of us did not and so we have to we have to understand how do we G what what is going to what is going to define the promised land for us there's only going to be one place young people there's only going to be one place for you to find the definition of the promised land and that is the word of God and if you want to get out of the wandering if the wandering gets old and boring and it will and I hope it already is then I what I would say is be like Caleb and Joshua and look into the word of God to find out what he says about you meditate therein day and night be strong and courageous to do all that was written God Joshua goes and throughout the throughout the Book of Joshua Joshua is continually going Moses said Moses said Moses said good thing Joshua was there that had actually heard what Moses said you know and Joshua is what you know we had somebody from the first generation that got to go and tell us what Moses said right but God has God God has done more for us in this age than he did for Joshua on that day because every single one of us can pick up the phone out of our pocket and can go and point to something Moses said you don't rely on your grandfather as great as he might have been to tell you what Moses said you rely on Moses's voice being played in your own ears and there's no reason we shouldn't have we have everything at our disposal to be strong and courageous to do all that our Moses said to take us into to a promised land that he's defining for us and telling us what it is and and and trying to wake us up from our wandering he's saying you're wandering right what are you doing with your life I don't know I guess I'm going to get a job I guess maybe I'll get married and you know I'll do the message thing like everyone else does and then my children they'll do the same thing and what is that that's wandering just wandering we're just doing the things that we've always done we don't really know why because we've we're just Wilderness people we don't know where we've come from we don't know where we're going we're just in the wilderness and God has saying but Moses said what Willam brandom said it's right there for you and if you'll be strong and courageous to face the problems in your life to face to face the problem of the wandering in your own life to say there's a place for you to go but there's only one there's only one way you're going to ever find the definition cuz you were never in a denomination you don't have well what's a what's the Christian Life look like well I can tell you one thing it's not denomination but you were never in one not denomination is nothing it means it's meaningless to the third and the fourth generation not denomination has zero meaning and so what you all are going to have to do is look to the word of God and and meditate on it that it can def because otherwise you will live your life in wandering and you'll go nowhere but in circle after circle after Circle claiming to be a people following God but it's strange to be a people following God in circles and I don't believe God ever wanted us to just be led in circles but he wanted to lead us to a promised land and he gave us the the ability to do it so that we could take that and like Joshua and Caleb be more than just ex-slaves be more than just ex Wanderers but be children of almighty God bestowed by with the virtues that he himself owns and possesses because we've walked through the trials and we've decided I'm not going to wander anymore but I'm going to face the Giants of the promised land and I'm going to turn northward and go forward and when you do that strength will come inside of you so your identity when you get there will not be ex-slave will not be ex Wanderer and part of the promise is is you developing that and walking through that so that you have that when you get there Hallelujah that's truth hallelujah praise the Lord okay we read that we read that okay so you could ask yourself well we are we do not have enough time okay you could ask yourself what kind of Promised Land would God prepare for you right but then you'd have to ask yourself well you know if God was a very bad person he could create a very bad Promised Land If God Was a Very you know um scatterbrained individual you know he might you know he might make a mansion but forget the plumbing and no one wants that and so so the question of what kind of Promised Land would he prepare and and and reminds us of the fact that he it's it's he's going to receive us to himself so the promised land he's preparing is himself the promised land that he's preparing is is to recognize who he is the journey is is is part of the journey is to recognize to get to know who he is and and and here's something and I wish I oh my goodness I wish I had the time we'll talk about it a bit tomorrow morning but but but but but but i' I've I've talked to young people after this Youth Camp so many young people have come to me and they're they're scared of God and how because they they feel like they failed him and it's like I failed God and I you know and and it's like I want you to understand he's a god of love he's a God that wants you to have success he's a God that wants to prosper you and he's given you he's given you the tools to prosper you will you fail of course you'll fail you're in a Wilderness he's not going to punish you for Wilder wessing in the wilderness he's like yeah like oh Lord I fell yeah yeah yeah cuz your legs got tired of wandering of course you fell it's not like you were like oh my goodness I'm gonna I'm I'm so mad at God I'm just going to fall that's what I'm going to do and like okay you have some issues if that's but but I haven't met nobody's ever come to me and told me that brother Trevor I I like to Smite God by falling in my personal life like no one's told me that yet Lord help me I certainly hope that never happens I don't know what I'll say to them right we fail we fall because we're flesh but but we're in this Wilderness God put us in this Wilderness to prove us to test us to to to strengthen us to to get us to recognize that the Wilderness is not our final goal but that he is and so and so to rise up to be strong and courageous to move ourselves into a Wilderness right so so to recog ize who he is and what kind of Promised Land he would prepare so so again we we just see here this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein it is not saying to perfect to do flawlessly to never have an issue no meditate on the word strengthen in the word understand look if the word had enough power that when it was spoken and and said let there be light and there was you know and I told you you could have that kind of power on the inside of your life you'd be like who really that kind of power that says let there be light and there was could could be inside of yeah yeah how do I get that brother Trevor read the word amen listen to the word meditate upon the word let it get down deep on the inside of you to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous it won't just become prosperous you'll have an active part in making your way prosperous and thou shalt have good success well glory to God so so be strong and so if you'll forgive me for this next part I want to I want to bring to you not Joshua 1 5-8 is that okay I hope everyone understands what I say when I say this is not Joshua 1 5-8 this is a rendering of Joshua 1 15-8 that is nothing like what it actually says just for a just to make a point here not Joshua 1 15-8 reads no one will bother you all the days of your life just as I have hovered over others before you I will continue to do so for you I will not leave you or make you do anything anything hard be weak and very cuddled for you will inherit the land which I am giving to the people according to my promise only be weak and excessively pampered that you may avoid anything difficult or challenging and carefully neglect all that you have been commanded that is so good do not strive to the right hand or to the left so that you may remain comfortable wherever you go this book of the law shall stay on your shelf you shall barely acknowledge it day or night that you may avoid the discomfort of action and let mediocrity Define your way there you [Applause] go sounds pretty bad right nobody wants this nobody wants this nobody wants the definition of their life to be this but yet the book of the law often stays on our Shelf barely acknowledged so true so if you don't want this to be your definition right then don't do these things be strong and very courageous becoming strong is part of the promise because because because what we just read not Joshua 15-8 is is no one wants that to be part who they are eating grapes and honey in the promised land you don't want that how' you get here carefully neglected everything I was told tried to be as mediocre as mediocre as possible really that's so what a blessing I'm glad you're with us here in the Promised Land my no no one wants this so you don't want to so so then don't then don't inhabit this kind of inaction in your own life that's right that is so good yeah remembering the Lord I wonder Brethren let's think seriously now we Pentecostal people I wonder if we receive the Holy Ghost just for entertainment but there's more than that goes with it there's a life got to be lived I wonder if that's the hindrance of the churches today Brethren I wonder if that's the reason we're still back here in the wilderness wandering around instead of over in the promised land possessing all things I wonder if there isn't something we haven't thought seriously enough about see we must think seriously and so the challenge is to you tonight Hallelujah that is so do you want to be strong amen do you want to be courageous do you want this to just be entertainment and you know oh man we you know somebody was healed the other day we had tongues and interpretation it's so amazing like all of these things the signs and wonders are happening in our church and man I just love to come and and and Worship the Lord we had such a good song service and then the Lord healed people wow it was amazing man you know and I mean and I get to do this three times three times a week two times a week two times a week for only 10% of my salary price of admission you know I mean it's cheap tickets to our Godly entertainment think seriously now is this what we're doing are we in wandering mindset that I just wander I don't really do anything I don't really participate in anything I'm not trying to be strong I'm not diving into the word of God I'm not actively participating I'm just letting mediocrity to find my way that is so good that is so good and so there we are so I need to move on because I'm combining two sermons into one so we need to get on to be very courageous because I think I've made the point generally about being strong and so now I want to make some points on on being courageous um here so let's go back to this uh well we read this quote we're no longer in Egypt uh we're in the now we're in the wilderness um yeah and let's here we're ready now the church is to my opinion in the spiritual stand to enter in on the third scene and that's the scene we're actually you know the promised land is the third scene here and and we found out they needed healing and they had a doctor with them that was Dr Moses they found out they needed healing because now they've come out of the Wilderness and what what is some of the things they needed healing for it's like well what did they need healing because Dr Moses was with them now okay they needed healing when they when they sinned and they they made God angry and he sent the serpents amongst them and and and Dr Moses put a on a pole and whoever looked on it you know lived and was healed but but the Bible also says that their shoes never were were out and their clothes you know that that the that that that God was with them and God kept them and God God sustained them through the Wilderness way what healing did they need here we go what healing did they need what was it about it so we can come back here through well oh my yes well there was a group that came out of Egypt with Moses that they were here kind of at the start of things um but they're not with us anymore they all died after wandering in the wilderness there's another group that came out of Egypt with them under Moses but they were under 20 years old and Children of the children under 20 and Children of the children children of children of those under 20 yes so just I just want you to think for a moment I want you to put yourselves in the shoes and and and I was aided in this I read a a book of short stories um they biblical stories um and and the the author took kind of fun angles to view a story from you know um maybe you've uh you know adventures and odyssey does that sometimes I don't know if that's still a thing these days but you know you you you enter into a story and you see it from a different angle than maybe the Bible is presenting it just to kind of think through the scenario and put yourselves in shoes and so this this this author took this story of Kadesh barnea from from the son of one of the 10 spies and so if you think about this from from that perspective for a moment so so your dad goes your dad goes and he spies out the promised land and you're so excited like man my dad you know he was he you know you went and talk told your buddies like hey my dad got to be one of the spies yeah yeah real secret stuff you know and he's you know he's INF infiltrating you know with theme music into the promised land coming back with grapes like this is you know it's awesome man and then they come back and the spies come back and they realize oh my goodness the buzz just goes out you know from from the Tabernacle outward into the camp you know and it's like oh my goodness the spies are back and everybody's like they don't have to blow a trumpet you know they just it just it just flies you know through conversation the spies are back and everybody just gathers you know to hear the report of the spies and they're like wow it's an amazing like look at the grapes man there's this cluster of grapes that's you know it's on a pole between Caleb and Joshua oh my goodness this I can't wait they got grapes that big man this is going to be awesome you know and then and then the spies begin to give their report in Caleb and Joshua man it's a great land we can't wait to go take it and the other spies are like whoa you see those grapes yeah they just pop those into their mouths they're that big they got walls it's bad idea people we can't do it and you look at your dad and you're like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa and you're like your you you start telling your friend like I don't know what's up with my dad right now Caleb and Joshua look cool my dad right he's letting me down we you know we've been out here we came out of we came out of Egypt like we're ready to take our promised land no dad Moses said we can take the promised land let's go take the promised land don't like okay I they can be that big but then the the 10 spies are like no and to convince the people it's too hard we can't do it and God judges them and says anybody at the age of 20 you're going to wander well the whole group you're all going to wander for 40 more years and you're like thanks Dad could have been in the promised land but you didn't have any faith Dad good job appreciate that now I get to wonder Dad I just turned 19 yesterday I'm going to be 59 when I go to the get to go to the promised land wow yeah thanks Dad appreciate that and the next day and so he's so mad he's in they come back to the family tent after the meeting and they come back and he's just he's just unleashing his rage on his dad and and and the next day his dad dies can you imagine now you've unleashed your dad uh your rage maybe appropriately on on your father you know for his lack of faith and then probably be respectful young people but you know we just saying you could understand and and and and 59 is you know he's getting up there to enter the promised land when you're 19 and and and you know but then your dad dies the next day and your last conversation with him was one of quite a bit of anger because your dad was one of the 10 spies and they all died the next day and so you're like oh man now you're filled with guilt because you yelled at your dad who you actually loved you were just mad at and you know was complex emotions and now you're you're dealing with a lot and you can't resolve that because now he's dead but can you imagine this second generation now this is who they are they have to deal with we get to you know we get to like through the prime of our life we get to wander through the Wilderness because of a lack of faith because they because they didn't because bless God they didn't what they didn't do is they didn't follow the prophet like they should have they should have adhered to what the prophet had to say and so man as they grew up they're like no what did Moses say bless God that's what we're doing cuz we're going to take a promised land and I don't want my children to have to wander for 40 more years like I did so I going to believe what the prophet said there you go yes sir and there's a lot of nuance in all of that cuz some of you noticed like the change in my voice and you know the different tone and characteristic that came out and some of you are laughing at that and right because this next group the third group was the children of that second group who had the first group as their grandparents like imagine now put yourself in these people like okay we can see the second group like that's okay yeah man bless God follow the prophet but then now you're teaching your children bless God we're going to follow what Moses said we're going to a promised land and they grew up in the wilderness and so you're like follow the prophet to the promised land and you're like what was the promised land again I'm just kind of confused cuz all I know is sand come on it doesn't matter that's it look the promised land doesn't matter to you if you can't follow the prophet that's I mean is that is that wrong well yeah no yeah it's complex does this seem like like I'm talking about the children of Israel in the wilderness or does this seem a little too close to home today here we go and so then you have this fourth generation and the fourth generation has the third generation his parents and the second generation his grandparents and the third generation his parents is like yeah you know okay dad was a little extra but we should follow the prophet well that's what's right you know but I'm just trying to be a little more chill than Dad you know and you know and you know so uh I don't know what to tell you son because you know I'm trying to find balance myself and so because I'm trying to struggle with the balance because I had number two as my dad I'm not I'm I'm struggling myself and so I have to parent you I just you should love Jesus that is so good that is so good and if this isn't like like all I'm doing is I'm talking about the children of Israel I don't know who you people are thinking about ah it's so close to home though right but brother brandham exactly types this for us and he he tells us exactly this is what's going on is Egypt is a type of denomination and we have a prophet and to to to and to listen to The Prophet to take us into a promised land and we have these same generations and we have brother Bram talks about old Fighters and we have you know all of these we have the same generational shift in in and and and brother Bram talks about but in the fourth generation and the Embers are are are just just down to a little bit of a flame and we have to recognize I don't I don't know where you are on this I don't know which generation that you feel you might be in you know I'm somewhere in two and three I can tell you I can tell you I'm somewhere in there myself but what I can tell you is is teaching Sunday school at the Brenham Tabernacle I had the great-grandson of of major word Prophet so hey uh that's four generations you know and he's probably mid 20s now right so so now we can see where we're at and where where we can we can begin to look at this and place that and so brother brandom says and we find out they needed a healing yeah yeah they needed a healing why not because their feet had calluses and not because they you know no because because this this very natural very very natural to situation was upon them generation one their definition was not Egypt generation 2 their definition was not Egypt but just follow a a prophet Generation 3 is born in the wilderness had a dad told me to follow the prophet it seems like that's right want to believe dad but you know just trying to figure out all of this on my own and how to parent my own children and then my children and I'm trying to you know find out what's the reality and what what to bring to them and not to be like Grandpa not to be you know but and so we got to start recognizing this concept because how we parent how we relate to our parents how we relate to our grandparents understanding that these are very natural things and if you were in any one of these groups you would be the same way yeah that's right are you the way I've described in the group that you find yourself in well hey guess what you'll probably right and if we don't if we don't begin to rec like it it is time for us to go and claim our Promised Land but we find we need a healing we need a healing we need to begin to recognize where we at and where we're I began to present this to a Sunday school group and one of the young men started said and I started doing this and I said and that fourth generation they you know they just want all they want to know is is like hey can we get you know the two the two generations in front of me can they can I just not have to deal with their issues and he looked at me he said stop describing me and I was like wow wow okay we're we're on something here and so we find they needed the healing because this this is happening and it's very natural but we need a healing we need to understand where we're at where our where our parents are at our grandparents who we are and how we find ourselves and our parents you know parents need to understand their children may not understand what Egypt is they may not get name I talk about this all the time we got brother Hoover at our church and he came out of a United Pentecostal church I don't know if you all know him but you know tall taller older brother and and have you had him here before yeah okay so brother Hoover and you know you may remember him and you know and I start preaching on coming out of denominations at our church and brother Hoover is one of the deacons so he's in the back and I mean his his long arms go up and he just starts pacing behind you know in the back doors like oh Hallelujah and he's just you know and and I just think you know what there's there's three and four generation this this third group and fourth group they can look back at him and go what is his deal man like he gets so happy about that come out of denomination stuff and it just doesn't do it for me I mean you know hey there might be things brother Trevor says that I like but but coming out of you know but but when God pulled me out of denomination just you know it's just not this is not doing it for me I just don't get excited that God called me out of denominations cuz I don't know what Egypt is we've been delivered out of Egypt well that's great I never was there born right here in the sand in the wilderness right and we've got to recognize the differences that we have and we've got to be able to think each other's thoughts so that we can have this healing that we absolutely need amen and so so that we can come to a place where where where we recognize um who we are you know what our what our experiences are and and and and what God can do in our lives but these things things like dealing with this is not easy because there's some deep seated life hurts going on here and guess what you're going to have to be in order to get over some of these things very courageous that is so good healing requires courage absolutely requires courage I don't have enough time to go my testimony about you know about about having to come into a healing but I I can just say that I went through a time I went through two years of of very chronic pain because of something going on in my neck and and and um and and and finally ended up having surgery but but what what God taught me through that you know um is well first of all let's let's let's just because I love these two statements not bondage is not freedom and we talked about that when we talked about strength and we talked about coming out of Egypt just because they weren't in bondage doesn't mean they were in they were actually free right but in the same way not feeling is not healing so as I'm dealing with this thing this what brought this idea to my mind is is I'm dealing with this problem with my neck and I'm going to the pain you know I had a few of the epidural shots in my neck to try to get the swelling down and things like that and and um um because I had a ruptured disc and and so we're trying to to get healing from that trying to trying to avoid surgery trying to do physical therapy and and um and and and so another thing they they were like okay well there's this other thing we can do and so why don't you come in we'll test you and if you pass these tests then you're eligible for this other thing and it's like okay I'm in pain that'd be nice let's do whatever the you know whatever it is okay and so they said okay so what we need you to do what this is is we're going to inject you in these little spots and then if you have any relief at all you have to note that down even if it's 5 minutes or 30 seconds you've got to note that down and tell us because then you'll eligible to get the insurance to have this thing done and so then what we can do is we can you know we can burn your nerve endings so you won't feel the pain anymore you know you know and I you know it's like your face you know your shirt's off your face down you know they're about to with needles over hovering over your back you know and you're like you know you know your your first reaction is like what you know it's like which is a bad idea and so so don't do that with needles over top of you you know and I was like hang on H you know I was like and I was like you're gonna you're gonna burn my perfectly good nerve endings so you're you're gonna make me worse so that I don't feel this sounds like a bad deal like I I I'm probably not you know okay it's like do the thing and I'll tell you but uh I'm probably not coming back for that and so they but it gave me no relief so it didn't matter but but I was like I was like no no no no no just be like you can take away the feeling of pain but that doesn't mean I'm Healed and there's too often we seek to remove the feeling of pain because it's easier I can go to the doctor and have him burn away my perfectly good nerve endings but if I'm actually if I decide to be very courageous though I can do the work that needs to be done to get to the healing point and God and God and and and what God showed me through this whole thing because I had a brother telling me like hey man you need to confess it and I was like you think I don't know that like no no no no like you know like you're treating me like I can actually in my pain State I can actually take the word of God do meditate on it do all that it says to do like confess my healing like brother brandham talks about and and and and that I'm going to be healed like like you're acting like I'm a real believer who's going to actually do what God asked asked me to do no no no no you don't understand that's fine for church but I'm in pain I'm in pain no no no no I'll just come and do the church thing you pray for me because I'm in pain yeah there you go don't ask me while I'm hurt to have to be spiritual uhuh it don't work that way I can't do that I'm in pain I don't want to I don't I want to confess to people that I'm Healed are you kidding me I'm standing here look like this I'm like yeah and like there's this pain face going on that I can't even replicate right now like I'm I'm in pain like you I don't want to go like ow thank the Lord for healing me you doing fine yep just fine no problems you know any problems with your neck nope nope no problems just spent four hours on the heating pad last night no problems I'm Healed in Jesus name I I didn't want to do that I didn't want to participate in my own healing I just wanted God to come and heal I just wanted my healing to look like this yeah you're healed and then there's zero courage in my life I'm never I've never gained and I tell you what God has courage oh yes God has courage to face nothingness and Proclaim light into it woo come on somebody God has courage to look into nothingness and to speak light into existence then I think then I thank you brother Ben then I think we can we can have the courage to face the problems and the Blackness and the Darkness and the issues that we face and I I get it I've been there I know it's hard and I didn't want to do it but God used that situation to to to to say Trevor what you need is some courage to do what the word of God says to do Hallelujah Hall and if I learned that and developed courage in my own life then the neck problems and the pain that I faced for two years was completely worth it because it took took a preacher who just thought you know Church stuff is just church stuff but when you get impacted in life you know well hey now other Church people can help me and he exposed the problems in my own heart in my own faith and so so he asked me said come up higher why don't you ask like no no we don't compartmentalize Church stuff and healing when when when everything's fine and when you're at church but it doesn't impact actual life no this is for all of your life and so if the word of God can do that then the word of God can do that in you and and through your lips as well you can speak Let There light be light and there can be light you can speak healing and there will be and it doesn't always happen right now but God is working in you that courage he's not picking you up from here to there and doing it but he's allowing you to face courageously the issues that are facing your own life and I was I was I've been I've been uh I've been working with a sister we've been we've been doing a lot of counseling and she had gotten to a very low place in her life and a lot of issues and a lot of you know a lot of things that she was running to to numb her pain to burn the nerve endings and she'd gotten so used to doing this and I was I'm just talking it's like you've got to rest this you've got to stop this cycle and but there's so many sins and so many problems I'm like I don't care about the sins don't I don't even want you to repent to the sins the sins aren't the problem it's like what what do you mean the sins AR the of course sins are the problem sins are the problem of everything no you need healing you need to face your problems courageously and well well there's so many of them like I don't want you to do all of them find the smallest one and courageously face that one and get over that one it's say well should I Repent then no I don't care about repentance yet let God heal you God knows that the problem that the things that you're doing are are are medications for the healing that the it's the healing is the thing and I know that God has done something in your life and if you face these things courageously you'll come out of your Wilderness mindset that's all you are you're doing Wilderness stuff hallelujah what is repentance repentance is stop doing Wilderness stuff hallah you can say you're sorry 50,000 times but repentance is you know this wandering right that's so good I hate my life I do so many wandering things like God must hate me cuz I wander all the time like well hey well there's Giants over there woo yeah just I don't know how to face those giants this is a metaphor till someday you decide you know what I'm actually going to repent that's my Promised Land I'm going to stop wandering this is repentance this is repentance that's my Promised Land you you're not on your knees you're not saying I'm sorry I I'm actually I'm actually proving that I am sorry Hallelujah yes sir I'm actually displaying my repentance and I'm facing with C Courage the issues that I'm facing I'm facing with Courage the patterns that my life has fallen into am and and and as we be as I begin to deal with a sister we begin to work through things one by one and you know St you know she she'd begin to just stay late and tears and tears and tears why cuz the pain was real and she had to go she had to C it's not called just you know it's courage for a reason right but she courageously fac them small one by one and took care of issue after issue and then began and began having conversations with people that she needed to make things right with conversations with her family conversations with her husband hard difficult conversations but begin to face these things she's I mean just like it's just a complete total change hallu living in Victory still you know is there is there still times when when the wander comes back yeah yeah yeah it's a journey to the promised land right but God is calling you to strength and courage and saying by that strength that strength and courage are part of your Promised Land part of the qualities that you want in the promised land is what you what I'm asking you to gain as you get there amen isn't God good yes he is he's so good that he doesn't pick us up and drop us over there as losers right no he says I know what's inside of you right so be strong am be courageous and you can inherit your Promised Land you will make your way prosperous you will make your way with good success amen and so brothers and sisters it's time it's time to get out of the wandering musicians why don't you come brother Bram says sister in that wheelchair and stretcher God promised you your healing you'll have to fight every inch of it the devil will make you fight with the sword of God every inch but remember footsteps is a possession wherever your foot Treads that I'll give to you every step you can make you know that gets me feeling religious footsteps is possession and the land that your feet will tread upon in this promised land it's yours all the land that your feet will tread upon in this promised land is yours do you have the courage it will not be easy it will not be fun but it will be good am it will be wonderful and it will take you to your Promised Land it will it is worth doing yes because of who it makes you into so maybe if we just look one more time there at verse eight this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou May observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success so he's asking you be strong very courageous get into the word do what the word says begin to recognize we're in a Wilderness and we need to turn ourselves and and and and aim and and come out of wilderness mindset and go no we have purpose we have vision Vision we have a goal and that's set and given to us by the word of God our destination is given to us by the word of God and how to get there is Joshua kept saying Moses told us we should do it this way well brothers and sisters brother brandham has told us do it this way go this direction this is where it's at brothers and sisters follow the word follow the word amen shall we pray Lord Lord we need you so much we're we're so thankful for your word Lord we recognize that we have a part in this to be strong and very courageous oh [Music] god father I know the challenge is Big Lord and that that we do need the healing your Prophet talked about we find they need a healing Lord we need a healing and we need to [Music] we need to be courageous Lord in getting there we need to have strength Lord Jesus to begin to walk but Lord all of this is all of this is found for us in the word of God so Lord I pray that we would be diligent Lord to dive into the word of God that the young people would recognize that their Wilderness mindset can be overcome by the word of God that the power of let there be light can reside in them as well Lord and that you're not mad at us you're not angry with us you're not but you're there waiting and saying I I have a promised land for you and and and I've given you I've given you the strength if you if you just look at it if you just take it into your heart and begin to live it the strength would be there the courage would be there Lord may we fall in love with you all over again may we fall in love with your word all over again Lord Jesus Lord May the generational differences between us Lord may we begin to understand that and have Grace for one another and recognize our own needs Lord Jesus and help one another oh God and oh Lord take us to a promised land lord Jesus but don't pick us up and carry us there Lord Lord may we gain identity as a child of God as we March onward turning northward to the promised land lord we love you I just pray that these

his power the we may be strong is strength is wor his strength is [Music] per what a perspective amen I make you say Amen tonight what a perspective Hallelujah you know brother Bram was on his way back to Jeffersonville to preach the message The Trail Of The Serpent and I can tell you that message was preached right there's not a message you'll find by that title but that message was preached because this message which is none other than Jesus Christ has took the cover off of the enemy and what I love about it is as the word keeps on coming down it takes the cover we can read where brother B says Satan wants to discredit the word and he would like to destroy the church and he said he'll always be at that until he's thrown in the Lake of Fire and you know one of the things and the ways to do that and one of the ways he'll try is not just to tell you or I that it's not for us but he likes to take that in a way and have some Mirage painted up like what brother Trevor I'll tell you I don't think we'll ever get that out of our mind we may have laugh but that was true amen that's not how God operates right God's operate is that his word would become so alive in our hearts and and you know how it does that when we talk about the word behav preeminence it starts with you let the word you let the word come in it'll start out like a little white button but it'll grow you keep taking the word of God and giving ourselves to the word it is not about our feelings there's going to be times where you don't feel like a Christian you feel like God's A Million Miles Away their feelings we've said it we've heard it over and over that has nothing to do with it right it's taking God's word and there listen there is no other place in this world I'm not preaching but there's no other word that there's no other place in this world where there's any other certainty right I don't care you can take a politician that says I'm going to do X Y and Z when I get in the office that's not certain there's one thing and only one thing that is certain and that's the word of God Amen there's only one thing like God brought us here in this Simplicity to think about it you and I it's not something that's a a pipe dream the prophet tell us it's not a pipe dream it's right here and you know what you don't have to wait till you have a certain feeling do you have a certain sensation to get in the word of God because it's the word of God you get in the word of God because it's what God has said and that word will have an effect it has transforming power within it I tell you what what God has done here once again tonight he's come by and this is just something that he'll do right there in our services when he comes right by just like when brother Nathaniel's standing there and ministering the word comes through and it breathes a courage into our hearts but it wasn't something as just like a wind that passes through oh man that was a nice wind no God did that purposely yes he did he may have had a minister that he looked at a quote looked at a scripture and he's thinking I don't know where this even fits but that's good that's wonderful I don't know where it fits many times I don't know where and you're and all of a sudden in the middle of ministering God will drop a thought and that will be given you know why God reserved that because he knew you and I had need of it and it's God God strengthening you and I encouraging us to say keep pressing keep pressing be strong be courageous keep pressing so the Mirage that Satan wants to wants to point out is that you know he he'll like to take the word that we have it's a glorious bride man it's an invincible Army my but we don't want his spin on the word we don't want Satan spin it's an invincible Army by a person and people who are yielded to an invincible God see it takes away the mirages because we get to looking at things that that that's not true that Mirage is not true in the way that Satan's presenting it but it is true in that God being God through you and me I'll tell you you talking about Redemption you talking about power is that God himself not only what he did through the Lord Jesus Christ but then to come into you and I who were born in sin and shaped in iniquity and the power of redemption to take a hold of our life and for that word to work in our life you talking about you know you and I if we could just even get a glimpse and I believe that's what God has done not only tonight but he's done it in every one of your services our services and is God himself stepping back and he's looking at his victory in our lives his victory that's what Calvary brought to you and I it released his victory to you and I that you and I might walk in Victory and to be able to think about that he's looking he's looking at the product of what his blood has purchased he's seeing the effect of his word in our lives oh my I believe he's pleased yes I believe he's pleased his presence not only coming down to speak to us but it's to encourage us keep making footsteps keep going forward there's no going back God that's with healing has gone to let brother Trevor give that example with Benjamin here tonight applying to Healing bringing it down into our lives and with things that we that God brings us to to face that we can look at sometimes and say I haven't wanted to go here I haven't wanted to go there it's like one of those places you don't want nobody to touch in your life but you realize God is saying right now it's time it's time it's time you know what he comes down and he don't leave us he goes with us he goes with us he's the one that comes and walks right inside of us to strengthen you and I to give us courage to face that because he's manifesting his victory over every complex over every hindrance over every hurt over every wound over every trap he's the Mighty God that's right he's a mighty conqueror that's right hallelujah oh friends what a healing what a [Music] healing Moses didn't have a big old bag he just had a bag and every time he wred in that bag you've heard the Prophet sayth this was wrong that was wrong he reached in the back I'm the Lord that heals that applied to every situation aren't you grateful for the God's mercy if we leave out of here with anything else and here you think about that I'm not going to go in circles no more no matter what it is don't don't just see once again don't let that Mirage be put out there and say well you know hey I'm I'm already a full-fledged believer but you can be going in circles in your promised land and you're not even going around Jericho so I say God I don't want to go in circles I want to be honest with myself I I want to go forward if God spoke to me tonight and he did he spoke to every one of us this it was not just something was just scattered in one or two he had brought it and he'd had sent it just for one person but it for every one of us Lord whatever it is wherever at in my life where I'm at I don't want to go in a circle no more in that area I want to go forward in the strength and the courage of almighty God amen from the youngest to the oldest I want to go forward don't you love him don't you appreciate him Oh my he sent his word and he healed his people oh my my my my my blessed be the name of the Lord God is so good could we sing that song God is so good amen and we'll just stand and my God is so good oh God he so good know he's so good yes oh sing it personal Now sing God he so good I know God is so good yes God he is so good he so good [Music]
