[41:11] [Applause]
[41:12] [Music]
[41:38] [Music]
[41:47] [Music]
[41:49] I'm not
[41:55] to
[41:58] [Music]
[42:20] love the Lord this morning so good to be
[42:25] in the house of the Lord amen you really
[42:30] sound like you're having a wonderful
[42:32] time
[42:34] and I believe that's what serving the
[42:36] Lord is about it's not just here but
[42:39] it's it's every moment of our life well
[42:41] we got a reason to be joyful
[42:43] we got a reason to be happy amen and
[42:46] he's worthy of all worship all honor and
[42:50] glory I think about you know that that
[42:53] morning you know even though we know
[42:54] it's not this time of the year but you
[42:56] think when the Shepherd's themselves
[42:58] were we're told by the Lord go and they
[43:03] came to the place of where he was and
[43:05] they begin to worship they begin to
[43:08] worship based on what was made known to
[43:10] them and that in that time oh my that's
[43:14] why we worship that's why we worship of
[43:17] what God has done for our hearts what
[43:20] he's done and how he's made himself
[43:22] known to us you know when you when you
[43:24] worship when you're singing songs and
[43:26] things what do you think about I don't
[43:28] just think about the words but I think
[43:30] about how those words and what it means
[43:32] to me and how what he is to me because
[43:35] every one of these songs that we sing
[43:37] every one of these songs are born out of
[43:39] an experience real songs are born out of
[43:43] the experience that's why David could
[43:45] say that thou has encompassed me about
[43:47] with songs of deliverance they're not
[43:49] just words you know anybody can write
[43:51] words and rhyme words and reverence
[43:53] presence and things like that that
[43:54] anybody can do that but when it is by
[43:57] and experienced and I'm talking about
[44:00] things that people have been through
[44:02] it's something about it that it's it's a
[44:04] part of a life that's being expressed
[44:06] and you realize that this whole book
[44:09] that we know as and call the Bible as
[44:11] the inspired Word of God is a great
[44:13] redemptive song it has many parts to it
[44:17] many verses some verses that were you
[44:21] know in part where you had a lead part
[44:23] and then once that lead part you know
[44:24] how the rest would blend
[44:26] in but everything in itself love us for
[44:29] one goal and one purpose and that is for
[44:34] the great plan of redemption Amen that
[44:37] you and I might be made free set in
[44:42] Liberty now in this life and made ready
[44:45] for when God completely renovates this
[44:49] place here and then we come back here to
[44:52] dwell in this place that's that's the
[44:54] great hope isn't it
[44:55] we thank God we see the change that it
[44:57] brings to our life that what a true hope
[45:00] that it gives us to know that soon and
[45:02] very soon we're gonna be leaving soon in
[45:06] verse in one of these one of these days
[45:08] one of these objects say like this one
[45:10] of these moments Maz will say it that
[45:12] way whether it's a minute whether it's a
[45:14] second it's gonna be a moment here any
[45:17] moment
[45:17] Amen well we just certainly love you in
[45:21] the presence of the Lord if we could
[45:23] let's turn to Luke chapter 24 I'd like
[45:26] to say we want to welcome sister well
[45:27] Sam's mother it's good to have you here
[45:29] with us
[45:30] god bless you amen James brother it's

[45:36] to have you
[45:37] amen good they have each and every one
[45:41] of you well I'll tell you the Friends of
[45:47] the Lord's are so sweet isn't it I just
[45:52] was enjoying it back there my office man
[45:59] well let's look here in Luke 24 verse 13
[46:03] and behold two of them went that same
[46:08] day to a village called Emmaus which was
[46:11] from Jerusalem about threescore furlings
[46:13] and they talked together of all these
[46:16] things which had happened and it came to
[46:19] pass that while they commune together
[46:21] and reasoned Jesus himself drew near and
[46:25] went with them but their eyes were
[46:28] hoping that they should not know him and
[46:32] he said unto them what manner of
[46:36] communications are these that you have
[46:39] to another as ye walk and are sad and
[46:44] one of them whose name was Clio pious
[46:46] answering said unto Him art thou only a
[46:49] stranger in Jerusalem and has not known
[46:51] to things which are come to pass there
[46:53] in these days and he said unto then he
[46:57] said unto them what thing and they said
[47:01] unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth
[47:04] which was a prophet mighty in deed and
[47:07] word before God and all the people and
[47:10] how the chief priests and our rulers
[47:12] delivered him to be condemned to death
[47:15] and have crucified Him but we trusted
[47:19] that it had been he which should have
[47:21] redeemed Israel and beside all this
[47:24] today is the third day since these
[47:26] things were done yay and certain women
[47:28] also of our company made us astonished
[47:31] which were early at the sepulchre and
[47:33] when they found not his body they came
[47:35] saying that they had seen a vision of
[47:37] angels which said that he was alive and
[47:40] certain of them which were with us went
[47:42] to the sepulchre and found it even so as
[47:44] the women had said that him they saw not
[47:47] then he said unto them o fools and slow
[47:51] of heart to believe all that the
[47:54] prophets have spoken ought not Christ to
[47:57] have suffered these things and to enter
[47:59] into his glory and beginning at Moses
[48:02] and all the prophets he expounded unto
[48:05] them in all the Scriptures the things
[48:08] concerning himself the Bible says they
[48:11] drew nine to the village whether they
[48:13] went and he made as though he would have
[48:17] gone further but they constrained him
[48:20] saying abide with us for it is toward
[48:23] evening and the day is far spent and he
[48:26] went in to tarry with him and it came to
[48:28] pass as he said it meet with him he took
[48:31] bread and blessed it and brake it and
[48:34] gave to them and their eyes were opened
[48:36] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[48:39] their sight and they said one to another
[48:41] did not our heart burn within us while
[48:44] he talked with us by the way and while
[48:47] he opened to us the scriptures and they
[48:51] rose up the same hour
[48:53] and returned to Jerusalem and found the
[48:57] 11 gather together in them that were
[48:59] with them saying the Lord is risen
[49:01] indeed and hath appeared to sign them
[49:04] let's just bow our heads
[49:06] Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our
[49:10] hearts and our heads and your presence
[49:12] you know father the needs or God that
[49:16] are present here
[49:17] Lord God and those Lord that even would
[49:20] be streaming you know Lord every need Oh
[49:23] God and you are the supplier of all
[49:26] things that we have need of father I
[49:29] pray that God that you would come in
[49:31] such a special way Lord this morning and
[49:34] father just as our desire is to invite
[49:37] you in Lord that you would come and
[49:39] break the bread of life to our hearts or
[49:42] God and may our hearts burn within us
[49:45] Lord and father I pray that all God that
[49:48] for every every request of God upon
[49:51] every heart for every soul that's here
[49:54] oh God may father each and every one
[49:57] receive Lord of the redemptive blessings
[49:59] of the Lord Jesus Christ granit Lord
[50:03] according to Lord the needs Lord that we
[50:05] have we committed in your hands now in
[50:07] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[50:10] and may God bless you as you're being
[50:12] seated I want to continue that thought
[50:15] on victory over discouragement we began
[50:20] looking at this last week with the
[50:22] disciples where they were at we see in
[50:29] this opening portion of Scripture here
[50:31] as we've looked with discouragement that
[50:34] it's something that each of us come face
[50:39] to face with and each of us have to deal
[50:43] with it maybe even this morning you're
[50:47] sitting here and you're somewhat
[50:49] discouraged but I say that maybe in your
[50:53] present circumstances I could say that
[50:55] yes that you could have every right in
[50:58] the world to be discouraged at present
[51:00] circumstances and maybe conditions or
[51:02] afflictions but if we can look away too
[51:05] we're encouragement and the real source
[51:07] of encouragement comes from from the
[51:10] Lord Jesus Christ himself I believe as a
[51:14] witness that he is more than able to
[51:17] provide for you and I just what we need
[51:20] and I believe that he's able to open our
[51:23] eyes that we'll be able to see beyond
[51:25] the discouragement the circumstances the
[51:28] letdowns the disappointments and we'll
[51:30] be able to really to see him because
[51:32] when we can look to him in that way it
[51:35] changes our life it changes an attitude
[51:38] you know because when we get discouraged
[51:40] we could spend you know from now to
[51:42] eternity in the Psalms David didn't you
[51:45] know try to hide it and act like well I
[51:47] never get discouraged as a matter of
[51:48] fact David himself would actually talk
[51:51] to himself you know David you know he
[51:53] didn't have an imaginary friend he had
[51:55] the Lord but David also would talk to
[51:57] himself how many times in Psalms and I
[51:59] find it especially when you get around
[52:01] the Messianic Psalms in between those
[52:04] times where he would say take joy in my
[52:06] soul why aren't they'll cast down hope
[52:08] thou and the Lord you see David was
[52:10] directing he was discouraged there was
[52:12] times when things came around there were
[52:14] times when David was misunderstood there
[52:17] was times when you know Saul was after
[52:19] him and David wasn't a threat to Saul
[52:21] but David as a matter of fact he did
[52:24] everything that he could he respected
[52:26] the anointing of the Lord even when you
[52:28] know those had had mentioned to him and
[52:30] said go in and take his life right now
[52:32] but David at the mouth of the cave you
[52:34] know he stood upon the word he was one
[52:36] that would stand upon that word and he
[52:38] said I hadn't let it I'm not gonna touch
[52:40] the Lord's anointed he is anointed of
[52:43] God and David you know even in that time
[52:45] of being misunderstood and run here and
[52:47] run there but yet he would take
[52:49] encouragement from the things of the
[52:51] Lord and you know sometimes when we're
[52:53] looking at that and taking that
[52:55] encouragement from the things of the
[52:56] Lord it isn't that all of a sudden that
[52:58] the discouragement and anything else
[53:00] goes away but there's a path that opens
[53:02] up to us that we UNR that we and
[53:05] ourselves can actually look unto the
[53:07] Lord as the Bible would say I love the
[53:09] scripture then I will lift up mine eyes
[53:11] unto the hills from whence cometh my
[53:13] help my help cometh from the Lord and
[53:15] that scripture you know sometimes many
[53:18] times we quote
[53:18] it's in songs but that scripture was
[53:21] written in mind by an experienced when
[53:23] they would be in the heat of the battle
[53:25] and as they were in the heat of the
[53:26] battle there in the valley but yet there
[53:29] would be a messenger one who would run
[53:31] across the hills and would bring to them
[53:33] a message that of reinforcements a
[53:36] message of encouragement and strength
[53:38] and David could say I could lift up mine
[53:40] eyes unto the hills from whence cometh
[53:42] my help my help cometh from the Lord I
[53:45] believe that every time that God has
[53:47] brought in encouragement in our lives I
[53:50] believe that even when it's been
[53:52] something that maybe somebody has
[53:54] dropped you a word maybe about Tex card
[53:57] what-have-you
[53:57] I believe that that comes from God I
[54:00] just don't I don't believe those things
[54:02] are loose like that I I know as a matter
[54:04] of fact there's things were text and
[54:06] cards that I've got that some of them
[54:08] are from when I even first started
[54:09] pastoring here of things and you say
[54:11] brother Samuel that that seems awful
[54:13] silly I don't think it all it seems
[54:15] silly I think it ought to be these
[54:16] things that we ought to be able to
[54:18] encourage yourself in the things of God
[54:20] even when David himself remember when
[54:22] God had revealed to him the vision about
[54:25] in the opening of the building the
[54:26] temple but then God comes around and
[54:28] lets David know you're not going to be
[54:30] the one that's going to do it but David
[54:32] said nevertheless I'm going to pray for
[54:34] what you have revealed that it will come
[54:36] to pass and David even in the midst of
[54:38] this time he would find himself in in
[54:40] times where discouragement but yet he
[54:43] would encourage himself in the things of
[54:45] God and to think of how that the Lord
[54:47] would encourage David in that time he
[54:49] reminded him where I brought you from
[54:51] and you see God has a way of reminding
[54:54] you and I of where he brought us from
[54:56] don't ever take that for granted don't
[54:59] ever let that get old those are places
[55:01] as we've seen already in the scripture
[55:03] God took Moses back to the mountain even
[55:06] to the prophet in this hour
[55:08] he took him right back and he showed him
[55:10] here his commission and he were bringing
[55:13] back into these precious places of
[55:15] sacred sands of God's grace and reminds
[55:18] him of where he is brought in from
[55:19] because the reality is when you've had
[55:22] that experience within your heart that's
[55:24] nothing that you can ever get away from
[55:26] because it is something that you have
[55:28] become one with
[55:29] and it'll stabilize you in the midst of
[55:32] everything else that might be chaos
[55:34] falling all around you and things that
[55:36] you can't figure out but yet you've got
[55:38] a place where you can set your feed a
[55:41] place that is an absolute that no matter
[55:43] what is taking place it's just like when
[55:46] things take place on your job and things
[55:48] unfold and you think my goodness I
[55:50] didn't see it going this way and maybe
[55:52] you get a new boss so you get to know
[55:53] somebody else and they've got a brand
[55:55] new vision and the vision is lets up
[55:57] heave the whole department let's just
[55:59] redo it over and you're thinking man
[56:01] everything was going just right I had
[56:03] everything everything just seemed to be
[56:04] set but you see within the midst of that
[56:07] time it's things sometimes that happen
[56:09] and we we don't realize what what it is
[56:11] that's going on but as a believer this
[56:14] is where there is ground that we can
[56:16] stand on and say lord I know that you
[56:19] have my life in your hands you have it
[56:23] in control it's a time where we find
[56:25] ourselves examining Lord that there not
[56:28] be any sin there not being any unbelief
[56:30] in my life why because there is a
[56:32] certainty of a place in God where a
[56:34] believer can stand and rest and when all
[56:37] circumstances are taking place and you
[56:39] don't know what's coming next
[56:41] you can rest in him who holds your life
[56:44] and who holds your future you can rest
[56:47] because those are not shifting sands a
[56:50] man's reasoning that is an experience
[56:52] that founded upon the solid rock of the
[56:55] Lord Jesus Christ no matter what comes
[56:58] you've got an anchor and that is very
[57:03] important you see these events that had
[57:06] transpired that they are making known to
[57:09] the Lord Jesus have you heard about the
[57:11] things are you a stranger here you see
[57:14] they're asking in regards to events
[57:17] these events that have Trank taken place
[57:19] they have transpired remember the
[57:21] scripture that we looked at here last
[57:23] week out of Matthew 26 I believe verse
[57:25] 37 or so where the Lord Jesus himself
[57:28] bringing up the prophecy from Zechariah
[57:30] 13:8 that that the sword awaken my sword
[57:34] and as and saith the Lord of Hosts and
[57:36] smite my fellow and strike smite that
[57:39] Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered
[57:40] you see
[57:42] he spoke this and each one of the
[57:44] Gospels you'll find how that this was
[57:46] addressed that there was going to be
[57:48] that of where the sheep themselves would
[57:50] be scattered and you know when you when
[57:52] you look at it as Jesus said you're
[57:55] gonna be offended in me this night now I
[57:57] want to deal with that a little bit more
[57:58] this morning you see it was Anna
[58:01] stumbling or an offence is an impediment
[58:03] it's a stumbling block it's something
[58:05] that gets in the way and this what was
[58:08] taking place was an impediment it was
[58:11] something that was a stumbling to them
[58:13] they could not understand it but you see
[58:15] this is what's important it's not
[58:18] important that we understand everything
[58:23] all the time at that moment but it is
[58:26] important that we walk in the
[58:29] understanding that God has opened to us
[58:32] the light and as we walk in that then
[58:35] God will bring to light those things
[58:37] because let me tell you something as
[58:39] they believer in God friends it's not
[58:42] our effort that catches it it's it's
[58:44] God's promise to his word and we're a
[58:47] part of that word it's just like when in
[58:49] Allah when Elijah the spirit of Elijah
[58:51] came and John the Baptist was here on
[58:53] earth and I want you to think of this
[58:55] they come right off the mountain there
[58:57] where the Lord Jesus has been
[58:59] transfigured before them and they come
[59:01] off of there and Jesus had told him he
[59:02] said don't you say nothing about this
[59:04] vision until the Son of Man is suffered
[59:06] and rise again the Bible says in mark 9
[59:09] 17 that they begin questioning in
[59:11] themselves talking among themselves what
[59:13] is he saying Rees rise again and you
[59:16] look at it they didn't need to
[59:17] understand it at that moment it will
[59:19] even of all their human ability even
[59:21] don't listen to me now the Lord Jesus
[59:23] Christ himself had spoken that word yet
[59:27] if the understanding was not to be
[59:29] loosened in that moment but yet the very
[59:32] next scripture there in Matthew 17 with
[59:34] that same event would actually record
[59:36] why do the scribes and Pharisees say
[59:38] then Elisha shall Thomas must first come
[59:41] and Jesus says him--not Elias has come
[59:44] he has come already he says and then he
[59:47] breaks into the second fold of that in
[59:48] Malachi four five and six
[59:50] he shall truly come and restore all
[59:52] things then the Bible says
[59:54] they're in the verse then they
[59:57] understood that he spake unto them
[59:59] concerning John the Baptist Jesus never
[1:00:02] mentioned John's name one time in that
[1:00:06] whole thing he never mentions John's
[1:00:07] name but what was it was it just the
[1:00:09] Lord Jesus himself actually him the
[1:00:12] physical the body wasn't that that he
[1:00:14] was speaking it it was the Spirit of God
[1:00:17] that was dwelling there behind that veil
[1:00:19] of fish and it was time for them to
[1:00:22] understand these things in that hour I'm
[1:00:25] glad that God has that reserve and it
[1:00:27] could bring a rest to you and I but you
[1:00:29] and I do not have to be frustrated don't
[1:00:31] try to pry into anything when people try
[1:00:34] to pry into anything listen friends
[1:00:35] prying into anything is where you begin
[1:00:38] to get into your own self self efforts
[1:00:41] drawing out this chart putting out this
[1:00:43] putting out that I'm not saying that
[1:00:45] certain things are wrong but I'm saying
[1:00:47] that we need to be careful that we're
[1:00:48] not trying to bring self effort and
[1:00:50] trying to bring understanding that way
[1:00:52] but we need to say lord help me Lord God
[1:00:55] that you would open your word and make
[1:00:58] yourself known to me because self effort
[1:01:00] is always something that will produce
[1:01:02] pride and pride itself is where a person
[1:01:05] can become so lifted up to where that
[1:01:07] they're not able to really see the
[1:01:09] unfolding even though things are seeing
[1:01:12] speaks of the unfolding but they're not
[1:01:14] able to see what it is that actually
[1:01:16] they believe is before him it's a state
[1:01:21] of discouragement that these disciples
[1:01:23] were in they were going the opposite way
[1:01:27] of where they needed you know their
[1:01:29] their hopes were crushed their hopes
[1:01:33] were crushed they said we helped we
[1:01:37] trusted it had been he that should
[1:01:40] redeem Israel they didn't know but
[1:01:45] Redemption was already taking place what
[1:01:49] they did know is redemption itself you
[1:01:52] know this coming from the mind of God to
[1:01:54] even where the very birth of the Lord
[1:01:56] Jesus Christ of how that God had
[1:01:58] provided now a blood cell that was free
[1:02:01] from the blood that was already here and
[1:02:03] polluted and then that day on the River
[1:02:06] Jordan of where the
[1:02:07] or Jesus comes walking down there at the
[1:02:09] River Jordan and the Spirit of God steps
[1:02:12] down to claim that part of the word that
[1:02:14] Tabernacle that he himself had built
[1:02:17] that he had pitched and he was going to
[1:02:19] come and dwell in that body and through
[1:02:21] him by the shed blood deliver you and I
[1:02:23] redemption itself was unfolding right
[1:02:25] there there had to be one on earth that
[1:02:28] God Himself could unite with that God
[1:02:30] Himself who is the Redeemer be able to
[1:02:33] become one of us become flesh run the
[1:02:35] redemption was already going on but yet
[1:02:38] their understanding to it was not opened
[1:02:40] but it was not needed in this moment
[1:02:43] that the understanding would be opened
[1:02:45] in that time but you can see what
[1:02:47] happens when you know things themselves
[1:02:49] do not go according to one's thinking
[1:02:52] and that's all of us you get in a state
[1:02:55] of discouragement you know friends if we
[1:02:58] can really really take it in this way
[1:03:00] you know there are things that even when
[1:03:03] brother Branham was standing there and
[1:03:04] he would see the church coming in
[1:03:06] preview brother Brown never ever if you
[1:03:08] watch this right here but the Branham
[1:03:10] takes the thing you thin this here and
[1:03:12] he never looks at it and says well then
[1:03:14] preachers what they did he never did it
[1:03:16] he said is this the best that we could
[1:03:18] do for you
[1:03:19] you see he's looking at I'm not going to
[1:03:21] put blame of the problem on other people
[1:03:23] I'm gonna stand right here because you
[1:03:26] see where it was the confidence is God
[1:03:28] has already revealed the word there is
[1:03:30] coming a bride this word is going to
[1:03:32] bring forth a bride the Lord Jesus
[1:03:34] Christ will indeed have a bride here in
[1:03:38] the end time that will reflect that one
[1:03:40] that was born straight from the hand of
[1:03:42] God on the day of Pentecost he was able
[1:03:45] to stand there within that and take
[1:03:47] courage let me tell you something
[1:03:48] brother Branham oh my he would have
[1:03:50] dreamed to a preach in a congregation
[1:03:53] like this with people who are believers
[1:03:55] and and holding fast to the word but you
[1:03:58] know what it wasn't his a lot to be here
[1:04:01] to minister but the word itself that was
[1:04:04] to come into fruition and be manifested
[1:04:07] that was delivered and the same one who
[1:04:09] delivered at the same age of the Lord
[1:04:11] who opened it to the Prophet is the same
[1:04:14] one who opens it to you and I it wasn't
[1:04:17] enough that God left us tapes and books
[1:04:19] that
[1:04:19] enough it ain't enough that we have a
[1:04:22] Bible that's not enough it more than
[1:04:26] reading more the comparing word to word
[1:04:29] by steady it takes an operation of the
[1:04:33] Holy Ghost you with me anybody here you
[1:04:37] know my probably every one of you on
[1:04:38] your phones and tablets you've got that
[1:04:40] message search anybody can punch in a
[1:04:42] word anybody can search anything now
[1:04:44] it's not about having the words all laid
[1:04:47] out it's about having the revelation of
[1:04:50] who it is that has visited and with us
[1:04:53] in this hour it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:56] we were not introduced to Elijah we were
[1:04:58] introduced by Elijah to the Lord Jesus
[1:05:01] Christ we were brought together in a
[1:05:03] union I'm afraid many times many people
[1:05:07] have fallen in love with Elijah and not
[1:05:09] the Lord Jesus Christ what and where
[1:05:11] we're going here but we'll just go I'm
[1:05:14] afraid that it's turned to that where
[1:05:16] they're in love with him and it's
[1:05:17] idolatry instead of being in love with
[1:05:19] the Lord Jesus Christ there's one
[1:05:22] infallible one in our midst and that's
[1:05:25] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:26] he's the worm that the prophet exalted
[1:05:29] in this hour he is the mighty angel that
[1:05:32] has come down in this time in this hour
[1:05:34] to take four seals off of himself he is
[1:05:38] the one working in our midst and in our
[1:05:41] lives though it could be misunderstood
[1:05:45] miscued but you know you know and whom
[1:05:49] you have believed a man in the midst of
[1:05:53] a time of discouragement and what seemed
[1:05:55] to be where all hope was gone
[1:05:58] but yet the word was being fulfilled I'm
[1:06:01] glad I'm a witness to that verse things
[1:06:05] that have been fulfilled I wasn't even
[1:06:07] aware of it hey there's times when
[1:06:09] healing has struck my body I wasn't even
[1:06:11] aware of it same thing for you as well
[1:06:14] are you with me even when a woman how
[1:06:17] many times brother Branham gives the
[1:06:18] example Oh sister you didn't think you
[1:06:20] had enough faith to be healed he said
[1:06:22] that you were healed moments ago but it
[1:06:25] was something that passed by the
[1:06:27] observation of the natural mind because
[1:06:28] faith is not something of an intellect
[1:06:31] faith is a
[1:06:32] conscious something it takes a whole
[1:06:34] there's a divine communication going on
[1:06:36] and then things will take place and be
[1:06:38] fulfilled and then after a while you
[1:06:40] realize oh my goodness this is gone it's
[1:06:42] just like with something that you can be
[1:06:44] dealing with battling with in your life
[1:06:46] there's something you're desiring Lord
[1:06:48] God give me that overcoming Grace and
[1:06:50] strength the Lord God help me Lord God
[1:06:52] in the midst of this temptation and
[1:06:54] you'll find yourself in a time that all
[1:06:56] of a sudden here it comes about and you
[1:06:58] realize God will allow that temptation
[1:07:01] to come by your way again and you
[1:07:03] realize there is an authority that has
[1:07:05] moved in in that area of your life and
[1:07:08] what is that God allowed the temptation
[1:07:10] to come around to testify of his power
[1:07:14] and authority gaining preeminence in our
[1:07:16] life what does it do it drives away
[1:07:19] discouragement so here this temporary
[1:07:22] and I'll say like that
[1:07:23] temporary impediment of a stumbling
[1:07:27] block in the disciples it was just
[1:07:30] something that was temporary I say it
[1:07:32] like this the events that had transpired
[1:07:34] they couldn't understand it but they
[1:07:37] were not unbelievers they were not make
[1:07:42] believers it was it was pressure of the
[1:07:47] time and of the hour and they didn't
[1:07:50] understand what was going on now you
[1:07:52] look at many there were many who walked
[1:07:55] away and I'll get to that in a moment
[1:07:56] but you see they were believers the
[1:07:59] events that had taken place it just
[1:08:01] hasn't been revealed to him now you know
[1:08:03] that brings us to this place as we said
[1:08:06] last week that God will reveal to you
[1:08:08] and I what we have need of it what we
[1:08:11] have need of when we need it you know
[1:08:15] what that brings that don't bring
[1:08:16] laziness that brings a rest
[1:08:19] don't confuse laziness with rest it's
[1:08:22] not the same thing
[1:08:22] rest is where you're in tune with God
[1:08:25] and you're just walking step by step
[1:08:27] with him it's not you trying to work
[1:08:29] something up and I've got to do this and
[1:08:31] I've got to do so much this I've got to
[1:08:33] do so much that you're causing yourself
[1:08:35] to be in such a tight place God can't
[1:08:37] even speak to you these ain't my words
[1:08:41] questions and answers 54 the Prophet
[1:08:44] tells us with yielding he said some
[1:08:45] times we forget how you yield it and
[1:08:48] come right down the aisle when the
[1:08:50] Spirit of God had spoke to your life and
[1:08:52] you just simply yield it he said we need
[1:08:55] to get out of this so much pressing and
[1:08:57] studying and trying to press in he said
[1:08:59] you need to fall back in love with the
[1:09:01] Lord Jesus Christ that's what it is a
[1:09:03] love affair it's falling in love with
[1:09:06] him and allowing just to speak to you
[1:09:08] allowing just to talk to you let me tell
[1:09:10] you something friends you've heard me
[1:09:11] say this over and over I had God it
[1:09:13] ain't when all of a sudden I sit down in
[1:09:15] a computer and God starts speaking to me
[1:09:17] a matter of fact there's many notes and
[1:09:18] things that wrote out throughout the
[1:09:20] time things dropping and things you'll
[1:09:22] just inspire when maybe I'm riding in
[1:09:24] the car or going here and there because
[1:09:26] let me tell you something the computer
[1:09:27] don't put a message together you can
[1:09:30] have a computer you can do all the
[1:09:32] searches you want that don't put a
[1:09:33] message together a message itself ain't
[1:09:36] about a search where you just do a group
[1:09:38] of words and search things out well I'm
[1:09:42] gonna preach sometimes there's been the
[1:09:44] things that's been put out there books
[1:09:45] that's full and they type in one word
[1:09:47] and print all these quotes and say look
[1:09:49] at all these quotes but there's got to
[1:09:51] be a dividing of those things there
[1:09:53] needs to be a discerning of what said
[1:09:55] sometimes you have situations and things
[1:09:57] within there it's not enough just
[1:09:59] printing out a whole section and a whole
[1:10:01] document about this
[1:10:02] that's not ministering of the word
[1:10:04] that's not leading of the Lord that's
[1:10:06] just simply knowing how to spell a word
[1:10:08] hoping the computer corrects it and then
[1:10:10] you have a whole tag of quotes but
[1:10:12] there's only one who can really reveal
[1:10:14] it and that is the Holy Spirit he
[1:10:16] ministers to you and I just what we have
[1:10:19] need of it and I'll tell you what's the
[1:10:20] truth he's the one I want to follow I'm
[1:10:22] not interested in what anybody else
[1:10:24] thinks I'll to preach I think you ought
[1:10:25] to do this I think you ought to do this
[1:10:26] I'll just follow him the one I've been
[1:10:29] following because he knows what we have
[1:10:32] need of I'm glad about that what's this
[1:10:37] the Lord Jesus now remember they've
[1:10:39] testified now it's the Christ the
[1:10:41] Messiah now watch this in John 17 here
[1:10:44] at the Lord Jesus in an intercessory
[1:10:46] prayer look I looked the declaration
[1:10:48] that he has been able to identify about
[1:10:51] the Lord Jesus I have manifested thy
[1:10:53] name unto the men which thou gave us me
[1:10:55] out of the world then they were thou
[1:10:58] gave us their me and they have kept that
[1:11:00] word now they have no look at this they
[1:11:04] have known that all things whatsoever
[1:11:06] thou have given me are of V you know
[1:11:10] this was an important part the Bible
[1:11:12] says in Hebrews 11 it says he that
[1:11:15] cometh to God must first believe that he
[1:11:18] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:11:22] that diligently seek you you see that's
[1:11:24] why it cannot be a church
[1:11:26] it cannot be an idea it cannot be
[1:11:28] doctrines friends it's got to be the
[1:11:30] Lord Jesus Christ that's set before the
[1:11:32] people I am persuaded that many times
[1:11:34] it's just been the message by doctrines
[1:11:37] that's been put before people and people
[1:11:39] have ascribed to doctrines they can put
[1:11:41] doctors together but remember Judas had
[1:11:44] and shared understanding in all the
[1:11:47] mysteries but what Judas lacked was the
[1:11:49] divine revelation of who Jesus really
[1:11:52] was Hey look Peter didn't have the Holy
[1:11:57] Ghost either the rest of them didn't
[1:12:01] have the Holy Ghost either but Jesus
[1:12:03] when he said all of you are gonna be
[1:12:05] offended me in this night Judas was no
[1:12:07] longer in the company because what he
[1:12:10] said I'll smite the Shepherd and the
[1:12:12] Sheep these were sheep he was talking to
[1:12:15] the sheep were going to be scattered one
[1:12:17] goats these were sheep that was going to
[1:12:19] be scattered not to think of this how
[1:12:21] this revelation would so strike within
[1:12:23] the hearts of the believers of here as
[1:12:26] Jesus himself is praying in verse eight
[1:12:28] he goes on to say for I have given unto
[1:12:30] them the words which thou gave us me and
[1:12:33] they have received them and have known
[1:12:37] surely that I came out from thee and
[1:12:40] they have believed that thou did a send
[1:12:43] me are you asleep
[1:12:46] they believed you say well Peter denied
[1:12:50] him three times but he believed he knew
[1:12:53] surely but you see where it's at right
[1:12:55] now where was it that Peter believed
[1:12:57] right here there was a seed on the
[1:12:59] inside that was identifying now at the
[1:13:02] Christ now at the Son of the Living God
[1:13:04] you see it had been revealed and open to
[1:13:06] them that indeed he was the Christ this
[1:13:08] was the very son of
[1:13:10] but yet as far as by a personal
[1:13:13] experience and a typos it could not be
[1:13:15] revealed at that time because the
[1:13:17] sacrifice had not been offered up and
[1:13:19] then moved into the mediatorial place it
[1:13:21] could not be revealed in that time
[1:13:23] within Peters life but yet to see within
[1:13:25] it it shows that intellectual faith is
[1:13:28] not enough Peter himself noticed the
[1:13:31] Bible says in the book of Mark that even
[1:13:33] when Peter it records these times when
[1:13:36] he said I'll never be offended in you
[1:13:38] and the Bible says he pressed on the
[1:13:40] Lord Jesus vehemently as did the rest of
[1:13:43] the disciples in their best efforts they
[1:13:45] said I'm gonna do this I'm gonna stay
[1:13:48] with you there is nobody gonna get me
[1:13:50] away from you
[1:13:51] they meant that friends they really
[1:13:53] meant it but you know what it was they
[1:13:54] did not have sufficient power to be able
[1:13:57] to laugh it up to back it up you see
[1:13:59] this is where a real absolute comes into
[1:14:02] play a real experience comes into play
[1:14:04] brother Branham takes that example with
[1:14:06] Peter he said you see he said if it's
[1:14:08] really not an acre within your life the
[1:14:10] first little discouragement that comes
[1:14:13] up in the church out you go
[1:14:15] a first sermon rent is like this again
[1:14:17] the first little trial not big trial
[1:14:19] little trial little discouragement comes
[1:14:21] up out you go out I tell you this has
[1:14:24] happened and this has taken place and
[1:14:26] whatever more but don't get caught up on
[1:14:27] all the distractions you're gonna always
[1:14:29] see all types of distractions here we
[1:14:32] are gathered together as a body and a
[1:14:34] group of believers and let me tell you
[1:14:35] something God has a divine promise that
[1:14:38] there is an elect of God that comes into
[1:14:41] the revelation of the word that will
[1:14:43] submit to that word and walk in that
[1:14:45] light and you see when we see this right
[1:14:47] here
[1:14:48] with Peter and with the rest of them
[1:14:50] they had an ability they could actually
[1:14:52] look and say thou art the Christ then
[1:14:54] indeed art the Son of man they could
[1:14:56] look at that and see it but they didn't
[1:14:57] have authority to be able to stand there
[1:15:00] within that hour that's what's important
[1:15:03] not that you know all the doctrines they
[1:15:12] believed you see
[1:15:15] this is why the disciples could preach
[1:15:18] the way they preached and knew that you
[1:15:21] first had to believe but they also
[1:15:24] preached it that believing is not you
[1:15:26] being born again they knew it by
[1:15:30] experience they didn't go to seminary
[1:15:34] come on somebody they didn't go to
[1:15:36] seminary it wasn't some guy out there
[1:15:38] teaching them out here's what you do to
[1:15:40] people
[1:15:40] you teach them like this this was not it
[1:15:42] was God Himself teaching them and they
[1:15:46] could come right back to this
[1:15:48] they knew they believed and they knew
[1:15:50] the power of belief the power of belief
[1:15:52] actually drew them away from fishing
[1:15:55] nets tax-collecting it drew them away
[1:15:57] but yet believing itself did not make
[1:16:00] them one with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:03] they even had disunity disagreements
[1:16:06] among themselves they were not unified
[1:16:08] with Jesus yet Jesus himself was unified
[1:16:11] with them but after Pentecost different
[1:16:14] story
[1:16:14] brother and sister like this he said it
[1:16:16] was no longer Peter in the front leading
[1:16:18] it was Christ in the front Peter in the
[1:16:21] back don't you love that think of this
[1:16:26] these people of how these disciples were
[1:16:28] in this hour they you know brother man
[1:16:31] tells us like this and a message to
[1:16:33] Lohmann maybe I just you know we refer
[1:16:35] to instead of reading it but he said of
[1:16:37] how that they themselves they knew who
[1:16:40] he was they understood that part of it
[1:16:42] like we read and the Lord Jesus
[1:16:44] acknowledged that here and they said
[1:16:46] we're sure of that you see they had bad
[1:16:49] ground that they could stand on we're
[1:16:51] sure of that but there were other things
[1:16:53] as far as the trial the affliction the
[1:16:57] suffering and the third day but they
[1:16:59] didn't understand that but there was
[1:17:01] things that they did understand you see
[1:17:04] it wasn't important that they understood
[1:17:06] the suffering the trials and all that it
[1:17:09] wasn't that they were we Christians
[1:17:10] brother let me tell you something it
[1:17:12] wasn't that they didn't know Scripture
[1:17:14] they knew Scripture but it took the lawn
[1:17:17] who the scripture spoke of to actually
[1:17:20] come in the midst of their heart to
[1:17:22] where that there was no longer something
[1:17:24] they were quoting but it was a
[1:17:25] redemptive experience in
[1:17:28] their life that they themselves were a
[1:17:29] part of that prophecy by divine
[1:17:32] experience and you see they didn't
[1:17:35] understand it but they did have an
[1:17:36] understanding to know who he is you know
[1:17:38] there's a lot of things of times in our
[1:17:40] life where you don't understand this
[1:17:42] that or this or that and know how
[1:17:44] certain things are gonna unfold and if
[1:17:46] you say you do I'm gonna call you liar
[1:17:48] you don't understand how things are
[1:17:50] gonna unfold you only understand as God
[1:17:52] opens it to your understanding and
[1:17:54] unfolds your understanding to it you see
[1:17:58] the only thing we can do is walk in
[1:18:00] obedience as the light itself is open to
[1:18:03] you and I the Bible says that the light
[1:18:05] itself is a path to the jeff's it also
[1:18:07] says that it in the book of Proverbs it
[1:18:09] continues to open and become more
[1:18:11] brighter and clearer under that perfect
[1:18:13] day you know don't worry about the
[1:18:15] things that you don't understand it's
[1:18:17] like sometimes you can have people that
[1:18:18] come right in here and some of you may
[1:18:20] you come and maybe you've been here for
[1:18:22] a month maybe two maybe a few years and
[1:18:24] you look at things and I'd say like this
[1:18:26] people that's been around even the
[1:18:27] message because I don't understand
[1:18:29] everything you know what me start
[1:18:32] quoting what the prophetess said to you
[1:18:34] he said I don't understand how Jesus and
[1:18:37] the Father he said can be worn and to
[1:18:39] lean not to your own understanding I
[1:18:41] don't understand it but I believe it I
[1:18:44] know it to be true I believe it so you
[1:18:47] see it's not about understanding because
[1:18:48] remember anything that we can understand
[1:18:51] here and perfectly explained it's no
[1:18:54] longer faith it's no longer faith that
[1:18:57] doesn't mean that we're walking around
[1:18:58] stumbling in the dark that's not what
[1:19:00] faith is faith is a divine revelation
[1:19:03] sovereignly given by God but remember
[1:19:07] whatever has been revealed the Prophet
[1:19:09] himself will mention this in the first
[1:19:11] seal picks it out of the Scofield Bible
[1:19:12] by the way that when a mystery has been
[1:19:14] revealed even though it's been revealed
[1:19:16] that remains a supernatural element to
[1:19:19] it why because it's not something that
[1:19:21] can be explained it's something that
[1:19:23] still remains there as a supernatural
[1:19:26] element I'm glad about that aren't you
[1:19:28] it's something that just you realize
[1:19:30] it's supernatural
[1:19:31] it's not been man given so to think how
[1:19:33] here they are they're walking in
[1:19:35] obedience to the word then that's what
[1:19:37] Jesus testified up the Bible tells us in
[1:19:40] this text right here in Luke 2
[1:19:41] for that when they could identify have
[1:19:44] you not heard of him he was a prophet
[1:19:46] mighty in word and deed you see they
[1:19:48] recognized that he indeed he was a
[1:19:50] prophet mighty in word indeed but they
[1:19:53] didn't recognize him to be the Redeemer
[1:19:55] prophet they didn't see it in that life
[1:19:58] although they were in hope and for that
[1:20:00] they were trusting in that so you see
[1:20:02] the veil of their understanding as far
[1:20:05] as to know that indeed that this indeed
[1:20:07] was the Son of God that veil itself had
[1:20:09] began to lift from their life but yet it
[1:20:12] had not fully come open to them and this
[1:20:14] is why they're in a state of
[1:20:16] discouragement and disappointment and
[1:20:18] let down the brother let me tell you
[1:20:19] when the rail itself is lifted that's
[1:20:22] when discouragement that's when
[1:20:24] disheartened man
[1:20:25] that's when sadness is broken that's
[1:20:27] when gloom you know why because when
[1:20:29] this and when he was there laying in
[1:20:32] that tomb there those three days and
[1:20:34] nights but when he got up on that Easter
[1:20:36] morning there was a rising of the Sun
[1:20:39] brother it was not just the sunrise
[1:20:41] there there was a Sun rising from the
[1:20:43] grave it was a testimony there a price
[1:20:46] has been paid debt has been defeated
[1:20:49] grave has been defeated hail has been
[1:20:51] defeated it was a testimony there's more
[1:20:54] sons that's going to be rising
[1:20:58] hey man bro repeater God so to think of
[1:21:02] this how that the work yet the veil of
[1:21:05] the work of the Redeemer in Redemption
[1:21:07] was veiled because the Redeemer had to
[1:21:10] fulfill it remember it wasn't their cup
[1:21:13] to drink Peter tried to stop the Lord
[1:21:17] Jesus don't even not only taking off the
[1:21:21] year of that of that regard that came
[1:21:24] but remember how many times the Lord
[1:21:26] Jesus or Peter himself rebuked him and
[1:21:29] the Lord Jesus said get behind me Satan
[1:21:32] thou savourest not the things that be of
[1:21:34] God but rather the things that be of man
[1:21:36] they did not understand the suffering
[1:21:39] that was come they did not understand
[1:21:41] that but to see that this veil it would
[1:21:43] eventually be lifted for them that they
[1:21:46] could Missy it manifested and later in
[1:21:49] them manifested and through their lives
[1:21:52] manifest
[1:21:52] remember the Lord Jesus said in Matthew
[1:21:55] 26 verse 32 he promised him well after
[1:21:58] he had spoken about the offence he said
[1:22:00] but after that I'm risen again I will go
[1:22:04] before you into Galilee you see the
[1:22:08] sheep were scattered but the Shepherd's
[1:22:10] going to rise the same shepherd who
[1:22:13] spoke in John 10 and said my sheep know
[1:22:16] my voice and I'm known of them he
[1:22:18] identified himself as the door the place
[1:22:20] of entry the way and he says that I'm
[1:22:23] that I lay the shepherd lay my life down
[1:22:25] for the Sheep and here he is as the
[1:22:28] shepherd a scattered sheep sheep that
[1:22:31] are all scattered they had been all
[1:22:32] brought together around the promise
[1:22:34] there in the Messiah but because things
[1:22:36] were not happening as they thought and
[1:22:39] prophecy had to be fulfilled they had to
[1:22:43] be scattered at that time but as he
[1:22:47] promised
[1:22:48] after I'm risen I will go before you
[1:22:53] home ha I love this word go before it
[1:22:55] means to lead forward lead forth one
[1:22:58] from a place in which he has lain hidden
[1:23:01] from view will now go before he was
[1:23:06] there with him the whole time but yet
[1:23:09] this part of the journey was hidden from
[1:23:11] him it was hidden but now he Rises and
[1:23:16] he's going to go before now think of
[1:23:19] this how did he lead them before did he
[1:23:23] lead him by Suns and miracles signs and
[1:23:25] miracles accompanied him and it also was
[1:23:28] that of God saying I've approved him but
[1:23:30] it wasn't just signs and miracles it was
[1:23:33] word he led them by the word you see you
[1:23:36] can't separate the word from the Spirit
[1:23:38] if you can separate the word from the
[1:23:40] Spirit then you no longer have true
[1:23:42] worshipers but a true worshiper who's
[1:23:44] one who worships in spirit and in truth
[1:23:47] that the word itself is not a letter but
[1:23:50] the word itself is the living person of
[1:23:52] the Lord Jesus Christ that actually
[1:23:54] speaks to our hearts and our lives and
[1:23:56] discerns the varying things that you and
[1:23:58] I have need of it's actually the word
[1:24:01] itself when the Spirit of God gets ahold
[1:24:03] of that word he can open that
[1:24:05] as it's been laying there and then what
[1:24:07] you begin to see is the program of God
[1:24:10] that lays beneath that capstone or that
[1:24:12] part of the word that has now been
[1:24:14] brought out and as he opens it up the
[1:24:16] program of God begins to unfold you see
[1:24:19] you can just quote like many look the
[1:24:21] rabbis even they that were singing the
[1:24:23] Psalms they sung the Psalms but
[1:24:25] underneath that Psalm there was
[1:24:27] something to be unfolded when in my God
[1:24:29] my God why has thou forsaken me and yet
[1:24:31] here they were singing that down in the
[1:24:33] temple but yet there was a real
[1:24:35] fulfillment that was going on out there
[1:24:37] at Calvary what was not what was here as
[1:24:40] a mercy seat that was only a type out
[1:24:42] here at Calvary the real mercy seat was
[1:24:45] actually coming into view out there at
[1:24:47] Calvary they were singing words and all
[1:24:49] these things that pertain to it they
[1:24:51] were quoting of what Moses had said and
[1:24:53] what David had said but you see the
[1:24:55] program of God is what laid beneath that
[1:24:58] word to wear when that word was opened
[1:25:00] up to them it would pour out the
[1:25:02] blessing and the virtue and the strength
[1:25:04] of all that was contained in it let me
[1:25:06] just say this morning the Word of God is
[1:25:08] not a letter but the Word of God is a
[1:25:11] living person and when that word is
[1:25:13] revealed it packs within it sufficient
[1:25:15] virtue sufficient power my brother and
[1:25:18] sister it's the same Spirit of God that
[1:25:20] takes ahold of that word and begins to
[1:25:22] manifest that word in power in our lives
[1:25:27] hallelujah he executes his divine
[1:25:30] authority as he takes his word and by
[1:25:33] his word becoming flesh then he himself
[1:25:35] he asserts himself over the very
[1:25:38] authority and kingdom of darkness Oh
[1:25:41] mom's so glad that that word itself it
[1:25:44] is the Lord Jesus Christ it dispels down
[1:25:48] it dispels these things no Sam you're
[1:25:54] not what a compliment
[1:26:02] John 1336 here Peter said unto Him Lord
[1:26:08] whether goes them here's another account
[1:26:11] of where the Lord Jesus talking about
[1:26:13] the offense jesus answered him and said
[1:26:16] whether I go thou canst not follow me
[1:26:21] now but thou shalt follow me afterwards
[1:26:29] why because I've got to be able to bring
[1:26:33] you from where you are to where you need
[1:26:35] to be a man he was the Keystone the
[1:26:39] breach they men that would hear about a
[1:26:43] holy God
[1:26:44] he could put his hand on a sinful man
[1:26:47] than a holy God he indeed is that
[1:26:49] mediator among man by the man Christ
[1:26:52] Jesus you can't follow me now you can't
[1:26:55] do this kinsman walk Ruth but I'm gonna
[1:26:58] do it for you afterwards you'll follow
[1:27:03] me now you can't but afterwards you will
[1:27:10] Peter said unto Him Lord why Kent cannot
[1:27:16] I follow thee now boy and Moz will be
[1:27:21] honest were a lot like Peter I'll go to
[1:27:25] Samuel I've been born again get that
[1:27:27] self-righteous thing down you still ask
[1:27:30] the question why sometimes I know you
[1:27:34] may not say it out here but sometimes
[1:27:35] you wonder I don't have to go through
[1:27:43] examples in the scripture do I and go in
[1:27:46] through the prophets life himself when
[1:27:47] something did not happen the way he
[1:27:49] wanted and that woman who ended up
[1:27:50] passing away from uremic poisoning and
[1:27:52] what did he do counted on God and gone
[1:27:57] here's what the prophet this is
[1:27:58] testimony
[1:27:58] it's his testimony you know what he said
[1:28:01] he said God let me pout that way and sit
[1:28:03] there because I've told him you owe me
[1:28:05] an answer
[1:28:06] God don't owe us nothing
[1:28:08] I don't care who we are God don't owe us
[1:28:10] nothing I'm glad those examples are
[1:28:13] included in there because you know what
[1:28:16] it seemed like is she should have been
[1:28:18] here why did why did all this take place
[1:28:20] and she's not made well that would have
[1:28:22] been discouraging that was disappointing
[1:28:23] but you see it didn't cause the proper
[1:28:26] to say I don't believe in God no more
[1:28:27] that's not what it was it was he did not
[1:28:30] understand but see in the wrong humor
[1:28:32] you owe me an explanation God don't know
[1:28:34] him an explanation but God allowed it to
[1:28:36] be an lesson that we don't question the
[1:28:38] ways of the Lord there's a lot of things
[1:28:41] that's taken place there's people that's
[1:28:43] been taken home we would say prematurely
[1:28:45] young of age and it's not explainable
[1:28:48] why did they pass such a young person
[1:28:49] why did they pass maybe they were 50
[1:28:51] years old still a young person and you
[1:28:52] say why in the world sells so much ahead
[1:28:54] of them why did that God knows God knows
[1:28:57] he has it all in his hand do we grief we
[1:29:00] do grief do we sorrow yes we do do we
[1:29:02] miss I'm sure we do but yet within it
[1:29:05] all as a believer we come back to say
[1:29:07] Lord you do all things well and I rest
[1:29:11] within that well that's a great help
[1:29:15] I'll tell you what in the time of
[1:29:16] trouble is to be able to just say Lord
[1:29:18] you do all things well amen so here the
[1:29:22] Lord Jesus he's let him know you'll fall
[1:29:25] you can't follow me now but you shall
[1:29:27] follow me so here the question of love
[1:29:30] why but you notice I want to just deal
[1:29:32] with this thought on the offended
[1:29:34] because you see it's quite a contrast as
[1:29:37] you look in the scriptures the same word
[1:29:39] which is our English word scandalized
[1:29:43] which is what that word offended means
[1:29:44] it's mentioned throughout the scriptures
[1:29:47] and you'll find it aware that the
[1:29:49] Pharisees and others were offended in
[1:29:52] the Lord Jesus they were offended at
[1:29:54] John the Baptist they were offended at
[1:29:57] many others and it was a stumbling block
[1:29:59] it was an impediment it was something
[1:30:02] that where they themselves were not able
[1:30:04] and did not see and recognize even the
[1:30:07] part that had been opened at that time
[1:30:09] they did not recognize John the Baptist
[1:30:12] they did not recognize the Lord Jesus as
[1:30:14] a matter of fact Peter would pick up
[1:30:16] this same thought picking it back from
[1:30:18] the Book of Psalms and pulling it
[1:30:20] forward on
[1:30:21] about that headstone that that which was
[1:30:23] the chief of the corner he has also made
[1:30:25] the head and this is this is the Lord's
[1:30:26] doing it's marvelous in our own eye in
[1:30:28] our eyes or his eyes and to see how that
[1:30:31] reader would take this up and he would
[1:30:33] talk about this stumbling stone a rock
[1:30:35] of offence and Peter would speak of it
[1:30:37] that those who stumble are those who are
[1:30:39] disobedient and the disobedient are
[1:30:42] those who will not submit to that word
[1:30:44] and submit to that Authority now we
[1:30:46] could go on into that rock and go on
[1:30:47] into there all of those things are
[1:30:49] Daniel but we're just going to stay
[1:30:50] right here within this that there is a
[1:30:52] disobedience which these disciples were
[1:30:55] not disobedient to the word they were
[1:30:57] walking in all that had been open to
[1:31:01] them now let me just pause and preach
[1:31:03] for a little bit let me preach one
[1:31:04] preacher when you look at this here for
[1:31:06] a moment you'll see what's very
[1:31:07] important friends is that you walk in
[1:31:10] all that God has revealed but you need
[1:31:12] to have a heart and it must be a hunger
[1:31:14] that Lord I want to know you more that
[1:31:17] ought to be something within your heart
[1:31:19] that you're longing to know him more
[1:31:20] listen don't don't feel bad but there's
[1:31:23] certain things that you look at and say
[1:31:24] I can't explain this or I can't put this
[1:31:27] together I'll tell you what you just
[1:31:29] pray about that and you watch God not
[1:31:31] bring it right across here
[1:31:32] God might open it up as you're listening
[1:31:34] to a message you'll find yourself maybe
[1:31:36] reading through the scriptures you let
[1:31:38] it be a personal witness because what
[1:31:40] however it comes whatever Avenue it's
[1:31:42] going to be called that gets the glory
[1:31:44] it'll be him that open your
[1:31:45] understanding it would just be a
[1:31:47] personal experience between you and him
[1:31:49] so revelation is always important let me
[1:31:52] tell you something it's not enough just
[1:31:53] to come and sit in this church and just
[1:31:56] to know that God sent a prophet you can
[1:31:59] know that and go straight to hell I'm
[1:32:02] being flattening that's being straight
[1:32:04] but they've got to be honest you can
[1:32:06] know that and you still be full of the
[1:32:08] love of the world in your life yet ain't
[1:32:11] enough it's turn recognize and recognize
[1:32:14] the Lord Jesus Christ because a message
[1:32:17] itself and never took us away from the
[1:32:20] whole thrust of the gospel and that is
[1:32:24] Redemption
[1:32:25] it's redemption of the soul that leads
[1:32:27] to redemption of the body the gospel
[1:32:31] mess
[1:32:31] it has never changed you say well this
[1:32:36] hour this message that we've received
[1:32:37] hold on a moment this message points you
[1:32:40] and I to the real true experience of the
[1:32:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost the way that
[1:32:45] the Apostles believed it the way they
[1:32:47] believed predestination this message is
[1:32:50] not something new that dropped out of
[1:32:52] the sky it is an assembly of truth that
[1:32:56] already laid here Elad you never patent
[1:33:01] those stones up to Mount Carmel you with
[1:33:04] me
[1:33:04] he didn't tap those stones up there
[1:33:06] their stones were already there there
[1:33:09] are fragments of truth that had been
[1:33:11] scattered down through the ages and
[1:33:15] Elijah wasn't saying I think this rock
[1:33:17] looks good I think this rock look to it
[1:33:19] and you know what now check this one out
[1:33:20] let's get that one there were stones
[1:33:22] that were already there that when they
[1:33:25] would be assembled under the word of the
[1:33:28] Lord it would be that which would usher
[1:33:30] in the very presence of God and would
[1:33:33] make himself known to Israel that I'm
[1:33:36] the same God that the same one that
[1:33:38] brought out of Egypt the same one that
[1:33:40] rescued you the same one the new your
[1:33:42] father Abraham I'm the same God I'm the
[1:33:45] God of Israel he would make himself know
[1:33:50] by assembling truth and coming down on
[1:33:53] it
[1:33:58] hi Gloria and I'm a person of truth how
[1:34:02] about you quite the contrast of the
[1:34:08] offense well we could really deal with
[1:34:15] this there were those disciples in that
[1:34:18] time in John eight they believed on him
[1:34:23] they believed many believed or what did
[1:34:29] Jesus say if you continue in my word
[1:34:31] then are you my disciples indeed it's a
[1:34:38] continuing on in the word I believe
[1:34:40] that's what the Holy Spirit was
[1:34:42] expressing to us it's a continuing on in
[1:34:44] the word you can't live off of something
[1:34:48] in the past
[1:34:49] you can't live listen to me so we're
[1:34:51] both Sam you talked about a sacred Sandt
[1:34:53] sacred sands friends is a place where
[1:34:55] you have met God face to face and
[1:34:57] there's been a change in your life that
[1:34:59] is something you always carry with you
[1:35:01] but you cannot just live listen what
[1:35:04] good would it do for you to talk about a
[1:35:06] fire that you only experienced 10 years
[1:35:09] ago five years ago and you don't have
[1:35:10] that same fire tonight what's wrong
[1:35:14] where did the fire fall did it fall just
[1:35:17] on your flesh did it fall just in your
[1:35:19] spirit or did it fall in your soul
[1:35:22] because of it falls in your soul it
[1:35:25] cannot be contaminated
[1:35:26] the manna that fell on the flesh
[1:35:28] contaminated the manner the fellow the
[1:35:31] spirit contaminated but the manner that
[1:35:33] fell in the cell whether they know
[1:35:34] maggots got to that that experience was
[1:35:37] the same as it was on the first day that
[1:35:39] it failed can you get down and
[1:35:41] discourage you can but you need to
[1:35:43] recognize and realize if there's a
[1:35:45] hunger in your heart you can be like
[1:35:47] David and say restore unto me the joy of
[1:35:51] thy salvation
[1:35:54] and renew a right spirit in me
[1:36:05] so those people think the same you're
[1:36:08] trying to get her back sign it I'm
[1:36:09] trying to get nobody excited I want you
[1:36:11] to have joy in your life if you kind of
[1:36:17] if you'd go by some people you'd look at
[1:36:19] it others good looks at men I don't want
[1:36:20] what you got
[1:36:21] I might make you a good moral person but
[1:36:25] it don't seem legal no joy joy and
[1:36:30] fictitious
[1:36:31] the joy of the Lord is our strength he
[1:36:36] paid the price he prayed in the prayer
[1:36:38] of intercessory that they might have
[1:36:40] this joy fulfilled in themselves that's
[1:36:43] what Jesus said I've come that you might
[1:36:45] have life and have it more abundantly
[1:36:47] he did not come to give a bunch of
[1:36:49] regulations and a bunch of rules he came
[1:36:52] to write backward down in the depths of
[1:36:55] our heart to where it's not a regulation
[1:36:57] just out here but it's an inward
[1:37:00] dwelling that shows itself from the
[1:37:02] inside to the outside that's why when he
[1:37:06] became flesh they didn't think they
[1:37:08] needed a baby but God gave them what
[1:37:10] they needed they needed to be a birth
[1:37:13] come in order that you and I could come
[1:37:16] to a real birth to be to God who others
[1:37:23] throughout the ministry walked away from
[1:37:24] him I would understand this is that
[1:37:28] right these disciples didn't understand
[1:37:30] a lot of things they do understand but
[1:37:33] you find many of the disciples they've
[1:37:34] many different ones that were walking
[1:37:35] with him they said this is too hard to
[1:37:38] understand man who can understand this
[1:37:40] this is way too much you know that even
[1:37:44] happened with Paul Peter even said that
[1:37:47] at the end of 2nd Peter that there were
[1:37:50] many who already unlearned who rest soul
[1:37:53] with those scriptures to their own
[1:37:58] destruction you know what Peter had to
[1:38:00] say Peter had to say about the
[1:38:02] inspiration that Paul was given by God
[1:38:04] that wasn't even wrote in the scriptures
[1:38:06] your honor he had to say about it he
[1:38:09] called it Scripture Paul called it the
[1:38:12] commandments of God
[1:38:14] and the elect said amen glory be to God
[1:38:19] you see whom the disciples they weren't
[1:38:22] rejecting him but they were indeed
[1:38:24] disciples indeed now let's just try to
[1:38:26] you know bring this on down here so
[1:38:29] we're about altitude we hadn't even
[1:38:32] started to dip yet but your little glass
[1:38:37] of water get ready to finish that finish
[1:38:40] off your packet of pretzels we'll be
[1:38:42] coming into a landing the Bible picks
[1:38:48] this up you know in the book of Acts
[1:38:49] chapter 1 he talks about how if let me
[1:38:53] just kind of read over not reading it
[1:38:54] word for word but he stayed with them
[1:38:57] for 40 days this is the Shepherd leading
[1:39:03] the Sheep did they already have the word
[1:39:06] concerning what was going to happen yes
[1:39:09] but it wasn't unfolded to them you see
[1:39:15] they were rejoicing in the resurrection
[1:39:17] now which is a wonderful thing but and
[1:39:19] they had to see what does this mean to
[1:39:23] me and that's something how that the
[1:39:26] Prophet himself would take that in the
[1:39:28] rising of the Sun he said but what has
[1:39:30] that got to do with me
[1:39:31] you see that's a question that must be
[1:39:34] asked and there must be an answer to it
[1:39:37] for what he did he did it for a reason
[1:39:40] so to think of this the Bible says that
[1:39:43] after he through the Holy Ghost had
[1:39:45] given them Commandments unto the
[1:39:47] Apostles whom he had chosen this he was
[1:39:50] speaking to those whom he had chosen the
[1:39:53] Bible said he showed himself in verse 3
[1:39:55] of x1 he showed himself alive after his
[1:39:58] suffering his passion by many infallible
[1:40:01] proofs what were the infallible proofs
[1:40:03] that he did the same thing that he did
[1:40:04] before if he ever healed the sick before
[1:40:07] he's the same God if he ever delivered
[1:40:10] before he's the same God he made himself
[1:40:13] known that he's the same he didn't
[1:40:16] change in essence didn't change the
[1:40:18] nature he didn't change in power as a
[1:40:20] matter of fact he gained in power
[1:40:22] because he said all power in heaven and
[1:40:25] it's given unto me oh my one time were
[1:40:29] the heavens it's shut off but now the
[1:40:32] heavens were opened
[1:40:34] hey man every demon power not only death
[1:40:38] hell and the grave but every demon power
[1:40:40] everyone that had contaminated the
[1:40:43] atmospheres he now had ascended up how
[1:40:46] did he ascends up that obedience to the
[1:40:49] Word of God in a submissive heart they
[1:40:51] weren't enough Devils to keep him there
[1:40:55] you see the power of obedience friends
[1:40:58] obedience sets you free your the words
[1:41:01] going forth and you and your heart can
[1:41:03] just submit in your heart and say that's
[1:41:05] nothing but the truth
[1:41:07] a man Lord you know what it'll turn his
[1:41:11] attention you may not need a room this
[1:41:13] morning but you need the manifestation
[1:41:16] of the RAM of Almighty God
[1:41:18] maybe it's healing in your body maybe
[1:41:20] it's deliverance maybe it's the Holy
[1:41:22] Ghost
[1:41:23] maybe it's some other need but your
[1:41:25] hearts cry can turn the attention and
[1:41:27] bring the RAM right to your heart amen
[1:41:33] we're not living in Genesis 18 we're not
[1:41:37] living in Genesis 19 we're living in
[1:41:40] Genesis 22 we're living in the time
[1:41:44] where the RAM has come forth we're
[1:41:48] living in the time of the rapture but in
[1:41:57] our we showed him infallible proofs but
[1:42:01] he spoke things to them concerning the
[1:42:03] kingdom of God you see it had the
[1:42:05] company of there's a voice that had to
[1:42:07] accompany this resurrection
[1:42:08] it spoke things concerning the kingdom
[1:42:11] of God remember they were looking they
[1:42:14] were looking for the kingdom of heaven
[1:42:16] right they were looking for the kingdom
[1:42:18] of God the partner they were looking for
[1:42:20] the kingdom of God and to recognize that
[1:42:22] that that in itself will actually then
[1:42:24] be set up here as we look even into that
[1:42:26] of the Millennium but yet the kingdom of
[1:42:28] God if first is entering in through him
[1:42:31] by the new birth but here in this life
[1:42:33] what they're looking for they're looking
[1:42:36] for what they were waiting on remember
[1:42:38] the Jews this is why the Pharisees
[1:42:40] themselves they put so much attention
[1:42:43] and so much detail on the outside they
[1:42:46] did this they did that they did this
[1:42:48] they did that but when you begin to look
[1:42:51] at it there is one great thing that they
[1:42:53] had a problem with self-righteousness
[1:42:55] and the thing that the Lord Jesus did
[1:42:58] what he did that they couldn't
[1:42:59] understand Jesus never denounced oh no
[1:43:01] you don't need to do good you don't need
[1:43:02] to do this you don't need to be
[1:43:04] considered to the fore you don't need to
[1:43:05] pay tithes and you don't even that's
[1:43:06] Jesus never said those things are not
[1:43:08] good what Jesus went to is the root of
[1:43:11] the problem is the inside the motives
[1:43:13] the root and he they didn't realize that
[1:43:15] first there's got to be the kingdom of
[1:43:18] God that will move in here and bring
[1:43:20] back a necessary change do you realize
[1:43:22] that many of these people they stood
[1:43:24] right in the face of the Lord Jesus and
[1:43:26] they said we ain't never been in bondage
[1:43:28] to sin well yeah for been in bondage to
[1:43:33] any man jesus said the servant abideth
[1:43:37] not in the house not a building but here
[1:43:40] does not abide forever but the son
[1:43:43] abideth forever because the house
[1:43:46] belongeth to the sons in my father's
[1:43:50] house are many mansions there's not oops
[1:43:54] I we forgot to build enough room oops we
[1:43:55] forgot I didn't make enough bodies oops
[1:43:57] I made too minute no it's just exactly
[1:44:00] what's been needed you love him we're
[1:44:09] getting closer
[1:44:13] but he assembled together with them now
[1:44:16] watch this he's assembled together with
[1:44:18] them he lets them know wait don't you
[1:44:21] will depart out of Jerusalem but you
[1:44:24] wait for the promise of the father which
[1:44:27] he saith you have heard of me for John
[1:44:30] truly baptized with water but you shall
[1:44:33] be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[1:44:35] days hence
[1:44:36] so here the Lord Jesus himself he's
[1:44:40] unfolding to them the very plan and the
[1:44:43] work of redemption now remember what
[1:44:45] they said here in Luke chapter 24 they
[1:44:47] said we trusted that it had been he
[1:44:49] which should have read
[1:44:51] Israel but remember with Redemption
[1:44:53] there's three parts to Redemption there
[1:44:55] is actually two where you and I were
[1:44:57] sold into slavery
[1:44:59] Romans picks it up Romans seven for that
[1:45:01] you and I were sold 7:14 sold into sin
[1:45:04] so you and I were were slaves unto sin
[1:45:07] but yet we were always sons and
[1:45:09] daughters of God now I'm talking about
[1:45:10] Redemption now so you and I actually had
[1:45:13] to be bought and then as we bought part
[1:45:16] of redemption is not just that we are
[1:45:19] bought but in being bought the purchase
[1:45:21] that is made you are actually removed
[1:45:24] from the market Redemption itself
[1:45:26] removes you from the market to where you
[1:45:28] can no longer be sold again glory be to
[1:45:32] God this is why the real redemption of
[1:45:35] the Holy Spirit it is that which makes
[1:45:37] known to you the purchase was made and
[1:45:40] you were included and you have been
[1:45:43] bought with a price you have been
[1:45:45] brought out of the market and you can
[1:45:47] never be sold again this is why Paul
[1:45:51] would so speak in Romans 6 that you and
[1:45:54] I ought to have such a jurisdiction from
[1:45:57] within our hearts by bringing our bodies
[1:45:59] in subjection to the Spirit of God that
[1:46:01] dwells on the inside and do not yield
[1:46:03] your members of instruments to
[1:46:06] unrighteousness but rather to
[1:46:08] righteousness as those which are alive
[1:46:11] from the dead this is redemption
[1:46:15] remember Redemption itself is for the
[1:46:18] predestinated for the elect now notice
[1:46:20] within this here how that he is making
[1:46:22] known to them of Redemption he's got to
[1:46:25] make this known because the word that
[1:46:27] they are using here in that we trusted
[1:46:30] it had been he that would redeem is
[1:46:32] where one who had actually be as the
[1:46:33] word goes Lutra one who is actually
[1:46:35] loosed but you see in order to be loosed
[1:46:38] there's got to be a kinsman redeemer in
[1:46:40] order to be loosed there's got to be a
[1:46:42] price paid somebody has to pay that
[1:46:44] price and so he now takes them by the
[1:46:47] scriptures they don't know who he is and
[1:46:49] yet they've walked with him all these
[1:46:51] years
[1:46:51] they don't seem their eyes are holding
[1:46:54] and you look at it why would it be
[1:46:56] because they needed to see him in the
[1:46:59] word he had led them by the word and
[1:47:01] they needed to see of how the his life
[1:47:03] and went right through the word and
[1:47:04] fulfilling the prophecies that had been
[1:47:07] spoken of him because there was a
[1:47:09] prophecy and prophecies in the word that
[1:47:12] had to be fulfilled in their life they
[1:47:15] would have to have confidence in that
[1:47:16] word and submit themselves to his work
[1:47:20] without a shepherd there's no way that
[1:47:23] it got to the upper room no way they
[1:47:26] would have got there over the same know
[1:47:28] their their elect but you're missing a
[1:47:29] key point God does not make the elect
[1:47:32] independent but rather they elect quite
[1:47:36] the contrary
[1:47:37] we're regarded as sheep and sheep are
[1:47:39] the most helpless animals there are I
[1:47:43] don't know about you but I can testify
[1:47:45] to that I need his help
[1:47:47] every moment oh brother send me your
[1:47:50] weak oh no no weak I'm strong when I'm
[1:47:53] weak I'm strong I testify to my
[1:47:56] helplessness
[1:47:56] I need him just like the Prophet would
[1:47:58] pick it up in the message the God poured
[1:48:00] that one many times he said I can't even
[1:48:02] he talks about the trophies he's God and
[1:48:04] everything he said I can't even should
[1:48:06] shoot a trophy deer
[1:48:07] I can't even shoot and catch a trophy
[1:48:09] but fish I can't even do all these
[1:48:10] things I need him in every moment of my
[1:48:13] life he said he is my god he said every
[1:48:16] trophy I've got everything that's taking
[1:48:18] place the healing of the sick all these
[1:48:20] things he is my guide oh I'll tell you
[1:48:24] friends he's not this being our kind in
[1:48:27] our life it's not something we put on on
[1:48:29] Sunday mornings and hanging up on Sunday
[1:48:31] afternoon it's not something we pick up
[1:48:33] on Thursday and then hang back up but
[1:48:35] the reality he is our God he is our life
[1:48:38] he is our joy he is our strength glory
[1:48:45] be to God now look at this here they had
[1:48:47] to know the price had been paid there
[1:48:50] had been one who was able to pay this
[1:48:52] price now think of this of how that the
[1:48:54] debt had been paid he had already been
[1:48:56] identified as the Lamb of God
[1:48:58] watch how Peter now picks this up here
[1:49:01] huh I'm coming I'm coming down I'm
[1:49:02] coming down we're getting ready here at
[1:49:04] chapter 1 verse 25 now our verse 15 the
[1:49:09] Bible says Peter stood up in the midst
[1:49:10] of the disciples and the number of names
[1:49:12] together were about 120 and men and
[1:49:15] brethren
[1:49:15] scripture must needs have been fulfilled
[1:49:18] which the holy ghost spoke by the mouth
[1:49:21] of David spake before concerning Judas
[1:49:24] which was God to them that took Jesus
[1:49:26] home on how brother man will pick that
[1:49:28] up he said this is what's important it
[1:49:30] wasn't David speaking it was the Holy
[1:49:31] Ghost that used David's mouth to speak
[1:49:33] and this was not David's words this was
[1:49:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:49:37] do you realize that Peter him in this
[1:49:39] time notice these very things when Peter
[1:49:41] said when the Lord Jesus said I've got
[1:49:43] to suffer I've got to be rejected and
[1:49:45] all these things does Peter rebuked him
[1:49:47] but look at this this is entirely
[1:49:49] different Peter and picks up the
[1:49:51] scripture from the Psalms of he who was
[1:49:54] my friend have lifted his hand against
[1:49:56] me he picks this up and says it is
[1:49:59] necessary that this scripture has been
[1:50:01] fulfilled glory be to God it's different
[1:50:06] you see things that he didn't understand
[1:50:08] now it's breaking why it's time it's
[1:50:11] time now I want you to remember the end
[1:50:16] of Luke 24 tells us they came to this
[1:50:18] Upper Room not was sad and gloom the
[1:50:21] Bible says after his departure they've
[1:50:23] returned back to Jerusalem with great
[1:50:25] joy remember said they returned with
[1:50:29] great joy because the promise was sure
[1:50:31] he made the promise and they could go
[1:50:34] ahead and have joy you see joy while you
[1:50:36] were too rich you get the problem no joy
[1:50:37] is assured joy because the promise is
[1:50:39] sure I can have joy right now while I am
[1:50:41] waiting on the very change of the body
[1:50:43] I've already experienced the change of
[1:50:45] the soul there can be some setting right
[1:50:47] here this morning that's already
[1:50:49] experienced that of a part in a degree
[1:50:51] of the change of the Holy Spirit where
[1:50:53] he's called you out of sin there might
[1:50:54] be all sorts of things still in your
[1:50:56] life right now and you recognize that
[1:50:57] but there's joy that you have to know
[1:50:59] that he's called me out of the world and
[1:51:01] you can have joy to know that the same
[1:51:02] one that called you out of the world is
[1:51:04] the same God that can clean you up and
[1:51:06] those that are cleaned up can have joy
[1:51:08] to know that he made the promise he
[1:51:10] would fill you up and those that are
[1:51:11] filled up to know you can have the
[1:51:13] promise he'll grow you up and to those
[1:51:15] that are wrote up he will actually take
[1:51:17] us over that dividing line we have joy
[1:51:21] tell me when a believer cannot have joy
[1:51:26] little Sammy you don't want a bunch of
[1:51:28] fanaticism I ain't seen fanaticism I've
[1:51:31] been able to go to a lot of places here
[1:51:33] recently within the past few years
[1:51:35] I ain't seen none but I have seen people
[1:51:37] that have joy and anytime you have joy
[1:51:40] there's always wet blankets around but I
[1:51:43] don't want to be a wet blanket can't put
[1:51:46] strings of quotes on me buddy I'm not
[1:51:48] gonna be over there's not gonna be a wet
[1:51:49] blanket we have a right to have joy in
[1:51:52] the Lord David himself danced when he
[1:51:56] saw the word coming back come on friends
[1:51:59] it was something about the world that
[1:52:02] produced joy in his life this is what
[1:52:06] makes me question and Wonder have people
[1:52:08] really experienced God do they really
[1:52:10] know what the experience and presence of
[1:52:13] the Lord is or is it just quotes is it
[1:52:15] just scriptures is it just words is it
[1:52:17] something where it's just I wonder
[1:52:19] what's going on but there is people oh
[1:52:21] my yeah you can experience and to
[1:52:23] experience God answering questions the
[1:52:26] Holy Spirit discerning hearts and
[1:52:28] breaking that word to our life you know
[1:52:30] what it is the wild side' world and
[1:52:32] others can classify fanatics they did
[1:52:35] the same thing through every time you're
[1:52:36] off in fanatics you're often fanaticism
[1:52:39] but brother we're not fanatics we know
[1:52:41] in whom we have believed we recognize
[1:52:44] the presence of Almighty God this world
[1:52:46] is rejoiced into our hearts
[1:52:51] hallelujah I don't see painted face
[1:52:54] women dancing around I don't see that
[1:52:58] who glory hats to one coming down when
[1:53:11] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:53:14] were all with one Accord in one place
[1:53:17] that was a miracle
[1:53:18] I said that was a miracle
[1:53:22] they were in harmony with one another
[1:53:24] that's a miracle the holy ghost ain't
[1:53:27] even come yet but watch the atmosphere
[1:53:30] of the word was already bringing them
[1:53:33] together in order for the fulfillment to
[1:53:36] move in you see what the word itself
[1:53:38] will do the atmosphere of the Word of
[1:53:40] God it brings like it did in Genesis 1
[1:53:43] it brings things in condition that the
[1:53:46] word itself might be fulfilled God was
[1:53:49] not going to step into a bunch of
[1:53:51] disunity he was not going to do that but
[1:53:54] what was it that brought him together
[1:53:56] it was not programs but it was the very
[1:53:59] promised word of that hour of which they
[1:54:03] were identified with it brought them
[1:54:06] together to wait for that part to be
[1:54:09] fulfilled in them it wasn't enough that
[1:54:12] they knew John's ministry it wasn't
[1:54:15] enough that they knew the second fold
[1:54:17] and knew Jesus ministry that wasn't
[1:54:20] enough they needed to have the coming of
[1:54:23] the Lord in them they needed to have the
[1:54:26] third pull in their life are you with me
[1:54:30] it had to come in there it wasn't enough
[1:54:33] remember there were those that were in
[1:54:34] acts 19 they were believed in John's
[1:54:36] baptism the Bible calls them disciples
[1:54:39] of John and when Paul got there Paul
[1:54:42] began to talk to him and he realized hey
[1:54:44] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:54:46] you believe not when you believe have
[1:54:48] you received it since your beliefs he he
[1:54:50] realized part of Redemption you first
[1:54:52] got to believe but he went there and
[1:54:55] here they were they were walking in the
[1:54:57] first in the second pool but he goes to
[1:54:59] them there and here what they didn't
[1:55:01] recognize that the atonement there's
[1:55:03] already been an offering up because
[1:55:05] remember a policy was preaching that
[1:55:07] Jesus and indeed was the Christ
[1:55:09] this guy was shown by the scriptures
[1:55:10] he's indeed the Christ let me just put
[1:55:13] it to you like this he was shown that
[1:55:14] the message was absolutely the truth but
[1:55:18] that's where they were remaining it's
[1:55:20] the truth this is the true Word of God
[1:55:21] well the message has come today that's
[1:55:23] all they were but Paul said wait a
[1:55:24] minute here have you received the token
[1:55:27] have you received the Holy Ghost while
[1:55:30] we have not even heard whether there be
[1:55:32] any Holy Ghost
[1:55:34] that's the message brother the messaging
[1:55:38] tapes and books the message is about the
[1:55:41] Living God Amen him coming on the inside
[1:55:45] and then he manifests his glory through
[1:55:48] our lives glory be to God oh ma this is
[1:55:56] a day of Pentecost fully coming because
[1:56:00] remember what a kinsman can do a kinsman
[1:56:02] redeemed persons and inheritance their
[1:56:08] inheritance had been lost and he was
[1:56:10] redeeming his persons Oh glory be to God
[1:56:17] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:56:19] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and
[1:56:21] it filled all the house where they were
[1:56:23] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:56:26] cloven tongues like as a fire and it's
[1:56:29] sat upon each of them and they were all
[1:56:32] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:56:34] speak with other tongues as the Spirit
[1:56:36] gave them utterance
[1:56:39] they came out of that room they were
[1:56:43] aware that there had been a Jubilee they
[1:56:48] were aware indeed this was a day of
[1:56:50] Pentecost they were aware when they came
[1:56:54] out of this room here I want you to
[1:56:56] notice it wasn't just falling everywhere
[1:56:58] else it came there to where they were
[1:57:00] assembled by the word I hope you don't
[1:57:05] misunderstand me I'm not going to go in
[1:57:06] and preach this but you know listen
[1:57:08] friends the Bible speaks of this as
[1:57:10] Peter goes into it here that his spirit
[1:57:12] is poured out upon all flesh that's why
[1:57:16] you have inspiration people can write
[1:57:18] songs they have down through the ages
[1:57:19] and not even believers as far as walking
[1:57:22] in the light but what remember who wears
[1:57:24] that inspiration it's come from you got
[1:57:26] to check everything by the word but you
[1:57:28] see it's even to understand that is
[1:57:30] where did that come from come on now
[1:57:34] that song brother Brian just something
[1:57:36] right here I was there when the Spirit
[1:57:37] came brother Brian told that choir
[1:57:39] director in the beginning of the insan
[1:57:41] there in Arizona then he went to sing
[1:57:43] another song brother brems said sing one
[1:57:44] a little snappier you know why because
[1:57:47] Spirit of God had already fell a
[1:57:50] previous couple of nights ago when that
[1:57:52] song was being sung let me tell you some
[1:57:54] the Holy Ghost likes music surely he
[1:57:58] likes music I'm gonna tell you something
[1:58:00] it's very very important it did not the
[1:58:02] angel of the Lord liked the song only
[1:58:04] belief there are songs that sin they
[1:58:06] only believe song book they denounced in
[1:58:09] those early years come on now now how
[1:58:12] long I'm going here they denounced those
[1:58:14] things and those are in or early times
[1:58:16] but yet you know what brother damn could
[1:58:17] stand there and sing it one of them one
[1:58:19] of them you know to sing that song
[1:58:20] you're identified Pentecostal Methodist
[1:58:23] wouldn't identified you're identified
[1:58:26] Pentecostal come on friends you know
[1:58:28] what it was inspiration that's poured
[1:58:30] out within that time glory man we could
[1:58:35] really roll on that thing but I want you
[1:58:37] I wonder what I'm trying to get you to
[1:58:38] see is that here the Holy Spirit it's
[1:58:40] coming to the chosen vessels here to
[1:58:43] bring you and I into that real release
[1:58:45] remember Jesus here in John 16 had said
[1:58:48] I've got many things to say to you but
[1:58:50] you can't bear them now I thought that
[1:58:54] to me is such a precious scripture
[1:58:55] because Jesus could have just unloaded
[1:58:57] but what good would have done well good
[1:59:00] they want understood it at that time
[1:59:02] right but he said I got many things to
[1:59:05] send to you but then you're not able to
[1:59:08] bear him right now
[1:59:09] I'm glad that God knows when were able
[1:59:12] to bear him I'm glad that he holds it in
[1:59:17] his hand I understand that Paul said we
[1:59:20] are to be when he would speak of the
[1:59:22] ministry stewards of the ministry
[1:59:24] mysteries I agree but I believe it as
[1:59:26] the Prophet spoken it's not us going in
[1:59:29] separate it's the same Spirit of God
[1:59:30] that delivered it to the Prophet and
[1:59:32] that same spirit of God that will turn
[1:59:34] around and deliver it just as we have
[1:59:36] meat of it it's not us prying in it's
[1:59:39] not us being self-reliant it's us
[1:59:41] depending on him and he gives just as we
[1:59:46] have need of it his promise was that
[1:59:48] when the Spirit of Truth has come he
[1:59:49] would lead and guide you into all to
[1:59:52] truth not just bring you up to it but
[1:59:54] into it totally for he shall not speak
[1:59:58] of himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[2:00:01] shally speak and he will show you things
[2:00:03] to come he shall glorify me for he shall
[2:00:06] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[2:00:09] you now let's let's break in here and
[2:00:12] we're closing
[2:00:14] we started our descent can you see the
[2:00:16] lights of the city I can all no see the
[2:00:21] lights of that city verse 14 but Peter
[2:00:27] standing up with the eleven lifted up
[2:00:30] his voice and said unto them you men of
[2:00:33] Judea and all you that dwell in
[2:00:35] Jerusalem be this known didn t you and
[2:00:37] hearken to my words hearken to your
[2:00:41] words who do you think you are woo but
[2:00:47] you see he had a word of authority come
[2:00:51] on friends this was not his words but
[2:00:53] yet it was his words you see it was
[2:00:55] words that had been prophesied before
[2:00:58] but now it's been revealed to him the
[2:01:01] secret things belong to the Lord but
[2:01:02] those things that are revealed belong
[2:01:04] unto us and to our children Peter
[2:01:11] standing up there being known unto you
[2:01:13] and hearken to my words for these are
[2:01:15] not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is
[2:01:19] but the third out of the day but this is
[2:01:22] that which was spoken by the Prophet
[2:01:24] Joel he's identifying it this is what
[2:01:27] was prophesied this is what's come and
[2:01:31] it shall come to pass in the last day
[2:01:33] save god I will pour my spirit upon all
[2:01:35] flesh and your sons and your daughters
[2:01:37] shall prophesy and your young men shall
[2:01:39] see visions and your old men shall dream
[2:01:41] dreams and on my servants notice here's
[2:01:43] the verse 18 and on my servants and on
[2:01:46] my handmaids will I pour out in those
[2:01:48] days of my spirit and they shall
[2:01:51] prophesy so to realize there's many that
[2:01:53] the Spirit of God can fall upon they can
[2:01:56] experience many things listen remember
[2:01:58] justification is a work of the Holy
[2:02:00] Ghost sanctification is a work of the
[2:02:02] Holy Ghost but remember it's all part of
[2:02:05] the process of God himself bringing you
[2:02:07] and I back to himself in full Redemption
[2:02:10] to where that by the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:12] Ghost he's
[2:02:13] steps in to occupy that cavern Akal that
[2:02:16] he has called and that he has cleaned up
[2:02:18] and then he sets to hell in the throne
[2:02:20] of our heart and we become a habitation
[2:02:22] a dwelling place where the Lord Himself
[2:02:25] is dwelling and his presence is there
[2:02:28] from going forth from our life this is
[2:02:31] why let me just say it drop this little
[2:02:34] bit you might work with somebody they
[2:02:36] can say you know the Holy Spirit spoke
[2:02:39] to me and told me to you know ask that
[2:02:43] you'd pray for me
[2:02:44] well you know the Holy Spirit spoke to
[2:02:46] me this morning on this don't knock that
[2:02:49] the bride of Jesus Christ is that the
[2:02:51] only one that the Holy Spirit can speak
[2:02:53] to he speaks to us as in a specific way
[2:02:58] has his servants and his hand mates but
[2:03:01] he also has there's others that's out
[2:03:04] there though they're not included in
[2:03:06] redemption but yet they have enough to
[2:03:08] be able to ask for salvation to believe
[2:03:12] the price has been paid and they can
[2:03:16] have enough have faith to be able to
[2:03:19] believe God would give them faith to be
[2:03:21] able to believe they may never see what
[2:03:23] you and I see that's not given to us or
[2:03:26] to anybody else that's already
[2:03:28] determined by God but salvation itself
[2:03:31] there's people that can actually have
[2:03:34] faith and believe in the purchase aren't
[2:03:39] you glad for that man I am I'm real glad
[2:03:43] for that verse 19 he goes on down let me
[2:03:48] just skip to verse 22 we just dropped a
[2:03:52] couple thousand feet real quick
[2:03:53] verse 22 gay men of Israel hear these
[2:03:58] words Wow Wow hears these words what an
[2:04:04] assurance these are not that you can't
[2:04:08] run him from this try to tell me how are
[2:04:11] you one of them
[2:04:12] you're a Galilean I know don't think you
[2:04:14] were there in the garden you can't run
[2:04:15] him from this now brother because at
[2:04:18] that time here the very life that's
[2:04:20] inside of him was in that corporal body
[2:04:22] of the Lord Jesus but the sacrifice
[2:04:25] has already been offered up he's already
[2:04:28] unfolded the plan of redemption to him
[2:04:31] he told him wait on the Holy Ghost for
[2:04:33] when the Holy Ghost has come he'll then
[2:04:35] know that you are included in Redemption
[2:04:39] and thus in question will be settled
[2:04:42] this is something that Peter is standing
[2:04:44] here by Authority now there's an
[2:04:46] absolute now it's been unfolded I've not
[2:04:48] only been purchased purchased out of the
[2:04:50] market but I've been loosed I have been
[2:04:52] neutral recovered by a ransom I have
[2:04:57] been recovered brought back you love him
[2:05:03] ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus
[2:05:07] of Nazareth a man approved of God among
[2:05:11] you by miracles wonders and signs which
[2:05:14] God did by him in the midst of you as
[2:05:16] you yourselves also know Omaha look how
[2:05:19] Peter placing that in there him being
[2:05:22] delivered by the determinate counsel and
[2:05:25] foreknowledge of God isn't incredible on
[2:05:27] the way to the road to Emmaus they said
[2:05:30] we trusted it had been him who had
[2:05:32] redeemed Israel but here our rulers and
[2:05:35] so forth have taken him and delivered
[2:05:37] him Peter realizes now this was part of
[2:05:41] the plan of God he was delivered by the
[2:05:44] determinate counsel and knowledge
[2:05:48] foreknowledge of God ye have taken and
[2:05:51] by wicked hands have crucified and slain
[2:05:53] whom God hath raised up having loosed
[2:05:56] the pains of death because it was not
[2:05:57] possible that he should be Holden of it
[2:06:00] forgave it speak of concerning him oh my
[2:06:03] goodness look at all these things coming
[2:06:05] together right now now in the loonie of
[2:06:08] the Holy Spirit leading them into all
[2:06:09] truth things that were they had
[2:06:11] questions here it is the Spirit of God
[2:06:13] is just assembling these things and ma
[2:06:16] they're just illuminated for David spoke
[2:06:18] concerning him I foresaw the lie foresaw
[2:06:21] the Lord always before my face for he is
[2:06:24] on my right hand that I should not be
[2:06:25] moved you think they just read this they
[2:06:27] didn't just read this they already knew
[2:06:30] this but now they know it they don't
[2:06:34] just know it by what David said but now
[2:06:36] the Spirit
[2:06:37] God has brought to remembrance what he
[2:06:40] has said remember when he was with them
[2:06:43] they showed up at the tomb and the angel
[2:06:45] said remember what he said when he was
[2:06:48] with you brother Graham said them angels
[2:06:50] were there the whole time that he was
[2:06:51] preaching and the Angels brought back to
[2:06:54] them what they had forgotten and aren't
[2:06:56] you glad that the presence of God and
[2:06:58] the angels of God are right here
[2:07:00] encamped among those who fear God and
[2:07:03] are able to bring back to you and I
[2:07:05] attention certain things that have been
[2:07:07] said it's God keeping his word who
[2:07:13] horribie to God the same way that angel
[2:07:15] the Lord visited that neighborhood when
[2:07:16] that's when that little sister was
[2:07:18] pronounced hold that's the same way the
[2:07:20] angel of the Lord visits our homes you
[2:07:23] believe that your witness to that you
[2:07:26] come that back around and he'll visit
[2:07:28] and bring things back to our attention
[2:07:29] it slipped her mind you might be a
[2:07:31] scripture I quote it might have been
[2:07:33] something was set here by by some by
[2:07:35] some individual but it's still God
[2:07:37] you'll bring a right back you know what
[2:07:38] it is because there's virtue in that
[2:07:40] word there is no virtue in our thoughts
[2:07:42] there's no virtue in our words but there
[2:07:45] is virtue in the living word of Almighty
[2:07:48] God there is virtue and healing to save
[2:07:52] and to deliver when Peter got done with
[2:07:55] this sermon on the day of Pentecost the
[2:07:57] people themselves had come to such a
[2:07:59] place to say what must we do to be saved
[2:08:04] what was it virtue was falling from the
[2:08:08] word it brought conviction in their life
[2:08:11] it raised their faith to be able to
[2:08:14] recognize this is for me this is done
[2:08:17] for me what do I have to do to be saved
[2:08:19] I believe that's what the word does in
[2:08:24] opens for us it opens entrance for us
[2:08:27] yet puts before us a vision it puts
[2:08:30] before so that you and I can walk if
[2:08:32] you're defeated you get a place to get
[2:08:35] that vision before you have a perfect
[2:08:37] victory come on now what's that I do
[2:08:40] with Jesus called Christ he said here
[2:08:42] you are
[2:08:42] he said you're sitting with an
[2:08:43] affliction in your body he said if you
[2:08:45] can just get a vision of a person that
[2:08:47] is right before you that is perfectly
[2:08:50] whole
[2:08:51] he said you walk step by step by step
[2:08:54] until you become that person
[2:08:56] I'm telling you brother the world is an
[2:08:59] open vision there is no negative within
[2:09:02] that word by his stops you and I were
[2:09:05] healed there is positive within the
[2:09:07] blood of Jesus Christ because it's
[2:09:09] through the blood of Jesus Christ that
[2:09:11] all the negative and sin and everything
[2:09:14] was absolutely defeated and where that
[2:09:16] he absolutely trialed over all authority
[2:09:20] of death hell and the grave that same
[2:09:23] word is brought to you and I right here
[2:09:26] this morning
[2:09:26] that same word were brought right back
[2:09:28] to John said I saw a lamb I turned to
[2:09:35] see a lion but I saw a lamb bloody he
[2:09:44] was there for me was there for you he
[2:09:48] was there for all of the seed down
[2:09:49] through the ages
[2:09:50] he's been there on the mediatorial seat
[2:09:53] and in this hour how the Spirit of God
[2:09:58] makes known to us what he has done in
[2:10:01] this hour and in this hour he reaches
[2:10:03] back and now it's opening up all of the
[2:10:07] whole folds of redemption Ruth and bow
[2:10:11] has Abraham and Sarah
[2:10:13] the earth it opens it all wide it's time
[2:10:18] it's time this is the season this is the
[2:10:22] hour for understanding for a people who
[2:10:26] by God's grace are ordained to take the
[2:10:30] rapture it's not by accident that you
[2:10:37] heard God's voice
[2:10:39] I'm not talking about the voice of a
[2:10:41] Kentuckian I'm talking about God's voice
[2:10:44] the voice within the voice you
[2:10:49] understand what I'm saying many at Pearl
[2:10:51] Harbor the Prophet tells us in sudden
[2:10:52] secret going away
[2:10:53] he said they heard a voice screaming out
[2:10:55] he said but they never gave heed to that
[2:10:57] voice he said but what it was they
[2:10:59] failed to hear the voice that was within
[2:11:01] that voice
[2:11:02] you see that's important to hear that
[2:11:04] voice that's within that voice it's the
[2:11:06] very Lamb of God speaking to our hearts
[2:11:09] brother it's God Himself making himself
[2:11:12] known personally to our lives this is
[2:11:17] where that Peter could go on and stay
[2:11:19] and say let me freely speak concerning
[2:11:23] the patriarch David he goes on to let it
[2:11:26] be known that he's both dead and buried
[2:11:29] his Sepulchre is with us unto this day
[2:11:31] therefore being a prophet and knowing
[2:11:33] that God has sworn note to him that are
[2:11:35] the fruit of his loins according to the
[2:11:36] flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on
[2:11:39] his throne he's seeing this before spake
[2:11:42] of the resurrection of Christ that his
[2:11:45] soul was not left in Hell neither his
[2:11:47] flesh did see corruption
[2:11:49] this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we
[2:11:53] are all witnesses this is not what they
[2:11:59] read and knew this is what they know by
[2:12:03] experience this is what's been revealed
[2:12:05] to them and made known to him I hope you
[2:12:10] don't misunderstand me you may not be
[2:12:14] able to put everything together that's
[2:12:16] maybe not what you're called to do to me
[2:12:19] as a matter of fact even to have a gift
[2:12:21] to minister it's not even about you
[2:12:23] being able to put everything together I
[2:12:24] understand how things are teachers and
[2:12:27] how all those things and gifts and so
[2:12:28] forth would look but remember a gift is
[2:12:30] not for a man to lay his hands on and
[2:12:32] use it a gift is for God to use rent
[2:12:37] held us over and over he said a gift is
[2:12:38] not like a knife where you take it and
[2:12:39] cut your way into something but a gift
[2:12:41] is used
[2:12:43] for his people it's God using the gift
[2:12:47] and remember what the gifts are given
[2:12:50] for in Ephesians 4 it's part of the
[2:12:53] victorious parade that where it is
[2:12:56] dispersed out there to proclaim that
[2:12:59] Redemption has come and is coming fully
[2:13:03] that's the whole purpose of the
[2:13:07] ministering gifts is to point to the
[2:13:09] finished work of Calvary of what he
[2:13:12] already has done for you and I and that
[2:13:16] that life that was within him is for you
[2:13:20] and that life moving on the inside of
[2:13:23] you and I taking claim it settles the
[2:13:27] sin question ask me ask your neighbor
[2:13:34] where these people said anymore not at
[2:13:37] this point did they experience
[2:13:39] discouragement after that they did were
[2:13:45] there times things didn't happen the way
[2:13:47] that they thought then maybe it should
[2:13:48] have happened sure sometimes Paul was
[2:13:52] able to walk out of the city other times
[2:13:54] they had to sneak him down in a basket
[2:13:55] then seemed very spiritual but it was
[2:13:58] God leading you isn't he he's God
[2:14:03] leading I mean the Spirit of God could
[2:14:05] speak straight to Paul and let Paul know
[2:14:07] Paul ducked this way go out this way go
[2:14:08] up that way but instead God had it to
[2:14:10] her a little boy would hear and a little
[2:14:12] boy would come until this guard hear hey
[2:14:13] they're plotting to kill Paul and so
[2:14:15] forth then the guard would hear in the
[2:14:17] Roman guard okay we got to take him out
[2:14:18] this way and take him under cover and so
[2:14:20] forth see God has it in such a way it's
[2:14:23] in such humility it never removed when
[2:14:27] this came in their life and it comes in
[2:14:30] our life it doesn't remove humility
[2:14:32] sometimes we don't know how things are
[2:14:34] going to work out there's things there's
[2:14:36] ways that we would like things to happen
[2:14:38] in a certain way and it doesn't always
[2:14:40] happen that way but there's one thing
[2:14:43] about it if we look to him everything's
[2:14:47] happening just according to his plan you
[2:14:51] might look in your life this morning you
[2:14:53] think
[2:14:54] but Sammy there's mistakes and things
[2:14:56] that I've made how in the world romans 8
[2:15:03] all things work together for the good
[2:15:07] you didn't say all things were good are
[2:15:12] you with me all things work together for
[2:15:15] the good there's things that we have had
[2:15:18] to learn things that we've had to go
[2:15:22] through and you have to go through in
[2:15:24] order to know it personally man I'll
[2:15:30] tell you this keeps going but I hope
[2:15:33] you're with me on this when that sin
[2:15:37] question is settled on the inside the
[2:15:40] desire of sin is gone and you know I was
[2:15:46] included in that purchase and the love
[2:15:50] of the world is gone you might look at
[2:15:54] your life and say I'm perfect that's not
[2:15:56] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[2:15:58] his perfection you and I have been made
[2:16:02] free from the law of sin and death by
[2:16:06] the spirit of life it's set you and I
[2:16:12] free are you with me it's set us free it
[2:16:17] loosens us by that nature to where we
[2:16:21] don't desire the things of the world we
[2:16:24] desire to please him we desire Lord I
[2:16:28] want to grow to being more like you I
[2:16:31] want to grow to be more like you Lord I
[2:16:34] want to walk patiently if there's things
[2:16:36] you know there's things I don't
[2:16:38] understand but I know that just as he
[2:16:41] has revealed just what I need
[2:16:43] he'll reveal it in due time he's
[2:16:46] faithful he's faithful and you know what
[2:16:49] that moment comes from me to step and
[2:16:52] you to step from this body into that
[2:16:54] other one it'll be there it'll be there
[2:16:59] amen that revelation it'll be there at
[2:17:01] that moment that final fold will break
[2:17:04] upon our lives it'll be there in that
[2:17:06] moment this is sure it's a sure word of
[2:17:11] prophecy and what an assurance I'll tell
[2:17:15] you this morning if you don't have that
[2:17:16] assurance like Peter spoke of you can
[2:17:19] have that you first have got to believe
[2:17:22] that's part of it and you secondly
[2:17:24] you've got in part of believing you've
[2:17:26] got to repent
[2:17:29] thus I mean that seems Elementary
[2:17:31] Oh God don't ever let us and let us
[2:17:33] leave the elementary things but when you
[2:17:38] repent then being baptized in the name
[2:17:40] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[2:17:41] remission of your sins and you shall
[2:17:44] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the
[2:17:48] Holy Ghost is what separates us from the
[2:17:51] world not because we believe God sent a
[2:17:56] message that's don't separate us that'll
[2:17:59] separate us it's the Holy Spirit that
[2:18:03] separates us that is his seal his seal
[2:18:09] that says we are yes we belong to him we
[2:18:16] have been bought with a price we are
[2:18:19] redeemed by the blood of the Lamb all
[2:18:23] the spare hands or Jesus
[2:18:31] Lord you're so faithful Lord as we look
[2:18:37] here more than your word see Lord God
[2:18:42] how that what do we had testified at
[2:18:45] that same reality Oh God
[2:18:50] we're Peter Lord to stand there on that
[2:18:53] day how different it was
[2:18:56] he stood Lord with a full assurance it
[2:19:02] wasn't just an assurance that you were
[2:19:05] the Messiah that you were the son of God
[2:19:07] but it had been revealed to him Lord in
[2:19:10] a very personal way in him and what is
[2:19:15] you or the son of God you're the ransom
[2:19:18] our kinsman you became my sword Peter
[2:19:24] would go on to say as Stephen and the
[2:19:26] rest of you who were with them in the
[2:19:28] Tabernacle in the wilderness this that
[2:19:31] was spoken by the hands of the prophets
[2:19:33] the mouths of the prophets down through
[2:19:35] the time this is that what they were
[2:19:40] able to identify this experience that
[2:19:42] they had in their life it was a word
[2:19:44] experience he didn't take them out of
[2:19:47] the word it brought him into the word to
[2:19:51] where Lord God the prophecies Lord God
[2:19:55] they've seen him in fulfillment
[2:19:58] realizing more God but the word have
[2:20:01] been spoken it was spoken with them in
[2:20:03] mind
