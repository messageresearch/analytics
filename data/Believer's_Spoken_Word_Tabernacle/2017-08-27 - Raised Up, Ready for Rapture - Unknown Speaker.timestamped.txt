[47:22] verse 19
[47:29] open to me the gate of righteousness I

[47:48] heard me and I'll become my salvation
[47:52] the stone which the builders refused has
[47:56] become the headstone of the corner this
[48:00] is the Lord's doing it is marvelous
[48:07] I'd like to just take a little thought
[48:10] here just title it raised up ready for
[48:16] rapture raised up and ready for wrap may
[48:22] God bless you bless the word as you're
[48:24] being seated just want to just speak to
[48:28] here just a few moments before I go into
[48:30] the text here I want to say that I
[48:37] wanted to be able to somebody you knew
[48:40] with the trip that I just had here up in
[48:45] Connecticut and that trip that that kind
[48:49] of came up after there'd been some other
[48:53] meetings that I had already got led on
[48:56] my heart to go ahead and take and the
[48:58] the burden within that particular taking
[49:03] that and going there in Connecticut they
[49:06] the I wanted to make known so that you
[49:09] you are a part when if I'm not here I'm
[49:12] going somewhere else
[49:13] I'm counting on your prayers when when
[49:17] when I'm out the ministry and the Lord
[49:21] certainly knows my heart if all I did
[49:24] was stay at home I would be a happy man
[49:27] but the the burden was there where the
[49:35] pastor that was there with that assembly
[49:37] left a message and walked away from it
[49:41] and
[49:42] so the the burden there's ministry that
[49:46] has been going in there and we just had
[49:52] on a heart just to pray for him and then
[49:53] I was received a call about coming up
[49:57] and ministering to them and so we went
[50:00] there this the past weekend and just to
[50:03] minister to them and I bring this to you
[50:05] if you just would keep them in prayer
[50:07] they are there praying that the Lord
[50:10] would send a pastor to them I know they
[50:14] have a few brothers that they're praying
[50:17] about and there were things that I was
[50:19] able to set down and some of the ways I
[50:22] took when I ministered felt let on my
[50:24] heart even an opening there on the first
[50:27] night just to kind of speak to them on
[50:30] where do we go from here
[50:32] and to really be focused where to be
[50:36] focused on and I had i titled a message
[50:39] the focus of the hour and dealt with how
[50:42] that the enemy and bring distractions to
[50:46] you that can trouble you and want to
[50:50] remove from you the focus of the hour
[50:53] and I I just have placed it to him like
[50:56] this I said you know you know me with
[50:58] examples of food I said it's like this
[51:01] if I invite you to my house you know I'm
[51:03] gonna have my wife cook something that I
[51:04] like I'm not gonna invite you and have
[51:07] her cook something that I don't like I
[51:08] said so if I invite you to my house and
[51:11] you decide not to come oh well I'm gonna
[51:16] eat anyhow that just means it more from
[51:19] me and and I say that in the manner it's
[51:23] sad to wear when there are lives and
[51:25] hearts that if for them they have made
[51:28] their choice and they go in their way
[51:29] but the thing that I was leading dealing
[51:32] with the Spirit of God is don't allow
[51:34] any bitterness to set in in your heart
[51:37] don't be focused on on that on the
[51:39] person who left or those who's left
[51:41] don't even focus on what's been said
[51:43] they focused on the objective and that
[51:46] is the rapture
[51:47] that's the coming of the Lord remain
[51:49] focused on that because you know the
[51:52] thing is is that we walk on with the
[51:54] Lord and
[51:55] and we are in times that truly are our
[51:59] times that show forth of maturity in the
[52:03] hour we're living in where all seeds are
[52:05] truly coming to maturity and within this
[52:09] hour where we see things that are are
[52:12] coming about it's only also how we
[52:14] witness that God steps forth in the hour
[52:17] and make this word even that much more
[52:20] real and so you know I I mentioned them
[52:24] I said you know we don't dislike anybody
[52:26] we don't hate anybody but if a person
[52:29] chooses and this is the pathway that
[52:31] they choose to go they can go ahead and
[52:33] go that way we walk on with the Lord and
[52:36] that's the focus of the hour is to stay
[52:39] focused and don't become distracted by
[52:42] accusations don't become distracted even
[52:45] to where your attitude your objective
[52:47] your mind your spirit anything is
[52:49] affected let your focus be on Jesus
[52:52] Christ and the focus with being upon him
[52:55] is letting this word be so thoroughly
[52:57] applied in our lives each and every day
[53:00] and so the people were really encouraged
[53:05] with that and then we we just spoke on
[53:07] another thought there on on Sunday
[53:10] morning when I dealt with the progenitor
[53:12] of the seed and dealt with the seed life
[53:14] and how that it's the image of the
[53:17] Father and how that it is the fathering
[53:20] of of children and how that we indeed
[53:23] are the children of God and that you
[53:25] know I was basing with things when
[53:27] brother Branham wouldn't be on the
[53:28] curtain of time he said are these all
[53:31] Brennan and what did they what did the
[53:34] angel the Lord say no these are your
[53:37] conference you know it's not you we
[53:42] weren't we haven't been earthly father
[53:43] it's been our Heavenly Father come
[53:46] through the word that has brought birth
[53:47] in our lives so we bear the reflection
[53:50] and image of Jesus Christ and so we
[53:54] dealt with those with those things and
[53:56] of the assurance and just the boldness
[53:59] which Paul spake to adhere and walk in
[54:02] what God had given him so we were
[54:04] dealing with a lot of those things and
[54:06] you know what's wonderful how the Word
[54:08] of God just keeps open
[54:09] and they're wonderful even in the meth
[54:13] ings sometimes that you you don't even
[54:15] realize or you're in the midst of it and
[54:16] things are being spoken even then and
[54:18] gods dealing with things even then that
[54:20] it's just the it continues to open the
[54:23] picture doesn't become more fragmented
[54:26] the picture becomes more clear because
[54:29] the the message is not just just parts
[54:32] and pieces is it's a person and so it's
[54:36] an entire picture and you know for just
[54:39] to have one part of the puzzle is not to
[54:41] have the puzzle is to have just one part
[54:43] and you're only seeing one person you're
[54:45] only seeing one perspective one part but
[54:47] it's to have the entirety of it and
[54:49] what's most important is is having him
[54:52] who is the picture because he'll guide
[54:54] everything that needs to come together
[54:56] things sometimes look like shades come
[54:58] together all this red shade looks like
[55:00] this comes for this tree here and then
[55:02] you get it up there those those pieces
[55:04] aren't fitting the shades we might have
[55:06] seen it with your eye but God knows
[55:08] exactly where every piece goes and
[55:10] that's the that's the comfort that we
[55:12] have in the Lord so I just I just ask
[55:15] that you would just continue to keep
[55:17] them in prayer and I wanted to share
[55:19] that with you because I didn't get a
[55:20] chance to mention it to all some knew
[55:22] for some time that I was going there
[55:24] just a minister to them and to that need
[55:26] that's there and so just keep those
[55:29] brothers and sisters in prayer if you
[55:31] would there from Connecticut let's look
[55:37] here into the word I love the word of
[55:39] God don't you it's more rich and more
[55:42] precious with each and every every
[55:44] everyday in every moment David here when
[55:48] we look in the scripture these the
[55:50] Psalms here David speaks of the gates of
[55:54] righteousness in the very first verse
[55:56] and he says I will go in to them this in
[56:03] verse 20 this gate of the Lord so we
[56:08] know that even when we look in terms of
[56:11] gates within the scripture that gates
[56:15] are are meant to give access but it's
[56:20] not if if gates
[56:22] themselves are just simply without
[56:26] restriction then they're not much of a
[56:28] gate they're more decorative and we know
[56:31] that that the Word of God is not
[56:34] decorative but the Word of God there is
[56:37] truly a provided way that we can walk in
[56:42] and we can come in to God's desired
[56:45] place for our lives and it has to be him
[56:49] to minister that place for us otherwise
[56:53] we're looking at how what angle how do I
[56:55] come in to enter this place and we see
[56:57] that even in the Tabernacle in the
[57:00] wilderness there was but one gate there
[57:02] was but one doorway you you just
[57:04] couldn't come in in any other way when
[57:07] you think of it a person could a person
[57:08] have climbed over the wall they could
[57:10] have but it was not God's way God has a
[57:14] way and what it is is that it's not if
[57:17] God doesn't leave it up to us to try to
[57:19] find out what is that way but God's
[57:22] desire and this shows God's heart and
[57:24] his desire is he wants our fellowship so
[57:28] deeply that not only has he made away
[57:31] but he comes down to show us that way
[57:34] and not just show us that way but comes
[57:37] down to guide us in that way that's
[57:40] showing God's heart and God's desires so
[57:43] David is speaking here that this gate of
[57:47] the righteousness now he's asking open
[57:50] this gate of right gates of
[57:52] righteousness unto me so there's a
[57:54] desire and if David is speaking in this
[57:57] manner and we believe with all of our
[57:59] heart this is the Spirit of Christ in
[58:01] David because these scriptures are in
[58:04] truly the inspired Word of God this is
[58:07] not David's thinking when we're reading
[58:09] of these things here in the scriptures
[58:12] we realize that it is the inspiration of
[58:14] the Holy Spirit and if David is speaking
[58:16] open to me the gates of righteousness
[58:19] even to have that request that desire
[58:23] there's something within David that is
[58:25] longing to be in that place and so
[58:28] because there's something within him
[58:30] longing to be in that place he has
[58:33] received
[58:34] something in his life that he could even
[58:37] say open to me he's not approaching
[58:41] something without confidence he has a
[58:43] confidence that those gates of
[58:46] righteousness aren't too open for him
[58:48] but like anything in the economy of God
[58:51] it comes where God deals with our hearts
[58:54] everything that is there for us but it's
[58:56] up to us to take what God has given to
[59:00] us you make it you have to make it your
[59:03] own
[59:03] recognize that yet of all the course of
[59:06] a service when the presence of God comes
[59:08] by with his word when that word is being
[59:10] made a lot no matter how the amount of
[59:12] people that are gathered there when you
[59:14] sense that in your heart you take that
[59:16] very personal that's God confirming his
[59:19] promise for me in my life and you can
[59:22] just at that time say Lord open to me
[59:25] Lord God open to me Lord Jesus so here
[59:35] David is is walking truly in this in
[59:40] this time there's his revelation that
[59:43] has struck in David's heart that he's
[59:46] longing for an entrance into this place
[59:49] and if you notice as we're saying the
[59:53] gates are are given for access for
[59:56] privilege that even when we recognize it
[1:00:02] clear back in the scripture that Israel
[1:00:05] all of Israel knew of the appropriate
[1:00:10] sacrifices they knew of those things but
[1:00:14] God gave out in his word before they
[1:00:16] ever came into the land God let it be
[1:00:18] known there are going to be a distinct
[1:00:21] place where I'm going to place my name
[1:00:24] and God said that where he's placed his
[1:00:28] name that you are to seek after this
[1:00:31] habitation my dwelling place and it's in
[1:00:35] that gate where you are to worship where
[1:00:38] you are to offer the Passover lamb were
[1:00:41] you to be identified in all of Israel
[1:00:44] worse
[1:00:45] to come to that place and a designated
[1:00:49] time of the year now we also know that
[1:00:54] undoubtedly that there were some who did
[1:00:57] not see the significance of worshipping
[1:01:00] in that place they offered the lamb they
[1:01:04] had the same if we can say substance
[1:01:06] that others had it wasn't in them you I
[1:01:09] hope you understand I'm saying you could
[1:01:11] not look down on them and say oh you
[1:01:13] know why aren't you doing this the whole
[1:01:15] economy of God is that you know if that
[1:01:17] is not in the heart of an individual no
[1:01:20] matter how frustrated you are no matter
[1:01:22] how much you look at and say they ought
[1:01:23] to be like this be careful be careful
[1:01:26] that you're not just looking at
[1:01:28] something and it's taking you away from
[1:01:30] worship because remember your strength
[1:01:34] to help them depends on your unity with
[1:01:38] Christ Abraham would have had no power
[1:01:41] to release a lot unless he was first
[1:01:44] separated from lot that's a message on
[1:01:48] its own he's trying to help family but
[1:01:50] you have to be yielded and United with
[1:01:52] Christ in all areas Tyrus before you can
[1:01:56] help your family the right a separated
[1:02:00] life it releases the authority and power
[1:02:03] of God in your life because you're able
[1:02:06] and not tied down and hindered by things
[1:02:08] you're free and if you're free then
[1:02:11] you're able to minister freedom you're
[1:02:14] able to stand and minister a word of
[1:02:16] reconciliation is that right so the gate
[1:02:21] but there were there were those and and
[1:02:23] and you know even in the whole of Israel
[1:02:24] think of how many think of how many when
[1:02:27] the Lord Jesus was here was going to
[1:02:29] Jerusalem because it moved from Shiloh
[1:02:31] to Jerusalem showing that those cities
[1:02:34] listen to me now those cities on the
[1:02:36] earth they were not the D what God
[1:02:39] Himself had in his mind as the final
[1:02:42] resting place they were only places that
[1:02:45] were temporarily where God had
[1:02:47] designated and they would speak of the
[1:02:51] very food nosov Almighty God they're
[1:02:55] right we've seen that with Shiloh
[1:02:57] corruptions that's in Jerusalem
[1:02:59] were corruption sets in but in Christ
[1:03:01] there is no corruption that's why I real
[1:03:06] true experience with God there's no
[1:03:08] corruption in a true experience of God
[1:03:11] because Christ can not corrupt Christ
[1:03:15] has no yes because he had no beginning
[1:03:21] the gate where he chose to place his
[1:03:23] name many as the Prophet tells us were
[1:03:26] coming to worship in Jerusalem many were
[1:03:30] coming to have the Passover he said but
[1:03:32] only a few we're having it with him
[1:03:34] notice how it changed so quickly there
[1:03:37] were many who were who were looking and
[1:03:39] and and looking throughout the time and
[1:03:42] through the ages but notice how it
[1:03:44] narrowed down to such a small minority
[1:03:47] when he came in his fullness when the
[1:03:52] transition was coming it narrowed down
[1:03:54] why it's a headstone time it's a
[1:03:57] Keystone time it's capstone time all
[1:04:01] through the Old Testament there are two
[1:04:03] too precious promises that they were
[1:04:06] looking for they were looking for the
[1:04:08] coming of the Messiah in Redemption and
[1:04:12] they were looking for the outpouring of
[1:04:14] the Holy Ghost because they knew it was
[1:04:20] a witness to them that live the life of
[1:04:23] them that Redeemer his life coming to us
[1:04:26] that speaks that we are in the
[1:04:29] redemption that we are identified and so
[1:04:32] it was a witness and in their lives not
[1:04:35] something that fathers had explained but
[1:04:38] whom God had revealed to them that this
[1:04:41] life and who they really were
[1:04:44] same way in this in the time that even
[1:04:48] we're living in we see it down through
[1:04:50] the the the New Testament where it is
[1:04:54] spoken that Paul would even have the
[1:04:58] sounding out as that first messenger
[1:05:00] Peter look at all of them that are born
[1:05:02] by the Spirit of God the the resonating
[1:05:04] call within their heart is for the
[1:05:07] second coming of the Lord that's what
[1:05:10] the believers
[1:05:12] down through time live for Miss a like
[1:05:16] this it's because of the of the climax
[1:05:21] of the first coming which is the seal of
[1:05:23] the Holy Ghost it threw them into a
[1:05:26] place to where they were looking for the
[1:05:29] second coming of the Lord the Prophet
[1:05:33] tells us they went down to the grave
[1:05:35] running and when they're raised back up
[1:05:37] they come right back up running they
[1:05:40] didn't they they didn't come to a place
[1:05:42] of retirement and I can say spiritually
[1:05:44] I don't want to trouble some of you that
[1:05:46] are retired they never retired
[1:05:51] spiritually they kept pressing that that
[1:05:54] was the goal that was the desire that's
[1:05:56] what kept him going
[1:05:57] when there when when every text and
[1:05:59] trial would come their way
[1:06:00] it was that within them that's maquette
[1:06:03] them moving on brother and sister that's
[1:06:06] the reality within our lives because you
[1:06:09] realize the second coming is not
[1:06:11] something out here the second coming is
[1:06:14] in you yes sir it's God Himself coming
[1:06:19] that has claimed you and His Word is
[1:06:22] calling you out of this world his second
[1:06:27] coming is a claiming it second coming is
[1:06:30] coming to redeem what he had purchased
[1:06:36] is that right it's which it's what they
[1:06:39] live for they're like it's saying like
[1:06:40] this very plainly it's what made them
[1:06:42] tick it's what caused them to say
[1:06:46] they've make this choice about a job or
[1:06:49] that choice about a job you see you see
[1:06:52] what I'm saying
[1:06:52] it was there because this Paul said
[1:06:55] Christ who is our life
[1:06:56] it's what means what it's what we what
[1:06:59] motivated because he was the absolute of
[1:07:03] their life that's what they're living
[1:07:05] for that's what we've always got to be
[1:07:08] mindful that's why the word listen
[1:07:10] friends it's very important that we're
[1:07:11] staying in the word and you're staying
[1:07:13] in prayer it's important that were under
[1:07:15] live ministry it's important because the
[1:07:18] Spirit of God comes back and the Holy
[1:07:20] Ghost comes back brings discernment and
[1:07:23] we're not what it's not the new message
[1:07:25] for the RAM said say what I say it's the
[1:07:29] same holy ghost that game that word
[1:07:30] inspired it it brings it down to where
[1:07:33] you can look at it and you would say my
[1:07:35] goodness it says don't brother random
[1:07:37] was living here it's not brother branham
[1:07:39] it is he which once were chance and
[1:07:41] which is to come is the same angel the
[1:07:44] Lord the same mighty angel that is here
[1:07:48] amen the church is not devoid of angels
[1:07:51] the church is not devoid of the angel of
[1:07:54] the Lord the age of the Lord is still
[1:07:57] here hey he is the man that had clothed
[1:08:03] in fine linen he is the son of man the
[1:08:05] Word made flesh he is a sealing angel
[1:08:12] hallelujah hallelujah what a comfort we
[1:08:15] have in this hour glory be to God
[1:08:21] hallelujah
[1:08:25] so in David his speaks to this and I
[1:08:29] saved the clothes in our lives you know
[1:08:33] God knew we were gonna live in this time
[1:08:38] he knew this he knew the conditions of
[1:08:41] this age God knew it and God has
[1:08:46] provided that even by virtue of the seed
[1:08:50] that is within you which is the housing
[1:08:54] of his own life but that seed when it's
[1:08:56] quickened by his quickening power it
[1:08:59] raises up that is greater is He that is
[1:09:02] in you than he that's in the world
[1:09:04] [Applause]
[1:09:06] that's why John never had to write out a
[1:09:08] list of sin he never had to write out a
[1:09:11] list of thing whosoever is born of God
[1:09:13] overcometh the world even our faith
[1:09:19] notice David said open to me the gates
[1:09:23] of righteousness I want to mention here
[1:09:25] this this point very to me a very
[1:09:31] tremendous statement the brother branham
[1:09:32] makes in Makassar dick the great prince
[1:09:34] and king he said there's three elements
[1:09:37] that a man follows first is humanistic
[1:09:41] second is divine revelation third a
[1:09:44] vision that's thus saith the Lord many
[1:09:48] times we are down in here and never
[1:09:51] climb into this if you're not down in
[1:09:55] there cast your hopes through that veil
[1:09:58] up here - thus saith the Lord
[1:10:01] now notice cast your hopes through that
[1:10:05] veil up here - thus saith the Lord
[1:10:09] here's David standing here open to me
[1:10:12] the gates of righteousness what's David
[1:10:15] doing
[1:10:16] he's casting he's casting his hopes
[1:10:21] through that veil appear - thus saith
[1:10:24] the Lord hopes not a bad thing as long
[1:10:32] as it has the leadership of faith faith
[1:10:37] and hope a husband and wife I'm not
[1:10:39] gonna preach on that today it's
[1:10:41] wonderful it's a if it's united
[1:10:43] correctly they're right faith is a big
[1:10:45] burly guy hope is a timid you both say
[1:10:51] you don't know my wife
[1:10:52] [Laughter]
[1:10:55] but what has to join the two together
[1:10:57] love right that's a separate message
[1:11:06] though you don't see the vision though
[1:11:11] the revelation doesn't come but when
[1:11:14] you're praying for you say I just wish I
[1:11:16] could believe that doesn't make any
[1:11:20] difference how won't you listen his
[1:11:24] council cast your anchor down there and
[1:11:27] call it so anyhow but saying I would
[1:11:34] believe it God revealed it to me though
[1:11:37] you don't see the vision though the
[1:11:40] revelation doesn't come though when
[1:11:43] you're praying for you say I just wished
[1:11:46] I could believe that doesn't make any
[1:11:50] difference you know if this is this is a
[1:11:54] prophetic eye that's separating you from
[1:11:57] you hey man it is letting you know that
[1:12:02] your mind is not your strength that I am
[1:12:05] your strength
[1:12:07] I have confirmed the wire to you you
[1:12:11] know you're one of my children so what
[1:12:13] do you do cast your hopes cast your
[1:12:17] hopes through the veil there and say God
[1:12:19] has said it the devil can say hadn't
[1:12:23] been revealed to you yet well you
[1:12:24] haven't seen a vision about it yet but
[1:12:26] God said it
[1:12:29] hallelujah and the Prophet tells us in
[1:12:32] the message perfect faith he said when
[1:12:34] God he said even a vision that can speak
[1:12:36] he said but what God has said here is
[1:12:38] more sure than the vision because the
[1:12:42] vision cannot speak contrary to the word
[1:12:45] amen what does it do what's the whole
[1:12:48] ministry is to put faith in the word
[1:12:51] that God keeps his word and to claim
[1:12:53] that word for our own hallelujah signs
[1:13:01] and wonders in the ministry all those
[1:13:03] things are but none even when God will
[1:13:05] pass far away a miracle and things are
[1:13:08] done in your life what is that to do
[1:13:10] just take your life faith sometimes we
[1:13:14] need a jumpstart
[1:13:21] well said no I don't when they come up
[1:13:23] here and pray for you get that line
[1:13:26] clogged off of you it's shorting out
[1:13:30] everything when the end we need that for
[1:13:33] them I'm not talking about an
[1:13:34] up-and-down life I'm not talking about a
[1:13:36] life without victory you know better
[1:13:38] than that I'm talking about to where the
[1:13:40] Word of God when it's coming down and
[1:13:43] moving in our life there are times where
[1:13:45] the Spirit of God we need that alignment
[1:13:47] in our lives
[1:13:51] Paul said I want die daily
[1:13:58] part of our recharging is dining daily
[1:14:04] some of you get that one tomorrow
[1:14:07] but watch this the Scriptures notice how
[1:14:11] in the book of Hebrews it speaks to the
[1:14:13] believers Penant identifies as Pilgrims
[1:14:18] and strangers they were aware of this
[1:14:21] city if you're a pilgrim and a stranger
[1:14:26] it speaks that you're not a resident of
[1:14:30] that place where you are my brother can
[1:14:37] attest to this right brother Bill's over
[1:14:38] the different ones they said you go to
[1:14:40] some of the places that checkpoints and
[1:14:41] them in airports and things like that
[1:14:43] and they said and they can tell you
[1:14:45] things in I can tell you from America
[1:14:46] why Bill Simmons because you're white or
[1:14:49] whatever more more white people than
[1:14:51] just in America you know hey you know
[1:14:54] the reason they say that because you
[1:14:55] walk proud now don't take it wrong I'm
[1:15:01] not gonna start crawling how I'm not
[1:15:03] talking about false humility but you see
[1:15:06] it's something that they can kind of
[1:15:07] tell it's just like this you know
[1:15:09] sometimes when you're over we lived over
[1:15:10] in Sandusky and you'd see people coming
[1:15:12] down the road from a distance I don't
[1:15:13] know their face I can't see him I don't
[1:15:15] know if they're from here or not but I
[1:15:16] start seeing and walking around with
[1:15:17] backpacks I know
[1:15:19] foreigner because we don't walk around
[1:15:22] with backpacks here and carrying bags
[1:15:24] around behind us and walking into malls
[1:15:26] and doing shopping but bags behind us
[1:15:28] like this suitcases I know they're
[1:15:30] either European or from some other
[1:15:32] country I know that just by looking I
[1:15:34] don't have to ask them I know
[1:15:42] their manner gives them away that's why
[1:15:48] the token is not what we talked about
[1:15:51] the token is to be on display at all
[1:15:55] times the Bible didn't say they called
[1:16:00] themselves Christians it says that's
[1:16:01] what they were called first at Antioch
[1:16:05] if it was their life is that right
[1:16:08] so pilgrims and strangers it's that life
[1:16:11] that has moved into them to where
[1:16:13] Abraham and the rest were walking and
[1:16:15] among here within this life but God
[1:16:18] moves upon the hearts and they recognize
[1:16:22] this is not the world that I am of so
[1:16:28] they begin to move in separation from
[1:16:30] that world this is where the scripture
[1:16:32] says in Hebrews 11:10 for he looked for
[1:16:37] a city which hath foundations whose
[1:16:40] builder and maker is God this was not
[1:16:47] speaking of an earthly City Abraham met
[1:16:53] the king and priest of this city
[1:16:58] that's what through Abraham into a place
[1:17:01] of looking for the city
[1:17:04] Abraham listen now Abraham spiritual
[1:17:07] he's not looking for something upon this
[1:17:09] earth it is something that he's moved
[1:17:12] that he's looking beyond this earthly
[1:17:14] realm but he recognizes after meeting
[1:17:17] God in this manner he recognized that he
[1:17:21] can come and appear at any moment he
[1:17:24] recognizes there's a place that's more
[1:17:27] real than this place and he's looking
[1:17:31] for it his life declares he's looking
[1:17:36] for something you know you come in your
[1:17:38] house your wife your husband or somebody
[1:17:40] you know what you looking for you
[1:17:41] waiting for
[1:17:43] I can't find this sir I can't find that
[1:17:45] honey you know where my keys are at
[1:17:47] honey you know where this honey you know
[1:17:48] I'm looking there's something that you
[1:17:51] now belongs to you you're looking for it
[1:17:54] there was something that registered in
[1:17:57] Abraham's heart this same something
[1:18:00] registered in every son and daughter of
[1:18:04] Abraham and this same thing registers in
[1:18:08] the heart of every son and daughter of
[1:18:09] Abraham this day a city notice a city a
[1:18:16] city looking for a city because when he
[1:18:20] revealed himself notice how Paul takes
[1:18:23] this let me let me just read this real
[1:18:24] quick this is it beautiful I love this
[1:18:28] Hebrews chapter 7 verse 1 you see it's
[1:18:32] evident if we look from Genesis 14 then
[1:18:35] we go to Hebrews 7 it's evident it's not
[1:18:38] an earthly Salem or Jerusalem but it's
[1:18:43] another it's that which is true notice
[1:18:48] how Paul brings this verse 1 for this
[1:18:50] Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the
[1:18:53] Most High God who met Abraham returning
[1:18:57] from the slaughter of the Kings and
[1:18:58] blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a
[1:19:03] tenth part of all-first
[1:19:06] being by interpretation king of
[1:19:09] righteousness and after that also king
[1:19:12] of Salem which is king of peace notice
[1:19:16] how Paul notice look at these eyes that
[1:19:19] are looking in here he establishes first
[1:19:22] he's known as king of righteousness this
[1:19:27] is Ali's non-first yet in the scripture
[1:19:29] it does not say a rightness as king of
[1:19:31] Salem back in Genesis 14 18 but a
[1:19:34] prophetic eye recognizes this is he who
[1:19:37] is righteousness he will never have
[1:19:41] father mother beginning or ending of
[1:19:42] days this is not self-made righteousness
[1:19:45] this is not somebody who's made them
[1:19:47] self righteous this is he who is
[1:19:50] righteous altogether amen he reveals
[1:19:55] himself that he is the very
[1:19:57] righteousness of God and it's imperative
[1:20:01] first being right so first interpreted
[1:20:04] as being team of righteousness
[1:20:07] he's not a product of he is the very
[1:20:11] fountain of righteousness he's the very
[1:20:13] faction of life he's not a product of PC
[1:20:17] is the very fountain he is king of Salem
[1:20:20] he is king of peace you can't have peace
[1:20:25] without having righteousness is that
[1:20:28] right there is no peace without
[1:20:30] righteousness but when you receive the
[1:20:32] righteousness of God or and let me say
[1:20:34] the righteousness of God when you've
[1:20:36] recognized it and it moves to receive
[1:20:38] you into it by the Holy Ghost then you
[1:20:41] have peace and who do you have reigning
[1:20:45] in your life the king of righteousness
[1:20:46] and the king of peace because he gave
[1:20:52] something to Abraham what Abraham needed
[1:20:56] bread and wine is that right he steps
[1:21:01] forward after the great battle of
[1:21:02] Calvary and his giving of his own
[1:21:04] substance he's so nice
[1:21:07] on the return from the battle and he's
[1:21:10] imparting this he's giving it to Abraham
[1:21:12] I tell you that I love this person it's
[1:21:15] hard for me to just not move on I love
[1:21:17] this place and Scripture I love all
[1:21:19] Scripture I I feel like you know when
[1:21:21] you read in psalm 118 I was reading a
[1:21:24] little part where Martin Luther said I
[1:21:25] love all the scripture he said but this
[1:21:27] song right here Psalms 118 has been my
[1:21:30] greatest encouragement when I've been
[1:21:32] locked up he said when Kings and
[1:21:34] everything else have stood against me I
[1:21:36] have Rick came back and read this
[1:21:38] scripture found comfort from the Word of
[1:21:42] God we look at this here with
[1:21:43] Melchizedek he's revealing himself
[1:21:45] before Abraham gets back home and he's
[1:21:52] letting it this is very clear it is not
[1:21:54] I he's not the king of just a bit
[1:21:58] actually Jerusalem but it is the king of
[1:22:01] love that Jerusalem which the Scriptures
[1:22:04] speak to us
[1:22:05] it's that holy city of God that New
[1:22:08] Jerusalem all those others were it was
[1:22:11] in type and shadow and prefigure and and
[1:22:14] truly here God will move down even in
[1:22:17] that time and dwelling
[1:22:18] coming upon that part of land but
[1:22:20] remember it is that holy city that New
[1:22:23] Jerusalem and within that city there are
[1:22:28] delegates that already know a delegate
[1:22:33] to a city on a council or whatever more
[1:22:35] is an elected position is that right you
[1:22:40] just can't walk in you better not walk
[1:22:42] into your local council mean and say hi
[1:22:44] by the way I've gotten a secret agenda
[1:22:45] here they'll escort you out
[1:22:47] is that right where's your wedding
[1:22:50] garment where's your token who gave you
[1:22:56] the authority well I'm part of the city
[1:22:58] but there's a way to come in the votes
[1:23:04] were already cast on our behalf we were
[1:23:09] already elected chosen for deigned and
[1:23:13] God God has brought us into this place
[1:23:15] listen now by the Spirit of God dwelling
[1:23:18] in our lives it brings us to a place to
[1:23:20] where we live now as if we were there we
[1:23:26] live now as if we were already in that
[1:23:28] city why because it's the character of
[1:23:32] that life that so changes it Orient's
[1:23:36] our lives to where it sets the order in
[1:23:38] us to match the order of that city now
[1:23:44] watch how that this great parallel of
[1:23:46] the resurrection and coming into the
[1:23:48] place of looking at the fault now raised
[1:23:51] up and ready for rapture resurrection
[1:23:55] precedes the rapture and we realized
[1:23:59] that the resurrection precedes the
[1:24:02] rapture let's look at her here just a
[1:24:03] little bit in Matthew 27 verse 51 this
[1:24:07] is the place that the Prophet would
[1:24:08] would read from here and the message the
[1:24:10] rapture I'm not going to read the
[1:24:13] entirety of it but I'll just refer to
[1:24:15] just these three first three verses and
[1:24:18] behold the veil of the temple was rent
[1:24:19] in twain from the top to the bottom and
[1:24:21] the earth did quake in the rocks rent
[1:24:24] and the graves were opened and many
[1:24:27] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[1:24:31] I'll tell you that that word slept has
[1:24:34] become more precious to me it has it's
[1:24:37] become more precious to me day after day
[1:24:40] after day it just it stands out just
[1:24:43] like a billboard in the midst of the
[1:24:44] Scriptures sleeping they're resting
[1:24:48] they're waiting they're enjoying
[1:24:52] themselves right now but they are
[1:24:54] waiting they're arresting they're not
[1:24:55] dead they're just sleeping Oh Maude hmm
[1:25:01] and came out of the graves after his
[1:25:06] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:25:09] and appeared unto many you see didn't
[1:25:14] notice it didn't say when they came out
[1:25:15] of the graves they went all over Israel
[1:25:18] and said they went into the holy city in
[1:25:22] that day they were living and walking in
[1:25:24] the place that God ordained for them to
[1:25:26] be in so when it came time for the
[1:25:29] resurrection supporting their life death
[1:25:31] does not change you buddy with me that
[1:25:35] doesn't change you when they were raised
[1:25:37] up out of the grave they went right into
[1:25:38] the holy a blue-ray then they knew
[1:25:44] where to go I want you to see how that
[1:25:51] the Spirit of God because we're not just
[1:25:54] we don't look at this book as the Bible
[1:25:56] as a book just of history it's a book of
[1:26:00] prophecy
[1:26:01] we know that the events that are laid
[1:26:03] out there clearly idiots of prophesy and
[1:26:06] it's the same spirit of God that makes
[1:26:09] real what he has prophesied and he
[1:26:12] confirms to you and I that when I
[1:26:14] portrayed this or when I spoke this you
[1:26:17] were in my thinking the parallel right
[1:26:22] here this resurrection that we've been
[1:26:24] dealing with for months this time it's a
[1:26:27] parallel of the rapture Jesus here after
[1:26:34] descending down taking the sin
[1:26:38] depositing
[1:26:40] coming back up he comes and is upon the
[1:26:44] earth for 40 days there right but he's
[1:26:49] only with his elect for 40 days it's all
[1:26:54] right it's a parallel the rapture
[1:27:00] because he was buried and raised first
[1:27:08] there right many scriptures come to your
[1:27:11] mind in your heart as a Bible reader
[1:27:13] he's the firstfruits of all those that
[1:27:16] slept when he came sleeping time was
[1:27:23] over glory be to God
[1:27:30] hard to keep still here they were
[1:27:34] resting in the promise they were
[1:27:38] sleeping they were resting in the
[1:27:40] promise when they laid down their lives
[1:27:42] they were resting in the promise even
[1:27:46] though to them may be the clarity I'm
[1:27:50] now gonna say one reveal because we know
[1:27:51] it was revealed by faith how can it be
[1:27:54] how can it be without revelation and
[1:27:56] then faith it has to be that part that
[1:27:59] is revealed to them that is necessary
[1:28:02] for the hour they're living in because
[1:28:05] God reveals what's necessary and needed
[1:28:08] for the hour we're living in and what he
[1:28:11] reveals is himself his life so that it
[1:28:14] is him receiving glory unto himself
[1:28:17] because it's him that's doing the work
[1:28:20] is that right he gives you an either
[1:28:23] strength to stand in the hour where
[1:28:25] we're to stand the Hebrew children this
[1:28:28] is an example we read they could have
[1:28:30] lived in the realm of humanistic but
[1:28:33] there was not revealed to them what God
[1:28:35] was going to do in the furnace they did
[1:28:38] see a vision now listen to me what if
[1:28:41] their faith now I want you to think of
[1:28:43] this very clearly what if their faith
[1:28:46] was only only based on Lord you're gonna
[1:28:49] have to reveal to me
[1:28:51] what's gonna happen in this fiery
[1:28:52] furnace first of all we've got it wrong
[1:28:57] you don't have to do in it he don't owe
[1:29:03] us nothing no you're gonna have to show
[1:29:07] me a vision maybe God wants us to walk
[1:29:11] by hey trusting him you know what I'm
[1:29:18] talking about sometimes there's been
[1:29:19] things in your life that's just been as
[1:29:20] clear as the mayonnaise on a bologna
[1:29:23] sandwich and then there's other times
[1:29:24] when there's things has just not been
[1:29:25] clear at all and you almost have what I
[1:29:29] trust Lord and you know it's you know I
[1:29:32] don't want to say fear but you're in a
[1:29:33] place because you realize how great it
[1:29:36] is to be in God's wheel how important it
[1:29:38] is to be in the will of God do you
[1:29:40] realize that can you End us and put you
[1:29:42] in desperation what is that
[1:29:44] that's not unbelief that you sing Lord I
[1:29:46] want my steps to claim your Lord I want
[1:29:50] you to be pleased you are your
[1:29:55] consideration is of him of his work and
[1:29:57] not of your wants so we were looking at
[1:30:05] this here the Hebrew children they come
[1:30:07] instead they come and say listen we
[1:30:09] don't know if God's gonna deliver us or
[1:30:11] not
[1:30:11] we don't know if our God's gonna deliver
[1:30:13] how can you stand with faith they were
[1:30:16] standing in who they knew God was to
[1:30:20] them and who they were having done all
[1:30:24] to stand stand when I stand on stand on
[1:30:29] who God has said you are
[1:30:31] well you don't know how to stand like
[1:30:34] shamrock Shangaan didn't know exactly
[1:30:36] what to do but he reached back and he
[1:30:38] realized I'm a son of Abraham
[1:30:39] he felt that covenant it's like when
[1:30:42] Samson was talh think about it all of
[1:30:44] the demons that were gathered around him
[1:30:46] and said you can't rise up you can't be
[1:30:48] restored you can't have this but Samson
[1:30:51] he got to sensing that those locks had
[1:30:54] broke back out oh my head come into that
[1:30:56] place and he said Lord just once more he
[1:30:59] called for a land not a big growth
[1:31:03] something of theology he called for
[1:31:06] simplicity what was the lad it was a
[1:31:09] tight there even of the lamb leading the
[1:31:12] dad leading moving into that place of
[1:31:15] the pillars the right they cast their
[1:31:21] hopes in the vaillar
[1:31:25] the simplicity of a life to walk back
[1:31:28] into that I listen friends I'll tell you
[1:31:31] very clearly I would love to have every
[1:31:33] single time that everything is such a
[1:31:34] clear revelation that lays out every
[1:31:39] part and you can sitting there well yeah
[1:31:45] I'm gonna go here today but God's
[1:31:47] already told me what's gonna happen so
[1:31:48] we're gonna go ahead and go through with
[1:31:49] it you know we would lack such faith in
[1:31:53] such trust you know what we'd end up
[1:31:55] doing well I know how this is gonna come
[1:31:57] out anyhow I wonder what brother
[1:31:58] so-and-so is doing whereas when we don't
[1:32:02] know the exact outcome sometimes our
[1:32:05] hearts thought comes in it Lord you're
[1:32:10] my feet about that time then you get a
[1:32:13] text I'm praying for you brother yeah
[1:32:17] thank you think I need that prayer right
[1:32:20] now well we're at a time of Prayer
[1:32:31] well let's get back here
[1:32:39] the Scripture speaks of the victorious
[1:32:42] March home but I want to just I'm gonna
[1:32:44] skip those scriptures we'll get to those
[1:32:46] the next time I want to go right into
[1:32:48] the message the rapture brother ram
[1:32:54] takes us here he says if you read in
[1:32:56] Matthew 18 16 there is three that bear
[1:32:59] record first John 5:7 so forth three is
[1:33:04] always a witness
[1:33:05] it's a verification something that's
[1:33:06] right it's three witnesses bear in the
[1:33:09] mouth of two or three witnesses let
[1:33:11] every word be established
[1:33:12] now notice we've had three witnesses
[1:33:15] three is a witness now we have already
[1:33:17] had three raptures in the Old Testament
[1:33:19] did you know that as a witness
[1:33:22] watch Enoch was one Elijah was the other
[1:33:24] one and Jesus was the other one Jesus
[1:33:28] being the Keystone now he bear record he
[1:33:32] was the keystone between the old and new
[1:33:35] Testament because he had to first die
[1:33:38] and then rapture he died come to life
[1:33:42] and walked around here with us and then
[1:33:45] was raptured up because he was the
[1:33:47] keystone that tied the two together
[1:33:53] after his resurrection and rapture
[1:33:56] notice Jesus had a resurrection and
[1:34:04] after his resurrection he was raptured
[1:34:13] after he didn't prove that the Old
[1:34:16] Testament there we all know that Enoch
[1:34:18] was translated we know Elijah was taken
[1:34:20] in by world and then right in a chariot
[1:34:22] of fire and Jesus died buried rose up
[1:34:25] and lived here on earth then was
[1:34:27] raptured to Keystone let me read that
[1:34:29] one more time
[1:34:30] whew I love it when he comes by like
[1:34:34] that I might have had it highlighted
[1:34:35] here but he came by with some different
[1:34:37] ink
[1:34:39] and Jesus died buried and rose up and
[1:34:45] lived here on earth and Dan was raptured
[1:34:48] up the Keystone that is the hole of a
[1:34:51] life of a believer we must die to
[1:34:58] ourselves
[1:34:59] he was seen except the seat fall in the
[1:35:02] ground and die in luck and Barrett hit
[1:35:04] Vytas alone
[1:35:05] but as his death base died its buried
[1:35:08] but once it's better he can be raised up
[1:35:11] again and when he was raised up he
[1:35:14] walked around here on earth in a
[1:35:17] resurrected condition and you who were
[1:35:22] once dead in sin and trespasses half he
[1:35:27] quickened resurrected not this yet yes
[1:35:34] this gets it at the rapture but right
[1:35:37] now on the inside it's gotta be a
[1:35:40] resurrection it's gotta be raised up so
[1:35:43] you're ready for rapture
[1:35:48] what's Jesus doing hey the wife is a
[1:35:51] reflection of the husband he's given the
[1:35:54] reflection of his wife the works that I
[1:35:57] do shall she do also hallelujah oh my oh
[1:36:04] he goes on to say he says one rapture is
[1:36:07] past three has happened in the Old
[1:36:10] Testament of them prepared who the word
[1:36:13] of the Lord come to the word of the Lord
[1:36:17] came to Enoch the word of the Lord came
[1:36:19] to Elijah his prophet the word of the
[1:36:22] Lord was Jesus notice the word of the
[1:36:26] Lord was coming to them but he came a
[1:36:28] time when the word of the Lord Himself
[1:36:32] came personally not just a part but the
[1:36:37] fullness of who he was and when he came
[1:36:40] in his fullness that is a keystone that
[1:36:43] is a time of transition that is
[1:36:45] transitioning from
[1:36:46] all to the new that is a time of
[1:36:49] transition exodus out of the church age
[1:36:51] and into the bride age it's a time of
[1:36:53] transition exodus out of this world who
[1:36:59] is the key he is the key the key he who
[1:37:06] the builders have said it not all along
[1:37:10] God exalted and he hath made the head of
[1:37:15] the corner this is the Lord's doing and
[1:37:17] it is marvelous in our eyes black Peter
[1:37:20] said he to us this capstone this
[1:37:22] headstock is most precious oh yes sir
[1:37:28] we're not just talking about a thought
[1:37:29] he is most precious because he has
[1:37:31] ransomed us can I go on watching the Old
[1:37:38] Testament them Old Testament Saints now
[1:37:41] when this rapture first taken place his
[1:37:44] loud voice awakened the Old Testament
[1:37:46] Saints just exactly like the loud voice
[1:37:48] it waken Lazarus the loud voice awakened
[1:37:52] the libram goes into first Thessalonians
[1:37:56] chapter 4 let me continue to read here
[1:38:01] the Old Testament Saints has gone into
[1:38:08] his presence paradise is done away
[1:38:15] Abraham's bosom
[1:38:19] those who were waiting and resting in
[1:38:23] the promise that were walking under the
[1:38:30] same inspiration that God had given to
[1:38:34] Abraham it wasn't because that they were
[1:38:38] flesh of Abraham because remember Esau
[1:38:42] could look back and say Abraham is my
[1:38:46] great-great grandfather so it wasn't my
[1:38:49] flesh paul establish it's not children
[1:38:51] of the flesh that are the promise but
[1:38:54] it's the children of the promise so when
[1:38:59] God was speaking the word to Abraham it
[1:39:01] was God's promise God's thought God's
[1:39:04] provision and noticed this they were
[1:39:10] waiting they'll just keep that in mind
[1:39:12] here they are they're waiting they're
[1:39:14] resting they're waiting in Paradise
[1:39:17] they've been offering up the lamb they
[1:39:21] are resting with a perfect confidence
[1:39:23] that he's coming and the Old Testament
[1:39:29] Saints ascended up at his loud voice
[1:39:32] when he screamed and give up the ghost
[1:39:35] because why the sacrifice the
[1:39:38] perpetuation of their sins that they had
[1:39:40] waited on believing that perfect lamb
[1:39:43] was coming they had offered the
[1:39:45] sacrifice the lamb and when he died and
[1:39:49] yielded up the ghost he screamed with
[1:39:51] the loud voice and the Old Testament
[1:39:53] Saints awoke watch the shout and the
[1:39:57] voiceover hear the same thing at his
[1:40:00] coming
[1:40:01] yielded up the ghost and when he did the
[1:40:03] sacrifice was perfect and paradise
[1:40:06] emptied out and the Old Testament Saints
[1:40:08] came to the earth again and walked
[1:40:10] around on earth and entered in with him
[1:40:13] at his rapture
[1:40:23] so on Calvary the scriptures as it
[1:40:29] speaks to us in Matthew 27 I believe
[1:40:31] it's verse 45 we needed yielded up the
[1:40:33] ghost he cried with a loud voice it is
[1:40:38] finished they who were there in paradise
[1:40:47] they heard that voice when the sender
[1:40:53] was at the natural voice I don't know
[1:40:56] but I do know this and can stand very
[1:40:58] firm on this what they did here was the
[1:41:01] spiritual voice of God issuing out at
[1:41:05] the fulfillment of the word hey man that
[1:41:10] was that voice that they heard there was
[1:41:12] something they knew this is the
[1:41:14] fulfillment it's like when you're
[1:41:21] inviting somebody to your house you hear
[1:41:26] a card pull up and you look out and you
[1:41:27] go yes you come to the window oh no it's
[1:41:31] nothing you go sit back down you don't
[1:41:39] stay here another car neighbors
[1:41:46] you're doing that because you're
[1:41:49] expecting one when that when his voice
[1:41:55] when it sounded up but lost his voice
[1:41:58] hitless that was the fulfillment of
[1:42:01] prophecy I'm telling you he closed them
[1:42:04] all to get up and begin to look through
[1:42:07] the door I don't know how they all seen
[1:42:10] through but they all seen through you're
[1:42:13] just like they had their place in the
[1:42:14] world they knew exactly where to be
[1:42:16] standing because why they knew this is
[1:42:19] the fulfillment one they had waited on
[1:42:21] one they had long gone they were
[1:42:23] gathered around said hey we're getting
[1:42:25] out of here today it's time to go it's
[1:42:29] time to leave hey man Daniel said there
[1:42:34] he is there's that rock Ezekiel today is
[1:42:37] the wheel in the middle of whale day he
[1:42:39] was identified what he was to them and
[1:42:42] that day he still was to them and so
[1:42:45] much more
[1:42:47] amen glory be to God that voice raised
[1:42:54] something up within them and the Lord
[1:42:58] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:43:01] shout he had descended with a shaft a
[1:43:05] message hey man is not listen it's not a
[1:43:10] natural voice it's God's voice there is
[1:43:16] to me we could hear the natural voice
[1:43:18] and not hear God's voice but it's
[1:43:21] hearing God's voice and God's voice
[1:43:24] that's his voice his spirit that still
[1:43:27] has it speaking what does it do it
[1:43:30] assembles his children not to agree not
[1:43:33] to a dogma not to a personality not to a
[1:43:37] church he'd assembled his children unto
[1:43:39] himself this is the scripture in the
[1:43:43] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:43:46] shall gather all things together unto
[1:43:49] himself both things are in heaven and
[1:43:52] things are in earth this is a time
[1:43:55] full reconciliation there right not just
[1:43:59] reconciling here on earth but it's
[1:44:01] reconciling and bringing all things
[1:44:03] together he who is the supreme sacrifice
[1:44:10] who shed his blood who gave his life for
[1:44:14] ransom who laid down his life for his
[1:44:19] wife has been collecting his thoughts
[1:44:24] down through the ages and the shout has
[1:44:30] gone forth shout together the people
[1:44:33] unto himself it gathers you that voice
[1:44:37] it draws you out of barriers that were
[1:44:41] set up in denominations is that right
[1:44:44] what was it it was something you heard
[1:44:47] that had a greater hold and meaning to
[1:44:50] you a stronger tie then no matter how
[1:44:54] long you had been your parents and
[1:44:55] generations being in a certain church or
[1:44:57] a certain thing it was something that
[1:44:59] had a greater call because there was a
[1:45:02] genealogy that you're a part of that
[1:45:06] goes way deeper that was before there
[1:45:10] was angels star the smaller so here as a
[1:45:19] people raised up the Lord Himself is not
[1:45:24] a part this is the Lord Himself he who
[1:45:28] went to minister behind the veil has
[1:45:31] come out to declare in this our full
[1:45:36] justification to declare that what was
[1:45:40] him behind the veil and you were hearing
[1:45:42] the tingling tingling but now he worthy
[1:45:48] is the Lamb who was slain to receive
[1:45:53] riches glory honor and power who is it
[1:45:56] that is declaring that you
[1:45:59] you and me are declaring that we are
[1:46:07] witnesses in that he is the astronaut
[1:46:14] that we are seated in is that right
[1:46:18] so they without us should not be made
[1:46:22] perfect they couldn't go anywhere
[1:46:27] without us because I'm a part I'm a part
[1:46:35] you're a part is that right
[1:46:40] it couldn't go but now when that word
[1:46:44] has that word is having its way in our
[1:46:47] life remember as the Prophet speaks to
[1:46:51] us power residing and moving into the
[1:46:55] bride of Jesus Christ that'll draw those
[1:47:01] what is that
[1:47:02] that's that voice but it's not me or you
[1:47:06] going out to the grave and saying rise
[1:47:08] up
[1:47:09] it's the sounding of prophecy in us it's
[1:47:14] walking in that word just as him he when
[1:47:18] that word was fulfilled it resonated
[1:47:21] down through there and they knew this is
[1:47:23] the time this is the time this is the
[1:47:27] moment all right so we know this to be
[1:47:32] this Holy Ghost the Prophet makes it
[1:47:39] very clear and the rising in the Sun he
[1:47:40] says this coming of the Holy Ghost is
[1:47:43] the abstract to the title deed this is
[1:47:48] not just a portion this is the Lord
[1:47:50] Himself this is not just a dip this is
[1:47:54] the very the fullness of God coming down
[1:47:57] moving right among us what's he doing he
[1:47:59] himself does lean out his word down
[1:48:02] through the ages he's not come with just
[1:48:04] aim one revelation one mystery this is
[1:48:07] the tang of
[1:48:08] all loose ends unto himself hey man he
[1:48:13] is assembling all things unto himself he
[1:48:17] men and the Holy Spirit coming down in
[1:48:20] the abstract they mend the form of the
[1:48:22] world what does it do it's taking away
[1:48:24] every claim and every hole that the
[1:48:27] enemy ever had upon your life hey man
[1:48:30] that's the coming of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:32] it's breaking away every claim what does
[1:48:35] it do
[1:48:35] so Satan no longer has a voice he no
[1:48:41] longer has the voice in revelations
[1:48:46] finds no voice what was he is he speak
[1:48:54] this mighty angel as a lion what's his
[1:49:08] pride hey man and we know his voice
[1:49:18] there already been a god hallelujah it's
[1:49:23] an abstract there's nothing can rise
[1:49:25] against this title in a previous age
[1:49:29] Satan could arose and said you can't go
[1:49:31] cuz you got my water baptism they're
[1:49:35] right Satan had things he could he could
[1:49:37] enforce and say the titles not fully
[1:49:39] cleaned and cleaned and cleared but the
[1:49:42] Holy Ghost coming 30 years the deed
[1:49:45] making it real making it live restoring
[1:49:49] what was lost clearing out things that
[1:49:52] we're you know people look at me they
[1:49:54] could argue dis bait and presume and
[1:49:56] flats and whatever more but the Holy
[1:49:57] Spirit Himself the fullness we're not in
[1:50:00] this debating when I'm in this fussing
[1:50:01] that's not how God works God comes down
[1:50:03] and he personally vindicates with his
[1:50:06] presence he comes down and confirms his
[1:50:09] word and makes it real and alive by
[1:50:12] projecting it and moving in our lives
[1:50:16] amen were not under theology this is the
[1:50:20] very presence of the Living God that's
[1:50:22] changing you and I creating within us a
[1:50:26] faith to move we call this the earnest
[1:50:34] the right the Scriptures speak this is
[1:50:36] the earnest and the earnest is your
[1:50:41] assurance yes sir
[1:50:45] it's not you putting down downpayment
[1:50:48] God gave you the downpayment God said
[1:50:53] this is the deposit to let you know that
[1:50:56] where you are from and when you know
[1:50:59] where you're from you know where you're
[1:51:00] going hallelujah what's he doing he's
[1:51:06] more removing all the obstacles how is
[1:51:09] he removing all the obstacles by showing
[1:51:11] you who you are that's how God deals
[1:51:15] with sin by revealing himself to you and
[1:51:18] revealing who you are that's how he
[1:51:20] deals with sin they men by his presence
[1:51:26] it's person coming and dealing in our
[1:51:28] lives moving in our lives revealing
[1:51:30] himself personally upon this revelation
[1:51:34] of who he is I'll build my church and
[1:51:39] the gates of hell this is that lively
[1:51:46] hope that Peter spoke of he hath
[1:51:49] begotten us into a lively hope is that
[1:51:54] right oh my that's why Paul could say if
[1:51:58] this same spirit that raised up Christ
[1:52:02] Jesus from the dead dwell in you it
[1:52:06] shall also quicken your mortal body
[1:52:13] identifying this scripture that that is
[1:52:16] and was for you this is why when you
[1:52:24] have received the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost
[1:52:27] has received you you have been raised up
[1:52:30] and you're ready for rapture like to
[1:52:38] walk me all aboard there's no big eyes a
[1:52:46] little use from we're all the same class
[1:52:52] refreshments are coming down the cabin
[1:52:58] though they be to God hallelujah Oman in
[1:53:04] who is this Melchizedek let me read this
[1:53:06] in closing all he says you women you
[1:53:08] claiming you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:53:10] going out here and wearing shorts and
[1:53:11] things how could you do it how could the
[1:53:13] Spirit of God and you ever let you do
[1:53:15] such a thing as that it just can't be so
[1:53:17] certainly it can be he's not a filthy
[1:53:20] spirit he's a Holy Spirit and then when
[1:53:22] you become subject to that spirit it
[1:53:25] throws your whole being subject to that
[1:53:29] spirit and that spirit is nothing in the
[1:53:32] world but the seed word made manifest or
[1:53:35] quickened hallelujah made alive and when
[1:53:38] the Bible said don't do this that body
[1:53:40] quickly turns to it there is no question
[1:53:44] who and what is it
[1:53:48] it's the earnest of the resurrection
[1:53:52] this body will be raised up again
[1:53:55] because it's already started
[1:53:59] hey man raised up ready for rapture it
[1:54:07] was one subject to sin and mire and
[1:54:10] corruption but now it's got the earnest
[1:54:12] it's turned heaven not turn to a church
[1:54:18] that's wonderful friends if you're
[1:54:20] realizing God's dealing with your life
[1:54:22] and you're coming here send him the word
[1:54:23] but remember I'm telling you this in the
[1:54:25] name of the Lord that it's not right so
[1:54:26] ready you have got to move in and come
[1:54:29] under the blood Amen it's got to be
[1:54:32] where your life is hidden away in under
[1:54:35] the blood and listen that's the call of
[1:54:37] the hour get under the blood it's not
[1:54:41] enough to know about the message it's
[1:54:44] not enough to know it's the truth you
[1:54:46] have got to become one with it and don't
[1:54:51] set your sights or nobody else you set
[1:54:54] your sights on Jesus Christ that's right
[1:54:59] if you're living your life by looking at
[1:55:02] somebody else they do this so I might be
[1:55:04] able to do this you need to be turned
[1:55:06] heavenly people are not your example
[1:55:14] Jesus Christ here's our example cuz you
[1:55:20] get going one way and you think well
[1:55:22] so-and-so doing this it might be alright
[1:55:24] God might have dealt with their heart
[1:55:26] and they're no longer doing some of
[1:55:28] those things and you're continuing on as
[1:55:30] though it's been approved whoa pastored
[1:55:35] back turned heavenly turned heavenly
[1:55:41] that's what the Holy Ghost does in you
[1:55:43] he turns you heavenly oh ha Trump does
[1:55:48] this whole Trump does this whole trim
[1:55:50] the burning the Trump I'm waiting on
[1:55:54] [Applause]
[1:55:56] I'm looking for a Trump that has a pure
[1:55:59] and holy sound a trunk that has meaning
[1:56:01] and significance to my life a trumpet
[1:56:04] that brings about a real transformation
[1:56:06] and change of the very sales of my body
[1:56:08] that's the kind of change I'm looking
[1:56:10] for not change in my pocket but a
[1:56:21] heartbeat of God I'm telling your
[1:56:24] friends to get focused on these things
[1:56:25] of the earth you will be left behind
[1:56:29] just because you come here and you said
[1:56:31] in this church is not a sign it's not
[1:56:33] sealed in that you're going in the
[1:56:34] rapture you're going in the rapture is
[1:56:36] you first must be raised up I'll tell
[1:56:39] you this right here there ain't a man in
[1:56:40] here they ain't a woman in here they
[1:56:41] ain't nobody even the prophet of God
[1:56:43] standing here even Jesus Christ himself
[1:56:46] cannot put it in your heart you've got
[1:56:48] to welcome it you've got to see that
[1:56:51] it's more than life but if you're
[1:56:56] content with the church life that's all
[1:56:58] you ever be I'm saying this to you this
[1:57:02] morning because I love you you're not
[1:57:04] going in a rapture unless you've been
[1:57:05] raised up and the only way you can be
[1:57:09] raised up is you first got to realize
[1:57:11] you need to die amen
[1:57:15] and when you die you're buried then you
[1:57:17] can be raised up and when you're raised
[1:57:20] up then you're ready for the rapture
[1:57:22] you're no longer walking with the old
[1:57:24] man but you are new man and new creation
[1:57:28] in Christ Jesus
[1:57:29] all your motives objectives ambitions
[1:57:32] have been changed to love him you
[1:57:36] understand I'm not talking about a
[1:57:38] concept of him remember as Pilgrims and
[1:57:42] strangers our lives show the token the
[1:57:45] seal shows coming and going when the
[1:57:49] blood has been applied the Prophet said
[1:57:52] just to have the blood in the basin
[1:58:00] it has to be applied when it's applied
[1:58:06] it brings about change and the change
[1:58:10] that it brings about it changes this
[1:58:12] inner man it turns it heavenly it raises
[1:58:18] you up can I have just about five more
[1:58:22] minutes
[1:58:22] I want out I want to just drop something
[1:58:25] here now that's the Ernest oh my let me
[1:58:29] just read that whole statement again it
[1:58:36] was once subject to sin in mire and
[1:58:38] corruption I don't care how many times I

[2:01:24] picks on me we love you brother Doug
[2:01:29] here on the Easter seal the Prophet he
[2:01:32] makes a statement in paragraph 97 he
[2:01:40] says the earnest or the potential the
[2:01:41] quickening power of your resurrection
[2:01:43] when you receive the Holy Spirit is then
[2:01:45] dwelling in you the potential of it you
[2:01:48] are now on your way growing to the full
[2:01:52] resurrection no tree just comes up
[2:01:56] overnight it's got to grow as we grow in
[2:02:00] the Grace and knowledge of God you are
[2:02:02] baptized into the Holy Spirit
[2:02:05] now as the Pentecostal church baptized
[2:02:07] into the Holy Spirit it's begin growing
[2:02:09] limbs has died they was pruning them off
[2:02:11] but the tree is still growing it's still
[2:02:13] going on because it's got to come to the
[2:02:15] resurrection it's true in in our lives
[2:02:20] things that we once thought what as they
[2:02:24] do as God continues to reveal himself
[2:02:26] and he's quickening that word to us
[2:02:28] it's pruned away through the tests and
[2:02:31] trials it's coming what's the test in
[2:02:33] job it's just pruning it's removing
[2:02:36] what's he removing he's removing the
[2:02:37] part of us that's really not us
[2:02:43] they're led by the spirit to quicken the
[2:02:47] word to you who is believers the word
[2:02:50] keeps quickening as you come to the
[2:02:52] first limb second limb third limb on up
[2:02:54] it just keeps quickening the spirit of
[2:02:56] God keeps quickening to you the earnest
[2:03:01] in you the earnest in me raised up ready
[2:03:06] for rapture he's continuing to quicken
[2:03:08] his word to us I hope this doesn't
[2:03:14] stumble you he wouldn't matter if God if
[2:03:19] it was another hundred years
[2:03:21] this word is gonna keep quickening I
[2:03:26] don't believe gonna be another hundred
[2:03:29] years and I'm what I'm what I'm saying
[2:03:32] within it the word it keeps quickening
[2:03:34] the message the scriptures the Bible is
[2:03:38] not like an accumulation of facts I can
[2:03:40] remember this chapter I can remember
[2:03:42] this verse I can remember this quote
[2:03:43] there's a lot of quotes there's a lot of
[2:03:45] quotes I can react and remember I can I
[2:03:47] can state them how brother branham the
[2:03:49] fluctuations words but I can hear it in
[2:03:50] my mind but that doesn't mean anything
[2:03:53] it's not about memory it's not about
[2:03:55] what we can remember because listen
[2:03:57] friends it's not like accumulation of
[2:03:59] knowledge it's where God is revealing
[2:04:01] and making himself real to us and you'll
[2:04:04] find that God can come right back around
[2:04:06] and perhaps even the same scripture the
[2:04:09] same quote he can read it again in
[2:04:11] another service you know come back
[2:04:12] around and it'll speak right to your
[2:04:14] need right at that moment why it's him
[2:04:18] the author who's quickening the word to
[2:04:22] our hearts so we're raised up and ready
[2:04:26] for rapture if you're not raised up this
[2:04:28] morning you have an opportunity you do
[2:04:33] don't don't don't despise it don't
[2:04:36] despise it don't say well you know I
[2:04:37] seem like every time I'm coming there
[2:04:39] preaching on me if you're feeling that
[2:04:40] God if you're feeling that tug on your
[2:04:42] heart that's God try desiring to draw
[2:04:45] you to himself what do I do
[2:04:46] surrender to that don't be afraid of it
[2:04:49] surrender to him and let him do and
[2:04:51] welcome him in allow him to click in the
[2:04:53] word
[2:04:54] letting keep quickening word let him
[2:04:55] keep moving within your life don't say
[2:04:58] well once I get rid of this and I get
[2:04:59] rid no no let let him let him he is the
[2:05:03] fountain that's open in the house of
[2:05:05] David it's him that is the dissolver of
[2:05:08] all doubts he settles all things it's
[2:05:09] him
[2:05:10] in your life and in my life let him do
[2:05:13] the work but it's it's like this if you
[2:05:16] know if if you don't send your kid to
[2:05:19] school sorry for all the boys and girls
[2:05:22] going to school if you don't send them
[2:05:24] to school how can they learn you have to
[2:05:30] keep submitting yourself to the Lord you
[2:05:34] put on a message when you're at home
[2:05:37] you're riding in the car you're praying
[2:05:39] pray after those things seek after read
[2:05:43] in the scriptures
[2:05:43] listen enemy says they don't make any
[2:05:46] sense to you your mind your mind says
[2:05:48] he's not making any sense to you listen
[2:05:50] as you're reading those are not just
[2:05:53] man's words that's God's Word and God
[2:05:58] comes to confirm his word in your life
[2:06:03] so what am I doing is I'm feeding on
[2:06:05] ever the same it's like maybe not being
[2:06:07] understanding I'm not listen don't pay
[2:06:10] attention to that place that's an
[2:06:13] earthly voice that's a voice of trying
[2:06:16] to somehow get you to think as though
[2:06:17] that it has to be understood in an
[2:06:19] earthly way that's not how we know God
[2:06:21] God is spiritually revealed and
[2:06:24] discerned and that same God as he speaks
[2:06:27] to you as you you as you give yourself
[2:06:30] why would why are you giving yourself to
[2:06:32] him because you know he who made the
[2:06:37] promise to give the promise
[2:06:42] after he raised and he was ascending up
[2:06:45] the scriptures tell us in the Book of
[2:06:47] Luke the last verses in the Book of Luke
[2:06:49] the scripture says as he was ascending
[2:06:52] up you know when he was ascending up the
[2:06:55] disciples didn't see the Old Testament
[2:06:57] Saints going with him it was a secret
[2:06:59] going but what they did they ran into
[2:07:04] the city the Bible said were filled with
[2:07:06] joy they didn't even have the Holy Ghost
[2:07:10] yet but they had they had that it's like
[2:07:15] the quarter in the hand they knew he who
[2:07:18] gave the promise that I go before you he
[2:07:22] told us where to go and then they had a
[2:07:24] faith and confidence he fulfills his
[2:07:27] word that's why he would not just come
[2:07:30] out to him and say look I'm Jesus I'm
[2:07:31] Jesus he revealed himself to them by his
[2:07:35] showing that what I have said I will
[2:07:38] perform and the same God who speaks to
[2:07:41] your heart he's the same God would
[2:07:42] perform his word listen friends I say
[2:07:45] this for from the depths of my heart you
[2:07:47] don't want to settle for just a church
[2:07:48] life you want Christ to be your life and
[2:07:52] for those that's raised up keep growing
[2:07:57] living in its place and a state of
[2:08:00] readiness taking into account why
[2:08:03] everything you know here we are we're on
[2:08:06] the were on the launch pad
[2:08:08] countdown what do we do rest in him it
[2:08:14] won't be long oh yeah

[2:08:19] the plane the pilots here

[2:08:30] to minister to our need look as he said
[2:08:35] in his word we have the earnest you have
[2:08:40] the earnest within your life
[2:08:41] that ought to be the joy and what you're
[2:08:43] looking for day after day it moves your
[2:08:47] life and moves your heart you have the
[2:08:50] earnest so let the devil say whatever he
[2:08:54] wants to thing you have a word that is
[2:08:59] more sure you have a full assurance it's
[2:09:03] God who has spoken in you that you were
[2:09:09] always a part that is a sure word but
[2:09:17] something I don't know what tomorrow I
[2:09:18] know I don't know what tomorrow holds I
[2:09:19] don't know what next week calls I didn't
[2:09:20] know I didn't we wouldn't even plan on

[2:09:25] was happening none of you planned on the
[2:09:26] events from last Sunday into you know
[2:09:28] the first probably we didn't plan on
[2:09:29] those events but God know and what we
[2:09:34] stand on we stand in that assurance that
[2:09:37] he's placed enough raised up ready for

[2:13:35] it's that life within us
[2:13:36] it's just our desire that in everything
[2:13:38] Lord it's not as one Lord trying to do

[2:14:37] else but you're not talking to us about
[2:14:39] what we're going through the Lord is
[2:14:44] like what you spoke to his moments ago
[2:14:47] we don't want to live in that humanistic
[2:14:50] place we want Lord to cast our hopes as
[2:14:55] an anchor within the veil Lord living
