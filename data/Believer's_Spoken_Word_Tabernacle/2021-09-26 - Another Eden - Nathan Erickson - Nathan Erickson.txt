kim too don't we amen sister browning precious sister i guess they didn't want her at the men's meeting this weekend so we're glad to have her home with us amen amen praise the lord now genesis chapter 1 and we'll start at the 26th verse and we'll wrap around a little bit into the second chapter um just pray for me this morning uh that the lord will help me put it all together just right i've been on a little thought for a few services now and um and so i just want to i want to lay a little foundation here and then and then go into a thought on another eden another eden amen that's what we're looking for amen another eden genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea the fowl of the air and over the cattle over all the earth every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and defile the air over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and god said behold i've given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the earth every tree into which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be from meat and to every beast of the earth to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat as and it was so and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good amen it was very good in the garden and the evening and the morning were the sixth day thus the heavens and the earth were finished all the host of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it he had rested from his work which god had created and made and these are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth in the heavens and every plant to the field before it was in the earth every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul that's what a real man an original creation is a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen amen thank god for the reading of his word we're looking for another eden a beautiful place a hiding place a refuge a paradise let's have a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the word god and we're so lord we're so desiring as a people i believe father that these people being christians being believers father these people that are gathered here this morning are feeling as i do the pressures of satan's eden and lord we we know that we are not satisfied with what this world has to offer but down on the inside there's a longing there's a desire lord there's a yearning for something more something original something beautiful oh god lord i pray as we would fellowship around your word this morning that father you would just come on the scene lord and speak to us lord in a special in a personal way we want to be all of us lord not only the speaker but the hearer we want to be out of your way father our our our distractions our our thoughts our personal opinions and preconcept whatever would hinder father we want it to be out of the way that you could come and walk with us and talk with us as you did with your children in the garden of eden and speak a word to the father that would be an encouragement i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you as you're seated amen and and uh brother branham also was praying uh one time in a in a service in the message leadership and i like the way he brought this out just to kind of uh as a starting point for us he he said lord tender us bring us to realization of this insane age that we're living in granite god when we see young women caught up in the web of the devil young men with perverted minds children dope addicts cigarette smoking drinking immoral satan's eden satan's eaten he said god it took you 6 000 years according to the bible to build an eden and you put your son and his wife in there his bride to rule over it but satan came around and perverted it and now satan's had six thousand years to build his own intellectual eden through science and education and so-called intelligence and and he's built it into a mess of death oh god he said take us back to eden again take us back to eden again lord where there's no death where there's no sorrow amen how am i gonna help me preach this morning all right amen so we're preaching about another eden here and and i think that's uh something uh as we pray that we can relate to as christians that we find that this world that we're living in uh with all of its pleasures and all of its comforts and all of its uh you know and all of its conveniences and everything that we have in this modern day we find that yet there's something lacking there's something in the heart of the human being that's not satisfied with the state of the world human beings are not satisfied uh and the reason is we find that we are living in satan's eden we're living in satan's eden and it's such an age where it's come so far and it would seem like we have more than we ever have you know uh that we're that we're farther along than we've ever been and and uh we were just preaching a little bit to the church at home about this how that how that man has become so advanced and satan has built such a world and it's been built up to uh with such complexity and such advancements you know when and sometimes we take it for granted this just the conveniences of the age that we're living in you know when you got up this morning and hopefully you took a shower you know uh sometimes i uh the other day i was in a shower and i thought to myself that you know that 99 of the human beings that have ever lived never had a hot shower in their life amen amen and so what a comfort it is what a what a convenience and what a pleasure it is the things that we have access to that we that we partake of every day you know and we take it for granted how that you know if you want to go if you want to go visit something that's 100 miles away you can jump in your automobile and you go hurdling down the road and a ton of of heavy metals you know and and and it's all powered by exploding dinosaur juice down in the gas tank you know and and then uh if if there's some information that you want you have access to all the knowledge of the human race because we taught rocks how to think you know and and what a world that we're living in it's come so far and we find that people are are more educated than they've ever been they're wealthier than they've ever been they have more conveniences than they've ever had they have maybe they're not healthier but they have better health care than they've ever had and and so we have all these things in this modern world and it's come to such a height and yet it does not satisfy we find that people are more miserable than they've ever been there's more depressions and anxieties and there's there's there's just so much sadness in this world and so much grief so much worry about the future what would it be what man has become so great and yet he's so unhappy in the position that he's in why because amen he's missing another eden is amen we find that satan's eden you know what uh brother brown preached the message of satan's eat and he preached a god of this evil age and it just struck me when i was studying it a while ago uh the the beautiful thing about it is because we struggle as human beings we're trying to fit in down here we're trying to carve out a life in this world and we wonder sometimes as christians why it seems like we just can't can't get where we're trying to get and we're trying to climb the ladder we're in the rat race we're in the cycle of this world and and wondering why there's no satisfaction i'll tell you why there's no satisfaction because it was not built for us satan's eden was not built with you in mind it was not uh your well-being was not his concern your satisfaction was not his concern don't worry uh young people when you look at this world and you don't find you feel like like you have no place here or you may not be able to find satisfaction here you won't amen because you don't belong to this world but the world was cr the world was perverted from the state of eden and it's been built up and satan has built his own eden but it's not for you it's for him it's not for your satisfaction it's for satan's glory it's for satan's pleasure and satan's perversion that's what it's built for you know and that's such a relief i think when we begin when we begin to ponder this and meditate upon this because we become we become disturbed as as christians because you know things don't seem to work out in this world the way that we ought to or we can't get the wealth that we want or the conveniences that we want or climb the ladder like we want but it's not for you amen amen now god will bless its people god will prosper them amen but the satisfaction of a christian is not in satan's eden it's from another world from another realm another dimension amen and so we find that it's a world of death people are on the outside they're more alive it would seem than they've ever been more lively they have a better life but on the inside people are dying dying on the inside we have the phrase dead on the inside it's what a description of the world that we're living in it's prophesied that it would be so amen uh uh uh that the the the bible says the love of many would wax coal amen we live in a world where we have where all of all of our socialization happens on social media platforms and things like that and it's quite it's quite a paradox how that we have more access to other people than we've ever had more convenience and yet we're more disconnected than we've ever been relationships are being eroded because it brings all this baggage of jealousy and competition and trying to present a life that's more than it is or impress somebody else and all these things amen there's just nothing about the structure of it the the design of it of satan's eden amen that's able to that is able to satisfy able to satisfy the soul and and the way that it kills the way that spiritual death kills is by exposure by exposure and that's that's really the problem that we're facing is we're we're in a world where everyone has a voice where every idea every opinion every concept every voice has a platform it has a it has an outreach and all day long in work and in school and as we go around this world we're bombarded day after day moment after moment every time you open your phone every time you drive past a billboard or or through the checkout every see satan is preaching to you satan's voices are are spreading his gospel and his narrative and and the messages of his world and and you know uh we were sharing with our young people that that's what really kills is the exposure because it's such a it's such a wasteland that we're living in there's these cold laodicean winds are blowing and it's just killing everyone amen no one seems to be able to survive the environment amen with a sinner and christian alike nobody's happy nobody's satisfied because of these winds that are blowing you know you know a a brother that's you know an outdoorsman maybe he likes camping or hunting or something like that you know that if you get out in the wilderness and into it it becomes a survival situation where you're out there in the elements you know something there's something that can kill you faster than hunger faster than faster than than thirst faster than a predator anything the thing that that you really have to be careful of is exposure because if you find yourself out in the elements and the cold winds begin to blow and you've got no shelter then you're not going to survive neither can a young person survive layout asea you can't survive the exposure the influences the voices all these things there's only one way to survive the exposure that's to get into the strong tower amen amen that's a hidden life in jesus christ that brother branham preached about amen is to is to escape this world there's got to be a place where you can get shut in and the world is shut out and it's the only way to survive satan's eden friends is to is to get into there into that shelter brother the bible says he's a strong tower and the righteous run into christ and they're safe amen there's a safe place there's a there is a refuge and that's what we're needing friends because we're all under the pressures of satan's eden amen we're feeling that pressure i don't have to explain it to you you're all very acquainted with what we feel in this world and the pressures of this world those cold winds are blowing amen but you know there's a place of refuge there's a place where you can let off the steam brother branham said he preached a message letting off the pressure and he used that scripture as his text that they that run the name of the lord is a strong tower they that run into it are safe he said you can go into that tower then you can let off the steam amen you can let off the pressure and that's that's really what it sometimes people wonder why we gather you know and and we worship god we get we get to church we hear the word and why we're so noisy all the time and why there's a shout why there's a dance why there's just why there's a release like that why because we're under pressure amen but we have a place we have a refuge there's a place the christian can go amen where they're shut in with god and the world is shut out amen and there you can rejoice you can worship you don't have to worry about anyone thanks because nobody's in there with you amen but it's a hidden life past the outer court past the inner court even of sanctification and through that triple veil into the holy of holies that's where god's presence is and that's available to the christian amen and that's what we need a hidden life in christ in that holy of holies you know satan's eden has everything to offer you but satisfaction that's the one thing he cannot offer you is something that will truly satisfy you why because satan's eating is built on substitutes amen that's that's what it's all built on you know the devil can't create so when the devil goes to build his eden he can't bring something new he can't bring something wonderful he can only take what god made set and make it worse amen and so it's an age of substitutes brother brown told kind of a humorous story about i guess i i looked it up it's it's an old brand of of of of soda that they used to sell and he passed a billboard said if you're thirsty say parfait parfait was this the brand if you're thirsty say parfait and that was that was the advertisement brother branham had said he was coming home from fishing down at the lake said he was so thirsty and he passed that sign said if you're thirsty say parfait and he he bought into the narrative he started to say parfait parfait parfait he said i got so parched he said i kept saying parfait my mouth got so dry till i couldn't even couldn't spit hardly anymore i was so thirsty he said it did not satisfy it didn't live up to the advertisement amen and he said you know you can drink cokes you can drink anything you want to he said there's nothing that will satisfy a thirst like a good cold stream of water that'll quench that thirst he said all these other things are substitutes and why would we want to take a substitute when there's a genuine baptism of the holy ghost that satisfies every fiber and longing in the human soul amen that's the experience brother that satisfies that holy thirst that's in you and it cleanses the lips amen amen you know satan's eden has always got a substitute for you if you want joy he's got drugs he's got alcohol he's got cigarettes well we don't have a lot of those things in the church but you know what we got a lot of we got a lot of entertainment it's another drug amen amen uh we've got we've got we've got a worldly musics and worldly fashions and just the culture that we're living in you know it's such a it's such a cycle this world how that you know uh uh when you take fashion fashion for instance you know because uh fashion makes a promise it makes an advertisement it says you know if you buy this type of clothing and if you watch this movie and if you get in on this joke and this reference and listen to this song and get in on this then the promise is you'll find acceptance you know because you'll be like everybody else but everyone else doesn't stay the same then the next week you gotta get the new outfit you gotta watch the new movie you gotta whatever it is and it's a cycle and you ever notice you're not allowed to stop but we're compelled we've got to consume we've got to keep buying we've got to keep partaking and and yet we never find satisfaction it's really cruel it's actually quite cruel and so we and and it's such a world until uh people are so unsatisfied until it's anything that can dull the pain of a normal life you know that's what entertainment is to people they you know they get a little shot in the arm of a of a show or or some kind of entertainment so that they can get to sleep at night to dull the pain you know young people some of satan's traps are so devious that their trap is not to destroy you but it's to make you settle for less is to make you settle for less and that's a picture of satan's eden substitutes substitutes now bear with me now we're just laying a foundation here but we find that there is a genuine there is a genuine and i've just come to realize and maybe it's maybe it's coming in closer to my middle age or something like that but i've come to become disenfranchised with this world and and you know i've found that it has not lived up to the advertisement you know the pleasures that are supposed to be there the wealth and the and the conveniences and the satisfactions and the joys and the pleasures it's never lived up to it amen but uh but god made a promise of a hiding place of a hidden life in christ of a of a condition that a believer can get to until it's not a manner that falls and then it goes stale but you can go all the way in to where you're shutting with god and it doesn't matter what the world's doing because you're in there with god alone amen and that lives up to the promise i have found a manna that doesn't go stale it's always fresh amen a life that can take you when you're dried out and burnt out and and it can bring life out of a dry branch bring forth fruit out of a dead life oh my it lives up it lives up to the advertisement but it's the world that we're living in it's the time for it it's the season for it and we should not be deceived by it we should expect it we should recognize it and recognizing your day brother brown i thought this was marvelous he said the devil has recognized that this is the time he can wreck women he can wreck the church he can wreck the people the devil recognizes it he knows what we've come to he recognizes that we're living in satan's eden it's the god of this evil age he's in full recognition of the day that we're living in the trouble is many times we don't realize and so we're trying to carve out some satisfaction down here or chase after something that that that is always fleeting and never obtained but the devil knows the day we're living in he knows he's got free reign to wreck people wreck marriages wreck churches wreck lives wreck hearts and that's what he's doing he's he's a lion roaming to and fro seeking to kill and to steal and destroy and he's taking full advantage of his day amen he's recognized it but god has recognized that there is a people on the earth that he predestinated to life and he recognized this is the time to send his message you know what it really comes down to the tree of knowledge gives us all these wonderful things and conveniences and pleasures but it it it it can it can comfort but it cannot satisfy the only thing that was meant to satisfy the human amen is the tree of life and so there is a life there is a life that we're predestinated to so the christian is separated from the world we know that we're to live a separated life we're to be a holy people right we're to be separated we're we're we're not partakers of this world and and uh but you know that separation is not just by religious rules or or by a tradition or b by what's taught from the church that we belong to it's much deeper than that you know we uh uh you know brother man preach a message god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief but could i just turn that this morning and make you possibly make you think about it a little bit different you know he's preaching this message and you know to a young man that's raised in the message ranks we have such a perception of the message as rules and it's regulations and it's things that are required of us things that are you know things that are demanded of us to to live this christian life a life that's separated from unbelief but could i could i could i rephrase it and say god's word offers a total separation from unbelief amen there's a life there's a there's a hiding place there's a hidden life in christ that is available to the believer and it's a wonderful thing to be shut off from the world and it no longer has rule over you it no longer has influence over you it no longer has control over you but you're free and you're shut in with god amen no one else can go in there with you it's got to be by a personal experience brother bram said man hasn't changed much amen ever since he left the garden of eden he's still wandering about in the world he's seeking pleasure he's restless he's never satisfied maybe this is resonating with somebody never satisfied you're never coming to any right conclusions never finding rest he's just about in the same condition he was when he left god in the garden and he went out to shift for himself and he's been shifting ever since and he finds it's a rough way to go it's a hard life it's a hard life in the outer court you know where you're just trying to trying to make a public show like all the pharisees and the rich men and all that and just trying to you know trying to trying to be somebody in the neighborhood and be somebody in society it's a hard life but then even when you come beyond the outer court into the inner corner of sanctification you join a church you god reforms your life your desires change even in things and you you adopt the christian life and yet you find you find that there's still something lacking because you know what you found you found religion you found religion and it and it and religion cannot satisfy traditions of a church can't satisfy what mommy or daddy believe what the pastor is preaching cannot satisfy but there's another court there's another life there's another state the bible called it a new and living way where you can go even past sanctification past the priests the preachers the the potentates the presbyters and the prophets and get into an inner court where it's just you in the shekinah glory amen then you won't be shifting anymore then you won't be wandering and restless anymore oh my come in there get into there hey man there's a lot we could say on that subject but we're trying to rush through and just lay this foundation i know we're taught these things about the three courts and stuff amen but you see it's most of the issues that we're facing here as christians is because the root of it usually is because we're chasing substitutes instead of that hidden manna that's beyond the veil you go after some man out here even after really even you know manna types the holy ghost and you can go to a meeting go to church on sunday and just get just get uplifted you know and get a manna but unless you're in there with god unless you've got a hidden life with christ that man will go stale monday morning hits and everything you had on sunday falls apart amen oh but there's more there's more for the believer amen you know the brother branham brother man had a word for it he said it was there's a there's a state of christianity said where you've got just enough religion to make you miserable now can you imagine that now but but i think somebody who's been in that that that wilderness of sanctification could relate to that where you've got just enough religion just enough of the truth just enough an understanding of what's right and what's wrong but you're miserable amen and we lose many of our people from our churches because they spend years in that misery on the border on the outskirts in an outer court and they're miserable and they assume that everyone else is as miserable as them amen young people make the assumption that because they're struggling because they're unhappy because they're unsatisfied that everybody else must be feeling the same and everybody and and they they decide that it's easier to believe everyone else is hypocrites and making it up but friends could i get a witness today amen maybe an old saint or even a young person with a real experience there's a deeper walk there's a there's an inner court there's a holy of holies experience and in there it's not misery in there brother brown said are the pleasures of god the glories of god it's a reality it's available but you've got to get in there and the thing about in there it doesn't matter in there what church you belong to who your pastor is what your parents taught you how you were raised what your opinions are your background all that all that has to go away because when you go in there nobody goes with you but if you walk alone boldly enter behind the veil amen to face the shekinah face to face and have communion with him between the wings of the cherubim and there's a real experience for you my brother my sister if you're wondering if you're shiftless amen there's a reality hallelujah and that's what we want that's what we're longing for that's the only thing that will satisfy that's why christians are separated from the world not interested so much in what's happening in the world but they're interested in being in there with god i like the way brother graham said oh he said may we remember in our minds as we walk upon the street we begin to rub arms with the world we're not supposed to be like those amen we step aside we give them the place we give them the place amen lord in their it's their rightful position here on earth there's plenty of people out here they're in their rightful position they're living all the life that they've ever had let them be as happy as they can while they're here amen but i'm not from here hallelujah i don't belong here so what what brother bran said we'll take the back seat amen take the backseat let them let them have their politics let them have their economies let them have their governments let them have their cultures and their fashions and their entertainments we'll take a back seat and one of these days brother we'll exchange that back seat for a throne amen why because we're in there with god between we're in the ark hallelujah we're shut off from this world we don't belong to it we're not going to burn with it we're not going to suffer with it oh hallelujah we're sheltered from it we're not part of leodacya we're not under its rebuke we're in a bright age we're in an inner court we're in we're back there behind the veil that's where you are amen that's where you are this world's got its programs its ideas its ambitions we'll take the back seat hallelujah this world's coming to an end friends but we're from the beginning we're from the beginning you know brother brand preached the message from the beginning it was not so and he talks about this this collapse of eden you know he says that everything man touches he perverts it how you know how god made a man to be happy and man man brings in misery and things god man to be made a man to be moral he said man god made men to be brothers one to another man makes them enemies you know man god made man to be true to his wife and man man-made immorality man all these things everything that we touch as human beings everything that that this world tries to build it ultimately it fails it comes to an end it doesn't satisfy amen and and all this has a purpose it has a purpose because it's drawing a contrast now he said in doing so we find it in the church these things have taken place men have begun to tamper with the things of god he draws his conception what it means he doesn't just take it the way it's written but it's his own idea mixed into it now we've got to be careful now amen because we say yeah i know brother nathan those denominations they're teaching trinities you know and they're teaching baptism holy ghost by speaking in time they're teaching all those all these things that aren't scriptural all this is going on now we are aware of that brother nathan but i'm talking about right here and believers spoken word word tabernacle in your pew amen in your home amen when when it comes to a place of what are you going after are you trying to are you trying to take your ideas which are worldly because you are worldly you're fleshly you're fallen your flesh your mind all these things are not redeemed amen but yet we're trying to build a palace of our own opinions and our own ideas and and we're really really concerned with our background and the way we've always thought about it and our worldview and the way you know the way the way our dad talked about it or the old path whatever it is amen i would take that instead of take the word of god and that's where the problem starts friends because god has made a way god has provided a way amen behind that veil amen don't oh my that's where you get just enough religion to make you miserable because a man-made religion whether it's a denomination or it's one person with a sticky opinion amen is it is a covering it's fig leaves like they had in the garden of eden they tried to they had their own idea of how they should be covered they had fig leaves amen that was a cane idea amen didn't work amen didn't work didn't cover couldn't hide them couldn't cover their shame friends but god made a covering god by the lamb shed his blood amen that he could take the veil amen that we were once shut out of and rip it from the top to the bottom so that a christian by the by god's provided way by the word that he spoke not your thought about it or my thought but by his word we could boldly enter amen before the throne between the wings of the cherubim amen are you are we on the same page this morning amen let's move right along but see man's always tampering always tampering with the word of god and brother brown said at the nicene council that's what happened the pentecostal church he said fell at nicaea because they swapped the word of god for the wisdom and culture of man now isn't that something see it's not always the doctrine it's not always the denominational it's not always the creed you know or the system or the pope or something like that sometimes it's the culture that's the problem sometimes it's christians trying to be part of a world part of a culture part of a society or a way of thinking that we were never meant to be a part of and that becomes the problem the culture isn't that wonderful and he said that's the same thing lucifer did in the garden of eden and they died right there the pentecostal church died at nicaea but it's to be resurrected in the bride tree in the last days it's to be resurrected now brother man is preaching this uh that was christ the mystery but we we referenced there in the beginning it was not so and i want to pick up something there that i thought was marvelous how brother brahms said uh brother brahms was is preaching this he quotes jesus how how how here's men and they have tried to build their own life in the world they've they've taken the word the pharisees had taken the word that came by the prophets they took the message they took the word and then they mixed it with the economies of the world the politics of the world the culture of the world the wealth of the world and all these things and they were trying to have a hybrid religion that would be that would you know pay respect to god but be comfortable with the culture comfortable with the world that would somehow be compatible with the world brother and jesus said in it's in vain he said in vain you worship me teaching for doctrine the commandments of men he said what you're trying to build young man young woman you're trying to build a life you're trying to build a religion you're trying to have a church experience where you can be just but where you can be part of a church but also part of the world that your interest you know you can pay lip service to the word of god but your interests are in the world your love is for the world it cannot mix amen it won't work he said in vain you worship me and i think that's quite we know about satan's eden brother branham taught us how that how that many people think they're worshiping god but they're really worshiping the devil we're well taught we know about anointed ones at the end time and those things but i thought it was marvelous and in the beginning it was not so brother ram said you there's actually possible according to what jesus said for someone to worship jesus christ but in vain to worship jesus christ but in vain and i want to get real sober here amen to to maybe maybe to prick a heart amen that it is possible to live a life where you're worshiping god but it's not working for you it's not working out you're not satisfied you've got just enough religion to make you miserable there's more for you there's more for us amen there's see that that's the same spirit that's killed every church every denom every movement every message god's ever sent died out in that religious death and now brother braham said the last plague to fall on the world would be a spiritual death and it's worse now than it's ever been people are less more more irreligious more unhappy more worldly more carnal than they've ever been and this world's doing its best to drag you into that hallelujah but right at the time of spiritual death brother brown said he said that this church will be resurrected hallelujah oh he said arise shine thy light it has come he said that this brine has been resurrected out of denominational darkness amen there's a word that's been spoken over you amen to to bring you something that religion can't give you to give you something don't ever don't ever mistake this message as a new creed or a slightly better church with slightly better doctrine or a certain way of thinking or some man's opinion amen or brother branham's opinion it is a word of light that can shine down in your darkness hallelujah and raise you up out of satan's eden and put you in another realm it's another world it's another reality it's another body another dimension hallelujah it's real oh glory to god amen amen it can put you right back in an eating condition now that's an awful big statement that's an awful big statement but here's the quote amen hallelujah uh uh but oh let me let me get this first brother brother brandon preach that it was not so from the beginning you know this here's what i think is wonderful is i i i a is he preached that on the tail end of a little series he started a series on why we're not a denomination and that quite wonderfully he references it in the message here he preaches why we're not a denomination and the first thing he wants you to think about after explaining to us why we're not a denomination why we don't go after creeds why we don't just join a church why it can't just be shaking the pastor's hand why it's got to be a real individual experience of god he teaches us those things and the very first thing that comes from the from the throne after why we're not a denomination is it was not so from the beginning in the beginning it wasn't so friends and that's the key right there in the beginning it was not so it was not man and world in the beginning it was not man and the church that he belongs to it was not man and the people he socialized with it was not man and the and the and the name uh that uh calling himself a message believer calling himself an american or calling himself a christian even it's it's not it's not man and and that in the beginning it was man and god man and god god and his son god and his daughter alone in the garden in the beginning that's what it was that's why we're not in denomination amen not so that we could feel superior to some other church or some other group or somebody who puts a different name on their sign by the road amen no we are not a denomination because in the beginning there were no churches there were no gatherings of people there were no movements there was no cultures and creeds it was god and man [Music] just you and god walking and talking and nobody else can be there with you that's what it means to be in that holy of holies shutting with god amen where the man is always fresh that's what that experience is when it's not about the church anymore let the church do what it wants to if the church closes the doors if your family walks away if your best friends reject you whatever it is it's not hinged on those people has nothing to do with that it's you and god only you can answer whether you've gone in there amen only you only you could look on the inside and and be honest with yourself and say you know you know i think if if if if if everyone else walked away and it was up to me i don't know if i would stand i don't know if i've really experienced that reality i don't know if i'm in there brother nathan but if you're in there you know you know brother branham said when a man is born again with the spirit of god god's spirit dwells in him now now he said he can let that spirit grow so this is something a little bit more than a new birth but let that new birth begin to bring a change in your life let god's power to transform begin to work in your life what is it bringing us to where is the bride of jesus christ you ever wonder maybe we need to ask ourselves some time what is god doing right now with the bride with the message with the word what's happening brother graham said let that let that spirit grow it takes out roots of bitterness it presses god's way through that person he said let the holy spirit take that man and here's a powerful statement and he can become back in the same condition he was in in the garden of eden now that's not talking about a millennial reign that's not talking about the other side of a rapture it's not amen is talking about a condition that a believer can come to with christ where the holy ghost has preeminence in a human being it puts him right back in an eating condition friends i'm not doing away with a body change we know that we're not doing away with the corporal coming up but we believe that right now amen i believe that right now the holy spirit is moving in the bride of jesus christ and it's taking her to a condition until so where she's separated from satan's eaten and she's gone right back to her original condition the original seed has borne fruit in the bright tree amen and we're all we can feel the cool breeze of eden amen as we fellowship with him along the way glory be to god right back into the condition of the garden of eden now what does that look like brother man says verily i say unto you you say to this mountain be moved see your your voice the brother said recently your mountain your voice i think that's wonderful your voice over your mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart believe what you said he said then you can have what you said now what brother bran said that puts man supreme again it puts him right back in the condition how do if adam could speak to a tree or speak to the wind and say wind be still blow the other way you tree get up and move over here friends what do you think the third poll is what do you think the spoken word is that has been that has been it's not just for a prophet it's for the bride of jesus christ what does it mean it means we're back to eden again it means when you speak to your mountain when you speak to your situation when you got the holy ghost brother there's a supreme authority until your word is an adam word it's an eden word that's real that's what the holy ghost wants to bring us to right back in the condition that's why power comes by the holy ghost it's the power of adam's covenant if he could speak to the wind you can speak to your storm amen the third poll you ever think about the third poll and this power that brother branham is explaining to us why would god share that sovereign power with a mortal man must be that he wants them to have it why would god share brother brown would say such amazing things about man being omnipotent when a man has faith in his creator to omnipotence meat and that omnipotent power brings results it's a master of circumstances that fate that spoken word has a absolute power behind it her name on the check is just as good what's going on friends somebody's going back to eden amen somebody there's a people it's not for the whole world it's not for the charismatics that talk about power every day and and and and they're all in fanaticism and it's not for this world it's not for its churches it's for the bride of jesus christ to put a adam word back in her mouth amen a word of power a word of authority hallelujah oh he and he wants her to have it the oh brother bram said the bride has the word of god and she also knows what he wants done with the word amen so he didn't just give you this power he knew that you'd know how to use it he knew that you know you know how to exercise it he knew what she would be he wanted you to have it he wanted this to happen amen let's bring this out now talking about brother man speaking about the love that he had for the human race but he had to see them separated from him that fellowship that he had with his children in the garden of eden now he said he and in that heartbroken condition that he's had to be all this time because his word said the day you eat thereof that day you die when god cast adam out of the garden god it was not it was not an angry god withholded arms it was not a god said well you should have listened you deserve what you deserve the judgment that came to you it was not a god like that this god has been heartbroken ever since his children left the garden it's what he wants it's what he desires friends that's why he made a new covenant he sent jesus with a new covenant that whosoever liveth and believeth in me he'll never die amen he overruled the day you eat the thereof this day he'll die but then he made a new covenant believe in me you'll never die because that's what he wants amen that how could we as backsliders say i wonder if the lord wants me back maybe he's done with me maybe i've sinned away my day of grace don't you just don't understand the heart of god for his children ever since you left his fellowship he's been broken-hearted amen sent preacher after preacher after you song after song you're trying to go to bed at night and a scripture pops in your mind what is it's a heartbroken savior calling you and pulling you trying to bring you back to fellowship that's what he wants eden was not your idea nor was it mine it was in his mind to make a garden for his people he desires the fellowship amen so if you're running from god brother sister amen you're not bothering god asking him to come back you're only submitting to his desire for you eden is what he wants and he's building us a future home brother ram said it's a revelation it's as eternal as god's word is eternal the threefold purpose god's great mystery is this god manifested in christ christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the lost eve back to the original condition in the garden of eden see that that's not my hope that's not our dream that's not our imagination a figment that's not our idea of a you know of a of a kind loving god that makes us feel comfortable makes us feel happy that is the revelation of god's great purpose why that god would pour himself into his son and then why he would take what was in his son and pour it into the church what he's trying to do friends he's trying to get you back to eden he's trying to bring you home trying to bring us back to fellowship it's what he wants and then oh and it's so wonderful when he gets what he wants in christ the mystery he continues said he's that seed the woman's seed he's the tree of life how many know that the tree of life is christ we're taught these things but that tree of life he said he had to be chopped down and put on a tree of disgrace cursed this he that hang on a tree he became a curse and now what happens to that tree of life now see now through that he brings forth a bride tree what is that bride tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him amen as husband and wife in the garden of eden he said oh brother gets excited oh glory to god by the same word and the same god made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back again friends amen as a member of the bride of jesus christ you're not part of this world you're not a fruit off of the tree of knowledge of good and evil but what happened was the tree of life himself came in the original seed form of the lord jesus christ and he suffered and died and went into the ground amen so that it would spring forth a new tree but it wouldn't be a new tree it'd be the same life in a new tree hallelujah and the devil hated that tree he sent pestilence after pass after insect after bug after false doctrine after church split after politics after wars and and and and tribulations he sent everything he could to chew that tree back down to the root but the life in that tree can never perish because it's a greater life than the tree of knowledge it's a greater oh it's greater than good greater than evil it's the tree of life and now it's come forth and it's put forth branches it's put forth fruit in spite of everything the devils come and that tree is you friends the bride of jesus christ is more than a church more than a creed more than a culture but she is the very tree of life that stood in the garden of eden restored to life oh how happy god must be he's got his tree back amen he's back in the garden with his people he's got a bride on the face of the earth to where there's a tree now where you can get in that shade of that bride tree begin to feed on this word feed on this message whatever you need friends you can escape this cold world with all of its broken relationships and broken homes and its hatred for one another and you can get into a bride tree you can come to believer spoken word tabernacle and get under the leaves of that tree where it's cool where there's brotherly kindness brother graham said it's fellowship it's an atmosphere it's not part of this world it's another one it's another eden and it's been restored and now whatever you have need of all you got to do is reach up and pluck it off that tree it was planted for you the fruit is for you the leaves are for you the shade is for you it was for you that's why he sent a message that's why he called us out that's why that's why you would never let the devil even kill that tree because it was for you the whole time friends there's no greater privilege than to stand here at the end of time in the middle of satan's eden amen and know what we know see what we see feel what we feel amen to have the fellowship that we have with god everything this world is perishing for we're feeding on it it's just hanging down when you're discouraged there's fruit in this tree god will put a singer up you know and and that singer began to sing god gave you that gift amen we ought to rejoice with the singers in the church because that was a gift that god gave us he put that fruit in that tree that you could come in the shade escape the exposure of this world that you could you could get your joy uplifted feel the pressures of this world fade off as you sing and you worship you've got a need in your heart god sends you a preacher he's given you a pastor amen an anointed man who can break forth the word in such a way until god can get a hold of it and make it personal to your heart amen and just refresh you in that garden refresh you in the shade of that tree oh friends i know what i'm talking about this is not an imagination amen this is something real but it's something you will not find in this world you will not find these relationships you will not find such a brotherhood you'll not find such a fellowship in a communion anywhere else than in here be between the wings of the cherubim oh and god is calling to you saying get out of this lay outta sea and death get out of this wilderness get in here with me get in there between the wings of the cherubim i'll meet you in there i'll meet you in there it's what he wants eden is what he wants a man will be like a tree planted by rivers of water brings forth his fruit in his season his leaf won't wither whatever he does will prosper a a christian will find satisfaction they'll find happiness and it'll drive it'll drive everyone crazy around them because a christian looks like such an oddball in satan's eden it's such a contrast it doesn't match it doesn't make sense how you could even be happy living a christian life and what looks like all these rules and regulations that you're subject to but a christian knows a christian knows that it's more than that because a christian's in there with god hid away from the world it's a mystery to them but they want it they're desiring it brother braham said the world is dying for love and that's why we ought to have love for one for the other because well because we're right here under this bride tree why wouldn't we love why wouldn't we be have peace why wouldn't be oh my why wouldn't we be happy god's bride tree's been restored the tree of life is back friends and the holy ghost can take a son or daughter of god back to an eden condition my my my see ever since adam left eden god's every action and desire has been working to bring him back it's what he wants it's what he wants can't stress that enough every prophet every messenger the manna the miracles everything that god has wrought amen has been to bring you back to eden with him sin couldn't stop him amen your fallen condition couldn't stop him the conditions of the world couldn't stop him satan might be on the throne of this world but god is still sovereign not one of us will be plucked from his hand he'll get everyone that he lost and he'll bring us back to the garden and even in satan's eden you can live in such a condition to where the effects of the environment are not they're not affecting you it's not you're not in bondage you're not under this layout seeing curse because you're in what brother graham called a bride age you're shut in with god oh my oh my right now and now we've come i believe we're right at the culmination of this i believe we're come right to the capstone right to this adoption time to the masterpiece brother bran spoke about god's masterpiece he's a master artist he knows what he's doing he knows how to unfold the drama and he knows how to bring it right to the climax right at the end he knows just how to do it what is that climax brother brown said it's the great masterpiece of a family the second adam and the second eve now ready for the garden see ready for the garden ready for that millennium amen back on the earth that's what it means to be shut in with god in the holy of holies friends you're ready for the garden you say well brother nathan we're not living in the millennium i know that i look got up and looked in the mirror this morning i know we're not in the millennium but we're ready for it hallelujah oh that's what the bright age means to me brother sister amen i'm in laodicea but i'm not of it i'm in the world but i'm not of it i'm not under it i'm not afflicted by it i have found my refuge i found my escape oh hallelujah i'm shutting with god in a secret place i'm becoming one with my redeemer and one of these days we'll become so united until the world will plummet down to the devil's hell underneath us but we'll not plummet with it we'll be caught up to meet him in the air glory be to god the flames amen the flames can't touch you brother sister hallelujah you're sheltered you're shut off from it you don't have to be you don't have to suffer with this world you're ready for the garden hallelujah that's what it means to be shut in there you know that uh it's such a sacred place such a guarded place when god chased him out of the garden the bible says that he put cherubims around it he put those cherubims around that garden amen to guard that place to keep it safe to keep it sacred but i want you to know something brother sister those cherubims were not placed there by an angry god to keep you out but those cherubims are standing by eden to keep it safe and sanctified and maintain that paradise until you come home they're only keeping it safe for you hallelujah those cherubims that were on the ark there was a there was a pillar of fire that whirled between the wings of the cherubim in that temple in that holy of holies and there was only one man that had the privilege to enter in there but that presence that shekinah that ark amen that was not for aaron but aaron was keeping it for you and now by a new and living way the veil has been torn so that every believer can leave this world willingly and boldly enter in past the triple veil to get in there where the world doesn't exist anymore it's just you and the shekinah that's what it means doesn't it now anything can go on out here anything could be going on in the world but you're in there with him you're in goshen friends plagues are a fallen miseries are being poured out in this world but it can't touch you because you're in a secret place you've been gathered in under a token under a blood glory be to god oh are you alive in there [Music] that's the kind of presence between the wings of the cherubim that wasn't for the high priest priest was keeping it for you it was a type of christ the only one who had the right to enter that veil but when he entered it he tore it so that any christian could boldly get into there into a hidden life in jesus christ it's such a wonderful thing to people that are living in a sanctified living in a religious misery it's such a marvelous thing i remember the first time i studied a hidden life in christ it's a wonderful sermon you should listen to it wonderful message but brother brown's bringing it out and i'm not sure if it was that one or it might have been one of the similar ones like why are people so tossed about but he's just preaching about this this life in christ where the manna stays fresh in other words he said it's victory all the time it's joy all the time it's peace all the time and it's not subject he said now let the waves it doesn't mean you don't have ups and downs in your life but he said let those waves toss any way they want to there's an anchor that's holding you and it's such a wonderful thing to uh to a to a to a young christian who's in that religious misery and is it even possible is it really real a life in christ where it doesn't matter what's happening in the environment right a real hidden life in christ brother brown said oh he he he's closing there in the service oh brother branham can a man live that way absolutely that's what jesus died for [Music] amen it's not who you are it wasn't even being an israelite that saved him it was the token it was the blood wasn't the people that they belong to the church that they joined the message that they believed the prophet that they had but it was the token and that's where you are you're under that token you're you're in goshen you're aaron you're you're not like the rest of the world you're set apart you're a holy priesthood you don't dress like them you don't act like them you don't eat like them you don't you don't feed on the same things you don't talk like them you make a different noise you got a bell in a pomegranate plain holy holy holy unto the lord they call you a holy roller but you know that's just your song that's just the noise that's your noise that's your worship amen you're not like the rest of the world you're aaron you've got the privilege you've got the right when you want to you can go in there and you can get access to the presence of god like no other people on the face of the earth think of it to walk past the outer court and all the people are there even gentiles and things visiting the temple and tourists and people they're just kind of observing you know and then you you go past that and you go into the inner court and there's where the religious ones are there's other priesthood there everybody dressed in there people dress like you and they're making worship and they're sacrificing they're going through the rituals of religion but past that there's a veil and you're the only one who can go in there and when you go in there no one goes in with you in fact brother brown said the only way that they can even tell that you're alive in there is because you make a noise but you know you go in there and that triple veil falls behind you that's not there to keep you out that's there to keep the world out but you go in there and there's that ark covered in gold the wings of the cherubim lifted and in the middle of there there's a light now brother bram said out there in that sanctu sanctification court he said they got light out there they actually got a seven golden candle sticks that they got a flame there but he said it was artificial isn't that the problem we got around the message we got a lot of people they can quote the church ages they got their candlesticks just right all the diagrams are drawn they understand all the mysteries but it's all intellectual it's all head knowledge and they've never been in there that's why i say to someone you know you might not understand why i make the noise that i make or you might not it may be a mystery to people but friends you know uh it's be it's something real it's more than emotion in there it's more than religion in there it's more than fanaticism it's more than any of those things it's it's real in there so you know you might you might say well brother nathan you know you got to understand this mystery and all that look you might you might have all your candlesticks right you might be smarter than me but you're not deeper because i'm in there i'm in there brother bram said the problem with those candlesticks he said they'd get smoked up they'd burn out they'd have to be relit that's why we got a lot of people around the message they understand the doctrines they understand the teachings they belong to the church they pay their tithes and all those things but they've never been in there when you walk in there and the curtain slaps behind you the world is shut out and it's you and the pillar of fire and there's a light in there that lights up the whole room but it'll never go out because it's not artificial it's not man-made you don't have to keep it lit it's eternal eternally burning you walk in there some of you know what i'm talking about you go in there in your prayer closet in your home and you're a at the altar whatever it is but nobody goes in there with you just you and the shekinah the zoe life of god and you and it begins to just whirl hey man it might touch you it might speak a word to you it might affect you you might feel the warmth of that flame it might burn a little dross off of you amen but it's just something that happens just between you and him that's that's where man meets god not in the religious court but in there as an individual that's where the deep emotions are felt the great profound things that you feel in the presence of god that you can never describe that's where poetry rolls off your tongue that's where inspiration strikes that's where comfort is that's where your peace is that's where your joy is that's where real life is is in there with him oh god [Music] in there back to eden that's where god has fellowship with his children hallelujah i was going to go another direction i want to close on this [Music] my message to the church today is this walk with god walk with god what i am describing that's that's what adam had in the garden that's what an eating condition is where it's you and god in the garden the world shut out the cherubims keep it out and you're there with him and you're walking with him a man or woman who's in an even condition should walk like god walk with god that's what adam seed does you know how how enoch enoch showed the seed that was in him he showed he wasn't cane seed because he wasn't out building kingdoms he wasn't out doing great works and warring and conquering he wasn't doing all the things that cain did he was walking with god he took the back seat he stayed in the wilderness with the sheep he he stayed up he walked with god and he pleased god that's what all of adam seed do they're not trying to carve out a a great life down here they're not kingdom builders they're not ambitious people after the after the successes of the world which don't bring satisfaction anyway brother sister walk with god you know we we so often we walk with the church we walk we rub shoulder we walk the walk so to speak and you know i love my church but i want to walk with god i love my family but i want to walk with god that's see in the beginning that's how it was it was a man and god that's what it has to be in your life you'll never get anywhere till you start at the beginning you know that god didn't have in his mind for adam and eve to be alone forever you know there was going to be spoken word there were going to be children come forth there were going to be new generations just like in your life young man young woman god's got a spouse for you he's got children for you he's got a career for you he's got all these things for you all this will come but it starts in the garden alone [Music] alone in the garden adam where art thou i was stricken by this the other day adam where art thou you can you imagine brother brown would describe it how the god would come down that garden that pillar of fire would just step into a body start walking down the path in eden and call out adam where are you he knew where adam was creator of heavens and earth the omniscient god but there's something in the heart of god he loves to call and hear his child answer that's something the angels can't give him that's something satan couldn't give him as the song leader of heaven he couldn't he it's something something that satisfies god in a way that nothing else can the call of his children back to him but i thought how that god would come one last time as he came every evening in the cold evening a walk with his children come and call out adam where are you hear adam respond say adam i'm sorry my son i'm sorry i had to be this way this final meeting this final fellowship in the garden before you leave it must have felt so final so terrible to adam but i just could imagine god would comfort him say you know adam i'm still in control here nothing nothing's gonna miss the thing of it is my son i have i have i have some attributes in my heart that i'm wanting to express and the only way that it can come forth is for it to be this way and adam you're going to have to leave this garden you're going to have to go by the way of death but don't you worry i'll bring you back i'll bring you back someday but before that adam i've got i've got someone else i've got a call amen i got someone i'm looking at someone way down in the distance i'm calling them paul where art thou where art thou brian mariah where art thou where are you can amen is this an encouragement to anyone spiritually maybe you hear him calling you calling you to fellowship friends you can walk with god you can walk with god adam where art thou let's close on that no let's stand maybe it's a bit of a holy hush today a little different direction but uh only you and the honesty your heart could answer god's call today if you feel that move that's stirring in your heart spiritually you've heard your name calling where are you where have you been it's been a while since we fellowshipped you've been running after some substitute [Music] amen why don't you talk to god amen why don't we enter into this and take a moment just walk with him and talk with him alone it's got to be alone now you got to go past the church pass the preacher pass the the music and the singing get into that garden with god and talk with him [Music] what god can do what he's done for others do for you amen his arms are open with arms wide open [Music] oh he'll pardon you [Music] it is no secret what god can do amen can we sing that song in the garden [Music] i come to the garden [Laughter] [Music] is still on the road falling on my the sun of god discloses [Music] with me oh he tells me i am his own and the joy we share as we take [Music] [Music] of his [Laughter] [Music] happy day [Music] is [Music] he talks with me [Music] [Music] and the joy that we share as we tear
