[43:02] history on this song right here well let
[43:06] me just share it with you it really was
[43:07] inspiring to my heart just some months
[43:11] ago and there was a black black brother
[43:14] way back in this was in the leave right
[43:18] now at the beginning of the 1900s here
[43:20] and they wanted to the council wanted to
[43:24] present a Trinitarian belief and this
[43:28] black Minister locked himself away from
[43:32] this particular council that was going
[43:36] on and he locked himself in his room and
[43:39] he prayed and fasted he said I will not
[43:43] compromise on the Godhead now you look
[43:47] at the inspiration that was coming being
[43:49] poured out in this hour and the
[43:51] inspiration struck and he walked right
[43:53] to the platform out of that office on a
[43:55] Sunday morning and begin to sing that
[43:57] song as it came to him
[43:58] God it was declaring declaring it's the
[44:03] evening time
[44:05] it's evening time everything itself must
[44:10] declare Amen and in this time and then
[44:13] to think how that got profit in this
[44:16] hour reaches back and he pulls that song
[44:18] up and he says right here where we were
[44:21] at it shall be light in the evening time
[44:23] what was a promise is now a reality
[44:27] amen we're living in that hour amen when
[44:31] what was promises are now the reality

[45:14] let's just bow our hearts in his

[45:16] Heavenly Father Lord what a privilege
[45:20] and an honor it is to be able to call
[45:23] you our Father and Lord by revelation

[47:22] some of the different churches Lord

[50:52] it's not just been here but I know that
[50:54] it's been throughout and so we just we
[50:58] thank God for His mercy we want to look
[51:00] into the word of the Lord thank you
[51:02] musicians we want to look in the word of
[51:05] the Lord in Hebrews chapter 11 how many
[51:10] of you just enjoyed the services last
[51:11] week here amen
[51:14] I tell you I thought that I first I
[51:17] thought that was about the best
[51:18] communion service i've ever been in
[51:21] you say brother Samuel you you say them
[51:23] kind of things aren't well you know it
[51:25] don't get worse he gets better it gets
[51:29] better and you know what what becomes
[51:31] better about it it's because it becomes
[51:33] more personal becomes more real to us we
[51:38] see the grace of God working in our life
[51:41] amen
[51:44] just as you just pray with pray for me
[51:47] this morning as we look at this that God
[51:49] will just help me to deliver what he's
[51:51] put on my heart in Hebrews 11 only gonna
[51:53] read three verses of Scripture and then
[51:55] we will let you be seated in Hebrews 11
[51:59] verse 17 it says by faith Abraham when
[52:06] he was tried offered up Isaac and he
[52:11] that had received the promises offered
[52:13] up his only begotten son of whom it was
[52:18] said that in Isaac shall thy seed be
[52:22] called
[52:24] verse 19 accounting that God was able to
[52:29] raise him up even from the dead from
[52:34] whence also he received him in a figure
[52:39] Amen may God bless his word and bless
[52:42] you as you're being seated this morning
[52:49] I wanted to go straight into that verse
[52:51] of scripture we've as you've been here
[52:55] or you've been catching up on the
[52:56] services even from the subject that
[53:01] we've been looking at out of numbers 15
[53:04] we realize that God has ministered to us
[53:09] brought to us and called us into a land
[53:13] of promise when God gives when God sends
[53:18] a message the message itself when it's
[53:22] received it doesn't leave a person in
[53:28] the condition that they were when they
[53:30] heard it but it brings and it calls us
[53:34] out remember when God remember there's
[53:37] many compound every every scripture
[53:39] there's compound promises there where it
[53:42] would say out of Egypt I have called my
[53:45] son when God made himself known to Moses
[53:51] you recall that God said this is what I
[53:55] want you to go tell Pharaoh I want you
[53:57] to tell Pharaoh to let my son go Israel
[54:03] even mine firstborn that he may serve me
[54:08] and if you don't let him go I will kill
[54:12] your son God sent a word that would
[54:17] bring Israel out of bondage and bring
[54:21] them from bondage into a land flowing
[54:25] with milk and honey it was all God
[54:28] listen God made the promise God unfolded
[54:33] the promise to his chosen vessel his
[54:37] messenger his prophet God unfolded that
[54:40] moved Moses into that place in that time
[54:44] then as God unfolds that then God takes
[54:48] his prophet down here into Egypt the
[54:51] word is given blood is applied and here
[54:54] is a people that comes out under the
[54:57] blood and are brought into a place
[55:02] where they come into the fullness of the
[55:04] promised the wilderness and I know that
[55:08] these are things that for the most part
[55:10] of us we would understand that the
[55:12] wilderness just to come out of Egypt was
[55:14] not the goal of the promise that was
[55:18] part of it like in this hour there was a
[55:21] scriptural promise because you realized
[55:23] the Bible is not loosely just fitted
[55:30] happenings but it all speaks of one goal
[55:34] it's all unfolding of God's great
[55:37] purpose these are not stories that we
[55:40] look back on it's all the unfolding of
[55:42] God's one great purpose that God himself
[55:45] might fully live in his people
[55:51] and through the reclaiming of that where
[55:55] he fully lives in his people then to
[55:59] restore back this earth into its Eden
[56:04] Eden it condition of where from where it
[56:08] fell from because we understand that
[56:10] what we see when Jesus would say he says
[56:15] we are in this world but we are not of
[56:18] this world I'm in it but I'm not of it
[56:20] we realized that the earth in the world
[56:22] it's two different things
[56:23] the earth itself is his this of that
[56:27] planet of that of God's word that he
[56:30] spoke but the world is the system that
[56:34] entered in upon the earth it's just like
[56:38] in our lives our lives went through
[56:40] because of the fall we came in by under
[56:44] this first birth and this is why Jesus
[56:47] says you must be born again because
[56:49] there must come a change of the system
[56:52] within our lives and God did not entrust
[56:57] that to you or I to say will you change
[56:59] yourself
[57:00] we can't change ourselves we can't earn
[57:03] new leaves and we can try to do this
[57:05] better and do this better but it has to
[57:08] come a change on the inside and that
[57:11] change itself it has to come by a super
[57:15] natural birth a relationship with Jesus
[57:18] Christ that the scripture is true in the
[57:22] book of James it says draw nigh to God
[57:24] and He will draw 9 to you submit
[57:28] yourselves under the mighty hand of God
[57:30] it speaks to you and I in this hour that
[57:33] God's desire is never to override our
[57:38] will but God desires that our will would
[57:42] be surrendered to his will and then it
[57:47] becomes him operating by His Word in our
[57:52] lives to bring forth according to what
[57:55] he spoke which is according to what he
[57:58] thought it becomes a reflection of his
[58:02] own self that in it that in itself when
[58:06] we we we think of these things that how
[58:12] that God would call a life and God works
[58:15] on our life God molds our life he's
[58:18] shaping our life and let me just say it
[58:20] in this manner there there is something
[58:23] that when we as we said drawing close to
[58:26] the Lord that when God is dealing with a
[58:28] heart in any of our hearts no matter
[58:30] where you are at in your journey with
[58:33] the Lord I think it ought to be
[58:35] something that should be so of a
[58:38] declaration from our heart is Lord when
[58:41] you speak to me Lord I will obey
[58:45] like David woods would say Lord incline
[58:50] my heart Lord to fear thy name he would
[58:53] ask God incline my heart my incline
[58:56] means to give or to give towards or to
[58:59] do to move in that direction Lord you
[59:02] deal with my heart to be moved in that
[59:05] way and friends in this hour that we
[59:07] live in this is an age and I think we
[59:10] can all agree with it it is an age of
[59:12] such hardness it is an age that when we
[59:16] look at it and we see there is many
[59:18] troublesome things going on we we see
[59:21] the uncertainty even of things that
[59:23] we've come through in this past week
[59:25] where here's another war gonna break out
[59:27] or is this gonna break out
[59:29] we have the reality where the Spirit of
[59:32] God tells us when we begin to see all of
[59:34] these things which now love that is part
[59:36] of prophecy it's part of Scripture there
[59:38] is wars and rumors of wars all of those
[59:41] things are part of prophecy it's a
[59:43] maturing of time that we're living in
[59:46] but yet for the believer we can see
[59:50] those things but our focus is to be on
[59:53] the Lord and the promise to know as we
[59:56] see these things coming to pass
[59:57] lift up your head for your Redemption
[1:00:00] draweth 9 is to speak of where our focus
[1:00:05] is to be within this hour and we are
[1:00:07] bombarded and Satan's objective is to
[1:00:10] try to take our focus from what the real
[1:00:15] thing we ought to be focused on how many
[1:00:19] times that were the enemy suddenly
[1:00:22] suddenly has taken the focus and he's
[1:00:25] moved it away from the reality of Jesus
[1:00:29] Christ coming present in the heart and
[1:00:32] life as many could say you know I think
[1:00:36] we could say do you believe that God is
[1:00:39] in his and in his universe amen I
[1:00:42] believe that God is in his universe I I
[1:00:44] see God in creation do you believe that
[1:00:47] God was in Christ a man I believe that
[1:00:49] God was in Christ but we've got to come
[1:00:51] on down do you believe that that same
[1:00:53] God is in you it has to come down to
[1:00:58] that place that all of this God he wrote
[1:01:02] his first Bible in the heavens the Bible
[1:01:06] said in the Book of Psalms look we as
[1:01:08] you look not only in Psalms but in Micah
[1:01:10] and other places the stars themselves
[1:01:12] even the constellations they speak of
[1:01:17] God's great plan and it speaks even of
[1:01:21] our life where David could write in the
[1:01:23] Psalms that quino's every star by name
[1:01:27] you and I can look out at that the sky
[1:01:29] on a clear night and how beautiful it is
[1:01:32] to see the stars but I want you to look
[1:01:34] at it sometimes it seems like just a a
[1:01:36] massive amount you see this time you say
[1:01:39] well this one looks like this and it
[1:01:40] looks like this without
[1:01:42] without a telescope this one looks like
[1:01:44] this and this one looks like this but
[1:01:45] yet to think our Heavenly Father he
[1:01:48] knows every one of those stars by name
[1:01:50] he has set them there where they are by
[1:01:54] his own decree and every one of them in
[1:01:58] their own position as they're part of a
[1:02:01] of a constellation they are part of that
[1:02:05] great body it is it is a declaring of
[1:02:09] the very handiwork of Almighty God now
[1:02:13] to think that we don't want to just
[1:02:14] leave it in the stars but we bring it
[1:02:16] down to our life to realize that if God
[1:02:18] knows every one of those stars by name
[1:02:21] the scripture said that even the very
[1:02:23] hairs of our head are numbered he knows
[1:02:29] every part of our life David said in
[1:02:33] Psalms 139 he said how precious are thy
[1:02:36] thoughts toward me thou knowest my
[1:02:38] Uprising and my down sitting David said
[1:02:41] even before my members were formed
[1:02:44] before I was ever here in a body of
[1:02:47] flesh my name was written within your
[1:02:51] book and this is where David's strength
[1:02:56] is being drawn from is that God you have
[1:02:59] always known me but here is God
[1:03:05] unfolding to you and I that reality I've
[1:03:08] always known you you've always been with
[1:03:15] me you might say why would that be the
[1:03:19] significance because look at the look at
[1:03:21] the the burden of the holy spirit that
[1:03:26] would continue to make known in
[1:03:29] Abraham's life and if I could for a
[1:03:30] moment move to that of where Paul coming
[1:03:34] under the unction of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:37] Paul would write of the choosing of
[1:03:40] Almighty God he would write of that
[1:03:43] election of God he would write of how
[1:03:46] that God before Jacob or Esau was even
[1:03:50] formed he said Jacob I loved and Esau
[1:03:52] have I hated
[1:03:54] see it when the Bible says before anyone
[1:03:56] either one of them did any works why God
[1:03:59] already saw what was there within their
[1:04:03] life it's like you taking an orange seed
[1:04:05] or an apple seed and you plant them
[1:04:07] planting them does not make it an orange
[1:04:09] seed nor make it an apple seed but
[1:04:11] planting them only puts them into a
[1:04:14] place to where they can now begin to e
[1:04:17] grow and express the germ of life that
[1:04:20] was already inside of that seed and as
[1:04:23] that germ comes forth it begins to
[1:04:26] declare that it what it was all the time
[1:04:30] all the leaves all the fruit everything
[1:04:32] comes out of it as it dwells in the
[1:04:35] light and in the moisture it releases
[1:04:39] the mystery that's in that seed that
[1:04:42] seed can look so ugly there's nobody
[1:04:45] that I don't think anybody even myself
[1:04:47] being one who really enjoys gardening
[1:04:48] and things you know really you look at a
[1:04:51] seed and if you say mine
[1:04:53] this seat is beautiful or you take a
[1:04:55] beginning of a plant you're not you're
[1:04:57] not taking of how it looks now and says
[1:04:59] it's beautiful what you're looking at
[1:05:02] and you express that is what you know
[1:05:04] the potential that lace was in there
[1:05:08] well it should a think of it like this
[1:05:10] how could you and I know the potential
[1:05:13] that is given to us in this hour has
[1:05:16] sons and daughters of God if God had not
[1:05:20] demonstrated it once again in this hour
[1:05:23] we would not know the expectation that
[1:05:26] we are called to it would be left up to
[1:05:29] the focus of where just belonging to a
[1:05:33] church and so we we we we we subscribe
[1:05:35] to to this denomination or we subscribe
[1:05:38] to this so we go along according to
[1:05:40] their tenants but we realized by the
[1:05:42] grace of God we are not called to the
[1:05:45] tenants of a man that's not the focus in
[1:05:49] the hour but all along the churches have
[1:05:52] got the focus off of Jesus Christ and
[1:05:55] it's become old programs I've just got
[1:05:58] to say it too we're a church has become
[1:06:00] a business
[1:06:03] it's become a business of trying to you
[1:06:06] know patch up people's problems that's
[1:06:09] not what the Church of the Living God is
[1:06:11] about the what a poor excuse if I'm here
[1:06:17] to try to patch up problems we got
[1:06:19] trouble
[1:06:20] but there is one hallelujah that's why
[1:06:27] the claw would say looking unto Jesus
[1:06:30] the author and finisher of our faith
[1:06:34] hallelujah he would catch up in Isaiah's
[1:06:38] vision in Isaiah 53 he was wounded for
[1:06:41] our transgressions he was bruised for
[1:06:45] our iniquities the chastisement of peace
[1:06:48] are my peace was upon him
[1:06:51] hallelujah peace was taken from him that
[1:06:54] we might have his peace I'd say thanks
[1:07:00] be to God there's a call within our
[1:07:07] hearts I I trust that for every one of
[1:07:09] us that his God would speak to us this
[1:07:11] morning
[1:07:11] I trust that there is something that
[1:07:13] resonates in our hearts that says Lord
[1:07:17] there's more for me there's more for me
[1:07:24] it's what I want to speak to you and
[1:07:26] we're looking at this offerings in the
[1:07:28] land of our habitation that giving my
[1:07:32] all
[1:07:35] giving my all you know one of the things
[1:07:39] that can actually hold a person back
[1:07:43] from giving them that they're giving
[1:07:44] their all it isn't that they don't
[1:07:47] believe that the word is the truth they
[1:07:51] can even look at the message that God
[1:07:54] has sent to us in this hour and say it's
[1:07:56] absolutely the truth
[1:08:00] I know I've been there it's the truth
[1:08:03] nobody's gonna take that from me but
[1:08:06] it's got to come to where you see you're
[1:08:09] a part of it when you see that you're a
[1:08:14] part of it then that itself dissolves
[1:08:18] the lack of sincerity the prophet saw
[1:08:22] this when he he opens up to preach the
[1:08:25] message of Paul a prisoner and he deals
[1:08:27] he's just dealing with the people
[1:08:29] talking with them and saying this lack
[1:08:31] of sincerity and he goes into so where
[1:08:34] the lack of sincerity it comes down
[1:08:36] because everything itself is made to be
[1:08:40] way up here we we look at men in the
[1:08:43] scriptures and yet in the scriptures we
[1:08:45] are admonished not to put men on
[1:08:49] pedestals as far as that they're not
[1:08:52] flesh and blood
[1:08:53] we're and Mohnish Paul had to deal with
[1:08:55] that Paul had to bring the church in
[1:08:57] line when they wanted to fall down and
[1:08:59] worship Him he said no we are men just
[1:09:01] like you but worship the Lord God will
[1:09:05] take the agency of man that is
[1:09:08] surrendered to him to declare himself to
[1:09:13] every generation and you realize you can
[1:09:16] only serve God as you receive the
[1:09:19] servants whom he sins are you ask me
[1:09:23] Jesus said when they asked a question
[1:09:25] what must we do that we might work the
[1:09:28] works of God what did he say he said the
[1:09:30] works of God is to believe on Him whom
[1:09:33] he had sent that's the work of God why
[1:09:37] why would Elijah in 1st Kings chapter 17
[1:09:41] thinking of inspiration that was
[1:09:43] dropping on Thursday night why would it
[1:09:45] Elijah stand there and he would pray
[1:09:48] when he's he's looking to God and the
[1:09:51] fires gonna fall you know Elijah didn't
[1:09:53] wonder if that was going to happen
[1:09:55] Elijah was not up on Mount Carmel just
[1:09:58] doing things to be doing it
[1:10:00] he comes to the end he said let it be
[1:10:02] known I've done all this according to
[1:10:04] thy word what was that for what was that
[1:10:07] vindication what was the prayer let him
[1:10:10] know that
[1:10:11] that servant why because God has a
[1:10:14] mouthpiece amen God has a way that he
[1:10:20] leads you and I he leads us by his word
[1:10:23] by his spirit but it's not something
[1:10:25] that's loose out here and it's left up
[1:10:28] just to you and I
[1:10:29] but God sends his servants with his word
[1:10:33] and it's the Spirit of Truth let me just
[1:10:36] say like this it's not the Prophet
[1:10:38] packing the message it's a living God
[1:10:40] packing the prophet with the message and
[1:10:43] that's the same way it comes down to you
[1:10:45] and I it's not me packing the message
[1:10:48] it's the Spirit of God inside of us
[1:10:50] that's packing this message it must be
[1:10:54] the Holy Ghost when Peter never went out
[1:10:56] of the Upper Room they didn't go out of
[1:10:58] their say well here we've got our
[1:10:59] message and Alan we've got our documents
[1:11:01] now the same God that was there walking
[1:11:07] with them and revealing himself to them
[1:11:10] and had come in order to bring
[1:11:12] redemption to bring the purchase that
[1:11:15] the life might come into them they
[1:11:17] walked out of that upper room yet look
[1:11:19] like the same Peter he looked like the
[1:11:22] same Andrew but on the inside behind
[1:11:25] that veil it was Christ veiled in Peter
[1:11:30] so much so you know the Bible says in
[1:11:33] the book of Acts that when they lock
[1:11:35] them up they came over there and the
[1:11:38] Bible said they knew they were ignorant
[1:11:40] and unlearned so let me tell you they
[1:11:41] steal other parts of their humanity
[1:11:43] skill was on display they were ignorant
[1:11:45] and learned but the Bible said they took
[1:11:49] knowledge they had been with Jesus what
[1:11:56] was it was it because they were wearing
[1:11:58] the same clothes or they had you know
[1:12:00] the same everything was just right he
[1:12:03] wasn't about the outward because if you
[1:12:06] get the inward right the outward will
[1:12:08] reflect itself you see what what had
[1:12:11] happened inwardly was reflecting
[1:12:13] outwardly it was the image of Christ
[1:12:17] that had moved into their lives
[1:12:20] so what was being reflected Jesus Christ
[1:12:23] remember when he came when he came to
[1:12:25] Paul Paul he's alive persecutest thou me
[1:12:29] is that right and he said I am Jesus
[1:12:33] light
[1:12:34] pillar fire this was not corporal body
[1:12:36] but he was declaring I'm that same God
[1:12:39] blood was in Christ reconciling the
[1:12:42] world unto himself he declaring in this
[1:12:46] time and in this end this moment I am
[1:12:48] that same Jesus that's why we we had
[1:12:51] truly been redeemed it's not a second
[1:12:54] person of a Godhead or a third person
[1:12:57] there's no such things as that it's
[1:12:59] attributes and officers of the same god
[1:13:02] unfolding or becoming to humanity
[1:13:06] becoming to humanity
[1:13:08] it's draw this is why that the Holy
[1:13:12] Ghost it's not you see that the whole
[1:13:14] I'm I just gotta go with this as it's
[1:13:17] coming this is Satan's objective even
[1:13:20] with the Trinity doctrine is to break
[1:13:23] the relationship where God dwells in his
[1:13:26] people because if he can divide it up to
[1:13:30] words father to where its son to where
[1:13:32] it's Holy Ghost
[1:13:33] you got three different people when he
[1:13:36] breaks that up then if you have the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost you don't have a tie back to the
[1:13:40] father but the reality is is to know
[1:13:42] that the Holy Ghost
[1:13:44] it is the father it is the son Jesus was
[1:13:49] the body the tabernacle that the Lord
[1:13:52] pitched he had to come and redeem us how
[1:13:55] spirit listen God is a spirit and a
[1:13:59] spirit can't bleed and die but what
[1:14:03] happens here
[1:14:04] Almighty God provides for himself a body
[1:14:11] he's coming to do what Paul said he
[1:14:14] comes as the captain of our salvation to
[1:14:18] bring many sons hallelujah
[1:14:33] Oh
[1:14:38] I just trust the Lord help me to bring
[1:14:40] this as he just so dropped us in my
[1:14:43] heart let me read you this out of
[1:14:47] Victory Day
[1:14:48] before I go any further he said now
[1:14:52] friends the God that has raised us from
[1:14:56] the things of the world and the
[1:14:59] corruption of this earth can't he much
[1:15:03] more give us eternal life and put us in
[1:15:06] a land where there's no death see we
[1:15:10] look at these little trials and we think
[1:15:14] they are something well either nothing
[1:15:17] but little testing times then you
[1:15:21] realize that the prophets are not he's
[1:15:22] not being a smart aleck this is the
[1:15:24] scripture Romans 8 he says the
[1:15:28] sufferings of this present time it's not
[1:15:33] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:15:37] that shall be revealed in us there's not
[1:15:41] one of us not one of us not one not one
[1:15:44] that would drive across the bridge I
[1:15:47] don't care if it's lost in Henderson now
[1:15:50] one of us or the bridge over here I
[1:15:53] can't remember the name on it bascule
[1:15:56] bridge there's not one of us would drive
[1:15:59] across a bridge unless it's been tested
[1:16:07] it's gotta be tested because when you
[1:16:12] get on that bridge you're taking your
[1:16:14] life into your hands it can be a
[1:16:20] beautiful structure but the question is
[1:16:23] no matter how beautiful it is will it
[1:16:26] hold up that's why the Holy Spirit
[1:16:32] through the Lord has showed us over and
[1:16:35] over again we don't walk by sight you
[1:16:38] walk by faith this is like John in the
[1:16:43] Book of Revelations when he looks upon
[1:16:45] the woman she is adorned with scarlet
[1:16:48] and my decked out with crosses and my's
[1:16:51] just he heat the Bible says he was in
[1:16:54] all but when the Spirit of God let him
[1:16:57] know this bridge won't get you there it
[1:17:03] was pulled back and he was showed in her
[1:17:06] is the blood of the prophets the blood
[1:17:11] of the martyrs she proclaiming to stand
[1:17:13] for truth but yet she was an enemy of
[1:17:17] truth it wasn't just about having the
[1:17:21] gospel book laying around she's against
[1:17:25] that reality of Christ himself being
[1:17:29] brought forth in his people
[1:17:34] and that's the earnest desire of every
[1:17:38] Christian its earnest desire of every
[1:17:41] married woman she wants her children to
[1:17:45] bear the image of the one in whom she is
[1:17:48] given - and that's where the true bride
[1:17:52] of Jesus Christ we don't want to reflect
[1:17:54] where a person said oh you must be this
[1:17:57] oh you must be that we don't want to
[1:17:59] reflect earthly images we want to
[1:18:02] reflect the image of Jesus Christ where
[1:18:07] someone can look at our life and said
[1:18:09] there's a Christian not because we walk
[1:18:15] out of this church but because of the
[1:18:19] indwelling of his presence
[1:18:24] hallelujah indwelling our lives
[1:18:36] we look at these little trials and we
[1:18:39] think they are something why they're
[1:18:42] nothing but little testing times
[1:18:44] look at this God tested Abraham but when
[1:18:50] he got his v-day victory is when he went
[1:18:54] up there in obedience to the word now we
[1:18:59] read about it in Hebrews 11 let's go to
[1:19:01] Genesis 22 if we could he got his v-day
[1:19:07] when he went up there in obedience to
[1:19:10] the word God tested Abraham the Bible
[1:19:17] says right here in verse 1 then it came
[1:19:20] to pass after these things i wish we
[1:19:22] could just preach on after these things
[1:19:24] after these things that God did tempt
[1:19:27] Abraham that word tempt is the word in
[1:19:32] that that we would know in the here I
[1:19:34] don't know how to pronounce in Hebrew
[1:19:36] but it's the word I say
[1:19:38] and to assay when you would go into a
[1:19:42] place and you're looking to see is there
[1:19:46] oil here or is there precious minerals
[1:19:49] here what is here beneath the surface
[1:19:52] because you know looking at the surface
[1:19:55] you just bypass the property and say
[1:19:57] yeah yeah sell it to you for $5,000
[1:20:02] but somebody who comes in and they know
[1:20:06] what's beneath the surface there may be
[1:20:09] little little clues that would stand out
[1:20:12] up here that would actually begin to
[1:20:15] make known to them there's something
[1:20:17] great value beneath the surface it takes
[1:20:24] somebody who knows what's beneath the
[1:20:26] surface let me tell you something you
[1:20:31] could look in the mirror you could look
[1:20:33] at all your failures you can look at it
[1:20:35] all and say why in the world did he
[1:20:37] choose me he chose you because of what's
[1:20:40] beneath the surface why did he deal with
[1:20:47] my life he dealt with your life because
[1:20:49] of what he placed within you this is why
[1:20:55] the scriptures that is its grace by
[1:20:58] grace we are saved not of works lest any
[1:21:01] man should boast
[1:21:02] it's why we recognize it's God's grace
[1:21:05] that has come to us as Paul would say
[1:21:10] and we feel this way and was the
[1:21:11] cheapest of all sinners you would say
[1:21:15] brother Samuel I didn't do this and into
[1:21:17] that you may have done what would be
[1:21:19] thought of as zero acts of sin but when
[1:21:22] he comes I don't care if you never did
[1:21:25] anything that you would say was wrong
[1:21:27] but when he comes grace is given to your
[1:21:31] life and brother you realize that there
[1:21:34] is something greater that has touched
[1:21:37] your heart touched your life nothing we
[1:21:40] deserved it and may I capitalize upon
[1:21:44] that for every young person here you
[1:21:46] don't have to go in the world to know
[1:21:49] God's grace you can know what it is for
[1:21:54] a Living God to come down and change
[1:21:57] your very nature
[1:22:00] that's grace in this hour
[1:22:05] God did test
[1:22:07] Abraham when they are say I'm have you
[1:22:16] ever seen one of them big drill bits
[1:22:17] where they go down way deep in the earth
[1:22:21] you sitting on top you know you just
[1:22:23] stand on time you watch them sometimes
[1:22:25] on the oil rigs just standing there how
[1:22:28] long's it's gonna be a long time what
[1:22:32] are you doing we're taking a core sample
[1:22:36] we're going to we're going to get a
[1:22:38] sample of what's beneath the surface
[1:22:42] they pour that core sample up and there
[1:22:45] can be the different strata or the
[1:22:47] different layers that's broke down and
[1:22:49] each one of those layers tell a story
[1:22:54] let me tell you something there's a
[1:22:56] deeper story than all the scars and
[1:22:59] marks of sin you might have a lot of sin
[1:23:03] marks of fossils in your life and say I
[1:23:05] wish had have never done that wish I'd
[1:23:07] have never done that but let him go
[1:23:09] deeper
[1:23:14] there's a lot of old dinosaur bones and
[1:23:17] no doubt you're ashamed
[1:23:18] let him go deep that
[1:23:29] let me tell you something nobody else
[1:23:31] has this kind of equipment he has a
[1:23:34] patent on this one nobody can go to that
[1:23:39] depth that depth in your life and in my
[1:23:43] life to where you wonder how could it be
[1:23:46] am I one of them if this and he keeps
[1:23:48] going
[1:23:49] he keeps going he keeps calling what's
[1:23:51] he doing he is pulling out of your what
[1:23:54] he put within you but what about all the
[1:24:03] layers of my life I am pulling out what
[1:24:06] I know is there and he pulls it out and
[1:24:13] you know what he says yeah I knew I was
[1:24:14] there the whole time
[1:24:17] did you catch that he says I knew I was
[1:24:20] there the whole time
[1:24:24] God is a family we do not become sons
[1:24:31] and daughters we always were sons and
[1:24:34] daughters of God he's bringing weather
[1:24:40] later we're gonna say what I do yield
[1:24:42] drawn and to God how do I draw man to
[1:24:45] God let every thought that is contrary
[1:24:47] to it put it aside entertain his
[1:24:51] thoughts what he said to you Oh God
[1:25:00] lord help us this morning he called to
[1:25:06] Abraham and he said he said unto Him
[1:25:09] Abraham and he said Behold Here I am he
[1:25:15] said take now thy son thine only son
[1:25:20] Isaac whom thou lovest
[1:25:28] Abraham had another son called ish man
[1:25:39] it was a Sun that was brought forth
[1:25:42] based on the will of flesh trying to
[1:25:47] bring to pass the will of God Paul deals
[1:25:52] with it in the book of Galatians we see
[1:25:54] it and look look to this day Isaac
[1:25:58] Israel is troubled with Ishmael
[1:26:03] Ishmael hates Isaac let me just tell you
[1:26:11] what that is that if when we you look in
[1:26:13] the scriptures you realize it's the
[1:26:15] spirit of Satan because if he could
[1:26:18] establish the Jews then he could stifle
[1:26:22] prophecy but he can't stop the Word of
[1:26:27] God one of these days I'm going to shake
[1:26:33] the hands of those who win in the gas
[1:26:35] chambers they're there under the altar
[1:26:45] are you with me when God reveals himself
[1:26:49] to the 144,000 brother man takes her
[1:26:52] like this
[1:26:52] he said when Joseph steps forward over
[1:26:55] there to make himself known to the
[1:26:57] 144,000 that is alive he said at that
[1:27:00] time it'll also break over on those
[1:27:02] souls that are under the altar and they
[1:27:04] will all recognize who Joseph really is
[1:27:09] you see what's happening it's a
[1:27:11] converging of dimensions amen that's
[1:27:15] what's in fact is happening upon our
[1:27:17] lives now
[1:27:20] it's that spirit of that land that is
[1:27:23] overtaking on our lives right now Oh
[1:27:32] glory be to God
[1:27:40] take that only son I want you to watch
[1:27:42] this listen to me
[1:27:45] God is not bringing up Abraham's past
[1:27:51] there's a lot that like we could preach
[1:27:54] what's in here this is why Paul said I
[1:27:57] have learned to forget those things
[1:28:00] which are behind me and I reach forward
[1:28:04] you know what this you know this was
[1:28:05] speaking of it wasn't that Oh Abraham
[1:28:08] was walking around and he was so beaten
[1:28:10] down in his mind because he thought
[1:28:12] about is from hell he thought about all
[1:28:13] the misunderstandings he thought about
[1:28:15] no no this word that was spoken here was
[1:28:19] declaring what had come to fruition in
[1:28:23] Abraham's life you understand that God
[1:28:28] is speaking what Abraham is coming to
[1:28:31] and the word when it's spoken will bring
[1:28:34] forth out of Abraham what is there just
[1:28:39] the previous chapter previous verses is
[1:28:42] where Ishmael has been put out of the
[1:28:46] camp this is why look at Abraham's life
[1:28:50] look how it unfolds first thing come out
[1:28:57] from that country in that kindred
[1:29:02] obedience the same wall you obey what he
[1:29:08] is telling you to do well saying I won't
[1:29:13] alone want to be right over there you
[1:29:15] can't get there by jumping you got to
[1:29:17] take one step at a time country and
[1:29:25] kindred next thing he had to separate
[1:29:29] from God you as the prophet goes through
[1:29:36] this and you know that's hard there's a
[1:29:39] part of Abraham family this would be
[1:29:43] real see this is where it comes down to
[1:29:45] for us to realize these were not these
[1:29:48] are the prophets of old they were men
[1:29:51] the Bible said it like this he said in
[1:29:54] Hebrews 1:1 that God spake to the
[1:29:57] father's by the prophets 2nd Peter
[1:30:02] chapter 2 said that the the the the
[1:30:05] prophecy came not in old times by the
[1:30:09] will of man even though they were
[1:30:13] looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:30:15] but yet they couldn't make a prophecy
[1:30:17] come to pass because it's not their word
[1:30:21] but then he would be taken with what God
[1:30:26] had made known to him
[1:30:28] it start with one little scripture it
[1:30:33] will start with one little word you see
[1:30:36] what God's wanting when he gives us a
[1:30:38] word is that that word would become
[1:30:42] preeminent in our lives it takes over in
[1:30:47] our lives in a little by little by
[1:30:50] little country and kindred not Ishmael
[1:30:57] but there's a final fold to this final
[1:31:03] fold what God now is going to test
[1:31:08] Abraham will you obey all my word but
[1:31:16] you know this obedience you know as well
[1:31:18] as I do that of our children or anyone
[1:31:21] you certainly would not we don't have a
[1:31:25] desire that our children would obey us
[1:31:27] because they're afraid of us because
[1:31:31] like I think how the saying goes if I
[1:31:32] get it right that when the cat's away
[1:31:36] the mouse will play we don't want it to
[1:31:39] be about fear we want it to be by love
[1:31:43] that's how God disciplines us is by love
[1:31:48] real correction is with a vision in mind
[1:31:52] discipline is not than the belt or the
[1:31:55] one of the time outer WA that the
[1:31:56] discipline is where the results of that
[1:32:01] becomes effectual in the life right this
[1:32:09] is why the scripture said that the rod
[1:32:11] drives the foolishness out of the heart
[1:32:14] see God deals with the heart because we
[1:32:19] could obey out here we could obey out
[1:32:22] here well if I don't do this if I don't
[1:32:24] do that I if I don't do that brother Sam
[1:32:28] is gonna preach on me if I don't do this
[1:32:33] you know he's going to start talking
[1:32:34] about being in the house of God it just
[1:32:36] changed something friends that's not the
[1:32:40] depth of this word this is about causing
[1:32:44] you and me to really reflect wait a
[1:32:48] minute where are my priorities that's
[1:32:53] not something you evaluate before you
[1:32:55] come to the altar it ought to be every
[1:32:57] day of our lives evaluation where is my
[1:33:01] priorities
[1:33:06] this is talking about giving our all
[1:33:09] it's not about oh if I don't want to go
[1:33:13] to hell this thing you don't have to go
[1:33:16] to hell nobody has to go to hell
[1:33:20] a pair of those that end up those that
[1:33:24] even are there you know what they didn't
[1:33:26] have to go there they have to go there
[1:33:32] but they ran roadblocks
[1:33:35] they ran blockades were men there a mom
[1:33:38] and dad was praying a pastor a minister
[1:33:42] or somebody was trying to tell us hey
[1:33:44] you need help you need the Lord oh just
[1:33:47] okay I got this I could do this you know
[1:33:50] not right now they keep putting it off
[1:33:52] putting it off and they run the
[1:33:56] roadblocks thank God for roadblocks I'll
[1:34:02] be honest I don't like them in the
[1:34:03] natural when I'm driving you come up on
[1:34:06] detour this but thank God in the
[1:34:08] spiritual for roadblocks
[1:34:15] take Isaac Vann only son the one whom
[1:34:19] thou lovest Haziq was not just a baby a
[1:34:26] second about this time was about a 15
[1:34:29] year old boy he's come to a place now
[1:34:34] think about it Abraham is investing his
[1:34:38] life not just now since a it since Isaac
[1:34:41] has been here
[1:34:41] Abraham's decisions every decision he's
[1:34:46] made has been because of this this
[1:34:51] promise that's why he made the decision
[1:34:53] even when luck was hanging around what
[1:34:57] was it that brought Abraham from Egypt
[1:34:59] back into Palestine it's because the
[1:35:02] sovereignty of God was moving on his
[1:35:05] life and God seemed fit to it it might
[1:35:07] have been real comfortable down there
[1:35:09] and God said let me get that comfort out
[1:35:11] of here well it's hard down here get
[1:35:15] back to the land thank God that he pulls
[1:35:20] out all the nice fluffy straw because
[1:35:23] you know what you and I need that
[1:35:26] there's parts in our journey we've
[1:35:29] needed that are you with me
[1:35:34] God doesn't look down on it and say oh
[1:35:36] my you know haha I've had to do this and
[1:35:40] I've had to do that no sir no sir he's
[1:35:43] working it out all the time he's getting
[1:35:48] Abraham into position for Abraham to see
[1:35:52] you need to separate from lot Abraham
[1:35:56] would have to die to that thought maybe
[1:36:01] I could make a believer out alot maybe I
[1:36:02] can do this and maybe I could do that
[1:36:04] and maybe I could do this and maybe I
[1:36:05] can do that come on now Abraham out of
[1:36:07] heart are you with me it shows Clare
[1:36:11] over in Genesis 18 when the Lord had
[1:36:14] come down in a body of flesh and made
[1:36:17] himself known before that tent door
[1:36:19] after he left out of there he said shall
[1:36:22] I hide from Abraham those things which
[1:36:24] do judgment was coming upon Sodom
[1:36:29] judgment you know that promise is the
[1:36:31] scripture for this hour Luke 17 30 even
[1:36:36] that shall it be when the Son of Man is
[1:36:39] revealed the son of man would be Jesus
[1:36:43] Christ as their rights revealing in what
[1:36:47] how was he before the tenth door it was
[1:36:49] there in a prophetic message that's the
[1:36:53] promise of the scripture to do what turn
[1:36:58] the hearts turn the hearts who's going
[1:37:05] to turn the arts not man God turns the
[1:37:08] heart God feels with the heart and here
[1:37:16] is Isaac fifteen-year-old boy
[1:37:21] Abraham's life has invested here every
[1:37:24] decision he's made there's been
[1:37:27] decisions that's come up and let's just
[1:37:29] look we can look at Abraham's life but
[1:37:31] let's bring it personal
[1:37:32] there's decisions that Abraham has made
[1:37:34] that he said I've suffered for that way
[1:37:36] I made the wrong one right there I
[1:37:38] reasoned that out and I suffered for
[1:37:39] that one but he's learning he's growing
[1:37:45] by the time he gets to this spot where
[1:37:49] he's that right here Abraham there has
[1:37:52] been a growth in his life yeah he's made
[1:37:55] mistakes he's made some decisions
[1:37:59] that would display the humanity but you
[1:38:01] know what God allowed that humanity to
[1:38:04] be displayed so that you and I would
[1:38:07] have confidence not in our own flesh but
[1:38:11] have confidence in the excellency of the
[1:38:14] power of God that is within these
[1:38:17] earthen fragile frail vessels that he
[1:38:22] might receive the glory because he said
[1:38:24] I will share my glory with no man
[1:38:33] hallelujah
[1:38:34] and they try to bring this to a point
[1:38:37] here
[1:38:44] God brings this to Abraham you can read
[1:38:50] I'll just let me just go through the
[1:38:51] scripture here and preach it he lets
[1:38:56] Abraham know it's evident by the
[1:38:58] scriptures that follow after this he's
[1:39:00] let him know get up to Mount Moriah and
[1:39:07] there's a place there I want you to get
[1:39:12] it's evident when you read further
[1:39:14] scriptures Abraham knew when it was time
[1:39:19] to stop and a sinned
[1:39:29] he had a promise that would allow him to
[1:39:33] ascend
[1:39:39] he knew because you know what the word
[1:39:41] was not just word to him the word was a
[1:39:46] vision so he would know as the Bible
[1:39:52] would go on to say he came there he saw
[1:39:54] the place afar off he kept walking
[1:39:59] towards it
[1:40:03] you see obedience it had already begun
[1:40:09] it was already there in Abraham's heart
[1:40:14] but God wanted that obedience to be
[1:40:18] displayed so the Bible says Abraham got
[1:40:24] up early in the morning but Mathew the
[1:40:28] Bible said he clave the wood this wasn't
[1:40:32] something that was easy like he already
[1:40:34] had he had to take and chop the wood he
[1:40:37] was chopping the wood to take up there
[1:40:40] for the sacrifice
[1:40:45] you know what that says you might say
[1:40:48] Lord what do I have to offer he provides
[1:40:54] what you need to bring well I'm gonna go
[1:41:02] out and become this person no no no no
[1:41:05] no no it's right there it's right there
[1:41:07] it's right there it's right there
[1:41:08] it's right there I don't know if he got
[1:41:13] blisters I don't know I don't know but I
[1:41:15] know one thing he got the wood was that
[1:41:18] wood he loaded up the Beast
[1:41:28] and they took fire
[1:41:31] did you catch that in the scripture they
[1:41:33] took fire with them they were not gonna
[1:41:36] Kindle fire on the mountain they were
[1:41:38] taking fire with them let me tell you
[1:41:42] something you're not gonna get fired but
[1:41:46] there is fire in your this whole array
[1:41:51] it keeps the quickening power keeps
[1:41:55] quickening quickening quickening
[1:41:57] quickening quickening the promises to
[1:42:00] our lives as I guess the question
[1:42:07] papa daddy
[1:42:12] look what reverence I'm asking you
[1:42:14] breach of family service either what
[1:42:16] reverence he knew the order of sacrifice
[1:42:19] Oh God
[1:42:24] he knew the order of sacrifice he knew
[1:42:27] what it meant sacrificing said Papa
[1:42:30] we've got the wood we've got the flyer
[1:42:34] the where's the lamb for the burnt
[1:42:36] offering where's it at
[1:42:42] and Abraham that word Abraham even
[1:42:53] through all his failures he had become
[1:42:59] so wrapped in that word till he lost
[1:43:07] thought of his own failures his own
[1:43:11] humanity his own abilities he becomes so
[1:43:15] ever he's so wrapped in the word till he
[1:43:21] speaks as god deity is speaking in this
[1:43:30] hour well where's the sacrifice my son
[1:43:37] God will provide for himself a sacrifice
[1:43:44] well listen Abraham was a yielded a
[1:43:47] yielded vessel he cut you know an
[1:43:51] Abraham had come to this is real
[1:43:52] maturity you know real maturity is
[1:43:55] realizing I can do nothing of myself
[1:44:11] here's Abraham
[1:44:15] he's on the would build Z ultra puts the
[1:44:18] wood
[1:44:21] he binds Isaac this was all remember
[1:44:25] it's all a type of Calvary but what was
[1:44:29] Calvary a type of because remember Isaac
[1:44:32] Genesis 22
[1:44:33] he carried Abraham didn't carry the wood
[1:44:38] Isaac carried the wood Jesus carried the
[1:44:41] cross but remember remember before he
[1:44:47] ever went to the cross the victory was
[1:44:51] already won in Gethsemane the surrender
[1:44:57] of will before Abraham ever asked the
[1:45:00] camp he already had overcome wow how can
[1:45:08] you say overcome because he had overcome
[1:45:10] his own will thoughts that were
[1:45:13] badgering his man what's gonna happen if
[1:45:16] Sarah finds out about this you better
[1:45:18] not wake her up come on you know how
[1:45:20] brother branham dramatized that you
[1:45:21] better wake her up you see Sarah Muraki
[1:45:25] proven who Sarah was carted over this
[1:45:28] child of promise
[1:45:30] I've waited on this promise son for a
[1:45:34] long time we've been waiting on this
[1:45:37] promise of the coming of the Lord for a
[1:45:40] long time I'm not gonna let nothing
[1:45:44] hinder it no shucks no son of the
[1:45:51] bondwoman knows her separate me not
[1:45:58] going to let brothers you understand
[1:46:00] that there's certain things you tell you
[1:46:03] my boy so you tell your boy this just
[1:46:06] between me and you you tell your mama
[1:46:08] and they happen it again if you tell her
[1:46:15] that's on you and her then I'm I'm not
[1:46:18] getting in the way you're gonna get it
[1:46:19] you bet I ain't getting away you know
[1:46:23] I'm talking I don't see my boys know
[1:46:26] that little bit of confession honey good
[1:46:31] for the soul in there truth is brother
[1:46:36] and I know that I'm gonna get it too
[1:46:39] Sara would say wonder what are you doing
[1:46:42] but see he didn't look at this
[1:46:45] consideration the word brings
[1:46:49] consideration doesn't say bless God this
[1:46:55] is what God has told me to do and I'm
[1:46:56] gonna go do it Philippians 2 said look
[1:47:03] not every man on his own things but
[1:47:05] every man also on the things of others
[1:47:07] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:47:10] in Christ Jesus
[1:47:11] it breeds consideration he was
[1:47:17] considerate that Sara wouldn't
[1:47:19] understand this she wish you wouldn't
[1:47:21] understand this right now but this was
[1:47:23] something personal with Abraham
[1:47:26] and here they come into this place
[1:47:29] here is Isaac laid down it's an
[1:47:34] obedience he's not fighting Oh
[1:47:44] what an atmosphere what an atmosphere
[1:47:48] that token brings to the home the wonder
[1:47:56] the Prophet would say he said you apply
[1:47:58] that token and with love and
[1:48:03] consideration
[1:48:04] he said you apply that took it and said
[1:48:07] Lord I'm going to talk to that that son
[1:48:10] or that daughter or that loved one he
[1:48:13] said create an atmosphere you would have
[1:48:15] said create an atmosphere he said to
[1:48:17] where it'll be an atmosphere said
[1:48:19] they'll just fall into it let me just
[1:48:23] tell you something
[1:48:24] this ain't words of a man this ain't
[1:48:27] Theory I'm a product of this message I
[1:48:31] know it works and I know the reality of
[1:48:36] the power of what the word means come on
[1:48:39] now I'm talking to you talking to you
[1:48:41] and me both the power of what the word
[1:48:43] means in alive and in a home it creates
[1:48:46] an atmosphere Satan know he's wanting to
[1:48:51] fight that atmosphere
[1:48:58] Isak submits himself and here Abraham
[1:49:03] the Bible said he took the knife he
[1:49:07] reared back
[1:49:11] and about that time the Lord spoke out
[1:49:15] of heaven Abraham Abraham said Here I am
[1:49:19] look what he's saying Here I am I'm
[1:49:23] right what you've showed me to do I'm
[1:49:26] standing right here I'm walking in the
[1:49:27] light if you're in the light Here I am
[1:49:31] that's what God wants to hear out of our
[1:49:34] lives when he calls our name
[1:49:36] don't stay silencing Here I am you might
[1:49:41] say brother Samuel he's calling me I'm
[1:49:43] not a no I'm not in a state or situation
[1:49:45] I'm very proud of he's not looking at
[1:49:48] your state or situation respond to the
[1:49:50] word and say Here I am
[1:49:56] hey
[1:50:00] and here Abraham said Abraham stay your
[1:50:08] hand and the Bible says as Abraham
[1:50:11] stayed his hand God let him know he said
[1:50:15] because thou hath not withheld than only
[1:50:20] son the one whom thou lovest when God
[1:50:24] told him to stay his hand the Bible said
[1:50:26] Abraham looked behind him and there was
[1:50:31] a ram caught in the thicket answer me
[1:50:36] this question how did that Ram get there
[1:50:41] that Ram wasn't there before how did
[1:50:49] that Ram get there Jehovah Jireh how did
[1:50:58] God become a man God provided for
[1:51:02] himself a body and when he turned to see
[1:51:09] that Ram remember what Ram speaks of in
[1:51:12] the offerings it's one of the offerings
[1:51:13] were reading about in numbers 15 it
[1:51:15] speaks of one its substitutionary one
[1:51:19] that stands in our stead Helena there's
[1:51:25] water standing in our stead
[1:51:28] let me just tell you something it's not
[1:51:30] way out here but Peter would let it be
[1:51:34] known it's the hidden man of the heart
[1:51:40] that Ram was caught in the thicket it
[1:51:45] couldn't get out God became
[1:51:50] became fresh
[1:51:59] and the words of the Lord and they just
[1:52:02] come down here come to this point
[1:52:06] it comes to the place where God look at
[1:52:10] the words that ring out in verse 12 I
[1:52:12] want to read these words
[1:52:13] Genesis 22 12 lay not thine hand upon
[1:52:17] the lad neither do thou anything unto
[1:52:19] him for now I know that thou fearest God
[1:52:23] did not God know this before God knew it
[1:52:25] but God wanted to see it become fresh
[1:52:30] this is where Paul could write in Romans
[1:52:34] 4 and speak of Abraham was justified
[1:52:37] before God without works James picks it
[1:52:42] up and says faith alone is dead
[1:52:45] there must be works and not works that
[1:52:49] are generated by us the works are
[1:52:54] because of the eyes have been anointed
[1:52:57] in faith every one of us want to please
[1:53:03] God the Bible says without faith it's
[1:53:07] impossible to please God
[1:53:11] this is where it falls deeper that the
[1:53:14] depth falls into our lives God just did
[1:53:17] not save me for me to come to church
[1:53:24] church to keep you in fellowship as you
[1:53:27] heat to the word
[1:53:28] there'll be Milvian the word will come
[1:53:31] that brings maturing by by us dying and
[1:53:34] surrendering brings encouragement but
[1:53:36] God did not save us just for us to come
[1:53:38] to church it's deeper that he might live
[1:53:46] in side of us and remember it's not just
[1:53:53] about this life we are living for his
[1:53:58] coming
[1:54:06] Abraham took the Romney offered it up
[1:54:08] the Bible says in Genesis 15 I'm coming
[1:54:12] in the angel of the Lord called him to
[1:54:15] Abraham out of heaven the second time it
[1:54:19] said by myself have I sworn saith the
[1:54:21] Lord for because thou has done this
[1:54:24] thing and is not withheld thy son thine
[1:54:27] only son that in blessing I will bless
[1:54:30] thee and multiplying I'll multiply thy
[1:54:33] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[1:54:35] the sand which is upon the sea shore and
[1:54:37] thy seed shall possess the gate of his
[1:54:41] enemies and in that seed shall all the
[1:54:44] nations of the earth be blessed because
[1:54:46] thou hast obeyed my voice Abraham it
[1:54:53] will tell you read it in the scripture
[1:54:54] he told them who they were riding upon
[1:54:56] the asses he said you stay here
[1:54:59] I am the lad will go yonder and worship
[1:55:03] and come again God has asked him to
[1:55:08] offer up Isaac but Abraham speaks if
[1:55:11] he's offered up God will raise him up
[1:55:16] because the promises are there in him in
[1:55:22] Christ every promise is yay and a man
[1:55:27] has a right but Paul said in second
[1:55:32] Corinthians 1:30 he hath made him to be
[1:55:34] unto us sanctification redemption
[1:55:37] perfection that he might receive glory
[1:55:46] how familiar
[1:55:51] I and the lad will go yonder and worship
[1:55:53] wonder we could have stopped Abraham
[1:55:55] Abraham can you explain how this is
[1:55:59] gonna happen
[1:56:03] you know what's gonna take place on that
[1:56:05] mountain well I know one thing
[1:56:10] we're gonna go worship and we're gonna
[1:56:13] come back down together how do you know
[1:56:15] that because he raised this one from the
[1:56:21] dead my stream of life was dead
[1:56:26] come on Romans four he had father had
[1:56:29] fostered an ish male finally God had to
[1:56:31] let it dry up there wasn't no more
[1:56:34] children coming you with me
[1:56:38] stream of life had dried up they were
[1:56:43] dead
[1:56:43] in order for Isaac to come forth God had
[1:56:48] to bring a change in their bodies are
[1:56:55] you with me
[1:56:57] don't tell me here they went down in
[1:57:00] Genesis in 19 and you know here that
[1:57:02] Sarah she's you know here the king of
[1:57:04] Greer when they go down there that all
[1:57:06] of a sudden how the King Wow you know
[1:57:08] here's a 100 year old woman I don't
[1:57:12] think so not even back there in no days
[1:57:14] I don't think so
[1:57:17] now I don't mean they're no disregard
[1:57:19] look I'm I know I'm 44 and I look about
[1:57:22] like 95 my pumpkin hitting everything
[1:57:26] you know but I what I'm trying to say is
[1:57:28] is that you know their bodies Sarah said
[1:57:33] in Genesis 18 she's the one in her heart
[1:57:36] she said how can this be seeing that
[1:57:41] pleasure has ceased between me and my
[1:57:43] Lord and the Spirit of God discerned
[1:57:48] what was in her heart thank God for
[1:57:50] discernment in our heart because you
[1:57:52] know what he does he dissolves doubts
[1:57:56] the doubts that we have because you know
[1:57:59] what we can't see ourselves but the word
[1:58:02] penetrates all the darkness all the down
[1:58:06] all the gloom over underneath and the
[1:58:09] where the light penetrates and look what
[1:58:12] I did she says no no no done I didn't
[1:58:17] laugh
[1:58:20] he said she laughed within herself and
[1:58:26] how can this be
[1:58:30] the reality comes down from where our
[1:58:33] lives were and where our lives as we
[1:58:36] look how can this be
[1:58:38] look away to Jesus looking unto Jesus
[1:58:43] they offer in the finisher of our faith
[1:58:48] you see what the word did you know what
[1:58:50] the word did it got her eyes off of
[1:58:52] herself the word by their head took our
[1:58:57] eyes off our self because as you look at
[1:59:01] yourself you only see defeat I'll never
[1:59:05] be I'll never make it
[1:59:07] I'll never you're only looking at
[1:59:09] yourself but if you can just heat to the
[1:59:11] word the word will take the eyes of your
[1:59:14] heart the in Illinois the eyes of your
[1:59:21] heart
[1:59:23] that'll look beyond these highs and walk
[1:59:29] toward the voice of the word Abraham you
[1:59:40] have not withheld that only son what I
[1:59:44] have given you
[1:59:48] you have taken it and you've given it
[1:59:53] all back to me what could Abraham offer
[2:00:01] what could Abraham what could you and I
[2:00:03] offer this is why the scripture says in
[2:00:08] Romans 12:1 brethren I beseech thee by
[2:00:15] the mercies of God that you present your
[2:00:18] bodies as a living sacrifice holy
[2:00:29] acceptable which is your reasonable
[2:00:34] service meaning that's all you can do is
[2:00:38] just present yourself
[2:00:41] hey bruh hey I'm Abraham here here here
[2:00:45] are mine
[2:00:49] one of the greatest things that you find
[2:00:52] is when the words speaking to you it
[2:00:56] uncovers our life like like it did Sarah
[2:00:58] be honest with you I said be honest with
[2:01:01] him who speaking to you he's not here to
[2:01:05] shame you he's not here to intimidate
[2:01:09] you he's here to uncover and remove all
[2:01:17] doubt that's what he's here to do every
[2:01:25] doubt about your own self
[2:01:28] he's here to uncover everything so that
[2:01:32] what that knife might come even to those
[2:01:39] of us that's past that point of no
[2:01:41] return
[2:01:42] he's here making himself known in our
[2:01:47] life to call us beyond our own thinking
[2:02:01] listen to this this is all the patriarch
[2:02:04] Abraham
[2:02:05] I'm not said that a million times but
[2:02:07] this is about God's grace the last time
[2:02:11] and Abraham said look at this the RAM
[2:02:14] said and Abraham said I received him has
[2:02:17] one from the dead and I'm fully
[2:02:19] persuaded that he is able to raise him
[2:02:22] up from the dead that's the people now
[2:02:25] the seed of Abraham because he raised us
[2:02:29] from the dead we were dead in sin and
[2:02:33] trespasses and he who was able to change
[2:02:37] my mind
[2:02:38] you catch that he who was able to change
[2:02:42] my mind
[2:02:44] that's race starts first he starts to
[2:02:47] change your mind
[2:02:49] Helen he changed my thoughts change my
[2:02:55] nature changed me all over he can do as
[2:03:00] he pleases whatever he says I believe
[2:03:04] it's the truth and every seed of Abraham
[2:03:08] believes the same thing how are we
[2:03:12] walking up to Mount Moriah we're walking
[2:03:15] by the vision and the change that he has
[2:03:20] brought in our life as Abraham offered
[2:03:24] up Isaac as one who had been raised from
[2:03:26] the dead our lives are an offering
[2:03:29] because within us we were dead in sin
[2:03:32] and trespasses
[2:03:33] but you Ephesians two half he quickened
[2:03:37] we are walking with what alive that's
[2:03:41] been quickened he changed my nature so
[2:03:47] also change this mortal body
[2:03:54] redemptions unfolded on mount moriah
[2:03:56] Redemption comes to a closing on Mount
[2:04:00] Moriah Abraham not a disobedient to God
[2:04:04] taken the little boy and on this morning
[2:04:06] he told the servants you wait here
[2:04:08] with the mules and the son and I will go
[2:04:14] yonder to worship and he and I will
[2:04:16] return but how is it going to do it when
[2:04:19] he goes up to the top of the mountain to
[2:04:20] take his own son's life yet he says the
[2:04:23] child the lad and I will return he
[2:04:26] knowed listen to me he knowed that
[2:04:29] something had to happen if you need to
[2:04:34] pinch yourself right now pinch yourself
[2:04:35] right now say self wake up flesh you can
[2:04:40] stay quiet but I want the real me on the
[2:04:42] inside I need to borrow your ears right
[2:04:45] now he didn't know that he knowed that
[2:04:50] something was going to happen he didn't
[2:04:52] know just how God was going to do it
[2:04:56] that isn't his question he knows that
[2:05:00] God promised it and that's all we care
[2:05:03] to know God promised it how's it going
[2:05:06] to be and I can't tell you but God said
[2:05:09] so he will send Jesus Christ the second
[2:05:12] time he will come in a physical form he
[2:05:16] will claim his own there will be 1,000
[2:05:18] years millennial reign upon this earth
[2:05:20] with him with the redeemed
[2:05:22] that's what he promised and we are
[2:05:24] looking for that hour to approach he
[2:05:32] promised to heal the sick to raise the
[2:05:34] dead to cast out devils he promised to
[2:05:37] do it he's the same yesterday today and
[2:05:39] forever how I don't know he promised to
[2:05:43] do it we believe it that settles it
[2:05:46] when a man believes God this was a big
[2:05:48] old statement when a man believes God he
[2:05:51] believes all he says
[2:05:58] whether Samuel Abraham was a mature son
[2:06:03] of God
[2:06:04] absolutely it wasn't about that he
[2:06:07] understood it he believed what God said
[2:06:12] simply because God said it houses got me
[2:06:19] I don't know but I am the lad
[2:06:23] we're gonna go yonder and worship you
[2:06:27] stay right here we're gonna be right
[2:06:29] back
[2:06:30] how's that gonna happen I don't know how
[2:06:33] is he gonna change these bodies how are
[2:06:36] all those atoms I don't know one animal
[2:06:39] turn loose another atom I don't know but
[2:06:42] all I know is he said in a moment and a
[2:06:45] twinkling of an eye all I know is he
[2:06:49] said in John 14 if I go away I'll
[2:06:53] prepare a place for you in my father's
[2:06:57] house are many mansions dwelling places
[2:07:01] if it were not so I would have told you
[2:07:04] don't let your heart be trouble I'm
[2:07:08] going away to prepare a place for you I
[2:07:09] will come again and receive you unto
[2:07:12] myself and I believe he's coming back
[2:07:19] like he said so what we going to do
[2:07:26] give our all give our all give to God by
[2:07:35] the surrendering of our lives
[2:07:37] what he has given to us the same of the
[2:07:40] surrendering of our lives
[2:07:41] yes let this mind be in you that was
[2:07:46] also in Christ Jesus that our lives
[2:07:50] would be a surrendered offering unto Him
[2:07:57] every day not just not just once a week
[2:08:00] no no no not just twice a week not just
[2:08:02] three done daily daily and offering
[2:08:10] jesus said whosoever will not forsake
[2:08:12] father mother sister brother denying
[2:08:16] himself and taking up his cross says in
[2:08:20] the Book of Luke daily and following me
[2:08:25] is not worthy to be called my disciple
[2:08:30] I'll tell you
[2:08:32] this is the greatest privilege we have
[2:08:35] is to be able to take up not his cross
[2:08:42] he already took his cross but for us to
[2:08:44] take up our cross dying to self
[2:08:53] you know the new birth dying to self
[2:08:55] makes way for the new birth and you know
[2:08:59] if the new birth makes way for the
[2:09:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost it makes way
[2:09:03] for you to keep on dying
[2:09:09] I got real good news for you greater is
[2:09:12] He that is in you than he that's in the
[2:09:17] world
[2:09:20] hallelujah I can do all things through
[2:09:26] Christ who strengtheneth me where
[2:09:30] they're made more than a conqueror
[2:09:33] through Jesus Christ our Lord who could
[2:09:36] separate us from the love of God so high
[2:09:41] tell depp's
[2:09:42] different perceptions of things sickness
[2:09:44] health what what no I'm persuaded Paul
[2:09:48] said nothing shall be able to separate
[2:09:52] us from the love of God we have through
[2:09:57] Christ Jesus our Lord
[2:10:01] I can't think of anything else that come
[2:10:03] from my heart you should be lord I
[2:10:05] surrender all I surrender all you think
[2:10:13] of how that a life you might look in
[2:10:17] your life right now and say better
[2:10:19] Samuel my life you don't know me he
[2:10:23] knows your life you could tell me all I
[2:10:27] can't do nothing about it I can't I can
[2:10:30] only point you to the one who's already
[2:10:32] done something for you
[2:10:34] I said he's already done something for
[2:10:36] you but I can tell you this right here
[2:10:40] that just as much as what you witness
[2:10:43] here a man that could step out of the
[2:10:46] way and God would take a gift here this
[2:10:48] morning just following his he just
[2:10:53] bringing it here this morning that same
[2:10:57] God if you will just submit your whole
[2:11:00] life if you if this is your life and you
[2:11:04] will take it
[2:11:04] I'll come up in a minute with you it's
[2:11:07] easier for you to come up here than me
[2:11:08] come down
[2:11:11] but like if this represents your life or
[2:11:16] my life and you represent the Lord it's
[2:11:22] as simple has taken this and saying Lord
[2:11:26] I've put my all in your hands
[2:11:32] and that's what it means for a
[2:11:35] surrendered life not look it's kind of
[2:11:40] wrinkly it don't look real good look at
[2:11:43] it it don't even measure it real good
[2:11:45] might have a stain on it no I give it to
[2:11:54] you
[2:12:03] you can't iron out the wrinkles you
[2:12:07] can't remove the stains but there's a
[2:12:11] blood I said there's a blood that
[2:12:19] removes all guilty stains and it removes
[2:12:26] the guilty stains and removes the very
[2:12:28] desire and changes that he lies what
[2:12:33] greater honor what greater honor he gave
[2:12:36] us this life what greater honor that we
[2:12:39] could do as a city I put it in your
[2:12:43] hands I put my life into your hands
[2:13:02] would there be anybody here this morning
[2:13:05] to say that's me Lord
[2:13:13] I'd take
[2:13:16] so one wrinkled-up this tattered stained
[2:13:19] up I put it into your hands

[2:13:43] back put it give it into his hand he'll
[2:13:46] take every wrinkle
[2:13:48] he'll take every stain he'll take
[2:13:52] everything and bring it out right our
[2:14:00] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're here in
[2:14:08] your presence Lord
[2:14:10] we're aware we're not here just in one
[2:14:14] another's company but we are here in the
[2:14:20] presence of the Living God Lord as you
[2:14:27] spoke to our hearts spoke to the depths
[2:14:33] of our lives

[2:14:47] at full surrender and obedience
[2:14:55] Lord Jesus
[2:14:58] you know every life behind every hand
[2:15:03] and Lord has the simple example that you
[2:15:07] would have me to illustrate here is the
[2:15:11] simpleness of surrendering our we love
[2:15:13] taking a handkerchief which would be
[2:15:16] representative of our life saying I put
[2:15:21] it in your hands
[2:15:23] I put it in your hands
[2:15:32] if you've never repented right there in
[2:15:34] your heart right there just let that let
[2:15:36] that be the altar right there in your
[2:15:37] heart say Lord forgive me of my sins

[2:15:57] place you see I'm giving my own Lord
[2:16:03] take every desire out of my heart that's
[2:16:06] not like
[2:16:10] let the Holy Ghost have the right away
[2:16:14] Lord in my heart

[2:16:41] brings us Lord with us there's more
[2:16:44] there's more to be given
