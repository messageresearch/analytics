[42:43] we just continue
[42:48] thou has brought a vine
[42:51] out of egypt thou has cast out
[42:54] the heathen and planted
[42:58] thou preparest room before it and it
[43:01] is caused it to take deep root and it
[43:04] filled the land
[43:06] the hills were covered with the shadow
[43:08] of it and the bowls thereof were like
[43:11] the goodly cedars
[43:13] she sent out her bows under the sea and
[43:16] her branches
[43:17] onto the river why hast thou
[43:21] then broken down her hedges so that all
[43:24] they which
[43:24] pass by the way do pluck her
[43:27] the boar out of the wood doth waste it
[43:31] and the wild beast of the field doth
[43:34] devour it now what you begin to
[43:37] move into here is how david
[43:41] moving under inspiration of even if even
[43:44] prophecy
[43:45] of how that in the times where israel
[43:49] would go astray even to the time where
[43:51] israel would go
[43:53] into captivity in babylon and the land
[43:56] itself
[43:57] would be laid to waste and it would also
[44:01] speak of the time
[44:02] of the rejection to where israel
[44:06] would reject the messiah as they have
[44:09] done
[44:09] they were blinded for our sake
[44:13] and there was a dispersion not in that
[44:15] time
[44:16] it wasn't just to babylon but god
[44:19] dispersed them throughout the nations
[44:22] of the world and israel still even as
[44:25] you think of in isaiah and jeremiah
[44:27] israel is still
[44:29] grieving that they're still under
[44:31] there's still a reproach
[44:33] that is laid there until they receive
[44:36] their day of visitation
[44:39] just as god has taken away our reproach
[44:43] it's the same way with his visitation to
[44:46] israel the 144 thousand
[44:48] after the bride is taken in rapture
[44:51] he removes their reproach
[44:56] so it's him who removes the reproach now
[44:59] let's go down to verse 14 here
[45:02] return we beseech thee oh god of host
[45:06] look down from heaven and behold and
[45:10] visit this vine so
[45:12] we don't need an earthly visitation or
[45:15] a visitation that's of earthly origin
[45:18] we need a visitation that comes from
[45:22] the original we need a heavenly
[45:24] visitation
[45:25] and the vineyard which thy right hand
[45:28] hath planted and the branch that
[45:32] thou made is strong for thyself
[45:35] it is burned with fire it is cut down
[45:38] they perish at the rebuke of thy
[45:40] countenance
[45:41] let thy hand be upon the man of thy
[45:44] right hand
[45:45] upon the son of man whom thou made it
[45:48] strong for thyself
[45:49] he is the branch is that right
[45:53] so so will not we come back
[45:57] from thee quicken us and we will
[46:00] call upon thy name turn us again
[46:04] o lord god of host calls thy face to
[46:07] shine
[46:08] and we shall be saved
[46:11] brother brandon would pick this up in
[46:13] the message planting the vine and that's
[46:15] sort of many
[46:16] of some of the the points that i'm going
[46:17] to draw from here this morning
[46:19] and he's dealing with faith and unbelief
[46:21] in this quote and he says
[46:23] the scripture said he is the same
[46:25] yesterday today and forever
[46:27] it just won't mix with unbelief faith
[46:31] won't we have faith in god
[46:34] it's eternal unbelief has always been
[46:37] since the garden of eden so unbelief
[46:42] it was around but it hadn't gained
[46:45] instruments
[46:46] until one of god's subjects became a
[46:49] channel for unbelief to come through
[46:52] is that right unbelief brought brought
[46:55] doubt but
[46:56] prior to that they were channels
[46:59] of faith that was reserved unto god
[47:04] amen god has always wanted his people
[47:08] to believe this he's he has wanted them
[47:12] to have
[47:13] confidence confidence is is faith and
[47:16] and love is what produces faith and
[47:19] forgiveness is what
[47:20] brings faith when you it really strikes
[47:22] the heart that
[47:23] i'm forgiven i'm set free and you
[47:26] recognize that
[47:28] i'm no longer what i was i'm not that
[47:30] same person
[47:31] it gives confidence so that he
[47:34] can use you it says he wanted them to
[47:38] have confidence and to show himself
[47:40] among his people god is
[47:43] a spirit in saint john's 15 he goes in
[47:47] and he
[47:47] quotes the verse i am the vine year the
[47:49] branches
[47:50] the branch and the vine is connected
[47:52] together and god has always
[47:54] tried to get a people that he could so
[47:58] dwell in that he could show his glory
[48:01] among his people i want to come back to
[48:04] this point and what i want to speak
[48:06] continue on this morning is fulfilling
[48:09] god's desire
[48:10] and i want to come back into this place
[48:13] that as
[48:13] we many times or we can look at things
[48:16] and say
[48:17] i'm expecting god to do this but we must
[48:21] understand that in order for god
[48:23] he will always fulfill his word the same
[48:26] way
[48:26] that he's always done it and that's when
[48:29] the heart
[48:30] itself is in condition to receive
[48:34] him is that right
[48:37] so god he works in a manner and there's
[48:40] there is a uh a moving within our heart
[48:45] to understand
[48:46] god has an expectation too god
[48:49] is expecting us to bring forth
[48:53] and so when we look at that that the
[48:55] word itself would be
[48:57] reproduced in our life the living word
[48:59] of god
[49:00] god god doesn't want that
[49:03] is just a caring of a bible caring of a
[49:06] book or just a holding of a tape or
[49:09] of a picture that's not what god's
[49:11] desire is
[49:12] god's desire is that the word itself
[49:16] that god himself might dwell in the very
[49:19] hearts of his people and the word would
[49:22] be
[49:23] recognized in our life
[49:27] and so when jesus would say this and i'm
[49:29] just going to
[49:30] just just read a few scriptures of of
[49:32] the expectation
[49:34] in john finches he that abideth in me
[49:37] and i
[49:37] in him the same bringeth forth much
[49:40] fruit for without me you can do
[49:44] nothing there's no fruit
[49:48] can be produced by without him
[49:52] he's the strength of the church of the
[49:54] living god
[49:55] we live by his life paul would say for
[49:58] christ who
[49:59] is our life
[50:03] and he says if a man abide not in me
[50:07] he is cast forth as a branch and is
[50:10] withered
[50:11] and men gather them and cast them into
[50:13] the fire
[50:14] and they are burned so this verse shows
[50:18] there is a need for a continued
[50:22] walk in him
[50:25] you see remember when when they would
[50:27] stand there and uh
[50:29] here john would stand there and they
[50:31] would come forth and john would say
[50:33] uh think not to say within yourself we
[50:36] have abraham as our father
[50:38] he's addressing the spirit of pride
[50:42] he says but bring forth fruits
[50:45] meat unto repentance so even there is
[50:48] repentance will actually show forth
[50:51] fruit in a life because
[50:52] repentance is where a life is heading
[50:55] this way
[50:55] and real repentance is a change of mind
[50:58] you're turning
[50:59] this way now you're no longer going that
[51:02] way so if a person is going this way
[51:04] and they say they've repented they've
[51:06] really not truly repented
[51:08] and there's not been fruit of repentance
[51:11] that's showing in their life so there is
[51:14] fruit that's ongoing within a life
[51:16] remember the scripture we just read
[51:18] god's not just
[51:19] interested in fruit the objective is
[51:22] much fruit
[51:24] are you with me it's not just fruits of
[51:27] of repentance or
[51:28] fruits of sanctification those are all
[51:31] wonderful fruits
[51:32] but it's coming into a place of much
[51:35] fruit which is his own life
[51:39] now moving to bring forth himself
[51:42] through the life of the individual so he
[51:45] says if
[51:46] ye abide in me oh i love the scripture
[51:48] if you abide in me and
[51:50] my words abide in you now these words
[51:53] this word here is not logos it's not
[51:56] just
[51:56] not just written words of god but it is
[52:00] rhema that word that is spoke by a
[52:03] living voice
[52:04] just as god in the beginning said let
[52:07] there be
[52:08] it was a living voice of god that was
[52:11] calling
[52:12] for the hour of expression of the word
[52:16] that was already sown and planted there
[52:20] so it took the voice of god that would
[52:23] be expressed in that hour
[52:25] the character of god that's what it is
[52:28] the characteristic of god
[52:30] that actually begins to awaken the
[52:33] characteristic of the seed that he's
[52:35] already sown because
[52:37] it is the voice of god that calls
[52:40] the seeds of god forth from potential
[52:44] to reality
[52:48] so if you abide in me and my words
[52:51] abide in you they they have a place in
[52:54] your life
[52:54] they're there they're they're taken into
[52:56] your life and you see
[52:58] god's word always ministers to the need
[53:00] of this
[53:01] hour god doesn't god does not
[53:04] busy himself with a bunch of fluff
[53:08] that ain't god fluffing god just tell
[53:11] you straight out
[53:11] it ain't god god is purposeful in
[53:15] every thing he does
[53:19] you shall ask me here's the thing you
[53:21] shall ask me
[53:22] what you will and it shall be done to
[53:24] you just like the examples of the
[53:27] testimonies that
[53:28] was given here god expressed
[53:31] a word and that word taken in though
[53:34] though they knew the promises of healing
[53:36] they could quote the promises of healing
[53:39] but a living god came down and expressed
[53:42] the characteristic
[53:44] of that word there was a deep calling
[53:47] to the teeth a desire for healing and
[53:50] god came on the scene and god spoke to
[53:54] that heart
[53:55] and now that life speaks
[53:58] and that word that's abiding in there it
[54:01] speaks out and says shoulder pain you're
[54:04] fired
[54:06] amen blisters you're fired is that right
[54:11] amen uh uh there are growths on the on
[54:14] the gall bladder
[54:15] you're fired and and the potential of
[54:17] this type of surgery
[54:19] see it's abiding in him god knows what
[54:22] you and i have need of
[54:24] sure there's opposition that comes our
[54:26] way sure there's hindrances
[54:28] but let me say this to you the word
[54:31] has everything that we have need of
[54:36] to address and meet the challenge of the
[54:39] hour what must i do if you abide in me
[54:43] and let his words don't just let them
[54:45] pass over
[54:46] but take them into your life
[54:49] amen gather them into your life then you
[54:52] shall
[54:53] ask what you will because the word is
[54:56] speaking
[54:57] to the desire of your heart and when you
[55:00] take that word in
[55:02] you are expressing god has seen your
[55:04] desire and
[55:06] god is expressing his desire for you to
[55:09] be free
[55:09] for you to be well for you to be filled
[55:12] god is expressing his word
[55:14] now it is not your voice but it is god's
[55:17] voice
[55:18] that is sealed within your voice
[55:24] and it shall be done unto you so
[55:27] it's it's abiding here in his word
[55:32] herein verse 8 is my father glorified
[55:36] that ye bear much fruit
[55:40] so shall you be my disciples how many
[55:43] want to bear much fruit
[55:46] this is not the 30-fold hour it's not
[55:49] the 60-fold hour
[55:50] this is the 100-fold hour we're not
[55:53] living back in the days of justification
[55:56] we're not living back in the days of
[55:57] sanctification we're not living back in
[55:59] the days of the restoration of the gifts
[56:01] we're not living in a 30
[56:02] 40 60 50 80 we're not even living in a
[56:05] hundred and ninety-fold hour
[56:06] we're living in a hundred-fold hour
[56:09] where the son of man
[56:10] has returned to the church of the living
[56:13] god
[56:14] where there's a bride that's standing on
[56:16] her feet
[56:17] amen she's been assembled by god for
[56:20] this hour
[56:22] hallelujah so shall you be my disciples
[56:26] verse 16 ye have not chosen me
[56:30] but i chose you and ordained you
[56:33] that you should go and bring forth
[56:37] fruit he's letting us know our purpose
[56:41] and that your fruit should remain
[56:45] oh my that whatsoever you shall ask of
[56:48] the father in my name
[56:49] he may give it you
[56:53] in romans 7 verse 4 this is breaking in
[56:56] now
[56:56] on a union because with our first birth
[56:59] we were united with the first
[57:01] nature is that right nobody had to teach
[57:04] us how to lie
[57:06] nobody had to teach us all that it was
[57:07] already there in the nature
[57:11] is that right now but now god has made
[57:15] a way through the body
[57:18] of his death
[57:21] verse four wherefore my brethren ye also
[57:24] are become
[57:25] dead to the law by the body of christ
[57:29] that you should be married to another
[57:33] even to him who is raised from the dead
[57:36] that we should bring forth
[57:38] fruit unto god so you see god can't be
[57:42] married to that to that seed as long as
[57:45] the first husband's living
[57:47] is that right the first husband has to
[57:49] die
[57:51] is that right the first husband i'm not
[57:53] going into the whole scripture
[57:55] but our first nature has to die
[57:58] is that right and the spirit of god
[58:00] comes down to
[58:01] raise up that seed which is that
[58:05] new nature and he unites himself
[58:08] with that so it's no longer you but it
[58:11] is
[58:12] the real you on the inside that was dead
[58:15] now you've been raised to life is that
[58:18] right
[58:19] glory be to god that we should bring
[58:22] forth
[58:22] fruit unto god for when we were in the
[58:25] flesh
[58:26] the motions of sin which were by the law
[58:29] did work in our members to bring forth
[58:32] fruit
[58:33] unto death that's the truth isn't it
[58:36] it worked it worked in remember i mean
[58:39] we had to yield to it if you you the
[58:40] drinking or yield to running around or
[58:42] what
[58:42] you had to yield to it but it was the
[58:44] nature that was within you as brother
[58:45] brown would say it like this an
[58:47] invisible union it was
[58:48] natural for you to want to cut your hair
[58:50] it was natural for you because why
[58:52] that was that first nature but when god
[58:55] comes down on the inside
[58:58] and god there's a death where that life
[59:00] says
[59:01] i'm finished i'm finished with this old
[59:05] life it's god inspiring you let me say
[59:08] this to you
[59:09] that's god inspiring you to say that i'm
[59:11] finished with this whole life
[59:13] i'm done with this whole life it's god
[59:16] inspiring you
[59:18] to say you're fired
[59:20] [Applause]
[59:22] it was god that had to get jacob when
[59:25] they're wrestling and wrestling and
[59:26] wrestling
[59:27] and he comes to a place and he says who
[59:29] are you the angel of the lord asked
[59:31] jacob
[59:32] who are you he needed jacob to identify
[59:35] himself as jacob that's real repentance
[59:39] i'm a no good rotten rascal lord
[59:42] i'm a filthy wretch and i'm in need of
[59:46] the blessing of almighty god
[59:48] upon my life and when god heard jacob
[59:51] say
[59:52] my name is jacob god said this is what
[59:55] i've been waiting on
[59:56] all this time
[1:00:02] but now you are delivered from the law
[1:00:06] that being dead wherein we were held see
[1:00:08] we were dead the seed
[1:00:10] was dead within us
[1:00:13] that we should serve in newness of
[1:00:16] spirit and
[1:00:17] not in the oldness of the letter you see
[1:00:20] david
[1:00:22] in this uh chapter we're reading here
[1:00:25] david had cried out oh lord god come
[1:00:28] back to us again
[1:00:30] we have sinned and have turned away from
[1:00:32] you you who dwells between the altar and
[1:00:35] the cherubim
[1:00:36] shine forth again for he knew that one
[1:00:39] time
[1:00:41] he was god among them and david knew
[1:00:44] that he was still god
[1:00:49] just like i had an individual walk
[1:00:50] across and stopped me yesterday and
[1:00:52] came into my driveway stopped me said
[1:00:54] hey he said i gotta ask a question he
[1:00:56] said
[1:00:57] i seen two weeks ago he said all these
[1:00:58] young people come into your house he
[1:01:00] said i see these things he said
[1:01:01] what is it that's taken place
[1:01:05] [Applause]
[1:01:08] what'd you do i preached jesus christ
[1:01:10] right there in the fulfillment of his
[1:01:13] word
[1:01:13] stood right at the end of the driveway
[1:01:15] in my socks and preached
[1:01:19] amen you know and we began to begin to
[1:01:21] declare
[1:01:22] you say what to begin to declare begin
[1:01:24] to declare that doctrine
[1:01:25] and theology is not enough
[1:01:29] basketball's fine having cookouts and
[1:01:31] all those things are fine
[1:01:32] i enjoy all those things and there's
[1:01:34] things that we can use like that
[1:01:36] but the ultimate what i spoke right
[1:01:38] there is they
[1:01:39] need to meet god in the baptism of the
[1:01:43] holy ghost
[1:01:44] i said there ain't enough souls that's
[1:01:47] big enough to handle
[1:01:48] the goliath that faces the young people
[1:01:51] in this hour
[1:01:52] now the theology and doctrine will never
[1:01:54] ever do it
[1:01:55] you can't keep them by church programs
[1:01:57] or nothing else
[1:01:59] but there's got to be a channel that can
[1:02:01] let
[1:02:02] god come back into the camp and manifest
[1:02:05] himself
[1:02:06] as the living god that god still
[1:02:09] delivers
[1:02:10] that though the temptations and the
[1:02:12] pressures themselves
[1:02:13] are great within this hour but there's a
[1:02:16] god
[1:02:16] who's on the scene that can handle every
[1:02:20] goliath he triumphed over
[1:02:23] every principality and over every power
[1:02:26] and god doesn't need a man of stature he
[1:02:29] just needs a ready
[1:02:30] yielded life that will allow god to be
[1:02:34] the same
[1:02:36] i won't preach the whole message but you
[1:02:38] you you see this was a time
[1:02:40] god among them amen god among them
[1:02:44] when it got done he said i ain't never
[1:02:46] heard it like that
[1:02:49] begin to go through the fulfillment of
[1:02:51] scriptures within this day
[1:02:53] you see david david knew that he was
[1:02:56] still god
[1:02:57] the people had separated themselves from
[1:02:59] him god didn't shine forth anymore
[1:03:02] it wasn't because he could not shine
[1:03:06] forth
[1:03:07] it was because the people shut off his
[1:03:10] mercies to them
[1:03:11] by their sin now remember where we
[1:03:14] pulled out
[1:03:15] last week and i'm going to lay on this
[1:03:18] because we laid this in already
[1:03:20] where israel was out in a place where
[1:03:23] god called them an empty vine in hosea
[1:03:25] 15.
[1:03:26] the only fruit they were bearing they
[1:03:27] had fruit but the fruit was all about
[1:03:29] them
[1:03:31] it was about themselves that was the
[1:03:33] only fruit they had you see
[1:03:34] this is why the spirit of god has it
[1:03:37] would give you an eye
[1:03:38] this example even in the message where
[1:03:40] brother branham would speak to an
[1:03:41] individual that
[1:03:42] my they took brother bram and we own
[1:03:44] this much land over here and
[1:03:46] we own this much here and our fathers
[1:03:48] this here and our fathers this here
[1:03:50] and brother branham being very very
[1:03:52] simple and sensitive to the holy spirit
[1:03:54] he asked the individual he said i see
[1:03:57] all of this that you have
[1:03:58] he said but i want to know how much do
[1:04:01] you own up there
[1:04:04] because all this will fade
[1:04:07] everything else will fade everything
[1:04:09] else will go away quickly
[1:04:11] is that right this is why that is to be
[1:04:14] the number one priority brother brown
[1:04:16] would open the message proving his word
[1:04:18] the very the second or third paragraph
[1:04:20] there in jeffersonville and he'd say
[1:04:22] it's the time
[1:04:23] to turn loose of everything else
[1:04:27] and cleave to the word of god don't let
[1:04:30] anything get between you
[1:04:32] and god you recognize it is your life
[1:04:35] my life it is contingent maturity
[1:04:38] is not an automatic given thing it is
[1:04:41] contingent
[1:04:42] upon abiding in him
[1:04:46] in his presence
[1:04:49] it's contingent it's not an automatic
[1:04:52] it's abiding in his
[1:04:54] presence so we don't want to divide it
[1:04:56] hard we we have to take
[1:04:58] counsel within these things even how
[1:05:00] paul would instruct
[1:05:01] uh you know within uh homes and
[1:05:04] marriages and
[1:05:05] everything else and paul would say that
[1:05:07] you would attend
[1:05:08] unto the lord without distraction
[1:05:15] there's things that has to be done but
[1:05:18] there's things that can be done
[1:05:20] without compromising the order if this
[1:05:23] is bothering then then get me a mic or
[1:05:25] something
[1:05:26] there there is there is an order that
[1:05:29] god has for things
[1:05:30] this is why you could say using this
[1:05:32] world same chapter
[1:05:34] without abusing it understand we're not
[1:05:38] here
[1:05:39] we're not here to you know that my that
[1:05:41] i'm to be so absorbed in this life
[1:05:44] that's not the purpose of god
[1:05:47] the purpose of god is to be absorbed
[1:05:51] in him and by him
[1:05:57] glory be to god in the highest you see
[1:06:00] now let me just lay this in here god had
[1:06:03] plucked up this vine
[1:06:05] he brought it out of egypt that's what
[1:06:06] that's what david is referring back to
[1:06:08] the vine
[1:06:09] you brought it out of egypt and you put
[1:06:11] it in a good place
[1:06:12] they were god's chosen they were already
[1:06:15] a vine of god even when they were in
[1:06:18] egypt
[1:06:19] egypt didn't make them not a vine of god
[1:06:23] it's just egypt was not a place
[1:06:26] that the vine of god could actually
[1:06:29] reveal
[1:06:30] or manifest itself as the vine of god
[1:06:34] just just when we see this somehow that
[1:06:37] god would move it
[1:06:38] he says brother brown would say like
[1:06:40] this i'm just referring i don't have
[1:06:41] these to display
[1:06:42] if a good vine isn't set in good ground
[1:06:46] it will not bring forth good fruits it
[1:06:48] depends on where the vine is planted
[1:06:51] it will determine the results of the
[1:06:53] crop
[1:06:54] so god picked israel out of a barren
[1:06:57] ground
[1:06:59] they were always a vine of god but they
[1:07:01] weren't bearing
[1:07:03] the fruit or witness through their life
[1:07:06] that they were a vine of god so what did
[1:07:09] god have to do
[1:07:10] god had to come and bring them from
[1:07:13] where they were
[1:07:14] and place them in good ground
[1:07:19] is that right so we find that within
[1:07:21] this
[1:07:22] you know this is what brother graham
[1:07:23] says you find many times he said
[1:07:26] good people but they're planted in the
[1:07:28] wrong place
[1:07:30] he said you find people that he said are
[1:07:32] catholics or presbyterian or
[1:07:34] that's the church that they're
[1:07:35] affiliated with it might even be some
[1:07:37] message church
[1:07:38] but he says they're planted in the wrong
[1:07:40] place
[1:07:42] well i'm going to preach anyhow they're
[1:07:44] planted in the wrong place
[1:07:46] there's no joy brother brahma identifies
[1:07:48] it no spiritual
[1:07:50] joy come on that's one of the that's one
[1:07:53] of the places there
[1:07:54] when those four those four powers
[1:07:57] came those four uh uh
[1:08:00] that same insect and through the four
[1:08:03] stages it took away
[1:08:04] and it ate away at the tree of the
[1:08:07] living god is that right
[1:08:08] they then had no meat or no meal
[1:08:11] offering or drink offering
[1:08:13] and when they themselves had no fruit to
[1:08:16] give to god to come and wash up
[1:08:18] that's what it was it was having
[1:08:21] something that they could come and
[1:08:22] worship
[1:08:25] come on now i'm not talking come and
[1:08:27] worship it i'm talking about
[1:08:29] coming with substance in your life
[1:08:32] there is fruit in your life there's a
[1:08:34] joy in your life
[1:08:36] i'm telling you this message is not a
[1:08:38] letter this
[1:08:39] message is the person of jesus christ
[1:08:42] revealed in this generation it
[1:08:45] brings the joy of the lord to the church
[1:08:49] of the living god it brings joy to a
[1:08:51] life
[1:08:52] when it's preached in by the same spirit
[1:08:56] and the author of life himself who is
[1:08:58] the life
[1:08:59] giver to the church of the living god
[1:09:02] how can you not see what god is doing
[1:09:04] it can there not be things going on in
[1:09:06] your life and you don't have joy
[1:09:09] but the reason joy stops is when there's
[1:09:11] a departure from the word
[1:09:15] joy ceases is that right
[1:09:18] you see good people brother ramble say
[1:09:20] good people he said but they're planted
[1:09:22] in the wrong place a ginger wine vine of
[1:09:25] god big now what he says
[1:09:26] planted in the wrong place because
[1:09:29] there's something within them that's
[1:09:30] stirring
[1:09:33] there's something within there that they
[1:09:35] can't even explain
[1:09:36] you you know how it was you see i was
[1:09:39] right here within the church but
[1:09:40] some of you come out of denominations
[1:09:42] and organizations and and you realize
[1:09:44] there was more for you
[1:09:46] well let me get right down and preach on
[1:09:47] those of us and say that that warm
[1:09:49] message pews
[1:09:50] we realized there was more than just
[1:09:51] coming to church
[1:09:53] we realized there was more than just
[1:09:55] well brother brown's a prophet
[1:09:56] or my daddy's this or my mama's this or
[1:09:59] or i know this brother or
[1:10:00] or i slept in this tent back we know
[1:10:02] there's more than that
[1:10:04] we know that this message came to bring
[1:10:06] a meeting
[1:10:07] with us and god that god would unite
[1:10:12] with his people it's not a club it's not
[1:10:15] a lodge
[1:10:16] it's not a membership it is a body
[1:10:19] that we are burst into by the holy ghost
[1:10:25] amen it can be a good good people
[1:10:29] just planted in the wrong place so i'm
[1:10:31] going to just
[1:10:32] say this the ground matters
[1:10:36] the ground matters now you know i you
[1:10:39] know that most of you know i enjoy
[1:10:41] planting things
[1:10:42] i enjoy you know tending to things and
[1:10:45] things like that i'm not a master
[1:10:46] gardener by
[1:10:47] no means whatsoever but i know there's
[1:10:50] certain places where you should plant
[1:10:52] stuff and where you shouldn't
[1:10:54] i know there's certain soil and i've
[1:10:55] experienced that just sometimes because
[1:10:57] of failure with things
[1:10:59] sometimes the way the light comes in
[1:11:01] does it get enough light and
[1:11:02] those of you know whether tomato plants
[1:11:04] or whatever it is you ground
[1:11:06] matters now i want to just say this to
[1:11:09] you when we talk of ground in the
[1:11:10] scripture we are talking of this
[1:11:13] here we we look at two and i don't want
[1:11:15] to say two places
[1:11:17] but we can look at two things first of
[1:11:19] all the scripture would talk about
[1:11:21] good ground in terms of where the seed
[1:11:24] is sown
[1:11:25] and good ground meaning that where that
[1:11:27] word is sown some is on stony ground and
[1:11:29] and some you know on the other three
[1:11:31] types of ground but then
[1:11:32] there is good ground good ground is that
[1:11:36] of the predestinated seed womb
[1:11:39] of god but that good ground that part of
[1:11:43] it
[1:11:43] that's not what i'm focused on right now
[1:11:46] but you get that ground
[1:11:47] in the right ground you get that seed in
[1:11:50] the right ground and that red ground
[1:11:53] is christ because it's in him
[1:11:56] it's it's in him he is the ordained
[1:11:59] ground where believers belong
[1:12:03] he's the ordained ground that lets you
[1:12:06] and i know
[1:12:06] you always were a son and daughter of
[1:12:09] god
[1:12:10] it's nothing you did to make yourself a
[1:12:12] son and daughter of god
[1:12:14] you always were you weren't a dog become
[1:12:16] a sheep or i was a honorary pig become a
[1:12:18] sheep
[1:12:19] no you always were but you couldn't
[1:12:22] be recognized in egypt you had to come
[1:12:27] into the good ground
[1:12:30] and the good ground is christ himself
[1:12:35] the word it has all the nutrients
[1:12:40] that's needed for the hour
[1:12:44] you get in this good ground it don't
[1:12:46] have to be patted on the back and
[1:12:48] you know little cutesy spray here and
[1:12:50] promise you this if you come to church
[1:12:52] or
[1:12:52] if you do it no sir you're not in the
[1:12:54] good ground yet
[1:12:56] but when you get in the good ground you
[1:12:58] put your feelings in your pocket and
[1:12:59] your soul on the altar
[1:13:02] come on friends it's time to lay aside
[1:13:04] feelings
[1:13:05] all the complexes where everything's
[1:13:07] always everybody else's fault
[1:13:08] it's time to start looking in the mirror
[1:13:10] and say god
[1:13:11] bring a change lord bring a dissolving
[1:13:15] in my life oh my
[1:13:18] psalms 1 1 blessed is the man let's look
[1:13:20] at this ground a minute
[1:13:22] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:13:24] the counsel
[1:13:25] of the ungodly so he's not there
[1:13:30] with the ungodly what are the ungodly
[1:13:32] those that speak
[1:13:33] against the word
[1:13:36] god called them wicked when they raised
[1:13:38] their tongue against moses
[1:13:40] corey and dathan they might have been
[1:13:42] you know they might have won citizen of
[1:13:44] the year awards but when they stood
[1:13:45] against the revealed word of the hour
[1:13:47] god called them wicked is that right
[1:13:50] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:13:52] the counsel
[1:13:53] of the ungodly come on we we shouldn't
[1:13:57] be under the influence of this world
[1:14:00] if you find yourself being a channel to
[1:14:03] echo
[1:14:03] all of their sentiments you need to get
[1:14:06] out of the counsel of the ungodly
[1:14:07] your voice was not meant to be a voice
[1:14:10] that pumps all this voice from the world
[1:14:12] and all this divisive air
[1:14:14] you weren't meant to be a political
[1:14:15] voice you weren't meant
[1:14:17] how can you let yourself be so low as to
[1:14:20] get in the counsel of the ungodly
[1:14:22] we are called we are called to a liberty
[1:14:25] to be a voice of almighty god there is
[1:14:28] one promised land
[1:14:30] there is one hope and that is in jesus
[1:14:33] christ
[1:14:35] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[1:14:39] you know a person can say i've been in
[1:14:40] the way a long time and they're right
[1:14:42] they've been in the way of everybody
[1:14:45] they stood in the way of everybody
[1:14:46] complained and everything else
[1:14:48] but don't stand in the way of sinners he
[1:14:51] does not standeth in the way of sinners
[1:14:53] he does not
[1:14:54] that is not his fellowship
[1:14:58] come on now nor sitteth in the seat
[1:15:01] of the scornful those conditions i just
[1:15:05] read are all egypt
[1:15:08] egypt is not a place babylon is not a
[1:15:12] place
[1:15:12] it's a condition
[1:15:15] hallelujah but his delight verse 2
[1:15:19] in the law of the lord his delight is in
[1:15:22] the law of the lord
[1:15:23] and in his law doth he meditate day
[1:15:26] and night this individual
[1:15:30] is consumed with god
[1:15:37] you know when you meditate on god he
[1:15:39] draws near
[1:15:41] he draws an ear god told joshua
[1:15:45] meditate on it
[1:15:48] amen because what you dwell on
[1:15:52] you find when you meditate on the word
[1:15:54] begin to take it in you say brother
[1:15:55] simon i'm just too busy then you're too
[1:15:57] busy
[1:16:00] to meditate on the word of god
[1:16:05] it brings his presence there's things
[1:16:07] that god begins to open and god begins
[1:16:10] to reveal this is part of
[1:16:12] delighting thyself in the lord
[1:16:16] verse three and he shall be like a tree
[1:16:19] planted
[1:16:20] by the rivers of water that bringeth
[1:16:22] forth
[1:16:23] his fruit in his season
[1:16:28] his leaf also shall not wither and
[1:16:31] whatsoever he doeth
[1:16:33] shall prosper why because of where
[1:16:37] he's planted he's not just set out he's
[1:16:39] planted
[1:16:40] you see god already this planting
[1:16:43] is god is already has the ordained place
[1:16:47] in our life our the ordained place is
[1:16:50] to be planted by the river the rivers
[1:16:54] of living water one water
[1:16:57] but many rivers one god
[1:17:01] flowing out there are nine spiritual
[1:17:03] gifts
[1:17:04] one god flowing out through the church
[1:17:06] of the living god he is a tree
[1:17:08] that is planted not just set out but is
[1:17:11] implanted
[1:17:12] and is established and the joy of the
[1:17:15] lord
[1:17:15] is pulsating through that life bringing
[1:17:19] forth
[1:17:19] his fruit whose fruit god's fruit in
[1:17:23] his season who's his season the
[1:17:25] prophet's season
[1:17:26] when god sends his prophet because
[1:17:30] the prophet is one who comes with
[1:17:33] the word to call forth this is the hour
[1:17:37] this is the time this is our
[1:17:40] season
[1:17:43] glory be to god in the highest think of
[1:17:46] this here
[1:17:47] let me just let me move on here we see
[1:17:50] this that within it
[1:17:52] there are many other places that i could
[1:17:54] refer to within this part
[1:17:57] but this good ground as we're saying
[1:18:00] it is by once period we are baptized
[1:18:04] into this choice place which is christ
[1:18:06] which is the word
[1:18:08] this is where paul would write that
[1:18:11] in in ephesians of where he hath blessed
[1:18:14] us with all
[1:18:15] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:18:19] in christ and he would go on to say for
[1:18:23] all the promises of god
[1:18:25] in him are yea and amen
[1:18:29] is that right now when we think back to
[1:18:32] this so
[1:18:33] we recognize there must be that of the
[1:18:37] good ground and so when we think of this
[1:18:42] israel as david is is expressing this by
[1:18:46] the spirit of god
[1:18:48] i want to say like this there is
[1:18:50] something
[1:18:51] more that was needed than just
[1:18:55] god just to bring them back
[1:18:58] into the land because they were already
[1:19:00] in the land of israel
[1:19:03] they needed something more let me just
[1:19:05] say what i'm what i'm what i'm trying to
[1:19:07] say
[1:19:08] they needed more than just to have
[1:19:10] another
[1:19:11] repeat or another cycle where they come
[1:19:14] back
[1:19:15] and you know they come back and remember
[1:19:16] they would cry out to god and god would
[1:19:18] send them
[1:19:19] you know a judge god would raise up an
[1:19:21] individual
[1:19:22] and they would you know begin to cry out
[1:19:24] to god and and god would deliver them
[1:19:26] and then after a period of time here
[1:19:27] they are right back in the
[1:19:28] in in doing the same things that that
[1:19:30] god brought them out of you know they
[1:19:32] they needed something more
[1:19:35] and this is what david the spirit of god
[1:19:37] is expressing through david which
[1:19:40] holds a great type for our life and
[1:19:43] where you and i are at in this hour
[1:19:45] when we look at in each one of the other
[1:19:48] seven ages that has went forth
[1:19:51] when the church entered the very first
[1:19:54] church age
[1:19:54] she was already a fallen woman is that
[1:19:57] right
[1:19:58] remember from whence thou hast fallen
[1:20:01] right where did they fall from pentecost
[1:20:05] is that right they fell away from the
[1:20:07] original power
[1:20:09] and authority and glory
[1:20:12] then you find down through the age as it
[1:20:14] comes into
[1:20:16] a dark age and here you find
[1:20:19] that the bride is cut down the bride
[1:20:22] tree is cut down
[1:20:23] and the life goes into the ground
[1:20:27] in the satire age it goes where does the
[1:20:29] seed have to go
[1:20:30] into dirt the denominations is the dirt
[1:20:36] come on now you know i don't you know
[1:20:37] i'm quoting i'm speaking of these things
[1:20:40] it goes right into the dirt but then it
[1:20:43] begins to come up
[1:20:44] and that in luther it begins to sprout
[1:20:46] forth
[1:20:47] then it comes a little bit more and
[1:20:48] wesley then here we find it now
[1:20:51] at the beginning of the lady you'll see
[1:20:52] an age we find the restoration of the
[1:20:54] gifts
[1:20:55] where pentecost the supernatural is
[1:20:57] beginning to return
[1:20:59] to the church of the living god what's
[1:21:01] god doing god is making
[1:21:03] a way for himself to come fully
[1:21:07] into his church
[1:21:10] glory be to god so when it would come
[1:21:13] back into this moment because we're even
[1:21:16] under luther
[1:21:17] there are things that luther himself
[1:21:20] being a reformer
[1:21:21] not a prophet that luther himself even
[1:21:23] got tangled up with things
[1:21:25] there are things you find even with
[1:21:27] wesley they're things that you find even
[1:21:29] among even though they were messengers
[1:21:32] of god but they can only
[1:21:34] they could only speak according to the
[1:21:37] light
[1:21:37] of the word that was revealed for that
[1:21:40] hour
[1:21:41] you know how it is right now you can't
[1:21:43] take that our plants cannot take
[1:21:45] the intensity of the august sun right
[1:21:47] now
[1:21:48] it's got to come into that place
[1:21:51] to be able to handle that light
[1:21:54] though the plants are calling out more
[1:21:57] light more light
[1:21:58] more light but it can only handle the
[1:22:01] certain intensity
[1:22:02] and that's the way it has been with the
[1:22:05] program of almighty god
[1:22:06] the bible says that the path of the
[1:22:08] justice as a
[1:22:10] shining light that shines brighter and
[1:22:12] brighter and brighter
[1:22:13] unto that perfect day so hear the word
[1:22:18] itself to come into a place in this hour
[1:22:22] we've not come to a station we've not
[1:22:25] come to a point that
[1:22:26] when we got to this point that's not
[1:22:28] where we're at
[1:22:29] the message that god has sent to you and
[1:22:32] i
[1:22:32] in this hour we have been united
[1:22:36] with jesus christ in his fullness it is
[1:22:39] the revealing of the son of man
[1:22:41] back in the church of the living god
[1:22:44] this way i can say rejoice
[1:22:46] and be glad and make merry for the
[1:22:49] marriage
[1:22:49] of the lamb has come and his wife
[1:22:53] hath made herself ready it's time not
[1:22:56] just to the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:58] it's time it's the baptism of the holy
[1:23:01] ghost
[1:23:02] moving out into my father's house there
[1:23:05] are
[1:23:05] many mansions
[1:23:07] [Applause]
[1:23:08] glory be to god we're here in the time
[1:23:12] there's something something was needed
[1:23:15] something greater
[1:23:18] because each stage of the of the plant
[1:23:21] itself it died has the life moved on
[1:23:24] it's got to come back the whole the
[1:23:26] whole part it must come back
[1:23:28] to the original planting it must come
[1:23:31] back
[1:23:31] to the grain again is that right
[1:23:37] so something more was needed this is why
[1:23:40] david
[1:23:42] as he would say in verse 14 return
[1:23:45] we beseech thee oh god of host
[1:23:50] look down from heaven and behold and
[1:23:51] visit this vine and the vineyard
[1:23:53] which thy right hand hath planted and
[1:23:55] the branch which thou hath made us
[1:23:57] strong for thyself god had brought him
[1:24:00] out of egypt
[1:24:02] he had put him in a in a good land the
[1:24:04] choice land i'm talking about
[1:24:06] in the natural through that first exodus
[1:24:08] he brought them out of egypt
[1:24:10] brought him into the land of promise and
[1:24:12] what lay
[1:24:13] in their life remember their mothers
[1:24:18] you take leah and uh rachel
[1:24:21] here they were and others as they were
[1:24:23] giving birth
[1:24:25] to the children there of jacob
[1:24:28] they would call out the name and it was
[1:24:31] the inspiration of
[1:24:33] god coming down that gave him utterance
[1:24:36] of that name and in that name laid
[1:24:40] the mystery of their life he laid their
[1:24:42] position laid the identity
[1:24:45] of who they really were
[1:24:50] why when certain ones among them the
[1:24:52] different ones they certainly like
[1:24:53] certain delicacies
[1:24:55] and this one over here saying no we're a
[1:24:57] cattle well god weren't interested in
[1:24:58] making the cattle raisers you know
[1:25:00] delicacy people
[1:25:01] you know bakers and flowers on top and
[1:25:04] all that god wasn't interested in that
[1:25:06] neither did he want the bakers to become
[1:25:08] farmers
[1:25:10] god wanted them to abide every man in
[1:25:12] his own calling
[1:25:13] amen that god would unfold and what he
[1:25:16] had shown up in that life
[1:25:18] once they got into the choice crown the
[1:25:21] mystery
[1:25:21] that was in their life would actually be
[1:25:24] unfolded
[1:25:27] god planted them in a good ground as a
[1:25:30] matter of fact brother bram said
[1:25:31] he soaked the ground of palestine with
[1:25:34] the blood
[1:25:35] of heifers and and and lambs
[1:25:39] but that blood was not sufficient
[1:25:44] it was only a type it was only speaking
[1:25:48] there was going to come a blood
[1:25:53] where this vine of god would be able to
[1:25:55] stand
[1:25:57] in the presence of god justified
[1:26:01] would be able to stand there identified
[1:26:05] in a blood that has so changed their
[1:26:07] life
[1:26:08] they would be able to stand there with
[1:26:10] the confidence not looking over their
[1:26:13] back
[1:26:13] but a confidence that causes them to
[1:26:15] look forward because the past
[1:26:18] is not only behind them it's been done
[1:26:19] away with
[1:26:23] amen and no one could do it but god
[1:26:26] himself
[1:26:28] god didn't send the second man down god
[1:26:31] came himself
[1:26:35] hallelujah god didn't send the secretary
[1:26:37] down god claimed himself
[1:26:39] let me just say in every generation god
[1:26:42] has not sent a secretary
[1:26:44] god has brought himself on the scene
[1:26:50] just in case you forgot you didn't bring
[1:26:52] him into your life
[1:26:53] he brought himself in there
[1:26:57] you didn't get good enough to bring him
[1:26:59] in he brought his self in
[1:27:01] he provided what was needed so that your
[1:27:04] life
[1:27:04] might be a place that he could come and
[1:27:06] dwell
[1:27:07] in hallelujah
[1:27:12] oh my no wonder here let me read a few
[1:27:14] of the prophecies that not only
[1:27:16] would pertain to israel coming in the
[1:27:17] land in the natural
[1:27:19] but where god would take them because of
[1:27:21] what they needed they needed something
[1:27:23] greater and
[1:27:23] in exodus 15 when you know moses got a
[1:27:26] little
[1:27:27] pentecostal there moses got to
[1:27:31] you know he said you know what there
[1:27:33] ain't a song
[1:27:34] there's got to be a new song on this one
[1:27:38] oh lord notice this in exodus 15
[1:27:41] 17 thou shalt bring them in
[1:27:44] and plant them in the mountain of thine
[1:27:47] inheritance
[1:27:48] in the place oh lord which thou hast
[1:27:51] made for thee to dwell in in the
[1:27:54] sanctuary oh lord
[1:27:55] which thy hands have established
[1:27:59] the lord shall reign forever and ever
[1:28:02] notice even in the face of what would
[1:28:04] just taken place
[1:28:06] god was not only speaking he would bring
[1:28:08] israel in
[1:28:09] naturally into that land but god was
[1:28:12] speaking
[1:28:13] there would be a bride on earth that he
[1:28:15] himself
[1:28:16] would cause us to pass through the red
[1:28:18] sea
[1:28:19] he would bring us into the place that we
[1:28:22] were to be planted in
[1:28:23] and it also spoke of when god himself
[1:28:26] will bring israel
[1:28:27] and establish israel in that land
[1:28:31] of christ himself
[1:28:34] glory be to god i can say it like this
[1:28:37] there is a place
[1:28:39] if you've been up and down and in and
[1:28:41] out and everything else there's a place
[1:28:43] that you can climb into in christ to
[1:28:45] where your faith
[1:28:47] now becomes energized operated by
[1:28:50] on by the very power of god where it's
[1:28:53] no longer
[1:28:54] your faith but now it's the faith of the
[1:28:56] son of god
[1:28:57] it's a victory in your life there's a
[1:29:00] place to climb into
[1:29:02] in him a place to be planted in him
[1:29:06] god says here speaking of him himself as
[1:29:08] he will
[1:29:09] bring them in the 144 000 but this
[1:29:12] applies to us look what he says
[1:29:14] amos 9 14 and i will bring again the
[1:29:16] captivity of my people of israel
[1:29:18] and they shall build the waste cities
[1:29:20] and inhabit them
[1:29:22] god don't want new things
[1:29:25] god wants build up what was already
[1:29:28] there
[1:29:30] i'm not talking about the fallen
[1:29:31] condition i'm talking about
[1:29:33] that god himself he said i will restore
[1:29:39] when isaac was down there in career the
[1:29:42] spirit of god
[1:29:43] moved upon his heart and he began to dig
[1:29:45] the wells that his father
[1:29:47] abraham dug and he called him under the
[1:29:49] same name i'm telling you
[1:29:51] we are not digging in foreign places but
[1:29:53] god
[1:29:54] has spoke to us in this hour and he
[1:29:57] directed us right back into the word
[1:29:59] we're not trying to find new things out
[1:30:01] here but it's digging
[1:30:02] into the wells of the word we find out
[1:30:05] of that truth of predestination
[1:30:08] we find out the reality of the baptism
[1:30:10] of the holy ghost
[1:30:12] we find out the living realities of the
[1:30:14] living god why
[1:30:16] we're digging in the same places that
[1:30:18] abraham does we're digging in the same
[1:30:21] places
[1:30:22] that paul dug peter doug
[1:30:26] hallelujah
[1:30:30] might i say it we're digging in the same
[1:30:32] places
[1:30:33] where brother random dug
[1:30:35] [Applause]
[1:30:38] our father in the gospel and i will
[1:30:41] notice
[1:30:42] inhabit them and you shall plant
[1:30:44] vineyards and drink the wine thereof
[1:30:46] they shall also make gardens and eat the
[1:30:48] fruit of them
[1:30:49] and i will plant them upon their land
[1:30:53] and they shall no more be pulled out of
[1:30:55] their land
[1:30:56] which i have given them saith the lord
[1:30:58] god
[1:31:01] when god plants something here because
[1:31:04] in the natural the natural in itself
[1:31:08] could not hold on because the life
[1:31:11] there wasn't no life in the blood that
[1:31:14] could coincide
[1:31:16] or come back upon the worshipper and
[1:31:18] bring a change
[1:31:19] in their life this is why when god
[1:31:23] has done a planting in a life it's no
[1:31:25] longer
[1:31:26] well i don't know if i'm gonna make it i
[1:31:29] don't know if i can hold on
[1:31:31] it ain't about whether you can make it
[1:31:32] or whether you can hold on it's christ
[1:31:34] in you it's a pulsation of his life your
[1:31:37] desires of the world
[1:31:39] have fled from your life he is your
[1:31:42] desire
[1:31:49] thy people isaiah 60 verse 21 thy people
[1:31:52] also now this
[1:31:53] even speaking of this time that god will
[1:31:55] bring them in thy people also shall be
[1:31:58] all righteous they shall inherit the
[1:32:01] land forever
[1:32:02] the branch of my planting the work of my
[1:32:04] hands
[1:32:05] that i may be glorified
[1:32:12] i don't have time to preach on this but
[1:32:14] do you realize even in the time of the
[1:32:15] millennium it's a memorial
[1:32:18] we're under the feast of tabernacles and
[1:32:20] god is going to display
[1:32:22] to those who are raised up because we
[1:32:25] will raise up those
[1:32:26] who've not heard the gospel come on it's
[1:32:28] a direct quote
[1:32:30] that ain't out of the scripture that's
[1:32:31] all the way through the old testament
[1:32:33] and god will point out here here they
[1:32:36] were there will be a
[1:32:37] declaration in that hour that what i
[1:32:39] said back here
[1:32:41] i have fulfilled it amen and we will
[1:32:44] teach them the ways of the god of jacob
[1:32:47] come on now blessed be the name of the
[1:32:50] lord oh my
[1:32:51] i can't even i can't even get into that
[1:32:53] but you understand
[1:32:55] see god has a way this is why god does
[1:32:57] the same thing in your life right now
[1:32:59] when your life where people said they'll
[1:33:01] never get over this
[1:33:02] they'll never get free of this oh boy
[1:33:04] they're really twisted up now
[1:33:06] man look at their life and whatever more
[1:33:08] but god take a life
[1:33:09] where the world has wrote it off and the
[1:33:11] world says there's no way
[1:33:13] and even you think in your heart there's
[1:33:15] no way but there's something beneath the
[1:33:18] darkness
[1:33:19] that's calling out and god moves down
[1:33:22] and he takes a life
[1:33:23] that yields itself in his hand and god
[1:33:25] says this
[1:33:27] is the kind of trophies and lives
[1:33:30] that i make my reputation on
[1:33:36] anybody know what i'm talking about
[1:33:40] god can put his hand upon our life and
[1:33:42] say he's glorified and alive
[1:33:44] a life that was rolled off a life that
[1:33:47] maybe was headed for skid row or
[1:33:49] whatever it might be headed for hell we
[1:33:51] were going in that direction
[1:33:53] we didn't know we had a position in this
[1:33:56] land
[1:33:56] we did not know who we really were but
[1:33:59] god came by our way
[1:34:02] there was something more that had to
[1:34:05] happen in our life
[1:34:09] we had to meet him
[1:34:18] israel was not in egypt naturally now
[1:34:21] where david is speaking of they're not
[1:34:23] even in egypt naturally now
[1:34:26] they were in egypt spiritually
[1:34:30] they needed deliverance they needed a
[1:34:33] visitation
[1:34:34] from the lord you see
[1:34:38] it got to come down to the right
[1:34:39] conditions
[1:34:41] must be the right conditions
[1:34:44] you see god
[1:34:48] he works on both ends
[1:34:52] god help me to bring this he works on
[1:34:55] both ends
[1:34:57] before god could send israel or moses
[1:35:00] back down to egypt with a message
[1:35:02] that the people had to be ready to
[1:35:04] receive
[1:35:07] they weren't ready at first
[1:35:11] so god had to get moses out and prepare
[1:35:14] him and we know all that but see
[1:35:16] then when it comes back they had to be
[1:35:18] ready
[1:35:20] those are the right conditions it takes
[1:35:23] god brother brown would tell us an
[1:35:24] invisible union
[1:35:25] he said when you take a people that goes
[1:35:28] to longing
[1:35:29] to line up with the word he said god
[1:35:33] will send a message at that time
[1:35:35] to bring those people in line
[1:35:38] where did that longing come from
[1:35:44] well you know my daddy my mama no
[1:35:48] it was sunday school my sunday school
[1:35:49] teacher was soaked no
[1:35:54] where did that longing come from
[1:35:58] it come from god he was placed
[1:36:02] in your heart in that seed
[1:36:05] there was a longing may i borrow the
[1:36:07] words of the prophet a minute
[1:36:09] amen and god rich in mercy he said how
[1:36:12] many of you can fellowship with me on
[1:36:13] this thought
[1:36:14] you are a young boy a young girl and
[1:36:17] there was something calling inside of
[1:36:19] your heart
[1:36:19] there's got to be a god somewhere
[1:36:22] there's got to be a reality somewhere
[1:36:24] you might have been sitting in a church
[1:36:25] somewhere where but there's there's
[1:36:27] something about
[1:36:27] there's a longing there's a longing what
[1:36:30] is it that's what god has placed within
[1:36:32] you
[1:36:33] that only he can satisfy that's why you
[1:36:35] can never just stop
[1:36:36] with this or that or this or that
[1:36:38] there's a longing because there is a
[1:36:39] place
[1:36:40] that you are ordained to be planted in
[1:36:45] and the prophet simply called it this he
[1:36:47] said that's the foreknowledge of
[1:36:49] god taking place in your life
[1:36:52] hallelujah just as god called israel
[1:36:56] back from this nation and this nation
[1:36:58] and this nation
[1:36:59] and this nation it's the same god by the
[1:37:02] sounding
[1:37:03] of his word in this hour that you and i
[1:37:06] are living in
[1:37:07] it's a call that's going out it's a draw
[1:37:10] that's going out what's it pulling you
[1:37:12] to not a church
[1:37:14] not a personality but he is gathering
[1:37:17] all things unto himself
[1:37:23] hallelujah the right conditions
[1:37:28] these things here within this moment
[1:37:32] and god works in that life to bring it
[1:37:35] to the right condition think think of
[1:37:37] here of
[1:37:40] of of of of rebecca
[1:37:43] here within this
[1:37:48] here eliezer shows up
[1:37:55] and here comes rebecca out
[1:38:00] this is not a coincidence
[1:38:03] it's evening time
[1:38:07] it's evening time it's evening time for
[1:38:10] the church of the living god
[1:38:13] it's evening time it's the time for
[1:38:16] the bride of isaac
[1:38:22] and here she comes out to the to the
[1:38:24] well and she begins to draw water
[1:38:28] eliezer doesn't have to prompt her
[1:38:33] she sees this and she says i'll draw can
[1:38:36] i'll draw water for your camels also
[1:38:44] god brother bradman says it like this
[1:38:47] the angel of the lord beat
[1:38:50] the servant of the lord there 30
[1:38:54] minutes before he got there
[1:38:58] to deal with her heart i'm telling you
[1:39:00] that same angel the lord
[1:39:02] it's not only on earth he's here
[1:39:06] [Applause]
[1:39:07] that same angel of the lord that deals
[1:39:09] with your heart deals with my heart
[1:39:11] even before the word is coming forth in
[1:39:13] his presence to mature us
[1:39:15] he has him that is moving upon our
[1:39:18] hearts
[1:39:23] i'm just going to stop there today
[1:39:27] but i'm going to speak a little bit more
[1:39:34] i think of how brother branham as he
[1:39:36] comes into
[1:39:38] go pray for sister georgie carter
[1:39:42] he comes into this place
[1:39:46] he's got to pass through south boston
[1:39:48] and you know at one point it's called
[1:39:49] new boston whatever
[1:39:53] i went through that place last year and
[1:39:55] when there's no stoplight there it's
[1:39:57] i mean it's literally it's like um well
[1:40:00] i don't even know
[1:40:01] how to even compare it it's just like a
[1:40:03] little
[1:40:04] gas station or whatever it was there but
[1:40:05] it's just it's very old
[1:40:08] there's nothing i mean and you're just
[1:40:10] corn fields right there
[1:40:11] you know it just but remember
[1:40:15] brother brown was going along in that
[1:40:17] vision
[1:40:19] of where this lamb was crying out
[1:40:22] here he's got to come to that place in
[1:40:26] south boston
[1:40:29] and here's a man with
[1:40:32] to be to come out to him and that man
[1:40:34] supposed to tell him where
[1:40:36] her house is
[1:40:40] god could have told the prophet
[1:40:42] everything right
[1:40:43] i mean when we're thinking he's here
[1:40:45] here god would pick him up
[1:40:47] right as he stood here in this dimension
[1:40:50] but show him in another dimension
[1:40:54] and he would hear prayers being prayed
[1:40:56] and what brother brown said
[1:40:57] that's the land called prayer prayers
[1:41:00] that you think god
[1:41:01] oh god ain't hurt no he said they're out
[1:41:03] there it's his words
[1:41:04] it's right out there in a land called
[1:41:06] prayer
[1:41:12] and here god is directing him
[1:41:16] and he almost passes it up he passes up
[1:41:19] his turn
[1:41:20] he starts feeling checked he gets out of
[1:41:23] the car you know
[1:41:24] puts his foot on the bumper takes off
[1:41:26] his hat and he says god
[1:41:28] i feel this way this strange way and as
[1:41:30] he's praying he looks up and he
[1:41:32] that's the graveyard back there i was
[1:41:34] supposed to turn down that road
[1:41:36] god is in control
[1:41:43] to me these are more than visions amen
[1:41:46] about georgie carter these are more than
[1:41:48] visions these are things that god shows
[1:41:50] you and i
[1:41:50] this is how i lead my people
[1:41:54] if you keep your eyes on me there are
[1:41:56] certain things and you're sensitive to
[1:41:58] me
[1:41:58] and pay attention to what i'm telling
[1:42:00] you and come out and don't override it
[1:42:02] brother branham had overrode it and kept
[1:42:04] on going
[1:42:05] he would have missed a sign that he
[1:42:07] needed to be pay attention to
[1:42:09] because that sign would tell him get off
[1:42:10] of this road and go down that road
[1:42:16] here he comes into south boston or new
[1:42:18] boston he comes into this place
[1:42:23] he pulls they pull up there he tells
[1:42:25] them and he tells them in the car and
[1:42:26] says
[1:42:27] now there's going to be a guy come out
[1:42:28] of this little store coming up here
[1:42:31] he's wearing bibbed overhauls yellow
[1:42:33] overhauls or whatever and
[1:42:34] he's supposed to tell me where to go
[1:42:38] the man didn't know that
[1:42:41] but god knew it
[1:42:44] the man didn't know he was in the vision
[1:42:46] god knew he was in the vision
[1:42:51] you didn't know you were in the vision
[1:42:52] of the word but god knew you're in the
[1:42:54] vision of the word
[1:42:55] [Applause]
[1:43:00] right conditions it's god working and
[1:43:03] here the man comes out
[1:43:04] of that store about the time as the
[1:43:07] prophet is pulling up there
[1:43:08] and he comes across the street brother
[1:43:10] brandon rolls down the window
[1:43:12] he said sir you're to tell me where
[1:43:15] the house of carter is at and the man
[1:43:18] begins to talk
[1:43:19] and he starts crying and brother brahms
[1:43:21] said what it was he didn't know
[1:43:23] he was in the vision but the effect of
[1:43:25] the vision
[1:43:26] being fulfilled brought that reaction
[1:43:29] in his life i'm telling you we're under
[1:43:33] the effect
[1:43:34] of the vision of the word in this hour
[1:43:38] it's having an effect upon our lives
[1:43:42] we didn't know we were in the vision but
[1:43:45] god knew we were in the vision
[1:43:46] god saw you and i marching right in step
[1:43:50] with the word of almighty god
[1:43:53] we didn't know it but god knew we were
[1:43:55] in the vision
[1:43:56] and now it's the effect of the vision
[1:44:00] of the word
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:03] in our life will stand
[1:44:14] if i be lifted up he said i'll draw
[1:44:18] all men unto me
[1:44:22] there's an inward drawing that's taking
[1:44:24] place
[1:44:30] hallelujah even as every head is bowed i
[1:44:33] just stopped there
[1:44:38] i just admonished you this if you've
[1:44:41] never come into that place yet

[1:45:00] invitation

[1:46:05] under your presence in my life lord
[1:46:08] continuing to mature
[1:46:10] and mature and mature
[1:46:14] oh my think of what happened when cain
[1:46:16] was confronted with his
[1:46:17] wrong what did he do he fled
[1:46:20] he fled to the land of nod nod
[1:46:24] means wandering wandering
[1:46:27] the bible said he went out from the
[1:46:29] presence of the lord
[1:46:32] but as a child of god oh my
[1:46:36] in our first birth we were cain's birth
[1:46:40] we were canes
[1:46:41] there was no blood that could take care
[1:46:42] of cain
[1:46:45] but then came the blood of the lord
[1:46:47] jesus
[1:46:48] that blood was able that blood was able
[1:46:52] there was a life inside of that blood
[1:46:53] that could raise up
[1:46:55] the real spiritual ables on the inside
[1:46:58] of our life
[1:46:59] church couldn't do it but he came
[1:47:03] amen lord jesus i want to abide in your
[1:47:07] presence
[1:47:08] lord i want to dwell lord god
[1:47:12] how your life lord conditions us you
[1:47:15] move upon the heart lord
[1:47:17] as you did in our lives from the very
[1:47:18] beginning
[1:47:20] drawing us in repentance you did not
[1:47:23] draw
[1:47:23] drag us up an eye or drag us wherever it
[1:47:26] was
[1:47:27] it was a surrender it was lord god
[1:47:30] and acknowledgement of our sin that we
[1:47:32] we need deliverance we need help
[1:47:35] lord it's been you outside of your
[1:47:38] presence lord god oh my
[1:47:40] we could have known that we lord have
[1:47:42] problems or this or that
[1:47:44] but it's in your presence where things
[1:47:47] can take place
[1:47:49] lord jesus i know lord god
[1:47:53] father what you've done in my life in
[1:47:55] the life lord and many others lord right
[1:47:57] here
[1:47:58] where your presence lord god has come to
[1:48:00] bring such a transformation in our life
[1:48:03] to where we can stand like paul it's no
[1:48:05] longer i that liveth but christ that
[1:48:07] liveth in me
[1:48:08] and lord jesus in that presence lord god
[1:48:12] we stand here this morning like david
[1:48:15] one thing have i desired
[1:48:18] and that will i seek after that i may
[1:48:21] dwell in the house of the lord
[1:48:23] forever as paul would go on to say
[1:48:27] i count myself not to be perfect
[1:48:31] but rather i seek to apprehend
[1:48:35] that which i'm apprehended of oh god
[1:48:38] grant it lord
[1:48:41] father i pray this morning the lord
[1:48:45] if there's one here that doesn't know
[1:48:47] you in that way
[1:48:48] they've never climbed into that place
[1:48:50] it's already provided
[1:48:53] the blood has already been shed
[1:48:57] and the voice of this blood now speaks
[1:49:02] liberty peace deliverance
[1:49:06] overcoming power authority
[1:49:09] sonship it speaks
[1:49:13] god granted this morning i prayed
[1:49:16] lord i ask lord sweeping throughout this
[1:49:18] congregation over every heart and every
[1:49:20] life
[1:49:22] lord i ask lord jesus
[1:49:25] help us the lord in our lives every one
[1:49:27] of us lord
[1:49:29] may we lord god so carefully diligently
[1:49:33] evaluate our lives
[1:49:37] not in our own self lord but under your
[1:49:40] spiritual mri sometimes
[1:49:44] lord things that can enter in or get us
[1:49:47] sidetracked
[1:49:48] from the real purpose in our life
[1:49:52] lord as i read a text
[1:49:56] that lord god a much older minister this
[1:49:59] morning sent out
[1:50:00] on one of the threads that i'm on
[1:50:04] to me with such words of wisdom of what
[1:50:05] was spoken
[1:50:08] he said there's times sometimes that i
[1:50:09] feel like just going on
[1:50:11] i feel like sometimes that mom just so
[1:50:13] tired
[1:50:15] but as he went on to say i realize he
[1:50:19] said that i cannot find that in the
[1:50:21] scripture
[1:50:22] with the lord jesus
[1:50:25] he desired to carry on to fulfill the
[1:50:28] purpose
[1:50:30] that he was called for
[1:50:33] he went on lord to say words like this
[1:50:37] as we are put here for a purpose there's
[1:50:40] a reason
[1:50:43] we can be the biggest battleship that
[1:50:45] would be in the water
[1:50:47] but if we lose purpose we're no more
[1:50:49] than just like a little canoe
[1:50:52] god help us this morning lord maybe
[1:50:55] there's some here this morning the lord
[1:50:58] in their life they might be looking
[1:51:00] what's purpose and they've maybe had
[1:51:02] purpose already before
[1:51:04] but lord they're looking in their life
[1:51:06] lord what purpose do you have for me now
[1:51:09] lord jesus may you just move right up
[1:51:12] next to that heart
[1:51:13] and let them know you're not finished
[1:51:16] with them lord
[1:51:17] may you strengthen them lord may you
[1:51:19] encourage them
[1:51:21] maybe there's one more person that
[1:51:23] they're to witness to lord
[1:51:25] maybe there's something else lord god
[1:51:27] but whatever it might be
[1:51:29] lord we are not going anywhere until
[1:51:32] that purpose is fulfilled
[1:51:35] lord jesus for the young people that are
[1:51:37] here for every one of us
[1:51:39] lord o god may you reach lord to their
[1:51:42] hearts
[1:51:42] lord i pray that lord if there's any
[1:51:45] maybe they've
[1:51:46] lord the things just cares of life not
[1:51:48] not things lord that would be
[1:51:50] sinful that's that's gone from their
[1:51:52] hearts they they don't desire the things
[1:51:54] of the world at all lord you've
[1:51:56] you've completely delivered and done
[1:51:58] such a work in their life
[1:52:00] but lord maybe there's been a misplacing
[1:52:02] of priorities
[1:52:04] god they sense lord as you are speaking
[1:52:06] to their heart
[1:52:07] they realize lord i i want to continue
[1:52:10] to grow i
[1:52:11] i want the fruit to come forth from my
[1:52:13] life i want to reflect him lord jesus
[1:52:18] just as we would have an eclipse upon
[1:52:20] this earth
[1:52:22] and it's when lord something gets or
[1:52:25] upon the moon rather
[1:52:26] it's when the earth the world gets in
[1:52:28] the way of the sun
[1:52:30] and the moon lord help us this morning
[1:52:34] may we be real sensitive and lord really
[1:52:37] just
[1:52:37] invite you and say lord
[1:52:41] i don't want anything lord
[1:52:43] [Music]
[1:52:45] my purpose maybe you find yourself seems
[1:52:48] like the joy of the lord
[1:52:50] just isn't there as it ought to be in
[1:52:52] your life
[1:52:54] it just isn't there you find yourself
[1:52:56] having to make yourself do things
[1:52:58] and there's times when the flesh it does
[1:52:59] get weak but
[1:53:01] why not just evaluate
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:04] is there things that's come in the way
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:07] maybe you come to church
[1:53:11] but there's no meat offering to bring
[1:53:13] there's no drink offering to bring
[1:53:16] it's as though that maybe your life is
[1:53:18] just drying up
[1:53:21] but right now this morning you'd like to
[1:53:24] ask the lord
[1:53:26] restore to me the joy of thy salvation
