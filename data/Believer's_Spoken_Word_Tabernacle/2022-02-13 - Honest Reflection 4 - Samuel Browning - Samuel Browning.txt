him this morning amen amen so good to be in the house of the lord once again be honest with you i this morning i said oh my goodness i looked outside and some some of you maybe many of you didn't say about it so thank you lord i was starting to see grass i wanted to see more snow but i didn't want to see snow necessarily on sunday morning and it just came so quickly and you know sometimes people ask you they say you get much lake effect snow and i guess i really don't understand all that so well this is really lake effect snow right here i know when the boys were traveling home last night from the youth banquet there in findlay they called me his dad the the ice and so forth so they just they got on up the road just a little bit and everything cleared and it's clear on the way home but everything's just so patchy but i'm glad that god allowed us to be here today i'm glad he made a way you know you know brother branham would say it like this and um you know he didn't he doesn't rehear he didn't mention it in a way that we put our lives at risk we understand that everybody has to use wisdom it's just like this kind of weather here you have different ones that travel from the snow belt everywhere else you know and you always have to just use wisdom because there's times that things happen like this that we're not even expecting you know to get but we're not southerners we we know how to drive in the snow i have different brothers talk to me about that but you know brother branham just gives such an encouragement he speaks he says you take he said a family that'll drive through a snowstorm to be in church he said you watch god reward that i don't believe brother branham was saying if somebody said i don't know if i could drive through a snowstorm or not the point being made was is that if you don't let anything stop you a lot of things that could try to stop us a lot of things try to hinder us but he said god will reward that once you think of this here just reading this just yesterday morning it's going through some things and study brother brown was talking about how that even when he was a sinner he wasn't even serving the lord and he speaks very clearly how he pulled in the traps at midnight he said i wouldn't fish wouldn't hunt he said i wanted to honor the sabbath now the brown wasn't even he wasn't serving the lord he made this statement after it he says god honored that and you know it's just little things that you you and i god entrusts to us to do and you know when we'll say god just help me to be sensitive to what the things that i'm to do and just to do what god's asked us to do in his word god honors that we're not looking for something but we just want to we want to please the lord and to think god would take notice and he honored that that the prophet went around and he pulled in all of his traps at midnight he went out and did all of that so there wouldn't be anything caught on the sabbath day or on sunday and i just happen to believe that god honors every sacrifice how many is a witness of that god honors that he honors that amen so let's just here this morning we we want to take the um the special offering for the building project and i know some may not be here and some are streaming you can you can give that next week for some but some of the brothers are we able to do it so let's just we'll go ahead and take that and then we'll also pray as we enter into the word of the lord let's just go to the lord in prayer heavenly father lord i thank you dear god for your mercy and your grace once again i thank you lord for this congregation of people lord the lord just standing right here lord before me thank you father for their love for you lord thank you for what you've done lord and what you're doing in each of our lives we're a privileged people lord thank you for your mercy father [Music] now lord as we lift this offering we lord we ask that you would just bless him lord father even as brother shane gave testimony when he gave that presentation here last week god how that the last time we as a congregation we stood and we prayed and i lord i know the brothers and sisters were praying about the different bids to come in lord i think six or seven bids finally lord the things begin to come in things that were quoted to us god we just lord have asked for your leadership lord as a congregation lord and we ask that god that you'll just bless your children this morning lord i know you will lord it's not hard to ask that that's a promise in your word but we're asking oh god that you'll bless them this morning lord as they would sacrifice lord and give lord father and we just ask that you'll come lord by way of your word speak to our hearts in a personal way lord we need to hear from you lord for questions upon our hearts and things lord sometimes that we have before us that we just can't make sense of lord father in everything of our life we need you lord jesus you are the answer you are all that we have need of o god and i pray lord that even as i stand here and i would preach lord o god under the anointing of the holy spirit and i i just invite you to come lord you're the speaker lord we need to hear from you and i pray that god that your anointing lord will go with these prayer cloths lord that i have upon my body lord o god for the needs lord that they're intended for lord for the request lord that's come lord for your children lord may i pray god that everything be said in order lord i pray that god that opposition lord that would be present lord physically in the body may it be parted lord like the red sea o god may your presence come down oh god as we stand on your word lord we stand with our feet caught firmly planted upon the promised lord now may the waters of jordan part of god and father we walk lord into the promised lord jesus for what lord pertains to our lives and for needs right now we love you and we thank you father jesus precious name amen amen god bless you just give us unto the lord you want to just lead us in the portion of the brain would that be okay amen [Music] to dream [Music] yes [Music] lord oh yes lord jesus thank you father thank you for your mercy o god thank you jesus thank you lord yes [Music] bless your name more [Music] yes lord jesus [Music] let's look into the word of the lord and we'll go right to haggai chapter one and i'm just going to read a few verses of scripture from there we want to just read a few verses of scripture magi chapter 1 verse 1 it says in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month and the first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shatil governor of judah and to joshua the son of josedec the high priest saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying this people say the time has not come the time that the lord's house should be built aren't you grateful for the word of the lord that comes to discern our hearts i'm glad it really comes to discern our hearts in verse 3 then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying is it time for you o ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways you have sown much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you are not filled with drink you clothed but there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and i will take pleasure in it and i will be glorified saith the lord you looked for much and lo it came to little when you brought it home i did blow up on it why saith the lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and you run every man to his own house therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew and the earth is stayed from her fruit and i called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labor of the hands you know to the natural eye and just a carnal understanding it would just seem like why but this is the mercy and the love of almighty god this is god's love this is god's mercy to his children amen may god bless your word as you're being seated i want to continue to speak on this thought that the lord has inspired us here some weeks ago on honest reflections and i we could continue to title every service that way really because that's really what our lives what the word of god is intended for is that we would be able to really take account of our lives and really reflect we've we've not come here really when we gather together like this we we think of it brother branham wouldn't say it over and over he says you know we come and we worship and we sing songs he said but the main purpose that we come here this is the house of correction is it's a place where the word of god is to go forth and we with understanding that there's a there's a burden and there's a desire within our heart to walk pleasing to the lord and we're aware of the promises that apply to us and to this hour you see we're not a people that are just saying we believe that the lord is coming back because you can speak to many different individuals that could be into other uh denomination it could be in denominations and so forth and you'll hear many of them saying oh the things are getting bad and i tell you the lord is coming back soon they believe that let me say it like this there is a way into that preparation just as much as in his first coming there had to be a preparation for that first coming and god sent a message by the way of john the baptist john was the one that was identified in the scripture prepare ye the way of the lord that whole thing prepare you the way of the lord it's like going down a roadway and if there was boulders and everything else in that roadway this is the path the king is coming so if there's things in the way they need to be moved out of the way because he's coming this way and so god came in this hour and god has to overthrow creeds and dogmas and everything that would hinder and the real hindrance is that god coming by his word and bringing such an illumination that those things in our life we can recognize that by the grace of god and that our lives be cleared out because after all it is that pathway that god has come to speak to you see many many in that day they were religious and when john came on the scene many of them came and asked him are you here are you he many of them came religious in that day and they didn't repent at all and gee remember john said why are you coming out here and you know why have you come out and you see the purpose that they came was just to see what's going on they weren't it wasn't something that was yearning or drawing or pulling them of life calling to life and so the real pathway was not going to be through their life but there was a group of people believers lives that were upon the earth in that moment that there were those who were waiting like anna simeone but i also want to remind you that there were others like peter there were others like the woman at the well come on that would not have been people that everybody wanted to associate with let me say this their life what god had reserved that part of the word was a pathway that god was going to come through and so god works by his word to make get that pathway cleared out this is why when the prophet when he would speak the message greatest battle ever fought and he's dealing with getting the battle stopped on the inside first get that war get that victory on the inside then you've got the strength of that victory to fight every other battle that comes your way you've got you've got that which cannot be overcome because the one now inside of you is the one who triumphed over every principality over everything of death hell in the grave so no matter what would come your way you have greater receive that is in you than he that's in the world and this is why john would write whosoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory even our faith and that faith in our life it's not really our faith that faith is the faith of the son of god just hear the prophet this week and he places it so clearly he says that faith that is within you that is the holy ghost so the holy ghost is the faith of god operating through our life i tell you greater is he that is in us that gives me strength that gives me that really gives me courage so the pathway and i bring it back to this place here here you and i are and we see the promise you know first corinthians 15 first thessalonians 4 but god reserved until this time to open that the pathway that preparation into the rapture condition he promised he would send malachi 4 the prophet in this hour and i want you to perk up here if you're wondering and you say why is it that god would have to send a prophet it's when men lose sight of the living god and though they can carry the word they get away from the word of the lord they get away from the reality of the living god let me just say something to you and i we know this when we get in the presence of almighty god it brings conviction it causes us to search our lives because the word alone you know there's things we can read in the scripture and it can speak to our lives but think about it in his presence and as we walk in his presence daily then when you open the bible then when you're listening to the message you're not a stranger you are in fellowship with him and you're fellowshipping even as you're listening to the message as you're reading in the scriptures as you're in prayer as you're meditating you're walking with him and fellowshipping with him and there is reflection that comes into our life to bring conviction there's things that we can it can come into our lives and we're asking god to forgive us and we're not sitting in a church service are you hearing me but you see all of these things work together all of them work together according to god's great plan and program so the way back for preparation it would be just like you know i don't know if you've ever uh watched how they do the preparation for the uh the astronauts and things like that but uh you know when i was young real little i didn't like the rides at cedar point i i hated heights i still really don't like heights you know but i'll do it because there's fuzzy things with antlers that come by that's pretty good but i don't like heights but i really didn't like those rides so one day you know here we are there at cedar point i'm getting somewhere we get into this we go into this imax theater that's there and they're playing this space you know how they train astronauts now if you've never been in one of the imax theaters it's one of those things like wraps around just like that and i i'm standing here i thought they got me on a ride there was things going on inside of that with that space training and you're jumping back oh you know my seat was rocking and because the training that they have to go through and there is such rigor that they have to do and there's a narrowing down the training they're going through there's a narrowing down in that training when initially starts with applicants and people that are coming there's a narrowing down it might start ever so big but it narrows down when jesus was here there was a multitude following him but after just one service 70 walked away and they said this is too hard they couldn't understand it but you know what the elect didn't understand it but they believed it they knew who they were in the presence of and that was enough you see it wasn't you our understanding our belief is not something that you can't explain as a believer you're a believer not because you understand it or can explain it you're a believer because you believe and god ordains you to believe and there's something that you could believe in this you know wherever that god would begin to deal with your life but there was a longing because you were ordained to be a part of the body of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ it's not taking away from all of those that are out there but there was a special calling upon your life that you could not be satisfied with just the things of just being around a church that's why even coming to this church there must be a longing in your life that it's got to be more than just being associated with the message or i know that god sent a prophet it's got to be something that's in your heart that there's a uniting there's a drawing there's a calling you say brother samuel how do i know that she examine your own life there's a desire that i am longing for reality there's a lot of things out there to be offered that could uh seemingly try to satisfy or appease the natural man but this way in this hour we're not just looking at uh you know all the rapture is coming upon us we right here in this hour god has kept a promise that he made in this hour he's jehovah jiren the same lamb of god that walked here on the shores of galilee that was ascended on high sent back the holy ghost in its fullness he promised i will restore i will restore what that early church had there at pentecost i will restore it wherein the fullness that i walk inside of my body he promised that and the same lamb that was there is the same lamb that's here right with us we're not here on a part of a lamb only on a portion of a lamb john said i turned to sea i turned to see him i turned to see the one that spake with me when he's hearing a voice as a trumpet there in revelations 5 john weep not for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals thereof no wonder the prophet could say in this manner it is one of the most sublime acts why he's already paid for this book he's already paid the price the title deed it's already been settled of eternal life are you with me now he's coming now to take that book because there is a need for a change upon this earth every facet of this is promised to come in to the final stages of redemption for this earth for there shall be a millennium there shall be a future home and god has prepared the way for himself and you are part of that way what grace is given to us in this hour we're not just looking where many of the christendom is looking for oh i'm looking for him to come in the sky we realized well we're there they're looking for that but remember his coming right now this right now is the coming of the lord where he's coming in the fullness of his spirit is that right revelations 10 1 the mighty angel descended that is the holy ghost himself the angel of the lord he's come in his fullness what is it he's coming to his temple hallelujah secret coming that not others know about but it's a secret coming and he's coming to his temple to take his abode what is his temple his temple is his word you are a part of his word he's coming to raise up his word in our lives well glory be to god it's his working and we are a part of that working hallelujah this isn't even nowhere near where i'm going but it's right on where he wants to go privilege and desire we're not we're not we recognize that preparation has come to us right now right now is this time of preparation the confidence that god brings by his word calling us under the blood not calling us to a church calling us under the blood calling us to a real token life that's the mercy and love of almighty god now let me try to approach here the subject here this morning i i guess we could say that now as it just moves in upon me these people these believers that we're reading about they were not people who had started on their own without a vision they cannot come back sister surely god bless you good to see you we have not they had not come back into the land of the you know i think that's a good idea they weren't back there by that this was prophecy there were events taking place prophecy was there being interpreted in these events daniel had said as we read last week to refer back to that it would be troubleless times but you know it's just like this with our walk as a believer we realize i remember realizing you know as a young boy you hear about the persecution you're about tests we hear about trials but that's not the focus of serving god i mean it's just like somebody's saying oh you don't want to get married man i tell you marriage you know there's all kinds of trials you know this or that or you need to talk to somebody else sure does test and try but that's not the theme of it i think of what ruth bell graham what she wrote like this she said i wrote a diary regarding my sons and she called it the prodigals ruth bell grand brother billy graham's wife she said i wrote it down and i'm glad i did she said because when i began to go back and read concerning things i didn't remember it except i had wrote it down you see that's if that happens there in the natural how much more within our lives we're not focused upon oh persecution's going to come because if that's your focus you'll never go anywhere you'll stay away you won't give any confession to nobody but it begins with a confession that god has touched my life god has changed my life i'm a different person now don't let the devil silence that voice hallelujah you find that how this is not even the focus when they came back to the land that wasn't even the focus the focus was we've been inspired and directed by god to come back into the land and to build the temple of almighty god we've been commissioned by god what god spoke regarding in isaiah what he spoke in jeremiah we are part of that prophecy but this part that we read right here is the same people and as i told you here before or have said it just as going through this and just trying to just just take it in there's not a person that's here and i don't care where you're at in your walk with the lord i don't care how many years you've been serving the lord everyone comes through times of weariness and discouragement every one of us come through moments of things that we're trying to make sense of what's going on around us but we try to and yet sometimes the way we try to make sense of it is we try to do it by our own reasoning and any time you could we can just take this to the bank and cash it anytime we try to walk by our own reasoning we fail right there there's a lot of thoughts that can come into our mind let me just tell you something everything that crosses your mind is not godly oh blessed i don't have no wicked no no i'm saying everything that crosses your mind is not godly even the things that you've entertained so and so might think this about me so-and-so might be this well i wonder if everything that comes through your mind is not godly let me say it like this let's say even if it is so we want to say i'll take the other approach are you hearing me because if not it affects our life our walk with god now i want to just deal with this here just a little bit can you turn with me in the bible to hebrews chapter 12. and i want to just deal with here just a little bit this morning if the lord would help us and just give us just a few moments and i want to just be able to deal with the part and looking at the chastening of the lord and i want to look at that because we hear that word and as bible readers and and believers we hear that word and we want to just we want to look into this here just a moment so if we can read from verse 5 here here paul is writing this admonition he says have you forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him and what god see when god begins to deal with the life each of our lives he begin to speak and there begin the chastening of the lord correcting things in our life things that we were giving ourselves to it could sit in a meeting and he's and he's dealing with dress he's dealing with how that sisters are to dress how brothers ought to dress how husbands ought to treat their wives wives and so forth and he's dealing with just everything and getting down to sin he has to he deals with things that gets down to you see what god comes down to deal with is things that know a person can say i'm a pretty good fellow i'm a pretty good guy i love the lord but the word of god comes down to expose and say but these works that are coming out don't testify with what you're saying and he doesn't come in that way to condemn us he comes to rebuke to bring chastening to do what so we know where we're wrong if you're working on a factory and you you have to make this part for let's say four trucks well if you're doing it wrong something needs to be calibrated on that machine or on the pumps brother keener something has to be calibrated if you see something coming down the line and say hey wait a minute here something's off well what's off i mean we're churning out the parts no something's off something needs to be retooled or recalibrated something needs to be looked at not just keep on passing it down and that's how the holy spirit comes and he deals with our life all along he's looking in our life because there's things sometimes that can get out of sync there's things when the preaching of the word goes forth it brings to our realization wait a minute here there's things that's just not lining up with the word of god now this is where verse 5 says faint not faintly oh there's no use even trying hey hey hey we're not we're not we're not we're not dealing with somebody who's flesh and blood i'm talking about one right now who loves us who cares about us and who has the strength that's needed to bring into our lives and bring that correction what needs to take place in our life don't faint when don't run away don't well i'm just going to stay away from church or i'm going to do this and don't faint when thou art rebuked for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth now this is what he does to whom he loves now let me just say it like this god's not sitting around who can i chastise no god this isn't how he works but his love for us is for his word that he will not allow us to get off course without correcting us and and he sees that there are things that need to arise in our life or come at us and he permits he permits keep that thought in line he permits satan to come he permits satan to come with these things and all some of those things are necessary for the molding in our life brother brown would say it in this manner and i'm trying to just i want to just lay this in very clearly this morning he says the trials come to take the slowness out of us i mean friends let's just be honest we're still walking in these flesh bodies and god's provide here at tester trial he permits satan to bring our way to do what get slowness out of us because we can get a little slow in the things we become commonplace in the things of the lord and god will allow a tester trial to take the slowness out of our life he's not working against us he's for us but the correction that the correction that will come in our life it's just like things that you can see among your children that sometimes there's things they have to go through things they have to face there's adversities they must face it's part of the molding of character as well as the time that we sat down with them and we speak about certain things things of that pertaining to the season of life they're in now what you're doing now decisions now will affect here later there's things all of that must be taken care of in the season but there's things like i could tell you that you know one of one of my one of our boys there had went into a job and one of the jobs where he was at oh you know coming home and pouring the heart out and what was going on there i'll be honest with you let's just let's just take the jacket off and be honest my dander got a little riled in a christian way come on now don't you know don't sit in that pious and everything else i know you all but as i sat right there i had to bite my tongue because i felt like going down and saying who do i need to talk to but to recognize and i pray god help me because you know why this is not gonna be the last time that he's gotta face this right i don't care where you're working at i don't care what you're dealing with you're still gonna deal with people that's why people think going from this child to this y'all whoo glory i'm in green pastures now no there's rotten people there just like there were rotten people there and many times the problem oh boy we're going to preach now the problem ain't the people the problem is you whoo come on friends we'd have to look in an honest reflection if we keep having the same problems it's not the problems out there god's trying to say there's some things that need to be worked out of your life oh god say my co-worker's here god changed my boss over here god do this over here god do this over here god do this over here god said i put you there to mold you and shape you like brother banham asked god i think it's in the mess in the adoption series he was praying asking god lord i just want to go on and the holy spirit spoke back to him and said are you trying to dodge your trials see to me that clarity that transparency in the prophet's life i can identify with that because every one of us could be there every one of us can say you know what i just want to go ahead and go on home who wouldn't want to go and be with the lord but i don't want to walk around here with you know where i have to pick up my lips to step up stairs and everything else god never made us to be that way oh my i feel like i've just got a whole arcade in front of me now how am i going where do i go lord the bible says happy is the people who's god is the lord hallelujah or many other scriptures that we can go into there's a place to draw real happiness from a place to draw real strength from but i want you to notice this chastening notice in verse 7 if you endure chastening notice endure it endure it god deal with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not i think of the one son that came back and told me he said you know what i'm glad i'm glad that i stuck that out i'm glad i'm glad i stuck it out i was really glad too are you hearing me this morning this is right down with what goes in the lunchbox there's things sometimes that you you and i our flesh hear me now you think in our flesh think of this when god stood in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and he's looking there in that sumerian age the age of bitterness age or organization was taking precedence and here god stands with two words in the midst of all their tribulations and he says i know i know i know what you're going through i know yes sir brethren now he said for the the untutored untrained believer they would think that it just ought to be as soon as something's taking place that god just steps right in and skims the tide you see every time we're looking for the same the same experience as the red sea are you hearing me now instead of looking for the same god look for the same god he's always the same his characteristics his nature has never changed when they went through the land and taking every city in the land every city the way they took it was it different different it wasn't all of a sudden a pattern like hey what's done here at jericho going to be done in a.i be done at the next city it wasn't the same way but it was the same god same god things coming you and i different things that we see but it's the same god he said i am the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah if you endure chastening if you endure it god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement where of all are partakers then are you bastards and not sons so correction can come even tests and trials can come sometimes the tests and trials will come and you know what the test and trial remember it's only to prove or show what's really there sometimes in our lives and i'm saying in our lives we can feel like i'm so weak but you're standing you're standing and it's not you that's standing it's god who's standing in your life what should i do stand with him who's standing for you hallelujah we're in that time of trouble right now hallelujah think of it where we are in moments and times uh just like this where you know people oh you know ah i'm not going back there i don't want to hear this or i don't want to hear that or what and it just walks on away it gets it gets too tight it gets too close but what we're talking about is your soul god's desire our desire is not to feel comfortable here in this life or in a condition that would be unpleasing or unsatisfactory to almighty god we want to walk pleasing to him hallelujah to walk to to serve him but think about it they who are without it and yet they're not really without the chastisement as far as like hearing it but it's whether they receive it or not see we can hear the correction of the word but are we receiving the correction of the word when we hear the holy spirit cry out and say you can't keep living that kind of life do we hear it and say yeah lord that's true or do we say god come and change my life lord [Music] we don't want to be hearers of the word and deceive ourselves like that's true god knows exactly where i'm at he does and even with things that would be taking place within our life we don't want to just come and acknowledge it amen lord i want to hear what you have to say and he says what he has to say concerning it and then you come back to him again lord i want to hear what you have to say he says the same thing lord i want to hear what you have to say no really to be honest you say lord i don't like what you're saying so i'm going to keep pushing the butt until i get a different response i'm going to tell you what balaam did balaam kept pushing the button till eventually god gave him the desire of his heart what balaam needed to do instead of pushing the bat and looking for a different response he needed to ask god to change his desires right away when the word said this is not the way that should have been enough hey balaam was a prophet not a true one come on now inspiration came down upon balaam's life is that right but down on the inside was not a heart that was surrendered to god balaam could surrender his tongue to god he could prophesy under inspiration and it was not balaam's intelligence it was god who would speak through balaam even regarding a star shall arise out of jacob but do you realize even that moment of surrender where that came through is not enough to stand for balaam [Music] are you hearing me because his heart was not inclined with the things of god oh my god's not obligated to come where god you come and you bless me in the way that i'm going no god said my way and i know you might think different about my ways but my ways are higher than your ways is that right notice verse 9 furthermore we had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence is that right what was the reverence we heeded to what they were asking there's a lot that goes with this right here in verse nine just as i'm reading just things just continue to open within this because all of this here here to give reverence it's even that who deals with relationship we could go on to this but i just want to stay focused here this morning is that okay shall we not know and shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live there's things let's be honest that our mother and father corrected us on at that time at that time we thought this is over the top maybe i need to get some of the young people to give me some phrases you know like hashtag over the top and i don't see what's wrong with that i think you've been too picky right here so-and-so does this so-and-so does that right but the difference was here's the thing now now now listen friends i'm not talking about harshness or severity i'm what i'm talking about is is the correction when it came not only has it strayed into straighten things out and i'm not just talking about with things down the line like oh thank god that you know my dad gave me a weapon i wasn't in that bank robbery i know there's been those that have they've got that kind of a testimony they weren't out with certain boys at night my daddy was one of them he told his daddy i'm going out with those boys and my papal said no you're not 17 years old don't make a difference you're not going oh god give us more fathers like that i'm not talking about maybe exactly the way that my papal did it but let me say this to you right now they're under our roof the token is applied and we as for me in my house we're gonna serve the lord are you hearing are you hearing me we're not going to apply the token to the kitchen and you know to master bedroom and and on you know to the living room but you know we're not going to apply the token you know to your bedroom the token was to be upon the house true preached brother samuel and he's already taken this all along so we're just going to run with it there's things that he speaks to us now let's bring it down to a spiritual there's things that he speaks to you and i that sometimes there's things where god brings correction to our life we don't understand it we don't understand maybe why there be certain dissolving of certain relationships or why this has taken place or why that is taking place you understand i'm talking about relations with the things of the world and you'll find that there's things sometimes that we just can't understand let me tell you something i bet you abraham couldn't understand why is it this contention going on why can't we all just get along and why can't we all just hold hands around the fire and get along but god was there and he was going to bring a separation he was forcing abraham's hand to it because abraham was still packing around lot why human compassion that has got many in trouble human compassion that don't know how to separate human compassion from the love of god the love of god will have you do things even when it comes in discipline that your human compassion could say this is not how i want to do it are you hearing me now but the love of god will work in that strain because it is on a higher order it's like your children you can explain to them that the stove is hot but you don't sit down and have a science lesson with them now sit down i'm going to i'm going to sit down and explain this to us because most of us in here probably don't even know that now it's enough that you know now hot i ain't going near it and if you went near it and it's hot and you got too close you're going to be hot whether it's by the fire or the belt or the paddle or the are you with me this morning god brings correction and he wants he listen this isn't our things that comes around that god just wants us to look at and say man i don't know why in the world i don't know what i don't know this i god god desires because there's some times where we just don't understand you know brother brahm tells us like this with the chastening of the lord he says sometimes he said god will permit you to be put in a wheelchair god will be permit a sickness god will permit things just to see what kind of attitude you're going to take in it see god the molding of our character it works even to where our attitude about certain things is that right i mean sometimes when we go through things we'd like to say you know other well i guess others today's super bowl party we said i'm having a pity party just bring over the bones from the wings you know we're having a pity party come on friends i'm not saying that to put anybody down but you you know what i'm talking about shall we not be in subjection unto the father spirits and live just just submit and say lord that's what you're that's what you're saying that's what you're doing right now this is lord whatever's being done help me to receive what's going on right now if it's through a test if it's a trial correction that's coming to my life with things help me to receive what's taking place right now what you're going to what you're doing right now what's coming about to mold me for that next step for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure meaning desires and things that they've seen in our lives right you know it's just like when you see brother braham tells us he said you see a boy and he gets his own way right now he said i'd advise that young man to never get married until he meets god because he said the woman that he's married mary he'll make hell on earth for her come on now these are things what's he talking about character is to be able to look at these things i know sometimes these can be kind of touchy and and this and that but that's okay we won't be touchy sometimes we're looking at different things and it's important that within this that they did it for our own pleasure not about you got on my nerves that's not how god does it god brings discipline to our lives now hear me now on this god brings discipline because there is a purpose that he has called us to and is calling us to there's a job to be done and just like you brother said you know well plumbing school and some are you in and right now i mean they don't just let things slide right by and say oh you know what drake brian you guys man you guys you know if there's things they can see right now even things they've been through other plumbers will say hey let me just give you benefit from my mistakes when you see this go this way don't try this right here no you feel like you can do it but don't get yourself tangled up with this why there are things that they are speaking to us in that hour that's not a correction like a belt coming that's there trying to help us in the midst of that situation and that's even as the word comes across our pathway every service is not a correction like this are you hearing me oh my brother samuel's got the spiritual belt out no every service is not like that there might be correction that has to come in that channel that's true but there's other things in our life that he has to speak to us and we can say oh i need to correct this sometimes there's things that we have in our disposal like god has been preaching to us on prayer or speaking to us teaching to us it's already in our disposal but he's letting us know the great power within this tool this weapon they've done it for their own pleasure in other words things that they could see as a father could say i can't let the sun do like this because i tell you what if my son if he starts well he knows more than the teachers or my daughter knows more than the teachers and you back that up guess what eventually it'll go keep on going up the ladder and remember who's above all god we are living in a society right now come on now brother branham told us he said we talk about juvenile delinquency he said it's actually parental delinquency then he brought it on down he said it's actually pulpit delinquency you see correction is to begin at the house of god you know what it says that all of our lives our homes should be ordered by the word of the lord that's what it's to be under we need his guidance and his direction for our lives this is why god had back in the old testament they had the shackle of the sanctuary and that shekel was what determined the weight of everything else the shackle was not determined outside of the sanctuary the shackle is what was determined it was sat inside the sanctuary i say that shekel presented to you and i in this hour it was a shackle that had been shaved down and cut out it didn't hold the same power and the same way but god has raised up a true shackle of himself of his own person that it comes down to every life that you and i can walk with the token the baptism of the holy ghost the shackle of the sanctuary that when things are presented we can weigh it and say nope this seems pretty good but no no ain't working out this is a balance in case some of you didn't know i know oh that's nothing all i have is a smartphone but you understand the balance they put that shackle there and the shackle had a weight did it match the weight of rice or whatever it is they were weighing it was valued by the weight it's not by how it looked i could take two different balls up here and i could take them balls and i could have one here that's no more than one of them kmart or target balls or whatever you know the kinds in the racks that are we used to sneak around them if it was painted up like a bowling ball and then i had a real bowling ball here and then i looked at brother david i said you ready and then here it was i threw the ball that wasn't really a bowling ball but it looked like it he would brace differently and then when he this ain't the bowling ball but it looked like it you see god is not interested in just how things that it looks like it his image is what comes from the inside out in our life he works to bring forth that image that's why when when when when when they're taking the gold and the beater would beat the gold beat the goal beat the goal beat the goal beat the goal and he's doing it until he can finally see his reflection in it and then he knows it's pure that's why god comes and he works and he works and he works and he works and he works in our life until eventually it has the reflection of jesus christ let me just try to bring this down because it's just normal let me just try i want to wrap just this this portion up right here brother branham you hear brother branham on tape and i want you just to can i have just a few moments here i want to just deal with this part as we've been looking with the chastening part brother brandon will make a statement brother brown will say god chastened job and it's absolutely correct then brother brown will come back around and he'll say this is out of the evening messenger do you remember when job had all his trials he said that wasn't god chastening job but it was god approving his servant you said the same that's a contradiction no it's not chastening and here's what i want you to really focus in chastening has many folds to it as far as correcting if we're looking at correction under chastening god was not correcting job but he was chastening him god had allowed permitted permitted satan to come at him is that right he permitted it but it was not god correcting him it was god approving him or allowing to come out of his life what was job's testimony i know when all this is said and done my life shall come forth as pure as gold job do you understand everything that's going on no i don't but i know he's not the author of confusion joe what do you know i'm going to stand on what i know and that is my sacrifice is what he gave me and i presented that sacrifice according to his word and i'm standing on it by the authority of the revelation that's been given to me and that's where i'm going to stand do you understand everything else that's going on i don't understand it but i know him in whom i have believed god is silent brother bram said sometimes god is silent to see what kind of attitude we'll take we've all been there right maybe there's this morning certain things we're praying about and it seems like i don't see no answer i don't see no answer let me tell you something don't go looking for other answers in other places are you hearing me now let me tell you something i've had situations where you know even in the testimony and when i went into teaching that god spoke through somebody else that i don't even know as a believer but i didn't go to that man are you hearing me i didn't go to him and say hey what do you think ought to be i was looking to the lord and when you're looking to the lord and you stay in contact with god god can speak to you through different avenues but you'll recognize it as god are you hearing me you know you know exactly what i'm talking about you recognize hey this is god that's speaking how does that happen brother samuel do you have to be in contact with the voice of god and the voice of god is not a man the voice of god is the holy ghost he said he will lead and guide us when israel was coming into the promised land everybody who gave them bread and water or would help them along the way was not believers but they received it amen is that right jesus walking close to the lord walking in close fellowship with him this was not chastening or correcting but chastening of the lord has many folds there's tests there's trials there's persecution and there's correction right all four things and tests and trials things that come now look sickness can come as a test or trial right see what we're going to do about it but then also sickness can be come as a correction to our life is that right see this is where the three buddies of job they didn't understand the chastening of the lord the only thing they saw about chastening is you messed up who you really messed up man bad news bad news george they didn't understand that other part they didn't understand that there is a molding of character that through tests and trials and even in correction when we can receive what's taking place there is a greater reality that will move in our lives and we can see the love of god the reality of god and who we are even more clearly you see we've been called by god by the living god our purpose is not something just contrived in time no no no paul wrote to titus our purpose the calling was given before the foundation of the world and this is why that purpose that purpose is greater than any earthly purpose and i want you to hear me this purpose that god has called us for everything else comes out of there to see that this purpose is achieved not that other things come before it whether it's your job your occupation your family and god god did not give you your family for your family to become a hindrance god gave you your children to be a blessing and that you would raise them in the admonition of the lord be an example to guide and direct them correct them when they need to be corrected this is why friends when things are out of line in our lives and priorities become address adjusted we're talking about priorities now and the real focus and purpose becomes all together different than the chastening of the lord correction comes to our life what we read in our text where god told them to consider their ways this was the mercy and the love of almighty god these people were not lazy are you hearing me they didn't shut down and say we're going to wait for checks i'm gonna preach now because that's a spirit even that's out here in this age where nobody wants to work and not that any when you go to work and say hey man but we're thankful to have a job think we'll have bread on the table is that right we're thankful because we know god's provided that but that's not my focus they weren't they didn't shut down what happened is their strength and their zeal turned completely to the natural things of life that's the way it was in the garden of eden when the fall came they went to make something for themselves to try to stand in god's presence stand in the face of what was coming at them let me say this the natural things of life we can all testify to this it will only leave us empty it'll never meet the challenge of the hour you can't face the things and say man the heat's coming on it's not the time to get away from god it's not the time to let down on the things of god brother samuel satan seems like he's waylay in my family now's not the time to compromise now's the time more than ever to stand stand therefore and have your loins curd about with truth who's not compromising on it now is not that time amen priorities become adjusted because listen not one of us enjoy hardship you can lay me whether it's financial whether anything being misunderstood disagreements whatever none of us like that i'm gonna preach while it's coming well brother samuel that ain't bothering me you're not telling the truth because when it's down there inside of your crawl down inside of here you can say well that ain't bothering me but it comes out towards other people comes out towards other people come on friends that's why it has to be a work the holy spirit we gotta listen i'm not interested because god knows my weakness he knows your weakness the bible says all things are naked before him with whom we have to do so it's just like when god comes down and deals with our life he's not coming down to shame us but if we can stand up and stand up and say that's true lord and god will say that's my boy that's my girl standing right with the word of god and gotta go right to work in that in our life he didn't come down to condemn us but will we line up with that word and then it affects everything else around us sometimes we're carrying too much in here too much in here we start carrying around and then what happens starts trying to fulfill it with other things this wasn't what was coming on here what we just read in our text was not persecution oh we're being persecuted they were they were 15 years ago they were persecuted and that's why the enemy kept on coming at him pounding at him day by day you think when the enemy came to him you think that they just oh the enemy didn't show up today but some things that the enemy the adversary showed up when they hired counselors did you hear what the bible says hired counselors what's a counselor it's a wordy guy and satan's very wordy i'm not talking about somebody can just take up your time i'm talking about he's worthy he likes to use a word but he likes to spin it in his way well we're getting on him now boy somebody might as well say amen sick and bull we got him treed he likes to do that why because if he can get you into paying attention to that and heeding to that you find yourself just shut down that's a trap of the enemy he's not interested in saying well you know what well you got to go back to the world for me to be satisfied but if you just shut down he's like i got him they're not living victorious that's all i wanted but you were made to live victorious let me just say made for it you're built for the victory of god to be displayed in your life say brother samuel you don't know what test or what trials or what adversity i'm facing but let me tell you something nothing is greater than the one who descended down to the lowest parts of hell and took away the sin question out of your life and raised up on that easter morning and ascended above every triumph over every principalities and ascended on high brother not only did he defeat the unseen realm he conquered even the laws that said a man can't ascend he showed i'm god over my own laws [Applause] that's the kind of stuff you're made out of that's the kind of stuff that this god is they weren't being persecuted they were being chastened let me just close with this and we'll pick up lord willing i'd say this lord we must discern by the word of god this is why when we come to the house of god we we need to come to the house of god let me say this you need to be in the message of the hour well brother samuel i went and got a devotional from a bookstore you need to be in the message of the hour if you're more of a devotional than being in the message of the hour and getting into that you need to lay that aside you need to get into the message of the hour brother samuel i i don't understand it you cast down that evil one who's telling you that you know that it was god who sent this message this message is the revelation of jesus christ it's this message right here being ministered that's his presence that you sense i'm not knocking anything with devotions but sometimes people are going clear out here all these other books and i'm studying this and studying that get into the message of the hour zealous for these things friends that give strength in our life you brothers know that you put it on when you're working you put it on as you're going throughout the day and you know god gives to you what you have need of there's things that god spoke to you even this past week that you're still feeding on little nuggets you know what that is ruth that's handfuls of mill that have been purposely dropped for you what should i do stay in this field don't go to the field of another don't go in another field glean from this field because in this field right here the lord of harvest has descended in this promise you say who's the lord of harvest boaz is and there was a chief reaper who was over the rest that caught his descent the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout a voice and a trump of an archangel the chief reaper being the messenger of this hour caught that the lord of the harvest is on the scene this is what you're to pray for stay in this field glean from the word of the lord but some you saying other people don't have truth this word in this hour is an assembling of truth that have been scattered i don't have to assemble it it's already been assembled [Applause] i know where the asparagus is at i know where the cabbage is at i know where the spices is at it's all been stored up for right now oh there's a famine in the land there is for the hearing of the word of god but there's no famine among the bride of jesus christ amen there is strength there is food that's able to give you strength to fly above the things of the world the things that you battle with there is strength in this word i tell you friends what kind of people we would be if we really avail ourselves morning satan battles that but take back like god told us on thursday redeemed the time bring it back to yourself it's your time there's a brother here right now he had a property over there in south lorraine and there was a guy who wanted to build a garage you know there's got to stay within i don't know what it is now from a property line i don't know what it is brother joy but some you got to stay within a certain you know amount well this individual you know he wanted to put a garage right up on the property line or actually over the property line and the brother's like hey no no no no no no you can't do that you gotta abide by the law it says however many feet from that but you see what happens is if he wouldn't have stayed with that and checked on it eventually that man might have said you know what he's given up let's just build the garage on here and we can be honest there's things that can be built in our life and that's why the spirit of god would say give no place to the devil and sometimes when the spirit of god reveals things we say time for dynamite time for strongholds to come down time for strongholds to come down there's dynamite the dynamics of god to bring down strongholds this is why we need the discernment by the word of god and listen it's not just coming to church but it's recognizing that when we come to church and the word is being ministered and god deals with our heart to act upon that word act upon that word and as then you go out these doors you're walking in fellowship with him when you put on a tape you're going to read the scripture you're meditating on him hey this is between you and him this is between you and him this isn't between you him and brother samuel no no i don't cook it i just serve it right even though a lot of times the waiter of the waitress boy they're the ones that gets it because the cook why you sending this take out here like hey can you step out here a minute but he knows what we need and i say it like this i am closing i am this is why we need to be discerned by the word of god or we can become like these individuals that had gotten so far out of the will of god but here's what they thought they thought we just need to be more fervent man we're i mean i'm working more but the money ain't going this far i just got to put more into you know what we got to do more we got to do more we got to do more that was in them but because that they had succumbed to the pressure of the enemy by getting away from the strength their source of strength it had so changed their thought process to this ain't the time to build it instead we need to focus on our homes we need to focus on our lives see how it was a trap it was a trap how the enemy had so slightly diverted it if not for the grace of god these people would have continued in the same pattern but god's grace the word of the lord came to haggai and discerned what was going on but had them to reflect into their own lives you see if we were to ask them they said man i'll tell you what it's just true it's just well the enemy's just really no the enemy wasn't doing that you see sometimes the devil gets blamed for things that he ain't even doing well now god permits but satan what god was coming around here is there had to be correction because they had become occupied with things gifts instead of the giver things of life instead of him i want you to think of this as we close in matthew chapter 6 where the bible says in matthew chapter 6 it says take no thought you know the scripture what will i eat what will i drink sometimes those are things you you've got to consider right it's true you know i remember when my wife and i were first married i remember going through the checkout line and you get up there and gotta put this back put this back put that back and put this back i remember that there are those times but sometimes when we're looking at this right here jesus knowing i want you to think of this friends he's letting us know the gentiles seek after all this and notice he says gentiles oh israel doesn't seek after all that but remember israel had all they had the covenants the promise of adoption all those other things right but let me say this abraham was a gentile well samuel it says abraham the hebrew brother bram said he was a gentile he came out of a gentile nation chaldeas right well how could it be called hebrew because hebrew means one from beyond he received a call from another world from the living god and that's why he became a hebrew a real hebrew it's not a hebrew in flesh it's a hebrew in spirit and with being a hebrew and spirit we have promises we have great exceeding precious promises that our lives to be occupied with those promises and not with the things things of this worth because as jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of god and all of his righteousness let that be first and then all these other say it again things all these great things all this oh brother samuel this is so thin oh brother samuel this thing the kingdom of god is that which deserves the priority and the recognition in our life everything else falls under the category of things what is that thing thing almost like the dr seuss book thing one and thing two things i say god help us imagine let's just stop it takes me sometimes a longer time to come down here but let's allow the spirit of god listen friends let's let's just not move from this service here this morning and just let it be but let's just just be a service that oh my the presence of god but let it be examined in our life examination even right now examine as even we leave from this place and to ask and say are my priorities what they were a month ago are my priorities what they were a year ago you see god keeps bringing us back to this we're looking at a mirror not a picture god's dealing with us right now not on what we were a month ago he's speaking to us for what we are right now he's dealing with present situations you see he is i'm he that which is which was and which is to come he's the god who's able to point back and say this is what you were but somewhere between here and where you are now oh it's got in the way and he deals can deal with that in each of our lives we want him to deal with in our lives friends you can see right here with these believers that we read about here and reading and god's been having us look at this if not for the mercies of god these people would have worked themselves to death are you hearing me they weren't they weren't lazy they weren't slaughterful they were workers but satan through false accusations through weariness of persecution had caused them to divert their strength to the natural things of life and the natural things of life can never satisfy the spiritual man on the inside there's only one that can do that and that's our heavenly father he's mindful of our needs i say the greatest thing we could do is say god just examining my life and even as you should terry and i walk out of this building this morning i want to look in the word and look if the word cuts say amen to the word god i've not i've not started this in vain because i didn't start this work in my life he who began the good work in me shall perform it to the day of jesus christ and i'm going to let him do it i'm going to say amen to the word i'm going to stand on the word even when it cuts and it stings and i don't understand it but i'm going to stand on the word of god because when we stand there that day the toils of this life road will seem nothing when i get to the end of the way brother bill can sing it he can really sing it we should have him sing it right now the toils of this life will seem nothing when i get to the end of the way i say god let us just take it in right now let's just say lord thank you for your chastening thank you for correction thank you for the tests and trials thank you for like you did for these believers lord they didn't know what was going on around their life they they were probably calling it persecution i'll tell you there's just tests and trials that's coming my way no god was trying to correct them because they had got their priorities out of line and it was the love and mercy of god it wasn't god's god doesn't despise us god does not hate us you cannot change god's love for you you can't change his thought concerning you as a matter of fact he's never had a new thought our thoughts about ourselves have changed a lot right but let's let his thought affect our thoughts my thoughts are higher amen let's pray maybe you're sitting next to husband and wife or maybe a brother in front of you or beside you maybe just reach over a husband and wife maybe hand to hand and maybe brother to brother sister to sister and let's just let's pray it's really set in our hearts a real a real consecration a real determination right now that lord from this in this service of what you've spoke to our hearts in all these services we want to be honest in the reflection of what we're seeing in the mirror and lord we want to be what you've ordained for us to be we don't want that purpose to be clouded up and where we've allowed other things that are a part sometimes of the purpose and we've started to allow them to come ahead of you god i pray this morning lord jesus lord for each and every one of us and myself included lord father lord you know as i've looked over this lord for weeks and weeks when setting right back there lord one morning praying in the pew and you spoke this thought to my heart and as i've examined lord these things and just looking and certainly not seeing all of this here in it but i thank you for your mercy when i look at these believers here in haggai one there was a work that was started in their life and they became discouraged they began to let down well they didn't go back to babylon they didn't become as it were we could say sinful but unbelief had entered in and that's what you discerned in their life because they were it was unbelief in the word of god now the time has not now come but you discerned that lord and you you helped him you broke lord by the discernment of the word and they received that now lord i know there's lives right here this morning no doubt lord would stream this service that there's been a start in their life but they've not went all the way that's one part of this may they lord i pray this morning lord just recognize the lord how satan's desire has been to derail them there's been temptation that's come their life that's come their way and maybe they've heeded some to that temptation but may they not allow that failure lord to define them lord but may the lord god rise up lord jesus under the strength and the vision of the word of god and say lord you started this work in my life you're the same god who'll finish it lord and i give myself to you lord i rise back up in the name of the lord jesus christ i'm going on lord if we've not received the holy ghost may that be the press within their life that rises up in their soul to press on press on little lily press on to eternal life god i pray this morning lord throughout this building lord lives the lord that can look back maybe certain things priorities have gotten rearranged in their life and they know in their life and not what they were a month ago a year ago and we realized as believers lord we can't live off a past reputation is what is now in our life there's things lord that father in the past we we see it we're things that in the past where things would have been stood against her this is not done or this and then we find in present oh what's happened what's happened oh god we take of your mercy this morning not just not just your mercy lord not just saying oh god understands but no lord you're opening to us you're showing what's really lord what can be taking place around our life sometimes lord there's correction going on not always the sickness come for correction but sometimes you use it sometimes that's why it comes but lord i'm grateful you don't leave us wondering there's a discernment in this hour the sacrifice has been revealed and we recognize that the chastening of the lord is not only correction for wrong it's correction even admonition in the season we're in where the word will come to direct us for things that are to come in that coming day coming week coming season it's not always about where things are wrong [Music] oh god granted this morning lord throughout this congregation help us the lord i pray when as the chasing of the lord comes through tests and trials lord whether this morning it's test it's trial it's persecution there's correction lord but god we want to be in subjection we don't want to resist the correction we want to receive it lord we want to receive correction we want to receive it we don't want it lord and offer no excuses we want to receive correction help us lord help each and every one i know lord there's some setting here they're dealing lord with sickness in their body no doubt lord god there's things lord that this as far as with correction maybe they could relate to certain things but it has nothing to do maybe with correction in their life but father you don't leave us to wonder you minister so personally to our lives but we ask you lord for your grace now i pray father for us as an entire assembly [Music] dear god we cannot live on a picture of what we were a month ago what we were a year ago it won't do no good to complain about it your prophet told us complaining only weakens faith but may we lord god be his sons and daughters of god and look into the mirror of the word of god and say lord jesus if we've fallen short in an area lord forgive me help me to rise up lord god help me lord god to strengthen that area lord granted lord jesus help us lord god like the enemy was coming in against israel hezekiah begin to strengthen and fortify certain parts of the wall lord god as things come around it begins to show us maybe where there's little chinks in our armor gives us grace lord god to be able to tighten up the buckle lord help us i pray help us lord we're standing here the desire is one of these mornings that god when that sweep would come over the very atoms of these bodies would change just as the sweet come over our soul and brought a change in our nature we shall also change our vile bodies lord i asked father may we be able lord as children of god be able to say lord god by the grace of god by the grace of god right here this morning i'm not going to live off a past reputation i want to present myself before the lord i want every day of my life how many would like to make that declaration say god i invite you afresh into my life every day lord to be examined lord guide me lord as you're my father i'm your son or your daughter lord guide me direct me lord in this season i'm in i want to draw i want to draw close to you lord granted father we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen oh let's just continue to worship him just for a few moments [Music] don't you just appreciate him oh my i love him so much i think what would we do if he didn't come like this and didn't speak to us what would we do we'd be just like they were i need to keep doing this hey how many of you remember maybe you were in a church maybe you were writing a message pew you thought man i need to do this better i need it and god makes it known to you and says wait a minute wait wait wait wait your strength is going in the wrong way just let your strength be yielded to me get get weak so that i can pour my strength into you you watch him come there's no doubt testimonies throughout here i'm a witness there's witnesses all the way throughout here a lot of times friends you look in the church world they're not lazy people there's things that they put on and do i mean for the church and everything that's going on man events and things like that i was in a church down there and eating at a church that had a big old restaurant in south carolina where some of the dignitaries go i went into that church down in columbia i tell you they had a lot what do you say workers workers but you see it's not just about working but it's working under his leadership working under the vision of the lord you would ask them you say you believe you're doing a good thing they do you know bringing people in off the streets or holding this you know for for the drug addicts yeah they believe they're doing a good thing and that all has its part but i'm talking to us as the bride of jesus christ that you realize our strength is to be yielded to him to him and then he moves in oh i love him for that if you'd like to stand you're more welcome to stand up you've been sitting for a while
