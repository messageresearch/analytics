Christ amen and amen amen amen God bless you thank you musicians amen amen if you'll turn in your Bibles with me to Isaiah 53 amen it's so good to be gathered together and uh just want to just just take a little thought here tonight just a little something the Lord just dealing with my heart here this afternoon and actually was going to go continue with our series but I just just felt in my heart just to take this little thought here tonight and I want to read through Isaiah 53 and verse one we know that we're coming up here we're in a time of the Easter season and we realize that to us it's a great uh a memorial and we are truly benefactors of his resurrection but if there had not been a Calvary there would not be any resurrection and so Calvary itself is is sufficient amen that's where every debt where the sin question was settled and so we just want to take a reading here tonight and thinking of that in Isaiah 53:1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed and all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief and when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied and by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors amen amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to um just take a a few moments here I think the prayer request was given uh regarding of my Aunt Linda she you know we had special prayer for her on um sister Linda cavil as you know her uh she we had a special prayer for her here on Sunday and uh she was taken to the hospital there on early Saturday morning and um she uh um there was some things that even the other the other day when they went they had to put uh an emerg they had to put a a temporary port in for uh emergency kidney dialysis and uh so because the the blood pressure and all of that was real real low when they took her in and the toxins none of that was even uh being alleviated from her system so they were going to have to do that and uh when they went in to put that temporary port in um uh just there uh the other day day um when they went in to do that on on Wednesday they realized there was internal bleeding they didn't know where that was at and so they by the grace of God they found that real early this morning where that was at and they were able to uh get that cauterized get it stopped and uh so I right now I haven't heard any word whether they've been able to actually go in and do the uh dialysis that needed to to be done but we thank God for his mercy and where he has brought her to thus far and uh just as I mentioned there to her daughter my my my cousin and I told him I said you know God is in full control uh you know we're we're certainly looking to the Lord and uh you know uh as we were just praying and just holding her up before the Throne of God among many other needs that we know that are present in the assembly but I just ask that you just continue to keep her in prayer and then as we find out more we'll allow you to know I was actually going to go there today again but uh you know how it is when if they are in a process of maybe doing dialysis or not if they get to going on that then you kind of locked out for four to six hours there so uh we just I know that one thing that whether I'm there or not that the prayers will make it and so uh we I did take her greetings from everyone and told her said we're praying for you and we we miss you and uh we're just standing with you and and all of it and so um I got her to smile a little bit and talk to her and uh so it just just want to hold her up in prayer and I know there's many other needs as well uh sometimes in our minds and our lives there's so many needs and sometimes you know if you're like me you can become overwhelmed with the needs uh that that are all around and um but you know as I told you before one thing I've learned to do is to as it comes to me I pray uh whether I'm in here in a time of prayer or whether I've already that's already uh taking place if I'm driving in the car and somebody's name comes to me or the situation comes to my mind amen otherwise I'd have to walk around with a notebook and I I don't I could do that uh I tried to do that actually before when I have prayed and that isn't to me doesn't fit me too well so I'm just found just to be just to yield to him and and he he knows what we have need of so I believe that is what God would direct for each of us just to we're in mind we're a body and we pray one for another God knows the needs that we have I want to just take a thought out of this text here tonight I uh just just really pressing on my heart here early this afternoon on just to speak on the cost uh we're coming into a moment we know that uh and as it is laid out that tomorrow what is called Good Friday that there is the crucifixion and to look at that and I want to just take from that on and looking at the the part of of the cost and what it cost for us the cost of what it was for God to love me the cost of what it is you know and so when brother bham starts out with this I this message really stands out to me here the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our lives he said we're always happy when it comes to having the joy of the Lord in our midst and that's true isn't it we like the joy of the Lord and how I Rejoice with you greatly but did you ever stop to think think what it cost to have it did you ever realize just the price that's behind it and what judgment was and what the penalty of sin and how cruel sin must be when it caused the Son of God to go to Calvary and God would strike him and turn his face from him and smite him and he be afflicted look who he was how many know the scripture says he who knew no sin became sin not became sinful he became sin for what reason that we might be made the very righteousness of God in Christ he was willing to become that brother Bram goes on in the latter part of that message it says God in he says in prayer may every individual here go home tonight with this on their mind thinking of what a sacrifice what did it cost to redeem what did it cost God it never cost us nothing but it cost God his son it cost God the greatest Price it cost Christ his life he was the rose of Sharon but to get the Beautiful perfume out of a rose you have to crush it up and his beautiful life was crushed at a young man of 33 and a half years that we might live so that the purpose the cost that went to bring the joy that you and I would have tonight the cost in in order for us to be able to go free and to have the Liberty that we have tonight the cost that even that we even as individuals can come to a place of a real true relationship with almighty God there had to be a cost a price that was paid and you know we we glory in the resurrection and I I am so thankful we you know uh brother Steven will be here to stand in for us on Sunday morning morning and uh whether whether he takes the text out of the Resurrection or not every service and every day is a resurrection to the believer because we recognize that Resurrection is not just confined just to one day or just to one moment but the resurrection itself we we are true benefactors of that Resurrection we Are Witnesses of his resurrection that he is still the same yesterday today and forever but if there had not been a Calvary there would never have been a resurrection amen and in order for there to be a Calvary there had to be one who was willing to pay the price for you and I one who was willing to settle the debt that was against you and I because not there was not a mortal upon the earth that could actually satisfy this requirement for another mortal a lot of good people a lot of good men that no doubt had lived down through time but yet when even when you get to looking at the best man that you could maybe possibly pick every one of them were born in sin and shaped in iniquity and every one of them even to where that Joseph being such a perfect type of Christ he's still had a mark against him because he told a lie in telling them be deceptive and tell them that you are herdsmen and not Shepherds because the Egyptians despised Shepherds he also the prophet would let us know as we've spoke on here in the message a prisoner that Joseph after what God had showed him yet there was still a part that God saw that was too much Joseph in there and God knew he had to get him in position and while God was getting him in position God was also working out in his life every aspect and that even included that little bit of Pride that was still there so even the things as we've looked at the test and the trials and the things that we go through even the things sometimes that we are looking and asking of the Lord that Lord I I would love to see this pass but remember that as its coming and the trials and the things that we're in it's also to mold us to shape us and to lead us to a further death to ourselves that in the midst of it that it would be better and best for us to say is Lord mold Me In This Moment Lord help me gather Lord in this moment while while everything I'm waiting I want to commit all these things into your hands and Lord work on my life what needs to be worked out to where that when that next Junction of time comes I'm not only in position but I'm in position spiritually where I need to be in my life there's a cost that was that was made or that was given and no man could satisfy that cost but notice when we look at this in Isaiah 53:6 the very scripture here in the midst of our reading it says all we like sheep have gone astray here you know when man when the fall uh came Man became a Wonder we recognize that here that you know uh when they were the fall had come and God had had place man outside of the garden even man coming before the presence of God man man came and he brought fig leaves and he had sewed something together and you know how many moments did he walk around with those fig leaves I don't know but I know this that when God's presence came down in the garden that he did not have the confidence with what he had made to stand in the presence of God and so this is where we recognize it's more than religion amen religion is merely a covering but God never came to bring us religion because we've we have to have a confidence the Bible says that there should be a confidence in our life from The Book of John the confidence that would stand here a boldness that we're able to stand right now this moment and have that realization that I am here now as he is there he is the sinless Spotless lamb who was accepted and I am accepted in him and to have that boldness and aom confidence that doesn't mean arrogancy it means a rest that there is a sadl within that if my purpose should be fulfilled within the next few moments I'm not worried I'm not fearful I'm not wondering about where I'm going but there is a subtleness in my heart that I know in whom I have believed and I am persuad that he's able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day there there was a need for one to come and step forward to pay the price there would have to be one he could not be from this world because this world I'm not talking about the Earth I'm talking about the system on it he could not be here from this world because he could not redeem us everything in this world was polluted but there had to be one who was not sinful one who was not sin that would be able to step forward and redeem you and I now we understand redeem means to be brought back it means a a purchase that is made and that there's a rightful ownership and so there had to be one not only that could do it but was willing to do it one that was able as we sung that song to look beyond all of our faults and see what we really needed in other words not to render or withhold a payment based on who we were or being represented being representative of presently but one who knew us that down beneath the darkness of our life the actions and all of the conglomeration of sin that we were caught in there had to be one who was able to look Beyond it all and recognize his seed beneath it and come to redeem that seed because he never come to raise up the Fallen character that had went down you know to gather you and I and make us better and uh you know give us a a group of guidelines that we can go by and and repeat till we're blew in the face and you know become good and do this and do that that would never work because the nature is still wrong what was needed was is there was a need need for one to come to pay the debt every sin all that was against you and I that we could walk and go free and come back into Fellowship fully with God they had Fellowship under the blood of bulls and goats but it can never ever take away sin why it wasn't the sufficient cost Hallelujah man came in he could confess his sin he could lay his hands which he is all symbolizing to be identified with his sacrifice of where you and I are to come through Calvary but the man could walk right out of there after offering up the required offering and he would still in his heart have the same desire to do the same thing why because the blood of bulls and goats was not the sufficient cost to pay the price to loosen man from the hold of sin but there would be a blood that would be provided for you and I not a blood that's of already of this polluted substance of this Earth that's why that when God became one of us God stepped down and God created a body for himself to come and dwell in he did not need the agency or the help of man can you imagine that the Creator would need to borrow something from somebody else he's the Creator he doesn't need to B to borrow the atomic structure or the molecular structure from somebody else in order to make off of it he is the creator the almighty God and he stepped forward with this bloodline that was already polluted he created a blood cell and he wrapped himself in that blood cell and he created a tabernacle that he himself could come down and express himself he could feel the Feel The Temptations feel everything that we would go through and with the purpose for death that he might offer himself up once and for all for sin to pay the all sufficient price remember in the Old Testament they would have a day of atonement and remember they would offer that that up and that was a once a year they would come through the cleansing of the sanctuary and that spoke that there would come a sacrifice once and for all it was not something that needed to be repeated but once that sacrifice had been made once Calvary has come there does not need to be another offering for sin there has already been the sufficient offering for sin he is our Passover Lamb he is our unleavened bread he is our Pentecost he is our all and all amen he is the fruits of our in gathering he is everything to you and I as a Believer he has become all things to you and I God s forward because all of us all all had were like sheep that had gone astray a sheep a lost sheep is the most hopeless helpless thing it'll cry out bad bad it can get so tangled up and and everything we all like sheep why yet we were sheep this is what's important we were always sheep that means that there was one who was ordained to be our Shepherd that we would hear his voice and in sometime some moment of our life this might be your moment tonight that you recognize that you are a sheep that you are a real Lamb of God and that he is your Shepherd hallelujah hallelujah he came to redeem you and I he came to pay that cost but all like sheep have gone astray all just wondering about this is why even when you you think about it even man has wondered uh looking for eternal life or Eternal youth even as those who came from Spain and other Portugal and everywhere else to try to find a fountain of youth they were why why was it that they were long or search for something like that it showed there was something within man that was craving that of perfection who put that thirst in there God put that thirst in there but Satan loves to try to come and try to satisfy that thirst or try to fill it or quench it with other things but you know you can never satisfy that thirst look at it around in world and even with things that could come about in our life and you know you might have this vehicle but then a few years or just a few months or next year here the next year's model has this and that and or this person paints their house this way and all of a sudden now in the neighborhood what you were walking by and saying wow odd that color of a door now and now many people in the neighborhood have that color of door and then you have this all you see was Styles you see with other things why there's things that man is trying to satisfy it's he's looking for for something that would would satisfy him you were made with that thirst on the inside of you and there's nothing that will satisfy that and I'm just going to say this thank God there's nothing that you or I could ever find that would satisfy that thirst or we wouldn't be here tonight we tried to satisfy it we went after other things all like sheep have gone astray Hallelujah we walked according to the prince and power of the world we were being led by The Prince and power of the air sin didn't work in our members here we were within it all in need of a redeemer and here the Bible says we have turned everyone to his own way man just going according to his own way to his own devices man trying to find his way back there's something that longs think about with job as we've been preaching on job for a few years now think about throughout the the the the chapters not just one verse but throughout the chapters you find a chord that weaves all the way through the Book of Job where job is continually Desiring to come and actually sit down and talk with God he wanted to be able to talk with him man has had that desire why because we were a part of God and man had fellowship with God in that way in the Garden of Eden what caused that Fellowship to be broken sin and sin is not just this attribute of sin of drinking smoking and lusting and those are attributes sin is unbelief the reason those things are done is because of unbelief this is why there had to be one that could come to satisfy and deal with that unbelief in our life because a good man with good Constitution maybe would have you know the Resolute to stop this and not do this and I won't look at this and I'll stop this and all of those things are fine but you've got to remember it's got to go deeper than just your thinking about it or to have a thinking of Holiness it's got to come to a moment to where the love of God is so deep and so strong in your heart to where it's like that man that they had to tie when they would go by that island and the music was playing they had to tie him up so that he didn't turn the ship in there and they tear it all up but one day he got off that ship he went down there and he followed this music different music that was playing and he came into a little church and he was led to Calvary and the next time they came through there the Sailors looked at the captain and said should we tie you to the mass pole he said no you don't need to tie my hands no more for I've heard a sound that's so much sweeter than all of that music out there and that's the way the Lord Jesus that's the way the love of God becomes in the heart of a Believer it becomes sweeter than all sin ites turn his own way this is is one of the this was one of the things that we needed help with turning his own way because one of the one of the key components of that first birth is selfishness that's it's something that even after we have been filled with God's spirit that we have to continually put in subjection but it only comes by the spirit of God dwelling in us to give us discernment and recognize wait a minute that does not belong in this Temple that's because we've got a right to feelings right listen God didn't make us to be numb so feelings aren't bad but but but we we have a right remember like sheep we got a right we can we can have a right to hold on to things in our life or we can forsake it and yield it to the Lord because remember a sheep is meant also oo to produce wool and that wool is to be taken off is that right so Man became just a Wonder but longing for a place to where he can get back into the presence of God it would require a blood sacrifice remember it starts out with just Abel and Cain you know many times when we as we look at this you we we recognize that even with that of with Cain brought just the the best fruits that that could be brought he he wasn't a smart elic he built an altar he came to church he paid his tithes he did all those things but Cain himself when it came to recognizing God's provided way how would he know God's provided way you say it was Cain but remember God revealed his way to Abel and Abel offered up of that of the Lamb because it was revealed to Abel think about this both of them boys had been taught by their father and mother they had covered up their sin that's those boys did not know of what had taken place of an act in the garden but when God was going to get his message through the dev was going to get through into the camp and God seemed to it that God was going to get his message to Abel because Abel desired to worship God yeah you say didn't Cain desire to worship God let me tell you something God is not here tonight wondering or trying to find out about you or me or the next person he knows the depths of Our Lives already the Bible said in Romans n he said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated hated means L less he already knew them before they were ever formed in their mother's womb before any the Bible said having done good or evil and to tell you the truth following the scripture Esau was a much better man than Jacob Jacob was a Shyer and a deceiver he true but the difference was is Esau he despised or did not care for the birthright and the birthright being that blessing that belongs to the firstborn hallah being a type of the spirit of God the Holy Spirit coming to the firstborn coming to you say well I'm not the firstborn in my home but no I'm not talking about in your Earthly natural family tree lineage I'm talking about that you are always a part of God and Christ himself is the firstborn the firstborn of every creature you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world and remember the lamb the Passover Lamb the blood of the Lamb was meant in order to hang on to the firstborn the firstborn was redeemable but there had to be a blood of an innocent one that would stand on behalf of the firstborn and that's what God provided for you and I he made a way that we could have our life back that we should have had he made a way that we can come back into fellowship with God that you and I can have a real solid Victory and rest and stability in our life he made a way Hallelujah it would require blood and Abel stepping forward and notice Cain as we said moments ago Cain you say well how what how what could Cain do Cain could see the witness of the Holy Spirit accepting right Abel's sacrifice Abel was only offering up what he's what was revealed to him you know you can only live according to what's revealed to you you can't live according to what you see somebody else doing that's why you've got to have a personal revelation like brother Paul was preaching here catching a vision you personally meeting God it's got to be a personal revelation it can't be well Daddy said this mama said this or the prophet said this all of those things are to declare to you that he is a living God and he wants to be your God he wants to be personal to you is that all right yes this is why that Revelation so here God lets him know to Cain hey if you do well do like your brother you'll be accepted but Cain refused it and walked away God God had accepted Abel and God was showing the pattern all the way down that he would reveal the provided acceptable way for every one of his children God finds you and I right where we're at God leads us in the time we're at listen this is why I'm saying this don't look at somebody else you look to God for your own life and where you're at right now listen don't make excuses for it don't look for reason just say God I want to know you Lord in such a personal way Lord I I don't want to look at you through veils of veils of my ideas veils of my thoughts veils of this person veils of hurt veils of this I'm Lord God you have torn every Veil that is that is there I don't want to look through veils I want to see you I tell you where there is a hunger for for that there are veils to be broken and let me just tell you something when a heart begins to get hungry for God let me tell you why that is that's because the Bible has said draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh unto you I'm telling you what's happening is it's just like Rahab Rahab was hearing what was going on and she began to think about what was happening here the presence of the Lord was drawing n to her house she didn't think about it that day wondering like what was going to happen she' had no idea there was a visitation coming there but you know what there was the promise draw nine to God and he'll draw nine to you here came the message that God was stirring in her heart for deliverance and God sent a message it was not because of Rahab it was God who put that hunger in her heart and when God puts the hunger in your heart that's God letting you know he's on the road to meet your need Hall hallu oh my the cost was so great think about this in Romans 5:6 think about this it's just this scripture here just meditating on it today for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet per adventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us prise the Lord while we were no good even think about it knowing that we would come into this life decisions we would make but let me just tell you something when he was there in gemany those scriptures we read out of Isaiah 53 you find it it is written in past tense he was wounded he was bruised because in the mind of God the lamb was already slain Isaiah was caught up remember a a prophet is not speaking a new word but a prophet is being caught up and he is catching the word that's already been spoken is that right he's moving out of these Realms and what's happening it's introducing the heavenly down here in this Earthly realm because there are subjects that are of God ordained to hear that and are a part of that word and to think of how that within this God knowing everything before anything had ever transpired where you and I would be but God already he made a way he paid the price he settled the debt the cost that was needed he paid that cost amen while we were yet sinners we were enemies the Bible says alienated by Wicked Works in our minds that's right so he didn't listen God did not come down for necessarily because we were friendly God came and paid the price but it wasn't because of the condition of that he was looking at he was looking down beneath all of that and he saw the real need I say God if he has done that for me and that same life has come to me then that's how my eyes should look to to look Beyond situations to look Beyond grievances to look Beyond hurts to look Beyond everything even when I'm witnessing to somebody to be able to look beyond the condition they might have tattoos up one side and down the other they might have rings as big as hula hoops but oh God let me look beyond what I'm seeing Lord on the outside and recognize that down on the inside is a son and daughter of God potentially yes sir that's what he did that's what he did Hallelujah 1 Timothy 2:5 for there is one God and one mediator between God and man and Men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransome for all to be testified in due time aren't you glad for that he gave himself a ransom for all thinking about the cost that it made I I think of how brother R would talk about that time you remember where that that young lady got off that train and she was her mother was standing there and you know waving to her and and her mother was so glad to see her come home that young lady got off that train she wouldn't even look at her that was her mama she wouldn't look at her she walked on by she wanted to ignore her you know why because her mother you know the story but just bear with me a moment cuz it's very fitting there was a house fire and here she was as a little girl her mother who is standing there scarred as brother Brown would describe just so things you know are flesh and things so burned up and you know the things how that could possibly be but she grabbed a blanket and she swaddled that little girl and carried her through the Flames out through safety she took the heat she became ugly so that her daughter might be beautiful I'm telling you God himself not the second person but God came down job said I know my redeemer liveth hallah he's alive and God stepped down and he himself became despised rejected no Beauty we should desire him he took the full brunt of sin the Bible said the Lord it pleased the Lord to bruise him where when the meat was hanging off of his back to see the ribs the crown of thorns for our mind battles the stripes that he bore for our healing hallelujah hallelujah he had the weight of the sin think about how you feel or I feel when we have done wrong and how that maybe it was just something that we didn't even say maybe it's the way that in our heart we know the perception behind it and it was Smite our heart think about how that feels to you and I that's right he had the whole weight of the sin of the world he himself became our sin Bearer amen all of the sin was placed upon him remember in the Old Testament when two Rams two of the goats would be would be offered up one would be offered up and the other the blood of that goat then how would come about and it would be placed on the other goat and that goat itself self would be called the scapegoat they would take that goat and a man who was an able man was commissioned to take that goat and Lead it out into the Wilderness and leave that goat there and walk back without that goat you say what happened to that goat no doubt the wild animals tore it all to pieces no doubt they got all of that but you know what that scape goat represented it represented the sins of the children of Israel and they were not going to see that goat walk back in again let me tell you something that God himself when he comes to you and I he's not making known to you or rubbing your face in your condition he's letting you know I've already paid the price the cost has been settled hallu a man or a woman that chooses they choose to live under that they choose it because now there's no longer such a thing as just walking under the blood of bulls and goats there's no such thing as just temporary there's no such thing as just partial right now is fully available amen through a New and Living Way through his flesh through the opening of the Riven Veil a place that you and I can come right back into fellowship with almighty God the cost as I said the resurrection how wonderful how tremendous because he raised for our justification that raising getting up on that e Easter morning it proved he was who he said he was even deware that those who didn't understand that had hap what had taken place what were they sheep Smite the shepherd it'll scatter the Sheep but they're still sheep they might be scattered but they're still sheep all it takes is the shepherd's voice to gather the sheep and the shepherd goes and gathers the sheep and lets them know everything is right in line and right in order that indeed Redemption has come you know what that meant for them now is made the promise available of the Holy Ghost why because the cost the cost has been satisfied I want you to think of that he who knew no sin became sin Paul would write it like this in Galatians 6:14 God forbid that I should Glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world that's so yes sir he made a way I want to just I want to take you here to one place in 2 Samuel 24 this this portion of of the scripture really just striking my heart here this afternoon remember that David God had moved David had moved him to number Israel and then here how God you know there was a judgment That Came Upon Israel because God was God was moved against Israel and David David was moved then to have them numbered and a pestilence came in a plague came in among them and this is where David remember David did not ask of this it was a choice of three things and David remember said let us just fall into to the mercies of God so a plague had come upon the people let me just tell you like this there was a plague When sin entered there was a plague that came as a matter of fact When sin came paralysis struck the human race Amnesia struck the human race that's so good because what God had ordained and created man to be as a son and daughter of God he was paralyzed to that unable to walk there would be glimpses of it we would see glimpses in Elijah we would see glimpses in Moses we would see glimpses but no one had expressed what the first Adam was like until the second Adam came are you hearing me there were glimpses but there came forth one who was worthy and when he hear the worthy one standing there all the wonderful men that the spirit of God would move upon and pull back and we could see glimpes where they would operate under the word or that blood that type that was given like Moses they would speak things there in Egypt they would operate under that un with an authority but only one would show us what that first Adam was like and let me just tell you this right here in this end time God started out a church on the day of Pentecost but by the time it got to the Ephesian age it was a fallen woman but God in the end time promised there would come in the days of the revealing of the son of man that once again the same Lord Jesus the second Adam would come and in his fullness and make himself known not just a portion as it had been down through the Seven Ages each one of those colors of the rainbow but it would all be joined together because God is light and every one of those parts are in light and God would be gathered together and God would show to you and I in this end time not that it would be highlighted just upon a man but God would take a vessel and show you and I of what he's calling us to as Sons and Daughters of God it's not for me or you that we have to stand on the platform and discern no that that office has been fulfilled but God has brought it to you and I to where there's a people back on Earth that will believe every word of God Hallelujah it was a cost for this message to come to you and I Hallelujah there was a cost within it amen now let me just get into this here just a few moments let me just have just a few moments here here Gad In Verse 18 now watch how this leadership is coming on how to stay the plague Gad is the prophet Gad came to David and he said unto him go up and rear up an altar unto the Lord in the threshing floor of Arana the jebusite and David according to the saying of G notice we could preach on that a little bit but David according to the saying of GAD went up as the Lord commanded you see David knew Gad is the Lord spokesman so what God has said it's not actually God it's the Lord so I'm doing as God said as the Lord commanded Paul said follow me as I follow Christ and Arana looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him and Arana went out and bound himself before the King on his face upon the ground and AR said wherefore is my Lord the king come to his servant and David said to buy the threshing floor of thee to build an altar unto the Lord that the plague may be stayed from the people so the way that the plague is going to be stopped there's got to be an altar and a sacrifice made that's the only thing that can ever stop the plague that's the only thing that can deal with the sin question we must have a sacrifice a place provided an ordained place for the altar to be raised upall Hallelujah and AR said unto David let my Lord the king Take now watch this and offer up what Seth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of The Oxen for wood and these things did Arana as King as a king gave give unto the king and Arana said unto the king the Lord thy God accept thee but the king and the King said unto Arana nay but I will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which cost me nothing hallah in other words I'm not a freeloader I know it's going to cost me something in order for the plague to be stayed I can't take your your oxen I can't take from you I must provide for myself the sacrifice and David purchased not only the ground right for the altar but he purchased the sacrifice that was needed God showing a type of himself that God was not going to take out of that of human Humanity that was already polluted but God himself would come and pay the sufficient cost it would not be a cheap price it would cost him the life of his dearly beloved Son for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life God provided for himself like he did for Abraham on Mount Mariah God provided a sacrifice for himself all the way through the scripture it's God providing for himself that's good I'm not going to give you something that don't cost me anything thing see that's where that's even where things have come to and have been all the way down through time is man wants to do what little they can they can do or want to do they'll put lies on the altar they'll put all they'll do all sorts of things Paul even said they would speak in tongues nothing wrong with speaking in tongues but Paul said they can speak in tongues prophesy have visions they can even understand all Mysteries and have all of that and still not be a surrendered life men will study and study and all sorts of things and they'll do everything to dodge a full surrender you and I can never make ourself good enough the cost has been made Calvary made a way that every son and daughter of God can have a real [Applause] Calvary I'm not going to offer God something that don't cost me anything that'd be like you offering me a shirt out of your closet that you don't ever wear oh here no problem Lord I'll give you this one I'll give you this let me remind you the Rich Young Ruler his decision was not about Sin in his life you couldn't have laid one finger on that was not wrong to have riches that's right if he was looking under the dos and don'ts of the message is it wrong to have Rich riches it was nothing wrong with it no that's right but what was wrong is he valued one little thing above a full surrender am and God was dealing with the cost in his life I tell you it'll cost you things it will cost you but the main thing that it cost you is it'll cost you your life Hallelujah listen friends you can live your life trying to say do we do this do we don't do that do we do this do we don't do this you are a weary miserable person because you're always going to be guessing do I do this do I do this can we do this can I do that and it always becomes like Ruth laboring in the field weary legalist but the goal is rest it's rest it's about a love affair there's things that my wife can ask of me right now I'm not looking at a Lisk of what is required I do this and do that but there are things that you know what it don't bother me to go beyond when there's little things that arise and things that comes up maybe she asked me to alter my schedule here or alter it there but it's my love for her that's good if that's fial love towards your spouse how much greater is the agape love I'm telling you friend this is why when a person when a life this is what you ought to press for with everything within you listen you know I'm talking right down your alley tonight you can't live just by your own love it's got to take the love of God in your life and this is why the prophet said when you get to a place that you love God so much he said then will come the baptism of the love of God down into your heart but you know what happens sometimes is that old first thing that old first nature of Pride we want God to do it all God you've got to come and take it all Lord you're going to have to do this no no be like David I ain't going to offer him something that don't cost me nothing I don't want somebody else's sacrifice Hallelujah I don't want somebody I I I must have my own sacrifice and God made a way through Calvary that you and I can sacrifice our own life unto him before Calvary that was impossible there were types but it was impossible to come into that full sacrificial life but Calvary made a way for it the Bible said the land was intreated for that and the plague was stayed from Israel oh God help us tonight amen God help us and give us Grace friends listen there's nothing wrong with works but I'm I'm telling you tonight the cost has been already satisfied you don't have to live under that any longer you say what are you talking about I I I'll give you an example of where God brought me from it was so easy to fall off the wagon but it's got to be something that's deeper than just doing this and doing that it's a place that we can come to and God he made a way listen those Pharisees you couldn't lay a finger the prophet tells us upon their lives their dos and don'ts was spotless right but the word discerned their need inside they were full of dead men's bones inside stepen even caught the same thing that the Lord Jesus Steven could say you have resisted the Holy Ghost even as your fathers it was the Holy Ghost that anointed Jeremiah anointed Isaiah anointed them all the way down and they rejected the voice of Christ all the way down through there and the atonement standing right in front of them they rejected the atonement where Abraham's seed huh who are you to tell us do you know who we are we can give you our pedigree let me tell you something it didn't matter their pedigree when it came down to it What mattered is is did they have a soul on the inside that could hear God and could would respond to the voice of almighty God that's what matters and when you are just in tune with that and hearing the spirit of God friends move in that channel be like a salmon that's going Upstream you might have to fight against all everything that's come in your way but that's the call of the birth lands it's a call to get back there and let the salmon go up the stream back to the place Where We Belong the cost if there had been no cost right no Calvary the cost would never have been paid but there was a there was a Calvary and a Calvary was made so that we could have our own Calvary we could come to a place of death to ourselves death to our ideas that's why the church itself it's not just it's not just something we come together serving God is not something we do a couple days out of the out of the week and a few times out of the month and we serving God is our life it's not something that I want you to understand me we're it's not something as like a menite or an Amish order that's not what it is it's serving God under the birthright it's serving God under the Holy Spirit where it brings his life on the inside of you where it's no longer you living you don't even have to try it's not you trying to live a right life it's not you trying to do what's right it's Christ in you living out his own life how many times the prophet says it it sounds silly but how many times he say it if I had the spirit of bethoven in me what would you expect you expect me to be a football player no if the spirit of Beethoven is in me you would expect me to write symphonies and if the spirit of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's the purpose of Calvary Calvary did not come to make churches Calvary did not come to bring a gathering of people Calvary came in order to satisfy the debt in order that that life might be imparted to you and I amen he made a way yes he did that we could follow him back into the presence of God the cost think about it let's bow our heads Wonder as we bow our heads in prayer would be one that would want to be remembered in prayer tonight some maybe in some way that the Lord is spoke to your heart across some point some thought you want to be remembered in prayer tonight say Lord remember me God bless you bless your hands God knows what we we have need of he knows exactly Heavenly Father Lord Jesus as we stand here Lord and In This Moment Lord on a Thursday evening to consider Lord as we're standing Lord at this Easter week and Lord as we look Lord tomorrow being that of Good Friday and Lord to thank about even all of the ways that Lord when you became one of us and that the cost that was needed to satisfy that to satisfi to pay the debt oh Lord and what it means to us I realize Lord that many many things Lord were many much of Christianity will just rally and gather around oh I'm so thankful he came to go to Calvary I'm so thankful that he he made a way for me and I realize Lord each one has their part but that's not really what Calvary was all about Lord to look at Calvary and to recognize that Not only was that sin debt paid but like your Prophet says Lord the very backbone of Satan was broke on Calvary where the sin question was settled Lord God we're like Moses himself familiar passages of scripture in John 3 as Moses raised up that Brazen serpent in the wilderness Soul likewise the son of man must be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life Lord showing we see it even on the medical we can go to a hospital go on an ambulance what do we see see we see a pole with a serpent on it it represents [Music] medicine but yet we realize that's a symbol where did that come from well it might have been somebody here or there down Through the Ages but I find it quite striking because Lord we realize that that serpent itself represents sin it was in possible for Adam himself but sin was introduced into the human race Lord we realize we read back in the scriptures the serpent the Bible says was a subtle Beast not a reptile a subtle Beast more subtle than all the beasts of the field then why do we have it represented as a serpent that way on the pole because the Lord Lord when it came time for Reckoning you handed out all everything that would be done Adam and Eve they would have to Adam would would toore by the sweat of his brow he would earn his keep how that you would speak to her the woman and you would say at that [Music] time that desire shall be to thy husband because that order had been broken she had got out of that order then as you would speak to that serpent upon thy belly Thou shalt go right there was changed from an upright being no longer can that mingle with that of the human race dust shall be thy [Music] meat Lord Jesus here we walk around in these dust flesh bodies we had Lord we came to this world like job could write David could write man who's born of sin is a few days old in a full of trouble nobody had to teach us how to do wrong it was already inbred in US it came with us care package of the first birth of that Union between Satan through the serpent and Eve we came with a snake bite condition in our [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] nature so much so to where the scripture could say and we have an witness in our hearts we are not the old man made over we are a new creation in Christ Jesus oh God how we thank you Lord you made a way through Calvary that we could be born again without Calvary there would have been no way possible but you made a way that we could follow you Lord I pray here tonight I'm asking that Lord right here in this [Music] service Lord I believe truly that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord you know Lord even the things that was on my heart I was ready to minister Lord today but as you would direct this Lord God here this afternoon Lord I know there's needs there's needs among us because as We Gather we're needy people now Lord you know the depth of the need you know what need it is in our life and Lord I pray May every Veil Lord May every spiritual Veil whatever might be that Lord may be holding someone back lord I pray that may Lord God you move down lord may they respond to your voice Lord realizing that they don't have to live live beneath their privileges any longer they don't have to live Lord God a life of wondering but Lord God can live not by something that we can present to you and do this and do that no Calvary lifted us above not our works as the scripture said not of Works lest we should boast but it's the grace of God that has come teaching us showing us enlightening us dealing with our hearts drawing us Lord God we want to yield to your voice tonight as your sheep as the shepherd himself moving through the building making known I've paid the price you're free my son my daughter you don't have to keep hoing along and and moving along with that that utensil of the world you don't have to hold on to that you don't have to be on a slave any longer I have made a way for you to walk free Hallelujah through my blood that has been shed for you I've made a way it's not what you can do you can never get good enough it's to accept what he has done for you accept his provided way and walk in it Lord I pray God for every other request every need Lord behind the hands of your children children Lord Jesus may you minister to every need Lord I believe that dear God that we could all say Lord I want more of you I need more of you help us Lord everything that we would receive there's a cost behind it sometimes Lord in order to see things your Prophet would say if we really want to see he said how many is he asked the Tabernacle how many want to really see a Bible Church he said it's going to cost you something he said it'll be a sacrifice he said it won't be so much of money but it's going to cost you to sacrifice some time in prayer sacrifice your own ideas sacrifice your own thoughts sacrifice your own feelings Lord help us help us Lord this is what Calvary Lord God leads us to it leads us to live for one another not just for the people people who would we would esteem in our own eyes as worthy of us living for but Lord your Prophet tells us in that message that day on Calvary he said live for the man who would kill you if he could that's what Jesus did he lived even

way and we're standing here only because you made and we stand standing here only because you made Lord we standing here only because you made the way Hallelujah I love this scripture here I want to I I love this one of my favorite scriptures Paul says out of Galatians to and thinking about this tonight Paul said I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me am so good so hallelujah what are we to live by what are we living by is by that Revelation that God loves me he did it for me I was always included and I was always a part of him and when that's that that strikes our heart that's why brother Bram he makes that statement and you know he's he's talked about how that we can stand as a Believer he says you know he said actually he said taking a baby a baby is very innocent because a baby's not even come to that age of accountability but he said every son and daughter of God that's been born again is more innocent than a baby that's what the New Birth has done for you and [Music] I I got a letter in one of my files the brothers had given me we sister brother Jim EDS brother at Dalton out there at Pastor Flagstaff Tabernacle his his wife had written to brother brandham about because she know she was her birth was outside of wedlock and she wrote to brother bradam she you know was reading from the Old Testament all those things you know brother bam addresses it later on in the message there in ' 64 but he wrot wrote back it just he takes he took the letter and he just he took the letter and then just wrote it up on the side he said he said sister Dalton he said don't worry about that he said the new birth corrected that and all every other thing that's what the new birth does the new birth gives you the authority to say that claims that would want to come down through that natural family tree the new birth gives you the authority to say not here not here not here not here that's what the new birth gives you the authority to do what the blood of bulls and animals could never take away it wasn't strong enough but the blood of the Lord Jesus the blood of Christ as Peter called it it was strong enough to deal with every question of sin and I tell you tonight sure we as Believers we press we do press we battle every day and how many know there's a difference between when it's just something you're trying to live to gain favor to God and when you know you found favor with him there's a rest that's come in your heart in your life I say let's let's press on no matter where you're at in your journey press on press on to life you know look it's like it's like that salmon we talked about brother BR said there's only one stream he said there's a stream and it only goes one way he said it don't go two ways it's only one way but you get in that stream and that's a spirit of God it's bringing you into that stream of life it's taking you right into Calvary and it just keeps raising you up higher and higher and higher and higher and you find the things of this world it's not what you're trying to stop but you're just becoming more in love with him the whole time as you're surrendering and it's not you stopping it it's sin Stopping You Hallelujah because you are always a son and daughter of God Amen and it's God getting your will lined up with his will and then it becomes a channel where the paralysis is broken where Amnesia is done away with and where God moves through branches of Sons and Daughters of God and manifest his glory don't you love him tonight amen aren't you thankful for for the price that he paid may God help us even as we think about it tomorrow I know we'll be in different places but even to consider that to think about it just to slip away Lord thank you for what you've made away from me thank you Lord for what you've done that I might have life and have it more abundantly that I might have healing in my body that I might have strength Lord you who are willing as the scripture recounts to us he came to such he came as it records in The Book of Mark when you look up one of the words he came to what is would would be described the Apex of depression he came to that spot those words portray that why did he do that because he knew some of his children we would go through times of depression anxiety we would go through situations that would come our way fear would want to come but he made a way that you and I he was willing thank you Lord to become sin that we might become his righteousness he was willing to forsake his sunship in order to make Sinners Sons he was willing to forsake his peace go to the lowest parts of Hell deposit the sin and Rise Up on that Easter morning he was willing why so you and I could have peace oh Hallelujah he went somewhere where I'll never have to go Hallelujah let me tell you tonight hell is not made for you the Bible said hell was created for the devil and his angels I'm glad I'll never have to see that place I'm thankful that he gave me a life he gave me the strength was needed I was without strength but he provided a way that I might receive his strength to live for him oh hallelujah what love what love is this not that we were worthy not that we were righteous but he's the worthy one he's the righteous one and when he's dealing with your heart don't look at yourself look to him who's speaking to you because he who speaking to you he's the answer the sufficiency the atonement all that's needed to take care of whatever your need is he's more than enough you believe that tonight Hallelujah I want to live the way that he wants me to live I want to give onto you there's just no more to oh I want to love yeah you can there's just no more oh I could never ever out love Lord Brother Gabriel's got a testimony as he comes give sing one more time I want to live the way he wants me to live I won't [Music] again till there's just no more to he I won't love love till there's just no more oh I could never ever around [Music] love good evening everyone um the company I work at I'm responsible for these lamps that go on our machines that go for testing and uh while I was assembling the boxes and the lamps to go in the boxes I only had a certain number I said well I got like three or four left over and so then I was getting towards the end all I found like three or four had without we missing what they call locking tabs that where the Box assembled and it secures it and I looked at had one I had there a half a tab I said oh okay we're going to cut it close so when I got to the last one I put it together and I had exact number and then I uh I walked off and raised my I said my heart I said Thank you Lord for helping me with this and a voice said I said remember brother Bram said don't make yourself weird so I walked back to where I was to where I was working I ra my hands closed my eyes I said God thank you for helping me no matter what it was said so then I started thinking about the machines that the little tape dispensers I used to assemble the boxes I had requested them before and I would sit there and have to pull the tape out and put it on the table in order to put the box together and so I asked why can't we just buy an electric dispenser and they they um they gave me I had some books I started looking it up it's like $700 just for one the cost and so I said okay well I just kept going so I asked the boss he don't worry about that said okay so I kept going and finally when they I guess the word got around to the purchasers and they they came down so we're going to get one for that's fine I that's great so when they finally came in I was so glass man now they accelerate the work a little quicker and so um they said the vice president came I said we're going to get you guys another one said two that's even better yet so both me and the fellow I work with we can accelerate the work and so then um I started going over where the lamps had to be rolled in the cardboard and a fell named Barry came by the purchaser how's it going that's going really good I'm grateful then I felt checked a second time I said Lord if you give me a second chance I'll go talk to him and witness to him so then I went on break I was going through our assembly of our company I ran into him I said Barry Oh I said I asked him I said do you believe in God I said yes I do I said so do I I said you tell those folks who purchase those things they are God send that's I want to tell you thank you and so then I went back and finished it and so then um the third thing that happened I saw my boss and he through God through he has been really generous to me really kind to me I saw him walking with o limp I said he's suffering something's wrong so I started praying for him in my heart said Lord if you give me a chance I'll go witness to him so that I didn't get a chance to do it um today but maybe Monday and I said I want to go Express to him I said where I go to church we pray for the sick I said if you believe in God God can heal you whatever it is so I just praying for my heart all day long for them said Lord be with Tom gross my boss who's been really kind and generous to me so I just ask and pray that God touch him this weekend that he'll come back well so no matter what it is no matter how small it is if it's for yourself or anyone else that God has an interest and his desire to make us happy no matter how small it is and so I look at those two little those black boxes which are tape dispensers that I I thought I didn't know when I was going to get them or I was ever going to get them but got they they made my job a little easier and makes my heart light say God whenever I turn those things I I'm grateful to God that I have a little tool that helps me at my job that he's provided for me thank you Lord Jesus amen Lord amen amen God watches out for us in the big things the little things and he watches out how many can testify God watch out for me on my job many many times praise God God bless you brother Gabriel thank you for sharing that amen let's just go before the Lord in prayer and just thank him for his goodness Lord Lord first of all I think the first thing we can say after that service tonight thank you for Calvary Lord Jesus thank you for the sacrifice that you made and as our brother said Lord do it cost you something to to save our souls Lord it'll cost us something to serve you oh Lord let us not be like the Rich Young Ruler who valued his his riches and his father's riches over over over uh over his relationship with God but may we go through our lives Lord help us to check if there's anything in our life that we're valuing more than it should be and putting it above and beyond the word of God Lord forgive us Lord Jesus show it to us Lord we'll make it right Lord and help us to give those things up Lord so that you can have your perfect will in our life Lord and we can follow that stream as a brother was saying at the end of the service just follow that stream straight straight into the life of God lord we love you tonight Lord all those that that was sick that we prayed for Lord we pray the Holy Spirit would go out to them and touch them Lord and my brother and sisters oh my precious brothers and sisters here Lord as they go back to their jobs and their homes Lord I pray that you'd bless them Lord give them strength Lord May the Holy Ghost guide them Lord May the joy of the Lord be in their hearts knowing that what you've done for us Lord no matter what we face no matter how how difficult our situation may be you died for our sins Lord and it doesn't matter where we're at right now cuz we know where we're going so we thank you for that Lord bless your children and be with us until we should meet again in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you all may the Lord be with you man watch over here till we should meet again on a hill far away stood and old get cross the emblem of s [Music] and and I love that old cross where the dearest stand
