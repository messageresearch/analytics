[33:58] great blessing a great friendship
[34:01] and i can say this without
[34:03] any reservation
[34:05] this this assembly
[34:07] has benefited
[34:09] and has rose higher because of the
[34:11] ministry of brother roe el soriano

[40:29] i write unto you little children because
[40:31] your sins are forgiven you for his
[40:33] name's sake
[40:35] i write unto you fathers because you
[40:37] have known him
[40:39] that is from the beginning
[40:41] i write unto you young men because ye
[40:44] have overcome
[40:45] the wicked one
[40:47] and i write unto you little children
[40:49] because ye have known the father
[40:52] and i have written unto you fathers
[40:54] because you have known him that is from
[40:56] the beginning
[40:58] i have written unto you young men
[40:59] because you are strong and the word of
[41:01] god
[41:02] abideth in you and you have overcome
[41:06] the wicked one amen may god bless you
[41:09] bless the reading of the word as you're
[41:10] being seated would you turn with me to
[41:12] john chapter 14 as well
[41:16] and as you're turning there to john 14
[41:18] as we look into this passage of
[41:19] scripture
[41:22] i want you to notice that in what we
[41:24] have read here this morning
[41:27] i have written unto you fathers and
[41:29] in those three scriptures
[41:32] it would seem as though that john is
[41:34] repeating but
[41:35] is not repeating there's a purpose
[41:39] in this writing
[41:40] and it's not
[41:42] something that john
[41:44] is doing on his own
[41:46] but john is under the leadership of the
[41:49] holy spirit
[41:50] and when he's writing to that of the
[41:53] fathers the children to the young men to
[41:56] all that are there there's a purpose and
[41:58] how many know that their god in christ
[42:01] we have a purpose
[42:04] you know there's a lot of things that we
[42:06] can go through life and you can try to
[42:08] find out what your purpose is and the
[42:10] scripture will always declare there is
[42:13] one central purpose
[42:15] when paul writes through the inspiration
[42:19] of the holy spirit to titus he lets us
[42:22] know that our our purpose and calling
[42:25] was brought to light through the
[42:27] manifestation of jesus christ paul also
[42:31] writes in the book of romans that all
[42:33] things
[42:34] that come about in our life work
[42:37] together
[42:38] for the good to them that are called
[42:40] according to his purpose
[42:43] within the purpose of god because the
[42:46] purpose of god is that our lives would
[42:48] be
[42:49] dramatized by the holy spirit
[42:52] that we would be born again that's what
[42:55] the prophet would set forth by the
[42:57] scriptures that's the main purpose that
[43:00] we're here on earth to do
[43:02] but all of the other purposes father
[43:05] mother all of those things when you know
[43:08] you go into the adoption series and
[43:10] brother branham lays that out very
[43:11] clearly in the adoption series he says
[43:14] where you have served god's purpose as a
[43:16] housewife as a father
[43:18] as a mother as a doctor he goes through
[43:21] all of those parts because those parts
[43:23] are not just
[43:25] menial parts but a very significant part
[43:28] within the purpose of almighty god
[43:30] and so whatever when you look at even in
[43:33] your life and you know occupation
[43:36] whatever it is there's a purpose in your
[43:38] life from a young person middle age on
[43:40] and on and let me just say this to you
[43:42] so you to draw comfort from it and it
[43:44] also uh really uh stirs us that as long
[43:49] as we're here upon this earth god's
[43:52] purpose is still going forward in our
[43:54] lives
[43:56] there's no retirement from the purpose
[43:58] of god
[44:00] you know god doesn't hand out a golden
[44:02] buckeye card for you know the purpose of
[44:04] god you've served your years but what
[44:06] happens is this transitions that happens
[44:09] in our lives
[44:10] and those are things that we realize as
[44:12] long as we're here there's a purpose and
[44:14] a reason and that's why brother brahms
[44:16] said when god is finished and the
[44:18] purpose my purpose has been served here
[44:21] on earth that i'm ready to go home
[44:23] it's just like a person acting out in a
[44:25] drama once their part is done they they
[44:28] go off the stage but as long as they're
[44:30] out here
[44:31] and they're awaiting they are coming
[44:33] into their purpose now that purpose i'm
[44:36] thankful that even the purposes that are
[44:39] clear in our life father mother and
[44:41] those whatever even if the things that
[44:43] god has revealed with your occupation
[44:45] and the things that you do
[44:47] those things continually are unfolded by
[44:51] the holy spirit
[44:52] because all of it is in god we we don't
[44:55] find out well you know uh you know i'm a
[44:58] nurse and i found out i was a nurse
[45:00] because so and so no that was already
[45:02] packed within your life
[45:05] it was already there remember when god
[45:07] revealed to moses in the vision the
[45:09] tabernacle god said by the way i have
[45:12] already put in men like bezel the spirit
[45:15] of wisdom
[45:17] they are skilled to do these things
[45:20] you and i come to understand what the
[45:22] skills and things that god has placed
[45:24] within us
[45:25] no man you might say well i learned this
[45:27] trade from so and so the skill was
[45:29] already in you
[45:30] those things were already in you and to
[45:32] think how god could actually move and
[45:35] direct that within our life because he
[45:37] is jehovah jireh
[45:40] god that even what he's placed in your
[45:42] life it is god testifying i am jehovah
[45:45] jireh i have not put you here without
[45:48] there being provision
[45:50] isn't that a comfort
[45:51] in everything of our life now our
[45:54] sometimes our stress and our part of it
[45:56] is trying to figure out all of that but
[45:58] i'm glad we don't have to figure it out
[46:00] we just look to him
[46:02] we look to god we're praying and feeding
[46:04] on the word of god and look with an
[46:06] expectation for inspiration to come and
[46:09] to direct us
[46:11] i'm speaking by experience on there i
[46:13] have written unto you so there's there's
[46:15] a purpose that god has set forth there
[46:17] within our life and i want to read here
[46:20] out of john chapter 14 verse 4
[46:22] and here hear the lord jesus speaking
[46:25] with the disciples and he says whether i
[46:27] go ye know and the way
[46:30] ye know
[46:31] and thomas said unto him lord we know
[46:33] not whether thou go us and how can we
[46:36] know the way so he's told them you know
[46:38] the way and thomas saying but how we
[46:41] don't know the way how what what is the
[46:43] way and notice
[46:45] jesus says
[46:46] i am the way the truth and the life
[46:50] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[46:54] so the way was not a written
[46:58] code
[47:00] the way was a person
[47:03] now this person who is the way
[47:06] it was matching
[47:08] all that the word had prophesied
[47:11] so when the word so the way becomes
[47:14] known when the word itself becomes
[47:17] manifest in the light
[47:19] so the lord jesus is declaring to them i
[47:23] am that way
[47:24] you've known the way lord where's the
[47:26] way where's the no i am the way
[47:29] the truth and the life
[47:31] so person so truth
[47:34] uh doctrine is not it's not it's not uh
[47:38] or truth is not confined to doctrine
[47:40] truth is the person of jesus christ
[47:47] truth is not an anointing truth is the
[47:50] person of jesus christ
[47:55] it's not a teaching it's the person of
[47:57] jesus christ
[47:59] and because let me just say it in this
[48:01] way when we that person because you
[48:04] can't have a relationship with a
[48:06] doctrine
[48:07] that's right
[48:08] you can't have a relationship with the
[48:10] teaching
[48:12] but you can have a relationship with the
[48:14] person of jesus christ
[48:18] and when you have a relationship with
[48:20] him
[48:21] you
[48:22] are partakers of all that he
[48:26] is
[48:28] isn't that wonderful
[48:30] in the things that we don't know how to
[48:32] explain we have instant access to him
[48:38] not that the answer is going to come
[48:40] right away but to think about it you're
[48:42] not going through and making a call and
[48:44] saying i've got to find out about this
[48:46] and shhh sends you offshore to india and
[48:49] you're getting a call over that no you
[48:51] have direct connection
[48:57] direct connection by relationship with
[49:00] him i am the way the truth and the life
[49:02] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[49:05] if ye had known me you should have known
[49:07] my father also and from henceforth ye
[49:10] know him and have seen him
[49:13] philip said unto him lord show us the
[49:16] father
[49:17] and it sufficeth us
[49:20] jesus said unto him how have i been so
[49:22] long time with you and yet hast thou not
[49:26] known me philip he that hath seen me
[49:30] hath seen the father how sayest thou
[49:32] then show us the father believeth thou
[49:35] not that i am in the father and the
[49:37] father in me
[49:38] the words that i speak unto you i speak
[49:41] not of myself
[49:43] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[49:46] doeth the works
[49:50] believe me that i am in the father and
[49:53] the father in me
[49:55] or else believe me
[49:58] for the very work's sake
[50:02] so jesus is letting it he's declaring
[50:06] it's not
[50:08] me
[50:09] that is doing this
[50:11] it is my father that dwelleth in me
[50:15] he's the one if you if you can't believe
[50:19] or grasp my words
[50:22] believe the works that you see to know
[50:25] that this is something that is greater
[50:29] than just human instrumentality
[50:33] so you know it's just like
[50:35] uh i think it was brother royale when he
[50:37] stood there when he first started the
[50:38] mystery expos and he went into was it a
[50:41] lutheran church at first they went into
[50:43] so they go in and one of the things that
[50:45] was spoken that they spoke to brother
[50:47] roell eventually here it just comes to
[50:49] me and they said we have been taught in
[50:52] seminary to debate your doctrines
[50:56] but they said one thing that we cannot
[50:58] debate and that's the life
[51:04] you can't debate the life
[51:09] you can try to you know just like when
[51:11] they want to try to come against this
[51:12] message you can't deny
[51:15] vindication from almighty god
[51:19] you can try to tear down the vessel you
[51:21] can try to do all those things but but i
[51:24] tell you that doesn't leave a very good
[51:26] outlook for you
[51:29] god vindicated his message
[51:34] and god vindicates it by his life and
[51:37] remember this is why over and over
[51:39] remember they would tell brother branham
[51:41] and they would say to him you don't have
[51:42] very good grammar oh boy you know this
[51:45] and that and so forth and brother brad
[51:47] said i may not know the book too well
[51:50] brother branham was not
[51:51] promoting not reading the word but he's
[51:54] letting it be known he says i don't know
[51:56] the maybe he said i don't know the book
[51:58] real well but he said i know the author
[52:02] and that's what's most important
[52:06] it's not getting us to
[52:08] an understanding
[52:10] of and please understand what i'm going
[52:12] to say it's not an understanding of the
[52:14] doctrines
[52:16] but you've got to meet jesus christ
[52:20] because when you meet him he's the one
[52:22] who breaks the bread to you personally
[52:25] he's the one who takes the word as it's
[52:28] coming in and as an inside teacher
[52:30] he's the one that alert and now there's
[52:33] been a quickening and alerting and
[52:35] you're beginning to hear his voice and
[52:37] remember that holy spirit begins to warm
[52:40] that seed on the inside
[52:43] nothing else will do that he's the one
[52:46] that begins to draw it out in quickening
[52:49] and bringing about a growth and a
[52:51] transformation in your life
[52:53] is that right
[52:55] and now let me just say this very
[52:56] clearly you can't know
[52:59] the lord jesus christ in a personal
[53:01] relationship if you remove the message
[53:04] of the hour
[53:06] because the message of the hour is the
[53:09] unfolding of jesus christ for who he
[53:12] really is down into the church of the
[53:15] living god
[53:17] that's what the stars are in the right
[53:19] hand is to reveal bypass seminaries
[53:23] bypass man's ideas bypass everything and
[53:27] to reveal his presence down into the
[53:30] church
[53:31] aren't you glad for that
[53:33] god has reserved those channels to
[53:37] reveal his presence to reveal his glory
[53:40] to reveal his person to reveal himself
[53:43] so we are not under the ideas of man
[53:49] and we're not saying that critically but
[53:52] we're saying it because it's life in
[53:54] this hour we there is a call let me say
[53:58] this to you there's a call in this hour
[54:00] i know there's not many christian
[54:02] bookstores left but you could go through
[54:04] i've been through them i've been through
[54:05] big ones their second few floors and on
[54:08] and on and on and you can look at the
[54:09] amount of books that are in there that
[54:12] deal with leadership
[54:14] you know why there's a cry for
[54:16] leadership
[54:19] and how that the spirit of god in this
[54:21] hour that he who is the way the truth
[54:25] and the life has come down to lead the
[54:28] church of the living god and i'm not
[54:30] just talking about out here in front but
[54:33] i'm talking about to bring the
[54:34] leadership so that it goes beyond the
[54:37] carnal mind it goes beyond the flesh
[54:40] goes beyond the baptism in the spirit
[54:42] and it goes to the quickening of the
[54:44] soul because leadership is not something
[54:47] in our flesh it's not in our spirit
[54:49] leadership is that on the inside of our
[54:53] lives when the spirit of truth is come
[54:56] he will lead and guide you
[54:59] into
[55:01] all truth
[55:02] so if the spirit you have cannot agree
[55:06] even with one truth you better check the
[55:09] spirit you have
[55:11] are you hearing me now
[55:13] because the word the bible said the holy
[55:15] ghost comes he said it's given in my
[55:18] name
[55:20] and i just say it in this way we're
[55:22] living in a moment at a time where there
[55:24] is no other clarity
[55:27] no other clarity anywhere else
[55:30] in the outside
[55:32] of the message of the hour
[55:35] and when i'm saying that of the message
[55:36] of the hour i am speaking of jesus
[55:40] christ
[55:41] because that's who this message is
[55:44] that's who this message come to reveal
[55:46] god did not hand it to a man and ask a
[55:50] man to clutter it up in seminary
[55:53] god had to have a vessel not even having
[55:56] a seventh grade education that would be
[55:58] able not to declare his own self but to
[56:02] declare jesus christ in this hour
[56:05] we have not been introduced to a man we
[56:08] have been introduced to jesus christ
[56:12] that's why when we read the bible we're
[56:14] not looking back and reading history
[56:16] where we can talk about a man who walked
[56:18] up and down the shores of galilee and
[56:20] one who wrote in the old fish you know
[56:22] we're created he's still the same god
[56:26] and he never
[56:29] hallelujah died
[56:29] paid the price and that same quickening
[56:32] power rose back up on that easter
[56:34] morning and he took that body and
[56:36] ascended on high and the holy spirit has
[56:39] come right back down into the church of
[56:41] the living god to continue what was done
[56:45] in the body of jesus now in the body of
[56:49] the bride
[56:50] [Applause]
[56:52] so his purpose
[56:54] was to show the
[56:56] father our purpose
[57:00] is to show the father
[57:05] hallelujah so i want to speak here just
[57:08] for
[57:09] a few moments
[57:11] on godly leadership
[57:13] that cultivates
[57:15] godliness
[57:17] godly leadership because to remember
[57:19] there's a lot of leadership a lot of
[57:21] voices vying for to lead us
[57:25] pop-up ads and everything else but godly
[57:28] leadership
[57:30] that cultivates
[57:32] godliness
[57:34] now in in genesis 18 verse 17
[57:38] the bible said and the lord said
[57:42] shall i hide from abraham that thing
[57:45] which i do now here's the revealing of
[57:48] the son of man here is here is abraham
[57:52] has now received a visitation once again
[57:56] remember he met melchizedek same god
[58:00] now
[58:01] here he's abraham receives a visitation
[58:05] here god has stepped down with two
[58:07] angels
[58:10] and abraham being in the presence of god
[58:13] abraham recognizes there's something
[58:16] spiritual about this man
[58:20] now here's what he does this is the
[58:21] thing abraham doesn't know all that's
[58:24] going on but you see he's had enough
[58:27] experiences with god
[58:29] and he is of god
[58:31] he is a friend of god
[58:34] that now when that comes there now
[58:36] abraham look what in we're not going to
[58:38] read those verses but i want you to
[58:40] notice what abraham does he
[58:43] entertains
[58:45] elohim
[58:48] he entertains and remember
[58:50] entertaining elohim here here stands the
[58:53] living god el shaddai
[58:56] veiled in a flesh veil
[59:00] are you with me yes
[59:02] sodom didn't receive that visitation
[59:08] can i say it in this way
[59:10] it would not have had the effect on
[59:12] sodom
[59:14] yes sir
[59:15] god god is not under a perhaps or a
[59:18] maybe this word when god sends his word
[59:21] to you it's not a mistake
[59:25] you haven't got somebody else's mail in
[59:28] your mailbox god has sent this message
[59:31] to you
[59:34] you might try to run from it you might
[59:36] try to put all the sorts of excuse but
[59:37] you can't run away from the
[59:40] foreknowledge of god
[59:43] the prodigal son went about his own way
[59:45] he thought he could find satisfaction
[59:47] out there but let me tell you something
[59:49] that didn't disturb god one bit because
[59:51] god's purpose can never be defeated
[59:55] [Applause]
[59:58] hallelujah but here's what abraham did
[1:00:02] he entertained
[1:00:04] elohim
[1:00:07] you see when he comes in these services
[1:00:09] it's important that you entertain him
[1:00:13] it's important that even after the
[1:00:15] service is over you entertain him
[1:00:19] make him feel welcome
[1:00:21] invite the word just allowing the word
[1:00:23] just opening up of your life it's
[1:00:25] important because if we do not entertain
[1:00:28] him the holy spirit will just he'll
[1:00:31] he'll leave as quick as he comes
[1:00:35] you understand what i'm saying
[1:00:38] i'm not talking about working you up
[1:00:40] into something i'm saying sometimes that
[1:00:42] where we're at listen as it was in the
[1:00:45] days of lot so shall it be in the coming
[1:00:47] of the son of man
[1:00:49] we're living in times of we can say
[1:00:51] busyness so this is busy and i've got
[1:00:52] this and and look i tell you what
[1:00:54] sometimes you look and film you're
[1:00:56] wondering as far as how we're timing
[1:00:58] where things fit in we're trying to fit
[1:01:00] things in let me just say it in this way
[1:01:02] this is where we have to have a real
[1:01:04] heart to heart with ourselves
[1:01:07] and say let's let's really evaluate this
[1:01:10] here am i really entertaining elohim
[1:01:15] because when you entertain him then the
[1:01:17] scripture is fulfilled of second
[1:01:19] corinthians 3 that in the presence of
[1:01:22] god
[1:01:23] we are changed from glory unto glory
[1:01:26] even as by the presence of the lord
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:31] right
[1:01:32] that's why let me say this spiritual
[1:01:34] growth is not dependent exclusively upon
[1:01:38] the pastor
[1:01:41] are you hearing me i don't i don't pour
[1:01:42] out miracle grow or any other minister
[1:01:45] they don't pour it on me when they're
[1:01:47] ministering but you see what the word
[1:01:48] does the word comes that we might
[1:01:50] entertain his presence and pray over
[1:01:53] what we're hearing if you look at it
[1:01:56] you'll begin to see you begin to see a
[1:01:57] part and i'm sure
[1:01:59] we could witness this you'll begin to
[1:02:00] see the messages you've listened to here
[1:02:03] and things you've been reading the bible
[1:02:04] you're like all of a sudden as the words
[1:02:06] being minister you're like i just read
[1:02:07] that or or something was said maybe not
[1:02:10] verbatim but it connects with something
[1:02:11] else you're hearing you say brother
[1:02:12] samuel what is that that's being in
[1:02:15] fellowship and entertaining elohim
[1:02:18] you'll recognizing him and continue to
[1:02:21] allow him to so saturate your life
[1:02:26] because he is the way for everything
[1:02:29] everything
[1:02:32] shall i hide from abraham that thing
[1:02:34] which i do seeing that abraham
[1:02:38] shall surely become a great and mighty
[1:02:40] nation and all the nations of the earth
[1:02:43] shall be blessed in him what a
[1:02:46] responsibility
[1:02:49] for i know him o glory
[1:02:52] that he will
[1:02:53] command his children and his household
[1:02:56] after him
[1:02:57] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[1:03:00] to do justice and judgment that the lord
[1:03:04] may bring upon abraham that which he
[1:03:07] hath spoken of him
[1:03:09] let me just say this
[1:03:11] god
[1:03:12] is not resting
[1:03:14] his plan and purpose upon the shoulders
[1:03:19] of flesh
[1:03:23] god's plan and purpose it rests only
[1:03:26] upon his word
[1:03:30] note in this here god is letting it be
[1:03:32] known
[1:03:34] how can you know god's standing there
[1:03:36] and saying i know him what does god know
[1:03:38] god knows the dna god knows the gene god
[1:03:42] knows that abram is of him and god knows
[1:03:46] that what god knows is that though words
[1:03:49] itself and the enemy can come in and try
[1:03:52] to work on words but god knows the
[1:03:54] revelation that has come and the
[1:03:57] presence of god can never be defeated
[1:04:02] are you hearing me
[1:04:04] satan could come against that of the
[1:04:06] prodigal son he can war against words
[1:04:09] but there's one thing he couldn't get
[1:04:11] out of that prodigal son and that's the
[1:04:13] presence of the father he knew back home
[1:04:22] hallelujah hallelujah this is why it
[1:04:25] becomes surreal when the message of the
[1:04:28] hour when the presence of god comes
[1:04:30] across your pathway and god begins to
[1:04:33] deal with our heart and as you're
[1:04:34] sitting there longing wondering why you
[1:04:36] can never fit in here fit in there and
[1:04:39] while there was never a settling is
[1:04:40] because you were ordained to dwell in
[1:04:44] jesus christ and when the presence of
[1:04:47] god begins to break over your life there
[1:04:49] begins to be an unfolding of the reality
[1:04:52] that i was there i am one of those
[1:04:55] morning stars that shouted for glory
[1:04:57] before the foundation of the world
[1:04:59] because right now i am delighted in the
[1:05:02] salvation of the lord that god has come
[1:05:05] he has set me free he is working in my
[1:05:08] life he has brought a deliverance in my
[1:05:11] life and i belong to him
[1:05:15] so with abraham i know him that he will
[1:05:18] command his children and his household
[1:05:19] after him and they shall keep the way of
[1:05:21] the lord remember the way of the lord is
[1:05:24] not just a teaching
[1:05:27] it's the person
[1:05:29] it's the person of jesus christ the
[1:05:30] presence of the lord now you think of it
[1:05:33] in this way the lord god revealing
[1:05:35] himself to abraham it would be brought
[1:05:38] forth responsibility and purpose if you
[1:05:40] remove the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:05:43] from abraham's life he's like any other
[1:05:45] man
[1:05:49] shifting
[1:05:50] by his own ideas
[1:05:52] leaning to his own understanding
[1:05:55] move from here
[1:05:56] move to there
[1:05:58] this one day is an absolute
[1:06:00] years change now this is an absolute
[1:06:03] we're living in a day like that where
[1:06:05] there used to be an absolute that god
[1:06:08] created male and female
[1:06:11] now over time what's happened now
[1:06:13] people's absolute that one time could
[1:06:16] hold to that now it's changed
[1:06:19] you know what it showed that was a false
[1:06:21] that was a false absolute in their life
[1:06:24] not that that was wrong you understand
[1:06:26] me now not that that was wrong but that
[1:06:29] it wasn't embedded in their life the way
[1:06:32] it needed to be
[1:06:34] because the real absolute is that of
[1:06:36] christ being in our life
[1:06:39] so not that of male and fe that is a
[1:06:42] true absolute and god regard restores
[1:06:45] that god makes that known by his
[1:06:47] presence but so it's we're not lifted
[1:06:49] we're not left to shift for ourselves
[1:06:53] aren't you glad for that
[1:06:55] i'm glad for clear direction and
[1:06:58] leadership in this hour
[1:07:00] i'm grateful for a godly leadership that
[1:07:02] cultivates godliness
[1:07:05] you see the voice it was the same voice
[1:07:08] that spoke to abraham and let abraham
[1:07:10] know
[1:07:11] that you are a hebrew meaning one who is
[1:07:14] from beyond
[1:07:17] god's the one that revealed that to
[1:07:18] abraham and abraham's life
[1:07:22] testified he was a hebrew there had
[1:07:24] never been a word brother random
[1:07:26] identifies because we can see he came
[1:07:27] out of the earth how d that abraham was
[1:07:29] a gentile
[1:07:31] right
[1:07:32] but hebrew is one from beyond
[1:07:36] and abraham never called himself that
[1:07:38] but when lot was in trouble
[1:07:41] they said go find abram one who is from
[1:07:44] beyond
[1:07:45] one who has a source of strength and
[1:07:48] power and dominion above this world
[1:07:52] glory be to god in the highest oh my
[1:07:55] it's that same voice that comes and
[1:07:57] confirms to our hearts so abraham with a
[1:07:59] personal revelation in his life of the
[1:08:02] presence of the lord he was setting
[1:08:04] forth the ways of the lord now i want
[1:08:07] you to think of this very clearly we can
[1:08:10] look and see
[1:08:12] christ in abraham's life is that right
[1:08:15] we know how the prophet would lay it so
[1:08:17] clearly in christ uh the mystery of god
[1:08:20] revealed he would say if you read the
[1:08:21] bible and you don't see christ in every
[1:08:23] verse go back and read it again because
[1:08:26] you've missed it
[1:08:27] because this is the this this bible
[1:08:31] is is that
[1:08:32] burden
[1:08:34] and desire and expression of one goal
[1:08:37] that god has had
[1:08:39] and that is that god might be one
[1:08:43] with his children
[1:08:45] then if all of his attributes
[1:08:48] all that he was
[1:08:49] would be expressed think of this his
[1:08:52] expression of his attributes are not are
[1:08:55] not only uh uh times of you know of
[1:08:59] salvation that's an attribute but he's
[1:09:01] also a healer
[1:09:03] times when we need healing whether in a
[1:09:05] physical body
[1:09:07] or our spirit he's a healer
[1:09:10] in other words there's not a situation
[1:09:13] or a need that can arise in your life
[1:09:16] that he doesn't already have the answer
[1:09:20] for
[1:09:21] and he is the answer
[1:09:23] he doesn't call us in a prescription and
[1:09:25] say go pick it up
[1:09:28] he says i am your medicine
[1:09:31] i am i am i am i am i am
[1:09:35] we can look and see christ in abraham's
[1:09:37] life in other words
[1:09:39] faith
[1:09:40] was visible
[1:09:42] christ was displayed let us break in
[1:09:44] here in genesis 22 verse 7
[1:09:46] and isaac spake unto abraham
[1:09:50] his father now here is isaac and abraham
[1:09:53] going up remember god has called abraham
[1:09:57] and spoke to him offer up thine only
[1:10:00] son
[1:10:02] and isaac speaks to his father and says
[1:10:06] my father and he said here i am my son
[1:10:08] and he said behold the fire and the wood
[1:10:11] but where is the lamb for a burnt
[1:10:13] offering now i want you just to zero in
[1:10:15] on this
[1:10:17] what do you see here
[1:10:19] first of all you see
[1:10:21] that there is an understanding we can't
[1:10:24] worship without a sacrifice
[1:10:28] now right here he's 16 17 18 years old
[1:10:33] may i say it in this way teeny bopper
[1:10:35] yours
[1:10:36] teenager years
[1:10:38] right
[1:10:40] but notice where this is at my father
[1:10:44] so not only does he have an
[1:10:46] understanding
[1:10:47] that worship
[1:10:49] requires a sacrifice
[1:10:53] he's there's an understanding the way of
[1:10:56] the lord
[1:10:57] has has been expressed but it's not just
[1:11:00] something that's been expressed he's
[1:11:02] aware of what's going on he's not asking
[1:11:04] what's this wood about what's this fire
[1:11:06] about what's this about so isaac is
[1:11:09] moving in a way he understands these
[1:11:12] parts so there's an understanding about
[1:11:14] his life you say brother samuel well
[1:11:16] yeah we understand that but no do we
[1:11:18] really understand that that worship is a
[1:11:21] sacrifice
[1:11:23] we worship through the sacrificial
[1:11:25] offering of the lord jesus christ and as
[1:11:29] our life has become a sacrifice
[1:11:32] we must become a sacrifice and when our
[1:11:35] lives have become a sacrifice then
[1:11:37] christ moves on the inside and then
[1:11:39] through our lives
[1:11:42] it's a continual sacrifice is it not
[1:11:45] so it's letting it be known here we
[1:11:48] worship by sacrifice
[1:11:51] oh glory we you know
[1:11:53] it's a training hey son you know not
[1:11:55] everybody's going to think like you do
[1:11:57] as far as maybe you're not going to
[1:11:58] agree with this brother so-and-so and
[1:12:00] sister so and so or or this or that or
[1:12:03] somebody might step on your toes but
[1:12:04] understand to worship requires a
[1:12:07] sacrifice and that can even be your
[1:12:09] feelings your ideas your thoughts
[1:12:13] your opinions
[1:12:16] hallelujah
[1:12:18] so these are things
[1:12:20] that he understands the other part there
[1:12:22] is relationship here
[1:12:24] relationship between a father and his
[1:12:27] son
[1:12:29] see we see christ being depicted here is
[1:12:31] that right packing the wood up the hill
[1:12:33] packing it up to calvary that portrayed
[1:12:35] there but but his relationship because
[1:12:37] remember
[1:12:38] what what god was in christ it restoring
[1:12:42] that relationship that was lost in the
[1:12:45] fall
[1:12:47] and that was a relationship where god
[1:12:50] was back in man
[1:12:53] in other words
[1:12:54] the favor oh my if i can say it and just
[1:12:57] kind of pull back into a gear that in
[1:12:59] the manner that isaac had had that that
[1:13:02] abraham had even the favor of isaac
[1:13:06] isaac did not say you peg you packed the
[1:13:08] wood i don't feel like it
[1:13:11] you know i work at mcdonald's now
[1:13:13] you know i work two hours a day you pack
[1:13:15] the wood
[1:13:18] you know
[1:13:21] you know i mean i take out the trash i
[1:13:23] take out the treasure mcdonald's
[1:13:28] i'm being you see i'm going somewhere
[1:13:30] not even in this service altogether but
[1:13:32] i'm getting somewhere with this
[1:13:35] the word is comes to be very practical
[1:13:39] in our life
[1:13:41] are you with me and not just left out
[1:13:43] here the revelation continues to unfold
[1:13:45] just as much as that revelation is
[1:13:47] opening like that of a roman candle
[1:13:49] within it the opening doesn't make it
[1:13:51] more obscure wow
[1:13:54] wow no it brings it when it opens it
[1:13:56] unfolds itself down into our lives in a
[1:14:00] practical manner
[1:14:03] is that right that's why brother branham
[1:14:05] could stand in the church age book and
[1:14:07] speak of how that christ could could
[1:14:09] deal with uh encouraging the right and
[1:14:13] discouraging the wrong and brother
[1:14:14] braham said we could all learn a lesson
[1:14:16] here for running our churches our homes
[1:14:18] and our families
[1:14:21] so no there's relationship and there's
[1:14:24] respect
[1:14:27] respect
[1:14:31] my pops
[1:14:33] my father
[1:14:35] oh brother samuel that's old school no
[1:14:36] no i'm talking bible
[1:14:40] don't use society's language on me
[1:14:43] don't try to use sodom's perversion on
[1:14:45] me
[1:14:47] i'm talking bible language
[1:14:50] somebody's got to stand in this hour
[1:14:55] i'm just going to be very frank with you
[1:14:57] i think it's one of the most
[1:14:58] disrespectful things to hear a young man
[1:15:00] or a young lady call their mom or dad by
[1:15:03] their own name
[1:15:07] god gave you that father and that mother
[1:15:09] and you address them with with respect
[1:15:12] that's a promise in the bible children
[1:15:14] obey your parents in the lord for that
[1:15:17] is the first commandment with promise of
[1:15:19] life
[1:15:21] because if you can't honor father and
[1:15:23] mother then who you're going to honor
[1:15:25] how can you honor god you can't honor
[1:15:26] god correctly
[1:15:29] are you hearing me
[1:15:31] that's why we look at relationships
[1:15:33] we'll get relationships when i tell that
[1:15:35] of young people look at relationships in
[1:15:36] the family look at relationships how
[1:15:38] they are because those relationships all
[1:15:40] of a sudden things just don't all of a
[1:15:41] sudden change and all of a sudden now
[1:15:43] this is a perfect relationship i do
[1:15:46] believe and we all believe that there is
[1:15:48] a paradox of the new birth don't we
[1:15:50] so let's not let's not put that aside
[1:15:52] but i i believe that there are things to
[1:15:55] be able to look at with relationship and
[1:15:57] respect and notice abraham said
[1:16:01] my son
[1:16:02] god will provide himself a lamb for a
[1:16:06] burnt offering so they went both of them
[1:16:09] together
[1:16:10] my what a journey
[1:16:12] abraham is trusting his father
[1:16:16] are you hearing me
[1:16:18] so in other words
[1:16:20] even in this right here
[1:16:22] it is another part of it
[1:16:24] that isaac has been
[1:16:27] not just taught
[1:16:28] not just instructed
[1:16:30] not just a picture on the wall with the
[1:16:32] pillar of fire but
[1:16:34] isaac has been instructed
[1:16:37] the supernatural is in our home
[1:16:40] the supernatural is present
[1:16:44] god is not far off
[1:16:45] god is present
[1:16:48] and to recognize how many times you
[1:16:49] think that isaac was was told in his
[1:16:52] life isaac
[1:16:54] you're a product
[1:16:56] of the supernatural
[1:16:58] now it doesn't bypass that you've got to
[1:17:00] have your own experience isaac but i
[1:17:02] want you to know that your life is a
[1:17:05] product of the supernatural
[1:17:10] so it's these things are are present
[1:17:12] within that of the home now let's go to
[1:17:15] deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 7 and
[1:17:17] looking at this responsibility my
[1:17:21] for what nation notice as god is
[1:17:23] speaking here to israel for what nation
[1:17:26] is there so great
[1:17:28] who hath god
[1:17:30] so nigh unto them as the lord our god is
[1:17:33] in all things that we call upon him for
[1:17:37] i say thank you lord
[1:17:39] i'm so glad about that aren't you
[1:17:42] moses making them aware who that god is
[1:17:45] so knight to us of all the things that
[1:17:47] we're calling on him for
[1:17:50] and what nation verse eight is there so
[1:17:52] great that has statutes and judgments so
[1:17:54] righteous as all this law which i set
[1:17:58] before you
[1:17:59] this day
[1:18:01] only take heed to thyself and keep thy
[1:18:04] soul diligently lest thou forget the
[1:18:06] things which thine eyes have seen
[1:18:09] unless they depart from thy heart all
[1:18:11] the days of thy life but teach them thy
[1:18:15] sons and thy son's sons
[1:18:19] see a purpose that goes it's ongoing
[1:18:22] not just in
[1:18:24] that that of our immediate family
[1:18:27] those of you that are grandparents
[1:18:30] those of us if god terrors that will be
[1:18:32] grandparents
[1:18:34] this there is there is a responsibility
[1:18:39] that we have before us
[1:18:42] teach them thy sons and thy sons now
[1:18:44] notice
[1:18:45] how
[1:18:46] moses
[1:18:48] directs their focus
[1:18:50] and he wants this right here is that's
[1:18:52] very important verse 10 especially the
[1:18:56] day that thou stood us before the lord
[1:18:58] thy god
[1:18:59] in horeb when the lord said unto me
[1:19:02] gather me the people together and i will
[1:19:04] make them hear my words that they may
[1:19:06] learn to fear me all the days that they
[1:19:08] shall live upon the earth that they may
[1:19:11] teach their children
[1:19:14] so
[1:19:16] the presence of god
[1:19:19] that
[1:19:20] for all of the teaching that is to be
[1:19:23] done it's not just we do this and we
[1:19:26] don't do that we there needs to be that
[1:19:28] instruction in righteousness
[1:19:30] can you say amen to that
[1:19:32] there needs to be that in other words
[1:19:35] god is letting him know
[1:19:37] you've been in the presence of god and
[1:19:39] that is what you're to be moved by
[1:19:42] motivated by that's what all teaching is
[1:19:44] based on is your relationship with
[1:19:47] almighty
[1:19:49] that there's something beyond words
[1:19:51] that's being communicated
[1:19:53] it's the presence of god i i just
[1:19:56] believe this with all my heart there's
[1:19:58] more scriptures i could read upon this
[1:20:00] but i believe with all of my heart that
[1:20:03] god's desire is as that same glory that
[1:20:07] was revealed and moses would come down
[1:20:10] and that glory with this countenance
[1:20:12] would shine that that same glory would
[1:20:15] descend upon the father that glory would
[1:20:18] descend upon the mother that glory would
[1:20:20] descend upon the children in other words
[1:20:23] the glory did not stay back in a
[1:20:26] visitation of a supernatural cloud but
[1:20:29] what took place there has come all the
[1:20:31] way down into the home
[1:20:35] and he can't get there without channels
[1:20:40] so it's not by chance that here we are
[1:20:42] standing in this moment but the glory of
[1:20:46] god has come upon us
[1:20:49] and with that glory is a responsibility
[1:20:52] and the responsibility is is for us to
[1:20:55] get out of the way for us to yield our
[1:20:57] lives to god and for us to be
[1:21:00] purposeful
[1:21:02] in the things that we do may i say it in
[1:21:04] this way bringing our children to church
[1:21:07] is not enough
[1:21:09] it's important but it's not enough
[1:21:13] it must be descended into the home
[1:21:17] the glory was meant to be descended in
[1:21:19] the home just as much as this glory was
[1:21:22] to be descended there when you go even
[1:21:25] into the workplace it is the glory of
[1:21:27] god that you're veiling in your life you
[1:21:29] know i'm not way out somewhere i'm
[1:21:31] preaching right in the scriptures here
[1:21:33] we're talking about the glory of god
[1:21:35] what was there where that when moses was
[1:21:38] veiled that eventually was to move
[1:21:41] behind badger skins and it would be the
[1:21:44] same glory
[1:21:46] and that same glory is what comes to you
[1:21:49] and i what is the glory of the lord
[1:21:52] it is the revealing of his presence
[1:21:56] the revealing of his person
[1:22:01] so he is like
[1:22:03] that precious ointment that we spoke of
[1:22:06] last week that moves down remember
[1:22:10] this is why brother branham would take
[1:22:12] in what house will you build me
[1:22:14] how many of you listen to that message
[1:22:15] what house will you build me
[1:22:17] okay about five of you
[1:22:19] okay what house will you build me
[1:22:21] my 30th 30 30 some minutes
[1:22:25] brother brown was not only dealing with
[1:22:27] where the message is at
[1:22:30] he's dealing with the local assembly
[1:22:32] he's dealing with homes and
[1:22:34] responsibilities because what he's
[1:22:36] seeing is he's seeing kids out on sunday
[1:22:38] riding on bicycles and it's burdened him
[1:22:40] to such a place that he's asked god lord
[1:22:43] that there be a place that the people
[1:22:45] can gather and actually hear the message
[1:22:50] it was a burden upon his heart i'm glad
[1:22:53] that god has answered that burden not
[1:22:55] just for there but i'm glad god answered
[1:22:57] it here aren't you
[1:22:59] i'm glad i have a place that i can i can
[1:23:01] go and and and hear the word of the lord
[1:23:04] and the presence of god moves down
[1:23:07] in our lives i'm very grateful for that
[1:23:12] so
[1:23:13] the message and brother bran would make
[1:23:16] this statement he says the message of
[1:23:17] the hour
[1:23:19] is not just to be
[1:23:21] the light
[1:23:23] and the flame of the world
[1:23:26] it's to be the flame in our
[1:23:29] hearts
[1:23:30] or we
[1:23:32] can't rightly present it
[1:23:35] so the message is not a doctrine
[1:23:39] the message is not a teaching
[1:23:42] the message
[1:23:44] is the person of jesus christ revealed
[1:23:48] to where you and him he and i will
[1:23:52] become one
[1:23:54] is that right
[1:23:56] so now thinking of with abraham where
[1:23:59] brother brahma is drawing this from and
[1:24:00] i just want to read a few places here
[1:24:03] and brother branham makes this statement
[1:24:05] he says in the hebrew series he says
[1:24:07] your attitude towards christ will make a
[1:24:10] great impression on what your children
[1:24:12] will be now notice
[1:24:14] not our teaching that's important
[1:24:16] i'm not going there today
[1:24:18] but our attitude
[1:24:20] toward christ
[1:24:24] that makes an impression think what
[1:24:26] would think when abraham came into back
[1:24:28] into his home in abraham's home he
[1:24:32] had received an impression from god
[1:24:38] that impression upon his life that
[1:24:40] changed his life because remember
[1:24:43] the bible says in
[1:24:45] hebrews 11
[1:24:46] that that that by faith sarah
[1:24:49] receives strength to conceive
[1:24:52] and you realize in the message believing
[1:24:54] god brother braham said i've never he
[1:24:56] says believed it was sarah's faith that
[1:24:59] created the miracle it was abraham's
[1:25:01] faith you say that's contradictory to
[1:25:03] scripture no it's not because the faith
[1:25:06] that you and i have we have our own
[1:25:07] individual faith is that right
[1:25:10] but the holy ghost is the faith of
[1:25:12] almighty god
[1:25:15] so it was the faith of elohim the faith
[1:25:18] of el shaddai that was moving in godly
[1:25:21] leadership into that of the home so
[1:25:24] abraham was only a channel that god
[1:25:27] could move through
[1:25:28] abraham could not change sarahs listen
[1:25:31] even as abraham was standing there in
[1:25:33] the home abraham could not change her
[1:25:36] thinking about herself but when abraham
[1:25:39] being there it invited elohim to come
[1:25:42] down and do what he could not do
[1:25:45] abraham said it's real to me it's
[1:25:48] personal to me but god i need you and
[1:25:50] let me say this lord that welcome mat
[1:25:53] out there of my tent is not for sodom
[1:25:57] that welcome matt is for your presence
[1:26:03] glory be to god in the highest
[1:26:05] hallelujah your attitude towards christ
[1:26:09] will make a great impression on what
[1:26:11] your children will be
[1:26:12] that's a powerful statement
[1:26:15] our attitude towards christ makes that
[1:26:17] impression your life that you live
[1:26:20] before your family
[1:26:22] will make an impression
[1:26:24] on what your children will be
[1:26:27] now no way is brother rand talking that
[1:26:29] that where everything that we do is
[1:26:32] perfect
[1:26:33] that you know when you go to your home
[1:26:36] my goodness you know the the angels just
[1:26:38] gather there and you know they're there
[1:26:40] you eat donuts with angels every morning
[1:26:43] and you know and you that's not what
[1:26:45] he's saying
[1:26:47] because a real christian life it is not
[1:26:50] and i'm not demeaning anything here but
[1:26:52] a real christian life is not about
[1:26:56] perfection in ourselves it's a love
[1:26:59] affair with jesus christ
[1:27:02] and let me say this we can fool a lot of
[1:27:04] people a lot of times but you can't fool
[1:27:08] everybody all the time
[1:27:11] whatever you love is gonna come out
[1:27:16] you can't hide it it will come out in
[1:27:18] your life
[1:27:21] and that's why it cannot be i who liveth
[1:27:25] it's got to be christ because he is the
[1:27:28] way the truth and the
[1:27:30] life your life that you live before your
[1:27:33] family and make an impression on what
[1:27:36] your children will be
[1:27:41] because the bible said he would visit
[1:27:42] the iniquity of the parents upon the
[1:27:44] children to the third and fourth
[1:27:45] generation now if iniquity is visited
[1:27:48] and it is right
[1:27:50] is that right
[1:27:52] then righteousness is also visited
[1:27:57] i i don't know about you but i believe
[1:27:59] we feel the same way i want to be
[1:28:01] part of where righteousness can flow
[1:28:05] that's what i want to be i want to be
[1:28:07] just a part where as a channel that
[1:28:09] righteousness can flow because knowing
[1:28:11] we need elohim we need el shaddai moving
[1:28:14] down in our homes and we always want to
[1:28:16] be in a place that he's welcome
[1:28:18] well why it's coming to me i'm just
[1:28:20] going to go ahead and preach
[1:28:21] when elohim was on his way down the road
[1:28:24] remember in the tent that morning
[1:28:25] brother branham tells us it is anything
[1:28:27] too hard for the lord he said they had
[1:28:29] had a scuffle in the tent that morning
[1:28:32] oh my lord abraham and sarah had a
[1:28:35] scuffle or his brother john lafontaine
[1:28:37] said
[1:28:38] how did he say that
[1:28:41] heated discussion
[1:28:43] a heated fellowship that's what he used
[1:28:44] to say
[1:28:46] he did fellowship
[1:28:50] now think of that here god is coming
[1:28:53] down the way
[1:28:54] that didn't stop god but that evidently
[1:28:58] evidently had to be that of grace that
[1:29:01] was given somebody had to say forgive me
[1:29:04] i'm sorry
[1:29:06] because remember it didn't keep the
[1:29:08] presence of god away
[1:29:11] brother and sister let me tell you
[1:29:12] something repentance is powerful
[1:29:16] don't hold on to anything in your life
[1:29:18] don't make excuses for it repent when
[1:29:21] you know it's wrong because what that
[1:29:23] does is open a channel for el shaddai to
[1:29:26] come down
[1:29:29] oh glory be to god it'll make an
[1:29:32] impression an effect upon someone think
[1:29:34] of this effect in second timothy chapter
[1:29:36] 1 verse 5 when i call to remembrance
[1:29:39] paul speaking to timothy when i call and
[1:29:41] remembers the unfeigned faith that is in
[1:29:42] thee which dwelt first in thy
[1:29:45] grandmother lois and thy mother eunice
[1:29:47] and i am persuaded that in thee also
[1:29:54] paul
[1:29:55] is identifying this same faith that he
[1:29:58] saw now
[1:29:59] it wasn't just the faith
[1:30:02] of his grandmother uh lois
[1:30:05] and his mother eunice
[1:30:07] it was a faith that motivated their
[1:30:10] faith
[1:30:12] you understand what i'm saying
[1:30:14] in the church ages god commends one of
[1:30:17] the ages and says i have seen your faith
[1:30:19] and brother bram says notice god's not
[1:30:21] talking about his faith there he's
[1:30:23] talking about their faith
[1:30:25] you see we need our faith but we need
[1:30:28] our faith to be under the influence of
[1:30:31] his faith
[1:30:34] are you with me it lifts us from just uh
[1:30:36] having that of intellectual faith and
[1:30:38] and that faith within our life it lifts
[1:30:40] us in a godly faith we need that now
[1:30:44] what god was commending them was their
[1:30:45] actions their works and what was coming
[1:30:48] out of their life
[1:30:49] so now this faith i've seen it now let
[1:30:52] me just let me just skip over a part of
[1:30:54] that in that in that quote there are the
[1:30:56] message why brother brand picks it up
[1:30:57] again he says in that second paragraph
[1:30:59] your life will impress your children
[1:31:02] how many know the world is just dying to
[1:31:04] impress your children
[1:31:08] you know
[1:31:10] everybody that's fake on facebook
[1:31:17] now i'm not saying everybody's got
[1:31:18] facebook is fake because i know i'm
[1:31:21] speaking to an older congregation older
[1:31:23] generation you guys are the facebook
[1:31:25] people
[1:31:26] the younger ones are the snapchats
[1:31:32] see i had to kind of go in and study
[1:31:34] about this over weeks
[1:31:38] but everybody gets under pressure and
[1:31:39] trying to impress somebody
[1:31:42] they've got these influencers
[1:31:44] come on now
[1:31:46] amazon just two weeks ago had them out
[1:31:47] there in arizona paid them them people
[1:31:50] make they went influencing market went
[1:31:52] from 1.3 billion to 13.8 billion
[1:31:55] like that
[1:31:57] influencers
[1:31:59] some of the garbage they wear i wouldn't
[1:32:00] even put on my dog
[1:32:04] i mean the influence you see i
[1:32:06] understand what i'm trying to say
[1:32:08] everything is trying to come to bring an
[1:32:10] impression
[1:32:14] your life will impress your children
[1:32:16] have influenced your children by the
[1:32:18] example you set before them
[1:32:22] and i think it's a good thing that we
[1:32:24] put every effort did you see that every
[1:32:27] effort we can before our children as
[1:32:29] godly parents
[1:32:31] how many say help me lord
[1:32:33] because it takes sacrifice every effort
[1:32:35] there's things that we've got to
[1:32:37] override because we override if we don't
[1:32:40] they're only following our example
[1:32:45] they're only following that
[1:32:47] they have an image and that image is
[1:32:49] something that though the prophet is
[1:32:51] bringing it he's ministering it and they
[1:32:53] hear it ministered here but it's your
[1:32:55] life that has the greatest impact
[1:32:59] in other words it's your life that
[1:33:01] becomes the pictorial display of what
[1:33:03] the message is all about
[1:33:06] oh god help us to have the right kind of
[1:33:08] billboards
[1:33:09] right
[1:33:10] i don't want my life looking like one of
[1:33:11] these mcdonald hamburgers on the
[1:33:13] billboard and you get in there it looks
[1:33:14] like an elephant stomped on it it looks
[1:33:16] like lettuce nobody else even an
[1:33:17] earthworm wouldn't eat that lettuce
[1:33:20] well they might want to sue me now right
[1:33:22] i mean it don't even look right which we
[1:33:25] want a true representation because our
[1:33:27] lives are not just something that's a
[1:33:30] billboard it's a living example of jesus
[1:33:33] christ and let me tell you something
[1:33:35] he's the only one that can help our
[1:33:36] children he's the only one that can help
[1:33:38] our loved ones and we want for goodness
[1:33:40] sake we want to have the right influence
[1:33:43] that there's an impression of they'll
[1:33:45] shady i upon their lives
[1:33:48] it points them to jesus christ make an
[1:33:50] example be an example
[1:33:53] i don't think there's any greater
[1:33:55] example as godly parents than full
[1:33:57] obedience to the word of god
[1:34:00] there's a lot in this i'm not going to
[1:34:01] go down to try to bring everything and
[1:34:03] every little point down that'll come
[1:34:05] but notice
[1:34:06] everybody all right
[1:34:08] seat belts on
[1:34:10] okay i'm going to read something here
[1:34:11] now
[1:34:12] seat belts on out of the message elisha
[1:34:14] the prophet brother graham said how can
[1:34:16] you expect your children to go to sunday
[1:34:18] school and serve the lord when you
[1:34:19] yourself don't even go
[1:34:22] how can you expect your children to be
[1:34:24] something when you're nothing he said
[1:34:26] that's a little sassy but i don't mean
[1:34:28] it that way
[1:34:29] he said he had me to say it this is not
[1:34:31] premeditated i didn't mean you wasn't
[1:34:33] nothing but i mean when you know that
[1:34:36] you make no profession how can you
[1:34:39] expect your children to be righteous
[1:34:42] when you're putting such an example
[1:34:44] before them
[1:34:45] how can you do that
[1:34:48] you're the best example
[1:34:50] that they have
[1:34:53] i tell you
[1:34:55] if that
[1:34:57] ought to let it sink down to the fifth
[1:34:59] rib you don't have to be a theologian
[1:35:04] mama daddy
[1:35:06] god has not called you and ordered you
[1:35:09] that you have to be able to sit there
[1:35:10] and go write down the message and this
[1:35:12] quote and
[1:35:13] but god has ordained you
[1:35:15] to be a gospel that's living and in
[1:35:18] action
[1:35:20] faith is built in your life mama when
[1:35:22] something rises there in the home you
[1:35:23] say let's pray
[1:35:25] what's it doing it's a training that you
[1:35:27] know what something comes up let's pray
[1:35:29] let's talk to the lord about this
[1:35:31] let's go to god in prayer let's pray
[1:35:33] about this it's making known the way of
[1:35:36] the lord it's an example about this
[1:35:39] hallelujah
[1:35:41] so it's it's it's a right example you're
[1:35:44] the best example that they have they're
[1:35:46] going to look to you and they won't look
[1:35:48] for no one else is a big statement
[1:35:50] because your nature is in them
[1:35:52] and we can say in that well help them
[1:35:54] jesus
[1:35:57] oh i can see i can see me in my voice
[1:36:02] but sam you got browning dna browning
[1:36:04] dna and ain't no better than anybody
[1:36:05] else's dna
[1:36:08] sanchez dna whatever your last name is
[1:36:10] you can tack it on it ain't better than
[1:36:11] nobody else's dna
[1:36:13] scientists aren't hitting you up for a
[1:36:15] blood sample to try to replicate your
[1:36:17] dna you and i are still all of us are
[1:36:19] filled with junk and we need the grace
[1:36:21] of god the overcoming power to lift us
[1:36:25] in overcoming grace
[1:36:27] if there's anything good that's come out
[1:36:29] of our life it's because of the grace of
[1:36:32] god
[1:36:33] don't ever elevate a man
[1:36:39] your nature is in them so you know what
[1:36:41] that means as a priest you're able to
[1:36:43] understand them
[1:36:45] you're able to pray for them and
[1:36:46] intercede for them know how to minister
[1:36:48] to them know what reaches them even when
[1:36:51] it comes to discipline not what you
[1:36:53] think reaches them
[1:36:55] not going to go there
[1:36:58] no we don't want parenting.com magazines
[1:37:03] all right
[1:37:04] we don't want space space track theology
[1:37:08] come on friends we see what you know why
[1:37:10] all that is is because they got away
[1:37:12] from the word of god
[1:37:14] when you get away from the word you go
[1:37:17] into confusion
[1:37:21] your nature is in them so who better who
[1:37:23] better could help them hopefully you're
[1:37:25] a pastor but remember you understand
[1:37:27] them you know the struggles in your own
[1:37:29] life that you go through
[1:37:31] come on somebody
[1:37:33] that's why you're able to look as you're
[1:37:34] praying and working with them as as a
[1:37:37] priest that is there you understand
[1:37:39] their struggles
[1:37:42] that's how you're able to pray for them
[1:37:44] in a way of intercession because you
[1:37:46] know their makeup
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:49] [Laughter]
[1:37:51] i won't tell you which one but
[1:37:53] when i go to talk to my boys there's
[1:37:55] times that i can talk to them
[1:37:56] and and especially i can look and say as
[1:37:59] i'm talking and that grin breaks out
[1:38:01] across the face i said yeah i know
[1:38:04] you know how i know because you're like
[1:38:05] me
[1:38:08] [Laughter]
[1:38:10] and the same way that the holy ghost has
[1:38:11] given me grace he didn't rip it out of
[1:38:14] my life but he just sat down in the seat
[1:38:16] of authority
[1:38:22] god said like nehemiah i'm not changing
[1:38:23] the fish gate from the sheet gate
[1:38:25] through it no no no we're just going to
[1:38:26] put them under the right order
[1:38:28] we're going to put the locks and gates
[1:38:29] and bars we're going to set back down in
[1:38:31] our rightful position we've been brought
[1:38:33] out of babylon and we're setting back
[1:38:34] now in position of authority
[1:38:37] so your nature is in them
[1:38:39] able to to really to intercede and to
[1:38:41] minister on their behalf you remember
[1:38:43] when
[1:38:45] the
[1:38:46] they would apply the blood in the in in
[1:38:48] in in the home
[1:38:50] there in the passover
[1:38:52] and they would apply that blood i have
[1:38:53] the scripture but i'm not going to read
[1:38:55] it but they were to strike it so the
[1:38:57] blood taking the lamb
[1:39:00] killing the lamb
[1:39:01] and then applying the blood so the
[1:39:03] plying of the blood
[1:39:05] it went up on the doorpost and the
[1:39:07] lintel
[1:39:08] brother branham was so careful to point
[1:39:10] out to you and i in the message he said
[1:39:12] i want you to notice
[1:39:14] that the blood was not put
[1:39:17] on on that of the bottom
[1:39:19] it was put above
[1:39:21] because we're never to walk over the
[1:39:23] blood
[1:39:25] we're always to have the blood above us
[1:39:27] so that we're looking up to christ
[1:39:33] glory be to god
[1:39:34] he said brother samuel what does that
[1:39:35] mean so that in our life it's christ
[1:39:38] that's lifted in glory in power in our
[1:39:42] lives
[1:39:44] to where we're not treating the word of
[1:39:46] god as that's not necessary that's not
[1:39:48] important brother ram was a little bit
[1:39:50] too much this way oh that's brother
[1:39:51] samuel's thoughts that's brother
[1:39:52] samuel's thinking and that's what
[1:39:54] listen friends i would encourage you if
[1:39:56] you feel like that something is my
[1:39:59] thinking come sit down with me
[1:40:02] because i don't want to preach my
[1:40:03] thinking
[1:40:04] i don't want my thoughts going on here
[1:40:06] because my thoughts do not have life in
[1:40:08] them
[1:40:11] but it's to have christ exalted and it's
[1:40:13] not just
[1:40:14] it's not just and i just i'm going to
[1:40:16] say it very frankly it's not just enough
[1:40:18] to have the picture on the wall or to
[1:40:20] have it in a bookshelf but he's got to
[1:40:22] be exalted in our actions
[1:40:25] not just we associate around the message
[1:40:28] or we believe the message we believe the
[1:40:30] message no it's got to be that the
[1:40:32] message is flesh inside of us
[1:40:36] there's a fervency inside of our lives
[1:40:41] brother samuel that's old-fashioned
[1:40:43] that's old-fashioned religion
[1:40:46] let me tell you it was good for peter it
[1:40:48] was good for paul it was good for all of
[1:40:50] them a good old-fashioned baptism of the
[1:40:53] holy ghost
[1:40:56] you can't be set on fire and then sit
[1:40:58] still
[1:41:03] the fire of god is leadership that comes
[1:41:07] to lead you
[1:41:08] not just to come upon you
[1:41:10] and pull back off of you
[1:41:12] come upon you
[1:41:14] pull back off of you
[1:41:16] you don't want just a baptism of the
[1:41:17] holy ghost you want the person of jesus
[1:41:20] christ
[1:41:23] he is the way so it needs is to be
[1:41:25] exalted in other words our home
[1:41:29] is under the order and the leadership of
[1:41:31] the lamb of god
[1:41:33] he is our safety
[1:41:35] he is our life
[1:41:36] he's our shepherd he's our deliverer
[1:41:39] he's our healing he's our counselor he's
[1:41:41] our advocate he is our life everything
[1:41:45] every decision
[1:41:46] revolves around him
[1:41:50] the way our home i'm just speaking from
[1:41:52] my heart here
[1:41:54] the things that
[1:41:55] in our home
[1:41:57] where i have looked to set that order
[1:42:00] and from in this church
[1:42:02] is from the message of the hour and the
[1:42:04] bible
[1:42:07] are you hearing me
[1:42:08] not from so and so
[1:42:10] not from this
[1:42:12] i want it because there's safety
[1:42:15] in the lamb of god
[1:42:17] i don't want to see how close i can get
[1:42:19] to the world i don't want to reason with
[1:42:22] something
[1:42:25] i want to order that now let me just let
[1:42:27] me just say this brother samuel have you
[1:42:29] been perfect i've not been perfect
[1:42:31] but you can take every one of these and
[1:42:33] if you want to take them in the back
[1:42:34] room and you want to ask them and say
[1:42:36] has your daddy ever made mistakes and
[1:42:39] they can tell you yes
[1:42:41] and ask them when i've had to come to
[1:42:43] him and say
[1:42:44] forgive me
[1:42:46] i was wrong
[1:42:48] for either bringing this in or this
[1:42:50] being said
[1:42:51] because you know what i want them to
[1:42:53] know what's right
[1:42:55] i'm not interested in samuel browning
[1:42:57] being glorified in their eyes i want
[1:42:59] jesus christ
[1:43:02] to be set in their eyes
[1:43:05] so it's setting the right and this isn't
[1:43:07] this isn't deep things it isn't setting
[1:43:09] the writing remember it's not
[1:43:12] teaching in that of just word if you'll
[1:43:15] notice how the holy spirit has said this
[1:43:16] this morning the most important teaching
[1:43:19] and what makes them the words come back
[1:43:22] is that of the presence of god
[1:43:26] that makes an impression upon that life
[1:43:30] can i just speak very plainly
[1:43:32] this is why in this hour it's so
[1:43:34] important for lives mama daddy and
[1:43:37] different ones it's important you know
[1:43:39] where you belong
[1:43:41] it's important you know what church you
[1:43:44] belong it's not belonging to a church
[1:43:46] but to have a revelation who your pastor
[1:43:48] is
[1:43:50] because if you move every time you're
[1:43:53] offended
[1:43:54] guess what your children will follow
[1:43:56] that pattern
[1:43:58] because what you've showed them is is
[1:43:59] that when you disagree with somebody if
[1:44:01] it's at work quite
[1:44:06] if you don't agree with the pastor go
[1:44:08] somewhere else
[1:44:09] now look
[1:44:10] if anybody is led to go anywhere else i
[1:44:12] say god bless you
[1:44:14] i've never tried to keep anybody here
[1:44:16] those of you that are here you know that
[1:44:17] even those that i prayed about when
[1:44:19] you've had jobs i'm not i'm not god
[1:44:21] knows who's supposed to be here
[1:44:24] that's not from me
[1:44:25] you've never none of you've ever heard
[1:44:27] had this nor anybody outside i've never
[1:44:29] i can take this to record never told
[1:44:32] anybody to come here to church
[1:44:35] because why i'm not your revelation
[1:44:39] jesus christ has to reveal that to you
[1:44:42] because there's time because he himself
[1:44:45] is the one that holds the mystery of
[1:44:47] your life i don't he's the one that is
[1:44:49] going to speak to you personally for
[1:44:51] your home for every part of your life i
[1:44:53] don't know that he knows even how your
[1:44:56] nature how things are set forth and look
[1:44:58] as a pastor i also begin to know that as
[1:45:01] well how different ones are natured
[1:45:04] remember how remember how brother
[1:45:05] branham billy balls and they're watching
[1:45:07] you know brother brandon how brother
[1:45:08] brahma is handling different things
[1:45:09] because we're all sheep
[1:45:12] is that right
[1:45:13] oh i just love the lord don't you god is
[1:45:16] so mindful of all of all of our needs
[1:45:18] and i say it in this way this is why we
[1:45:21] want to set the right example we have to
[1:45:23] be purposeful
[1:45:28] very purposeful very intentional on the
[1:45:30] things even that what we're doing on how
[1:45:33] that we're pressing forth in our life
[1:45:35] let me just i'll close on this
[1:45:39] all through the scriptures you find how
[1:45:41] paul
[1:45:43] would give admonition
[1:45:46] follow me as i follow christ
[1:45:49] be followers of me
[1:45:51] together right
[1:45:53] so it wasn't following
[1:45:55] paul alone
[1:45:57] but that leadership was from christ
[1:46:00] moving through paul
[1:46:02] coming into the body
[1:46:04] and paul could say even to the galatians
[1:46:07] he says
[1:46:09] that jesus christ in galatians 3 1
[1:46:14] has been set evidently before your eyes
[1:46:17] in other words he's been made manifest
[1:46:23] in this scripture paul was to say
[1:46:25] in philippians 4 9
[1:46:27] those things which you have both learned
[1:46:29] and received and heard
[1:46:31] and seen in me
[1:46:34] do
[1:46:35] and the god of peace
[1:46:37] shall be with you
[1:46:39] i just heard it you've learned it but
[1:46:41] you've also seen it in action
[1:46:45] how many know you know the phrase what
[1:46:47] is the phrase a picture's worth a
[1:46:49] thousand words
[1:46:52] pictures help don't they that's why i
[1:46:54] like picture books
[1:46:56] that's why i taught elementary school
[1:46:59] i like pictures
[1:47:02] but you know
[1:47:03] brother ram tells an example
[1:47:06] of yet so you had
[1:47:07] three boys i believe
[1:47:10] and these boys grew up
[1:47:12] and they became
[1:47:14] sailors in the navy
[1:47:17] the father and mother couldn't figure it
[1:47:19] out because nobody had been in the armed
[1:47:21] forces
[1:47:22] no marines no navy
[1:47:25] nobody
[1:47:26] they couldn't figure out was going on
[1:47:29] so there was an investigation conducted
[1:47:32] and they asked these
[1:47:33] they asked these young men what was this
[1:47:37] why did you why did you turn out to be
[1:47:40] navy men
[1:47:43] and they directed the investigation back
[1:47:46] to their
[1:47:48] bedroom at night
[1:47:51] they would all be tucked in the bed and
[1:47:53] in their bedroom in front of them when
[1:47:55] they would lay down
[1:47:57] there was a picture
[1:47:58] of a vessel
[1:48:00] on a sea
[1:48:03] it was something that they saw over and
[1:48:06] over and over again
[1:48:09] and that in itself made such an
[1:48:11] impression
[1:48:13] on those men
[1:48:14] young men
[1:48:15] from boys to young men that they became
[1:48:19] sailors
[1:48:22] and of course brother branham takes that
[1:48:24] and jumps on he says if a picture
[1:48:26] of that would make someone want to
[1:48:29] become a sailor
[1:48:31] what ought the display of jesus christ
[1:48:34] too
[1:48:38] that's why i say god
[1:48:40] let that light
[1:48:42] flow and be displayed through our lives
[1:48:45] friends this is where we we look in the
[1:48:47] word and i because the holy spirit knows
[1:48:49] how to bring this down personally even
[1:48:51] to each of our lives i've tried to be
[1:48:53] very intentional just to hit
[1:48:55] in the high places here today but it's
[1:48:57] something for all of us when you think
[1:48:58] of brother brahms saying
[1:49:00] every effort we put forth make an
[1:49:03] example be an example
[1:49:05] it's something for us to stand in the
[1:49:07] light of the word and say
[1:49:09] the example that i'm living here right
[1:49:11] now
[1:49:12] is this the example i want my children
[1:49:14] to follow
[1:49:16] right
[1:49:18] because whatever example and patterns
[1:49:20] and let's just be honest there's some
[1:49:21] patterns
[1:49:22] that we need to say god
[1:49:24] those are not
[1:49:26] patterns from you
[1:49:29] and like david handed solomon the
[1:49:31] patterns to the temple by the spirit you
[1:49:33] say lord
[1:49:35] let the patterns be set right
[1:49:37] because we're not perfect but oh how we
[1:49:40] need the grace of god in our lives
[1:49:42] we need god's grace that every pattern
[1:49:44] itself that everything it would point to
[1:49:47] jesus christ we need god's grace to
[1:49:49] repent we need god's grace to lead us we
[1:49:52] need godly leadership
[1:49:54] that cultivates purposeful
[1:49:58] that cultivates godliness
[1:50:02] see this is where all of it as it comes
[1:50:04] down let's pray
[1:50:07] heavenly father
[1:50:11] lord jesus you are the author of your
[1:50:13] word
[1:50:15] lord i know that even as we look in
[1:50:18] services and moments like this lord as
[1:50:20] you've been
[1:50:22] just taking us lord in some of these
[1:50:24] pathways
[1:50:26] lord
[1:50:28] we
[1:50:28] we lord desire to
[1:50:32] just lord reflect and look lord and
[1:50:35] examine our own lives lord
[1:50:39] god i pray you'll help us lord
[1:50:43] help us lord even in
[1:50:45] realizing that the action
[1:50:47] lord our faithfulness or lack of
[1:50:49] faithfulness all of that is interpreted
[1:50:52] to our children
[1:50:54] it's interpreted to others around us no
[1:50:57] matter what we say
[1:51:00] it's our actions
[1:51:03] that make the greatest impression
[1:51:06] lord
[1:51:07] may the impression that others see like
[1:51:10] those boys
[1:51:12] may it be
[1:51:13] jesus christ a life that is
[1:51:17] oh
[1:51:18] god on fire for you
[1:51:22] and lord that on fire for you doesn't
[1:51:24] mean that we're setting down every
[1:51:26] moment of the day with our bible open
[1:51:29] because we know lord that
[1:51:31] dear god there's not even that time
[1:51:34] that's not what lord that you're
[1:51:36] expressing
[1:51:37] but god where there's an obedience
[1:51:40] to the word of god
[1:51:42] there's a faithfulness lord there's lord
[1:51:44] are looking to you for your direction
[1:51:48] and openness and an invitation
[1:51:51] that god that you can move within our
[1:51:53] homes move lord in lives move lord in
[1:51:57] situations lord
[1:51:59] god
[1:52:00] may lord
[1:52:03] we be counted oh god
[1:52:05] as those lord that are faithful
[1:52:09] lord i i could say lord i could speak i
[1:52:11] believe for every
[1:52:13] every person everyone here lord we just
[1:52:16] don't want to be
[1:52:18] associated or around this word lord
[1:52:21] we want this word oh god to so live
[1:52:24] through our lives and our hearts
[1:52:26] realizing lord
[1:52:29] we can understand all the mysteries we
[1:52:31] can understand all these things but it's
[1:52:32] a life that's to be lived it's
[1:52:35] simplicity lord
[1:52:37] you're gonna
[1:52:38] i thank lord over the years where i've
[1:52:40] lord been privileged to see different
[1:52:42] soldiers of the cross

[1:52:51] remember where was chapter it was in or
[1:52:53] so forth
[1:52:56] there wasn't lord there maybe the quote
[1:52:58] where they could remember where brother
[1:53:00] branham said this
[1:53:03] but lord it was a part of their life
[1:53:06] it just
[1:53:08] it was lived out through their life
[1:53:09] there was no question
[1:53:12] who is the love of their life
[1:53:14] you've seen it on display and you hear
[1:53:17] it
[1:53:18] even in their voice
[1:53:20] that there's a passion there's a love
[1:53:23] for the lord
[1:53:26] oh god i
[1:53:27] i'm just so thankful that it's not about
[1:53:31] our knowledge
[1:53:33] it's about the relationship of jesus
[1:53:36] christ
[1:53:39] lord i'm asking this morning if there's
[1:53:41] one that doesn't know you in that way
