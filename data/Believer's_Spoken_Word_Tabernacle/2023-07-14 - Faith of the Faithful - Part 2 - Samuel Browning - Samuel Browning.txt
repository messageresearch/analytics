[Music] amen not on the thoughts of of anything else because we could look at a lot of circumstances and we could look at it and say it's it's beyond hope but you know once it's something to wear when you've met God you know that there's no circumstance that's beyond Redemption you say brother Samuel that's an awful that's an awful big statement well I'm only making a statement from an experience and there's a number of quotes I could give you on that or with scripture but I think the prophet I love the I love the statement and I gave this to a person here not too long ago some things they were struggling with and I took them to that place in the token brother Brahm says no matter how far stooped in sin you are the grace of God through the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient to break it so you know what I say that's not the only quote I can take take from that one right there but I say no matter what situation the blood of Jesus Christ is greater and that's why I stand firm on the word that no matter what situation there's no there's no one unredeemable Satan may have wanted to try to twist a lot of things up but there's no one that's unredeemable brother Branham finishes that quote and he says if you feel that tug on your heart that's the Holy Spirit tugging upon you and you ought to just just just respond to that pulsation and say Blue Devil get out of here amen God is so good isn't he amen and amen thank God for his goodness and his grace and it's just good to be together this evening amen and uh I want to remind you if you haven't looked at the calendar here for this month please do so I know it's in the restrooms it's been sent up by email as well if you need to take a picture of it there's a lot of events brother Jerry will be with us here for a few services and then uh we'll have a fire pit Fellowship there I think it's on July 23rd it'll be next Sunday and then the following Sunday July 30th in the evening we're gonna have a youth service brother Ronnie will come up for the Youth service on that evening and so uh we've already got that out and got it posted the different uh pastors and different ones and so uh just just remember that in prayer as well so a lot of different events and if you just um if you haven't received the calendar or you need to take a picture of it just so you stay abreast of that amen let's look into the word of the Lord thank you musicians amen enjoyed that song service amen and uh we want to look here in the scriptures for just a few moments this evening and uh I want to go back here in job 23. this particular chapter was just a chapter that has just uh from way back in the fall when we started dealing with job as one of those chapters I the Holy Spirit just really took me into and we're just coming into right now but uh just from listening in the message I've heard but now I see many of these points and these thoughts and a lot of these scriptures some of these scriptures we read right here you know there's some familiar scriptures out of the Book of Job like job 19. you know we I know my redeemer liveth there's certain scriptures that are but you know you find throughout every chapter not every chapter but every you find a common theme throughout it all that job job is standing and job standing pretty pretty solid that I'm not a hypocrite I know where I'm standing and he's got all this accusation that's coming all around him but job knows if I can just if I can just talk to him if I can just talk to him and I'm sure that we all come into those places in our lives I believe that this book if we'll take for an example I believe this is this is a a book and a witness that many Through the Ages have drawn upon as a matter of fact Abraham Drew upon this experience because Abraham remember he was moved by the same revelation Nation to be buried where job was buried because because the resurrection was not promised in Egypt the resurrection was promised in Palestine amen so let's just look here in verse 8. behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him you know you take one thing from this job is speaking of him he's a person job knows him as a person he spoke to me I've heard his voice I've talked with him job knows he's here he's around here he's here so job's aware that God is the Living God and what God has done for him but he knoweth the way that I take when the earth tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food amen let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer tonight perhaps you want to be remembered in prayer your need on your heart just make it known to the Lord let's just invite him just to come Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how we thank you o God lord for the not only the promises that you've made but God to know that God you're present to keep every word and Lord you said were two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be in their midst Lord Jesus may you just come Lord I pray among us to every heart to every need Lord father of things Lord that you've Lord inspired to my heart but I'm depending on you Lord that God that you will give it Lord just as you see fit Lord as it's needed Lord God we just Reserve ourselves Lord as speaker and hear Lord oh God to your presence to your word Lord may you just come Among Us in a special way Lord and perform your word I pray o God minister to every need behind every uplifted hand or God for you're the satisfier Lord we just Lord welcome you Lord and we give ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated the scriptures I want to really to to draw from even as we look at it I I look at that in verse 11 and verse 12 and just to ponder him to look over those things and how that job could say my foot hath held his steps he's he's very much aware of God God's walking god's Direction and job is looking and when he says his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food you know it's it's something that we can we can take the word of God and I this this is God's mind this is God in printed form and it takes God to come on the scene and to inspire and to make that word live out and when God comes the word will live just exactly according to how God thought when he accepted and when it when it comes to past it'll never contradict any other previous word so when we even would speak of a greater Revelation a greater Revelation never nullifies or under or UN undoes in any way a previous Revelation it's just more of God coming on display in our life it's the same thing with justification justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is more of the same Holy Spirit and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is more of the same holy ghost coming in to take his Dwelling Place in our life and so it's just more of God unfolding himself and when we we look at this here that job had an acquaintance with the very character of God you know it's one thing to know God's word and to know the letter but to be in contact and United with God's character with God's life with God's nature it it is something that is so precious because through that it it brings us to a place to where now what is invisible to others now becomes visible through our lives it becomes God's grace to us to die to ourselves because we all go through tests and trials and frankly if we're not in a test we have come out of one or we're heading into one it's always it's a constant process because that's the whole purpose as we spoke on Sunday of that bypass the whole reason that we are here in this moment that God God makes us and gives us an opportunity to to serve him and that our lives would come in contact with him then there is a testing and a Proving Grounds in this life that's what every trial is that's what every temptation is so when Temptation comes your way don't look at temptation as a Bad Thing temptation is coming your way because it's there to only to manifest the goods that are there in your life are you hearing me so when we say this that this character that is here that job is in contact with God's character because not only do we want to just be able to look at the written word but when things are coming our way we want to act in the character and the manner that God would act out and that's where job is saying that job is saying that not only I've not declined from his nature his character that's been revealed because let me just say this there's sometimes you don't have a word for the present situation and what's taking place but there's one thing that we always do have before us if we have met him and we're looking at him and that's his character if we ever want to know of one thing when we're saying Lord I need direction for this in my life one thing we can always look at is is the character of Jesus Christ how would God display and react and move in this situation that's why brother Brandon could say Lord let it be in the typos to my mind that when something would take place don't let me get angry Lord but let me think what would Jesus do in this situation how would he act and respond in this situation I pray God help us because not only within that character notice that as we will always be in line with the character of God then we're always going to be in line with God's word and so as as job lays that out there in verse 11 and verse 12 that I have not gone back from the Commandment of his lips in other words if we could sum it up in this way in verse 11 and verse 12 that in the midst of this moment in the midst of this time there's no doubt job had trials before this took place but one thing in the midst of this job could testify and say I've Not receded I've not gone back but I am standing faithful by the grace of God because it's a not Satan's tendency is to challenge and see will we back up it all when push comes to shove whether it's on the job whether it's among the family whether it's among the church no matter where it's at when push comes to shout are we going to back up or are we going to stand on what God has revealed to you and I and when it's become a part of you and I there's a resiliency within our lives it should be that our desire is to please God more than man our desire we're called here to serve God not man serve God now notice this example here in James chapter 5 how that James would pick this up in verse 10 take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering and affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of a tender Mercy so the patience of Job and brother Brandon would pick this up in this manner and I have heard but now I see he says we find out in his life and trials and his great faith even Jesus when he came on Earth he referred to the patience of Job he said have you not read of the patience of Job see faith and that's why we're dwelling on faith Waits with patience for the promised word to be fulfilled so while we're waiting on the Fulfillment of the word no matter what it is Faith Waits but if what is called Faith quickly strictly there's a renouncing and a turning side then it was not faith Faith Waits now this Faith that's being spoke of here that faith that job had when every situation his entire environment and everything about him his body his family his close friends everyone there was no one around him that was for him there was no one to encourage him job's wife didn't encourage him in this are you hearing me she didn't even encourage him job was able to stand there and discern it you thou speak us like a foolish woman she wasn't the foolish woman but he's able to discern what's coming from her to his life there is a faith that is standing in the midst of this time and that's what I want to just dwell on for a little bit longer here is Faith of the faithful because Faith itself is the great element that God has given to you and I given to that of of mankind and everyone every person walking has Faith but what's needed is God's faith to come upon us and anoint our faith so that our faith reflects the will of God because if it's just our faith our faith alone can waver in everything else but God's faith moving down upon our life so simply put God's faith is his spirit is his life is his word are you with me that's why they listen now even in this I just want to just laying this in because that in itself when when a person has come face to face with God and that resigns within their heart that I've met God there's a faith on the inside something that's greater than what you can explain something that has lifted you from death unto life something that has changed your life that is God's faith operating in your life and through that we look to him when there's needs that happen maybe sickness in our body and Satan likes to come around when there's a need in the body I I've spoke many times with others and even in my own life sometimes you wonder because we have a if I want to say it like this a Litany of quotes we have uh uh scriptures we can go on but it's always careful to make sure that it's God handling those quotes are you with me don't allow the enemy you say well how I know it's the enemy because the enemy will take the words of God and run you in the ground with it and make you seem like nothing but a cheap nothing but the spirit of God will never do that the spirit of God is a uplifting Spirit even when he deals with sin in our life he's not dealing to put us down he's dealing to lift us up and set us free and so when we look at this in the scripture there are times that when we come in the need for even whether it's healing whether it's a job no matter the situation and we are waiting for Faith which is a revelation from God to drop concerning that situation is that right but in the meantime when we're waiting on that when we're looking and saying God I don't know what you know what what's going to come out with this here but Faith within my heart says that you are and you are healer you're the Lord that healeth all my diseases by your stripes I'm Healed and we're perfectly in line with the word of God what are we doing we're standing in a place available for that Faith to drop down because faith is a revelation that's why we walk by faith it's Revelation unto Revelation unto revelation so in many different situations and I I say that just as a little side note because sometimes we what has been called faith is actually hope well you just need to step out by faith well Peter just didn't step out by faith he was bidden to come hear him hear me now you just need to take off to this other state by faith ah faith is a revelation it's something that drops in your heart another place brother Rams says it is the revelation of the will of God that's what faith is and we need his leadership for each moment and each time in our life that's why for a believer's life if there's anything that even you are are planning to Embark upon that is not solid in your heart that you've got a word from God don't do it don't do it because if you go ahead and do it then there's going to be regrets later on why did I do this don't go by motion go by a settled walk with God that God's dropped in your heart and if God don't drop it in your heart if there's nothing in coming what do I do wait on the Lord and say God is there something I'm looking at maybe it's not right maybe it's me Lord that's not right but whatever it is I know that you're a God who reveals yourself and makes known your will your desire is your will for my life then you're in a place for Faith to drop faith is standing there but then you're in a place for God to reveal his will for the next step I think we all have done things we've been on you you're uncertainty and uncertain about certain things you do well I I hope this is it I hope that we don't want to do that and we learn we learn we learn with them yes we are Sons and Daughters of God but it's not us wielding wielding God's will to our will the victory is Lord let thine will be done not my will now Faith Waits with patience for the promised word to be fulfilled think about think about Joseph and we mentioned this on Sunday how Joseph waited for the word to be fulfilled he had a word but here he is in bondage and the Bible would say it like this until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him what's Joe Joseph what are you going to do what is what's going to take place his everything that's happening doesn't make sense there's nothing about Joseph when he's going through it I'm not talking about us reading about it we can look at it all the perfect type of Christ and all that's us seeing us seeing it but while he was going through it he didn't see that kind of sounds familiar doesn't it a lot of times we don't see things that we're going through we don't see any benefit we don't see why is this and what how is this going to work out we're not seeing that Joseph was the same way every believer has been the same way job has been the same way so what are you saying welcome to the club but what does that bring me to trusting in Him and trust is Faith Lord I don't understand this Faith doesn't require me to understand it faith is I just know that God's in control that's what I know I know where I'm standing in here God's in control and until the next order comes I'm going to stay right here I'm gonna stay right here with what he's revealed I'm going to stay right here now notice in first Thessalonians chapter one let's look at a few examples among some believers and Paul a very familiar scripture we read from in first Thessalonians 5 and I don't have this included but it's one we're familiar with for the gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake I I I could I could preach on this a while but do you realize God has not left us to our own devices God has not left you and I in a place to say create your own atmosphere for faith but God is responsible to create that atmosphere you'll see what brother Samuel am I not as a Believer to create an atmosphere how do I create the atmosphere you step into the atmosphere that he's creating see the Holy Ghost came the Holy Ghost came and brought much Assurance notice there was a gathering by the word the people had to come into a place by the word already into a place of being in one Accord just like it was in Acts chapter 2 the what what brings the people into a place of unity the word what brought the fire down on Mount Carmel Elijah said I've done this at Thy word he gathered the Loose Ends and tied them in to the altar that brought the fire of God it's the word that gives order it's the word that gives Direction in our life simple Direction leads to the blessing of God and so notice God's desire this is the whole purpose of God's presence coming in the Fulfillment of his word is to bring within our hearts a much assurance an assurance that even for whatever need that you have you've got Assurance to step out of the boat you've got Assurance to step in the troubled water you've got Assurance to take God at his word who is that that's doing it it's God fulfilling his word who wants it that caused the woman with the issue of blood when she said if I can but Touch the Hem of His Garment it was God in Christ it had made an impression upon her heart something was scary she had heard in the Fulfillment of the word now she's in the presence of the word being fulfilled there's an atmosphere of faith that is there to ignite and charge that faith that she has that it can be released and it was a different touch it was a different touch I just if we can just take that just for a moment we could preach a month or Sunday's on there what are you saying by the same I'm just saying just be ready when you even you come here be ready just to step in be ready said God help me to be a channel help me to shut all the things of the world out and not just here not just here but in every part of the Lord help me just to shut it down and help me just to become a channel that's ready just to step in because of much Assurance Lord and you became followers of us I want to read this verse 6 and you became followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much Affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost that so that you were in samples to all that believe in Macedonia and acacia for from you I love this scripture sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Acacia now notice the word of the Lord came to them through God's servant but they received that word Paul would write of it in another place for this Thessalonian Church they received the word not as the word of men but as the word of God but effectually worketh in your life and they've received this word now through their lives because see the word is not a dead letter the word is a living reality it lives it's called living himself out it's not me struggling well I gotta put an apple I gotta put a leaf out I gotta put a branch out it's not me struggling it's God living out his life that's what the whole rest of the Holy Ghost is about not me it's not I that liveth not my power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord Brother say no what that is saying is I know God let me get out of the way help me to get out of the way and you just be a channel that's what God wants sometimes our things that we can think so spiritual is actually us getting in the way and God is saying I'm not going to come down and put my hand to it lest thou should get the glory but it's surrendering yourself to me how do I Surrender obey the word obey the word obey the word what God is speaking to your heart what God is dealing with just obey the word and watch God come on the scene but also in every place notice in every place your faith to God word is spread abroad so that we need not to speak anything notice your faith so it's God's faith that has moved down behind their faith right that's so what the world says and can look and say man what a faithful bunch of people but it's not a faithful people on our own faith it's God's faith moving behind us that's the secret the faith of the faithful right that's where the whole secret and so I want you to notice watch how we read in verse 9 I want you to see the effect here of that influence of the word living out for they themselves show us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turn to God from Idols to serve the living and true God notice the effect of the word the effect of the word is turning their lives this was the thessalonikians it turned their lives from Idols to the Living God and that same faith that they had now operating in their life it's having an effect on others you see God's faith and your faithfulness listen friends your faithfulness my faithfulness it's not for you it's not for me this is this and the whole the whole synopsis if we can say it like this of a Christian Life is a sacrificial life it's living for others not that our life becomes a stopper on the end but it only becomes a place that another channel is plugged into we are a body one entity is not the body the arm is not the body the eye is not the body but the body is the body all together and we need one another and this and the effect this is the effect they're showing us what manner of entering in we had to do so the testimony Paul say what we're seeing in other places is the testimony of God's working that has moved in your life and now work through your life to affect others oh God help us Lord Jesus and to wait for his son from Heaven whom he raised from the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the Wrath to come Faith Waits with patience for the prophesied promise and to realize there's no other way for us to actually get patience without faithfulness patience is the outcome of faithfulness we all want more patience right right now right now want more patience right I don't think I hadn't touched one in the room now with that statement but but patience is the outcome of faithfulness through times like this through times of testing and trying through times when we're not getting any answer seems like we're not making any Headway so so to say what we feel or we think we might feel like our prayers are hitting the ceiling and coming right back down on us but this is a time that standing faithful by his faith Lord I know I have met you I know where I'm standing with you I my feelings all around me right now there are feelings that are contrary to the reality inside of me Paul said Galatians 5 5 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith how are we through the spirit waiting for the hope of righteousness by faith so what has Faith done what does faith do because you'll find many times as brother random will tell us hope is the biggest enemy that faith has but it's when hope is instead of faith but you know the Bible says Hebrews 11 1 faith is the substance of things hopeful so the word hope and the scripture is an expectation so what faith actually does is it puts in your hand a real expectation so it's something that it's not I don't know I don't know if God's going to do this I don't know if God know but Faith actually puts it in your hand and where you're able to stand there and say nope I know what God Said you might have a thousand reports that will come contrary no but I know what God Said see Caleb and Joshua they had all kinds of reports ten to two right God always works in the minority and God works in that way where all he needs is Faith in one heart it doesn't matter of all the opposition it doesn't matter of all those things listen to me Caleb and Joshua I know we've heard him preached on a lot but Caleb and Joshua were not super people in their own DNA they weren't people just like you and I the prophets that James wrote of were people just like you and I as a matter of fact he said they were subject to like passions in other words ups and downs just like we have so they weren't in themselves super human people but there was a super God that was greater than the feebleness of their Humanity when their Humanity would get down Lord I'm the only one there's nobody else that loves you there's nobody else to live for you and God would encourage his servant and say wait a minute you're just looking at all that you can see and all that you can feel but I have reserved unto me seven thousand glory be to God I'm glad those examples are included in there aren't you so it takes God you see our faith in our life brother Brandon would take this in faith is the victory if you get a chance to listen to that message brother Randall go into that of how that all the way through that message he deals with and even coming to the end of it of how that our faith he says when your faith he said maybe you've been up and down and in and out and everything else he said what you need is for God to come down and operate on your faith so God doesn't take our faith away but the holy ghost coming in our life is an operation of the spirit of God God's faith coming down to operate on our faith what is it doing taking away from within all of the unbelief then then notice a scripture faith is this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith but I thought it's going to be God's faith it is God's faith but it's God's faith that has operated on our faith he is operated on our face so it is faith that overcometh the world that's why when a person say well I don't have no faith no you have faith faith is a common thing God laid it out so clearly to apply the blood apply the blood with hyssa and his son is a common weed oh a person had to do was take what was being said and applied they didn't have to understand it they just had to take it there was a belief there was a saddleness this is what God has said and God has spoken God is with this man God has Vindicated this word God has Vindicated this message and take that word and apply it I don't think anybody got in your car and wonder tonight is it going to start why because that's faith faith is an unconscious thing you're not sitting here worried tonight am I going to find my way back home why faith is an unconscious thing that's natural but you understand what you and I were built for and made for as Sons and Daughters of God that when God comes in and operates on that Faith then the faith of God now it becomes unconscious to us as a people of God to stand on God's word it becomes it doesn't become a well it's called prayer meeting and see if we should keep this word or not we've met God and it's an unconscious Faith it's just it's the place that as I said whether I have received a direct word from God or not faith says that he gave a promise in his word that by his stripes I'm Healed so I can stand on that word what is it it becomes a faith that's unconscious listen to me now this is where the enemy wants to bring us to a Consciousness I'm not going to ask you this question because I want nobody get in trouble but everyone is probably drove down the road to your house and you got off on an exit and you wondered how did I just get here don't say nothing because I don't want your wife taking the keys away and you wonder how'd you get here it's unconscious it's kind of scary after it happens kind of scary even one time when I was had to stop when I was teaching school I had to stop in your plans for my class well it was kind of it was normal when I got off the exit 250 in Sandusky when I get back when I'm getting back on I go east onto two I'm supposed to be going west would you see something broke the continuity and I went back East oh Lord I got to get off in here and turn around hope I make it in time to work why just unconscious now what I'm saying is is that's how we were made to operate as Sons and Daughters of God in other words to where we're not having to stop and think and you say brother Sammy what are you talking about Satan's desire is to bring our walk into a conscious Realm and he likes to put traps in our life there's mistakes that are made there's sin but listen to me there is Grace if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to bring us back into an unconscious walk foreign because when you're conscious it's you walk up and down your stairs from your basement or up to your second floor you don't think about the distance between these stairs right you start thinking about them you'll trip right you start thinking about promises in God's word I'm talking about thinking of them where you break into a conscious realm and you're looking at whether you're worthy or not you you're never going to be worthy in your own accord our worthiness is by the blood of the Lamb okay how many how many days in a row that you'd say I've had I've had a good day it is because of the grace of God it's not an excuse to live anyway but it's to remember it's God's grace in our life and God's desire is for us to remember no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life Joshua I want you to walk unconscious of fear I want you to walk unconscious what how do I do that just keep all the channels cleared out between me and you as the Son of God that's your responsibility I say God help me say God help me yeah God help me thank God we have something greater than Liquid Plumber we got the Holy Ghost so having on the breath and notice in Ephesians 6 I don't have time to read this but out of Ephesians 6 remember it says let me just read a couple verses wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand well what all have you and I done to stand we've taken his way job said he knows the way I take because it's his way he's revealed the provided way so having done all this that what have I done we have yielded to his voice walked in obedience to his word yielded to his spirit and knowing that that's what's needed in order to be able to stand in this day not be conformed to the world back and forth but you see all of these things all of these parts of this armor because the word of God wrapped up in our life it's all these parts our life everything is meant to walk in a unit of Harmony I said I wasn't going to read it but I just feel to do that as we're looking at this stand there for having your loins gird about with truth you know what your loins are where they would wear the long garments and as the garments were long when they had to move like when they're coming out of Egypt when the father ran to the prodigal son he had to take his garments and tuck them in why so that his way was unimpeded in other words not hindered and that's where the word of God having your loins Gert about with truth having his word about your life and having on the breastplate of righteousness that's simply doing what's right simply doing what's right and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of thief faith of peace and above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked notice the shield of Faith but you'll be able to fuse that Shield of Faith to quench all the fiery darts what is it it's not that darts won't be shot they're going to be fired they're going to be fired and remember why they are fiery darts it is meant to ignite a flammable source so cover your buttons cover your buttons because the the docks will fly to push your buttons darts will fly but how do I quench them the shield of faith The Shield of Faith all of this working together in a unit and a Harmony of the Holy Spirit and take the helmet of salvation or mine our mind is filled with the word of God and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit now I want you to think about it like this um this picture I tried to look up and I've seen there's a lot of different uh pictures that come and I I don't want to show the wrong one but brother Brown talks about this picture it's called the Cloudland one from Germany remember he talks about how that when you walked into this um the museum there the art museum that when you're looking at that picture from a distance man it looks like a storm that's coming that's going to turn tear the place wide open and brother Brian said but the guide came along and told us move up closer now who who would want to get closer to clouds that look like that imagine taking your mind some of the worst clouds you've seen come on we've seen them even over the past few days still clouds that you can look at and you know by looking at them clouds it's not a question of should I go fishing today or not you look at those clouds and know it's time to get indoors right it's a time when you look at those clouds and say change plans no barbecue tonight right the clouds they're there they give they give them the signal and brother Brown's talking about looking at these clouds and he says and the guide itself he said actually encouraged us go and look a little closer and so one was looking as just a horrible thing and Gloom but as the people move closer they realized it's angel's wings beating together and and you think about it the natural reaction would be to pull back come on friends sometimes in situations and that's where the test comes think about what job said his way of kept I'm not declined I've not gone back from his Commandments I've esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food when we're seeing situations that are taking place in order to walk up to that situation you've got to be certain he's God and being certain he's God is not just something we read about but then we've met him but we also know that in my life right now I know I'm standing where God has ordained me to stand there's nothing between me and him anything that he's brought to my attention I've made it right I've confessed my wrongs I've confessed my sin then you can be certain of God why because that's where faith faith can't operate if there's anything in the way understand what the old sleuth's desire is is to get our lives Tangled is to get things into our lives sometimes it can even be funny feelings and there's things about it that we need to look and say God I need your character I believe your character of your life is in me Lord and I want to die to my way of doing things I want to die from way my response is Lord I want to die to myself what are you doing being certain of God so that in the midst of a situation we're moving closer and brother Brown says then when you can look at that picture he said really what it is it was a blessing in disguise the Gloom itself the Gloom was actually a blessing in disguise but from a long distance it looks horrible let me say this no matter your trouble no matter your test and let me just say it if we've God is a god of faithfulness he's the god of mastery if we fail to test there'll be a repeat there'll be a repeat you think oh my Lord no it's a God oh my Lord mold me help me to grow from this see God God's word you you say look the same man why would he do that because you're a part of God God's word in you and God can't fail God's word has never been defeated and I'd say God help me what is real perfect Faith relying on what he has made you that's what the Lord Jesus walked in a world of perfect Faith because he relied on what his father made him to me that's a that's a powerful statement that we could just sit down and just say God help that to just sink deep in my heart rely upon what God has made us rely upon the god that has changed your life and what he's done in your life how he's changed you how he's brought you from just a creature of time that's walking in this realm and all you see is this realm but now you're aware there's another realm that's present a living God that's present what is it it's a world of perfect faith and you're relying not upon yourself but upon what he has made you that's faith oh my God help us help us Lord Jesus I want to just I want just trying to bring this down here this is where Paul would say in second Thessalonians 3 1 finally Brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord may have free course I say yet Grant it Lord pray for me that the word hath free course I pray for you the word would have free course and be glorified even as it is with you that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men let's say Amen Lord help me to know Lord when I'm in that kind of a place help me Lord is that right Paul Paul and Paul admonish the people in Timothy hey don't get caught up in Endless genealogies and trying to prove this and I'm going to debate him on the website forget about it God never called us to debate and try to prove somebody wrong because you're not going to turn anybody around anyhow with any kind of debate is that right it'll take the spirit of almighty God we can be as slick as we can be with our words but do you realize it'll never be words that'll ever turn anybody it will take the supernatural working of almighty God to turn the heart of a person is that right now notice this for all men have not Faith verse 3 but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil thank you Lord it's rest he'll continue to establish US settle us and keep us from evil and we have confidence in the Lord touching you notice how Paul writes this Paul didn't say we have confidence in you we have confidence in the Lord touching you in other words you're his you he has touched you through the ministry that he has delegated he Paul could say in that he has delegated through me as a vessel but you are God's working you're his workmanship so we've got confidence in the Lord touching you that no matter what we can't see but you belong to him and it's God working in your life so our confidence is in the Lord that ye both do and will do the things which we command you and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God well I thought they were already in the love of God they were but do you realize the word keeps leading us deeper it'll continue notice what the Lord will do he won't direct us away it'll direct us further into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ now notice in second Corinthians chapter four I'm trying to get somewhere second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 13. now remember Paul's just wrote about here of this of this Excellency of God's power in Earth and vessels what a contrast you know to think about you put the glorious power of deity in fragile frail Earthen vessels vessels that not like the plastic ones from Lowe's but pots that if you don't set them down just right if you drop them they'll break and God has so placed his spirit inside of Earthen vessels now there's probably no doubt not one of us in here but hasn't felt like sometimes that we have been broke all to pieces and there's no doubt maybe our flesh has maybe our spirit has but that Inside Man and that's who you really are it's God that's holding you together that's the Paradox that through every situation it's the power of God that's holding you together as a matter of fact that's the very word remember how God would tell Joshua Don't Be Afraid don't be dismayed he would say that over and over the word dismayed means not to be broke into pieces God knows how to keep us together to me that's a Marvel and a miracle at times when I feel like I've went to pieces I feel like that ever I feel like everything is shattered maybe within you know you're broken maybe in your spirit you're discouraged but there is Faith on the inside there's something Beyond the Veil that holds you and I something that you can explain I can't explain it's the Excellency of the power of God now notice how Paul would write this in verse 13 we having the same Spirit of Faith same faith that all before have had what is it the same spirit of Faith God's life according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you so Paul is not saying we know that we're going to be brought out of this situation as far as alive but what he is saying is that one thing we know there is nothing can hinder what God has done in our soul I don't know what the next move is we're persecuted all around but we ain't forsaken there is an assurance of faith that brings faithfulness in the midst of these times and it speaks that way what is it it's the spirit of Faith operating in our life I'm sure every one of us have testified to this that there's things that you have spoke that as far as in your natural feelings you didn't feel a bit more spiritual than nothing you didn't feel a bit more Victorious than nothing but there is a resolve within your heart that says I know my redeemer lives I know God is working this out right now what is it it's where you're going beyond your feelings because let's face it friends it's only when we're on the top of the mountain that our feelings are where they need to be but which when we're in the valley God proves himself in the times of the valley it's the times we need the spirit of faith that we speak according to the revelation of God's faith in our heart that's why the prophet there in the fifth seal said I am going to speak this according to the revelation of my faith I am part of the rapture going in a rapture [Applause] I am set free he is my helper I am healed foreign [Applause] that's just a bunch of workups shame on you he's the high priest of our confession not the high priest of our feelings right he's touched by the feelings of our weaknesses it's your needs that's brought him here tonight he hasn't come here tonight to put on a show he's come here tonight because you're and my infirmities have drawn upon him and he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities glory be to God thank you Lord Jesus oh my this is why faith Brothers sees the resurrection a god of Resurrection That's The Power of Faith to believe when standing over behind the Dark Cloud that you can't see with your natural eyes but Faith standing by you directs you to that God of resurrection and a God of all wisdom who has ordained our path he's standing just behind every trial I love that faith standing by my side I'm not alone it's Faith you understand it's Faith that's directing us I got a little down when this situation came along when the doctors read me this report the fear first came along and you know the devil's just been telling me I ain't nothing but an unbeliever I know why are you repeating what a liar would say fear will come doubt can come but there is a power on the inside there is a faith to direct you that the Lord is my deliverer sure your humanity is there to pick those things up but the god part that faith on the inside is there to direct you and I hate wait a minute God has never failed though you can't see it through the doctor's report but he's standing right behind it though you can't see it through that cloud but he's standing right behind that cloud let me just close with this here thank you Father God it's a story it's a story it says one day a young lady was driving along with her father and They Came Upon a storm and the young lady asked her father what should I do he said keep driving cars begin to pull over to the side the storm was getting worse what should I do the young lady asked keep driving her father replied on up a few feet she noticed that 18 wheelers that semis were also pulling over she told her dad I must pull over you see what's happening she sees the cars the storm what must I do keep going she's cars pulling over this car is pulling over this one's leaving this one's turning us on what should I do keep driving keep going now 18 wheelers preachers bigger things they're pulling over I mean you know when you're driving the storm hey if 18 wheelers are pulling over in a snowstorm you kind of get the thinking I might as well find somewhere to pull over right so here it is the pressure of what she's seeing all around her she noticed 18 wheelers were also pulling over she told her dad I must pull over I can barely see ahead it is terrible and everyone is pulling over her father told her don't give up just keep driving now the storm was terrible but she never stopped and soon she could see a little more clearly after a couple miles she was again on dry land and the sun came out her father said now you can pull over and get out she said but why now he said when you get out look back at all the people that gave up and are still in the storm because you never gave up your stormy is now over [Applause] keep driving faith of the faith will keep driving no matter if you all walk away I'm gonna keep driving we're going to keep going hey man keep going but 18 we're gonna keep going and then as you're out of the storm you can look back because your Storm's over well I think not only in this moment but I think one of these mornings no wonder Paul could write the things that we're facing are not even Worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US I say God keep me true Lord keep me true Lord help me to keep my eyes on the Eastern Sky help me just Lord the key stay focused on the coming of the Lord many distractions that's true 18 wheelers cars everything else but let us just stay faithful and with every step of the way what God knows just what we have need of Lord help me to stay as a channel that's my prayer I think it'd be good if we pray for one another tonight Lord help us to remain as channels that are free for Faith to move I want to walk as an unconscious Son of God unconscious of fear unconscious of failure but under the Dominion of the love of God what his love has made me where he took me from many people were in the same pit but he lifted you and me out of that pit he lifted us I didn't lift myself you didn't lift yourself he lifted us yes that's love not what I deserved not what you deserved but that's what his love has done for us what a precious thing it is to walk with god let's pray our heads in prayer Heavenly Father Faith Lord of the faithful I'm certain Lord that as we will stand there on that day it'll be very much like the Lord we feel right now in our hearts this evening that God we can look back over our lives and know that Lord It's Your Grace that's been provided to bring us to this moment Lord your faith Lord how you've come down and operated on our faith I pray that God that here tonight if there's one that has not had that operation on their faith may they Lord take the promise of the Living God as you've made yourself real to us right here tonight and the promise Lord that God you're a stabilizer you are the one who stabilizes our life Lord you come down lord and you raise our life that Faith from where it's just up and down and in and out Lord and wondering to where it becomes stable not because of our mind but because of your faith Lord God of that experience like Moses your Prophet would tell us Lord Moses had great faith but he needed his faith to be anointed and when he got in the presence of the burning bush his faith became anointed by the revelation of God the faith of God and when that anointing came he did not come upon a man who thought he could do something but rather in your presence is where he realized like Isaiah and like the rest of us Lord I'm unfit in myself to do what you have ordained to be done but Lord the same way you did with Moses the same way with Isaiah the same with each of us and really Lord that work from the New Birth then on through our life is you drawing us into that place to rely upon you Lord that's what the blessing and invitation of the new birth is is to where that we no longer have to rely upon our way upon our own self but where Lord we are relying upon you relying upon what you have made us what you have brought to pass in our life and we rely upon you Lord father I pray tonight Lord grant it Lord May Lord if there's one here that has not had that experience yet that operation upon their faith may they Lord realize that it's worth more to seek after that to seek after you then anything of this world because the temporal things will soon fade away it will soon be filled with rust and Decay it'll become of no value what value we hold in it now will be lost but Lord God it's those things that are eternal that's what really matters Lord granted I pray father this evening Lord as we take encouragement from your word Lord and like job to be able to stand with this comfort in our lives Lord Jesus your Wayne have we kept Lord help us Lord help us that in the midst of situations your Prophet would tell us to conduct ourselves with joy to conduct ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God granted Lord Jesus Lord sometimes it's not the easiest thing Lord our flesh is pulled many different ways we're honest about that Lord but father our desire Lord and where the victory is is we yield to that inner man Lord and by faith bring the outside man and every feeling in subjection to the word of God help us Lord may we stand may each and every one of us hear Lord stand as channels that's lord of the hands that were lifted up along with my hands Lord we want to remain as channels Lord that are free that are clear that can walk Lord as Sons and Daughters of God unconscious of fear and failure but Lord God walking in that world of a perfect Faith walking Lord Jesus with you Lord help us Lord maybe there's one here tonight Lord where the picture looks awful gloomy but God I pray father may you Lord move down for them in a special way Lord if there's anything Lord that's wrong Lord to know that God that you are mindful Lord when we have confessed our wrongs Lord and made restitution that Lord Jesus then we can stand upon that word being certain that you are God and our faith Lord God being able to stand there o God and say Lord though I see clouds that look terrible but oh God I'm going to walk closer as the god of the holy spirit is bidding me to come closer to realize there is blessings though in disguisement but yet blessings help us tonight father we pray may we draw nearer Lord draw nearer I pray in Jesus name amen amen you love him oh Hallelujah let's stand glamor the bride lead us [Music] thank you there are two words okay [Music] oh

what you're doing in your body Lord Jesus thank you father I pray that you bless all the brothers and sisters here tonight Lord May the Holy Ghost go with them Lord God may you strengthen our faith Lord May our human faith be backed up by God's faith Lord just drop it down in our hearts Lord whatever situation we're facing right now Lord granted we pray Lord be with us watch over us Lord those
