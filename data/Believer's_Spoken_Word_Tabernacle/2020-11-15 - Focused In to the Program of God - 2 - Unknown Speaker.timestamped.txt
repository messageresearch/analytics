[32:12] [Music]
[32:25] the my love
[32:27] [Music]
[32:46] holy holy
[32:50] [Music]
[32:51] name God bless you I ask you to have
[32:53] your
[32:54] seats just for a moment here before we
[32:58] get into the word and just so thankful
[33:02] for what the Lord is doing in our midst
[33:06] am amen and I just really just
[33:09] appreciate how that the Lord just you
[33:13] know allowed brother Wayne to come by
[33:16] and uh to be here with us and to
[33:18] minister the word of the
[33:20] lord we had it set up for a few months
[33:23] and it just it worked out in that way
[33:26] and uh we just we thank God for that and
[33:29] then brother brother Andrew being able
[33:31] to to come by and you know you you look
[33:36] at everything that God has the gifts
[33:38] that he places within the body those
[33:41] gifts are for him to use for us now you
[33:46] recognize that many times a person can
[33:49] walk right by a gift of God think when
[33:51] Jesus stood there at the well and he's
[33:53] speaking to the woman he didn't try to
[33:57] convince her
[33:58] of the gift of God but yet that gift of
[34:00] God was for her the only thing that had
[34:03] to take place is how that God would come
[34:05] down and God would use that gift she
[34:07] would recognize that was a gift of God
[34:11] for me and when she could recognize that
[34:14] brother Brandon puts it this way in
[34:15] spiritual food in due season he said God
[34:18] comes down and he embodies himself in a
[34:21] gift and he said yet you have to be
[34:24] gifted to believe it and he said so then
[34:28] actually said it's how God is working
[34:30] between the gifts in our life and that's
[34:33] the secret food I tell you friends if if
[34:37] only a person can see well God sent a
[34:40] prophet or God did this you miss
[34:42] everything right to not see God present
[34:46] in his bride body the same today as he
[34:51] was yesterday to not see that is to miss
[34:55] really what the message is all about
[34:58] because it is Christ in you it's God who
[35:02] has come to identify himself in
[35:07] flesh amen the ministry of Malachi 4 was
[35:11] to call us back to where the church had
[35:13] fallen from amen that it would be a real
[35:17] uniting to where it is now Christ and
[35:20] his bride not two separate people but
[35:23] one amen it's a union amen a word that
[35:27] brings a union in this hour and we just
[35:31] thank God for that and I thank the Lord
[35:33] for the gifts in the body and every gift
[35:36] I'm glad every gift isn't the
[35:39] same you ever look at a flowers I came
[35:41] in last Sunday and had a a bouquet of
[35:44] flowers on my desk back there and uh you
[35:46] know you look at those flowers and I
[35:48] know sometimes I've had my you know wife
[35:50] and you know probably you do too and if
[35:52] you don't maybe you can just take this
[35:54] little hint when you get a red roses
[35:58] well they're all red but you know
[36:00] sometimes they'll put like little white
[36:02] Parts in there and what it does it's the
[36:04] contrast that actually cause things to
[36:07] stand out you know that's the how it is
[36:10] even in our life there's a contrast that
[36:12] allows the real God to stand out in our
[36:14] life there's things that God even has
[36:17] there's things even not only in gifts
[36:19] but even in our own life there's things
[36:20] that allow God to stand out just like in
[36:23] our life there's strengths there's
[36:24] weaknesses but in it all it's not our
[36:27] strength that God is using it's not all
[36:30] together our weaknesses it's those
[36:31] surrendered to him and it's God using
[36:35] them and that's what we want that's what
[36:37] we we thank God for that of the the
[36:39] great bouquet of flowers and for each
[36:41] and every one because we all we all are
[36:44] we are together in this in the economy
[36:48] of God and we that's that is a that's
[36:51] something that is so uh becomes very
[36:54] much more precious to us in this hour I
[36:57] just say it like this yes we have family
[36:58] I have family in other places but you're
[37:01] my
[37:02] family you're my family I make decisions
[37:05] based on you above my natural
[37:10] family because this is the family of God
[37:14] this this is what this is what is really
[37:17] more real to me than that natural family
[37:20] we love our natural family thanks be to
[37:22] God we recognize there's another there's
[37:25] a greater family that we're a part of
[37:27] and that's the family of God we came
[37:30] from that tree and now we're identified
[37:32] back into that tree amen so we we just
[37:36] we just love the Lord and I want to uh
[37:39] this
[37:40] morning um want to present here uh
[37:44] another uh brother here uh at the
[37:47] request of the trustees and as they
[37:50] express their desire to see younger ones
[37:52] carry the burden uh that they have
[37:54] carried Faithfully some of them since
[37:56] the beginning of the assembly uh along
[37:59] with the trustee board and with myself
[38:02] we would like to recommend to you
[38:03] brother Shane derot to sered this local
[38:06] body of Believers in the office of a
[38:08] trustee and we certainly thank the Lord
[38:11] for brother Shane and his lovely wife
[38:14] sister Lily and uh thankful For What the
[38:17] Lord Has Done and what he's doing in
[38:19] their lives and um after asking brother
[38:23] Shane to prayerfully consider this he
[38:25] convited that those are things that he
[38:27] even that in their time of devotion and
[38:29] praying is that they asked God lord what
[38:32] would you have us to do you know that's
[38:34] the first thing that when God met Paul
[38:38] on the road to Damascus Paul when he saw
[38:41] him and God spoke to him he said what
[38:43] would you have me do and you know that
[38:46] that's that's not just you know an
[38:48] office in a church you could pray people
[38:49] could have an office in a church and
[38:51] miss it but it's the reality is is
[38:53] that's when God speaks to a heart and
[38:55] that's where where surrender comes what
[38:57] would you had me do you recognize my
[38:59] purpose is greater than what I thought
[39:00] it was you can have all sorts of
[39:03] Ambitions in life but if the Ambitions
[39:05] themselves are not under the leadership
[39:08] of the Lord we've got the wrong
[39:10] order so we just ask brother Shane to
[39:13] prayerfully consider this and he
[39:15] confided that even the burden that the
[39:17] Lord had already placed on his heart so
[39:19] we'd like to present him this morning
[39:21] and take a vote and um I want you to
[39:23] remember I almost have to say this
[39:24] tongue and cheek now uh but remember the
[39:27] vote it's not almost as we do in this
[39:29] nation and you could say I hope
[39:31] not I hope not um but uh this one here
[39:36] we don't have any machines that'll skew
[39:38] votes or nothing like that um what we
[39:40] want to do is we just just buy an
[39:43] uplifted hand but we're going to ask you
[39:44] to Bow your heads in just a moment just
[39:48] to remember this vote it's a vote of
[39:50] confidence in the leading of the
[39:52] Lord so let's just bow our heads and as
[39:55] all our heads and our hearts are V and
[39:57] as every member of this church that
[39:59] comes here regular supports it with your
[40:01] tithes and offerings which is considered
[40:03] a member of this church while myself
[40:06] alone looks I would ask if this church
[40:09] finds brother Shane derot to be a just
[40:11] man and eligible by the best of your
[40:13] thinking to be a trustee to serve the
[40:16] local body here if you do signify by the
[40:19] raising of your
[40:22] hand
[40:24] okay put your hands down if there's any
[40:27] contrary would you raise your hand at
[40:29] this
[40:30] time okay let's raise our heads amen God
[40:34] bless you brother Shane it's 100% across
[40:38] the board I'd like to just ask brother
[40:40] Shane he'd go ahead and come on up and I

[43:52] look into the word of the Lord and thank
[43:53] the musicians certainly appreciate them
[43:58] and let's turn to Genesis
[44:00] 22 this morning if you
[44:05] would and we want to just read a few
[44:07] verses of
[44:10] scripture and um this is
[44:14] a what I
[44:16] just where I was trying to get
[44:20] to one of the Thursday nights here and
[44:22] we just just the Lord had other plans to
[44:26] to come forth for with some things
[44:28] so we want to just look at a few verses
[44:32] here this morning and there's no way
[44:34] we'll get fully into it but Genesis
[44:38] 221 and it came to pass after these
[44:42] things that God did tempt Abraham and
[44:46] said unto him Abraham and he said behold
[44:51] here I
[44:53] am God knew where to find him right he
[44:57] said Abraham he called him by his
[45:00] Priestly name
[45:02] Abraham he said behold here I am what a
[45:07] wonderful amen place to be standing to
[45:11] know you're standing in the word of
[45:15] God behold here I am I'm standing Lord
[45:18] in all that you've revealed and made
[45:21] known to me to this time this is where I
[45:25] am and he said said take now thy son
[45:29] thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest
[45:33] and get thee into the land of
[45:36] Mariah and offer him therefore a burnt
[45:39] offering upon one of the mountains which
[45:42] I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up
[45:45] early in the morning and saddled his ass
[45:48] and took two of his young men with him
[45:51] and Isaac his son and clave the wood for
[45:54] the burnt offering and rose up
[45:57] and went unto the place of which God had
[46:02] told him I want you to catch that went
[46:05] unto the place of which God had told him
[46:10] he wasn't going somewhere that hadn't
[46:13] already been told to him
[46:15] right then on the third
[46:19] day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[46:23] the place a far off something about that
[46:24] Third Day on on the third day Abraham
[46:28] lifted up his eyes and saw the place a
[46:33] far off amen I'd like to speak to you on
[46:38] focused in to the program of God Amen
[46:43] may God bless you as you're being seated
[46:45] this morning may he bless his
[46:50] word the scripture that we see here in
[46:53] verse
[46:55] one uh you know through the scripture I
[46:59] probably as a Bible reader you've taken
[47:01] these things before and looked at them
[47:03] you find it over and over through the
[47:04] Book of
[47:06] Revelations after these
[47:08] things after these things there's a lot
[47:12] of things that we can go through there's
[47:14] chapters and so forth that of Trials
[47:19] there's chapters of disappointment and
[47:21] trials are not disappointments trials
[47:23] are where Faith itself is manifested
[47:27] you know our life itself it's not it's
[47:30] not a a picture book uh being an
[47:33] elementary teacher I happen to like P
[47:35] picture books but our life is a chapter
[47:38] book and there's chapters in our life
[47:41] and there's chapters and and parts
[47:43] within our life and so there's always a
[47:46] progression there's always uh it hones
[47:49] in you know as you read in on the book
[47:52] and you start to look and find the plot
[47:54] and what's the direction of the story
[47:56] you you start to hone in on all that and
[47:59] then that is the reason really why you
[48:01] have other characters coming in
[48:03] sometimes at first you don't understand
[48:05] why did this character come in or why
[48:07] did this one but as things go on and
[48:09] you're able to come into a place in the
[48:12] book where you can kind of start to look
[48:14] back you think oh now I see why this one
[48:16] had to come in and why this one had to
[48:19] come in and and so we look at it that
[48:21] the Bible itself it's it's it's one it's
[48:25] the expression of one great goal and one
[48:28] achievement that God has
[48:31] had all of all of the the the the saints
[48:35] of God everyone down through time even
[48:37] as we read this with Abraham were actors
[48:41] in The Great ofc economy and program of
[48:44] God they weren't just doing something
[48:47] just to do it they they were
[48:49] inspired it was it was the same
[48:52] inspiration of the Holy Ghost that would
[48:55] strike the heart of a believer that
[48:57] inspires you in the word that inspires
[49:00] you to live a dedicated holy life that
[49:04] inspires you to separate from the world
[49:07] and all unbelief a church can't do that
[49:10] it takes God to do that you see this is
[49:14] this is where Abraham comes in to a
[49:17] place and it's after these things that
[49:20] we find as the scripture said and after
[49:23] these things this is
[49:25] after ishmail
[49:27] has been
[49:29] removed this is where ishma has been
[49:32] sent Hagar and Ishmael because you could
[49:35] not have them there together because
[49:38] ishmail was the one who now begin to
[49:41] jostle and tease and make fun of the
[49:45] very the very one Isaac listen this was
[49:48] not just a normal boy Isaac yes as far
[49:51] as in the flesh but to remember this was
[49:54] a supernatural promise
[49:57] that if it hadn't been for the
[49:59] intervention of almighty God Isaac
[50:02] wouldn't have been there
[50:05] amen amen it was
[50:09] Supernatural Isaac's birth how Isaac
[50:12] came into manifestation it was according
[50:15] to the promise now when after these
[50:18] things the separation has taken place
[50:22] there had to be a separating of the
[50:25] shock you know the shock itself and I
[50:27] say this just because maybe some newer
[50:29] younger ones the shuck itself is the
[50:32] last thing that holds to that seed in a
[50:34] wheat plant it takes seemingly the form
[50:38] of what what would we would say the seed
[50:41] and many can look and say oh the seed
[50:44] but remember the shu is not the seed
[50:47] It's the final stage before the seed you
[50:50] can see it more clearly you can see that
[50:52] life that brother BR said that something
[50:54] that moved all the way through the wheat
[50:57] plant but now it comes to a place that
[50:59] the Shu must give way that the seed can
[51:03] express and reveal itself it was
[51:07] necessary that the word itself would
[51:10] bring a separation with the Shu you see
[51:14] the Shucks hinder the seed right amen
[51:18] the Shu hinders the working of the sea
[51:21] this is why the word itself it can go
[51:24] forth it doesn't have an effect on
[51:26] anybody else others you know you could
[51:29] talk to others and they'll say oh yeah
[51:31] the church down the road they preach
[51:33] Jesus they miss it they miss entirely
[51:36] we're not talking about a historical God
[51:38] we're talking about what God's program
[51:41] was when he became flesh that that same
[51:44] God would come and manifest himself in a
[51:48] body of
[51:51] Believers there was a purchase made
[51:54] there was a claiming that was made that
[51:56] that he might come and live in his
[52:00] people
[52:02] amen so it's had to come to a place this
[52:05] is why even throughout the course of
[52:09] time and years we find the shock you
[52:12] find this one goes away this goes away
[52:14] Shu has to pull away because the seed is
[52:18] to declare or be fully declared
[52:23] amen now notice when it says the Lord
[52:27] and the scripture said he went unto the
[52:29] place that the Lord had told him of now
[52:33] you know we we look at sometimes we we
[52:35] can look at things and think well it was
[52:38] just just something of a of just word
[52:41] but remember Jesus here says in John
[52:45] 5:19 he said the son can do nothing but
[52:49] what he seeth the father doing amen you
[52:54] see Jesus was saying I I am here to act
[52:58] out what I see the father doing right
[53:02] the word moves and you begin to see it
[53:04] you can't explain it but you see God
[53:07] moving in your life and here you are
[53:09] yielding to that you're following that
[53:12] pattern that God desired to restore he
[53:15] shows you his word and you walk by faith
[53:19] and where you walking you're walking to
[53:21] and in the direction till my faith
[53:24] becomes sight amen like God makes you a
[53:28] promise of healing in your body let's
[53:30] bring it down very simple in a healing
[53:32] in your body and listen you can start
[53:35] out your faith my faith but we need
[53:38] God's faith to come behind our faith
[53:40] amen is that
[53:42] right and so we want to yield our faith
[53:45] and then within that then it comes to a
[53:48] place once it drops in your heart you
[53:50] might be riding your truck you might be
[53:52] on the job you might be in in you might
[53:55] be praying you might be sting here but
[53:57] it's God sovereignly doing it amen amen
[54:00] and when it comes to that place it's
[54:04] finished I don't care what doctor's
[54:06] Reports say it's done right and you're
[54:10] walking on and they'll say how can you
[54:12] say that how can you walk that way
[54:14] you're not walking by wishful thinking
[54:16] there's a certainty in your life you've
[54:19] got a straight direction of where you're
[54:21] going you're looking at it and saying
[54:23] God has spoken and this is what God has
[54:26] conf confirmed to me you are journeying
[54:28] by faith until your faith becomes
[54:32] sight in other words that promise you
[54:35] have seen it it has become something
[54:38] that is so took a hold of you you cannot
[54:40] even explain it when they say well how
[54:42] could this be or how could that be and
[54:44] you can say I don't know but I believe
[54:48] it hallu Hall faith is not something you
[54:52] can explain amen right a matter of fact
[54:57] faith when you can that's intellectual
[54:59] Faith but Faith itself is something that
[55:03] just stands right there and Against All
[55:06] Odds Faith said God said it it's
[55:11] finished Hallelujah he saw this mountain
[55:15] in a vision Hallelujah this was the
[55:19] final mountain in his journey come on
[55:22] somebody it was the final time you know
[55:25] in your journey you got valleys and
[55:27] mountains this was the final place in
[55:31] his journey it was not a valley it was a
[55:34] mountain
[55:36] right amen oh my I just don't want to
[55:39] get ahead of
[55:41] myself you see just as a Believer this
[55:45] is this is Simplicity of how God the
[55:48] Simplicity of how God would Quicken a
[55:51] promise to a Believer and you walk
[55:53] toward that promise think of it on as
[55:55] they before they came to the day of
[55:57] Pentecost remember they were ready to go
[56:00] back into their own ways but he came
[56:04] they were talking about him oh God help
[56:07] me this morning they were talking about
[56:09] him they didn't understand what they
[56:11] were saying and they couldn't figure out
[56:13] what had happened we thought he was to
[56:15] be the Redeemer but you see because
[56:17] there was a longing there was a cry for
[56:20] him to come and to reveal what these
[56:23] things are he stepped out
[56:29] he stepped out and he
[56:31] energized their faith
[56:35] Hallelujah yes Lord amen Peter's Faith
[56:39] failed him right are you with me but not
[56:43] after Pentecost brother amen amen are
[56:46] you with me he had the big brother
[56:48] behind his faith then woo Jesus
[56:52] Hallelujah standing right there in that
[56:55] promise
[56:56] he quickened to them the promise the
[56:59] Bible says in the Book of Luke they went
[57:02] to the upper room with
[57:05] joy yes amen they knew the promise was
[57:08] certain let me just say this to you
[57:10] right here if you've not received the
[57:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost the first
[57:14] thing you need to do is say God let the
[57:17] promises be made quick to me that that's
[57:20] my promise I'm telling you the devil
[57:23] will try to talk you out of it a Month
[57:24] of Sundays he try to run you this way
[57:27] and run you that way what should I do
[57:29] focus in on the promise and know the
[57:32] promise is not maybe not perhaps but the
[57:36] promise is repent be baptized in the
[57:39] name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[57:42] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's
[57:46] your
[57:47] promise Brother Sam you don't know how
[57:50] vile I am God didn't call you because
[57:52] you were good or because you were vile
[57:54] every one of us were and
[57:58] Rob sorry for being so plain but it's
[58:01] the truth God didn't call you and say oh
[58:04] God maybe call this guy this guy was a
[58:06] goody God don't call People based on
[58:08] that there was Nicodemus a man you
[58:11] couldn't touch his life and Jesus said
[58:13] you must be born
[58:15] [Applause]
[58:17] again in order to see the program of God
[58:21] so I say to you that promise is to you
[58:24] brother Brandon when he would have those
[58:26] as they're praying with others he said
[58:28] you have those as they're praying with
[58:30] others and you come there and you assure
[58:32] them you let them know this promise is
[58:34] for you the promise of the Holy Ghost is
[58:36] for you let me just say this to you you
[58:38] may not be in an altar right here
[58:40] because you don't have to be in an altar
[58:42] to receive the Holy Ghost amen come on
[58:45] now but let me tell you what God is
[58:47] doing God takes his word and he
[58:49] vindicates that word and he's speaking
[58:51] to you lift to ear and let you know this
[58:54] is the promise for you this is the
[58:55] promise is for you the Holy Ghost is for
[58:58] you this is for
[59:02] you Hallelujah he's the David in the
[59:06] camp that challenges the
[59:11] Goliath Hallelujah this is that promise

[59:16] Joel has spoke
[59:18] of see there were they went up there and
[59:21] the word that that had been spoken it
[59:24] gave them a vision when they went I
[59:28] remember they were kind of lingering
[59:29] around a little bit they were just
[59:33] watching and the
[59:36] angels what are you standing here
[59:39] looking at
[59:41] gazing that they didn't you know they
[59:43] didn't sprinkle pounded sugar on them
[59:45] they're letting them know you've seen
[59:47] him Ascend this same Jesus that you saw
[59:51] Ascend he will come again in like manner
[59:54] now go get ready for him is
[59:57] coming it one enough they could have
[59:59] stood there on that spot they could have
[1:00:01] built churches on that spot that is not
[1:00:04] the program of God the program of God
[1:00:07] he's going to come the same way what he
[1:00:10] first will come in clouds hallelujah
[1:00:13] amen is that right then that makes way
[1:00:16] for the Corporal coming and he lets them
[1:00:18] know go go and you must receive be
[1:00:22] endued with power from on high hallu
[1:00:28] they went with a
[1:00:29] certainty
[1:00:31] until faith became sight Hebrews
[1:00:36] 121 the Bible says
[1:00:39] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:00:42] about with so great a cloud of
[1:00:45] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:00:50] and the sin which death so easily beset
[1:00:52] us and let us run with patience
[1:00:56] the race that is set before
[1:01:00] us
[1:01:03] man let us lay aside every way
[1:01:06] something's slowing you down get rid of
[1:01:08] it if it's a bad attitude unload it
[1:01:10] right if it's a grudge unload it come on
[1:01:14] now if it's hurt unload it don't unload
[1:01:17] it on your on your
[1:01:19] neighbor don't unload it on somebody
[1:01:22] else cast your cares on him amen
[1:01:26] unload that weight it's slowing you down
[1:01:29] right the sin that does so easily in
[1:01:32] snare trap besets you lay it aside you
[1:01:36] see this is the authority looking at
[1:01:38] what God has done through the other
[1:01:40] Witnesses staying focused on that word
[1:01:43] you'll never get anywhere looking at
[1:01:44] your own
[1:01:46] self the word never come to have you
[1:01:49] focus on you the word come that you and
[1:01:52] I might be focused on him he's the one
[1:01:55] that we re receive strength
[1:02:00] from I agree that you first need to see
[1:02:02] that you ain't no count and you need you
[1:02:04] need help from God and may God help us
[1:02:06] as the prophet put it in perfect
[1:02:08] strength may we never rise above the
[1:02:11] dust of that Damascus
[1:02:14] Road amen because when we do God can't
[1:02:16] use us but I noticed this this the next
[1:02:19] p this next this is how we do it looking
[1:02:24] unto Jesus
[1:02:26] the author and finisher of our
[1:02:31] faith there ain't nothing that you can
[1:02:33] take credit for and say well I believed
[1:02:35] on the Lord I did this no even that to
[1:02:39] believe on the Lord is a gift of God
[1:02:42] amen
[1:02:43] amen God inspired your faith for that
[1:02:49] moment when God called Abraham out of
[1:02:52] the land of CH this is a supernatural
[1:02:54] calling
[1:02:56] it's a supernatural
[1:03:00] calling now think of this looking unto
[1:03:03] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[1:03:05] faith so where are we looking when we
[1:03:07] we're looking as we've read here before
[1:03:09] we're look with patience laying aside
[1:03:11] wait wait lay aside every sin that
[1:03:13] dother beset us and and run this race
[1:03:16] with patience with an endurance or as
[1:03:19] the Lord spoke to brother Andrew here on
[1:03:20] Thursday night an experience that holds
[1:03:23] out right amen
[1:03:27] we believe in Emotion I think God
[1:03:29] clearly even not only on Thursday but
[1:03:31] has been even expressing that listen we
[1:03:34] don't base our experience on emotion
[1:03:37] it's got to be a word experience amen
[1:03:40] it'll be there there's emotion that
[1:03:42] comes out of our life are you under are
[1:03:44] you with me but it's got to be something
[1:03:47] founded in the word this listen it
[1:03:49] wasn't God against this generation when
[1:03:51] he told him and when he said don't rest
[1:03:53] just because you preach don't rest just
[1:03:55] because you had a sensation don't rest
[1:03:58] he said just because you enjoyed the
[1:03:59] word but let it be to where your life
[1:04:02] has been so changed to where it's Christ
[1:04:05] on the inside of you than to where it
[1:04:09] puts you in the word hallelujah I'm tell
[1:04:13] you if somebody saying they're born
[1:04:14] again and they're not fully in the word
[1:04:16] they're not born
[1:04:18] again it's to be walking in the word for
[1:04:21] our
[1:04:23] day amen is to see the program of God
[1:04:30] hallelujah this is a time of finishing
[1:04:36] yeah Hallelujah looking unto Jesus man
[1:04:40] let me get to this looking this word
[1:04:43] look here oh I love this it means to
[1:04:46] consider
[1:04:50] attentive to turn the eyes away from
[1:04:55] other things hallelujah amen Jesus I
[1:04:58] want you to turn my eyes no he said you
[1:05:00] turn
[1:05:00] them from you turn the eyes away from
[1:05:04] other things a lot of things going to
[1:05:05] try and try to get you
[1:05:10] distracted turn your eyes away from
[1:05:13] other things and fix them on
[1:05:18] something this is where that our vision
[1:05:21] has got to become singular
[1:05:26] H Allelujah turning our eyes from things
[1:05:28] and becoming fixed on something the
[1:05:30] Bible said we have a more sure word of
[1:05:33] Prophecy and Peter under the inspiration
[1:05:37] admonishes where where you do well to
[1:05:40] take heed unto this word that God has
[1:05:45] Vindicated as a light in a dark place
[1:05:49] amen I tell you the world is a dark
[1:05:53] place amen
[1:05:56] yes when I say world I'm talking about
[1:05:59] religion I'm talking about
[1:06:03] churches
[1:06:05] Darkness Darkness is void of his
[1:06:10] life you see brother BR would say it
[1:06:13] like this he says we look for Christ to
[1:06:15] appear the same Jesus when he was on
[1:06:19] earth a little while in the world seeth
[1:06:20] me no more yet you shall see me for I'll
[1:06:22] be with you to the end of the world that
[1:06:24] same one who could direct the word and
[1:06:26] be the word and direct it right straight
[1:06:28] to the Target that same Lord Jesus is
[1:06:31] here this morning in the form of the
[1:06:34] Holy Spirit to direct our thoughts and
[1:06:38] focus down his word to one true and
[1:06:42] living God to one purpose to one
[1:06:45] achievement and if we'll just let him do
[1:06:49] it
[1:06:50] right he will focus the word right into
[1:06:54] a place that'll prove he's the same
[1:06:57] yesterday today and
[1:07:00] forever depends on what you want to look
[1:07:04] at
[1:07:06] right this is what I want to look at
[1:07:09] this is what I want to
[1:07:10] seeall we must focus our lives not what
[1:07:14] somebody else says but focus our lives
[1:07:17] to him and he is the word if we get our
[1:07:20] lives lined with the word then the word
[1:07:23] and our life becomes the same he said if
[1:07:27] you abide in me and my word in you then
[1:07:29] ask what you will it'll be granted to
[1:07:32] you you see what you'll be asking you'll
[1:07:33] be asking according to the word that's
[1:07:36] abiding in you and you in it
[1:07:39] amen he becomes the central focus of
[1:07:43] that life amen you know these glasses I
[1:07:49] had to go had to bite the bullet and go
[1:07:53] ahead and get bifocals or whatever you
[1:07:55] call call them they don't have the line
[1:07:56] in
[1:07:57] them cuz I got tired of reading medicine
[1:07:59] bottles like this or print or when I'm
[1:08:01] in my office immediately the glasses go
[1:08:04] off up here I take them off cuz I sweat
[1:08:05] but I would go off in my office and I
[1:08:07] read my Bible read my computer screen
[1:08:09] because I get tired of taking them on
[1:08:11] and off and this and that looking and
[1:08:12] everything else and these things you
[1:08:15] know as somebody told me before I didn't
[1:08:17] understand it they but the doctor told
[1:08:19] me he said here's the thing he said they
[1:08:21] not hard to get used to but you just got
[1:08:23] to remember what you want to look at you
[1:08:25] need to look at it you point your nose
[1:08:27] at it right he said because your
[1:08:29] peripheral you're not out of my
[1:08:30] peripheral anything getting a little bit
[1:08:32] over here it's it's I can't see it I
[1:08:35] have to stay it it's focused in here now
[1:08:38] when I look at that the peripheral
[1:08:41] sometimes and we understand you got to
[1:08:43] have peripheral when you're driving
[1:08:45] right come on now don't get technical on
[1:08:47] me now but sometimes it's the peripheral
[1:08:50] in our life that gets us
[1:08:53] distracted amen peripheral can come
[1:08:57] catch a little bit of glimmer of White
[1:08:59] Woo how big is that one are you getting
[1:09:00] you know there's Brown that's a dog you
[1:09:02] you know you start you catch a little
[1:09:04] bit of perimeter a peripheral and to
[1:09:06] take your eyes like my wife said get
[1:09:07] your eyes back on the road right you
[1:09:10] can't shoot them
[1:09:13] anyhow you see you see something out of
[1:09:15] the peripheral but this is where God
[1:09:18] would put you and ey this hour our life
[1:09:20] we're not walking out of the perfield
[1:09:22] sure we know things are going on but
[1:09:25] there's got to be such a focus in our
[1:09:27] life to our life is not dominated by
[1:09:30] what's happening in the world the
[1:09:32] peripheral but it is focused in on Jesus
[1:09:39] Christ
[1:09:43] Hallelujah like that young man he came
[1:09:46] up and he played man he played a a good
[1:09:48] piece on the Pian everybody
[1:09:51] standing
[1:09:53] oh that young man came mountain and he
[1:09:56] just stood there and his eyes was not

[1:10:02] straight
[1:10:03] up everybody what the guy's not even
[1:10:06] bowing or
[1:10:08] nothing but but then they asked him
[1:10:11] what's going on said I appreciate all
[1:10:13] those Applause he said but I didn't he
[1:10:16] said I'm not looking for your approval
[1:10:19] he said my master is standing in the
[1:10:21] balcony Hallelujah and I want to know
[1:10:23] what does he think
[1:10:27] yes what does he think
[1:10:31] Hallelujah if he abide in me and my word

[1:10:36] granted to you verily I say unto you if
[1:10:38] you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:10:40] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:10:42] that what you have said will come to
[1:10:44] pass you can have what you have said oh
[1:10:46] my not what I said what you said you can
[1:10:49] have because you and he become the same
[1:10:55] because the mind that was in Christ is
[1:10:58] in you and the mind that was in Christ
[1:11:01] was to fulfill the father's word
[1:11:06] amen if that's not your desire this
[1:11:09] morning then you need the mind of Christ
[1:11:15] amen which was the word there you are
[1:11:18] then you and the word are focused in
[1:11:20] together you become a living unit of God
[1:11:24] right how many know he's the high priest
[1:11:26] of our confession that means to say the
[1:11:29] same thing he's not just my high priest
[1:11:32] because oh I make mistakes no it's much
[1:11:34] much deeper than that amen the high
[1:11:36] priest is one who stands there
[1:11:38] ministering the sacrifice on my behalf
[1:11:41] this word that's coming forth our high
[1:11:43] priest is the one who is moving in the
[1:11:46] assembly he's touching our life he's
[1:11:48] energizing us to ask for those things
[1:11:52] that he's inspiring to our heart I want
[1:11:54] to fulfill the word of my
[1:12:00] father Matthew 6:21 where your treasure
[1:12:04] is there will your heart be
[1:12:06] also the Light of the body is the eye if
[1:12:10] therefore th eye be single somebody say
[1:12:13] single single thy whole body shall be
[1:12:16] full of light this word single means and
[1:12:19] it's derived with a union with the alpha
[1:12:24] it's to be United
[1:12:25] with
[1:12:27] God to where you're no longer two
[1:12:30] separate people amen amen to where the
[1:12:33] message is here and you're
[1:12:35] here come on now you come to church but
[1:12:38] you live a totally different
[1:12:40] life you say what do I need to do get
[1:12:43] United with the Lord Jesus Christ then
[1:12:46] it's no longer you living it but it's
[1:12:48] Christ Living it through you your every
[1:12:50] desire your every pulsation is to please
[1:12:53] him this is God's desire for our
[1:13:01] lives brother brand put it very clear
[1:13:04] and Christ is the mystery he
[1:13:07] said now God wants to get it so plainly
[1:13:10] to us he said but we
[1:13:14] we we get in the way he said we let so
[1:13:18] many other things take it away
[1:13:25] well I can do this and I you can't do it
[1:13:28] I'm not just talking to people who need
[1:13:29] the Holy Ghost I'm talking to every one
[1:13:31] of
[1:13:32] us I know sometimes it's easy you get a
[1:13:35] couple good weeks and a couple good days
[1:13:37] strung together and your flesh gets a
[1:13:38] little puffed I'm going to preach and
[1:13:42] you know what it's setting you up for a
[1:13:44] place for God to say your flesh ain't
[1:13:46] nothing this is not your
[1:13:49] work you are my
[1:13:53] workmanship Hallelujah we get the
[1:13:55] feeling good what does that do it
[1:13:57] tightens up and restricts the flow of
[1:14:01] God oh
[1:14:04] my God help us to stay yielded simple
[1:14:08] this is why the word here single it's
[1:14:10] the same word uh it's a word that we can
[1:14:13] also remember Paul said uh you know Les
[1:14:16] Satan would come and and remove from the
[1:14:19] uh the the the the Simplicity of the
[1:14:21] mind or the Simplicity that's in Christ
[1:14:24] you see to be simple means to present no
[1:14:29] difficulty man when I was in math class
[1:14:31] I likeed simple
[1:14:33] math I'm not much of a algebra guy sure
[1:14:36] wasn't much of a trigonometry or
[1:14:38] calculus guy if you're those kind of
[1:14:40] people God bless you when I need a job
[1:14:42] done for something like that I'll call
[1:14:43] you but that that that to me I didn't
[1:14:46] enjoy that but I like things that's
[1:14:49] simple the gospel is really simple God's
[1:14:53] desire is for our life to be very simple
[1:14:56] to present no difficulty
[1:15:01] hallelujah oh my no wonder Paul said I
[1:15:04] have to be simple
[1:15:06] daily I have to Die daily right right
[1:15:12] because you know we're not divided we're
[1:15:14] not to be divided but we're to be wholly
[1:15:16] devoted to him to the program of
[1:15:18] almighty God which has been identified
[1:15:21] by the holy ghost in the word you see
[1:15:23] when the scripture when it's when it
[1:15:25] expressly States arise and shine or Paul
[1:15:28] would write by inspiration thou that
[1:15:30] sleepest awake he would speak uh you
[1:15:33] know awake arise and Christ shall give
[1:15:34] thee light arise arise and shine it is a
[1:15:39] declaration of the word that is coming
[1:15:41] to bring light to light up the promise
[1:15:46] right to light up our lives with the
[1:15:49] word light and our lives that our lives
[1:15:51] would shine with the light of God which
[1:15:54] is his revealed
[1:15:55] will think of this the Bible says but if
[1:15:59] thine eye be evil thy whole body shall
[1:16:01] be full of Darkness if therefore the
[1:16:03] light that is in thee be Darkness how
[1:16:05] great is that Darkness how can Darkness
[1:16:08] how can light be
[1:16:10] Darkness because light is referred to
[1:16:14] understanding light John
[1:16:17] 1 his life was the
[1:16:20] light is that right right so if the
[1:16:24] understanding
[1:16:25] lean not to your own understanding if
[1:16:28] that life in you is evil it's still that
[1:16:31] old life oh it is complete
[1:16:37] darkness this is why there's got to be a
[1:16:40] change your body and my body when they
[1:16:42] take X-rays there's light in our bodies
[1:16:45] is that right but make sure the light in
[1:16:48] your body is not Darkness let the light
[1:16:51] meters of our life be surrendered to the
[1:16:55] shakina light the Holy Ghost God and God
[1:16:59] pushes these light meters in the right
[1:17:04] direction hallelujah it's a messiah
[1:17:07] Anointed with his Spirit moving in his
[1:17:12] word read another same portion of
[1:17:15] scripture from Luke no man when he
[1:17:18] lighted a candle putteth it in a secret
[1:17:20] place neither under a
[1:17:23] bushel but on a
[1:17:26] Candlestick that they which come in may
[1:17:29] see the light notice the candle was lit
[1:17:34] in order to be displayed right the
[1:17:37] candle itself is not what lights up the
[1:17:41] room it's the flame Hallelujah that has
[1:17:44] come upon the wet
[1:17:47] amen but the candle has a wick the
[1:17:50] candle has something that the fire is
[1:17:53] able to come and the Fire doesn't
[1:17:56] consume it but it gives light hallelujah
[1:17:59] amen and the Candlestick that we're
[1:18:02] talking of it's talking of that Gene
[1:18:05] seed of God that was in your life amen
[1:18:10] that was the
[1:18:12] place that the quickening power of God
[1:18:16] when God would light up the promise in
[1:18:18] this hour and say arise and shine he was
[1:18:22] calling to that place on the inside it's
[1:18:25] that place that is reserved for God it's
[1:18:28] that seed that soul that God comes in a
[1:18:32] temple not made with hands and God comes
[1:18:36] and SATs down on the throne of that
[1:18:39] life Hallelujah and he reflects his life
[1:18:43] through your life it's put on a
[1:18:48] Candlestick so that all might see the
[1:18:50] light Jesus said I am the light of the
[1:18:51] world as long as I am in the world
[1:18:55] right he ascended up and he sent back
[1:18:59] the same light that he was illuminated
[1:19:01] with oh Hallelujah notice verse 36 If
[1:19:06] thy whole body of Luke 11 be full of
[1:19:09] light having no part dark the whole
[1:19:11] shall be full of light as when the
[1:19:13] bright shining of a candle doth give
[1:19:15] thee
[1:19:17] light I may say God I want to be full of
[1:19:20] light
[1:19:22] Lord Proverbs 4:18 the path
[1:19:26] of the just is as The Shining Light that
[1:19:29] shineth more and more to the perfect
[1:19:35] day oh my I want I I want to I want to
[1:19:39] just lay this in in Matthew
[1:19:44] 24:17 for as the lightning cometh out of
[1:19:47] the East and shineth even unto the West
[1:19:51] so shall also the coming of the son of
[1:19:53] man be
[1:19:57] it's a quick lighting
[1:19:59] upall the word shine it means
[1:20:04] lightning
[1:20:05] shine it's to light up the coming of the
[1:20:09] son of man
[1:20:10] listen the world itself the
[1:20:14] world is not going to catch the Corporal
[1:20:17] coming right that is to the elect only
[1:20:26] now when he's coming back makes himself
[1:20:28] known to Israel this is where things
[1:20:31] will be able to be seen within that
[1:20:33] whole time of revealing this is why that

[1:22:29] piece when the Lord Jesus was here he
[1:22:31] set a time piece he said observe look at
[1:22:34] the fig trees when summer is drawing
[1:22:38] nigh he would tell us this is our time
[1:22:40] piece because why there's only a short
[1:22:43] allotted time to the Gentiles it was the
[1:22:47] mystery that Paul would speak of this is
[1:22:50] only for an alloted period of time where
[1:22:53] he calls out a people for his name's
[1:22:56] sake he takes his church his bride his
[1:23:00] wife unto
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:03] himself to where
[1:23:05] eventually that as we were grafted
[1:23:08] in the Gentile days would be over
[1:23:15] right now Revelations

[1:23:25] things I saw another Angel come down

[1:24:43] Earth was lightened with his glory watch

[1:25:08] the atonement has no weakness the Holy
[1:25:11] Ghost has no
[1:25:13] [Applause]
[1:25:16] weakness this is declaring the courage
[1:25:20] that God is bringing to the Church of
[1:25:22] the Living God and let me just announc
[1:25:25] it not is but has
[1:25:28] brought
[1:25:31] Hallelujah cried mightily with a strong
[1:25:35] voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen
[1:25:39] he's fallen and has become the
[1:25:41] habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:25:44] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[1:25:47] unclean and hateful bird you know what
[1:25:48] it is her Doctrine has gathered the
[1:25:52] harlots to her it's
[1:25:54] the ecclesiastical system it's gathered
[1:25:57] Every Nation every government unto
[1:26:00] itself
[1:26:03] Hallelujah she don't want somebody in
[1:26:05] she gets them out right are you with me

[1:26:11] yes
[1:26:12] amen she'll even take her own people out
[1:26:15] to advance the cause but she can't do
[1:26:18] nothing right unless God permits it to
[1:26:21] be done amen amen amen she don't even
[1:26:24] have her own military but can call bombs
[1:26:27] down hallelujah amen you with
[1:26:32] me you see these are things they are
[1:26:35] being united together listen God there
[1:26:38] were mortal enemies in the days of the
[1:26:40] Lord Jesus pilate and Herod those guys
[1:26:43] hated one
[1:26:45] another they hated one
[1:26:49] another like brother Ram talked about
[1:26:51] you had the
[1:26:52] Pentecostals come on David dessus in
[1:26:55] them they come over and sit next to the
[1:26:57] pope oh it's such a spiritual thing
[1:27:00] right really if it was spiritual you'd
[1:27:03] recognize what God has said in his word
[1:27:06] hallelujah but you see what people deem
[1:27:08] spiritual is their
[1:27:11] feelings this is where the world is at
[1:27:13] now it's all based on
[1:27:16] emotion this is why God had to send the
[1:27:18] word and say your experience is not
[1:27:21] based on emotion it must be grounded in
[1:27:25] the word am CU some days you're going to
[1:27:28] feel saved other days you're not going
[1:27:30] to feel saved but you got to know the
[1:27:32] ground you're standing
[1:27:37] on this is the standard against the
[1:27:40] enemy's
[1:27:42] blood prise
[1:27:44] God see how the enemy's tactic in
[1:27:47] subtility to draw you out in Emotion
[1:27:50] right we are not walking by emotion we
[1:27:53] walk
[1:27:54] by
[1:27:56] [Applause]
[1:27:57] faith Hallelujah this is why we need the
[1:28:01] compass and guide and the authority and
[1:28:04] the strength of the voice of the Holy
[1:28:06] Ghost we want to make sure everything's
[1:28:08] cleared out God I don't want that voice
[1:28:10] to be deadened in my life when it says
[1:28:13] turn here I want it to turn amen yes
[1:28:18] hallelujah we're not ignorant of Satan's
[1:28:22] devices for all nations have drunk of
[1:28:25] the wine of the wrath of her
[1:28:28] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[1:28:31] have committed fornication with her and
[1:28:33] the merchants of the Earth are waxed
[1:28:35] Rich through the abundance of her
[1:28:37] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[1:28:40] from
[1:28:41] Heaven are you with
[1:28:45] me come out of
[1:28:47] her my
[1:28:51] people come out of that Gathering that
[1:28:54] religious grouping that uniting that is
[1:28:57] a contrary to the word amen remember in
[1:29:01] the book of Isaiah and the spirit of God
[1:29:02] picks it up in Revelations they wanted
[1:29:04] to call this ah you know that this is a
[1:29:07] synagogue we are a gathering of God and
[1:29:10] the spirit of God said this is not my
[1:29:12] synagogue my Dwelling Place this is a
[1:29:14] synagogue of Satan amen amen I have not
[1:29:18] called for this assembly who has called
[1:29:20] for this assembly God calls for an
[1:29:22] assembly by his word his Spirit sounds
[1:29:26] out through the word to together the
[1:29:28] people to the word himself not to a
[1:29:31] church not to an idea not to a Creed
[1:29:35] that's powerless but he calls together
[1:29:38] under the blood there's where the power
[1:29:41] is there's where safety is
[1:29:45] hallelujah don't ever put your trust
[1:29:48] with your name on a book
[1:29:50] somewhere right if man can put it on
[1:29:54] then man can take it
[1:29:58] off but let where your name is wrote on
[1:30:01] the on God's book let that become a
[1:30:03] reality amen amen I heard another voice
[1:30:07] from heaven so he heard a voice crying
[1:30:09] strong voice this is the same strong
[1:30:12] voice in Revelations 5 I heard a strong
[1:30:16] Angel amen proclaiming worthy Hallelujah
[1:30:20] you wouldn't see
[1:30:21] amen and I heard another voice from
[1:30:23] heaven
[1:30:25] come out of her my people and ye be not
[1:30:27] partakers of her sin that you receive
[1:30:29] not her plagues we heard this voice
[1:30:31] brother Joy amen we heard this voice
[1:30:34] from Heaven God had a vessel brother
[1:30:36] Dave on Earth that he could sound that
[1:30:41] through you Lord hallelujah and brother
[1:30:44] brand picks that up he said what it is
[1:30:46] he said that angel messenger is so
[1:30:50] inclined with God to when he's speaking
[1:30:54] it's God speaking through
[1:30:57] him this is why we're not looking at a
[1:31:00] church we're looking unto
[1:31:05] Jesus we needed to know what we need to
[1:31:07] look
[1:31:08] at now if you're planning on being here
[1:31:11] in the tribulation go join the
[1:31:15] church but if you're looking at saying I
[1:31:18] want to leave here I want to be with him
[1:31:21] Hallelujah Glory I mean what lady what
[1:31:24] what real little lady she don't want to
[1:31:26] be she don't want to be married as far
[1:31:27] as after the proposal's been made in the
[1:31:29] engagement when it's really happened
[1:31:31] she's looking she's counting down the
[1:31:32] time right matter of oh my matter of
[1:31:35] fact her heart is already
[1:31:38] departed she's still there in body but
[1:31:41] their hearts are united in an invisible
[1:31:44] Union and pretty soon her body will
[1:31:47] catch up to the one her heart has been
[1:31:50] United
[1:31:52] with Glory
[1:31:54] [Applause]
[1:31:57] amen what are you following I'm
[1:31:59] following the voice of
[1:32:02] God it's in his bride
[1:32:07] amall I'm going to read these things he
[1:32:10] said when you see Israel putting forth
[1:32:13] its blood buds that's a great ins sign
[1:32:17] time is at hand when Israel becomes a
[1:32:19] nation she's a nation
[1:32:21] today we see all the things peace
[1:32:24] treaties and peace and all that the
[1:32:25] Bible says when they begin to Proclaim
[1:32:27] peace then cometh sudden
[1:32:31] destruction don't get you don't get
[1:32:33] caught in your peripheral stay
[1:32:37] focused
[1:32:40] amen hallelujah look at this but to we
[1:32:44] who look for Christ the second time it's
[1:32:46] an inside he's soon coming we see things
[1:32:48] fixing to happen depends on what you're
[1:32:49] looking at no one knew by the word of
[1:32:52] God there was coming a flood how many
[1:32:54] knows the Bible said in Hebrews 11 that
[1:32:56] Noah prepared an
[1:32:57] ark
[1:32:59] before God spoke to him before amen it
[1:33:03] had never
[1:33:04] rained upon the Earth right try to
[1:33:08] explain it he couldn't Noah himself was
[1:33:12] not motivated and inspired because he
[1:33:15] understood it it was
[1:33:19] inspiration that took a hold of his life
[1:33:21] as a matter of fact it was a paradox
[1:33:25] let me just put it to you plainly if you
[1:33:27] have want a man to build a house you
[1:33:28] wouldn't have hired
[1:33:31] Noah brother Samuel what are you saying
[1:33:34] he built an ark that wasn't his natural
[1:33:36] abilities amen he was a
[1:33:40] farmer right but God called him to do
[1:33:44] something that he couldn't rely on his
[1:33:47] own abilities God I'm not an engineer
[1:33:50] what about me same way with Moses
[1:33:55] talk talk to talk right Lord God said
[1:33:57] you're the one I want to carry my
[1:34:00] message cuz God didn't want formed words
[1:34:04] Hallelujah hall hallelujah amen he calls
[1:34:08] for a people that rely upon his
[1:34:14] [Applause]
[1:34:17] inspiration Hallelujah one of these
[1:34:19] mornings that inspiration is going to
[1:34:20] drop
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:27] paragraph 38 the church the bride that
[1:34:29] called out today knows that the coming
[1:34:31] of the Lord is at hand regardless of how
[1:34:34] much we've been able to go in and be
[1:34:37] able to progress and so forth splitting
[1:34:38] an atom sending a radar message to the
[1:34:42] moon and you read this next nine with me
[1:34:45] that y'all got it up there that means
[1:34:50] nothing to the believer
[1:34:53] brother Aaron I'm sure on your job
[1:34:55] there's some tools that maybe they've
[1:34:56] come up with maybe that has kind of
[1:34:58] helped your job out I know for your job
[1:35:01] you do accounting aren't you glad you
[1:35:03] don't have to worry about just with one
[1:35:04] of them what do they call them things
[1:35:05] where
[1:35:06] you oh yeah four beads five beads six
[1:35:08] beads aren't you glad it's more than
[1:35:10] just a
[1:35:11] calculator and a pencil and an eraser
[1:35:14] aren't you glad there's programs right
[1:35:16] so you got to check those programs those
[1:35:18] programs themselves they help you right
[1:35:22] there's advances there's advances even
[1:35:24] in Civilization that has helped
[1:35:27] us but it never never is to be something
[1:35:32] we become
[1:35:35] focused
[1:35:37] right be much easier to try to cut
[1:35:40] everything out but you need to have the
[1:35:42] Lord say Lord help me to reain amen help
[1:35:45] me to walk in a real
[1:35:49] balance that means nothing to the
[1:35:51] believer only a sign that the coming of
[1:35:54] the Lord is at hand we see Nations
[1:35:56] breaking and the Nations coming falling
[1:35:58] apart and the world coming apart and the
[1:36:00] church move coming apart then we are
[1:36:03] taught that we receive a kingdom which
[1:36:06] cannot be moved but as these things
[1:36:09] begin to happen the church binds itself
[1:36:14] together Tighter and
[1:36:17] Tighter by the word of
[1:36:21] God this is the admonition this is what
[1:36:23] the church
[1:36:24] does bind ourselves together tighter
[1:36:28] with the word of
[1:36:33] God you've heard it spoke right here I
[1:36:35] wasn't even the one standing here the
[1:36:37] past two services but we've been saying
[1:36:38] it all along stability and unstable
[1:36:40] times we are living right now in a
[1:36:44] situation in the nation it's a
[1:36:46] mess are you with
[1:36:48] me never before we see the the things
[1:36:51] that has taken place even since 1960 to
[1:36:54] this scale right this is why brother R
[1:36:57] when he would talk about that election
[1:36:59] he says we don't know who has won it but
[1:37:02] the focus was he said see there's no
[1:37:05] certainty in
[1:37:07] democracy what's the only thing that's
[1:37:09] certain a kingdom that cannot be moved
[1:37:12] Hallelujah this is our
[1:37:14] certainty when you see the things the
[1:37:17] things that are taking place and then
[1:37:19] you know we look at it but remember
[1:37:21] don't let your pereral catch you but
[1:37:24] stay focused say God help me to silence
[1:37:27] help me to put out all the peripheral
[1:37:29] let me stay focused Lord on
[1:37:36] you it really don't matter who they put
[1:37:38] in office it ain't going to hinder the
[1:37:40] program of
[1:37:41] God sure they might depending on who
[1:37:44] gets in things might come down on us
[1:37:46] things things will come around and
[1:37:47] everything else but you know what Satan
[1:37:49] can't stop the
[1:37:51] bride no sir
[1:37:54] he ain't going to turn the bride around
[1:37:55] the bride ain't going down brother you
[1:37:57] ain't going to close her up direct quote
[1:38:00] you ain't going to close her up she's
[1:38:01] going to be taken up you can't shut this
[1:38:06] work down this is not a work of
[1:38:10] man I'm talking about your life I'm

[1:38:16] work of
[1:38:18] man you're God's work hallelujah amen
[1:38:23] hallelujah amen and the move is on for
[1:38:26] the
[1:38:28] Bri titer to that word why because the
[1:38:31] word is the only sure Place
[1:38:35] amen well I know when Thanksgiving gets
[1:38:37] here mama's going to have sweet potato
[1:38:42] pie Brother David I happen just think
[1:38:44] about that I've seen you man sweet
[1:38:46] potato pie I didn't mean to call out
[1:38:47] like that but man his mom makes a good
[1:38:49] one but I'm talking about something
[1:38:51] that's more sure than sweet potato pie
[1:38:55] Thanksgiving I'm talking about something
[1:38:57] that's more sure I'm talking about
[1:38:59] something that's a reality that you can
[1:39:02] put your foot on you see if you look at
[1:39:04] it correctly of even what has been going
[1:39:06] on in the nation you recognize let my
[1:39:09] focus be solely on the
[1:39:12] Lord hallelujah man I want to preach
[1:39:15] here but
[1:39:23] that doesn't mean that you're not
[1:39:24] mindful let me just let me drop this
[1:39:26] here because I have to Pastor I'm not an
[1:39:28] evangelist I just can't
[1:39:31] run that doesn't mean that you put your
[1:39:34] head in the sand that doesn't mean that
[1:39:36] you pretend like nothing's going
[1:39:40] on brother B still said I'm an
[1:39:43] American I still say I'm an
[1:39:45] American right if you despise that you
[1:39:48] got
[1:39:50] problems I'm an American all her shame
[1:39:53] or her glory right are you with me that
[1:39:56] means there's things that look even
[1:39:57] within the midst of it even there's
[1:39:59] things that to be to be aware of what's
[1:40:01] going on but that ain't my focus right
[1:40:04] sure there's little things I got to do
[1:40:05] there's things I got to do it sometimes
[1:40:07] I don't like doing it I don't like
[1:40:09] nothing that takes my mind away from
[1:40:13] meditating in the word of God right I
[1:40:16] mean nothing right I like to be with God
[1:40:19] just staying right there whether I'm
[1:40:21] there in my office even when I leave my
[1:40:23] my office still being in tune just
[1:40:25] waiting on him to drop and bring other
[1:40:27] parts together cuz you're seeking the
[1:40:29] mind of God in these Services

[1:40:36] and other stuff like that nobody likes
[1:40:38] doing that right you know what I mean
[1:40:40] brother Greg these some of these times
[1:40:42] things we got to do you don't look
[1:40:43] forward and say oh man today is the day

[1:40:57] you see don't let it be your focus
[1:41:01] right how do you know what a person's
[1:41:03] focus is what do they talk
[1:41:07] about what becomes the center and theme
[1:41:11] of
[1:41:12] their
[1:41:15] talk everybody's looking for something
[1:41:17] paragraph 40 as a group of Believers
[1:41:21] today a together we want to fix our
[1:41:28] thoughts our principles and things upon
[1:41:32] the
[1:41:33] coming the Bible says in Hebrews
[1:41:36] 9:28 so Christ was offered to Bear the
[1:41:39] sins of many and unto them that look for
[1:41:46] him many were looking for him in the day
[1:41:50] when he came in his
[1:41:52] Humanity but but they weren't
[1:41:54] looking for him according to his
[1:41:59] word they had their
[1:42:02] ideas and they missed him he came in
[1:42:06] Simplicity standing right among them
[1:42:09] John said he's here
[1:42:11] now John said he's here now yet he had
[1:42:15] not been fully manifested but John said
[1:42:18] I'm so sure of the one that I met and
[1:42:21] what he told me he told it to me I'm
[1:42:26] looking he said he's right among you
[1:42:28] right
[1:42:29] now but then the day broke where John
[1:42:31] standing right there and John could say
[1:42:35] as he as here the Lord Jesus would begin
[1:42:38] to make his way through that Crow Cloud
[1:42:40] remember it was not Christian bookstore
[1:42:43] having a Halo having oh he had this
[1:42:45] Aurora about his head no not at all the
[1:42:48] Bible said he was a
[1:42:49] man acquainted with GED Charles no
[1:42:53] Beauty we should
[1:42:59] desire but when he came walking down
[1:43:01] there that
[1:43:03] day same one who spoke to John the same
[1:43:07] Pillar of Fire said
[1:43:09] speak say it declare it what was John
[1:43:14] doing
[1:43:16] resting Abraham's walking to the place
[1:43:19] that God had showed him what's he doing
[1:43:21] he's resting but about that Third Day
[1:43:23] the Bible says he
[1:43:25] lifted his eyes his eyes went from the
[1:43:31] plain to the
[1:43:33] mountain when you begin to see all these
[1:43:36] things come to pass lift up amen your
[1:43:39] head Hallelujah your Redemption draweth
[1:43:44] night for those that look for his coming
[1:43:47] shall he appear the second time
[1:43:53] without sin
[1:43:55] salvation let me have just about five
[1:43:57] more
[1:44:01] minutes Abraham just want to bring us to
[1:44:05] a place and we'll
[1:44:07] close Abraham was
[1:44:10] walking and
[1:44:13] expecting the supernatural to take
[1:44:19] place you see expectation it grows
[1:44:23] in our
[1:44:25] hearts Abraham brother Braham would say
[1:44:28] it like
[1:44:29] this he said
[1:44:31] Abraham kept himself in an
[1:44:35] atmosphere that he could
[1:44:41] recognize when those men came up walking
[1:44:44] they look like ordinary men how many men
[1:44:46] have come out that way this wasn't
[1:44:48] something like oh there's people that
[1:44:51] live in this area on the plains of mam
[1:44:54] oh they walked by there were people out
[1:44:57] there they passed by at different times
[1:45:00] but there was something different about
[1:45:04] these brother Bram said the reason
[1:45:07] Abraham recognized and Abraham did not
[1:45:10] say my
[1:45:12] lords he had the revelation of the
[1:45:15] godhead come on now right amen he knew
[1:45:19] who father son Holy Ghost is the same
[1:45:21] self person revealed the Redeemer above
[1:45:25] us redeeming coming down to be one of us
[1:45:27] and then coming back in us to reveal and
[1:45:31] manifest and Quicken redemption in our
[1:45:34] life same God he said my Lord capital L
[1:45:38] capital O capital r capital D he
[1:45:42] recognized behind that Veil who was
[1:45:45] there brother BR said he recognized it
[1:45:48] because he was kept himself in an
[1:45:51] atmosphere let you see why the devil
[1:45:54] wants to get you caught in the
[1:45:55] peripheral cuz you get out of the
[1:45:57] atmosphere
[1:45:59] right Joshua 1 speaks of staying in the
[1:46:02] right atmosphere am Psalms 1 speaks of
[1:46:05] staying in the right atmosphere amen oh
[1:46:08] brother the Samuel I wish I could just
[1:46:10] live here at this church why you can
[1:46:12] have something so much
[1:46:14] better you have something so much better
[1:46:16] we come here and together bring our
[1:46:18] licks of fire together but remember what
[1:46:20] what what is the Glorious atmosphere
[1:46:22] that you and I can live in the Paul said
[1:46:24] if we live in the spirit amen then let
[1:46:28] us also walk am in the
[1:46:34] spirit you see expectation itself it
[1:46:37] grows it should grow in our hearts
[1:46:40] becomes more positive more
[1:46:43] sure being focused in on that one
[1:46:46] promise and becoming one with the
[1:46:50] word see the miracle only became
[1:46:55] greater it's a
[1:46:57] rehearsal Abraham when he walk when he's
[1:46:59] walking here this
[1:47:01] day
[1:47:03] Abraham has been accumulating in his
[1:47:08] life see brother samel there's a lot of
[1:47:11] things Abraham could have accumulated I
[1:47:14] can read about
[1:47:18] it but those are things that Paul said I
[1:47:21] have learned
[1:47:24] we forget those things that are
[1:47:28] behind Abraham was walking in the
[1:47:33] word his vision his Focus didn't
[1:47:38] become it became
[1:47:42] more the peripheral was losing its
[1:47:47] whole he had a lot of peripher when he
[1:47:49] left the land of Shard brought his daddy
[1:47:51] with him right right brought his nephew
[1:47:54] with him a lot of peripheral perip what
[1:47:56] will they say I love my nephew that was
[1:48:00] a hard thing in Genesis
[1:48:02] 13 God knew it was so hard that God said
[1:48:05] I'm going to
[1:48:06] help I'm going to force a decision to
[1:48:10] where it shows the value of the word in
[1:48:12] your life are you with me God knows what
[1:48:15] he's
[1:48:17] doing God brought a decision brought a
[1:48:20] situation that Abraham made the choice
[1:48:23] of the word
[1:48:25] right
[1:48:27] separation it keeps on through Abraham's
[1:48:30] life it's focusing focusing think about
[1:48:32] I want you to think of this in Genesis
[1:48:36] 14 the Bible Abraham has just went down
[1:48:39] there took his trained servants and went
[1:48:41] down there and overtook all these kings
[1:48:45] that took over the king of Sodom and
[1:48:46] those other kings he went down there LED
[1:48:49] his trained servants and they whipped
[1:48:52] him
[1:48:53] and he recovered
[1:48:55] lot he comes
[1:48:57] back here's Abraham they didn't realize
[1:49:01] it this man's a king
[1:49:03] too he's a ruler too the word has
[1:49:07] brought him to a place of
[1:49:09] ruling are you with me he brought him
[1:49:11] into a place just like the word brings
[1:49:13] you into a
[1:49:15] place and in the midst of all these
[1:49:17] kings that are
[1:49:20] there Abraham ain't focused around on
[1:49:23] there let me see if I can get in good
[1:49:24] with this guy see if I can get in good
[1:49:26] with this guy good with this guy but
[1:49:28] here comes a test here comes a
[1:49:31] test imagine this a gold
[1:49:34] block here comes the king of
[1:49:38] Sodom
[1:49:41] Sodom
[1:49:44] OPP Abraham for all
[1:49:47] you would you have this and you got to
[1:49:50] discern whatever is being offered don't
[1:49:53] always call it this blessing I know this
[1:49:57] blessing is of god you better discern it
[1:49:59] right because what you might be calling
[1:50:01] a blessing might be
[1:50:06] trapped amen hello somebody you see he's
[1:50:10] offering him here Abraham here I want to
[1:50:14] thank you for all you've done I
[1:50:16] appreciate everything you've done you've
[1:50:18] done I tell you what Abraham you've done
[1:50:20] so much for this company you know I want
[1:50:22] to do I want to promote you to my
[1:50:24] rightand
[1:50:25] guy oh oh God is blessing me oh God is
[1:50:30] blessing
[1:50:31] me and then inside the package it
[1:50:34] says you'll never be able to come to
[1:50:37] church your mind will never be free to
[1:50:41] think on
[1:50:43] me see sometimes it's a simple little
[1:50:46] things this is why we need discernment
[1:50:48] amen don't call everything that seems
[1:50:52] good good that's right that's right
[1:50:55] there's only one that's good and that is
[1:50:58] God we only want to accept that amen
[1:51:03] which comes from God because whatever
[1:51:05] comes from God remember what he said
[1:51:08] Genesis
[1:51:10] 12:1 I will bless you and you will
[1:51:17] beess and
[1:51:20] Abraham told the king of
[1:51:24] Sodom I don't want he said I won't even
[1:51:28] take
[1:51:30] shoeless
[1:51:32] right I won't even take something that
[1:51:35] even would seem
[1:51:38] Minister you know
[1:51:40] why Abraham's purpose was not for
[1:51:46] re his objective his motive was for his
[1:51:51] Fallen
[1:51:58] and all of that he was tempted come face
[1:52:01] to face he focused
[1:52:05] there when he when that was focused
[1:52:08] out in the midst all of these Kings
[1:52:11] think of these all this that was going
[1:52:13] on these Kings in their groups and my oh
[1:52:17] my well I thought we was a goner I
[1:52:18] thought we was this but in the midst of
[1:52:22] all of that
[1:52:27] he slips right in you do not recognize
[1:52:30] or do not read where the other kings
[1:52:33] stopped him or recognized him you do not
[1:52:37] read that the rest of them said oh here
[1:52:39] comes MDC yet he was the greatest
[1:52:46] King the Bible says in Hebrews 7 being
[1:52:49] first interpreted king of righteousness
[1:52:52] right are you with me this this mezc
[1:52:55] priest king and priest of that City who
[1:52:57] was it
[1:52:59] God
[1:53:01] God he would come down and make himself
[1:53:04] known right through the midst of Lady OA
[1:53:08] right through the midst of all the kings
[1:53:10] and riches was there in such a way but
[1:53:13] Abraham was so
[1:53:15] focused you see his objective in the
[1:53:17] beginning he's focused Here and Now from
[1:53:21] MZ brother Aaron he gives to him what's
[1:53:26] need
[1:53:31] bread he recognizes who mzc is he gives
[1:53:35] him a tenth of
[1:53:37] all a tenth of all time he recognizes
[1:53:42] who he is why don't he give that to the
[1:53:44] rest of the
[1:53:45] Kings this is speaking something so much
[1:53:48] different that tenth is to recognize
[1:53:51] who's the greatest king among
[1:53:53] yes the rest of them were Kings but this
[1:53:56] is the great king
[1:53:57] Hallelujah and he recognized it he gave
[1:54:00] a tenth what does that speak of the
[1:54:03] surrendering of our
[1:54:05] life he just don't want our mind he just
[1:54:07] don't want your body he just don't want
[1:54:09] your spirit he wants your
[1:54:12] soul that is the tenth and the tithe of
[1:54:15] the Lord when that gets brought into the
[1:54:18] storehouse of the
[1:54:20] Lord in him by the Holy Ghost there's a
[1:54:24] quickening and the rest of your life
[1:54:27] becomes an offering Hallelujah you want
[1:54:29] the en ties and offerings you want to
[1:54:31] offer the rest of your life amen you
[1:54:35] freely give it you could take this
[1:54:38] direction you could take that attitude
[1:54:40] you could let this build up but you
[1:54:42] offer it up Lord I don't want that in I
[1:54:45] don't want that in
[1:54:47] M let's just stop
[1:54:54] Supernatural say to you this
[1:54:57] morning we're living there's no doubt
[1:54:59] we're
[1:55:00] living in the closing of
[1:55:04] time now if that scares you then you
[1:55:07] need you need to get ready to go right
[1:55:11] so because we are to live in a place of
[1:55:13] being ready at all times because there's
[1:55:15] not one person here I don't care how old
[1:55:18] you are or how young nobody is promised
[1:55:21] tomorrow
[1:55:23] I don't care what kind of bill of health
[1:55:25] you
[1:55:25] got nobody's promis
[1:55:28] tomorrow let me just say it to you like
[1:55:31] this why wouldn't you want to live your
[1:55:36] life and that his life would be lived
[1:55:41] through
[1:55:42] you there's not one of us in here it's
[1:55:45] not brother Samuel can live this
[1:55:47] Christian
[1:55:48] Life it takes Christ to come
[1:55:52] he's the one that had to
[1:55:54] change my nature oh I tried
[1:55:59] tried TR youth camps go for a little bit
[1:56:04] fall off the wagon you know why that was
[1:56:06] my
[1:56:07] efforts I
[1:56:09] needed him to come but you realize what
[1:56:13] what kept him
[1:56:15] away me my
[1:56:19] trying you're trying you're trying to
[1:56:22] serve him kept you away kept him away
[1:56:24] yeah because it was my
[1:56:28] efforts but once it come to a place
[1:56:32] where I become
[1:56:33] dead Abraham could father children to a
[1:56:36] certain place but then the Bible says
[1:56:39] Not only was Sarah's wom
[1:56:40] did his stream of Life
[1:56:45] DED that was when the
[1:56:50] miracle see God Satan wants to complish
[1:56:54] God makes it so
[1:56:56] simple not only is that of the new birth
[1:56:59] very simple it's a surrendering and a
[1:57:02] consecrating of our life remember what
[1:57:05] we read here under inspiration it's
[1:57:07] letting him focus our lives into
[1:57:12] them let the peripheral let everything
[1:57:15] else will so and so might say this or
[1:57:17] say let that be focused out just focus
[1:57:19] it into the word of what the word is
[1:57:21] calling you
[1:57:25] with that in our
[1:57:27] life with that new
[1:57:30] birth there comes a focus in our
[1:57:33] life it comes
[1:57:35] a part in our life as we see with
[1:57:37] Abraham this was not just a this is not
[1:57:40] a story it's a
[1:57:43] prophecy it's a journeying in our life
[1:57:47] chapters that are in our
[1:57:49] life Abraham could have never walked to
[1:57:52] Mount
[1:57:52] Mariah in Genesis
[1:57:56] 22 if he had not accepted
[1:58:00] Grace all the
[1:58:04] way change you understand he's walking
[1:58:08] to mount Mariah with the
[1:58:12] supernatural every time he looks over at
[1:58:16] Isaac God's fa keeps walking
[1:58:22] comes over and maybe
[1:58:24] just grabs his hand squeezes eyes
[1:58:28] again come around again they just get
[1:58:31] over there and just hug Isaac and know
[1:58:34] brother he'll get over again squeeze his
[1:58:37] hand I saying I love you too Dad I love
[1:58:40] you too but Abraham what Abraham is
[1:58:43] doing he's
[1:58:45] encouraging S as he's walking to
[1:58:49] Mountain Fire what's he encouraging
[1:58:52] himself
[1:58:54] in the
[1:58:56] word the supernatural working of God
[1:59:00] that he knows this is not my
[1:59:04] imagination this is not what I've
[1:59:06] imagined this is
[1:59:09] tangible this is
[1:59:12] substance
[1:59:14] Supernatural he's looking
[1:59:16] superal
[1:59:19] so let all of our let the
[1:59:26] per tasks that we have to do we we we
[1:59:28] stated that but yet don't let the task
[1:59:30] become your focus but let your
[1:59:33] declaration be I'm a pilgrim I'm a
[1:59:36] stranger Hallelujah that's how I'm
[1:59:38] living my life I'm just passing
[1:59:43] through my
[1:59:45] focus is on
[1:59:47] him my focus is on his coming my f focus
[1:59:53] is on the
[1:59:55] Rapture just like you you sisters you
[1:59:57] have to think about at times whether you
[1:59:59] want to or not you got to plan at your
[2:00:00] grocery list you see what I'm saying
[2:00:02] little simple things you have to think
[2:00:03] about what are we going to have for this
[2:00:05] or what are we going to do for there
[2:00:06] what are we going to do for and things
[2:00:07] you have to think about but you see
[2:00:08] those are things and cares in this life
[2:00:11] remember what Jesus said to to Martha I
[2:00:13] believe it is or Mary whichever one it
[2:00:15] was you understand you're so cumbered
[2:00:18] with things don't become cumbered sure
[2:00:22] you have to do certain things sure at
[2:00:23] times you're going to have to put pain
[2:00:24] on your walls sure you know Brothers
[2:00:27] sometimes we have to repair certain
[2:00:29] things in our house but it doesn't
[2:00:31] become our
[2:00:33] Focus let our Focus be on
[2:00:37] him Simplicity of just staying in that
[2:00:39] atmosphere
[2:00:40] let's
[2:00:43] father Lord I I
[2:00:46] just just so thankful God for your
[2:00:50] mercy Lord
[2:00:52] we are nothing without
[2:00:56] you if it wasn't for
[2:00:59] you Lord he would pass right by
[2:01:04] us it wasn't us
[2:01:06] recognizing the reality of Lord It's you
[2:01:09] coming and inspiring us to
[2:01:12] recognize
[2:01:14] you think how your Prophet put it so
[2:01:17] simple he said it's God in you believing
[2:01:20] his own word
[2:01:24] oh
[2:01:25] God help us
[2:01:28] Lord father no matter where Lord a
[2:01:31] person might be this
[2:01:34] morning Lord I pray that if the enemy
[2:01:36] has so complicated things in their
[2:01:39] life maybe it's things Lord that your
[2:01:42] God
[2:01:44] is just so complicating as though that
[2:01:47] it's things that well they've got to do
[2:01:49] and I got to stop this and I got to may
[2:01:51] they Lord just
[2:01:53] see through your word you are focusing
[2:01:55] them into
[2:01:57] you and as the scripture would admonish
[2:01:59] us laying aside weight lay aside every
[2:02:01] sin that does let easily beset us let us
[2:02:04] run this race with patience
[2:02:06] looking you can't run a race looking at
[2:02:09] your
[2:02:10] feet you can't run a race looking at the
[2:02:15] sidelines you can't run a race looking
[2:02:18] behind you you run it looking unto
[2:02:24] Jesus Look to
[2:02:26] Him focused into a reality that would
[2:02:30] call you into a place of a real adopted
[2:02:33] son and daughter
[2:02:35] of and if you're there this morning you
[2:02:38] have that ground to stand
[2:02:44] [Music]
[2:02:45] on and let let your life let it remain
[2:02:49] focused things will come to try to
[2:02:52] distract maybe things come to try to
[2:02:57] dull emotions and other types of things
[2:03:00] will
[2:03:00] come but
[2:03:03] remember Abraham himself was not a
[2:03:07] person who was a superhuman
[2:03:09] being he was a man subject to like
[2:03:12] passions such as we
[2:03:14] are but
[2:03:16] Abraham
[2:03:18] focused his life by the word
[2:03:22] into the program of God that
[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:31] hour I wonder if we just couldn't say
[2:03:35] Lord I want to stay attracted Lord I
