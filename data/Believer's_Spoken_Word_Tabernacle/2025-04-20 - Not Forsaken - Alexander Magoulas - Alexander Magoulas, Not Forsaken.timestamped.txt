[37:30] of life that he's given us. Amen. We
[37:33] just thank you, Lord, today.
[37:36] Lord, we're here today because you're
[37:38] holy, Lord.
[37:40] and you've made a declaration over us
[37:42] that we would be holy and accepted in
[37:45] the beloved. We're so thankful today.
[37:47] Would you just pray with me this
[37:48] morning? Father, we thank you today. We
[37:51] cry out with the angels, holy, holy,
[37:53] holy is the Lord God Almighty. Holy,
[37:57] holy, holy. The earth is filled with
[38:00] your glory. Lord, we we worship you. We
[38:03] thank you today, Lord. Lord, you're
[38:06] worthy of all the praise we could ever
[38:08] give. Lord, you made a way for us when
[38:10] there was no way. Lord, we thank you
[38:13] today in our darkest trial, in our
[38:16] darkest hour. Lord, we we can look and
[38:18] recognize, Lord, that that joy comes in
[38:21] the morning. That there's an empty grave
[38:24] today that bears witness that because
[38:27] you live, we shall live also. We live
[38:29] today.
[38:31] Lord, you're not far, but you're near
[38:32] unto us. In you, we live and move and
[38:35] have our being. Lord, we give you the
[38:37] praise now. We just ask you come bless
[38:39] the remainder of this service. Lord,
[38:41] you're so near to us right now. Lord,
[38:43] we're we're very aware of your presence
[38:45] with us. And we just we want to cherish
[38:47] the time. Redeem the time. Lord, we we
[38:49] see the world's fallen apart. Lord, we
[38:52] see the signs of the time all around us.
[38:54] But we are aware that we have received a
[38:56] kingdom which cannot be removed. And we
[38:59] are not just citizens of that kingdom,
[39:01] but parts of the family of God. Lord,
[39:03] we're so thankful to be your dear
[39:05] children today. Bless this time we pray.
[39:07] Bless the reading of your word and the
[39:08] ministering thereof. Lord, you're
[39:10] mindful of your children today, Lord.
[39:12] The scripture you've declared that you
[39:14] know our frame that we're but dust. You
[39:16] you pity us as you do small children,
[39:18] Lord. We're so thankful today that you
[39:20] are mindful of every situation and of
[39:23] every trial that each one of us is going
[39:25] through today, Lord. And we we can trust
[39:27] you with our tomorrow. We can trust you
[39:29] with our lives and our hearts and our
[39:31] souls. And we just we give you the
[39:34] praise now. We ask, we invite you. We
[39:36] welcome you to come and have preeminence
[39:38] in this place. In the name of the Lord
[39:40] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. God bless
[39:43] you. It's certainly good to be with you
[39:45] here today once again. And we just count
[39:48] it a privilege. I want to greet you all
[39:50] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:52] Before I take my scripture this morning,
[39:54] do we have any first-time visitors?
[39:56] Anybody new here? Is there anybody
[39:57] that's their first time? Okay. I just
[39:59] want to make sure it's Easter and
[40:01] sometimes people show up and and uh you
[40:03] know sometimes you know as message
[40:06] believers we we start preaching a
[40:07] certain thing and people are like what
[40:08] are you talking about? So you know I I
[40:11] try to be very aware as a minister that
[40:13] that people know where I'm coming from.
[40:15] So you know if I say something about an
[40:16] eagle belt buckle you all know what I'm
[40:18] talking about. But the average person
[40:20] would be like you're nuts. So uh just uh
[40:23] just if we have any visitors we just
[40:25] want to welcome you and uh greet you all
[40:27] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:28] What a what a what a nice day we have
[40:30] today. Amen. I tell you what, the sun's
[40:33] out, the sun's up. It's uh it's a good
[40:35] time. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we just
[40:38] are real blessed to be with you. Um if
[40:40] you have your Bibles this morning, I'd
[40:41] invite you to turn with me to the book
[40:43] of St. John the 20th
[40:47] chapter. And uh since you all are
[40:49] familiar with the scripture, I can I can
[40:51] save you a few minutes here. This is one
[40:53] of the stories of the resurrection, of
[40:55] course, that you're probably all
[40:56] familiar with. And uh I actually want to
[40:58] start in the 10th verse just for the
[41:00] sake of time. This is after uh Mary
[41:03] Magdalene. She comes to the suppler. She
[41:05] sees it's empty. The stone's been rolled
[41:06] away. Of course, Simon Peter and John,
[41:08] they run to the tomb. They check it out.
[41:10] It's empty. They they realize it's not
[41:13] there. And so after all that takes
[41:16] place, the Bible says this in verse 10.
[41:20] It says, ' Then the disciples went away
[41:22] again unto their own home. But Mary
[41:24] stood without at the suppler weeping.
[41:28] And as she wept, she stooped down and
[41:31] looked into the supplicer, and seeth two
[41:33] angels in white sitting, one at the
[41:36] head, and the other at the feet where
[41:38] the body of Jesus had lain. And they say
[41:41] unto her,"Woman, why weepest thou?" She
[41:44] saith unto them, because they have taken
[41:46] away my Lord, and I know not where they
[41:48] have laid him. And when she had thus
[41:51] said, she turned herself back, and saw
[41:54] Jesus standing, and knew not that it was
[41:58] Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why
[42:00] weepest thou? She's probably think, I
[42:02] just answered
[42:03] that. You had to have heard the
[42:07] answer. Woman, why weepest thou? Whom
[42:09] seekest thou? Notice she supposing him
[42:13] to be the gardener saith unto him, "Sir,
[42:16] if thou hast borne him hence, tell me
[42:19] where thou hast laid him, and I will
[42:21] take him away." Jesus saith unto her,
[42:24] "Mary." She turned herself, and saith
[42:28] unto him, "Raboni," which is to say,
[42:30] "Master." Jesus saith unouch me not, for
[42:34] I am not yet ascended to my father. Go
[42:38] to my brethren and say unto them, I
[42:41] ascend unto my father and your father
[42:45] and to my God. Your God.
[42:49] Mary Magdalene came and told the
[42:51] disciples that she had seen the Lord and
[42:53] that he had spoken these things unto
[42:57] her. Then the same day at evening being
[43:00] the first day of the week when the doors
[43:01] were shut where the disciples were
[43:02] assembled for fear of the Jews came
[43:04] Jesus and stood in the midst and said
[43:08] I'm sorry and saith unto them peace be
[43:11] unto you. May the Lord bless the reading
[43:13] of his word. You may be seated. Um uh
[43:16] you know sometimes I get up here and I
[43:18] tell on myself and that seems like a
[43:20] dangerous thing but uh you know uh
[43:23] brother Brandham if I've ever seen a
[43:25] preacher that tell himself it's brother
[43:26] Brandham. Amen. I I appreciate a man
[43:28] that'll get up there and be like, "Man,
[43:30] I struggle with this complex and this
[43:31] and that." And Brother Brand was
[43:32] probably about as honest as any of us.
[43:34] Amen. So, uh I'm just going to go here,
[43:36] but uh I I preach another sermon a lot
[43:39] of times. Sometimes uh uh I I'll go
[43:41] places on Easter and preach and I preach
[43:42] a sermon. I'm going to touch on it for
[43:44] just a few moments, but I'm not
[43:45] preaching it this morning. But I
[43:46] preached this sermon called Forsaken.
[43:48] and and for the background of it to lay
[43:50] this out what it was is years ago uh I
[43:53] was going to the home church there on a
[43:55] Sunday and brother Ray Ericson of course
[43:58] there was only like two of us at the
[43:59] time so a lot has changed since then but
[44:01] uh brother Ray asked me to preach on
[44:02] Easter Sunday and of course I'm just a
[44:04] boy preacher at the time and I was like
[44:06] yeah I'm going to preach Easter Sunday
[44:08] as if that was somehow more spe you know
[44:10] how how it is when you're young you know
[44:11] you got all these so just but I'm just
[44:14] telling myself so you know I I really
[44:16] set out I'm like I'm going to really
[44:17] study for this and get ready and I had
[44:19] plenty plenty of time to get ready. I
[44:21] had weeks, so it wasn't like I just
[44:23] found out the night before or something.
[44:24] So, I'm getting ready for the sermon and
[44:26] I'm studying and and uh you know, I
[44:28] don't know if you've ever been here or
[44:29] not, but you're looking at a certain
[44:30] thing. You're looking for an answer from
[44:31] the Lord and you you you give yourself
[44:34] to it. You apply yourself and you're
[44:35] just seeking the Lord and you're looking
[44:37] at this, you're looking at that. So, I
[44:38] study this and I listen to that. And I'm
[44:40] not saying that boastfully making a
[44:42] point. I I really tried I you know,
[44:45] brother Paul, I'm really like, man, I'm
[44:47] going to give myself this. And the more
[44:49] I sought the Lord on it, the more I
[44:51] tried to find the answer. What am I
[44:53] going to preach? The more I was
[44:54] confused. I'm I'm listening like going
[44:56] on be beyond the camp and all this other
[44:57] stuff. Like, Lord, why am I going
[44:59] through all this? And so, as you can
[45:01] imagine, this uh this became concerning
[45:03] to me by Sunday
[45:07] morning. I mean, I was up late Saturday.
[45:09] I'm I'm I probably got a few gray hair
[45:11] like you. So, I'm just telling you what
[45:13] I'm going through. I was really
[45:14] distraught. I'm like, what am I going to
[45:16] preach? I have no idea. And I'm going to
[45:17] get up there Sunday morning. I'm going
[45:19] to look like the biggest idiot. They're
[45:20] like, this guy ain't called, you know,
[45:22] what's he doing. The guy's known for
[45:25] weeks and this is all he ain't got
[45:26] nothing on the paper even to look at.
[45:28] and and my wife, she was driving to
[45:30] church, as she does many times from when
[45:32] I'm getting ready to preach, but she was
[45:33] driving Sunday morning and I'm looking
[45:35] out the window and I'm thinking to
[45:36] myself, and maybe you can identify with
[45:38] this part. I'm thinking to myself, I'm
[45:40] going to look like the biggest idiot.
[45:42] Amen. I'm going to get there. I'm going
[45:44] to have nothing to say. Uh I've I've and
[45:47] I begin. You know how you do? You feel
[45:49] bad for yourself. Lord, I've tried. I've
[45:51] prayed and I've studied. I've done
[45:54] everything I know how. I done everything
[45:56] I know what to do. And I I've tried and
[45:59] yet here I am and I'm just as helpless
[46:01] as can be. I'm just as incapable as can
[46:04] be. And I I I be I become very upset
[46:07] about the whole thing. Not at God, but
[46:09] just get my jacket off here cuz I know I
[46:10] ain't going to stay on anyway. But um I
[46:12] become very upset. I said, "Lord, I I
[46:14] feel I feel like you've abandoned me.
[46:17] This is like when I really need help and
[46:20] I feel abandoned. I feel like you're not
[46:22] there. I feel like an orphan child." You
[46:24] ever feel that way? You're you you you
[46:25] you really it's something real
[46:27] important. Amen. I you get something in
[46:29] your life. It's like, man, this is
[46:30] really important and it seems like
[46:32] that's when sometimes God is so far
[46:34] away. When it's the worst looking
[46:37] situation, like this is when I need him
[46:39] the most. And it seems like sometimes
[46:41] that's when he's not there. And I begin
[46:44] to pray and I said, "Lord, I I feel I
[46:47] feel like you've abandoned me. I I need
[46:49] you." I said, "Lord, I feel forsaken."
[46:52] And I thought I was praying. And I said
[46:53] that word forsaken. I feel forsaken. And
[46:56] the Lord spoke to me right there on the
[46:59] way to church. And he said,
[47:01] "Good. That's exactly what I wanted you
[47:04] to feel. That's what I was waiting for."
[47:07] Of course, I'm just like, "What? What do
[47:09] you mean?" And the Lord was speaking to
[47:10] me about this. Said, "Listen, I wanted
[47:12] you to realize what it's like to feel
[47:15] forsaken because that's how it was on
[47:17] the cross."
[47:19] Amen. We We take Easter for granted.
[47:22] Amen. We we've got our Easter vest on.
[47:25] We've dressed up. We get to see people
[47:26] at church. But we don't realize, you
[47:28] know, it's like a man training like Paul
[47:30] talks about striving for masters.
[47:32] There's a lot of work that took place.
[47:34] There's a lot of hardship that's behind
[47:35] that. There's a lot of suffering. Amen.
[47:37] It's not just ministry, but our lives.
[47:39] Amen. We come here and we see each other
[47:42] with bright smiles on and we feel good
[47:44] and Christ is risen. But there's a lot
[47:46] of stuff that went on behind the scenes.
[47:48] There's a lot of tears and sleepless
[47:50] nights and hardship. Amen. And sometimes
[47:53] you feel like that, man. I feel like an
[47:55] orphan child. I feel like I'm I'm not
[47:58] getting anywhere. It feels like you
[47:59] struggle some days just to keep your
[48:01] head above water. Amen. Well, hopefully
[48:03] I'm not the only one that feels that
[48:04] way. If I am, I guess you pray for me.
[48:06] You pray for the preacher then. Amen.
[48:08] But I felt so forsaken. And that's what
[48:10] he wanted me to get to that place. I
[48:12] want you to realize that's what I was
[48:15] waiting for. and said, "That's what I
[48:16] want you to feel because that's what I
[48:18] want you to preach and remember that we
[48:20] celebrate Easter because the father
[48:22] forsook his own son on the cross 3 days
[48:25] prior. There'd be no resurrection
[48:27] without a crucifixion." Amen. There be
[48:30] no uh resurrection if he hadn't been
[48:32] forsaken for our sakes. Amen. And what's
[48:35] amazing to me, Christ is not just
[48:37] forsaken by religious people. He's
[48:39] forsaken by friends. He's forsaken by
[48:41] the Jews. He's forsaken by the Romans.
[48:44] He comes to his own and his own received
[48:46] him not.
[48:48] But on top of all that, Amen. On top of
[48:51] all that, that's bad enough. But on top
[48:53] of all that, he's forsaken by the father
[48:56] himself. As he hangs on the cross, he
[48:59] fulfills the scripture. My God, my God,
[49:03] why hast thou forsaken me? Amen. I
[49:07] talked to a brother about this years ago
[49:09] about the severity of Christ's
[49:10] sacrifice. You know, we think about his
[49:12] broken body and his shed blood. We take
[49:14] the Lord's supper. We look at the nail
[49:16] scars. We remember all these things.
[49:18] Amen. But the greatest tragedy that
[49:20] Christ endured was separation.
[49:24] Amen. We all bypassed the theophony to
[49:27] be here today. Amen. We We don't
[49:29] remember anything. Amen. When God asked
[49:32] Job the question, "Where were you?" Job
[49:34] didn't remember. But God remembered.
[49:36] Where were you when the morning stars
[49:37] sang together and the sons of God
[49:39] shouted? See, you don't remember that.
[49:41] You were there, but you don't remember.
[49:43] But God remembers. God knows what you
[49:46] look like in the beginning. That's how
[49:48] he knows what you're going to look like
[49:49] in the end. See, we're the ones worried
[49:52] about it. He knows how it's going to
[49:53] turn out. The beginning and the end look
[49:55] the same to him. Amen. There's there's
[49:57] no learning for him. Amen. So, here
[50:00] comes Christ. And listen, Christ, he
[50:02] didn't bypass the theophony like you and
[50:04] I did. He remembers a time when Abraham
[50:08] saw his day and he rejoiced. He
[50:11] remembers a time when I had glory with
[50:13] the father in the beginning and he would
[50:15] pray, "Father, glorify them with the
[50:17] glory that we had together in the
[50:18] beginning." Jesus remembers a time when
[50:21] he beheld Satan fall from heaven like
[50:23] lightning. Amen. He is aware of where
[50:26] he's come from. He is aware of his
[50:28] purpose. He's there with both eyes open
[50:30] like Adam in the beginning. He's not
[50:32] deceived. He's not. He knows what's
[50:34] going on. He realizes what's taking
[50:37] place. And so when he goes to
[50:38] Gethsemane, when he's preparing to go to
[50:40] the cross, he knows exactly what his
[50:42] purpose is. Amen. He remembers where
[50:44] he's come from. And he has never been a
[50:46] time, there's never been a time in his
[50:48] life where he was separated from the
[50:50] father. He's remembered everything. It's
[50:53] been there the whole time. That's who he
[50:54] is. But now he's going to this garden.
[50:56] Now he's going to this place. Amen.
[50:58] Right. And God is going to separate his
[51:01] spirit from the man because he has to
[51:03] die as a man.
[51:07] Amen. Because that's that's our
[51:09] condition.
[51:10] Amen. That's our condition. We were born
[51:13] separated from God. We know the joy
[51:15] today. We rejoiced when we came in and
[51:18] we praised God because we know what it's
[51:20] like to be separate from God. We were
[51:22] born in that condition. That's why you
[51:24] had to be born again. That's why you had
[51:26] to be redeemed. because you know what
[51:27] it's like to live a life without hope.
[51:30] You know what it's like to live a life
[51:32] without Christ in your life. That's
[51:33] where you were. Amen. But that's not
[51:35] where you're at today.
[51:37] But he's never known that. He's never
[51:40] been in that condition. And now he's
[51:42] going to choose
[51:44] to go into it for you and I.
[51:49] Oh my. My wife played it on the way
[51:51] here. We're listening to brother this
[51:52] morning. You think about Jesus didn't
[51:54] have a place to even be born in. didn't
[51:56] have a place to die. Heaven couldn't
[51:57] take him. Earth didn't want him, so he
[51:59] hung in between. Nobody wants him.
[52:03] This thing that we all celebrate today,
[52:05] nobody wanted him three days ago. The
[52:08] Jews didn't want him. The city didn't
[52:10] want him. His people didn't want him.
[52:11] His own disciples. That's right. That
[52:14] had worked miracles and seen him do
[52:17] things, seen him raise the dead. They
[52:20] themselves. And there's Peter. I won't
[52:21] forsake you. Even if everyone else says,
[52:23] "Oh, when that before the crows
[52:25] twice, you'll forsake me. You'll deny
[52:27] me." Amen. His own disciples.
[52:31] Everybody leaves him. Right. Now, we all
[52:35] have dealt with rejection.
[52:38] We've all dealt with disappointments,
[52:40] but probably nobody quite like this.
[52:44] None of us can go to Jesus and say,
[52:45] "Well, listen, you don't know what it's
[52:46] like. People didn't like me."
[52:48] Huh? People still don't like him. And he
[52:52] proved the resurrection.
[52:54] Listen, this is almighty God in human
[52:56] form. The the most holy one, the most
[52:59] perfect one, never sinned, never did
[53:02] nothing wrong, and they hated him for
[53:03] it. Right. He's despised. He's rejected
[53:07] of men. Amen. Brother Ram says this. He
[53:10] says, "The love that he had, how he
[53:12] expressed it, how he had to make himself
[53:14] what he was to die to save us." Notice
[53:17] this. In his death, when he died at
[53:18] Calvary, there was never a death could
[53:20] be like that death.
[53:22] We are told when the Roman soldier
[53:24] pierced his side, there was water and
[53:25] blood came out of his side. He said,
[53:26] I've asked a chemist one time what taken
[53:28] place. And this fellow being a
[53:29] Christian, he said Jesus did not die
[53:31] because the spirit touched his side or
[53:34] pierced his side. Said Jesus had been
[53:35] dead a long time before that, but he
[53:37] died from grief. Right.
[53:42] The sword never killed him, neither the
[53:44] driving of the nails, but it was grief
[53:46] that killed him when he looked out upon
[53:48] the ones he had loved and the ones that
[53:51] he had worked miracles on and the ones
[53:53] that he had expressed his love toward
[53:55] and had fed and see that they had turned
[53:57] him down. You and I might be grieved.
[54:00] Now, I don't know what you're going
[54:00] through this morning. Amen. And I'm not
[54:02] trying to make light of that. But we
[54:04] endure grief. We go through grief. We
[54:06] might grieve. He says, "But we could
[54:08] never grieve like that because we're not
[54:10] made up of that kind of material that we
[54:12] can have that much grief." Now, I want
[54:14] you to consider this. Amen. Here he is.
[54:16] He's rejected his whole life. It's just
[54:19] a series of rejection and heartache.
[54:22] Amen. At one point, he's got 70
[54:23] disciples. They leave him. He's got 12
[54:25] disciples. They leave him. Everybody
[54:27] leave. Listen, he comes into Jerusalem
[54:29] and he's the big- time preacher at the
[54:30] beginning of the week. Amen. Oh, hosana.
[54:33] Glory to God in the highest. here.
[54:35] Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[54:37] the Lord. Man, they're they're all
[54:39] they're amped up, man. I tell you what,
[54:40] they're getting ready to have a good
[54:42] time. And them same people by the end of
[54:43] the week, you know what I'm talking
[54:44] about. Them same people that loved him,
[54:46] them same people that were excited about
[54:47] him, by the end of the week, they're the
[54:49] ones going to crucify him.
[54:52] Well, praise the Lord. I know I'm
[54:53] preaching to somebody. Amen. You've been
[54:54] there. The same ones you love, the some
[54:57] same ones you labored for, the same ones
[54:59] you give yourself for, son, that's the
[55:00] ones that hurts the most. It's not the
[55:03] guy at the gas station that doesn't like
[55:05] you or the color of your car and he
[55:07] makes fun of you for being a holy.
[55:08] That's not the one. But it's your own
[55:10] close friend. It's that one that you
[55:12] loved. It's that one you laid down your
[55:14] life for and they rejected you. Amen.
[55:19] And here they are. They're the ones
[55:22] crying crucify him.
[55:24] But so much deeper than the constant
[55:26] rejection, heartache, his composition,
[55:28] his makeup, it enables him to feel a
[55:31] level of grief that you and I just
[55:32] aren't able to comprehend because we've
[55:34] never pre-nown the father and then known
[55:36] separation. Amen. Brother Bam says this
[55:38] in that great crucial hour until he
[55:40] suffered knowing all things until the
[55:43] water and blood separated in his body
[55:45] and great drops of sweat like blood
[55:47] dropped from his brow. Notice he died
[55:49] more death in Gethsemane
[55:51] than he did on the cross. Now, I I know
[55:53] that really struck me. I was just
[55:54] studying this the other day, and I've
[55:55] I've thought about this before, but you
[55:56] think about this. Where did Jesus really
[55:58] die? He dies when he makes a decision,
[56:02] not my will, but thine be done. The rest
[56:05] is just playing it out. Amen. Listen,
[56:07] Adam and and the woman were told in the
[56:09] beginning, on the day you take this this
[56:11] fruit of this tree and you eat thereof,
[56:13] that's the day you're going to die.
[56:14] Well, they didn't drop dead immediately.
[56:16] But yet, they were dead. They were
[56:18] separated in a day with the Lord says a
[56:20] thousand years. That's why Adam doesn't
[56:21] live to be more than a thousand years
[56:22] old. Amen. But as soon as they make
[56:25] their decision, they're already
[56:27] separated. Cuz that's what death is.
[56:29] It's separation. The body without the
[56:31] spirit is dead. They're separated from
[56:34] God. They're separated from fellowship.
[56:36] So here, clear back in the beginning,
[56:38] we've got a man and he makes a decision
[56:40] when he realizes that his wife has
[56:42] transgressed the one commandment. Amen.
[56:46] That God gave him. Amen. He realizes
[56:48] this that and him not willing to live
[56:50] without her. Oh my
[56:53] praise the Lord. I I can't live without
[56:55] her. Uh she she's my bone of my bone,
[56:59] flesh of my she's not just why I'll get
[57:01] another one. No, that's my sweetheart.
[57:04] That's my queen. That's mine. I can't
[57:06] live without her. I'd rather die.
[57:09] Oh my. I'd rather die than live without
[57:12] her. Amen. So him knowing not being
[57:15] deceived there in that garden, he makes
[57:17] a decision to die. Amen. But his
[57:21] decisions in disobedience. But this one,
[57:24] Christ makes this decision in a garden
[57:26] of obedience. Amen. Because he's not
[57:28] willing to live without you and I. Amen.
[57:32] Here's the first Adam and he disobys
[57:34] because he's not willing to live without
[57:36] her. Amen. And because of his one
[57:38] decision, death come upon all. But this
[57:40] last Adam, this one that can't sin, this
[57:43] sinless one, he's got a choice to make.
[57:46] And he's got a capacity to do it that
[57:48] you and I don't have. Amen. We don't
[57:50] have enough righteousness for ourself.
[57:53] Let alone for another. But by one man's
[57:57] sacrifice, by one man's obedience, oh
[58:00] my. Because of one decision, you and I
[58:04] can stand here today, not just forgiven,
[58:07] not just good enough. We're the
[58:08] righteousness of God, justified in his
[58:11] sight.
[58:13] Now listen, this man, he's got a right
[58:16] like Adam did. Adam could have chose.
[58:18] You know what? What? Life was a lot
[58:20] quieter without a wife. Things were a
[58:23] lot easier and I have to put up with it.
[58:24] Amen. Praise the glory to God. Now you
[58:27] men are laughing, but you act like
[58:28] you're all just a bunch of saints. You
[58:30] was hard to put up with, too. You know,
[58:33] you get married and you're just as happy
[58:35] as can be. things are going to get
[58:37] better from here on out. You didn't
[58:38] realize you're going to have twice as
[58:40] many struggles. You're going to have
[58:42] twice as many trials. You're going to
[58:43] have to live with a person that that
[58:45] that that angel that you saw and they're
[58:48] just as perfect as can be and she's the
[58:50] best thing ever and he's so pretty and
[58:51] he's so that that's there's a
[58:53] transformation that takes place. Amen.
[58:56] You're living together and all a sudden
[58:58] there's a transformation. You know what?
[59:00] I don't remember that part about him
[59:02] when we were courting. I don't remember
[59:03] that coming out before. Amen. You begin
[59:06] to see things, right? Well, I don't know
[59:08] why I'm going here. I guess it's for I
[59:11] don't know who it's for. Amen.
[59:16] There's something in your life. There's
[59:18] things you didn't plan for. There's an
[59:20] ugly side to them and there's an ugly
[59:22] side to you. Amen. But you know what?
[59:25] The that it's it's worth it when you
[59:28] realize that the love that you have for
[59:30] that person. Brother Bam said, "If you
[59:31] can't live without them, Amen. Well, I
[59:33] don't know if I should if I should
[59:34] marry." Well, can you live without it?
[59:35] Well, no. Well, that's how you know.
[59:38] Amen. In other words, you know there's
[59:40] hardships and maybe you didn't plan for
[59:42] all of them, but despite that, it's
[59:44] worth it.
[59:46] If it wasn't work, it wouldn't be worth
[59:48] it. Amen. It's Listen, this is something
[59:50] our society as a as a whole has lost the
[59:52] idea of if a marriage is valuable, it's
[59:55] worth working on. You don't give up on
[59:57] it. Amen. It's not like a microwave or a
[1:00:00] toaster oven. It breaks, you get a new
[1:00:02] one. No, you fix it. You make a
[1:00:04] commitment. Two people are committed to
[1:00:06] making it work. Well, glory to God. Here
[1:00:09] I am for whatever reason. Like I said, I
[1:00:10] don't know why, but listen, Jesus has a
[1:00:12] right. Adam had a right. Well, listen. I
[1:00:15] can just uh you know, maybe we'll just
[1:00:16] get another one. Find another one. No, I
[1:00:18] want that one cuz she's part of me. And
[1:00:21] listen, Jesus, brother said, Jesus had a
[1:00:23] right to live a normal life. He could go
[1:00:25] and get married. He could live a normal
[1:00:26] life. He has a choice to do that. Amen.
[1:00:29] But he looks at all these things that I
[1:00:31] just talked about, and he's not ignorant
[1:00:33] of it. He knows every sin you're ever
[1:00:34] going to commit. He knows every problem
[1:00:36] you're ever going to go through. He
[1:00:37] knows every time you're going to
[1:00:38] grumble. Every time you're going to
[1:00:39] complain, every time you're going to
[1:00:41] make it hard, every time you're going to
[1:00:42] backslide. He sees it all. He sees the
[1:00:45] cross. He sees the suffering. And he
[1:00:48] endures the shame. He sees it because
[1:00:50] the joy that was set before him.
[1:00:54] He said, "It's going to hurt like it's
[1:00:56] never hurt before. And you're going to
[1:00:58] go through things and I'm going to go
[1:00:59] through things, but it's worth it to him
[1:01:01] at the end.
[1:01:04] Think about that now. You are worth it
[1:01:06] to him to go through all that. Amen. You
[1:01:08] might not feel that way about yourself
[1:01:10] this morning. You might not feel that
[1:01:11] way about your neighbor. I don't know
[1:01:12] what you're going through. Amen. But
[1:01:13] whatever you're thinking about it, it
[1:01:15] was worth it to Jesus Christ.
[1:01:20] So by his
[1:01:21] obedience, he forfeits his right to what
[1:01:24] he wants. That's right. That's so good.
[1:01:28] He surrenders not to disobedience is the
[1:01:29] first Adam, but he surreners to
[1:01:31] obedience. Not my will, but thy will be
[1:01:33] done. Romans 5 says, "By one man's
[1:01:35] obedience, many were made sinners. So by
[1:01:38] the obedience of one shall many be made
[1:01:42] righteous." Amen. So I want to revisit
[1:01:44] this. Like I said, it's there in
[1:01:46] Gethsemane. Brother Bram says that's
[1:01:47] where he dies his death. Amen. The rest
[1:01:50] is just playing out what's already taken
[1:01:52] place there. When he gives up, Amen.
[1:01:55] Listen, he can get out of there. He can
[1:01:57] call for 10,000 angels.
[1:02:00] It's not a lack of choice. Amen. He
[1:02:04] chooses not to do it for your sakes.
[1:02:07] Amen. He knows this is the very reason
[1:02:09] he's there. And so there, brother Bram
[1:02:11] talks about it. I believe it's in
[1:02:12] marriage and divorce. There the spirit
[1:02:14] leaves him in Gethsemane because he has
[1:02:16] to die as a he can't go up there and die
[1:02:18] as almighty God with all power because
[1:02:20] you can't identify with that. None of us
[1:02:23] dies in that condition. Amen. So he's
[1:02:25] got to die in this separated condition
[1:02:28] to be identified with your death. Amen.
[1:02:31] So it's now with Adam, our sins separate
[1:02:35] us from God. Amen. Each one of us if we
[1:02:37] don't repent, if we don't receive Jesus
[1:02:39] Christ, we die in our sins and our sins
[1:02:42] have separated us. It's it made a chasm
[1:02:44] between us and God. Amen. There's
[1:02:46] something between us. It's our sins.
[1:02:50] Amen. And I want you to think about
[1:02:51] this. When Adam sins and he loses
[1:02:54] fellowship with God, what does God do?
[1:02:56] He comes looking for Adam.
[1:02:59] He's looking for him. Listen, none of us
[1:03:01] sought God. Not one of us is righteous.
[1:03:03] Not one. We didn't seek God. He sought
[1:03:06] you. What he did there with Adam is all
[1:03:08] he's ever done. He come looking for me.
[1:03:11] He come looking for you. He come looking
[1:03:13] for
[1:03:16] Adam. But notice when Jesus makes his
[1:03:19] decision, God doesn't come looking. God
[1:03:21] leaves him.
[1:03:26] The one that was righteous is the one
[1:03:28] that's forsaken.
[1:03:30] Our sins separated us from God, but our
[1:03:33] sins separated him from God.
[1:03:36] So, he's not a sinner in the sense that
[1:03:38] he's committed his own sins. He's a
[1:03:40] sinner as far as his identification with
[1:03:42] us because he dies in a separated
[1:03:44] condition. Amen. He dies and the spirit
[1:03:47] has departed him. And listen, God come
[1:03:49] looking for Adam. God come. No one's
[1:03:51] coming for Jesus. The only ones coming
[1:03:53] for him are coming to take him away to
[1:03:55] prison. They're coming to take him away
[1:03:57] to judgment. No one's coming to save
[1:03:58] him. No one's coming to rescue him. No
[1:04:01] one's coming to give him a way out.
[1:04:02] Amen.
[1:04:04] Oh my Lord. He's not a sinner, but he's
[1:04:07] going to be judged as a sinner because
[1:04:10] of our because the sacrifice has to be
[1:04:12] identified with your condition. So he's
[1:04:14] on the
[1:04:15] cross and he says, "Why hast thou
[1:04:17] forsaken me? because it pleased the
[1:04:19] father to bruise him.
[1:04:22] That's a strange thing to us, but it
[1:04:24] pleased the father to bruise him because
[1:04:26] of his sacrifice. It makes many
[1:04:29] righteous under salvation. Amen. So
[1:04:32] there's many times and I say this to
[1:04:34] come to this point. There's many times
[1:04:36] in our life we feel forsaken like I did
[1:04:37] that morning. Maybe even today you were
[1:04:40] sitting here in church and maybe you
[1:04:41] praise the Lord with everybody else. You
[1:04:42] had a good time. But somewhere in your
[1:04:44] heart you're you're dreading going home
[1:04:45] today. you're dreading going somewhere
[1:04:48] next, you know, when you go back to work
[1:04:49] or whatever it is. Somewhere in our
[1:04:50] lives, many times we deal with this
[1:04:52] idea. We feel forsaken. We feel
[1:04:54] abandoned. Has anybody ever been there?
[1:04:56] Listen, you're doing everything you're
[1:04:58] supposed to do. You're praying. You're
[1:04:59] seeking God. You're reading the
[1:05:00] scripture. You haven't done anything
[1:05:02] that you can tell that you did wrong.
[1:05:04] You're going through your life. And yet
[1:05:06] somewhere you feel abandoned. Amen. But
[1:05:08] I want you to realize that he'll never
[1:05:10] leave you. He'll never forsake you.
[1:05:13] That's why Jesus was forsaken. So you'd
[1:05:16] never have to be. Amen. Sometimes we
[1:05:18] pray and the heavens seem like brass.
[1:05:20] Sometimes we feel like orphan children,
[1:05:22] but he'll never leave you. He'll never
[1:05:25] forsake you. Amen. No one's ever been
[1:05:27] forsaken like he was in his darkest
[1:05:29] hour. And he knows this. But you know
[1:05:32] what? There's a confidence in him. Even
[1:05:34] in the darkest hour of life, there's a
[1:05:36] confidence in him. Amen. Because there's
[1:05:38] a commandment over his life. He said,
[1:05:40] "I've received a commandment from the
[1:05:41] father. I get to lay down my life, but I
[1:05:44] can take it up again. This receipt have
[1:05:46] I I this commandment have I received of
[1:05:48] the father. Amen. Now, listen. I'm going
[1:05:50] to be honest with you. I don't have that
[1:05:52] commandment over my life, and neither do
[1:05:54] you. He's going to have to raise it up
[1:05:56] at the last days. Amen. But this one's
[1:05:58] got to command me. I laid down my life.
[1:06:01] No man takes it from me.
[1:06:05] It might look like the Romans took it.
[1:06:07] It might look like the Jews took it, but
[1:06:09] no one can take it. He gives it up.
[1:06:12] That's why he can stand and tell Pilate,
[1:06:14] "Listen, you've got no power over me
[1:06:16] than what my father gives you. You might
[1:06:19] think you've got power, but you don't
[1:06:21] have power. I've got power. I am power.
[1:06:24] I'm the almighty God veiled in human
[1:06:27] flesh."
[1:06:29] And there's a commandment. He knows
[1:06:30] pilot can't take my life anymore than
[1:06:32] anybody else. Only one person can lay
[1:06:34] down this life, and it's me. And he goes
[1:06:37] into the grave with his confidence. He
[1:06:39] gives up the ghost. He yields up his
[1:06:42] spirit cuz he realized there's a word
[1:06:43] over his life. Amen. Listen, he might
[1:06:46] seem forsaken, but he's not utterly
[1:06:49] forsaken because God had spoken a word
[1:06:51] through David hundreds of years prior.
[1:06:54] He said, "I will not leave his soul in
[1:06:56] hell."
[1:06:59] He might go down, but he's not going to
[1:07:00] stay there. I'm not going to leave him
[1:07:02] there. I will not leave his soul in
[1:07:05] hell. I will not suffer my holy one to
[1:07:08] see
[1:07:10] corruption. No matter how bad it looks,
[1:07:12] I'm not going to leave him in that
[1:07:14] condition. Listen, if he forsook him, it
[1:07:17] would not leave him in that condition.
[1:07:19] He's not going to leave you where you're
[1:07:20] at. He said, "I'm going through the
[1:07:22] trial of my life, but he won't leave you
[1:07:24] there. He's not going to leave you in
[1:07:27] that condition." Oh my.
[1:07:30] Yay. Though I walk through the valley of
[1:07:32] the shadow of death, thou art with me.
[1:07:36] He won't leave you. He won't forsake
[1:07:39] you. What is Easter to you and I? Don't
[1:07:42] ever fear to go anywhere or do anything.
[1:07:45] Cuz the unfailing presence of the Lord
[1:07:47] Jesus Christ is always with you. As I
[1:07:50] was with Moses, so shall I be with thee.
[1:07:53] He's with you.
[1:07:55] He's not in the grave today. He's with
[1:07:57] you. Oh my.
[1:08:01] I love this. Amen. Cuz I can identify
[1:08:04] with that. We all can if we're honest.
[1:08:05] Amen. Some women get up the next
[1:08:07] morning, they go to Sunday service.
[1:08:08] Amen. The first Sunday sunrise service
[1:08:11] there ever was. And they weren't
[1:08:13] dressing up to the nines and get ready
[1:08:14] to sing some good songs and get a song
[1:08:16] special and have a good time. They were
[1:08:18] discouraged. They were depressed. They
[1:08:20] were down and out. That's good. Amen.
[1:08:23] They weren't coming to church. Bless
[1:08:24] God, he's up
[1:08:26] again. Praise God for the resurrection.
[1:08:28] They were just as they were as a
[1:08:29] defeated as a people could be. Yeah,
[1:08:31] that is true. That is true. Peter's
[1:08:34] ready to go back to fishing. They're
[1:08:36] ready to go back to what they used to it
[1:08:37] was all for nothing. Amen. They were all
[1:08:39] done played out. They done give up.
[1:08:42] Amen. And these women, they come for the
[1:08:44] first sunrise service and they get to
[1:08:46] that too. Listen, they're not expecting
[1:08:48] the stone to be rolled away. We know
[1:08:50] it's rolled away. They're looking to
[1:08:52] have to move it and do this and do a
[1:08:54] bunch of work. And when they get there,
[1:08:56] there's an angel that's unsealed the
[1:08:59] tomb. And he reveals, listen, this tomb
[1:09:02] that was sealed, this seal's been
[1:09:03] broken. And it testified a resurrection
[1:09:06] had taken place. He is not
[1:09:09] here. Now, if he wasn't there, then it
[1:09:11] means he came back.
[1:09:14] I'm getting there. I'll get there in a
[1:09:15] second. Amen. He's not here. He's risen.
[1:09:18] But go tell the brethren. Go tell his
[1:09:20] disciples. So, they run back and Peter
[1:09:22] and John, they run to the tomb. They're
[1:09:23] looking.
[1:09:26] Amen.
[1:09:27] Oh my. They're looking around. They
[1:09:30] don't see it. These women are like,
[1:09:32] "Listen, he's not here." Listen, they
[1:09:34] they get done with church. They didn't
[1:09:36] know they were going to have a revival
[1:09:37] service. They got done with Easter
[1:09:38] Sunday. They were having revival
[1:09:40] services. Listen, he's not dead. They
[1:09:42] told the angel told us he's risen. He's
[1:09:46] alive. He's not in that dead
[1:09:48] denomination. He's not in that creed.
[1:09:50] He's not in that dogma. He's alive
[1:09:52] forever more. They went home with
[1:09:55] revival and they begin to tell everybody
[1:09:56] he's risen. You won't believe what
[1:09:58] happened. And guess what? They didn't.
[1:10:03] Hallelujah. Like, well, where'd he go?
[1:10:06] We wonder where we at. Well, he the
[1:10:07] angel done told you he's risen. Was so
[1:10:09] hard to figure out.
[1:10:13] Well, we just don't know where he's at.
[1:10:16] Well, where' they take his body?
[1:10:19] They didn't take it. He's a real Look.
[1:10:22] Let me spell this out for you. R I S E
[1:10:24] N. He's alive. He told you he would do
[1:10:27] it. Yeah, but where's he at? He's where
[1:10:29] he told you he's going to be at.
[1:10:33] Yeah, you all laugh cuz you've done the
[1:10:34] same thing before.
[1:10:36] I see. Oh, I'm the same way. I look in
[1:10:39] the mirror. Oh man, where's God at? He's
[1:10:40] right where he told you he's at.
[1:10:43] He's right in his word. He's right in
[1:10:46] his spirit. Listen, he's he's not
[1:10:48] somewhere other than what he told you.
[1:10:50] You just don't see it
[1:10:54] in your discouragement, in your trouble,
[1:10:57] in your self-pity. You don't see what's
[1:10:59] obvious.
[1:11:01] We we we Oh my, we get so caught up in
[1:11:05] the problem, we don't see the solutions
[1:11:06] right there.
[1:11:09] What I really like about this, you know,
[1:11:10] this this I don't know where you're all
[1:11:12] at, but this just really struck me. Just
[1:11:14] a couple days ago, I was studying
[1:11:16] this that they all they all get there.
[1:11:20] The disciples show up. They all look
[1:11:21] around. They can't find him. They hear
[1:11:23] from the angel and they all leave except
[1:11:27] one. It just really struck me. Mary, she
[1:11:29] remains behind. She lingers just a
[1:11:31] little bit. Amen. Our friends, that's
[1:11:33] where we miss him so many times. A lot
[1:11:35] of times we miss him because we don't
[1:11:37] just wait a little bit.
[1:11:39] Sometimes we miss him because we're just
[1:11:41] in a big hurry to move on. Amen.
[1:11:45] Sometimes he's right there and if we're
[1:11:46] not careful, we miss it because we're so
[1:11:48] caught up in everything else. Amen. And
[1:11:51] listen, she's there and she lingers.
[1:11:53] Amen. She's not in a big hurry, but
[1:11:55] she's actually crying. Amen. And she
[1:11:57] looks back in that empty tomb. Right.
[1:12:00] When everybody else is moving on, you
[1:12:02] say, "I can't move on yet.
[1:12:05] Why am I still the one? Everybody else
[1:12:07] seems to just kind of move on and I'm
[1:12:10] just sitting here waiting. Maybe God's
[1:12:11] got you waiting for a reason." That's
[1:12:13] right.
[1:12:15] Why does it seem like I'm the only one
[1:12:17] here that feels this way? Or well, maybe
[1:12:19] God's got you there for a reason. He had
[1:12:21] her there for a reason. She's at this
[1:12:23] tomb. She looks inside and she's weeping
[1:12:27] and she sees these two angels. I love
[1:12:29] it. It's a a type of the mercy seat.
[1:12:30] One's at the head and one's at the foot.
[1:12:33] And they ask her the question, "What?
[1:12:35] Why weepest thou? Why are you crying
[1:12:38] for?" Right? And she says, "They've
[1:12:40] taken away my Lord and I don't know
[1:12:42] where he's at." You ever been there? I
[1:12:45] don't know where he's at. I look for him
[1:12:47] and I look for him. I feel forsaken. I
[1:12:49] don't know where he's at. You know where
[1:12:49] he's at? He's where he promised. He's
[1:12:51] between the wings of the cherubam. He
[1:12:53] said, "I'll meet you." Listen, he told
[1:12:55] you if you want to find me, I'll tell
[1:12:57] you where to look. Amen. He told him in
[1:12:59] the Old Testament, "If you go and meet
[1:13:00] me there, I'll meet you in that place
[1:13:02] between the wings of the chair. Just go
[1:13:04] where he told you to meet him." Amen.
[1:13:05] He's got a provided place and we'll look
[1:13:09] for him everywhere else and we'll walk
[1:13:11] away. But there's a provided place in
[1:13:13] his word for us. Amen. If we'll just
[1:13:15] look there, we might not realize it, but
[1:13:17] he's there. Listen, he's right where he
[1:13:20] promised. Well, why you weeping? I don't
[1:13:21] even know where he's at. Have you taken
[1:13:23] him? And she turns around and she sees
[1:13:25] somebody, but she doesn't recognize him.
[1:13:28] Amen. Amen. Now, I'm not going to teach
[1:13:30] you all Greek today, but I looked this
[1:13:32] word up because she looks at this guy
[1:13:34] and she supposes he's the gardener. So,
[1:13:36] here we are again in the garden.
[1:13:39] We're back in the garden again. And she
[1:13:41] sees this guy and the the King James
[1:13:43] says he's the she supposes that he's the
[1:13:45] gardener, but it's actually a little bit
[1:13:47] stronger, the Greek word, he's the
[1:13:49] keeper of a garden. In other words, he's
[1:13:50] in charge of it. Like the man at the
[1:13:53] beginning, he's the one that's placed in
[1:13:54] authority. She assumes that this man has
[1:13:57] authority in this garden. So she says,
[1:13:59] "Listen, I'm I'm looking for him where
[1:14:01] they took his body. Will you tell me
[1:14:03] where he's at?" And she and then he
[1:14:06] says, "Mary." And she recognizes it's
[1:14:08] him. He was there the whole time. Now,
[1:14:13] now listen, here's a For a moment, he
[1:14:15] wasn't in that room because the angel
[1:14:16] said he was gone. So he actually comes
[1:14:18] back.
[1:14:20] Now listen, she's not even allowed to
[1:14:21] touch him. And I'll get to this in a few
[1:14:23] minutes, but he's doing a priestly duty.
[1:14:25] Amen. He's got to go ascend into the
[1:14:27] holy place and enter into the holy place
[1:14:29] first. So, he's got a job to do. Amen.
[1:14:32] All redemption is hanging on this job.
[1:14:35] This this job of him going up and
[1:14:38] ascending and presenting himself in the
[1:14:40] holy place, the perfect sacrifice, the
[1:14:42] perfect blood, the resurrected savior.
[1:14:44] So, I'll hitch on this, but before he
[1:14:46] does, before he does, I'm going to I'm
[1:14:48] going to go back to the garden real
[1:14:49] quick cuz I've got a daughter there. I'm
[1:14:52] going to go back for one person just to
[1:14:54] let her know, just a
[1:14:57] reminder, just to encourage her a little
[1:14:59] bit. Listen, it's it's going to be okay.
[1:15:03] I'm going to take some time to stop by.
[1:15:06] Listen, I believe he's stopping by
[1:15:07] today. Amen. I believe you brought him
[1:15:09] with you, but I believe the word is here
[1:15:11] today. And he wants to remind you if
[1:15:13] he's not coming for anybody else,
[1:15:14] sometimes he'll come for one person.
[1:15:18] Sometimes God will orchestrate an entire
[1:15:20] thing for one person.
[1:15:24] Amen. Just ask Elijah. Just ask Isaiah.
[1:15:27] God will go set up a whole meeting, do a
[1:15:29] whole big thing to talk to one person
[1:15:32] sometimes.
[1:15:33] Don't tell me you're not important to
[1:15:35] God. Amen. God will topple entire
[1:15:38] nations for one prodal son. Amen. Oh my.
[1:15:43] Well, I've got to go ascend, but I felt
[1:15:45] it necessary.
[1:15:48] to stop and let you know first.
[1:15:54] Oh my. She didn't recognize him, but he
[1:15:57] identifies her. And when he does, she
[1:15:59] recognized this is him. Amen. I love
[1:16:02] this, and I'm going to tie this in here
[1:16:03] in a minute, but brother Bam talks about
[1:16:05] this. You know, later that day, you go
[1:16:06] to over to Luke 24, you read the story.
[1:16:08] Couple disciples, they're walking along
[1:16:10] the way later on the road to Emmas.
[1:16:12] Amen. And they're walking down there.
[1:16:13] It's the same day. and and they don't
[1:16:15] realize they're getting ready for a long
[1:16:17] service. It's going to be all I'm not
[1:16:19] going to try to keep you long today, but
[1:16:21] they're getting ready for an all
[1:16:22] afternoon service. Amen. They're walking
[1:16:24] there. They're questioning, "Well, he
[1:16:26] said he was going to die and raise
[1:16:27] again, and the tomb's empty. What could
[1:16:29] it mean?"
[1:16:31] Before you laugh him too much, we do the
[1:16:33] same thing. Well, I know the Bible said
[1:16:35] this, but okay, see, that was where your
[1:16:36] problem was. Just take him at his word.
[1:16:38] Amen. They're trying to figure out what
[1:16:40] what manner of things he's here comes
[1:16:42] Jesus. Ah, I I use this a lot. Amen. Cuz
[1:16:45] I I'll do it with my kids sometimes.
[1:16:46] Amen. Jesus walks up and asks him a
[1:16:48] question that he already knows the
[1:16:50] answer
[1:16:51] to. Oh, what manner of communications
[1:16:54] are these? Singer said, "Oh, well, don't
[1:16:56] you know anything?"
[1:17:00] Probably trying not to laugh. I know a
[1:17:03] lot more than
[1:17:04] you. I know what's going on. I know what
[1:17:07] you're going through more than you do is
[1:17:09] what he's thinking. That's right. Well,
[1:17:11] don't you know that this great man,
[1:17:14] Jesus, we supposed him to be a prophet,
[1:17:16] a great teacher, but he's died, and now
[1:17:18] his body's gone, and we don't know what
[1:17:20] to make of it. Oh, fools and slow of
[1:17:23] hearts to believe all that was spoken by
[1:17:25] the law and the prophets. Ought not
[1:17:27] Christ to have suffered all these things
[1:17:29] to enter into his glory?
[1:17:33] And he begins at Moses and he goes to
[1:17:35] the prophets and what does he do? He
[1:17:37] preaches Christ out of every scripture.
[1:17:38] So I believe that's why the prophet
[1:17:39] could say, "Listen, if you can't see
[1:17:41] Jesus in every scripture, go back and
[1:17:43] read it again." I like to dramatize
[1:17:45] this. Is that all right? Listen, he
[1:17:47] maybe he starts over here with Abraham,
[1:17:48] the great patriarch, and he goes through
[1:17:50] that and he preaches that sermon. Amen.
[1:17:52] And he and he takes God's covenant with
[1:17:54] Abraham, the patriarch Abraham. He
[1:17:56] begins to preach Moses, a prophet like
[1:17:58] unto Moses, why Christ speak. He begins
[1:18:00] to preach about all these things. He's
[1:18:02] preaching about this and and going
[1:18:03] through a secondhanded robe, going
[1:18:05] through Elijah, going through like we
[1:18:06] had in this day. Amen. Like we had in
[1:18:09] this day, he's going through all these
[1:18:11] things, preaching all these types of the
[1:18:12] Bible, and showing you the thing you
[1:18:14] didn't realize. It's talking about Jesus
[1:18:16] Christ. The whole thing is a revelation
[1:18:18] of Jesus Christ because who he is is who
[1:18:21] you are.
[1:18:24] And all day long, they're going through
[1:18:26] the influence of another perfect faith,
[1:18:28] the things that are to be. They're going
[1:18:30] through all this and they're they begin
[1:18:32] to get excited. Amen. Their hearts begin
[1:18:34] to burn. They're having a good time in
[1:18:36] church. and they're and they're they're
[1:18:37] they're being blessed, but yet they
[1:18:41] don't even recognize who's talking to
[1:18:43] them.
[1:18:46] There you go. Man, we had a good time in
[1:18:49] church. They didn't. Oh, yeah. It was a
[1:18:50] real blessing. Who was it that did that?
[1:18:52] Well, you know what was the Lord? Do you
[1:18:54] realize what that means?
[1:18:57] Do you realize what that means? Amen.
[1:18:59] Listen, they they they understood what
[1:19:01] he was saying. They acknowledged it, but
[1:19:03] they didn't recognize who was speaking
[1:19:05] to them. But in the evening time,
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:10] listen. Listen. The son of man, he comes
[1:19:12] back as son of man at the end of the
[1:19:13] age. That's where we're at now. Amen.
[1:19:15] But he's been son of God the whole time.
[1:19:18] Amen. We can look at a man like Martin
[1:19:19] Luther and look at the mistakes and the
[1:19:22] failures in his life. And yet we
[1:19:23] recognize as message leaders, but that
[1:19:25] was God in that man. That was God in
[1:19:26] that reformation. That was God in
[1:19:28] Wesley. That was God in these men. Even
[1:19:30] with their faults and their failures and
[1:19:31] their mistakes, we recognize but God
[1:19:33] never left. It was God doing it the
[1:19:35] whole time.
[1:19:37] It might not look like, but it was God
[1:19:38] and Abraham, God and Moses, God and
[1:19:40] these reformers.
[1:19:42] Amen. But now we come to the evening
[1:19:44] time. Now we come to the climax. And it
[1:19:48] looks like he's going to let Leodysia go
[1:19:50] into tribulation. It looks like he's
[1:19:52] going to let things fall off. It's the
[1:19:53] end of the Gentile age. Amen. It looks
[1:19:54] like the end of all things, but there's
[1:19:56] a little room there. There's a little
[1:19:58] place. And these two disciples, they
[1:20:00] they hearts were on fire from the
[1:20:01] message and said, "You know what? and
[1:20:03] would you stay with us for a little
[1:20:04] while? Looked like he was going to drop
[1:20:06] it off. Oh, it's all going to go into
[1:20:07] tribulation. Amen. They ask brother Ram,
[1:20:10] does the church go into tribulation?
[1:20:11] Well, the church does, but not the
[1:20:13] bride.
[1:20:15] See, there's a people they they break
[1:20:16] off. They're not going into tribulation.
[1:20:18] They're going into glory. There's a
[1:20:20] separation. There's a distinction. Amen.
[1:20:23] There's a people that want to come in
[1:20:25] and s with him when the churches have
[1:20:27] put them out and the denominations have
[1:20:29] put them out. There's a people that want
[1:20:31] fellowship with almighty God.
[1:20:34] And they compel and want you to come in
[1:20:36] and stay with us in the evening time.
[1:20:41] And when they go in there, he begins to
[1:20:43] do a sign and he blesses the bread and
[1:20:45] he breaks the bread. When he breaks the
[1:20:47] bread, now their hearts aren't burning
[1:20:49] anymore. Now their eyes are
[1:20:52] open. See, a lot of people come to
[1:20:54] church and they'll get excited. They'll
[1:20:56] hear the message and they should and
[1:20:59] their hearts burn within them. Amen. And
[1:21:01] they'll hear brother preach for years
[1:21:02] and they'll hear about testimonies.
[1:21:04] They'll hear about miracles. They'll
[1:21:06] hear about a prophet. But it's not until
[1:21:08] your eyes are open you realize what it
[1:21:09] really is about. It's not about the man
[1:21:11] William Brandon. It's Jesus Christ
[1:21:14] revealed to you
[1:21:16] personally. God didn't send a prophet
[1:21:18] for a prophet. He sent a prophet for you
[1:21:21] to recognize that your eyes would be
[1:21:24] opened. It's Jesus Christ the same
[1:21:27] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:21:31] Listen, I appreciate enthusiasm. I'm
[1:21:34] going to get to that in a few minutes.
[1:21:35] Amen. I appreciate excitement. Amen. But
[1:21:37] I don't want to do that ignorantly. I
[1:21:39] want my eyes to be open to the reality
[1:21:42] of what God's doing.
[1:21:44] Cuz my enthusiasm can come and my
[1:21:46] enthusiasm can go. Amen. But no matter
[1:21:49] what you're going through, when you
[1:21:50] recognize who's speaking to you, it's
[1:21:52] not just some keeper of some garden.
[1:21:55] It's not just some man, William
[1:21:56] Brandham, some other healing revival
[1:21:58] teacher. God spoke to us through that
[1:22:00] man.
[1:22:02] And when your eyes are open to it, you
[1:22:04] don't doubt. You don't question. You
[1:22:06] don't worry. Well, is it right? Is it
[1:22:07] not right? Is this inspired? Is this
[1:22:09] not? You know who spoke to you. It's
[1:22:11] that sayeth the Lord.
[1:22:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Man, I tell you
[1:22:17] what, I feel pretty good. I was kind of
[1:22:18] worried about how this is going to
[1:22:20] go still a little bit.
[1:22:26] He's the one speaking to us. And
[1:22:28] hopefully you don't just feel that way
[1:22:30] about right now. Hopefully you do feel
[1:22:31] that way about it, but not only this.
[1:22:34] Hopefully you realize it's him speaking
[1:22:35] to you in your life. That he'll take you
[1:22:37] places sometimes like he took Mary, like
[1:22:39] he took the disciple. Why does he let
[1:22:41] him get in this condition to reveal
[1:22:43] himself?
[1:22:45] That's right. Amen. It's a whole another
[1:22:48] thought, but I was preaching this the
[1:22:49] other day. Sometimes God will let you
[1:22:50] get in the worst straight.
[1:22:53] The worst situations
[1:22:56] because he wants to show himself in that
[1:22:58] situation
[1:23:00] cuz he wants you to be able to sing that
[1:23:01] song, the God on the mountain is the God
[1:23:04] in the valley and know what you're
[1:23:05] talking about. It's not just words, but
[1:23:07] your eyes are open. I've heard it, but
[1:23:10] now I've seen.
[1:23:12] These disciples had heard, but Christ
[1:23:15] ascended. And now John can testify that
[1:23:17] which we have seen, which we've heard,
[1:23:19] which we've handled. It's the word of
[1:23:22] life. We beheld him. We They fastened
[1:23:25] upon his feet. They touched his side.
[1:23:27] He's no longer a God that's just out
[1:23:29] there, but they've handled
[1:23:32] the word of life. That's so good.
[1:23:36] Yes, sir.
[1:23:39] When you recognize it's Jesus Christ,
[1:23:40] it's no longer just learning. There's a
[1:23:42] lot of people that learn the message,
[1:23:44] but it's not in them. Amen. But when
[1:23:46] your eyes are opened, you realize it's
[1:23:48] God,
[1:23:51] just like it was for Mary, oh why why am
[1:23:56] I still here weeping? Because God's
[1:23:57] trying to speak to just you maybe about
[1:23:59] a thing. Amen. Brother talks about this
[1:24:02] uh in Luke chapter 24 and he preaches
[1:24:04] this sermon, the resurrection of Jesus.
[1:24:06] He says this. He says, "Now my prayer is
[1:24:08] that that same person will open to us
[1:24:10] the scriptures tonight." It's a very
[1:24:12] timely scripture because we're again in
[1:24:14] the resurrection in the Easter season.
[1:24:16] And I think that's one of the greatest
[1:24:18] scriptures. It's more neglected than any
[1:24:20] other scripture. That's good. That's his
[1:24:23] opinion. I I believe him. It's more
[1:24:26] neglected than any scripture know of
[1:24:29] being preached on is the ascension of
[1:24:31] the Lord Jesus. What I'm talking about
[1:24:32] today is ascension. Amen. That's right.
[1:24:35] He can't ascend unless he descended
[1:24:36] first. Amen. He had to go to a bad place
[1:24:39] to get to a good place. Amen.
[1:24:42] The ascension of the Lord Jesus, what he
[1:24:44] did after his resurrection. Now, he did
[1:24:46] not sit down in the tomb after his
[1:24:48] resurrection because his work wasn't
[1:24:50] completed. It wasn't finished. And the
[1:24:52] ones at the grave that morning were
[1:24:53] forbidden to even touch him. But that
[1:24:55] night, they were bidden to come feel his
[1:24:58] hands. He forbid his mother touch him.
[1:25:00] and it's actually Mary Magdalene but
[1:25:01] said I have not ascended into my father
[1:25:04] my God and yours and he had not yet he
[1:25:07] would only he was ready to do his great
[1:25:09] high priest work at that time he had
[1:25:11] just been anointed and when he was here
[1:25:13] on earth he lived a life he made himself
[1:25:17] a little lower than the angels in order
[1:25:18] to take away sin
[1:25:21] think about that he made himself that
[1:25:24] hallelujah amen we talk about that
[1:25:26] scripture Philippians chapter 2 let this
[1:25:28] mind be in you which is in God, Christ
[1:25:31] Jesus, who being in the form of God,
[1:25:32] thought I'm not robbery. We talk about
[1:25:34] that. Oh, we're He didn't think it was
[1:25:36] robbery to be equal with God. We're
[1:25:37] God's family. He's We think about that,
[1:25:40] but what's the next part tell us, but he
[1:25:42] made himself lower than the angels.
[1:25:45] Amen. He humbled himself to obedience,
[1:25:48] even death. So, the mindset is not just,
[1:25:50] hey, we've got resurrection power, but
[1:25:53] what are you going to do with it? Well,
[1:25:56] what did he do with it? Right? He could
[1:25:58] have called for angels. as he could have
[1:26:00] wiped the whole place out. Humbled
[1:26:01] himself.
[1:26:03] If anybody had a reason not to act
[1:26:05] humble, it was him. And he was the
[1:26:07] humblest one. So good. Amen. Everybody
[1:26:11] wants to, like Paul said, everybody
[1:26:12] wants to know him in the power of his
[1:26:14] resurrection. But nobody wants to know
[1:26:15] him in the fellowship of his sufferings.
[1:26:18] But you can't fully know him in the
[1:26:20] power of his resurrection until you know
[1:26:22] him in the fellowship of his suffering.
[1:26:25] You say, "Well, I don't want to know him
[1:26:26] in the fellow the fellowship of his
[1:26:28] suffering. That's too much." Well, he
[1:26:29] wanted to know you in your suffering.
[1:26:32] That's why he came down and bore it for
[1:26:33] you. Amen. That's why he's a high priest
[1:26:37] that can be touched with the feeling of
[1:26:39] our infirmities. Amen. It wasn't
[1:26:42] pleasant, but he was willing to embrace
[1:26:44] it so he could know that he could
[1:26:47] identify.
[1:26:49] He chose
[1:26:51] to suffer with you and I. Amen.
[1:26:54] Oh my.
[1:26:57] Just think who he was. This right here.
[1:26:58] Here he says, just think who he was. He
[1:27:00] was the logos that came from God in the
[1:27:02] beginning. He was the word of God. He
[1:27:04] was the angel of God that was with the
[1:27:05] children of Israel in the wilderness. He
[1:27:07] was the great supernatural of heaven,
[1:27:09] none other than Jehovah himself. And he
[1:27:11] came down on the earth and become a man.
[1:27:14] And not only a man, but he become the
[1:27:16] servant of man, and took upon himself
[1:27:19] and make a no reputation. He become a
[1:27:22] footwasher. Amen. And some of us won't
[1:27:26] go to church unless we get a position
[1:27:28] and we get our time and we get
[1:27:31] recognition and we get Oh, well, glory
[1:27:34] to God. We all want to be something in
[1:27:36] the church. We just don't want to be the
[1:27:36] footwasher.
[1:27:38] We don't want to be the door holder.
[1:27:39] Amen. Well, glory to God. I can really
[1:27:42] go on here. We all want to be We all
[1:27:45] want to serve God mostly as counselors
[1:27:47] or adviserss to God or some big
[1:27:50] something or other. But here's the
[1:27:51] greatest one. It's like, you know what?
[1:27:52] I'm going to wash the disciples feet.
[1:27:55] Right. Amen. There's your Easter for
[1:27:57] you. There you go. Oh my. It's not quite
[1:28:01] an egg or a bunny, but it's from God.
[1:28:03] Amen. I'll come and be the foot wash.
[1:28:10] Well, I won't do this thing unless I get
[1:28:12] to do this or be Wow.
[1:28:15] You imagine if Jesus did that, there'd
[1:28:17] be no human race to save. That's right.
[1:28:20] Listen, I I'll just be honest. If I
[1:28:22] wasn't a Christian, the old man, if you
[1:28:24] put me in Jesus spot, I'm out of here.
[1:28:28] I might as well make it work. Amen.
[1:28:30] Praise. Now, now don't act like it's
[1:28:32] just that was all of us. We were enemies
[1:28:35] of God in our thinking. Amen. We weren't
[1:28:37] trying to help any. We were after our
[1:28:39] own desires.
[1:28:44] Oh
[1:28:45] my. He become a foot wash. A footwasher.
[1:28:49] He went to the lowest city in the world,
[1:28:51] Jericho. Was so
[1:28:53] low till the smallest man of the city
[1:28:56] had to climb up in a tree to look down
[1:28:58] on him.
[1:29:00] Amen. All right. That's so good. And God
[1:29:04] raised him up
[1:29:06] and put him so high above every heaven
[1:29:09] till he has to stoop over to look to
[1:29:12] heaven. Hallelujah.
[1:29:15] He's not just there, he's over it. The
[1:29:17] Bible says he's above all heavens. Amen.
[1:29:19] He's got to do this just to look down
[1:29:22] into heaven. That's how high up he went.
[1:29:25] Oh my.
[1:29:28] That's what God did for him. So if you
[1:29:30] want to be exalted, humble yourself.
[1:29:35] And if you exalt yourself, you'll be
[1:29:37] brought down low. I think of him when
[1:29:39] he'd risen from the dead that morning
[1:29:40] and he had his own blood as the high
[1:29:42] priest. Think about that. He even
[1:29:43] brought his own blood. Amen.
[1:29:46] He went beyond the veils through every
[1:29:48] sphere. Satan in times past had men
[1:29:50] blocked off from heaven. He could not
[1:29:52] get in contact with
[1:29:54] heaven. But when Jesus took his blood,
[1:29:57] the first veil he rent was the veil of
[1:29:58] death and then the veil of the grave,
[1:30:00] the veil in the temple, then the veil of
[1:30:02] sickness, the veil of fear. Every veil
[1:30:04] that there was an unveiled God to man
[1:30:09] way and above the heavens of heavens and
[1:30:11] was seated on the right hand of God, set
[1:30:13] down as a finished work. That's right.
[1:30:15] above all. And there he opened a channel
[1:30:18] that God used to come down through the
[1:30:20] corridors of heaven and talk to mankind
[1:30:23] in the Garden of Eden. And Satan by sin
[1:30:26] had blocked them. But that great high
[1:30:27] priest with his anointed with his blood
[1:30:29] went through every veil and ripped her
[1:30:31] up and and cleared out the skies again
[1:30:33] that God and man could be father and son
[1:30:36] and commune again with one another. What
[1:30:38] a marvelous thing.
[1:30:41] Now, I don't have this in my notes, but
[1:30:42] I just want to say this. This is another
[1:30:44] thought I preached on here recently, but
[1:30:45] you look at the woman at the well. Amen.
[1:30:48] She's been taught one way and the Jews
[1:30:51] teach another way. And she the
[1:30:52] eventually, and like I said, I'm I'm
[1:30:54] just going to go into this real quick,
[1:30:55] but eventually the conversation comes
[1:30:57] into worship. Where should we worship
[1:31:00] God? Where should we go and worship God
[1:31:02] at? Should we worship here or worship
[1:31:04] there? And he says, "Listen, the time is
[1:31:06] coming and now is. If you want to
[1:31:08] worship God, do you worship him in
[1:31:10] spirit and in truth?
[1:31:13] And and I make this point I was making
[1:31:15] the other day somewhere. But you look at
[1:31:17] the Jews and the Samaritans. Why was
[1:31:19] there a contention about where to
[1:31:21] worship? Because they wanted to control
[1:31:25] how people worship. That's the Old
[1:31:27] Testament thought. Well, if you want to
[1:31:28] come to God, you've got to come through
[1:31:30] me. That's what the Catholic Church
[1:31:31] does. That's what denominations do.
[1:31:33] Well, if you want to come to God, you
[1:31:35] have to come through me. But listen,
[1:31:36] there's only one mediator.
[1:31:39] There's only one. It's not a pope or a
[1:31:41] potent. There's one mediator and Jesus
[1:31:43] says, "I'm him. I'm the
[1:31:45] one." See, uh, religion, let me say it
[1:31:49] this way, legalism, religion, creeds,
[1:31:51] dogmas, it's all about controlling
[1:31:53] access to God. If you'll worship this
[1:31:55] way, you'll have access to God. Well, if
[1:31:57] you shout, if you dance, if you speak in
[1:31:59] tongues, if you do that, that's all
[1:32:01] good. That's all fine. But what they do
[1:32:02] is they say, "If you'll do this, we'll
[1:32:04] give you access to God." But Jesus says,
[1:32:06] "No, I'm going to give you access to
[1:32:08] God. That's why you're going to worship.
[1:32:11] That's why you're going to shout. You're
[1:32:12] not doing it to get access. You're doing
[1:32:14] it because I have given you access. He's
[1:32:17] a high priest. He's the forerunner into
[1:32:20] the holy place. If he's the forerunner,
[1:32:22] that means other people come in
[1:32:24] afterwards. We have access by one spirit
[1:32:28] to the father through Jesus Christ.
[1:32:30] Amen. I'm not trying to gain access
[1:32:32] today. Hallelujah.
[1:32:35] That's what Easter's about. Amen. I'm
[1:32:37] not trying to gain access. I'm not
[1:32:39] trying to give you access. I'm telling
[1:32:41] you, he's already given you access.
[1:32:44] It's yours. That's why you can worship
[1:32:46] him. That's why you praise him. That's
[1:32:48] why you think of him. You've got
[1:32:50] unlimited access to God Almighty.
[1:32:52] Hallelujah. You know, years ago, I saw
[1:32:55] this book in the Christian bookstore.
[1:32:56] You Now, I'm not against reading books.
[1:32:58] I read all the time, but some of these
[1:32:59] books you got to be careful. Was this
[1:33:01] book about how how to pray till the
[1:33:03] heavens opened? Praying till the heavens
[1:33:05] opened. I'm thinking the heavens opened
[1:33:07] to me when Jesus died and rose again.
[1:33:09] Yes sir. Heaven's already open to me.
[1:33:12] Listen. When the Holy Ghost come on
[1:33:13] Jesus, the heavens were opened. When the
[1:33:16] Holy Ghost come on the church at the day
[1:33:18] of Pentecost, it opened heaven to the
[1:33:21] church. I'm not looking for access. This
[1:33:23] message, this resurrection, this word of
[1:33:26] God, it gives me access.
[1:33:30] Listen, I'm not coming and going. I'm
[1:33:31] going to abide. I'm going to stay in
[1:33:33] that place. I want to abide in the
[1:33:35] chosen place of worship.
[1:33:38] Hallelujah.
[1:33:40] I got a quote for you. This is a longer
[1:33:42] quote. I hope this all right, brother.
[1:33:43] I'm preaching this in the Easter
[1:33:45] Seal. He says, "As Jesus said, go into
[1:33:47] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:33:49] every creature." How far? All the world.
[1:33:51] To who? Every creature. They never yet
[1:33:54] received it. And these signs shall
[1:33:56] follow them that believe. How long? To
[1:33:58] the world. To who? Every creature. He
[1:34:00] says, "These signs follow them in my
[1:34:02] name. They shall cast out devils, speak
[1:34:04] with new tongues. If they taken up a
[1:34:05] deadly thing or a serpent, drink a
[1:34:07] deadly thing, it will not harm them.
[1:34:09] I'll they'll lay their hands on the sick
[1:34:10] and they'll recover. His last commission
[1:34:12] to the church, Marks the 16th chapter,
[1:34:16] he says Paul's ordaining these gifts in
[1:34:18] the church 30 years later and in
[1:34:20] Galatians 1:8, if an angel from heaven
[1:34:22] preaches to you any other gospel than
[1:34:24] this which is already received, see it's
[1:34:26] already been preached, right? He says,
[1:34:28] let him be a curse. I believe that
[1:34:30] Pentecost began without an ending. Amen.
[1:34:35] Well, praise the Lord, somebody.
[1:34:37] I believe it to be every creature, all
[1:34:40] times, at all places that Pentecost
[1:34:43] should remain. The Pentecostal blessing
[1:34:45] should be upon the people. Now, we're
[1:34:47] not talking about denominational
[1:34:48] Pentecost. We're talking about the life
[1:34:50] of God manifested. What happened on the
[1:34:52] day of Pentecost when the tongues of
[1:34:54] fire, they divided themselves upon the
[1:34:56] people? Amen. He says, "What is the
[1:34:58] Pentecostal blessing? It's the
[1:35:01] confirmation of the resurrection.
[1:35:04] You say, "How do I know that he's risen
[1:35:06] from the dead?" Well, it's not because
[1:35:08] of history book declared it or because
[1:35:10] somebody in the government sanctioned
[1:35:11] it. You know it cuz the things he did
[1:35:13] back then. He does today in you.
[1:35:18] See, you're not a student of it only.
[1:35:21] You're a witness of it. That's why Jesus
[1:35:23] said, "You will be my witnesses."
[1:35:27] That means what you got to say about it
[1:35:29] is evidence in court. And then you're on
[1:35:32] trial. Like, listen, I know. I don't
[1:35:35] just believe. I know he's risen from the
[1:35:37] dead. Cuz when I was sick and the
[1:35:39] doctors gave up on me, something
[1:35:42] happened. When I was at my lowest and
[1:35:45] nobody loved me, somebody spoke to me.
[1:35:47] That wasn't me. I couldn't make these
[1:35:49] things happen. I couldn't forel these
[1:35:51] things. Somebody did
[1:35:54] it. There's something in your life that
[1:35:57] no one else can explain. It's got to be
[1:35:59] Jesus.
[1:36:02] The Pentecostal blessing. It wasn't here
[1:36:04] today gone tomorrow. It's for all people
[1:36:07] at all times. It is the confirmation
[1:36:11] of the resurrection.
[1:36:14] He says no wonder gospel itself means
[1:36:16] good news. Good news of what? He has
[1:36:19] raised from the dead.
[1:36:22] Let me tell you some bad news. Bad news
[1:36:24] is Adam fell. Bad news is the woman
[1:36:26] fell. Bad news is we were born in sin,
[1:36:29] shaped in iniquity. come to the world
[1:36:31] speaking lies. Not a hope, not a prayer,
[1:36:33] not a chance in the world, nothing you
[1:36:35] could do about it, nothing you ever
[1:36:37] could do. Well, that's the bad news.
[1:36:39] You're in a bad situation. The bad news
[1:36:41] is it's just going to get worse. But the
[1:36:43] good news is there's one that can turn
[1:36:46] the tide. There's one that has come and
[1:36:50] he's changed the
[1:36:51] situation. It's a confirmation of the
[1:36:55] resurrection.
[1:36:57] He says good news of this. He's raised
[1:36:59] from the dead. Because I live, ye live
[1:37:02] also. Ye which were once dead in sins
[1:37:04] and trespasses, God has quickened us
[1:37:06] together by that spirit raised up Jesus
[1:37:09] from the dead. And we are now. Somebody
[1:37:11] say now. Now. We are now sitting in
[1:37:15] heavenly places with him, communing with
[1:37:18] him,
[1:37:20] talking with him. What a Oh my, what a
[1:37:23] joy to tell people that story. Amen.
[1:37:27] Well, I sure hope it is. So good. I hope
[1:37:30] you like telling that story. I hope it
[1:37:32] don't embarrass us too much.
[1:37:35] Hope it doesn't inconvenience us too
[1:37:37] much. What a joy to tell people that
[1:37:40] story that believes to be the truth.
[1:37:42] Now, there's a quote here. We hear it
[1:37:43] all the time and it's sandwiched in
[1:37:44] here. This is why I'm reading the whole
[1:37:46] thing for context. He says, "I'm
[1:37:48] wondering today what is happening?" He
[1:37:49] says, "Are we really getting people to
[1:37:51] God or are we just getting them to
[1:37:54] church?" Right. That's the truth. He
[1:37:56] said, "We must get them to Christ where
[1:37:58] this quickening power." It's good to go
[1:38:00] to church. Thank you for coming. By the
[1:38:03] way, this is a little less awkward than
[1:38:04] preaching to three people. And I've done
[1:38:05] that before. And I don't mind doing
[1:38:07] that. But I'm just saying it's nice to
[1:38:08] see you all. You all look nice today.
[1:38:11] It's good to go to church. It's fine.
[1:38:14] No, I I I love You know, when I first
[1:38:17] come in the Can I just drop this in
[1:38:19] here? When I first come in the message,
[1:38:20] you know, Brother Brand, he's very
[1:38:22] careful to qualify things, especially as
[1:38:24] the ministry goes on. I'm like, man,
[1:38:26] he's being real careful. Well, let me
[1:38:27] say as a person that's preached for
[1:38:28] several years now. I get it because it's
[1:38:31] very easy to say something. Everyone's,
[1:38:32] "Well, you meant this." No, no, hold up.
[1:38:34] Not advocating what you're, you know,
[1:38:36] people take something and they run with
[1:38:38] it. Oh, yeah. So, all the time, well,
[1:38:41] listen, we're not against shouting, but
[1:38:42] that don't save you. Listen, you're
[1:38:44] qualifying that because somebody
[1:38:45] somewhere is gonna say, "Well, see, we
[1:38:46] don't believe in shouting anymore.
[1:38:47] That's that's Pentecost. That's not
[1:38:49] Pentecost. That's the oldest kind they
[1:38:51] got.
[1:38:53] We're not against that. But lots of
[1:38:54] people shout about lots of things. Oh,
[1:38:56] yeah.
[1:38:58] Amen. So, you got to super qualify
[1:39:00] everything, right? You know why? Cuz the
[1:39:02] devil's up right there. Yeah. Well,
[1:39:04] that's what he meant. Well, maybe he
[1:39:06] meant what he said.
[1:39:09] There's a thought. Maybe I meant what I
[1:39:11] said.
[1:39:13] Well, glory to God. Amen.
[1:39:17] Boy, I could get in a lot of trouble
[1:39:20] here. Glory to God. Is it getting hot in
[1:39:23] here? What's the temperature? Turn the
[1:39:25] AC up. No, it's all right. He says we
[1:39:29] must get them to Christ where this
[1:39:31] quick. It's good to go to church. If
[1:39:32] that's as far as we go, it's not far
[1:39:34] enough. That's right. When you come to
[1:39:37] church, that's good. But go on to Christ
[1:39:39] from the church. We must receive this
[1:39:41] quickening power if we ever expect to be
[1:39:43] in that general resurrection because
[1:39:45] that's it's the only thing that will
[1:39:47] ever bring us from the dead. For if this
[1:39:49] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:39:51] dead dwell in you, it'll also quicken,
[1:39:54] make, bring to life your mortal bodies.
[1:39:56] What a promise to us. Notice now the
[1:40:00] very essence of this resurrection is to
[1:40:02] tell and to show, right? And to prove
[1:40:07] that Jesus has raised up from the dead.
[1:40:09] Amen.
[1:40:11] He's not dead. He's a living. He lives
[1:40:14] here. He's in us. I'll be with you even
[1:40:17] in you a little while and the world
[1:40:19] seeth me no more. Yet ye shall see me.
[1:40:22] For I will be with you even in you until
[1:40:24] the end of church to the end of the day
[1:40:28] to the end of the world. He says
[1:40:34] now I'm going to come back a second. The
[1:40:35] very essence of the resurrection is to
[1:40:36] show and to tell. Amen. In other words,
[1:40:39] it's not real resurrection unless it's
[1:40:40] it's proving itself or showing itself.
[1:40:43] Amen. Now, he says this. Now, as
[1:40:45] Christians, we all claim he is alive,
[1:40:48] right? Or been we've been quicken
[1:40:50] quickened from life from death to life
[1:40:51] by his spirit. If we haven't been
[1:40:53] quickened, we've not been made alive.
[1:40:55] Now, we're going to break into this
[1:40:56] subject. The Lord willing kind of teach
[1:40:57] it for a few minutes. How that are we
[1:40:59] quickened? Can we be sure that this is
[1:41:01] the truth? He says, now this is your own
[1:41:03] life. This is my life. It's where he
[1:41:05] says, "If this isn't the truth, what I'm
[1:41:08] fixing to say, then I'm one of the most
[1:41:10] foolish people in the world." Wow.
[1:41:13] Amen. That's what Paul said. If we're
[1:41:15] the most miserable people, if this is
[1:41:16] all a lie. Amen. This is not a well, it
[1:41:19] seemed convenient at the time sort of a
[1:41:21] thing. This is all or nothing.
[1:41:24] We're either all the way in or we're all
[1:41:25] the way out. Don't do no good to ride
[1:41:27] the fence, so stop doing it anyway.
[1:41:29] You're either all sold out on this or
[1:41:31] you're not. He says, "If it isn't the
[1:41:33] truth, what I'm fixing to say is I'm one
[1:41:35] of the most foolish people in the world.
[1:41:37] I've give my life for something there's
[1:41:39] nothing to, and so have you. But if it's
[1:41:41] the truth, then I owe everything I am."
[1:41:45] Amen.
[1:41:46] I owe everything that I could be to the
[1:41:49] cause of which we're standing for. And I
[1:41:52] think we mustn't lose our enthusiasm. I
[1:41:56] told you I'd come back to it.
[1:41:58] Amen. No.
[1:42:02] Yeah,
[1:42:04] we mustn't lose our enthu. Now listen,
[1:42:07] the essence of the resurrection is to
[1:42:08] show and to tell and to prove. And so he
[1:42:11] says, so we mustn't lose our enthusiasm.
[1:42:12] And that's that's my challenge for us
[1:42:14] today.
[1:42:16] When we talk about the gospel, does it
[1:42:20] still excite us like it used to?
[1:42:24] Does it still have the meaning to us
[1:42:25] that it used to? Amen.
[1:42:28] See, we've if we've seen a risen savior,
[1:42:30] Amen. Are we running to tell people what
[1:42:33] we've seen in Christ? Are we busy
[1:42:35] telling about all the other stuff we've
[1:42:36] seen? My favorite preacher, my favorite
[1:42:38] church, my favorite this, me and my, and
[1:42:40] this.
[1:42:42] Amen. Well, praise. You don't have to
[1:42:44] get that quiet on me.
[1:42:47] We become, if we're not careful, we
[1:42:49] become, let me say it this way. Amen.
[1:42:51] It's very easy for human beings to be
[1:42:54] impressed by what we can do.
[1:42:57] And we don't really do a whole lot. We
[1:43:01] just think that we do. We just believe,
[1:43:04] oh man, that guy, he, you know, he shot
[1:43:08] a basketball and good for that guy. He's
[1:43:10] making a million dollars. If I could put
[1:43:11] a ball in a hoop and make a million
[1:43:13] dollars, I'd be doing that. Not right
[1:43:14] now, but sometime during the week. Amen.
[1:43:17] Listen, good for him. Amen. But we exalt
[1:43:19] the achievement a minute. If we're not
[1:43:20] careful, we do it in a church. Amen.
[1:43:22] Preachers will do it with themselves.
[1:43:24] God will begin to use him a little bit.
[1:43:27] Well, listen, I'm not saying anything
[1:43:28] new. Brother B talks about it. God will
[1:43:29] take a man. That's why brother B said
[1:43:31] it's so hard for God to find a man he
[1:43:33] can use that won't exalt himself.
[1:43:36] See, God begin to use a man. God begin
[1:43:38] to use a church. God begin to use a
[1:43:39] people. And if we're not careful, well,
[1:43:42] we're message believers and we're the
[1:43:43] best this and we're the best that. And
[1:43:45] it wasn't you that did it in the first
[1:43:47] place.
[1:43:49] Well, this is what I'm coming to to
[1:43:51] bring my point back around. Listen, when
[1:43:52] you're sufficiently impressed with the
[1:43:55] finished work of Calvary, you cease to
[1:43:57] be impressed by what a man can do. You
[1:44:00] cease to be impressed by what you can
[1:44:02] do. Amen. You don't look at your own
[1:44:04] achievement, your own ability. Well,
[1:44:05] listen. I'm better than the next guy and
[1:44:07] I'm more holy and I'm all the insecurity
[1:44:10] and the vanity and the pride. It
[1:44:12] disappears because when you look at what
[1:44:14] God has done, you say, "Who can compare?
[1:44:18] What could any of us do in a lifetime
[1:44:20] that could compare to what God did that
[1:44:23] day, that morning when he raised Christ
[1:44:25] from the dead? Nothing compares. Nothing
[1:44:29] comes close.
[1:44:31] And the things of men, the things of our
[1:44:33] own ego, our ideas, they cease to
[1:44:36] impress us in the light of what God has
[1:44:38] done.
[1:44:41] Amen. And if we're not careful, we
[1:44:43] become enthusiastic about all these
[1:44:44] other things.
[1:44:47] And we miss the main thing.
[1:44:50] So Easter's a good reminder. Don't
[1:44:51] forget the main thing.
[1:44:54] You got a nice church. The air is colder
[1:44:56] than it is someplace, you know. Got a
[1:44:58] nice building, nice people. Find people.
[1:45:00] Some of the best people in the world
[1:45:01] sitting right here this this morning.
[1:45:02] Amen. But it's all because of Jesus
[1:45:05] Christ.
[1:45:07] It's not a preacher. It's not me.
[1:45:09] Listen, I I'm not taking any credit. You
[1:45:12] know, you come up, brother, that really
[1:45:13] helped me. That was God. That's not me.
[1:45:14] And I'm not saying that to be fake
[1:45:16] humble. I mean it from the bottom. I
[1:45:18] ain't got nothing for you.
[1:45:20] Amen. I ain't got nothing for you. But
[1:45:23] there's good news. There's one that
[1:45:26] does.
[1:45:27] I'm not him. I'm I'm like John. I'm just
[1:45:30] bearing witness of it. I'm just telling
[1:45:32] you what he's done for me. I'm just
[1:45:35] telling you what he's done for you.
[1:45:38] And that should be an enthusiasm to us.
[1:45:40] Amen. That
[1:45:42] the Lord. Amen. You know, Brother Ram
[1:45:44] was talking to Paris Reed Head one day
[1:45:46] and this guy I think he was the uh he I
[1:45:49] think it was a Baptist was in charge of
[1:45:51] some missions or something or whatever.
[1:45:52] I can't remember right now, but he was
[1:45:53] talking to Paris Reedhead about that and
[1:45:55] and he you know he's talking about I
[1:45:56] think it was in the trial but he looked
[1:45:58] at them Pentecostals down there and how
[1:46:00] they were carrying on and kicking the
[1:46:01] chairs over and this and that and
[1:46:02] brother Reed had asked brother said do
[1:46:04] you think that's a you think that's the
[1:46:05] Lord? He's like well yeah I don't I
[1:46:07] don't believe it's not the Lord you know
[1:46:09] I I just they don't know what they're
[1:46:10] doing with it. Amen. And he says, 'Well,
[1:46:12] I hear you're associating with them
[1:46:13] Pentecostals. And brother said, 'Yes,
[1:46:14] sir. I am one of them. Amen. Well,
[1:46:17] praise the
[1:46:18] Lord. And and Paris Street, well, do you
[1:46:20] think that's the Holy Spirit? He said,
[1:46:21] 'Yes, sir. And that gentleman, he said,
[1:46:23] "Well, I can't understand why they have
[1:46:25] all that screaming and shouting and
[1:46:26] going on like that." And brother Bam
[1:46:28] makes this point. He says, "Listen, if
[1:46:29] you can't put the steam to roll on a
[1:46:31] wheel, a wheel, it'll blow out the
[1:46:33] whistle somewhere." Amen. So, Brother
[1:46:35] Bam says, "That's why I'm with them."
[1:46:39] Amen. They've got something. He's not
[1:46:43] denying.
[1:46:44] Oh, them Pentecost is all worked up.
[1:46:46] It's just all No, they've got something.
[1:46:48] They just don't know what to do with it.
[1:46:53] Amen. That's why I'm with him. He said,
[1:46:55] if you could only get that thing in
[1:46:56] operation and that enthusiasm moving out
[1:46:59] yonder to win souls, it would conquer
[1:47:02] the world. That's why I'm there. He
[1:47:05] said,
[1:47:06] "Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. In
[1:47:08] other words, he didn't come do away with
[1:47:10] their shouting, their worship, their
[1:47:11] praise. But it doesn't do any good if it
[1:47:13] doesn't go out of the building.
[1:47:17] If the resurrection just stays in a
[1:47:19] garden somewhere in Israel and you got
[1:47:20] to go there, it don't do you no good.
[1:47:21] That's right. Amen. That's good
[1:47:24] preaching. Amen. Amen. So, he's not
[1:47:27] doing away with your enthusiasm. He
[1:47:28] wants you to have enthusiasm, but what
[1:47:30] are you doing with your enthusiasm?
[1:47:32] Amen.
[1:47:34] If you know that Christ has risen from
[1:47:35] the dead, what are you doing with it?
[1:47:36] said, "Amen." Well, let me tell you what
[1:47:38] Jesus did with it. Amen. When Jesus rose
[1:47:40] from the dead, he didn't keep it a
[1:47:41] secret. Well, don't tell anybody. I
[1:47:44] don't want people to know that I've
[1:47:45] overcome hell, death, and the grave. I
[1:47:47] don't want people to know that I'm alive
[1:47:49] again. No, I said go tell my disciples.
[1:47:51] Go tell these Go tell everybody. Get all
[1:47:54] excited. Go tell
[1:47:56] everybody Jesus Christ is king. Amen. He
[1:47:59] appears to 500. He appears to guys on
[1:48:01] the road. He's showing up everywhere.
[1:48:03] Let them know, "Hey, guess what? I'm not
[1:48:07] dead.
[1:48:08] I'm alive and I'm alive forever more.
[1:48:14] What should you do with it? The same
[1:48:16] thing. As the father sent me, so send
[1:48:20] you. Go tell somebody. Don't just sit on
[1:48:23] it. Don't just be a secret about it. Let
[1:48:26] somebody know.
[1:48:30] Glory to God. Listen, God did not just
[1:48:33] give us the Here we are. He did not just
[1:48:35] give us the gospel for us to sit around
[1:48:37] and have big meetings and get excited
[1:48:40] and touch on how holy and awesome and
[1:48:41] excited and powerful and anointed we are
[1:48:43] and then it just stays in the tent,
[1:48:45] stays in the church, stays in the
[1:48:46] building, and we never take it out
[1:48:48] anywhere.
[1:48:50] Go ye into all the world.
[1:48:53] Preach the gospel to every creature.
[1:48:55] Well, praise the Lord. Listen, if you're
[1:48:57] going to be a witness to me, you got to
[1:48:58] tell somebody.
[1:49:01] Now, now this is where I get in trouble.
[1:49:03] Maybe I've used this before. I don't
[1:49:05] This is where I get in trouble. You
[1:49:06] know, there's there's testimonies and
[1:49:07] there's testimonies.
[1:49:09] There's some testimonies. They're good
[1:49:10] church testimonies. Amen. You you some
[1:49:13] sister in church, she comes up. Well,
[1:49:15] you know, I was just really discouraged
[1:49:16] the other day and and I went to the gas
[1:49:18] station and and gas was 213. I thought
[1:49:21] that's my house address. And I knew that
[1:49:23] God cared about that's great, but don't
[1:49:26] don't tell the guy on the street that.
[1:49:27] He's going to think you're nuts.
[1:49:30] That's so good. I'm not. That is so
[1:49:33] good. We don't think about who we're
[1:49:35] talking to. Well, listen. This this
[1:49:37] thing that did that means only one thing
[1:49:38] to me. I'm going
[1:49:42] That's that good church testimony. And
[1:49:44] probably they'll clap for you cuz
[1:49:46] message people are too nice.
[1:49:52] I tell you, I get myself is so good. How
[1:49:55] do I How do I get out of this lion's
[1:49:57] den? Lord,
[1:50:00] think about who you're talking to,
[1:50:02] right?
[1:50:03] Well, I'm going to talk to this guy at
[1:50:05] work and he's sick. Well, don't tell him
[1:50:06] about how God gave you a new car.
[1:50:10] I mean, that's fine. I got a new thing.
[1:50:11] Praise God. That's not where he's at,
[1:50:14] right? It's not good news if it doesn't
[1:50:17] pertain to situation.
[1:50:21] Hey, I know you're sick, but guess what?
[1:50:23] I know a guy at my church that was going
[1:50:25] through the same thing and we had See,
[1:50:27] now that's what I'm talking about.
[1:50:28] That's the testimony of a true witness.
[1:50:30] Amen. There's got to be Well, praise the
[1:50:32] Lord. Amen. We'll go around and we'll
[1:50:34] we'll tell stories. Amen. Like there's
[1:50:37] some value to it.
[1:50:41] But to be a witness, there's got to be
[1:50:42] something that strikes home. Amen. You
[1:50:44] see what I'm saying? I'm not saying that
[1:50:46] other testimony is invaluable. I'm
[1:50:47] saying it doesn't mean anything to that
[1:50:48] person. Amen. So, brother, let me say
[1:50:52] this. Brother says this. He says this,
[1:50:53] and I'm going to read a quote. That's
[1:50:55] how I'm going to get out of this. I'm
[1:50:55] just going
[1:50:56] to Brother Bam says this in witnesses
[1:50:59] 1953. Sometimes when you witness for
[1:51:01] God, you have to suffer a little bit. He
[1:51:04] said, "You remember when mother told you
[1:51:05] you couldn't stay around home or as long
[1:51:06] as you read the Bible and carried up?"
[1:51:08] Now, I I don't know if there's there's
[1:51:09] people like that. I know. They got
[1:51:11] kicked out of their house because they
[1:51:12] believe the message, they believe the
[1:51:13] gospel. He said, "You remember when
[1:51:15] mother told you you couldn't stay at
[1:51:17] home as long as you read the Bible and
[1:51:18] carried on? Or some neighbor said, some
[1:51:20] children said at school you was a
[1:51:21] fanatic or something because you was a
[1:51:23] true witness? Remember on the job how
[1:51:25] all the men laughed at you because you
[1:51:26] was a real witness? How on the streets
[1:51:28] you were made fun of when you give a
[1:51:29] testimony?" He says, "But that's a
[1:51:32] genuine sign of a real true witness."
[1:51:34] God wants witnesses. Now some people
[1:51:36] say, "I testify in church." That's good.
[1:51:42] It's like you're shouting. It's good.
[1:51:45] Nothing against that. I testify in
[1:51:46] church. That's good. But brother, let
[1:51:48] your light shine in the dark places
[1:51:52] where it's really needed. Out in the
[1:51:54] hedges, in the highways, in the
[1:51:56] barrooms. I don't know who's going to
[1:51:58] the barroom, but
[1:52:01] stand
[1:52:02] outside. Oh, I didn't realize I was at
[1:52:04] the Eagles. Well, now that I'm here, get
[1:52:06] saved.
[1:52:10] down the street, everywhere you're at,
[1:52:12] let your light shine as a witness. See,
[1:52:15] what I'm saying is sometimes you'll be
[1:52:17] the one that goes by the Mary in the
[1:52:19] garden. She's going through something
[1:52:21] and that's when you got to be a witness.
[1:52:22] Amen. It's not just always all here.
[1:52:24] Amen.
[1:52:28] Somebody's going through something like
[1:52:29] Mary. And you can testify to that person
[1:52:33] like Jesus did to her, like Jesus did to
[1:52:35] us. You might be in a bad situation, but
[1:52:37] he won't leave you there. Amen.
[1:52:40] What you're going through now, there's a
[1:52:42] reason for it. But at the end of the
[1:52:45] tunnel, at the end of it all, there's an
[1:52:47] answer. Amen. There's got to be an
[1:52:50] answer. Job knew there had to be an
[1:52:52] answer. If a tree's cut down, there's
[1:52:55] hope that living. What about man? God
[1:52:57] had the answer.
[1:53:00] There's a way out.
[1:53:02] You might be in a bad spot today. Maybe
[1:53:03] you're not. I hope you're not, but you
[1:53:05] might be. But if you're there today, he
[1:53:07] won't leave you there. Amen.
[1:53:10] He's given us access to the holy place.
[1:53:13] Whatever your need is, you can have
[1:53:15] boldness, right? In the time of need.
[1:53:18] Amen. You're not scared. Well, what am I
[1:53:21] going to do? You know where to go. Amen.
[1:53:23] Amen. God bless you today. Why don't we
[1:53:25] stand to our feet? I want to encourage
[1:53:27] you today to Oh, I said that again. See,
[1:53:30] look at that. I want to discourage you
[1:53:34] enough not to lose your enthusiasm.
[1:53:37] Amen.
[1:53:40] To be a witness to somebody.
[1:53:43] When you go out of here, that's when the
[1:53:44] witnessing begins. Amen. Now, I would
[1:53:48] encourage you to invite somebody to
[1:53:49] church for Easter, but we're
[1:53:52] here. But, uh, maybe go tell somebody
[1:53:56] you haven't told before. Tell them about
[1:53:57] what the Lord did in your life. Amen.
[1:54:00] That's what Easter's about.
[1:54:03] Telling somebody he's risen. Amen. Now,
[1:54:06] there's a right way and a wrong way to
[1:54:09] do that. That was my point earlier.
[1:54:10] Amen. You don't have to badger him to
[1:54:12] death or whatever. Amen. But let your
[1:54:15] light so shine.
[1:54:17] Amen. Find find some place. You know,
[1:54:21] brother, get somebody on the platform.
[1:54:23] You'll talk to him and he'll tell you,
[1:54:25] "Well, I'm talking because I'm trying to
[1:54:27] contact their spirit." Now, now, if you
[1:54:28] don't know what that's about, pray about
[1:54:30] it. Amen. Because it's entering into
[1:54:32] where somebody's at, meeting them where
[1:54:34] they're at. Amen. That's what God did
[1:54:35] for us. We couldn't get to him, so he
[1:54:39] came to us. Are you glad today?
[1:54:43] I believe God is speaking. I believe God
[1:54:46] is trying to deal with our lives. And
[1:54:48] it's like Mary, if we'll just wait a
[1:54:50] little bit on him. There's something for
[1:54:52] you today. Amen. Why don't we sing this
[1:54:54] song?
[1:54:55] Uh, I think it's the key of
[1:54:59] C.
[1:55:01] Amen. Let's sing this song together. I
[1:55:04] come to the
[1:55:07] garden
[1:55:13] alone while the
[1:55:17] dew is still on the
[1:55:25] roses and the
[1:55:28] voice I
[1:55:31] hear falling
[1:55:33] on my ear.
[1:55:37] The
[1:55:39] son of
[1:55:42] God gets
[1:55:49] close.
[1:55:51] And he
[1:55:54] walks with me. And he
[1:55:59] talks with me.
[1:56:03] And he
[1:56:05] tells me I am his
[1:56:13] own. And the
[1:56:16] joy we
[1:56:19] share as we
[1:56:22] dare be there.
[1:56:26] none
[1:56:28] other can
[1:56:31] ever
[1:56:33] know. Oh, I like this right here.
[1:56:37] He speaks and the sound of his
[1:56:46] voice is so
[1:56:49] sweet that all the birds hush their
[1:56:57] singing and the
[1:57:03] me that he gave
[1:57:06] to
[1:57:08] me
[1:57:11] within. Is it still ringing today? Amen.
[1:57:14] Hallelujah. It's
[1:57:16] [Applause]
[1:57:17] [Music]
[1:57:20] ringing
[1:57:22] and he
[1:57:25] walks with Hallelujah.
[1:57:28] And he
[1:57:31] talks with
[1:57:33] me. And he
[1:57:36] tells me I am his own.
[1:57:46] And the
[1:57:47] joy that we share as we
[1:57:53] dare brea
[1:57:56] there none
[1:57:59] other can't
[1:58:02] ever know. Oh my. Here we go now. Well,
[1:58:08] I'd stay in the
[1:58:13] garden with him.
[1:58:19] Oh, the
[1:58:21] night all around
[1:58:25] me be falling.
[1:58:31] But he
[1:58:32] bids me
[1:58:35] go through the
[1:58:38] voice of
[1:58:41] wo his
[1:58:43] voice to
[1:58:46] me is
[1:58:53] calling
[1:58:55] and he
[1:58:58] walks with me. And he
[1:59:03] talks with
[1:59:06] me and he
[1:59:09] tells me I am his own.
[1:59:18] And the
[1:59:20] joy we
[1:59:22] share as we
[1:59:25] tear re
[1:59:29] there now
[1:59:32] [Music]
[1:59:35] another just play that softly as we
[1:59:38] pray. Let's let's bow our heads Jesus.
[1:59:40] Oh
[1:59:43] Godlujah. I think back to a night where
[1:59:46] I was like Mary in that
[1:59:48] garden. Oh Lord, I was so
[1:59:53] [Music]
[1:59:55] desperate for my own situation. But this
[1:59:59] woman, she just wanted to know, they've
[2:00:02] taken my Lord. Where have they taken
[2:00:05] him? Oh
[2:00:08] God, you were there all the
[2:00:11] time. You were there to receive her.
[2:00:14] You were there to be a help to her,
[2:00:16] Lord, in that garden. Just you and her.
[2:00:19] I pray today, Lord, for each of us,
[2:00:21] wherever we're at, whatever we're going
[2:00:23] through. It might just it might just be
[2:00:26] one person,
[2:00:27] Lord. We can sit in a church full of
[2:00:30] people. We can stand and praise the
[2:00:33] Lord. We can have friends and family
[2:00:35] surround us. And yet in our hearts, we
[2:00:38] feel so alone.
[2:00:41] We feel so forsaken at times, but Lord,
[2:00:45] you're here today. I I pray for that
[2:00:47] one. If they're discouraged, I pray for
[2:00:49] that one. Whatever they're going
[2:00:50] through, Lord, it might be the hardest
[2:00:53] day. They might not have they might have
[2:00:55] struggled just to make it today. It
[2:00:58] might have taken everything within them
[2:00:59] just to get here. Lord, may you just say
[2:01:03] something. Speak to them
[2:01:05] now. Lord, give them some strength.
[2:01:08] Hallelujah. Give them strength to
[2:01:10] realize you're here, that you're alive,
[2:01:13] and it means everything to us. Bless
[2:01:15] these people. We pray. Father, help us
[2:01:17] to be real witnesses, Lord, of the
[2:01:20] resurrection. To go tell somebody how
[2:01:22] our candle got lit. To tell somebody
[2:01:24] what you mean to us, Lord. We love you,
[2:01:26] Lord. We thank you. We're nothing
[2:01:28] without you, oh
[2:01:30] God. And I want the world to

[2:01:35] done for me because you'll do it for
[2:01:36] them. Help your children I pray today

[2:02:29] person next to you is to God. And it's
[2:02:31] so easy to forget that. But don't ever
[2:02:33] take that for granted. Lord, help me.
[2:02:36] Help each one of us
[2:02:39] not to take each other for granted. God
