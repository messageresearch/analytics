[32:09] [Music]
[32:11] lord just be so yielded
[32:15] for your way to your way lord
[32:19] your god we don't claim in ourselves to
[32:22] be able
[32:24] lord to do that alone we need the
[32:27] unction of the holy spirit
[32:31] lord it's the desire from our hearts
[32:33] [Music]
[32:34] lord you placed that desire within us
[32:38] you quickened that lord and made it a
[32:40] living reality
[32:44] but lord you're still the longing
[32:47] of our life lord or we're not longing
[32:51] to be born again
[32:54] lord jesus we've been born again by the
[32:57] spirit of god
[32:58] but there's a longing lord in her heart
[33:02] for more of you lord
[33:05] that more of us lord would be
[33:08] surrendered
[33:10] to more of you i pray that lord that
[33:14] you'll just
[33:16] have your way lord may you just come
[33:19] lord help us just to step aside for
[33:22] these few moments
[33:25] the lord what is said
[33:29] what we would hear that your god
[33:32] it's you that lord that you'll come
[33:36] we have an utmost confidence lord that
[33:38] as the word
[33:40] is going forth in this word
[33:44] is created power oh god and as we
[33:47] receive that word
[33:49] we become the word so lord we ask oh god
[33:54] that you would have your way minister to
[33:57] the needs
[33:58] what's on the hearts of your children
[34:00] tonight may you just come in a special
[34:03] way let it be just a real personal time
[34:06] lord between each one of us and you
[34:09] we just lord give ourselves to you as
[34:12] that you would just have your way now in
[34:14] every part that's
[34:15] remaining in the service in the name of
[34:17] jesus christ amen
[34:21] amen god bless you tonight amen let's
[34:24] turn in our bibles to first
[34:26] corinthians chapter 13 verse four thank
[34:32] you
[34:35] we'll just read this verse of scripture
[34:41] and verse 4
[34:45] charity suffereth long and is kind
[34:50] charity envieth not and it vaunteth not
[34:54] itself and is not puffed up
[34:58] may god bless you bless the reading of
[35:00] the word as you're being seated
[35:04] you know in in reality when we
[35:07] look at any any place within the word of
[35:10] god
[35:12] there there's no stopping point
[35:15] within the word it only comes to a place
[35:19] that
[35:20] like as paul would
[35:24] give counsel to timothy the instant in
[35:27] season and out of season
[35:29] and to know by the leading of the lord
[35:33] where to journey when enough has been
[35:36] said
[35:36] when to move on so we just we
[35:39] we always look at that within the word
[35:42] because as we see
[35:43] even in this portion of the scripture
[35:46] we're looking at
[35:47] there's so many things that the lord has
[35:49] just been
[35:51] unpacking within this and there's things
[35:55] that
[35:56] as i said we you could you could just
[35:58] continue on and you see over and over
[36:01] how that
[36:01] there are things that as we go through
[36:03] it that there's just always an
[36:05] overlapping because
[36:06] the scripture says it's true that no
[36:09] scripture
[36:10] is of any private or isolated
[36:14] interpretation so it must scripture
[36:17] must come to scripture word must come to
[36:20] word
[36:20] precept must come to precept and that's
[36:23] a working of the spirit of truth that's
[36:26] why the working of the holy ghost in our
[36:28] life
[36:29] by himself is a word experience
[36:33] it brings us into the word to where that
[36:36] our lives
[36:37] themselves are then becomes a reflection
[36:40] of the word to where
[36:42] our our basis and our resting and our
[36:44] delight
[36:45] is upon is in him so as we look at this
[36:49] this portion of the word
[36:51] as it says it vaunteth not itself and i
[36:54] want to just look at that just a little
[36:56] bit more here tonight
[36:58] and see how far we can get with this but
[37:00] it deals with
[37:01] not being boastful or vainglorious or
[37:05] empty glory it deals with where
[37:09] there is sometimes of of a place that as
[37:12] we can say
[37:13] charity itself it doesn't draw attention
[37:16] to itself
[37:18] or if we can say it in this manner it
[37:20] doesn't draw attention
[37:21] to the vessel that it is higher housed
[37:24] in
[37:24] but real charity it seeks
[37:28] to honor and to glorify almighty god
[37:32] and so this is this is really the desire
[37:35] that that really that charity would
[37:37] operate by is to see
[37:39] the lord jesus glorified in all things
[37:42] paul would write of this and just to
[37:44] pick up one of the places here
[37:46] in the book of ephesians chapter 3 verse
[37:49] 20
[37:49] and paul says now unto him that is able
[37:53] to do exceedingly above all that we
[37:56] can ask or think according to the power
[38:00] that worketh in us unto
[38:04] him be glory in the church
[38:07] by christ jesus throughout all ages
[38:10] world without end amen
[38:14] so in everything that is done within the
[38:17] church of the living god or we can say
[38:19] even in our own lives is to be unto the
[38:23] glory
[38:24] of jesus christ sometimes that isn't
[38:27] always in what we say
[38:28] sometimes it's the times when we refrain
[38:30] from saying anything
[38:32] that he is allowed to be glorified
[38:36] and so we we recognize that it's his
[38:39] power
[38:39] that works within us it's not as we were
[38:42] looking at that last week it's
[38:43] nothing that we can take credit for on
[38:46] our own self
[38:48] when you really begin to look at things
[38:50] you can't even say oh my
[38:52] yes i prayed and and this came to pass
[38:55] and
[38:55] you know i prayed about this and this
[38:57] happened but it wasn't you
[39:00] the reality of it is is god gave you
[39:02] grace to go
[39:03] into prayer to trust him that for what
[39:07] he has already said in his word
[39:09] ask the father anything in my name that
[39:11] he might be glorified
[39:13] in the son of god so it becomes in that
[39:17] in that measure and as we're looking
[39:18] that it all comes back to it's god
[39:21] that's given us grace to even approach
[39:23] things
[39:24] in prayer it's the grace of god that
[39:26] even allows us to examine our own
[39:29] faults and our own weakness and our own
[39:31] shortcomings that's the grace of god
[39:34] so when we look at this i want to go to
[39:37] matthew
[39:38] chapter 17 and here is a setting
[39:42] where we find as the scripture says
[39:44] after six days
[39:45] jesus took peter james and john and his
[39:48] brother
[39:49] and he brought them up into a high
[39:51] mountain apart
[39:52] and was transfigured before them
[39:55] and his face did shine as the sun and as
[39:59] rainment
[39:59] was white as the light this was an
[40:01] adoption ceremony
[40:03] this is a placing ceremony this is a
[40:05] positioning ceremony
[40:07] and and he says behold there appeared
[40:10] unto them
[40:10] moses and elijah talking with him
[40:14] then answered peter and said unto jesus
[40:17] lord it is good for us to be here if
[40:20] thou
[40:21] wilt let us make here three tabernacles
[40:25] i want you to catch this peter peter
[40:28] is here in the moment and he's looking
[40:30] at what's taking place and he's just
[40:32] he's caught up in this reality and here
[40:36] is moses here is elijah speaking with
[40:39] the lord jesus
[40:40] as it records in the book of luke
[40:42] concerning his
[40:43] his death concerning what is to take
[40:45] place because it's a fulfillment
[40:47] of prophecy that's going to take place
[40:50] he must needs
[40:51] suffer these things and to enter into
[40:54] his glory
[40:55] so here you find the word the prophets
[40:58] and the law
[40:58] all that spoke of christ what has spoke
[41:01] now he stands
[41:03] as the fulfillment where the prophets
[41:05] were only a portion
[41:06] but here he stands the full light
[41:08] himself no longer just
[41:10] a portion of a light but now it is the
[41:13] light itself that's been gathered
[41:15] together
[41:16] not just not just that of the law
[41:19] but now here is the very one who is the
[41:22] law giver himself
[41:23] the one who would would come and and
[41:26] fulfill as he said
[41:28] i will write upon the tables of your
[41:31] heart
[41:32] in your heart and in your mind so now
[41:35] here we find the very one that is
[41:37] scripted
[41:38] inspired moses and scripted it and now
[41:41] here he is
[41:42] he's identified in earth in that of the
[41:45] messiah
[41:46] and now here peter makes this
[41:48] declaration
[41:50] let us make three tabernacles if
[41:53] jesus would allow him to do it things
[41:56] would have continued as they were
[41:58] the law condemns you i don't care how
[42:01] many points you keep of it you're still
[42:03] guilty
[42:04] and the prophets are the justice to
[42:06] declare you're guilty
[42:08] and this is what you have coming but
[42:10] when they made this statement here
[42:13] notice one for moses one for life and
[42:15] we're not going to leave you out jesus
[42:17] we'll make one for you
[42:18] while yet spake behold a bright cloud
[42:21] overshadowed them
[42:23] and behold a voice out of the cloud said
[42:25] this
[42:26] is my beloved son in whom i am well
[42:30] pleased
[42:31] hear ye him and when the disciples heard
[42:35] it
[42:36] they fell on their face and were sore
[42:38] afraid
[42:39] and jesus came and touched them and said
[42:42] arise
[42:43] and be not afraid and when they lifted
[42:46] up their eyes they
[42:47] saw no man save jesus only
[42:50] you see here when the word was declared
[42:54] the cloud comes and out of the cloud
[42:56] comes the voice
[42:57] that it speaks with supreme authority
[43:00] this is my beloved son who is he he is
[43:03] the word
[43:04] hear ye him hear the word
[43:08] the word speaketh better things the word
[43:11] declares what the law couldn't do
[43:13] here is the one who satisfies the
[43:15] requirements of the law
[43:17] where we could not meet the justice of
[43:19] god here is one
[43:20] who can meet the justice of god hear ye
[43:23] him
[43:24] let the word have its work and as this
[43:27] was declared think of the impact
[43:29] of this vision it's the same thing that
[43:31] took place in revelations 1
[43:33] where john was he fell on his feet as
[43:36] dead
[43:36] and a hand came forth and said fear not
[43:39] john
[43:40] i am he that was dead and i'm alive
[43:42] forevermore
[43:44] that's what god has done in this
[43:46] generation
[43:47] this right here in this generation is a
[43:50] repeat
[43:50] of matthew 17 where the word
[43:54] itself that has been coming down through
[43:56] the ages
[43:57] now stands in full power and full glory
[44:01] it's time for the rapture and it's time
[44:03] for israel to receive
[44:05] her visitation so now
[44:09] here you find the request is let us make
[44:12] a tabernace three tabernacles and when
[44:15] we
[44:16] when we look at it now when the
[44:17] declaration comes
[44:19] it just takes a very breath it takes the
[44:21] very life they
[44:22] they are sore afraid but i want you to
[44:25] notice when jesus touched them
[44:27] he told them arise and be not afraid
[44:32] the word told them stand on your feet
[44:34] arise
[44:35] and be not afraid and when they lifted
[44:38] up their head
[44:39] they no longer seen moses and elijah
[44:41] they saw it all
[44:42] met in him they saw
[44:46] jesus only
[44:50] they saw the word himself standing there
[44:53] declaring himself i want to just say
[44:56] this to you
[44:57] who do you see in your life declaring
[44:59] himself
[45:01] it's the word taking the word and
[45:03] declaring the word through you
[45:05] it's not you it's not me it's christ
[45:10] it's god being glorified in sons and
[45:13] daughters of god
[45:14] that is bringing into position by his
[45:17] word
[45:18] and we see no one else say jesus only
[45:22] you don't see a church we see no man say
[45:25] jesus only
[45:26] that's what the real revelation of this
[45:28] word does
[45:29] it brings jesus christ from word to
[45:32] flesh
[45:34] it brings a reality down into the lives
[45:37] of the people
[45:38] that is the same yesterday today and
[45:40] forever
[45:42] [Applause]
[45:44] this mount transfiguration brother
[45:46] branham picks it up
[45:47] and it's the rising of the sun and i
[45:48] want to read from this in this point
[45:51] he said we're just like them at mount
[45:53] transfiguration
[45:55] certainly we do not claim power
[45:59] like he says on mount transfiguration
[46:02] they wasn't saying
[46:03] moses saying see who see who i
[46:06] am the disciples say see who i am see
[46:09] who i
[46:10] am you know what happened he said they
[46:12] seen jesus
[46:13] glorified and that's all they wanted to
[46:17] see
[46:17] represented was jesus glorified
[46:22] and so it is today the guy places this
[46:25] we don't try to be some big person
[46:28] listen this
[46:29] is the holy spirit and the word and the
[46:32] prophet
[46:32] and the bride is one with this this is
[46:36] the motive
[46:36] and objective of christ himself working
[46:40] in the word he's not interested in big
[46:44] big names he's not interested in making
[46:47] who's who
[46:48] he's not interested in that remember the
[46:50] world the world looks for things
[46:53] like like like israel look for saul he
[46:55] was head and shoulders above the rest
[46:57] and
[46:57] my he looked this way and he looked that
[47:00] way even when samuel went to anoint
[47:03] one of jesse's sons remember even samuel
[47:06] god allowing that as we looked at it
[47:07] last week
[47:08] he went to anoint the first one by his
[47:11] looks
[47:13] he knew the right place to go come under
[47:15] the sacrifice
[47:16] and come to the house and anoint him but
[47:19] even in that
[47:20] he's still looking i'm in the right
[47:21] place surely this guy's the guy but you
[47:24] see
[47:24] god already knew about david david would
[47:28] not have been
[47:29] as far as stature the people's choice
[47:31] but
[47:32] in the eyes of god he was god's choice
[47:36] and god declared his choice let me just
[47:39] tell you something
[47:40] that choosing of god upon david's life
[47:43] it
[47:43] trumped his size his readiness and all
[47:46] of his inabilities he could rest
[47:48] had been chosen by god
[47:52] there's not a devil big enough that can
[47:54] stop me from getting to the throne
[47:57] i've been anointed for that position
[48:00] i've been anointed to take a rapture are
[48:02] you with me
[48:03] it wasn't david bragging on himself his
[48:05] confidence
[48:06] in battle was the anointing of the word
[48:09] that was on his life
[48:12] he rested in that anointing with
[48:14] situations or else he could say
[48:16] i've been anointed by the word of a
[48:19] prophet
[48:20] it is god's word and i know who i am
[48:23] and i'm going to make it
[48:25] [Music]
[48:25] [Applause]
[48:30] we don't try to be some big person we
[48:33] don't care what the what the people say
[48:35] about us
[48:36] our name ain't nothing it's his name
[48:41] our life is nothing it's his life
[48:44] it's his power not our power there is
[48:47] only
[48:48] one thing that we love to do is see him
[48:51] glorified
[48:53] and how can it be when he's glorified
[48:56] in us by his resurrection that's in us
[49:00] we see him represented again
[49:04] as he was today
[49:07] that's the glory of a real believer is
[49:10] to see
[49:11] christ represented in our life
[49:14] don't read don't don't don't read into
[49:16] this in your own thinking
[49:18] remember god has called you for a
[49:20] purpose
[49:21] and and you're not to compare yourself
[49:24] to somebody else
[49:25] i'm just saying how paul said it that's
[49:27] foolishness
[49:29] we're to compare ourselves with the word
[49:31] what is the word speaking
[49:32] to you what is the word speaking to me
[49:37] so when we see this here him being
[49:39] represented in our life
[49:41] is what is the greatest miracle what's
[49:43] the greatest event that can take place
[49:45] in our life
[49:46] is the new birth it's to where now it's
[49:49] no longer i
[49:50] that liveth but christ that liveth in me
[49:54] it's him being represented he's
[49:56] reproducing himself
[49:58] again in his the womb of the bride
[50:04] oh he says did you get that our desire
[50:08] is not to be glorified our desire
[50:12] no one jesus listen this our desire is
[50:14] not some big name
[50:16] our desire is not boost some church or
[50:20] make more in the sunday school or try to
[50:22] bring in
[50:23] hog tie push in offer a picnic party
[50:27] or bring stars buttons or something like
[50:29] else like that
[50:30] that's not our desire our desire is to
[50:34] see
[50:35] him glorified glorified what
[50:39] not with self-pride but in us
[50:42] our lives to prove he is alive
[50:45] and living in us
[50:49] brother branham has just spoke here in
[50:51] this thing here
[50:52] and he's dealing with as in this
[50:55] particular
[50:56] part of the quote i just read the the
[50:58] avenues
[50:59] even an avenue let me just say it like
[51:01] this having a fellowship dinner
[51:04] what's the motive what's the motive with
[51:07] sisters getting together in a tea party
[51:10] see to not have a balance within this
[51:13] you read it the wrong way
[51:16] the objective is for souls
[51:19] it in the t being drunk that's gonna win
[51:21] somebody's heart
[51:22] but the christ in your life can reach
[51:25] out to somebody
[51:26] they may never tread these grounds but
[51:29] christ
[51:29] inside of your life can reach them and
[51:32] touch them
[51:33] and your life will give them an
[51:35] invitation to say
[51:36] come and see that the lord is good
[51:40] this is why paul said so many times
[51:43] these things are
[51:44] missed the simplicity of it
[51:48] i think of how you know i don't mean to
[51:50] use this example because
[51:52] i i've followed this myself many times
[51:54] but i think about
[51:56] you've heard the testimony with brother
[51:58] jerry and brother tim horner down there
[52:00] in tennessee brother tim i just said
[52:03] playing a flat flat-faced
[52:04] he was preacher burnt he had already
[52:07] seen enough
[52:08] enough preachers he didn't need no other
[52:10] preacher to come to him
[52:12] what he needed was god with skin on it
[52:16] brother jesus showed up at the table you
[52:18] know the story he didn't
[52:20] he didn't give him one scripture he
[52:21] didn't give him one quote there's a time
[52:23] when you need to be the quotes
[52:25] and you need to be the scriptures come
[52:27] on somebody
[52:28] he spoke about rottweilers the whole
[52:30] time you look in brother jerry's dog pen
[52:33] now he don't have a single rottweiler
[52:35] hadn't had one for years i got to
[52:38] thinking about that i thought lord
[52:39] if it was just for that one soul that
[52:42] you allowed him
[52:43] to know enough about that that he could
[52:45] talk to that man
[52:46] and it wasn't rottweilers brother tim
[52:48] didn't walk away from there
[52:49] being more knowledgeable about
[52:51] rottweilers he said there's something
[52:53] different about this man next day was in
[52:57] church
[52:58] by the end of the service he was there
[53:00] he surrendered his heart to god
[53:02] it wasn't the rottweiler that brought
[53:03] him to the altar
[53:06] it was jesus christ that reached out to
[53:09] his life
[53:11] you see if it had been self-pride to say
[53:13] well i've got to give scriptures
[53:15] i've got to go straight in the mouth i
[53:16] got that's self-pride
[53:19] come on somebody it's a time to be the
[53:21] word
[53:22] don't be nothing that you're not
[53:24] [Music]
[53:26] this is why paul could say i though i be
[53:29] free from all men you know what paul
[53:31] said here in the scripture
[53:32] i don't have to i don't have to become
[53:34] weak as they that are weak
[53:36] i don't have to come under the law as
[53:38] day that's under the law but paul said i
[53:40] have
[53:41] done this that i might
[53:44] win them preach somebody he want paul
[53:47] one talking about a compromise
[53:50] he said this i do for the gospel sake
[53:53] that i might be
[53:54] partaker thereof with you let me tell
[53:57] you when it's all said and done and you
[53:58] follow the leading of the lord
[54:00] it's god who gets the glory
[54:04] amen
[54:07] brothers you're in here but i can
[54:08] guarantee you just from knowing in my
[54:10] own self
[54:11] if you were to ask him and say was there
[54:13] a little bit of part about you
[54:15] should i give a scripture now or should
[54:16] i give a quote well sure
[54:18] always sensitive and always open waiting
[54:20] always ready at an appointed time
[54:22] to give something but you see it wasn't
[54:25] what god was going to use in that tool
[54:27] as far as it being spoken here it was
[54:30] what was going to be spoke
[54:31] out from here that would have the effect
[54:35] and prepare and make brother tim ready
[54:37] that was god's grace
[54:39] there was god's grace to what brother
[54:41] jerry could have sat there and glorified
[54:42] all of his understanding his knowledge
[54:44] of the message and man laid it all out
[54:46] and
[54:46] by the time that he wake up brother tim
[54:48] wake up brother tim hear this other part
[54:50] that god has showed me brother tim
[54:52] wake up brother jim he could have done
[54:53] all that that would not have been to the
[54:55] glory of god
[54:56] that would have been glorification of
[54:58] jerry browning
[55:02] bohemian even here and i'm preaching on
[55:03] him tonight but you understand what i'm
[55:05] saying
[55:06] people don't want to know how much you
[55:07] know about the word they want to see the
[55:10] word in you
[55:13] this message never come to make a
[55:15] smarter sharper
[55:16] sharper better debaters and how to take
[55:19] positions that's not what the message
[55:21] come to do
[55:21] the message come that the word might
[55:24] live in the people
[55:26] and that jesus christ might be glorified
[55:30] hallelujah glory be to god
[55:35] hallelujah oh yeah
[55:40] glory be to god in the highest movie i i
[55:42] i can never more testimony but i just
[55:44] got to keep on preaching
[55:45] you see these are things that sometimes
[55:48] this is why we need the balance
[55:50] of the holy spirit coming through the
[55:51] word
[55:54] because we've got a purpose we've got a
[55:56] reason
[55:57] amen we know what that god is in charge
[56:00] now look how brother man makes this
[56:01] statement here
[56:02] uh familiar statement with us throughout
[56:04] the message he said
[56:05] if i can get myself out of the way same
[56:07] quote is the rising of the sun
[56:09] sinkhole if i can get myself out of the
[56:11] way
[56:12] so when william branham not even thought
[56:15] of
[56:16] and you not thought of now notice if i
[56:17] can get myself out of the way
[56:19] this is up this right here is up to
[56:21] william branham
[56:23] this statement here is up to samuel
[56:25] brown this statement here
[56:27] is up to brian hanna it ain't to nobody
[56:29] else oh god you come and get me out of
[56:31] the way
[56:33] no the lord says you get yourself out of
[56:36] the way
[56:37] you yield to me well what brings us
[56:39] about
[56:40] love faith
[56:44] to trust him amen hey if you can see
[56:47] everything you got the p's and q's and i
[56:49] know foreshadow the doubt
[56:50] it's this much effective and this and
[56:52] that they trust
[56:54] but trust is that lord i don't see don't
[56:57] know how
[56:58] i don't understand but i trust you
[57:01] your word see him that's our desire
[57:05] gives us the quickening power and it
[57:08] gives us
[57:08] joy to know that we are with him both
[57:12] flesh and bone of him being the bride of
[57:15] him
[57:16] and seeing his same vindicated methods
[57:19] proving in us that he is now risen from
[57:23] the dead now in reality when when we
[57:26] read that part
[57:27] of the quote brother branham makes that
[57:28] statement many many
[57:30] places in the message perfect perfect
[57:33] strength
[57:34] through perfect weakness it takes a
[57:35] whole a whole service
[57:37] on this we can be very honest right here
[57:41] in this in the part of it that of the
[57:43] quote where it says if i can get myself
[57:44] out of the way in this portion of the
[57:47] quote above
[57:49] i'll just say it like this we
[57:52] theoretically believe it
[57:56] yet when faced with opposition or an
[58:00] otherwise negative experience we are
[58:02] quick to side
[58:03] with myself
[58:06] come on even though yourself is your
[58:08] biggest enemy
[58:11] you pampered that fella or that gal you
[58:13] know
[58:16] has you know and we pampered in a way
[58:18] huh
[58:19] my yeah if i can get myself out of the
[58:20] way and then an experience or something
[58:22] comes
[58:23] and naturally our thoughts
[58:26] our opinions well that's the revelation
[58:28] of jesus christ in the matter
[58:30] i mean everybody should see that we're
[58:33] the ones that's right
[58:35] everybody else is wrong
[58:41] but yet the reality of it is we need to
[58:43] be very honest
[58:45] and say lord help me there's some
[58:48] overcoming that needs to take place
[58:49] right
[58:50] here and lord jesus i believe that
[58:52] greater is he that's in me than he
[58:53] that's in the world
[58:54] i need your help lord help me to die
[58:58] to my thinking my feelings my thoughts
[59:00] in
[59:01] this situation that you can be glorified
[59:06] you see david would pick this up in
[59:08] psalms 44.
[59:09] he said we have heard with our ears oh
[59:11] god our fathers have told us
[59:13] what worked thou didst in their days in
[59:15] the times of old
[59:16] how thou didst drive out the heathen
[59:18] with thy hand and plantest them
[59:20] how thou didst afflict the people and
[59:23] cast them out
[59:24] for they got not the land in possession
[59:27] by their own sword
[59:28] neither did their own arm save them but
[59:31] thy right hand
[59:32] and thine arm and the light of thy
[59:34] countenance because thou
[59:36] hadest of favor unto them
[59:40] amen how many want the favor of god amen
[59:43] the favor of god his presence moving by
[59:45] his
[59:46] word to bring us into that place it's a
[59:48] place
[59:49] of his favor notice david goes on i love
[59:53] this
[59:53] thou art my king oh god command
[59:57] deliverances for jacob you know as you
[59:59] read this in a psalm probably as bible
[1:00:00] readers
[1:00:01] many of you have already seen this
[1:00:02] before but it's things that just as
[1:00:04] astounded me
[1:00:05] when you look at it you never find this
[1:00:07] kind of a statement
[1:00:08] out of saul one time saul never is
[1:00:12] recorded
[1:00:12] thou o lord are my king nope saul says
[1:00:16] i'm king i'm king
[1:00:20] he never ever places himself
[1:00:23] that i'm the king under this game come
[1:00:28] on now
[1:00:29] see he never is willing to put himself
[1:00:31] in order
[1:00:32] oh glory be to god this is why we need
[1:00:35] the help of the holy spirit
[1:00:37] that we might be in position and in
[1:00:39] divine order
[1:00:40] because when we're not in divine order
[1:00:42] then divine cannot operate the way it
[1:00:45] ought to be but everything must operate
[1:00:48] in the divine order
[1:00:49] that god has set forth this is why
[1:00:51] brother iran would take in the greatest
[1:00:52] bout of fought and he talks about the
[1:00:54] planets the stars and every one of them
[1:00:56] in their position now you realize
[1:00:57] that the jupiter cannot tell saturn get
[1:01:00] back in position
[1:01:01] there's not one of them can speak to the
[1:01:02] other but what they have to do is
[1:01:04] maintain
[1:01:05] their position because if one of them
[1:01:07] gets out of position
[1:01:08] it'll mess up the whole thing oh i'm
[1:01:11] grateful to god
[1:01:12] that the same god who put them in
[1:01:13] position who put the stars there
[1:01:15] you know that job wrote read that same
[1:01:18] bible out there that's in the sky
[1:01:19] tonight
[1:01:20] of god wrote his first bible in the
[1:01:22] heavens job wrote that same bible
[1:01:24] and god hadn't changed one speck of it
[1:01:27] he looked at the same
[1:01:28] same things the maserath orion and all
[1:01:30] the rest of them and god hadn't changed
[1:01:32] it one bit
[1:01:33] it's still the same it's there in its
[1:01:35] position
[1:01:36] it has provided and served many down
[1:01:39] through time
[1:01:40] how much more has god provided for us
[1:01:43] and provided for his children
[1:01:46] in this hour may god help us to stay in
[1:01:49] position
[1:01:50] may god help us to recognize you see
[1:01:52] position and order
[1:01:53] is not just a state of being it's also
[1:01:56] that of our heart
[1:01:58] our heart must remain in the right place
[1:02:02] this is why the spirit of god would deal
[1:02:04] with many different things within our
[1:02:05] life
[1:02:06] because sometimes our heart our feelings
[1:02:08] this is what we're talking about
[1:02:09] vaunteth not itself when things get out
[1:02:12] of position
[1:02:12] they get out of order they get out of
[1:02:14] line but the love of god is there
[1:02:17] to to bring direction and correction to
[1:02:19] our life
[1:02:20] that it might come back in line that the
[1:02:22] divine one
[1:02:24] almighty god might operate through his
[1:02:26] order
[1:02:29] notice thou are my king o god command
[1:02:31] deliverance is for jacob
[1:02:32] through thee will we push down our
[1:02:35] enemies
[1:02:36] through thy name we will tread them
[1:02:38] under that rise up against us
[1:02:40] for i will not trust in my bow neither
[1:02:43] shall my sword
[1:02:45] save me but thou has saved us from our
[1:02:48] enemies
[1:02:48] and has put them to shame that hated us
[1:02:51] in god we boast all the day long
[1:02:55] and praise thy name forever
[1:02:59] hallelujah this is the kind of boasting
[1:03:02] we want we don't want vaunting
[1:03:04] vaunting that is empty glory we want
[1:03:07] that boast that is
[1:03:08] true it's filled with substance and
[1:03:11] reality
[1:03:12] and notice this word both that's used
[1:03:14] here in the scripture
[1:03:15] it is deals with it's a word that means
[1:03:18] to be to shine
[1:03:19] and to be praiseworthy or to flash
[1:03:23] forth light david would write in this
[1:03:25] manner the lord
[1:03:27] is my light and my salvation whom shall
[1:03:29] i fear
[1:03:30] the lord is the strength of my life of
[1:03:33] whom
[1:03:33] shall i be afraid you see
[1:03:36] then the scripture would declare to us
[1:03:38] familiar scripture with you and i
[1:03:40] of the time that we're living in where
[1:03:42] the darkness is
[1:03:44] upon the world darkness is that of of a
[1:03:47] rejection of
[1:03:48] light of that of life of the word now
[1:03:51] darkness
[1:03:52] has come upon the people a gross
[1:03:54] darkness but the lord
[1:03:55] it has risen upon thee where
[1:03:59] he was held down where the veil had
[1:04:01] closed him out of
[1:04:02] man's traditions but now has the lord
[1:04:05] himself
[1:04:06] risen upon thee he declaring himself
[1:04:10] in his same power as same glory
[1:04:14] and the bible says while darkness is
[1:04:16] seen upon the people
[1:04:18] how is that darkness showing up on the
[1:04:19] people that they don't
[1:04:21] even know what they're doing
[1:04:24] it's evil spirits that's at work
[1:04:29] evil spirits that's crying out to
[1:04:31] justify
[1:04:32] sin it's evil spirits that's throughout
[1:04:37] but the scripture said in this time the
[1:04:40] glory
[1:04:41] of the lord shall be seen upon thee
[1:04:50] that ain't just about us because there's
[1:04:52] others that are out
[1:04:54] there in that darkness they need to see
[1:04:56] that light
[1:04:58] they need to see a light like a beacon
[1:05:01] house that stands in the midst when
[1:05:03] everything else
[1:05:04] is chaotic and the gross darkness is all
[1:05:06] around but there is a light
[1:05:08] that there is illuminated your life it's
[1:05:11] not
[1:05:11] darkness you've not been filled with the
[1:05:13] creeds of man
[1:05:15] and dogmas it's not darkness it's the
[1:05:17] light of his presence of his
[1:05:19] life that illuminates your life to where
[1:05:22] when it's said and done
[1:05:23] they may not know what denomination or
[1:05:25] where do you belong or where it is but
[1:05:27] there's one thing about it
[1:05:28] they know that's a christian you got to
[1:05:30] pray request for prayer
[1:05:32] take it to them in prayer they'll take
[1:05:34] it and pray over it because they got
[1:05:36] confidence in the light of life that's
[1:05:38] in you
[1:05:42] glory this is why jesus said in matthew
[1:05:44] 5
[1:05:45] 16 let your light so shine before me
[1:05:49] this is boasting all the day long
[1:05:51] let your light so shine before men
[1:05:54] that they may see your good works
[1:05:58] and we're not just talking about we're
[1:05:59] not talking about going over and getting
[1:06:00] a you know fruit basket for the poor
[1:06:03] we're talking about good works good
[1:06:05] works that are
[1:06:06] already packed within the seed every
[1:06:09] leaf
[1:06:09] every fruit we've been ordained unto
[1:06:12] good works
[1:06:13] this isn't working ourselves in it's the
[1:06:15] expression
[1:06:17] where the quickening power has come into
[1:06:19] that seed into that word what's it doing
[1:06:21] it's expressing the word these are the
[1:06:25] good words that they might see
[1:06:27] the good works hallelujah and do what
[1:06:31] glorify your father which is in heaven
[1:06:33] let me just say this to you you read
[1:06:35] through the gospel
[1:06:36] and there was healing taking place there
[1:06:38] was things the bible says over and over
[1:06:40] when as they saw the healings take place
[1:06:43] they witnessed and they
[1:06:44] they seen as he was there among them the
[1:06:46] bible says
[1:06:47] they glorified god for this visitation
[1:06:51] they glorified god they knew that it was
[1:06:54] god among them a man can't do this
[1:06:59] they glorified god over and over in the
[1:07:01] scripture
[1:07:02] how much more that a people could be
[1:07:04] able to look oh god let it be
[1:07:07] they could look in our life and listen
[1:07:09] while the rest of the world is falling
[1:07:11] and collapsing listen that flash is no
[1:07:13] different than your flesh
[1:07:15] but what's the difference god on the
[1:07:17] inside
[1:07:18] amen god has chosen you god's anointed
[1:07:22] you as an overcomer
[1:07:23] it's not you that liveth it's not you
[1:07:26] per se by yourself
[1:07:27] that's overcoming it's an overcoming one
[1:07:29] within you
[1:07:30] that's made you an overcomer
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:36] hallelujah it's a voice that speaks from
[1:07:40] you hallelujah it's not a voice that
[1:07:43] calls people to a tabernacle that's been
[1:07:47] erected
[1:07:47] it's a voice that declares hear ye him
[1:07:51] the word hallelujah
[1:07:54] it declares the word has liberty within
[1:07:57] it
[1:07:57] this is what peter could say in first
[1:08:00] peter chapter 2 verse 9
[1:08:01] ye are a chosen generation a royal
[1:08:04] priesthood
[1:08:05] a holy nation of peculiar people that
[1:08:08] you should
[1:08:09] show forth the praises of him who
[1:08:12] called you out of darkness into his
[1:08:14] marvelous light
[1:08:16] we're not walking by the lights of the
[1:08:18] heaven
[1:08:19] we are not walking by the light of the
[1:08:22] candlesticks
[1:08:23] but we are walking by the shekinah light
[1:08:26] this is a light that cannot go out in
[1:08:29] your spirit
[1:08:30] your spirit sometimes can get weak it
[1:08:32] can go out
[1:08:33] your body can get down under atmospheres
[1:08:36] and things
[1:08:36] but there's a light that is inside of
[1:08:38] you that we read about here that david
[1:08:41] said in psalms 27
[1:08:42] isaiah 60 it is the lord that is the
[1:08:45] light
[1:08:45] of your life that even when your spirit
[1:08:48] wanes
[1:08:49] or your mind or anything but there is a
[1:08:51] god
[1:08:52] on the inside there's a light that's
[1:08:54] present there
[1:08:55] to lead you when it seems so dark around
[1:08:58] you
[1:08:58] there's a light of one who is present
[1:09:01] who said
[1:09:02] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:09:04] the shadow of death
[1:09:05] i will feel no evil why david for
[1:09:08] thou art with me
[1:09:17] to show forth praises to him now this
[1:09:19] isn't just a sin glory to god
[1:09:21] hallelujah it's praises of our life
[1:09:24] our conduct not just in the good times
[1:09:28] but it's in those times that are are
[1:09:30] tough
[1:09:32] it's in the times that can be rather
[1:09:34] hard
[1:09:35] the times as we said that can be so
[1:09:37] disagreeable
[1:09:39] our flesh would want to go in a certain
[1:09:40] direction but the soul says
[1:09:45] if you do that that's about you
[1:09:50] now we might as well be honest the times
[1:09:53] because we all could say this and go
[1:09:54] through it
[1:09:55] there's been times where we have we have
[1:09:57] went according to the flesh
[1:09:59] and you reap for it and then there's
[1:10:02] times
[1:10:03] thanks be to god where there's been a
[1:10:05] prevailing and an overcoming
[1:10:06] and that soul has stepped forward to the
[1:10:08] front and as soon as
[1:10:09] soon as you let go you know how it is
[1:10:11] you just feel like
[1:10:13] yes the battle is already done and you
[1:10:16] ain't even went to calvary are you with
[1:10:17] me now
[1:10:18] you you just had your gethsemane
[1:10:20] wrestling
[1:10:22] as brother branham recorded hebrews 5 7
[1:10:24] contending
[1:10:26] with himself
[1:10:30] glory be to god oh blessed be his name
[1:10:36] which in times past were not a people
[1:10:39] you were just we were just scattered
[1:10:40] here and there
[1:10:42] we might have been sitting right in the
[1:10:43] messy church but we still were scattered
[1:10:44] it wasn't
[1:10:46] we didn't have any identity
[1:10:49] in times past we're not of people but
[1:10:51] are now the people of god
[1:10:52] which had not obtained mercy but now
[1:10:55] have obtained mercy we lacked identity
[1:11:00] even value about our life we couldn't
[1:11:02] even see i i don't understand
[1:11:04] i don't see what the words about i don't
[1:11:05] understand at all i don't do that
[1:11:07] this and that and then god starts
[1:11:10] dealing with your life
[1:11:12] right then things you start looking at
[1:11:14] things differently
[1:11:16] what's happening it's the same story
[1:11:18] brother branham used
[1:11:20] where a violin nobody was willing to
[1:11:22] give a penny for it
[1:11:25] but the master lori
[1:11:28] who knew how to play that life
[1:11:33] he walked up and he took your life
[1:11:37] he took my life everybody said
[1:11:41] wouldn't give you a penny for him ain't
[1:11:44] worth nothing
[1:11:46] but he came forward he took us in his
[1:11:50] hands he picked us up
[1:11:52] and he put us right underneath his chin
[1:11:57] he began to take that bow of
[1:12:00] predestinated grace
[1:12:02] and he began to run it over our life now
[1:12:06] our life had to be tuned up a little bit
[1:12:09] but he know how to tune it
[1:12:12] her life was so out of tune with the
[1:12:14] word it didn't matter how much that we
[1:12:16] had set
[1:12:16] in a message church might have known all
[1:12:18] the quotes but we needed to be
[1:12:21] tuned by the hand of the master and he
[1:12:24] picked us up
[1:12:25] and he started playing and tuning and
[1:12:27] fine tuning in our life
[1:12:28] when he got finished as brother branham
[1:12:32] would dramatize it he said there wasn't
[1:12:34] a dry
[1:12:35] eye glory in that auction
[1:12:40] you took a violin that nobody would bid
[1:12:43] on
[1:12:44] but in the hand of the master it became
[1:12:48] priceless or a bit of god
[1:12:52] hallelujah there's one who knew how to
[1:12:55] bring out of that violin
[1:12:56] the music that was trapped in it can i
[1:13:00] preach for a minute
[1:13:01] there's one who knew how to bring the
[1:13:03] music
[1:13:04] out of your life he knew exactly how to
[1:13:07] do it it was trapped in there
[1:13:10] but god's got a victrola needle
[1:13:15] there was worm to be expressed trapped
[1:13:18] in your life
[1:13:20] and god knew how to bring it out of your
[1:13:23] life
[1:13:24] getting in his presence he took your
[1:13:27] life in his hands
[1:13:29] and he began to bring out what was
[1:13:31] canned up
[1:13:32] in your life you were wanting to let out
[1:13:36] and he himself gave you liberty
[1:13:39] to release what was on the inside of you

[1:13:59] do all things without murmurings and
[1:14:02] disputings

[1:14:06] care of a lot of facebook posts wouldn't
[1:14:08] it
[1:14:12] that ye may be blameless
[1:14:15] and harmless the sons of god
[1:14:18] without rebuke
[1:14:22] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[1:14:26] nation lord have mercy if we're not
[1:14:28] there we've arrived
[1:14:32] among whom among whom
[1:14:36] ye shine as lights in the world
[1:14:42] don't let your light be clouded
[1:14:46] do all things without murmurings and
[1:14:49] disputings do you recognize what that
[1:14:51] says
[1:14:51] there are some things that you can have
[1:14:52] murmurings and grumblings over i don't
[1:14:54] like this and
[1:14:55] i wish this wasn't and i listen and we
[1:14:57] can have disputing so i'll tell you what
[1:14:59] this and that you might have and we all
[1:15:01] have maybe our own feelings our own
[1:15:03] opinions on certain things
[1:15:04] maybe your opinions are the gospel on it
[1:15:07] but for the reality and for the sake
[1:15:09] of the light of god that rest in your
[1:15:11] bosom do not let
[1:15:13] murmurings and disputings bring a
[1:15:16] reproach
[1:15:17] or a darkening to the light
[1:15:22] among whom ye shine as lights in the
[1:15:25] world
[1:15:26] holding forth holding fast the word of
[1:15:28] life that i may rejoice in the day of
[1:15:30] christ
[1:15:30] that i have not run in vain neither
[1:15:32] labored in vain
[1:15:34] notice what jesus said let me try to
[1:15:38] work here on this part jesus as he is an
[1:15:42] intercessory prayer this is after the
[1:15:43] supper
[1:15:46] now they've come they've come apart
[1:15:47] they're in the garden
[1:15:50] and here is the intercession that he
[1:15:53] would make i have
[1:15:54] glorified thee on earth i have finished
[1:15:58] the work which thou gavest
[1:16:01] me to do
[1:16:05] now remember the son could do nothing
[1:16:07] but what he seeth the father doing
[1:16:09] but you see now as god would reveal to
[1:16:12] him
[1:16:13] this what's to be done here this step
[1:16:16] this stage of the journey
[1:16:18] this part that he was at it was all god
[1:16:20] working
[1:16:22] that indeed the fulfillment of the word
[1:16:24] the purpose
[1:16:25] that he was sent for might come
[1:16:29] to completion and this is the testimony
[1:16:32] that the lord jesus could give in prayer
[1:16:36] i have glorified thee on earth i tell
[1:16:38] you what
[1:16:39] a prayer this is what my desire is that
[1:16:42] we could say of an evening when we're
[1:16:44] in devotion lord i'll glorify thee this
[1:16:47] day
[1:16:48] not bragging it's not us bonting but
[1:16:50] lord i've glorified me this day
[1:16:52] and maybe if the rest of the family
[1:16:54] could see it there might have been
[1:16:55] people that's run you down
[1:16:56] people that said all sorts of things
[1:16:58] against you people that's crossed you
[1:17:00] you know they pushed your buttons
[1:17:02] your holy buttons you know and yet here
[1:17:04] you have been able to say
[1:17:06] god by your grace i've glorified thee
[1:17:09] today
[1:17:10] you have lord jesus by your grace i've
[1:17:13] conducted myself
[1:17:15] as a son and daughter of god lord it
[1:17:17] wasn't something that was
[1:17:19] that was easy as far as on my part but i
[1:17:21] want to thank you for divine assistance
[1:17:24] thank you for strength amen
[1:17:28] hey we ought to thank him as much as
[1:17:29] many times we ask him to forgive us
[1:17:33] is that right now let's just look at
[1:17:35] this here just just a moment remember i
[1:17:37] read this to you last week
[1:17:38] remember how paul would write and he
[1:17:40] would remind the people of god
[1:17:42] that no flesh should glory in the
[1:17:44] presence
[1:17:45] of god paul would write how that what
[1:17:48] god has chosen
[1:17:50] god chose things that are deemed foolish
[1:17:54] things that were deemed weak things that
[1:17:57] were deemed
[1:17:58] base base means insignificant
[1:18:01] things that are not or nothing
[1:18:05] to bring to nothing the things that are
[1:18:09] this is god's choosing now god could
[1:18:11] have chose many mighty people he could
[1:18:13] have chose
[1:18:13] all that now paul didn't say he didn't
[1:18:15] choose son
[1:18:17] but he's letting us see that the
[1:18:19] choosing of god
[1:18:20] you see even with us that would be weak
[1:18:22] and base and everything else that we can
[1:18:25] look at
[1:18:26] god has his hands full with us
[1:18:29] in us being able to stay in a place of
[1:18:32] humility
[1:18:33] it isn't that we want to bond ourselves
[1:18:35] it isn't that we want the glory
[1:18:37] but god knows even in ourselves our
[1:18:39] desire and just as he gave paul
[1:18:41] divine assistance god gives you and i
[1:18:44] divine assistance
[1:18:45] that he might be able to use us god
[1:18:48] never wants us to feel like
[1:18:49] it's us or get to a place where it's so
[1:18:52] big that
[1:18:52] you know everything's going so good
[1:18:54] maybe i don't need to pray as much as i
[1:18:55] used to maybe i don't need to
[1:18:56] listen to messages much i look maybe i
[1:18:58] don't need to read as much you know
[1:19:00] everything just going so good
[1:19:02] [Music]

[1:20:04] young people over and i'll tell you
[1:20:06] especially at our other house my
[1:20:07] goodness there'd be mosquitoes buzzing
[1:20:09] around all over the place and we had
[1:20:10] them you know them tiki lamps
[1:20:12] lined profits they didn't scare away
[1:20:14] none of them mosquitoes at all
[1:20:16] but i'll tell you as soon as they
[1:20:17] started building that fire up and things
[1:20:18] like that and
[1:20:19] josh would help us you know doing that
[1:20:21] and brian and there they would get that
[1:20:22] fire going we knew as soon as you get
[1:20:24] that fire going
[1:20:25] the smoke from that fire we didn't have
[1:20:27] to worry about the mosquitoes very much
[1:20:28] anymore
[1:20:29] you know what it didn't mean that the
[1:20:30] mosquitoes weren't out there they were
[1:20:32] still there
[1:20:33] but you know what they could buzz all
[1:20:34] they wanted to out there
[1:20:36] but we were fixing hot dogs in here
[1:20:38] having marshmallows right here i think
[1:20:39] i'll take another bowl that chili
[1:20:41] i think i'll take some more chips i
[1:20:43] think i'll take some more of this what
[1:20:44] was doing that
[1:20:45] the fire gave us liberty to enjoy
[1:20:48] ourselves
[1:20:51] hallelujah and feeding the fire in your
[1:20:55] life
[1:20:55] will enjoy you will allow you to enjoy
[1:20:58] the liberty of the lord
[1:21:00] in the midst of darkness in the midst of
[1:21:03] darkness
[1:21:10] hallelujah you see
[1:21:14] let me just bring it down into this
[1:21:17] the baggage many times that we enter
[1:21:19] into
[1:21:21] this life we bring you know brother
[1:21:23] brown would talk about it like a grab
[1:21:25] bag
[1:21:26] things that you and i come in with and
[1:21:29] we inherit we didn't ask
[1:21:32] there's other experiences in our life
[1:21:33] that we experienced
[1:21:35] we didn't ask to experience and you see
[1:21:38] these are things that really they work
[1:21:41] for
[1:21:42] to our molding to our shaping of our
[1:21:44] character
[1:21:46] our thinking our mindset in many
[1:21:48] situations oftentimes
[1:21:50] it's because of those things that we
[1:21:53] respond
[1:21:54] the way we respond are you with me
[1:21:58] now you you can say brother samuel
[1:22:01] i've been born again of the spirit of
[1:22:02] god but remember
[1:22:04] let your light shine let this mind be
[1:22:07] in you that was also in christ jesus
[1:22:11] we go on and on as paul would deal with
[1:22:13] things through ephesians through
[1:22:15] colossians and even into galatians
[1:22:17] dealing with the saints of god to let
[1:22:19] that new man have the right of way
[1:22:21] in your life is that right
[1:22:24] so now this is why
[1:22:28] because our character we know that our
[1:22:30] character is molded by the life that we
[1:22:32] have in us
[1:22:33] this is why we must be born again we've
[1:22:35] got to receive the life of the father
[1:22:37] within us
[1:22:39] sometimes our upbringing and experiences
[1:22:41] they can shape the way when we view
[1:22:42] others or happenings
[1:22:45] it can still affect us this is why
[1:22:49] i want you just to listen to this this
[1:22:50] is why it's just inspiration the lord
[1:22:52] just
[1:22:53] moving on my heart this is why let this
[1:22:55] mind be in you that was in christ jesus
[1:22:58] who thought it not robbery or rather a
[1:23:01] thing to be
[1:23:02] grasped after to be equal with god in
[1:23:05] other words he was not
[1:23:07] it was not something that he felt
[1:23:09] compelled to prove
[1:23:10] that he was the son of god
[1:23:14] but rather he relied upon what the
[1:23:16] father made him
[1:23:18] when it was time for a further
[1:23:19] fulfillment of the word
[1:23:21] he being in tune with his father that
[1:23:23] was in him in humility
[1:23:26] would ask the father glorify thou me
[1:23:29] with the glory that i had with thee
[1:23:33] before the world began see he knew
[1:23:36] what god had made he knew where he was
[1:23:39] tied into
[1:23:40] glorify thou me with the glory
[1:23:43] that i had with thee
[1:23:46] before the world begins now god was
[1:23:50] already
[1:23:51] being glorified in the sun
[1:23:54] he was already being glorified the glory
[1:23:57] of god
[1:23:58] was already being made manifest in his
[1:24:00] life but it
[1:24:01] shows there was a further glory
[1:24:05] that was needed in order to fulfill
[1:24:10] that portion that was left to be
[1:24:12] fulfilled
[1:24:13] in his life and he asked
[1:24:17] glorified thou me with that glory
[1:24:21] that i had before the world began
[1:24:24] hallelujah
[1:24:25] certainly not how the world would think
[1:24:26] about it
[1:24:28] the world would look at that like shock
[1:24:29] and awe i thought
[1:24:31] no no
[1:24:34] the simple humble
[1:24:38] work that would be done in such
[1:24:42] simplicity
[1:24:44] but through that would release the glory
[1:24:47] of god
[1:24:48] into the hearts of others
[1:24:52] think of this his purpose achievement of
[1:24:56] the lord working in that life of the
[1:24:57] lord jesus
[1:24:58] as our kinsmen redeemer think of when he
[1:25:01] stood there in pilate's judgment hall
[1:25:02] he declared for this purpose came i into
[1:25:05] the world
[1:25:07] by worldly standards the world would
[1:25:09] have said
[1:25:10] oh really a purpose to die
[1:25:16] don't you know i could crucify you don't
[1:25:18] you know right
[1:25:20] thou could just have no power
[1:25:23] over me that's right come on this is
[1:25:25] where the bride is standing
[1:25:27] accept it be given thee
[1:25:31] see the bride know where she's standing
[1:25:34] no power it could not be given you
[1:25:36] except it be given
[1:25:38] of my fault he knew his life was
[1:25:41] in the hands of the father
[1:25:45] are you talking about good hands brother
[1:25:48] this is blessed assurance
[1:25:53] hallelujah he was purposed for
[1:25:55] redemption
[1:25:56] and it would take listen to me now it
[1:25:59] would take the glory of god
[1:26:01] the capping of his purpose in humility
[1:26:05] to go to california think of that
[1:26:08] the capping of the promise came
[1:26:11] with the greatest submission and request
[1:26:15] for the father to glorify thou me
[1:26:19] with thyself
[1:26:23] it was not any selfish motives or
[1:26:25] objectives but rather the glory of god
[1:26:27] the unfolding of the presence of god
[1:26:29] that is allotted in the word
[1:26:32] the divine energy in order for the word
[1:26:34] to be fulfilled
[1:26:36] through simplicity in a yielded vessel
[1:26:39] for he was led as a lamb
[1:26:43] led to the slaughter you see what the
[1:26:47] glory of god did that he was asking for
[1:26:49] glorify thou me with the glory
[1:26:52] i had with thee before the world began
[1:26:54] this is what that glory did
[1:26:57] it brought the greatest submission
[1:27:00] of one who was able to fulfill
[1:27:04] what was echoed even on
[1:27:08] matthew 17 mount transfiguration
[1:27:11] you know this brought this glory don't
[1:27:13] you see
[1:27:14] the glory of god being revealed and
[1:27:17] moving in our life what does it do
[1:27:19] it brings submission it brings yielding
[1:27:24] it brings us giving in which allows god
[1:27:28] to step in
[1:27:31] jesus said like this i'm closing
[1:27:36] when he would say in john 17 and i don't
[1:27:39] have time to read all that i want to go
[1:27:41] to another scripture after this and then
[1:27:43] we'll just
[1:27:44] close jesus said
[1:27:48] now is the hour that the son of man
[1:27:52] is to be glorified
[1:27:57] and he makes a statement that you and i
[1:27:59] are familiar with
[1:28:01] except a corn of wheat fall
[1:28:04] in the ground and
[1:28:07] die it abideth alone how many know he
[1:28:14] said
[1:28:15] it ain't good for man to be alone
[1:28:23] but except he'd fall in the ground and
[1:28:25] die he'd abide us
[1:28:27] alone but
[1:28:30] if it died it bringeth forth
[1:28:33] much fruit
[1:28:37] jesus goes on and he says this in john
[1:28:40] 13 we'll just try to pick these two
[1:28:43] here he stands in john 13 the chapter
[1:28:45] later verse 31
[1:28:48] when judas had left judas dipped in the
[1:28:50] salt and he left
[1:28:53] i want you to think think of what's
[1:28:54] taking place think of the setting
[1:28:57] the word has given judas
[1:29:00] believe you can go
[1:29:04] do whatever you're going to do notice do
[1:29:06] whatever
[1:29:07] thou doest do it quickly
[1:29:11] judas went out he had his
[1:29:14] selfish desire the whole time
[1:29:19] never took care of that it eventually
[1:29:21] got him
[1:29:26] this is why there's got to be a death to
[1:29:27] self yes
[1:29:29] and through that it makes way that as
[1:29:32] paul said
[1:29:33] i die daily
[1:29:37] why that he might be glorified
[1:29:40] so judas is left now
[1:29:44] jesus said is the son of man glorified
[1:29:47] and god is glorified in him
[1:29:51] if god be glorified in him god also
[1:29:54] shall also glorify him in himself
[1:29:58] and shall straightway glorify him
[1:30:01] so here he is god
[1:30:05] the son of man who who was ordained for
[1:30:07] this moment ordained for this position
[1:30:10] is being glorified god
[1:30:13] is being glorified in him
[1:30:16] the word itself that is spoke of this
[1:30:19] moment is being glorified
[1:30:21] the disciples don't realize it at that
[1:30:23] time
[1:30:25] but after his resurrection he begins to
[1:30:28] reveal to them
[1:30:29] the word that is glorified in their day
[1:30:33] and that word will take them into their
[1:30:36] glory
[1:30:37] are you with me
[1:30:40] what look look at this little children
[1:30:44] yet a little while i'm with you ye shall
[1:30:46] seek me
[1:30:47] and as i said unto the jews whether i go
[1:30:49] you cannot come
[1:30:50] so now i say to you a new commandment i
[1:30:54] give unto you
[1:30:55] that you love one another as i've loved
[1:30:58] you that you
[1:30:58] also love one another and by this shall
[1:31:02] all men know that you are my disciples
[1:31:04] if you have
[1:31:05] love one for another
[1:31:10] this is the son of man being glorified
[1:31:13] i wonder i wonder
[1:31:16] when we look at that portion of the word
[1:31:20] let's just close here
[1:31:23] is the reality of the god of glory being
[1:31:26] glorified
[1:31:28] in the son of man is it is it
[1:31:31] the lord jesus himself
[1:31:34] now being glorified in his fullness
[1:31:38] in the life of the bride
[1:31:42] yeah but that glory
[1:31:47] that glory is that he would have
[1:31:49] preeminence
[1:31:51] is that right i wonder if it's
[1:31:55] so surrendered say god let me be so
[1:31:58] surrendered
[1:32:01] to you that the love of god has such
[1:32:04] preeminence
[1:32:05] in every part of my life in
[1:32:08] every circumstance in every
[1:32:12] offense in every testimony
[1:32:16] may you be glorified and may lord god
[1:32:19] you be glorified
[1:32:20] and that i would be glorified not me
[1:32:22] showing up but that my
[1:32:23] actions and everything would be word
[1:32:27] based based
[1:32:31] in the word amen why because outside of
[1:32:34] the word
[1:32:35] is not glorified the only glory there is
[1:32:39] the only boasting there is is in him
[1:32:42] amen
[1:32:44] let's pray
[1:32:48] i'd say this as we get ready to pray
[1:32:52] here
[1:32:54] may the lord grant us the glorification
[1:32:58] of himself
[1:33:00] living in the closing hour in the
[1:33:01] closing moments
[1:33:04] that is the bride body
[1:33:07] here he is the mighty god unveiled
[1:33:09] before us
[1:33:11] walking living dwelling
[1:33:14] in his fullness right in the midst of
[1:33:17] the bride body
[1:33:18] we being a part of that body by god's
[1:33:21] grace may the lord grant us the
[1:33:23] glorification of himself well what is
[1:33:25] that the equipping
[1:33:28] of his strength of the divine energy of
[1:33:32] the vine
[1:33:33] moving through the branch
[1:33:36] being able to submit our own will fully
[1:33:39] to his purpose
[1:33:41] that he can fully work through us
[1:33:44] it's no wonder we need to live in his
[1:33:46] presence
[1:33:47] he's our liberty he's our all in all
[1:33:54] think of it many people they'll never
[1:33:56] read a bible
[1:33:58] but they read you they read me
[1:34:02] brother brown would say like this in one
[1:34:03] place he said you might think
[1:34:05] nobody's watching your life he said but
[1:34:08] somebody's watching your life
[1:34:11] somebody's watching your actions
[1:34:13] somebody's watching
[1:34:14] your behavior may god help it
[1:34:18] help us to be so yielded to him
[1:34:23] you know sometimes before there's ever
[1:34:25] action sometimes
[1:34:27] it'd be all you know it always begins
[1:34:28] with thoughts
[1:34:30] sometimes you can let thoughts feelings
[1:34:32] you can let things compound
[1:34:34] and accumulate
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:41] no matter what the situation no matter
[1:34:43] what the need
