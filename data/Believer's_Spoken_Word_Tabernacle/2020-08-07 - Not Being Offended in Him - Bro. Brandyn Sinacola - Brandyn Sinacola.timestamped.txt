[8:10] me
[8:23] just want to greet you on behalf of
[8:24] brother paul and the church at home
[8:27] and it's always good to be with you and
[8:30] you guys got a pretty good turnout for a
[8:32] midweek service so that's pretty good
[8:34] god bless you for it and
[8:38] just pray for me um as i was walking
[8:41] this way
[8:42] i was finishing notes up and kind of
[8:45] fell into that channel of inspiration
[8:46] today and
[8:48] i got about half of my notes done um
[8:51] just felt like the lord you know just
[8:53] took me this until this afternoon to
[8:56] really feel like i hit that channel and
[8:59] then um
[9:00] you know i'm putting stuff together and
[9:01] then it was just kind of like
[9:03] i might take you a different route
[9:05] midway so
[9:07] just pray for me and bear with me here
[9:08] but
[9:10] um you want to open with me to mark
[9:12] chapter 4.
[9:20] mark chapter 4.
[9:24] are you happy to be in the house of the
[9:26] lord
[9:35] mark 4 and verse 13.
[9:43] and he said unto them know ye not this
[9:46] parable
[9:47] and how then will ye know all parables
[9:50] the sower soweth the word and these are
[9:53] they by the wayside where the word is
[9:55] sown
[9:56] but when they have heard satan cometh
[9:58] immediately and taketh
[9:59] away the word that was sown in their
[10:02] hearts
[10:03] and these are they likewise which are
[10:05] sown on stony ground who
[10:07] when they have heard the word
[10:09] immediately receive it with gladness
[10:12] and have no root in themselves and so
[10:15] endure but for a time
[10:17] afterwards when affliction or
[10:18] persecution ariseth for the word's sake
[10:21] immediately they are offended and these
[10:24] are they which are sown among thorns
[10:26] such as hear the word
[10:28] and the cares of this world and the
[10:30] deceitfulness of riches
[10:31] and the lusts of other things entering
[10:33] in choke the word
[10:34] and it becometh unfruitful and these are
[10:37] they which are sown on good ground
[10:39] such as hear the word and receive it
[10:43] and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold
[10:45] some 60-fold
[10:46] and some 100-fold bow our hearts
[10:50] together tonight
[10:50] lord jesus we come before you god and
[10:54] lord i i'm your humble servant lord
[10:58] i can do nothing in myself but with what
[11:00] you lead me to do lord
[11:03] father this people came tonight to hear
[11:05] from you lord
[11:08] help me god to get out of the way
[11:11] i ask you to take my vocal cords lord
[11:14] open and close my mouth father
[11:17] let my thoughts in your heart lord
[11:20] your thoughts and my heart beat in
[11:22] harmony now
[11:25] speak to your people give them what they
[11:27] need father
[11:29] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[11:32] said o my spirit lord
[11:35] jesus amen
[11:39] you can have your seats
[11:43] i hope you all are doing well it almost
[11:45] feels like you know we should
[11:47] just ask you how you're doing and have a
[11:49] little time of fellowship first but
[11:52] get right into the word is this mike a
[11:54] problem brother or do i need to move
[11:56] it or anything are we okay
[11:59] okay all right just want to make sure
[12:03] so as i was praying and i was thinking
[12:05] about the service this evening
[12:08] i had two two main points come to my
[12:10] heart
[12:12] uh that i wanted to um
[12:16] sorry let me just get comfortable here
[12:19] two main points i wanted to bring to you
[12:23] tonight that came to my heart
[12:25] the first one was just about um divine
[12:28] healing it just kept seeming to
[12:30] pulsate in my heart and in my mind i
[12:33] just got
[12:34] kept having it real strong and so we're
[12:36] going to try to go into that a little
[12:37] bit and the
[12:39] the second thing is is the the hindrance
[12:41] of of being able to believe his word
[12:44] or just the fact that god's word is
[12:47] still true today
[12:49] and again just not exactly sure um
[12:53] completely of the direction i thought
[12:55] well maybe that has to do with that
[12:57] pulsating in my heart is that
[12:59] you know it's is how this relates or
[13:02] correlates with divine healing i'm not
[13:06] i'm not 100 sure standing before you i
[13:08] can't say but
[13:09] we're just going to preach and trust god
[13:11] so if you've got a question in your
[13:13] heart and i'll just say it like this
[13:15] if you pull i'll preach and i'll do my
[13:19] very best to get out of the way
[13:21] and and you get out of the way and you
[13:23] just trust god amen
[13:24] and that's that's what i'm doing here so
[13:28] i just want you to keep the scripture in
[13:29] your minds as we minister tonight in
[13:31] psalms 107 verse 20
[13:34] says he sent his word and healed them
[13:37] and delivered them from their
[13:39] destructions
[13:40] now this was profound to me because it's
[13:43] it's
[13:45] we we know that over in the book of acts
[13:48] when peter was
[13:48] ministering and and it says while peter
[13:50] yet spake these words they received the
[13:53] holy ghost
[13:54] while while peter yet spake these words
[13:56] he was they received the holy ghost so
[13:59] it was while the word was going forth so
[14:02] if you'll just take what you have need
[14:03] of tonight and you'll you'll
[14:05] you'll keep that in your heart and
[14:06] you'll keep it in your mind
[14:08] brother branham would say then then just
[14:11] just let the word minister to you your
[14:14] answer can come over the pulpit it just
[14:16] depends maybe on your expectation or
[14:18] what you're here for tonight
[14:20] really god can exceed our expectation
[14:22] you might not be expecting much tonight
[14:24] it might be that you know oh here's the
[14:26] young buck preacher visiting minister
[14:28] pastors out of town so yeah we'll relax
[14:31] a little bit
[14:32] but god even in if if your heart is
[14:34] there tonight god can
[14:35] can override that and he can speak
[14:37] directly to you
[14:40] so it's just it's just so profound
[14:42] because it's just
[14:43] as the word goes forward and really what
[14:45] it is is as i was listening on the way
[14:47] here
[14:47] brother branham was explaining and he
[14:49] said you have something deposited in you
[14:52] god put that in you before the
[14:53] foundation of the world that was in you
[14:55] and when that light comes in it and it
[14:57] strikes across your path
[14:59] that that it sparks that thing that god
[15:02] put in you
[15:03] and and your faith will come forward so
[15:06] why is it that the
[15:07] that while the word is being preached is
[15:08] because that's encouraging your faith
[15:10] it's because
[15:11] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[15:13] the word
[15:15] amen but
[15:18] if you have need of healing in your body
[15:20] tonight
[15:22] the scripture proclaims that as the word
[15:23] goes forth if you'll just believe you
[15:25] can receive your healing
[15:27] if you're seeking the holy ghost if you
[15:29] just believe you can receive the holy
[15:31] ghost while the word goes forward
[15:34] what healed them the word the word he
[15:37] sent
[15:38] and may it be again tonight like the
[15:40] roman centurion came to mind when i was
[15:42] thinking on this you know the roman
[15:44] centurion he came to christ
[15:46] and and and uh i just i just um
[15:49] i just want to go ahead and read it
[15:50] matthew 8 and verse 7.
[15:52] you don't got to turn there i'll read it
[15:54] to you and jesus said unto him i will
[15:56] come and heal him
[15:58] talking about i believe it was a son or
[16:00] a servant you forgive me
[16:02] the centurion answered and said lord i
[16:04] am not worthy that thou should has come
[16:05] under my roof but speak the word only
[16:08] and my servant shall be healed for i am
[16:10] a man under authority
[16:12] having soldiers under me and i say to
[16:14] this man go and he goeth
[16:16] and to another come and he cometh and to
[16:19] my servant do this and he doeth it
[16:21] when jesus heard it he marveled this is
[16:24] the response of jesus christ
[16:26] the god fully manifested in flesh
[16:30] and he marveled at the man's faith
[16:34] and said to them that followed verily i
[16:36] say unto you i have not found so great
[16:38] of faith
[16:39] no not in israel skip into verse 13 and
[16:41] jesus said unto the centurion
[16:43] go thy way and as thou hast believed so
[16:46] it be done unto thee and his servant was
[16:49] healed
[16:50] in the selfsame hour
[16:53] i want to proclaim to you tonight that
[16:54] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[16:57] and forever
[16:59] it doesn't matter what's happened in
[17:00] your life
[17:02] in your past what you're going through
[17:04] now it doesn't matter what will happen
[17:05] in your future
[17:06] i'm proclaiming to you tonight jesus
[17:09] christ is the same yesterday today and
[17:11] forever
[17:14] brother branham said this but the hour
[17:15] has arrived the last days are here when
[17:17] god
[17:18] promised according to malachi 4 that he
[17:20] would raise up in the last days and
[17:22] would turn the hearts of the people back
[17:23] to the original blessings
[17:25] and the pentecostal faith of the fathers
[17:27] and you can't deny it and you can't
[17:29] withstand it
[17:30] it says in another spot i call the same
[17:32] thing that peter did he called
[17:34] repentance of that generation
[17:36] i call repentance to this generation
[17:38] repentance towards god
[17:39] and come back to the original truth of
[17:41] the word come back to the faith of our
[17:43] fathers come back to the holy ghost
[17:46] because god cannot change god cannot
[17:49] change it
[17:50] when god said these signs shall follow
[17:52] them that believe
[17:53] he has to stay with that through all of
[17:56] eternity
[17:56] it's his word a little further down but
[17:59] jesus
[18:00] said this will be the identification
[18:01] these signs shall not
[18:04] shall these signs shall excuse me not
[18:07] they may be
[18:08] they will in all generations to them
[18:11] that believe
[18:12] in my name they'll cast out devils
[18:14] they'll speak with other tongues
[18:16] speak with new tongues take up serpents
[18:18] drink deadly things it won't harm them
[18:19] a little further down heal the sick
[18:21] raise the dead cast out devils as freely
[18:24] as you receive freely give
[18:27] now i want to talk to you a little bit
[18:29] just kind of change gears just
[18:30] just slightly that man has successfully
[18:35] removed absolutes today
[18:39] anything that used to be an absolute man
[18:42] has
[18:42] questioned anything that used to be an
[18:45] absolute man is working to change
[18:47] and if i if i understanding it right
[18:50] they throw the term around right now
[18:52] they call it cancel culture
[18:54] they're trying to cancel everything that
[18:56] we once knew
[18:57] and create something of their own
[18:59] imagination to fit
[19:00] what's right in their own eyes
[19:04] i i listening to ex-army ranger and he
[19:07] just he said
[19:07] he said something along these lines and
[19:09] i don't know if it's true i don't know
[19:11] where he got it from but
[19:12] it rang true speaking of history man has
[19:15] gone from
[19:16] from god uh sorry
[19:19] man has gone from god says to reason
[19:22] says to what is truth
[19:26] to you get to define what truth is
[19:29] so now if there are two opposing views
[19:31] you both get to be right
[19:34] this is destructive and leaves no
[19:36] absolute
[19:38] this is what this gentleman said it's
[19:39] destructive and it leaves no
[19:41] no absolute today
[19:44] unbelief is running rampant it's running
[19:48] rapid
[19:48] and and i and this is just i guess
[19:51] what's been on my heart is because
[19:52] unbelief is running rapid
[19:54] it would seemingly be that god's word
[19:57] doesn't stand
[19:59] it would seemingly be that way because
[20:02] because of the unbelief it says that he
[20:04] went into his own city and
[20:06] and because of their unbelief he could
[20:08] not perform
[20:10] many mighty miracles he couldn't perform
[20:13] the works he was doing everywhere else
[20:14] because of their unbelief
[20:16] and unbelief the atmosphere is unbelief
[20:19] today
[20:20] and because of that atmosphere it it god
[20:23] god gets hindered brother branham would
[20:25] talk about the united states and he said
[20:27] they just they just have the hardest
[20:29] time believing god's word
[20:31] and if that was back then what is it
[20:33] today
[20:34] it's multiplied hell hath enlarged
[20:37] itself and it just seems like it keeps
[20:39] getting bigger and bigger and greater
[20:40] and greater
[20:44] luke 16 31 says my my
[20:47] and this is my words though one be
[20:49] raised from the dead they shouldn't be
[20:51] persuaded
[20:52] if they won't hear the prophet god sent
[20:54] to the age and the ministers god sends
[20:56] them now
[20:57] then they won't hear see something
[20:58] seemingly as miraculous
[21:00] as someone coming back from the dead
[21:03] i'll give you an example
[21:05] saul had samuel raised from the dead and
[21:08] afterwards i don't see any scripture
[21:10] that says he repented after that
[21:12] he didn't repent after that so even
[21:14] though someone was raised up from the
[21:16] dead
[21:17] who he knew that they died and he could
[21:19] identify him
[21:20] he didn't repent and didn't do nothing
[21:22] for his spiritual state
[21:29] just bear with me as i just follow the
[21:31] mind of the lord here
[21:36] brother branham says in one spot they
[21:38] don't want to see it they won't listen
[21:39] to it
[21:40] jesus in his journey here on earth he
[21:42] said well did isaiah
[21:44] speak of you you got eyes and can't see
[21:46] in ears and can't hear
[21:49] now in this day i've always thought that
[21:51] the that you know when it when the
[21:53] scripture talked about crucifying christ
[21:55] again i thought lord i don't want to
[21:57] crucify you again
[21:58] and i always thought that that meant
[22:02] something along the lines of when you
[22:04] when you sin
[22:05] or or when you're
[22:08] when you're doing something that that
[22:10] you know you know is is
[22:12] wrong and you do it anyway and i always
[22:13] think you know well maybe that's
[22:15] crucifying christ again or
[22:17] or you know something along those lines
[22:19] but
[22:21] listening to indictment when brother
[22:24] branham's indicting this generation for
[22:26] crucifying christ again
[22:28] he tells them he says it's because
[22:33] it's because they deny the effects of
[22:35] the word
[22:37] they they they deny
[22:40] and and they they take away from the
[22:43] people
[22:44] that the the manifestation and the
[22:46] vindication of the word of god
[22:49] and they they take that from them and
[22:50] they say well this this can't be for
[22:52] this day
[22:54] and and this is just my my personal
[22:56] opinion on it now is that
[22:58] the reason that they would say that is
[23:00] because they can't make it live
[23:02] because they couldn't produce it and
[23:04] because
[23:05] in their minds in man's mind if i can't
[23:07] produce it then it can't be true
[23:11] and by that by their unbelief
[23:15] they crucify the the effects of the word
[23:19] on the people
[23:24] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[23:27] us
[23:28] and the word today will be made flesh
[23:32] and dwell among us there will be a
[23:34] people on this earth
[23:36] who the word becomes flesh in them
[23:39] jesus christ will live through them
[23:41] again
[23:43] through a many-membered body so
[23:46] it doesn't matter what people say it
[23:48] doesn't listen to me
[23:50] i don't care what your opinion is i
[23:53] don't care what my opinion is
[23:55] if it would be contrary to the word i
[23:57] tell you tonight
[23:59] the word is true i tell you tonight
[24:02] that the word will live in a people
[24:04] regardless of what this generation says
[24:07] regardless of what satan tells you about
[24:10] yourself
[24:10] the word will be made manifest
[24:15] because something's been deposited in
[24:17] you you didn't put it there
[24:19] i didn't put it in you jesus christ put
[24:22] it in you before the foundation of the
[24:24] world
[24:25] so it has to be so amen
[24:30] regardless of the atmosphere of unbelief
[24:32] god's word is true
[24:41] now let's just let's go back to our
[24:43] opening scripture and i'm going to
[24:46] i'm going to follow the leading of the
[24:48] lord
[24:49] i might take it a little slow because
[24:51] i'm just trying to be sensitive of what
[24:52] he wants
[24:54] so back to this opening scriptures the
[24:57] word is sown in the hearts of those
[25:00] whose heart is likened to a road or a
[25:03] path the first ground that the scripture
[25:05] describes it's like into a road or a
[25:07] path
[25:08] and it says the enemy comes immediately
[25:10] following the seed hitting the path
[25:12] and forcefully takes it brother branham
[25:15] used that word he says he
[25:16] the enemy would come and he would
[25:18] forcefully take the word
[25:20] the amplified says he takes the message
[25:22] that was sown
[25:23] in their hearts the message that was
[25:26] sown in their hearts
[25:27] satan comes and he swiftly takes it
[25:30] and i got to thinking about this and i
[25:32] thought well why would that be why would
[25:34] something like that happen and
[25:35] and i just thought well maybe it was it
[25:37] was through the way they were raised
[25:40] maybe they were raised in a home that
[25:42] didn't believe in god
[25:44] or they had a a poor image in a daddy on
[25:47] this earth
[25:48] and your image in your daddy is the
[25:51] image that you'll take of your heavenly
[25:53] father
[25:54] because that's your first image of what
[25:57] of what god is of what
[25:58] authority is in your life of of of
[26:02] everything your parents are your
[26:03] everything when you're little
[26:06] you might not feel that way today or or
[26:09] uh you know teenagers probably
[26:11] definitely don't feel that way
[26:13] but you know they they are they when you
[26:16] were little you might not even remember
[26:17] it but they're your everything my little
[26:19] boy walks around the house and and
[26:21] he doesn't say too much yet so you know
[26:23] pray for him if you would with me but
[26:25] he walks around and the one word that he
[26:27] does say is da
[26:28] and he says it like that
[26:33] cutest thing
[26:37] but it's it's the image and and i and
[26:39] and as a father
[26:41] i want to make sure that i portray a
[26:43] good image to it
[26:44] i want to be sure that i i portray a
[26:47] good image to my daughters
[26:49] listen dads if you don't date your
[26:51] daughters
[26:52] i would recommend that you do that and
[26:55] as
[26:57] strange as that might sound because
[27:00] i i heard a brother say it like this one
[27:02] time you know they
[27:04] his little girls um he had a number of
[27:06] them and they they always wanted to play
[27:07] house and they said well
[27:09] you be you be the daddy and i'll be the
[27:10] mommy and he said
[27:12] i'm not a pervert you know he said i'm
[27:14] not gonna do that
[27:15] but the so i hope that didn't offend you
[27:19] but but you know you do it it feels
[27:21] funny though
[27:24] real quiet that's all right i'll preach
[27:26] anyhow because i i know it's ringing
[27:27] true whether you say amen or not
[27:30] but you know it it just it feels weird
[27:33] you know you're like
[27:34] but it's you know i'm daddy i i am your
[27:36] dad and you're my daughter and it's not
[27:38] supposed to be that way but
[27:39] you know you're doing innocent things
[27:41] you know well here let me cook for you
[27:43] and you do this and
[27:44] you know and that and and you know if
[27:46] you don't date him
[27:47] somebody else will that's my point if
[27:49] you don't date them somebody else will
[27:52] and there's many situations and and
[27:54] there was one that i know of
[27:56] and and our pastor told uh
[27:59] you know told a young girl he said he
[28:02] said listen if you don't
[28:03] stop down the road you're going this is
[28:05] going to happen in this and this and
[28:06] this is where you'll be
[28:07] well sure enough that's where she's at
[28:09] today
[28:11] and it was a it was it to me it stemmed
[28:13] back from a poor home life
[28:15] it was constant fighting between mommy
[28:18] and daddy
[28:19] listen that's your sweetheart friends
[28:23] that's your sweetheart you're not it's
[28:24] not supposed to be a war zone in your
[28:26] home
[28:27] if it's a war zone i can tell you you're
[28:30] off the word
[28:31] you're not even following the message
[28:33] and you need to go back and and you need
[28:35] to you need to pray or something pray
[28:37] through
[28:37] because that's not the way it's supposed
[28:39] to be amen
[28:40] if if you if you didn't have a good
[28:42] image in your home
[28:44] then take my word for it there's a
[28:46] better way than what you were raised
[28:48] with
[28:49] amen
[28:57] brother branham said i believe is where
[28:58] i got this one from is maybe satan comes
[29:00] right after
[29:01] the word is sown and gives them a word
[29:03] contrary to the truth they just heard
[29:06] and it withers away puts a question in
[29:08] their mind
[29:09] they get caught in between two opinions
[29:13] and it takes the word away and chokes it
[29:16] out
[29:19] the next was stony ground ones who
[29:22] received the word immediately with
[29:24] gladness
[29:26] the scripture says but there's there's
[29:28] no ground to get rooted in
[29:31] so after a while their zeal fizzles out
[29:34] as the tests and trials of life come in
[29:38] and listen i believe that as christians
[29:42] we can experience each of these seasons
[29:44] in our life
[29:47] so i can tell you're listening tently
[29:52] and i just ask you to let me minister to
[29:53] you tonight
[29:59] i meant to say this before and i don't
[30:00] say it right now as we're going into
[30:02] this stony ground but i just
[30:04] just want to give my my
[30:08] sympathy and my thoughts um and our
[30:12] let the sanchez family know that we we
[30:14] were praying for you
[30:16] we continue to pray for you um
[30:19] you've all been through a lot and a lot
[30:22] of loss
[30:22] and i just want to tell you that from on
[30:25] behalf of brother paul
[30:27] and the church we love you and god will
[30:30] give you strength
[30:32] god will give you strength
[30:38] you can you can you can see it in your
[30:41] eyes
[30:42] god will give you god bless you
[30:48] probably a bad spot to throw that in
[30:50] right there
[30:52] i just felt that overwhelming feeling
[30:56] so the next was the stony ground
[31:01] notice the problem now in this situation
[31:05] is because of what they go through their
[31:07] heart becomes hardened
[31:10] what they use to live their lives after
[31:12] and correct everyone else
[31:14] and the critical be critical of
[31:15] everybody else
[31:20] they find themselves doing it
[31:23] they become offended at the word which
[31:24] is christ
[31:29] would you let me switch gears here a
[31:31] minute
[31:40] the english definition of the word
[31:42] offended
[31:43] means to transgress or violate the moral
[31:47] or divine law
[31:49] to do wrong to cause difficulty
[31:51] discomfort
[31:52] or injury dislike anger vexation hurt
[31:56] to cause to sin or fall
[32:00] jesus said in matthew 18
[32:05] verse 7 says woe unto the world because
[32:08] of offenses
[32:11] woe into the world because of offenses
[32:13] but i want you to catch something here
[32:15] now i want to i want to focus on the on
[32:17] the hard heart
[32:18] i want to focus on the stony ground
[32:22] he says whoa because the test and trials
[32:26] came
[32:26] and the scripture says they were
[32:28] offended
[32:30] they were offended because of the tests
[32:32] and trials
[32:34] and jesus said for it must needs
[32:38] be that offense has come but woe to the
[32:41] man by whom the offense cometh
[32:44] luke 17 says it like this verse 1 then
[32:47] said he unto the disciples it is
[32:48] impossible
[32:50] but that offenses will come but woe unto
[32:52] him through whom they come
[33:00] jesus said here
[33:03] that you actually have a need
[33:06] for offenses
[33:10] you have a need for offenses to come in
[33:12] your life
[33:13] you have a need for tests and trials
[33:16] to come into your life
[33:22] we live in a world of human beings that
[33:25] are born into sinful flesh with sinful
[33:27] natures
[33:29] and we're going to have offenses come
[33:32] we live in bodies of flesh that that
[33:35] live and die
[33:38] they get sick they they experience
[33:41] financial hardships
[33:45] that's this life and we're in this body
[33:49] and tests and trials will come
[33:52] offenses will come
[34:00] the greek uses the term in this this
[34:03] offended
[34:05] says to cause a person to begin to
[34:07] distrust and desert one whom he ought to
[34:10] trust and obey
[34:14] one whom we ought to trust and obey
[34:17] jesus in in the set of scriptures there
[34:20] he's talking about
[34:21] the little ones the little children and
[34:22] he says there you know the disciples are
[34:25] in a little scuff
[34:26] of who's going to be the greatest in the
[34:27] kingdom of heaven and jesus calls over
[34:30] the little children and sets them in the
[34:31] midst of him and he says
[34:34] except you be as these you won't enter
[34:36] the kingdom of god
[34:38] and our pastor was bringing out he said
[34:40] you know a child they just
[34:41] they just trust and obey like we said
[34:45] your your children's everything they
[34:47] just they have such an
[34:49] innocence about them they haven't had
[34:51] the testing trials that they just
[34:53] if you say red is blue they're going to
[34:55] believe you
[34:56] if you say white is black they believe
[34:58] you because because you're either
[35:00] everything they just you're they're
[35:03] absolute
[35:04] when they're young and notice the
[35:07] scripture the
[35:08] the the word jesus says you will be
[35:11] offended
[35:12] you will have offenses come that's a
[35:14] promise to you
[35:17] but its offense is is
[35:21] to begin to distrust and desert one whom
[35:23] you trust and obey
[35:24] jesus is saying these trust and obey me
[35:28] these little ones just believe i'm god
[35:30] they believe if i
[35:31] if the words that i tell them i can i
[35:34] can be
[35:34] free in the midst of these children
[35:36] because they just believe
[35:39] and that's the way we're supposed to be
[35:42] we're supposed to be
[35:43] as children we're supposed to believe
[35:44] god we're supposed to trust and obey
[35:47] we're supposed to believe his word when
[35:50] we hear it
[35:51] we're supposed to believe his word when
[35:52] we read it
[35:55] you're supposed to trust and obey god
[35:58] but these offenses come and the in the
[36:02] the danger is that they would make you
[36:06] distrust
[36:06] who you ought to trust and obey
[36:17] it's amazing to me that the ground is is
[36:20] hard
[36:21] and it's stony and the word of god
[36:23] couldn't take root but when
[36:26] bitterness comes when they become
[36:29] offended
[36:31] bitterness can take root so think about
[36:35] that a moment the ground
[36:37] was not was not ripe or or
[36:40] fixed as that it could receive the word
[36:43] it could receive the word when it
[36:45] sprouted when it was trying to take root
[36:47] in the life
[36:48] but the root of bitterness must have
[36:50] some strength to it
[36:52] to be able to penetrate the stoning
[36:54] ground you know some plants
[36:55] can you can throw them i i work for a
[36:58] landscape company and i forget what kind
[37:00] it was maybe a hosta or something like
[37:02] that and they
[37:03] they said yeah you could throw that on
[37:04] the asphalt or on the
[37:06] on the concrete sidewalk and they said
[37:08] it would grow
[37:10] it's just some plants are hardy like
[37:12] that take another one and you take it
[37:15] out of that soil that it's drawing its
[37:17] moisture and its nutrients from
[37:19] and you throw it on the on the concrete
[37:21] next to the hosta and it'll shrivel up
[37:23] and die
[37:25] it's just some something about that is
[37:28] is
[37:28] i don't even want to call it hearty
[37:31] maybe harsh is the right word
[37:33] because bitterness is so harsh in our
[37:35] lives
[37:36] bitterness will rob your joy bitterness
[37:40] will steal your happiness
[37:42] bitterness will bind you when you ought
[37:44] to be free
[37:46] but the but the the the difficult part
[37:50] about what jesus is saying and and what
[37:52] this what jesus is saying in our parable
[37:56] is it's the word that was being sown
[37:59] the seed is the word the word was sown
[38:03] and and it's not that they're just
[38:05] becoming offended at life
[38:07] and and they're going to go on with god
[38:09] they become offended at the word
[38:12] and that's and it's a detriment it's a
[38:14] terrible place to be
[38:18] i've been there maybe i've said these
[38:20] things here and so you forgive me if i
[38:22] repeat myself
[38:24] i've been there before i've been
[38:27] years ago i've had a bitter heart i had
[38:30] a hard heart
[38:32] i had it where i was coming into church
[38:36] performing my duty of being there
[38:39] going out to the car and just hoping
[38:41] nobody came and talked to me
[38:45] just just didn't want to talk to nobody
[38:48] became bitter at the man of god that was
[38:50] preaching
[38:52] offended by him offended by the ones
[38:56] who could help me the most who who would
[38:59] bring me closer to the word i became
[39:01] offended at them
[39:03] i took issue with them i became hard
[39:06] towards them
[39:07] i didn't want anything to do with them
[39:10] they walk in and you want to go the
[39:11] other way
[39:13] there's something wrong in your heart
[39:16] and i and i and i tell you that that
[39:19] maybe you could draw something from my
[39:20] life
[39:21] and and maybe see a reflection of
[39:23] yourself if you're there today
[39:31] god never promised us a flowery bed of
[39:33] ease
[39:36] god actually promised that this life
[39:38] would be full of tests and trials
[39:41] god promised god promised that you would
[39:45] experience sorrow
[39:48] god promised that you would experience
[39:51] life
[39:52] and you'd experience death
[39:56] god promised that offenses would come
[40:02] the the the thing about a
[40:06] a stoney heart
[40:09] or or offended heart
[40:13] and you you forgive me i just feel
[40:16] overwhelming feeling just now
[40:20] our pastor was was talking about this
[40:23] along these along this line too and
[40:25] he said you know it's it's so difficult
[40:28] because
[40:30] something inside can give up
[40:33] something inside of you can actually
[40:35] give up
[40:37] and you become offended you be you
[40:40] become hurt
[40:41] the tests and trials of this life are
[40:44] seemingly too heavy
[40:48] have i preached this before here is this
[40:50] okay
[40:52] okay all right thank you
[40:57] something in your heart gives up though
[41:00] nobody in here would know it
[41:03] you could be sitting here tonight
[41:06] you could even you could even take and
[41:10] and you know i just well i won't use
[41:12] that example but
[41:14] you can you can almost try to put on
[41:17] that smile
[41:19] and it takes all your effort but there
[41:21] it is
[41:23] there it is and here you are and
[41:27] you know everyone's gonna think you're
[41:28] okay
[41:30] and you don't really want them to ask
[41:32] you how you're doing
[41:34] and if they do you're going to just tell
[41:36] a little white lie
[41:37] and say i'm good i'm good fine oh
[41:41] everything's great because you've been
[41:42] around a little bit and you know the
[41:44] lingo
[41:46] you know the lingo and so
[41:50] you're you're expressing it here and i
[41:52] believe in positive confession
[41:55] i do believe in that don't get me wrong
[41:57] i don't want you you know
[41:58] if you're if somebody if every time
[42:00] someone asks you how you're doing
[42:02] and then they got to sit down and and
[42:04] wait an hour while you tell them all
[42:06] life's troubles
[42:08] you're not going to have to eventually
[42:10] they're going to stop asking you how
[42:11] you're doing
[42:16] but i'm just saying
[42:20] there is a sense of honesty that's okay
[42:23] to be honest about
[42:26] it's it's okay to say you know what i
[42:29] i'm
[42:29] i'm hurting right now
[42:33] it's okay to say and and i
[42:36] and i i don't remember the service but i
[42:38] i
[42:39] you know brother paul talks about the
[42:42] title of the service a lot
[42:44] brother barry when your retreat took a
[42:46] sermon
[42:47] and it was simply tile titled i'm
[42:49] struggling
[42:51] i'm struggling brother burley sorry
[42:55] i'm struggling it's okay to say
[43:00] you know i'm struggling right now
[43:04] and if you don't want to go into detail
[43:08] then just say just pray for me
[43:12] pray for me i'm struggling listen you're
[43:14] a part of a body here
[43:18] there shouldn't be any any looking down
[43:21] on somebody for being honest if that's
[43:23] where they're at
[43:25] that should be the time that you come
[43:27] together
[43:30] and you know sometimes they may not even
[43:32] watch you you should offer to pray for
[43:33] them right then
[43:35] but sometimes they may not want that and
[43:37] that's okay
[43:38] if you can't pray for them right then
[43:40] then take it take it in prayer later
[43:44] come come beside them in spirit come
[43:46] beside them and stand beside them hold
[43:48] them up
[43:48] lift them up they lifted the arms of
[43:52] moses
[43:53] and then the battle went on and they won
[43:55] the battle
[43:57] but sometimes you just have to say i'm
[44:00] struggling pray for me
[44:03] and lift your brother and sister up hold
[44:05] their arms up in prayer
[44:08] encourage them give them strength you'll
[44:11] you never know there there's battles
[44:14] daniel prayed for for you forgive me
[44:18] it's
[44:18] my my mind's going here and it's
[44:20] slipping my mind however many days he
[44:21] prayed
[44:24] and and and finally the angel came to
[44:27] him
[44:28] and what did the angel tell him said
[44:31] daniel i heard your cry
[44:33] the first time the first time you
[44:36] started praying
[44:38] i heard your cry the first time you
[44:41] uttered the words
[44:43] and you and you closed your prayer in
[44:45] the name of jesus christ
[44:48] he hears it but what was the delay
[44:53] in your answer what was the struggle
[44:55] with something in the spirit realm
[44:58] discouragement i believe is is probably
[45:02] one of the greatest tools of the enemy
[45:04] because if he can get you discouraged
[45:06] and distraught
[45:07] it's it's it's almost like you just lose
[45:10] faith
[45:12] and that's not to say that you're an
[45:14] unbeliever that's not just
[45:16] to put you down in any way but it's to
[45:18] say that
[45:19] you your faith just takes a hit
[45:24] you you you you just
[45:28] i don't know the words are just not
[45:31] coming but if you've been
[45:32] there you know what i'm talking about
[45:35] you just and part of you doesn't want to
[45:37] believe
[45:40] is that okay
[45:51] my help me lord
[46:00] it's just uh
[46:04] it's just discouraging and
[46:07] and discouragement can can
[46:11] can become offensive
[46:20] sometimes sometimes it's a hypocritical
[46:23] life that's been lived before you
[46:27] and and that's the image that you've
[46:29] seen and then you lose trust
[46:32] you lose trust in the ones that you
[46:34] should be able to trust
[46:36] you you why would you want to live that
[46:38] way when you have
[46:39] the hypocrite in front of you living
[46:41] like that
[46:42] and you you start i guess what's been
[46:45] burning on my heart is
[46:46] is to to have the realities of god
[46:50] to have the realities listen the reality
[46:53] of god
[46:54] is that if you're living a way that you
[46:56] shouldn't be the reality of god
[46:59] is to come in and change your life
[47:02] and if and if you've had a hypocrite
[47:04] image if you lived a hypocrite life
[47:07] god can change that god can come on the
[47:11] scene and he can quicken that seed
[47:13] that's in you
[47:14] and and clean up your life
[47:24] and you know sometimes sometimes we can
[47:27] become offended
[47:30] because we find ourselves living that
[47:32] way
[47:34] and we despise you despise the way
[47:39] you despise the way somebody is or
[47:41] something about them you maybe
[47:43] this is the example that comes came to
[47:45] mind was you grew up in a drunkard's
[47:47] home
[47:48] and you despised that thing you said
[47:51] i'll never
[47:52] drink like that i'll never do that
[47:55] and then maybe down the road in life
[47:59] maybe you find yourself doing that maybe
[48:03] you find yourself drinking
[48:06] or drinking a drunkard is an addiction
[48:08] maybe you find yourself addicted to
[48:10] something else
[48:13] maybe it's an addiction to pornography
[48:18] an addiction to to movies
[48:22] something that your flesh is is lusting
[48:24] after
[48:26] listen a lot of people blame god for
[48:28] things that's not god's fault
[48:32] are you with me is this too hard tonight
[48:37] you you
[48:40] james said god has not tempted any man
[48:46] but man is drawn away by their own lust
[48:50] and when lust conceives it bears sin
[48:55] and after sin follows death spiritual
[48:57] death
[48:59] but they become offended and they point
[49:01] that offense at god
[49:02] god why'd you make me this way remember
[49:04] the scripture says that the clay can't
[49:06] turn to the potter and say why have you
[49:08] made me thus
[49:11] sometimes friends it's your own lust
[49:15] that's that's that you're that's
[49:17] producing what's in your life
[49:20] and i and i say that not to beat you
[49:23] down
[49:24] i say that to tell you there's a better
[49:26] way
[49:27] and i say that to turn your offense off
[49:30] of god
[49:31] and turn it on to jesus not not not your
[49:34] offense
[49:35] uh and to take it off of god
[49:38] put your offense on the devil who's
[49:40] making you live that way
[49:41] but turn to jesus christ
[49:45] turn turn to god the very thing that you
[49:48] need and that you should be running to
[49:50] we we we all do it we run away from it
[49:54] but that's the very source of life that
[49:56] you need to go to
[50:01] yet somehow we find ourselves there too
[50:06] or will take the extreme opposite
[50:10] and and maybe you come from a legalistic
[50:13] background
[50:15] and it was real strong and hard and so
[50:18] bless god you're going to do everything
[50:20] not to be that way
[50:22] so instead you go and you're this way
[50:25] which is just as bad as legalism
[50:29] you're going to give yourself liberty
[50:30] because i never had these liberties but
[50:32] you what you need to do is instead of
[50:34] swinging way over here
[50:36] you need to come over here and find a
[50:38] balance a balanced
[50:40] life is is the best one you can live
[50:43] and if you don't know what that balance
[50:45] is ask god
[50:49] pray and ask ask father about it
[50:52] ask ask god to show you listen
[50:56] one of one of the things that's been
[50:58] striking my heart is
[50:59] if it's in here and god said live this
[51:03] way
[51:04] or i'd like you to i this is my word
[51:07] this is what pleases me
[51:10] and you don't understand it go ask the
[51:12] author about it
[51:15] go ask the one who wrote it
[51:18] if if if i authored a book
[51:21] and i gave it to you to read and you
[51:24] came back and you read it and you said
[51:26] i don't understand the point of this
[51:28] book
[51:30] you you have two options
[51:33] you can throw it in the trash and if i
[51:36] wrote a book you probably would want to
[51:38] do that
[51:39] or you could come talk to me and you
[51:42] could say
[51:43] hey and and in chapter 4
[51:47] i didn't understand what you meant can
[51:48] you explain that to me
[51:50] and i could explain my thoughts behind
[51:52] it and then oh
[51:54] okay now i can now i can see what you're
[51:56] trying to say
[51:57] oh okay if i wrote you a check
[52:01] and you took it to the bank and it
[52:04] bounced
[52:05] or they wouldn't cash it
[52:08] what if it was five thousand dollars i
[52:11] would like five thousand dollars
[52:14] you would like five thousand dollars i'm
[52:15] sure but if you took it and
[52:18] it wouldn't cash would you would you
[52:20] throw it in the garbage
[52:22] i would expect that my phone would ring
[52:24] and you'd say hey brandon i tried to
[52:26] cast that check and it didn't go through
[52:28] what's going on and i and i would i
[52:31] would look into it
[52:32] i i could explain it to you i could
[52:34] maybe see
[52:35] things that you couldn't see the bank
[52:38] account where you're trying to withdraw
[52:39] the money from
[52:41] and i could say oh that's simple
[52:45] this was the issue go back and try it
[52:47] again it'll go through
[52:50] this is what you got to do let me see
[52:52] the check what bank did you try to
[52:53] deposit it at
[52:55] what did you try to apply your faith to
[52:58] what was the motive and objective behind
[53:01] what you were asking when you asked god
[53:05] to cash the check for you father you
[53:08] said through a prophet that i could cash
[53:10] this thing
[53:12] but it didn't work what happened
[53:17] and then what if he said what if he said
[53:19] that to you
[53:20] what if he said well what was in your
[53:22] heart when you asked it
[53:25] what was on your mind when you when what
[53:27] was what was your motivation what was
[53:29] your drive for wanting that thing
[53:32] why didn't you get that job that you
[53:33] wanted what was the reason that you
[53:35] wanted that job
[53:39] or maybe father i didn't get the job
[53:42] that i wanted what
[53:43] i i don't understand and then you find
[53:46] out that it would have kept you
[53:47] away from home and
[53:51] and some of our jobs do that
[53:54] they require us to travel and things but
[53:57] i'll tell you brother if your job
[53:59] requires you to travel and be away from
[54:01] home a lot
[54:02] let me tell you from experience you
[54:04] better you better make good when you're
[54:05] home
[54:07] you better be plugged in when you're
[54:09] home because
[54:15] because i'll tell you i've watched it
[54:19] i i've and i wouldn't want him to feel
[54:23] bad if he ever
[54:24] if he ever heard this but i watched it
[54:26] in my my own
[54:27] dad i told you before my parents are
[54:30] divorced
[54:32] i watched it traveling a lot
[54:35] and and let me tell you brother
[54:38] do we have any travelers here am i
[54:40] speaking to miss don't you don't got to
[54:41] raise your hand that's okay
[54:43] maybe they're not here tonight because
[54:44] they're traveling
[54:47] they'll listen later but i'm just
[54:50] telling you that
[54:51] that if you don't make good when you're
[54:52] home and you don't plug in when you're
[54:54] home
[54:55] when you're gone or maybe you're not
[54:58] traveling maybe you're just out
[55:00] doing other things because uh i don't
[55:03] mean to pick on the young married couple
[55:04] but you know you
[55:06] you want me time and so you're gonna go
[55:09] and you're gonna do these things because
[55:10] this is what you used to do
[55:12] well uh again i don't mean this
[55:14] disrespectful
[55:15] news flash two become one you're one now
[55:18] you're married
[55:20] you don't you don't go somewhere without
[55:23] your significant other
[55:26] not all the time sometimes and sometimes
[55:29] it's okay
[55:30] we'll balance that out sometimes it's
[55:32] okay now she says no you ain't going
[55:34] nowhere without her
[55:37] your sweethearts it's okay you don't
[55:40] want to go nowhere without each other
[55:44] and let me tell you something i had
[55:46] people tell me
[55:47] in the church that that'll end someday
[55:50] it doesn't have to end
[55:51] right it doesn't have to end i don't
[55:53] care how old you are
[55:54] it doesn't have to end listen the
[55:56] message came
[55:57] and in this message with all of its
[55:59] great mysteries
[56:00] it said she's your sweetheart he's your
[56:03] sweetheart
[56:04] you ought to enjoy being around each
[56:05] other but that's let me get to my point
[56:09] as you as you start going and it gets
[56:11] let me
[56:12] let me say it this way it gets easier to
[56:14] go it gets easier to be away
[56:18] it gets easier to the point to where you
[56:20] don't you don't want to come home
[56:23] because you've gotten so used to this
[56:24] lifestyle boy am i stepping on your toes
[56:28] tonight
[56:31] it becomes easy to do that it becomes
[56:33] easy to go
[56:34] it becomes more difficult to come home
[56:39] i i don't mean to
[56:42] tell what i pray is his testimony
[56:44] someday
[56:46] but he my dad would come home and he
[56:49] would
[56:49] he would sit in the parking lot at the
[56:51] airport and cry because he didn't want
[56:53] to come home
[56:54] and there was other things listen there
[56:56] was there was there was things on both
[56:58] sides
[56:59] there was things on both sides there was
[57:01] just there was a decision made that was
[57:03] the final decision
[57:05] kind of tipped it over the edge but but
[57:07] there's things on both sides
[57:09] that that would that would sister
[57:12] you ought to make it a home that he
[57:13] wants to come home to
[57:17] i don't i don't i don't i don't kind of
[57:19] chuckle i just
[57:20] it's because i just imagine in being in
[57:22] your shoes and hearing the minister say
[57:24] these things and i hope it's not too
[57:26] hard
[57:27] i'm not going to apologize one of the
[57:29] things that that i i saw in the
[57:31] scripture was jesus didn't appo
[57:33] the disciples came to him and they said
[57:35] you know jesus you were pretty harsh on
[57:36] the pharisees just now
[57:38] calling them vipers and and you're of
[57:41] your father the devil
[57:43] you i we think you offended them i
[57:45] didn't find where jesus went back to the
[57:47] pharisees and said hey i'm sorry
[57:50] one of the things that i found is is you
[57:53] can't
[57:54] apologize if the word offends now to
[57:57] balance that out brother branham would
[57:58] say he'd say i'm sorry if that offended
[58:01] you
[58:01] but i got to tell you the truth
[58:04] forgive me if i offend you but i've got
[58:06] to tell you the truth
[58:08] forgive me forgive your pastor when he's
[58:10] when he's
[58:11] blasting the word over the pulpit and
[58:14] and it's and it's getting down at a
[58:16] practical level
[58:17] because he because god knows what you
[58:20] need
[58:21] he can't apologize for that and he
[58:23] shouldn't apologize for it
[58:25] and you shouldn't want him to apologize
[58:27] for it there's something in
[58:28] in our hearts that says amen
[58:31] brother sam keep preaching keep
[58:34] preaching it no matter how hard it is
[58:36] it's not listen it's not it's it's not
[58:39] fun for a man of god to say these hard
[58:41] things because
[58:42] you love you love the people in your
[58:45] hearts for them
[58:46] but yet there's something in you and you
[58:47] just say if it helps them then i want to
[58:49] say it
[58:51] if it helps them then i want to minister
[58:53] to them but sis
[58:54] make make it a home that your husband
[58:56] wants to come home
[58:58] listen i i i set it up
[59:02] a couple wednesdays ago to a little
[59:04] church and i said
[59:06] i said listen sis flirt with him
[59:10] flirt with him he wants to be flirted
[59:14] with it's a need and a man that he needs
[59:16] to be flirted with and now i don't know
[59:19] i'm not older maybe that does
[59:22] fizzle out at some point but i wouldn't
[59:25] think
[59:25] that it would i would think that you you
[59:28] like to be sweethearts
[59:31] you know i i just i just can't imagine
[59:35] getting down the road and and not
[59:37] feeling like i'm on my honeymoon anymore
[59:41] is that is it is it a flowery bed of
[59:44] ease
[59:44] absolutely not you're gonna you're gonna
[59:47] have arguments
[59:48] you're gonna have disagreements you're
[59:51] you're gonna you're gonna have times
[59:53] when you don't
[59:54] maybe like that person very much
[59:58] you're gonna have times when when you
[1:00:01] offend them
[1:00:02] and they offend you
[1:00:05] i'm trying to remember our first
[1:00:06] argument
[1:00:11] i think i remember what it was and i
[1:00:13] would be telling them myself so
[1:00:15] we're just going to skip that
[1:00:25] i just let go
[1:00:28] say sweet things to her brother
[1:00:32] say say sweet sweet things
[1:00:35] to him sis he needs to know that you
[1:00:38] admire him
[1:00:39] and that and that he's your hero
[1:00:43] it might sound stupid and it probably is
[1:00:47] but that man needs to know that that
[1:00:49] he's he's your provider
[1:00:52] he needs to know that that he needs to
[1:00:55] know
[1:00:56] again it sounds odd but he needs to know
[1:00:58] that you find him attractive
[1:01:01] brother you better tell her she's pretty
[1:01:07] and eventually even if you don't
[1:01:11] you know sometimes see it eventually
[1:01:14] you'll see when when the
[1:01:17] the house is a mess and and she's had a
[1:01:20] stressful day
[1:01:21] in the in the in the kids are are going
[1:01:24] crazy
[1:01:25] and her and her hair isn't done or or
[1:01:28] she didn't she didn't get any time for
[1:01:29] herself
[1:01:30] no insist should be in your heart but
[1:01:33] know that that's
[1:01:33] it was her heart to do that but it just
[1:01:35] didn't work out that way
[1:01:38] but you should see the beauty in that
[1:01:41] you should you should listen one of the
[1:01:44] greatest things i think i've ever heard
[1:01:46] i believe it was brother tim dodd at a
[1:01:47] men's meeting and he said he
[1:01:49] brother branham come in to the home and
[1:01:51] and things were going
[1:01:53] just crazy and and it was all
[1:01:56] the house was a mess and the kids were
[1:01:58] crying the wife was crying there was
[1:02:00] people outside lined up everywhere
[1:02:02] and he said it was just chaos for the
[1:02:04] wife and she was
[1:02:06] i think she might have been over there
[1:02:07] trying to do the dishes and she's
[1:02:09] she's crying and she's had a hard day
[1:02:11] and kids are
[1:02:12] crying and the toys are everywhere and
[1:02:14] and brother tim said and brother branham
[1:02:16] did the most spiritual thing
[1:02:19] that could ever be done and he put one
[1:02:22] foot
[1:02:22] in the living room and one foot in the
[1:02:24] kitchen and he raised his hand
[1:02:27] like the angel in revelations 10
[1:02:31] and then he grabbed an apron and he put
[1:02:33] it on
[1:02:35] he didn't say peace everybody be still
[1:02:38] daddy's home
[1:02:41] sis brother branham said put a bow in
[1:02:43] your hair when i get home
[1:02:45] he didn't say that what did he do
[1:02:49] he went over and he got the kids settled
[1:02:51] down he he got to play on blocks with
[1:02:53] them helping them build blocks and put
[1:02:55] it
[1:02:55] put it together got them settled and
[1:02:57] then he walked over to his wife
[1:03:00] and he just stroked her back a little
[1:03:02] bit
[1:03:03] and he said it and and probably i can't
[1:03:05] remember the quote fully but maybe he
[1:03:06] said it's okay honey
[1:03:08] i know it's hard it's been a hard day
[1:03:10] but he said the whole time he's praying
[1:03:11] in his heart
[1:03:12] saying father let my peace let my
[1:03:16] peace pass to her let her feel peace
[1:03:21] and then what did he do the most manly
[1:03:24] thing a man could do
[1:03:26] and he stuck his hands in the water and
[1:03:28] started washing dishes
[1:03:31] listen you might think it sounds weird
[1:03:33] but
[1:03:34] i think your wife is going to be
[1:03:36] attracted to that
[1:03:42] and then he started just talking and he
[1:03:44] said honey maybe we'll go down and we'll
[1:03:46] check out that dress you've been wanting
[1:03:47] to buy
[1:03:49] one of man's things that he hates the
[1:03:51] most is to go shopping
[1:03:54] but let me tell you brother sometimes
[1:03:57] she just wants you to go with her
[1:03:59] and i read this book um oh my goodness
[1:04:08] um i read this book one time
[1:04:13] and uh he's describing the differences
[1:04:17] in men and women
[1:04:19] and he says you know you know when a guy
[1:04:22] i'm trying to think like a guy has a
[1:04:24] hunting story or he goes fishing and
[1:04:26] and you know he wants to tell his wife
[1:04:28] about it and honey i caught a fish and
[1:04:30] oh i tell you it was real big
[1:04:32] she could care less about that
[1:04:35] well brother when when your sister's
[1:04:37] telling you about her shopping
[1:04:39] experience
[1:04:40] and and and my wife wanted the the link
[1:04:43] so

[1:04:46] tonight

[1:04:50] the greatest at this
[1:04:52] but i'll tell you what i'll tell you
[1:04:53] what i'm guilty of and brothers don't do
[1:04:55] this
[1:04:56] is is i'll have my phone out and she's
[1:04:59] talking and she's telling me about her
[1:05:00] shopping experience
[1:05:02] and i'm and i'm listening but i'm not
[1:05:04] completely listening
[1:05:06] and i'm just trying to you know i that
[1:05:08] sounds terrible
[1:05:10] i don't mean it to be that way but
[1:05:12] really what it's doing is you're trying
[1:05:13] to fulfill your duty and listen to her
[1:05:16] but listen she's wanting to tell the
[1:05:18] fish story
[1:05:19] she's wanting to tell you i got you know
[1:05:21] i look at the deals i got and you're
[1:05:23] thinking
[1:05:24] and you're you're spending money still
[1:05:27] so

[1:05:30] but she's telling you the sales and
[1:05:32] she's telling you what what interests
[1:05:34] her and
[1:05:34] and if if and this author was saying if
[1:05:37] you watch two women when they're talking
[1:05:38] about their stories
[1:05:40] and oh you know it's it's the tone of
[1:05:42] voice they're getting into it with them
[1:05:43] and
[1:05:44] you know oh and and i and i didn't get
[1:05:46] that sale oh
[1:05:47] you didn't get that sale oh that's
[1:05:49] terrible and that's how sisters talk
[1:05:52] so brothers let you know when your wife
[1:05:54] is talking to another sister kind of
[1:05:55] tune in and see
[1:05:56] what's that sister's response and how
[1:05:58] she's doing because that's really what
[1:06:00] your response needs to be
[1:06:04] you know you you take interest in in the
[1:06:06] in the things with one another
[1:06:10] and and we're just way off of everything
[1:06:12] that i had
[1:06:15] is is this okay amen
[1:06:21] but i'll tell you and and brothers
[1:06:25] she she needs a man who can lead in
[1:06:28] family altar
[1:06:31] if you don't do devotions
[1:06:34] young un unmarried if you ain't married
[1:06:36] yet
[1:06:37] get this established now consider this
[1:06:40] your your training ground
[1:06:42] for for for what marriage will be like
[1:06:44] later
[1:06:45] do your devotions get down and
[1:06:49] read your bible and pray make it a daily
[1:06:51] thing
[1:06:52] you might not be able to do that every
[1:06:54] day when you're married
[1:06:56] you husbands you you older ones you
[1:06:58] might not be able to do it
[1:07:00] and i don't mean this as a joke but you
[1:07:02] know you older ones you might
[1:07:03] you might fall asleep while you're doing
[1:07:04] it
[1:07:06] but you should you should still do it
[1:07:09] you get in trouble after that but but
[1:07:14] you should you should still do it you
[1:07:15] should still make that a part of your
[1:07:17] home
[1:07:17] especially you you younger brothers with
[1:07:19] young families make that a part of your
[1:07:21] home
[1:07:22] you might not get it every day but i'll
[1:07:24] i'll tell you this
[1:07:25] there's times that i've noticed when i
[1:07:26] don't pray with my kids before they go
[1:07:28] to bed
[1:07:29] they wake up with a bad dream but
[1:07:31] there's
[1:07:32] for whatever reason maybe it's because
[1:07:35] we're the priests of our homes
[1:07:38] but if if i pray for him and last
[1:07:40] night's an example and and
[1:07:42] listen sis you have just as much
[1:07:44] authority to pray for your children as
[1:07:46] your husband does
[1:07:47] i'm just i'm just i'm trying to help you
[1:07:49] out
[1:07:51] but i'm i'm just saying this because
[1:07:52] like last night my little boy woke up
[1:07:55] at uh 3 30 and my wife went up and got
[1:07:58] him and he was standing with his blanket
[1:08:00] and his teddy and
[1:08:01] he just seemed scared and i remember her
[1:08:03] bringing him down
[1:08:04] changing his diaper you know taking him
[1:08:06] back up and she told me today she said i
[1:08:08] laid him down and i prayed with him
[1:08:09] well he woke up an hour later and and he
[1:08:12] did the same thing he was
[1:08:13] he was crying real hard like something
[1:08:15] scared him
[1:08:16] so i went this time brothers you should
[1:08:18] do that give your wife a break
[1:08:20] i went up and i did that and and uh you
[1:08:24] know he was standing there and i thought
[1:08:25] and you know kind of the less
[1:08:27] compassionate side of the two i'm
[1:08:28] thinking i can get him out of that crib
[1:08:30] so i laid him down i i covered him back
[1:08:33] up
[1:08:33] i prayed with him and uh and before i
[1:08:37] left he he you know he settled down and
[1:08:39] he just kind of
[1:08:41] kind of like a piece came over him you
[1:08:42] know so brother she
[1:08:44] you pray with your kids
[1:08:48] pray with your kids i see these little
[1:08:50] faces you know listening intently on
[1:08:52] that they
[1:08:52] they want you to pray daddy they they
[1:08:55] want to hear from you
[1:08:57] sometimes um i gotta i gotta let you
[1:09:00] stand and
[1:09:01] bring it to a close you can stand to
[1:09:03] your feet
[1:09:04] sometimes you know daddy can't be around
[1:09:09] sometimes cis you know it's
[1:09:12] it's it's a bad situation life didn't go
[1:09:14] the way that you thought it should and
[1:09:16] daddy's not there
[1:09:18] i i you have just as much authority
[1:09:23] brother branham called you what was it
[1:09:25] the the
[1:09:26] the fifth gospel the fifth gospel
[1:09:30] you're ministering to those kids sis
[1:09:33] your
[1:09:34] your daddy's not home during the day who
[1:09:36] has them you do
[1:09:37] and you're ministering to them you're
[1:09:39] you're the image of christ in their life
[1:09:46] so we started talking about offenses and
[1:09:48] we ended up here
[1:09:51] but i i just i pray something spoke to
[1:09:53] you tonight i pray
[1:09:55] i i say that because it's all of those
[1:09:57] situations when life doesn't go the way
[1:09:59] that you thought it should
[1:10:00] you become offended
[1:10:04] you you you cis when he doesn't do those
[1:10:08] things you can become offended
[1:10:10] brother when she doesn't do those things
[1:10:12] you can become offended that's how we
[1:10:14] got there
[1:10:14] is your hearts can start growing apart
[1:10:18] and and and it's just the same with with
[1:10:21] your relationship with christ you don't
[1:10:24] you don't
[1:10:26] listen god answers every prayer god
[1:10:29] answers every
[1:10:30] prayer the disciples said father teach
[1:10:33] us how to pray
[1:10:34] and what was jesus response thy will be
[1:10:37] done
[1:10:37] on earth as it is in heaven
[1:10:41] so we don't understand everything we
[1:10:43] don't understand why life goes a certain
[1:10:45] way
[1:10:46] we don't understand why god didn't
[1:10:48] answer the way that we wanted him to
[1:10:50] and if you're not careful you can become
[1:10:52] offended by that
[1:10:54] but just know father has a greater
[1:10:58] picture
[1:10:58] than mine he's looking at it different
[1:11:01] than you can see
[1:11:03] he's he's looking at a big picture
[1:11:09] does that minister to you do you
[1:11:12] understand
[1:11:14] i encourage you don't become offended
[1:11:18] trust daddy trust daddy
[1:11:24] trust the lord with all your heart and
[1:11:26] lean not on your own understanding
[1:11:28] in all thy ways acknowledge him and
[1:11:31] he'll direct your path
[1:11:34] you don't know what way to go you don't
[1:11:37] know what the next step
[1:11:38] is for your life ask daddy about it
[1:11:44] ask ask god listen he didn't only write
[1:11:49] this book it said your life was written
[1:11:53] in the lamb's book of life before the
[1:11:55] foundation of the world
[1:11:57] your life might not necessarily be in
[1:12:00] here completely
[1:12:03] but he also authored your life he's the
[1:12:06] author and the finisher of the faith
[1:12:11] go ask daddy about it
[1:12:15] one more testimony before i let you go
[1:12:20] going through what i did with my family
[1:12:23] um
[1:12:28] i i had a hard time with the word daddy
[1:12:32] because that was what was always that
[1:12:34] was the term that was always used with
[1:12:36] daddy
[1:12:36] daddy daddy loves you daddy does steady
[1:12:39] that
[1:12:41] we've we've got a a decent relationship
[1:12:44] now it's
[1:12:44] where the lord's restoring
[1:12:48] but i became that word that word was
[1:12:51] offensive to me
[1:12:53] and even when my
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:13:02] sorry
[1:13:07] even when my kids would come and
[1:13:12] it's an awful place to be when your kids
[1:13:18] come to call you daddy
[1:13:22] and because they use that word it steps
[1:13:24] on your pain
[1:13:25] and so you close off to it you don't you
[1:13:29] don't really want to
[1:13:31] to go there because something happened
[1:13:34] in your life
[1:13:36] but one thing that
[1:13:40] that god told me
[1:13:43] was that i have a heavenly father
[1:13:48] and it says the spirit in us cries abba
[1:13:51] father
[1:13:53] which is daddy daddy and when i saw that
[1:13:57] i thought there is a real image of daddy
[1:14:01] that word isn't a bad thing
[1:14:05] there there is a there is a daddy there
[1:14:07] is an image of a daddy
[1:14:08] there's images in this church of real
[1:14:10] daddies there's images in this church of
[1:14:13] a real husband
[1:14:14] there's images in this church of a real
[1:14:17] mom
[1:14:18] and a wife
[1:14:21] there's images in this church of a
[1:14:23] teenager that's living in laodicea
[1:14:26] there's images in this church of someone
[1:14:28] who's who's single and holding to christ
[1:14:30] and loves the lord with all of their
[1:14:32] heart
[1:14:33] there's images god has placed in the
[1:14:35] body
[1:14:37] so if if you draw a fence from one of
[1:14:40] those images
[1:14:42] let god show you the real image that
[1:14:44] he's put before you
[1:14:46] is that okay amen let's bow our hearts
[1:14:52] lord jesus we come before you god
[1:14:57] and just fill in a real sweet spirit
[1:14:59] lord i
[1:15:01] i uh i got to about the spot that i
[1:15:05] thought
[1:15:06] you wanted me to turn and you turned it
[1:15:08] in a different direction than i
[1:15:10] even thought
[1:15:15] and sometimes lord it can feel like just
[1:15:18] rambling lord but i pray that with every
[1:15:21] word that was spoken lord
[1:15:23] that you would let it strike good ground
[1:15:25] father the one we didn't get to was good
[1:15:28] ground
[1:15:30] lord let let the hearts be tender to
[1:15:32] your word let
[1:15:33] let every word fall where it may maybe
[1:15:36] they don't need it for right now but
[1:15:37] maybe they'll need it
[1:15:38] in a couple days or a couple couple
[1:15:41] weeks

[1:15:44] they'll remember something that was
[1:15:45] spoken tonight god i
[1:15:49] father you know my heart lord is to
[1:15:51] never say something that a pastor would
[1:15:53] have to get up and correct

[1:16:00] that the shepherd over this flock would
[1:16:03] find everything in order i pray that the
[1:16:05] the people lord would would find
[1:16:08] application to the word for their life
[1:16:12] and lord i just asked you i asked them
[1:16:16] lord by show of hands
[1:16:17] nobody else looking that if they've
[1:16:20] become offended
[1:16:23] if something in their heart has given up
[1:16:25] because of the tests and trials of this
[1:16:27] life
[1:16:29] if there's things they don't understand
[1:16:31] desires

[1:16:34] heart
[1:16:35] but have yet to be manifested and and it
[1:16:39] hurts them
[1:16:41] then i just ask them to lift their hand
[1:16:43] to the lord
[1:16:45] to be real honest with you
[1:16:49] and lord i pray you'd minister to them
[1:16:51] god i pray they would have been
[1:16:53] ministered tonight but i pray
