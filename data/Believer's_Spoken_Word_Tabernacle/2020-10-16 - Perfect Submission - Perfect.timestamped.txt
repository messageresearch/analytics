[26:49] evening

[26:52] appreciate musicians and
[26:55] brian taking that service there just on
[26:57] a moment's notice for the brian holder
[26:59] and stepping in and trying to
[27:01] do everything we can to try to satisfy
[27:05] some of the
[27:05] issues that come up here but we're just
[27:09] thankful to god that the lord has still
[27:11] made a way that we're here whether we
[27:12] had

[27:25] it's good to see each and every one of
[27:26] you some of you haven't uh
[27:27] haven't seen you different ones been on
[27:29] vacation and different things and

[27:34] sometimes when
[27:36] i get a little myself i get a little
[27:37] nervous about vacations i'm kind of a
[27:39] homebody
[27:40] if i never left home i'd be just as
[27:42] happy as happy could be
[27:44] i'm just happy with that part of it
[27:47] because sometimes you know how it is

[27:53] but uh
[27:54] we're just so so glad to be in the house

[28:09] come right here and speak to us tonight
[28:12] heavenly father lord we are just so
[28:15] thankful
[28:16] dear god for an opportunity that you
[28:18] have given and provided for us
[28:20] lord that we could be able to assemble
[28:22] ourselves together tonight your god
[28:25] lord truly not under that of a man but
[28:27] dear god under the leadership of the
[28:29] holy ghost
[28:30] because lord that's where we've been
[28:32] brought back under lord
[28:33] the leadership of the spirit of god
[28:35] through the word and lord we're so
[28:37] thankful we can't say thank you enough
[28:39] lord
[28:39] for what you've done for us in this hour
[28:41] lord you've brought us lord to reality
[28:44] lord
[28:44] light lord god has come upon our lives
[28:47] lord that we might
[28:48] lord know you and might be able to see
[28:50] who we are
[28:52] father we just ask tonight that lord god
[28:54] you would come
[28:55] and lord just speak to our hearts lord
[28:57] may you quicken the word to our hearts
[28:59] and
[28:59] us to the word lord and i pray that god
[29:02] that we would each and every one of us
[29:04] lord that's gathered here tonight
[29:05] whether
[29:06] here physically or by way of the
[29:07] internet lord may our hearts and our
[29:09] lives be changed lord god
[29:11] because you have come in our midst lord
[29:14] we pray
[29:14] we just ask that you would just take
[29:16] control now in the name of jesus christ
[29:19] amen amen let's begin reading at verse 1
[29:22] if we could
[29:23] the scripture said there is therefore
[29:25] now no condemnation
[29:27] to them which are in christ jesus
[29:31] who walk not after the flesh
[29:34] but after the spirit for the law of the
[29:37] spirit of life in christ
[29:39] hath made me free from the law of sin
[29:42] and death
[29:43] for what the law could not do in that it
[29:46] was weak
[29:46] through the flesh god sending his own
[29:49] son
[29:50] in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[29:52] sin
[29:53] condemns sin in the flesh that the
[29:56] righteousness
[29:57] of the law might be fulfilled in
[30:00] us who walk not after the flesh
[30:04] but after the spirit in verse 5 he says
[30:07] for they that are after the flesh do
[30:10] mind the things of the flesh but they
[30:13] that are after the spirit
[30:15] the things of the spirit for to be
[30:18] carnally minded
[30:19] is death but to be spiritually minded is
[30:22] life and peace because the carnal mind
[30:26] is enmity against god for it is not
[30:29] subject to the law of god neither
[30:31] indeed can be so then they that are
[30:35] in the flesh cannot please
[30:38] god but ye are not in the flesh but
[30:41] in the spirit if so be that the spirit
[30:43] of god
[30:44] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[30:47] spirit of christ
[30:49] he is none of his i'd like to just
[30:53] speak to you tonight on the thought of
[30:56] perfect
[30:57] submission perfect submission you may be
[31:00] seated i'm going to read a quote here as
[31:02] we get started
[31:04] here tonight i
[31:08] just want to say we just you know just
[31:10] thankful
[31:12] to the mercy of god for all that god has
[31:15] provided for us
[31:16] within this hour in the hebrew in the
[31:19] hebrew series brother branham makes this
[31:22] statement uh he says god then became in
[31:26] another type of a tabernacle
[31:28] and that tabernacle was who jesus
[31:32] and god was inside of jesus and he was
[31:34] hid
[31:35] but he was reconciling the world to
[31:38] himself
[31:39] by his expressions now that that's a
[31:41] very key
[31:43] part by his expressions christ revealed
[31:46] god think of it many
[31:47] he walked here upon the earth the bible
[31:50] says that he
[31:51] came to his own and his own received him
[31:54] not
[31:55] they who actually had all of the
[31:57] prophecies and
[31:59] everything that was laid out in the uh
[32:01] in the
[32:02] the law and the prophets and the psalms
[32:05] all of that was in there that would
[32:07] write or the word that was given that he
[32:10] would come
[32:11] to fulfill and express yet when he came
[32:14] he was a
[32:15] mystery to the world his own people who
[32:18] had this the gentiles remember
[32:20] the gentiles were without the covenants
[32:22] the promises of adoption any of those
[32:24] things
[32:24] but they who actually had these
[32:26] rehearsed to them
[32:28] knew them and who were promised to them
[32:30] they missed him
[32:32] but you see this is where it comes to to
[32:34] the reality
[32:35] the only way that you and i would know
[32:37] him is that is
[32:38] that in his expression there is
[32:40] something inside of you
[32:42] and i that is greater than our human
[32:44] intellect or any ability
[32:46] as a matter of fact it supersedes that
[32:47] passes beyond that
[32:49] and it's god who reaches down and
[32:50] captures what he already
[32:52] has sown within our life so brother
[32:54] brown goes on he says he was
[32:56] reconciling the world to himself by his
[32:58] expressions
[32:59] christ revealed god he said it's not me
[33:02] that doeth the works
[33:04] it's my father that dwelleth in me i do
[33:06] nothing in myself but what i see the
[33:08] father doing
[33:09] the father in me showing me these
[33:12] visions
[33:13] and then i go do just what the father
[33:15] told me to do
[33:16] he said you get it god was inside
[33:19] of a human body not behind goat skins
[33:23] died
[33:24] but was living moving god had hands
[33:28] god had feet god had had a tongue god
[33:31] had eyes
[33:32] and it was christ there he was now he
[33:34] went away
[33:36] and the spirit come in that through his
[33:38] death he might
[33:39] perfect the church and bring the church
[33:42] submissive
[33:43] now remember the word as we were looking
[33:45] on sunday imperfect or perfection
[33:48] it is dealing with the perfection of his
[33:51] own life
[33:52] perfection speaks of completion and the
[33:55] new birth itself
[33:56] is a completion of the very sovereign
[33:59] word of almighty god
[34:01] it's god who begins to work within our
[34:03] life drawing us to himself
[34:05] and then the completion the culmination
[34:08] is when god caps off our life with his
[34:10] own life
[34:11] and that is what makes the difference
[34:13] between you and i
[34:14] and the rest of the world it's not
[34:17] anything that we could do we can brag on
[34:19] but it's actually been the power of god
[34:21] moving upon our lives through the word
[34:24] that would lead us back home back to him
[34:26] to our true mate
[34:28] so brother baby says he might perfect
[34:30] the church
[34:31] and bring the church submissive then the
[34:34] same spirit that was in christ
[34:36] is in the church doing the same things
[34:39] christ did
[34:40] a little while and the world won't see
[34:41] me no more yet ye
[34:43] shall see me for i'll be with you even
[34:46] in you
[34:46] to the end of the world now i want you
[34:48] to just to think of this as we look at
[34:50] this thought here for a few moments
[34:52] on perfect submission uh because
[34:56] we were thinking of perfection and we
[34:58] look at this with submission we know
[35:00] uh that submission itself is not
[35:03] something that
[35:04] is uh the result of a demand uh neither
[35:07] is it something that is the result of a
[35:09] command in terms of
[35:11] of a law but it is something that really
[35:14] comes out
[35:14] of a true willingness it takes a real
[35:17] surrender
[35:18] and so when we're looking at this as
[35:20] paul would write this
[35:22] in here in the scripture paul is
[35:24] speaking to
[35:25] uh that of a life that is free from
[35:28] condemnation
[35:29] where you know within your heart in your
[35:32] life that you've been made free
[35:34] that the love of the world has taken the
[35:36] has taken the uppermost seat within your
[35:39] of the love of god sorry has taken the
[35:41] uppermost seat
[35:42] in your heart and life there's no
[35:44] there's no desires for the thing of the
[35:46] world
[35:46] anymore you can truly you have a
[35:49] testimony that
[35:50] the life that i once lived i don't live
[35:52] no more you have a testimony i've passed
[35:55] from death unto life
[35:56] it's not something that you can explain
[35:59] but you know it's real
[36:00] you know it's happened to you and you
[36:02] know that there's no more condemnation
[36:04] you're not the same
[36:06] man you're not the same woman you're not
[36:08] who you used to be
[36:09] but you are a new creation in the same
[36:11] old temple
[36:12] what did that god did that
[36:15] so paul would bring this in a measure in
[36:18] looking
[36:19] back here in romans the scriptures that
[36:21] we read
[36:22] here tonight and paul would deal with
[36:24] this in in separating
[36:26] that of of the carnal mind and that of
[36:29] the spiritual mind
[36:30] and we know when paul would write of
[36:32] this to be minded
[36:33] it deals with that which is to obey
[36:36] or to be under the control of one
[36:40] and here in verse 5 paul would say
[36:43] they that are after the flesh do mind
[36:45] the things of the flesh
[36:47] but they that are after the spirit the
[36:49] things
[36:50] of the spirit for to be carnally minded
[36:53] is
[36:53] death but to be spiritually minded is
[36:56] life
[36:57] and peace now when you think of in the
[36:59] scripture because we're dealing with
[37:01] carnal mind and spiritual mind and every
[37:03] one of us
[37:04] when we entered into this world we were
[37:07] born in sin
[37:08] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[37:09] speaking lives we entered
[37:11] in that of a carnal mind but yet there
[37:14] with god he placed that which is on the
[37:18] inside of us
[37:18] like the seed in the beginning in
[37:20] genesis 1 that was under the darkness
[37:23] and the condition
[37:24] and there needed to come a change of
[37:26] atmosphere in our life
[37:28] that would release that seed that had
[37:30] the potential within it to become what
[37:33] he had in his mind
[37:34] and spoke it to be so the only thing
[37:36] that could change the atmosphere
[37:38] would be the word itself and the word
[37:40] would actually come and begin to set in
[37:42] motion the earth and it what and it's
[37:45] the earth that had the seed within it
[37:47] you see what many people see is they can
[37:49] see finally
[37:50] in your life or my life here it begins
[37:53] to move
[37:54] into into the program of god but really
[37:56] what it is
[37:57] it's the seed of god that's coming under
[37:59] the effect and the authority of the word
[38:01] and it's changing the atmosphere and
[38:04] it's drawing this part of the earth
[38:06] because it's actually the seed that it's
[38:08] after it's coming to redeem that son
[38:11] or daughter of god that he foreknew
[38:13] before the foundation of the world
[38:15] once that once that experiences
[38:17] redemption brother then that can say one
[38:19] of these days
[38:20] this will experience a full redemption
[38:23] so when we look at it we know that as
[38:26] paul would write of it
[38:27] that uh in the carnal mind and the
[38:29] spiritual mind
[38:30] and and so many times you know brother
[38:32] branham would take this
[38:34] in 1965 when he preaches the message
[38:37] thirst and he would deal with it in
[38:39] terms of where many people he says are
[38:41] trying to live
[38:42] between these two many between the two
[38:45] desires
[38:46] a desire for the world and a desire to
[38:48] serve god a desire of the flesh and
[38:50] a desire of the soul and you know i
[38:53] think that it calls or behooves us
[38:55] uh as we look at it that you know god
[38:58] would speak
[38:59] in the old testament he would come
[39:01] around and speak in
[39:02] in the book of james that a
[39:04] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[39:07] ways
[39:08] he's unsure he's unstable and this is
[39:10] why
[39:11] there is no white black bird there's no
[39:14] drunk sober man
[39:15] there's no sinner saint that's why that
[39:17] in this age that god
[39:19] at the end of the age he spewed the
[39:21] church out of his mouth
[39:23] because the church was lukewarm he said
[39:25] i would that you were
[39:27] hot or cold in other words make up your
[39:30] mind
[39:30] what you're going to be and be that with
[39:33] all that's in your whole mind
[39:35] that's why brother branham could talk to
[39:37] brother billy brother billy paul
[39:38] and he said billy he said if you're
[39:40] going to be above you'd be the best
[39:42] bum you can be whatever you're gonna do
[39:45] you'd be the best you can be i believe
[39:48] tonight that i'm speaking to sons and
[39:50] daughters of god
[39:51] i'm speaking to hearts and lives that
[39:53] god has touched
[39:54] and i believe there's a desire on the
[39:56] inside we want to be
[39:58] a better christian we want to be as
[40:00] close to god
[40:01] we want to be the best christian that we
[40:04] can be we want to be
[40:05] close to him so close to him walking
[40:08] with him
[40:10] that's our desire
[40:13] and so when we we recognize that that
[40:16] paul would write of this that which is
[40:18] you know
[40:19] after the flesh they mind the things of
[40:20] the flesh you cannot require
[40:22] spiritual things of them they are minded
[40:25] in the flesh but
[40:26] they that are of the spirit they do mind
[40:28] the things of the spirit in other words
[40:30] when someone has come into that place of
[40:33] the spirit realm
[40:34] remember the carnal mind can't
[40:36] understand it the carnal mind would say
[40:38] moses why are you speaking to a rock
[40:40] everybody knows that's the driest thing
[40:42] in the world
[40:42] and it would also speak you know to noah
[40:45] why in the world are you talking about
[40:47] building an ark there's a flood coming
[40:49] and a rain is going to fall there ain't
[40:50] never ever been any rain
[40:52] but you see the spiritual mind it passes
[40:55] beyond the carnal mind
[40:56] the carnal mind is limited it's limited
[40:59] in power
[41:00] it's limited in authority but the
[41:02] spiritual mind
[41:03] there is no limitations as a matter of
[41:06] fact that carnal mind itself
[41:08] is a barrier but once you can go beyond
[41:11] that barrier
[41:12] you cross into unlimited places with god
[41:16] and you know what when your heart begins
[41:18] to desire for that as the prophet said
[41:21] there's a sound barrier to be broken
[41:24] so when we know this that how brother
[41:27] adam you know
[41:28] as he would lay and drop this down that
[41:30] in the scripture we find so clear
[41:33] that when we must be we must be
[41:36] born again they that are the flesh you
[41:38] know uh they
[41:39] they are there's uh which is born of the
[41:42] flesh is flesh and
[41:43] what's born of the spirit is spirit
[41:44] that's why we must be
[41:46] born again now brother adam would take
[41:49] this let's just look at this just for a
[41:50] moment
[41:51] in this of the mindedness the carnal
[41:53] mind and the spiritual mind of
[41:55] how each and every one of us here you
[41:57] know would come
[41:58] into this place ah you know
[42:01] into this life in this world brother
[42:03] brown would take take an example
[42:05] in that of the message paradox and as
[42:08] he's looking at this
[42:10] in here in the message paradox he deals
[42:12] with how
[42:13] that a life itself there is absolutely
[42:16] no way
[42:17] that a person can be a christian unless
[42:19] there is a paradox that takes place in
[42:21] their life
[42:22] because it takes a supernatural you see
[42:25] a paradox is not something you can you
[42:27] can explain
[42:28] yet it's something that is true and it's
[42:31] something that you believe
[42:32] it's what you can stand on it's a
[42:34] paradox it's just like
[42:36] that of men have for their for for
[42:38] lifetimes have tried to
[42:40] disprove or try to understand how moses
[42:43] and them crossed the
[42:44] red sea it's not that we need to
[42:45] understand it it's to believe it
[42:48] because what god did there he's the same
[42:50] god for our lives right now
[42:52] it's the same god that when it would
[42:54] seem like in our life it's closed off
[42:57] maybe when god was dealing with your
[42:59] life you were backed up against a wall
[43:01] and you didn't know which way to turn
[43:03] and you didn't know where which way do i
[43:04] go
[43:05] which way do i turn but that's when god
[43:07] came on the scene
[43:08] and god made a way it was god by his
[43:11] word that parted and opened the waters
[43:14] you did not know and could not find the
[43:16] way but god
[43:17] rich in mercy he came and revealed that
[43:20] i
[43:21] am the way to lead you
[43:24] god rich in mercy it was god that came
[43:27] to you and me
[43:28] so when we think of this and to
[43:30] recognize this
[43:31] mindedness carnal mind and spiritual
[43:34] mind
[43:35] and you know brother branham would deal
[43:37] with it of how
[43:38] that that paradox would come into a life
[43:41] and when the paradox would come it
[43:44] changes
[43:45] a man's nature or a woman's nature it
[43:48] changes
[43:49] our thinking it changes our ways it
[43:52] changes
[43:52] tendencies there is a new man
[43:56] on the inside that is renewed in the
[43:58] knowledge
[43:59] of jesus christ and brother brown would
[44:02] deal with here you know thinking of it
[44:05] he's
[44:06] he's talking to a parents that they
[44:08] can't understand
[44:09] what's wrong with their son you know
[44:12] because there's been
[44:12] something where the son you know it had
[44:14] promised a young lady or
[44:16] and did something or whatever and he
[44:19] wouldn't he wouldn't go make it right he
[44:20] he just would not ask for forgiveness
[44:22] now the parents are wanting to know
[44:25] what is going on with our son now
[44:27] brother baton goes into it
[44:29] and he lets him know he says now i want
[44:31] you to consider it
[44:32] he said here you are you know the mother
[44:35] was a german
[44:36] the father was an irishman and he deals
[44:38] with the genes
[44:39] that are in the natural genes within
[44:41] that parent there's certain parts of
[44:42] makeup you know
[44:43] the irish high tempered and moody and
[44:45] and this and that ring will call yours
[44:47] out tonight
[44:48] but the german part of it and how that
[44:50] the german part was
[44:51] you know brother bam said you could say
[44:53] hi hey come visit us sometimes
[44:55] he said they just sit there and look at
[44:57] you they just wouldn't even greet you
[44:59] back at all they would just
[45:00] look at you but you notice he goes into
[45:04] and he's helping them to see that the
[45:06] genes no matter how
[45:07] full of the holy ghost you are in your
[45:11] life
[45:11] he says that young man he himself has to
[45:15] be
[45:15] born again now you know the genes itself
[45:18] sometimes you know
[45:19] we like to kind of pride ourselves that
[45:21] our genes are good and there's no doubt
[45:23] there's good qualities in every one of
[45:24] us but to understand that everything
[45:26] that you or i could say
[45:28] man this is a strength about the
[45:29] sanchez's this is a strength about the
[45:31] crescents
[45:32] this is a strength about the cruises if
[45:34] you're not careful
[45:35] your strength will be your downfall
[45:37] because every part of our life
[45:40] must be cemented and under the control
[45:42] of the holy spirit
[45:43] instead of us looking at to elevate it
[45:46] and say well so and so don't have this
[45:48] maybe god put that in you for that to be
[45:50] surrendered that he would go together
[45:52] with the body not stand out
[45:53] but blend together with the body to for
[45:56] god to use
[45:57] to be able to minister through that so
[46:00] you know when we look at this
[46:02] a father and mother father had all of
[46:04] these characteristics you know
[46:06] high-tempered moody and this and that
[46:08] and and mother you know that part of
[46:10] unforgiveness and pardon and brother
[46:12] brown goes back into the family
[46:14] tree and he's able to look there and
[46:16] he's taking them back into their family
[46:18] tree
[46:18] he's letting the mother know this is how
[46:20] your sisters are he lets you know the
[46:22] the man know this is how your brothers
[46:24] are he said but notice he said in you
[46:27] it's different for you talking now to
[46:30] the mother it's different
[46:31] he said you're sweet you're tender
[46:33] you're forgiven he said what is that
[46:35] that's not your natural tree
[46:38] that is the tree of life that is christ
[46:41] that has come in your life you now have
[46:44] been lifted
[46:45] from the tree of life and put into the
[46:47] tree of life
[46:48] or lifted from the tree of your natural
[46:51] genealogy
[46:52] and put into the tree of spiritual
[46:54] genealogy
[46:55] who can do that there's not enough
[46:57] teaching not enough training
[46:59] not enough recitation nothing can do
[47:01] that outside
[47:02] of a paradox a miracle of almighty god
[47:06] coming down and bringing a real birth in
[47:09] that life
[47:11] this young man brother branham would say
[47:13] it like this he said that young man
[47:15] he said he's doing all that he can
[47:19] in his intellects to try to overcome
[47:22] this
[47:22] he's trying to overcome those genes
[47:25] let me put it like this there's
[47:27] tendencies
[47:28] baggage or we could call it the grab bag
[47:31] of life
[47:32] you did not grab and put in your grab
[47:34] bag of life what you wanted to grab from
[47:35] your mom and dad
[47:36] you just got a grab bag and said go it
[47:38] was like you showed up
[47:40] to take your lunch and they said you
[47:41] came down to take sack lunches like when
[47:43] i was teaching school
[47:44] the kids didn't come down and say oh you
[47:46] know i'll take i'll take a bologna in
[47:47] mine another one said no i take peanut
[47:49] butter my nope
[47:50] you came down you got a sack lunch you
[47:52] got what's in that bag they might have
[47:53] ran out of doritos right here and this
[47:55] next guy might have got ruffles the next
[47:56] person over there might have got cheetos
[47:58] all you did was pick up the grab bag
[48:00] of life some of you got certain things
[48:02] some of you got other things
[48:03] and you see at one point in time that
[48:06] the very nature that set within you and
[48:08] i
[48:08] it would dominate and rule in that part
[48:11] of our life but
[48:12] god rich in mercy he comes down and he
[48:15] moves within our life
[48:16] he brings a paradox where it's no longer
[48:19] us in our intellects trying to overcome
[48:22] but it is the sovereign grace of god
[48:24] overcoming through our life
[48:28] does it mean that we are free from
[48:30] battles no it does not at all
[48:32] but it just simply means greater is he
[48:34] that is in us
[48:35] than he that's in the world and god will
[48:38] manifest his overcoming power
[48:40] right through you and i you see what
[48:42] happens then we be commanded
[48:44] in the spiritual way we become geared
[48:47] within that manner
[48:48] our sensitivity is to the lord our
[48:50] desire is to please
[48:52] him so when we we think of this
[48:56] it must be you know god to move down on
[48:58] that child
[48:59] because you know the man uh from what
[49:02] i'm told it's a relative
[49:04] from here you know the man himself he
[49:06] stands there but brother brown of my son
[49:08] he came to the altar he repented brother
[49:11] branham he'd been baptized
[49:12] in the name of jesus christ brother he's
[49:15] identified
[49:16] as a believer brother brahm said all
[49:18] those things are true
[49:19] yes he has taken his position as a
[49:22] believer
[49:22] but he said he needs the baptism of the
[49:25] holy ghost
[49:26] you see the only thing that will be able
[49:29] to override
[49:30] the natural genes because the natural
[49:32] genes are part of the carnal mind
[49:34] the only thing that'll be able to
[49:35] override that is the spiritual mind
[49:38] that comes in through by the new birth
[49:40] then you've got a new rulership
[49:42] on the inside there are things that you
[49:45] normally
[49:46] would have went and did and even now if
[49:48] you sort to
[49:49] go in that that direction the spirit of
[49:52] god is there
[49:53] to catch you and correct you and you
[49:55] know what real maturity is
[49:56] real maturity is not trusting this thing
[49:59] but it is trusting
[50:01] the god who rests on the inside of you
[50:04] to bring you in subjection
[50:09] amen it's like sometimes there can be a
[50:12] tendency
[50:13] within a family to hold grudges but the
[50:15] spirit of god within you oh it doesn't
[50:17] mean that there might not be a time
[50:19] that you know something comes up and
[50:21] there's a test you know for everybody
[50:23] some other party it'll pass right
[50:25] through them pass right
[50:26] by him you know but for you that would
[50:27] be a test but you see
[50:29] god and his grace will move down now if
[50:31] you don't heed to it remember the bible
[50:33] says
[50:33] you can grieve the spirit of god but
[50:36] when you can come back into that place
[50:38] the spirit of god can deal with your
[50:39] life and you move into that place and
[50:41] say lord
[50:42] i don't want any fellowship to be broken
[50:44] between you and i
[50:45] i want to walk in that union in a
[50:47] fellowship then from there
[50:49] you begin to recognize this is a
[50:51] weakness
[50:52] in my life i need to keep that covered
[50:55] by the blood of jesus christ and help me
[50:58] to be sensitive lord because you know
[51:00] why
[51:00] you're going to be tested again and
[51:02] again the new birth did not strip it out
[51:04] of your flesh
[51:05] it just gave a ruling authority on the
[51:07] inside of your soul
[51:09] now notice this here in the scripture
[51:12] y'all have to you don't have to pray for
[51:14] me i had to finally get some cheaters
[51:16] put in my glasses
[51:19] because i really hadn't been able to
[51:20] even you know read things and see things
[51:23] i had done more of
[51:24] without glasses or whatever more you
[51:26] know when you're looking at the medicine
[51:27] bottle like this and
[51:28] so when we look at this here the bible
[51:31] says in verse 7
[51:33] the carnal mind is enmity against god
[51:37] because the carnal mind remember that
[51:39] first nature
[51:41] is a conception between satan and eve
[51:45] it's in reasoning against the word
[51:51] cain he came forward he offered up
[51:55] reasoning
[51:59] clean fruit good fruit but it was
[52:02] offered
[52:03] by reasoning abel came and offered
[52:07] what god had sovereignly revealed
[52:10] to him they both heard the same teaching
[52:13] fruit took us out of the garden
[52:15] but god moved in the place
[52:18] and revealed to abel it was blood that
[52:21] took them out
[52:22] it'll be blood to take you back in did
[52:24] that mean that abel understood it no it
[52:26] does not
[52:27] revelation does not mean that we
[52:28] understand it here but revelation brings
[52:31] faith within our heart but we cannot
[52:33] explain it
[52:33] we know that that is truly the word and
[52:37] will of almighty god
[52:39] enmity notice the carnal mind is enmity
[52:42] against god for it is not subject to the
[52:45] law
[52:46] of god neither indeed can be
[52:49] now look at this word subject this word
[52:52] subject is the word
[52:54] ah in the greek it's called hupathaso
[52:57] and this is where we're dealing with the
[52:59] thought on submission
[53:02] it means to arrange
[53:05] to submit to one's control to subject
[53:08] oneself
[53:09] to submit to one's control to yield to
[53:12] one's admonition
[53:13] or advice to obey or be subject
[53:16] in one in one term it can also be used
[53:19] in a military way and
[53:20] then also in a non-military way and we
[53:23] know also in the scripture
[53:24] god will bring uh the illustration
[53:28] of that of of a bride body of a people
[53:32] who are arranged in an order uh under
[53:35] the headship of the word because we are
[53:37] dressed as
[53:38] soldiers of the cross
[53:41] we've been dressed up with his life
[53:44] inside of you and i
[53:45] so in order to be dressed then there had
[53:47] to be a submission this is where
[53:49] in military it deals with you know to
[53:51] arrange in a military fashion under
[53:53] the command of a leader and our leader
[53:56] is the holy ghost
[53:57] in a non-military use it's a voluntary
[54:00] attitude of giving in cooperating
[54:04] assuming responsibility and carrying
[54:07] a burden now i want to just look at a
[54:09] few places in the scripture that this
[54:11] word is used here of
[54:14] of of of um that of submission or
[54:17] to be subject to the law of god this
[54:20] word subject here
[54:21] in in heb in romans 10 3 the bible says
[54:24] for they being ignorant of god's
[54:27] righteousness
[54:28] and going about to establish their own
[54:30] righteousness
[54:31] have not submitted themselves unto
[54:34] the righteousness of god for christ
[54:38] is the end of the law for righteousness
[54:40] to everyone that believeth now think of
[54:42] this
[54:43] they were recognizing here was god was
[54:45] in christ the bible said
[54:47] reconciling the world to himself now to
[54:50] understand that reconciling
[54:52] god was manifesting himself
[54:55] in reconciliation as he had
[54:59] redeemed that body that he had created
[55:03] that then through the offering of that
[55:05] body he would redeem
[55:07] the rest it was god expressing even when
[55:11] the bible would say you know when we
[55:13] look at it in the book of
[55:15] uh of isaiah 53 and it talks about you
[55:19] know
[55:19] the expression of the messiah the report
[55:22] that would be expressed
[55:23] and in the life and ministry of the lord
[55:25] jesus the bible would say
[55:27] that how that he himself he bore our
[55:30] infirmities
[55:30] he took our sicknesses he came among
[55:32] those who were sick those who were devil
[55:35] possessed
[55:35] he came among those who were so mixed up
[55:37] in their marriages
[55:38] and here he came the son of man he came
[55:42] and he dealt with the real issue
[55:45] and the real situation in their life he
[55:47] did not come to pat him on the back and
[55:49] tell him oh what a horrible condition
[55:51] you're in
[55:51] oh this is just terrible no he come to
[55:54] do something about it
[55:55] he come to set him free those who were
[55:57] bound with an infirmity
[55:59] it didn't matter on what the scale if it
[56:00] was how great the infirmity maybe
[56:03] somebody had died
[56:04] or how small the infirmity even
[56:06] sometimes where you take the land
[56:07] at the pool of bethesda brother braham
[56:09] said his infirmity would not have killed
[56:11] him
[56:12] it just goes to show you and i that no
[56:14] matter what you and i might think like
[56:16] well i got a toothache you know
[56:17] i i really couldn't ask prayer why not
[56:20] even if you got a hangnail you can go to
[56:22] god in prayer about it
[56:23] god cares god even took in this hour a
[56:26] little
[56:27] fishy it wasn't a great big bass that
[56:29] would have won tournaments
[56:30] god took a little fishing something that
[56:32] anybody else would have said oh well
[56:34] it's just a fish but god did that for
[56:36] you and i
[56:37] that you and i might see that god takes
[56:40] interest
[56:41] in things that you and i would seem so
[56:43] small but we need a great big god to
[56:45] come on the scene
[56:47] and god would do that for you and i now
[56:49] hear
[56:50] god was manifested to that within israel
[56:53] but remember israel now notice when this
[56:55] manifestation came
[56:57] the woman at the well she said i know
[57:00] that thou art messiah's
[57:01] which is to come now the same expression
[57:06] to the religious in that day said your
[57:09] bill's above
[57:11] expression same expression same message
[57:16] same expression well what was the
[57:19] difference
[57:20] it depended what was on the inside
[57:26] glory be to god so when this expression
[57:30] was expressed to them through
[57:33] the life through god as he come down
[57:36] in the temple of his humanity they
[57:38] themselves seeing the righteousness of
[57:40] god
[57:41] what is the righteousness of god them
[57:43] pharisees were some righteous people
[57:45] but the righteousness of god is god's
[57:48] own word
[57:49] his life being fulfilled
[57:53] oh glory be to god oh glory be to god
[57:56] ephesians 5 21 let's look at another a
[57:59] few other places here
[58:01] in the bible it says submitting same
[58:03] word
[58:04] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[58:07] god
[58:08] this is a paradox too among a local body
[58:11] of believers
[58:14] submitting yourselves to one another in
[58:16] the fear of god
[58:18] brother brown would take this scripture
[58:19] when there was a desire you know to
[58:21] build a new
[58:22] church and brother brown you know would
[58:24] uh you know come along with that brother
[58:25] braham seeing the need
[58:26] it would be the best thing to do was to
[58:28] build a new church but then you know the
[58:30] people themselves did not want to build
[58:31] a new curtain a new new church
[58:33] so brother bam takes the scripture and
[58:34] what did he do he says well if that's
[58:36] how the church is voting we're just
[58:37] going to remodel this building
[58:39] then we'll just stand with that right
[58:40] there submitting ourselves to one
[58:42] another in the fear of god now brother
[58:44] branham could have drawn himself
[58:45] off and got you know pounded and man
[58:47] things aren't going my way and
[58:48] man they need to be going this way and
[58:50] they need to be going this way what kind
[58:52] of example would that be for you and i
[58:54] but you see in order for this to come
[58:55] about remember
[58:57] in times of peace it really doesn't
[58:59] require
[59:00] all the fruits of a statue of perfect
[59:02] man but then fruits are
[59:04] born and manifest in times of adversity
[59:08] it's easy to be long-suffering when you
[59:10] don't need to be right it's easy to be
[59:12] that
[59:13] but you see when long-suffering or
[59:15] forgive even as god
[59:17] for christ's sake has forgiven you amen
[59:19] well you know what's going to require
[59:20] in order for that to be made manifest in
[59:22] our life it's going to require
[59:24] us to come into a situation that we're
[59:26] going to have to do that
[59:28] oh jesus i am signing up for that
[59:30] tonight but submitting yourselves one to
[59:33] another
[59:33] in the fear of god notice not the fear
[59:36] or reverence of one another
[59:38] this is in the fear of god that's the
[59:40] real issue
[59:41] with not only the nation among the
[59:43] churches right in message churches on
[59:45] and on
[59:46] is what is it it's a lack of the fear of
[59:49] god
[59:50] oh brother samuel we need to preach more
[59:53] we need no it's a sign
[59:54] that the presence of god is lifting
[59:59] it's a sign that the presence of god is
[1:00:02] lifting
[1:00:02] but i don't know how about you lord i i
[1:00:04] want to invite it
[1:00:06] i want to invite it i want to walk in
[1:00:07] real reverence to the word of god
[1:00:09] whether nobody when anybody sees me even
[1:00:12] sitting right here you realize to be
[1:00:14] reverence god a person can sit right
[1:00:16] here in body form
[1:00:18] and yet within their spirit they're
[1:00:20] attacking everything that's going on
[1:00:23] this is where submitting ourselves unto
[1:00:25] one another
[1:00:26] in the fear of almighty god now
[1:00:29] ephesians 5
[1:00:30] 22 here here is the the scripture the
[1:00:33] same word used again
[1:00:34] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[1:00:37] husbands
[1:00:38] as unto the lord for the husband
[1:00:42] is the head of the wife even as christ
[1:00:44] is the head of the church
[1:00:45] and he is the savior of the body
[1:00:49] therefore as the church is subject same
[1:00:51] word
[1:00:52] unto christ so let the wives be to their
[1:00:54] own husbands in
[1:00:56] every thing now paul goes on i'm not
[1:01:00] going to read all this the rest of this
[1:01:01] chapter
[1:01:02] but paul would go into this in the
[1:01:04] chapter and he deals with
[1:01:06] what the what what we just read right
[1:01:08] here be subject this is not something to
[1:01:10] say
[1:01:11] will you be subject to me no that's not
[1:01:12] what it is remember the definition is
[1:01:15] is a voluntary attitude one who gives in
[1:01:18] to cooperate
[1:01:19] in other words if we can say it like
[1:01:21] this it's not two visions
[1:01:23] not two kid not two chefs in the kitchen
[1:01:26] it's one recipe we're following
[1:01:28] it's one vision we're under it's one
[1:01:30] power we're being moved by
[1:01:32] one mind one accord it's to come into
[1:01:34] that
[1:01:35] harmony that's a great achievement man
[1:01:37] can never bring that kind of achievement
[1:01:39] but it takes god to bring that
[1:01:41] achievement and god bringing that
[1:01:42] achievement
[1:01:43] is god moving upon our lives and drawing
[1:01:45] us under that vision
[1:01:47] of his word oh man
[1:01:50] oh god help us so notice now the
[1:01:52] scripture says how
[1:01:53] it goes on talks about the expression
[1:01:56] without me reading it
[1:01:57] it deals with how that the husbands
[1:01:59] ought to love see
[1:02:00] in order for subjection to come to that
[1:02:03] of a husband where it says
[1:02:04] wives be subject to your own husbands
[1:02:06] and everything first of all
[1:02:07] they've got to see the representation
[1:02:10] and know that that's my husband
[1:02:12] and they also have to see the attributes
[1:02:14] of husband displayed
[1:02:16] how can you subject yourself to one
[1:02:18] who's not being on display
[1:02:21] are you with me so now the
[1:02:23] responsibility if this is what god is
[1:02:25] requiring
[1:02:26] the only thing that can draw out a wife
[1:02:28] not a woman
[1:02:29] but a wife the only thing that will draw
[1:02:31] out a wife is the manifestation of the
[1:02:33] husband
[1:02:35] is that right it's where you know uh as
[1:02:38] the husband himself
[1:02:39] and you know through the courting
[1:02:40] process and then it moves from the
[1:02:42] corning to where
[1:02:43] the heart begins knitted becomes knitted
[1:02:45] in one in the engagement
[1:02:47] and then it leads right into the
[1:02:49] marriage ceremony but all of that
[1:02:51] is a is is a reality where the husband
[1:02:53] himself
[1:02:54] is is manifesting himself or
[1:02:58] the man is revealing himself in that
[1:03:00] manner his intentions and
[1:03:02] everything is clear and there is a
[1:03:04] reciprocating go on
[1:03:05] because remember a woman does not go out
[1:03:07] and choose a man
[1:03:10] i mean that that's just not even that's
[1:03:12] not even the way things work
[1:03:14] god chose his bride before the
[1:03:18] foundation of the world
[1:03:21] it was not something that was just was
[1:03:23] done in time
[1:03:24] time is only to manifest the choosing
[1:03:26] that already took place
[1:03:28] but the choosing remember it has to be
[1:03:31] that of his own kind
[1:03:32] of his own kindred when god sent uh when
[1:03:35] abraham sent
[1:03:36] eliezer to get a bride for isaac he told
[1:03:38] him don't you take one
[1:03:40] or hear a wife of these inhabitants of
[1:03:43] this land but i want you to go back to
[1:03:45] my homeland
[1:03:46] i want you to go back to the homeland of
[1:03:47] the holy ghost i want you to go back to
[1:03:50] the homeland
[1:03:50] of the promised word i want you to go
[1:03:52] back there and i want you to get a bribe
[1:03:55] for my son isaac is that right
[1:03:58] it would have to be one of his kindred
[1:04:01] and you see
[1:04:01] though you and i could not see ourselves
[1:04:04] as the bride of jesus christ
[1:04:06] but god knew you and i he knew exactly
[1:04:08] what it would take
[1:04:09] and the angel the lord just as the angel
[1:04:12] of the lord
[1:04:13] led rebecca to the well at the evening
[1:04:15] time
[1:04:16] the same angel of the lord has moved
[1:04:19] upon
[1:04:19] our heart and said it's water time it's
[1:04:21] path to glory time
[1:04:23] it's time to go get water it was moving
[1:04:26] in our heart
[1:04:27] it was a supernatural sounding that was
[1:04:30] calling
[1:04:30] us home
[1:04:36] rebecca went to the well like any other
[1:04:37] day you came to this church like any
[1:04:40] other church
[1:04:43] but something begins to happen what is
[1:04:45] it there was a supernatural sounding
[1:04:47] a voice maybe that you couldn't hear but
[1:04:49] it was calling you
[1:04:52] oh glory be to god you see this is why
[1:04:55] paul would pick it up
[1:04:56] and he would write great is the myth
[1:04:59] this is a great mystery
[1:05:01] of christ in the church because to
[1:05:03] recognize
[1:05:04] the choosing of god upon our life
[1:05:08] we see the types in the scripture joseph
[1:05:11] being a type of christ
[1:05:13] he was rejected of his brother thrown in
[1:05:16] a pit
[1:05:17] but raised up and exalted to the right
[1:05:19] hand no one
[1:05:20] more powerful in the kingdom of egypt
[1:05:23] than joseph
[1:05:24] except for pharaoh himself
[1:05:27] but at a time when he was away from his
[1:05:29] brethren they were still his brethren
[1:05:31] he was away from them but during this
[1:05:33] time that he was away
[1:05:34] this was a time he was also it came to a
[1:05:38] place
[1:05:38] that now he takes a gentile bride and as
[1:05:41] he takes that that gentile blood
[1:05:43] this is a type of where here that the
[1:05:46] jews themselves
[1:05:47] they did not submit to the righteousness
[1:05:49] of god they could not
[1:05:51] understand that expression sure there
[1:05:52] was a remnant
[1:05:54] a small little church that was there we
[1:05:56] read about it even in the book of acts
[1:05:57] and then we see simeon we see anna
[1:05:59] we see the different ones but remember
[1:06:01] for the whole of it
[1:06:02] they rejected them they were blinded for
[1:06:04] our sakes
[1:06:05] that you and i might be brought in but
[1:06:07] we see that the day itself upon the
[1:06:09] gentiles
[1:06:10] is closing we realize we're living in a
[1:06:12] time the handwriting's on the wall
[1:06:14] we are found weighed in the balances and
[1:06:16] wanting it's a time right now where the
[1:06:18] gospel
[1:06:19] is getting ready to turn back to the
[1:06:21] jews where god is finishing up a bright
[1:06:23] body
[1:06:24] you see when you think of it this whole
[1:06:26] mystery here
[1:06:27] the very the very bible itself we know
[1:06:29] that the bible itself being that of the
[1:06:31] book of redemption
[1:06:32] that how that even the scriptures he
[1:06:34] would open with a marriage
[1:06:36] and the bible itself would close with a
[1:06:38] marriage
[1:06:39] it would open with that union between
[1:06:41] adam and his bride
[1:06:43] his bride that came forth from his side
[1:06:46] and we see then in the book of
[1:06:47] revelations where it is closed out
[1:06:50] with the marriage of the bride where it
[1:06:52] would say in revelations 19
[1:06:54] let us be glad and rejoice for the
[1:06:56] marriage of the lamb
[1:06:58] is come it speaks of where that christ
[1:07:01] himself
[1:07:01] has been making up his bride body they
[1:07:04] were always a seed
[1:07:06] a seed of god but it took the spirit of
[1:07:08] god
[1:07:09] to bring us in position in the body
[1:07:12] where we belong hallelujah
[1:07:15] because this age is not the entire body
[1:07:18] this age is a part that comes together
[1:07:21] with the entire body
[1:07:23] is that right oh my there's a
[1:07:25] responsibility
[1:07:26] upon our upon because the bride has been
[1:07:29] made up
[1:07:30] of all down through the ages where god
[1:07:32] has been building but to think of this
[1:07:34] in in this measure this is the really
[1:07:36] where the real
[1:07:37] the real uh a difference is in the
[1:07:40] choosing of god because
[1:07:42] to remember when we look at this of a
[1:07:44] husband and a wife and you think of it
[1:07:46] in terms that the bible says let the
[1:07:48] wife reverence her husband
[1:07:50] well it didn't say reverence an idea
[1:07:54] reverence a thing reverence a creed no
[1:07:57] no no the husband
[1:07:58] is a person the wife
[1:08:01] is a person and that husband and wife
[1:08:05] it speaks of the relationship that's to
[1:08:07] be had
[1:08:08] that relationship that is to be had they
[1:08:11] themselves when that union takes place
[1:08:14] it affects everything is that right
[1:08:17] the bride when the bride you know i know
[1:08:20] this nowadays we got things that's all
[1:08:21] all together different you know but you
[1:08:24] know in this time and age that we're
[1:08:25] living in
[1:08:26] you find that a time to where when when
[1:08:29] a man would ask a woman
[1:08:30] to marry him in proposal and she accepts
[1:08:33] that here they come into engagement
[1:08:34] and here they come into marriage
[1:08:35] ceremony then just like rebecca
[1:08:38] she leads the land of her nativity and
[1:08:41] she comes to dwell
[1:08:42] in the land of his nativity what happens
[1:08:45] there
[1:08:45] is a change of address there is a change
[1:08:49] from where she's dwelling
[1:08:51] she no longer is living at the address
[1:08:54] when the courtship started but all she's
[1:08:56] changed addresses
[1:08:58] and that's the same way it is when the
[1:09:00] holy ghost has come
[1:09:02] when christ has revealed himself as our
[1:09:06] husband
[1:09:06] this word has revealed itself this is my
[1:09:10] maid
[1:09:10] what does it do it brings a change of
[1:09:13] location
[1:09:14] we're in the same flesh but our soul has
[1:09:17] been
[1:09:18] translated from under the power of
[1:09:21] darkness
[1:09:21] into the kingdom of his dear son
[1:09:25] that relationship it what came it was
[1:09:28] revealed
[1:09:29] by the person himself
[1:09:32] our husband oh that's greater than any
[1:09:37] anointing upon a spirit is that right
[1:09:40] brother brahman said there can be an
[1:09:42] emotion an anointing upon the spirit
[1:09:44] but yet that life that soul is still not
[1:09:47] sealed away
[1:09:48] but when that soul has been sealed away
[1:09:50] god's daughter on the inside
[1:09:52] that's when the love of the world it's
[1:09:55] passed away
[1:09:56] and they're walking in the word for
[1:09:59] their day
[1:10:00] not just a good person doing good things
[1:10:03] i don't think anybody in here
[1:10:04] would you know would disagree or would
[1:10:07] say uh you know i don't want nobody
[1:10:09] who's a good moral person
[1:10:10] working next to me on the job no we
[1:10:12] appreciate all that but you recognize
[1:10:14] the righteousness of god is so much
[1:10:16] deeper and so much greater
[1:10:18] than good morality if it would have been
[1:10:20] good morality
[1:10:21] jesus could have stopped and not even
[1:10:23] went to the cross but remember
[1:10:25] righteousness is that where the life of
[1:10:27] god
[1:10:28] righteousness itself comes to fulfill
[1:10:31] the purpose of god
[1:10:33] that's real righteousness so it would
[1:10:35] require
[1:10:36] the wife herself that which is on the
[1:10:38] inside
[1:10:39] to actually catch that expression that
[1:10:42] revealing
[1:10:43] of the husband oh my aren't you glad you
[1:10:46] caught that
[1:10:47] little samuel how did i catch it how did
[1:10:50] i do it
[1:10:50] it wasn't this right it was this down
[1:10:53] here
[1:10:55] it caught it now notice the scripture
[1:10:59] goes on to say in romans 8 8
[1:11:01] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:11:04] cannot please god
[1:11:07] they that are in the flesh my it sounds
[1:11:09] like they're in a prison
[1:11:11] in the flesh and you can look around and
[1:11:13] say well
[1:11:15] i'm still dwelling in flesh but the
[1:11:17] difference is your soul
[1:11:19] has changed locations
[1:11:22] you've been united you see you've got
[1:11:24] removed just you move from the book of
[1:11:26] life
[1:11:26] to the lamb section lord be to god who
[1:11:29] moved you there
[1:11:30] he did he came down and took you unto
[1:11:33] himself
[1:11:33] he came down and began to reel him
[1:11:35] reveal himself not just as your savior
[1:11:38] not just as your lord not just as a
[1:11:40] prophet not just as a good man
[1:11:42] but this word came and revealed to you
[1:11:44] and i
[1:11:45] i am your hisha your husband
[1:11:49] and you are my pride
[1:11:54] you were ordained to bring forth my
[1:11:57] image
[1:11:58] into this earth you are ordained to
[1:12:00] reflect me
[1:12:01] in this generation you ordained i've
[1:12:04] chosen
[1:12:05] your womb that seed on the inside
[1:12:08] to bear my image my life my nature
[1:12:13] in this generation
[1:12:19] we were like that little woman we didn't
[1:12:21] have much
[1:12:23] all the rest of those on the ranch when
[1:12:25] the sun came down
[1:12:26] and to pick out a bride all the rest of
[1:12:28] them had nice fine dresses and
[1:12:30] everything else
[1:12:31] but he came down he didn't see a
[1:12:33] character in any one of those he wanted
[1:12:34] to unite with
[1:12:37] him coming down him
[1:12:40] coming down coming to the ranch
[1:12:44] it didn't change their character
[1:12:48] oh my we could preach right here but him
[1:12:50] coming down in that ranch you know what
[1:12:51] he did
[1:12:52] it revealed the character that was in
[1:12:54] her
[1:12:57] you could look at it and say my why
[1:12:58] aren't the rest of him it's responding
[1:13:01] the way she did
[1:13:02] because it was the foreign nation of god
[1:13:04] in her life
[1:13:06] as far as by looks he could have passed
[1:13:08] her up
[1:13:10] but it was the character what she was
[1:13:13] doing
[1:13:14] when his presence was there
[1:13:18] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:13:20] cannot please god notice
[1:13:21] this this word please it means this word
[1:13:24] please it deals with through the idea
[1:13:27] of like an exciting emotion not
[1:13:29] something that's of
[1:13:30] you know dread or or grudge or
[1:13:33] oh man yeah
[1:13:37] brother samuel saying this and oh my you
[1:13:40] know i don't know why the message says
[1:13:41] this and
[1:13:42] i don't i'll tell you the scripture you
[1:13:43] know i i don't i don't i just think they
[1:13:46] need to get up to date
[1:13:53] it means to strive to please
[1:13:57] to accommodate oneself to the opinions
[1:14:01] desires and interests of another
[1:14:05] see god looks on the heart god just
[1:14:08] don't look at an outward emotion
[1:14:10] an outward emotion can jump run speak in
[1:14:13] tongues
[1:14:14] be religious that's what brother brahma
[1:14:16] says concerning that
[1:14:17] in thinking man's filter but to think
[1:14:19] about it of how
[1:14:20] that when we we look at this we know
[1:14:23] that the word of god
[1:14:24] how god looks deep into our life to
[1:14:27] where he'll look at the very
[1:14:29] motives and objectives of our life just
[1:14:31] just listening to you know how many
[1:14:33] times you listen to
[1:14:34] a message and then all of a sudden
[1:14:35] something just stands out to you brother
[1:14:37] tells us in the message desperation
[1:14:39] how that hannah was there in you know in
[1:14:41] in the temple
[1:14:42] and she was crying out she wanted a
[1:14:44] child she was asking god
[1:14:46] for a child brother brahman said you
[1:14:48] know he said god heard the desperation
[1:14:51] that was within hannah he saw within
[1:14:54] hannah that there was
[1:14:56] a desire in her life that was not
[1:14:58] selfish
[1:14:59] it was an unselfish desire he said so
[1:15:02] god
[1:15:03] just didn't give her a child he just
[1:15:05] didn't give her a son
[1:15:06] he gave her a prophet all glory you see
[1:15:10] god knew the desire that would be in our
[1:15:12] life brother
[1:15:13] god just didn't call us to a church but
[1:15:16] god gave us a prophet
[1:15:17] god gave us the holy ghost the spirit of
[1:15:21] truth
[1:15:21] because he knew what caliber of seed
[1:15:24] was down there on the inside not a sea
[1:15:27] that would move in church
[1:15:29] and live a different life on the outside
[1:15:31] but he knew there was seed down here
[1:15:34] there are seed that's just like my kind
[1:15:37] and when i can move to that place in
[1:15:39] their life
[1:15:40] they will reflect by nature
[1:15:44] it'll be a paradox from carnal minded to
[1:15:46] spiritual man
[1:15:51] to accommodate ourselves to one interest
[1:15:54] you know
[1:15:55] the bible says you're familiar with the
[1:15:58] scripture
[1:16:00] where it lets us know it's impossible
[1:16:07] it's impossible to please god without
[1:16:08] faith
[1:16:10] let me just let me just drop drop drop
[1:16:12] this in here
[1:16:15] your journey faith itself
[1:16:20] there's got to be a starting point
[1:16:24] the bible says it's by grace through
[1:16:26] faith
[1:16:28] you see you always had faith
[1:16:31] you had faith when you go out and start
[1:16:34] your car and it works by faith
[1:16:36] but you see your faith it had to be
[1:16:39] moved
[1:16:40] in that of a living god there's only one
[1:16:43] could do that
[1:16:44] and that was him so it was grace
[1:16:48] grace that was issued to you and i grace
[1:16:51] that would come
[1:16:53] to be able to cause our faith to rise
[1:16:56] even in repentance it was it was a
[1:16:59] journey
[1:17:00] of faith so i want you to understand
[1:17:02] this that it all begins in that journey
[1:17:04] where a person would start on a journey
[1:17:07] and you know you can look at that
[1:17:08] scripture and say
[1:17:09] well those that are in the the karma in
[1:17:11] the flesh they cannot please god
[1:17:13] but you see when a person is walking by
[1:17:16] faith and they're walking in all the
[1:17:18] light that god
[1:17:19] has revealed to them and all that god is
[1:17:22] opening and showing
[1:17:23] then they are pleasing god with the
[1:17:26] purpose
[1:17:26] that their faith itself would come to a
[1:17:29] place
[1:17:30] to where god would seal that faith or
[1:17:32] recognize that faith
[1:17:34] as he did abraham's faith and that seal
[1:17:37] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:39] what paul was dealing with right here
[1:17:41] that while a person is in their flesh
[1:17:43] a person can try you know doing
[1:17:45] everything they can or when i say
[1:17:47] everything they can
[1:17:48] they're they're they're trying to do
[1:17:49] everything in their own
[1:17:51] abilities in their own way it's like
[1:17:53] that young man that brother man talked
[1:17:54] about bill graham said he's trying his
[1:17:56] best in his intellect
[1:17:57] he'll never ever be able to overcome it
[1:18:00] it'll take
[1:18:01] christ coming into him when he
[1:18:03] surrenders
[1:18:04] and he says this i love this he said
[1:18:06] when he surrenders he's already overcome
[1:18:08] then
[1:18:10] the surrender is where overcoming takes
[1:18:12] place it's the same thing it was in the
[1:18:14] garden of gethsemane
[1:18:15] now notice this here in journey
[1:18:19] in verse 9 but ye are not in the flesh
[1:18:23] but in the spirit oh my if so be
[1:18:28] that the spirit of god dwell in you
[1:18:32] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:18:34] christ
[1:18:35] he is none of his
[1:18:39] oh my we've been you've been caught away
[1:18:42] still walking in this same
[1:18:44] flesh body but you've been caught away
[1:18:48] you've already experienced a
[1:18:50] resurrection
[1:18:52] you've already experienced a rapture
[1:18:55] we're waiting for the rapture that
[1:18:57] that's sweeping down for the very change
[1:18:59] of our body but there's already been a
[1:19:01] catching away
[1:19:02] the earnest has already come to your
[1:19:05] life
[1:19:06] the earnest is the down payment that
[1:19:08] there's more to come
[1:19:12] so you're no longer in the flesh but he
[1:19:15] says
[1:19:15] you're in the spirit it is it is so be
[1:19:19] that the spirit of god dwell in you and
[1:19:21] if any man have not the spirit of christ
[1:19:22] he is none of his so it's no longer
[1:19:26] us it's no longer us brother brown would
[1:19:29] would continue to place this throughout
[1:19:30] the message
[1:19:31] he said it's not us when we've received
[1:19:34] the holy ghost
[1:19:35] it's not us controlling the holy ghost
[1:19:37] but now it is the holy ghost controlling
[1:19:39] us
[1:19:40] it's not us leading god but it's god
[1:19:43] leading us you know so many times some
[1:19:46] people tell
[1:19:46] to god lord this is what i want but god
[1:19:49] remember
[1:19:50] god will not override self-will you see
[1:19:53] a person can come
[1:19:54] and ask you know they say i need bread
[1:19:57] but are they willing to ask
[1:19:58] are they willing to say you know what
[1:20:00] the truth is i don't got no bread
[1:20:02] and i really need bread you know what
[1:20:03] that requires that requires humble pie
[1:20:05] i you know what i ain't got no bread i
[1:20:07] need some bread uh i could could you
[1:20:09] give me a piece of bread
[1:20:10] instead of just saying you know what hey
[1:20:11] i need bread but it requires humility
[1:20:14] when you have to actually express
[1:20:16] what you lack and this is what i need
[1:20:18] god wants
[1:20:19] honesty he wants integrity god wants
[1:20:23] genuine confession and repentance
[1:20:27] i tell you what god will not stay away
[1:20:29] from repentance
[1:20:32] there was a man by the name of ahab that
[1:20:34] god already pronounced judgment on his
[1:20:36] house
[1:20:37] and that guy got down and repented and
[1:20:39] put sackcloth and ashes and god said you
[1:20:41] know what
[1:20:41] because you've done this i went you
[1:20:43] won't see it fulfilled in your
[1:20:44] generation but it will take place
[1:20:46] afterwards
[1:20:48] repentance moves the heart of god
[1:20:52] now i want you to look at this here
[1:20:53] let's try to you know try to bring this
[1:20:55] down
[1:20:56] in philippians chapter 2 verse 5 this is
[1:20:58] where paul would write
[1:20:59] let this mind be in you which was
[1:21:02] also in christ jesus
[1:21:06] who being in the form of god
[1:21:09] thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:21:12] with god but made himself
[1:21:16] of no reputation and took upon him the
[1:21:19] form
[1:21:20] of a servant and was made in the
[1:21:23] likeness
[1:21:23] of men and being found in fashion as a
[1:21:27] man
[1:21:27] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:21:30] unto death
[1:21:31] even the death of the cross
[1:21:38] oh my god think of this
[1:21:42] how that the mercy of god
[1:21:45] that god would bring this mind into you
[1:21:48] and i it's not our natural mind
[1:21:50] it's not a natural mind he's talking
[1:21:52] about but we needed
[1:21:54] a different mind we need it as the
[1:21:57] scriptures would write
[1:21:58] a renewing of our mind
[1:22:02] paul would write clearly we were
[1:22:04] alienated
[1:22:06] from the presence of god by wicked works
[1:22:10] in our mind he's speaking
[1:22:13] of that nature of that soul
[1:22:17] so the request or the invitation would
[1:22:19] be
[1:22:20] let this mind which was in christ
[1:22:24] be in you also
[1:22:27] who thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:22:30] with god he was in
[1:22:31] the form of god but he took upon the
[1:22:33] form of a servant look
[1:22:34] what humility
[1:22:38] was manifested in this
[1:22:41] mind so contrary
[1:22:45] to the carnal mind right the carnal mind
[1:22:49] in that hour had the messiah coming
[1:22:53] down golden staircase
[1:22:58] all the trees are going to clap their
[1:22:59] hands
[1:23:01] the hills will skip they had their ideas
[1:23:04] that was scripture
[1:23:05] they had their ideas
[1:23:09] but you see god did it in such a simple
[1:23:13] way that it bypassed
[1:23:16] all the intellect of man
[1:23:20] it went right over the smart people's
[1:23:22] heads it went over the people's heads
[1:23:25] that could read they could pronounce
[1:23:26] everything just right it went right over
[1:23:28] their heads
[1:23:30] and it came right into a man's heart
[1:23:32] that couldn't even read his name
[1:23:34] if it was wrote on a boxcar amen
[1:23:40] came to peter came to andrew came to
[1:23:42] different ones
[1:23:44] let's stop here it moved upon
[1:23:48] their lives i tell you when this
[1:23:50] spiritual mind has moved into a life
[1:23:54] the contrast when we look at even jacob
[1:23:56] and esau
[1:23:57] great contrast between them esau was a
[1:24:00] good good man
[1:24:02] oh he was a good guy helped his daddy
[1:24:05] you know went and got venison for him
[1:24:07] you know if we could say it wiped his
[1:24:08] mouth you know when a little bit of
[1:24:10] venison grease was
[1:24:11] coming around he was a good good guy
[1:24:15] jacob was a shyster
[1:24:18] down beneath all of that on the inside
[1:24:23] beneath all them business deals beneath
[1:24:26] all the rest of that
[1:24:28] there was a real prince of god
[1:24:32] now he heard he heard you know his daddy
[1:24:34] talk about all the promises
[1:24:36] but you see there was something that his
[1:24:38] daddy did not put within him
[1:24:41] even though esau was the first one to
[1:24:44] come out of the womb
[1:24:45] he was the firstborn he was the one to
[1:24:48] whom
[1:24:49] all of the covenants and all the
[1:24:50] blessing the first blessing was to
[1:24:52] it was to esau so you would look at with
[1:24:56] jacob and you would say jacob
[1:24:58] why is your life wrapped in wanting to
[1:25:00] get that birthright
[1:25:02] do you know you ain't got a fighting
[1:25:04] chance esau was born before you
[1:25:07] why is this why is that the only thing
[1:25:08] you can talk about
[1:25:10] you see i understand maybe for some you
[1:25:13] didn't you wasn't that you were talking
[1:25:14] about
[1:25:14] a birthright but there was something in
[1:25:16] your heart
[1:25:18] there's got to be a god somewhere
[1:25:21] there's a truth there's got to be truth
[1:25:23] somewhere
[1:25:25] you've seen a lot of things you said
[1:25:26] brother samuel what was that the
[1:25:28] foreknowledge
[1:25:28] of god taking place
[1:25:32] it was taking place you may not have
[1:25:34] known the the the
[1:25:36] holy ghost you know and heard even terms
[1:25:40] let alone new bible stories but god
[1:25:42] didn't call you because you knew bible
[1:25:44] stories
[1:25:45] god didn't call you because you had all
[1:25:47] the stickers on the sunday school chart
[1:25:51] that is not what god that's not why god
[1:25:53] calls you and i
[1:25:55] but god calls us that what he did
[1:25:57] through jonah what he did through moses
[1:26:00] what he did through joseph what he did
[1:26:01] through rahab what he did through ruth
[1:26:03] that same christ he comes to manifest
[1:26:07] that same living reality through you and
[1:26:10] i
[1:26:11] who am i who am i a life
[1:26:14] that would submit to him
[1:26:20] where he would say will you
[1:26:25] will you be my wife will you be my bride
[1:26:30] i've been watching you for a long time
[1:26:32] lord i've only been walking here on this
[1:26:34] earth for 33 years
[1:26:36] yeah but i've known you before
[1:26:39] time you were in my mind
[1:26:44] as a matter of fact when i thought of
[1:26:46] becoming tangible
[1:26:47] that's when i thought of you i've longed
[1:26:52] for this day to come that i might
[1:26:55] express and reveal myself to you
[1:26:58] you see you did not know that you were
[1:27:00] ordained to be my bride
[1:27:02] you did not know that you ordained to be
[1:27:05] my wife
[1:27:06] but i knew you i never lost sight of you
[1:27:09] i knew nothing could get you out of my
[1:27:11] sight
[1:27:12] but i came to you and i brought you
[1:27:27] what could you say about god's mind he's
[1:27:30] determined
[1:27:32] i said he's determined he didn't let
[1:27:35] nothing stand in his way
[1:27:38] the fall came in eden is that i'll give
[1:27:40] you a seat
[1:27:42] i'll make a way back here came noah god
[1:27:46] of drunk
[1:27:47] god said i'm still coming for you
[1:27:51] glory be to god there is nothing you see
[1:27:54] what it was
[1:27:55] when you look at that these god never
[1:27:57] allowed
[1:27:58] any of that any of the faults and
[1:28:00] failures and mistakes
[1:28:02] of man to hinder his program or his plan
[1:28:05] but god said in the midst of that i will
[1:28:08] show
[1:28:09] my glory
[1:28:12] i have always loved you i chose you
[1:28:16] before creation
[1:28:17] and i come to bring you to myself
[1:28:20] you've always wondered who you were
[1:28:22] wondered why you didn't fit in
[1:28:24] wondered why things were strange wonder
[1:28:26] why you couldn't go
[1:28:27] anywhere else it's because of the four
[1:28:31] nation my choosing of your life you were
[1:28:34] always a son
[1:28:35] and daughter of god
[1:28:40] but you see the only way you'll know who
[1:28:42] you are it takes one of your kind to let
[1:28:44] you know
[1:28:46] an eagle looking at a chicken don't make
[1:28:48] an eagle
[1:28:50] but when an eagle sees an eagle
[1:28:52] something just rises up
[1:29:02] if god was minded like that before i
[1:29:05] believe he's minded like that tonight
[1:29:09] and i believe every son and daughter of
[1:29:10] god spiritually minded been born of the
[1:29:12] spirit of god
[1:29:13] even if god's dealing on your life right
[1:29:15] now i want you to understand this
[1:29:17] in this capacity it's god's
[1:29:19] determination
[1:29:20] at work in your life
[1:29:24] he said i've got you in the palm of my
[1:29:26] hands no man
[1:29:28] can pluck you out
[1:29:31] you love him tonight let's stand
[1:29:36] together
[1:29:41] oh hallelujah let's pray together
[1:29:46] heavenly father
[1:29:49] lord jesus sometimes lord
[1:29:52] we come into these places and
[1:29:55] lord thank you just doesn't seem
[1:30:01] seem like enough
[1:30:04] but i'm reminded lord that there was ten
[1:30:07] lepers
[1:30:09] nine of them went ahead and went on
[1:30:13] lord i know they were they were excited
[1:30:15] they were thankful they never
[1:30:16] they never had to be without the camp or
[1:30:20] without
[1:30:21] the city they could go back to their
[1:30:23] families go back to different
[1:30:25] but there was one oh he was rejoicing
[1:30:30] but he turned back and he came bowing
[1:30:34] and worshipped
[1:30:35] and he said thank you
[1:30:39] what i know this isn't thanksgiving day
[1:30:41] on the calendar
[1:30:43] but really every day is
[1:30:47] to thanksgiving real believer we are so
[1:30:49] thankful lord
[1:30:50] so thankful for what you've done
[1:30:54] for us lord in our lives
[1:30:58] or the strength that you've placed
[1:31:00] within us
[1:31:02] the lord wherein that we at one time
[1:31:04] walked
[1:31:06] with that of a carnal mind the lord god
[1:31:10] the grace of god has moved down lifted
[1:31:13] us
[1:31:14] from the bondage of the carnal mind
[1:31:18] lord to be moved by that same mind that
[1:31:20] was in christ jesus
[1:31:22] to be spiritual minded as sons and
[1:31:25] daughters of god
[1:31:27] lord just as you were minded
[1:31:31] determined to bring this redemption
[1:31:35] to us i believe dear god that that same
[1:31:38] life moving within us
[1:31:40] it brings that same determination or
[1:31:44] as your prophet would put it desperation
[1:31:48] dear god we're no longer walking after
[1:31:51] the flesh
[1:31:53] walking after the spirit
[1:31:57] lord i pray tonight you know where each
[1:32:00] and every one of us are at
[1:32:03] the lord i ask dear god that as you have
[1:32:06] come lord and minister to our hearts
[1:32:09] your god truly when there's a heart that
[1:32:12] desires
[1:32:13] to move into that realm they could not
[1:32:16] have that desire first of all
[1:32:18] if you didn't put it in them and for
[1:32:21] them to be able to ask for it
[1:32:23] you would express that they've heard
[1:32:25] from you
[1:32:26] now lord when a person has heard from
[1:32:28] you then they can get desperate because
[1:32:31] they know
[1:32:32] that you've spoken personally to their
[1:32:33] hearts
[1:32:35] the lord i ask tonight dear god i know
[1:32:38] that i
[1:32:39] we speak there's those lord that's in
[1:32:41] journey
