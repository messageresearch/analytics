[0:00] get my finger in it you know or a
[0:01] different thing but all of that together
[0:04] goes to make that cake there's
[0:07] experiences in every one of our life
[0:09] there's some experiences
[0:10] where we made the wrong decision but yet
[0:13] by god's grace if we can say
[0:15] lord teach me lord god does not come
[0:18] and put us down but he'll come and he'll
[0:21] instruct us
[0:22] to now what the enemy thought oh my
[0:25] i'll just enshroud their life but
[0:27] instead it becomes
[0:28] a teaching and a principle and serves as
[0:32] discernment
[0:32] i believe we're here to learn from those
[0:34] things brother branham would stand in
[0:36] the life story over and over again and
[0:38] he would say
[0:39] i trust he said that you're able to take
[0:42] my mistakes
[0:43] as stepping stones of god's grace for
[0:45] your life
[0:46] and brethren would take us into joshua
[0:48] and moses and he would say
[0:50] joshua learned from moses mistakes
[0:53] he never sent a bunch of men but he only
[0:56] sent two
[0:58] see it's a growing maturity is growing
[1:02] it's learning it comes to a place to
[1:05] where it's no longer the same
[1:07] maybe the same mistakes that are being
[1:09] made we're never going to be perfect
[1:11] but we begin to recognize when things
[1:13] arise and we can recognize our weakness
[1:16] because our weakness it isn't ever going
[1:18] to be to a good
[1:19] that weakness is gone in your life but
[1:21] where you rule over it
[1:24] you keep it covered with the blood of
[1:26] jesus christ and that weakness part of
[1:28] it you have nothing to prove to the
[1:30] enemy
[1:31] except submit yourself unto god the
[1:33] bible said
[1:34] submit yourself unto god and then resist
[1:37] the devil
[1:38] and he will flee from you
[1:41] now well we just keep going here i don't
[1:45] know where all that
[1:47] but we just keep going now let's look
[1:49] here
[1:50] in this of ephesians 5 verse 21 and i
[1:52] want to continue to look at this
[1:54] honor in the home and we'll just see how
[1:56] the lord will help us here tonight
[1:59] in ephesians 5 21 submitting yourselves
[2:03] one to another in the fear of god and i
[2:05] want you to keep that word submitting
[2:07] here for just a little bit submitting
[2:09] yourselves one to another
[2:11] in the fear of god notice in the fear
[2:14] of god it's not even
[2:18] dealing with whether the person is
[2:20] worthy or not
[2:23] are you catching me in the fear of god
[2:27] so where is our submission based
[2:30] in the fear of god
[2:32] [Music]
[2:34] you see this is why brother branham
[2:35] would say if you can't respect the man
[2:37] you respect the office
[2:39] that he holds you see bill abrams says
[2:42] now
[2:43] he goes he quotes the scripture the fear
[2:45] of god is the beginning of wisdom
[2:47] now that don't mean that you're afraid
[2:48] of him
[2:50] that means you are giving him respects
[2:52] and reverence he's talking about god
[2:56] and when you respect god you fear god
[3:00] so brother brahms tying this together
[3:01] respect and fear because this is when
[3:04] fear is spoken of remember the fear of
[3:06] the lord is
[3:07] clean it's clean it's not a slavish
[3:11] or a tormenting thing that's not the
[3:13] fear of god
[3:15] the fear of god is a reverence and a
[3:18] respect
[3:21] so notice you fear that you might
[3:24] displease
[3:25] him in some way you fear lest you would
[3:28] do something wrong
[3:29] you wouldn't want to do it so that fear
[3:32] or that reverence
[3:34] is driven by love
[3:37] you love him therefore you have no
[3:39] desire to do wrong that's been removed
[3:42] from
[3:42] from your life your desire is to please
[3:45] him
[3:47] it's just like when if you if your day
[3:49] has become so busy with things and
[3:51] sometimes
[3:52] your best laid plans your day can become
[3:55] so
[3:55] busy with things and before you know it
[3:57] you think where did the day go
[4:00] what i had planned to do this and plan
[4:02] to do this and
[4:03] you know sometimes how the day will go
[4:05] and and you and you look within that and
[4:07] you think
[4:08] lord i i haven't even really had the
[4:10] time to really
[4:11] to speak to you and be just like you've
[4:13] just walked by and
[4:14] maybe you've just ignored him and not
[4:17] that you've done it
[4:18] intentionally but you come back into
[4:20] those places and look
[4:22] when we come back into those places
[4:24] don't let the devil beat you up on that
[4:26] just come back into it and recognize say
[4:28] you know what paul
[4:29] said pray without ceasing
[4:33] i know target may not be well for some
[4:35] of you target may not be the ideal place
[4:37] to pray in walmart and whatever more but
[4:40] you can pray wherever you're at
[4:44] you can pray wherever you're at pray
[4:47] without ceasing it just had things
[4:50] as things just coming on your heart
[4:51] meditation is part of prayer
[4:54] it's part of keeping and just meditating
[4:57] and
[4:58] and you know as you meditate on him he
[4:59] draws an eye his presence begins to come
[5:02] and
[5:03] just to draw nice so so don't allow the
[5:05] enemy to just
[5:06] isolate and make prayer some stale
[5:08] formal traditional thing no
[5:10] prayer it's just like you can talk to
[5:13] your spouse
[5:14] it don't matter if you're on the patio
[5:15] don't matter if you're in
[5:17] in the living room it don't matter if
[5:19] you're in the kitchen it don't matter if
[5:20] you're in the garage
[5:21] are you with me at times that my wife
[5:24] has come out and talked to me and i've
[5:25] been out there in the landscaping and i
[5:26] have
[5:27] dirt all over i've got grease all over
[5:29] my hands and
[5:30] i'll tease and say honey give me a hug
[5:32] and i've got grease all over my hands
[5:33] but it don't matter she can she'll come
[5:35] and talk to me out there sometimes i'll
[5:37] tell her hey i want you
[5:38] can i get you a chair out here and
[5:39] here's the shade let's just sit right
[5:41] here just talk to me
[5:42] well i'm out here but you see it doesn't
[5:45] matter
[5:46] where you're at you can always talk to
[5:48] the lord
[5:51] he loves to hear from you he loves to
[5:54] hear your voice in the song of solomon
[5:56] chapter 2 verse 14 he says my dove
[6:00] for sweet is thy voice
[6:04] he loves to hear from you and i as his
[6:07] children
[6:08] so don't let the enemy beat you up on
[6:09] that just allow god said god
[6:11] teach me let me make every point in
[6:13] value of my day
[6:15] amen oh my as long as brother bram says
[6:19] i fear my mother i fear my wife i fear
[6:22] my church i fear all of god's servants
[6:26] unless i should put a stumbling block
[6:29] somewhere in their way i fear the people
[6:33] i fear the people of the city unless i
[6:35] should do something wrong
[6:37] that would cause them to think that i
[6:39] wasn't a christian
[6:40] notice where the what this fear or
[6:42] respect is about
[6:44] it's not about him it's about others
[6:48] i i fear my wife i fear the church
[6:52] i respect take the word respect the fear
[6:54] is too much
[6:55] take the word respect that's what this
[6:57] word fear means he respects him so much
[7:00] that
[7:00] i don't want to do anything that would
[7:02] cause them to stumble
[7:04] i don't want to do anything that would
[7:06] cause them to think
[7:07] that i'm not a christian i want to
[7:10] but let's take the contrast to this
[7:12] rather i want to respect them in such a
[7:14] way
[7:15] that i want the desires that they would
[7:17] see jesus christ and that god would help
[7:20] me to be
[7:20] sensitive to know where there's a need
[7:22] going on where
[7:23] something needs maybe to a word of
[7:25] encouragement or
[7:26] something that maybe is being done and
[7:28] just say you know what this
[7:30] stops right here because why it's
[7:32] troubling
[7:35] it might be troubling that person or
[7:36] that individual or troubling a situation
[7:40] is that right
[7:44] i mean paul spoke of these things even
[7:46] when he we and we covered this sometime
[7:48] where paul was talking about member he
[7:49] says is if meat makes my brother to
[7:52] offend
[7:53] then i will not eat meat as long as the
[7:55] world stands who is that about that was
[7:58] about the other brother
[8:00] you see once once the love of god has
[8:02] come into our life
[8:04] it delivers us from the selfishness of
[8:07] the first birth
[8:10] but we've got to battle every day
[8:13] are you with me we've got a battle every
[8:15] day that's why we have to take up our
[8:17] cross
[8:18] daily and crucify the flesh
[8:23] because new life has come in now there
[8:25] is a war
[8:26] now there's a contrast now there there
[8:29] is opposition
[8:31] but greater is he that's in you and to
[8:34] remember he that is in us has already
[8:37] overcome that thing
[8:40] amen so brother baby says you before you
[8:44] can have respect you've got to have fear
[8:46] and god he demands it he demands respect
[8:49] god does he demands it and fear brings
[8:51] it and we know that fear brings respect
[8:54] so in ephesians 5 22
[8:57] wives submit yourselves unto your
[9:00] own husbands as unto the lord now notice
[9:03] how the pattern is going submitting the
[9:06] very first verse we read submitting
[9:08] yourselves
[9:08] to one another in the fear of the lord
[9:12] respect right
[9:16] no doubt through this room here there
[9:18] are there is some that we could say
[9:20] you know what i had respect my respect
[9:22] the boss for the office they hold but as
[9:24] far as the person
[9:26] there's nothing wrong with that but to
[9:28] have the respect remember when paul
[9:31] we we taught on the servants and masters
[9:33] and paul said do
[9:34] as doing it unto the lord
[9:37] paul said if you want help saying i
[9:40] don't know from this person if i can't
[9:41] paul said then put it like this put the
[9:44] face of jesus on him
[9:47] and i'm doing this as unto the lord
[9:50] my brother brother samuel i i got such a
[9:53] wonderful thought of the face of jesus
[9:55] put the hoffman's head in front and look
[10:01] why submit yourselves unto your own
[10:03] husband as unto the lord so
[10:05] who who is it it's not because this man
[10:08] is such a great man
[10:10] and yet no doubt in your eyes he's a
[10:13] great man
[10:17] but you do it as unto the lord because
[10:19] there's going to be times
[10:21] you may not think he's so great
[10:24] right
[10:28] welcome home
[10:31] they're going to be times you you don't
[10:33] agree with his decision hey
[10:35] look at abraham and sarah abraham and
[10:38] sarah it wasn't er look brother brand
[10:39] what did brother man call abraham and
[10:40] sarah
[10:41] the sweethearts of the
[10:45] romeo bible juliet had nothing on
[10:47] abraham and sarah
[10:50] but brother brown would call them the
[10:52] sweethearts of the bible and brother
[10:53] brown would also tell us
[10:56] that even within the parts of it to
[10:58] where
[10:59] serie sorry i had there was a part about
[11:01] it that
[11:02] she needed deliverance only god could
[11:04] bring that deliverance from the scary
[11:06] eye abraham knowing the word he couldn't
[11:10] say
[11:11] sorry i let's get that i out of sarai
[11:14] but remember abram had to also get
[11:17] the breath of god on his life
[11:21] so the breath of god in his life would
[11:22] take care of the eye in her life oh my
[11:28] how can we glory in ourselves you can't
[11:31] glory in ourselves
[11:32] it's god that does the word it's god
[11:36] that doesn't work in our marriages in
[11:38] our homes it's not you and i
[11:39] taking something and saying well this is
[11:41] the word and glory to god i'm gonna
[11:43] bring it to pass
[11:44] you can't do that it's when the word is
[11:47] made known to us
[11:48] god makes known his word that we might
[11:51] submit to that word and say
[11:53] be it unto me lord according to that
[11:55] word and if we'll give ourselves to the
[11:57] word
[11:58] the authority and the transforming
[12:01] power is in the word to be released
[12:05] to bring the word to past in our life so
[12:08] it moves
[12:09] from thought to print to flesh
[12:12] and you and i step back and say wow
[12:15] lord what grace and god steps back and
[12:18] says behold
[12:20] it is good because it's him
[12:24] it's him so abraham even when you look
[12:28] at that with
[12:28] abraham and sarah sweethearts of the
[12:30] bible and brother brahm would tell us
[12:32] right there uh in in genesis 18
[12:36] when uh the visitation
[12:39] of of of almighty god was coming down to
[12:42] take upon his he took upon flesh but not
[12:45] under the anointing of redeemer
[12:47] but god would come down and they were
[12:50] going to receive a visitation from god
[12:53] uh in such a way it was going to bring
[12:56] such a
[12:56] an impact and a change in sarah's life
[13:00] oh my man i tell you what you see what
[13:03] invited that
[13:04] abraham yielding to god abraham himself
[13:08] can't you see the responsibility as a
[13:10] husband
[13:11] as a man to be yielded to almighty god
[13:15] to invite the presence of god into the
[13:18] home
[13:18] into the marriage because a man can't
[13:21] change this
[13:22] a man can do that this is god
[13:25] god's the one when the bible says
[13:27] marriage is
[13:28] honorable it's the oldest institution in
[13:31] the bible
[13:32] and there's only one who truly knows how
[13:35] to bring about
[13:36] all the realities and all the blessings
[13:39] and all the glory
[13:40] and all the joy and that's him who
[13:43] instituted it in the beginning
[13:46] is that right and here they're having
[13:49] this
[13:50] you know brother brahman tells you know
[13:52] they're
[13:54] i like how brother john lafontaine and i
[13:56] said heated fellowship
[13:58] in the tent you know heated fellowship
[14:02] it's amazing sometimes how we use words
[14:04] to kind of sweeten it over
[14:08] we just disagree but
[14:11] within that there was a visitation
[14:14] coming on the road
[14:17] and there they received the visitation
[14:20] even though they were sweethearts of the
[14:21] bible
[14:22] they still dealt with this parts within
[14:25] the humanity but
[14:26] god gave grace through it all then when
[14:29] you can see even in those parts
[14:32] sarah didn't go off in her own thing
[14:34] there are things that sarah said or
[14:36] sarah spoke or remember
[14:37] even when sarah when she's still under
[14:40] syria she pressed her way and
[14:42] said take hagar you know she's going to
[14:44] tell abraham
[14:45] this is how the will of god is going to
[14:47] be accomplished every time that happens
[14:49] it always ends out in an ishmaelite
[14:54] you see that's the same way it is the a
[14:56] church without the leadership
[14:58] of the holy spirit what does it produce
[15:00] ishmael light
[15:02] is that right resistant and wild against
[15:05] the word
[15:07] are you with me but that's why that's
[15:10] why it can be a man standing in
[15:11] preaching the word
[15:12] and still if it's not the holy spirit
[15:15] anointed in that man's life and that man
[15:17] himself
[15:18] has met god on the sacred sands of god's
[15:20] grace
[15:21] then that's still a dominating female
[15:24] spirit
[15:26] because it's not it's not god's correct
[15:29] way of leading his church god yes he has
[15:33] man there to leave but it's not the man
[15:35] that's really leading the church
[15:36] it's the holy spirit delivering the word
[15:39] and the word
[15:40] is what is leading you and i it's the
[15:42] word that is feeding you and i
[15:43] it's the same pillar fire that moses got
[15:46] all of his leadership from
[15:48] that same pillar of fire has returned to
[15:51] the church of the living god and we're
[15:52] not strangers no more
[15:54] we are thoroughly acquainted as adopted
[15:58] sons and daughters of god
[16:00] that the presence of almighty god is
[16:03] right here in our midst and right in our
[16:05] homes right in our lives
[16:07] we have access to the holy of holies
[16:10] [Applause]
[16:15] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[16:17] husbands as unto the lord
[16:19] let me just i want to read this
[16:21] definition and i am i'm keeping track of
[16:23] time up here
[16:26] but notice this this word submit
[16:29] it's the word hupatasa and i want you to
[16:31] notice and what i'm going to read
[16:33] don't read ahead of me now what i'm
[16:35] going to read nowhere
[16:38] is submission the result of force
[16:43] are you hearing me it's nowhere the
[16:44] result of force
[16:47] here's the word it means to arrange
[16:50] under to subordinate to subject put in
[16:52] subjection
[16:53] here's the that part to subject one's
[16:56] self obey
[17:00] that's really the heart of it to subject
[17:01] oneself obey
[17:03] to submit to one's control to yield to
[17:06] one's admonition or advice
[17:08] to obey to be subject now
[17:11] go to the next part so
[17:15] the first part deals with military
[17:18] coming under
[17:19] a leadership but in non-military can you
[17:22] go down to that line in non-military use
[17:24] it was
[17:24] a voluntary attitude somebody say
[17:27] voluntary attitude
[17:29] thanks for volunteering a voluntary
[17:32] attitude of
[17:33] giving in
[17:36] you how does the new birth come
[17:40] first starts with the right mental
[17:42] attitude
[17:44] is that right when god spoke to mary
[17:48] he first had to get her mind lined up
[17:50] with the word brother
[17:51] says in spoken words original seed it
[17:53] doesn't pass the mind but the mind opens
[17:55] up and receives the word
[17:57] and it's the word not our thoughts the
[17:59] word that has life in it
[18:01] and as we open up and receive the word
[18:04] it's the word that has life and the word
[18:05] comes down into the womb
[18:08] but what does it start with the right
[18:10] mental attitude
[18:11] so all to get in the right mental
[18:13] attitude and i think we can
[18:15] we know even as across the board here as
[18:17] families and things like that
[18:19] that's sometimes before it has to be
[18:21] before you can anything at all
[18:23] it's got to get things in the right
[18:24] mental attitude is that right
[18:26] sometimes over and over it isn't like
[18:28] whoo you know we were married we said i
[18:30] do and i do and i do and i do and i do
[18:33] and i read off all of my promises and
[18:35] i'll always be the first to admit that
[18:37] i'm the one who's wrong and
[18:39] how are they
[18:42] always pray guarding give them grace to
[18:44] live the vows that they've made
[18:46] because you're going to need grace is
[18:48] that right you're going to need grace
[18:50] to live out those vows so it isn't just
[18:52] something that just well right here it
[18:54] said i do i do
[18:55] there's a commitment there's an old all
[18:57] of those things that that are made
[19:00] but it takes the grace of god within it
[19:02] that even at times to come to a place
[19:05] over and over and over again
[19:08] of a right mental attitude
[19:11] i know i know i i know as we talk right
[19:14] here there's sometimes when you come
[19:16] into situations
[19:17] and you're no different than me and
[19:19] sometimes we come into a situation you
[19:21] think
[19:21] my how how are you going to get out of
[19:24] this
[19:25] how are we going to get through this no
[19:28] maybe none of the rest of you build
[19:30] bridges
[19:32] maybe you just do the kind and say ah
[19:33] the bridge will be there when we get
[19:35] there if not we'll just go through the
[19:36] water
[19:38] then some of us are like ordering home
[19:40] depot on those hey bring the wood we're
[19:42] going to build the bridge here we're
[19:43] going to do this and you
[19:44] you don't talk about building bridge
[19:45] we've got it we've got i got to figure
[19:47] all this out i got to put all this in
[19:49] line you know
[19:50] and god will use that when it's
[19:51] surrendered to him
[19:53] you see god doesn't knock those things
[19:55] it's knocking it out of our life
[19:57] but god teaches us to yield those things
[20:00] in our life
[20:01] god needs those different things just as
[20:02] much as he needs those who just say
[20:04] don't worry about it when any time when
[20:06] we get there it'll be there we'll walk
[20:08] right over
[20:09] god we need those times
[20:16] so a voluntary attitude of giving in and
[20:20] cooperating and assuming responsibility
[20:22] and carrying a birth
[20:23] so nowhere nowhere nowhere is this of
[20:25] force
[20:27] nowhere nowhere is this nowhere is this
[20:30] a scripture
[20:31] that is used to demean or to try to
[20:35] put someone and say you're to be in
[20:37] subjection that is the wrong spirit
[20:41] because the right spirit brings this out
[20:45] amen we're not here tonight because
[20:48] under threat we're here tonight
[20:52] because we love him we've not been
[20:56] threatened or if you don't come here
[20:58] we're gonna take your name off whatever
[20:59] it's on we're gonna
[21:01] you're here because you love him here
[21:03] you hear sometimes and here you are
[21:05] some of you no doubt you know like my
[21:06] son you you know you haven't eaten or
[21:08] eaten or have you properly say it or
[21:10] here you are tired you're thinking man
[21:12] i'm trying to press through
[21:13] everything i can do to do that but
[21:15] you're not here
[21:17] because you're under a force or a threat
[21:20] it's one thing to be encouraged to come
[21:22] to the house of god because of the
[21:23] benefits
[21:24] sometimes it's as the scripture said
[21:26] forget not his
[21:27] benefits sometimes we need to be
[21:30] reminded of
[21:31] his benefits it's part of the benefit
[21:34] package
[21:35] god has a way it's just how god does it
[21:37] when believers come together and he
[21:39] speaks to our heart and
[21:40] our lives are edified in his presence
[21:43] but
[21:44] we're not here because we are made to
[21:46] come here
[21:47] we're here because we love him
[21:52] that's what it's all about now
[21:56] let me just let me just have i i'm
[21:58] watching it here
[22:01] you probably think how are you watching
[22:02] it don't worry i got two things in front
[22:05] of me here
[22:08] i know when this goes red i know what
[22:10] that means
[22:12] but it seems like i'm disobeying it
[22:13] right now
[22:16] let me just let let me cover this here
[22:19] and we'll try to try we'll tie it up
[22:20] here
[22:22] brother batman the fat tyrant church age
[22:24] i want to read this quote
[22:28] bill graham says now a woman is not
[22:30] meant to have
[22:32] an iron disposition
[22:36] let me just let me just just speak on
[22:38] this a little bit
[22:41] because when we look at this statement
[22:44] here
[22:47] there can be things
[22:50] no doubt that you have experienced or a
[22:52] person could experience in their life
[22:55] that would cause certain things from
[22:58] wounds to scars to form now once you
[23:02] remember
[23:03] a scar is a sign of healing
[23:08] are you with me it's a sign healing has
[23:11] come
[23:12] but sometimes the memories of different
[23:14] things sometimes it's a memory of
[23:16] something that
[23:17] you know maybe as a woman that
[23:20] maybe seen all that seen all her life
[23:23] was
[23:23] men who were who were not reputable
[23:26] at all are you hearing me
[23:30] not in other words has not seen a real
[23:34] true image of what a real true
[23:37] man is
[23:40] and there's things that maybe has taken
[23:42] place that has shaped
[23:44] and put certain things in a certain
[23:46] place
[23:47] that god did not desire it to be
[23:51] but here's the here's the good thing the
[23:53] holy spirit working by the love of god
[23:55] can begin to take in that life as that
[23:58] life can
[23:59] can recognize that and say lord mold me
[24:03] and shape me lord jesus
[24:06] because let me just say this to you let
[24:08] me say this very clearly
[24:10] there's not one female
[24:14] and yes when you're born you're either
[24:16] male or female
[24:22] there's not one female that enters in to
[24:25] this world
[24:25] from birth with an iron disposition
[24:32] sometimes the things that we end up we
[24:34] deal with
[24:35] is previous moldings
[24:39] sometimes the things that even we deal
[24:41] with even after god
[24:43] has done such a deep work in our life is
[24:46] sometimes we're still
[24:47] emptying out of wrong teaching
[24:51] are you with me i'm talking about things
[24:53] that get into that spirit realm in the
[24:55] conscience
[24:56] where people a person can't let this go
[24:58] because if they don't do this and
[24:59] if i don't do this i'm not a real
[25:01] christian
[25:03] and yet it doesn't line up with the word
[25:05] at all
[25:08] you understand what i'm saying you could
[25:09] take different ones man if
[25:11] if they don't if they don't they don't
[25:13] speak in tongues every service
[25:14] oh they're defeated if i don't do this
[25:17] every i'm defeated
[25:20] you see it becomes something to try to
[25:22] feed their victory victory is not fed in
[25:24] that way
[25:25] that's not victory victory is in knowing
[25:29] that my redeemer liveth and he's living
[25:32] inside of my life
[25:34] he's changed my life and with that
[25:35] victory in my life
[25:37] there is nothing nothing
[25:40] can separate me from the love of christ
[25:44] that's real victory
[25:45] that's a real victory day in our life
[25:49] so brotherhood says see according to the
[25:51] holy scripture
[25:52] she is according to the holy scripture
[25:54] see here's the standard now
[25:56] is to be submissive to the mountain look
[25:58] at the word submissive think what we
[26:00] just read
[26:01] that is commanded of her see the word
[26:03] the word
[26:04] issues a command and a command and a
[26:06] demand is not the same thing
[26:08] it's not the same thing it is god's
[26:11] direction
[26:12] for our life woman who is truly female
[26:16] that's a big statement all female
[26:19] will be of that disposition
[26:23] not a doormat so this comes back to
[26:25] that's a natural attribute
[26:27] within within even
[26:31] the smallest the baby the little girl
[26:33] all of that that's
[26:34] naturally within there nobody had to
[26:37] take
[26:38] those as mothers and those of you that
[26:40] are grandmothers now and you know your
[26:41] grandchildren are innocent and
[26:43] everything they do
[26:44] uh you know how it is nobody had to put
[26:46] that in you and say hey come on you're
[26:47] to be a mom you're to be a mom you're
[26:49] gonna be a mom you're to be a mom you're
[26:50] it was within you there's things begin
[26:53] to stir that out even as you had your
[26:55] baby doll or maybe you had you know a
[26:57] little puppy around the house when
[26:59] and don't go trying to put quotes on me
[27:01] on that one you had you know you're just
[27:02] trying to mother something around as a
[27:04] little there's an attribute
[27:06] that was within you and in god's own
[27:08] choosing
[27:09] his season and his time his will
[27:12] that attribute is released by god
[27:16] for the glory of god that in all things
[27:18] god himself
[27:20] might be glorified it's god who arranges
[27:23] all that together
[27:25] and even in lies oh glory even in
[27:29] lives that the enemy wanted to shatter
[27:31] the enemy wanted to break down
[27:34] of things we find in the scripture we
[27:36] find things in the scripture
[27:38] you can take the woman at the well you
[27:39] could say ruth the morbidity
[27:41] you can even take in the script even in
[27:43] the message or brother random
[27:44] the spirit of god countless numbers of
[27:46] times when there were sisters
[27:48] and women of god that had experienced
[27:52] things in their life
[27:53] but god in his grace would come down and
[27:56] loosen the hole that was there in that
[27:58] subconscious realm
[28:00] it would break the whole that was
[28:02] hindering them from expressing
[28:04] what was really a desire to express in
[28:06] their life
[28:08] and god is never defeated let's say he's
[28:11] never defeated
[28:13] there's no challenge too big for god
[28:16] there's no complex too big for god
[28:18] there's no past situation too big for
[28:21] god
[28:21] there's no previous molding too big for
[28:24] god that god says whoa
[28:26] this is too big for me but god's got
[28:28] confidence
[28:29] in the life working in the sea it
[28:32] will produce because why
[28:35] that dna as a son and daughter of god is
[28:39] greater than your family tree
[28:43] hallelujah it's the tree of life the man
[28:45] tree that we've been born of
[28:56] not a doormat
[28:59] not a doormat is that up there okay
[29:02] thank you such a patch he said
[29:03] yeah that's there god bless you sister
[29:07] fancy i love that
[29:09] not a doormat see submission is not a
[29:13] force deal
[29:14] amen submission
[29:18] is actually the glory from a husband
[29:22] that has submitted himself
[29:25] and now that same glory is reflected
[29:29] in the wife and through the wife
[29:32] that's honor not a doormat
[29:35] no real male boy these are some good
[29:37] words right now no real male
[29:39] no real female
[29:42] don't post that huh no real male makes
[29:46] a female a doormat
[29:49] is that right no no no she would never
[29:52] because you see when god
[29:56] when god opened up the side of adam
[30:00] when he was going to take a bride he
[30:02] never went down here
[30:04] and opened his foot
[30:07] right he didn't open his foot because
[30:10] he's not to be walked on
[30:13] but god came right here and he opened up
[30:18] and he took the part closest to his
[30:21] heart
[30:23] because it would be that that that
[30:26] coming that that moving together that
[30:28] that impression it fits that mold
[30:31] perfectly
[30:34] you look back and look at things and
[30:36] i've told my wife and i've talked about
[30:37] this many
[30:38] times i said i am so glad for the
[30:40] leadership of the holy spirit
[30:42] because i said god knows exactly how to
[30:44] influence us how to direct us how to
[30:46] bring things about
[30:47] because to me there is nobody else for
[30:50] me for my wife
[30:53] outside of the lord i mean
[30:57] i mean she she knows how to deal with me
[31:01] she knows how to say you're hungry come
[31:03] on let's get some deeds
[31:06] come on you're hungry it's time to break
[31:08] the fast let's go
[31:10] so you know she knows how to to work
[31:12] within those things she knows how to
[31:14] to minister and to care god put us
[31:16] together in that way the same way god
[31:18] put you together
[31:20] i'm saying this now because even at that
[31:23] time when we stood here in 1998
[31:25] on this platform right now there is no
[31:28] way in the world that i
[31:29] recognize that to the fullness at that
[31:31] moment
[31:33] no way but as time goes on
[31:36] as as things i tell you the love just
[31:38] grows deeper and deeper and deep
[31:41] and you recognize oh my this is the
[31:43] sovereignty of god
[31:45] it was god it wasn't me choosing and
[31:47] saying well i'm gonna take her away it
[31:49] was god
[31:50] influencing my life god influencing her
[31:53] life
[31:55] and if god thought if she thought i was
[31:57] handsome god did a good job of
[31:58] influencing her
[32:02] because even at that time i had
[32:03] see-through hair not a doormat
[32:06] no real male makes a female a doormat
[32:10] let's just close here but she will
[32:14] want to be under
[32:17] authority and not rule over the mail
[32:22] for he is the head of the house
[32:26] but sammy what what are we seeing here
[32:28] responsibility
[32:31] because she must have authority to
[32:34] submit to
[32:36] leadership
[32:40] provides a place of rest
[32:44] a place of submission
[32:48] a place of confidence
[32:51] she will want to be under authority
[32:54] don't we want to be under the authority
[32:55] of the lord
[32:57] amen sometimes as his word comes and
[33:00] it cuts sometimes he has to he doesn't
[33:03] always come and tell us
[33:04] yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
[33:07] yes
[33:07] lord i want this and i want that yes yes
[33:10] yes yes yes yes
[33:12] okay that credit card's max here take
[33:14] this one yes yes yes yes yes yes
[33:17] god doesn't do that and i'm not just i'm
[33:19] not i'm not making light of
[33:21] shopping because sometimes there's men
[33:23] that's just as bad
[33:26] but it's not all yes sometimes god he
[33:30] god loves us so much he'll tell us
[33:33] no he'll tell us no
[33:38] now let's just be honest brother doug
[33:41] our flesh rejoices more in the yeses
[33:44] than it does the nose but brother aaron
[33:46] the longer we serve him we begin to
[33:48] recognize
[33:49] when he says no that's just as much love
[33:54] isn't that right brother dave it's just
[33:56] as much love when he says
[33:57] no as when he says yes
[34:01] i don't need to know why he said no i
[34:03] don't need to know that i didn't know if
[34:04] he said no
[34:05] is something that he sees it may not
[34:07] even be something that's sinful
[34:09] he can just see that will not be for my
[34:12] good
[34:13] god is always interested
[34:17] in our best interest
[34:21] that's his love that's his care for our
[34:24] lives
[34:25] so when i look at this i see such a
[34:27] great responsibility that's laid before
[34:29] us
[34:30] as husbands and to live
[34:34] and to have have that that display
[34:36] because what's real authority
[34:38] what's real authority as a son of god
[34:41] not rules
[34:43] but it's the word it's the image of that
[34:46] word that life
[34:47] living out in our lives
[34:50] and remember don't don't compare
[34:51] yourself to one another just yield and
[34:54] let that word
[34:55] image and be certain that that word
[34:57] image is reflecting through your life
[34:59] and if there's anything that's hindering
[35:01] that reflection
[35:02] die to it die to it that the word
[35:06] can be reflected because
[35:09] what is the wife really as she's
[35:11] submitting as
[35:12] when she submits to the husband as unto
[35:16] the lord i think what greater thing can
[35:18] be
[35:19] but to see the lord and yet there can be
[35:22] times
[35:23] that a person doesn't see the lord
[35:26] whatsoever
[35:26] and then this is where the other part
[35:28] comes in
[35:30] that as bill braham says in the message
[35:31] respects if you can't respect the person
[35:35] you respect the office that they hold
[35:38] that's why the scripture says submitting
[35:40] yourselves unto one another
[35:41] in the fear of the lord
[35:45] you love him amen and i'm just
[35:48] i'll just stop here we'll pick this up
[35:50] lord willing next week
[35:51] and keep on we just got a little ways
[35:53] and i know i took some time to speak to
[35:55] you beforehand
[35:56] but i'll just i'm just going to be
[35:57] honest with you as your pastor
[36:01] over the years i can tell you how i've
[36:04] prayed and i've never stopped praying
[36:07] i've continued to ask god lord
[36:11] make me a better husband make me a
[36:14] better father
[36:16] make me a better pastor make me a better
[36:19] brother to my brothers and my sisters
[36:21] better servant when i say make me help
[36:23] me
[36:24] show me what's lacking help me
[36:27] teach me because there's growth and i
[36:30] can say
[36:30] i can say this i say this before you
[36:33] there's a lot of things that god
[36:35] and i don't say this it's not elevating
[36:36] me it's things that what god has shown
[36:39] me
[36:40] oh i that's why many times i look back
[36:43] on certain things and i try to
[36:45] speak of these things even as a council
[36:47] and things like that because i know
[36:49] the grace that's come to me that god has
[36:52] helped me and things that is just so
[36:55] blessed our home but what if i had been
[36:58] a person to say
[37:00] i don't need anybody to teach me
[37:04] where would our home be today
[37:07] where would our home be where would this
[37:08] church be today
[37:13] but when a man is born of the holy
[37:15] spirit he receives the inside teacher
[37:18] and one of the sure evidences is he can
[37:20] be taught by the word
[37:23] he can be corrected he can be
[37:27] he can he because his what's the desire
[37:29] he delights
[37:30] in the word always desiring when he can
[37:34] see the word is put here to put
[37:36] ourselves under that word lord forgive
[37:37] me
[37:38] see that's the part that corresponds as
[37:40] the bride of jesus christ in our lives
[37:42] to come under the authority of that word
[37:45] it's not god demanding it
[37:46] but his love it it unfolds
[37:50] that word and in the tremendous how god
[37:51] will come around and bring correction
[37:53] and it comes with such love this is why
[37:56] paul said speaking the truth
[37:58] in love that we grow up into him in all
[38:01] things
[38:03] we need the truth spoken but we need it
[38:05] spoken in love
[38:07] is that right because it's god's grace
[38:10] because it
[38:10] at the end of the day when we as we're
[38:13] uh looking into the word all
[38:15] musicians brother brian come as we're
[38:17] looking into the word
[38:18] and when conviction strikes our heart i
[38:21] want to move into that word
[38:23] brother drake when there's things that i
[38:24] don't see that's exactly right and i can
[38:26] say oh god i'm falling short there lord
[38:28] help me lord jesus help me the lord i
[38:32] want to grow in that particular area i
[38:34] want to
[38:34] i want to move on lord with you i don't
[38:36] want to make excuses for things but when
[38:38] that word shows up things in my life
[38:40] you know what that's god telling me
[38:42] samuel there's a greater liberty for you
[38:46] there's greater liberty for you so
[38:49] there's not one of us that's here
[38:50] tonight
[38:52] that's perfect in ourselves
[38:56] but tonight this is our confession i'm
[39:00] not what i used to be
[39:03] not what i want to be i've maybe got
[39:05] that all mixed up
[39:06] i'm not what i want to be not what i
[39:08] ought to be but i thank god i'm
[39:11] not what i used to be what's happened
[39:13] something
[39:14] someone has got a hold of your life
[39:18] and has changed you what did that
[39:22] the love of god to where your desire is
[39:25] to please him he can deal with your
[39:26] heart in a prayer closet he can deal
[39:27] with your heart
[39:29] anywhere right here you can deal with
[39:31] your life and there's a desire to please
[39:33] him
[39:35] that's discerning the love of god let's
[39:38] just pray could we
[39:41] heavenly father we love you tonight lord

[41:24] every child of god here tonight lord
[41:27] born of the holy spirit having the seal
[41:29] of the living god in their life
[41:31] it's because lord that we've fallen in
[41:35] love with you
[41:37] it was not our love it was your love
[41:41] we love him because he first loved
[41:44] us so lord it's not us loving you with
[41:49] our own love that would fail
[41:51] that's unacceptable but it's loving you
[41:56] with your own love
[41:59] that has been received and brought about
[42:02] a change in our life
[42:03] where the holds of the world have been
[42:05] dismantled and now coming right back out
[42:07] of our life
[42:09] is a reflection of that same love
