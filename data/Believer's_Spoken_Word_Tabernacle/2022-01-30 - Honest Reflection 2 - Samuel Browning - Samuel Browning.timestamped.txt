[47:53] word of the lord and just want to say i
[47:55] appreciate the song service and
[47:57] brother bill was singing that song i
[47:59] knew better than even try it i know the
[48:00] song but you know it's one thing to know
[48:02] the song and for me to try to go through
[48:04] it but i love the words to that song and
[48:07] and i just appreciate them you know just
[48:09] just trying to move that along and
[48:12] um
[48:13] let's just let's look here at haggai
[48:15] chapter one and i'm just going to read
[48:16] two verses of scripture then we'll let
[48:17] you be seated
[48:19] in haggai 1 1
[48:21] it says
[48:22] in the second year
[48:25] of darius the king
[48:28] in the sixth month in the first year of
[48:30] the month
[48:31] came the word of the lord by haggai
[48:34] the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of
[48:37] shatil
[48:38] governor of judah
[48:40] and to joshua the son of joseph the high
[48:42] priest saying
[48:44] thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying
[48:47] this people say
[48:50] the time is not come
[48:52] the time that the lord's house
[48:55] should be built
[48:56] amen may god bless you and bless the
[48:58] reading of the word as you're being
[49:00] seated
[49:02] i want you to notice how the scriptures
[49:20] lord jesus
[49:31] so lord jesus as we stand here god
[49:33] united with our brother lord
[49:36] you see father that the lord just
[49:38] exactly what the lord has been through
[49:40] here more even more with your surgery
[49:43] how would you have brought them through
[49:46] such grace and such strength the lord
[49:48] the father who we lord stand here o god
[49:51] is a people of god
[49:53] lord when it comes to taking our
[49:55] promised land sometimes lord we need
[49:58] help one from another lord so we stand
[50:00] right here together lord uniting our
[50:03] faith together lord for you say lord if
[50:05] two or three can agree is touching any
[50:07] one thing it shall be done not satan in
[50:10] the name of jesus christ you that would
[50:12] want to bring this weariness i charge
[50:15] you in the name of the lord jesus christ
[50:18] and i rebuke you you must take your
[50:21] hands off and flee
[50:22] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[50:26] lord i ask that god that you would move
[50:28] lord to give such strength the lord a
[50:30] consolation o god in this moment i pray
[50:33] father for lord you are
[50:36] our peace
[50:37] and lord we speak peace in the name of
[50:40] jesus christ
[50:42] so satan hold your peace
[50:46] in the name of jesus christ
[50:54] [Applause]
[51:05] i want to just say as we look at this
[51:06] here in the scripture i want to god will
[51:09] help us to continue with this thought on
[51:11] honest reflections
[51:14] these are really some these are familiar
[51:17] passages probably to most of us and even
[51:19] as bible readers
[51:22] i've you know that those of you here
[51:24] over the years sometimes i've ministered
[51:26] a
[51:27] series
[51:28] out of this whole part about the
[51:31] restoration and the restoring back
[51:34] into the land
[51:35] where israel had went into captivity and
[51:38] then they were promised by god that he
[51:40] would visit him after 70 years
[51:44] and i just
[51:46] just
[51:47] you know last week we we took the
[51:49] thought
[51:51] on this of honest reflections and begin
[51:53] to deal with how that
[51:55] daniel
[51:57] knowing the time was drawing nigh was
[51:59] about at the 68 year mark and he he
[52:02] could read in the book but you know it's
[52:04] something about it that it goes much
[52:06] deeper
[52:07] than just us reading something begins to
[52:10] stir us in that time
[52:12] you know there's things that you and i
[52:13] can't explain sometimes as a believers
[52:15] things just start to stir you
[52:17] to start to move you and that's the
[52:19] thing that if you'll think in this
[52:21] moment where brother branham will take
[52:23] us of how the israel is moved by natural
[52:27] national forces back into the homeland
[52:30] but he says it is the spirit of the
[52:33] living god who puts the people in the
[52:35] bride
[52:37] so we know that national forces will
[52:39] have to get that has to get israel back
[52:41] in there and that that's been going on
[52:43] but once they get back in there it's
[52:45] going to take it'll take the coming of
[52:46] the holy ghost and god will come in that
[52:49] message of the true atonement through
[52:51] moses and elijah to point them to that
[52:54] of the true atonement and that they
[52:55] might be
[52:56] sealed away that 144 thousand
[52:59] but i want to just as a draw to this
[53:01] here and this was really the a part of
[53:04] it how god was just pressing on my heart
[53:06] here just a few weeks ago and sometimes
[53:08] you know you just don't know how
[53:10] uh
[53:11] you just the thought just drops and how
[53:13] everything begins to come together but i
[53:15] want to draw this this here in haggai 1.
[53:19] this is after the people have already
[53:21] come into the land and i'm going to give
[53:22] you a timeline here in just a moment but
[53:25] i want you to notice in verse 1 and
[53:27] verse 2
[53:28] that here is haggai the prophet and
[53:30] haggai
[53:32] is not coming with a new message
[53:35] but haggai
[53:37] is being moved by the spirit of god in
[53:39] this moment because the people are
[53:43] saying
[53:44] that the time is not come
[53:46] the time that the lord's house should be
[53:48] built
[53:50] and to think this is a discernment this
[53:52] is why
[53:53] we must have
[53:55] the living word of god
[53:57] the word of god the letter is wonderful
[54:01] but without the spirit of god the letter
[54:04] killeth right amen jesus could stand
[54:07] before the pharisees in that hour the
[54:09] religious and say search the scriptures
[54:12] for in them you think you have eternal
[54:14] life but they are they that are
[54:15] testifying of me
[54:17] and we know that when the word comes the
[54:19] word comes it's a discerner of the
[54:21] thoughts and intents of the heart every
[54:23] time you can read clear from the very
[54:25] beginning uh you know even as the spirit
[54:28] of god will take us clear back to the
[54:30] fall that took and took place in heaven
[54:32] and then coming down into the garden and
[54:34] on and on we find that the word of god
[54:37] every time that god begins to bring his
[54:40] word in that season
[54:42] it is god that word comes and brings
[54:44] discernment and that discernment is
[54:46] necessary and the only people that are
[54:48] going to be a partaker of that
[54:50] discernment and really receive it are
[54:52] those whom the word is actually intended
[54:55] for
[54:56] many will hear it brother brown would
[54:57] say it like this it's broadcast to many
[55:00] but there are those that's ordained to
[55:03] life and not that they in themselves or
[55:05] we in ourselves were perfect but we
[55:07] needed the discernment of the spirit of
[55:09] god to break those conditions that was
[55:12] from around us it wouldn't matter if you
[55:14] were in you know in a church and thank
[55:16] god wherever you had your start at and
[55:18] you know you start for the lord there's
[55:20] a start but there's a hunger within your
[55:23] life that only god himself could satisfy
[55:26] you are ordained not just to be uh
[55:30] fellowshipping around god as your savior
[55:32] becoming your savior but you are
[55:34] ordained to be a part of that mystical
[55:38] body of jesus christ by the holy spirit
[55:41] placing you in his bright body amen so
[55:44] you are ordained for that we didn't make
[55:47] ourselves that but to find that we
[55:49] needed the discernment of the spirit of
[55:51] god to break the darkness that was
[55:54] around our life
[55:55] we had darkness around our life like it
[55:57] speaks in genesis 1. yet there was seed
[56:00] on the inside that had been planted by
[56:03] god but there's only one thing that can
[56:05] bring that seed to life there had to be
[56:07] the right atmosphere the right
[56:09] conditions and it takes the word of god
[56:12] god said let there be light
[56:15] and there was light so the word itself
[56:18] is light and the light is the word
[56:21] the very first light there was was not
[56:23] sunlight it was shekinah light it was
[56:26] god's own life because it's by his life
[56:29] that he has brought the order to all of
[56:31] these things that that seed might come
[56:34] out and express itself for what god
[56:36] intended it to be
[56:38] so that discernment is necessary to come
[56:41] down and to discern the very thoughts of
[56:44] our heart i want the living word of god
[56:46] to discern the thoughts of my heart
[56:49] because there's there's purposes i have
[56:51] purposes you have there's things that we
[56:53] have that we are deliberating about
[56:56] and we want we want to know god what do
[56:59] you say about this
[57:01] what do you think about this lord
[57:04] and so when we're looking at honest
[57:06] reflections we know that as we were kind
[57:08] of looking at that last week in that of
[57:10] a mirror where you look into a mirror
[57:13] and you you you know you what you see
[57:16] is setting before you and you and we
[57:18] have to take an account of that the word
[57:20] of god is a mirror and as we were
[57:22] looking at that last week that a mirror
[57:24] itself without light
[57:26] in the mirror does no good you can make
[57:28] out certain things like brother brown
[57:30] could say there's been enough light to
[57:32] join a church there's been enough light
[57:34] you know for this there's been he said
[57:35] but in the evening time there was
[57:38] promise i will send the light in the
[57:41] evening time where it's you know gray
[57:43] and dismal and dark and divided opinions
[57:46] but in this hour he said i will send the
[57:48] light and that light is his word is
[57:51] himself is his power
[57:56] god didn't send us theology this message
[57:59] is not theology amen
[58:02] amen
[58:04] this message is the power of god unto
[58:07] salvation
[58:10] god has restored
[58:12] what was lost from the church of the
[58:16] living god let me tell you we're living
[58:18] in an hour where the word has come in
[58:20] this hour that god has taken us beyond
[58:23] where the ephesian age was because the
[58:25] ephesian age was already a fallen woman
[58:28] god has taken us back to that of
[58:31] pentecost where christ himself became
[58:35] veiled in a body of believers the bride
[58:41] amen but the church ages all they were
[58:44] there was a hidden mystery in god all of
[58:46] that to take out a people for his
[58:49] namesake he's been building his body
[58:52] just like what the sight of adam was
[58:54] opened and out of that came forth that
[58:56] body he's been building it now how does
[58:58] he build it he builds it by his word
[59:01] amen
[59:03] oh my
[59:04] so notice here the people the word comes
[59:07] to discern and says
[59:09] thus speaketh the lord of hosts my my
[59:12] mind well we could really preach on that
[59:13] one the lord of hosts
[59:15] this is we we are we are in the company
[59:17] of the lord of hosts
[59:19] we are in the company of an innumerable
[59:23] mount of angels
[59:26] hallelujah if gathered around the lord
[59:28] of hosts is with
[59:30] us you lord hallelujah
[59:34] this people say
[59:36] now i want you to notice the timeline if
[59:38] we can go into this here
[59:40] the timeline i think i put that in there
[59:42] just so i can uh go through it with with
[59:45] you as a people just
[59:46] i don't hope it's not so scrunched
[59:47] together next slide please
[59:49] um here we have the the people return
[59:52] back
[59:56] is it is it upward
[59:59] okay there we go i
[1:00:01] look at the look at the uh
[1:00:04] at the asterisks if you don't mind look
[1:00:05] at the asterisks here and i've put up
[1:00:08] the i've put up the dates i don't want
[1:00:10] to stand in front of you here's where
[1:00:12] 537
[1:00:14] bc they returned
[1:00:15] from
[1:00:17] babylon this is the first group remember
[1:00:19] god said
[1:00:20] after 70 years are accomplished i will
[1:00:24] restore it amen amen right jeremiah 29.
[1:00:29] now
[1:00:30] notice here when this is done they come
[1:00:32] back in 537
[1:00:35] here within the second year of their
[1:00:36] return the foundation of the temple is
[1:00:39] begun and then it stopped by opposition
[1:00:43] now when they first came back into the
[1:00:44] land
[1:00:46] they came in and they the first thing
[1:00:48] they did was they set up the altar in
[1:00:50] its place
[1:00:52] you've got to know where the altar is
[1:00:54] you've got to know where the offering is
[1:00:56] you've got to get to the true sacrifice
[1:00:58] if there's going to be any building or
[1:01:01] the foundation laid at all you got to
[1:01:03] get through the right sacrifice
[1:01:05] is that right this is why when they come
[1:01:08] back the first things first is get to
[1:01:10] the altar so it is an exalting that's
[1:01:12] why this end time message it does not
[1:01:15] exalt a man's idea it exalts jesus
[1:01:19] christ amen in a finished work
[1:01:23] in the spirit of god it's god coming to
[1:01:26] take his word and exalt that before the
[1:01:29] people raise the standard of the word up
[1:01:32] you realize the raising of the standard
[1:01:34] is christ himself coming in his body and
[1:01:37] he first comes in that way through him
[1:01:39] by the veil of a prophet and it's
[1:01:41] manifest before the people that this is
[1:01:44] not the theology of a man these are not
[1:01:46] the thoughts of a man as clearly as
[1:01:49] brother branham put it in mighty god
[1:01:50] unveiled before us 1964 he said to think
[1:01:54] of the message of the hour the expressed
[1:01:57] thoughts of jehovah amen
[1:02:01] see it's going it's calling us back
[1:02:03] where did where where when the condition
[1:02:05] was in israel where did elijah bring
[1:02:08] them back to he brought them back to
[1:02:10] mount carmel
[1:02:12] he's there's got to be a repairing of
[1:02:14] the altar
[1:02:15] if we're to receive the promises there
[1:02:18] is no promises outside of jesus christ
[1:02:23] but inside of jesus christ if we can see
[1:02:26] him the resurrected christ the mighty
[1:02:29] conqueror and we can come into that
[1:02:31] place of being identified with him that
[1:02:33] everything that you and i have need of
[1:02:36] is in him and he is in you
[1:02:41] come back to the altar first
[1:02:44] now here's what they did when they came
[1:02:45] into the land they begin to build as far
[1:02:48] as the altar then from the altar they
[1:02:50] had to lay the foundation
[1:02:52] and when you think of that foundation
[1:02:54] that foundation paul could say i have
[1:02:56] laid the foundation where no other man
[1:02:58] can lay
[1:02:59] and that's the foundation is what jesus
[1:03:02] christ
[1:03:02] so it takes that of the altar to bring
[1:03:05] the foundation stone or the foundation
[1:03:08] reality into our life where we're not by
[1:03:11] our faith any longer but now we're
[1:03:14] living by the faith of the son of god
[1:03:16] who loved me
[1:03:17] and gave himself for me
[1:03:20] is that right
[1:03:21] that's why brother branham could say in
[1:03:23] god's chosen place of worship he said
[1:03:24] that foundation stone that he placed in
[1:03:26] you from before the foundation of the
[1:03:28] world
[1:03:29] what's the foundation stone it's the
[1:03:31] seed now when the spirit of god comes to
[1:03:33] quicken and raise it up that's your
[1:03:34] foundation
[1:03:37] everything that he builds upon
[1:03:40] the tabernacle he builds it upon himself
[1:03:42] so his his working in our life is not
[1:03:45] built
[1:03:46] upon our work that's right
[1:03:49] it's word added to word add it to word
[1:03:50] add it to word added toward it's his
[1:03:52] working in our lives
[1:03:55] oh my
[1:03:57] now
[1:03:58] notice here so they come back in in 5 35
[1:04:02] the
[1:04:03] this temple has begun but it's stopped
[1:04:05] by opposition
[1:04:07] that's what i'm going to deal with right
[1:04:08] here hallelujah
[1:04:10] then in 5 20 is when the rebuilding of
[1:04:12] the temple resumed now watch this from 5
[1:04:15] 20 to 5 16 is only four years
[1:04:18] when they got going again only four
[1:04:19] years and the temple's done
[1:04:22] but notice between these two right here
[1:04:25] 535 to 520
[1:04:28] 15 years
[1:04:29] past
[1:04:31] and nothing was being done
[1:04:35] nothing was being done
[1:04:38] now
[1:04:39] i want to speak a little bit honest
[1:04:41] reflection
[1:04:43] and i'm not going to be in a hurry but
[1:04:45] i'm not going to hold you along either
[1:04:46] because i don't want to i'm not
[1:04:48] interested in cramming stuff in i don't
[1:04:49] want to do that
[1:04:52] but the question really should arise in
[1:04:54] our hearts
[1:04:55] why would this people say
[1:04:58] the time has not come
[1:05:00] you see god
[1:05:03] had anointed isaiah
[1:05:06] to speak of cyrus and this time coming
[1:05:08] see everything lines up
[1:05:10] god had spoken concerning cyrus my
[1:05:13] servant he called him mine anointed yes
[1:05:16] he sure did he was going to be used by
[1:05:18] god cyrus was not even a believer but he
[1:05:21] was going to be used by god amen amen is
[1:05:25] that right that's right and he would be
[1:05:27] you so
[1:05:28] you know
[1:05:29] here you would have the 70 years here
[1:05:31] where this expiring and god was going to
[1:05:34] restore them back into the land but
[1:05:37] here you find as well cyrus is raised up
[1:05:40] by the hand of god and cyrus
[1:05:43] speaks to the people of god and he lets
[1:05:46] them know i've received a commandment of
[1:05:48] the lord to build the house at jerusalem
[1:05:53] now he wasn't going to be the one to
[1:05:54] build it but there were people who were
[1:05:56] right there in that time who were
[1:05:58] ordained by god to build the house of
[1:06:01] the lord amen
[1:06:02] when that word was spoken let me tell
[1:06:04] you when that word was spoken there were
[1:06:07] people and names in the mind of god that
[1:06:10] were to be a part of that word to be
[1:06:13] fulfilled amen they may not have been on
[1:06:15] the who's whose list they may not have
[1:06:18] even been the choice
[1:06:20] of others in that hour they may not even
[1:06:22] have been the choice of their own
[1:06:24] choosing to go back and build the house
[1:06:27] of the lord but what was greater is they
[1:06:30] were in god's choosing amen
[1:06:33] and when the spirit of god began to
[1:06:36] speak through these
[1:06:37] individuals cyrus the bible says the
[1:06:39] spirit of god
[1:06:41] stirred up the elders stirred up these
[1:06:45] different ones you see the word alone
[1:06:48] it must come with the unction of the
[1:06:51] holy spirit and when god sends that word
[1:06:54] he's got hearts that he in turn intends
[1:06:56] to stir up amen
[1:06:58] he's got hearts that are going to be
[1:07:00] stirred up with a real vision
[1:07:02] it's going to be a vision that comes
[1:07:04] from the mind of god now comes into the
[1:07:06] heart of the individual
[1:07:08] it comes into that life to where it's
[1:07:11] something that moves you and i beyond
[1:07:14] even our own thinking and our own doubts
[1:07:16] it's it's greater
[1:07:18] it's a prevailing power on the inside
[1:07:24] praise the lord
[1:07:26] and they would say the time has not come
[1:07:29] now
[1:07:30] the bible says where they the people say
[1:07:32] remember the word discerns
[1:07:34] the hearts
[1:07:36] like it came to abraham and sarah's tent
[1:07:38] it discerned what sarah was laughing in
[1:07:40] her heart she wasn't giggling out loud
[1:07:42] she was in her heart
[1:07:44] so the word because you see has a man
[1:07:47] thinketh in his heart
[1:07:48] so is he yes amen
[1:07:51] is that right
[1:07:52] we can be defeated by how we think in
[1:07:55] our heart
[1:07:57] see god that's why the word comes to not
[1:07:59] only turn the heart but the word comes
[1:08:01] to deal with the heart yes amen
[1:08:04] right sure does the word has to deal and
[1:08:06] we need that we need that every service
[1:08:09] and we need that daily in our lives
[1:08:12] and i say god help us to invite that
[1:08:14] help us that we can be people that i
[1:08:16] don't just want some kind of a mirror
[1:08:18] that just you know it's always pat and
[1:08:20] samuel on the back and well you're just
[1:08:22] such a great guy and you're
[1:08:24] predestinated you're not going to miss
[1:08:26] it and you're not going to we're not
[1:08:27] talking about putting doubt out but i
[1:08:29] want i i have confidence that i am a
[1:08:32] child of god born of the spirit of god
[1:08:34] i've come from the mind of god i'm going
[1:08:37] back to the mind of god i'm going back
[1:08:39] to god i've got a confidence that i know
[1:08:41] lord all that i need i need from you
[1:08:44] lord you have every faith that i have
[1:08:47] need of
[1:08:49] i'm not interested in staying here i
[1:08:52] want to get out of here
[1:08:55] amen i'm not interested i believe you
[1:08:58] can join with me i'm not interested in
[1:09:00] living a mediocre christian life i'm
[1:09:03] interested in being on fire for god amen
[1:09:08] amen amen we're not called to be
[1:09:11] survivors amen we're called and anointed
[1:09:15] to be overcomers
[1:09:19] this time the time has not come so you
[1:09:22] know
[1:09:23] it was things coming out maybe they had
[1:09:25] conversations in their homes and you
[1:09:27] know and actions and things came about
[1:09:30] if you were to ask these people no doubt
[1:09:32] if you were to pull them aside and ask
[1:09:33] them and say do you believe the temple's
[1:09:35] to be rebuilt
[1:09:37] they'd probably tell you yes well it's
[1:09:38] going to be rebuilt
[1:09:41] but when you would
[1:09:42] narrow it down to say
[1:09:44] are you the people
[1:09:47] are you the people that's going to
[1:09:49] build the temple
[1:09:51] you'd probably find some halting
[1:09:54] that's good
[1:09:55] i think i want you to think now deep
[1:09:59] they didn't start in a halted way
[1:10:03] they started with the altar
[1:10:06] coming back and putting the altar upon
[1:10:08] the bible says upon his
[1:10:11] feet yes amen
[1:10:13] she's coming to the altar and putting
[1:10:14] that altar upon his feet his you see
[1:10:17] what it is is that
[1:10:19] everything underneath his feet is
[1:10:21] conquered
[1:10:23] everything is coming back to that
[1:10:26] that's why even in revelations 10 the
[1:10:27] mighty angel descended now put his foot
[1:10:29] upon the land upon the sea the powers
[1:10:32] that are not just not talking about
[1:10:34] natural land you're talking about
[1:10:35] spiritual powers
[1:10:38] it's talking about political power
[1:10:40] ecclesiastical power demon power right
[1:10:43] amen
[1:10:44] but it's all
[1:10:46] under the feet of the mighty angel amen
[1:10:49] and the mighty angel is the fullness of
[1:10:52] jesus christ the son of man in bright
[1:10:54] bodies
[1:10:56] and we're in christ oh you've heard this
[1:10:58] said many times i might be the skin on
[1:11:00] the bottom of his feet
[1:11:02] but every devil is under my foot
[1:11:06] are you hearing me
[1:11:08] glory be to god in the highest
[1:11:10] oh my now notice this you see
[1:11:13] there was also you remember a time
[1:11:16] in the scriptures
[1:11:17] because this is not new where things
[1:11:19] could arise and and people could say
[1:11:21] certain things
[1:11:23] in the time when israel was coming into
[1:11:25] the land of promise
[1:11:28] moses had spies sent out
[1:11:31] and when he sent them spies out they
[1:11:33] went out
[1:11:34] and ten of them begin to look at what
[1:11:37] they saw before them
[1:11:39] and they saw the opposition
[1:11:42] all they could talk about was how big
[1:11:45] the giants are
[1:11:46] right
[1:11:48] if you had coffee with them all they
[1:11:50] were going to talk about is how big the
[1:11:52] giant was on their life
[1:11:55] come on friends we need to stop talking
[1:11:58] the devil's language
[1:12:00] many of us how god has cleaned up our
[1:12:02] language and taken all of the cursing
[1:12:05] and swearing out but sometimes we get to
[1:12:07] talking negative and the prophet tells
[1:12:09] us when you go to talking negative
[1:12:12] you're talking the devil's language
[1:12:15] we are not called to talk the devil's
[1:12:17] language the bible says let the weak say
[1:12:20] i am
[1:12:22] [Applause]
[1:12:27] amen it's time to speak what god has
[1:12:30] declared in your life
[1:12:32] don't let the devil silence that up
[1:12:36] the seal's been broken the seal's been
[1:12:38] taken off of your life don't let him try
[1:12:40] to stomp it up you stand there and say
[1:12:43] what the word has said about you you
[1:12:46] take your side with the word you confess
[1:12:48] what the word is saying you say brother
[1:12:50] samuel sometimes i don't feel like it
[1:12:52] it's not about our feelings sometimes
[1:12:55] the greatest opposition that you and i
[1:12:58] have is our own feelings
[1:13:02] our own feelings our own thoughts our
[1:13:05] own about ourselves what we know but let
[1:13:08] me tell you something there's one who
[1:13:10] knows the real you on the inside and he
[1:13:13] knows really about you that saved god
[1:13:17] that placed that part of himself on the
[1:13:20] inside he's energizing that inner man
[1:13:23] with strength from himself to rise
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:28] hallelujah come on now brother graham
[1:13:31] said the biggest enemy that i've got
[1:13:34] is william branham
[1:13:37] when i can get him out of the way
[1:13:43] you say brother samuel how could he say
[1:13:45] that honest reflection
[1:13:47] brother branham knew his biggest
[1:13:48] interest it wasn't nothing out there
[1:13:51] actually his biggest enemy was not the
[1:13:53] devil
[1:13:55] remember the conquering is conquering
[1:13:58] this flesh bringing it in subjection by
[1:14:02] the spirit of the living god
[1:14:04] amen oh my i'll tell you
[1:14:07] i say god help that to become more real
[1:14:09] to us
[1:14:11] i mean continually quickened in our
[1:14:13] lives
[1:14:14] because we i know i'm talking to
[1:14:15] believers here this morning that you
[1:14:17] realize and i realize that there's
[1:14:19] things that god will come and speak to
[1:14:21] us in a service like this and then it
[1:14:23] could be months down the road or weeks
[1:14:24] down the road some other time down the
[1:14:26] road and here we are we might be facing
[1:14:28] something going through something or
[1:14:30] whatever is before us and we need a
[1:14:32] fresh word from the lord it might be the
[1:14:34] same thing that he inspired before but
[1:14:36] it ain't old manna it's the spirit of
[1:14:39] god inspiring his word to what you and i
[1:14:42] have need of and we can say thank you
[1:14:43] lord thank you father for pointing out
[1:14:46] the jawbone of the ass thank you lord
[1:14:48] for showing me the ox gold because that
[1:14:51] word when it's inspired upon by the
[1:14:54] spirit of god it might be one scripture
[1:14:56] it might be two words jesus swept but
[1:14:59] with the spirit of god in a strong hand
[1:15:01] of faith it's more than a match for the
[1:15:04] devil amen
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:13] caleb told him he said look
[1:15:15] here look what caleb did
[1:15:17] the bible said caleb stealed the people
[1:15:21] before
[1:15:22] moses amen
[1:15:24] it's very important
[1:15:26] he steals them before moses
[1:15:29] because caleb realized his authority was
[1:15:32] coming from god who had come through the
[1:15:35] prophet
[1:15:37] are you hearing me now
[1:15:39] a manner is a people in the land in the
[1:15:41] last days called the bride of jesus
[1:15:44] christ
[1:15:45] amen walking in authority under the word
[1:15:49] that god has given to you and i in this
[1:15:52] hour
[1:15:54] he steal them in the presence of moses
[1:15:56] let me tell you something the only way
[1:15:58] god has provided in this hour the word
[1:16:01] that will address and meet and defeat
[1:16:03] every giant amen are you hearing me
[1:16:07] god has addressed it already in this age
[1:16:09] i don't it doesn't matter what it is
[1:16:12] that's standing up in your life god has
[1:16:14] provided the word in this hour to
[1:16:17] address every demon out of hell every
[1:16:20] child every complex every sin all glory
[1:16:24] be to god he has already declared and
[1:16:28] manifested himself caleb steal the
[1:16:30] people before
[1:16:32] moses outside of this message you're
[1:16:35] defeated
[1:16:38] amen
[1:16:39] come on friends you cannot separate the
[1:16:42] message from the bible
[1:16:45] that's a comment i don't know where that
[1:16:47] error is coming from
[1:16:49] but it ain't coming from the throne of
[1:16:50] god
[1:16:53] this message come on now
[1:16:55] standing there in the message of grace
[1:16:57] out in sportsman's holler and the
[1:16:59] prophet setting right there where the
[1:17:00] squirrels are coming forth and here the
[1:17:02] spirit of god would begin to move upon
[1:17:05] the prophet's life and begin to reveal
[1:17:07] to him speak this and speak but remember
[1:17:10] he made himself known to him that
[1:17:12] jehovah of the old is jesus of the news
[1:17:16] amen
[1:17:18] come on friends we've got to be able to
[1:17:20] look beyond the veil and recognize who
[1:17:23] it is that's speaking if you knew who's
[1:17:25] speaking out to thee
[1:17:30] hallelujah so where do we bring them we
[1:17:32] bring it before the word of god moses is
[1:17:35] god's vindicated prophet this word that
[1:17:37] god has vindicated in this hour
[1:17:41] amen we bring the people before the
[1:17:43] vindicated word amen come on friends
[1:17:46] it's a word that god has vindicated
[1:17:49] himself
[1:17:53] let us go up at once and possess it you
[1:17:55] know what caleb was telling i'm not here
[1:17:57] to debate it
[1:17:59] i believe it amen i'm ready to act on it
[1:18:02] i'm not here to try to convince
[1:18:04] everybody else because i'm not going to
[1:18:06] convince nobody right
[1:18:08] amen
[1:18:09] come on now i'm talking about traps of
[1:18:11] the devil amen
[1:18:12] for we are well able to overcome it but
[1:18:15] the men that went up they said well
[1:18:17] i don't think we're able to
[1:18:19] we're not able to do it now the word
[1:18:22] was discerning what was in their heart
[1:18:25] amen and we know that in this case i'm
[1:18:28] going to move on from here but just to
[1:18:30] take that as an example it was
[1:18:31] opposition that arose up that caused the
[1:18:34] people to pull back
[1:18:36] from the promise of god
[1:18:39] opposition
[1:18:40] arose
[1:18:41] now what we're dealing with here in the
[1:18:43] book of
[1:18:44] haggai
[1:18:46] here 15 years has passed now you know
[1:18:49] sometimes when we look at things
[1:18:52] sometimes we see things out here
[1:18:54] and we see this going on you know
[1:18:57] uh maybe sometimes on a plant you can
[1:18:59] see a plant well it's got wilted leaves
[1:19:01] or
[1:19:01] maybe the blossoms are not where they
[1:19:03] need to be and sometimes we we can look
[1:19:05] out there
[1:19:06] and you can look at what you see on
[1:19:08] outwardly
[1:19:10] but that really ain't the problem that's
[1:19:11] only a manifesting
[1:19:14] of a problem that's deeper
[1:19:17] so you see it this is where discernment
[1:19:20] must come in because it's not looking
[1:19:22] just on the surface
[1:19:24] but it must come there must be
[1:19:26] discernment honest reflection
[1:19:29] that which will bring in our lives to
[1:19:32] look
[1:19:32] deep into the problem to the real reason
[1:19:34] what you say what are you saying to the
[1:19:36] same i'm talking about where the people
[1:19:38] said now the time has not come
[1:19:40] this is not the time that we're to build
[1:19:42] the house of the lord
[1:19:44] now if you'd asked them 15 years ago
[1:19:47] you probably couldn't have got them to
[1:19:48] sit down
[1:19:51] man they were just i tell you what i'm
[1:19:53] one of them i'm one of hey can you pass
[1:19:55] me that brick over one of them hey can
[1:19:57] you pass me hey
[1:19:59] praise the lord i mean they were going
[1:20:00] around the circle laying that brick down
[1:20:02] the foundation right
[1:20:05] right but now
[1:20:08] there's none of that
[1:20:11] there's not there's no joy
[1:20:14] because you really can't have true joy
[1:20:17] outside
[1:20:18] of the will of god amen
[1:20:22] the real joy because joy comes from the
[1:20:25] lord amen the joy of the lord is my
[1:20:28] strength
[1:20:30] right
[1:20:31] so now let's look here just for a few
[1:20:33] moments let's look at the source of the
[1:20:36] problem
[1:20:37] in ezra chapter four verse one as this
[1:20:40] goes into this of where we were reading
[1:20:43] from hegel let's now look into the
[1:20:44] source of the problem some 15 years
[1:20:47] before that the bible says when the
[1:20:49] adversaries of judah and benjamin heard
[1:20:52] that the children of the captivity
[1:20:55] builded the temple unto the lord god of
[1:20:57] israel
[1:20:58] then came they to zerubbabel and to the
[1:21:01] chief of the fathers and said unto them
[1:21:03] let us build with you for we seek your
[1:21:07] god
[1:21:08] as you do
[1:21:10] and we do sacrifice unto him since the
[1:21:12] days of the shard and king of ashur
[1:21:14] which brought us up thither
[1:21:16] now
[1:21:19] here they are
[1:21:21] and what they've just said in verse two
[1:21:24] they're liars
[1:21:28] now i'm going to tell you this is where
[1:21:30] it comes into this time
[1:21:32] the ephesian age we have here have been
[1:21:35] restored god restoring us back to that
[1:21:37] of pentecost but i want to remember
[1:21:39] god had a great commendation for those
[1:21:42] in the ephesian age
[1:21:44] because there in that ephesian age they
[1:21:46] could stand there and somebody could try
[1:21:48] to take and say well you know paul
[1:21:50] wronged here and paul did this and there
[1:21:52] were those who stood there in that day
[1:21:54] and they flipped them straight in the
[1:21:55] face and said you're not saying what
[1:21:58] paul said amen come on friends you know
[1:22:01] what they were doing it wasn't that they
[1:22:03] were lovers of paul they loved paul they
[1:22:06] loved and respected the position that
[1:22:08] god had placed him in that they had a
[1:22:11] love for the word of god that had united
[1:22:14] and delivered their souls and they
[1:22:16] recognized that message that god had
[1:22:19] brought to them that that had given them
[1:22:22] life and it was jesus christ
[1:22:25] amen so there was a deviation
[1:22:28] they stood right there the bible says
[1:22:30] thou hast tried them who said they were
[1:22:32] apostles
[1:22:35] you know what apostles means one who is
[1:22:37] sent brother branham picks it up in
[1:22:39] scriptural signs of the time he said
[1:22:40] what we have going on is unauthorized
[1:22:43] agents
[1:22:46] how are we authorized we are authorized
[1:22:48] by the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[1:22:52] and the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:22:54] word of the living god on the inside of
[1:22:57] you and i it's the standard that god
[1:22:59] promised in this hour when the enemy
[1:23:02] comes in like a flood i the lord will
[1:23:04] raise a standard against the enemy how
[1:23:06] does he raise the standard he makes his
[1:23:09] word real what can be any more real than
[1:23:12] the living word of god coming and
[1:23:14] calling you out and changing your life
[1:23:16] and moving to the inside it's a standard
[1:23:18] that stands right there against the
[1:23:20] enemy
[1:23:22] lord
[1:23:24] but these guys were liars
[1:23:28] here look how they come hey let us help
[1:23:31] let us build with you
[1:23:33] let us
[1:23:36] you know we're not careful with that
[1:23:37] where's the christian attitude in this
[1:23:41] come on friends this is why we need
[1:23:42] discernment of spirit
[1:23:45] because there's things sometimes that
[1:23:47] with that right there we could take a
[1:23:48] litany of scripture and say where's the
[1:23:50] christian spirit here where's this
[1:23:51] listen
[1:23:52] there's discernment of spirit taking
[1:23:54] place right here
[1:23:56] you know what's giving them discernment
[1:23:57] what's giving zerubbabel in them
[1:23:59] discernment the word that they're
[1:24:01] feeding on amen
[1:24:02] the bible tells us that strong meat
[1:24:04] belonging to them that are full age
[1:24:06] who have their senses exercised to
[1:24:09] deserve good from evil these men know
[1:24:11] that i mean who wouldn't want help that
[1:24:13] i mean what where they're in right now
[1:24:14] there's no walls up
[1:24:16] they've only laid down the foundation
[1:24:18] who wouldn't want help i'll tell you
[1:24:20] right now if i was doing a job at my
[1:24:21] house and one of these brothers came by
[1:24:23] and said brother samuel can i help you
[1:24:25] depending on their skills i could say
[1:24:27] sure man come on over and help me right
[1:24:30] i got more paint brushes
[1:24:33] right i mean who wouldn't want help
[1:24:36] right yes paul even would tell the
[1:24:38] church of the living god in philippians
[1:24:40] and other places to help them even they
[1:24:42] were sisters who were helping the church
[1:24:45] of the living god and as far as you know
[1:24:46] caring and things like that and paul
[1:24:48] would open a chapter i believe in
[1:24:49] chapter four in philippians he would
[1:24:51] speak again you know menace give to them
[1:24:53] because they are helping the body who
[1:24:55] wouldn't want to be helped
[1:24:59] sometimes the help
[1:25:01] that comes as help is not really help
[1:25:08] praise the lord
[1:25:10] one now we can go this in a natural
[1:25:12] there's some people you've had over to
[1:25:13] help you you wish you hadn't called them
[1:25:17] see in the natural it kind of helps
[1:25:20] right there's some things that usually
[1:25:21] you know hey brother god bless you i'll
[1:25:23] see you on thursday
[1:25:27] honest confession
[1:25:28] [Laughter]
[1:25:32] but seriously though
[1:25:34] these were individuals they didn't
[1:25:35] worship the only true and living god
[1:25:37] they worship idols too
[1:25:40] you see where they were standing is we
[1:25:42] don't want no mixture in here
[1:25:45] we want to stand with the pure purpose
[1:25:48] and word of god that's been revealed to
[1:25:50] us i'm telling you there was discernment
[1:25:52] that they had in that hour discernment
[1:25:54] notice jerubalau and jeshua the the rest
[1:25:58] of the chief the fathers of israel said
[1:25:59] unto them you have nothing to do with us
[1:26:02] to build a house unto our god but we
[1:26:05] ourselves together will build unto the
[1:26:08] lord god of israel as king cyrus the
[1:26:10] king of persia hath commanded us i'm
[1:26:12] telling you god doesn't need a lot right
[1:26:15] god don't need numbers he needs
[1:26:17] surrendered hearts
[1:26:20] brother madam tells us over and over and
[1:26:21] we see it scripturally all the way down
[1:26:23] through the scriptures it wasn't a big
[1:26:25] army that gideon god used it was one man
[1:26:29] surrendered to the hand of god and there
[1:26:31] was just a hundreds of soldiers that was
[1:26:34] there following that word i'm telling
[1:26:36] you they beat back the midian that's why
[1:26:38] because they were under the anointing of
[1:26:41] the spirit of almighty god and that's
[1:26:44] why god could say through his prophet
[1:26:46] that you take one man on fire for god
[1:26:48] it'll do more for the church than having
[1:26:50] ten revivals
[1:26:53] come on
[1:26:55] oh i say god let that revival strike in
[1:26:58] me lord rekindle the fire lord in my
[1:27:01] life rekindling more reigniting lord and
[1:27:05] my life about a young person you can say
[1:27:07] god let the holy ghost fall in my life
[1:27:10] let my life become a revival i'm living
[1:27:14] very tired
[1:27:20] so this discernment
[1:27:22] of spirit the bible said discern
[1:27:24] we must belove it it's a try every
[1:27:26] spirit
[1:27:28] brother brown would take us back behind
[1:27:30] that because sometimes
[1:27:31] and you look at the word honest
[1:27:33] sometimes there's what you call honest
[1:27:35] mistakes
[1:27:37] that right right we've all make them
[1:27:39] right honest mistakes but discerning the
[1:27:41] spirit that's behind it because
[1:27:43] sometimes the spirit that can be
[1:27:44] motivating does not mean that the person
[1:27:46] themselves is wrong but they're under a
[1:27:48] wrong motivation all right
[1:27:50] and that's what's got to be called out
[1:27:51] and revealed all right
[1:27:53] are you hearing me in the wrong spirit
[1:27:55] right because why you because the love
[1:27:57] of god in your heart don't want to see
[1:27:58] them go over the fall that's right are
[1:28:00] you hearing me
[1:28:02] now you understand i'm not talking about
[1:28:04] going out and calling everybody up and
[1:28:05] correcting everybody and this and that
[1:28:07] and we're the ones right and you're the
[1:28:08] ones right brother brown identified that
[1:28:10] clearly because he in an honest
[1:28:12] reflection put it before his own life
[1:28:14] and to you and i in word made flesh
[1:28:15] india trip he said i had got a selfish
[1:28:18] critical spirit about me
[1:28:23] i can follow a man like this
[1:28:25] honest reflections
[1:28:30] are you with me
[1:28:31] now ezra 4 4
[1:28:35] then the people of the land now maybe
[1:28:37] we'll draw it right up here then the
[1:28:38] people of the land
[1:28:40] weakened
[1:28:41] the hands of the people of judah
[1:28:43] weakened
[1:28:46] and troubled them in building
[1:28:50] and hired counselors remember we're
[1:28:51] getting at the calls why were they
[1:28:53] saying the time income
[1:28:55] at the same time
[1:28:57] this is the background
[1:28:59] and they hired counselors against them
[1:29:02] these are the same people that said hey
[1:29:03] let us help you
[1:29:05] they discerned that and they withstood
[1:29:07] it
[1:29:09] remember there's two parts brother
[1:29:10] braham said to discern
[1:29:12] that lukewarm formal spirit
[1:29:16] that wants to come and try to take away
[1:29:18] and discredit to the word of god
[1:29:20] amen you discern it and then withstand
[1:29:23] it amen
[1:29:25] where do we receive the strength to
[1:29:27] withstand that comes from god himself
[1:29:31] the first withstanding of it is is
[1:29:33] tune that out right there
[1:29:35] all right i tune it out right there
[1:29:39] hire counselors against them to
[1:29:42] frustrate
[1:29:44] their purpose
[1:29:47] i want you to catch this to frustrate
[1:29:49] their purpose
[1:29:51] all the days of cyrus king of persia
[1:29:53] even until the reign of darius king of
[1:29:56] of uh of persia
[1:29:58] this this this whole phrase of even
[1:30:00] before hired counselors it means to
[1:30:02] conspire
[1:30:06] satan sent some spies in
[1:30:09] jude said there were men who crept in
[1:30:10] unawares men of corrupt minds
[1:30:15] are you with me they crept in
[1:30:17] turning the grace of god into
[1:30:18] lasciviousness
[1:30:20] is that right right
[1:30:22] it's also paul said how can two walk
[1:30:24] together unless they be agreed
[1:30:29] amen
[1:30:31] amen unless they be agreed
[1:30:34] we're going the same way
[1:30:36] hallelujah is that all right amen
[1:30:40] like you can stand like joshua as a
[1:30:42] husband and has a father
[1:30:44] stand as a pastor as for me and my house
[1:30:48] we're going to serve the lord
[1:30:50] we're going to believe this message
[1:30:51] we're going to preach this message we're
[1:30:53] going to live this message we're going
[1:30:55] to be this message and we're going in a
[1:30:57] rapture
[1:30:58] [Applause]
[1:31:00] hallelujah amen
[1:31:02] and they hired counselors to conspire
[1:31:06] against them you know brother brandon
[1:31:08] tells us when you just to think of this
[1:31:09] in the message here brother adam would
[1:31:11] tell us in in um christ the mystery of
[1:31:14] god revealed
[1:31:15] how satan won't let you stay a big happy
[1:31:18] group of people
[1:31:20] then he also tells us in humble thyself
[1:31:23] he said i want you to remember he said
[1:31:25] satan will try to get among you
[1:31:28] he said he's got every gun trained
[1:31:30] against you
[1:31:32] right he said he'll call somebody to
[1:31:34] rise up and do something that's wrong or
[1:31:36] you think that's wrong he said but
[1:31:38] remember you ask god to stay with
[1:31:40] sweetness in your heart and you pray for
[1:31:42] that individual amen
[1:31:45] is that right right
[1:31:47] it's between them and god whether they
[1:31:48] turn around or not
[1:31:51] is that right we understand that there
[1:31:52] are stands that we have to take on the
[1:31:54] word of god
[1:31:56] now i want you to look at this here to
[1:31:57] frustrate their purpose
[1:31:59] this word frustrate means to break it
[1:32:04] to come to an end
[1:32:06] the motive and the objective of these
[1:32:09] counselors coming in was to break their
[1:32:12] purpose in other words stop the work
[1:32:16] if we can just get the work stopped
[1:32:20] you mean you don't want them to go back
[1:32:21] to babylon no
[1:32:23] if we can just get them to where they're
[1:32:25] so discouraged that they stopped
[1:32:27] laboring
[1:32:29] i'm good with that
[1:32:30] you mean you don't matter if they just
[1:32:32] come to church no long as they just
[1:32:34] they're they're not real fervent i'm all
[1:32:36] right with that
[1:32:37] come on friends we're talking about
[1:32:39] honest reflection you mean you're all
[1:32:41] right if they just say they believe the
[1:32:43] message i'm all right with that
[1:32:46] right
[1:32:48] you mean you're okay
[1:32:50] if they're not hot yeah i mean they
[1:32:52] don't even have to be cold they can be
[1:32:53] lukewarm i'm all right with that
[1:32:58] why
[1:32:59] because
[1:33:00] the purpose of god
[1:33:03] is not being fulfilled through the lives
[1:33:06] of these people all right
[1:33:09] so satan conspired let me tell you
[1:33:11] something satan studies each of our
[1:33:12] lives
[1:33:14] and and listen this guy works overtime
[1:33:17] you might think you've had to work some
[1:33:18] 12 well he works more than 12.
[1:33:22] i might think i've studied some
[1:33:23] all-nighters he does more than that
[1:33:25] i know the bible speaks of our lord he
[1:33:27] neither slumbers nor sleeps but the
[1:33:29] enemy is continually scheming and
[1:33:32] working in our life let me say this he
[1:33:34] knows our makeup
[1:33:37] he knows how we're made up he knows what
[1:33:39] pushes our buttons come on friends
[1:33:41] the baptism of the holy ghost in your
[1:33:44] soul it gives you victory it gives you
[1:33:46] authority but you've got to reign over
[1:33:48] that outer man
[1:33:50] and recognize him he is your biggest
[1:33:53] enemy
[1:33:54] your opposition that's right that's true
[1:33:59] amen
[1:34:01] think of this to break the purpose
[1:34:03] to cause it to come to an end
[1:34:05] sometimes the way these counselors come
[1:34:07] in now these guys didn't come in all
[1:34:08] together you know like
[1:34:10] you know like a parade
[1:34:12] hey
[1:34:12] we're here to upset the apple cart
[1:34:15] we're here to disrupt everything
[1:34:17] we're here to turn it all over
[1:34:19] we're here to stop everything going on
[1:34:21] your life
[1:34:22] satan comes in
[1:34:24] clothed in innocence that's right that's
[1:34:27] right he started his ride
[1:34:29] on a white horse
[1:34:31] innocency
[1:34:34] james picks that up
[1:34:36] when it deals with uh sin and lust and
[1:34:38] desires and then eventually it's crowned
[1:34:41] he deals with the four horse riders
[1:34:42] there we see that in our own life must
[1:34:45] discern it in our own homes
[1:34:48] must discern it right here in the church
[1:34:50] yes
[1:34:52] because th that that the horse riders
[1:34:55] there of revelation remember the cover
[1:34:57] has been taken off of satan satan's
[1:35:00] desire is to make the church of the
[1:35:03] living god lukewarm cold and powerless
[1:35:07] i don't know about you i am not settling
[1:35:10] for just being a part of a church i'm
[1:35:14] not settling for just rallying around
[1:35:16] and saying we believe a message i
[1:35:18] believe in this hour i'm a part of this
[1:35:22] message this message was sent to be
[1:35:25] manifested and take upon flesh in this
[1:35:28] hour amen
[1:35:31] and that's why because of that pull in
[1:35:34] our life it's more than us just saying
[1:35:36] that but our saying of that it causes us
[1:35:38] to get before the word and ask god's
[1:35:41] church my heart lord
[1:35:44] search me out real good
[1:35:46] god help me to have an honest reflection
[1:35:49] help me when the word exposes something
[1:35:52] help me to say amen to the word even if
[1:35:55] it takes the heart off of me if i'm not
[1:35:57] where i should be lord let me say amen
[1:36:00] to the word
[1:36:02] and in fact the word to change me
[1:36:08] oh my
[1:36:10] this is why
[1:36:12] i want you to listen to this quote i'm
[1:36:14] i'm not going to be too much longer here
[1:36:21] christ the mystery of god revealed i
[1:36:22] don't have this but i want you just to
[1:36:24] listen
[1:36:25] brother bran says this mystery
[1:36:28] is revealed only as he promised to his
[1:36:30] bride
[1:36:32] matthew 16 you're aware of that
[1:36:35] hell
[1:36:36] is against this truth
[1:36:38] of the revelation of this mystery
[1:36:44] but the bride is standing on it and
[1:36:46] that's her stand amen
[1:36:48] amen
[1:36:49] that's my stand amen
[1:36:51] is this revelation of jesus christ
[1:36:54] this mystery of god
[1:36:56] that has been revealed this mystery of
[1:36:58] god the true baptism of the holy ghost
[1:37:02] this word living behind badger skins
[1:37:05] this is our stand amen amen
[1:37:09] our stand is not church membership our
[1:37:12] stand is not just agreeing around god
[1:37:14] sent a prophet well i believe every word
[1:37:16] our stand is upon the revelation of that
[1:37:19] mystery burning in the hearts and lives
[1:37:22] of god's children is that where you
[1:37:24] stand as a father is that where you
[1:37:26] stand as a husband is that where you
[1:37:28] stand as a mama where you're not just
[1:37:30] gonna settle for well you know they're
[1:37:32] going along with things they're doing
[1:37:33] the commandments just right it ought to
[1:37:35] burn in your heart and if it doesn't
[1:37:37] maybe you need a burning bush experience
[1:37:40] you need the power of god in your life
[1:37:42] maybe you need it rekindled in your life
[1:37:44] because what is needed is a real
[1:37:47] experience with god
[1:37:49] where the word becomes flesh and it's a
[1:37:52] stand
[1:37:53] amen against everything amen the enemy
[1:37:56] wants to rise up you've got a strength
[1:37:58] to stand against it
[1:38:04] praise the lord
[1:38:07] i want you to understand this here when
[1:38:09] i preach it i'm looking at the mirror
[1:38:11] too
[1:38:12] brother john when i'm studying and god's
[1:38:14] dropping things all through the week and
[1:38:16] then things as things are putting
[1:38:17] together little by little there's
[1:38:18] examinations going on in my life i'm not
[1:38:20] looking these are not just wealth let me
[1:38:23] find something to preach no
[1:38:25] i want my life examined
[1:38:28] and i just wanted to examine many times
[1:38:31] i have to crawl right out of my desk
[1:38:32] chair get right down on the floor many
[1:38:35] times even right there in praying
[1:38:37] beforehand and the spirit of god begins
[1:38:39] to strike upon certain things i want to
[1:38:41] see and know him more amen amen
[1:38:45] understand i'm not a sinner you're not a
[1:38:47] sinner but we want to know him more amen

[1:38:53] help me show me more more of me needs to
[1:38:56] be emptied out
[1:38:58] right
[1:39:00] notice
[1:39:01] what brother brahman says this i want
[1:39:02] you to think of this
[1:39:04] counselors that have been hired
[1:39:09] it goes on to say in christ the mystery
[1:39:11] says why do you hunger church
[1:39:14] why do you thirst
[1:39:16] it's the father trying to reveal this
[1:39:18] hidden secret to you
[1:39:21] but you let so many things get it out of
[1:39:24] you
[1:39:25] now i want you to notice what he's
[1:39:26] saying all hell was against it are you
[1:39:29] hearing me now
[1:39:30] the first part of the quote all hell's
[1:39:31] against it
[1:39:33] but now when it comes down he says you
[1:39:35] let so many things get it out of me you
[1:39:37] know it shows hell has no
[1:39:40] power
[1:39:42] unless we give it to him
[1:39:45] what are you saying brother sam well you
[1:39:47] can't stop the thoughts from coming in
[1:39:49] right but you can load up the double
[1:39:51] barrel and scene
[1:39:55] you can't stop them from coming
[1:39:57] but you can stand against it
[1:40:02] discerning against it discerning them

[1:40:18] you you let your job and we got to work
[1:40:21] right right
[1:40:22] the bible says no man don't work you
[1:40:24] don't eat
[1:40:25] you let you let your wife
[1:40:27] you let your husband
[1:40:29] you let your children
[1:40:31] you let the cares of the world
[1:40:33] you let some pastor
[1:40:35] you let somebody else get that out of
[1:40:36] you
[1:40:37] when you know that way down in your
[1:40:39] heart you're thirsting
[1:40:41] and hungry hallelujah it's god trying to
[1:40:44] reveal it to you see the revelation the
[1:40:47] last day is here
[1:40:49] now friends i'm a great believer in this
[1:40:51] just how the holy spirit would take his
[1:40:52] word and you've witnessed it over the
[1:40:54] years not just here not just from myself
[1:40:56] but from every gifted man of god you
[1:40:59] look and when i look at this right here
[1:41:00] of what is stated here
[1:41:02] within the message i don't just apply
[1:41:04] this quote and say oh once we're born
[1:41:06] again now nothing's going to get it out
[1:41:07] of us no
[1:41:09] i look at this quote right here as this
[1:41:11] is a continual
[1:41:12] standing that we must take hell is
[1:41:15] against this revelation
[1:41:19] hell really don't want your job but if
[1:41:21] hell can do it it'll cause your job to
[1:41:24] take away from this revelation
[1:41:27] come on friends i'm not going to say
[1:41:28] hell don't want your children but the
[1:41:30] real objective is hell will try to use
[1:41:33] those things to come against this
[1:41:35] mystery
[1:41:36] we are not ignorant of satan's devices
[1:41:41] that don't mean we throw our children to
[1:41:43] the curb absolutely not but we we we
[1:41:46] moving this way come with me and serve
[1:41:49] almighty god
[1:41:51] amen god is the first in our life god is
[1:41:54] the theme of our home everything
[1:41:56] revolves around him amen
[1:41:58] amen what is doing that is the stand of
[1:42:01] the mystery of god in the heart of the
[1:42:03] believer when hale wants to approach the
[1:42:06] doors of our children the doors of our
[1:42:08] home we stand on that mystery of a
[1:42:11] living reality called applying the token
[1:42:14] with love and confidence and says satan
[1:42:16] you can't have them well if you don't
[1:42:18] let them do this you can't have them
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:21] you can't have them
[1:42:24] it's the stand of the revelation because
[1:42:26] that revelation is prevailing power
[1:42:32] shane wants to try to get authority over
[1:42:34] you he wants to try to get power over
[1:42:37] you
[1:42:38] amen come on friends the devil's not a
[1:42:40] dummy
[1:42:44] oh brother samuel i'm a pretty smart guy
[1:42:46] he's smarter than you and he's smarter
[1:42:48] than me
[1:42:49] matter of fact we can put all of our
[1:42:50] brains together and he's still smarter
[1:42:51] than us
[1:42:53] come on friends
[1:42:54] well i know the word he knows the word
[1:42:56] too
[1:42:57] as a matter of fact he believes that
[1:42:59] jesus christ is the son of god but he
[1:43:01] trembles
[1:43:04] but the difference between the devil and
[1:43:05] me the difference between the devil and
[1:43:07] you is i believe it and i have received
[1:43:10] the holy ghost
[1:43:16] i'm not just talking about a letter i
[1:43:19] know who i am i know and whom i have
[1:43:22] believed that i am persuaded that he is
[1:43:24] able to keep that which i have committed
[1:43:27] unto him against today
[1:43:35] i'm telling this would be a good quote
[1:43:36] to cut out and put on your refrigerator
[1:43:38] put on your phone when you when your
[1:43:40] phone you look at your phone how the
[1:43:42] hell wants to make its approach
[1:43:45] against your life
[1:43:52] as a young person hell wants to make its
[1:43:54] approach against your life
[1:43:56] satan ain't interested in you
[1:43:59] he's not interested in bettering your
[1:44:00] life right you're right that's right he
[1:44:02] don't have nothing to offer you
[1:44:04] the only thing he wants to paint
[1:44:06] something out here like a mirage of oh
[1:44:08] i've got this to offer you and oh my you
[1:44:10] can you can have this and you can have
[1:44:12] that and remember all he has to offer is
[1:44:15] mirages
[1:44:17] it leaves lives hungry empty scarred
[1:44:21] bound with sin amen
[1:44:24] that ain't love that's somebody who
[1:44:26] hates you
[1:44:28] if i came down this aisle right now and
[1:44:30] grabbed you and put you in a cage and
[1:44:32] wouldn't do nothing for you you would
[1:44:33] say that guy don't love me why would you
[1:44:36] say it because of the way i'm treating
[1:44:38] you let me tell you something the devil
[1:44:40] he treats you so bad and yet you would
[1:44:42] want to serve him what about a loving
[1:44:45] god whether he don't put you in a prison
[1:44:48] you were following the reason but this
[1:44:50] god come down to set you free
[1:44:54] you might say i need passions i've got
[1:44:56] in my life he's a god that'll give you
[1:44:58] victory over your passions and give your
[1:45:01] strength on the inside that you have
[1:45:04] authority and dominion over them
[1:45:16] greater is he that is in you
[1:45:19] than he that's in the world
[1:45:22] hallelujah
[1:45:23] glory be to god i tell you right now i'd
[1:45:26] open up my heart and i'll just make
[1:45:29] ready and say lord jesus fill me full of
[1:45:32] the holy ghost lord god i lay everything
[1:45:35] aside i lay it all down lord god fill me
[1:45:38] lord with the purpose of the living god
[1:45:44] hallelujah

[1:46:07] morning
[1:46:10] i think this just feels field
[1:46:14] we let so many things
[1:46:17] get in the way
[1:46:19] we let so many things
[1:46:21] right
[1:46:21] things just you don't come out right
[1:46:23] away
[1:46:24] it just suddenly comes in
[1:46:28] brother brown put it down in the
[1:46:29] ephesian age how things can come in so
[1:46:31] subtly he said
[1:46:33] one time
[1:46:35] the things you didn't used to read now
[1:46:36] you're reading
[1:46:38] things you used to didn't watch now you
[1:46:40] watch them
[1:46:42] oh he said you used to love
[1:46:44] those meetings
[1:46:46] where the spirit of god was falling
[1:46:50] see what's happened
[1:46:52] innocently things has come in
[1:47:01] let me tell you something
[1:47:03] you or me neither one are called to make
[1:47:05] deals with the devil all right that's
[1:47:07] good we ain't making no deals with him
[1:47:09] amen
[1:47:11] pharaoh wanted to keep the children
[1:47:12] behind
[1:47:14] y'all go ahead
[1:47:16] i mean you guys want to serve god go
[1:47:18] ahead
[1:47:19] you all can be real fervent
[1:47:21] but moses standing there ah
[1:47:24] to me
[1:47:25] that's more
[1:47:27] than moses amen heart right that's the
[1:47:29] heart of god amen amen that stood right
[1:47:31] there and said
[1:47:33] we ain't going
[1:47:34] this exodus is forever amen amen
[1:47:39] my children may not be aware of it right
[1:47:41] now their understanding may not be there
[1:47:44] right now
[1:47:45] but you can't have them amen amen
[1:47:49] you can't have them devil amen let me
[1:47:51] just put the devil on notice because i
[1:47:53] put him on notice many times you can't
[1:47:55] have our young people
[1:47:59] look sammy you pray that i pray that
[1:48:01] absolutely cause i know that he can hear
[1:48:04] that but it ain't my voice it's the
[1:48:06] voice of the resurrection on the inside
[1:48:09] you can't have them amen
[1:48:11] oh they might be influenced by this and
[1:48:13] influenced by that but satan you can't
[1:48:15] have them turn the most in the name of
[1:48:17] jesus christ amen but i've got
[1:48:20] confidence in that i know the power you
[1:48:22] know the power of the of prayer and
[1:48:25] speaking the word of god brother he goes
[1:48:27] out there beyond these realms it begins
[1:48:29] to elect satan and announce to him no
[1:48:32] matter what you've tried to put before
[1:48:34] us no matter what types of things you
[1:48:36] tried to discourage us i'm looking at a
[1:48:38] promise made by a god who cannot fail he
[1:48:41] cannot fail his word can't fail and i'm
[1:48:44] united with that word so i take his word
[1:48:47] above my feelings i deny what my eyes
[1:48:50] see and i believe what my heart says is
[1:48:53] the truth i say amen to the word of god
[1:49:05] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:49:16] i think sometimes it seems so innocent
[1:49:20] the rem reads us in here a job
[1:49:24] wife
[1:49:25] husband
[1:49:27] children
[1:49:28] we have cares of the world
[1:49:30] we do i mean there's a lot of things the
[1:49:34] tax season's coming up
[1:49:36] sorry
[1:49:37] you're like i thought it was this will
[1:49:38] be
[1:49:40] encouraging i mean who who rejoices
[1:49:43] about that
[1:49:44] who rejoices about when the insurance
[1:49:46] comes due
[1:49:48] or i got to pay insurance and that now
[1:49:49] the amount of bills you got to pay that
[1:49:50] month is
[1:49:52] more than what you there's cares of life
[1:49:53] we have to do
[1:49:55] and even in the cares of the of the life
[1:49:57] that we have paul would write of it even
[1:49:59] what takes place within a family
[1:50:02] cares of this world
[1:50:04] remember paul would write
[1:50:07] we do we're to use the world
[1:50:09] without music
[1:50:14] but i think the greatest thing that we
[1:50:15] can
[1:50:17] we can do within this is say lord
[1:50:22] order my steps
[1:50:25] and let me stay close to you
[1:50:28] amen
[1:50:29] let me stay close to you
[1:50:33] can you give me the last two scriptures
[1:50:35] there and then i'm just going to read
[1:50:37] them last two scriptures who's got the
[1:50:39] slides for me
[1:50:40] ezra 4
[1:50:46] 23
[1:50:48] when the copy of our sexy's letter
[1:50:51] was read before ream and shemshine
[1:50:53] described in their companions they went
[1:50:54] up in haste
[1:50:56] to jerusalem unto the jews
[1:50:58] and made them to cease by force and
[1:51:00] power
[1:51:01] you know what they came against them
[1:51:02] with
[1:51:04] false accusations yeah that's right
[1:51:08] that's right i want you to i'm not going
[1:51:10] i'm stopping here
[1:51:12] but the false accusations had nothing to
[1:51:15] do
[1:51:16] with the orders
[1:51:17] they had originally received
[1:51:21] the false accusations had only to do
[1:51:24] with things that
[1:51:25] these guys were contriving and trying to
[1:51:28] pull out things against them in
[1:51:29] jerusalem as a rebellious city and this
[1:51:31] it had nothing to do with the original
[1:51:34] order of the word
[1:51:39] it had nothing to do with the original
[1:51:40] order of the word
[1:51:42] see what it shows to you and i our
[1:51:44] strength comes
[1:51:46] from the original order of the word
[1:51:50] from that of being restored back to the
[1:51:54] real word of god amen by the holy spirit
[1:51:58] so that everything in our life is under
[1:52:00] his control
[1:52:02] under his influence
[1:52:04] they came up and made him deceased by
[1:52:06] force
[1:52:07] and by power
[1:52:11] and i thought i thought these were
[1:52:14] these were the people of god i thought
[1:52:16] they were moved by the power of god they
[1:52:18] were
[1:52:19] but somewhere along the line
[1:52:23] their hands were weakened
[1:52:26] and they got weakened
[1:52:28] and
[1:52:28] weakened kind of like samson when samson
[1:52:31] thought at one point you know he he just
[1:52:33] man i'll be able to rise up the next
[1:52:35] time and just throw these philistines on
[1:52:39] man i'll be able to
[1:52:40] what was samson doing
[1:52:43] he was relying
[1:52:44] on a past
[1:52:46] experience
[1:52:49] a past
[1:52:51] reputation
[1:52:54] but it's what we are
[1:52:56] now that matters amen amen
[1:53:01] it's what we are now that matters
[1:53:04] and here they were they had become
[1:53:06] weakened then the bible says in verse 24
[1:53:09] then ceased
[1:53:11] the work of the house of god
[1:53:13] which is at
[1:53:14] jerusalem
[1:53:16] imagine
[1:53:18] things that was being
[1:53:20] laboring
[1:53:22] they were working
[1:53:24] my i mean it was just such a thrill in
[1:53:27] the midst of god fulfilling his word
[1:53:30] was a thrill
[1:53:32] i mean
[1:53:34] they actually look forward to getting up
[1:53:35] in the morning
[1:53:37] getting started with their day
[1:53:39] going through them
[1:53:41] you know this is what god has called us
[1:53:42] they were so
[1:53:44] occupied
[1:53:46] with what god had called them to do
[1:53:51] they still sowed their crops
[1:53:53] they still ate
[1:53:55] but that wasn't their focus
[1:53:57] their focus was
[1:54:00] of what god had called them to do all
[1:54:02] right that's right that's good
[1:54:04] that's our victory right there
[1:54:08] and satan knows if i can get their focus
[1:54:10] away from
[1:54:12] and the priorities changed
[1:54:14] i'll weaken them
[1:54:17] devil don't you don't you care i mean go
[1:54:19] do they got to go back out in the world
[1:54:21] no no
[1:54:22] as long as they get
[1:54:24] cooled down
[1:54:26] as long as it's just
[1:54:27] it's kind of going around long what do
[1:54:29] you mean well you know kind of like
[1:54:31] where everything kind of becomes just
[1:54:32] like a
[1:54:33] like a club
[1:54:37] oh
[1:54:38] that don't bother you no
[1:54:41] because let me remind you and i
[1:54:44] we are a temple
[1:54:45] of the holy ghost amen
[1:54:48] we are built up spiritually as a
[1:54:50] habitation of god through the spirit
[1:54:53] there's to be added to our lives growing
[1:54:56] up
[1:54:57] in the stature of a perfect man
[1:55:00] spirit of god moving down in our life
[1:55:06] this is where we say god
[1:55:10] now is the time
[1:55:12] now is the time right now
[1:55:15] the mirror the mirror shows the
[1:55:18] mouth
[1:55:21] i have memories of when we had hair but
[1:55:27] we have memories right brother brian all
[1:55:30] got right
[1:55:32] all right brother rocco we got memories
[1:55:34] brother ritchie right

[1:55:43] i got pictures
[1:55:44] but the mirror's not a picture
[1:55:47] the mirror shows what's going on

[1:58:25] sinner you're an unbeliever
[1:58:27] for many no doubt you had an experience
[1:58:29] with god
[1:58:33] but things that can come about where you
[1:58:35] find yourself not as fervent

[1:58:41] and you would ask the lord father
[1:58:46] help me lord jesus

[1:59:23] spirit of the living god
[1:59:27] lord
[1:59:28] jesus we need it lord for our own lives
[1:59:34] what god is you see fit you would give
[1:59:36] it for this situation or that situation
[1:59:38] but lord i'm speaking and lord also on
[1:59:41] behalf of my brothers and sisters for
