[39:29] Lord in the further part of the service
[39:32] now in the name of Jesus Christ amen as
[39:38] you turn into Matthew 26 I want to just
[39:45] two things I'd like to remind you of is
[39:48] this coming week just to remind you that
[39:51] this coming week on Thursday we will not
[39:54] be having service here on Thursday
[39:56] because of the I now want to give you
[39:59] the opportunity to take care of whatever
[40:00] you need to because Saturday next
[40:03] Saturday and next Sunday the Lord
[40:05] willing brother Jeff Snodgrass will be
[40:07] here with us
[40:08] on those in those dates Saturday I
[40:11] believe is at six o'clock and then
[40:13] Sunday at at eleven so also the
[40:19] fellowship dinner right after the
[40:21] service this morning at North ins Depot
[40:24] if you're able to make it would
[40:25] certainly would love to be able to sit
[40:27] down into the fellowship with you and so
[40:30] we we certainly thank God for these
[40:32] times and opportunities I also wanted to
[40:37] convey to you I know next week Lord
[40:39] willing we'll be lifting the mission
[40:42] offering as usual and there's also a
[40:45] project that I had mentioned to you when
[40:47] I came back from the Philippines and
[40:49] brother Roel after I had been
[40:50] corresponding with him
[40:51] they have just let me know of it and
[40:54] that is they're in need of the boat and
[40:57] the boat was there's a boat that was
[40:59] actually damaged in the storm that they
[41:02] had had
[41:03] back in the late fall I think it was
[41:06] back in right after brother Jerry and I
[41:07] had got back and the the boat that many
[41:12] of the things that you realize when I
[41:13] tried to show you that on the on the the
[41:16] overheads is that that Philippines
[41:19] itself is just comprised of I don't know
[41:21] how many thousands of islands and so you
[41:25] know there's there's certain transit
[41:27] that they can take but it's a lot it's a
[41:30] lot more efficient to be able to move by
[41:33] boat and right now the the cost because
[41:36] they've got the brothers to be able to
[41:38] do this that boat and it's a boat like
[41:40] what you had seen that I was I was
[41:43] riding in and the cost of that to do
[41:45] that is right at $1,400 US dollars and
[41:49] so brother lol had just reached out to
[41:51] us and and I had wanted to to know that
[41:54] because when they're going from the
[41:55] place island to island there's brothers
[41:57] right now and what they're doing they're
[41:59] walking that when they go to the island
[42:01] they'll walk they'll go over the
[42:03] mountain and they'll just walk so it's
[42:04] not like they're not doing things now
[42:06] it's just to try to make it a little bit
[42:09] more efficient because there are needs
[42:10] that are there from the mystery expose
[42:13] where you've had congregations that have
[42:15] come to the Lord and they have just they
[42:19] have been struggling to get to them to
[42:22] baptize them in the name of the Lord
[42:24] Jesus Christ and they want to further
[42:26] take the congregations on in the
[42:29] teaching of the word so there's a
[42:31] there's a need to be able to to get
[42:34] there to them so there's a brother OA
[42:35] has actually trained some brothers to
[42:37] where that they can they can go out and
[42:39] take care of that but he just had
[42:42] brought that to me so I would asked you
[42:43] if you just pray about that and and then
[42:45] Lord willing next Sunday will just take
[42:48] up a mission offering and I really just
[42:51] kind of want a thrust maybe to be
[42:53] towards that so that we can help out
[42:55] that that need as well so it's good to
[42:59] be here in
[43:00] be here it's good to be in the presence
[43:02] of the Lord and so thankful we had good
[43:04] weather to come to church to me the
[43:08] other day you know the other day you
[43:10] know when we can't left out of here and
[43:12] we got to driving on the roads I was I
[43:14] was rejoicing I told I told them my boys
[43:17] one of my boys was riding with me on the
[43:18] way home I said you look at this and the
[43:20] temperature I said stayed right at 32
[43:21] and you know just slushie on the roads
[43:24] but I'm thankful that God kept his hand
[43:27] on us amen and so and you know
[43:31] Zachary he met me in the office after
[43:34] service boy he really enjoyed that
[43:35] service so dad you preached really short
[43:38] today and so I thought I'd tease him a
[43:44] little bit I said don't worry I'll make
[43:45] up for it on Sunday he was really he
[43:49] really enjoyed that service I mean it
[43:53] little as much when God is in it I
[43:57] thought that was really really cute you
[44:00] know amen
[44:02] Matthew 26 verse 26 and as they were
[44:09] eating Jesus took bread and blessed it
[44:13] and brake it and gave it to the
[44:15] disciples and said take eat this is my
[44:19] body and he took the cup and gave thanks
[44:22] and gave it to them saying drink you all
[44:25] of it but this is my blood of the New
[44:29] Testament which is shed for many for the
[44:32] remission of sins but I say unto you I
[44:35] will not drink henceforth of this fruit
[44:38] of the vine until the day when I drink
[44:41] it new with you in my father's Kingdom
[44:44] what a promise that we have and a
[44:48] promise to look forward to amen the same
[44:53] victory that it brought forth in his
[44:56] life is the same victory
[44:58] that it's bringing forth in our life
[45:00] when we sat there that day across from
[45:03] one another at the wedding supper of the
[45:05] Lamb and here we are partaking of this
[45:10] of this communion what a testimony it
[45:13] will be
[45:14] we will set there and the testimony will
[45:17] be by His grace by your life or by your
[45:22] strength or by your word that you sent
[45:25] Lord in season Lord o mighty talking
[45:29] about a time of worship amen
[45:32] let's let's let you be seated in the
[45:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'd
[45:37] like to speak to you this morning on the
[45:40] issuing in the New Testament issuing in
[45:45] the New Testament many times we see it
[45:51] just in our Bibles that's given and we
[45:54] we commonly refer to it an Old Testament
[45:59] and New Testament in two books and yet
[46:02] we we recognize that without the Old
[46:06] Testament there would not be a New
[46:09] Testament but that the New Testament
[46:11] itself was actually the mystery that was
[46:16] hidden within the old many many shadows
[46:19] and many types that were laying there
[46:21] but a testament in itself is is a
[46:25] disposition or it's an arrangement it's
[46:27] a covenant it's a compact it's a will
[46:30] that one would declare like of their
[46:33] your last Testament and last will so
[46:36] what is what is there it's wrote in it's
[46:39] written out and like a person would go
[46:41] and have a will drawn up and when you
[46:43] have that will drawn up you have all of
[46:45] the wishes and things that are to be
[46:48] declared within there and who gets what
[46:51] and this one gets this and this one gets
[46:53] that and you know do that in those wills
[46:56] they can't put down in the little title
[46:57] sighs and no fighting and those no
[47:00] fussing and but in this Testament there
[47:02] is that but in in that in in the
[47:05] Testament that that when we look at just
[47:08] the will itself is is where that once a
[47:12] person you know as long as grandma or
[47:14] grandpa whoever may have been given you
[47:16] a a great heirloom of furniture but you
[47:18] can't have it until they've died because
[47:22] when they die then what is written now
[47:24] comes into for
[47:26] so there's there's a need for there to
[47:29] be a death that what is written then can
[47:32] come forth in force to those into whom
[47:35] it is intended to so the New Testament
[47:38] itself it is the fulfilling of the
[47:41] Covenant that and promise that God had
[47:44] made and confirmed unto Abraham and this
[47:48] is where I just want to draw some of
[47:50] these parts here this morning if we go
[47:52] back in the scripture into Luke chapter
[47:54] 1 verse 67 we find here Zacharias the
[47:58] father of John and it says and Zacharias
[48:01] was filled with the Holy Ghost and
[48:03] prophesied saying blessed be the Lord
[48:06] God of Israel for he hath visited and
[48:09] redeemed his people and hath raised up
[48:11] in horn of salvation for us in the house
[48:13] of his servant David as he spake by the
[48:17] mouth of his holy prophets which have
[48:19] been since the world began that we
[48:22] should be saved from our enemies and
[48:24] from the hand of all that hate us to
[48:27] perform the mercy promised to our
[48:30] fathers and to remember his holy
[48:32] Covenant the oath which he sware to our
[48:37] father Abraham aren't you glad that God
[48:39] has not forgotten
[48:42] God has not forgot his promise that he
[48:47] would grant unto us that we being
[48:49] delivered out of the hand of our enemies
[48:50] might serve him without fear in holiness
[48:54] and righteousness before him all the
[48:58] days of our life we find that how that
[49:02] the Lord Jesus when he was standing here
[49:06] he was calling the attention of the
[49:09] religious the Pharisees and the
[49:11] Sadducees he was pointing to them
[49:14] regarding the Scriptures and how that
[49:16] they themselves though reading the
[49:19] scripture and those seeming to believe
[49:21] it yet they did not believe it they what
[49:24] they believed was and where there where
[49:26] their worship rested was not in the word
[49:30] but their worship rested within the
[49:33] traditions that they had made out of the
[49:36] word but God
[49:38] has nor will he ever receive warship
[49:41] through a tradition because his warship
[49:45] he only receives warship through that
[49:48] place where he has chosen to place his
[49:51] name so it will always be according to
[49:54] his character and I believe that's why
[49:56] that the character of Christ when we
[49:58] look at it and we can have all of the
[50:01] word but if we miss the character we've
[50:03] missed everything because the character
[50:06] is the very life it's the very person
[50:09] that makes the word live and yet you
[50:12] find that here among men that we could
[50:15] look at like Peter and Peter you know
[50:17] how brother branham described that he
[50:18] couldn't have wrote read his name if it
[50:21] had been wrote on a boxcar and it was
[50:24] kind of letting us know within it even
[50:26] how that when they had come Peter and
[50:28] John remember how they had come before
[50:30] the men in that day and been taken
[50:32] captive and the Bible said they took
[50:34] knowledge that these men were ignorant
[50:36] and unlearned so there wasn't anything
[50:39] they could they couldn't hide their
[50:40] ignorance and their unlearning but there
[50:42] was something about it that when the
[50:44] prophecy and promise begin to come to
[50:47] pass you know Peter had a daddy that
[50:50] would tell him about the promise and we
[50:52] know that there had to be something
[50:54] different to where that that where that
[50:56] he was communicating the promise that's
[50:59] the same way it was with with siming in
[51:02] the same way with Anna and I I believe
[51:03] with all my heart that friends that it's
[51:05] God that releases that that part of his
[51:09] word is releasing when that word is to
[51:12] be fulfilled it's gonna be fulfilled by
[51:14] God himself
[51:15] so it takes God moving ahead upon the
[51:18] hearts of the people God as always and
[51:21] God will have a people that are always
[51:24] prepared and ready for the fulfillment
[51:27] of the word it's not it's not something
[51:29] that it's based on our knowledge but
[51:31] it's things that where it's just
[51:33] something that resonates within our
[51:35] hearts it's something that even though
[51:37] we can't explain it but it's just
[51:38] something that brings us to an awareness
[51:41] and to an alertness in this hour and
[51:43] this is where that they were not being
[51:46] learned people but they could say we
[51:48] have found him
[51:49] who Moses and the prophets have spoke of
[51:51] and and all of those things that would
[51:53] be expressed they caught the witness
[51:55] just like the woman at the well who her
[51:58] her life in itself was not a life that
[52:00] any of them would have sat down and
[52:02] talked to with and fellowship with but
[52:04] yet there was something about it that
[52:06] she had a confidence by looking at the
[52:09] word and say we know that when Messiah
[52:11] cometh he will tell us these things so
[52:15] there was things that there was already
[52:17] showing that in the midst of everything
[52:20] that there is a people that God himself
[52:23] has prepared and they are the people of
[52:25] his choosing the people that God himself
[52:28] has already that is the designation that
[52:31] he's going to make himself known to yet
[52:33] he walked among all of them he walked
[52:36] right down through their temple he
[52:39] walked right down through their schools
[52:41] he stood there and he talked with him so
[52:43] it wasn't something that was done in a
[52:46] corner it was done openly so what is it
[52:49] it's showing that God Himself is not
[52:52] trying to be secretive but God Himself
[52:55] declares his word and his promise openly
[52:59] but there that promise is declared
[53:02] because God is fulfilling his word and
[53:04] there are people that are identified
[53:07] when that promise is made manifest they
[53:10] themselves are brought from death unto
[53:13] life that promise holds within it the
[53:17] very catalyst or key stone that brings
[53:21] them forth and so when we find that how
[53:24] that in the scriptures here you find how
[53:27] that even where a Peter you'll find
[53:29] Steven speaking of it of where that even
[53:32] Peter would would would speak to those
[53:35] who were gathered around after what had
[53:38] taken place on the day of Pentecost and
[53:40] and remember when Peter stood out there
[53:42] here he is in the midst of this time
[53:44] speaking to the Pharisees and these
[53:47] people in this time he's letting them
[53:48] know that you are the children of the
[53:51] prophets another covenant that God made
[53:53] unto our fathers and he lets him know
[53:55] unto you first God raised up his son
[53:58] Jesus and sent him to bless
[54:01] now watch this here's sent him to bless
[54:03] you in turning away every one of you
[54:06] from his iniquities but you see they did
[54:10] not need that blessing that's what they
[54:15] thought we don't need to be turned from
[54:18] our iniquities what do you mean in
[54:21] bondage we ain't never been in bondage
[54:24] then you look at this you see where you
[54:27] find Peter you find the woman at the
[54:29] well you find that the disciples here
[54:31] they were and those that had been
[54:33] looking Simeon and Anna all those here
[54:36] they were they were looking at the
[54:38] coming of the Lord the Messiah has a
[54:41] need it was what they had need us but
[54:46] here you find the religious and that day
[54:48] that's not what they were looking for
[54:50] they were not looking for something that
[54:53] they had need of they believed they had
[54:55] it all together but they needed the
[54:59] blessing and the blessing they needed
[55:01] was they needed to be turned away from
[55:03] their iniquities I tell you what that's
[55:06] the blessing that God gives that's a
[55:07] real blessing
[55:08] that's the real blessing in spiritual
[55:11] places that removes a life from the
[55:13] iniquity because you see the word was
[55:17] pointing out these things I remember as
[55:19] Peter stood here on the day of Pentecost
[55:21] you know the Prophet tells us over and
[55:22] over when Peter stood there and he's
[55:24] speaking to them right here at the end
[55:26] of Acts 3 the Bible says right after he
[55:29] said these things that the Pharisees in
[55:31] them rose up and begin to come against
[55:33] him and right there when Peter was
[55:35] preaching this message there was an
[55:37] issuing of an indictment upon that
[55:40] generation is that right but yet notice
[55:43] the mercy of God here is an indictment
[55:45] against that religious institution but
[55:48] the mercy of God gave a space of time
[55:51] before the Gentile ages started and here
[55:54] was an issue a mercy that was given to
[55:57] where eventually we find what even the
[55:59] Lord Jesus prophesied regarding that of
[56:02] remember to flee pray that your flight
[56:05] be not in the winter time there was an
[56:07] issuing that
[56:08] where that that Jerusalem was going to
[56:10] be taken and gonna be be gonna be
[56:12] brought captive and all of that was
[56:14] pronounced there in here Peter himself
[56:16] is issuing an indictment and after Paul
[56:19] himself standing there and the Jews
[56:21] rising up against the ministering of the
[56:23] work they weren't rising up against Paul
[56:26] they were rising up against Jesus Christ
[56:28] that's what they were against they were
[56:30] against the fulfilment of the work the
[56:33] very thing that they all have been
[56:34] claiming to the very thing that they
[56:36] ought to be rejoicing it was the very
[56:38] thing they were despising the very thing
[56:41] that could set them free was the very
[56:43] thing that they didn't want and here as
[56:47] Paul would say in the word though
[56:50] because you judge yourselves unworthy
[56:56] see God didn't judge them know they
[56:58] judge themselves unworthy low we turned
[57:02] from the Jews unto the Gentiles God gave
[57:07] a space of grace so after the indictment
[57:11] there is a space of grace amen there's
[57:15] been an indictment there was an
[57:16] indictment of this nation now right then
[57:20] the indictment fell upon the church the
[57:22] organizational system is that right but
[57:25] inside of that remember how the Prophet
[57:28] stands there they met at the end of the
[57:30] message indictment he says God be
[57:32] merciful because there's individuals so
[57:35] now what did it do it turns to the end
[57:37] of the lady OC and aids there in
[57:39] Revelations 3 2 where he's outside of
[57:41] the church knocking on the door and
[57:44] what's he doing he's calling his
[57:45] children out of there it's a space of
[57:49] grace that is given so here we are in
[57:55] this time because the Jews themselves
[57:57] you see while we are in a time a
[58:00] preparation is coming for us in rapture
[58:03] the Jews have already been gathering
[58:06] back to the homeland the only thing
[58:08] that's needed is for us to step out of
[58:11] the way and as soon as we step out of
[58:13] the way the inspiration falls upon those
[58:16] two witnesses and then will they begin
[58:18] to proclaim the same gospel that you
[58:21] I have been embraced and brought into
[58:24] Christ by that's all they're doing
[58:26] they're waiting there at their posts and
[58:29] all it all it is is God removing the
[58:32] Gentile bride out of the way so I look
[58:35] at these things here how that Paul would
[58:37] say regarding the the Jews in Romans 9
[58:41] I'm just trying to lay this as a
[58:42] background here he says I say the truth
[58:45] in Christ and I lie not my conscience
[58:47] also bearing me witness and the Holy
[58:49] Ghost but I have great heaviness and
[58:52] continual sorrow in my heart for I could
[58:55] wish that myself were accursed from
[58:57] Christ for my brethren my kinsmen
[59:00] according to the flesh you see Paul's
[59:03] desire look now look at this he was one
[59:05] that remember when before God had got
[59:08] ahold of his life he was one that was
[59:11] going and making havoc of the Church of
[59:14] the Living God remember he's one that
[59:16] was we could say making fun of he did
[59:19] not see it but it just goes to show that
[59:21] you take an elective God and no matter
[59:24] where they're at and no matter what they
[59:26] think they might say things or
[59:28] fanaticism and everything else but you
[59:30] let him get into the presence of the
[59:32] light you let him get in the presence of
[59:34] Jesus Christ one time he's able to take
[59:37] a skeptic and make a real believer out
[59:39] of them because down on the inside
[59:41] here's a real seat of God oh how the
[59:44] Prophet said many times he said I've
[59:46] seen skeptics and seen those that would
[59:48] laugh at meetings like this and make fun
[59:50] of them but yet he said you get him in
[59:52] the presence of God he said God will
[59:54] turn him around and take something that
[59:56] you you and I would have said there's no
[59:58] hope for him but God reaches down
[1:00:00] because why there's something down there
[1:00:03] [Applause]
[1:00:07] hallelujah no right nobody all just
[1:00:10] lives the life get it up to you or me to
[1:00:14] put nobody out just live the life we're
[1:00:21] going to send you you don't know what
[1:00:22] they said but listen just live the life
[1:00:25] don't respond how they are you don't
[1:00:29] gotta argue with them you don't got to
[1:00:31] be defensive the gospel defends itself
[1:00:34] it'll defend itself by the life it
[1:00:36] produces through you hallelujah because
[1:00:40] what they may not hear in stop up their
[1:00:42] ears but yet there's a witness of a life
[1:00:45] that's being expressed that they've got
[1:00:47] to take knowledge that you've been with
[1:00:50] Jesus Paul said in this and here in
[1:00:56] Romans 9 for who are Israelites to whom
[1:01:01] pertaineth the adoption and the glory
[1:01:04] and the covenants and the giving of the
[1:01:07] law and the service of God and the
[1:01:10] promises whose are the fathers and of
[1:01:13] whom as concerning the flesh Christ came
[1:01:16] who is over all God blessed forever amen
[1:01:20] now we recognize that Jesus Christ would
[1:01:24] neither Jew nor Gentile but he had to
[1:01:27] come through that promise of the word
[1:01:30] back through the house of David through
[1:01:33] that of Judah he would come forth but it
[1:01:36] could not be that of a blood cell that
[1:01:40] was already here but God created both
[1:01:43] sperm and egg God created a blood cell
[1:01:47] that he himself might come and and
[1:01:50] establish a tabernacle whereby he might
[1:01:53] redeem you and I back to himself all
[1:01:57] God's doing he came the Bible says it he
[1:02:00] came to his own his own what those who
[1:02:04] were after the flesh those who were of
[1:02:06] the house of Israel he came to them but
[1:02:10] they didn't receive him you see friends
[1:02:12] this is where it's very very very very
[1:02:15] important the word can come you know I
[1:02:19] can preach my heart out and a minister
[1:02:21] can preach his heart out brother bream
[1:02:22] says he can preach to his blue in the
[1:02:24] face he said but it will do you no good
[1:02:25] unless you believe it you've got to
[1:02:29] believe the word that's coming forth
[1:02:31] you've got to receive that word and
[1:02:34] unless the word take preeminence in your
[1:02:37] life it does no good I've been being
[1:02:39] able just to hear it but it's got to be
[1:02:40] received because the authority of the
[1:02:43] word remember the
[1:02:44] as a gentleman it's the person it's
[1:02:47] Jesus Christ
[1:02:48] he'll never override your will no sir
[1:02:52] he don't do that that's not surrender
[1:02:54] that's called dictatorship but surrender
[1:02:57] as he draws you into a place of
[1:02:59] surrender it's like a person won the
[1:03:03] holy ghost and they say well you know
[1:03:04] God
[1:03:05] I need you to give me the Holy Ghost so
[1:03:07] I can quit doing this and quit doing
[1:03:08] that
[1:03:09] you got a surrender God's not gonna come
[1:03:11] and fulfill what's not surrendered it's
[1:03:14] gotta be a surrender vessel to him and
[1:03:17] he Woo's you by his spirit to where he
[1:03:21] comes into a place of submission that he
[1:03:24] can place his life and his seal in you
[1:03:33] as many as received him to them gave he
[1:03:38] the authority to become the sons of God
[1:03:42] he's the quicken of the word I want you
[1:03:47] to think of this here as Paul has went
[1:03:49] through this in Romans nine paul paulie
[1:03:51] interjects throughout the book of Romans
[1:03:53] man I love the book of Romans I love the
[1:03:56] whole Bible but I look at this within
[1:03:58] the book of Romans and you find how Paul
[1:04:00] is so careful in the book of Romans to
[1:04:02] remind us as Gentiles from whence we
[1:04:07] have come he's mindful to do that
[1:04:10] because pride is a nasty thing you know
[1:04:15] brother Branham was speaking to a person
[1:04:16] on the prayer line and he said sister he
[1:04:19] said you were healed one time in your
[1:04:20] body he said but you got a little hotty
[1:04:23] with that testimony and God allowed the
[1:04:25] sickness to return so haughtiness and
[1:04:28] pride God doesn't like it at all and
[1:04:30] this is where Paul is letting it be
[1:04:32] known hey we got to be mindful of the
[1:04:35] grace that has come to you and I hear we
[1:04:39] look at this in Romans 11 verse 25
[1:04:42] Paul said I would not brethren that you
[1:04:45] should be ignorant of this mystery this
[1:04:49] mystery
[1:04:51] lest you should buy by wise in your own
[1:04:54] conceits that blindness in part has
[1:04:57] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[1:05:00] the Gentiles be come in so the blindness
[1:05:05] here to Israel we understand that it
[1:05:07] wasn't God forcibly blinding them but it
[1:05:10] was that they themselves were actually
[1:05:13] their heart waxed gross they actually
[1:05:15] turned their heart they stopped up their
[1:05:17] ears the Bible says in the book of
[1:05:18] Zechariah their heart became as adamant
[1:05:21] stone and we understand that wanted what
[1:05:24] it was is here that even when God was
[1:05:26] trying to call them back in line and
[1:05:29] back into the word but yet they would
[1:05:31] refuse to hear what God was saying but
[1:05:34] they gave preeminence to their
[1:05:36] traditions and to their Creed's they
[1:05:38] gave that preeminence to where that
[1:05:41] their heart became that of waxed gross
[1:05:43] or calloused or having like that part of
[1:05:46] fat around it to where God was not able
[1:05:49] to move that wasn't it was like a
[1:05:50] chamber of the heart that was damaged
[1:05:53] and it could no longer get in the
[1:05:55] circulation of the blood that takes the
[1:05:57] nutrients and the life it was no longer
[1:05:59] moving the way that it ought to be
[1:06:01] because the tradition had clogged it up
[1:06:03] and it separated them from the life line
[1:06:06] but here's the mystery of it they are
[1:06:08] blinded until the fullness of the
[1:06:12] Gentiles be come in I believe were there
[1:06:15] I believe we're there the fullness of
[1:06:19] the Gentiles be come in notice verse 26
[1:06:23] and so all Israel shall be saved
[1:06:26] well who's all Israel the Israel of God
[1:06:30] not every single person who can declare
[1:06:32] I'm a Jew is going to be safe but there
[1:06:36] is an Israel that God has had in his
[1:06:40] mind 144,000 those that will be there
[1:06:44] God had them in his mind God knew
[1:06:46] exactly where they would be he knew
[1:06:49] exactly the dispersion that would take
[1:06:51] place in the land whatever country
[1:06:53] wherever they would be at but God by His
[1:06:56] Spirit would move upon the hearts to
[1:06:58] ensure if it wasn't
[1:07:00] returning it was their parents returning
[1:07:03] and here they are born in the land God
[1:07:04] himself
[1:07:05] is overseeing everything to bring in in
[1:07:08] position all my brother and sister that
[1:07:10] ought to give you an eye such a rest and
[1:07:13] a consolation such a trust it ought to
[1:07:16] be something to listen a rest and a
[1:07:18] consolation doesn't mean we don't pray
[1:07:20] for the fulfillment of it know we can
[1:07:22] pray for the fulfillment of God's Word
[1:07:25] when God has given a promise in his word
[1:07:28] then you and I ought to take that and
[1:07:30] pray about that and say well you know
[1:07:32] it's going to happen anyhow but your
[1:07:34] prayer is designated in declaring your
[1:07:37] faith and your desire to see this word
[1:07:40] fulfilled hallelujah amen so all Israel
[1:07:46] shall be saved as it is written there
[1:07:50] shall come out of Zion the deliverer and
[1:07:53] shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob
[1:07:56] for this is my covenant unto them when I
[1:08:01] shall take away their sins God God made
[1:08:08] a promise he's going to visit him he's
[1:08:12] going to purify the sons of Levi he's
[1:08:15] gonna purify like silver and gold he's
[1:08:18] gonna take them from when they're
[1:08:19] offering up on all of those sacrifices
[1:08:22] that are pointing to the true atonement
[1:08:24] and then that that by him revealing
[1:08:27] himself to his brethren how that the
[1:08:29] prophets there will be their notice how
[1:08:31] that Elijah would be there in Moses what
[1:08:33] will they be doing they will be pointing
[1:08:36] out that then identifying that Christ is
[1:08:39] the fulfillment of all things who they
[1:08:43] will be there with a ministry that's
[1:08:45] four running is coming and that ministry
[1:08:50] that's four running his coming will be
[1:08:52] the ministry where they will preach the
[1:08:54] same gospel the same baptism of the Holy
[1:08:56] Ghost and they will have the hearts of
[1:08:58] the people so turned to Christ - any
[1:09:01] steps on the sea to reveal himself to
[1:09:04] his brethren they will recognize him how
[1:09:06] will they recognize him because by the
[1:09:09] revealing of the
[1:09:10] they have seen his character and they
[1:09:13] have been united with him so when he
[1:09:16] appears they will recognize him glory be
[1:09:20] to God so how is it that you and I
[1:09:23] identify Christ it's by the word Christ
[1:09:26] Himself being revealed because he is
[1:09:28] always identified by his characteristics
[1:09:34] glory be to God
[1:09:36] ma then the offering shall be acceptable
[1:09:41] unto the Lord what's this in Romans
[1:09:45] 11:28 here's where Paul says for the
[1:09:50] Jews as very speaking to the Gentiles as
[1:09:52] concerning the gospel they the Jews are
[1:09:56] enemies for your sakes enemies now
[1:10:01] remember Paul has already been dealing
[1:10:04] with things in the Galatian Church
[1:10:07] you've got individuals Paul called and
[1:10:09] false brethren is that right not saying
[1:10:12] that there weren't some who were
[1:10:13] struggling but Paul identified how that
[1:10:16] these men you say well how could Paul
[1:10:18] call and false brethren because Paul was
[1:10:20] able to identify what their motive and
[1:10:22] objective was their motive and objective
[1:10:24] was to bring glory to their ministry
[1:10:26] glory to their name they wanted to be
[1:10:29] affected by the people turning and
[1:10:31] following them so here here there were
[1:10:34] men those in that time you know we've
[1:10:36] seen the Jews as they rose up they
[1:10:38] thought the Lord Jesus himself they
[1:10:40] thought that he had come to destroy the
[1:10:42] law then they didn't they think the same
[1:10:44] way with Paul they thought Paul was
[1:10:46] against the law they're right and there
[1:10:48] were men that stood there in that time
[1:10:50] that wanted to compel Timothy and Titus
[1:10:52] to be circumcised but thank God Paul
[1:10:54] stood there and said they will not no
[1:10:57] sir we're not bowing to what your
[1:11:00] opinion is we're staying with the word
[1:11:03] aren't you glad for that
[1:11:05] we're not bowing to the opinion or
[1:11:08] tradition just because you're not
[1:11:10] walking further fully in the unfolding
[1:11:13] of the word we're not going according to
[1:11:15] this you know what that would have done
[1:11:17] weakened the faith glory be to God so
[1:11:22] notice how concerning the gospel
[1:11:24] they are enemies for your sakes but as
[1:11:27] touching the election now notice what
[1:11:30] he's speaking of the Jews but as
[1:11:32] touching the election they are beloved
[1:11:34] for the father's sake so we understand
[1:11:37] there were those who were Judaizers were
[1:11:39] coming into the church but yet where
[1:11:41] Paul was speaking of this here he's
[1:11:43] recalling the Gentiles to the grace
[1:11:45] that's been given and how that we with
[1:11:47] Thanksgiving ought to be thankful for
[1:11:50] the grace that God has shown to us
[1:11:52] because there is an elect Jew that God
[1:11:55] is going to turn to now think of this
[1:11:58] mystery how Paul wrote this here he says
[1:12:00] this mystery think of the mystery with
[1:12:03] Joseph here Joseph in his life here he
[1:12:06] is in exile he's out of envy he's he's
[1:12:09] sold and sold into slavery and then how
[1:12:12] that we understand within that mystery
[1:12:14] here while he's away that there is a
[1:12:16] Gentile bride is taken but the Gentile
[1:12:19] bride he's not just given to Joseph
[1:12:21] without there being something that is
[1:12:23] that he's done but we find that there
[1:12:25] was a need to arise to where Joseph he
[1:12:28] steps on the scene and he begins to
[1:12:30] interpret the dreams he begins to
[1:12:32] interpret the word is that right and
[1:12:35] when that takes place notice it is there
[1:12:37] were favored recognizes this ministry
[1:12:40] that hey what was spoken before
[1:12:43] concerning what this man did years ago
[1:12:45] he's still doing the same thing today
[1:12:48] and as he was doing the same thing today
[1:12:50] notice he said he gave him that of a
[1:12:53] bride I knew with me he gave him a
[1:12:56] Gentile bride so here is Joseph he's
[1:12:59] taken a bride and the Brethren don't
[1:13:01] know what's happened to him they don't
[1:13:03] know what's taking place they're still
[1:13:05] under the effects of this but God has
[1:13:07] everything in place because God even
[1:13:10] would have it declared to where when
[1:13:13] they came to Joseph it would be known
[1:13:15] that he indeed was sent ahead as a
[1:13:18] preserver of life if Joseph would have
[1:13:21] just remained there there would not have
[1:13:23] been a preserving a Gentile life and
[1:13:26] listen now if there's not because the
[1:13:28] Jews were blinded rejecting it if there
[1:13:30] is not a preserving of life one that God
[1:13:33] Himself can take residence
[1:13:36] manifest his glory then there's no
[1:13:38] return to the Jews mystery of Ruth here
[1:13:44] is Ruth season wasn't born in the land
[1:13:47] she didn't come out of the land but here
[1:13:50] Naomi and them are out of the land in
[1:13:52] exile is that right
[1:13:54] but notice how Ruth makes a way that
[1:13:58] died God shall be my god Ruth doesn't
[1:14:00] know what lays ahead but think of this
[1:14:03] now how that the Spirit of God moving
[1:14:06] there and by Ruth moving in there under
[1:14:10] the direction there is a kinsman by the
[1:14:13] name of Bo ass remember
[1:14:14] Naomi herself she was in need of a
[1:14:17] kinsman but it was Ruth herself that she
[1:14:20] had sent out and Ruth through that
[1:14:22] kinsman through Boaz she was redeemed or
[1:14:26] taken there unto unto Boaz and then
[1:14:29] through that seed of life
[1:14:31] Boaz gives to her a child a son and that
[1:14:35] son has been given to Naomi and they
[1:14:38] only becomes a nourisher of that child
[1:14:40] is that right the Bible said he shall be
[1:14:43] a restorer of thy life his very gospel
[1:14:48] that came to the to battle Ruth and
[1:14:50] mystery it returns right back through
[1:14:53] from the Gentile right back to the Jew
[1:14:56] again the little book not of Naomi
[1:15:00] it's the Book of Ruth for chapters there
[1:15:07] were four riders of death but there's
[1:15:09] four riders of life well here with me
[1:15:13] this book of Ruth Oh My glory be to God
[1:15:17] so to think of it of how that with this
[1:15:20] design let me just dwell on this a
[1:15:21] moment here because the Bible said that
[1:15:23] that Zion out of Zion shall come to
[1:15:26] deliverer and shall turn away
[1:15:27] ungodliness from Jacob so we noticed
[1:15:31] this Zion when we look at this in the
[1:15:32] scripture that Zion itself Zion being a
[1:15:36] type of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:39] remember when David is coming here into
[1:15:42] a place to to take you know the the land
[1:15:44] there or coming to Jerusalem that there
[1:15:47] were Jeb your sites at that time who
[1:15:49] were
[1:15:49] in there and remember these guys were
[1:15:51] still under Confederate they had come
[1:15:53] there but under the pact that Joshua and
[1:15:54] them had made there with some you with
[1:15:56] me
[1:15:57] but notice what these guys say - -
[1:16:00] concerning - David they say you can come
[1:16:02] in here but you can't bring any lame
[1:16:04] blind or halt in here what a condition
[1:16:10] to meet but David David sends up and he
[1:16:15] says let it be the one who will get up
[1:16:18] and get the city and he said let him
[1:16:20] smite him and let him smart the lame
[1:16:22] halting black we're in there because let
[1:16:25] him not say that David can not bring in
[1:16:28] the late lame the Halton blind you know
[1:16:29] that speaking of you and me there was a
[1:16:33] dinner there was a separate that was
[1:16:34] prepared for when the Christ Himself
[1:16:37] came but that Jewish Church said we're
[1:16:40] not gonna come to your supper we got all
[1:16:42] kinds of excuses and all kinds of
[1:16:44] reasons and he said go out there in the
[1:16:47] highways and the byways and call the
[1:16:49] lane the hole and the blind let me tell
[1:16:52] you something
[1:16:53] he is the fountain that is Oakland in
[1:16:56] the house of David I'm gonna tell you
[1:17:01] something
[1:17:01] a person comes into him lame they don't
[1:17:04] walk out lame they might come and blind
[1:17:07] the eyes come open my walk in hope but
[1:17:12] they come out home why they're coming in
[1:17:16] with David who are David the anointed
[1:17:19] king who is this The Anointed Messiah
[1:17:23] whoa hallelujah
[1:17:28] no wonder the scripture would speak oh
[1:17:31] that salvation of Israel work come out
[1:17:35] of Zion when the Lord bring us back the
[1:17:39] captivity of his people Jacob shall
[1:17:41] rejoice and Israel shall be glad ala
[1:17:45] we're out of Zion and the bride
[1:17:50] Amen that Childress glory out of Zion
[1:17:57] oh my out of Zion how that it says is
[1:18:01] the perfection of beauty God has shined
[1:18:06] he is our light you with me this word
[1:18:12] this life taking residency in your life
[1:18:15] it's in this right here is in this word
[1:18:18] itself taking a whole and how the notice
[1:18:22] here how that God has been collecting
[1:18:24] his subjects down through the Gentile
[1:18:26] ages what's he been doing he's been
[1:18:28] collecting all of those whose names are
[1:18:30] written in Zion and what's he doing
[1:18:33] building up Zion a man and he's in here
[1:18:36] he is he's issuing forth life itself is
[1:18:39] coming out of Zion glory be to God there
[1:18:45] is beauty coming out of Zion what beauty
[1:18:47] is it it's not the beauty of man it's
[1:18:50] the beauty of his own life a beauty that
[1:18:53] the world despises but it's a beauty of
[1:18:56] his own character not us but him it's
[1:19:03] him it's his life shining through it's
[1:19:09] him bringing all things to a perfection
[1:19:11] out of our life this is this is the
[1:19:14] promise that he made in Joel the Lord
[1:19:17] shall roar forth out of Zion oh yes sir
[1:19:21] this is not an event coming this is the
[1:19:23] Lord roaring out of Zion this is his
[1:19:25] life hey man those seven thunders hear
[1:19:28] when those seven seals were open and the
[1:19:31] Bible said that he sounded and when he
[1:19:33] sounded there it was seven thunders of
[1:19:35] roar
[1:19:35] brother and sister those voices they did
[1:19:38] not stay out there but that same life
[1:19:40] that same voice is now sounding in the
[1:19:43] bride of Jesus Christ don't you realize
[1:19:46] the word itself
[1:19:47] it's coming to a maturity and a
[1:19:49] perfection it is not going to be our
[1:19:51] voice that calls them out of the grave
[1:19:53] but it is the voice of the resurrection
[1:19:56] the manifestation and ripening of the
[1:19:58] promise that will bring about the
[1:20:01] resurrection
[1:20:02] [Music]
[1:20:03] hallelujah Quinn the fulfillment of the
[1:20:06] promise of the Messiah what happened it
[1:20:09] had to give way and they arose with him
[1:20:11] in his rapture glory be to God
[1:20:16] hallelujah out of Zion you know friends
[1:20:18] where this puts it it's a god what a
[1:20:20] responsibility but you know it's not the
[1:20:23] responsibility that we have to perform
[1:20:25] it where we're not the performers we are
[1:20:28] simply vessels vessels that are given
[1:20:34] now what if you went into your house
[1:20:36] today maybe you're real thirsty and you
[1:20:38] went into your house and it just so
[1:20:40] happens that that here you are out
[1:20:42] working or doing something and you have
[1:20:44] a need for a drink and you come back
[1:20:46] into the house and you realize you open
[1:20:48] up the cabinets oh there's no vessels oh
[1:20:52] no oh forgot to run the dishwasher maybe
[1:21:02] there's plastic cups God don't want
[1:21:03] temporary vessels maybe their staff from
[1:21:07] God don't want temporary vessels are you
[1:21:09] with me god no one disposable Christians
[1:21:12] he wants a vessel that he can use a
[1:21:16] vessel meaning that we in our lives are
[1:21:19] so present and living our lives that
[1:21:21] whenever that he would want to use us if
[1:21:24] he would want to use us were available
[1:21:26] but it's enough just to be ready be
[1:21:30] ready stay ready but what's this how
[1:21:36] Paul brings us here in Ephesians chapter
[1:21:40] 2 wherefore remember remember that ye
[1:21:48] being in time past Gentiles in the flesh
[1:21:54] Gentiles we're not in the soul in the
[1:21:57] flesh who are called uncircumcision by
[1:22:03] that which is called the circumcision in
[1:22:06] the flesh made by hands that at that
[1:22:09] time ye were without Christ being aliens
[1:22:13] from the Commonwealth
[1:22:15] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[1:22:17] from the covenants of promise having no
[1:22:21] hope without God in the world let me
[1:22:26] remind you even how the disciples
[1:22:28] themselves looked at the syrophoenician
[1:22:30] woman she was a Greek a Gentile
[1:22:36] stop bugging him and the Lord Jesus
[1:22:41] himself what did he call her a dog it's
[1:22:48] just like the word when the word has
[1:22:50] struck across our pathway and calls us a
[1:22:52] dog but yet there's something down
[1:22:54] beneath that it says he's talking to me
[1:22:56] true Lord you see what it is there's
[1:22:59] something beneath that that's able to
[1:23:01] submit itself what is that it's not the
[1:23:04] Greek the Greeks are all in learning and
[1:23:06] all puffed up but it shows that among
[1:23:08] all that could be so learned but if
[1:23:10] there is something beneath that that's
[1:23:12] able to humble itself to the presence of
[1:23:15] God God will come and meet that need for
[1:23:21] when she said that's true Lord that
[1:23:26] release to her who he was to her glory
[1:23:32] be to God think of it she had no hope
[1:23:35] coming to him that way she knew it was
[1:23:40] knew what he was able to do but she
[1:23:42] didn't have a hope right here within the
[1:23:48] covenants the adoptions all of those
[1:23:50] that were pertaining who was it
[1:23:53] pertaining to Israel as far as spoken
[1:23:56] over them but the mystery within it was
[1:24:00] the Gentile but now all glory but now in
[1:24:07] Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far
[1:24:11] off are made nigh by the blood of Christ
[1:24:14] but now in not believing on in Christ
[1:24:19] Jesus baptized in to Jesus Christ are
[1:24:24] made nigh by the blood so when we look
[1:24:28] at this
[1:24:29] new testament the issuing in of this new
[1:24:32] testament the new testament church is
[1:24:35] none other than the bride of Jesus
[1:24:37] Christ it is that of his sovereign
[1:24:42] election and choosing those that he's
[1:24:45] already had be greed in the will or
[1:24:48] testament that was before the foundation
[1:24:51] of the world he chose us in Christ
[1:24:54] remember has the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:24:56] read in our opening text he said drink
[1:24:58] of this cup for in this cup is the blood
[1:25:01] of the New Testament what was it it was
[1:25:04] the life of the New Testament who is
[1:25:06] that Christ so now the the issuing in of
[1:25:11] this New Testament now let's just move
[1:25:14] ahead here just for a little bit this
[1:25:15] morning and look at this in Hebrews
[1:25:17] chapter 8 verse 6 the Bible is speaking
[1:25:20] now sitting setting the difference
[1:25:22] between that of the erotic or Levitical
[1:25:24] priesthood and that of the priesthood us
[1:25:26] after the order of Melchizedek and he
[1:25:29] begins Paul is separating the difference
[1:25:31] between the sacrifices that they have
[1:25:33] offered which could not make anybody
[1:25:35] perfect but now through him by this one
[1:25:38] this great high priest this holy one
[1:25:41] undefiled the one who became us by his
[1:25:43] life he now is able to offer up and he's
[1:25:47] able to perfect and bring forth what is
[1:25:50] necessary but now hath he obtained a
[1:25:56] more excellent ministry notice I places
[1:26:00] this here it didn't say that that the
[1:26:03] vertical priesthood and that were there
[1:26:05] that it wasn't a good ministry it was
[1:26:07] only a shadow and a type but now this is
[1:26:13] the excellent ministry because through
[1:26:14] this this is a ministry that Excel if it
[1:26:18] can do what the Levitical priesthood
[1:26:21] could never ever do but how much also he
[1:26:26] is the mediator of a better covenant
[1:26:30] watch these words which was established
[1:26:35] upon better promises so this better
[1:26:38] covenant this New Testament is not
[1:26:40] something that's new it's what was
[1:26:43] established before but now is coming to
[1:26:48] view glory verse seven for if that first
[1:26:53] covenant had been faultless none watch
[1:26:55] how Paul breaks on this if that first
[1:26:57] covenant had been faultless then shed no
[1:27:00] place have been sought for the second
[1:27:02] the first covenant that Paul is speaking
[1:27:05] of here is this covenant of where the
[1:27:07] law itself enters for finding fault with
[1:27:12] them
[1:27:13] there wasn't any Fault in the law the
[1:27:16] law was good the law was holy
[1:27:18] the law is spiritual come on so it
[1:27:21] wasn't any fault with the law because
[1:27:23] the law itself is God's own nature
[1:27:26] scribed into stone but God didn't want
[1:27:32] it the objective is not that it would
[1:27:34] become ascribed in stone but that it
[1:27:39] would be upon the tables of the heart
[1:27:40] but do you see how it was when the Lord
[1:27:43] Jesus came it was inscribed on stony
[1:27:46] hearts you with me they didn't have
[1:27:50] mercy for nobody laughs no sir they
[1:27:54] didn't have time for nobody if it's not
[1:27:58] according to how I see it in my eyes at
[1:27:59] all that's where it was what was it it
[1:28:02] was the law written upon stony hearts
[1:28:05] well was it bondage they were still in
[1:28:08] bondage they didn't know they needed to
[1:28:11] be free they were right there the way
[1:28:13] they were going about it showed the
[1:28:14] fault he finding fault with them he said
[1:28:18] behold the days come saith the Lord when
[1:28:21] I make a new covenant notice when I will
[1:28:24] make a new covenant with the house of
[1:28:26] Israel at the house of Judah he found
[1:28:29] fault but look what he did
[1:28:30] look at his promises he found fault
[1:28:33] fault with what not the law but for with
[1:28:36] what that nature that was within them
[1:28:39] the heart was not right but he's most
[1:28:41] not condemning them he said because of
[1:28:44] this I will make a new covenant can't
[1:28:48] you see where God Himself barriers they
[1:28:51] need the people couldn't help themselves
[1:28:53] you and I couldn't help ourselves but
[1:28:56] not himself he knows what you and I had
[1:28:58] need of that's his grace not according
[1:29:06] to the Covenant that I made with their
[1:29:07] fathers in the day when I took them by
[1:29:09] the hand to lead them out of the land of
[1:29:11] egypt because they continued not in my
[1:29:14] covenant and i regarded them not saith
[1:29:16] the lord for this is the covenant that i
[1:29:18] will make with the house of israel after
[1:29:20] those days saith the lord i will put my
[1:29:22] laws into their mind i will write them
[1:29:25] in their hearts and I will be to them a
[1:29:27] god and they shall be to me a people and
[1:29:29] they shall not teach every man his
[1:29:31] neighbor and every man his brother
[1:29:33] saying know the Lord for all shall know
[1:29:35] me from the least to the greatest no
[1:29:39] respecter person the Holy Ghost and the
[1:29:43] Holy Ghost only recognizes royalty and
[1:29:46] that royalty is the royal seed of
[1:29:49] Abraham it doesn't matter what your
[1:29:51] status is in life and no matter how high
[1:29:54] you are or how low you are it does not
[1:29:57] matter about status what it looks at is
[1:29:59] that seed that's there when he came to
[1:30:02] the woman at the well oh my she had a
[1:30:05] visitation that day where she had the
[1:30:08] Old Testament prophecies and the Lord
[1:30:11] Jesus brought the match that was needed
[1:30:14] and what did it do it changed her life
[1:30:18] he did what she could have never done
[1:30:24] for I will be merciful to their
[1:30:27] unrighteousness and their sins and their
[1:30:35] iniquities
[1:30:35] well I remember no more in that he saith
[1:30:44] a new covenant he hath made the first
[1:30:49] old him that he saith a new covenant he
[1:30:55] hath made the first old now that which
[1:30:59] decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
[1:31:02] vanish away a new covenant a new
[1:31:06] testament yet if we take it just by
[1:31:09] or words that we use new it would seem
[1:31:12] like that this is a covenant that has
[1:31:14] never been before but yet this is a
[1:31:16] covenant that's already been spoken of
[1:31:18] it was a covenant that's traveled clear
[1:31:21] from the mind of God and God has given
[1:31:24] little glimpses of it down through time
[1:31:27] as a matter of fact when it has come to
[1:31:29] the fulfillment of this covenant there
[1:31:31] has always been an exodus an exodus
[1:31:35] comes to confirm and bring forth what is
[1:31:39] in this covenant it came down there in
[1:31:41] Egypt what was it it was a token that
[1:31:43] was ministered in that time then you
[1:31:45] find how that there was a longevity of
[1:31:47] time and how that the people themselves
[1:31:49] work everything got accumulated but here
[1:31:51] came the Lord Jesus in that time here he
[1:31:54] stands to minister the Covenant to
[1:31:56] Israel what comes forth out of that a
[1:31:58] token in that time there's a second
[1:32:00] Exodus leading from Judea Judaism into
[1:32:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now
[1:32:05] after the Gentile age the fullness of
[1:32:08] the Gentiles it's coming to a place now
[1:32:10] to where now has the son of man himself
[1:32:13] standing and revealing himself oh my in
[1:32:16] the lives of the people of God in this
[1:32:18] hour there is the token of the Holy
[1:32:21] Ghost that's given in this hour amen our
[1:32:24] token that whereby in this hour the
[1:32:26] third Exodus where we are promised a
[1:32:29] deliverance and that deliverance has
[1:32:31] already started in the hearts of God's
[1:32:33] people we've been delivered from
[1:32:36] traditions delivered from Creed's
[1:32:38] deliver from dogmas and because of that
[1:32:42] deliverance there's a life giver on the
[1:32:44] inside that will not allow a tradition
[1:32:46] to remain if our thinking is wrong he'll
[1:32:49] override it
[1:32:50] oh my he's throwing it all down this new
[1:32:55] covenant was was established was
[1:33:00] established on better promises look how
[1:33:06] this fault that he had found with them
[1:33:09] this fault was as though Israel could go
[1:33:14] about and could do the law think of how
[1:33:16] David said David you know that David
[1:33:18] himself he loved he loved the law of the
[1:33:21] Lord David David
[1:33:23] according to that that ability that was
[1:33:25] given in that time the Holy Ghost would
[1:33:27] come upon him and it would pull back and
[1:33:29] it would come just like the prophets he
[1:33:30] would come upon him and it would pull
[1:33:32] back is that right the Holy Ghost would
[1:33:34] come on and would pull back but you see
[1:33:36] when the Bible here was the declaration
[1:33:38] of the Messiah the visitation of the Son
[1:33:40] of man was is that when you shall see
[1:33:42] him descend from heaven and on whom he
[1:33:45] remaineth not cometh and goeth not
[1:33:48] cometh and God know who remaineth this
[1:33:52] son the same is he Oh glory so it's not
[1:33:57] a coming and a going an up and a down
[1:33:58] and an up going down but now within this
[1:34:04] here
[1:34:04] remember David remember what David said
[1:34:06] he said Allah put your word as frontlets
[1:34:08] on my eyes and I've put your word in my
[1:34:11] heart that I might not sin against you
[1:34:12] all those things are wonderful and David
[1:34:14] meant there was always heart
[1:34:15] those are things that at that time David
[1:34:17] did according to what the strength and
[1:34:19] everything of a man could do according
[1:34:22] to what God had released him in that
[1:34:23] time but that still itself no matter how
[1:34:26] good a person could be because remember
[1:34:28] you couldn't put a finger upon the lives
[1:34:30] of these men but looking down into the
[1:34:32] depths of their lives there was still a
[1:34:34] fault that was there and that fault was
[1:34:36] there was a fault that they had been
[1:34:38] born under and they had to be delivered
[1:34:41] of that first birth no matter who
[1:34:44] they're dead in no matter who their mama
[1:34:45] was they had to be delivered of that
[1:34:48] first birth and there's only one that
[1:34:50] could deliver them from the first birth
[1:34:52] there had to be one that would become
[1:34:54] one of us that would be born of a virgin
[1:34:58] no repeater God
[1:35:00] God had to had to get himself a son back
[1:35:03] God had to God had to get himself a
[1:35:06] tabernacle a temple a vessel alive but
[1:35:10] surrendered heart and so notice when the
[1:35:12] Lord Jesus comes a prophecy that rings
[1:35:15] out in Psalm Zo's I did like to do that
[1:35:17] will Oh God
[1:35:18] my law is within my heart it wasn't just
[1:35:22] something out here it wasn't just
[1:35:24] something here but it was here it was
[1:35:27] lived out righteousness was being lived
[1:35:31] out and expressed through this vessel
[1:35:34] now notice this
[1:35:36] need for mediator this need for a
[1:35:40] mediator let me just work with this just
[1:35:43] a few moments here because this covenant
[1:35:46] the Bible says here that we read in in
[1:35:48] Hebrews Paul mentions in multiple times
[1:35:50] the word mediator it was also that that
[1:35:53] Jesus Christ Himself being the mediator
[1:35:56] of this better covenant of this new
[1:35:59] covenant this new covenant that was
[1:36:01] established upon better promises now
[1:36:05] what's this in the scripture here him we
[1:36:07] look at what a mediator you know when
[1:36:10] you have a mediator it's somebody who is
[1:36:12] a go-between somebody that there's a
[1:36:16] begins there's a tie there's a tie that
[1:36:19] other tie the two together there's got
[1:36:22] to be somebody who can come to that can
[1:36:24] that can actually move to actually
[1:36:26] intervene between two right a mediator
[1:36:32] must come in order to to bring about
[1:36:34] there's a there's a there's a joining
[1:36:36] together or a compact or a contract
[1:36:39] that's that's to be entered into it
[1:36:41] requires a mediator to be there so
[1:36:44] there's a need for a mediator here is
[1:36:47] God's desire and knowing that everything
[1:36:50] that God has spoken but yet there's got
[1:36:51] to be a mediator there there's got to be
[1:36:54] one who can come and put his hands on
[1:36:57] sinful man and on a holy God and bridge
[1:37:01] the gap there's got to be one that can
[1:37:03] do that and so God Himself he sends a
[1:37:07] messenger before his face as I write and
[1:37:09] here John the Baptist his ministry is
[1:37:12] pointing out behold he cometh the Lamb
[1:37:15] of God here is one that's going to come
[1:37:17] that is take away the sins of the world
[1:37:19] John was so sure of that you know why
[1:37:22] because God had revealed it and it was
[1:37:25] according to the promise
[1:37:26] think of John himself as he stood there
[1:37:29] in that time and and the word was so
[1:37:31] alive to him that John could identify
[1:37:34] himself his place in the scripture there
[1:37:37] John was standing with divine authority
[1:37:39] by the word that had been revealed at
[1:37:42] him in that hour and here John was
[1:37:44] letting it be known behold the lamb of
[1:37:46] God who taketh away the sin of the
[1:37:48] world his ministry began to cry out he's
[1:37:52] among you he's among you there's one
[1:37:54] among you now John's ministry was a
[1:37:59] ministry that could identify he is now
[1:38:02] here who is the one who could stand as a
[1:38:08] mediator the one who can stand in the
[1:38:11] breach Oh glory be to God
[1:38:16] why is willing to be known that there is
[1:38:18] one that's able to remove the curse
[1:38:21] that's able to remove the fault that's
[1:38:23] able to deal with the problem Malachi 3
[1:38:29] verse 1 behold I will send my messenger
[1:38:34] then he shall prepare the way before me
[1:38:38] remember what John when we looked at
[1:38:40] that some weeks and weeks ago when John
[1:38:43] came John came to people he came to
[1:38:47] people to be Bible readers we could say
[1:38:49] that day they had the message of Moses
[1:38:51] when he came to him they said us repent
[1:38:53] what are you talking about we don't need
[1:38:56] to repent you see what 1 look this is
[1:38:59] not this was not what the word what God
[1:39:01] intended the law to do the law or the
[1:39:04] word was never given to puff somebody up
[1:39:08] so they weren't walking in the true
[1:39:10] meaning of it they had become so
[1:39:13] inflated in themselves too they see no
[1:39:16] need to repent dear god what a sorry
[1:39:20] condition Lord keep us from that keep us
[1:39:25] humble Lord whoa brother Samuel that's
[1:39:28] just given that's a haughty spirit right
[1:39:29] there it's not just given every day of
[1:39:32] our life we've got to make a decision to
[1:39:34] be humble let me tell you something
[1:39:37] friends Cain was humble you know that I
[1:39:42] preached that here the Prophet tells us
[1:39:43] Kane himself humbled himself before God
[1:39:47] but he could not humble himself to the
[1:39:49] degree that Abel could how could Abel
[1:39:53] humble himself to that degree because it
[1:39:55] was in him to recognize the word and
[1:39:58] submit to it
[1:40:00] what the word was calling for so
[1:40:03] everybody in this earth can be humble
[1:40:08] but what it matters is are we humble to
[1:40:11] him is it humility to him I'm so
[1:40:16] thankful that even when our pride can
[1:40:18] get in the way I'll say our pride that
[1:40:20] the Spirit of God can go to dealing with
[1:40:22] our life and begin to speak to us in
[1:40:24] such a way and we say Oh Lord forgive me
[1:40:26] because you realize pride it's not just
[1:40:28] things that we do pride it's not just
[1:40:30] things that we say pride is sometimes
[1:40:32] the way you think all you would never
[1:40:36] say it out but can they do stuff like
[1:40:39] this you never say it out but you think
[1:40:42] it and remember by your thoughts you
[1:40:44] create an atmosphere what a
[1:40:48] responsibility recognizing the grace
[1:40:51] that's given notice now the Lord noticed
[1:40:53] this promise and the Lord whom you seek
[1:40:56] shall suddenly come to his temple even
[1:41:01] the messenger of the Covenant whom he
[1:41:05] delighted he's the author he's the
[1:41:11] messenger of the Covenant so here you
[1:41:13] have John's ministry going forth but now
[1:41:16] and the Lord the Lord whom you seek
[1:41:19] shall suddenly come to his temple even
[1:41:23] the messenger of the Covenant in whom
[1:41:26] you delight in now we know that in that
[1:41:29] day that there were those who did
[1:41:31] delight in him when he made himself
[1:41:35] known to them the messenger of the
[1:41:37] Covenant in Christ they delighted in him
[1:41:40] is that right but then we find that
[1:41:43] there were those that did not delight in
[1:41:46] the messenger of the Covenant this
[1:41:48] messenger of the Covenant none other
[1:41:50] than Christ himself God are you with me
[1:41:54] the messenger of the Covenant now think
[1:41:56] of this here is the messenger of the
[1:41:58] Covenant what covenant that covenant
[1:42:00] that was before the foundation of the
[1:42:02] world that covenant that issued in to
[1:42:05] Abraham here he comes as the messenger
[1:42:08] of the Covenant the same one that was
[1:42:11] with them in the church in the
[1:42:13] wilderness
[1:42:13] the same one that was there in the
[1:42:18] beginning the same one that was with
[1:42:19] them in the exodus journey the same one
[1:42:22] who was there when Moses passed off the
[1:42:24] scene the same one who revealed to
[1:42:27] Joshua and who brought him into the land
[1:42:29] the same one that messenger of the
[1:42:32] Covenant you see Levi or Aaron himself
[1:42:37] this Aaron he was able to minister but
[1:42:40] he could not Minister up a better
[1:42:41] covenant Aaron can only minister of that
[1:42:45] covenant which spoke of bondage it spoke
[1:42:48] of a need for a deliverance hey Aaron
[1:42:51] himself had to minister he had to
[1:42:54] minister an offering of sin for his own
[1:42:56] self first but this one he didn't have
[1:43:00] to minister an offering for his own sin
[1:43:02] he himself was the supreme perfect
[1:43:06] offering the Lamb of God now by this
[1:43:10] he's able to minister those promises
[1:43:13] that are contained within that covenant
[1:43:16] I want you to watch this here this
[1:43:18] Ministry of the Covenant let me just let
[1:43:20] me just have just a few more moments
[1:43:21] here
[1:43:22] look how Paul picks this up in Galatians
[1:43:24] chapter 3 verse 7 and he's speaking now
[1:43:27] to the Galatian Church know ye therefore
[1:43:29] that they which are of faith the same
[1:43:31] are the children of Abraham remember how
[1:43:34] Paul has made this difference than just
[1:43:36] because they are seeded of Abraham does
[1:43:38] not mean that they are of the promise
[1:43:39] it's those who are of the promise that
[1:43:42] are of faith they are the ones who are
[1:43:44] spoke enough
[1:43:45] now what's this scripture in verse 8 and
[1:43:48] the scripture foreseeing that God would
[1:43:52] justify the heathen through faith
[1:43:55] preached before the gospel unto Abraham
[1:44:00] so God's a preacher God preached unto
[1:44:04] Abraham saying in thee shall all nations
[1:44:07] be blessed you see what Paul is using is
[1:44:11] now how the administration has changed
[1:44:14] from the validity stood to that
[1:44:16] priesthood after the order of
[1:44:17] Melchizedek it's where the light has
[1:44:19] come and that ministry goes forth as the
[1:44:22] son himself is revealing himself through
[1:44:24] that ministry to call
[1:44:26] the children of God unto Christ not
[1:44:31] after the old order the old order is
[1:44:33] bondage right the old order is bonding
[1:44:37] is always pointing back to this old
[1:44:38] order no no the old order is bondage
[1:44:40] remember that's the same spirit that
[1:44:43] worked down through the church ages are
[1:44:46] you with me that wanted to set up a holy
[1:44:47] man we only hear this man we hear no
[1:44:50] other man you anthony friends back
[1:44:53] that's a wrong spirit that's the spirit
[1:44:54] of Antichrist no matter what's Pope or
[1:44:57] whoever people make it they can make it
[1:44:59] their favorite preacher they can make it
[1:45:01] this or one or more
[1:45:02] it's an antichrist spirit we are to hear
[1:45:04] the voice of God is that right
[1:45:08] and the voice of God is that voice of
[1:45:11] many waters is that right
[1:45:14] God has a messenger to every age but
[1:45:16] then from that messenger the light goes
[1:45:18] out is that right that pattern goes out
[1:45:22] in the ministry of others what is the
[1:45:24] ministry of others to call to speak to
[1:45:26] those and call them into the covenant
[1:45:29] with Jesus Christ not under an old order
[1:45:33] oh my you see when they came what they
[1:45:38] were wanting to do they going to keep
[1:45:39] pointing people back to Moses come on
[1:45:41] friends they wanted to keep pointing him
[1:45:43] back to Moses well you're leaving Moses
[1:45:45] you're getting away from Moses they kept
[1:45:47] on one to do that they didn't realize
[1:45:48] that was bondage if you don't continue
[1:45:51] in the word you're in bondage you must
[1:45:54] continue in the perfect law of Liberty
[1:45:58] glory be to God so here God foreseeing
[1:46:02] that he would justify the heathen he
[1:46:04] preached before the gospel unto Abraham
[1:46:07] now when God preached his gospel he came
[1:46:09] not inward only when he preached that
[1:46:13] they Abraham became a power and
[1:46:15] demonstration is that right
[1:46:17] he called Abraham out what he spoke to
[1:46:19] Abraham he revealed this is the land I
[1:46:21] was talking to you about who did it call
[1:46:24] it called the elect out God visited him
[1:46:27] in signs and forms and lights and dreams
[1:46:30] God visited him there was the gifts that
[1:46:33] were present with this visitation are
[1:46:36] you with me it continued to accumulate
[1:46:38] on down
[1:46:39] through time even how God himself would
[1:46:41] make himself known to Abraham now let's
[1:46:43] go on here in the book of Galatians
[1:46:45] where it speaks of how that Paul goes on
[1:46:47] talking about you know how it's not of
[1:46:49] its the law in the law it says by faith
[1:46:52] it's not not of the law and Christ he
[1:46:54] said was redeemed has redeemed us from
[1:46:56] the curse of the law being made a curse
[1:46:58] for us it is written cursed is every one
[1:47:00] that hangeth on a tree that the blessing
[1:47:03] of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[1:47:05] through Jesus Christ that we might
[1:47:06] receive the promise of the Spirit
[1:47:08] through faith through faith
[1:47:12] what's faith revelation it's not well I
[1:47:15] believe I got it I'll just go ahead no
[1:47:17] no that's my hope my faith is where the
[1:47:22] word itself is preached faith cometh by
[1:47:25] hearing and hearing by the word so it
[1:47:30] shows look the word can go forth and yet
[1:47:33] people not hear the word in the words
[1:47:35] going forth alright because the word
[1:47:39] itself there must be a hearing of that
[1:47:41] as the Spirit of God tunes in that heart
[1:47:44] and what's it doing it's drawing the
[1:47:46] heart onto Christ to a place of
[1:47:48] surrender to learn that even a person
[1:47:51] can say I need the Lord Jesus Christ as
[1:47:53] my savior I'm a sinner thank God for
[1:47:55] that
[1:47:56] that's a start that's the beginning but
[1:47:59] that's not what we're talking about
[1:48:01] there's a start to that there must be a
[1:48:03] call to but then that same Spirit of God
[1:48:06] works to bring a cleansing a sanctified
[1:48:09] life where it scours out be inside that
[1:48:12] he himself might feel it
[1:48:14] with his own life and that's not
[1:48:17] something that's just a faith it is
[1:48:20] something that is divinely vindicated by
[1:48:23] the overcoming power within your life
[1:48:26] you with me Galatians 3:15 something
[1:48:32] I'll probably think I'm making good on
[1:48:33] that promise I made exactly no though it
[1:48:42] be but a man's covenant yet if it be
[1:48:47] confirmed no man dissin knows it or
[1:48:51] addeth
[1:48:52] there - it doesn't matter what's come
[1:48:56] after God confirmed the Covenant
[1:48:57] it doesn't annul the company once God
[1:49:02] has confirmed the covenant whatever
[1:49:05] could come after it does not dissing off
[1:49:07] the covenant now if we can apply this
[1:49:10] just even in our spiritual walk after
[1:49:13] God has confirmed himself in you his
[1:49:18] life has so transformed your life to
[1:49:21] where your desire is for him and him
[1:49:24] alone you can look back and say mom I've
[1:49:27] made mistakes here I've fallen short
[1:49:28] here I've fallen short there but inside
[1:49:30] of your heart burns a desire to please
[1:49:33] him when the slightest little thing
[1:49:35] would come along that seems to disturb
[1:49:38] him in any way quickly you're there to
[1:49:40] say Lord forgive me Lord cleanse me Lord
[1:49:44] because you are sealed unto the day of
[1:49:47] your redemption now to Abraham and his
[1:49:53] seed where the promises made he saith
[1:49:56] not and to seeds as of many but as a war
[1:49:59] and to thy seed which is Christ and this
[1:50:03] I say look at this verse that the
[1:50:05] Covenant that was confirmed before of
[1:50:09] God in Christ oh my Paul is reaching
[1:50:15] clear back before there was Adam
[1:50:18] Stardust where it was in God's mine but
[1:50:24] then to Abraham God confirmed it in
[1:50:28] Christ to Abraham remember Abraham
[1:50:31] standing in Genesis 15 whereby shall I
[1:50:33] know I shall inherit and God and veiled
[1:50:37] Calvary right there this is how you
[1:50:39] shall know you shall inherit the law
[1:50:46] which was four hundred and thirty years
[1:50:47] after cannot dissin all it was Christ
[1:50:52] back there that it should make the
[1:50:55] promise of none effect for if the
[1:50:57] inheritance be of the law it is no more
[1:50:59] of promise but God gave it to Abraham by
[1:51:03] promise
[1:51:05] so here he stands the messenger of the
[1:51:07] Covenant Christ the Bible says that he
[1:51:14] who you delight in he shall come
[1:51:17] suddenly to his temple remember there
[1:51:21] was not a temple even though that this
[1:51:23] in type could be laid upon David's heart
[1:51:26] by God but yet even how Solomon would
[1:51:29] express it that there's not a house that
[1:51:31] man can build you that she would come
[1:51:32] into Elian I think of how brother banner
[1:51:35] picks it up in prayer one time he said
[1:51:37] Lord there's not a building here on this
[1:51:39] earth that's worthy of your presence
[1:51:41] there's not one of us that's worthy Lord
[1:51:44] but he said how thankful we are that you
[1:51:46] don't look at that you come according to
[1:51:49] your word aren't you glad not according
[1:51:53] to our worthiness I'm so glad for that
[1:51:56] so here he comes suddenly to his temple
[1:51:59] it's his temple a temple that was not
[1:52:02] made with hands a tent that the Lord
[1:52:06] Himself pitched this was a body that he
[1:52:09] prepared for himself to come and dwell
[1:52:12] in a tabernacle a temple and here we
[1:52:15] find that down there that day at the
[1:52:16] River Jordan that here John had been
[1:52:18] proclaiming he's here he's here but
[1:52:22] there that day here it was the word
[1:52:24] walked out into the water to the Prophet
[1:52:26] and their eyes met one another and about
[1:52:28] that time here that when he went as his
[1:52:31] baptizing him the heavens were opened
[1:52:33] and how the heavens were open here came
[1:52:36] the Spirit of God descending down in the
[1:52:38] form of a devil my it was that same
[1:52:41] pillar fire but in the form of a dove
[1:52:43] because God was not coming into a
[1:52:45] building of stone he was coming into his
[1:52:49] human temple Alleluia here's the
[1:52:55] messenger of the Covenant here's the
[1:52:56] mediator that's here all my to think of
[1:52:59] it there's one relationship that you and
[1:53:02] I have to God and that is Jesus that's
[1:53:07] the truth without Jesus Christ you and I
[1:53:11] have no connection back
[1:53:13] and that's why they make Jesus Christ
[1:53:16] men less than God to make him the second
[1:53:18] person you're not redeemed you're still
[1:53:20] in your sins but it is the very God of
[1:53:23] glory the messenger of the Covenant
[1:53:26] himself that has prepared a body there
[1:53:29] was not no one who was worthy or could
[1:53:32] produce that kind of a body but he
[1:53:34] provided the body himself how did he
[1:53:37] provide it he provided it by His Word
[1:53:39] and he's done the same thing down
[1:53:43] through the ages there was not a church
[1:53:45] that could produce a body but he himself
[1:53:48] has brought forth by his word a body a
[1:53:51] masterpiece that he might step into and
[1:53:55] reflect his glory through hallelujah
[1:54:01] think of where we're standing in the
[1:54:03] sour at any moment any moment the change
[1:54:08] can come where we stand in line with the
[1:54:14] Scriptures the Bible says God was in
[1:54:17] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:54:21] himself not imputing their trespasses oh
[1:54:26] my if he were added more if he had
[1:54:28] imputed the trespasses that have been no
[1:54:30] hope is that right here were those that
[1:54:34] came and they caught the woman in
[1:54:35] adultery now watch this what's that
[1:54:38] prideful spirit they come in there and
[1:54:41] they had their stones they gathered
[1:54:44] together they weren't gathering to
[1:54:47] minister mercy I think then people like
[1:54:50] stoning people except today it ain't
[1:54:55] stones it's quotes or scriptures glory
[1:55:01] how am I getting ahead of myself here
[1:55:05] well let that marinate but they wanted
[1:55:09] him to condemn her he said whichever
[1:55:15] ones among you without sin let him be
[1:55:17] the first one to cast you
[1:55:18] you want to cast stones go ahead you're
[1:55:21] without sin go ahead oh you need my
[1:55:24] mercy then drop your stones you need you
[1:55:28] need my mercy then drop him I need his
[1:55:32] mercy
[1:55:32] I need his mercy I'm not talking about
[1:55:37] over there saying I'm not gonna be a
[1:55:38] compromise or the work be careful that
[1:55:40] that spirit is not an arrogant spirit
[1:55:42] that works to put people down that's
[1:55:44] pride but notice the Bible declares to
[1:55:50] us in this time then the Word was made
[1:55:53] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:55:57] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:56:00] Father full of grace and truth
[1:56:04] here he is stepping forward stepping
[1:56:08] forward in his word declaring himself
[1:56:11] this cleric the covenant to you and I
[1:56:13] the Bible says for it please the father
[1:56:15] or in him to all fullness dwell look at
[1:56:19] this look look friends listen don't let
[1:56:21] this just be history this this right
[1:56:25] here is the pattern of the hour it's
[1:56:28] been the pattern that's been laid down
[1:56:30] through the ages because as the bride
[1:56:33] was taken out of the groom she is to
[1:56:36] reflect he is as the prophet told us an
[1:56:41] indictment the example son of what God
[1:56:45] intends every son and daughter of God to
[1:56:48] be so the way that he came to minister
[1:56:51] think of this in this time for in him it
[1:56:55] pleased the father it pleased him to
[1:56:58] move down in his life
[1:57:01] this wasn't an automatic it wasn't just
[1:57:05] automatically given well you know this
[1:57:07] is this is a temple that the Lord has
[1:57:09] made this wasn't just automatic but he
[1:57:12] found him in perfect obedience young
[1:57:17] with me this morning I know I've know
[1:57:19] I'm going a little bit longer but don't
[1:57:20] don't let this slip you don't let this
[1:57:22] slip by you don't let this just be that
[1:57:24] of old maja I'm thankful for the Lord
[1:57:26] Jesus Christ look at this this is a
[1:57:27] pattern this is the pattern of where we
[1:57:30] are to be
[1:57:32] in this hour we're not in the feet were
[1:57:34] not in the thighs we're not in the torso
[1:57:36] we're not in the eyes we're in the mind
[1:57:38] it's a full body that which he's able to
[1:57:44] have preeminence inside of it pleased
[1:57:47] the father look what this did it pleased
[1:57:50] the father did well having made peace
[1:57:51] through the blood of his cross by him to
[1:57:54] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[1:57:56] I say whether they be things in earth or
[1:57:58] things in heaven and you that were
[1:58:00] sometime alienated and enemies in your
[1:58:02] mind by wicked works yet now hath he
[1:58:07] reconciled was there any way that you or
[1:58:12] me was there anything that we could do
[1:58:13] or produce that would bring this
[1:58:15] reconciling so it was all on him well
[1:58:21] brother Samuel we have to submit I know
[1:58:23] that but what is it that brings
[1:58:25] submission commands demands or is it is
[1:58:35] love
[1:58:37] his presence in this was his love God's
[1:58:45] love manifested unto us it requires us
[1:58:51] to come into submission but to think
[1:58:54] about it he'd we don't come into
[1:58:55] submission oh no oh no I don't want to
[1:58:59] go to hell huh
[1:59:00] that's fear that's not why we serve the
[1:59:04] Lord we serve the Lord because we love
[1:59:08] Him the Lord Jesus said if any man will
[1:59:13] keep my commandment love me and keep my
[1:59:17] Commandments we will come and make our
[1:59:21] abode he's drawn by the honouring of his
[1:59:28] word think of that how that God himself
[1:59:34] so moved down Paul puts it like this in
[1:59:38] the book of Romans let me just read one
[1:59:41] verse two verses to you here in Romans
[1:59:44] 15 7 and do you good to read that read
[1:59:47] the first few verses of Romans 15 look
[1:59:49] where Paul he would seem like Paul's so
[1:59:51] out of so out of context here he's not
[1:59:53] he just talks in the first six verses of
[1:59:56] how we ought to relate among one another
[1:59:58] as a body and after that relation you
[2:00:01] know Paul deals with that a lot the one
[2:00:03] Paul is a spirit of God but notice how
[2:00:06] he brings it in verse 7 of Romans 15
[2:00:08] wherefore receive you one another as
[2:00:15] Christ also received us to the glory of
[2:00:19] God
[2:00:20] how am I to receive as as Christ
[2:00:23] received us remember what we were
[2:00:25] regarded as dogs heathens
[2:00:29] there wasn't any good title behind us
[2:00:32] but how did Christ receive us not
[2:00:37] imputing their trespasses unto them but
[2:00:40] he came to deal with it look what this
[2:00:42] says in verse 8 now I say this that
[2:00:47] Jesus Christ was a minister
[2:00:50] of the circumcision for the truth of God
[2:00:53] to confirm the promises made unto the
[2:00:58] father's but the Gentiles might glorify
[2:01:00] God for his mercy as it is written for
[2:01:03] this cause I will confess the among the
[2:01:06] Gentiles and sing unto thy name and
[2:01:07] again he saith rejoice ye Gentiles with
[2:01:10] his people and again praise the Lord all
[2:01:12] you Gentiles and laud him all you people
[2:01:14] and again Isaiah said there shall a root
[2:01:17] of Jesse and he that shall rise to reign
[2:01:20] over the Gentiles in him shall the
[2:01:22] Gentiles trust Jesus Christ was a
[2:01:29] servant a minister of the circumcision
[2:01:33] of the truth he who was the highest of
[2:01:38] the highest became the lowest of the
[2:01:43] Lost
[2:01:44] remember when he is speaking to those
[2:01:47] the sons of zebedee and he addresses and
[2:01:49] asked the question they go through
[2:01:50] things
[2:01:51] there is indignation that rises up among
[2:01:53] the other ten and the Lord Jesus speaks
[2:01:56] to them and lets them know been in the
[2:02:00] Gentile kingdoms the exercise authority
[2:02:02] over one another whoever is the great
[2:02:06] one exercises authority but he says this
[2:02:10] shall not be this way in the kingdom of
[2:02:14] God and it goes on to let them know that
[2:02:18] even for me I have not come the son of
[2:02:21] man has not come to be ministered to
[2:02:24] I've come to minister see wasn't about
[2:02:29] being ministered to he came to minister
[2:02:33] the truth of the Covenant
[2:02:36] not just Minister it he was the Covenant
[2:02:40] there was the Covenant there within him
[2:02:43] the promise the oath that was made it
[2:02:46] was laying right there is that right and
[2:02:49] then that day on Calvary when the veil
[2:02:52] in the temple in the top to the bottom
[2:02:54] was rent there he was hanging in plain
[2:03:01] think of how this here a servant when we
[2:03:05] bring it down to our own lives our own
[2:03:06] hearts how about in our lives the
[2:03:09] issuing in of the New Testament
[2:03:11] if the issuing in of the New Testament
[2:03:14] it requires one laying down its life
[2:03:18] then the issuing in of this promise
[2:03:20] requires us to lay down our life and it
[2:03:23] requires us to lay down our lives again
[2:03:26] and again and again is that right Jesus
[2:03:33] carried his cross there right one day
[2:03:38] one time but he said to you and I take
[2:03:44] up your cross daily and follow me
[2:03:52] remembering this not a man we're not
[2:03:54] here to be served we're here to serve
[2:03:58] we're here to serve to give our lives
[2:04:01] this is the whole this is one of the
[2:04:03] foundation principles here of the New
[2:04:06] Testament the New Testament is the
[2:04:08] issuing in of the New Covenant the
[2:04:10] better covenant the marriage covenant
[2:04:12] it's not serving one being served when
[2:04:16] it's us serving he took upon himself the
[2:04:20] form of a servant made in the likeness
[2:04:28] of man aren't you glad aren't you glad
[2:04:33] that he came to serve if he had come to
[2:04:37] be served
[2:04:39] we wouldn't be redeemed but you see it
[2:04:44] wasn't just the act friends he wasn't
[2:04:46] just the act
[2:04:46] it wasn't Calvary was not just an act
[2:04:49] this was reality he laid down his life
[2:04:58] why did he do that
[2:05:02] for you and me aren't you glad for that
[2:05:09] what a challenge then it comes to our
[2:05:11] hearts and our lives as the bride of
[2:05:13] Jesus Christ to remember it's not about
[2:05:16] me being served and I'm too sorry
[2:05:20] it's a serf you're to serve I'm to serve
[2:05:23] is that right I might have my needs I
[2:05:27] might have my feelings I might but it's
[2:05:29] about him is that right say lord help me
[2:05:35] help me Lord help me to override
[2:05:40] override my feelings oh brother Samuel
[2:05:43] the feelings feelings are very real I
[2:05:44] agree with that but let us not elevate
[2:05:47] them they'll glorify their let us not
[2:05:49] put them to a place to where they're
[2:05:50] greater than God but let us look to the
[2:05:52] Lord who is able you believe that this
[2:05:57] morning oh my even service have two
[2:06:02] servant it comes to serve
[2:06:06] serving think of this friend he serves
[2:06:10] what you and I have need of and that
[2:06:15] wonderful he knows what you're dealing
[2:06:18] with in your life
[2:06:19] he knows the pressures he knows
[2:06:22] everything that you're going through he
[2:06:24] sees it and he himself would so subject
[2:06:29] himself to come and minister to our
[2:06:32] needs there's a lot of things that he
[2:06:36] could say a lot of things that he could
[2:06:38] say and be really good be really good
[2:06:42] but if it doesn't minister to our needs
[2:06:46] and it's just serving him it's not him
[2:06:50] serving us but you see what it does when
[2:06:54] he comes down to serve and minister to
[2:06:57] us what does that do it draws out of us
[2:07:01] it draws out of us a surrendered
[2:07:04] willingness the issuing in of this New
[2:07:11] Testament
[2:07:12] surrendered life-giving over to him lord
[2:07:17] help us Jesus help us
[2:07:22] let's pray Lord Jesus
[2:07:29] or truly you are the quicken ER of the
[2:07:34] word Lord Jesus it's you Lord that makes
[2:07:39] you Word Alive and real to our hearts
[2:07:43] well Jesus we're so thankful Lord God
[2:07:47] for your great mercy so thankful Lord

[2:07:53] your word here this morning Lord we look
[2:07:57] Lord God Lord just as Paul would write
[2:08:02] their to the Romans writing to us the
[2:08:07] Lord in this day remember he would write
[2:08:11] to the Ephesians remember
[2:08:14] Lord it's many of the things that even
[2:08:17] when you would ride in the book of
[2:08:18] Deuteronomy to Israel remember or Jesus
[2:08:23] I pray this morning
[2:08:31] that may Lord God as we remember
[2:08:34] we think back Lord God to know that Lord
