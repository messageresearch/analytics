let's sing out one more time this morning is that your prayer this morning we have your way [Applause] [Music] holy spirit' our hearts and have your why sweet way [Music] and as we [Music] just speak your into heart and have your a man I believe he can speak just this morning Amen hallelujah give him praise amen hallelujah amen I believe we've received a word in this day a man I believe he wants to speak to us you know if one word from the adversary could cause every hospital every sickness every cemetery every funeral that was ever preached is because of one word one word from the enemy amen but if one word from God could come today what can he do in our lives he's more than able to give us exceedingly abundantly above anything we could ask her think I believe that he's greater today than that word that for cause to fall in the garden I believe is a grace here the Senate that's a present today that you can't fall from Amen because this bride the Prophet said she's predestinated not to fall hey man we've got a word today maybe just come and speak one word into our lives he could change everything this morning amen amen god bless she was good to see you we're just so happy to be with you again we just always appreciate the Spirit of God and the different ones here you brought them with you amen and that's what makes it special because when the service is over and we all go home today if the Lord should tarry maybe we will have to wait that long but maybe our loved ones come walk in the back door during the middle of service I'd be alright with that if we go home today man you take him with you and that that's what makes this special we can come here and we can sing and that's all good and fine but to know that he said he'd never leave us or forsake us he's he's not left us to lead ourselves around could you imagine trying to wander around find your own way through life on your own you know it would it would be a disaster you know just to think that even since old times they've had they they traveled by the Stars and the Sun and and and they we've always needed a sense of direction and how much more God has given us a man who wrote three Bibles is that right so God's never left us without a witness the Bible says and so we're so thankful for that and I just I just feel good to be here with you this morning and I'm gonna keep talking if I don't take my attacks so I'll have you open your Bibles here to Isaiah the 55th chapter and speaking of leadership I I was seeking the will of God which way to go and that's a good thing to do anyway I really didn't know even this morning is on the way here and this is just kinda the Lord brought me to and I pray to be a blessing to you Isaiah the 55th chapter we're gonna read the first four verses this morning and I want to talk about fits to rule where the RAM said that power without character is satanic amen the power with characters fit to rule I want to talk about that this morning we're looking at the first four verses the Bible says ho every one that thirst if come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come you buy any yeh come buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfies not hearken diligently unto me and eat that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness he says incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you even the shore mercies of David I could preach a whole nother sermon that was just a thought but this is what Christ has received the sure mercies of David God made a covenant with David that after his seed is that right after his seed he would put a one on the throne to rule over Israel Jesus being the son of David and I one look at this fourth verse this morning really for the text were taken here speaking about David the Bible says this about him behold I have given him for a witness to the people a leader and a commander to the people let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father were so thankful for the word which has been read this morning Lord to know that to know that men have suffered and died that they might preserve this by believing and even that we might have in our own language this morning that it might be made available to us known that the Catholic Church sought to keep it out of the hands of the people and different ones that were burned at the stake and they suffered Lord men and women who believe this war they watch their own children suffer and were tortured because they believe the words of this viable more than what a priest or an organization would teach them and to know that you preserved this Bible these scriptures for us down through the quarters of Time Lord it's a remarkable thing but Lord it's remarkable to me to think that as you preserve this word in this book this morning so to have you preserved your seed through ancestry and through down the corridors of time or maybe maybe bootleggers or whatever kind of a pass we come out of Lord we were a people who are not a people but you've made us the people of God and as we stand here we bear witness this morning that just as you preserved this scripture so to have you preserved that word that you placed in our lives father when we were wayward from me when we weren't looking for direction you come and you come to us or we weren't looking for you but you came and found us you left the 99 to come to us Lord when we were in darkness when we were in the miry clay and we made our bed in Hell Lord yet you were there with us and you found us and with a strong arm you drew us out and you brought us to this place you've set our feet upon a rock Lord the revelation of Jesus Christ in your people today lo we're so grateful for that and Lord I marvel as the scripture says to behold what manner of love you have for us Lord you loved us more than than just that they're just as a servant or just as a friend but you loved us to cause the sons of God behold now are we the sons of God and the Lord as I think of this great love that you would send your son to across to die for to know what you paid for a sort of I'm so persuaded this weren't Lord if you would do all that for us or you're not leave us to our own devices this morning but surely you would come and bless and speak to your people once again Lord you would meet us where I and you would lift us up a little bit higher because you desire for a people to go to rapture to overcome every darkness of Laodicea and never pass every device of the enemy that in the midst of Satan's eating he would draw pride for Jesus Christ and have preeminence lord I just pray right now that you'd come and take full control in the service Lord take these lips of clay and speak through them or take these ears and these hearts and these eyes and bear witness once again but the resurrection of Jesus Christ you know life is a gray and low we'll be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory for we asking the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the bride says Amen god bless his you're seated talking about being fit to rule the idea of leadership you know brother Graham preaches on leadership and he you know he preaches the young people he preaches the businessmen and he preaches this different idea and he has it he says you've heard it preached certain ways before and he take a different I so there's so many aspects of leadership in our life amen and brother Brandon he makes the statement about leadership he said you know Moses because he said when we're from the time that we were born we're being led by something he said Moses when he was born he had a he had a godly mother how many's thinking for godly mothers a man I believe we got some here this morning I believe I got a wife that's like that he said he had a godly mother and she taught him that he was born to be a deliverer he was born with a purpose and I want you to understand brother Branham says a mommy before Matthew Mark and Luke and John get to him mommies there she's the fifth gospel and then so look it's not just a CEO and a business but leadership isn't if you're a mother or if you're somebody somebody's looking at your life somewhere a man somebody's watching you whether you realize it or not it might be in your home it might be a church it might be the job whatever it is somebody's watching this yep this was a mighty man he'd he got his didn't doctors his doctor his master's degree in engineering and warfare need he learned all these things and yet with all the education and then you know some people get scared of education what listen education is not the problem but it's what it leads you to amen because sometimes education will lead you to a spirit of education now I know all spirit of devil amen the brother bands is am NOT supporting ignorance I'm glad for the car I drove here this morning I'm glad for the for all the science and the medicine that we have I'm thankful those things amen but we have to watch the spirit of it I want you to understand that even though this man he was an educated man he'd been taught in the wisdom of the Egyptian and everything he'd learned yet there was something in his life that stuck with him from the time he was a little kid when he's a 40 year old man and he's successful he knows he's gonna have power and authority in Egypt he can look at the mud fields of Egypt and see a bunch of nobody's stopping money the tricks and there was something in his heart that Mommy played place there when he was just a little kid stuck with him there all his college and they're always learning and they're all successes in life then he was born to be a delivery to those people there was something that stuck with him he couldn't get away from it it's so working so burning his heart so he looked at those people they were owned bondage covered in mud and he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater than the riches of Egypt there was something that moved in his heart he said I've got to have what they've got this is a man that got everything in the natural he might have been a big celebrity nowadays their TV star a sports star and you think about young people they're looking to some sort of leadership so many people in the world mommy's always golfing daddy's always gone and they're trying to be like a celebrity they're trying to be like some great somebody they they're looking for leadership somewhere but God give you a fifth gospel God give us his word not the fashion ourselves after that but there's a reproach of Christ it's in Hollywood it's greater than raising that this country can offer you hey my my my we can look at this country we could well praise the Lord you can look at the last few actions you can look all over this country you look through the world and you can see what I'm talking about amen you have people that are in position of authority they've got an influence or maybe they've got Authority or whatever it is and they're in a position of leadership but they lack leadership ability so hell frizz or something all often cuz you done worked a job like that before hey listen I've had a lot of bosses and I'm not trying to be critical but I've had more bad ones than good ones jobs I've worked at they make I get a witness it meant a couple of year but you agree I mean I've had a lot worse listen man man he knows some money or you somebody's friend and he's in a position of authority but he lacks the character to rule or to lead hey man he lacks that that's something that was inside Moses that directed his heart toward God even when he was in the world when he was a great big somebody there was something in him that directed him back to God and we find people they've got every kind of motive and every kind of a reason for what they're doing whether it's money or popularity or women or whatever and they lock something to sleep that's directing them amen I believe there's one leadership that man needs amen and you can look through the history of humanity and find that man he's unable to lead himself and maybe he raised up a ruler maybe he's even a decent King or a decent ruler and what happens is after a while he dies he men well namesake my my daddy cuz we're great you named me after Alexander the Great had a lot better aspirations for me than I did Alexander the nobody whatever Hey and there's a man that you look at history and he conquers the known world by the age of 33 well I'm 36 I'm still trying to mow my yard mowed and then I don't know what I go on half the time they meant strunk I pay my bills and here's the guy that has conquered the known world by the age of 33 and yet he dies in this whole kingdom and it's all achievement it it turns into nothing the only thing you've got to be thankful for today is that your Bibles in Greek because of him the originally Testaments in Greek came in because of that and then Amanda might have great charisma or maybe great talent and yet he lacks the character to be a real leader amen so why'd you say why you says because many times we talk about following brother Brant talking about leadership we try to follow the right kind of leadership hey man and what I want you to understand is if you follow the right kind of leadership you will have the same kind of character as that leadership Amen because a disciple that is perfectly trained he's just like his master so Jesus said is that right do you look at this man David I won't take this text because I like how God puts us in here amen he says this and the fourth verses is behold I have given him for a witness the people and the first thing I want you notice about David because God uses David is an example a man the first thing he says about David before he mentions his qualifications is as I have given him that's the very first thing he says I gave you David I gave David to the people for a reason I watch understand if you're sitting here this morning and you are a Christian God has a purpose in your life and it's more than just a warm appeal it's more than just to go work a job from 9:00 to 5:00 there's a gift and a purpose in your life and many times we let the cares of life distract us from the calling that God has placed in her life and then I think about the marvel of human potential just just in the natural you're looking at human being you know you yeah I think so many times you know the world's looking for a cure for cancer I was looking for the next big breakthrough in engineering something for all these different things and I wonder how many times are we guilty in this country of destroying the answer to what we're looking for watts in the womb think about what I'm saying out of this country millions of children murder before they're even born and maybe one of them has the potentials and then you look at a child and raising the wrong kind of a home they're raising a home with abuse and vice and how they go off wayward in life and they think maybe chotto move that child were placed in the right kind of a leadership the right common atmosphere might be the next great doctor the next great surgeon and what have they done they've destroyed the potential there's Gibson their life just in the natural that have been given to us and how much more is a Christian God has placed things in your life hey man don't you don't have to be the pastor to have gifted her life the manifestations of spirits given everything the Bible says the Prophet Eamon sisters you've got a purpose hey man hallelujah brothers you've got a purpose whether you're eight years old or eight years old God can use you I marvel at all the different times in the Bible God you know how many times in the Bible to take somebody's really old or really young and use them he'll take a Jeremiah it's just a child he'll take Moses and wait till he's 80 years old so now you're ready now you're ready for your work now you're ready for the minister hey man god you're not disqualified but your natural ability amen that's the best thing about the kingdom you're not disqualified by some natural barrier Amen all you need to have is the right character the right leadership if Christ is in your heart leading and guiding you he'll take you into all truth amen the Bible says they that are led of the Spirit they are the sons of God you believe that so if you're a son of God this morning if your daughter of God you've got leadership present in your life whether you always recognize their heart he's always there he's always leading he's always directing he's not left us on our own it's all right he's giving us gifts he gave gifts to the church like he gave David he gave gifts to the church he gave some apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers why were they given for you brother the great gifting is alive what was he giving it was for you the gift was not for him you're not here from your own ambition God put you here for a reason you might have 10 talents you might have five you might be able to bang on a drum with it with a box wrench and that might be your only gift you got one Talent amen you can bury it in the ground or you can use it in the service of Almighty God I matter David's own life he was given he's a gift to the people I meant it's a type of Christ is that right I'll think about David here's a man the Bible says a man after God's own heart that's a pretty good testimony hey man I hope they they can say that about I hope God can say that about me that's good in my life there is a man after my own heart yeah David big mistakes come on summer that's all right hey man listen we all make mistakes huh that don't disqualify you he was given by God he was given by God now I'm not justifying his mistakes I'm not justifying his fail here but what I'm saying is God is greater than his failure God is greater than his mistakes God was greater than his humanity David hundreds of blood of bulls and goats what can he do for his bride let's gathered here this morning and don't matter what kind of a posse of God and don't matter what kind of a family you come from God can use him he can lead you this morning amen the Bible says I have given him as well a witness I'm looking this idea of a witness this morning in his own life the Bible says he was given as a witness you know I think one of the most obvious hallmarks of a good leader is somebody knows what they're talking about because a lot of them know amen you mean brother well I don't know I tell you why I'm in the Christian bookstore a little while but you can go in the Christian bookstore and you can find a hundred different books by a hundred different authors let's say a hundred different things they've all got their own idea and they're all trying to you know bestseller list hey man but how many machs you know in the talk around the premises and the first sermon on the message facing the substance he says we find many people talk a lot about faith but when it comes down to it they don't really know what they're talking about and then they don't stand up in a showdown hey man listen there's a lot of men a lot of soldiers that were gathered there that morning we've Goliath come on for the 40th day in a row is begin to boast against the people of Israel Saul I've been their solar king he'd been sitting there like all these other men the lobby thought they knew what to do But Here Come a witness Here Come a little boy he's a witness this morning and when he gets up to Saul and Saul tries to pull his ecclesiastical armor on him he says I don't need the hatch hey man I'm a witness notice what he begin to do with Saul he didn't hand them a message back and so I'm gonna quote for this he didn't say well I've heard a story one time on somebody they said no you know I'm a witness I was up taking care of my daddy's sheep do my father's will like I always do and nobody was looking and I was out there one day taking care of daddy sheep and a lion come upon the Sheep and I took that thing mother main and I slapped that sheep right out of his mouth and I slay that thing right now don't worry stupid what do you think the creatures of the woodland would learn a lesson but a big old bear come on a few days later he said watch I'm gonna try my luck and maybe slip the bear just the same I watched God killing you witnesses when I've watched God heal the sick I've seen him fight he's mighty battle listen I watch Godslayer back I once got sore and this uncircumcised Philistine he'll did not dear friend listen you've got to know what you're talking about it's nothing to say I believe a message I believe the message this just being able to read that's just being able to sympathize the devil believes in amen he believes in trembles but we've got to have a witness like David we've got to know that the Spirit of God bears witness with our spirit this is one thing if I get up here and I tell you God heals the sick well the Bible says God heals a sick let's sure what's another one I can tell you I've been in my life I've been sick where I didn't know what to do and the doctors didn't know how to move and I prayed and I seen God come down I know he's a healer I've seen him right hey man hey man I was talking I was talking to a gentleman here a while back this is a long story I'm gonna make it real short but this man is a the grand whatever the Jehovah Witness Kingdom Hall my town Pumbaa or whatever it is I know the call wizard it was here they're kind of weird name that God and he got my name when we were talking about the Bible and I was talking to him that Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today forever he began to tell me how this part of my Bible don't mean that anymore this part my logo don't mean anymore I said well life God heals the sick is it God oh he don't do that anymore here that's not what God does he stopped doing that and finally I said I looked at him cuz he want him to listen to me and I wasn't really listening to him at that point when you tell me not to believe what the Bible says I usually shut down on you and I finally looked at that man said you know what I can take you to a little boy that was five years old and he was deaf and dumb and God opened his ears and God opened his mouth I can show you a man that was blind in his eyes and God opened his eyes I could take you to a woman she was crippled and God raised her up I can give you a testimony after testimony of God what I've seen in my life God do I said if you want I'll give you their emails I'll give you their phone numbers and you can calm up and you can let them know who they got healed by false doctrine that's just a psychology they just worked up and you like that now he let me know that you think the devil is more powerful and God yes for me and my house we're gonna serve this God cuz that same God that did that to that woman that healed that little boy that made them all he's the same daughter he's my body he's the same sin your mouth that's the kind of God I want to serve I'll tell you what he sound like some of the men that look at a glass that morning they got a big old devil it's time to switch gods it's time to get a real guard behind you the Holy Ghost and fire Jesus Christ the same I don't need a bunch of theology and a bunch of nonsense I'm not impressed by The Devil's bus this morning then wasn't impressed by the devil's bus hit men of God that was bigger than your eyes he was bigger than a lion bigger than all his problems bigger than all his fears and he knew that the God that stood behind him was greater than any prominent lay before him there wasn't about a bear or a lion or giant there was enough Philistines to make him back down he heard from God he'd been anointed to be a king and he knew God was faithful oh he knew he was called to it he knew he was called to be a king and there wasn't enough Devils in hell to stop it from coming to pass there weren't enough Spears of the camp of the Philistines just stopped him from being a king he's a witness amen see a witness he doesn't have to compel you by the threat of force enough to compel you with education they're learning he compels you by the conviction of his testimony that you know no matter what there's something to happen in that man there's something that happened that woman they know they met God on them sacred sands and you couldn't drag it out of them with enough wild annals there's not enough money you could pay them to make him deny the Lord they met something real and that's something to smoke back to them then nothing they run away they ain't giving up oh oh yeah that's what we need to do this once throw off their old wishbone and get a backbone in here some of us need to get the wishbone chuck it out the window you don't need a wishbone in church we're not praising some magic Genie somewhere we're not the dashing hope and so we serve a living God he's never failed it's never been defeated oh mama the Bible tells us listen everybody can have an opinion hey man the men all had an opinion but David had something else here vindication hit the life behind it to back it up hey man the Bible tells us in the book of Acts that Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God how was he approved because the doctor hanging on his wall hey mr. Greenhills lon he didn't have a card in his wallet saying I've been approved by God amen he wasn't on the up somewhere was a five-star review hey many didn't get some accolade from some website on Facebook the Bible says he was approved of God by signs and by one nation let's go stamp of approval and if you're a believer this morning going to stamp - with the seal of his approval the seal the Holy Ghost he's accepted your faith and these sons fall let that be how many believers we got these sons follow them that believe you don't have to chase them you don't have to work it up you don't have to go find it it'll follow you David said goodness unless he followed me they follow me I wasn't chasing after that they followed me all the days of my life hey man that's pretty good listen when you know God has done something you want when you know it's God that dealt with you and it wasn't just you getting worked up and it wasn't just mommy and daddy said so or the deacon said so or the preacher but when you know you met God you can look back and you can see craters and explosions and people falling on the side and yet somehow you made it - he wants a thousand ball your side and ten thousand at your right hand but it won't come my under knew his goodness is mercy they followed you all the days of your life all the days that means even the ones where you're bad even the ones where you want looking for God even the ones where you make a mistake and the broken pieces your life we're all over the ground and you didn't know how you were gonna make it his goodness whose mine see for dinner oh yeah that right he's a witness listen how can I expect to help you or guide you if I don't know what I'm talking about myself hey man all right here and put some ecclesiastical armor on I tell you how good this armor is look that's never been proved in battle yeah that might fall apart from the first stone that hits it usually does that's what happened that man's armor hey you didn't have an argument for her hey man you go tell these people that were sick and now they're well it's like that man had been born behind and they come and interrogate him they brought his mommy and daddy and what happened to your son what's going on who is this season Alan we think he's a sinner I don't know where there's a sit around but there's one thing I know brothers and sisters I might not be able to explain everything this Bibles here I might not be the smartest guy in the message but there's one thing I know brother hey I was blind but now I see I don't know what you think about this message but I know what it did for me he delivered me out of the pit of hell he raised me up he opened my face he gave me overcoming power he gave me job he gave me strength to overcome every Goliath and over enemy of my life huh my fingers I'm very religious a man on the way - he's thankful let me say it again he's faithful this morning I don't know what you're going through maybe you're going through the trolly life right now I'm going through trials you're going through trials and I don't know maybe what you're going through but let me say one thing he's faithful he's never let me down I've been discouraged I've been questioned before sometimes I wonder if not even love me anymore but there's one thing I can say looking like he's been thankful he's never let me down I've let him down but he's never let me down he's never helped me he's never forsaken me he's never giving me up I'm a witness Hubbard a man I believe that's the truth we got to be a witness him in the Holy Ghost is a witness hey man I think well praise the Lord too many times too many times people preachers even they're guilty of standing in the pulpit hey men's summit I'm gonna go there anyhow they're guiltiest in the pulpit and they'll put their ecclesiastical armor on and they're gonna try to lead you and they're gonna try to help you and they're gonna witness some of themselves and man men trying to tell you what the Holy Ghost is and what the Holy Ghost is line and they ain't God and experience themselves with the Holy Ghost what are they gonna lead you to a fake never been in the burning bush how they gonna take you there that man is the truth some money they can preach doctrine they can quote mysteries but they don't know about that power look the Holy Ghost that come and took a hold of your life and it's sanctified you and it clean you up and we pulled you out of the world it's translated you in the kingdom of his dear son it's like I said the new world anymore they know more about Casper the ghost they just holding us and that's the cheers hey man they can talk a big talk hey man they can talk a big talk longer last him they're both snigger me man they can't walk the lock they'll find somebody else while that brothers owns our sister-sons we'll take care of it any men oh praise the Lord listen I don't know about you like I saw my I had a boss I said I had a boss one time and it worked at a restaurant and this guy he owned half the restaurant he was the man my manager it wasn't one very good manager said hey and this guy he didn't run the restaurant the ground he got another one ran into the ground his businesses all failed I looked up here four years ago I wonder what happened to him he's teaching business classes at a college I know why you're laughing hey guys ten million dollars personally ten million dollars in debt I thought I had it rough with my house payment ten million dollars and that is a business all failed he's teaching business classes you know what I said I'm gonna give him water and said to teach me about running a business because the only place he can run the business is into the ground and I don't want to learn from that kind of man I don't wanna lose him saw and isn't clear he might he might impress people with his shiny armor he might get an excited a man but I want to hear from that man I'm gonna hear from that person that knows what it's like when the chips are down and hell's coming against you in your house he's awareness that God is faithful in the darkest times in the bleakest times in the darkest nothing the Holy Ghost kept him that's what the Prophet said when they come in when his wife died his little girl died Billy need to keep your religion through all I said no brew last movie no I didn't keep myself I hate to say it but it's true I didn't keep myself he kept me he's the one that kept me what I wanted to give up what I wanted to run back to daddy's farm and not fighting a lot he's the one that kept me that's the kind of witness that's handling this guy's he's got his button-down shirt on his collar turning around never had a child his life never been tempted some sort of robot in the pulpit I don't need that I need somebody like my Savior he could be touched with my infirmities I want to hear from an almost heart you know what I haven't always been there I haven't always done the right thing but I'm a witness that God is faithful and I'm a witness because he loved me first is why I love him and I'm a witness that he's been faithful and I love him more today I love him more than a day than I've ever loved in the floor because he's proved himself time and time and time again that's the kind of witness I'm looking for that's the kind of witness I want to be that's the kind of witness David was go wasn't boast on as an administrative ability about well how I put a spreadsheet or an excel de de together here's a man after his own heart praising God down the streets when his own wife's making fun of him and you know what God said that's my man that's my son he's praising me and don't matter what his mommy says he don't matter what his wife says he don't matter what the church down the street says I bear witness that's mine I made him a king and he's fall off me laws hard you think about John and Peter when they come to the gate beautiful and there's a man asking for harms hey tell you what they couldn't hurt the bounce checkbook that have any money their holy ghost preachers know silver and gold have we knew but I got something to give you let's see you didn't hand them attraction hey man I'm not against tracks was that somebody handed them a man he didn't have my book he said silver and gold have I none but such as I have your money in the name of Jesus of Nazareth rise up and walk listen a witness has got something to give you too many people in church too many preachers they want to give you a psychology or a hope so or an understanding what we need is awareness I gotta have something to give I can't expect you to give it if I ain't got myself that's truth a man we've got to be a witness of this thing a man in our own lives because our lives listen preachers got to live a sermon him preach hey man you might never preach a sermon in life but you got a live one and people are gonna listen to the sermon in your life your written their living epistle and your story's gonna do something for them your attitude and your testimony can affect the eternal destination about people maybe that person pumping gas next to the gas station somebody work so we just don't know that woman is that did all that washin she washed clothes and paid that evangelist to come to town one kid got saving me she didn't know man I forget what preacher was what Charles Finney oh well praise the Lord that preacher got saved amen well I tell you what I'll give you another one then Charles Spurgeon you ever had ever heard his testimony you know how he got saved he he ducked into the church in a winter storm one night he was looking to go to church other than to get out of the cold amen he went Moody by the way I remembered hey man Charles Bridge inducted the church one night it was so stormy and so cold out that the preacher D even come to church sat in the Haight so there's a shoe cobbler there and all she did he took the text of Isaiah look unto me all the ends of the earth to be saved look and live and he said there's a young man he looked right at that young man caught all that shoe cobbler I mean don't say God can't use your hey man some carnival that suit copper he said young man you coming here tonight I don't know why you come here but let me say this you look under him and live and here's a fifteen year old boy you saw just up just a teenage boy and rebellious young man he said something hate him all the sudden the conviction of the Holy Ghost fell on that young man and he got saved that blizzard in that night in that church said there and the next year he's pastoring a church in London don't tell me God can't take one person and change the whole thing amen he said I ain't know but there's no such thing God didn't save a bunch of nobodies to leave them as nobodies you were not a people but now you are the people of God not a bunch of nobodies anymore maybe the world but in the eyes of God your sons and your daughters with the witness of the Spirit with authority with power with anointing hey man listen got paid to hot price for you pre-heat us run now what he did to you him have that right oh praise the Lord he's so quiet I'm hey man yeah you're worth something to God tell you what you know what the props said you're worth more than the blood of Jesus Christ cuz you are what he paid for with the blood he said if I have oh my I don't know I'm going here all of a sudden he said if I had two drops of the blood of Jesus Christ there's a little jar a little charger oh I I walk different I'd be so careful with how I handled that blood and I'd hold it close to my side and I wouldn't I wouldn't just walking trip I'd be so careful with how I walked and I talked and how I acted just to have to the blood to the drops of blood it's just the chemistry jar how I walk different he said but there's something greater before me tonight the purchase of that blood and how much more careful we ought to be with ourselves one another your what was bought with the blood well shoot anyhow divine vindication Amen we're a witness of it the Bible the Bible says that we stay to show ourselves to be a perfect name and God's approval the witness of the Holy Ghost what is it it's a seal that your faith is really accepted and when you've been accepted a man off the accepted use not gonna reject you later a man maybe you feel rejected this Martin look he rejected you he accepted you you were accepted in the beloved a man then maybe you don't feel that maybe let me testify this morning as a witness you're accepted by the blood of Jesus Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey man I see a witness this won't come to this a witness what makes them powerful is their influence and then your witness is what kind of an influence you have on people that's why we have to be so careful with one another because listen you can murder somebody without a pro tonight without ever putting a knife in the back you can murder their influence hey man so we've got to be careful with one another because that witness or the influence that's part of what God has given them a man if I come before you this morning I preached and maybe I just preached a great sermon I'd like to do that one time just preach a great sermon I get done I go ahead I start smoking and saying every kind of thing in the world and this enough you would have no confidence in what I was saying even if it were true hey man because I ruined the witness or my influence now listen you've all got influence somewhere in your life you've got influence over somebody give you a witness as a gift for a reason and it's not for yourself amen people see something in you that's different the Roman centurion saw something in Jesus that was different and I'm bringing myself my second point here and he saw that this was a man with authority now David it says here he was giving us up to the other witness the people is as a leader not where leaders actually a sovereign or somebody it means a ruler somebody in a position of authority and this is what the Centurion saw in Jesus this is what David had him and he didn't make himself a king he didn't get a gang one day so we're gonna overthrow the nation we're gonna rule by by force from no God made him a king God gave him authority when Jesus come the Roman centurion said this is a man with authority I recognized it because I myself am a man under Authority amen so no she notices he has authority because he's a man under Authority I want you to think about I'm gonna segue here for a second I want you to think about this Roman centurion because Jesus compliments him with a really good compliment well the highest praises you could ever hear from the Savior ah he marveled that this man's great faith in men he said I've not seen such great faith not at all Israel see the secret his great faith was understanding Authority hey man he understood Authority he said I have men if I tell one to go guess what it goes I don't have to argue with him I left um six times I don't have to ride him up at work I don't have to reprimand him and off from a bigger race I come to go he does it I tell one to come any customs I say do this guess what he does you don't argue at me you don't fuss with that like some of us do wanna somebody like some of us do no let's just do something right now about that Lord listen if you understand Authority you do what you're told hey man listen if that's if that soldier didn't do what he was told he didn't just get a slap on the wrist they'd whip them or beat him they'd even killed him a man and this Roman sentries as I understand how authority works because I'm a man under Authority now notice we all love to have authority for a second we all love to wield authority jesus said that the Gentiles exercise dominion over one another we all love to be the boss we all love the wheel authority but nobody wants to listen to Authority hey man this roman centurion said i understand how authority works I'm a man under Authority these men don't listen to me because I'm smarter than them or because I'm stronger than them or because of whatever cuz I come up there a kind of a house they listen to me because I've been given a position by the authority it's over me unless if you're a son or daughter of God the Devils don't listen to you this morning because you're smarter than them the Devils don't have to flee when you command them because you're so strong or because you got the right kind of an Arsenal in their house but because you're under the authority of the king of kings and the Lord of lords you're a son you're a daughter of God amen you've been placed in the position of authority hey men when I listen if you have authority that means you have to submit see Authority is submission they're the two sides of the same coin you can't have authority without submission otherwise nobody submits to you so notice when a ruler has character they don't they don't wield their authority like a sword and Karen people down I think was Aristotle it was Aristotle said that he said he that cannot be a good follower cannot be a good leader and then let's say I met many people they want to run a church they want to run your life and they'll tell you how to run it to the quick to volunteer information about how to run your life and they want to tell everybody how to run their live and they'll tell her but in the church what to do and they're all old Hoss ain't even in order and they came to submit to God they can't sit under a pastor can't submit to Authority and I'm thinking why do I want to listen to you you don't listen hey Manuel we gots the fun part of the service hey man I mean I know I should be careful I know preachers like that they won't sit under a pastor but they want to preach to everybody and what kind of a model are you or what are you modeling to people if you can't submit to Authority why do you expect people to submit to you well sure hey man well the Apostle Paul dealt with that first Corinthians 14 verse 37 he said if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord him in other words it everybody have their own Psalm their own time their own do their own their own thing and Paul said well that's fine but if you're gonna do that you have to acknowledge first this is the words of Lord I mean you can't come to vindicate a promise say well I got a better idea no you don't you might have a better idea than that man but you don't have a better idea than that saith the Lord and then people will come and they'll argue it's a word and they'll argue with a messenger they did the same thing in Paul's day and they'll argue with the word a little argument promote their idea they don't understand Authority they don't really have authority because they won't submit hey man listen when you I might I might share this before hey man but listen when you when you under my authority you're actually undermining your own witness it's true amen you think about David Luiz David because I'm preaching about David you think about David when he finds King Saul in a cave one day this man is ordained to be a king he's been anointed and he's wandered and he's fought Philistines he's been to Ziklag he's done all this and finally here's King Saul the only thing that's standing in his way they're taking the throne and he finds him sleeping in the cave and David has an opportunity to slay this man now listen this man tried to kill him more than once this man's been haunting him like a dog and chased him down he got every reason it's slang this man and he finds me cave he says I can't doing shall I touch the Lord's anointed him be blameless he said when he had yet not brother listen he understood that God had kept him in the wilderness God had anointed him God had preserved him when he fought Goliath when he fought the Philistines when he wasn't running from Saul he survived he overcome because that anointing on his life that was what given the power of her that's what made him a ruler her that's what give him a right to these things that anointing on his alive that was the only thing that made the difference and maybe it wasn't cause he was taller than the rest of his brother it wasn't all these other things Saul's hadn't show his phone everybody else a man but that anointing was the only thing that made the difference every spear and every giant every enemy could not overcome an anointing that was the power we say this way you know if you're talking about books or something hid plot armor he's the main character he can't die at plot armor then anointing kept and I was only the reason he stayed alive I'm a man and how I comes to saw but this man's also been anointed a lot of the groups that that preacher says I think he's wrong well he might be they still knowing it he's still called and you have to be careful I gotta be careful at the pulpit I don't undermine that guy or his influence because the same anointing that has me here is the same anointing which called him yeah he might be wrong at times Saul was wrong still anointed still called to be a king is that right it's not listen it wasn't David's job to get rid of salt God take care of that if he asked - hey man - under to come against Saul is to come against the very anointing that kept him alive it would be he would be under a be saying annoying was good enough for me but not for soft hey man he would be undermining the very authority that kept him it's powerful hey man praise the Lord I believe I believe or the RAM was that kind of a man a man he was sitting as a the Bible I'm sorry the Bible says that David was sent as a leader is that right brother brain one goes beyond the curtain of time the voice is speaking to him and he sees the people that are gathered and he said that you were sent to the earth to be a leader hey man I believe that man was anointed for that message a man I believe he's a seventh angel in the seventh Church age hey man he's more than just the teacher to me he's more than just a good Bible scholar look that's what so many people they look at this prophet that's why they argue with the word that's why the fight was a message because brother bran is just another man to them but to me I recognize that the anointing in his life that's the same anointing that's kept me that's kept you that's brought us here today and Who am I to speak against it Who am I to come against it well that's the very power that brought us here amen I think about that he's more than just a man he's a leader is that right so we have authorities all right we have a witness you know let me say it this way taught my undermining Authority if I go home and somebody my pastor preaches and every time he preaches I go home and I find something wrong I tell my wife and I tell my kids man he don't know what he's talking about I don't do this he don't know what he's talking about he's wrong list now after a while they're not gonna listen to that man and after a while they're not gonna listen to me and I show up to church late and I skip church not come when I feel like it and my kids get older and after a while they learn in church and they won't listen to Authority mommy's always running that down home and daddy don't know what he's talking about and I'm the kids won't listen to mommy why not cuz Mommy can't listen nobody and daddy can't listen nobody he won't listen to the boss at work he won't Amen someone we want everybody to listen to us well hallelujah you can't have authority without submission amen you know program says this in the palace prison he says that man is omnipotent hey man whoa something got quiet on me there you didn't know you're omnipotent idiot you just thought you were him man is omnipotent he says a man that's fully surrendered to God he's omnipotent listen you have just as much power as you can submit to God yes I wish I had more power I wish I could walk in authority submit to God listen everybody wants to devil to run away from them well the Bible says resist the devil he'll flee from you yeah but it says therefore submit yourselves unto God resist the devil and he'll flee from here nobody wants to change the devil away but nobody wants to submit to God listen you want to run the devil out of your house you want to run the devil out of this church this morning submit to the Word of God submit to the authority of God that's where your power comes from not from trying to bully him or getting louder trying to bluster him you can't Bluff the bluffer but he knows a real thing when he sees that hey man the devil's new when Jesus walked in the bear hunting here comes the son of the Most High didn't have interrogating didn't have to figure it out mister fall on the floor as soon as he walked in because they recognized a son of God with authority and how about that's this morning well hallelujah we ought to be so submitted to God this woman do when we walk in the sick get healed in our shadow we don't have to even speak a word and the Devils tremble we get too busy with other things it's time to come back to God and select a man my mom making a leader hey man you say you know I'm gonna pass her and Deacon we were leading somebody somewhere somebody's watching you listen the Bible's getting ahead of myself here but the Bible says Amen that you're going to rule and you're gonna reign he's called us to be kings and priests say what are you getting half wherever you're at in life now whatever you're doing one day you're gonna rule and one day you're gonna rain if you're a Christian if you're faithful you're gonna rain is that right you might have authority over ten cities you might have authority over five you might even have authority over one city whatever it is you're called to be a king priest a man and how you gonna rule over them cities can't even rule over your own life can you rule over your own flesh come on somebody help me out now you can't get a hold of that devil in your life and kick him out of your house how are you gonna rule the earth if you don't advocate will you say well you know if I had that kind of care you know if if I had I see this all the time I see with people all the time well you know if I had this this again if I had this kind of a church I had this and that if if I had a bigger ministry that has nothing to do with her jesus said he that's faithful little it's faithful and much if you can't be faithful with what you got now why do you think God's gonna trust you with the kingdom that's the truth amen I want to talk about this last part here I like this he says give us a witness a leader and a commander to the people it's word for commander in the Hebrews actually a verb it's one who gives commands it seems kind of pedantic but it's actually what he's saying is it's someone who makes effectual commands a man it's a verb to someone who gives commands so an effective leader they have have influence they're a ruler they have authority you have Authority in your life you have influence but there's something else and I think many times this remote many of us fail amen he gives clear commands where he issues commands to the people amen so an effective ruler knows how to give direction that's what it is amen many times we're guilty of coming to church come to church and we'll warm up you will pray maybe we're doing all the right things but somewhere in our life we lost our ambition somewhere my life we lost our direction and we're just kind of floating through life hoping to make it by but a real leader a real ruler me and my home I have a having ambitions for my family for my children you know I got one he wants to go to space well well I'm gonna surpass that anyway Hey they have different dreams I have different ambitions they they do different things when in school differently amen that's not good and fine and whether they're well I won't want to be a doctor I mean a mechanic and need a lawyer there's somebody do my hair yeah then I'm set for life amen but what do they do that or whether they flip burgers or whatever happens a lot I've got one ambition for them that's more important than all those things I want them to be Christians I don't want them to live off my testimony I don't want just to go to church I want them to meet the same God then I'll mind on them sacred Satan's listen it's not always easy I'll give a testimony huh actually I've never I've never preached this before money give it here ma my one daughter she come up one time at an altar service I was preaching and she got down she started praying and God was just really deal with her I'm telling this for a reason I hope you catch this amen I don't claim to be an expert parent but this is just just me amen and she's down there praying and I went and I prayed with her and I almost stopped I said there there sweetheart now you don't have to cry more it's okay I stopped myself I stopped myself you know why because I realize not just about question Spirit of God God's deal with her and maybe she's going through things and God's trying to work in her life and if we're not careful we try to make their life easier for him we try to comfort them and we try to give them consolation and if we're not careful we let that take the place of the Holy Ghost being their counselor and the Holy Ghost given their comfort if we're not careful we'll do that I will rob her of that experience with my gnats you see philia loves one thing but a golf he loves a whole nother thing God let you go through trials gotta let you go through things he'll let you maybe just sweat it out sometimes and you think I always got to help me out maybe he's trying to get you somewhere maybe is trying to restore your sense of direction and then because it's not just given directions given the right kind interaction and sometimes God's got to get a hold of our attention and then that would have been the wrongs I I had to go and sit down cuz I watched filial love trying to take its place and know God's dealing with her and then as parents we've got to be careful what kind of a vision we put before our children amen hey man the Bible tells us that you know you know we look at Abraham and Abraham was chosen not because his people were the greatest people the Bible says even the weakest of all people do you know why God chose Abraham from all the people of the earth the Bible tells you why Genesis chapter 18 it says shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do seem that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him watch this verse 19 for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment why let the Lord may bring upon Abraham that what she has spoken of him God knew if I give Abraham a vision if I give him a direction he'll instruct his children he'll teach his children he'll train his household after him you said I don't know how well he did well let me tell you what he did when they well his wife Sarah died he went down and bought a field and the plains of Mamre bought a pot of land from the sons of Heth and he went and bought a place to bury her because he'd seen something he'd seen something that the Lord was gonna raise up a people one day there was gonna be a resurrection he saw taking place hey man so he goes he puts his wife in that field and his children after him go there and when Jacobs down in Egypt he said my children all kinds of darkness if you trade a child the way that they should go they'll not richer don't come up right amen he'll not depart when he's older your child might be in Egypt right now ha ha but there was something in Jacobs life through all this betrayal and all the nonsenses in his life there was something anybody was down there in Egypt so don't bury me down there how are they back where the resurrection we're gonna be when Joseph's getting ready to die he'd been instructed don't leave me down here you'll be here years but when you come up don't leave my bones down here in Egypt I savor him did a pretty good job they knew so much about her one to carry his dead bones cliff you're a promise through a woman's the promised land a man a hip her hair have instructed them hey man they knew there was a right place to be buried you know let's talk about Moses earlier I had this thought here just a few months ago Moses the age of 40 he goes to deliver the people of God and bring him out of Egypt and take him there with justice bones and all and he goes to do that when of course we know the story he fails and I thought to myself when I said what if he had succeeded what if at the age of 40 he'd overthrown the Egyptians and grabbed all them people and he walked on the wilderness where was he gonna go he'd never been to the promised land he he didn't have a map he didn't have a compass or an asteroid what was he gonna do and then see he had to meet the burning bush first because that fire was what was gonna lead him to the promised land that's why we've got to meet that burning bush we can have all kinds of ideas we can make a bigger building we can get more people who without the Holy Ghost to lead us in the right direction how can we give the people the right direction many times as I said many times as leaders that's where we fail we fail to put a vision before the people this is what God wants for you without a vision the people perish hey man without a vision becomes an uncertain sounds I write with a if a trumpet gives uncertain sound if I'm up here and I say well God's real day is not the next I believe the message I don't that's it how can that take you anywhere that's an uncertain sound name ahead who how you gonna get ready for the battle hey listen it's the job of a leader you think about David when he was down there in cyclic David I'm talking about David this mornin a man when he's down there he's Ziklag and all them people come against him and then that feels she's had come they taking his wives they taking his children they taking all these things from him there wasn't one person that camp that was on David's side they all got mad at David and said you know what you let us down David and the Bible says he was greatly distressed because they took up stones well he didn't know he was preaching that Sunday the whole congregation was packing a bunch of stones man David you don't messed up we're gonna get you now David I knew you'd let us down he didn't know one person back him up but the Bible says he began to encouraged himself in the Lord bless the Lord O my soul and know that's within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who redeemeth thy lap with loving-kindness who healeth all that he began encouraged himself like he did there that day with song cuz it's his job he's the leader he's the one that's got to give them a direction when everybody else is discouraged how many times you come in here maybe you were discouraged maybe you're just so distraught listen well praise the Lord we all deal with discouragement you can admit it maybe you come in here so discouraged maybe maybe so defeated feeling as a Christian and the pastor get up and he began to preach something and before you know you hear your visions been restored and maybe that's what the devil wants to take from you first is your vision just like he did with Sampson a man he wants to take that vision listen if you're just going to work to make them living amen if you're just coming to church to be seen of people that's not gonna hold you but when but when the enemy is coming against you and your wife is gone your children are going everybody speaking yes you that's when it's the time to remember you super God you belong to a kingdom that cannot be moved it's greater him impulsive that none of these things move me he caught a hold of something he had a vision of a kingdom hallelujah some money he said Oh death where is lasting I'm persuaded there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God the man says this he says you know leaders sometimes got some leaders here this morning I believe him huh maybe you don't have an office or position but you got some leaders here this is you know leaders sometimes go through things that the congregation don't know what they're going through you pray for your pastor when you think of the promises God has made and why don't it come to pass they don't tell their congregation they don't tell the people they associate with but there's many frustrations in the heart of a real leader I believe David knew what that was like he says many times we're forced to do things and say things that we don't want to say in a real spiritual leader he's forced to do it he has to take his side and show his colors I'll take the way with the Lord's despise for you hey man brother Graham says they're same ham but listen I think this is I think it's important amen because like I said we're going through things and many times we're like that we there's some things you just can't tell people hey man there's just some things you just have to hide in your heart sometimes you got questions amen and that's the time to remember the vision that you're serving amen we're going to a future home we're going somewhere amen this isn't where it ends this isn't where it stops this isn't all it's meant to be the best these aren't just behind us we're going somewhere we're going to the promised land we're going to a land that flows with milk and honey sometimes we get discouraged even brother ben says this ever-present water from the rock he says I'm he says I'm supposed to they very odd person to many people he says I'm kind of odd to myself although I feel good about that he says because I tried to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit just as close as I can and that makes us odd see we do things that we sit down and we wonder sometimes why did I do such a thing I could sit there all day I've done that in my life before where it was a mistake I'm talking about when you know this God spoke to you why did I do such thing how did I ever do that and right then you may think you've done exactly what you should not have done but if you'll just be patient have faith and you're sure that God has led you to do it you'll find out it works just exactly right and many times we find that he says I know brother Neville has fought many times leaders and spiritual people realize that and then sometimes God will put you in the thick of it man and you you might I think I told my testimony when I when I was working in the factory and I quit to go overseas I went not I'd prayed about because I was quitting my job to have any prospects and I handed my resignation in I put my foot like three weeks they were actually shocked because everybody just walks out I put my two weeks in I knew God spoke to me and I hand that in and they tried to stop me I said no the Lord has called me to go such in such a place I walked out of there ten foot tall I'll be honest with you the next day I didn't feel that way next day I woke up and I was at home and said I just quit my job I've got nothing lined up when I come home what an idiot I'll tell you I'm counting how much money's in the bag trying to figure it out I'm like man I don't even know how many make it by the first month on your back didn't even know what I was gonna do and I'll be real honest with y'all just just between you me I felt like the biggest in the world I thought about go man officer problem from a job I'm still here let me stay hey man I didn't know he's feeling I got some frustrations but yet I knew that God spoke to me and right um it seemed like the biggest mistake of my life well my wife and kids are gonna start well as you can tell I didn't starve maybe I could have burnt a star a little bit more a man but I've never seen the righteous forsaken I've never seen a seed begging bread he was faithful I'm a witness hey man mom you think about that sometimes we get in the thick of it we think we made the biggest mistake the one God's got you exactly where he wants you god that's exactly what I want say man we've got to stand up to the enemy when nobody else wants to do it amen oh yeah I think I think they say that 90% of people do or 10% people do 90% of the work the most jobs anyhow that's about the truth of it amen somewhere in our life we've got to own up and be a real leader in a home whether it's your children your wife whatever it is amen we can't wait for somebody else to do an amen well that's where I come to my my finale here ain't man I was praying one time this is a few months back the Lord woke me up in the middle of night I was getting ready to preach somewhere and I woke up Sunday morning two o'clock in the morning and God was dealing me about Shammi our brother Ian preached about sharing guard and even preach it that day but I was just telling me about this and I was thinking about Shamgar you know we talked about this man there's one word in the Bible another brim heap dramatizes this one scripture on the Bible here's a man a judge of Israel and he's been called for a purpose amen you know it's funny cuz we read these stories in the Bible like the newspaper some time we don't always think about the backstory there and I thought about Shamgar I thought about myself as a young man oh you know when I first got married I met the girl my dreams and I had I had everything and I was just thinking about how you know we know things don't always end the way they start out and that's where we lose our vision sometimes and I was thinking about Shamgar he'd probably been raised in a farm taking care of the oxen and he meets the girl of his dreams hey man and they decide to get married one day and his family gives them big old shiny rocks gold for his wedding gift and he's out there moving the oxen and he's got he's a strapping young man and that's her knight in shining armor he's just having the time of his life and he's so happy being a newlywed every day is a honeymoon well don't let stay that way one day the Philistines come on and he had a couple children maybe and he had his life they'd be doing this for me five ten years and one man the devil come along one day a bunch of Philistines come along and said you know what you're gonna pay us tribute never I didn't plan for that on his wedding day and then I've had to go through things my wife's had to go through things I didn't plan for when I got married for better for worse amen and he don't know what to do and he does the only only sensible thing a man could do well he pays them cuz I gotta take care of my wife and kids well you know what they come back the next year and they come back the next year and the ox goes getting a little rusty and thus his shoulders are beginning to stoop a little bit he ain't getting any younger things aren't getting any better but the ramesses they start starving his his wife and kids are wearing rags there's their faces are hollowed out from starvation and things aren't getting better he's probably saying you know I'm gonna wait for the right time I'm gonna wait for the right time to get a hold of this in my life somewhere this will change them they'll get all they'll stop coming they'll get enough food things weren't getting any better the longer he let it go on the worst of gosh and he's just getting older and the wrinkles are running and running on his face and he's just getting hungry and they're just getting weaker and the house is getting more rundown and he lets it go year after year come them steps to them armored soldiers coming up the lanes and he got to a place he got ready to hear he heard him every year he expected it amen he wasn't learning how to be more spiritual all than here's he wasn't learning how to pray and breakthrough he wasn't learning how to trust in God the only thing he learned all them years was how to resign himself to defeat and many of us if we're not careful we get to a place maybe there's a sickness in your life maybe there's something in your home and you get to place where you say you know what it's always been this way and she's always gonna be this way if you're not careful you resign yourself to defeat listen that's not the time that's a tongue for some leadership that's the time to step off hey man listen people are looking to him here's his wife looking to hit him say where's the man that I married where's my knight in shining armor I murdered a man that said he would take care of me and he was he was the biggest and he was the most handsome and he was the best and I murdered a man he was my knight in shining armor and now also sees a mouse now as he sees a coward what happened to her prayer life what happened to our devotions at home we used to seek God we used to get down on her knees and now he's too busy with work and now he's too busy with social activities and he's too busy with everything else what is the man that I'm married how big you think about his kids as I got kids my kids they're like they're like most kids they think that it can beat anybody my daddy's the biggest and he's the strongest and he can whip anybody he's the best Christian he's the smartest I'll tell you what they're in for a rude awakening amen praise the Lord kids grow up after huh and they see daddy they're waiting for daddy daddy do something these are grown men these are soldiers coming to our house year after year and my daddy taught me God gave us this land my daddy taught me that God could defeat anybody he taught me that God is greater that God could defeat any enemy daddy taught me all these sins daddy don't believe in himself daddy says he believes this message but daddy don't believe it because he he lives under tribute year after year the same Devils I thought my daddy was tough I thought my husband was a real man he had nothing but a coward he's nothing but a weakling he finds himself a broken down man a shell of what he used to be you know what maybe you find yourself in this morning that's not the end of the story I'm so glad I met her many people story ends right there but there's something to happen to him one day he threw out the wishbone he got a backbone he said you know I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I'm tired of people looking now I'm tired of my wife waiting for me to show up and me being raps and tea husband and me being an absentee father and me being an absentee Christian I'm trying to live it this way I'm sick of watching them suffer cuz I fail to stand up for the promise of God what will I do he found that ol ox code all wasn't as shiny when sits freeze first cease to be amen the little bottles got some dust on it the family altar is a little torn down but he picked up that rusty old Oscar and said it's still more than enough this rock down ruined tests only God can take it and raise it off it's still more than enough to whip every Philistine no whip every devil he took the rocks coat look he won went for the neighbor down the street to do it he wasn't waiting for the pastor to pray through for him he picked up the rock scout and he marched out there he said this is a different man when I popped my field this year I did a little extra work I've dug some grains out back this is the day there's a grave up behind my house and one of us is gonna be filling that grave at the end of the day and it ain't gonna be me brothers and sisters if I were you I'd start trying I'd stop trying to compromise with the devil and negotiate with the devil dig him a grave and stick him in the ground it's time to look him right in the eye and say you know what I'm through with you depression I'm through with you I'm through with my joy being home I'm through the devil taking my peace I'm done with the devil taking my house I'm don't you grain I'm gonna stick you in the rain and I'm gonna bury you you ain't gonna come up and then you gonna remember your name [Applause] his name's only mentioned once well that's more than the Philistines are mentioned I don't know any of their names I don't care about what their names are I know it don't matter what the name of your problem is this morning we got some sham dollars here gonna stick them in the ground say you ain't marching down an old dusty path anymore I'm gonna be the kind of husband my wife's looking for I'm gonna be the kind of daddy my kids are looking for I'm really kind of Christian that people are looking for if nobody else on my block wants to do it I'm gonna whip every one of them by the grace of God it's time to it's time to stand up you stand you can actually stand up it's time to stand up hey man listen you might be like Schindler you might feel trapped right now you might feel like this you're never gonna change but let me tell you what I can tell you right now amen Shem Gor can testify David can testify my best days they're not behind me they're in front of me you might have gone through sickness you might go through the battle your last but let me testify they don't have to end this way your best day it's not behind you somebody say my best days not behind me hey man I'll be the best is yet to come you believe that this is the best this brass Oh hallelujah don't let the devil lie to you with the internet and a bunch of false preachers this Brides not defeated she's not weak she's stronger than she's ever been this bride is greater gone in this bride it's greater than he's ever better than the age he's held with the darkness over the deception look at the God that we serve his greater than whatever you're going through you begin to testify to your glass my God's greater than bear he's greater than a line he's greater than you he's greater than the sickness of my life he's greater than the suppression of my life you start telling your mountain about the God that you serve we're not backing now we're not turning around and then he didn't give us the power to run from Devils they give us a part of cast am i hey listen don't let your life oh don't let your life be led be ruled by resentment and days gone by God used to this my best days are behind me let's not encourage you and maybe nobody else is encouraged you lately I would encourage you hey man that's what David did he encouraged himself amen it gonna be times or maybe you're all by yourself I want you to remember this word I want you to encourage yourself in the Lord hey man you know I love that story about when David goes dick hack you know what happen he come back and he took everything the devil stole from it didn't love leave one thing behind everything that devil stole from him he took it back and then some he actually come out with more spoil when he come back and you know what David did the Bible says he went and sent gifts to the elders of Judah and all of his friends and it became a custom in Israel wouldn't you like to have so much victory this morning this afternoon amen would you like to have so much joy would you like to have such an overcoming testimony you got enough to share with somebody in church you can turn to your brothers and say you know I got so much I want to share with you let's just brother Alex I got such a testimony I'm going to tell you what God did for me I've got so much overcoming right now okay that's the kind of overcoming I want I want so much I got to give amen bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord as we come now to the end of the preaching but we see many people in our lives living like Shamgar they've resigned themselves through a fait living as a defeated Christian living in defeat to the enemy maybe they think it's always gonna be this way Lord what they need right now huh what they need right now is is more than just a blessing but they need right now more than just just a feeling or an emotion they need a real breakthrough then he they need to really just settle it with the enemy once and for all they just really need to dig that grave look their enemy in the eye see if this is it one of us isn't going home today they need a real break sure Lord maybe if you won't here lift their hand say I need that breakthrough in my life hands going up over the bend God sees your hand and the devil sees your hand you let him know right now I'm I'm lifting my hand up as a sign I'm burying you in a grave today we're gonna settle it once and for all I've got my sword wrong this is the end you ain't coming back to my home again I ain't deal with you another day you might have dealt with them for years Saints but this is the day you take your sword and you're running through you take your ox coat and you run that every first thing don't just hit a watch you put them in a grave and you bury him and you forget his name and you let the devil know I'm never this is my deliverance this is my breakthrough this is the day all changes my best but best days in front of me Heavenly Father you see the hands going up right now I believe that the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit would come and break every yoke break every chain break every fetter Lord your dissolver of doubts you cast out the darkness by your marvelous life lumen you come in strength and in power break down every wall shatter every cell of oppression and chains of
