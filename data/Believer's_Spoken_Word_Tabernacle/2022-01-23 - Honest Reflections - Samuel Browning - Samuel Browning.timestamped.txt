[23:12] is mine
[23:14] the message is
[23:17] [Music]
[23:22] i told satan to get me behind for this
[23:27] message
[23:45] and it's just such a
[23:47] such an encouragement and you
[23:48] hear just the
[23:50] songs that's being sung and you know the
[23:52] channel that god has
[23:54] and it's just
[23:55] it's just always refreshing
[23:57] it's so important you know when we
[24:00] i think years ago
[24:02] probably now almost 19 years ago and
[24:06] maybe more than that
[24:07] just looking at some things you know
[24:09] sometimes you know we look at the
[24:12] importance of the word and the word is
[24:13] very important
[24:15] there's got to be an atmosphere that's
[24:16] set
[24:17] and the word itself sets an atmosphere
[24:19] and it to where that in our lives to
[24:22] invite his presence but you think of how
[24:25] that without worship there's always been
[24:27] worship that goes before the word coming
[24:30] and we want to be able to receive the
[24:31] word we
[24:33] we know that in ourselves sometimes you
[24:35] know if we can look at the honesty of
[24:37] god's prophet that he could say sitting
[24:39] in that back office when he could say he
[24:42] said my spirit was all tore up he said
[24:44] from everything he said but this song
[24:46] service
[24:47] it made a way
[24:49] and we just we know that's so important
[24:51] you know any any person who's ever done
[24:53] anything with athletics or whatever more
[24:55] and especially as you get older you
[24:57] realize you've got to stretch in order
[24:58] maybe hang pictures you know
[25:00] but when you you know if you don't
[25:02] stretch you risk injury
[25:04] stretch is a lot of times it's some of
[25:06] those things sometimes it can be
[25:07] seemingly laborious you look at huh i
[25:09] don't really want to stretch i don't
[25:11] want to take the 15 minutes and 20
[25:13] minutes but it's important
[25:15] and that's what real worship is it's
[25:17] it's just getting loose
[25:19] you just press in there sometimes you
[25:20] you know you say well really i don't
[25:22] always feel like it but that's the time
[25:24] to sacrifice a praise
[25:26] that's a time just to start just you
[25:28] know like paul and then they just
[25:29] started tapping their foot
[25:31] they just started entering in and began
[25:33] to think about the goodness of god
[25:35] that's what happened with elijah when
[25:37] they brought that minstrel there it just
[25:39] changed the whole situation
[25:41] and we're no different than what they
[25:43] were
[25:44] we still we deal with this human part
[25:47] this part of us that is weak but thanks
[25:50] be to god we've got wisdom to know where
[25:52] to go for help
[25:54] when we need help to say hey turn on
[25:56] some good gospel music
[25:58] turn on some instrumental music we we
[26:00] know we have we god has given us
[26:02] direction in that because after all
[26:04] there is even god will heal
[26:07] even by music
[26:09] amen i think how many pro how many
[26:11] individuals i don't know what i'm saying
[26:12] is i'm just saying it but how many went
[26:14] through the prayer line and brother
[26:16] branham even stopped different sisters
[26:17] that dealt with gloom about their life
[26:21] and brother brahm told her he said he
[26:22] told him he said now you go from here
[26:25] you play some snappy gospel tunes
[26:30] snappy
[26:31] you play some snappy gospel tunes and
[26:33] then he refers it back to how in his
[26:36] trailer or the the office that he had he
[26:39] said
[26:40] i keep that going in my office he said
[26:44] with billy he said to keep that
[26:45] atmosphere there
[26:47] and that's there's a way you get to feel
[26:49] a little bit down and you get you know
[26:51] you say oh i should be reading i should
[26:53] be praying we'll understand that but
[26:55] just put on some music
[26:57] just put on some music just put on some
[26:59] you know do like little drake has his
[27:01] mama do he has he has sister rebecca put
[27:04] on the services here and he plays his
[27:05] drums and he uses his microphone and
[27:08] they have service all over again
[27:12] so
[27:13] oh how we just love the lord
[27:15] just little simple things like that but
[27:17] we're simple people and we want the
[27:19] desires just that the lord would just
[27:21] have his way in our in our lives
[27:24] we want to just look into the word of
[27:26] the lord but maybe before we turn our
[27:29] bibles here and i'm going to have you
[27:30] turn to daniel chapter 9
[27:33] this morning
[27:36] but we just want to look to the lord in
[27:37] a word of prayer and as you're turning
[27:39] there just want to give an update on
[27:42] sister linda or my aunt linda you know
[27:45] this
[27:46] at the beginning here
[27:48] my goodness my days are all mixed up mom

[28:20] had to call them over the past year and
[28:22] a half

[28:38] but if you're in 45 they tell you to be

[31:29] as we invite you lord god just to have
[31:32] your way we ask it in the name of jesus
[31:35] christ amen
[31:38] amen let's read here in daniel chapter
[31:41] nine i'm just going to read just a few
[31:44] verses of scripture and we'll let you be
[31:46] seated
[31:47] in daniel chapter 9
[31:50] verse 1
[31:51] it says in the first year of darius the
[31:53] son of a hezrus of the seed of the medes
[31:56] which was king over the realm of the
[31:59] chaldeans
[32:00] in the first year of his reign
[32:03] i daniel understood
[32:06] by books the number of the years
[32:09] whereof the word of the lord came to
[32:11] jeremiah the prophet
[32:13] that he would accomplish
[32:15] 70 years
[32:17] in the desolations of jerusalem
[32:20] amen may god bless the reading of the
[32:22] word as you're being seated
[32:25] i'd like to just
[32:27] just draw from there just just for a few
[32:29] moments here and i'm not going to i'm
[32:31] not going to keep you long and
[32:33] i want you to pray that that'll be true
[32:37] but i just want to look just at a
[32:38] thought here this morning just some
[32:40] things that as we've been looking in on
[32:43] prayer
[32:44] and i just
[32:47] thought as of from even
[32:49] there was another direction i was going
[32:50] to go but just here
[32:52] one day just being in prayer here
[32:54] hearing the lord just spoke to my heart
[32:57] i just want to speak here on on a
[33:00] thought honest
[33:02] reflections
[33:04] honest reflections
[33:07] daniel we read here
[33:09] daniel being a prophet of god
[33:12] daniel was directed and he said he
[33:15] understood by the books the number of
[33:17] the years
[33:19] whereof the word of the lord came to
[33:21] jeremiah the prophet remember it had
[33:23] been prophesied
[33:25] through jeremiah that there was going to
[33:27] be
[33:28] 70 years that
[33:30] israel
[33:31] would be out of the land and in
[33:33] captivity
[33:34] and when we look at this time i want to
[33:37] just move just into that word of
[33:39] understanding
[33:40] because
[33:41] we know that understanding itself when
[33:44] we're speaking of this here in verse 2
[33:47] it's more than an understanding of just
[33:50] a natural man's mind
[33:53] any man can put scripture to scripture
[33:55] to scripture together
[33:58] but it takes god to put it in order
[34:02] you see many times when you can look
[34:04] even at times in theologians in the past
[34:07] and men that have lived and i'm not i'm
[34:09] talking
[34:11] men of god that have lived before that
[34:13] they could look into things
[34:16] such as here in the book of daniel and
[34:18] look in many places and they could write
[34:20] certain commentaries on things
[34:23] those that could even look into
[34:25] church ages and so forth but to
[34:28] understand that there are things that
[34:29] they were looking at and glimpses that
[34:32] was there
[34:33] but the difference when it understanding
[34:35] comes from god
[34:37] that is something that can only be given
[34:40] in a designated time
[34:42] man has a desire to seek god man has a
[34:45] desire to know god's will and that that
[34:48] really comes to our hearts as believers
[34:51] with everything about our life is we
[34:54] desire to know god's will
[34:57] and so understanding is is something
[35:00] that you know sometimes like brother
[35:02] branham brought that up with the man at
[35:04] work and they read about the book of
[35:06] revelation said who can understand it
[35:08] you know and he made the comment you
[35:09] know john must have had a hot pepper
[35:11] supper and things like that brother
[35:12] branham told him even then he said it
[35:14] could have cost me my job but i told the
[35:16] man shame on you
[35:18] and he and he spoke even in that moment
[35:20] that when god gets ready when it's time
[35:22] for god to reveal something because
[35:24] that's a principle in god's word then
[35:26] god will reveal it and it's his spirit
[35:29] that comes forth to make it known to
[35:32] those who it's intended for that they
[35:35] would understand
[35:36] and so daniel is here in this moment and
[35:39] he's looking in
[35:40] into what was spoken there by jeremiah
[35:44] and the understanding that god begins to
[35:47] impart to jeremiah and our to daniel in
[35:50] this time and i just want to just just
[35:52] move here on this this thought of
[35:54] understanding that understanding as we
[35:56] said moments ago it's more than just as
[35:59] brother brown would say it a student
[36:00] comparing verse to verse now we all know
[36:03] the scripture says study
[36:05] is that right
[36:06] but the bible also says in the book of
[36:08] proverbs much study weary of a person
[36:11] so it shows it's not conflicting but
[36:13] it's to move in the channel that god is
[36:16] giving in that hour
[36:18] things that god has many times you hear
[36:20] brother bran will say now write this
[36:22] down you can look at it when you get
[36:23] home you can read over when you get home
[36:25] you can pray over it when you get home
[36:27] so it's study in line and in tune with
[36:31] god's mind so we're not i'm thankful god
[36:34] hasn't left it up to you or us to me to
[36:36] try to figure out our own way
[36:39] god in this hour has has sent to you and
[36:42] i the message straight from the throne
[36:44] of god that we don't have to figure out
[36:47] we don't have to figure out
[36:49] all we have to do is believe
[36:53] and when we believe it shows itself in
[36:56] our own lives
[36:58] because after all real understanding
[37:01] remember the scripture said uh in john 3
[37:04] that except a man be born again he
[37:06] cannot understand the kingdom of god
[37:08] that understanding deals with seeing
[37:11] it isn't that we become smarter people
[37:14] but the understanding is where there's a
[37:16] seeing there's a there's a reality that
[37:18] strikes our heart where we're more we're
[37:21] not just aware of the unseen realm we're
[37:24] tapped into the unseen realm
[37:26] and it's also by that understanding as
[37:29] jesus could say he he that heareth my
[37:32] words and understand it believeth on me
[37:36] have eternal life and brother random
[37:38] will pick it up in satan's eden and says
[37:40] now understanding he says is more than
[37:44] just hearing he said the drunkard could
[37:46] hear it and remain a drunkard the
[37:49] prostitute can hear it and remain a
[37:50] prostitute he said but understanding
[37:53] means he who heareth or understandeth it
[37:56] he said because once you've understanded
[37:59] there is a change come about within your
[38:01] life so it's not a natural change it's
[38:04] not something up here but it's an
[38:06] understanding of the living god who is
[38:09] present in our midst and that word is
[38:12] speaking to our life and it's him
[38:14] personally and that's an understanding
[38:16] that opens to you and i of the living
[38:19] god who is present right here
[38:21] and so when we look at this
[38:23] understanding i'm going to go right into
[38:25] a scripture actually brother benny used
[38:27] here
[38:28] on thursday night but i want to just i
[38:30] want to just take this here in verse 6
[38:32] of job 32 here is elihu all the rest of
[38:36] those three previous friends of job have
[38:39] come
[38:39] and they don't know how to interpret
[38:43] what's taking place
[38:45] and as a matter of fact when you read in
[38:46] the scripture you read job is standing
[38:49] on his sacrifice the message that god
[38:52] has given him he doesn't know what's
[38:54] going on but he knows because he's
[38:57] tapped in as a vindicated prophet that
[39:00] there is a channel of inspiration that i
[39:02] don't know what's taking place but when
[39:04] it's time for me to know god will make
[39:06] it known to me amen and then we find
[39:09] that with job you and i can look into
[39:11] our own lives and we can see that even
[39:14] as job himself he got just so under that
[39:17] that the the the conversations of those
[39:20] others that job actually begin to
[39:22] justify himself in their presence but
[39:26] you see when you get to looking at all
[39:28] this here comes alihou on the scene
[39:31] and elihu is a type of christ
[39:34] is that right ella who could tell job i
[39:37] am thy wish in god's dead
[39:40] i am clay as thou art clay you see it
[39:42] takes the living god to bring
[39:44] understanding and clarity you or i could
[39:47] not understand what's taking place in
[39:50] this hour or even in our own lives
[39:52] without the holy spirit coming and i'm
[39:55] telling you we don't just need one
[39:57] visitation we do to be changed from
[39:59] death unto life but we need visitation
[40:02] after visitation from the holy spirit
[40:07] glory be to god this message did not
[40:09] come by the mind of a man
[40:14] this message is that of the mighty angel
[40:17] that has come down amen
[40:21] i want to just look at this here just
[40:23] for a moment and i i'm just going to
[40:26] just just read this in verse 6 and allah
[40:30] the son of bhakkara forgive me if i
[40:32] butchered that the uh the buzaite
[40:34] answered and said i am young and you're
[40:37] very old wherefore i was afraid and
[40:40] durst not show you mine opinion
[40:44] stay with me verse seven i said days
[40:47] should speak and multitude of years
[40:49] should teach wisdom
[40:50] now here ella who has looked at things
[40:53] and he says behold but there is a spirit
[40:56] in man and the inspiration of the
[40:58] almighty giveth them
[41:01] understanding
[41:02] great men are not always wise neither do
[41:05] the aged understand judgment
[41:09] now he's just put it here very clearly
[41:12] that it's not that it's not anything
[41:15] that rests in man of how old a man is
[41:18] even though we know that even those that
[41:20] would be among us as we grow older
[41:22] there's more wisdom we have experiences
[41:24] experiences of things we could say don't
[41:26] go that way don't do that there there
[41:29] comes experiences in our life and those
[41:32] experiences come about also by honest
[41:35] reflections
[41:36] brother brandon says bill brown said it
[41:38] like this in the message he said when
[41:40] you got a man he said all he's ever
[41:42] pronouncing is the blessings of god on
[41:44] you and he doesn't speak of the cursings
[41:46] he said you better get away from that
[41:47] man
[41:48] then he goes on to tell us he said when
[41:50] you have a person he said and they know
[41:53] ev they know the answer to everything he
[41:55] also said you better get away from that
[41:57] person because there's only one one
[42:00] person among us who has the answer for
[42:03] everything and sometimes it's not the
[42:05] answer or the way that you are even
[42:08] thinking about it it's god's way because
[42:10] his way is higher than our ways
[42:13] we get in trouble when we try to make
[42:15] god's ways our ways instead of allowing
[42:17] our ways to be molded to god's ways
[42:21] true notice days i thought days should
[42:24] speak some multitude of years should
[42:26] speak great men are not always wise
[42:28] neither do the agent understand judgment
[42:31] notice where elihu is putting the focus
[42:34] that understanding it comes by
[42:37] inspiration from almighty god it is
[42:40] sovereignly given
[42:42] right
[42:43] true
[42:44] therefore i said i hearken to me
[42:47] and i also will show you my opinion
[42:50] hello who's got some opinions
[42:53] come on now
[42:54] joe what are you going to do
[42:57] i tell you what job's going to do he's
[42:59] going to recognize that these opinions
[43:01] are coming from god
[43:02] amen are you hearing me now
[43:05] you see brother branham takes it and i
[43:07] heard but now i see i i love this
[43:08] statement it's at the end of the message
[43:10] of that and brother brahms just been
[43:12] talking as you heard brother benny going
[43:13] through that here the other night and
[43:16] and this you know over weeks it just
[43:17] pondered in my heart brother branham
[43:19] begins to speak about the channel of
[43:21] inspiration that's open to you and i in
[43:24] this hour and he speaks of how here he
[43:26] is he's he's watching in the midst of of
[43:29] a congregation and he says and like this
[43:32] he says it seems like there's a channel
[43:34] kind of i spoke that's pulling me this
[43:38] way now here he is discernment is taking
[43:40] place and he's he's looking and he's
[43:42] feeling a channel pulling him a certain
[43:45] way now i want you to watch what happens
[43:47] here he says being i've directed it that
[43:50] way now it comes wonderful and then the
[43:52] vision breaks you're here with this and
[43:55] your husband is with this and this
[43:56] situation you see the channel comes open
[44:00] and the prophet feels the pool so what
[44:03] he does is he yields to that pool and
[44:06] then it becomes wonderful
[44:08] i'd say that's a pattern of what god's
[44:11] desire is and how we are to live our
[44:13] lives in that place to where when we
[44:16] feel the channel of god pulling us in a
[44:18] certain direction maybe there's
[44:20] something we need to be looking at in
[44:22] the word and we're overlooking or our
[44:25] answer is right there and here we are
[44:27] it's to be sensitive to that and just
[44:29] direct ourselves that way it'll come
[44:32] wonderfully
[44:33] amen
[44:34] it's an understanding that comes to you
[44:36] and i and this is why we we need we need
[44:39] to heed to the channel of the hour the
[44:42] pull of the hour get ready make sure the
[44:46] token is applied where christ is your
[44:49] life and your whole life is wrapped in
[44:50] him amen you understand what i'm saying
[44:53] it's more than just overcoming drinking
[44:55] overcoming smoking overcoming sick
[44:57] overcoming all you can have a whole is
[44:59] it's deeper than that it's where your
[45:02] life becomes wrapped in jesus christ
[45:06] it's inspired into him where he is your
[45:10] life as brother branham could say our
[45:12] life is so wrapped into him amen so
[45:15] let's discern let's discern the time
[45:17] we're in you know jesus spoke of the
[45:19] pharisees
[45:20] they could discern the skies
[45:23] it's going to be rain or it's going to
[45:24] be a good day or it's going to be this
[45:25] it's going to and he said you fail to
[45:27] recognize and discern the sign
[45:30] of the times it was right before them
[45:33] but they weren't discerning it did they
[45:34] know the scripture they knew the
[45:36] scripture
[45:37] but they did were not in tune with the
[45:40] inspiration of god
[45:42] you see even if they didn't see it which
[45:44] they didn't but the thing they could
[45:47] have done wasn't say i don't see it but
[45:50] i hear what's being said
[45:52] and their testimony was nicodemus let
[45:54] the cat out of the bag we know thou art
[45:56] a teacher come from god hallelujah
[46:00] we've blasted you on youtube we've done
[46:02] this we've done that but we know behind
[46:04] closed doors
[46:06] thou art a teacher come from god because
[46:09] no man can do these miracles like this
[46:14] see it was a lack of humility if they
[46:16] only in that moment could have just said
[46:18] i don't understand it i don't see it i
[46:21] know it's of god but can you help me to
[46:24] see it
[46:26] yes god would have honored that
[46:30] oh my
[46:31] may we never be too big
[46:34] to say god open my eyes amen
[46:36] lord i'm not seeing that exactly but god
[46:39] opened my eyes if if the word is coming
[46:42] forth and there's things being directed
[46:44] down if that's god is speaking lord i
[46:46] may not see it the way that you're
[46:48] bringing it but open my eyes so that i
[46:50] can see it lord the way you're bringing
[46:53] it yes amen amen we want to discern the
[46:56] hour the time we're living in we want to
[46:58] be spiritual
[46:59] we want to be spiritual spirit-filled
[47:02] setting our things on things our
[47:04] affections on things above
[47:07] now when we look at this with honest
[47:08] reflections
[47:11] honest
[47:12] is a great quality the scriptures would
[47:14] also refer to this as uprightness
[47:18] and honest reflections is
[47:21] reflection is something that we're able
[47:23] to see or to or to look at that'll like
[47:26] like a mirror a mirror will show certain
[47:28] things up
[47:30] within within a life and i want to look
[47:32] at it in that way of where we can we're
[47:34] looking at the mirror
[47:36] of god's word
[47:38] and i want to just just just to just
[47:40] looking at this a few moments because
[47:43] the word of god
[47:45] as it speaks in james 1 22 the word of
[47:48] god is a looking glass
[47:51] this word is a looking place
[47:54] it's one that you we can behold
[47:57] ourselves in
[47:59] and what it becomes then once we are
[48:02] beholding ourselves in it it now becomes
[48:05] our choice and responsibility as to what
[48:08] we do with the image that we're
[48:09] beholding
[48:11] nobody else can do it for us a pastor
[48:13] can't a prophet can't nobody not only
[48:15] well we have to take responsibility as
[48:18] we were looking at last week work out
[48:19] our own salvation with fear and
[48:21] trembling
[48:22] the distrusting of one's own of one's
[48:25] own ability but a cleaving unto him
[48:28] who is able to change us
[48:30] and bring to pass what he is calling for
[48:33] in his word
[48:34] so
[48:35] in james 1 22 let me just read this here
[48:39] be you doers of the word and not hearers
[48:42] only deceiving your own selves
[48:46] that's a pretty bold statement
[48:49] because we recognize then hearing is not
[48:52] altogether understanding
[48:56] hearing
[48:57] a person can hear it
[48:59] but what separates a hearer and a doer
[49:03] and he separates this from coming to
[49:05] pass is an unction of the spirit of god
[49:08] in a healing to that word and look when
[49:12] the word speaks to us let me tell you
[49:14] the word calls for things that are word
[49:17] and in order for the word to be
[49:19] fulfilled it requires the living word
[49:22] himself to move on the inside and it
[49:25] requires his quickening in our life and
[49:28] a continual quickening
[49:31] we are made to be dependent upon him
[49:34] amen
[49:35] we're not goats we're sheep right is
[49:37] that right and sheep we're helpless we
[49:40] need his leadership
[49:43] so when we look at this this is where we
[49:46] we have our own life evaluated in the
[49:48] light of god's word and notice for if
[49:51] any be a hearer of the word and not a
[49:53] doer he's likened to a man beholding his
[49:56] natural face in a glass
[49:58] he beholdeth himself and goeth his way
[50:01] and straightway forgetteth what manner
[50:04] of man he was now this word forget
[50:06] actually means it just
[50:08] it just just just doesn't care
[50:11] just in care now i i'm going to say this
[50:14] i don't believe that there were people
[50:16] i'm just going to maybe i'm making a
[50:17] bold statement here but i just don't
[50:19] believe that people just walk around and
[50:20] say i don't care we understand there's
[50:23] people saying i don't care they'll never
[50:25] be back
[50:26] you might witness them to them hey
[50:27] they'll cut you off right now i don't
[50:29] want to go there i don't want to see
[50:31] that
[50:32] but this is dealing with situations
[50:34] where that a person's beholding their
[50:37] life and yet not really taking inventory
[50:40] about it and putting it off to another
[50:43] time i i'll take care of that later or
[50:45] that's too big for me let me tell you
[50:47] something every promise of god is too
[50:50] big for me and you
[50:52] but it's not too big for god
[50:55] if you can just let god have his way in
[50:58] your life and submit to him there's not
[51:00] a giant two-bed
[51:02] there's not a giant that can stand on
[51:04] your mountain if you'll just get in line
[51:07] with that word and say be it unto me
[51:10] according to that word i can't i don't
[51:12] see this right now but i know that's my
[51:14] promise i'm going to stand on that
[51:16] promise with sincerity and prayer i'm
[51:19] going to dedicate it and like a child of
[51:21] abraham i'm gonna say get the diapers
[51:23] ready go buy the crib go get the
[51:25] stroller go get it cause it's mine and
[51:28] god has spoken it
[51:29] [Applause]
[51:32] hallelujah
[51:33] we're following a message in this hour
[51:36] that god has spoken who can but prophesy
[51:40] what tongue can raise its lip and raise
[51:42] against judgment or tear down the
[51:45] promises of god in this hour i tell you
[51:47] a person is fighting in the wrong
[51:49] direction
[51:50] you can't take away the promises of god
[51:53] from the church of the living god this
[51:55] is the hour that we are made to excel
[51:59] and ascend in the promises of god
[52:02] that's what i understand by the books
[52:06] praise the lord
[52:07] hallelujah
[52:09] we don't want to be forgetful we want to
[52:10] be diligent
[52:12] sometimes what we see we don't like
[52:14] right let's just be honest
[52:16] even things that i can pray about in my
[52:18] own life there's things that i behold in
[52:20] the word but what i'm saying i don't
[52:21] like
[52:22] our flesh gets pinched a little bit and
[52:24] there's things i can see in my own life
[52:26] and say oh god i don't want that there
[52:29] but don't walk away just stay right
[52:31] there in his presence
[52:37] but who so looketh into
[52:40] into the perfect law of liberty
[52:43] and continueth therein so the things
[52:46] that you see
[52:48] you're beholding yourself
[52:50] but notice the scripture said whosoever
[52:52] looketh into
[52:53] this phrase looketh into means
[52:56] one
[52:57] who stoops down
[52:59] and has to get down
[53:01] and to look in
[53:03] you know what that is humility
[53:06] amen because you see god's so big
[53:10] he can make himself so small
[53:12] we think greatness is something big out
[53:15] here but no greatness is humility
[53:18] amen and god shows us that that really
[53:21] to stoop down stoop down to look into
[53:23] that perfect law of liberty the things
[53:25] that we see and we can look as you look
[53:28] into that liberty let me tell you
[53:29] something as you look into it if you
[53:31] look into the law of liberty you will
[53:33] see your freedom you will see your
[53:36] liberty you will see the very thing
[53:38] that's tormented you and haunted you you
[53:41] will see yourself as a master over that
[53:43] thing amen
[53:45] glory be to god
[53:47] oh my and continueth therein
[53:51] he being not a forgetful hearer but a
[53:53] doer of the work this man shall be
[53:55] blessed in his deed
[53:57] amen i believe i'm speaking to doers
[53:59] this morning
[54:00] we don't want to be here as only we want
[54:02] to be doers we want us that word it
[54:04] moves within our hearts to see it
[54:06] materialized in our life
[54:09] brother brown would say it like this
[54:11] and just referring to this and i i have
[54:14] this down but maybe i'll just refer to
[54:16] it without reading at the same time he
[54:18] talked about in his own
[54:20] home in kentucky they had a piece
[54:24] of a mirror now he deals with this in
[54:26] the message identification shalom on and
[54:28] on throughout and he they had a piece of
[54:31] a looking glass didn't have one in their
[54:33] house
[54:35] they had it there tacked to the tree and
[54:37] you know dad would shave at it and his
[54:39] mom would comb his hair he said it was
[54:40] just a piece of a looking glass
[54:43] then he talked about how there was a
[54:44] little boy down in that same area that
[54:47] he never seen a mirror in his life
[54:50] he went to one of the relatives homes
[54:51] and he was playing a little bit and
[54:53] finally the door closed and on the back
[54:56] of that door was a mirror
[54:58] and so what he began to do was he was
[54:59] going to walk because he commanders and
[55:01] a little boy i don't have to be bored
[55:03] there's another little fella just like
[55:04] me you know there's another little guy
[55:06] he began to walk and when he got up to
[55:08] it he realized and he turns around mama
[55:13] this is me hallelujah
[55:16] he saw himself in the mirror
[55:19] let me just say this to you in this hour
[55:22] that's exactly where the church of the
[55:24] living god was at
[55:25] we only had a piece of a mirror
[55:29] are you hearing me now
[55:31] we only had a piece of a mirror but god
[55:33] has delivered a full reflection a full
[55:37] mere full glory to light
[55:41] according to his promise in this hour
[55:45] when you hear the revealing of the son
[55:47] of man that's dealing with the fullness
[55:49] of god himself the fullness of the holy
[55:52] ghost coming that's what it was in jesus
[55:55] christ
[55:56] is that right
[55:57] god upon earth in his body
[56:00] right that's how it was on the day of
[56:02] pentecost
[56:04] but god promised i will restore is that
[56:08] right
[56:09] they they fell from that they got away
[56:11] from that they got away from
[56:13] steadfastness and things crept in but
[56:15] god promised that in the days in the
[56:18] days of the son of man as it was in the
[56:20] days of noah as he was in the days of
[56:22] life so shall it be in the coming of the
[56:24] son of man let me just say that same
[56:27] ministry of the son of man is right here
[56:30] now
[56:30] amen because the ministry of the son of
[56:33] man is the angel of the lord that is
[56:36] right here now the same one that came
[56:38] before abraham and sarah's tenth are you
[56:41] with me now he said i will return to you
[56:45] according to the time of life
[56:48] oh my it wasn't it wasn't the same body
[56:50] that he used but god was announcing i'm
[56:54] coming into my body he was calling his
[56:57] body into a place of full deliverance
[57:00] and yielding to his presence that's why
[57:02] the prophet could address us and say i
[57:05] charge you to believe that the son of
[57:07] man is manifest in the bride's
[57:11] the body of man is the fullness of jesus
[57:14] christ not just a portion
[57:16] not just a piece of a mirror
[57:18] we don't have a piece of a mirror just
[57:20] to see ourselves justified we don't have
[57:22] just a little bit more of a piece of a
[57:24] mirror to see ourselves sanctified we
[57:26] don't have just another piece to see the
[57:28] restoration of the gifts and
[57:30] supernatural among us but now there is a
[57:32] fullness of the mirror in other words
[57:35] the seals are taken off and the mirror
[57:38] is fully in view
[57:41] i understand by the books
[57:46] amen hallelujah because this is a time
[57:49] of understanding
[57:50] oh my and that's why
[57:52] we want to look as brother brown would
[57:54] say it like this we want to look
[57:57] into god's great mirror of his word
[57:58] don't get nervous
[58:00] i want to look into god's great mirror
[58:01] of his word i want to read this part
[58:03] it's paragraph 39
[58:05] he said i want to look at me and i want
[58:07] you to look at yourself
[58:08] as we look into god's great mirror of
[58:10] his word
[58:11] let's be able to identify ourselves with
[58:13] some we're going to speak about
[58:14] some of the characters of other times
[58:16] and i want to see myself in god's
[58:18] looking glass because if there's
[58:19] anything we'll show you where you're
[58:21] standing it's this book
[58:23] there's no book like it because it's all
[58:24] truth i don't say that other books are
[58:26] not true but i know this one is true
[58:28] it's all truth because it's the word of
[58:29] god
[58:30] he said jesus gave us the example of
[58:32] what we ought to be looking at when he
[58:34] reflected his life to us through the
[58:36] word what we should see
[58:39] when we look into god's mirror we should
[58:41] see ourselves identified with him that
[58:45] is a perfect example so when i look at
[58:47] myself in the word i ought to be able to
[58:49] see myself as a son and daughter of god
[58:52] and if there's anything that that that
[58:54] limits that then i then i know that what
[58:57] i'm looking into if i just humble myself
[59:01] whatever that i have need of if if i
[59:03] have need of the holy ghost i'm not
[59:05] going to get it looking somewhere else
[59:07] it's only going to be the word that's
[59:08] going to show it up the word is going to
[59:10] say you're missing this or you're
[59:11] missing that but if the word is not to
[59:13] pick us apart the word is to show us
[59:16] where we're lacking why because it's
[59:18] time to get out of here
[59:20] i understand by the books
[59:24] it's time to leave
[59:27] amen god god made a preparation man
[59:30] didn't do this man didn't take the seals
[59:32] there were many good men in heaven
[59:35] he said i looked in heaven
[59:37] there was elijah there was elisha there
[59:39] were jeremiah all of them but not one of
[59:42] them could come and take them up amen it
[59:46] had to be one who was sinless nature
[59:50] amen come down and take that book for
[59:52] you and i
[59:53] he prevailed he took that book in the
[59:56] garden of gethsemane
[59:58] he took what was lost the right to the
[1:00:00] tree of life the right to eternal life
[1:00:03] he took back what rightfully belonged to
[1:00:05] you and i and then that same life could
[1:00:08] come to us as a believer and this book
[1:00:11] has been in the hands of god the whole
[1:00:14] time and the lamb comes forward to do
[1:00:17] what take the title deed to redemption
[1:00:20] and he's announcing this is the hour
[1:00:24] this is the time
[1:00:26] of rapture
[1:00:28] i understand by the books
[1:00:34] now in daniel chapter nine
[1:00:39] daniel said in verse two if you don't
[1:00:40] mind me reading it again i understood by
[1:00:42] the books the number of the years
[1:00:44] where the word of the lord came to
[1:00:45] jeremiah the prophet that he would
[1:00:46] accomplish 70 years
[1:00:48] in the desolations of jerusalem
[1:00:51] i want you to notice what spiritual
[1:00:53] understanding what it did for daniel
[1:00:56] and i set my face
[1:00:58] unto the lord god
[1:01:00] to seek by prayer
[1:01:02] and supplications
[1:01:04] with fasting
[1:01:06] and sackcloth and ashes
[1:01:08] and i prayed unto the lord my god and
[1:01:11] made confession
[1:01:13] and said o lord the great and dreadful
[1:01:15] god keeping the covenant and mercy to
[1:01:18] them that love him and to them that keep
[1:01:21] his commandments
[1:01:23] see this was the time
[1:01:25] it drew near this was at the part of
[1:01:28] brother branham would say it like this
[1:01:29] it was at the time of the 68th year
[1:01:32] and daniel notice when daniel himself
[1:01:36] i want you to take this in mind
[1:01:38] daniel without the blood
[1:01:41] without the baptism of the holy ghost he
[1:01:43] lived a victorious life
[1:01:46] you hear me
[1:01:47] now that's not a type for you and i to
[1:01:49] say without the blood and without the
[1:01:50] holy ghost you can live a victorious
[1:01:52] life he was living according to what god
[1:01:56] had revealed to him at the time when i'm
[1:01:58] talking about the blood i'm talking
[1:01:59] about the blood of the lord jesus
[1:02:01] just exactly how the prophet put it
[1:02:02] there but he was living victorious you
[1:02:05] know what that tells me it tells me that
[1:02:07] no matter where
[1:02:09] that a child of god would happen to be
[1:02:11] now i don't believe in putting ourselves
[1:02:12] in places we ought not be
[1:02:14] amen come on now oh brother samuel i'm a
[1:02:16] believer i'll tell you i can just go
[1:02:18] anywhere no no no daniel didn't put
[1:02:20] himself there
[1:02:22] come on now daniel didn't just say you
[1:02:24] know what i'm going to do this right now
[1:02:25] i'm going to be a light here daniel
[1:02:27] didn't decide where he was going to be a
[1:02:28] light amen he was a light and god
[1:02:31] decided this is where i'm going to put
[1:02:32] you
[1:02:35] you see when we try to do things don't
[1:02:36] we might be a light of god but we
[1:02:38] actually are hindrance when we're not
[1:02:40] moving under his leadership but when we
[1:02:43] move under the leadership of almighty
[1:02:45] god you know what that shows when you're
[1:02:47] in the will of god that there is nothing
[1:02:49] of satan that can overthrow or prevent
[1:02:53] the work of god you're in the keeping
[1:02:55] power of almighty god
[1:02:58] oh my no wonder we should strive to stay
[1:03:01] in the will of god that's why i don't go
[1:03:03] to places that jesus can't go
[1:03:06] don't watch things that jesus can't
[1:03:08] watch
[1:03:09] come on friends if you jesus can't be
[1:03:12] your buddy and do it then you don't need
[1:03:14] to be doing it
[1:03:18] and again there's something that's in
[1:03:19] you within that you need to ask god to
[1:03:21] remedy that within your life
[1:03:24] if it's a habit if it's something that
[1:03:26] you can set in shame god don't want you
[1:03:28] to sit in shame he's here to bring
[1:03:30] deliverance to your life it's time to
[1:03:33] understand this is the hour of
[1:03:36] deliverance not just the change of the
[1:03:38] body it's a time for deliverance the
[1:03:41] lamb has tried it over every devil every
[1:03:45] demon every sickness
[1:03:48] amen he's bigger than your situation
[1:03:50] he's greater than your problem the lamb
[1:03:53] this greater worthy is the lamb that was
[1:03:57] to receive rich's glory power and honor
[1:04:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:04:05] daniel notice
[1:04:07] when this understanding came
[1:04:09] he went to
[1:04:10] prayer right
[1:04:13] i said he went to prayer amen
[1:04:17] brother brown words it like this
[1:04:19] he says
[1:04:21] how daniel was able to see
[1:04:24] we're near the time
[1:04:26] of deliverance
[1:04:28] daniel's looking into the word
[1:04:31] and he said what it is
[1:04:33] he said daniel
[1:04:34] he set aside all his work
[1:04:37] he pulled down as it was the shades of
[1:04:40] all his daily tasks
[1:04:43] he set his face to god
[1:04:46] put on sackcloth and ashes and went to
[1:04:48] fasting and praying that he might
[1:04:50] understand when that time would
[1:04:52] be because it was so important to him
[1:04:56] you see whatever is important to you or
[1:04:58] me will come out that's true
[1:05:00] amen
[1:05:02] you understand
[1:05:03] whatever is important will come out in
[1:05:05] our life
[1:05:06] it's one thing we can say this friends
[1:05:08] i'm talking about honest reflections we
[1:05:10] can say that god is first in our life
[1:05:12] but what comes out of our life tells
[1:05:15] what place he is
[1:05:18] and if we're honest about it he'll help
[1:05:20] us amen honest reflections releases the
[1:05:24] purity and the cleansing power of the
[1:05:27] washing of water by the word amen
[1:05:31] you see when isaiah got in the temple
[1:05:34] isaiah walked in there like any other
[1:05:36] time
[1:05:36] but when he went in there after
[1:05:39] the arm of flesh he was leaning on
[1:05:43] uzziah
[1:05:44] you see the arm of flesh is deceitful
[1:05:48] the arm of flesh is not your joy
[1:05:51] the arm of flesh is not to be your
[1:05:52] comfort oh i tell you we're in just such
[1:05:54] a a terrible time oh i need to find
[1:05:57] something to settle or something the arm
[1:05:59] of flesh is not that right the arm of
[1:06:02] flesh will take you away
[1:06:05] isaiah walks into the temple of god the
[1:06:07] arm of flesh is gone
[1:06:10] but when he walks in that day
[1:06:12] there's a meeting that god's arranged
[1:06:14] with him
[1:06:16] and the post of the temple were moved
[1:06:19] amen and there was an honest reflection
[1:06:21] that began to come the presence of god
[1:06:23] moving down in the temple isaiah looked
[1:06:26] there and he says woe is me
[1:06:29] i'm a man of unclean lips see what was
[1:06:32] happening is the presence of god was
[1:06:35] bringing a true reflection amen it
[1:06:38] didn't matter that isaiah was a prophet
[1:06:41] it didn't matter god's presence reveals
[1:06:44] truth amen
[1:06:46] the bible said you shall know the truth
[1:06:48] and the truth shall make you free
[1:06:52] satan wants to hold back from truth i'm
[1:06:55] not just talking about mysteries i'm
[1:06:56] talking about truth of who you really
[1:06:58] are brother brown tells us in deity of
[1:07:01] jesus christ he said satan wants you to
[1:07:03] think you're some trotting down
[1:07:05] something he said but you're not you're
[1:07:07] sons and daughters of god somebody has
[1:07:10] to let you know who you are and know
[1:07:13] what your rights are so you can go and
[1:07:16] claim your rights with a humble heart
[1:07:18] [Music]
[1:07:20] woe is me i'm a man of unclean lips
[1:07:23] honest reflection
[1:07:27] and when that happened
[1:07:29] there was a confession
[1:07:31] then came the cleansing then came the
[1:07:34] fire the cold the live coal the live
[1:07:36] coal it wasn't an old an old coal that
[1:07:38] you know was just charred up and and
[1:07:40] want no life in it
[1:07:42] it was a living word
[1:07:45] that came forth what was it what brought
[1:07:47] that what was me i'm a man of unclean
[1:07:50] lips it was his confession that invited
[1:07:53] the cleansing
[1:07:54] cleansing always follows confession it
[1:07:57] doesn't work prior to that's right
[1:08:00] that's why the holy ghost could fall and
[1:08:02] a person can experience the holy ghost
[1:08:03] falling on them and yet they've not
[1:08:05] repented
[1:08:06] but yet they can hang upon that right
[1:08:08] there and knowing that there's things
[1:08:10] within their life that are not right
[1:08:11] that need to be fully cleaned out it can
[1:08:14] never produce a real birth
[1:08:18] are you with me i just just heard it the
[1:08:19] other day brother sent it here on
[1:08:22] on on a chat the other day you know a
[1:08:24] group of ministers i'm with and how that
[1:08:26] here brother brad was speaking to a man
[1:08:28] and here he was he begins to go in the
[1:08:29] man's death and then god moves down on
[1:08:31] the scene and he heals the man i want
[1:08:33] you to watch sovereign grace you know
[1:08:35] sovereign grace moves down and that man
[1:08:37] is has a hearing problem and god moves
[1:08:40] down and brings deliverance to that man
[1:08:42] in his hearing and then that man's able
[1:08:45] to repeat everything i mean his speech
[1:08:47] was perfect going right out brother told
[1:08:49] him to say this say this say this it was
[1:08:50] perfect going out then that spirit of
[1:08:53] the lord speaks to that man and said
[1:08:54] just a minute sir he said there's a
[1:08:56] habit you've got in your life that's not
[1:08:58] right he said were you willing to throw
[1:09:00] those from the smoking of cigarettes
[1:09:01] down he said god will bring complete
[1:09:03] deliverance to your life you see what it
[1:09:05] was his hearing had to be opened and god
[1:09:09] was gonna deal with his life he didn't
[1:09:11] want that man walking around thinking
[1:09:13] everything was all right just because he
[1:09:15] had been hearing but there's got to be a
[1:09:18] union with almighty god
[1:09:20] he measures more than just than a
[1:09:22] deliverance from sin it's to be united
[1:09:25] with him he delivered you so he could
[1:09:28] unite himself with you
[1:09:31] amen condom wonder mistaken in this hour
[1:09:34] this is what i'm talking about this is
[1:09:36] where the full mirror is in view
[1:09:42] he set aside he pulled down as it was
[1:09:44] the shades of his daily tasks
[1:09:47] words if we can break this down
[1:09:50] daniel
[1:09:52] evaluated things in his life
[1:09:54] that could be cut
[1:09:56] all right
[1:09:57] that's not necessary all right
[1:10:00] that right there is not necessary what
[1:10:01] did that understanding amen
[1:10:04] understanding by the books
[1:10:07] revelation doesn't make us more loose
[1:10:10] that's right right
[1:10:12] well by the same i've seen something
[1:10:13] that somebody's not your focus
[1:10:16] i know i'm speaking pretty plain but
[1:10:18] jesus christ is your focus
[1:10:20] don't you live your life and order your
[1:10:22] family based on somebody else you order
[1:10:25] your life by the word of god amen you
[1:10:28] have to have an absolute you have to
[1:10:30] have thus saith the lord not going along
[1:10:32] because well so-and-so did this so and
[1:10:34] so did that they are not your mirror
[1:10:38] your mirror is the living word of god
[1:10:41] that you get before you prostrate your
[1:10:44] fourth self before how do i do that you
[1:10:46] understand by the book this is the hour
[1:10:50] to be sure yes lord
[1:10:52] this is the hour
[1:10:54] see daniel brother baby says it like
[1:10:56] this in another place he says i think
[1:10:59] daniel
[1:11:00] i think daniel was reading the prophets
[1:11:02] before him i don't have this up there
[1:11:03] this is just what i have in i think
[1:11:05] daniel was reading the prophets before
[1:11:07] him and he had this kind of an
[1:11:08] understanding that he was near the end
[1:11:10] and he sought god to find out how close
[1:11:12] the end was
[1:11:14] he said then i think we're justified
[1:11:17] by seeing that we're at the end of the
[1:11:19] road now
[1:11:20] put on not sackcloth and ashes
[1:11:23] but throw off the things of the world
[1:11:26] and our cares of this life and seek god
[1:11:31] to find out what day of the year we're
[1:11:33] in because we see we're at the end and
[1:11:36] so the church will fast and pray and be
[1:11:38] ready brother braham goes into that same
[1:11:41] quote and he says you remember he said
[1:11:42] in years past i would just touch them 70
[1:11:44] weeks and went right on by him he said
[1:11:45] because i didn't understand it
[1:11:48] he said but now
[1:11:50] is the time
[1:11:51] amen
[1:11:52] remember he told us that is a key
[1:11:54] juncture that message 70 weeks of daniel
[1:11:56] is a key juncture there with from the
[1:11:59] from the church ages and from the seals
[1:12:01] and breach and brother ram even goes
[1:12:02] into that on the seals again
[1:12:04] so i want to just say it in this way we
[1:12:06] we know that has to be a humility
[1:12:09] that our lives god requires humility is
[1:12:11] that right
[1:12:12] amen god will always humility and
[1:12:14] humility is as the scripture could say
[1:12:16] whoever exalts himself matthew 23 12
[1:12:19] shall be a base and he that shall humble
[1:12:21] himself shall be exalted likewise ye
[1:12:23] younger submit yourselves unto the elder
[1:12:25] yea all of you be subject one to another
[1:12:28] and be clothed with humility
[1:12:30] for god resisteth the proud and giveth
[1:12:32] grace to the humble humble yourselves
[1:12:34] therefore unto the mighty hand of god
[1:12:35] that he may exalt you
[1:12:37] in due time
[1:12:38] casting all your care upon him for he
[1:12:41] careth
[1:12:42] for you
[1:12:44] now you know daniel goes through here
[1:12:46] and i'm not going to read all these
[1:12:48] verses i have them down but i just want
[1:12:50] to get to this point
[1:12:51] in daniel 9 9
[1:12:54] daniel's praying this whole time
[1:12:57] he began to pray and make confessions
[1:13:00] daniel when you read this here in the
[1:13:02] scripture daniel is not looking at it in
[1:13:04] a manner of saying
[1:13:06] lord your people did evil your people
[1:13:08] but daniel said we lord
[1:13:11] us lord
[1:13:12] we lord
[1:13:13] same way in ezra chapter nine when ezra
[1:13:15] prays for intercessor
[1:13:17] he puts himself
[1:13:19] beneath the word
[1:13:21] not above the word
[1:13:22] ah no no no we have
[1:13:28] so in humility to the word because he's
[1:13:30] recognizing where we're at
[1:13:32] there's one way there's one way god has
[1:13:35] made a way out of this but the 70 years
[1:13:37] god just wasn't going to come down and
[1:13:38] get him by the hand and just pull him
[1:13:40] out
[1:13:41] the exodus out of there in 70 years was
[1:13:44] going to be a fulfillment of jeremiah 29
[1:13:47] when you begin to seek me with all your
[1:13:50] heart
[1:13:51] amen then i'll be found of you
[1:13:54] there was a lot of stuff that it got
[1:13:56] between israel and god
[1:13:58] all right
[1:14:01] and god was sending his word to him but
[1:14:03] they weren't heeding it
[1:14:05] they heard it
[1:14:07] daniel goes through all of this but i
[1:14:08] want to just drop into these couple
[1:14:10] verses and just tie it up right here
[1:14:13] he says in verse 9
[1:14:15] to the lord our god belong mercies and
[1:14:17] forgiveness that's true in it amen where
[1:14:19] would we be without the mercies and
[1:14:21] forgiveness of god that belongs to god
[1:14:24] though we have rebelled against him
[1:14:26] neither have we obeyed the voice of the
[1:14:28] lord our god to walk in his laws
[1:14:32] which he
[1:14:33] set before us
[1:14:35] by his servants the prophets
[1:14:38] you know there was confusion that came
[1:14:39] up in the church in galatia
[1:14:42] you had those that wanted to take the
[1:14:44] focus in galatia judaizers false
[1:14:47] brethren that came in there and one of
[1:14:49] them to start keeping feasts and
[1:14:51] festivals and everything else again and
[1:14:53] putting the people's faith on that
[1:14:56] and taking it away
[1:14:58] from the lord jesus christ
[1:15:02] that the miracles were not done by the
[1:15:03] law the miracles were done by the spirit
[1:15:06] of god the hearing of faith
[1:15:09] and paul could let him know jesus christ
[1:15:11] has been evidently set before your eyes
[1:15:15] in other words the gospel that i've
[1:15:18] preached it's not been word only but
[1:15:20] have been in power and demonstration
[1:15:24] the same god who sent me and ordained me
[1:15:27] from my mother's womb and called me to
[1:15:29] be a prophet i've yielded to his voice
[1:15:32] i've met him face to face and that same
[1:15:35] god has stood right there and reflected
[1:15:37] himself through the message that he gave
[1:15:40] me it's not my life this is his life i
[1:15:43] am only his
[1:15:51] they didn't ambassador
[1:15:53] israel come into this situation because
[1:15:55] they didn't obey the voice of the lord
[1:15:58] god sent him prophet after prophet you
[1:16:00] see what a prophet was a prophet is the
[1:16:02] mercy of god
[1:16:03] but also within when remember when mercy
[1:16:06] is rejected
[1:16:07] judgment comes
[1:16:09] it just depends on what happens
[1:16:11] see it was god's mercy the people's eyes
[1:16:14] would get clouded over they were looking
[1:16:16] at the law they were still going up and
[1:16:18] keeping the festivals isaiah once said
[1:16:21] god told them said your feasts your
[1:16:24] feasts have become a stink in my
[1:16:26] nostrils they were still doing orders
[1:16:28] but what it is they were failing to have
[1:16:31] a real examination in the word of god
[1:16:35] they were doing it out of tradition
[1:16:38] instead of being moved by inspiration
[1:16:41] amen
[1:16:43] brother say what should they have done
[1:16:44] i'll tell you what they should have done
[1:16:46] if they felt themselves getting stale
[1:16:47] when israel felt themselves getting
[1:16:49] stale felt themselves getting cold and
[1:16:51] god would send a prophet to reflect his
[1:16:54] presence down in their life and show up
[1:16:56] where is wrong the greatest thing they
[1:16:58] could do is say god forgive me for my
[1:17:00] sluffleness god forgive me for my
[1:17:02] stillness lord rekindle the fire in my
[1:17:05] life lord i've let things become too
[1:17:08] common and let things creep in lord i
[1:17:11] want you to recognize the word that
[1:17:13] you've given to me in that festival amen
[1:17:17] now look at it and say what's that
[1:17:21] amen
[1:17:24] he set before us
[1:17:26] by his servants the
[1:17:28] prophets now profit
[1:17:31] you just tie it with this
[1:17:34] a prophet is god's reflector
[1:17:38] prophets are reflectors
[1:17:43] there's things that they are they that
[1:17:45] god takes a prophet they are not made a
[1:17:48] prophet
[1:17:49] they're born a prophet
[1:17:51] right
[1:17:52] i'm going to say some things very
[1:17:53] straight here amen god's prophets are
[1:17:56] reflectors
[1:17:59] the reflector doesn't reflect itself
[1:18:01] it's out of god's only provided place of
[1:18:03] worship the reflector
[1:18:05] isn't the reflection right
[1:18:09] there has to be something strike the
[1:18:10] reflector to make it reflect so a
[1:18:12] prophet is a chosen vessel of god that
[1:18:16] cannot reflect nothing at all but he's
[1:18:18] in direct line with that reflection god
[1:18:22] to reflect the image of christ the word
[1:18:25] nothing else can do it
[1:18:27] now notice how he ties it together
[1:18:30] you are a reflector
[1:18:32] that's the reason the prophet had to eat
[1:18:34] the book that's the reason he had to eat
[1:18:36] the scroll he had to reflect the word
[1:18:39] for that age then he said enoch that was
[1:18:42] god's perfect reflector and type
[1:18:44] everything that god
[1:18:46] told enoch to do he did it
[1:18:49] he was a perfect reflector
[1:18:51] there can be things lacking in enoch's
[1:18:53] life but remember the very word enoch
[1:18:56] hebrews 11 was 11 4 11 5. enoch had a
[1:18:59] testimony the word enoch means dedicated
[1:19:03] dedicated had a testimony
[1:19:06] that's raptured dedicated
[1:19:09] dedicated to the word dedicated it's not
[1:19:12] just my efforts it's not my strength but
[1:19:15] god has brought me into the dedication
[1:19:17] by the fire of god
[1:19:19] and that fire has lit our life we are
[1:19:22] dedicated by the fire in the fire
[1:19:24] through the fire
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:27] it's a separate thought
[1:19:29] we are dedicated amen
[1:19:32] it's eating the book remember
[1:19:35] revelations 10 8
[1:19:37] through 11.
[1:19:39] right
[1:19:40] wouldn't there not have been there would
[1:19:41] not have been revelations 10 8 through
[1:19:43] 11 if there hadn't been in revelations 1
[1:19:45] through 6.
[1:19:46] and you don't get from 6 to 8 without
[1:19:49] seven
[1:19:52] you can't skip around seven and say well
[1:19:53] i'm gonna get to eight and take the book
[1:19:55] can't work that way
[1:19:56] god has sent his word through his
[1:19:58] prophet his prophet the angel of the
[1:20:00] lord has come and there was a seventh
[1:20:03] angel on earth that was a reflector one
[1:20:06] who was set aside yielded to god that
[1:20:09] the image of christ not a piece of a
[1:20:11] mirror but the fullness of god could be
[1:20:14] reflected into the church of the living
[1:20:17] god that there might come a true
[1:20:19] examination for rapture amen
[1:20:24] the bride have made herself ready
[1:20:26] then she's got to look back there when
[1:20:28] they you know we've had weddings and
[1:20:29] things like that i mean those of you
[1:20:31] been married and thing you know even as
[1:20:33] you get mad you know you go in well you
[1:20:34] know you know anybody goes into the the
[1:20:36] bridal area where they're getting ready
[1:20:38] i mean they got
[1:20:39] oh well i mean there's mirrors
[1:20:41] everywhere they're looking everywhere
[1:20:42] you know everything near why the bride
[1:20:44] is looking in the mirror
[1:20:48] a lot of times the guys don't care
[1:20:49] they're happy they got their tie on

[1:20:52] man everything's good to go they're just
[1:20:54] you know whoa i can't wait man i can't
[1:20:56] and this and hear the bride she's in
[1:20:58] there checking everything over before
[1:20:59] she comes out of that room there's
[1:21:01] mirrors that's given to her i'm telling
[1:21:04] you that god in this hour he did not
[1:21:06] leave it up to a man or ecclesiastical
[1:21:09] system but god will feel his word and
[1:21:12] reflected his presence in this power
[1:21:15] that you and i can look into the mirror
[1:21:18] of god's word where the seals have come
[1:21:20] off and we're able to take an account
[1:21:23] amen
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:25] i understand by the books i understand
[1:21:28] by the mirror
[1:21:30] where i'm at
[1:21:40] let me just say this
[1:21:43] you can have a mirror
[1:21:47] we've got mirrors in this church
[1:21:50] you got mirrors in your house
[1:21:52] but if you don't got no light
[1:21:54] that mirror ain't too good that's right
[1:21:57] i've walked back through that hallway
[1:21:59] closing out of an evening
[1:22:02] it's dark early
[1:22:04] or walked in early in the morning and
[1:22:06] that mirror is straight back there
[1:22:09] i can't see too much but i can see
[1:22:10] myself brother joy a little bit i kind
[1:22:12] of see an outline
[1:22:14] because if there's just at least a
[1:22:15] little bit of light
[1:22:17] that mirror will catch it is that right
[1:22:19] those you have it sometimes it helps you
[1:22:20] walk around your bathroom at night it'll
[1:22:22] kind of catch off of that mirror
[1:22:24] oh how much difference it is
[1:22:26] you got the mirror but when you can
[1:22:28] bring on full light
[1:22:30] when you bring on full light then that
[1:22:32] mirror what does it do it reflects the
[1:22:35] intensity and the degree of light in
[1:22:38] that hour it reflects so that you're
[1:22:40] able to see certain details
[1:22:42] i know i could go back to that mirror
[1:22:44] when i would walk in early in the
[1:22:45] morning or when i'm leaving at night and
[1:22:47] all these lights are off and i got to
[1:22:48] come out here i know i could walk out
[1:22:50] there brother carlos and say oh i need
[1:22:51] to zip this up here but if you had asked
[1:22:54] me to put a contact in
[1:22:56] no way buddy there ain't enough light
[1:22:58] there for me to see that you see god
[1:23:00] knew what we would need in this hour it
[1:23:02] would take not just a partial life not
[1:23:05] just a little bite the member of the
[1:23:07] bible said we've had enough light to see
[1:23:09] where people could join a church people
[1:23:11] could build hospitals people could do
[1:23:13] this but we're promised in this hour
[1:23:15] that when this day nor not but i will
[1:23:18] send light in the evening time
[1:23:21] amen i will send light for you that you
[1:23:24] can rise and shine and become a
[1:23:27] reflector amen
[1:23:28] hallelujah so i'm not reflecting my own
[1:23:31] life my life has come and my light came
[1:23:34] according to the promised word of this
[1:23:37] hour
[1:23:39] amen hallelujah glory
[1:23:42] glory be to god in the highest amendment
[1:23:45] it takes that of the light upon the
[1:23:47] mirror
[1:23:48] remember they've had the bible
[1:23:50] many people you could talk to they had
[1:23:52] the bible but without the light shining
[1:23:54] upon the mirror
[1:23:56] remember they can talk about it but
[1:23:59] brother brown tells us unveiling of god
[1:24:00] he said but it's no longer letter to us
[1:24:04] he said it's become light amen
[1:24:07] amen and amen made light it's your kind
[1:24:09] of light
[1:24:10] it's your kind of like the power packs
[1:24:11] within a transforming power it packs
[1:24:14] within it oh my you know hear the light
[1:24:16] of a candle stick he can come in because
[1:24:18] the the spirit of the lord searches the
[1:24:20] inward parts remember he can come in and
[1:24:22] bring conviction but what it'll point us
[1:24:23] to it points us to the source of light
[1:24:25] and that's the shekinah light amen oh
[1:24:28] lord have mercy hallelujah
[1:24:30] y'all okay amen
[1:24:33] praise the lord
[1:24:37] a reflector
[1:24:40] paul let it be known in second
[1:24:41] corinthians four
[1:24:43] this is not my light
[1:24:45] god has shined in our hearts amen the
[1:24:47] same god who shined by his word let
[1:24:49] there be light in the beginning that
[1:24:50] same god has shined his light into our
[1:24:52] life what was that light it's the word
[1:24:54] amen it's god it's his life and paul was
[1:24:57] saying
[1:24:58] it's not about us it's not us we're not
[1:25:00] preaching ourselves
[1:25:02] all right
[1:25:03] you know paul's saying i'm telling you
[1:25:05] my opinions what i'm telling you is what
[1:25:07] i've received from god
[1:25:11] are you hearing me now amen oh my you
[1:25:14] see we preach not ourselves we have this
[1:25:17] treasure this light this word this
[1:25:19] reflection in earthen vessels amen that
[1:25:23] the power of god may not
[1:25:25] may not be of us but it's of god
[1:25:27] brother brown would say in letting off
[1:25:29] the pressure he says i'm only trying to
[1:25:30] represent him reflect him like in a
[1:25:32] mirror to you
[1:25:34] making my life his mirror that he might
[1:25:37] reflect
[1:25:38] himself amen see god brings that
[1:25:42] of a prophet on the scene
[1:25:45] israel
[1:25:46] they get away from the word
[1:25:49] brother brown will tell us
[1:25:50] testimony but true witness
[1:25:52] voice of the sign
[1:25:54] and he'd let us know
[1:25:57] that what israel he said israel was
[1:25:58] still
[1:25:59] carrying around the law
[1:26:01] but they didn't have the word of the
[1:26:03] lord
[1:26:04] you see it's one thing to have the bible
[1:26:06] but it's another thing to have the word
[1:26:08] of the lord that's right
[1:26:11] is that right amen the word of the lord
[1:26:13] let me just say this the word of the
[1:26:15] lord is just more than books and tapes
[1:26:17] amen
[1:26:18] because brother adam lets us know very
[1:26:20] clearly
[1:26:22] he takes us into what the true evidence
[1:26:23] is of the holy ghost is those who could
[1:26:26] hear
[1:26:27] and not only would hear
[1:26:29] but would he to what that messenger is
[1:26:30] saying
[1:26:31] because in the holy ghost the bible said
[1:26:33] when he is come
[1:26:35] this is what he'll do he'll lead and
[1:26:37] guide you into all truth
[1:26:39] he opens our understanding it's him that
[1:26:42] makes known just like in a service like
[1:26:44] this today it becomes it's between him
[1:26:47] and you speaking lift to ear and you're
[1:26:49] looking in the mirror and you're looking
[1:26:51] around anybody else see this about me no
[1:26:53] it ain't for anybody else it's for you
[1:26:55] and god and as you'll see yourself in
[1:26:57] the mirror then what do i do just stoop
[1:26:59] down and say lord jesus lord
[1:27:02] help me lord god let that be in my life
[1:27:04] what do you do humble yourself look into
[1:27:08] the perfect law of liberty and continue
[1:27:10] therein amen and watch it'll change you
[1:27:13] amen because before change can take
[1:27:16] place there's got to be change inside of
[1:27:17] here
[1:27:18] when there's a desire and a longing for
[1:27:20] change inside of here you didn't put
[1:27:22] that there god put that there and what
[1:27:24] it is it's aligning with the word it's
[1:27:26] saying amen to the word even as the word
[1:27:29] is coming forth and you begin to agree
[1:27:31] with the word what do you find you'll
[1:27:32] find yourself in the presence of god
[1:27:35] you'll find that same pillar of fire
[1:27:37] you'll come right to where you're at
[1:27:40] and you'll be changed from glory unto
[1:27:42] glory
[1:27:46] you see a prophet
[1:27:48] the brown calls him a reflector
[1:27:51] brother brown tells it in this way
[1:27:54] he said but some hear this message
[1:27:57] and they put a carnal interpretation to
[1:28:00] it
[1:28:01] and it go off into sin now remember
[1:28:04] demas didn't go back out to nightclubs
[1:28:09] come on now amen brother brandon brings
[1:28:11] it on down and said demas was a
[1:28:12] spirit-filled man but spirit-filled
[1:28:14] where
[1:28:15] not in his soul
[1:28:17] he had it on his spirit
[1:28:19] come on now so he had under his shared
[1:28:22] understanding
[1:28:23] is that right
[1:28:25] judas shared understanding but we're
[1:28:26] talking about an understanding of life
[1:28:28] amen we're talking about an
[1:28:30] understanding of his presence and
[1:28:31] understanding that there is a complete
[1:28:34] transformation in this life that it's
[1:28:36] not i who live that's what i understand
[1:28:38] but it's christ who lives in me oh can
[1:28:40] you put this together put that together
[1:28:41] put this no but i know him who is the
[1:28:44] feast amen i know him where all that he
[1:28:46] just come out of
[1:28:48] can you just tell what i'm saying look
[1:28:50] let me tell you something everything
[1:28:51] that my wife is or or that i am to her
[1:28:54] when we're united all she is i'm a
[1:28:56] partaker of that
[1:28:58] she's a partaker of with me
[1:29:00] are you hearing me
[1:29:02] that's why when being united with jesus
[1:29:04] christ when you've been united with him
[1:29:06] he is the teacher he is the spirit of
[1:29:08] truth he will lead and guide you into
[1:29:11] all truth amen
[1:29:13] glory be to god
[1:29:15] this is what a prophet
[1:29:17] as the prophet comes to do brother
[1:29:18] braham said they who hear and he to that
[1:29:20] prophet will be blessed amen
[1:29:22] because brother branham puts it and i
[1:29:24] think about this i'm closing
[1:29:27] but i want to just i stopped there on
[1:29:29] that verse right there just feeling just
[1:29:31] drawn by the holy spirit
[1:29:34] this word was set before israel
[1:29:37] daniel was letting it be known the word
[1:29:38] was set before him it wasn't just that
[1:29:40] god was just giving him a letter
[1:29:42] but god in his mercy would set a prophet
[1:29:44] before him to do what bring reflection
[1:29:46] in their life
[1:29:48] so they could have reflection because
[1:29:50] remember you had false prophets
[1:29:53] shepherds it caused them in the old
[1:29:55] testament as well all they were
[1:29:56] interested in was their own selves
[1:29:59] they weren't interested in the souls of
[1:30:01] the people
[1:30:03] but god had prophets he had a man like
[1:30:05] micah or one think about it when micah
[1:30:07] came out there and he spoke to ahab he
[1:30:10] had said i don't want that guy preaching
[1:30:12] you know why i hate him
[1:30:14] what a thing to say
[1:30:16] you know why why do you hate him ahab
[1:30:18] because every time he preaches the
[1:30:21] presence of god comes down
[1:30:24] and i find myself under conviction but
[1:30:27] adaf that's what you need is an honest
[1:30:30] reflection
[1:30:31] that's what i want i want the holy ghost
[1:30:34] to come down i want them to bring
[1:30:36] conviction i want to see where my short
[1:30:39] areas are because every one of us in
[1:30:42] here we might have ourselves right here
[1:30:44] but once in the presence of god that
[1:30:46] mirror don't lie amen
[1:30:50] glory be to god in the highest aren't
[1:30:53] you glad for that this morning that the
[1:30:55] mirror don't lie mirror mirror on the
[1:30:57] wall who's the terrorist of them all
[1:30:59] amen
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:08] glory be to god
[1:31:10] we're not snow white but we're the bride
[1:31:13] that has come up out of seven church
[1:31:15] ages
[1:31:16] oh my we're not spiritual gods but we
[1:31:19] have been grown up in the things of
[1:31:21] almighty god in this hour
[1:31:33] think of this statement
[1:31:34] in the message the rapture
[1:31:40] repeat it again
[1:31:41] the message the rapture
[1:31:43] brother brown takes that and he takes
[1:31:45] the text of psalms 27.
[1:31:49] we looked at that last week
[1:31:51] that david said
[1:31:52] one thing i've desired
[1:31:55] and that one thing i want to seek after
[1:31:58] that i may dwell in the house of the
[1:31:59] lord
[1:32:00] all the days of my life and behold
[1:32:03] his beauty
[1:32:05] his character
[1:32:06] his fullness
[1:32:08] and inquire
[1:32:10] at his temple
[1:32:12] that's what i'm seeking for
[1:32:14] but david that's going to show up your
[1:32:15] shortcomings but that's what i need
[1:32:18] because whatever the word is speaking to
[1:32:20] me is the vitamins i need in order to
[1:32:23] get there
[1:32:28] i've been saying this for the last 15
[1:32:30] minutes
[1:32:34] but a prophet
[1:32:36] brandon picks it up again he says this
[1:32:38] the latter messages the message the
[1:32:40] rapture
[1:32:42] and i've just been drawn to these these
[1:32:44] parts and meditation thinking about
[1:32:46] things things i see
[1:32:49] brother braham said
[1:32:51] a prophet
[1:32:52] is born a prophet
[1:32:54] they're not made a prophet
[1:32:57] a gift of prophecy in the church
[1:32:59] two or three judge that before the
[1:33:01] church receives it right but the exact
[1:33:03] words
[1:33:04] he said it just like this but nobody
[1:33:07] sets before a prophet
[1:33:10] are you hearing me
[1:33:11] nobody sets before prophet these are
[1:33:14] brother brahms opinions nobody sets
[1:33:16] before a prophet
[1:33:18] that's right are you hearing me
[1:33:21] nobody sets before prophet because he
[1:33:23] was absolutely the word of god he was
[1:33:26] that word in his day and you seen god
[1:33:30] reflect amen amen
[1:33:34] and the bride of jesus christ says amen
[1:33:36] to the word
[1:33:37] i want a complete i i don't want no
[1:33:39] you're not taking any mirror from me if
[1:33:41] you want to take a mirror away you can
[1:33:43] take a mirror away from yourself but you
[1:33:44] ain't taking it from me
[1:33:46] hallelujah this mirror has come with a
[1:33:48] complete reflection amen amen god did
[1:33:51] not call me i listen friends god's
[1:33:53] already vindicated this message he
[1:33:55] didn't call me nor any other minister to
[1:33:57] try to take statements and vindicate him
[1:34:00] god has vindicated his word already
[1:34:10] amen i'm caught up in this revelation
[1:34:13] this is not a man's thoughts
[1:34:16] if that's what a person thinks it's a
[1:34:18] man's thoughts you miss the revelation
[1:34:20] of what a prophet is
[1:34:23] amen come on friends a prophet has done
[1:34:26] saith the lord
[1:34:28] you may not understand some things that
[1:34:30] he says as far as to try to make sense
[1:34:33] of it but the greatest thing we can do
[1:34:35] is have good sense and say god in your
[1:34:38] time i place it here if it's something i
[1:34:40] need to know if it's something for right
[1:34:42] now he'll make ready for it but in the
[1:34:45] meantime i want to look in the mirror
[1:34:47] and see where my shortcomings are
[1:34:50] because i'm interested in getting out of
[1:34:52] here amen amen
[1:34:57] i'm talking about understanding the hour
[1:34:59] we're living in
[1:35:01] amen
[1:35:02] i understand by the books
[1:35:05] spoken word books
[1:35:09] without this message we wouldn't
[1:35:11] understand where we're at here in this
[1:35:12] book are you hearing me i'm gonna just
[1:35:15] say it's so bold like this the bible was
[1:35:17] written for right now
[1:35:20] are you hearing me
[1:35:22] all the way down through the scriptures
[1:35:24] there all of these things which have
[1:35:26] been hidden in tight of the coming of
[1:35:28] the lord and have prophesied of this
[1:35:30] hour it's the same holy spirit that is
[1:35:34] returned to the church of the living god
[1:35:36] like it did in luke 24 to walk with you
[1:35:40] and i and show himself in the word and
[1:35:43] show you and me ourselves in the word
[1:35:47] glory be to god that's what it means to
[1:35:49] be a friend of a prophet
[1:35:52] i said that's what it means to be a
[1:35:54] friend of a prophet amen amen
[1:36:00] so i say it very clearly to you as a
[1:36:02] church of the living god and i say it
[1:36:03] very clearly and there's a pastor we
[1:36:05] tune out all other voices
[1:36:08] amen any voice that wants to rise up and
[1:36:10] talk about opinions we tune it out amen
[1:36:13] amen amen are you hearing me friends
[1:36:16] we're nowhere we're at in this hour
[1:36:18] we're not caught up in that kind of
[1:36:19] stuff we're caught up to recognize in
[1:36:21] this hour they that knew that god shall
[1:36:23] do great exploits
[1:36:25] the wise shall understand in this hour
[1:36:30] god does things in simplicity
[1:36:32] amen brother brown would even say it
[1:36:34] like this he said god says things
[1:36:35] sometimes even throw people off
[1:36:38] unbangling of god all right
[1:36:42] you mean eat your flesh and blood
[1:36:44] how am i going to do this
[1:36:47] all right
[1:36:48] now if we're going to talk about when we
[1:36:49] just close
[1:36:52] see they had enough they had enough
[1:36:54] scripture they could have pinned jesus
[1:36:55] down
[1:36:57] this is why think back
[1:36:58] think back to what the holy spirit even
[1:37:00] spoke here which we believe this all
[1:37:02] along
[1:37:03] a joshua generation with an elohim
[1:37:05] revelation
[1:37:06] that the revelation itself prevails
[1:37:10] yes
[1:37:11] they have the written word before
[1:37:13] but it's the revelation that uncovers
[1:37:16] what the writing is and brings
[1:37:18] transformation amen
[1:37:23] brother samuel what are you saying i'm
[1:37:25] saying that i'll take his opinion
[1:37:28] job what do you think about ella who's
[1:37:30] opinion i'll take it
[1:37:32] cause
[1:37:33] [Applause]
[1:37:41] listen i want the word to show me where
[1:37:43] i'm short
[1:37:44] i want it to show up you know we all got
[1:37:46] mirrors we like i mean sometimes i like
[1:37:48] mirrors that make me look trim and
[1:37:50] you know and
[1:37:52] come on some of you don't look at me
[1:37:53] like that
[1:37:54] you like them too
[1:37:56] you like certain mirrors the way they
[1:37:57] you know
[1:37:58] we all got mirrors we like
[1:38:01] there's one mirror that we need
[1:38:04] we need that perfect reflection amen
[1:38:07] we didn't need a church member of the
[1:38:08] brian we we didn't need it
[1:38:10] we didn't need it it served its time
[1:38:11] pentecost on me or served the time
[1:38:12] baptist mayor served it we needed
[1:38:15] we needed the full mirror and that's why
[1:38:18] when the word is preached even right
[1:38:20] here we're not preaching a different
[1:38:21] gospel
[1:38:22] we're preaching the word that's been
[1:38:24] vindicated backed up and god's still
[1:38:26] moving with that same word because that
[1:38:28] word is him it's the angel of the lord
[1:38:31] in the camp
[1:38:32] of the host
[1:38:34] let's pray
[1:38:36] heavenly father
[1:38:39] lord jesus
[1:38:43] i pray father god here this morning
[1:38:47] lord as we look up with honest
[1:38:49] reflections
[1:38:51] upon
[1:38:53] the word of god
[1:38:55] looking in our own lives lord i thank
[1:38:58] you
[1:39:01] lord jesus
[1:39:03] for this message that you've sent to us
[1:39:07] oh there was light here that that's true
[1:39:11] what is your prophet would pick that up
[1:39:12] from the scripture in zechariah 14 7
[1:39:16] but it was a dismal day there had been
[1:39:18] enough light
[1:39:19] to see certain things
[1:39:22] but lord god you promised
[1:39:25] in the evening time
[1:39:27] there shall be
[1:39:29] light
[1:39:31] light would come upon
[1:39:33] the word of god
[1:39:35] light would shine upon this world
[1:39:38] lord it would be your unfailing presence
[1:39:41] that would take the seeds of promise
[1:39:44] that have laid here within your word
[1:39:47] sown and ordained for this time
[1:39:50] and your presence would come
[1:39:52] and ripen
[1:39:54] those seeds
[1:39:56] from just seeds of wheat grain
[1:40:00] to me bring them forth
[1:40:02] as shoebread man
[1:40:05] manna
[1:40:07] as your prophet would refer to it over
[1:40:09] and over as that shoe bred manna that
[1:40:11] hidden manna
[1:40:13] it's
[1:40:13] shoe bread meaning
[1:40:15] bread
[1:40:16] of your face
[1:40:18] bread
[1:40:19] of your
[1:40:20] presence lord jesus
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:25] help us lord
[1:40:26] [Music]
[1:40:29] help us that our eyes would be single
[1:40:34] lord we don't want to be people that
[1:40:36] come to church
[1:40:37] and we hear the word
[1:40:39] and we just we hear it
[1:40:41] and then we leave out of here
[1:40:44] and we forget or simply
[1:40:46] don't
[1:40:47] give key to or care
[1:40:49] to the things that we're seeing
[1:40:51] we want to be doers
[1:40:54] lord god as you spoke to us even over
[1:40:56] the past few weeks
[1:40:57] to be that of a doer lord does not mean
[1:40:59] that
[1:41:00] it's us in our own efforts trying to do
[1:41:03] something but you went on to tell us in
[1:41:05] your word if we'll look into that
[1:41:07] perfect law of liberty if we'll humble
[1:41:09] ourselves
[1:41:11] if we'll lord god
[1:41:13] give ourselves to you
[1:41:16] and pray over these things when
[1:41:18] understanding comes to our life
[1:41:20] lord we understand the hour that we're
[1:41:22] living in we see it
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:25] the world is in such a a chaos such a
[1:41:28] time
[1:41:30] and yet it's it's not just that those
[1:41:32] things were prophesied to be but we we
[1:41:34] understand it
[1:41:36] not because of events that are taking
[1:41:38] place
[1:41:38] but we understand it
[1:41:40] by books
[1:41:42] we understand it by the inspiration of
[1:41:45] the almighty god
[1:41:47] the lord you have come
[1:41:49] to unfold and inspire your word to our
[1:41:52] hearts
[1:41:54] to inspire us to put us into motion lord
[1:41:58] god
[1:41:59] to draw from us like you did isaiah whoa
[1:42:02] am i
[1:42:03] a man of unclean lips
[1:42:06] you you sent your word that it might
[1:42:08] bring out of our lives a real confession
[1:42:11] that there might come forth a real
[1:42:13] cleansing
[1:42:14] because from that cleansing
[1:42:16] then will come a commission
[1:42:19] a consecrating
[1:42:21] of our life
[1:42:23] lord as daniel bowed his head and prayed
[1:42:27] and he sought you
[1:42:28] he sought your presence
[1:42:30] he began to pray
[1:42:32] as your prophet put it lord he began to
[1:42:34] pray
[1:42:35] lord is those setting aside the daily
[1:42:38] tasks there's things that david
[1:42:39] or daniel begin to just set aside begin
[1:42:42] to evaluate
[1:42:43] when he's recognizing as the
[1:42:45] understanding is coming to him
[1:42:48] oh god the more that we would understand
[1:42:50] lord really as we see more and more lord
[1:42:54] god it causes us lord god to lose sight
[1:42:58] of the things of this earth
[1:43:00] lord jesus the majority lord god of your
[1:43:03] children lord that i would speak to lord
[1:43:05] and stand here with
[1:43:07] lord god they're not out there running
[1:43:08] in the world
[1:43:10] but lord jesus there's things affairs of
[1:43:13] life
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:15] and lord god sometimes
[1:43:18] they become entrapped
[1:43:20] ensnared in
[1:43:21] things that lord has creeped into their
[1:43:23] life
[1:43:25] where they can look at here this morning
[1:43:26] and look into the mirror of your word

[1:43:44] your mercies lord
[1:43:46] lord god thank you for your mercies lord
[1:43:49] when your word would come to us lord and
[1:43:51] that mirror of the word would show us
[1:43:53] drift in our life
[1:43:56] sometimes lord it's drift where it gets
[1:43:58] caught up with the cares of life
[1:43:59] sometimes we drift lord god into wrong
[1:44:02] attitudes hurts feelings everything else
[1:44:05] lord god but father how we thank you for
[1:44:07] the mirror of the word lord and when we
[1:44:10] can just yield of ourselves lord god
[1:44:13] and look into that perfect law of
[1:44:15] liberty
[1:44:16] really humble ourselves like daniel did
[1:44:20] or jesus there's liberty
[1:44:23] there's a blessing
[1:44:25] the blessing
[1:44:26] of liberty
[1:44:28] the blessing oh god
[1:44:30] that accompanies
[1:44:32] humility to the word of god

[1:44:39] father as we give ourselves to you lord
[1:44:41] we invite you lord we invite lord god
[1:44:44] that you would come and we as we lord

[1:44:49] dying to ourselves lord

[1:44:59] could
[1:45:00] see lord god
[1:45:05] i want to be changed
[1:45:08] i want to be changed
[1:45:10] i don't want to forget lord there's
[1:45:12] things that even as we get closer to the
[1:45:15] of the way
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:28] set just right available when i i'm
[1:45:30] looking and the light is fully on there
[1:45:33] might be
[1:45:34] what would show up an ink stick
[1:45:37] on that shirt in a small place
[1:45:41] lord god
[1:45:43] this is an hour
[1:45:45] where leaven is to be searched out
[1:45:48] it's an hour lord god we
[1:45:51] we want you to search us
[1:45:54] how many would join with me in that

[1:46:39] we want to have honest
[1:46:41] reflections in this hour
[1:46:44] honest
[1:46:45] reflections
[1:46:47] we want to say what the word says lord
[1:46:50] we realize that everything lord is the
[1:46:52] word's coming forth it starts with
[1:46:54] agreeing
[1:46:55] with the world
[1:46:57] when we begin to agree with that word oh
[1:47:00] my
[1:47:00] lord sometimes it takes the height off
[1:47:02] of us
[1:47:04] but help us
[1:47:05] because we realize that what we're
[1:47:07] agreeing with is the word that's there
[1:47:09] to change us
[1:47:11] lord god may you move change our hearts
[1:47:14] change our attitudes change our thoughts
[1:47:18] granted lord may we move with honest
[1:47:20] reflections in this hour
[1:47:23] i want to say thank you lord for the
[1:47:24] privilege
[1:47:26] your god of this
[1:47:28] this mirror
[1:47:30] the mirror of your word that your light
[1:47:32] is shining on lord with such brightness
[1:47:37] thank you lord
[1:47:40] lord we say thank you
[1:47:42] because lord we can see our shortcomings
[1:47:44] we can see those things but we know
[1:47:47] that lord those things that you're
[1:47:49] making known to us
[1:47:52] you want us to draw closer to you
[1:47:57] the bride
[1:47:58] she has made herself
[1:47:59] [Music]
[1:48:01] and to her was granted the final ending
[1:48:06] that fine linen which is the
[1:48:08] righteousness of the sins
[1:48:11] oh lord jesus
[1:48:13] may we lord god like like the bride may
[1:48:16] we lord take full full opportunity
[1:48:20] looking in the mirror
[1:48:22] and giving ourselves to you
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:26] granted lord jesus
[1:48:28] in jesus name
[1:48:30] [Music]
[1:48:34] i look at this in the i look at this in
[1:48:36] the word
[1:48:38] looked at it even last week they had no
[1:48:40] idea was going to go in this direction
[1:48:41] here this week but i've looked at that
[1:48:43] with daniel of how when daniel that
[1:48:44] understanding broke daniel immediately
[1:48:47] began to go into prayer
[1:48:49] i think what a fitting time in this hour
[1:48:52] the time to really
[1:48:54] be in prayer we've got things to pray
[1:48:56] about
[1:48:57] oh yeah brother samuel this person's
[1:48:59] sick no i understand we've had that
[1:49:01] those are all requests but we've got
[1:49:02] things individually in our life and it's
[1:49:05] not just about us but there's things
[1:49:06] that god is making known to us
[1:49:09] and yes we god will lead us there's
[1:49:11] there's needs that we do pray about from
[1:49:13] one another we do pray with all that but
[1:49:15] don't limit your prayer
[1:49:17] to just request
[1:49:20] have fellowship with him
[1:49:22] talk to him
[1:49:24] what you're seeing what he's showing you
[1:49:25] in your word what he's showing in the
[1:49:27] word he doesn't do it to intimidate us
[1:49:29] are you hearing me now he doesn't do it
[1:49:31] to intimidate us he doesn't do it to say
[1:49:33] i see where you're feeling no no he
[1:49:34] doesn't do it that way he is a high
[1:49:36] priest who's touched by the feeling of
[1:49:39] our affirmations
[1:49:41] but he shows us these things in his word
[1:49:43] that you and i might give ourselves to
[1:49:46] him
[1:49:47] see what a blessing it is he could he
[1:49:49] couldn't show it to the rest of the
[1:49:50] world
[1:49:51] he couldn't do that you know what they
[1:49:53] don't want to see that i don't want to
[1:49:54] see that how many times you ever heard
[1:49:57] anybody you go to start talking or and
[1:49:59] you mean you don't have to say very much
[1:50:00] it's what it is is the character of life
[1:50:02] that's on display
[1:50:03] and they'll say no no don't go no don't
[1:50:06] go preaching at me
[1:50:07] i hadn't even said anything yet
[1:50:10] but you know what it is they don't want
[1:50:12] to see themselves in the mirror
[1:50:16] because when the mirror comes out it now
[1:50:18] becomes
[1:50:19] the responsibility
[1:50:21] of the beholder
[1:50:23] what will the beholder do
[1:50:26] with what they're seeing
[1:50:28] well
[1:50:29] i want to look into that perfect law of
[1:50:31] liberty
[1:50:33] we sing that song i want to turn up my
[1:50:35] praise i say turn up my prayer
[1:50:37] praying always

[1:50:42] closet

[1:50:46] place

[1:50:50] walking right down the middle of target

[1:50:54] understand that i know sisters would be
[1:50:56] like praise god we can go down target no
[1:50:58] that's not all my prayer time but you
[1:51:00] understand
[1:51:01] you can have
