just want to go to the lord in prayer and then we're going to go to the scripture tonight amen heavenly father we come to you lord tonight at this time of the service lord lord your presence has been here during the worship of your people dear god we can sense that presence god we ask now that you anoint your servant lord tonight you be able to come lord and speak the word through me lord to be a help to the people lord to be a strength in them an encouragement dear god to lift them up dear lord we ask these things lord in the name of the lord jesus christ and to the glory of god amen amen i'd like to read from second corinthians chapter 12 tonight verses 7 through 10. what i'd like to speak on is when i am weak when i am weak verse 7 and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelation there is given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure for this thing i beside the lord thrice that it might depart from me but he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ might rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in a reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong you may be seated the lord knows our strength he knows how feeble we are he knows how weak we are he knows that we're humans he knows he understands humanity he understands the flesh he understands how weak the flesh is and because he understands these things because he came and lived in this kind of flesh his flesh grew old they said when he was in his 30s he looked like he was about 50 his flesh grew old it grew tired he grew hungry it had he had physical needs he had mental needs he had he experienced all these things so he knows how weak we are and we realize how strong he is that we can depend on him that in our weakest times we know that he will give us strength and we can look at many different characters in the bible and see when they were at their weakest and what god did for them in that time we can look at elijah remember elijah he looked pretty mighty when he was up there on mount carmel and he was challenging those priests of baal and he you know gave the sacrifice and filled it with water the trenches with water and called fire down out of heaven they consumed the sacrifice consumed the altar and licked the water out of the trenches and then he slayed the priests and then when he was done with that why he was weak the anointing he had come out from underneath that anointing and when he came out from underneath that anointing then what he had left was his flesh and it was weak from being from god using it the way he had and so when he was weak then god said come aside for a little while i've got some crows that's going to feed you i've got some ravens that are going to feed you and some angels that are going to take care of you and comfort you and you know when elijah had lost his church he had lost everything then he was weak and then when he could call on the heavens and call for it not to reign until he called for it again he had power to shut up the heavens jacob lost all his strength he wrestled all night with the angel of the lord the angel touched him took his strength but jacob wouldn't let go just as the song said kept holding on and you know then god gave him power to become a prince amen paul lost all of his education and all of his theology he had to let all that go everything he knew everything he had learned every every uh thing that he had relied upon before he had to let all that go and when he did then god made him a missionary to the gentile moses lost all of his ability and became weak he had you know he was a great warrior in egypt but he lost all that and then 40 more years down the road when he was 80 years old god spoke to him and said now i'm going to send you back to egypt the prophet of god said moses wanted to go back with an army behind him but god sent him back with the stick and his wife and child upon a upon a mule going back to take over egypt but that wasn't what how moses wanted it moses brother branham said wanted an army behind him that's how he had planned it out but that's not how god does things could have been an army behind him then it would look like it was the power and strength of the army that brought him out but god had promised abraham that i'll bring them out with the mighty hand god passes those people who think they're something think they've got strength think they're really something and it goes to the people who know they're they're not anybody they're not looking for anything to do anything they don't think they got any strength within themselves and god uses them to serve his purpose the more you can forget your education the more you can forget brother brown said all your stuff he said the more god can use you the more you yield to god the more he can use you the problem is many times instead of us being weak we're too strong the prophet said we're too strong-headed we're too strong-willed and we want to yield to ourselves instead of yielding to god and that's why god allows things to come along to remind us of our weakness to show us that we have need that he's the one that's his might it's his strength amen when we become weak then he can make his own purpose brother branham said in the message many times when he was in the prayer line he said that he was he said i'm weak as they would come through the more they would come through and pull on that gift the weaker he would get but it had nothing to do with him telling him what was wrong with them it didn't affect that it didn't affect us saith the lord thus saith the lord was still just as strong as ever brother venom said when i'm weak he's strong amen pardon me i think about the woman during the time of the famine in the bible and elijah came by the prophet and here she was she was at the end of her road she said i've got just a little bit of meal in the barrel i've got just a little bit of oil in the cruise i'm going to make a cake for me and my son and then we're going to die she was at the end of a road there was seemingly no hope left for her there was no one she could go and borrow some more meal from nobody else had any either there wasn't anything else she could lean upon and then god asked for what she even had left that's the way god will do when you think you ain't got nothing left he'll ask for what little you've got left to see what you'll do with it see if you'll give it to him will you dedicate it to him but you notice when elijah spoke to her he said go make me a cake first then do as you said and make for you and your son so he didn't say go make me a cake and you two die he said go make me a cake first she said i've only got a little bit for one cake he said well go make me one first then do what you said and make for you and your son for thus saith the lord the mill burial not waste and the cruce of all will not run dry hallelujah she had thus saith the lord then then she could go on thus saith the lord and go make him a cake first but god tried her she was tested she was down to the end of her rope there was nowhere else left to go she was indeed in her weakness she was at her weakest state she had gave up we're gonna die then we recall as the story goes on that her son did die and she said what if what have you done to me man of god i've done what you asked and now god's taken my son so elijah took the boy carried him up to the loft where he slept laid himself upon the boy three times and prayed and said god what's happened here bring this soul back into this boy and the bible says the soul of the boy came back into him and he raised up amen god is strong he makes the impossible possible in the most impossible situations god shows up when when when lazarus was dead and in the grave three days gone then jesus came on the scene martha said i wish you'd have been here before because if you'd have been here before you could have prayed for my brother and god would have healed him but now by now lord he speaketh that didn't mean nothing to god that would his that was not beyond his strength he could bring a body back from decay hallelujah remember the time elisha they throw them bodies in on his bones they come back to life [Applause] it hallelujah matter that that he stunk it didn't matter he had decayed that wasn't beyond god there's nothing in your life that is beyond the strength of god almighty god there's nothing that you face that god can't come on the scene and turn the situation around i don't care how impossible it looks there's nothing we go through what god doesn't allow us to go through and he does it for a reason to serve his purpose hallelujah he allowed paul to be constantly buffeted by the devil but we learned on sunday that my grace is sufficient means a lot hallelujah hallelujah the bible says the mill bearer wasted not in the crucial oil never failed why was thus saith the lord remember after the crucifixion of jesus mary came to the tomb mary was sad mary had been up three days and three nights after the crucifixion she had been up she was weak she was tired she was coming to dress the body and when she got there in her weakness there was nobody there the body was gone he was missing but the voice spoke to her and said why why why why we pushed our woman she said they've come and took the body of my lord carried it away and i don't know where they took it she was weak and at this point she didn't know what to do she was at wits in what where was he what was she to do now how could she find him how could she tell the others but then that voice spoken said mary and when that voice spoke strength came into her that voice spoke her name she knew that voice hallelujah hallelujah amen then she was strong hallelujah you know abraham as time passed abraham got older and he got older and he got older and sarah got older and older and as time passed the further it looked like they got from the promise being able to come to pass no wonder sarah laughed within herself because they had reached a place where they were beyond seemingly that it could even happen but you know god let it go so far the further he lets it go the greater the miracle is that's the way he does in our lives sometimes we go through a trial we go through we're facing something and it seems like we look at it and we we don't know a way out we don't know what to do we don't know how long it's going to go on you know as humans we would like it to end pretty quick many times when we get down to pray that's what we're praying for is god to bring a quick resolution to the problem but sometimes it doesn't work that way sometimes it goes on and on and on it seems to drag on and it's like god you think does he even hear me [Music] that's when you've got to know that he is god hallelujah it's not about anything that we can do but it's what god has already done for us through christ there was nothing abraham could do but it was only what jehovah could do a lot of times brother branham said people say i'm so tempted this is in time testament worlds of god a lot of times people say i'm so tempted blessed be the name of the lord for the temptations that's hard to say that isn't it blessed be the name of the lord for the temptations for when i am weak then i am strong every son that cometh to god must first be tried and tested and these testings are more sweeter to you and dear to you than precious gold everyone's got to be tested tested to see if you'll stand in the face of of the impossible i know me and my family went through a deep dark trial some years a few years back and you know when something happens to you why you feel like you're gonna be okay or whatever you know but when it happens to a family member like your child then that's different and this had come against our youngest son and here we were you know and i was looking for a way out i was looking for a way to make the thing come to a resolution to come to an end nothing i did worked i prayed about it submitted my ideals to god let's just be honest i submitted my thoughts to god and i think if we do this and this god this will just end but it didn't work that way and it drug on and it drug on and it drove on because you know what god didn't want it just to go away he wanted my son to be totally absolved to where it would show his innocence god knows how to work things out he's got a better plan than we could come up with there was many times that we grew weak during those times do you know what helped us we knew we had people praying for us there might have been people praying for us and didn't even know what they were praying for but it didn't matter they were praying for us there was prayer requests going up for us we had our family praying for us it brought strength and times when we are weak hallelujah brother branham says when i'm weak then i'm strong because i know there's a blessing laying ahead that satan's trying to get me away from it but i just keep going on anyhow i just keep going on anyhow satan just you satan buffeted you brother i'm saying no there's a blessing just on the other side of it god wants to bless you god wants to deliver you god wants to set you free god wants to bring you out we just have to be patient that's where we have problems sometimes is with our patients we're not patient amen to wait for the promise to come [Music] after we've done all that we can do then be patient we know none of us ever pray god please give me some patience because we know the bible says tribulations worketh patience but that's why we face them that's why we go through them god's given us patience some of us struggle with it more than others we live in a world that's full of impatience you know we used to have dial-up internet you know on a modem you know make that sound that it would make maybe maybe you can remember that sound you know and you could you could be in the middle of a college test and lose connection and there it all went right and it was so slow and then we got in it was faster and it still wasn't fast enough so they made it faster and it's still not fast enough now we've got some of the fastest internet out there and we're still punching the mouse because it's not fast enough we're impatient people fast food and i've seen people in the line the fast food line complaining because it wasn't fast enough this stuff that you're going to feed me that's going to make my cholesterol go up that's going to make my sugar go up it's just going to make my triglycerides go up you're not giving it to me fast enough [Applause] [Music] instant potatoes instant oats what's it all about you know then they invented microwaves you know because it wasn't quick enough to cook it on the oven or the stove so we got microwaves now i remember when they came out when i was a kid some of you young ones here probably grew up with microwaves microwave popcorn when i was a kid we got popcorn my dad put popcorn in a in a pot and shook it over the fire back and forth to pop the corn now they just pop a bag in the microwave and push a button that says popcorn they don't even got to take time to punch in the time they just push a button that says popcorn this world is full of impatience and it's just making the people more impatient they want things quicker and quicker and quicker and quicker but that's not how god does it if god would give it to you just the second you said that you thought you had a need you don't want you'd be a bunch of spoiled brats but god wants you to be sons and daughters of god [Applause] tried through the fire come out the other side victorious hallelujah brother branham says god don't have any little weak parts and then big strong parts he's just all together god and he said if you just had a shadow of god in you that's enough power to create the world because god doesn't have any weak parts he's all together strong it's god and it's strong right now and every believer in here has life eternal which is god's spirit in you enough power that'll raise up the dead that'll heal the sick that'll set orbits into conditions it reminds me of those gates of the spirit you know brother branham liking them to be in planets and they could set them in their proper orbit sometimes you know the devil can get in there and influence those gates and get us all out of orbit so to speak influence your affections influence your affections for your children so that you're looking at them more with filial love than you are agape love agape love wants to see him saved filio love just wants to cling on to him but agape love wants to see him saved at any cost friends the life we're living in here is very short the bible says our life's like a blade of grass it comes and it goes it's like a flower blooms and then it wilts and it's gone job said what happens after man dies he said the flower comes back up but what happens to man and god you know job was in his weakest state he had church members telling him he was a secret sinner that's why he was being beset by so many things that's why so many things were going wrong something's wrong with you job the random said when things are going against you like that it doesn't mean that you've done something wrong it doesn't mean god's trying to correct you it just means that you're being tried as a son and daughter of god god's working on you to perfect you hallelujah the spirit that's in you that same spirit that you've got in you will raise you up on the day of resurrection amen that's how much power resides in a born-again believer your flesh may be weak but you've got power on the inside as brother branham said if you've got just a little shadow of god in you if you just got a little speck of god you've got all the power you need well i'm not very much you know i'm not a preacher and i don't pray for the sick and i you know i'm i'm just you know a stay-at-home mom and hey there's nothing wrong with that you've got just as much right to pray for your children as anybody else more right than the preacher's god god's got to hear your prayers too hallelujah you've got power to raise the debt hallelujah many times we think that when we're feeling good that's when we can really give a good testimony that's when our testimony really could count the prophet said that's not when your testimony counts he said it's when you're down and weak and troubled that's when your testimony counts oh i'd say just just the lord moved on paul to sing that song right before i came out hallelujah just hold on hallelujah adam says as long as you've got some of yourself in there god can't do nothing with you but when you empty out right empty all of your own ideals out empty all yourself out paul said i'll glory in my infirmities of my weakness thanking god brother adam said i got all of me out of me when i get everything out of me then god can come in but as long as you got some of myself in there then god can't get in who's strong enough to tamed the devil which one of us here is strong enough to say well i'll take him on god's the only one strong enough to tame the devil but remember probably said if you just had a little speck of god in you that's enough hallelujah don't try to take him on yourself but if you've got just a speck of god in you you're more than a match for him hallelujah there was a voice one time that tamed the devils put clothes back on them and set them free in their mind and put them back in their right mind and that same voices give promise to us brother ram says pour out all of yourself and let the holy ghost come in and flood every part of you saturate every part of your being deny your own abilities the prophet said i i don't know about you but anytime a problem presents itself to me i'm always trying to figure a way to solve that problem and the problem presents itself to the family i'm always trying to figure out a way to solve that problem and i'm constantly have to be reminded god didn't put me here to solve problems god put me here to trust in him he's the problem solver and so sometimes i know to people especially in my church something to be going on they'll think well brother jerry ain't moving on that very quick i don't even know if he knows what's going on i'm just waiting because i know i can't handle it myself but i know when god tells me what to do and i do what god says do then there's going to be some results but if i try to jump in it myself i'll just make a mess of it so i wait on the lord when i first started pastoring there was a dear brother spoke to me and he said brother jerry said if i could pass anything along to you to help you starting out it would be patience just wait on god there was brother donnie reagan that told me that said if i could pass on anything to you it would be patience hallelujah paul talked to god he talked to him jesus in the form that he was before he became flesh and he told paul my grace is sufficient boy that means a lot what do we have need of god my grace it's sufficient deliver me god my grace is sufficient to take you through hallelujah i tell you when i studied on that message noah found grace oh that did something for me it showed me just how much grace really means when it says my grace is sufficient it's sufficient that's what we need is his grace paul said i will glory in my infirmities that's a strong statement i'll glory in my infirmities well it's hard to do that but when you realize that it's god allowing you to come down to your weak stage so that he can come on the scene when things when i was younger a younger father had younger children when things would arise knees and that i would think man why'd this have to come along what a hassle this is but as i got older my children would call on me dad i i've got to go to the hospital and i've got to have surgery and i need somebody to take me up there and stay with me and drive me home yes i get to be their hero today dad my car's broke down what am i going to do i'm out here stuck somewhere i'll be right there why i got a chance to be a hero that's the way god is when we've got a need then he has a chance to come be our hero he's got a chance to come on the scene and do something for us he wants to do for his children it's not a hassle to him when you call on him in need it's it's not oh they're going to take up my time again i had something else planned no he's right on time right on the scene even when he's late he's on time like with lazarus hallelujah brother branham said talking about paul paul said except i get exalted i want to build some great seminaries everything else some great something another lest i get exalted above abundance in this revelation god let the messenger of the devil keep me beat down then when i'm weak i'm strong brother ram said it's the growing pains of grace growing pains of god's grace when you're experiencing growing pains that's a good thing you're mature and you know i always look at the beginning of a new year and i look back over the year that i just come through and i want to see how i've progressed from that over that year am i better off than i was when the the last year had started how much closer am i to god's what i'm saying not anything about physical things or you know really or or about things of this world but am i closer to god do i have more understanding than i had the year before does this word mean more to me than it did before hallelujah am i not in the same place with god but have i got closer have i moved further along am i further along in my journey and my cloak getting closer to the end growing pains of grace we got to yield ourselves to the spirit of god and go where the spirit says go brother talks about he calls him god's soldiers in hebrews 11. he says or rather heroes god's heroes and he says out of weakness they were made strong they had to get weak before they could get strong out of the weakness they were made strong hebrews 11 32 says what more what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and barack and em samson and japheth and david and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stomped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax valiant that means mighty strong they wax valiant in fight and turn to flight the armies of the aliens isaiah 35 3 it says strengthen ye the weak hands confirm the feeble knees say to them that are of a weak fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with the recompense he will come and save you hallelujah god comes on the scene and he always comes on the scene at the right time i was my mother had come down to visit us and uh on the day she was to fly back while it was raining really hard and where i live when it rains really hard there's always a lot of accidents people have trouble driving in the rain lord help them if the snow comes they have trouble driving in the rain and a lot of accidents and so i was taking my mother to the airport in the rain and as i got on the other side of nashville why i seen the traffic that was going west was just backed up and i thought boy i really don't want to get into that stop and go stop and go in the rain not knowing how long you're going to be sitting there and so i thought i'll take a different route home so after i dropped her off i went and got on a different route that went up a different way around nashville and i thought i'll just ride this route out and uh but you know on that route you can only go 55 miles an hour so it was a little slow and so as i got on up around that route and got up to where it intersected with 65 i thought well i'll just get off on 65 and go take it south back into nashville and go that way and i got off on 65 and it was stand still traffic i sat there a little bit and i thought my goodness i'm not going to sit in this traffic i'm just going to get off the next section i'm going to turn around i'm going to go back and get back on that other route and just drive 55. so that's what we did i had michael with me and so we went we got off on the next exit we went back up to bradley parkway and got back on it and started back around that way and we hadn't went far at all and the traffic came to a standstill and i didn't know what it was and i thought why is the traffic moving here this is a route around nashville it always moves and so i got a hold of mina and she was at home and i told her and so she helped me get onto the traffic cam so i could see what was going on up there so i pulled the traffic cams up on my phone and there was an accident just up just up the road a little ways from where we were there wasn't no exit up there or entrance or nothing like that i don't know how the accident happened but i told michael i said michael that was god had his kid off on 65. if i stayed on here we'd have perhaps been in that accident and we were sitting there and we watched on the traffic cams and we saw about four ambulances coming there taking people out rushing them out we sat there i don't know how long we sat there a long time there was no you know it seemed like no sense what to do you know there was traffic behind you traffic around you everybody was at a standstill then all of a sudden the police had got out and started walking up there and they were turning people around having to turn their cars around and go back to the last exit and get off and the policeman actually said do you know where you're at good enough to to find your way home from there and i said yes i can and so we went back and you know where we ended up back on 65 again but i was in a total different frame of mind we had to wait through some traffic to get up where we were going but i was in a different frame of mind because i kept telling michael michael it was god that delayed us it was god that had all this delay because otherwise we would have been in that accident but god knew what he was doing he prevented that hallelujah he knows what he's doing even when we don't know what we're doing hallelujah god's always there to take care of you we had no idea accident was going to happen up there how could anybody know that but god knew amen and he kept us out of it because friends i i figured out in time if we would have stayed on there we'd have been riding that that uh pile up and it was so bad like i told you there was about four or five ambulances came in there taking people out oh praise the lord god's always looking out for us my youngest daughter and youngest son they used to ride to college together and uh my son had learned this back road from the college over to the to get on the route to come home and it was through a development you know a neighborhood of real nice houses but it was kind of hilly and it was in the wintertime and there was a little bit of ice on the road we get freezing rain down there and there was a little ice on the road and you come down the hill and there's a stop sign at the bottom of the hill and here he was coming down there in that car and he went to put on the brakes and the car just started sliding around he thought oh my what's going to happen because i can't make i can't stop from that stop sign and the the other the route that was coming through there didn't have a stop sign it was it wasn't a four-way stop it was only a two-way stop and he come down through there and there was no cars coming and he slid right on through that intersection he gave a testimony at church we had a thanksgiving night where we come for thanksgiving after thanksgiving and we we just had a testimony night and he got up and gave that testimony how god had his hand upon them hallelujah god's always watching out for your friends there's no trouble that can come your way you know when abraham was 100 years old god said i'm el shaddai i'm the breast of god come and nurse for me nurse strength for me nurse new life from me abraham nurse from the word he nursed from the breast of god it turned him back young again hallelujah what it was it was getting him ready for the miracle brother branham said god knows how to get us ready for the miracle we've got a miracle we're waiting on and that miracle is called the body change that miracle is called the resurrection that miracle is called the rapture and we're waiting on that miracle and god is letting us go through things friends to get us ready for that miracle he's getting us ready to go home he's getting us ready for the body change he's getting us ready for the resurrection he's getting us ready to leave this world and go home go where we came from hallelujah brother branham says he's letting us nurse his own strength his own spirit as a baptism back into our weak bodies to give us faith for the rapture and give us faith for the miracle hallelujah just nurse from the lord hallelujah just feed on his word hallelujah oh brother sister how am i going to change my body it's just going to happen it's his word he said let there be light and there was light and he saw that the light was good and friends he is god has told us that we are going to have a new body he told us the dead in christ is going to rise first then we're going to be changed in a moment and tweaking of an eye that's his word so it's got to happen we don't have to scientifically figure it out it's god's word he's going to bring it to pass all we've got to do is nurse from him feed on the word of the hour take strength from god hallelujah how am i going to fight my battles amen i'm not he's going to fight him for me hallelujah i'm going to lean on him lean on the everlasting arm hallelujah he said the battle is mine saith the lord friends he's already won the victory hallelujah the war has already been won sometimes we may feel like we've we've come through something been defeated sometimes we may feel like god i didn't trust you like i should have i failed this test don't worry god gives you another chance if you fail the test he'll bring you back around and let you take the test over again and you'll keep taking it until you pass it hallelujah friends we're not going to make it to heaven by the skin of our teeth we're not going to make it to heaven make having a d on our testimony report card you're going to get straight eggs because god's going to make you keep taking the test till you get it right you're going to be ready you're going to be ready for these things to happen you'll be ready for the body change so what am i going to do when when my loved one appears to me i heard somebody say one time maybe it might scare me to death if all of a sudden i look around and they're there no i won't why we're expecting them [Applause] and you're going to be changed in a moment of tweaking an eye don't worry about it hallelujah
