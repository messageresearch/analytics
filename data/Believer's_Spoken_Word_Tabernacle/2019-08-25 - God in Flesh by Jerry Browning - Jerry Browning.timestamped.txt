[17:24] thank God
[17:28] so after I got
[17:32] from the initial shop
[17:34] they're not
[17:36] I gave it to God
[17:38] I was more concerned not about me going
[17:42] felt more concerned about my wife
[17:45] leaving the family behind my wife
[17:48] well-being and all made sure that all
[17:50] was well with her without me and then
[17:57] came the day of
[17:59] for me to get operated Sammy was there
[18:02] all my family was there took me in about
[18:06] noon I guess I was under the operating
[18:10] table
[18:12] honeyBun five hours of so woke up
[18:16] I was just so soared and devastated
[18:20] that was Friday evening
[18:25] come Saturday morning at 4:30 in the
[18:27] morning I had my medication for my pain
[18:33] and that was the last time I took
[18:35] medication for pain woke up about 8:30
[18:39] they asked me I said I'm not in pain I
[18:42] said I'm not in pain at all you know so
[18:46] they sent me home Saturday morning and I
[18:51] was sore and with in my stomach we're
[18:53] data and all the cutting so forth and so
[18:55] on and then I did take the pain
[18:58] medication but the only reason I took it
[19:01] for it to make me sleepy you know I
[19:03] never lost one night of sleep
[19:07] [Applause]
[19:14] I didn't think I was gonna sleep the
[19:17] person I was shot when I woke up in the
[19:18] morning and so I'm really thankful for
[19:22] God for that and then we got the report
[19:27] back toxicology and then mrs. Miller
[19:32] tells me because before she said you
[19:35] know there might be a 50/50 chance they
[19:37] might have to do some radiation and when
[19:41] I went to see her she said I got good
[19:43] news for you Carlos I said there is
[19:45] there's not a trace nothing at all they

[40:32] Liberty and a joy to serve the Lord
[40:34] isn't it they met he really he really is
[40:37] our life you know it's something that
[40:39] our desire is we're not just you know we
[40:43] were in devotion the other night there
[40:45] at the house and a statement was made
[40:46] and it just you know how it is sometimes
[40:48] a statement is made and it just jumps
[40:50] out to you and you know we're not just
[40:53] we're not just believing on him we're
[40:58] serving him there's a great difference
[41:02] you can believe whatever a doctor says
[41:05] and a doctor can say this and that you
[41:07] could say that that's true you know and
[41:09] they tell you you need to stop doing
[41:10] this and stop doing that you say I
[41:12] believe that and then you go out and you
[41:15] know you get your value mill and
[41:18] everything else you're not serving it
[41:21] there's a difference between believing
[41:23] and serving but when you really believe
[41:25] it you serve amen and I'm so thankful
[41:30] that that service it's not left just to
[41:33] our strengths but he gives us power for
[41:38] service amen aren't you glad for that
[41:43] amen he ignites and gives faith to us so
[41:47] we're just thankful to the Lord I want
[41:50] to I just want to say on behalf of my
[41:52] wife and Paul and the family we
[41:55] certainly
[41:56] appreciate each of you that were able to
[41:58] to make it yesterday to the graduation
[42:01] party and the other thing I want to say
[42:05] that we're just thankful for each and
[42:07] every one that you didn't have to but
[42:10] you you helped out those getting there
[42:12] early and setting up and the different
[42:15] ones that that pitched in with different
[42:16] things to do and we we just so
[42:18] appreciate that I guess the one good
[42:21] thing about it is
[42:22] thank the Lord well I've got two years
[42:24] before the next one you are gonna
[42:30] graduate lay hands suddenly on no man
[42:41] but give you a little time to save up
[42:45] again for it too
[42:47] so we just just thankful to the Lord for
[42:50] that I want to say even for all the
[42:53] graduates that's here we've got a lot of
[42:54] graduates from college in and others
[42:57] from high school this year and just it's
[43:00] just a wonderful achievement I want you
[43:01] to understand that I've mentioned that
[43:03] before a few times but it's just a
[43:05] wonderful achievement amen that that has
[43:08] been done amen in your life and we want
[43:11] to say we're proud of you very proud of
[43:13] you because there's a lot of work
[43:15] [Applause]
[43:21] and I also want to mention there's a
[43:24] couple things here there's two things
[43:27] out there on the prayer request table
[43:29] and one of it is is there's a card for
[43:31] brother John la Fontaine and brother
[43:34] John la Fontaine I mentioned it during
[43:37] the prayer meeting here on Tuesday night
[43:39] and some of you probably have seen it
[43:41] posted on the internet but for brother
[43:43] John lefante they've diagnosed him with
[43:45] stage 4 cancer but we're believing the
[43:50] promise and that's what brother that's
[43:53] what brother John is standing up on that
[43:56] and you know brother John when you see
[44:00] the video so it's nothing that he would
[44:02] get anything new for me but brother John
[44:03] said I just want you understand I don't
[44:05] need the words of sympathy he said I
[44:07] don't need homemade remedies or feeling
[44:11] sorry for me
[44:12] he said I've got a promise got a promise
[44:15] so you know and you all know brother
[44:20] John he can he can say that in that way
[44:22] and you know because sometimes when you
[44:24] look at something like that you you know
[44:28] we're looking at a promise we're not
[44:29] looking at trying to make arrangements
[44:32] well I'm gonna go pick out my casket or
[44:34] anything like that no we've got a
[44:36] promise we've got a promise and we've
[44:39] got multiple promises where God had
[44:42] declared his healing power over and over
[44:46] and over so we have a card out here if
[44:51] you would if you wouldn't mind just
[44:53] signing the card if you have a testimony
[44:56] please write it on the paper there's
[44:58] paper that's out there or if you don't
[45:00] feel like there's enough room to write
[45:02] all the chapters you can type out an
[45:05] email send it into the library
[45:09] sister Will's aunt could get that
[45:10] printed off and then we can get all that
[45:12] sent we want to be able to send the car
[45:15] just of an encouragement to brother John
[45:18] and just just a note of what of what his
[45:21] ministry has meant to you over the years
[45:26] is that Alright
[45:29] amen and so you know it was a brother
[45:33] here in the church said yeah a scripture
[45:37] here a little while back and you know
[45:40] I've preached from that scripture and
[45:42] looked about it and I think it was a
[45:44] brother ray I think it was you sent me
[45:45] this text
[45:46] it was dealing with sacrifice and it
[45:49] talked about forgetting out of the book
[45:52] of Hebrews I believe to communicate for
[45:55] with such sacrifices God is well pleased
[45:59] and sometimes it is a sacrifice to
[46:02] communicate can you say Amen I'm gonna
[46:07] talk about when we need something I'm
[46:08] talking about to be able just to
[46:10] communicate with somebody else just to
[46:13] encourage them so we want to remember
[46:15] that also the there's a wedding
[46:18] invitation out there for brother Brian
[46:20] and sister Mariah's wedding and there is
[46:23] a sign-up sheet that is out there the
[46:26] invitation has the address for the
[46:29] reception as well as where the wedding
[46:31] will take place and that's on November
[46:33] 9th on the paper if you'll put down your
[46:37] name if you're planning on attending the
[46:39] name the name of the family and then the
[46:41] number of persons that would be coming
[46:43] in the family so if you
[46:46] that'll be out there for a little little
[46:49] right both of those things on the
[46:51] prayer request table the other thing is
[46:53] is Lord willing here at the end of the
[46:55] service I know that many of you is any
[46:59] kids went back to school yet okay okay
[47:04] yeah can we have some had some other
[47:05] teachers okay so at the end of a threat
[47:10] at the end of the after the ministering
[47:12] of the word this morning we want to have
[47:14] prayer over those that are going back to
[47:17] school colleges and different things the
[47:21] teachers as well as I know we have
[47:23] teachers and I appreciate all that as
[47:24] well there's a lot of work there and we
[47:27] just I believe with all of my heart that
[47:30] God is watching over us I don't say
[47:35] those words loosely I say them because
[47:37] it is the truth when when the Hebrew
[47:43] children went into the fiery furnace
[47:45] they went into the midst of that fire
[47:48] that fire was set to destroy him but
[47:53] they went in there and God met him there
[47:58] and when they came out of there there
[48:00] wasn't a smell the Bible says not one
[48:03] fray of their clothing was planted
[48:07] they didn't even smell like the
[48:11] pollution of smoke and the Bible says in
[48:15] Revelations 9 that those demonic powers
[48:18] have been released and it's smoke that
[48:21] has come out demonic demonic forces have
[48:27] been released Satan has been released
[48:30] here upon this earth but if he's been
[48:34] released
[48:36] guess who's also come down the Lord
[48:41] Jesus Christ amen he is here in the
[48:46] fullness of his word and of his spirit
[48:48] and he said I'll never leave you nor
[48:52] forsake you I'll be with you even in you
[48:55] to the end of the world amen
[48:58] so don't fear Esther you're placed here
[49:02] for such a time as this and God is
[49:06] faithful
[49:06] amen who watches over so we're gonna
[49:09] have prayer here at the end of the
[49:10] service over those that would be going I
[49:13] want to say we appreciate brother Jerry
[49:15] I appreciate him being here this morning
[49:22] we just want God to come and just anoint
[49:26] that chip of a diamond of a gift that
[49:29] God has placed in our brother's life the
[49:31] Holy Spirit have come down put that up
[49:33] on the record of God's Word and the Holy
[49:36] Spirit will bring out of that record of
[49:39] God's Word and bring it present right
[49:42] before us and discerns the very thoughts
[49:45] and intents of the heart and ministers
[49:47] to us what we have need of amen I'm
[49:51] expecting that this morning once you a
[49:53] man could we stand are you gonna sing
[50:02] you all have had to exercise this
[50:05] morning some y'all didn't even stand you
[50:11] god bless you this morning

[52:51] [Music]
[53:26] [Music]
[53:38] [Applause]
[53:56] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[54:00] your presence Lord that's here with us
[54:05] Lord for how you've blessed in the
[54:07] worship Father bless your people now we
[54:12] ask Lord for you to come and anoint us
[54:14] Lord God open the pages of the word Lord
[54:18] and make them live to us Lord we ask for
[54:21] your guidance you know and the needs of
[54:23] the people asked your God that you will
[54:26] anoint us the world with a bill to be
[54:28] able to help and encouragement
[54:29] strengthen to the people in Jesus name
[54:31] Amen
[54:34] turn your Bibles to John chapter 1 verse
[54:38] 14 now we know in John chapter 1 and
[54:42] verse 1 it says in the beginning was the
[54:46] word and the Word was with God and the
[54:47] Word was God
[54:49] now we want to read from John 1:14 and
[54:54] it says and the Word was made flesh and
[54:57] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[55:00] the glorious the only begotten of the
[55:02] Father full of grace and truth
[55:05] Amen you may be seated what I'd like to
[55:09] speak on today is God in flesh now you
[55:18] know how could it be the blood of God
[55:23] God has no blood but yet there was a
[55:29] sacrifice that needed to be made in
[55:32] order for us to be redeemed
[55:35] so God created the blood brother Brennan
[55:42] says he created the blood cells you know
[55:45] the blood cells comes from the male and
[55:49] you take a chicken if the if the hen has
[55:55] never been with the rooster why she can
[55:57] lay her eggs
[55:58] but they'll rot she can set on him and
[56:02] set on him and set on him and and put
[56:05] him in the right atmosphere but those
[56:10] eggs will never hatch because there's
[56:14] there's no life in them they've never
[56:17] been Germanized
[56:19] LeBron said that's what's wrong a lot of
[56:21] times in the church we got a bunch of
[56:24] eggs sitting there there's never been
[56:25] germanized and so he said we need to
[56:29] clean out the nest and start over
[56:32] but God created the blood cells and
[56:37] formed this flesh cells in Mary
[56:41] he had God had to to come in order to be
[56:47] tempted like we are to be tested like we
[56:52] are and he couldn't do that in the
[56:55] spirit he in order to be able to do that
[56:59] he had to come down in flesh and so he
[57:03] created this the blood cells and the
[57:07] body the flesh cells and Mary and then a
[57:11] child was born and it had to come as a
[57:15] child because it had to come the same
[57:17] way we came
[57:18] just not by sex and so but it had to be
[57:23] born in flesh like our flesh it had to
[57:28] be born in flesh that would rolled it
[57:33] had to be born in flesh that could feel
[57:36] tiredness that could feel hunger that
[57:40] could feel temptations brother Branham
[57:42] said he even had to be tempted in
[57:45] sexual things then he had in he had to
[57:49] be in flesh like we are in order to be
[57:52] tested in tempted and tried and in these
[57:56] ways because otherwise he couldn't have
[58:00] been the author of our faith he couldn't
[58:05] he couldn't do this in spirit so he had
[58:08] to come down in flesh so we know that
[58:11] God came down in the flesh of Jesus
[58:13] Christ and he suffered all these things
[58:17] but at the same the same time that it
[58:20] was God in flesh
[58:21] it had to be man in order to be kinsmen
[58:26] to us
[58:27] it had to be flesh man that's a
[58:31] beautiful type in the book of ruth of
[58:33] how that and they only you know went
[58:37] into the country of mold and there her
[58:41] sons married and she had two
[58:44] daughter-in-laws her sons died her
[58:46] husband died and and she had her two
[58:48] daughter-in-laws and she told him said
[58:50] go back to your people i've got nothing
[58:53] left for you and of course root says
[58:57] that she wouldn't return back she says
[58:59] your people will be my people your God
[59:01] will be my god wherever you Lodge our
[59:04] lodge wherever you sleep that's where
[59:05] I'll sleep wherever you're buried I'll
[59:07] be buried there and so then we see the
[59:12] beautiful type of Boaz
[59:14] as the kinsman redeemer as he comes out
[59:16] and takes off his shoe and and makes a
[59:19] public Proclamation before all the
[59:23] people that he was redeeming what they
[59:27] only had laws redeeming back her estate
[59:30] and he had to rein in redeeming the
[59:33] woman he gained a bride
[59:36] and so Jesus Christ came and he made a
[59:41] public display of being beaten of being
[59:45] whipped of being locked of being
[59:48] crucified a public display of shedding
[59:52] his blood that he could redeem the
[59:55] church in order to get a bride
[1:00:07] when he died on Calvary and he cried my
[1:00:11] God my God why hast thou forsaken me
[1:00:13] that was a man that was a man that had
[1:00:19] felt that part of God lift from him
[1:00:25] because God couldn't die but Jesus had
[1:00:30] to die as man would die he had to give
[1:00:33] his life so he was man when he said that
[1:00:37] but then on Easter morning when he rose
[1:00:42] and he had the keys of death and of Hell
[1:00:46] that was more than a man that was my god
[1:00:51] that was God in flesh when he walked
[1:00:57] here on earth and he felt virtue go from
[1:01:05] him when the woman touched His garment
[1:01:06] he felt virtue leave him that was a man
[1:01:12] when I often told my wife when I
[1:01:16] preached I said it doesn't take as much
[1:01:17] out of me to preach as it does to pray
[1:01:19] for people it takes more it did it
[1:01:23] really as a drain on my body praying for
[1:01:26] people and it's Jesus as a man had to
[1:01:32] fill that drain of that virtue but that
[1:01:36] it healed that woman and stopped her
[1:01:38] blood flow that was God gyrus remember
[1:01:45] gyrus came to Jesus said his daughter
[1:01:48] was definitely sick and while he was
[1:01:52] talking one of the servants came and
[1:01:53] said she's died don't bother don't
[1:01:56] trouble the master any longer
[1:01:59] and gyrus is heart how much says the
[1:02:02] father his heart must have sank
[1:02:04] but jesus said fear not but only believe
[1:02:11] and see the glory of God and so he goes
[1:02:16] to gyrus house and there lays the girl
[1:02:20] and he said she's not dead she just
[1:02:24] sleeps and the Bible said those that
[1:02:27] were present there and laughed him to
[1:02:29] scorn and you know what he did with all
[1:02:32] those unbelievers he put him out he
[1:02:37] wasn't there to put on a show before
[1:02:40] them
[1:02:43] God don't put on a show or act for
[1:02:46] anybody so he put him out and once he
[1:02:51] put him out well then he been
[1:02:57] that he could he could touch into
[1:03:01] another realm and in another realm
[1:03:06] could tap into another language and
[1:03:11] could speak and say Tibbett da which
[1:03:14] means daughter arrives taking her by the
[1:03:18] hand and there she was in that spirit
[1:03:22] land she lays she was dead she had done
[1:03:25] patched into the spirit lamp but his
[1:03:28] voice spoke and reached into that spirit
[1:03:31] land and pulled her back and brought her
[1:03:35] to life that was God in flesh that was
[1:03:40] my god he was a man when he came down
[1:03:48] off the mountain
[1:03:49] he felt hunger when he had preached to
[1:03:54] the people and he felt tired but when he
[1:03:59] took five loaves and two fish and fed
[1:04:04] 5,000 people that was more than a man
[1:04:08] and I often remember my dad preaching on
[1:04:14] that and he would say he didn't just
[1:04:18] multiply the fish in the loaves he said
[1:04:21] but it was baked bread it was cooked
[1:04:24] fish
[1:04:30] that was more than a man a man couldn't
[1:04:33] do that and I just wonder
[1:04:39] you know he went and he taught in the
[1:04:41] temple
[1:04:45] He healed the sick the lame walk the
[1:04:50] Deaf heard the dumb spoke the blind
[1:04:52] received her sight the dead was raised
[1:04:56] how could people around him not see that
[1:05:00] that was God in flesh but yet even the
[1:05:06] priest out of the temple could not
[1:05:08] recognize that this was the Messiah they
[1:05:12] had this wasn't like that it should have
[1:05:16] been unheard of with them they they were
[1:05:20] looking for a messiah to come but they
[1:05:24] had took down through the years and
[1:05:27] through their ministry had riche made an
[1:05:31] image of what they thought he would come
[1:05:34] like and when he came it didn't match
[1:05:36] the imagery that they had in their mind
[1:05:39] because he came as a child because he
[1:05:43] came in a way to where evil could be
[1:05:46] spoke of him to wear that they said that
[1:05:50] his mother Mary had been with the
[1:05:52] soldiers or something and that he was
[1:05:56] born illegitimate he coming away dead to
[1:06:01] them was not prestigious they weren't
[1:06:05] expecting a child but he had to come as
[1:06:08] a child because he had to redeem our
[1:06:11] bodies and to redeem our bodies he had
[1:06:14] to come in these bodies and why couldn't
[1:06:19] they recognize him for in him dwelleth
[1:06:21] all Nisour the Godhead bodily
[1:06:24] you wonder why they couldn't why they
[1:06:28] couldn't look and see these things jesus
[1:06:30] said if you don't believe me believe the
[1:06:31] works he came from heaven he was going
[1:06:41] back to heaven Judith came from Hell he
[1:06:47] was going back to hell Jesus
[1:06:54] it was deity in flesh
[1:07:05] Jesus would be returning back to take
[1:07:08] the born-again with him friends I'm
[1:07:12] gonna tell you something Satan's waiting
[1:07:14] for his - he's waiting for his children
[1:07:18] -
[1:07:26] remember when Jesus hung on the cross
[1:07:30] was dying as I said as a man
[1:07:33] there was a thief on either side of him
[1:07:37] the one says if thou be
[1:07:42] the son of God and save yourself and
[1:07:46] save us - there was that question if if
[1:07:53] you me you know if you be a divine
[1:07:57] healer than heal this person then do
[1:08:01] this to prove it I don't have to prove
[1:08:04] anything to unbelievers God proves
[1:08:10] himself to his own children but that's
[1:08:13] because they're believers and they will
[1:08:15] accept that they will believe it
[1:08:17] but the world can see it happen and
[1:08:22] witness it with their own eyes and still
[1:08:25] not believing that's why they couldn't
[1:08:27] recognise God in flesh when Jesus walked
[1:08:30] here on the sea shores of Galilee they
[1:08:35] seen the things he done they ought to
[1:08:37] know and that man couldn't have done
[1:08:38] those things but their eyes was blind
[1:08:47] you wonder would you being able to tell
[1:08:50] that it was God in flesh if you would
[1:08:52] have been there brother man says how are
[1:08:56] you now because how you are now is how
[1:09:01] you would have been then if you're
[1:09:05] believer now you would have been a
[1:09:06] believer then if you can see God in
[1:09:11] flesh today you would have seen God in
[1:09:13] flesh then Jesus says in John chapter 10
[1:09:28] verse 25 I told you you believe not the
[1:09:31] works that I do in my father's name they
[1:09:33] bear witness of me but you believe not
[1:09:36] because you're not of my sheep as I told
[1:09:40] you my sheep hear my voice I know them
[1:09:43] and they follow me can you say praise
[1:09:45] the Lord I'm so glad that I know his
[1:09:49] voice I'm so glad that I can recognize
[1:09:52] the voice of God among all the voices
[1:09:55] that are in the world today among all
[1:09:57] the voices there that are surrounding
[1:10:00] this this entire message that we claim
[1:10:04] to believe all the voices that do all of
[1:10:07] that we can recognize the true voice of
[1:10:11] God and the voice of God wasn't silenced
[1:10:19] when brother Branham left the scene we
[1:10:22] still have the voice with us today and
[1:10:25] my sheep know my voice and a stranger
[1:10:29] will not follow he said I give unto them
[1:10:35] eternal life do you know what that means
[1:10:36] that means OE God's own life I give unto
[1:10:43] them eternal life and they shall never
[1:10:45] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[1:10:48] out of my hand my father which gave them
[1:10:50] me is greater than all and no one is
[1:10:53] able to pluck them out of my father's
[1:10:55] hand
[1:10:55] and I and my father are one there he was
[1:11:02] proclaiming it with his own voice I'm
[1:11:04] God in flesh and you know what it caused
[1:11:09] among them instead of them recognizing
[1:11:11] and looking at the works and seeing the
[1:11:13] things you know what he calls to them
[1:11:14] they picked up stones to stone him and
[1:11:18] he said for what good work do you stone
[1:11:21] me what good works I'll show you my
[1:11:26] father of which of these do you stone me
[1:11:31] now I want to move a little closer look
[1:11:35] with me if you would in Luke chapter 17
[1:11:51] Luke chapter 17 verse 26 through 30 as
[1:11:59] it was in the days of Noah so shall it
[1:12:03] also so shall it be also in the days of
[1:12:07] the Son of Man they did eat they drank
[1:12:10] they married wives they were given in
[1:12:11] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[1:12:13] into the ark and the flood came and
[1:12:15] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[1:12:18] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[1:12:21] drank they bought they sold they planted
[1:12:22] they builded but the same day that lot
[1:12:25] went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[1:12:27] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:12:29] all even thus shall it be in the day
[1:12:31] when the Son of Man is revealed I know
[1:12:36] these things I'm going to speak at this
[1:12:37] point if you've been around this message
[1:12:40] in any time at all you know them but I
[1:12:43] look around and I see a lot of faces I
[1:12:45] don't recognize of course I'm not here
[1:12:46] all the time so I'm not going to
[1:12:48] recognize everybody but I don't know who
[1:12:51] all where you're at in this and so I
[1:12:54] felt led to bring some of these things
[1:12:55] out as it was in the days of lot in the
[1:13:03] days of lot when Sodom was going to be
[1:13:06] burned there was three that came and
[1:13:09] visited Abraham in the plains of Mamre
[1:13:12] and when they came remember just about
[1:13:17] four or five days before this
[1:13:22] Abraham's name had been Abram and it had
[1:13:27] been Sarai just about four or five days
[1:13:30] before that these three men came to
[1:13:33] visit Abraham
[1:13:37] but there was one that stayed with
[1:13:39] Abraham while the other two went down to
[1:13:41] Sodom to get lot out of Sodom and that
[1:13:45] one that was standing there he didn't
[1:13:47] say he didn't call him Abram he said
[1:13:51] Abraham he didn't say Sarah he said
[1:13:57] Sarah where is Sarah your wife
[1:14:01] surely that the one who had changed
[1:14:05] Abraham's name was the one that was
[1:14:07] standing before it because his name had
[1:14:13] just been changed about five days prior
[1:14:15] to that and he stood there and then with
[1:14:21] his back to the door of the tent you
[1:14:23] know he said I'm going to visit Sarah
[1:14:25] about the time of life and she's going
[1:14:27] to have a son that's going to be born to
[1:14:30] you and the Bible said that Sarah
[1:14:34] laughed within her heart stirred me an
[1:14:38] old woman have pleasure with my Lord in
[1:14:41] him an old man
[1:14:44] and there was just back to the quarter
[1:14:46] tent and look that wasn't a myth it was
[1:14:50] a man because he had sat there and eat
[1:14:54] meat and bread with Abraham and had
[1:14:57] drank milk it was a man but it was God
[1:15:02] in flesh floor it wasn't it theophany if
[1:15:06] the apne doesn't need to eat the God had
[1:15:11] come down Edel him had come down in
[1:15:14] flesh stood there with his back to the
[1:15:18] door of the tent and said why did Sarah
[1:15:20] laugh and that was the last sign that
[1:15:25] was given before the promised son would
[1:15:28] arrive it was the last sign given before
[1:15:31] Sodom was destroyed and that was
[1:15:39] promised to happen again as it was in
[1:15:42] the days of life so shall it be in the
[1:15:45] days when the Son of Man is revealed we
[1:15:54] were to receive a sign
[1:15:57] and it's the last sign that was to be
[1:16:01] given to the bride before the coming of
[1:16:03] the promised son I want to read some
[1:16:08] things some excerpts out of some
[1:16:10] different messages and I know that you
[1:16:14] that here you listen to the messages of
[1:16:16] brother Branham that you no doubt you
[1:16:19] hear these things but just for for
[1:16:22] everyone just to hear them I feel red
[1:16:24] LED to read them but here where the
[1:16:28] Branham says

[1:26:18] the Bible said that in the last days
[1:26:21] right at this time before the coming of
[1:26:23] the Lord there to be a spirit come on
[1:26:25] the earth in veiled and human flesh man
[1:26:28] like it was at Sodom and would be able
[1:26:31] to discern the thoughts of the mind like
[1:26:33] that angel did there as he was in the
[1:26:36] days of Sodom how many understands that
[1:26:38] just raise your hands
[1:26:40] Alleluia do you believe that pardon me
[1:26:56] turn with me to first John chapter 4
[1:27:16] first John chapter 4 begin reading at
[1:27:19] verse 2 everybody know you the Spirit of
[1:27:24] God every spirit that confesses that
[1:27:25] Jesus is coming the flesh is of God and
[1:27:28] every spirit that confesseth not that
[1:27:31] Jesus is come in the flesh is not of God
[1:27:33] and this is the spirit of the Antichrist
[1:27:36] where of you've heard it shout should
[1:27:39] come even now already is in the world
[1:27:42] year of God little children and have
[1:27:44] overcome them because greater is He that
[1:27:46] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:27:51] [Applause]
[1:27:53] how many believes the word is eternal so
[1:28:00] how the how the word was wrote when the
[1:28:04] Holy Spirit moves on his men to ride it
[1:28:06] it was wrote in a certain way for a
[1:28:09] reason and when John wrote this down
[1:28:14] he didn't say every spirit that
[1:28:18] confesses not that Jesus has come in the
[1:28:20] flesh but is present tense come in the
[1:28:26] flesh
[1:28:27] this was after Jesus had died this is
[1:28:31] after he rose this is after he had
[1:28:32] ascended he was gone off the scene and
[1:28:35] now what it was it was his believers his
[1:28:37] followers and John saying every spirit
[1:28:40] that confesseth not that Jesus is come
[1:28:43] in the flesh is not of God
[1:28:49] where the brandon said
[1:28:53] when he turned his back to the audience
[1:28:56] and called people out
[1:28:59] he said it's LOM in flesh again just
[1:29:05] like he was at the days in the days of
[1:29:08] Abraham it's L of him back in the bride
[1:29:12] human flesh again in the last days doing
[1:29:15] the same thing notice he didn't he
[1:29:20] didn't say it's Elohim in me he said
[1:29:24] it's L o him in the bride because that
[1:29:30] didn't change when brother Branham left
[1:29:32] to see I think there's a lot of people
[1:29:36] today that think that once the brother
[1:29:38] ray left the scene that ended it but
[1:29:41] it's not that wasn't God's total purpose
[1:29:45] if it had it been then he wouldn't have
[1:29:48] took brother Branham off the scene like
[1:29:49] he did but he took brother Branham off
[1:29:51] the scene because he wanted you to be
[1:29:54] able to see God in you in yourself
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:09] who says here in the spoken words
[1:30:11] original seed notice what harmony Jesus
[1:30:16] never did anything until seen of the
[1:30:19] father where the father showed him first
[1:30:21] harmony between God and Christ see John
[1:30:25] 5:19 so will the bride he shows her his
[1:30:30] word of life he shows her and she
[1:30:33] receives it she never doubts it nothing
[1:30:36] can harm her not even death for it the
[1:30:39] seed be planted the water will rise it
[1:30:42] up again amen then I got a great big
[1:30:45] hallelujah here's the secret the word is
[1:30:51] in the bra and the mind of Christ to
[1:30:55] know what he wants done with the word
[1:31:00] the word is in the Bott it wasn't just
[1:31:03] that it was going to be in the Prophet
[1:31:05] and it wasn't just the Prophet knows
[1:31:09] what God wanted done with the word but
[1:31:11] he said it's in the bride and the bride
[1:31:13] knows what he was done with or people
[1:31:25] that only believe in playing tapes
[1:31:27] they're missing out they don't believe
[1:31:34] in the fivefold ministry they're missing
[1:31:36] out that same God that spoke through the
[1:31:40] Prophet is the same table that's here
[1:31:42] today he's the same God that speaks
[1:31:45] through the fivefold ministry today
[1:31:47] preparing this ride to go on the rapture
[1:31:54] brother Branham said say what I said not
[1:31:58] play what I said
[1:32:01] he said say what I said giving authority
[1:32:07] to the new to the ministry tell the
[1:32:10] people what I said Jesus told Peter he
[1:32:19] says when you converted strengthen the
[1:32:21] brother the word is in the bride the
[1:32:29] mine of Christ to know what he wants
[1:32:31] done with the word she doesn't in his
[1:32:34] name
[1:32:34] she has thus saith the Lord then it is
[1:32:39] germanized so the Holy Spirit waters it
[1:32:42] until he grows and serves his purpose
[1:32:44] they do his will a man I believe that no
[1:32:47] one can persuade them different they
[1:32:49] have thus saith the Lord or they'll keep
[1:32:51] still then they will do the works of God
[1:32:54] for it is himself in them continuing his
[1:33:02] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[1:33:06] his days all things when he was here he
[1:33:08] did not complete all when he was here
[1:33:10] for it was not time yet
[1:33:18] God wasn't just here to heal through
[1:33:22] brother branham i-i've you know
[1:33:23] sometimes people think all mine I've got
[1:33:25] this sickness I didn't look like it just
[1:33:27] been back there in that time and got
[1:33:29] into prayer honor had him call me out
[1:33:33] that was a sign that was a sign that's
[1:33:41] what it was meant for and brother
[1:33:45] branham continuously turned around and
[1:33:47] said you lay hands on one another you
[1:33:50] pray for him you take this prayer cloth
[1:33:54] you lay it on them these signs shall
[1:33:58] follow them to believe
[1:34:03] hallelujah it was a sign but the same
[1:34:09] God that healed the people there is the
[1:34:12] same God today that heals people today
[1:34:18] and it's it's not any power that I
[1:34:23] possess as far as a man
[1:34:29] but
[1:34:31] you know God uses men let me say this
[1:34:37] yesterday I was talking over at the
[1:34:44] graduation gathering that they had for
[1:34:46] Paul and I was standing there talking to
[1:34:50] sister Betsy
[1:34:53] and she was saying how God healed her
[1:34:56] when I was here the last time hildreth
[1:34:58] from depression I suffer from depression
[1:35:06] when she came up here to be prayed for I
[1:35:08] knew how to get ahold of God to be to
[1:35:12] understand what she was feeling what she
[1:35:14] was going through God allows those
[1:35:17] things sometimes God healed her I told
[1:35:22] my wife I said I've suffered from
[1:35:24] anxiety I said I had people come up to
[1:35:27] be prayed for that were suffering from
[1:35:29] anxiety and God healed them
[1:35:32] that wasn't me but that's the same God
[1:35:37] that was here when brother Branham was
[1:35:39] here the same God that was in flesh then
[1:35:42] is in flesh today but there's people
[1:35:47] that will look at you it's not just God
[1:35:49] in the flesh the ministry it's not in
[1:35:51] the bride it's God in you and there'll
[1:35:56] be people that are around you every day
[1:35:58] and they won't be able to recognize that
[1:36:02] it's God in flesh in front of them again
[1:36:05] but they'll have no excuse on the day of
[1:36:08] judgement because God will have a
[1:36:10] manifested himself in the by why do you
[1:36:15] think these people come to us when
[1:36:17] they've got a means they have your
[1:36:19] church pray for me they've witnessed
[1:36:24] that God answers the prayers here I had
[1:36:32] someone come a few years ago to the
[1:36:36] church and they had got married to a
[1:36:42] young man that used to come to our
[1:36:43] church that our back slid
[1:36:45] and him and her came back and she was
[1:36:49] dying of cancer and she come up to be
[1:36:54] prayed for and I prayed for her then I
[1:36:57] went down to the hospital with them that
[1:37:00] that week and I prayed with her before
[1:37:03] the doctors went back to they were going
[1:37:05] to take some more imagery of where the
[1:37:08] cancer was and I prayed with her again
[1:37:11] they took her back there and the doctors
[1:37:14] came out after the story said we can't
[1:37:16] find it I said I understand it was there
[1:37:21] but now it's gone
[1:37:24] now you would think would something like
[1:37:27] that happened that that individual would
[1:37:29] realize that that was God and this God
[1:37:33] healed them like that that they would do
[1:37:35] everything they could to surrender their
[1:37:37] life to God but they didn't they left
[1:37:41] right back out of the church and turned
[1:37:43] around and said some very foul things
[1:37:45] concerning me why couldn't they
[1:37:49] recognize that it was God in flesh but
[1:37:54] there's people that won't recognize that
[1:37:56] you are God in flesh today it's Jesus
[1:38:01] working through you it's his wife you
[1:38:09] know I had people say oh I can't live it
[1:38:12] like sister so-and-so
[1:38:14] well that's because you need to get
[1:38:16] saved my sister Sola so you need to get
[1:38:22] filled with the Holy Ghost because I
[1:38:23] said she couldn't leave any live it
[1:38:26] either if it wasn't for having dogs life
[1:38:29] in her
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:37] brother Brennan said talking about the
[1:38:39] bride tree he said the same life that
[1:38:42] was in the bridegroom is in the bride
[1:38:46] tree and it can't bear fruits without
[1:38:50] her so it had to be the same life in the
[1:38:54] bride tree the same lie that sin God is
[1:38:57] the same light that's in you you can't
[1:39:01] no more die than God can die this body
[1:39:04] can die but you'll never die I told my
[1:39:14] mom I said the other day I don't know I
[1:39:16] just got to thinking about my dad and I
[1:39:19] got to wondering what he looked like and
[1:39:22] you know I can go to pictures of him
[1:39:25] when he was a young man but yet I still
[1:39:28] wonder what is he exactly look like
[1:39:31] there now but I knew one thing he didn't
[1:39:38] look like he did when he left here
[1:39:46] when I was growing up there was a time
[1:39:54] specially as a teenager you know how
[1:39:55] teenagers go through those those stages
[1:39:58] you know and it used to really irritate
[1:40:04] me because people would say are you
[1:40:06] brother brownies son and I would say I
[1:40:13] got a name and you know I kind of wanted
[1:40:20] to be known for me I wanted people to
[1:40:24] know me for me not just know me as
[1:40:27] brother browning son let's be honest
[1:40:31] sometimes when people would find out as
[1:40:32] brother in law your brother browning son
[1:40:38] my kids couldn't testify to that
[1:40:45] but friends back in 1982 when we were
[1:40:52] starting this work and I watched my dad
[1:40:58] how that God was in him and how God led
[1:41:05] him and I saw him when he had just when
[1:41:08] people thought he were wrong he was
[1:41:10] wrong
[1:41:12] and he had this felt like he had to
[1:41:14] stand alone
[1:41:15] I remember different ministers when he
[1:41:19] was first starting out he would invite
[1:41:21] different ministers you know he wanted
[1:41:22] to come and they would they were kind of
[1:41:25] standoffish and wouldn't come
[1:41:34] but God has proven this way but as I
[1:41:40] watched him friends I saw a real man and
[1:41:46] after that when somebody was asking me
[1:41:50] who I was I didn't say well I'm Jerry
[1:41:51] Brown and I said I'm brother brownies
[1:41:53] boy you know James Brown and I'm his son
[1:42:00] I wanted to be identified with you and
[1:42:07] that's the way it is with the Bride of
[1:42:08] Christ we're not looking for our own
[1:42:10] identity we want to be identified with
[1:42:13] him brother Branham says when a woman
[1:42:25] marries a man disagreeing with him
[1:42:27] it'll just be some kind of a fuss
[1:42:30] continuously but when a man and his wife
[1:42:33] is girlfriend has a spouse when they are
[1:42:37] in perfect harmony like one soul in one
[1:42:39] mind because they're going to be one
[1:42:42] flesh then when the church can get in
[1:42:46] such a harmony with God until the
[1:42:48] manifestation of the bridegroom is
[1:42:50] manifested in the bride because they're
[1:42:52] going to be why
[1:42:59] the message of Christ and mystery of God
[1:43:02] revealed values now you can see now the
[1:43:09] endtime message why it's rejected can
[1:43:12] you
[1:43:13] now no denomination but the revelation
[1:43:17] of his mystery see no denomination the
[1:43:19] revelation God is not known by
[1:43:22] denomination he's known by revelation
[1:43:24] look God in his body Christ and Christ
[1:43:30] in his body the bride oh my god made
[1:43:35] manifest in Christ Christ made manifest
[1:43:38] in the bride as God took from the body
[1:43:42] of Adam the woman and she fell then God
[1:43:47] has took from the body of Christ his
[1:43:49] flesh his body which is his word and is
[1:43:53] bringing out bringing a bride out that
[1:43:56] won't fall by denomination or creed no
[1:43:59] sir but she's coming back with the pure
[1:44:01] unadulterated Word of God being
[1:44:04] manifested I hope every man that hears
[1:44:09] this tape every woman will understand
[1:44:11] that see she is a second Eve but she's
[1:44:15] not breaking and spoiling her skirts of
[1:44:18] purity and holiness to her husband
[1:44:20] she'll stay with this word regardless of
[1:44:23] what anybody says you can have all the
[1:44:25] XQ mean to compose you want and all the
[1:44:27] affiliations she stays with the word
[1:44:35] where the word manifests today
[1:44:38] I think of that little story that
[1:44:43] brother Bentham tells about that little
[1:44:47] boy that was afraid of the storm you
[1:44:50] know and his mom was trying to assure
[1:44:56] him not to be afraid of the storm and
[1:45:00] said you know God's watching out over
[1:45:02] you
[1:45:04] and he's protecting from the storm but
[1:45:07] he didn't want his mommy to leave him
[1:45:09] and he said I want to God with some
[1:45:12] flesh on him you look around you you're
[1:45:21] seeing God with some flesh on there
[1:45:30] God's manifested in this bride in the
[1:45:33] same time and Friends he's getting us
[1:45:35] ready to leave this earth we've got
[1:45:43] we've already got our ticket I don't

[1:47:08] emotions I like liveliness I don't like
[1:47:14] things to be dead
[1:47:15] I always appreciate preaching here at
[1:47:18] this church
[1:47:28] less than for the Sam definitely father
[1:47:38] we thank you Lord for your words today
[1:47:42] Lord herdsmen Lord that we can see you
[1:47:47] and one another today Lord did you said
[1:47:52] by this job all men know that you're my
[1:47:56] servants that you have loved one for
[1:47:59] another and the Bible says how can you
[1:48:04] say you love God if you don't love your
[1:48:07] brother who how can you say you love God
[1:48:09] who you can't see if you don't love your
[1:48:12] brother who you can't see Lord the
[1:48:16] probably said there will come a time
[1:48:17] when the only love that will be left
[1:48:19] will be in the bride and we're seeing
[1:48:22] that Lord the perverse perversion in the
[1:48:26] world today Lord were seeing it in a
[1:48:29] sodomite condition Lord to where they
[1:48:33] are now Lord passing laws in different
[1:48:36] states Lord where it would prevent us
[1:48:41] Lord from even be able to hardly preach
[1:48:43] on Sodom preach on the cansada might
[1:48:47] condition Lord to say anything against
[1:48:52] homosexuality lord it would be against
[1:48:54] the law what they're wanting Lord is
[1:48:57] they want to come and try to infiltrate
[1:48:59] our churches the Lord I know before Lord
[1:49:03] that you allow that to happen you'll
[1:49:05] take us off this face of this earth but
[1:49:08] it's just showing the side of my
[1:49:10] condition that this world is him and it
[1:49:13] has to be in that condition dear God
[1:49:15] before you come but we know Lord dent
[1:49:19] there wasn't one drop of water that hit
[1:49:23] land until Noah and his family were safe
[1:49:27] in the ark Lord the Prophet said there
[1:49:31] wasn't one bit of fire that hit Sodom
[1:49:36] until lada been took
[1:49:38] until Abraham Lee said Abraham wasn't
[1:49:41] even down there he'd come out
[1:49:42] twenty-five years ago Lord there won't
[1:49:49] be one bond strike here there won't be
[1:49:53] one thing of destruction happened before
[1:49:58] the bride's touch I pray you bless your
[1:50:02] people today dear God I pray you'll
[1:50:04] bless the word to them in Jesus Christ's
[1:50:07] name Amen
[1:50:28] [Applause]
[1:50:39] you know I think it's just so much that
[1:50:42] was that was said but you know those of
[1:50:46] you listening to the message and if
[1:50:48] you're not gone into the message you
[1:50:50] seem to get interesting and remember
[1:50:54] this right here
[1:50:55] a person can set down and do Bible study
[1:51:01] after Bible study and even when we come
[1:51:05] here to hear the word as what was spoke
[1:51:08] this morning in the scripture just kept
[1:51:10] ringing through my heart
[1:51:11] flesh and blood have not revealed this
[1:51:16] unto you
[1:51:19] it takes the Holy Ghost it takes the
[1:51:24] Lord God to reveal his worth I want you
[1:51:27] to understand God desires to reveal
[1:51:31] himself to you that's what God desires
[1:51:38] to do there's a lot of people who carry
[1:51:41] a lot of big names in this world that
[1:51:44] don't know you they don't know me they
[1:51:46] could care less about us then what's
[1:51:49] your vote but they don't care about
[1:51:53] to get their vote to do what they want
[1:51:55] to do but very God who created this
[1:52:02] earth that we're standing there Saint
[1:52:05] God who made man in his own image in
[1:52:09] every star to hang in his position I'd
[1:52:13] say he is greater he's bigger then then
[1:52:18] whoever the most important person is
[1:52:20] seem to be in this world that same God
[1:52:23] would make himself so little to come
[1:52:27] down and speak to our hearts and move in
[1:52:32] our lives
[1:52:33] that's real greatness right there and to
[1:52:38] change us live inside of us I think God
[1:52:42] for that word it's a sign
[1:52:45] God gave a sign in this hour how we
[1:52:48] thank God for the sign knowing amen but
[1:52:52] to recognize what the sign was declaring
[1:52:55] to us in this hour that what God it was
[1:52:59] doing there and that same God is doing
[1:53:02] now
[1:53:04] he's the same yesterday and today and
[1:53:07] forever amen don't you love him amen
[1:53:12] we want to have prayers here
[1:53:16] and I want to just invite those as the
[1:53:21] children as well as the those of you
