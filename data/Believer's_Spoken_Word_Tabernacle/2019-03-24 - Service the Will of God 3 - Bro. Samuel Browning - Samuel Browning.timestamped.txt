[32:27] it is what a powerful name this was
[32:32] reading the other day studying with
[32:34] Israel and they come in Isaiah 62 and
[32:39] how that God moving there to recall his
[32:43] previous deliverances his power and I
[32:46] love how the scripture says it it says
[32:48] when the waves were parted of the Red
[32:50] Sea the waves were saying the Lord of
[32:54] Hosts is his name when the waves were
[32:57] parting the Lord of Hosts is his name
[33:00] aren't you glad that you have a name
[33:04] Amen his name is his nature is him his
[33:08] character it's not lifeless it's his
[33:11] life
[33:12] amen that is a powerful name Amen we
[33:16] just thank God for His mercy amen this
[33:19] morning and so good to be together
[33:21] and we want to just go right into the
[33:25] word this morning that's just God will
[33:28] just just direct us here I want to go to
[33:32] First Samuel chapter 10
[33:58] for samuel chapter 10
[34:03] we want to move forward a little bit
[34:05] some things as the Lord will direct us
[34:07] will reach back and pick up on Saul as
[34:10] we continue to move forward here we have
[34:13] been looking at that thought on serving
[34:15] the will of God
[34:18] there's no way that we could serve the
[34:21] will of God unless it's made known to us
[34:24] and we know that God's mind and his will
[34:30] a lays here in print before us but
[34:33] without the Holy Spirit to reveal it we
[34:36] don't know his will concerning it so -
[34:42] think of it - potentially to have here
[34:44] within our hands to know the will of God
[34:47] or to have the will of God but yet how
[34:50] we need the Holy Spirit to actually
[34:54] reveal to us his will verse 17 and
[35:04] Samuel called the people together unto
[35:07] the Lord to miss me and said unto the
[35:11] children of Israel as the Cyndi's words
[35:13] thus saith the Lord God of Israel I
[35:19] brought up Israel out of Egypt and
[35:22] delivered you out of the hand of the
[35:25] Egyptians and out of the hand of all
[35:28] kingdoms and of them that oppressed you
[35:31] and ye have this day rejected your God
[35:36] who himself saved you out of all your
[35:41] adversities and your tribulations you
[35:45] know right here something's wrong it
[35:49] should it shouldn't have even had to
[35:50] have went even to this place because
[35:52] it's already been told before you've
[35:54] rejected the Lord but now right here
[35:57] this should there shouldn't have been
[35:58] anything else that should have been no
[35:59] other scriptures that should have just
[36:01] been you know what we had the wrong
[36:02] thought forgive us we were wrong it
[36:06] shouldn't nothing else should have had
[36:08] to been said because this of what has
[36:10] been declared you have this day rejected
[36:13] your God who himself saved you
[36:17] of all of your adversities and your
[36:20] tribulations well didn't God use men he
[36:23] did Nehemiah under inspiration called
[36:26] him saviors but it wasn't the men that
[36:30] delivered him it was the Lord God it was
[36:34] the Lord God and ye have said unto him
[36:36] notice you have said unto him nay but
[36:40] set a king over us now therefore present
[36:44] yourselves before the Lord by your
[36:46] tribes and by your thousands let's just
[36:51] let's just ask the Lord for his
[36:52] leadership this morning anybody like to

[37:04] morning Lord and this solemn assembly
[37:07] Lord a gathering Lord that your God but
[37:11] it's not called by man but a gathering
[37:14] Lord that has been assembled by you and
[37:17] Lord as you have expressed your God in
[37:20] your word that wherever two or three are
[37:23] gathered together in my name there will
[37:26] I be in their midst also Lord Jesus we

[37:55] myself just to be found hidden behind

[38:10] where every circumstance is every
[38:12] situation you know that Lord and we're
[38:14] mindful of it and we're mindful of our
[38:17] inability Lord
[38:18] dear God to actually come and meet that
[38:20] need though Lord it might be something
[38:23] when someone would Lord express a need
[38:25] maybe there would be a scripture or a
[38:27] quote we could actually mention that to
[38:29] him but Lord what
[38:31] really would need would be the Lord to
[38:33] actually speak to their heart and
[38:35] deliver whether it's that scripture that
[38:38] quote or whether it's just that
[38:39] expression of Christ in our life to
[38:41] reach out to him Lord God father we need
[38:44] you Lord

[40:06] Lord by faith father help us this
[40:09] morning we pray in the name of Jesus
[40:12] Christ amen amen god bless use your
[40:15] being seated I want to just keep on
[40:21] reading there if we could and I'll say
[40:23] it's been good to have brother David and
[40:25] sister Jessica here with us a little
[40:27] Michael and got to spend just a few
[40:31] hours there with them and certainly in
[40:35] privileged to be able to do that we want
[40:39] to continue here with verse verse 20 now
[40:43] I want you to watch this you find even
[40:47] in God's God's order of things which I
[40:50] won't dwell on so much this morning but
[40:52] you find that Saul has already
[40:54] he's been anointed king over all Israel
[40:58] in the presence of Samuel remember in
[41:01] the previous chapter the Lord Himself
[41:04] spoke to Samuel and let Samuel know that
[41:08] I'm gonna be sending a man to you out of
[41:10] the tribe of Benjamin and he'll be
[41:12] coming to you tomorrow and this is who
[41:15] you shall anoint to be over my people
[41:17] and you always find things when God
[41:20] would actually when someone would be
[41:22] moving into office it's always something
[41:24] that isn't all the way out in public but
[41:26] it actually takes place in secret first
[41:29] and then it comes forth to be made known
[41:31] and that's a pattern that you can go on
[41:33] with David and on and on but you look
[41:35] here of how that Saul has already he's
[41:37] been anointed to be king but now it's
[41:41] setting forth behold before the entire
[41:43] assembly and so now you know Saul and
[41:47] and sand Samuel you know the the
[41:50] anointing oil has already been poured
[41:52] out upon saw how be it it was poured out
[41:55] with a vial and not to dwell on it too
[41:57] much but you realize what a vial is a
[41:59] vial is judgment a vial is judgment so
[42:02] the outpouring of yet the Holy Spirit
[42:05] that of the vial of oil that is poured
[42:08] out upon Psalm is something that when
[42:10] you look at it he is not really under
[42:13] the judgment like the baptism of the
[42:15] Holy Ghost would come upon the soul and
[42:17] lift you and I above the judgment
[42:19] placing us in Christ but rather that
[42:22] vial itself as the anointing of the Holy
[42:24] Spirit would be poured out a person
[42:26] could have the Holy Spirit anointing
[42:28] their life and yet still not be
[42:30] converted so when we look at this and
[42:33] you find of how that it would go on here
[42:35] in verse 20 the Bible says when Samuel
[42:37] had caused all the tribes of Israel to
[42:40] come near the tribe of Benjamin was
[42:42] taken and when he had calls the tribe of
[42:44] Benjamin to come near
[42:46] their families the son of maitre was
[42:47] taken and saw the son of Kish was taken
[42:50] and when they saw him they could not he
[42:53] could not be found
[42:54] therefore they inquired of the Lord
[42:56] further if the man should come he
[42:59] thinner and the Lord answered behold he
[43:02] hath hid himself among the stuff and
[43:04] they ran and fetched him fence and when
[43:07] he stood among the people he was higher
[43:10] than any of the people from his
[43:12] shoulders and upward
[43:14] now remember back in the opening part of
[43:17] 1st Samuel 9 the Bible says that he was
[43:19] a goodly young man he was a goodly that
[43:23] word the very first time that those
[43:24] words are used goodly it's the same word
[43:27] that God would use in the beginning and
[43:29] behold God saw it was good so there were
[43:33] things that were arranged in the right
[43:35] way when we would look at saul saul was
[43:37] someone that when we would look at it he
[43:40] would no doubt be arranged but his
[43:42] arrangement maybe you know it's a
[43:43] handsome guy is a tall fella he was
[43:46] arranged according to what the people
[43:49] themselves wanted to see they were
[43:52] looking at now think about it it would
[43:54] not have been fitting within this
[43:55] particular place to God to present them
[43:58] some little ruddy boy at this time
[44:00] because that's not what they looked at
[44:02] as the strength to be able to fight
[44:04] against the opposing army they looked at
[44:07] it as strength that had been so moved to
[44:09] carnality that they looked at strength
[44:12] itself being that of size and and that
[44:14] of stature but you know what it is in
[44:16] size and stature on the outside that was
[44:19] what matters what matters is is how big
[44:22] is God on the inside because that's what
[44:24] it comes down to you can take a person
[44:26] you know when you look at it like this
[44:28] you can take a person that has you know
[44:30] known God for years and years and years
[44:32] and maybe they know the scriptures know
[44:34] the message and whatever more but yet
[44:36] they've not let God really have the
[44:38] right away within their life there's a
[44:39] lot of knowledge there's a lot of things
[44:41] that they know but yet when when we look
[44:43] at it that you can take a person that
[44:45] God has just taken ahold of that
[44:47] person's life and if that person can
[44:49] just forgive themselves in such a way
[44:52] and just you know yielding to God you
[44:54] watch how God can feel right down
[44:56] in that life and God can begin to open
[44:58] things within that heart you know they
[45:01] may not be able to speak a lot of deep
[45:03] things here and there but there is a
[45:04] life where they're living from a deep
[45:06] resource and let me tell you something
[45:08] they live a life that other people say
[45:10] you know what I know there's something
[45:12] different about them and I want that joy
[45:14] that they have it's not just the
[45:16] strictness by which we live it's got to
[45:19] be a joy that the real Holy Ghost
[45:21] produces within our life a real joy in
[45:25] the Lord
[45:26] now when you look at this how that you
[45:28] know here is Saul that's taken within
[45:31] this moment he's higher than you know
[45:33] all the people it looks like this is the
[45:35] guy now watch I want you to pay
[45:36] attention to the wording here if you
[45:38] look in verse 24 samuel said to the
[45:41] people see him whom the LORD hath chosen
[45:46] that there is none like him among all
[45:50] the people and all the people shouted
[45:53] and said god save the king
[45:56] then samuel told the people the manor of
[46:00] the kingdom and he wrote it in the book
[46:02] and he laid it up before the lord and
[46:04] samuel sent all the people away every
[46:07] man to his house there's a thing when
[46:12] samuel would start into this year he
[46:14] would begin to tell them the manor of
[46:16] the kingdom you know you can the Bible
[46:18] you well not the Bible but you know even
[46:20] the phrase that you can talk about of
[46:22] even how a tree leans many times it'll
[46:24] fall you can look at the direction and
[46:27] see a pathway sometimes the way things
[46:29] are going and notice Saul
[46:31] here he is that the direction that
[46:33] Israel is taking and how that Samuel
[46:35] under inspiration he can tell them this
[46:37] is going to be the manner of the kingdom
[46:39] when you look back in other previous
[46:41] places in the scripture here and I think
[46:43] of that what we just read in verse 24
[46:45] see him whom the Lord had chosen that
[46:48] there is none like him among all the
[46:50] people you remember that God had already
[46:53] said in Deuteronomy 17 and God let him
[46:56] know when you come into the land which
[46:58] the LORD thy God giveth thee and shall
[47:01] possess it and shall dwell therein and
[47:03] shall say I will
[47:05] a king over me like as all the nations
[47:08] that are about me notice I will set a
[47:11] king over me and you find that
[47:13] inspiration that's the same inspiration
[47:15] when we trace it all the way back that
[47:18] led the rebellion in heaven it was a
[47:20] situation that when you when you look at
[47:23] this rebellion it is a situation where I
[47:26] will rose up you know you always look at
[47:29] how the enemy the enemy is never able to
[47:32] submit himself you realize that he's
[47:34] never able to submit himself but here he
[47:37] rises up with ambitions and this is
[47:40] exactly here the inspiration whereby
[47:43] that that Israel is being moved and God
[47:45] let him know this is what's going to
[47:47] happen when you come in the land I will
[47:50] set a king over me but notice in verse
[47:52] 15 it goes on to say thou shalt in any
[47:55] wise set him king over thee whom the
[47:58] Lord thy God shall choose now you know
[48:02] there's a big difference in setting a
[48:04] king over of who you chose and a king
[48:07] who God chooses you realize a bacon they
[48:11] were setting a king over them and it
[48:13] would perceive when we look at it
[48:15] through the Scriptures he would look at
[48:17] it then his goal that saw was the chosen
[48:19] of the Lord but reality God only picked
[48:23] out what it was that was the desire
[48:25] within the heart of the people I tell
[48:28] you right now they never would have
[48:29] accepted somebody who would have been
[48:31] ready somebody who would have been small
[48:33] they would never have accepted that
[48:35] there had to be somebody that would
[48:38] match the desire that would be there in
[48:40] their heart and they and they they chose
[48:42] this king you know we could say like
[48:44] this they voted and elected this king
[48:46] but that's why brother mem said dogs men
[48:48] are not elected into office they are
[48:51] anointed into office because it's
[48:54] different when God chooses that man and
[48:57] then God presents that man and the Holy
[48:59] Ghost says we recognize the choosing of
[49:02] Almighty God there's a great difference
[49:04] here within these searchers great
[49:08] difference the Bible goes on to say in
[49:10] acts 13 21 but here you know Paul is
[49:14] picking this up afterwards they desired
[49:17] a king
[49:19] and God gave unto them saw the son of
[49:23] Kish a man of the tribe of Benjamin by
[49:25] the space of 40 years they desired a
[49:28] king now remembers we we looked at this
[49:31] here that it was it was God's desire
[49:34] that God was going to set up a king over
[49:37] Israel but to see how that within it
[49:40] safe to knowing the plan of God here he
[49:43] gets ahead and he pushes Israel into
[49:46] this place for them that they begin to
[49:49] request something and but their request
[49:51] and the motivation that the mode is the
[49:54] desires behind it are not in line and in
[49:57] tune with God's desire oh my now watch
[50:01] out watch out this will take place here
[50:03] how that you know Samuel will go on in
[50:05] verse verse Samuel chapter 12 verse 6
[50:08] the Bible says how that Samuel now is
[50:11] called the people and he says it is the
[50:13] Lord that advanced Moses and Aaron and
[50:17] that brought your fathers up out of the
[50:20] land of Egypt you know you think about
[50:22] the scripture in the book of Hebrews
[50:23] when it speaks about even those who were
[50:26] appointed to that of high priest it said
[50:28] no man taketh this honor unto himself is
[50:32] that right it is not something that a
[50:34] man would take it unto himself but he
[50:36] whatever that God has in God's desire it
[50:39] is God making known his honor upon that
[50:43] life and it's God's choosing oh my this
[50:45] is exactly what you and I when we look
[50:48] at it we look for the honor of God which
[50:51] is his blessing his life to be poured
[50:53] out upon that word to vindicate that
[50:56] word and here God is letting it be known
[50:58] it is I that advanced Moses and Aaron
[51:01] they were not even looking for what God
[51:04] had called them to I'll tell you right
[51:06] now you know I look at it many times
[51:08] they're told in many situations
[51:09] sometimes you come across those who are
[51:11] looking for pastors I've just been very
[51:13] honest I said if you got a man that
[51:15] comes in here and he tells you that God
[51:17] has spoke to him and led him to take
[51:20] this church you better run from that guy
[51:22] right there because the reality is that
[51:24] that is not how it works
[51:26] it works when God works he works on bow
[51:30] yNN's when God was dealing with Moses he
[51:33] was dealing with the people at the same
[51:34] time that's how God works God wants to
[51:38] work in unity God does not want
[51:40] resistance God moves in such a manner of
[51:43] unity but to think how then Moses here
[51:45] he was he was out running here was Aaron
[51:48] they were not looking for this but God
[51:50] is the one who advanced it it's God who
[51:53] brought it about you know what is being
[51:55] brutally portrayed here all the way
[51:57] through this chapter of how that Israel
[51:59] would get in trouble and then God step
[52:02] on the scene when they repented and God
[52:04] would send to them saviors God would
[52:07] send to them those whom he had made
[52:10] himself known to them that they would
[52:13] lead them into battle you see God's
[52:15] people are not without leadership amen
[52:19] and God's leadership of the Holy Ghost
[52:21] is not something just like a loose
[52:23] cannon that's out here
[52:25] he works within a divine order God will
[52:28] never leave the order of his word never
[52:32] will he leave the order of his word so
[52:35] they think of how that Samuel here is
[52:37] the grace of God where that here God
[52:40] would even let them know that that I've
[52:43] been the one who has stood for you again
[52:46] and again I'm the one who has provided
[52:49] for you you see they've already heard
[52:51] this even in previous chapters but he's
[52:53] letting them know it again you would
[52:55] think that after this time that they
[52:58] would say wait a minute here there has
[53:00] been three services like this but
[53:03] instead it passed him right on by there
[53:05] was no connection with what was taking
[53:08] place oh god help us amen help us help
[53:14] you help me but not just set and dis
[53:16] hear things but hearing in a matter of
[53:18] deflection but let us hear it you know
[53:21] this is why brother man said in sudden
[53:23] secret going away from the church he
[53:25] said to get ready he said I've got to
[53:27] get myself ready and you've got to get
[53:29] yourself ready he said I can't be
[53:31] worrying about you and you can't be
[53:33] worrying about me he said you've got to
[53:35] take care of your
[53:36] Oh life glory be to God
[53:40] now to think of this here here look at
[53:42] look at this how that this is picked up
[53:44] here and you wonder within it that all
[53:48] of a sudden that this this request is
[53:51] made about a king and you find that in
[53:54] the midst here of verse 12 of 1st Samuel
[53:58] 12 the Bible says here when ye saw
[54:03] nay - what a name
[54:06] it means serpent when you saw that
[54:10] serpent the king of the children of Amon
[54:15] come out against you
[54:17] you said unto me may but a king shall
[54:21] reign over us when the Lord your God was
[54:26] your king Israel looks at an
[54:31] encroachment even in even in chapter 11
[54:33] this is even beyond what we just read in
[54:35] chapter 10 but here there obviously was
[54:37] an encroachment of Nass even before what
[54:40] we actually begin to see in verse 11 -
[54:43] where that the people themselves
[54:45] remembered they're looking at how that
[54:47] the other nations are led out by a king
[54:50] but what they failed to recognize is
[54:52] that the Lord was king over them that
[54:55] the Lord was the one who was leading
[54:57] them in battle you know God's promise
[54:59] was even back there in Exodus 15 of what
[55:03] had taken place at the Red Sea God even
[55:05] said by that mighty act he said with
[55:07] this right here I will close the dukes
[55:10] of Edom to be amazed I will cause fear
[55:12] to come upon the people in the land in
[55:15] Exodus 23 God went on to say about the
[55:18] angel that I have set before thee to
[55:20] keep thee in the way and bring them to
[55:22] the place that I prepared for thee
[55:24] you know God said in that in that same
[55:26] place if you obey my voice
[55:28] you'll heed my word then I will be an
[55:30] adversary to your adversaries I'll be an
[55:33] enemy to your enemies oh my you see what
[55:37] a precious reality it is to be under the
[55:40] leadership of the Holy Ghost sure we
[55:43] have test sure we have try
[55:45] sure we have obstacles that come our way
[55:47] but you know what those obstacles do
[55:49] they only prove and give God
[55:52] opportunities they are platforms that
[55:54] God Himself can step forward and make
[55:57] himself known in our lives I tell you
[56:00] friends I just don't want to read about
[56:02] God that ain't going to get us in a
[56:06] rapture it takes a living God that same
[56:09] God he stood there night after night on
[56:12] the platform that same God that
[56:14] delivered that word that same God
[56:16] working among his people and in our
[56:18] lives
[56:19] it takes that same God moving in a lot
[56:22] no wonder brother Bev said you give me a
[56:23] church he said that is exercise to
[56:26] believe in miracles that are exercised
[56:29] to believe in the word he said I'll show
[56:31] you a church that the rapture will not
[56:34] be a hard thing for her because the
[56:37] rapture is not our efforts what a sad
[56:47] sad sad case here
[56:50] you said unto me a king shall reign over
[56:52] us when the Lord your God was your king
[56:57] now therefore behold the king whom ye
[57:02] have chosen and whom you desired well I
[57:07] thought God chose him
[57:09] God did choose him but God chose him
[57:12] based on what they wanted
[57:14] you see when they didn't no longer want
[57:17] to heed and walk under the word and
[57:19] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[57:21] then God said I'll give you what you
[57:23] want but yet he pleaded with them you
[57:25] realized when God was pleading with them
[57:27] right here through Samuel they could
[57:30] have at that time said you know what I'm
[57:32] wrong I don't know what I was thinking
[57:35] about I'm wrong I'm wrong but they
[57:40] weren't even moved in that way and
[57:41] matter of fact they have even said the
[57:43] opposite nay we want our King Oh God
[57:49] now therefore the King whom you have
[57:51] chosen and whom you desired and behold
[57:54] the Lord hath set a king over you if you
[57:58] will
[57:58] fear the Lord and serve him and obey his
[58:01] voice and not rebelled against the
[58:03] commandment of the Lord then shall both
[58:05] ye and also the king that reigneth over
[58:08] you continue following the Lord your God
[58:10] but if he will not if you will not obey
[58:13] the voice of the Lord but rebelled
[58:16] against the commandment of the Lord then
[58:18] shall the hand of the Lord be against
[58:21] you as it was against your father's God
[58:26] don't make anybody serving God don't
[58:29] have no respect to persons it's very
[58:33] clear when we look even at Israel how
[58:35] that God let it be known if you obey me
[58:38] and follow me and heed to my
[58:41] Commandments heed to my word I'll be
[58:44] that enemy to you minimus I'll be the
[58:47] adversary to your adversaries I'll be on
[58:52] your side because you're on mine one
[58:56] thing that I want you to notice I know
[58:57] it's the obvious sometimes it's the
[59:00] obvious that's overlooked but there's
[59:04] one thing that's obvious in all these
[59:06] scriptures that we've read here over the
[59:08] past weeks they never once sought the
[59:11] Lord they never asked Samuel Samuel what
[59:18] do you think about this you see even
[59:23] though maybe services had continued they
[59:27] had heard Samuel and maybe it went on
[59:29] but they were not under the headship of
[59:32] the word it actually presented itself in
[59:35] a manner to where they didn't even seek
[59:38] God's advice home I wonder what they
[59:42] were resting on what were they relying
[59:45] on where were they resting were they
[59:48] resting upon some sensation were they
[59:51] resting upon a previous scripture well
[59:53] you know we're God's covenant people all
[59:55] of that is true
[59:57] all of that is true but all of that in
[1:00:01] its proper place
[1:00:04] they didn't even ask called they didn't
[1:00:06] even and when all the burdens went when
[1:00:09] even the enemy when they asked and the
[1:00:11] rest of them were coming up around them
[1:00:13] they didn't even send in a prayer
[1:00:14] request they didn't even lift it up and
[1:00:16] say hey I don't know what's going on
[1:00:18] here but we need help they were
[1:00:21] surrounded even in the midst of a
[1:00:24] temptation they did not even ask for
[1:00:27] prayer and say Lord we need help
[1:00:30] or friends don't ever let us get to a
[1:00:34] place of pride where it's so built upon
[1:00:38] who we believe that we are to where we
[1:00:41] fail to look to God to recognize every
[1:00:45] day we need him every moment we need him
[1:00:48] do you realize the spirit the climax of
[1:00:51] this spirit that began back there in
[1:00:54] that day on in that first church age and
[1:00:56] how that it leads into this time right
[1:00:58] here to where that in this age you've
[1:01:01] got the spirit where it raised us to a
[1:01:03] place where that of the a man the Holy
[1:01:06] Ghost is here among us and then you got
[1:01:08] the same spirit that says I don't have
[1:01:10] need of nothing you know to think of it
[1:01:17] we can have all the word and yet have
[1:01:21] nothing if we don't have him we missed
[1:01:26] everything because he's the one that
[1:01:29] gives life to this word without him this
[1:01:33] word is a dead letter it will help our
[1:01:36] lives how would we give heed to it it'll
[1:01:39] strengthen us but translation we must
[1:01:42] have that of the Holy Ghost to lead and
[1:01:45] guide and direct us in every moment let
[1:01:48] us not walk by just our own thinking of
[1:01:51] things or let us not walk just by little
[1:01:53] things that we see and say well I think
[1:01:55] this might be God's will you be sure
[1:01:58] it's God's will and if God doesn't
[1:02:01] confirm it then wait on the Lord we're
[1:02:07] living in a time you need to make sure
[1:02:09] you know where your footsteps are
[1:02:11] lenient
[1:02:14] they never asked God Lord helped me with
[1:02:17] my burdens you know God told him he told
[1:02:23] him as I read here in the previous
[1:02:25] scripture he told him the manner of the
[1:02:28] kingdom
[1:02:28] you know God not only totaled the manner
[1:02:30] of the kingdom God also had told him and
[1:02:32] told him in a previous chapter that one
[1:02:35] day you're going to cry out because of
[1:02:38] the king that you have chosen right
[1:02:41] being it didn't look like it but he said
[1:02:43] one day you're gonna cry out you you see
[1:02:46] what we find here is that God is
[1:02:49] faithful God allows us to make our own
[1:02:52] decisions and our own choices he allows
[1:02:57] it he permits that but God also says
[1:03:00] whatever the repercussions are I won't
[1:03:02] remove it but then again whatever the
[1:03:06] rewards are I won't remove them either
[1:03:08] those decisions and choices that we
[1:03:12] always have before us sometimes I know
[1:03:15] we take the scripture that you know and
[1:03:17] it's true whatsoever a man soweth that
[1:03:19] shall he also reap that is true and if a
[1:03:22] man souls bad he's gonna reap bad but if
[1:03:24] a man shows good he's gonna reap good
[1:03:27] sometimes the sowing that's going forth
[1:03:30] is not always evident in the generation
[1:03:34] and the time but it becomes known later
[1:03:37] on you with me now Paul himself we was
[1:03:40] not alive when that first church age
[1:03:42] started but the seeds that were sown it
[1:03:44] went forth and there was crop and moved
[1:03:47] all the way down down through time to
[1:03:49] where you and I are now and to think of
[1:03:51] it even in this hour where God has taken
[1:03:54] the messenger off the scene but yet the
[1:03:55] seed that had been sown that seed of the
[1:03:58] world that supernatural reality of the
[1:04:01] Living God
[1:04:01] you realize friends here we are standing
[1:04:03] here years and years later some 54 years
[1:04:07] later but you know what God is still the
[1:04:10] same God as a matter of fact he's
[1:04:11] greater now than he was then not because
[1:04:15] of people but brother man tells us over
[1:04:18] and over from the early parts of the
[1:04:19] later part he said this gospel it will
[1:04:22] be taken in a more powerful way he goes
[1:04:24] on to tell us I believe it's 1959 the
[1:04:27] reason of that is because we are coming
[1:04:29] closer and closer to the coming of the
[1:04:32] Lord it's not about you around its God
[1:04:35] fulfilling its word in his season God
[1:04:38] did not remove his power and then he
[1:04:41] expects us to get through puttering
[1:04:43] along that's not so at all God's
[1:04:45] demonstrated manifested power that was
[1:04:48] here before us it was to manifest
[1:04:50] himself as the Living God that our faith
[1:04:53] would be so divinely placed within that
[1:04:56] word in a perfect faith and the power of
[1:04:59] God to move behind it and make it live
[1:05:01] in our life you're not going to tell me
[1:05:04] that God took away the power God would
[1:05:09] be working contrary to his program the
[1:05:13] gift and that of a prophet yeah God took
[1:05:15] that away because what was needed to be
[1:05:18] done had been done had been done the
[1:05:23] seventh angel had finished his course oh
[1:05:26] my now think of this here God gave
[1:05:30] Israel the desire via their heart and
[1:05:33] you think of this of how they you know
[1:05:36] when you look at it so often you know we
[1:05:39] we quote and say God will give you the
[1:05:43] desire of your heart and that's true
[1:05:46] this is where brother Branham would tell
[1:05:48] us and does God change his mind about
[1:05:50] his word he said you'd be careful what
[1:05:53] your desire is because he said God will
[1:05:57] give you the desire of your heart be
[1:06:01] careful that desire because he said he
[1:06:03] promised to give you the desire of your
[1:06:04] heart and let your desire be the word of
[1:06:08] God let your desire be his will never
[1:06:12] your own will his will if you ask him
[1:06:16] for something and he don't give it you
[1:06:19] say thank you Lord you know what's good
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:25] because there are things that we might
[1:06:28] desire
[1:06:31] I'm not talking about sinful things
[1:06:34] those things that we can desire that
[1:06:37] would be godly but it all comes in time
[1:06:40] and season it is not to be manipulated
[1:06:44] and ordered by the hands of man it's to
[1:06:48] be ordered by God himself but desires
[1:06:52] desires ho God let our desires be to his
[1:06:56] word sometimes it's not it's not that
[1:06:58] the desire itself is wrong as we've
[1:07:00] looked at it sometimes it's the wrong
[1:07:02] season it's the wrong time it's the
[1:07:06] wrong way everything becomes God's
[1:07:10] provided way God's channel in God's time
[1:07:15] decisions and choices they have rewards
[1:07:18] they have consequences sometimes
[1:07:22] constant choices that we make we repo
[1:07:31] sometimes the choices that we make
[1:07:33] we don't just reap them for a day for an
[1:07:37] hour for weeks months sometimes as
[1:07:40] choices we reap for the rest of our
[1:07:43] lives let's give an example here I don't
[1:07:49] even have to go in very far but think of
[1:07:51] brother Branham himself the choice that
[1:07:55] he made his mother-in-law never forced
[1:07:58] him he made that choice you find over
[1:08:04] and over were the choice the hardness I
[1:08:07] can't even imagine it can't even imagine
[1:08:10] it but do you realize even after he's
[1:08:13] been married and with children here he
[1:08:15] stands there in Christ the mystery of
[1:08:17] God revealed opening and that mystery in
[1:08:19] were in that service and he makes the
[1:08:21] statement he says you know what he said
[1:08:24] every time I come back here God God God
[1:08:28] makes it hard on me and he said I
[1:08:35] believe what that is is because I failed
[1:08:37] to go
[1:08:40] you mean God would allow that to be you
[1:08:43] mean God would not remove every scar
[1:08:46] from a life you mean God would not
[1:08:48] remove all the consequences no because
[1:08:52] there's certain times and certain things
[1:08:54] that God loves to make His grace no you
[1:09:00] think about it if anybody could have
[1:09:01] crumbled
[1:09:02] he could have crumbled in that hour and
[1:09:04] matter of fact the flesh man the spirit
[1:09:07] man William Branham crumbled it was
[1:09:10] ready even when he stood there beside
[1:09:12] his little girl he said I was ready to
[1:09:15] say but he said to think if that typos
[1:09:22] hadn't been there he didn't defeat the
[1:09:27] devil with doctrine that day the devil
[1:09:30] he backed up with doctrine the devil is
[1:09:32] backed up with the Living expression and
[1:09:35] divine revelation of Jesus Christ that's
[1:09:38] anchored in the heart of the believer
[1:09:40] this world is not dying for doctrine
[1:09:43] this world is dying for the revelation
[1:09:45] of Jesus Christ
[1:09:47] doctrine does not convert Souls doctrine
[1:09:51] is the bark that comes on the tree after
[1:09:54] life has now went through it sometimes
[1:09:58] it's things so backwards where people
[1:10:00] have become so educated
[1:10:02] they've got barked but no life bars and
[1:10:07] no life barked but they bite rewards
[1:10:14] there are rewards for right choices
[1:10:17] there are consequences and to think of
[1:10:21] it Oh God you know friends even when you
[1:10:24] and I have made the wrong decisions
[1:10:29] because we have we've made decisions
[1:10:34] that were wrong sometimes you realize
[1:10:39] that right when you make it other times
[1:10:41] you recognize it down the road are you
[1:10:46] but see God in His grace if our heart
[1:10:50] stays with that desire Lord I want to be
[1:10:52] in tune with you then God will bring
[1:10:55] back what has when his permissive will
[1:10:59] he'll bring it right back in line to his
[1:11:02] perfect will but it won't be us it'll do
[1:11:05] it it'll be him because you and I as we
[1:11:09] came by the permissive will of God in
[1:11:11] this first birth remember it had to be
[1:11:14] him come by a virgin birth to now come
[1:11:17] to bring back that bringing us and
[1:11:18] leading us back into the perfect will of
[1:11:21] God
[1:11:21] I'm so glad about that aren't you I'm
[1:11:23] grateful for God's mercy to come and to
[1:11:26] deal with our lives to think of this of
[1:11:29] how that you know within that permissive
[1:11:31] will of God there's times as I said we
[1:11:33] can learn from it you know you think of
[1:11:35] how that brother branham learned from
[1:11:36] them when he went over to to Africa
[1:11:38] there that time brother BAM learned from
[1:11:40] it what did brother Graham learned he
[1:11:41] learned that I'm not gonna let Minister
[1:11:43] set my itinerary right
[1:11:46] even though brother Branham protested it
[1:11:49] and said no we shouldn't go this way but
[1:11:53] he was kind of trapped right he was kind
[1:11:57] of trapped but notice how that God moved
[1:12:01] in it didn't mean that notice that
[1:12:02] didn't mean that he wasn't going to
[1:12:03] suffer for it he did suffer for it
[1:12:06] he suffered for over six months with
[1:12:09] that amoeba but you know God was
[1:12:12] faithful to his word sometimes we we
[1:12:15] look at things you know and God has a
[1:12:18] way about instructing you and I and
[1:12:20] teaching you and I you know we can look
[1:12:22] at that you know
[1:12:23] we could point that out and you know we
[1:12:24] could have sat down you know the brother
[1:12:26] banura we could have been there you know
[1:12:27] and you know you're trying to a brother
[1:12:29] Ram you got this for me but here's why
[1:12:30] you got this amoeba
[1:12:31] you got this amoeba because of this and
[1:12:32] this and this and this and this and this
[1:12:34] that don't do nobody a bit of good the
[1:12:37] reality God permitted this because of
[1:12:41] his choice but when a heart is sensitive
[1:12:45] to God God will come and teach us even
[1:12:49] from that moment he will teach us four
[1:12:54] things that will come later in life
[1:12:56] so even those
[1:12:58] decisions and choices that have been
[1:13:01] wrong decisions and choices if we'll
[1:13:03] learn it and put it into his hands he
[1:13:05] but he said he makes all things work
[1:13:08] together for our good nothing everything
[1:13:11] is good but he'll make it work for good
[1:13:13] see this is where you want to just allow
[1:13:16] the Lord and I broad to minister there
[1:13:19] into your life with things that you know
[1:13:21] that you can see allow His grace to move
[1:13:24] down in our life to correcting those
[1:13:26] things maybe it's an attitude about an
[1:13:28] event maybe it's a thought about a
[1:13:29] previous event but if you allow the Holy
[1:13:31] Spirit to come down and just allow him
[1:13:34] to move in your life he will brood and
[1:13:36] brood over your life and bring it to
[1:13:38] that place that he himself desires to
[1:13:40] bring you to in your life Oh mother here
[1:13:47] look here and saw first Samuel 13 let's
[1:13:52] look here for a few moments the Bible
[1:13:59] says in verse 1 Saul reigned one year
[1:14:04] and when he had reigned two years over
[1:14:08] Israel Saul chose him three thousand men
[1:14:11] of Israel where of two thousand were
[1:14:14] with Saul in mcNeish and in Mount Bethel
[1:14:17] and a thousand were with Jonathan Gabala
[1:14:21] of Benjamin and the rest of the people
[1:14:23] he sent every man to his tent and
[1:14:26] Jonathan smoked the garrison of the
[1:14:29] Philistines that was in gaiba
[1:14:31] and the Philistines heard of it and Saul
[1:14:36] blew the trumpet throughout all the land
[1:14:38] saying let the Hebrews hear you know I
[1:14:43] think when you we read this here in the
[1:14:46] scripture brother branham you know he'll
[1:14:50] he'll take up on this particular verse
[1:14:51] and you run his quarterback into he into
[1:14:54] chapter 11 as well but just see how that
[1:14:58] Saul himself
[1:15:00] after a battle has been won and it was
[1:15:03] Jonathan that won the battle as a matter
[1:15:06] of fact even in other chapters it's
[1:15:08] Jonathan winning battles
[1:15:11] that's really that's really who's been
[1:15:13] winning the battles and you found some
[1:15:15] really interesting parts about Jonathan
[1:15:18] in his life but you look how thats all
[1:15:20] here he sounds a trumpet and you know
[1:15:23] brother branham said it like this he
[1:15:25] said how did God you know had moved
[1:15:28] there and he said then you find house
[1:15:30] all he sounds a trumpet and he says with
[1:15:33] that trumpet you see what saul has done
[1:15:37] he begin to get puffed up you remember
[1:15:42] there's three things rubra me talks
[1:15:46] about you know with with that of the
[1:15:47] ministry has to watch popularity money
[1:15:50] women and he vine was saul soul is
[1:15:55] always linked to this of popularity to
[1:15:59] that of pride you know when I read about
[1:16:02] saw as a man that I feel sorry for I
[1:16:05] know that I know that he made it but I
[1:16:09] feel sorry for him because he was a man
[1:16:12] that got put in position by people
[1:16:16] people that were unhappy people that
[1:16:20] were displeased people that were fearful
[1:16:22] and this man got forced into a position
[1:16:25] that was not for him that's a sad thing
[1:16:33] God doesn't need to force anything God
[1:16:37] places God places he don't have to force
[1:16:41] nothing and look out it's all here in
[1:16:45] the midst of it he he rises within this
[1:16:48] time and pride itself has rose to a
[1:16:50] place look what I have done you remember
[1:16:53] in a previous chapter here think of this
[1:16:55] of how that you know when you look at
[1:16:57] how that God would so set up that of a
[1:17:00] king now when you know when we look
[1:17:02] ahead you know when you think of how
[1:17:04] that God does it with that of job of
[1:17:07] Joshua well then you even look ahead to
[1:17:08] David in comparing it to this right here
[1:17:10] when you look even ahead to that time
[1:17:12] the Bible talks about how then men
[1:17:15] themselves gathered themselves to David
[1:17:18] you don't read about how
[1:17:19] but David was having to assemble people
[1:17:22] but it was were God himself that night
[1:17:25] Matt have been so anointed by God - God
[1:17:28] brought the Assembly around that gift
[1:17:31] that he had anointed him that life but
[1:17:33] you don't find that was so you find Saul
[1:17:37] he's got to blow the trumpet he's got to
[1:17:42] sound the trumpet he's gathering people
[1:17:46] unto himself now watch how he does it
[1:17:50] the Bible says in bins in believe it's
[1:17:52] first samuel 11 6 somewhere in there it
[1:17:54] speaks of how that here that saul at
[1:17:57] that time the bible says that when he he
[1:17:59] took an oxen and he any viewed it and he
[1:18:02] used that oxen in two pieces and he
[1:18:05] scented by the hands of messengers and
[1:18:07] he said whosoever cometh not forth after
[1:18:10] soul and after Samuel whoa that is a
[1:18:14] mistake right there after Saul and after
[1:18:20] Samuel it should have been after Samuel
[1:18:24] and after Saul even the order is wrong
[1:18:31] but notice what he's doing he's got to
[1:18:34] get a following he's got to get people
[1:18:38] to him now how can he get people to him
[1:18:41] how can he draw people to himself he's
[1:18:45] the king
[1:18:46] he's been anointed king it ought to be
[1:18:48] that the people would just be drawn
[1:18:50] there and placed by God but a hidden so
[1:18:58] shall it be done unto his oxen and the
[1:19:02] fear of the Lord fell on the people and
[1:19:05] they came out with one consent look at
[1:19:09] that the fear of the Lord came on the
[1:19:13] people why because the people feared
[1:19:16] Samuel he's using this leverage to draw
[1:19:22] people unto himself you know it's the
[1:19:25] same way that the word the way the word
[1:19:27] the way the message anything it can be
[1:19:29] used in a place but listen when it is
[1:19:32] Fuli drawn the battle god it is not
[1:19:34] drawing to that of a church he does not
[1:19:37] draw you to a personality listen to me
[1:19:39] now
[1:19:39] it does not even draw you in fear it
[1:19:42] draws you by divine love when anything
[1:19:46] itself draws people together by fear
[1:19:49] that it's not of God it's none of God
[1:19:54] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:19:57] wisdom but remember the fear of the Lord
[1:20:00] it's trusting God our confidence is in
[1:20:05] him our confidence it's not a man but
[1:20:08] our confidence is in the Lord and to
[1:20:11] think of how that this would be drawn
[1:20:13] you know brother Ram would put it like
[1:20:14] this he said of how that this fear that
[1:20:17] would come upon you know the people
[1:20:18] because of Samuel and he deals with it
[1:20:21] in a stance he says you know the Holy
[1:20:23] Spirit is our judge behold the Holy
[1:20:26] Spirit he said not a Pope not a bishop
[1:20:28] or anybody to be a judge the Holy Spirit
[1:20:31] the person of God in the form of the
[1:20:33] Holy Spirit is our judge and our guide
[1:20:36] and yet within this the people would
[1:20:40] they would feel a sense of relief well
[1:20:43] hell you know if Samuels attach to it it
[1:20:45] must be alright but Samuel never told
[1:20:49] him to do this you find one thing that's
[1:20:54] present within Saul's life over and over
[1:20:57] he doesn't he doesn't and has not even
[1:21:01] to this place sought for the will of God
[1:21:05] never
[1:21:06] he's never sought for it you never find
[1:21:11] in any of the scriptures right here that
[1:21:13] we've read up to Betty ever called for
[1:21:15] the e fund where he ever called for the
[1:21:18] priest up to this point
[1:21:19] never what a dangerous place a dangerous
[1:21:30] place to feel as though he's got
[1:21:33] everything together we've got everything
[1:21:37] together
[1:21:38] they don't need to Ascot I don't need to
[1:21:42] ask God about this you see Saul had more
[1:21:46] listen to me now Saul had more
[1:21:48] confidence in his position I hope you
[1:21:55] with me
[1:21:56] he had more confidence in his position
[1:21:58] it's the same way whether it be King
[1:22:00] whether they pastor whether it be
[1:22:02] prophet whether it be husband whether it
[1:22:04] be wife whether it be deacon whether it
[1:22:05] be trustee on and on and on you can have
[1:22:08] confidence and your position and you
[1:22:11] operate simply because this is my
[1:22:14] position this is what's said to be done
[1:22:18] right here and you operate just by
[1:22:21] position if it's not by the unction of
[1:22:25] the Holy Ghost
[1:22:26] it's not even received as husbands wives
[1:22:31] dads moms pastor on and on and on we
[1:22:36] need his leadership we needed every step
[1:22:43] of the way
[1:22:43] we need his divine direction and God
[1:22:47] does not want things associated by fear
[1:22:49] even in that of our home God does not
[1:22:51] want our homes to be run by fear he does
[1:22:55] not want to church to be run by fear
[1:22:58] fear produces instability in people's
[1:23:02] lives
[1:23:03] divine love will take where fear is and
[1:23:07] divine love will actually cast out fear
[1:23:10] because the love of God is a sanctifying
[1:23:13] and cleansing love that is actually able
[1:23:16] to take even your own demeaning thoughts
[1:23:19] about yourself and the washing of water
[1:23:22] by the word is able to wash you and lift
[1:23:25] you in divine grace in what God says
[1:23:28] about your life God doesn't want nobody
[1:23:31] following him because of fear you know
[1:23:35] why because the first situation you run
[1:23:39] it doesn't want anybody by fear I don't
[1:23:42] want anybody come in this church by fear
[1:23:43] I don't people to fear me I want them to
[1:23:48] fear the Lord who stands behind it to
[1:23:50] respect that
[1:23:52] absolutely because that's where they're
[1:23:54] so but I don't want people to fear well
[1:23:57] well brother sending no it's fear the
[1:23:58] Lord not brother Samuel it's fear the
[1:24:01] Lord because he is always with us
[1:24:07] he's the one who's watching over it you
[1:24:09] see it don't matter with you you look at
[1:24:11] it you can come to church
[1:24:13] day after day or service after service
[1:24:15] and you look at how but the scripture
[1:24:17] would be a place right here that brother
[1:24:19] man tells us he said what they were
[1:24:21] warning here he said when they seem that
[1:24:23] join their they wanted just enough to
[1:24:26] say well God is with us but they want
[1:24:28] you to live how they want to live they
[1:24:30] want to do how they want to do I'll tell
[1:24:32] you we want to live how God desires us
[1:24:35] to live we want to walk according that
[1:24:37] word you know that's God's grace that
[1:24:39] God would open his pattern to you and I
[1:24:42] God would let you and I know what's
[1:24:44] acceptable in our lives
[1:24:46] that's God's grace His grace and His
[1:24:51] mercy he don't want to be just the judge
[1:24:54] just the one who is here when we're here
[1:24:56] one day out of the week or two days out
[1:24:58] of the week he wants to be with us day
[1:25:01] by day
[1:25:02] no overshadowing our life he's higher
[1:25:05] protection day by the moment after a
[1:25:08] moment he's the one who is our guide my
[1:25:18] look at this result the Bible says verse
[1:25:23] four I'm coming down and all Israel
[1:25:28] heard say that Saul had smitten a
[1:25:31] garrison of the Philistines and that
[1:25:34] Israel also was had an abomination with
[1:25:36] the Philistines and the people were
[1:25:38] called together after Saul to gilga and
[1:25:41] the Philistines gathered themselves
[1:25:43] together to fight with Israel thirty
[1:25:45] thousand chariots and six thousand
[1:25:47] horsemen people as the sand which is on
[1:25:49] the seashore in multitude and they came
[1:25:52] up
[1:25:53] and pitched in McMath eastward from
[1:25:57] behavin Beth even when the men of Israel
[1:26:02] saw that they were in a straight for the
[1:26:07] people were distressed then the people
[1:26:11] did hide themselves in caves and in
[1:26:14] thickets and in rocks and in high places
[1:26:16] and in tents and some of the Hebrews
[1:26:20] went over Jordan to the land of GAD and
[1:26:23] Gilead as for Saul he was yet in gilga
[1:26:26] and all the people followed him
[1:26:28] trembling
[1:26:35] this is the result of a lack of headship
[1:26:42] the people are in fear here the enemy is
[1:26:47] approaching its fearful everything is
[1:26:50] fear all around I tell you your life is
[1:26:55] not meant to be ruled by fear the same
[1:27:02] I'm afraid I'll be deceived even that
[1:27:03] fear is evil we have a promise in the
[1:27:08] word but then says if you're afraid of
[1:27:12] that he said look up look up we have
[1:27:17] that promise God is faithful he will not
[1:27:21] allow us to be deceived if we're
[1:27:25] standing in him God will not allow that
[1:27:28] it is not God's will to operate with
[1:27:32] fear when you gotta watch out for this
[1:27:36] you gotta look out for that you gotta
[1:27:38] watch out for this you've got to look
[1:27:40] out for that you've got to watch out for
[1:27:42] this well tell me what I can look for
[1:27:45] well but I don't know about what you can
[1:27:47] look for but you know I know what you
[1:27:49] need to you know you need it wrong thing
[1:27:52] it's fear hiding in caves hiding you
[1:27:57] know people look at these people
[1:27:59] then this should have been where they
[1:28:01] are uniting together instead of uniting
[1:28:03] together they're drawn off they're
[1:28:05] getting in caves they're getting in
[1:28:07] heels this very much looks like what
[1:28:09] takes place in the Book of Revelations
[1:28:11] when he comes there and stands before
[1:28:12] preparing for Armageddon hide us from
[1:28:16] the face of the lab here they should
[1:28:18] have been a time but you realize this is
[1:28:21] what the wrong leadership and wrong
[1:28:24] headship what it produces when
[1:28:27] everything even when things themselves
[1:28:29] it has to operate within the right order
[1:28:32] and the right boundaries if it doesn't
[1:28:34] it produces instability this is why
[1:28:37] there must be stability in lives that
[1:28:41] stability of the Holy Ghost within a
[1:28:44] life where a man and
[1:28:45] it's planet in the Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:28:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:28:50] plants you and I in the world and while
[1:28:53] lives are established in God the same
[1:29:02] fear it's a same fear that came in on
[1:29:06] that first couple there in the Garden of
[1:29:09] Eden God made it clear in the book of
[1:29:14] Deuteronomy we read from the leadership
[1:29:19] that of the the king is to be under the
[1:29:22] word of the Lord
[1:29:26] he might have five Baker's this one has
[1:29:28] ten Baker's but he's is to be under the
[1:29:31] word of the Lord he's to seek after the
[1:29:36] will of God his heart is not to be like
[1:29:40] that of the heart of a king so much as
[1:29:41] the heart of a servant you'll find over
[1:29:45] and over and over in David's life
[1:29:49] Lord thou art my king David was King but
[1:29:54] he said Lord you're my king he put
[1:29:57] himself under the Lord
[1:30:12] you find
[1:30:15] for Samuel 10/8 this is just let me just
[1:30:19] refer to this point here God had told
[1:30:26] Saul through Samuel these were orders
[1:30:31] thou shalt go down before me to gilga
[1:30:35] and behold I will come down unto thee to
[1:30:38] offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice
[1:30:40] sacrifice --is of peace offerings seven
[1:30:43] days shalt thou tarry till I come to
[1:30:46] thee and show thee what thou shalt do
[1:30:55] you see we look at this as it opens
[1:30:59] resuming there and that and that chapter
[1:31:01] remember Samuel himself in likened to
[1:31:05] that of the Holy Spirit God's mouthpiece
[1:31:07] here Terry seven days and when I come
[1:31:13] I'll show you what you should do
[1:31:17] was it that Saul didn't know how to
[1:31:19] offer up the offering he did he knew how
[1:31:24] to do it precisely but he wasn't called
[1:31:27] for that didn't know how matter how much
[1:31:31] he knew he wasn't called for it but here
[1:31:35] is a test that has given him wait wait
[1:31:42] can you wait sometimes that's the
[1:31:49] hardest thing to do because our first
[1:31:55] nature is one that is probe that is a
[1:32:01] given it can be given to fear
[1:32:04] anxiousness pressure all sorts of things
[1:32:10] that can come up around us pressures
[1:32:16] even in things to where you can have
[1:32:19] scriptures quoted to you quotes quoted
[1:32:23] to you come on somebody to where it
[1:32:29] would operate and try to operate within
[1:32:32] pressure let me tell you something if
[1:32:33] Satan knew the plan of God regarding
[1:32:37] this about King then Satan he can also
[1:32:41] look at things about our lives and
[1:32:44] safety knows if our desire friends if
[1:32:49] our desire is to please God more than
[1:32:52] anything else in the world you know this
[1:32:55] is where you've got to discern every
[1:32:57] spirit amen the Bible didn't say every
[1:33:02] word has said every spirit because
[1:33:05] sometimes the word it can seem like it's
[1:33:07] right on
[1:33:08] but it's the spirit it's the spirit
[1:33:12] discerned try every spirit see if it be
[1:33:17] of God that's why I'm brother Ram will
[1:33:19] tell us in discernment of spirit he said
[1:33:21] you can see this man he said but why
[1:33:23] don't he said you look and say tried to
[1:33:26] discern the heart he said discern from
[1:33:28] his heart what he's trying to achieve
[1:33:30] for the program of God both how we need
[1:33:35] we need that discernment we need that
[1:33:38] leadership when we stand in times in her
[1:33:40] home stand in times to the church we
[1:33:43] need that leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:33:45] do realize even at times when there's
[1:33:48] things that takes place even within
[1:33:50] family sometimes we feel the pressures
[1:33:53] and whatever more you might want to do
[1:33:54] this and maybe you should do this and
[1:33:56] maybe you should do that but friends all
[1:33:58] of those things that ought to be hold
[1:34:00] just a moment
[1:34:01] let's pray let's pray let's stop all the
[1:34:07] debating and reasoning and hashing and
[1:34:09] building bridges and this and that that
[1:34:12] ain't getting nowhere let's pray let's
[1:34:17] seek the mind of God because if we're
[1:34:19] not careful we'll bit it we'll build a
[1:34:21] bridge that seven feet tall
[1:34:25] ends up being a salt you with me ends up
[1:34:30] being a song something that pressures
[1:34:33] that's under you know and we all feel
[1:34:34] that we fill it as husband's we fill in
[1:34:36] his wives I feel there's a pastor you
[1:34:38] can feel all the sorts way you want to
[1:34:40] do this you want to do this you want to
[1:34:41] do this under that but the thing that I
[1:34:42] have to wait on is and you have to do
[1:34:44] the same thing we must wait on the Lord
[1:34:48] it's not just this is black and white
[1:34:50] gets wait on the Lord
[1:35:07] bible says in verse 8
[1:35:12] he tarried seven days according to the
[1:35:16] set time that Samuel had appointed but
[1:35:21] Samuel came not to gilga and the people
[1:35:25] were scattered from him and Saul said
[1:35:31] bring hither a burnt offering to me and
[1:35:35] peace offerings and he offered a burnt
[1:35:43] offering notice he offered a burnt
[1:35:47] offering
[1:35:53] and it came to pass that as soon as he
[1:35:58] had made and on an end of offering the
[1:36:03] burnt offering behold Samuel came
[1:36:09] and Saul went out to meet him that he
[1:36:13] might salute him and Samuel said what
[1:36:17] hast thou done Saul said because I saw
[1:36:26] that the people were scattered from me
[1:36:30] so who was the offering about who was
[1:36:37] the offering about him it had nothing to
[1:36:42] do with the people it had nothing to do
[1:36:46] with the will of God this was about
[1:36:49] so Oh God
[1:36:55] because I saw that the people were
[1:36:58] scattered from me and that thou came us
[1:37:00] not within the days of Planet
[1:37:03] and that the Philistines gathered
[1:37:04] themselves together and McMath therefore
[1:37:08] said I the Philistines will come down
[1:37:12] now upon me to gilga I have not made
[1:37:16] supplication unto the Lord I forced
[1:37:22] myself therefore and offered
[1:37:32] how sad is that
[1:37:35] this I've forced myself so why did you
[1:37:43] do it well it was the right thing to do
[1:37:45] I should offer a burnt offering I should
[1:37:49] offer peas offerings so you missed the
[1:37:51] key ingredient you didn't wait on the
[1:37:55] Lord
[1:37:57] you've intruded into an office that does
[1:38:02] not belong to you you've walked into a
[1:38:06] place you've presumed you moved into
[1:38:10] adventure because it looks like I see a
[1:38:12] need the need is before us I must do
[1:38:16] this
[1:38:20] but the RAM takes us in the message
[1:38:22] Salone he says you know why don't you
[1:38:26] let your life be like that of David
[1:38:28] referring back to Psalm 62 my time is in
[1:38:33] your hand Lord you hold my future
[1:38:37] he said even regarding he said even
[1:38:40] ministering brothers he said brothers he
[1:38:41] said you know he said you see the need
[1:38:44] of the hour you see the condition of the
[1:38:47] hour he said in sometimes it gets to
[1:38:49] such a place you get impatient
[1:38:55] impatience never produces patience
[1:39:01] impatience never produces peace
[1:39:07] impatience leads to more impatience
[1:39:09] leads to more impatience but if you can
[1:39:13] stop where you've been impatient and say
[1:39:16] Lord forgive me help me to be patient
[1:39:21] help me to wait on you because they that
[1:39:26] wait on the Lord they shall renew their
[1:39:28] strength
[1:39:30] wait on the Lord and be the good
[1:39:32] currants look how this come you know the
[1:39:34] riders even even say like this he said
[1:39:36] the riders say like this they say it
[1:39:38] couldn't have been but even thirty
[1:39:39] minutes of when this saw offering would
[1:39:43] have been consumed let's just say it was
[1:39:44] even an hour but to think of it an hour
[1:39:47] even if it was five minutes or a half an
[1:39:49] hour but everything should have been
[1:39:51] this is what Samuel said he said he
[1:39:55] would be here and I'm not going anywhere
[1:39:59] I'm not doing nothing until he shows up
[1:40:03] Samuel as the Prophet puts it here being
[1:40:06] a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:10] we'll wait and see what he says
[1:40:14] what do you say what do you say Lord you
[1:40:19] see even within this in our life nowhere
[1:40:23] does God want any of us any of you to
[1:40:27] serve Him by force
[1:40:29] it's not his will that you have to force
[1:40:32] yourself to live right you have to force
[1:40:36] yourself to come to church you have to
[1:40:37] force yourself to read force yourself to
[1:40:39] play pray force yourself then that's not
[1:40:42] of God to have to do that you don't
[1:40:44] listen to me it's not God's desire in
[1:40:46] that way but instead look instead of
[1:40:49] trying to take things in your own hands
[1:40:51] well I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do
[1:40:53] that just say Lord you change me Lord
[1:40:57] change my life to match your word let my
[1:41:01] desire Lord let it match your desire
[1:41:04] Lord God you come and deal with my heart
[1:41:06] change my heart let my heart be lined up
[1:41:09] with your heart Lord God when that gets
[1:41:12] going and the hearts get lined up the
[1:41:14] hearts get connected then brother and
[1:41:16] sister it's not a force thing to serve
[1:41:20] God it becomes a privilege it becomes an
[1:41:25] honor it becomes a joy oh it isn't
[1:41:29] sometimes that we don't have to drag
[1:41:30] this carcass here it isn't sometimes
[1:41:33] that we don't have to make it get down
[1:41:34] and pray but what I'm talking about
[1:41:36] is on the inside he is the delight of
[1:41:39] our life there's a power that's moved in
[1:41:42] on the inside we're no longer the same
[1:41:45] people but our desire is to please him
[1:41:48] sometimes look at this even when it came
[1:41:50] to Lazarus there we don't notice here he
[1:41:53] is they sit for Jesus but he's coming
[1:41:56] right on time he's coming right on time
[1:42:00] you see even within that the patience
[1:42:04] jesus said with patience possess your
[1:42:07] souls even in the midst of trials my
[1:42:10] goodness times were we're looking hard
[1:42:14] what Jesus is there an into this
[1:42:17] any better felt like it maybe it's just
[1:42:19] me it's learning into this and it
[1:42:24] crosses your mind but then what raise
[1:42:26] them and said the Lord you've been
[1:42:27] faithful all the way up even to now and
[1:42:30] the way you'll keep on going you've been
[1:42:32] faithful Lord sometimes it seems like
[1:42:35] things itself it just spirals and things
[1:42:38] themselves just coming about but when we
[1:42:40] wait on the Lord there's times oh I'm so
[1:42:42] glad I'm so glad that we would be so
[1:42:45] trained and may we be so trained to wait
[1:42:48] on the great on the Lord Jesus not be
[1:42:51] pressured not be moved
[1:42:54] but wait on God wait on God then you
[1:42:58] know it's called directing it's God
[1:42:59] putting your footsteps down then when
[1:43:01] your footsteps go down it's possession
[1:43:05] that's the value of waiting on the will
[1:43:08] of God then you know you've got
[1:43:10] Authority you've got authority to stand
[1:43:17] before your enemies
[1:43:22] I forced myself
[1:43:29] let's just stop here
[1:43:33] your soul
[1:43:36] I thought about this much over the past
[1:43:40] weeks and things self-will self-will
[1:43:48] Saul was willing all of this willing at
[1:43:52] all about you know the sad part about it
[1:43:56] is is that's the same way that even that
[1:44:00] Cain came and worshiped in the beginning
[1:44:02] it was by self will it was a time to
[1:44:07] worship so he came to worship but Abel
[1:44:11] came to worship by divine revelation
[1:44:15] there was an auction that was directing
[1:44:19] him and leading his life but here solid
[1:44:25] we find one thing that is so it's so
[1:44:29] true that God Himself when we if we
[1:44:36] operate by self will we have to continue
[1:44:40] by self will to try to maintain it
[1:44:45] becomes us maintaining the cause instead
[1:44:50] of the Lord maintaining the cause but if
[1:44:54] we're in his will then it's not us
[1:44:56] maintaining it's him it's him
[1:45:01] it's
[1:45:04] Oh let that be the desire of your heart
[1:45:08] let it be the desire of our life so
[1:45:12] times the waiting it comes right down
[1:45:15] even into the moment comes right down
[1:45:20] sometimes they're very crucial times in
[1:45:22] her life
[1:45:23] we feel pressures you fill them I feel
[1:45:30] but God never has called you and I to
[1:45:33] operate by pressure
[1:45:38] we operate by the will of God
[1:45:41] Lord what's your will on it what's your
[1:45:45] direction on it he's faithful in it so
[1:45:50] good let's pray
[1:45:54] or Jesus
[1:45:58] these are
[1:46:01] sobering sobering points and false the
[1:46:08] Lord we desire Lord from our hearts to
[1:46:12] so reflectable
[1:46:17] or Jesus
[1:46:21] Lord God every every moment within our
[1:46:25] lives Lord we need you I know we say
[1:46:28] that a lot we mean it Lord
[1:46:34] I pray Heavenly Father
[1:46:39] Lord we think of saw I look at it Lord
[1:46:42] my heart just so often Lord I think
[1:46:46] about it it just it breaks
[1:46:50] Sol never he never asked for that
[1:46:55] but it was the people's choice
[1:47:00] pressure Lord that had thrust him out
[1:47:04] into a place that was never ordained
[1:47:15] or God
[1:47:17] in our lives when we look at Saul's life
[1:47:23] or Jesus
[1:47:27] I don't want to just look at things the
[1:47:32] Lord as a pastor as a husband as a
[1:47:35] father throughout the rest of this
[1:47:38] congregation lord those Lord God that
[1:47:45] fulfilling more different attributes
[1:47:47] that you placed offices and so forth our
[1:47:54] desire Lord God
[1:47:57] is to be under your leading sometimes
[1:48:02] the Lord when you lead us well not
[1:48:05] sometimes when you lead us but when you
[1:48:07] lead us Lord
[1:48:10] sometimes it seems like it's slow but
[1:48:16] help us to be comforted in your leading
[1:48:20] not in how fast but that you're leading
[1:48:27] or God sometimes decisions and choices
[1:48:32] and things that we have to make the Lord
[1:48:36] your God help us sort help us Lord that
[1:48:44] we'll defer to you Lord
[1:48:49] help us Lord God I pray not to operate
[1:48:53] by pressures but may we look Lord to you
[1:49:01] may that be the value of our life
[1:49:07] or God how many times order we've been
[1:49:11] right here Lord where Saul is there's
[1:49:15] times no doubt Lord God every one of us
[1:49:17] we've been lured in situations we've
[1:49:21] made decisions sometimes in haste should
[1:49:24] have been more in prayer forgive us Lord
[1:49:29] Jesus help us lord help us to be more
[1:49:37] sensitive help us not to be confident or
[1:49:43] God in our office attribute of our life
[1:49:47] position what God could say like this
[1:49:52] even in our spiritual position as the
[1:49:56] bride of Jesus Christ but may our
[1:50:00] confidence be in unity we must know who
[1:50:05] we are that's true but as your prophet
[1:50:08] told us Lord and why Christ speak
[1:50:10] David's confidence was in the anointing
[1:50:14] of the word that was upon his life
[1:50:19] or Jesus this is our confidence pathways
[1:50:25] the Lord so no doubt Lord throughout the
[1:50:27] building here Lord we could we could
[1:50:29] spend Lord hours in days countlessly we
[1:50:34] could talk about Lord mistakes that
[1:50:36] we've made choices here and there
[1:50:38] sometimes things Lord that we reap scars
[1:50:42] and marks and everything else but yet
[1:50:46] Lord God when we can look and see that
[1:50:51] your grace that has watched over our
[1:50:55] lives Lord even in times where we've
[1:50:59] made decisions that wasn't always along
[1:51:04] your perfect will we even see it as we
[1:51:09] look ahead we see with david many times
[1:51:11] but the difference was David's heart was
[1:51:16] he desired to please you more than
[1:51:20] anything sometimes you'd have to deal
[1:51:24] with David you'd have to crack the
[1:51:25] hardness of the shell to reach that
[1:51:28] heart that inner part that which Lord
[1:51:34] God you choose the Lord you were able to
[1:51:39] make it through to reach David's heart
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:44] Lord Jesus
[1:51:49] sometimes the journeys of life we can
[1:51:53] look at paths of life that have been
[1:51:54] taken that may we look Lord and realize
[1:52:00] may it be Lord that we focus on where
[1:52:03] that you have brought us from sometimes
[1:52:06] Lord there's things about the life it's
[1:52:08] part of the journey the person can ask
[1:52:12] why did I have wanted this decision why
[1:52:14] do I have to go this way why did I make
[1:52:16] the Lord even though it would be a
[1:52:17] decision that they themselves could say
[1:52:19] I know that that was not God's perfect
[1:52:21] will and when they've surrendered it
[1:52:23] lord to you you were able to move down
[1:52:27] and teach him mold shape or to wear that
[1:52:34] Lord God the mistakes the things about
[1:52:36] our life can then stand out as stepping
[1:52:39] stones to one another of your grace Lord
[1:52:44] help us I pray this morning Lord your
[1:52:50] God throughout this building Lord Jesus
[1:52:54] may there not be one Lord if there is
[1:52:59] one Lord this morning then Lord from
[1:53:02] their heart and say I don't want to live
[1:53:06] this kind of a self-will life any longer
[1:53:09] I don't want to force myself I find
[1:53:13] myself a resistance against God's Word I
[1:53:17] want I want the life of that word to
[1:53:24] have a place in me
[1:53:27] I don't want to live where it's forcing
[1:53:30] myself I want to live from my heart to
[1:53:36] serve the Lord but to be someone here
[1:53:40] this morning that would be your desire
[1:53:44] bless you
[1:53:48] bless you maybe one you haven't
[1:53:49] surrendered your heart to God you come
[1:53:54] to church but you know there's more than
[1:53:56] coming to church you know there's more
[1:53:59] to that because that's not a life that's
[1:54:00] not what that's not what God would have
[1:54:02] for you
[1:54:03] he wants to tender your heart he wants
[1:54:06] to soften you he wants to move down and
[1:54:10] draw upon your life maybe in this moment
[1:54:13] you could look at it and say Lord and
[1:54:17] just be honest before him soften me Lord
[1:54:21] soften you know what Jesus I don't want
[1:54:25] to be hard I don't want to have a
[1:54:27] resistant nature Lord but soften me Lord
[1:54:30] God soften me Lord God to your presence
[1:54:36] to your word
