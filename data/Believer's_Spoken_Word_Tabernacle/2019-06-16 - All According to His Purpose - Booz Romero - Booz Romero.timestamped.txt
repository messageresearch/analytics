[44:16] Reacher sister Maria we've been praying
[44:18] for your your granddaughter and I use
[44:21] one I tell you one thing
[44:24] sometimes we ask for a miracle and we
[44:26] say Lord heal her Lord do it do it this
[44:30] way but I have learned one thing and
[44:33] it's like Lord why don't we pray for
[44:36] your perfect wheel it's a little bit
[44:38] different isn't it because we want we
[44:41] want we want a miracle we want we want
[44:43] we want her to be fully recovered but
[44:45] this morning I would like to invite you
[44:47] to pray Lord what is brother Brennan it
[44:50] speaks about it is like sometimes it is
[44:52] just to bring us closer to God amen
[44:57] so whatever situation you're going
[44:59] through this morning it is just to bring
[45:01] you closer to the Lord so that is what
[45:04] we want to speak this morning amen I had
[45:06] something but the Lord said something
[45:08] else so I am I use one a titled is
[45:10] called according to his purpose this
[45:13] morning we are called according to his
[45:15] purpose Amen so if I if I can start this
[45:19] with this kind of little illustration
[45:22] there was this huge battle going on and
[45:27] you know back in the way they had
[45:29] musicians or they have like I know
[45:32] somebody that was in the battle with
[45:35] them and they were playing some music so
[45:37] they will keep the soldiers they will
[45:40] keep them kind of excited going because
[45:43] they were going to possess something
[45:45] amen so but in this specific instance
[45:49] when they were they were fighting and in
[45:52] the end in the general he saw that they
[45:55] were losing he started telling the guy
[45:58] that was playing the trumpet the trumpet
[46:00] he told him hey you know what please
[46:02] play this song to go back please play
[46:06] the song to go back and he was just
[46:07] playing this song to go onwards and then
[46:10] until they defeated the enemy and then
[46:14] and and then and after you know after
[46:16] they kind of were rejoicing on what
[46:18] happened is like they asked him why
[46:21] didn't you play the song to go back and
[46:24] he said a very simple answer and he said
[46:27] because I don't know it because I didn't
[46:31] know it so that is the same message for
[46:35] us this morning
[46:36] if the enemy's car is coming to you this
[46:39] morning and is telling you to go back
[46:41] you don't know that word the only word
[46:44] that we know this morning is to go
[46:46] forward amen the only thing that we know
[46:50] this morning is that he is the same
[46:52] yesterday today and he he is still the
[46:55] same today
[46:56] he's the same yesterday but he is still
[46:58] the same today I mean we should be
[47:01] content this morning to know that Lord
[47:03] you are my healer you are my Redeemer
[47:06] you're my everything this morning and I
[47:10] don't know the word defeat I know the
[47:13] word the work says that I am an
[47:15] overcomer this morning
[47:18] amen I'm so happy to know this morning
[47:21] that in the midst of these insane age I
[47:24] have a sound mind this morning I have a
[47:27] mind and that King worship the work is
[47:29] work I have a heart that that is
[47:32] sensitive to the Word of God this
[47:34] morning a lot of people they are losing
[47:37] that that's incense that sensitivity for
[47:40] the world but this morning you know as
[47:42] we just hear something from him I just
[47:45] want him to come and speak to my heart
[47:47] this morning I just want him to tell me
[47:49] that he is here this morning and he is
[47:52] not just here without a purpose he is
[47:55] here with a purpose in my life this
[47:57] morning she is here to restore the ones
[48:00] that have fallen before but now you can
[48:02] say I am seated now in heavenly places
[48:05] you can say this morning that you are
[48:08] redeemed you can say this morning that
[48:10] you have been restored you can say that
[48:13] you can see your back earning you can
[48:15] see that you came from a broken family
[48:16] but guess what now you are in the family
[48:19] of God and in the family of God there is
[48:22] a father there is a mother and he's the
[48:24] same he's my father he's my mother he is
[48:27] my everything this morning that is the
[48:30] purpose of God for us this morning
[48:32] amen so this morning I can tell you I
[48:35] don't know what I don't know the word
[48:37] defeat I know the word that I am an
[48:40] overcomer amen we're happy to know to be
[48:44] here you know a little bit stress and
[48:47] thinking about that you know in
[48:49] yesterday my wife would like your hands
[48:51] are cold and like yeah when I get a
[48:52] stress on my hands can get cold and my
[48:56] hands are cold right now just pray for
[48:59] me this morning
[49:00] amen amen so let's think a little bit
[49:06] about the life of Joseph and we're gonna
[49:09] go through his life a little bit I I
[49:11] don't want to keep you too long and I
[49:12] know these are Sundays a Father's Day it
[49:14] allows you to all our fathers may the
[49:16] Lord bless you and especially when you
[49:18] have a godly father amen a father that
[49:21] love the Lord a father that have you
[49:24] know endure everything but that they
[49:26] love the Lord we are grateful for that
[49:28] this morning a man I have one that is in
[49:31] Mexico and he sends his greetings
[49:32] brother Marcelo you may remember him
[49:35] he sends his greetings and and he's
[49:37] still fighting the good fight amen
[49:39] and we're let's think a little bit about
[49:41] the life of Joseph and
[49:44] you know he had a calling but before
[49:47] that the the prophecy came to his his
[49:51] predecessors he came to Abraham like I
[49:54] will make of you like a big nation and
[49:57] your sea will possess the gates of your
[49:59] enemies and although although all of
[50:01] those things and it was good to know
[50:03] that it was good to know it in it
[50:06] together as an information but it meant
[50:09] I I can have all the tapes I can possess
[50:11] the gates of its enemies and and he was
[50:13] content he was happy with that but until
[50:16] he came to face a trial then we see how
[50:18] he reacted and he reacted the right way
[50:22] Amen so we can say that after his you
[50:26] know like he had some dreams and
[50:28] everything that was going well for him
[50:30] and these were all kind of types and
[50:32] shadows of something that was that was
[50:34] coming they meant so when when they come
[50:38] to this this this position his brothers
[50:41] they were like you know what you're too
[50:43] much we have to do something with you so
[50:47] after his brothers they planned to kill
[50:50] him they planned to kill him and they
[50:53] put him in the pit you know like they
[50:55] put him there and and they took his
[50:58] seven color garment and they they
[51:00] stained it with that with blood and
[51:02] everything they brought it to the Father
[51:04] letting the father know that that his
[51:07] his son was dead but he wasn't the heavy
[51:10] man he was there in the PA and then they
[51:13] saw him and in and and and that there is
[51:17] a purpose there was a purpose for Joseph
[51:19] to be there he meant that's what we were
[51:22] saying that they they who are
[51:25] predestinated according to the purpose
[51:27] of him Joseph was predestinated occurred
[51:31] according to the purpose of God for a
[51:33] reason Amen because remember that they
[51:35] are in the Old Testament kind of all
[51:38] those were examples of the New Testament
[51:40] and then from the New Testament all
[51:42] those were examples of the church that
[51:43] was supposed to come now amen
[51:46] so how many times you have had
[51:48] situations where you're facing you know
[51:50] like somebody's rejecting you or
[51:52] somebody is is kind of saying it
[51:55] speaking lies about you and every
[51:57] see and that is what happened with
[51:59] Joseph amen
[52:02] I can tell you one thing the lorry had a
[52:05] purpose over the life of Joseph many
[52:08] times we were going through a rough
[52:10] situation we just look at our current
[52:12] state we just look at our current
[52:16] situation but how many times have we as
[52:19] a Lord to show the big picture what's
[52:23] his purpose when we're going through the
[52:25] trial what does he want to show us this
[52:29] morning Oh what can we say this morning
[52:32] Lord when I'm going through an emotional
[52:33] trial because this the word also have
[52:36] come to heal my emotions the Lord also
[52:39] have come to heal my mind amen
[52:43] he has come to heal not just your your
[52:45] your your spirit your natural body but
[52:49] also to healed your mind also to heal
[52:52] your spirit also to heal your soul that
[52:55] you can forgive those that have done you
[52:57] wrong
[52:59] my brother was preaching in our church
[53:01] and he was saying divine love love its
[53:03] enemies
[53:04] its enemies and we have to get to that
[53:08] point
[53:15] amen so
[53:20] what can we say when we're going through
[53:21] a trial or translation that we say Lord
[53:24] why me why am I going through these why
[53:26] wouldn't that other person that is not
[53:28] faithful well the Lord loves you because
[53:30] he wants to try your faith he wants to
[53:32] try your your life and say okay where
[53:34] are you standing are you really trusting
[53:36] in me that even if it is not according
[53:41] to your your expectation you are still
[53:45] going to believe on me that's what I'm
[53:49] saying is that we look at the at the
[53:51] small picture but we don't know at the
[53:52] big we don't look at the big picture
[53:54] where we're on what he wants to show us
[53:57] this morning but now we can see Joseph
[54:01] as an example or as as as a shadow of
[54:04] the Lord Jesus Christ that he was
[54:06] brought to the pit he meant after he
[54:08] died he went he went to preach to those
[54:10] lost the souls that were in prison amen
[54:13] and but he that was not the resulting
[54:16] thing so he had to be there and then he
[54:18] was rose again amen so now what can we
[54:21] say here Psalms 34 17 and 19 and it says
[54:25] the righteous cry and the Lord hear them
[54:29] and deliver them out of out of all their
[54:33] troubles your righteous this morning
[54:35] he's gonna deliver you this morning and
[54:37] then it says in the next verse it says
[54:40] the Lord is night unto them that are of
[54:43] a broken heart how many have had a
[54:46] broken heart I can say amen amen
[54:48] situations trials in life my car has
[54:50] been broken but the Lord is nigh to me
[54:53] this is not if he was nice to me he was
[54:56] close to me at the time and he is still
[54:58] close to you this morning and he saved
[55:02] those those that have a contract a
[55:05] spirit so in other words I was selling
[55:07] the church in in in in Toledo it is not
[55:10] bad to have a broken heart it is not bad
[55:13] to be sad it is not bad to be you know
[55:16] if a contracted spirit because those are
[55:18] the ones that the Lord is seeking to
[55:20] come and heal because many times we hear
[55:24] preachers or people that say no you're
[55:26] supposed to confess everything you know
[55:28] like you that you're not going to any
[55:31] trial that you're going through any
[55:33] situation yeah we are we're as long as
[55:36] we we're still in this human flesh we're
[55:39] going to still fighting ever every inch
[55:42] of the territory
[55:44] it's not bad to say that you're facing
[55:47] something that they've got the wrong
[55:49] position is to stay there the wrong
[55:53] position is a juicer playing the song of
[55:56] defend the position that we as believers
[56:01] are supposed to have this morning is to
[56:03] say Lord I'm facing these but being be
[56:06] by your other
[56:08] I'm gonna process what is mine this
[56:10] morning what do you have this morning
[56:13] that you can say I need to possess this
[56:15] this morning whether it is your mind or
[56:18] people dealing with things that
[56:20] pornography or hard feelings bitterness
[56:24] whatever it is this morning
[56:27] the Lord is giving you a chance to say
[56:28] I'm done with this I wanna go I want to
[56:31] go forward with the Lord that's why I
[56:36] said you can go to trials you can go to
[56:38] tribulations and praise the Lord for
[56:39] those because those are just molding us
[56:42] unto the stature of the perfect man but
[56:44] don't dwell in your mistake that is the
[56:49] one thing that I have learned when you
[56:50] go in your mistake and you start having
[56:52] those pity parties with the enemy when
[56:55] you say all you know what yeah yeah I'm
[56:58] defeated I'm a loser and this and that
[57:01] but whatever you're confessing that will
[57:03] become your possession this morning but
[57:08] as I said it is not bad to go through a
[57:09] trial it is not it is not a wrong thing
[57:12] to go to a tribulation because he's
[57:14] nearby you
[57:16] he's the Bible says you're my
[57:19] authoritarian like he draw nigh to me
[57:21] and I will draw nigh to you cry out to
[57:24] me and I and I will come back will come
[57:26] to you and I will answer you this
[57:28] morning
[57:28] what is your trial what is your
[57:30] tribulation what is your mind battle
[57:32] that you're going through this morning
[57:33] that he's not able to conquer that he's
[57:36] not able to bring the solution there is
[57:40] nothing impossible with God what is what
[57:44] Delian said Lord at thy word I'm gonna
[57:46] go and I'm gonna possess what is ours
[57:49] where was Gil he was given he was like
[57:52] in he was like yes Lord the angel came
[57:55] the word came the word the word gave him
[57:57] up as a commission and he was still
[58:00] doubting it's okay he's it is okay to
[58:02] the hour but underling your doubt
[58:06] because many people that's where the
[58:08] enemy comes and get you and then people
[58:10] get discouraged and that's why they
[58:11] leave Church but I'm not like those that
[58:15] are kind of those are going backwards
[58:17] I'm going like I'm I am part of
[58:19] that are going forward with the Lord I
[58:22] am part of those that said that sale or
[58:25] even though even I'm going through a big
[58:27] trial this morning ler I know that I
[58:29] know that I know that you are my healer
[58:32] I know that you are going to vote with
[58:34] me in the middle of my trial that is his
[58:38] promise at the end of the day this word
[58:42] I can tell you this morning this word he
[58:44] doesn't have any other purpose taught to
[58:46] me in my life I was telling the youth in
[58:49] my back in in church and I was telling
[58:52] them like all these divine love all this
[58:54] tests the virtues of the Podesta the
[58:56] stature of the perfect man those are not
[58:59] to be those we are going to those are
[59:01] not for me to use them when I am on the
[59:03] other side on the other side everything
[59:07] is perfection I need them to fight a
[59:10] good battle here
[59:11] I need temperance to fight to fight the
[59:14] enemy here
[59:15] I need virtue to fight the enemy here
[59:19] what do you need this morning I ask from
[59:23] the Lord amen and the Lord says many are
[59:28] the afflictions of the righteous but the
[59:31] Lord delivered them out of them all oh
[59:41] boy but like and as as we sing sometimes
[59:45] it's like not always as I would but
[59:47] always for my good
[59:49] that is how she's going to liver me from
[59:52] my trials but we are we happy to know
[59:55] that this morning Lord out of my
[59:58] tribulations are of might and
[1:00:00] temptations out of my afflictions you're
[1:00:02] gonna deliver me because that is your
[1:00:04] promise I love all of them he will
[1:00:08] deliver you from for the random says and
[1:00:12] sometimes we have more travels when we
[1:00:14] become a Christian than when we did when
[1:00:17] we were sinners isn't that right isn't
[1:00:19] that true
[1:00:20] amen when you were having you know there
[1:00:22] your drinking is smoking and having a
[1:00:25] big time and the enemy wouldn't bother
[1:00:28] you because you already had you
[1:00:31] but now that he doesn't have you the law
[1:00:35] is gonna allow him to come against you
[1:00:39] and the prophet of God says God promised
[1:00:43] many afflictions strange feelings and
[1:00:45] strange things that will be the on our
[1:00:47] understanding but it is always on for
[1:00:51] our good because you know that the
[1:00:55] street the situation the trial you are
[1:00:57] facing the only thing that is it is
[1:01:00] working in you is that you kind of keep
[1:01:02] growing in the law and I can tell you
[1:01:06] another thing that when you're facing
[1:01:08] that trial that is not even for for your
[1:01:12] for your benefit is for the benefit of
[1:01:15] somebody else because if somebody else
[1:01:18] will face the same now you can come in
[1:01:20] witness to them and say I went through
[1:01:22] that and I did it this way that's and it
[1:01:25] happened to you it happened to me that
[1:01:26] way
[1:01:27] amen the prophet of God says we just
[1:01:30] can't understand it because if we did
[1:01:32] then that wouldn't wouldn't be a faith
[1:01:35] to us we wouldn't go we will go we'll
[1:01:39] just with understanding amen but we do
[1:01:42] it and we have it and we believe by
[1:01:44] faith his word that it is going to work
[1:01:47] some good things for us he says and
[1:01:51] there is none of us immune for a from
[1:01:54] them just talking about the trial says
[1:01:55] the tribulations and if we could realize
[1:01:57] that those things are for our good he
[1:01:59] said that would be a good thing
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:04] but what can we say they write the name
[1:02:06] of the Lord
[1:02:07] it is a strong tower and their righteous
[1:02:11] will run into that tower and they're
[1:02:13] gonna be saved
[1:02:15] talking about the righteous it like it
[1:02:18] doesn't matter it like if you're a
[1:02:20] righteous man you're gonna go to see
[1:02:21] through tribulation through situations
[1:02:22] but remember you are called according to
[1:02:26] his purpose all or what a great purpose
[1:02:29] you have for my life amen
[1:02:32] now look
[1:02:40] Praful Oh God says in the message I know
[1:02:42] he says it is those those hard hours
[1:02:46] that presses on to those sacred to those
[1:02:50] sacred hints in other words like when
[1:02:53] you're in depth in the greatest viral or
[1:02:57] the creator's situation in your life the
[1:02:59] only thing that your tribulation or your
[1:03:01] situation is doing he's just pressing
[1:03:03] you or sending you to his hands it was
[1:03:06] in the Bible and remember no matter how
[1:03:09] the distress is Satan cannot take your
[1:03:12] life until God has finished with you
[1:03:16] there is nothing that can happen to you
[1:03:19] unless God permits that there is no evil
[1:03:24] that can come unless God permits that
[1:03:27] and it is for your good and he is
[1:03:30] working that and we say amen to that it
[1:03:35] is for your good I'm like Laura you sit
[1:03:37] for really for my good yes it is for
[1:03:39] your good
[1:03:40] amen now look
[1:03:44] Jockamo Joseph
[1:03:46] his brother insults all him because they
[1:03:49] were they were have some Yellow Sea
[1:03:51] against him and now he was sold to the
[1:03:53] house of Potiphar and what well he was
[1:03:57] there he became you know because when
[1:03:59] God with somebody it doesn't matter
[1:04:01] where they are they will always be
[1:04:02] prosperous so here we have Joseph he's
[1:04:07] at Potiphar's house and then his wife he
[1:04:10] was always hey come and be with me come
[1:04:13] and be with me you know and he was
[1:04:16] always you know extending the trial and
[1:04:18] he's like no this is not for me because
[1:04:20] you're my my Master's wife you're his
[1:04:24] possession I know that I can I can use
[1:04:26] everything else but not his wife because
[1:04:28] his wife is his possession but you know
[1:04:31] every single day she was kind of after
[1:04:34] him in after him and after him until one
[1:04:37] day nobody was at the house he had the
[1:04:39] opportunity because nobody was there he
[1:04:41] made but what he did he ran away from me
[1:04:45] because there was a purpose in his life
[1:04:47] that he was going to be without seeing
[1:04:49] or he was going to be blameless before
[1:04:50] the Lord
[1:04:54] amen
[1:04:56] and what happened then he was sent to
[1:04:58] prison because somebody lied about him
[1:05:02] how many times we have faced these
[1:05:04] situations with somebody can say a lie
[1:05:06] about us and then we use feel down well
[1:05:08] look at what Joseph's attitude was
[1:05:12] he somebody lied about him and then he
[1:05:15] was sent to prison because and there was
[1:05:17] no justice because he he wasn't to
[1:05:19] prison for something that was unfair but
[1:05:23] even in prison
[1:05:26] Genesis 39 23 he says the keeper of the
[1:05:30] prison
[1:05:30] look not to anything that was under his
[1:05:33] hand because the Lord was with him in
[1:05:36] that which he did the Lord made it to
[1:05:38] prosper even in prison the Lord may may
[1:05:44] may Joseph's life stay to be prospered
[1:05:48] even make when you may feel that you are
[1:05:50] in a pre in a prison or in a situation
[1:05:53] your life is going to prosper I'm not
[1:05:56] talking I'm talking and spiritually I'm
[1:05:58] talking like that you're gonna keep
[1:06:00] growing in Christ I can tell you one
[1:06:05] thing if you have noticed something here
[1:06:06] is that everywhere Joseph was despite
[1:06:10] his trial the scripture was being
[1:06:12] fulfilled many are the afflictions of
[1:06:14] the righteous but the Lord delivered
[1:06:17] them out of them all he was a righteous
[1:06:20] man he was he respected part of our
[1:06:22] house he respected his brethren but in
[1:06:25] the middle of that the Lord was
[1:06:26] delivering delivering him from all of
[1:06:28] that all or helped us this morning that
[1:06:31] that may be major may we be your
[1:06:34] righteous in yours may we be righteous
[1:06:36] in your sight
[1:06:40] having that promise that our tribulation
[1:06:43] you will await that in our tribulation
[1:06:45] you will always be present and set us
[1:06:47] free
[1:06:48] how many can say that Lord when I have
[1:06:51] found the greatest battle ever fought in
[1:06:54] my mind you are there to set me free how
[1:06:59] many people don't raise your hand but
[1:07:01] you may have been in the virtual
[1:07:02] community suicide and the Lord was there
[1:07:06] to set you free out of that how many
[1:07:09] times you were in a position where you
[1:07:11] were like you know what I'm done with
[1:07:13] Church I'm done with the pastor I'm done
[1:07:16] with the musicians I'm going with these
[1:07:17] with that in the other and the Lord said
[1:07:19] no no no you gotta come to church you
[1:07:22] gotta be humble and we're here this
[1:07:25] morning
[1:07:27] those are tribulations or if those are
[1:07:29] afflictions and again I'm not talking
[1:07:32] about the natural stuff because we all
[1:07:34] can face that but I want to make sure
[1:07:36] that when we talk about the spiritual
[1:07:38] real we are free from the enemy why
[1:07:41] because even you know a job said job
[1:07:44] said he said that you know I know my
[1:07:47] Redeemer liveth and he's like even if
[1:07:50] they destroy my flesh I will see God
[1:07:54] because he's his so he says spirit it
[1:07:57] was energy in a different sphere in a
[1:08:00] different atmosphere and our is where we
[1:08:03] are aiming for this morning Lord if they
[1:08:05] come and destroy this flash that's okay
[1:08:09] Lord but don't let them destroy what you
[1:08:12] have build in my heart because that has
[1:08:16] an eternal destination and it is sealed
[1:08:19] until the day of our Redemption
[1:08:21] how many can say this morning I have
[1:08:24] received the holy water the Holy Ghost
[1:08:26] of my inheritance and I know that
[1:08:29] nothing not hell not not that not the
[1:08:32] things that are higher the things that
[1:08:33] are above no no principalities no
[1:08:36] nothing will be able to
[1:08:37] separate me from the love of God nothing
[1:08:40] can break that feel that God has put in
[1:08:43] your heart Amen because when he puts
[1:08:46] that seal in your heart he says this is
[1:08:48] a finished product and thank you saying
[1:08:52] why if a missile is traveling with this
[1:08:55] yes and as I said because you're still
[1:08:56] in this flesh but the one that is inside
[1:08:59] is already still for his eternal
[1:09:01] destination the one that is inside he
[1:09:05] has a purpose he has been called
[1:09:07] according to the purpose of God amen
[1:09:13] what your trial was your tribulation
[1:09:16] that the Lord cannot come and deliver
[1:09:17] you from now there is nothing impossible
[1:09:20] with God it was told to Sarah Sarah
[1:09:24] there is nothing impossible with God
[1:09:25] Sarah was like well but you know like my
[1:09:28] must my My Lord he is 99 years old and
[1:09:31] I'm serving time in 89 or 75 ma is 75
[1:09:37] and 65 and like in according to lore
[1:09:40] time you're going to have a son a son
[1:09:41] and then like 25 years later
[1:09:43] Abraham was still confessing the same
[1:09:45] thing and Sarah was still doubting but I
[1:09:49] can tell you one thing when the Lord
[1:09:51] came Elohim came down and he spoke you
[1:09:54] know like the last sign to the Gentiles
[1:09:57] what was that they secret the revealing
[1:09:59] of the secrets of the heart and then
[1:10:01] when her heart was revealed the Lord who
[1:10:04] could have killed her but he couldn't
[1:10:06] heal her because she was part of Abraham
[1:10:08] so I can tell you that this morning the
[1:10:11] enemy nobody can touch you this morning
[1:10:14] because you are part of your heavenly
[1:10:16] Father this morning what am I going to
[1:10:21] be oppressed because of the enemy this

[1:11:15] purpose are my trial this morning he's
[1:11:21] good isn't he
[1:11:22] I was there with the musicians but they
[1:11:24] were praying I was a you static cry and
[1:11:26] I say Lord thank you so much because
[1:11:28] that we have your word that we can still
[1:11:31] comment here from you the pure word they
[1:11:35] unadopted altar word of God amen
[1:11:39] I mean they're grateful for that for a
[1:11:41] pastor that is still you know is
[1:11:44] standing for this word standing for the
[1:11:47] pure word of the hour should be grateful
[1:11:51] for that
[1:11:52] in support the ministry man
[1:11:56] now look Joseph
[1:12:00] they had then after he was imprisoned
[1:12:04] and he had the you know the cupbearer in
[1:12:07] the in the in the baker and they had a
[1:12:10] dream here he interpret the dream for
[1:12:13] them and everything and then he told him
[1:12:15] remember me when you're back in the
[1:12:16] Kenda and they forgot him but the Lord
[1:12:20] never forgets even if people will forget
[1:12:24] you this morning he will never forget
[1:12:25] him
[1:12:27] amen he is my father he is my mother
[1:12:31] he's my everything this morning look now
[1:12:35] he was imprisoned after ringing the
[1:12:37] interpretation you know today to the
[1:12:39] Baker in the cupbearer in he then they
[1:12:44] remember one of them remember because
[1:12:46] the other one was his his head was
[1:12:48] caught and one of them remembering he
[1:12:50] well you know what I remembered that
[1:12:52] there was a little pastor there he in
[1:12:55] the in that little corners a corner
[1:12:57] store Church that he spoke the truth and
[1:13:00] I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:13:03] why don't you bring him in let him speak
[1:13:07] and then but Luke when somebody is cool
[1:13:11] according to the purpose of God they
[1:13:13] will always give God the praise they
[1:13:16] will always give God his place
[1:13:18] they will always recognize that it is
[1:13:20] not them that have a gift but if it is
[1:13:23] the Lord that has has a gift for their
[1:13:25] lives when they came here to when Joseph
[1:13:29] came before the Pharaoh he told him I
[1:13:30] cannot interpret this dream amen
[1:13:35] he is like because that you know the
[1:13:38] others they wanted him to to let them
[1:13:42] know the dream and that they could bring
[1:13:43] interpretation but Joseph was not a way
[1:13:45] neither Daniel was that way they were
[1:13:47] like you know what the God of heaven the
[1:13:48] God of my of my father Abraham they got
[1:13:51] of my father Isaac Isaac and Jane and
[1:13:54] Jacob and he is the one that can can
[1:13:57] interpret interpret this dream then he
[1:14:01] told him Genesis 41 39 that was now this
[1:14:03] is Pharaoh speaking and Pharaoh said
[1:14:06] unto Joseph for as much as God has shown
[1:14:08] you all these things there is none so
[1:14:10] discreet in wise as thou art thou shall
[1:14:13] be over my house and according unto me
[1:14:15] thy war shall all be my people shall all
[1:14:18] my people be ruled only in the throne
[1:14:21] will I be greater than death and Pharaoh
[1:14:24] said unto Joseph see I have said the
[1:14:27] over all the land of Egypt
[1:14:30] now look it was being said over the land
[1:14:34] of Egypt in Farah took off his drink
[1:14:38] from his hand
[1:14:40] input on Joseph's hand and array him
[1:14:43] investors of fine linen and put a gold
[1:14:45] chain about his neck
[1:14:49] all his trials all his temptations all
[1:14:53] all his tribulations were being paid off
[1:14:58] he was now by the right hand of fair and
[1:15:04] I was saying these the other day Luke
[1:15:08] what was taking place here it was a time
[1:15:11] of adoption for Joseph after all the
[1:15:15] tribulations he went through he was
[1:15:17] being adopted he was being found as a
[1:15:20] true son of God and then if we ask how
[1:15:25] does a child was adopted in the old time
[1:15:27] they have to go to a process of testing
[1:15:30] and learning and they and then and then
[1:15:33] the master is going to come in and give
[1:15:35] the report to their father and say well
[1:15:36] he is not ready yet he's not ready he is
[1:15:39] not ready
[1:15:39] he was wait a little bit but what can we
[1:15:42] say here for Joseph the time king that
[1:15:45] he was ready to be somebody
[1:15:48] to be the son of favor if you if you
[1:15:50] want to see it that way but when they
[1:15:53] they have to like in in that time they
[1:15:56] have to go through a testing and
[1:15:57] learning mainsheet making sure that the
[1:15:59] child has the characteristics of the
[1:16:00] father and that he was going to take
[1:16:02] care of the father of business does this
[1:16:06] sound familiar it was like the prodigal
[1:16:08] son he was put on new ropes having new
[1:16:13] shoes but those are ring means our ring
[1:16:16] I can say it means out thirty what those
[1:16:19] new shoes mean new shoes new shoes mean
[1:16:22] the possession of the world what does
[1:16:24] the Rope mean that is a word that is
[1:16:26] playing in the believer that is being
[1:16:28] placed in the believer amen
[1:16:31] he was position as an adopted son of God
[1:16:33] praise the Lord while working we say
[1:16:35] this morning Lori might be in position
[1:16:37] are you really trusting in me this
[1:16:40] morning amen amen
[1:16:45] he was position he was adopted but now
[1:16:49] the main thing or the greatest trial was
[1:16:52] coming for Joseph it was not when he was
[1:16:55] in the pit it was not where he was
[1:16:57] impressive it was not now that when he
[1:16:59] was in Joseph's house it was now where
[1:17:02] he was going to face his siblings when
[1:17:04] he was going to face his brothers why
[1:17:07] because there's where he could say this
[1:17:09] is time to pay backwards to pay forward
[1:17:11] this is my time this is my hour when I'm
[1:17:15] gonna pay them were all what they did
[1:17:17] but he didn't have that attitude
[1:17:22] Janice is 45 birds for two verse 8
[1:17:27] and it says and Joseph said unto his
[1:17:31] brethren come near to me I pray and they
[1:17:34] came near and he said I am Joseph your
[1:17:37] brother whom you saw into Egypt
[1:17:40] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[1:17:43] with yourselves and that you saw me here
[1:17:46] heater heater I mean for God did send me
[1:17:50] for you to preserve life that was the
[1:17:54] purpose that was Joseph green coal
[1:17:57] according to the purpose of God for this
[1:17:59] what was it to preserve life for these
[1:18:04] two years have the family and the family
[1:18:06] been in the land and yet there are five
[1:18:09] years in the which ye there shall
[1:18:12] neither be hearing nor harvest and God
[1:18:15] sent me before you to preserve you a
[1:18:17] posterity in the earth and to save your
[1:18:21] lives by a great deliverance what was
[1:18:24] happening here
[1:18:26] was heaping paying for or paying them
[1:18:28] back for what they have done No
[1:18:32] why because he was a special type of
[1:18:35] caliber of person
[1:18:38] that's why the Lord he he will Chuck he
[1:18:41] will choose just a few because he knows
[1:18:43] that those are the type of they have a
[1:18:45] caliber of people that they can they can
[1:18:48] do the right thing if I if I ask you
[1:18:51] this morning what would you have done if
[1:18:54] somebody has done all what they did to
[1:18:55] Joseph Lord change my heart
[1:19:04] amen what was the purpose that he had to
[1:19:07] go through all that tribulation Joseph
[1:19:10] he was to preserve the life even to the
[1:19:13] ones that had that hated the things that
[1:19:17] they were meant for evil where for the
[1:19:20] good of many and there was the children
[1:19:23] of God
[1:19:24] the prophet of God says the deserts and
[1:19:27] the in the winds this corpse should the
[1:19:30] scorpions and the cobras in in alone out
[1:19:32] in the wilderness till he almost perish
[1:19:35] there is nothing in this this I love
[1:19:37] there is nothing that can defeat the
[1:19:40] purpose of God can something defeat the
[1:19:45] purpose of God no God has brought Moses
[1:19:49] forth and Moses had to do what what God
[1:19:51] told him to do because gasps purpose
[1:19:54] cannot be defeated I mean he can say
[1:19:59] amen to that God's purpose cannot be
[1:20:01] defeated now if I can ask you this
[1:20:05] morning what is what is his purpose
[1:20:07] because we read it in the in the book of
[1:20:09] officials according to the purpose of
[1:20:11] God according to his will in brother
[1:20:13] Branham speaks and he says there is a
[1:20:15] three-fold purpose of God
[1:20:19] what is the first purpose amen is to
[1:20:22] reveal himself to the people amen the
[1:20:27] first thing he says that was that God
[1:20:29] wanted to reveal himself to the people
[1:20:31] he couldn't do it as a great Yahoo by
[1:20:34] God who cover all his face all time all
[1:20:36] eternity couldn't do that but he he is
[1:20:39] too great to be even revealed to people
[1:20:42] because it would be too mysterious amen
[1:20:44] how cool that great being that never did
[1:20:47] begin that after you went beyond the
[1:20:49] cycle of a hundreds of billions and
[1:20:51] trillions and trillions of years of
[1:20:53] lighted space
[1:20:56] that God that infinite God that eternity
[1:20:59] an eternal God how could he reveal to
[1:21:01] people
[1:21:03] and then the prophet of God says the
[1:21:05] reason how he revealed revealed himself
[1:21:08] to us first is because he loved to be a
[1:21:10] father
[1:21:13] he loved to be he says he loved
[1:21:16] fatherhood
[1:21:18] for he was a father and the only way
[1:21:22] that he could express it was to become a
[1:21:24] son of man amen
[1:21:27] that is the reason Jesus kept saying the
[1:21:29] son of man the son of men they didn't
[1:21:32] know what he was talking about many of
[1:21:34] them he meant but now you get it he
[1:21:37] wants to he wanted to express himself as
[1:21:40] a father he wanted to be a father for
[1:21:43] many that's what we can say this morning
[1:21:46] he is my father
[1:21:47] that is the first purpose that he had
[1:21:49] when when he was kind of when he created
[1:21:52] all these great plan is like how can I
[1:21:54] can I be close to them I wanna have a
[1:21:56] relationship with them I want to be a
[1:21:59] father to them amen that's why also he
[1:22:03] created Eden and there he put Adam and
[1:22:06] Eve and she was a father to them it was
[1:22:08] Jehovah now God dwelling with his family
[1:22:11] but that was not enough Rainie that's
[1:22:16] not enough no because there were more
[1:22:18] attributes that needed to be revealed in
[1:22:25] those attributes you were part of those
[1:22:27] attributes is mourning and even more
[1:22:30] than that he needed to be a savior but
[1:22:34] in order for heavy for him to be a
[1:22:36] savior there had to be something that
[1:22:38] had to be lost he needed to be a healer
[1:22:41] but another in order for him to be a
[1:22:43] healer there was there needed to be
[1:22:46] somebody to be to be it that needed to
[1:22:48] be sick but even greater than that he
[1:22:52] wanted to be a mine delimiter but in
[1:22:55] order for that to happen there was
[1:22:56] something that will have kind of mine my
[1:22:58] battle this morning that he wants to
[1:23:02] reveal himself as that then we say
[1:23:05] deliverer we make her all of that we say
[1:23:10] seeing it very beautifully but how how
[1:23:14] real is that zombie coming to our lives
[1:23:21] he was to one of the main purpose was to
[1:23:24] express himself
[1:23:26] I identify himself with human beings to
[1:23:30] reveal himself in Christ because he
[1:23:35] couldn't say I am the lord that healeth
[1:23:37] thee if he will never experience what
[1:23:41] was to be to be sick or or to be to Cara
[1:23:44] disease that's what he became in Christ
[1:23:48] did Jesus had headaches I will say so
[1:23:51] did Jesus cry yes he cried the he
[1:23:55] captain tation temptations yes he caught
[1:23:57] them but the Bible says that in
[1:24:00] everything he was perfect
[1:24:02] what was that he was to show himself to
[1:24:05] us as the father the son the father what
[1:24:09] it was the father in the creation he was
[1:24:11] he was showing himself to them but I was
[1:24:14] not enough
[1:24:16] prophet of God says what is the second
[1:24:19] purpose he wants to have the preeminence
[1:24:21] the preeminence in the body of believers
[1:24:25] amen now from being the father baby or
[1:24:29] being being Jesus now he wants something
[1:24:31] else now he wants to dwell he wants to
[1:24:35] have the preeminence in his children how
[1:24:39] many children are here this morning and
[1:24:42] I love this topic and I'm gonna say it
[1:24:45] this morning Matthew 10 Jesus goes and
[1:24:50] he commissioned he commissioned a the
[1:24:52] disciples and he told him go and preach
[1:24:54] and heal and cure and cured a day all of
[1:24:58] them he can we read it this morning
[1:25:01] Matthew chapter 10
[1:25:19] look chapter 10 verse 5 and it says
[1:25:22] these twelve send them forth and
[1:25:24] commanded them saying go not into the
[1:25:27] way of the Gentiles and into any city of
[1:25:30] the Samaritans enter ye not
[1:25:33] that's Charlie Matthew 10:5 why am I
[1:25:36] saying this because he's telling then
[1:25:37] golden he'll go to the lost sheep of
[1:25:40] Israel but don't go you don't go to the
[1:25:42] Samaritans don't go to the Gentiles
[1:25:46] and one thing that I have noticed that
[1:25:48] every single time Jesus was it got kind
[1:25:51] of West tire of his journeys he will go
[1:25:53] to the Gentiles
[1:25:56] isn't that wonderful
[1:25:58] because that is when when when that
[1:26:00] Sarah Phoenician woman came to him and
[1:26:02] she said Lord healed my mama I was I
[1:26:05] think was his daughter he says like it
[1:26:07] is not worthy for me to give the bread
[1:26:09] of the children to the dogs and she says
[1:26:13] like Lord yes I know I am a dog she
[1:26:16] recognized her condition but she says
[1:26:18] Lord but out of the master's table the
[1:26:20] dogs they eat the crumbs that fall from
[1:26:23] there and she says like oh I haven't
[1:26:26] heard such faith on in all Israel so
[1:26:30] woman and he said go and let your child
[1:26:34] be healed amen
[1:26:36] that was the first instance and then he
[1:26:39] told him to go to the way of the
[1:26:41] Samaritans and then when he was in John
[1:26:43] chapter 4 Jesus was tired and he went he
[1:26:47] and I and I preached this the other day
[1:26:49] and he needed to go by Samaria who was
[1:26:53] in Samaria there was this woman that she
[1:26:56] was he had something in her heart that
[1:26:58] needed to be changed but she came to the
[1:27:01] wrong source rivers of living water
[1:27:04] we're inside of her she didn't know that
[1:27:08] how can what can we say this morning if
[1:27:12] the rivers of living water are not in us
[1:27:15] this morning but then what is it bring
[1:27:18] me a drink then she said Lord why why do
[1:27:23] you are you asking me to give to bring
[1:27:26] you a drink if Jews and Samaritans we
[1:27:28] don't fellowship we don't get along with
[1:27:30] each other and he asked and he talking
[1:27:32] if you will know who is asking you you
[1:27:36] you will ask him and out of your belly
[1:27:39] rivers of living living water will flow
[1:27:41] out of you and I love this because Jesus
[1:27:47] told the disciples don't go there but I
[1:27:48] will what is he doing this morning
[1:27:53] that's why they we can say that the
[1:27:56] message for the disciples was for just
[1:27:58] for the Jews
[1:27:58] the time but it was there was a greater
[1:28:01] work that he needed to do in himself and
[1:28:06] that's why he's cleared this morning
[1:28:08] that's why his here's killing the broken
[1:28:11] hearts that what he's here he's healing
[1:28:14] the broken minds because it is his work
[1:28:18] it is nobody else's work but it is his
[1:28:21] work he says you guys don't go but I
[1:28:24] will go can he meet your need this
[1:28:29] morning yes he can this morning because
[1:28:31] he says I will go he's expressing
[1:28:37] himself there is a purpose because now
[1:28:39] we're kool according to his purpose now
[1:28:41] he's like an entire Kol according to a
[1:28:44] purpose then I have to go and help him
[1:28:46] to fulfill that purpose amen
[1:28:51] isn't this exciting or what the lore has
[1:28:56] for us is like in one scripture he says
[1:28:57] one thing but in the other he goes and
[1:28:59] doing himself amen
[1:29:08] the next will be other purpose a jihadi
[1:29:11] was to have the preeminence in his body
[1:29:13] of believers
[1:29:15] Roberto God says his bride that he might
[1:29:19] live in people he wants to live in
[1:29:23] people how many can say this morning
[1:29:27] Lord I'm one of them I want you to come
[1:29:30] and live in my heart and the accusers
[1:29:33] are going to come and they're gonna say
[1:29:35] you and I say yeah he said so and that
[1:29:39] settles it I believe it
[1:29:41] amen the enemy is going to come to point
[1:29:44] your passenger say devil do you know
[1:29:46] your future prefer Oh God says he called
[1:29:57] oh that in Adam and Eve but sin
[1:30:00] separated them
[1:30:02] so now there had to be some way to get
[1:30:04] it back again that's why he gave his
[1:30:08] Bligh his life he gave his blood the
[1:30:11] blood of God for who for me because if
[1:30:14] he wouldn't go he's like it is it is
[1:30:16] needed that I will go so that that this
[1:30:18] peer the comfort that will come entering
[1:30:20] you didn't we say didn't we sing if the
[1:30:24] spirit or the scripture says if they say
[1:30:26] if the spirit was raised up Jesus from
[1:30:28] the dead dwells in you he will quicken
[1:30:32] your mortal bodies but even even though
[1:30:36] my body is getting old
[1:30:38] I'm getting tired I get tired now that I
[1:30:41] Drive a lot but it doesn't matter
[1:30:46] because if he's rolling in here he's
[1:30:49] going to quicken that see that is in me
[1:30:54] amen
[1:30:58] he's a savior prophet of God says and he
[1:31:03] had to express that and how could how
[1:31:07] could he do it only through Christ how
[1:31:10] could he be a son only through Christ
[1:31:13] how could he be a healer
[1:31:15] only through Christ see all things are
[1:31:19] in that person of Jesus Christ that's
[1:31:23] why our airing we invited always to come
[1:31:25] and meet the person of Jesus Christ are
[1:31:28] invited always to receive the Holy
[1:31:30] Spirit which is not just the Spirit of
[1:31:32] God not just an emotion I mean not just
[1:31:35] a sensation but the Spirit of God in our
[1:31:37] lives and an even greater to meet him
[1:31:41] face to face that is what he wants this
[1:31:45] morning so the first purpose was to
[1:31:51] reveal himself to the people the second
[1:31:54] purpose was to have the preeminence in
[1:31:56] the indiv REO believers but that is not
[1:31:59] enough
[1:32:01] but is it third purpose
[1:32:05] what was in the Garden of Eden it was
[1:32:08] Adam and Eve a husband in a wife
[1:32:12] relationship there is where he wants us
[1:32:15] to restore us there is where he wants us
[1:32:18] to restore us back to to our
[1:32:20] relationship as a father as a husband
[1:32:23] with his wife that's why the prophet of
[1:32:26] God says now you're a longer a church
[1:32:28] I'm gonna call you a bride
[1:32:31] I'm gonna call you more than a bride I'm
[1:32:33] gonna call you a wife and then where is
[1:32:36] a husband now notice again that's a
[1:32:43] three-fold purpose manifests himself in
[1:32:46] Jesus Christ and then to come and have
[1:32:48] the preeminence in the body of believers
[1:32:51] by Jesus Christ and then what was the
[1:32:54] next purpose to restore back Eden bring
[1:32:58] back that which was lost
[1:33:01] Lord I was lost but now I am found
[1:33:04] therefore I'm on my way to my promised
[1:33:07] land did you say amen to that
[1:33:12] that was the only thing out of order
[1:33:15] amen I was out of order Lord all the
[1:33:19] rest of his things was they were in
[1:33:21] order but he had to put let men the men
[1:33:24] have to be a free for moral agency to
[1:33:27] fall so that he may be a savior to
[1:33:29] displayed what is in him that he can be
[1:33:32] a savior for me this morning
[1:33:34] amen
[1:33:39] he's attributed as a savior something
[1:33:42] had to be lost and everything that men
[1:33:45] fell and became lost he become the
[1:33:47] savior of that oh praise the Lord
[1:33:53] don't just lift up her hands and say
[1:33:55] lord thank you so much for these great
[1:33:58] purpose that you got for my life this
[1:34:00] morning Lord it is that no you you you
[1:34:03] don't you just want to have preeminence
[1:34:06] in my life Lord but now you want to send
[1:34:08] me back where I come from you want to
[1:34:11] send me back to the real it with the
[1:34:14] real Adam and the real if this morning
[1:34:17] blessed be the name of the Lord what can
[1:34:22] we say this morning if God is for us who
[1:34:26] can be against us blessed be the name of
[1:34:31] the Lord how can we just give him thanks
[1:34:39] [Applause]
[1:34:42] can just close her eyes and say Lord in
[1:34:45] all these things thank you Lord and we
[1:34:55] know that in all these things that all
[1:34:58] these things work together for good to
[1:35:00] them that love God to them who are the
[1:35:03] called according to his purpose and then
[1:35:05] for whom he did foreknow he also did
[1:35:08] predestinate predestinate to be
[1:35:10] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:35:13] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:35:14] among many brethren moreover whom did he
[1:35:18] predestinated then he also called and
[1:35:20] whom he called them he also justified
[1:35:23] and whom he justified them he also
[1:35:25] glorified what shall we say to these
[1:35:29] things it God be for us who can be
[1:35:33] against us he that is spared not his own
[1:35:36] son but delivered him out for his all
[1:35:39] for us all how shall he not with him all
[1:35:43] also freely give us all these things who
[1:35:47] shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:35:50] God's elect
[1:35:51] it is God that justified who is he that
[1:35:55] condemneth ascribe Christ that died yea
[1:35:59] rather that it is risen again who is
[1:36:01] even at the right hand of God who also
[1:36:03] maketh intercession for us who shall
[1:36:07] separate us from the love of Christ
[1:36:09] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:36:13] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:36:17] peril or sword as it is written for thy
[1:36:21] sake we are killed all the day long we
[1:36:24] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:36:26] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:36:31] conquerors through him that loved us for
[1:36:35] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[1:36:37] life nor Angels nor principalities nor
[1:36:41] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:36:45] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:36:50] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:36:53] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:36:55] Jesus our Lord
[1:36:57] that is our purpose that is the purpose
[1:37:02] of the Bible believers this morning to
[1:37:08] go back
[1:37:10] where that relationship as a husband and
[1:37:12] a wife was there in Adam and Eve he
[1:37:18] wants us to go back but in the meantime
[1:37:21] he wants to have the preeminence in her
[1:37:23] lives how many this morning can say Lord
