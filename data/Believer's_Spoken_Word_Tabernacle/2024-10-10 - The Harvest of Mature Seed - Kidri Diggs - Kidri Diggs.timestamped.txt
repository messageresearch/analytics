[33:27] Cadre here with us tonight and uh that
[33:29] it worked out that he would be able to
[33:31] be here with us um just um I know what
[33:35] we had been praying uh concerning with
[33:38] that hurricane Milton that came through
[33:41] and um I had contacted some of the
[33:44] brothers there uh today and just to see
[33:48] how things were with them um with
[33:51] brother Jack Duff there on West Palm
[33:53] Beach um you know they didn't have much
[33:57] uh that would have hit them there were a
[33:59] lot of the tornadoes that were just
[34:01] north of them just looking on the map I
[34:02] don't know if any of you looked on the
[34:03] map but I was really looking at that
[34:06] last night and as we were praying about
[34:08] it and so they only some of the people
[34:12] uh of their assembly only lost power
[34:14] there just for a little bit and the
[34:15] power was restored and then I just I
[34:18] just heard back here at 5:30 from
[34:20] brother Danny steeman and their phones
[34:23] had just come back on and so everything
[34:25] with brother Danny he said everything
[34:26] was good with the saint
[34:28] CU they were in Sarasota where it made
[34:30] landfall where the eye came in so uh
[34:33] everything is is good to go uh there you
[34:35] know some of the Saints are without
[34:36] power so we just thank God for his
[34:39] mercies and I know others uh like
[34:41] brother Stacy goodbrad up in Orlando and
[34:43] things like that but um we thank God for
[34:46] his mercies you know within it and I
[34:49] told the boys last night when we were in
[34:50] devotion I said you know think of
[34:53] it when we enter into that Millennium
[34:56] and then the future home
[34:58] there'll never ever be another
[35:00] hurricane never be another
[35:02] storm amen because it's Satan it's the
[35:05] prince of power of the air and we
[35:07] realize he can't do anything unless he
[35:09] gets permission from God but you
[35:12] know as we looked at that down there in
[35:15] in North Carolina and and Tennessee and
[35:17] I'll tell you it's a I continue to hear
[35:22] that from different ones uh from one of
[35:25] Zachary's teachers and different ones
[35:27] they say that even the videos and
[35:29] Zachary's got buddies that send him
[35:31] videos and things too and pictures he
[35:32] said
[35:34] just we send them but it can't even
[35:36] describe what it is and um you know as
[35:39] we've looked at that and I mentioned to
[35:41] you here before when those things took
[35:43] place what a devastating thing to happen
[35:46] but you know that's really only like a
[35:48] little scratch compared to what it'll be
[35:50] in the tribulation
[35:52] to that's why brother BR said cut me
[35:55] open fill me full of sulfur but God
[35:57] don't let me be found here during that
[35:59] tribulation period amen I'm grateful

[38:59] the storm we had
[39:01] some really heavy rains some strong
[39:03] winds it you know it it it it lifted up
[39:07] some trees knocked some things over you
[39:11] know but one thing I I realized that if
[39:14] we go into
[39:16] prayer God hears our
[39:18] prayer you know so everything around us
[39:20] may be getting ripped up and tore up and
[39:23] but in the midst of all of it God will
[39:25] still give you peace so we we had some
[39:29] some lights out and things like that but
[39:32] nobody was hurt none of the houses were
[39:35] tore up anything like that one of the
[39:38] brothers in my church if you don't mind
[39:40] one of the brothers in my church he had
[39:42] a tree a huge tree in his backyard
[39:45] surrounded by other trees and it started
[39:48] leaning towards the house it was
[39:51] actually
[39:52] leaning and his wife called him and said
[39:55] he was driving to work and he was
[39:56] maneuvering around around all the other
[39:58] stuff on the road trying to get to work
[40:00] so he said he just started praying Lord
[40:02] be merciful be
[40:04] merciful church when the tree started
[40:06] falling it was already leaning when it
[40:09] started falling some kind of way it
[40:12] lifted back up and fell the other
[40:16] [Applause]
[40:20] direction and if it would have fell the
[40:22] way it was going it would have hit his
[40:23] shed his carp porch and all that and and
[40:27] he had had so many trees back there he
[40:28] wish he would had taken down but as this
[40:32] tree as it fell it was falling this way
[40:34] but then it started falling the other
[40:35] way and as it fell it took down all the
[40:38] other trees that he wanted to take
[40:41] down so our God is merciful isn't he you

[45:31] Lord oh my God is truly worthy of all of
[45:35] our Praises amen amen if you have your
[45:38] Bibles let's turn to uh Matthew chapter
[45:42] 13
[46:00] Matthew
[46:03] 13
[46:06] uh make the reading short let's just
[46:10] let's just start at
[46:13] um start at verse
[46:16] um
[46:22] 27 Matthew 13 and 27 the Bible says
[46:28] so the servant of the householder came
[46:30] and said unto him sir didst not thou sow
[46:35] good seed in thy Feld from whence then
[46:40] have it tears he said unto them an enemy
[46:44] ha done this the the servant said unto
[46:48] him will thou then that we go and gather
[46:51] them up but he said nay lest while ye
[46:55] gather up the tail
[46:57] he root up also the
[47:00] wheat with them let both grow together
[47:05] until the Harvest and in the time of
[47:09] harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather
[47:12] ye together first the tears and bind
[47:15] them in bundles so burn to burn them but
[47:21] gather the wheat into my
[47:23] bonds amen let's go to um Job chapter
[47:45] 14 Job chapter
[47:51] 14 start at verse
[47:55] 7 for there is hope of a tree if it be
[47:58] cut down that it may Sprout again and
[48:02] that the tender Branch thereof will not
[48:04] cease though the root thereof wax old in
[48:08] the earth and the stock thereof die in
[48:10] the ground yet through the scent of
[48:12] water it will bud and bring forth bows
[48:16] like a plant amen may the Lord a bless
[48:18] reading of his word you can have your
[48:20] seats
[48:27] amen praise the
[48:29] Lord you know tonight by the by the
[48:32] grace of
[48:34] God I want to use for a subject the
[48:37] Harvest of mature
[48:39] seed the Harvest of mature seed and um
[48:46] church I know and and believe that we
[48:49] all know that we're in the end time we
[48:53] are um um we we should be believing that
[48:57] there's not much time down here on this
[48:59] Earth but for us to be in that place we
[49:03] should be looking for a
[49:05] harvest not not you know a lot of times
[49:08] when we think about the Harvest we think
[49:11] about you know uh trees and and branches
[49:15] and all these stuff but I'm speaking of
[49:17] a spiritual Harvest I'm talking about
[49:19] the Harvest of the bride of Christ The
[49:22] Harvest of Jesus Christ in the life of
[49:26] the believer because when you think
[49:28] about time one thing about a tree is it
[49:32] has to grow amen you can plant the seed
[49:35] and as long as you plant that seed y'all
[49:37] know I like talking about the seed you
[49:39] plant that seed in good ground uh it
[49:42] there's a there's a great great great
[49:45] chance that the life that was planted
[49:48] will come
[49:49] forth but it's not done as it starts
[49:52] growing amen you know the growth of a
[49:55] process is you know in time and time you
[49:58] know that seed it it comes at the ground
[50:00] and it goes through different seasons
[50:02] and all that things but there's a goal
[50:05] Hallelujah that that seed there's
[50:07] something there's a manifestation in
[50:09] that seed that has to be unveiled amen
[50:13] and you know right here in the in the
[50:14] book of joob what I love about this
[50:17] scripture look Church it
[50:19] says though the root thereof waxs old in
[50:22] the earth it's old it's dead oh my it's
[50:28] old it's dead and the stock thereof be
[50:30] in the ground it's in darkness oh my the
[50:34] seed is old it's it's dead it's in
[50:37] darkness but then it says yet through
[50:40] the scent of water it hasn't even been
[50:44] touched by the water but the scent of
[50:47] water Hallelujah the scent of water it
[50:51] will bu amen think about that church now
[50:54] we can go outside and a day we can smell
[50:57] the rain before it even starts to rain
[51:00] Hallelujah so let's look at the
[51:02] spiritual application of what it's
[51:04] talking about it said the sea could be
[51:07] dead old rotten in the ground but at the
[51:11] cent of water something in it starts to
[51:15] come forth now we know Hallelujah that
[51:19] Hallelujah water for you and I is a type
[51:22] of rain amen rain of what the anointing
[51:26] yeah Hallelujah and at the scent of rain
[51:31] it unlocked something in the seed
[51:34] amen so church when we worship When We
[51:38] Sing Hallelujah when we come together it
[51:41] shouldn't just be a regular service but
[51:44] it should unlock something because the
[51:47] rain is about to
[51:49] come Hallelujah and you know I love what
[51:53] the what the prophet of God he begin you
[51:55] know early in his church
[51:58] early in this journey you know uh there
[52:02] was a stain upon the
[52:04] Pentecost but then God told him if you
[52:08] want the Holy Ghost go in there that's
[52:12] right
[52:13] Hallelujah if you want it if you want me
[52:17] the anointing is in there the rain is in
[52:20] there and you know now that we've come
[52:23] through all that and people say that
[52:26] we're mature bride Hallelujah you know
[52:30] we're mature you know we we we we got
[52:33] the word and can't even produce what
[52:39] Pentecost how are we
[52:42] mature when we don't even have the same
[52:44] worship Services we don't even have the
[52:47] same prayer life we don't even have the
[52:49] same dynamics that they had in Pentecost
[52:52] Hallelujah when Pentecost is an
[52:55] experience amen
[52:57] now that experience is a part of the
[52:59] tree so we should have the same fruits
[53:02] in our life but we still supposed to be
[53:05] growing amen the anointing comes
[53:08] hallelujah hallelujah that the seed may
[53:11] continue to
[53:13] grow but let's look at a church
[53:15] complacency sets in and we come every
[53:19] every Thursday every Sunday and we
[53:22] experience the
[53:24] rain Hallelujah that's good we
[53:26] experience the rain the anointing
[53:29] Hallelujah the presence of God and he's
[53:32] watering our lives but are still
[53:35] [Applause]
[53:38] growing when we'll come and say I'm
[53:40] mature maturity is not you sitting down
[53:44] being a bump on a
[53:48] log maturity is not you sitting in the
[53:51] presence of God talking about I'm
[53:53] waiting on the
[53:55] word that's so
[53:58] yes at the scent of
[54:03] water I want you to look at your worship
[54:06] Services a little bit different tonight
[54:08] amen when we get together and we begin
[54:10] to worship and sing and sing songs what
[54:13] is it doing it's it's it's unlocking
[54:16] something that's already in the
[54:19] tree that's so good and the reason why
[54:21] we don't catch it because a lot of our
[54:23] trees are stubborn Hallelujah a lot of
[54:27] our trees don't want to give up what's
[54:29] inside so we'll stand there firm and
[54:32] sturdy and say I'm
[54:37] mature that's so good but it's harvest
[54:40] time and it's time to give God what he
[54:43] planted in the
[54:46] earth and if you're not giving God what
[54:49] he planted in the earth you're not
[54:52] mature
[54:54] right Hallelujah yes so good and I'll
[54:57] take it a step further Church Hallelujah
[55:00] we look at things in this season and we
[55:02] say well this got to happen in this
[55:04] proper season remember Jesus went and
[55:06] walked up to the fig tree out of
[55:09] season H you may not feel like
[55:12] worshipping hallah you might have
[55:14] troubles and problems in your life but
[55:16] when you come into the presence of God
[55:18] and God say I want
[55:20] [Applause]
[55:22] something I want something from you
[55:24] Hallelujah now the deci were looking at
[55:27] and they were saying Master it ain't
[55:29] time for us to give it up but this was
[55:30] the creator talking he knew what was in
[55:33] that tree and he asked for it and a
[55:35] treat it and give it
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:39] up I wonder how often we come to church
[55:42] and God is asking for what's inside of
[55:45] you and you won't give it
[55:49] up it's Harvest Time hallelujah amen and
[55:54] when they came back he said Jesus cursed
[55:57] the tree why because the tree didn't
[55:59] give it what it wanted Hall give him
[56:02] what he wanted and you know two often we
[56:05] come to church and we worship and we
[56:07] sing and we take these things for
[56:09] granted but the anointing comes to
[56:11] unlock something in our lives hallelujah
[56:14] amen look when Luther got anointed why
[56:17] did he get anointed because there were
[56:19] other seeds round laying in the earth
[56:22] that when they heard Hallelujah when
[56:24] they heard the just should live by Faith
[56:26] they came
[56:28] forth hallelujah oh my they heard the
[56:31] just to live by faith they were already
[56:33] laying there dorant but something had to
[56:36] happen that would unlock the mystery
[56:39] that was laying inside of those seats
[56:41] that were already on the
[56:44] earth Hallelujah yes sir what the Lord
[56:49] wanted for that age it wasn't to come it
[56:54] was already there right
[56:57] [Music]
[56:58] wow that's what I want you to
[57:01] understand what God wants for this age
[57:05] the manifestations for this hour is not
[57:09] to come it's already on the
[57:12] earth hallelujah it's already in the
[57:18] tree Hallelujah because the life is in
[57:21] the vine and the scripture says he says
[57:23] I'm the vine and ye my branches so we
[57:26] pull from the vine it has to be the same
[57:29] life same manifestation so we bring
[57:32] anything forth if anything is Harvest
[57:35] out of our life it should look just like
[57:38] Christ
[57:39] [Music]
[57:40] right I don't know about you but I'm not
[57:43] settling Hallelujah for anything else
[57:46] that doesn't look just like Christ that
[57:49] doesn't walk like Christ that doesn't
[57:51] sound like Christ that doesn't have the
[57:53] ability to speak like Christ
[57:58] hallelujah what happens is we let Age
[58:01] and and time come in and we say we're
[58:06] season that's so good oh my we're season
[58:10] that's so good you know they they did
[58:12] that in
[58:13] Pentecost uh they did that in Pentecost
[58:16] and you can't produce it you're supposed
[58:18] to be a step further than what Pentecost
[58:20] was that's in you that should be easy to
[58:23] come out of you
[58:27] it should flow out of you when you come
[58:29] in the presence of God cuz that's a part
[58:31] that you should have already moved past
[58:33] Hallelujah but we and you know it blows
[58:36] me away people are mistaking
[58:38] fundamentalism for the Holy Spirit
[58:41] Hallelujah when we don't just want to be
[58:43] fundamental Believers amen hallelujah we
[58:46] want the real life of Christ oozing out
[58:49] of our
[58:50] Lives
[58:52] hallelujah oh my but you know church I
[58:55] love this scripture in job it says that
[58:58] the tree was waxed it was old Hallelujah
[59:01] it was in darkness but at the sent of
[59:06] water yes sir do you get geared up to
[59:10] come here and meet God yes sir or is it
[59:13] just another religious
[59:15] meeting it's just another Wednesday
[59:18] night wow oh my I noticed uh uh tonight
[59:22] we didn't have any specials did we no no
[59:25] specials tonight
[59:27] cuz we holding them to Sunday when
[59:28] everybody here oh boy oh boy oh wow no
[59:34] doubt that song is probably on your
[59:36] heart right now but the people you want
[59:39] to be here is more
[59:43] alive so so and so can see you work I
[59:46] thought the worship was unto God right
[59:50] so Thursday has the same anointing that
[59:52] Sunday
[59:54] has amen it's the same
[59:58] rain it's the same people worshiping
[1:00:01] it's the same people playing so why
[1:00:03] doesn't oh my why doesn't Thursday get
[1:00:07] the same response that Sunday gets it's
[1:00:10] our attitudes Hallelujah every time we
[1:00:13] come together we should expect a
[1:00:16] manifestation of the Life of Christ on
[1:00:18] display in our
[1:00:20] church Hallelujah I don't know about you
[1:00:24] but when the Bible says when two or
[1:00:26] three of us
[1:00:28] gather God is also in the
[1:00:31] midst hallelujah amen amen but you know
[1:00:34] we got our own little way we do things
[1:00:36] and and we don't even realize Hallelujah
[1:00:39] that you're hindering your growth wow oh
[1:00:43] my church put this put put put the good
[1:00:46] tree up and I ain't going to be long by
[1:00:49] the grace of God I'm about to
[1:00:52] close but look look at that
[1:00:57] can you see it good look at that tree is
[1:01:00] it
[1:01:01] beautiful but what makes that tree
[1:01:05] beautiful
[1:01:07] fruit right what good is the tree
[1:01:10] without fruit right it's just an
[1:01:13] ordinary tree you can call it orange
[1:01:16] tree all you want but until you see
[1:01:19] fruit it's just another tree and nobody
[1:01:22] knows what it is it's still a m
[1:01:27] Hallelujah and until we see fruit in
[1:01:30] your life you're just a proclamation of
[1:01:33] a
[1:01:36] Christian Hallelujah because your life
[1:01:39] is supposed to Bear the fruits of the
[1:01:41] vine amen hallelujah and through the
[1:01:44] process of time that tree Hallelujah it
[1:01:48] grew and it grew and it grew and then it
[1:01:50] got to a place to where it couldn't
[1:01:53] contain Hallelujah the manifestation
[1:01:56] of what was inside of it anymore it got
[1:01:58] to a place to where what was inside of
[1:02:01] it it had to be
[1:02:03] released and nothing could stop it
[1:02:06] Hallelujah it got to a place to where it
[1:02:09] grew and it couldn't grow anymore
[1:02:11] without manifesting
[1:02:15] fruit and that's what I'm saying as a
[1:02:17] bride of Christ we should get to a place
[1:02:19] to where we're so hungry for God that
[1:02:21] God just pushes out of us
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:28] hallelujah praise the Lord but what's
[1:02:31] happened
[1:02:32] is we we we we've we've taken the turn
[1:02:36] I'm
[1:02:38] mature you know I'm waiting on the Lord
[1:02:41] you know all these things if I could say
[1:02:43] it like this Hallelujah he said he said
[1:02:46] what happened that these tears got here
[1:02:50] he said an enemy came and did that but
[1:02:53] understand this he said let me uh uh uh
[1:02:56] pluck them up he said no leave them
[1:02:59] alone let them grow
[1:03:02] together they're going to experience the
[1:03:05] same
[1:03:11] anointing sir the same touch from
[1:03:15] God we sing the same
[1:03:19] songs Maverick City and D City and
[1:03:22] Travis Green and everybody else we sing
[1:03:25] it all together Hallelujah and we
[1:03:28] worshiping and and the rain falls on the
[1:03:31] just and the unjust so what separates
[1:03:35] your tree from their tree when we're all
[1:03:38] getting the same
[1:03:42] rain oh my we're getting the same rain
[1:03:46] we're singing uh the same inspiration
[1:03:49] what separates there's two things that
[1:03:52] makes a tree grow Hallelujah one is
[1:03:54] water and the other other one is light
[1:03:57] Hallelujah and it's the light that
[1:03:59] you're receiving that pushes out the
[1:04:01] fruit from your life in a different
[1:04:04] manner amen because it's the same rain
[1:04:07] but we're under a different light
[1:04:08] Hallelujah because we had their light
[1:04:11] but we got their light and
[1:04:13] more so we should have more fruit a
[1:04:17] Greater Harvest a deeper manifestation
[1:04:22] Hallelujah but when we're complacency
[1:04:25] when complacency set in and we say
[1:04:28] well you know I've been around a long
[1:04:30] time uh here we go year after year wow
[1:04:36] when the season come around that tree
[1:04:38] pushes out
[1:04:40] fruit that's good yes sir at what age
[1:04:45] does a fruit tree stop pushing out
[1:04:48] fruit it don't
[1:04:51] right yes
[1:04:53] sir as long as they got
[1:04:56] a free flow of water right and a free
[1:05:00] flow of sunlight it'll continue to push
[1:05:03] out fruit that's it and you take this
[1:05:06] tree Hallelujah right now in Florida
[1:05:10] this tree is getting hammered with winds
[1:05:13] and rain right and and the and the
[1:05:16] tribulations of the elements is is is
[1:05:19] hallelujah almost working for his
[1:05:24] good Hallelujah
[1:05:26] your trials and tribulation is making
[1:05:28] your tree stronger amen cuz as those
[1:05:31] weeds for the hurricane it's pushing
[1:05:34] that tree is forcing that tree to go
[1:05:37] deeper as it
[1:05:38] leans and the winds may push it another
[1:05:41] way and it forces those roots on that
[1:05:43] side to go deeper as it leans so every
[1:05:46] trial forces that tree to give God a
[1:05:50] deeper and a more sincere walk with him
[1:05:54] [Applause]
[1:05:56] and that's what our trials are doing
[1:05:58] your trials shouldn't be taking you out
[1:06:00] of the presence of God but they should
[1:06:02] be making you go
[1:06:09] deeper your trials and tribulations
[1:06:12] really should make you stand your
[1:06:14] ground right because really when the
[1:06:18] winds and hurricanes and tornadoes and
[1:06:21] all that stuff come that tree doesn't
[1:06:23] just give up its life it fights
[1:06:27] for it doesn't give up its position it
[1:06:30] fights
[1:06:31] for it doesn't just get swept away now
[1:06:34] it goes deeper why because it wants to
[1:06:38] [Applause]
[1:06:45] live trials and tribulations comes but
[1:06:49] if there's an anointing in your life it
[1:06:51] should Hallelujah push you to live
[1:06:56] thank you Lord and go deeper in
[1:06:58] Christ am amen but what happens is

[1:10:07] have a child because you're 85 years old
[1:10:10] oh
[1:10:13] my God put him in a situation just to
[1:10:17] unlock the faith that was already inside
[1:10:20] of him and your sickness may be on you
[1:10:23] because God is trying to unlock the
[1:10:25] revelation of Jehovah RFI that's laying
[1:10:29] dormant inside of your
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:33] life hallelujah praise the Lord and
[1:10:37] y'all know I had uh I I begin to think
[1:10:40] about uh I wanted to use a subtitle uh
[1:10:43] called
[1:10:45] introduction you know church I started
[1:10:47] to think about my introduction to the
[1:10:50] Lord and my introduction to the Lord
[1:10:53] wasn't me seeking God come on right
[1:10:55] that's right sir you might think yeah I
[1:10:59] feel like oh man I went to church and
[1:11:01] you know what I cried and I prayed and
[1:11:04] God met me no it started way before that
[1:11:09] right it started way before that you
[1:11:11] probably don't even remember when God
[1:11:13] bumped into you bumped into you and then
[1:11:16] something started to happen where you
[1:11:17] start to crave a better life a better
[1:11:20] lifestyle you you start to lose the
[1:11:22] desire to drink the desire to smoke
[1:11:25] desire to live in the world you start to
[1:11:27] lose all see what happened Christ was
[1:11:29] introducing himself hallelujah
[1:11:32] hallelujah and for me the way God
[1:11:34] introduced himself Hallelujah he allowed
[1:11:37] me to have cancer in my
[1:11:39] brain that was the
[1:11:41] introduction Hallelujah it wasn't a good
[1:11:44] worship service it wasn't good preaching
[1:11:47] it was sickness Hallelujah because God
[1:11:50] knew that there was a revelation down
[1:11:53] inside of me that was waiting to fight
[1:11:56] that
[1:11:57] [Applause]
[1:11:59] sickness wow
[1:12:01] Hallelujah he knew the only thing for my
[1:12:04] life that could defeat cancer was the
[1:12:06] Revelation in me that was laying dormant
[1:12:09] on my
[1:12:11] tree so God allowed my tree to get shook
[1:12:15] up a little bit Hallelujah so it could
[1:12:17] begin to rise Shake It Up and Rise Shake
[1:12:21] It Up and Rise Church you're not
[1:12:24] supposed to die with the shaking but
[1:12:26] you're supposed to get
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:31] taller church when that tree is Shook
[1:12:34] and the roots go deeper the TR the tree
[1:12:37] is actually
[1:12:43] growing
[1:12:44] sir sir in my introduction cancer my
[1:12:48] brain and my mom she comes in and she
[1:12:52] says
[1:12:53] son you don't have to accept us and now
[1:12:57] she comes bless the Lord and she
[1:12:59] introduces me to her godess Lord but
[1:13:02] he's not my God yet but she's
[1:13:05] introducing me to her God hallelujah see
[1:13:08] that's when you're mature when you're
[1:13:11] mature you want somebody else to
[1:13:13] experience God like you know him
[1:13:15] Hallelujah you don't sit there be lazy
[1:13:18] and and and nonchalant and all these
[1:13:20] things and don't care but no you want
[1:13:22] somebody to know God just as good as you
[1:13:25] know God that's the truth hallelujah in
[1:13:29] church she comes and she says son my God
[1:13:32] my God Is A Healer Hallelujah my God has
[1:13:37] already healed you and then she showed
[1:13:39] me the scripture H now I'm talking about
[1:13:41] my
[1:13:43] introduction because if you ever get
[1:13:45] introduced to something that Hallelujah
[1:13:47] stays with you you have it
[1:13:50] forever
[1:13:52] on if the introduction is right you
[1:13:55] can't get it off your mind yes

[1:14:00] met your husband or husbands you know
[1:14:02] how it is when you met your wife there

[1:14:06] stayed on your mind even though you was
[1:14:07] at your house and she was at her house
[1:14:10] but it was the introduction Hallelujah
[1:14:13] maybe the way she she had her hair did
[1:14:15] or the clothes she wear the color her
[1:14:17] eyes or whatever it was maybe it was the
[1:14:19] broadness of his shoulders
[1:14:21] [Laughter]
[1:14:26] whatever it was it got your attention
[1:14:28] Hallelujah and that introduction had a
[1:14:31] last long defect on you Hallelujah and
[1:14:34] you couldn't forget about that person
[1:14:36] they became a part of your
[1:14:41] memory and when you met God Hallelujah
[1:14:45] on his terms to unlock something that
[1:14:48] was laying down inside of you it became
[1:14:50] a part of your
[1:14:53] memory Church God is a part of my
[1:14:59] history

[1:19:50] you come
[1:19:51] on come on Hallelujah
[1:19:55] praise the Lord so good remember you go
[1:19:57] and read your Bible there were there
[1:20:00] were there were three guys H and and and
[1:20:03] and they weren looking for this
[1:20:04] challenge but God knew what they were
[1:20:06] able to do he said hey I'm going to give
[1:20:09] you five talents I want you to bring me
[1:20:10] back five H see God already knew what
[1:20:13] they was capable of so God put them into
[1:20:17] action he put them in the action to give
[1:20:20] him back the same fruit he gave them sir
[1:20:24] now you ask yourself are you giving God
[1:20:27] back what he gave
[1:20:29] you or you just enjoying your time down
[1:20:35] here he gave him five he came back
[1:20:38] happily with five right he said well
[1:20:41] done my good and faithful servant he
[1:20:43] gave the other one two he came back with
[1:20:47] two but then it was one more see God
[1:20:50] didn't get a one who was only able to
[1:20:51] give two five right see he'll put no
[1:20:55] more on you than you can bear Hallelujah
[1:20:58] see God is not a Taskmaster whooping us
[1:21:01] with the conditions of life no he's only
[1:21:04] going to take you through what's going
[1:21:06] to perfect you right
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] amen hallelujah don't you even realize
[1:21:13] it right now if your tree is shaking
[1:21:16] it's the hand of God perfecting
[1:21:18] you you going through trials you got ups
[1:21:21] and downs in your family or whatever it
[1:21:23] is it's God affecting you that you may
[1:21:26] bring forth
[1:21:27] fruit and then he says even if you
[1:21:29] bringing forth fruit I'm going Purge you
[1:21:31] that you bring forth more
[1:21:35] [Applause]
[1:21:36] fruit that's so good sir this is not the
[1:21:40] hour to be relaxing no but we should be
[1:21:44] in even a deeper a deeper consecrated
[1:21:51] desperation look all that the prophet
[1:21:55] was
[1:21:56] doing Vision after vision and healing
[1:21:58] lines and all these things and then he
[1:22:01] comes to the prophet and he says you got
[1:22:03] to be more
[1:22:10] sincere you got to be more sincere
[1:22:13] nothing to be able to stand before you
[1:22:16] you be more
[1:22:17] sincere amen if we examine our lives and
[1:22:21] ask ourselves as individuals not nobody
[1:22:24] else point the finger at each other but
[1:22:26] if you ask yourself right now what does
[1:22:28] it take to be more
[1:22:31] sincere Hallelujah examine your own life
[1:22:36] examine what gives you Joy and now
[1:22:39] examine what you're doing for
[1:22:43] God and I'm not talking about individual
[1:22:47] a accolades but I'm talking about a
[1:22:52] relationship that's right cuz I'm not
[1:22:54] trying to make you a preacher I'm not
[1:22:56] trying to make you go in the corner and
[1:22:57] preach or be a song leader but what is
[1:23:00] your relationship with God
[1:23:04] like because you know when a husband and
[1:23:06] wife get mature with each other they can
[1:23:09] almost tell what one another's thinking
[1:23:11] before they do it that's right that's so
[1:23:14] true the husband will say I ain't going
[1:23:16] to do that cuz she going to get mad if I
[1:23:18] do
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:20] that he begins to know her knows her
[1:23:24] move knows what makes her happy
[1:23:25] Hallelujah he he he he knows what will
[1:23:28] make her sad Hallelujah as they grow
[1:23:30] together they mature together and then
[1:23:32] there's certain things he can get out of
[1:23:34] her that the job can't get out of
[1:23:40] her there some things she can get out of
[1:23:43] him Hallelujah that nobody else can get
[1:23:45] out of them why because they mature
[1:23:49] together they literally have become or
[1:23:52] becoming one amen
[1:23:56] hallelujah
[1:23:59] amen and that's what's happened with
[1:24:02] this
[1:24:05] tree it's become one with the
[1:24:08] vine that's why it's pushing out the
[1:24:10] same life that it was planted with
[1:24:14] hallelujah
[1:24:16] hallelujah and church if we ever realize
[1:24:19] who we are and what God put inside of us
[1:24:22] that we were created not to be separate
[1:24:25] from God but to be just like he
[1:24:29] is we push out the very exact same thing
[1:24:34] Hallelujah that's
[1:24:36] beautiful that's
[1:24:41] beautiful but the problem is we say
[1:24:44] we're
[1:24:45] mature but we can't even see ourself as
[1:24:49] replicas of
[1:24:52] Christ wow that's what Adam
[1:24:57] was Adam was in the very image and
[1:25:00] likeness of
[1:25:02] God hallelujah and I want you to
[1:25:05] understand well you say well Adam fell
[1:25:07] into sin and and and and he had to leave
[1:25:10] the God and sin overcame him
[1:25:17] no
[1:25:18] sin did not defeat
[1:25:23] Adam no that's good Adam like Christ
[1:25:29] laid his life down for his
[1:25:32] wife the devil didn't make him do
[1:25:35] anything Hallelujah the attributes of
[1:25:38] sin didn't make him do
[1:25:39] anything but the Bible said Adam
[1:25:42] willfully Hallelujah willfully went with
[1:25:46] his wife so sin had no control over
[1:25:51] Adam but J what are you saying I'm
[1:25:53] saying when you know who you are the
[1:25:56] situations of Life have no control over
[1:25:59] you you are the dominant
[1:26:03] one amen
[1:26:07] amen Lord thank you Lord and the whole
[1:26:10] spiritual real demon powers know who you
[1:26:13] are Satan knew who Adam was that's why
[1:26:16] he didn't approach Adam because he knew
[1:26:18] he couldn't control God
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:24] and when you realize who you are Satan
[1:26:27] will leave you
[1:26:32] alone praise the
[1:26:35] Lord see there's something and and and
[1:26:38] I'm not bragging I tell us to the glory
[1:26:40] of God and I was in South Africa about a
[1:26:43] month or two ago and we was having some
[1:26:45] meetings and youth meeting
[1:26:47] and demons start manifesting
[1:26:50] itself normally when demons in in
[1:26:53] atmospheres like that
[1:26:55] demons will jump out to bring forth fear
[1:26:58] sure so somebody will get distracted and
[1:27:01] not press
[1:27:05] in Hallelujah and through and through my
[1:27:08] growth
[1:27:09] process I've learned that I don't have
[1:27:12] to fight with every demon come on now
[1:27:15] come on I got
[1:27:18] Authority oh that's
[1:27:20] good you know what we're used to seeing
[1:27:23] is brothers getting up laying hands and
[1:27:25] calling on in the name of
[1:27:30] Jes you ain't never saw Jesus know his
[1:27:33] disciples do that in the Bible there you
[1:27:35] go that's right there you
[1:27:39] go and the Bible says if that spirit
[1:27:44] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:27:47] dwells in you it shall also
[1:27:51] Quicken what kind of body body or what
[1:27:54] is it what kind of body your mortal body
[1:27:58] so you should have power over demons on
[1:28:01] this
[1:28:02] side in your mortal
[1:28:05] body the quickening power is in you
[1:28:08] right now if you got the Holy
[1:28:10] Ghost we're not waiting on a Rapture to
[1:28:13] take our lives back he said it'll
[1:28:15] Quicken you right now if the Holy Ghost
[1:28:18] is in you you got the same Life of
[1:28:20] Christ inside of you
[1:28:24] hallah
[1:28:26] hallelujah hallelujah yes sir so I pick
[1:28:30] and choose when I want to
[1:28:32] fight go
[1:28:34] ahead
[1:28:36] Hallelujah in this particular time he
[1:28:38] start screaming and holling and all that
[1:28:40] and carrying on
[1:28:42] terribly you know and everybody rushing
[1:28:45] over I said stop stop stop everybody
[1:28:47] stop stop stop I say
[1:28:50] stop and it's just because by experience
[1:28:53] right H and we're not boasting all glory
[1:28:56] to God but what I'm making this
[1:28:59] statement just to
[1:29:01] show that if the Holy Ghost is in
[1:29:04] you it's the same
[1:29:07] life that said to Legion what is your
[1:29:14] name make the devil identify himself
[1:29:18] goad call out the spirit that's
[1:29:20] troubling you and see right now God's
[1:29:23] trying to get somebody Deliverance cuz
[1:29:25] it then switched over to talking about
[1:29:27] demons oh my in church Hallelujah you
[1:29:31] notice Jesus they will walk up and they
[1:29:33] would say us and Jesus would say hush
[1:29:37] right hold your peace don't tell nobody
[1:29:39] who I am all right and they would say
[1:29:43] but God but this they would shut up hush
[1:29:45] and
[1:29:46] leave just like he said now if the Holy
[1:29:50] Ghost is in you that don't
[1:29:53] change it's still the same
[1:29:55] life it's whether or not you believe
[1:30:01] it he started screaming and holling and
[1:30:04] doing all the caring on terrible I and I
[1:30:06] realized it was a spirit of fear to try
[1:30:09] to get all the other young people not to
[1:30:10] enter in Hallelujah so I walked up to
[1:30:13] them by the grace of God and I
[1:30:16] said shut
[1:30:18] up and come out
[1:30:22] silently and stop scream put head on oh
[1:30:27] wow I say I said come out silently close
[1:30:31] his
[1:30:33] eyes I said look at
[1:30:38] me they know who you are
[1:30:41] [Music]
[1:30:41] [Applause]
[1:30:43] Hall remember Jesus walked the Earth in
[1:30:47] what not as a spirit but in a body of
[1:30:50] Flesh his Spirit was in that body
[1:30:55] Hallelujah he walked that he walked the
[1:30:57] shores of Galilee and all through the
[1:30:59] scriptures how in a body of Flesh to
[1:31:02] show us that if his Spirit dwells in our
[1:31:05] body it'll do the same
[1:31:11] thing
[1:31:14] hallelujah praise the Lord amen
[1:31:17] hallelujah church we
[1:31:19] prayed cast the spirit out and that was
[1:31:23] it
[1:31:24] young man got
[1:31:26] delivered in the next service you know
[1:31:28] what he was doing on the front row
[1:31:30] experiencing the
[1:31:32] rain worshiping
[1:31:35] god what the enemy does to people when
[1:31:38] they get Deliverance it brings a spirit
[1:31:40] of embarrassment and then they get in
[1:31:42] church and they
[1:31:43] like no you ought to be rejoicing
[1:31:46] because Satan has no more ho over your
[1:31:48] life Hallelujah
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:31:55] what are you saying I'm talking about H
[1:31:57] the Harvest the mature Harvest of God's
[1:31:59] life right so if we look Church we've
[1:32:02] been we've had this message Hallelujah
[1:32:04] for over 60 years the tree has
[1:32:10] grown the tree is
[1:32:13] mature the tree is pushing out
[1:32:16] fruit Hallelujah we should expect
[1:32:20] it amen amen I'm about to close don't
[1:32:24] get nervous give me the next
[1:32:30] one see that
[1:32:33] tree what's the
[1:32:36] difference it got fruit on it but it's
[1:32:42] dying at one point in his life it was
[1:32:46] vibrant right right I'm in the message
[1:32:48] of the hour God s the prophet oh
[1:32:52] Hallelujah vibrant
[1:32:55] couldn't wait to get to church couldn't
[1:32:57] wait to sing songs hallah it was pushing
[1:33:01] out fruit right but now that same tree
[1:33:05] is
[1:33:07] dying this is very touchy CU I want you
[1:33:11] to understand something the tree is not
[1:33:15] a hypocrite because it has
[1:33:19] fruit it's it's produced The Very life
[1:33:22] that's within it right that's right but
[1:33:26] it's come to a stage in his life where
[1:33:29] something has caused a drought
[1:33:34] my and Brother Sam sometimes people that
[1:33:37] say they're mature they stopped singing
[1:33:40] they stopped worshiping they stopped
[1:33:41] clapping they stopped coming to prayer
[1:33:44] they stopped you know doing the things
[1:33:45] that they once did when they were
[1:33:47] younger and say yeah you know I'm a
[1:33:48] little older
[1:33:50] now you're entering into a Dr out that's
[1:33:55] right and I'm not saying that you're not
[1:33:58] bride everything on here is
[1:34:01] seed Hallelujah but you must remember
[1:34:04] there were five wise and five
[1:34:07] foolish Hallelujah and the foolish did
[1:34:10] what they're going to go through the
[1:34:13] tribulation and it's only God that can
[1:34:15] have mercy on him they had oil but they
[1:34:18] just didn't have enough right amen we
[1:34:22] don't want to be in that condition
[1:34:26] how you going to say you mature and you
[1:34:28] stop
[1:34:30] growing the process has
[1:34:33] reversed it's no longer growing it's
[1:34:36] dying that's Hallelujah even though at
[1:34:39] one space in his life It produced
[1:34:43] fruit right
[1:34:46] right normally if a tree get in this
[1:34:48] condition there's a couple things that
[1:34:51] can happen that causes it to die
[1:34:55] either is not getting a free flow of
[1:34:59] water it comes to church and don't
[1:35:05] participate so
[1:35:07] good I'm just
[1:35:09] here and the bad part about
[1:35:13] it we have the words up on
[1:35:17] yeah we have the words up here and some
[1:35:20] people still won't open their mouth to
[1:35:21] worship God
[1:35:24] wow you're in a
[1:35:26] drought
[1:35:28] hallah either the tree is not
[1:35:31] experiencing the rain hallelujah or the
[1:35:36] light is not hitting it like it's
[1:35:39] supposed
[1:35:41] to and we find out in this time in this
[1:35:44] hour everybody all right sir now let me
[1:35:46] let's understand something this message
[1:35:48] tonight is not a rebuke it's an
[1:35:50] encouragement
[1:35:52] right Hallelujah
[1:35:54] because what I'm saying there's
[1:35:56] something in you that God wants to see
[1:35:59] there's something in you that God wants
[1:36:02] back because he put it in
[1:36:04] you
[1:36:06] Hallelujah don't let the devil bring a
[1:36:08] uncertain sound no I'm trying to
[1:36:11] encourage you to be what God made
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:15] you I'm trying to encourage you to not
[1:36:18] Hallelujah sell yourself short amen see
[1:36:21] Church we're not a tree pesticides we
[1:36:24] are an organic
[1:36:27] tree
[1:36:30] Hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah I don't
[1:36:33] need entertainment Hallelujah to worship
[1:36:38] God I don't need a special meeting to be
[1:36:41] on be on time for church no My Worship
[1:36:44] is
[1:36:48] [Applause]
[1:36:50] organic hallu Hallelujah so good sir
[1:36:55] organic means that I don't need some
[1:36:58] created substance to make me grow come
[1:37:01] on all I need is the natural things that
[1:37:05] God
[1:37:06] provided because it will automatically
[1:37:08] connect with
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:14] me
[1:37:16] Hallelujah but what I love about
[1:37:19] this this tree is dying
[1:37:25] either look at your own
[1:37:28] life
[1:37:29] either is not experiencing the
[1:37:32] rain and that's a lie because every time
[1:37:35] we come God is
[1:37:39] here amen hallelujah hallelujah I could
[1:37:44] have just came up and read a scripture
[1:37:46] Hallelujah and we would worship shout
[1:37:48] this place down as we just
[1:37:52] sang y'all feel like that I
[1:37:55] did I had to cut the song the song short

[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:00] [Laughter]
[1:51:06] yet listen this going to wrap up what I
[1:51:10] was
[1:51:13] saying this
[1:51:15] quote is in here ye
[1:51:18] him
[1:51:20] um 57
[1:51:23] 57
[1:51:24] 807 he says now how is it we are the
[1:51:30] branches can I get amen amen he is
[1:51:33] divine how many know John 15 teaches
[1:51:37] that Jesus said I am the vine ye are the
[1:51:40] branches now this what the prophet God
[1:51:42] say he says now the vine does not bear
[1:51:48] fruit you go the vine does not bear
[1:51:51] fruit does
[1:51:53] no sir the branches bear fruit the vine
[1:51:56] only energizes the
[1:51:59] branches church we should be energized
[1:52:02] when we experience the rain when we come
[1:52:04] in
[1:52:05] here hallelujah it should be like David
[1:52:08] when he worshiped and it drove out
[1:52:10] demons that was on Saul and Saul said I
[1:52:13] feel
[1:52:16] refreshed and the anointing that was on
[1:52:18] David was the same anointing that God
[1:52:22] on
[1:52:24] amen he said David was a man out of
[1:52:26] God's very own heart and David was so
[1:52:29] anointed that he could drive out a
[1:52:31] spirit that God put on
[1:52:35] somebody why it was the same
[1:52:38] life
[1:52:40] am
[1:52:44] hallu he said no so the branches bear
[1:52:46] fruit the vine only energizes the
[1:52:48] branches he says well now we're branches
[1:52:51] that's God's word now don't look and say
[1:52:54] brother Brandon this or John this or so
[1:52:57] and so Jesus is the one you're looking
[1:53:00] to he's the life of the vine he's the
[1:53:04] life of the branch and the same life
[1:53:07] that's in the vine will be in the
[1:53:11] branch that's
[1:53:13] right
[1:53:16] good if Jesus is divine and we are the
[1:53:20] branches the same life that's in Christ
[1:53:23] should be in
[1:53:25] us he said the same
[1:53:27] life that's in the vine will be in the
[1:53:30] branch and it'll produce the same life
[1:53:33] that's in the vine if it's truly a
[1:53:36] branch now if we're the branches Christ
[1:53:40] will
[1:53:43] appear hallu so as musicians come
[1:53:47] brother digs how do we get
[1:53:50] there how does that tree get get back to
[1:53:52] being a good
[1:53:54] tree it's very
[1:53:57] simple the prophet of God say that tree
[1:53:59] it
[1:54:00] grows and it grows and it grows but what
[1:54:03] I like he says when it's this
[1:54:05] High everything it stands in need of is
[1:54:09] in it right there in that
[1:54:11] moment every every
[1:54:13] bushel every limb every Branch every
[1:54:18] seed every piece of fruit that it'll
[1:54:21] ever prod
[1:54:23] is in it when it just High
[1:54:28] that's he said what does it do he said
[1:54:31] it drinks
[1:54:32] in and then it pushes
[1:54:35] out but this is the key right it doesn't
[1:54:39] just drink
[1:54:40] in it drinks in more than what it
[1:54:45] needs there you go so if you want to see
[1:54:48] Christ manifest out of your life you got
[1:54:52] to give him more time than just
[1:54:53] Wednesday and Sunday or Thursday and
[1:54:56] Sunday if the only time you pick up your
[1:54:59] Bible is is Thursday church and Sunday
[1:55:02] church you'll never be able to push out
[1:55:04] those
[1:55:06] fruit because you're not drinking in
[1:55:08] enough of him so you got to be so indued
[1:55:12] with him so overpowered with him till he
[1:55:15] can't help but just push
[1:55:21] out drink in and push out church that's
[1:55:24] what we were supposed to do
[1:55:27] amen a friend of mine
[1:55:31] in London
[1:55:34] UK I might have told y'all this she
[1:55:37] planted a pear
[1:55:40] tree she planted a pear
[1:55:42] tree and the tree grew and it grew and
[1:55:45] it
[1:55:45] grew then it was just a nice pretty tree
[1:55:49] and the seasons went out season came
[1:55:51] back in
[1:55:53] Seasons went out Seasons came back in

[1:56:01] planted so it went by a year went by
[1:56:03] another year went by the trees the the
[1:56:07] the size of it is
[1:56:09] mature but it's not pushing out no
[1:56:13] fruit so she didn't Google
[1:56:17] it she didn't get a tree tester to come
[1:56:20] test the tree
[1:56:23] she walked up to the
[1:56:28] tree she walked up to the tree and she
[1:56:31] said I know you're a pear
[1:56:35] tree and if you don't give me no pears

[1:56:46] around next year then the Harvest start
[1:56:49] the limbs got green and the next thing
[1:56:51] you know PS start coming from everywhere
[1:56:54] out of that

[1:57:07] prayers the PS and take them to church
[1:57:10] and give them out to the
[1:57:13] Saints
[1:57:15] hallu what happened it was Jesus

[2:08:40] amen yeah let everything that have
[2:08:43] breath yes Praise You the
[2:08:47] Lord you know I was thinking brother
[2:08:50] codre was ministering our couldn't help
[2:08:51] but think about brother Brandon puts it
[2:08:53] in one in a million he
[2:08:54] says healing is in you already yes sir
[2:09:00] Deliverance is in you already praise the
[2:09:03] Lord he said but it's Satan's duty to
[2:09:06] keep you blinded from that fact he said
[2:09:09] but God brings somebody on the
[2:09:12] scene that can see what's
[2:09:16] there and then that somebody tells you
[2:09:19] what's there God sent in this hour
[2:09:24] someone and that same one that sent
[2:09:27] Malachi 4 is the same God right here
[2:09:30] Among
[2:09:32] Us amen letting us know what is already
[2:09:36] within
[2:09:38] us amen it's already there and there's
[2:09:41] no no leaf that has to be added from the
[2:09:44] outside no no fruit from the outside
[2:09:47] everything is from
[2:09:49] within it's just like what was spoken
[2:09:51] here tonight from the scent of water
[2:09:54] just letting go when you begin to sense
[2:09:56] even God just drawing and dealing and
[2:09:58] moving upon your heart just release it
[2:10:02] just
[2:10:02] release anything at all just release it
[2:10:06] if there's anything that that's holding
[2:10:07] you back anything that's come in any
[2:10:09] disease just release it just let it let
[2:10:11] it go say
[2:10:13] God forgive me Lord cleanse me Lord
[2:10:17] Jesus from the depths of our
[2:10:19] life it allows God to move on in our
[2:10:24] lives I certainly I believe tonight we
[2:10:27] like any other time we don't come to be
[2:10:29] entertained right right but we want to
[2:10:32] be we want to be participants right
[2:10:35] amen because we read that quote last
[2:10:37] Thursday it's the surrender we
[2:10:41] have receiving the word and then the
[2:10:44] word in the beding ground reacts
[2:10:47] back that's this is what makes you know
[2:10:51] what can make what really will make us
[2:10:52] makes us rejoice is because when you
[2:10:55] know God and then you can see already
[2:10:59] the victory over whatever the situation
[2:11:02] over whatever the need is
[2:11:05] hallelujah that's what really that's
[2:11:07] what brings a real worship that's why
[2:11:10] when the word is coming forth it's an
[2:11:12] open Vision that begins to break over
[2:11:14] our life and we can begin to see
[2:11:16] ourselves
[2:11:18] amen that it's it's finished it's
[2:11:22] finished and I'd say here tonight that
[2:11:25] before As we sing another song here if
[2:11:27] you would like
[2:11:29] prayer amen our brother's here to to
[2:11:32] pray with you amen I I wouldn't walk out

[2:11:38] need on your heart or something on your
[2:11:40] heart I believe God is here when he
[2:11:42] spoke all the way through this service
[2:11:45] God is so mindful of all of our needs
[2:11:47] aren't you glad of
[2:11:49] that I tell you I've I I've witnessed

[2:11:54] witnessed how things that God has taken
[2:11:57] down Avenues and directions and things
[2:11:59] like that you know I've never been
[2:12:02] disappointed when God has got me off of
[2:12:04] my
[2:12:06] notes I mean I might have felt like it
[2:12:08] was scrambled aches at the end of it but
[2:12:10] the thing of it is is I'll say it like
[2:12:12] this that no matter what the need is
[2:12:13] that God has spoken to God loves his
[2:12:17] children and he cares so
