here tonight amen your body may not feel like it but your soul it's so glad to be here so let's turn here in the scriptures we just don't want to go just to two verses where we've been drawing from here in Exodus 15 and I want to just read these two verses of Scripture tonight verses 25 and verses 26 and verse 25 it says and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet very made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them so this was not a show it was God showing them letting them know a statue an and ordinance it was it was a word and I'm so glad that God gives us this by experience this is an experience so here in verse 26 what we're going to read in verse 26 is actually the casting of the tree into the waters when this comes about in their life and he said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to His commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which have which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the lord that he Levine that's what I really want to emphasize on tonight that last part for I am the Lord that healeth thee amen may God bless you bless the word of being seated tonight truly as we look there in the scripture we we have the promise that God has has given to us we realized that as the Lord was speaking to the children of Israel in that time in verse 26 he he makes known to them even a covenant of his word that if they will give diligently and hearken diligently to the word and will do what is right in his sight and give ear to his Commandments in other words to be fully taken with him with a desire to please him that truly God himself has made this this this declaration that I will put none of the diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that he loved thee now undoubtedly they you know this situation and the experience that they had witnessed here within the the bitter waters God would take this experience and let it be an experience to them that they would give witness that when there would be bitter situations that they would come into there would be times that their bodies they would suffer they would be afflicted God never said you'll never be sick you'll never be afflicted you'll never go through those things we realize that back in Eden as we keep moving back to that place that it was there they walked without any sickness whatsoever Adam or Eve they never had experienced any cold they never experienced a headache there was never any toothache there was no sickness whatsoever but we realized that what allowed sickness to enter sickness itself was only an attribute or an attribute of sin of unbelief and how that when they fell from the word then we find aware that that of death sets in and we know that sickness all of that is associated with death and with sin and as we were just looking at this last week and looking at how that even in our lives in our bodies even for as a child of when our soul has been completely redeemed it has been we have we have come under that reality by the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet there are two parts of our life that has not been redeemed yet our body is still in a state that our body has not been redeemed now we still we steal from within our lives we have to battle within our lives to keep our spirit clean to actually keep out things that are that are unwarranted and how the enemy would want to try to attack in through those gates of our spirit but things be to God for the seal of the Holy Ghost on our soul we thank God for that it becomes more dear and more precious to us as the days go on and we realize that that that in itself we have within it the same Living God that is dwelling within our lives and is there to guide and direct us I want you to look at these words I I'm not going to dwell so much on them tonight but it's very much similar to that of verse 26 in proverbs chapter 4 verse 20 he said my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh this is the greatest health plan there is it's health to all our flesh what is the attending to the Word of God giving ourselves to the Word of God we're not serving God there's not one of us here tonight I believe as a as a child of God we are not serving God because of what we can get out of him but this happens to be one of the benefits when we are walking in the presence of God serving the Lord we have the promise of this word and in this word there is no well maybe he will heal me well if it's the Lord's will I think of how dr. Bosworth would say it like this he said those are faith killing words if it be thy will to heal me he said then we don't say those words like that you know many times when you read that you realize why even brother Brandon brother bras words were so close when you read many of the words that brother Bosworth you know they were sitting right there right next to one another but I'll and those are things that just struck me even you know when we approach the word of God how that we realize we are not to approach it in a maybe or if it be thy will but we realize that when we are praying for healing we are always in the will of God it is in God's hands entirely amen and this is the promise that we have is that then we are not serving God because in our life well you know in my life I need to you know to have a better life or I'm sick and I need to be well that's not why we're serving God this just happens to be the benefits of a heart Venna that gives complete place to the Word of God I believe that with all my heart I'm oh how many are witness to that tonight they are life under those that find them and health to all their flesh now look here in in in the message and condemnation by representation brother Brandon would put it like this he says our Heavenly Father we bring to you this great line of sick people God just think many of these in here I trusted every one of them are your children and born of the Spirit washed in the blood filled with the Holy Ghost and and ready for the coming and Satan can't get them that way to make them sin he can't get them to make them doubt your word is wrong they go ahead and follow it just as to the letter but then he tries to come along and afflict their body because he knows that their bodies still sin but their soul is saved their body's got to go back to the dust of the earth but their soul goes to God so he tries to afflict that part what he can yeah when the saw has been sealed Satan cannot afflict the soul Satan could come and he can try to afflict the body he can even come and try to afflict the mind by injecting of thoughts but he cannot afflict that soul that soul has been healed there has come a and not just a permanent but an eternal healing there is no sickness no more in the soul with the actual curse of the snakebite has been lifted from off of our life so we are living in that of under the shed blood of the Lamb and yet within our bodies we can still experience sickness and we have to war and we battle but how great it is to be in this battle how wonderful it is now notice I'm so glad that you included salvation for that body - aren't you glad because you realize that it just don't it's not just something that just comes just even as just to be an earnest of the resurrection which brother brand goes on to say this is the earnest of the resurrection the healing of our bodies we realized that here there is an end Paul would say it like this in the book of Thessalonians there is the end of our salvation now if there was the beginning of our salvation with the deliverance and the healing of our soul but there must come that of a body that matches our soul and to think that the God is not making you know elects that of a wedding guest you know the scripture talks about all who do not have the wedding garment on you realize that the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon your soul is a clear it's the token it's a clear sign you have God a garment there on the other side you've got a body like Peter said that is reserved it's undefiled it's unspotted there is no weaknesses within it it is there in the presence of God that feel for me body hallelujah and then through all of this how that there will be and comfort that of the glorified body where you and I will live eternally and that's where brother Branham would say in the message future home he said what is he says what is the future hold its eternal life in a human body hallelujah glory we were not we were not made to live out there remember this is our home now notice when Jesus came here he sent forth the disciples and he told them I want you to go preach saying in matthew 10:7 go preach saying that the kingdom of heaven is at hand now we know that the kingdom of heaven is that which is to set down here upon this earth but as yet the kingdom of heaven has not set up on this earth but there has been an issuing of the kingdom of God into the heart of the believer by the Holy Ghost and so Jesus noticed he is telling them announce and I want you to declare the kingdom of heaven is at hand I wish I could just preach on that a little bit but to think of it here an announcement and here we are two thousand years even so later but that announcement it still is a declaration it was announcing to Satan that what was done there in the disobedience of one here stands one to be able to bring back and restore all that was lost in the fall so I'm going to announce it and not only did he announce and he said I am going to put my life into my children and win since now you have permitted them they will permit you hallelujah I [Applause] feel like preaching but I the kingdom of heaven is at hand notice what he said heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out Devils freely you have received freely guilt and think about this they hadn't even received the the do Thomas power of God the Holy Ghost but they had received authority from Almighty God from the Lord Jesus I want you to put this together now you and I have received the Holy Spirit and think of the word that we have received what God has personally given us because the Holy Ghost is the Word of God made flesh in you hallelujah you and I have been authorized by the king himself heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils and yet in our strength we can't do it but there is one behind us I am the Lord that healeth thee I am not once now will be I am the Lord that he loved thee hurled sums 9110 there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling I think one time when my daddy was there on we were living out there you know right out of Salina and in him close to Rockford and you know down on that side of the state I guess we can claim it as Ohio but it's just to me as flat as a pancake and you can you know see things for well we'll just be anyhow what was happening is is that he could see in round that Fort Wayne area there is always tornadoes around and that's all I remember growing up it was nothing but tornadoes coming around that Fort Wayne area and I remember that one time my daddy when he came out there and and here came a tornado and it was coming and he could see it he said Lord you said in your word that not a plague shall come nigh thy dwelling he said so storm you gotta turn you can't come this way [Laughter] the storm turned [Applause] hallelujah now notice this neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling you know brother Branham talks about this in the earlier years of germ warfare coming up on this earth are you with me but this is the promise you and I have neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling that'll mean that we act ignorant and we're smart about it but we've got a promise and you say why is that promise so certain because all of these things that are all around us it's enough to where you could walk paralyzed in fear but let me tell you you don't have to walk in fear I am the lord that he loved thee I will not let a plant from not-bad dwelling I don't care what they create in a laboratory I will not let a plague come nigh thy dwelling [Music] probably some of you have read a little bit about I hope I get it pronounced right the coronavirus or whatever more I looked a little bit in it and that was it one thing I come back to though what I look at is I read a little bit in it but the first thing even before all that the first thing i suppo i thought of is the prophet of god has already spoken concerning Jorma germ warfare but you know there's a greater germ warfare that's going on it's a germ warfare of sin but God in this hour he's sent an inoculation it's not a different serum it packs within it the same authority that was given there on the day of Pentecost the enemy can try to engineer this and engineer this but brother the blood has never lost his power never lost his power Amen that's what this message comes to do is to reveal the power and the blood of Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that now I want you to look at this here for a moment in Psalms 105 37 it said he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes I read that promise was looking at this for some time and I couldn't help but read that and I thought of how the scripture says they which are alive and remain did you think of it in this manner how that mini brother brand would say like this he said for somebody with cancer he said how he said that he said it can come down to the very last moments he said and then once he said God will step on the scene and reverse that death has tried to come but then the earnest of the resurrection comes and reverses that you see friends the disease and everything it has its boundaries it can only go so far and remember before the Satan can ever even touch your body although my body and your body is still sin he can't touch it till he gets permission are you with me you can't touch it remember if we see that in Joel chapter one but to think of this in that manner I wonder how many will be standing here and and we know that when that sweep comes over there Oh Mound that resurrection morning to think of how that the dead in Christ shall rise first and when we begin to see them they will come to us oh brother we will see them none of the rest of the world will see them but we will see them after you talking about a spark and a stimulation of our faith there will be a spark and a stimulation of our faith because what we will see is the word standing before us and we know that we are a part of that word and we will be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye crooked bats come up straight I could go on and on with that one right there but there has been and there will be testimonies that will spend triumphant by the faith of God that will give that final witness that the hold of death has been lost I want you think about not a feeble one among here come here here come a message listen to me now this is simple I know but here come a message and in that message it came and then let him know that that I have heard your cries and that message begin to unfold God sending his messenger identified by the pillar fire and the word and how that he went here they come out of Egypt think about it they came out of Egypt they did not come out carrying food we know they had unleavened bread but yet they did not come out with the food supply one food trucks following him down the road but they came out and you see even in that right there God was testifying that I've got all of this I am your provider what do what was God saying within all of that data pertains to you and I right now you don't need to weigh I am your everything I am your provider I have already thought of everything that will be needed all along the way in that wonderful he already thought of it and so we find that even when we look at Moses you know how brother Brandon would call it you know doctor Moses and say Moses had a medicine chest and all he said if we could just look in that medicine chest now I want some big cabinet you know that had something on the wall but it was it was something where he there was a promise that was made and that was given in that medicine chest you see there were things that you know perhaps that maybe you didn't think of but to think of how that there would be hurts and aches and cancers and blindness and dumb deafness had done this that would would arise on their way to the promised land but God said I've got everything covered aren't you glad for that Bill Graham said oh he said there would be one to say Moses my father he's been over here he broke his leg today he fell and he broke his leg well what do you got for him he said well let me just look and see yeah thou will obey my voice and do all our command output none of these diseases upon you has the Egyptians for I am the lord that heal him that healeth thee telling that glory oh my here he is he's seriously sick my baby has got colic or pneumonia and how that we find that that how that God moved down and he healed all the diseases and God kept them perfectly all the way through there were babies that were born along the journey you know sometimes we we skip over the simple things that are laying here in the scripture that pertained to us in our journey is that right because the things of it is is that how we enjoy if friends I believe with all my heart we enjoy the great revelation but if that really doesn't ever come down to where it puts on shoe leather and I'll say it like this you can put it in your lunch box then it's not really fully been revealed but when it's revealed its power is revealed and it comes down into a simple everyday walk with God sometimes we good that's why I think God we need to be reminded of this brother and said there were many babies that were born there were mothers that were in distress when babies were being born Moses this you know crying out this mother she's in distress we're gonna lose her what should we do let me look in the band I am the Lord that healeth thee understand you that sounds like the same prescription over and over absolutely is the same prescription tonight well there were those who fell and broke their leg there were those brother brems said that got pneumonia and he said even when they would come there and they had a sick baby and Moses would tell them and the Lord that healeth all thee he they said here's their response he said thank you doctor Moses will go use it Lord you said you was the Lord that God that healeth the baby we believe notice the promise was given and they had to take that promise and say thank you milord they began to pray and they began to move with that word that was given them for their situation for their need you and I've been given a word the next morning the baby was playing that's it I'm the Lord that healeth thee he now he says there wasn't one feeble crippled or blind that come out of the wilderness with them and you know brother bran would say it like this he said you give me a doctor that had that kind of a reputation give me a doctor you know everybody when they're getting ready they want an you know a new doctor or they want a surgeon and nothing wrong with that you know you don't want somebody say well you're not done my best and they they have killed everybody they operated on I'm doing my best using the way you know what you do your best when maybe we just need to let you practice on dummies you know or something you know but the reality is you want to check you want to make sure this person knows what they're doing let me tell you something he wasn't Moses that established a reputation it was God unfolding his reputation among his children in that hour and brother even in this hour we're living way on the other side of this but God barreled a little body and God declared in this hour to you and I and they ain't gone away from it that is reputation is still the same I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases same prescription I don't have to go to the laboratory what are we gonna do this virus is coming out oh my goodness what are we gonna do quickly somebody and it's just like I was you know here before church a few hours and everybody's so excited that the Australians have come up and been able to you know somehow whatever they do you know formulate that or get the corona virus and now they can be able to make vaccines they're so thankful for that and you know my heart I thought you know how sad it is because now the world it's almost like a relief and you know one person they had a nurse I believe that now has come back after heaven the coronavirus has come back now they they they they they are not no longer with the symptoms or anything like that and they're now back working in the hospital and you think now once you think about it if we could tune in ears how much you had find among people go boy I thought it's gonna be real bad catastrophe boy this is really to have a man thinking this is over hey let's go back to Sinan you understand it's only it's only there's scares and fears but in there wonderful for you and I we can walk in peace I don't know what other virus is gonna come up I don't know a lot of them but it's all taken care of so how taken care of now notice this you know brother Brown I want to read this statement to you he says now concerning that in that I'm the Lord that he lives on that diseases and notice he says here for forty years in the wilderness without was only one medical one prescription I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases and he did it this is something very big he did it because they took him at his word and just set their self free the word brings freedom but just simply taking it well I don't know if I can't about you making it it ain't about you making it it's not your word it's his word he will bring his word to pass through our life it's just to take him at his word and just set ourselves free notice the scripture goes on in Exodus 23 25 and he says ye shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee notice how its worded I will take sickness away from thee sickness comes upon you comes upon me no heal me and he comes and takes it away Deuteronomy 7:15 and the Lord will take away from the all sickness who will the Lord sums 30 verse 2 O Lord my god I cried unto thee and thou hast healed me psalm 34:19 many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out up that's all who does that the Lord does that he acts 10:38 notice here they are in sin in ministering the word they're identifying the working God was present in Christ verse 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him somebody say all not some all his track record is still the same tonight everyone that'll have faith and take him at his word he still is the same tonight because oppression can come in your natural body oppression can come in your spirit in your mind come on now healed all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him just so that somebody here tonight being president would understand this is weeks this was not something here of just recent God knows our need tonight hallelujah Matthew 4:23 and Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people and his fame went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers meaning different types of diseases and torments and those that were possessed with Devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the palsy and He healed them Matthew 8:16 when the even was come they brought unto Him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick verse 17 here it is that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet this is out of isaiah 53:4 saying himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses he was fulfilling that this was not well you know we got away free goes to Calvary no he let it be no I am the Lord that healeth thee I will say I was the same one that was there although in the Old Testament that healed them when they were sick and now that same God is here walking God was in Christ and himself Oh think about it here he took our infirmities you know that took means he reached out and took them paralyzed remember Jesus as a gentleman he was not gonna walk he doesn't walk in he doesn't heal to show his power he's not a show-off but what it was there were hearts that were welcoming him they had needs in their lives and when he walked in I want you to understand this tonight there were needs that they had in their life and all they had to do was have faith in him and when that thing that was bothering there that had been binding them all they had to do is have faith in Him and Jesus walked right in and lifted it he took our infirmities the disease's weaknesses weaknesses of things you realize you would say well I don't have no weakness in my body no there are certain things that go along genetically you know brother Ram talks about an adoption serious he said if God Terry's long enough he said I hope one day you know to be able to come in and you know he said I hope Joseph is here and ministering and everything else and he said and I'll no doubt come in he said with the palsy because all the branham's get the palsy come on now you you've heard that in the message you see brother Branham one ignorant that there are weaknesses that can't abide in our body but we are not going to give in to it I said we're not going to glorify we are not going to set there and like making out an insurance policy say well you know what you know I am starting to feel a little funny you know mama had this and now we've got a promise I am the lord that healeth a you might be the one that God said it's been you that the cycle is going to be broke you might be the one that is the testimony to come forth to say his word has come into that place in my life and I really I don't have to be and live under that that's all in God's hands isn't it oh man what you understand all of this is by faith himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses he just took them and carried him oh my notice the Bible says in Matthew 9 35 and Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people here is to the disciples in Luke 9 6 and they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel healing everywhere you see what Jesus even what we read at the beginning what Jesus wanted them to know is that the word has power in it are you with me he did not want them to rest upon because we are not we know we do not rest upon that will when I pray for the sick they get healed because we realize there's many that can stand in Matthew 24 the Lord you know did not cast out Devils in that all right here they were doing this before the Holy Ghost ever come but how much greater it is when the Holy Ghost has come into that and made alive to a son and daughter of God and the word is there present in their life and for them to be able to stand there in the face of the enemy they're not only living above sin Omaha ver locking in authority above sin and they've got authority over the devil are you with me they went about healing everywhere this before the Holy Ghost came is that right Luke nine men look nine and ten and the apostles when they returned they told him all that had done they had done and he took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called but the setter that the Bethsaida and the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of God and healed them that had need of healing none of that could have been done if they did not have faith they had to have faith listen to me they had needs in their life what we don't read in the scripture but we do know by the teaching of the word is that the Lord Jesus Christ Himself is the one that stimulates by an operation of the Holy Ghost he'll come and stimulate our faith are you with me you see God doesn't say well I'm gonna bypass your faith no he comes to stimulate your faith because the promise is to you are you with me that's why brother Branham could stand on the platform he said that was not my faith he said that was an operation of the Holy Ghost that came to stimulate your faith God has healed you by your faith there's a whole separate part the Lord willing we'll we'll look within those things there but it's faith our own personal faith but we need we need that there's times we need strength from the Lord we need that and that don't mean you're not you're not mud well you're not much for believer that don't mean that at all we need strength sometimes thank God for that jesus said unto them in mark mark 6 for what's this a prophet is not without honor but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house and he could there do no mighty work here's the mighty God think of this this is the mighty God who opened up the Red Sea standing in flesh part of the Jordan this is the mighty God that spoke through Elijah this is the mighty God who spoke through Moses and think of it he could do no mighty work there why because of their unbelief God operates by faith that's why I listen to me now that's why anything that would be contrary or would be a hindrance to your faith at all cast it out whether it's out of your mind or out of your life cast it out get rid of it and then take his word he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and heal them I think brother Branham had just comes to me brother Branham would say it like this and restoration of the bride tree he said quit fighting at it he said let God come and take you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost let God come and take you to your healing let God come and take you to your deliverance he doesn't need our strength to do it he just needs faith in Him is that right as he said did you believe I'm able to do this so he laid his hands on a few sick folk and healed them now notice this here in Matthew 85 you're familiar with this this portion we've administered out this many times but here was the this interior one of the times in the scripture where you had someone come where the word was spoken and their servant was made whole in this here notice in Matthew it's verse 6 of Matthew 8 he said Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented how many know sickness is a torment sickness is a torment it you know sometimes you know spirits can take bodily form a cancers and other things like that and then there's other times it just comes upon the body it is a tor mentor and he was grievously poor minute and Jesus said unto him look at these words I will come and heal him but here the roman centurion said you don't need to come but speak the word speak the word only and my servant shall be healed it was settled God was in Christ it was settled with him that the word that was spoken because he knew what it was to be under Authority he knew the authority of the word that was resting right there just speak the word and my servant will be made whole hallelujah the word going forth notice this how lujah glory be to God in the highest hallelujah I think of who we were and I think I gave this testimony in a prayer meeting if I gave it for a Thursday night then you forgive me for my some timers but there was a there was a young lady that had you know her sister you know they would be the family Reynolds family that we were praying for where the young lady had died in that passed on and that in that car accident her sister had come in the prayer line brother Andrew and I were standing there and you know I didn't know who it was and but brother Andrew knew and and so then brother Andrew was talking to me in that time and then then he calls me late that night and as he had left the meeting and he said can I call you real quick he had got a call we had prayed that God that the Lord would move upon the sisters heart and God would break that fear that was upon her life because after a situation you know how this sometimes when tragic or traumatic things take place things sometimes their knee there has to come that to break that away well you know God was working on both ends because I think she was that night they'd went over to brother Matt Morris's Church for for a meeting as well but it they called back and said that my sister called me and she said I'm free so brother Andrew is wanting to you know to reverse you know if we were to talk about that and and and he said she asked her sister what time was it and the Astra what time that was it was at the same time see God was working God was working it was God who did that very not one person with her whoever was praying whether his brother Matt or whoever it wasn't the man or a person it is God who healed that situation you know when it comes down to show you and I isn't necessary for the flesh to be there what it is is sin the word hallelujah speak the word only you've been given the worse speak to that situation this same Lord Jesus said if I can just step into mark 16 verse 17 in that portion these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover notice it didn't say pray for him he just said lay hands on the sick we believe in praying for the sick but the Prophet would pick that verse up and say see it is the same life but was there in Elijah's bones when they threw the dead man on him that man came back to life he said it is simply the quickening power of God that is in the body of Jesus Christ hallelujah [Music] hallelujah brother Branham reads this scripture here in the message God's provided way of healing what a wonderful message he reads this scripture out of Psalms 103 and he comes into this place bless the Lord verse 2 O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases so a brother Samuel why does it seem like that really tonight we're putting the emphasis on him because that's who it should be put on that's why brother Brandon would say it now he said now look you said every one of you he said I want to look at your pastors your ministers that are standing up here they are standing identifying with this word he said when I'm gone Jesus is not gone you see what the Ministry of Malachi thought it is to identify its hyung going getting a church ready and to identify that the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ is here present among us he's working in his body who forgiveth all thine iniquities remember in marriage and divorce he had some different ones after brother Branham came out of there he was given you know the the pillar fire and allowed him to pronounce how God came down and aligning pronounce that grace because of those false unions and things that had been made in people they had they had they you know they had come into a lot of those situations and things and here they were setting I think of how that brother hankins and I think brother mental Friesen was there in those times people absolutely had bags packed and ready to split their ways because they wanted to be true to the Word of God but grace came in on the scene and said don't you never do it again and teach your children never to do it and remember somebody broke as they spoke up you know brother Ram picked it up in later messages and said I can't forgive sin who can say this they said that same thing to the Lord Jesus come on now well who can who can do this but you see what it was it wasn't brother branham doing it he was given the charge by the word it was what God was saying to his people God just borrowed his prophets body and lips girl repeater god I feel good how about you oh and brother Brahim he closes the book right after he reads this scripture closes it in a message cause provider where healing he said I say tonight this scripture is fulfilled this day in your presence all he says heals us of all of our diseases forgives all iniquities today the word is made manifest today glory be to God think about this here Peter and John walking around the gate called beautiful we were they were walking around here as a lame man he had been lame from his mother's womb this was not even a situation that he had Ahad had come across or this sickness had come into his body this was something that came he from when he came out of the womb but Peter and John said look on us what they were calling him to was to the ever-present reality of the Living God silver and gold have we none he said he was expecting are you with me he was expecting he was sitting there expecting something they took his expectation and put the expectation is something much greater than just a temporal thing come on somebody they put his expectation now in the word and in the name of Jesus Christ raisa the Bible said the man was instantly healed they began to walk and not just walk he began to leap and praise God that got the devil stirred up Bodrum said on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost was poured out the devil didn't even get out of his bed but he said right here the devil got up on the side of his bed and started to pout yes sir you know why because it was that same life in action what he had experienced think about running this was a devil this was a spirit that had this man bound a lameness and think about it all the rumors that had been maybe coming all the way down through hell of the Lord Jesus Christ and to think about it they were they had to heed to the authority of the word that was there they had the backing of the Holy Ghost within their life I think of the situation you know her brother Danny's team and telleth there was a brother who was pastoring in Mexico and they were she was trying to cast out a spirit doing the best that he could do and that spirit wasn't even so he went and he got a picture of a half of the pillar fire in Houston Texas and he pointed that to that light are you catching me he pointed there to that light he said you know what that is and you know what that devil had to recognize that and this is what he said listen to me he said well he said that same message that was brought right here he said I am under that and I am represented by that same God the spirit left Alleluia that is why the Prophet when he would refer to that picture he said God had his picture taken with us hallelujah glory be to God blessed be the name of the Lord they identified that name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they let him know that this is by the name of Jesus Christ through faith in his name was this man made whole many other scriptures I could read but I'm just going to just bring it down here tonight Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 4:15 for we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities our diseases but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need but the Brandon would say it like this closing all he said how when we think about all these things the Great Physician is now present he wants to heal the sick and afflicted he wants to make those who are weary to be strong he wants to make those who are afflicted to be well I'm going to go ahead and read this next part as well because I believe within this here you look at how there should be worship and Thanksgiving in our prayer he said although a great physician as our hearts bleed out we black like that sheep we hear your spirit moving back to us my sheep know my voice and we love to shout thy praises we love to weep in my presence for joy we like to express our feelings to thee because we love you with all that's within our whole soul mind and body loves the Lord and we pray God that you will give us this deeper and deeper continually may it become so real to us that the world will fade and all of its folly then there will be no more thoughts of it it'll fade out into eternity it had a beginning now may it have an end we know it will and now we pray God as we your children stand here making intercession for each other in the name of the Lord Jesus for the infirmities that is in our body caused by sin of the past and of the wickedness of the world and our mortal flesh so subject to all the enemy because it's still sin and we say that the Bible declares unto us plainly the Holy Ghost helps our infirmity and intercession we come to the Father this morning humbly believing that you will make intercession for us now that as we confess our sin and our wrongs and our desires for thee our hearts are hungry to be well so that we can serve and do the work that you would have us to do Granite Lord as your elder would go forth with the anointing to lay hands upon the sick may the spirit come forth healing we ask it through Jesus our Lord as I'm going back over and just reading just just looking at these things and praying I thought as I come upon that part where brother Branham makes a statement for the infirmities of our body caused by sin of the past and of the wickedness of the world and our mortal flesh so subject to all the enemy because it's still sin I thought of that that that statement what would come to my heart when we look at that because we know that that that sickness we know that sin we know that those things that sometimes you know from the past may be what somebody did in their in in their past before the Lord had got ahold of their life maybe their their bearing some effect of that within their body yet their soul is completely sealed and it isn't that God's punishment but I want to just bring you to a point in the scripture that I believe that will help you when Elijah went to the woman in 1st Kings 17 and he spoke to her remember here she had just enough to make one little cake and they were going to die her her and her son was going to half that they were going to die but the word of the Lord rang out you know to see we're in obedience she put the word before anything and when she did that God seeing her heart within that it rang out for that saith the Lord the mill barrel will never go empty the crew savoia shall not fail now this is me personally I don't believe that it was just like flour falling on the ground I don't believe there was oil to running off running out of the crus to her house but I believe every time that she had a need what she had need was there are you with me she didn't have to go somewhere else what she had need up was in her own house and let me just say it like this this was a place that Elijah was abiding in and the Bible said when the boy fell sick and that remember what she said men of God are now come to call my sin to remembrance and Elijah took the boy and remember Elijah wasn't searching for the answer Lord had thou come to bring evil upon this paper and then Elijah as he's looking for the answer God let's see no the answer is in the body are you with me I said the answer is in the body of Jesus Christ and he laid upon the baby and it came to life and this is what's important is because after that was done the closing words out of the widow of Zarephath out of her mouth she said now and knowest that the word of the Lord is in my mouth you see notice it wasn't just that God had given to her what would sustain them and that would carry them through in the fan-in through that of the famine but it was a Ministry of life that God would let her know that my word is greater than your past she was worried about her past she was worried that her past was going to travel her but God let her know my word is greater than your past you say what does that mean you don't have to knuckle down or be subservient to any sickness under that healeth all thy diseases the stand blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah and the Lord that healeth all thy diseases there would be to God hey men and we are convinced that as the word of the Lord will spoke the Bible said when that was spoke to the woman that the mill barrel will shall not fail nor The Crucible the Bible said and that spake the Lord by elijah the word the sustained in the famine came by the mouth of Elisha it was God's word God used the mouth of Elisha to speak it when death came about of sudden tragedy and it was a tragedy that for her the enemy was trying to tie her back to past come on now wonder bring fear and one to try to hold something over her head come on somebody but God let him the word has brought a clearing of everything when the abstract to the title deed has come it clears everything that was ever against you brother Simon what does that come to you've got a right to stand toe-to-toe with the devil and say you're nothing but a liar you're a bluff come on somebody hey man blessed be the name of the Lord what are you doing you're taking that you're taking that tree and casting it in the water that word has already turned our bitter life your bitter life it's turned it into sweetness and that same sweetness in our life there is power there is authority various healing in the name of Jesus Christ you believe that tonight Oh glory be to God blessed be his name hallelujah glory be to God let's pray together tonight just be thee wise but could we just get brothers together sisters together maybe a husband and wife they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I want you to enter in and I want you to pray for that one that you've got your hand on that you're standing right next to you don't know what they might be dealing
