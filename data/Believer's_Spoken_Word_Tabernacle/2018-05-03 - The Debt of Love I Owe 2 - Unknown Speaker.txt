things possible through Jesus Christ we ask it now in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you this evening you'll turn with me to colossians chapter 1 and say it it's good to be back home and we certainly appreciate your prayers while we were way there and in the meetings there in virginia and just had just such a just a wonderful time in the presence of god just to see the continuity of the holy spirit just coming through and you know you you always expect god to move if you don't expect God to move in we're in trouble but nonetheless when he does move and how he moves it still leaves you in all and I'm glad I hope that never I don't ever want that to leave I always want to be expecting but always just to see him move and just such a special way just many many hearts and lives that were were touched and dedicated to the Lord within within the services and so we just we want to say we thank God for that and I Prix certainly appreciate your prayers while we were there and on our way home verse 23 of Colossians 1 when I go back to this reading of scripture Paul said if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which he have heard which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where of I Paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church amen may God bless you mrs. where does your being seated then say it is good I heard that on the announcements good to see brother herb here and then man how the Lord has just touched on our brother and we just want to continue to hold him a prayer and sister kress amen it's good to see you sister amen we want to continue to look here at this scripture and you know I I don't know there's things sometimes that you read within the Word of God and it grips you and yet God has it for a special time or reserved in a certain time and then there's times where the Lord will begin to go through things but then there's always a time there's seasons where God will take things that are very familiar pathways to us but boy they're so precious to us and they're things that God just speaks to us real personal in those times and I believe that's how it is many times you know you might hear a song and it might go through a season in your life you you hear a song and those words really ministered to you and then there can come maybe months years will pass in your life and then all of a sudden that song will come across again you know a certain time and it'll minister to you again even in a month even in a much deeper way than even what it did before but it has a meaning to you by by experiences and I believe that's the same way it is with the Word of God when we're we're looking at this here and and Paul you know he's expressing that the sufferings himself that he was enduring he let it be known he said that these sufferings are for you he wasn't trying to make the people of God feel bad or feel sorry that's not at all what Paul was was getting to but there was a display that was to be lived because when we've looked at this here a few services where Paul could say that truly the signs of apostle were were wrought among you in all patience and then in signs and wonders and so forth it really wouldn't have been as effectual if it had just been signs and wonders and Paul's life would not have been a grounded established life you see the the real effectual part went on when I look at this the message that God has given to us and I I look at statements that brother Branham will make when he'll speak of how that God will even so fix that the nature of the man for that age to catch the people of age and I begin to see that as it travels on down then I begin to see how that brother man will make a statement here in the church age book where he'll speak of how that the example of how that God uses the messenger is an example of what God desires to do for every believer now we understand that within all of us we all have our part in our place you know I I think when brother Branham was he was talking with sister Shikari in him she said brother Branham she said I pray and fast and pray and fast she said and I still can't cast out Devils he said since that one in your part he said your part was to pray and fast God's got somebody else to cast out the devil's you see every one of us have our part within it there there's certain things and begin certain gifts and talents and things that God has so allotted to you that God has not allowed and maybe to another person but that's how God puts it all together and that's for His glory you know when it is God never set up his body and to think of just this term body God never set up his body so then it would just be one man but we know that it is one man and that's the one man Christ Jesus and yet we recognize within it God could have taken each one of them in the book of Acts and I always look at the example with Philip Philip went down and preached the gospel Devils were cast out sick were healed and then God catches Philip away and has him to go on down here to a eunuch one man and he catches him away and you would look at it and you would you know just carnally thinking we would say well why did God take Philip away when these people had not even come to the full depth of the new birth and and been filled with the Holy Ghost but you see God was declaring that this is not a one-man movement this is a body ministry and and you see that's the heart of every messenger and every under messenger like we look at a pepra Titus last week it's the hearts desire is that the body itself would be under the leadership and the direction of the Holy Ghost that was the prophets desire to be able to see this word that this word would take flesh in our lives then it would not just be something that you and I would sit around and we could talk about and and you you could finish this quote and you could say this it wasn't about that at all but the word that has been given to you and I here's a word that was to set our hearts on fire a word to put us in action a word to bring humility a word to bring repentance and put us for it to carry out and finish out this last great comission it's a work of God this is not a work of man it's not a man that's orchestrating and remember many times I'm brother Ram will say said it's not me he said it's I can't do anything he said but I have to wait on him there are many things many different ones that brother Branham he wanted to actually go and see healed he he wanted the ange of the Lord to come over top of him and say yeah I pronounce you're healed one of them you know just by sister Edith right sister Hattie's his sister had his uh sister remember that brother ban talks about how that here she was born with him infant para paralysis and yet how she had so much pain about her life and then brother bam begins to talk about how that he prayed for her and her pain left her but yet she still in that paralyzed condition and how that she continued on in her life and brother Ram he even pours his heart on it said I've wanted to see the Ange of the Lord come above her to where I can say to her he's not and your paralysis is no more he said but see I can't do anything unless he himself is the one who first directs it now sometimes to our human mind our thinking we would look at that and think you know just to the carnal way of thinking that well maybe eat us and meet in more faith but you got to understand this that God's gonna have testimonies all around that there's people that don't have to have everything good and everything just right but they are so in love and in tune with the Lord Jesus Christ till the other things of life take second priority its Christ who is the saves the main and the center priority whether I feel let whether I feel down its Christ no doubt about it with me know with sister Eaters and I look at things like that you know because sometimes we you know can get in our minds a certain way but we it's always important that we keep what we're looking at and we funneled it right through the word and bring it all the way through and I'm so thankful to God in this hour because when I look at the message to me when I see the message it is a very revealing of the very nature of God there's nothing less than that the Prophet told us that when the seals were open he said it would be the very nature of God coming on display and we recognize that to be true it it brought Christ the mighty Conqueror in full view of you and I as the believer and here Paul is standing you know here's Paul to think about this now Paul and his life the sufferings that he had the sufferings that Paul realized that the things Paul seen these things that I'm enduring Paul was letting it if I was letting it be known I really don't have to endure these things I really don't have to suffer I could sit down and there would be no suffering I could be quiet there would be nothing paul was letting in no but the reason that I'm doing it is because he said the burden and the fire that God has put in my heart to carry this gospel and I believe that that's not just something that's confined to Paul or the ministers of the gospel I believe that's that way for every believer you we all must have that same fire and that same burden in that same zeal and that same desire is to see the gospel that the gospel itself would go on if we don't live to the coming of the Lord but at least our life has been a part of the advancement of the gospel of Jesus Christ that's our desire that ought to be our desire every day Lord let me live such a life better little Vance the gospel of Jesus Christ Philip Paul realized that he had he had he'd ever there was a measure of suffering and Paul knew this he knew there was a measure of suffering that was left to him and you know brother Branham picks it up like this and he's talks about how that he's picked up about Johnny Appleseed and most of you know that the real name of that is Jonathan Chapman and there's a lot of things there's museums here in Ohio that's actually wrote about that museums for him and you look at how brother Rams talking about he said how every man he said you know you like to look down through your ministry you like to look down through the times and you like to see seeds that have been sown and you you like to see things that are coming forth you like to see fruit and but then he likens it the same way to the man who was in Sweden and he said there's also a story about a man who lived in Sweden he said to where he went around he liked flowers so he sold flowers seeds and grounds that would take it he said and now after the man has been gone he said but yet them flowers live on so he's talking about things that you know they're seeds there's life there's things that that are done that will will long live after us and he goes on he says that's what we all like to see that's something that we've done that would cause others to benefit by what we have done we want others to benefit by what we have done and I think brother branham he's in this is in this a message here and he's he he goes into a conversation that he and dr. Sam Adair his friend that they have had and brother Branham is is talking about this of how that he said you know I don't know how much longer I've got to live Duncan and and you know the doctor said yeah he said that you you know for his self he said and they begin to talk about how many patients he had seen that morning and brother brems talking about the services and then brother Brown makes a statement and this is where I'll start quoting to you brother brems said the greatest thrill that I that I have is living for others the greatest thrill I have is living for others now tell you our age is not or every any age was never exempt from this but every age itself the pressures every age had pressures every age had pressures there was a spirit for every age and the Spirit of God the only thing that could withstand that spirit that that spirit of the world that characteristic of the age the only thing that could withstand it is the Holy Spirit and God would deliver his life flow to the children of God God is committed to his word and I mean God being committed to his word he will not fail and you and I are a part of that word we become the Express part of it when that life has sought us out and that life has moved on the inside then it's no longer you trying to keep something but it now is the same god that has drawn you living and keeping his word and it's promised through your life it holds you it's an anchor it's a stability that even when we deal with and we fight against the spirit of this age you know the spirit of this age I'm sure probably most of us could recite it by heart it's soft easy live where everything itself that it's always looking you catch people you know I I think we're not when I taught school man you'd catch people sitting around you know after times and they would start thinking about retirement and they had only been teaching ten years I thought this is foolish I mean this is silly man I I mean who in the world wants to even count on that for ten years you might not be able to retire to your seventy what yeah I looked at things like that about what what good does that do just set around like that I'm not putting people down friends but it's such an age where things that you see it they talk about it they talk about I think what is it now the Millennials and things like and they they talk about different ones they say man you can't hardly get them to work and can't hardly to get them to do certain things and they don't want to they don't want to be committed on things like let me tell you what that is that's a spirit of this age there's things that come around there's little things here and there that has actually been seeds that's even been set in for this time seeds that have been sown way on back but in the midst of it all I believe that what God has said in his word that God never had to put a footnote and said this will apply except when it gets too hard but I believe with all my heart that the same Holy Ghost that moved on the prophets and moved on them to write it I believe that he is still in the heart of the believer manifesting himself has the triumphant Christ in the midst of the darkness in the midst of the oppression he still declares that he himself is the one who has spoke that word and he keeps that word he'll fulfill it in our lives I believe that was on my heart I believe that life itself then we come across you know when we look at life itself there ain't nothing easy about life get your grass mowed today where don't try it today it was wet outside but getting mowed the other day guess what it'll be ready for you in a few days oh the grass is green enough in nothing in this life ever comes to a place to where it's just set there's a constant constant going on it's in this life that we have no continuing City you buy a car now you wait a few years and rest spots come in it right you buy a house and whatever more build a house whatever it is you you go and you do all of that and yet they're a little give it time and there will be things that you have to do it don't matter how much and I think it's something that's good for us to take care of those things but we understand that life itself it's not meant to be easy but relieved and goes on this says it like this he says that's what life is and what makes life real not what you can do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others see that's when you're really living and if there happens to be someone among us who has never did that try to live for somebody else give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life now remember what how we were looking at that last week in that day at Calvary blue brand was monitoring us that we must remember that we are sons of God that he immodest us by the Spirit of God to live for those not just for those that's easy to live for but live for those as he said that man who would hate you or that man who would kill you are living for them and why he said to live for them is so that you might redeem them good over to be to God you know sometimes there's a lot of things that you got to hear and I don't mean gotta hear but sometimes there's things that you have to kind of be able to weed through and wait through a lot of different things there's a lot of words that can be said a lot of things that just like a lot of smokescreen but I tell you this right now will never get anywhere with God by trying to live for ourselves if we go to brain and all of our problems on that the reason I am the way I am is because brother Joshua is the way is that is nonsense that is a cop-out and a compromise you are what you are in the decisions that you make because you make those decisions come on somebody if we've got the power of the Holy Ghost on the inside then don't tell me that somebody else has got greater authority if I'm not giving myself to the Holy Ghost something's wrong come on friends you see this is an age it's repeated that you know it's an age that well you know brother Joey did this so I did this and that that's nonsense it ain't because I'm doing this because brother Joey did this there's every man let every man take accountability for his own actions are you with me yeah it's if it comes to that place and that's where the living for others you know even where if somebody says something that ruffles your feathers it still comes to a place to where you're not living for your feathers but you're living for that or the person you just say Lord help my brother Lord help my sister Lord I'm talking about somebody who's anchored let me tell you something in order to endure tests and trials you got to be anchored you got to be anchored you've got to be anchored in the Lord Jesus Christ to where that any nothing else matters and you're able to have that discernment to catch those things and say you know what this is trying to sort and stunt my growth I will not and I refuse to have any part in it but as Samuel how is that suffering hey suffering is also coming and bringing the word that brings it right to the attention glory be to God you'll find that it's more blessed than riches that can be thought of what you can do for someone else to make life's burdens now this ain't about what making what's easy for me and what's easy for you you know this ain't about you give me your old raggedy shirt because you're getting ready to take it to the goodwill but saying I was just thinking of you you was not come on somebody this ain't about what things are easy for us this was not easy for Paul this was a part of living out the gospel which life in itself is a burden he will make it a light a light a little lighter for someone else you just don't know the joy unless you tried it once to do something for someone else brother BAM goes on in another message here faith in the Son of God let me just read this before we move on in he said each day I want to live not for myself if I live for myself I live a selfish life you know you can go to praying about something a need that you have in your life and we know the word we know how we're beckoned ask the father anything of my name and I'll do it but I believe there's witnesses in here just besides me that has found that the more that I brought up my need the more silent it's become anybody else are found that but when I go to start forgetting about my need and start praying for the other means now I'm telling you I pray for the other needs report for the church but I'm talking about friends where it comes to a place to where I do want to get something from God in this service don't you but at the same time I want to be able to set in such a place to where there's an atmosphere that's created to where if God only brings a little my way I hope he feels the other brothers sister that has a need God fill them with a dumptruck of it Lord God for what they have need of because we're here NEADS because it might be your prayer when there's something that that other person is going through but yet as you're sitting there and you're praying and you're looking to God you watch God come by and not only will that need to be met but you'll find your answer for your need comes right down you see if we're not careful within our lives we've become self-centered and the gospel is not about self-centered the gospel is Christ centered and with being Christ centered his body it takes precedence over us because his body we we want to make sure that we're looking for his body this is what Paul is talking about that fill up the sufferings for his body sake the church well recognize that this suffering and that was taking place for the body was for the glory of God and this suffering was for Christ if I live for myself I live a selfish life I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of God remember how brother Bram talked Joe told us about the thought Aaron AIDS was such a dark age and how God commended the believers in that age in such a time of Darkness but yet it is so well spoken of where God recognizes their work and labor of love but RAM tells us he said no it was so dark the believers in that time he said they labored even the more fervently he said their labored this is what he said he said their labor was not for Paul but their labor was for Christ who had been revealed and made manifest through the ministry of Paul so you see they had become in contact with that living Christ and here they were though the darkness was so great but they were labored that much more fervently now I look here in the time it's always about building the kingdom of God if we can just keep that that term and that thought it's about building what I do is it building is it building the kingdom of God I tell you that's one that's one thing that you'd look at with with brother Branham in this hour that was his desire was to build the kingdom of God if there's anybody that could have had a millions and billions a a billion dollar ministry he could have he could have taken the God the gift that God entrusted him with and used it for his own means but I want you to think about it even when he was laying there on that Texas Highway he said it's not for me I tell you that's the kind of life that brought this gospel I believe with all my heart that I'm looking at and I'm one of them of people who have that same kind of heart it's not because of some good breeding that we had in our life we had a great up ring no that's not what it is it's because that we were ordained and planted in this bed of time and when this word is reached down into our life you're willing to sell out everything and delay hold on that pearl of great price it means more to you than anything else hate to tell you the truth I could probably many of you in here would have never darkened the church church door you've seen so much hypocrisy and things down through the years and other things like that but what was it that got your attention not a church what got your attention was Jesus Christ being manifested by the promise of his word hallelujah he shipped that promise in front of you and I and it spared you and I to a place to say that I can help that same resurrected Lord Jesus Christ I believe I'm a part of that glory be to God here's Paul Maya in acts 18 Paul here I made have to skip a few verses to get to some places but I want you to watch how Paul here he is God using Paul in acts 18 one he departs from Athens and he comes to Corinth it goes on here let me just skip over verse 2 and verse 3 and verse 4 and go to verse 5 the Bible said when Silas and timotheus were come from Macedonia Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ here was Paul in the synagogue for a period of time but yet he had not turned loose yet here is all this that was bottled up within him to testify that Jesus was the Christ but there came a moment where the spirit itself pressed him and said testify of it now there's no doubt about it Paul was going through prophecies in the scriptures with him then to see how God so arranges everything and I I don't want to dwell so much on that but notice in verse 6 the Bible says when they opposed themselves these were the Jews and blaspheme he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your heads I am clean from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles and he departed fence and entered into a certain man's house named justice one that worshipped God whose house joined hard to the synagogue this guy was in a dangerous place justice was in a dangerous place his house joined hard to the synagogue is right there and here Paul finds refuge finds comfort in this man's house this man worships God now think about how God has all this placed here Paul goes into this house and then he goes on to say how that Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue lived on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized now think now directly the Jews themselves were withstanding this gospel I mean when you would express the gospel to somebody you're not there the joy that you have is not somebody rejecting it your desire is that they would come to that same knowledge to that same place and that they themselves would come to know him has the Living God so to think about this here is Paul now what you think of this every turn was not a turn where as soon as Paul spoke people were turning to the Lord you know contrary to that there were many places that Paul spoke that they would try to stay tried to kill him there were times when then how that it would be known among the Brethren they would let him down in a basket they weren't comfortable he wasn't being let down in a Ford Lincoln basket than ever say it wasn't comfortable and think about it think about how that maybe that could have even been thought to the coward to the to the mind why Paul he's cowardly if he's a man of God he just oughta storm right out the gate and what but see God leads his children God leads his children he knows exactly what to do glory be to God you see within it here I wonder how Paul was in the midst of this time no doubt Paul would have you know been ready to depart after so long a time but notice in verse 9 I love this scripture that goes into this then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by vision be not afraid glory know that Paul was afraid be not afraid God knows just out to address what's going on be not afraid but speak and hold not buy peace for I am with thee and no man shall set on me to hurt thee for I have much people in this city notice I have much people in the city to look at that city you wouldn't think nothing much it was such a city of debauchery and so much of a city of such violent and Citra ass in the city because this was a major trade route there was all sorts of things that you can read in the scripture even where Paul would speak to the believers and say some of you were effeminate some of you were abusers of yourself with mankind and somebody blowing down the whole list of things he said but you and justified but you've been sanctified you've been filled with the Holy Ghost what was it people who were in this city it would have been easier for Paul to have left but he stayed in this city mind you Paul was not receiving anything from the church when Paul was here he labored with his own hands as a tentmaker he could even bring it back to them and say look I have labored among you with my own hands now there's no doubt about it that other churches Paul makes it clear through this letters to the Corinthians that there were other churches that God would actually use through those things to supply the needs that were there within Paul's life but yet when you look at it why is it here in Corinth that Paul would have to work with this hands no doubt about it when you see how that God will have a testimony because when those false apostles begin to come among and false brethren those brethren were trying to bring all kinds of accusations against Paul but Paul could take the Corinthians right back to the word and say when did I ever try to profit off of you when did I ever try to make gain out of you so you got to be careful people try to gain your mind people try to gain your affections people try to gain and draw you and there's only one side that we need to stay on and that's the side of the word is that right this is the side that we must take on I'm telling you what's the truth when a voice comes and wants to present things as though there are sides to be taken that is clearly where we need to stand with discernment and recognize that's the old tongue of the devil because there's only one sad that you and I should ever be found on and that's the side of the Lord Jesus Christ not on the sides we're not here to take sides glory be to God it always amazes me because we talk about the deep mysteries of God and yet the prophet who had assert this right in the midst of Christ the mystery of God revealed very very simple directions that he would give to us as the Church of the Living God and yet what a powerhouse message it that message itself is a very unfolding of that seventh seal of Christ within your life but if you're not careful things can hinder that expression so Paul could bring it back to tell to ask the Corinthians you see God will have certain things to be done a certain way that no doubt Paul could not even fathom why he was doing what he was doing he just knew that I must labor with my hands here it didn't matter I wonder did Paul I wonder did Paul that he study differently for the Corinthian church I wonder if Paul did Paul's give himself more to the ephesian church well let me say it like this we've Paul was singing specials would Paul only sing on Sundays or we're pulsing on Thursdays too if Paul was studying to bring a message would Paul say I'll wait till Sunday or would Paul preach on Thursdays too you see it didn't matter if this was not about what was convenient he was doing this for the body watch how Paul here it goes on to say in verse 11 and he continued there a year and six months teaching the Word of God among them Paul goes on and he mentions this in Ephesians 3:1 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles nopal was a prisoner of jesus christ but how Paul would disclose this he said I'm a prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles so this was not just something that paul was serving god just because of the gentiles but paul he recognizes his position he recognizes his responsibility as he goes on in through the the scriptures that go on further past this when he talks about the mystery of christ that this has been committed unto me now in this being committed to him it's evident in verse 13 of Ephesus Ephesians 3 that the people could see the sufferings and hear these things for he said wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory so Paul's very careful he's letting them know know and the focus is not about my tribulations the focus is not so where that you say oh my Paul oh my don't you guys just feel terrible for for Paul Paul's letter no I don't want you to faint for my tribulations these are for your glory how would it be for their glory because Paul the suffering that was coming his way yet the very revelation of Jesus Christ that mystery was being dispensed in that hour to the believers but listen not just a message that was given out but the people could look and what they were hearing they were seeing that this is a man but not only can dispense or minister but he's got an anchor in his life he's established tribulation can come his way but look where he remains see that's a great witness you see we can talk about all the mysteries we can talk about the message we can talk about all those other things but where is your life is your life rooted and grounded and established who him N where is it at it must be established I tell you what the Prophet tells us very very clearly he said how do we win our loved ones he said you be loyal to what you believe he goes through and tells us even about on the applying of the token how to apply that token applying in love applied in consideration said an atmosphere he said that they'll fall into it showing to us that this word it's an application this listen it minutes not just words and letters this is the literal life of Jesus Christ amen the presence of God is not just something that's confined to this building but the presence of God he'll come down and meet with us but let me tell you something he desires to be effectual in your life daily that's his desire watch out Paul goes on here with Corinthians I'm gonna move to the second Corinthians Paul was talking about how that the people he says in verse 3 first second Corinthians one blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all comfort who comforted us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer so those moving under that word and letting the word have preeminence in their life they have a consolation by seeing what that word how it stands and it holds in the life of Paul if it's there in their heart listen if it's there in their heart nobody's going to take it out of their heart but you see what a comfort it is to be able to look and say it held the same God that held all the same God will hold me these Corinthians could say hey listen Paul didn't put god somewhere else but he brought God down to a reality but it's God inside of us they could recall remember how Paul the messenger told us that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost remember how he declared to us that it's God's desire to dwell inside of us so they realized God wasn't far out here they realized God was with them so you know what I could do when they would look at that word that could take comfort and rest within the same word that was strengthening and had anchored them because they went through the sufferings like Paul went through remember Paul speaks to the Thessalonica Church and he says you also suffered of your countrymen just like others have done and just what they've done to you is the same thing they did to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he's letting them know that that life that is held that held him as the sacrifice is the same life that's holding you Oh glory be to God can't wait to get there on that day and even meet some of these folks verse 7 and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall you be also of the consolation wait a minute our hope of you is steadfast who's he talking to is there must be the Ephesian Church must be the Galatian Church no this is second Corinthians I hope any of you is steadfast you see where pulse confidence was in the word his confidence was in that word that that word would be able to take such an effect within the hearts of the believers and bring maturity to their life did he have to speak to things within their lives that was showing signs of immaturity I'm of this one I'm of this one I'm about one I'm with this one and Paul let it be known this kind of division and childish stuff Paul knew they needed to mature but the way to mature is to bring a word not only the corrects but a word that will bring maturity and so Paul when he's looking at a steadfast hope he's not having a confidence in their flesh but it's a confidence in the word that he can have a witness you have received that word glory be to God he could even tell this same church you are the seal of my Apostleship glory be to God he didn't say that to any other Church but here he took a chance that it would look like they'll never make it they'll never this they'll never that but God let me show you I don't call the high and falutin things of this world but I call the weak and the poor and those that are the outcast but I do that that I might make know my glory that this is not a man but of the power of Almighty God hello God don't care what your strings are in your family God don't care hold the sin that's down through your family tree you are a part of another tree Alleluia if the facts of that tree can come down what about when we have been born in that tree of life then that strain of predestination can move down in our life and we can begin to look at that and say that's who I am that's what I am that's what I can expect the works that I do shall you do also hallelujah I'm talking about that tree oh my grow to be to God the branch gift to verse 12 for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience then in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God we had our conversation in the world and more abundantly - you word they had a Paul there was a character that was on display you with me Paul was not just carrying a message it was a character from we write none of the things unto you than what you rhetoric knowledge and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the endless in this verse and yes also you have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus Paul said we're your rejoicing where are your rejoicing and you are our rejoicing they could say hello your honor I'm so glad they didn't mistake Paul for Jesus but they are thankful to God Lord thank you for the messenger thank you that he was willing to count lord thank you that he was willing to go lord thank you for this word this message that has United us with you that delivered us out of the oppression of Corinth Lord Thank You Lord God thank you for this word lord thank you that you sent this word to our way oh they were saying in that day we're resting on that revelation Paul that's you bought and Paul could say on that day you will be our rejoicing amen the word came and the word produced oh my Paul goes into here in Philippians 1:21 for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain I want you to watch this for a moment we're familiar with that scripture aren't we for me to live is Christ and to die is gain Paul was letting it be known by this scripture if I'm gonna live it's for Christ if I die it's gain because I go into the presence of God so he Lenape know my living here is not gonna be about me pause lenden know I've already lost sight of me matter fact Paul said even in the scriptures I believe above this or the chapter that follows it where Paul could say I seek to apprehend that which I'm apprehended of Paul let it be known that my eyes are on the prize glory be to God but if I live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor yet what I shall choose I want not for I am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you the jury I don't know I don't know if it was something that was so put before Paul within this very moment but it really lays it out in Scripture were Paul knows that if he were to die and slit beyond he would be gain it places it here within the scripture as though that that Paul himself he has a choice do I go or do I remain but look where Paul places it he didn't say it's more needful for me to be here because there's things that I still want to do in life but he said the reason that I want to remain it's needful for you it had to be something within Paul's heart that let him know there's more to be done I always think when I was over there that night in the prints of God came in that room we were praying back there in February of 99 with my dad and you know death was rolling in on that time when he was there on that table we were praying there you know the testimony and how the Lord began to speak him and the one thing my dad was talking in the room at that time he was just praying and you know he said you know I he said what a great consolation it was to know in that in that hour he said but when he began to ask where were you when you were praying and we told him I said well we'll just ride on down the hallway just his way he said that's the direction he came to me from and he came to me and said your work is not finished here yet but you shall go back and the think about it I tell you what my mom knows everyone when when my daddy wouldn't be on the curtain of time I was just a boy he had that he had that that part with with the ear when he had to had that eardrum worked on my daddy was never the same after that never the same he wanted to go my mom can tell you that he came back and for for I don't know how long it was he just it's like this life like held nothing my brother Sam you say what about the church oh no he gave his life for the church he gave his life for the church he gave his life for this but it was it was a desire for him to go what had been so real let me think about it what did brother Branham say here he is laying here his body laying there on the bed next to sister meeting and brother Branham coming back through those lines said do I gotta go back in that old pest house do I got to go back there you see it's something that had so moved upon Paul that Paul said it's needful that I come back among you having this confidence look at this in verse 25 I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith for whose furtherance for theirs furtherance their joy of faith that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again that your rejoicing in Jesus Christ might be more abundant brother rap goes on I just don't have time to to quote it but brother bream goes in to talk about in thinking man's filters right towards the end of it but the brem says this statement over and over within here it's about five times he says that how easy it would be for me he makes a statement over and over how easy it would be for me just to sit down and not preach he said it would be easy because I wouldn't have to take the bruises I wouldn't have to take wounds I wouldn't have to get cut he said and I would be just as save and have just as much eternal life as the man preaching he said how easy it would be for me he said instead of being troubled and not being able to sleep and and praying over the different things how easy said it would be for me just to be able to get my gun and go hunting in the rod and go fishing he says this over and over to thinking man's filter but he says how easy it would be said but fell my lot you understand this was not something that he was made to do even when he was getting ready for tried to alter of what God had ordained for him to do but he was going to alter it to the ways that he wanted to do it y'all know what I'm talking about when he developed that complex right he was going through and making all these things because of what he had what had been developed but she's noticed this God never made that decision for him God simply let him know if you take this direction in your life this is what's going to happen oh brother Samuel it was impossible for him to do it then you got God playing games he could have made that decision but you see friends this is where it shows there's something greater and deeper when the purpose of God is laying there in their life that purpose cannot be defeated God pulled back the curtains and let him see but he still had to make the decision I'm glad he made the decision that he made hallelujah Amen I'm a product of this message it's come it broke the darkness away from around my life oh my it'll cost you things you know that even your stand on the word will cost you people will say things that got me listen friends they don't mean it to be bad it's misunderstood they thought Jesus was against the law Jesus wasn't against the law they thought Paul was against the law Paul wasn't against the law Paul himself wrote very clearly yay now the law is established but notice how Paul would go on and write this here right let me just let me read just let me read just a few verses here brother Brian go to Philippians 2:16 let me just cut out some of this what's where Paul keep this thought in mind they're rejoicing he says holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain yay and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith I joy and rejoice with you all this word offered up means a drink offering that's been poured out if my life has been poured out for your service Paul said I rejoice I joy what's the sufferings this is not you can see within these verses of Scripture here is one so lost in Christ it's not about him and yet this was not something that was just handed to Paul but Paul spoke to you and I and made it very clear in the book of Corinthians I protest by your rejoicing I die daily the secret of this right here was Paul's willingness to die daily I wonder how many scriptures could be wrote about places that Paul maybe perhaps didn't want to go wasn't convenient but Paul had been in such a place you understand what I'm saying you can't make you cannot make Paul and the other men and put them on as idols as though they never had don't you let the devil do that to you as though they never had their trials and their tests and they never don't you let the devil do that to you that's an idolatry but these were these were men that Paul could say we were thin without we had fear we're even to trust in themselves he said we had the sentence of death in ourselves these were individuals that as Paul could died to himself that God could lead him and direct him so much to a place to where Paul could say I go bound in the spirit he wasn't looking at his earthly bonds he was looking at I'm spiritually bound to the will of God that this is my desire I want to serve and please him this is the dead of love I oh this is the dead of love that you will wield all mine for this same cause also do you joy do you do you joy and rejoice with me let's just stop we bryan script down to that second Timothy chapter two verse eight look where Paul says this here verse eight remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer this is they sought to be glad tidings of peace but him preaching this he suffered trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of God is not bound therefore I endure all things for the elects sake Paul what about you oh no it's not about me it's not about me it's about him and his people I endure all things for his elects sake that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory you know here brother branham make this statement he said our redemption wasn't a cheap thing he said this message to bring it wasn't easy I tell you friends it's not it's not become easy I hope you understand what I'm saying it wasn't easy for him to bring it how many times her brother Brad would say I know what I'm saying I'm gonna lose friends and yet why did he say it not to lose friends he said it to be obedient to the Lord aren't you glad I'm glad but even in that if it was not easy to bring this message than to think about it even in the day that we're living in it's not easy to live it I'm not talking about because you don't have the life on the inside it's easy to live it from with on the inside but there's it's in complete complete objection to the very society that we live in the standard of the word it's not it's not everybody going along with it not everybody patting you on the back and the sad thing about it is it's not just out there but it can get right around in the ranks of our message but it's worth it I said it's worth it it's worth it to follow the Lord Jesus Christ it's worth it to let this word have preeminence it's worth it to see the token applied and expressed in our life it's worth it our heart our life says the dead of love gladly Lord it's not the popular opinion or popular thought of the day but it's you it's what my soul has longed for oh don't you love him let's give everything we've got to him let's give everything with God if you haven't sold out completely sell out completely to him and even here tonight even to look down in your life and say lord I owe my all to you everything if you've let things get in your mind or things get in your spirit or things crowd into your heart say Lord Jesus cleanse me Lord I purged that out cast that aside I want you to half full preeminence you see friends you can tell what you've been given to about where your meditation is the devil will try to fill your mind in your heart with things to meditate on he's always there to try to point out bad and try to point out negative but remember look to the Lord he is faithful within all of this there's no way that Paul could have went through the things he went through without having the anchor in his heart and without applying what he spoke to you and I when he said to you and I consider him who endured contradiction of sinners lest you be weary and faint in your mind but look unto Jesus who's the author and finisher of your faith glory be to God this was a testimony Paul could leave the Corinthian church one of his last few words that he left them in the closing chapter of second Corinthians he was able to declare that among you he says I've sought only to edify the Church of the Living God let that be our heart to edify His Church edified that doesn't mean pumping one another up with all kinds of flowery things but to edify his church means that each and every one of us stands like a gatekeeper and we stand right here faithful to the Word of God and say Lord Jesus I won't let nothing cross into my heart if there's things that want to comes to my ear that's not edifying I've been able to speak to the brother or sister and say this is not edifying but I'll tell you what we'll do we'll go to prayer about it give me your hand right now and let's pray you see friends that only end a lot of things if we can take it to the Lord in prayer the dead of love I Oh fill up the afflictions that are left behind oh god help us tonight your loving he's the same God he's the same God let's pray Heavenly Father Lord your word is so rich to our hearts Lord it's challenging it challenges our lives a little God to such depth Lord like Paul when we read about this and we see Paul's life we realize Lord that Paul could write about the maturing the trials the character Paul could write about the things that you saw within the faith of a man James on the other hand would write about the works that would testify of the faith that lay within the man and yet Lord how Paul could recognize and in no way was he trying to draw the church in a manner to where the church would feel sorry for him where they would be faint as a matter of fact he gave such direction but Lord the proof was that when tribulation when test when trials when things got hard Paul didn't just skirt and flee but he had an anchor that was able to hold him Lord Jesus when we see the scriptures where it says being partakers of your sufferings we realize the Lord to be a partaker is as we looked at it Lord some Thursday's ago is to go through something to go through and Lord Jesus you have seen us through every test in every trial Lord God you who's seen us through your seeing mr. Lord God here tonight I don't know what the needs might be and I know that we can take such a consolation as we look into the Word of God and truly Lord we can look at it and see the great things that Paul suffered the things that he went through and how Paul would express that his striving was according to your might your power that was striving mightily in him or God as Paul was dying daily these scriptures that we read tonight oh god what we don't see but yet we know was there in the quiet times in the times of prayer that father where Paul himself was dying to self and he was dying that you might be glorified lord help us help us Lord that our lives would be like this this life this kind of a life you had an example in this hour your God our prophet your servant our messenger Lord God as he came to bring this gospel as a you and I the gospel that was not popular it was not easy by the way of the way that the world it was not easy for him to stand there but he stood there by the love of God in his heart Lord that's the same in our lives standing by the love of God standing by that same love taking residency in our hearts lord help us lord help us not to get our eyes or our attention on the wrong things help us Lord God we understand there's gonna be misunderstandings there'll be things that will come around there'll be things that are said there's actually as your prophet just reading in Lord here today where he said each and every one in the kingdom of God every son and daughter of God has always had to deal with accusing Lord help us help us your God to look beyond those things lord help us to have our eyes focused on you Lord for it's you that we're living for if we're living for you and living to please you then Lord God you give us the strength to be able to live pleasing to be able to suffer or god help us Lord father I prayed tonight be with your children Lord be with each and every one your God every need that's here Lord may they see that father that the suffering and everything it's not in vain may Lord God from within our hearts seeing the responsibility Lord help us Lord in our homes our families on the job and here in the assembly Oh God be glorified Lord Jesus I'm three Granite Lord Father we want to stand we want to stand with our hearts desire is to see your body edified help us Father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ he men even god bless you if you like to stay you're more welcome to him with branching that's always [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] for calm [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] learning [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] I [Music] me [Music] [Applause] thirty-two you know [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh ow [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] not true the way smooth [Music] strange [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] see maybe and change [Music] [Music] [Applause] I bless your name [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the true ah your day [Music] [Applause] [Music] something died down [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jiji [Music] [Music] I [Music] you [Music] [Music] eh ah yes I play your name oh Jesus is away maker Jesus he's away maker Jesus [Applause] [Music] away maker one day made a way for me when I was startin dreams please stay man the answer my one day well one day Sun refused to shine starting heart of mine late night and day he would make Oh oh I do Letty heard my friend [Music] that day away [Music] Jesus get away for me [Music] is away me cooking [Music] made a way for me when I was starting three answer my way Oh Jesus the waymaker Jesus one day for me dancer Hey for me [Music] halleluyah halleluyah you know him to be away maker hallelujah he still parks the Red Sea he still opens the Jordan hallelujah he's still the same God hallelujah and you know what that's why he allows some of the same circumstances and things to arise it may not look exactly just exactly like the Red Sea but you know it's something that you can't go through but he'll manifest himself in your trial in your test that he's the same God oh ma it's no Marvel when we're on the mountain but oh what grace it is when we're in the valley but all thank God for His faithfulness aren't you glad amen hallelujah god bless you tonight we're gonna let you be dismissed in the name of the Lord amen shake hands with one another as you're being dismissed [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] salvation it's powerful holy ghost ninja's one [Music] homemakers is genuine well it's it's outrageous man this whole ego well salvation I didn't that's illegal [Music] turn your key [Music] sake it's down we're gonna pray do a stereo down down on a pray till we tear your fingers down I heard from him say st.
