[35:06] turn right into the word in Genesis
[35:07] chapter 28 verse 12 it's so good to be
[35:13] in the house of the Lord tonight and
[35:17] just expecting good things from him
[35:22] anything wonderful to have an
[35:24] expectation it really is it's wonderful
[35:28] to have an expectation verse 12 and
[35:35] let's just read a few verses of war they
[35:39] stop there verse 12 and he dreamed and
[35:41] behold a ladder set upon the earth and
[35:44] the top of it reached to heaven and
[35:46] behold the angels of God ascending and
[35:49] descending on it and behold the Lord
[35:51] stood above it and said I am the Lord
[35:54] God of Abraham thy father and the god of
[35:58] Isaac the land were on thou liest to
[36:01] thee will I give it and to thy seed and
[36:05] thy seed shall be as the dust of the
[36:07] earth and thou shalt spread abroad to
[36:09] the west and to the east and to the
[36:11] north and to the south and in thee and
[36:14] in thy seed shall all the families of
[36:17] the earth be blessed and behold I am
[36:20] with thee and will keep thee in all
[36:23] places whether thou goest and will bring
[36:26] thee again into this land I will not
[36:28] leave thee until I have done that which
[36:31] I have spoken to the earth I want to
[36:35] just go for go into a word of Prayer and
[36:39] I know we have been praying for sister
[36:44] Elizabeth Collins and
[36:46] brother Chuck had just sent me this text
[36:49] here just before coming and this is what
[36:52] brother Chuck had mentioned he says well
[36:55] things could be better they brought in a
[36:57] social worker for the family to talk to
[36:59] us about comfort care but we are still
[37:01] believing but in other words the doctors
[37:04] are giving up hope they did not give us
[37:08] a good report they are saying she is too
[37:10] weak to do a lung transplant she weighs
[37:12] 101 pounds the doctors are not sure what
[37:15] more they can do they are watching her
[37:18] mo hemoglobin levels to see if she is
[37:20] losing any more blood she is a true hero
[37:23] she said she's not done fighting yet
[37:25] please keep praying that the Lord will
[37:27] show his glory through this great vessel
[37:29] of Elizabeth that she is awaiting for
[37:32] his mighty touch amen Lord Jesus Christ
[37:35] is the healer the author and finisher of
[37:38] our faith so I wrote back to brother
[37:41] Chuck and I let him know that even we
[37:43] would have special prayer here tonight
[37:45] how many believes God is not just more
[37:54] than Abel but he's the ever-present God
[37:57] and this is a very very very pressing
[38:02] need that is here and no matter you know
[38:04] we're not disappointed in the doctors
[38:06] we're not disappointed doctors can only
[38:09] do what they can see when we step back
[38:14] from this we recognize that even in the
[38:17] midst of our lives
[38:19] brother venom tells us he says
[38:21] concerning his own life he said when my
[38:23] purpose on earth is finished then I want
[38:27] to go you just didn't say I'm ready he
[38:29] said I want to go because we're here for
[38:32] purpose so knowing this year God is
[38:36] overseeing all of this it was sister
[38:38] Elizabeth's life and so with all of that
[38:41] in mind I make those statements because
[38:44] it we are aware that God is over this
[38:47] whole situation
[38:48] God is over all this situation there is
[38:52] and there is not in any way when we
[38:55] doctors are looking they try all their
[38:57] things they're looking at all that and
[38:58] they can only do what God has given them
[39:00] the ability to tap into but God is
[39:03] greater God is greater God not only can
[39:06] do a lung transplant but God can totally
[39:09] create new life amen
[39:13] God is able to raise levels amen this is
[39:17] the God that we serve the God of
[39:19] paradoxes
[39:21] amen amen
[39:24] so let's let's go before the Lord and a

[43:52] here tonight and just ask that God would
[43:57] just give us a real Solomon direction by
[44:02] his Spirit I want to I want to speak to
[44:06] you tonight on the thought that I have
[44:11] is recognition and affirmation
[44:16] recognition and affirmation of blessed
[44:19] assurance so we must recognize we must
[44:26] recognize and then we must also affirm
[44:29] what God has said and what we want to
[44:34] look at tonight is blessed assurance
[44:38] certainly we realize that our our
[44:41] salvation is not and has never been up
[44:46] in the air it's it's not something that
[44:52] is conditional in terms of that reliance
[44:58] upon man but I want to draw your
[45:01] attention here tonight as we move into
[45:03] this here in the word of how that we
[45:07] find that God makes known by grace a
[45:11] ladder an access to Jacob and he
[45:16] declares himself the scripture says
[45:18] there in verse 13 that the Lord stood
[45:20] above it and he declared himself that I
[45:23] am the Lord God of Abraham
[45:25] my father as we've been mentioning here
[45:30] for some time I've dealt with this quite
[45:34] extensively in another in another place
[45:36] but this part here I am the Lord God of
[45:41] Abraham that father Abraham in the
[45:44] natural is Jacob's grandfather but God
[45:49] is laying a distinction that Abraham is
[45:54] your father Jacob so it's not making a
[45:59] natural this is not a natural connection
[46:02] here this is a spiritual connection
[46:06] jacob is aware of the covenant aware of
[46:09] these things but now here is a spiritual
[46:12] connection for God to make himself known
[46:16] and I'll say it in this manner that his
[46:19] revelation how God reveals himself he
[46:23] doesn't change when God reveals himself
[46:26] he will reveal more of himself but the
[46:31] revelation of him and who he is is
[46:34] unchanging so it's an unchanging as God
[46:38] is revealing himself to Jacob here it's
[46:41] an unchanging revelation and it's still
[46:43] holding the original promise it's the
[46:46] same unconditional covenant because it's
[46:51] not a covenant that can be done away
[46:53] with the first covenant could be done
[46:56] away with and it was because it was
[46:58] solemnly based just upon what man if man
[47:02] was able to keep his part up so that
[47:05] covenant was dissolved because man was
[47:07] not able to keep his part up so here God
[47:10] sets forth in a foundation this is an
[47:13] unconditional covenant and notice in in
[47:17] verse 7 of Genesis 17 here is God making
[47:21] himself known to Abraham and here is
[47:25] God's God's promise I will establish my
[47:29] covenant between me and thee and thy
[47:33] seed after thee in their generations for
[47:38] an everlasting covenant
[47:39] to be a god unto thee and to thy seed
[47:42] after thee so God is letting it be known
[47:47] to Abraham that this covenant is not
[47:51] going to pass when you pass but this
[47:56] covenant is a covenant that in every
[48:00] generation of thy seed I will establish
[48:04] this covenant that is between you and I
[48:08] I will establish it with thy seed I will
[48:12] be a god unto you and I will also be
[48:15] unto thy seed after thee now we know
[48:19] that this was not just something that
[48:21] was just haphazardly given but yet we
[48:25] find that when this is revealed to
[48:28] Abraham it doesn't cause Abraham to go
[48:30] into a manor of just well God's going to
[48:34] see to it God's going to bring it to the
[48:36] sea but you find that when God reveals
[48:40] and speaks to a person's life they
[48:42] become perseverant in the promise that
[48:45] God has given that's that's the reason
[48:48] God would reveal himself as as as the
[48:51] Prophet tells us and the message
[48:52] absolutely says God revealed himself to
[48:54] Abraham because he knew what Abraham was
[48:57] going to do even when God came to
[48:59] Abraham he says shall I hide that thing
[49:02] which I do seem that Abraham he shall
[49:04] command his household and his children
[49:07] after him so there has to be a word that
[49:11] goes out that is in regards to what this
[49:13] promise but it is solely up to God
[49:16] that God comes on the scene and confirms
[49:19] the promise that is given to every seed
[49:23] for every generation that's something
[49:27] that only God can do so it's like this
[49:29] we can preach the gospel but again it's
[49:31] up to God not one of us can baptize
[49:33] somebody with the Holy Ghost it's up to
[49:37] God to do that
[49:38] that's solemnly but we can baptize here
[49:41] in the tank but we cannot baptized into
[49:43] the body so this is solemnly in God's
[49:47] hands how wonderful that is how
[49:50] wonderful notice he says and I will
[49:52] give unto thee and to thy seed after
[49:55] thee the land where thou art a stranger
[49:57] and all the land of canaan for an
[49:59] everlasting possession and I will be
[50:02] their God and God said unto Abraham thou
[50:06] shalt keep my covenant therefore thou
[50:08] and thy seed after thee in their
[50:11] generations so here an unconditional
[50:15] covenant yet there are conditions that
[50:18] are set forth but the conditions that
[50:21] are that are set forth we know God is
[50:24] requiring that that there would be that
[50:27] covenant sign that God gives to that of
[50:30] Abraham that this covenant sign is to be
[50:33] in the flesh of his see in every
[50:36] generation yet yet we recognize that
[50:38] it's not just having just that sign of
[50:42] circumcision because there were many who
[50:45] had the sign of circumcision even in the
[50:47] days of the Lord Jesus but they failed
[50:49] to recognize their day of visitation you
[50:53] understand what I'm saying
[50:54] there many who had come to a certain
[50:56] Junction in the word but they failed to
[50:58] walk on with the word and the only way
[51:01] you can really come into a proper
[51:03] junction of the word is by revelation it
[51:07] takes divine revelation the Bible said
[51:09] that the righteousness of God is
[51:11] revealed from faith under faith so it
[51:14] must be God that reveals to every person
[51:17] - coming in through justification
[51:20] sanctification into the baptism of the
[51:22] Holy Ghost and then into the fullness of
[51:25] adoption so it must be God so here we
[51:28] find that it's God personally revealing
[51:31] himself as we look here in the word it's
[51:33] God personally revealing himself to the
[51:36] left to the elect to circumcise their
[51:39] heart by his spirit doing what removing
[51:43] that first nature that fleshly nature
[51:45] and setting within them a new nature a
[51:49] different nature and nature of his own
[51:52] life that which is a seed that is
[51:54] quickened and raised up into newness of
[51:57] life
[51:57] this is a sign this is a covenant sign
[52:00] so it's God revealing himself to that of
[52:04] the promised seed
[52:06] every one when God when God communicates
[52:11] this to Abraham remember now our Bible
[52:14] opens up and we begin to read about
[52:16] Abraham in Genesis 12 that's only the
[52:19] writing god always knew Abraham before
[52:25] it was ever in writing he was in God's
[52:28] thoughts you with me so now these
[52:32] thoughts are just beginning to be
[52:34] communicated and means are identified
[52:37] with these thoughts and there the whole
[52:40] time
[52:41] God knew and just like in every seed God
[52:44] knows every Apple every leaf that is
[52:47] there in that seed you don't act one
[52:50] more leaf or one more Apple to that seed
[52:52] everything that it is is in it then and
[52:56] God knew of every seed that he would
[53:01] make himself known to that was not you
[53:04] can see even here by God saying I'm the
[53:06] Lord I'm the Lord God of Abraham the
[53:09] Father God is not speaking of a natural
[53:12] continuity he's speaking of a spiritual
[53:15] revelation that it's not a natural seed
[53:18] it's a spiritual seed oh my so here is
[53:22] God coming coming down to reveal himself
[53:25] spirit us personally to Jacob and let me
[53:29] just go into this here a moment in
[53:30] Galatians chapter 3 the Bible begins to
[53:33] to speak to us even clearly and this as
[53:36] Paul is breaking this apart to Abraham
[53:39] and his seed where the promises made he
[53:42] saith not and to seeds as of many but as
[53:46] of one and to thy seed which is Christ
[53:50] so the promise when God is looking and
[53:53] he's declaring this to Abraham he's not
[53:56] talking about a natural seed yet the
[53:59] natural seed is given in type but God's
[54:02] talking about the spiritual seed because
[54:05] God himself he would become one of us
[54:09] and he's talking of that spiritual seed
[54:11] thy seed which is Christ for ye are all
[54:14] the children of God by faith in Christ
[54:16] Jesus
[54:17] for as many of us
[54:19] put has have been baptized into Christ
[54:22] have put on Christ for there is neither
[54:25] Jew nor Greek neither is their bond nor
[54:28] free there is neither male nor female
[54:30] for here all one in Christ Jesus
[54:33] and if you be Christ's then are ye
[54:36] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[54:40] the promise so God was not going to
[54:47] reveal himself to every natural seed he
[54:51] wasn't the natural see that God's
[54:52] committed to it's the spiritual seed
[54:55] that which is of himself he will reveal
[55:00] himself and establish his covenant
[55:03] personally just like what we were
[55:05] dealing with a little bit on Sunday
[55:07] every generation has to have their
[55:11] personal visitation every son and
[55:15] daughter of God has to have their
[55:17] personal experience with God every one
[55:21] so God is God is obligating himself
[55:27] oh my because this is not noticed it's
[55:30] just not a condition not a covenant
[55:32] that's based on the strength of Abraham
[55:34] that is not based on Abraham's
[55:36] continuity it is based on God who God
[55:39] had no end he had had no beginning he
[55:42] has no end
[55:45] look how Paul would pick this up again
[55:48] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13 for when God
[55:52] made promise to Abraham because he could
[55:55] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[55:58] saying blessing I will bless thee and
[56:01] multiplying I will multiply thee so when
[56:06] God spoke even in the even in the very
[56:09] beginning to Abraham when God spoke this
[56:12] is God swearing by himself this is an
[56:16] oath when God speaks when God's word
[56:19] comes forth it is God it is an oath of
[56:22] God God is committing himself when he
[56:25] speaks directly to Abraham it is God
[56:27] committing himself by his word
[56:30] don't you see when that battle the the
[56:33] RAM was caught in the thicket
[56:35] the RAM here it was it comes a creative
[56:37] Word of God
[56:38] it comes and is caught in the thicket
[56:40] that's the same way when God speaks his
[56:42] word it's God himself that is committing
[56:45] himself and he's committing himself to
[56:47] you and I his cheat his his children
[56:50] he's come how does he do it by his word
[56:53] hey man he's committing himself it's God
[56:57] coming down surely blessing I will bless
[57:01] thee and multiplying I will multiply
[57:03] thee in Hebrews 6:15 Paul goes on to say
[57:08] so after he had patiently endured he
[57:11] obtained the promise did Abraham have
[57:15] many ups and downs sure the Prophet says
[57:18] it like this and the message look 1963
[57:20] he said Abraham did not become consumed
[57:23] with the misunderstandings of the
[57:24] promise you see Abraham the Abraham
[57:29] we'll look at Abraham's life you could
[57:30] find a lot of fault and everything else
[57:32] in Abraham's life and Abraham even
[57:35] listened to Sarah in regards to Hagar is
[57:39] that right he listened this is
[57:41] misunderstandings of the promise right I
[57:44] could say that Abraham took a thought
[57:46] and he preached the white horse rider
[57:48] being the Holy Ghost
[57:50] you see misunderstandings of the promise
[57:53] but Abraham did not become consumed with
[57:56] the misunderstandings of the promise and
[57:58] neither are you to be consumed with
[58:01] misunderstandings even in your life is
[58:05] not to be consumed with
[58:06] misunderstandings we don't see things
[58:09] all the way the way we need to see him
[58:11] just reading here even even today or the
[58:14] Prophet was saying of how he said so
[58:16] many times he said God will allow his
[58:18] servants to know things that are here
[58:20] and there he said then other times he
[58:22] won't let us know anything he lets us
[58:24] walk right into troubles why why would
[58:27] God do that so he can make his glory
[58:29] known
[58:31] God knows how how to keep the pride down
[58:34] in our life hmm so after he had
[58:40] patiently endured he obtained the
[58:42] promise for men verily swear by the
[58:44] greater and an all for confirmation is
[58:47] to them an end of all strife so a person
[58:50] you know is there I promise you no I
[58:53] promise you no it's like when you go
[58:55] into court they want you to raise the
[58:56] right in there right but how many have
[59:00] lied under oath come on somebody how
[59:05] many of you have made promises and you
[59:07] hadn't kept him brother I promise no I'm
[59:11] not I'm not advocating that I had a
[59:15] brother tell me he said hey brother you
[59:17] said now you're coming to preach for me
[59:19] he said now you're not gonna you're not
[59:21] gonna back out on me he said because you
[59:22] know he said I believe we ought to keep
[59:23] our promises I said brother I do too I
[59:25] said but you know if there's some
[59:27] emergency comes up I'll break you
[59:28] understand I was just glad there what
[59:32] nun came up because I thought it might
[59:34] have you know really troubled that
[59:35] brother but I told my said brother I
[59:36] believe in keeping promises when I've
[59:38] told you I'm gonna be somewhere I said I
[59:41] believe with all my heart when God's
[59:42] laid it on my heart I'm gonna be there
[59:44] sure as the world but how many times
[59:47] have you and I made promises or I'll get
[59:49] to this I'll get to that I'll get to
[59:50] this I'll get to that and what happens
[59:53] to it I promise as the time comes and
[59:55] goes it doesn't get anywhere it's even
[59:57] look friends even in times when the
[59:59] presence of God has moved right down
[1:00:01] within a service and you and I have now
[1:00:03] we've been touched by God we have been
[1:00:05] stirred by God and then we find
[1:00:07] ourselves getting out right out from
[1:00:09] under you know coming out of the service
[1:00:11] and before we know it what we were
[1:00:13] stirred in our hearts to say Lord I'm
[1:00:14] more determined Lord I want and we find
[1:00:17] ourselves within the same condition then
[1:00:22] that shows the weakness of our promise
[1:00:28] so it's a lesson to us that it's not for
[1:00:32] us to make as far as just promises based
[1:00:35] on that but it would be rather to to
[1:00:38] acknowledge the weakness of us
[1:00:41] and the greatness of him and say Lord
[1:00:43] you who have made known your word you
[1:00:46] have revealed this you were a drawing of
[1:00:48] my life help me Lord God I think of how
[1:00:53] that Israel when the Israel himself when
[1:00:56] Jacob was changed and he began he comes
[1:00:58] to an altar and the altar is hello Loa
[1:01:01] Israel it is that all true it says help
[1:01:05] me the God who's able to help me live
[1:01:08] according to my new name amen the God
[1:01:12] who's able to help me live according to
[1:01:14] the name of Israel that's what we need
[1:01:18] that's what we must have amen because we
[1:01:22] can do a lot of things that we can then
[1:01:24] we get feeling bad about it but God this
[1:01:27] is where Paul is drawing this here where
[1:01:29] in God verse seventeenth willing more
[1:01:32] abundantly to show under the heirs of
[1:01:34] promise God wanted you and me to see
[1:01:37] this sure every generation had God is
[1:01:41] one of them
[1:01:42] to see this but God has wanted you and I
[1:01:45] to see this in this generation this
[1:01:48] generation I can't speak for another one
[1:01:50] but I can speak for us in this
[1:01:52] generation God wants us to know the in
[1:01:55] humility the immutability of his counsel
[1:01:57] that when he has promised he surely will
[1:02:01] perform hallelujah and he can't do it
[1:02:07] with just giving us just just some work
[1:02:09] but here he comes down by his living
[1:02:12] presence I'm telling you friends this is
[1:02:14] a visitation that God has brought to
[1:02:17] this generation and the Prophet said my
[1:02:20] ministry is to declare he is now here
[1:02:24] him and the presence of God is right
[1:02:28] here among us and that same presence has
[1:02:31] not removed it's not taken back but that
[1:02:34] same presence is here to guide and
[1:02:37] direct us all the way home he's not left
[1:02:41] into a man this is he made a promise to
[1:02:44] himself I will
[1:02:45] establish my covenant I will bring my
[1:02:48] children home in rapture he promised
[1:02:54] himself God more abundantly to show
[1:02:58] under the heirs of promise the
[1:03:00] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[1:03:03] by an oath this word immutability is not
[1:03:09] to be transposed you don't you don't
[1:03:13] transpose this it's not to be
[1:03:15] transferred fixed its unalterable it
[1:03:23] cannot be altered because it's not based
[1:03:28] on a man here is not something that was
[1:03:30] spoken by man it is God who swore by
[1:03:34] himself you catch what I just said there
[1:03:37] it's God who swore by himself when God
[1:03:40] begins to speak that's God swearing by
[1:03:43] himself they met when he come down here
[1:03:47] even in the end time what's he doing
[1:03:49] he's not making a new promise he is
[1:03:52] affirming to you and I the promise that
[1:03:54] he already has made and when the open is
[1:03:58] my seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:04:00] what is that it's an oath of
[1:04:02] confirmation it's God signified I have
[1:04:06] remembered my covenant were you with me
[1:04:09] when he came down there was a rain more
[1:04:11] about his head what is it his mind is on
[1:04:14] his covenant very many speaking
[1:04:18] according to his covenant he's speaking
[1:04:20] to his covenant children it's
[1:04:24] immutability you can't alter this
[1:04:29] because that by two immutable things in
[1:04:32] which it was impossible for God to lie
[1:04:34] we have a strong consolation who had
[1:04:39] fled for refuge to lay hold upon the
[1:04:42] hope set before us so he drew you he
[1:04:47] drew me what we were a part of him so he
[1:04:51] drew us to a place of refuge they
[1:04:54] managed it's him
[1:04:56] that is that place of refuge as it the
[1:04:58] office estates and here clearly
[1:05:01] fulfilled in the life of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:03] to every every into every child of God
[1:05:06] down through the ages he is that refuge
[1:05:09] for you and I one who is a culvert in a
[1:05:14] time of storm one who is a refuge I
[1:05:16] shall be a man shall be a refuge that
[1:05:19] man is Christ Jesus he is our refuge
[1:05:22] we have fled how could we flee because
[1:05:24] when we may have been looking and we
[1:05:26] have all these things about our life why
[1:05:28] is my life like this and why does it
[1:05:30] seem odd and why does this and why does
[1:05:31] that you know what that is that's a
[1:05:33] little seed on the inside before
[1:05:35] knowledge that's just moving around
[1:05:37] there but God knows where you were at
[1:05:39] and God sent forth his word he sent
[1:05:43] forth a voice to do what to call you out
[1:05:45] and lead you away from the Babylonian
[1:05:49] borders and God and conditions of this
[1:05:51] age he sent a word to lead you out to
[1:05:54] call you out come out of her my people
[1:05:56] being knocked our partaker of her deeds
[1:06:00] advice width us what voice was it his
[1:06:03] advice of all Madi God hallelujah Omaha
[1:06:11] and he called you to walk to a place of
[1:06:13] refuge
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:16] went for it you've still a hold upon the
[1:06:18] hope set before us which hope we have as
[1:06:22] an anchor of the soul both sure and
[1:06:26] steadfast and which interest into that
[1:06:29] within the veil whether the forerunner
[1:06:31] is for us entered even Jesus made a high
[1:06:34] priest forever after the order of
[1:06:35] Melchizedek an anchor is a precious
[1:06:38] thing you wonder why a ship is not
[1:06:42] moving or a boat's not moving it's
[1:06:44] because there's a connection you can't
[1:06:47] see the connection you only see the
[1:06:48] visible reality there's a connection
[1:06:52] storms and tests they come they Bob it
[1:06:54] around here Bob it around there but the
[1:06:56] anchor holds the anchor keeps it was
[1:07:03] body the flesh the spirit all those
[1:07:07] things Bob around but the soul is
[1:07:09] anchored
[1:07:10] the souls incurred there is an anchor
[1:07:14] beyond the veil a man and that veil is
[1:07:18] that veil we're in the Christ Jesus
[1:07:20] himself as as as entered for you and I
[1:07:23] it is in him so we see this conditions
[1:07:28] of an unconditional covenant what's the
[1:07:32] only condition that God has for an
[1:07:35] unconditional covenant because
[1:07:37] everything that we have read and we know
[1:07:40] of how God is spoke to Abraham I will I
[1:07:43] will I will I will I will but yet its
[1:07:48] conditions but not conditions like the
[1:07:50] conditional covenant the only conditions
[1:07:53] the only thing that God asked for you
[1:07:55] and I is to have faith in what what he
[1:08:02] already has said that's the only thing
[1:08:06] God asked for you and I have faith so
[1:08:09] what does faith do faith it brings about
[1:08:11] yielding and resting in him you with me
[1:08:18] so here watch how God speaks here let me
[1:08:22] just take the next little bit here in
[1:08:24] verse 25 or verse 15 of Genesis 18 God
[1:08:30] says to Jacob behold I am with thee how
[1:08:38] precious I am with me and will keep thee
[1:08:43] in all places whether thou goest and
[1:08:48] will bring me again into this land for I
[1:08:54] will not leave me until I have done that
[1:08:58] which I have spoken to the earth
[1:09:01] who no wonder David could have a little
[1:09:06] praise break every once a while and say
[1:09:07] happy is he whose God is the God of
[1:09:11] Jacob you with me there's reason because
[1:09:16] he could see that as far as deserving
[1:09:19] Jacob didn't deserve it
[1:09:22] Abraham didn't deserve it and neither do
[1:09:24] you and I were not here because we
[1:09:27] deserved it
[1:09:29] Amen they were not standing here tonight
[1:09:32] and in the set of soundness of Health or
[1:09:35] where we're at enjoying but the real a
[1:09:38] spiritual revelation of God ourselves
[1:09:41] being natural and being strengthened by
[1:09:44] Minds being transformed by the renewing
[1:09:47] of the Holy Ghost we don't deserve that
[1:09:52] what is it it's God has committed
[1:09:56] himself to his word he committed himself
[1:10:00] by speaking his word so here if we
[1:10:07] noticed in the scripture if we jump to
[1:10:10] verse 20 of Genesis 28 oh y'all ready
[1:10:16] you ready Jacob vowed a vow saying if
[1:10:22] God will be with me and will keep me in
[1:10:26] this way that I go and will give me
[1:10:29] bread to eat and raiment to put on so
[1:10:32] that I come again to my father's house
[1:10:34] in peace then shall the Lord be my god
[1:10:39] so what is Jacob doing here with a vow
[1:10:42] this is not like you and I you know we
[1:10:44] think of the term if as though that that
[1:10:48] that Jacob is making something in a
[1:10:50] terms of the conditional clause it's not
[1:10:54] that at all but but in reality of what
[1:10:57] Jacob is doing here is he is affirming
[1:11:00] what God has already said in earlier
[1:11:03] chapters you see it's one thing for
[1:11:06] Jacob to hear what his daddy told him he
[1:11:11] can say amen to that
[1:11:13] but now it's moved beyond that he's no
[1:11:15] longer just having to take what his
[1:11:18] daddy said but now he has met God face
[1:11:22] to face so he's no longer just happening
[1:11:25] to hear what Dad said
[1:11:26] but now the God who revealed himself
[1:11:29] daddy is revealing himself to him and
[1:11:33] it's no longer something to wear the
[1:11:35] promises are passed down second handed
[1:11:38] but the promises are passed and moved
[1:11:41] very in the first person I will be with
[1:11:44] thee amen hallelujah so here we're with
[1:11:49] Jacob when we look at it with the gulls
[1:11:51] you know in the translation they they
[1:11:53] lost indeed some of these things here
[1:11:55] because the language you know and I
[1:11:58] begin to study this the language is not
[1:11:59] of uncertainty but it's equivalent to
[1:12:02] sense or for as much so if I go back and
[1:12:05] I read that verse of scripture go back
[1:12:07] up to verse 20 and Jacob vowed a vow
[1:12:10] saying since God will be with me not if
[1:12:17] this isn't well I don't know if he's
[1:12:19] real or not I don't know this is not
[1:12:20] what this is since God or for as much as
[1:12:24] God will be with me and will keep me in
[1:12:27] this way that I go and will give me
[1:12:29] bread to eat and raiment to put on it
[1:12:32] changes it doesn't it it changes it from
[1:12:34] something of a hope so
[1:12:36] to way what's he based on faith remember
[1:12:38] how do we apply the Word of God by faith
[1:12:41] every promise of God even to that of
[1:12:44] justification sanctification are you
[1:12:47] with me to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:49] to the rapture
[1:12:50] it's appropriated by faith it's what he
[1:12:53] has already provided and we appropriated
[1:12:56] in our own lives by faith we recognize
[1:12:59] the promises for us and we affirm that I
[1:13:02] am the one as many as the Lord our God
[1:13:05] shall call we affirm that and what is
[1:13:07] that we receive blessed assurance
[1:13:11] personally because you see within this
[1:13:17] of the scripture when we look at this
[1:13:20] part here he says as far as God if God
[1:13:25] is Elohim will be with me there's a lot
[1:13:29] called Elohim a lot of the gods within
[1:13:32] the the land Elohim God right first
[1:13:36] kings 18 what did what did Elijah stand
[1:13:38] there and say first Kings 18 he said
[1:13:41] well
[1:13:42] you come to Mount Carmel and who ever
[1:13:45] whichever God answers by fire
[1:13:48] then what let him be the Lord see
[1:13:54] stepping forward and becoming personal
[1:13:58] here with me now from glad to become
[1:14:02] Jehovah let him be personally revealed
[1:14:05] to you he that answers by fire let him
[1:14:09] become personal to you glory be to God
[1:14:13] so here the promises since not if for as
[1:14:18] much notice I like how it states it
[1:14:21] Jacob my faith was appropriating and
[1:14:24] anticipating the fulfillment of the
[1:14:27] promise there was no question there was
[1:14:31] no question it was by faith he was not
[1:14:35] if God but since God will be with me
[1:14:38] since God was with him
[1:14:40] he could expect all of these things
[1:14:42] notice God there in that verse of
[1:14:44] scripture he God doesn't say anything as
[1:14:47] far as in the scripture when he made
[1:14:49] himself known in Jeff in verse 17 of
[1:14:51] Genesis 18 God didn't say anything about
[1:14:53] raiment and bread and whatever more
[1:14:55] that's a given
[1:14:57] are you with me that's a definite God
[1:15:01] already listen if God has called you God
[1:15:05] has ordained you listen God Himself will
[1:15:08] provide for himself all of your things
[1:15:11] that you need that's why the Lord Jesus
[1:15:13] could say he said don't get your mind
[1:15:16] set on the necessities of this life seek
[1:15:19] ye first the kingdom of God and all
[1:15:22] these other things will be added unto
[1:15:25] you
[1:15:26] do we have to pray sometimes God
[1:15:28] provided job God provide Rieman Lord I
[1:15:31] need food do we have to pray sure we do
[1:15:34] what we're showing here is that God
[1:15:36] already has it all taken care of
[1:15:40] Jacob's just spelling it out right he
[1:15:44] has needs oh my then that wonderful God
[1:15:49] God already knows what's your and he
[1:15:51] knew what your need was be tonight
[1:15:53] he knew where you've been sitting here
[1:15:55] tonight and even how you would say it
[1:15:57] specifically but he already covered it
[1:15:59] it doesn't matter we can have a
[1:16:01] multitude of diseases that are sitting
[1:16:03] in this room tonight even two are just
[1:16:05] three but yet God has it all covered but
[1:16:08] by His stripes we are healed I have the
[1:16:11] Lord that he'll a log on diseases you
[1:16:14] might say God I need you to move for
[1:16:16] cancer I need you to move for diabetes I
[1:16:18] need you to move my blood pressure what
[1:16:20] I need you to provide a job I need you
[1:16:23] to provide a house I need you to brah he
[1:16:25] already is over all of that come on no
[1:16:34] wonder David could say I've never seen
[1:16:36] the righteous forsaken never seen a
[1:16:39] child of God Megan Brennan
[1:16:41] let's see this was only included this
[1:16:45] was included it's like everybody put it
[1:16:48] this simple to you
[1:16:49] it's like going and asking for a deluxe
[1:16:51] cheeseburger and then you tell them to
[1:16:52] put in lettuce and tomato and cheese on
[1:16:53] it duh that's already included with the
[1:16:56] deluxe you don't have to tell him I need
[1:16:59] pickles on it
[1:17:00] I want mayonnaise on it I want mustard
[1:17:02] on it I want ketchup on it I want a big
[1:17:04] ol slice onion on it it's already
[1:17:06] included with a deluxe you don't have to
[1:17:10] tell him I want a bacon cheeseburger you
[1:17:11] know what I like bacon on it gets
[1:17:13] included you don't order a piece of of
[1:17:19] apple pie a la mode or whatever it is
[1:17:21] and say by the way I want that apple pie
[1:17:23] all along and I want ice cream on there
[1:17:25] it shows either you don't understand
[1:17:28] what you're asking for or you're
[1:17:30] doubting their ability to fulfill
[1:17:31] everything that is laid out there oh my
[1:17:34] I'm telling you God has already included
[1:17:38] everything that you and I have need up
[1:17:40] sometimes we don't see it we don't hear
[1:17:43] it right away but we have this assurance
[1:17:45] I'm living here I'm in this place I'm in
[1:17:48] this generation and as long as I'm here
[1:17:51] I am one of his he is committed to his
[1:17:54] word never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:18:00] Amen guaranteed by God and verse 15 and
[1:18:04] accepted by the patriarch
[1:18:08] as one writer would say like this I've
[1:18:11] taken up a saying if Elohim will be
[1:18:14] Jehovah to me then jihad then then then
[1:18:17] Jehovah will be Elohim to me God will be
[1:18:21] Jehovah to me and Jehovah will be Elohim
[1:18:25] to me God will reveal himself to be one
[1:18:29] who was not agree who is existing with
[1:18:31] me Jehovah and Jehovah will be what Edel
[1:18:36] him to me God see that revelation
[1:18:41] so this is where Jacob is resting he is
[1:18:46] affirming what God has said watch how
[1:18:48] God let's just take a little journey
[1:18:49] here for a few moments Genesis 26 verse
[1:18:53] 23 and here is isaac and isaac went up
[1:18:57] from thence to bear sheba he's been
[1:18:58] digging wells that his father dug and
[1:19:00] he's been naming them the same names and
[1:19:02] the Lord appeared unto him the same
[1:19:04] night and said I am the God of Abraham
[1:19:06] thy father he's not just a natural
[1:19:10] it's a spiritual time fear not for I am
[1:19:15] with thee and will bless thee and
[1:19:17] multiply thy seed for my servant
[1:19:20] Abraham's sake he was under the blessing
[1:19:25] because what it wasn't because he was
[1:19:27] Abraham's bow he was under the blessing
[1:19:30] because he was the spiritual son of
[1:19:33] Abraham
[1:19:34] we're not blessed because were natural
[1:19:37] progeny of the prophet in this hour we
[1:19:40] are blessed because we are spiritual
[1:19:42] sons and daughters that are born of the
[1:19:44] world that is coming this hour
[1:19:46] hey man we have been ordained within the
[1:19:51] wounds of the word and we have stepped
[1:19:53] fast in this hour it's been a word that
[1:19:56] has called you around and that word has
[1:19:58] found its mark within our lives I fear
[1:20:05] not I'll say that's God's word to every
[1:20:10] generation
[1:20:11] it's his word to you and I tonight when
[1:20:13] God has revealed himself to you and I
[1:20:16] his word is
[1:20:18] I'm with me Joshua 1 verse 8 hallelujah
[1:20:26] let me go to verse 9 just the same time
[1:20:29] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[1:20:34] of a good courage be not afraid neither
[1:20:37] be thou dismayed when God writes things
[1:20:41] here in his word be not afraid neither
[1:20:43] be thou dismayed there's gonna be times
[1:20:45] he is afraid there's gonna be times he
[1:20:48] is dismayed but this is where the word
[1:20:51] see what the word is doing the weired is
[1:20:53] giving direction to the word but not so
[1:20:56] many I'm gonna say hold ya no need to be
[1:20:58] afraid I don't need to be dismayed the
[1:21:00] spirit man ain't gonna say that but
[1:21:01] who's gonna receive this the inner man
[1:21:03] the inner man then takes that word and
[1:21:06] stands on it be not afraid
[1:21:07] be not dismayed what does it do it has
[1:21:10] an effect upon the rest of the realms be
[1:21:16] not afraid neither be thou dismayed so
[1:21:19] where is he gonna draw the strength from
[1:21:20] from looking into the word that's
[1:21:23] already gone because the word that's
[1:21:25] already come is God fulfilling a
[1:21:27] covenant that he made and made it be
[1:21:30] known to Abraham it's caught unfolding
[1:21:33] this covenant and he's letting it be
[1:21:35] known meditate on it give yourself to it
[1:21:37] keep yourself in it because what out of
[1:21:39] here you're gonna draw strength but out
[1:21:41] of here about spiritual revelation my
[1:21:44] image is going to be revealed and made
[1:21:47] known to you you realize friends that
[1:21:52] just with knowing quotes is not knowing
[1:21:55] the image of God people can know the
[1:21:58] scriptures and not know the image of God
[1:22:00] whatsoever the image of God is not flesh
[1:22:02] the image of God it's not written the
[1:22:04] image of God is not letter but the image
[1:22:07] of God will always project the very
[1:22:10] harmony and true understanding of what
[1:22:13] the letter is saying and the only way
[1:22:16] the image can come is by a spiritual
[1:22:18] revelation this is how the Lord Jesus
[1:22:20] walked
[1:22:20] he was the example of how you and I as
[1:22:22] sons and daughters are walked he didn't
[1:22:24] say
[1:22:24] whatsoever the son here no whatsoever
[1:22:26] the son Rita nope whatsoever the son see
[1:22:29] that doeth the father what he seeth the
[1:22:32] father doing that doeth the son likewise
[1:22:34] and that same harmony is to exist with
[1:22:36] our lives and I believe it is cieth what
[1:22:39] it's to where that the where the
[1:22:41] understanding is opening up because why
[1:22:43] he was the first one of this new race
[1:22:46] he's the first one quickened at the
[1:22:48] river and that's why the Lord Jesus said
[1:22:50] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:22:52] the kingdom of God so here he was he
[1:22:56] receives the revelation of God and who
[1:22:58] God is for God and goes forth in that
[1:23:01] day what does he do reflect God that's
[1:23:04] what he could say how long have I been
[1:23:05] with you in you you don't know me how
[1:23:09] can we reflect God unless we receive the
[1:23:11] revelation of God and how can we receive
[1:23:13] the revelation of God unless we are of
[1:23:15] God sounds like a family thing dinner to
[1:23:18] me boom ah be not afraid neither be thou
[1:23:24] dismayed for the Lord by God is with
[1:23:27] thee whether so ever thou goest in the
[1:23:30] fitting brother bill this is not
[1:23:32] mentioned in the middle of the book of
[1:23:33] Joshua in this fitting it's right in the
[1:23:37] very beginning it's God letting Joshua
[1:23:39] know from the onset before you ever step
[1:23:41] foot in the land this is what I'm saying
[1:23:43] to you
[1:23:44] don't fear I am with thee the Lord
[1:23:49] Jehovah one who is existing with you I'm
[1:23:54] existing with you my family what is this
[1:23:59] the comfort its comfort oh my here's a
[1:24:04] real brave guy by the name of Gideon
[1:24:07] verse 12 of Genesis 6 here he is he's
[1:24:11] done heard the prophets message but he
[1:24:13] goes back out and keeps on throwing you
[1:24:14] know hiding hiding away throwing you
[1:24:16] know threshing wheat and he's hiding and
[1:24:18] the angel of the Lord appeared to him
[1:24:20] and said unto Him the Lord is with thee
[1:24:23] thou mighty man of Valor now notice this
[1:24:26] has he moved from the Prophet now into a
[1:24:29] place to where the angel of the Lord who
[1:24:32] directed the Prophet anointed the
[1:24:33] Prophet who gave the message now the
[1:24:35] angel of the Lord comes to visit those
[1:24:37] who the message was intended for and
[1:24:40] when when Gideon looks at the
[1:24:43] he does not say this is an angel of the
[1:24:45] Lord oh this is a great man Gideon talks
[1:24:50] to him as he would talk to God talk to
[1:24:51] the guy down with the store selling seed
[1:24:53] you understand he doesn't hear wasn't
[1:24:56] like anything not like great like oh my
[1:24:58] he's talking to him like he talked to
[1:25:01] anybody else
[1:25:03] you know God makes himself known in such
[1:25:06] simplicity you know why God doesn't want
[1:25:08] to act you don't want acting he wants us
[1:25:12] to be simple he wants you and I to talk
[1:25:15] to him because what if this had meant to
[1:25:18] Gideon if he would have known right away
[1:25:19] but you see what God does God comes
[1:25:22] through by way of the word that invokes
[1:25:25] a question out of Gideon what was it it
[1:25:27] was a longing that was within Gideon and
[1:25:29] how did Gideon have that longing he was
[1:25:31] a part of God and God was longing to
[1:25:33] express himself the longing that you
[1:25:35] have within yourself belonging the
[1:25:37] desire that longing for rapture what is
[1:25:40] it because God's longing direction when
[1:25:44] God's longing to heal you
[1:25:46] it drops notice the Lord is with thee
[1:25:49] thou mighty man of Valor we know how the
[1:25:54] Lord had to work on Gideon's life quite
[1:25:56] a bit God had to deal with Gideon and
[1:25:59] continued to move with Gideon throughout
[1:26:02] this is where look at this the Lord is
[1:26:04] with thee thou mighty man of Valor you
[1:26:08] know I think you know some years ago but
[1:26:11] I'm looking at this and preached and I
[1:26:12] said no doubt Gideon looked around said
[1:26:14] who's the other fella in the room he
[1:26:17] sure ain't talking about me he's looking
[1:26:19] at the biggest chicken there ever was
[1:26:21] but he's seen an eagle down beneath him
[1:26:23] chicken feathers it's an eagle down
[1:26:26] there on the inside the Lord is with
[1:26:28] thee now notice this God being with him
[1:26:31] would not leave him in his fear he
[1:26:35] wouldn't leave him in a place of
[1:26:37] unsettledness but he said go get your
[1:26:40] offering go get your yeah what's your
[1:26:43] gonna offer I'll go and get it put it
[1:26:44] here on the rock what does he do he's
[1:26:46] working with him all the way God says go
[1:26:49] down and I want you to tear down altars
[1:26:51] that are there in your daddy's place and
[1:26:53] I understand you're fearful God night
[1:26:54] and
[1:26:55] the most important thing is he's doing
[1:26:58] it
[1:26:59] whoa don't let the devil try to trick
[1:27:04] you into clowning for him Rain Man you
[1:27:07] obey God's Word you don't have to mind
[1:27:10] the devil at all the devil could have
[1:27:13] got on his children said if you were a
[1:27:14] real son of God
[1:27:15] a real faith you'd do it in daylight but
[1:27:18] God knew what he wanted to do it at
[1:27:19] nighttime because they didn't know who
[1:27:22] threw it down but then there came the
[1:27:24] response if bail is God he should be
[1:27:27] able to protect his own altar hallelujah
[1:27:32] we find that that goes on what was it
[1:27:35] the Lord is with thee
[1:27:36] the Lord being with they didn't mean
[1:27:38] that it's always a shouting time in the
[1:27:39] Jubilee time the Lord being with you is
[1:27:42] God committed to his word to bring you
[1:27:45] from start to finish even through his
[1:27:49] long suffering his patience him dealing
[1:27:52] with us it's God working with us all the
[1:27:54] time
[1:27:55] whether there's fleeces on the ground
[1:27:58] and that's this side it's wet her next
[1:28:00] time on the ground is wet and that's Rob
[1:28:02] it's God himself that is committed to
[1:28:05] his word understand you can't compare a
[1:28:09] desert to a get in and then they can you
[1:28:11] compare getting in the David they are
[1:28:12] each coming to maturity you understand
[1:28:17] if you compare a Gideon to a David
[1:28:19] you'll say getting her that guy's a
[1:28:20] little wishy-washy no sir that's not the
[1:28:22] way it is in God's eye at all it's God
[1:28:24] bringing maturity within their life it's
[1:28:26] God's showing the greatness of His grace
[1:28:28] that will overcome all the complexes
[1:28:30] Gideon had a lot of complexes in his
[1:28:32] life but the grace of God is always
[1:28:34] overriding that God appeared to Mary and
[1:28:39] let her know her the Lord is with thee
[1:28:41] blessed art thou among women it wasn't
[1:28:46] just something that she that the Lord
[1:28:48] just happened to be with her then he was
[1:28:51] with her the whole time hey man he was
[1:28:56] watching over her life the whole time no
[1:28:59] doubt the enemy you know look let's look
[1:29:01] friends when when when Satan sees that
[1:29:05] there's a little bit of a you know
[1:29:07] something to wear that he's kind of
[1:29:08] drawn
[1:29:09] maybe there were things that about
[1:29:10] Mary's life that he's kind of looking at
[1:29:12] and he knows a virgin's going to
[1:29:14] conceive so no doubt no doubt how the
[1:29:16] enemy had everything so tangled to try
[1:29:18] to Mar life after life after life after
[1:29:21] life but yet this was where God was
[1:29:25] protecting and watching over Mary there
[1:29:29] were certain things that she turned down
[1:29:30] maybe she wouldn't have thought there
[1:29:32] was anything Supernatural about her
[1:29:34] decision at that moment but it was God
[1:29:36] directing her away from that pathway
[1:29:37] what was it it was God watching over as
[1:29:42] God told Jacob not I will be I am worth
[1:29:48] a now and I will stay with thee God had
[1:29:54] his hand look at this of how that God
[1:29:57] speaks in Isaiah 41 fear'd I'm not
[1:30:00] you're speaking of Israel fear thou not
[1:30:03] I am with thee be not dismayed for I am
[1:30:05] thy God I will strengthen thee yea I
[1:30:08] will help thee yea I will uphold thee
[1:30:11] with the right hand of my righteousness
[1:30:14] behold all they that are incensed
[1:30:17] against thee shall be ashamed and
[1:30:18] confounded they shall be as nothing and
[1:30:21] they stat strive with these Shall Perish
[1:30:22] thou shalt seek them and thou shall not
[1:30:26] find them even then that contended with
[1:30:28] thee they that war against thee shall be
[1:30:31] as nothing and as a thing of not I'm
[1:30:34] telling you this this is a promise for
[1:30:37] you and I even the things that you're
[1:30:40] contending and fighting right now
[1:30:42] remember I am received I will give thee
[1:30:45] strength I will help thee I will I will
[1:30:48] overcome through you I will manifest my
[1:30:51] overcoming power I will strengthen you
[1:30:54] and that thing that you with and
[1:30:58] contended with I will make known my
[1:31:00] glory and you shall see there is no more
[1:31:03] contention for I the LORD have help thee
[1:31:05] [Applause]
[1:31:08] for the for how the LORD thy God will
[1:31:11] hold thy right hand what's that right
[1:31:13] hand by strength I will hold that
[1:31:16] strength saying unto thee fear not I
[1:31:20] will help thee
[1:31:21] did you catch that saying unto thee
[1:31:24] what's it mean he's gonna keep saying
[1:31:27] when he needs to say I will help thee I
[1:31:31] was up thee fear not I will help thee I
[1:31:35] don't know about you but I'm glad that
[1:31:39] he still speaks I'm glad that he still
[1:31:43] comes by and says fear not I will help
[1:31:45] thee fear not I'm helping me
[1:31:48] fear not hang up Andy what's he doing
[1:31:51] this is way promised I will come and I
[1:31:55] will say this unto you
[1:31:57] Hebrews 13:5 let not your conversation
[1:32:01] be with covetousness and be content with
[1:32:06] such things as you have this is a battle
[1:32:11] now don't just think of it as oh yes I'd
[1:32:15] like to have little other seats and I'd
[1:32:17] like them to be cooled I'd like them to
[1:32:18] be heated and look friends sometimes
[1:32:21] we're in the midst of this let your
[1:32:23] conversation be without covetousness and
[1:32:26] we can look up on other lives and think
[1:32:27] I wish I had it easy like them
[1:32:29] and what you're saying you're seeing a
[1:32:31] son and daughter of God and you have no
[1:32:33] idea what kind of battles they go
[1:32:35] through let me retract that you do have
[1:32:40] an idea because you go through the same
[1:32:42] battles it's just what you're saying is
[1:32:45] is that one that has been able by God's
[1:32:47] grace to may come under that maturity
[1:32:50] and be able to look and direct their
[1:32:53] focus and attitude away from present
[1:32:56] circumstances that look very bleak and
[1:32:59] very dismal but they're able to look
[1:33:02] what is that that's letting be let all
[1:33:04] that everything before the side without
[1:33:06] covering us being content contend with
[1:33:08] what content with who I am in the Lord
[1:33:11] and who God has made himself known to me
[1:33:16] so he said this is where I rest for he
[1:33:19] has said I will never leave thee nor
[1:33:22] forsake so that we may boldly say
[1:33:32] boldly wonder what boldly means boldly
[1:33:40] don't necessarily mean we're youwere
[1:33:41] yelling it out boldly speaks of
[1:33:45] confidence
[1:33:48] it's a humility in his presence not well
[1:33:52] I think that the Lord had I you know I
[1:33:55] really believe God oh I think you helped
[1:33:58] me
[1:33:58] that's not affirming that's not
[1:34:01] affirming if I can put it to you like
[1:34:04] this he's the high priest of your
[1:34:06] confession that I think he can I think
[1:34:09] he will he's still setting and not
[1:34:11] acting the rare the way the way to bring
[1:34:14] him in action is to affirm his word by
[1:34:16] face I am the lord that healeth all thy
[1:34:20] diseases the Lord is my helper and I
[1:34:25] will not fear what man shall do unto me
[1:34:29] was directing our attention to him oh my
[1:34:33] let me just have just a few more moments
[1:34:35] can I Isaiah 43 verse 1
[1:34:38] I'll speak fast you listen fast but now
[1:34:43] thus saith the Lord that created the old
[1:34:45] Jacob and he that formed the O Israel
[1:34:46] fear not for I have redeemed thee I have
[1:34:48] called me by name thou art mine when
[1:34:51] thou passer through the waters I will be
[1:34:53] with thee through the rivers they shall
[1:34:55] not overflow thee when that walk is
[1:34:58] through the fire that shall not be
[1:34:59] burdened neither shall the flame Kindle
[1:35:02] upon thee I think there's three boys
[1:35:08] Hebrew boys they told the king we don't
[1:35:15] know whether God will deliver us from
[1:35:20] the fire but he will deliver us from you
[1:35:25] what were they looking the Lord is my
[1:35:28] help
[1:35:30] there had to be a promise that they
[1:35:33] could stand on to even know that God has
[1:35:36] said I will deliver you from the flame
[1:35:38] they even happened that you said by the
[1:35:40] same they said they didn't know that's
[1:35:42] exactly right it wasn't revealed to them
[1:35:43] but there is a promise in God's Word
[1:35:45] what is God letting him be known right
[1:35:47] here that there is nothing that can take
[1:35:49] you out without I first have given
[1:35:54] permission Oh glory be to God I'm
[1:36:00] talking about an immutable counselor
[1:36:04] what assignment what should that do it
[1:36:06] should relieve all fear it should be
[1:36:10] able you're to take a word and be able
[1:36:11] to cast out fear
[1:36:12] so I am THE LORD thy God the Holy One of
[1:36:15] Israel thy Savior
[1:36:17] I gave Egypt for thy ransom Ethiopia and
[1:36:20] save it for thee since that was precious
[1:36:23] in my sight
[1:36:24] thou has been honorable I have loved
[1:36:26] thee therefore will I give men for thee
[1:36:29] and people for thy life fear not I am
[1:36:32] with thee I will bring thy seed from the
[1:36:35] east and gather thee from the west I
[1:36:37] will say to the north give up and to the
[1:36:40] south keep not back bring my son's from
[1:36:42] far and like daughters from the ends of
[1:36:44] the earth even everyone that is called
[1:36:47] by my name for I have created him for my
[1:36:49] glory I have formed him yay I have made
[1:36:52] him God is committed to calling every
[1:36:59] one of his children though they may have
[1:37:04] went to the north though they may went
[1:37:06] to the south no matter whether at his
[1:37:08] word will find them wherever they're at
[1:37:11] I'm telling you this is not only God
[1:37:14] promising himself to Israel where he had
[1:37:17] dropped back his children calling him
[1:37:19] back home but God has called his
[1:37:22] children in this hour back home God has
[1:37:25] said to the North give up my sons
[1:37:27] God has said to the south give up my
[1:37:29] daughter's God I said to thee give up my
[1:37:31] son give up my daughters what is his
[1:37:34] word that's brought an authority and a
[1:37:36] command let him go
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:41] amen I will bring him back to me I will
[1:37:47] not leave thee until I have performed
[1:37:50] what I have spoken unto the earth I'm
[1:37:54] gonna bring you all the way back home
[1:37:57] Jacob I'm not talking about just to an
[1:38:01] earthly home you are in my mind before
[1:38:04] the foundation of the world and God
[1:38:07] begins to reveal himself to you and I
[1:38:10] what is it raises up to us Ferb we
[1:38:13] recognize I am NOT the son of James and
[1:38:17] Pat browning I'm a son of God what
[1:38:20] happens we begin to affirm what God is
[1:38:23] declaring and what did he say I'll bring
[1:38:25] you back home I'll bring you back to
[1:38:29] myself I'll bring you in a body change
[1:38:32] I will bring maturity in your life while
[1:38:37] watching over you and every pathway and
[1:38:39] every little and every little crook and
[1:38:42] every little place along the way but I
[1:38:45] will bring you back to myself I'm
[1:38:47] watching over and guiding and directing
[1:38:49] your footstep I will bring you that and
[1:38:53] I will not depart from thee until I have
[1:38:55] performed it see God I'm not gonna read
[1:38:59] these but let me refer to him God
[1:39:02] affirms his promise I read that one
[1:39:04] earlier in Isaiah God said saying fear
[1:39:07] not I am with thee God let it be known
[1:39:10] in the book of Deuteronomy when you go
[1:39:11] into battle I want you to remember I the
[1:39:15] Lord him with me he said let them draw
[1:39:18] near
[1:39:19] let them draw near as they approach into
[1:39:21] the battle battle and when you come into
[1:39:23] the battle let it be declared I am the
[1:39:26] Lord your God that goes with you to
[1:39:28] fight you fight for you against your
[1:39:30] enemies to save you God wanted that said
[1:39:34] you with me tonight
[1:39:36] God wanted that said that's where that
[1:39:40] when God would speak right down through
[1:39:43] his word sometimes it might come out
[1:39:45] word for word for word but God is
[1:39:47] affirming his promise Oh
[1:39:49] over and over to you and I God brings it
[1:39:53] this angle God brings that that angle
[1:39:54] God brings it this angle and God knows
[1:39:56] exactly when you're in a battle when
[1:39:58] you're headed to a battle and God knows
[1:40:00] how to show up and God knows how to
[1:40:02] affirm his word to you and I how the
[1:40:04] LORD thy God am with thee when they got
[1:40:08] discouraged in the time of building the
[1:40:11] temple and building up that temple they
[1:40:14] got discouraged and they started talking
[1:40:15] like the enemy but time has not come
[1:40:18] this is not the time to build the
[1:40:20] tabernacle of God where did they get
[1:40:22] that from they didn't get that from God
[1:40:25] they didn't get that from them from from
[1:40:27] the messengers what happened they become
[1:40:30] discouraged by false accusations I could
[1:40:34] preach a whole lot on that they become
[1:40:36] discouraged
[1:40:37] well you reckon that Satan is the
[1:40:39] accuser of the brother he wants the
[1:40:43] accuser and he's there to accuse day and
[1:40:44] night but has the prophet speaks to you
[1:40:47] and I and lets us know that our Father
[1:40:49] is there to declare yes Adam did this
[1:40:51] yes they were born into this back there
[1:40:54] is a blood that has spoke for them
[1:40:56] already
[1:40:59] hallelujah accusation over with what you
[1:41:03] don't know I shut up I don't want to
[1:41:04] hear it because there is nothing there
[1:41:10] Lord God may we take lessons like that
[1:41:13] shut up I don't want to hear it you're
[1:41:17] gonna talk about this one talk about
[1:41:18] shut up I don't want to hear it because
[1:41:22] either you're gonna prophesy like Moses
[1:41:24] oh you're gonna prophesy like Balaam
[1:41:25] either you're gonna point out the good
[1:41:27] or you're gonna point out the bad come
[1:41:30] on somebody and whatever you do
[1:41:31] determines what spirits you're under you
[1:41:35] understand we're not talking about
[1:41:37] pointing out sin Balaam was trying to
[1:41:39] find fault he was trying to find fault
[1:41:42] and point out all the weak places and
[1:41:44] all the hind remotes but notice even
[1:41:46] with his great determination God said
[1:41:49] I'll turn your mouth around boy and God
[1:41:51] what did he come right down to God never
[1:41:53] revealed himself to Balaam as Ward God
[1:41:55] never it was never a personal revelation
[1:41:57] God made known to Balaam
[1:42:00] not Lord God God he could prophesy he
[1:42:04] could speak but he never had a
[1:42:05] relationship with God and even in the
[1:42:08] midst of that God over all right in the
[1:42:10] midst of it and he begins to speak of
[1:42:12] the hollow trees he begins to speak of
[1:42:15] the great promises all glory be to God
[1:42:19] it matters what Spirit doesn't it
[1:42:22] glory be to God hear how a guy stands in
[1:42:27] this time let's stand hey guy stands in
[1:42:30] the midst of this time when accusation
[1:42:32] has come and God directs Hege odd to say
[1:42:37] you guys are saying that the time that's
[1:42:39] not coming who said that but see it
[1:42:44] wasn't something they were so much
[1:42:45] saying here they were saying it here
[1:42:48] here so they were saying it this is not
[1:42:51] the time you could tell by the way they
[1:42:54] were conducting their lives God God
[1:42:56] looked at him through hegau and said
[1:42:58] look at you you got better jobs than you
[1:43:00] ever had more money in you ever had but
[1:43:03] you see I won't let you be content with
[1:43:05] that you put it down on the table I blew
[1:43:07] on it
[1:43:07] so that you're making more but yet you
[1:43:09] have less why why would God do that
[1:43:13] because God is interested in his purpose
[1:43:16] being fulfilled and so Hagee eyes speaks
[1:43:21] to those brothering
[1:43:23] in verse 13 of hege i wanna i love this
[1:43:27] i love this scripture then spake Haggai
[1:43:29] the lord's messenger in the lord's
[1:43:32] message unto the people saying i and
[1:43:35] with you say you know solomon mentions
[1:43:43] because let me just look at this for a
[1:43:46] moment when God says I am with thee
[1:43:49] Solomon said let let God be with us as
[1:43:52] he was with our fathers why it's not
[1:43:55] just it wasn't just a just that Lord
[1:43:57] wait we just want your presence but
[1:43:58] Solomon knew that by the presence of God
[1:44:02] that it would be God guiding and God
[1:44:05] directing the people as a matter of fact
[1:44:07] Solomon said like this that he might
[1:44:09] incline our
[1:44:11] arts to walk in his way so what will the
[1:44:16] Lord God being with them what would he
[1:44:18] do incline the hearts calls the heart to
[1:44:21] be tender cause the heart to seek after
[1:44:24] his way the presence of God is here to
[1:44:28] transform us and don't be mistaken when
[1:44:31] I say transformation I'm not just
[1:44:33] talking about a new birth but the
[1:44:35] Prophet takes it even a step deeper and
[1:44:37] he says now that we've been saved now
[1:44:40] that we've been filled with the Holy
[1:44:41] Ghost may we receive the transformation
[1:44:43] by the renewing of the mind of Christ
[1:44:46] what is that speaking maturity come from
[1:44:51] birth into full maturity full adoption
[1:44:54] what's he renewing he's renewing our
[1:44:57] mind by the Holy Ghost changing us so
[1:45:03] here is here's the comfort we have I
[1:45:06] thought of that scripture today if God
[1:45:09] be for us who can be against us let me
[1:45:13] say since God is for us who can be
[1:45:18] against us not if since for as much as
[1:45:23] God is for us who can be against us
[1:45:26] being confident of this one thing that
[1:45:30] he that have begun the good work in you
[1:45:32] shall perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:45:36] Christ I will not leave me I'll be with
[1:45:39] me and I will bring me back I will be
[1:45:44] with me
[1:45:54] what a blessed assurance that is laid
[1:45:58] for us here within our lives in our
[1:46:02] hearts I say Lord granite granite lon
[1:46:09] let me let the greatness of that immune
[1:46:13] ability let it so move and resolve
[1:46:17] dissolving every doubt dissolving
[1:46:19] anything that's unlike you Lord let it
[1:46:22] dissolve everything Lord casting out all
[1:46:25] fear
[1:46:27] removing Lord remnants of Samuel or
[1:46:31] removing remnants Lord God anything that
[1:46:34] is hindering because your counsel Lord
[1:46:37] cannot be defeated so Lord I surrender I
