========================================
for e e for e e e e e e e e e e e for e e e e e [Music] e e for e [Music] e e e e [Music] e e for e e [Music] e e e for e e e e e e e e e for e [Music] e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e [Music] for e e for e e e e e e e e e e e e yet she still had a testimony she said oh that my Lord would go to Israel because there's a prophet in Israel that could heal my lord of his disease she had a testimony she had the right attitude she had the right Spirit though she was taken from her family though she was taken for her loved ones she still had a conviction she still had a a a a a a way about her that that that she remembered the prophet in the land of Israel it reminds me of of of of that that black slave that brother brandham talks about and back then they would go brother brandham says that they would buy him like used cars brother Brenham said this he said man uh God made man in his own image but man made man a slave and so brother Brenham talks this says about this story and he says here's this man and and they were going and they were going to buy themselves a slave and everybody else they had to beat him get to work hurry up and get things done they would whip him they would have to have to beat him real good to get them to do something uh you know a lot of times it doesn't work the best especially when you're at work you know you think you have to have some kind of uh bad attitude with somebody to get them to work harder no whenever you're a leader you want to bring the best out in that person you don't have to put somebody down to get something out of them but we want to lift them up that's how you get the best out of somebody you tell them what they're good at you tell them who they are not what they're bad at don't tell them what they're what they're doing wrong on a daily basis no you lift them up to a higher standard and so here was this there was one and you all know the story he had his shoulders back his chest out brother Brenham said they didn't have to whip him in order to get him to work says I want to buy that guy oh he's not for sale well what do you do with him do you feed him differently you give him a little more protein no he eats with the rest at The Gallows do you does he sleep a little better than everybody else no no he sleeps with all the other slaves well what's so different about this guy this guy had the right attitude this guy had the right Spirit even though he was a slave in a foreign country and they come to find out that his dad and his family were were were were tribal Kings or whatever it was and he said he he he he acts his life and he lives his life out as the son of a king if you and I we've been born slaves to loudest ear let me tell you something we don't got to live like everybody else in L AA but we can live as Sons and Daughters of the king thank you Lord and it starts in our own homes am it starts in our own bedrooms it starts with our own family amen because when they see us living the right kind of life watching the right kind of things whatever it may be they'll want to live that same kind of life so here she was she had the right attitude and she said uh uh this little Maid she said to her mistress would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Sam Maria for he would recover him of his leprosy he would have a way of recovery he would have a way of atonement it wasn't him himself that was able to recover the person but he would have a way and an advice to give to this man who was stricken in sin to come and to wash and be clean of his leprosy so just follow along and one went in verse four and told his Lord saying thus and thus and he went and and and into the land of Israel and he took a letter to the King this is amazing she said go to the prophet but he went to the king yeah and no doubt it was a a form of respect for the king a form of respect to say hey uh I'm coming into your land but I'm coming peaceably here's a letter I don't have any other uh and uh other motives or objectives behind this thing here uh I just want to get healed of my disease but when the king received a letter he rent his clothes and and he said who am I I can't give life I can't take life away I can't heal this man of his disease he it was just interesting as I read it like why was his first thought not to go to Elisha the prophet it's because he didn't have a connction ction with Elisha the prophet it's because he didn't have a relationship with Elisha the prophet he was just doing his own thing and so we see that whenever non came and finally he made it to the prophet's house and my I I wondered this as I read and I thought how did Elisha know that the king rent his clothes and what he did because Elijah Elisha sent on to him hey hey why did you rent your clothes why did you get so angry why did you just send them to me you should have brought them to me in the first place why why are you so angry no doubt he saw it in a vision because there's nothing that's hid from God so we see that he came before before Elisha and he came to the man of God's house and no doubt here he is non he's got his he's got his horses and he's got his chariots and he's got all his his he's got a host of people with him and he's got 10 rment of of of clothing and he's got silver and he's got gold and and Men he's coming with a bunch of a bunch of presents to say thank you and and and he's already ready for his healing and and he thinks that Elisha is GNA come to the door and he's going to greet him and he's going to bow with respect and Elijah Elisha sends his gazi amen this guy sends his servant to the door and I traveled all this way doesn't he know who I am doesn't he know that I'm a respect person within the church doesn't he know that I have a position within the church who doesn't he know who I am doesn't he know who I belong to and he carries himself with an authority and demands respect of the people and Elisha sanses his servant to the door this disrespectful guy who does he think he is so now gazi comes with a with a uh a word he says go to the Jordan River and I want you to wash I want you to dip seven times the Jordan River you want me an honorable man a man of Valor a man that comes in and out before the king you want me to go and dip in that dirty river that dirty muddy river full of insects full of dirt full of grime there's way cleaner Waters where I live isn't that the way it is with us as Believers sometimes we think I know the way I know how it should be done I have a better idea and and and I think that we should do this and I think that this is the way but really this is the way the truth and the life and so we get so caught up with our own thoughts and our own ideas and our own agendas that we think how we want to do it is the right way but yet God has sent a prophet messenger in this day he didn't send some other kind of servant he sent a prophet messenger he didn't send the the messenger servant to you but he sent the messenger himself and he knocked on your door you didn't come looking for him but he came looking for you and he came and he told you a way to approach God a way to talk to God a way to have the right mental attitude towards the promises of God that they might come to pass in our lives he showed us the way the truth and the life But as time goes on I feel like as Believers we're getting away from the way amen we're getting away from the truth and therefore it's causing us to get away from the life we're getting away from the the the the the principle things that this messenger taught us we're getting away from Holiness in our dress we're getting away from Holiness in our lives we're getting away from uh uh staying out of questionable situations and the further out of the way we get the further away from the life we get we have to ask ourselves do we believe in the message of brother Bram or do we believe in brother Google do we believe in the message of this hour or do we believe in what the government is going to tell us do we believe in the message of this hour or are we going to try to live our lives according to how we feel we should serve the Lord I want to serve the Lord Lord according to this message because it is God the mystery of God revealed I think we've gotten too caught up with as just a man and we've listened to too many other voices of people that that say this that and the other and it's causing us to stray to stray out of the way am I've been thinking a lot lately on the last vision of the Bride and how brother brandham looked and and and he saw the first one come by and he says oh my goodness that's the church she was absolutely filthy rotten to look at why because she was following the Lord after her own ways after her own dogmas after her own concepts of God and therefore in the eyes of God she's wretched miserable naked and don't don't even know it right and so all of a sudden the bride came by and my he said there she is she's she she's got that long hair and she's clean and pretty and and all of the above but as he was looking at the Bride As she continued to walk on she began to get out of Step she began to get out of line she began to get out of the street and narrow way it doesn't mean that that that she was going to fall off that way but his last cry in that Vision was get back in line get back in step and that's where we are right now I believe that too much of the time we're getting out of line we're getting out of Step we're getting out of the way and it's causing us to get out of away from the life of God God help us I want a fresh outpouring of the holy spirit in my life because without the holy Spirit you can't walk in the way without the Holy Spirit you can't walk in the Life Hallelujah Lord I don't want to walk in my own ways because my own ways will lead me astray every time take me back to the word Lord take me back to the truth father because it is the way the truth and it's the life it's God's provided way you see say why are you always harping on a prophit for because it's God's provided way why are you always quoting what brother brandham quotes because it's God's provided way it's end time evangelism at this end time it's God's provided way so if you want to know what God says if you want to know what the way is pick up a message book man pick up your Bible and give it a good read no doubt some of you before God begin to open your eyes no doubt you read the Bible and you read the stories of the Bible and you thought wow Adam and Eve wow there was a magical tree and there was there was this magical Apple this magical apricot that they took a bite of and they realized we've just partook of sin that's denominational reading no doubt you read other stories within your scripture and you just took it for face value and you said wow I don't really understand that but that's good that's okay but when you read it through a prophetic Insight when you read it through prophetic glasses through the mind of God that is revealed through a prophetic messenger you look at the same stories you look at the same uh Bible characters and you say wow I'm reading between the lines I've heard and spoken by this messenger of this last day it wasn't no apple it was a relationship now you can look at uh the story of of Abraham and Sarah and you say wow they were changed back to a young man and to a young woman again how do we know these things because it's already been spoken through prophetic insight and let me say this unless you have prophetic hearing and a prophetic heart to receive a prophetic word you'll never receive it you'll never understand it so that's why brother brandham says my Bible became a new book it's not that the words changed it's not that the stories changed but it's that the illumination of your eyes is what changed you put on a pair of glasses and you said wow I can see clearly now the I can read between the lines of this love story but without the prophetic Insight we just read it as a newspaper without the Insight of Malachi 4 without the Insight of Revelations 10 1-7 there would be no Revelations 108 that's did you know that yes without the revelation of of of of Revelation 10 1-7 there would be no final voice in this final age because we would be saying what people said a couple of church ages ago we would be saying what people said under the man anointing we wouldn't be seeing what the eagle has declared in this last days so that's why we have a voice because there's a voice that already went before us and we're saying the same thing that that voice has already already spoken that's why brother Brenham said it's important to say only what I say on the tapes because the bride and the spirit say come we're saying the same thing that's already been spoken so if some of you were like I just wish there would be there would be ah some kind of great Revelation that would come forth that would help me overcome in life you're not going to get it it's already been spoken you just need a revelation of what's already been said and when God gives that Revelation that's where the power comes to overcome and laiaa this is a powerful quote brother brandham said this he said down through the last 2,000 years the Holy Ghost has been bound by denominational Creeds and doctrines but it has been loosed in these last days by the the last prophet messenger's message the trumpets of God that's where the quote is I think it's paragraph 241 or six somewhere in there go listen to it it's powerful yes but we're getting further away from it amen we're it's almost like we're embarrassed to say that we're message Believers that we believe that God sent a prophet that we believe his message that we believe it sent to turn our hearts back to the Faith of Our Pentecostal fathers am let me say this Mormons are not scared to share what they believe in don't be scared to share what you believe exactly my daughter Mariah the other day at school and uh and the teacher said uh the teacher said I'm so sad because I don't believ there there's not going to be any animals in heaven and so you know it's kind of hard for her to keep her hand down sometimes you know when you know the answer you want to I know I know I know I know and so she waited till the class was left and she went up to the teacher and she said teacher I have the answer for your for your thing you're wrong there will be animals in heaven and so the teacher gives her an audience as they do very nicely she said well tell me why you believe that and so Mariah she she started telling her well I believe that God sent a prophet messenger and he was the seventh Church age messenger and she started saying all these things and and he had a vision and he saw that his horse and his dog was in heaven and that's why we believe that there will be animals in heaven and she said thank you for sharing that I'll look into it yeah praise the Lord you just never know she might look into it and find something that she likes she might look into it and be a predestinated seed and say I believe that that's the truth tell me more elaser tell me more I want to know more of this Isaac that you've been telling me about so non he's mad he's wroth he's angry he's like he's telling me to wash in this dirty River ain't washing in no River here gets on his high horse and goes to leave and his servant hey his servants had a a little bit of wisdom behind them let me show you wisdom wisdom is not always calling something out at every opportunity you get but wisdom is this it's waiting for the right time and when you wait for the right time don't be scared to to call something out but if you just call something out all the time it's never going to be received all of the time so there's a right time and there's a right way and when the time is right don't shy away from it and so is his his servant had wisdom and he said hey uh uh you know if he had have told you to go do something really difficult if he had have told you to go slay some Giants and go uh go fast for 40 days or go do something that that's really all about your works you see it's not about our works and how much we can do and and how much we can work something up but it's relying on the way that's presented before us and the grace of God ah if he' have told you something difficult man you would have loved it you know why because it was his own Pride I did this did you see what I did you ever heard somebody talk like that did you see what I did for this person did you see what I did while serving the lord we ought to get away from I and say did you see what God did did you see what God did in that person's life that's the problem sometimes whenever uh you know you pray for somebody and they get well it's like wow I really got some Faith don't I I'm a Minister I anointed that person with oil and look what I did it ain't got nothing to do with you buddy it ain't got nothing to do with us it's by grace in Jesus Christ not by works that I have done or righteousness of my own God keep us humble pride is one of those things that we all deal with one way or another and I say father father help me with my pride amen I've said it before and I'll say it again I remember one time there was a brother said to me what do you think of that person's vehicle nice vehicle very nice it was very nice I said yeah it's very nice where I come from there's no way that we would have a vehicle like that so humble but yet it was his pride and his humility that he was missing he was so humble and he was being prideful with how humble he was but yet he was being prideful it's very interesting so whether we're humble or whether whether we short or whether we not all of us at one way or another deal with pride don't be so prideful that you can't ask for help amen because there's always someone that has the ability to help you amen amen so here he was and he begins to well I guess that's good counsel and he begins to take off his clothing and and no doubt his servants had never seen the sin in his life before they had never seen that part of leprosy on his body they had always seen him as this big strong and a warrior vant honorable but yet when he began to humble himself before the people around him and everybody began to look I had no idea I didn't know that he had that in his life but notice the Bible doesn't show us that they called him out and they said you secret Sinner and so on and so forth no they let him watch down one time and up he went down another time and he went up and no doubt the water was stinky and no doubt the water was muddy and it was filthy because the rivers of Jordan is a dirty River you know sometimes life can be muddy sometimes life can be dirty but as long as we're following in the ways of the Lord it'll all work out okay if he would have stopped at number five he would have never been healed if he would have stopped at number six he would have never been healed but when he went down the seventh time when he came up the Bible tells us that his skin was that of a child it wasn't because of his own Mighty works that he did but it's because he followed the footsteps and the words of the Lord for the day and the hour in which he was living in understand without f in the footsteps of this message that we believe there is no way back to Calvary you say there's no way to Calvary without the light of the day no it's a Calvary of another time it's a denominational Calvary it's a Jesus of the past not of the present it's a crucifying of the past not a crucifying of now he doesn't want us just to crucify of the past but he wants us to crucify ourselves on a daily basis brother brandham said this he said that only the elect can be reborn so what you're trying to tell me is others that are outside the Realms of of the elect how we would talk it you're trying to tell me that they cannot be born again absolutely facts they can be forgiven and they can have a relationship of a god of the past but to have a relationship with the god of now right now and his ways which are now there's no way outside of the light of your day amen amen amen so what do we do with it do we hide it under a bushel no I'm going to let it shine why is it important for us to let our light shines and not hide it under a bushel because we want people to get to Calvary so we find it nonon before non could be uh healed of this disease that before non could get rid of this sin in his life he had to do one thing first he had to Humble himself he had to Humble himself before his servants he had to Humble himself before Elisha he had to Humble himself before everybody that was out on the banks and was watching and realized that when he took these garments off that it would be there for all to see but whenever you mean business with God you don't care who's watching brother brandham tells this story about this woman one time and he and and he said uh uh she had an issue with smoking and she went to the brandham Tabernacle and he was telling the story I have prayed with her multiple times and I have she has come to the altar mult multiple times and she has prayed and prayed and and she has cried and she has gotten emotional and she has done all these things but she could just never get over this demon of cigarettes and so brother brandham took her aside one time and he said okay sister let's pray and we find out that she was praying and she was she was she actually got sick and she was dying they said she had cancer isn't it amazing that it can say on a cigarette package causes cancer but yet millions of people will still stand and smoke a cigarette I'll take my chances isn't it amazing that we can see a lot of the the processed junk in this food that we partake of and we know what it causes but yet we're so addicted to it that we can't get away from it I say God help us because our bodies is what it's a temple and it is a temple of the Holy Ghost when we become Believers we don't go out and we don't get tattoos we don't go out and Pierce our ears and put a a nose ring in our ear no in our nose no because we believe that our body is a temple of the Holy Ghost let's narrow it down just a little bit more and take inventory of the processed junk that is absolutely killing our human bodies and say F and say you know what this is absolutely terrible for me I'm going to pass nobody said amen look at that you bunch of processed eating ice cream lovers cocacola drinkers all the lovealls are like I can't give up my ice cream [Laughter] rocky road all day long but we need to take a little bit of inventory I've been trying that's why I can preach it been trying for a little bit and it's good it's good for you drink a little more water instead of a soda it makes you feel good drink a little more water instead of a Red Bull or a monster guys you won't crash at 2:00 guys are all laugh because you know it's true do a Donald Trump here you see where was I eating ice cream you may be dismissed and ice cream's on brother Ezra I'm [Laughter] sorry that's one of those things where it's like a personal thing huh you can either take it or leave it but there's a little spiritual aspect to it there absolutely so now we see that that uh that non was not eating ice cream but he humbled himself that's where he was thank you Lord he humbled himself before the people and he realized ized I'm going to Bear all before these many people and my servants and Elijah and Gesa and everybody that's watching I'm going to Bear all and I'm going to go and I'm going to dip because I want to get well that's where I was going brother so brother brandom the woman with the woman that was smoking and had cancer she was on her deathbed and so she's she's getting all shriveled up or whatever and she's losing weight and so on and so forth and brother brandom said well let me pray for you let's pray together and he had her pray and so she prayed and she prayed and and she said she was done and she cried and she got emotional and she got up and she said she was done brother Bram said no you're not done you didn't break through to where you should have brother bradam sat down with her and then he prayed and she prayed and she prayed until she broke through the barrier she broke through that spirit that has been holding her this whole time and she had prayed and she had cried before and she had boohoo and she had gotten emotional but whenever she had gotten sick onto death her prayer meant business some of you might say I've been bound up by spirits of loua I'm bound up with drink I'm bound up with smoke I'm bound up with with with the complexes that this that this world uh gives us on a daily basis and I've tried and I've prayed and I've tried to overcome and I can't overcome I have prayed and I have fasted and I have done this and I've done that my brother and my sister we need to get down to business it's not just until you cry though that's a part of repentance but it's until you break through that thing that has you bound then you'll be changed from that time forth I say father give some of us a break breakthrough give us a time of prayer where we're not worried about what's going on let us be like brother Mike Patterson that when our family sees the light is on in our prayer closet that they know not to bother us I thought that was amazing a lot of you weren't there so I'll share it brother Mike brother Robert and I were talking about it in the back we didn't know this about brother Mike that brother Mike was a real prayer Warrior you know it's interesting when you see a man I only knew brother Mike the the last 2 and a half years and you see a man and you see his decline in health and you see his uh perhaps uh mental Clarity decline but yet he still loved the Lord and and and when we look at that we think okay we'll have Grace on brother Mike but when he was in his prime when he was in his Heyday he was a prayer Warrior he was a warrior for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and every time and and I can just give a rose here to brother Mike whenever he would whenever after I was done preaching and we would talk he would always try to encourage you his conversation would always try to be about the Lord Jesus Christ even when his mental capacities was failing him his heart still loved the Lord and so brother Mike had a had a place where he would go in the woods and he would go and he would pray he had a place at home his little office and his daughter gave the the testimony that whenever whenever Daddy's light was on in the office you knew to be quiet and you knew not to bother him because he was praying to the Lord we need some of that in our lives I need some of that in my life we all need some of it in our lives we need to stop getting so caught up with the cares of this world with the cares that choke out the seed that dwells within us and set some time aside to pray and seek the Lord all of us cuz if I was that it would be easier for me to ask who's not busy than ask who's busy because we're all busy but we need to be disciplined with our time God help us and so let me I have a quote here let me see uh influence 1963 and brother bram's talking about Uzziah he says God smote him with Leprosy the man died in his leprosy which is a type of sin he couldn't stand to be corrected by the word so Uzziah could not humble himself and bring himself under the authority of the word that said hey you're out of your please don't do that but he was just so prideful that he couldn't come subjective under the his Pastor he couldn't come subjective and he said ah I'm going to do what I want God smoted him with Leprosy brother Brandon said here it's a type of sin he couldn't stand to be corrected paragraph 88 in the same service what happened to this King a great man a Believer a God blessed man he was smitten with Leprosy which is a type of sin unbelief no cure for it only Christ and he died in that same shape so we see that there's no uh there is no cure for leprosy which is a type of sin there's no cure for sin in this day only through Jesus Christ and so how do I come to Jesus Christ I come with a broken and contrite spirit I come with a repenting and humble heart and I say father I'm wrong I've done wrong I've thought wrong I've said wrong I'm going to apologize to you I'm going to apologize to my family because I want the cure for sin in my life where there's no repentance there's no recovery and there's no forgiveness of sin Hallelujah say you're only talking to the brother Stephen mm no you remember the time sister sister ma she was all she got all uh uh man she was all stressed out and she told Brother brandom to correct uh Joseph you remember the story she slammed the door brother brandham said he didn't like that you remember what caused the sickness that came from that she had a tumor why because she failed to respect her husband she overreacted because she got emotional which is a woman thing to do huh guys do the same thing I guess too but we overreact in different ways but because she failed to respect her husband and the gift that was surrounding her God caused this tumor to come in her life I wonder sometimes are we sick and body as Believers because we fail to respect one another amen so he did seven times and he came up and his sin his flesh was back to what it was as he was a child when I when we all think of seven in the scripture we think wow seven Church age Messengers seven Church ages and we begin to tie this all back together and I wondered what is what what is it trying to show us within the scripture here of Why seven times and why after the seventh time was he made clean back to what he was before because this first church age bride and the last Church age bride is going to be the same she was pure and spotless at the beginning and at the end she is also going to be pure and spotless it is no coincidence that brother brandham at the time of brother branham's life that they would come up with this chemical called bleach and we all think of bleach and everybody knows about bleach but listen to what brother bradam says here about bleach God hiding himself in Simplicity well let's look at that little ink and see where it come from now it's ink it's been put together and chemicals and so forth till it's become ink and it's black you drop it on your clothes it'll stain but we manufactured the stuff called bleach you women use Clorox bleach well I take that one drop of ink and drop it onto the tub of bleach now what happened to the ink see bleach has been manufactured invented and manufactured chemicals together that will break up that coloring so bad till you can't find it no part of the bleach is water water is H2O which is hydrogen and oxide and oxygen and both hydrogen and oxygen both are dangerous explosives and hydrogen and oxygen is actually ashes that's what it is that's right chemical ashes now put it together and you got water but break it up you got hydrogen and oxygen and just keep on going back now in getting in this now there might be C sitting here he says there will be cus listen at this I don't know the formula but I just want to explain it in my own humble way trusting that God will reveal himself in it look I drop that drop of ink into bleach what happens immediately the black stain is gone you couldn't find it again if you had to it's gone you'll never see it no more what's happened now you don't see nothing come up from it that he's saying there's no little trail of anything there's there's nothing it's gone has disappeared this black ink that was once there is no longer there because of this Clorox bleach he says you don't why don't you because it's broke up he says now science would say it turned back to its original acids what did acids come from I think brother Brandon was a chemist he says for instance fumes made acids where did fumes come from it it was all fumes made by molecules where did molecules come from from atoms where did atoms come from from electrons where did they come from cosmic light see you're back you're Plumb back a past finding of cists now and if it is a substance and a creation it has to come from a Creator and so here he was he dips seven times he comes up and his flesh his sin is completely annihilated it's not there anymore it was once there for everybody to see but now it'll be forgotten about why because he followed the paths of the messenger of that age so let me ask you about your sin we've all came short of the glory of God we've all did things wrong we've all said things wrong we've all told lies we've done many things that perhaps we're as the musicians come what that were that we would be embarrassed for everybody to see here this morning but the blood of Jesus Christ is stronger than any Clorox bleach that they can manufacture that's why this age of laa it is an age of the revelation of justification if he would have dipped six times his sin still would have been there if he would have dipped five times representing the fifth Church age his sins would have been still there fourth third second first but because it came to this seventh Church age this loudan church age that we're now living in with a true revelation of true justification in the lives of the Believers there was no Trace that was found in his life there's no ink that can be found there's no little Trail there's no little speck he dropped that ink in a thing of bleach it's not there anymore where does it go to it goes back and it goes back and it goes back and it goes back and it goes back and it goes back until it can go back no further until it goes back to the very Mind Of God but when your sins are plunged beneath the blood of Jesus Christ with true justification in our lives it is a r from the very Mind Of God himself so take it back as far as you want to go back as far as you want to in your family life in your family history that has family complexes that has family shortcomings take it back as far as you want it's done with amen the sin question has been answered Jesus Christ God's own son by the shedding of his blood has forgiven us of all sins and all iniquities you say well what about my shortcomings what about them have you been born again say Stephen what about this and what about that and what about the other my question to you back to you is have you been born again and if you have been born again by the spirit of God and you've been plunged beneath the Clorox bleach of the blood let it alone leave it in the past stop going fishing stop looking for something and when things come back to your memory instead of dwelling upon the memory say father thank you for what you've brought me from thank you from what to what you brought me through that is part of the past of Steven mcney that is the part of the past of where I came from yes that is a part of who I who I was but now I'm someone different I have the mind of Christ I've been born again by the spirit of God my desires aren't the same anymore therefore I'm going to walk in Freedom and I'm going to walk in Liberty when I have the memories come back to me I'm going to say this thank you Jesus thank you God for what you've done in my life thank you for forgiving me thank you for setting me free Hallelujah don't dwell don't let Satan dwell in your mind upon past mistakes don't let your past mistakes ah what am I trying to say don't let it control your future don't let it control who you are now amen and I'll say this and then I'll close to those of you
