[35:28] surrendering our all to the king is not
[35:30] just a one-time affair
[35:33] it almost feels like it has to happen on
[35:36] a daily basis that we have to remind
[35:38] ourselves I've already surrendered that
[35:41] to the king so I'm not going to be like
[35:44] a dog going back to my vomit I'm not
[35:48] going to be like a pig going back to its
[35:50] Waller but I've put the past behind me
[35:53] I've surrendered my life and so now I'm
[35:56] going to live my life not for myself but
[35:59] for the king Hallelujah let's pray
[36:02] together father God we certainly
[36:05] appreciate this time that we can be
[36:07] gathered together and Lord your word
[36:10] says that we're two or three are
[36:12] gathered in my name there I'll be in
[36:15] their midst and we know Lord that when
[36:17] you're in the midst of us that you bring
[36:19] a blessing each and every time like
[36:21] brother Sean prayed you are a
[36:24] supernatural God and because you are
[36:27] Supernatural it means that you are
[36:29] unusual and so father we pray that
[36:32] Supernatural naturally unusually Lord
[36:35] you would come and that you would meet
[36:37] with each individual tonight where we're
[36:40] sitting that you would speak to our
[36:42] hearts Lord that you would change our
[36:44] lives father for this is our desire we
[36:47] ask that the word father would have an
[36:49] effect in our lives
[36:54] Lord we're confessing that
[36:57] we have a seat Gene within us
[37:01] and Lord is beginning to manifest and
[37:03] it's beginning to bring forth but the
[37:06] only thing that can make it bring forth
[37:08] more Lord is the watering of your spirit
[37:11] the anointing father that whatever life
[37:15] lays in there it might be made manifest
[37:18] so we pray father as we're living in a
[37:22] in a dry desert
[37:24] 115 degrees Lord may you come and water
[37:28] us afresh this evening
[37:30] we ask it for thy Kingdom's glory in
[37:33] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[37:37] you this evening it's good to be in the
[37:39] house of the Lord thank you so much
[37:41] musicians and um
[37:44] I got a a little text there from brother
[37:47] Ron while I was in the back and he asked
[37:49] me to greet the Saints they're up in
[37:52] Salt Lake City there brother Ron and
[37:54] sister Sandy it's their 50th year
[37:56] anniversary so let's give them a big
[37:58] warm hand
[38:01] [Applause]
[38:06] s 50 years my goodness that is quite the
[38:10] Milestone isn't it we're so blessed to
[38:12] have a pastor that leads by example
[38:15] we're so blessed to have an example that
[38:18] is set before us as we see people they
[38:21] can't make it past five ten years but
[38:24] here we have a pastor and his wife who
[38:28] are faithful to the body and faithful to
[38:30] each other and what an example that is
[38:32] for us as Believers to follow and we
[38:36] just trust that uh they would have a
[38:38] real nice time up there and enjoying the
[38:40] nice weather I'm sure
[38:42] um Community the sanctuary is almost
[38:45] complete just a few more
[38:48] um touch-ups and a few more things to
[38:51] happen here and there but my goodness it
[38:53] is looking really nice and you're all
[38:56] going to love it so much and I wouldn't
[38:59] be surprised if you pick a different
[39:00] seat to sit in when you go because it
[39:03] just looks completely different and so
[39:06] the law Lord willing on Sunday morning
[39:08] we will have service
[39:10] in the church not right here so if you
[39:14] come here there might be a sign on the
[39:16] door
[39:16] go to the church and um I believe that
[39:20] brother Steve Clark is ministering for
[39:22] us on Sunday also so that'll be a real
[39:25] blessing for us if you have your Bible
[39:28] turn with me to the Book of Daniel
[39:30] chapter 2
[39:32] and we'll read verses 36 through 45.
[39:44] Daniel chapter 2 and verse 36 it says
[39:48] this is the dream and we will tell the
[39:49] interpretation thereof before the king
[39:51] Thou King art a king of kings for the
[39:55] god of Heaven hath given thee Kingdom
[39:57] power and strength and glory and
[40:00] wheresoever the children of men dwell
[40:03] the beasts of the field and the fowls of
[40:06] the heaven hath he given into thine hand
[40:08] and has made thee ruler over them all
[40:10] thou art is head of gold
[40:13] and after thee shall arise another
[40:15] kingdom inferior to thee and another
[40:17] third Kingdom of brass which shall bear
[40:20] rule over all the earth and the fourth
[40:23] Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as
[40:25] much as iron breakouts and pieces and
[40:28] subdueth all things and as iron that
[40:31] breakth all these shall it break in
[40:34] pieces and bruise and whereas thou saws
[40:37] defeat and toes
[40:39] part of Potter's clay and part of iron
[40:43] the kingdom shall be divided but there
[40:46] shall be in it of the strength of the
[40:48] iron for as much as thou saws the iron
[40:51] mixed with Miry clay
[40:54] and as the toes of the feet were part of
[40:56] iron and part of clay so the kingdom
[40:58] shall be broken partly strong and partly
[41:01] broken and whereas thou sawst iron mixed
[41:05] with Miri clay they shall mingle
[41:07] themselves with the seed of men but they
[41:10] shall not cleave one to another even as
[41:12] iron is not mixed with clay and in the
[41:15] days of these Kings shall God Of Heaven
[41:17] set up a kingdom which shall never be
[41:20] destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
[41:22] left
[41:23] to other people but it shall break in
[41:26] pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[41:29] and it shall stand forever and everybody
[41:32] said amen
[41:34] for as much as thou saw us that the
[41:36] stone was cut out of the mountain
[41:38] without hands and that it break in
[41:40] pieces the iron the brass the clay the
[41:43] silver and gold the great God has made
[41:46] known to the king what shall come to
[41:48] pass Hereafter and the dream is certain
[41:51] and the interpretation thereof sure you
[41:55] may be seated this evening
[41:58] terms mean your Bibles to Revelation
[42:01] chapter 13.
[42:04] very familiar portion of scripture and
[42:07] we'll read verses 11. through 14.
[42:14] Revelation chapter 13 and verse 11 and
[42:17] it says and I beheld another Beast
[42:19] coming up out of the earth and he had
[42:22] two horns like a lamb and he spake as a
[42:24] dragon and the exercises all the power
[42:28] of the first Beast before him and
[42:31] causeth the Earth and them which dwell
[42:34] therein to worship the first Beast whose
[42:37] deadly wound was healed
[42:40] and he doeth great wonders so that he
[42:43] maketh Fire come down from heaven on the
[42:46] earth in the sight of men and deceiveth
[42:49] them that dwell
[42:50] on the Earth by the means of those
[42:53] Miracles which he had powered to do in
[42:56] the sight of the Beast saying to them
[42:58] that dwell in the earth that they should
[43:00] make an image to the Beast which had the
[43:03] wound by a sword
[43:05] and did live amen
[43:08] I would like to
[43:10] continue on this thought of God's School
[43:14] of humility and this is part two
[43:18] and we find out that
[43:21] humility in this day in which we're
[43:24] living is a characteristic or an art it
[43:29] is it is something that has been left
[43:32] out of the human race these past
[43:35] Generations it's very hard to find a
[43:39] person with god-given humility it is
[43:43] very hard to find a person that is
[43:46] humble in their ways is not just uh no
[43:50] I'm not just talking about somebody who
[43:52] walks around with their head down and
[43:54] their eyes towards the ground and and
[43:56] and they have a a manufactured
[43:59] humbleness but I'm talking about a true
[44:03] humility and when you find someone that
[44:06] has a true humility in their lives their
[44:10] Spirit actually Bears record of that
[44:13] humility and because they have a spirit
[44:16] of humility we find that now
[44:19] you can watch their life and you can
[44:21] watch the attributes of their life and
[44:24] it just brings forth an aroma of
[44:28] humility
[44:30] you would go find it very hard in this
[44:33] time to find somebody
[44:36] I that that truly has a genuine
[44:41] attribute of humility in their lives
[44:44] especially in the world
[44:47] humility in the world is seen as a
[44:50] person who is soft
[44:52] a person who is weak a person who cannot
[44:56] stand up for themselves a person that
[44:59] doesn't know how to fight ah you're just
[45:02] weak you're just soft
[45:04] that's how the world sees humility
[45:07] but brother Branham said that God
[45:10] actually dwells in humility
[45:14] and so if we are professed to be the
[45:18] Bride of Jesus Christ and we profess
[45:21] that we are bone of his bone and flesh
[45:23] flesh of his flesh if we profess that we
[45:26] are his body and he is our head and he
[45:29] dwells in humility how should the Bride
[45:33] of Jesus Christ be acting in this day
[45:36] she should be walking a life of humility
[45:43] in Hebrews chapter 4 19
[45:46] 57 brother Branham said I love you
[45:50] it goes to show that you're interested
[45:52] enough you don't have to come to an
[45:54] air-conditioned building to hear the
[45:56] gospel you're hungry enough to come to a
[45:59] place like this God never would let us
[46:01] build nothing but this we love it this
[46:05] way just a little old shack but that's
[46:08] the way we love it God don't dwell in
[46:10] glamor
[46:12] God dwells in humility so God is Not
[46:16] dwelling in the glamor and the Fashions
[46:19] of this world and the things that
[46:21] sparkle and the nice vehicles and the
[46:23] nice houses and even the nice churches
[46:26] but God dwells in one thing and that's
[46:29] humility
[46:31] God keep us humble
[46:34] we find out that that's why God has to
[46:37] put us through this school of humility
[46:40] because within ourselves and in our
[46:43] carnal flesh we're prideful
[46:46] we've got so much arrogance
[46:48] we got so much pride in our lives we're
[46:51] we're all about the big guys and the
[46:53] little use which is contrary to God's
[46:56] word which is contrary to the place
[46:59] where God dwells but God wants to dwell
[47:02] in a human vessel that is surrounded
[47:05] with humility
[47:10] it's so easy to get puffed up
[47:12] it's so easy to have a stuffed shirt
[47:14] just watch God bless a man or a woman
[47:17] and watch somebody who started out in
[47:20] humility whether it be in their own
[47:22] Ministry are in their own life all of a
[47:25] sudden hey they start out with their
[47:27] life and they drive a little beat up car
[47:31] I remember
[47:33] my first car in the U.S that I ever had
[47:36] and that thing was a six hundred dollar
[47:39] hot rod
[47:40] it had a massive big old pipe and it was
[47:43] just a police magnet
[47:46] it had no AC in it
[47:52] we had humble beginnings
[47:54] but watch God now take a person not
[47:59] talking about myself
[48:01] because I am very humble as you see
[48:04] take a person that starts off with
[48:07] humble beginnings and let them and let
[48:09] them be blessed and let their family be
[48:11] blessed and all of a sudden they won't
[48:13] go to that person's house or they used
[48:15] to Fellowship any with anymore
[48:17] because they're of a a higher degree
[48:19] they're they're they're they're of a
[48:21] higher uh what you may call it
[48:24] um status in life they're of a higher
[48:28] status within the church God help us
[48:31] if some of you were pried because of the
[48:34] materialistic things you have I pray
[48:37] that God humbles you
[48:39] I pray that he gives you a blowout on
[48:41] your tire I pray that something happens
[48:44] in your car why because God doesn't want
[48:47] a prideful arrogant spirit
[48:50] he wants somebody who's humble
[48:53] but we find out that it's interesting
[48:56] the only way that God can keep us humble
[48:58] in our humanity is through the trials of
[49:01] life
[49:03] we wonder why God why why is this
[49:06] happening why is this happening to us
[49:09] I'll tell you why because you're too
[49:11] prideful
[49:15] so now God has to take us through a
[49:18] school
[49:19] it's not a School of Hard Knocks
[49:22] because when we go through a School of
[49:24] Hard Knocks guess what it just makes us
[49:25] bitter
[49:27] it makes us with a heart of
[49:29] disappointment it takes us to a place
[49:31] where we're just not satisfied in our in
[49:34] our hearts and in our souls
[49:39] Hallelujah I'm like jumping two sermons
[49:42] ahead
[49:43] but that's okay
[49:44] you didn't know until I told you
[49:50] so why is it that God has to take this
[49:52] this human flesh and he has to break it
[49:55] apart he has to put us through the
[49:57] trials of laodiacia because he wants to
[50:01] dwell within your heart
[50:04] and when our heart is full of pride and
[50:07] arrogance the Holy Spirit can't dwell
[50:09] there
[50:11] so we find that whenever we whenever we
[50:15] look at this uh uh this statue
[50:19] of this dream of Nebuchadnezzar
[50:22] we see that it represents the Gentiles
[50:25] Gentile dispensation it represents the
[50:29] kingdoms of the Gentiles from uh from
[50:33] the time of Babylon until the very time
[50:35] that we are living in but it also
[50:38] represents our body of humanity
[50:42] it represents our flesh man and it's
[50:46] just so funny because we are so into
[50:49] ourselves
[50:51] we're so into our carnal man we we put a
[50:54] nice suit on them we we want to make
[50:56] sure that our hair looks nice and and we
[50:59] want everything to look nice which is
[51:00] nice but in doing so we become prideful
[51:05] and arrogant within our Spirits do you
[51:09] know how much God thinks of our carnal
[51:11] man
[51:13] brother Branham said that we're just a
[51:15] bunch of dirt bags
[51:18] what was it he said you're worth about
[51:20] 50 cents whatever it is
[51:22] he says and here we are we get out here
[51:24] and we really think we are something we
[51:27] really think that we are somebody and we
[51:30] really think that we're doing something
[51:32] in in this life but God cares absolutely
[51:35] nothing about this carnal man
[51:39] because there was a stone that the
[51:41] builders rejected and that stone that
[51:44] came and had crushed this image this
[51:47] Gentile Kingdom what does the word of
[51:49] God do to our flesh man
[51:52] it crushes him
[51:54] it annihilates him it breaks them apart
[51:57] why because the carnal man and the
[52:00] spiritual man it cannot co-mingle
[52:02] together how can you serve God and
[52:05] Mammon at the same time how can you
[52:08] serve two masters at the same time how
[52:11] can bitter and sweet water come out of
[52:13] the same whale at the same time
[52:18] the one has got to live and the other
[52:21] one has got to die
[52:23] now notice the difference
[52:26] that when God breaks a person
[52:29] when he takes them through the school of
[52:32] uh not hard knocks but the school of
[52:36] humility
[52:37] there's something very special that
[52:40] happens to that person
[52:43] because when God breaks down this carnal
[52:46] man he just doesn't leave him in a
[52:48] broken state
[52:50] but he wants to take the clay and put it
[52:53] back on the potter's wheel one more time
[52:55] and he wants to mold the clay into the
[52:59] image of what the Potter has had in his
[53:02] mind before the foundations of the world
[53:05] so when God breaks a person down he's
[53:08] doing it that he might rebuild them and
[53:11] bring them into the very image of Christ
[53:13] it's called the stature of a perfect man
[53:18] he starts them off by faith and then he
[53:21] goes to knowledge and virtue and
[53:23] brotherly kindness and all these
[53:25] different attributes that God has within
[53:27] the seed
[53:30] he doesn't leave a person broken
[53:33] but he builds them up again
[53:35] but there are others
[53:37] who are broken
[53:39] and the reason why they're broken is
[53:41] because they get out from behind the
[53:44] protection of God's word
[53:47] and when a person gets out from behind
[53:50] to protection of the word guess what
[53:52] when they're broken they're in a
[53:54] backslidden state
[53:56] and when they're in a backslidden state
[53:58] and they're broken in their spirit in
[54:01] their life and their financial lives
[54:03] that makes them become bitter in their
[54:06] life
[54:09] because of wrong choices
[54:11] but when God breaks a person that person
[54:15] doesn't run away from God
[54:17] that person doesn't point the finger at
[54:19] God and say look what you did to me look
[54:22] what you did to my family look what you
[54:25] did to my loved ones why did you do this
[54:28] God no when God breaks a person it
[54:32] brings him in a closer relationship with
[54:35] God it puts them on their knees
[54:38] it puts them in a place of desperation
[54:41] and saying God I don't understand this
[54:44] but I love you
[54:46] do you see the difference
[54:49] so now you can look at the attributes of
[54:52] the life
[54:53] just because somebody goes through
[54:55] trials and temptations and situations it
[54:58] doesn't mean anything bad
[55:00] necessarily
[55:03] problem is we got too many uh job's
[55:06] friends
[55:08] in the assembly
[55:11] ah you've got secret sin in your life I
[55:14] know it why would God cause your life to
[55:17] fall apart in such a way why would God
[55:19] cause you to have this sickness that
[55:21] never seems that you can get over you've
[55:24] got secret sin in your life and they
[55:26] begin to point fingers but notice what
[55:29] the trial did in job's life
[55:32] Hallelujah
[55:34] he he got to a point and he said though
[55:37] these skin worms eat my flesh he sat on
[55:40] a on a on a on a heap on the ground and
[55:44] he was scraping his boils his family was
[55:46] taken away from him
[55:48] but yet he said I know my redeemer
[55:51] liveth I know that I'll see him one day
[55:55] in this flesh this situation is just
[55:58] temporary in my life and I know that I'm
[56:01] innocent before God if you know you're
[56:04] innocent before God it doesn't matter
[56:05] what anybody else says
[56:09] so what did the situation do it brought
[56:11] an attribute out of his life
[56:13] that caused him to call on God it caused
[56:16] him to seek God but it didn't cause him
[56:19] to run away from God
[56:21] now notice Adam and Eve
[56:23] in the Book of Genesis
[56:26] the same thing was happening to them
[56:28] wrong choices
[56:31] they made a wrong choice in their life
[56:33] and because of that they were banished
[56:35] from the Garden of Eden but what did
[56:37] they do when sin entered into their
[56:39] lives
[56:40] they hit themselves
[56:42] they ran from God
[56:45] how are you going to run from God
[56:47] where are you going to run to
[56:51] oh if I go to the deepest depths of Hell
[56:54] Lord you're there if I go to this place
[56:57] Lord you're there what's the point in
[57:00] running
[57:03] so now you can look at a person's life
[57:05] and by their characteristics of how
[57:09] they're going through the situation you
[57:12] can tell what's going on in their lives
[57:15] you can say this person is being broken
[57:18] of God so that they might be rebuilt
[57:21] stronger and in a formable image in the
[57:25] image of the Potter's mind or look at
[57:28] the attitude of the person
[57:36] now brother Branham said that Babylon
[57:40] through Nimrod as the beginning of all
[57:43] idolatry
[57:44] Pagan mythology worship and when did it
[57:48] start it started in Genesis as the head
[57:50] of gold and it ends up in the feet now
[57:54] we realize that brother Branham said
[57:55] that footsteps are possession meaning
[57:58] that this form of religion and of
[58:02] idolatry that began in the head now goes
[58:05] down to the feet and this this worship
[58:10] of idolatry now has spread throughout
[58:13] the whole entire world
[58:19] this Babylon spirit that started in
[58:21] Genesis
[58:22] it ends up in the Book of Revelation
[58:27] now we have to remember that though we
[58:29] can put a name to it and we can say
[58:32] Nimrod we understand that it wasn't just
[58:36] Nimrod as a person
[58:39] but it was a spirit that was driving
[58:42] Nimrod because the man that had the name
[58:45] Nimrod is dead and buried
[58:49] he's not with us no longer but the
[58:51] spirit that began there is the Same
[58:54] Spirit of idolatry it is the same Spirit
[58:57] of paganism that continues now to down
[59:02] to the Book of Revelation to this very
[59:05] Church age that we're living in
[59:10] we understand that he was just a man
[59:13] that was acting out
[59:15] whatever attributes and characteristics
[59:18] of the spirit that dwelt within his life
[59:25] even though the man died the spirit
[59:27] never died
[59:28] brother Branham said that God will take
[59:31] his man but he'll never take the spirit
[59:36] and the devil does the same thing his
[59:38] man might go off the Earth but the
[59:41] spirit lives on
[59:43] I'm so glad that there's coming a day
[59:46] and it's called the Lake of Fire that
[59:49] all these spirits that bombard us and
[59:52] give us such a hard time on a daily
[59:55] basis they're going to be cast into that
[59:57] fire never to bother us no more
[1:00:04] but until that day
[1:00:06] we have a fight on our hands
[1:00:10] the end the sign of the time 1958
[1:00:13] brother Branham said
[1:00:15] and the first thing you know some little
[1:00:17] painted face Jezebel looked around and
[1:00:19] said what's the matter and then she was
[1:00:22] All Shook Up and then he thought well
[1:00:25] now wait a minute no one can get in the
[1:00:27] gate the guards are at the gate no one
[1:00:30] can get over the wall we got the wall
[1:00:32] lit but God can look down God hates sin
[1:00:36] and loves the sinner
[1:00:39] he hates the sin he loves America but he
[1:00:43] hates her sin
[1:00:46] he loves his church
[1:00:49] but he hates the sin in the church
[1:00:53] let me say this that God loves you but
[1:00:57] he hates the sin that so easily besets
[1:01:00] you that's in your life
[1:01:06] he says he hates the sin and the church
[1:01:08] but it hasn't changed Spirit don't die
[1:01:12] the same Spirits was in them people are
[1:01:15] in these people today the devil takes
[1:01:18] his man but never his Spirit God takes
[1:01:21] his man but never his spirit
[1:01:25] talking about spirits real quick we
[1:01:28] realize that in the Garden of Eden until
[1:01:31] Satan had entered into the Beast the
[1:01:34] Beast had never done any harm
[1:01:36] but it wasn't until Satan had entered
[1:01:40] himself into the Beast it wasn't until
[1:01:43] that time that he began to manipulate
[1:01:47] and work on the reasonings of Eve
[1:01:50] it wasn't until Judas Iscariot until
[1:01:54] Satan entered into the heart of Judas
[1:01:57] that's when he betrayed the Lord before
[1:02:01] that Spirit entered into him he was part
[1:02:05] of the disciples he was part of the work
[1:02:07] of God he cast out devils
[1:02:11] he prayed for the sick he did all these
[1:02:13] different things why because that Spirit
[1:02:16] had not entered into his heart yet but
[1:02:18] when that Spirit Satan had entered into
[1:02:21] his life it caused him to bring forth an
[1:02:25] attribute of betrayal
[1:02:28] because Satan in the beginning he
[1:02:30] betrayed God
[1:02:37] we can look at within the scriptures how
[1:02:40] that you remember the time when there
[1:02:43] was the prophets and they were
[1:02:45] prophesying and and uh and and and and
[1:02:48] and God said who who shall we send
[1:02:52] and there was a lion spirit that was
[1:02:55] sent from the presence of God and he
[1:02:57] said I'll go and I'll cause them to
[1:03:01] prophesy a lie
[1:03:03] until the spirit entered into those
[1:03:06] prophets it caused them to prophesy a
[1:03:10] lie and so we find out that Spirits now
[1:03:14] a lot of people are manifesting the
[1:03:17] spirit that dwells within their lives
[1:03:22] so it is with the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:03:25] why do we do what we do because we have
[1:03:29] the spirit of God that dwells within us
[1:03:31] why do we have this desire to live a
[1:03:35] clean holy Sanctified life because he is
[1:03:38] a clean holy Sanctified God and when his
[1:03:42] Spirit dwells within us we want to do
[1:03:45] what the spirit is telling us to do
[1:03:48] why do you believe in miracles because
[1:03:51] he's a miracle-working God why do you
[1:03:54] believe in the power of the spoken word
[1:03:57] because in the beginning he spoke his
[1:04:00] word that's why we believe it
[1:04:03] so why do you do what you do why are you
[1:04:06] the way you are because I am how I am
[1:04:09] because he was as he was
[1:04:13] I do what I do
[1:04:15] because he did the same also
[1:04:21] Hallelujah
[1:04:23] the spirit of God
[1:04:26] will make you act and do things that
[1:04:27] you're carnal man would never thought
[1:04:29] was possible
[1:04:32] what are you talking about brother
[1:04:33] Stephen are you talking about speaking
[1:04:35] in tongues Maybe
[1:04:39] but what I'm talking about is this
[1:04:42] that when somebody Smite you on the
[1:04:44] cheek what does the carnal man want to
[1:04:46] do
[1:04:47] he wants to thump him
[1:04:49] somebody cut you off on the road
[1:04:52] somebody steps on your toes so what is
[1:04:55] the carnal man what's his first reaction
[1:04:58] eye for an eye on a tooth for a tooth
[1:05:01] man
[1:05:03] that's my first reaction but when the
[1:05:05] spirit of God takes over
[1:05:08] when somebody does something against
[1:05:10] your family what does the carnal man
[1:05:12] want to do he wants to hate the person
[1:05:15] I'll never talk to that person ever in
[1:05:17] my life again why because they did thus
[1:05:20] and thus to me but when the spirit of
[1:05:22] God has preeminence in the life of a
[1:05:25] Believer what does the believer say Lord
[1:05:27] forgive them for they don't know what
[1:05:30] they did oh you want me to walk a mile
[1:05:32] with you I'll go too with you
[1:05:36] it'll make you do things that you never
[1:05:38] thought was possible it'll make you
[1:05:41] think things towards people that you
[1:05:43] never thought was possible why because
[1:05:46] it's the spirit of God
[1:05:53] now when we read the fruit notes in our
[1:05:55] Bible
[1:05:56] it's plain to see that most historians
[1:06:00] are on the same page of the the order of
[1:06:04] this of the Gentile dispensation
[1:06:06] starting off with Babylon and going on
[1:06:09] to the means of Persians and going on to
[1:06:12] the grecians and into the Roman Empire
[1:06:14] you find it you can read it in your
[1:06:16] footnotes of the Bible
[1:06:18] most historians will agree on these
[1:06:21] things but now it took a prophet to take
[1:06:24] this this stature this dream this this
[1:06:28] vision of the of of the Gentile
[1:06:30] dispensation and take it from history
[1:06:34] and and bring it into a a modern event
[1:06:37] being made clear by prophecy
[1:06:41] notice this
[1:06:43] the Feast of the trumpets 1964. notice
[1:06:47] quickly now
[1:06:48] these Supernatural demons wow
[1:06:52] under the auspices of a United Nation
[1:06:55] United groups together eastern and
[1:06:58] western notice what brother Branham
[1:07:00] called them
[1:07:01] Supernatural
[1:07:03] demons
[1:07:07] he said just like the right and the left
[1:07:09] foot of the image that Daniel saw how
[1:07:11] they wouldn't agree and mix with one
[1:07:13] another the word Eisenhower during that
[1:07:16] time Eisenhower it means iron Chris gev
[1:07:20] means clay and he pulled off his shoe
[1:07:23] and he beat it on the desk with the
[1:07:26] League of Nations Chris Kristoff did
[1:07:28] dusting dusting off oh my the hour that
[1:07:33] we're living the church and its
[1:07:36] condition so now brother Branham takes
[1:07:39] this very same vision this dream that
[1:07:43] Nebuchadnezzar has and he brings it down
[1:07:45] into the time that we are living right
[1:07:48] now
[1:07:50] I believe the date was 19 and 60 or
[1:07:53] something like that when it happened
[1:07:55] and here is these two men
[1:07:58] the eastern and the western side and the
[1:08:01] Bible said that they would never mix
[1:08:04] they would never come together they
[1:08:06] would never agree
[1:08:07] and here he was he took off his shoe and
[1:08:10] he beat it on the desk
[1:08:12] let me ask you a question why did he not
[1:08:14] beat his hands on the desk
[1:08:17] why did he not beat his head on the desk
[1:08:19] why did he not beat something else on
[1:08:22] the desk because that wasn't where we
[1:08:24] were in the time of Prophecy it wasn't
[1:08:28] where we were in the timeline of God to
[1:08:31] fulfill his word but we weren't in the
[1:08:33] head we were at the feet
[1:08:35] and so he takes off his shoe a
[1:08:38] representation of the feet of the that
[1:08:41] that consumes our feet and our toes
[1:08:43] within it and he beats it upon the desk
[1:08:46] nobody else was talking about this but
[1:08:48] brother Branham picked it up and he says
[1:08:50] oh my where are we at we are at the end
[1:08:55] time because what happens whenever we're
[1:08:58] done with defeat this rock that is June
[1:09:01] out of the mountain without hands it
[1:09:03] smashes the image
[1:09:07] so it takes the prophet of God now
[1:09:10] to take a modern event and to say this
[1:09:13] is that
[1:09:15] where are we at in the timeline of God
[1:09:21] Jezebel religion 1961.
[1:09:24] this is a pretty lengthy quote and you
[1:09:26] people for politics because you're just
[1:09:29] a good Democrat voted for something like
[1:09:32] that and soldier birthrights of
[1:09:34] americanism and Christianity to give it
[1:09:38] over to the prostitute that run Us in
[1:09:41] this nation what made us what we was see
[1:09:44] how she's been creeping in
[1:09:47] what's he talking about the Roman
[1:09:49] Catholic Church
[1:09:51] real easy until now
[1:09:55] really see how she's been creeping in
[1:09:57] real easy until now she's on the throne
[1:10:00] sure the White House Throne watch did
[1:10:04] you see the other day about the Catholic
[1:10:06] schools and Protestant schools support
[1:10:08] the Catholic school but not the
[1:10:10] protestancy oh brother you watch for a
[1:10:14] wave of stuff coming forth now notice as
[1:10:17] they did it look what taken place all
[1:10:19] this sin heaping in
[1:10:22] got to a place and got the nation in
[1:10:25] that kind of a staggering place a few
[1:10:28] years ago the Pentecostals first broke
[1:10:31] out and saved the nation a few years ago
[1:10:34] when Al Smith was going to run does
[1:10:37] anybody know who he's talking about he's
[1:10:40] talking about Alfred Smith
[1:10:43] I think it was the
[1:10:45] 1928 or the 1930 election he was the
[1:10:49] going to be the first
[1:10:52] Catholic President of the United States
[1:10:56] now watch brother Branham he's talking
[1:10:58] about this so it must be a really big
[1:11:01] deal
[1:11:04] he says but
[1:11:06] Al Smith Alfred Smith was going to run
[1:11:09] American no better then but penny cost
[1:11:13] God so worldly and went right on in and
[1:11:16] sold their rights as a Christian to
[1:11:18] politics and its politics ahead of the
[1:11:22] Bible does any I looked it up today
[1:11:25] that's how I know Alfred uh Smith or
[1:11:29] whatever his name was yeah Alfred Smith
[1:11:31] the reason he did not win the presidency
[1:11:34] that year is because all the Christian
[1:11:37] churches the Pentecostals and and all
[1:11:39] the different ones they all voted in the
[1:11:42] opposite direction for the other party
[1:11:44] why because they knew better
[1:11:48] they knew that with the Catholic
[1:11:50] President there would come Catholic
[1:11:53] ideology and there's a spirit that comes
[1:11:56] behind that whole movement
[1:12:00] because remember we're talking about
[1:12:03] spirits
[1:12:07] you may not know it or not but you were
[1:12:11] influenced and manipulated on a daily
[1:12:13] basis
[1:12:15] by evil spirits
[1:12:16] to make you do say and think things that
[1:12:19] you do not want to do think or say
[1:12:21] God help us
[1:12:23] Lord help us to keep our minds fresh to
[1:12:27] keep our minds on your word Lord to keep
[1:12:29] our minds pure
[1:12:33] he said to Pentecostals first broke out
[1:12:35] and saved the nation a few years ago
[1:12:38] but Pentecost got so worldly it went
[1:12:42] right on it went right on in and sold
[1:12:45] their rights as a Christian to politics
[1:12:48] and it's politics ahead of the Bible oh
[1:12:50] my now just a minute and watch just how
[1:12:53] this comes out now we find out what they
[1:12:56] did and the things they did we see it
[1:12:58] parallel paralleling here just exactly
[1:13:02] sin on every hand Jezebel come in she
[1:13:05] Bewitched all the people and noticed
[1:13:07] finally she began to build big shrines
[1:13:10] to bail him is that right and the balen
[1:13:13] priests flocked from everywhere to get
[1:13:15] into that place and begin to contaminate
[1:13:17] the lands with Balaam worship so now
[1:13:21] he's taken an Old Testament type and
[1:13:24] he's bringing it into the hour in which
[1:13:26] they were living in
[1:13:29] look how they've done look how they've
[1:13:31] weeded in just the things they've done
[1:13:34] look where they're at today look at
[1:13:36] Catholicism swallowing up swallowing up
[1:13:39] swallowing up
[1:13:40] marrying into breaking this just exactly
[1:13:43] what Daniel said they'd do iron and Clay
[1:13:46] wouldn't mix but mingling their seeds
[1:13:48] one with another breaking every
[1:13:50] Protestant girl marries a Catholic boy
[1:13:52] has to raise her children Catholic all
[1:13:55] like that marrying intermingling like
[1:13:58] that until it's come to a place to the
[1:14:01] whole United States is all warmed over
[1:14:05] what's it warmed over with it's wormed
[1:14:08] over with worldlyism and is wormed over
[1:14:11] with Catholicism
[1:14:15] what are we going to do as missionaries
[1:14:17] going out younger deliberate in South
[1:14:20] America and all over the part of the
[1:14:21] world Tommy Osborne and them trying to
[1:14:23] get the people out of the that paganism
[1:14:25] and they can point their finger right
[1:14:27] back that we elected our leader in the
[1:14:29] same thing what's going to happen to
[1:14:32] this world it should shake every person
[1:14:34] in here how we going to answer what's
[1:14:37] the missionary going to say you come
[1:14:39] here to liberate us from this and your
[1:14:41] own people put the same thing in your
[1:14:43] office there on the throne
[1:14:45] look back in the pages of History turn
[1:14:47] back and see if it's absolutely almost
[1:14:51] unconstitutional for it to be
[1:14:55] they wouldn't do it years ago but see
[1:14:57] we've sold out our Christian rights to
[1:14:59] politics and that's how the devil
[1:15:02] weaving his self in
[1:15:05] Ahab was nothing but a figurehead for
[1:15:08] Jezebel that's all this will be just a
[1:15:10] figurehead he won't do it himself but
[1:15:12] that system behind him will drive him to
[1:15:15] it exactly right pinch your conscience
[1:15:17] you Christian wake yourself up it's
[1:15:20] later than you think the condition that
[1:15:23] we are in condition that they were in
[1:15:25] and how they let themselves get loose
[1:15:31] my
[1:15:33] so what was it he's not talking now all
[1:15:36] of you know where I'm going with this at
[1:15:38] that time he was talking about J.F
[1:15:40] Kennedy and how the people had elected
[1:15:43] him into office and how he was the very
[1:15:46] first Roman Catholic to be the president
[1:15:48] of the United States he says it was
[1:15:51] almost
[1:15:52] unconstitutional to do it at one point
[1:15:57] now what is the problem with it that's
[1:15:59] the question
[1:16:01] what is the problem with well isn't he a
[1:16:03] person of Faith isn't uh Catholicism
[1:16:06] just a another type of Christianity
[1:16:09] Catholicism and Christianity are two
[1:16:13] Polar Opposites into the Spectrum
[1:16:16] because Catholicism is filled with
[1:16:20] idolatry
[1:16:21] it is filled with the spirit of paganism
[1:16:25] worshiping false gods
[1:16:28] friend of dead people
[1:16:29] all these different things now the
[1:16:32] people are not bad in themselves
[1:16:35] but brother brother Branham said it's
[1:16:38] the system
[1:16:40] that's driving the person
[1:16:42] it's the spirit remember brother Branham
[1:16:44] said it was Jezebel behind Ahab
[1:16:48] Ahab wasn't a bad man so brother Branham
[1:16:51] but it was the system that was behind
[1:16:54] him that was pushing these things before
[1:16:57] the people
[1:16:59] so now they elect because of the vote of
[1:17:02] the woman
[1:17:05] now they elect the wrong president
[1:17:08] now they elect a man that has a system
[1:17:12] and a spirit that has an agenda and that
[1:17:16] is pushing something forward before the
[1:17:19] people
[1:17:23] the restoration of the Bride tree
[1:17:26] I'm sorry for all the quotes I I forgot
[1:17:29] that we don't have the the things up
[1:17:32] here
[1:17:32] and so I realize it's harder to follow
[1:17:35] when we can't read it so I'm just going
[1:17:37] a little slower
[1:17:39] which is probably making it worse
[1:17:44] if I could only preach like brother
[1:17:45] Andrew Glover
[1:17:48] you guys would all be awake right now
[1:17:52] notices Stay With Me
[1:17:54] the restoration of the Bride tree 1962.
[1:17:57] there is a iron curtain there is a
[1:18:00] bamboo curtain there is a purple curtain
[1:18:02] brother you don't fear none of the rest
[1:18:04] of them but watch that purple curtain
[1:18:06] she is sitting right here on the throne
[1:18:08] today in this country remember just like
[1:18:11] Ahab did and Jezebel behind him the
[1:18:14] Bible calls the Catholic Church Jezebel
[1:18:17] prostitute and Ahab wasn't no bad guy I
[1:18:21] don't say that Mr Kennedy isn't a nice
[1:18:23] man I don't know nothing about him he's
[1:18:25] a man that's all I know he's the
[1:18:27] president I believe he'll make a good
[1:18:29] president it's not him it's that system
[1:18:32] behind him what is the system it is
[1:18:36] Jezebel prostitute system
[1:18:40] that's behind him with an agenda that's
[1:18:43] going to push things out upon the
[1:18:45] American public
[1:18:50] he said it's not him it's the system
[1:18:53] watch this wait till she gets wormed
[1:18:56] into the cabinet
[1:18:58] and everywhere she can then watch what
[1:19:00] will happen look what it done in other
[1:19:03] nations look what it's always done
[1:19:07] so now brother Branham takes it a step
[1:19:09] further he says wait until she what's he
[1:19:12] talking about the system the spirit of
[1:19:16] idolatry of paganism the spirit of
[1:19:18] Jezebel wait until she now gets wormed
[1:19:22] into the cabinet
[1:19:24] well what's the big deal about the
[1:19:26] cabinet
[1:19:29] these things was a flashing red light
[1:19:32] for brother Branham in his time
[1:19:35] to see that
[1:19:37] a Catholic President now was running the
[1:19:40] country and his flashing red lights were
[1:19:42] going off and now he's seeing the types
[1:19:44] in the Old Testament of Jezebel and of
[1:19:47] Ahab and now he's seeing this man with
[1:19:49] this religious uh religious system
[1:19:53] behind him now that's gonna because
[1:19:55] remember I already said we are
[1:19:57] influenced by spirits
[1:20:00] we're either influenced by an Unholy
[1:20:03] Spirit or we're influenced by God's holy
[1:20:07] spirit now a man without the baptism of
[1:20:10] the Holy Ghost how can he yield himself
[1:20:13] to God's holy spirit
[1:20:15] in order to make a right decision in his
[1:20:18] life for the country for his family
[1:20:19] whoever it may be
[1:20:22] so if we're not yielding to God's spirit
[1:20:25] we're yielding to something else
[1:20:27] and it's anointing us and it's causing
[1:20:30] us to make decisions it's causing us to
[1:20:32] do things it's causing us to say things
[1:20:34] and go places which we shouldn't be
[1:20:36] doing as believers
[1:20:41] it was a fresh flashing red light when
[1:20:43] brother Branham saw the vision in 1933
[1:20:46] how that a woman would rule the United
[1:20:48] States he said it would probably be the
[1:20:51] Catholic Church
[1:20:53] it's not that the people within the
[1:20:55] church are bad always remember it's the
[1:20:59] system and the spirit that's behind and
[1:21:02] driving the people and the church
[1:21:09] we realize that the spirit that's behind
[1:21:12] this certain religion it is Antichrist
[1:21:17] it is anti-god
[1:21:19] it is anti-word
[1:21:21] and the fruits that it brings forth is
[1:21:24] going to be everything that's anti to
[1:21:26] this word of God
[1:21:29] so now we're beginning to realize that
[1:21:32] the people that are in office the people
[1:21:36] that are in the Senate not only in our
[1:21:39] country but every country around the
[1:21:41] world it is extremely important because
[1:21:44] there's something that's behind him
[1:21:46] that's driving them to do what they do
[1:21:49] and why they do it
[1:21:55] within this system is dwelling the place
[1:21:58] of every foul and unclean bird
[1:22:00] with her feet of iron she is trodden
[1:22:03] across the Earth and has given to the
[1:22:05] kings of the earth to drink of the cup
[1:22:07] of her fornication
[1:22:09] my goodness
[1:22:11] we realize that President Joe Biden
[1:22:15] is the second President of the United
[1:22:18] States of the Catholic faith outside of
[1:22:21] J F Kennedy we have President Joe Biden
[1:22:26] and in his Senate now because brother
[1:22:28] Branham said watch when she worms
[1:22:31] herself into the Senate so I did a quick
[1:22:34] Google search
[1:22:36] how many of the Senate
[1:22:39] you know are Catholics within the United
[1:22:42] States
[1:22:43] 27 out of 100 people
[1:22:47] in the in the senate or in the Senate of
[1:22:50] President Biden are of the Catholic
[1:22:53] faith
[1:22:54] meaning this they are of the same mind
[1:22:58] they're of the same faith
[1:23:00] they have the same agendas
[1:23:02] they have the same system and spirit
[1:23:05] that's behind them that is pushing them
[1:23:08] towards something to make decisions on
[1:23:11] things not based upon God's word
[1:23:15] but based upon the spirit that's driving
[1:23:18] them to do it which is Jezebel
[1:23:21] prostitute anti-wort Antichrist call it
[1:23:23] whatever you want
[1:23:25] so now we can begin to see we think well
[1:23:28] why in the world is why why is our our
[1:23:31] country uh going through what it's going
[1:23:34] through it's because of the people in
[1:23:36] the office and the decisions that
[1:23:38] they're making based upon the influence
[1:23:40] of the spirit that's driving them
[1:23:47] now I looked this up and I got this from
[1:23:49] the White House web page
[1:23:52] the cabinet and independent federal
[1:23:54] agencies because I wondered
[1:23:57] well what's so big about the Senate
[1:24:00] what does the Senate do anyways
[1:24:03] do you know miles
[1:24:04] yeah I wasn't sure myself
[1:24:08] so I had to look it up
[1:24:10] what's so important about the Senate
[1:24:12] doesn't the president make all the
[1:24:15] decisions in the United States
[1:24:18] let's see what they say
[1:24:20] the cabinet and independent federal
[1:24:22] agencies are responsible for the
[1:24:26] day-to-day enforcement and
[1:24:28] administration of federal laws
[1:24:33] these departments and agencies have
[1:24:35] missions and responsibilities as widely
[1:24:38] Divergent as those of the Department of
[1:24:40] Defense the Environmental Protection
[1:24:43] Agency the Social Security
[1:24:45] Administration and the Securities and
[1:24:48] Exchange Commission
[1:24:52] is it any Wonder
[1:24:54] why we're in a place of where we are
[1:24:57] right now
[1:24:58] because the people that make the laws
[1:25:01] the people that bring these things to
[1:25:03] pass they are anointed of a certain
[1:25:06] spirit
[1:25:07] they are anointed of a certain anointing
[1:25:12] and it's something that is completely
[1:25:14] anti-word
[1:25:16] anti-god
[1:25:18] Antichrist
[1:25:20] and the longer the time goes on guess
[1:25:22] what there's going to be more laws that
[1:25:24] are passed
[1:25:26] there's going to be laws passed someday
[1:25:28] that if you're not a part of this
[1:25:30] ecumenical move
[1:25:33] we're going to close your doors
[1:25:36] we already seen it how easy it is
[1:25:39] for the whole entire world to shut down
[1:25:42] by the decisions of the leaders within
[1:25:44] that country
[1:25:46] who would have thought it not just one
[1:25:49] little country here and there not just
[1:25:52] one little state within the U.S no it
[1:25:55] was a worldwide phenomena
[1:25:58] where people were forced to stay in
[1:26:00] their houses
[1:26:02] people were forced not to go outside
[1:26:04] people were forced to get
[1:26:07] a job
[1:26:08] people were forced to do these things
[1:26:20] we realized that
[1:26:23] this system now that
[1:26:27] brother Branham said is on the throne of
[1:26:29] the United States
[1:26:31] we realize that she's running the
[1:26:34] country
[1:26:35] he said what's she going to do next
[1:26:39] what's going to happen
[1:26:40] we're going to take a loan we're going
[1:26:43] to pay off all our debts and he said
[1:26:45] when we take our loan from the church
[1:26:46] we're going to sell out our birth rates
[1:26:53] where are we at
[1:26:54] in the timeline of God
[1:26:58] you see this man taking off his shoe and
[1:27:00] beating it on the desk
[1:27:02] you see these different things we see
[1:27:04] the world is falling apart all around us
[1:27:08] we see that as Believers and Christians
[1:27:11] we have absolutely almost zero rights
[1:27:16] to speak our minds
[1:27:19] we have zero rights to say well I'm a
[1:27:22] Christian and I don't believe in this
[1:27:24] way of living
[1:27:26] I don't believe that two men should be
[1:27:28] together I don't believe in this
[1:27:30] transgender movement I don't believe in
[1:27:32] these different things and because of
[1:27:34] your beliefs they'll call you a
[1:27:36] homophobe
[1:27:38] they'll call you evil
[1:27:41] they'll call you all kinds of of of bad
[1:27:44] things and they'll try to put you in
[1:27:46] jail
[1:27:47] try to make a big deal out of you
[1:27:49] why because you're not going along with
[1:27:53] their agenda
[1:27:56] but yet it's okay for everybody else to
[1:27:58] speak their minds
[1:28:01] it says worldwide my mom text me the
[1:28:04] other day and she said
[1:28:07] they had a gay rights parade in Belfast
[1:28:10] or whatever uh about a week or two ago
[1:28:13] and
[1:28:15] I think the first half of their little
[1:28:17] quotation it was It was kind of profane
[1:28:21] and I can't remember it so that's a good
[1:28:22] thing
[1:28:23] but the second part was we're coming for
[1:28:27] your kids
[1:28:30] something something we're coming for
[1:28:32] your kids
[1:28:34] something something we're coming for
[1:28:36] your kids
[1:28:38] why isn't somebody telling them hey
[1:28:41] who's coming human traffickers are going
[1:28:43] to come from my kids what are they
[1:28:44] talking about no nothing has ever said
[1:28:47] you know why they want to come for our
[1:28:49] kids
[1:28:50] because they can't have kids of Their
[1:28:51] Own
[1:28:55] now look at the importance
[1:28:57] of where we're at
[1:28:59] in this present day
[1:29:02] look at the importance that we have
[1:29:05] as families as heads of the homes
[1:29:09] as fathers over our children as mothers
[1:29:12] over our children
[1:29:14] look at the responsibility that we have
[1:29:16] to teach our kids truth
[1:29:21] to tell them what's right according to
[1:29:23] God's word to tell them what's wrong
[1:29:26] according to God's word not according to
[1:29:29] what the system that's running the
[1:29:31] country says
[1:29:35] Hallelujah
[1:29:39] this system
[1:29:41] is nicolaitanism to the core as the
[1:29:44] musicians come we'll bring this to a
[1:29:46] close
[1:29:48] and it wants to divide and conquer the
[1:29:51] true worshipers of our privilege of how
[1:29:53] we worship God
[1:29:54] in spirit and in truth and it's being
[1:29:58] done by passing these laws amongst us
[1:30:04] well it's the law it's got to be true
[1:30:07] ha
[1:30:09] not if it's not according to God's word
[1:30:13] we are very quickly as Believers going
[1:30:16] to a place
[1:30:18] that we no longer have free speech
[1:30:23] we are told that we have free speech
[1:30:27] but when we use our speech freely and
[1:30:29] speak on the things of the conditions of
[1:30:32] the convictions that's on Upon Us Upon
[1:30:34] Our Hearts guess what's happening
[1:30:36] they're rising up against it
[1:30:39] calling us evil
[1:30:41] calling us Warlords whatever it may be
[1:30:43] you're just full of hatred against
[1:30:45] you're a Christian you're supposed to
[1:30:47] have love towards God's creatures
[1:30:52] well love is corrective
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:59] brother Branham said in one of the
[1:31:01] quotes that I read he said that this is
[1:31:04] not a Time
[1:31:08] to let loose
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:12] Pentecostals they got worldly
[1:31:15] they let loose
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:18] they started taking
[1:31:20] speaking in tongues is the initial
[1:31:21] evidence they started getting all riled
[1:31:24] up they started getting all loose in
[1:31:26] their worship
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:30] started getting all loose in their lives
[1:31:33] toward the only thing that It produced
[1:31:35] was an imitation
[1:31:39] the only thing that it was producing was
[1:31:41] a hypocritical Christian
[1:31:44] and now we can see it
[1:31:47] creeping in and if we're not careful
[1:31:49] it'll creep into our lives
[1:31:52] and it'll creep in to our churches
[1:31:58] people are getting too loose with their
[1:32:00] life
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:02] we'll just loosen up man
[1:32:06] now a person within the message somebody
[1:32:09] who wants to hold a standard
[1:32:11] somebody who says it's time to kick the
[1:32:15] TV out it's time to sanctify the home
[1:32:17] it's time to get off your cell phone
[1:32:19] it's time to get off YouTubers it's time
[1:32:22] to do these things why because there's a
[1:32:24] looseness within the church
[1:32:28] and the ones who want to stand and have
[1:32:31] a conviction in their lives guess what
[1:32:34] they're being seen as as legalists
[1:32:39] well you're just a legalist
[1:32:42] you need to loosen up a little bit
[1:32:44] you're a little uptight
[1:32:46] [Music]
[1:32:48] brother Branham said it's not a time to
[1:32:51] let loose
[1:32:52] but it's a time for us as Believers to
[1:32:54] tighten our belts
[1:32:57] it's a time for us as Believers to
[1:32:59] re-sanctify our homes
[1:33:01] it's a time for us as Believers to get
[1:33:04] back to
[1:33:06] get back to our first love
[1:33:10] a life of sanctification a life filled
[1:33:14] with Holy Ghost and with overcoming
[1:33:17] power
[1:33:22] well if you just soften up a little bit
[1:33:24] if you just loosen up a little bit if
[1:33:27] you just if you just let loose and relax
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:33] yeah let loose and relax a little bit
[1:33:36] see what happens
[1:33:37] coming for our children
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:42] and when I heard that
[1:33:49] you gotta fight in your hands
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:33:57] ain't gonna take none of my kids
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:00] ain't gonna preach some kind of Filth to
[1:34:03] my kids in schools and these different
[1:34:05] things and think I'm just going to stand
[1:34:06] by and let you do it
[1:34:09] you think you're gonna come and take
[1:34:10] something away from me that God gave me
[1:34:13] good luck
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:19] it's time for us to tighten up
[1:34:22] it's time for us to tighten our belts
[1:34:23] it's time for us to let loose of the
[1:34:26] things of the world
[1:34:28] these things that that get in our way of
[1:34:32] of having a closer walk with God I
[1:34:36] I feel burdened in my heart right now
[1:34:40] and I'm thinking there's there's too
[1:34:42] many of you are living a loose life
[1:34:48] letting things into the home that
[1:34:49] shouldn't be there
[1:34:53] Stephen do you ever let your kids watch
[1:34:56] yeah that's sure I do
[1:34:59] but it's not every night it's not every
[1:35:01] day
[1:35:03] but you know what it's time to knock it
[1:35:04] back a little bit
[1:35:06] [Music]
[1:35:12] why they want you to let loose
[1:35:15] because if you just let loose
[1:35:18] just drop the standard
[1:35:19] well everybody else is doing it how
[1:35:22] about you be a standard Bearer
[1:35:27] how about you stand upon the word of God
[1:35:28] on your own convictions
[1:35:31] how about not using somebody else as
[1:35:33] your absolute
[1:35:36] somebody else is your standard Bearer
[1:35:39] but get on your knees and see God
[1:35:42] and say father
[1:35:43] what is my convictions for my family and
[1:35:47] my household no matter what anybody else
[1:35:50] is doing
[1:35:53] chances are
[1:35:55] if you are letting loose in your
[1:36:00] your softening up in your walk and your
[1:36:03] convictions
[1:36:04] chances are when the squeeze comes
[1:36:08] chances are when there's a little bit of
[1:36:10] pressure put on you you'll fold like a
[1:36:12] squares can
[1:36:16] God doesn't want no compromisers
[1:36:21] God doesn't want a bunch of people that
[1:36:23] says yeah I believe the message but
[1:36:26] yeah it's a little bit hard to do that
[1:36:28] so don't you realize the hour in which
[1:36:31] we're living yeah I do
[1:36:36] be compromise now
[1:36:38] chances are you'll be a compromiser when
[1:36:40] the Lord comes
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:44] if you compromise in the little things
[1:36:48] guess what you'll compromise and big
[1:36:51] things
[1:36:54] let's bow our heads together
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:00] father
[1:37:03] we see the time where we're at in the
[1:37:06] great timepiece of God
[1:37:10] and Lord we know without a shadow of a
[1:37:12] doubt
[1:37:14] we're there
[1:37:16] we're at the End Time Lord
[1:37:21] and it's a great and it's a dreadful day
[1:37:25] for the Bride of Jesus Christ who you
[1:37:28] are
[1:37:29] have a desire to hold a standard within
[1:37:32] their lives within their homes within
[1:37:34] their families
[1:37:35] we know Lord that it's going to be a
[1:37:37] great day
[1:37:39] but to the compromisers to the ones Lord
[1:37:42] that are letting loose
[1:37:45] father is going to be a dreadful
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:50] thing Lord we feel the pressure
[1:37:55] Lord not only do we see the darkness
[1:38:00] but we feel the darkness
[1:38:03] not only do we feel the darkness Lord
[1:38:06] but it's
[1:38:07] all around us and it's smothering us
[1:38:13] I pray that you would shine light
[1:38:15] in our hearts and in our lives
[1:38:19] perhaps father there's those amongst us
[1:38:22] that
[1:38:24] have let down the standard
[1:38:27] they've gotten a little loose
[1:38:31] Lord they've been yielding to the wrong
[1:38:34] things
[1:38:37] they have been given themselves to the
[1:38:39] things in the peoples of the world
[1:38:41] chasing after money women in popularity
[1:38:46] Lord I ask for a Special Touch in their
[1:38:49] lives
[1:38:51] and if you have to Lord I pray that you
[1:38:54] would take them through the school of
[1:38:56] humility
[1:38:58] because our desired Lord is this
[1:39:01] that not one is Left Behind
[1:39:06] Lord we're not here as Believers to be
[1:39:09] left behind
[1:39:11] but we're here on a Wednesday night
[1:39:14] because Lord when you come we want to go
[1:39:18] and so I'm asking now by
[1:39:22] your Holy Spirit Lord that you would
[1:39:25] Quicken the hearts and as you Quicken
[1:39:28] Hearts father I pray as
[1:39:31] when they would go home Lord and realize
[1:39:33] that things are a little loose that
[1:39:36] it would go beyond
[1:39:39] the Intercourse of the Mind
[1:39:43] and that it would go down into the heart
[1:39:45] of every believer
[1:39:47] and that it would cause an action
[1:39:51] May there be a reaction to the action of
[1:39:54] the word tonight Lord
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:39:56] and may that reaction father bring forth
[1:39:59] fruit
[1:40:00] some 60 some 90 some 100-fold father
[1:40:06] that thy name may be glorified amongst
[1:40:09] us here father we love you so much
[1:40:14] we thank you for your word
[1:40:17] and Lord we are honored to be living in
[1:40:20] such a time as this bless your people
[1:40:24] take us home safely
[1:40:26] bring us back on Sunday Lord with
[1:40:29] an anticipation Lord
[1:40:32] father for greater things
[1:40:35] thank you now in the name of Jesus
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:43] Jesus Christ what a time we're living in
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:47] what a day it is
[1:40:49] it's a great day
[1:40:52] but it's also a dreadful day
[1:40:56] it is a great day to those who are
[1:40:58] watching and waiting for us coming
[1:41:01] it is a great day to those who
[1:41:04] are trying their best to live for
[1:41:06] standard for Jesus Christ but it's a
[1:41:09] dreadful day to those who think they're
[1:41:12] right
[1:41:15] but yet because of their inconsistency
[1:41:19] because of their looseness and slackness
[1:41:22] in their lives
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:28] I trust this evening
[1:41:31] very sobering thought
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:42] we all think we're doing okay
[1:41:46] but there's certain areas in our lives
[1:41:48] guess what
[1:41:49] time to give it over
[1:41:51] it's time to give it to God
[1:41:53] [Music]
[1:41:54] I'm to let go of it
[1:41:56] it's time to release it
[1:41:58] because time is too short to waste time
[1:42:02] on silly things
[1:42:04] my brother my sister
[1:42:07] let me just speak to your hearts
[1:42:11] I say don't waste no more time
[1:42:13] [Music]
[1:42:17] if you're not ready there's still time
[1:42:19] to get ready
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:22] he hasn't come yet but yet he's coming
[1:42:27] and so it's time for us as individuals
[1:42:30] to take inventory of Our Lives
[1:42:35] what do I need and what do I not need
[1:42:40] what's good about me
[1:42:42] and what's not good about me
[1:42:45] who cares what's good
[1:42:48] I want to work on those things which are
[1:42:51] not good
[1:42:52] and it's a hard thing to do is to take
[1:42:54] self-inventory of yourself
[1:42:58] and to be honest with yourself
[1:43:00] and write it down
[1:43:03] have you ever done that
[1:43:06] have you ever taken a synopsis of
[1:43:09] yourself and the things that that you
[1:43:12] know are not right according to God's
[1:43:13] word and you write those things down
[1:43:15] [Music]
[1:43:21] throw up
[1:43:23] because you know that it is not
[1:43:25] according to God's word I guarantee you
[1:43:27] if you do it it'll have an effect in
[1:43:29] your life
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:31] and if you read it and you say my
[1:43:34] well
[1:43:36] I sure don't want to do that anymore
[1:43:39] I sure don't want to act like that
[1:43:41] anymore God these are the areas that I'm
[1:43:44] struggling with
[1:43:45] Now by your Holy Spirit come and take
[1:43:49] control amen let's Stand Together
[1:43:54] [Music]
