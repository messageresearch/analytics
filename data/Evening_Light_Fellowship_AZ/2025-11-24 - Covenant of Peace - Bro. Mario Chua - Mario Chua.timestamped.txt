[10:32] Amen. Amen. Brother Neil, it's okay to
[10:34] read your testimony this morning.
[10:36] [music] Amen. God bless you this
[10:37] morning. Amen. Brother Neil left a a
[10:40] note on the update on the desk this
[10:42] morning. Brother Neil says, "Test
[10:45] results update. I'd like to give praise,
[10:48] honor, and glory to our Lord Jesus. He
[10:50] never ceases to show his mighty hand
[10:52] through these tr troublesome trials and
[10:54] times that we've had in our lives. Every
[10:57] time I go to the doctor, whether it's
[10:58] for a followup or a test, his miracles
[11:01] shine so bright that the doctors have to
[11:03] say, "This man is a miracle." And we
[11:06] believe that this morning. [snorts]
[11:07] Amen.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; The update on his aorta image review.
[11:11] After the vascular doctor read his
[11:14] results, showed the images of the aorta,
[11:17] he asked brother Neil, "When did you
[11:19] have another aortic dissection?"
[11:23] Much to sister Karen and my surprise, we
[11:26] looked at the doctor and said, "What
[11:27] other dissection?"
[11:30] He should proceeded to show us a picture
[11:33] another dissection in the lower region
[11:36] of the aorta. This second dissection
[11:38] will be closely reviewed also and
[11:41] updates are forthcoming. The vascular
[11:43] doctor's attention is on the type A dert
[11:46] section uh at hand showing currently
[11:50] showing a 5.2 2 cm in dilation and I
[11:53] have two options of [snorts] surgery. Uh
[11:56] two options for surgery were post
[11:58] proposed. Uh option one open heart open
[12:03] chest repair the valves uh open the
[12:05] chest repair the valves to direct flow
[12:08] back to the true luminum correct path
[12:10] for the aorta. Option B would be will
[12:13] consist of three surgeries but can leave
[12:15] him paralyzed or with other serious
[12:18] outcomes. After discussing this [music]
[12:20] with sister Karen, they have chosen
[12:22] option A. [snorts]
[12:24] The test results will now have to be
[12:26] handed over to a team of cardia cardio
[12:30] surgeons to determine the complexity and
[12:32] how to perform the needed repairs.
[12:35] Waiting for the completion of the
[12:36] review. Two procedures that need my
[12:39] immediate attention.
[12:41] Carterid artery ultrasound to help find
[12:44] out why his right arm is going
[12:47] completely numb. This will happen on
[12:49] December the 5th. Second procedure is an
[12:52] angiogram to repair blood flow to the
[12:54] one kidney that is only half working and
[12:56] that'll be a week later on December the
[12:59] 12th. I want to thank you, brother Ron,
[13:02] all the brothers and sisters in Christ,
[13:05] all your prayers, your support through
[13:07] this. The Lord will always be in control
[13:09] and I rest in that with all of my heart
[13:12] and my aort. So we thank the Lord for
[13:15] having his hand upon you, brother Neil.
[13:18] He still moves
[13:20] &gt;&gt; in the hearts of his people.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Our other needs today. [music] Sister
[13:24] Melody Weeden says, "I want to thank the
[13:26] Lord for uh finding my my brother's long
[13:29] lost baby uh he picked up for adoption
[13:34] uh in the 70s and I've been praying o
[13:36] over the [crying] years for her to be
[13:38] reunited with the family and through DNA
[13:41] test that she was she was found to be
[13:45] tied to her dad." [crying] So, we thank
[13:46] the Lord for answering this long prayer
[13:48] that Sister Melody has had. Sister
[13:51] Hannah Yarro says, "I'm requesting
[13:53] prayer for my grandmother Navaro."
[13:57] Grandmother Navaro has a dental
[14:00] procedure last week. She had one and
[14:02] she's experiencing quite a bit of
[14:03] anxiety and the slow healing process and
[14:06] she's asking prayer for everything to be
[14:09] healed. So, let's remember Hannah's
[14:10] grandmother today. Brother Rod Brander
[14:13] says, "Please remember a friend of mine.
[14:14] His name is Larry Overby.
[14:18] Larry [music] has a special unspoken
[14:20] need in his life. So let's remember this
[14:22] need for Larry overly. Sister Ramona
[14:26] Aldco says, "Please pray for my daughter
[14:28] Vanessa." Vanessa goes Monday for a
[14:31] biopsy on her right breast and her left
[14:33] lymph nodes under her arm. Then
[14:36] Wednesday and MRI on her chest. The
[14:38] doctors are checking to make sure the
[14:40] cancer has not spread and I am trusting
[14:42] in God for her healing. and the healing
[14:45] in her family. So, let's remember
[14:47] Vanessa, Sister Ramona's daughter. The
[14:49] Lord would touch her and come on the
[14:50] scene. Want to remember brother Mario.

[15:16] he has a major uh visit with the heart
[15:19] doctors. Tomorrow morning, he's going to
[15:21] have five tests done. Pray that he has
[15:23] the strength and everything to go
[15:25] through these five tests to determine
[15:26] what kind of procedure he needs for his
[15:28] heart. Our pastor needs us at this time.
[15:30] He needs our prayers. He's uh he he's
[15:33] strong in spirit and he just needs
[15:36] prayers for his body, for the direction,

[31:43] [applause]
[31:48] [applause]
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[32:20] I wanted to do a
[32:23] a little testimony before I sing.
[32:33] Sometimes as we
[32:36] walk through this life being a
[32:39] Christian, we think we're doing pretty
[32:41] good. you know, we're
[32:44] we're praying, we're reading, we're
[32:47] listening to the message,
[32:49] &gt;&gt; and you know, we think our lives are
[32:53] pretty well set in the Lord, and we're
[32:56] walking the best we can.
[32:59] That's what I was doing.
[33:02] [snorts]
[33:05] And one day I
[33:09] God showed me some
[33:12] He showed me something in my life
[33:20] that I didn't see. And I truly did not
[33:23] see it.
[33:26] It embarrassed me.
[33:28] It shocked me.
[33:32] It made me ashamed.
[33:36] I don't know if anybody's gone through
[33:38] that.
[33:41] But it's not a it's a hard thing. It's
[33:44] hard thing to
[33:47] but it's a
[33:49] it's a merciful thing too that God would
[33:52] show you
[33:53] &gt;&gt; and and that's the way I take it. It was
[33:55] a mercy that God would even show me that
[33:58] in this life
[33:59] &gt;&gt; because when you think you're doing so
[34:01] good
[34:02] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden you see something
[34:05] &gt;&gt; it's not good.
[34:07] Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; And through this,
[34:11] you know, the person that it was
[34:13] hurting,
[34:16] I had to repent to them first
[34:19] before I could repent to God.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; And you know, this this has been
[34:29] happening for a long time. And you know,
[34:32] and this past week, things have been
[34:34] happening. And I got to a point where
[34:39] I felt like I was being crushed.
[34:42] And then I felt like the crushing became
[34:45] grinding.
[34:47] And that's the song I'm going to sing.
[34:51] See, when God unfolds the rosie, I know
[34:54] I just sung this one a few weeks back,
[34:58] &gt;&gt; but every time God when God was showing
[35:01] me this, that song keep coming.
[35:04] And the words in this song became so
[35:07] real
[35:09] &gt;&gt; because that's what I felt
[35:11] &gt;&gt; everything.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; And before all this happened,
[35:16] I read an article.
[35:19] This pastor had asked this old farmer to
[35:23] pray over the food.
[35:26] And this farmer starts out.
[35:30] He says, "Lord, I really hate
[35:32] buttermilk."
[35:34] You know, and he pauses a bit. He goes
[35:37] on said, "Lord, and I sure don't like
[35:40] lard, you know, and he pauses and the
[35:44] pastor kind of, you know, Opus and I
[35:47] starts looking up and kind of where this
[35:48] is going to head." And
[35:53] then he goes on and says, [music] "And
[35:55] Lord, I don't much care for raw flour
[35:58] either.
[36:00] and he pauses
[36:05] and all a sudden he says, "But Lord,
[36:07] when you mix all those ingredients
[36:09] together, it sure makes a good biscuit."
[36:13] &gt;&gt; You know, and sometimes we go through
[36:15] these trials in life
[36:17] &gt;&gt; and we get tunnel vision.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; We look at this one certain trial and we
[36:21] hate it. We don't know why we're going
[36:23] through it.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; And we go through another trial. We
[36:25] don't know what we're doing. How are we
[36:27] going to go through it?
[36:29] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden
[36:31] &gt;&gt; if we just hold on and wait, God mixes
[36:34] those ingredients together. He sends us
[36:37] through the oven
[36:38] &gt;&gt; and look what he makes.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; He makes the child of God. He makes the
[36:42] son of God. He makes the bride of
[36:44] Christ.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; That's what we are.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; So just wait. Wait and see what he
[36:50] makes. [singing]
[36:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[37:06] &gt;&gt; There have been trials.
[37:14] There have been times when I thought my
[37:16] prayers
[37:18] didn't even reach the ceiling
[37:21] of the room.
[37:24] where I now to pray.
[37:29] And a voice inside [music]
[37:31] kept asking me, "Did you think God was
[37:35] really listening
[37:37] to anything
[37:40] that I had to say?
[37:45] I kept on [singing]
[37:47] praying,
[37:49] holding on my faith,
[37:52] knowing God,
[37:54] he's always in control.
[38:00] And I waited like a rose. But in the
[38:04] garden,
[38:06] for only [singing] God
[38:09] can unfold the rose.
[38:16] When God unfolds the rose, [singing]
[38:23] he always gets it right.
[38:30] When the pedals are in place,
[38:37] oh, it's such a beautiful [singing]
[38:40] sight.
[38:45] God knows when to hold on [singing]
[38:51] and the perfect time to let go.
[38:58] So let him have his way
[39:05] and watch God unfold the rose.
[39:14] There are trials and tribulations
[39:19] we must all go through.
[39:22] When it comes to heartaches, we've all
[39:25] had our share.
[39:29] When times are the hardest, we need to
[39:33] hold on to the promise. He said he'd
[39:37] never give us more than we [singing]
[39:39] could bear.
[39:43] So I'll keep on to praying,
[39:47] holding on by faith, knowing God is
[39:52] working all things for my good.
[39:57] And I'll wait just like a rose bud in
[40:01] the garden.
[40:04] Only God
[40:06] can unfold the rose.
[40:13] When God unfolds the rose, [singing]
[40:19] he always gets it right.
[40:26] When the petals are in place.
[40:32] Oh, it's such a beautiful sight.
[40:40] He know [music and singing]
[40:42] Hold on.
[40:46] And the perfect time to let go.
[40:53] So let him have his way [singing]
[40:59] and watch God unfold the ro.
[41:06] God knows when to hold on [singing]
[41:12] and the perfect time to let go.
[41:20] So let him have his [singing] way.
[41:26] and watch God unfold the role.
[41:34] [applause and music]
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Thank you.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; The Lord is good. Can you say amen?
[41:48] Amen. Let's stand this morning as we
[41:49] change the order of the service. Brother
[41:51] Mario comes and ministers today. Sure
[41:53] appreciate brother Mario and his gift in
[41:55] his life and being sensitive to the Holy
[41:57] Spirit. May the Lord just visit each and
[42:00] every one of us today in a supernatural
[42:02] way. Be unto your name. Be unto your
[42:04] name. Be unto the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:08] Christ.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of our praise,
[42:12] &gt;&gt; worthy of our adoration. All glory and
[42:15] honor be unto him this morning. Amen.
[42:18] And let's sing this this morning as we
[42:19] get ready to change the order of the
[42:20] service. Amen. Amen. Let's sing it sing
[42:24] it to him this morning. And we are a
[42:29] woman
[42:31] and you [music] are [singing]
[42:33] forever.
[42:35] Born of the angels,
[42:39] God [music] before time,
[42:44] are [singing]
[42:45] a maker. [music]
[42:47] And you are eternal
[42:52] everlasting
[42:55] and [music] reigning on high.
[43:00] [singing]
[43:01] Holy,
[43:04] holy, [music]
[43:05] [singing] Lord God Almighty,
[43:08] worthy
[43:11] is the [music and singing] lamb who was
[43:15] slain.
[43:17] I [music]
[43:19] praise
[43:22] and glory [music]
[43:26] to
[43:28] your name.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:33] &gt;&gt; of
[43:35] your name. Second verse says, "And we
[43:39] are [music] the broken
[43:42] and you are the giver.
[43:46] Jesus
[43:48] redeemer, you are my [music and singing]
[43:50] king to sing.
[43:54] You are the love song
[43:57] we'll sing [music]
[43:59] forever.
[44:01] bow me before you and blessed is your
[44:06] name [music] everyone. [singing]
[44:11] [music]
[44:12] I bless you this morning.
[44:18] He is [singing]
[44:19] the [music] lamb who was slain.
[44:23] the highest [singing]
[44:25] praise and honor and glory
[44:32] to your name.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music]
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; God bless everyone.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[44:49] this morning. Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Just like what uh King David said, they
[44:54] were so glad when they said unto me,
[44:57] "Let us go into the house of the Lord."
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; We had so many things to thank the Lord.
[45:02] Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Not only we receive his messenger in
[45:06] these last days,
[45:08] &gt;&gt; but we heard his voice in these last
[45:10] days.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Because in the days of the voice of the
[45:13] seventh angel, we will begin to sound
[45:15] the mystery of God revealed. So it was
[45:18] not the voice of the prophet but it was
[45:20] the voice of God speaking to each and
[45:22] every one of us.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; So we need to to rejoice
[45:27] &gt;&gt; because in this age alone God came down
[45:30] and revealed himself to each and every
[45:31] one of us.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; So it is an individual revelation of
[45:35] himself to each and every one of us.
[45:37] It's not by group.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Even the scripture said when the son of
[45:42] man came shall he find faith. Yes.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; He didn't come to find a church member.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't find to come a good work
[45:52] &gt;&gt; or good affiliations or whatever status
[45:55] in your you're in life.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; But when the son come shall he find
[46:01] faith.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; So we need revelations above things
[46:07] because revelations alone can
[46:09] distinguish us from the right and wrong.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are we are walking in a thin
[46:15] line but it takes the revelations of God
[46:18] because upon this rock he will build my
[46:20] church upon the revelation of his. So
[46:22] thank you musician.
[46:24] Thank you for our song special. Praise
[46:26] God.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we are now uh in the
[46:30] presence of the Lord and
[46:33] &gt;&gt; we have only one desire this morning
[46:36] &gt;&gt; and that is to worship God in spirit and
[46:38] in truth.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the most privileged people
[46:41] in these last days. That's right.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Because not many people can receive what
[46:45] you receive.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; It's only by the grace of God. Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, praise God, to be a
[46:50] Christian is not our desire, but it was
[46:52] God's desire for us to be a Christian
[46:55] &gt;&gt; because he said no one can come to him
[46:57] except the father draw him near.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we don't come here by our own
[47:01] desire, but it was God's desire for for
[47:04] us to be here. Amen. He wants to speak
[47:06] to us.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we want to speak to him also.
[47:09] Amen. This morning. Amen.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the purpose of why we
[47:14] are here. Praise God. That is to worship
[47:16] him in spirit and in truth. So, we need
[47:19] to be excited.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you're excited, I will be
[47:23] excited.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; So, I need your help. Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Because this is a two-way.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; We are not here just to listen to a
[47:31] preacher, but we are here to encourage
[47:33] the preacher.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Because I cannot preach without your
[47:36] encouragement.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Don't look at me as if you
[47:39] you have a blank in your mind. Look at
[47:42] me and say go brother.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; We need you brother.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; We need you. So we need to encourage one
[47:48] another. As always says a preacher is
[47:50] just like a waiter.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; That I cannot serve unless you order.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if God is here, we need to
[47:58] order. Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Because God knows every needs. Amen.
[48:02] What was in your mind, what is in our
[48:04] heart, God knows our needs. So we need
[48:06] to pull. Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Upon the presence of the Lord. Amen.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Because he said that he if you need
[48:12] anything, you need to ask.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; So why don't you ask because you don't
[48:18] believe.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; So if you believe that he is here,
[48:21] whatever things you ask, he will he will
[48:24] you will receive it. Then we will come
[48:26] into his
[48:28] &gt;&gt; in his presence this morning. Let us bow
[48:30] our head. Heavenly Father, we're so
[48:32] grateful, Lord, this morning for your
[48:34] presence. We just feel your presence
[48:36] this morning Lord and we are we just
[48:38] humble ourselves Lord that by your grace
[48:42] hallelujah we stand before you this
[48:44] morning Lord God with one purpose and
[48:47] that is to glorify your name Lord we
[48:49] just want to thank you for the
[48:50] revelations that you given us Lord Amen
[48:53] we don't come here to be saved Lord
[48:55] because as the messages of Leah hour
[48:57] said Lord we were saved even before the
[48:59] foundation of the word but we thank you
[49:01] for the revelation that you put in our
[49:03] heart that we realize realize that we
[49:05] are already part of you even before the
[49:06] foundation of the word Lord.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; So uh help us Lord to to walk according
[49:12] Hallelujah to the revelation that you've
[49:14] given us Lord. Hallelujah. So this
[49:16] morning we humble ourselves Lord and
[49:18] commit our our life to you. May you just
[49:21] bless and sanctify each and every one of
[49:23] us Lord that your name once again be
[49:25] glorified in Jesus Christ's name. Amen
[49:28] and amen. Hallelujah. So let's uh turn
[49:31] our Bible to the book of Isaiah chapter
[49:35] 54
[49:37] &gt;&gt; verse 7-10.
[49:43] So we'll just also remember our pastor
[49:45] brother Ron brother Neil.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; We believe that God is in control.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; But you just need to believe it.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:00] Isaiah 54:7.
[50:05] So Isaiah is the mouthpiece of God.
[50:07] Emmanuel always believe that uh the
[50:10] prophet always represent God to the
[50:12] people.
[50:15] So he said that for a small moment I
[50:17] have forsaken thee but with great mercy
[50:21] I will gather thee.
[50:23] So God say he forsook his people for a
[50:27] moment
[50:28] &gt;&gt; but he will now gather them back with
[50:30] great compassion.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; So we'll notice the nature of God in the
[50:35] contrast of small in judgment but great
[50:38] in mercies.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So in a little wrap I hid my
[50:44] face from thee for a moment
[50:47] but with everlasting kindness will I
[50:49] have mercy on thee said the Lord. thy
[50:52] redeemer.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; For this is as the waters of Noah unto
[50:58] me. For as I have sworn that the water
[51:01] of Noah should no more go over the
[51:04] earth, so I have sworn that I would not
[51:06] be wrought with thee, nor rebuke thee.
[51:09] So, so Isaiah is mentioning about Noah.
[51:12] Amen. He will no longer judge the people
[51:14] by the flood. So that covenant that God
[51:17] made with Noah is an everlasting
[51:19] covenant.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; For the mountain shall depart and the
[51:28] hills be removed.
[51:31] So this is showing a word of torm and
[51:35] cataclysmic judgment. Noah's word came
[51:38] to cataclysmic judgment and this word is
[51:40] also heading towards another Catholic
[51:43] judgment.
[51:45] And we are convinced about that. Amen.
[51:48] So there must be a people on earth now
[51:50] that God has established a covenant with
[51:52] as he had done with Noah and his group.
[51:55] For the mountain shall depart and the
[51:56] hills be removed, but my kindness shall
[51:59] not depart from thee. Neither shall the
[52:03] covenant of my peace be removed, said
[52:05] the Lord that hath mercy on thee.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; And may the Lord add a blessing upon the
[52:11] reading of his word. You may now be
[52:13] seated.
[52:15] So I will take this title from this
[52:17] verse. But my kindness shall not depart
[52:20] from thee, neither shall the covenant of
[52:23] my peace be removed, said the Lord
[52:27] that have mercy on them.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:31] So God is showing us by the scripture
[52:34] that as a believer of his word that he
[52:38] has sent in this hour by messenger
[52:40] that he has placed upon our lives a
[52:43] covenant of peace as he did with Noah
[52:46] and the people of his group that were
[52:48] under his message. The covenant of peace
[52:51] and this covenant of peace an
[52:52] everlasting covenant.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So people try to draw peace from
[52:59] different places. They're trying to find
[53:02] peace. Sometimes they they try to run
[53:05] away from the city life, go to the
[53:07] mountain
[53:10] to have peace or sometimes in
[53:12] medications or sometimes in in music.
[53:16] They want to find peace. Maybe some uh
[53:21] some retreat or somewhere an I an island
[53:24] or maybe somewhere they trying to find
[53:25] peace and some try to find through drugs
[53:30] and through some entertainment through
[53:32] groups but you cannot find peace.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; We can only find peace through the
[53:36] promises of God. Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; There's nothing
[53:40] this word cannot give us peace
[53:43] &gt;&gt; except the word of God. Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; So as sons and daughters of God, we have
[53:50] all had our rebukes and chastisements in
[53:53] life.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; When we are being born again, we are
[53:56] already sons and daughters of God. So we
[53:58] struggle in this life. We have true ups
[54:01] and downs and sometimes we have
[54:02] chastisement and sometimes we have
[54:04] rebukes
[54:05] &gt;&gt; and all of that. All of us can
[54:08] experience that because as uh Hebrew
[54:11] 12:6 for whom the Lord loveth he
[54:14] chastenth and scourge every son whom he
[54:18] received.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; So if you are sons and daughters of God
[54:21] praise expect chastisement expect some
[54:24] rebuke. Amen. Because it is the love of
[54:26] God. Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; It is not to put us down but is to
[54:30] rebuke us to correct us. Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Under tutorship. So as
[54:34] believer of his word, this hour that has
[54:36] come to us through the message, we are
[54:40] supernaturally under the power of the
[54:43] covenant of peace in this time.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We may not know it, but we are
[54:48] under the supernatural covenant of
[54:51] peace.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because that is the promise
[54:54] of God. So the promise is not if you do
[54:57] good, you have a peace. If you don't do
[55:00] good, no peace. But if there's a certain
[55:03] rebuke, but a mercy is so vast.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And his mercy never fails
[55:09] because this covenant of peace, he
[55:12] establish it as an everlasting covenant.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; So because
[55:20] the word revealed for this day directly
[55:22] connect us to the sacrifice of the blood
[55:25] that was shed at Calvary.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; This message is the voice of that blood.
[55:30] Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; That has spoken in these days. And when
[55:34] you take the truth of this hour into
[55:36] your heart by faith, then that is the
[55:38] same spirit that was released by the
[55:41] blood of Christ that is now coming back
[55:43] upon you in this day by the spirit of
[55:46] the word in the message the token
[55:50] which he preached in 1963.
[55:53] said. Now we also find in Hebrew the
[55:55] 12th chapter 24 verse that the New
[55:58] Testament the blood speaks better
[56:01] things.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; The blood is speaking. Do you believe
[56:05] it? The blood is speaking.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; And the blood's got a voice.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And the voice of the blood is the word.
[56:13] Hallelujah.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; And that's what makes it whether it's
[56:16] right or wrong that the word is
[56:18] identified by the voice of the blood.
[56:20] Amen.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; The voice of the blood is the Holy Ghost
[56:23] that brings life.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; It is life and it brings life to the
[56:27] word and quicken it.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. Hallelujah.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; So the blood still speak
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and the blood has a voice. Hallelujah.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; So token paragraph 168 sure the blood
[56:39] speak. It speaks about a thing. The old
[56:42] testament the blood spoke of guilt. In
[56:45] the new testament it speaks of
[56:47] redemption.
[56:49] In the Old Testament, it spoke of death
[56:51] and sorrow. In the New Testament, it
[56:54] speaks of resurrection and life.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; It speaks heaven.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; And the same blood that was shed upon
[57:01] the ground and called out after his
[57:03] brother death. Oh, I I I I skipped one
[57:07] of program. He said in the Old
[57:08] Testament, it spoke of death and sorrow.
[57:10] In the New Testament, it speaks of
[57:12] resurrection and life. It speaks of
[57:14] healing.
[57:16] The blood of this voice and it speaks
[57:18] healing.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; So if you are sick this morning,
[57:21] hallelujah. The blood is still in
[57:23] effect.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; The blood is still the voice and the
[57:26] blood speak healing.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Not only healing in the physical because
[57:30] when we heal in the physical, we can get
[57:32] sick.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; That's only the first pool and the
[57:36] second pool.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the third pull,
[57:40] hallelujah, is emphasize on the soul.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need healing of our soul.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Speak healing. It speaks of
[57:49] joy.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Speaks of power. It speaks
[57:53] of life. It speaks heaven. And the same
[57:55] blood that was shed upon the ground that
[57:57] called out after his dead brother called
[57:59] out after his brother that was killed.
[58:01] The blood of Jesus Christ covers all of
[58:05] our sin.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blood is cover all our
[58:10] sin. past sin, present sins, and future
[58:14] sins.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And speak peace and
[58:18] resurrection
[58:20] &gt;&gt; and power and life and healing. All the
[58:23] redemptive blessings that the blood was
[58:25] shed for, it speaks for us. Certainly,
[58:28] the blood speaks.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the blood is still
[58:32] in effect? Hallelujah. He shed it in
[58:35] Calvary almost 2,000 years ago. But that
[58:38] blood is still in effect because that
[58:40] blood is a voice.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And if you believe it, hallelujah, God
[58:45] will set you free.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Because when you know the truth,
[58:49] hallelujah, there is freedom in truth.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; He will set you free.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; But Satan don't like you to think about
[58:56] that.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:59] In your mind, the devil will tell you
[59:02] he has power over you.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; In your mind, the devil will battle you.
[59:07] But the devil doesn't change God's mind.
[59:09] Remember that.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; He will bombard you of all negativity,
[59:14] but he cannot change God's mind about
[59:17] you.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He cannot dictate what was
[59:21] in God's mind about you.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The devil doesn't
[59:27] influence God's thinking. Remember that.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; He may accuse you of something of do
[59:33] this and do that.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; But thank God that the prophet said, "As
[59:38] long as we are in the flesh, we have
[59:39] sticky nature."
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet for letting us
[59:43] know about that.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; We can struggle in this life. We have
[59:46] disappointment. We have discouragement.
[59:49] But it cannot take away you being sons
[59:51] and daughters of God.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because you are
[59:54] predestinated even before the foundation
[59:56] of the word and not hallelujah and Satan
[1:00:00] cannot do anything about that
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; he will can discourage you he will
[1:00:04] bombard you all negativity but it cannot
[1:00:07] influence God's mind
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; because in God's mind you are already
[1:00:11] justified
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; you are justified in the first place
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; and what is the first place in the mind
[1:00:21] of God before the foundation word before
[1:00:24] he created the word, the stars, the
[1:00:26] moon, the molecule, you are already in
[1:00:28] his mind.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; And when you recognize your day, no
[1:00:33] amount of
[1:00:35] negativity will discourage you.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; You need to stand strong.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't make God see you
[1:00:45] different. But if you get under the
[1:00:47] influence of the devil, your mind, you
[1:00:49] will think that God is seeing you the
[1:00:51] way the devil is showing you your
[1:00:52] condition.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Remember that is just battle in your
[1:00:58] mind.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; That is only in your mind.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; But your heart is already anchored.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the word of God.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; The battle is always in the mind
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; but your heart is already anchored.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; You receive the covenant of peace.
[1:01:15] Whatever battle you are in, you are
[1:01:17] still under the covenant of peace.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural covenant.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:26] That is not what God see as you. This is
[1:01:29] the thin line between defeat and
[1:01:31] victory. Glory. We want to cross that
[1:01:33] line over into victory this morning.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; We want to come through the blood.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Because the blood is still in effect.
[1:01:45] There is power in the blood.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is redemption in the blood.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; There is joy in the blood. There is
[1:01:52] healing in the blood. Hallelujah. There
[1:01:54] is reconciliations in the blood.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And the blood is in the word of God.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why in Psalms 103, he
[1:02:04] said, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and
[1:02:06] all that is within me." Bless his holy
[1:02:09] name.
[1:02:10] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget
[1:02:12] not all his benefit.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; It is done. It is finished on Calvary.
[1:02:19] Whatever you've been through this
[1:02:20] morning, it is done. It is finished. And
[1:02:22] don't forget the benefit while he died
[1:02:25] for you, my brother and sister.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Whatever things you are doing, if you be
[1:02:29] sickness, family affair, whatever it is,
[1:02:32] it is done. It is finished. You just
[1:02:34] believe the word
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; because he said it is done. It is
[1:02:37] finished.
[1:02:39] Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; It's up to you to believe
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; because he has already declared himself,
[1:02:44] it is done. It is finished.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; That's why don't forget all his benefit.
[1:02:52] Who forgive all thine iniquities.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Forgiveth all thy iniquity.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; In other words, you are completely
[1:03:02] forgiven.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Justified.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as though you had never seen
[1:03:09] it in the first place.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; In Romans 8:12, there is therefore now
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; no condemnation to them which are in
[1:03:20] Christ Jesus.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; No more condemnation.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; So if Satan is trying to bombard you of
[1:03:27] all negativity things, hallelujah,
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; tell him I am already,
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; praise God, washed by the blood of Jesus
[1:03:35] Christ. And that blood is still in
[1:03:37] effect in these days.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, no more
[1:03:41] condemnations. Don't let Satan condemn
[1:03:43] you of all negativity. But praise God,
[1:03:46] if you're walking in the spirit, there
[1:03:48] is no more condemnation now.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Preach.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Don't be bullied by Satan.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Because if you know who you are,
[1:03:58] Hallelujah.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; He is powerless.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:04:06] Yes sir.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; There is no more condemnations to them
[1:04:10] which are in Christ Jesus.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Are you in Christ Jesus this morning?
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:04:18] the spirit?
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; For the law of the spirit of life in
[1:04:22] Christ Jesus made me free from the law
[1:04:25] of sin and death.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; We are already free.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes sir.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Why keep entertaining Satan when you are
[1:04:34] already free?
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; When you are free, you are free indeed.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Of course, we can commit still mistake.
[1:04:42] We we can be disappointed sometimes. But
[1:04:45] if we are walking in the spirit.
[1:04:47] Hallelujah.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; He is just a bluff.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Don't entertain him.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Or you can entertain him. It's up to
[1:04:59] you. Okay, Satan, what you're saying is
[1:05:01] true. Just like what brother Brham
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; when his daughter died and his
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; wife died and Satan come to him. Oh,
[1:05:11] look at your you you you are praying for
[1:05:14] for sick. You're praying you have divine
[1:05:16] healing but your daughter you cannot
[1:05:18] even save.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; You are preaching salvation and your
[1:05:22] father is not even saved.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Do you still want to?
[1:05:27] And he said, "Okay, what you're saying
[1:05:29] is right.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Everything is right.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; But when he tell the prophet, do you
[1:05:35] want to still
[1:05:38] serve him?"
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "The Lord giveth
[1:05:43] and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the
[1:05:45] name of the Lord." He can do whatever he
[1:05:47] want. We can agree with what he's saying
[1:05:48] about us. But nevertheless, the
[1:05:51] scripture say, "You are predestinated."
[1:05:53] Praise God. Whose report do you believe?
[1:05:57] If your life changed, is that your you
[1:06:00] you you are not the one who changed your
[1:06:02] life. It was the grace of God that
[1:06:04] changed your life.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And the evidence is you are serving God.
[1:06:08] So whatever he tried to put in your
[1:06:10] mind, I here I am.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; I am the testimony of the grace of God
[1:06:15] in my life.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Of course, I have born sin. Come to the
[1:06:19] word speaking life. I cannot do anything
[1:06:22] about that because I was born. There is
[1:06:24] a love. There is a love. There is a
[1:06:26] nature in my life and I cannot help it.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Even though I don't like to to sometimes
[1:06:32] tell a lie but it automatic you tell a
[1:06:34] lie.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; I cannot we cannot help it.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Because we are born in sin by one man
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; disobedience.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sin cometh to the word but
[1:06:49] by one man obedience to the word we are
[1:06:52] set free.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are being set free. We
[1:06:56] are an advocate. Hallelujah.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And we cannot even say praise the Lord
[1:07:03] without his grace in our heart.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; We cannot say hallelujah without this
[1:07:08] grace of God. We cannot say amen without
[1:07:10] the grace of God because we are born in
[1:07:12] sin. We were alienated from the presence
[1:07:14] of God.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; By why why we are here this morning.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; You are the testimony
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; of Christ. Thank you.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; You may not stand here and testify of
[1:07:27] what God has done in your life but by
[1:07:29] sitting alone. Hallelujah. That is the
[1:07:32] testimony that God is working in your
[1:07:34] life.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Because you have no capacity to come and
[1:07:38] worship God without his grace in your
[1:07:40] life.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Remember God don't look at church
[1:07:49] member. Right?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; When he come, when the son of man come,
[1:07:53] shall he find faith?
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; He need faith. He need revelation.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; So if there's anything that we want to
[1:08:00] come to church, we need revelations,
[1:08:02] Lord.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; We want revelation of grace.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; We don't want to become church member
[1:08:07] only.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; There is now therefore no condemnation.
[1:08:19] Now,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; not in the future. Now,
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. You need testify. No more
[1:08:26] condemnation now.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Don't struggle and don't struggle to
[1:08:34] always pity party.
[1:08:36] But if you are in Christ, there's no
[1:08:38] more condemnation.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Let him condemn what he wants, but let
[1:08:43] us stand by God's grace. Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; I am not what I used to be.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; But it was by God's grace that I am what
[1:08:51] I am now.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was the grace of God. So
[1:08:54] there is a Hebrew word shalom which is
[1:08:56] used extendedly throughout the Old
[1:08:58] Testament and it means to be a covenant
[1:09:01] of peace
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; with someone of whom you had fallen out
[1:09:05] with over something.
[1:09:09] Example, maybe they had stolen one of
[1:09:11] your
[1:09:13] cows or cars or something and it's
[1:09:15] caused a situations
[1:09:18] where peace had left your relationship
[1:09:20] with this person. Maybe he borrowed you
[1:09:23] some money and he he promised you to pay
[1:09:25] a month later
[1:09:27] but 10 years after he doesn't pay again.
[1:09:31] So it will mark your relationship.
[1:09:34] So to be able to enter into a covenant
[1:09:36] of peace it would be required to make a
[1:09:39] whole or good to restore and to make
[1:09:42] compensation.
[1:09:43] Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; So need to to compate you need to try
[1:09:48] to return your relationship.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; So this is what the work that Christ did
[1:09:54] on the cross for the human race in order
[1:09:57] to make whole what was forfeited by the
[1:10:00] first Adam. Christ paid the full price
[1:10:03] to make good the error and the penalty
[1:10:05] of sin that had come in between God. So
[1:10:08] God became man that he might become the
[1:10:11] very righteousness of God. God was in
[1:10:13] Christ reconciling himself.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:19] For he had made him to be sin for us who
[1:10:21] knew no that we might become made in the
[1:10:24] right of God. 2 Corinthians 5:21.
[1:10:28] So he bridged the gap, re peace between
[1:10:31] men and God again.
[1:10:34] And this covenant of peace that God has
[1:10:37] reestablished is not a temporal covenant
[1:10:41] but an everlasting covenant that is
[1:10:44] established for eternity.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; So the working of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:54] when he preached in 1956 he said and he
[1:10:57] write the commun in the old testament
[1:10:59] back in the holy of holies the
[1:11:02] commandment was wrote on the table of
[1:11:04] stone
[1:11:06] but he said after these days that I will
[1:11:09] pour out my spirit and I'll write my
[1:11:11] covenant upon the table of their hearts
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; and in their mind. Amen. Then God by the
[1:11:18] Holy Spirit confess faith in Christ
[1:11:21] bring the Holy Spirit that writes the
[1:11:23] covenant of peace across your heart.
[1:11:26] Then the spirit that was in Christ
[1:11:28] dwells in you and it makes you act
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; the Christlike life.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; And in there God has placed in this
[1:11:37] group of people which is called his
[1:11:39] body. Apostle, prophet, teachers,
[1:11:41] evangelist, pastors. Hallelujah. And
[1:11:44] Paul said it's for the purpose of
[1:11:46] defying the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; And some don't believe that there is a
[1:11:50] fivefold ministry.
[1:11:52] Praise God. But they are pastoring a
[1:11:54] church.
[1:11:56] How come they don't believe the
[1:11:57] five-fold ministry and they pastor a
[1:11:59] church?
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; So you are showing a different picture.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said hallelujah. God has
[1:12:08] placed in the group of people which is
[1:12:09] called his body. Apostle, prophets,
[1:12:12] preachers, evangelists and pastors.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; That is for the purpose to edify the
[1:12:17] body until we come into the unity of
[1:12:20] faith.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[1:12:28] And then
[1:12:33] uh working of the Holy Spirit paragraph
[1:12:36] 56
[1:12:38] uh 37. And then you think that after
[1:12:40] 2,000 years has passed by, the Lord
[1:12:44] Jesus is just as much alive tonight as
[1:12:47] he was back there.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Still with the church. So he preaches in
[1:12:53] 1956.
[1:12:55] He's still calling the church church.
[1:12:59] But after the opening of the seven seas
[1:13:01] in 1963,
[1:13:04] he no longer called you a church, but he
[1:13:06] called you a bride. Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Because at the opening of the seventh
[1:13:10] seal, he gather his subject unto himself
[1:13:13] and that is the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:15] In 1956, he called it still he is still
[1:13:18] in the church. But now, hallelujah.
[1:13:20] After the opening of the seventh seal,
[1:13:22] he is no longer calling you a church.
[1:13:24] You are calling you his bride.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; There is a relationship change. Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:36] The second place of the covenant is here
[1:13:39] with us, the Holy Ghost, writing out and
[1:13:41] doing the very same thing that he did
[1:13:43] when he was here on earth.
[1:13:46] And he said, "A little while and the
[1:13:48] world will see me no more."
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After his crucifixions, the
[1:13:54] world will see me no more.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; They will not understand about
[1:14:00] his move, about his works in the church.
[1:14:04] They will not understand him.
[1:14:07] That's why all the have no life.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; They have just sensations, emotions.
[1:14:13] They do that and they do this.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; They always believe in a historical God.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; But now Christmas is coming. People are
[1:14:23] preparing
[1:14:25] historical God. They know
[1:14:29] he was born in a manger
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; and visited by three kings.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then on the Easter they will
[1:14:38] reenact the crucifixion again.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; They are believing in historical God.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; But to believe in historical God will
[1:14:47] not give you life.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; But to know him in the power of
[1:14:52] resurrection will give you life. Because
[1:14:55] my spirit by word there are spirit and
[1:14:57] their life.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; We need to know him
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; in the present tense and he reveal
[1:15:02] himself by the revealing of the word.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; To know his story. God has no effect.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; But we need to know him in the power of
[1:15:10] resurrection.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is still with us.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; And a little while and the world will
[1:15:21] see me no more. Yet ye shall see me.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; You understand? Hallelujah.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; How I work in the seven church ages.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; I work from Paul up to this day.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; So that's why we understand the moving
[1:15:38] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; For I will be with you to the end of the
[1:15:43] word.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Isn't it marvelous? Hallelujah. I will
[1:15:47] be with you.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; He is with us this morning.
[1:15:53] Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; And we know that God has been reenacting
[1:15:59] out his great plan of redemption
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; since the fall in the Garden of Eden.
[1:16:04] And he could have told us everything
[1:16:06] about it in the first few chapter of the
[1:16:08] Bible.
[1:16:11] But he speak it out and spread it out
[1:16:14] and scared it little by little
[1:16:16] throughout the Bible from Genesis to
[1:16:18] Revelation. In other words, he sealed
[1:16:21] the picture of it in a different portion
[1:16:23] of the scripture.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because creation or
[1:16:30] redemption is greater than creation.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; He laid it out from Genesis to
[1:16:36] Revelation.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; It is not just like a a story book
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; that you you wrote the ending. You have
[1:16:43] the climax and you have the ending and
[1:16:44] you know everything.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; But here you cannot know.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is scattered all
[1:16:50] throughout. Even in the book of preview,
[1:16:52] Paul carth and he is written about
[1:16:54] himself in the volumes of the book.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Little by little, portion by
[1:17:00] portion. Here a little, here a little,
[1:17:02] there. So, it's just a mystery. It's a
[1:17:04] seal book and no one can understand it.
[1:17:07] Even we without the grace of God in our
[1:17:09] life, we cannot even understand it.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; We read the we read the Bible according
[1:17:14] to the denominational understanding of
[1:17:16] the book. So, that's why we cannot
[1:17:17] understand it. Yes.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; How many times we read about Sarah,
[1:17:21] Abraham, Easter, Rahab, yeah, Elers. We
[1:17:26] read all about that history without any
[1:17:28] any meaning about it.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; It's just a story in the Bible.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; About Samson, about Delilah. Just a
[1:17:37] story in the Bible.
[1:17:39] There was no life in it.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:45] But by God's grace,
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the revelation of who we
[1:17:50] are.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; The mystery of our life was hidden in
[1:17:54] the book.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; So he tell us first in Genesis 3:15
[1:18:00] to look out for his coming redeemer that
[1:18:03] will bruise the head of the serpent.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; And then in Isaiah he tell us that he's
[1:18:08] coming through the mankind through a
[1:18:09] virgin birth.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Then he tell us about out of all the
[1:18:13] nation this redeemer is going to come
[1:18:15] through Israel. Yeah.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; And he tell us somewhere else that it
[1:18:21] will be out of one of the 12 tribes and
[1:18:24] that is going to be through the tribe of
[1:18:26] Judah.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; And then out of the city in Judah, it is
[1:18:30] going to be out of Bethlehem.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And out of all the families in Bethlehem
[1:18:36] is going to be through the family of
[1:18:37] Jesse of which he will be the son of
[1:18:40] David.
[1:18:42] And so he scattered all this information
[1:18:45] in a small parts of prophecy
[1:18:48] all over the Old Testament in a way that
[1:18:51] is very hard to put it all together
[1:18:53] clearly to form a clear picture
[1:18:56] especi especially if we don't know what
[1:18:59] the picture is.
[1:19:03] So God could have written it all
[1:19:05] together in a narrative type
[1:19:08] way and made it clear in just a few
[1:19:10] chapter but he spread his mystery plan
[1:19:13] of redemption all throughout the Bible
[1:19:15] in a way that not even the devil with
[1:19:19] all his mark can put it together
[1:19:22] understand it correctly.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; So it was hidden mystery
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; and God does this in order to hide his
[1:19:29] plan from the devil so that his plan
[1:19:31] won't be thwarted. Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God knows about it. He He is
[1:19:35] the only one who know what he's doing.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; That's why he can say my thoughts are
[1:19:39] above your thoughts and my ways are
[1:19:42] higher than your ways.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We just need to come before
[1:19:46] him by faith.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; And so when you look at the revel book
[1:19:51] of revelation, it is written in the same
[1:19:53] way. It can be very confusing.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; So that's why every denomination is
[1:19:59] allergy.
[1:20:01] Don't touch about the book of revelation
[1:20:04] because it is very confusing.
[1:20:09] Hallelujah. And so God has written the
[1:20:10] Bible like this to throw a lot of people
[1:20:13] off the real truth of them seeing him of
[1:20:15] what his real character really is.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. So that's why there must be a
[1:20:20] special class of people
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; that what that will understand
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; his character
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; that was being revealed in the book
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; so many will stumble many will question
[1:20:36] but for the bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:20:39] just believe it
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; and some sometimes we cannot understand
[1:20:42] it we got confused but we still believe
[1:20:44] it.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; And we cannot help ourselves to believe
[1:20:50] because we are ordained to believe in
[1:20:52] these last days.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; this is the most deceiving age in all
[1:20:56] the ages.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; But for the bride, it is impossible to
[1:21:00] be deceived.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; That's why in Matthew chapter 13, he
[1:21:08] said, why? And the disciple came and
[1:21:10] said unto him, why speakest thou unto
[1:21:12] them in parables? He answered and said
[1:21:14] unto them, because it is given unto you
[1:21:17] to know the mystery of the kingdom,
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; but to them it is not given. So there is
[1:21:22] a special class of people to them and to
[1:21:25] you.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why when you
[1:21:28] receive the message of the hour, what a
[1:21:31] blessed people you are.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; You may have trials, you have my
[1:21:35] troubles, but just continue on because
[1:21:37] you cannot help it to believe the
[1:21:39] presence of the hour. When I first came
[1:21:41] to the message of the hour, I so rejoice
[1:21:43] because I I believe God sent a prophet
[1:21:46] in this last days. I read about the
[1:21:47] serpent seed and I believe it without
[1:21:49] any question.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; And when I share it to somebody else,
[1:21:52] there's a lot of question about it.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Can you find it in the Bible? Can you
[1:21:57] find this? Why this Eve have a children
[1:21:59] do this? So many question.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; But for me, when I receive it, that's
[1:22:03] it.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to explain, but I
[1:22:08] believe that it's true. Yes,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; it was not an apple, but there's
[1:22:11] something more than an apple
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; and I believe it with all my heart.
[1:22:15] Hallelujah.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; And as time goes on, there's a lot of
[1:22:17] confusion. The likes of Proctrin coming
[1:22:19] in may perushia, two soul, three soul,
[1:22:22] whatever doctrine. And I began to
[1:22:24] confuse about myself.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; But I convinced myself I believe there's
[1:22:28] a property in the land.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; I may not understand it. There is a
[1:22:32] double statement. I may not understand.
[1:22:35] But I believe Lord, you send a prophet
[1:22:37] in these last days. Amen.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Even if I cannot understand right now, I
[1:22:41] still hold on to it and I believe that
[1:22:43] you will reveal it as I continue to
[1:22:46] serve you.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you cannot understand,
[1:22:49] don't try yourself to understand it.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Just humble yourself. Believe that God
[1:22:54] will reveal something to you
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; in his time, in his season.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Because if you are sons and daughters,
[1:23:00] he is obligated to reveal himself to
[1:23:02] you.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Don't struggle. Hallelujah.
[1:23:07] Don't struggle to know more about him
[1:23:09] because but the more you struggle to
[1:23:10] know him, the more you go farther away
[1:23:12] from God.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Just need to humble yourself.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe that you sent the
[1:23:17] prophet.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; I believe you gave your life for me.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Whatever things I cannot understand,
[1:23:22] Lord, I humbled myself. Lord, I'm
[1:23:24] willing to learn your ways,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; not my ways.
[1:23:35] That's why the song
[1:23:37] I did it all my way.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; I think it's Frank Sinatra or something.
[1:23:45] And maybe they have a lot of voices,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; beautiful voices when they sing I did it
[1:23:51] all my way.
[1:23:53] But it turned out they all of them
[1:23:56] mostly all of them that sing sang I did
[1:23:59] it all my way and in tragedy
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; because you cannot
[1:24:06] walk your own way
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; because there is only one way.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ said I am the way
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; and I am the only way
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; and I am the only truth. God will lead
[1:24:21] you into all truth and the truth will
[1:24:23] set you free. And when you are free,
[1:24:25] then life manifestation. I am the way,
[1:24:28] the truth, hallelujah, will give you
[1:24:30] freedom.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Then we'll manifest life.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; praise be to God. So let us continue on
[1:24:39] to serve the Lord
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; with humbleness knowing if we are sons
[1:24:43] of who we have so many trouble. That's
[1:24:45] it. Yeah.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But thank God the prophet said that as
[1:24:48] long as you are in the flesh, you will
[1:24:49] have a sticky nature bothering you.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; You will be bothered by that sticky
[1:24:54] nature.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Which you are born in sin come to the
[1:24:56] world speaking lies.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; But if you are sons and daughters of
[1:25:00] God, you have a peace covenant with you.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; I may have battles but I am son of God.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; He may accuse me of something but I
[1:25:10] still stand as a son of God.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because I cannot believe
[1:25:14] this message unless God ordained me to
[1:25:16] believe it.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Not everybody can believe what you
[1:25:21] believe.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; So you need to rejoice. Don't focus
[1:25:24] yourself on this temporary thing. Focus
[1:25:27] yourself on what the word says about
[1:25:28] you.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Because if you believe
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; that you are sons and daughters of God,
[1:25:36] God is obligated
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; because he said, "I will be with you."
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Not only with you but
[1:25:43] in you
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; to the end of the world.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; We need to always put that in our mind.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; He is with us.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; If we have trouble that is okay. We are
[1:25:56] undergoing our testings and trial.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And when you recognize who you are, then
[1:26:01] let your test become your testimony.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Your me becomes your message
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; and your discipline. Make it an
[1:26:09] appointment with God to humble yourself.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, reveal yourself unto me, Lord.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; In Psalms 25:12, he said, "What man is
[1:26:20] he that fearth the Lord?
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Him shall he teach in a way that he
[1:26:26] shall choose."
[1:26:28] God has ordained chosen pathway for each
[1:26:30] one of us
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; to walk in this life.
[1:26:34] And he has ordained to teach you by the
[1:26:37] lessons and trials that he has placed
[1:26:39] for you along the pathway that he will
[1:26:41] lead you in. For the footstep of the
[1:26:44] righteous are ordered, arrange of God.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Nothing
[1:26:50] comes our way by chance.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Everything is ordered and arranged by
[1:26:55] God.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; So that his name will be glorified.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; His soul shall dwell at east and his
[1:27:02] seed shall inherit the earth. The secret
[1:27:05] of the Lord is with them that fear him.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; So the mystery of God revealed to the
[1:27:11] individual is what brings you into
[1:27:14] respect towards God. The secret of the
[1:27:18] Lord is with them that fear him and he
[1:27:20] will show them his covenant.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; So if you have respect, hallelujah, God
[1:27:25] will show you or reveal himself unto
[1:27:27] you.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why the prophet said if you
[1:27:31] cannot respect the person that is
[1:27:32] standing respect the opus
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; of the one that is preaching. Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Because if you look at the flesh the
[1:27:39] flesh has so many flaw
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; that you can pinpoint anything in the
[1:27:45] flesh.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said if you cannot
[1:27:49] respect the person respect the office of
[1:27:51] the person because the office is not the
[1:27:53] person it was God.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he has said that, he
[1:27:58] said, "Give unto men."
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave the fivefold
[1:28:02] ministry in order for us to come into
[1:28:05] the unity of faith.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; so if you have respect for God and for
[1:28:09] his word for this hour, then God will
[1:28:12] lead you in a pathway that he has chosen
[1:28:13] for you, hallelujah,
[1:28:16] for your life to bring you into a place
[1:28:18] where he can fully reveal himself to
[1:28:21] you.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; That's the secret. Respect.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Don't say anything. As the prophet said,
[1:28:31] if you cannot say good things about
[1:28:33] somebody,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; don't say nothing.
[1:28:42] We can see that in almost every good
[1:28:44] writer of novel first begin their story
[1:28:47] with setting out character of the story
[1:28:49] at the beginning
[1:28:51] and then they develop that character and
[1:28:53] narrative and as the story goes along
[1:28:56] they can make you love or hate the
[1:29:00] character simply by describing and
[1:29:03] developing the personality of the
[1:29:05] character in the words and actions of
[1:29:07] the car so that you become emotionally
[1:29:10] entangled with a character.
[1:29:14] That's how noble was.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; The more you read, you are into the
[1:29:18] climax into the ending
[1:29:22] and you don't realize at the ending if
[1:29:24] it is a tearjerker you are already
[1:29:26] crying.
[1:29:30] That is also how God is able to bring
[1:29:33] you into a relationship with himself
[1:29:35] over time by revealing to you little by
[1:29:38] little his true nature and character
[1:29:41] throughout your life. Slowly letting out
[1:29:43] more and more of his great purpose and
[1:29:46] plan of redemption.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; We just need to wait
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; for his God's grace.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are we are in God's hand.
[1:29:57] Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; So whatever we've been through, just
[1:30:00] hold on. In Jeremiah 29 verse 10 to 1
[1:30:16] and was also God that after 70 years be
[1:30:19] accomplished on Babylon, I will visit
[1:30:22] you.
[1:30:24] After 70 years, the testing of
[1:30:27] captivity, after 70 years be
[1:30:31] accomplished, I will visit you and
[1:30:33] perform my good words towards you in
[1:30:36] causing you to return to this place.
[1:30:43] We are in the hands of
[1:30:59] you an expected end
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; of peace and not of evil
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; to give you.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; So he is the one to give you.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; The word expected end means the things
[1:31:15] that you hope for.
[1:31:19] the outcome of what you have desired all
[1:31:22] along in your life's journey. It is God
[1:31:25] that has put that expected end in you
[1:31:28] from the beginning.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Unexpected end what the things that you
[1:31:33] hope for.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And some of us are hoping
[1:31:38] for something that expected end. We may
[1:31:41] have some troubles along the way.
[1:31:44] But we are praying and expected then
[1:31:46] that God our family will really
[1:31:48] reconcile whatever this is happening in
[1:31:51] your life during end because God put it
[1:31:54] and expectant put a desire in your
[1:31:56] heart.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Don't just
[1:32:04] long for
[1:32:07] wealth or career or whatsoever. Long for
[1:32:10] your expectant your family.
[1:32:14] Even had he right when he said that is
[1:32:16] the truth brother Brennham nothing but
[1:32:17] the truth
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; and the spirit was pleased that he told
[1:32:20] brother Bham tells you there what she
[1:32:24] wants
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; as their rights just don't even know
[1:32:29] what to ask
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; and brother Bernham is the one who
[1:32:32] encourage her you have so poor so if you
[1:32:34] just ask money God will instantly give
[1:32:37] you money
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; you have a sisters that is not is so
[1:32:41] sick
[1:32:43] Why don't you ask prayer that he will be
[1:32:45] she will be healed?
[1:32:47] So brother Bernham is encouraging her
[1:32:49] but her unexpected and is for the
[1:32:53] salvation of her children
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; and when he spoke it God hallelujah
[1:32:57] ordained it
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; and his sons come. Amen. So God put a
[1:33:01] desire in our heart. Our hope hallelujah
[1:33:04] our hope our family will get in touch or
[1:33:07] the family or children whatsoever or
[1:33:10] loved ones.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:13] That's true.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Things that you hope for, the outcome of
[1:33:16] what you have desired all away in your
[1:33:19] life.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; It is God that has put that expected end
[1:33:23] in you from the beginning. Joseph was
[1:33:26] brought through all of his trials to
[1:33:28] unexpected end.
[1:33:30] Ruth was brought through all the trials
[1:33:33] to unexpected end. And so will you and I
[1:33:36] also come through all our trials
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; to unexpected end.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Ruth was brought through all of her
[1:33:45] trials to an expected end.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And so will you and I also come true.
[1:33:50] You and I is no exception.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; We will come through our expected end.
[1:33:54] God has placed a desire deep within the
[1:33:56] heart of man for peace and joy and
[1:33:58] fulfillment and fellowship.
[1:34:04] Man was not designed to end.
[1:34:08] Man wasn't designed for his end to be
[1:34:11] that of suffering and hardship. Do you
[1:34:13] believe it?
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; That is only necessary for a short
[1:34:17] season of your life in order for you to
[1:34:19] be able to appreciate the contrast of
[1:34:22] eternal blessings that has in store for
[1:34:25] those that love him.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Trials cannot compare to the
[1:34:31] blessings that is being in stored about
[1:34:33] us.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All those trials, even Job,
[1:34:37] no one can compare the trial of Job.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But at the end of the day,
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; his expected end, his wealth, his
[1:34:46] children were returned to him double in
[1:34:50] double. [music]
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; And I believe each and every one of us
[1:34:56] will experience the same. Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; So in this in this world that we are now
[1:35:04] living, Satan is trying to create his
[1:35:08] Eden
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; through scientific knowledge and
[1:35:12] everything that he wants to bombard.
[1:35:14] Praise God the people so that their mind
[1:35:17] can turn away from the presence of the
[1:35:19] Lord. Amen.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; In the message, the broken sister and
[1:35:23] the prophet said
[1:35:25] they say today by joining these things
[1:35:27] and by making this word council of
[1:35:29] churches that they're going to make a
[1:35:32] better place to live in.
[1:35:34] We can see all around even the in in
[1:35:36] pinnish area there's a lot of buildings
[1:35:38] apartment everything complexes not only
[1:35:42] here maybe all over the world they seems
[1:35:45] to forget that the Lord is coming.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're not concerned about the
[1:35:49] coming of the Lord. They're concerned
[1:35:50] about the prosperity and all the
[1:35:52] business and all to become big to have.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; They're going to make a better place to
[1:35:59] live. To my honest opinion, they're
[1:36:02] going to make a better place to sin in.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; That's just the whole thing is sin
[1:36:07] anyhow. Not to live in, but to die in.
[1:36:12] make its place to sin instead of live
[1:36:14] in. Any other thing outside of Jesus
[1:36:18] Christ and his word of life is a broken
[1:36:21] system.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Anything that tries to substitute it,
[1:36:25] anything that you try to do to bring you
[1:36:27] peace, anything that you try to do bring
[1:36:29] you comfort, any kind of joy that you
[1:36:32] receive from anything else as you to
[1:36:36] this is a broken system full of filth.
[1:36:39] Yeah,
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; he gives perfect satisfaction.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Only God can give us perfect satis. We
[1:36:45] may not own a lot of money. We may not
[1:36:47] own a big houses. We may not have a good
[1:36:49] cars, beautiful cars. But if we have
[1:36:52] him, we have everything.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; The message God of this evil age. Now
[1:37:01] let's watch it manifested. He say he is
[1:37:04] making a better world for them to live
[1:37:06] in by his knowledge apart from the never
[1:37:11] failing word of God but by his coming
[1:37:13] together in denominations and creeds
[1:37:16] intellectual scientific and so forth. He
[1:37:18] is making a better world for a man to
[1:37:21] live in and ignoring the promise of God
[1:37:24] that the only time the world will be fit
[1:37:26] to live in is in the millennium.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's only in the
[1:37:32] millennium.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; You know my opinion. He made a better
[1:37:35] word to sin instead to live in.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Notice did he do it? He legalized sin.
[1:37:42] He legalized whiskey drinking, cigarette
[1:37:44] smoking and in the churches legalized
[1:37:47] that woman could be member of the
[1:37:49] church. Even they allow woman to preach.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; With short hair. Now may you stop just a
[1:37:56] minute? Yeah,
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; she can wear short, wear paint and still
[1:38:00] belong to his religious group which is
[1:38:02] absolutely contrary to the word of God.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; He say it's all right. See his
[1:38:08] knowledge. What that got to do with a
[1:38:12] woman just the same as taking the
[1:38:14] forbidden fruit or the forbidden fruit.
[1:38:17] That's what it is. God said not to do
[1:38:19] it, but he does it anyhow.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; And she believes him and she loves him
[1:38:25] for it. She hates God. Her own action
[1:38:28] proves she does.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; She says she believe God but their
[1:38:32] actions
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; tell the different
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; she say she love him but she love Satan.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; She love him but actions love Satan
[1:38:44] because in this word
[1:38:47] the Satan is the god of this evil age.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; She worshiped the god of passion, the
[1:38:52] god of the word, the god of hollywood
[1:38:55] goddesses. She loves him, but she hates
[1:38:58] the true word of God,
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; which is the only true God there is. Did
[1:39:04] you catch it? The true word of God is
[1:39:07] the only true God there is.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; So you as an individual receive the true
[1:39:13] word of God for this day, then that is a
[1:39:15] very unique thing in the eye of God that
[1:39:18] puts you in the specific group of
[1:39:20] believers and nothing else should matter
[1:39:23] to you. Amen.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And this relationship that you have with
[1:39:28] God in the light of the truth of this
[1:39:29] hour is what establish this covenant of
[1:39:31] peace between you and God. It is the
[1:39:33] message of God that will establish you
[1:39:36] between God and you. Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And so God's covenant
[1:39:40] of peace concern you in this hour is his
[1:39:44] assurance to you that he will fulfill
[1:39:47] the promise of his word and take you out
[1:39:50] above judgment of what is coming upon
[1:39:53] his word just the same as it was in
[1:39:55] Noah's day because he promised it that
[1:40:00] he will never again judge the earth
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; but his mercy
[1:40:05] is renewed every morning.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. his mercy, hallelujah,
[1:40:11] renewed every morning. This is the
[1:40:12] covenant of peace that he had given us
[1:40:14] in this day. Just as root entered into
[1:40:17] rest upon Boa's word that was rebuilt at
[1:40:20] the midnight hour. This is the same
[1:40:22] promise that we have received in this
[1:40:24] hour.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; We are now entering the midnight hour.
[1:40:27] Hallelujah. And we have the promises of
[1:40:29] God in these last days.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So his covenant of peace is
[1:40:34] his word promised to you by the message
[1:40:36] that has sent to you for this hour. We
[1:40:38] are to hold fast to that word of truth
[1:40:40] of what God has called you to stand for
[1:40:43] in this last days. We need to hold fast
[1:40:46] the word that was being revealed. Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; So you don't come by accident. It is
[1:40:51] God's ordained that is trying to reveal
[1:40:54] his covenant of peace with you. We may
[1:40:57] have troubles in life. We may have
[1:40:58] chastisement. We may have rebuke. But
[1:41:01] his grace is more. Hallelujah. as he
[1:41:05] shows in his character, his grace is
[1:41:07] more everlasting and neverlasting.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; So he was not speaking to Allah's
[1:41:12] people. He's speaking directly to his
[1:41:14] people.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; The Israel, his wife, his widow wife. He
[1:41:18] is speaking personally to them.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; And this message is speaking personally
[1:41:23] to each one of us as a member of this as
[1:41:26] a member of a body of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:28] Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Revelations 225 26. But that which you
[1:41:33] have already, hold fast till I come.
[1:41:36] What you have already is the revelation
[1:41:38] of who himself, of who he is in your
[1:41:41] life. So hold fast.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan bully you, intimidate
[1:41:48] you. Just hold fast.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because what you are holding
[1:41:54] now is an eternal life.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; The life of Jesus Christ in you. And he
[1:41:58] promised he will be with you even in you
[1:41:59] until the end of the world. Whatever
[1:42:01] you've been through, there's always a
[1:42:03] peace covenant with the people of God.
[1:42:04] An everlasting covenant.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even if you commit mistakes,
[1:42:09] hallelujah. God bypass it.
[1:42:12] Lord,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; because he knows that we sons and we
[1:42:15] don't decide to commit sin.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Every time we commit sin, there is a
[1:42:19] there is an inside teacher that will
[1:42:21] tell us, "Oh, that's wrong."
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; And we automatically ask forgiveness for
[1:42:25] our sin. And he is faithful to forgive
[1:42:27] our sin. If we confess our sin is able
[1:42:30] and hallelujah, God is so good.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; But that which ye have already hold fast
[1:42:37] till I come. And he that overcomemeth
[1:42:39] and keepeth my works unto the end, to
[1:42:41] him will I give power over the nation.
[1:42:44] How? As the prophet said, how did I get
[1:42:47] my power?
[1:42:49] I didn't get power when I stand there
[1:42:51] and preach and divine healing. No, I get
[1:42:53] my power
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; in my closet.
[1:42:57] That's right.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, spiritual prayer
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; through prayer.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Not because you're studying a many group
[1:43:05] of people this divine. Even the brother
[1:43:08] even brother Brandon said the healing is
[1:43:09] not mine
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; and I draw don't draw people to follow
[1:43:15] me
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; but I draw people to Jesus Christ.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Because he is faithful to his calling.
[1:43:26] When I meet the pillar [clears throat]
[1:43:27] of fire in Ohio, he heard a voice as
[1:43:29] John the Baptist forun the first coming
[1:43:31] of Christ. Your message will forrun the
[1:43:33] second coming of Christ. And he was
[1:43:34] faithful to that calling. So I didn't
[1:43:37] draw all the people to come, but I
[1:43:39] introducing to you Jesus Christ,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; the son of man. Thessalonian 5:21,
[1:43:47] prove all things, hold fast that which
[1:43:49] is good, abstain from all appearance of
[1:43:52] evil. Amen.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you
[1:43:56] holy. And I pray that your whole spirit
[1:43:59] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[1:44:02] unto the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:04] Christ.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Because faithful is he that calleth you
[1:44:08] who also will.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; So meaning of hold fast in Greek word
[1:44:15] means to embrace tightly.
[1:44:18] Hold on to something tightly to prevent
[1:44:21] it from being taken away.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So then Lord, Satan bully
[1:44:26] you. You need to hold fast tightly. I am
[1:44:29] a son of God. You need to you need to to
[1:44:32] speak it. I am the son of God. I am the
[1:44:34] son of God. I am the son of God. Because
[1:44:36] that is the real message of the hour to
[1:44:39] let you know who you are. And when you
[1:44:41] know who you are, Satan cannot stand
[1:44:44] against it.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes sir.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; We have our identity being restored in
[1:44:51] these last days
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; from all those previous years we have
[1:44:55] this amnesia. We don't know who we are.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; But every time we go scroll the
[1:45:00] scripture we know something is something
[1:45:02] is bubbling something we cannot
[1:45:03] understand it. I know I remember
[1:45:06] something. I know I remember something.
[1:45:07] As the brother said when you are in
[1:45:09] amnesia there is no doctor can help you
[1:45:11] recover.
[1:45:13] Yeah,
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; you just need maybe some a close friend
[1:45:16] of yours and bring you to a place where
[1:45:19] you will recognize it.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe to a park
[1:45:24] and then you will look at it and try to
[1:45:27] remember.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; I've been through this. I just can't
[1:45:31] remember where. But I know I'm familiar
[1:45:34] with this place.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Come to a place. Oh, I know this
[1:45:37] brother, he called my name, but I can't
[1:45:39] remember.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Just like the eagle story, brother
[1:45:45] Bernham.
[1:45:46] Hallelujah. The eagle is just been in
[1:45:48] the chicken yard and he don't know what
[1:45:51] he's
[1:45:52] he looks familiar with the other
[1:45:54] chicken.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And he thought like a chicken. He act
[1:45:58] like a chicken. He ate like a chicken.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; But deep down in her heart, there was
[1:46:04] something different.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Something I cannot explain. Something I
[1:46:07] cannot
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it is. But one day
[1:46:11] there is an eagle scream. Hallelujah.
[1:46:13] And he recognize he resonate to the word
[1:46:16] to the voice that he heard. Hallelujah.
[1:46:18] I am that voice.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; I am that mystery. And we recognize now.
[1:46:23] So you need somebody to bring you to a
[1:46:26] place that you are familiar with. And we
[1:46:28] need a prophet in this last day that
[1:46:30] bring us out to the vir.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He showed me that I have
[1:46:34] been in Ruth. He showed me that I have
[1:46:37] been in Easter. He show me I have been
[1:46:39] in Rahab. He show me I have been I
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; He will walk me all the way from Genesis
[1:46:46] to Revelation. He show me I am in Noah.
[1:46:49] He show me I am in the Bible. He show me
[1:46:51] I am in Gideon. He show me I am all the
[1:46:54] way through.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; And I realized hallelujah I am the book.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. [cheering]
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he open the book he
[1:47:01] called my name.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; How do you call your name?
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; By revelation of by revealing the
[1:47:07] mystery of who you are. Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; I now I saw my name. That is why.
[1:47:12] Hallelujah. I recognize sister. I
[1:47:14] recognize all these testament character
[1:47:16] because they speak volume about me.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; It become alive.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; And this book become a new book.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; This open book is a title deed over
[1:47:28] redemption.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; It's time to go home. My brother and
[1:47:31] sister. It is now time praise God to
[1:47:33] pity party. It's time to encourage
[1:47:35] yourself. It's time to look up
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; for a redemption is draw at night.
[1:47:40] Hallelujah.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; You can see all around us. Volcano.
[1:47:43] Hallelu. Exploding eruption. Earthquake
[1:47:46] here, earthquake there. Praise God.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Didn't you read what Paul said?
[1:47:54] The earth is in birth pain,
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; waiting and groaning for the
[1:47:59] manifestations of the sons and daughters
[1:48:00] of God.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; They are hallelujah. groaning
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; for the millennium.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Because the earth cannot hold.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; There's always a flash flood because
[1:48:14] there is an illegal lugging, illegal
[1:48:17] mining, all that. They
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; they corrupted the earth.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; So that's why the earth is now growing.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; They say they have a climate change, but
[1:48:26] that hallelujah is groaning,
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; waiting for the manifestation of sons
[1:48:31] and daughters of God. That's right.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; So we need to look up.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; We need to stand as son as daughters of
[1:48:38] God. Don't be afraid of the intimidation
[1:48:41] of Satan because we God over his
[1:48:44] covenant of peace. An everlasting
[1:48:46] covenant.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Galatian 5:1 Standfast therefore in the
[1:48:54] liberty where Christ hath made us.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Stand fast therefore in the liberty.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The message of the hour set us
[1:49:04] free.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; So if Satan dictate you, just
[1:49:11] agree with him.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; But don't give in with him.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, okay, I can still
[1:49:20] commit lie. I can still have disappoint.
[1:49:22] That's right. That's right. That's
[1:49:23] right.
[1:49:25] But as the prophet said, the Lord giveth
[1:49:27] and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the
[1:49:29] name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Stand fast therefore in the liberty
[1:49:33] where
[1:49:36] Christ hath made us free.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; And be not entangled again with the yoke
[1:49:42] of bondage.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Be not entangled. Don't
[1:49:45] struggle and struggle and struggle. The
[1:49:47] more you struggle, you become entangled
[1:49:50] and you don't know what will happen.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Just claim your God-given rights.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like in Joshua said, he said
[1:50:00] that in Joshua
[1:50:03] chapter 1 verse 7, only thou be strong
[1:50:06] and be courageous.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Let us be strong
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; and be courageous that thou mayest
[1:50:12] observe to do according to the law which
[1:50:14] Moses my servant commanded. Be strong in
[1:50:16] the revelations of what the prophet had
[1:50:18] been sent in these last days.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Turn not from it or write. Don't add to
[1:50:23] it or take away from it. Don't make your
[1:50:26] own interpretations. Praise God.
[1:50:28] According to the message of the hour
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; from to the right and to left, but thou
[1:50:32] mayest prosper in whatsoever goeth thou
[1:50:35] goest. You will prosper in revelation if
[1:50:38] you stay in the word of God.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Stay in the message of the hour. Don't
[1:50:42] entertain any doctrines or praise God.
[1:50:46] Any other doctrine or any other
[1:50:48] interpretation, stay with the word.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Stay with the word and you'll prosper.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Your revelations will prosper. Amen.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; This book of the law shall not depart
[1:51:01] out of thy mouth.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Because in Revelation 8, John was
[1:51:08] commanded, "Take the book and eat it."
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; And thou must prophesy, don't take it
[1:51:15] away from your mouth.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Take the book.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; The book of the law shall not depart out
[1:51:21] thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate
[1:51:23] therein day and night. thou mayest
[1:51:25] observe to do according to all that is
[1:51:27] written therein. For then thou shalt
[1:51:29] make thy way prosperous,
[1:51:32] and then thou shalt have good success.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Don't find anything
[1:51:41] or any that can tingle your ears.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Of revelation,
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; just stay simple.
[1:51:52] Stay simple and humble
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; because when God reveals something, it's
[1:51:56] always in simplicity.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; That even the common people understood
[1:51:59] it.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He don't use word flowery
[1:52:03] word that we cannot understand that we
[1:52:04] will miss just single iota of his word.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Because he said that every kama, every
[1:52:09] line, every if you cannot find Christ in
[1:52:12] your Bible, read it again because Christ
[1:52:14] is in every verse and every line, every
[1:52:16] kama, every everything it was in Christ.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us go back to the word and
[1:52:22] become simple. Then we God will prosper
[1:52:24] us.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and
[1:52:31] of good courage. Be not afraid neither
[1:52:33] be
[1:52:34] thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[1:52:37] worthy whatsoever thou goest.
[1:52:39] That's always says when the seventh seal
[1:52:41] was open. When the mighty angel coming
[1:52:43] down with an open book, he set his right
[1:52:45] hand the right feet upon the land and
[1:52:47] upon the sea and it say the time is no
[1:52:48] more. Amen.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; He never go back.
[1:52:52] He is still with us here.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; And he keep unfolding himself to us.
[1:52:57] Unfolding his word little by little.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Little by little. Little little by
[1:53:01] little. You don't need flowery words.
[1:53:04] Hallelujah. To to embrace him. Just
[1:53:06] little by little.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Be not afraid neither thou be dismay.
[1:53:14] And dismay is to overwhelmed by fear,
[1:53:17] discouragement, distress,
[1:53:19] open to the point of being shattered or
[1:53:21] broken in spirit.
[1:53:24] It implies a loss of courage and
[1:53:26] resolution.
[1:53:29] So if you are looking in some channel of
[1:53:32] YouTube, just make sure you follow just
[1:53:34] one.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:38] Although we have pastors, we have
[1:53:40] associate ministers, sometimes we
[1:53:44] looking for a supplement.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Just like we are eating regular meal,
[1:53:51] but we need supplement. Vitamin D,
[1:53:53] vitamin D3, vitamin D1, vitamin B12. We
[1:53:56] need supplement. But make sure the
[1:53:59] supplement that you're looking can help
[1:54:01] you
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; not to confuse you
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; because there's a lot in the YouTube
[1:54:06] channel that will confuse you.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; But if you find something hallelujah
[1:54:11] that will that you feel that you can
[1:54:13] grow in that supplement,
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; stay with it.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; You have your
[1:54:22] regular meal.
[1:54:26] We have pastor here. We have associate
[1:54:28] that can feed you but we need supplement
[1:54:31] too.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible ministry is to edify
[1:54:34] the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:40] So last quote
[1:54:42] trying to do God a service without it
[1:54:45] being
[1:54:46] God's will.
[1:54:49] He mentions when no one is group. So
[1:54:51] there is always a group of people. As
[1:54:53] the prophet said, brother Bernham will
[1:54:56] represent us.
[1:54:59] So if you're looking for eight messenger
[1:55:01] or somebody, no one will represent you.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Because only the seventh messenger in
[1:55:07] this last day which was vindicated by
[1:55:09] God, that is the only voice in this last
[1:55:11] day
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; because God sent Elijah to you
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; to turn your heart back to the father
[1:55:17] and he will be the one to represent us
[1:55:20] to God.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why we are called the
[1:55:23] group
[1:55:25] group of believers
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; just like when Noah and his group. So
[1:55:29] God brea is so specific because only
[1:55:32] Noah and his group
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; miss the judgment.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; When they saw the message nothing else
[1:55:42] matter.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When they saw praise God the
[1:55:46] message of the hour nothing else matter.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of accusation. There's a
[1:55:50] lot of accusation. There's a lot of
[1:55:53] backbiting among but then when he saw
[1:55:56] praise God the message of the art
[1:55:57] nothing else matter.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; It comes to my mind about Abraham as I
[1:56:04] while while I was
[1:56:07] you know when when God appeared to
[1:56:09] Abraham he was already 75 years old.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; God knows that he cannot already produce
[1:56:18] because he was old. Yeah,
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; God knows everything about us.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; He know that he cannot produce a child
[1:56:30] because he was already old, 75 years old
[1:56:33] and also Sarah.
[1:56:35] But when God told Abraham,
[1:56:39] you become a father of many nation,
[1:56:43] Abraham didn't figure it out.
[1:56:47] How can I be?
[1:56:50] How can I be a father of many nation?
[1:56:53] He didn't struggle
[1:56:55] upon that word.
[1:56:57] He didn't have an anxiety. I cannot
[1:57:00] sleep and try to figure out what what
[1:57:02] was that. He tried to figure out. But
[1:57:04] what he did, he just believed it and
[1:57:06] that's it. Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; He don't have any problem about sleeping
[1:57:10] or anxiety or nervousness because of
[1:57:13] thinking of so much of what it's that
[1:57:15] that I hear.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; He just believe it and that's it.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; And it was imputed unto him for
[1:57:23] righteousness. He didn't struggle. He
[1:57:25] didn't figure it out. He just believe
[1:57:26] the word.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Just like us, we just need to believe
[1:57:30] the word.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; When we see the word in these days,
[1:57:33] nothing else matter.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; When Moses saw group, nothing else
[1:57:38] matter. When John saw John's group saw
[1:57:42] it, nothing else matter.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; When Jesus group saw it, nothing else
[1:57:46] matter.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; When the apostles saw it, nothing else
[1:57:49] matter.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Nothing else matter. When Luther's group
[1:57:52] saw it,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; then just live by faith.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Nothing else matter. Although he was
[1:58:00] smoking,
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; he is believing in a trinity doctrine.
[1:58:03] But he saw his message and nothing else
[1:58:05] matter.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; God will vindicate the me the message of
[1:58:08] the hour. When Jen or Luther saw it
[1:58:13] when Wesley saw it, Pentecostal saw it,
[1:58:16] nothing else matter. And may I add, when
[1:58:18] the bride saw her position, nothing else
[1:58:21] matter.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because when you know who
[1:58:24] you are, then the rapture will go.
[1:58:26] Nothing else matter. Amen.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Our career, our everything that we own
[1:58:31] or only nothing else matter.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; We cannot bring anything that we achieve
[1:58:35] here. Nothing else matter. When we saw
[1:58:37] the message of that the most important
[1:58:39] thing
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Pentecost saw it nothing else matter.
[1:58:48] And may when the bride saw it, nothing
[1:58:50] else matter. They pull away from
[1:58:52] everything. Why?
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; By his forn knowledge. He predestinated
[1:58:57] the things to happen. So he chose his
[1:59:00] own person by his fornowledge.
[1:59:02] Nothing else matter.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; When the bride saw her position, nothing
[1:59:07] else matter.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; All the upset in the message, nothing
[1:59:11] else matter.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; All the disappointment don't matter. All
[1:59:14] the trouble the message don't matter.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; What matters that you see in your day
[1:59:19] and this message because that is the
[1:59:21] evidence
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; of the covenant of peace in your upon
[1:59:25] your life. Amen.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; The covenant of peace is an everlasting
[1:59:29] covenant.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything's
[1:59:33] nothing else.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Every stand to our feet.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; If we see
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; our life in the scripture,
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; nothing else matter
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; because he said whatever you need
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; don't think about tomorrow
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; what you eat or what you will do
[1:59:56] whatever
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; we know that there's a lot of recessions
[1:59:59] a lot of praise God of uh
[2:00:04] works
[2:00:06] being uh shut down a lot of businesses
[2:00:09] being shut down.
[2:00:12] But for the bride, nothing else matter.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Because the script don't think about
[2:00:16] tomorrow
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; because your heavenly father knows what
[2:00:19] you best for you.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; But instead, seek ye first the kingdom
[2:00:23] of God
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; and his righteousness and his kingdom is
[2:00:26] in the word of the hour
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; and all your needs will be added. All
[2:00:32] your needs will be add. He will be the
[2:00:33] one to add it to your needs. You just
[2:00:36] need to let you know who you are. Amen.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; And when you know who you are, you have
[2:00:40] a peace
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; This covenant of peace of God,
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; is his covenant with his people.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; And you are the covenant people of God.
[2:00:53] A covenant that can be removed. A
[2:00:55] covenant and everlasting covenant.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; We just need to thank him. We just need
[2:01:00] to praise him. [music]
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Every battles that we've been through,

[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; You may be in the mountain, just praise
[2:01:10] him. You may be in the valley, just
[2:01:11] praise him.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Everything is under control.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; you're expectant and what you hope for,
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; God will give it to you.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.

[2:01:26] Take
