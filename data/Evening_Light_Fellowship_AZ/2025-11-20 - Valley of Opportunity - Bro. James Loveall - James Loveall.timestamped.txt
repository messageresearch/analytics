[31:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't have time to have an
[31:25] expectation for tonight.
[31:29] But what if I WAS TO TELL you Jesus was
[31:32] going to come by tonight? Come on.
[31:34] That's right.
[31:35] He was going to come walk by your pew.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; He was going to walk the aisle.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; What would your expectation be?
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Because when I read my Bible,
[31:50] &gt;&gt; I read stories of the woman with the
[31:52] blood issue.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; She said, "If I can only
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; touch the hymn of his garment."
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; I don't need to speak to him. Come on.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; I just want to touch him.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, sometimes
[32:29] I become a baby in your presence, Lord.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:33] because I've studied and I've waited
[32:42] &gt;&gt; and I know you have something for your
[32:43] people this evening.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; And so, Father, would you just open the
[32:48] floodgates
[32:50] &gt;&gt; of your presence? Would you pour
[32:51] yourself out once again? We have come
[32:54] hungry. We have come thirsty.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; We have come with our cups, oh God. And
[32:58] we WANT OUR CUPS TO OVERFLOW. SO,
[33:01] FATHER, would you come and just break
[33:03] the bread of life to us this evening as
[33:05] we walk through your scriptures? Would
[33:07] you come and talk to us?
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, we have a desire. We have a
[33:13] hunger. We have a longing, oh God, to
[33:17] know more of you.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to tell you how much we
[33:23] love you.
[33:28] because in loving you, we want to serve
[33:30] you, oh God.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; So, Father, would you come? And I'm sure
[33:36] there's needs across this building and
[33:39] those streaming. And
[33:41] Lord, you are the same yesterday, today,
[33:43] and forever. And
[33:45] &gt;&gt; your presence is here. And you promised
[33:47] in your word. And so, we're going to
[33:49] take you at your word this evening.
[33:53] Come open our eyes of understanding.
[33:56] Give us revelation. Give us anointing.
[33:58] Oh God, I set aside myself. And
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, come.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Speak to us once again.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; We love you and we'll be sure to give
[34:09] you the praise, the honor, and the
[34:11] glory.
[34:12] For you are worthy of it all.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; In Jesus precious name. Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:21] You love him this evening. Yes, sir.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; And he's a good God.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to the scripture there. Thank
[34:29] you, musicians
[34:32] to Second Kings
[34:35] chapter 3 and we'll go to Ezekiel 37
[34:40] and Psalms 23.
[34:48] And we'll be coming back to these
[34:50] portions of scripture. So hold your
[34:52] places here in 2 Kings 3 and 16. And it
[34:56] said, and he says, "And he said, thus
[34:58] sayeth the Lord, make this valley full
[35:01] of ditches."
[35:02] In Ezekiel 37,
[35:05] turn over to Ezekiel 37.
[35:09] The hand of the Lord was upon me and
[35:11] carried me out in the spirit of the Lord
[35:13] and set me down in the midst of the
[35:15] valley which was full of bones and
[35:18] caused me to pass by them round about.
[35:20] And behold, there was very many in the
[35:22] open valley. And lo, they were very dry.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; And he said unto me, Son of man, can
[35:28] these bones live? And I answered, Oh
[35:30] Lord, thou knowest.
[35:45] And again he said unto me,
[35:49] prophesy unto these bones
[35:53] &gt;&gt; and say unto them,
[35:55] &gt;&gt; oh we dry bones.
[36:04] Hear
[36:07] the word of the Lord.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Psalms 23.
[36:34] If you're there, say, "Amen."
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Let's just read this together. Psalms 23
[36:43] and verse one.
[36:45] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[36:47] want. He maketh me to lie down in green
[36:50] pastures.
[36:54] waters
[37:03] through the valley of the shadow of
[37:05] death. I will fear no evil.
[37:21] Surely goodness and mercy follow me all
[37:25] days of my life and I will dwell in the
[37:28] house of the Lord forever.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; And everybody said
[37:32] &gt;&gt; amen.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated this evening.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; So this evening I would like to just for
[37:43] a moment
[37:47] talk on the valley of opportunity.
[37:50] Valley of opportunity
[37:53] with the subject of do you live?
[37:58] Now we see here that David is painting
[38:00] two different pictures and I had put
[38:03] here in the the they had put here in the
[38:05] slideshow. I gave him some pictures. Do
[38:07] we have those that we can see here that
[38:10] David is
[38:12] pointing to two two different pictures
[38:14] here. He says, and he begins to talk
[38:16] about green pastures.
[38:20] And in green pastures, we know and it
[38:22] symbolizes a peacefulness, an abundance,
[38:24] a security, a protection
[38:29] of a shepherd, the rest, and the safety,
[38:32] the plentifulness of his blessings in
[38:34] our lives,
[38:36] overabundance of rain and green that in
[38:40] those green pastures. And he says, "He
[38:42] lays me beside the steer waters, which
[38:45] is the river of life. And there's
[38:47] comfort, there's safety there."
[38:50] &gt;&gt; And I, as I was thinking about over in
[38:53] New Zealand, there's more sheep than
[38:54] people. And you see the vastness of all
[38:57] the greenery over there and all these
[38:59] fat sheep that just sit there.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; They have nothing to worry about.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Beet down in that valley, they have
[39:08] nothing
[39:10] just to worry. and there's a shepherd
[39:11] that's looking over him. And then we see
[39:14] that he's talking about the valley of
[39:16] the shadow of death through the trials
[39:19] and the sickness and the hard times that
[39:21] we may face and dry seasons and
[39:23] uncertainty and unsure,
[39:29] &gt;&gt; a valley that's unclear,
[39:32] but yet it's just a shadow.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Because there's something greater.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:39] There is something greater. Listen to
[39:41] what the prophet said. He says, "So many
[39:43] make a terrible mistake on this one
[39:46] scripture and that is in Psalms 23. They
[39:48] read it like this. Yay, though I walk
[39:50] through the dark valley of the shadow of
[39:53] death." Now, there's no such thing. The
[39:54] Bible doesn't say it. The dark valley or
[39:57] the dark valley of the shadow of death.
[39:59] Says, "Though I walk through the valley
[40:00] of the shadow of death." Now, before it
[40:03] can be a shadow, it has to have a light
[40:06] to make that shadow. See, David being a
[40:08] prophet and under an anointing, he
[40:10] didn't make a mistake.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; He just said the truth. Yay. Though not
[40:14] I walk through a dark valley, but
[40:17] through the valley of the shadow of
[40:19] death.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; He says, then you have to have a certain
[40:22] percent of light to make a shadow.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is here. We are both
[40:27] natural and supernatural. This body is
[40:30] subject to death and was brought forth
[40:33] by a woman, not by nothing but through,
[40:35] not by God. You're a reproduction from
[40:38] Adam and Eve. Be black, white, whatever
[40:41] you are, you are reproduced.
[40:45] He says, an offspring of Adam and Eve.
[40:47] He says that makes your body born in
[40:49] sin, shaped in iniquity, come into the
[40:52] world, speaking lies, you were damned
[40:53] and condemned at the beginning of your
[40:56] life, not even without a chance.
[40:59] not even without a chance. But yet it's
[41:02] just the shadow because he says to a
[41:05] believer there's no such thing as death
[41:07] because there's a greater life.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; And when you step into that light, it
[41:11] becomes JUST A SHADOW BECAUSE DEATH HAS
[41:14] NO HOLD on the believer. But what it is
[41:16] is you begin to step from this life to
[41:19] the other life.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; That's why he can say I have no fear
[41:24] &gt;&gt; of the valley of the shadow. So we walk
[41:28] through valleys.
[41:32] Valleys are a part of our Christian
[41:34] walk, a part of our Christian journeys.
[41:37] And we have mountaintop experiences. And
[41:39] yet we find as we go through life and
[41:42] the older we get, you find that there's
[41:44] more valleys than there is mountain
[41:46] peaks.
[41:49] There's more valley times that we spend
[41:56] &gt;&gt; because it is in the valley is where you
[41:57] are proven.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; It is in the valley where your fruits
[42:02] begin to grow. It is in the valley where
[42:04] you begin TO PRAY AND YOU'LL find
[42:05] yourself down on your knees a lot more
[42:07] when you're in the valley.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] It is in the valley
[42:16] that you pray yourself through
[42:19] because at the end of the valley you see
[42:21] the next mountain that you might peak
[42:24] that you might crest and you desire to
[42:26] reach that mountaintop and so you gaze
[42:29] up there. What is it your prayers are
[42:31] pushing you through?
[42:38] It is in the valley where you strive,
[42:41] you persevere.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; But I can testify this evening
[42:50] that the same God on the mountain is the
[42:52] same God in the valley.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It don't matter to a
[42:55] believer if you're down in the valley or
[42:57] up on the mountain. The God that Jesus
[43:00] Christ is still the same yesterday,
[43:02] today, and forever.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; He's still the one leading you. He's
[43:05] still the one guiding you.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:11] So as I begin to think that if we can
[43:15] understand valleys
[43:17] then we can understand what God is
[43:19] trying to do and the opportunities he
[43:22] has in those valleys.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Valleys of opportunity. They're not low
[43:31] points in our lives or trials or hard
[43:33] times, dry seasons, but opportunities
[43:36] that God is trying to show us. And he's
[43:39] trying to bring forth something in you.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Nature shows us that there's all kinds
[43:46] of different valleys.
[43:49] And to save time, I was going to put
[43:51] some pictures, but to save time, nature
[43:54] shows us that you have a valley that is
[43:56] formed, and it's a V valley, and it's
[43:59] formed through streams and rivers,
[44:01] something small. And then you have a U
[44:04] valley that can be formed over time from
[44:06] what a collacure would have come through
[44:08] and knocked out a whole entire mountain
[44:10] and caused another valley.
[44:14] You have wide valleys
[44:17] that a big river would run through
[44:21] and all these valleys are formed in
[44:24] different ways and over different time
[44:27] frames.
[44:31] If you could pull up the two pictures.
[44:33] So I had just looked up two different
[44:36] valleys.
[44:39] I Google imaged what is a beautiful
[44:42] valley and all these valleys pulled up
[44:45] of Switzerland in between and you see
[44:48] that it's green and it's lush and then
[44:51] you have a desert valley
[44:54] and as I begin to look at these two
[44:56] different pictures and outside of the
[44:59] obvious that one is green and it has
[45:01] life and then you have one that is
[45:05] scarce.
[45:11] One lacks water, one has water.
[45:15] But what stood out to me between these
[45:17] two pictures and
[45:20] God began to deal with me
[45:24] was the distance between
[45:26] the mountains.
[45:29] Look how narrow the green valleys are.
[45:31] That we have green valleys in our lives
[45:33] and God gets us there and that's where
[45:35] we grow and that's where we're maturing.
[45:39] But yet when we go through a desert
[45:40] valley, when we go through a hard trial,
[45:44] it seems like that mountaintop is so far
[45:46] away.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S WAY off
[45:54] in the distance.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Yet God doesn't keep his people on the
[46:02] mountaintops, nor does he keep them just
[46:04] in green pastures.
[46:07] But he puts them in desert valleys to
[46:10] find the character of his sheep.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; He sends us through valleys to see what
[46:16] we're made of.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say that he would
[46:19] even send a church through a desert
[46:21] place to find out the response of the
[46:24] people.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; He would send a church through a desert
[46:29] place. Why? Because whenever water
[46:31] doesn't happen, and we'll get some
[46:33] quotes that when water doesn't come
[46:35] down, what happens in a desert? You guys
[46:37] are desert people.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Everything's spooky.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Everything has thorns. Why?
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Because it has no water. It has no
[46:46] moisture.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; He says that is how a church can get in
[46:52] a condition.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; That I want to send them to see what
[46:56] they're made of.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; I want to see the character of the
[46:58] people.
[47:00] You watch a a church will go through a
[47:03] desert place and they'll find themselves
[47:04] and then you start getting hearing the
[47:06] people talk. You'll find out what those
[47:08] people are made of.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; They begin to jump from church to
[47:11] church. WHY? BECAUSE THEY'RE trying to
[47:13] hit the mountaintop of every single
[47:14] church.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; They're trying to avoid the valleys in
[47:17] their lives where God wants them to
[47:19] grow, where God wants them to mature.
[47:30] He says here and how the angel came to
[47:32] me. He says, "You notice another thing
[47:35] about nature and wherever you find it
[47:37] out in the desert of Arizona and around
[47:39] you find that there's a group." He said,
[47:41] "Everything out there where there's no
[47:43] rain, it always got a sticker on it.
[47:46] Every weed you get a hold of it has a
[47:48] sticker on it." Well, you take them
[47:50] weeds and you come here where they got a
[47:53] lot of rain and it doesn't have any
[47:54] sticker on it. That's a good lesson.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; He says, "See, if a church is all dry,
[47:59] no spirit in it, then they get all these
[48:01] little stickers boosting around." He
[48:03] says, "You need a good oldfashioned Holy
[48:05] Ghost rain, DON'T YOU? THAT'LL soften
[48:07] you up."
[48:09] &gt;&gt; He says, "And the church can't do it
[48:11] hurt yourself. It takes God to do it
[48:13] with you."
[48:14] &gt;&gt; God can't do it without you, and you
[48:16] can't do it without God. Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; I like it.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; That's why it's not something that you
[48:20] can work up, you can manufacture because
[48:23] sometimes God wants to send you through
[48:24] a desert place.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; He says, "And then Jesus called." He
[48:35] says, "Maybe some said the church has
[48:37] been a little kind of dry for a while.
[48:39] We've had an we haven't had any fresh
[48:42] water for a few months. We haven't had a
[48:45] revival. Looks like everybody's so
[48:46] stagnant and some or something or
[48:48] another. Just go to church and sing a
[48:50] hymn and hear a few messages and go.
[48:54] It's a dry season for the church.
[48:58] We become so stagnant and complacent. We
[49:02] become content.
[49:07] He says, "But all of a sudden
[49:11] &gt;&gt; that when we begin to get dry, then
[49:13] Jesus comes on the scene."
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; He freshens us up. He brings something
[49:18] new to us. He is always there to do
[49:20] that. A new hope comes when Jesus comes
[49:23] in. His presence brings a new hope.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; His presence brings a new hope. Why?
[49:29] Because when Jesus comes around, things
[49:31] happen. When Jesus comes around,
[49:34] atmospheres change, temperatures change,
[49:37] the the whole everything begins to
[49:39] change.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Begins to soften up a church.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; He brings that rain to soften our hearts
[49:49] and soften our attitudes
[49:52] because we become more stagnant than
[49:54] stirred.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; We become MORE COMPLACENT. HE WOULD TALK
[50:00] ABOUT THE THE Lake Michigan and how that
[50:02] the water and he said the the the the
[50:05] water was having a revival. WHAT IT WAS
[50:07] IT? IT WAS GETTING THE TRASH OUT OF ITS
[50:09] LIFE.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; CORRECT.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; NO NEW WATER needed to be added to that.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; It had exactly what it needed.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; It just needed to be stirred up a little
[50:20] bit.
[50:23] But yet on the other hand, some desert
[50:25] places that we go through, we go through
[50:27] desert valleys and it's because of
[50:30] decisions that we make, choices that we
[50:32] choose. Right.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Second Kings chapter 3.
[50:47] 2 Kings chapter 3
[50:51] and verse 6. And the king Jehoram
[50:54] went out from Samaria at the same time
[50:56] and numbered of all Israel. And he went
[50:58] and set Jehoshaphat the king of Judah,
[51:00] saying, the king of Moab has rebelled
[51:02] against me. Wilt thou go
[51:05] with me against Moab to battle to
[51:07] battle? And he said, I will go.
[51:10] I am as thou art, my people as thy
[51:12] people, and my horses as thy horses. So
[51:14] these two kings, he comes to him. He
[51:17] says, will you go to battle with me?
[51:20] &gt;&gt; And these two kings are the same people.
[51:22] They c they're they're the people of
[51:23] Israel and they're going out. So they
[51:25] have the same God and they're going
[51:26] against an enemy, the same enemy. And
[51:30] they said, "We'll come together, but
[51:32] watch because brother Brandham says in
[51:34] the valley full of ditches," he says
[51:36] Jorum, he says, was a borderline
[51:38] believer.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; He says he was a little lukewarm. He
[51:42] says he would listen to the people and
[51:44] he would begin to lower the standard
[51:47] &gt;&gt; and influences begin to creep in. Yeah.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; But then he knew that he can go to
[51:52] Jehoshaphat was a righteous man. And he
[51:55] says, "I want to take that man over to
[51:57] battle with me because he's a righteous
[51:59] man."
[52:00] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham would say, "Watch
[52:01] who your company is.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Watch the man who's leading you. Watch
[52:05] where this brother's taking you. Don't
[52:07] give your ear to anybody.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; That's good advice.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; You begin to listen to voices and here
[52:13] and there and different things. Be
[52:15] careful.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. be careful where they want to lead
[52:19] you.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; But Jehoshaphat was a righteous man and
[52:25] he held the standard. He believed in
[52:27] God. He knew God's word.
[52:31] And verse eight says
[52:34] and he said, "What? Which way shall we
[52:36] go?" And he answered, "The way through
[52:40] the wilderness of Edom."
[52:42] Pull up that picture of Edom. And I just
[52:44] began to think that this man began to
[52:47] say, "I I want to take you to battle.
[52:50] I want to take you to a place. I need
[52:52] you to go with me." But yet he wanted to
[52:55] go into a dry desert place with no
[52:58] water, no provisions.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; They were going to fight the same enemy.
[53:06] THEY WERE GOING TO GO STOMP ON DEVILS.
[53:08] THEY WERE GOING TO GO BEAT THEM.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; But yet there was no water.
[53:15] They begin to counsel amongst themselves
[53:17] and left God out of the equation.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Let's read the quote. And they went
[53:23] seven days in the wilderness and never
[53:25] fetched the compass. He says, "And it
[53:27] came, come to find out they got in
[53:29] trouble. They went out without
[53:30] counseling God and all the water supply
[53:33] was cut off." That's what the matter
[53:35] with the church. SHE SAYS THE WATER
[53:37] SUPPLY IS CUT OFF. Trying to carry the
[53:39] church without the supernatural and
[53:41] trying to carry the church on just the
[53:43] natural. Trying to pattern after other
[53:46] churches of the world. That's the reason
[53:48] we're not having the blessings we used
[53:50] to have. Why? Because we're trying to
[53:52] compare one with another. We're trying
[53:53] to go out there.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Instead of following the leadership of
[53:56] the Holy Spirit.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Be careful with men that say, "LET'S GO
[54:02] DUMP ON DEVILS." YOU CAN GO STOMP on
[54:05] those devils, but make sure he HAS A WAY
[54:07] OF WATER TO PROVIDE for you
[54:14] &gt;&gt; because Jehoshaphat, he knew that
[54:17] whenever they got in this position
[54:24] that in verse 9,
[54:27] and so the kings of Israel went and the
[54:30] king of Judah and the king of Edom and
[54:32] they fetched the compass is seven days
[54:34] journey. Watch this. Seven days journey
[54:36] and a compass of seven days. I didn't
[54:39] know what fetched a compass means. I I
[54:41] didn't know. So, I looked it up. It's a
[54:43] long circular journey of seven days.
[54:50] And there was no water for the host or
[54:52] the cattle to follow them.
[54:56] And so, we see they got put in this
[54:58] position.
[55:00] But yet Jehoshaphat knew.
[55:05] He knew that God has his ways. AND HE
[55:08] SAYS, "IS there not a prophet in the
[55:10] land? IS THERE NOT A PROPHET that we can
[55:12] inquire? Is there not a man that knows?"
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; And they went and fetched Elisha. And
[55:18] they came unto Elisha. AND ELISHA SAID,
[55:20] "WHAT? WHY ARE YOU HERE? WHY ARE YOU
[55:22] SPEAKING to me?" He says, "Why don't you
[55:24] go TO YOUR PROPHETS OF YOUR FATHER AND
[55:26] YOUR MOTHER?" after they went into
[55:28] idolatry, after they left the message,
[55:30] after they left it.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Why don't you go and ask them for help?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Why don't you ask them to provide for
[55:37] you?
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. That's the truth.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; But Jehoshaphat knew he was a righteous
[55:42] man.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; He knew his Bible. He knew that God had
[55:46] promised them a victory over the
[55:48] Moabites. He knew that they had victory
[55:50] over all of all those enemies. Right.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And he said, "God didn't call us three
[55:56] kings together just to go, but he he
[55:59] called us together to go and defeat the
[56:01] Moabites."
[56:05] And so Elisha gave him something to do.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; He says, "You need water."
[56:15] Let's read verse 16.
[56:18] And he said, "Thus sayaith the Lord,
[56:19] make this valley full of ditches. For
[56:22] thus sayaith the Lord, ye shall not see
[56:24] rain, nor ye shall or see wind, nor you
[56:26] see rain. Yet that valley should be
[56:29] filled with water that ye may drink both
[56:32] ye and your cattle and your beast." You
[56:33] see, this is a valley that God seen
[56:36] these these men, they put themselves in
[56:38] this position.
[56:40] But what did he do? He he looked at it
[56:42] as a valley of opportunity.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He says, "You might be without
[56:47] water, but this is a valley of
[56:50] opportunity that might work through you
[56:52] guys that I might get you to understand
[56:55] that you might not see wind. You might
[56:57] not see rain." What is that? EVIDENCE OF
[56:59] GOD COMING. YOU MIGHT NOT SEE IT, but
[57:01] you better start digging because WHEN
[57:03] YOU START DIGGING, GOD WILL FILL THOSE
[57:05] DITCHES.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; AND THE MORE DITCHES YOU HAVE, THE MORE
[57:09] WATER'S GOING TO BE THERE.
[57:12] THAT'S
[57:13] &gt;&gt; SO WE NEED TO start digging ditches
[57:16] &gt;&gt; because when we did dig the ditches, let
[57:18] me say God will provide the water.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; God isn't going to start bringing the or
[57:25] the water until we start digging the
[57:27] ditches.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; And the problem WITH IT IS SOMETIMES WE
[57:30] GET TOO COMFORTABLE. WE GET COMPLACENT.
[57:32] AND WHAT IS IT? OUR DITCHES are too
[57:34] shallow. Come on.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been digging a ditch way
[57:39] too long.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Or maybe you DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO dig
[57:43] a ditch.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; I've seen young men work today and they
[57:46] don't even know what a shovel is. They
[57:48] might know what a shovel is. They don't
[57:49] know how to get behind a shovel.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Young men, we need to learn how to dig a
[57:54] ditch. I'm not talking naturally.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; I'm talking spiritually.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Start digging deeper in the word of God.
[58:01] Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Start digging deeper in this message.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; If your VALLEY IS GETTING DRY, START
[58:07] DIGGING DITCHES.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Because when we begin to dig, IT'S ON
[58:11] US.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; And God will provide the rest.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't I don't see it
[58:18] coming." Well, you don't have to see it
[58:20] coming. You don't have to feel it
[58:21] coming. But whenever you're digging, LET
[58:23] ME TELL YOU, GOD IS ALREADY BRINGING THE
[58:25] ANSWER TO YOUR PRAYER.
[58:28] Yes sir.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Why? Because in 18 he says, "And this is
[58:36] a light thing." Somebody say, "A light
[58:38] thing."
[58:38] &gt;&gt; This is a light thing unto the Lord.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And he will deliver the Moabites also
[58:44] into your hands. And ye shall not smite
[58:46] you sh you you shall smite every f city
[58:50] and every choice city and shall and
[58:52] shall fail every good tree and stop
[58:54] every well and mar every good piece of
[58:57] land with stone and it shall come to
[58:59] pass in the morning. Listen, it shall
[59:01] come to pass in the morning that when
[59:03] the meat offering was offered that
[59:05] behold there came water by the way of
[59:08] Edom and the country was filled with
[59:11] water. So, not only do we got to dig a
[59:14] ditch, not only do we got to prepare for
[59:16] water, but we got to offer a meat
[59:18] offering unto the Lord.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "What is a meat offering?" IT
[59:23] IS NOT A BLOODY SACRIFICE.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; A meat offering, the primary components
[59:30] are fine flour and olive oil and
[59:32] frankincense. The Hebrew word meal is
[59:35] Milka, meaning a gift.
[59:38] It has reference to any gift presented
[59:41] to God. Here it is a reference to the
[59:44] Israelites presenting this meal offering
[59:46] in thanksgiving for God's love and
[59:48] goodness bestowed upon them.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[59:52] &gt;&gt; gratitude
[59:53] &gt;&gt; and thankfulness.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what he's telling us
[59:57] to do? Not only do you got to dig
[59:59] ditches, but you got to start thanking
[1:00:01] God and offer your meat offering unto
[1:00:04] him way before he even brings it to you.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; START THANKING HIM FOR WHAT HE'S DONE
[1:00:09] FOR YOU. START THANKING him for your
[1:00:11] healing. If you're GOING THROUGH A HARD
[1:00:12] TIME, start thanking him. IF YOU DON'T
[1:00:15] HAVE A JOB, START THANKING HIM AND
[1:00:16] PRAISING HIM AND SAY, "GOD, YOU ARE
[1:00:18] GOING TO PROVIDE."
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; He's waiting for you to be thankful of
[1:00:24] his love and his goodness.
[1:00:27] START RECIPROCATING THAT SAME LOVE BACK
[1:00:29] TO HIM BEFORE HE EVER GIVES YOU A
[1:00:31] BLESSING.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; You start thanking him. You start
[1:00:39] praising him. Let me tell you, he said
[1:00:41] he'll pour out more than we could ever
[1:00:43] handle, more than we had ever desired.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; That's true. Yes, sir.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; So, as I begin to think about this, that
[1:00:53] if we bring it to our day, even as we
[1:00:56] watch God all down through time, what
[1:00:59] has he been doing? He fetched the
[1:01:01] compass of seven church ages that he
[1:01:04] would go round about and he's going to
[1:01:06] bring it back to the very beginning once
[1:01:08] again.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; He's going to take us out and HE'S GOING
[1:01:10] TO GO AND HE'S GOING TO SOJIER AND HE'S
[1:01:12] GOING TO SEND HIS PEOPLE THROUGH
[1:01:13] MOUNTAIN TOPS AND THROUGH VALLEYS.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:18] But yet he said I in the water
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; we need to draw from the fountain saints
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; that never runs dry.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; That all through seven church ages and
[1:01:32] it seems so dark and it seems so dry and
[1:01:35] it seemed like the people put themselves
[1:01:37] in a position but yet God looks at it as
[1:01:40] a valley of opportunity to show forth
[1:01:42] himself.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:54] See the prophet,
[1:01:56] not even the prophets were exempt
[1:01:59] from valleys in their time.
[1:02:07] Well, notice here that if we turn over
[1:02:10] to Ezekiel,
[1:02:13] that isn't amongst the valleys, that he
[1:02:16] begins to deal with the prophet there.
[1:02:20] And he begins to show us that he would
[1:02:24] show his prophets things beforehand. He
[1:02:26] would show them the very end of things
[1:02:28] that are to be. He would show them the
[1:02:30] the end goal, the end the end of it all.
[1:02:34] to give him a hope, to give him a an a
[1:02:38] desire, not only a desire for and and a
[1:02:40] love for the people,
[1:02:42] but he WOULD SHOW HIM THAT TO ENCOURAGE
[1:02:44] THEM. And he would show him that before
[1:02:47] he showed them the condition of the
[1:02:49] people.
[1:02:52] Let's turn to Ezekiel 36.
[1:02:56] And that's why the the prophet would go
[1:02:58] behind the curtain of time and God would
[1:03:00] begin to show him his converts. He would
[1:03:02] show them that these are the ones that
[1:03:04] have made it over because of your
[1:03:05] ministry. Why? Because it gave him an
[1:03:07] encouragement. He would say, "IT'S ALL
[1:03:09] WORTH IT." AMEN.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Whenever you labor and you struggle and
[1:03:13] YOU GO THROUGH DARK VALLEYS AND HARD
[1:03:16] VALLEYS AND DRY places
[1:03:22] in Ezekiel 36 and he says, "For I bring
[1:03:25] I will take from among you the heathens
[1:03:27] and gather you out of all countries and
[1:03:29] bring you into your land. And then will
[1:03:31] I sprinkle water clean water upon you
[1:03:35] and ye shall be clean from all your
[1:03:37] filthiness and from your idols will I
[1:03:39] clean you." Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; A new heart will I give you. A new
[1:03:42] spirit will I put in you. I will take
[1:03:45] away the stony heart out of your flesh.
[1:03:46] And I will give you a heart of flesh.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; And I will put my spirit within you and
[1:03:51] cause you to walk in my statutes. And ye
[1:03:53] shall keep my judgments and do them.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; And ye shall walk in the land that I
[1:03:58] gave your fathers, and ye shall be my
[1:04:00] people, and I will be your God. That's
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; it. That's
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Now listen in verse 33. He says, "Thus
[1:04:07] sayaith the Lord, in the day that I
[1:04:09] shall have cleansed you, cleansed you
[1:04:11] from from all your iniquities. I will
[1:04:15] also cause you to dwell in the cities
[1:04:16] and in the waste shall be built it up
[1:04:20] shall be builded, and the desolate land
[1:04:22] shall be tilled. Whereas I lay desolate
[1:04:25] in the sight of all that pass by." And
[1:04:27] they said, "This land that was desolate
[1:04:30] has become like the Garden of Eden,
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; and the waste and desolate and ruined
[1:04:35] cities are become fenced and inhabited."
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; And then the heathen that is left round
[1:04:41] about you shall know that I the Lord
[1:04:43] built the ruins and planted in the
[1:04:45] desolate.
[1:04:47] I the Lord have spoken it and I will do
[1:04:51] it.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; I will do it. What is he doing on all
[1:04:55] these seven church ages? is a compass of
[1:04:57] seven. He's taking us back to the Garden
[1:04:58] of Eden and they are going to be the
[1:05:00] ones that testify this is like the
[1:05:03] Garden of Eden.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And so we come to this portion here in
[1:05:10] chapter 37 that I wanted to get to.
[1:05:15] And verse one says, "The hand of the
[1:05:17] Lord was upon me and carried me out in
[1:05:19] the spirit of the Lord. And he set me
[1:05:21] down in the midst of the valley which
[1:05:22] was full of bones
[1:05:25] and caused me to pass by them round
[1:05:27] about. And behold, there was very many
[1:05:29] in the open valley. And lo, it was very
[1:05:31] dry. So we have no life, death, total
[1:05:36] destruction. There's nothing."
[1:05:38] It seems like a situation that is
[1:05:41] impossible.
[1:05:44] In Romans 6:23 says the wages of sin is
[1:05:48] what?
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Death.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; That a people can get
[1:05:55] at this place because they draw
[1:05:58] themselves from God. Because they walk
[1:06:01] away. You see ones that walk away FROM
[1:06:03] THE MESSAGE. THEY WALK AWAY FROM CHRIST.
[1:06:05] What happens?
[1:06:07] Their lives become ruined. Their
[1:06:09] everything falls apart.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; That's true. People out there are w
[1:06:14] searching for something.
[1:06:17] They're looking for life,
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; but yet they don't have a purpose. They
[1:06:21] don't have nothing.
[1:06:23] And they walk through life,
[1:06:27] but yet the wages of sin is death.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] Yet God looked at this valley,
[1:06:35] not of a valley of impossible,
[1:06:38] not a valley of man, there's all these
[1:06:41] people and I I've I've catered to them
[1:06:43] and I love them and they're my CHOSEN
[1:06:45] PEOPLE AND I BROUGHT THEM HERE AND
[1:06:47] THERE'S the condition that they're in.
[1:06:50] SO, PROPHET, WHAT I WANT YOU TO do is I
[1:06:52] want you to go down.
[1:06:54] I'm going to put you in this valley of
[1:06:57] dry bones.
[1:07:00] Show me the picture.
[1:07:02] And you see these bones are all
[1:07:04] scattered throughout the valley.
[1:07:12] And it seems like all hope is lost.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; But yet God looked at it as a valley of
[1:07:20] opportunity.
[1:07:26] He didn't say, "Prophet, I want you know
[1:07:27] what? The people put them in themselves
[1:07:29] in this condition. You know what? I'm
[1:07:31] going to go raise up a whole another
[1:07:32] group. I'm going to get rid of them and
[1:07:34] I'M GOING TO THROW THE CLAY AWAY." BUT
[1:07:36] GUESS WHAT? GOD DIDN'T THROW THE CLAY
[1:07:38] AWAY.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; He didn't throw these people off and
[1:07:41] SAID, "OH, I'LL JUST START OVER."
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; But he looked at these bones and he
[1:07:47] said, "Sir, Ezekiel, can these bones
[1:07:50] live?
[1:07:56] And with our own carnal reasoning, you
[1:07:59] look at that VALLEY THAT SEEMS
[1:08:01] IMPOSSIBLE, FULL OF DRY BONES, and you
[1:08:03] would say, "Sir, there's no way, God."
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; But what did he tell him to do? HE SAID,
[1:08:13] "PROPHESY TO THESE BONES. NOT LAY HANDS.
[1:08:16] NOT JUST GO AND GATHER THEM UP AND TRY
[1:08:18] TO PIECE THEM TOGETHER, BUT I WANT YOU
[1:08:20] TO PROPHESY. WHAT IS PROPHESYING? IT IS
[1:08:22] SPEAKING THE WORD of God.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise his name. Praise his name.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; And because these bones are a part of
[1:08:32] the word, they have to respond.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; They had to respond TO THE THE WORD THAT
[1:08:37] WAS spoken for their day.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; That if they didn't resurrect, they
[1:08:41] weren't a part of God. Right?
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Only those that are A PART OF GOD,
[1:08:46] WHENEVER HIS WORD goes forth, YOU BEGIN
[1:08:49] TO RESPOND TO THE WORD. THAT'S WHY YOU
[1:08:51] COME ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THAT'S WHY
[1:08:53] YOU COME TO SERVICE BECAUSE THE WORD IS
[1:08:55] BEING SPOKEN AND THE WORD is life.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; And it might be a valley of impossible.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; But yet his word brings life.
[1:09:18] I'm so thankful he didn't come. God
[1:09:21] didn't look at that valley
[1:09:24] and just say, "I'll start over."
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Do you know why he couldn't start over?
[1:09:30] Because those bones were a part of him.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Those are God's chosen people, a
[1:09:39] covenant people.
[1:09:41] And he says though they get in that
[1:09:43] conditional
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; and God always sends a prophet.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Why do you think we need a prophet in
[1:09:53] this day?
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Because it's not the words of a man.
[1:09:59] It's not the words of just a prophet.
[1:10:01] But what you're responding to is the
[1:10:03] voice behind the voice.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to speak the word of God.
[1:10:07] It's not my words this evening. It's not
[1:10:09] the quotes OF A PROPHET, BUT IT'S THE
[1:10:11] WORDS OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; That whenever they're preached,
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; that when it's preached, it falls on
[1:10:24] your lot to respond to the word of God.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't throw away that which he
[1:10:35] began.
[1:10:39] But he says, "I'm going to revive that
[1:10:41] which I already have.
[1:10:43] I'm going to revive those people and
[1:10:45] bring them forth with my own words, and
[1:10:49] I'm going to bring life back into them.
[1:10:52] Prophesy the word of God that they may
[1:10:54] live."
[1:10:58] You may think that you're too far gone.
[1:11:02] You may think that you you've sinned
[1:11:04] your way day AWAY YOUR GRACE. YOU MAY
[1:11:07] THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST A PILE of
[1:11:09] dead bones. But let me tell you, when
[1:11:11] the word of God begins to ministered
[1:11:14] unto you and you respond to the word,
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; you might be an archaeological dig. Some
[1:11:21] of you have been maybe laying around for
[1:11:22] a long time.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Maybe you JUST BEEN COMING TO CHURCH AND
[1:11:28] YOU'VE BEEN SITTING AND YOU'RE NOT
[1:11:29] RESPONDING. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN
[1:11:31] GOD BEGINS TO ALL HE HAS TO DO, HE
[1:11:33] DOESN'T need no hammer and a chisel and
[1:11:35] he's got to be careful. Well, you know
[1:11:36] what he does, Malachi? He speaks his
[1:11:38] word. And whenever the word begins to go
[1:11:40] forth, YOU BEGIN TO RESPOND TO IT.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; IT begins to bring forth life. IT BEGINS
[1:11:45] TO BRING FORTH THIS SENU THAT COMES OUT.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; THE BONES BEGIN TO GATHER THEMSELVES
[1:11:51] TOGETHER. WHY? Because there's something
[1:11:54] happening.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:55] Hallelujah.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you might be in archeological dig,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; but let me tell you this evening.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; God's in the digging business.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; God is in the digging business. It don't
[1:12:10] matter how dead how long you've been
[1:12:12] dead. It don't don't matter HOW LONG
[1:12:13] YOU'VE BEEN down there. LET ME TELL YOU,
[1:12:15] IF YOU'RE A SON OF GOD, IF YOU'RE A
[1:12:17] DAUGHTER OF GOD, YOU WILL COME TO him
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; and he will revive you WITH HIS WORD.
[1:12:23] IT'S NOT SOME WORKED UP EMOTION. IT'S
[1:12:25] NOT COMING AND YOU GOT TO DANCE AND YOU
[1:12:27] GOT TO DO THIS. NO, IT'S HEARING THE
[1:12:29] WORD OF GOD AND THEN YOU RESPOND BACK TO
[1:12:31] GOD.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; That's what's reviving you.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Verse seven. So I prophesied I was
[1:12:44] commanded and as I prophesied there was
[1:12:46] there was a noise. Listen, there was a
[1:12:48] noise and behold the shaking. And the
[1:12:50] bones came together bone to bone. In a
[1:12:52] body there's 20 what? Six bones. How did
[1:12:55] what bone know where to go?
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; A valley full of bones.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And they begin to come together. And
[1:13:06] when I behold, lo the sin who and the
[1:13:08] flesh come upon them and the skin
[1:13:10] covered them above. But there was no
[1:13:13] breath in them.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO LIFE in them. Listen, you
[1:13:17] can come to church AND YOU CAN BE PUT
[1:13:19] TOGETHER AND you can walk IN AND STILL
[1:13:21] NOT HAVE LIFE.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BREATHING, just
[1:13:26] because you HAVE BLOOD IN YOUR VEINS,
[1:13:28] DOESN'T MEAN THAT you're living.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you're alive.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's true, brother.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:42] He says in the restoration of the bride
[1:13:44] tree he said the four killers took it.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Four messengers destroyed it. Four
[1:13:52] messengers of death took it among away
[1:13:54] and dog's four messengers of
[1:13:56] righteousness restored her back again.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; He said pro prophecy prophesy son of man
[1:14:02] can these bones live? He said what's the
[1:14:05] four stages of the coming forth of that
[1:14:07] church? He says, "Watch the four stages
[1:14:09] of Ezekiel's dry bones coming forth."
[1:14:12] But the life only come not when the
[1:14:14] sineu's skins was upon him. What is
[1:14:16] that? Its muscles and tendons begin to
[1:14:18] attach them one to other. Not when that
[1:14:21] happened, but when the wind blowed upon
[1:14:24] him. That's when come back that fourth
[1:14:27] message of life. I will restore, sayeth
[1:14:30] the Lord. Hallelujah. Glory. Praise be
[1:14:33] to God. The fourth light is come that
[1:14:36] will bring forth the same signs. Watch.
[1:14:39] He says justification brought forth
[1:14:41] forth the pulp. He says sanctification
[1:14:44] brought forth the bark. Doctrine of
[1:14:46] holiness. He says what brought forth the
[1:14:48] leaf? Pentecostals.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; What is it? Pentecostals leaves clapping
[1:14:53] their hands and JOY AND REJOICING.
[1:14:55] PENTECOST. WHAT? BUT HE says the fourth
[1:14:59] was the word itself.
[1:15:01] The word made flesh, fruits of fruits of
[1:15:05] proof of the resurrection, signs that
[1:15:08] Christ has finally after justification
[1:15:10] been planted and sanctification been
[1:15:12] planted, baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:15:14] organations died out, Christ has be
[1:15:18] center himself like that that cap of the
[1:15:21] pyramid.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; That's awesome.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; What is it the word itself is bringing
[1:15:26] forth? Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; First the bones, the rattling, the
[1:15:32] coming together, YET THERE'S NO LIFE. So
[1:15:34] you CAN JUMP AND SHOUT and you can move
[1:15:36] around, but there's still no life.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; The sineu can come and THE MUSINGS AND
[1:15:40] TENDONS COME AND IT'S A QUIET TIME, BUT
[1:15:42] yet there's no life.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; The flesh COMES AND HE COVERS you
[1:15:49] and you are a body made whole,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; but no life.
[1:15:55] You have no life unto in you until when?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Until the wind begins to blow.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; When God begins to speak his word,
[1:16:05] that's what he does. He comes AND HE
[1:16:07] BREATHES LIFE INTO YOUR NOSTRILS.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; He begins to breathe on you.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; He says in the restoration again, he
[1:16:19] says Jesus said it'll be the same thing
[1:16:22] at the coming. Oh, then the evening
[1:16:24] light of Malachi 4 come a shining
[1:16:27] through the darkness. Amen. He says to
[1:16:29] bring the evening light on the
[1:16:30] predestinated word. Hallelujah. What's
[1:16:33] the fourth message to be? What's that
[1:16:35] fourth messenger? TO SHINE THE LIGHT on
[1:16:38] the word.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EZEKIEL WASN'T
[1:16:42] POINTING THOSE BONES TO HIMSELF? HE
[1:16:44] WASN'T SAYING COME FOLLOW ME. HE WASN'T
[1:16:47] SAYING OH IF YOU COME AND DO THIS. He
[1:16:49] wasn't trying to do any of that.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:53] Amen.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; So if I'm going to follow a prophet, I'm
[1:16:57] going to follow a man that follows God.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to follow a man that speaks
[1:17:01] the word of God.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; This is the evening light has come
[1:17:10] shining through on the pred
[1:17:11] predestinated word. Yes, sir.
[1:17:16] And in verse 9, he said, "Then said unto
[1:17:19] me, prophesy under the wind. Prophesy
[1:17:22] son of man and say when thus saith the
[1:17:24] Lord God come forth the four winds oh
[1:17:27] breathe the breath upon these slain that
[1:17:30] they may live and so I prophesied as
[1:17:32] commanded and the breath came into them
[1:17:34] and they lived and stood upon their feet
[1:17:37] an exceeding great army.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what it is in an
[1:17:42] exceeding great army in a pile of bones?
[1:17:45] It doesn't look like they're an army.
[1:17:47] YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL LIKE YOU'RE AN ARMY,
[1:17:49] BUT WHAT DOES THE PROPHET SAY? THAT WHEN
[1:17:51] YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE WHO YOU ARE, IT'S
[1:17:54] NOT A TIME TO JUST WAIT. NOW'S THE DAY
[1:17:56] OF RECOGNITION. NOW'S THE TIME TO
[1:17:58] IDENTIFY I AM THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Now is the day.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; When you begin to recognize who you are.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because when you recognize who you
[1:18:17] are, you can identify yourself in the
[1:18:20] word
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; and you become an invincible army.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; The breath of God is what brings the
[1:18:36] life of God.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; We need the word to be preached without
[1:18:43] fear and without favor. Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; God is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:18:50] forever. What he did then as he's
[1:18:52] showing us through scripture, what was
[1:18:53] it in the Garden of Eden, just like Adam
[1:18:56] and Eve,
[1:18:59] the very beginning.
[1:19:05] What did God do? He took a rib. What is
[1:19:08] it? A bone
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; out of Adam's side.
[1:19:13] And he says, "Out of this rib, I'm going
[1:19:15] to form a helpmate." And brother
[1:19:18] Brandham says, "It was just under the
[1:19:20] heart." Why? Because it's close to a
[1:19:21] man.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm going to take that rib and
[1:19:25] from the dust of the earth and with his
[1:19:27] bone, I'm going to begin to form." Why?
[1:19:29] Because Eve was a byproduct of Adam. But
[1:19:31] what God did is he began to he would
[1:19:33] take it from the original CREATION AND
[1:19:35] HE WOULD SET IT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND
[1:19:37] BEGIN TO FORM.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SHE WAS A PART OF HIM.
[1:19:49] from the dust of the earth and rib of
[1:19:52] the original creation. Why? Then Adam
[1:19:55] can say she is bone of my bone. She is
[1:19:58] flesh in my flesh.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; She is me.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; She's a part of me. Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; But yet Eve laid lifeless.
[1:20:13] When she was created and formed there, I
[1:20:16] can see in the garden, she just laid
[1:20:17] lifeless
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; and God was just working and forming
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; and he put her together and he brought
[1:20:24] the bones together and the sineu and he
[1:20:27] put the flesh over her. Brother Brandham
[1:20:30] says she was the most beautiful woman.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:34] And she's laying there lifeless.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; But yet it took what?
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; The wind and the breath of God
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; to breathe the breath of life into Eve.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery. He says,
[1:20:56] "Now you see a secret.
[1:20:59] What to the fallen? to restore a fallen
[1:21:02] Eve as she was a prefigure of the
[1:21:04] church. And now notice as God opened up
[1:21:06] the sight of Adam and took Eve by his
[1:21:09] own flesh and blood and divided the
[1:21:11] spirit of masculine and feminine and
[1:21:13] feminist and put in Eve and took a rib
[1:21:16] from under his side and made Eve out of
[1:21:19] it. So God did the same thing, taking it
[1:21:22] out of the sight of of Christ,
[1:21:25] the blood and water.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the word and the and the
[1:21:30] taking the word and making it his church
[1:21:33] Eve see back to himself again redeemed
[1:21:36] by the blood that was that come from his
[1:21:39] body. You see now he said what happened
[1:21:41] in a prefigure now he opened up Adam's
[1:21:44] side and took apart his flesh which was
[1:21:46] Adam to Eve and the bride has to be the
[1:21:49] word for he is the word she cannot stand
[1:21:52] on creeds you cannot stand on
[1:21:54] denomination she cannot stand on good
[1:21:56] behavior she cannot stand she has to
[1:21:59] stand on the word alone
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; because SHE IS A PART OF IT
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; SHE WAS TAKEN from Christ
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; and in ORDER TO BE CHRIST, YOU HAVE TO
[1:22:11] BE CHRISTLIKE.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; SAYS, "LOOK, he never went and got dirt
[1:22:24] and made Eve. He made he he made from
[1:22:27] the original dirt and he took a rib from
[1:22:31] his side and made him a helpmate and
[1:22:33] that was Eve. She was made for the man
[1:22:36] and a part of the man. She was a part of
[1:22:38] him in the beginning in the creation and
[1:22:40] theophony. She was a part of him down
[1:22:43] here in this creation. She could not be
[1:22:46] divided into another creation. She had
[1:22:48] to be made in the same creation.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; She had to be made from the same dirt.
[1:22:54] She had to be made from the same
[1:22:56] particles and the things OF THE EARTH.
[1:22:58] WHY? BECAUSE SHE WAS A PART OF HIM. Just
[1:23:00] like there was TWO BY TWO ALL THROUGHOUT
[1:23:03] THAT GOD MADE MALE AND female animals,
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:08] Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And here he took Eve and he formed her.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; The same material.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; That's why I was saying in Ezekiel, he
[1:23:21] didn't go and get new dry. He didn't get
[1:23:23] no new bones. He didn't go get new dirt.
[1:23:25] What did he do? He began to gather up
[1:23:27] and revive those people, those covenant
[1:23:29] people that he already had.
[1:23:37] God never got a handful of dirt and made
[1:23:40] Eve.
[1:23:42] She had been a She would have been a
[1:23:43] different creation.
[1:23:46] She's not a creation. She's a byproduct.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; And God goes over in the heart of Adam
[1:23:51] in the rib right out under his heart and
[1:23:54] takes a rib and makes a wife in the very
[1:23:58] part of Adam's spirit in the woman. And
[1:24:00] these two are one. Soul, body, spirit,
[1:24:05] they are one. They are perfect oneness.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Oneness.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; You and Christ are one.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I can believe in that kind of oneness.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I can believe in that kind of oneness.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; That you and Christ
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; are one.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; A real woman, a real husband, a real
[1:24:28] wife, they are one together. But is it a
[1:24:32] type of Christ from out of his bosom?
[1:24:34] Not a byproduct, not a Methodist, not a
[1:24:37] Baptist, not a Pentecostal, not some
[1:24:39] kind of church, not a denomination. No.
[1:24:43] But out of his own heart, he took a
[1:24:45] sweetheart that's pure and loyal as she
[1:24:48] can be.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to identify that I'm a part
[1:24:52] of that sweetheart. I'M A PART OF HIM.
[1:24:55] I'M A PART OF HIS VERY HEART. THAT I'M
[1:24:57] GOING TO STAY LOYAL AND I'M going to
[1:24:59] stay true. AND I'M GOING TO STAY PURE
[1:25:01] AND NOT LISTEN TO ALL THESE
[1:25:03] DENOMINATIONS AND LISTEN TO MAN THAT
[1:25:05] WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT IN THE BACKSIDE OF
[1:25:06] A DESERT SOMEPLACE. NO. BUT I WANT TO
[1:25:09] STAY LOYAL AND I WANT TO STAY TRUE TO
[1:25:10] HIM.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I want to be God's helpmate
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; for this earth.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; That's what you are.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; You're God's help me.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "Honey, will you go down here?"
[1:25:28] Sure, I'll go do that. Hey honey, WILL
[1:25:30] YOU GO PRAY FOR THAT PERSON? ABSOLUTELY.
[1:25:32] I'll go pray for that person. Hey, can
[1:25:34] you go help this person? Yeah.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Ah, you're more valuable than you think.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; You're more cherished than you think.
[1:25:43] You got to change your way of thinking.
[1:25:44] You got to stop thinking YOU'RE A
[1:25:46] NOBODY. YOU GOT TO STOP THINKING THAT IT
[1:25:48] ADDS NOTHING TO IT. LET ME TELL YOU.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Come on.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; You should be in so in love with God.
[1:25:58] Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; That if there was one person going, he
[1:26:02] can say, "I'm that one."
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; That would be
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; That should be each one of our
[1:26:09] testimonies.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you didn't choose you. You
[1:26:13] probably wouldn't have chose yourself.
[1:26:15] But it wasn't up to you. It wasn't in
[1:26:17] your deciding. It wasn't any of that. It
[1:26:19] was in God's choosing that he
[1:26:21] predestinated. And he's seen you before
[1:26:23] the foundation of the world. Why?
[1:26:25] Because in the beginning was the word
[1:26:27] and the word was God. Come on, somebody.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're right.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And if you were a part of the word in
[1:26:38] the beginning, what are we going back
[1:26:40] to?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; The beginning. Back to another Eden
[1:26:46] again.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:26:54] He's given us all these promises.
[1:26:56] Musicians come.
[1:26:58] He's given us all these promises and
[1:27:00] covenants.
[1:27:05] As I begin to think of the story of
[1:27:07] Ezekiel
[1:27:09] and he would show him the prophecy of
[1:27:12] things that were to be, but yet before
[1:27:15] showing him the condition of the dry
[1:27:17] bones, but yet he asked him, "Can these
[1:27:20] bones live again?" And brother Brandham
[1:27:23] came in our day and he was going THROUGH
[1:27:25] A HARD TIME AND HE would tell his story.
[1:27:27] He was coming down from Montana and they
[1:27:30] would stop in a restaurant and he would
[1:27:32] stop there and they would eat and him
[1:27:33] and Billy and they would they would eat
[1:27:35] and he would say, "Oh, that's a real
[1:27:36] man." You know, he coughed and that's a
[1:27:38] real man.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; BUT YET HE WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD
[1:27:41] TIME.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; He says the people got in such a
[1:27:44] condition. He says, "I'm just going to
[1:27:46] start preaching to them."
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; He says, "The harder I preach, the worse
[1:27:51] they get."
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "And they got in this
[1:27:54] condition." And he's like, I just I just
[1:27:56] won't even preach to him.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; And they stopped in that restaurant and
[1:28:00] they begin to leave and Billy fell
[1:28:02] asleep and they he was driving down the
[1:28:04] road
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; and he was down in a valley.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I want you to look at
[1:28:19] those mountain rings.
[1:28:25] Give me the picture.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; He says, "How many peaks are there?"
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Said, "Seven."
[1:28:38] B R A H N.
[1:28:46] He says the first two small ones.
[1:28:50] Then he says the tall one's the
[1:28:53] first pool.
[1:28:55] Then another small one. He said the
[1:28:57] second one's the second pool. He says
[1:29:00] you're down in this one. It's going up
[1:29:03] to the third pool. And he found himself
[1:29:06] in this valley. Look at this long valley
[1:29:09] that the prophet is.
[1:29:12] But yet he said, "I want you to look at
[1:29:14] that mountaintop and that's going to be
[1:29:16] a covenant unto you."
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:20] THAT'S GOING TO BE AN EVERLASTING
[1:29:22] COVENANT.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; That I'm going to keep my promise
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to keep my word. And if
[1:29:31] you ever GET DISCOURAGED, IF YOU'RE EVER
[1:29:33] GOING THROUGH A VALLEY, IF YOU'RE EVER
[1:29:35] FIND YOURSELF AND THE PEOPLE PUT
[1:29:37] THEMSELVES in a certain condition and
[1:29:39] you might question
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; if it's worth it.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; He says, I want you to remember those
[1:29:46] mountains.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at those. Yes,
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; because that's my covenant to you in
[1:29:51] this day.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; And we are covenant people.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A SIGN THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET IN
[1:30:02] THIS DAY and in this hour.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; THAT HE BROUGHT THE FIRST AND SECOND
[1:30:07] PULL. BUT YET, that's just that's just
[1:30:09] little stuff.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; But when the third pull took effect,
[1:30:13] when the word itself comes into
[1:30:21] That's it.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Church, if the word doesn't revive us,
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing else will.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Nothing else will.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Nothing else will. If the word doesn't
[1:30:30] have an effect in your life, IF THE WORD
[1:30:32] THAT IS PREACHED AND IT GOES AND IT
[1:30:35] DOESN'T AFFECT YOUR LIFE, NOTHING else
[1:30:37] will.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing else will hold you in this hour.
[1:30:40] IT'S TOO DARK. IT'S TOO HARD. IT'S TOO
[1:30:43] DRY.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The only thing that's going to
[1:30:48] keep you is this word
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; is this message of the hour.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; And when YOU GO THROUGH A HARD TIME AND
[1:30:55] YOU GO THROUGH A VALLEY AND YOU GO
[1:30:57] THROUGH A SICKNESS,
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; hold on to his word.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Because his word is eternal.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; And if his word is eternal,
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; so are you.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; So are you.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; So it don't matter the ups and the downs
[1:31:24] and the seasons of life. IT DON'T MA
[1:31:26] MATTER ABOUT ANY OF THAT.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll be with you, even in you,
[1:31:34] until the end of the world."
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; He promised.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:43] The voice of the prophet still speaks.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; the voice of the prophet,
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; it still has an effect in our lives.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; So, if you're going through a valley,
[1:32:01] what did the prophet tell us in the
[1:32:03] scripture? Dig a ditch.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Dig a ditch.
[1:32:11] Expect the rain to come.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Because it's his word.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this together.
[1:32:27] Easy
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; when you're up on the mountain.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And you've got peace of mind
[1:32:44] like you've never known.
[1:32:49] But then things change
[1:32:52] when
[1:32:54] you're down in the valley.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Don't lose faith.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't lose faith.
[1:33:05] For you're never alone.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; He's the same God.
[1:33:10] The God of the mountain
[1:33:15] is still God in the valley
[1:33:21] when things go wrong.
[1:33:26] Oh, he'll make them right.
[1:33:31] And the God of the good time,
[1:33:37] it's still God in the light.
[1:33:40] time.
[1:33:42] The God of the day
[1:33:48] is the God in the night.
[1:33:53] And we talk of faith.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; We're up on the mountain,
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; but talk comes so easy.
[1:34:08] Isn't it easy
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; when life at
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; But it's down in the valleys.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Down in the valley
[1:34:19] of
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; of trials and temptation.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; That's where your faith
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; That's where your faith
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; is going to be put to the test.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. for the God on the
[1:34:36] mountain.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; It's the God in the valley.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; When things go wrong,
[1:34:50] he'll make the right.
[1:34:55] And the God of the good time
[1:35:00] is still God in the bad time.
[1:35:06] The God of the day
[1:35:11] is still God in the
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; for the God of the mountain.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, the God of the mountain
[1:35:21] is still God in the valley.
[1:35:26] When things go wrong,
[1:35:32] he'll he'll make them right.
[1:35:37] And the God of the good times
[1:35:42] is still God in the bad times.
[1:35:48] The God of today
[1:35:52] is still God alive.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Can you testify of that this evening?
[1:36:00] That the God of the good times is still
[1:36:02] the God of the bad times. And in the low
[1:36:05] valleys, it don't matter. He's still
[1:36:06] God.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Never changes.

[1:36:45] some meat offerings to offer.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's all right.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; If you're feeling down in the valley,
[1:36:50] just start thanking him and praising
[1:36:52] him.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Praise him before the water even comes.

[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, we can never thank you enough for
[1:37:08] Lord that
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, you seem fit to choose us. That
[1:37:13] you seem fit to call us. We feel
[1:37:15] unworthy at times, but Lord, we're so
[1:37:18] thankful that you didn't throw the clay
[1:37:20] away. That you didn't discard us, BUT
[1:37:23] LORD, YOU PICKED US UP AGAIN. WHY?
[1:37:25] Because we are a part of you.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; So God, mold us and make us into your
[1:37:31] image.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Take away things in our lives, things
[1:37:34] that are hindering us and holding us
[1:37:36] back, and let us run the race that is
[1:37:38] before us, oh God.
[1:37:42] And we're so thankful,
[1:37:45] Lord, that you're the same in our
[1:37:47] valleys and in our mountain tops. We'll
[1:37:50] still praise you
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; for Lord, you never fail us.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; And so we ask we go from this place,
[1:38:01] Lord, would you go?
[1:38:04] Lord, would you continue to unfold
[1:38:05] yourself to us? Reveal yourself to us.
[1:38:08] Lord, let us get into this message and
[1:38:10] dig into it.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; And if our ditches ARE TOO SHALLOW, LET
[1:38:14] US DIG THEM A LITTLE DEEPER. IF OUR
[1:38:15] HEALING HASN'T COME YET, JUST HOLD ON.
