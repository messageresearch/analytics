they're worshiping their God also that's right to think that you've taken and called these people before they were even born thank youus and you've called them for a purpose and they're a reflection of what you've done on the inside and then to think Lord that someday when we step to the other side I'll be glad to line up everybody's going to be 21 years old hallelujah hallelujah what a day

enough credit by the way amen amen they worship every Sunday and every Wednesday so you need to take them out for supper and show them some appreciation am I don't even hear some from musicians what do you think about that oh my CH Revelations 8 again brother Oscar and his family had a wonderful time today having the fellowship with them at the hotel down there and I sure enjoyed it specially yesterday my it's not the it's not the instrument it's the heart behind the instrument my I enjoyed that yesterday and all the specials and the choir and me and my wife just want to say a wonderful sister Sarah a wonderful thank you for your generosity and your hospitality you've been such a wonderful audience to preach to and last night when I saw the Holy Spirit move in such a unique way man I thought brother Brian shouldn't have quit I think he should have been preaching this morning boy I had two bullet hit me right over there I didn't even blink I got it twice right there so I told Brother Brian this morning but you got to remember the sniper sits Higher One shot at a time shoots further to protect the machine gun so you know we you got a two- stage you got a two stage artillery here this morning you know thank you Lord he always says I'm going to put my truck a neutral and idle for a while well I'll pull out my horse how's that I'll put my Leger on the saddle have a sandwich for a while how's that should appreciate the gift in brother Brian but you know what it's not there's so many people gifted yeah but not many men surrender their gifts like that that's the work it's not the gift that's right it's not the gift the ability to surrender that gift is amazing and I've learned so much Revelations chapter 8 this is the Harvest chapter the seed chapters in The Book of Genesis you can find absolutely everything in the Book of Revelation in the Book of Genesis so all I'm going to do is start in the Harvest chapter and we'll get to a little bit going backwards Revelations 81 and when he had remember John what he was doing is they said John write what you see so John sees a white horse and he writes a white horse and then John sees a red one and he sees the Riders change and then John sees the lion and boy he's writing writing writing writing and he gets to the end of that Sixth Seal which is your tribulation seal and then he's going to write in yeah nothing's happening and he's stunned nothing is happening but the fact that nothing's happening as brother brandom says is actually the key to the bride is actually what because when John could say there's a white horse the devil could come and say there's a white horse but he had a black man okay so once it's written it can be perverted but when he looked up at the 8 seven seal there's nothing yeah right amen how are you going to pervert nothing but the beautiful part is God knows how to call his bride and give him the transmission that the world sees nothing but the brid will see a full scale Revelation behind what the God sees nothing okay so Revelations 81 quickly when he had opened the seven seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour and he saw seven angels which stood before God and to them was given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar remember this the incense altar right before the holiest of holies that he should offered with all the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hands and the angel took the sensor fill it with fire remember that's from the brass altar cast it on the earth and this was the result voices Thunder lightnings and an earthquake amen okay just while you're standing I got your attention if you go to the seventh vial you'll see voices Thunders Lightnings earthquakes when you see Moses come down the mountain revealing the word you see voices Thunders Lightnings and earthquakes if you go to Sunset Mountain you'll hear Thunders and voices and Lightnings but one thing be missing is earthquakes yeah but a year later he goes back to the same spot throws a rock in the air and completes the scriptures amen praise the lord it's just too good you may be seated this morning God bless you uh I'd like to just speak a little bit to last night with the I asked brother Ron if I could do this and to the people that came up for prayer uh last night you know let me just say this to you like this okay sometimes what happens is we get a false impression of what the Holy Ghost is and then that produces a false expectation right okay true so the point I'm going to make is you people that came up for prayer last night and I want you to understand something you came for prayer and for help because you felt there was a need or an unfulfillment okay and that's good amen okay what I want to say to you is that's what's keeping you saved do you know why because serp and Seed can't feel the need in their life so they don't come for prayer that's right and I don't I'm I'm saying this in a certain way cuz I want you to understand the effects of the Holy Ghost okay so what's keeping you saved is that you feel unworthy you feel you need help you feel you need to come up for prayer you feel you need more now all of those things the devil will make you think see you don't have the Holy Ghost see you're condemned see you're struggling see you did something wrong but I want to tell you something that's what's keeping you saved to your that's what's keeping you humble enough if you just realize this that's what's keeping you saved and in humility knowing that there's a thirst for more of God you couldn't have that thirst unless you had the Holy Ghost you see see somebody that doesn't have the Holy Ghost they think that God had made why do I go up for prayer amen does that make sense to you very often God does things in our lives and it doesn't it feels contrary to what we think our perspective should be very often you know the fact that you feel needy you should say Lord I thank God I feel needy amen the fact that you feel you need more you should thank God you feel more that is the Holy Ghost and you're not you know sometimes people are looking for something and what they're looking for is not what the reality is the fact that you've got the need and are aware you can feel the need is the evidence that God's in you Lord hallu Cain can't feel that yeah Cain can't feel that the Holy Ghost last night was here okay God was here man there's thick like fog and Faith was just working on all of us including me okay and the rejoicing and the feeling wasn't what the Holy Ghost really was that was the effect of it but the Bible says that when he the Holy Ghost comes he's going to do three things now I want you to listen for those of you that are struggling and thinking why am I don't have the Holy Ghost the Bible says the Holy Ghost can te things listen number one lead and guide you into all truth did he take us into truth last night amen amen number two bring things to your remembrance right you already knew I already knew what brother Brian was preaching about yesterday before the foundations of the world but when I came in my human flesh I forgot that when he started preaching it all came back to me it's called everybody listening yes it's called Remember yes amen hallelujah does that make sense yeah it's called re remember that means you knew it once and then in your flesh you couldn't contact it and now the Holy Ghost came to let us REM and what happened was was we recognized we recognized we knew Christ before we came here but now he came back and we recognize what we already forgot we knew that's right does that make sense to you see the Holy Ghost when he comes to lead and guide you into all truth check the mark the Holy Ghost will take and bring things to your remembrance amen is that right he'll bring things to your remembrance and then the Holy Ghost when he comes will show you things to come okay there's your measurement amen you don't have to feel something when the Lord opened the scriptures last night didn't he give us a type of what we're expecting to come didn't he lead and guide us in draw truth didn't he bring things back to our memory we were blessed last night see what I mean it's called restore restore hallelujah amen redeem right amen remember amen am that's what the word does all right now there's another thing that I'd like to address a little bit and that is this let's say brother Oscar went to his mailbox and he found out there's a $10 million check written in Oscar's mailbox written to our brother Oscar we'd hear it all the way to Manitoba amen right brother Oscar okay now the point I'm making is a problem okay so brother Oscar Landing a million bucks in his mailbox is an event right amen I'd say it's a good one I'd say he deserves it he would have a golden sacks next time okay but what do we call a problem it's also an event right yeah okay the thing with the problem is it's an event with pain in it right okay now when brother Oscar has a million bucks in his in his uh mailbox he says buddy I'm paying free paying my house off I'm going to take and pay my machine off and we're going on holidays there's no pain in that the point I'm making is when we have what we call a problem is also an event and the difference between that event and what we call a problem is the pain in the event because we're pain avoiders we don't like pain okay it's the pain in the event that we want to avoid that's why we call it a problem okay what I'm telling you is God literally purposely puts problems and challenges is right in front of you that you have to face yes sir okay God does that he put things in front of you with pain in it that you have to face your flesh naturally wants to run away from the pain but to you that are facing problems let me tell you a hint okay enjoy the pain it's good stuff amen don't waste the pain very good don't waste the pain don't become a pain and voider don't get more religious don't lie to yourself don't try to avoid it don't downplay it let me give you a a hint as a a man that's made too many mistakes stakes and I got too many scars you need to learn to enjoy the pain it's good pain yes why it causes you to ask for truer answers number two it actually creates courage to do things you've never done before that's right the problem creates courage you need if God what do we do when we have a grade four student would put grade five problems in front of it right why you want them to grow up amen what happens when they're in grade five grade six and you struggle a year to overcome grade six what is causing you to grow spiritually you it's God literally challenging you to ask for better answer and enjoy the pain because Christ went to Calvary willingly to enjoy the pain so you and I could live okay does that make sense point I'm making is that for those some of you you don't think you have the Holy Ghost and need more of the Hol Holy Ghost let me say something to you the fact that there's that need in you is the EV Ence that you have the Holy Ghost already cuz you couldn't have that thirst if God wasn't in there amen so don't let the devil beat you up and say I'm condemned you're not condemned you're growing you're not condemned you're growing God hasn't thrown you away he sees you you know what I mean he sees you evil you want to write this down you can write this down evil always destroys the evidence that they're in need of spiritual growth why did Cain kill Abel cuz Abel was the evidence of what Cain was lacking does that make sense why did Pina Throw Dirt at Hannah yeah cuz Hannah had the worthy portion and Pina was throwing dirt at Hannah because Hannah was the evidence of what Pina laed amen okay evil always destroys the evidence that they are in need of spiritual growth okay so don't be surprised when some of your friends leave you what you call friends does that all make sense you only understood I want the people that came for prayer last night to Have Courage that was the evidence that God is with you the fact that you came for prayer Lord so the Holy Ghost when he comes you'll do three things I trust he comes today he'll do three things what will he do lead and guide you into all truth what the second thing he's going to do bring things to your remembrance what's the third thing he's going to do show you things to come amen trust that was okay I'd like to continue today on the evidence or the way of a true pastor and uh I really appreciated the conversation we had in the hotel room today and I got some texts today or last night and the whole thing all boils down to is the idea that pastorial ship to to be a good pastor and I had learned this kind of the hard way is Christ is the chief Pastor yeah underneath that is a pastor for the age that has to line the pastor for the age one time was going to go hunting and fishing and go to Alaska and then God put him right back in line one time and he told him the price he was going to pay if he wasn't going to get in line amen I sorry I should do it like this right Chief Shepherd the pastor for the age and one time brother Brandon said this is too hard I'm not going to do this the sacrifice is too much and he was going to go to the bush and said God when you need me call me and then I'll come back and God says boy you're going to he gave him he said listen you know that you know that old guy down there you'll be spitting Cod and your wife is going to leave you to get him back in line right okay you understand right so under that we have pastors to the church and under this we've got uh the the pastor uh of the family which is the father and under this we've got the the wife brother says the woman the the mother is also a pastor and under that we've got the children so the point of making is pastorial ship starts all the way from the top and goes all the way to the bottom okay so my point is is that if you're going to if you're uh you know I I brother Ron is the pastor here and I can tell what kind of brother uh Pastor brother Ron is by the evidence of how you treat Christ and it's the same thing with you and your family I'm a father and if you want to look how I've pastored look at my children all right it's the same thing amen and so the point I'm trying to make is we're all responsible for all staying in that now listen we can't always get the results we want and I get that because listen when me and brother Ron were teenag we'd never even had a dad in our life period you know and the dad we had knew nothing about Redemption I mean zero now some of you kids been raised on message Pew and I just going to tell you this and you won't understand this but you don't know how lucky you are you know you I I know you don't understand that but the point of it is I'll tell you anyway when brother Ron and I were kids we never had a dad that cared for our soul that's right we had to learn that from our heavenly father when we quit looking at our Earthly father and turned her eyes to the heavenly father and that's what Isaiah had to do Isaiah was looking at the king and he was so respecting the king but he was taking getting influence on a horizontal horizontal level and then God had to break that thing and God caused that King to fall and then Isaiah had to look up and now he's all the real King hallu action reverence humility in how they behave in the house of God because his Earthly King had denied the house of God so sometimes you got to get your eyes off of your Earthly father and get it back to the heavenly father so you can be in line for Redemption okay you know some of you you were like me and brother Ron and many others we never had a dad that adopted us and the fact of it is they couldn't they they they're their their their spiritual bank accounts were empty they had nothing to give us you know you know what I mean that way because you have to be willing able Kinsmen right and they couldn't so we got a real adoption when we start one time I had a youth camp and I and I gave all I had about nine young men in the front row and I gave them a pen and paper said I want you to describe God to me so I gave me a pen and a paper and they started writing God is this God is that God is that and I gave and I took all their papers back and started reading it I had nine different gods amen wow yeah they're all describing their dad so the inspiration of our pastorial ship comes through adoption to our Heavenly Father that's all I'm going to say okay so if we go a little bit further without getting into too many details and this is where I get all messed up because after he preached yesterday I was really messed up but I'd like to take the thought of the seven seal yeah effect and the opportunity and the gap of that seven seal because I want to go to the Book of Esther and I want to speak about moving because remember Esther moved from Moab all the way to the field and then on the way she had a was introduced to the chief Reaper and then finally to boas so she went through four stages Point number two I want to make is this that it was Naomi that could bring her to the first three and bring her right to Boaz but Naomi did not take no Authority once she hit the thrashing floor at Boaz cuz she said Naomi said when you get to the threshing floor She said now you do what he says yeah she knew her parenting was done if I can use that word okay but Naomi's mission in life was to get Ruth to that threshing floor so that her job could be finished and I know brother Ron and I know me my job and Ron's job is get you to Christ then finally we can rest amen these preachers that want to develop dependency on the preachers they're fools oh yes I ain't got enough energy for that I'm way too tired for that let me say it like this Naomi genuinely loved Ruth and was concerned about her spiritual growth to hand her off okay Naomi was not an insecure person Naomi didn't need Ruth depending on her just to make Naomi feel good now I'm going to use some words but and you'll understand Naomi was Ruth's first pastor but the job of the first pastor pastors get you to the second Pastor that's right you parents are your kids's first pastor but your job is to get your kids to the second Pastor which is Christ very good you understand yes amen there's two classes of oil in Luke 20 Matthew 25 everybody when they heard the bridegroom oh boy see I don't want to preach I just come everybody heard the bridegroom call under the seventh dispensation everybody rolls up whoa the bridegroom's coming yeah yeah but there's two classes of oil true the first class of oil runs out yeah it's only the second class of oil that brings you to your groom Hallelujah does that make sense you understand everybody said whoa God sent a prophet whoa but eventually that runs out that should lead you to the second oil the Holy Ghost is what that should do see amen and so we find out that true pastoral ship is not creating a dependency like Naomi didn't create a dependency where she said Ruth you depend on me right boy brother osar now we're back at that topic you and I talked about a dependency can look like love but it's as evil as the day is long that's right Ruth was not an insecure person she didn't need to be fed to somebody to feed the insecurity yeah does that make sense you understand now Ruth was secure enough to be concerned about Ruth's uh Naomi was secure enough to be concerned about Ruth's spiritual growth and at a certain spot Naomi knew she had to take her hands off she was not an insecure person to create a dependency and I'll tell you something else I've learned people that think that dependency is is Love Actually if you look at it a dependency is very evil because a dependence Y is when you have one person that's spiritually sick and they find another person it's amazing how they find each others another person that's spiritually sick and then this person feeds that spiritual sickness and this person feeds that one and boy there's a strong bond together you ever get between those people they'll bite your head off because they think that you're destroying something the point I'm making if it's God's love God's depended on spiritual growth because if you love somebody you want them to grow spiritually without you man I wish I could somehow I don't want to get down down that role but if I could get you so often you have people or families or churches you have an insecure Pastor behind let's do the church level you can I don't care you can go any level you want the point is you can have an insecure pastor and he has an insecurity inside of him and he's looking to see if the congregation is insecure enough that they that they'll are dependent on him well he's dependent on them they're dependent on him and they love each others and they'll do stuff for each others and they'll work for each others and my goodness looks so tight the whole thing is evil the whole thing is evil because what the pastor is saying is I'm going to keep you spiritually sick so I can stay spiritually sick so we can can look like a church agapy love is based on spiritual growth not a dependency the last thing I want is my church people to be depending on me the last thing I want and if I hang on to them and create insecurities and remind them how they need me and how they failure and they need me and you can't go to heaven without me I'm as evil as the you can quote scriptures and quote message and still be flat out evil but Naomi she had no insecurities she pulled Ruth out of the world brought her into boaz's field ah let me idle there a little bit Naomi didn't have to re-register the field yes amen the field was was already good you know what I mean that way yeah because before Naomi brought Ruth to the field what they don't know is the chief Shepherd before the first Harvester got there Boaz already went into the field and he grabbed that barley and he was going like this and checking to see if it was right Boaz already registered the field we don't have to re-register the message man good night do you see what I mean boad has already been here this is his field this is certified seed and Naomi doesn't go and check to see if the field is good for Ruth to come into are you kidding you're going to go and register this message are you kidding to me that'd be like the little that little that little lamb trying to protect the lion can you imagine give me a break the lion don't need protecting that's good what I'm trying to say is I don't need to defend this message oh Lord boy boy don't don't do this to me praise the Lord I don't have to defend this message it defends [Music] me I don't have to re-register the seed you know what brother BR said you know what what Eve's fall was one place brother says Eve fell because she wanted to protect the truth I got a question yeah I got a question for you right I have thought in my younger years I'm the defender of the faith and I'm going to protect this message that was Cockiness that's what that was you know what's wrong with sending this message I'll tell you what's wrong with it it's not what you're doing it's your position here's the message right if you say you're going to protect this message you've placed yourself above it are you kidding me right we're supposed to be under it not above it who do you think you are it's not what you're doing it's not your intention but it's your position that putting yourself into so Boaz Naomi knows enough about scripture that she knows cuz remember Naomi has has the right bloodline in her but she needs also a place for a woman to be able to for the inheritance okay now let me boy see you get to these topics okay they didn't have Richie Brothers in the those days there was no Richie Brothers what I'm saying is this day and age a farmer Farms all his life and then after that he sells his machinery and then he takes all his machinery and puts it for auction on Richie Brothers but in those days the farm never went to Richie Brothers it went to your oldest son inheritance got it you never got out of your inheritance you passed along to your son that's why you want to make sure your son was a v married a virgin because she's going to be part of your inheritance boy now I could go to Deuteronomy 22 but the point I'm making is God has an interest in your condition cuz you're going to be have the benefit of be carrying on The Inheritance am that's why God's concerned about what you think concerned about what you believe concerned about what church you go through he's trying to keep you a virgin pure to the word because you're going to be the beneficiary of eternal life this is not about you oh by the way this is not about you this is about him that's why he's keeping you cleanall it ain't about you it's about him but you and I have the privilege for us Amen to be part of his inheritance when we were born by sex amen when we we were born we're all disqualified for inheritance but praise the Lord you can be born out of your sex birth and come to a spoken word birth reborn not by sex by the spoken word sir you can go to church but what are you doing about your sex birth you can play specials what are you doing about your sex birth you can take and dress right what are you doing about your sex birth I'll tell you something we need somebody that wasn't born by sex to reach down and grab a sex born man and haul him up we need Christ The Inheritance what Adam lost marriage is not a right is it's a privilege yes sir amen definitely I don't want to go down too many rabbit Trails cuz I know where I want to get to hopefully I'm in slide number two out of 15 God marriage is a privilege of redemption it's like your driver's license you think your driver's license are right no you go ahead and speed too many many times and you'll find out it's not your driver's license your driver's license is a privilege right and your driver's license to Heaven is a privilege also you say this is all about me I got news for you this is all about what God put in you not you that's right so Naomi wasn't insecure yeah she could easily tell Ruth listen when you get to that threshing floor watch her comeand she says now from here on in you do what he says good so the way of a true pastor pastoring is not dependency pastoring is the ability to let go and give God and Boaz because Naomi knew she was a Jew she knew the cycles and the traditions of redemption and and land title rights and all that now oh boy you know what this is just too much but let me just say it like this okay now Naomi knew she was looking for a time when boas would be in transition and she knew that that would be boaz's weak spot is when he would be in transition because remember brother brandom says and it's so beautiful Jesus Christ left his father's Throne to move to his own throne but we know that he didn't want to go to his own Throne wife right so there is right in that transition when there's opportunity so the point I'm making is is that Boaz was in transition and when she saw Boaz go from the field and then head off to the Garner something inside of her said it's harvest time yeah we've got opportunity here and I find this so fascinating I find this so fascinating because uh because uh Naomi she knew that there would have to be a a transition from the feet to the side yeah amen Naomi didn't tell oh you know I don't know you know what I mean I don't know Naomi knew enough to know that the way to to boaz's side was through his feet and for those of you that don't take foot washing you should listen the way Adam took his wife out of his side right the wife is by the husband's side yeah right but the way to the side is through the feet yes the way to the incense altar where the seventh seal takes place is through the brass altar you have to go to the Brass altar first and recognize your worthlessness and recognize you need him that has to happen at the brass altar understand because the same fire there's a Divine link between the brass Altar and the incense altar because the fire on the incense altar actually came from the brass altar so they had and the fire the fire on the brass altar came from God so God took and LIF the brass altar that same fire got translated all the way to the incense altar amen got it now and you can't be a priest and offering at the incense altar unless you come through the brass altar what I'm trying to say is that that say there's a link between Jesus Christ blood 2,000 years ago at the brass altar all the way to the incense altar when Revelations opened up the same blood that was there 2,000 years ago came in our generation one more time because there's a Divine link between Calvary and what happened in our generation but you can't get to our generation till you understand what the brass altar represents for you beautiful and another thing when you get at boaz's feet no the feet are here here's boaz's feet here's boaz's side he's laying all across this stage here's Calvary Hallelujah over here is Revelations 8 the same thing that open Calvary open up Revelations 8 you can't get to Revelations 8 unless you understand what happened at Calvary that you are Justified not by what you do but what his blood justifies you and part of the same fire that was at the brass altar is the same fire they used when all the prayers of the saints were collected but not Boaz was in transition coming off the field and now he's going to be the reaper the same one that slded the seed is the same one that does the reaping right so the same one that SS the field in his field let it grow up and certified his field and he's the same one that does the reaping amen and Ruth had the privilege of being part of this process undeservedly now think of it think of it once he gets to the threshing floor and then Ruth lands and Nomo boy thank God for Naomi amen do you know that the way you treat your first Pastor the way you're going to treat your second one true girls your relations with your dad yeah 90% will be the same relationship with you have your husband your dad was your first pastor and your husband's your second pastor and there's more than once that I've been marriage counseling and I said I need you first to go make it right with your dad because if you don't make it right with your dad you're going to bring the same thing into your marriage do you know the way you treat be brother Ron is probably how you treat Christ you disrespect his office yeah you may not like him but don't disrespect his office cuz that is what'll carry you to Christ amen very good does that make sense you understand the principles now amen that's right okay I told my church they don't have to like me but they all have to ride horses cuz in Revelation 19 you got to ride horses so you need me anyways but you may not like me but you're going to take riding lessons from me that you are going to do that's scriptural I told him they you know I told them look if you get to Revelations 19 fall off your horse don't blame me but when Boaz starts to transition from the seven Church ages and now he's stepping on the threshing floor that represents opportunity for the woman and so the point I want to make is that there's a threshing floor exchange and I'm going to end up with this because it's taking too long but there's a pattern that needs to follow after the chief Shepherd and you'll find that in Scriptures it says and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also may be Sanctified but listen listen for their sakes I sanctify myself that they may also Sanctified but let's watch the next word through the truth it's the truth that sanctifies you not Eugene Brown and not Ron Peterson it's the truth that sanctifies you but the other side is also true that as a father I have to make a sacrifice so that my kids can be Sanctified through the truth amen amen as a father because only a father can bring a girl to Womanhood and only a father can bring a boy to manhood and if there's anything we're lacking in our generation we lack men and the women are strong because the men are weak if the men were strong we'd have strong women for the right reason supporting their husband but the reason sometimes you have houses where the woman is expected to be the spiritual leader is because she can't find something to respect in that man and the man is dependent on the woman for completion the man should depend on Christ for completion not the woman we went through that yesterday you understand and why would a woman trust a man when the woman can control the man he's not worth trusting gen boy Ron I don't know how far take this now you know what these churches that try to control their Pastor that man's not worth following if he falls for that do you understand a woman is looking for somebody stronger than her not for somebody she can control right she doesn't want the leadership yeah she's born to want to have a ruler born to want to have a head born to want to have somebody she can trust born to have some she can admire that came from the fall the last thing she wants is a husband that she can control d amen but if the man is going to a woman to find manhood he's in trouble because a woman can't bring a boy to manhood only the heavenly father can do that this principle applies all the way down the line because the authority fig is responsible for the relationship to the subjective figure and Christ is responsible for the relationship to the bride The Messengers responsible to the relationship for the age the pastors responsible for the relationship to the church the parents are responsible to the relationship to the to the children and it all comes down to one verse and behold the third I come to you ready to come and I'll not be burdensome to you for I come not to for to seek yours but but I come for you amen amen watch the children ought not to lay up for the parents the parents should lay up for the children brother amen so I'm talking about the way of a true Shepherd and I want to just put this in you know the Bible says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two edged sword piercing even dividing a sun of the soul and the spirit and of the joint of the marrow and the discerner of the thoughts and the inent and the intense of the heart let me just say this when you read your Bible I got news for you when you read your Bible and you think oh look at this look at this look at this and then you do this look at this look I got new for you you think you're Discerning the Bible the truth of it is this Bible is Discerning you this Bible is Discerning you amen because this is a discerner makes sense so the point I'm making is this that there's a movement where when the brother bam says when the lamb came to be slay it came forth to do what to make his claims of redemption oh my I don't just feel like going over in a corner and sitting down crying a while here comes the lamb still bloody and John there wasn't nothing there all the celebrity was standing around but there was nothing that could do it there was no lamb now his intercessory days uh his intercessory days uh are over the mediation days and that's when the Angels going to stand there you wait till we get to the seals and at that time will'll be no more that's right there's a half hour silence watch what takes place in the half hour silence when that seven seal next Sunday Lord willing what I'm trying to say to you is when the day came that Bo as his intercession days were over and now Bo is changing position to come and claim what he had sown what's the use oh boy boy what's the use of Swing something if you don't go claim it so he's the one that sold he's the one that claims what brother man says Revelations 5 the most Sublime act in all of scripture now you would think it was Calvary Calvary was great something was sewing but what's the use of sewing and paying for something if you're not going to go and claim it this is mine what do you think happen in this generation he's claiming you cuz you're his he paid for you 2,000 years ago but what good is that is looking back there when you purchased and missing when he's coming today to say You're Mine you're mine you're mine you're mine I'm calling your name your name and what brother Brian did such a beautiful job yesterday how does God call your name he takes the Bible he opens a mystery you see the mystery that is the calling of your nameall the Lord you know why you could be called because you've been sewing if you're not here here in your name today that is the evidence you never were sewing amen I was think thinking yesterday brother Brian is preaching and he's going along all of that and stuff and he's got this in this hand and this in this hand and he's going out there like an African you [Applause] know and I'm thinking yesterday I didn't I didn't hear e e you yeah I never heard that yesterday you never heard yesterday you did e e that's what I heard yesterday loud and clear Glory from an African I don't have the time here it's 12:36 come on Naomi was the first Pastor that leads to the second Pastor yeah you can't teach somebody you can't gain respect from first so do I people that don't can't respect you are unteachable correct you can't teach somebody until you can gain respect first why is Ephesians 5 so beautiful Ephesians 5 remember what I told yesterday a marriage is not man or woman living in a house blah blah blah a marriage is a mystery of Redemption an active ingredient that must be in your marriage yeah right so the mystery of redemption is got to be an active ingredient in your redemption in other words the husband has to redeem the wife so that the children can be clean right I don't want to get into that but there's a whole thing to that but if you go to the last verse the Bible says and husbands you know I was listening to you I I I listened to my church this morning and you can just see it the Bible says husbands love your wives then the Bible says and wives respect your husband and I love that mystery because you know for a husband to love his wife is not natural we would rather respect her than love her gu that's our language and a wife is not natural for her to respect her husband she would rather love her husband cuz that's her love language right now I'm getting mhm I listen to my church this morning typical woman right I love you Lord you're wonderful I love you Lord you're amazing I never heard nobody say I respect you God it's our language yeah and that's it's okay yeah I hope you're getting this yeah yeah but what's the use of trying to love your husband if you disrespect him and won't take communion won't pay tithe won't wash feet your love is zero if you don't have respect first amen make sense it's written right in Ephesians 5 I think God deserves some respect and honor that's what I I think that's what I think respect is the foundation of all teaching and Naomi earned Ruth's respect yeah for Ruth to be able to learn from Naomi say that again Naomi earned Ruth's respect for Naomi to be able to learn or Ruth to be able to learn anything from Naomi makes sense you understand that's what's wrong with our school system these days they're supposed to teach kids they got no respect and honor how you going to teach them anything when as soon as they complain they run home to the parents and the teacher gets sued yeah are you kidding me that whole generation of Devil's coming up that's what's Ruth was humble enough to follow instructions yes think about it humble enough amen Ruth was humble enough to follow instructions I'm G to say it again Ruth was humble enough to follow instructions do you know when the angel came to Sam Samson's mom the angel came with specific instructions how to raise that child that's right that's right got it right do you know that when you got children you you better not raise them your way because God a specific instruction for you how to raise your child God it don't we got no right to raise children our way I don't care if you're a minite or what tribe you come from or what color of skin or who you are if you're serving God you have no right to treat your children your way amen you know why we've been angel visited who was it that gave instructions to Samson's Mom an angel have we been angels visited did that angel tell us the parameters to treat our children humility defeat is the entrance to power brother Ben says I've served God for 45 years I know a little bit about the gate at which to enter in at humble thyself yeah Ruth's attitude to Naomi was going to be her attitude toward Boaz children your attitude toward Mom and Dad will be your attitude toward Christ Church your attitude toward brother Ron's office will be your attitude toward Christ amen your attitude toward brother Brandon true amazing my ADD attitude toward the angel will be my attitude toward god well man I'll just take these messages and use them for my convenience you know what you've just done who are you to take an angel's message and use them for your own personal convenience right she wasn't accepted the fault was going to be a Naomi cuz she was the strong angel calling for Redemption now turn with me to Esther our Book of Ruth and I'm going to close cuz we're I smell what was happening back [Music] there remember when he the Holy Ghost comes what's he going to do three things number one lead and guide you into all truth number two bring things back to your remembrance number three show you things that God's got in store for you amen right now the Book of Ruth first of all I want you to understand how God scripturally place has a mystery in the placing of the book yeah okay forget about the book Now watch how God placed the Book of Ruth yeah CU remember if you go to Judges chapter 21 in the last verse in those days there was no no king in Israel every man did what that was right in his own eyes now go to the chapter 1 verse one came to pass in the last in the days of the judges ruled that there was famine in the land so what I want you to understand was the Book of Ruth becomes the mystery in the famine at the end of the judges yes sir but I want you to notice this that it starts off in the days of Moses cuz Moses brought them all the way to the river yeah hallu the Moses dispensation had ended yeah what's the first thing that Joshua did when he crossed the river he had an angel visit yeah but what's the first thing he did he opened up the Seven Seals and seven Church ages because when he went around uh the city seven times and then and so forth you know that was the type of the seven opening of those Seven Seals and seven Church ages to do do what to release a Rahab amen all right now we're in 63 in March if you want to do a timeline yeah what are the Seals going to do they're going to release aab oh boy now we're going to get into something and Al brother he did such a good job yesterday but let me add something you know what happened was it had to release a Rahab so if they would the seals the opening of those seals released a Rahab because the token and so forth but it want you to notice something that wasn't the end of Rahab at the end of the day Rahab was predestinated to be in the lineage of redemption but it gets better than that she had had so many husbands and so many uh Witnesses of what her lifestyle was so God decided to fix this thing so he destroyed all the witnesses and when somebody tried to say RAB you can't marry salmone he asked where's your Witnesses they in ashes and all the witnesses of your formal life will be in ashes one day and you'll have no Witnesses against your marriage to the [Applause] lamb do you understand when they brought that woman in adultery had she committed adultery yeah but she came to the seven seal yeah oh don't get me started here we go again and she okay the woman is under the six come [Applause] on the seventh seal is revealed under the six seal yes the six seal is your tribulation seal for those of you that came to the altar you listen the six seal is your tribulation seal right got it the seventh seal is revealed under the six seal Christ will reveal himself in the middle of your worst days if I can say it that way amen does that make sense to you so here in the seven seal brother brandom he comes up and paragraph 261 he says I see a better stop right here cuz he's getting close to where he's going to leave ink on paper and he can't afford to do that because if he leaves ink on paper it can be perverted so paragraph 261 said brother man says I got to stop right here then he goes into Parables then he goes to paragraph 300 and then he said the seven seal open in a three-fold manner One open today one open open yesterday and one I couldn't make it out is going to it it's going to come to pass in other words and you know the description of it but watch what he said oneir open today oneir open yesterday well what happened yesterday he opened the six seal yeah that's right brother now I'm African when brother brand gets to the six seal he says I looked and I looked and oh my goodness I blew I said I had to walk around I went outside for a walk I couldn't believe what I just saw and I just ran into something I couldn't believe it this six seals amazing what does brother bandam do in the six seal he goes to Matthew 24 and opens up the seven seal in word form amen you say Eugene that's crazy no it ain't the Mana fell in day number one you ate Mana number one that's exactly what Mana fell on Tuesday you ate mana on Tuesday yeah but on Saturday you had to get the seventh day portion in the sixth day amen that's right amen double portion come on brother the seventh seal opens under the Sixth Seal the first four trumpets are environmental true Jacob cattle were dying no grass no water dust storms what's the under the six seal yeah but while Jacob was suffering under the first four trumpets he had no idea his son was going to be revealed while he was under the six seal can I show you the sick no it's too much time go ahead look at the seventh seal in Daniel chapter 2 oh yeah do you know that the Bible starts with the seven seal yeah the Bible starts with the seventh seal that's right brother Genesis 1:1 oh yeah the end result Boy The Prophet's amazing e notice he says between Genesis one one one two there's millions of years or whatever he says there there's a there's a breach there then he says when Genesis 1:2 opens it's the result of a collapsed civilization yeah you said and it's under the six seal it has no form yeah has no void and it's all Darkness the word form and void is also has no purpose has no meaning in life and darkness is all over your heart does that sound familiar what shape were you in when God found you you were without form you were without void and there was Darkness all of your life you've already experienced the seven seal and didn't know it because the next verse says and God saw boom spoke boom moved spoom and said let there be light and the light God put in you separated the light from the darkness right inside of you that is a seven seal when God moves and speaks and creates light you get the beneficiary faction of coming out of an earth without form and void and no purpose praise the Lord [Applause] hallelujah Seven Seals open when they took the city Down released out of Jericho a Rahab yeah oh Here We Go Again marriage is not man how do I say this marriage is not a he an Earthly institution start off with that okay let's start off with that you don't have to marry Angels you don't have to marry animals they never fell you need a married ceremony to sanctify your union but the animals don't marriage is an Heavenly institution not something man drummed up here okay Point number two marriage is the only institution that can bring you back to innocence not forgiveness innocence right marriage is the only institution that can bring you back to innocence when God married Rahab to the Captain yeah he was bringing her back to complete it's not that you did it yeah it's as though you never did it in the first place because there was no Witnesses she was back to innocence no matter what your life is all about okay Abigail yes she was the beneficiary of an arranged marriage true her mom and dad said you're going to meet Mary this man and blah blah blah blah blah when she saw and recognize not David but what was in David there's a king in David when she came up the hill and she came with all those gifts and remember David he came came with a sword and an army he was coming under the sick seal I'm going to kill everything that lives y boy I hope you get this David was the destroying Angel that's right brother these people were going to experience a sick seal for real but under that six seal with the angel coming with a sword Here Comes Abigail with her gifts and I can just about see it David is coming over the hill armies knives and stuff cuz he's expecting Nebo to send his army so he's trained his man he's got blood ready he's got the ambulance ready he's got bandages ready cuz he's coming out for full out War he comes over the hill and guess what what what yes and there was a woman coming to what was in David knowing he's going to need progyny Glory I like that and she's coming up and I can about I like this it says and and then David comes to the hill and everyone and for half an hour it was was dead silence boys put your swords away you won't believe this and here's Abigail coming under the Seal of Destruction coming right to the face of the Destroyer yeah and she's not asking for forgiveness notice she says listen any fault of my husband's watch the mediator office oh oh Lord you parents should take note any fault that my husband had if we've hurt you in any way those servants and I want to take all the blame how are you going to kill somebody that's a mediator amen amen and for half an hour David had to figure this thing out and he can't believe that he just got took down to his knees she came up to David and said listen David I know you're going to be king she believed Samuel's prophecy I know you're going to be king and I know I want to take care of your reputation listen David if you go kill all those people you're going to have a bad stain on your name let me save you some trouble I want to save your reputation keep it clean and I want to take all the responsibility of I want to be the mediator and I want to take and honor what God has put in you and if there's anything I can do let me know how are you going to kill that what she was doing was asking for innocence how David you're going to need a wife cuz only marriage can bring you to innocence she wasn't ask asking for forgiveness boy I hope you God is coming for a bride amen he can turn you back to complete innocence as though you never ever did it in the first place amen Naomi let okay so now the Seven Seals opened rahab's released but since the seals open every man did what was right in his own eyes and every preacher preached the way he wanted to build any church the way they wanted to and everybody did what was right in their own eyes but there's coming a day under that there's a mystery bride coming that's why you'll find over here in the first verse under the days of the judges what was happening under the judges churches were doing whatever they wanted to do because it felt good and there were just no restrictions at all but underneath that there's a mystery bride going to take and pick her place and you'll find out that after the Book of Ruth is 1 and 2 Samuel 1 and 2 Samuel is going to be do two prophets in Revelations 11 one time so all the way back from the opening of the seals all the way to Revelations 11 right in between that there's a bride type coming for Redemption and [Music] restoration and now turn with me to Ruth uh Esther chapter 3 Naomi was ready to take all the fault if this didn't work if there was going to be anything improper in it yeah the fault would lay upon Naomi do you realized that brother brandham he recognized I the first God came the first pole was filled second pole was filled and now the angel had come in in February 28th brother Brandon knew all I I just love the way brother B says it he's in Revelations 4 and he says oh here's the book it needs to be taken and then he says oh maybe I'm just feeling this way if he doesn't come let him forever hold his peace cuz brother brandom is ready to take the fault if God doesn't come and open those seals Naomi is ready to Bear the burden because all of the church is depending on Naomi's instruction what pressure brother Brandon was under yeah cuz he was the strong Angel calling for him to come and redeem you and me amen verse chapter 2 verse 21 and Ruth the moabit said unto me also Thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my Harvest and Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz and gleaned to the end of the barley and the wheat Harvest and dwelt with her motherinlaw watch Naomi said verse one that Naomi her motherin-law said unto her my daughter I seek rest for thee yes sir watch she'd been married before her first husband was dead and here's Naomi seeking rest for her because young people when they're not married they're Restless yeah they can't find their matate they're moving up and down they don't feel fulfilled that's not a bad thing Brothers I say that's a good thing that you're feeling rest less because the point of it is you're looking for rest and the rest you're looking for is finally when your mystery inside of you can be completed when you find your wife and you girls you're Restless until you can find your husband because there's a mystery of redemption inside of you do you know what I mean and Naomi saying listen I want to find you rest that's what Naomi saying and brother bam says I want to find you rest that's him over there because you would have not recognized Boaz if the chief Reaper hadn't appointed that out that's your husband up there what's brother Brandon doing trying to seek rest for you so you can be married to your husband Christ thank you Lord brother Ron and I know nothing about those Restless years they we're good but boy we're sure we're looking for rest and Naomi says I want to find a rest for thee that it would be well with thee amen I as a pastor I want to find rest for my church so that it'll be well with them I want to get them to their husband Christ cuz I'm their first Pastor Naomi but I'm an insecure man if I take my church and create a dependence on me because I want my church to find rest to marry Christ I don't want them to be depending on me that's right verse two and now is not boas our Kinsman whose with whose maidens thou was and I don't want to get into Deuteronomy 25 and behold he went with barley and Knight in the threshing floor I want you to notice something Naomi knows how to get Ruth presented yeah wash yourself anoint yourself get some oil on you get the Holy Ghost on you put thy reignment upon the don't take your clothes off put clothes on amen down get thee down to the floor four things and make not thyself known unto man until he have done eating and drinking and it shall be that when he lith down that thou shalt Mark the place where he lie yeah and thou shalt go in and push his buttons and say am I worthy go in don't nag him yeah go in lay down at his feet the feet of brass eyes of fire voice of Living Waters hair white as will you're right in Revelations 1:18 lay down at his brass feet cuz he will tell you what is to come amen there's a Redemption mystery happening in silence behind closed doors Naomi what in the world are you doing this is ridiculous you're going to tell that woman to act like somebody that you don't want to be related to without even dating him and find out what he likes this is not about the seventh seal is not about dating the seven felds asking a question do you want to be a wife or don't you can you imagine the chance she was taking taking this girl sending him into the guy's bedroom and telling her to take the covers off and then wait there till he gives you further instructions and if it goes wrong she says take it on me I'll take the blame now Nomi looks at Ruth looks at Nomi says man this Naomi knows something I don't know this strong Angel's been connected to Boaz which I don't know nothing about all I know one thing is this obedience is better than sacrifice oh church church obedience is better than sacrifice do you know why if you have to make a sacrifice that means you're atoning for something you did wrong but if you wouldn't do nothing you don't need a sacrifice obedience hey obedience is better than sacrifice cuz if you obey there's no necessity for a sacrifice Hallelujah can you imagine the audacity and the courage of Naomi how sure she was if he don't come ah if he don't come let him forever hold his peace that strong Angel call and here Naomi don't need a sacrifice there's a whole preaching sermon in that oh yeah she obee oh it shall be when he layth down that thou shall Mark the place where he lay and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet yeah and lay down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do when you approach Boaz you go to the Brass altar first listen to me everybody listening and you wait there you wait this is By Invitation Only John was invited to come up a little higher yes amen Elijah was invited to come in The Chariot right you're invited to come up and be his wife amen and you wait till he calls because between the feet and all the way to his side you've got to stay here and wait till he invites you to his side you know they say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach I beg to differ the way to a man's heart is exactly respect at the feet and wait till the husband takes takes and invites the point I'm making is you have to get to the Brass altar first before you invited to the altar of incense and She lays at his feet and he's startled M Caro hey God wake up get out of your sleep we need fire down here yeah and he's startled and there's a whole line of words there and she went down and on the floor and did according to when boas had eaten and was drunk and his heart was Merry and he went to lay down at the Heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid that word afraid is important and turned himself and oh that word and turn himself is important I don't have time and beheld a woman laying at his feet and he said who art thou and she said I am Ruth thine hand Maiden she already identified herself as his at the feet spread therefore thy skirt and th over thine handmaiden for thou art a near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou my daughter for thou has showed more kindness than the latter end than the beginning as much as thou has follows not young men whether poor or Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do I will tell thee what Thou shalt requirest for all the city shall know that thou art a virtuous woman your reputation has gone ahead of you amen amen amen and now it is true that I am thy near Kinsman how be it there's a Kinsman nearer than I and I don't want to get into that cuz that'll take too much time I say God bless you this [Applause] morning it's all stanner brother on going to come you know just a closing remark huh you ever wondered if the scripture was accurate and if the scripture could show you things to come it's amazing what's in the Bible and how it's written do you remember there's a girl I feel sorry for in the Bible actually I feel sorry for her her name was Jezebel can you imagine a girl that's a daughter of a PR least than a king now that girl dad had no time for her at all and that girl got shoved to the side because he had meetings to go to too often and then his dad was a priest and then surrounded her with a bunch of religion and that girl just got harder and harder and harder and harder and I feel sorry for Jezebel because you can't imagine that that girl got hurt so many times that she said I'm never going to trust the man again they'll make promises and then they break him they make promises then they break him and finally the insecurity in her would only find a man she could control because she was hurt you know the story you get Jezebel married Ahab the reason Jezebel married Ahab because he was a dishrag and she needed a dishrag to stay safe she couldn't handle a man stronger than but what I find interesting in these stories is that in the end you'll find Ahab brother Brandon does some amazing things he takes Ahab and types Ahab to JFK and and and when brother Brandon came to open the church ages it was 1960 he knew those Church ages had to open because Ahab was on the throne JFK was on the throne all right I I want you to I'm saying this as icing this is the cherry on the icing okay do you know it is so interesting to this day they still don't know who killed JFK right you can go anywhere you want it's still a big argument and a mystery and all this kind of stuff you know what's interesting here's what's interesting JFK right if you find out Ahab Ahab died in First Kings First Kings uh the 22nd chapter the 35th verse First Kings 22 verse 35 that's the verse where Ahab dies JFK was killed in the 11th month on the 22nd day and he was the 35th President of the United States it's so amazing to me that first Kings is the 11th book in the Bible do you know that he was killed on the 22nd of November the 11th months and Ahab Ahab dies in the 22nd chapter you know what gets really more weird he was the 25th president of the United States of 35th sorry now go to verse 35 in your Bible and it's amazing how that Bible types it out exactly for all the unbelievers if they don't believe brother Brandon was true because the Bible says in a certain man no name certain man right who was he don't know what is his name don't know what is he trying to do don't know a certain man pulled up a bow and arrow and said I'll take a chance a predestinated arrow correct from a man unidentified wow I say our God is great yeah that's the Bible God bless you brother on come amen amen yeah praise the [Applause] Lord oh I Marvel at God's word God's Ministries God's administrations and everything and I do want to take a moment to thank brother
