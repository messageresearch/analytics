[42:32] something about his so natural behind
[42:35] the pulpit just so amen heartfelt I'm
[42:39] going to put a little bow on them today
[42:42] but I believe he's got a heart for the
[42:44] people I really do and I know you feel
[42:47] it you know it that's the reason why you
[42:48] stand with him and that's the best
[42:51] pastor could have for the people to
[42:53] stand with him in the good and in the
[42:55] bad amen because remember one thing
[42:57] we're all human we're all born here
[43:00] sexual like all the rest we are looking
[43:03] for that
[43:04] transformation and this Mortal body will
[43:06] be done away with but until then we need
[43:10] grace mercy love understanding we need
[43:13] to care for one another we need to stand
[43:15] for one another when we're wrong and
[43:18] when they're wrong I'm not wrong too
[43:20] many times
[43:22] but I I I one of the fellas said home he
[43:26] he made a mistake once he thought he was
[43:29] wrong that's getting pretty close but I
[43:31] want to say that not jokingly I believe
[43:34] we're as close to the reality of our new
[43:36] bodies that we've ever been in all the
[43:39] history of mankind Lord we are the ones
[43:42] that God chose to take off the last
[43:44] moments of civilization as we know it
[43:48] there's a much greater civilization
[43:50] coming we feel it in our soul we know
[43:53] it's born inside we know that our Soul's
[43:55] repres presents that Dimension cuz it's
[43:58] born of the Holy Ghost this body is born
[44:02] of the Flesh and must die and all of us
[44:06] sitting here 50 years 100 years would go
[44:08] by there wouldn't be one of us here here
[44:11] we have no continuing city am I want to
[44:15] sing I'll try to get the brothers that
[44:18] we didn't practice at all can I use that
[44:20] might maybe I'll turn this one
[44:21] off just turn it down just turn it down
[44:25] thank you and I was asking about one
[44:27] song and and
[44:30] um you know
[44:33] sometimes it's on is it on it's on yeah
[44:36] okay wasn't sure where that's my voice
[44:39] doesn't need a microphone really but but
[44:42] I but I was thinking a while ago on so
[44:45] many things we do one things we uh I
[44:48] Don't Preach as much but I sure still
[44:49] think a
[44:50] lot there's something about you know you
[44:52] older people you'll kind of get with me
[44:54] now most most of the things we think of
[44:56] what we should have been doing how much
[44:59] more we should have been in love with
[45:01] the Lord how much more we should have
[45:03] done for
[45:04] him not regretting the miles that we've
[45:07] traveled for him but at the same time I
[45:10] think we always feel oh if I could have
[45:12] just did a little bit better been a
[45:14] little more genuine real there's one
[45:17] thing that we know that will stand is
[45:18] the genuine product of God the genuine
[45:21] born of the spirit of God now we know
[45:24] there's many things that goes on but I
[45:27] was driving along talking to the Lord in
[45:29] my as we do and what I always like about
[45:32] you can tell him just the way it is he
[45:35] doesn't mind the way you tell it to him
[45:38] cuz he knows what your heart's behind it
[45:41] whether you're stumble or you don't and
[45:44] I we were someone been talking about
[45:46] well they own this and they own that and
[45:48] they own that and oh they this that and
[45:50] I was driving along and said and the
[45:52] poor heard him
[45:54] gladly
[45:56] they couldn't point to that but as I
[45:58] sing a little further something said but
[46:00] remember you don't own a single thing on
[46:02] this
[46:03] Earth everything that we
[46:06] have we give it up when we die so really
[46:10] it's just
[46:12] borrowed and he borrows it gives us a
[46:14] bigger loan sometimes we are deeper in
[46:16] debt than the other
[46:17] one but you know even the debts are
[46:19] wiped when when we die all things are
[46:23] wiped except for one thing that Soul
[46:25] that's inside of you that is eternal
[46:28] that's either got eternal life or
[46:31] it's Eternal separation from God that
[46:34] means it could have never been in there
[46:36] think about but pilgrims and we're
[46:39] strangers here we are sitting we are
[46:43] seeking for that City that Abraham
[46:45] looked for he wasn't just looking for
[46:47] like a NE building brother said he was
[46:48] looking for that Soul Redemption that
[46:51] new body that Immortal
[46:53] seed knowing that it has in its cities
[46:57] and there is a great City coming we know
[47:00] that invisible Union is what he's
[47:02] looking for being so invisible United
[47:04] back with God where we came from or come
[47:07] the way we should have come that's right
[47:09] amen and I want to see sing the song
[47:12] Palms of Victory it starts in key of uh
[47:15] starts in key of C and then goes to D
[47:18] after the
[47:19] first after the first song in
[47:23] course and if you want to sing it with
[47:25] me I this just the one that I figured I
[47:27] could sing because I know this is real
[47:30] to
[47:31] me I don't know how many year days I've
[47:33] got left I'm I'm over the 80 Mark and I
[47:37] at home I quit pastoring about a year
[47:40] ago I don't regret it but I I say this
[47:45] whatever years I've got left I've
[47:47] noticed all my life since I've been a
[47:50] Christian my longing is for just the
[47:53] next
[47:54] Hill what's around the next promise of
[47:57] God what's greater than what I'm living
[47:59] in what is greater than I have today in
[48:01] the promise of God
[48:04] Amen I saw a wayward traveler in garment
[48:09] sted clad he was struggling up the
[48:13] mountain and it seemed that he was sad
[48:17] his back was heavy laden his strength
[48:21] was almost gone but he shouted as he
[48:25] journeyed
[48:26] Deliverance will come then Pals of
[48:31] Victory Crown of Glory Pals of
[48:37] Victory I shall
[48:41] win I saw him in the evening the sun was
[48:46] sinking low he had overcome the mountain
[48:51] and he reached the S below he saw that
[48:55] golden City that Everlasting home and he
[49:00] shouted like hosana Deliverance will
[49:04] come then Palms of Victory crowns of
[49:10] Glory palm of Victory I shall

[50:52] saints that have all labored yes they
[50:54] died that we could
[50:57] live remember the seed that went in the
[50:59] ground had to die rot and die that there
[51:03] could come a crop in the
[51:05] reformation and come all the way to the
[51:08] headship where now we believe we're at
[51:10] that place where Christ the word has
[51:12] settled down on a mystical body
[51:15] literally on Earth you're now ready to
[51:18] be transformed from Mortal to
[51:21] immortality that's that's the joy that

[53:21] but have accepted the revelation of
[53:24] Jesus Christ yeah for it is written Lord
[53:27] the day that when your disciples were
[53:29] there and you asked them who do men say
[53:33] I the son of man
[53:34] am they said well Isaiah Jeremiah one of
[53:37] the prophets but who do you say that I
[53:40] am and Peter that day spoke so boldly
[53:44] said Lord Thou Art the Christ the son of
[53:46] the Living God and you said blessed art
[53:48] thou Simon barjona for flesh and blood
[53:51] has not revealed this unto you but my
[53:54] father which is in heaven Upon This Rock
[53:58] I will build my church and the Gates of

[54:12] there's some sick here may they walk out
[54:15] well may they learn to reach out and lay
[54:17] a hold of your promise for we're not
[54:19] introducing man or wash Spirit Lord
[54:21] we're not trying to get the people to be
[54:22] like us we want them to be you Lord
[54:25] amen and we're not trying to make
[54:27] ourselves look this way or that way
[54:30] we're trying to get the eyes of the
[54:32] people on Jesus Christ that they saw no
[54:35] man save Jesus only let it be that way
[54:38] in this age for there's a bride standing
[54:40] and their eyes are holy on the
[54:42] bridegroom thank you now for your grace
[54:44] bless us now as we go to your word in
[54:46] Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God
[54:50] bless you you can be
[54:51] seated I want
[54:53] to just dra a little on that if I can uh
[54:57] as I'm uh
[54:59] coasting uh we
[55:01] are uh watching the
[55:04] unfolding and uh some of the young
[55:07] people of course I realize you're all
[55:09] starting in life and you're full of
[55:11] energy and and you should be that way I
[55:14] believe that whatever we do we should do
[55:15] it
[55:16] wholeheartedly if you're going to work
[55:18] somewhere do it with all your heart if
[55:20] you're going to put your heart to
[55:21] something give it your all amen but keep
[55:25] Christ first in all things whatever you
[55:27] do you're a Christian you're born again
[55:29] and when you get to the place to where
[55:31] there's nobody to tell the things about
[55:34] talk it over with the Lord he's always
[55:35] there he's not one that's far away he's
[55:38] always near and U but I love this part
[55:42] my peace I give unto
[55:46] thee and if I could just spend a little
[55:48] time you know there's something about uh
[55:51] of course we love music we love singing
[55:53] and and uh this is just a while ago I
[55:55] was uh we were had a all special night
[55:59] where the young people were singing and
[56:02] and there was a couple of
[56:03] specials instrument specials and the one
[56:06] was uh couple of the violin
[56:09] players uh they uh they they played a
[56:13] tune I I didn't know them I I knew the
[56:15] song faintly but I didn't really know it
[56:17] good but as they started playing I I
[56:20] closed my eyes and and began to think
[56:23] and hearing the music oh it was so
[56:26] beautiful and I I thought my that's
[56:28] wonderful and I got thinking that's uh
[56:32] how Saul must have felt when David
[56:34] started
[56:35] playing and I I felt like you know by
[56:37] the time they were finished if I had an
[56:39] evil spirit in me it was
[56:40] gone it just seemed like oh my music it
[56:45] just evaporated everything that was I
[56:48] thought evil was gone and I thought yes
[56:51] you know the brother Bram says so many
[56:53] times God has so many ways of healing so
[56:56] many ways of
[56:57] encouraging you don't have to preach uh
[57:01] maybe a song like we heard here oh I
[57:03] claim the
[57:05] blood uh you know just how many times do
[57:08] we do that oh every day we get to a
[57:11] place and say oh Lord let thy blood
[57:13] stand for me let thy token not the
[57:16] chemistry of the blood but the token the
[57:17] Holy Ghost let it stand for me in this
[57:20] position there's healing in music that
[57:23] sometimes just a kind word
[57:25] amen you walk up to somebody maybe shake
[57:27] his hand don't don't even know what
[57:28] you're doing you know sons of God many
[57:31] times don't know what they're doing the
[57:32] brother bam says the Bible is written
[57:34] that way they didn't even know what
[57:35] they're doing they just spoke it and
[57:37] went
[57:38] on and some of them didn't know that
[57:40] they were prophesying that wouldn't
[57:41] happen for 800 years or more later yeah
[57:44] Isaiah 60 you know talking about gross
[57:47] Darkness being upon the the Earth well
[57:49] that Prophet spoke that and it was
[57:51] darker and darker and darker but never a
[57:53] day like this day amen
[57:56] amen you know uh you just stop and think
[57:58] a minute and uh which we do that always
[58:02] but we think about the uh the evil how
[58:05] it
[58:06] conel and brother Bram when he talks
[58:08] about light and
[58:10] darkness he tells us that the light is
[58:12] what pushes the darkness together yeah
[58:16] let me tell this and I you might not you
[58:19] might understand like I do or I'm going
[58:21] to say it but it's this message that
[58:23] pushes the darkness together together
[58:25] it's the light of this gospel do you
[58:27] know not even 50 years ago when I was
[58:29] first uh it's been 52 years ago 53 this
[58:33] summer since God called me to preach and
[58:35] at that time I thought it was already
[58:37] too late
[58:39] 1970 but at that time all the
[58:42] denominations they were all still
[58:44] standing alone and pushing the other
[58:46] ones said we're the only ones but have
[58:48] you noticed how they've all gathered
[58:50] together
[58:51] now it's all the darkness that wasn't
[58:54] word is pushed back together
[58:57] yeah and it's literally done that and it
[59:00] was the message of this hour it was that
[59:02] thus sayith the Lord watch how the
[59:03] prophet started preaching things he
[59:05] would talk a little bit and say well now
[59:06] that's all I'll say today he said for
[59:08] instance said there's there's two
[59:09] classes there's two churches right
[59:12] that's on the Earth right now now we
[59:14] read the parts that upon my
[59:17] spirit my people that's it yes right now
[59:21] there is there is a Jesus said upon this
[59:25] rock I will build my
[59:27] church and here comes the prophet
[59:29] preacher Satan's Eden and said there's
[59:30] another church that's being built in
[59:32] that Satan's
[59:34] Eden and both claim to be the bride of
[59:37] Christ both claim they got all the
[59:39] blessings of God they got all the truth
[59:41] of God come on but the two churches are
[59:43] being built side by side amen but it's
[59:46] this message that pushes all those
[59:48] unbelieving Spirits together against the
[59:51] True Light Of God but remember Darkness
[59:54] never overcomes light light always
[59:57] overcomes
[59:59] Darkness the smallest of light say I am
[1:00:01] so little but that little bit of light
[1:00:03] will push the darkness out of the way
[1:00:05] just walk in
[1:00:06] it but I like the way the prophet brings
[1:00:09] us sometimes you know you you read
[1:00:10] message and in the message of birth
[1:00:12] pains brother B talks a little bit about
[1:00:13] it and said the classes of people u in
[1:00:17] the Christian
[1:00:18] way said both claimed to be the
[1:00:21] bride but the light has drove it all the
[1:00:23] religious Darkness to together from
[1:00:25] Pentecost back to
[1:00:29] Catholicism drove it together tell me
[1:00:32] what drove them together it's the light
[1:00:35] that did that if this glorious gospel
[1:00:38] hadn't hadn't shine and begin to push it
[1:00:41] back they couldn't take the light of the
[1:00:43] word they can't take the word only the
[1:00:46] predestinate can we know that now but we
[1:00:48] didn't always understand that sure
[1:00:51] there's a lot of things when we look
[1:00:52] back now say oh well now we understand
[1:00:55] yeah now we see why they could come
[1:00:57] right up to it and say but thou being a
[1:00:59] man makest thyself
[1:01:02] god well he said all right if you don't
[1:01:04] believe who I am said then believe the
[1:01:07] works but I tell you one thing he said
[1:01:09] if you don't believe that I am he you'll
[1:01:10] die in your sin that's correct cuz he
[1:01:13] manifested the word only amen this
[1:01:16] message in itself is not some Creed that
[1:01:18] we put together few little doctors that
[1:01:20] we we push our way and say well I I
[1:01:22] believe this much but not the rest no
[1:01:23] you take the whole word pertinence and
[1:01:26] all amen am there's a lot of things
[1:01:28] aren't very comfortable to eat there's a
[1:01:30] lot of things pastors have to preach on
[1:01:32] I've been a pastor all these years
[1:01:33] there's a lot of things he doesn't like
[1:01:35] to preach on because it doesn't make you
[1:01:37] too
[1:01:38] popular right but if God puts it on your
[1:01:41] heart you'll preach it anyhow whether
[1:01:42] you're popular or not after all we're
[1:01:45] not looking for a popularity
[1:01:47] contest we're looking to lead people to
[1:01:50] that place and stand there and said I
[1:01:51] have not shun to declare the whole
[1:01:53] Council of God I never kept back
[1:01:54] anything I like that what brother ra
[1:01:56] said like Paul
[1:01:58] said you know I one of the brothers was
[1:02:00] preaching here I don't know if it might
[1:02:01] have been you brother Ron but you
[1:02:02] preaching about brother Paul and how how
[1:02:04] he could stand there with such Assurance
[1:02:07] yeah
[1:02:08] yeah nobody could stand there like he
[1:02:11] did and his dispensation said if an
[1:02:12] angel from
[1:02:14] heaven or any other Angel come and
[1:02:16] preach anything different than what I
[1:02:17] preach let him be a cursed he didn't
[1:02:19] just say well just disagree with him a
[1:02:20] little bit he said let him be a
[1:02:23] cursed he wasn't he wasn't and when he
[1:02:26] got maybe a little bit maybe puffed up
[1:02:28] with it and he besought the Lord on you
[1:02:31] know three times because his eyes
[1:02:32] weren't healing right he had to write
[1:02:35] with large letters as the prophet said
[1:02:37] yeah and he knew God was more than a
[1:02:40] Healer one word in his eyes would normal
[1:02:42] again he already healed him and brought
[1:02:44] him back to
[1:02:46] eyesight but the light struck him down
[1:02:48] and let a per left left a permanent mark
[1:02:52] on
[1:02:53] him i' call it a
[1:02:55] seal left a seal on him that nothing
[1:02:58] could unseal it and Paul with all that
[1:03:01] and he got a little bit must have got a
[1:03:03] little weary because he asked him three
[1:03:06] times I must have weared him many times
[1:03:08] more than CU many times ask way more
[1:03:11] than three
[1:03:12] times but
[1:03:14] Paul in in that moment the Lord said
[1:03:17] Paul don't ask me
[1:03:18] again my grace is
[1:03:21] sufficient God knew how to keep him
[1:03:23] humble yeah in all that where he stood
[1:03:26] there said again I say if an angel come
[1:03:28] or any other person let him be
[1:03:31] accursed now watch the angel of this day
[1:03:34] take that same stand I always love this
[1:03:35] part when brother went beyond the
[1:03:37] curtain of time and he come and he's
[1:03:38] telling the church and said and and he's
[1:03:40] standing there in that in that
[1:03:42] presence that Holy
[1:03:45] presence and he's
[1:03:47] talking and he said all will have to be
[1:03:51] judged by this word he said will Paul
[1:03:52] have to be judged yes oh he said thank
[1:03:55] the Lord he said that I know I'm okay he
[1:03:58] took the spiritual stats of cope and
[1:04:00] scope and he began to look at his life
[1:04:01] and said if Paul's made it I've made it
[1:04:05] already I've made it just as good cuz
[1:04:07] where he baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:04:09] Christ I did where he whatever whatever
[1:04:11] he preached I preached
[1:04:13] it I remember brother Bill da one time
[1:04:15] we got to know him uh just a little bit
[1:04:18] I got to know glattus better than bill
[1:04:20] but um he was uh I I forget the message
[1:04:24] now sh I think it's shalom I'm not sure
[1:04:25] but he was talking to brother Bram said
[1:04:27] brother Bram uh you think I'm all right
[1:04:29] now i' I've been baptized I've repented
[1:04:32] i' I've changed my life I'm 90 some
[1:04:34] years old and uh you think I'm all right
[1:04:36] he said well brother Bill he said let's
[1:04:38] take God's Stope and just check it out I
[1:04:41] like that every once in a while it's
[1:04:43] good you know do that in your own life
[1:04:44] just focus your life on taking start
[1:04:46] letting the heartbeat uh read to you
[1:04:49] what you really are how do you feel
[1:04:51] about this blessed message what do you
[1:04:53] what do you you willing to to trade for
[1:04:55] it what would you give to even
[1:04:57] compromise for it come on and you read
[1:05:00] your
[1:05:01] heartbeat oh there's nothing well what
[1:05:04] about popularity money or Pride or
[1:05:06] something oh you're barking up the wrong
[1:05:08] tree amen that is not even There's No
[1:05:11] Kun up there don't even go there because
[1:05:14] here we have nothing that holds us here
[1:05:16] there's only one I I I we've been
[1:05:18] married 61 going on 62 years and uh I
[1:05:21] know I know what love is naturally
[1:05:25] I know what that is and I thank the Lord
[1:05:27] for every heartbeat but I realize this
[1:05:30] is just something that we're passing
[1:05:33] through I don't ever be without I don't
[1:05:35] I don't believe we ever be without my
[1:05:36] wife without our in
[1:05:38] because see I do believe there's matches
[1:05:42] made in
[1:05:43] heaven yes no you can get the wrong
[1:05:46] spouse here that is true you can marry
[1:05:49] wrong here but it won't be that way over
[1:05:50] there amen but I do believe that brother
[1:05:54] BR absolutely teaches that if God
[1:05:58] whatsoever God hath joined together not
[1:06:01] a even a preacher you can't join them
[1:06:03] together you can speak the word over
[1:06:05] them but whatever God has put together
[1:06:07] let no man put us something God puts
[1:06:10] them when I see a young couple like that
[1:06:11] I pray that God has put that young
[1:06:13] couple I believe that we must believe
[1:06:15] that we move in that area we must
[1:06:17] believe what God puts together and when
[1:06:20] when you fall for somebody that you love
[1:06:22] you you check it out you use stetoscope
[1:06:25] of God's word and you begin to check out
[1:06:26] your own heart how do I feel till death
[1:06:30] do us part right amen yeah not you know
[1:06:34] how it is you get through little cases
[1:06:35] and pastors we we all our life we deal
[1:06:37] with them they're so sweet they oh when
[1:06:39] they come to the altar oh the Pomp and
[1:06:41] everything's so
[1:06:43] beautiful oh they cry and they said till
[1:06:46] death do us
[1:06:47] part in sickness or in
[1:06:51] health until there's not any money left
[1:06:56] but there's so many have another thing
[1:06:58] behind that till
[1:07:02] until they put it little something well
[1:07:04] yeah so far but I I can't take
[1:07:07] anymore let me tell you genuine love
[1:07:10] stands the test every time amen genuine
[1:07:14] love for God's word this message is not
[1:07:16] just something that we like to take
[1:07:18] lightly and say well I I underlined that
[1:07:20] one yes but that was just leaving room
[1:07:22] for the next underlining
[1:07:25] because we underline every word of God
[1:07:27] is thus sayith the Lord God has never
[1:07:29] had to write and even brother BR we took
[1:07:31] the history and showed us how that this
[1:07:33] book was compiled by by God there was
[1:07:36] other books
[1:07:37] written many of them you know good books
[1:07:40] but God compiled this in 66 books and
[1:07:43] called it his word yes he said if you
[1:07:46] move a punctuation even as much or move
[1:07:48] a meaning anywhere said your names will
[1:07:50] be taken out of the book of or the
[1:07:52] plagues at it that's how perfect it is
[1:07:55] and even in the writings when brother
[1:07:57] bam teaches and you know it comes to the
[1:08:00] place where sometimes he get looks for a
[1:08:02] greater meaning of that he's not trying
[1:08:05] to change the
[1:08:07] meaning he's trying to get a greater
[1:08:09] understanding so even the commoner many
[1:08:11] times the languages have changed and
[1:08:13] Customs change but but in there when
[1:08:16] brother Bill DA got to him they were
[1:08:19] they were talking he said well let's go
[1:08:21] let's go take the stetoscope and say and
[1:08:23] he said so I turned over to John said he
[1:08:27] that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:08:29] him that sent
[1:08:32] me has already passed from death into
[1:08:34] life and shall not even come into
[1:08:35] judgment has already passed from death
[1:08:36] into life
[1:08:38] amen he said you believe that said with
[1:08:40] all my heart and he went through other
[1:08:42] things of the scripture and said you
[1:08:44] believe that said yes he said you passed
[1:08:47] the
[1:08:48] testuj you know you know just like we do
[1:08:50] in the when the doctor you know all that
[1:08:52] feels good when you go for examination
[1:08:54] your physical and you would oh my heart
[1:08:57] felt a little different oh my blood
[1:08:58] pressure is a little high oh I got this
[1:08:59] I I got this feeling and finally when
[1:09:01] you I know I just went through one and
[1:09:05] uh you know you're thinking oh that this
[1:09:07] aches a little bit this is a little a
[1:09:08] place and things like that and said
[1:09:09] what's going to be the scope when he
[1:09:11] when he adds it all up and uh boy he
[1:09:14] felt pretty good when he said no nothing
[1:09:15] wrong here no no no nothing
[1:09:18] no
[1:09:20] oh that felt good oh a little bit little
[1:09:22] bit High here a little bit here no but
[1:09:24] it's in the place okay I said that's
[1:09:26] good thank you Doctor don't say
[1:09:31] anymore because we all want to feel good
[1:09:34] don't we and I thank the Lord but
[1:09:38] see thou will keep him in perfect peace
[1:09:42] we were talking on this and just so
[1:09:44] yesterday I was reading and you know
[1:09:46] brother Bram talks so much about
[1:09:49] the as he moved into the third pole he
[1:09:52] he collected he said now I can't say
[1:09:53] this to the world but to you you see
[1:09:56] it's not given to all
[1:09:58] men to as many as we
[1:10:01] believe yes you might sit right in the
[1:10:03] church where the gospel is being
[1:10:05] preached and say I don't know about that
[1:10:06] and well I I think it should be this way
[1:10:09] do you rightfully when it comes to the
[1:10:10] word of God we have but one thing to do
[1:10:12] say Lord I
[1:10:14] believe try sometimes and we all do is
[1:10:17] to analyze how is God going to do this
[1:10:23] have you ever done that I must be I must
[1:10:26] be one of them that's done it because
[1:10:28] when I look at the world that is here
[1:10:32] now 8 billion and more
[1:10:35] people a world of economics and inner
[1:10:40] inner net I mean what will it take to
[1:10:43] change it and make it a new for the
[1:10:46] righteous to walk out over top of the
[1:10:48] ashes of the wicked right it will take
[1:10:51] the fire of God like it took the fire
[1:10:53] fire of God to cleanse you and and take
[1:10:55] all the love of the world out of you it
[1:10:57] took the fire of God it didn't just take
[1:10:59] the justification it didn't just take
[1:11:01] the sanctification it took the baptism
[1:11:03] of the Holy Ghost to take the love of
[1:11:05] the world out of you to take the love
[1:11:07] and and you know many times people they
[1:11:09] get the feeling like brother bam talks
[1:11:10] in the Pentecostal area he said you know
[1:11:12] they got they got the shout you know oh
[1:11:13] Hallelujah I oh I got a new feeling said
[1:11:16] and most of them said didn't even have a
[1:11:17] a good enough Spirit to get along with
[1:11:19] themselves so he said God has to give
[1:11:21] you a new spirit and a new heart
[1:11:24] so that he can give you his Spirit but
[1:11:26] many times we get a new spirit a new
[1:11:27] heart think I got it I got it oh I'm so
[1:11:29] happy now no that's still can end up in
[1:11:33] Emotion but when he gives you his Spirit
[1:11:36] the Holy Spirit it agrees with the word
[1:11:37] of God in the season that you're
[1:11:40] in it does just say oh Luther was a man
[1:11:42] of God Weser was a man of God it says
[1:11:43] this day is this scripture
[1:11:45] fulfilled I remember when I preaching I
[1:11:48] was in brother B's meetings that was the
[1:11:49] one thing that I had the blessing of and
[1:11:51] I stand here how many was ever in
[1:11:53] brother meetings I don't see mik there
[1:11:56] oh yeah yeah mik bless your heart were
[1:11:58] you all little people then yeah young
[1:12:00] people me too the first time I was 15
[1:12:03] when I was in brother bram's meetings
[1:12:05] and uh the last time I was in brother
[1:12:07] Brams meetings I was 23 years old had
[1:12:10] two little children a good
[1:12:12] wife and uh but but in the message that
[1:12:15] there was those those are the series of
[1:12:17] the marriage and divorce
[1:12:18] series but when he preached the message
[1:12:20] this day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:12:24] it began to develop such a reality in my
[1:12:26] heart I begin to realize that now that
[1:12:29] that Jesus Christ is the same yes
[1:12:32] yesterday today and forever he is that
[1:12:35] remember when he went beyond the curtain
[1:12:37] of time brother B said I I can't explain
[1:12:39] it he said I haven't got the vocabulary
[1:12:42] to give it a name to title it the the
[1:12:45] what I feeling the only thing he said
[1:12:47] there was an Ever presence there there's
[1:12:49] no tomorrow no yesterday nothing else
[1:12:51] just an Ever presence
[1:12:54] now that's eternal
[1:12:56] life ever presence that's why he said he
[1:13:00] he is the unchanging God he can never
[1:13:03] change his mind about his word because
[1:13:05] that's what he
[1:13:06] is so when God ever says something just
[1:13:09] mark it down it's going to be just that
[1:13:10] way whether it takes 2,000 years or no
[1:13:12] more look at the things you talked about
[1:13:14] the darkness and gross Darkness Isaiah
[1:13:16] he's prophesying and maybe he preached
[1:13:18] that morning with such inspiration and
[1:13:20] when he finished it he thought what was
[1:13:21] I saying yeah I I don't even understand
[1:13:25] what I was saying come
[1:13:28] on do you think brother Braham
[1:13:29] understood he said I'm going to I'm
[1:13:31] going up there and said go back to
[1:13:32] Jeffersonville and preach those Seven
[1:13:34] Seals do you know when he when he went
[1:13:36] into the first night he went into the
[1:13:37] room to wait on the Lord for a message
[1:13:39] that night the first seal yes Christ
[1:13:41] first of all amen God in Simplicity but
[1:13:45] then he preached the first seal said I
[1:13:46] went into that room he said I started to
[1:13:49] think and and nothing came said I I
[1:13:52] didn't know where to start start right
[1:13:54] yeah I thought I'd just go back and read
[1:13:56] some of the previous notes yeah which
[1:13:59] were totally wrong so much so that he
[1:14:02] came and said corrected the
[1:14:05] a thought the white horse rider was
[1:14:08] Christ right come on but that deceived
[1:14:11] church right that's building here now
[1:14:14] there's one that's not deceived but
[1:14:15] there's one that is
[1:14:17] deceived those are the two that's here
[1:14:19] now
[1:14:20] building and that's the light and the
[1:14:22] Darkness yes one word off is Darkness
[1:14:25] but in there when he when he took that
[1:14:26] he said I would have made the same
[1:14:28] mistake I did last
[1:14:30] time he said then he came Hallelujah and
[1:14:34] it changed my whole mind and I stood
[1:14:37] back and I looked at said oh
[1:14:40] my that's who that is that's what that
[1:14:43] is he said I've always preached it but I
[1:14:46] didn't know it this way and he starts
[1:14:47] and he comes back seal after seal and
[1:14:49] when he is finished at the end what's he
[1:14:52] saying he said eight straight days he
[1:14:55] met me in that
[1:14:57] room and told us the truth of all the
[1:15:01] ages said most of it was
[1:15:02] history right but it came right into the
[1:15:05] seventh seal and said the only thing it
[1:15:06] did not reveal is when he's
[1:15:08] coming oh that's a good
[1:15:11] one oh yeah but see I like what he said
[1:15:15] if if it did we'd probably get so carnal
[1:15:17] we just say well you know what he's not
[1:15:18] coming until 19 19 or
[1:15:21] 2029 so I got five
[1:15:24] years come
[1:15:26] on you know what we
[1:15:28] do oh my well could we get any busier
[1:15:31] than what we are now I'm retired and I'm
[1:15:33] as busy as can
[1:15:35] be but I'm not I'm not drilling Wells
[1:15:38] and I'm not building homes or anything
[1:15:40] like that I'm just trying to keep the
[1:15:42] one that I'm in and I want to stay there
[1:15:44] as long as I
[1:15:47] can Amen brother amen but this glorious
[1:15:50] message and I just I love it because to
[1:15:52] me
[1:15:54] it's all my
[1:15:56] life how many times do we go to this
[1:15:59] message and we preachers and brother Ron
[1:16:01] sitting behind me I know for a fact how
[1:16:04] many times does he go before the Lord
[1:16:06] and takes a statcope of God's word yes
[1:16:09] and he said Lord God what am I going to
[1:16:11] bring to this people what kind of a meal
[1:16:14] am I going to set before them that they
[1:16:16] can eat and be full and come away seeing
[1:16:19] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:16:21] forever seeing the unchanging God in
[1:16:23] your personal life yes when things go
[1:16:25] wrong in your homes which they do when
[1:16:28] Trouble Comes Your Way which it
[1:16:29] will when darkness comes to press its
[1:16:32] way back trying to push the light
[1:16:34] out just breathe your name in prayer no
[1:16:37] matter how many times brother B said
[1:16:38] when he said take the name of Jesus with
[1:16:40] you as a shield from every snare and
[1:16:44] when Temptations around you gather which
[1:16:46] they will you just get out of the
[1:16:48] presence of God get all alone and and
[1:16:50] you get in a certain place and you see
[1:16:52] something ah I know many times you just
[1:16:54] you something comes before you say I
[1:16:56] wasn't even looking for
[1:16:58] that no but he was Satan was trying to
[1:17:02] drown you and take you away from that
[1:17:04] straight walk cuz he knows when he sees
[1:17:06] that that spiritual walk he knows you're
[1:17:09] not fooling him either that's right no
[1:17:13] sir that that perfect what I'm trying to
[1:17:16] say is this I I think brother bam tells
[1:17:18] us so many times in Little stories but
[1:17:20] but U uh you know I'm
[1:17:25] well I'll just say it this
[1:17:26] way I I'm I'm a dreamer in
[1:17:30] life but they're
[1:17:33] dangerous cuz I realize a dream without
[1:17:37] it coming to pass just the way you
[1:17:38] dreamed it you better leave it
[1:17:42] alone most of the dreams that I've had
[1:17:44] in my life I've had to leave alone they
[1:17:46] were probably for
[1:17:48] me but I was dreaming just a little
[1:17:50] while ago I don't know why but but all
[1:17:53] of a sudden I got the dream and here I'm
[1:17:54] Dreaming I'm seeing brother brandom and
[1:17:57] Becky and
[1:17:58] Sarah doing that which he had told us
[1:18:01] they did remember when he came back from
[1:18:03] the trip and they they couldn't wait
[1:18:04] they finally fell asleep and he came up
[1:18:06] late and and and so finally uh in the
[1:18:08] morning he got up and sat in the chair
[1:18:09] and when the first one Becky uh woke up
[1:18:11] and she run said oh jumped on daddy's
[1:18:13] knee they'd been waiting all night but
[1:18:15] they' fallen asleep I was dreaming
[1:18:18] that and you know the story comes out
[1:18:20] this way Becky says I've got all Daddy
[1:18:23] and Sarah finally gets on the other knee
[1:18:25] and said listen my sisters I'll tell you
[1:18:27] one thing you might have all of daddy
[1:18:29] but Daddy's got all of me you know the
[1:18:32] story and I'm dreaming that and I woke
[1:18:34] up I don't I don't know what that means
[1:18:36] but Lord I said one thing just you have
[1:18:39] all of me amen no matter what happens
[1:18:43] all I ask Lord that you'd have all of me
[1:18:47] I might let go at times and I know I do
[1:18:50] I might stumble at times and I know I do
[1:18:53] but Lord don't let go of me I want you
[1:18:56] to have all of me
[1:19:00] that's I was reading where brother Ram
[1:19:02] talks and you know when you read that
[1:19:04] part said we've had faith for healings
[1:19:07] we've had faith for deliverance we've
[1:19:08] had faith for
[1:19:10] reformations but so now we're coming to
[1:19:12] the place where we're going to need some
[1:19:13] special Faith it's called rapturing
[1:19:16] faith and I was a bit weary one day
[1:19:20] thinking and somebody had said something
[1:19:22] you know how we we begin to compare
[1:19:24] ourselves it's never good to do that
[1:19:27] always compare yourself with the word of
[1:19:28] God but but we something was said well
[1:19:31] we're going to need some and a minister
[1:19:32] come up and he said you know started
[1:19:34] talking he said I don't know what this
[1:19:35] Rapture said but I'm not ready for the
[1:19:39] Rapture I wouldn't want to minister
[1:19:40] preaching my Pulpit that's not ready for
[1:19:42] the Rapture
[1:19:44] amen I'm ready anyhow see well how you
[1:19:47] think you got that faith I believe so
[1:19:49] you know why yes cuz he said if you need
[1:19:52] it
[1:19:53] he'll give it to you if God Be You
[1:19:55] therefore perfect even as your father
[1:19:57] which is in heaven is perfect if God
[1:19:59] expects and demands that we have
[1:20:01] Perfection he's got to give it to
[1:20:03] us then I like what brother baham said
[1:20:05] you know in little message called said
[1:20:07] the the Supreme Grace will give supreme
[1:20:10] power for the Supreme
[1:20:13] hour if rapturing faith is required yes
[1:20:17] don't you believe that the message the
[1:20:19] word that we're now feeding on has got
[1:20:21] rapturing faith in it I believe it does
[1:20:23] that's the reason why I never take my I
[1:20:25] don't look east west north or south I
[1:20:26] say right on the message I don't I'm not
[1:20:29] criticizing ministers and preachers but
[1:20:31] there's a lot of ministers are not
[1:20:32] preaching the faith even around this
[1:20:35] message there's a lot of things that's
[1:20:37] going on so far beyond that's not even
[1:20:40] real think where did they come up with
[1:20:43] it they took their eyes off a Vindicated
[1:20:45] word a Vindicated Prophet they begin to
[1:20:48] say surely I know he but he's gone now
[1:20:50] so uh we we're in charge now yes no
[1:20:55] listen to
[1:20:56] this the very thing that happens do you
[1:20:59] know brother bam said the one thing
[1:21:02] that's we that that we we're not
[1:21:04] following they say we're following a
[1:21:06] man listen when I sat there and I have
[1:21:09] to be honest I'm going this is a
[1:21:10] confession in 1965 when I walked into
[1:21:13] the service this is my
[1:21:17] testimony I i' never heard after I was
[1:21:19] 15 years old I heard him but I didn't
[1:21:21] understand he was a prophet at all but
[1:21:23] when I was 23 years old I'd been saved
[1:21:25] and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:27] and I sat and heard brother bradam and
[1:21:30] he began to as he begin to preach I was
[1:21:32] sitting there
[1:21:34] oh Dar Denise I was sitting there I
[1:21:38] about like
[1:21:39] that and I and I was listening to him
[1:21:42] and it was in the Tabernacle and he
[1:21:44] started to said I'm going to take my
[1:21:47] text he said and my text this morning is
[1:21:49] running or this evening is running from
[1:21:51] the presence of the Lord
[1:21:55] and I started
[1:21:56] crying not bad but just I couldn't keep
[1:22:00] tears back and I sat and listened and he
[1:22:03] preached and he preached and I couldn't
[1:22:05] understand the
[1:22:06] attraction until later on I
[1:22:09] understood he said you're not looking at
[1:22:12] a
[1:22:13] man it's the pillar of fire that's
[1:22:15] returned again that's the one why do we
[1:22:18] have it why do we have the picture of
[1:22:20] the pillar of fire he said it's not a
[1:22:22] picture of me it's a picture of the Holy
[1:22:25] Ghost identified with my Ministry he
[1:22:27] said and and I didn't realize till later
[1:22:29] on that that's what it was when wisdom
[1:22:31] and knowledge understanding begin to
[1:22:32] come I realized it was it was the pillar
[1:22:35] of fire that was attracting me it still
[1:22:38] attracting me it's the pillar of fire
[1:22:40] that's leading us today he hasn't gone
[1:22:42] yet the prophet said when he goes we go
[1:22:44] with him we do not Jesus does not come
[1:22:47] down to earth to take us he's already
[1:22:49] he's here this is his
[1:22:51] presence this is what separates us from
[1:22:53] the world this is what separates from
[1:22:55] unbelief is his message to go meet the
[1:22:57] Lord in the air yes sir amen I love ones
[1:23:00] will come up first we know that there's
[1:23:02] no argument
[1:23:04] there but I do believe that the
[1:23:08] Supreme
[1:23:10] God gives Supreme Grace for the Supreme
[1:23:14] hour thank you Lord if rapturing faith
[1:23:17] of the Dead raised this
[1:23:19] morning and we need rapturing faith in
[1:23:22] 40 days or
[1:23:23] so it's going to be
[1:23:26] there I believe we've got it now amen
[1:23:30] say well I I'm not don't even look at
[1:23:32] that I'm I'm a preacher that I hate to
[1:23:35] say look at things that what I I thought
[1:23:37] I what I think I
[1:23:39] am stop thinking what you are and start
[1:23:41] saying what God said you were I trust
[1:23:44] his word way more than my own
[1:23:46] thinking because I know the devil has an
[1:23:49] Avenue to come into me and try to tempt
[1:23:50] me and say well you did this you did
[1:23:52] that that that's my flesh and Paul said
[1:23:54] when I want to do good evil is present
[1:23:56] and the things I would not I do so I
[1:23:59] find a law then and as long as we're in
[1:24:02] this body there's the law of the flesh
[1:24:04] to be tempted and tried and
[1:24:06] tested but how else would there be a
[1:24:09] victory but how else would there be an
[1:24:12] overcomer how else would there be
[1:24:14] somebody standing on the earth that's an
[1:24:15] overcomer if there wasn't trials and
[1:24:16] tests and
[1:24:18] temptations we ought to thank God for
[1:24:20] the trials and the tests I know do it
[1:24:23] just like we Grumble a little bit and
[1:24:24] then we
[1:24:26] think it's much easier if it just comes
[1:24:28] so nice all the time the blessings of
[1:24:31] God but you know he knows just what we
[1:24:33] need he might put a little pressure on
[1:24:35] one and and less on another one and re
[1:24:38] me say well I know so and so why they've
[1:24:40] got nothing they just thinks everything
[1:24:41] goes right with them and then the other
[1:24:44] one seems like nothing goes right with
[1:24:45] them trouble after trouble after
[1:24:49] trouble I said well I'm glad I'm not the
[1:24:51] captain of the ship
[1:24:55] but I believe there is one that
[1:24:57] is the great
[1:24:59] Shepherd you know there's a little song
[1:25:01] that I I like to sing the ship of
[1:25:05] Zion can I get the musicians up
[1:25:09] here amen I'm going to
[1:25:11] close but I'm going to sing this little
[1:25:13] song the ship of
[1:25:16] Zion yeah I don't know if you ever heard
[1:25:18] it I was standing on the banks of the
[1:25:21] river
[1:25:22] looking out over life's troubled
[1:25:25] sea and I saw an old ship that was
[1:25:28] sailing It's The Old Ship of Zion that I
[1:25:32] see this is the one
[1:25:35] that this Gospel
[1:25:38] Ship is the good news to an elect lady
[1:25:42] could you imagine if all of the
[1:25:44] revelation we hold in our hearts today
[1:25:47] would just bounce on us in one
[1:25:49] time there is no way we we'd lose our
[1:25:52] mind for sure and and we we'd be Rapture
[1:25:55] bound we we'd be out of
[1:25:57] here I've had 50 years of laying the
[1:26:00] presence of this word line upon line go
[1:26:03] read it again read it again it's always
[1:26:05] find out never changes right only gets a
[1:26:08] little more of
[1:26:09] it gets a little bit better you get to
[1:26:12] see it a little clearer said oh my just
[1:26:15] last night I was listening brother was
[1:26:17] describing the two births he said you
[1:26:20] know what Abram was looking for
[1:26:23] was a city whose Builder and maker was
[1:26:25] God Amen he was looking for that which
[1:26:28] we should have come we shouldn't have
[1:26:29] come by sex really we were to come by
[1:26:33] the spoken word that's but then God
[1:26:35] allowed that and all the attributes that
[1:26:38] were in him could be expressed over
[1:26:39] 6,000 years and the first 6,000 he built
[1:26:43] all of it and the second th000 he's had
[1:26:45] Satan to build his Eden cuz he said he's
[1:26:47] going to build a better one than what
[1:26:48] Christ could build so he said all right
[1:26:50] Build It come on but Satan didn't know
[1:26:52] that all the attributes that were in him
[1:26:55] were able to keep that which were
[1:26:57] committed unto him all that he had in
[1:27:00] him was going to come anyhow how did we
[1:27:02] come spiritually by the spoken word yes
[1:27:05] sir we didn't come by natural just
[1:27:06] joining church or coming here we're not
[1:27:08] church members we're word members born
[1:27:11] of the word of God by the holy
[1:27:13] spirit amen I believe that to be the
[1:27:15] truth I believe that we're born of the
[1:27:17] spirit of God we're not of this world
[1:27:19] and Abraham was looking for that body
[1:27:21] that
[1:27:22] would change and he could walk into that
[1:27:26] Dimension that he was supposed to come
[1:27:28] by he was tempted like we
[1:27:31] are backs made mistakes along the
[1:27:34] way then God picks him and said yeah
[1:27:38] you're my Chosen One amen I'm going to
[1:27:39] make a new covenant with
[1:27:41] you I've already done it Abraham just
[1:27:45] just get in the way step right out here
[1:27:47] cuz I've already done it and you'll
[1:27:50] notice it as I unfold it yeah you'll see
[1:27:53] that's me right but your
[1:27:56] seed which was Christ amen and when
[1:28:00] Christ came when he is the only one that
[1:28:03] could say I am he come on he's the only
[1:28:06] one that could say that all them had
[1:28:08] thus sayith the Lord but Jesus never
[1:28:09] said thus sayith the Lord he said I say
[1:28:11] unto you because he was the fullness of
[1:28:13] the godhead body now look at him return
[1:28:16] here again this last day when those
[1:28:18] Seven Seals were open the mystery of
[1:28:19] Christ was made known it wasn't a man
[1:28:22] right it was thus sayeth the Lord a
[1:28:24] prophet again son of man but this one
[1:28:27] was greater cuz the first time since
[1:28:30] Paul was struck down by the pillar of
[1:28:31] fire for the first time since that time
[1:28:34] that Pillar of Fire from out behind that
[1:28:35] Mercy Seat come and became visible again
[1:28:38] on Earth here as a confirmation that
[1:28:42] this message was not of
[1:28:43] man it was God almighty God this message
[1:28:48] won't fall
[1:28:50] short The Messengers gone but his
[1:28:53] message lives on
[1:28:56] amen amen let
[1:29:04] me on the
[1:29:07] banks of the
[1:29:10] river looking out over
