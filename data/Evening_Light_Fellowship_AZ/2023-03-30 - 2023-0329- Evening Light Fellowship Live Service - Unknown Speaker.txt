tonight the difference is the blood amen there's a veil that covers Us it's not about how pretty you can make the sacrifice the difference was the blood amen it's just we have a lot of written requests here and I know there's requests that were not pinned I'm going to read these and then we'll sing that one more time as brother Ron comes he's going to give us an update and take the knees before the Lord sister Nancy Tempe has turned in several requests here our first one is for Healing Touch for my uncle who's back in the hospital with congestive heart failure and looks like fluid on his lungs her second is a friendly friend requests prayer for her son and his wife for a situation to get solved with their new neighbor and thirdly she has an unspoken request so we just want to remember that just and also for you know this is true Christian because sister Nancy has great needs in her life let's not open this paper [Music] God help us all sister Fiona Walters is having surgery Friday and we're praying the Lord gives the surgeon's hand and a quick recovery Amen to that this is from Brother Tom Yazzie right before service please remember my mom Effie in prayer I just got a text from her saying she might be flown out to Cottonwood hospital tonight or tomorrow so God knows that need we place it in his hand please remember sister Jennifer it looks like Dubose in Florida I believe she's a streamer and she needs a Special Touch for her and her husband uh this is from Sister Tara Traub please pay for my grandpa Douglas he got stung by a stingray three weeks ago and it hasn't healed tomorrow he begins one of multiple surgeries on his foot I just know the Lord is mindful of that sister Jennifer and brother Matt Clayville had turned in a it's a praise report and attached to a request here this morning our work was informed that they were shutting down the Scottsdale facility where we worked with 841 people and they all lost their jobs we were informed because we work from home we get to keep our job we thank and praise the Lord for his meeting our needs and watching over us please pray God is with those that did lose their jobs God is our Jehovah Jireh and we rest in that on the way here tonight they had the road shut down and just seen a motorcycle on the road and just you know just those kind of things you just Lord just have mercy so just remember this gentleman that was in this motorcycle accident the Lord just have mercy on him and then also I just wrote some requests on our hearts here brother Johan looks like he's home but still recovering so just Lord be with him and brother Ron will give a update on brother Neil Mater continue to remember Sister Rebecca page uh little Josiah McGrady Theo was able to have a um his treatment this week his ANC numbers were really good 6 000 is better than this ever been so we're very thankful for that knowing the Lord is doing the work and then I know some of y'all familiar with brother Terry tidwell's music Ministry his wife Vicki a lot of people don't know this she's been battling a form of cancer for 10 years and they did everything they can do with their platelets and they can't get the numbers back up because at some point your body just rejects them and they told her there's nothing else we can do and that's okay because when the doctors say we're done I believe Jesus Takes Over I rest in that I believe it and brother Johnny Reynolds had his open heart surgery and uh brother Ron could probably give a little update on that as well but just praying the Lord be with him and continue to just touch him and lift him up it's a lot of needs but you know what like brother Patterson says all the time the Lord is faithful to Deliver Us from all of them let's just sing that again as brother Ron comes oh peace of God [Music] Lord cover me oh peace of God [Music] oh peace of God cover me cover me [Music] cover me [Music] peace of God cover me all through the storm he'll cover me for it's only in you I am safe you believe that oh it's only you I'm secured Lord It's Only in here we find peace Soul cover me full coverage he'll do it friends come understand [Music] and cover me cover me [Music] God bless you all this evening I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ couple things that I want to make an announcement on before I go into the prayer request what a tremendous time of the moving of the spirit we had on Sunday God moved in a sovereign way you saw it from the beginning of the service all the way to the end there and I want to say I was supposed to have a board meeting right after the service and my nominees and different ones and and their wives and I went and I told uh brother Chris I said brother Chris canceled the meeting of the board he heard cancel the meeting did some of you wonder why he came up here and kind of kind of shut it down oh my so I called him up I said brother Chris did did you did you unders he said all I heard was cancel the meeting he he you know I said oh my I said I am so sorry brother Chris I take that responsibility but let me tell you as a pastor when we have a moving in the spirit we want to do nothing to squelch it people come up here and pray and we'll have people playing and singing and I want some of our you know whether it's Justin uh dubsky and he's playing and singing I want them to get the experience of feeling that Holy Spirit and holding that that presence there I I'm sorry Saints uh he misunderstood me and he thought I canceled the meeting because I have to have another meeting and and it was my fault and I'm sorry and so but God knows hey huh we all learn he said oh brother Ron he said I'll go up there I said you ain't taking the fall for that one I said that that's on me and I I'm sorry and I truly apologize because I'll tell you what I was so moved that at the end of the service I was absolutely exhausted and I think I in trying to talk to him as I maybe didn't make it clear or whatever and there's people coming in and out and everything but my what a presence we had and I love that and that's what we live for we want to do nothing to quench the spirit of God Amen so I just wanted to make that announcement to you um and also because there was a moving and sometimes you will have the littler kids come up uh and maybe it wasn't a real genuine something on there because I saw him up here and as I'm looking at them there's some that oh genuine you see it oh my spirit of God's movement I'm going to leave it up to the parents you make a judgment on whether or not that little one that came up here is ready and because the Bible says repent and be baptized okay it's just not following the crowd it's doing what and yet if the parents say no it was genuine then what doth hinder because about even if you baptize them early it don't hurt them but if we deny them and as a genuine deal you you could hurt their little spirit and then they say well why wouldn't they let me do it see okay so that's back on appearance Sunday morning after the service we're going to have a baptismal and I got people coming from out of state too that we're streaming that their kids were so moved they said we're we're coming down just for the baptism amen praise the Lord so up update on brother Neil um we did go ahead and I had sister Linda send out kind of a a message to everyone he is in intensive care unit that means that really there should only be no more than two if sister Karen's in there she can have two more uh besides her that could go ahead and and visit but again when you go in there very quick hello uh you know and and just tell them you're praying for him and you love him type thing and um uh so you got that that no brother Neil is not out of critical situation right now I'm asking God to continue they call him a miracle man and every day he is he's we see some things will raise up it seems like a roller coaster we'll we'll get uh really good news and then it seems like a couple steps back but that's okay hey our God can do when the doctors say we're done we have a higher court of appeal I thank God brother Branham had so many people come through Doctors Don't Give You Up he said but God has heard your prayer tonight huh nothing will stand in your way not even cancer so uh be praying for brother Neil he uh he got a port an ivy port instead of a temporary they've had these Temporaries they went left and right they put a port in the shoulder here so that they don't have to do that and uh you know it just come out or whatever and um but is there anything else Sister Sarah that I need to make the people but uh anyway uh if you do go see him you make sure that you remember it's ICU Intensive Care Unit and that you call Sister Karen if he's in a procedure if they're doing something where you shouldn't be there they'll tell you to wait and then you can go to the waiting room and then they'll let you know okay but let's let's lift him up let's keep our prayers up right and all of these other prayer requests we're going to ask God to come on the scene and that same God even as uh uh brother Dave Pollock said brother Ron I believe God is doing so I believe it's a beginning of a Revival uh brother Branham said every every uh generation is Promised their Revival so that means our kids and our grandkids as many as the Lord Our God shall call and so I believe that God is doing something not only here but universally globally around the world he's getting his bride ready a Rapture Ready how many of you have a request and say just remember me tonight God bless you let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord you see those hands both of my hands are up father tonight I realize I am a needy person I need you father but it is the need that makes you God because sometimes father when we got no need and and we're just going along and all life is easy and everything we kind of get lethargy we get a little lukewarm we get a little complacent but then it comes on a a need a time and there's a pressure and a stress and it puts us on our knees and father we know that you do that and you you do that that you will keep our lives ready and father you said sometimes it takes desperation to bring God on the scene but you're always there you know every purpose you know everything that we go through and father I commit this service these prayer requests our brother Neil uh little Josiah little Theo each and every one that has a need whether it be spiritual or physical we just claim that you're Jehovah Jireh in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you Brother David you may be seated brother Elias savola if you'll get ready we're going to sing a song we practiced if you know this

that God will he'll take you through amen he'll be with you even in you until the end of the world Amen we have certainly a pleasure tonight to have our brother Andrew Glover I've never heard him in person before we met before many years ago at brother Donnie Reagan's I believe he he said I come in there little he was a little boy about eight nine years old and I yeah he was probably taller than

Andrew it's a pleasure to have you here my brother we greet you and welcome you in the name of the Lord his wife sister Mariah and their son Malachi is here sister where where are you sister raise your hand raise your hand there you are in the back back row she's hiding way back there and anyway Sister Mariah their son Malachi we had uh we had lunch with him today and we certainly enjoyed it and enjoyed his spirit so uh you know brother Branham said if you get the people to believe and our theme song is only believe can we go ahead and give me the chord to that song only believe and we'll do that as our uh see the voice of God did not leave no sir when the prophet left spirit of God did not leave he's still here he's God in Murphy changes his mask you believe that amen and I just believe that God right now is working in and through his bride amen because the final voice he said to the final age is the bride of Christ and I'm just glad to be a part of that oh only believe [Music] oh we believe all things are possible only believe [Music] oh maybe [Music] all things are possible only [Music] We Believe Lord I receive the Lord I received the Lord I receive all things are possible the Lord I receive oh Lord I receive thank you Lord I receive all things are possible Lord I receive D amen truly we believe that's possible tonight Amen to receive whatever the desire of your heart is we've been taught by a prophet of God that before there was a creation there was a Creator amen before there was a fan on the fish's back there was a water for it to swim in and before there was a tree there was an Earth for it to grow out of and I love how the prophet of God says it before there was a desire in your heart to receive the Holy Ghost there was a holy ghost for you to receive it amen I believe that he's here tonight to make good every promise of his word how many will agree with me tonight that he's here amen let's just buy our hearts together tonight as we approach him and let's just invite him to come and speak to us Heavenly Father Lord as your believer said give it here on this Wednesday afternoon Lord we have not come here tonight out of former fashion we've not come out of ritual or tradition Lord but father we're here because there is a deep calling to the Deep Lord at the at the noise of the water spouts there is a living God who can answer the desires and Lord as we come in your house tonight father we have not come to be seen or to be heard but Lord we we have come for one purpose and that is to entertain your presence for lord your Prophet said when your presence is recognized and your power is released and Lord I pray that across this congregation tonight that Faith Lord would raise to a level Lord to recognize your presence Lord father while the word is going forth May sicknesses be healed Lord father while the word is going forth may change be broken o God or may those who are bound may they be set free into the Glorious Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free Lord I pray for those that have a desire to be here tonight but Lord for some reason they can't be I pray Lord you would go in their homes may you go in the hospitals wherever they would be Lord may you minister to him as only you can and Lord whatever is accomplished here tonight we'll be sure to stand back and to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for truly Lord with you we can do all things without you we can do nothing so Lord come and be the speaker here tonight come and speak through me hear through the Believers Lord and may we be benefited and edified by our gathering together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen God richly bless you this evening we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and while you're staying with us if you have your Bibles you can be turning with us we have a few places we'd like to look tonight we want to turn to the Book of Jeremiah the first chapter uh first and while we're turning there we want to greet you all on behalf of our pastor brother Sean Martin the Saints there at Faith Tabernacle in Blacksburg Virginia uh send their greetings to you as well this evening and we sure counted an honor and privilege to be here with you all this evening and to be with brother Ron and sister Sandy we sure enjoyed the fellowship today and I tell you it's a real honor to be together with the bride of Jesus Christ and looking across the congregation I see many familiar faces so I'm not going to start trying to call names so we just say God bless you all this evening but I am going to say it's good to see brother Lindsay amen is a bit of a surprise when I pulled up and saw you getting out of the car and I thought why in the world is Lindsey McGrady here and then it dawned on me he's got family here so amen it sure is good to see you and Sharon God bless you all and been knowing brother Lindsay man he's been hearing me and knowing me preaching I first started in one of the first places we ministered was in his assembly and we sure appreciate brother and sister McGrady and sure glad to have my wife here with me this evening and our little boy Malachi and I'll just tell you like I tell everybody if you haven't seen him yet hold on you'll hear him in a few minutes hey man so we we're sure glad to have them here with us this evening and we want to look here in the book of Jeremiah the first chapter and the fourth verse Jeremiah the first chapter in the fourth verse the Bible says then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I form thee in thy belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations then said I ah Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord and then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth behold I have put my words in thy mouth so it was not the words of Jeremiah it was the words of God now watch see I have this day set thee over the Nations over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw down to build and to plant so the words that was coming in Jeremiah's mouth had the power to tear down to root out to destroy Amen to throw down but those same words had the power to build up and to plant amen we want to also look in the Book of Daniel the ninth chapter The Book of Daniel the ninth chapter and I pray you forgive me for reading so many scriptures here in opening but just a few things here on my heart I pray the Lord help us to tie together and Daniel the ninth chapter we know that the Book of Daniel is like the Book of Revelation in the New Testament it's a book of symbols and you come here to the ninth chapter and in the first verse it says in the first year of Darius the son of assurance of the seed of the medes which was made King over the realm of the Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign now watch this Daniel understood my books the number of the years were of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet Jeremiah was ordained a prophet the Jeremiah the prophet and he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem now whatever he was reading had an impact on him because the very next verse says and I set my face into the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes so whatever he was reading in those books moved him into desperation before God now the last place I want to look with you is in the New Testament John the 15th chapter John the 15th chapter and I want to pull the word from Jeremiah 1. of ordained to John 15 and verse 16. and Jesus here is speaking of the the vine the branches and he says in the 16th verse now ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon for just a few moments I want to about the help of the Lord and if I title this sermon tonight I want to speak to you on ordained to the message by the spirit ordained to the message by the spirit I I believe the hour has come uh to preach the people of God into higher Heights and deeper depths of the love of God of the knowledge of God of the revelation of God and of the word that he has sent us in this hour I believe that the time has come Amen to bring a stability to the Church of the Living God and the only thing that can bring a stability to the believer is the word right that's the only thing that will bring a stability to the believer is the word now the prophet of God said is we ministers he said we are to establish the people think of it as today he said we don't try to establish the word of God in the people's hearts he said we're trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart but we are commanded to establish the word of God Amen we are commanded Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of man but I I come to you in the power in the manifestation of the Holy Ghost that your faith might rest in God so Paul amen was not placing your faith on him he was placing your faith in his word that's why Peter would come along and say I would not you be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them amen but be established in present truth now we all know that there is a past there is a present and there is a future amen and Paul here is saying or Peter Heather he's saying amen be established Amen in the present truth now where the Lord begin to deal with my heart on this sermon I was reading here and heard this quote and does God ever change his mind about his word brother man was actually ordaining some brothers to the ministry and he says here anybody know brother Merlin Anthony he is new to me oh with the Salvation Army oh yes from the Salvation Army that's right I remember him sure I know him his face didn't look familiar but I know him see he's a man of God he said now how many believes that God is working with him raise your hand amen will you pray for him amen now now he says now brother we know that you're coming from a great group of people Salvation Army there are great people they do a great workout on the street we can say nothing against the Nazarene we can say nothing against the Pentecostal church or the Salvation Army or any of them or they're our Brethren but you see we believe that we are carriers of a great message for this very hour that we're living in now do you want to do that with us and the brother says amen amen now I find it amazing when you study through those ordinations of a prophet he's making it very clear that he's not ordaining these men to preach denominational Doctrine he's not ordaining them amen to be a continuation of the Salvation Army or the Pentecostals or the Nazarene but he's ordaining them amen to preach Christ as he has been revealed through this end time message and I I'll say it as plain as I know how amen this message has brought Christ back in the church I mean amen it's not a bunch of laws it's not a bunch of dues it's not a bunch of adults amen but it is the power of the resurrected Lord Jesus amen in the midst of his church in the the age that we're living in therefore amen I don't believe that God through a prophet was just ordained him Amen brother Merlin Anthony or any of them other ministers there that he was praying for but I believe amen that this ordination went beyond just a Ministry amen but it coming to a bride therefore amen we have not been ordained upon the Earth to be a continuation of some Society or a continuation amen of some man's idea but we have been ordained by the spirit amen to be a carrier of this end time message from God the prophet of God said speaking to Moses he said talk about persevering well he walks right up there in the face of pharaoh and he said let them go see he had talked face to face with God Amen until he had his commission and I think if Minister brother today should not take it from an intellectual standpoint but would find them a place on the backside of the desert on those sacred Sands where Satan cannot place his dirty feet of unbelief and stay there until a message comes from God and positionally places you in the ministry then all that Devils out of Torment could not shake you from him amen you know you are called now watch a prophet turn it from the ministry and say I think each Christian ought to do that before you come out and confess the Holy Ghost confess the baptism there ought to be such a personal contact with God Amen until all the intellectuals in the world could not explain it from you amen because you know you've been there you've had the witness you know it's so amen what did Jesus tell his disciples he said go wait into city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power not from the bishop amen not from the Cardinal but from on high amen then where was the power coming from the power amen was coming from the Holy Ghost it was coming from heaven and may I announced to you tonight that we are not here amen are helpless hopeless confused amen weak beat down powerless bunch of church members amen but the same power that filled the upper room amen has returned into the Church of the Living God Amen and it hasn't come by the Baptist Doctrine hasn't come by the Pentecostal Doctrine but it has come by first save the evening time message listen friends we are not carrying a bunch of Creeds we are not caring about your dogmas we are carrying body changing power amen that some morning between six and nine amen the very atoms of our bodies are going to be changed well I might as well preach I'm here amen the time to preach this message is not coming it's here amen the time to enjoy the blessings of the Holy Ghost it's not coming it is here people say well someday somehow or sometime amen but I say if not now then when and somebody said well somebody I say if not you amen then who amen there's not another age coming there's not another message coming there's not another Prophet coming you are the final voice to the final age amen underneath your messenger oh I say oh God fill us with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost or we can't do nothing amen but give our lives to this end time message amen give our families to it give our Ministries to give everything we are to this message friends amen I don't want to hurt your feelings but I got to say what brother Brown said I am responsible for a message and that message he has come out of this mess the message of the hour has come out of this mess and if I ask you to come out then where am I going to take you to see if I would take it at random Tabernacle he said it's as much fault as he and the rest of them but there's only one place I know I can take you that it is safe and protected from death and he said that's in Jesus Christ which is God's place of worship listen I'm not carrying you tonight amen out into the Realms of emotion I'm not carrying you tonight out into the Realms of feelings or Sensations or gifts amen but let the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost amen lift you up into a dimension with this word where you can see what a prophet's saying and Faith Can strike your heart and say if he said it I believe it that sales it and I'm going to claim it and there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough devils in this room there ain't enough Spirits against me behind me or around me that will defeat a centered daughter of God on their way to meet promise of God let me just go ahead and say it you didn't stumble in this message you was ordained to it you didn't stumble into this church you was ordained to it you didn't stumble underneath the teachings of a word Prophet you Dane to this message now I love what Jeremiah says there he said before I form thee God says I knew thee in the belly and before thou camest forth have a womb amen I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations look at this word ordained it means to give it means to bestow it means to Grant it means to permit subscribe employee devote consecrate amen dedicate commit and trust or to give over amen so God is telling Jeremiah before I ever even informed you in the womb of your mother amen I gave you to a message amen before I ever brought you out of the womb of your Earthly mother I ordained you amen a prophet to the name listen God did not wait till Jeremiah was born and come down in the birthing room and say man he looks like a prophet amen man he looks like somebody that'll do something for me amen but before there was one Adam or one molecule Amen in the back part of God's mind amen Jeremiah was already laying there amen just waiting for the time of manifestation and may I say that same predestination did not stop at Jeremiah and it didn't stop at Paul and it didn't stop it William Branham but that same ordination of God has followed you into this age and it coming to you by a gene seed amen your father didn't have nothing to do with it amen your mother didn't have nothing to do with it amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen placed a seed on the inside of your soul and ordained you for a Time such as man y'all got to forgive me there's a preaching anointing in here tonight amen it's a Time Amen to believe this message amen you you are not a trespasser amen when the Holy Ghost comes in your services and starts moving like her brother Ron was talking about amen you ain't got to stay on the outside of that amen that's a sovereign move of the almighty God Amen you got rights in the Holy Ghost you got rights to have hands wait on you you got rights to have Devils cast out of you you got rights to speak the word you got rights to believe God still heals cancer oh you got rights in the Holy Ghost amen because before you was ever even brought here God said he knew you he Sanctified you amen said before he ever come from his mother's womb in other words Jeremiah was born on the Earth for a specific purpose he was not born for a haphazard purpose he was born a purpose now in John 1 12 the Bible said as many as received him Amen to them gave him power thank you brother to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name now watch how they were born not of blood or of the will of Flesh nor the will of man but of God now I don't have time to take you through all the scriptures that shows you God's people they've been born for a specific purpose amen but brother Branham said Moses was born for a specific purpose he said his specific purpose was to deliver Israel from the bondage of the Egyptian do you realize Israel had a specific purpose upon their life and that was they would have the cleanest bloodstream amen for out of that bloodstream brother Warren amen would come the Messiah amen now we can leave Moses and Israel and we can come to Jesus and he said no man can come to me except the father draws him first see it's nothing you can do about it amen Jesus didn't come to Calvary he meant to die for a haphazard purpose he didn't come there and say well maybe I'll die and it'll be so pathetic some people will see that I died and maybe they'll come and serve the Lord no Jesus came for a specific purpose Amen to redeem those who God by for now that's elected to come to him listen Jesus didn't go to Calvary by accident amen Jesus didn't stumble amen up on Mount Calvary amen by just some coincidence amen but before the foundation of the world Amen four thousand years in the mind of God he was the lamb that was slain from before the foundation of the world Amen remember said it took four thousand years amen for that vision of the Lamb being slain Amen to come into materialization he said but it came and he said the same vision has been spoken over the church listen I don't know how long it'll take amen for Visions to materialize amen but you better back every devil up in the corner and remind that devil it's going to happen no matter if it's four minutes four hours four days four months four years or for a thousand years amen what God has determined will be accomplished well it's not of him that willeth it's not of him that runeth but it is God that showeth Mercy then I can say it like this Moses had a specific purpose amen amen Israel had a Pacific purpose amen Jesus had a specific purpose well let's bring it on an evening tonight Fellowship amen you have got a specific purpose amen God did not make you and I just deceived if he could do it he made us for a purpose see you're here for a specific purpose no matter how little you are how big you are how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose just as my finger is here that's my nail on my fingers for a purpose my eye every part of our body is to serve a purpose it was not put here just to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose it was God's divine plan to do so and if you were put here for a purpose amen then there is nothing somebody say nothing amen God bless you brother make it been a long time amen amen there is nothing can destroy amen until God's purpose is fulfilled amen nothing can harm us until the purpose that God has put us here for has been made manifest amen you ought to you ought to write that quote down and read it to the devil every morning you get out of bed amen there is nothing that devil can do amen there's nothing cancer can do there is nothing sickness can do there's nothing Church disagreements can do there's nothing politics or governments or nations amen there's nothing denomination can do Amen to defeat the purpose of God it's the infallible in person it's a perfect purpose and all hell can't defeat him then I'll say it to you like this what God calls you to be you'll be it come on you can run from it but you can't hide amen David said I can make my bed in the belly of Hell amen but he'll be there amen because of God by predestination has wrapped according to prophecy around your soul amen you can't outrun the predestination of God you can't outrun the foreknowledge of God it is sovereign what if God wants a certain thing he said that he brings you to the Earth to be that and you'll be it amen he brings you to the Earth to be that and you'll be it see if he called you to do a thing then when my God calls he calls by a Divine call when God calls you he calls you by a Divine call I said like this then God called you and ordained You by his spirit amen to this message in first John 1 5 I love what the Bible said this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all see look at this word message it is an announcement it is a promise it is the promise given to be given it is a promised good or blessing amen it is something that has been promised amen being manifested now the prophet of God said why it had to be separate the highest of Heaven came down to make yourself known to the lowest of the earth amen bypassing all them to make himself known to the common herdsmen amen coming to give these common herdsmen amen the greatest message Of All Times amen God bypass Scholars he bypassed nobleman he bypassed he bypassed Kings and monarchs and potentates and learn men amen but here he comes to the lowest amen with the greatest of all messages and you know what that message was it was Messiah is here now amen then the greatest did not choose the best Amen to announce his arrival amen but he bypassed the best and he went over to the hills Amen to Bethlehem Judea and he on some Shepherds out there that were just tending their flocks amen they had no education they had no Fellowship card they had no recognition amen but on the inside of them they had a seed of God that was ordained from the foundation of the world Amen and that seed was ordained to do one thing it was not to be this or to be that it was to stand in the face of humanity and declare Messiah is here now let me just go and say it amen Our God didn't go to Bob Jones and he didn't go to Liberty University and he didn't go to the best societies amen but he come down to a bunch of nobodies amen who was born in sin shaping inequity he was on the road to Hell come on he took drug dealers and prostitutes Amen in serious psychotic people and he changed them by the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost amen and put him into a position by the authority of the Holy Ghost Amen to announce to this lost and Dying World the Messiah is here and if he's here then he's here to do something he's here to save he's here to heal he's here to deliver he's here to bring the captive out of captivity oh God past the nobodies God bypassed the nobodies and come down to some oh my my pastor somebody's come to nobody's to declare the key message you say what is this key message it is the announcement that God is not dead it is the announcement that God is not dead then the prophet said the layout of sin age my I'm trying to lay a foundation he always preaching me the layout of sin age is supposed to receive a message he said see in Malachi 4 said they would then can I say what a prophet said he said we as this group of people we have a message for this day and we believe that God has given us a message that we are not looking for a message we have on we are not looking for something to follow we have been ordained to follow the leadership of the Vindicated word now people sometimes say what is this you mean amen by the message of the hour well thank god a prophet defined it he said what they are getting at is it's God's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do the message of the hour is God's promise of what he promised he would do in this hour recognize your Danish message don't you see the message of the hour can you recognize where we are the message itself the message itself from the scripture interprets to you the hour that we're living in amen last time he preaches modern events made clear by prophecy what does he say he said if you want to know what month you're in look at the calendar if you want to know what age you're in look at the Bible amen the calendar is a sign of the natural time amen but the Bible is the spiritual announcement of the age you're living now come on church amen because we didn't know where we were that we didn't know where we were going we didn't know where we come from amen but God rich in Mercy amen new there was a people on the Earth that would be living in the closing hours of time when Time and Eternity would be blending together and there would be at this house can I say it to you like this the desire to see Jesus would return to the church that would be why what did he preach over and over amen search we would see Jesus amen why because Zacchaeus amen desired to see him right he said what did Zacchaeus do amen he climbed up a sycamore tree and he said where did he go he found where there were two limbs that come together and he met at the truck of the tree and there he sat down he said now that's a good place to sit amen were two ways meet he said that's yours and gods amen your idea and his amen can I say this amen this church is a good place to sit down and let your ideas and God's ideas meet come on Amen a good Wednesday night service it's a good place to sit down amen under the auspices of the revealed word of the hour that you're living in under the anointing of the music under the anoints of the preaching it's a good place to sit down and let your ideas come across God's ideas amen your own thoughts about him and what his word says He is amen what you think he is and what the word says he is I love this one brother Ron what the message of the hour is to your own thinking and what the message of the hour is to his word now I know a lot of people got a lot of different ideas about what the message is and what I have found amen is there not always God's word ideas they're their own ideas but the difference is amen is it coming from the word or is it coming from your ideas now let's just say what brother Branham said he said we've not come together to talk about the message but we are come together to get in the message see and the message is Christ come on it's not a book it's not a belt buckle it's not a replica of a briefcase it's not a museum the message is Christ I know men have reduced it down to doctrines amen but the message is Christ I know they've reduced it down to little points to fuss and argue on Amen but young people don't you ever forget this message amen is not an argument it's not a debate it's not a bunch of preachers it's not a bunch of personalities this message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I can hear the prophet's voice as he screams out my commission to this earth it's the forerun the coming word which will prepare the bride amen for the second going of the church of living listen friends we're not going to stay here I know things are hard right now I know times are difficult right now amen but get your eyes off of time get your eyes off a situation get your eyes off of circumstances and get your eyes back on this message and let it refresh you let it renew you let it revive you hallelujah it's the message of the hour and I think we ought to lay out for red carpet and welcome it back in our churches well brother Andrew you're getting too far out there I don't think I got far enough yet the message is Christ I'll go to the farthest limb of the tree to scream it the message is Christ now the prophet said that if he is the word then what are we to do we're to get into it laughs so the message is Christ and we're to get into the message now the next part is one I love he says get beneath it so when you get in the message you're not standing next to it is this okay you're not standing above it trying to add your ideas to it but you're getting beneath it in other words it's become your headship it's become your compass it's become your direction it's become your vision it's become your focus see when we get beneath it that's what we're supposed to do now the prophet said that the message is Christ and Christ is the word and God is his word now the prophet of God tells us amen that God then is perfected in threes right he said father son Holy Ghost water blood spirit God is perfected in threes then I love the way we see this amen that the message which is Christ has come to the church amen in three pulls is that okay has come to the church in three pools now I did a study some time ago and I don't have time to give it to you all right now but I just want to preach it from my heart he said it like this is this a sign of the unserved he said now is this that third pull that he told me three or four years ago see the first pull you remember what happened I tried to explain it and he said don't do it he said then the second poll don't try and I put anyhow then he said now there's a third pool coming now say that with me a third pull comment he said now there's a third pull coming but don't try to explain it you see how I approached this tonight I don't know but I feel Duty bound to my church to say something and you draw your own conclusion now watch him turn and say the works that I do amen more than this how you do he said King James says greater but you couldn't do nothing greater he said what was it it was more of it he said see he was in one person then he's in the whole church now amen back then he was in one person doing the works of the father amen but now he has come into a body a Church of the Living God he said if this is the third pull amen then there is a great ministry line ahead I don't know I can't say I don't know so right there he identifies he meant the third pull is coming and if this is the third pool that's coming there's a great ministry lying ahead then he comes to the indictment and says may there come forth a Revival of the just and a great power come among the church just before it's going it's not hard to pray that amen because you promised it can I just stop here and say this amen we don't have to beat a Revival out of this carpet come on we don't come on church we don't have to be the Revival out of this altar amen we don't have to pull a Revival out of midair somewhere amen but there's a Revival in the word amen the bride's Revival it's not a Revival of singing It's not a Revival of just emotion the bride's Revival is a word Revival come on y'all know what I'm talking about they've been this bride's Revival Burns in the darkest of nights this bride's Revival Burns amen when the bills are paid and when you're in the negative this bride's Revival Burns amen when you're well and it burns when you're sick amen because it's not a Revival amen can I preach a minute it's not a Revival amen that is controlled by the thermostat of the conditions of the church and then the church might be cold but if you got this word on the inside of your soul it'll break out on a Wednesday night if you got this word inside of you you can receive the darkest and darkest reports and in the middle of the darkest child of your life this revival will break out in you and it'll be a whale spring it up it'll be joy unspeakable it'll be full of Glory it'll be fire in the cold season come on it's the word come on that's why we can show up and can't have our favorite singer and we're still in Revival well I feel good that's why we can show up amen and not have our fancy playing and still have Revival because the Revival is in the word so the the prophet said it's not hard to pray for that because you promised it see we're looking for that third pull third pull coming third pool will do great things we're looking for that third pull see watch this we know it'll do great things in our midst 1963 why Christ speak God give me courage to take the sword of the word that he put in my hand about 33 years ago and hold it and marched forward to the third pull third pool's coming third pool's going to do great things in our midst great ministry now he's saying amen give me the courage to March towards that third pool Christ The Mystery 1963. of course you being spiritual you watch the spiritual things not knowing this but God knows it if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock it's the end of the second pool the third pool is at hand we have now come from the third pull is coming to when the third pool comes in our midst it's going to do great things we have come from the third pool we're marching towards it but now he's announcing brother Russell we've turned the coroner amen the second pull is over and the third pull is at hand now we can stop there and take those words to Daniel 12 where Daniel was commissioned by the Lord amen seal up the vision Daniel until the time of the end for knowledge shall be increased and many shall run to and fro amen we can go to Revelation 1 3 where John says amen blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein watch for the time he is at hand amen the second pull is now over the third pull is at hand I'm on church amen that third pull amen was sealed in the Revelation amen but it could not come forth until a specific time when there was a specific people that was born for a specific purpose oh I don't I don't know amen I want to scream it out I was born for this third pool I was born for this word I was born for this anointed amen I wasn't born to be a worked up Christian I wasn't born to be up one day and down the next I wasn't born to be on fire one week and call the next but the word has released me from the conditions of society and has led me into the promised land where all things are possible foreign place of power it's a place of authority it's a come on it's the bride's pool it's a bride's pool we got an old brother back home you probably know him brother Lindsay brother Doug he sings an old song he wrote it said the bride speaks a language that the world can't understand I thought oh thank God we speak a different language we speak a language of power we speak a language of stability we speak a language of vision because the time is at hand see he's safe into me still not the Sands of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand now watch we immediately learn a principle that the revelation of God for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time now he says history of Israel the mo that when Moses came specific time Jesus come specific time in this layout of sin age the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter and neither will it be premature glory to God it will not falter and neither will it be be premature for we are in the end time today so now we can say Amen the third pull is coming the third pool will do great things give me courage to March forward to that third poll the third pull is at hand now can we say it like a prophet I feel that third pool is beginning to move you see within me but now watch so now I'm going to say something to you and this is the thing we've looked forward to for so long the third pool has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is he said see only the spiritual will catch the third pool the third pool is properly identified we know where it is come on church amen before he was saying we know it's coming then he said we know it's at hand he said now it's moving within me amen but a prophet didn't walk off the scene amen with the third post sealed in him and for nobody else he said it is so sacred I mustn't say much about it amen but the third pull is here brother the third pull is here he said now watch that third pull it'll be absolutely to the total loss amen but it'll be for the bride for the church amen the third pull will be to the total lost but it will be for the Bride of the church there is no more doubt in my mind I know what the third pull is and I know what the third pull does he said now be revered and be quiet because the hour will soon arrive where God is going to do some great things you say then what is that third pull it's the confirmation of the first pull it's the confirmation of the second pull he said the third poor he said then the spoken word so when the third pull come in the church it was more than just the flesh come on we can preach Body Spirit and Soul by the three pulls amen where was the first pull it was in his flesh where was the second pool it was in the spirit connecting with the spirit realm but where was that third pull brother Robert that third pull was in the soul which the soul is the residency of the word that's why the devil can't defeat you amen because the word of God will defeat the Devil anywhere Anytime Anyplace under any condition amen this third pool is not limited it's the unlimited ride's Revival it's the unlimited anointing it's the unlimited Authority that has come in the church by the spoken word we know what the third pull is can I keep on going we know what the third pull is amen the third pool is that great and final pull he said now watch the very day when this messenger not when he starts out but when he begins to declare his message when he begins to declare his message when he pulls the first time he'll get little fish when he pulls the second time he'll get more little fish but when he makes that third crank when he makes that third pull amen the little fish will scatter amen but the rainbow trout will come and you all know what I'm talking about amen them little fish had to scatter amen cause you all needed some room come on Church them little fish had to go somewhere else amen this seed had to give out of the truck amen because the seed needed some room to be deceived amen that's why we are not carrying Pentecostalism back into this message there was no room for this seed there was no room for this anointing under a Pentecostal idea but underneath a word coming to the word amen all things are possible listen we'll have to wait for a special meeting we don't have to wait for a prayer line we don't have to wait for a special preacher amen but wherever the word has the preeminence there is a possibility to see a miracle there is a possibility to receive an answer come on Church my God is not dead He's Alive and he's well and he's right here with this bride underneath this third pull he said what was that first pool healing second prophesied but now watch that third pull it was the opening of the word brother it was the revealing of the Mysteries and there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word now contrary to popular belief this third pool was not outside the Bible it was in the Bible them seals was in the Bible come on church but it took a prophet to go in that realm and give the anointing what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying the third pull is the message can I get a witness the third pull is the message amen I love to shout and I'll shout right with you but that's not just the message I love to rejoice and I'll Rejoice with you amen but that's not what's bringing stability the third pull is the word it's the message it's what brings us stability what are you saying I'm saying what the prophet said and I've gotten my mind set on this message it's that third pull it's the one I must be loyal in Reverend to then what are you saying I'm saying that the message is the opening of the word in the church which is making it the bride can I say it to you like this you are the bride by the word you are not the bride by the way you feel Austin you are not the bride by the way things are going come on Church you are not the bride by what somebody says about you you are the bride by the word come on persecution can't put you out because persecution didn't put you in critics can't put you out because critics didn't put you in amen naysayers cannot put you out because they did not put you in you was brought into this word by the third pull anointing and the only one that can take you out is the one that put you in and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and the way he's going to take us out is by changing our bodies [Applause] by the word that we're feeding on it's going to change our bodies some morning oh my I I told the devil I was gonna read him something so I'm gonna read it to him right now identify Christ of all ages Heavenly Father we are grateful to see the Risen Messiah 1900 years of all kinds of Theology and movement but still in the darkness of all of it you promise you would appear here yeah in the last days in this Sodom day you would make yourself known to the children of Abraham but called the elected and here you are tonight oh the devil hates this one brother Rod here you are tonight after 1900 years you are just as much alive tonight as you was when you talked to the woman at the well you are just as much alive tonight as you was when you talked to the woman at the well because it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the self same flesh If I Was the Devil I would fight this church too if I was the devil I would fight you too because you have become the word and the word has become your flesh the word is becoming the Flesh and the flesh is becoming the word old church and living God don't you see what it is it's the ordination of God to you to carry this message to be this message the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word and the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride foreign the word in the church making it the bride I can preach here for 20 more minutes the word in the church making it the bride what did the prophet say he said proving his word he said you will take the Rapture by the word now that does something for me brother you will take the Rapture by the word brother Roberts you won't take the Rapture on the way you feel the morning the Rapture takes place Church you may wake up on the mourn the Rapture and feel lower than a snake's belly you may wake up on the morning the Rapture and have a pound and headache and all kinds of troubles in your life all kinds of pressures against you amen and why you're standing in the mirror amen combing your hair and brushing your teeth and facing another day amen you could look in the mirror and see loved ones up here behind you those loved ones are not appearing based on the way you feel they are appearing based on the promise of God's word you will not feel the cold sweep amen based on the way you feel you will feel the cold sweep based on the word that said you would feel it it's God identified himself amen the word in the church the message is the word in the church uh it's the third pull it's the spoken word it's the revealing of the Mysteries it's the appearing of the Lord come on Amen somebody told me not long ago they said brother we got to be careful about this Revelation 10 1. I said you do but I don't they said no we got to be careful brother Andrew I said why they said because we haven't scientifically proven it yet I said what do you mean scientifically proven they said well we've got a God that's a college professor and he's working on proving this proving the cloud by science he said because you know when you introduce it to somebody that's scientific what would you tell them if you introduce the clown to him I said well here's what I'd say I'd say what a prophet said that's our Lord up there he said no no no what would you say I said well I'd say well the prophet said that's our Lord up there he said no no no you got to have something good enough to tell somebody I said if a prophet's words is not good enough to introduce this message by then there's nothing better coming amen but I believe the same Lord that filled Jeremiah's mouth with the words to tear down and to root up and to build out it's the same Lord Jesus that filled the words of William Branham and if he said the word you can take it to the bank it's going to happen because it's the word and I'll say it that's our Lord up there now now that's God coming down to the church identifying himself by the word in the church now you realize that we're living in a time of laodicea right we're living in Laos in time all kinds of people's rights all kinds of captivity all kinds of confusion and brother Brown comes in 1961 and preaches Daniel 70 weeks preachers in three parts first part he says is Gabriel's instructions to Daniel he said then it's the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel he said but then it's the 70th week of Daniel he said that's what ends at all is on that 70th week he said now what we're doing is we're speaking on Daniel in captivity Daniel in captivity and Gabriel flying in to instruct him about the future he's in captivity and God sends the angel Gabriel into captivity to instruct him about the future while Daniel was in prayer Gabriel the Angel come to instruct him now when brother Brown approaches if you study it closely you'll watch him he runs a parallel he'll run Daniel's day our day Daniel's day our day and he turns and says now I am Desiring to preach this amen not to give you a puffed up intellectualism but that you would receive amen the Revelation that would Enlighten the people about the future by the word now I love how Abraham said this he said my wife looked at me and said how do you expect our people which are poor people many of them uneducated like we are to understand such as that I said God will give the answer now I just got to go ahead and preach her for a second amen because I know that little fault that travels around that you can't preach this message to young people amen but I defy that line the name of Jesus Christ this message is Christ and if we can't preach this message to young people then you're telling me you can't preach Christ but I believe if our young people can build computers if they can build software programs I believe they can understand the word of the age they're living in and it can equip them to overcome every devil against them now he said no matter how complicated it is amen God can break it down and make it simple now what I love about this Brotherhood is brother says when Daniel goes into captivity he's about 12 or 14 years old but the Bible said that Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat remember said Daniel was a prophet he said see the words of God the Bible was invested to Daniel to manifest to the people that God still lived the word the Bible the words of God was invested to Daniel to manifest to the people that God still lived and Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile his investment now watch this Daniel's day then parallels our day because Daniel was in a day of confusion Daniel was in Babylon right and Babylon means confusion and the father God said what could you give in exchange in this day of confusion this day when people don't know what to do which way to go the Bible said these days would come there would be a famine in the land not for bread or water but for the hearing the true word of God and the people would go from east to west north to south seeking to hear the true word and here we are privileged tonight to see the message of God the angel of God he said we're living in a day of confusion he said notice this the American and Canadian people he says are the worst confused people in all the world he said the worst confused of all world so can I say it to you like this in other words we're in the end time now I'm I'm tying this together okay we're in the end time and when God comes to an end he does not allow you to come that in without there being a warning in other words before you come to an end there's going to be a warning which is going to be a way to Mark the time you're living in now you can look to the Bible and see that lot he marked his time by Angels Abraham artist by the angel Lord Elohim you know how Rahab martirsched by Messengers but in the days of Daniel it says Daniel Martinez by books foreign come on church it was angels to Sodom it was the angel to Abraham Messengers to Rahab Revelation to Noah but to Daniel and Daniel 9 2 in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by what by books that the number of the years wrote the word the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem look at this word understand it means to discern it means to consider it means to distinguish to have understanding and he says and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting in sackcoff and Ashes so in other words Daniel looked at the time and he discerned the time by the books that he was reading he looked at what was taking place and he discerned the time by the books in other words the books of a Vindicated Prophet Jeremiah amen so anointed Daniel that it moves him into desperation and he began to look at the conditions he began to look at the handwriting on the wall he began to Mark the things the prophet God said now watch he said he went into captivity in BC 606 when the vision came was BC 538 which leaves 68 years he had been in Babylon amongst the heathens he said but he still had the victory 68 years in a heathen land without a church to go to without a song to sing come on young people without a youth camp every other month come on come on adults without a special meet never other week Daniel lived in captivity in 68 years of captivity oh he said but we can't stay an hour but he had the victory in the midst of there with no companions but three and they was in a different part of the Kingdom but Daniel's standing along with God held the victory for 68 years 68 years he kept the victory without the Holy Ghost without the blood of Jesus Christ just the blood of bulls and goats was the only thing Daniel had but he stayed in a place of Victory Daniel no church to go to no songs to sing No Fellowship I love what Barbara says he said but still he held on to what the prophet said now I'm gonna deliver my heart and I'm gonna go out of here are you hearing me he held on to what the prophet said evening Light Fellowship can I encourage you amen whatever you do Amen to hold on to what a prophet said I don't care what a website says I don't care what a Critic says I don't care what your favorite preacher says if it's contrary to what a prophet said you drop it like a hot potato and you get a hold of this Vindicated word it's the only thing that'll Lead You Out of Time into eternity it's the only thing that will change your body it's the only thing that will keep your mind it's the only thing that'll bring prodigals home it's the only thing that'll heal the sick it's the only thing that will raise the dead it's the only thing that'll bring loved ones out of an eternal Dimension into this Dimension is the message of the hour [Applause] oh brother Andrew be careful why should I be careful because before Daniel went into captivity there was a Prophet Jeremiah who was ordained to bring a message and Daniel was ordained to believe that message and he found that message I'm not going to read it to you but it's in Jeremiah 25 he found that message in books two in other words Daniel saw the reality of what he was in by reading Jeremiah's books oh the Lord thank you Jesus now watch this and those books moved him into desperation you know what he had he had a desperate cry you know what he was reading he was reading a Vindicated prophet and a Vindicated Prophet as a way to acknowledge the time you're living in amen from the scriptures and help you identify that time and Daniel took the word of Jeremiah and he goes down into Babylon because he was the anointed Prophet with the word now watch this Daniel goes before God and prays oh man this is powerful it goes but this time is preaching quicker than I can Daniel goes before God and asks him he says Lord will you just show me a little bit Abraham said Gabriel appeared to reveal not only what he was asking about but to tell him all the way down what was determined for the Jewish race all the way to the consummation in other words Daniel went to church on a Wednesday night and said Lord just give me enough to get to Sunday he said oh Lord just give me enough to get by just give me enough I love what program says brother Russell he said he asked a little bit and got the whole thing Daniel just asked God for a little bit and he ended up getting the whole thing old church the Living God don't you see who you are you are in the way of a true prophet and the way of a true Prophet Amen in this last day will proclaim the whole word come on church so I can stand here tonight and say you don't just have to live with a little bit you got the whole thing come on if you stay in the first pool you just got a little bit if you stay in the second pool you just got a little bit but if you come over in this third pool underneath the message of the hour you get the whole thing come on Church come on y'all some of y'all can fellowship with me on this thought when you got saved you was just looking for a freedom from sin you was just looking for a freedom from your past you was looking for freedom from the spirit of condemnation and the guilt that plagued your mind but when you got beneath this message when you got beneath this message you didn't just get forgiveness you didn't just get justification but you got the revelation of predestination you've got the revelation of serpent seed you got the revelation of the Seven Seals you got the revelation of the mystery of God you've got the Revelation the future home you know what Daniel did he come underneath the anointing of Jeremiah's message now I love this next part because when Jeremiah receives this message God tells Jeremiah don't you stay in one place with it he said you take it everywhere he said see Jeremiah took the word of the Lord which was the wine of his word and the wine is the power of His word he said what wine has a power it has an intoxication he said what is wine it is the stimulation of Revelation what is it it's stimulation by drinking the revelation of the word and as you drink it it's bringing a purpose and an understanding now Reverend said like this he said the spirit of wisdom comes in the church makes known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bring in the church in and revealing what they were living in just the same as Gabriel come to Daniel the Holy Ghost has come to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep deep secret things then watch what he says do you understand now can we turn the corner and go home do you understand now brother Andrew what do you mean do you understand now Abraham said in the last days we are given the understanding by the word that we are going to understand it because it'll come to an Ephesian age now watch this and we're here you know what the Bible says who so readth let him understand and in the last days under the third poll the understanding by the opening of the word would come into the church and listen we would not be asking for a little bit come on you're the you're the culmination you're the final age you're the final people in other words you're not lot marking the time by just Angels you're not Abraham just marking about the angels of the Lord Elohim you're not just Rahab marketed by Messengers you're not just knowing marking it by Revelation and you're not just Daniel marking it by books but you got the angels you got for Messengers you got the Revelation you got the books come on you are a people who has been equipped to overcome this age by the message he was ordained to believe and brother M turns and says now if there ever was a time that we ought to be setting ourselves in order to pray it's now can you hear Daniel with me for a second I can hear Daniel say I understand my books that one of these days you're coming into this I understand by books that one of these days are coming into this captivity and then all of a sudden a prophet breaks into a realm and says I understand if there ever was a time we ought to be said in order to pray it's now he said I understand that there'll come scoffers in the last days I understand they'll be Nation against nation in the last days I understand there'll be tidal waves in the last days I understand there'll be fearful science like flying saucers in the heaven mysterious science men's Hearts fill them for fear and there'll be perplexing of time and it is stressed among the people I read the all good organization the nomination and have a confederation in the last days I understand that women will Bob off their hair in the last days I understand there will shorts and walk with high-heeled shoes they can Deacon as they go the tickling as they go in the last days I understand the morale will be very low in the last days I understand that preachers will be false shepherds in the last days they'll compromise and will not feed the people the word of God but we'll go after Creeds and things and instead but this is mine brother Rod but I understand there'll be a voice come in the last days come on Church the same books that marks the condition of women that marks the condition of men that marks the conditions of politics marks the condition of them around the people are the very same books that says so come a voice crying out of the winners calling the people back to the original message back to the things of God I understand by the books these things will take place can I say it to you like this and I'm done I understand by the books that people can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with them I understand my books if there'll be an invincible Army I understand by books amen that missing limbs will be restored I understand amen by books that some morning between six and nine you'll be standing in a mirror and combing your hair and your body will be changed can I leave your fist if there is a spirit on you that is ashamed of this message and ashamed of these books I rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ you say brother Andrew what do you mean what do you mean by these books I understand my things that are to be I've got a theophany I understand by The Rapture that there'll be a shout a voice and a trumpet I understand come on church I understand by the future home that there's a marriage supper of the lamb and I'm going to sit there I understand by books that my name was on the Lamb's Book of Life and it was put there before the foundation of the world I understand my books I understand see what's happened the church has come under a prophetic utterance and by coming under this prophetic utterance it's the fourth light which is the message of life which is ordained you to understand I understand by books you're the final voice laughs ordained to prophesy again now brother Andrew you're laying this on us pretty heavy well I pray the spirit Lord will break it down for you because I know these are all things you've been taught for years I understand that this message is not an opinion I understand it's an absolute what are you saying I'm saying a gift of Prophecy is judged by two or three people right but a prophet is not judged because it's the absolute truth I understand by books that the message is the absolute judge and it's not subject to your question or your opinions I understand by books to say what a Vindicated Prophet says will make you a Prophet of Truth and anything else out of that must be judged I understand that if you say what a prophet said it'll give you a perfect Faith to keep on saying it I understand by books that if you'll get underneath this third pull anointing it'll go from an anointing to a super anointing I've got to quit it's Wednesday night I understand if you get under these books it'll anoint you to say what a prophet's saying come on have you ever taken time to read Look Away to Jesus and read the dialogue The Prophet rehearses between Hattie Wright and himself when he come in there from speaking squirrels I was reading it today very powerful he said I said and then I said and then she said and when I say it then little Hattie Wright said and when she said that then I said Hattie right you can go read it for yourself but I'm going somewhere and then she said brother random everybody was crying said what shall I ask I said you're poor you live on a hill with no money you might ask for that you got a little crippled sister sitting here oh my Edith it can be healed I said your father and Mother's old broke down asked for them I said he just told me the same voice said give her what she asked for and she looked around and said well I say brother random I said what is your desire the greatest thing her boys were even snickering and laughing and she said the greatest desire I have is the Salvation of my two sons then I say it bring him here let me lay my hands on them let me pray over them let me read them the sinner's prayer let me rehearse in the sermon I said I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ and there they went and they've been faithful in church with communion and the little fellas sitting there washing their feet with man amen we are all a witness of that what are you say about Andrew I'm saying under this third pull anointing when you hear the prophetic utterance from the voice of the seventh angel it's not this will it happen it's not a question of will it happen it is a question of when will it happen come on church this is not a vague gift this is not a oh I oh I oh I see I show you I say I see I see you got a knee pain I see you had a bad day somebody in the room here is not feeling this is not that kind of message this is a direct ordination accurate pinpointed laser guided without one mistake without one error guided right to the Target of the devil can I say this when you hear this prophetic utterance it's time to make preparation for the fulfilling [Music] brother Russell when you hear it it's not a win is the rain coming Elijah it's not a win is the rain coming it's a go get your barrels I hear the sound of an abundance of rain and you know what I found out I found the same word sound is used in Revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sail come on church I close with this if you're running low go get your barrels there's an abundance of Revelation if you're sick in your body go get your barrels there's an abundance of healing if you need the Holy Ghost go get your barrels and become an empty vessel there's an abundance of holy ghost power if you need your joy back go get your barrels there's a joy unspeakable and full of Glory if you need your peace back go get your barrels there's a peace that passes all understanding won't you stand to your feet with us tonight [Applause] time to make preparation for the fulfilling I understand my books [Applause] well Andrew I don't know about all this well I can tell you this is the musicians are coming if you can accept this prophetic utterance it will renew your life brother Brian said when Elijah said out there under that tree he said he was so weak brother Ron he couldn't even run he said he couldn't even climb the hill I love this he said but when he accepted it you know his life must have been renewed because the outrun ahab's Chariot he run before the Chariot when he couldn't even climb the hill he run before those Swift horses when he got underneath that prophetic utterance but Andrew what are you saying I'm saying this what has been thought has been spoken has been written is revealed has been fulfilled is being fulfilled will be fulfilled Abraham said we're already waiting for the Rapture the Rapture of the Saints has been spoken so shall it be it's been spoken it has to come to pass it will come to pass can I can I say this to you tonight if you never hear this crazy spit and swathering carrying on preacher again please hear this you've been ordained to this message [Music] said somewhere Shirley Jehovah has a man he can put his hands on me who will not compromise with them ungodly organizations who will swing the people back to the Rock Christ Jesus back to the original Pentecost the arrest of the Holy Ghost with the original signs original wonders surely surely he's got someone somewhere who will not break down under any kind of persecution he said they will not run out they will not be counseled out they will not fall out or anything else they'll stay with it isn't that something brother brother and I sitting there in the room today listen to that tape and hurt brother say that and did not run through me in an age where everything's being canceled cancel culture everything's being canceled there's a people on the Earth that understand my books it can't be canceled they can't be persecuted enough to turn around they've been ordained to it once you bow your hearts with us tonight listen I can't say nothing against what anybody else is doing in the world the nazarene's the Salvation Army Pentecostals all doing what they feel to do [Music] but God's ordained me to preach a message he's our danger Pastor here to preach this message he's ordained these men of God in this church to preach this message you say brother Andrew I'm not a preacher then he's ordained you to believe it he's ordained you to just not come to service and watch brother Ron preach and listen to Brother Steve preacher whoever and go home the same way he's ordained you to go home and lay in this message young people get beneath it Elders get beneath brother Andrew I've been in the message 50 years get back

heart all of these years and as I get older and and everything I look into these books and I think why don't others see what I see oh but the day has arrived and I think you're going to see it get better and better he said these tapes brother Lindsey gonna get clearer and clearer we're not talking about getting away the fuzz Le and all the background noise we're talking about the word of God

that tape got out of California and I believe that God is still calling people because the message is not to stay in a book it's not to stay on a tape it doesn't replace Church it doesn't replace the

the word father and that word being revealed to us that father gives a word Revival not a something that's worked up no it's something that becomes intoxicated because when you drink something that is stimulating oh it stimulates you I don't care if the flashes and feeling it the flesh don't have to feel it God is weaning his bride away from the five fleshly feelings to say I believe you and I believe your word and it don't matter what I see all going around me it is the word and the word alone father I thank you and I love you I pray you bless our brother Andrew his wife his ministry wherever he goes may he stir the hearts of the people God because I can see he's feeding on that word I love it Lord when I see young men feeding on the word and when they feed on the word they become the word I thank you Father that that's what Daniel did he purposed within himself he began to read the words of Jeremiah because Jeremiah Was father he was ordained to preach a word that later someone would take and read the prophecy of that book father we are reading right now the prophecy of Malachi 4 in the books but the prophecy is becoming manifested in a living bride I thank you for
