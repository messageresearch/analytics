things I just got a text from brother Sergio he is all clear doctors said all tests came back let's give God praise as you all know that could read very different sir absolutely I believe that God is our healer and many times we have the symptoms we have and everybody goes to pray in yes seriously and to Heart amen I have a baby dedication this morning brother Andrew and sister Caitlyn Sylvester uh so let's uh as I read the scripture here in just a moment let's sing bring them in bring them them in oh bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus amen praise the Lord Amen brother Andrew sister Caitlyn look at these big smiles huh yeah you got two beautiful little children amen and realizing what a great responsibility it is is and they said brother Ron um please keep it short and sweet uh for the dedication you know and so we'll do that and the scripture says in Luke 18:1 15 and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein amen they have their little son Jude uh Andrew Jude actually means praised and Andrew means manly or Brave so I believe saints of God it's extremely important as our Prophet told us and reminded us so often name your children names of character amen something that will help guide them that will give them a direction in their life and I pray that he'll be one that will be praised in this end time that not only will he be prais but he will praise His Goden amen and I pray that he may be manly and brave and may he be raised up to be a a mighty Gentile Warrior standing against the while is the enemy in this end time age that we are in amen so I'll take this little one short and sweet I'll rock him just like you but there ain't nobody like Mama let's bow our heads heavenly father as I hold in my arms this little love gift that you have given to Andrew and Caitlyn and father we know that you do all things wonderfully and you're a giver of every good gift I pray now for Jude Andrew I pray that you will watch over him may he be a child that be praised by his parents but most of all be praised by his God and I pray that may he be manly and brave in all the Commandments that he has been given and may he be one of those father in this end time that is true to Thy word we bless him now in Jesus Christ's name amen was that short enough hey sometimes parents get a little nervous and say okay anyway we love you guys God bless you thank you so much amen we also have a a a baby announcement another eaglet has arrived to brother gin and Rebecca musango January 27th at 502 a.m. 94 o 22 Ines and I'm not sure how you say that either Joel or goel how do you say it go goel yeah yeah who how many know who the goel is yeah that mediator so good praise the Lord amen what a beautiful baby huh yeah thank god let's give God praise for that amen praise the Lord amen I enjoyed the song specials now if you're spiritual you'll catch some connotation see what God does is he allows certain ones to become inspired to sing a song at a certain time and you'll find out that these songs are actually sermons because they are inspired by the holy spirit for this hour amen and I love that and so I appreciate it and thank all three of you three groups that that sang but that one that you are the people is actually speaking about a people walking in Prophecy and you know we we can look back at what God has done in the past and we can just look at it as historical but I don't want to look at it just as historical but as types and shadows amen and if we can see the types and shadows from what God has done as it was then so shall it be amen so then we can kind of know the direction for where we're going we can look from the time of Abraham how God that gave the promise until the time the the promise was actually manifested and after manifestation there's still trials there's still God testing Abraham that's right you all know and so you can go from Abraham you could go to the first Exodus you could see God with Moses and what's amazing is even Moses himself he got a little flustered with God I think sometimes we can do the same thing and he said wherefore hast thou not delivered thy people I've given them every time thus sayith the Lord and it got worse go figure how many times have you had God deal things with things in your life and God was doing Supernatural events all around you but things also got worse amen things always get worse before they get better but he said Lord why did you send me seeing thou has not delivered thy people well just hang on keep reading the story God is never too late he comes on the scene we as humans we get in our timeline and we think well uh uh Hey it should have happened by 77 yeah come on we saw that come and go should have been y 2K and here we are in 2024 and we're still going along well if 2024 doesn't fulfill the year of his coming then we'll be expecting 2025 so we don't put a uh uh a limit on God but we know that God is in control I had a bunch of questions sent to me I'm just going to read them very quickly I have got an awful lot you guys hang on cuz I'll have you uh we'll we'll sing a song here before we let you sit down um I've got a lot on my plate I told the brethren in the back room I'll probably go into overtime this morning so that's okay is that okay with you do I have your permission if you have to go at 12:00 and you got a something in the oven and you don't want to make a burnt offering you are free to leave early but your name will be off of our church mealing list so just be you know I'm joking with you some maybe some don't but you know it's not a place to joke but I like to make you smile and laugh now and then okay here are some questions sent to me I'm not going to even answer them right now but just food for thought this is probably a couple months worth of uh sermons that I can be preaching uh what was the purpose for the wave sheep was the message of the hour waved over the wheat field that many membered body of Christ are we presently living in that hour did the fullness of Christ that dwelt in one man Jesus Christ come down in Revelations 10:7 to finish the mystery of God by the spoken word known as the message of the hour brought through the prophet Malachi 4 brother brandham is Malachi 4:5 behold I send you are you the manifestation of the mystery of Revelations 10:7 Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Lord the great and Dreadful day of the Lord can you think of any ways how Rebecca of the Old Testament is a type of the Bride of the New Testament is the many membered body of Christ being held like a hostage in the tunnel of their own human mind captured and lost in their human mind but never lost in God's mind Hey God's not worried you know we worry but God doesn't amen you might be lost but not in his mind amen is the intelligence of God's mind being received by divine revelation woo yeah yes through her listening post which is called the seed Gene remember brother B said in every C Gene is a listening post are you listening amen say amen amen amen which was placed in her before God was good God oh my this is getting deep could an infinite all- knowing god lose a part of himself did God allow us to be placed in the pawn shop of this carnal world can we be redeemed within a certain amount of time by the set price of redemption can a person's human birth be granted eternal life what what does it say to you one day I realize I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham does redemption say this to you I am from God and I go to God God bless you with great evening light Revelation amen and amen nice questions huh let's stand and sing Redemption by Blood that's the greatest love story you see saints of God we've got a you know every one of us are interested in the eschatology of God for what purpose did God send us this message where are we at in the chronological timeline is God too late what do we expect to happen is there another message messenger coming on the scene what are the events that we should be looking for modern events made clear by prophecy all of these saints of God are found within the message of the hour and all I am is a Timothy putting you in remembrance of what's already been said I'm casting all my cares on you why because he carth for me let's sing it and Lord I'm casting all my cares on you I know you love me oh Redemption by Blood oh that's the greatest love story full restoration full Redemption that's what seven angels in the CL testify my rede no longer he's pris oh he's coming back for you and Lord I'm casting all my cares on you I know you love [Music] me Redemption by Blood oh that's my redeemer no longer dead he's risen oh he's coming back for you and amen that's true that's more than a song it's a declaration amen amen God bless you let's stand remain standing Luke 17 Luke 21 God bless you all this morning I greet you in the name of the Lord we have so many visitors and my precious friends uh from here and there and rather than take up the time because I have so much on my plate let me just say to all of you as a scattered gun blessing and welcome we love you and thank you for being here with us amen a amen each and everyone thank you Lord Luke 17 verse 28-30 like Al likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted and they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed watch the comparison when a Son of God moves into position then God fulfills his word and brings prophetic events to pass but he could not rain down fire and brimstone until lot got into position are we aware of that amen amen turn with me Luke 21: 25- 28 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity they wonder why all of the distress why is this look at this my I I tell you tell you what if people just watch the news it's no wonder they become neurotic there's only one news I want to hear and that's a good news amen amen the Sea and the W waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken so it starts on Earth it's going to shake all the way behold I shake the heavens and the Earth One More Time amen and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory now this is not that time of scripture that he'll come and all the eyes of the word shall World shall see him coming in the Clouds Of Glory because this is a secret coming this a mystery amen and yet it's saying notice you're going to see all the signs now sign signs don't turn your heart to God that's right unless you're El seed all it is is a sign do you understand unless it's revealed to you of God doing it for a purpose in season whoa did you see what the sun did what about the Moon look at those uh uh waves roaring look at this oh my they get All Shook Up amen and when these things begin to come to pass look up lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth n oh hallelujah amen turn around Shake somebody's hand say he's coming amen now you can all be seated in the presence of the Lord he's coming amen he's coming amen he's coming yes praise the Lord thank you all right I would like to title my sermon this morning the revelation of the son of man brings position and Perfection the revelation of the son of man brings position and Perfection I should add another p in there power transforming power that's going to get you out of here yes sir and I want to take a subject the spirit and bride are saying the same thing amen amen so I have and I just wanted to because there were some thoughts that this morning the Lord was dealing with me and now I just start writing them down and um brother Brenham says here Faith isn't something that's imaginary right I didn't give this to the Brethren so they don't need to look for it I want to get you uh I want to get a uh you to get it faith is a direct Revelation see if you only accept Christ as your savior by intellectual you haven't got it yet you cannot say that Jesus is the Christ until the the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you see intellectual Faith oh if I could only get that one point right now down so we could go home in every heart I'm thankful for this place position I'm I'm thankful for this place position right now so he's talking about something that's going to come to your heart direct Revelation what does it bring to you position and placing amen come on amen but if you can't understand how it that faith is not something mentally perceived but it's a revelation a revelation of God by faith not intellectual but by the heart amen God I want this message to go beyond the carnal intellect of human understanding and the only way it'll drop down from the Mind Into the Heart Is by the revelation of the Holy Spirit right amen most people miss the kingdom of God by about 12 in they abort the seed germ of God in the womb of their mind even though it is a gerti seed it cannot pre pregnate the seed that is hidden in the heart until it goes past the human mind and goes then into the channel by faith fath right and comes in there and brother Bram said when it does he said that seed Gene excuse me the seed of life from the male comes down impregnates that seed Gene within the female he said it then takes life Hallelujah so now we understand these things but I I want to bring it down a little more home to us this morning and I was reading in 1 Samuel about Abigail and the Bible says and Abigail was a woman of great understanding you see when we start taking these women in scriptures that are catching things yeah the promise given unto Abraham was manifested in Sarah yeah the promise was given to Abraham but Sarah does not come into the picture until God moves on Sarah and it says and Sarah receive strength to conceive seed until then she was an immature virgin woman there was nothing wrong with the Seed of Abraham all right it was gerti seed but the right seed in the wrong womb will bring forth an ishmail every time Ishmael was 15 years old when Isaac was weaned and he persecuted the C Gene of God Amen so you understand there's a maturing just like they were singing about we are the people yeah understand put yourself into prophecy the bride has matured now she's no longer immature in her faith she was at one time cuz God is not going to marry an immature virgin amen like Sarah herself came into a perfect Faith see she had to find her position which was a place a condition before she could produce the promise amen amen she no longer passing off Supernatural visitation to another womb right Sarah by faith receives strength to conceive seed how many within the message I say for year and year after year after year brandom seed brandom seed tape after tape on and you don't conceive you conform dress long hair no makeup but without Revelation that alone carry you so far but Upon This Rock The Rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it father allow this message to conceive in our soul amen that it'll bring a manifestation in my life that you won't just have to hear me quote the prophet the quotes will be living in my life I will be the message made [Applause] manifest Hallelujah Mary though she was visited now I'm just giving you these qu I even gone into my sermon yet I want you to understand Mary though visited by supernatural angels yeah and Supernatural events and she was predestinated to be able to live in the realm of the Supernatural and to catch the events of things happening in her life and blessed art thou Mary among all women now here is an angel she doesn't understand how can these things be seeing I know not a man she didn't understand she was not quickened I want all of you to understand there is a time and a season for God's word to be quickened even as it was in Mary it's got to be confirmed conceived manifested in our life for it to come to pass so there is a time and a season how can this be not many days hence so there's a Time a chronology hang on hang on don't get don't get nervous Mary God's in control not many days well how many days don't matter we're we're always human well how long is like your kids okay we're going on vacation we're going to drive in a car and we're going to get you know an hour in inside the car are we there yet are we there yet no I'll let you know and man you know you give your kids all these goodies to go ahead and eat while they while we're in the car to kind of pass the time within a half hour they're gone anyway we don't need to keep saying Are We There Yet you'll you'll know when we get there so understand there is a time of conception amen Enoch's Pyramid has seven steps to Perfection right to go into the king's chamber because the king's chamber has that last and final step of perfection and remember even Esther does not have the king's scepter until she comes into the king's chamber so we understand we can see from Abigail we can see from Sarah we can see from Mary we can go on and on Ruth and Boaz we could just take time after time to show you that we should not be worried we should not be all upset well why hasn't it happened we're still here well praise God we're still here guys you can't the Rapture can't happen without me why because I got the resurrection in me so do you brother Braham said don't resent this I can prove to you the Rapture is in you now you're just waiting for it to happen amen come on how many of you are Rapture Ready amen I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready to go amen I'm under expectation oh yeah I see a lot of little issues I see a lot of things in in my life and yes have faults and failures but that's okay I'm like Abraham thank you Lord the bride is predestinated now here we're going to jump into the sermon stay with me if you would bride is predestinated and ordained to catch the realm of the supernatural so I'm bringing you in you are the people she's designed to catch visions and to catch Supernatural instruction amen so brother brm said in the revelation of Jesus Christ he says I'm not going to read all the quote just the highlighted portion you can read the rest of it when you get home then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we fail to get it it's going to take the operation of the Holy Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction understand you were ordained predestinated of God to live in the realm of the supernatural Hallelujah this whole message is Supernatural and if you don't catch the picture within the picture all you do is see a man you see a prophet with a gift and he does a great ministry and all kinds of people came to him and flocked but if you fail to catch the picture or the voice behind the veil you miss it amen and you're just caught up in first in second poll but you're not going to go into the third poll that's right it takes Supernatural instruction acquired the the ability to hear from God but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear I don't care how many tapes you listen to right you can listen and listen and go from 47 to 65 how we need to hear from God lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know why did God send this message is it just for you to wear a long dress and have long hair or do Church order there's oh if that's you know see unfortunately what happens is people tend to make it carnal and denominational IE it and and then we make a cookie cutter you're in the message if you got a long dress and long hair and this and and pretty soon without Revelation long hair and long dress goes out the window if it's ever revealed to you from the presence of God Holiness comes from within it's understanding what God wants done with his word amen all right so it isn't something that you get in in a seminary school you don't get it through comparing verse by verse it isn't something taught to you out of a School of Theology it is not something that you learn from man's teaching it isn't something that you catch from your pastor or even the prophet himself it must come from God and it is not understood in a carnal mind that's right but those who are predestinated have it already hardwired brother brandham said that you have a listening post and you have this ability to receive the signal that God is sending to him that hath an ear brother ram calls it the listening post he will hear what the spirit is saying to the church amen now it's not hearing a natural voice I'm might have to take off my jacket I'm going to work thank amen seed of God are predestinated to catch it amen they can't help it they can't explain it it just happens God used Luther and then he moved on God used Wesley and then he moved on God used pennyel then he moved on God used William brandom and then he moved on don't let that offend you it is that moving on that brings you into your position otherwise you just play tapes and you listen to what God has done and it doesn't have any effect on you and you're just waiting until I hear the next tape until I go to church the next service and somewhere the lights going to turn on well no once you get one of those aha moments when you catch it it's God revealing it to you amen and then you move the Bible says and Noah moved by fear because God gave him faith it says he was moved by faith you see that Hebrews 11 chapter I remember when I was just a first Christian and I was reading my Bible and I says the substance of faith faith is this and that and substance of things hoped for and evidence of Things Not Seen and by faith Abraham and by faith Noah by faith and I real real every sentence almost in the whole chapter by Faith by Faith by faith and so it is with you and I if it's not by faith what is faith God making himself known to you you not under Creeds and dogmas and things that we try to cause the church to conform I want you to be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen okay now watch God changing his mask can we understand that concept brother brandham said this is God's Great drama he starts in genes is he puts on a mask called Adam do we understand that we see God and Adam yeah enter chapter 2 scene two serpent comes in da da da da all this stuff and we watch God all the way down and it's the drama God in morpha God in Adam and then we began to see God in Seth we begin to see he was a replace for Abel and we begin to see God putting on a mask and down through all the scriptures we see it's God in his people God in morpa it's a holy spirit leading the church because it was the Christ of God right when Philip went and got Nathaniel's and said come and see we have found the Christ of God remember they had the scriptures they had the writing of Moses but they had never seen it become clear listen we had our Bibles we had theologians but we never saw God in scripture come to the realities here now until this message without this message you didn't know if he's one God or three Gods you didn't know how to baptized you didn't know nothing thank God he sent a prophet amen otherwise we all be fighting we have Seminary this and that we be fighting over a dip thong y am watch this now God changes his Mass the mystery continues the ministry continues and the voice continues God never changes when takes one man off the scene he may take that man off but he never takes his Spirit how many of you are aware that's the prophet's teaching so somewhere on this Earth there is somebody that is a voice representation of this message right now because Malachi 4 came he sounded his trumpet and guess what God took him home so now what do we do do we pray for God to return him in another Ministry cuz we failed to catch it the first time huh remember the angel said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun his first coming you and your ministry he said now here's type in Shadow right amen that's good when the graves of the Saints came open and John the Baptist came up with all of the resurrected saints that he have to say hey wait a second wait just a second let me preach another sermon to bring you into rapturing and and elevating Grace no John had already said Behold the Lamb of God so when his Earthly Ministry was over he didn't have a return Ministry it's not in the scripture it's not there in type but he will be because the prophet says in every age the messenger of that age will introduce that age to Christ right amen he said actually even every Pastor will stand with his congregation what a great responsibility the pastor have to look after their sheep true so the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing are we there I believe we've come to the time I'm not putting it off for some other and I'm not looking for another messenger I believe we have arrived because the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing amen now watch this a lot of you see in church age in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of Lan age its Messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficient effect of that prophet's Ministry and they shall hear and they that hear him will be blessed and become a part of the Bride of the last day who are mentioned in Revelations 22:17 somebody say I got it what is that the spirit and the bride they come so now he's taken those who's receive the prophet's Ministry they have now become prophecy we are the people okay so what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word remember they're not adding two well here's my interpretation here's what it is no God don't want nobody to add to and take away he wants you to say what's already been said they are saying it now what are they saying watch this now come out from among her now and be ye separate from who Jezebel religion denomination come out of this denominational nonsense come away from Mystery Babylon come away from Jezebel religion and come into the truth amen somebody say Amen am the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age Matthew 16: 1-4 the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven he answered and said to them what when it is evening you say it will be fair weather the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lry oh ye Hypocrites yeah ye can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulteration an adulterous generation seek a sign see Believers don't seek signs signs follow them I expect signs to follow I expect God to be doing wonderful miraculous things I expect I don't need to have a sign go before me and say okay this is Vindication of my Ministry now signs follow Believers is it possible God can give a supernatural sign and some see it and others are blinded to it now Ephesians 3 7-2 wherefore I made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given in Me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am least than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery what is the fellowship why in the world do we come to this church yeah it's certainly not because of me I know that my feet are firmly on the ground I am not the greatest preacher around I'm not the brightest bulb on the billboard I don't have a singing Ministry my wife don't play play the piano I realize that so I look at this you have a fellowship of the mystery that's why we're here yes listen we're here because of the message I don't I don't need to take any glory to myself well praise God all these people are in the church this morning because of me you got to be kidding me no sir if there's anything that I have ever done or helped anybody or you've received anything from God it's because Ron got himself out of the way and God used me it's just a tool huh this pen oh what a great pen I am I can write great Revelations of God you are silent buddy until I pick you up you're just a pen lousy little pen yeah Amen brother but you're a gift in my [Applause] hand Hallelujah God help us to be a vessel to be a scribe to be something wherein God can write his word on the tables of our [Applause] hearts verse 10 to the intent that now under the principalities powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him by the faith of him it's not even your faith the faith you got is a gift thank you Lord given to you by grace through faith huh lest any man should boast right even the Apostle Paul asked for this thorn in his flesh to be removed because you know what God was giving him abundance of Revelation man woo I tell you what I'm preaching things that them people don't even understand even the disciples say that Paul preaches things that I don't understand whether I was in the heaven I don't know whether I was in the body out I don't know right but he was preaching great Mysteries but Paul said it wasn't me him you understand now the identified Christ of every age made each believer to follow the leadership of the spirit they were anointed of the holy spirit that was leading them why did Abel offer a lamb he was led he was given a revelation Cain also worshiped he also made an altar and he brought of the beautiful fruits of the field which wrong Revelation because he takes the cursed fruits curs it be the ground remember God didn't curse Adam he's a Son of God God will never curse his own flesh that's right God cursed the god cursed the ground around adamen okay Earth because you have done this thistles and Briars oh let me tell you you think you've seen big avocados you ain't seen nothing till we get over there that's right one avocado will feed a family what I'm saying the fruits of the Earth are being held back because God cursed it but he's going to lift that curse pretty soon there's going to be a millennial rain huh there's Hallelujah there going to be a honeymoon and God is going to lift the curse Hallelujah okay hold another sermon Saul the Pharisee was blinded by religion he was under the greatest Theologian of his day Gia and so God had to Blind him to open his eyes sometimes God has got to lay you on your back he's got to have something calamitous to happen to you to get you to look up cuz you can get so carnal so busy so narrow-minded well it's off to work we go hi ho Dario and all we do work go home kids all kinds of issues bills I never wanted these bills but she wanted the house it's the woman thou gave us me and we get all these pressures and we lose our vision for what really is going on because Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God all these other things houses

tomorrow she looks at me is that all that's on your mind no I got a few other things but that that's one of the top of the list Jesus said your father knew that you'd have need of these things and he knew you'd think about him but says don't get caught up in all those things see he was blinded by theology so God had to Blind his eyes to open his eyes he had to knock him off his high horse somebody say Amen am I'm CEO of this board I got a thrive in business I got power and authority I can put people in prison I can even have them killed what an authority he's all cocky thinking he's doing God a service and God has to knock him off his high horse put him in the dust where he belongs oh God oh God sometimes that happens to us you may say oh my something very calamitus happen Billy Paul had to

a part of himself Adam amen do you know where you're at dum dum on I'm hiding I know I know you're hiding what are you hiding from hast thou eaten of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil because you never ran from me before brother brandom said you watch right a good Christian person start eating of the wrong thing you I tell you what you start eating of all of this nonsense that's on the internet and you'll be backslid you let your kids sit there and give them a babysitter of an iPhone or iPad and all this stuff and you give it to them and let me tell you they will entice themselves from the Tree of knowledge and watch them yeah well they shut up can't control my kids so I give them an iPad give him the iPad and that little blue haze mesmerizes them and the serpent Paul said I am jealous over you with a Godly children because as a serpent be gu the so shall he come in and deceive your minds huh like the serpent huh any of you ever seen The Jungle Book right and call I am the great car slow moving snake he ain't like fast like a leopard or a lion he's slow moving as a serpent how do serpents which are slow and got no feet to be able to run how do they catch an Impala yeah on they just brush up I can get away from this guy at any time you get a little too cocky for who you think you are and Time After Time the Philistines be upon you yeah till finally you get a haircut God's got your number do you I know I'm preaching to somebody today religious teachings of God's word teachings that are void of Revelation makes a person religious do you know religious people in this message that claim to be the bride of Christ and hate others that go to another church I've seen physical families brothers and sisters siblings that believe a different revelation of this message different opinion of it and they won't even open the door I was in Texas I had one of the brothers in my in my church The the brother and his wife they love the Lord they love this message his brother was a deacon in another church and my goodness he needed to get something okay borrow a tool from his brother he knew his brother had the tool so he called him up Hey listen and I went with him to go get the tool and you know how his brother did ding W it's him this is how he opened the door what do you want oh you want that two all right well hang on it wasn't oh my brother younger brother hallelujah praise the Lord come in my house don't stand in the rain have you ever seen somebody do that walk down the street see somebody in the market on that goes to another church and you see him I hope they didn't see me then you catch him in the checkout line oh no hurry up hurry up come on scan that thing that should yeah makes us laugh because it happens and then we tell our children now we're the bride of Christ man we ain't got no issues we're we're it we're the cream of the crop you might be a part of the crop but you ain't the cream what if you're the chef what if you're a part of the shook what if you're just a carrier I'm not a possessor amen amen that's why no matter what we preach to our children it's our lives that they watch and if your lives do not convince your children that you're in love with Jesus Christ it's just religion and your children will say because somebody will ask them what church you go to ah evening Life Fellowship what they believe well our church our religion says our religion no pants on the women we can't go to movies because that's what our religion says is that what you have as religion I want a relationship Lord with all of my getting let me get understanding Lord if I ever preach a sermon that is effective to your people it's because God came in here and he transferred the thought otherwise I am as one that beateth the air I'm one that's running or watch me run I tell you what and I got to read the quote and when I do I got to get some volume cuz volume is anointing see but once God anoints your understanding I want to ask you is God heart of hearing let me ask you in your prayer closet do you scream at God come on I'll tell you now I'm going to share with you a very intimate portion of my prayer when I need God and and I'm in my prayer closet I'm not screaming and yelling I'm on my face before God and sometimes I cannot even verbalize with my mouth and I groan oh and I'm broken and I don't know what say the Bible says your moanings and your groanings are understood by the spirit of God have you ever groaned God knows exactly why you're groaning and he understands my intimate prayer with God is silent the in the intimate revelation of God space of about a half hour of Silence I'm going to bring to you with the opening of The Seven Seals I'm going to give you words I'm going to reveal something to you that I don't even have to say out loud there are times when my wife and I become so one there are times when I want to say something and she's already got the Revelation and the older we get the more we think alike yeah we've become one because of a union do you understand amen God help me I'm on page four now watch this so when you come to church or coming here that you might perfect your walk in God lord show me the things I'm doing wrong not the things you're doing right because if we're not careful we measure ourselves by ourselves and we become really ignorant don't we well I'm better than at least three or four people at church we're looking down at others when you measure yourself to the Perfection of Christ how do you measure ah wish you wouldn't have said that cuz I'm a failure amen yep so was Abraham in his flesh but Abraham by faith oh I'm going to get into something here I'm going to get into something it wasn't because Abraham was without mistakes it wasn't that he didn't have faults and failures right but God gave him faith and it was imputed do you know what imputed means it was counted to his account yes Brother David I'll tell you what I want to give you a million bucks buddy you have to give me your account number I tell you what you would text it to me so fast right because you want me to impute to you you would love to hear ping he didn't lie to me I got a million might might be in some foreign currency that's not worth anything but he got a million huh any of you ever hey the Zimbabwe the Zim Zimbabwe dollar hey I turned in $150 US dollar I was a multi-millionaire million hey it took us several million dollars to go to a a a In-N-Out restaurant they did it wasn't In-N-Out it was one of these fast foods like a Wendy's we go up there and I am not joking I'm not joking brother Godwin jit sindii pastor of a church there he had a box full of Zim dollars a box a carton he carried it in the stack of million dollar bills they're all bound and and everything like that and I said well I'll take I'll take the uh breakfast uh whatever you know the egg and the bacon well we don't have that okay well give me the one below that well now we don't have that either well give me the next one well we don't have that I said what do you have and they told me I said okay I'll take it anyway we got three of those and he said okay that'll be 350 million Zim dollars whatever you got to be kidding so brother godman puts a box like that so when somebody said I'm going to give you million bucks ask him what kind of currency anyway I don't know why I said that but I did Ephesians 4 verses 11 through1 13 and he gave some somebody say some Apostles and Prophets and evangelists and some pastors and teachers didn't give all of them he gave some I just part I just pray I'm one of the some he gave some for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ till we come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man that's it and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ wow now brother Brenham says in the sermon perseverance I am not going to be able to get through all of my sermon today that's okay is that okay I know some of you are hungry I am my wife's got me on this intermittent fasting I don't like to fast when I'm hungry and the time can't go fast enough anyway okay perseverance 1962 I believe that there's a church coming into that Perfection amen that Ministry yeah of perfection a Ministry there is going to be a Ministry of perfection let's say Ministry of perfection Ministry of brother Ram said it yeah so I believe it where the offices were Apostles prophets teachers P for the perfecting of the church and pastors and teachers so forth we be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up onto the coming of the Lord I believe that I believe we're nearing that now wow if you said that in 62 what about 2024 God speak to my heart this morning and let me walk perfect before you let me be like Enoch who walked with God because before he had his translation amen he had this testimony that he pleased God because without faith it is impossible that's right to please him than First Kings 8: 61 let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord Our God to walk in his statutes and to keep his Commandments as at that at this day you see when you are re you are united with the bridegroom everything that he is we become that's right amen when a woman is united in marriage to her groom there is no prenatural agreement if it is you better not marry that guy cuz the moment you do something wrong I'm taking my stuff and leaving you no prenup but when you are united with your groom guess what it is well known everything he got is part yours Hallelujah do you know Arizona is a community property state the law states I don't care if you wasn't even married if you live together for so many years as community property guess what if you leave her she can go to the court and guess what got half of you yeah it's the law happens every day yeah well we wasn't even married no you would live in together community property State how many people in Arizona know Arizona is a community property State anyway I don't know why I said that now don't you get some wild hair idea right now some oh boy this guy I'm going to leave here going to take half what do you got yeah well the woman cannot divorce the man right right oh why'd you have to say that okay boy got silent listen how many know great minds think alike Philippians 3:15 let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything be and if anything be otherwise minded God will will reveal this even unto you amen our Perfection is not within our own ability somebody say I got it it's not you that's right it's him am we used to sing that song it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace I'm saved it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace I'm saved oh if I could sing like some of you that got good abil like Greg if I could sing like Greg yoro my sermon would be filled with Melodies I'd sing so beautiful you'd weep your way to the altar but I don't have that ability but what ability I do have is to take what God has always dealt with me with I got a little sling I'm not a mighty preacher I just been watching the sheep for a few years and I've met a bear and a lion in my life and guess what you uncircumcised Philistine the same God that delivered me how many know that was a guided missile that's right how many of you remember George Martin from over there in South Africa any of you ever hear wonderful speaker and man he he he kept you cap captivated he said here was was David went and got five Stones put it in a sling he says and he slung it towards Goliath and Goliath being a man of war he saw that thing coming and he said and he went right and he said and the thing started curving so he moves left and it curves to the left he said it was a guided missile knocked him so hard knocked him backwards knocked him out killed him a little old David runs up there and he don't even have a sword he takes Goliath's own sword picks up the head and guess what guess what the Philistines did run for your lives right okay okay now look in a sermon Souls that are in prison now God reflected himself back in that and he became a man when he be became Jesus Christ excuse me Christ Jesus and he was God see God was in Christ see lived in him reconciling the world to himself through that perfect man each one of us yeah are you included in that say that's me Mama come on Moses I need you to get here and sing that song they don't get it each one of us imperfect that believe in God and has accepted that becomes the Perfection of him amen thank you Lord oh wow you mean to tell me there was an exchange he became me that I might become him thank you Lord you mean he left the Splendor of Heaven to come down to take my place Praise You Lord when it was nothing but to be condemned for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God no man in Heaven Nor on Earth was worthy to take the book but the gift of God yeah is eternal life through Jesus Christ if you have never accepted Jesus Christ in your life you were on your way to hell that's right if you don't accept the pardon that he gave by being your substitute then you will pay for your sins amen I wouldn't be caught dead without Christ amen amen some of you missed that yeah you young people if you have missed the essence of the message perhaps it's because the ministry wasn't preaching the right kind of ministry they're bringing to you rules regulations and like a cookie cutter we you go ahead and long dress long hair this and that and then bless you you're a message believer and how many of of them were stamped message Believers for years until one day I've been in

he's smoking man she said you do it again you're off the airplane even while we're in flight you can Mo watch the movie Gone With the Wind the reason I said that saints of God I have a desire the kids parents our siblings every one of us have that experience with God that no one has to keep you you are kept by the power of God musicians if you come I I for the past three to four Services I haven't seemed to get through because I have so much in in my office God just keeps and I just keep typing I ah it's like trying to get water a drink from a fire hydrant there are times brother Mario and brother Mike you guys know you you you'll seek for a sermon and you can't find an anointed verse in the whole Bible ah man what do I do God help me I have to do something to relax my spirit I do otherwise I can't be sensitized and then you know okay God God I I can't seem to find anything anointed I I don't have anything to preach I take my little dog I go to the park I get a little SCH snower fun that dog thinks it was born to chase a ball you get that ball huh you guys ever got a dog like that huh and the dog looks at you like and it's squ and you go and the dog and that dog gets so excited it's little tail it's going like this all a sudden and then you throw it and that dog run and I I've had my dog do a flip in the air to get that ball and I start laughing you silly little hairy dog and my spirit I begin to laugh laughter is as a good medicine and the next thing you know my spirit's a little bit freed up you know what I just got sensitized so now you know what Stephen I now go and I start praying and I start seeking and guess what God does a whole fire Hy and I'm going God not so fast I'm only 38 words per minute I can't type that fast and it just keeps coming I told told Brother Steven MCN this morning I said well I might have some leftovers this morning for the next meal now my wife is the queen of leftovers she can take a meal that I you know what don't put it in the microwave and zap it you know what she does she disguises it she does she takes that meal I had the day before and she adds a little bit of cabbage and a little bit of this and that a little bit of extra sauce and gives it to me and I said wow what a meal honey yeah you ate that yesterday I said no [Music] you and this will not be leftovers to you cuz why I didn't feed it to you so it's going to be fresh food in due season in the next service and I love you guys and I'm thankful you come to church amen [Music] I just wonder how many of you are really listening to the voice of the seventh angel I mean hearing what he has to say yeah when I heard him speak I heard more than a man there was a voice Beyond the Veil amen I said no man spake like this [Music] man brother Mark pagee remember when we first come into the message hey hey hey just a bunch of hippies [Music] and we had such a desire for God that every time we turn the tape on God speak to me we're sitting there and got my long hair and he says Hey long hair on a man huh is wrong long hair and a woman is her glory why did he have to say that my father made me cut my hair my whole life I hated it I wanted long hair I wanted to do my thing so finally when I got old enough and get out of the house I'm going to have long hair and now I come to the [Music] message prise God and my father says it's a [Music] shame yes so I thought well I'll appease myself and say well I'm ashamed and keep my long hair no you he did he convicted me right right amen my hair was to my [Music] shoulders so I got it cut I thought I really did God a service yeah huh I'll show you a picture sometime of my wife and I she was was and she was my girlfriend back then I brought her the message but when I cut my hair you know it was more of a beetle haircut than anything hair over the ears and everything like that I thought it was short huh how many know that God deals with you in increments oh yeah that's good but you can go a little better yeah that dress it's at your knees but you can do better see what I'm saying and God hey thank the Lord that he loves you regardless I remember coming to the we're having a tape service and I cut my hair I wanted everybody hey hey and I walk around the room I was a little bit late hey go God bless you they all look at me they don't see nothing I'm going crazy God bless you God bless you nobody says anything so finally I go over and I had the audacity to turn off I didn't press play I press stop everybody looked at me what are you doing turn back on the isn't anybody going to thank me for cutting my hair no we expected that now shut up sit down and turn on the tea Hallelujah if you think sis that when God gives you Revelation and you quit cutting your hair somebody's going to come congratulate you or you take off your makeup nobody's going to say oh blessed art thou of the Lord no you know what they're going to say good nobody's going to sit there because you know what you're not following a man you're following him amen God bless you thank you saints of God if I could make you acutely aware of what God has happened in this our day and you recognize your day in its message you would see something far more than rules and regulations you will see a relationship between God and man you will see the same God the Hebrews 13 and8 the one that's the same yesterday today and forever and the same one that came down to [Music] Abraham as MDC thank you Lord and he joined himself to Abraham and your name is no longer Abram but Abraham I've given you a portion of of me yes Sarah she no longer be Sarah but Sarah and you know what it changed him I want to ask you who do you think this mzc was when this prophet would preach sermons like who is this mezc what is this attraction on the mountain right who do you say that this [Music] is none other than the revealing of the son of man amen as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the days of the revealing of the son of man and when you catch the Revelation guess what it causes you to get into position amen because that's the final after the New Birth guess what comes adoption adoption is hear ye him this is my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased he served me all these years and I've asked his tutors and his Governors I've asked the pastors that have watched over this young man has he been faithful has he got Revelation what's his report card say yeah hey man this guy is A+ student this guy is Valedictorian this guy [Music] well what about the other guy uh better dig around his tree a few more times CU he ain't got no [Music] fruit what good is a tree in the vineyard if it doesn't bring bring forth fruit what does the husband [Music] say it didn't cumber it at the ground why should I water it and fertilize it and it's fruitless what about you you come to church and got no fruit you know what God will do it's his word why let it but then the one who's taking care of the orchard what does he say give me a little bit more time here's the pastor saying about some unfruitful church members maybe my sermons are not good [Music] enough maybe it's me Lord let me dig around the tree one more [Music] time let me water it a little bit more and let's see if it brings forth fruit because if it doesn't there comes a time it's going to be cut down and cast into the fire of tribulation is that righten then Lord help me how many of you say Lord help me to be fruitful dig around my tree a little bit more I don't want to come to to God huh with one little fruit tree or one little fruit on my [Music] tree stepen I want I want my limbs full I want my limbs so full of fruit that limbs bear down with its weight until everybody huh can pick of the fruit and say it's ripe and it's in its season God bless you this morning I'm not done I'm not done I'm going to let you go home I'm going to let you eat I'm going to let you have time with your family today and then you come back next Sunday and I tell you what I'm going to continue on and we're because the sermon never stops you guys realize that a sermon never stops in fact the ministry never stops that's right the mystery never stops because brother Brenham said the mystery of God is so great it'll take an eternity for God to reveal himself wow I don't know about you but that that just my my little finite brain just it's gone you me to tell me in the Eternal Realms that God will continue to unfold [Music] himself how about his unfolding to you right you've read your Bible before why do you read it again because you in your season of maturity catch things you didn't when you were immature that's right when I was as a child I thought as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I
