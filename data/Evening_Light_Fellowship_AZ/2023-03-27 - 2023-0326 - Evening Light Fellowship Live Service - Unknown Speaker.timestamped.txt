[51:04] likened unto ten virgins
[51:06] which took their lamps and went forth to
[51:09] meet the bridegroom
[51:11] and five of them were wise and five were
[51:14] foolish and they that were foolish took
[51:16] their lamps
[51:18] and took no oil with them
[51:20] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[51:23] with their lamps
[51:24] and while the bridegroom tarried they
[51:27] all slumbered and slept and at midnight
[51:30] there was a cry made behold the
[51:34] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[51:38] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[51:42] their lamps and the fully said unto the
[51:45] wise give us of your oil for our lamps
[51:49] are gone out but the wise answered
[51:52] saying not so lest there be not enough
[51:55] for us and you
[51:57] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[52:00] buy for yourselves and while they went
[52:03] to buy the bridegroom came and they that
[52:07] were ready went in with him to the
[52:10] marriage and the door was shut I want
[52:14] you to notice in
[52:16] they that were ready
[52:24] and they that were ready went in with
[52:27] him to the marriage
[52:30] and the door was shut afterward came the
[52:32] other virgins
[52:34] saying Lord Lord open to us
[52:37] but he answered and said verily I said
[52:39] to you I know you not
[52:42] watch therefore for you no neither the
[52:47] day nor the hour were in the son of man
[52:50] cometh Revelations 19 if you turn with
[52:54] me please while you remain standing
[52:59] Revelation 19
[53:01] verses 5 through 10.
[53:05] and the voice came out of their Throne
[53:08] saying praise our God all ye his
[53:12] servants and he that fear Him both small
[53:16] and great and I heard as it were the
[53:19] voice of a great multitude and as a
[53:22] voice of many Waters and as the voice of
[53:26] Mighty thundering saying Alleluia for
[53:29] the Lord God omnipotent reigneth
[53:33] that let us be glad and rejoice and give
[53:36] honor to him
[53:38] for the marriage of the Lamb is come in
[53:41] his wife hath made herself ready notice
[53:46] that and his wife hath made herself
[53:49] ready amen and to her was granted that
[53:53] she should be arrayed in the fine linen
[53:57] clean and white for the fine linen is
[54:01] the righteousness of saints and he saith
[54:05] unto me right blessed are they which are
[54:07] called unto the marriage supper of the
[54:10] lamb and he saith unto me these are the
[54:14] true sayings of God and I fell at his
[54:17] feet to worship him and he said unto me
[54:19] see thou do it not I am thy fellow
[54:23] servant and of thy Brethren that have
[54:25] the testimony of Jesus worship God
[54:30] for the testimony of Jesus
[54:33] is the spirit of Prophecy father God now
[54:37] in the name of Jesus I ask that same
[54:40] Spirit of Prophecy that was upon John
[54:43] there on the Isle of Patmos
[54:45] when he was told to come up hither
[54:48] immediately he was quickened and got
[54:50] into the spirit I pray heavenly father
[54:52] as you have already came in the early
[54:56] portion in the song service father I
[54:59] pray come let the anointing of that same
[55:02] Holy Spirit Come anoint Thy word Lord I
[55:05] pray and let everyone make themselves
[55:07] ready for your soon coming I pray in
[55:09] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[55:13] you and be seated
[55:14] this morning in the presence of the Lord
[55:18] amen I want to title my sermon get right
[55:21] into it
[55:23] Rapture Ready
[55:26] I don't want to take a title of subject
[55:29] how was your walk with God
[55:33] you know we can talk all kinds of
[55:34] spiritual things we can act
[55:37] religious
[55:39] we can do all of those things we can go
[55:41] to church but I want to know how was
[55:43] your walk with God
[55:45] because it is your daily walk with God
[55:48] that is your measuring post that God
[55:50] measures You by how is your prayer life
[55:53] how is your walk with God how is it that
[55:55] you walk with him daily or is it this
[55:57] three times a day father bless his food

[56:15] where I belong
[56:17] that's where I am strong
[56:19] in your presence Lord
[56:22] rapture
[56:24] ready
[56:28] if the Rapture of the church were to
[56:30] take place at this very moment
[56:32] I want you to ask yourself would I be in
[56:36] that
[56:38] would I be taken would I be going or or
[56:41] have I been being a a little
[56:45] lackadaisical about my walk I I haven't
[56:49] been as fervent as I should
[56:52] oh my brother my sister we are facing
[56:54] the greatest moment of the of the church
[56:57] since the the foundation of the world
[57:01] since the beginning of the creation of
[57:03] God God remember right now in the
[57:06] loudestian age this is the crescendo
[57:09] this is when the Maestro is bringing
[57:12] this to the greatest Crescendo he did
[57:14] all of that he thought of you before the
[57:17] foundation of the world he created the
[57:19] world he he allowed sin to come he
[57:22] allowed the devil to come and do his say
[57:24] Stars fell from heaven there was a great
[57:27] cataclysmic thing but God said it's all
[57:30] under control I'm bringing it back I'm
[57:33] bringing back restoration I'm bringing
[57:35] back reconciliation and today in this
[57:39] hour in the darkest of all times he has
[57:43] shown the greatest light somebody say
[57:46] Amen to that
[57:49] [Applause]
[57:50] and guess what if you've seen that light
[57:53] then you're a part of it if you haven't
[57:55] seen it then I pity you because the next
[57:58] thing that you're going to see is the
[58:01] Tribulation and oh God let everyone
[58:04] that's here let's everyone that has a
[58:07] real seriousness and a consecration with
[58:10] God may you be so serious to say oh God
[58:14] let me be in the catching away
[58:22] are you ready to go with him
[58:26] the Bible says that he shall come as a
[58:28] thief in the night
[58:31] oh if we'd only known what hour he was
[58:34] going to come I would have been ready
[58:37] oh he comes as a thief
[58:40] he has announced he has sent all of his
[58:43] proclamations he has sent his signs he
[58:47] has sent a flashing red lights he has
[58:50] Sent His prophets he has sent his
[58:52] ministries he has sent all of this that
[58:55] you might know the day and the hour in
[58:58] which you live Hallelujah that we've got
[59:01] to be quickened to this hour
[59:04] not looking back to what God has done
[59:07] not looking ahead to what he will do but
[59:09] let us see what God is doing right now
[59:16] brother Branham said in the sermon God
[59:18] hiding in simplicity
[59:22] the church goes through the tribulation
[59:24] but not the bride
[59:27] the church goes through for purification
[59:30] sure under that Sixth Seal right Israel
[59:34] does the same thing for the hundred and
[59:37] forty four thousand but not the bride
[59:40] the brightest forgiven
[59:43] she goes straight to Glory
[59:46] in a Rapture that's right she my opinion
[59:51] the last member will be caught up one of
[59:54] these days it might come and you won't
[59:57] know nothing about it remember it's a
[1:00:01] secret secret catching away he'll come
[1:00:05] in an hour that you think not you won't
[1:00:07] know nothing about it she'll be gone
[1:00:10] be too late then I say oh God let
[1:00:14] everyone that is here Quicken themselves
[1:00:17] this morning to realize the lateness of
[1:00:21] his hour you don't have no time to stray
[1:00:24] you don't have no time to get away from
[1:00:27] the word of God this is the time you've
[1:00:30] got to press the battle this is where
[1:00:32] you've got to go towards the goal oh if
[1:00:36] you're going to fight fight a good fight
[1:00:37] if you're going to run run to win the
[1:00:40] prize
[1:00:43] keep us away from this loudly seeing
[1:00:46] Spirit to want to just be lukewarm
[1:00:49] neither hot nor cold oh God give us
[1:00:52] members who are so on fire for God
[1:00:55] hallelujah
[1:01:00] Enoch is the type of the bride of Christ
[1:01:03] for he is the seventh from Adam a type
[1:01:05] of the seven Church age that is going to
[1:01:08] be caught up
[1:01:09] you know what's interesting about Enoch
[1:01:11] is he never did any miracles
[1:01:14] he never preached a sermon he never did
[1:01:17] anything the Bible does not record
[1:01:19] anything the Bible says and he walked
[1:01:24] with God simply he did something so
[1:01:28] simple most people Overlook it I want to
[1:01:31] ask you this morning how is your walk
[1:01:34] with God
[1:01:39] and he was none
[1:01:41] because God took him
[1:01:48] Walking with God
[1:01:53] think about that for just a moment
[1:01:57] it's a sign of Fellowship
[1:02:01] walking
[1:02:02] is fellowship
[1:02:07] now I want you to notice the Bible says
[1:02:09] in first John 1 and 7. but if we walk in
[1:02:13] the light
[1:02:14] as he is in the light we have Fellowship
[1:02:18] one with another
[1:02:21] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[1:02:23] cleanses us from all sin my brother and
[1:02:27] sister I want to ask you are you walking
[1:02:29] in the light
[1:02:31] and I'll tell you just get around
[1:02:32] somebody and talk to them and if they're
[1:02:35] talking to you about the Phoenix Suns or
[1:02:39] some kind of football team basketball
[1:02:41] team or who's doing this or that I could
[1:02:44] care less
[1:02:46] do you hear me I could care less so I
[1:02:49] don't want to hear about that I really
[1:02:51] don't want to hear about your business I
[1:02:53] want to hear how is your walk with God I
[1:02:56] want to know have you been eating of God
[1:03:00] have you been eating that word where
[1:03:01] that word so stimulates you Hallelujah
[1:03:05] that everything in your mind
[1:03:07] Hallelujah is it is is coming to the
[1:03:11] place I want to be right with God
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:21] when you walk with God you have
[1:03:23] fellowship with God when you walk in the
[1:03:25] light
[1:03:27] you have fellowship with God
[1:03:29] amen
[1:03:32] Romans 6 verse 4 therefore we are buried
[1:03:35] with him by baptism into death
[1:03:39] that like as Christ was raised from the
[1:03:41] dead by the glory of the father even so
[1:03:45] also we also should walk in newness of
[1:03:50] life
[1:03:51] Hallelujah newness of life because old
[1:03:55] things have been passed away and all
[1:03:57] things have become new I'm not worried
[1:04:00] about what you did back then I don't
[1:04:02] want to hear about the old you I want to
[1:04:04] hear about the new you I want to hear
[1:04:06] about the resurrected you I want to hear
[1:04:08] about the one who was raised from the
[1:04:11] dead I want to hear about you that was
[1:04:14] raised in a resurrected Ministry
[1:04:17] hallelujah how many believe that he is
[1:04:19] the resurrection he is the life when you
[1:04:22] get into Christ
[1:04:25] yeah
[1:04:27] it is not a religion it is a
[1:04:30] relationship it is a love affair between
[1:04:33] you and God it is not lighting candles
[1:04:36] it is not pressing play it is getting in
[1:04:39] where your life Hallelujah you're
[1:04:41] feeding it is a one way between you and
[1:04:44] God
[1:04:47] come on
[1:04:50] your conduct and your behavior right now
[1:04:55] either convicts you
[1:04:57] as a Believer or convict you as an
[1:05:00] unbeliever
[1:05:01] is there enough evidence in your life
[1:05:04] right now for somebody to say I can tell
[1:05:07] by the fruits he's a believer
[1:05:10] oh God help us to live a life
[1:05:17] amen
[1:05:20] I want you to judge yourself this
[1:05:22] morning
[1:05:23] how
[1:05:25] is your walk with God
[1:05:29] oh God why do you have this burning in
[1:05:33] my soul this morning
[1:05:36] am I here to just warn your people
[1:05:39] oh but God I pray that each one will
[1:05:43] take this as a solemn morning
[1:05:46] I want you to to know he's coming
[1:05:50] he's coming
[1:05:51] are you ready for his coming
[1:05:57] Romans
[1:05:58] 8 4 that the righteousness
[1:06:01] of the law
[1:06:03] might be fulfilled in US
[1:06:07] who walk not after the flesh
[1:06:10] but after the spirit
[1:06:15] Walk With Me Lord
[1:06:18] on the road to Emmaus they were walking
[1:06:22] and you know they were walking and he
[1:06:24] was there he was there with them
[1:06:26] and I and the Bible says in her eyes
[1:06:29] were holding that they didn't know
[1:06:32] oh God I wonder how many today
[1:06:35] on that road to Emmaus he's been walking
[1:06:39] with you
[1:06:40] he's been right beside you he's been
[1:06:44] leading you and guiding you and you
[1:06:46] haven't your eyes are not open
[1:06:49] oh my Emmaus means
[1:06:52] a place of strong desire
[1:06:57] a place of earnest desire
[1:07:00] oh if we would have that Earnest desire
[1:07:03] this morning and we would walk with him
[1:07:06] and we would just say oh God if I'm not
[1:07:10] recognizing you're here Open the Eyes of
[1:07:14] My Heart Lord
[1:07:16] and the Bible says and he made as though
[1:07:18] he would go further
[1:07:20] let me tell you if you are just fleeing
[1:07:22] this morning with God he will move on
[1:07:25] he is a god he's an omniscient God he's
[1:07:30] omnipotent he's omniscient he's
[1:07:33] omnipresent but my brother my sister he
[1:07:37] doesn't play
[1:07:38] he's God and you need to have respects
[1:07:42] towards God because one of these days
[1:07:45] his grace and his Mercy will turn to
[1:07:49] wrath into judgment I say run run now
[1:07:53] into his grace right now while there's
[1:07:56] yet the door open because the door will
[1:07:59] soon shut
[1:08:03] Galatians 5 16 then
[1:08:06] I say walk in the spirit
[1:08:09] and you shall not fulfill the last
[1:08:12] of the flesh that's the problem you are
[1:08:16] filled too much with Instagram you are
[1:08:19] filled too much with Facebook you are
[1:08:21] filled too much with the other things
[1:08:23] and your mind is cluttered up I tell you
[1:08:26] let us steadfastly set our face towards
[1:08:29] Jerusalem if you got the Rapture on the
[1:08:32] horizon it ought to be on you in the
[1:08:34] morning it ought to be you on you in the
[1:08:37] noon time it ought to be on your mind
[1:08:39] when you go to bed at night Hallelujah
[1:08:42] brother Warren you just was down in
[1:08:44] Veracruz and you preached the gospel 10
[1:08:46] people came in oh Hallelujah and they
[1:08:49] got baptized I tell you oh God one of
[1:08:52] these days the last one the last one's
[1:08:55] gonna come in and we're going to get out
[1:08:57] of here they might be here this morning
[1:09:03] I'm on something this morning
[1:09:06] the spirit of God is on me
[1:09:09] and I'm on your case if you aren't in
[1:09:11] the place that you're at the hound dog
[1:09:14] is on you he's got you smell down he's
[1:09:18] got the nose of the spirit he knows
[1:09:21] where you have
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:26] yes sir I'm on your case and I hey you
[1:09:30] can run but you cannot hide
[1:09:32] [Applause]
[1:09:39] Hallelujah
[1:09:41] somebody say I love him
[1:09:43] amen and if you love him you serve him
[1:09:46] amen because if you don't serve him
[1:09:48] you're not in love with him
[1:09:51] amen he said if you love me
[1:09:53] you keep my Commandments that's why we
[1:09:56] do what we do that's why we live the way
[1:09:59] we live not because of fire insurance if
[1:10:03] you're serving God because you're afraid
[1:10:05] of going to hell
[1:10:06] let me tell you you need to serve God
[1:10:10] because you're in love with him
[1:10:12] amen not for some fire Insurance because
[1:10:14] you're afraid of going to hell no I'll
[1:10:17] tell you what the Bible says that the
[1:10:19] goodness of God leads thee to repentance
[1:10:21] if God ever put it on your heart to get
[1:10:24] right I tell you move quickly move
[1:10:27] quickly why because the door is quickly
[1:10:31] shutting and one day when the door is
[1:10:34] shut
[1:10:35] and it's over and they that were ready
[1:10:41] went in
[1:10:44] and those that were not ready
[1:10:47] I ask you are you ready
[1:10:49] are you Rapture Ready this morning
[1:10:56] amen now walking in the Bible is a sign
[1:10:58] of Fellowship
[1:11:01] it is a type of a person that's obedient
[1:11:04] to what they have heard preached
[1:11:06] without Revelation it's impossible to
[1:11:09] serve God
[1:11:16] Ephesians 2 and 2 says we're in times
[1:11:19] past you walked according to the course
[1:11:21] of this world
[1:11:23] according to the prince of the power of
[1:11:26] the air
[1:11:27] the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:11:30] children of Disobedience you want to see
[1:11:32] why those people out there are acting
[1:11:34] the way they do
[1:11:36] you want to know why they are all
[1:11:38] tattooed up why they color their hair
[1:11:40] why they do the things that they do they
[1:11:43] are doing The Works of their father
[1:11:46] do you understand it is the spirit of
[1:11:49] Disobedience that's why they look at you
[1:11:51] and they think you're crazy they look at
[1:11:53] you and think that you're out of this
[1:11:55] world oh you are out of this world you
[1:11:58] don't belong to this Cosmos you don't
[1:12:00] belong to this Kingdom my kingdom Jesus
[1:12:03] said is not of this world if it were of
[1:12:07] this world you couldn't crucify me you
[1:12:09] couldn't stop me but because my kingdom
[1:12:12] is not of this world and he said in you
[1:12:15] that are here you're going to have
[1:12:17] trials you're going to have tribulations
[1:12:19] and understand but I will be with you
[1:12:21] even in you till the end of the world
[1:12:27] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:12:30] Lord
[1:12:34] the Bible says in second Corinthians 5
[1:12:36] and 7
[1:12:37] for we walk by faith
[1:12:40] not by sight oh God help wean us
[1:12:45] help wean us away from all of the carnal
[1:12:49] eyesight from all of the carnal thinking
[1:12:52] from all of the five carnal senses why
[1:12:56] because that only causes you to
[1:12:58] recognize what's happening around you oh
[1:13:01] but God give me a portion of Faith this
[1:13:04] morning let me look Beyond this realm
[1:13:08] look let me look into the Realms of God
[1:13:11] let me see that angels are walking up
[1:13:14] and down these aisles let me see that
[1:13:16] they're hanging on the walls that God is
[1:13:19] there God omnipotent is ready to
[1:13:22] orchestrate the final move Hallelujah
[1:13:26] are you Rapture Ready
[1:13:29] Hallelujah
[1:13:36] the question is has been asked
[1:13:39] because Jesus said I want you to be
[1:13:41] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[1:13:44] perfect
[1:13:45] how many of you realize that in your
[1:13:48] flesh
[1:13:49] you'll never be perfected
[1:13:52] oh you've tried you've tried to keep
[1:13:54] every commandment you tried to do that
[1:13:57] which is right but I realized my
[1:14:00] perfection is not coming in this flesh I
[1:14:03] fall on a daily basis I think wrong on a
[1:14:06] daily basis but I have an advocate
[1:14:09] before the father I have blood that
[1:14:12] stands between me and God why I said God
[1:14:15] I accept my blood I accept your your
[1:14:18] sacrifice and because of that God's not
[1:14:21] looking at me he's looking at the blood
[1:14:28] I walk not by sight
[1:14:31] but by faith
[1:14:33] amen
[1:14:38] the question has been asked do you get
[1:14:41] your perfecting from the the tapes or
[1:14:43] how about the fivefold ministry let me
[1:14:46] tell you it's neither one of them
[1:14:48] it's not just listening to tapes it's
[1:14:51] not just the ministry it is a
[1:14:53] combination of the both and it must be
[1:14:56] the Holy Ghost movie when you hear the
[1:14:59] tape it's to them who have an ear
[1:15:03] to hear what the spirit is saying amen
[1:15:07] it's not just the ministry the ministry
[1:15:10] is a tool in the hand of God it's not to
[1:15:13] minister it's not the Apostle Prophet
[1:15:16] evangelism who is it it's God it's God
[1:15:19] himself he's the ones perfecting the
[1:15:22] church
[1:15:22] [Music]
[1:15:28] questions and answers 1964 watch this
[1:15:31] here watch this question
[1:15:33] dearly beloved this is Brother Brandon's
[1:15:35] Reedy about the scripture of Ephesians 4
[1:15:39] 11-13
[1:15:42] do we all let's see
[1:15:44] do we get all the perfecting of saints
[1:15:46] through the tapes
[1:15:49] or should we be here
[1:15:51] where the gifts of the Spirit are
[1:15:53] operating in different offices of the
[1:15:55] church to help perfect us
[1:15:58] our hearts have believed all the word of
[1:16:01] the Lord
[1:16:02] and he goes on talks about a guy from
[1:16:05] Oregon
[1:16:06] and he says no
[1:16:08] they want to come here to church for the
[1:16:11] perfecting see
[1:16:13] that we get
[1:16:15] Fellowship one with another here at
[1:16:17] church
[1:16:18] but the perfecting
[1:16:20] comes between us
[1:16:23] and God
[1:16:28] the blood of Christ
[1:16:30] is what perfects us
[1:16:33] in the Holy Spirit
[1:16:35] do you see that
[1:16:39] it is not by your righteousness
[1:16:43] it is not by you keeping the Commandment
[1:16:46] but it's because God
[1:16:49] rich in Mercy a God knowing you couldn't
[1:16:53] keep it a god-knowing Abraham could not
[1:16:57] keep it so he gave Abraham an
[1:16:59] unconditional Covenant Abraham it's not
[1:17:02] what you do it's not how good you are
[1:17:05] it's not how you walk Abraham it's
[1:17:09] because I have made a covenant and it's
[1:17:12] unconditional I don't care what you do
[1:17:15] you can be a lion Prophet you can give
[1:17:17] your wife away you can do the things
[1:17:19] wrong you can get out of the will of God
[1:17:21] you can get into the wrong spot but
[1:17:24] guess what I will bring you to where I'm
[1:17:27] going to bring you Hallelujah
[1:17:31] oh saints of God you quit worrying about
[1:17:34] what God on whether or not he can bring
[1:17:37] you to where he's going to bring you it
[1:17:39] seems like at times I hit plateaus
[1:17:44] you know what you need you need a
[1:17:46] breakthrough
[1:17:50] that's what happens when you get on a
[1:17:51] diet you sit there and you go and you go
[1:17:54] and you lose a few and a few and until
[1:17:56] you plateau you know what they tell you
[1:17:58] to do you need to you need to press
[1:18:00] through you need to do something
[1:18:02] different Hallelujah that's what we need
[1:18:05] to do we need to press through this
[1:18:07] morning we need each one of you to say
[1:18:09] I'm gonna do some I'm going to press
[1:18:11] harder
[1:18:18] it must be a combination it's not just
[1:18:21] fling tapes
[1:18:22] oh I tell you what I don't know about
[1:18:24] any of you that love that voice more
[1:18:26] than I
[1:18:29] oh there's some about that voice every
[1:18:31] time I put that tape on
[1:18:34] good evening Saints I greet you in the
[1:18:36] name of Jesus there's no flash there's
[1:18:39] no Hollywood evangelism about it there's
[1:18:42] no Flair what it is it's in the humility
[1:18:46] and in the character and virtue of Jesus
[1:18:49] Christ no wonder I love the prophet
[1:18:53] because he loved him one of the most
[1:18:56] wonderful quotes I ever read
[1:18:58] brother Branham says oh Lord let the
[1:19:01] people love me
[1:19:04] Lord let the people love me that I can
[1:19:06] bring them to you
[1:19:09] God I don't care to be popular I don't
[1:19:12] care to be the most popular Pastor I
[1:19:14] don't care to have all of the big things
[1:19:16] no I'll tell you what if there's
[1:19:18] anything that I could do to you to
[1:19:21] provoke you under good works and to get
[1:19:22] you closer to Christ that's my greatest
[1:19:25] desire
[1:19:27] I'm not worried about your business
[1:19:29] it'll perish I'm not worried about your
[1:19:32] house you may not have it tomorrow I'm
[1:19:35] not worried about your car because you
[1:19:37] might have to walk and maybe walking
[1:19:39] will be good for you
[1:19:41] because a Enoch
[1:19:44] walked
[1:19:46] with God
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:50] I need some of you to start walking
[1:19:54] amen walk with God are you Rapture Ready
[1:20:02] all right
[1:20:05] the ministry is not perfecting the bride
[1:20:08] how dare I take any of that to myself
[1:20:11] oh I couldn't help a a fly with a
[1:20:15] headache
[1:20:16] I can't get anybody into position
[1:20:20] oh but if God has ever used me if God
[1:20:24] has ever Anointed The Gift
[1:20:27] it's because I got myself out of the way
[1:20:30] brother Ram said the greatest gift that
[1:20:33] I have as a ministers get himself out of
[1:20:36] the way even one time he said to Pope
[1:20:40] and he's saying you all know what I'm
[1:20:41] waiting for and I'm waiting for him he
[1:20:45] said because if he don't come by he said
[1:20:48] then it's useless our meeting has been
[1:20:50] in vain he said maybe I said something
[1:20:53] wrong maybe I said a joke maybe I was
[1:20:57] talking about you know talking to my son
[1:21:00] oh you know who the greatest man that
[1:21:02] came out of Kentucky and Daniel Boone
[1:21:05] and Davy Crockett and your daddy in you
[1:21:08] know he laughs a little bit what was
[1:21:10] wrong with that I ask you Saints
[1:21:13] what was wrong with that
[1:21:16] that this daddy would maybe boast a
[1:21:18] little bit
[1:21:19] and your daddy came out of Kentucky
[1:21:25] but he was so conscientious oh if I made
[1:21:28] myself above you Lord
[1:21:31] if I made myself something great Lord
[1:21:34] I'm just a Kentucky hillbilly
[1:21:37] he said father I don't even have the
[1:21:40] ability I don't have
[1:21:42] I don't have education
[1:21:44] I didn't finish seventh grade
[1:21:48] he says I sit down with great monarchs
[1:21:50] and kings
[1:21:52] and he says in the he says I don't know
[1:21:55] which Fork to use for the salad
[1:21:58] I don't know how to cut my meat I don't
[1:22:00] know the etiquette
[1:22:03] and he said oh Father forgive me
[1:22:06] he says I don't have the eloquence of
[1:22:08] speech
[1:22:09] like Moses
[1:22:12] but you know what God Said
[1:22:14] you speak the way you are they will
[1:22:18] understand how many of you have heard
[1:22:20] him and and in butcher up the English
[1:22:22] language and and hate and taint and
[1:22:25] fetch and tote and all these things but
[1:22:28] you knew you know what he did not speak
[1:22:31] the queen's English he spoke The King's
[1:22:34] English Hallelujah

[1:26:24] God but you know what
[1:26:27] every mistake
[1:26:30] you must learn by it
[1:26:33] huh
[1:26:35] member Eugene Braun preaching that
[1:26:38] sermon I'll feel forward I'm not going
[1:26:40] to fail and go backward
[1:26:43] I'm going forward when I fall
[1:26:45] I'm going to lean forward amen when that
[1:26:48] when I'm getting tackled they got my
[1:26:50] like this and I got that football in my
[1:26:52] hand what am I going to do I'm going to
[1:26:54] reach out and I'm going to get
[1:26:56] hallelujah hallelujah do you understand
[1:26:59] when that guy is running towards the
[1:27:01] goal line and they got the Defenders
[1:27:03] coming you know what he's doing he's
[1:27:05] determined he's gonna go across the goal
[1:27:08] and he reaches and he lunges and he puts
[1:27:10] the ball over the goal line Hallelujah
[1:27:14] God help us I want you to reach I want
[1:27:18] you to run I want you to fight and then
[1:27:21] I want you to do it with purpose
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:30] perseverance I didn't give you the quote
[1:27:32] let's go perseverance
[1:27:34] I believe that there's a church coming
[1:27:36] into that perfection
[1:27:39] that Ministry of perfection
[1:27:41] where the offices Apostles prophets
[1:27:44] teachers pastors evangelists for the
[1:27:47] perfecting the church them pastors and
[1:27:49] teachers and so forth will be so with
[1:27:52] the word until the whole thing will work
[1:27:54] right up
[1:27:55] to the coming of the Lord I believe that
[1:27:59] I believe we're nearing that time
[1:28:02] now
[1:28:05] 1964.
[1:28:07] they were nearing that time
[1:28:09] now yeah
[1:28:11] Enoch was walking by Train by by
[1:28:14] Revelation there must be Revelation
[1:28:17] prior to translation
[1:28:22] amen Israel and the church 1953 I truly
[1:28:27] believe before the church can have the
[1:28:30] Rapture it's got to have rapturing faith
[1:28:33] we can't even have faith for Divine
[1:28:35] Healing let alone rapturing faith got to
[1:28:38] have a faith that'll change and Quicken
[1:28:40] this body and be taken away I believe
[1:28:43] there's a church
[1:28:44] watch this prophecy
[1:28:46] you want to hear what Elijah said you
[1:28:49] want to hear the spirit of Prophecy
[1:28:52] I believe there's a church on the road
[1:28:54] tonight
[1:28:55] a power of the Living God that men will
[1:28:58] speak the word here and there and it'll
[1:29:01] flash like lightning the church is
[1:29:04] coming out not a psychologist not some
[1:29:06] sort of put on make-believe but a real
[1:29:08] true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called
[1:29:11] out Church
[1:29:12] somebody say that's me
[1:29:19] watch Brethren said God's doing it
[1:29:22] it's not you doing it it's God doing it
[1:29:24] every time the word was spoke in the
[1:29:27] third pole Ministry it was sovereignly
[1:29:29] given you don't have to work it up you
[1:29:32] don't have to put yourself down because
[1:29:34] you when you look at the sovereignty of
[1:29:36] the the third pull you know what it was
[1:29:39] years sometimes in between one event to
[1:29:41] the next
[1:29:43] how many how many miracles did Elijah do
[1:29:47] in his all of his years
[1:29:49] how many did Elisha do
[1:29:53] it isn't something done every week it is
[1:29:55] in speaking this speaking that it isn't
[1:29:58] driving your car down let every light be
[1:30:01] green thus saith the Lord are you
[1:30:04] kidding me God don't waste his time on
[1:30:07] green lights
[1:30:08] God don't waste his time on carnal
[1:30:11] things I'll tell you what may you have a
[1:30:13] green light in the spirit it's time to
[1:30:15] go to church I got it it's time to get
[1:30:17] on your knees I got it it's time to get
[1:30:20] a hold of the spirit I got it it's time
[1:30:23] to get into this I got it Hallelujah are
[1:30:27] you with me now he said this third pull
[1:30:31] it's so Sovereign he said it means a lot
[1:30:34] of my uh letting go and giving away oh
[1:30:40] that means all of us also
[1:30:42] give way to those things those carnal
[1:30:45] things that don't matter
[1:30:51] it's God doing
[1:30:53] he that began to work in you
[1:30:55] what will he do
[1:30:57] he'll finish it
[1:30:59] how many believe that
[1:31:01] he's not a quick start
[1:31:03] oh some of you are so hard-headed and
[1:31:05] some of you are slow
[1:31:07] but I'll tell you what my daughter
[1:31:09] shared with me this the other day she
[1:31:11] said you know what Daddy
[1:31:12] she said in the ark they had all kinds
[1:31:15] of animals they had jaguars leopards
[1:31:18] cheetahs they had different things they
[1:31:21] had elephants slow lumbering elephants
[1:31:24] but you know what when the spirit of God
[1:31:26] are you listening to me when the spirit
[1:31:28] of God began to pull they two by two
[1:31:31] began to go and walk towards the ark and
[1:31:35] I'll tell you what the cheetah he might
[1:31:37] have been the first one there why he
[1:31:40] runs faster than all the rest but I'll
[1:31:42] tell you what while the cheetah is
[1:31:44] already getting in the ark here come the
[1:31:46] little turtle
[1:31:48] I'm on my way
[1:31:51] I'm on my way
[1:31:53] Hallelujah yes some of you are turtles
[1:31:56] some are you are big lumbering elephants
[1:31:58] but I tell you what God ain't closing
[1:32:01] the door until the last one is in
[1:32:04] Hallelujah
[1:32:06] blessed be the name of the Lord just
[1:32:09] keep moving keep moving
[1:32:12] [Applause]

[1:36:21] couple of words before I close I'll
[1:36:22] bypass the rest of these scriptures
[1:36:25] maybe sometimes get to them but I want
[1:36:27] to say this we believe that we're at the
[1:36:29] end time
[1:36:29] we believe in and though it seems like
[1:36:32] at the end time at this time that the
[1:36:35] message in messenger is both about broke
[1:36:40] oh my
[1:36:42] seems like
[1:36:44] we got more trouble than we've ever had
[1:36:47] seems like we got more trials than we
[1:36:50] ever had it seems like the messenger and
[1:36:54] the message that's just about broke a
[1:36:58] little bit bankrupt man I ain't got
[1:37:00] nothing I've done spin it all come on

[1:37:22] like
[1:37:24] the message and the message just about
[1:37:26] broke
[1:37:30] what good is all the years of Ministry
[1:37:33] of telling the people where they're from
[1:37:35] and their name

[1:38:42] at that time when God steps in on the
[1:38:46] sea of something he's been watching for
[1:38:50] a long long long long long long time
[1:38:54] Hallelujah guess what God is fixing to
[1:38:57] do something why it's been a long time

[1:47:33] we must prioritize Our Lives
[1:47:37] focus on what is most important
[1:47:40] let me give you a scriptural example
[1:47:42] Kingdom of Heaven in Matthew 22 verses 2
[1:47:45] through 5.
[1:47:47] the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a
[1:47:50] certain King which made a marriage for
[1:47:52] his son
[1:47:54] and send forth his servants
[1:47:57] to call them that were bitten to the
[1:47:59] wedding
[1:48:01] and they
[1:48:03] would not come
[1:48:09] again he sent forth other servants
[1:48:12] saying tell them that are bidden
[1:48:16] behold I have prepared my dinner
[1:48:19] my oxen my fattening are killed
[1:48:23] and all things are ready
[1:48:26] come unto the marriage
[1:48:29] and they made light of it
[1:48:32] and they went their ways one to his farm
[1:48:34] another to his merchandise
[1:48:38] see they made light of it
[1:48:40] I wonder how many people today
[1:48:43] are making light of this
[1:48:45] well we heard about his coming all these
[1:48:47] years
[1:48:48] we've heard and you know this and that
[1:48:52] well they one by one the Bible says in
[1:48:55] Luke 14 let me follow along just before
[1:48:57] I close
[1:48:58] Luke 14 verses 16 through 24.
[1:49:01] they said in him a certain man had a
[1:49:03] great supper
[1:49:05] and bade many sent his servants at
[1:49:08] supper time
[1:49:10] to say unto them that were bidden come
[1:49:13] for all things are now ready
[1:49:16] and they all with one consent began to
[1:49:19] make excuse
[1:49:22] the first said unto him I've bought a
[1:49:24] piece of land
[1:49:27] or a piece of ground and I must needs go
[1:49:29] see it I pray thee have me excused
[1:49:32] don't let real estate stop you Saints

[1:49:56] business opportunity
[1:49:58] and he gave me a promotion
[1:50:01] oh I I you know as soon as I make some
[1:50:04] money enough to retire I'll be all right

[1:51:04] the Kingdom of Heaven is like an unto a
[1:51:07] man
[1:51:08] who is throwing a marriage supper
[1:51:10] and he sent his servants and he and he
[1:51:13] went and he he went to those that were

[1:51:46] so that servant came and showed his Lord
[1:51:48] to these things then the master of the
[1:51:50] house being angry said to his servant
[1:51:52] go out quickly to the streets and Lanes
[1:51:54] of the city and bring in hither the poor
[1:51:57] and the maimed and the Halt and the
[1:51:59] Blind and the servant said Lord it is
[1:52:01] done as thou is commanded yet there is
[1:52:03] room
[1:52:06] the Lord said on the servant go on to
[1:52:08] the highways
[1:52:09] and hedges
[1:52:11] tell them to come in
[1:52:13] that my house may be filled

[1:52:23] shall taste of my supper
[1:52:27] what a poor excuse
[1:52:31] brother random
[1:52:33] now before I give you this quote
[1:52:36] let me let me say you as a pastor right
[1:52:38] now what I feel God is doing
[1:52:40] he's compelling the last ones that come
[1:52:42] in
[1:52:47] he's compelling now
[1:52:55] it's not them waiting for a sign
[1:53:00] it's not them waiting till La sinks and
[1:53:03] then they get serious
[1:53:06] right now
[1:53:08] by a still
[1:53:10] small
[1:53:11] voice
[1:53:12] that has been calling you
[1:53:15] since you're a little bitty baby
[1:53:18] and he's been calling you and wooing you
[1:53:21] and asking you to come
[1:53:26] I remember in
[1:53:28] 1969 I was a counselor for Billy Graham
[1:53:31] crusade Anaheim California
[1:53:33] Anaheim Convention Center the largest
[1:53:36] youth convention Billy Graham has ever
[1:53:38] had in the course of his ministry
[1:53:42] and if any of you have ever met Billy
[1:53:44] Graham or come close to him I was about
[1:53:46] from here
[1:53:47] to brother Jimmy Tempe in the back of
[1:53:49] the church that's about how far I was
[1:53:51] away from him brother Jim
[1:53:53] and when he made the the call to come
[1:53:56] forward
[1:53:58] and they were playing that song Just As
[1:54:01] I Am Without One Plea and here was Billy
[1:54:07] Graham I knew he was a great man there
[1:54:10] was such a an aura
[1:54:13] sauna about him

[1:54:19] the the up in the balconies and you hear
[1:54:22] he says every time that Christ bid his
[1:54:26] disciples to come he had them do a
[1:54:29] public show Christ is bidding you right

[1:54:34] I want you to come yes that's it my
[1:54:36] brother my sister and Billy Graham says

[1:54:41] calls in America today and and here and
[1:54:44] you saw the people coming oh my let me
[1:54:47] tell you I believe my brother my sister
[1:54:49] what God is doing right now as he's

[1:55:16] hardly wait
[1:55:18] no it wasn't Gaithers
[1:55:20] is another old-time God and they say I
[1:55:22] can hardly wait to enter the gate can't
[1:55:25] you hear those shouting sounds
[1:55:28] tell you what
[1:55:29] listen listen
[1:55:31] can you hear him
[1:55:33] they're across the border
[1:55:37] they're screaming and they're shouting
[1:55:40] Hallelujah come God omnipotent Reina
[1:55:44] there's shouting sounds all over because
[1:55:47] the closer I get to the gate I can
[1:55:49] hardly wait
[1:55:51] to hear those shums out amen
[1:55:55] but until then what I do as a minister I
[1:55:58] say Okay God God
[1:56:00] it's only by your spirit because the
[1:56:02] Bible says that the presence of God
[1:56:05] and the goodness of God leads you to
[1:56:07] repentance it's not somebody leading you
[1:56:10] come up here brother sister no
[1:56:12] it's that still Small Voice and you know
[1:56:15] whether or not you that you have
[1:56:17] committed your life to Christ or not
[1:56:19] watch this perseverance
[1:56:23] when that Rapture takes place it'll be a
[1:56:25] change
[1:56:27] and the first thing you know that change
[1:56:29] that you're caught up into and gone away
[1:56:33] and the sleeping virgin it moves right
[1:56:35] on just the same
[1:56:36] thinking everywhere everything's going
[1:56:39] fine
[1:56:40] and they're already gone it's already
[1:56:42] happened and you knew it not I don't say
[1:56:45] like it'll be like that Romero I'm not
[1:56:48] saying the Lord tells me it'll be that
[1:56:50] way but I believe it's so close at hand
[1:56:51] it's possible
[1:56:53] I don't want to take any chance I want
[1:56:56] to be ready I want everything ready I
[1:57:00] don't want the weight
[1:57:02] later the weight laid aside whether how
[1:57:05] it comes
[1:57:07] probably the way we got it all drawn out
[1:57:09] will be different
[1:57:11] it's always
[1:57:13] is than what it's been planned his first
[1:57:16] coming was that way in the second coming
[1:57:19] will probably be the same thing
[1:57:21] let's pray now let's be sincere have you
[1:57:25] been caught up in the revelation
[1:57:29] because it'll be you to be caught up in
[1:57:32] the Revelation before you're caught up
[1:57:33] in the translation
[1:57:36] you have to be changed into the newness
[1:57:38] of life
[1:57:40] before you change dimensions
[1:57:44] musicians
[1:57:47] come on up
[1:57:50] I'm not done
[1:57:52] I'm not done
[1:57:55] almost but I'm not
[1:57:58] Enoch walked with God he walked
[1:58:01] differently didn't he
[1:58:03] so this walk was not just walking up
[1:58:05] right on two feet because there was
[1:58:07] millions of people walking
[1:58:10] and it says he walked with God
[1:58:18] what about you have you been walking
[1:58:20] with God lately
[1:58:22] when was the last time that you got
[1:58:24] alone and God Alone
[1:58:26] with God in your prayer closet
[1:58:31] when was the last time that you took a
[1:58:33] walk
[1:58:36] and he just said Walk With Me Lord
[1:58:41] amen walking is fellowship
[1:58:43] sometimes you can walk with a buddy and
[1:58:45] a friend and you're hiking and Elias you
[1:58:48] can be walking down for miles and not
[1:58:50] say a word
[1:58:51] and you've had wonderful Fellowship
[1:58:53] while you were just walking you were
[1:58:56] together with your friend your buddy
[1:59:06] Walk With Me Lord
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:13] Walk With Me Lord
[1:59:16] come
[1:59:16] [Music]
[1:59:18] in the trials walk with me
[1:59:20] in the fire
[1:59:23] walk with me through the flood
[1:59:27] Walk With Me Lord is that your desire
[1:59:33] he'll walk with you right now
[1:59:36] if you'll ask him
[1:59:38] if you will be so sincerest to say
[1:59:41] Walk With Me Lord
[1:59:44] I I've been straying I I kind of been
[1:59:47] doing my own thing
[1:59:50] the cares of life and different things
[1:59:52] just
[1:59:54] walk with me
[1:59:55] [Music]
[2:00:02] [Music]
[2:00:09] [Music]
[2:00:11] let me share with you another scripture
[2:00:13] Galatians
[2:00:15] six seven through nine be not deceived
[2:00:21] God is Not mocked
[2:00:25] for whatsoever a man soweth
[2:00:29] that shall we reap
[2:00:33] for he that sought to the flesh shall
[2:00:35] have the flesh reap corruption
[2:00:38] but he that soweth through the spirit
[2:00:40] shall of the spirit reap life
[2:00:42] Everlasting
[2:00:44] let us not be weary in well-doing
[2:00:48] for in due season we shall reap if we
[2:00:52] faint not
[2:00:55] I looked up the word so to sow
[2:00:59] that's used
[2:01:00] 53 times in the scriptures talks about
[2:01:04] sowing
[2:01:07] 43 times it means to scatter seed
[2:01:12] Zara
[2:01:14] z-a-r-a Zara to sow seed
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:19] please
[2:01:23] where it means also
[2:01:26] to become pregnant
[2:01:27] [Music]
[2:01:32] 43 times it is used the word Spiro which
[2:01:36] means just sowing seed
[2:01:40] only four times in the Bible
[2:01:43] [Music]
[2:01:45] it's Zara
[2:01:48] to receive seed as becoming pregnant
[2:01:52] and Zara is close to Sarah
[2:01:58] was she not receiving Abraham's seat
[2:02:01] years
[2:02:03] from their youth onward in no child no
[2:02:05] child no no conception
[2:02:10] but when faith
[2:02:13] came into the Bible says and Sarah
[2:02:15] having received Faith to conceive see
[2:02:19] Zara
[2:02:22] to absolutely conceive the message how
[2:02:26] many message Believers have been hearing
[2:02:29] sermon after sermon going to church and
[2:02:32] doing this and that going to youth
[2:02:34] meetings and everything but they're not
[2:02:37] manifesting or conceiving this message
[2:02:40] in their life
[2:02:42] why they've not let it conceive
[2:02:46] it's not mental
[2:02:47] [Music]
[2:02:49] in the womb of your mind
[2:02:53] Let It Go Beyond and then let it have
[2:02:57] the bedding ground of your heart
[2:02:59] Thy word oh God if I hid in my heart
[2:03:03] that I learned not to sin against you
[2:03:10] so
[2:03:13] sowing seed is not just giving out
[2:03:17] but four times he refers to
[2:03:20] to conceive seed
[2:03:23] so the majority of the time
[2:03:26] in the sowing of seed is actually meant
[2:03:29] to be are you receiving it
[2:03:33] are you listening this word
[2:03:37] to receive seed
[2:03:39] so many people have gone to church in
[2:03:41] church and heard sermon after sermon and
[2:03:44] their life has never changed
[2:03:49] change my heart oh God
[2:03:51] [Music]
[2:03:56] oh God
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:04:03] I want to ask you have you been
[2:04:06] sowing to the flesh
[2:04:08] [Music]
[2:04:09] only you answered that
[2:04:12] well no wonder
[2:04:15] you're reaping such corruption around
[2:04:17] you
[2:04:18] it's the law of God be not deceived
[2:04:21] do not mock God
[2:04:26] for if you sow to the wind you shall
[2:04:28] reap a whirlwind
[2:04:30] what if you shall sow to the spirit so I
[2:04:33] want to ask you you that have come to
[2:04:35] church this morning
[2:04:37] are you receiving the seed
[2:04:40] saying brother Ron I take it to heart
[2:04:42] what you just said
[2:04:45] let it conceive in me
[2:04:48] let this message become alive
[2:04:51] in me let it come out of the books and
[2:04:54] off of the tapes
[2:04:55] huh
[2:04:58] let it become a living entity
[2:05:01] let it become living vessels that each
[2:05:04] one of us would become living Epistles a
[2:05:07] book

[2:05:12] Seven Seals wide those Seven Seals is
