[26:21] we greet you all in lovely name of our
[26:24] Lord Jesus Christ
[26:26] as we remain standing
[26:29] to read a word
[26:31] again uh thank you musician for your
[26:34] time
[26:35] and your dedication to serve the Lord
[26:41] shall we read in Psalms 91
[26:46] it's going to be a long reading
[26:51] he that dwelleth we start the first one
[26:53] until verse 12.
[26:56] he that dwelleth in the sacred place of
[26:59] the most high shall abide
[27:01] under the shadow of the Almighty
[27:05] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[27:08] and my Fortress my God in him will I
[27:12] trust
[27:13] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[27:17] Snare of the follower
[27:20] Fowler
[27:21] and from the noisome pestilence
[27:25] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[27:28] and under his wings
[27:30] shall thou Trust
[27:33] his truth shall be thy shield and
[27:35] Buckler
[27:37] Thou shalt not be afraid
[27:39] for the terror of that by night
[27:42] nor for the arrow that flyeth by day
[27:46] nor for the pestilence that worketh in
[27:49] darkness
[27:50] nor for the destruction
[27:52] that wasteth at noon
[27:56] day
[27:58] A thousand shall fall at thy side and
[28:00] ten thousand at thy right hand
[28:03] but it shall not come nigh thee
[28:06] only with thy nice shalt thou behold and
[28:11] see the reward of the wicked
[28:14] because thou has made the Lord which is
[28:19] my refuge even the most high thy
[28:21] habitation
[28:23] they shall no evil before thee neither
[28:26] shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
[28:30] for he shall give his angels charge over
[28:35] thee to keep thee in all thy ways
[28:39] they shall bear thee up in the hands
[28:43] lest thou Dash
[28:45] thy foot against a stone
[28:48] let's go in Psalm 34
[28:51] verse 7.
[28:55] just a short one
[29:00] the angel of the Lord encampeth
[29:03] around encampath around about them that
[29:06] fear Him
[29:08] and delivereth them
[29:10] may God add the blessings to the reading
[29:13] of Israel as you have your seats
[29:18] again I want to thank the pastor for
[29:20] allowing me to have this time to stand
[29:22] in the front of the purchase of the
[29:24] blood of Jesus Christ
[29:28] here we are again
[29:31] to talk about the Lord
[29:35] and when we talk about him he always
[29:37] draws an eye
[29:39] he said well two or three are gathering
[29:42] in my name
[29:44] there I am in the midst of them
[29:47] and we believe that he's here
[29:52] I felt going in different direction but
[29:54] uh
[29:55] something was kept pulling me down
[29:57] bringing me back to the same subject
[29:59] that I spoke last two services
[30:03] it's Angelic Realm and the ministry of
[30:06] angels this is going to be part three
[30:08] and it has a subtitle it's going to be
[30:10] align me with my theophany
[30:15] that's what we're here for to be aligned
[30:17] with our theophany
[30:19] to come here to
[30:23] receive instructions on how to walk
[30:25] with the Lord
[30:28] for the Amnesia spiritual nature to be
[30:30] taken away
[30:32] remember Jesus Christ when he started
[30:35] his ministry here on Earth
[30:39] after being tempted by the devil in the
[30:42] wilderness because the Bible says the
[30:43] spirit after he was filled with the Holy
[30:45] Spirit he was laid into the wilderness
[30:48] where he was tempted by the enemy
[30:51] and after the Temptation the Bible says
[30:55] the angels
[30:56] come to him to minister to him
[31:00] to restore his strength
[31:03] if him as the Lord
[31:07] the angel had to minister to him how
[31:09] much more us
[31:11] after we've been
[31:13] through the weekend
[31:15] all kind of Temptations and all kind of
[31:18] dangers and all kind of stuff that the
[31:21] enemy has put on our ways we surely need
[31:24] to be in the presence of the Lord
[31:26] to be encouraged by
[31:28] the Angels behind the pulpit
[31:30] because the prophet of God says
[31:33] when your pastor is behind the pulpit is
[31:35] an angel of the Lord for you
[31:37] we're here to be encouraged
[31:44] ministering of angels
[31:46] we didn't start today it started in the
[31:49] Old Testament
[31:51] in New Testament
[31:54] and until today with the new of the
[31:57] message of William Branham we have seen
[32:00] ministering of angels
[32:04] a human being as a human beings we are
[32:06] living in the three realms
[32:09] if I can go back to that
[32:11] we have humanistic Realm
[32:15] the realm of faith
[32:18] in the realm of visions
[32:22] the regular human being out there
[32:25] the living human
[32:27] istic realm and the goal with whatever
[32:30] the bodies or the is telling them to do
[32:34] the flesh
[32:35] it's hard I can take off my shape my
[32:38] shirt
[32:38] I can take off my top I can be topless
[32:42] but you and I cannot do such a thing
[32:44] because we have the Holy Spirit that
[32:45] will
[32:47] restrain us from doing anything
[32:53] we have the realm of faith
[32:56] that's the spiritual in the Supernatural
[32:58] Realm
[33:00] and we have also the realm of visions
[33:03] and to get to the second realm we need
[33:04] to be
[33:06] a believer
[33:09] we need to have a Holy Spirit
[33:12] and what about them says when a Believer
[33:15] receives the Holy Spirit he becomes the
[33:18] two
[33:19] being
[33:20] two-fold being I mean to say
[33:23] one here to live and to die
[33:26] and the one inside to live eternally
[33:30] and angels
[33:32] come to minister to him
[33:41] you know God sometimes uh because he
[33:43] knows us more than we do ourselves
[33:46] he knows how to talk to us
[33:50] some people he comes by at night time
[33:53] during the dream
[33:55] some people he sent an angel literally
[33:56] like this to talk to them because he
[33:59] knows us
[34:05] it's like the Prophet Elijah
[34:08] a whole Ministry have influenced it
[34:14] the two simple people one that was a
[34:17] farmer and the other one was just a
[34:19] woman
[34:20] a wider woman
[34:24] they were influenced by the ministry of
[34:27] Elijah the prophet
[34:31] this ministry kind of took them from the
[34:34] humanistic realm to the realm of
[34:39] angels
[34:41] where they start seeing things
[34:45] like Elisha
[34:50] after Elijah departed from the scene
[34:55] Elisha went through
[34:58] all kind of visitation
[35:00] of angels
[35:03] I remember one time his servant gehazi
[35:07] when the philistine
[35:10] encompassed them
[35:13] his servant was just crying and
[35:16] agitated on all kinds of ways
[35:20] because Elisha was living in that realm
[35:22] because his servant was still in the
[35:24] humanistic Realm
[35:28] but Elisha being in the Vision in the
[35:32] realm of
[35:34] angels of the realm of faith
[35:36] she was column in tranquil
[35:39] he couldn't panic
[35:43] because he was seeing something that
[35:44] gehazi would not be able to see
[35:48] when he has was looking at the
[35:51] Philistines
[35:53] but Elisha was looking at the angels
[35:58] because the Bible says the angel of the
[36:00] Lord encompassed but Abraham says they
[36:02] don't leave they are there
[36:06] and they are commissioned to take care
[36:08] of you from your birth until your death
[36:12] it's a one thing to talk about
[36:15] the angels
[36:17] to preach about this ministering of
[36:19] angels but it's another thing to
[36:21] experience that
[36:24] I remember one day I was in uh Tempe I
[36:26] was driving and
[36:28] was trying to make a turn but end up
[36:30] going to the gas station QT
[36:33] as I was pulling in I hate birdly my uh
[36:36] one of my uh Tire I thought maybe I
[36:40] damaged the rims
[36:41] as I pulled over and then parked
[36:44] I was talking to myself I was like let
[36:46] me check is it the room okay no the room
[36:48] was okay but I looked I heard some F I
[36:51] was like oh
[36:52] my tire is going flat
[36:55] and I was talking to myself I said okay
[36:57] I have everything I'll take care of that
[37:01] is I open the trunk
[37:03] boom open and see the spare tire was
[37:05] there
[37:07] and I didn't have my Jack I didn't have
[37:09] any range
[37:11] because I took them put them in my main
[37:13] event because I've been traveling back
[37:15] and forth going to see my niece in New
[37:16] Mexico
[37:18] I was like okay Freddie what are you
[37:20] gonna do now
[37:23] I looked to my right side that was a
[37:25] small car Mazda 3. I believe it was if
[37:28] I'm not mistaken
[37:30] with dust
[37:32] covering that car and I look inside
[37:35] was a man sitting there
[37:38] bearded and
[37:40] I looked at him I was like
[37:43] should I start with him or start
[37:44] question some other people if they have
[37:46] a Jack to help me
[37:49] as soon as I got there
[37:52] sir would you yeah yeah yes I didn't
[37:54] even finish my sentence
[37:57] and went to the back of his trunk and
[38:00] he has a Jack he never uses that he
[38:02] didn't even know how to pull it out
[38:06] I helped him and I took it and
[38:08] he came over helped me on
[38:11] all kind of with all kind of things and
[38:13] grabbing a bolted
[38:16] I was like wow
[38:18] and after that I was like you talked
[38:20] about it something was telling me
[38:23] amen
[38:24] you talked about angels
[38:27] he didn't question he didn't he was he
[38:30] seems like was ready
[38:32] and my mind went back in the Bible
[38:35] to where Abraham
[38:37] took Isaac
[38:39] to sacrifice
[38:42] and when God saw his obedience he said
[38:44] no stop
[38:46] he looked to his side that was a lamb
[38:50] that was exactly what happened to me and
[38:52] Lucas said it was the guy was like did
[38:53] he come from heaven or something
[38:56] because he was looking at me it was
[38:58] ready to help
[39:00] so we need to be aware of angels
[39:05] they are there to take care of us in
[39:07] many ways
[39:08] they give us strength
[39:10] they encourage us when we're going
[39:13] through hard times
[39:15] remember Joshua when he was going
[39:17] through her time when Moses left the
[39:19] Saint the scene
[39:20] the angel of the Lord came up to him to
[39:23] encourage him
[39:24] view of good courage
[39:26] you're the one to take these people in
[39:28] the Promised Land
[39:30] because you know the devil is there
[39:32] first to jump on the occasion to start
[39:34] discouraging people yes
[39:37] and the Lord came to encourage Joshua
[39:42] they are there to deliver us
[39:45] whenever we have a hard time we are we
[39:48] don't know which way to go
[39:50] the children of Israel the Hebrews the
[39:52] three Hebrews
[39:54] children
[39:55] ago
[39:59] they were there they took decision to
[40:02] not serve
[40:04] the god of Babylon they say no we're not
[40:06] going to bow
[40:07] regardless of the conditional we're
[40:09] going to put you in the fight send us in
[40:11] the fire
[40:14] the angel the Fourth Man Came Down
[40:18] to deliver them
[40:20] the children of Israel they were like
[40:23] going into the Promised Land
[40:26] they've been Guided by the angel
[40:29] the almighty God himself in the pillow
[40:31] fire guiding them
[40:35] when Pharaoh's Army was approaching
[40:38] coming try to destroy them
[40:42] that angel stood between Pharaoh's Army
[40:46] and Israel
[40:48] in front of them he was guiding them
[40:50] behind them protected them and it was a
[40:53] provider in the midst
[40:56] I believe that's the case with us also
[40:59] as we're going through this journey
[41:07] the angel protects they protect us
[41:09] they guide us
[41:11] they give us strategies how to fight
[41:13] where to fight
[41:17] and when to fight
[41:20] they walk with us
[41:23] every day
[41:25] because in the
[41:33] in the message influence
[41:35] preached in 1963
[41:41] March I think I believe was March the
[41:43] 8th
[41:44] he said this
[41:46] you see we've got to be conscious of
[41:49] God's presence
[41:52] this little five senses that we are
[41:54] living in
[41:55] that's just a little world of our own
[41:58] see
[41:59] but God
[42:01] that we was only given these so we could
[42:05] contact our Earthly home
[42:08] but there are senses beyond that
[42:10] another dimension
[42:12] and God is always present
[42:15] if we could only remember that the
[42:17] angels of the Lord are encamped about
[42:20] those who fear Him
[42:23] in this building tonight stands Jesus
[42:25] Christ
[42:29] in this building tonight is hosts of
[42:32] angels thousands of them
[42:35] gathered around
[42:37] you don't see them but you can feel the
[42:39] influence of them
[42:43] telling you that they are here
[42:47] if that isn't the if that isn't so
[42:49] endangered scriptures isn't so
[42:52] and if the scriptures isn't right then
[42:55] God isn't right
[42:57] the Bible says that the angels of God
[43:00] are encamped
[43:03] they don't leave they stay
[43:05] near those that fear Him
[43:09] Jesus said wherever two or three are
[43:11] gathering in my name I'll be in the
[43:15] midst
[43:17] then that makes him in
[43:20] a world that we cannot see
[43:23] that's our five senses
[43:25] doesn't contact
[43:27] Jesus Christ is here present if we could
[43:30] be conscious of that
[43:33] and remember
[43:35] this is what I want to say remember not
[43:38] only here but when you are walking down
[43:41] the street
[43:42] whatever you are
[43:44] you that profess to be Believers and
[43:47] feel the Lord
[43:50] remember the angels of God are moving
[43:52] with you
[43:54] sorry
[43:56] they watch everything you do
[43:59] every thought that goes through your
[44:01] mind
[44:02] and they know all about you
[44:06] therefore we must be conscious of that
[44:09] if we are not conscious of it
[44:11] then you act
[44:13] in any way
[44:16] so people mostly today
[44:18] too many people are not conscious of the
[44:20] presence of the Lord Jesus
[44:23] that's the reason they have these things
[44:26] we have going on now this that's not
[44:30] right
[44:31] if you could only do like David said
[44:35] I put the lord always before me
[44:39] oh I like that
[44:41] the lord always before me
[44:44] where he goes I'll follow
[44:47] and I'm conscious
[44:48] that everywhere I'm going
[44:51] in other words in other words David said
[44:53] that the Lord is going before me
[44:57] I will not leave thee nor forsake thee
[45:00] say Jesus lo I am with you
[45:04] always
[45:05] even to the end of the world he cannot
[45:08] leave us
[45:09] he promised it not to
[45:13] see we're not conscious
[45:17] of the presence of God and the angels
[45:19] one guy questioned me one day
[45:22] are you Christians I say I am Christian
[45:26] how do you keep your faith
[45:28] how do you stay you know not
[45:32] going to and fro and you know today you
[45:34] are Christian and tomorrow you are
[45:36] you're falling I said
[45:38] like what about him says here I keep
[45:41] Jesus I keep the Lord I put him in front
[45:43] of me all the time
[45:46] and I told him
[45:49] this is what I might tell the young
[45:51] people those those that need to be
[45:53] baptized
[45:56] you know when Jesus before he died and
[45:58] he rose again
[46:00] everybody could see him
[46:01] Believers and non-believers
[46:04] but after his death and his
[46:06] resurrections he was only appearing to
[46:09] the Believers
[46:11] if you truly have died with Christ and
[46:14] have resurrected with him
[46:16] you should only appear to the Believers
[46:21] that's one thing to keep your faith
[46:25] you need to change your environment
[46:29] I don't want to go ahead of myself
[46:36] because when you're not conscious of the
[46:38] presence of God you will act in all
[46:40] kinds of ways
[46:42] but if you are conscious of his presence
[46:45] you will act accordingly
[47:01] the message we believe in from
[47:05] the birth of the prophet of this end
[47:07] time
[47:09] until he's living off of the scene
[47:12] was full of visitation of angels
[47:16] from his birth in 1909 April the 6th
[47:20] the Angels Came
[47:24] into the little old cabin like he said
[47:30] and when he was seven years old
[47:34] he made Angels when he was going to pack
[47:36] water
[47:39] an angel talked to him
[47:43] do not smoke do not drink
[47:46] or do any
[47:48] defy or any you know
[47:51] don't Define your body because I would
[47:53] have work to do with you
[47:55] the same is he appeared to Mary
[48:00] when he got older
[48:01] the medium told him that he was born
[48:04] under the sign
[48:07] there was a constellation of stars
[48:11] when he was born and he she said
[48:13] whenever they
[48:15] lined up like that there's something
[48:17] some big event to take place on the
[48:20] Earth
[48:22] exactly like when Jesus was born
[48:25] three stars lined up
[48:29] there was a constellation of the Stars
[48:33] and they appeared to the uh Shepherd the
[48:36] major eyes
[48:39] laid them
[48:41] guiding them to where the king was born
[48:46] when the Bible says a certain point that
[48:48] those Stars disappeared
[48:51] in the Shepherds
[48:53] they kind of got lost in the end up
[48:55] being in erode
[48:57] area
[48:59] the mingle of the politicians and the
[49:00] wasted the time over there
[49:02] I wonder
[49:04] that's the same condition that is that
[49:07] most Ministers of the message today
[49:11] they are in
[49:13] sometimes they get lost they can track
[49:16] the the Stars
[49:19] they can follow the prophet they came
[49:22] keep tracking the the Stars they get
[49:24] mingled into the politics and things of
[49:26] the world
[49:27] no wonder we see the world in the church
[49:34] because they are lost and I don't know
[49:36] how long they're going to be lost in
[49:37] being mingled of the things of the world
[49:40] they need to go back to the star and
[49:43] follow it
[49:47] because this star which is the prophet
[49:49] William Branham
[49:51] he didn't come here to speak all of his
[49:53] of his ministry of himself but he came
[49:56] here to take us to the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:01] because his ministry had to be exactly
[50:04] reflecting the ministry of Jesus Christ
[50:07] so when those Stars
[50:10] got into constellation which means there
[50:13] was a Ministry to be born
[50:17] the ministry that has to reflect exactly
[50:19] the meaning of Jesus Christ
[50:22] no wonder people get confused and
[50:25] start taking him as Jesus Christ himself
[50:30] because he was aware
[50:32] of his ministry or and of the presence
[50:34] of the Lord he told them I'm Not Jesus
[50:37] Christ
[50:43] the Lord Jesus Christ here on Earth he
[50:45] said
[50:47] when the Holy Spirit Will Come
[50:50] he will take he will teach you all
[50:52] things
[50:54] he will bring to your remembrance
[50:56] everything that I've preached or taught
[50:59] you
[51:00] even more
[51:03] if you see William Branham his ministry
[51:05] if you read it of close attention
[51:09] you will see it's exactly the minutes of
[51:11] Jesus Christ
[51:15] whether you take the uh
[51:18] teaching on demons
[51:21] he taught us about demonology
[51:24] he even went down into
[51:27] the details
[51:30] Jesus Christ preached about the
[51:34] Dimensions when he spoke about the uh
[51:37] Young Rich ruler
[51:40] but the prophet in this end time went
[51:43] into the details
[51:48] you can go on and on and on and on it's
[51:50] exactly the ministry of Jesus Christ no
[51:52] wonder they consider him as Jesus
[51:55] because when remember when the Capstone
[51:57] had to come to cup off the pyramid
[52:01] the part that has to meet with the
[52:03] Capstone has exact has to be exact has
[52:06] to fit in
[52:08] it doesn't have to be bigger or smaller
[52:11] he has to has to be exact the he has to
[52:14] fit
[52:30] with this in mind
[52:36] if you see every single time the angel
[52:38] appears whether it's in the old or the
[52:41] New Testament especially to the women
[52:44] it's linked to the birth of a child
[52:50] let's read in uh the Book of Judges
[53:04] there's so many things to go through
[53:06] here
[53:07] for many informations
[53:09] let's read Judges chapter 13.
[53:17] from verse 1 to verse 6 we can go all
[53:20] done but let's read until verse 6.
[53:29] and the children of Israel let's start
[53:31] with so let's start with verse two not
[53:33] one
[53:36] and there was a certain main of Zora of
[53:39] the family of the danits
[53:42] whose name was Manoa
[53:45] and his wife was barren
[53:47] and bear not
[53:50] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[53:52] the woman and said unto her behold now
[53:55] Thou Art barren
[53:58] embarrassed not
[54:00] but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son
[54:03] now therefore be aware
[54:06] pray thee and drink not wine no strong
[54:10] strong drink
[54:12] or eat not any unclean thing
[54:15] for Lo thou shall conceive and bear a
[54:18] son
[54:19] a known razor shall come on his head
[54:23] for the child shall be Nazarite
[54:26] unto God from the womb
[54:30] and he shall begin to
[54:33] deliver Israel out of the hands of the
[54:36] philistine
[54:38] then the woman came and told her husband
[54:41] saying a man of God came unto me
[54:45] and his countenance was like a continent
[54:48] the continents of an angel of God
[54:51] very terrible
[54:53] but ask him not once he was neither told
[54:58] he me his name
[55:04] we're in the Bible here
[55:12] this child that was to be born has to
[55:15] deliver Israel when he got older
[55:19] but when the angel appeared to the woman
[55:25] he gave her the instruction or the exact
[55:28] diet
[55:30] for this child to be born in Nice
[55:33] condition
[55:38] because this child
[55:40] was to be Nazarite from the womb of his
[55:43] mom
[55:46] and this child was the one to deliver
[55:48] Israel
[55:54] in the New Testament
[55:57] the angel appeared to Elizabeth
[56:00] announcing the birth of
[56:03] John the Baptist
[56:06] exactly the same diet here
[56:09] when the angel appeared to William
[56:10] Branham was exactly the right the same
[56:12] diet
[56:17] guess what in this end time
[56:19] not only we have received the seventh
[56:21] angel
[56:22] but it was another Mighty angel that has
[56:24] come down
[56:28] and through the ministry of ulambranum
[56:31] this Angel gave us the diet of how to
[56:34] behave in order to
[56:37] birth Jesus Christ in the mange of our
[56:40] heart
[56:49] because the same Jesus that would be
[56:51] born in our hearts is the same one that
[56:54] will Deliver Us from
[56:56] all
[56:58] things
[57:01] starting with our own being because the
[57:04] first enemy that William Branham has is
[57:06] William Branham
[57:10] so this Angel has come down with exact
[57:12] information he didn't come with a simple
[57:14] message
[57:15] but he came down
[57:17] with an open book
[57:20] not a closer book because remember one
[57:23] time in the Bible
[57:24] there was a minister to whom Jesus
[57:27] handed a closet book
[57:30] after he read it in the temple remember
[57:32] that
[57:33] but in this end time we have received
[57:35] the angel the mighty angel of open book
[57:38] he handed it to Earthly angel
[57:44] and this is The Book of Life
[57:50] and this book
[57:52] will tell you where you came from
[57:54] where you going
[57:56] Who You Are
[57:58] how to overcome
[58:00] how to behave
[58:03] we can track the trip of this book
[58:08] this is the title deed that gives you
[58:11] the power
[58:12] to have dominion on the Earth
[58:17] and it's for a human being which we are
[58:20] this book was in the hands of God
[58:24] after he gave it to Adam because the
[58:26] book for is for the man
[58:29] he gave it to Adam a certain point in
[58:31] the beginning in God of Eden
[58:33] and for some reason the devil got that
[58:36] book and says he's
[58:39] dirty hand could not keep that book went
[58:42] back in the hands of God
[58:46] until in this end time
[58:49] where the mighty Angel has descended
[58:51] with this open book
[58:55] so from the hands of God
[58:57] to the human being
[58:59] the devil tried to take it God got it
[59:01] back
[59:04] and when there was no man to claim or to
[59:07] take that book in the hands of the Lamb
[59:09] remember John cried
[59:12] because there's nobody worthy to touch
[59:14] even to look at the book
[59:18] John cried
[59:20] why did he cry because when he was here
[59:22] on the Earth
[59:24] Jesus told them don't be happy don't
[59:26] Rejoice because of the Demons were
[59:28] subject unto you
[59:31] but be happy because your names are
[59:34] written in the book
[59:36] of life
[59:38] because if there was nobody to claim you
[59:40] to take that book the whole Humanity
[59:42] will have been lost
[59:48] now this book
[59:50] opened
[59:51] was handed to the prophet of this end
[59:53] time
[59:56] he didn't keep well eat with him
[1:00:04] from God
[1:00:05] to him human being to Adam he went back
[1:00:08] to God
[1:00:09] and came down
[1:00:11] the a mighty Angel took it which is
[1:00:13] Jesus Christ the lamb
[1:00:16] and he's bringing it down to hand it
[1:00:18] back to the human being
[1:00:22] so the final destination of this book
[1:00:24] has to be in US
[1:00:28] and this book
[1:00:31] it's Jesus Christ himself
[1:00:36] we have received exactly the angel in
[1:00:39] the same way
[1:00:40] manoa's wife received angel
[1:00:42] Mary received the angel
[1:00:44] Sarah in Old Testament received angel
[1:00:48] and all those visitations was linked to
[1:00:50] the birth of a special child
[1:00:53] and this angel coming down here
[1:00:56] is for the birth of the special child
[1:00:58] which is Jesus Christ in the mange of
[1:01:00] your heart
[1:01:05] all the instructions has been given to
[1:01:07] us of how to behave
[1:01:09] the special diet
[1:01:14] because we are in
[1:01:16] a heavenly vision
[1:01:19] remember in uh
[1:01:21] John 5 when Jesus went to uh
[1:01:27] went to the the pool of Bethesda
[1:01:32] the Bible says at a certain point
[1:01:34] all people of all kind of uh health
[1:01:37] conditions gathered around the pool
[1:01:40] the Bible says at a certain point an
[1:01:42] angel would be saying in Troubled Water
[1:01:43] whoever will jump your need first will
[1:01:46] get healed
[1:01:49] at a certain moment an angel will come
[1:01:51] down
[1:01:52] trouble the world
[1:01:54] whoever jumped in the water remember the
[1:01:56] water talks about the word
[1:01:59] so we had an angel
[1:02:02] First Age second age until
[1:02:06] the seventh one
[1:02:08] so this time when everybody was
[1:02:10] expecting a name for an angel to come in
[1:02:12] trouble the water they saw Jesus coming
[1:02:17] I was the mighty angel
[1:02:20] when he came he was skipping people
[1:02:23] he didn't mean to
[1:02:26] skip them because he was coming with a
[1:02:28] vision
[1:02:28] because he said the son doesn't do
[1:02:31] anything unless the father shows him
[1:02:33] what to do
[1:02:36] so he had the vision heavenly vision
[1:02:39] he was skipping people even though they
[1:02:41] had condition that need his attention
[1:02:43] but he was skipping them
[1:02:45] speak skipping that one go to Jonathan
[1:02:48] skipping this one go to Barron
[1:02:54] and in this end time
[1:02:57] the same Angel has come down
[1:03:00] not everybody have received a message
[1:03:03] they have conditions that need his
[1:03:05] attention
[1:03:06] but he was keeping them and coming to
[1:03:07] you and I
[1:03:14] so the very son which is Jesus Christ
[1:03:17] that we need to conceive
[1:03:20] like I said they need a special
[1:03:22] attention
[1:03:23] special diet
[1:03:26] that's what I'm says let me see in your
[1:03:28] room in your office
[1:03:30] what do you have as a magazine as a
[1:03:32] newspaper
[1:03:34] what is hanging on your wall
[1:03:37] who are you mingling with
[1:03:40] those are the diet
[1:03:43] because the the world we are living in
[1:03:46] especially in this end time there's too
[1:03:48] many things happening
[1:03:50] the end time message is feeding the end
[1:03:53] time conditions
[1:03:56] I met one guy who was telling me about
[1:03:58] his daughter
[1:04:02] he told me first about his health
[1:04:04] condition he said the doctor gave him
[1:04:06] few days to leave you on the Earth
[1:04:09] and he preferred to be with his mom he
[1:04:11] brought his little child she's UH 60 she
[1:04:13] was uh she's six years old
[1:04:16] he told me something shocked him because
[1:04:18] one day his daughter coming from school
[1:04:20] she was telling him dad you know I don't
[1:04:21] even know which gender I am
[1:04:24] and he said shut your mouth
[1:04:27] I cut you umbilical cord
[1:04:30] I know exactly what gender you are
[1:04:35] so with all of these conditions
[1:04:38] with all these pressures
[1:04:42] naked women and all of this it's not for
[1:04:45] people on in the world it's for us
[1:04:49] so if you don't have
[1:04:51] Jesus Christ in your heart
[1:04:55] the son that will deliver you
[1:05:00] from all the Temptation from all the
[1:05:02] conditions you're gonna fall
[1:05:12] Manoa wanted to see the angel too
[1:05:16] if you go read the whole
[1:05:18] chapter you will see that
[1:05:22] and when I was uh searching and reading
[1:05:25] and listening to Barbara messages and
[1:05:32] but a billboard wanted to see the angel
[1:05:34] too
[1:05:38] but I'm talked about the Angels so much
[1:05:40] that he wanted to see the angel I was
[1:05:42] like this is the Bible
[1:05:44] because Manoa the angel appeared to his
[1:05:46] wife
[1:05:47] and he went to ask the Lord can you send
[1:05:49] back that angel that man again to teach
[1:05:52] us how to
[1:05:53] take care of this child
[1:05:56] and God heard his prayer
[1:05:58] same did God hear the prayer of uh Billy
[1:06:02] Paul
[1:06:03] and he was uh you can go on YouTube and
[1:06:05] you see how he's uh giving is that
[1:06:07] testimony I was like wow we are in the
[1:06:10] Bible
[1:06:16] God answered his prayer
[1:06:21] so
[1:06:26] taking this book in our heart
[1:06:29] reading this book
[1:06:31] going through it
[1:06:33] it gives us
[1:06:34] because this is the title deed as I said
[1:06:37] earlier
[1:06:38] so title that is that is giving us the
[1:06:41] power to have dominion on the Earth
[1:06:47] and this will allow us to be aligned
[1:06:51] with our theophany
[1:06:53] remember brother Barnum was
[1:06:55] what he was doing he was just aligning
[1:06:57] himself with his theophany
[1:07:02] because one day he had conversation with
[1:07:04] his wife
[1:07:06] she said honey you are going bald headed
[1:07:08] you say no I haven't lost my hair
[1:07:12] and say no
[1:07:13] tell me where they are because you don't
[1:07:15] have anything no you tell me where the
[1:07:17] word before I got them and I'll tell you
[1:07:19] well they are waiting for me
[1:07:23] which means he was aligning himself with
[1:07:25] his theophany
[1:07:29] two or three years after that
[1:07:32] he has he had a vision
[1:07:37] he himself had a hard time to
[1:07:40] consider it as a vision was it a real
[1:07:42] life or what was it
[1:07:47] in things that are to be
[1:07:50] but the bottom says this
[1:07:53] but that morning when I felt something
[1:07:56] come over me
[1:07:58] and I thought usually like a vision
[1:08:00] comes and I looked and I looked and I
[1:08:04] thought my
[1:08:05] what is this
[1:08:07] and I looked at Great green
[1:08:11] Hills
[1:08:12] and young woman
[1:08:14] just coming from everywhere
[1:08:16] by the tens of thousands and hundreds of
[1:08:19] thousands
[1:08:21] and they were all coming long hair
[1:08:24] hanging down their back
[1:08:27] white robes on
[1:08:29] barefooted
[1:08:31] you that are arguing about dressing
[1:08:37] because this was in heaven
[1:08:40] don't argue so if you want to go to
[1:08:42] heaven
[1:08:44] see how to address
[1:08:47] long robe
[1:08:51] barefooted
[1:08:52] no I don't want you to be
[1:08:54] working barefooted
[1:08:59] in the world coming long hair hanging
[1:09:02] down their back white robes on
[1:09:04] barefooted screaming hollering
[1:09:07] our brother
[1:09:10] I thought now this is strange
[1:09:13] and I turned back around and I looked
[1:09:16] and there I laid right there
[1:09:20] and there was my wife laying there
[1:09:24] on the bed
[1:09:26] and I said now you know what I died
[1:09:29] I say that's what happened
[1:09:32] I've died
[1:09:33] and I said I might have had a heart
[1:09:36] attack or something
[1:09:38] I've died
[1:09:40] there lays my body
[1:09:44] I was just laying there with my hands
[1:09:47] back like that
[1:09:50] just as stiff I thought well that's not
[1:09:53] 20 feet from me
[1:09:58] see
[1:09:59] you have two men here
[1:10:03] you have a man born of a woman
[1:10:05] in a man one of a man
[1:10:12] let's continue
[1:10:16] and there I was looking I thought there
[1:10:19] is my wife there is everything
[1:10:22] there was my shirt hanging there on that
[1:10:24] bed post
[1:10:26] and I thought here here I am
[1:10:29] I looked around again and these women
[1:10:32] were all coming
[1:10:34] and they were and I looked coming this
[1:10:37] way
[1:10:38] and they come my brothers all genuine
[1:10:41] all of them look to be young man
[1:10:45] they were screaming
[1:10:47] our precious brother
[1:10:49] why I didn't know what to think
[1:10:53] I thought this this is strange
[1:10:56] I looked back
[1:10:58] and I was an old man
[1:11:00] I was young
[1:11:03] and I thought this is strange thing
[1:11:06] I thought is is this a vision
[1:11:10] I'd bite my finger
[1:11:12] I thought no
[1:11:14] I ain't that kind of vision I've had
[1:11:18] and then there's something begin to talk
[1:11:21] to me
[1:11:25] up and said you've entered
[1:11:28] in your people
[1:11:31] and I thought with with my people are
[1:11:35] all these brenhams and he said they are
[1:11:37] your comfort to Christ
[1:11:41] and these women
[1:11:43] and you know I've always been considered
[1:11:45] kind of they call me women hater
[1:11:48] you see
[1:11:50] the prophet all his life he was
[1:11:53] aligning himself
[1:11:56] or tuning himself with his theophany
[1:12:01] until to these days and he said he could
[1:12:03] look back there
[1:12:05] and see himself just laying back with
[1:12:07] hands like this
[1:12:09] this man born of a woman
[1:12:11] didn't have any clue of what was going
[1:12:13] on
[1:12:14] but the main one of a man was young
[1:12:18] he could see the other side
[1:12:21] he could see this side of curtain of
[1:12:23] time
[1:12:26] which means this body is nothing
[1:12:30] didn't have any clue just laying back
[1:12:33] there
[1:12:34] old
[1:12:35] head bold
[1:12:37] full of fear
[1:12:40] but this one was young strong
[1:12:46] that's why we're here to be taught
[1:12:52] to receive instructions of how to take
[1:12:54] off the spiritual amnesia
[1:12:57] the more we talk about the Lord the more
[1:12:59] we read the message
[1:13:00] the spiritual nature is going away
[1:13:03] we are tuning
[1:13:05] lining up with our theophany
[1:13:08] because that's what we're heading
[1:13:12] we don't want to keep talking Earthly we
[1:13:14] need to talk heavenly
[1:13:21] and to get to that
[1:13:23] it takes God himself to be with us
[1:13:27] and he told us lo I will be with you
[1:13:29] even in you until the end of the time
[1:13:37] he gave
[1:13:39] instructions to the angels to take care
[1:13:41] of us from birth until death not only
[1:13:44] that but he himself is an angel creator
[1:13:46] because remember those angels creation
[1:13:48] an angel Creator himself
[1:13:52] he said Lord I'll be with you even in
[1:13:55] you until the end of the time
[1:14:00] what a consolation
[1:14:02] not only to be with us but
[1:14:05] the most sacred part of a human being is
[1:14:07] a heart is a soul that's where he is
[1:14:10] dwelling
[1:14:14] but now he he gave charge to Angel to
[1:14:19] protect you
[1:14:23] do not really protect this body but
[1:14:24] they're protecting God that is in you
[1:14:26] the Throne of your heart
[1:14:29] because we have three Thrones the first
[1:14:31] Throne was Heaven the second one in
[1:14:33] Jesus Christ like Barbara says and the
[1:14:36] third one is a human being
[1:14:37] believers
[1:14:40] if there's no God in your heart
[1:14:42] they can come
[1:14:44] what are they protecting
[1:14:46] unbelief no
[1:14:49] because when God does in your heart
[1:14:52] you believe
[1:14:54] because the Bible says without faith you
[1:14:57] cannot even please God
[1:15:01] you're unbelievable
[1:15:03] send the Angels away but your faith will
[1:15:06] draw them close to you
[1:15:15] with this book open we know who we are
[1:15:17] where we come from and where we're going
[1:15:20] and I remember one time in the Bible God
[1:15:22] was questioning job
[1:15:27] he questioned him
[1:15:30] because something was going through his
[1:15:31] life he was afraid of his children he
[1:15:33] was giving offering and praying and
[1:15:36] because maybe they have they might have
[1:15:38] done something I need to pray for them I
[1:15:39] need to consecrate or to you know bring
[1:15:42] them into the the Lord presence through
[1:15:44] the prayers and sacrifices and things
[1:15:45] the very thing he was afraid of happened
[1:15:48] to him
[1:15:50] be careful the very thing you're afraid
[1:15:51] of might happen to you therefore cast
[1:15:55] The Fear away
[1:15:59] and he started cursing the days of his
[1:16:01] birth and things
[1:16:04] and God came down he's like who's this
[1:16:06] man that is
[1:16:08] darkening the counsel of God by words
[1:16:11] without knowledge
[1:16:15] and I'm gonna ask you questions
[1:16:18] where were you when I was laying the
[1:16:20] foundation of this world
[1:16:22] brothers and sisters today we have the
[1:16:24] answer
[1:16:25] we cannot be speechless like uh job
[1:16:29] because the book is open
[1:16:32] because we have the book with us we know
[1:16:34] where we come from we know we know where
[1:16:36] we're going and we know why we are here
[1:16:38] on this Earth
[1:16:39] we can be speechless
[1:16:42] we can tell him we're in your mind
[1:16:48] too many questions he said can you bind
[1:16:52] the sweet influence of the Pleiades
[1:16:57] and the plead is you know there are
[1:16:58] seven stars and because it's Seven
[1:17:00] Sisters
[1:17:05] feel that
[1:17:06] sweet influence when you listen to the
[1:17:08] message
[1:17:11] all right
[1:17:13] the same influence that cleopas and his
[1:17:16] friend
[1:17:17] was under they felt the heart was
[1:17:20] burning when Jesus was talking to them
[1:17:23] when you come to church when you read
[1:17:24] the Bible when you read the message you
[1:17:25] need to feel the same influence
[1:17:31] even Jesus Christ when he was preaching
[1:17:32] here on the Earth
[1:17:34] in the temple
[1:17:36] the Jews that was like questioning
[1:17:37] themselves whose kind of man is this
[1:17:40] he's commelling the demons and they are
[1:17:43] living
[1:17:47] sometimes God can provoke the devil
[1:17:50] because he's trusting you
[1:17:52] that's why he was questioning job
[1:17:56] what kind of man is this darkening the
[1:17:58] counsel of God
[1:18:00] sometimes God can trust you so much that
[1:18:02] he can provoke the devil have you seen
[1:18:04] my servant devil job
[1:18:09] so sometimes you need to be careful you
[1:18:11] see a situation going you're going
[1:18:13] through a situation don't have to Panic
[1:18:15] or just behave in misbehaving in all
[1:18:18] kinds of ways be careful
[1:18:20] might be your father
[1:18:22] who's provoking the devil because he's
[1:18:24] trusting you more
[1:18:27] you know one day he was
[1:18:29] preached by Adam
[1:18:34] God was preached well I mean Adam was
[1:18:36] preaching God
[1:18:37] remember in the Bible in the in Genesis
[1:18:42] she brought all the creatures in front
[1:18:45] of Adam see how he's going to name them
[1:18:48] this is a lion
[1:18:49] God was saying amen
[1:18:53] this is an ego amen
[1:18:56] because he knew Adam has the revelation
[1:18:59] of what was the name of that creature
[1:19:03] until he brought his wife to him
[1:19:06] now this is the bone of my bones
[1:19:10] who told him he had the Revelation and
[1:19:12] God was saying Amen to the preaching of
[1:19:14] Adam
[1:19:16] I remember one brother was telling me
[1:19:18] sometimes he was going he was married
[1:19:20] back then he was uh telling me because I
[1:19:22] wasn't married back then when I was in
[1:19:24] the Congo
[1:19:26] um he was like my wife she's giving me
[1:19:28] her time I wonder is is this the my uh
[1:19:31] rib or this is a chicken bones or
[1:19:33] because she's giving me her time
[1:19:38] maybe it's a chicken bone that cannot
[1:19:40] fit here
[1:19:53] so this book
[1:19:55] has everything we have need of
[1:20:00] for this journey we are going
[1:20:04] we have the special diet for Christ
[1:20:09] that we need to observe because the
[1:20:13] angel like uh Manoa and his wife they
[1:20:16] needed the angel to tell them how to
[1:20:18] what kind of diet and how to behave how
[1:20:20] to take care of this child
[1:20:23] the seventh messenger
[1:20:26] the seventh angel has given us the diet
[1:20:31] it's unto us
[1:20:34] to go through this diet and see what we
[1:20:37] need to do
[1:20:40] because he has to be born in the mange
[1:20:42] of our heart
[1:20:43] he's the very one to deliver us
[1:20:57] coming back to uh
[1:21:00] lithiumphony
[1:21:04] in the Old Testament they used to call
[1:21:06] the angel
[1:21:08] until when we got William Branham
[1:21:11] is a messenger
[1:21:13] he explained to us what it was they back
[1:21:15] then they called it angel
[1:21:19] even Jesus Christ himself in Matthew 18
[1:21:22] 10.
[1:21:27] yes we did
[1:21:43] in Matthew 18 chapter 18 verse 10 he
[1:21:46] says
[1:21:47] take heed that you despise not one of
[1:21:51] these little ones
[1:21:52] for I say unto you that in heaven the
[1:21:57] angels
[1:21:59] do always behold the father I mean the
[1:22:02] face of my father
[1:22:03] which is in heaven
[1:22:06] taught us this is our theophany
[1:22:11] he said you can feel the influence of
[1:22:13] them
[1:22:14] that's why you have the sweet feel the
[1:22:16] sweet influence
[1:22:19] he said they are bumping into you
[1:22:25] theophany
[1:22:35] how can we
[1:22:40] line up without theophany if we don't
[1:22:43] receive Christ in our heart
[1:22:49] so these teachings now nowadays you see
[1:22:53] many message
[1:22:54] churches they don't go through them
[1:22:58] as I say is that like the ministers they
[1:23:00] are maybe lost in the politics and
[1:23:03] things of this world
[1:23:05] because this message that has come to us
[1:23:07] is a Urgent Message
[1:23:09] is to take us home
[1:23:12] these are the things we need to insist
[1:23:18] because there's a philosopher who said
[1:23:21] the man does it mean humankind
[1:23:26] does evil things because he doesn't know
[1:23:29] good things
[1:23:31] because if he knows good things he will
[1:23:34] necessarily do them
[1:23:36] that's why we are
[1:23:38] repeating
[1:23:41] bringing to your remembrance
[1:23:44] these teachings of theophanese
[1:23:48] of heavenly homes
[1:23:52] trying to project the very picture of
[1:23:55] you the Divine picture
[1:23:57] of yourself
[1:24:00] by the preacher of the word
[1:24:07] and when a human especially the
[1:24:09] Believers will necessarily know
[1:24:11] who they are
[1:24:13] while they are here where they are going
[1:24:17] they will surely
[1:24:21] act accordingly
[1:24:29] I like the way you are aiming
[1:24:33] if it's not English you are amen amen
[1:24:37] I remember the other day what Iran
[1:24:39] mentioned something about sister Vicky I
[1:24:41] don't know we've seen the Vicky here
[1:24:48] you are true Nightingale a nightingale
[1:24:51] and we have a lot of Nightingales here
[1:24:53] don't get me wrong
[1:24:56] you know what it is right what about
[1:24:57] them talked about Nightingales
[1:25:00] and he said he made a studies on The
[1:25:03] Nightingales
[1:25:04] he said they are during the night time
[1:25:07] when the star is shining they'll just
[1:25:09] stick their head up
[1:25:11] and uh the other detail is that they are
[1:25:13] zeroing in
[1:25:15] to look at the star that's how they are
[1:25:19] singing
[1:25:20] which means god is somewhere
[1:25:23] so if you are sleeping you cannot say
[1:25:26] Amen
[1:25:29] because you need to zero in on the star
[1:25:31] that is shining
[1:25:37] all right let's turn to our feet
[1:25:43] show about our heads at the same time
[1:25:48] father
[1:25:51] even though we spoke in
[1:25:55] picking wood here and there and
[1:25:58] but I know you have said something that
[1:26:00] will be an encouragement for your
[1:26:01] children tonight
[1:26:04] I believe the holy spirit will take and
[1:26:08] repeat and cause them to be pondering on
[1:26:12] these words and to even
[1:26:14] dive and go deep
[1:26:16] into the world
[1:26:18] to be blessed again
[1:26:25] this world is passing away
[1:26:30] we have received a message that is
[1:26:32] telling us where we come from and where
[1:26:34] we're going
[1:26:35] and how to be prepared for the rapture
[1:26:40] father help us the battle is
[1:26:48] heavy
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:51] we see all kind of things taking place
[1:26:52] in this end time
[1:26:54] but as your Prophet said the end time
[1:26:57] condition
[1:26:59] has
[1:27:01] a message that will fit
[1:27:05] we cannot face these battles
[1:27:09] without you
[1:27:11] that's why we are inviting you God to
[1:27:13] come in our lives and to give us an
[1:27:15] encouragement
[1:27:17] to cause us to be pondering and
[1:27:19] meditating on these words of father
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:24] I commit each and every one of us
[1:27:26] tonight in your hands
[1:27:28] as we'll be departing from this place
[1:27:30] but not from your presence
[1:27:33] expecting you to bring us back again
[1:27:39] to be taught by you
[1:27:42] to be given instructions of how to
[1:27:44] behave in this wicked world
[1:27:48] bless each and every one of us
[1:27:51] as we commit the rest of the surface in
[1:27:53] your hands in Jesus name we pray amen
