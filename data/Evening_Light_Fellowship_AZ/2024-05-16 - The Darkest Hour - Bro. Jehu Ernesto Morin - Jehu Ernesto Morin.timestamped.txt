[33:16] escuchar tu palabra esa es nuestra
[33:18] petición

[33:23] Jesucristo pueden ustedes
[33:28] el momento más oscuro de la
[33:32] noche es un poco antes del
[33:36] amanecer nuestro tema en esta
[33:38] noche es la hora más
[33:42] oscura y cuando nosotros Hablamos de una
[33:44] hora
[33:46] oscura estamos hablando de tiempos
[33:49] difíciles de momentos de
[33:52] desilusión de momentos de
[33:55] desesperación un momento oscuro
[33:58] es como cuando alguien está en el
[34:00] hospital o cuando alguien va a hacer un
[34:02] análisis de su de su
[34:06] sangre y le van a decir la persona va
[34:10] nerviosa si es un examen
[34:15] decer o de alguna enfermedad
[34:18] delicada ve con el
[34:22] doctor y va temeroso
[34:28] en
[34:30] el anda
[34:32] preocupada Y es un momento
[34:34] oscuro el día de
[34:36] ayer una persona cercana a mí tuvo un
[34:41] accidente y cuando yo iba con con la
[34:44] persona a ver a la persona del
[34:47] accidente la persona iba
[34:50] nerviosa se sentía
[34:52] incómoda no sabía si
[34:55] llorar no sabía si hablar fuerte
[34:58] usted sabe se bloquean los
[35:01] sentidos Entonces los momentos
[35:05] difíciles vienen a nuestra vida y
[35:09] nuestro
[35:10] entendimiento nuestro
[35:12] razonamiento se
[35:15] bloquea no sabemos cómo actuar no
[35:18] sabemos qué decir y y cuando Nosotros
[35:21] hemos leído esta
[35:23] escritura cuando estamos hablando acerca
[35:25] de Lázaro
[35:27] en el
[35:28] sepulcro y aquí tenemos a dos personas
[35:32] más Marta y
[35:34] María profeta habla de
[35:37] ello y dice que le hablaron a
[35:40] Jesús y le mandaron un mensaje y le
[35:44] dijeron ven tu amigo Lázaro está muy
[35:47] enfermo y Tal parece que Jesús se fue un
[35:49] poquito más
[35:51] allá ahora él era amigo de
[35:54] ellos El Profeta dice viun
[36:01] os la esperanza de
[36:05] ellos estaba puesta en
[36:07] Jesús pi usted en
[36:10] esto tratemos de mirar ese
[36:14] lugar quizá era por la
[36:17] tarde y ellos habían estado
[36:20] preocupados por la salud de
[36:23] Lázaro diferentes personas
[36:27] creo que Lázaro no está poniéndose muy
[36:30] bien y va de mal en
[36:33] peor Marta y María estaban
[36:36] desesperadas y Tal parece que era un
[36:38] momento
[36:40] oscuro por porque no solamente era su
[36:44] hermano era el apoyo el soporte para la
[36:47] economía de la
[36:49] casa nos damos cuenta que la hora más
[36:53] oscura de tu vida
[36:59] tu mejor
[37:00] día la palabra del Señor nos dice en el
[37:04] libro de romanos
[37:06] 828 828 nos dice que todas las
[37:11] cosas ayudan a bien a los que aman a
[37:14] Dios Ahora nosotros
[37:17] pensamos qué de Bueno podemos sacar de
[37:19] un
[37:21] accidente qu de Bueno podemos sacar de
[37:23] una
[37:25] enfermedad buenar de un
[37:28] conflicto qué de Bueno podemos sacar de
[37:32] de una problema en el
[37:35] trabajo en nuestra mente se bloquea y
[37:38] nosotros no lo
[37:40] entendemos pero la hora más oscura de tu
[37:43] vida Dios está
[37:45] presente pero nosotros nosotros
[37:49] hermano tenemos
[37:51] imaginación tenemos
[37:53] conciencia tenemos
[37:55] razonamiento tenemos AF
[37:58] Y tenemos memoria pero Dios no trabaja
[38:01] con eso tenemos
[38:03] vista tenemos
[38:06] gusto tenemos tacto pero Dios no trabaja
[38:09] con eso Dios trabaja más
[38:12] profundo dentro del corazón del hombre
[38:16] hay una duda o hay una fe y Qué es la fe
[38:20] La fe es poder ver la fe es una
[38:23] revelación yo viene la fe
[38:27] señor no
[38:28] dice que la fe viene por el oír y el oír
[38:33] en la palabra de Dios conforme más Oyes
[38:36] conforme más
[38:38] escuchas conforme más lees conforme más
[38:42] tomas el
[38:43] mensaje algo se está anclando dentro de
[38:46] ti hay una revelación dentro de ti que
[38:50] tú sabes que
[38:51] sabes que sabes y estás
[38:54] seguro que él está contigo no lo sientes
[38:59] no lo ves Pero lo crees Por qué Porque
[39:02] él no anda por
[39:06] sentidos la La fe no viene por la fe no
[39:09] viene por
[39:11] sentidos la fe viene por creer en la
[39:14] palabra de Dios por qué su palabra dice
[39:18] que él es tu Amparo él es tu fortaleza
[39:21] que él es tu pronto auxilio en las
[39:23] tribulaciones Y si nosotros traemos esa
[39:26] palabra
[39:27] en el momento de nuestra
[39:30] tribulación el momento de nuestra
[39:32] angustia nosotros vemos a través de la
[39:35] escritura como David pudo
[39:38] expresar cuando é se sentía débil él
[39:42] dijo Por qué andaré yo
[39:44] enlutado porque yo andaré
[39:46] triste por la opresión del
[39:49] enemigo porque voy a andar de esa
[39:51] manera entonces é dice ahora recordaré
[39:58] es traer los eventos
[40:00] pasados al presente él dijo ahora
[40:04] recordaré có el señor sacó al pueblo de
[40:10] Egipto de Egipto Cómo cruzaron por el
[40:14] mar cómo pudieron cruzar por el mar cómo
[40:17] ellos se alegraron ahora me
[40:21] regocijaré en en lo que pasó hizo
[40:27] momentos más
[40:29] oscuros si nosotros vemos a través de la
[40:32] escritura nosotros vemos a un hombre
[40:34] llamado
[40:37] Sansón mató a más filisteos en su
[40:41] muerte ena un momento muy triste para
[40:44] Sansón era lo último pero pudo
[40:47] expresar una vez más señor él puso su
[40:51] confianza en el señor y dice la palabra
[40:54] del señor que él mató más personas en su
[41:00] muerte a través de de las etapas de su
[41:04] vida nosotros podemos ver a
[41:07] David David tuvo momentos
[41:10] difíciles en una ocasión vino
[41:13] León era una prueba muy
[41:15] dura era un momento de
[41:18] terror Pero qué fue lo que hizo en ese
[41:21] momento él se fue Se abalanzó en contra
[41:24] de León
[41:30] y nosotros vemos que después vino un
[41:33] oso era un momento muy
[41:35] difícil era un momento muy triste para
[41:40] él Ese oso quería robarse parte de sus
[41:45] ovejas pero en ese
[41:48] momento que parecía peor que parecía mal
[41:53] vino a ser unen
[41:56] día Endo iba en
[41:59] escala la prueba va en
[42:01] escala es como el día que va de Gloria
[42:05] en gloria de triunfo en
[42:08] triunfo Hasta que el día es
[42:10] perfecto el profeta nos habla y nos
[42:13] dice que todo
[42:15] creyente todo cristiano tiene que pasar
[42:18] por una lucha y una prueba todos los
[42:21] hijos de Dios tienen que ser
[42:24] probados tienen que pasar por eso
[42:27] para qué para que puedan ver la Victoria
[42:31] Si no hay una
[42:32] batalla si no hay una lucha no va a
[42:36] haber una victoria Y entonces nosotros
[42:39] vemos que después fue a pelear con
[42:42] Goliat él llegó simplemente de llevarle
[42:45] comida a sus
[42:47] hermanos porque su padre le había
[42:49] enviado
[42:50] ahí él llegó en el tiempo
[42:53] correcto y nosotros vemos Que Goliat
[42:55] estaba murmurando
[42:58] y Goliat estaba haciendo burla del
[43:02] pueblo y y él sintió eso y él dijo Quién
[43:07] es este
[43:09] incircunciso que está blasfemando que
[43:12] está hablando en
[43:13] contra del pueblo de Dios de los hijos
[43:16] de
[43:17] Dios él conocía su posición y era un
[43:21] momento
[43:22] triste sus hermanos vinieron y le
[43:26] dijeron nosotros conocemos tu corazón le
[43:29] dijeron en tu corazón hay
[43:31] soberbia has venido a burlarte has
[43:33] venido a ver
[43:35] esto y David dijo yo no he venido a esto
[43:38] é se sintió triste porque sus hermanos
[43:41] le estaban
[43:44] difamando Pero dijo yo puedo pelear con
[43:46] ese yo puedo hacerlo él tenía
[43:50] pruebas él tenía pruebas de que alguien
[43:53] había estado con él
[43:56] [Música]
[43:59] para él fue ir ahí con
[44:02] Go y cuando llegó con Go entonces tuvo
[44:06] un gran día lo que parecía
[44:09] triste lo que parecía
[44:12] angustioso lo que parecía que no tenía
[44:15] nada más que
[44:18] hacer de la tristeza Entonces ahora pas
[44:21] al
[44:22] gozo el pueblo estaba triste
[44:28] lastimado nosotros vemos A
[44:31] saul saul sus pies le temblaban sus
[44:35] rodillas chocaban Unas con
[44:37] otras y entonces él dijo Bueno yo no
[44:39] puedo pelear pero ahora nosotros vemos
[44:43] Que saul voltea y le dicen hay uno que
[44:46] puede pelear hay uno que quiere pelear y
[44:50] cuando lo trajeron él lo miró él
[44:54] solamente miraba a un jovencito 15
[44:58] dijo tú ve Ahora él empezó a ensalzar el
[45:02] enemigo é dijo Aquel aquel es un
[45:06] guerrero des su juventud aquel tiene una
[45:09] espada aquel tiene una lanza del tamaño
[45:12] de un
[45:13] telar aquel es
[45:16] poderoso saul estaba
[45:20] exaltando a la persona equivocada Pero
[45:23] ahí estaba la persona correcta
[45:29] dijo Bueno no puedes ir
[45:31] allá pero entonces le dijeron si él no
[45:35] va Alguien tiene que
[45:37] irse dijo Bueno póngale mi casco póngale
[45:41] mi armadura denle mi espada Pero eso no
[45:45] era por porque ella tenía
[45:48] pruebas pruebas
[45:50] indudables pruebas firmes se había
[45:53] peleado con el oso habí
[45:58] y ahora venía la prueba
[45:59] final y parecía que era un día mu muy
[46:04] triste pero cuando él mató al Goliat
[46:07] Entonces el pueblo tuvo
[46:09] energía el pueblo tuvo gozo y el pueblo
[46:13] fue y peleó allá y ganaron la batalla
[46:17] nosotros podemos
[46:20] ver como
[46:22] Moisés en el tiempo más
[46:25] triste uno de susas
[46:28] pruebas era una prueba de
[46:30] angustia el enemigo estaba atrás el mal
[46:34] estaba enfrente no había donde ir
[46:38] nosotros vemos a través de la Biblia
[46:40] vemos a través del
[46:42] mensaje como el profeta habla y dice Por
[46:45] qué
[46:48] clamas di la
[46:50] palabra di la palabra es tu tiempo es
[46:54] nuestro tiempo para decir la palabra
[46:57] y quisiera citar esto como el profeta
[47:00] nos dice que usted cuando tiene la
[47:05] prueba cuando tiene la lucha dice el
[47:08] profeta más de 17 veces dice sí a
[47:12] Satanás
[47:13] Satanás
[47:15] Dios puede
[47:18] derrotarte en cualquier lugar en
[47:20] cualquier momento a cualquier hora y
[47:24] donde sea dice dice él Tómese
[47:28] esto estas frases no se le olviden dice
[47:31] profeta usted tiene poder tenemos poder
[47:36] para citarle a Satanás el escrito
[47:39] está Jesús le dijo en sus pruebas las
[47:44] tres pruebas que tuvo é dijo escrito
[47:47] está escrito está escrito está y con lo
[47:51] único que nosotros podemos vencer es con
[47:55] el escrito está
[47:57] en elro momento
[47:59] difícil podemos voltar y decirle al
[48:03] enemigo yo en el nombre del señor
[48:07] Jesucristo te voy a decir lo que me dijo
[48:09] un
[48:10] profeta Satanás estás
[48:13] Derrotado puedes pelear conmigo en
[48:16] cualquier lugar en cualquier momento en
[48:20] cualquier tiempo pero siempre estará
[48:22] Derrotado Porque allá en la cruz del
[48:25] Calvario señor
[48:27] Jesucristo le dio un tremendo
[48:31] golpe él pagó el precio por qué pagó el
[48:35] precio por tu salud por tu sanidad por
[48:39] tu
[48:40] salvación por tu
[48:42] redención tú eres un redimido Y por qué
[48:45] somos
[48:46] Redimidos por la sangre del cordero y
[48:49] qué Ese
[48:50] redimido es volver a nuestro estado
[48:54] original Pero tiene que pasar la lucha
[48:57] tiene que pasar esos momentos Oh es que
[49:00] yo no siento a Dios Oh es que me siento
[49:03] cansado Oh me siento
[49:06] desilusionado Oh siento que esto es
[49:09] difícil pero el profeta lo dice no es si
[49:12] lo
[49:13] sentiste Es que yo creo que soy parte de
[49:17] esa novia Yo creo que soy
[49:21] contado entre los Escogidos de Dios y me
[49:25] gusta esa palabra que profeta utiliza yo
[49:29] pertenezco yo soy la novia la señorita
[49:34] Jesucristo y la señorita
[49:38] Jesucristo no puede dar para atrás ella
[49:41] va hacia
[49:42] adelante ve entonces en el momento
[49:45] difícil para para
[49:48] Moisés en el más triste de todos sus y
[49:51] peores
[49:52] momentos en su prueba de angustia
[49:56] sucedió Dios le abrió el mar se abrió el
[50:00] mar y el profeta dice dice un escritor
[50:06] dijo dios miró con sus ojos el
[50:10] mar y el mar se hizo a
[50:13] lado y el pueblo inició a
[50:16] caminar piense en esto pi un momento
[50:20] triste de los jóvenes hebreos
[50:28] yenes
[50:31] hebos momento triste para
[50:34] os los trajeron y les dijeron Bueno
[50:37] ahora es su tiempo de
[50:39] ustedes a ustedes los encontraron
[50:42] haciendo esto no quieren
[50:44] arrodillarse y como no quieren
[50:47] arrodillarse entonces tienen que pagar
[50:49] el
[50:50] precio y el precio de esto es que tiene
[50:53] que ir al horno
[50:55] ardi puede usted imaginar
[50:58] eso un momento
[51:01] triste un momento de
[51:04] desilusión le ha pasado a
[51:06] usted que ha esperado ustedes madres han
[51:09] esperado a sus
[51:11] hijos han orado por sus hijos han orado
[51:14] por sus
[51:15] hijas y tal vez Tal parece que entre más
[51:19] oran entre más platican con
[51:21] ellos hacen lo contrario a lo que
[51:25] ustedes les dijeron Y ustedes dicen
[51:27] señor dónde
[51:28] estás allí está el señor parece un peor
[51:33] momento parece un momento muy
[51:37] nostálgico estaba viendo como el
[51:41] profeta habla de uno de sus momentos más
[51:45] tristes una de sus horas más
[51:48] oscuras dice yo estaba allí en la
[51:50] Clínica
[51:52] May y él lo predica en cre esto en el
[51:55] año 50
[51:57] y él dice Estando yo í la Clínica
[52:00] Mayo cuando los mejores médicos entraron
[52:03] y dijeron reverendo bram No hay
[52:05] esperanza para
[52:07] usted y le dijeron usted nunca se
[52:10] recuperar de eso y le dijeron usted está
[52:16] acabado y dice la hora más
[52:19] oscura que alguna vez haya
[52:22] presenciado Y entonces llegó
[52:25] jes en ese momento que llegó dice é
[52:29] cuánto lo amo o cuando medito en
[52:33] esto y pienso cu es lo que él ha hecho
[52:36] por
[52:37] mí fue su Sublime
[52:40] Gracia la

[52:54] solución aquí

[52:59] cerraron y entonces hermano usted va con
[53:02] el amigo va con la
[53:04] persona todo se cerró pero hermano hay
[53:08] un
[53:09] cielo un cielo lleno de
[53:11] bendiciones un cielo lleno de
[53:14] bendiciones el profeta nos habla y nos
[53:18] dice todas las promesas de esta
[53:20] Biblia son para sus hijos hay un cielo
[53:23] lleno de
[53:24] bendiciones y profet menciona porque las
[53:28] promesas de Dios son perfectas son
[53:32] únicas las promesas de Dios llegan
[53:36] exactamente en su
[53:38] tiempo no en la hora que tú quieres no
[53:41] en el momento que tú
[53:43] quieres y en otro mensaje dice Tú tienes
[53:47] que entrar en
[53:48] desesperación y Qué es
[53:50] desesperación tienes que entrar en una
[53:53] urgencia en un estado de emergencia
[53:57] y Cuando entras en un estado de
[53:59] emergencia hermano ya no piensas tus
[54:02] sentidos ya no

[54:22] ha yo soy tu Amparo
[54:27] yo soy tu pronto
[54:29] auxilio en tus
[54:31] tribulaciones porque él es el
[54:33] señor que sana todas nuestras dolencias
[54:38] en nuestros momentos
[54:40] oscuros cuál maravilloso dice el
[54:43] profeta cuando él llega en las horas más
[54:47] oscuras así está el sanador
[54:50] divino Allí está el sanador
[54:53] divino cuando Lázaro estaba vivo
[54:57] él está entrando disimuladamente en la
[55:00] ciudad y dice fíjese María Marta
[55:04] discúlpenme lea la historia ustedes
[55:07] ahí ustedes pueden ver cuando el señor
[55:11] llegó a ese
[55:14] lugar mar María estaba muy
[55:21] tristes dice profeta usted puede el
[55:24] momento más triste
[55:27] de mucha
[55:28] angustia su único
[55:31] hermano ya no estaba
[55:33] ahí qué hora tan
[55:36] oscura sacaron al hombre el profeta lo
[55:39] habla se
[55:42] loar y lo pusieron allá en una cueva
[55:44] abajo en el
[55:45] suelo y le pusieron una roca
[55:48] en lo cual es el típico entierro del Ori
[55:56] entonces pasó el primer
[55:58] día el segundo día el tercer día todos
[56:03] los gusanos de la piel empezaron a
[56:05] entrar empezaron a
[56:08] comerlo la primer cosa que se comieron
[56:10] fue la
[56:12] nariz y al rato empezó a corromperse y
[56:15] ap
[56:16] podrirse llegaron por ahí los
[56:19] insectos junto con los
[56:22] gusanos empezaron a devorar el cuerpo
[56:27] parte de su
[56:28] cuerpo a los cu días ya hay día ya
[56:37] díaa después a las 72
[56:41] horas la corrupción
[56:44] comenzó todas las esperanzas se habían
[56:47] ido todo se había perdido pero ahí est
[56:52] y hab dejado su iglesia
[56:56] todo lo que
[56:57] tení allá estaba su hermano
[57:00] muerto el hombre en el cual habían
[57:02] depositado toda su
[57:05] confianza siendo el hombre más
[57:07] importante que andaba de aquí para
[57:11] allá andaba haciendo milagros en Aquel
[57:14] lugar y en el otro lugar en el otro
[57:18] lugar le mandaron un
[57:21] mensajito llegó el mensaje por esa
[57:23] persona que le
[57:25] habló dijeron de lo que estaba pasando
[57:29] Pero sabía lo que estaba pasando hebreos
[57:32] 138 nos lo
[57:33] dice Jesucristo es el mismo Ayer hoy y
[57:37] por todos los
[57:38] siglos ellos pensaron que lo habían
[57:43] abandonado y que se había
[57:45] ido no quiso venir cuando lo mandaron
[57:50] Buscar era la hora más
[57:53] oscura que la pequeña familia hab

[1:07:13] atmosfera esa atmósfera es de usted
[1:07:17] porque usted es
[1:07:18] creador cuando cayó allí empezó a

[1:25:43] no está
[1:25:44] aprendiendo no él es perfecto la primera
[1:25:48] la primera respuesta que

[1:25:53] tercera que va a dar
[1:25:55] él no cambia su palabra porque su

[1:26:00] Jehová no me no cambio no me mudo si te
[1:26:05] di la bendición hoy te la voy a dar
