[13:03] Lord around the world what it must be
[13:05] the needs amongst your children Lord but
[13:08] you're well able we thank you we commit
[13:10] them to you we think of
[13:11] Erica Parker there in Tennessee Lord

[13:16] in her line of duty Lord this would just
[13:18] be an attack of the enemy

[13:26] for Rebecca page Lord we also are

[13:32] little Theo and Josiah the needs in this
[13:34] body Lord that are so pressing and we
[13:38] continually hold them before you Lord
[13:40] and the many others that are mentioned
[13:41] we
[13:43] ask your divine
[13:45] guidance Lord and presence in each one
[13:47] of those needs we ask thy presence with
[13:49] us tonight in this service
[13:51] thank you again for this opportunity to
[13:53] be together with Believers of like
[13:56] Precious Faith Lord we ask these things
[13:58] in these favors in the name of the Lord
[14:00] Jesus Christ
[14:01] amen
[14:03] amen you want to be seated in just a
[14:04] moment I'll just give you this
[14:06] testimonies real fresh it was just last
[14:08] night we were driving home we'd taken
[14:11] the saccharine
[14:12] for Zachary taking Justice and Audrey
[14:15] out and Elizabeth for dinner but we were
[14:17] driving home it was 8 30. on Highway 69
[14:20] there's 65 mile an hour speed limit so
[14:22] we're coming home on that stretch and I
[14:25] don't have the high beams on because
[14:26] there's traffic on the other side of the
[14:27] highway it's divided but you have your
[14:29] low beams on because there's cars coming
[14:31] on the other side there and Justice was
[14:34] in the back seat but I just thank the
[14:35] Lord he was he was watching the road he
[14:36] could have been dozing or doing anything
[14:38] but he hollered at me bad or watch out
[14:41] or whatever
[14:42] and and it was you didn't didn't even
[14:44] have a millisecond there was a man
[14:46] running down the highway right in the
[14:48] middle of the road right towards our
[14:49] vehicle
[14:51] so again if it if he hadn't hauler
[14:55] in less than a tenth of a second we'd
[14:57] have struck get me to kill the man so
[15:00] you veered really hard and he just swept
[15:02] by us on the passenger side there you
[15:04] know and
[15:05] so it just your nerves it just shoots
[15:06] your nerves you know but we turned
[15:08] around and went and found him he was on
[15:10] the shoulder then and he was drunk and
[15:12] he said his fiancee had kicked him out
[15:14] of the car or dropped him off or
[15:15] something he was trying to find his way
[15:16] here
[15:18] um but it just you know even if you're
[15:20] not at fault if you kill somebody I
[15:23] haven't experienced it but I'm sure it's
[15:25] just probably haunts you the rest of
[15:27] your life that kind of a thing so we're
[15:29] very thankful to the Lord then he spared
[15:31] us from that
[15:33] so that was just real fresh so thank the
[15:36] Lord he's never prison help
[15:39] could I just make an announcement about
[15:40] the schedule this weekend too so because
[15:43] we haven't announced the time that we
[15:44] want the young people up at the Rancho
[15:45] I'll do that but Friday night 7 30.
[15:47] brother James and I were just looking at
[15:49] the senior youth room and I've we've
[15:51] decided we'll be here in the sanctuary
[15:53] because I think we'll probably have our
[15:55] own Youth Of course in junior Youth and
[15:57] then probably 30 visitors that aren't
[15:59] from the assembly so I think we'll be
[16:02] might be too crowded in there so let's
[16:03] just settle it we'll have these four
[16:05] rows right down here right where they
[16:06] close the lower bowl here right in this
[16:08] section here so and then Zachary's real
[16:11] short too and I saw the platform and
[16:12] there's only five inches so he probably
[16:15] needs to be up a little bit more where
[16:17] people can see him so that would be in
[16:20] here at 7 30. and then also if the
[16:22] junior youth have parents that are
[16:23] bringing your kids
[16:25] join us I would say there's lots of room
[16:27] in the back please you know you don't
[16:28] have to drop them off and leave you're
[16:29] sure welcome to stay and also if I can
[16:31] have the Liberty to say that most of the
[16:33] young marrieds here were Zachary my son
[16:35] Zachary's Palace since they were little
[16:37] kids and uh so I think any of the young
[16:40] marriage that would like to come sit in
[16:42] on service if I have the authority I'd
[16:45] say you're sure welcome to come I think
[16:47] Zachary would be a joy for him to see
[16:48] you also so that's all the love all boys
[16:51] in Stephen Minard and just basically all
[16:53] the young marrieds I guess here so then
[16:56] Saturday morning 11 o'clock
[16:59] we're going to meet out at the ranch
[17:01] there and this is kind of a key and I
[17:03] don't see a bunch of our African Saints
[17:04] but I know you're brother you're going
[17:07] to get the announcement out now that
[17:09] it's 11 o'clock but we're going to hike
[17:11] from the ranch two miles to where our
[17:13] picnic spot is down by the creek so if
[17:15] if anybody shows a blade there's going
[17:17] to be nobody there and you're going to
[17:19] just be lost so of course you can call
[17:21] me too but ideally if you're there at 11
[17:24] to follow the Entourage on our hike down
[17:27] to the picnic spot that would be ideal
[17:30] and then if you happen to get there late
[17:33] I would say hopefully have my number
[17:34] maybe we'll post it on the youth chat so
[17:36] that everybody has my number if they're
[17:38] lost so a picnic at the creek down there
[17:41] and then back to the ranch for the
[17:43] afternoon for activities and then
[17:45] Elizabeth's going to feed everybody also
[17:47] in the evening
[17:48] lasagna and Toscana soup and and then
[17:52] we'll have an open air service there
[17:54] after after an early dinner there at the
[17:58] ranch so should be all done probably by
[18:00] seven o'clock in the evening
[18:03] and I think that's all
[18:06] don't be late okay God bless you bless
[18:10] you
[18:11] appreciate them opening their home for
[18:13] the young people it's been a very
[18:14] blessing
[18:16] I got the thinking man sure wish I had
[18:18] that when I was growing up
[18:20] a pretty fun place up there just one
[18:22] quick announcement and I hate bringing
[18:25] this phone to the pulpit but I have to
[18:26] get this right so
[18:29] um for the VBS there's only 25 kids
[18:32] registered so far online so the children
[18:34] need to be signed up online not just on
[18:36] the bulletin board so I don't know if
[18:37] there was some confusion there and the
[18:40] deadline for the registration is this
[18:41] coming Sunday the 21st so just in case

[33:05] things to touch hearts hearts Lord be
[33:08] touched by the spirit of God
[33:12] not us Lord ourselves but may you work

[33:19] we ask you now Lord to take over the
[33:21] service that's our hearts give us an
[33:25] understanding Lord we believe
[33:28] and thereby we receive
[33:30] and we thank you now in Jesus Christ's
[33:33] name amen amen God bless you you may be
[33:37] seated
[33:40] looks good to see each one of you out to
[33:42] the house of the Lord today and
[33:45] enjoying the good things that God has
[33:47] for us
[33:48] the desire My Heart Is you know I was
[33:51] looking at a lesson to preach
[33:54] and it was about that eagle
[33:58] and the thing was he just flew around
[34:00] and finally Mama flew by and
[34:03] she saw him down there and she let out a
[34:06] scream and
[34:08] he saw just looked over for a while and
[34:11] then all of a sudden she flew off his
[34:14] wingspan was about seven feet in width
[34:16] and
[34:18] but what got me and it was is that that
[34:23] little bird he got in there to talking
[34:25] to his mama
[34:27] and she was a little hen
[34:30] and the scene of it was he wanted to
[34:32] know how in the world that hen ever got
[34:35] her to begin with
[34:40] how many of you ever got that
[34:43] hen
[34:44] when you belong to Christ through the
[34:46] whole matter
[34:48] okay
[34:49] so as he asked he said well you know my
[34:52] brother and sisters out here they're
[34:54] eating out here like everything
[34:57] I can't stand the food
[35:00] and there ain't nothing here for me to
[35:02] eat mom
[35:04] she said well I don't know she said you
[35:06] were my hand
[35:08] and I had you and there he stood but he
[35:11] all of a sudden said but today
[35:14] I had a eagle stop in
[35:17] and made some statements upon me
[35:21] friends you know that might be idle
[35:23] statements
[35:25] but a lot of things in our life has
[35:27] ceased to be
[35:29] of that that it ought to be before God
[35:33] we talk about a Rapture talk about a
[35:36] resurrection talk about the powers of
[35:38] God and I'm not here to be critical
[35:41] but the more you hear about it the more
[35:43] you ought to act like it amen amen
[35:46] you're not looking for another place to
[35:48] spend the night you're looking for a
[35:49] Rapture to get out of this place and go
[35:52] see Jesus
[35:53] amen and when you look around you see a
[35:56] lot of your friends your hens and your
[35:59] the little Bobs and the girls and
[36:01] everybody's out there dancing having a
[36:03] big time out there
[36:04] and you're saying to yourself to the
[36:06] lady that I I can't understand it
[36:10] and I heard that eagle screamed to me
[36:12] today and said come on
[36:15] and I thought wouldn't that be a
[36:16] pleasure to stay to hear that same cry
[36:20] to you come out from among them and be
[36:24] separate saith the Lord amen start
[36:27] supplying certain things that give to
[36:30] life greater is he that is in you than
[36:34] he that's in the world
[36:36] amen and there ought to be some kind of
[36:38] a testament going on sometimes when I
[36:41] look at Sunday and I look at the people
[36:43] and all that's here I'm thinking how
[36:46] many of you people are touching God for
[36:48] the needs that people have within their
[36:51] life and within their desires and how
[36:55] badly we need the church on fire for God
[36:59] is that not the truth
[37:01] amen we was raised to be Eagles
[37:05] we was ready to be what God would have
[37:08] us to be
[37:09] and I look at myself sometimes and I
[37:12] wonder you know what's an eagle look
[37:15] like what does he act like how does he
[37:17] fly around about but nevertheless today
[37:20] that is higher my heart is to find him
[37:24] more real to you or I with all of the
[37:27] things that God has for us Amen to look
[37:31] towards him instead of looking towards
[37:33] everything else I have a scripture this
[37:36] morning or this afternoon
[37:39] I'd like to read to you and I'd like to
[37:41] talk to you about some of the I mean you
[37:44] know it's it's very difficult
[37:48] when you
[37:49] look at the scriptures and you try to
[37:53] find what I just told you
[37:55] and I went through some papers to find
[37:58] out years ago brother Branham spoke of
[38:00] that
[38:02] Eagle that got stirred and was called
[38:05] out to that place and put into action
[38:08] when today we talk about it and don't
[38:10] even move anything about it
[38:14] in other words that's why I thought I'm
[38:15] going to ask how the hen's doing
[38:17] they're not even feeding me how's its
[38:20] dudes and all these things going on you
[38:23] say well it's not moving I have no
[38:25] burdens I have no leadership I have no
[38:27] guidance
[38:29] you say why do you can I ask you that
[38:31] why do you want to be an overcomer
[38:35] because I want to go to be with Jesus
[38:38] amen I want to be a candidate for the
[38:42] things that God would have for me to be
[38:45] and there's no one can do that but you
[38:48] greater is he that is in you than he
[38:51] that is in the world
[38:53] amen and so uh and all of the story that
[38:58] went on brother Branham made mention of
[39:00] it I looked up another scripture to read
[39:03] it to you this morning so it would help
[39:05] you it's found in Isaiah chapter 40 and
[39:09] beginning at verse 30 and 31.
[39:13] it says even the youth shall faint and
[39:16] be weary and the young man shall utterly
[39:19] fall
[39:20] but they that wait upon the Lord
[39:23] shall renew their strength
[39:26] can I say it again they that wait upon
[39:29] the Lord
[39:31] how many of you believe it pays to wait
[39:38] it does pay it away
[39:41] and we're going to talk about some of
[39:43] those things tonight
[39:45] he goes on to say here
[39:48] to wait that the Lord shall renew their
[39:51] strength they shall Mount up with wings
[39:54] as eagles they shall run
[39:57] and not be weary
[39:59] and they shall walk and they shall not
[40:03] faint
[40:04] you don't have to stagger don't have to
[40:06] weep don't have to cry all we are is
[40:09] Believers that believe the things that
[40:12] God would have for us
[40:14] amen you may be seated God bless you
[40:19] looking at these things this evening in
[40:24] being invited to minister here by
[40:26] brother Ron I want to say it's a
[40:30] pleasure to be here
[40:32] and to desire My Heart friends Above All
[40:35] Things is to see Jesus
[40:38] I want to know him personally
[40:40] I want to know him with the power of the
[40:43] Resurrection
[40:44] I want to see him alive in my life how
[40:47] many of you can say that Overcomers in
[40:50] him
[40:51] amen and looking at the word of God and
[40:54] looking at the issues and the problems
[40:58] that we are I've been talking to that
[40:59] hint about certain things all of a
[41:02] sudden by the grace of God I want to
[41:04] take the flight
[41:06] I want to rise up to the power of Mama
[41:09] eagle
[41:10] I want to take that soaring out of that
[41:13] place and I want to solve around
[41:15] wherever she goes I want to talk about
[41:18] the things that God has for us
[41:22] and as we
[41:23] talk about these things the power of
[41:27] those that live within us
[41:30] you know I think about myself I think
[41:33] about how God has called us to deeper
[41:36] depths and higher Heights with Christ
[41:38] amen all things are possible to them
[41:41] that believe
[41:43] greater is he that's in me than he
[41:46] that's in the world
[41:47] you believe that
[41:49] amen it just takes a little bit of your
[41:52] attention to begin to believe
[41:55] but as I read this and as I look at this
[41:58] I look at myself because I desire to be
[42:02] an overcomer in Christ I deserve desire
[42:06] to have the victory Of God through the
[42:09] things of my life and I've got a few of
[42:12] those things to
[42:14] mentioned to you they got a few people
[42:16] going to be here today I believe in one
[42:19] of them is going to be brother Branham I
[42:21] believe and one of the things he's going
[42:22] to talk about is a super sense
[42:26] how many of you could stand a little
[42:28] better sense
[42:29] a little super sense huh this is the way
[42:34] walking in it huh amen and I Delight to
[42:38] hear those things because what it does
[42:41] is the normal part helps your eyesight
[42:44] helps your speech helps your ears help
[42:47] everything like that but when you get
[42:48] the super sense it comes from God you
[42:51] get baptized with the baptism of the
[42:54] Holy Ghost and you're Walking With God
[42:56] all things then become possible to you
[42:59] that believe you don't just quit because
[43:02] of what you see you don't quit because
[43:04] of what you hear but you walk because
[43:07] you believe that greater is he that's in
[43:09] us than he that's in the world and my
[43:12] desire is to stay as we look at these
[43:15] thoughts my opinion is to get myself
[43:18] ready for the approach of Jesus Christ
[43:21] to leave here I want to be ready
[43:25] I want to think like he thinks I want to
[43:28] talk like he talks I want to be just
[43:30] like him
[43:31] amen and because of these things in our
[43:34] life what a what a need it is in our
[43:37] life
[43:38] and so many times and I don't mean to be
[43:41] critical by my speech but I just want to
[43:43] bring some things out but I think as
[43:46] these men looking and as that uh
[43:50] we look at these quotes that God has
[43:53] made may God help us to make the proper
[43:56] looks and the proper opinion that makes
[43:59] us what we ought to be
[44:01] and I want to be I've been following the
[44:04] Lord for 50 55 60 years I don't know but
[44:08] you know the thing that I want I want
[44:10] him more than I've ever known him
[44:12] I want him to break up this old man and
[44:14] make it something that's worth something
[44:18] and you know when I look at this and I
[44:21] look at the word of God and I think of
[44:23] things you know I hear people sometimes
[44:26] they say well you know faith faith I say
[44:28] to myself wait a minute
[44:32] y'all be more sincere about faith
[44:35] faith is a statement that we talk like
[44:37] it's nothing but it'll change your
[44:39] entire life
[44:41] and the thing of it is it ought to it
[44:44] ought to move mountains it ought to open
[44:46] up lives it ought to do everything
[44:47] because you're a believer in Christ and
[44:51] you got to believe him something has got
[44:54] to happen to you to ever get you to be a
[44:57] mover in Christ
[44:59] and so as we hear these things and as we
[45:03] believe and we preach and we want to
[45:05] become greater Sons and Daughters of God
[45:07] we must become better uh faith believing
[45:12] people believe that the man that we're
[45:15] talking about tonight I believe is a
[45:17] perfect stature visiting with us may he
[45:21] be with us tonight
[45:25] I haven't preached for a long time but I
[45:27] won't look it up now but I want to I
[45:30] want to say to you that
[45:32] when he came about he told you certain
[45:35] things and he did it he said at first
[45:37] was his Temple of this test the next
[45:41] thing was the things that he did the
[45:43] third thing was Tempest and fourth was
[45:47] saying something else it moved right up
[45:49] to the top of everything the top was
[45:51] love it brought God into the assembly
[45:54] and I thought to myself God I don't only
[45:56] need it and I'll tell you something else
[45:59] what makes faith move is something
[46:03] happens in here
[46:04] without this you don't have this when
[46:09] God goes to dealing with you because of
[46:11] situations in your life needs that you
[46:15] have need of there's something begins to
[46:17] work in here your faith begins to do
[46:20] business with the one that lives in here
[46:23] and all of a sudden now you add virtue
[46:26] and things to your faith you add this to
[46:28] your faith you add this to your faith
[46:31] you add Temperance to your faith you add
[46:33] this to your faith and that to your
[46:35] faith and the first thing you know you
[46:37] got a faith that's empowered by not just
[46:40] by us talking about it but by the the
[46:43] powers of God Amen I want Faith to move
[46:48] those trials that I have I want to see
[46:51] lives changed I want to see the sick
[46:54] healed I want to see the dead raised
[46:57] whatever it is that God wants I want to
[47:00] see it amen because the thing of it is
[47:03] that in our life who lives my life I
[47:07] want to grow Grace in Jesus Christ
[47:11] and as we look at the word of God today
[47:13] and we hear these preachers now I trust
[47:16] honestly
[47:18] that you also open these books and you
[47:22] begin to read them
[47:24] and you say well you know I haven't read
[47:26] this in 10 years
[47:29] some of these are 1950s
[47:33] you said well I wouldn't read it because
[47:34] there's no power in them
[47:37] I beg to differ that with you
[47:40] amen I'll tell you that anyone you want
[47:42] to read it will Empower your life
[47:45] it'll put a vision in you that'll make
[47:48] you want to grow better and more deeper
[47:50] than you've ever been
[47:52] and so as we look at these opinions and
[47:55] we begin to consider the certain things
[47:58] the tests and the trials that go on with
[48:01] that Mama eagle and what she's trying to
[48:04] do is make us Sons and Daughters of God
[48:06] and here we are today trying our best to
[48:10] learn those things
[48:13] and I think as we look at the word of
[48:15] God and I think as we come to church and
[48:18] we see the things that God is doing I I
[48:22] think that God is testing us
[48:25] trying us
[48:27] testing us to find out if we believe God
[48:30] to be those things that he promises them
[48:34] to be for us
[48:36] and the thing of it is is that when I
[48:39] look at it and I looked at these I
[48:41] thought God I walk around and I see my
[48:44] sight and I say to myself I'm always
[48:47] carnal anyhow
[48:50] and then I walk on a little further and
[48:52] I say something else and I say God
[48:55] and the thing of it is is that you begin
[48:58] to realize that you don't need sight
[49:01] what you need is that Supernatural
[49:03] spirit of God to come into your life
[49:05] because that's what he said I never said
[49:09] it when things you get five gifts from
[49:13] almighty God
[49:15] at your birth God will give you sight
[49:18] God will give you sound God will give
[49:20] you hearing he'll do all those five
[49:22] things but when it comes to the sixth it
[49:26] has to come from God and it is the power
[49:29] of the presence of God alive in our life
[49:33] a friend said ought to be there in order
[49:36] to put a smile on your face it ought to
[49:39] put a Stillness in your heart it ought
[49:42] to say greater is he that's in me than
[49:44] he that's in the world and it ought to
[49:46] cause us to actually do things Miracles
[49:50] power and God Odyssey present in our
[49:53] life
[49:54] and so why we try our best to improve on
[49:57] our eyesight to improve on our speech
[50:00] all the time God's trying to put a a
[50:03] better Creation in you a better
[50:05] understanding of what God has has got
[50:08] for you a supernatural
[50:11] power that God has that power to go into
[50:14] your life how many of you would like
[50:16] that change
[50:19] how many of you would like to be
[50:21] quickened by the power of God they were
[50:23] so powerful by God it would Quicken your
[50:27] mortal life
[50:32] that's a quickening of the mortal
[50:35] when I read that I laid down on my face
[50:37] and all of a sudden my body got to
[50:40] feeling better and I stood up
[50:42] and I said Thank You Jesus because you
[50:46] do take care of this Mortal
[50:48] quickening is him if God can't tell you
[50:51] something to Quicken your opinion you
[50:53] got problems
[50:55] greater is he that's in you than he
[50:57] that's in the world he ought to he ought
[50:59] to say y'all to think like that you want
[51:01] to talk like that try to do like that
[51:04] and yet we hear that and we pass it up a
[51:07] lot of things may not matter to us and
[51:09] I'm not trying to be critical
[51:12] but the thing that we want today is we
[51:14] want Christ to become alive in our life
[51:17] amen amen he said one day he said we
[51:19] want to go to Tucson we're going to
[51:21] bring everybody together
[51:23] he said but we've got to get the car
[51:25] ready to go
[51:27] so I want you to test your engine
[51:29] oh you don't have no gas well then you
[51:32] can't go
[51:33] oh you don't have this then you can't do
[51:35] it
[51:36] so we're going to test something you got
[51:38] to bring the car
[51:39] you got to check the motor you got to
[51:42] check the gas you got to check the air
[51:44] you got to check all those things before
[51:47] you're fitting to go to Tucson
[51:51] and the thing in life is the same way a
[51:53] lot of things in our life they don't
[51:54] matter Mama don't matter no more daddy
[51:56] don't matter kids don't matter business
[51:58] don't matter Church doesn't matter
[52:00] people's hurts don't matter
[52:04] friends that ought to hurt you so bad
[52:06] you say yes for me in my house
[52:09] amen I'm gonna do something for God or
[52:12] I'm going to find out
[52:14] and I think that in our lives brothers
[52:17] and sisters and I'm talking to myself my
[52:20] desire is to become more like Christ
[52:23] that's what I desire I haven't preached
[52:26] for a long time because I had an
[52:28] accident but I'm telling you in my life
[52:30] he has got to live he's got to be the
[52:34] quickness Michael yes sir
[52:38] how many of you move under that type of
[52:40] leadership
[52:41] hello
[52:44] that's about 10.
[52:48] serious guys
[52:51] serious
[52:53] I mean that's almighty God
[52:57] trying to control you to do something
[53:00] for you
[53:02] he's not trying to send you out to work
[53:04] if I could say that he's trying to
[53:07] improve that spiritual condition in him
[53:12] and in us we ought to move by the spirit
[53:15] of God or the leadership that God would
[53:18] have for us and yet as we look at life
[53:20] what a strange thing it is
[53:24] and I look at this in the scripture here
[53:27] and I'm thinking about that eagle and I
[53:29] thought about all the tests and trials
[53:32] and I think about the life that I have I
[53:35] I want to be more like Christ than I've
[53:38] ever been in my life
[53:39] and I want to tell you something about
[53:42] Christ he says and does many things to
[53:45] get your attention is that true
[53:48] how many times has he answered prayer
[53:51] for you to find out just how attentive
[53:54] you are to the ways of God
[53:58] sometimes if God says your calls you you
[54:00] obey him
[54:02] but then it just goes from one to the
[54:04] other you haven't learned nothing nor do
[54:06] we become different
[54:08] friends when you find out that you're
[54:10] his and he is yours it ought to make a
[54:14] difference to your life
[54:16] amen you've got more power now than just
[54:20] uh doing nothing you've got power to
[54:23] heal the sick you've got power to touch
[54:25] your wife you've got power to touch this
[54:27] you got power and God becomes
[54:29] responsible for the needs that we have
[54:32] in our life
[54:33] people that search God find God and
[54:36] those that find God they become obedient
[54:38] to God
[54:40] amen and as you read through the
[54:43] scriptures today you find that Brethren
[54:46] are trying their best today to do just
[54:48] that they live for God so that God lives
[54:51] for them
[54:53] and I think that sometimes we get things
[54:57] turned around I don't mean to be ugly
[54:59] about my statements but I'm truthful
[55:03] about them I want God we need God I'm
[55:05] looking for a Rapture I need my heart
[55:07] changed
[55:09] I want my life changed amen and I know
[55:12] this we got a brother in the hospital
[55:14] over here all things are possible today
[55:17] to God that believe
[55:18] but as we look this morning after these
[55:21] things I'd like to turn over to Hebrews
[55:24] if we can Hebrews chapter 12 and verse
[55:27] 2.
[55:35] if we can find it here 12 and 2 looking
[55:38] unto Jesus huh
[55:42] I'm looking under my job or I'm looking
[55:45] at no I'm looking under
[55:47] The Authority the finisher of our faith
[55:50] who for the joy that was set before him
[55:53] endured the cross
[55:54] despising the shame and sat down at the
[55:58] right hand of the father of the I'm
[56:01] sorry at the right hand of the Throne of
[56:03] God
[56:05] you know when you read something do you
[56:08] ever read them and find out
[56:10] that you're not reading too good
[56:13] and you're just kind of Blazing over
[56:16] everything and catching part of it
[56:18] and sometimes when you pick up these
[56:20] scriptures looking unto Jesus the author
[56:23] and the finisher
[56:25] of my faith
[56:27] I want him to do a good job
[56:30] I want to be so positioned
[56:33] that my behavior is what God would have
[56:36] us to be
[56:38] and so as we go on here the author and
[56:40] finisher of my faith
[56:43] you know it was just a little while ago
[56:45] I was out with my brother and we were
[56:47] talking about faith
[56:49] and like I said
[56:51] it seems like I trying to Touch Faith
[56:54] but I couldn't get a hold of God
[56:57] see what I want in my heart I want to
[57:00] believe God and I want him to believe me
[57:03] Jesus loves you how many of you like
[57:06] that
[57:08] and then Heather maybe haven't talked to
[57:10] him for a month and maybe you're caught
[57:12] up in a lot of other ways and we wonder
[57:15] why we're alike we are
[57:17] but I got to wonder with conditions that
[57:20] were around my life I began to look at
[57:24] things and I said to myself it is
[57:27] missing the part that deals with faith
[57:31] he said first you add Faith to your life
[57:34] is that right
[57:36] I could get that man out here let me
[57:38] just pull it for fun just
[57:44] the statue of a perfect man would you
[57:46] like to have him here tonight
[57:49] first add to your faith virtue
[57:54] virtue knowledge
[57:57] but I don't need knowledge I just add
[58:00] faith
[58:01] but you gotta had knowledge virtue to
[58:05] the things that God has given us to have
[58:08] can you say Amen to that after you have
[58:10] that you then you have knowledge you had
[58:12] knowledge to your behavior and then the
[58:15] thing of it is you have Temperance
[58:17] people say things do things you get
[58:19] aggravated and yet with your Temperance
[58:22] you surrender your life to Christ amen
[58:26] and I think today it's the statue of a
[58:28] perfect man I don't think it would hurt
[58:30] anybody to buy them home
[58:35] nobody wants him to go home with you
[58:38] how many of you believe that you need
[58:41] this experience even tonight
[58:45] and the thing with it I'm not being
[58:47] critical I'm just stopping if that's
[58:49] true friends we got issues
[58:53] and I believe if anybody ought to touch
[58:55] a hole to Heaven it ought to be us
[58:58] because I want this to work now
[59:00] everybody preachers everything else he
[59:02] isn't Faith wonderful
[59:04] oh isn't it good and everybody screams
[59:07] yes
[59:08] and I would have to say I would say most
[59:11] of us have a problem with faith
[59:16] maybe it's not proving what it's
[59:19] supposed to prove maybe it's not talking
[59:21] like it's supposed to talk maybe it's
[59:24] the way you got it it don't matter
[59:27] but the thing of it is I believe as you
[59:30] look at your own lives the first thing
[59:33] you want in your life you want Faith but
[59:35] then you got to have virtue and then you
[59:38] got to have after you have that you have
[59:39] the knowledge then you have Temperance
[59:42] and now you're getting up there to where
[59:44] you ought to be and where the place that
[59:46] God would have you to be then you become
[59:49] patient and then you become brotherly
[59:52] kindness and then believe it or not you
[59:55] got the Holy Spirit
[59:57] you got that token
[1:00:01] I'm sure tonight we have that token how
[1:00:03] many of you got that token
[1:00:06] and I believe that a super person if we
[1:00:09] looked at him tonight
[1:00:11] I believe the gift of wisdom Was that
[1:00:14] gift that God gave not the five
[1:00:18] but the sixth give was the power of that
[1:00:21] Holy Spirit into your life and mine
[1:00:25] and so as we're talking here
[1:00:29] we just get it up to the top of the
[1:00:31] pyramid and that's love
[1:00:34] how many of you have loved for everybody
[1:00:38] one two
[1:00:42] yeah I'm not being cruel I'm just
[1:00:44] telling you brothers and says honestly
[1:00:47] your attitudes can get to a place how
[1:00:50] many of you believe all things are
[1:00:52] possible are you in the capability of
[1:00:55] changing things
[1:00:57] you believe is that right amen and God
[1:01:00] does things so that you can prove it and
[1:01:03] we're going to talk about him here in
[1:01:05] just a little bit but that's exactly
[1:01:08] what goes on is that there's proof and
[1:01:11] then the last thing is love friends
[1:01:13] without love in our lives what have we
[1:01:15] got and I always stand up and talk about
[1:01:18] I can't wait for the Rapture to get here
[1:01:20] when you might as well tell it goodbye
[1:01:23] because it ain't coming
[1:01:29] you say brother Mike you're in a hard
[1:01:31] man
[1:01:32] then let's get to Statue of a perfect
[1:01:34] man and let's find out if you really got
[1:01:37] faith
[1:01:38] or have you got what the church things
[1:01:41] faith is Faith or if you believe to a
[1:01:44] degree that whatever comes to you you
[1:01:46] believe that God has that ability to
[1:01:49] change your life
[1:01:50] and that's what we're talking about here
[1:01:52] today about these things that that when
[1:01:55] that eagle goes flying you may not know
[1:01:57] what she ever is going to eat
[1:02:00] you may not know where she's gonna fly
[1:02:02] but it sure beats that Mama hand
[1:02:06] amen I'll tell you something and it
[1:02:08] beats this finest Mama hen stuff
[1:02:11] how do we have to serve God how can we
[1:02:13] get mad how can we do this how can we
[1:02:16] hate the kids how can we do this it's
[1:02:18] just because you're dealing with Mama
[1:02:19] hand otherwise you're going to switch
[1:02:21] Let's Take a Ride let's see if God won't
[1:02:24] do something for us
[1:02:30] I believe that it is and I believe the
[1:02:32] thing of it is most people are not
[1:02:34] interested in bringing some of these
[1:02:36] people back to church but that's what we
[1:02:39] need
[1:02:40] and so as we see these things what a
[1:02:43] difference it comes to our life and it
[1:02:45] comes all the way back to Faith God help
[1:02:48] faith and virtue
[1:02:50] all of a sudden life begins to come into
[1:02:52] you and then the knowledge and the
[1:02:54] temperance and the patience and the
[1:02:56] godliness it begins to change your life
[1:02:59] I itemize those places but we'll just
[1:03:02] talk here just a moment
[1:03:04] but I thought about even you know the
[1:03:07] Lord
[1:03:09] you know he got a message from somebody
[1:03:13] and that was the woman that was a
[1:03:16] Samaritan
[1:03:18] and she wanted to meet God I don't know
[1:03:21] what she said or anything about her
[1:03:24] but he had a desire to get to Samaria
[1:03:28] is that right
[1:03:30] God Almighty came to town
[1:03:33] sent her his brothers and sisters after
[1:03:37] food
[1:03:38] while he stayed in town and hopes to
[1:03:41] talk
[1:03:42] to the lady that was going to be there
[1:03:45] shortly
[1:03:46] all of a sudden God showed up and he
[1:03:50] said give me a drink of your water
[1:03:53] she said don't you know that a Jew don't
[1:03:55] talk to a a man like me he said well he
[1:04:00] said sis if you knew who was talking to
[1:04:03] you
[1:04:07] if you knew who was talking to you
[1:04:09] tonight
[1:04:11] right now
[1:04:13] things would be different
[1:04:17] Jesus sat right there and talking to her
[1:04:19] and her life
[1:04:21] and the thing of it was is you look at
[1:04:24] that
[1:04:25] and I marked it to talk about but we'll
[1:04:27] pass it up
[1:04:29] but I that's what he came for she needed
[1:04:32] a Deliverance
[1:04:34] and she got her Deliverance
[1:04:37] amen she met God married six times
[1:04:43] and yet what did that have to do with
[1:04:45] God he dealt with her because of the
[1:04:47] needs she had in her life and had
[1:04:49] changed her life when I read it I
[1:04:51] thought about myself what
[1:04:54] that ought to take the very passage of
[1:04:57] that word
[1:04:58] and run your issues through life
[1:05:01] if God can take a woman that has been
[1:05:04] married six times living with a man
[1:05:08] shacking up with whatever
[1:05:10] and all of a sudden comes back and makes
[1:05:13] a statement and God Almighty comes back
[1:05:16] to her and said if you knew who was
[1:05:18] talking to you you'd ask of me I would
[1:05:21] give you water he said well how can you
[1:05:23] get water because it's so deep
[1:05:26] she had her reasons but I'll guarantee
[1:05:30] you a few moments with him it changed
[1:05:33] all that familiarology and the thing of
[1:05:36] it is it's the same power that Knights
[1:05:38] people today with our Behavior with God
[1:05:41] it's a God that still answers prayer to
[1:05:45] our lives
[1:05:47] and the thing of it was if you check it
[1:05:49] it washed her clean changed her life and
[1:05:53] I sat there and I looked I said do you
[1:05:56] mean to tell me that some gal married
[1:05:57] six times gonna make Heaven her home
[1:06:04] now we got people that won't even let
[1:06:07] one Mary down
[1:06:08] we got another one that some people do
[1:06:11] certain things and I'm just asking you
[1:06:13] have you invited the man in
[1:06:16] have you talked it over with God do we
[1:06:18] understand where who it is we're doing
[1:06:21] business with
[1:06:23] amen it's such a a wonderful sight to be
[1:06:27] able to see these things that God has
[1:06:30] done for us
[1:06:32] and the matters that he makes you look
[1:06:35] at that that super sense he said you
[1:06:38] were smart and he said I give you a
[1:06:40] sense
[1:06:42] but he said you got that when you were
[1:06:44] born
[1:06:45] how many of you know when you were born
[1:06:47] with that in that womb of your mama that
[1:06:51] you that child was a happy camper
[1:06:54] until she got her he got delivered when
[1:06:58] he got delivered out of Mom and Daddy he
[1:07:00] came up to a new world
[1:07:02] and now he's got a new things to deal
[1:07:06] with is that true the little child could
[1:07:09] have stayed in the womb of its Mama till
[1:07:12] whatever but when the time came she
[1:07:14] brought the child forth but when the
[1:07:16] child got out there all of a sudden it
[1:07:17] began to realize reality and friends I'm
[1:07:22] trying to bring our minds to a living
[1:07:25] reality of the things of God we stay up
[1:07:29] here sometimes so high when sometimes it
[1:07:32] would pay for you to come down here and
[1:07:34] start over again and come back up into
[1:07:36] Christ
[1:07:39] and understand the greatness of God and
[1:07:42] what God has made us to be what we are
[1:07:44] we may not be the greatest person in the
[1:07:47] world but if you come from him that's
[1:07:49] all it really matters
[1:07:52] and as we look at these scriptures
[1:07:56] and the quotes that he put out what a
[1:07:58] what an hour it is that God has brought
[1:08:02] it out
[1:08:03] and I got Marx I was going to quote him
[1:08:07] today about the statement and
[1:08:10] immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:08:12] behold the throne was set in heaven and
[1:08:14] once sat on the throne God begins to
[1:08:17] talk God begins to address personalities
[1:08:20] here in our life and I believe they
[1:08:23] become possible to you or I with our
[1:08:26] belief
[1:08:28] and I don't know how long we've been
[1:08:30] sat there we've got just a few more
[1:08:32] minutes
[1:08:33] but I got another one
[1:08:35] spiritual food
[1:08:39] into in due season
[1:08:44] you say well brother Patterson I'll tell
[1:08:46] you something I read this about 45 years
[1:08:49] ago
[1:08:51] now I don't know when the last time was
[1:08:52] I know what brother Ron's got books out
[1:08:55] in front
[1:08:56] and I don't know about all they are I
[1:08:58] got them all but I don't know where they
[1:09:00] all at I got them stacked away and
[1:09:04] but I got these and I got
[1:09:06] the promises here that God has set this
[1:09:09] for us
[1:09:10] and I began to read and I'm driving down
[1:09:13] or walking down and thinking about
[1:09:16] myself thinking about
[1:09:19] overcoming
[1:09:20] I want that
[1:09:22] I suffered from a stroke I suffer from
[1:09:25] certain things my speech isn't well
[1:09:28] I walk down the thing and I see that
[1:09:30] what God's telling me and what God's
[1:09:32] bringing into me
[1:09:34] and now all of a sudden I began to
[1:09:36] realize spiritual food into season
[1:09:40] when was the last time you had a nice
[1:09:44] dinner
[1:09:46] and I mean but it might have really
[1:09:51] everybody likes steak
[1:09:53] everybody likes this
[1:09:56] but he reminds you several things in
[1:09:58] here like I said that
[1:10:00] he reminds you of
[1:10:03] what he put on you and what he gave you
[1:10:06] when you were born your sight you're
[1:10:08] hearing in this but I also put on a
[1:10:11] supernatural presence that brings you in
[1:10:15] time with me
[1:10:16] and I say thank you Jesus because with
[1:10:19] that I got control over this I got
[1:10:22] control over this I got control
[1:10:24] everything in my life but I think about
[1:10:26] this I mean how many people want to hear
[1:10:29] spiritual food in due season
[1:10:33] okay we're going to talk about maybe uh
[1:10:36] when we're going to preach about this
[1:10:39] well it's out of season okay
[1:10:42] maybe we're going to talk about what God
[1:10:44] did to the woman at the well
[1:10:47] maybe we're going to talk about people
[1:10:50] that
[1:10:51] serve him and have a fountain to drink
[1:10:53] from instead of a glass of water
[1:10:56] how many of you drink from a fountain
[1:11:01] it's for real
[1:11:03] compared to what else and a lot of
[1:11:06] people drink it somewhere else and they
[1:11:07] get a knowledge from someone else
[1:11:10] but the thing of it is as we look at the
[1:11:12] word of God spiritual food undue season
[1:11:16] and you say well brother Patterson go
[1:11:18] ahead and let it let it be said okay
[1:11:22] let me just read you a little bit can I
[1:11:25] eight minutes colored in green some of
[1:11:27] it some of it's colored in Brown
[1:11:29] some of it I have to color and something
[1:11:31] else because they go back and color it
[1:11:34] and sometimes I read it crazy
[1:11:38] I read it so fast they just go right
[1:11:40] over it
[1:11:41] I thought about these things what a
[1:11:44] difference it makes an angel come down
[1:11:46] which was the same kind
[1:11:49] put him in the sleep again feeding a
[1:11:52] little guy and woke him up and he had
[1:11:55] more meal cakes
[1:11:58] bake for him and he went in the strength
[1:12:01] of the case for 40 days now this was
[1:12:04] Elijah and this was the thing that
[1:12:06] Elijah put forth and the ministry that
[1:12:09] he had if you want to understand what he
[1:12:12] did to that little woman that raised him
[1:12:14] and how he laid uh eating pills dwelling
[1:12:18] by himself waiting for a rain to start
[1:12:22] up waiting for the rains to fall and he
[1:12:25] waited and finally one day he went to
[1:12:28] see him then there's always a lesson
[1:12:30] Behind these things there is one coming
[1:12:32] there are issues that's going on there
[1:12:36] are problems that we need to know
[1:12:42] why is it that the message don't go out
[1:12:46] with the great big places
[1:12:50] you know you talk about a church you'll
[1:12:52] they'll go along they'll do a lot to
[1:12:54] hear it but when it talks to God it
[1:12:58] becomes different
[1:13:00] and I think what I'll do is I'll pass up
[1:13:02] the reading of this because
[1:13:04] I can't read too good
[1:13:07] truly the Lord his food was to do the
[1:13:10] will of God
[1:13:12] to see works of God made manifest in
[1:13:16] this hour
[1:13:18] can I ask you a question how many of you
[1:13:20] see
[1:13:21] manifested things relative in this hour
[1:13:27] I don't know where it starts
[1:13:29] and I don't know where it finishes
[1:13:34] but I'll guarantee you what
[1:13:37] you begin to pass the word around he
[1:13:39] begins to talk
[1:13:41] some people a big move of God because
[1:13:46] they're having a party at the church
[1:13:49] and they might say to themselves well
[1:13:51] maybe we need something greater than a
[1:13:54] party
[1:13:55] maybe we need to meet God
[1:13:58] I say that to myself
[1:14:00] if we begin to look around to a lot of
[1:14:02] issues that we have and dated it was
[1:14:05] what man has got rather than what God
[1:14:07] has got and I don't mean to be critical
[1:14:09] but I'm just talking to you how many of
[1:14:12] you believe what I'm telling you
[1:14:15] and that's a few of you
[1:14:20] but the thing of it is
[1:14:23] my brothers and sisters what a great
[1:14:25] hour it is that God has brought us to
[1:14:28] this hour that we live in
[1:14:30] and to make us exactly what we have
[1:14:32] ought to be because we're going to meet
[1:14:34] him one of these days
[1:14:37] amen a lot of things that we call Church
[1:14:40] people go to church people don't depend
[1:14:43] on what they hear to change their lives
[1:14:45] and all I want to see is what God has
[1:14:48] for us if God said it I believe it I
[1:14:52] want to follow the walk I want to do
[1:14:55] what he said greater is he for you or I
[1:14:58] than anything else in this world people
[1:15:00] say to me well I'd like to hear
[1:15:02] something greater than let us pick up
[1:15:04] another book and we'll read let's talk
[1:15:08] about that woman that that that that
[1:15:10] that uh
[1:15:13] I'm sorry that Berg and how she called
[1:15:17] that young man to rise up and she did it
[1:15:20] through a jump and she raised him up and
[1:15:22] took him for a run and would changed his
[1:15:25] whole life and what a life that he had
[1:15:27] and that we made over here to the Statue
[1:15:31] of a perfect man then we move over here
[1:15:34] to church ages and then we move over
[1:15:36] here to the things it's got to say a
[1:15:39] super sense
[1:15:41] and the things that we're looking at
[1:15:43] this morning may the power and grace of
[1:15:46] God fill your hearts and Minds
[1:15:49] he's coming soon
[1:15:51] friends how can we continue to say that
[1:15:54] and not believe that
[1:15:57] and are you ready am I ready
[1:16:01] are you ready and a lot of things that
[1:16:04] we Dibble and Dabble in the world we
[1:16:08] may not give God our total amount
[1:16:11] and we look at things and we begin to
[1:16:14] consider things I want what he wants I
[1:16:18] want the statue of a perfect man I want
[1:16:20] the secrets I want the promises I want
[1:16:24] to know everything that God's got for us
[1:16:26] may the Lord bless you today
[1:16:30] and all I can tell you is that through
[1:16:33] prayer and dedication
[1:16:35] you're going to get a good look at
[1:16:36] yourself
[1:16:37] I look at myself
[1:16:40] and I have to say dear God I need more
[1:16:43] of you
[1:16:44] amen I need what you would have I don't
[1:16:47] know what all you would say
[1:16:49] they say do you have faith I got to be
[1:16:51] honest that's a small word
[1:16:55] but you see when you got faith and
[1:16:57] you're using it you got faith but when
[1:17:00] faith is not being used I think people
[1:17:03] ought to really be able to touch God for
[1:17:05] faith
[1:17:07] and if they can't they get virtue and if
[1:17:09] they can't get virtue they get
[1:17:10] Temperance if they can't get that they
[1:17:12] just keep moving up eventually
[1:17:15] God begins to deal with them
[1:17:18] and I think it is that if we love God if
[1:17:22] what we ought to what a difference it
[1:17:24] would begin to make in our heart and
[1:17:26] life
[1:17:27] could we have the music player now I
[1:17:29] guess it's about time is that what they
[1:17:31] do about they don't didn't deny
[1:17:36] I could keep on going I really did want
[1:17:39] to bring some of these statements to you
[1:17:42] on temperance
[1:17:46] and I you know I I people sometimes say
[1:17:49] Michael you're just good that's just
[1:17:52] but you know sometimes I have to tell
[1:17:54] them who I am
[1:17:56] I'm not the happiest guy in the world at
[1:17:58] times and yet the fourth thing was
[1:18:00] temperance
[1:18:02] you hide your temperance
[1:18:04] some people got mad at church some
[1:18:06] people get mad at this Saturday or the
[1:18:08] other friends but what it is it's
[1:18:11] I'm interested in my calling
[1:18:14] amen I want to be able to climb this
[1:18:17] mountain through faith to every
[1:18:20] expression that there is I want to get
[1:18:23] up there to where the love of God abides
[1:18:25] in our life
[1:18:27] amen I want his eagle
[1:18:29] to feel the power of inspiration to fly
[1:18:33] I want to realize what my Lord and
[1:18:36] Savior did with that woman in Samaria
[1:18:40] I want how he changed his life
[1:18:43] and I want you to know how that when God
[1:18:46] did certain things he left it up to you
[1:18:49] to find out if it was accomplished
[1:18:52] and some people don't accomplish it they
[1:18:54] don't know that it will accomplish it if
[1:18:57] God did it let us do it
[1:18:59] and it ought to be that we're in our
[1:19:01] life
[1:19:02] and may God help us to see these things
[1:19:06] that God has for us
[1:19:07] [Music]
[1:19:09] trying to develop us
[1:19:12] I hear as a preacher preachers talking
[1:19:14] about a rapture
[1:19:18] and I have to look around I say God am I
[1:19:20] ready
[1:19:22] is so and so ready is my brother ready
[1:19:25] is my sister ready
[1:19:28] and that's what we want
[1:19:30] want seek power how many of you like to
[1:19:32] see people healed
[1:19:34] could I ask you a question how many of
[1:19:36] you ever take that really to Heart
[1:19:40] and the thing of it is
[1:19:42] get alone somewhere with God and you
[1:19:45] stay there until you finally touch home
[1:19:48] with God
[1:19:50] you say well I I spent about three
[1:19:53] minutes and maybe once every month to
[1:19:55] talk about it
[1:19:57] and I think it ought to
[1:19:59] in my own life
[1:20:01] there's something inside me says I want
[1:20:04] something in here that will push this
[1:20:06] thing
[1:20:07] I want something in here that'll bring
[1:20:09] Jesus Christ on the scene I want to see
[1:20:12] him heal the sick and raise the Dead I
[1:20:15] want him to see something to people's
[1:20:16] lives how many of you believe that God's
[1:20:19] able to do great and powerful issues
[1:20:24] friends if you believe that and you
[1:20:26] really hone down on it it really ought
[1:20:29] to change lives
[1:20:31] amen but if you don't believe that's
[1:20:34] something else and I believe what we do
[1:20:36] we do believe the things that God has
[1:20:38] for us
[1:20:39] and may we go on to be more like him
[1:20:43] and pick up that super sense
[1:20:46] want to be like him
[1:20:48] amen I want everything I do I want to
[1:20:51] I'm not trying to please man trying to
[1:20:53] please God
[1:20:55] I know a lot of times in our life we got
[1:20:57] heartaches we got issues
[1:21:00] I got him in my own life and all of a
[1:21:02] sudden when you begin to talk to God I
[1:21:05] want to know who I am
[1:21:07] I want to know the power of those
[1:21:10] things that we got here I want to tell
[1:21:12] you I called the man
[1:21:15] I couldn't get that thing to work
[1:21:18] and I got the man here and now it works
[1:21:22] and you know I listen sometimes to
[1:21:24] different preachers or whatever I wonder
[1:21:27] just how close people are
[1:21:30] because I want to know what they're
[1:21:31] doing you see you're just picking I want
[1:21:34] to hear it
[1:21:35] this is the way walking in it followed
[1:21:38] Christ that's what I want tell me how do
[1:21:42] you speak in tongues do you get close to
[1:21:45] God what it is that you do or I do
[1:21:49] God knows
[1:21:51] and the coming of the Lord is at hand I
[1:21:53] want to be ready
[1:21:54] I want to be ready amen I want to see
[1:21:58] things changed I want to see my life
[1:22:00] every bit just like him when he said
[1:22:03] Michael as yes sir here I am
[1:22:06] amen when he says I want you to come out
[1:22:08] here I want you know I heard brother
[1:22:10] Brandon talk I'm sorry to go back again
[1:22:15] but he says you know I got a call from a
[1:22:17] young man that
[1:22:18] got drunk drank all his life
[1:22:22] turned in he had cancer every part of
[1:22:26] his body had cancer
[1:22:28] on the incoming Blood on the kidneys or
[1:22:30] everything he had it had blood
[1:22:33] and cancer
[1:22:35] his mama said sir could you go see him
[1:22:39] and so he decides he'd go down to the
[1:22:41] hospital to see him loaded with cancer
[1:22:44] and the thing of it was is that he
[1:22:48] prayed for him
[1:22:49] two of his friends was everybody said
[1:22:51] bow your head let's pray he said he
[1:22:53] prayed for him and the next morning the
[1:22:56] child was up and made well under the
[1:22:59] power of God
[1:23:01] and I say Lord did it take a prophet
[1:23:04] or could it be
[1:23:07] someone like me
[1:23:09] do you ever feel like you're you're
[1:23:11] maybe a little bit of a prophet
[1:23:15] nobody
[1:23:16] how many of you feel like you're
[1:23:18] anointed that whatever you might ask it
[1:23:20] might change
[1:23:22] now we're talking
[1:23:24] so you begin to feel that maybe you've
[1:23:25] got a power and a presence
[1:23:28] and everything that brother Branham
[1:23:30] would go to there'd be he had touched
[1:23:32] them or he'd pray for him and God would
[1:23:34] heal them
[1:23:36] and the thing of it is I have to say God
[1:23:40] that is a lesson to us we ought to do
[1:23:42] those self-same things in our life I'm
[1:23:45] not here to be critical I'm here to tell
[1:23:47] you greater is he that's in you
[1:23:50] greater is he that's in you
[1:23:53] greater is he that's in you greater is
[1:23:56] he that's in you
[1:23:58] than he that's in the world
[1:24:01] how many of you believe that
[1:24:03] then take a look at it
[1:24:06] looks pretty good don't it
[1:24:08] he belongs to me I belong to him I'm his
[1:24:14] he's mine
[1:24:16] I'm going to treat him different I'm
[1:24:19] going to believe him different
[1:24:21] things change and I believe that's the
[1:24:23] hour that we're coming
[1:24:25] amen and that's what God made us to be
[1:24:27] let us stand and let us sing our chorus
