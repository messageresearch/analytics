[34:09] strong and uh like every morning I wake
[34:12] up and it's been ringing in me years
[34:15] and couple weeks ago believe it was a
[34:17] Wednesday night I believe brother Warren
[34:19] was preaching about the blood and I
[34:20] think so many times we forget about
[34:22] that you know was reading my Bible in
[34:26] Exodus 13 where Moses told told the
[34:27] children he said don't
[34:30] forget he said but remember always what
[34:33] you've been delivered from this night
[34:36] right what God has done CU we know
[34:39] brother Braham taught us without the
[34:40] token
[34:41] right there's no way we can escape the
[34:45] death
[34:45] angel so I'm thankful for a father
[34:49] Hallelujah that cared enough about
[34:53] me that he made sure that blood was on
[34:55] the doorposts
[34:58] and then our responsibility is to get
[34:59] under that
[35:01] huh the next evening was listen to a
[35:03] tape at the house and where R speak to
[35:06] the Rock 1953 and he tells this story
[35:09] and this I don't know who wrote the song
[35:11] or the brother Brenham preached it first
[35:13] 1953 I don't know where it come which
[35:15] come first but the words in this song
[35:18] goes right along with what he was
[35:19] talking
[35:21] [Music]
[35:23] about one dark night in Egypt
[35:29] a fearful time had
[35:33] come for one little Hebrew
[35:38] boy who was his
[35:40] father's firstborn
[35:43] son with the angel of death passing low
[35:50] it was hard to fall
[35:54] asleep but one little lamb
[35:58] lay in his mind while he lay there
[36:03] counting
[36:07] sheep he wondered why the young lamb had
[36:12] to die why his blood was on the
[36:18] door through the wind and rain it still
[36:23] remain but he
[36:25] wanted to be
[36:28] sure so he called out to his Earthly
[36:34] father with a trembling voice so
[36:39] scared crying father will you please
[36:43] look and see if the
[36:46] blood is still
[36:51] there and he said Son now don't you
[36:57] worry
[36:58] for the blood is there to
[37:03] stay the wind May blow and the rain may
[37:09] fall but it won't just wash
[37:13] away all the blood will stand the raging
[37:19] Storm then apply with love and
[37:24] care so stay secure here you can rest
[37:30] assur that the
[37:32] blood is still
[37:37] there now looking over all the
[37:43] damage Satan's storms have left
[37:49] behind a flood of endless
[37:53] questions and sometimes doubt has f
[37:57] filled my
[37:58] mind oh but the fear that g my troubled
[38:04] soul it brings me back to my knees in
[38:09] prayer crying father will you please
[38:13] look and see if the blood is still there
[38:20] and this is what he
[38:21] says and he said Son now don't you worry
[38:28] but the blood is there to
[38:33] stay all the wind May blow and the rain
[38:38] may fall but it won't just wash
[38:43] away well the blood will stand the
[38:47] raging Storm it's been applied with love
[38:52] and
[38:54] care so stay secure you can rest assured
[39:00] that the blood is still
[39:06] there and he said Son now don't you
[39:12] worry or the blood is there to
[39:17] stay for the wind May blow and the rain
[39:22] may fall but it won't just wash away
[39:28] you see the blood will stand the raging

[43:09] just want to take every chance I can to
[43:12] let him know how much I appreciate what
[43:13] he's done for me and just before we uh
[43:17] we sing this song A few years ago in in
[43:20] going through the seal books there was
[43:22] something that struck me at the end of
[43:24] every one of the seals we always thank
[43:26] brother brandom theme song was only
[43:28] believe but at the end of every one of
[43:30] the seals there was a song that he sang
[43:33] I love him because he first loved me and
[43:37] he purchased my salvation on calvary's
[43:40] tree and so right after he's telling us
[43:43] pray for Revelation there's nothing
[43:45] greater we can pray for he reminds us he
[43:48] did this for
[43:49] you on an Old Rugged
[43:52] Cross a small Lonely Hill called
[43:55] golgatha
[43:57] just never want to forget what he did
[43:58] for
[44:00] us on that small Lonely
[44:04] [Music]
[44:09] Hill in the
[44:12] beginning God stood in the Stillness and
[44:15] he spoke his creative
[44:17] words let there be light
[44:21] [Music]
[44:36] in the beginning God stood in the
[44:38] Stillness he spoke his creative
[44:42] words let there be
[44:45] light and let the heavens
[44:48] appear he made the
[44:50] oceans the Seas and the
[44:53] Earth and with his mighty hand he
[44:55] scooped out the canyon
[44:58] with his fingers he traced courses for
[45:01] the
[45:02] rivers he made the mountains to stand
[45:05] tall and
[45:07] still but then a slight trace of
[45:10] sadness came into his
[45:13] eyes as he
[45:16] made a
[45:18] small lonely
[45:23] H well then he said
[45:27] let us make
[45:29] man in
[45:31] our own
[45:34] image and give
[45:37] him
[45:39] dominion over
[45:44] all we will
[45:47] walk
[45:49] together in the
[45:51] cool of the
[45:54] evening I'll help him
[45:58] if he should
[46:03] fall oh but I
[46:06] want him to love
[46:09] me
[46:11] because he really wants
[46:14] to to
[46:16] walk with me by his own
[46:22] way but then a
[46:25] slight trace of
[46:28] sadness came back into his
[46:33] eyes as he
[46:35] looked toward that
[46:37] small Lonely
[46:42] Hill then

[1:00:23] morning you know David
[1:00:26] was
[1:00:29] wondering because Nathan the prophet had
[1:00:32] been speaking all of these Supernatural
[1:00:35] things you wonder how many
[1:00:38] sermons how many things did he hear how
[1:00:41] many Visions did Nathan
[1:00:43] speak and I want you to understand that
[1:00:45] from the time of the
[1:00:47] anointing of
[1:00:49] Samuel to David when he was just a
[1:00:52] little Shepherd
[1:00:54] boy the battle
[1:01:00] began he kept thinking my what is all of
[1:01:04] this about I'm going to be anointed to
[1:01:06] be king over Israel but you all know it
[1:01:09] took well over 20 years before from the
[1:01:11] time of the anointing until he became
[1:01:13] king and even when he was King and
[1:01:16] during his kingship and while he was
[1:01:18] dying even his sons and different ones
[1:01:21] were trying to take his
[1:01:22] position ain't nothing easy Saints
[1:01:29] no matter how much God is with you you
[1:01:32] will go through things but guess what
[1:01:36] Jesus
[1:01:37] said I have prayed for you that you
[1:01:40] might
[1:01:41] overcome Hallelujah you are more than
[1:01:46] Overcomers in John chapter 3 couple more
[1:01:49] scriptures here John 3: 12 and
[1:01:54] 13 if I have told told you Earthly
[1:01:56] things and you believe
[1:01:58] not how shall you believe if I tell you
[1:02:01] of heavenly
[1:02:04] things and no man hath ascended up to
[1:02:08] heaven but he that came down from heaven

[1:02:15] declaration remember brother Brenham got
[1:02:18] a sermon from a cigarette
[1:02:21] pack he said I ain't going to pick that
[1:02:24] up the Lord said I tell you go back and

[1:02:57] before no
[1:03:00] deposit no
[1:03:03] return no man hath ascended up into
[1:03:08] heaven but he that came
[1:03:11] down from heaven what kind of a person
[1:03:14] does that make
[1:03:18] you John 14: 16- 21 I pray the
[1:03:23] father he shall give you another comfort
[1:03:26] that he may abide with you

[1:05:00] him may God bless the reading of his
[1:05:03] word thank you
[1:05:06] Lord I'd like to title my sermon this
[1:05:09] morning who I
[1:05:13] am I'd like to take a subject of
[1:05:15] identifying the real you
[1:05:21] amen
[1:05:24] now you sit here so nicely this
[1:05:27] morning we recognize
[1:05:30] you because of this outward appearance
[1:05:33] that you have but that's not the real
[1:05:36] you in fact this real you is going to be
[1:05:39] subject to age and circumstances and
[1:05:44] things and failures and
[1:05:47] faults but that ain't
[1:05:49] you
[1:05:51] hallelujah amen it's not you
[1:05:55] the real you is on the inside and I want
[1:05:57] to talk about that
[1:06:00] identifying the real
[1:06:03] you I started out last week with the
[1:06:06] question who am
[1:06:08] I today I wish to change it to a
[1:06:13] declaration who I
[1:06:17] am you see because identity comes from
[1:06:22] your heavenly
[1:06:24] father amen and as we all know right now
[1:06:27] the world is in an identity
[1:06:30] crisis some of you may be in an identity
[1:06:33] crisis also just because you're raised
[1:06:36] around this message or raised in a
[1:06:39] church doesn't mean you know your
[1:06:42] identity every man's got to work out his
[1:06:44] own salvation with fear and trembling
[1:06:46] you need to know who you
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:49] are that's
[1:06:52] right many in the world don't know
[1:06:55] whether they're male or
[1:06:59] female some of them don't know if
[1:07:01] they're human or
[1:07:02] animal these are in your news and in
[1:07:05] your media and then the schools have to
[1:07:07] try to provide for
[1:07:10] this oh my what is it it's eating from
[1:07:13] the Tree of
[1:07:16] knowledge and it's just becoming so
[1:07:18] perverted and we know
[1:07:20] that now your true identity begins say
[1:07:24] the word begins
[1:07:26] that's when it begins when you are born
[1:07:29] again of the spirit of God because
[1:07:31] except a man be born again he is void of
[1:07:35] the spiritual things of God because he
[1:07:37] is carnally minded and it is enity with
[1:07:40] God and neither can you know God so the
[1:07:46] beginning of the knowledge of
[1:07:50] God is your identity
[1:07:56] because you will never know who you are
[1:07:59] until you know who he
[1:08:02] is but when you know who he
[1:08:05] is you will know who you
[1:08:09] are I am what I am because of the I
[1:08:22] am and as you begin through this new
[1:08:26] birth we are told in the scriptures and
[1:08:29] even the Apostle Paul said when you were
[1:08:31] a child you thought as a child acted
[1:08:33] like a child and you spake as a child
[1:08:36] but when you became a man you put away a
[1:08:39] childish things we know even as Paul
[1:08:42] told the the early churches oh you are
[1:08:44] still babes in
[1:08:46] Christ still having need of the sincere
[1:08:50] milk of the word rather than solid
[1:08:53] spiritual meat that is induced
[1:08:57] season but you've got to grow you've got
[1:09:00] to mature your maturing has got to be
[1:09:03] also in the mind and in spiritual
[1:09:06] conditions you've got to begun to start
[1:09:09] Discerning who you are amen quit
[1:09:12] Discerning everybody else and looking at
[1:09:14] them how critical we are to look at
[1:09:18] others and we see a moat in our
[1:09:20] brother's eye and fail to see the log in
[1:09:23] her own
[1:09:27] when there was a change of ministry with
[1:09:29] the Lord Jesus and he began to say
[1:09:32] except you eat of My Flesh and drink of
[1:09:34] my blood the Bible says in St John 6 and
[1:09:38] verse 60 there are many for of his
[1:09:42] disciples when they heard this said this
[1:09:45] is a hard saying who can hear
[1:09:49] it and when Jesus knew in himself that
[1:09:52] the disciples murmured at it he said on
[1:09:56] them does this third pole offend
[1:10:03] you because the third pole unlike the
[1:10:06] first two is
[1:10:10] offensive it's a
[1:10:14] separating it even divides between the
[1:10:18] spirit and
[1:10:22] soul and what if you shall see the son
[1:10:25] of man Ascend up where he was before he
[1:10:29] gave him a little bit more spiritual
[1:10:31] something for them to think about if
[1:10:32] you're hanging on the edge of the cliff
[1:10:34] he's going to push you over
[1:10:37] yeah it is the spirit that quickeneth
[1:10:40] and the flesh profiteth nothing the
[1:10:42] words I speak unto you they are spirit
[1:10:45] and they are
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:10:48] life and there are some of you that
[1:10:50] believe not for Jesus knew from the
[1:10:53] beginning who they were that believe not
[1:10:56] and who should betray him and he said
[1:10:59] therefore I said unto you that no man
[1:11:01] can come unto me except it were given
[1:11:04] unto him of my
[1:11:07] father this coming is
[1:11:12] exclusive not everyone can come and
[1:11:15] Jesus makes it very clear so if you feel
[1:11:21] a bidding a wooing of the Holy Spirit to
[1:11:24] come if there's something inside of you
[1:11:27] that this message is drawing you come
[1:11:31] then let me tell you it's not to make
[1:11:34] you puffed up it's not to make you
[1:11:37] arrogant but when you see the grace of
[1:11:40] God you bow your head and say oh Father
[1:11:43] who am I
[1:11:56] verse 65 therefore I said unto you that
[1:11:59] no man can come unto me except to were
[1:12:01] given to unto him and my father from
[1:12:03] that
[1:12:05] time many of his disciples went back and
[1:12:08] walked no more with him then said Jesus
[1:12:11] under the
[1:12:13] 12 will
[1:12:16] ye also go away
[1:12:21] right then Simon Peter and answer him
[1:12:23] Lord To Whom Shall we go thou Hast the
[1:12:27] words of eternal life and we believe and
[1:12:29] are sure Thou Art the
[1:12:31] Christ the son of the Living God Jesus
[1:12:35] answered and said have I have not I
[1:12:37] chosen you
[1:12:40] 12 and one of you is a devil I want you
[1:12:44] to understand that even in this choosing
[1:12:46] among the
[1:12:48] message God chose Devils to be among
[1:12:53] us to betray him
[1:12:58] to say all manner of evil against it to
[1:13:02] rise
[1:13:03] up and to betray him with a judian
[1:13:08] kiss have not I chosen all of you one of
[1:13:13] you is a
[1:13:15] devil it's amazing he spake of Judas the
[1:13:19] scariot the son of
[1:13:23] Simon for he it was that should betray
[1:13:26] him being one of the
[1:13:30] 12 now brother Brenham as I began to now
[1:13:35] may I just kind of share from my heart
[1:13:37] and bless my heart my wife sent me a
[1:13:39] note this
[1:13:41] morning I got a text just before I come

[1:15:18] time in
[1:15:20] 1963 there is not a person living but
[1:15:22] would like to look past the time the
[1:15:25] curtain where did I come

[1:15:31] I and where am I
[1:15:34] going of all the fine books that's been
[1:15:37] read the Great Master of selections
[1:15:40] that's been made there's only one book
[1:15:42] that reveals who you
[1:15:44] are where you come
[1:15:46] from and where you're
[1:15:48] going that's it that's it and it it also
[1:15:52] let us look past the curtain to see it
[1:15:56] amen but you were born a baby immature
[1:15:59] in your thoughts in fact you were born
[1:16:01] with
[1:16:02] amnesia a very terrible case of Amnesia
[1:16:06] you had no idea of your
[1:16:10] identity you were a baby immature had
[1:16:13] immature thoughts carnal raised up C
[1:16:18] taste smell feel here you're trying to
[1:16:21] figure out all of this world around you
[1:16:24] and ever since you came out of your
[1:16:26] mother's womb you've been slapped and
[1:16:28] persecuted and and prodded and pinched
[1:16:32] and all kinds of things and a man that's
[1:16:34] born of a woman is full of trouble and
[1:16:38] lots of Sorrows can you say
[1:16:40] amen yeah look at your
[1:16:43] life it ain't been
[1:16:47] easy you're born a sinner for all have
[1:16:51] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:16:52] God and the wages of sin is death
[1:16:56] but the gift of God is eternal life
[1:16:58] through Jesus
[1:17:04] Christ you were born with
[1:17:07] it
[1:17:10] Amnesia unbelief a cloud of unbelief
[1:17:12] hanging over
[1:17:15] you and yet in that dirt bag of humanity
[1:17:20] that surrounds that elect seed if you
[1:17:22] are a seed
[1:17:25] that little dirt bag is going to bother
[1:17:27] you the rest of your life even the
[1:17:31] Apostle Paul said oh Wretched Man that I
[1:17:33] am who shall deliver
[1:17:35] me amen thank you Lord from These Bars
[1:17:39] of Bones that's
[1:17:42] right your worst enemy is the one you
[1:17:45] brush his teeth and look at his face
[1:17:48] every
[1:17:49] morning Paul said I've got to Die daily
[1:17:52] I got to crucify the flesh that Christ
[1:17:54] might live
[1:17:57] the prophet preached only one time only
[1:17:59] one sermon on spiritual Amnesia he never
[1:18:03] preaches it a second time it's one of
[1:18:05] those sermons that wow it's amazing but
[1:18:09] he uses the word Amnesia 28
[1:18:14] times in an hour and a half of a sermon
[1:18:17] he preaches and talks about this Amnesia
[1:18:21] this disease that has affected people
[1:18:25] and he says and then he likes it I
[1:18:27] always love how brother Brenham takes as
[1:18:29] it was so it
[1:18:32] is so he allows us to take a good look
[1:18:36] at ourselves I
[1:18:38] wonder do I have
[1:18:41] amnesia how bad is my
[1:18:44] case I don't know I I I
[1:18:49] forgot
[1:18:51] Amnesia so brother Brandon preaches
[1:18:54] spiritual amnes let's look into it and
[1:18:56] let this diagnosis come from the prophet
[1:18:59] as he begins to under the spirit of God
[1:19:02] lay it out now this Amnesia we're told
[1:19:05] is could cause you to be a place where
[1:19:08] you cannot identify
[1:19:11] yourself now it's an unusual thing it
[1:19:15] don't happen too often but the cause is
[1:19:20] from
[1:19:22] shock it's somebody that don't even know
[1:19:25] who they
[1:19:26] are you find it comes from
[1:19:30] Wars sometimes soldiers get
[1:19:33] it sometimes people get
[1:19:36] it another thing causes it is
[1:19:42] worry
[1:19:44] worry worry fear fear hath
[1:19:50] torment worry will cause it wow that's
[1:19:53] an amazing thing just worry yeah will
[1:19:58] cause you to have amnesia some of you
[1:20:01] worry so much about what tomorrow will
[1:20:03] be and how it's going to be and what
[1:20:06] will be the change of the body and are
[1:20:08] you sure I'm one of them and what about
[1:20:10] the blood is it really there daddy are
[1:20:12] you
[1:20:13] sure the death angel will pass over me
[1:20:16] you
[1:20:17] worry you worry so much about crossing
[1:20:21] the bridge and you may never cross that
[1:20:23] bridge
[1:20:25] why worry just have
[1:20:29] faith so now he's he's diagnosing a case
[1:20:33] of Amnesia not knowing who you
[1:20:36] are comes from a
[1:20:38] shock I had a friend of mine playing
[1:20:41] varsity football and
[1:20:44] man he he hit heads with a defensive
[1:20:47] lineman or whatever and these guys two
[1:20:50] hit helmets and boy they both fell down
[1:20:53] and it knocked him unconscious
[1:20:55] and for 3 days my friend who I knew he
[1:20:59] came to school didn't even know where he
[1:21:01] was at they had to assign him another
[1:21:05] student to take him to class and he
[1:21:07] didn't recognize anybody after you know
[1:21:10] I thought he was joking I come on
[1:21:13] Jim stop it buddy what's wrong with you
[1:21:16] you know me your old
[1:21:18] buddy I don't know
[1:21:20] you it can caused by a shock or by too
[1:21:24] much worry brother brm picks it up let's
[1:21:27] go on a little further so worry has no
[1:21:29] virtue to it at all but faith has all
[1:21:33] virtue believe no now
[1:21:37] worry sometimes causes it and another
[1:21:41] thing that caus it among the people is
[1:21:44] getting between two
[1:21:46] opinions
[1:21:48] wow that'll cause
[1:21:51] Amnesia getting on the Internet
[1:21:54] and getting between a dozen
[1:21:57] opinions well what's this preacher think
[1:21:59] about this what that guy think about it
[1:22:01] what does this one say about who cares
[1:22:04] I'll tell you what quit going on to the
[1:22:06] internet and I do agree with this press
[1:22:12] play
[1:22:15] hallu but that doesn't replace
[1:22:18] church that I do believe saints of God
[1:22:21] that many of you are not at home pray
[1:22:24] press and play like you should so that
[1:22:27] you might hear the voice of God you
[1:22:28] might hear what the seventh Angels said
[1:22:32] so when you come to church you can say
[1:22:34] Amen yes sir brother Ron I read that
[1:22:43] yesterday that'll cause
[1:22:45] Amnesia and it gets you to a place where
[1:22:48] you actually who what you done you've
[1:22:50] lost your
[1:22:51] reasons you lost your mind
[1:22:55] you don't know who you are you can't
[1:22:57] identify yourself that's where a lot of
[1:23:00] young people get out here and they get
[1:23:01] to surfing the internet next thing you
[1:23:05] know you get your halted between all
[1:23:06] these different opinion and guess what
[1:23:09] you get
[1:23:10] amnesia can identify who you
[1:23:16] are see Prophet said three things will
[1:23:19] cause Amnesia shock worry and halted
[1:23:23] between two opinions
[1:23:25] you know you cannot come to your
[1:23:27] spiritual
[1:23:29] adoption and your placing within the
[1:23:32] body of Christ to know who you
[1:23:36] are until you know who you
[1:23:41] are that's big you can talk about oh
[1:23:44] well I know him he's my Lord my savior
[1:23:47] he's my king he you know I heard about
[1:23:50] this and I heard that and I heard his
[1:23:51] doctrines and everything but when you
[1:23:54] have him revealed to
[1:23:58] you
[1:24:00] from him
[1:24:03] personally then you begin to realize who
[1:24:05] you
[1:24:09] are see the Bible says that a
[1:24:12] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[1:24:18] ways he said there's no black white bird
[1:24:25] there no Christian
[1:24:28] non-Christian God doesn't want you to be
[1:24:30] a
[1:24:33] chamelea he doesn't want you to be that
[1:24:36] kind of lizard well when I'm with a
[1:24:38] bunch of unbelievers I I act like them
[1:24:40] but when I'm with Christians I change my
[1:24:42] color oh look at me I I I'll throw a
[1:24:44] quote out once in a while I I heard
[1:24:46] brother bandam say to make people think
[1:24:48] you're
[1:24:51] spiritual God help us
[1:24:56] it's not just knowing who God is but
[1:24:59] it's knowing who you
[1:25:05] are it's not just confessing that you
[1:25:08] know him right because there will be
[1:25:11] many that come unto him in that day and
[1:25:14] say Lord Lord did not we do this did not
[1:25:17] we do that signs wonders all of this and
[1:25:20] he said depart from me you workers of
[1:25:22] iniquity I never never knew you janesco
[1:25:27] means I never conceived you you're not
[1:25:31] my conception you're not my Offspring
[1:25:33] amen because if you
[1:25:36] were you would hear my
[1:25:38] word it wouldn't offend you oh it might
[1:25:42] slap
[1:25:44] you it might shake your
[1:25:48] tree it'll never offend you because
[1:25:52] where could we go
[1:25:54] amen let me tell you I I remember just
[1:25:57] coming to this message young
[1:25:59] boy long-haired kid
[1:26:02] Surfer California
[1:26:05] hippie and every
[1:26:10] tape there was something
[1:26:12] new and you young men with your long
[1:26:15] hair it's a perversion oh man did he
[1:26:19] have to say that just tell the women not
[1:26:22] to cut their hair why do you got to get
[1:26:24] on the
[1:26:25] guys well it is it's
[1:26:28] wrong and brother brm said watch the two
[1:26:30] spirits in the end time he said man will
[1:26:33] grow his hair like a woman and a woman
[1:26:36] will cut her hair
[1:26:37] off because she dishonors her
[1:26:42] head but Hey listen the word of God is a
[1:26:45] sharp two-edged
[1:26:46] sword and when we come to church we're
[1:26:49] not here to see how good we are we're
[1:26:52] here to see huh let's have a pet scan
[1:26:55] let's have an MRI let's let's have a CAT
[1:26:58] scan let's do something man let's have
[1:27:00] the word of God look over every one of
[1:27:02] you oh oh man I see something I see a
[1:27:07] lump I see a
[1:27:09] growth I see something
[1:27:21] there for the identity of who you are
[1:27:25] lies in the revelation of your
[1:27:28] father the new
[1:27:30] birth is your identification that comes
[1:27:34] from
[1:27:35] above that is your
[1:27:40] identity like I said and I repeated it
[1:27:43] several times this message is my
[1:27:46] identity I can no longer be separated
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:54] I am this
[1:27:56] message I'm a living
[1:27:58] epistle do I make mistakes that's that
[1:28:01] other
[1:28:05] guy that's the guy that I live with
[1:28:08] that's the guy that stumbles and Falls
[1:28:09] that's the guy when I let him resurrect
[1:28:12] he gets
[1:28:14] his huh come on now but the inside of
[1:28:18] you as a
[1:28:20] representation there is no sin you
[1:28:23] cannot what why because you have the
[1:28:25] seed of God remains inside of
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:42] you watch
[1:28:44] this spiritual Amnesia continuing on now
[1:28:47] there is a
[1:28:49] place that when you get this Amnesia you
[1:28:51] might get like Nebuchadnezzar how many
[1:28:53] you remember remember him yeah watch it
[1:28:57] it was who exalted himself one time and
[1:29:00] God let him think he was an
[1:29:03] animal and he lived out in the
[1:29:05] wilderness ate grass like an ox how many
[1:29:08] of you remember that in the
[1:29:10] Bible I wonder all these people that
[1:29:12] don't have identity well I think I'm a
[1:29:16] cat they even have litter boxes for him
[1:29:19] in school you got to be kidding me
[1:29:26] I think I'm a
[1:29:29] bull I think I'm a big
[1:29:32] cow you can put a nose ring through my
[1:29:36] you know why they put rings in cattle's
[1:29:40] noses you ever been around
[1:29:42] them so you just hook up a lead rope
[1:29:46] when a cow starts walking
[1:29:50] away all of these
[1:29:52] piercings and all of the this stuff why
[1:29:56] do you
[1:29:56] think that all of this piercings and
[1:30:00] tattoos it's because it's an Iden it's
[1:30:03] an
[1:30:05] identity Satan marks his
[1:30:09] people their mind a bore them through
[1:30:13] the ear because God marks his too he
[1:30:17] gives them a
[1:30:19] sign amen
[1:30:24] says his hairs grow out down on his body
[1:30:26] like eagle feathers he had become the
[1:30:29] heart of a beast in him see that was
[1:30:31] Amnesia because he had forgotten that he
[1:30:33] was a
[1:30:34] king he had forgotten that he was a
[1:30:37] human being he thought he was an animal
[1:30:40] so he acted like an animal because he
[1:30:43] forgot he was a human being so that's so
[1:30:46] easy today and we forget sometimes that
[1:30:49] the what the Christian church
[1:30:51] is we act like the World shows
[1:30:54] that we got spiritual Amnesia
[1:30:58] because that you don't act like the
[1:31:01] Christian you act like the world you
[1:31:03] receive the heart of the world and it
[1:31:05] causes this God help
[1:31:12] us like that little Eagle hatched out in
[1:31:15] a chicken
[1:31:16] yard amen cluck cluck cluck trying to
[1:31:19] act happy out here finding a little

[1:38:08] stop and look up
[1:38:13] amen sometimes that's the only way God
[1:38:16] can get a hold of your attention because
[1:38:17] you know what he passes by your way
[1:38:20] often through sermons through telephone
[1:38:22] calls through letters through through
[1:38:23] your Bible through songs and all kinds
[1:38:26] of different ways and guess what you
[1:38:28] didn't
[1:38:29] know God was passing by trying to get
[1:38:33] your attention and you are
[1:38:35] so
[1:38:40] hardheaded he said verse six then

[1:39:20] Excellency and array thyself
[1:39:23] with glory and
[1:39:25] Beauty amen did you
[1:39:27] know that the woman is the glory of the
[1:39:35] man wow let that sink
[1:39:40] K the bride yes is the glory of
[1:39:46] Christ that's why she doesn't cut her
[1:39:49] hair because of the
[1:39:51] Angels you think it's a simple thing
[1:39:55] it's okay for you to cut your hair to
[1:39:57] trim your hair the scripture says if you
[1:40:00] cut your hair you might as well look
[1:40:02] like the
[1:40:06] pastor paraphrasing a little
[1:40:08] bit you might as well be
[1:40:14] Shor because you dishonor your head but
[1:40:17] when you leave your hair
[1:40:21] uncut as a virtue un to God guess
[1:40:26] what it's his
[1:40:29] glory and God honors
[1:40:31] you because of the
[1:40:35] angels I got a book I'll show you
[1:40:37] something I'll bring it here at to
[1:40:38] church it's little thin books called a a
[1:40:41] hair short of
[1:40:42] Glory talks about all the scriptures and
[1:40:45] different things concerning why a woman
[1:40:47] has long hair and it's a glory given
[1:40:49] under her
[1:40:55] it is a time when we should get our
[1:40:59] understanding from
[1:41:01] God do not read your Bible like you read
[1:41:03] a
[1:41:04] newspaper do not listen to this message
[1:41:08] like you just listen to some internet
[1:41:10] speaker but sit down and reverently and
[1:41:13] ask God and humble thyself and say oh
[1:41:17] God I am a I am a man a Carly minded man
[1:41:21] God get me above a all of my carnality
[1:41:24] let me go beyond this understanding of
[1:41:27] my carnal mind and open unto me the
[1:41:29] ramparts of Heaven let thy glory be
[1:41:32] known unto me give me Revelation give me

[1:43:36] your mouth right because if you miss the
[1:43:39] Rapture it's because you
[1:43:42] failed to discern
[1:43:45] yourself to take the word as a judgment
[1:43:48] to yourself you play around with the
[1:43:50] things of the world
[1:43:55] it's time to get wisdom and
[1:43:58] understanding because there's a deep
[1:43:59] calling to the Deep

[1:44:07] mesic she said well you jump remember
[1:44:10] she tell come up higher well you jump

[1:44:14] chicken see identi was coming to him
[1:44:19] from
[1:44:20] above that's the way we do we accept God
[1:44:22] by Faith by the written word there is
[1:44:25] something in there it's that eternal
[1:44:28] life you were predestinated to it listen
[1:44:32] I was predestinated to this
[1:44:35] message I was born for
[1:44:38] it oh yeah I didn't know who I was and I
[1:44:41] bounced around here and there in fact
[1:44:43] there's still some times that I kind of
[1:44:46] have to get re reminded
[1:44:53] let me tell you you don't get this
[1:44:56] message by hearing just a couple tapes
[1:44:59] it's like a jigsaw puzzle you take this
[1:45:03] piece you know what it's funny I'm going
[1:45:06] to tell a little thing on Amos when we
[1:45:09] do jigsaw puzzles he take three or four
[1:45:11] pieces and put them in his
[1:45:13] pocket and here you're trying where is
[1:45:16] that piece I look everywhere I can man
[1:45:18] what's the name of that sermon where
[1:45:21] where did Brother brand say that I don't
[1:45:24] I and then Amos finally here it
[1:45:27] is who is this m fits right here what is
[1:45:31] the attraction fits right over here Amos
[1:45:34] you've been holding out on me
[1:45:38] son some of you've been holding
[1:45:41] out because you ain't putting the pieces
[1:45:43] to the puzzle where they
[1:45:45] go because you just think that you know
[1:45:47] the whole picture of God it doesn't come
[1:45:49] to you until all of the piece is there
[1:45:52] and there before our wondering eyes
[1:45:54] there it is there it
[1:45:57] is it's
[1:45:59] him it's
[1:46:01] Christ there he is they took the
[1:46:05] picture he said I was looking at it
[1:46:09] wrong and he says there was the cloud
[1:46:12] they took the picture I didn't take
[1:46:16] it he said I I don't the angel said
[1:46:20] you're not looking at it right turn it
[1:46:22] to the right
[1:46:24] sometimes you are looking so hard at
[1:46:26] this message you can't see
[1:46:29] it turn it
[1:46:31] right get the right Revelation cuz when
[1:46:34] the true church catches the true
[1:46:37] revelation of who she is and what she
[1:46:41] stands for and she begins to discern and
[1:46:44] withstand the two Spirits within the
[1:46:46] framework of the church amen then and
[1:46:49] only then will she stand as an
[1:46:51] invincible Army amen
[1:47:02] amen then this is who is this mil then
[1:47:06] after you recognize the very word of God
[1:47:07] was Eagle food then you left the other
[1:47:10] thing you'd
[1:47:12] been you have then been formed into the
[1:47:15] living image of the Living God you heard
[1:47:17] from
[1:47:19] your theophany
[1:47:23] let that sink
[1:47:27] in the part of you that never fell in

[1:47:40] calling to you amen since

[1:47:57] I it wasn't until this
[1:48:00] message came across my path and
[1:48:03] something said come up
[1:48:06] here there was a deep calling to the
[1:48:09] Deep you say was it the voice of William
[1:48:12] brandom yeah God used his voice but
[1:48:15] there was a voice behind his voice there
[1:48:18] was a message within the message there
[1:48:20] was an encrypted message to me
[1:48:23] me and not everybody that heard the same
[1:48:26] tape heard the same thing that I heard
[1:48:28] nor did they come up with the same
[1:48:30] reasoning that I came up with but there
[1:48:32] was something inside of me that was
[1:48:34] telling me come up
[1:48:40] here Hebrews chapter 4
[1:48:43] 1957 in the beginning was the same he
[1:48:47] was that great spirit Fountain where all
[1:48:49] the tress all the love all the peace
[1:48:51] everything that was pureed
[1:48:53] was in this Fountain and began to form a
[1:48:57] body a
[1:48:59] theophany the kind of body that we go to
[1:49:02] not a glorified body an Angelic
[1:49:06] body like has shape and form every time
[1:49:10] I see a tree that tree is a negative
[1:49:13] there is a positive somewhere so now
[1:49:15] he's taking natural and
[1:49:17] spiritual that tree was made of
[1:49:20] something and intelligence made it and
[1:49:22] and all this Earth does is reflect the
[1:49:26] Heavenly amen amen see I see a man
[1:49:29] lovely Little Couple man and wife
[1:49:32] walking down the street sweethearts
[1:49:33] together what does it reflect blessed be
[1:49:35] the name of the Lord there is one in
[1:49:37] heaven that will not
[1:49:39] purish if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:49:42] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:49:45] the
[1:49:48] theophany I hear it calling me come up
[1:49:54] come up a little
[1:49:58] higher into the revealed
[1:50:05] word
[1:50:08] amen this this old body that you have
[1:50:12] here you might be a young person 18 20
[1:50:14] years old yeah you
[1:50:17] looking pretty buff boys
[1:50:26] yeah guess
[1:50:28] what after about 20 years of
[1:50:32] age your treasure
[1:50:36] chest
[1:50:40] sinks you might look pretty buff right
[1:50:42] now but you know what it's just a matter
[1:50:44] of
[1:50:47] time bodily
[1:50:49] exercise profits a little
[1:50:53] some of you want more than a
[1:50:56] little that's all right but
[1:50:58] remember it's just going to profit a
[1:51:02] little I want to ask you how many of you
[1:51:04] do your spiritual
[1:51:11] calisthenics I command my hand to praise
[1:51:15] the Lord I command my hand to praise the
[1:51:20] Lord I command my hand but I sit there
[1:51:23] like a log and don't do anything I don't
[1:51:26] I don't even have control of my
[1:51:29] hand I control my
[1:51:35] feet some of you ain't even got control
[1:51:40] right you know what I just like to let
[1:51:43] my body I'm going to bring it into
[1:51:45] subjection well I don't feel
[1:51:48] like I don't feel like praising the Lord
[1:51:52] let me tell you yeah some of the best
[1:51:56] times to praise the Lord is when you're
[1:51:57] in the heat of the
[1:52:00] batt because when you got
[1:52:03] money when things are going good when
[1:52:06] the wife loves you the kids love you and

[2:05:29] father have become one there's been an
[2:05:32] invisible Union musicians if you'll
[2:05:39] come did you know that this message
[2:05:42] declares the identity of every elect
[2:05:46] SE and if it doesn't you're not El SE
[2:05:53] I'm
[2:05:56] sorry can't
[2:05:58] be because this
[2:06:01] message it is the spirit speaking
[2:06:03] through the prophet
[2:06:05] Amen to he that hath an ear let him
[2:06:10] hear there's not a time that I put on a
[2:06:13] tape of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:06:16] but what God begins to speak to me and I
[2:06:19] realize it wasn't brother Bram
[2:06:26] in the Christ is the mystery of God
[2:06:27] revealed let me bring this to a close
[2:06:29] here for a moment Christ in you makes
[2:06:32] him the center of life of the
[2:06:36] Revelation see Christ's life in you
[2:06:40] makes him the center of the
[2:06:42] Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the
[2:06:46] Bible the complete revelation of Christ
[2:06:48] and Christ in you
[2:06:51] makes you the complete revelation of the
[2:06:54] whole
[2:06:57] thing see what God's trying to
[2:07:00] do what is the new birth
[2:07:02] then you'd say well brother Brenham what
[2:07:05] is the new birth it's the revelation of
[2:07:07] Jesus Christ personally to
[2:07:11] you amen see not joined a church shook a
[2:07:15] hand done something different you set a
[2:07:18] Creed you promised to live by a code of
[2:07:20] rules
[2:07:22] but Christ the Bible is the word that
[2:07:25] was revealed to you and no matter what
[2:07:28] anybody says what takes place it's
[2:07:31] Christ Pastor priest whatever it be it's
[2:07:34] Christ in you that is the
[2:07:37] Revelation that the church was built

[2:11:10] there from the genes of God the word of
[2:11:13] God that was placed in there each one of
[2:11:16] you think of things similar things see
[2:11:19] there was something moving
[2:11:23] yet all at once I looked up and I said I
[2:11:25] am not the son of Charles and Ella
[2:11:28] Branham there something
[2:11:33] calling he was
[2:11:36] coming to
[2:11:39] himself his theophany was speaking to
[2:11:42] him you are not the son of Charles and
[2:11:47] elram I've called you to a higher
[2:11:49] calling
[2:11:52] I'm sending you West to meet with seven
[2:11:56] angels you're going to be caught up into
[2:11:59] a consolation of angels and there each
[2:12:02] Angel has a mystery of each seal and he
[2:12:05] will break to you the mystery of that
[2:12:07] first seal second seal and that seventh
[2:12:10] angel when I looked at him he was more
[2:12:16] familiar my what about this message
[2:12:21] what about it you young
[2:12:24] people what about that picture with a
[2:12:27] halo over brother brandham what about
[2:12:31] the
[2:12:32] cloud what about all the supernatural
[2:12:34] signs what about all the visions
[2:12:38] that what's it all about is it is H have
[2:12:42] we just now put it to a couple Creeds
[2:12:44] and dogmas long hair long
[2:12:47] skirts men without long
[2:12:50] hair men don't wear shorts is that what
[2:12:53] we've made this
[2:12:56] message Creeds and
[2:12:58] [Music]
[2:13:01] dogmas oh
[2:13:05] God he says then I was born again this
[2:13:08] little life was laying there the life of
[2:13:11] water was poured upon it and it begins
[2:13:14] to grow now that old life was forgiven
[2:13:17] put in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[2:13:18] never to be remed against me no more
[2:13:24] the Heavenly identity began to come to
[2:13:26] brother Brenham to the place where he
[2:13:28] said I'm not the son of Charles an
[2:13:32] elant he said I am a predestinated
[2:13:35] ordained seed Gene of
[2:13:38] God he said God has called me to preach
[2:13:41] this message and that's what I got to be
[2:13:43] loyal
[2:13:47] to he began to know who he was he took
[2:13:50] his position in the Body of
[2:13:52] [Music]
[2:13:57] Christ we all got to recognize who we
[2:14:01] are so I too say
[2:14:04] this because of what I have heard
[2:14:08] through the voice of its seventh angel

[2:14:18] of God for ordained

[2:15:41] come open yes thank you Jesus I've heard
[2:15:45] and seen the seventh angel I have
[2:15:48] wrestled with the messenger
[2:15:51] and he blessed me and he changed my life
