bless you all this morning let's just remain standing thank you musicians each and everyone amen yeah we certainly are in perilous times you've all I'm sure heard of the Assassin attempt on uh former president Trump and how things could change in America here and just in a matter of moments and everything and uh we do not put our hope in Trump we don't look for Maga to to solve anything we know that America's day is over and she's floundering she's floundering she's trying to keep herself upright but brother AB said it's thus sayith the lord kabad it's been written on the wall the handwriting is there it took a prophet of God to let us know that so our hope is not in America it's not in our system it's not in our world system it's in the word system amen amen and uh um I'm happy to be in church this morning I've had uh different ones say brother Ron are you done with the sermon or the subject of of trying the spirits within the message and uh uh I will be launching off into another segment or another inspiration of that same uh topic here in the next few days and uh going into things such as the discernment of spirits and so we'll be looking at that also um and so uh the other day I was visiting with my son Amos and Paul Maple and we were just fellowshipping and I love it when Brethren get together and you Fellowship around the the word of God am because uh you know the sports and everything I'm not interested in that I could care less who plays on what team and who's in first place I could care less there's only one player I want to be associated with and that's Jesus Christ amen he voted for me a long time ago so I cast my vote for him and I know I won't lose if I'm on his team so we were talking and I was fellowshipping with the Brethren and I said you know I've always wanted to preach on the thief on the cross so we want to look at that take a little bit of a detail look at that and dissect it down and everything and I think we can all identify turn with me if you would to the Book of Job chapter 14 then we'll go to Psalms 106 and then we'll go to Luke Hallelujah Job chapter 14: 13- 17 oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave thou wouldest keep me secret until the Wrath thy wrath be passed that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change Come Thou shalt sh call and I will answer thee thou wil have a desire to work to the work of thy hands for now thou Nest my steps does thou not watch over my sin my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou seest up mine iniquity I want you to notice in verse 13 that thou wouldest appoint me to a set time and remember me turn with me to Psalms 106 Psalms 106 veres 1-5 praise ye the Lord give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord who can show forth all his praise blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doth righteousness at all times remember me oh Lord with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people oh visit me with thy salvation that I may see the good of thy chosen that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy Nation that I may Glory With Thine inheritance turn with me now to Luke chapter 23 you know even as I was studying this and the Holy Spirit was really moving upon me I went into our bedroom Sandy was fixing her hair and I told her of this inspiration and and I just wept and wept and I shared with her a oneperson congregation and I was just sitting there preaching away and I pray that God will give us the same inspiration now saints of God how can we ever look at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and not be touched I remember as a 9-year-old boy the first time I ever heard what was called the cross talk I was at Green o Ranch boys camp in California our parents sent us away to just get rid of us for a few days and in the summer and so we were there and I remember everything you had to do uh you had to anything you wanted to do in the camp uh to ride the train or to shoot a bow and arrow you had to memorize scripture and I thought that was so unfair because you know hey uh uh you know I wasn't good at memory and so oh my remember they gave me a a everybody got their own little verse and so they gave me one uh Romans 5'8 for God commandeth his love toward us that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us didn't know what it meant I thought what's that word commendeth his love what what what do you mean and everything and but I rode the train I shot the bow and arrow and it was given a Bible a little pocket New Testament and I wrote inside there Ron Peterson received this Bible because he was born again had no idea what Born Again meant but I sure L that little pocket Bible somehow I lost it and growing up I remember the first book I turned to was the book of Romans because we had just seen Ben her and Gladiator and Spartacus and all this stuff so I was thinking of Romans and fighting and all that so I read the book of Romans but how many of you love the Lord this morning isn't his word so precious okay let us read here Luke [Music] 23:32 there were also two other malifa LED with him to be put to death and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the malifa one on the right hand and the other on the left then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his reignment and cast lots and the people stood beholding and rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be Christ The Chosen of God and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the Jews save thyself and a subscription also was written over him in the letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew this is the king of the Jews and one of the malifa which were hang hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us and the other answering rebuked him saying dust thou not fear dust not thou fear God seeing that thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the doe reward of our Deeds but this man hath done nothing a miss and he said unto Jesus notice he addresses him Lord and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise may God add the blessing to the reading of his word you all may be seated this morning in the presence of God I'd like to title my sermon this morning remember me it's amazing how that the Bible is doesn't give us a lot of information about this thief who says this but I've always wanted to preach on this because it's always stuck with with me that this thief was admitting to his own guilt hey we justly are dying for what we've done we got caught this man has done nothing he says don't you fear God speaking to his other friend who is a thief also you know the Bible doesn't tell us was he B baptized doesn't say did you ever hear a sermon of Jesus Christ were you ever in his meetings how long did you serve him if you served him at all and let me dramatize on this a little bit this morning but you I want you to notice that the one on the left said if thou be the Son of God you see if thou be he didn't know no there was no Revelation he wasn't speaking by Revelation if thou be the Son of God take us down and you yourself do something do some kind of a miracle and we'll believe how it pricked the heart of the thief on the right and said don't you fear God see there must have been representation there had to been representation there in his life and he was predestinated unto Hallelujah election you see that talk about Grace and election you think about this guy you talk about coming as the door is closing or as it's coming down like this the last guy to slide right through underneath safe talk about as the door of the Old Testament was closing and right before the shedding of the blood of the Lamb of God so here all of the Old Testament Saints and this is the last one to come in at the last moment you talk about Grace and [Applause] election the Bible doesn't tell us that he was a disciple doesn't tell us that he got baptized doesn't say that he was a follower of Jesus Christ but there he is and I want to say this when we get over there in heaven and we we walk around and we begin to shake one another's hands and ask what church age what dispensation were you under and we will meet many different ones you will meet doubting Thomas that word doubting will always be there because you'll when you oh you're you're you're doubting Thomas yeah yeah that's me but I'm here anyway you will meet Rahab the Harlot she say that's me but by his grace I'm here you will meet many others you'll meet John the Beloved but when you come to this guy we don't even know his name you probably shake his hand and say hey let me have your testimony who are you what dispensation were you in uh give us a tell us how you got saved how did you make it here he'd say do you remember the thief on the cross he put his head down he said that's me you mean you weren't a disciple you weren't baptized you didn't hear the the words of Jesus and you made it how did you make it he said the man in the middle you think about Grace and election here he was at the point of his death and he had an opportunity to see Jesus Christ and he has only one sentence that he says to him and the word had never spoken to him before and he says Lord meaning Master remember me when you come into your kingom wow I want you to remember me in the most endearing words from Jesus as he's dying I tell you this day Thou shalt be with me in Paradise thank you Jes just think about it just a millisecond after his death after his heartbeats it's last time get guess what all of a sudden wow he's in that other dimension everybody's shaking his hand hey welcome wow and you know everybody rejoicing and he's going wow and everybody asking how'd you get here I don't know all I know is I said something and something happened so let me dramatize this just a little bit for you if you don't mind let me kind of go on the dialogue as if I'm the thief so he begins to tell the story because everybody wants to know how did you get here man tell us your testimony says well to begin with I got to hanging around the wrong crowd at a young age and got to doing things wrong and wasn't raised in church my parents were not religious and we got caught we got sentenced to death and there are three of us that were to be crucified but we were guilty because we had done wrong and we we knew of we do the crime we're going to do the time and we had been out doing some things wrong and stealing from people and we were put in jail and one of our colleagues who was with us he was caught at the same time and his name is barabus barabus they were as inmates in the same prison barabus and these two other malifa and no doubt that they probably conversed one with another and said hey man why are you in here why are you well barus was a robber and said we all hung around together and when we were in prison waiting to be sentenced we heard soldiers coming and they came and took barabus and Jesus from the prison cell now we tried to talk to this man Jesus but he never talked to us he was as a lamb dumb before his hearers and they took these two out and oh there was a great crowd out in the cour cour yard and there was a there was a feeling of hatred in the air people wanted blood for some reason they had heard there's going to be a crucifixion and like it was in the time of the the old west here in the United States when they said they're going to have a hanging it was a time for people to gather together families and have a picnic watch somebody get killed and the courtyard was filled and all of these people were there and Pontius pilot was saying do you know that it is a custom that this time of year that if somebody is going to be sentenced that we can take and we can choose and let one of them go free and he brought be barabus and we watched as they brought him before all of the people and said which shall I give to you barabus or Jesus the king of the Jews and they yelled all as though it was one voice give us barab us can you imagine they knew he was was a robber they knew the things that he had done and yet they chose someone like that over an innocent one who's being condemned and there was no sin he committed you could feel the hatred among the people they yell give us Robb us and he says but what shall I do with Christ turn with me if you would to John 18 because I love to follow this through scripture John 18: 36 Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence and pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate said to him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again to the Jews and saith unto them I find no I find in him no fault at all this is the first time he is now Tried by the highest court in Rome and Pontius Pilate makes a declaration I find no fault at all in him you see the lamb has got to be found without spot blameless but ye have a custom that I should release unto you one at the Passover will you therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews they cried then cried they all again saying not this man but Barabas now barabus was a robber chapter 19 verse1 and pil therefore took Jesus and scourged him and the soldiers plated a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put it on him a purple robe and said hail King of the Jews and they smokee him with their hands pilate therefore went again and saith un him behold I bring forth you that you may know I find no fault in him then came Jesus forth wearing a crown of thorns and a purple robe and pilate saith unto them behold the man and when a chief priest therefore and officers saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him pilate say to them take ye him and crucify him for I find no fault in him well Thief who we don't even know your name tell us how did you get here well let me finish the story because I'm an eyewitness I was there when Jesus was brought before the people I heard him cry crucified I saw when they took Jesus out and they ripped off the robe off of his back and they tied him to a whipping post and I saw a centurion come and take a cat of Ninetails and I saw him scourged I saw him his flesh of his bag bloody and bruised and wounded and the more that they saw blood the more they wanted blood I can't explain it but there was something about this man there was something inside of me that when pontious pilate said behold the man I saw a man greater than a man he was more than a man I going to ask you what do you see do you see just the man behold the man there he was all bloodied and bruised opening not his mouth I watched him as they took him from the whipping post and brought him up and pontious pilot tried to wash his hands of it his wife even had a dream said don't have anything to do with this guy I've had a dream this night tries to wash his hands I don't know I'm not a religious man I haven't been to church I wasn't raised in church I hung around wrong people and I really can't explain what happened to me but when Pontius Pilate said behold the man something happened I don't know what you call it some may call it a vision but he said I saw him transform into a bloody lamb I don't know I'm not religious I don't know what was happening to me but something when he said behold the man I saw more than a man I can't explain it then the Roman guards come and they took us out of our cell and they said we're taking you now to be crucified and they said they made Jesus carry his cross on Via delosa we watched him we watched him as he carried under the weight of the Cross and how they were whipping him and how that it was such a horrible scene but said we looked into the faces of those in the crowd and there were some that hated him so vehemently they just yelled crucify him some took rotten food and different things that they could and threw it at him making fun and sport of him and yet I tell you there were others that we looked and they were they were weeping and wailing no no don't do this to him what is he done of what sin did he commit people mocking and laughing yet the others who called him Messiah they were there weeping till we came to a place called golgatha a place of the skull also known as Calvary and there the [Music] multitude came around us and the three of us were crucified yeah but how did you get saved man quit holding me in suspense what did you do to be saved he says hang on let me tell you it all happened so quickly events were transpiring and it seems surreal and I only spoke to him one time but when I did there was something inside of me that said call him Lord Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom because I had no idea when his kingdom will come I've got no idea is there life after death I don't know I've never lived by that I haven't gone to church I'm not religious but I know this the what few words I heard him as he was being brought before pontious pilot something resonated inside of me this man speaks truth there is a kingdom if my kingdom were of this world he said there was something about it yeah and I knew his kingdom he would come into it soon and so I spoke to him Lord remember me amen I don't know about you but I resonate with that myself this morning remember me Lord a lot of people say oh lord lord and I know him and stuff but will he remember them for there will become many in that day that say Lord Lord didn't I do this in your name didn't I cast out Devils didn't I do this and he said he never denied what they did but he says depart from me you workers of iniquity I don't remember you I didn't know you wouldn't it be horrible to to to get there and you say I know him I know him and when you get before him he who is omniscient and all knowing and he says I never knew you who are you what how did you get saved I don't know it was the man in the middle I can't explain it I don't know how I got here but I'm here brother Brenham says in the sardian church age now watch these seven spirits say now let me just stop here a moment before I do this because the thief that gets eternal life is on the right hand somebody say right hand and the thief on the right so you have a left and a right is that correct remember that certain things in scriptures have have meanings notice that he was on the right hand much of the Bible refers to the right hand of God I've told you there are five times more scriptures about God 's right hand than his left hand and I want to ask you is God ambidextrious does he only use his right hand well what about his left hand and you that are left-handed does that make you feel odd because you're left-handed because the Bible talks about more of God's right hand well no brother Brenham says and we'll show you the quote here let's just read this now now watch these seven spirits in other words holds his Messengers Messengers that will be Anointed with him with the holy spirit with this same holy spirit that Paul the first one Anointed with first 2 third fourth fifth 6th seventh all of them are in the right hand oh deriving their power and their light from his right hand he ascended on high and Phillip when he was dying or Stephen see I see Heavens open and Jesus sitting on the right hand of God it don't mean that God's got a great big right hand and he's sitting on it but right hand means right hand of power and authority little did this thief know on his right hand he would find power from God Joseph the Bible says sat at the right hand of pharaoh Jesus sat at the right hand of God the thief on the right hand of Jesus Christ and on the white Throne will he not say unto his sheep move onto my right hand it's a p it's a place of position and Authority listen closely the right hand doesn't really physically mean uh the right hand but it means to be on the right side oh thank you Lord I'm on the right right hand I'm on the right side it means the right location right position also meant Viewpoint or ability to perceive he the thief on the right hand Lord remember me wow is that all you said is that all you did yeah I had no other opportunity this was my only space of opportunity this was it spiritual food in due season one day turning it to the right look there was Jesus Christ just as perfect as Hoffman ever draw him standing there with a white wig on looking back down towards the Earth showing that he is supreme authority the heavens declare it the Bible declares it message declares it all the same supreme authority with the white wig on see his black beard under many of you have seen the picture we got it back there just turn it to the right sideways look at it there he is just as perfect perfect as it was if it had been photographed of him they're looking at it from the wrong angle you got to look at it from the right angle and only the Lord can reveal which is the right angle turn it to the right and look at it amen that's what he did with the picture amen he was looking at it this way I just see a cloud no you're not looking at it right turn it to the right angle he turns it what oh my there he is you see the perception the power the light of God coming from God himself letting you know that's more than a cloud amen that's why those who say well it was some kind of uh vapor trail of some kind of Rocket or they were looking at it wrong I'm sorry every time God does something in the Supernatural somebody with a carnal mind tries to give some kind kind of natural explanation they did it in the first Exodus every time there was well the Nile turned red because there was up Upstream something went wrong and it made the the water turn red look like blood and the fish and flies and fleas and everybody tries with a carnal mind to explain the supernatural but when you you look at it right right-and blessings you remember I I I spoke about the right-and blessings of God they are powerful there are things that when you have a right-and blessing you you feel it it's anointed it's God giving you a right-hand blessing but what about his left hand does God not use his left hand the Bible says on the left hand where he doth work on the road to a the two emus means Earnest desire the two disciples after the crucifixion they're walking along and they're sad and Jesus joins himself an invisible Union to them and says why are you so sad where have you been Buddy this same Jesus who we thought was it and was crucified and we watched him be placed in a tomb all hopes are gone and he began to take the scriptures concerning himself and he began to say but didn't this say didn't wasn't this the scripture and here and all of a sudden they begin to get a little excited right hand blessing but see right after rightand blessings watch this many times God from the right hand blessing he comes and he anoints you and he he gives you a great blessing and you feel so powerful oh God let me stay here and then turns right around and God moves under the left hand turns invisible again many times you will have a great time with God and there'll be a right-and blessing and then turn right around and the next morning you're going to be fighting the devil and find out where are you God he's there but just in the invisible Realm the thief is about ready to receive the full benefits of just a few words remember me in the sermon God being misunderstood and the Pharisees and Priests misunderstood stood him if thou be the Son of God bring yourself down off of there the thief on his left misunderstood him if thou be the Son of God take us off the cross save yourself and us too but the thief on the right understood him I want to ask you why did he understand him he want a churchgoer but he had representation my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow there was something that happened to me when Pontius Pilate said behold the man I asked before all of you this day Jesus Christ of Nazareth when he was crucified and I say do you just behold the man let him come out of History who do you see when you behold the man but the thief on the right understood him he said we have and we've done evil and we deserve what we're getting but this man's done nothing Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom watch the that voice come back today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise he understood that that was God dying for our sins I want to ask you how did he know that there was something inside of him that knew that the lamb must be slain there was something there was representation unto election let me tell you that these things that we are seeing in our minds and the revelations that God gives To Us by faith is because you were with him before the foundation of the world before anything was even said and done before you did good or evil predestinated unto election wow I don't know about you but when I think about that Thief we we get over there and we shake his hand which one are you I don't know what his name is the Bible is silent but he'll tell you his name he said but you remember the story of the thief on the cross on the right hand I'm the right-and thief he understood what was going on questions answers 64 brother brim says now I believe the reason Paul had to be baptized there because it's official and it's essential with the Bible that we are baptized because I take right back to this then when the thief was hanging on the cross he died without being baptized at all and yet with a promise that Jesus would meet him in Paradise that day in paradise not in the regions of the lost because it was the first time the opportunity was presented to him wow this is that thief's first opportunity and he took the opportunity he said the right words just like hady right you see sometimes you will Express with your voice you will say the right thing at the right time and it will please God and the pillar of fire tell them you can have what you have need of remember me when you come into your kingdom I tell you today thou shall be with me in Paradise wow you talk about a guy sliding inise god well what did you do Thief I just got caught but I was caught by somebody else also I was caught CAU up at the moment I can't explain to you all I know as I said remember me and here I am how'd you get here I don't know he says I think you guys call it Grace how many of you say grace do you know Grace do you no Grace Hallelujah the Bible says of for all had sinned and come short of the glory of God but for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ what a game Cher in this man's life one moment how did it happen the man in the middle how'd you get here blame him he didn't have any stars he didn't have anything to his effect other than the fact he was elect seed the only way you can look at it and I want to tell you that if you make it it's not because of what you've done how'd you get here man in the middle wow it was his first opportunity 1 Corinthians 6: 9-1 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither for fornicator nor idolators nor adulterers nor AFF feminite nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor revivers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were and such were some of you are you listen name he was a thief thieves shall not enter into the kingdom how how are you going to get in how did you get here wow such were some of you but ye are washed Lord but ye are Sanctified ye are justified in the same in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God you see the old dispensation of law was turning to Grace he had to be crucified set Between Heaven and Earth and there the mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus behold the man some saw some historical figure I saw more than that as a young boy nine years of age why did he die for me who am I I don't know nothing wasn't raised in church my parents are not religious Jesus Christ is a cuss word in our home I thought why would God die for me because he was crucified before the foundation of the world and I want to ask you where were you in him you were his thoughts you were his seat and he was thinking of you you were in his mind before the foundation of the world the lamb was crucified before you were born before you had done good or evil before you thought you made a decision for Christ he made a decision for you amen thank you Lord Lord wow the thief didn't really know when Jesus would come into his kingdom he just said when you come and now Jesus brings him into an eternal r today you're going to be with me in Paradise can you imagine in just I don't know if it's hours or just a few minutes later and Christ gives up The Ghost and he says it is finished and there was Darkness over the Earth wow I don't know who died first was it the malifa did the thieves or was it Christ but I know this that when he died your sins which were many were forgiven and here this thief how did you get here buddy I can't tell you because I really don't know all I know is I'm here and I'm happy I'm here you talk about shouting and getting excited when you get over there some of you that are so reserved yeah some of you so reserved it's hard to get you to even sing when we all get to heaven or you you sit there like what a day of rejoicing I'm not even going to sing hey when you get over there and you know huh when you know when you know that you know that you know and it's made a reality to you it's going to be better than come on down I want go up there and hug the host and I'm happy I'm going to watch some of you get so excited I'm going say I knew it was in you the whole time you just was so reserved you wouldn't even break the sound barrier you sat there like a fossilized log and you would not rejoice but I knew it was in you I knew it would come out it was your day and you're not going to let some rock take your place and I'll tell you what I'm going to let my voice and I'm going to let myself begin to Rejoice cuz I ain't going to let no Rock nothing take my place this this is my day this is my [Applause] hour yes sir how'd you get her I don't know somebody played a tape for me what did you to deserve to hear the voice of God I don't know I just got done smoking dope thank you Lord I never look down my nose at others when they come because I don't judge a books by its cover and neither should us we look at somebody coming to church all tattooed I see these people my you just go through Kmart or you go anywhere you stand there and you see the tattoos and the earrings and the piercings they got a nose ring they got things on the side tattoos all over them their hair shave women shave their head on one side Little ponytail on the other and then you look at their kids oh man what hope do they got being raised that way but I'll say this it don't matter how you was raised it don't matter oh my God thank you Lord thank you Lord that those who witnessed to me did not look in my outer book amen they didn't judge me with my long air they didn't condemn me for doing what I did they just told me of a greater way Hallelujah this thief on the cross personifies more than any individual in the scripture of Grace and election CU he did nothing except confess with his mouth Lord remember me that's right amen that's all it took you think that could happen once again if somebody said Just remember me what if somebody come to church and there's a PR sweet presence of the Lord and the minister said now is there somebody here who doesn't know him but you want to know him and you'd like to raise your hand and say remember me brother brandom so many many times in his sermons he said while his presence is here and it wasn't a bunch of screaming and shouting and jumping no it was a reverent holy be still and know that I am God let me show you a couple places here before I close on the sermon the handwriting on the wall I'm just going to read this the highlighted portion sinner friend if you've never accepted Christ would you at this time raise your hand and say Lord Jesus be merciful to me God bless you lady God bless you over here you back there someone else just remember me Lord God bless you over here down here Lord be with you remember me oh Lord therefore except a man be born again he will in no wise enter in the kingdom and cannot even see the kingdom of God I love the scripture in Romans 9:11 for the children being not yet born neither having done he any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth amen Romans 11: 1-8 I say then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid for I am also in Israelite of the Seed of Abraham and of The Tribe of Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his people which he fornew amen hallelujah what ye not that the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets Dig Down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but the Lord answered but what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men amen who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal even so at this present time somebody say at this present time there is also a Remnant according to the election of Grace I believe I'm a part of that what about you I am a part of a remnant of all the thousands and millions of Christians on the face of the Earth I've got a little elect remnant an elect bride who has not bowed their knee to bail hallelujah hallelujah can God cast his people away God forbid even so at this present time also there is a Remnant according to into the election of Grace and if by Grace then it's no more of Works otherwise Grace is no more Grace but if it be of works then it's no more grace otherwise work is no more work what then Israel hath not obtained that which she seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded according it as written God hath given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear unto this day wow so in church age Church age book brother Brenham goes this I just want to read this carefully in St John 6:37 and 44 it says all that the father hath given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out no man can come except my father draw him I will raise him up at the last day John 1:12 through 13 but as many as received him gave he the power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Ephesians 1: 4-5 according as he ha chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world musicians if you'll come accordingly he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame him without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now without getting too involved in this subject of the sovereignity of God for that would take a book in itself let me point out there that according to these verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men chose their Brides today the bride today does not simply decide she's going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it's the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride John 15:16 you have not chosen me I've chosen you now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself Ephesians 1:9 Roman Romans 911 that the P purpose of God according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the hard purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world continuing on paragraph 281 now if we impute omniscience to God we must also accept that he is perfect in wisdom and righteousness this plan of election and reprobation is the wisdom of God revealed in all ages even as it says in Ephesians 1 3-11 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ accordingly has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated unto the adoption of his children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now I want you to notice when did the thief on the right when did he come in had a changing of dispensation the door was closing for the Jews and opening to the Gentiles house and here we are once again a changing of dispensation God is going to because the days of the Gentiles is almost fulfilled I wonder if the last one that comes in might be just like that Thief that would just [Music] say Remember Me Lord amen amen maybe they they weren't caught up in the message maybe they didn't hear about brother Brenham they didn't hear about the message of the hour and yet they were around and they were caught up in to a movement somebody testified to them I wonder if there could be somebody here today [Music] said you know I I relate to this [Music] guy I know who I am and I know if I got my Just Desserts I deserve Health but if there be somebody here today be B enough and say Remember Me Lord both of my hands are up oh God I'm not depending upon my works the sermons preached the things that I've done for you I'm just like that Thief that's head Remember Me Lord I pray with these hands that are up here right now with everyone their heart desires just saying Remember Me Lord when you come into your kingdom would you remember me God sees those hands every one of you each and every one if your heart is right before God may you be like that thief and say how did you get here I don't know but it was him the man in the middle tribulation is soon to set in the the day of grace to the Gentiles is almost over maybe you sitting here right now raising your hand you might be the last one just saying Remember Me Lord kind of a cut up sermon here this morning I relate to this thief that's me it's me don't you love him this morning my heart is pricked I can't say it was anything that I did if I get over there he said the angels will have to turn their head when that bride comes through and they're crying Grace Grace CU they don't know what it's like to be saved they don't know what it's like to be lost but how many of you say oh I know what it's like to be lost I say remember me Lord amen God bless you all this morning Heavenly Father Lord I'm trembling inside I know father it's just a simple sermon [Music] but how many times did your prophit and nearly every time that he cast The Net he saidis there just somebody here that raised their hand and say remember me yes God bless you sir yes you over there yes yes and it was making a difference with eternal life thank you father I pray take this little cut up sermon use it for your glory one day when we get over there and we shake this man's hand we'll get to know his name then we might hear a little bit more but I'll tell you he will say you remember the thief on the right hand of Christ at the crucifixion yeah that's me wow nothing but predestinated elect ction onto adoption because we were ordained to receive that light in our day I thank you I praise you father bless your people now let's all stand let's all stand amazing grace shall always be my song of praise for it was [Music] Grace that bought my libery come on now if you know Grace sing it I do not know just how he came to love me so he looked beond my fults all my I shall [Music] for lift my eyes to calary to view the cross where she Jus died for me how Mar the grace that my Fallen Soul he looked

you be seated for just a moment amen our lives are filled with trials you have your ups and downs you have your heartaches and your Sorrows that right and yet God delivers you from all of them this is unscripted it wasn't planned but my wife wanted to say something to you can I get your microphone I thought it might be better that I shared this instead of my husband but um I'm going to just share a little something that's personal or R it to me and um then I'm going to go on and explain but anyway when I made a decision to have the shoulder replacement um I had to wait 3 months and I got a really good doctor so it was worth it to me and it's been something my shoulders been painting me for a long time and cordone shots didn't work for the last several years I couldn't raise my hand and work I couldn't even hardly clap with pain hard for me to brush my hair and different things and so I knew the time was coming I and I was ready for it but N9 days before I found a lump on my breast so it's really interesting because you you really never know how you're going to handle things you know you always think you're going to be this way or that way and I had such a peace no fear at all even right now I don't but I thought I'd share I'd go back in my life um when I was six years old I well I was raised in a Catholic Family 12 children my mom had 12 single births in 16 years and I was in the middle I was very shy and very very insecure my dad we had no relationship with my father and I I don't think he knew how but um I I needed a father and so 6 years old I can remember I don't know what prompted it but I went into my closet and I started talking to him you know you could say prayer but for me it was talking and you know I was hurt and really crying within me and I went to him and I got in my closet and I poured my heart out to him and I can remember I mean you know in the Catholic Church you only are Tau to prayers I can remember walking out of that closet and I felt love like I had never felt before and so much comfort I can actually say that's where my relationship started with the Lord and from then on I was back in that closet back in the closet but also everywhere I went I prayed and I was such I was just a little girl that was so little I understood but you know what as time went on I actually felt like I I I had a father and that security was building up in me and I was figuring out even already who I was and I remember I mean I understand that from the day my natural birth I was my life was already planned out you know you're going to grow as you mature in life and you're going to go through the steps that bring you to the Holy Ghost and Beyond but with me my walk did grow and I mean I know I never fit into my family and they even knew it cuz I was different and I could actually say I my dad was a very Stern Catholic man but yet you know smoking and drinking and parting that was all in in the family I don't know how I grew up in this family and never did nothing but give it to the Lord I felt he had a hedge about me but I went to go back I as time went on whenever I went through a hard time whether it was grade school to high school and I went into prayer I had this imagery and it always brought me back even to this day to where I was walking with the Lord and he was holding my hand I was looking up at him but I was always 6 years old I felt because it was my beginning and every time I've gone into prayer and crying over something it always came back it was like my own personal Vision there I was and then I realized everything's going to be okay cuz he's holding my hand and I can only say through this that I I felt such a peace and just so comforted and you know you start thinking in your head like okay now what am I going to do and I got this surgery do I go forward with the surgery it probably sounded to the normal person pretty stupid because there would be a lot of pain that would come with it but I just felt good about it and Ron was fine and so I just went forth and I and I did did it but I also went ahead and did a mammogram and an ultrasound I and then when I got back from New York I had a biopsy and I have they found out I had um I had a lump in my breast that already found it was 7 mm and um so they have planed for the next week or so they're trying to move it up for a pet scan to see if it has gone through my body but I I I told Ron I mean I feel like my whole life has been Miracles I've watched God do my miracles in my life since I was a little girl and I'm like honey I'm going to hold on for a miracle I believe in miracles but also you know what this might sound crazy you guys but I'm perfectly fine to go on to be with the Lord I have no you know there's nothing there I have no I mean if the Lord said tomorrow I'd say I'm ready I'm just you know what but you know the hard part is not me it's it's my family it's it's it's wrong it's it's hard for your family it's easy to say I'm ready an early Rapture I'm going but for me it's always been what the about what's the lord's will for my life I just want his will and I you know what I'm like I'm skipping chemo forget it I'm going to go straight to the miracle I just I'm just I just know that all it is is what's in his plan for me and it's just one touch away if that's what he wants and if that's not what if the future is he wants to take me home it's going to be him either way and I'm happy with it and like I said is I do I I feel like I am I am so happy right now even though I'm going through this it's not affecting me negatively but it it is it's hurting me because I see how it hurts my husband and my kids are taking a little bit hard they like Mom you got to do something I am I'm just placing it in the Lord's hands like I have all these years and of course when I went to praying and I have been you know just praying a lot there's there I am I'm walking with the Lord he's holding my hand I always am looking up at him but I've never seen his face but I always knew it was him and um I just you know what sometimes are the children think they're too young but they're not your relation can can relationship with the Lord can start so young and you know what once you give your will over to him that you want him to be the one one that grows you up man he'll protect you from everything I actually think with kids that are maybe struggling with wanting the Holy Ghost all it is is laying your will down and asking the Lord to to for his will in your life he's going to give you the Holy Ghost to guide you it's so simple it's just he can't do it if you won't let go of your own will he can't do it if you won't you're not not willing to die to your own desires and your own things you just got to give it to him that's how I I grew up and that's where of course the Lord would lead me by election to the message and um it's been an amazing journey with the Lord and um I just want to say so you all can pray for me but don't worry about me I'm in God's hands and um I love you all so much and I look over the congregation I don't see any faults I see perfect people and I just love you and U thank the Lord for you all the time God bless [Applause] you he's got it all in control I know that our lives are in his hand my wife said I want to address the church I want to Daddy I don't want you to have to say it I don't want it done in a text I want to tell my kids myself I said all right she is one that those of you that have known us for many years it's always hard for Sandy to get up in front of a group but today she said I want my church up until this time there's just only been my family and a couple people that have known but I say I've got my faith and trust in God
