[45:12] me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah to the lamb.
[45:22] Glory to God in the highest. Amen. He's
[45:25] worthy of all that praise. The Bible
[45:28] says, you know, you're to prepare to
[45:30] meet your God. Amen. And we are to give
[45:33] him the praise that his name is due.
[45:38] Amen. God bless you this evening. My,
[45:41] it's wonderful to be here again. See all
[45:43] your smiling faces. Amen. to see my
[45:46] friends there, the Alderson family.
[45:48] Amen. Happy to have them tonight. Amen.
[45:51] I should probably make brother I should
[45:53] probably make them move up here on the
[45:54] front row so I can stare at them the
[45:56] whole
[45:58] service. Amen. I bet brother Dale and
[46:00] Sister Darlene would do it, but we'll
[46:02] leave them where they are. Amen. Happy
[46:05] to be here. I wanted to say how grand it
[46:07] is these services and um such a
[46:11] privilege to be invited. admire your
[46:12] pastor so much and I was just telling
[46:16] him in the back I admire the order of
[46:18] things and the precision and the
[46:20] timeliness and um you know there's just
[46:23] you that that's noticeable and uh so I
[46:26] really am appreciating it. The
[46:28] hospitality is southern. Amen. At its
[46:31] core I love it. Amen. Uh we uh you know
[46:34] I think I've already knited him but if
[46:37] not then I I'll renite him again and
[46:40] into the uh order of the southern
[46:42] gentleman. Amen. He is a wonderful
[46:45] brother and uh just um treats us too
[46:49] good. Amen. So it's an honor and a
[46:50] privilege to be here with him. Amen. So
[46:53] appreciate it all. Uh it's been a
[46:56] wonderful pleasure and a treat to
[46:58] minister alongside brother Chad, a
[47:00] friend of many years and I admire him. I
[47:03] think that uh we are we must be brothers
[47:06] of a different mother but the same
[47:10] father. Amen. And that's Harold Beckett
[47:13] saying that I like.
[47:15] Amen. But I I appreciate his um you know
[47:18] you know the the word of God, the Holy
[47:21] Ghost and the message of the hour uh
[47:23] didn't turn us into parrots. We're
[47:25] eagles.
[47:27] You know we don't just repeat what a
[47:29] prophet said. We teach what he taught.
[47:31] Amen. We preach what he preached. Amen.
[47:34] And we say what he said. But we are
[47:36] eagles. And we are preaching to a mature
[47:40] bride who's grown up from her infancy.
[47:42] Brother Brandham identified her as in
[47:45] her infancy at the time of the opening
[47:46] of the seals. Uh but you know, the Lord
[47:49] was never coming back to marry a little
[47:51] girl. He was coming back to marry a
[47:52] mature bride. Amen. So we uh we are
[47:56] eagles of strong meat and and and it has
[48:00] uh has not only taught us what to think
[48:02] but how to think. And uh that's
[48:05] beautiful. I love that. And so we're
[48:08] just want to look at the word of God
[48:10] tonight. And uh I'm going to I'm going
[48:12] to I'm told don't say 55 minutes
[48:15] tonight. So I'm not going to say it. And
[48:18] I probably wouldn't keep it if I said
[48:19] it. But Amen. And it's just wonderful to
[48:22] be here and uh just want to carry on and
[48:25] and unbburden my heart tonight. And uh
[48:29] Amen. Praise the Lord. We're going to
[48:30] invite you to Genesis chapter
[48:33] 15. And I I hope to start here and
[48:37] finish back here if possible. Don't
[48:40] guarantee. Um we don't get to choose
[48:43] that, believe it or not. I promise you
[48:46] friends. Um, sometimes you wonder why
[48:50] your pastor might do or put or go or say
[48:54] a certain thing and you wonder why he My
[48:57] wife has asked me, "Why did you why did
[48:59] you do it like that?" And I said, "I
[49:00] wish I knew." You know, why did you say
[49:03] it like that? I honey, all I can do is
[49:05] follow. I know better than to disobey
[49:07] that voice. I don't know. He doesn't
[49:09] explain everything to me, but I know it
[49:11] when I hear it. And if you and if you
[49:13] want to and if you want to uh know the
[49:16] voice of God, miss it one time,
[49:19] buddy. You'll know it almost
[49:21] immediately. Yes, sir. And uh but God is
[49:24] gracious and we don't like to miss it.
[49:26] So we uh we don't have an option. You
[49:30] know, that's the thing about ministers
[49:31] and particularly pastors. They really
[49:34] get to choose nothing.
[49:36] uh you you as the as the leoty you can
[49:39] put move do go you can live where you
[49:43] want to live have whatever job you want
[49:44] get you know uh a pastor doesn't get to
[49:47] choose anything he doesn't get to choose
[49:49] where he lives he doesn't get to choose
[49:51] where his assignment is he doesn't get
[49:53] to choose what he says he doesn't even
[49:56] get to choose what he thinks
[49:59] he's reserved unto God he's uh set aside
[50:02] and he he's not even allowed to keep
[50:04] hurt feelings
[50:06] and the people hurt his feelings, but
[50:07] he's not allowed to hang on to that.
[50:09] See, cuz he's reserved to Christ. He's
[50:11] he's set aside and we're not our own.
[50:13] And we're here uh to take uh you know,
[50:17] lambs out and take them on to the
[50:19] hillside and bring them back to the
[50:21] master mature and bearing wool. Amen.
[50:24] That's our job and the and the Lord has
[50:26] to do it. We're uh keenly aware of that.
[50:29] So, as I was saying, you know, earlier
[50:32] uh I think last night, pray for your
[50:34] pastors and your all the ministers
[50:36] because the the assault of the enemy is
[50:39] tremendous.
[50:41] And so, uh we we are all in this thing
[50:44] together. Amen. Genesis
[50:47] 15. I want to speak to you tonight on a
[50:50] title.
[50:51] Um, and I'm just going to take one this
[50:54] only this one piece from a small series
[50:57] I did at home and uh I'm going to take
[51:00] this title which is slightly different
[51:02] from what I took at home. I want to
[51:03] title it onward and upward and um the
[51:08] the home folk will probably understand
[51:10] just by that what part of the series I'm
[51:12] going to hit tonight. It's only just one
[51:14] fold of it. All right. So, we got a lot
[51:17] to stay say in the middle of it, but
[51:19] we're we're going to uh start and finish
[51:21] here by the help of the Lord. Amen.
[51:26] This is the third time that the Lord is
[51:30] going to have to give assurance to
[51:33] Abraham here, still called Abram because
[51:35] he hasn't had uh deity. The letter H is
[51:39] added to his name later. And H in the
[51:42] Hebrew is deity. And so, and then God's
[51:44] not just gonna not just going to add
[51:46] deity to his name, he's going to add it
[51:48] to his wife's name. And she's going to
[51:50] go from being Sarai to Sarah. And so,
[51:53] uh, how many want to have deity added?
[51:55] Amen. So, so I I may refer to this, and
[51:59] you may hear me saying Abraham. That's
[52:01] only because I'm speaking of of, um, uh,
[52:04] the predestined order of God. Amen. He
[52:07] was going to become Abraham. But this is
[52:09] the third time that God will have to
[52:11] come to him and give him the assurance.
[52:13] And we just want to lead in with this
[52:15] tonight. Verse one, Genesis 15. He had
[52:19] come to him already and called him in
[52:21] chapter 12. He came again in chapter 13.
[52:24] Told him, you know, your seed will be
[52:26] like the the the dust of the earth. You
[52:29] it be innumerable. I'm going to all the
[52:31] nations will be blessed in you. And God
[52:33] had already told him all these things.
[52:35] Now, you would think once God had told
[52:36] him all of that, he would never have a
[52:38] doubt. But here he is in chapter 15 and
[52:41] watch this. After these things, the word
[52:43] of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision,
[52:46] saying, "Fear not, Abram." See, I am thy
[52:50] shield and that exceeding great re
[52:52] reward. God already had his number. God
[52:54] already knew he was afraid. He was
[52:56] worried about circumstances that were
[52:59] and the circumstances argued against the
[53:01] promise that God had given him. And
[53:03] Abraham was falling for it. See, after
[53:06] these things, the word of the Lord came
[53:08] unto Abram in a vision, saying, "Fear
[53:11] not, Abram. I am thy shield and thy
[53:14] exceeding great reward." And Abram said,
[53:17] now here comes the complaint. It's a
[53:19] cat's going to get out of the bag right
[53:21] here. He might as well just say it. You
[53:22] can't hide it from the Lord anyway. And
[53:25] Abram said, "Lord God, what wilt thou
[53:27] give me?" What a
[53:29] question. I mean, hey, excuse me, son.
[53:32] Are you the same one I just told that
[53:34] all nations of the earth will be blessed
[53:36] in you? Are you that same guy? Am I the
[53:38] same God? Didn't I tell you it'd be like
[53:40] the the sand of the seashore, like the
[53:42] dust of the earth?
[53:45] Amen. Why are you afraid? See, and and
[53:48] and he said, "What wilt thou give me uh
[53:52] seeing I go childless, and the steward
[53:54] of my house is this Eleazar of
[53:57] Damascus?"
[53:58] And Abram said, "Behold, to me, thou has
[54:00] given no seed." And lo, one born in my
[54:04] house is mine heir. And behold, the word
[54:06] of the Lord came unto him, saying, This
[54:09] the third time, "This shall not be thine
[54:13] heir." But he that shall come forth out
[54:17] of thine own boughs shall be thine heir.
[54:21] And he brought him forth abroad, and
[54:23] said, "Look now toward heaven, and tell
[54:26] the stars, if thou be able to number
[54:29] them." And he said unto him, "So shall
[54:32] thy seed be." And he believed in the
[54:35] Lord, and he counted it to him for
[54:38] righteousness.
[54:39] And you're not going to see Abraham
[54:41] doubt that again. That's why the Bible
[54:44] doesn't claim that Abraham lived a
[54:46] flawless life. We can read in the book
[54:49] of Genesis that the famine came in the
[54:52] promised land and he left and went down
[54:54] to Egypt. And brother Brandham said
[54:55] anytime a Jew leaves the promised land,
[54:57] he's backslid. So we we know he got
[55:00] caught down there lying to Pharaoh. We
[55:03] know he almost got killed and almost
[55:05] lost his wife and picked up Hagar and
[55:07] and and I've said, "My goodness, Israel
[55:09] is still paying for that one to this
[55:11] day." And then he's caught later, you
[55:14] know, lying to Aimilec. Same old, same
[55:16] old. Uh, but I love it. Once once
[55:19] sunship was established, once once the
[55:21] promised son came on the scene, Abraham
[55:24] never did that again. He w and that's
[55:26] why Paul was Paul for Paul doesn't
[55:29] mention at all his human failures. He
[55:31] said he never staggered at the promise.
[55:38] See, let's pray.
[55:41] Master, we thank you for your word
[55:43] tonight. And I just relax myself, Lord,
[55:47] write readily and just ask you to take
[55:50] over the service. I have all kinds of
[55:52] notes laid out here that I believe
[55:54] inspired of you, but I will just follow
[55:56] your lead. Lord, we commit it to you.
[55:59] I'm just your servant. That's they sang.
[56:01] I walked I followed you out here. I'm
[56:04] just standing here to to be your
[56:06] assistant. I commit it to you, master,
[56:08] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You can
[56:11] be seated.
[56:19] And
[56:21] so this is God's third
[56:23] vision. He had came to him in chapter
[56:26] 12, chapter 13, and chapter 15. And I
[56:30] want to just move quickly over these
[56:32] opening points. And I'm going to have to
[56:33] be very studious tonight. So please give
[56:36] me your keen, undivided attention. We're
[56:39] going to have to move fast if we're
[56:40] going to cover everything and you can go
[56:43] back and get the archive for what you
[56:45] miss and but but stay paying attention
[56:48] or you'll get lost in transition just as
[56:51] sure as anything. So, we find one of the
[56:54] first points that I want to make and
[56:56] that I brought out at home was that, you
[56:59] know, sometimes we find ourselves
[57:02] questioning God. We know we had an
[57:04] experience with the Lord. We know it was
[57:05] him. We've already testified it was.
[57:08] We've already spent time thanking him
[57:10] for it. But sometimes circumstances will
[57:12] arise and we'll find ourselves doubting
[57:15] the very testimony. Now don't feel bad.
[57:17] John did the same thing. Testified,
[57:19] "Behold the lamb of God." And brother
[57:21] Brandham said, you know, he got in a
[57:22] circumstance. He got in prison and his
[57:24] eagle eyes got filmed over. Did you know
[57:26] that could happen to a prophet?
[57:29] And he said, "Hey, go ask him. You know,
[57:31] do is he actually the one I know what I
[57:33] said?" Yeah, I know what I saw. I'm not
[57:36] going to deny what I saw or what I said,
[57:37] but just go ask him, you know, is he the
[57:40] one or do we look for another? And I
[57:42] love it because Jesus, you know, when
[57:44] they came to Jesus and they said, you
[57:46] know, here's John's message. Are you
[57:47] really the one? And, you know, Jesus
[57:49] didn't, you know, pull out a business
[57:51] card and say, "Yeah, give this to John.
[57:52] Yes, I'm Jesus of Nazareth. My, you
[57:54] know, I lived here and I went to, you
[57:55] know, and this is all that." No, he
[57:57] didn't even he didn't, it's almost like
[57:58] he here's how he answered the question.
[58:00] Just go back to that word prophet and
[58:03] tell him the gospel is being preached
[58:04] and the lame are walking and the blind
[58:06] are seeing and great things are
[58:08] happening and everything that the word
[58:10] said would happen is happening. That's
[58:12] all you need to say. My prophet will get
[58:13] it. Just go tell him that. See, and so
[58:16] you you know we're we are the the the
[58:18] the testimony of Jesus Christ is the
[58:21] spirit of prophecy and we're the final
[58:24] voice to the final age because we have
[58:25] the testimony of Jesus Christ in a live
[58:28] life. And sometimes circumstance can
[58:30] even cause us to go my I don't know I
[58:32] thought well but I am not so sure. So
[58:34] you know what God did to Abram? He he
[58:37] finally had enough of this question and
[58:40] he takes Abram outside. He says son all
[58:43] right I've already told you all this.
[58:45] You've still got these questions. You're
[58:47] still worried about circumstances. So
[58:49] I'm going to have to put you in such an
[58:51] unreasonable situation. And God will do
[58:54] that. He'll let a trial or some kind of
[58:56] test come and you'll be in such an
[58:59] unreasonable situation. God took him out
[59:02] and said, "Look up there. Okay, now
[59:04] count those stars and give me the
[59:06] number."
[59:09] That was so unreasonable.
[59:11] And and God is saying to him, "Listen, I
[59:14] know the number. I need you to tell me.
[59:16] I know the number. You tell me the
[59:18] number. I know every one of them. I put
[59:20] them up there and I can tell you how
[59:22] many there are. Now, I want you to tell
[59:24] me, Lord, how that that's unreasonable.
[59:26] That's exactly my point, Abraham. I'm
[59:28] putting you in an unreasonable situation
[59:31] to get you to stop reasoning.
[59:34] [Applause]
[59:35] [Music]
[59:43] I don't understand why this is
[59:45] happening. If you just go back and trust
[59:48] him,
[59:49] [Music]
[59:53] he put him in an unreasonable he gave
[59:56] him an unreasonable task. Put him in an
[59:59] unreasonable situation to get him to
[1:00:02] stop reasoning.
[1:00:04] And so he's now he's going to deal with
[1:00:06] this whole this whole, you know, thing
[1:00:09] about, you know, this one born in your
[1:00:12] house. And I'm not here to cast shade on
[1:00:15] on Eleazar. And I and I know brother
[1:00:17] Brandham, the the Bible doesn't actually
[1:00:20] isn't clear whether this is the same
[1:00:22] Eleazar that went, but brother Brandham
[1:00:24] talks about that that was the one that
[1:00:26] went to get the fair Rebecca was
[1:00:27] Eleazar. stands to reason uh some B B B
[1:00:30] B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B
[1:00:30] B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B
[1:00:30] B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B Bible
[1:00:30] scholars suggest that it's certainly
[1:00:32] suggested in the Bible. This is the same
[1:00:34] guy. So, I'm not casting shade on that.
[1:00:36] I just want to use I want to make a
[1:00:38] certain type from a certain angle of the
[1:00:40] mountain tonight because you know you
[1:00:42] know you not that you are the uh built
[1:00:45] out of lively stones that you are the
[1:00:47] house of God's presence. Do you know?
[1:00:50] But you know what Paul said, you know,
[1:00:52] when I would do good, evil is present
[1:00:54] with me. I find then a law that in my
[1:00:57] members there's no good thing in that is
[1:01:00] in my flesh to will is present with me
[1:01:03] but but but I was born into a house a
[1:01:06] house that just is constantly
[1:01:08] disbelieving God a house that has
[1:01:10] weaknesses sometimes you know you you
[1:01:13] get weaknesses and it just maybe it come
[1:01:15] from the grabag of life as brother
[1:01:17] Brandon would talk about maybe maybe
[1:01:19] something came down upon you through
[1:01:21] heredity and maybe something jumped
[1:01:24] several generations and landed on you
[1:01:25] and you fight a battle over it and you
[1:01:27] got a problem with it and the devil
[1:01:29] knows what it is and and brother
[1:01:31] Brandham said we all got our weak spot
[1:01:33] and we got to keep our guard over it cuz
[1:01:34] Satan's always trying to get there. See,
[1:01:37] and so and so God and and the message to
[1:01:40] you tonight is listen, this is not your
[1:01:43] inheritance.
[1:01:45] There's another realm. There's another
[1:01:47] you that's down in your loins. This one
[1:01:51] born in your house is not. You're not
[1:01:53] going to have to bear that shame and
[1:01:55] bear that problem and bear that wound
[1:01:57] and bear that hurt. You're not going to
[1:01:59] have to fail at that anymore.
[1:02:04] I'm giving you a promise that you're
[1:02:05] going to overcome and someday that that
[1:02:09] which is in your loins, that gene of
[1:02:11] God, that is your inheritance.
[1:02:19] Beautiful. So if you think about it, the
[1:02:21] third thing that I want to point out is
[1:02:23] how did God why would God take him out?
[1:02:27] Not only as we've said to put him in an
[1:02:30] impossible situation, a totally
[1:02:32] unreasonable request. Tell me the number
[1:02:35] of stars, but if you think it through,
[1:02:39] what is God doing to give him his faith?
[1:02:42] The last thing he does is he looks up at
[1:02:45] the stars, which brother Brandham said
[1:02:48] was God's first Bible.
[1:02:51] And I'm here to tell you that Bible
[1:02:53] wasn't going to change. It already had
[1:02:56] the Virgin. It already had the
[1:02:57] crossfishes. It already had Leo the
[1:02:59] Lion. It already had a king and a queen.
[1:03:02] And he said, "Look up at the original
[1:03:04] word. If you doubt your circumstances,
[1:03:07] look at the original word.
[1:03:11] It's never going to change or be
[1:03:14] altered. And it already sees Abraham,
[1:03:17] that word already sees a kingdom and
[1:03:18] you're the father of it. It already sees
[1:03:21] a seed line, a Christ line going down
[1:03:24] through the ages. Don't worry, I've got
[1:03:27] the whole world in my hands.
[1:03:30] That's right.
[1:03:32] What God needed Abraham to do. And here
[1:03:35] here's what I here's a I said all of
[1:03:38] that to say this. What God needed
[1:03:41] Abraham to do was just keep going.
[1:03:48] Amen. Don't let circumstances stop you
[1:03:52] and cause you to come short of the
[1:03:54] promise. Go forward.
[1:03:57] Because forward is onward. See? And
[1:04:01] onward is upward.
[1:04:04] See that? This is what brother Brandham
[1:04:06] saw when he saw the preview of the
[1:04:08] bride. He said, you know, he was
[1:04:10] standing there. He saw him come by and
[1:04:11] everything's great. And then and then he
[1:04:13] saw the the the the the harlot church
[1:04:16] coming by. Oh, he's humiliated. He's
[1:04:19] embarrassed. He's he's his his face is
[1:04:22] burning. He the Lord is standing there
[1:04:24] and he oh, he just wants to die. He
[1:04:26] said, I just want to get away from here.
[1:04:28] I don't want to be here anymore. He said
[1:04:30] to think all of our effort and this is
[1:04:32] the best we could do for him. And and he
[1:04:34] said, "And then here come the Church of
[1:04:36] America." And he said, "They just kept
[1:04:37] getting worse and worse as they come.
[1:04:39] And finally, she's she's dressed
[1:04:41] vulgarly. Hardly got anything on. She's
[1:04:45] following a witch. She's dancing to rock
[1:04:48] and roll." And and Brother Brandham just
[1:04:50] he says, "Oh, I just wanted to be
[1:04:52] anywhere but right there." And then he
[1:04:54] says, and then he heard a voice say, and
[1:04:56] and brother Brandham says, "Now, as they
[1:04:59] went, as they went out, he said, the
[1:05:02] most awful screams you ever heard as
[1:05:06] they went off the edge and plunged."
[1:05:09] See, and those awful screams. And here
[1:05:11] he he just feeling it's the end of I
[1:05:14] just I don't even want to be alive. And
[1:05:16] he said the the the voice said, "The
[1:05:19] bride must come into view again because
[1:05:22] it was an alpha." And then it had to be
[1:05:24] an omega.
[1:05:26] And he said, "Here come that sainted
[1:05:28] bunch of little girls, all smooth,
[1:05:31] clean." And he said, "They were marching
[1:05:34] to the step of the gospel. They were
[1:05:37] following the sheet music. They were in
[1:05:39] time. They were in rhythm. They were
[1:05:42] marching onward. Christian soldiers and
[1:05:45] he and two or three of them at the end
[1:05:47] of the line started getting out of step
[1:05:49] and he's screaming stay in line and he
[1:05:52] says when I came out of it he said they
[1:05:54] were hurrying trying to get back in step
[1:05:57] and and I've said before that even
[1:06:00] though they were getting out of step and
[1:06:01] brother Brandham said instead of going
[1:06:03] down they started going up even though
[1:06:05] they were getting out of step they were
[1:06:07] still going upise
[1:06:10] [Music]
[1:06:12] their life wasn't perfect. They're
[1:06:14] they're they're they're still fighting
[1:06:16] the the greatest battle ever fought.
[1:06:18] Come on, aren't we?
[1:06:20] It's an epic battle that's been going,
[1:06:23] you know, since since before time. And
[1:06:26] uh you know, when when Lucifer and his
[1:06:28] angels fought Michael and his angels for
[1:06:30] control, and that didn't end well for
[1:06:32] him, and and he was booted out. But that
[1:06:34] battle spilled over into the earth.
[1:06:37] And brother Brandham says it's a battle
[1:06:39] for control of the mind of man. Amen. So
[1:06:43] the the so the the word is keep going
[1:06:48] onward. Amen. So you got to go forward.
[1:06:53] And if you go forward, you're going
[1:06:56] onward.
[1:06:57] And if you're going onward, you're going
[1:07:00] upward.
[1:07:03] You can't make it all happen. All you
[1:07:05] can do is obey the word. But the message
[1:07:08] is keep going forward. Don't stop. Don't
[1:07:12] lag behind. Whatever you do, don't turn
[1:07:14] around. And whatever you do, don't stand
[1:07:17] still on a moving treadmill. That's
[1:07:19] right.
[1:07:22] Cuz you'll go backwards if you stop. And
[1:07:25] that's what's happening to the earth.
[1:07:27] It's plunging off. There's a moving
[1:07:29] sidewalk plunging off. And if you stop
[1:07:31] and you linger, you're you say, "Oh, I I
[1:07:34] I didn't backslide." If you stop, the
[1:07:36] world is plunging more and more into
[1:07:38] sin. If you just stop going forward,
[1:07:41] you'll start backsliding.
[1:07:50] God would make he would go on
[1:07:53] to and here he would make an a a
[1:07:56] covenant with his with his faith
[1:08:00] seed. And it would, as Paul said, not
[1:08:03] seeds many, but seeds singular. That's
[1:08:05] right. So it was an unconditional
[1:08:08] covenant and he could not break it.
[1:08:11] Brother Brandham says God would have
[1:08:13] never gave Abraham he never gave any
[1:08:15] man. He never gave Abraham that kind of
[1:08:17] a covenant. Are you kidding me?
[1:08:19] Unconditional. That's right. Yeah. He
[1:08:21] said he did. He did. He wasn't even
[1:08:23] there to tell Abraham what I'm going to
[1:08:24] do. He was there to tell Abraham what
[1:08:26] he'd already done. I've already done it.
[1:08:29] It's already in the stars. I've already
[1:08:30] wrote it. It's already in the Bible.
[1:08:33] That's not going to change. Those
[1:08:34] planets aren't that's not going to
[1:08:35] change what I've already written there.
[1:08:37] And that's what's going to happen.
[1:08:38] Enoch's Bible agreed with that Bible.
[1:08:40] This Bible agrees with both of those
[1:08:42] Bibles. The message of the hour agrees
[1:08:45] with this Bible. Agrees with Enoch's
[1:08:46] Bible agrees with God's Bible.
[1:08:49] Hallelujah. You believe that?
[1:08:52] And our lives are a a representation of
[1:08:55] God's eternal word. Amen.
[1:08:58] So he said he would have never gave
[1:09:00] Abraham that kind of unconditional
[1:09:02] covenant, but he knew Abraham would
[1:09:04] believe it. And so it is a covenant with
[1:09:07] his faith seed. It was unconditional. He
[1:09:11] couldn't break it. Even even when the
[1:09:13] generations following Abraham uh
[1:09:17] stumbled and fell uh and and there was
[1:09:20] no hope, whenever they had less than no
[1:09:24] chance, God would send a a judge. God
[1:09:27] would send a a redeemer. God would send
[1:09:30] a savior. Said he sent saviors plural.
[1:09:33] And so uh a redeemer would step forward.
[1:09:37] Sin of God, he would come on the scene.
[1:09:40] And you know it was never going to be
[1:09:42] about seeds as many. It was going always
[1:09:46] going to be about a singular seed
[1:09:49] and that was Christ. It would be a faith
[1:09:52] seed. It would be the heritage of the
[1:09:54] Lord. It would be his family, his
[1:09:57] kingdom that proceeded from his loins.
[1:10:00] That's right.
[1:10:02] Election taught in the
[1:10:04] Bible is always has always been and
[1:10:08] shall always be based upon origin. As
[1:10:13] Jesus said, I came from God. I go back
[1:10:16] to God. He said in St. John 13, Jesus
[1:10:20] knowing that the Father had given him
[1:10:21] all things, that he was come from God
[1:10:23] and went to God, laid aside his garment.
[1:10:25] See, and then later on he he says it
[1:10:27] again a couple chapters later. And so we
[1:10:30] realize its origin because it's not
[1:10:32] about a lottery. It's not about any many
[1:10:34] mighty mo. It's not you got lucky. It's
[1:10:36] not you got fortunate. Even when he
[1:10:39] there in Matthew 16 when he says, "Who
[1:10:41] do men say that I, the son of man, am?"
[1:10:43] Well, Lord, some say you're Elias, some
[1:10:46] say Jeremiah, some say, "Okay, okay,
[1:10:48] okay. Who do you say I am?" Oh, well,
[1:10:51] thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:10:53] living God. Amen. And Jesus says to him,
[1:10:57] "Blessed art thou, Simon." Flesh and
[1:11:00] blood didn't reveal that to you. See,
[1:11:02] you can't track that through genealogy.
[1:11:04] It's not about that. Jesus looked at at
[1:11:06] at Jews and they said, "We be Abraham's
[1:11:10] children." And Jesus did not argue with
[1:11:12] that as if it would have done him any
[1:11:14] good anyway because they could go and
[1:11:16] bring out their family tree. My daddy,
[1:11:18] his daddy, his daddy, his daddy, his
[1:11:19] daddy, his daddy, Abraham. Yeah. And so
[1:11:22] he said, and he even said, "I know
[1:11:24] you're Abraham's seed. I know you're
[1:11:26] Abraham's children, but but we got a
[1:11:28] problem, boys. What you're doing,
[1:11:31] Abraham didn't do that."
[1:11:33] And and and you're you hate me. Abraham
[1:11:36] rejoiced to see my day. Here's what it
[1:11:40] happens, fellas. I know you might be the
[1:11:42] seeds of Abraham, but it was never going
[1:11:45] to be about seeds. It was going to be a
[1:11:48] singular faith seed. You are of your
[1:11:51] father with your with your family tree.
[1:11:54] You're of your father, the devil, and
[1:11:56] his deeds.
[1:11:58] You do.
[1:12:00] That's correct. He was a murderer and a
[1:12:02] liar from the beginning.
[1:12:05] See, so, so, so we find then that he's
[1:12:09] saying to Peter, blessed art thou. And
[1:12:12] the the last thing in the world in the
[1:12:14] Greek that that means is fortunate or
[1:12:16] lucky. He's not saying to Peter for
[1:12:18] that's pretty fortunate Peter that you
[1:12:19] see who I am. What he's literally using
[1:12:22] is a is a Greek word and I I pulled this
[1:12:24] note from Dr. Spirit Zodiatis in his in
[1:12:27] his Greek key study Greek Hebrew case
[1:12:29] study Bible just to give you the
[1:12:31] reference and he these are actually his
[1:12:34] words. He said it he said he said it's
[1:12:37] unfortunate that sometimes this word
[1:12:41] mccarius which in the Bible says blessed
[1:12:44] art thou that sometimes that he said it
[1:12:48] gets it gets translated as fortunate. He
[1:12:51] said it doesn't mean that at all. He
[1:12:53] said here's what it literally means
[1:12:55] possessing the characteristic of deity.
[1:13:00] Hallelujah.
[1:13:02] So Jesus isn't saying Peter you lucky
[1:13:05] rascal. No he's saying Peter there's
[1:13:08] something inside you that's also inside
[1:13:10] of me and that's how you know who I am.
[1:13:13] We have the same father and that's how I
[1:13:15] say thou art Peter and upon this
[1:13:18] reality.
[1:13:20] This revelation of faith in who you are
[1:13:23] and who I am.
[1:13:25] I'll build my whole kingdom on that. It
[1:13:28] won't be about their ups and downs or
[1:13:30] their wins and losses column. That's not
[1:13:32] going to be about that. It's a faith
[1:13:34] generation.
[1:13:37] Glory to God. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:39] Hallelujah.
[1:13:42] So, it was a seed line that would
[1:13:44] journey through the Bible. You can track
[1:13:46] it
[1:13:48] all the way through the Bible. You can
[1:13:49] see that seed line traveling through the
[1:13:51] Bible. And they had this son and married
[1:13:54] this woman and this son. and then they
[1:13:55] had this child and and a lot of times
[1:13:57] you'll see that and it'll just go down
[1:13:58] three or four generations down and then
[1:14:00] just peter out. You don't you don't hear
[1:14:01] about it. You don't even know what
[1:14:02] happened to them. Another one will do
[1:14:04] the same thing. This one married this
[1:14:06] one of this land and they had forth and
[1:14:08] brought forth a son who married a one of
[1:14:10] this land and it'll go ding ding ding
[1:14:11] ding and then that's it. But then every
[1:14:13] once in a while you come on one it says
[1:14:15] and and had this son and this son
[1:14:17] married this one and had this son and
[1:14:18] that married and had this son and it
[1:14:20] goes all the way from Abraham to David
[1:14:22] and all the way from David to Christ and
[1:14:24] and Matthew's able to actually track it
[1:14:26] backwards. Oh friends, I'm here to tell
[1:14:28] you there's a seed line of God's word
[1:14:30] that proceeded out of God is part of God
[1:14:34] came from God going back to God.
[1:14:39] Thank you. See? So, so and God is not
[1:14:44] diminished. Not at all. No matter how
[1:14:47] much pride he expresses, he's never
[1:14:48] diminished.
[1:14:50] Adam, you know, I love Brother Chad's
[1:14:52] sermon today. Adam, Adam wasn't
[1:14:55] diminished when the feminist spirit was
[1:14:58] taken out of him. It was just living in
[1:14:59] another person.
[1:15:01] Adam, it was still named Adam. Adam
[1:15:03] wasn't diminished. Amen.
[1:15:06] I'm here to tell you when God listen did
[1:15:08] you know that even actually uh speaking
[1:15:11] in medical science knows that actually
[1:15:13] the rib is one of the very rare human
[1:15:17] bones that if you remove it it'll it'll
[1:15:19] re recreate itself.
[1:15:22] So there's actually no missing rib in
[1:15:24] that sense. And when God took the rib
[1:15:27] out of Adam he got another another rib
[1:15:29] grew back. It's one of the very few
[1:15:30] bones in your whole body, just your rib
[1:15:33] and one or two other little places that
[1:15:35] will actually, but the rib is the
[1:15:36] predominant one that'll actually if it
[1:15:39] if it's if it's removed correctly and
[1:15:41] certain part of it are still in place,
[1:15:43] it has its own little factory and it'll
[1:15:44] re rebuild itself. See? So, so, so even
[1:15:48] when he gave her a rib, he wasn't
[1:15:50] diminished. I'm here to tell you
[1:15:52] something, friends. When God laid aside
[1:15:55] his glory and took upon him the form of
[1:15:59] sinful man, when Jesus came to the
[1:16:01] earth, he wasn't diminished in deity. He
[1:16:04] wasn't missing any deity. And when he
[1:16:06] raised up out of the tomb, he wasn't
[1:16:08] missing any humanity. He was still the
[1:16:10] full God man. And when God came on the
[1:16:13] day of Pentecost and divided himself in
[1:16:16] the upper room, God wasn't diminished.
[1:16:19] Heaven didn't lose the glory of Almighty
[1:16:21] God when he was living in his family.
[1:16:26] Oh my. It's all Mr. and Mrs. Jesus
[1:16:29] Christ.
[1:16:36] Hallelujah.
[1:16:43] So, we're going to invite you to Isaiah
[1:16:45] 59.
[1:16:47] Isaiah
[1:16:48] 59. Lovely chapter. Rather ominous, but
[1:16:52] it has a good ending.
[1:16:56] All is well that ends well.
[1:17:01] Isaiah 59. And it's it's going to be a
[1:17:05] place where
[1:17:07] um you know, God is going to reprove
[1:17:10] Israel. And uh it gets pretty dicey and
[1:17:13] you're you're not even sure if Israel's
[1:17:14] going to survive it. Uh but but they do
[1:17:18] and uh the Lord's not going to lose his
[1:17:20] own. Amen.
[1:17:24] So when we but just just you just hold
[1:17:27] your your spot there in Isa in Isaiah 59
[1:17:30] and we'll come to it just shortly. Let
[1:17:31] me just make a few introductory
[1:17:35] comments. All right. So now well excuse
[1:17:38] me. Okay. Get where I need to be.
[1:17:41] So when we think about Isaiah reproving
[1:17:44] Israel, you got to realize something
[1:17:47] that that prophets are never trying to
[1:17:50] be popular.
[1:17:55] That's not why they come.
[1:17:58] Prophets, the the the chief reason that
[1:18:01] a prophet comes is to identify and
[1:18:06] conduct you into the presence of God.
[1:18:10] and and that's why and and and and the
[1:18:13] the ministry of a of a son of man as a
[1:18:16] prophet that in itself is a ministry of
[1:18:19] atonement. For instance, I'll give you
[1:18:21] for instance you you can see where where
[1:18:24] where where God said you know um you
[1:18:28] know Moses come up into the mountain and
[1:18:30] there was the shikina glory. The
[1:18:32] mountain was on fire and now God, you
[1:18:35] know, God had already told him, "Now
[1:18:37] make sure you build a barrier around the
[1:18:38] bottom of this mountain. If even an
[1:18:40] animal touch it, you have to kill him."
[1:18:42] See, cuz nothing like that can come into
[1:18:44] my presence. See? And so, so and in fact
[1:18:47] is the priest Aaron. Aaron although he
[1:18:50] was called by thus sayeth the Lord, he
[1:18:53] had a divine call. He he could go in, he
[1:18:56] could have everything, his garment be
[1:18:58] perfect, everything in in order, the the
[1:19:01] tabernacle in the wilderness just so.
[1:19:03] But do you know that if he walked in
[1:19:04] there, even though it was the day of
[1:19:06] atonement and even though God told him
[1:19:07] to go in and do it and sacrifice for the
[1:19:09] people, if he went in there without
[1:19:11] blood, he died,
[1:19:13] cuz he could not go into the shikina
[1:19:16] glory without a blood sacrifice. But you
[1:19:19] find that Moses went in and out of the
[1:19:21] shikina. Gloria, never killed a lamb,
[1:19:23] never took blood, never did anything.
[1:19:26] See, and then and then finally God says
[1:19:29] to Moses, "Now go down there and and
[1:19:31] tell the people, don't don't break
[1:19:33] through unto me. You'll have to wipe
[1:19:34] them out." I mean, he had already he
[1:19:36] already said to Moses, "Listen, Moses, I
[1:19:38] cannot dwell among you because this is
[1:19:40] stiff necked people and I you know, I'd
[1:19:42] kill everybody and so I cannot dwell
[1:19:44] among you. So I'll send my angel and he
[1:19:47] will dwell among you. See, so so that's
[1:19:50] that's a redemption working there.
[1:19:52] That's a that's a ministry of atonement
[1:19:54] for the people. See, and and so so we
[1:19:57] find then that it gives them something
[1:19:59] in between a holy God, something in the
[1:20:02] middle between a holy God and a sinful
[1:20:04] people. Amen. And so just like the blood
[1:20:07] ring around the earth. And that's why
[1:20:08] God can't see the sin of the earth cuz
[1:20:10] you're here and you're the blood of God
[1:20:13] by the spirit.
[1:20:15] See? Amen. And so we're not talk.
[1:20:18] Brother Brandham said, "Not the
[1:20:19] chemistry." Nobody's got that. People
[1:20:22] say, "Oh, I'm covered by the blood." And
[1:20:24] what does that mean? Well, uh, I'm
[1:20:26] covered by the blood. Okay, but what
[1:20:28] does that mean? Do you got blood? Do Do
[1:20:31] does the Vatican have a vial of his
[1:20:33] blood? Is it in Jerusalem somewhere? Do
[1:20:35] you got it? Anybody got a vial of of the
[1:20:37] blood of Jesus? Do you know that if you
[1:20:39] did, you'd be more valuable than that?
[1:20:43] Because he sacrificed that blood to save
[1:20:45] you.
[1:20:46] Yes, sir. See? So, so that's this is why
[1:20:49] brother Brandon would call it a bleeding
[1:20:52] word. See, this is why the unwise
[1:20:55] virgin, this is why she goes through the
[1:20:56] tribulation for a sin of unbelief. She
[1:20:58] she rejected the atonement of the
[1:21:01] bleeding word in the message of the hour
[1:21:03] that she could have had faith in and it
[1:21:04] would have atoned for her. That's right.
[1:21:06] But she rejected it. So she's got to go
[1:21:08] into the tribulation and pay the price
[1:21:10] for that. Absolutely. Oh my. I can't get
[1:21:13] sidetracked. So So we find then that
[1:21:16] that he he says, you know, tell them
[1:21:19] don't let anybody break through on me.
[1:21:22] No, Lord. We don't uh we we build a
[1:21:24] fence. Moses, go down there and warn
[1:21:26] them. Yeah, Lord. We we did we built a
[1:21:28] fence. We've already told them. Moses,
[1:21:30] go back down and make this is important.
[1:21:34] Go tell them. Don't anyone try to come
[1:21:36] into my presence without a blood
[1:21:38] sacrifice. That's the reason people die
[1:21:41] today trying to break into the presence
[1:21:44] of God without a bleeding word of faith
[1:21:46] to have. There's no way. Listen friends,
[1:21:49] you can go to a Benny Hen uh church
[1:21:52] service and you can get the anointing of
[1:21:54] Jesus. You can pay your tithes and get
[1:21:57] the blessing of the Lord, but in order
[1:22:00] to get the presence of God, you've going
[1:22:03] to have to have a prophet. Because a
[1:22:05] prophet is a ministry of atonement to
[1:22:08] conduct you into the living presence of
[1:22:11] God.
[1:22:13] Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:16] And and Moses hurries to go down and the
[1:22:18] Lord calls back to him, "Oh, Moses, by
[1:22:20] the way, when you come back, bring
[1:22:22] Aaron." And when he brought Aaron, they
[1:22:24] didn't bring a lamb. They didn't take
[1:22:26] any blood. They didn't do anything. He
[1:22:27] just walked Aaron right into the shakina
[1:22:29] glory. And Aaron didn't die cuz he was
[1:22:31] with Moses.
[1:22:34] And he's under the umbrella of that
[1:22:35] prophetic ministry. He's under the
[1:22:38] umbrella of that son of man. He's under
[1:22:40] the umbrella of the atoning. Oh,
[1:22:42] hallelujah, friends.
[1:22:49] So now comes a prophet to reprove
[1:22:53] Israel and
[1:22:55] he he he he's going to judge the case
[1:22:59] when we come to Isaiah
[1:23:03] 59. The heritage of the Lord was in
[1:23:06] trouble when God came down with his
[1:23:09] prophet to judge the case. Because
[1:23:11] brother Brandham taught us that prophets
[1:23:13] indict the people in the presence of the
[1:23:16] judge.
[1:23:19] When they stepped forward, when that
[1:23:21] prophet stepped forward to examine the
[1:23:23] matter, he found Jehovah's bride in a
[1:23:27] catastrophe.
[1:23:30] And he's not going to hold back or pull
[1:23:32] any punches. He's going to give it to
[1:23:35] them straight. He's not trying to be
[1:23:37] popular. He's going to defend the honor
[1:23:41] of God by telling you the unvarnished
[1:23:45] truth. You can rely on a true prophet of
[1:23:49] God. Now, he's a true prophet because he
[1:23:54] only brings the word of God. He might be
[1:23:56] a real prophet, but not a true prophet.
[1:23:59] Balam was a real prophet, but he was a
[1:24:02] false prophet because he brought a false
[1:24:05] doctrine, though he was a real prophet.
[1:24:07] So, it's not just a real prophet. I want
[1:24:10] a true prophet who'll tell me the truth.
[1:24:13] How about it, friends? I want a prophet
[1:24:15] who's not going to pull any punches. I
[1:24:17] want somebody who can guarantee me that
[1:24:19] someday I can behold the face of my
[1:24:21] beloved, that I can stand around
[1:24:24] father's throne and sing and rejoice. I
[1:24:26] don't want to take any shortcuts. Amen.
[1:24:29] Absolutely.
[1:24:33] He's going to defend the honor of God.
[1:24:35] That's you see that. See, because th
[1:24:38] this is the heritage just like you know
[1:24:40] just like Psalms 127s that children are
[1:24:43] the heritage of the Lord and a man is
[1:24:46] very happy if he has his quiver full of
[1:24:48] them. And the Bible says that they will
[1:24:52] speak to the enemies in the gate. In the
[1:24:53] east the gate was the place of judgment.
[1:24:56] The scene there of Psalms 127 is a
[1:24:59] father who has been falsely accused of
[1:25:02] doing something contrary to God's law,
[1:25:05] that he's a secret sinner. And so the
[1:25:08] trial is gathered. They're in they're at
[1:25:10] the gate and there's false witnesses who
[1:25:12] are there to tell a lie about this
[1:25:14] honorable father. But the beauty of it
[1:25:17] is the reason that that happy is the man
[1:25:20] who hath his quiver filled with the
[1:25:22] heritage of the Lord is he won't even
[1:25:25] have to take the stand. His children
[1:25:27] will testify for him. He won't have to
[1:25:29] open his mouth. He won't have to say a
[1:25:31] word. Listen, God doesn't say he doesn't
[1:25:33] have to say anything to this world. You
[1:25:35] are his defense.
[1:25:37] Hallelujah. Your lived life is a
[1:25:39] testimony. God's word is true. And the
[1:25:42] world has lied on God and lied on the
[1:25:45] message. But we see the the blind see
[1:25:48] and the deaf hear and the lame walk and
[1:25:50] the people are filled with the spirit of
[1:25:52] God and we are here to testify.
[1:25:58] That's the whole reason brother Brandon
[1:26:00] preaches a trial and he says I'm going
[1:26:02] to give the Lord a new trial. He said he
[1:26:06] did not get a fair trial in his first
[1:26:08] coming. I'm going to give him another
[1:26:09] one tonight. Oh, they say he doesn't
[1:26:12] keep his word. That's a lie. They say he
[1:26:15] can't trust him. That's a lie. I'm here
[1:26:17] to tell you, I'm a living testimony.
[1:26:19] You're a living testimony. You're the
[1:26:22] heritage of the Lord.
[1:26:26] [Music]
[1:26:30] They claim he's the second person of a
[1:26:33] trinity, and that's not true. They claim
[1:26:36] the days of miracles are passed, but
[1:26:38] that's not true.
[1:26:40] They claim you can compromise his work.
[1:26:42] That's not true.
[1:26:46] Jesus doesn't keep his promises. That's
[1:26:48] not true. Amen. Amen. So, it is the
[1:26:52] children and their character, their life
[1:26:54] on display that has proven that the
[1:26:57] father has been lied on because in the
[1:26:59] Hebrew, when you read it from the Hebrew
[1:27:00] text, it's a victorious. When it says
[1:27:03] they shall speak to the men in the gate,
[1:27:06] these false witnesses, it means they
[1:27:07] will contend with them victoriously.
[1:27:10] They will put them to silence because
[1:27:11] when they'll walk up and they'll say,
[1:27:13] "Examine my life. If you want to know
[1:27:14] what kind of father I got, examine my
[1:27:16] life. If you want to know what this
[1:27:19] message is, can you say that tonight?
[1:27:21] Can you say to a world that doesn't
[1:27:23] believe that the message of the hour is
[1:27:24] true?" Can you just say, "Come, come
[1:27:26] stay at my house a few days. Come go
[1:27:28] with me to church on Sunday and then
[1:27:30] tell me it's not true." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:27:32] God keeps his word and he's here to
[1:27:34] prove it.
[1:27:38] Amen. Praise God.
[1:27:41] He keeps all of his promises and we are
[1:27:44] the living evidence of that.
[1:27:48] So he says here verse
[1:27:51] one of Isaiah 59. I'm just going to read
[1:27:54] some selected verses. Behold the Lord's
[1:27:56] hand is not
[1:27:57] shortened that it cannot save neither
[1:28:01] his ear heavy that it cannot
[1:28:05] hear. Here's the problem.
[1:28:07] Israel, your iniquities have separated
[1:28:10] between you and your God. The problem's
[1:28:13] not in God. Problem's not in his word.
[1:28:16] Your sins have hid his face from you
[1:28:18] that he will not hear. See, so you know,
[1:28:23] people say, "Oh, how dare William
[1:28:25] Brandham to say that if a woman cuts her
[1:28:27] hair, God won't even hear her prayers."
[1:28:29] Like, as if this is not in the Bible.
[1:28:32] You you put sin in between you and God,
[1:28:34] he doesn't hear your prayers.
[1:28:38] They they sometimes I wonder what they
[1:28:39] think. You know, they don't understand
[1:28:41] William Brandon was a word prophet. He
[1:28:43] didn't pull these things out of thin
[1:28:44] air. There's no doctrine that can't be
[1:28:46] supported in this Bible. And every
[1:28:48] doctrine we have is evidently proven and
[1:28:51] can't be dis disproven. Not not using
[1:28:53] your Bible. That's right. If you're
[1:28:55] going to try to disprove the message,
[1:28:56] you better bring something beside your
[1:28:57] Bible. Praise God. Cuz it's all through
[1:29:01] it. He warned them. He told them that
[1:29:04] that that you're mistakenly you think
[1:29:07] you're worshiping God when you go to
[1:29:10] church on Sunday just because you read
[1:29:11] out of a Bible and sing out of a himnil
[1:29:13] and you've got a robe choir and you do
[1:29:15] all kinds of televangelism and you think
[1:29:17] you're worshiping God. What you don't
[1:29:19] know is you're worshiping the devil.
[1:29:24] You're worshiping the God of this evil
[1:29:26] age. And that's exactly scripture
[1:29:28] because that's what the Lord did for
[1:29:30] Israel. He finally told them, "I'm going
[1:29:32] to bring you're going to have to bring
[1:29:34] your offering to the door." And and if
[1:29:37] you But I'm going to He says, "I'm going
[1:29:38] to keep you from worshiping out there
[1:29:41] cuz that's worshiping devils. If you
[1:29:43] want to have there's one access to
[1:29:45] worship, there's only one provided place
[1:29:47] of worship and that's the door. And the
[1:29:50] door is Christ and Christ is his word."
[1:29:53] And if you're not worshiping at the
[1:29:55] door, you're worshiping in the
[1:29:56] wilderness worshiping
[1:29:58] devils.
[1:30:03] Verse four, none calleth for
[1:30:06] justice. This is a
[1:30:09] catastrophe. None calleth for justice,
[1:30:11] nor any pleadithth for truth. They trust
[1:30:15] in vanity. They speak lies. They
[1:30:17] conceive mischief and bring forth
[1:30:20] iniquity. It's quite an indictment.
[1:30:23] Yeah. Verse seven, their feet run to
[1:30:28] evil. They make haste to shed innocent
[1:30:31] blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of
[1:30:33] iniquity. Wasting and destruction are in
[1:30:36] their paths. Verse 10. We grope for the
[1:30:39] walls like the blind. And we grope as if
[1:30:42] we had no eyes. We stumble at noonday as
[1:30:44] in the as in the night. We are in
[1:30:47] desolate places as dead men. Verse 13.
[1:30:52] in transgressing and lying against the
[1:30:54] Lord and departing away from our God,
[1:30:57] speaking oppression and revolt,
[1:31:00] conceiving and uttering from the heart
[1:31:02] words of falsehood.
[1:31:04] Verse 14, judgment is turned away
[1:31:06] backward. And is this is this an
[1:31:08] indictment of the age we live in or
[1:31:10] what?
[1:31:12] Justice is turned judgment is turned
[1:31:14] away backward and justice standeth a far
[1:31:16] off for truth is fallen in the street
[1:31:19] and equity cannot enter. Yay, truth
[1:31:22] faileth, and he that departeth from evil
[1:31:24] maketh himself a prey. And the Lord saw
[1:31:28] it, and it displeased him that there was
[1:31:32] no
[1:31:33] judgment. No one's doing anything about
[1:31:35] this. This is a terrible there.
[1:31:38] Something's got to be done. And and it
[1:31:40] displeased God. And he he he saw that
[1:31:44] and wondered, "How is there no
[1:31:45] intercessor?" You know, and he says, and
[1:31:48] he and in verse 16, "And he saw that
[1:31:50] there was no man and wondered that there
[1:31:53] was no
[1:31:54] intercessor. Therefore, his arm brought
[1:31:57] salvation unto him, and his
[1:32:00] righteousness it sustained him." Thank
[1:32:03] you, Lord.
[1:32:07] Whoops. So, when we look at it from this
[1:32:11] perspective, we find examples of a
[1:32:14] redeemer.
[1:32:16] You can find them all through the Bible.
[1:32:18] David was the was the the if you if you
[1:32:21] follow these things along in the Hebrew,
[1:32:23] you you find and and this comes from
[1:32:25] years of just looking at at key study
[1:32:27] words uh there and you find that when
[1:32:30] David stepped out that he was actually
[1:32:33] became the man in the middle. Israel was
[1:32:37] here and nobody would go forward and the
[1:32:40] enemy was there and one giant stepped
[1:32:42] forward and came into the middle to
[1:32:44] challenge and he said send me a man and
[1:32:47] here David steps out. Nobody wants to do
[1:32:49] it. So David goes and stands between he
[1:32:54] the what no one knows is he's standing
[1:32:56] between the living and the dead. Those
[1:32:58] who are going to stay alive and those
[1:33:00] who are about to be killed. Yeah. Right.
[1:33:02] And he's standing there and Satan's
[1:33:04] there to challenge him. And he was he
[1:33:07] was uh he was the man in the middle who
[1:33:10] stood there like like a redeemer like a
[1:33:13] goeteen like standing in the gap.
[1:33:17] You can find Boaz. Brother Brandham
[1:33:19] talks about it in the preach. And he was
[1:33:20] the goel. He was he was the redeemer. He
[1:33:23] redeemed uh Naomi. And when he redeemed
[1:33:25] Naomi, he gets Ruth also. And and so he,
[1:33:29] you know, he's going to go to the
[1:33:30] judgment. And there he goes again the to
[1:33:32] the city gates and he calls forth a
[1:33:34] hearing and I want to have a hearing
[1:33:36] before the judges and here's a situation
[1:33:38] and he and he lays the whole thing out
[1:33:40] and the challenge is made to the nearer
[1:33:42] kinsmen because Satan is a near kinsman
[1:33:44] to your flesh. Your flesh is enmity
[1:33:47] against God. The human the mind fallen
[1:33:49] mind can't even agree with God's word
[1:33:51] unless God breaks in upon it. It's the
[1:33:54] mercy of God. It's not you figured it
[1:33:56] out. It's not you heard about true
[1:33:58] doctrine and you got convinced of it.
[1:34:00] the spirit of God broke in upon you and
[1:34:03] begin to draw you. And brother Brandham
[1:34:05] said, if he can get you to agree with
[1:34:06] his word, then that old nature gets
[1:34:08] annihilated and the new life comes up
[1:34:11] out of a gene of God and you're a
[1:34:12] living, breathing son and daughter of
[1:34:15] almighty God.
[1:34:17] Your whole nature is changed. Your whole
[1:34:19] thinking is changed.
[1:34:24] So we find all of these various
[1:34:26] examples. We talked about Moses there.
[1:34:29] where he was at, you know, standing in
[1:34:31] the gap. We'll get to it here in a
[1:34:33] little bit more. I want to cover it
[1:34:34] again. Go back to Moses. But we find
[1:34:36] that the authority
[1:34:39] uh a and and redemption and the the
[1:34:43] authority I want to say it like that. I
[1:34:45] want to say there's an authority in
[1:34:48] redemption. And there in order to have
[1:34:50] authority in redemption, you have to
[1:34:53] have authority in the redeemer.
[1:34:56] He has to be able. See, that's why that
[1:34:59] one could not and would not rescue uh
[1:35:02] Naomi because it would it would it would
[1:35:05] it would it he might lose all of his
[1:35:08] interest if he spent everything. He
[1:35:10] didn't have enough to live it up and
[1:35:13] serve God at the same time. So, he
[1:35:16] decided he wanted to have his own way.
[1:35:18] And when he did, um, boy, I said, "Fine,
[1:35:20] I'll take her because I got plenty of
[1:35:23] money and I got plenty of love and I'll
[1:35:26] take her and I'll take Ruth and I'll
[1:35:27] raise up children and I'll go all the
[1:35:30] way. I'm going to be a full complete
[1:35:31] redeemer." And once that happened, he
[1:35:34] had full faith and authority granted to
[1:35:37] him in the judgment. She's yours. Take
[1:35:39] her and and blessed be her, the fruit of
[1:35:42] her womb. And and and it went and it
[1:35:45] went forward. And there from there comes
[1:35:46] Jesse. from the Jesse comes David and it
[1:35:49] goes on and on and on to
[1:35:51] Christ. So redemption requires a
[1:35:54] redeemer and the redeemer requires
[1:35:57] authority so that he can decree. This is
[1:35:59] exactly why when Jesus was on Mount
[1:36:03] Transfiguration and you you good sir we
[1:36:06] good. It's only 7:30. All right. We
[1:36:08] good?
[1:36:09] Have I went 55 minutes yet?
[1:36:13] So here he is on mount trans
[1:36:15] transfiguration and he's transfigured
[1:36:17] before him and a voice speaks. Now
[1:36:19] interestingly enough it's the same voice
[1:36:22] saying the same thing when he went into
[1:36:24] the water this is my beloved son. See in
[1:36:28] whom I'm pleased to dwell only now
[1:36:31] there's a difference. there's an
[1:36:33] addendum attached and he says hear ye
[1:36:36] him and brother Brandham takes that
[1:36:39] under divine inspiration and he says in
[1:36:41] other words because see a prophet's the
[1:36:43] only one who can give you the correct
[1:36:45] other words
[1:36:47] and get it right and you can have
[1:36:50] confidence in it because he's got
[1:36:51] authority and he and and he said this is
[1:36:54] my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to
[1:36:56] dwell here you him and brother Bradam
[1:36:58] said in other words the god said uh that
[1:37:02] that his that I will set down now his
[1:37:05] words are spirit and life.
[1:37:09] See, and so we find that when he
[1:37:11] ascended up on high, all power of
[1:37:15] redemption was vested in him. See, so so
[1:37:19] you're you've got to have an authority.
[1:37:22] You've got you can't just, you know, it
[1:37:24] can't just be anybody. For here's here's
[1:37:26] a for instance. When you look at uh when
[1:37:30] you look at in the book of Revelation
[1:37:33] and you see that you've got angels who
[1:37:36] are standing on the four winds of
[1:37:39] judgment and they've already been given
[1:37:41] a command and the woes are ready to
[1:37:43] come. Woe one, woe two, woe three. And
[1:37:46] it's literally they're going to be
[1:37:48] consecutive. They're not going to stop
[1:37:50] once they start. They're not going to
[1:37:51] stop. And they're going to go all the
[1:37:53] way until they literally sweep man off
[1:37:56] of the face of the earth. That's true.
[1:37:58] But now you remember when brother
[1:38:00] Brandham is in look away to Jesus and he
[1:38:04] says a very some curious things that we
[1:38:06] didn't understand in our infancy. We
[1:38:07] understand them a lot better now. And he
[1:38:10] says, "Now friends, you're going to see
[1:38:12] some strange things happen in the
[1:38:14] ministry." He said, "Now nothing's
[1:38:16] sinful. I don't mean that." He said,
[1:38:18] "But we're going to have to have some
[1:38:20] dropping back. We're going to have to
[1:38:22] drop back and wait for this other to
[1:38:24] catch up because we've seen the the five
[1:38:28] instances of the third pull. We've seen
[1:38:30] the spoken word. Oh my. The devil wanted
[1:38:34] that power so bad. He tried to coup in
[1:38:37] heaven to get it. He tried to he he does
[1:38:40] what he does in the Garden of Eden
[1:38:42] thinking he would get the book of life,
[1:38:44] but his filthy hands couldn't hold it
[1:38:45] and went back to the original owner.
[1:38:47] Thank
[1:38:48] God. Amen.
[1:38:51] And he he spent all of his thousands of
[1:38:54] years building up his kingdom. All to
[1:38:58] see at the very last a prophet, a little
[1:39:01] humble prophet comes on the scene and
[1:39:04] he's doing what even Jesus didn't do in
[1:39:08] his first incarnation. He's literally
[1:39:10] using Genesis power and he's creating
[1:39:13] something out of nothing. So that the
[1:39:16] things which you saw sitting on a limb
[1:39:18] called a squirrel were made of things
[1:39:20] that do not appear.
[1:39:24] What a slap that was to the devil after
[1:39:26] 6,000 years of trying to get that kind
[1:39:29] of power. And it's in the bride of Jesus
[1:39:32] Christ.
[1:39:35] He creates us. He creates an animal by
[1:39:37] speaking. He does it a second time. He
[1:39:40] he disappears a tumor by speaking. He
[1:39:42] rebukes a storm by speaking. He gives
[1:39:45] salvation to a mother's children by
[1:39:48] speaking.
[1:39:52] He gives a fish his life by speaking.
[1:39:58] Oh yeah. So you've got to have an
[1:40:02] authority to do that.
[1:40:04] You can't just do that. That's never
[1:40:06] been done.
[1:40:08] Not since Genesis have we seen that.
[1:40:11] Even Jesus didn't do that. Yeah. He He
[1:40:14] He took a fish out of a fish's a coin
[1:40:17] out of a fish's mouth and paid taxes. He
[1:40:19] took bread and and made more bread. He
[1:40:21] took fish and made more fish. But he
[1:40:23] never took and just spoke something into
[1:40:26] existence.
[1:40:28] But he did in our day.
[1:40:31] See?
[1:40:33] And so, Brother Brandham says, "Now, so,
[1:40:35] so the idea, the the the imagery that
[1:40:38] you realize is that because everything
[1:40:41] has to stay in sync." And if and I don't
[1:40:44] have time tonight, this is not a
[1:40:45] symposium on prophecy, so I don't have
[1:40:48] time to break break all down into the
[1:40:49] book of Revelation. But what you will
[1:40:51] notice is that is that the seals and the
[1:40:54] trumpets and the vials and the woes and
[1:40:56] brother Brandham said they all happen in
[1:40:58] a cluster and they're all happening
[1:41:01] succinctly and in order and one is
[1:41:03] overlaying the other one and you read
[1:41:04] the vials and the trumpets and they're
[1:41:06] almost identical and you realize one is
[1:41:08] to the Jews, one's to the Gentiles and
[1:41:11] the same thing that's happening here is
[1:41:12] happening over here and the vial is
[1:41:14] temporarily pouring out. Brother
[1:41:16] Brandham caught it under the seal, a
[1:41:17] temporary judgment because of rejection
[1:41:19] of the word. A messenger caught a
[1:41:21] revelation, ran with it, people
[1:41:23] gathered, and then God laid them asleep,
[1:41:24] took them home, they denominated it, and
[1:41:26] God said a temporary judgment fell. See,
[1:41:30] a temporary judgment. So, so we see
[1:41:33] these things breaking partially and
[1:41:35] they're all happening at the same time.
[1:41:37] And now you've got these
[1:41:39] angels and they've already been given
[1:41:42] the
[1:41:43] command. Go ahead, bring the winds of
[1:41:47] war. Bring the woes. It's never happened
[1:41:49] in the earth. There's been wars and
[1:41:52] rumors of wars and nation rising against
[1:41:54] nation, but there's never been a world
[1:41:56] war that embroils all of the civilized
[1:42:00] world and even third world countries and
[1:42:01] everything becomes involved in this
[1:42:03] titanic affair. And people think that
[1:42:05] was just some accident. Oh, you know,
[1:42:08] Ferdinand gets assassinated and none of
[1:42:10] the monarchs want to go to war, but they
[1:42:12] can't stop it. And and Wilham's writing
[1:42:15] letters and, you know, to George and
[1:42:17] George, they're cousins and George is
[1:42:18] writing letters to him and they're
[1:42:20] writing letters to to Nicholas and
[1:42:22] Nicholas is writing to the Austrians.
[1:42:24] Come on, fellas. Uh, auntie wouldn't
[1:42:26] want us fighting like this. Let's not
[1:42:27] have a war. But they couldn't stop it
[1:42:30] because it was prophecy. They couldn't
[1:42:32] stop it. They couldn't they couldn't
[1:42:34] start it. They couldn't stop it. God
[1:42:36] started it. God stopped it.
[1:42:40] See, and why did World War I did that
[1:42:42] first woe stop suddenly and
[1:42:43] inexplicably? They don't even understand
[1:42:45] to this day. And Willham said, "I didn't
[1:42:46] give the order to stop."
[1:42:50] The next thing you know, there's peace
[1:42:51] and the whistles are blowing. Okay, I
[1:42:53] guess we're done.
[1:42:57] But you see what no one knew is in
[1:43:00] another realm that an angel rose from
[1:43:04] the east.
[1:43:06] Oh, and he had the seal of the living
[1:43:08] God. It had had couldn't be anyone but
[1:43:11] Christ. Only the Holy Ghost can give you
[1:43:13] the seal.
[1:43:15] Hallelujah. Only the Holy Ghost can give
[1:43:17] you the seal. And he rises out of the
[1:43:20] east with a seal of the living God. And
[1:43:22] he's got authority to interdict. They've
[1:43:25] already been given a command by God. Go
[1:43:28] for it. And he says, "Wait,
[1:43:31] wait. We've already been told to go
[1:43:33] forward." Yes, but I all authority as a
[1:43:36] redeemer has been given unto me. And I
[1:43:38] say, "Hold." Why do we hold? Because I
[1:43:41] still got children. I still got I
[1:43:43] elected down there. And I got to get
[1:43:45] them sealed. Oh my. And while he's
[1:43:48] working on all of that and and and and
[1:43:50] and Europe is going in flames and World
[1:43:52] War I and the and the turn of the 20th
[1:43:55] century and the fifth trumpet and the
[1:43:56] fifth vial are breaking forth and and
[1:43:58] and all while while Europe's in broad
[1:44:01] and all of that, God is speaking to a
[1:44:04] young boy under a tree. Don't ever drink
[1:44:07] or smoke or defile your body in any way.
[1:44:10] I got a work for you to do when you get
[1:44:12] older.
[1:44:14] Oh, he starts in Armenia. He goes across
[1:44:16] to the Welsh revival, then comes and
[1:44:18] lands in Isuza Street. Why does he do
[1:44:20] that? Because Satan under under that
[1:44:23] fifth vial under that fifth trumpet. The
[1:44:25] the Satan falls from heaven as a star.
[1:44:27] He's given keys to the bottomless pit.
[1:44:29] And brother Brandham ties that right
[1:44:31] back to Isaiah and said, "How art thou
[1:44:33] fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of
[1:44:35] the morning?" And so now he's he's he's
[1:44:38] got the keys to the bottomless pit,
[1:44:40] which Brother Brandham correlates to
[1:44:42] hell. I've got quotes for that.
[1:44:44] correlates it to hell. And brother
[1:44:46] Brandon would later say, "See, the lid
[1:44:48] has been torn from hell and demon powers
[1:44:51] are streaming. Why do you think the woes
[1:44:53] could go? Why do you think that the turn
[1:44:55] of the 20th century brought all of the
[1:44:57] upheaval and things started going sinful
[1:45:00] and world wars could happen?" That's not
[1:45:02] an accident. The world's not crazy by
[1:45:04] accident. The world is crazy because it
[1:45:07] has rejected the mind of Christ.
[1:45:13] Amen. Yeah, that's the truth. And so
[1:45:16] here's this redeeming this great angel
[1:45:18] says, "Hold it." And and it's beautiful
[1:45:21] because there's where Oh, I just got to
[1:45:23] stop doing that because it just so gets
[1:45:25] me excited because brother Brandon,
[1:45:27] that's where brother Brandham said, see
[1:45:29] there's where we got to watch that
[1:45:30] little interval of time because right
[1:45:32] why that's between the sixth and seventh
[1:45:34] seal and the sixth and seventh trumpet.
[1:45:35] And while all that's going on, there's a
[1:45:37] little interval of time God's got to
[1:45:39] slip down there, send a send a gentile
[1:45:41] prophet, gather a bride around the word
[1:45:43] and perfect her and take her in a
[1:45:45] rapture, a secret catching away. Okay,
[1:45:47] fellas, you can go have at it. Go ahead.
[1:45:50] And the winds of war. Here we go. And oh
[1:45:52] my, it starts flowing and the and
[1:45:54] finally the second woe ends up in stops.
[1:45:56] Finally, it winds itself out. The woes
[1:45:59] aren't necessarily directly the war
[1:46:01] because World War II ended in 45. The
[1:46:03] second woe doesn't end till Revelation
[1:46:05] uh end well into the tribulation. In
[1:46:07] Revelation 11, the end of the second
[1:46:09] woe, behold, the third woe cometh
[1:46:10] quickly. These things aren't accidents.
[1:46:13] This is God in control of prophecy.
[1:46:16] Listen, friends, every history that's
[1:46:18] ever been has been controlled by
[1:46:20] prophecy. You are not a product of
[1:46:22] history. This is not a setting of
[1:46:24] history. This is a setting of prophecy.
[1:46:29] Hallelujah. What happened in the
[1:46:31] Coronado Forest north of Tucson? A
[1:46:33] setting of prophecy. What's happening?
[1:46:36] God is unfolding his word in a people.
[1:46:38] Oh, a people. I'm glad to be a part of
[1:46:41] that people. I never wanted to be a part
[1:46:44] of a people so bad in all my life. I
[1:46:46] want to sing I'm one of them. I'm one of
[1:46:48] them.
[1:46:52] Glory to God.
[1:46:56] Sure.
[1:46:57] So, well, and then there's another one
[1:47:00] because Malachi 4 is actually an
[1:47:04] injunction when he says he says, you
[1:47:08] know, I will send you Elijah the prophet
[1:47:12] before the coming of the great and
[1:47:15] dreadful day of the Lord. He shall turn
[1:47:17] and turn and turn. It goes on and it
[1:47:19] says, "Lest I smite." And that Hebrew
[1:47:23] word lest, it's serving as an injunction
[1:47:25] that he's saying, "Yes, it's prophesied.
[1:47:28] It's going to happen. The earth is
[1:47:29] smitten. It's going to get a curse. The
[1:47:31] woes are happening. That all of this is
[1:47:33] moving in a cluster. But but I'm going
[1:47:35] to have to put a temporary injunction
[1:47:39] because I got a gentile bride whose
[1:47:41] names are on the Lamb's Book of Life.
[1:47:43] And I've spent 2,000 years filling the
[1:47:46] record of this book, and I'm not going
[1:47:48] to lose the last age." Amen. Oh,
[1:47:52] hallelujah. Friends, when the when the
[1:47:53] enemy came in like a flood, he raised up
[1:47:56] a standard against it.
[1:48:01] And it's no one you can't you can't put
[1:48:04] an injunction. Only God can put an
[1:48:06] injunction on his own words. Nobody can
[1:48:10] stop God. Those angels were told, "Wipe
[1:48:12] it out." And one rises from the east and
[1:48:14] says, "You're going to wipe it out, but
[1:48:15] you're going to hold up till I get
[1:48:16] finished."
[1:48:18] Yes, I'm going to smite the earth with a
[1:48:19] curse, but before I do, I got to send
[1:48:21] Elijah. So, hold the phone. I got to
[1:48:23] send Elijah down and get a bride. I'm
[1:48:25] going to get her out of out of America
[1:48:27] and out of out of Africa and out of
[1:48:29] Europe and out of Asia, and I'm going to
[1:48:31] go all around the world and build a
[1:48:32] global bride and take her home.
[1:48:37] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:48:40] Lord. all of these redeemers, all of
[1:48:43] these God operating in this way. That's
[1:48:46] why this message is mercy and people
[1:48:49] hate it and they don't know it's a
[1:48:51] temporary injunction against the end of
[1:48:53] the world.
[1:48:55] And once the bride is taken home, then
[1:48:57] then the the blood the the blood who the
[1:49:00] bride is the blood by the spirit, right?
[1:49:03] Goes
[1:49:04] home. And then there's no more blood
[1:49:07] covering for the Gentiles and mercy's
[1:49:09] over. Now the the the the the that eagle
[1:49:14] anointing doesn't go back home. He lifts
[1:49:17] up, flies east, picks up Moses and
[1:49:20] Elijah, and heads to the 144,000 because
[1:49:23] they're also going to believe this
[1:49:24] message. They're also going to be born
[1:49:26] of the Holy Spirit. They're also going
[1:49:28] to get a token. They're also going to be
[1:49:29] part of the first resurrection. They're
[1:49:31] going to be resurrected. They're part of
[1:49:33] that resurrection. And they're going to
[1:49:35] be with us in the millennium.
[1:49:38] Oh my.
[1:49:43] You good?
[1:49:46] Numbers 14.
[1:49:51] Praise God.
[1:49:53] Numbers 14.
[1:49:58] Verses
[1:49:59] 11 and we'll go down
[1:50:01] through I'm going to eventually get to
[1:50:04] 24, but we'll probably stop at about 19
[1:50:06] verses. Numbers
[1:50:09] 14:11. Now we're back to
[1:50:12] Moses. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[1:50:14] "How long will this people provoke me?
[1:50:17] How long will it be? Heir they believe
[1:50:19] me for all the signs which I have showed
[1:50:21] among them. I will smite them with the
[1:50:24] pestilence and disinherit them and will
[1:50:26] make of thee. Moses will make of you a
[1:50:30] greater nation and mightier than they.
[1:50:33] And Moses said unto the Lord, well then
[1:50:37] the Egyptians will hear it, for thou
[1:50:40] bringest up this people and thy might
[1:50:42] from among them. They're going to know
[1:50:44] what happened. Amen. and they will tell
[1:50:47] it to the inhabitants of this land. For
[1:50:49] they have heard that the that that thou,
[1:50:52] Lord, art among this people, that thou,
[1:50:54] Lord, art seen face to face, and that
[1:50:57] that and that thy cloud standeth over
[1:51:00] them, and that thou goest before them by
[1:51:02] day, and a pillar of a cloud, and in a
[1:51:05] pillar of fire by night. Now if you kill
[1:51:08] all this people as one man, then the
[1:51:12] nations which have heard the fame of
[1:51:14] thee will speak, saying, because the
[1:51:16] Lord was not able to bring this people
[1:51:19] into the land which he swore unto them,
[1:51:20] therefore he hath slain them in the
[1:51:22] wilderness. How convenient.
[1:51:27] And now I beseech thee, let the power of
[1:51:30] my Lord be great according as thou has
[1:51:33] spoken, saying, "The Lord is
[1:51:36] longsuffering." Can you emphasize, can
[1:51:38] you pay attention to that one, Lord? I
[1:51:40] know all those judgment ones and death
[1:51:42] and killing and plagues and famine, but
[1:51:44] can you can we talk about how that
[1:51:46] you're a redeemer? Can we talk about how
[1:51:48] your throne is established in mercy? Can
[1:51:51] we talk about how that mercy rejoicth
[1:51:53] against judgment?
[1:51:56] Think about this, Lord. I want you to
[1:51:58] think about your word. The Lord is
[1:52:01] long-suffering. It's like Moses is
[1:52:03] saying, "Let this mind which was in you
[1:52:05] be in you."
[1:52:08] God, "Whatsoever things, Lord, are
[1:52:10] lovely and of a good report, think on
[1:52:11] these things, please."
[1:52:15] Amen. Here's what I want you to think
[1:52:17] on. Let the power of my Lord be great
[1:52:20] according as thou has spoken, saying,
[1:52:22] The Lord is long-suffering and of great
[1:52:24] mercy, forgiving iniquity and
[1:52:26] transgression, and by no means clearing
[1:52:27] the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the
[1:52:30] father. You're not a compromiser. You're
[1:52:31] not a dirty grandpa, but your throne is
[1:52:34] still established in mercy, and and and
[1:52:36] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[1:52:38] children of the third and fourth
[1:52:39] generation. Pardon, I beseech thee the
[1:52:42] iniquity of this people according unto
[1:52:45] the gener the greatness of thy mercy as
[1:52:48] thou hast forgiven this people from
[1:52:50] Egypt even to now. Lord, it's been 2,000
[1:52:54] years. Don't give up on us now.
[1:52:58] Oh, you've waited so long to claim a
[1:53:00] bride. Come on, Lord. Come get this
[1:53:03] bride. We're just as ready as you are to
[1:53:05] sit at a table a thousand miles long.
[1:53:08] Amen. Amen. So strong then see and I
[1:53:13] I'll come back to that in a minute. So
[1:53:15] strong is this principle of God in
[1:53:19] expression as we've been talking about
[1:53:21] and brother Chad built so beautifully on
[1:53:24] that today and just extrapolated that
[1:53:26] out so gloriously. So God th this
[1:53:30] principle of God in expression is so
[1:53:33] great that that Moses with with no way
[1:53:37] to physically stop God. He can't stop
[1:53:40] God physically and save Israel because
[1:53:44] that's just something of the flesh. No
[1:53:46] mortal man can withstand the God of
[1:53:50] heaven and resist him. But in a realm
[1:53:53] that no one could see. Oh hallelujah.
[1:53:56] there was a some kind of connection that
[1:53:59] was at another level and the spirit of
[1:54:02] God had called for a redeemer. He
[1:54:05] wondered is there nobody is there no I
[1:54:08] wonder that there's nobody to take the
[1:54:10] to take the charge and be a redeemer and
[1:54:12] step out
[1:54:14] and so the Bible said as we read so God
[1:54:17] took it upon himself to become a
[1:54:19] redeemer. Is there no one who can stand
[1:54:22] in the gap between the sinful people and
[1:54:24] a righteous God? Is there no one who can
[1:54:27] be like that who can save these people?
[1:54:30] Is not there a man, Lord? Is not there a
[1:54:32] man in the middle somewhere? Oh,
[1:54:35] friends, do you realize what was
[1:54:37] happening when a prophet was standing
[1:54:38] there and he's here comes the greatest
[1:54:41] event the world's been waiting on the
[1:54:43] book the mystery of redemption sealed up
[1:54:46] the church. You know, here here's
[1:54:48] Christ. He cannot He's He's going to
[1:54:51] take a bride. And we realize the seed
[1:54:53] had to go into the ground. I get that.
[1:54:54] I'm not preaching about that. That's
[1:54:56] that's all going to o over have
[1:54:58] oversight over the whole thing. Again,
[1:54:59] it's history controlled by prophecy. But
[1:55:02] you realize then that what happened in
[1:55:04] real time was that that early alpha
[1:55:06] church backslid.
[1:55:09] And so instead of Christ being able to
[1:55:12] come and claim a bride, he had to what?
[1:55:15] Sit back down in the eternities, seal up
[1:55:18] the word under seven seals, start
[1:55:20] interceding on behalf of the ignorance
[1:55:22] of the people. And this is why even
[1:55:24] Luther and why Wesley could teach
[1:55:27] doctrines of devils, which was three
[1:55:29] unclean spirits like frogs, and teach a
[1:55:32] trinity doctrine, and yet it'd be okay.
[1:55:34] And God was still saving his people out
[1:55:36] of the world. Exactly.
[1:55:39] But it was never going to stay that way
[1:55:41] because the omega had to return to the
[1:55:43] alpha.
[1:55:45] See, this is this is this is why this is
[1:55:47] why what we have is a restoration. It's
[1:55:50] not another gospel. It's a restoration
[1:55:52] of the original gospel because they went
[1:55:55] so high and then they apexed and begin
[1:55:57] to decline. This omega message takes us
[1:56:00] back to that apex and takes us on into a
[1:56:03] body change. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:56:06] That's why he said, "I never preached
[1:56:08] anything but what Paul preached because
[1:56:10] everything that we understand in the
[1:56:12] message, I understand that that things
[1:56:14] had to come in fulfillment and we're
[1:56:16] going to experience things that Alpha
[1:56:18] Church didn't." If you struggle with
[1:56:20] that, then just go ahead and cut to the
[1:56:22] chase and just realize you're going to
[1:56:24] be alive and remain and be changed. That
[1:56:27] never happened to them. They didn't live
[1:56:29] long enough. The church declined, but
[1:56:31] you have been restored.
[1:56:33] Hallelujah. So, we're not talking about
[1:56:35] the need for an eighth age or an eighth
[1:56:37] messenger or an eighth this or an eighth
[1:56:38] that. The the word has certainly
[1:56:40] returned to its eternal day. My soul is
[1:56:42] still its an eternal day. Even in the
[1:56:45] millennium, the earth will still be
[1:56:46] waiting for its eighth day. But the word
[1:56:49] clearly has went back. The the omega has
[1:56:52] now joined back to the alpha.
[1:56:55] Sure. Every doctrine we have, you know,
[1:56:58] I I had a minister trying to convince me
[1:57:00] that what we have is more than what Paul
[1:57:03] had. I said, "Well, our experience might
[1:57:06] be greater than the first church. We're
[1:57:07] going in a body change." They didn't. So
[1:57:09] I Okay, fine. But don't Okay. If if we
[1:57:13] have more understanding of the of Christ
[1:57:16] and the mystery of God, please tell me
[1:57:19] which of our doctrines is not based on
[1:57:21] what Paul taught,
[1:57:25] the Godhead, water baptism, the original
[1:57:29] sin, the identity of Melzdc, the mystery
[1:57:33] of the rapture.
[1:57:35] Which one? What what doctrine? marriage
[1:57:38] and divorce, the the gifts of the
[1:57:40] spirit. Tell me tell me the coming of
[1:57:42] the Lord in three phases. Shout, voice,
[1:57:44] trumpet. Tell me what doctrine that we
[1:57:46] have that Paul is that is not based on
[1:57:49] what Paul taught. Well, we're the final
[1:57:51] voice to the final age. Of course, we
[1:57:53] are because Paul was the final voice to
[1:57:55] all the ages. And he said, "My words
[1:57:58] can't be countermanded. Even I can't
[1:57:59] change them. No angel can change them.
[1:58:02] Even God couldn't change them because
[1:58:03] God gave them to him. that God never
[1:58:05] changes his mind about his word.
[1:58:08] You can rely on that. He'll never change
[1:58:11] his mind about his word.
[1:58:14] Thank you, Jesus. See? Yeah. So, so, so
[1:58:18] we find that this is why Brother
[1:58:19] Brandham talked about that age. They had
[1:58:21] the It was the Jubilee, the long awaited
[1:58:23] Jubilee. Brother Ram said they had the
[1:58:24] abstract title deed. The token was on
[1:58:27] full display. They were ready for a
[1:58:29] rapture until they backslid.
[1:58:31] See, I I'm not preaching on that
[1:58:33] tonight. Let me get off that. Amen. I
[1:58:35] see you starting to blink. I don't know
[1:58:36] if you're getting sleepy or I've lost
[1:58:38] you
[1:58:40] somewhere. You good?
[1:58:42] Do we need to stand up sing and let me
[1:58:44] keep going?
[1:58:47] So, so now you've got a prophet in our
[1:58:51] day and he comes to these opening of
[1:58:53] these seals and it's going to be a
[1:58:56] complete restoration. And this is why
[1:58:57] brother Brandham, this is exactly why
[1:58:59] brother Brandham when he's teaching in
[1:59:02] the book of revelation and he says you
[1:59:04] notice that he's all the time saying I'm
[1:59:08] the first and I'm the last. I'm the
[1:59:11] beginning and I'm the ending. I'm the
[1:59:14] alpha. I'm the omega. And brother
[1:59:17] Brandham points out he doesn't say a lot
[1:59:19] about the middle.
[1:59:21] He said it's like you're standing.
[1:59:22] Brother Brandham used the the the
[1:59:24] imagery of standing in front of the
[1:59:26] seven lampstands and and he said Jesus
[1:59:28] is standing in front of him and he's got
[1:59:30] his hand stretched out and he's saying
[1:59:32] I'm the alpha and I'm the omega. And and
[1:59:35] brother Brandham is explaining. You say,
[1:59:37] "Well, wasn't Christ in the middle?" Of
[1:59:40] course he was. John saw him walking in
[1:59:42] the middle of the seven lampstands.
[1:59:43] Jesus said, "I'll never leave you nor
[1:59:45] forsake you." So certainly Jesus was in
[1:59:47] the middle, but not everything in the
[1:59:50] middle was Jesus. It had become another
[1:59:53] Jesus that Paul feared. It had become
[1:59:56] what brother Brandham called an ad
[1:59:58] mixture. But the alpha and the omega
[2:00:02] were perfect. The alpha was the word and
[2:00:05] the word alone, unadulterated, unmixed.
[2:00:08] The the the omega is a restoration of
[2:00:12] that alpha. Hallelujah. Friends, no
[2:00:14] wonder we can go home in a body change.
[2:00:19] Yes, sir. So this is this is what the
[2:00:21] prophet taught. This is this is basic
[2:00:23] stuff. Brother Brandham taught this over
[2:00:24] and over and over. And so so we find
[2:00:28] that that here stands brother Brandham.
[2:00:30] And now watch he's standing there and
[2:00:32] he's he's he's coming to the point where
[2:00:35] here John representing the bride. Here's
[2:00:37] a strong angel representing uh uh the
[2:00:41] the prophet of our day, brother
[2:00:42] Brandham. And you say, "How do you know
[2:00:44] he's a prophet?" Because John kept
[2:00:45] trying to worship him several times and
[2:00:47] he kept stopping him. Because any true
[2:00:49] prophet will always redirect worship
[2:00:51] back to the worthy one away from
[2:00:53] himself. It's a sign of a true prophet.
[2:00:55] And he says, "Don't worship me. I'm just
[2:00:57] one of your brothers, one of the
[2:00:58] prophets." He was John's tour guide. And
[2:01:00] so he's standing there and this strong
[2:01:03] angel cries out, "Who is worthy? Let him
[2:01:07] come and take the book." And brother
[2:01:09] Brandham says, "Oh, maybe I'm just
[2:01:11] feeling it this way, but let him come
[2:01:14] and take the book if he will and loose
[2:01:17] the seals or forever hold his peace."
[2:01:21] What What kind of anointing was on that?
[2:01:23] If you go back to Deuteronomy 31, you
[2:01:26] find that God said to Moses, "Moses, the
[2:01:29] time that has come that you must die.
[2:01:34] call for Joshua and present yourselves
[2:01:37] in the tabernacle of the congregation.
[2:01:39] And he calls for Joshua cuz Joshua is
[2:01:42] going to lead him over. Not Moses. Moses
[2:01:44] is going to leave the scene. But Moses
[2:01:47] call for Joshua. Prophet, not Aaron, not
[2:01:50] priest, not a preacher. Prophet Moses
[2:01:52] call for Joshua. If you don't call him,
[2:01:54] he won't come. Call him. And he come.
[2:01:57] And then Moses and Joshua present
[2:01:59] themselves together. And the pillar of
[2:02:01] fire comes on the scene.
[2:02:05] And here is a prophet saying, "Oh, let
[2:02:06] him come." He's calling the Holy Ghost,
[2:02:09] calling on the Joshua ministry. Come and
[2:02:12] take the book. And and John is weeping.
[2:02:15] He's crying. And here comes a a
[2:02:18] theophony saying to him, "Don't weep."
[2:02:20] John, one of the 24 elders. And John
[2:02:22] himself actually was one of those 24
[2:02:24] elders. And he says, "Don't weep, John.
[2:02:26] Stop crying. Calm down, son. Uh stand
[2:02:28] up. It's okay. the lion of the tribe of
[2:02:30] Judah, he has prevailed. And John turned
[2:02:32] to see a lion and he saw a lamb.
[2:02:36] See, he saw a lamb and the lamb comes
[2:02:38] forward and takes the book and and and
[2:02:40] this strong angel is has to call for
[2:02:43] this worthy one as Moses calls for
[2:02:46] Joshua. And I don't want to I can't keep
[2:02:48] taking side channels even though I keep
[2:02:49] feeling pulled in that direction. But we
[2:02:51] realize that now Moses had entered into
[2:02:54] a channel. Now we're back to our
[2:02:56] scripture. Moses has entered into a
[2:02:59] channel as an intercessor. The anointing
[2:03:01] of a redeemer is taking over his lips
[2:03:04] and he's saying, "Pardon them. Oh,
[2:03:07] pardon them and forgive them and let
[2:03:09] your mercy be great. Yes, they did all
[2:03:12] these things. Yes, it's true. You can
[2:03:14] indict them. You can destroy them. It
[2:03:16] would be just. It would be sensible. It
[2:03:18] would be logical. But the Holy Spirit
[2:03:20] isn't concerned about man's logic or
[2:03:22] man's reasoning. He's dealing with
[2:03:25] election. And this is his family.
[2:03:31] If he is dealing with election, friends,
[2:03:33] you and I would have been gone a long
[2:03:34] time ago. We'd have been kicked to the
[2:03:36] curb. Oh, I'm so glad he's not working
[2:03:39] by man's theory. I'm so glad it's a word
[2:03:42] of the living God that has called me.
[2:03:48] He stood in the gap at the risk of his
[2:03:50] own life. Something compelled him.
[2:03:53] compelled him from another realm and he
[2:03:55] he couldn't keep
[2:03:57] silent and and and so you know it was
[2:04:00] fair. God had every right to do it but
[2:04:04] election goes to a whole another level.
[2:04:05] Grace finds a way.
[2:04:09] It's not favoritism.
[2:04:12] It's origin.
[2:04:15] It's origin. Yeah, that's right. It's
[2:04:18] not It's not unfair to you that I was
[2:04:22] born the son of Ed Watkins. That's not
[2:04:25] has nothing to do with fairness. You
[2:04:26] weren't. I was. You weren't. Okay, but
[2:04:29] that's not anything to do with fairness.
[2:04:31] It just is. He was my dad. I I'm not the
[2:04:34] son of your dad. And that has nothing to
[2:04:37] do with fairness. You might You don't
[2:04:39] have liked my dad. You You might have
[2:04:40] say, you know, me and my dad have
[2:04:42] problems. I think I'd like to had your
[2:04:44] dad. I'm sorry you couldn't get my dad.
[2:04:46] I He was my dad. I came out of his
[2:04:48] loins. It's not about fairness. See,
[2:04:52] God. And so, so, so we realize that it's
[2:04:55] not favoritism. It's origin. And, and
[2:04:58] the redeemer is redeeming his family
[2:04:59] because God God loves his offspring.
[2:05:02] It's the heritage of the Lord. He had
[2:05:04] already spoken. He had already spoken uh
[2:05:07] through Moses to Pharaoh.
[2:05:12] He had already told him, "This is what
[2:05:13] we're going to do." And you know, you
[2:05:16] know how that goes. Pharaoh's like,
[2:05:17] "Well, okay. I tell you what, you can go
[2:05:20] for a while, but leave your little ones
[2:05:21] and leave your cattle and all your
[2:05:23] livestock and go out and worship and
[2:05:25] then come on back." And Moses said,
[2:05:27] "You're missing the point, buddy.
[2:05:31] We're leaving. We ain't coming back."
[2:05:33] Amen. God is delivering us. You're not
[2:05:36] letting us go. You already God's even
[2:05:39] going to harden your heart so you
[2:05:40] wouldn't let us go so he can take us.
[2:05:43] You're not going to say that you helped
[2:05:45] Abraham's family. Abraham wouldn't take
[2:05:47] an offering from those kings. He said,
[2:05:49] "Then you'll say you've made Abraham
[2:05:51] rich and I'm not going to be indebted to
[2:05:53] this world. I'm not going to be indebted
[2:05:55] to the devil. I'm not looking for a
[2:05:57] treaty or an armistice or a truce. I'll
[2:05:59] leave you alone if you leave me alone."
[2:06:01] Nothing doing. I'm going after him. I'm
[2:06:04] going after God's family. I'm going
[2:06:06] after every prisoner of war. That's what
[2:06:08] preachers do.
[2:06:13] We'll leave nothing of the Lord's
[2:06:14] heritage behind.
[2:06:17] It's your right under redemption. I'm
[2:06:21] moving to the finish line. It's your
[2:06:24] right. Redemption has authority in it.
[2:06:27] And if you can just believe it and
[2:06:29] accept it, then it'll go to working for
[2:06:31] you. It's a force. It's an energy. It's
[2:06:33] God's life. It moves. It'll it God has
[2:06:37] used his redemptive power. What's he
[2:06:40] been doing? Redeeming his family and
[2:06:41] that has shaped and molded history, not
[2:06:43] the other way around. It wasn't God
[2:06:46] going, "Oh my goodness, this is
[2:06:47] happening. I better come up with a plan.
[2:06:49] Oh my goodness, I thought this wasn't
[2:06:50] going to happen. It's happening. I
[2:06:51] better come up with a plan of
[2:06:52] redemption." All of these things are
[2:06:54] happening because of the plan of
[2:06:56] redemption.
[2:06:57] It's it's all part of God's redemptive
[2:07:00] plan. We're not going to surrender.
[2:07:02] Moses said, "We're not leaving anything
[2:07:04] behind." I'm here to tell you something,
[2:07:06] friends. I'm not going to I'm not going
[2:07:08] to surrender the mind of Christ to the
[2:07:10] insanity of this world. I don't have to,
[2:07:14] and I'm not going to. We're not going to
[2:07:16] surrender our peace that passes all
[2:07:19] understanding. We're not going to
[2:07:21] surrender faith that moves mountains.
[2:07:23] We're not going to surrender our
[2:07:25] marriages. We're not going to surrender
[2:07:27] our teenagers. We're not going to
[2:07:28] surrender our families. We're not going
[2:07:30] to surrender our churches. Not one of
[2:07:33] them.
[2:07:34] [Applause]
[2:07:38] Amen. God will take our children home
[2:07:40] before he'll give them to the Satan if
[2:07:43] he has to. They're our inheritance.
[2:07:46] There's never been an age There's never
[2:07:49] been an age like this age where the
[2:07:52] spirit of depression and anxiety are
[2:07:55] raging and ripe. And brother Brandham
[2:07:58] directly, I don't have the time to get
[2:07:59] to the quotes tonight, but brother
[2:08:01] Brandham, I never knew it till the other
[2:08:02] day, he tied that directly to the
[2:08:05] accelerated men shall run to and fro at
[2:08:08] the end time and knowledge shall be
[2:08:09] increased. And he says the mind of man
[2:08:11] can't keep up with that. It's just
[2:08:13] happening too quick and he's going crazy
[2:08:15] over it. And it's what's caused a
[2:08:17] neurotic age. But I'm here to tell you,
[2:08:19] I'm not going to give up the mind of
[2:08:20] Christ. I'm not going to give into
[2:08:22] depression or an anxiety. We will not
[2:08:26] surrender our rights to have the joy of
[2:08:29] the Lord. It is joy unspeakable and full
[2:08:33] of glory and it's mine and it's yours.
[2:08:37] [Applause]
[2:08:43] And the Lord said, I have pardoned
[2:08:45] according to thy word. Verse 20.
[2:08:47] But as truly as I live, all the earth
[2:08:49] shall be filled with the glory of the
[2:08:51] Lord. Because all those men which have
[2:08:53] seen my glory and my
[2:08:54] miracles, which I did in Egypt and in
[2:08:57] the wilderness, and have tempted me now
[2:08:58] these 10 times, and have not hearkened
[2:09:00] to my voice, surely they shall not see
[2:09:03] the land which I swore unto their
[2:09:05] fathers. Neither shall any of them that
[2:09:08] provoke me see it. I love this. But my
[2:09:11] servant Caleb, because he had another
[2:09:14] spirit with him, and hath followed me
[2:09:17] fully, him will I bring into the land
[2:09:20] wherein to he went, and his seed shall
[2:09:24] possess it.
[2:09:27] Yes, sir. You see
[2:09:29] friends, as we come down to the end
[2:09:33] time, something that jumps out at me as
[2:09:37] we are living in these closing scenes of
[2:09:41] earth's history is the massive contrast
[2:09:46] between the false church of Revelation 3
[2:09:51] and the bride in Revelation 22. Yeah.
[2:09:55] The spirit and the bride say come.
[2:10:00] See, now that's important
[2:10:02] because that that you find that typed
[2:10:06] back in Nehemiah chapter 2 where where
[2:10:10] Nehemiah is ready to go back and it's
[2:10:12] it's approaching the time of the feast
[2:10:14] of tabernacles which is millennium.
[2:10:16] Speaks of millennium. It's a little
[2:10:18] broader than that, but it speaks uh
[2:10:20] feast of tabernacles, feast of booths,
[2:10:22] and it's it's the millennium and it's
[2:10:25] Nehemiah is coming back. Ezra had
[2:10:27] Zerubabel had already went not by might,
[2:10:30] not by power, by my spirit. Remember,
[2:10:32] say that to Zerubable. Then then 13
[2:10:34] years later, Ezra takes back some more.
[2:10:36] And then finally, Nehemiah is going to
[2:10:38] go back and they're going to try to get
[2:10:39] the uh you know, the foundation and get
[2:10:41] the temple and get the wall and trying
[2:10:42] to get it all back restored. Cyrus had
[2:10:44] told them they could redo it. And now
[2:10:47] it's come down through a long time and
[2:10:49] lots of trials. And Nehemiah comes to
[2:10:51] the king. It's time for the feast of
[2:10:53] tabernacles. Can I go back? And he says,
[2:10:55] you know, how long will you be gone? And
[2:10:57] what will you do? And this is what I'll
[2:10:58] do and then I'll come back and all this
[2:10:59] kind of stuff. And the Bible says that
[2:11:01] the shows us in Nehemiah 2 that the king
[2:11:03] granted it. And the Bible says a curious
[2:11:05] thing only in one place in the whole all
[2:11:07] the Bible. And the queen sitting with
[2:11:10] him and the queen with him. She wasn't
[2:11:13] talking because the whole context of the
[2:11:16] Hebrew is she's speaking in one unified
[2:11:18] voice. She's agreeing what the king has
[2:11:19] said. She's saying amen.
[2:11:22] And it's the only time at the time of
[2:11:23] the feast of tabernacles at the
[2:11:25] restoration of Israel.
[2:11:27] That now you've got what do you got?
[2:11:29] Because that's Esther. That if you go
[2:11:31] back to to even theologians agree with
[2:11:34] that. If you do the math, it's real easy
[2:11:35] to figure out. That is almost certainly
[2:11:38] Esther. And and here you go, friends. Oh
[2:11:40] my goodness. You've got a you've got a
[2:11:43] king and you've got a queen and you've
[2:11:45] got the time of the feast of tabernacles
[2:11:46] and you've got the restoration of Israel
[2:11:49] and you've got a queen speaking in the
[2:11:51] unified voice. The spirit and the bride
[2:11:54] say come.
[2:11:56] Oh, it's going home time, friends. We're
[2:11:58] ready to go home.
[2:12:02] And what? Look at the contrast. You've
[2:12:04] got a church in chapter 3 that basically
[2:12:08] they're they're they're they're defying
[2:12:10] God. I have. We have. We don't need. We
[2:12:12] got this. You know, I I'm enriched and
[2:12:14] increased with goods. I don't need the
[2:12:16] word. I don't need We certainly don't
[2:12:18] need We've spent all this time building
[2:12:20] up our program in church. I don't need
[2:12:22] the word of God interfering with that.
[2:12:24] And they're going to literally put him
[2:12:25] out.
[2:12:28] And they're going to cease being the
[2:12:30] mouthpiece of God because God's going to
[2:12:32] take that privilege from See, because
[2:12:35] when you want to believe a lie, he'll go
[2:12:36] ahead and let you and then you'll be
[2:12:38] damned by it. See, and you can't hang
[2:12:40] that on God. You can't pin that on God.
[2:12:42] Jesus picks that up. Going back to quote
[2:12:44] the the Old Testament prophet, he says,
[2:12:47] "And their eyes they have closed, lest
[2:12:51] they should see the glorious word." And
[2:12:53] then I and then I and then they believe
[2:12:55] and then I heal them. They have closed
[2:12:57] their eyes. When you close your eyes for
[2:12:59] the last time, then God says, "Okay,
[2:13:01] then you will never see it again." And I
[2:13:03] say unto you that all those men who were
[2:13:06] bidden to come to my supper and one
[2:13:08] said, "I've married a wife and I have me
[2:13:10] excused." And and the Lord just said,
[2:13:11] "Granted. You're excused. I bought a
[2:13:13] piece of land. Have me excused. Granted.
[2:13:15] I bought a yoke of oxen. I can't come."
[2:13:18] Granted. Granted. Granted. Granted,
[2:13:20] Lord, what do we do? There's still room.
[2:13:21] Go into the hedges and to the highways.
[2:13:24] And that's where he found me. And that's
[2:13:26] where he found you. And we didn't give
[2:13:27] him an excuse. We said, "I'll gladly
[2:13:30] come to the feast.
[2:13:33] My table will be full.
[2:13:37] What a contrast. One church who's no
[2:13:39] longer his mouthpiece. And he's going to
[2:13:42] turn on her because the voice of God
[2:13:44] will be in the bride.
[2:13:46] Hallelujah, friends. That's your
[2:13:48] inheritance. That's what comes with
[2:13:50] election. That's what comes in
[2:13:52] redemption. It's the power. It makes you
[2:13:54] a redeemer.
[2:14:02] Praise God. See their blindness. They
[2:14:04] couldn't
[2:14:05] perceive that they had reached the last
[2:14:08] gasp of a dying
[2:14:10] world and the time of the end had
[2:14:13] arrived. But the bride in Revelation 22,
[2:14:19] she had a whole different outlook. She
[2:14:22] said, you know, the spirit and the bride
[2:14:24] say come. You know why she could have
[2:14:27] that kind of message? cuz she heard the
[2:14:29] message of grace and just before it's
[2:14:32] over, right at the last of the book. And
[2:14:35] it's almost over and we're just about
[2:14:37] done. And the spirit and the bride one
[2:14:39] last time, whosoever will quickly, it's
[2:14:42] almost over. If you're here tonight,
[2:14:44] it's almost over. And the message of
[2:14:47] grace is coming to you. It's a bride who
[2:14:49] heard a tape called God Rich in Mercy.
[2:14:53] Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad that I am
[2:14:56] part of that group. I'm so glad to be in
[2:14:58] that number. Oh my. The Lord Jesus sent
[2:15:01] his angel. Think about it. His
[2:15:03] signifying angel. His signifying angel.
[2:15:06] The spirit of Christ and the bride are
[2:15:08] all speaking in a unified voice. Oh,
[2:15:12] this is the day that the Lord has made.
[2:15:16] I will rejoice and be glad in it. This
[2:15:21] is the day. This is the day that the
[2:15:25] Lord has made.
[2:15:29] Oh, stand to your feet. Let's rejoice in
[2:15:31] him tonight. Let me have my musicians.
[2:15:34] Amen. Y'all sing that here, brother. If
[2:15:35] not, all right, that's an oldie goie.
[2:15:37] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[2:15:41] I will be glad and rejoice in it. Oh,
[2:15:44] hallelujah, friends. Hallelujah.
[2:15:48] Hallelujah.
[2:15:51] Thank you, Lord.
[2:15:53] Oh, so much more we could have got to.
[2:15:56] We're completely out of time. You know
[2:16:00] something? Just as we they ceue that up
[2:16:03] and get that
[2:16:04] ready. I'm I'm
[2:16:07] I'm not of that
[2:16:09] group who plunge off the edge and go
[2:16:13] screaming into the abyss. Amen.
[2:16:17] That's not my inheritance.
[2:16:21] I have no desire to be that. I don't
[2:16:24] want to follow that witch. I don't want
[2:16:25] that kind of church. I don't want that
[2:16:27] kind of religion. I want the the kind
[2:16:30] that God poured out on the day of
[2:16:32] Pentecost. The real fire breathing Holy
[2:16:34] Ghost. We've been completely restored
[2:16:36] back to an abstract deed. That means
[2:16:39] everything that's ever was is struck off
[2:16:41] against you. Oh, you can you can rejoice
[2:16:44] in it, friend, because this is the day
[2:16:46] the Lord has made and he's chosen you to
[2:16:48] be in it. You see, now now you know what
[2:16:51] we've done. We've come full circle back
[2:16:54] to Abraham.
[2:16:55] God was had already assured him. God had
[2:16:58] already told him who he is, what's going
[2:17:00] to happen. A prophet came in this day.
[2:17:03] He's told you who Christ was. He's told
[2:17:04] you who you are. He's showed you the
[2:17:06] word of God. He's invited you to the
[2:17:08] table. You're sitting there feasting
[2:17:10] with the king.
[2:17:14] All God needed Abraham to do, what
[2:17:16] Abraham, listen, it all comes down to
[2:17:19] this. Keep going forward.
[2:17:22] [Music]
[2:17:26] As preachers, we don't have all the
[2:17:29] answers. Does that shock you? We wonder
[2:17:32] at things. We I don't know how all this
[2:17:35] is going to play out, but but I do know
[2:17:38] my destination.
[2:17:40] I do know I'm headed to Mount Zion. I do
[2:17:43] know it only goes up and I'm climbing. I
[2:17:46] do know that I'm reaching for a higher
[2:17:48] handhold. How about you do that tonight?
[2:17:50] Say, "Lord, I'm going to reach for a
[2:17:52] higher handhold. Eventually, I'm going
[2:17:54] to get to the top because this is the
[2:17:56] day the Lord has made. I've been called
[2:18:00] to the marriage supper of the lamb."
[2:18:03] What a privileged people. Just keep
[2:18:04] going forward. We don't have to figure
[2:18:07] it all out. I don't know exactly how it
[2:18:09] all play out, but I know I'm one of
[2:18:11] them. I know where I'm going. I know
[2:18:13] this word is true. Just keep going
[2:18:16] forward because forward is onward and
[2:18:19] onward is
[2:18:23] [Applause]
[2:18:25] upward.
[2:18:30] Hallelujah. And I want to go
[2:18:35] upward. Help me out. is a

[2:20:14] redemption took place? You know what
[2:20:16] happened at the end of chapter 59 of
[2:20:18] Isaiah? Isaiah 60. Arise, shine, thy
[2:20:24] light has come. Oh, once redemption was
[2:20:28] in place. Once the great emancipator had
[2:20:31] forgiven us and had placed us and had
[2:20:34] brought us to his banqueting table. Now
[2:20:36] the message to you. Yes, it's a dark
[2:20:38] world. Yes, gross darkness is upon the
[2:20:40] people. But arise, shine. Thy light has
[2:20:44] come. Oh, have you come to the rising of
[2:20:47] the sun under full
[2:20:51] redemption. Hallelujah. Give the Lord a
[2:20:53] hand. Oh, glory to God. Glory to God.

[2:32:35] and all the
[2:32:41] praise. Amen. Let's give him a praise
[2:32:44] offering.
[2:32:48] [Music]
[2:32:50] Lord, you're so good to us. You're so
[2:32:53] good to us, Lord. And we can never thank
[2:32:55] you
[2:32:56] enough. Let's pray tonight. Can you bow
[2:32:59] your heads
[2:33:05] tonight? Heavenly Father, thank you for
[2:33:08] allowing us to come to your table
[2:33:11] tonight. You at the head of the table,
[2:33:14] Lord.
[2:33:16] You served the word tonight. Fresh
[2:33:20] strong meat, Lord, that we can put it
[2:33:23] into our
[2:33:24] bodies. Strength and nourishment for our
[2:33:27] souls. Oh, we thank you tonight, Lord.
[2:33:29] Thank you for the liberty. Thank you for
[2:33:32] the Holy Spirit moving in and
[2:33:34] out of the aisles, walking the aisles
[2:33:37] tonight, walking the hearts and touching
[2:33:39] hearts tonight. Lord, I ask you to bless
[2:33:43] brother Jason Watkins, Lord, restoring
[2:33:45] him virtue, Lord, as he dropped into
[2:33:47] that extra gear, Lord. And it was not
[2:33:50] him, it was you using his voice. We
[2:33:53] thank you for that tonight, Lord. We
[2:33:55] love you. Thank you for your goodness
[2:33:57] and your grace in our lives. We love you
[2:34:00] and we praise you. We ask you to bless
[2:34:02] our visitors here tonight. Bless the
[2:34:05] needy tonight. We love you and we praise
[2:34:08] you. Everyone said amen. It's been good
[2:34:12] to be in the house of the Lord. Remember
[2:34:13] our service tomorrow morning at 10
[2:34:15] o'clock. Thank you again for all the
[2:34:17] helpers and the visitors that helped
[2:34:19] today with their lunch. We want to say
[2:34:20] God bless you. May the Lord be your
[2:34:22] portion tonight as we go. Even so, come
[2:34:24] Lord Jesus come. This will be our
[2:34:26] dismissal song tonight. Amen. Looking
[2:34:29] forward to the final service tomorrow
[2:34:30] morning. Even
[2:34:34] so come Lord
[2:34:37] Jesus
[2:34:38] come. Would this be your prayer
[2:34:47] tonight? Take your
[2:34:49] ride away.

[2:35:17] my
[2:35:22] leave for Jesus.
[2:35:26] This next verse, I hope it's your
[2:35:28] declaration to him tonight. Oh Lord, you
[2:35:33] are the love of my soul.
[2:35:44] And Lord, you
[2:35:46] are
[2:35:48] exalted
[2:35:50] over

[2:36:31] Thank you for coming and being with us.
[2:36:34] The local churches here in peace. You
[2:36:36] come. You blessed us with your presence.

[2:36:41] came from Flagstaff or Tucson, God bless
[2:36:43] you. You come from out of state, God
