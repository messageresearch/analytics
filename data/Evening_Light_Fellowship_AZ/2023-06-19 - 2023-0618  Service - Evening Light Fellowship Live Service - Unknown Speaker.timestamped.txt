[52:26] be gathered in the house of the Lord
[52:28] and uh like to say to all the fathers
[52:31] Happy Father's Day and I was I was
[52:35] thinking about Father's Day and I I
[52:39] thought you know it is not a burden to
[52:41] be a father
[52:42] it's not a burden to be a father but
[52:45] it's it's a blessing to be a father and
[52:48] it is an honor to be a father and so may
[52:51] we just uh it's easy to say that when
[52:53] everything's going okay isn't it
[52:57] but it's still a blessing and it's still
[52:59] an honor and I honor you all of our
[53:02] faithful Godly fathers who have raised
[53:06] children who have raised families who
[53:08] are in the process of raising children
[53:10] and raising families in the admonition
[53:13] of God I honor you this morning and
[53:16] above all we honor our father
[53:18] our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you
[53:21] have your Bible's turn with me to the
[53:23] book of Philippians chapter 2 thank you
[53:25] musicians so much
[53:27] and we'll read verses 5 through 8.
[53:33] it's always an honor to stand before you
[53:36] and we certainly thank further Ron for
[53:38] the opportunity to to minister
[53:42] this thought that God has placed on our
[53:44] hearts Philippians chapter 2
[53:47] we'll read verses 5 through 8. it says
[53:51] let this mind be in you which was also
[53:55] in Christ Jesus
[53:57] who being in the form of God thought it
[54:00] not robbery to be equal with God
[54:03] notice what he did though
[54:05] but made himself of no reputation
[54:09] though he was equal with God though he
[54:12] was he found it not robbery to be equal
[54:14] with God yet
[54:16] what did he do he found himself
[54:20] and took upon him and made himself of no
[54:23] reputation
[54:25] instead of going the highway instead of
[54:28] being proud and boastful guess what he
[54:29] did he took the low way
[54:32] and took upon him the form of a servant
[54:35] and was made in the likeness of man
[54:39] and being found in the fashion as a man
[54:43] he humbled himself
[54:45] and became obedient unto death even the
[54:49] death of the cross
[54:52] I've been pondering upon this this
[54:55] thought this scripture in verse ate
[54:58] there and though he being found in the
[55:00] fashion as a man he yet he he humbled
[55:04] himself I won't preach on it this
[55:06] morning but the Lord willing I will
[55:08] preach on it in the future turn with me
[55:10] to the Book of Proverbs chapter 22.
[55:15] and we'll read verse 4.
[55:23] Proverbs chapter 22.
[55:26] and verse 4 it says by humility
[55:29] and the fear of the Lord are riches
[55:32] and honor
[55:34] and life amen may the Lord add the
[55:37] blessing to the reading of the word you
[55:38] may be seated this morning
[55:44] I would like to take
[55:46] for a thought this morning
[55:49] God's School of humility
[55:53] and I would like to take for a subject
[55:56] of Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[56:00] and so my original thought that I wanted
[56:03] to preach on was upon humility and if
[56:08] the Lord will it is something that I
[56:10] would like to preach on and more in
[56:13] depth in the next few services that I
[56:15] take but the more that I was putting my
[56:19] sermon together and putting my notes
[56:21] together and Gathering my thoughts uh I
[56:24] realized that the Lord was taking me in
[56:27] a direction to perhaps lay a foundation
[56:31] of uh my future services and so I would
[56:36] like to look at Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[56:39] and we realize that we are living in the
[56:43] days where the Bible said that the
[56:46] people would call evil good
[56:49] and they would call good evil
[56:52] it is the days of gross Darkness being
[56:56] Darkness being upon the Earth and gross
[56:59] darkness is upon the people
[57:02] I could say that there's never been a
[57:04] time like this time that we are now
[57:06] living in where there is such a
[57:10] perversion and darkness not only upon
[57:13] the world but upon the people upon
[57:16] Humanity that is dwelling within this
[57:19] world we realize that brother Branham
[57:22] said there was never as dark a time as
[57:25] the day that we are living in right now
[57:28] and what is it that is making it such a
[57:31] dark place it's it's it's it's it's the
[57:34] filth it's the perversion it's the sin
[57:38] it's the calling the good evil and the
[57:40] evil good it's a complete turnaround uh
[57:44] from from the very principles of the
[57:47] Bible that we follow
[57:50] and because we've left God out of our
[57:52] out of our schools because we've left
[57:54] God out of our homes because we have
[57:57] taken God uh out of the government and
[58:00] all these different things when you take
[58:01] light away there's nothing but Darkness
[58:06] but the Bible also says that in the
[58:09] evening time there shall be light and so
[58:12] we're thankful that though we are living
[58:15] in the darkest hour that this Earth has
[58:18] ever seen and though there's gross
[58:20] Darkness upon the people and though
[58:22] there's evil all around us we realize
[58:24] that we are also living in the day of
[58:27] the greatest light that has ever shone
[58:30] we are living in a time where this word
[58:33] that has been sealed up and it has been
[58:36] closed for centuries has now been opened
[58:39] and revealed unto us the Bride of Jesus
[58:42] Christ
[58:45] that's why there's light
[58:47] that's why there's light in Goshen this
[58:49] morning why because the word has been
[58:51] revealed and it has been opened unto us
[58:56] brother Branham would often sing that
[58:58] song it shall be light
[59:01] about the evening time the path to Glory
[59:05] ye shall surely find
[59:06] through the water away it is the light
[59:09] today buried in the precious name of
[59:12] Jesus what is it that shining before us
[59:16] it's the very word of God so it's very
[59:19] easy for us as Believers to
[59:22] we have two options we can either look
[59:26] at the darkness we can either look at
[59:28] the sin and the perversion that's around
[59:30] us or we can look at the light of God we
[59:34] have a choice this morning we can look
[59:36] at those things that pull us down as
[59:38] Believers we can look at those things
[59:40] which which gives us a depression Upon
[59:43] Our Lives or we can look at the promises
[59:46] of God or we can look at the light and
[59:49] walk in the light as he is in the light
[59:52] what are you choosing this morning
[59:57] it all depends on what dog we're feeding
[59:59] doesn't it
[1:00:01] Hallelujah
[1:00:07] praise the Lord
[1:00:09] the little kids last week they sang
[1:00:12] This Little Light of Mine
[1:00:14] I'm gonna let it shine
[1:00:16] you know it's easy to shine your light
[1:00:18] when there's Darkness all around
[1:00:20] you don't gotta preach somebody a sermon
[1:00:22] you don't gotta know all the The Depths
[1:00:25] and the ins and outs and the ups and
[1:00:27] downs and and and and the great
[1:00:29] Mysteries of the word just live a life
[1:00:32] and you living a life that is different
[1:00:34] from everybody else is letting your
[1:00:36] light shine so let your light shine
[1:00:39] don't let it just be for a song for the
[1:00:42] little kids but let it be for the middle
[1:00:44] age the elders and all of us put
[1:00:47] together let our lights shine before
[1:00:50] this world
[1:00:53] so we find out that it's this day that
[1:00:56] we're living in is the Fulfillment of
[1:00:59] second Timothy chapter three one through
[1:01:02] five turn with me if you will
[1:01:07] second Timothy chapter 3 verses one
[1:01:10] through five and it says this no also
[1:01:14] that in the last days perilous times
[1:01:17] shall come so when perilous times comes
[1:01:21] in our lives guess what it shouldn't be
[1:01:23] this great uh uh what's the word
[1:01:27] surprise
[1:01:28] ah
[1:01:30] I'm surprised
[1:01:33] shocker perilous times are amongst us
[1:01:36] yeah because the Bible says so
[1:01:39] now notice the characteristics of this
[1:01:41] for man shall be lovers of their own
[1:01:43] selves Covetous boasters proud
[1:01:48] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:01:50] unthankful and Unholy without natural
[1:01:54] affection truth Breakers false accusers
[1:01:57] incontinent fears despisers of those
[1:02:00] that are good
[1:02:01] they'll be traitors they'll be heading
[1:02:03] high-minded lover of Pleasures more than
[1:02:06] loving of God having a form of godliness
[1:02:09] notice they have a form of godliness but
[1:02:12] they deny the power thereof from such
[1:02:16] turn away
[1:02:18] mankind has become so proud
[1:02:22] mankind has become so arrogant they've
[1:02:26] become so boastful in themselves for who
[1:02:29] they are and what they believe in
[1:02:31] of course we know what month it is and
[1:02:34] it's it's pride month
[1:02:36] and you know a day isn't good enough no
[1:02:38] more
[1:02:40] it went from a day to a week now it goes
[1:02:42] from a week to a month and and it's a
[1:02:44] time where everybody that that once hid
[1:02:48] in a closet
[1:02:49] that people that once had a little bit
[1:02:52] of uh uh moral decency about them to say
[1:02:55] this this this life that I'm living I I
[1:02:59] ought to be hiding it I shouldn't be
[1:03:01] proud of it because I know it's wrong I
[1:03:04] know it's not natural uh uh and it used
[1:03:07] to be that they would be in the closet
[1:03:09] because so to speak
[1:03:12] why was that because they had enough
[1:03:15] common decency to know that it's not
[1:03:17] right
[1:03:19] but now we're living in a day where
[1:03:21] times are very rapidly changing amongst
[1:03:24] us where people are not only coming out
[1:03:27] of the closet but they're encouraged to
[1:03:29] come out of the closet they're
[1:03:31] encouraged to be proud they're
[1:03:33] encouraged to be boastful they're in
[1:03:35] they're encouraged to rub it in your
[1:03:37] face of what they believe in
[1:03:42] I wonder what would happen if we as
[1:03:44] Believers as Christians
[1:03:46] had a day of pride
[1:03:49] for who we are and what we believe in
[1:03:51] and all these different things my
[1:03:53] goodness and there be riots all over the
[1:03:55] place
[1:03:56] we it would there would be they would uh
[1:03:59] label us as hate crime and hate this and
[1:04:02] all that just because we're believers
[1:04:06] it's getting to a point where a Believer
[1:04:07] doesn't have a a leg to stand on
[1:04:15] but it's okay
[1:04:16] because perilous times guess what
[1:04:18] they're going to come
[1:04:25] that's right
[1:04:28] what are they proud of is the question
[1:04:33] they're proud of how they're living
[1:04:36] they're proud of the thoughts and the
[1:04:38] desires in their heart really when we
[1:04:40] boil it down to one thing they're proud
[1:04:43] of sin
[1:04:47] what is it it's not just well this
[1:04:50] person wants to live this kind of life
[1:04:52] and do this over here yeah they're not
[1:04:54] just proud of that they're proud of sin
[1:04:59] they're not proud of of living a
[1:05:01] righteous life they're not proud of of
[1:05:03] living a life of decency but they're
[1:05:05] proud of sin and their life and they
[1:05:08] want everybody else to know about it
[1:05:13] isn't that how Satan is
[1:05:15] oh my when proud was found in his heart
[1:05:19] that's why they're all proud because
[1:05:21] they're all like their father
[1:05:26] God help us
[1:05:29] you're trying to say brother Stephen
[1:05:31] that everybody that lives in unclean
[1:05:32] life like this can't be safe definitely
[1:05:34] not
[1:05:35] but it'll take the grace of almighty God
[1:05:38] just like it did you and I
[1:05:46] they like to say that I am who I am and
[1:05:49] this is how God made me to be
[1:05:53] well they're correct in a certain way
[1:05:56] but they're just talking about the wrong
[1:05:57] God they're not talking about the
[1:06:00] creator of heavens and earth but they're
[1:06:02] talking about the God of this evil age
[1:06:08] Satan's eat in 1965 brother Branham said
[1:06:10] now he by this fall it has took over and
[1:06:14] possessed the Garden of Eden himself
[1:06:16] he's talking about Satan he took it over
[1:06:19] and now he has had six thousand years of
[1:06:22] deceitful rule deceiving the people
[1:06:26] God's children as he did then because
[1:06:30] they were based on free moral agency to
[1:06:33] act any way they wish to and believing
[1:06:35] that they would act right or trusting
[1:06:37] they would act right then they've come
[1:06:39] with the wrong act and sold their birth
[1:06:41] rights as Esau did for the world
[1:06:44] and Satan won it and he took it over and
[1:06:47] he said six thousand years to build up
[1:06:49] his Eden as God had six thousand years
[1:06:52] to bring his Eden to a close and by
[1:06:54] deceit deceit of the word or the people
[1:06:58] now established his own Eden in this
[1:07:01] earth in sin so he took the word but he
[1:07:07] used the word and he preached it in
[1:07:09] deceit
[1:07:10] and by preaching the word and deceit it
[1:07:14] brought forth sin and the lives of God's
[1:07:17] children
[1:07:20] see how important it is for the ministry
[1:07:22] to hold a standard how important it is
[1:07:25] for the ministry to preach the word
[1:07:27] without fear or favor you see how easy
[1:07:31] it is to get off and deceit to get off
[1:07:33] the wrong track to get off the path of
[1:07:36] the written word
[1:07:40] I pray that my Ministry is a Ministry
[1:07:42] that doesn't sugar sugarcoat anything
[1:07:45] I don't want to be a sugar coder but I
[1:07:48] want to be a minister of the word
[1:07:52] because at the end of the day it brings
[1:07:53] forth fruit
[1:07:55] you sugarcoat the word you're going to
[1:07:57] bring you're going to bring forth a
[1:07:59] sugar-coated Christian
[1:08:01] brother Branham would say a hybrid
[1:08:03] Christian
[1:08:04] somebody who has to be babied somebody
[1:08:06] who has to be uh petted along the ways
[1:08:09] and brother Brennan said that's not a
[1:08:11] real true Christian a true Christian has
[1:08:13] a backbone a true Christian will stand
[1:08:16] upon the principles of the word a true
[1:08:19] Christian will stand upon their
[1:08:20] convictions no matter what the world
[1:08:22] says
[1:08:26] just because the government is trying to
[1:08:29] push things and say that things are okay
[1:08:31] and that things are right it doesn't
[1:08:34] mean that they are okay and that they
[1:08:36] are right
[1:08:37] because really they have their own
[1:08:40] agenda and their their agenda is not
[1:08:43] preaching the word but their agenda is
[1:08:46] anti-word and deceit which is going to
[1:08:49] lead to sin
[1:08:52] so what's up to us now as Believers not
[1:08:55] to get on Instagram and get on Facebook
[1:08:57] and put our quotes on there and
[1:09:00] absolutely tear everybody apart and
[1:09:02] comment on different things no our uh
[1:09:05] it's up to us to raise our friends and
[1:09:08] our children and our families and those
[1:09:10] around us to raise us together
[1:09:15] to raise one another in the admonition
[1:09:18] of God to help one another and to speak
[1:09:21] truth one to another
[1:09:25] you've got to get out here and blast
[1:09:26] everybody
[1:09:28] but within the house of God but within
[1:09:31] the family of God we need to remind
[1:09:34] ourselves of Truth
[1:09:38] because guess what they're going to keep
[1:09:40] trying to pressure it they're going to
[1:09:42] keep trying to push it they're going to
[1:09:44] keep pushing their agendas on our
[1:09:46] families they're going to keep pushing
[1:09:48] their agendas on our children on our
[1:09:50] loved ones and they're going to make it
[1:09:52] hard to live if you don't go along with
[1:09:55] their agendas
[1:09:59] is not a time to be high
[1:10:02] now is not a time for a sugar-coated
[1:10:05] sermon now is not a time for us as
[1:10:08] Believers to live a sugar-coated life
[1:10:10] and to sympathize with sin
[1:10:14] but now is the time for us to stand Upon
[1:10:17] Our Own two feet and to stand Upon Our
[1:10:20] convictions
[1:10:24] Hallelujah
[1:10:25] say brother Stephen I am I am doing that
[1:10:28] well God bless you continue to do so but
[1:10:32] what happens is too much of the time we
[1:10:35] begin to sympathize
[1:10:37] well that's just how God made them and
[1:10:40] you know your children will come home
[1:10:42] and next thing you want to you want to
[1:10:43] sugarcoat and say well that's okay no
[1:10:45] it's not okay
[1:10:48] that's not truth
[1:10:53] they don't like truth
[1:10:56] when you tell the truth
[1:11:00] it comes forth as hatred
[1:11:04] when you tell the truth to somebody and
[1:11:06] say no according to God's word that is
[1:11:09] not true you'll be known as as someone
[1:11:11] that hates another person for how they
[1:11:14] feel that they are no I'm just telling
[1:11:17] truth
[1:11:20] what is truth
[1:11:23] Jesus stood before Pilate well what is
[1:11:26] truth I am the truth the way and the
[1:11:31] life and what is he he is the revealed
[1:11:33] word for the hour in which we're living
[1:11:36] in
[1:11:37] it's not just a man of History who died
[1:11:40] upon a cross for our sins but he's a
[1:11:43] Living Word
[1:11:45] and when you take that Living Word and
[1:11:47] you eat that Living Word you become the
[1:11:49] Living Word
[1:11:52] that's what he is in this hour
[1:11:55] he is not dead but he is alive it is not
[1:11:58] a dead letter but it is a letter that is
[1:12:01] alive and inspired
[1:12:05] you say I wonder what God thinks of all
[1:12:08] these things that's going on amongst us
[1:12:09] we'll just read the words you'll find
[1:12:11] out
[1:12:12] because he doesn't change his mind he
[1:12:15] doesn't change his ways as he saw
[1:12:18] something and and it was inspired and
[1:12:21] pinned down by by by prophets of God
[1:12:24] guess what what they wrote is still good
[1:12:26] enough for this day in this hour
[1:12:32] foreign
[1:12:38] now Satan established his own Eden and
[1:12:41] uh his own Eden in this earth in sin
[1:12:46] paragraph 61. God's Eden was established
[1:12:49] in righteousness Satan's Eden is
[1:12:52] established in sin because Satan is sin
[1:12:57] how simple is that
[1:13:01] God is righteousness and God's kingdom
[1:13:04] was established in righteousness and
[1:13:07] peace and life and Satan's establishment
[1:13:10] is in sin and religious sin
[1:13:16] religious what is a religious sin it has
[1:13:20] taken the word and preaching it in
[1:13:23] deceit trying to tickle the ears of the
[1:13:26] people trying to tell the people what
[1:13:29] they think they want to hear
[1:13:31] well it's okay for you to go on through
[1:13:33] this it's all right God knows your heart
[1:13:35] yeah you do those things your heart is
[1:13:38] full of sin
[1:13:41] God keep our hearts pure
[1:13:45] Lord that we can apply the word to our
[1:13:48] hearts
[1:13:51] because out of the heart
[1:13:54] that's where the life flows
[1:14:01] God help us not to get religious
[1:14:04] amen
[1:14:06] so we find out that Satan is the ruler
[1:14:08] of the kingdoms of this Earth
[1:14:10] he proved it once when he took Jesus up
[1:14:13] to a high mountain and a pit up there
[1:14:15] and he looked at all the kingdoms it was
[1:14:18] and all the kingdoms that would ever be
[1:14:20] and he said if you'll just Bow Down and
[1:14:22] Worship me all these kingdoms I'll give
[1:14:25] them to you how could he give something
[1:14:27] to Jesus that was not his so from the
[1:14:31] Garden of Eden When sin was introduced
[1:14:33] and he began to preach his Gospel of sin
[1:14:37] by deceit of the word we realize now
[1:14:41] that he took over the kingdoms of this
[1:14:44] Earth
[1:14:48] laughs
[1:14:50] so we find out that these the kingdoms
[1:14:53] of this Earth
[1:14:55] when we read about the dream of
[1:14:57] Nebuchadnezzar we see that this dream is
[1:15:02] a foreshadow of the kingdoms that was to
[1:15:05] come upon this Earth
[1:15:08] Daniel chapter 2 verses 31 through 45.
[1:15:13] thou O King sawest and behold a great
[1:15:16] image
[1:15:17] this great image whose brightness was
[1:15:20] excellent stood before thee and the form
[1:15:22] thereof was terrible
[1:15:25] this image's head was of fine gold his
[1:15:28] breast and his arms of silver his belly
[1:15:32] and his thighs of brass
[1:15:35] and so we can take the word now and each
[1:15:39] of these medals is a a symbol of
[1:15:43] something it is a meaning of something
[1:15:47] thou saw us till us uh
[1:15:51] his legs of iron his feet part of iron
[1:15:55] and part of clay thou saw us till a
[1:15:58] stone was cut out without hands which
[1:16:00] smote the image upon his feet that were
[1:16:03] of iron and clay and break them to
[1:16:05] Pieces then was the iron the clay the
[1:16:08] brass the silver and the gold broke into
[1:16:10] pieces together and became like the
[1:16:13] chaff of the summer threshing floors and
[1:16:15] the wind carried them away that no place
[1:16:17] was found for them
[1:16:19] and the stone that smote the image
[1:16:21] became a great mountain and filled the
[1:16:24] whole Earth
[1:16:25] this is the dream and we will tell the
[1:16:27] interpretation thereof before the king
[1:16:30] thou O King are the King of Kings for
[1:16:33] the god of Heaven hath given thee a
[1:16:35] kingdom power and strength and Glory
[1:16:38] and where wheresoever the children of
[1:16:41] men dwell the beasts of the field and
[1:16:43] the fowls of the heaven hath given into
[1:16:45] thine hand and hath made the ruler over
[1:16:48] them all thou art this head of gold and
[1:16:51] after thee shall arise another kingdom
[1:16:53] inferior to thee in another third
[1:16:55] Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule
[1:16:58] over all the earth and the fourth
[1:17:00] Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as
[1:17:02] much as iron breakth and pieces and
[1:17:04] subdueth all things and as iron that
[1:17:07] breaketh all these shall it break in
[1:17:09] pieces and bruise and whereas thou saws
[1:17:12] defeat and Toes part of Potter's clay
[1:17:15] and part of iron the kingdom shall be
[1:17:17] divided but there shall be in it of the
[1:17:19] strength of the iron for as much as thou
[1:17:22] saws they are and mixed with Maori clay
[1:17:25] and as the toes of the feet were part of
[1:17:28] iron and part of clay so the kingdom
[1:17:30] shall be partly strong and partly broken
[1:17:33] and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with
[1:17:37] Clay they shall mingle themselves with
[1:17:40] the seed of men but they shall not
[1:17:43] cleave one to another even as iron is
[1:17:46] not mixed with clay
[1:17:47] and in the days of these Kings shall the
[1:17:50] god of Heaven set up a kingdom which
[1:17:52] shall never be destroyed and the kingdom
[1:17:55] shall not be left to other people but it
[1:17:58] shall break in pieces and consume all
[1:18:00] these kingdoms and it shall stand
[1:18:02] forever and everybody said amen for as
[1:18:05] much as thou saw us that the stone was
[1:18:07] cut out of the mountain without hands
[1:18:09] and that it break in pieces the iron the
[1:18:11] brass the clay silver and gold the great
[1:18:14] God hath made known to the king what
[1:18:16] shall come to pass Hereafter and the
[1:18:18] dream is certain and the interpretation
[1:18:21] thereof is sure
[1:18:26] the King was asking a very hard and
[1:18:30] difficult thing at this time
[1:18:32] when you read the story we find that he
[1:18:35] had this dream and um and he wanted his
[1:18:38] his musicians and magicians and all the
[1:18:42] different wise men of that day to to not
[1:18:45] only tell the king what the dream was
[1:18:48] but also to give the interpretation
[1:18:50] thereof
[1:18:52] and it got to a point where everybody
[1:18:54] thought my goodness this is an
[1:18:57] impossible feat for man to do and that
[1:19:01] was true but it what is impossible for
[1:19:04] man is possible for God
[1:19:07] and so the king here at this time he was
[1:19:10] going to put all the wise men to death
[1:19:13] because they were unable to tell him of
[1:19:16] his dream
[1:19:17] because no doubt he knew if they can
[1:19:19] tell me what the dream is the
[1:19:22] interpretation of the dream will also be
[1:19:24] correct
[1:19:26] and so Daniel came up and not only did
[1:19:29] he mention what tell the king exactly
[1:19:32] what the dream was but he was able to
[1:19:34] give the interpretation of the dream and
[1:19:37] so brother Branham he would take this
[1:19:39] and he would say uh a man that is able
[1:19:42] to interpret dreams and visions and what
[1:19:46] they mean he should be able to tell the
[1:19:49] person what the dream was that they
[1:19:51] dreamed before they gave the the
[1:19:53] interpretation
[1:19:55] otherwise you get people out here and
[1:19:58] they're just saying well this is a
[1:20:00] symbol and your dream means this and
[1:20:03] this uh this is a sword and it's a
[1:20:05] two-aged sword and that means the word
[1:20:07] and on and on and on and it's just a
[1:20:09] bunch of uh uh carnality
[1:20:13] it's just a bunch of people that are
[1:20:15] that are going before men and saying
[1:20:17] well well if interpret me this dream
[1:20:19] interpret to me this dream
[1:20:22] they can just make up something
[1:20:24] and what happens is that people have so
[1:20:27] much confidence in the man
[1:20:30] that they'll believe anything that he
[1:20:32] says
[1:20:33] but brother Brown on me he put that to
[1:20:35] rest people would come before him and he
[1:20:38] would say this is the dream that you had
[1:20:39] and therefore this is the interpretation
[1:20:42] thereof therefore the interpretation is
[1:20:46] not of man
[1:20:49] but it's of God
[1:20:53] so we understand that this Vision that
[1:20:56] Nebuchadnezzar had it makes up a picture
[1:21:00] of a man
[1:21:01] and this picture is symbolic of the
[1:21:06] times of the Gentiles
[1:21:10] everybody knows that right
[1:21:12] and so do we have that picture uh there
[1:21:15] it is
[1:21:17] and so here we have this this statue
[1:21:21] this of this dream that Nebuchadnezzar
[1:21:23] had and and it was the head of gold and
[1:21:26] we see the arms and the chest of silver
[1:21:29] we see that there was there was the the
[1:21:32] the belly and the thighs were of bronze
[1:21:35] and the thighs and the legs and the feet
[1:21:38] were of clay and so we understand too
[1:21:41] the Bible said that the feet was a
[1:21:43] mixture of clay and of iron
[1:21:46] so all of these things for us as
[1:21:49] Believers we can read it and we can look
[1:21:52] at the pictures and we can say my well
[1:21:55] what a fantastic dream that is I wonder
[1:21:58] what it means I wonder about these
[1:22:01] kingdoms of when they were and what
[1:22:03] happened and I and and and I wonder what
[1:22:06] exactly this stands for understand
[1:22:09] there's always a a spiritual aspect to
[1:22:13] symbols and pictures within the
[1:22:15] scripture
[1:22:18] and so we can actually take this
[1:22:21] scripture we can take this picture and
[1:22:25] we can actually break it apart
[1:22:27] and we can apply it to our lives in this
[1:22:31] day in which we are living
[1:22:33] because what good is it to to preach a
[1:22:36] sermon that's full of symbols what good
[1:22:38] is it to preach a sermon that is full of
[1:22:41] inspiration are not full full of
[1:22:43] information and full of symbols and full
[1:22:47] of these things and it does absolutely
[1:22:49] nothing to us in our daily walks
[1:22:51] at that point it's just information
[1:22:54] at that point it's just nice words at
[1:22:57] that point it is just history
[1:23:00] but if we can take it from history if we
[1:23:03] can take the symbols and we can break it
[1:23:05] apart and apply it to our lives it'll
[1:23:08] help us in our daily walks
[1:23:13] God help us this morning
[1:23:16] and you can just leave that picture up
[1:23:18] that's fine
[1:23:20] um so we find that the first kingdom is
[1:23:24] the Babylonian Kingdom and if you want a
[1:23:28] lot of quotes and stuff for this you can
[1:23:30] go and and brother Branham says a lot of
[1:23:32] things about the head of gold and just
[1:23:34] type in head of gold
[1:23:36] you'll get 40 or 50 quotes that brings
[1:23:40] this all up of the teachings of what
[1:23:42] brother Branham said this was
[1:23:45] we find out that this head of gold was
[1:23:48] the Babylonian Kingdom
[1:23:50] and brother Branham said that this
[1:23:52] Kingdom first began by Kush who was the
[1:23:56] son of ham does everybody remember who
[1:23:59] the son of ham was
[1:24:01] ham was the son of Noah
[1:24:04] so Noah had three sons ham sham and
[1:24:09] japheth that survived the great flood
[1:24:12] that God caused upon to come upon the
[1:24:15] Earth and he had three sons and one of
[1:24:18] these sons was called ham I'm making it
[1:24:21] very simple so that everybody can
[1:24:23] understand because some of you guys yeah
[1:24:25] guess what you don't read your Bibles
[1:24:27] ham I never heard of ham
[1:24:30] well if I say Noah he'll go I know Noah
[1:24:34] I learned that in Sunday school it's not
[1:24:37] good enough to just learn things in
[1:24:38] Sunday school but you gotta read your
[1:24:41] Bible yourself
[1:24:42] so that when the minister says something
[1:24:44] you go oh I remember ham
[1:24:47] you know how ham was the bad one
[1:24:50] ham is a pig
[1:24:53] and pigs for the Jews is bad right
[1:24:57] they weren't allowed to eat pork weren't
[1:24:59] allowed to eat ham so ham was the bad
[1:25:02] one
[1:25:03] or could I say he was up the seat of the
[1:25:06] serpent
[1:25:09] so now here was ham
[1:25:12] who was the son of Noah who had a son
[1:25:14] who was called Kush and he began to make
[1:25:17] this Babylonian uh City and his son was
[1:25:22] called nimrod
[1:25:24] Brother Martin is going to be so happy
[1:25:27] with me this morning
[1:25:31] so Nimrod the Bible says was a great
[1:25:34] warrior
[1:25:35] a great hunter Genesis 10 verses 8
[1:25:38] through 9 and Kush begat Nimrod and he
[1:25:42] began to be a mighty one in the earth he
[1:25:45] was a mighty Hunter before the Lord
[1:25:47] wherefore it is said even as Nimrod the
[1:25:50] mighty Hunter before the Lord
[1:25:54] now we realize that brother Branham said
[1:25:57] that through Nimrod as the beginning of
[1:26:01] all idolatry
[1:26:03] as the beginning of all paganism as the
[1:26:06] beginning of all the worship of the son
[1:26:09] and of the stars and the moons and all
[1:26:12] these different things that's why
[1:26:13] brother Branham said that all of their
[1:26:16] denominational ideas and everything that
[1:26:20] we see upon the Earth right now it All
[1:26:22] Began in Genesis
[1:26:25] it all began with Nimrod because Nimrod
[1:26:29] he had a purpose within his heart and
[1:26:32] within his life
[1:26:36] why
[1:26:37] why would he bring in idolatry why would
[1:26:40] he bring in a paganism why would he
[1:26:43] bring in a worship of something uh that
[1:26:46] was different than what they knew was
[1:26:48] true because Satan is always taking the
[1:26:53] word that is true and he is beguiling
[1:26:56] the people to believe a Lie by the truth
[1:27:01] so he'll take a little bit of Truth and
[1:27:04] he allowed one word to it and he'll take
[1:27:06] away one word from here and by doing so
[1:27:09] by doing so he's taken the people off
[1:27:12] the right track but why did he do it why
[1:27:14] is he purposing in his heart to do this
[1:27:16] because he's of the wrong seat because
[1:27:19] the seed of God will always stay with
[1:27:22] the word
[1:27:27] so when did this this paganism and the
[1:27:31] worship of of of of of animals and stars
[1:27:34] and all the different things that that
[1:27:36] people worship from that time since the
[1:27:39] fall of God and Eden until now it all
[1:27:42] started with the head of gold Babylon
[1:27:45] through nimrod
[1:27:51] we find that it begins with the head
[1:27:56] and it goes right down through the body
[1:27:58] to the feet
[1:28:00] understand it's the same spirit
[1:28:04] it's the same devil
[1:28:06] it's the same deceitfulness that started
[1:28:09] in Genesis that ends in Revelation
[1:28:13] the Beast and the beginning is the same
[1:28:16] beast that's in the end he changes not
[1:28:20] he just changes his mask he he he
[1:28:22] changes the word that he brings once in
[1:28:25] a while but it's the same devil
[1:28:28] and notice he starts from the head to
[1:28:30] the feet where does the church begin it
[1:28:33] begins at the bottom it begins with
[1:28:35] humility
[1:28:39] but yet this these kingdoms it begins
[1:28:42] and it starts with the head
[1:28:47] so we find that it starts in the head
[1:28:49] and it goes to the feet
[1:28:51] now what is so interesting about the
[1:28:53] fetus brother Branham said that
[1:28:55] footsteps are possession
[1:28:59] and we understand that this iron and is
[1:29:03] is absolutely the Roman Catholic Church
[1:29:06] it was it was papal Rome that failed
[1:29:09] there was Pagan Rome that fell
[1:29:12] and it was given life back into papal
[1:29:14] room and why was it until the end time
[1:29:17] why was why was it not that clay mixed
[1:29:20] in with the hands and all these
[1:29:21] different things because it was mixed
[1:29:23] into the feet because there's Doctrine
[1:29:25] this paganism has walked throughout
[1:29:28] every country upon planet Earth
[1:29:31] possessing footsteps possessing by lies
[1:29:36] possessing by deceit possessing by fear
[1:29:39] possessing with a rod of iron
[1:29:45] Allelujah
[1:29:47] it's the same spirit
[1:29:49] the same Antichrist spirit that began to
[1:29:52] ride as a white horse rider is the same
[1:29:55] one when he begins to ride in his
[1:29:58] black horse or Pale Horse whatever it
[1:30:00] wanted is
[1:30:01] it's the same devil it's the same Spirit
[1:30:04] of antichrist he's just changing his
[1:30:07] horse he says changing his mask every
[1:30:09] time it's the same one we're telling the
[1:30:11] same story only through a different
[1:30:13] symbol
[1:30:14] it begins with the head of gold that
[1:30:16] ends in the feet
[1:30:20] now I'm giving the information I'm
[1:30:24] giving the symbols but at the end we'll
[1:30:26] bring it down to our lives
[1:30:29] otherwise it's just nice
[1:30:31] I was informative how was the sermon
[1:30:33] informative
[1:30:35] it was nice
[1:30:36] I learned about the history of the
[1:30:38] church fantastic
[1:30:40] how's that going to help you I don't
[1:30:42] know
[1:30:43] but it was nice and it was good
[1:30:46] God help us to take the information
[1:30:49] and that we can give the Revelation
[1:30:52] towards applicable to us from the
[1:30:55] youngest to the oldest
[1:31:01] now
[1:31:02] so it starts with the head and next it
[1:31:05] goes to the silver
[1:31:08] of the arms and of the chest area and we
[1:31:12] brother Branham said that that kingdom
[1:31:14] was the medo-persian Empire of the
[1:31:18] breast and arms of silver
[1:31:22] now remember that the Babylonians were
[1:31:25] the ones that first destroyed the temple
[1:31:28] in Jerusalem
[1:31:30] that's why Daniel was in Babylon
[1:31:34] because Nebuchadnezzar had come the and
[1:31:36] and the Babylonians they had taken the
[1:31:39] Jews they had destroyed the first temple
[1:31:42] they had taken captive all the the
[1:31:44] goodly young man and the wise man and
[1:31:47] now they were using them for their own
[1:31:49] pleasure and so now here was Daniel as a
[1:31:53] Jew in Babylon interpreting this dream
[1:31:57] from Nebuchadnezzar that's why he was
[1:31:58] there he was a captive
[1:32:01] now at that time
[1:32:03] God raised up this uh this middle uh
[1:32:08] Persian Empire for one purpose and that
[1:32:12] was to destroy Babylon and God would use
[1:32:16] King Cyrus to cause the Jews to return
[1:32:19] to Jerusalem for the rebuilding of the
[1:32:22] Temple so we find out that God is the
[1:32:25] one that raised up this next Empire but
[1:32:28] though God is the one that raised it up
[1:32:30] to bring to pass his word yet Satan uses
[1:32:35] that same thing now and he perverts it
[1:32:38] because that's what Satan does he is a
[1:32:41] perverter of the things that God is
[1:32:43] doing
[1:32:45] notice this Ezra chapter 1 verses 1
[1:32:48] through 4. now in the first year of
[1:32:50] Cyrus King of Persia that the word of
[1:32:53] the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might
[1:32:55] be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the
[1:32:58] spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that he
[1:33:01] made a proclamation throughout all his
[1:33:03] kingdom and put it also in writing
[1:33:05] saying thus saith Cyrus King of Persia
[1:33:08] the Lord God Of Heaven hath given me all
[1:33:11] the kingdoms of the earth and he has
[1:33:13] charged me to build him and house at
[1:33:16] Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there
[1:33:19] among you of all his people
[1:33:22] his God be with him and let him go up to
[1:33:25] Jerusalem which is in Judah and build
[1:33:27] the house of the Lord God of Israel he
[1:33:30] is the god which is in Jerusalem and
[1:33:33] whosoever remaineth in any place where
[1:33:35] he sojourneth let the man of of his
[1:33:38] place help him with silver and with gold
[1:33:40] and with goods and with beasts beside
[1:33:43] the Free Will offering for the house of
[1:33:45] God that is in Jerusalem
[1:33:49] so we find out from at that point now
[1:33:52] what what was God doing God was taking
[1:33:56] away this Babylonian Empire now God had
[1:34:00] raised up this Babylonian Empire because
[1:34:02] the Jews man there are hard-hearted
[1:34:05] people aren't they they're stiff-necked
[1:34:07] people it didn't matter how many times
[1:34:09] that God would deliver them they would
[1:34:11] always go right back into sin again they
[1:34:14] always had whenever the man of God
[1:34:16] whenever that judge would raise up they
[1:34:19] would follow him and they would be they
[1:34:20] would be good and they would be faithful
[1:34:22] but when he would that judge would pass
[1:34:24] away what would happen to Israel they
[1:34:26] would go right back into their idolatry
[1:34:28] again they would go right back into
[1:34:30] living in their sin again and I think us
[1:34:33] as Gentiles sometimes were very much
[1:34:36] like Jewish people we got a hard heart
[1:34:39] we got a stiff neck every time that God
[1:34:43] delivers us from something guess what
[1:34:44] we're doing going right back into it
[1:34:46] again not too much longer later
[1:34:49] God help us
[1:34:51] you say well if the pastor was just
[1:34:53] there or if the minister was just there
[1:34:55] and hey what are you doing by yourself
[1:34:58] you need to learn how to overcome Satan
[1:35:01] by yourself in your own territory
[1:35:04] because there will be times when there's
[1:35:06] no one else around to help you
[1:35:10] you got to learn to stand alone on the
[1:35:13] Promises of God and learn to overcome
[1:35:16] the thoughts of Satan that he puts in
[1:35:18] your mind
[1:35:25] so it was pretty interesting that God
[1:35:27] had raised up Babylon for this purpose
[1:35:29] but when his purpose was fulfilled now
[1:35:31] he's raising up somebody else now he's
[1:35:33] raising up another Empire now he's
[1:35:35] raising up another kingdom to do away
[1:35:37] with this Kingdom because this Kingdom
[1:35:39] fulfilled his purpose
[1:35:41] because it was time for the Jews to go
[1:35:44] back in their Homeland and so not only
[1:35:47] did he raise up this Empire and not only
[1:35:49] did he raise up this King but he also
[1:35:52] said hey I'm going to send you money I'm
[1:35:54] going to give you gold I'm going to give
[1:35:56] you silver and beasts and whatever it is
[1:35:58] that you need I'm gonna help you along
[1:36:01] the way to build this Temple God has
[1:36:03] given us everything that we need for the
[1:36:06] journey
[1:36:07] it's all written within the word
[1:36:11] thank you Lord
[1:36:17] so the next Empire
[1:36:20] was the Grecian Empire and that's the
[1:36:23] belly and thighs of brass we move on
[1:36:27] from there we go down to the Roman
[1:36:29] Empire of the legs and feet of iron and
[1:36:33] clay
[1:36:35] so we realize that
[1:36:37] God has done something which is very
[1:36:42] special and and he would raise up
[1:36:45] kingdoms and cause kingdoms to fall and
[1:36:48] he would raise up an Empire and when
[1:36:50] that Empire fulfilled its purpose guess
[1:36:53] what he would cause that Empire to fall
[1:36:56] and so we see that no matter what goes
[1:36:59] on around us it's all in the will and
[1:37:02] plan of God almighty
[1:37:04] what we have to do as Believers is just
[1:37:07] put Trust
[1:37:08] in God that he knows what he's doing
[1:37:13] God knows exactly what he is doing his
[1:37:16] timing is perfect and his will is
[1:37:19] perfect which is his word
[1:37:25] so don't worry
[1:37:29] everything's gonna be all right
[1:37:32] everything's gonna be all right
[1:37:36] why is everything going to be all right
[1:37:38] because God is in control
[1:37:49] so we realize that
[1:37:52] if we keep the word as symbols it'll
[1:37:54] never help us
[1:37:56] but if we can take it and if we can
[1:37:58] break it down
[1:37:59] for the day in which we are living we
[1:38:02] realize that God's word is a help unto
[1:38:05] us
[1:38:06] now this statue it is a it resembles our
[1:38:11] Humanity
[1:38:13] it is a statue of a man
[1:38:16] and I believe that if we can take the
[1:38:20] statue and if we can take these these
[1:38:22] precious metals that has been used as
[1:38:24] symbols it'll really help us to
[1:38:27] understand ourselves and our Humanity
[1:38:30] because that's exactly what this is it
[1:38:33] is a statue of the humanity and the
[1:38:36] characteristics of man
[1:38:41] understand Satan has had six thousand
[1:38:43] years to perfect this statue
[1:38:49] so I want you to notice that
[1:38:52] the head of golden as I begin to think
[1:38:55] of this head of gold and what it means
[1:38:58] to us as Believers we realize that out
[1:39:02] of all these Metals this head of gold
[1:39:05] that gold is the most precious out of
[1:39:08] all the metals
[1:39:10] it is the metal that is worth the most
[1:39:13] amount of money it is the metal that is
[1:39:15] most valuable it is the metal that that
[1:39:19] everybody Longs after is gold
[1:39:22] everybody's not longing after iron and
[1:39:25] clay and and Brass no it's gold
[1:39:29] there was a reason why there was a gold
[1:39:31] rush because everybody wanted gold
[1:39:34] because gold was valuable
[1:39:37] now a characteristic about gold is gold
[1:39:41] is out of all these Metals gold is the
[1:39:44] most malleable
[1:39:45] of these metals that we're looking at
[1:39:48] what that means is it is the it is the
[1:39:52] softest out of all the metals it can be
[1:39:55] moldable it can be malleable it can be
[1:39:58] beaten down it can be stretched it can
[1:40:02] be twisted because it is a very soft
[1:40:05] metal
[1:40:07] and I got to thinking and I thought well
[1:40:09] why is it
[1:40:11] of the mind and of and of the head
[1:40:13] because it goes to show us where Satan's
[1:40:18] uh the most valuable places that he
[1:40:21] wants to attack us as humanity and
[1:40:25] that's within our minds
[1:40:28] it's the most important spot for Satan
[1:40:31] brother Branham said that uh the
[1:40:33] greatest battle ever fought is in the
[1:40:36] mind of humanity
[1:40:38] the greatest battle ever fought is not
[1:40:41] with your spouse
[1:40:43] it's not with your husband it's not with
[1:40:45] your teenage children and it's not with
[1:40:48] the dog at home though sometimes it
[1:40:51] feels like it
[1:40:52] but the greatest battle ever fought is
[1:40:55] within our minds against the the darts
[1:40:59] that the enemy likes to throw at us
[1:41:02] and our and our mind being so malleable
[1:41:05] if I could type it as gold
[1:41:08] that some people when you don't
[1:41:10] understand the battle we can be torn in
[1:41:13] so many different ways
[1:41:16] if it can be beaten and it can be
[1:41:18] stressed and you think well this person
[1:41:20] told me this over here and this person
[1:41:22] told me this over here and and this
[1:41:25] person over here and and I just don't
[1:41:27] know what is truth and I don't know what
[1:41:29] the Bible says and I just don't know and
[1:41:31] I don't know and they don't understand
[1:41:32] the battle
[1:41:36] God's word says this but yet my mind
[1:41:39] says this what is happening is this gold
[1:41:42] is being beaten
[1:41:45] it's being Twisted it's being formed
[1:41:47] it's being stretched have you ever been
[1:41:50] there
[1:41:51] or you felt like your mind has just been
[1:41:53] so stretched
[1:41:55] so stretched with stress
[1:41:58] so stressed with the importance of your
[1:42:00] job so stretched with your kids and
[1:42:03] family and all these different things
[1:42:05] that you just don't know which way to
[1:42:07] turn that your mind is just so bombarded
[1:42:11] and you don't know how to get rid of it
[1:42:14] brother Branham says you've got to let
[1:42:17] off the pressure
[1:42:19] you've got to find the pressure valve
[1:42:21] somewhere and press that thing and let
[1:42:23] the air out
[1:42:27] well how do I know
[1:42:30] which thoughts are mine and which
[1:42:31] thoughts are Satan how do I know when
[1:42:34] God speaks to me how do I know brother
[1:42:36] Brenham said it is so simple
[1:42:39] if your thoughts are good it's from God
[1:42:43] but if they're bad guess what it's
[1:42:46] Satan's planting those thoughts in your
[1:42:48] mind
[1:42:49] so simple
[1:42:51] so if I can take that simple quote and I
[1:42:55] can say if I have a thought in my mind
[1:42:57] against a certain situation against a
[1:43:00] certain brother or a certain sister
[1:43:01] within the church and it's not a nice
[1:43:04] goodly God provoking thought it's
[1:43:09] so now what do we do with these thoughts
[1:43:11] that these complexes that come into our
[1:43:13] minds we put up the shield of faith and
[1:43:16] we quench them
[1:43:21] so Brothers David you mean to tell me
[1:43:23] that even if somebody does something
[1:43:25] wrong in me in my life and I have an ill
[1:43:28] thought towards them
[1:43:31] yeah it's from Satan
[1:43:35] because the word of God says this
[1:43:37] forgive
[1:43:39] that you might be forgiven
[1:43:42] so now if there is something that's
[1:43:46] within your mind not your heart
[1:43:48] notice the difference
[1:43:50] I could say I could almost guarantee
[1:43:54] if I was to ask all of you guys put up
[1:43:57] your hand
[1:43:58] those of you that hate one person within
[1:44:01] the assembly hate
[1:44:03] from your heart you hate them
[1:44:06] hate them I despise them my heart yeah
[1:44:08] hate that person
[1:44:09] not one of you would raise your hand
[1:44:15] but if you was to say how many of you
[1:44:17] could raise your hand and say within
[1:44:20] your mind there's someone that really
[1:44:22] gets on your nerves
[1:44:25] my wife isn't here so she can't nudge me
[1:44:28] so that's good and you've had a nil
[1:44:30] thought towards somebody else within the
[1:44:32] assembly all of us would raise our hands
[1:44:34] why because we are humans
[1:44:39] but now the danger is this if you don't
[1:44:43] take care of that thought by the word of
[1:44:45] God and forgive that person when that
[1:44:49] thought goes from the mind to the heart
[1:44:51] sin is conceived
[1:44:53] now let's take the scripture for it
[1:44:55] there's Judas Iscariot it was in his
[1:44:58] mind all the time that at how we might
[1:45:00] uh uh you know uh give the Lord up for
[1:45:03] ransom it was in his mind he was
[1:45:06] thinking about it a lot even when he was
[1:45:08] approached about it it was still in his
[1:45:11] mind
[1:45:12] no doubt he was torn wetter to do it or
[1:45:15] not but the Bible says when Satan
[1:45:18] entered into the
[1:45:20] heart of Judas Iscariot that's when he
[1:45:24] went and betrayed the Lord
[1:45:26] and so the sin when it reaches to the
[1:45:29] heart of the person that's when it
[1:45:32] conceives sin and When sin is conceived
[1:45:34] it brings forth
[1:45:36] death
[1:45:37] so God help us the importance of
[1:45:40] protecting our minds the importance of
[1:45:44] thinking good things about one another
[1:45:46] the importance of thinking upon those
[1:45:49] things which are pure those things which
[1:45:51] are holy those things which are of a
[1:45:54] good report those things which make you
[1:45:56] feel good in the word Lord help us to
[1:45:59] think upon these things because when we
[1:46:02] think upon these things and it goes down
[1:46:05] into our heart it'll bring forth life
[1:46:08] it'll bring forth righteousness it'll
[1:46:11] bring forth forgiveness
[1:46:16] so when we forgive one another
[1:46:19] from our hearts and not just our minds
[1:46:21] what happens the Bible says that when
[1:46:24] you forgive that God will heal our
[1:46:27] diseases
[1:46:31] too much of the time if we have
[1:46:32] something in our heart no matter what it
[1:46:35] may be if we don't forgive for that
[1:46:37] situation God cannot heal our diseases
[1:46:42] you see the importance
[1:46:44] so now we take a very simple thought a
[1:46:48] very simple quotation of thinking on
[1:46:50] good things and a very simple quotation
[1:46:52] on if it's bad it's from Satan but we
[1:46:55] can take it now and we can break that
[1:46:57] thing down and realize hey
[1:47:00] this is actually important for my
[1:47:03] well-being
[1:47:05] it's important for my well-being and my
[1:47:08] mental health as a person but not only
[1:47:11] as a person but as a believer in God
[1:47:14] applying the word to my situation
[1:47:20] Hallelujah
[1:47:22] but the longer that we Fester on things
[1:47:25] and the longer we think upon things in
[1:47:27] our minds
[1:47:28] the greater it becomes
[1:47:31] the greater the complex becomes
[1:47:34] and it turns from a complex and a hatred
[1:47:38] now how do we get this out of our heart
[1:47:42] it'll take something very special from
[1:47:44] God to do it
[1:47:46] but you need and I need to do my due
[1:47:48] diligence
[1:47:50] and realize on a daily basis that my
[1:47:54] thoughts are speaking louder than heaven
[1:47:56] then my words are here upon Earth
[1:48:03] there's some people who are just very
[1:48:05] naturally gifted at forgiving others
[1:48:09] there is I could name I could name a
[1:48:12] handful right now and I won't do it
[1:48:13] because I won't embarrass anybody
[1:48:15] but there's some hey guess what we just
[1:48:18] hold grudges
[1:48:21] Amos said yeah right so everybody's
[1:48:23] thinking the old grudges he's actually
[1:48:25] one That Forgives
[1:48:28] it's true
[1:48:29] this guy that he somebody says sorry
[1:48:33] he's over it
[1:48:35] and I'm thinking to myself how is that
[1:48:38] possible
[1:48:40] it's a Godly attribute
[1:48:42] further on is the same way
[1:48:45] remember it's just
[1:48:47] so people from Ireland they really need
[1:48:49] that
[1:48:51] I'm thinking how does he do it
[1:48:53] it's not possible
[1:48:58] some of us are Grudge holders
[1:49:01] and God really had to work on me to stop
[1:49:03] holding grudges
[1:49:05] that you gotta learn to let go of the
[1:49:08] thing because as long as you're holding
[1:49:10] a grudge it keeps you in prison and
[1:49:12] captive
[1:49:14] and so I had to learn by holding grudges
[1:49:17] and how it made me feel that I had to
[1:49:20] let go of it
[1:49:24] you don't understand Brothers thinking
[1:49:25] sure I do
[1:49:27] all of us understand
[1:49:28] because we all deal with it
[1:49:36] so it's important for us there's gold
[1:49:38] there's this this this mind that we have
[1:49:41] is so important for us to protect it
[1:49:44] and to be careful what we LED because
[1:49:47] the mind is the womb to the
[1:49:51] God help us okay let's move on
[1:49:55] secondly is the breast and arms of
[1:49:58] silver
[1:49:59] to me when I think about it I think of
[1:50:02] money and I think of wealth
[1:50:05] and I think of bright and shiny things
[1:50:10] back then they used silver for money
[1:50:14] he's got two arms
[1:50:16] how many of us welcome money with two
[1:50:20] arms
[1:50:23] I love it so much that I want two arms
[1:50:26] and I'm gonna hold it real tight to my
[1:50:27] chest silver
[1:50:29] the Love of Money
[1:50:32] the love of money is the what it is the
[1:50:35] root of all evil why is it the root
[1:50:39] cause of all evil just ask our president
[1:50:44] and his son
[1:50:46] they'll tell you
[1:50:49] because they'll do evil things
[1:50:52] for the love
[1:50:55] nobody ties their hand behind their back
[1:50:57] when someone offers them money
[1:51:00] put whatever you can in my pocket no
[1:51:03] give it to me I want as much of this
[1:51:05] that I can hold why because it's
[1:51:08] precious to me
[1:51:09] notice it wasn't only the arms but it
[1:51:12] was the chest area
[1:51:14] too many Believers are holding money so
[1:51:17] close to their chest
[1:51:19] that is the most important thing to them
[1:51:22] in their lives
[1:51:25] now there's some of you that have the
[1:51:28] character enough to to take care of that
[1:51:30] thing and I said God bless you
[1:51:32] not talking about everybody
[1:51:35] I'm just talking about those who have
[1:51:36] hundred dollar character
[1:51:39] you give them an arm full of money guess
[1:51:40] what happens they blow it all their
[1:51:44] character really shows through
[1:51:47] shiny things
[1:51:48] what's shiny materialistic
[1:51:54] I just won
[1:51:56] I just want the bigger house
[1:51:58] if I can make this amount of money I'd
[1:52:00] be happy
[1:52:02] you get to that point you're not happy
[1:52:04] if I could just have a bigger car if I
[1:52:06] could just have this if I could just
[1:52:07] have that oh I'd be so happy and you
[1:52:10] realize when you get there you're not
[1:52:11] happy
[1:52:13] everybody remember amnam's friend when I
[1:52:16] preached on it
[1:52:17] when I am them got what he wanted
[1:52:22] his hatred for his sister was greater
[1:52:25] than the love that he had for her
[1:52:30] he wanted it he wanted it so bad
[1:52:33] and when he got the shiny materialistic
[1:52:35] things he realized and he said oh I hate
[1:52:38] it I don't want this this is not what I
[1:52:41] wanted but they think that they want
[1:52:42] more if I could just get more I'd be
[1:52:45] happy if I could just have something
[1:52:46] shinier I'd be happy
[1:52:49] if I could just have something greater
[1:52:51] and something better and I'll work for
[1:52:53] it I'll be so happy but when you get
[1:52:54] there you realize this is not making me
[1:52:57] happy there's one thing in a believer's
[1:53:00] life that'll make you happy and
[1:53:02] satisfied and that's a closer walk with
[1:53:04] God and that's more Revelation with God
[1:53:07] though that is the thing that we should
[1:53:09] be chasing after that is the thing that
[1:53:11] we should be spending our time after as
[1:53:14] a closer walk with God
[1:53:21] where'd it go
[1:53:23] it's gone
[1:53:25] you know God
[1:53:27] can do with you what he did to these
[1:53:29] Empires
[1:53:32] Take It All Away
[1:53:34] he'll take you through the school of
[1:53:36] humility
[1:53:38] [Laughter]
[1:53:41] oh it's not a good it's not a good
[1:53:44] school to go through
[1:53:46] but let me tell you every son and
[1:53:48] daughter of God has to go through it
[1:53:50] do you know why because we're made in
[1:53:52] the image of this guy
[1:53:56] proud arrogant full of gold and precious
[1:54:00] metals
[1:54:04] God will take you through a school
[1:54:08] you know wipe your feet from below you
[1:54:11] take all this stuff away
[1:54:13] and that'll humble you
[1:54:17] he won't humiliate you
[1:54:22] God's business and his school is not a
[1:54:24] school of humiliation
[1:54:26] Satan wants to humiliate you before
[1:54:29] everybody but God wants to Humble you
[1:54:32] through humility through his school of
[1:54:35] Trials and testings
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:40] so thirdly we find
[1:54:43] uh you know the more I read this the
[1:54:45] more I realize this I do believe that
[1:54:48] this statue that Nebuchadnezzar was
[1:54:51] Irish
[1:54:53] huh
[1:54:55] maybe these are the things I deal with I
[1:54:57] don't know
[1:55:00] this is a good one
[1:55:02] thirdly is the belly of brass
[1:55:06] the King was Alexander the Great who was
[1:55:09] a great man of military might
[1:55:12] Alexander the Great was a great
[1:55:14] conqueror he was a great military man
[1:55:17] who took over the kingdom of Greece from
[1:55:20] his father Philip when he was 20 years
[1:55:22] old
[1:55:24] and he went on a rampage
[1:55:27] going through the Empire of Persia
[1:55:32] defeating Army after Army after Army for
[1:55:36] 12 years he fought and he battled
[1:55:39] throughout the Empire of Persia and he
[1:55:42] took it over
[1:55:44] so what is this brass resemble for us in
[1:55:49] this day
[1:55:50] brass you can think of brass I think of
[1:55:52] bullets
[1:55:53] I think of War
[1:55:55] I think of fighting
[1:55:57] I think of bickering
[1:56:00] I think of a person that's full of brass
[1:56:03] that they do nothing they just want to
[1:56:06] fight all the time
[1:56:09] they just want to bicker with their
[1:56:11] loved ones
[1:56:12] they're not happy unless there's some
[1:56:14] kind of argument going on in the house
[1:56:17] they're not happy unless they're at
[1:56:19] fisty cuffs with somebody they're not
[1:56:21] happy unless they're at odds with
[1:56:23] somebody else in the church what's wrong
[1:56:25] with this picture they got too much
[1:56:27] brass in their lives
[1:56:32] you know it's a prideful thing
[1:56:34] to always want to be right
[1:56:36] you really that's what arguments are all
[1:56:38] about
[1:56:40] it's two people
[1:56:42] arguing because one thinks they're right
[1:56:45] and the other one thinks they're right
[1:56:46] and no none of them will back down
[1:56:52] oh make me less of a man if I back down
[1:56:55] I'm a fighter let me tell you something
[1:56:57] I'm from Ireland
[1:57:00] do you know my family history
[1:57:05] a bunch of carnality
[1:57:10] that's why we got a bunch of carnality
[1:57:12] amongst our families is because
[1:57:14] not one either one will humble
[1:57:17] themselves and say
[1:57:20] what'd you say
[1:57:24] what I said I'm sorry
[1:57:28] I was wrong
[1:57:32] the issue is pride
[1:57:35] so what God has to do with us
[1:57:38] and our families
[1:57:40] is that God has to take us through the
[1:57:42] school of humility
[1:57:46] and he has to let you be wrong
[1:57:49] for you to realize that you were wrong
[1:57:51] so that you would come back and say I'm
[1:57:55] sorry
[1:57:57] because the Bible says let not the sun
[1:58:00] go down on your
[1:58:02] wrath in other words make it right
[1:58:06] make it right before you go to bed make
[1:58:09] it right before you go to sleep when you
[1:58:11] wake up in the morning everything should
[1:58:14] be okay
[1:58:16] might take a couple of days for some of
[1:58:18] you
[1:58:26] the issue is brass in your life
[1:58:30] some of us need to get rid of the brass
[1:58:32] in our lives
[1:58:34] we're going to find out that this whole
[1:58:36] statue we read it earlier this whole
[1:58:38] statue gets smoked by something
[1:58:40] remember the statute resembles your
[1:58:43] carnal man
[1:58:45] but there's something that comes along
[1:58:46] and Strikes this guy
[1:58:50] Hallelujah
[1:58:53] fourthly is the legs and feet of iron
[1:58:56] with also the feet of clay this is the
[1:58:58] Roman Empire the worst and harshest of
[1:59:00] all these kingdoms now when I think of
[1:59:03] iron I immediately think of the sentence
[1:59:07] ruling with the rod of iron
[1:59:10] I think of rulership I think of
[1:59:13] dictatorship I think of somebody that's
[1:59:16] pretty forceful
[1:59:18] I think of somebody that says it's it's
[1:59:20] my way or it's the highway
[1:59:23] I think of a minister who beats the
[1:59:26] people
[1:59:27] I think of a minister who says if you
[1:59:29] leave my church it's over for you you're
[1:59:32] gone you get out of you get out of my
[1:59:34] church uh you're out of the will of God
[1:59:36] let me tell you that's wrong
[1:59:41] you ever see that video of that preacher
[1:59:44] and and he's he's just calling people
[1:59:48] out all over the place and he goes up to
[1:59:51] this guy he says you yeah you you stand
[1:59:53] up stand up yeah you you shouldn't have
[1:59:56] married her and your life is a wrecking
[1:59:58] and all that he's saying this before all
[1:59:59] the people
[2:00:00] and this is a big guy he goes and this
[2:00:03] this past he's like yeah give me a hug
[2:00:07] you know I love you
[2:00:10] love is corrective
[2:00:12] but only when it's brought with the
[2:00:13] right intent and motive
[2:00:17] a man who is ruling either in his
[2:00:19] household or amongst the church where
[2:00:21] the rod of iron has the wrong motive and
[2:00:23] the wrong intent for the people
[2:00:26] because he doesn't want what's best for
[2:00:29] them
[2:00:32] you'll do what I say whether you like it
[2:00:34] or not
[2:00:37] you better get away from a preacher like
[2:00:38] that
[2:00:40] you better get away from a pastor like
[2:00:42] that let me tell you
[2:00:44] if me or brother Ron ever get like that
[2:00:46] he better make like a tree and leave
[2:00:50] that be in your best interests
[2:00:53] why because that's what the Catholic
[2:00:55] Church did the Catholic Church they
[2:00:57] ruled with the rod of iron they put fear
[2:01:01] in the people to make the people come
[2:01:04] into line through fear
[2:01:08] I thought love and fear couldn't exist
[2:01:10] at the same time
[2:01:13] because where love is it casts out what
[2:01:16] all fear not just fear all fear
[2:01:20] so what they did was they brought the
[2:01:22] people through fear and trembling and
[2:01:25] you better do what you're told are else
[2:01:29] I don't believe that that's a way that
[2:01:31] we should raise our family
[2:01:34] because if you raise a family through
[2:01:37] fear
[2:01:38] that's how they look to God
[2:01:41] and they think well God is like that and
[2:01:44] every single mistake that I make oh
[2:01:46] I'm going to be ruled with the rod of
[2:01:48] iron
[2:01:51] our heavenly father isn't like that
[2:01:55] our heavenly father is a corrective
[2:01:57] father
[2:01:58] but as a correct through love
[2:02:01] it is a correctiveness through the love
[2:02:03] of God
[2:02:05] help us
[2:02:07] to love one another through good motives
[2:02:10] good intentions through love and
[2:02:13] corrective not with a rod of iron
[2:02:23] an exposition of the seven Church ages
[2:02:25] brother Branham said this Roman Empire
[2:02:27] of iron iron signifying power and great
[2:02:30] destructive force against opposition
[2:02:33] nothing stood in their way
[2:02:37] was to be made of two main divisions and
[2:02:39] it certainly was for the Empire
[2:02:40] literally split into two east and west
[2:02:44] both were very powerful crushing all
[2:02:46] before them but as the glory and power
[2:02:48] of all Empires fall so this Empire began
[2:02:52] to fall also
[2:02:54] thus Rome fell Pagan Imperial Rome was
[2:02:57] no longer iron she crumbled she was
[2:03:00] wounded to death Rome could not now rule
[2:03:03] it was all over so thought the world
[2:03:08] but how wrong the world was for that
[2:03:10] head Rome though wounded was not wounded
[2:03:13] unto death
[2:03:14] Revelations 13 13
[2:03:17] says and one of the heads of his heads
[2:03:21] appeared to have been mortally wounded
[2:03:23] the throat haven't been slashed and his
[2:03:26] Deathstroke was healed and the people
[2:03:30] uh
[2:03:32] where am I here
[2:03:34] and the people of
[2:03:36] the whole earth I totally just got lost
[2:03:41] and the whole earth followed after the
[2:03:44] wild beast in amazement wow
[2:03:48] talk about humility
[2:03:51] I guess I needed to be humbled here for
[2:03:53] a second
[2:03:56] is it time for church
[2:03:58] where are we at
[2:04:02] people look at Rome they look at the
[2:04:05] Nash the nation of Italy and as they
[2:04:07] look they do not realize that wrong with
[2:04:09] their strict confines where the pope has
[2:04:12] an actual area as his domain is
[2:04:14] literally a nation within a nation and
[2:04:17] she has ambassadors and receives
[2:04:18] ambassadors papal false Christian Rome
[2:04:22] she is even called The Eternal City how
[2:04:25] Blasphemous Now controls by religion
[2:04:28] even more ably than when Pagan Imperial
[2:04:31] Rome controlled by the pure iron of
[2:04:34] force Rome took on a new lease of life
[2:04:36] when Constantine joined church and state
[2:04:39] and backed the Union by force the spirit
[2:04:41] that motivated Pagan Rome is the Same
[2:04:43] Spirit
[2:04:45] that now motivates false Christian Rome
[2:04:48] you can see that is so because you now
[2:04:53] know that the fourth Empire never went
[2:04:55] out of existence it just changed in its
[2:04:58] outer texture
[2:05:01] so we find out that Pagan Rome
[2:05:05] she fell like all the other nations and
[2:05:08] Empires that went before her but she
[2:05:11] wasn't done yet because through
[2:05:13] Constantine now marrying church and
[2:05:16] state together it brought a union
[2:05:20] and through this union now it revived
[2:05:24] the life that was within this Roman
[2:05:27] Empire and so brother Brown and we know
[2:05:29] that through the Dark Ages there was 68
[2:05:32] million Martyrs that were killed notice
[2:05:36] why they were killed in the name of
[2:05:39] religion
[2:05:43] unless you bow down look at the rod of
[2:05:46] iron now unless you bow down unless you
[2:05:49] uh worship how we worship unless you
[2:05:52] recant and you say that the pope is the
[2:05:54] Vicar of Christ and all these different
[2:05:56] things you will be put to death you'll
[2:06:00] do as you're told whether you like it or
[2:06:01] not
[2:06:04] and what happened now is she's been
[2:06:06] ruling the world
[2:06:07] since
[2:06:08] this Roman Empire began at the time of
[2:06:12] Jesus
[2:06:13] because remember Jerusalem and the Jews
[2:06:15] they were always looking for the Messiah
[2:06:17] to come and to rescue them from the
[2:06:19] Romans
[2:06:21] but that one fell but now that same
[2:06:24] spirit is still ruling the people until
[2:06:26] the second coming of Christ
[2:06:29] ruling with fear
[2:06:38] we don't serve God
[2:06:40] because of fear
[2:06:43] we should never preach a fearful message
[2:06:47] because that's not what brother Branham
[2:06:49] preached
[2:06:50] we preach love
[2:06:52] because when you fall in love with
[2:06:54] Christ guess what everything else just
[2:06:55] Falls in line
[2:07:01] so now we realize that Satan has had six
[2:07:05] thousand years to perfect
[2:07:07] this image that we've been looking at
[2:07:09] this morning
[2:07:10] and one thing that he has perfected very
[2:07:13] well is
[2:07:15] within our humanity is our human
[2:07:19] abilities
[2:07:23] each of you have a human ability that
[2:07:26] you were born with
[2:07:27] something that you're very natural at
[2:07:30] something that you are very good at now
[2:07:32] what happens is we begin to depend too
[2:07:36] much Upon Our human abilities rather
[2:07:39] than the word of God
[2:07:42] and so that's what Satan has done
[2:07:44] through six thousand years now which
[2:07:47] started in the head is ends up in the
[2:07:49] feet he has started this perfecting this
[2:07:53] image
[2:07:54] of a carnal man
[2:07:56] a carnal man that'll survive anything
[2:08:00] that's thrown at him
[2:08:01] I can survive anything you throw
[2:08:03] anything at me all over come and I'll
[2:08:05] get on with it
[2:08:07] I don't need nothing I don't need
[2:08:09] nobody's help
[2:08:11] yeah that's the thought of Satan
[2:08:14] because within ourselves our ability is
[2:08:18] zero when it comes to the eyes of God
[2:08:21] people have said that Christians are
[2:08:24] weak people and it's true I humble
[2:08:27] myself this morning and I say I'm so
[2:08:29] weak that I can't even walk a single
[2:08:32] step that I need him to carry me on the
[2:08:36] footsteps of time
[2:08:40] so we find now that Satan has had this
[2:08:43] uh six thousand years
[2:08:46] to perfect this carnal man
[2:08:50] he has us relying on our finances he has
[2:08:53] us relying Upon Our abilities as a as a
[2:08:57] human being he has us relying on all of
[2:09:00] our natural elements with that this uh
[2:09:03] human man can can bring forth I guess
[2:09:07] would be a good way to put on it but yet
[2:09:09] in the eyes of God that doesn't mean
[2:09:12] nothing
[2:09:13] God doesn't want your abilities
[2:09:17] but God wants your heart
[2:09:25] we are now back to the time of Babel and
[2:09:29] of nimrod
[2:09:30] where the very desires of their hearts
[2:09:33] they were able to accomplish
[2:09:36] whatever they wanted to build they were
[2:09:38] able to build it whatever they wanted to
[2:09:40] do they were able to do they were all of
[2:09:42] one language and they were all of One
[2:09:44] Accord and there was nothing that they
[2:09:46] were not able to do or conquer
[2:09:49] that's where we are today in laodiacia
[2:09:52] look at the science
[2:09:55] look at the wonderful things that
[2:09:57] science is able to do and some of these
[2:10:00] things will praise the Lord I tell you
[2:10:02] what I'm thankful for the things that we
[2:10:04] can do in science because some of our
[2:10:06] kids would not be alive if it wasn't for
[2:10:09] scientific research and what they can do
[2:10:14] but now if we're depending upon the
[2:10:16] science
[2:10:17] and effort depending upon the abilities
[2:10:20] of humanity it takes our dependence off
[2:10:23] of God
[2:10:24] and that's what Satan
[2:10:28] as the musicians come this morning
[2:10:31] we'll bring this to a close
[2:10:35] we realize that
[2:10:38] that's not the end of this statue
[2:10:42] it's not the end of the dream
[2:10:46] but there was a stone
[2:10:48] the Bible said that this Stone was tuned
[2:10:51] out of a mountain
[2:10:52] not by hands
[2:10:55] it was the stone that the builders
[2:10:57] rejected
[2:10:59] that has now become the Chief
[2:11:01] Cornerstone
[2:11:02] Jesus Christ
[2:11:05] and so we find that when we read about
[2:11:09] this stone that it dashed this image
[2:11:12] into pieces
[2:11:13] that the pieces of this image went
[2:11:15] throughout
[2:11:16] all the Earth there was no Landing spots
[2:11:19] for it it was like the dust on a
[2:11:20] thrashing floor
[2:11:22] what is this showing to us that this
[2:11:25] rock this revelation of Jesus Christ of
[2:11:29] who he is in this day it needs to come
[2:11:32] into our lives and it needs to
[2:11:35] absolutely smash the image of our carnal
[2:11:39] man
[2:11:42] Satan has had six thousand years to
[2:11:44] perfect this guy
[2:11:46] six thousand years perfecting his human
[2:11:49] abilities six thousand years showing him
[2:11:52] what he needs to do and rely upon and so
[2:11:54] on and so forth but when it comes to God
[2:11:57] our natural abilities as a man counts as
[2:12:01] absolutely nothing it counts as so much
[2:12:05] that he strikes the image and that image
[2:12:08] is no more seen but there's an image now
[2:12:11] that erects it turns from a stone into a
[2:12:15] big old mountain
[2:12:17] what is that mountain that New Jerusalem
[2:12:20] the city of God what is God wanting to
[2:12:24] do with us he's wanting to crush us
[2:12:26] through the school of humility he's
[2:12:29] wanting to crush us of our carnal man
[2:12:32] he's wanting to crush us of the things
[2:12:34] that we rely on in order for Christ now
[2:12:38] that rock that Revelation to make itself
[2:12:42] manifested
[2:12:44] into a mountain that the old Earth can
[2:12:46] look to and see
[2:12:53] but it only comes
[2:12:55] through a school
[2:12:58] we often say I want to be like Jesus
[2:13:02] oh to be like Jesus all I want to be is
[2:13:05] just like him
[2:13:08] Jesus though he was found in the fashion
[2:13:12] of a man going back to my original
[2:13:14] scripture
[2:13:14] [Music]
[2:13:16] yet he humbled himself
[2:13:21] you want to be like Jesus
[2:13:24] you gotta humble yourself
[2:13:26] [Music]
[2:13:28] you want to be like Jesus you need to
[2:13:30] humble yourself of the brass in your
[2:13:31] life
[2:13:33] you gotta humble yourself of always
[2:13:35] wanting to be right in every situation
[2:13:39] you want to be like Jesus
[2:13:41] you got to go through the school of
[2:13:43] humility
[2:13:45] because Jesus learned obedience through
[2:13:48] what
[2:13:50] the things that he suffered
[2:13:53] he learned obedience to the word
[2:13:56] by going through this school
[2:13:58] of humility
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:03] you want to say School of Hard Knocks
[2:14:06] people take Hard Knocks but yet they're
[2:14:09] never humble after it
[2:14:13] we man brother Michael were
[2:14:15] fellowshipping in the back office
[2:14:18] and we're talking about these things I
[2:14:20] said did you read my notes of what I'm
[2:14:22] wanting to get into
[2:14:24] he said no
[2:14:27] but he's in the channel
[2:14:28] [Music]
[2:14:31] this is different than the School of
[2:14:33] Hard Knocks
[2:14:34] because people that go through a School
[2:14:36] of Hard Knocks they become hard
[2:14:43] their heart is not tender
[2:14:45] their spirit is not soft
[2:14:49] in Ireland we say
[2:14:50] that person had a hard paper around when
[2:14:53] they were younger
[2:14:54] why because they've been through the
[2:14:56] School of Hard Knocks and through the
[2:14:58] knocks of life and through the knocks of
[2:15:00] school of this school guess what happens
[2:15:03] it's written all over them
[2:15:07] God's School of humility
[2:15:09] this is what I want to get into
[2:15:12] it is not to humiliate you
[2:15:16] it is not to make you hard in spirit or
[2:15:18] heart
[2:15:21] but as to make you humble
[2:15:24] because brother Branham said that God
[2:15:26] dwells
[2:15:28] in humility
[2:15:32] you say well brother Stephen I don't
[2:15:34] want to go through that school I don't
[2:15:36] think I need to
[2:15:39] get rid of some of that Pride
[2:15:41] [Music]
[2:15:43] what are the people going to think in
[2:15:45] church when they see me going through
[2:15:47] this school
[2:15:49] lay down your pride
[2:15:52] who cares what other people think
[2:15:55] when God is doing a work in your life it
[2:15:57] doesn't matter what anybody else says
[2:16:00] so this school that every born-again
[2:16:04] believer must go through
[2:16:06] why must I go through it because my
[2:16:09] carnal man has been perfected over 6 000
[2:16:13] years
[2:16:15] and God doesn't want me to be a carnal
[2:16:18] man anymore
[2:16:19] but he wants to crush the image so that
[2:16:23] the image of Christ might be made known
[2:16:25] to everyone around us God bless you this
[2:16:29] morning
[2:16:30] I appreciate your patience
[2:16:34] we went a little slow
[2:16:36] and that's okay
[2:16:37] [Music]
[2:16:38] I failed to go slow this morning
[2:16:41] so much of the time
[2:16:43] we can get caught up with
[2:16:46] preaching and you got to preach it and
[2:16:47] you got to preach it well when you
[2:16:49] preach it
[2:16:50] those who perhaps are younger ones or
[2:16:53] those that are new amongst us they're
[2:16:56] not quite catching what is being said
[2:16:59] but when you slow down a little bit and
[2:17:02] you explain yourself a little bit better
[2:17:05] I feel it's easier to catch
[2:17:09] and if I'm being quite honest
[2:17:12] it's because of my own inabilities to
[2:17:15] teach
[2:17:19] slower the better
[2:17:22] going to church saints of God is not a
[2:17:25] race
[2:17:26] like the hair and the Tortoise
[2:17:30] it's not a race
[2:17:32] it doesn't matter who finished his first
[2:17:33] it doesn't matter that's what the hair
[2:17:35] thought
[2:17:37] it doesn't matter if you catch things a
[2:17:39] little slowly it doesn't matter if we're
[2:17:41] not jumping and hooting and hollering
[2:17:42] it's okay listen to the word that's
[2:17:46] being preached
[2:17:47] because it's the word that has an effect
[2:17:49] in our lives not the emotion
[2:17:54] so now
[2:17:55] I want you all to go home this evening
[2:17:57] today
[2:17:59] I want you to read Daniel chapter 2. and
[2:18:02] I want you to remind yourself of these
[2:18:05] different symbols of what we talked
[2:18:07] about this morning perhaps when you read
[2:18:09] it you'll see something a little
[2:18:11] different of what gold means you'll see
[2:18:13] something a little different of what
[2:18:15] silver means you'll see something a
[2:18:17] little different and let the Holy Spirit
[2:18:19] now
[2:18:20] deal with your heart
[2:18:22] and say this is the silver the brass the
[2:18:26] clay this is the iron that's in my life
[2:18:29] that I need to take care of
[2:18:32] this is what I need to take care of in
[2:18:35] my life and watch the Holy Spirit now
[2:18:37] take care of that thing
[2:18:40] that's powerheads
[2:18:42] Heavenly Father we certainly thank you
[2:18:45] Lord for this opportunity to be in your
[2:18:48] house and your word Lord is a a lamp
[2:18:51] unto our feet and I thank you that

[2:18:57] is showing us the correct ways in which
[2:19:00] we may walk our Earthly Journey Lord I
[2:19:04] ask a special blessing upon your people
[2:19:06] father that you would reveal and unfold
[2:19:10] and father God May there be such a time
[2:19:13] of as Abraham lifted up his eyes in
[2:19:16] Revelation Lord may we have a week of of
[2:19:20] Revelation in our own private homes
[2:19:23] father God because we are the church
[2:19:27] Lord the church is not just a building
[2:19:29] but if we are the church everywhere we
[2:19:32] go we're in church Lord so may when we
[2:19:36] are in church in our homes or in our
[2:19:38] cars I pray that you would speak to our
[2:19:40] hearts and reveal to us Lord the things
[2:19:43] that we need to take care of
