[46:24] was in the room the other day there in
[46:27] the conference room and I was counseling
[46:29] with a couple and I had mentioned some
[46:32] things that I had questioned throughout
[46:34] the scriptures and I thought you know
[46:36] I've always wanted to to preach on this
[46:39] and just like I'd always wanted to
[46:40] preach on the thief on the cross well
[46:43] today I'm going to have another
[46:45] Milestone where I'm going to preach on
[46:46] one of the things I've thought about um
[46:49] much of my Christian Life and uh so I'm
[46:53] going to be preaching on Solomon Solomon
[46:58] and so anyway if you just remain
[47:00] standing and let's turn to our
[47:07] Bibles how does our Pulpit
[47:11] look H does it look good is it fit me
[47:14] okay just
[47:17] right thank you it's I think it's a
[47:23] masterpiece First Kings chapter 3
[47:27] we're going to be doing a lot of reading
[47:34] here first
[47:37] Kings chapter 3 and we'll go through 1-
[47:43] 15 and Solomon made Affinity with
[47:46] Pharaoh king of
[47:48] Egypt and took Pharaoh's daughter and
[47:50] brought her into the city of David until
[47:52] he had made an end of building his own
[47:55] house and the house of the Lord than the
[47:57] wall of Jerusalem round
[47:59] about only the people sacrificed in high
[48:03] places because there was no house built
[48:07] unto the name of the Lord until those
[48:09] days and Solomon loved the Lord walking
[48:13] in the statutes of David his
[48:16] father only he sacrificed and burnt
[48:20] incense in high
[48:23] places may God add the blessing to his
[48:25] word you may be seeded because we're
[48:28] reading quite a bit I want you to just
[48:30] follow along with me now notice the
[48:34] first verse
[48:37] there Solomon had an
[48:40] affinity with
[48:42] Pharaoh we're going to be looking at
[48:44] this this is showing even at the very
[48:50] beginning of his reign as king there's a
[48:54] margin of eror
[48:58] and it's going to
[49:00] start and it's going to continue until
[49:02] it
[49:06] consumes and this is one
[49:09] of the questions that I have had as a
[49:12] young
[49:13] man how is it that the wisest of all men
[49:19] will make the most foolish
[49:23] ofs think about this thought now as we
[49:26] continue reading
[49:29] reading and the King went to gibian to
[49:32] sacrifice
[49:34] there for that was the great high place
[49:37] and a thousand burnt offerings did
[49:38] Solomon offer upon the
[49:41] altar in gibian the Lord appeared to
[49:44] Solomon in a Dream by night so now God's
[49:47] going to be dealing with Solomon and
[49:48] he's going to appear to him twice this
[49:51] is the first time in gibian and God said
[49:55] ask what I shall give thee and Solomon
[49:59] said thou Hast shown showed unto thy
[50:04] servant David my father great Mercy
[50:07] according as he walked before thee in
[50:09] truth and in righteousness and in
[50:11] uprightness of heart with
[50:13] thee and thou Hast kept
[50:17] him this great for him this great
[50:21] kindness that thou Hast given him a son
[50:24] to sit on his throne as it is in this
[50:27] day and now oh Lord my God thou Hast
[50:31] made thy servant King instead of David
[50:34] my father and I am but a little child I
[50:38] know not how to go out or come
[50:41] in and thy servant is in the midst of
[50:44] thy people which thou Hast chosen a
[50:47] great people that cannot be numbered nor
[50:50] counted for
[50:52] multitude give therefore thy servant an
[50:55] understanding heart to judge thy people
[50:58] that I may discern between good and bad
[51:01] for who is able to
[51:03] judge this so great a people and the
[51:07] speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had
[51:10] asked this thing and God said unto him
[51:13] because thou H has asked this thing and
[51:16] H has not asked for thy self long life
[51:20] neither hast thou asked for riches
[51:22] thyself nor has asked the life of thine
[51:25] enemies but has asked for thyself
[51:29] understanding to discern
[51:30] judgment behold I have done according to
[51:33] thy words lo I have given thee a wise
[51:38] and understanding heart so that there
[51:41] was none like thee before thee and
[51:44] neither after thee shall any wise any
[51:48] arise like unto
[51:50] thee I have also given thee that which
[51:53] thou Hast not asked both riches
[51:57] and honor so there shall not be any
[52:01] among the Kings like unto thee all thy
[52:05] days here's the
[52:08] catch and if thou W walk in my ways to
[52:13] keep my statutes and my Commandments as
[52:16] thy father David did walk then I will
[52:19] lengthen thy days and Solomon awoke and
[52:24] behold it was a
[52:25] dream and he came to Jerusalem and stood
[52:29] before the Ark of the Covenant of the
[52:30] Lord and offered up burnt offerings and
[52:33] offered peace offerings and made a feast
[52:36] to all his
[52:39] servants now turn with me back to First
[52:42] Kings 10 First Kings chapter
[52:49] 10 verses 23-
[52:54] 29 but if you remember much of the time
[52:57] there is a reference of the wisdom of
[53:00] Solomon and of a woman named uh the
[53:03] Queen of
[53:04] Sheba how that she comes to him and you
[53:08] see that in the first part of the
[53:10] chapter I'm not reading those scriptures
[53:11] but you can see it in in first King
[53:14] Kings 10 verse1 but we're going to drop
[53:17] down now to verse
[53:20] 23 so King Solomon exceeded all the
[53:24] kings of the Earth for riches and for
[53:28] wisdom and all the Earth sought to
[53:32] sought to Solomon to hear his wisdom
[53:35] which God had put in his
[53:37] heart and they brought every man his
[53:40] present vessels of silver and vessels of
[53:44] gold and garments and armor and spices
[53:47] and horses and mules aate year by
[53:51] year and Solomon gathered together
[53:54] chariots and Horsemen and he had
[53:58] 1,400 chariots 12,000 Horsemen to whom
[54:03] bestowed in the cities for chariots and
[54:06] with the king at
[54:08] Jerusalem and the King made silver to be
[54:13] in Jerusalem as stones and Cedars made
[54:15] to be as sycamore trees that are in the
[54:18] veil for abundance and Solomon had
[54:20] horses brought out of Egypt and linen
[54:24] yarn the king's Merchants received
[54:26] received the linen yarn at a price and a
[54:29] chariot came up and went out of Egypt
[54:31] for 600 shekels of silver and a horse
[54:34] for
[54:35] 150 for and for all the kings of the
[54:38] Hittites and the kings of Syria did they
[54:41] bring them out by their means may God
[54:45] add the blessing to the reading of his
[54:47] word this morning and I pray that God
[54:50] will help me to deliver this thought
[54:54] that I've had on my heart and wed for
[54:57] some time because when you have a
[55:00] question within the scripture there is a
[55:03] Bible
[55:06] answer and so I'm titling my
[55:09] sermon how can the wisest of all men
[55:13] make the most foolish of
[55:18] ears how does he make this
[55:23] mistake and so I'm taking as a subject
[55:26] this
[55:28] morning having an affinity with
[55:33] pharaoh and
[55:37] so when you look at
[55:39] this he's got an affinity with
[55:43] Pharaoh takes his daughter I looked up
[55:46] the word
[55:49] Affinity I don't know if I sent
[55:51] it to the brother yes Hebrew cam
[55:57] to give a daughter away in marriage
[55:59] hence generally to make a contract
[56:01] Affinity by
[56:04] marriage now the Bible does not tell us
[56:07] that Pharaoh's daughter is a
[56:10] convert doesn't say she is a proelite
[56:16] right and I want you to know that it was
[56:18] forbidden for Israelites to marry
[56:21] Heathen
[56:23] women I want to ask you the question
[56:27] how can the wisest of men with wisdom of
[56:29] God make such a foolish
[56:33] air and it's hidden within the
[56:36] scriptures and this pattern repeats
[56:39] itself all through the
[56:42] scriptures so you take this thought this
[56:45] Affinity he's got this contract there
[56:48] and why was this Affinity with
[56:51] Pharaoh why would you have this and we
[56:54] see that there were reasons behind his
[56:58] desire to have this
[57:01] woman and most of it was all political
[57:05] in fact it is a historical fact among
[57:08] the Jews that Solomon never married a
[57:13] woman from
[57:15] Israel of over
[57:19] 700 of his wives and 300 concubine
[57:22] thousand women not one was from Israel
[57:36] this is a little hard to
[57:39] Fathom I thought you said he's a
[57:42] smartest guy in the
[57:48] world
[57:51] yeah but see he had this Affinity with
[57:54] pharaoh
[57:56] he had this
[58:01] connection he had noticed the lifestyle
[58:04] they kind of lean this direction and the
[58:06] Bible says the way a tree leans so shall
[58:11] it fall so we see already at the very
[58:13] beginning of the reign of
[58:16] Solomon who I want to take you back is
[58:19] one of the four sons of David through
[58:22] basba the first one you know died
[58:27] and we know that two other sons of David
[58:31] also who thought they would be air to
[58:34] the throne both of them sought the
[58:36] throne
[58:39] illegally and one of uh Solomon's
[58:43] Brothers son of David came to basheba
[58:47] and said would you please give me
[58:50] abishag to
[58:52] Mary that remember
[58:54] abishag uh was the the the female that
[58:57] was given to King David to keep him warm
[58:59] in his old age you remember
[59:03] that
[59:05] Solomon
[59:07] catches what is going on there's a plot
[59:09] going on behind it and when BBA asks
[59:14] this
[59:16] for Solomon's brother he said well why
[59:18] don't we give him the throne
[59:20] also and what does he do he kills his
[59:23] brother has him killed
[59:27] so I want you to
[59:29] understand that there is a element of a
[59:32] and yet he's an elect Son of God God's
[59:36] watching over him but even Great Men
[59:39] great men with great wisdom make foolish
[59:43] airs and yet I want to make this
[59:46] disclaimer to all of you right now
[59:48] Solomon will be
[59:50] there he's going to be in heaven but
[59:54] we're going to see through the
[59:56] scriptures that this little issue that
[59:59] he had at the beginning of his Reign
[1:00:02] actually consumes him in his old
[1:00:05] age have any of you read it in your
[1:00:07] Bible have you seen the heir of
[1:00:11] Solomon and yet the question is there in
[1:00:13] my mind hey wait a second with all of
[1:00:17] your getting get
[1:00:22] understanding so I wish to just rehearse
[1:00:25] this in your mind this
[1:00:29] morning and this Affinity that he has
[1:00:35] will actually come to a full
[1:00:37] manifestation in the latter years of his
[1:00:40] life understand that Solomon as a young
[1:00:43] man loves the Lord it says he loves the
[1:00:46] Lord and in his youth he's doing an
[1:00:49] awful and how long does the uh reign of
[1:00:53] Solomon lasts 40 years
[1:00:56] so the from the time of his Youth and he
[1:00:59] loves the Lord but there is a little
[1:01:02] issue that is there that is perhaps
[1:01:09] unnoticed it is overlooked by
[1:01:13] many and when you see that if you
[1:01:16] overlook keeping all of God's
[1:01:19] commandment it's going to come back to
[1:01:21] bite
[1:01:23] you amen
[1:01:26] man shall not live by bread alone but
[1:01:30] by somebody say it out loud every word
[1:01:34] of
[1:01:35] God therefore we can't change it one jot
[1:01:38] or one TT that's
[1:01:41] right and we look at the um this as that
[1:01:47] he wanted political favor in fact all of
[1:01:51] the 700 women that he
[1:01:53] marries are from the the Nations and
[1:01:58] countries and the
[1:02:00] reigning um Pagan Heathen countries
[1:02:04] around there that's why there was 40
[1:02:06] Years of no war it was almost a fake
[1:02:12] Millennium 40 years well why I'll marry
[1:02:15] your daughter you don't attack I'll
[1:02:17] marry your daughter don't
[1:02:21] attack okay so now he's politically
[1:02:24] minded
[1:02:26] he's got the all of these women and and
[1:02:28] and we're going to be looking at this
[1:02:30] and dissecting it down and Solon was one
[1:02:34] of the greatest Kings of Israel there is
[1:02:36] no doubt he was h of the physical
[1:02:39] lineage of
[1:02:43] David now Solomon loved the
[1:02:46] Lord and yet he had an affinity towards
[1:02:53] pharaoh and so it's going to show in a
[1:02:56] weak
[1:02:57] spot a place let's call it his Achilles
[1:03:01] heel this is an
[1:03:04] issue that is never really truly dealt
[1:03:07] with and will be the
[1:03:11] demise of
[1:03:14] Solomon and the
[1:03:16] destruction of
[1:03:19] Israel and actually God says I'm going
[1:03:22] to Ren the Kingdom from you yes
[1:03:26] so how can this
[1:03:29] happen with all of this wisdom and
[1:03:32] understanding how could he missed such
[1:03:34] an important
[1:03:37] detail and make such a terrible
[1:03:43] mistake let me just rehearse something
[1:03:48] to all of you and you young people
[1:03:50] listen to this God under no
[1:03:53] circumstances wants you to go and
[1:03:56] marry an
[1:04:01] unbeliever you understand that he said
[1:04:04] under no
[1:04:06] condition and yet it
[1:04:08] happens go out here and marry some nice
[1:04:12] looking girl cuz you fell for her beauty
[1:04:15] instead of her
[1:04:22] character God does not want us unequally
[1:04:28] yolked did you know that one of the
[1:04:31] signs of the end time is going to be the
[1:04:32] increase of the beauty of
[1:04:36] women somebody say
[1:04:43] Amen some of you sisters are horribly
[1:04:46] cursed with
[1:04:47] that you're too
[1:04:51] pretty you are and it's going to be an
[1:04:54] issue to you
[1:04:58] and remember the god of
[1:05:00] America is a
[1:05:05] woman well I'm just I'm going slow
[1:05:08] because I want you to
[1:05:09] understand I'm going screw it down
[1:05:12] clinch the nail in fact Steven McNeely
[1:05:15] said brother Ron you take your time and
[1:05:19] he said you finish all your notes I said
[1:05:21] thank you so is that okay brother Steve
[1:05:23] can I do it all right buddy
[1:05:27] God all right so I want to ask you what
[1:05:31] caused the end of the lovian
[1:05:34] destruction the Bible gives us an answer
[1:05:37] in Genesis 6: 1 and
[1:05:39] 2 and it came to pass when men began to
[1:05:43] multiply on the face of the Earth and
[1:05:45] daughters were born un them here comes
[1:05:47] women
[1:05:52] again can't live with them we can't live
[1:05:55] without them
[1:05:59] that the sons of God saw the daughters
[1:06:03] of men were
[1:06:07] fair and took unto them wives of all
[1:06:12] which they
[1:06:15] chose and God never did forgive
[1:06:20] them they chose Beauty over
[1:06:23] virtue I want to ask ask what was wrong
[1:06:26] with the women from
[1:06:28] Israel that the sons of God would look
[1:06:30] at the daughters of
[1:06:33] man why would you look outside this
[1:06:37] message for a a wife where are you going
[1:06:40] to find a virtuous
[1:06:42] woman on a dating
[1:06:47] website how about LA
[1:06:52] Fitness huh how about a sporting
[1:06:56] event maybe she's a cheerleader for
[1:06:58] Dallas
[1:07:00] Cowboys woo maybe we're going to H come
[1:07:03] on
[1:07:07] now and I'm on the case of our young men
[1:07:10] how dare you look outside this
[1:07:14] message then you wind up do you find
[1:07:19] some beautiful
[1:07:22] girl and you marry her and just if you
[1:07:26] years later the beauty starts to vanish
[1:07:28] and next thing you know she's not a
[1:07:29] mother to your kids and you wind up
[1:07:31] what's the problem next thing you know
[1:07:34] you got a mess on your
[1:07:36] hands because you went into it
[1:07:40] wrong
[1:07:43] amen you better marry somebody that
[1:07:46] believes like you and better has the
[1:07:47] Holy
[1:07:49] Ghost even doctrinally thinking the same
[1:07:53] as you lest
[1:07:56] amen your sons marry their daughters
[1:07:59] vice versa and they take you away
[1:08:03] amen I'm going to show you in
[1:08:10] scriptures look at the warning that God
[1:08:12] give Israel through the teaching of
[1:08:14] Moses remember David
[1:08:17] was was pure in all his heart David make
[1:08:20] mistakes but you know what when he makes
[1:08:22] mistake and gets rebuked of God he is a
[1:08:25] man after God's Own Heart and when he
[1:08:28] took bash Sheba and it was wrong guess
[1:08:31] what he's going to pay for
[1:08:35] it but he repents quickly why his heart
[1:08:38] was right before
[1:08:41] God so there's a difference between
[1:08:43] David and Solomon because we're going to
[1:08:46] find out that David's heart was pure
[1:08:48] before God but not
[1:08:51] Solomon Solomon gave God his head but
[1:08:55] not his heart gave that to his wives
[1:08:59] Samson gave his heart to Delilah and his
[1:09:03] power to
[1:09:06] God and yet Samson's going to be
[1:09:10] there oh the Bible is filled with
[1:09:16] Mysteries and with different things that
[1:09:18] make us Wonder oh how did they get
[1:09:21] there how could this be how could it
[1:09:24] happen
[1:09:26] how could the wisest of all men on the
[1:09:29] Earth make a most foolish
[1:09:34] mistake it is found in Exodus 34 if you
[1:09:37] wish to turn in your Bibles
[1:09:39] also the Bible says take heed to thyself
[1:09:43] in other words I'm giving you a warning
[1:09:45] take heed to thyself lest thou make a
[1:09:47] covenant with the in habitants of the
[1:09:50] land wherewith thou
[1:09:52] goest so remember there's an exodus out
[1:09:55] of Egypt and guess what they go into
[1:09:58] Canaan and in the land is filled with
[1:10:01] Hittites and jebusites and
[1:10:05] parasites right all kinds of big and
[1:10:09] powerful
[1:10:12] Nations lest it be for a snare in the
[1:10:15] midst of thee so take heed when you
[1:10:21] go but you shall destroy their all
[1:10:25] Alters break their images and cut down
[1:10:28] their
[1:10:31] Groves for Thou shalt worship no other
[1:10:34] God for the Lord whose name is jealous
[1:10:38] is a jealous God
[1:10:42] Amen lest thou make a covenant an
[1:10:46] affinity make some kind of contract with
[1:10:49] the inhabitants of the land of this land
[1:10:52] and they go whing after their gods look
[1:10:54] at Spirit ual
[1:10:56] adultery what does he call it they go a
[1:11:00] whing after these false
[1:11:04] gods and do
[1:11:07] sacrifice unto their
[1:11:09] gods and one call thee and thou shalt
[1:11:12] eat of his
[1:11:14] sacrifice did you know it's forbidden to
[1:11:16] eat sacri sacrifices offered to
[1:11:20] odol
[1:11:24] yeah and thou take of their daughters
[1:11:26] under thy
[1:11:28] sons and their daughters go whing after
[1:11:32] their gods and make their sons go horing
[1:11:34] after their
[1:11:36] gods Thou shalt make thee no molten
[1:11:42] Gods let me show you another example
[1:11:45] because we find it also in Deuteronomy
[1:11:47] chapter
[1:11:50] 7 verses 3-8 neither shalt thou make
[1:11:54] marriages with them thy daughter shalt
[1:11:57] not give unto thy son nor his daughters
[1:12:01] shalt thou take unto thy son amen for
[1:12:05] they will turn away thy son from
[1:12:07] following me amen amen oh it's okay they
[1:12:13] she's from a good
[1:12:15] church trinitarian father son Holy Ghost
[1:12:19] they're good
[1:12:21] people I've been to their Church man I
[1:12:24] tell you those people they they're
[1:12:27] lovely people is there anything
[1:12:30] wrong with the
[1:12:32] people in fact some of them probably a
[1:12:35] whole lot nicer than we
[1:12:40] are
[1:12:43] yeah for they'll turn away thy son from
[1:12:46] following me that they may serve other
[1:12:50] gods right so will the anger of the Lord
[1:12:53] be kindled against you and destroy the
[1:12:55] suddenly because remember listen serve
[1:12:58] me and I will watch over you all the
[1:13:00] days of your life but go a whoring and
[1:13:03] I'm going
[1:13:05] to come on now he's the same yesterday
[1:13:10] today and
[1:13:13] forever but they shall deal with them ye
[1:13:17] shall destroy their altars break down
[1:13:20] their images cut down their Groves burn
[1:13:23] their graven images with fire and not
[1:13:26] even look at their
[1:13:31] website that's a paraphrase version
[1:13:35] here for thou art look at predestination
[1:13:38] unto election but thou art a holy
[1:13:41] people unto the Lord thy God the Lord
[1:13:44] thy God hath chosen to be a special
[1:13:46] people unto himself above all the people
[1:13:48] that are upon the face of the Earth let
[1:13:51] me tell you people you are special to
[1:13:54] God amen amen the Lord God did not set
[1:13:58] his love upon you nor chose you because
[1:14:02] you were more in number than any people
[1:14:04] for you were the fewest of all people
[1:14:07] but because the Lord God loved
[1:14:10] you and because he would keep the oath
[1:14:13] what he had sworn unto their your
[1:14:15] fathers hath the Lord brought you out of
[1:14:17] a with a mighty hand redeemed you out of
[1:14:19] the house of bondman from the hand of
[1:14:21] pharaoh king of Egypt now here's
[1:14:23] something he he bought you
[1:14:26] out from the hand of pharaoh and here
[1:14:29] the wisest of men has an
[1:14:33] affinity go
[1:14:35] figure with
[1:14:42] Pharaoh now brother Brenham picks this
[1:14:45] up because it takes a spiritual man to
[1:14:47] begin to see air in its
[1:14:50] infancy yes you understand in its
[1:14:53] infancy
[1:14:55] prophet of God said watch this rock and
[1:15:00] roll this music today with Elvis
[1:15:05] Presley Elvis Presley is
[1:15:08] tame compared to the filth and the
[1:15:11] nonsense of
[1:15:16] today Ricky
[1:15:22] Nelson all of these guys and the
[1:15:26] Beatles he said brother brandham said
[1:15:29] they weren't even in God's
[1:15:36] thinking takes a spiritual man begins to
[1:15:38] see something in its infancy
[1:15:42] form
[1:15:44] Watchmen what of the night you're on the
[1:15:47] tower you can see
[1:15:49] above I see brother Bram said watch you
[1:15:53] watch over your children you watch where
[1:15:55] they go what they look at what they
[1:15:57] listen to cuz I'm telling you if they
[1:15:59] don't get the Holy Ghost he says this
[1:16:01] modern day rock and roll music it'll
[1:16:03] catch
[1:16:06] them
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:10] Watchman what of the
[1:16:15] night I want to show you here's brother
[1:16:17] Brenham now in 1955 I've never studied
[1:16:21] what brother Brenham says about Solomon
[1:16:24] now now the vast majority of quotes that
[1:16:26] you're going to find that he refers to
[1:16:29] Solomon you're going to find out that he
[1:16:31] talks about the wisdom of solom the
[1:16:33] Queen of Sheba you're going to find it
[1:16:35] about Jonah who is in the belly of the
[1:16:39] whale and remembers the
[1:16:42] prayer of Solomon that if thou will turn
[1:16:45] thy face toward the holy city you'll get
[1:16:49] delivered right from the lying vanities
[1:16:52] am the vast majority of those quotes are
[1:16:56] going to refer to those things the Queen
[1:16:59] of Sheba and how she come and
[1:17:02] everything and what I want to probably
[1:17:05] launch off into and I'm ahead of myself
[1:17:08] right
[1:17:09] now but brother Brenham preaches a
[1:17:11] sermon called there's a
[1:17:22] greater thank God for a greater than
[1:17:25] Solomon is
[1:17:30] here so brother Brenham says in
[1:17:33] separation from unbelief
[1:17:36] 1955 here in Phoenix do you know the
[1:17:39] wisest man in the Bible outside of
[1:17:44] Christ died an
[1:17:47] idolator because of a bunch of pretty
[1:17:53] women Solomon
[1:17:55] pull him away from God all right don't
[1:17:58] yoke yourself up
[1:18:03] unequally he had an affinity with
[1:18:06] pharaoh and he took his daughter
[1:18:09] unequally yolked the prophet of God said
[1:18:12] what started in its
[1:18:15] infancy ends in a Devastation and the
[1:18:19] rening of the Kingdom from
[1:18:23] Solomon why little Beth Bethlehem
[1:18:27] 1962 well now the same thing is
[1:18:31] paralleled here
[1:18:33] again David's natural seed was
[1:18:36] Solomon and it backslid just like the
[1:18:39] other did of Abraham did it
[1:18:42] backslid so did Solomon backslide he got
[1:18:46] too many
[1:18:47] women and the first thing you know they
[1:18:49] LED his heart away from God and the way
[1:18:51] he went and backslid died that way
[1:18:55] backslid Israel died in the same way
[1:19:00] backslid now let me say this before we
[1:19:02] go further I do believe he's going to
[1:19:05] make it in
[1:19:08] heaven I believe we will see
[1:19:19] Solomon but it's a paradox to
[1:19:22] me that the man with the greatest his
[1:19:24] wisdom would make such a terrible
[1:19:29] mistake now brother Brandon preaches a
[1:19:32] sermon called lean not to your own
[1:19:35] understanding how many know that the way
[1:19:38] of a man is right in his own
[1:19:40] eyes so would it not be true for even
[1:19:43] the wisest of all men he was right in
[1:19:46] his own
[1:19:48] eyes Okay so follow along with me lean
[1:19:51] not to your own
[1:19:53] understanding we have made denominations
[1:19:56] and schools and buildings and failed to
[1:19:59] do what Jesus told us to do was preach
[1:20:02] the
[1:20:03] gospel we've tried to educate the
[1:20:06] world he never said educate the world
[1:20:10] he's that's educated shall be
[1:20:14] saved you got to be born again filled
[1:20:17] with the Holy
[1:20:19] Spirit that's the reason we have so
[1:20:21] miserably failed everywhere
[1:20:24] see we got the wealth and we got the
[1:20:28] thing now what will happen so he's going
[1:20:32] to tell you future
[1:20:34] events we're not preaching the gospel we
[1:20:37] got wealth we got these things now what
[1:20:39] will
[1:20:42] happen and when this church World
[1:20:44] Council of churches goes together can't
[1:20:46] you see who's going to do the leading
[1:20:49] can't you methodists Presbyterians
[1:20:52] understand that the rest of you even you
[1:20:53] Pentecostal
[1:20:56] you say you're not going in well either
[1:20:59] go you'll either go in or you'll bust up
[1:21:02] the denomination you do one or the other
[1:21:05] it's right before you got to do it it's
[1:21:08] a forcing the mark of the
[1:21:14] beast here's a
[1:21:18] prophet we had a glitch some of you had
[1:21:21] a hard time making connections
[1:21:25] and everything and Home Depot was shut
[1:21:27] down and Banks were shut down and
[1:21:29] everything over some kind of a little
[1:21:31] computer
[1:21:37] glitch that's just a forerunner that's
[1:21:39] just a little glitch a little little
[1:21:43] speed bump in the roll wait
[1:21:46] until all of this stuff comes together
[1:21:48] in the mark of the beast and you won't
[1:21:50] be able to buy or sell
[1:21:57] you think that this thing is
[1:22:01] harmless I want to ask you which one of
[1:22:03] you willfully fellowships with the
[1:22:06] Harlot
[1:22:08] system which one of you wants to embrace
[1:22:12] Jezebel and her adulterous ways and
[1:22:16] bring her
[1:22:19] daughters huh well but there's such
[1:22:28] denominationalism absolutely I can prove
[1:22:31] it by the Bible is the mark of the
[1:22:33] beast she was a and had prostitute
[1:22:37] daughters and we know that that is the
[1:22:40] truth organized religion that's why
[1:22:42] brother RM said I'm against organized
[1:22:45] religion now think about this in the
[1:22:48] message we know we don't have any quote
[1:22:51] denominations but we got organizations
[1:22:54] yeah we are organizing among ourselves
[1:22:58] and we believe this and we believe that
[1:23:00] and it's us four and you no
[1:23:02] more
[1:23:04] right let's look at it face value
[1:23:10] amen it's contrary to the
[1:23:12] word and it's Antichrist and its
[1:23:15] principles not everything in there is
[1:23:17] Antichrist but in its
[1:23:19] principles it's a Sy the system it's
[1:23:22] Antichrist because it's against the word
[1:23:25] of God every organized system is that
[1:23:31] way I want to ask you what Affinity do
[1:23:34] you
[1:23:35] have with
[1:23:37] Pharaoh what Affinity do you have this
[1:23:40] world because the scripture says if you
[1:23:42] love the world and the things of the
[1:23:49] world the love of God is not even in you
[1:23:53] oh now come on brother Ron it they
[1:23:55] really no come
[1:24:00] on brother Ram said I'm not against the
[1:24:02] people there's good
[1:24:05] people he said it's a system and there's
[1:24:08] a spirit behind it are we aware of that
[1:24:12] he says that's why I'm against organized
[1:24:15] religion why we are not a denomination
[1:24:21] Amen in the sermon or it's Church age
[1:24:25] book pergam and church age so balum got
[1:24:28] Israel to commit
[1:24:32] fornication do you know that physical
[1:24:34] fornication put the quote up here man we
[1:24:36] need to stay with me there we
[1:24:38] go no yeah I want the the one on the on
[1:24:42] the pergan church age so balam got
[1:24:45] Israel to commit fornication do you know
[1:24:47] that physical
[1:24:49] fornication it's the very same spirit
[1:24:51] that lies in organized religion
[1:24:55] okay maybe we're missing
[1:24:57] it I said that the spirit of
[1:25:01] fornication is the
[1:25:03] spirit of organization it's a spirit so
[1:25:08] you hang around somebody with a wrong
[1:25:10] Spirit you wonder why you get some kind
[1:25:13] of adulterous fornicating love the world
[1:25:16] and the things of the world Spirit on
[1:25:18] you
[1:25:25] M it was the Affinity that Solomon had
[1:25:30] with
[1:25:31] Pharaoh that started out looked so
[1:25:34] innocent he all he did was marry his
[1:25:37] daughter yeah well let me see who you
[1:25:40] choose and I'll tell you what kind
[1:25:43] of reflection you got in
[1:25:49] you it doesn't look like the reflection
[1:25:53] at first
[1:25:54] until he gets
[1:25:56] older and this thing goes from its
[1:25:59] infancy until now it goes into
[1:26:03] fullblown okay well look at
[1:26:06] it you see Solomon with all his wisdom
[1:26:10] how can you do it and make such a
[1:26:12] mistake you might be a great leader
[1:26:14] build yourself a a a a a kingdom you
[1:26:17] might be blessed just like Solomon
[1:26:20] was you might be the most famous
[1:26:23] preacher in the message on the
[1:26:25] internet you might be popular and get
[1:26:28] all the likes and subscribe and all this
[1:26:30] and hey
[1:26:32] wow I want to ask the thing brother Bren
[1:26:35] said there's three things that'll take a
[1:26:37] man
[1:26:39] down what are they money women and
[1:26:45] popularity Solomon's got all three
[1:26:59] so it only took a period of 40
[1:27:03] years for this to come from its infancy
[1:27:07] form to take a full manifestation of how
[1:27:10] far he got off and I you know what
[1:27:12] Marvels me is how did the people of
[1:27:16] Israel allow
[1:27:18] it uh uh let me tell you this is mere
[1:27:22] speculation because
[1:27:25] hidden behind all of the wealth the
[1:27:27] wealth opulence and popularity nobody's
[1:27:31] going to criticize
[1:27:35] Solomon man look at that church look at
[1:27:38] the people look at the Chariots the
[1:27:40] horsemen my goodness God has blessed him
[1:27:44] he is doing so well thousands and horses
[1:27:47] and oh my look at this some people are
[1:27:51] so blinded because of big opulence and
[1:27:56] Wealthy sometimes I wonder if we
[1:27:58] wouldn't be better in a swept out
[1:28:03] barroom sitting on a 2x4 like they do in
[1:28:06] Africa not a nice padded chair with a
[1:28:09] lumbar
[1:28:10] support but a
[1:28:12] 2x4 in the heat no air
[1:28:15] conditioning walks 78 hours to get to
[1:28:18] the
[1:28:21] service then they get upset with you
[1:28:23] because you only preach an
[1:28:25] hour you got to be kidding me I walk
[1:28:27] seven hours to get
[1:28:29] here I don't want to I don't want a
[1:28:33] sandwich I don't want an appetizer you
[1:28:36] give me a seven course
[1:28:38] meal
[1:28:40] amen you
[1:28:43] understand sometimes I think we lose our
[1:28:45] blessing CU we got too
[1:28:49] much Lord help us amen I'm not here to
[1:28:53] build a kingdom
[1:28:56] I want to ask how could this
[1:28:58] happen now watch here Ephesian Church AG
[1:29:01] you you can show this quote now because
[1:29:03] you just had it see how it started out
[1:29:05] in the early
[1:29:07] church it was called Deeds then became a
[1:29:10] Doctrine it became the standard it
[1:29:13] became the unbending way it finally took
[1:29:14] over God was pushed aside oh it started
[1:29:17] so small so quietly so
[1:29:20] inoffensively it looks so good it seems
[1:29:23] so sound
[1:29:25] then it caught a hold and like a
[1:29:28] python squeezed out the very breath and
[1:29:30] killed all the spirituality there was in
[1:29:34] it oh that false Vine is
[1:29:39] subtle it's like an angel of
[1:29:42] Light till he gets a hold of
[1:29:46] you and I want to say that I believe in
[1:29:50] leadership it's not the leadership of
[1:29:53] men I believe in
[1:29:57] qualify that brother brandom you believe
[1:30:00] in leadership but don't believe in
[1:30:01] leadership of man watch what he say I
[1:30:04] believe in the leadership of the Holy
[1:30:06] Ghost coming through the word I believe
[1:30:08] also that God has set men in the church
[1:30:10] men who are gifted by the spirit and
[1:30:12] they'll keep the church in order I
[1:30:14] believe that I believe also that the
[1:30:16] church is ruled over by men that God
[1:30:19] sends to take charge but but that rule
[1:30:22] is by the word amen so that it's not the
[1:30:26] man really ruling but the spirit of God
[1:30:28] for the word and the spirit are
[1:30:31] one then he quotes Hebrews 12
[1:30:36] 13:7
[1:30:38] again how in the world through all of
[1:30:42] this wisdom and all that he had does
[1:30:46] Solomon make this
[1:30:49] mistake Nehemiah picks it up these
[1:30:52] answers are found in your Bible Nehemiah
[1:30:55] picks it
[1:30:57] up in chapter 13: 26 and
[1:31:01] 27 did not Solomon king of Israel sin by
[1:31:05] these
[1:31:08] things
[1:31:10] yet among many nations was there no King
[1:31:14] like
[1:31:16] him who was beloved of his God and made
[1:31:20] and God made him King over all Israel
[1:31:22] nevertheless
[1:31:25] even
[1:31:26] him did outlandish women cause to
[1:31:32] sin shall we then
[1:31:35] hearken unto you to do all this great
[1:31:38] evil to transgress against our God in
[1:31:41] marrying
[1:31:43] strange
[1:31:45] wives Nehemiah picks it up do you know
[1:31:48] that the most controversial issue within
[1:31:51] the message right now marriage and
[1:31:52] divorce
[1:31:54] you know why because it deals with the
[1:31:56] original
[1:32:02] sin did not Solomon king of Israel sin
[1:32:06] after these things your Bible does not
[1:32:10] sit there and just cover it
[1:32:12] over shows you there's answers in the
[1:32:17] Bible women
[1:32:19] always signify churches is that right
[1:32:24] let me just throw something out there is
[1:32:26] it
[1:32:27] possible that some of our
[1:32:31] ministers get all kinds of strange wives
[1:32:34] to following
[1:32:36] them and they have this great following
[1:32:38] on YouTube or whatever and it shows oh
[1:32:41] you know what I'm I'm going to be honest

[1:38:43] Lord besides that we might inquire of
[1:38:46] him yeah wish you hadn't
[1:38:50] asked right the king of Israel said you
[1:38:53] yeah there's yet One Man by whom we may
[1:38:57] inquire of the Lord but I hate
[1:39:00] him for he never prophesied good unto
[1:39:04] me but always evil always on my
[1:39:11] case better be careful that guys that's

[1:39:44] what about you
[1:39:47] m he said you'll not go up I see Israel
[1:39:50] scattered like sheep see I told you I I
[1:39:53] hate that
[1:39:55] guy he says go put him in prison and
[1:39:58] when I get back he said if you get
[1:40:03] back
[1:40:05] because he said if you come back God not
[1:40:08] ever even spoke to me oh I want to ask
[1:40:11] you saints of
[1:40:13] God where are the micas within the
[1:40:16] message right now that are not trying to
[1:40:18] follow all of the preachers in all of
[1:40:21] their certain ways
[1:40:23] isn't there somebody that is going to be
[1:40:26] his own
[1:40:27] man isn't there somebody don't is there
[1:40:30] somebody somewhere within the message
[1:40:32] that follows God in God's word oh God
[1:40:35] give us a Mah
[1:40:38] again not
[1:40:41] 400 message preachers yeah yeah
[1:40:47] man excuse me
[1:40:58] in the sermon God keeps his word in
[1:41:02] Jeffersonville he had a motive behind it
[1:41:05] see now what we're all here and having
[1:41:08] such a big time will you go up to Routh
[1:41:11] Gilead with me to battle because
[1:41:13] actually Syria has it up there and
[1:41:16] ramoth Gilead belongs to me it's
[1:41:20] rightful we have the right we're the
[1:41:23] first church we have the right you see
[1:41:25] it then Jehosaphat said well now being
[1:41:29] that we're having a good time and my men
[1:41:32] is like your men why we're all believers
[1:41:35] anyhow so let's just associate
[1:41:39] together he made a vital
[1:41:42] mistake he did and jehos bat being
[1:41:45] spiritual enough as I believe with all
[1:41:48] my heart that was a type of this day
[1:41:50] surely somewhere somehow God God will
[1:41:53] get the message to the True
[1:41:55] Heart amen Solomon gave God his head but
[1:42:00] not his
[1:42:03] heart so many scriptures say in Solomon
[1:42:06] God spoke to him thou has not walked in
[1:42:09] thy heart pure like thy father
[1:42:12] David oh my
[1:42:15] goodness he said in the beginning he
[1:42:17] would so he's got the problem lined up
[1:42:20] see sure I'll go up with you but he said
[1:42:23] wait wait a minute I before we go we
[1:42:25] ought to ask the Lord don't you think so
[1:42:27] if we're all believers why don't we ask
[1:42:29] the
[1:42:31] Lord I think that's a good thing you
[1:42:34] know before you make any kind of
[1:42:36] decision why don't you ask God amen amen
[1:42:39] get on your knees ask God God what what
[1:42:41] do you say about
[1:42:46] this now brother Brenham refers to
[1:42:51] Solomon so much of the time
[1:42:54] I quote it many times in a marriage
[1:42:58] ceremony now here's the wisest of all
[1:43:01] men and he's about to give you some real
[1:43:04] wisdom and sisters listen up to this
[1:43:08] here's the wisest of all men giving you
[1:43:10] Godly
[1:43:12] advice I hope every young man here when
[1:43:15] he gets married he'll get uh he'll get a
[1:43:18] wife and you'll have a happy together
[1:43:19] his wife and I have 22 years that that
[1:43:23] we've been
[1:43:24] married he who has found a wife he's
[1:43:26] found a good thing as Solomon said a
[1:43:29] good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown
[1:43:33] an unrighteous one is water in his
[1:43:38] blood and his blood stream is his life
[1:43:42] so an unrighteous one is the wrong thing
[1:43:45] he can get a hold of and the righteous
[1:43:47] one's the best thing he can get a hold
[1:43:48] of outside his salvation is that right
[1:43:51] amen amen come on all of you amen amen
[1:43:56] yeah see the women when I kind of get to
[1:44:00] cutting the other night with the
[1:44:02] scripture on these Pentecostal women the
[1:44:06] way they're dressing wearing their hair
[1:44:08] going on you
[1:44:10] say you don't make any
[1:44:13] difference that excuse me that doesn't
[1:44:15] make any
[1:44:17] difference sure
[1:44:19] does oh brother Ron what's wrong with us
[1:44:22] Tri in her hair a little
[1:44:26] bit brother Brenan was asked the
[1:44:28] question what would cause a woman to
[1:44:30] trim her
[1:44:31] hair he said an UNL
[1:44:36] ungodly Spirit of the
[1:44:38] devil cause a woman to trim her in fact
[1:44:42] the scripture says if a woman cuts her
[1:44:44] hair let her be sh you can look just
[1:44:47] like me and brother
[1:44:51] Paul yeah
[1:44:56] because if you cut it you might as well
[1:44:57] be
[1:44:58] sh that's what the Bible says because if
[1:45:01] you cut your hair you dishonor your head
[1:45:04] and brother Brenham said in many quotes
[1:45:07] and you know this he says why a
[1:45:10] dishonorable woman you can divorce her
[1:45:12] and put her away cuz she cut her
[1:45:17] hair why he takes it to the fact because
[1:45:20] the head of every man is Christ yes and
[1:45:24] the head of Christ is God Amen so when
[1:45:26] she trims her hair what kind of spirit
[1:45:28] is that that's okay come on brother Ron
[1:45:32] little split
[1:45:34] ends and guess what I remember I think
[1:45:36] we were in Canada when some of the
[1:45:38] sister said we don't trim our hair we
[1:45:40] burn
[1:45:41] it yeah they they would take a match
[1:45:45] and so they didn't cut their
[1:45:49] hair my brother my sister and you know
[1:45:53] what listen uh up there in Canada where
[1:45:56] we were at we we had horrible water and
[1:45:59] most of the women had hair to about
[1:46:01] their shoulder length and they'd grown
[1:46:03] it for years and years because their
[1:46:05] hair was so
[1:46:09] unhealthy
[1:46:11] my and I said well let's
[1:46:15] pray I said and God will give you along
[1:46:18] there we had to drive I think it was 10
[1:46:21] or 12 miles till G go get water from a
[1:46:24] well to be able that Sandy and my
[1:46:27] daughter could wash their hair in well
[1:46:30] water instead of the water from the
[1:46:41] city brother Ram says and hear ye him
[1:46:45] because we're talking about spirits
[1:46:46] right part of it
[1:46:49] demonology how in the world could this
[1:46:51] little demon spirit get past the wisdom
[1:46:54] of
[1:46:55] Solomon God gave him this
[1:46:58] wisdom yeah but remember man is right in
[1:47:00] his own eyes so now he's going to
[1:47:02] justify this but watch here and hear ye
[1:47:05] him
[1:47:09] in Middletown Ohio and now to you
[1:47:12] Holiness people Pentecostal Free
[1:47:14] Methodist nazarenes Pilgrim Holiness I
[1:47:17] remember the time when it was wrong for
[1:47:18] a woman to cut her hair what happened do
[1:47:22] you know the Bible gives a man a right
[1:47:23] to
[1:47:24] divorce from his uh to get a divorce
[1:47:28] from his wife when she cuts her hair the
[1:47:30] Bible said that a woman that cuts her
[1:47:31] hair dishonors her head that's truth and
[1:47:34] you get out here with these little old
[1:47:36] dirty nasty filthy clothes on called
[1:47:40] shorts mow the grass in the backyard and
[1:47:42] call yourself a Christian how must the
[1:47:45] Holy Spirit feel before the father when
[1:47:48] he has to bring that up oh you say I
[1:47:51] don't wear shorts brother brand I wear
[1:47:52] where slacks that's worse you know
[1:47:55] that's the truth the Bible said that a
[1:47:56] woman will put on a garment pertains to
[1:47:58] a man's abomination in the sight of the
[1:48:00] Lord sight of him that's right that's
[1:48:03] the
[1:48:04] scripture amen what about a man putting
[1:48:07] on a garment pertaining to a
[1:48:11] woman yeah CU we always get on the women
[1:48:14] what about the men you put on these
[1:48:16] shorts he said that's women's
[1:48:18] underwear then you get out here and you
[1:48:20] put it on your Instagram and you sitting
[1:48:22] there with a bunch of you
[1:48:25] Jezebel's you ain't
[1:48:28] converted you got a spirit on you all
[1:48:31] right not the holy spirit it's the
[1:48:32] unclean spirit it's
[1:48:34] Jezebel you understand that's why you
[1:48:36] can fellowship with the Harlot system
[1:48:38] and it don't convict
[1:48:41] you let me tell you take a holy ghost
[1:48:44] filled Christian and put it ACH uh put
[1:48:47] him amongst a bunch of unbelievers and
[1:48:50] guess what you will either convict their
[1:48:53] lives and they won't even like you being
[1:48:56] around or you'll become one of
[1:48:59] them oh I don't see it so
[1:49:04] bad especially that pretty
[1:49:07] girl yeah she kind of likes me man never
[1:49:12] had a girl in the message like
[1:49:14] me but this one o la
[1:49:23] what kind of spirit would cause a man to
[1:49:24] wear
[1:49:26] shorts hanging around immoral
[1:49:29] people it's a spirit yeah I'm going
[1:49:34] slow not a lot of amening and
[1:49:40] stuff in the sermon the voice of the
[1:49:42] sign watch this remember there was a
[1:49:44] group one time great man named
[1:49:47] Ahab he got 400 Israeli prophets now
[1:49:51] that wasn't Heathen Prophets 400
[1:49:53] Israelite prophets there was a Godly Man
[1:49:56] by name of Jehoshaphat who was king of
[1:49:58] Judah and he come down and there was and
[1:50:02] there's where a Believer got mixed up
[1:50:03] with an
[1:50:05] unbeliever see and then things went
[1:50:10] wrong we say we all are we all still
[1:50:13] believing the
[1:50:14] message see what he said brother on say
[1:50:17] what's yeah I'm saying
[1:50:20] it I'm not adding to I'm just saying
[1:50:22] what he
[1:50:24] said he saith rth Gilead now watch this
[1:50:28] how true it can be said rth Gilead
[1:50:31] belongs to us up there up in the part of
[1:50:33] the country up there that's ours Joshua
[1:50:35] in dividing up the lands give it to
[1:50:37] Israel and the Philistines heathens come
[1:50:39] over and took it away from them he said
[1:50:42] that belongs to us now watch how
[1:50:45] fundamentally people can be right and
[1:50:47] yet miss
[1:50:50] it takes a prophet to see these
[1:50:53] things fundamentally right it's ours
[1:50:57] belongs to us and miss it
[1:51:00] watch the thing actually did belong to
[1:51:03] Israel but all of God's promises brother
[1:51:06] is on condition see if they walk before
[1:51:10] the
[1:51:11] Lord see that
[1:51:16] condition fundamentally right and yet
[1:51:19] miss
[1:51:21] it how could
[1:51:23] Solomon miss
[1:51:26] it Behold a greater than Solomon is here
[1:51:30] if Jonah under those circumstances could
[1:51:33] believe a prayer that was made by a man
[1:51:35] that later backslid because of women as
[1:51:38] Solomon wow you see until you go to
[1:51:42] studying this you kind of pass over all
[1:51:45] this stuff about
[1:51:47] Solomon now when these things were done
[1:51:49] the princes came to me saying the people
[1:51:51] of Israel the priest oh we got to go to
[1:51:54] the scripture I'm sorry go to Ezra
[1:51:56] chapter 9 Ezra how many of you like
[1:52:02] Ezra
[1:52:06] Ezra I don't know if he was an engineer
[1:52:08] or not I think he was he helped build
[1:52:10] walls and all that
[1:52:14] stuff now when these things were
[1:52:18] done the princes came to me saying the
[1:52:21] people of Israel and the priests and the
[1:52:25] Levites have not separated themselves
[1:52:27] from the people of the lands doing
[1:52:30] according to their Abominations even of
[1:52:33] the Canaanites the Mi the mittit the
[1:52:40] perizzites and jebusites and ammonites
[1:52:43] and moabites and Egyptians and
[1:52:47] amorites and they have taken their
[1:52:49] daughters for themselves and for their
[1:52:51] sons so that the holy seed mingled
[1:52:56] themselves with the people of those
[1:52:58] lands yay the
[1:53:00] hand of the P the hand of the princes
[1:53:03] and rulers hath been Chief in this
[1:53:08] trespass who was the worst
[1:53:13] leaders Ezra caught it man he
[1:53:17] said even the priests and the Levites
[1:53:20] they're the worst
[1:53:27] in the sermon marriage and divorce
[1:53:30] 1965 Brothers s now what about today
[1:53:33] what's the god of the United
[1:53:37] States what's the god of the United
[1:53:40] States you remember in the Tabernacle
[1:53:42] years ago I preached on that the God of
[1:53:45] this modern day a little flapper sitting
[1:53:48] up there with makeup on dress pulled up
[1:53:50] over her knees things like that said
[1:53:52] behold your
[1:53:54] God that's right she's on every
[1:53:58] advertisement half
[1:54:02] naked it's an instrument of
[1:54:06] Satan from the beginning Jesus saw says
[1:54:11] see we see that it's so now in from the
[1:54:16] beginning and that's what he's talking
[1:54:18] about see the heathens used to make her
[1:54:20] a god did you know that a goddess the
[1:54:23] heathens made her a God made her a
[1:54:26] goddess sure did they make her a goddess
[1:54:30] for they did have sex
[1:54:32] acts in their worship do we have that
[1:54:35] quote come on man did I mess it up and
[1:54:38] not give you the the quotes because th
[1:54:41] this is what he said he said they had
[1:54:43] sex acts in their worship
[1:54:48] service
[1:54:50] my they make her a god they did had sex
[1:54:53] acts see they claim that she was the
[1:54:55] creator in her womb she carried the seed
[1:54:58] and created it's a lie there's only one
[1:55:00] Creator and that's God but you remember
[1:55:02] Paul there Diana of Ephesus image of a
[1:55:05] rock and the goddess of Heaven throw
[1:55:08] down don't you see how Heathen worship
[1:55:11] is we know

[1:55:21] again to women the very lowest creature
[1:55:23] on earth and women
[1:55:26] worship she will sway any man the way
[1:55:29] she wants to and not knowing all that
[1:55:31] beauty on the outside that is Hell on
[1:55:34] the inside Solomon said her Gates is the
[1:55:37] gates To
[1:55:42] Hell how many know the beauty is
[1:55:49] deceitful nothing but vanity
[1:55:53] they say billions of dollars every
[1:55:56] year is made on
[1:55:58] makeup and things so that you can stay
[1:56:04] young wrinkle
[1:56:08] cream
[1:56:12] um it's
[1:56:20] everywhere it's a Mega billion doll
[1:56:26] business men and women dye their hair
[1:56:29] because it turns
[1:56:32] gray brother Bram said now look I got no
[1:56:35] scripture about you dying your hair but
[1:56:38] I ask you
[1:56:40] sisters why can't we age
[1:56:43] gracefully well I started getting gray
[1:56:45] my mother started turning gray when she
[1:56:48] was 18 and she had this streak like
[1:56:51] Tulsa gabard
[1:56:54] and everybody come up to my mother it
[1:56:56] looks so
[1:56:57] beautiful well I understand maybe if
[1:57:00] you're 15 and you're turning gray you
[1:57:02] might want to dye your
[1:57:05] hair okay because you got to try to
[1:57:07] impress somebody and when you snag the
[1:57:09] guy and you got him go ahead and let it
[1:57:11] turn
[1:57:15] gray I got to let you laugh a little bit
[1:57:18] now I I remember brother Mario and God
[1:57:21] bless you you for your gray hair because
[1:57:25] and and the reason I say this is one of

[1:57:43] started
[1:57:45] laughing we di
[1:57:48] it you you what

[2:00:00] that if you do push aways more than
[2:00:03] pull-ups you'd be all
[2:00:05] right push away from the
[2:00:10] table Moses had a remedy from the word
[2:00:15] for the issue for Solomon Deuteronomy
[2:00:20] 12 veres 2 through four and ye shall
[2:00:23] utterly destroy all the places whereupon
[2:00:26] the Nations which ye shall possess serve
[2:00:30] their gods upon the high mountains upon
[2:00:32] the hills and under every Green Tree and
[2:00:34] ye shall overthrow their altars break
[2:00:37] their pillars burn their Groves with
[2:00:39] fire and you shall heue down the Grave
[2:00:42] images of their gods and destroy the
[2:00:44] names of them out of the place you shall
[2:00:47] not do so unto the Lord your God now in
[2:00:51] close
[2:00:53] Here's the Clincher so let's nail it
[2:00:56] down and clinch the nail in First Kings
[2:01:00] chapter
[2:01:04] 11 and King Solomon loved many
[2:01:09] strange
[2:01:11] women why does it call them strange
[2:01:15] women Why didn't it just say many
[2:01:18] women I mean when you you know so I
[2:01:20] thought hey what does the word strange
[2:01:23] what is it strange women are
[2:01:27] they I don't think he would have loved
[2:01:32] them honest with you yeah I want her
[2:01:36] that strange one over
[2:01:39] there the strange in
[2:01:43] Scripture it comes from he Hebrew no
[2:01:47] which means
[2:01:49] adulterous means different means means
[2:01:56] outlandish these strange outlandish
[2:01:59] adulterous women he loved
[2:02:03] them and together with the daughter of
[2:02:05] pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites
[2:02:09] Zid zidonians and Hittites and
[2:02:12] the Nations concerning which the Lord
[2:02:14] said unto the children of Israel you
[2:02:16] shall not go in unto them neither shall
[2:02:19] they come in unto you for surely they
[2:02:22] will turn away your heart after their
[2:02:25] gods Solomon clave unto these in
[2:02:31] love and he had 700 wives
[2:02:35] princesses and 300 concubines and his
[2:02:43] wives turned away his
[2:02:50] heart what ever you have an affinity
[2:02:54] for his
[2:02:57] wives turned away his heart for it came
[2:03:00] to pass when Solomon was
[2:03:02] old that his wives turned away his heart
[2:03:05] from after their gods and his heart was
[2:03:08] not perfect with the Lord his God as was
[2:03:11] the heart of David see do you see the
[2:03:13] head versus
[2:03:18] heart Solomon went after ashtra the
[2:03:22] goddess of of the zidonians and after
[2:03:25] milcom the abomination of the
[2:03:28] ammonites and Solomon did evil in the
[2:03:30] sight of the Lord and went not fully
[2:03:33] after the
[2:03:34] Lord as did David his
[2:03:38] father then did Solomon build an high
[2:03:41] place for Kos the abomination of Moab in
[2:03:45] the hill that was before Jerusalem and
[2:03:47] for MCH the abomination of the children
[2:03:49] of Ammon and likewise did he for all
[2:03:51] strange
[2:03:53] wives which burnt incest and S incense
[2:03:57] and sacrificed under their
[2:04:00] gods the Lord was angry with
[2:04:05] Solomon because his
[2:04:08] heart was turned from the Lord God of
[2:04:17] Israel which had appeared to him twice
[2:04:25] God Appears to him
[2:04:29] twice God said because you didn't ask
[2:04:31] for yourself I'm going to give you
[2:04:34] wisdom because you didn't ask for money
[2:04:37] I'm going to give you some money there's
[2:04:39] nothing wrong with
[2:04:40] money as long as it's kept in the right
[2:04:48] channel the Lord was angry with Solomon
[2:04:51] because his heart was turned from the
[2:04:52] Lord God of Israel which appeared unto
[2:04:54] him twice and commanded him concerning
[2:04:58] this thing God command God appeared to
[2:05:01] him twice and commanded
[2:05:05] him that he should not go after other
[2:05:08] gods that he kept not that which the
[2:05:11] Lord God
[2:05:15] commanded My My My
[2:05:18] Strange great lesson to be learned here
[2:05:21] isn't
[2:05:23] I've never heard
[2:05:24] a minister in the message preach on
[2:05:26] Solomon or his
[2:05:29] Heir I've never looked those quotes up
[2:05:31] brother brm said he died backslid and
[2:05:33] caused Israel to
[2:05:37] backslide and then God says because you
[2:05:41] have done this I tell you what I'm going
[2:05:42] to do I'm going to raise up two
[2:05:44] adversaries and I'm going to Ren the
[2:05:46] Kingdom from you and guess what they're
[2:05:47] going to be part of your family
[2:05:52] so God raises up said okay
[2:05:57] Solomon I'm going to keep one part
[2:05:59] because of David the
[2:06:02] rest go read the rest of First Kings 11
[2:06:07] it's
[2:06:08] sobering it's very
[2:06:11] sobering and yet he's the
[2:06:13] same yesterday today and
[2:06:18] forever wow
[2:06:21] could it be that we have within the
[2:06:25] message that we have some that let me
[2:06:27] tell you the way that they can put it
[2:06:31] together in their wisdom and my my just
[2:06:34] so popular with the
[2:06:37] people and yet out here and claiming to
[2:06:40] have all these
[2:06:43] wives could it be happening again today
[2:06:46] I'm just asking
[2:06:49] you you judge it
[2:06:53] yourself I had a brother musicians if
[2:06:56] you come I had a brother that he
[2:06:59] believed in being a pastor of many
[2:07:02] churches he said that way brother Ron
[2:07:04] you just have a church here Church there
[2:07:06] and you can live off the money they send
[2:07:09] you I told him I said I don't believe in
[2:07:11] that I said I believe in being the
[2:07:13] pastor of one wife husband of one why
[2:07:16] and everything and but everywhere he
[2:07:19] went that's what he did he'd start a
[2:07:22] church and he get them and they'd be
[2:07:23] under him next thing you know they got
[2:07:25] all these churches and he's the he's the
[2:07:28] pastor of all these churches so all
[2:07:30] these churches send him money but where
[2:07:32] do you end
[2:07:37] up I wonder if they're strange because
[2:07:41] the Bible says they go from house to
[2:07:42] house leading what kind of
[2:07:45] women silly
[2:07:47] women and now you don't even have to go
[2:07:50] house to house all you got to do is they
[2:07:52] click on it comes right into your living
[2:07:55] room comes right to where you're
[2:07:58] at lead silly women Laden away with
[2:08:04] divers
[2:08:06] lust you understand that's
[2:08:11] why oh
[2:08:14] God here's where I I don't know that
[2:08:17] this will be my next sermon but I want
[2:08:19] to launch off this right now and just to
[2:08:21] say we need a greater than
[2:08:27] Solomon that's why he said the greater
[2:08:30] than Solomon is here
[2:08:33] now because Solomon backslid he went
[2:08:36] away because of strange women but
[2:08:39] there's one now that is so faithful it's
[2:08:41] the Holy Spirit he will lead you and
[2:08:44] guide you into all
[2:08:47] truth amen God bless you thank you for
[2:08:51] coming today thank you for listening
[2:08:53] sitting intently and yes I can get a
[2:08:56] little rough on these things but I'm
[2:08:58] showing you it's
[2:09:00] Spirits it's Spirits because you
[2:09:03] remember we were talking about how that
[2:09:07] try the spirits of them that say that
[2:09:10] they are Apostles and are not found them
[2:09:11] to be
[2:09:12] Liars because we've got to have
[2:09:14] discernment of spirit
[2:09:17] [Music]
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:28] now because I don't like leaving on a
[2:09:33] particularly let's say low
[2:09:37] note I want to say but at the end of the
[2:09:41] road and after everything is said and
[2:09:44] done guess what Solomon will be
[2:09:46] [Music]
[2:09:49] there he cannot forget his
[2:09:52] own yeah God was upset with him yeah God
[2:09:56] took the Kingdom from
[2:09:58] him but how many of you are going to
[2:10:01] shake your fist at him and say what a
[2:10:04] foolish mistake you know
[2:10:08] [Music]
[2:10:15] what it's him
[2:10:18] Saints through all of this that we go
[2:10:20] through
[2:10:22] through the tangents through the ups and
[2:10:24] downs through the faults and failures
[2:10:26] guess
[2:10:28] what it was
[2:10:33] him so even though Solomon had done such
[2:10:37] a terrible
[2:10:39] mistake I believe one day when we get
[2:10:41] over there I'm not saying
[2:10:44] [Music]
[2:10:47] bride but I'm saying salvation over
[2:10:50] there one of them
[2:10:53] [Music]
[2:10:55] yes
[2:10:57] never never put a period on somebody if
[2:11:00] they make a mistake and say well he did
[2:11:03] this so I'll tell you what he's
[2:11:06] [Music]
[2:11:09] out even as Saul the Bible says and Saul
[2:11:12] became an enemy to God remember he goes
[2:11:15] to the witch of Endor I've told you this
[2:11:17] many
[2:11:18] times and the witch calls up Samuel
[2:11:20] Samuel he says wherefore hast thou
[2:11:23] called me up seeing thou has become an
[2:11:26] enemy to
[2:11:27] [Music]
[2:11:30] God amazing thing he said God's going to
[2:11:33] take your life from
[2:11:36] you he
[2:11:38] [Music]
[2:11:39] said but tomorrow you'll be with
[2:11:44] me figure it out
[2:11:46] Saints they said is Saul going to be in
[2:11:50] hell cuz he was an enemy enemy to
[2:11:52] God he said you can't put Saul in Hell
[2:11:56] unless you put Samuel there cuz Samuel
[2:11:58] said tomorrow you be with
[2:12:02] me I don't have it all figured out this
[2:12:06] was one question that I have had on my
[2:12:08] heart for years and I thought you know
[2:12:11] what I'm going to research this out and
[2:12:13] what
[2:12:14] was the heor of
[2:12:17] Solomon what was it that he did wrong
[2:12:19] and why did his wisdom miss it let's

[2:14:26] more how I
[2:14:28] long to be
[2:14:31] deeper in
[2:14:33] love the Bible says that Solomon loved
[2:14:38] God he loved the
[2:14:42] Lord he just made a
[2:14:47] mistake he had an affinity with
[2:14:50] something he should have
[2:14:51] [Music]
[2:14:53] and in the third verse he goes and
[2:14:55] starts sacrificing in high places
[2:14:59] idolatry was already started
[2:15:04] DIY how easily it's
[2:15:07] overlooked and yet we go back in the
[2:15:09] Bible we see there's answers Nehemiah
[2:15:14] Ezra it happens Thou shalt not when you
[2:15:18] go and here we are in laiaa right in the
[2:15:21] midst of the worst of all ages you girls

[2:15:37] Hollywood don't try to
[2:15:39] [Music]
[2:15:43] compete the Bible says and let the aged
[2:15:46] women the older women teach the
[2:15:49] younger how to love their husbands be
[2:15:51] Chas keepers of the
[2:15:53] home he said don't try to dress like
[2:15:59] Hollywood form
[2:16:02] fitting showing off your
[2:16:06] body said don't you realize that's a
[2:16:09] immoral Spirit on
[2:16:12] you see he shows it in its infancy form
[2:16:17] that's why I'm
[2:16:23] sometimes I think you know what I'm just
[2:16:25] a I'm just an angry old
[2:16:30] [Music]
[2:16:32] man I'm just a old
[2:16:35] [Music]
[2:16:38] fogy why don't you lighten up a little
[2:16:41] bit Ronald
[2:16:54] why do you have to preach stuff like
[2:16:58] this if you really loved it why why why
[2:17:01] don't you teach us deeper things like uh
[2:17:03] the gifts of the Spirit why don't you
[2:17:05] teach us you know the seven levels of
[2:17:09] heaven and all of this stuff and and get
[2:17:12] us all excited and everything and yet we
[2:17:14] miss the very thing and Solomon loved
[2:17:18] God and he had an affinity with Pharaoh
[2:17:22] why why Solomon you made your mistake
[2:17:28] man why didn't a Prophet come up and
[2:17:30] tell him why didn't say you shouldn't do
[2:17:33] it Solomon you need to
[2:17:37] repent I told you the history there was
[2:17:40] not one woman he married was from
[2:17:44] Israel was all politically then I asked
[2:17:47] does God overlook that and say it's okay
[2:17:52] when the very
[2:17:53] scriptures is against it so God loving
[2:17:58] Solomon told him because you have done
[2:18:01] this and you haven't kept my way I'm
[2:18:03] going to Ren the Kingdom from you you're
[2:18:05] going to suffer
[2:18:07] Solomon yet he's going to be
[2:18:11] saved he's God's not going to send him
[2:18:14] to hell just made a terrible mistake God
[2:18:18] help us here in this this hour
[2:18:21] Lord don't let some kind of little
[2:18:23] Affinity that shouldn't be there be
[2:18:26] there you know yeah I can give up
[2:18:28] everything to Christ except for sports I
[2:18:31] can give up everything except for the
[2:18:35] internet I can give up everything
[2:18:37] whatever be some kind of affinity that
