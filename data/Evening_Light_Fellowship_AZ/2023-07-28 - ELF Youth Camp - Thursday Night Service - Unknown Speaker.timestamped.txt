[8:49] welcome you all to all our our visitors
[8:51] to our local assembly we say God richly
[8:54] bless you and uh my name is brother
[8:57] Stephen McNeely I'm the associate pastor
[9:00] there at elf and I work alongside
[9:03] brother Ron and the rest of the the
[9:05] brother and their church and in the
[9:07] ministry and um we just we have some
[9:11] things that we would like to bring forth
[9:13] to you this evening before uh we have
[9:16] the ministering of the word a few little
[9:18] announcements few rules
[9:21] etc etc and I know that young people are
[9:24] very very good at following rules aren't
[9:26] you extremely good
[9:28] and so when I give the rules when we
[9:31] give our expectations I know for a fact
[9:34] that each and every one of you are going
[9:36] to follow it to the T
[9:39] absolutely because you're young people
[9:41] and that's what young people do best and
[9:44] so we have uh we have some slides here
[9:47] that we would like to start
[9:50] this is brother Ron and sister Sandy
[9:52] there are Camp hosts and uh you know we
[9:56] just are so privileged to have them as
[9:58] our pastor and our pastor's wife and and
[10:01] the dedication and the the heart that
[10:03] they have for for young people a heart
[10:06] that they have to see young people
[10:08] birthed into the body of Christ and so
[10:11] let's just give brother Ron and sister
[10:12] Sandy
[10:14] brother Ron sister Sandy stand up so
[10:16] everybody can see you
[10:18] look there they are right there look
[10:19] right here
[10:20] yeah
[10:25] praise the Lord let's go to our next
[10:27] slide okay this year at camp we have 86
[10:30] girls and 89 boys we have 18 counselors
[10:35] and um if you have an emergency or
[10:38] something like that or if you need to
[10:40] talk to a counselor each of you have
[10:42] been assigned a counselor to your dorm
[10:45] or to your cabin and
[10:48] you know it's very hard to choose and
[10:51] pick counselors for a camp every year
[10:54] you have to pick someone who has a love
[10:56] for God someone who holds a standard in
[10:59] their lives someone who's dependable and
[11:00] someone who's very reliable and that's
[11:04] that's how we have chosen the counselors
[11:06] this year and um and just in a few
[11:09] moments uh after I get through this
[11:11] slide here perhaps we'll have all the
[11:13] counselors just come up and do a walk
[11:15] through uh and greet you tell them tell
[11:18] you their name so on and so forth
[11:20] because a lot of times what happens is
[11:22] this uh you have a guy like me
[11:27] yeah I'm a minister and I'm associate
[11:29] yeah and I'm a counselor here but when
[11:31] everybody sees me out there I look like
[11:33] a camper
[11:37] you say well brother Stephen you can't
[11:38] be over 19 years old yeah 35 years old
[11:42] and so what happens is we get caught up
[11:45] with well he's just a counselor whatever
[11:46] so we want all you guys to know exactly
[11:50] who the counselors are
[11:52] so that whenever you go to take the golf
[11:54] cart and you see a counselor that's
[11:56] nearby you'll know not to do it
[11:59] There are rules for the golf carts guys
[12:01] we're going to get into that here in a
[12:03] second and I know you are all very very
[12:05] good very very good at following rules
[12:10] our camp nurse this year is Sister Anne
[12:13] love all sister and over here if you
[12:15] could stand so everybody could see you
[12:16] [Applause]
[12:21] and her assistant Bethany Lovell Bethany
[12:24] stand for us please
[12:26] [Applause]
[12:31] and so if you have a headache if you got
[12:34] something that's wrong or whatever it
[12:37] might be you don't need to go to your
[12:39] dorms you don't need to go out to your
[12:40] cabins to to get your stomach medicine
[12:42] no we have nurses that are right here in
[12:45] service that have everything that you
[12:47] have need of it'll take care of that
[12:49] upset stomach or whatever it might be
[12:51] Camp security is brother Michael and
[12:54] sister Monica Lovell if they could both
[12:56] stand
[12:57] there they are over here in the corner
[13:02] and I'm actually I'm actually going to
[13:04] have brother Mike you'll come here and
[13:06] he's gonna uh just say a few words a few
[13:09] words of expectations and different
[13:11] things of cancer brother Michael if you
[13:13] would like to come
[13:16] that's a mean looking security guard
[13:18] right there
[13:22] in our family I was Grace and that was
[13:24] the law
[13:27] but I'm I'm happy to be here and uh
[13:31] I don't know why but when I came in here
[13:33] I've been so busy since we got here just
[13:36] helping and doing it as soon as I walked
[13:38] in right there
[13:40] something just struck me like
[13:43] he's here
[13:44] and and you think that you know what
[13:46] we're just Gathering we're going to have
[13:47] fun we're hard but you know what he's
[13:49] here I'm just
[13:50] I know that's not what you wanted to
[13:52] study you were going to hear but I'm
[13:53] just telling you he's here
[13:56] and I
[13:57] he's right there
[13:58] and uh
[14:00] so with that said
[14:02] everybody that's here
[14:04] you've Associated your seeing yourself
[14:06] as a as a believer
[14:09] otherwise you know what you wouldn't be
[14:11] here
[14:12] so you chose to fill something out I'm a
[14:14] believer I'm going to go to a Believer
[14:15] camp
[14:16] I want to hear the word of God I want a
[14:18] fellowship this is places where you make
[14:21] friends for life
[14:23] it's different than going to Camp you
[14:26] know out there and somewhere else
[14:29] you will make friends for life
[14:31] and you might yeah you could
[14:36] you knew it I don't even have to answer
[14:38] that but that I'm serious that's
[14:40] that's what's awesome about
[14:42] being associated with believe as a
[14:44] believer
[14:45] so if you're here you're Associated
[14:46] believer and you know what Believers
[14:48] have higher standards
[14:50] they live by different different
[14:53] expectations
[14:55] it's no different than that slave that
[14:57] when he came over and they said there's
[14:58] something different about him why
[15:00] and he said he said because from his
[15:03] homeland
[15:04] his father was the king
[15:07] What About Us
[15:09] your father's the king
[15:11] not
[15:12] a king he's the king
[15:15] so with that said
[15:17] you know what hey let's let's let's do
[15:19] our part you know what you you may Camp
[15:21] what what it is right
[15:24] if it's a drag then you didn't do
[15:26] something right get in make friends meet
[15:29] people
[15:30] follow the rules that's that's the
[15:32] easiest thing you know what as security
[15:34] all I want to be is
[15:36] is seen
[15:38] you don't want to notice me
[15:40] there's a difference because if you
[15:43] notice me then somehow for some reason
[15:45] I'm around you close by and you notice
[15:47] and I'm there are you doing something
[15:49] wrong right
[15:50] so they say hey it's okay to be seen
[15:52] just don't get noticed
[15:54] right
[15:56] so that that you know what I'm very
[15:58] approachable you got anything we're just
[16:01] here to to make everything just go
[16:02] smooth
[16:03] you know and and I believe it will
[16:06] because you guys are believers
[16:09] okay God bless you
[16:11] [Applause]
[16:16] being a Believer brings a responsibility
[16:20] of a believer
[16:22] and so because we are believers we
[16:25] behave ourselves as Believers not as
[16:28] worldly people amen okay next slide
[16:34] okay announcement
[16:37] we'll have a devotional every Monday
[16:39] every morning at 7 00 a.m to 7 45 a.m if
[16:44] this is your first time at our camp uh
[16:47] it's always a very special special time
[16:50] where our pastor has a 45-minute
[16:52] devotional he speaks whatever God has
[16:55] put on his heart and it's very personal
[16:57] it's very nice and um it is optional but
[17:01] let me encourage each one of you tried
[17:04] to make it make it a point to go to the
[17:07] devotionals because it actually believe
[17:09] it or not it'll encourage us it'll
[17:12] encourage your counselor it'll encourage
[17:14] our pastor and so it is down there where
[17:17] the uh the restaurant there is where you
[17:20] eat uh that where we signed up and
[17:23] everything that's where it's going to be
[17:24] right there what time is it out in the
[17:26] morning
[17:27] so what time do you get up in the
[17:29] morning
[17:30] 6 58 right
[17:33] you're teenagers I understand okay this
[17:37] person this the in the white You Gotta
[17:39] Wear Sunscreen
[17:41] it is hot out and not only is it hot out
[17:44] and we are at on higher altitude and you
[17:47] will get sunburned it's just a fact of
[17:50] life so if you have sunscreen please
[17:51] wear it if you're getting burnt and you
[17:53] don't have sunscreen see Sister Ann or
[17:56] sister Bethany Lovell another thing we
[17:58] need to drink lots of water lots of
[18:00] water if you're getting thirsty you've
[18:02] waited too long to drink water it's just
[18:04] how it is so when you entered in here uh
[18:08] this evening to come into the church
[18:09] there was a a water thing out there
[18:13] where you could get cold Waters we just
[18:15] asked that whenever you you get a water
[18:18] bottle don't just take a little drink of
[18:20] it and set it down because you don't
[18:23] want to pick up somebody else's water
[18:25] bottle and you know you know what
[18:27] happens when you drink out of someone
[18:28] else's water bottle right
[18:30] you get goodies it happens so we don't
[18:33] want that to happen at camp this year so
[18:35] when you get a water bottle drink your
[18:37] water bottle and then throw it where
[18:40] in the trash you guys are excellent very
[18:42] good
[18:43] uh song specials there will be a sign up
[18:46] sheet now just so you guys know this
[18:50] door here is out of bounds for this
[18:52] Sanctuary we do not enter this door and
[18:55] we do not exit this door this is just a
[18:57] door this is our main entrance and our
[19:00] main exit right here as you walked in
[19:02] um there will be a sign up sheet there
[19:04] should be already there on the the
[19:07] exterior doors there if God has put a
[19:10] song on your heart and you would like to
[19:12] sing uh you gotta practice the song so
[19:15] the musicians and everybody else is all
[19:17] in tune and it's just it goes smoothly
[19:20] and it's really nice so if you would
[19:21] like to sing a song special whether it's
[19:24] yourself whether you have a group of
[19:25] people
[19:27] um there's a sign up sheet you need to
[19:29] sign up for a time to practice in order
[19:32] to sing your song you've got to practice
[19:34] so you've got to show up and you got to
[19:36] practice this song Everybody understand
[19:38] okay praise the Lord
[19:41] um
[19:42] rules and guidelines these are the ones
[19:45] that we love
[19:47] um do not leave to campgrounds
[19:50] very very simple rule
[19:52] do not leave the campgrounds of this
[19:55] facility because something is going to
[19:57] happen when you leave the campgrounds
[20:00] people think well I can just sneak out I
[20:02] can just do this I can just do that and
[20:04] nobody's going to know well guess what
[20:06] word spreads
[20:08] and when word spreads everybody finds
[20:10] out and you know what's going to happen
[20:11] when we find out Whoever has left Kemp
[20:14] you're going to be asked to leave the
[20:16] camp
[20:18] this is something that we are extremely
[20:20] Stern about
[20:22] and we've done it in years gone past we
[20:25] absolutely hate to do it because there's
[20:28] no need for it our desire
[20:31] as counselors and brother Ron's desire
[20:34] and everybody's desire and putting on
[20:36] this camp and working together and doing
[20:38] all these things is not just for fun and
[20:41] for you guys to make friendships yet
[20:43] that is part of it but it's for God to
[20:46] change lives and so the last thing that
[20:49] we want to do is send somebody home
[20:51] because of something that seems pretty
[20:54] silly
[20:55] so please
[20:57] don't try us
[20:59] it's just a fact
[21:02] leave the campgrounds
[21:04] your emergency contact will be called
[21:06] and you will be sent home okay does
[21:09] everybody understand raise your left
[21:10] hand
[21:13] okay excellent very good
[21:15] you're a good class okay cell phone use
[21:19] needs to be kept to a minimal and on
[21:21] silent during service who has a cell
[21:24] phone with them
[21:25] raise your hand
[21:31] somebody did not have their phone on
[21:33] silent
[21:34] okay why do we need to have our cell
[21:37] phones on silent
[21:38] because it disrupts the service and you
[21:41] guys are all saying well we don't have
[21:43] any cell service here anyways so it
[21:45] doesn't really matter well I guess
[21:47] that's a good thing it just played in
[21:48] our part uh do yourself a favor if you
[21:52] got an iPad or you have your phone and
[21:54] you like to do whatever on it you know I
[21:56] don't know what you're going to do with
[21:57] no cell service but hey uh you'll find
[22:00] something I suppose keep it to it keep
[22:02] it in your dorm keep it locked away hey
[22:04] we're here to make friends and
[22:06] relationships that are going to last
[22:08] amen another thing on cell phones uh
[22:12] people have already asked and they said
[22:14] uh can we have the Wi-Fi because we
[22:17] really need Wi-Fi because I really need
[22:19] to call my mom and dad and I really need
[22:21] to tell them that I'm okay listen your
[22:23] mom and dad had confidence in the
[22:25] ministry here that's why they let you
[22:27] come
[22:28] so they know you're okay
[22:31] if there's an emergency or something
[22:33] that happens hey come tell one of your
[22:35] counselors we have your emergency
[22:37] contact info we can give them a call
[22:40] everything will be okay
[22:42] okay
[22:44] okay have we got any boyfriend and
[22:46] girlfriends raise your hand
[22:50] very good very good we got a couple here
[22:52] okay boyfriends and girlfriends uh
[22:55] special friends people who are courting
[22:58] whatever you want to call it hey no
[23:01] holding hands no walking around with
[23:04] each other and holding hands and and all
[23:06] these silly things listen if that
[23:08] special one is that special one that's
[23:09] going to last forever guess what you're
[23:11] gonna have a long time to hold hands and
[23:13] so really for four days there's really
[23:15] no need for it okay
[23:18] um there is a couple of there is a
[23:20] couple of couples here that are engaged
[23:23] already if I could have them stand and
[23:25] we could give them a big old Round of
[23:27] Applause because they deserve it look it
[23:29] that's right yep look at that
[23:34] [Applause]
[23:36] they have attained so if you see them uh
[23:40] together or whatever uh you will
[23:43] understand why and it's because they
[23:46] have kind of already tied the knot but
[23:48] even them we put pressure on them hey be
[23:51] an example before the young people
[23:53] there's no need to be walking around and
[23:55] glued to the hip and holding hands and
[23:57] all that stuff there's a lot of time for
[23:59] that okay next one oh other things uh
[24:03] just stay out of questionable situations
[24:07] you know at night time and when the Sun
[24:10] goes down and all those different things
[24:11] there's really no need for boys and
[24:13] girls to be walking around in the dark
[24:15] by themselves and and around the trees
[24:18] and and all these different things hey
[24:19] hey let's just stay in a group let's
[24:21] just stay together let's just stay in
[24:23] the light because we are children of the
[24:25] light and let's not leave anything up to
[24:28] uh people's imaginations how does that
[24:30] sound isn't that good because people's
[24:33] imaginations can run really wild and
[24:35] come up with something like two plus two
[24:36] equals five
[24:38] when it's not true and you know it's not
[24:40] true but when you put yourselves in
[24:42] questionable situations guess what
[24:44] happens two plus two equals five
[24:46] so let's present prevent that from
[24:48] happening next slide
[24:56] golf carts
[25:00] yeah
[25:01] you guys are so good at reminding me of
[25:03] things excellent okay next one golf
[25:06] carts who here has seen the golf cart
[25:09] raise your hands sure you have who here
[25:12] thinks it's so much fun to ride a golf
[25:14] cart raise your hands sure it is it's a
[25:17] lot of fun but it's fun for the
[25:18] counselors only
[25:22] now we're going to give you guys uh a
[25:25] free ticket here because there's already
[25:28] been a golf cart that was taken possibly
[25:31] two golf carts that was taken and uh
[25:33] boys being boys you know being young and
[25:37] and having absolute zero wisdom
[25:41] that's the nice thing about uh the thing
[25:43] about youth is uh full of zeal and no
[25:46] wisdom
[25:47] so you get 10 guys on this golf cart
[25:48] guess what happens if that thing tumbles
[25:50] over
[25:51] an accident families called things
[25:54] happen which could be prevented if you
[25:56] follow the rules now you didn't know the
[25:59] rules to begin with so we give you a
[26:01] free card give you a free pass
[26:05] now if any of you are seen driving in
[26:09] the golf cart
[26:10] without a counselor whatever it may be
[26:12] guess what it's the exact same thing as
[26:14] leaving camp
[26:16] you will be sent home
[26:18] it's just a fact
[26:19] and it will happen
[26:21] we do not want it to happen
[26:24] because it would be super unnecessary
[26:26] but I know that you guys are you guys
[26:28] are a super nice crowd you're a super
[26:31] nice bunch of young people so I know
[26:33] that you're obedient to your parents and
[26:35] you're going to be obedient to the rules
[26:37] and so we're just asking hey for your
[26:39] own safety for our safety for everybody
[26:42] else's safety and the rules stay off the
[26:45] golf carts
[26:47] what happens if we need it and there's
[26:49] an emergency and you and somebody's
[26:51] clowning around in this thing
[26:53] and then we have to walk 15 minutes from
[26:55] one side of the camp to the other when
[26:57] we could have been there in two
[26:59] so there's always uh things there's a
[27:02] what's it called uh um an action to a
[27:07] reaction there's always there's always
[27:08] reasons
[27:10] so like if you do something silly and
[27:12] something else happens and then hey
[27:13] whose fault is it that we couldn't get
[27:15] there in time
[27:17] I'll let you answer that so under no
[27:19] circumstances and I'll say it with a
[27:21] smile on my face under no circumstances

[49:00] turn with me to the book of First Kings
[49:05] and we'll reach out we'll read uh First
[49:08] Kings 19.
[49:11] verses 9 through 13. thank you musicians
[49:15] God bless you
[49:18] praise the Lord First Kings
[49:21] chapter 19 very familiar portion of
[49:24] scripture
[49:29] we'll read from verse 8. and it says and
[49:31] he arose and did eat and drink and went
[49:33] in the strength of that meat 40 days
[49:36] and 40 nights onto Horeb the Mount of
[49:39] God
[49:40] and he came thither onto a cave and
[49:42] lodged there and behold the word of the
[49:44] Lord came to him talking on the talking
[49:47] about Elijah
[49:49] and he said unto him what doest thou
[49:53] hear
[49:54] Elijah
[49:56] and he said I have been very jealous for
[49:58] the Lord God of hosts for the children
[50:00] of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant
[50:03] thrown down thine altars and slain thy
[50:06] prophets with the sword and I even I
[50:09] only am left and they seek my life to
[50:11] take it away
[50:13] and he said go forth and stand upon the
[50:15] mount before the Lord and behold the
[50:18] Lord passed by and a great and strong
[50:20] wind rent the mountains and break in
[50:24] pieces the Rocks before the Lord
[50:26] but the Lord was not in the Wind
[50:30] and after the wind and earthquake but
[50:33] the Lord was not in the earthquake and
[50:36] after the earthquake of fire but the
[50:38] Lord was not in the fire and after the
[50:40] fire a still small voice
[50:45] and it was so when Elijah heard it that
[50:48] he wrapped his face in his mantle and
[50:50] went out and stood in the entering Inn
[50:53] of the cave notice those other things
[50:56] did not catch Elijah's attention
[50:59] but when he heard that still Small Voice
[51:02] it caused a reaction in his life amen
[51:09] and uh
[51:12] it says there and verse 13 and behold
[51:15] there came a voice unto him and said
[51:18] what doest thou hear
[51:21] Elijah amen you may be seated this
[51:24] evening we trust that the Lord allowed
[51:26] the blessing to the reading of his word
[51:29] I would just like to take a very very
[51:31] simple subject for 15 minutes this
[51:34] evening
[51:36] and I would like to title this
[51:40] what doest thou hear
[51:45] There Was Elijah was a man and there's
[51:49] there was not known much about the
[51:52] history of his life
[51:54] but we know one thing about Elijah and
[51:57] that was that he was a man of God
[51:59] and he was the prophet of the hour and
[52:02] and he held his life as a believer
[52:06] and he held the standard of his life as
[52:09] the standard that a Believer should
[52:11] attain to
[52:13] it didn't matter what Ahab and Jezebel
[52:16] had to say it didn't matter what the
[52:19] politicians of that day had to say of of
[52:22] how we should live our lives and what
[52:25] was acceptable and what was not
[52:27] acceptable for a person to do but he
[52:29] hailed to one thing and that was the
[52:32] word of God now we can take uh an
[52:36] example from Elijah and a day an hour in
[52:40] which so many people are are are
[52:42] bombarding our minds and our lives
[52:45] through the internet and social media
[52:47] and these different inlets and outlets
[52:50] and they're trying to influence us to
[52:53] live our lives in a certain way
[52:57] they're trying to tell us that what is
[52:59] acceptable and what is not acceptable
[53:01] they're trying to tell us in their their
[53:04] worldly carnal reasonings what is right
[53:07] and what is wrong there's one thing
[53:10] about the Bible and is that the Bible
[53:12] never changes
[53:14] and so we can take now the Bible as our
[53:17] absolute and if there's any person if
[53:20] there's whether it be somebody at school
[53:22] whether it be a politician it doesn't
[53:25] matter who it may be but if they're
[53:27] trying to preach something to us that is
[53:31] contrary to this scripture we don't have
[53:34] to accept it
[53:37] if they try to show us something of a
[53:39] way that of things that are acceptable
[53:41] and okay in this hour and it doesn't
[53:44] line up with the word of God I want to
[53:46] tell you that it's a lie because outside
[53:49] of the truth there is lies and so if
[53:52] they're trying to bombard us with
[53:54] something that's outside of the word
[53:56] guess what it's a lie
[53:58] so be encouraged just because uh uh it
[54:03] was just like Joshua and Caleb you
[54:05] remember when they went into the
[54:06] Promised Land
[54:07] do you remember how many spies there was
[54:09] that went into the promised land there
[54:11] was twelve but how many came back with a
[54:14] good report there was two so there was
[54:17] two out of 12 that stood upon the
[54:20] promises of God and it just goes to show
[54:22] us that numbers does not matter
[54:25] it doesn't matter if you say well
[54:27] everybody else believes this in such in
[54:29] such a way and and everybody in my
[54:31] school and everybody that I meet is just
[54:33] so contrary to what I believe well it
[54:35] doesn't mean that that is right and we
[54:37] are wrong because of numbers
[54:40] but it's the word of God hallelujah
[54:43] so here was Elijah
[54:46] Elijah was just a man subject to like
[54:48] passion such as you and I Elijah had a
[54:51] temper
[54:52] Elijah had many things that got him
[54:54] riled up that got him agitated that got
[54:58] him aggravated with life have you ever
[55:00] been agitated and aggravated with life
[55:03] ever been agitated with your parents
[55:07] sure probably the same time that they're
[55:09] being agitated with you
[55:13] but it's all part of the journey Elijah
[55:16] was on a journey
[55:19] and his journey was a journey that was
[55:22] the Bible says that the footsteps of the
[55:25] righteous they're ordered of the Lord
[55:28] so if you're a righteous person in here
[55:31] tonight even I will go to as far to say
[55:34] this if you are living unrighteously in
[55:38] your life at this very present time I
[55:41] believe that God LED you here and he
[55:44] brought you here for a purpose
[55:49] you think Well everybody's Believers and
[55:51] everybody says yeah yeah I wonder how
[55:53] many Believers there are amongst us that
[55:55] have never been born again
[55:58] that have never had a true experience
[56:00] with God an anchor in their lives to
[56:02] where they know that they know that they
[56:04] know that their life has been changed
[56:07] you say I'm a Believer but does our
[56:09] lives prove that we are believers
[56:12] so you are on a journey
[56:15] and God has you on a journey and God is
[56:18] leading you into places that you never
[56:20] thought you would ever go
[56:22] perhaps a church camp
[56:27] so God asked Elijah Elijah was on this
[56:30] journey and he and and and brother
[56:32] Branham said he had a mental breakdown
[56:34] does everybody remember brother Brown
[56:36] I'm saying that
[56:38] and the reason for that was he was just
[56:40] going and he was going and he was and he
[56:42] was preaching and and he was calling the
[56:44] uh he would say it's not going to rain
[56:46] for three and a half years and this
[56:48] isn't going to happen and there's so
[56:49] many Supernatural events that was
[56:52] following his life and guess what he got
[56:54] tired and he got weary
[56:56] when a man gets tired and weary it's not
[56:59] the time to kick him under the curb but
[57:02] it's a time to pray for him let me tell
[57:05] you if your mom or your dad or your
[57:07] pastor gets weary in their walk it's not
[57:09] a time to throw stones
[57:12] if the person sitting beside you is
[57:14] tired or weary it's not a time to throw
[57:16] stones it's a time to pray it's a time
[57:20] to encourage it's a time to lift up it's
[57:23] a time to say I know you're having it
[57:25] hard but here let me burn the burden in
[57:27] your life a little bit
[57:30] and so he he went through many mighty
[57:33] trials in his life and and God proved
[57:35] himself time and time again to Elijah
[57:38] but he found himself now in a cave
[57:42] and God said to him Elijah
[57:45] Elijah what are you doing here
[57:50] let me ask you this evening what are you
[57:52] doing here
[57:54] Elijah why are you here at this Youth
[57:57] Camp
[57:58] why are you here this evening why are
[58:01] you here on your journey amen
[58:05] now we find out that there was many
[58:07] things that was trying to catch the
[58:10] attention of the Prophet Elijah
[58:12] there was earthquakes and there was and
[58:15] there was a thunder and there was all
[58:17] these different things but it never
[58:19] fully caught the attention of the
[58:21] Prophet because the prophet knew that on
[58:24] these uh outward experiences and these
[58:27] outward emotions that he can't depend
[58:29] upon them
[58:31] yeah there's thundering yeah there's
[58:33] these different things yeah it's
[58:34] happening all around me but I'm still
[58:37] not completely captivated with it yet I
[58:40] hear it but it hasn't got my attention
[58:42] just quite yet
[58:44] brother Branham said in the sermon what
[58:46] what do a style here Elijah he said oh
[58:49] how America would have fallen for that
[58:52] he said because Americans they love
[58:54] noise
[58:56] oh they love the great conventions they
[58:59] love the great youth meetings they love
[59:00] the presence of God they love all these
[59:03] different emotions and things that that
[59:05] that comes along with a a a a a a move
[59:08] of God but yet
[59:11] he's seen those things but he wasn't
[59:13] captivated by it enough to go and check
[59:16] it out now brother Branham said America
[59:18] they love these things but Elijah wasn't
[59:22] impressed by those things
[59:25] what doest thou here
[59:28] Elijah
[59:30] why are you here
[59:32] what's your purpose for being here
[59:35] did you come here just to make friends
[59:38] did you come here because you were told
[59:40] to come here
[59:42] did you come here because it's a cool
[59:44] thing to do
[59:46] what was your reason for coming to elf
[59:49] camp
[59:50] what do us now here Elijah
[59:53] what's the intentions that's upon your
[59:55] heart
[59:56] what's the reasonings what's the motives
[59:58] what's what what is what what was it
[1:00:00] that drawed you to this camp this year
[1:00:03] because it's a thing to do
[1:00:06] too many young people are living Youth
[1:00:08] Camp to Youth Camp
[1:00:10] and they go to a youth camp and they say
[1:00:12] oh well praise the Lord I I felt the
[1:00:14] presence of God and it was so good and
[1:00:16] it was so wonderful and oh my I just
[1:00:19] can't contain it but then when they
[1:00:21] leave the camp
[1:00:22] what happens
[1:00:25] what happens when you go back to your
[1:00:27] home that's beginning to crumble and
[1:00:29] break apart
[1:00:32] as all those feel-good things and and
[1:00:34] and and that tingly presence that you
[1:00:36] felt in the crying is that going to hold
[1:00:38] you at that time
[1:00:42] what happens when you go home and you
[1:00:44] fall back into the same uh the same
[1:00:46] cycle that you were living in before you
[1:00:48] came to camp
[1:00:51] is the earthquake going to keep you
[1:00:54] is the fire going to keep you are these
[1:00:56] things going to keep you
[1:00:59] or is it
[1:01:00] is it the still
[1:01:04] understand we are descendants
[1:01:07] of Elijah
[1:01:10] we are a part of the Elijah Ministry
[1:01:14] and Elijah was teaching us that hey
[1:01:16] these sayings are okay but yet that's
[1:01:20] not what we're depending upon
[1:01:22] because the earthquakes will go
[1:01:25] it'll go somewhere else the Thunder
[1:01:27] it'll Thunder somewhere else but guess
[1:01:29] what the still small voice of God will
[1:01:33] never leave you
[1:01:36] so it's the still Small Voice was the
[1:01:39] thing that had captivated the thoughts
[1:01:42] of Elijah
[1:01:45] understand where we're running to and
[1:01:48] fro and we're and we're looking for
[1:01:50] something
[1:01:51] I want to ask you why are you here
[1:01:55] and when you come here what are you
[1:01:57] looking for
[1:01:59] what is it that you're wanting to see
[1:02:03] what is it that you're wanting to hear
[1:02:05] what is it that you're wanting to happen
[1:02:09] what does it mean when the fire of God
[1:02:12] Falls in a service
[1:02:16] does it mean that we get all excited
[1:02:18] doesn't mean that we run around and do
[1:02:20] all these different things hey if that's
[1:02:22] how God leads somebody hey that's good
[1:02:25] the only thing that you can be as honest
[1:02:27] between you and God
[1:02:30] but what happens is one person does it
[1:02:31] and everybody else starts to do it
[1:02:34] well who's the real one and who's not
[1:02:38] so what happens now is
[1:02:40] it was that still small voice
[1:02:43] that captivated Elijah why are you here
[1:02:47] and what are you wanting to see
[1:02:49] I feel like we have we have been
[1:02:52] conditioned that uh in order for a
[1:02:56] church service to be a a really good on
[1:02:59] a really Dynamic service that there's
[1:03:02] got to be a whole lot of noise
[1:03:04] brother Branham said that God is in The
[1:03:07] Quiet Things
[1:03:09] go listen to the sermon what do us thou
[1:03:11] hear Elijah he said have you ever heard
[1:03:13] the sunrise
[1:03:16] have you ever heard the grass grow
[1:03:19] have you ever heard the sunset have you
[1:03:22] ever heard these things we haven't heard
[1:03:24] at one time but yet it's so powerful
[1:03:26] it's our source of life but yet there's
[1:03:29] no noise behind it
[1:03:32] you talk about a natural thing being a
[1:03:34] type of the spiritual
[1:03:36] he says we're we're conditioned that we
[1:03:38] want them we're looking for these things
[1:03:40] but let me ask you what happens when
[1:03:43] those things don't happen in our service
[1:03:48] do you think it's not a good church
[1:03:49] service
[1:03:53] well I didn't feel anything
[1:03:56] and I didn't see anything and I came to
[1:03:59] see this and it didn't happen and I went
[1:04:00] to see that and that didn't happen and
[1:04:02] well let me just tell you yeah it was
[1:04:04] okay
[1:04:05] we've been conditioned to hear the
[1:04:08] outside noise and attractions
[1:04:11] but the voice of God is still it is
[1:04:15] small
[1:04:20] and when that voice
[1:04:22] speaks
[1:04:24] to the True believer's Heart
[1:04:27] there's an attraction to it
[1:04:30] there's something that happens it causes
[1:04:32] a reaction in your life
[1:04:35] oh my
[1:04:36] this guy whispered the whole time
[1:04:39] but yet something happened within my
[1:04:43] heart
[1:04:44] something changed I don't understand it
[1:04:47] it was a service like I've I've never
[1:04:50] been in before it seemed everybody was
[1:04:52] so quiet and there was nothing that was
[1:04:54] really happening and this guy he was
[1:04:56] just whispering but yet this still small
[1:05:00] voice of God it spoke to my heart and it
[1:05:03] changed my life
[1:05:06] the voice of God is what attracts the
[1:05:09] believer
[1:05:11] the voice of God Is What It attracts the
[1:05:15] believer
[1:05:16] that he goes out of his cave and he
[1:05:18] wonders Lord
[1:05:19] where are you
[1:05:23] why are you here
[1:05:27] and what are you Desiring to see
[1:05:31] what are you Desiring to happen
[1:05:34] what are you Desiring to take place
[1:05:38] the reason why you should be here is
[1:05:40] because you want to have an experience
[1:05:42] with God
[1:05:44] you want something to happen because no
[1:05:46] doubt there's things in your life and
[1:05:49] there's things in my life because we are
[1:05:51] human beings and we are carnal there's
[1:05:53] things that really get you down
[1:05:57] there's things that really bother you
[1:06:00] why am I like that
[1:06:02] why do I react like that why does this
[1:06:04] happen in my life why why why I just
[1:06:07] want this to be taken away from me
[1:06:11] I wonder by the preaching of the word
[1:06:13] would you accept it that it was taken
[1:06:15] away from you
[1:06:17] well I didn't feel anything I didn't see
[1:06:19] anything nothing happened but all I know
[1:06:22] is my goodness something has changed in
[1:06:25] my life
[1:06:27] now if you came here and you're looking
[1:06:29] for a girlfriend you're looking for a
[1:06:30] boyfriend you're looking for all these
[1:06:31] different things I pray as the sermons
[1:06:34] go on
[1:06:35] and and brother Burley begins to preach
[1:06:37] and the word of God and the inspiration
[1:06:39] I trust that this this that the reason
[1:06:43] why you came here if it wasn't for the
[1:06:45] word of God and having a closer
[1:06:47] relationship with God that it will
[1:06:49] change
[1:06:51] you say yeah I came for carnal reasons
[1:06:55] sure I did I came because it's cool it
[1:06:58] came for this reason but there's
[1:07:00] something that's happening on My
[1:07:02] reasonings is changing to something
[1:07:05] spiritual
[1:07:07] that my life would change and God would
[1:07:10] take me another level higher than what I
[1:07:14] was when I came here
[1:07:18] what is it that does it
[1:07:21] it's still
[1:07:22] it's quiet
[1:07:25] he's like a dove
[1:07:29] it's like a sheep
[1:07:31] quiet make
[1:07:34] sensitive
[1:07:36] you know that you don't heard you don't
[1:07:38] you don't treat sheep like you do with
[1:07:40] cattle
[1:07:43] you treat Cattle Man you get a big old
[1:07:45] stick and you just beat them all day
[1:07:47] ah get in here
[1:07:51] yeah but with a sheep
[1:07:52] you know how a sheep is rounded into his
[1:07:55] pen
[1:07:56] let's buy a sheepdog
[1:07:59] you know why sometimes God has to let
[1:08:01] Satan loosen your life
[1:08:03] because he loves you and he's trying to
[1:08:06] round you up to bring you in with the
[1:08:08] rest of the sheep to bring you into the
[1:08:10] fold because where there is numbers as a
[1:08:13] sheep
[1:08:15] that's where there's safety
[1:08:18] what do us down here Elijah
[1:08:22] why are you here
[1:08:26] what's your reasonings for yeah I know
[1:08:28] you're on a journey
[1:08:30] we're all on a journey
[1:08:32] the wonderful thing about a journey is
[1:08:34] everybody's journey is different
[1:08:37] everybody's experience on that journey
[1:08:39] is different
[1:08:42] and so it is as Sons and Daughters of
[1:08:45] God I I want you to understand that each
[1:08:48] and every one of you are are an
[1:08:49] individual and God deals with us as
[1:08:52] Gentiles as individuals
[1:08:55] and so the journey that God will take
[1:08:58] you on and the experience that God will
[1:09:00] give you will be different than the
[1:09:03] experience and the journey that he has
[1:09:05] taken somebody else
[1:09:06] so therefore you cannot live your life
[1:09:09] on somebody else's experience
[1:09:13] but it's got to be your own personal
[1:09:16] experience and whatever happens in that
[1:09:19] experience it is true to you between you
[1:09:23] and God and nobody can take it away from
[1:09:26] you
[1:09:27] that's why it's important for us as
[1:09:30] ministers not to just say well well this
[1:09:33] is what happened me and this is what
[1:09:35] happened and if you come in the same the
[1:09:37] same way that I did guess what God will
[1:09:39] do something the exact same thing for
[1:09:41] you and he'll change your life just like
[1:09:42] you did mine
[1:09:45] what's wrong with that there's nothing
[1:09:46] wrong with that but guess what now
[1:09:48] you're all going to want to act like me
[1:09:51] and trust me you don't want to act like
[1:09:54] me just ask my wife
[1:09:56] she lives with me 24 7.
[1:10:00] and so it's important for you
[1:10:03] to recognize the still small voice
[1:10:06] as there's many voices and many noises
[1:10:08] and many different things and louder you
[1:10:10] see that's trying to catch our attention
[1:10:13] social media the internet the cell phone
[1:10:16] all these different things friends at
[1:10:17] school trying to be cool trying to do
[1:10:19] this and not trying to make more money
[1:10:21] whatever you want to whatever you want
[1:10:23] to put it as Satan has got a lot of
[1:10:26] noise in your life and he's trying to
[1:10:28] catch your attention
[1:10:30] but God has also got a voice as a
[1:10:33] musician's come I'll bring this to a
[1:10:34] close God also
[1:10:37] has got a voice and that voice is still
[1:10:40] the voice is quiet
[1:10:42] that voice is Meek and that voice is
[1:10:45] lonely
[1:10:46] it is the sweetest voice that I ever did
[1:10:49] here
[1:10:51] and when he speaks it's so sweet
[1:10:55] but yet it has an authority
[1:10:59] so let me encourage you this evening
[1:11:02] as we spend our time throughout this
[1:11:04] Youth Camp
[1:11:07] and we do different activities and we do
[1:11:09] different things and
[1:11:10] and whatever it may be I want to I want
[1:11:13] to encourage you to get alone with God
[1:11:19] foreign
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:24] well you're not going to hear it by a
[1:11:26] bunch of shouting
[1:11:27] you're not going to hear it by all this
[1:11:29] noise that you surround yourself with
[1:11:31] you're not going to hear it when you're
[1:11:33] playing volleyball that's for sure
[1:11:35] when we play the activities tomorrow on
[1:11:38] the field guess what chances are of you
[1:11:40] hearing the voice of God are extremely
[1:11:44] extremely Slim
[1:11:48] unless God convicts you of your
[1:11:51] carnality and playing sports because we
[1:11:53] all know that Sports brings out the best
[1:11:55] and the worst in every person
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:11:58] it'll bring out our pride it'll bring
[1:12:01] out this it'll it'll bring out our our
[1:12:03] attitude of being a sorry loser
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:09] my team didn't win yeah Sports brings it
[1:12:12] out really good
[1:12:14] how are you going to hear that still
[1:12:16] small voice
[1:12:18] first of all you're going to hear it by
[1:12:20] getting along with God
[1:12:22] you're going to hear it by getting along
[1:12:25] with God
[1:12:27] and spending five minutes in prayer
[1:12:31] because when you start with five minutes
[1:12:33] in prayer it'll turn to Six Minutes in
[1:12:35] prayer the next time
[1:12:36] and it'll go from six minutes to prayer
[1:12:38] to seven minutes of prayer to the next
[1:12:40] time and what you do when you're done
[1:12:42] praying what happens you read the word
[1:12:43] and you say father your word is your
[1:12:47] voice
[1:12:48] your word is your life your word is the
[1:12:51] things that have been written in your
[1:12:53] mind Lord this is this is God in word
[1:12:55] form so if you want to hear from God how
[1:12:59] can you hear from him read the word
[1:13:03] but it starts by getting alone with God
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:08] no doubt some of you will say well none
[1:13:10] of the other boys are doing it
[1:13:13] here's what all the other boys are doing
[1:13:16] none of the other girls are doing it
[1:13:18] they'll they'll just think that I'm uh
[1:13:20] think I'm righteous and all
[1:13:22] self-righteous and all these different
[1:13:23] things who cares what other people think
[1:13:26] when you're making a step toward God
[1:13:34] that when we have our free time and the
[1:13:37] activities are over
[1:13:39] that when we go for a walk we see this
[1:13:41] person sitting under a tree
[1:13:43] spending time with God and praying for
[1:13:45] the service
[1:13:46] and we walk a little further and we say
[1:13:48] wow look at this one there's two
[1:13:51] there's three
[1:13:54] what's wrong with these kids I'll tell
[1:13:55] you what's wrong with them they're
[1:13:57] getting right with God they're
[1:13:58] sensitizing their heart because they
[1:14:00] have a desire that they want to hear
[1:14:03] this still small voice of God
[1:14:09] but you have to play your part
[1:14:12] you have to make the first step
[1:14:15] you have to be swallow your pride
[1:14:18] because the Bible says a man that does
[1:14:20] not pray he's prideful in his spirit
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:28] swallow your pride
[1:14:31] I'm with God
[1:14:33] I don't care if it's only five minutes
[1:14:36] I could venture to say
[1:14:38] that it was five minutes
[1:14:41] more than the previous day that you
[1:14:43] spent with God
[1:14:46] and then before service guess what
[1:14:48] you're in here 30 minutes early
[1:14:50] not at seven o'clock when the when the
[1:14:53] musicians start not at seven o'clock
[1:14:55] when we get up here and we and we give
[1:14:57] our our daily schedule no
[1:15:00] 30 minutes early why because we're
[1:15:03] sensitizing ourselves why am I
[1:15:05] sensitizing my heart because I have a
[1:15:08] desire
[1:15:09] that I want to hear the voice of God so
[1:15:15] if You'll Play Your Part if you'll
[1:15:18] humble yourself if you'll take time out
[1:15:21] of your day God will take time to spend
[1:15:24] with you
[1:15:25] and don't come before God with some
[1:15:28] preconceived ideas no just come with god
[1:15:30] with an with an open heart and say Lord
[1:15:33] whatever happens happens whatever you do
[1:15:36] you do whatever you don't do Lord you
[1:15:39] don't do it but I'm just expecting you
[1:15:41] to do something in my life and guess
[1:15:43] what brother Branham taught us he said
[1:15:45] when you expect something from God that
[1:15:49] God will meet the expectations of your
[1:15:52] heart that's so untrusting I'm trying to
[1:15:55] encourage you
[1:15:57] I'll do it with you
[1:16:00] how many of you guys would want to do
[1:16:02] this
[1:16:04] what time is the devotion in the morning
[1:16:07] seven
[1:16:09] many of you guys would like to get up at

[1:16:15] you see over out here where they have
[1:16:17] all this wood that they're going to burn

[1:16:23] something else
[1:16:26] I'm gonna be there 6 30 tomorrow morning

[1:16:36] teaching ain't none of this stuff
[1:16:38] brother Brandon said you do that when

[1:17:06] your spiritual life let's see if it
[1:17:07] softens your heart let's see if it
[1:17:09] softens your spirit you're saying
[1:17:11] brother Stephen uh you're really putting
[1:17:12] yourself out there because I know that
[1:17:14] God is Not mocked
[1:17:16] and I know that whatever you sow to
[1:17:18] that's what you're going to read it's a
[1:17:21] law of God just like gravity
[1:17:23] throw something up it's gonna come down
[1:17:25] you reap something to God that's what
[1:17:27] you're good you sow something to God
[1:17:29] that's what you're going to reap from
[1:17:32] God and so I know
[1:17:34] because it's a law of God
[1:17:36] I won't make you raise your hand to see
[1:17:39] if you'll join me or not
[1:17:43] but I'll be there
[1:17:46] whether I'm there with you or whether

[1:18:09] you can't just be carnal and expect
[1:18:11] something from God but there's something
[1:18:13] spiritual in our lives or something that
[1:18:15] we have to take a step towards God to do
[1:18:18] and when we do it God will meet us there

[1:19:58] one of you that have taken the time to
[1:20:01] come and be here with us and I'm just
[1:20:03] under great expectation
[1:20:05] that God is going to do something you
[1:20:08] can take people and you can entertain
[1:20:10] them and you can have fun and all of
[1:20:12] that and look young people like to do
[1:20:14] young people things that's great
[1:20:17] but the main thing is that God might
[1:20:21] through a couple of these services do
[1:20:24] something in your heart that'll change
[1:20:27] you
[1:20:28] forever God bless you brother Burley
[1:20:30] come here my friend

[1:20:45] praise the Lord
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:49] it certainly is good to be here
[1:20:52] we thank God for his grace and mercy how
[1:20:54] many you enjoyed the word
[1:20:57] it's very important
[1:21:00] you come to hear the still small voice
[1:21:02] of God
[1:21:04] where God can speak directly to you
[1:21:06] those things are very very important
[1:21:09] uh my name is burley Williams uh some I
[1:21:13] see some familiar faces we're from now
[1:21:16] South Carolina
[1:21:17] and uh a long way from here but we thank
[1:21:21] God for being here it's different Heat
[1:21:25] just terrible heat up here
[1:21:28] I'm like wow this is when I stepped out
[1:21:32] to church last night time I stepped out
[1:21:34] the door I said this is just insane
[1:21:36] the heat but
[1:21:38] there's a Hollow Place than this we
[1:21:41] don't want to go
[1:21:43] is that right
[1:21:45] so we're just thankful to be here and uh
[1:21:48] to share the word of God with you
[1:21:51] my myself
[1:21:53] I wish when uh I was you guys age I
[1:21:56] would have had somebody to preach to me
[1:21:58] I didn't
[1:21:59] I come straight from the streets I come
[1:22:03] into the message
[1:22:04] where the message come to me when I was
[1:22:07] 24 years old
[1:22:08] straight from the street no denomination
[1:22:11] no church life nothing
[1:22:13] and I'm so glad God called me that way
[1:22:15] because he didn't have to get the
[1:22:16] denomination out of me
[1:22:18] but he had to get sin out of me
[1:22:21] so you young people you're privileged
[1:22:24] to grow up in the message
[1:22:27] but you're more of a privilege the
[1:22:28] message coming you
[1:22:32] um I'd like to encourage you with all of
[1:22:34] the when the brother was ministering
[1:22:36] about different voices
[1:22:38] there's so many different voices today
[1:22:41] like the prophet said there are Church
[1:22:42] voices their political voices they're
[1:22:45] all kind of voices and there's nothing
[1:22:47] but a bunch of distractions
[1:22:49] but I'll say this to you uh I'm the type
[1:22:53] of person I believe in the power of the
[1:22:55] Holy Spirit
[1:22:57] I believe God is a keeper
[1:23:00] can we say Amen
[1:23:02] the Bible tells us that grieve's not the
[1:23:05] holy spirit for there until you're
[1:23:06] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:23:10] I'm so thankful that God did not call us
[1:23:13] to fix our problems he want to fix them
[1:23:17] God want to take care of our problems
[1:23:19] that's what gives him the glory when you
[1:23:22] know he is the one that changed you you
[1:23:24] did not change yourself
[1:23:28] um I'm just thankful to be here to share
[1:23:30] the words of life with you share the
[1:23:32] gospel with you and I always get all
[1:23:35] excited when I have an opportunity to
[1:23:38] speak to the young people
[1:23:39] because it's very important
[1:23:42] the first Exodus
[1:23:44] we see what the enemy tried to do
[1:23:47] kill the young people
[1:23:49] second Exodus the same pattern
[1:23:52] get the young people through heroin from
[1:23:54] pharaoh to Heron so we're in the Third
[1:23:56] Exodus what you think the enemy got in
[1:23:59] his mind
[1:24:00] to get the younger generation the cycle
[1:24:02] don't change the patterns don't change
[1:24:05] but I want to say something to you and
[1:24:08] uh I'm trying my best to be quick
[1:24:12] brother and sisters we wrestle not
[1:24:14] against
[1:24:15] flesh and blood
[1:24:18] but Powers Spirits principalities
[1:24:22] the devil is real
[1:24:24] he's a deceiver he comes so many
[1:24:27] different ways
[1:24:28] but I'm here to let you know also God is
[1:24:31] real
[1:24:33] Jimmy say praise the Lord
[1:24:36] I want to say something to you and
[1:24:39] and I trust that your
[1:24:41] applied to your heart
[1:24:45] how many of you ever read a story
[1:24:47] uh brother Brandon talk about a little
[1:24:49] girl lost her mind
[1:24:51] and she kept talking about I know Johnny
[1:24:53] loves me I know Johnny loves me how many
[1:24:56] of you are familiar with that story
[1:25:00] okay not many of you
[1:25:02] but if you get a chance
[1:25:05] look in the message type up I know
[1:25:08] Johnny loves me
[1:25:09] just punch it into it's going to come up
[1:25:12] in a message I think it's come follow me
[1:25:15] that's what that mess is going to come
[1:25:17] up
[1:25:18] if you get a chance listen to that and
[1:25:21] I'm just going to share something brief
[1:25:23] because that's one of the most important
[1:25:25] it's a very important lesson in that
[1:25:28] message to me
[1:25:31] in that message
[1:25:33] it was a young girl
[1:25:35] a boy had promised her to marry her and
[1:25:38] all sorts of things
[1:25:40] and then he broke it off
[1:25:42] but when he broke it off with her she
[1:25:45] actually lost her mind
[1:25:47] because it was a shock
[1:25:49] and she kept saying I know Johnny loves
[1:25:51] me I know Johnny loves me and yet he had
[1:25:54] went and married another girl
[1:25:57] and blamed his father for his decision
[1:26:00] this young girl was I can't remember how
[1:26:03] old brother Brandon said she was she had
[1:26:05] a heart problem
[1:26:06] she came to the prayer line and God
[1:26:09] touched her and and healed her heart
[1:26:12] he said but this time she got a
[1:26:14] different heart problem
[1:26:16] it's a spiritual heart problem
[1:26:19] so when he began to talk to this girl
[1:26:22] she kept saying I know Johnny loves me I
[1:26:24] know Johnny loves me
[1:26:26] and she came into the presence of the
[1:26:29] prophet
[1:26:31] he began to talk to her
[1:26:33] when he begins to talk to her
[1:26:35] a vision came
[1:26:38] and when the vision came he told that
[1:26:41] girl something that her some transaction
[1:26:44] took place with her between her and that
[1:26:46] boy and she he said she knew nobody
[1:26:49] could have known it so God showed a
[1:26:51] vision
[1:26:53] and when God showed that vision and he
[1:26:55] told that girl what they did
[1:26:58] he said he said this to her
[1:27:01] he said
[1:27:04] why are you coming out of this little
[1:27:06] world because it shook her when he made
[1:27:08] the statement
[1:27:09] he said now I got you out of that little
[1:27:12] world he said I want to punch you to
[1:27:14] Calvary
[1:27:16] what that girl had did I want you to
[1:27:19] listen to it yourself
[1:27:21] he said what that girl had did because
[1:27:23] of what that boy had done to her she
[1:27:27] created a world
[1:27:29] and she lived in it
[1:27:32] and she could say Johnny I know Johnny
[1:27:34] loves me I know Johnny loves me she
[1:27:37] created that world
[1:27:39] and then the prophet says this you and I
[1:27:42] when you were born again believer you
[1:27:44] have the power inside of you to go
[1:27:46] create a world
[1:27:47] and you can go live on him he said if it
[1:27:50] wasn't a law to stop that we would do
[1:27:52] that
[1:27:53] how many of you believe that
[1:27:56] yeah better here to tell you you have
[1:27:58] the power in you to go create another
[1:28:00] world to live on which is a good one but
[1:28:03] you also can create a wrong world
[1:28:06] and live in it
[1:28:10] you see the things that you do every day
[1:28:12] the things you partake of the music you
[1:28:15] listen to moves and things you watch it
[1:28:17] creates a world around you and you can
[1:28:19] get spirits on you and you'll start
[1:28:21] living in them
[1:28:24] here's the thing I pray to God
[1:28:27] when but a Brandon told that girl she
[1:28:29] snapped out of that little world he said
[1:28:31] now look toward Carrie it took prophetic
[1:28:35] a prophetic thing to take place to make
[1:28:37] her snap out of that world
[1:28:39] so my prayer is that God would bless
[1:28:41] this Camp so much that the anointing of
[1:28:44] the word could come if you don't got
[1:28:45] yourself trapped in some wrong worlds
[1:28:49] that when you let God just come in your
[1:28:51] heart you can snap out of those worlds
[1:28:52] and look towards Calvary
[1:28:55] because it's very easy to create them
[1:28:59] you can create a world
[1:29:01] nobody wants me
[1:29:03] what girl will ever want me what boy
[1:29:06] would ever want me you can create that
[1:29:08] world and go live in it I'm here to tell
[1:29:11] you that somebody wants you
[1:29:13] that's the Lord Jesus Christ he wants
[1:29:16] you
[1:29:17] I say and now listen to my brother pour
[1:29:20] out his heart
[1:29:22] what this Camp is is an investment
[1:29:25] how many of you ever studied the message
[1:29:27] investment
[1:29:29] investment if you in here and finances
[1:29:31] and everything you always when you
[1:29:33] invest in something you want something
[1:29:36] out of it
[1:29:37] right
[1:29:38] so this is an investment
[1:29:40] and we want something out of it what is
[1:29:43] it that we want to see you you here if
[1:29:47] you don't have an experience with God
[1:29:48] you get one before you leave
[1:29:51] but if you hear with an experience with
[1:29:53] God we hope that you can go higher in
[1:29:55] your experiences with God
[1:29:57] because we're in different levels of
[1:29:59] life here sitting here this evening but
[1:30:02] there's one God that can solve all our
[1:30:04] problems and take us to the place you
[1:30:06] want us to be if we let him
[1:30:08] I know you're tired I'm tired I'm
[1:30:11] supposed to be in the bed right now
[1:30:14] the three-hour difference
[1:30:16] but this means more to me than sleep
[1:30:18] than anything
[1:30:20] and I tell you I would listen to The
[1:30:22] Young Brother 35 years old it's a
[1:30:25] blessing to see young people that was
[1:30:27] themselves in Camp now they don't come
[1:30:30] to a place their ministers they can
[1:30:33] preach to you because I'm not getting no
[1:30:35] younger
[1:30:36] but when I could see a young man don't
[1:30:38] gotta hope to God don't got a hope to
[1:30:39] his life he can relate to you a whole
[1:30:42] lot more things than we can that really
[1:30:44] disturbs up my heart so God bless you
[1:30:47] brother
[1:30:48] but young people I'ma tell you I can
[1:30:51] share a long experiences with you
[1:30:53] and some things it just happened
[1:30:56] recently but if I get in that I wind up
[1:30:59] preaching I'm not gonna I was I'm just
[1:31:01] supposed to do an introduction
[1:31:03] but God's presence is here and I can
[1:31:06] feel the poor I really can
[1:31:08] in an atmosphere like this is actually
[1:31:10] very easy to preach
[1:31:12] but I can tell you some things that it
[1:31:14] just happened recently and I'll go over
[1:31:17] some things just be very very careful
[1:31:20] don't try to see how close you can live
[1:31:24] to the world and think you're okay
[1:31:27] I'm telling you it ain't gonna work
[1:31:31] when I come into this message
[1:31:34] at 24 years old
[1:31:36] I never had a desire how close can I be
[1:31:39] to the world and be okay
[1:31:42] my only interest was Lord what do you
[1:31:45] want me to do to stay away from the
[1:31:47] world whatever I need to stay away from
[1:31:49] I'm willing to do it
[1:31:53] so may God bless you I like the theme of
[1:31:56] the camp and I believe uh we'll have
[1:31:58] some wonderful services and pray for me
[1:32:01] and uh may God bless you I'll just leave
[1:32:04] it there brother run
[1:32:08] [Applause]
[1:32:16] praise the Lord okay so we are going to
[1:32:19] go from here and we're going to do our
[1:32:22] Icebreaker sister Larissa here is going
[1:32:25] to give us some instructions
[1:32:28] um that's going to help you along while
[1:32:29] we do our icebreakers so sister Larissa

[1:32:59] object of the game just real briefly
[1:33:01] there are instructions at your table
[1:33:02] with more details that you'll need to
[1:33:04] read together as a team
[1:33:05] but basically the object is to unlock
[1:33:08] one of these boxes right
[1:33:10] and to do that there's going to be
[1:33:12] envelopes with clues in it that you'll
[1:33:14] have to work
