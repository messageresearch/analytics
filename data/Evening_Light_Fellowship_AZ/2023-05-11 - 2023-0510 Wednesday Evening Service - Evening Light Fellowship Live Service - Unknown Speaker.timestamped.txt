[12:28] calloused as the world is a
[12:30] tough place to survive in as we're not
[12:32] of this world but our daily prayer
[12:35] should be God just come Lord
[12:38] brother Ron's been preaching on
[12:39] perfection
[12:41] you know what we can't be perfected
[12:43] without perfect love
[12:44] but truly that's Perfection and you know
[12:46] what I'm not there yet I'm just being
[12:48] very honest I don't know who's had an
[12:50] easy week and Satan took it off and just
[12:52] let you just have an easy week no sir
[12:55] every inch of this ground
[12:57] we're gonna fight for it
[12:59] because God equipped Us by his word

[13:05] brother Warren has turned into requests
[13:07] he says please pray for the family we'll
[13:10] be traveling to Florida this Friday for
[13:11] church meetings
[13:13] they will be back next Thursday any man
[13:15] would pray the Lord just be with them
[13:16] and keep them safe this is from Sister
[13:19] Suzanne since her husband has passed
[13:22] away

[13:45] for
[13:45] for amen Ben Lau turns into request to
[13:48] pray for sister Lori she's not at home
[13:51] not feeling well and then a special
[13:53] unspoken request here for Brother John
[13:55] Lyle God knows the need
[13:58] would lift it before him knowing the
[13:59] Lord is the he makes a way man this is
[14:02] from Sister Molly I believe it's sister
[14:04] Molly Johnson please pray for Sylvester
[14:06] for Maryland the doctors thought her
[14:08] body was rejecting her kidney transplant
[14:11] but they found out it's that the kidney
[14:13] function is down to only 25 percent this
[14:16] is causing issues with her sugar levels
[14:19] and her blood pressure she also
[14:22] has a has had a brain aneurysm she is
[14:25] really needing a miracle she asked me to
[14:28] thank you for your prayers amen thanks
[14:30] in advance
[14:31] knowing that we will do our job and we
[14:33] will hold her before the throne knowing
[14:34] that God is a Waymaker and you know what
[14:37] this just tells me hey the doctors may
[14:39] be they maybe they've reached their end
[14:42] but you know what the Lord that's where
[14:43] he steps in and takes over because he's
[14:45] the only one who can completely restore
[14:47] this sister brother Sylvester whoever it
[14:50] is the Lord knows and he will meet that
[14:51] need amen
[14:53] and I wrote down here Sister Ann
[14:54] lovell's nephew Caleb I'm not sure how
[14:57] old he is he had convulsions this
[14:59] afternoon it was taken into the hospital
[15:01] he is stabilized but we're trusting and
[15:04] asking for prayer that God will give him
[15:06] a full recovery
[15:07] I wanted to mention my father-in-law
[15:09] brother Brian yeski has put his back out
[15:11] he's at home they're streaming I pray
[15:13] the Lord will go and just be as
[15:15] fortunate to touch him and continue to
[15:17] be with brother Neil Mater as he is
[15:19] still healing from his surgeries and
[15:21] he's going to enter the phase of you

[15:41] been put on his life and I believe every
[15:43] day he's just a little bit closer to his
[15:45] complete deliverance
[15:46] I'm going to continue to remember also

[15:50] exactly what all surgeries he's having
[15:52] or you know where he's at in his
[15:55] his healing

[15:59] and I believe God is going to restore
[16:01] him 100 so let's sing this a lot of
[16:03] needs but you know what we serve a big
[16:05] God
[16:06] amen there's not one of these needs he
[16:08] didn't know about before the foundation
[16:10] of the world and he he gave it he
[16:12] equipped us to speak the language it's
[16:14] the language of his word and it's a
[16:16] Living Word and we don't speak our words
[16:18] but we speak the words of life because

[17:55] [Applause]
[18:04] could I just give a testimony also if
[18:06] you haven't heard probably where that
[18:08] we're just two weeks ago we were at
[18:09] brother Gustav and sister Anita's in
[18:11] Germany and
[18:13] mayor Elise McGarry's parents there in
[18:15] Germany and he had just the day before
[18:17] had a biopsyonic growth on his neck and
[18:19] but they were so hospitable and so nice
[18:22] to us while we were there and I'm sure
[18:25] on their mind was this this you know
[18:27] whether it be cancer or and it was a
[18:30] cancerous but just as I understand today
[18:33] they've determined that it has not
[18:35] spread anywhere else it's very localized
[18:37] here and it's it's treatable and so
[18:40] we're very thankful for that report for
[18:42] brother Gustav there in Germany thank
[18:45] the Lord shall we bow our heads Heavenly
[18:48] Father
[18:49] we're thankful for this time in the
[18:52] middle of a busy week to come together
[18:55] and to quieten ourselves in thy presence
[18:57] Lord
[18:59] we're so glad
[19:01] have a hiding place and that's in the
[19:04] Jesus Christ and we're so glad to be
[19:07] separated from the world and the chaos
[19:09] of this Satan's Eden that's amongst us
[19:11] and about us Lord
[19:13] so thankful to be a separated people
[19:16] Lord many needs had been mentioned
[19:19] across this desk tonight and
[19:21] so many very serious ones and
[19:23] Lord but as our brother said we serve a
[19:26] big God and
[19:27] Lord there's not a sparrow falls to the
[19:29] ground but what you know it so you are
[19:31] so aware of each one of these these are
[19:33] your children Lord and nothing comes our
[19:36] way lest first it passes through thy
[19:38] hand
[19:39] so Lord we have confidence that you're
[19:42] undertaking for each one of these needs
[19:44] and we bring them before you as we've
[19:46] been taught to do and place them at thy
[19:48] Throne of Mercy Lord
[19:50] we thank you now again we ask thy
[19:54] blessings upon the service in each part
[19:56] upon your children gathered here Lord we

[34:06] after his commissioning and he knew he
[34:07] was the seventh angel messenger he asked
[34:09] the Lord he said forgive me God for he'd
[34:11] lean on this gift and even in the name
[34:13] of doing something for the Lord
[34:15] which is the right reason for any
[34:17] Christian the prophet and his Humanity
[34:19] would still lean on the gift
[34:21] God show him a vision he repented he
[34:23] said God forgive me you still give me a
[34:25] vision and still got talked out of doing
[34:27] it
[34:28] think about that friends now you know
[34:30] why brother Ron's preaching on our
[34:32] perfection
[34:33] because we're really hard on ourselves
[34:35] but the moral of that story was the
[34:37] prophet says God is a gentleman he's not
[34:40] shoving no one through a door he's not
[34:42] forcing our hand on anything and his
[34:44] program is paralyzed if we can't be his
[34:46] hands and feet do you believe that yes

[38:26] thank you musicians and uh I'll be
[38:29] traveling here next Monday I'll be going
[38:33] back to Ireland to to see my parents and
[38:37] so I appreciate your prayers for
[38:39] traveling mercies and I just keep my mom
[38:42] in your prayers also uh having a hard
[38:45] time with her health there and stuff and
[38:47] um you know the worst thing about being
[38:49] sick is waiting on a diagnosis
[38:53] so she's been waiting since January for
[38:57] them to try and figure out what's going
[38:58] on and uh uh you know you got Dr Google
[39:02] where you can look up symptoms and
[39:04] everything like that and uh kind of
[39:07] makes you think the worst so that's why
[39:09] I've kind of held back and saying you
[39:11] know what it is because we really don't
[39:13] know so it is not a a goodbye trip
[39:18] I am not going to Ireland to say goodbye
[39:21] to my mom
[39:23] I'm going to encourage her to encourage
[39:25] my dad to lift them up to pray for them
[39:29] that's all we can do isn't it so we
[39:32] covet your prayers and I know my parents
[39:34] do also so Psalm chapter 22 and verse 7.
[39:40] and it says uh
[39:43] uh all they that see me laugh me to
[39:45] scorn
[39:46] they shoot out the lip they shake the
[39:49] head saying he trusted on the Lord that
[39:52] he would deliver him
[39:53] let him deliver him seeing he delighted
[39:56] in him but Thou Art he that took me out
[40:00] of the womb thou didst make me hope when
[40:03] I was upon my mother's breasts I was
[40:06] cast upon thee from the womb Thou Art my
[40:09] God from my mother's belly be not far
[40:11] from me for trouble is near
[40:14] for there is none to help
[40:16] there's only one place that we can go in
[40:18] a time of need and that's God
[40:21] many bulls have come past me strong
[40:24] Bulls of Bastion have beset me round
[40:26] they gaped upon me with their mouths as
[40:29] a
[40:31] ravening and a roaring lion I am poured
[40:34] out like water and all my bones are out
[40:36] of joint my heart is like Wax it is
[40:39] melted and melted in the midst of my
[40:42] bowels my strength is dried up like a
[40:45] pot shirt and my tongue Cleaves to my
[40:47] jaws and now has brought me into the
[40:50] dust of death for dogs have come past me
[40:52] the Assembly of the wicked have enclosed
[40:55] me they pierce my hands and my feet I
[40:58] may tell all my bones they look and
[41:01] stare upon me
[41:02] they part my garments among them and
[41:05] cast lots upon my vesture
[41:07] be not thou Far From Me O Lord my
[41:11] strength Hasty to help me
[41:14] amen Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6.
[41:18] and we know that that scripture there is
[41:21] is a prophecy
[41:24] of the sufferings of Christ
[41:29] Philippians chapter one
[41:33] and verse 6 it says being confident of
[41:37] this very thing
[41:39] that he which hath begun a good work in
[41:41] you will perform it until the day of
[41:45] Jesus Christ amen you may take your
[41:47] seats this evening
[41:50] being confident of this very thing
[41:55] not confident in our own abilities not
[41:58] confident in what we have to offer or
[42:01] anything that we can do be being
[42:03] confident in this one thing that God
[42:06] will perform
[42:09] it until the day of Jesus Christ God has
[42:13] begun the work and God is going to
[42:16] finish the work that he has begun
[42:20] amen I would like to title my sermon
[42:22] this evening it is finished with the
[42:26] subject of God always finishes what he
[42:29] has started
[42:31] God is not like you and I where he
[42:34] starts uh a honeydew here and there and
[42:37] and he never gets around to finishing it
[42:40] he hasn't a bunch of things that are
[42:42] left undone like like us or perhaps I'm
[42:46] the only one that's like that around the
[42:49] house it it seems like I I get a bit of
[42:52] encouragement and a little bit of
[42:53] enthusiasm and and I'll get to that
[42:56] honeydew list and I'll start five of
[42:58] them and I won't finish one of them
[43:00] and so but God is not like that when God
[43:03] starts something he always finishes it
[43:06] and that's where our hope and our
[43:09] confidence lays is that if God started
[43:12] something in our lives if God started
[43:15] something in the lives of our children
[43:17] our family members our loved ones or
[43:20] whatever it may be we know for a fact
[43:23] that God is going to finish that work he
[43:26] is not a quick start he is not one that
[43:29] does something haphazardly but he is a
[43:32] God that finishes finishes everything
[43:34] that he starts you say well brother
[43:37] Stephen uh I can see a bunch of things
[43:40] in my life and I haven't gotten a
[43:42] complete deliverance yet just hold on
[43:44] because if God has started the
[43:47] Deliverance if God has started the
[43:49] healing in our lives God is going to
[43:52] finish it what a confidence that we can
[43:54] have in a God Like That
[43:59] Hallelujah
[44:01] so when we look back into Genesis which
[44:03] is the first book of the Bible we see
[44:06] that God began something
[44:09] and we can call it he began creating and
[44:13] so we find out that the Bible says that
[44:16] God created the heavens and the Earth
[44:19] and there was a period
[44:23] geologists and people who study rock
[44:25] formations they say that the Earth is
[44:28] millions of years old and they'll they
[44:31] get paid a lot of money and they and
[44:33] they take this rock and they'll find
[44:34] this bone and they'll find these these
[44:37] this artifacts of of history and they'll
[44:40] come up with these numbers and they'll
[44:41] say well well this rock is is 10 million
[44:44] years old and this is this one is this
[44:47] many years old and this one is this many
[44:49] years old and the critics they they try
[44:51] to take this information and they try to
[44:55] disprove God's word by their science
[44:58] which is kind of funny they've been
[45:00] trying to do that since the beginning of
[45:03] time and still they can't disprove God's
[45:06] word
[45:08] because they say well the Bible says
[45:11] isn't that how Satan likes to work he
[45:13] likes to try to use the word and say
[45:17] well uh didn't Satan take Jesus up onto
[45:20] a high mountain one time and say well
[45:22] the it is written that if if you if you
[45:25] if you fall uh you know you won't get
[45:28] hurt you'll not Dash your foot off a
[45:30] rock what is he doing he's he's using
[45:33] the word but we can you can't combat the
[45:36] word by the word
[45:38] but Jesus did
[45:40] he said it is also written
[45:45] so Satan tries to come at us sometimes
[45:47] and and you think wow well it's the word
[45:50] and I don't see what happens is when we
[45:53] don't have a full understanding
[45:57] of the word
[45:58] the word will never contradict the word
[46:03] right but when it seems like there's a
[46:06] contradiction within the word it's
[46:08] because of the lack of our understanding
[46:12] and so I say God help us with our
[46:15] understanding this evening
[46:21] I need to relax myself a little bit
[46:25] a little nervous
[46:26] would you be nervous if you were up here
[46:29] [Laughter]
[46:31] bless you foreign
[46:35] so we find out that these uh
[46:39] archaeologists and these different uh
[46:41] geologists and different people they
[46:43] they take these formations and they try
[46:46] to disprove God's word but the Bible
[46:49] says and brother Branham taught us very
[46:51] clearly that in the beginning was the
[46:53] word the word is with God and the Word
[46:55] was God and we find out that when he
[46:58] began to create the heavens and the
[47:01] Earth he created the heavens and the
[47:03] Earth and there was a period now brother
[47:05] Branham said that every seed laid within
[47:09] the Earth at that time
[47:11] he said but it might have taken x amount
[47:14] of years for this seed to come forth but
[47:17] yet
[47:18] it still came forth
[47:22] how long was it brother Stephen how long
[47:25] did it take we don't know
[47:34] in verse 2 it says that the Earth was
[47:37] without form
[47:38] and it was void and darkness was upon
[47:41] the face of the deep
[47:45] this Earth it was without form it was
[47:47] void it was it was shapeless
[47:51] have no real purpose
[47:53] for anything it was in a place of
[47:56] Darkness it was form of life
[48:00] it was it was void of life it was void
[48:04] of light
[48:06] it was an empty place it was a wasteless
[48:09] place it was it would seem that the
[48:12] Earth at this time within the scriptures
[48:14] wasn't worth anything it wasn't good for
[48:18] anything it was it was full of Darkness
[48:20] it was it had it was void of everything
[48:22] that that that would seem uh uh that
[48:27] that it could have been of use for
[48:32] it was just a dark chaos of nothing
[48:35] but then God said let there be light and
[48:37] we realized that there was light
[48:41] and so we could say within ourselves
[48:45] at one point in my life I was as the
[48:48] Earth was in Genesis 1.
[48:51] this Earth
[48:53] I was void of life I was living in
[48:56] darkness I was I was wasteless I was a I
[49:00] was a sinner I was a person that was of
[49:02] of an unclean nature it seemed that I
[49:05] was void of anything good at odd no
[49:08] direction I was just turned upside down
[49:12] and it seems like everything we touched
[49:15] nothing would work out this Earth that
[49:18] was void it was void of something
[49:21] what was it void of it wasn't void or
[49:24] empty of the things of the world but it
[49:26] was void of the word of God
[49:28] but when God spoke to our hearts and he
[49:32] said let there be light there was
[49:34] something that changed in our lives this
[49:38] Earth that was once void and seemed
[49:40] useless now started to change it now
[49:43] started to turn around because where
[49:45] there is light there is life Hallelujah
[49:52] you see before a seed can germinate it
[49:56] must first have life in it because
[49:59] brother Branham said that the seed
[50:01] already laid within the Earth but now
[50:05] when he began to say let there be light
[50:08] that sunlight now began to germinate the
[50:12] life that laid within the seed that was
[50:15] laying within the Earth and so when God
[50:18] speaks to our hearts and he says let
[50:21] there be light that seed that was
[50:23] already in this earth though it was
[50:26] overshadowed and it was clouded by
[50:29] darkness and the filth of this world
[50:31] when God spoke to our hearts when God
[50:35] said let there be life in that seed that
[50:38] I've predestinated before the
[50:40] foundations of the world there was no
[50:42] Darkness there was no emptiness there
[50:46] was nothing that was uh covering the
[50:49] seed that could prevent it from coming
[50:51] to life
[50:54] why because when God says something it
[50:58] must come to pass
[51:03] now before a seed can germinate it must
[51:07] first have life laying within it
[51:12] the seed before it can bring forth life
[51:15] it first has got to rot now that's why
[51:18] Jesus said he who comes to me they must
[51:21] come and die we must die to ourselves we
[51:25] must die to our flesh why because
[51:27] something has got to rot in order for
[51:30] the life of God to come and make itself
[51:33] manifest in our lives
[51:38] when a seed begins to grow
[51:41] we find out that its roots begin to dig
[51:44] down deep
[51:46] and when the root of a seed begins to
[51:48] push down there's only one place that
[51:52] that seed can grow and that's upwards
[51:56] when the seed is in the ground there's
[51:59] only the only friends that this seat has
[52:01] are a bunch of animals of the dark a
[52:06] worm or a slug or a snail something
[52:09] dirty that's laying within the dirt but
[52:12] when they're seated it begins to look
[52:14] around at the beginning it thinks well
[52:16] that's who I am also
[52:20] because you're a you are who you
[52:22] associate with
[52:24] but all of a sudden when life begins to
[52:27] take forth and something happens in the
[52:29] G the seed germinates there's only one
[52:32] place where we can look and that's
[52:34] upward and so now we find that when a
[52:37] seed begins to grow it grows past the
[52:40] Slugs and the snails and the filth
[52:42] that's within the ground because there's
[52:44] something that's pulling the seed higher
[52:48] because there's a warmth that's coming
[52:50] from the Sun and it's drawing the life
[52:53] out of the seed because there's
[52:55] something that lays within the seed that
[52:58] must be manifested
[53:00] so it is with a son or a daughter of God
[53:02] we might have been out and influenced by
[53:06] people of the world and influenced by
[53:07] the different ones at school and work
[53:09] but when God spoke to our hearts and the
[53:12] warmth of the son began to draw us up
[53:15] higher we begin to say I don't need
[53:18] these things in my life anymore I don't
[53:21] need these people in my life anymore I
[53:23] don't need to watch those movies I don't
[53:25] need to listen to that kind of music why
[53:28] because there's something that's drawing
[53:30] me higher
[53:32] at the beginning you don't know what it
[53:34] is you don't understand what it is but
[53:38] all you know is that there's something
[53:40] that's drawing you to a higher place
[53:42] than what you were before
[53:45] it's nothing but the word of God
[53:48] a lot of people like myself you know we
[53:51] uh I wasn't raised in church or anything
[53:54] like that and so when I first went to
[53:56] church my the word of God had such an
[53:59] effect in my life but there's many
[54:01] people that they go to church for years
[54:04] they're raised in a message Church
[54:06] they're raised in a message family but
[54:09] yet their seed has never been germinated
[54:13] just because you go to a message Church
[54:15] it does not mean that you're a believer
[54:19] because you've got to be born again of
[54:21] the spirit of God
[54:26] I really love the
[54:28] ah
[54:30] the thought of the new birth
[54:33] and you say well brother Stephen uh
[54:36] because a lot of people they like to put
[54:37] a timeline on it
[54:39] well at this point yeah I accepted
[54:41] Christ and at this point and at this
[54:43] point and and at this point we try to
[54:45] figure it all out and well brother
[54:47] Branham says it this way at one spot and
[54:50] he says it this way in the one spot and
[54:52] and and and I want to figure out whether
[54:54] I've been truly born again or not your
[54:57] life
[54:58] will be manifested and it'll make it
[55:01] known if you've really been born again
[55:02] or not
[55:04] but just because somebody uh
[55:09] because brother Branham said that you
[55:11] can be justified without being
[55:12] sanctified
[55:14] and you can be Sanctified without having
[55:17] the Holy Ghost so you can believe onto
[55:21] eternal life
[55:23] so because if one person accepts Christ
[55:26] as their Savior and they say a sinner's
[55:29] prayer and their life has changed does
[55:31] that mean that everybody else has to
[55:33] have the same experiences that person
[55:34] had
[55:36] water blood spirit is a birth brother
[55:39] Branham said all three can happen at one
[55:42] time but yet you can be justified
[55:44] without being sanctified
[55:46] you can live a clean life without being
[55:48] born again
[55:51] I just love it
[55:53] the problem is with us we try to make
[55:57] everybody else come through the same
[55:59] steps and process that we came through
[56:01] but because we're individuals God does
[56:04] something different for each one of us
[56:07] and so just because you haven't went
[56:10] through a same experience to a new birth
[56:14] in Christ Jesus as somebody else it
[56:17] doesn't mean that yours is wrong and
[56:19] theirs is right
[56:21] but watch your life
[56:23] watch the manifestation of your life
[56:26] watch the continual growing of your
[56:29] revelation of the word and that'll tell
[56:32] you if you have it or not
[56:35] so don't get caught up with will uh I
[56:37] had an experience with God here and one
[56:39] over here and one over there but
[56:40] somebody said that that wasn't right no
[56:43] you make your calling and your election
[56:45] sure and if you believe that you had an
[56:49] experience with God you hold on to that
[56:52] experience
[56:55] amen
[56:59] we don't want no copycats but we want
[57:02] real genuine Believers in God who are
[57:06] standing Upon A firm foundation that
[57:08] know they've had some kind of experience
[57:12] with the Creator
[57:14] of the heavens and of the Earth
[57:23] a lot of people feel like uh
[57:27] well it was that one sermon when it
[57:30] happened it was that one sermon that
[57:33] that that one preacher preached and and
[57:35] that was the one that was the one that
[57:37] really changed my life there was
[57:40] something that was going on in the heart
[57:42] of your life
[57:45] way before that sermon was ever preached
[57:48] because you might not know it but
[57:51] there's something that's been drawing us
[57:53] and drawing us and it's the holy spirit
[57:55] it's the word of God and so we might not
[57:59] recognize it but when we come to church
[58:01] on a Wednesday night you know what God
[58:04] is doing God is drawing us closer to him
[58:07] he is revealing a little bit more of
[58:10] himself to us through the ministering of
[58:13] the word so it's not just one sermon
[58:15] it's not just one special preacher but
[58:18] it's a continual washing it's a
[58:21] continual drawing and pulling by the
[58:23] Holy Ghost by God himself that brings
[58:26] the change in our lives
[58:29] I say God
[58:31] continue to draw us
[58:34] oh praise the Lord I've been saved I've
[58:37] been born again I I've been adopted into
[58:40] the family but I don't want to just stop
[58:42] there I don't want to just rely on an
[58:45] experience of
[58:46] two years ago but I want to have a
[58:49] continual experience with God I want to
[58:53] have an experience today that I had last
[58:56] week I want God to continually make
[58:59] himself known and real to me
[59:05] too many people
[59:07] live you ever hear Brother Brown I'm
[59:09] talking about living in the glare of
[59:11] another age
[59:12] too many Believers are living in a glare
[59:15] of history in their lives
[59:17] well when I was younger I used to do
[59:20] this and praise God I used to fast and
[59:22] pray well what are we doing now
[59:24] what has God done for us today
[59:29] we can't live in the glare of yesterday
[59:32] but I want to live in a very present
[59:35] experience with God
[59:40] amen
[59:43] so when God spoke to our hearts and he
[59:46] said let there be light we see that God
[59:49] drove back the darkness he drove back
[59:52] the unbelief that we might live and walk
[59:56] in light
[59:58] because where there's light there is
[1:00:00] life and when we're walking in the light
[1:00:03] of the hour we're walking in the life of
[1:00:06] the hour which is Jesus Christ
[1:00:10] amen Fellowship 1956 brother Branham
[1:00:13] said greatest Miracle ever performed
[1:00:16] when God can take something and convert
[1:00:18] it and bring it back to itself again
[1:00:20] just the same as you could take an
[1:00:23] animal by science and drop a little drop
[1:00:25] of water on top of a hog and make it a
[1:00:27] lamb now that's the miracle of it has
[1:00:31] taken uh a hog and putting a drop of
[1:00:35] water on it and changing it into a lamb
[1:00:38] he's saying that's the miracle of being
[1:00:41] born again
[1:00:44] he said that's the miracle of it change
[1:00:46] his whole nature appetites attitudes
[1:00:50] everything that's what God does when he
[1:00:54] saves a man from sin he changes his
[1:00:57] entire makeup he says so no greater
[1:01:00] miracle any part of Divine Healing that
[1:01:03] I've ever seen and I by the grace of God
[1:01:06] I've seen pretty near everything that I
[1:01:08] could ever think of or hear of done by
[1:01:12] our lord Jesus even to raising up the
[1:01:14] dead after they were gone and still I
[1:01:16] think that salvation is the greatest
[1:01:19] miracle
[1:01:22] how many miracles have we seen amongst
[1:01:25] us where God has taken a life and he has
[1:01:28] changed it he has transformed it not by
[1:01:31] uh not by uh conforming people but the
[1:01:35] power of transformation by the word of
[1:01:37] God
[1:01:39] what a miracle it is
[1:01:42] that God can take our desires
[1:01:45] our attitudes
[1:01:47] our carnal nature the things that we
[1:01:50] thought we once loved and now when you
[1:01:53] look at those things you think my
[1:01:54] goodness what a wretched person that I
[1:01:59] was
[1:02:00] you know the changing never stops
[1:02:04] but God's going to continue to change us
[1:02:09] until finally
[1:02:11] this dirty vile wretched body that we
[1:02:14] live in it is going to be changed
[1:02:20] Hallelujah
[1:02:24] what a miracle
[1:02:27] so God said let there be and there it
[1:02:30] was the trees the animals the fowls of
[1:02:33] the air and it kept coming higher and
[1:02:34] higher until there was something in his
[1:02:36] very image
[1:02:37] we find out that on the seventh day God
[1:02:40] ended his work which he had made
[1:02:43] you see God
[1:02:44] always finishes
[1:02:46] what he starts
[1:02:49] he began to create he began to do those
[1:02:52] things he he began to this plan that was
[1:02:54] in his mind he began to unfold it until
[1:02:57] he got to a certain place
[1:02:59] he said I'm done with creation I have
[1:03:02] finished I have started it
[1:03:04] but now I have finished and I'm going to
[1:03:06] take my rest
[1:03:09] so we find out that everything and at
[1:03:12] this time it was perfect everything was
[1:03:15] in harmony there was no sickness no
[1:03:17] there was no growing old there was no
[1:03:20] heartaches it was just a wonderful place
[1:03:22] to be in
[1:03:23] until one day we know the story that Eve
[1:03:26] had a conversation with the serpentine
[1:03:29] he beguiled her we know the story which
[1:03:32] means he seduced her
[1:03:34] with words you know Satan never changes
[1:03:37] his tactics
[1:03:39] if somebody it's kind of hard you know
[1:03:42] if somebody's just giving you all these
[1:03:44] accolades and all these accolades and
[1:03:46] all these accolades oil
[1:03:48] are you trying to seduce us with words
[1:03:51] right now
[1:03:54] I am not a critical person
[1:03:57] but by Nature I'm skeptical
[1:04:01] why why why why do you want to tell me
[1:04:04] I'm so great you're all going to tell me
[1:04:06] afterwards you're the worst
[1:04:08] you couldn't even turn on your mic you
[1:04:11] were stumbling with your words at the
[1:04:12] start you're the worst preacher in the
[1:04:14] LF I'll be thinking praise the Lord
[1:04:18] I won't be critical skeptical
[1:04:24] if Eve just would have been a little
[1:04:26] skeptical and been like hey why are you
[1:04:29] talking to me my husband isn't here
[1:04:32] you've got no business talking to me
[1:04:35] while he's not here things might have
[1:04:37] been a little bit different
[1:04:42] hallelujah it's one of those things
[1:04:44] isn't it
[1:04:46] can you imagine being adamant coming
[1:04:49] home
[1:04:52] and now Eve is trying to seduce Adam
[1:04:56] can you imagine coming home and you're
[1:04:58] finding some other person talking to
[1:05:00] your wife
[1:05:02] trying to partake of this forbidden
[1:05:05] fruit
[1:05:06] you got to be kidding me
[1:05:08] what love he had for his wife
[1:05:12] Maya would disgust us
[1:05:14] you imagine even at the supermarket
[1:05:17] somebody trying to talk to your wife
[1:05:20] I don't know about you but I'm a
[1:05:21] Capricorn
[1:05:23] that would be very hard to deal with
[1:05:27] that's my wife
[1:05:30] he got no business being here get out of
[1:05:33] here
[1:05:34] that's right brother Branham taught us
[1:05:36] he said if if you go to a person's house
[1:05:38] or to a brother's house and and he's not
[1:05:41] there
[1:05:42] and the wife is just there all alone and
[1:05:45] she says well just come on in he he just
[1:05:47] went to get gas in the car and and he'll
[1:05:49] be back any minute now
[1:05:51] what do we do as men
[1:05:53] do we go inside oh that would be
[1:05:56] wonderful give me a cup of coffee and a
[1:05:58] biscuit that would be really nice let's
[1:06:00] sit and have Fellowship
[1:06:03] brother Branham taught us he said no you
[1:06:06] wait in the car
[1:06:07] you go for a drive you go somewhere
[1:06:09] until he comes back because we never put
[1:06:12] ourselves in questionable situations
[1:06:15] and so it is well I might as well just
[1:06:18] go ahead so it is with young people
[1:06:20] I can say it I guess I'm the youth
[1:06:22] leader don't put yourselves in
[1:06:25] questionable situations
[1:06:27] I don't think we should be the youth
[1:06:29] should be riding Alone Together boys and
[1:06:31] girls
[1:06:34] even if there's a complete trust with
[1:06:36] the two of them there's a complete trust
[1:06:38] with the family it's a questionable
[1:06:40] situation and now rumors start oh well
[1:06:44] did you see this then did you see that
[1:06:47] and well what if they didn't get home to
[1:06:49] this time of night
[1:06:52] what happens is now it starts rumors
[1:06:54] that aren't true
[1:06:55] so how do we prevent it from happening
[1:06:58] you prevent the situation from happening
[1:07:07] that's good isn't it
[1:07:10] you know what it does
[1:07:12] kind of preaching it keeps us out of
[1:07:14] trouble
[1:07:18] accidents happen
[1:07:21] people fall
[1:07:23] wrong things happen which should not
[1:07:25] happen but if the situation would have
[1:07:28] been prevented
[1:07:31] things would have been different
[1:07:34] so we shouldn't be lowering the standard
[1:07:38] but we should be keeping it high and we
[1:07:41] should be trying to raise this standard
[1:07:44] he said well we know these things
[1:07:45] brother Stephen we need to be put in
[1:07:47] remembrance of these things
[1:07:50] because
[1:07:52] we have to watch that we get if we get
[1:07:54] too comfortable one with another
[1:08:00] well it's okay
[1:08:02] it's okay for me to do this it's okay to
[1:08:05] wait in the house with her it's fine
[1:08:06] we're we're friends we've been longtime
[1:08:08] friends no it's not
[1:08:11] maybe that's a standard of denomination
[1:08:14] but brother Branham brought us to the
[1:08:16] higher standard in Christ
[1:08:20] to protect us
[1:08:22] to keep us away from these situations in
[1:08:25] our lives
[1:08:26] amen
[1:08:29] now everybody's going to be having a
[1:08:31] hard time getting to the wallaces at the
[1:08:33] weekend
[1:08:35] who am I gonna ride with
[1:08:40] figure it out
[1:08:43] foreign
[1:08:49] so we find out that it seemed that Satan
[1:08:53] had interrupted the plan of God
[1:08:55] but what Satan didn't know was that God
[1:08:58] had other thoughts in his mind that he
[1:09:01] wanted to bring to pass because that's
[1:09:04] what this life is all about really when
[1:09:06] you think about it this
[1:09:08] this life that we live in Christ it is
[1:09:13] all a part of God's Great drama
[1:09:15] and so we might think well why is this
[1:09:18] happening and why does that happen and
[1:09:20] why and why well it happens because it's
[1:09:23] a part of God's plan
[1:09:25] and that we are just actors that are
[1:09:28] acting out our parts in the great drama
[1:09:32] of God
[1:09:34] and so I say father
[1:09:36] let me live my part let me play my part
[1:09:39] and let me play it well
[1:09:45] whatever that may be that you have for
[1:09:47] me
[1:09:49] I believe that sometimes things happen
[1:09:51] in our lives
[1:09:53] and I'll take this example sister joy
[1:09:56] for example sister Joy when she was
[1:09:59] diagnosed with the cancer and she got
[1:10:02] sick and her hair was falling out and
[1:10:05] all these different things
[1:10:07] um I remember so then at that time I
[1:10:10] believe my mom was diagnosed with
[1:10:12] another form of cancer and so but my mom
[1:10:16] would watch sister joy and the things
[1:10:20] that she would post on uh social media
[1:10:23] and she always had a smile on her face
[1:10:26] and she always had uh an air uh Aura of
[1:10:31] uh of of
[1:10:33] of it um what's the word that I'm
[1:10:36] looking for
[1:10:37] positivity
[1:10:39] and there was always something that my
[1:10:41] mom could see through what she was
[1:10:43] posting online and it gives my mom the
[1:10:46] faith to say well if she can be positive
[1:10:48] while going through this situation and
[1:10:51] if God can touch her I believe he can do
[1:10:53] the same for me and so what happens is
[1:10:56] she was playing her part with the
[1:10:59] positive attitude though the
[1:11:01] circumstance was terrible there's
[1:11:03] nothing worse than a sister in this
[1:11:05] message to lose her hair
[1:11:08] but yet look at her life
[1:11:10] look at her hair it all grew back it's
[1:11:13] beautiful why because there was a right
[1:11:16] attitude towards the situation
[1:11:19] and it helped those that were around her
[1:11:22] those that were watching the situation
[1:11:24] and it comforted and it encouraged them
[1:11:27] also
[1:11:29] sometimes God will put us through
[1:11:31] something and I've said it before but
[1:11:33] it's for someone else that they might
[1:11:35] take courage from that same situation
[1:11:40] so God help us to have a good attitude
[1:11:45] because you never know who's watching
[1:11:55] so we find that now God began his great
[1:11:59] Plan of Redemption
[1:12:01] because he had a plan in his mind that
[1:12:04] he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be
[1:12:07] a Healer he wanted to be all these
[1:12:09] different things and and Satan didn't
[1:12:11] know that he was playing right in to the
[1:12:13] plan of God and so now God began to
[1:12:16] speak with Abraham he began to speak
[1:12:20] with Isaac and Jacob and from Jacob onto
[1:12:23] the 12 Patriarchs and we find out that
[1:12:26] what God was now doing he was starting
[1:12:29] to he was starting to fulfill his plan
[1:12:32] of of Israel now becoming a nation
[1:12:37] notice this in the Feast of the trumpets
[1:12:40] brother Branham said now notice now
[1:12:43] exactly that continue uh continuity of
[1:12:46] the scripture exactly the same under the
[1:12:49] seventh trumpet as to Israel the same as
[1:12:52] the seventh seal was to the church we
[1:12:55] find under the seventh seal that when
[1:12:57] these Souls that was under the altar
[1:12:59] there they received robes they were
[1:13:02] given robes not that they earned them
[1:13:04] because they were in the dispensation
[1:13:06] when God was still dealing with Grace
[1:13:09] with the Gentiles not Jews Israel is
[1:13:13] saved as a nation God deals with Israel
[1:13:16] as a nation Gentiles is a people for his
[1:13:19] name not a nation for his name so God
[1:13:23] began with Abraham what was he doing he
[1:13:27] was building a nation for his namesake
[1:13:30] not a people for his namesake but he was
[1:13:33] beginning to get a nation that they
[1:13:35] would serve him that he would be their
[1:13:37] God God that he would be their ruler and
[1:13:40] so he began this work in Abraham and we
[1:13:44] find out in the Book of Revelation that
[1:13:46] he finishes up this work in the
[1:13:49] tribulation period through the 144
[1:13:53] 000. so God now he started in a with
[1:13:57] Abraham and he finishes the work in the
[1:14:00] Book of Revelations
[1:14:02] you see God always finishes what he
[1:14:07] starts
[1:14:13] now from that from we see that God began
[1:14:16] to speak through man from Genesis to
[1:14:19] Malachi foretelling of the Messiah that
[1:14:22] would come and save the people from
[1:14:24] their sins Moses said the Lord your God
[1:14:28] will raise up a prophet likened unto me
[1:14:32] Isaiah 50 verse 6 it says I gave my back
[1:14:36] to the smiters and my cheeks to them
[1:14:39] that plucked off the hair I hid not my
[1:14:42] face from shame and spitting Isaiah 7 14
[1:14:46] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:14:48] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[1:14:51] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:14:54] his name Emmanuel Zach Zachariah 9 verse
[1:14:58] 9 Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion
[1:15:01] shout o daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy
[1:15:04] King cometh unto thee he is just and
[1:15:07] having salvation lowly in writing upon
[1:15:10] an ass and upon a cult the full of an
[1:15:12] ass Malachi 3 verse 1.
[1:15:15] behold I will send my messenger and he
[1:15:18] shall prepare the way before me and the
[1:15:20] Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to
[1:15:22] his Temple even the messenger of the
[1:15:24] Covenant whom he delight and behold he
[1:15:28] shall come saith the Lord of hosts so we
[1:15:31] realize that all these scriptures are
[1:15:33] foretelling of a future event and
[1:15:36] they're foretelling foretelling of a
[1:15:39] messiah that would come he would be
[1:15:41] smitten he would be bruised for our
[1:15:43] iniquities by his stripes we would be
[1:15:45] healed he would be the Messiah he would
[1:15:48] be the one that would come and save his
[1:15:50] people
[1:15:56] so God said that a virgin shall conceive
[1:15:59] in Isaiah and 740 years later it's
[1:16:02] recorded in the Book of Matthew the
[1:16:05] first chapter you see God finished the
[1:16:09] prophecy that he had began through the
[1:16:12] men of old through this new testament
[1:16:15] scriptures
[1:16:17] Now understand that because it doesn't
[1:16:20] happen immediately
[1:16:22] it does not mean that it's not true
[1:16:28] 740 years later they were looking for
[1:16:30] this Messiah but when God speaks
[1:16:33] something it's got to come to pass
[1:16:38] God is not a God who is bound by time
[1:16:42] it is but a split second within his mind
[1:16:46] that his word is fulfilled
[1:16:48] so don't get all caught up well what
[1:16:51] about California and what about these
[1:16:53] different things that was prophesied and
[1:16:55] x amount of years later it hasn't come
[1:16:57] to pass don't worry about it if God
[1:16:59] spoke it it'll come to pass if it's thus
[1:17:03] saith the Lord it cannot not come to
[1:17:06] pass
[1:17:10] so God finished the prophecy of
[1:17:12] Zechariah 9 9 and Matthew 21 1-7
[1:17:17] and what we remember as Palm Sunday
[1:17:22] now we come to the time of the Cross
[1:17:25] there is more scriptures that came to
[1:17:27] pass in the last few hours of his life
[1:17:31] while he was on the cross and throughout
[1:17:33] his entire life talking of Jesus
[1:17:36] what happens when scriptures begin to
[1:17:38] unfold and they begin to come to pass
[1:17:39] guess what it's like a it's like Dave
[1:17:42] Ramsey's Snowball Effect
[1:17:44] it just gets bigger and bigger and
[1:17:47] faster and faster and before you know it
[1:17:49] all these prophecies that we were once
[1:17:50] waiting on guess what they're all
[1:17:52] fulfilled in the
[1:17:54] click of a thumb
[1:18:00] so we find out that when Jesus hung in
[1:18:03] the cross he said
[1:18:04] it is finished
[1:18:06] what was it exactly that was finished it
[1:18:10] was the Plan of Redemption was complete
[1:18:13] God had finished what he had started and
[1:18:16] he made a way back to the Tree of Life
[1:18:18] Fellowship had once again been restored
[1:18:21] to man that Adam had once lost so he
[1:18:25] began this work and he began to speak
[1:18:28] through the prophets but there was a
[1:18:30] time now that this work became finished
[1:18:33] because God always finishes what he
[1:18:37] starts
[1:18:42] so we find out that at the cross now
[1:18:45] there was a changing that had happened
[1:18:48] there was a changing of dispensations we
[1:18:52] find that now God turned from the Jews
[1:18:55] to the Gentiles and we realized that
[1:18:59] God now began another work where he was
[1:19:04] calling out a bride now
[1:19:06] because he's wanting a fellowship and an
[1:19:09] intimacy that is far closer than what he
[1:19:12] had had before and so now he brings this
[1:19:14] bride and and he brings her out through
[1:19:17] seven Church ages
[1:19:19] from Ephesus to laudiusia we see that he
[1:19:22] sent the messenger and that messenger
[1:19:24] had a message for the elect of that age
[1:19:26] and what was he doing he was calling a
[1:19:29] bride out of a church
[1:19:34] why did he want a bride so he could
[1:19:37] share his secrets with her
[1:19:42] things that had been hidden since the
[1:19:44] foundations of the world guess what this
[1:19:45] bride in this last day
[1:19:48] shared it with her
[1:19:50] shared it with her through the
[1:19:51] revelation of the word through the
[1:19:52] opening of the seals and now we can have
[1:19:55] a relationship with God that has never
[1:19:58] had before
[1:20:00] since the beginning of time hardly since
[1:20:02] the fall of Adam why because it is an
[1:20:06] open book
[1:20:07] it is a book that has been revealed
[1:20:09] there has been nothing that has been
[1:20:11] left out
[1:20:13] others in history have probed at this
[1:20:16] book
[1:20:16] they have guessed at it they have
[1:20:18] wandered at it but before our wandering
[1:20:21] eyes guess what God has done he has
[1:20:23] opened this very book before us what
[1:20:25] happens is with us as we get to
[1:20:27] accustomed to it
[1:20:30] I've heard that before
[1:20:32] yeah I know that I've listened to the
[1:20:34] seals I know this horse rider I know
[1:20:36] this yeah yeah I know that
[1:20:39] we get too used to it
[1:20:41] but guess what when brother Brandon was
[1:20:43] preaching these things these things had
[1:20:45] never been taught before
[1:20:49] and I believe
[1:20:51] that the moment we get so arrogant that
[1:20:54] we say ah yeah I've heard that a billion
[1:20:56] times I know that when you become a
[1:20:59] know-it-all you because you don't know
[1:21:01] nothing at all when we become a new it
[1:21:04] all guess what God can't reveal himself
[1:21:05] any more to us because he won't deal
[1:21:07] with an arrogant Spirit like that
[1:21:10] so God help us to stay humble God help
[1:21:14] us to say to stay sincere in heart and
[1:21:17] spirit before him that if he has
[1:21:19] anything else he wants to reveal to us
[1:21:22] that our hearts would be open to receive
[1:21:24] it
[1:21:25] God take away the arrogance out of our
[1:21:28] lives
[1:21:32] happens so much as message believers
[1:21:35] especially when we speak on
[1:21:36] denominations huh
[1:21:40] ah they're all just wrong
[1:21:42] they're wrong
[1:21:43] mystery Babylon
[1:21:45] this and that yeah your spirit is wrong
[1:21:50] what happens if there's someone within
[1:21:52] that denomination that God wants you to
[1:21:55] speak to they'll never listen to an
[1:21:58] arrogant Spirit I'll never have a friend
[1:22:00] outside of the message in another church
[1:22:03] nonsense how are you going to win
[1:22:05] anybody
[1:22:11] well we get so arrogant
[1:22:14] we get so caught up in our own little
[1:22:16] selves well everything's wrong and this
[1:22:18] is wrong and
[1:22:19] I've heard
[1:22:20] people preach before and you know and
[1:22:23] and all the only Revelation that they
[1:22:26] have of the message
[1:22:27] is that denominations are wrong
[1:22:32] good grief man
[1:22:35] maybe because they're arrogance
[1:22:37] that's why God only reveals a little bit
[1:22:40] to them
[1:22:41] but if they just humble themselves
[1:22:43] there's a lot more to this message than
[1:22:45] the nominations being wrong
[1:22:46] there's a lot more to this message than
[1:22:48] women you know wearing short skirts and
[1:22:50] not cutting her hair this message is a
[1:22:53] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:22:55] himself
[1:22:57] and when we have that relationship with
[1:23:00] God guess what happens
[1:23:03] the arrogance goes away those things the
[1:23:06] immoral dress the bad conduct the things
[1:23:09] that we say that we shouldn't say guess
[1:23:10] what it begins to fade away
[1:23:13] why
[1:23:14] because God is doing a work in our lives
[1:23:17] and our friendship you know what happens
[1:23:19] the closer you get to somebody
[1:23:22] you become more like them
[1:23:25] you ever notice that
[1:23:27] if you come and work with me for a week
[1:23:28] I guarantee you you'll pick up on words
[1:23:30] that I say
[1:23:31] and you'll be saying them in the second
[1:23:33] week
[1:23:35] for a while it was sure oh yeah sure
[1:23:37] sure
[1:23:39] and you don't realize it until somebody
[1:23:41] tells you hey you say sure a lot don't
[1:23:44] you sure
[1:23:46] yep sure do
[1:23:49] why is it because the more time that you
[1:23:52] spend with somebody that's why they say
[1:23:53] the longer that a man and a woman is
[1:23:55] married the more alike they become they
[1:23:59] even start to look alike why because
[1:24:01] they're they're they've spent so much
[1:24:03] time with each other that they become
[1:24:06] one with one another
[1:24:08] she finishes his sentence she he knows
[1:24:11] exactly what she likes to buy and on and
[1:24:14] on and on why because their relationship
[1:24:16] is close so it is with us and God
[1:24:20] the closer that we get with God the more
[1:24:23] that we read his word the more light
[1:24:26] that has shown in our hearts guess what
[1:24:28] the more of God we become and the more
[1:24:30] of God we begin to project
[1:24:35] how do I become one with God get in
[1:24:39] Christ spend time with them spend time
[1:24:41] in his word
[1:24:44] amen if the musicians come
[1:24:46] we'll bring this to a close
[1:24:52] so we find out that God began to pull a
[1:24:55] bride in the first church age of the
[1:24:57] Gentiles
[1:24:59] and God finishes with the Gentile
[1:25:01] dispensation when the last one comes
[1:25:04] into the body
[1:25:06] and takes their position within that
[1:25:09] body then the Rapture takes place
[1:25:13] see God started with the Gentiles at the
[1:25:16] time of the cross
[1:25:18] and God finishes up with the Gentiles
[1:25:21] when the last one takes their position
[1:25:22] within the body you see God always
[1:25:27] finishes what he started
[1:25:31] so what about you and I
[1:25:34] let's bring it down home
[1:25:36] so much of the time we
[1:25:39] we think well I don't know what the
[1:25:41] future holds and I don't know about this
[1:25:43] and
[1:25:44] my loved ones
[1:25:46] sick children sick family members
[1:25:49] whatever it may be
[1:25:52] Lord I don't know how it's going to end
[1:25:54] just rest assured in this one thing if
[1:25:58] God has started a work in your life
[1:26:02] we've seen it throughout the scripture
[1:26:05] God is going to finish it
[1:26:08] if God had started a healing within the
[1:26:13] the body of one of your children or
[1:26:15] whatever it may be little Theo little
[1:26:18] Josiah guess what what God the healing
[1:26:21] that God has started he is going to
[1:26:24] finish it because God always finishes
[1:26:29] what he starts
[1:26:31] he's not out here like us and he is a
[1:26:34] bunch of half done things around no no
[1:26:36] no no
[1:26:37] that's not how God works so we ought to
[1:26:40] have confidence tonight in God and in
[1:26:44] his word we have seen this pattern
[1:26:46] throughout the scripture simple sermon
[1:26:49] tonight I I fell over my words I oh
[1:26:52] whatever
[1:26:54] it was human
[1:26:57] because humans have mistakes
[1:27:01] I don't pay no attention to that look at
[1:27:04] the thought throughout the scripture
[1:27:06] look at the pattern and the examples
[1:27:09] because there's scriptural examples are
[1:27:12] given to us that we might follow the
[1:27:15] pattern to see what God done there that
[1:27:18] he'll do it again here so if he started
[1:27:21] something throughout the scripture and
[1:27:23] he never and he always finishes it he'll
[1:27:26] do the same for us as Believers in our
[1:27:29] lives
[1:27:30] therefore there's nothing to worry about
[1:27:35] there's nothing to worry about well what
[1:27:38] happens or what if that doesn't happen
[1:27:41] being confident of this very thing
[1:27:44] this very thing
[1:27:46] that he who began this work
[1:27:50] he is able and he is going to finish it
[1:27:55] when's he going to finish it I don't
[1:27:57] know
[1:27:58] I don't need to know but all I know is
[1:28:01] this thing
[1:28:03] it's finished
[1:28:05] so take confidence tonight and say Lord
[1:28:08] here is my life here is my situations
[1:28:11] here's what I'm going through here's
[1:28:14] what's happening Lord I know that you
[1:28:16] know but I want to tell you anyways I
[1:28:19] want to tell you what's on my heart I
[1:28:21] want to tell you what I'm feeling I I
[1:28:23] want to tell you what I'm going through
[1:28:25] but I know Lord that you begin something
[1:28:28] he began to do something I can see the
[1:28:32] change
[1:28:33] so now I'm expecting you Lord to finish
[1:28:36] it

[1:36:00] a testimony that she'd like to give
[1:36:03] and come on up here
[1:36:08] she said that
[1:36:10] God started a healing in her life and
[1:36:14] and that God finished it
[1:36:17] and that God spoke to her heart and said
[1:36:19] that she should get up and testify
[1:36:25] there's nothing too difficult for God
[1:36:29] well God starts he's always going to
[1:36:31] finish
[1:36:34] take your time Mom
[1:36:36] okay
[1:36:38] a lot nervous my heart's feeding out of
[1:36:40] my chest oh
[1:36:43] about a year and a half ago I went
[1:36:45] through a really hard trial
[1:36:48] um
[1:36:49] I won't get into all the details but I
[1:36:52] was just
[1:36:53] it's a very anxiety
[1:36:57] and the depression wow this is due to
[1:37:00] physical things
[1:37:02] and but I was at a point where
[1:37:04] I thought that was going to be my life
[1:37:07] um I thought I would never get better
[1:37:11] um
[1:37:15] it was pretty bad oh
[1:37:18] we started having thoughts to take my
[1:37:20] life
[1:37:21] so
[1:37:24] put me on my medication which I was
[1:37:26] scared of death to take
[1:37:28] and Stephen you know he said mom don't
[1:37:31] be afraid of medication you gotta have
[1:37:33] faith in it you gotta have faith in
[1:37:34] doctors
[1:37:36] so I did it
[1:37:37] and um
[1:37:39] they started changing
[1:37:42] and
[1:37:43] um
[1:37:44] like a half a year ago I decided you
[1:37:46] know what I'm I want to get off this
[1:37:48] medication I don't want to be tied to it
[1:37:50] so I just started slowly waning waiting
[1:37:53] waning
[1:37:54] anyways now it's been like two and a
[1:37:56] half weeks I haven't been on it at all
[1:37:59] and I feel normal
[1:38:03] um
[1:38:04] I mean
[1:38:06] have my life back I have joy
[1:38:10] in
[1:38:11] I just want this to be
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:18] I pray for her all the time
[1:38:21] she stuck by me when I was going through
[1:38:24] my trial
[1:38:25] and I just want to be there for her
[1:38:28] I have a prayer cloth I actually want
[1:38:30] you to take with you
[1:38:32] um was prayed over
[1:38:34] I believe my brother Branham I would
[1:38:36] like you to pray for her
[1:38:39] but you know just so many people we
[1:38:43] don't understand what we go through in
[1:38:44] the trials
[1:38:46] but people are there that they're put in
[1:38:48] our path to help us sister Joy was there
[1:38:50] for me
[1:38:53] you I looked up to her what she went
[1:38:56] through
[1:38:57] and there's just different sisters that
[1:38:59] just stuck by me so close sister
[1:39:02] modeling sister Lou Payne
[1:39:06] oh my goodness so many
[1:39:08] much you know we're a body and we just
[1:39:10] have to stick together and pray for each
[1:39:12] other
[1:39:13] and I don't know if there's somebody out
[1:39:15] there that this can help I pray that it
[1:39:17] does
[1:39:18] but the Lord just brother Ron said a
[1:39:20] long time ago when I thought that I
[1:39:23] would never get better
[1:39:25] I was even afraid just being in church
[1:39:27] the torment was so strong and he said
[1:39:30] you're gonna get up and testify
[1:39:36] I'm sorry he was
[1:39:38] sorry he wasn't here but the Lord just
[1:39:42] spoke and said the work's been finished
[1:39:52] Hallelujah you have the Lord some praise
[1:39:55] this evening
[1:40:06] now
[1:40:07] if you would have seen my mom sister
[1:40:10] Tracy a year and a half ago you would
[1:40:14] not think that's the same lady
[1:40:18] now to show that when God does something
[1:40:21] he does it perfectly brother Ron
[1:40:23] prophesied he said you're going to
[1:40:26] testify in front of the church at that
[1:40:29] time in her life there was no way
[1:40:32] now to show that God when he does
[1:40:35] something he completes it we just went
[1:40:38] on a vacation last week Ashlyn and I and
[1:40:41] our cousins Olivia and Ethan Strayer we
[1:40:45] got five kids eight years old and

[1:40:49] Tracy took care of them all by herself
[1:40:52] oh wow
[1:40:55] if you know the stress of five little
[1:40:57] kids that would put you back on
[1:41:00] medications
[1:41:03] but here she is testifying
[1:41:07] of the healing Virtues Of Jesus Christ
[1:41:11] showing to us that Jesus Christ is the
[1:41:14] same yesterday today and forever

[1:41:21] testifying that she's been healed the
[1:41:23] work is finished it's been completed
