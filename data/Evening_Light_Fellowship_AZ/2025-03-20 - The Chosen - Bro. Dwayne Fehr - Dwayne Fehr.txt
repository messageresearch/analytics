good to be in the house of the Lord again this evening let you have your seats for a few minutes just want to take a few moments and uh bring greetings from the Saints back at home I actually was asked if we would sing tonight so I probably should just invite my wife while we're so don't run away I know my son-in-law is out there you all know I'm just simple so 44 is not hard to take care of is it garve don't do that they used to you know I have to say this just you know the there there's uh we start young and then we grow and as we grow uh things change in our lives and our hearts change and our desires change and you know when you're I was young once and I heard brother brother Ron talking about you know those guys that go down the street and you know their five cars back and you can feel the boom boom and you're you're thinking what's wrong with my car and but I was once that guy and uh and you know we were I I would come to my mom's place where we go for the weekend and I'd get up Sunday morning and she 'd have instrumental music playing and I would think oh my word mother are you for real and I would tease her I'm like Mom like don't you have something that's got some life in it and and you know and then eventually I found myself um got to the place where I didn't like I mean it's not that I don't like it but there has to be a time for it and and you know and then I would find myself get in the car and I didn't want to hear anybody's voice I just wanted to hear instrumental music and you you know I'm getting to be an old man I I get into my son-in-law used to just give me the hardest time about you know those those old songs and the way we sing them and you realize that he's starting to play and sing a whole lot like that I got into his house the other day and here's my daughter and she's got instrumental music playing and I thought brother are we getting old or are they getting old you know I'm thankful for the stage of life I'm thankful for every stage of life I was I can say this I was young once and I enjoyed it and now I'm old not as old as some but I am old and I'm enjoying it uh you know you think well I'm here I'm a grandpa already and I think but I wouldn't want to go back I wouldn't want to go back I'm happy to be in this stage of life and so anyhow it's good to be here I certainly do appreciate brother Ron opening his Pulpit I didn't come for that I I came to visit my family um but it's always an honor brother Ron always an honor um I'll just say I'm one of those young men that looks to that generation and brother Ron has just been one of those Epistles that um that you can follow that you can look to and you can say you know what that's the road I want to go thank you Lord just like that so God bless [Music] you one dark night in Egypt a fearful time had come for one little Hebrew boy who was his father's firstborn son with the angel of death passing by it was hard to fall fall asleep but one little lamb stood in his mind as he laid there count and Sh he wondered why the young lamb had to die why his blood was on the door [Music] through the wind and rain would it still remain he wanted to be sure so he called out to his Earthly father with a trembling voice so scared crying father will you please look and see if the blood is still there he said Son now don't you worry for the blood is there to stay though the wind May blow the rain may fall why it won't just wash way you know the blood was being the rageing storm it's been applied with loveing care save secure you can rest ass show that the blood is still there looking over the damage Satan's storm had left [Music] behind the flood of endless questions how the doubt had f F my mind oh the fear that gripped my troubl soul brought me back to my knees in prayer crying father will you please look and see if the blood is still there he said Son now door won you worry or the blood is there to stay and though the wind May blow the rain may fall it won't just wash away you know the blood will stand the rageing storm it's been apply with love Loving [Music] Care safe secure you can rest to show that the blood is still there oh yes safe secure you can rest to show that the blood is still there aren't you thankful for that this [Applause] evening Hallelujah I'm so grateful it don't matter what Satan throws at us doesn't matter what kind of storms you got to go through in life listen the blood remains don't matter how many lies he tells you don't matter how deep of a hole he tries to D to drag you into thank you God bless you the blood remains I'm so grateful for that this evening if you got your Bibles with you while you're standing I just want to take the opportunity to thank you uh for keeping little baby Kai in prayer amen uh you know many times we we have the privilege to pray with people and for people and uh you know sometimes you can enter right in and the next time you just do it because you've been asked to do it and we know God answers prayer anyhow but when it hits your home that's when it's part of your family when it's part of the blood stream that you hold all of a sudden something else try takes place I'm so thankful I had calls coming in from the different parts of the country saying brother Dwayne we're praying for your little grandson and I know this little group of people right here this body that loves each other I just want to say thank you I so appreciate it and we're so thankful for what the Lord has done in his life you got your Bibles with you turn over to St John the 15th chapter tonight very familiar scripture certainly have been enjoying the ministry while I've been here brother Warren I appreciated that thought last Wednesday I so appreciated that and and brother Ron God bless you I uh fed my soul on Sunday didn't he say some just isn't you know we can't remember everything but every now and again there's just something that just jumps at you and you can just say thank you Lord thank you Lord and I'm so thankful for St John the 15th chapter 16th verse something that we're all familiar with you have not chosen me I want you to notice the letters here what color oh of course they're not that color up there but what color are they in your Bible for those of you that brought your Bible what color are they in your Bible they're red you've not chosen me but I have chosen you ordained you that you should go go and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain that where whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you amen and if you got your Bibles turn back to the Book of Joshua I hope brother John I hope brother Ron you don't mind but uh we've been in this thought since the beginning of the year and uh I just love to see how the Holy Spirit works and so I'm just going to drop in tonight this is a familiar scripture to us and I believe it's just uh it's eminent for the hour we're living in right now I have not come Joshua chapter 1 Joshua chapter 1 verse 9 have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage let me let me read that again I did you did you all hear that okay now I want you to look at the author the one that wrote it I'll just be the most piece tonight have not I commanded thee I'm not asking for an opinion I'm not asking for what you think have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage and Be not Afraid yeah neither NE neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee hallah for the Lord thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest let's bow our heads one more time father thank you for your word tonight Lord we know your word is life and if you just come now and Quicken it father we'll just be so appreciative we ask these things in Jesus name amen God bless you you can have your seats again this evening I'll take a little been on a little thought at home and um it's uh I kind of stole it from I I can't you know we have to be honest sometimes and I I'm not one that does a whole lot of watching of videos and movies and all that but I hear some of the young people talk sometime and they ask me hey brother Dwayne have you ever watch The Chosen and I'm like well maybe one episode maybe two in all the years that it's been playing or whatever I I haven't seen too many of them I'm not against it probably it's very good but it was the title amen that caught my attention The Chosen because God has a choosing listen when Jesus walked the face of the Earth it was him that chose the disciples that he chose it's always been God's choosing it's not man's choosing it's always been God's choosing and and and so uh my thought is this the Chosen and if we were to look at the scriptures you know we would find the scripture says that you have I you have not chosen him but he has chosen you he has chosen you and ordained you now this church when God makes a choice Len God is not a haphazard God God is not somebody who just you know puts his hand in the Hat and pulls out and says well that should be good enough oh no if God makes a choice it's the right choice if God makes a choice there's a purpose in it there's a reality to it and God's choices are never the wrong choice and so when he said I have chosen you I've ordained you to go that you that you would go and bring forth fruit and so I I've taken my little thought from the beginning of the year at home has been be strong and very courageous because although you might be God's choice his ways are not your ways and the reality that he wants out of your life not might not be the reality that you and I want out of our lives and he knows the path that we must trod to bring the very best to bring the very best listen he's the one that made you everything that is about you everything that there's good about you God put it in you when before you were even born the time that you come to Earth everything good that God wanted out of your life was already in you then but it takes a process to get it out you know I think the gems the the the the value of some of the the D diamonds and the rubies and and and all the valuable rocks the ones that you guys would pay you know tens and thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars for how are they made they're not laying on the surface they're made under great pressure that's what makes them valuable the crushing and everything that goes on that's what makes them valuable I think oh god listen that's what makes you and I valuable to too and so I just take a little thought tonight if I could just get started I was uh I was back at home and and uh you know thinking on the things of the Lord and I opened up my my Bible to the book of Nehemiah and something just shook me and I began to read and it hasn't left me since uh since the beginning of the year so I'm going to you know how this the spirit of the Lord works I'm just going to move right into it and and if you got your Bibles and you want to just turn over the book of Nehemiah the first chapter tonight you'll find that right by behind Ezra the book of Nehemiah chapter one and I I want to I want to read it this way it says the words of Nehemiah the son of ah boy I'm I'm hard at these things aalo um thank you thank you that's what I call Body Ministry thank you and it came to pass in the month of chisu in the 20th year as I was in shushan the palace that Han haniah one of my brethren came and certain men of Judah and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped which were left of the Captivity and concerning Jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the Captivity there in the province are in great Affliction and reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire and it came to pass when I heard these words I sat down and wept and and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of Heaven I just want I I just want us to catch the picture tonight I read this and something came to my heart what hour are we living in church yeah we're living at the End Amen we're living at the end what age I'm talking about the age what age are we living in not the one we've been caught up into what age are we living in lady OFA we're living in lady OFA an age that the scripture said uh you know God would find himself on the outside knocking trying to get back in amen it said it would be it would be an age that would be rich increased with goods and had need of nothing and here we have Nehemiah you know Nehemiah a man of God and he's he he's been in a place of bondage God I just say it this way there's nothing brother R says this there is nothing out of place in a believer's life you can never be out of the will of God we might get out of the perfect will into his permissive will but he will always bring us back and that permissive will will work out for his perfect will and here we have Nehemiah you know he's he's been in bondage as a as a servant as it were all these years but his heart he's listen Nehemiah is a Son of God we take the Old Testament we type it with the New Testament and Nehemiah being a Son of God he's his heart his whole desire back with his people back in his country he's had these questions and now a message comes a messenger finally comes and Nehemiah asks the question hey what is going on at home how are the people of God how how are they fairing back at home and the report comes back the people of God are downtrodden the walls of the city are knocked down the gates are burned they're they're in a bad position and it made me to think this way you know here's here we are is this not the same situation that the age that we're living in found themselves in that literally the people of God were living I I call it this in an altered reality they weren't living the where God wanted them to live they weren't in the position God wanted them in they were living in a in an altered reality and the STIs part about the read when I begin to read this the saddest part to me was this that the children of God had found them themselves in that condition and it had become normal normal wandering around you know burdened down and and the pressures of life and and the Very walls that should have been their protection knock down and they just they just walk by and just let it be on you think God what's wrong with people but I'll say this it will only be that way as long as God will let it be that way the Bible says there's times and seasons for everything and here's God's children you know they're in a they're in a situation that we we can Absolut absolutely look at these scriptures and we find Insight in them I find Insight in them there's a reality here that that that God's ways are not our ways but God's timing is perfect and When God says it's time for something to happen it don't matter what you think it don't matter what you think or how you try to to change it or to avoid it it will happen just the way God desires for it to happen and so we we we we want to be aware of something tonight that that God has never changed his way since time began God always redeems Man by man can I say that again sir God always redeems man through man we're here tonight because of the man Christ Jesus who was more than just a man but he come to walk in our stead man he God became man to redeem man and where many of you sitting here tonight are are the are the uh the expression of of the preaching of the word the heart of a man of God that has stood here somebody reached out to you somebody uh somebody got your attention attention gave you a word somebody witnessed to you and some or lived a life in front of you and it was your life that Drew them to the light God always redeems man through man and so we're sitting here you know God's ways are are absolutely wonderful we look at you know sometimes we look in the scriptures and we find them we think oh man that's so confusing and I don't understand it and you know we used to sing a little song about the wheel that's in the middle of the wheel and and and I think Lord what is that all about but we realize it's not that mysterious it's simply the mind of God the spirit of God what he's doing in the middle of the wheel those little spokes are running and the will of God is being worked out on Earth it's rolling on Earth down through time and the will of God is being worked out uh in that big wheel it's the wheel of God and so we're thankful for that you know we have when I say that the wheel of God keeps moving according to the time of God according to the time of God and you know brother brand would liken uh you know the time of God to our like we are like to a watch and how that every little piece had to be in the right position so it would keep the right time I'm saying that because I'm getting somewhere tonight because we're a body we're a body and God needs you to be in your place so that when the next clog comes by it catches you just at the right time time and God can use you this is you know Church we're we're I want say this we're a long ways from a one-man Ministry anymore we're a long ways from a one-man Ministry I know people don't like to hear that but it's a reality all that Christ was all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church what is it a many membered body God's working through Hallelujah all right Thessalonians says this but of the times and Seasons bre you have no need that I write unto you for you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night is that true there's times and seasons for everything there's times and seasons for everything and we find that in the book of Nehemiah we find these people living in a condition that is so troubling I don't you know God God when God listen when God created Adam in the beginning did he not create Adam in a perfect in a perfect condition did he not actually make Adam god of the earth amen absolutely he made Adam god of the earth what was God's purpose when he created man in his own image he would make you and brother Ron touched on it Kings and Priests that would be Kings to rule and Reign Over there's got to be a Dominion God gave you a spiritual Dominion to Reign over top of principalities and powers and and the spirits of of darkness and evil God made you a king to rule over those things he made you a priest to intercede for one another and stand in the Gap God made you to be those things and that's what Adam was in the beginning he was all that God was it was poured into a man there he stood just in the likeness of God and absolutely ruling and reigning on the earth and then sin came in totally destroyed the picture and and it's been God's purpose to bring men from where fell from back to can we say Amen to that the condition they fell from back to so I you know we find in the in the book of nemiah you got to you're going to have to bear with me tonight you it's hard when you've had you know months of putting you know just keeps going and going and just going to try and push it all into a little spot tonight but but but we find people living with a victim type of mentality I can't and know I you know the doctor told me the the reports says that I've got you know I've got 101 days to live and and if I do live I'm going to be this and and if I you know the doctor now tells me I've got diabetes and if I and if it keeps going I'm going to lose my leg and I'm going to lose this listen whose report are you going to believe tonight whose report are you going to believe tonight listen you can walk around well you know it runs in the family it ran in the family until you said that's enough until you said that's enough listen God has already there has been blood that's been shed stries have been born and the healing the healing virtues already been sent forth and it's yours if you'll stand on it the thing is Satan is going to Buffet you day and night day and night day and night until he can wear you out and you'll finally say well I guess that's the way it is here's God's children living in a condition where their homes are broken and and everything that they that they sought they believed and they you know where's this God that we believe where is he at I'll tell you something he's alive and he's here tonight he's alive and he's here tonight he's not just the god of yesterday and he's not just the god of tomorrow he is here and he's now in he's we're in his presence even now Hallelujah you know I I got a little grandson back home and I uh I'm just having the time of my life with these little children you know and and and we had them all over at Christmas time and he wanted to go do something outside and and you know I kept telling him you know I said hey Henry I said just you know Grandpa's talking right now and he come back and Grandpa can we go out and and and finally I said Henry I said you know I looked at my watch I said Henry when the big hand gets to the top I said we'll go out man we talked and talked and all of a sudden he came running into the living room and he said Grandpa the big hands at the top he's four years old he doesn't even know what it means but he knows that when the big hand reaches the top something's going to change and in our lives Church there comes a time when the time clock of God keeps ticking and when the big hand reaches where it's supposed to be something's got to change in our lives it can't remain the same and and so we find that God's people God's people have always been in a condition God allows the you know he allows us the the mountain tops and he allows the valleys and he allows the sun and the snow and and there's life and there's death there's always this you know the contrast God and he's expressing himself in the contrast how can you enjoy good health if you never get sick how can you enjoy uh you know happiness and joy if you've never been uh downtrod and you've never had burdens and weights on your shoulders and finally something breaks and you're free and oh it feels so good and we can rejoice in that but how much more does God love it when things are down and when you're when it looks like there's nothing good and everything looks wrong and you can still lift up your hands and say but I know My Redeemer Lives listen he's not God of our feelings tonight he's a god of his word hallelujah hallelujah you know I think sometimes of job how job got to that place you know he was he was wealthy and and he had everything and he was a he was a well re revered man he was just you know it looked like everything God just blessing him in every part of his life and we know the story so I don't want to go into that but I want to I want to ask asked the question was job any less seed when all of his wealth was gone all of his family was gone all of his health was gone was he any less a seed of God in that condition than he was when he was all you know everything was going good for him no he was still seed listen did it mean that God didn't love him no it didn't mean that God didn't love him did it mean God was you know God had his whip out no it didn't mean that it did it mean that God did it mean that God was still had him on his mind yes you're still on God's mind Hallelujah but his circumstances his Circumstances had robbed him of that that Joy a joy unspeakable had robbed him of of the glory that he that he once had and was it hard for him go read the book yes it was hard for him he got to a place he said man it would have been better if I wasn't even born God it would be better if I wasn't born but what he you know he had this burden on his heart oh if I could oh come on Church you get down in those valleys and if I could just if I could just find his door and go knock on it and just have a conference sit down and talk it over with him oh how glorious it would be that's what job was looking oh if I could just find where he's at but there's times where God doesn't want you to do that he's got something for you in the valley of decision in the valley of hurt and pain he's got something that he's working out in your life that can only come out from that hallelujah hallelujah I'll say this no matter how long or how dark the valley seems and how long it takes there's joy in the morning there's joy in the morning Hallelujah I say one day God give him a seven seal Revelation job where were you can I ask you the question tonight I I can ask it and you can answer it God asked job and job said I don't know but I can ask the question and you can answer because the Revelation has come where were you before the foundation of the world not where were you last week last month last year 10 years ago 40 year not that but where were you before the foundation of the world hallelujah hallelujah second Corinthians says this we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we're TR troubled let me read that again Amen on we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair we're persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed Hallelujah all always bearing a boat in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies Hallelujah for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh hallelujah praise the Lord I think Romans says what can separate us from the love of God what can separate us from the love of God you know shamgar got to a place one time where he found himself living in an altered reality listen he was the son of God he was a Son of God and found himself living in an altered reality cowering and checking to see where's the enemy at and how how long do I have to stay here before before I can go and grab a little corn rush back and beat out the corn and finally get enough to take it to my family shamgar is living listen he's living way below his privileges but one day the clock touch the top one day the hand reached the top and shamgar got a revelation of who he was who he was and from that moment all fear left something overcame him and it didn't matter how big the enemy looked didn't matter what their numbers look like didn't matter how great they bragged some there was something down on the inside of shamgar that wasn't there before let me just say this it took an angel's message to bring that Revelation to him let me tell you something Church it took an angel's message to bring a revelation to you and I of what you are tonight we're not some backseat downtrodden uh uh you know I forgive the saying out back hill billies we are born to be son of Gods we're not here to put on a religious program a religious show we are now the sons of God and this is the hour that all Earth has been groaning and and and waiting on for the sons of God to come into their position Hallelujah When God says it's enough it's enough hallelujah praise the Lord Brother brandom says this I think brother Ron quoted it on Sunday but it's in my notes I'm just going to read it anyhow he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church excuse me and what she stands for hold on let me back that up let me back that up he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church church and what she is and what she is and all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church he poured into the church Lord you know when we have communion lots of times we take that scripture I believe it's out of First Corinthians there and we begin to read it and and you know it says and many are weak and sickly among you because they don't discern the body of the Lord correct correct when Paul was smitten down you know the pillar fire when Paul when he smoked Paul down what was it that that what the spirit of God told Paul Paul Paul why persecutest thou me Jesus had already done been buried uh resurrected and this is and here's Paul making his way you know he's the one that's been persecuting who the church Church of God and the word and the word comes to and says why persecutest thou me where's he at where is he at not somewhere in the yers church he's not somewhere out in the yers he right here you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost God himself dwelling in man again Hallelujah she said what she stands for she can do the Greater Works shall be an invincible Army and if they get the true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless powerless don't tell me you can't overcome tonight if you can't overcome get the Overcomer on the inside you will overcome Hallelujah he says withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as death definitely thed today as when Christ with stod him uh uh at every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we we love it amen with true Revelation in our lives listen church I'm not talking about aead knowledge I'm not talking about just understanding the the Deep mysteries of God and all those wonderful Revelations that but the revelation of God for you and your life and what he wants out of your life Hallelujah when you can step into your position and know that that's what God has for you listen all hell is going to have to stand aside Hallelujah the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it but we will prevail over them hallelujah amen you know I get to I want I want to get back to my thought here in just a moment but but let me just continue on you know we're living in an hour brother talking about the revelation of God you realize that the revelation of God could not come till the lamb took his book come on brother it's the truth is that the truth Revelations chapter 5 he takes the book right Revelations chapter 6 The Seals begin to break yep yeah first the Redeemer first the Redeemer then he begins to expressen Hallelujah Hallelujah all right let me just move on here okay I'm not going to get into this tonight but you know if you go to Revelations chapter 6 and you begin to read the breaking of the seals you find out one thing that every time that a seal breaks what happens war war seal breaks War seal it's a new revelation God begins to express something else begins to unfold something else another part of his being his deity every time that a SE would break War breaks out all right sometimes we just look at the scriptures and we're like well that's for the church ages and but I don't know if we do we understand tonight that that God is no longer dealing in the church ages correct what do I shame on me forgive me for that statement I know you understand that because I know what your pastor preaches amen you absolutely understand that right forgive me for that God is no longer dealing with the church ages it's done it's over yep it's done it's over go back and read the we we get back into the Book of Revelations you find out you know Revelations 1 2 3 there God's dealing Revelation chapter 3 God's dealing through the church ages we see joh John writing out the church ages to the Ephesian age to the uh sman age to the perian age and on and on it goes to the lady oan age and then we find what right yeah he's on the outside right that's right but go to Revelations 41 and what do you get yes sir and he's being told John's being told come up hither he's no longer down in the church age he's calling to somebody to come up higher oh Church come up higher tonight rise and Rise into the presence of God God's calling us to a higher plane he's not calling for us to be bound down and Shackled down and and run away with you know that just directing Our Lives he's calling you come up into my presence I got things I want to show you I got things I want to tell you I want to express to you who you really are hallelujah hallelujah so so when I say these things that every time we we can look at the principle that every time that a seal is broke War breaks out let me just reflect this brother Brown says this in the church H book he says notice what happens here it's the plan the first thing happens announcement in heaven what happens a seal is opened what is that a mystery is unfolded see and when the mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds and does what declares war declares war it declares war a plague Falls and the church ages open what is the war part what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully revealed but when he does he catches the mystery of God then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him Goes Forth to the people and what does uh uh what does he do out there he begins to Proclaim that message that's right what does it start a war a spiritual war all right now we can recognize that in the church ages we can recognize that in the church ages that when God begins to R feels something when he wants to take the church to another level spiritual war breaks out every time we can go back through it all every time but listen those Church ages we can look at them and if you if we could just recognize that God what God did in the church ages he's actually doing in our lives also he's actually doing in our lives also this is not just something that's sitting out there in the ages but you know we are being let me just use this for an illustration tonight this morning or this morning Sunday morning we had my little grandson up here correct am little baby brother Ron you looked on his face you held him you watched this little life move but prior to that prior to that there was nine months there was nine months that he was absolutely concealed you didn't know if it was going to be a boy you didn't know if it was going to be a girl you didn't know if he was going to have black hair red hair white hair you didn't know what he was going to have you didn't know what he's so it's not and then when the when the when the Revelation is made known oh it's a boy and he's got you know brown hair and blue eyes and and oh my but that's not the end right that's not the end that little baby in a little bit of time he begins to express right now he's sitting there cries for what he wants fills his pants you know just whatever he needs to do to get his mom's attention and then in a few short you know maybe three or four years now the nature of what God has made that little creature to be now it starts expressing itself but he's not going to stay a little six-year-old boy or four-year-old boy that's not what God made him for God made him to mature to come to maturity that's right and so it'll be another you know he'll go to school and all of a sudden you still what's he going to do in life I don't know he's four years old he's six years old what's he going to you tell me but God there's a revelation that will be made known if you'll just give it time amen but every time that there's a change there's a war every time there's a change there's a war you take a young man a young girl you know 11 years old 10 years old and in a few short years they've got to they've got to become uh men and women I'll tell you what that little that little ages gets to be so hard the the turmoil that's going in on in their body and and their actions and reactions and brother Brown says you just be patient with them then be patient they'll come through it why because God is going to express more of what he wants want out of their life amen hallelujah all right let me let me just go on here just a little bit I'm trying to find a place let's go back to the Angel's message the Angel's message every time it takes every time God's going to do something it takes a Heavenly sound if God's going to do something special there's a Heavenly sound amen you know when Gideon was cowering behind his little uh his little wine press it took the Angel's message before Gideon caugh the Revelation it took the Angel's me let me let me ask you a question when Gideon caught the Revelation what did he do remember the principle out of the church age book the message sounds the messenger sounds Goes Forth with the message proclaiming the message what happens War breaks out Gideon got the message from the angel Gideon took that message and begin to share it what happened war war breaks out amen all right battles battles are started for victories to be won battles are not started for people to be lost battles are started for victories to be won hallelujah hallelujah let me just take Esther just for a moment Queen Esther you know sometimes we take how many of you knew when you were 10 years old what you were going to be at 40 years old 50 years old you know the whole scripture has been written for our admonition we can look back this young lady she's just a girl growing up who how there we many of us would never have traded places with her she lost her family she always felt like something was missing in her life she had no idea what God had purposed in her life you have no idea what God's got purposed for your life you don't know what tomorrow holds you don't know what doors God's going to open or where he's going to send you or what he's going to do we don't know that neither did Esther neither did Esther Esther had no idea that one day that she was going to be summoned to the king's Palace she had no idea that she would become the king's choice not a not a choice she would be the choice listen Church may I say this tonight you're not one of just many decisions many choices that God has you are his choice you are his decision you are you're the very heartbeat of his life you are what he's you are what he's here what he's his heart is pulsating for hallelujah hallelujah you'd never have guessed her little broken heart when her family uh you know when her parents both died we would never you would never understand that I couldn't understand that you don't know the fear of being taken from your home into a into a king's Palace what's going to happen to me how am I going to be treated we have no idea what it's going to be like but We Know Who Holds Tomorrow Esther had this one assurance that she knew that her God that she served was mindful of her life Hallelujah you know God has plans for you tonight and it's the plans are to prosper you now let me re let me just reflect on that as soon as we say the word Prosper the first thing that comes to our mind is what wealth fact lady OAS God us programmed wealth listen god holds God don't need your money God don't need your bank account God can find a fish wherever he needs a fish he knows where it's at but he does need your life he needs a surrendered life he needs somebody who's willing to give what they got If He blesses your life with finances thank him for it if he doesn't never bless it with finances it don't matter if you got him you got all you need you got all you need I got I got a home on the other side that's being prepared for me I got a you know sometimes we look at homes and we have our dreams and our plans if my plans never came never came uh uh uh uh never came to fruti in this world I got one on the other side that he knows better than I do what I want Hallelujah little Esther she didn't know she didn't know nothing about uh you know about what her life was going to hold but one day she was Queen amen one day she was Queen I'm going say this I'm trying to set something one day she was Queen and she still didn't understand what God had for her life she's in the king's Palace she is the King's wife and now I'm talking to you tonight church cuz we're all saying yeah I believe I'm a Believer I believe God loves me but what does God want from my life what does God want from my life she's in the king's Palace she's enjoying the fellowship of all the of the king's Kingdom she's feeding on on the king's diet she's got the king's the clothes to wear she's got everything but God had a purpose that was yes she was the king's wife but God had a purpose for her yes God's called you yes he's he's put the wedding band of unmar Grace on your on your finger and we rejoice in that but what does God have for you what does God have for you and all the whole time while she was the king's wife do you realize that that purpose that God had for her was still withholding from her think about that it was still withholding from her and all the time Satan was you know he was his plans were to destroy God's children destroy God's children destroy God's children on and it wasn't until one day a message came yeah to remind Esther of who she was Esther I know you're the queen of the Kingdom Esther I know that you're enjoying the Fellowship of the Saints Esther I know you're feeding on Mana Esther I know the die I know your life is good but eser if you don't do something now if you don't express who you really are help is going to come from somewhere else cuz God's ways God will not be defeated oh my oh my what a position to be put in here's the crisis moment a crisis moment Satan is bent on destroying your family bent on destroying the ones you love bent on destroying the things that are around you you're in a crisis moment and the only place listen the only place Esther can go is one place into the king's chamber into the king's chamber and it's w she's in the king's chamber that the king actually makes known the reality of her position as Queen go back and read the story go back yeah she had the clothes she had the nice house she had all the friends the family but it was in the chamber in the king's chamber where it was actually made known to her the reality of the authority of her position Hallelujah when she went to the before the king what' he say Queen Esther all that I have even up to half of it listen God's not separating the kingdom this side is yours this side is mine no no no no no no no in other words all that I have is yours all that I have is yours you just need to speak the word all I've got it's already there what do you need Esther yeah and it was at that moment the reality of why God had placed her on Earth was made known I'll tell you what your position on Earth is more than just going to work your position on Earth is more than just raising kids it's more than just a family it's more than just a church it is a the per position that God has placed you in where's the soul Who's that one you can witness to who's that one that you can bear a burden for who's the one that God's placed in your life brother Neil I was so blessed the other Sunday I come out and he come walking right up shook my hand I'm standing there looking at him thinking brother Neil what's this just said Cain he said brother Dwayne I'm back to work get in my car and drive my car listen Satan cannot keep the children of God down no matter how hard he tries the testimony of brother Neil is greater today than it was 5 years ago 8 years ago the testimony is greater look what God has done hallelujah what happened it took a crisis we don't like to talk about these things nobody wants crisis but let me say this it's in the pressures it's in those hard hard times that God truly makes himself very real to you and now you take that testimony and you go share it with the world Hallelujah Hallelujah brother Brown would say this talking about being the wife of the king talk about being the wife of the king brother Brown would say this there's a question that was that brother Brown was presented with he said would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture did Esther have a Ministry did Esther have a Ministry it was her Ministry that saved her people it was her Ministry that saved her people brother RS asked the question will the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now see the bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour am oh come on church amen we want to say the it's the message of the hour you know what we want to do we want to hold up our our little message book I guess I don't have one down here but we want to hold up our message book or we want to tell you know we want to share them our pictures in our home and listen we love the message but if the message don't become life if it doesn't walk and talk and live it's not the message of God because he said all that Christ was he poured into the church so it would continue what his ministry his ministry sure that's what's going on right now see the bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour it's the bride of Christ sure she is consists of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists p is that right the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great ministry amen the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble well they didn't me they didn't recognize Jesus why would they recognize you they didn't listen the world we had a prophet in in in in our I don't want to say our generation but in our generation in this age God sent a prophet to visit this world and God you brother said he said he had more success in my Ministry than he did in his own Ministry and much the world knows about it yeah so humble so humble listen the only way that we're going to find what the purpose of God is in our lives is to get into the presence of God Amen get into the presence of God Amen when you get into the presence of God something happens yes always where God is something happens always lives get changed you know I was reminded of that the little story of Buddy Robinson I think it was I think it was him anyhow hope I got that right you know he was a uh just a man farmer man whatever uh supposedly a Christian you know we just say he loved the Lord and probably went to church on Sunday and you know but one day you know he was he was out plowing his field with his mule and you know he got to the place I don't know what happened happened with the mule but something went wrong and and and Buddy Robinson lost his cool and I guess he sounded like he had lost his cool a whole lot of times you know I don't I don't think that's be fitting for a Christian if you got a temper why don't you give it to God God will take care of it you know he lost his temper on that mule and he beat that thing and he grabbed it and he bit its ear and he was so angry and then you know he went off to church later that week and I no pardon me if I remember the story right he he the Holy Spirit got him so convicted that he had lost his temper and and and so he started apologizing to The Mule and the mule said if you don't got no more religion than that he's apologizing for what he did he said well if you don't got no more of God in your life than that you you need it and and and I say that respectfully there's a lot of times you know we just we people cover themselves with a blanket of religion right their lives really don't change they just cover themselves with a blanket they speak quotes they they speak scriptures but really their lives don't change just put them under pressure and you see what comes out very good come on you know and finally one day he got off they had the pastor brought in some Ministry and and you know he went to church that night and the Holy Spirit really got a hold of him he went back home you know and whistling thanking the lord and just singing and and he walked in the into his yard he come up on the porch of his house and as soon as he got close the big dog just kind of backed up and he'd been that place before too many boots you know people come home Angry and grumpy and this way that way come on it's pretty quiet in here right now we're all guilty we're all guilty amen and he's like it's okay boy God did something for my life and so the dog you know that night went talked to the rest of them they're like ah we heard this before God did something for me but his life from that moment proved what God had done his life proved what God had done hallelujah my goodness I'm way from far from where I need to be why don't you do me a favor when you go home why don't you read the book of Nehemiah you know you get just looking into scriptures nemiah you'll find out that that talking about the seals being broken here's God's children living in bondage and a message comes to Nehemiah and the burden of God falls on the man now here's a pastor message comes to nemiah and the burden of God falls on the man and the Bible says that he wept he cried he fasted he prayed why because he had heard of the condition of the church back home he heard of the condition and that his heart desired to see them where they ought to be amen a message came to Nehemiah Nehemiah receives the message he calls on God and then he goes before for the king and the King grants him all that he asks for yeah he takes his takes the king's treasury as it were and he heads back to Jerusalem to go and and and see what's going on and and why aren't the people living where they should be living he gets into Jerusalem he doesn't say a word did you say that this Sunday brother Ron if you don't want somebody to know you don't say nothing did you say that on suay he didn't say a word he simply stopped left everything and went and took his T her and then when he went to the people and he began to tell them look around is this how the children of God is this what God desires for our lives yeah is this what God desires did God desire for you to be uh you know to be so burdened down does God desire for the enemy to have preeminence in your life does God desire is that God's desire for us we're children of God Nehemiah gets the message Nehemiah takes the message when Nehemiah begins to preach the message to restore come on church to restore the kingdom the very walls of God the very the very walls that were there to protect him and the gates that should have been there protection the glory of the city it had all crumbled it had all crumbled and when Nehemiah begins to preach the message of what restoration yes amen Nehemiah was preaching a restoration ation message those listen those rocks of Revelation that had once been the walls that protected the children and had fallen down Nehemiah wasn't going to get new rocks he needed to get those rocks back into their position again so they would protect the children of God again and when he began to preach his message what happened go back and find out war God gives him a revelation of restoration he goes to preach the message War and I'll tell you what when the spirit of God comes your pastor might get behind the pulpit and start preaching restoration of your home restoration of your Health Restoration of your life just restoration of Revelation he wants you in a higher position he's calling spirit of God saying come up higher and when you go to moving on that Revelation Hell Breaks Loose as long as you're sitting there doing nothing as long as you don't it's it's you know you're shame on us we get so comfortable we get so comfortable now we got a good church we got a we got a wonderful group of musicians we got good song leaders he got a great pastor we got good fellowship and we're comfortable in that but listen God is calling come up higher come up higher where into my presence into my presence so I can make myself known here's nemiah and he begins to preach his message and immediately the Bible says and the people said uh you know they said we strengthened our hands we're going to work they had a heart to work in other words they were going to do something about their situation listen if you're going to if you're going to move on with God you're going to have to do something God's not going to drag you along he's asking you to follow him Hallelujah you're going to have to do something that's right as soon as they begin to move as soon as they begin to place the revelation of God back in its position again what happens yeah hell breaks light Hell Breaks Loose I forget whose their names all are the horite and the and the ah we'd have to go back into you go back and read it but you find out what is it as soon as the church brother Ron listen to me tonight as soon as the spirit calls for the church to come up higher hell is going to break loose Satan don't want you to move he is he as long as you're satisfied as long as he can keep you complacent and sitting there it's a it's we're all good he's happy but you step into your position what was what was Nehemiah do in the message of Nehemiah was calling for the people of God to come and find their positions go read the third chapter of nemiah you'll find out the Bible says that that the people of God begin to work and this one built from here to here this one built from here to here this one built from I think 30 times this one built from here to here this one what are we talking about a body Ministry a b Nehemiah wasn't the one man that was that was called to put all the blocks back in position but he was the one that was leading the charge he was the one leading the charge you read down through the scriptures and I'll tell you what you read down through the to through the story of Nehemiah now listen to me daddies Nehemiah came to a time where where the enemy had so made made their point and threatened and that Nehemiah said hey I want every man to stand here with a sword in his hand and work with the other hand those that are not working I want you on the walls watching what was it it was a church that was in its position each one looking for the other one watching out for the while watching out for the enemy listen sometimes we you know as pastors sometimes you're the last person in the world to find out anything meanwhile the enemy has been working his way into this home working his way into that place here and there and you only find out about it later you're like well what I I never heard nothing about this but what about you brother what about you sister when you knew about it and did nothing oh it's a pastor's job it's the Deacon's job you got a prayer life you got a sword in your hand you can get before God you got the ability to to call on the name of Jesus and watch the spirit of God you've got the ability don't just lay it all on your pastor don't just lay it all on the deacons it's a body Ministry yes there's an order but it is a body Ministry Church Hallelujah oh God I'm so thankful when when when when my little grandson's sick that I'm getting calls from here and there and and all these different places brother Dwayne we're praying for him that is a body Ministry amen hallelujah amen hallelujah brother Bram says this he says there's been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a real bride there must come one that's not just got the mechanics but the Dynamics Hallelujah it makes the church live and move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift what good does it do to give her a simonize there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has got to be Dynamics to make it work let me say this young man let me say this young woman you might believe the message you might quote the message but if the message isn't living in you you better find a place at the altar somewhere someplace soon where you can get God on the inside so that you can overcome this world Listen the enemy will drag you down into a place that you don't even I'll tell you what I've seen it happen where it drag them right down into a place and they want to take their lives I've had young people in my office and they're talking about taking their lives I've had men call me on on the phone sometimes and say brother Dwayne I'm driving down the road right now I'm in a position right now I'm ready to pull out in front of a semi- just at their wits what is it the pressure of the age they're under such a pressure get God on the inside greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world Listen it says this that's what he proved Hallelujah that Easter proved that he wasn't only the word he was God himself the Dynamics the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff dead in the grave Shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead stars

the moment I he never even looked at me the moment that I seen him something overcame me and I said that man is under so much pressure right now something's crushing him I walked outside and I just waited maybe five minutes went by 10 minutes went by and all a sudden he came out and I stepped out I forgot his name now and I chatting with him I said are you okay he got tears in his eyes he looked at me he said why would you ask I said because I was standing by the door when you came in and something was very wrong amen he broke down in tears right there he said begin to tell me his story I said tell you what why don't we just pray about it God answers prayer what is it God's got legs God's got eyes God's got a voice God's got a heart that he can work through the more we'll give him the
