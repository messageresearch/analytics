[26:22] in the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[26:24] Christ it is a privilege once again to
[26:28] be in the house of the Lord amen uh
[26:31] shall we take our Bibles in the book of
[26:33] first king uh chapter
[26:38] 19 verse 13
[26:59] and it was so when Elijah heard that he
[27:02] was wrapped his face in his mantle and
[27:05] went out and stood in the entering of
[27:08] the cave and behold there came a voice
[27:11] unto him and said what do what Dost thou
[27:15] hear Elijah and he said I have been very
[27:17] jealous of for the Lord God of host
[27:20] because the children of Israel have
[27:23] forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thy
[27:25] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[27:28] sword and I and I only am left and am
[27:33] left and they seek my life uh my life to
[27:37] take it away and the Lord said unto him
[27:40] go return thy way to the Wilderness of
[27:44] Damascus and when thou comest and anoint
[27:48] hael to be king over Syria and jeu the
[27:51] son of Nishi Thou shalt anoint to be
[27:54] king over Israel and Elisha the son of
[27:58] japet of
[28:00] Abola thou shal anoint anoint to be
[28:04] prophet in thy room and it shall come to
[28:07] pass that him that escapethe sword of
[28:11] Asel shall J slay and him that escape
[28:16] from The Sword of J shall Elijah
[28:21] slay may God bless you you may be
[28:25] seated uh once again uh uh greet you all
[28:29] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[28:31] Christ it is uh a privilege to be found
[28:35] in the presence of God looking away unto
[28:40] him uh knowing that
[28:43] uh times are very
[28:46] precious
[28:48] uh we by God's grace we able to uh cramp
[28:53] uh last service most of the things that
[28:56] had to be spoken
[28:58] but by God's grace
[29:01] uh uh you received it very well and
[29:04] giving all the comments by God's grace
[29:08] uh the Lord knows how to lead things and
[29:11] when to take stop and taking turns and
[29:13] stuff because quite often any student of
[29:17] the world knows that when he gets into
[29:19] the water the water gets from the feet
[29:22] to the knees and to the hip and until
[29:25] you start
[29:26] swimming uh it's the never ending yeah
[29:30] it's never ending but by God's grace we
[29:32] believe that each one of us will be able
[29:35] to attend uh to those things as the Lord
[29:39] leads them
[29:41] accordingly uh for tonight I want to uh
[29:45] get started with uh
[29:48] another uh portion of the scripture uh
[29:51] seeing Jesus and his
[29:53] program uh and uh for the subject why
[29:57] Comm
[29:58] humanism we have uh come uh to the word
[30:05] to be able to see Jesus and his program
[30:09] uh as we just sung it there that we are
[30:13] nothing I have
[30:15] nothing uh just like the little baby
[30:18] when um is with the parents he is
[30:22] nothing he can take care of himself he
[30:25] can wipe himself he can get a bath
[30:27] everything every single portion of his
[30:31] life is tied to the father or the mother
[30:35] and uh the this responsible parents have
[30:40] the understanding have the knowledge
[30:42] know exactly the way they should do to
[30:45] lead the
[30:47] child but
[30:49] uh it's not always the case amen when
[30:53] the child start to grow the child start
[30:56] getting all kind of understanding in and
[30:58] knowledge and stuffff then he becomes a
[31:01] he turns into a teenager and he has
[31:04] opinions of about
[31:07] everything uh mom white this Dad me too
[31:11] I think you know the type of the church
[31:13] is the type of uh Christ and uh us uh
[31:19] the pastor can have a leadership over
[31:21] the church but the church can have the
[31:23] opinions Ah that's brother bram's way of
[31:25] looking at things I have my own opinions
[31:27] and things you know but then at the same
[31:30] time now people don't understand the
[31:32] consequences that comes with it
[31:35] amen they can think that you know they
[31:37] have all these ideas that are good to
[31:40] present like you know brother Bram said
[31:42] this but I think myself also
[31:44] this uh but then uh those consequences
[31:48] that uh the world that we are living in
[31:50] the result that we have around us is
[31:52] because people are too much opinionated
[31:55] they have opinions about everything
[31:58] uh then it also happen in the Bible as
[32:01] we are seeing we just read it here in
[32:04] the book of first king 19 uh any student
[32:08] of the word knows that uh every single
[32:12] verse of the Bible unfolds God's
[32:15] program uh we have received the prophet
[32:19] today by God's grace so we have seen the
[32:21] pill of fire that bread that wrote the
[32:24] old and the New Testament uh explain to
[32:27] us what the Bible is in this last days
[32:29] and uh this spill of fire that when it
[32:32] came down it didn't just come to confirm
[32:35] that the prophet was true but to convey
[32:38] a message and that's why we are guarded
[32:41] as we are um Elijah was uh the prophet
[32:46] of a certain time and God used that
[32:50] spirit so uh so that the the The Stance
[32:54] of the spirit that he knew that hea
[32:57] could use this Spirit once again I'll be
[33:00] able to fulfill my program it's not
[33:02] necessarily the spirit of the man Elijah
[33:06] but it was God in the form of the
[33:09] Prophet called Elijah and uh in Sunday
[33:12] time God spoke baram says in the prophet
[33:16] God was in the prophet speaking to the
[33:18] people then it came to pass that you
[33:20] know as God's program was come to pass
[33:23] Elijah had witho Jezebel and his
[33:28] uh program with everything that she had
[33:31] because you know the history of the
[33:33] Bible how Jezebel came into Israel by
[33:36] the marriage of uh a borderline believer
[33:41] and this
[33:42] borderline gave her permission to rise
[33:46] to where she was that he was only the
[33:50] facade of the church he was only the
[33:53] facade of the country that I am the
[33:55] president but it was the lobby behind
[33:58] him that was pulling all the strings
[34:01] that's right and now this system then
[34:04] that God now so that he was not fit to
[34:07] be in the church not to be fit to be in
[34:10] um in the country then God had to send
[34:13] his Prophet around when the prophet came
[34:15] about you know the story he challenged
[34:17] the prophet of bals and and all these
[34:20] things came about and uh the story that
[34:23] you read there in the book of First
[34:26] Kings then he found himself that after
[34:29] all this anointing he went his
[34:32] way God fed him for about few times
[34:36] there and then he said okay go thaty way
[34:38] he went to the cave in the cave he found
[34:41] himself with all this uh Thunders and
[34:44] shaking and Lightnings and all these
[34:47] things here but then after all these
[34:49] things then the voice of the Lord came
[34:52] to him and say what are you doing
[34:55] here Church what are you
[34:59] here why do you come to church you're
[35:02] not in the
[35:03] world you wear long
[35:06] skirts you are called a brother in the
[35:09] message a sister in the message but now
[35:12] we come to the point the Thundering is
[35:15] gone all the shouting is
[35:18] gone when we come to church people don't
[35:20] shout as much as they started at the
[35:23] beginning anymore amen it's not that
[35:25] it's wrong but now they get to a certain
[35:29] point what are you doing
[35:31] here then the Lord comes and says well
[35:34] I'm going to give you another commission
[35:37] you've done what you did yesterday but
[35:40] now there's another portion of the work
[35:42] that is being
[35:44] revealed as time goes as brother bham
[35:47] say light upon light follows you see
[35:50] more it yesterday then you don't have to
[35:53] stop you need to be fed and so that you
[35:56] can be able to move a little bit bit
[35:57] ahead again in the in the journey and it
[36:00] come to pass that him verse 17 uh the
[36:04] Bible says it come to pass when uh uh uh
[36:08] uh Elijah was given the commission it
[36:11] said that and he it come shall pass that
[36:14] him that escape of the sword of of AEL J
[36:19] shall J slay and him that escape from
[36:23] The Sword of je shall Elisha slay
[36:28] in this great vision anybody can read
[36:31] the Bible and know like you know oh well
[36:35] have preached about this and things but
[36:37] then in here we see that Elijah has G
[36:43] been given the
[36:44] prophecy Elijah comes and tells us that
[36:48] there are certain number of prophecies
[36:51] Vision that the Lord had given me in
[36:54] 1933 and he sees them to come to pass he
[36:57] said that oh i' would like to see them
[37:00] happen because even in the last Vision
[37:03] he saw himself all the way to the end
[37:06] that the last Vision he turned around
[37:09] and he saw the effect of the last
[37:12] Vision but we still here but he's
[37:15] gone and the prophet and Elijah also was
[37:20] also to anoint asahel was to anoint je
[37:25] was to anoint Elisha right but it
[37:30] didn't but then the prophecy cannot fail
[37:36] amen that's why knowing Jesus it's not
[37:40] knowing the
[37:41] form it's not looking at the one who's
[37:44] speaking to you but knowing him in his
[37:47] ways because in the book of Psalm it
[37:49] says that you know the going of the Lord
[37:52] in the sanctuary has is moving in the
[37:54] sanctuary is taking different forms and
[37:57] different shapes and fulfilling the very
[38:00] prophecy that he wanted to fulfill in
[38:04] different shapes because he has hided to
[38:07] The
[38:08] Prudent because any prudent say must
[38:12] come back around and fulfill this
[38:14] year that's why any human understanding
[38:18] will understand from reading of the word
[38:20] but then the Lord now reveals it to them
[38:25] babes such as we learn amen and only
[38:28] those who are ready to learn will be
[38:31] able to learn but those who are
[38:34] highminded
[38:35] have opinions about everything brother
[38:39] Bram said this I think it should be this
[38:41] way I don't believe that I don't see
[38:43] that way I've running into history I
[38:46] found that it is wrong yes continue so
[38:49] and the prophecy will be fulfilled right
[38:51] next to you and you won't see it and as
[38:56] the prophecy is being fulfilled fil the
[38:58] word comes about and we see that jeu
[39:02] must be
[39:04] anointed and Je holds a mystery in his
[39:08] life asahel holds a mystery in his life
[39:12] elishah also holds a mystery in his life
[39:16] and all these three
[39:19] people were born under the ministry of
[39:23] Elijah and everything that all these
[39:26] three people are going to fulfill is
[39:29] based upon the word that proceeded from
[39:33] Elijah amen
[39:35] right so everything else that will come
[39:39] after the departure of elij of
[39:42] Elijah is because Elijah said
[39:46] so Elijah tell told us that we I have
[39:50] seen these seven visions and these seven
[39:54] Visions will come to pass because it is
[39:58] that said the
[40:00] Lord but our highminded high learned
[40:04] people in this last days they said well
[40:07] no brother Bram is just like a man like
[40:12] us he's just another
[40:16] prophet he has he thought about saying
[40:20] this and I think I can also say
[40:23] this but they didn't know that when they
[40:26] were doing that they were fulfilling
[40:28] exactly what Elijah
[40:31] said but because they were not anointed
[40:35] to be among elij Elisha's group that's
[40:40] why they had to behave that way and
[40:42] because they were not part of Elijah's
[40:44] group they have to be ael's group or J's
[40:49] group and tonight we'll start with Jo's
[40:52] group until we get to Elijah's
[40:55] group and as we see
[40:58] while all these things are
[41:01] happening the Bible says in John 16:19
[41:04] he said now Jesus knew that they were
[41:08] desirous to ask him and said unto them
[41:11] do ye require among yourself that I said
[41:14] a little while and ye shall not see me
[41:18] and again a little while and ye ye shall
[41:21] see me verily verely I say unto you that
[41:25] ye shall weep and lament but the world
[41:29] shall
[41:30] rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but
[41:33] your sorrow shall be turn into Joy
[41:37] Hallelujah while all this prophecies
[41:40] happening the verse 21 and a woman when
[41:44] she is in she is in travail have Sorrows
[41:49] because her hour is come but as soon as
[41:53] she is delivered of the child she
[41:56] remember no more the anguish for the joy
[42:00] that a man is Born Into the
[42:03] world the timing that this prophecy was
[42:07] given and gives also other
[42:11] information how
[42:12] does anointing three people gets
[42:17] connected with a woman being in travel
[42:21] or in birth
[42:23] pain it's because all these two these
[42:26] two people people asahel and Je have
[42:30] sent to
[42:32] help Elisha or the bride or the church
[42:36] be ready for the delivery of the
[42:39] baby but then now je
[42:42] himself was a type of a spirit in the
[42:47] days in which we are living in and when
[42:50] this Spirit comes to be
[42:53] fulfilled there had to be reasons why
[42:56] this Spirit had to be
[42:57] fulfill because
[43:00] as jeu came into the world it was not
[43:03] just
[43:05] because everything was just fine or
[43:08] everything was uh according to God's
[43:11] word that J came to pass no it was
[43:16] because Jezebel was in the
[43:20] land why was Jezebel in the land because
[43:24] Jezebel came into the world
[43:27] took hold of all the systems turned all
[43:31] the profit onto
[43:33] herself and the word shows us that
[43:36] brother bam teaches us that Jezebel we
[43:39] know is the Catholic
[43:42] church and the Catholic church is a
[43:45] whole system of itself it's the
[43:48] Incarnation of the Devil
[43:50] Himself and this system went into the
[43:54] world and designed the world in the way
[43:56] that we know that we see them
[44:00] and when Jezebel went into the
[44:04] world they took over everything after
[44:08] taking over everything then the Russians
[44:11] says no we don't like this right all of
[44:15] you who study history will see that in
[44:17] the
[44:18] 1500s when the Catholic Church went to
[44:21] into uh Russia they said like you know
[44:24] these people keep getting rich and Rich
[44:26] and Rich nature and we are getting poor
[44:29] and poor over the days then they got
[44:32] kicked
[44:33] out but Jezebel when she came in she
[44:37] didn't come in as though she came to
[44:41] take the money she came in with the form
[44:45] of
[44:46] religion she came in with the form of
[44:50] Christianity she brought the Bible into
[44:53] the into the to the
[44:55] people you you you are pagans you don't
[44:59] know what you're doing we're going to
[45:01] show you how you're going to leave but
[45:04] then they started taking the very Bible
[45:07] that they were supposed to give the
[45:08] people and show the people how to turn
[45:11] them into Christians but then they
[45:13] started using all the resources of the
[45:15] people you don't need the
[45:18] land you see the Bible says oh you have
[45:22] to be poor and all these things that
[45:26] goes with it
[45:28] and then from there was born
[45:31] communism that's right and why is
[45:34] communism
[45:35] around and why is J Around And as
[45:40] communism was taking place as a little
[45:43] bit of definition it says a communist
[45:45] communist Society will entail the
[45:47] absence of private property and social
[45:51] classes and ultimately and uh ultimately
[45:55] money and State or a nation Gathering
[46:01] everything listen to this we have
[46:05] Jezebel standing on one
[46:07] hand taking all the
[46:10] resources getting everything with them
[46:14] but then on the other
[46:16] end the call Marks comes and say well
[46:21] the way we see things are being done
[46:23] here is not
[46:24] correct let's do a whole another thing
[46:27] of
[46:28] ourselves let's make everything common
[46:32] yeah remember that word
[46:35] common let's make everything comeon but
[46:39] they didn't see where that communism was
[46:43] going to lead
[46:45] them because it has to be God's way or
[46:49] no
[46:51] way and as je came into the land he
[46:56] started showing the people how necessary
[46:59] it was to cast out Jezebel yeah which
[47:03] was
[47:04] true but then at the same time they also
[47:07] took the Bible and cast it out and by
[47:11] casting the Bible out brother bam say
[47:13] you see that's where the mistake they
[47:17] did amen at the same time also because
[47:20] they had no repair they had no reference
[47:24] to go to because of God said it shall be
[47:28] so for you to be partaker of Elisha's
[47:32] group it's not by you're
[47:35] choosing for you to be part of the Bride
[47:38] is not by your
[47:39] willing because you can be still part of
[47:42] the church but you are not the
[47:45] church because you can still listen to
[47:47] the word every day but you are not part
[47:50] of it you can even preach the word but
[47:53] you are not part of the word because
[47:55] Judah found himself in the same position
[47:58] given all the position but because of
[48:02] money then a whole another Spirit took
[48:05] him over he wasn't fellowshipping with
[48:09] the cuses and the cuses he was in the
[48:12] very Church of the Living
[48:14] God as much as we see the church
[48:18] today we are part of the church because
[48:21] we like a certain
[48:23] pastor we like a certain the way the
[48:26] sound system is we like the way the
[48:29] women in that church is
[48:31] are people have all kinds of
[48:34] reasons and they see that it's very good
[48:38] that if I am common with everybody else
[48:42] then I can find my way
[48:45] through because in that day the many
[48:49] women will come and say just give us
[48:51] your name yeah we want to be
[48:55] Christians we we just just call me
[48:58] Christians but but everything else I'll
[49:00] take care of myself I have my money I'll
[49:04] pay my bills but let me just like you
[49:07] know by facade just be called that I am
[49:10] your wife just as we see with the
[49:13] politicians they live all kinds of life
[49:16] but then they say that this is my
[49:18] wife and that's what it is also with the
[49:21] church we are partaker of the church we
[49:26] may pay our tithes we may pay our
[49:28] offerings but we are not able to take
[49:31] the word within and that's where the
[49:34] communism Spirit
[49:39] begins and brother Bram says and that's
[49:43] where you are found
[49:47] trapped we're going to read it that's
[49:49] where you are found to be trapped you
[49:52] thought that you were
[49:53] smart you thought that you had all the
[49:56] understanding and knowledge but remember
[49:58] your life is tied to Elijah's
[50:01] prophecy your life is tied to the seven
[50:05] visions and in those
[50:08] Visions brother Bram says in the message
[50:11] the deity of Jesus Christ 194 uh
[50:15] 49 paragraph 122 Heavenly Father oh
[50:19] Jesus I'm looking forward for a great
[50:22] hour I see it coming what is the hour
[50:26] coming I see there is no hope no else
[50:31] nowhere else I see the age The Edge and
[50:35] moving up I see the great lights of
[50:38] Communism swaying around over the earth
[50:43] I see the formal Church taking the
[50:45] standard against your church trying to
[50:48] condemn them saying Divine Healing is
[50:50] wrong it's a bunch of fanaticism a build
[50:54] on our white or a build in on a bill in
[50:59] our own White House to close it
[51:02] down the hour in which the prophet was
[51:06] saying this in
[51:08] 49 he said it's coming I see it
[51:12] coming but people didn't say it in
[51:16] 49 but it was coming on the people am
[51:20] but people had to make a choice and at
[51:22] the same time
[51:24] 1949 the same time the Lord sends his
[51:27] Prophet on the field go find that bride
[51:30] go find that people and as he goes on it
[51:35] says well Mark Marx believed that
[51:40] capitalism with its emphasis on profit
[51:43] and private ownership led to inequality
[51:46] among citizens thus his goal was to
[51:50] encourage A system that Pro promoted a
[51:53] classless society to which everyone Shar
[51:57] the benefits of Labor and the state
[52:00] government control all the property and
[52:04] wealth they wanted a
[52:08] society where the state controlled
[52:12] everything but then all of us
[52:17] classless brother bham says one thing I
[52:20] can debate with him
[52:23] classless but in the vision he was
[52:26] standing up there and you were walking
[52:28] on down
[52:30] there but then here
[52:33] classless the pastor says one thing no I
[52:37] think I can have my
[52:39] ideas woman this is your position no I
[52:43] can do anything I want
[52:46] classless a
[52:48] society that marks wanted to do why
[52:52] because those who carried the word at
[52:55] first in the name of
[52:58] Christianity came with a whole different
[53:01] story they went into the lands they said
[53:05] like you know they found people naked
[53:07] they said like you know you how you how
[53:10] why why you naked we're going to show
[53:11] you how to
[53:13] dress we're going to teach you a new
[53:15] form of language we're going to tell you
[53:18] how to speak better ways we're going to
[53:21] make you civilize a civilized so
[53:25] Society but by doing that they had a
[53:28] whole different story behind was to take
[53:31] over just as he said in Matthew 4 he
[53:34] said all these kingdoms belong to
[53:38] me and he also wanted to bring the word
[53:41] itself to submit to him but then the
[53:44] word said no no no no thou shall Worship
[53:48] the Lord God
[53:50] Alone the word cannot bow to you that's
[53:54] right and it is a mystery today yeah to
[53:57] have people also who understand this
[54:00] mystery in this last day why communism
[54:03] is Among
[54:04] Us what is communism it's not the I'm
[54:08] not talking about the political system
[54:12] how to govern a city how to govern a
[54:14] country no we talking about what jail is
[54:20] what Elijah's prophecy is supposed to be
[54:23] and how it's going to pass and how it's
[54:26] affecting the people and each one of us
[54:29] will have to make a decision one of
[54:31] these
[54:32] days either I am embracing je
[54:36] communism as a hell or
[54:41] Elisha and in all of these places here
[54:45] the decision begins at the very moment
[54:48] that you're hearing this amen from the
[54:51] few examples because the uh brother Bram
[54:54] is in the message uh let deian Church
[54:57] age churches book he's showing us now
[55:00] these Visions he said like you know the
[55:02] third Vision was in the realm of in the
[55:05] world politics for it showed me that
[55:08] there would be three ISM fascism Nazism
[55:11] you know what it was and and the isue of
[55:14] it communism but the first two would be
[55:17] swallowed up into the third because the
[55:21] first two were the two ISM in the world
[55:25] that show showed us how to be
[55:30] civilized but then now when people were
[55:32] fed up with the first two then the third
[55:35] one had to come to
[55:38] pass and now the third one now the first
[55:42] two which will be swallowed up into the
[55:44] third The Voice admonished watch Russia
[55:49] watch Russia keep your eyes on the King
[55:51] of the
[55:53] North following now this
[55:56] communism has it going about it's
[56:00] showing us exactly what is happening
[56:04] when communism in a state of
[56:08] classless people not knowing their
[56:11] position people thinking that they
[56:13] Untitled because Fascism and N Nazism
[56:18] has given them all the knowledge of the
[56:21] world they said no we don't want
[56:24] that we're going to Pro provide ourself
[56:27] a better way and by trying to provide
[56:29] thems a better way brother bam says that
[56:34] in the for vision it was the
[56:39] advancement of science after World War
[56:42] II amen and as all these things was
[56:46] happening people started to learn
[56:49] because you remember you know the the
[56:51] history of uh of the United
[56:54] States living
[56:57] Europe for the freedom of uh of
[57:00] religion because they understood that
[57:03] the system in place was not the right
[57:06] system because they wanted to worship
[57:09] but then after coming to the US then
[57:12] they started their
[57:14] way then they forgot everything that
[57:17] they left the Europe to come here to
[57:22] do probably not the rest of the
[57:24] countries in the world have experienc
[57:26] the same things but also all of us came
[57:31] from
[57:32] somewhere and said that you know we
[57:34] don't believe the world anymore and we
[57:36] believe the message and we get into the
[57:39] message then we present a whole
[57:42] different type of Lifestyle
[57:47] now we we present a whole different type
[57:50] you know I am a Christian I was in when
[57:53] I was poor I was serving the lord and
[57:56] know all this and then all of a sudden
[57:58] now you have the
[58:00] knowledge you speak a better
[58:03] English you come from
[58:06] Africa you have a job now now all of a
[58:11] sudden who shall tell me
[58:13] anything I go to church when I
[58:16] want I show up when I want nobody will
[58:20] tell me anything yeah we are all equal
[58:24] you can tell me anything what to do
[58:27] I do what I need to do I look at you the
[58:29] way I look at you that communism
[58:33] Spirit and the prophecy says he that
[58:37] shall
[58:38] Escape as a hell
[58:42] swld shall
[58:44] Z kill him but if you escape Z and you
[58:49] come in the
[58:50] church I bet you won't Escape Elisha's
[58:54] sword tonight amen
[58:57] good because it has to come in
[59:00] Simplicity not in big words but then as
[59:03] the word is revealing this then we look
[59:07] into our
[59:08] lives because we can't stand and say
[59:10] like you know this church oh those
[59:12] people oh America is doomed say th said
[59:15] the Lord we are the bride yes that's
[59:19] good but now when we get here after
[59:22] World War II baram says I so
[59:28] science going
[59:30] higher higher
[59:33] learning higher
[59:35] understanding and with all that learning
[59:38] and understanding people will turn back
[59:42] from where they came from without even
[59:45] realizing people were
[59:47] transformed into the image of the Beast
[59:51] without realizing amen they were turned
[59:54] into the image of the Beast yet in the
[59:58] church because when Judah received the
[1:00:02] anointing of the devil to kill Jesus he
[1:00:05] was still in
[1:00:10] church because all the makeups and all
[1:00:13] the extensions and all the high heels
[1:00:15] are happening right in the church
[1:00:20] amen because they have
[1:00:24] quotations because they have
[1:00:27] understanding because we have
[1:00:31] opinions because we can also tell
[1:00:33] brother bam where he is
[1:00:35] wrong because we can show him is his
[1:00:39] mistakes because we can show him where
[1:00:42] quotation contradicts itself why because
[1:00:47] of Science in the for
[1:00:51] vision because of
[1:00:53] learning because now we can just have
[1:00:57] our iPad and just type the
[1:00:59] words and show like you know look look
[1:01:01] look look Ean 52 53 look at all the
[1:01:05] mistakes he
[1:01:09] did and J was swallowing them up they
[1:01:13] were not seeing it but they thought that
[1:01:17] they were
[1:01:18] smart of course you were
[1:01:20] smart of course you have wisdom of
[1:01:24] course we have all this knowledge
[1:01:27] very quiet tonight
[1:01:30] huh and in the fif
[1:01:33] Vision after all this learning and all
[1:01:36] this knowledge in the fif Vision the
[1:01:39] morality sets in right an issue with
[1:01:45] morality people walking
[1:01:48] about why because now I have the right
[1:01:52] and in the world they don't talk about
[1:01:54] human duties
[1:01:57] they only talk about human
[1:01:59] rights I have the right to do this I
[1:02:02] have the right to do that I can do this
[1:02:04] I can do that but they don't tell you
[1:02:07] what you have to
[1:02:08] do but they don't tell you what's your
[1:02:11] position but they don't tell you what
[1:02:13] you have to
[1:02:15] do because of these
[1:02:18] rights or everything that we do the way
[1:02:21] we do
[1:02:22] them Elijah gave the prophecy
[1:02:26] if you escape the first the third the
[1:02:28] third one will catch
[1:02:30] you if you say well it's the we are the
[1:02:33] bride we are the bride that's good but
[1:02:36] then under the fourth
[1:02:38] vision and under the
[1:02:41] fifth each one of us shall find Our
[1:02:45] Place what shall we do with this Jesus
[1:02:48] called the Christ what shall do shall we
[1:02:51] do with this message that we have in
[1:02:53] this hour amen why
[1:02:58] communism the world brother say proof of
[1:03:01] his resurrection and the world only
[1:03:04] oneir of them on in this Easter morning
[1:03:07] knows of heard about Jesus butam says
[1:03:12] 2/3 of the world is in communism and in
[1:03:17] darkness
[1:03:21] two3 but then anybody that went to
[1:03:23] school will look at like no we only know
[1:03:26] China to be the communist country no
[1:03:28] he's not talking about
[1:03:31] that we only know he like no but brother
[1:03:34] bam say America has become a communist
[1:03:40] Society but anybody that went to school
[1:03:43] who smart will say well no you're wrong
[1:03:46] this is a capitalist
[1:03:49] Society we have freedom we can do
[1:03:52] whatever we want exactly that freedom
[1:03:55] that's what communism is all
[1:03:59] about because when you don't see the
[1:04:02] devil and his
[1:04:04] tricks he's going to take you in without
[1:04:08] even knowing that's what Jesus said to
[1:04:10] Peter he said I have prayed for you
[1:04:13] because the devil really wanted to take
[1:04:15] care of
[1:04:17] you he was in
[1:04:20] church a fervent
[1:04:23] believer with revelation
[1:04:28] Peter with Revelation being right there
[1:04:31] in the church and it says
[1:04:34] experiences it
[1:04:36] says
[1:04:38] now there is coming a confederation of
[1:04:41] churches it's already National and they
[1:04:45] conf they're
[1:04:46] confederating and there's to great power
[1:04:49] IM moving in the world you know what
[1:04:52] they they are they are without telling
[1:04:54] they are without telling there is
[1:04:57] communistic power and the other one is
[1:05:02] Catholicism and communism is coming
[1:05:04] together one against Christ the other
[1:05:09] Catholic Church these two powers are
[1:05:12] coming together every person in the
[1:05:16] world is going to be under obligation to
[1:05:19] take sides with one or the other
[1:05:27] I know the way I'm presenting it not
[1:05:30] everything is lined up yet it's not it's
[1:05:32] not a sermon it's it's a Ser but I have
[1:05:34] to break it down
[1:05:38] slowly
[1:05:40] communism two3 of the
[1:05:42] world Elijah's prophecy is
[1:05:45] there everyone have to make a
[1:05:49] choosing because everyone has the
[1:05:53] opinions and in this age
[1:05:57] says the leodan church age this age is
[1:06:00] is the last of the of the seven Church
[1:06:03] ages what began in the first of Ephesian
[1:06:07] Church Ephesian age must and will come
[1:06:10] to full fruitrition and harvest in the
[1:06:13] last last o leodan age the two Vines
[1:06:18] will yield the final fruit the two
[1:06:22] spirits will terminate the manifestation
[1:06:25] in in each of their final destination
[1:06:30] yes each one of
[1:06:33] us we have to make a choosing
[1:06:37] amen either
[1:06:40] communism or either
[1:06:45] Isel or
[1:06:48] Elisha and despite of these three
[1:06:52] there's only two spirits
[1:06:56] and these two Spirits each one of us
[1:06:58] will make a
[1:07:00] choosing but then glory be to God the
[1:07:03] fact that the prophet has given us these
[1:07:06] informations the pillow fire has come
[1:07:09] down has given us these informations so
[1:07:12] we can be able to make our decision
[1:07:16] clearly so we can know that the path of
[1:07:19] what we are
[1:07:21] following will lead us
[1:07:23] somewhere because the fruit or the seed
[1:07:27] shall come back to seed again yes and as
[1:07:32] the seed is going into all the
[1:07:36] stages each one of us will understand
[1:07:40] already from the stages where we are
[1:07:44] what can the seed we shall bear at the
[1:07:46] End
[1:07:48] Amen and when we are seeing certain
[1:07:53] things thank God that we are not trees
[1:07:56] just standing on one place but God has
[1:07:59] given us a soul a mind of understanding
[1:08:04] to be able to make the
[1:08:07] choice and he has provided a way and
[1:08:10] God's provided way he said
[1:08:13] Elijah you shall anoint
[1:08:18] Elisha and Elijah's
[1:08:21] prophecy ended up with the rapture
[1:08:27] as Jew's prophecy ended up in
[1:08:32] ashes each one of us will have to make a
[1:08:35] choice and while these choices are
[1:08:38] taking place he said that you shall come
[1:08:40] to the to the destination the
[1:08:44] sewing the watering the growing is all
[1:08:48] over is all over summer is
[1:08:53] ended he is preaching is preaching it on
[1:08:56] the age level we know Le this year is
[1:09:01] over the sum has come up we've seen the
[1:09:04] cloud the seven angels and and all these
[1:09:07] things and but let not that blind
[1:09:12] you to be in the
[1:09:14] church to be
[1:09:17] called
[1:09:19] bride but yet when we walk
[1:09:22] outside we embrace all kind of lives
[1:09:28] amen and while these things are taking
[1:09:32] place we'll take the time to break it
[1:09:34] down into modern
[1:09:36] events why are things happening the way
[1:09:39] they're
[1:09:41] happening why is Putin behaving the way
[1:09:45] he's
[1:09:46] behaving why Iran is behaving the way he
[1:09:51] behaving why the the the top of
[1:09:54] Technology is going where it's
[1:09:57] going and why the wars are happening the
[1:10:00] way they happening in Africa
[1:10:02] specifically for
[1:10:04] them and all these things is to show
[1:10:08] that people have to make a
[1:10:11] choice and the church us also will have
[1:10:14] to make a choice and as we are making
[1:10:16] that
[1:10:18] choice understand what kind of seed you
[1:10:21] are putting in because the prophet has
[1:10:24] declared on on the age level like
[1:10:26] elishah did but now we also on the
[1:10:30] individual level as a family as a church
[1:10:36] as a community we also have to make the
[1:10:39] same choices right and when we are
[1:10:43] making those choices it's not a choice
[1:10:46] of the facade of just showing that I am
[1:10:50] I am I
[1:10:51] am because our very Works will prove was
[1:10:55] wrong our very Behavior will bring that
[1:10:59] to pass then you look and say oh really
[1:11:01] I never looked at myself that way time
[1:11:04] will come there's no need to
[1:11:06] rush because as the word is being laid
[1:11:11] down we seeing more than events before
[1:11:14] our eyes we are to understand which
[1:11:18] group are we part of Amen brother bam
[1:11:21] shows here
[1:11:25] while now this communist
[1:11:27] Society has been revealed displayed in
[1:11:31] the word people got all the knowledge in
[1:11:35] the history of
[1:11:37] America we have known Martin Luther
[1:11:41] King a very famous man out here for the
[1:11:45] black Comm black
[1:11:47] community oh we celebrate him he was
[1:11:51] such a great man for us
[1:11:55] but then he didn't understand what he
[1:11:57] was
[1:11:59] doing the country itself didn't
[1:12:02] understand what they were
[1:12:03] doing right because in their
[1:12:07] mind they communism will swallow Fascism
[1:12:12] and Nazism right not destroy but
[1:12:16] swallowed them amen you become what you
[1:12:21] eat by eating certain movies certain
[1:12:24] books and C certain places you become
[1:12:26] that
[1:12:27] person and by turning into
[1:12:31] that
[1:12:32] Society Martin Lu Martin Luther stands
[1:12:36] up and say no no no no no no no no
[1:12:38] Revolution we're going to need to be
[1:12:41] free all the schools that the white
[1:12:44] people go to we want to go to the same
[1:12:48] schools and some of the whites behind
[1:12:50] say well okay we also need them to come
[1:12:53] with us
[1:12:56] I know it's a very tricky subject in
[1:13:00] America when you speak about race and
[1:13:03] all these things people become tied up
[1:13:05] even in the church you can see
[1:13:08] that but we want to address it according
[1:13:11] to the
[1:13:13] word because the Bible the Bible didn't
[1:13:16] say black white yellow brown and all
[1:13:19] these things no it says
[1:13:21] azahel je and elishah
[1:13:25] and Elisha came from all over the world
[1:13:29] and communism we just read 23 of the
[1:13:32] world white black and everybody is in
[1:13:35] the same group yeah but then when
[1:13:39] communism finds his way among among the
[1:13:41] people he doesn't tell you I am a
[1:13:43] communist
[1:13:45] right nobody Among Us here will say I am
[1:13:48] a communist but our Behavior consciously
[1:13:53] and unconsciously will will determine
[1:13:56] who we are because you shall not see
[1:13:59] it's not by the words I speak I speak
[1:14:01] but by my fruit you shall know me
[1:14:05] amen because the seed is
[1:14:08] sold and if we have sown fism by
[1:14:13] disguise we have sown uh nism by
[1:14:17] disguise now we are
[1:14:22] communist it's not because I say I am a
[1:14:24] Christian love everybody I I as one of
[1:14:27] the brothers who preach here that uh I
[1:14:30] now accommodate everybody I can shake
[1:14:32] hands with him no we're not talking
[1:14:34] about that that's the facade let's read
[1:14:37] it in the
[1:14:38] Bible 2 King
[1:14:41] 9:30 and when je was come to jezrael
[1:14:45] Jezebel heard of it and she painted her
[1:14:52] face she painted a
[1:14:56] face
[1:14:58] communism now comes and brings us into
[1:15:02] all kind of
[1:15:03] forms you see somebody who Smiles at you
[1:15:06] but he's not
[1:15:07] smiling somebody who's greeting you but
[1:15:09] he's not he's not greeing somebody who's
[1:15:12] helping you but he's not helping why
[1:15:16] because Jezebel knows the end is
[1:15:20] here Jezebel can see that it is the end
[1:15:26] a bracket here to open the point in the
[1:15:29] Book of
[1:15:31] Daniel the king comes and say I have
[1:15:34] received a
[1:15:36] vision I have a
[1:15:39] dream something is going to
[1:15:42] happen something will
[1:15:44] happen he knows that he has a dream and
[1:15:48] despite the dream he said it is a very
[1:15:51] precious dream I'm not going to to show
[1:15:54] it to everybody
[1:15:55] I'm going to give it only to one the one
[1:15:59] is going to reveal it to me is the one
[1:16:01] that I'm going to deal
[1:16:03] with but look he knows what is going to
[1:16:08] happen you know the vision you know the
[1:16:11] dream Nebuchadnezzar's dream you see the
[1:16:15] statue you see the dispensation of time
[1:16:19] he sees everything they know
[1:16:23] that but because they know that that's
[1:16:27] what the end is he said I'm not going to
[1:16:30] die
[1:16:33] alone you
[1:16:36] understand he sees the vision he sees
[1:16:39] that gold brass silver
[1:16:44] iron iron and clay and this Stone comes
[1:16:50] down and he knows that everything that
[1:16:54] I've done all these
[1:16:56] years everything that I've
[1:16:59] built everything that I've invested in
[1:17:03] everything that I have presented to the
[1:17:06] world one day is going to be
[1:17:10] destroyed but there was Daniel and the
[1:17:14] rest of them that came from Israel into
[1:17:18] Babylon right and then in their turn
[1:17:22] only
[1:17:23] three out all those
[1:17:26] millions that came from Israel did not
[1:17:30] bow amen we are millions of us in the
[1:17:34] message we left Babylon and we came here
[1:17:39] but despite
[1:17:42] that not all of
[1:17:44] them were able to withstand the pressure
[1:17:47] of Babylon and that's what communist
[1:17:52] is people who are in the
[1:17:55] message we see them the way we see them
[1:17:59] we call them brothers we call them
[1:18:02] sisters but inside there's no real
[1:18:06] transformation Amen on and when the
[1:18:10] pressure comes quickly they give
[1:18:14] way because they only have the
[1:18:18] facade we only calling them brothers
[1:18:21] because they are in
[1:18:23] church but the true conversion that we
[1:18:26] are looking for is not
[1:18:28] found because in Elisha's group Elisha
[1:18:32] had to grow in the mantle of
[1:18:35] Elijah he didn't go and alter the the
[1:18:38] message say like you know oh I don't
[1:18:40] believe this oh this is before 1963 oh
[1:18:43] this I don't believe this I don't really
[1:18:45] think that you know everything is
[1:18:47] open he grew up in the
[1:18:52] mantle am that's why I don't want to sum
[1:18:57] up everything it's good to break it
[1:19:00] down and when Martin Luther saw that hey
[1:19:04] we have this opportunity now we have
[1:19:08] learned we have all this ability now to
[1:19:11] speak our voices we can gather the
[1:19:14] people we have white and black and all
[1:19:16] of us let's make a classless
[1:19:21] society and even themselves are
[1:19:24] according to history that the government
[1:19:27] and the system and the lobbyist and
[1:19:29] everything others were like no no no no
[1:19:31] we can't have the black Among Us and and
[1:19:33] all these things
[1:19:35] here they wanted to have the Jezebel
[1:19:39] system to keep lingering
[1:19:42] on but brother bam says
[1:19:45] Catholicism and communism is going to do
[1:19:49] what come
[1:19:53] together we can try to hold onto Jezebel
[1:19:57] system we can try to hold onto whatever
[1:20:01] we want to call it but understand at the
[1:20:05] end it's going to end
[1:20:07] somewhere and oh
[1:20:12] Lord and when je was come to jezrael and
[1:20:16] she painted her faces and tired her head
[1:20:20] and looked out of the
[1:20:22] window verse um to try to close here
[1:20:26] quickly and verse 32 and he lift up he
[1:20:29] lift up his head his face to the window
[1:20:31] and said who is on my side who and they
[1:20:35] looked out looked out to him two or
[1:20:38] three uh Unix and he said throw her down
[1:20:42] so they threw her down and some of her
[1:20:44] blood was sprinkled on the wall and and
[1:20:47] on um and on the horses and and he troed
[1:20:51] her under her
[1:20:52] foot and when he was come and he did it
[1:20:55] he did eat and drink and say go see now
[1:21:00] this cursed woman and bury her for she
[1:21:04] is the King's Daughter and they went to
[1:21:06] bury her but but they found no more of
[1:21:10] her than the skull the feet and the
[1:21:14] palms of her hands three
[1:21:18] things the
[1:21:20] hands the
[1:21:22] feet and the skull scull speaks of the
[1:21:26] Mind hand speaks of The Works feet
[1:21:29] speaks of the work
[1:21:33] right we understand when je comes and
[1:21:36] does his job when Fascism and social and
[1:21:41] and and nism is swallowed up into
[1:21:45] communism it seems like you know it's a
[1:21:49] whole different world now but it's not
[1:21:52] it is just the same devil
[1:21:55] taking a whole different form because it
[1:21:58] is still Jezebel taking painting or
[1:22:02] faces and when we come in the
[1:22:05] church many Jezebel that we have have
[1:22:09] painted their
[1:22:10] faces she doesn't like to be
[1:22:13] natural she wants to put some uh no I
[1:22:17] don't I don't like my hair I like to put
[1:22:19] a little bit something here why because
[1:22:23] knowledge has helped them out and that
[1:22:27] knowledge had led them exactly into the
[1:22:30] fifth the fifth uh the fifth Vision
[1:22:33] which is the moral of
[1:22:35] women and this immorality among the
[1:22:39] women it's not just the sisters but the
[1:22:43] churches too amen they rebel against the
[1:22:46] authority of God butam says Jezebel
[1:22:49] might not like it or not but Elijah was
[1:22:52] still her prop Pastor that's right
[1:22:57] we may like it or not the prophet is
[1:23:00] still the
[1:23:02] prophet and our behaviors and everything
[1:23:06] that we do I know it can hurt it can be
[1:23:08] hard to say but we have to say it and we
[1:23:13] have to show it by the prophet why we
[1:23:15] have to say these
[1:23:18] things it's not
[1:23:20] simple but we have to grow into that
[1:23:23] mantle and if we can grow into the
[1:23:25] mantle then we have to
[1:23:28] choose which are which one are we going
[1:23:30] to
[1:23:32] serve Martin Luther he went down and he
[1:23:36] starts telling the people say well you
[1:23:39] know let's have all this Society we
[1:23:41] don't need all this aggressions and we
[1:23:44] can be all
[1:23:46] this the following Vision the woman had
[1:23:50] the vote the right to
[1:23:52] vote she was able now to get into all
[1:23:56] the
[1:23:58] places she gets in there she's able to
[1:24:02] have a job
[1:24:03] now but look at where that led him all
[1:24:07] of us we have to
[1:24:10] work all of us we have to
[1:24:13] work and while we are seeking all these
[1:24:16] jobs and all these opportunities and all
[1:24:18] these
[1:24:20] things brother Bram says you'll excuse
[1:24:23] me my sisters that nearly 90% of them
[1:24:27] are
[1:24:29] prostitutes because they go in those
[1:24:31] places nearly
[1:24:36] 90% And that
[1:24:39] 90% who are those are going to stand
[1:24:43] today who are
[1:24:47] they we are there on the work on the job
[1:24:50] on the job job places we see them the
[1:24:52] way they behave you see them the way
[1:24:54] they
[1:24:56] behave she's unable to stay under the
[1:25:00] authority and from there now she goes
[1:25:04] into the greatest chaos
[1:25:06] ever if we have a 10% glory be to God as
[1:25:10] the prophet says I believe there will be
[1:25:13] some just as it was in Babylon so shall
[1:25:16] it be today there's nothing new Under
[1:25:19] the
[1:25:19] Sun this communism brother brother I'm
[1:25:22] say I'm not going to read brother says
[1:25:25] it's because we have
[1:25:27] forsaken the word that's why God had to
[1:25:31] release
[1:25:33] communism every single nation every one
[1:25:36] of
[1:25:37] us there is a stage where we believe the
[1:25:40] word we embrace the word we say Amen we
[1:25:44] go we move forward but then there will
[1:25:46] become a time then the squeeze will
[1:25:51] come I'm saying the squeeze will come
[1:25:54] and that squeeze is communism and that
[1:25:57] communism now will bring forth your
[1:26:02] character opinion opinions I think this
[1:26:07] I know this I but Elijah said you
[1:26:12] sisters your place is with your
[1:26:18] children but this cannot be received by
[1:26:21] everybody why the seed
[1:26:24] of the Catholic church is in
[1:26:27] her and that seed in the church will be
[1:26:33] watered will'll grow we go through the
[1:26:37] stages and we'll come back to
[1:26:41] maturity and at the end when it comes to
[1:26:44] maturity butam says then we'll have to
[1:26:47] take the
[1:26:48] CLE at the
[1:26:52] foot that's why I don't want to go move
[1:26:54] quickly with these things because it has
[1:26:56] to be clear before
[1:26:58] us and if you have the time you go you
[1:27:01] dig deeper ready so that when I come
[1:27:03] here I can just feel the inspiration
[1:27:05] going
[1:27:08] faster we always preach according to
[1:27:11] where the people as the people are
[1:27:13] pulling and as you are pulling as the
[1:27:16] word is coming as you are pulling as the
[1:27:18] word is coming but then let God help us
[1:27:23] amen I'm not just talking about the the
[1:27:26] sisters each one of
[1:27:29] us we have a
[1:27:31] responsibility and that responsibility
[1:27:34] we may not see
[1:27:36] it but we'll get to those
[1:27:39] places how communism has taken us into
[1:27:43] the action right we think that it's
[1:27:46] liberty no there's no
[1:27:49] Freedom you are a purchased possession
[1:27:53] we are somebody's property we may like
[1:27:56] not we may not like the term or not but
[1:27:58] we belong to somebody
[1:28:03] amen Christ paid the price for a certain
[1:28:07] type of people and that people are going
[1:28:10] to do exactly as he
[1:28:13] says and those people don't have any
[1:28:17] opinions everything he says is amen amen
[1:28:22] amen I don't understand but it's
[1:28:26] Amen but then when we have all our
[1:28:31] opinions we can see
[1:28:34] that I believe everything but this year
[1:28:37] I cannot do of
[1:28:40] course I can do this here of course but
[1:28:43] then at the end we're going to say we
[1:28:48] knew Jesus said let them grow together
[1:28:51] we will not cast you out we will still
[1:28:54] call you brother we will still call each
[1:28:56] other
[1:28:57] Sisters Jesus called Judah my
[1:29:02] friend it's by kiss that thou uh betray
[1:29:06] the son of
[1:29:08] man we will still call you
[1:29:11] friends but then because it has to be so
[1:29:15] but then when now the Gathering comes
[1:29:18] they come to tie you
[1:29:20] up it's either you go in the garden or
[1:29:24] before you go into the
[1:29:27] fire and the choices are ours true we
[1:29:31] see that communism that when Martin
[1:29:34] Luther I'm really trying to get to this
[1:29:36] here if you can allow me that when
[1:29:40] communism came
[1:29:42] in brother Ram says thir
[1:29:47] Exodus what about the other day when we
[1:29:51] had this question of segregation down in
[1:29:53] the south
[1:29:55] I wish that I could talk talk to to that
[1:29:58] Minister that Martin Luther King how can
[1:30:02] the man be a
[1:30:05] leader don't just look at it as a
[1:30:08] history Martin Luther is the father of
[1:30:10] the house pastor of the church mother of
[1:30:13] the
[1:30:14] children minister of the church and all
[1:30:18] these people were supposed to do a
[1:30:20] certain thing to lead them in a certain
[1:30:22] way listen to what what I'm saying he
[1:30:25] say like how can the man be a leader and
[1:30:28] leading his people into a death
[1:30:34] trap it seemed like you know this is a
[1:30:37] revolution that we
[1:30:39] need it seemed that the brother at home
[1:30:42] it's it's it's good for my wife to be
[1:30:45] out there on the
[1:30:47] streets it's
[1:30:51] reasonable anybody will tell you brother
[1:30:54] according to your economics according to
[1:30:57] all that we see our sisters our children
[1:31:01] they have all this knowledge our
[1:31:03] churches now we have read M you can
[1:31:06] present all the knowledge you can
[1:31:09] present I know it's hard but somebody
[1:31:13] has to say it
[1:31:17] amen it's not always comfortable for us
[1:31:20] to come here and preach me messages like
[1:31:23] this
[1:31:24] but somebody has to do it right because
[1:31:29] the Bible says I should not hide the
[1:31:32] whole Council of God if I have to choose
[1:31:35] what when we just get amen amen amen
[1:31:38] amen but then the author of the word one
[1:31:41] day will say like you know you were
[1:31:43] given that inspiration because there are
[1:31:45] so many things that you know somebody
[1:31:48] can preach
[1:31:49] upon but only him
[1:31:52] knows what going on Among Us you young
[1:31:57] people who are wanting to get married
[1:31:59] you young people who are married you
[1:32:02] parents with children and all of us we
[1:32:05] are facing this challenge here amen
[1:32:09] because of this leader brother B say how
[1:32:12] can you be a
[1:32:14] leader how can you be responsible that
[1:32:17] you are you are leading your house your
[1:32:20] home your church your everything into a
[1:32:23] death trap and not seeing
[1:32:27] it how can you be
[1:32:30] that because remember she is not going
[1:32:33] to answer for you but you are going to
[1:32:36] answer for
[1:32:38] everything
[1:32:39] right as brother around usually says
[1:32:42] here I am only responsible for this
[1:32:45] group
[1:32:47] here he's going to answer what did you
[1:32:49] preach who did you let on the pulpit and
[1:32:51] all these things he's going to answer
[1:32:53] butam say my children repeat what says
[1:32:56] the
[1:32:57] tapes because I'm going to answer for
[1:33:01] it is Paul also going to be churches say
[1:33:04] yes I have preached exactly like Paul if
[1:33:07] those of Paul go in me also I shall go
[1:33:09] in amen it's not
[1:33:14] easy because the pented face of Jezebel
[1:33:18] is showing us the
[1:33:19] opportunities I am this you are this we
[1:33:22] can do this now we can this and now this
[1:33:25] year it's not we we we we we we left
[1:33:28] Africa because of opportunities and all
[1:33:30] these things here it's good give all the
[1:33:33] answers and all the explanation we want
[1:33:36] but the word Remains the word
[1:33:40] amen the word wants you to be in that
[1:33:43] place he wants you to be in that
[1:33:46] place Minister be a true minister of the
[1:33:49] Gospel don't come here and and try to
[1:33:52] give advice on
[1:33:54] you know according to today's world and
[1:33:57] no there's not today's world the word is
[1:33:59] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:04] that's it's not
[1:34:07] easy but those things must be preached
[1:34:10] amen we have to
[1:34:12] pull and only those who are
[1:34:15] predestinated seed will be able to see
[1:34:18] this otherwise you'll walk out of here
[1:34:22] offended you walk out of here offended
[1:34:25] but the bride will be able to see that
[1:34:28] there is a fine line between the truth
[1:34:32] and
[1:34:33] wrong and Ahab ended up in Jezebel
[1:34:37] system because he was a borderline
[1:34:40] believer but now the work now is to pull
[1:34:43] everybody right in the midst of the
[1:34:47] land and that work must be
[1:34:51] done it's not easy
[1:34:55] it's not just fun for me to come here
[1:34:56] and then and preach a message like this
[1:34:59] we know what the bride likes right you
[1:35:01] are predestinated the seven seal the
[1:35:03] word made flesh amen amen amen we know
[1:35:07] that and the church will oh brother we
[1:35:10] like that message yeah we know that but
[1:35:13] then when God wants to do the
[1:35:16] work the gifts is to set
[1:35:21] aside a True Believer
[1:35:24] from the work because I'm showing what
[1:35:27] we are supposed to
[1:35:30] do because Martin Luther is looking he's
[1:35:33] Leading the People brother bam says
[1:35:35] listen to this then we'll
[1:35:39] close it says if those people were
[1:35:42] slaves I'll be down there my of beating
[1:35:46] away for for for them people they're not
[1:35:49] slaves they're citizens the C citizen of
[1:35:53] the Nations the question of going to
[1:35:56] school them
[1:35:58] people them people if they got a hard a
[1:36:02] hard heart and don't know those
[1:36:04] things you can't drive you can't drive
[1:36:07] into a people spiritual things what is
[1:36:12] bit in there with political
[1:36:16] Powers they've got to accept it be born
[1:36:20] again then they'll see these
[1:36:25] things for you to see this you must be
[1:36:29] born again then you'll see
[1:36:32] it but brother bam continues he said but
[1:36:36] this man the leader the pastor the
[1:36:38] mother and
[1:36:39] everything if I could only speak to him
[1:36:42] the prophet of the hour if it could only
[1:36:45] preach to
[1:36:46] him if that Minister could only preach
[1:36:50] the
[1:36:51] word leading those precious
[1:36:55] people under the name of
[1:36:59] religion into a death trap where he
[1:37:02] going to kill thousands times thousands
[1:37:06] of them they just get the natural
[1:37:11] side oh we'll make the money we want to
[1:37:14] have our caruse you only seeing the
[1:37:17] natural side of
[1:37:20] things but it says that you must be born
[1:37:24] again for you to be able to see it amen
[1:37:29] that's that's why all these opinions
[1:37:32] that we
[1:37:34] have can be detrimental to
[1:37:37] us but if we can be born again receive
[1:37:42] the spirit and to start seeing those
[1:37:44] things and we'll get to there now that
[1:37:48] you who have who have reached
[1:37:50] there you have the ministry
[1:37:55] huh you have the ministry and what are
[1:37:57] you doing with that Ministry because
[1:38:00] AEL and Al Elijah right because it's
[1:38:05] Elijah that went to a woman that was
[1:38:12] dying it's Elijah that went to a woman
[1:38:17] with a dead
[1:38:20] son it's Elijah
[1:38:25] that even when he
[1:38:28] died from his
[1:38:32] bones that the dead man came to life
[1:38:37] amen you can study that already ahead of
[1:38:40] time but I'm just giving you those
[1:38:42] places that we have to dig into so that
[1:38:44] it's not just oh it's hard why you
[1:38:46] telling us this and our place no no no
[1:38:49] no no there's a whole
[1:38:52] program we have to see Jesus and his
[1:38:56] program if I hurt you in your feelings
[1:38:59] somewhere Cal down hold on you're going
[1:39:03] to like it
[1:39:06] afterward this is just uh the the the
[1:39:09] the the the big plan the big picture so
[1:39:11] you can be able to see at times like you
[1:39:13] know we strike you know clothing and all
[1:39:15] these things but that's not necessarily
[1:39:17] the point because at the end of the day
[1:39:20] you are the
[1:39:21] bride ah now I have
[1:39:26] amen
[1:39:28] huh why
[1:39:32] communism who us who are
[1:39:36] leaders sitting in Heavenly as we say
[1:39:39] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:39:42] Jesus huh by God's grace shall we
[1:39:46] pray Heavenly
[1:39:49] Father uh in humility and simplicity
[1:39:54] uh thank you Father for your grace thank
[1:39:58] you for your
[1:40:00] love as uh we are looking into these
[1:40:04] great
[1:40:05] things uh we know that the word the
[1:40:09] judgment begins in the house of
[1:40:12] God uh it's uh the Judgment for the
[1:40:15] bride is now because she's not going to
[1:40:18] stand in the Judgment time nor in the
[1:40:21] tribulation time because your Prophet
[1:40:23] warns us about all these things that are
[1:40:26] to come that's why we want to see Jesus
[1:40:29] and his program
[1:40:31] father lead us uh guide us Lord and
[1:40:35] reveal unto us Lord father God these
[1:40:37] wonderful things that you have uh laid

[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:19] heart today Lyon and I were praying
[1:51:24] and in our prayer we were saying what
[1:51:26] brother Mark was saying a minute ago and
[1:51:27] what Brother Martin was saying that the
[1:51:30] spirits that are coming amongst us it
[1:51:33] comes in all forms and all shapes and it
[1:51:36] it tries to come through the window and
[1:51:38] under the door it tries to do everything
[1:51:40] it can you you walk outside and it's
[1:51:42] like you're just like this you're just
[1:51:43] trying to get
[1:51:44] clean and these Spirits are all around
[1:51:47] us but you know God said I'll raise up a
[1:51:49] standard against it than and I believe
[1:51:51] that's what the Lord's doing for
[1:51:53] yeah to preach that message that brother
[1:51:55] martin preached tonight that took some
[1:51:58] guts to say what the prophet said about
[1:52:00] the spirit that was in that day he saw
[1:52:03] those things he saw what was happening
[1:52:05] and I thank God for our ministry that
[1:52:08] they're pointing these things out and
[1:52:10] they're showing us these things am it's
[1:52:13] not about the black or the white or the
[1:52:15] yellow or the
[1:52:17] no what it's about it's about spirits
[1:52:20] that are contrary to the word of God and
[1:52:22] God has given us his word it's his word
[1:52:26] that it will not return
[1:52:28] void and his word is what heals us and
