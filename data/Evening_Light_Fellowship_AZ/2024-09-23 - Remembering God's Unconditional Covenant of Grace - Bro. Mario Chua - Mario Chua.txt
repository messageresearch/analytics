Lord Lord and we praise you for the testimonies of how you have done Lord in our lives but the most important thing Lord as we gathered this morning is to hear from you Lord God so we just humble

lift up our faith Lord for this journey to the body chains Lord God bless it and everyone of us Lord even myself I humble myself Lord and I commit myself Lord and may be your mouthpiece this morning speak to your people in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen so God bless you greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and once again we welcome all our visitors this morning especially the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so uh turn with me in the book of Zechariah so I have two portion of scripture that we'll be reading this morning Zechariah 4:7 and John 1 verse 14-6 just a very simple thought this this morning I know that you heard uh already about this the Covenant of Grace that's why I titled my sermon this morning remembering God's unconditional Covenant of Grace amen amen it's always good to be reminded yes uh along the way in this journey sometimes we have so many trouble along the way we have so many issues and so we need to be it's good to be reminded of the grace of God in our lives Zechariah 4:7 it says who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone the of with shouting crying Grace Grace unto it and turn with me in the Book of John 1 verse4 and the word of the Lord was made flesh that mean it's made manifest and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth I JN bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake he that that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have all we receive Grace and uh and Grace for grace in other words we receive Grace upon Grace double portion of Grace we already receive a Grace but we need a double portion of Grace Grace for the changing of our bodies and Grace for rupturing Faith yes amen amen you may be seated God bless you amen so praise the Lord uh just help me pull sometime every time I stand at the pulpit they always say oh you've already been preaching for how many where you still so nervous when you stand in the Pulpit so I always uh thought in my mind that I'm not preaching to any Ordinary People wow I am not we are not preaching just to entertain or just make somebody laugh or we are preaching on the Bride of Jesus Christ and the Bride of Jesus Christ is so choosy you know what I mean we are always on the diet so we want something that will help uh we are in the natural we want to something uh to eat some physical that we can have strength so in the spiritual in the same way so we are on the diet for the spiritual food in Du season always uh it's very hard to seek the mind of God but it's always good that if you can help me this morning because I always say that we are just a delivery boy if you don't order I will not deliver so right that's right but if you if I can feel the pool so praise the Lord that will be God himself that will be speaking to us this morning so in the word of zerubabel or Zariah he said that who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shouting crying grace and grace and we know that zerubabel was a was the instrument in which the uh the temple in Babylon will be restored so he saw lot of obstacle while they are restoring the temple they saw a lot of obstacle along the way there's persecution a lot of things and he saw it just like a mountain but he said who art thou a great Mountain you see when we are in the Lord no M no mountain can withstand in the presence of the Lord because it is by God's grace alone that they finish the work of God Amen so we know that uh we the seventh Church AG the first church age start with Grace and now we end up with a double Grace in our generation not only Grace that we are saved by grace but Grace to create a rapturing faith in our heart and Grace for the changing of our body amen so we have a message that will create a rupturing faith in our heart amen so it's not just a a a story in the book that we will be changing a moment in the thinking of an ey but this is a reality because it creates a faith in our heart amen so The Headstone is what CS the pyramid we know that and the entire seven Church age of the body of theber who under the messes have believed and manifested the word for their day yes so this cstone is Christ in the form of the people and of the seven church with the revelations of the fullness of the word of God and we have already received the portion of that word just like Mary uh received the word when the angel of the Lord come before her in Luke 1 verse3 he said and the angel said unto her and we know that we have Angel also in our generation Revelation 10:1 the mighty angel coming down and he said fear not Mary it was directly addressed to Mary which is type of the church in this last days for thou H has found favor with God and the mighty angel that comes down in our generation speak directly to us and we found favor in the eye of God Amen and favor is actually means the word Grace we found Grace yes in the message of the hour amen so as the student of the message we have we know that the full mystery of justification was not fully revealed in Luther's day that's right but in our day the full revelation of justification was revealed by the seventh angel this that place and justifications uh means that not only we are forgiven of our sin but they forget our sin as if we never done it in the first place right and in the first place is in the mind of God amen amen and we are justified in the mind of God and never did it in the first first place and that means there's the grace of God in our life yes amen that's right so in the message Jehovah Gyra uh brother Branham explains about the three Covenant of of God J Jehovah Gyra paragraph 39 now there had been two covenants and one of them was Adam Covenant so the first man was Adam and when God created Adam in the image of God and he he was made flesh Le God gave him all the commission you can eat everything that you see except for the tree of knowledge of good evil because the day e of the day you die so there was a covenant and an agreement and if you will do what I said I will do it God made a covenant with a man if you will I will and he broke it then God made another Covenant with Noah that was Noah's Covenant and it was broke so you see God is so gracious he always extend his grace Adam Covenant and Noah's Covenant both of these men were head over race so that Covenant applies also to their offspring right so now he's making the abrahamic Covenant and the abrahamic Covenant according to Genesis chap 12 so I will read a portion of what brother br CH 12 in Genesis 12:1 he said now the Lord had said unto Abraham the Lord is speaking we don't know how he speak it with a loud voice with Audible Voice but the scripture the Lord speak the same with us we don't know how God spoke it maybe he will use a preacher maybe he will use somebody but God is spok speaking into our heart amen we come into this message of the are by different kind sometime we heard the preacher sometimes somebody shared to us but still it is God in different form God said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will sh thee what a great condition so there is always a separation when come to the Lord there is always a separation before the unconditional Covenant take effect there must be a separation first take away from all the unbelief the separation from your Father's Love from the land and he said and I will sh the the land you don't know where you're going but you need to depend on who is speaking to you that's why when God called us we don't know where where our lives will go through in this journey but we sure know that if God called us he will finish it yeah and I will make of thee a great Nation what a statement I will make thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing do you reject that promises wow and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curse thee and in the shall all the families of the earth be blessed that's the blessing or that's the Covenant that God made made with Abraham in chapter 12 so we'll continue with the message je Jehovah JRA it was given unconditionally therefore it's Eternal because it's unconditional that condition is still in effect today if we are Abraham's sin right yes not if you will I will he said I have already done it it is already past tense what been through in this life is already been done I have already done it whatever your issue whatever uh things that comes to your way if you are Abraham's SE this unconditional Covenant is still in effect because this unconditional Covenant is eternal Covenant amk Lord yeah I have already done it not I will do it I will do it is just future tense just like you have to have some condition before I will do it but he said I have already done it your salvation is already done your trial is already done whatever things Encounters in your it's already been done you have nothing to do with it just believe what he has already done that's why I titled this remembering the Covenant of Grace in your life because sometimes we forget the grace of God that's right that's right along the way we will just uh oh That's the basis Faith God's determined to save men it was not our determination to be holy to be something it was God's determination that's why you always SP even even if you want to go outside and run away from God if you are a seed of God God is determined to bring you back into his fold that's why it give us a spiritual rest knowing that God is determined when he called us he didn't called us by accident he called us sometimes it's so before the foundation of the word and sometimes we use that word as if in derogatory oh for no that is the real message of the hour that we will know where we came from so that we can conduct ourself in this last days just like the just like the story of brother Braham there was a a a black slave that he he he his action is something different from the ordinary slave so that's why somebody noticed that he was different yes from the rest of the slave and the buyer of the slave asked is he uh something or which no and the slave owner even said that I wondered myself until I realized and I know that he was a prince in the tribe because he knows who he was he act like a prince because he was a prince so that's why he act accordingly because he know who he was just like if we don't know who we are how do we act as the Sons and Daughters of God right that's why the message of the hour is being restored back and we need to have the mind of God and what is the mind of God the word of God in these last days since Jesus Christ is the word of God made manifest and he has the mind of God in him he act according to the Revelation you receed the works that I do is not mine but it was the father in me doing the work expressing the work so if we know who we are then our action will Express God himself yes very good we don't manufacture anything we just believe the word and the word is a seed will just Quicken and manifest itself because if you are the seed of God there is a power in transformation within the seed all the roots all the barks all the fruit all the LI was already in that seed but it take a son which is the spoken word in these last days to Quicken the seed and manifest what in because if you are a Sin Son of God you will manifest the word of God in your [Music] life amen God's determined to save men thank you Lorden that's why we are here because he was determined he make a Covenant if you will I will he break it and another one you will I will he broke it man can keep his Covenant that is why as a human we might try to make a covenant with God they like Lord I will do this I will try my best to be good to please God that's the human natural side of if we know God we need to sometimes we try our heart to be pleasing to God but then you will find that somewhere around the road you will break that Covenant yes because no matter how hard you try right at least we try and sometime we try hard to please God but man can simply keep his side of the contract with God right because this fles right has a nature in itself that it would not always please God that's true that's why there is a change of body because flesh and blood cannot enter into the kingdom of God that's why God will change this body Allelujah because this body will never subject to the word of God true so we have a hard time the greatest enemy is this body yes he has a nature in it so Adam and Noah have already proven that they try hard but they cannot make it and then sometimes when a person fails God they might even think that they're lost of their salvation so we try to fail we try to work hard our way on the Lord and sometimes we fa not only sometimes but most of the times we fail right and sometimes we oh I maybe I'm not a son or maybe I'm not a daughter I commit mistake the problem is that in your mind you are subconsciously thinking in the terms of wrong Covenant in relationship with God right your thinking is in the channel of work based Covenant like Adam and Noah instead of the unconditional Covenant of God's grace amen beautiful that's why we struggle so much yes because although we we receive the grace of God in our life but our thinking is still in the channel of law making do this and do that and sometimes we fail we got discourage yes so God saved Men by his grace under a covenant that's unconditional Covenant oh my never ending that was all of it that was all of it it's just so simple that was all of it Noah Adam and Noah Abraham now that's the reason we are Abraham's children that Covenant cannot be end and will never end because it is unconditional no condition needed God had already done it it isn't because you do something on is because God did something not because you chose God but God chose you and he said Do you believe it if you believe it then it was imputed unto you for righteousness because when Abraham believed the promise of God it was imputed unto him for his [Applause] righteousness Hallelujah so God made a covenant with Abraham and his seed after him because the first Covenant with Adam was based on condition of the day you eat there o the day you die the same thing in principle applies to Noah who was head of a new race of people after the flood so we will notice now that Adam's sin resulted in exposure of his own nakedness so he was afraid to praise God because he was naked and then also that how Noah has seen his getting drunk resulted in exposure of his nakedness and how that Adam and Eve naked had to be covered by God and how that no one his wife's naked and had to be covered by his two son it's just the same pattern Y and then we see that Adam's seed brought a curse upon his seed because Adam is aead of a race so that's why in Romans 5:12 it said wherefore as by one man sined entered into the world and death by sin and so death pass unto all men for all have sin and then C Came Upon Noah's seed also because Canaan was ham seed from Noah and in Genesis 9: 24 he said and Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him and he said cursed be Canan a servant of servant shall be unto his Brethren so if you if we study this scripture pattern closely you will notice that God never intervened to stop the union between the serpent and Eve taking place because they broke the Covenant so God didn't intervene even in Noah's time although he found Grace in the eye of God God didn't intervene but when God made an unconditional with Abraham he went out from their country and CED separate but he brought with him lot yeah that's right it didn't take it a lot maybe just maybe God didn't really mean to separate from some of us thought like that maybe God didn't really mean like that so when he brought lot with him maybe it's okay because it's part of my family but the result was it creates a out of trouble did it take away the promises of God no so they went to Canaan which is the promised land that God promised and God Prosper him but when time come that there was sing if there is a irresponsible husband Abraham was one they were in the promised land but when famine start he was the one who went out from the promised land instead of bringing his family on their knees to pray he went out from Canaan then they went to Egypt and he was afraid so if there is a selfish man number one is Abraham tell the king tell them if they ask you tell them that you are my sister in a human point of you Abraham was irresponsible he is selfish always thinking about himself not thinking about what will happen to Sarah if they ask you tell tell them that you are my sister what can Sarah do but to follow what Abraham tell him to do maybe deep down in Sarah's heart if given a chance I will separate from you you are irresponsible you are selfish you are nothing maybe he's trying to ready a separation divorce paper so when they went to Egypt a bab like I as Abraham or Sarah or something like that so aik the inity the Integrity he was so honest I want to marry oh Sarah but when God made an unconditional Covenant and abik is ready to take Sarah as his wife because of the unconditional Covenant God intervened that's it in Adam he didn't intervene in Noah's time he didn't intervene but when he gave the unconditional Covenant and something happened between Sarah and aimil God interven because he's giving the unconditional Covenant I have already done and I will bless thee so whatever happens in alone his journey God is obligated to intervene to keep his promise in Genesis chapter 20 while aimik was having a good time tomorrow is the day because sah was so beautiful God meet him and he said now therefore restore the man his wife if you read it he is reasoning with God but he told me that he is Abraham was his brother and you know the Integrity of My Heart Lord he is a prophet God identified Abraham as a prophet yes now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee the irresponsible men and thou shall live and if thou restore her not know that thou shallal surely die and all that are dying in other words if you touch that woman you are dead along the road with your whole Kingdom because God is intervening his unconditional Covenant with Abraham likewise we as a Seed of Abraham everything that happens our way praise God that will hinder the unconditional Covenant of God to bless you he will intervene you may have trials issues in your life but God is in the scene to intervene return this man his wife and pray God didn't look the responsible man God didn't look at his selfishness he look at his promise because when he promised Abraham he doesn't care about Abraham that's right he don't care about his past his present what God cares is Covenant with Abraham and he is keeping his word in order to fulfill his Covenant with Abraham we are the Seed of Abraham that everything that comes our way God will honor your faith in his word your prayer is a million times higher than the angel so this Covenant of Grace with Abraham was a very different Covenant of that of the first two Covenant of Adam and Noah it was New Covenant based entirely on God's grace and it has nothing to do with Abraham's good living that's right Amen brother Hallelujah so this is also how God deals with Abraham's sin because Abraham was the head of a faith seed race of people that's right and this is why God will intervene a certain situation in your life Supernatural yes sir amen sometimes you wonder why this happen why this happen why this happen it was God himself intervening in whatever situations you are in which you would otherwise been really messed up this is the grace of God revealed in your life as it was in Abraham's life so understand this clearly we know that Adam was the head of the race that fell by sex and Noah was head of the race of a second uh world that was also polluted by sex so we can see that both of these races came by the flesh by the seed of Flesh through the birth of a womb of a woman but when Abraham was called he was called to be the head of a race that was not going to come by fleshly seed to the womb of a woman but by a faith seed that came out of his faith Abraham Abraham's SP seed a seed that would not come by sex but a seed that would come by the revelations of the word of God which is Christ in our generation so under the first two Covenant God was dealing by ways of Flesh and un conditions of law but under this abrahamic Covenant God now was dealing by way of Faith to the revealing of his word amen and not by sex and law in world but by the revelation of of himself so Abraham was the father of many nations of his faith seed and the revelation of Christ in the hearts of the people so under this third and final and NeverEnding Covenant of Grace God was bringing forth his seed by a faith creation and not by sex amen this is another Covenant that's right not by Flesh and Blood by the faith seed Revelation that's why today even the Muslim hold on to Abraham they claimed that they were Abraham's SE some of the denomination hold on to Abraham they are consider him the father of Faith too and even the Jew they want to identify themselves with Abraham but yet the real one are the Royal seed of the faith of Abraham of the one that came and turned his back to the tent and opened the mysteries of them that it was through identification of Abraham's seed in these days God Came Down In the Flesh and discerned the hearts which is in Sarah which is the Bride of Jesus Christ that's the Royal seed it is his Royal seed that in this day has seen seen the has seen the event take place as our father saw it in this day it's the same pattern amen God came down made himself in the flesh of the person of brother Braham and discerned the hearts of his children in this last day God made flesh once again in this last days hallelujah so Muslim cannot claim Abraham denomination can claim it the you can claim it but you and I the Royal Seed of Abraham can claim the promise of God hallelujah Ephesians 289 said by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God faith is the gift of God Amen not of Works L any man should boast you are saved by God's grace that come by the revelation of the seed word of your day amen and so it is by the grace of God Alone that God has revealed himself to you by the word of your day that is the grace of God the revelation of the word of God of what is happening in our day being revealed unto you that is the grace of God because not everybody can receive what you receive not everybody can appreciate what God has done in our day except you and I as the realy Seed of Abraham and that is the grace of God praise God by sending us the word being reveal in this last day then we can identify oursel in this scripture what Abraham's blessing was it is to with us that's why remember yes the Covenant of Grace in your life and so it has nothing to do with your works of your good behavior no more than it was Abraham's Works forget the works you will struggle by your works just remember the unconditional of Grace and our work with just in appreciation of what he has done in our lives and so we want to reflect that grace of God in our lives by our desire to live the right sort of life that is pleasing to the Lord faith is work expressed the Revelation that you receive will express it in our work not by our own ability not by your struggle but by your faith because the more you eat the word the more you become if you eat the word you will become the word just forget your struggle just eat the word we are on diet to keep us healthy before the changing of our body God requires to eat the food spiritual food in your season God don't require you to work your way into salvation because it has already done you just need to believe it and when you believe it will be imputed unto you for righteousness because blessed is the man that God is not counted that don't count sin in your life you are already Justified and that is the true balance of grace of God in your life and if you fail at times and we will fail many times just like Abraham fails inde did in Genesis 20 by giving his way WIP away to the prevent to to be prated then it was God's gra that intervene a lot of times we fail if we say we don't fail you are a liar let us be realistic we are saved by grace but we still we fail we have failures we have failed sometimes in our life but every time we fail God intervene amen amen thank you Lord because he want to keep his Covenant pure and this unconditional covenant not only in the day of Abraham but until this day because we are the Royal Seed of Abraham the invisible Union of bride of Christ I believe that we are now the wife is already being ready and he said you're going to the wedding in the sky do you believe it not only the wedding but the wedding is already taking place but we are waiting in the sky for the Lord's supper and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own God did it himself you don't put the wedding band on yourself God did it God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the word so he SLI the wedding ban on you there and put your names on The Book of Life what a consolation Hallelujah we just need to Rejoice what he has done in our life we don't need to struggle day by day but we need to praise Him day by day because he's worthy of Our Praise Hallelujah yes sir in the message of Grace he said think of it love and grace is sisters TW sisters you can have Grace without having love they're twin sisters that exactly right before you can have Grace you have to have love this is not just a p Your Love P your love is when you love me I will love you but if you are against me I will kill you that's love but this is what we agap love because agap love is divine love which cover all kinds of sin and there understanding but before you can actually show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't so love and grace is the same thing they're just twin sisters that's all love and grace they you can see one without the other wow for God so loved the word that he gave his only begotten son he shed his grace abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost there's nothing you can do without working one with the other Grace Grace of God is what save us amen that's why there was a default for God so loved the word that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish and habit is for everybody and children born without knowing maybe the grace of God and brother Braham said when a baby is born and he was he died then is still covered by the default the blood of Jesus Christ that's right John 1:17 for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ that's why a few Sundays ago we speaks about when the spirit of truth shall come and the correctness of Truth is will set you free we would simply not know Grace if it hadn't been for law do you agree it the law of God was only given to Moses in order to show what sin was God never intended for us to somehow stand perfect before him by obeying an endless numbers of rules and regulations he knew that it would never happen so in the message law or Grace he said back in the time that God sent down the law and was added to show us that these things were sin but now that Lo couldn't take away sin but it magnifies sin right because if there's no law says you can't do this why it's not it isn't you commit or break that you can't break it because there's no law to break it but when law becomes in effect then sin made manifest then they would say thou shall not steal thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not bear false witness and all these things they did it before but it couldn't be Recon as sin because there's no law against it but when law came in it made the man realize he can steal he can't lie he can't commit adultery and all the Commandment just magnifies but yet that law didn't take away sin it only brought a man to know that it was sin when Christ came Christ came to take away sin Hallelujah so that's why Christ the word of God was made manifest to take away sin Hallelujah that's why in second Peter 3:15 it was the Peter writing to the church account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation he is not willing that anyone should perish but come unto repentance even as our beloved Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him had written unto you so this wisdom came from above it was not wisdom that it was the grace of God coming in him Hallelujah and also in all his Epistles speaking in them of this thing in which some things hard to be understood some of the revelation of Paul is hard to understand he preach about eternal he preached about predestination before the foundation of the world he preached about the coming of the Lord with a shout with a voice with a Archangel yes he speaks about he was caught up in third heaven sure sometimes hard to understand that's why in which are some things hard to understand which they are not they are unlearned and unstable rest as they also do other scripture unto their own destruction so this rest in the Bible sense it means to twist or to turn uh ay to pervert so in other words our conception before the grace of God come of the Epistle of Paul have become like a set of law Like rules that actually begin to work against you in a destructive way instead of causing you to know and grow in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ that is why a person can start to become unstable in their Chris Christian walk in their concept of thinking that it is about laws and rules if you don't grow in the grace of God then you can start in Grace and end up in law and begin to see yourself through the eye of the law and not through the eye of Grace and of a finished work of Christ you start with Grace and you are end with law is it happening in the message Circle it's become rules and regulation that actually it start with Grace in our lives so begin to think that is by your own good deeds and obedient uh set of rules this concept is what causes a person to end up in self condemn state condemn state of mind that is destructive to their own faith and to others and this is what the children of Israel effectively did in the wilderness Journey when they took on the law instead of Grace and that was one of their biggest mistake and it can also be our biggest mistake they forget about the unconditional Covenant of their father Abraham they turn into law and rules and regulations in verse 17 ye therefore Bel seeing you know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness so this steadfastness means confirm or a firm condition of mind so in other words you can go along in your growth as a believer in the knowledge of the word of God but you fail to grow yeah in the grace of God then you can begin to think that it is about rules and then you will become unstable and steadfast in your faith in the fous work of Grace because you thought I cannot make it I cannot do this I cannot do that you forget that there was an unconditional Covenant you don't need to do anything just believe the word of God and in the process of time you will manifest what you believe yes sir amen and then you will become unstable and steadfast in your faith in the finished work of Grace and that is the Trap that the children of Israel fell into they had eaten the Passover which was F after we baptized in the Red Sea for just justification but then they fell away from their standing of an unconditional Covenant of Grace of God made with the Father Abraham that was the final and Everlasting Covenant there is no other Covenant it ends with Abraham the unconditional Covenant and there was no better Covenant to come after Grace and yet they fell into a concept of righteousness by keeping the law amen is it happening in our church in our in the end time message Circle we start from Grace the grace of God we don't do but along the way it seems there's a band of rules and regulations you need to do this you have long hair you need to do this you need to do that it becomes Rule and people are afraid and sometimes if they fail they thought that they were not saved how come they thought that they not saved because it comes from the pulpit the pulpit is the Throne of God and always the grace of God is being spoken out of this Pulpit to LIF your faith higher it is nothing that you have done but he has already done it in the first place and we need to appreciate of God what he has done in our life that is the real grace of God to know his purpose in life that's why Paul said but grow in Grace we need to grow in Grace not only we are saved by grace but we know we need to grow in the grace and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ we need to experience our daily walk with Christ we may fail and we fail a lot of times just like Paul did if I want to do good something is bothering me come on so it's so important to realize the full revelation of the mystery of Grace that has been fully open to us in this age along with our growth in the revelations of the word we need to grow in Grace sometimes it's okay oh I'm predestinated I'm do this and but we need to grow to appreciate what predestination was we need to experience it in our life not like the Pentecost said oh we know that you are predestinated because you go to church every day and my example and he gave me an example when you're riding a train and you fall from the train that means you are not predestinated that was their understanding that's right right and I told him well I want to share the my understanding of predestination yeah go ahead so if you are riding in a train and you fall down God will stop the train and put you back in the train until you reach your destination Hallelujah that is my destination because he has already done it what he has started in the beginning he will end it because he is the author and the finishers of our faith it has nothing to do with it God will always intervene [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah so the balance of these two Wings Will Keep Us walking in faith and in peace and in joy of our Salvation we need to balance our faith message of Grace but according to the prophecy there will come The Headstone and I want you to notice that when The Headstone come the prince is going to cry out the message will cry Grace Grace for it's by grace that we are saved not of Works lest any man should both it's all Grace if we want to boast we want to boast the grace of God in our life that's all the things that we happen to us I am saved and we say I am predestinated don't be ashamed that's because that is your message of the hour that that's why you come this a long way in your journey life because you are predestinated and if you are predestinated your life will follow what you professed because your destiny is already done deal that's good you cannot add anything to it but to believe what he has already done that's why we can see a lot of healing among us because they believe the word of God amen amen and the prophet said healing will soon come that it will will be common among us Amen in our church there are cancer that they being healed everything healed then the other Church there are four stages of cancer and they were healed by just believing the word of God Amen in the Church of brother Roman King there was a sister was already a four stage cancer and he was in a chemotherapy and she said that the chemotherapy has no effect on my life but I believe the word and God Restore for help even his hair was restored and someday it will be common among the Believers that believe the message of are because it's already done deal what can you do but to believe and if you don't believe ask God that give you Faith to believe his word and he will manifest his word amen because that is uncondition that's why in some mod do not forget your benefit what is your benefit God has already done it am whatever situation you are in don't forget get the [Applause] benefits and the message of Grace has Trump under the feet of men until it become disgrace they say Oh I'm great I I am ready eternally sh I can do what I want to do I can smoke I can drink because I am already secure they are Trump right they run over to that grace of God yes but the grace of God is as the prophet said oh I am saved and I predestined I can do what I want brother Braham yes you can yes you can you can do whatever you want but I guarantee you you will not desire to commit sin if you are predestinate your desires to align yourself in the word of God because it is the seed of God that will Quicken your heart and it will align in the word of God we can say just like Jesus Christ the work that I do is not mine but it was the word of God being made manifest unto me remember that he was the first born and we are the next to be born Hallelujah some runs out of it or everything but the true message of Grace remain the same amen and there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God that we are all saved amen sometimes it's so common to hear oh we are saved we are saved by grace it's not common Supernatural praise God amen hallelujah thank you Lord remember that we can never Uno the power of grace of God of what he has achieved by his Redemptive work in our life amen but we can at times fail to live a life that leades up to that Grace do you agree yes why are you so silent amen but we can at times fail to live the life yeah so then our life and action will bring confusion to others and we'll suffer for that in this life because somebody is looking at our life with all the struggle with at times of what Paul struggled with in that when we want to do good evil is present that's true right but like Paul we must know that the real true grace of God is that he has revealed this great mystery of his word to us in this hour so it's not that we live our life trying to follow a set of rules and regulations do this have long hair no makeup long hair clean no it's not about rules and regulations it's about the grace of God in our lives Hallelujah so it's not what we live our life by trying to follow a set of brues but that we live our lives out of an appreciation of the grace of God that's show to us amen and when we make mistakes our flesh fails thank God that we are living in the reality our flesh fails then we must confess our sins to God knowing that there is an unconditional Covenant of Grace that is a million times more yes sufficient than all our sin true we fail and sometimes we fail but we need to confess if we confess yeah our sin before him God is faithful to forgive our sins he knows we fail we fail and so we have so many failures just like Paul he has a turn in the flesh but God said my grace is sufficient for because Grace is more than enough to meet our needs regardless of any challenges and difficulties in our life his grace cannot be always sufficient yes it's unlimited amen it's abundant and all incompass adequately thank you my grace is sufficient for this whatever situations you are in if you fail you have failures you have discouragement in life but you know that you are Sons and Daughters of God God his grace is sufficient for this amen so he said that uh the message what is the work of God I made a remark like that and they said then why did he permit Sin Sin works for his cause that's right that sometimes that I know when God's covenant unconditional he permits everything that comes our way we have failures we can sometimes we backbite sometimes we have some issues I always said that God permits everything that comes our way that is only to express his attributes in our life if you don't have any failure then you can not appreciate him to be Our Redeemer if you have no sickness you cannot magn pray his name to be our healer that's why everything that comes away is not for us to go down on it is to lift up his name in our life and then you become the word made manifest some of us will ask how are you sister I'm okay but she was in a fourth state cancer yeah come on but when ask oh I am okay praise God what is that he is confessing the UNC conditional grace of God and when she start confessing it God is going to perform it just like my just like my wife so simple so he's been uh having trouble with the stop for so many years he lost weight and everything then we went to the doctor and doctor said you need to have a uh you need to check it immediately because the doctor pronounced it that will be a cancer in your throat but we can keep on just believing that doesn't matter that's the opinion of men but the word say I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases from the smallest to the biggest amen even those who were not discovered yet the word of God is already pronounce it amen I am the God heal all kind of diseases the Discover one they soon to be discovered and those who are still following God has already provided for us just like our Salvation it was provided our Salvation was provided before the foundation of the world so that's why the doctor said you need to have the a check so when we went to she was already in the braining table when the look for chicken chicken chick there's nothing in there the Lord God Amen thank you Lord so we need we we don't need to tell it oh I am sick oh no you need to stand strong because you have the word of God in your life H don't be intimidated by what you feel or what the syum tells you but be firm in the word of God because the word of God will always manifest his grace and finan amen prise the Lord thank you Lord we need to Rejoice he saw your failure he saw your shortcoming he saw your depression he saw whatever things in comes in our life God knows about it but it doesn't mean that he don't love you amen even your trials that's sign of his love sir that's why the blessings not only we see things favorable in our way but when it's not favorable sometime we think oh I am being judged by God come on but the bless is a package deal when God gave a conditional Covenant it was a package deal Abraham had so many ups and downs in his life along the way to the Fulfillment of Isaac he had so many ups and downs he has uh he has what do we call this discouragement in his life it seems that he cannot make it it seems it comes in the way that he begin to doubt the word of God and he said Lord Give Me A Sign and God gave him a sign okay we will make a covenant cut this cut this cut that then another thing as he comes along the journey then he he lost his strength to move on then God revealed himself come unto me Abraham I am the El Shai come before me I will sustain you yes Hallelujah I give you strength to move on to fulfill that promise of Isaac amen hallelujah so along the way God is keeping his Covenant to each and every one of us God knows everything amen your eyes is upon this pulpit and God knows about it what's inside those smile what's inside those nding bear God knows about it some may be struggling right now financially spiritually physically praise got maybe a relationship struggle but God knows about it his grace is covered it all because I have already done it you need to go through to that kind of trials in order for you to magnify my name in the midst of your trial we only don't need praise God in our in the goodness but also in the bad times as brother on the bad times is the best time to praise the Lord amen amen when we came from the Philippines for after 15 years it seems that our world is so dark we've been through a lot and it seems that it's so dark that we cannot move anything but we go back to the word of God Amen Paul said everything that comes away is for our own good all things works together for good today that love the Lord amen let your will be done Lord because I just believe your word whatever you want me to do I just believe your word you are our provider you our sustainer you are our strength amen you are our you are the peace and you are everything in our life I just commit myself and let your will be done I made a remark like that and they said then why did he permit sin and sin works for his cause sin works for his cause amen yes sir in God dwells all the great Glory if there had not been a sinner he'd never been a SE that's why we need to experience although we know the reality of predestination but when we bypass our toopan body and went directly to the Flesh in order praise God to be tempted that's why we need to experience being a sinner but but now we realize that we need to experience that in order to glorify God that he was our savior and there had been a sinner he hadd never been a savior in him was the attribute of a savior and sin had to project itself in order for him to be a savior amen hallelujah which is the most powerful a sinner sin or Grace is said Grace of course because Grace is unmerited favor it's nothing you have done or do or whatever in this word it was by God's grace that he chose you so when we realize the word of God that is being revealed in this way the grace of God you can find rest in his promises our struggle along the way will fail but it's okay amen we already know the tactic of Satan he allow everything to glorify his name which is the most powerful a sickness or a Healer well of course the Healer has power over sickness that's right and God if there never been sick person he'd never been a Healer and we see it perform in our congregation amen that God is with us if there never been sick person he'd never be a Healer so there had to be sickness to make him what he is a Healer there had to be sin to make him what he is a savior for sure amen this is just a short sermon that will give us encouragement and remembering the unconditional Covenant with God Amen don't struggle too much cuz sometimes when we receive Grace we end up with rules and regulation and sometime we stumble and sometime we are discouraged yes because the grace turned into laws and regulations but the grace of God is unconditional and it is eternal can we stand to our feet am I I as our musician amen Lord so we are by the grace of God in this last days there is no greater than the grace of God so the last quotation the message of Grace he said before the meeting closes today May there be something happen Lord that would bring your presence so close to the people that they would know that same Jesus that walk in Galilee stands in the midst of his people the same God that made flesh in the person of Jesus Christ is the same God that is in our midst today whatever your needs this morning what he performed then he will still performing it now because he never failed he's the same yesterday today and forever what a blessed people you are don't look at anybody's failure but look at what you can do yes for the glory of God because when we receive the grace of God in our life automatically we become a coworker with God God in one body but now God in many membered body that's why he has greater work thank you Lord because God is in a many membered body if you cannot preach you can pray you become an intercessor yes you are the one that will stop stand between the Gap because as we as the prophet said your prayer is a million times stronger than the angel amen you pray for one another pray for the ministers pray for everybody if you think somebody is struggling your prayer is a million times than the angel and God will honor it yes because you are his body in this generation yes that they would know that that same Jesus that walk in Galilee stand in the midst of his people they might go away from here today with the same assurance that those who came from emos that time when they were on their road back after walking with him all day long talking to him and him talking to them and yet they had little idea that it was him they went away after the crucifixion they walk going back toas and they were discouraged they're talking about the event that happening in the day but without knowing it God was in their midst and God opened the scripture that is being fulfilled in our day and they keep on talking keep on talking keep on talking until finally they invite come with us and they realize that it was God in their midst likewise the same is happening in our midst we may be here we're listening to a preacher but it was he actually speaking to you yes he is still the god that before his crucifixion he is breaking the bread of life and I believe he's still the same tonight or today he's still bre breaking the bread to each and every one of us that we recognize that he is in our midst in his presence in our midst this morning amen thank you Lord he said oh God so many times we are like that we're just walking we struggle without knowing that God is riding in our midst we just don't recognize the presence of the Lord oh remember his unconditional Covenant I will never leave you nor forsake you amen Jesus not only I will be with you but I will be in you hallelujah oh God so many times we are like that you speak to us in the setting of the [Music] Sun and sometimes we look at the Sunset and sometimes it give us sadness but actually God is trying to to speak to you when you feel sad when the sun setting when you see the sky beyond the curtain of life it's just like sadness depression stuck in because it's getting dark but actually it was God trying to speak unto you instead of instead of being said why don't you just kneel on your and pray Lord what is your plan for me today what is your plan for me for tomorrow yes let me let my life be worthy of the Gospel yes what is your plan Lord so let us be sensitive we are not ordinary people we are people saved by grace Hallelujah through the UNC unconditional Covenant of God he didn't chose us just because we are great or somebody or prestigious or something no we it's just by the grace of God yes oh God so many times we are like that you speak to us in the setting of the Sun in the singing of the birds in the rusting of the leaves in the blooming of the flowers in the hymn of the church and we are so little recognized that it's you in the sick room in the hospital many other places you speak to us and we so little realize that it's you remember God has mystery seal up in everything that he made all the natures and everything in animals in in B in life there's a mystery in the eagle of his great wings and his Great Eagle eyesight so that's why the prophet preach about the eagle and stir up her nest because there is a mystery behind those Eagles there's a mystery sealed up in the lion that's why when the seven seal was open you can see there was a white horse there was an ox there was a lion everything because they speak of the spirit in last last day I believe all the Myster is being revealed in our day there's a mystery seal up in the lion and in the ox and in the lamb and in the Dove and in The Great Whale of the ocean and in every animal and insect from antt to the elephant even King Solomon said told us that go to The Ant and consider her ways because there is a mystery sealed in the earth we can take example from the animal how the ant leaves how the Beast how they group together there is still a mystery and God is revealing himself in those things we just didn't recognize sometimes we is so common for us but if we become sensitive to the presence of God it was God trying to reveal something to each and every one of us and may the Lord give us more strength always remember that whoever things that comes your way remember his unconditional Covenant it was the grace of God that comes our way so what is the song It's Already Done Hal
