[43:31] how many years ago was that
[43:35] Justin I thought I'd maybe come and try

[43:47] could brother
[43:51] John you found the same Barber I found
[43:57] sister Becky look at that pretty red

[44:17] day there
[44:20] were ones brought to him in Matthew
[44:25] 19 verse 13
[44:28] then were there brought unto him little
[44:31] children that he should put his hands on
[44:33] them and
[44:35] pray and the disciples rebuked
[44:39] them but Jesus said suffer little
[44:41] children and forbid them not to come un
[44:43] me for of such is the kingdom of
[44:48] heaven and he laid hands on them and
[44:51] departed

[44:57] as the prophet told us he says what we
[44:59] do is we don't baptize little babies or
[45:03] sprinkle
[45:04] them he said because they haven't made a
[45:07] decision but what we do is we take them
[45:11] and we dedicate
[45:13] them and uh give them back to the
[45:17] Lord for a life of
[45:19] service and

[1:01:26] kendi kendi yes kendi kendi yes God
[1:01:31] bless you Mercy
[1:01:35] bless amen when I said I'd do it next
[1:01:38] Sunday I realized I I'll be gone but I
[1:01:41] just wanted to welcome you back he's
[1:01:42] been in Minnesota we loaned him away for
[1:01:45] a few years but he's come back here so
[1:01:48] Jonathan we bless you and welcome you in
[1:01:51] the name of Jesus turn with me if you
[1:01:53] would to the Book of Joshua
[1:01:56] Book of Joshua has some things in my
[1:01:58] heart and we've been talking about the
[1:01:59] leadership of God we've been seeing how
[1:02:02] leadership that God comes in and no
[1:02:04] matter how much that God vindicates a uh
[1:02:08] a man of God or the leadership that God
[1:02:10] uses we always see that the enemy comes
[1:02:12] in and he does everything that he can to
[1:02:15] bring opposition against it now when
[1:02:18] there are true prophets that come false
[1:02:20] prophets when there are true Messengers
[1:02:22] come false Messengers so we know that we
[1:02:25] so we are much uh aware of that and I
[1:02:29] just been looking in the scriptures and
[1:02:31] I've been debating and meditating on
[1:02:34] different things about this leadership
[1:02:37] in the end time and so if we would let's
[1:02:39] just read Joshua 1:
[1:02:42] 1-9 if we could and let's take very much
[1:02:46] notice of the word of
[1:02:48] God Joshua chapter 1 and verse
[1:02:54] one now after the death of
[1:02:59] Moses the servant of the
[1:03:02] Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake
[1:03:05] unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[1:03:08] Minister saying
[1:03:10] notice the Bible says he was moses'
[1:03:13] Minister amen
[1:03:16] amen and this is
[1:03:20] after the death of
[1:03:24] Moses so now I want you to understand
[1:03:27] that after one passes off the scene
[1:03:31] there's a changing of administration
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:34] amen God doesn't just leave his people
[1:03:38] without a voice or without
[1:03:41] leadership thank you Lord so after the
[1:03:44] death of Moses now comes a change a
[1:03:50] transition there's going to be a new
[1:03:52] Administration so God now begins to
[1:03:55] speak to
[1:03:56] Joshua
[1:03:58] Moses my servant is
[1:04:01] dead now therefore arise and go over
[1:04:05] this Jordan thou
[1:04:10] all thou and all this people unto the
[1:04:13] land which I do give thee even to the
[1:04:15] children of
[1:04:17] Israel every place that the soul of your
[1:04:20] foot shall tread
[1:04:21] upon that have I given unto you as I
[1:04:24] said unto MO
[1:04:26] Moses from the Wilderness and this
[1:04:29] Lebanon even to the Great River the
[1:04:31] river Euphrates all the land of the
[1:04:34] Hittites and under the great sea toward
[1:04:37] the going down of the
[1:04:39] sun shall be your
[1:04:42] Coast there shall not any man be able to
[1:04:45] stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:04:49] life as I was with
[1:04:52] Moses so I will be with thee
[1:04:56] amen I will not fail thee nor forsake
[1:05:00] Thee thank you Lord be strong and of a
[1:05:04] good
[1:05:05] courage for under this people Thou shalt
[1:05:07] divide for an inheritance the
[1:05:10] land which I swear unto their fathers to
[1:05:13] give them now stop there for a moment
[1:05:16] because I want you to understand Moses
[1:05:19] saw into the
[1:05:21] land but never possessed it
[1:05:26] true so this new Administration is
[1:05:29] taking
[1:05:31] Moses
[1:05:33] message and his word about what God's
[1:05:37] going to do in this inheritance that
[1:05:39] he's given him and now it's given to
[1:05:42] Joshua to divide them their inheritance

[1:05:50] commission only be thou strong and very
[1:05:53] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[1:05:56] do according to all the law which Moses
[1:06:00] my servant commanded thee turn not from
[1:06:03] it to the right hand or to the
[1:06:05] left that thou mayest Prosper withs
[1:06:08] soever thou

[1:06:12] depart out of thy

[1:06:17] day and night that thou mayest observe
[1:06:20] to do
[1:06:21] according to all that is written therein
[1:06:24] for then th shalt make for then Thou
[1:06:28] shalt make thy Way
[1:06:30] Prosper and then
[1:06:32] shalt have good
[1:06:35] success have I not commanded thee be
[1:06:39] strong and of a good courage that's the
[1:06:42] third
[1:06:44] time Be not
[1:06:47] Afraid neither be thou
[1:06:51] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[1:06:54] thee am withersoever thou
[1:06:58] goest thank you Lord turn with me to the
[1:07:02] book of
[1:07:07] Ephesians the prophet of God
[1:07:09] said the Book of Joshua in the book of
[1:07:13] Ephesians parallel one
[1:07:16] another Ephesians 1 we'll start at verse
[1:07:21] 9 Ephesians chapter 1 and in verse
[1:07:27] 9 having made known unto us the mystery
[1:07:31] of his
[1:07:32] will according to his good pleasure
[1:07:35] which he has purposed in
[1:07:38] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:07:40] fullness of times notice he's talking
[1:07:43] about a dispensation here and what he's
[1:07:46] going to do that he might gather
[1:07:49] together in one all things in
[1:07:53] Christ both which are in heaven
[1:07:56] and which are on earth even in
[1:08:00] him in whom also we have obtained an
[1:08:05] inheritance being
[1:08:07] predestinated
[1:08:08] un being predestinated according to the
[1:08:12] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:08:15] after the counsel of his own
[1:08:19] will that we should be to the praise of
[1:08:22] his glory who first trusted in Christ
[1:08:26] in whom ye also
[1:08:28] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:08:31] Truth The Gospel of your
[1:08:33] salvation in whom also after that you
[1:08:37] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[1:08:39] Spirit of
[1:08:40] Promise which is the earnest of our
[1:08:43] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:08:47] purchased possession under the praise of
[1:08:50] his
[1:08:51] glory wherefore I also after I heard of
[1:08:55] of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love
[1:08:58] unto all the saints cease not to give
[1:09:00] thanks for you making mention of you in
[1:09:03] my
[1:09:05] prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus
[1:09:08] Christ the father of Glory may give un
[1:09:11] you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:09:14] Revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:09:16] somebody say amen amen and the eyes of
[1:09:19] your understanding being enlightened
[1:09:21] that you may know what is the hope of
[1:09:24] his calling
[1:09:26] and what is the riches of his
[1:09:28] inheritance in the Saints and what is
[1:09:30] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:09:33] us word who believe according to the
[1:09:36] working of his mighty power amen amen
[1:09:41] may God bless the reading of his word
[1:09:43] you all may be seated this morning in
[1:09:45] the presence of the
[1:09:53] Lord I'd like to title my sermon this
[1:09:57] morning recognizing the change of
[1:10:00] administration at the end
[1:10:03] time now it's important that you
[1:10:06] understand that you recognize the day
[1:10:08] and the hour in which you live
[1:10:12] amen and I'd like to take a subject this
[1:10:16] morning if understanding the Joshua
[1:10:19] commission under the third
[1:10:23] pole we're going to be looking looking
[1:10:25] at this Joshua commission what it means
[1:10:27] because we find out that it's not a
[1:10:34] man it's a
[1:10:38] Ministry we'll explain this in Greater
[1:10:41] detail as we go
[1:10:43] along there have been different ones
[1:10:45] that have rose up within the message who
[1:10:48] have claimed that they are the Joshua
[1:10:50] and Caleb and you can't make it without
[1:10:52] hearing their message
[1:10:55] and different ones have followed them
[1:10:58] and then we've seen where how the vast
[1:11:01] multitude of those that followed them
[1:11:04] when they hit the
[1:11:06] ditch they also went with
[1:11:09] them and so God help us that we keep our
[1:11:12] eyes focused and centered on Jesus
[1:11:16] Christ not on a man amen no matter how
[1:11:20] great a Ministry he has brother Bram
[1:11:23] says you watch a a man and God begins to
[1:11:26] bless his ministry and if he's not
[1:11:28] careful he gets lifted up pride comes in
[1:11:31] next thing you know he becomes like a
[1:11:33] god to the people and pretty soon
[1:11:36] instead of serving the people the people
[1:11:38] are serving him amen the Bible says if
[1:11:41] you want to be great in the kingdom of
[1:11:42] God learn to be the servant of
[1:11:46] all
[1:11:47] now like I said I've been praying and
[1:11:50] studying from the Bible
[1:11:53] concerning God leading his church
[1:11:56] church and I've always seen where God
[1:11:59] has always wanted to be the shepherd of
[1:12:03] his
[1:12:04] sheep he wants to watch over you he
[1:12:07] wants to lead you guide you he wants to
[1:12:09] take care of you
[1:12:11] amen now we can see from the types and
[1:12:14] the Shadows throughout the
[1:12:17] scripture coming all the way from
[1:12:19] Genesis to
[1:12:22] Revelation that the enemy is always
[1:12:24] attacking the leadership of
[1:12:26] God and Satan knows that if he can Smite
[1:12:29] the shepherd the Sheep will
[1:12:33] scatter if he can't Smite the shepherd
[1:12:36] then he'll send false
[1:12:38] Shepherds and false prophets to pervert
[1:12:41] the
[1:12:41] leadership and cause the
[1:12:44] people
[1:12:46] confusion
[1:12:47] discouragement and the next thing you
[1:12:49] know they'll even perhaps go away
[1:12:57] remember God's spirit will unite
[1:13:00] together a nian spirit a spirit of the
[1:13:06] Antichrist its goal is to divide and
[1:13:10] conquer so when you begin to see split
[1:13:13] after split you begin to see this one
[1:13:15] and that one and taken over and going
[1:13:17] into this direction and that direction
[1:13:19] and breaking uh churches up and causing
[1:13:22] people to to uh become
[1:13:26] uh let's say grouped into little groups
[1:13:29] well we have it and brother Brenham even
[1:13:32] said um uh a quote about that he says be
[1:13:36] careful of those Beaver preachers he
[1:13:40] only says it one time you can put in the
[1:13:42] word Beaver preachers he says that when
[1:13:44] they begin to say it's us for a no more
[1:13:47] in other words they say we have the
[1:13:50] exclusivity of God's revelation I want
[1:13:53] you to know there's only one that holds
[1:13:55] exclusivity of the revealing of the word
[1:13:57] and that's the Holy Spirit and so it's
[1:14:01] it's not under a certain man or a
[1:14:04] certain Ministry although we do believe
[1:14:06] there is a Ministry but that Ministry is
[1:14:08] the son of man it is the really
[1:14:11] revealing of Jesus Christ through a
[1:14:14] third pole now remember that the third
[1:14:17] pole is mysterious brother Brenham said
[1:14:20] now watch that third poll he said it's a
[1:14:22] mystery yes and he says it must be
[1:14:25] revealed and we're going to go into some
[1:14:27] of these things here this morning to
[1:14:30] give us a little bit of an understanding
[1:14:31] of what's Happening even among message
[1:14:34] Believers
[1:14:37] today God wanted to lead his people by
[1:14:40] way of
[1:14:42] Revelation like he did Abel God gave
[1:14:45] Abel Revelation he offered God back his
[1:14:49] Revelation and God received it when Cain
[1:14:54] brought his
[1:14:56] knowledge uh and his desire of what kind
[1:14:59] of sacrifice he thought God should use
[1:15:03] right God refused
[1:15:06] him remember this that God does not
[1:15:09] receive every
[1:15:12] sacrifice in fact Jesus said in that day
[1:15:16] many will come unto me we say did we not
[1:15:19] do this in your name did we not do that
[1:15:21] and he said depart from me you workers
[1:15:24] of iniquity I never knew you that word
[1:15:27] to know means genosis I never conceived
[1:15:30] you you're not my seed if you were my
[1:15:32] seed you would hear my voice and a
[1:15:36] stranger you would not
[1:15:39] follow now we are in another Exodus
[1:15:42] today it's not coming of a physical
[1:15:45] people out of a physical land but a
[1:15:49] spiritual people coming out of a
[1:15:52] spiritual land and I wish to
[1:15:55] type this out here a little bit for you
[1:15:58] this
[1:15:59] morning
[1:16:00] so I want you to notice that certain
[1:16:04] things happen and when they happen it's
[1:16:07] a
[1:16:08] milestone in other words there was a
[1:16:13] junction brother Brenham said after the
[1:16:17] death of Moses
[1:16:19] notice he says now God's
[1:16:22] changing it's a junction yes can you
[1:16:25] imagine what the people thought oh my
[1:16:27] our leader is
[1:16:29] gone Moses who did the signs and wonders
[1:16:33] who was God's voice to us and we weren't
[1:16:37] really following Moses we're following
[1:16:39] the pillar of fire but oh what are we
[1:16:41] going to do now he's
[1:16:44] gone well understand that never does God
[1:16:49] leave his people
[1:16:52] alone he said I'll be with you even in
[1:16:55] you until the end of the
[1:17:01] world God loves to give you
[1:17:05] revelation we see that whenever you have
[1:17:09] one that receives Revelation and another
[1:17:11] one comes along and he is an opposite of
[1:17:14] that which received Revelation so you
[1:17:17] have Abel and
[1:17:20] Cain you have Moses and you have Dayan
[1:17:23] and Kora right now I will elaborate
[1:17:28] later perhaps in the next service or two
[1:17:31] concerning the gains sayings of
[1:17:34] Kora because it's happening right among
[1:17:36] the message today people are saying oh
[1:17:39] Moses take took too much Authority unto
[1:17:44] himself then you have Elijah and
[1:17:48] balum you have Jesus and
[1:17:52] Judas you have Paul and Alexander the
[1:17:56] coppersmith who has done me much
[1:17:59] harm and you have the end time Prophet
[1:18:02] versus
[1:18:04] denominational
[1:18:09] leaders so I wish to take a closer look
[1:18:13] and let's understand what brother
[1:18:15] Brenham says about Moses now we know
[1:18:18] there types and shadows throughout all
[1:18:20] the
[1:18:21] scripture we know that Moses is the type
[1:18:25] of the end time Prophet we understand
[1:18:27] that amen amen but then there are
[1:18:30] antitypes also so we take not only what
[1:18:33] he said here we know that that uh uh
[1:18:37] Enoch is a type of the seventh Church
[1:18:40] age that's going to take a Rapture but
[1:18:43] we also type the bride is going to get
[1:18:45] into an ark the Ark of Safety being
[1:18:48] Christ but then brother Brenham says
[1:18:51] that Enoch is the type of the Bride that
[1:18:54] goes up up and he said that Noah is the
[1:18:58] one that stays here and goes through
[1:19:00] tribulation so we can type it out ever
[1:19:03] Which Way But I wish to just let the
[1:19:05] word speak from itself as the prophet
[1:19:08] gave us his understanding so he goes to
[1:19:13] uh the sermon experiences and he begins
[1:19:16] to say
[1:19:18] this he says now these gifts is what's
[1:19:22] doing that see the systems changed
[1:19:25] the church has led the world ever since
[1:19:27] Martin Luther's time is that right but
[1:19:30] the church age is dying out now that's
[1:19:34] right that's the Moses part it's dying
[1:19:38] out because as Moses failed God so has
[1:19:41] the church failed God I mean the
[1:19:44] denominations you see what I mean how
[1:19:46] many things you understand what I'm
[1:19:48] speaking of thank you friends look Satan
[1:19:51] tries to tell me sometime that they
[1:19:55] don't get it but I know you do see then
[1:19:59] has failed the church has failed because
[1:20:01] it's got to a place if you're not
[1:20:03] Methodist you're not in it if you're not
[1:20:06] Baptist you're not in it if you're not
[1:20:08] being belonged to the Assemblies of God
[1:20:11] you're not in it if you don't belong to
[1:20:13] the Oneness you're not in it if you
[1:20:15] don't belong to this one or that one
[1:20:16] you're not in it how many of you have
[1:20:18] had somebody say if you don't believe
[1:20:20] this way you're not in it if you don't
[1:20:22] believe it that way if you don't believe
[1:20:23] this Doctrine you're not in it well let
[1:20:26] me tell you it isn't a man that puts you
[1:20:28] in it's God that put you in and if God
[1:20:31] puts you in no man can take you
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:35] out amen praise
[1:20:37] God so let's look and see what he says
[1:20:41] pergam and church age Church age book
[1:20:44] now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb
[1:20:48] our promised land is coming in sight
[1:20:51] even as theirs did now Joshua means
[1:20:53] Jehovah savior
[1:20:55] and he represents the end time
[1:20:59] leader and that will come to the church
[1:21:02] even as Paul came as the original leader
[1:21:05] Caleb represents those that stayed true
[1:21:08] with Joshua so you have the end time
[1:21:12] leader and you have Caleb who stays true
[1:21:15] to
[1:21:17] Joshua and he says but Joshua was a
[1:21:21] god-sent prophet and he knew the
[1:21:23] promises of God so he waited for them he
[1:21:27] waited for a clear-cut decision from God
[1:21:29] and when and when the time come to move
[1:21:33] God placed the full leadership in
[1:21:35] Joshua's hands because he had stayed
[1:21:38] with the word God could trust Joshua but
[1:21:41] not the others so it will repeat in this
[1:21:46] day the same problem wow same pressures
[1:21:51] so it's going to repeat right
[1:21:55] so it will take one with Holy Ghost
[1:21:59] discernment
[1:22:01] amen
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:06] it'll take those who can receive super
[1:22:09] ra super natural Revelation from God
[1:22:14] Amen so he keeps going
[1:22:17] on and he the prophet declares in faith
[1:22:22] once delivered to the Saints
[1:22:25] he says denominations are breaking God's
[1:22:28] are
[1:22:29] breaking God's pulling out his people
[1:22:33] getting a church ready Hallelujah the
[1:22:36] very Word Church means the called out
[1:22:39] come out from among it my people be ye
[1:22:41] separated sayith the Lord and I'll
[1:22:43] receive you you can't writing on your
[1:22:46] denomination denomination Church age is
[1:22:49] a little like Moses so now watching make
[1:22:51] the comparison right it failed to Glory
[1:22:56] Moses glorified himself instead of God
[1:22:59] and
[1:23:00] failed but Joshua was right with him all
[1:23:04] the time which has took Israel over to
[1:23:07] the promised
[1:23:09] land see but Joshua and the signs and
[1:23:12] miracles and power that's been with the
[1:23:15] church all the time and you're afraid to
[1:23:18] let loose that's the thing that'll take
[1:23:21] the church into glory in the rapture
[1:23:25] Hallelujah somebody say hallelujah
[1:23:27] hallelujah he said don't be scared that
[1:23:30] means praise our God in the Great War
[1:23:34] Warrior Joshua 1955 Moses a type of
[1:23:38] church
[1:23:40] organization who brought the law so
[1:23:42] forth
[1:23:44] failed why how did he fail glorifying
[1:23:48] himself instead of God is that right so
[1:23:51] is the church today trying to see who
[1:23:53] can build the biggest church who can get
[1:23:57] the best dressed crowd who can get the
[1:23:59] mayor of the city and all the celebrity
[1:24:01] into the church like the Baptist said a
[1:24:04] million more in 54 I don't care a
[1:24:06] million more
[1:24:08] what it's not how many we can get to
[1:24:11] join the church is how many we can get
[1:24:13] in Christ Jesus to believe and submit
[1:24:17] themelves find their positions stand
[1:24:20] like the Rock of Ages at their post of
[1:24:23] Duty and ready oh I hope God just
[1:24:25] settles everybody in here
[1:24:28] tonight just let you know what to do
[1:24:31] this great crisis we're at
[1:24:33] kades
[1:24:36] Baria now for just a
[1:24:39] moment let me rehearsing to you brother
[1:24:43] Brenham came to the church age in born
[1:24:47] in
[1:24:48] 1909 when did the Lan Church age
[1:24:52] start 1906
[1:24:55] brother Brenham CHS 1906 because it was
[1:24:59] the time of the outpouring of the holy
[1:25:02] spirit in ausa Street in Los
[1:25:04] Angeles and what many said was the great
[1:25:08] glossia of the Holy Spirit putting the
[1:25:10] church in order and on and on brother
[1:25:13] Braham said it could not have been the
[1:25:15] great Revival CU he said he said that
[1:25:17] the teaching Reign had not yet come cuz
[1:25:20] the former and latter Reign shall come
[1:25:22] at the end time and we know if you don't
[1:25:25] if you're not t right you're going to
[1:25:26] have a wrong kind of
[1:25:29] harvest so I don't mean to go into that
[1:25:32] this morning but 1906 hold that in your
[1:25:34] mind you have 50 years is what
[1:25:38] Jubilee so the prophet of God is over in
[1:25:41] Los Angeles California ausa Street and
[1:25:45] he's there preaching at a
[1:25:48] convention where the Holy Spirit fell so
[1:25:52] he's ready to take the church over
[1:25:55] he's he is a prophet
[1:25:57] commissioned and you can see now he come
[1:26:00] to a place and he's ready and he
[1:26:02] preaches a sermon I believe if it's if
[1:26:05] I'm correct return in
[1:26:07] Jubilee He said let us return back to
[1:26:11] the word of God and let us have a
[1:26:13] jubilee which is a release but what
[1:26:16] happened he said now America rejected
[1:26:18] the gospel in 1956 here was the prophet
[1:26:21] here he is on the scene here he is with
[1:26:23] a message they came to Katy's Baria
[1:26:26] which is
[1:26:27] judgment and they refused so God now
[1:26:30] watch this God's pulling away from
[1:26:33] denomination and bringing another group
[1:26:36] up another
[1:26:45] Administration and you all remember that
[1:26:47] not all that came out under Moses
[1:26:51] Ministry that came out from Egypt Egypt
[1:26:54] crossed over brother Brenham said there
[1:26:57] was 2 million that come out of Egypt he
[1:26:59] said how many of the original group
[1:27:01] crossed over preached a sermon on it one
[1:27:04] in a
[1:27:06] million now watch this he said Joshua
[1:27:09] and
[1:27:10] Caleb were of a different
[1:27:13] spirit and they followed the word of God
[1:27:15] but all of the old warriors were
[1:27:17] fighting and denominational Spirits got
[1:27:19] in there and he let them everyone
[1:27:22] die and he said but God keeping his word
[1:27:25] is now going to take a younger
[1:27:30] generation and those 19 years of age and
[1:27:33] under God brings them into the promised
[1:27:36] land and the other
[1:27:37] ones don't receive the promise I wonder
[1:27:41] if that's what God is doing
[1:27:43] today if God is dealing with the young
[1:27:46] people and saying hey the others the
[1:27:49] different ones you've seen the different
[1:27:50] ones rise within the message and say I
[1:27:53] got a little this I got a little that
[1:27:55] and they pull one off into this one and
[1:27:57] this Doctrine and this teaching and I'm
[1:27:59] the one you need to follow I'm the voice
[1:28:01] of this last day until it became split
[1:28:05] up split up until uh be we became
[1:28:08] divided just like
[1:28:11] denominations then who do we believe I
[1:28:14] thought this was the message of the hour
[1:28:17] I thought this was what God was doing I
[1:28:19] thought I thought this was it well it is
[1:28:23] but let's go go back to the scriptures
[1:28:25] and you begin to see what happened then
[1:28:27] it's happening again
[1:28:29] today no matter how they saw all of the
[1:28:33] signs and wonders Miriam danced in under
[1:28:37] the spirit with a tambourine we saw
[1:28:40] dancing and all the signs and wonders
[1:28:43] under the coming out of Egypt right but
[1:28:48] the Bible says with many of them God was
[1:28:50] not well
[1:28:52] pleased therefore they were thrown
[1:28:54] overthrown in the
[1:28:56] wilderness Now 1 Corinthians chap 10
[1:29:01] verses 1 through
[1:29:03] 11 moreover Brethren I would not that
[1:29:07] you should be ignorant how that all our
[1:29:10] fathers were under the
[1:29:13] cloud and all passed through the Sea
[1:29:17] Watch this move of God don't be
[1:29:21] ignorant these fathers they came under
[1:29:23] the cloud
[1:29:25] what is the cloud God's
[1:29:27] leadership they pass through the
[1:29:30] sea and we're all baptized
[1:29:33] in unto Moses I want you Moses never
[1:29:36] baptized
[1:29:38] anybody but watch
[1:29:41] this and all baptized unto Moses where
[1:29:45] in the cloud and in the sea the cloud is
[1:29:48] the anointing the footprint of God and
[1:29:52] in the sea was a time a
[1:29:55] separation and did all eat the same
[1:29:58] spiritual
[1:29:59] meat did all drink the same spiritual
[1:30:02] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[1:30:05] rock that followed them and that rock
[1:30:08] was
[1:30:09] Christ but with many of them God was not
[1:30:13] well pleased for they were overthrown in
[1:30:16] the wilderness now these things were our
[1:30:20] examples to the intent that we should
[1:30:23] not lust
[1:30:24] after evil
[1:30:26] things as they also
[1:30:29] lusted neither be ye idolators as some
[1:30:33] of them as it is written the people sat
[1:30:35] down to eat and drink and Rose up to
[1:30:38] play neither let us commit fornication
[1:30:41] as some of them committed and fell in
[1:30:43] one day three and
[1:30:47] 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as
[1:30:50] some of them also tempted and were
[1:30:52] destroyed of the serpent
[1:30:55] neither murmur as ye as some of them
[1:30:57] also murmured and were destroyed in the
[1:30:59] Destroyer now all these things happened
[1:31:02] unto them foreign samples and they are
[1:31:05] written for our
[1:31:07] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:31:11] world are
[1:31:13] come I believe that scripture is being
[1:31:15] fulfilled today
[1:31:18] amen so let us not be idolators
[1:31:22] fornicators EX
[1:31:24] I want to ask you how does a church or a
[1:31:27] man or a
[1:31:30] person commit fornication on Christ
[1:31:34] brother Brenham says these words you
[1:31:36] better better by the Intercourse of the
[1:31:40] mind which is the womb to your spirit
[1:31:44] you add to and take away to the word of
[1:31:47] God he said you're absolutely committing
[1:31:51] spiritual adultery on Christ the word
[1:31:55] it starts out in a spiritual form
[1:31:58] they're Anointed with a fornicating
[1:32:00] spirit it's a Jezebel spirit let me say
[1:32:04] this it's a sexual Spirit unclean
[1:32:09] spirits will usually manifest themselves
[1:32:13] in physical
[1:32:14] uncleanness
[1:32:16] amen starts out spiritual how do these
[1:32:21] people these ministers
[1:32:24] different ones how is it that when they
[1:32:26] get
[1:32:29] off and then just a few years later it
[1:32:33] can become such
[1:32:37] a a reproach to this
[1:32:40] gospel
[1:32:42] how how did it
[1:32:44] happen they went ahead and added to the
[1:32:48] word of God and when they did there was
[1:32:50] a unclean spiritual fornication spirit
[1:32:55] that took them
[1:32:56] over okay spiritual happens first that's
[1:33:00] what happened to Eve eveeve sat down to
[1:33:05] listen woman what happened to
[1:33:10] you well it's the serpent he beguiled me
[1:33:14] beguiled means he seduced her with
[1:33:18] words he didn't take her physically at
[1:33:20] first he seduced her how is the how do
[1:33:25] churches get off of the word you'll have
[1:33:27] some Ministry add to take away next

[1:33:31] fornicating Spirit an adulterous sensual
[1:33:35] lascivious unclean fornicating
[1:33:38] adulterous Jezebel

[1:33:48] of the wrath of her what for
[1:33:51] fornication and the kings of the earth
[1:33:53] did
[1:33:55] three be careful of who you listen
[1:33:59] to be you
[1:34:01] know and as much as I've told
[1:34:04] you
[1:34:07] that most of the nonsense that you have
[1:34:11] on the Internet is just stuff that's
[1:34:14] against the word of God and against this
[1:34:18] message be
[1:34:20] careful of what surfing you do
[1:34:24] on the internet I like to Surf but not
[1:34:27] that kind of Surfing
[1:34:29] amen be careful because what happens you
[1:34:32] go and you listen this one brother and
[1:34:34] down here's a few more and then a few
[1:34:36] more and pretty soon you're off on how
[1:34:38] did it
[1:34:40] happen how did so many people who my you
[1:34:46] you you Church you ran well what what
[1:34:48] hindered
[1:34:49] you well somebody got in here and
[1:34:52] somebody began to so seed and was a seed
[1:34:55] of
[1:34:56] Discord and he began to say well the
[1:35:00] prophet you he made his mistake here and
[1:35:02] over here you know and I'm greater than
[1:35:04] a prophet I have been in a man who
[1:35:08] believes he was the minister after
[1:35:10] brother Brenham I was in his church he
[1:35:13] had a pair of headphones on and he was
[1:35:16] the only one that listened to the tape
[1:35:18] of brother Brenham but he put the
[1:35:20] headphones on and he translated the
[1:35:23] message as brother Brenham was preaching
[1:35:26] in his head headphones do you got the
[1:35:29] picture he's the only one hearing the
[1:35:32] voice and so now he's and he's
[1:35:36] preaching very good by translating as
[1:35:39] fast as brother Brenham can preach but I
[1:35:42] was there and my wife was there with
[1:35:46] me and all of a sudden he he had his
[1:35:50] glasses on he was listening and and
[1:35:53] everything and all of a sudden he put
[1:35:55] his glasses down he stopped the tape
[1:35:58] throws down his headphones and he says
[1:36:00] now there's where I disagree with the
[1:36:03] prophet he said he made a
[1:36:06] mistake so now he was all of a sudden
[1:36:10] causing himself to be above he had
[1:36:12] greater Revelation he had more he had
[1:36:15] greater understanding in fact that man
[1:36:17] told me he says you know what I am in
[1:36:20] the Bible told me this personally I am
[1:36:24] Matthew 24 I am the faithful servant to
[1:36:27] store up the spiritual food that's who I
[1:36:30] am that I am I'm identified in the
[1:36:34] Bible brother Brenham talks about him I
[1:36:37] don't need to go into the names and
[1:36:38] different things but listen there was
[1:36:40] ones raising up while brother Brenham
[1:36:41] was still alive Amen in fact to show you
[1:36:45] he he he had misinterpreted even the
[1:36:49] dream wrong that he was storing up
[1:36:51] natural food brother Brenham told him he
[1:36:54] said no you missed it it's not natural
[1:36:56] food it's spiritual
[1:36:58] food and I told him I said if you were
[1:37:01] to store up the natural food why don't
[1:37:03] you give them that excuse me not natural
[1:37:06] food but the spiritual food why don't
[1:37:08] you give that out to the people he said
[1:37:10] well God
[1:37:11] changed he said it went from an American
[1:37:14] Eagle to a German
[1:37:15] eagle you see all the spiritual
[1:37:20] you tell you what it just takes just a
[1:37:22] few years of you being in the message
[1:37:25] and travel the world a little bit and if
[1:37:28] you haven't met one you will meet
[1:37:32] one they
[1:37:35] are now um remember now I've been
[1:37:38] talking to you
[1:37:40] about that there's going to be a
[1:37:43] Ministry of the third poll let's watch
[1:37:45] perfect faith brother brandham said this
[1:37:48] is coming into that third pull I'm
[1:37:51] believing it now I want to ask you a
[1:37:54] sincere question you that pass through
[1:37:56] the prayer line can you actually believe
[1:37:58] and feel he goes on this is just
[1:38:01] starting to bloom
[1:38:03] now see I did this for a purpose I did
[1:38:07] this for a purpose I'm working out
[1:38:09] something it's taking charge of faith
[1:38:12] and going right back to begin and come
[1:38:15] in to kind of raise faith in a Brank
[1:38:18] bracket where you've never noticed it in
[1:38:21] that way before not a faith but a
[1:38:26] perfect Faith amen built it up here and
[1:38:29] watch a perfect god with a perfect heart
[1:38:32] keep a perfect Promise by his perfect
[1:38:35] word which is sharper than any two-edged
[1:38:38] Sword and the discerner of the thoughts
[1:38:40] of the heart
[1:38:42] what we're coming now to
[1:38:45] Perfection because the people has to
[1:38:48] come to this in order for the r that
[1:38:52] Rapture that's what's holding it right
[1:38:55] it away right now is waiting for the
[1:38:57] church to come into that perfect
[1:39:00] raptured faith I'm looking for it it
[1:39:02] means a whole lot of shaken down for me
[1:39:05] it means a lot for you but together
[1:39:07] we'll make it by the grace of God
[1:39:10] somebody say Amen to that huh don't have
[1:39:14] somebody say Hey you better you better
[1:39:16] get my tapes I tell you what I'm going
[1:39:17] to tell you what that Prophet said I'll
[1:39:19] tell you what the Bible said listen
[1:39:21] there is but one voice that God is je in
[1:39:23] this
[1:39:26] age that is the voice of the seventh
[1:39:28] angel messenger but the voice didn't
[1:39:30] stop with
[1:39:32] him there is another voice there's
[1:39:35] another
[1:39:39] Administration and if you catch that you
[1:39:42] understand it then you will
[1:39:44] see what God is going to do in this
[1:39:51] hour now God had notice Joshua even
[1:39:54] before Moses did so we're going to go to
[1:39:57] numbers
[1:39:59] 27: 18- 23 and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:40:03] take thee Joshua the son of nun a man in
[1:40:07] whom this is the spirit and lay thine
[1:40:11] hand upon Him set him before elzar the
[1:40:14] priest and before all the cas the
[1:40:16] congregation and give him a charge in
[1:40:18] their sight now hold that thought a
[1:40:21] charge in their sight what does that
[1:40:24] mean we'll get into that in a
[1:40:26] moment and thou shalt put some of thine
[1:40:29] honor upon him that all the congregation
[1:40:32] of the children of Israel may be
[1:40:35] obedient and he shall stand before elzer
[1:40:38] the priest who shall ask counsel for him
[1:40:42] after the Judgment of irum before the
[1:40:44] Lord and at his word they shall go out
[1:40:47] and at his word thou shalt come in both
[1:40:50] he and all the children of Israel with
[1:40:51] him even all all the congregation and
[1:40:55] Moses did as the Lord commanded him and
[1:40:57] he took Joshua and setting before El of
[1:41:00] the priest and before the congregation
[1:41:03] and he laids his hands upon him and gave
[1:41:05] him a charge as the Lord commanded by
[1:41:08] the hand of Moses now notice in verse 18
[1:41:11] it says the spirit was upon him in
[1:41:16] Hebrew it's ruach it means literally to
[1:41:20] smell or to perceive
[1:41:24] and make of quickening understanding in
[1:41:27] other words it says this comes from the
[1:41:30] direct Hebrew Supernatural awareness
[1:41:35] wow wow
[1:41:37] ruach this guy has got a different
[1:41:40] Spirit he's
[1:41:42] hey I smell
[1:41:45] something I just hey do you hear that
[1:41:50] yes so he's got spiritual
[1:41:57] awareness a charge verse 19
[1:42:00] SAA point to give a charge to command to
[1:42:04] send as a
[1:42:06] messenger to put or set in order wow so
[1:42:11] I want you to lay hands on him and give
[1:42:12] him a charge in other words before the
[1:42:15] people I want the people to see that
[1:42:18] Moses I'm commanding you to do this now
[1:42:22] do it before elzer the priest and before
[1:42:26] the people and give him a charge let him
[1:42:29] set things in
[1:42:32] order cross referencing that in
[1:42:35] Deuteronomy CH
[1:42:37] 34:9 it says and Joshua the son of nun
[1:42:41] was full of the spirit and of wisdom for
[1:42:44] Moses laid his hands upon him and the
[1:42:46] children of Israel hearkened unto him
[1:42:49] and he did as the Lord commanded
[1:42:51] Moses the this young man Joshua was a
[1:42:55] man of perception he could catch
[1:42:58] things that others
[1:43:02] can't he is a type of the believer in
[1:43:05] this end time message that's got the
[1:43:07] Holy Spirit listen to me carefully
[1:43:11] now whom the holy spirit will lead you
[1:43:13] and guide you into all the truth
[1:43:15] regardless of all the voices throughout
[1:43:18] the
[1:43:21] message he will not only hear the
[1:43:23] message but he will perceive its hidden
[1:43:28] message he'll catch the voice of the
[1:43:31] sign
[1:43:34] amen he will hear the voice behind the
[1:43:37] veil
[1:43:39] yes he will receive Supernatural
[1:43:44] instruction just as Boaz had taken
[1:43:47] notice of Ruth working in the
[1:43:49] field God has taken notice
[1:43:54] of the believer of this hour who has the
[1:43:57] spirit and who is able to perceive
[1:43:59] what's going on am that's right amen
[1:44:04] that makes you a very special class of
[1:44:09] people thank you
[1:44:12] Lord wellow Brother Brenham said the
[1:44:16] initiated to
[1:44:18] whom will be shared secrets and things
[1:44:21] that others cannot catch
[1:44:24] now that doesn't make you high-minded
[1:44:26] and stuff shirted in fact I want you to
[1:44:29] understand the more that God gives you
[1:44:31] revelation of the will of God in your
[1:44:33] life the more humble you
[1:44:35] become because you realize it's him it's
[1:44:39] nothing about me it's all about the seed
[1:44:42] God's watching over the seed and no
[1:44:44] matter how many mistakes I make and
[1:44:46] regardless of how many times like Po

[1:45:06] Watching Over the seed that he placed in
[1:45:08] you and it's everything in your life God
[1:45:12] will use to work together for the good
[1:45:16] even if it wasn't good God will take the
[1:45:19] bad to use to make Gooden then will be
[1:45:23] things in your life there will be
[1:45:25] mistakes there will be issues there will
[1:45:27] be trials and you'll make the wrong

[1:45:31] the wrong thing you'll say the wrong
[1:45:33] thing but God determined to bring you to
[1:45:36] where he is going to bring you God Will

[1:45:45] a m uh
[1:45:48] mediator you ought have someone stand in
[1:45:50] the gap
[1:45:53] cuz God's watching after his
[1:45:55] seed when he made that abrahamic
[1:45:58] Covenant with
[1:46:00] Abraham you find all the
[1:46:02] mistakes that he makes even after the
[1:46:06] Covenant is given but you know what it's
[1:46:09] amazing you go to Hebrews 11 and then
[1:46:12] the Bible says Abraham staggered not
[1:46:15] wait a second wait a second let's go
[1:46:16] back to I take you back to Genesis I'll
[1:46:19] show you he gives his wife away he goes
[1:46:22] into Hagar etc etc this guy's making all
[1:46:25] kinds of
[1:46:27] mistakes and like father like son what
[1:46:30] Abraham does Isaac gives his wife
[1:46:33] Rebecca
[1:46:35] away apple don't fall far from the
[1:46:42] tree but God is
[1:46:44] determined I want you to
[1:46:47] understand it's not about your
[1:46:50] works works is only your faith being
[1:46:55] expressed manifesting that God has given
[1:46:58] you Revelation because without
[1:47:01] works show me a man who has faith and
[1:47:05] I'll show you a man who has
[1:47:06] works okay but it's not the works that
[1:47:09] justify you before God no God says no
[1:47:12] I'm well pleased to see you're catching
[1:47:14] some now I talked to a brother the other
[1:47:17] day and he's really struggling with his
[1:47:19] life and listening to all kinds of
[1:47:21] things and spirit talking to him and he
[1:47:24] says well they told me this and they
[1:47:26] told me that and this demon said this
[1:47:27] and that I said why in the world are you
[1:47:29] listening to all these
[1:47:33] demons I said they cannot read your mind
[1:47:37] but they can put words into your mind
[1:47:39] and can put thoughts into your mind how
[1:47:40] many know that brother Ram said because
[1:47:43] your body is a byproduct of sin Satan
[1:47:46] your first
[1:47:48] Kinsman has got a right to put thoughts
[1:47:51] into your mind but he can't read your
[1:47:52] mind so he waits for you to declare it
[1:47:55] oh I tell you what I'm having a hard
[1:47:56] time all these demons say this and that
[1:47:59] I said why in the world are you
[1:48:01] repeating what those demons are saying
[1:48:03] you're letting them know they have
[1:48:07] your they have your number they have
[1:48:09] your channel
[1:48:12] yes oh I'm having such a hard time this
[1:48:15] demon told me on this and that and why
[1:48:17] in the world you listen to the demon
[1:48:19] amen I said next time you get all of
[1:48:23] these thoughts I said why don't you just
[1:48:25] start praising the Lord why don't you
[1:48:28] just say oh God is a good god oh my and
[1:48:32] I says when you start taking the word of
[1:48:35] God from your lips I said that Devil's
[1:48:38] going to go wait just a second this
[1:48:40] guy's not listening I thought I had his
[1:48:43] channel I thought I had his ear what's
[1:48:46] wrong don't you want to confuse the
[1:48:48] devil listen let me tell you my brother
[1:48:50] and sister when a Believer gets on on
[1:48:52] their knees and praise hell shakes I
[1:48:57] want to ask you then when was the last
[1:48:59] time you made hell Shake I say get on
[1:49:02] your knees more often when your knees
[1:49:04] are
[1:49:05] knocking kneel on
[1:49:09] them tell me say Amen to
[1:49:15] that have faith in
[1:49:18] God when fear knocks at the door and
[1:49:21] Faith answers yes no one's
[1:49:29] there
[1:49:32] amen I want you to understand the Bible
[1:49:35] said that Joshua was moses' Minister he
[1:49:39] ministered unto
[1:49:41] Moses he was a servant a
[1:49:45] coworker he was one who could receive
[1:49:48] instruction in fact when Moses went up
[1:49:51] onto the mount you all know the story to
[1:49:55] get the laws of God he's gone for 40
[1:49:59] days the only one that stayed on the
[1:50:02] mount not in Camp was
[1:50:06] Joshua and he waited for Moses to come
[1:50:09] down and here comes Moses and he's got
[1:50:12] the law on his
[1:50:13] arms his beard is now white his hair is
[1:50:18] white his countenance Shone as the sun
[1:50:21] amen oh
[1:50:24] Moses
[1:50:27] Moses you know Moses talking to him he
[1:50:30] says Moses says we've got to hurry up
[1:50:32] and get down and he says oh I hear the
[1:50:36] sound Joshua is saying I hear the sound
[1:50:39] of war in the camp he said it's not war
[1:50:43] Moses said
[1:50:44] Josh it's not war it's Frolic
[1:50:48] amen they've made a golden
[1:50:51] C I wonder how many golden calves have
[1:50:54] been made in this message and people
[1:50:57] Frolic and dance around it huh and give
[1:51:02] themselves to it till finally when it
[1:51:06] finally comes to an end where do they
[1:51:09] find themselves
[1:51:18] defeated now Joshua does not take the
[1:51:21] command
[1:51:23] until after Moses is
[1:51:28] dead God never has two heads right to
[1:51:32] lead the church at one
[1:51:35] time so so after the death of Moses then
[1:51:40] God begins to speak to
[1:51:43] Joshua the one thing I like about Joshua
[1:51:46] is he never has his own
[1:51:48] message he always says Moses said y i
[1:51:52] you of what Moses said just like Timothy
[1:51:56] the people ask Timothy can't you don't
[1:51:58] you have your own message no Paul
[1:52:03] said I don't have my own
[1:52:07] message in fact I
[1:52:09] plagiarize every Sunday I take from
[1:52:13] another man's message which was the
[1:52:15] message sent in this hour and I give it
[1:52:18] to you in fact the prophet of God says
[1:52:20] you ministers get into these messages
[1:52:23] get into this word of God and he says
[1:52:25] and you begin to eat it so you can take
[1:52:27] it and give it to the
[1:52:30] people that's why I put the quotes up
[1:52:32] there for you to see it's not just me
[1:52:35] it's what he said than
[1:52:42] Lord Joshua had to be commissioned and
[1:52:45] placed as God's man because God changing
[1:52:48] the the
[1:52:49] administration now watch that just
[1:52:52] exactly what was taking place in Sabino
[1:52:55] Canyon brother Brenham had passed all
[1:52:58] his test and now coming to a place of
[1:53:01] adoption he's going to be
[1:53:04] placed he's getting ready to be
[1:53:06] commissioned for a new
[1:53:08] Administration in fact he's up there and
[1:53:11] he's
[1:53:12] praying you all know you've heard it on
[1:53:14] tape so many time I'm up there praying
[1:53:17] I'm praying about this vision and this
[1:53:19] explosion does it mean my death he got
[1:53:22] his hands up and he said something
[1:53:25] struck my hand he said what was it a
[1:53:29] sword he said I looked and I said oh
[1:53:33] I've always been afraid of knives yes
[1:53:36] I'm afraid of these things he said but
[1:53:38] it fit my hand perfectly he begins to
[1:53:41] describe
[1:53:42] it and he says oh a king Knights a man
[1:53:47] with a sword are we together these are
[1:53:50] what he said now what is nighing a man
[1:53:54] is to take a man who's been
[1:53:56] faithful right and I
[1:53:59] King dub Thee I Knight thee with the
[1:54:04] sword un a commission it changes him he
[1:54:08] was just a regular man until he's kned
[1:54:12] right the prophet of God was just a
[1:54:14] regular man until he was kned until he
[1:54:17] was commissioned by the by the king
[1:54:20] himself and he said what is it what is
[1:54:22] this sword that's given to you it's the
[1:54:25] king's sword that's right the word of
[1:54:28] [Music]
[1:54:32] God hallelujah taking size with
[1:54:37] Jesus now as I've done the work of an
[1:54:41] evangelist now how many of you know that
[1:54:43] brother
[1:54:44] Brenham had took a word that God had
[1:54:48] given to him and put it at the
[1:54:50] Cornerstone of brandom Tabernacle yes
[1:54:52] sir
[1:54:53] amen do the work of an
[1:54:57] evangelist make full proof of thy
[1:54:59] Ministry for the time will come when
[1:55:01] they will no longer endure sound
[1:55:04] Doctrine but they shall they shall raise
[1:55:07] up men having itching ears
[1:55:10] right so he says now watch so watch as
[1:55:14] he picks this
[1:55:16] up as I have done the work of an
[1:55:19] advances and here's my plea if that is
[1:55:22] pleasing to God I've done work all right
[1:55:24] trusting I have pleased
[1:55:26] him asking forgiveness for all my
[1:55:30] mistakes then he may be calling me from
[1:55:32] the field of evangelism to be his
[1:55:35] Prophet then if it is I'll leave
[1:55:39] evangelism but if he calls me to be a
[1:55:41] prophet I cannot be an evangelist right
[1:55:44] if I'm an evangelist I cannot be a
[1:55:46] prophet I'm mixing the two
[1:55:49] offices that's where I've always fussed
[1:55:51] about standing on the platform it's
[1:55:54] never been good
[1:55:56] successful God has used
[1:55:59] it but I never thought it was his direct
[1:56:02] will it's been his permissive
[1:56:04] will stand on a platform a vision or two
[1:56:07] will knock you out
[1:56:09] almost and then if you tell this person
[1:56:12] how to straighten up his himself up and
[1:56:14] what to do then the next person stands
[1:56:16] there expecting the same thing and you
[1:56:18] can't tell them unless something tells
[1:56:21] you to tell them right then the other
[1:56:23] people feel like you're a traitor a
[1:56:25] backslider a demon or something because
[1:56:27] you don't tell them what they want to
[1:56:29] know see that's not the office the way a
[1:56:32] profit operates
[1:56:39] yeah who's
[1:56:42] got the
[1:56:44] prayer number
[1:56:47] one they gave out the prayer cards
[1:56:50] number one number one are you are you
[1:56:52] here tonight look on your look on the
[1:56:55] person next to you maybe they can't hear
[1:56:57] or
[1:56:58] read number two number two okay right
[1:57:03] number three you've all heard
[1:57:04] it you know I I get so impatient even
[1:57:08] listening to the
[1:57:10] tape I I would say those who have prayer
[1:57:14] cards one through 20 stand up and get
[1:57:17] over here in
[1:57:18] line
[1:57:20] period if you snooze you
[1:57:27] lose but so now he's doing
[1:57:31] this and he's mixing
[1:57:34] evangelism and a prophetic gift he said
[1:57:37] never been successful are you kidding me
[1:57:41] I thought it was great I thought it was
[1:57:44] very successful H what about the 50,000
[1:57:47] in in in in India and all the thousands
[1:57:51] over in
[1:57:52] African are you kidding
[1:57:55] me he says no he says watch he says a
[1:57:58] prophet don't operate like
[1:58:00] that come out here and tell people their
[1:58:03] name he said what good is it told them
[1:58:04] their
[1:58:08] nameen yes yes your name is Eva May
[1:58:14] yes like it's some big
[1:58:18] Revelation if you don't know who you are
[1:58:21] take out your driver's life
[1:58:23] license I'm not trying to make fun of
[1:58:25] that I'm just saying a lot of those
[1:58:28] people that were just operating gift
[1:58:31] under the first and second pull totally
[1:58:33] missed the third
[1:58:36] pull in fact when the prophet enters
[1:58:39] into a third pole Ministry first and
[1:58:41] second poll took
[1:58:44] off because they said oh this man you
[1:58:47] know what when when when he used to
[1:58:49] discern people's hearts and all of that

[2:03:49] wheel and so this thing comes up to the

[2:04:44] catch a big one too
[2:04:52] God doesn't want the little
[2:04:55] fish and when you get hooked remember he
[2:04:58] doesn't show you the

[2:05:34] me will come to me God is not ringing
[2:05:38] his hands in heaven wondering if he's
[2:05:40] going to lose you oh I fa so bad I I you
[2:05:44] know I'm probably not going to make it
[2:05:46] to heaven I'm not the best why didn't
[2:05:48] God choose somebody better somebody
[2:05:50] smarter somebody who's more obedient why
[2:05:52] didn't he why do I always have to why
[2:05:56] me well it's because you're
[2:05:59] elected before you were born before you
[2:06:02] came into this world neither having done
[2:06:05] good or evil God watching over that seed
[2:06:08] do he place inside of you so he's not
[2:06:11] looking for anyone else but
[2:06:14] himself why because the seed is his
[2:06:18] representation that's him in seed form
[2:06:21] Hallelujah absolutely amen glory to God

[2:12:42] this whole time the presence of God got
[2:12:48] very okay God bless you
[2:12:55] you could just tell the anointing of God
[2:12:56] was
[2:12:58] there so when we were
[2:13:08] done I ask him
[2:13:10] Billy why did you hold
[2:13:15] me why didn't you let me go because you
[2:13:18] kept talking
[2:13:26] he looked at
[2:13:28] me
[2:13:31] really you don't
[2:13:33] know he didn't have to say another thing
[2:13:36] I knew right then I
[2:13:39] said I said Billy was was the angel
[2:13:45] there he just shook his
[2:13:48] head I said wow
[2:13:54] the angel was there in the
[2:13:57] meeting and Billy Paul was holding
[2:14:01] me that doesn't make me anything
[2:14:05] special I do say
[2:14:08] this that there are several
[2:14:11] times during the course of my Ministry I
[2:14:15] felt a very very sweet presence
[2:14:21] I believe he comes by
[2:14:25] amen doesn't make me anybody
[2:14:33] special looking away to Jesus I just
[2:14:36] want to read
[2:14:39] this I'm on page eight I've got 16 or 18
[2:14:44] pages I told Stephen McNeely in the back
[2:14:47] room I said I just I don't want to go
[2:14:50] too fast
[2:14:53] I just want
[2:14:55] to find the mind of
[2:14:59] God here it is looking away to
[2:15:02] Jesus
[2:15:04] 63 now I'm going to say something to you
[2:15:07] now that I haven't said all
[2:15:10] along that
[2:15:13] is the thing that I've looked forward to
[2:15:15] for so long or at least many years four
[2:15:18] or five years or maybe longer the third
[2:15:20] poll has now been
[2:15:23] Vindicated and I'm sure you all know
[2:15:25] what it is now remember there'll never
[2:15:28] be any impersonations that cuz it can't
[2:15:31] be it cannot
[2:15:33] be now it's in existence and I I am
[2:15:38] warned of this that soon right at this
[2:15:41] time now it's just happened so it could
[2:15:44] identify its presence among you
[2:15:47] see but it will not be used in a great
[2:15:50] way
[2:15:51] until this Council begins to tighten
[2:15:54] up and when it
[2:15:57] does the Pentecostals and for and so
[2:16:00] forth can almost impersonate anything
[2:16:02] that could be done but when that time
[2:16:05] comes when the squeeze comes down then
[2:16:08] you'll see what you've seen
[2:16:11] temporarily be manifested in the
[2:16:14] fullness of its
[2:16:18] power he said what you've seen temp
[2:16:21] temporarily in other words I'm coming
[2:16:23] into it I I've been holding back I've
[2:16:25] been I've been waiting to see if you're
[2:16:27] spiritual enough if you're spiritual you
[2:16:29] should have caught that the other day
[2:16:31] this is that third pole remember Sabino
[2:16:34] Canyon the sword what is it this is the
[2:16:37] Vindication of your ministry this is the
[2:16:40] third pole are you following
[2:16:45] me now I must continue in a just as I
[2:16:48] was commissioned first I must continue
[2:16:50] on therefore
[2:16:51] you've had the word you know what to
[2:16:53] look for how to stand I must continue on
[2:16:55] in evangelism and friends of mine keep
[2:16:59] still and just keep moving on for the
[2:17:01] hour is approaching swiftly see that
[2:17:03] when something is going to be done you
[2:17:06] might see some odd little things happen
[2:17:08] for me nothing simple I don't mean that
[2:17:11] but I mean something odd to that regular
[2:17:14] Trend because what I've reached to now
[2:17:17] in the ministry I'm dropping back here
[2:17:19] watching the spot and waiting for the
[2:17:21] time to to use it but it's going to be
[2:17:25] used and everyone knows that for as
[2:17:29] certain as the first was identified so
[2:17:31] has the second been identified and if
[2:17:34] you'll think real closely you who are
[2:17:36] spiritual as the Bible said he's here's
[2:17:39] to him who has wisdom the third is
[2:17:42] properly identified see we know where it
[2:17:46] is so the third pull
[2:17:51] is here
[2:17:54] amen musicians have you
[2:17:59] come okay I've got so much but I just
[2:18:02] want to then lay a foundation for where
[2:18:04] I'll go on the next
[2:18:07] service Joshua's first commission was to
[2:18:10] cross over
[2:18:14] Jordan in the time when the Jordan was
[2:18:18] uncrossable why it was overflowing its
[2:18:20] banks
[2:18:22] but whenever God tells you to do
[2:18:24] something he'll make the impossible
[2:18:27] possible that's
[2:18:32] right so his first commission move by
[2:18:36] faith and he says Let The Ark and the
[2:18:39] ministry go before you and he said and
[2:18:42] as soon as their feet Touch the Water up
[2:18:44] to their
[2:18:46] ankles the Jordan
[2:18:52] sometimes you got to get your feet wet
[2:18:55] that's
[2:18:56] right before the wat's
[2:19:00] part you understand you walk by faith
[2:19:05] not by
[2:19:07] sight You'll Never Walk On Water till
[2:19:11] you get out of the boat
[2:19:21] we know that we shall possess the gates
[2:19:23] of the
[2:19:24] enemy the third poll is an adoption
[2:19:29] Ministry it's a placing Ministry yes
[2:19:33] when the true bride catches a true
[2:19:35] revelation of who she
[2:19:37] is and what she stands
[2:19:41] for then and only then will she stand as
[2:19:44] an invincible Army
[2:19:52] from who am I to who I
[2:19:56] am I can see
[2:19:59] now who I
[2:20:01] am thank you
[2:20:04] Lord he will place them by Revelation
[2:20:07] into their
[2:20:09] inheritance Benjamin over here ishar
[2:20:15] over here Judah over here going placing
[2:20:19] them into their position you know what
[2:20:22] the Holy Spirit does with you he places
[2:20:24] you in your position it's not given to
[2:20:28] you by man the holy spirit
[2:20:33] amen thank
[2:20:36] you then he took them to
[2:20:39] gilgal the place of the
[2:20:44] [Music]
[2:20:46] forkins and I'll save this for next
[2:20:48] service but remember what he does
[2:20:52] the word of the Lord comes and says
[2:20:54] circumcise Israel the second
[2:20:56] [Music]
[2:20:58] time
[2:21:01] what how do you
[2:21:03] circumcise the second time that's what
[2:21:07] he asked
[2:21:09] God and understand this he said no he
[2:21:12] said you've been 40 years in the
[2:21:14] wilderness you have had so many
[2:21:17] children that have been born and none of
[2:21:19] them have been C
[2:21:21] [Music]
[2:21:22] circumcised he said I want you to
[2:21:24] circumcise all of
[2:21:26] those who are the children of the
[2:21:29] Wilderness and I just wonder how many
[2:21:32] within this
[2:21:33] message have been serving God and
[2:21:36] thinking that everything is okay and I
[2:21:39] ask you right now have you received the
[2:21:41] Holy
[2:21:43] Ghost since you
[2:21:45] believe yeah well I thought I I I I I
[2:21:48] thought that if I just say Amen to all
[2:21:50] the word of God I've got the Holy Ghost
[2:21:53] brother Brenham said that only proves to
[2:21:55] me one thing that's that you can
[2:21:58] read amen no no no no have you received
[2:22:01] the Holy
[2:22:03] Ghost has the circumcision of the spirit
[2:22:06] because you know what God doesn't seal
[2:22:08] you to the time of your Eternal
[2:22:12] destination until the boxar is in
[2:22:16] order do you understand that
[2:22:20] not when you just first start

[2:30:48] maker God will make a way for you in
[2:30:51] fact he already made the way you just
[2:30:54] have to accept it you have to be willing
[2:30:57] to accept the way that he has
[2:31:00] made and
[2:31:02] irregardless of all of your faults and
[2:31:04] failures guess what he chose you he

[2:31:36] came across your path you know what
[2:31:38] you're predestinated to it this is your
[2:31:41] message this third pole it's all about
[2:31:44] the mystery and guess what you're a part
[2:31:46] of that great mystery you're the mystery
[2:31:49] that is unfolding Malachi 4 has already
[2:31:52] done his
[2:31:53] work Revelation 10:7 has already sounded
[2:31:57] but now there's a time of Revelations
[2:32:00] 108 take the book this is our day this
[2:32:04] is our message
[2:32:05] [Music]
[2:32:07] now there is a voice still in the land
[2:32:10] that's the and he said there will be a
[2:32:12] people who under their Prophet will be
[2:32:15] the final voice to the final age some
[2:32:19] body say Amen to that God Will Make A
[2:32:24] Way God will make a
[2:32:29] way where there seems to be no
[2:32:35] way he works in
[2:32:38] way we canot
[2:32:42] see we
[2:32:44] will our
[2:32:48] way Jesus see my
[2:32:53] eyes me clely to

[2:33:28] Father thou will make a
[2:33:33] way you have provided a way for us in
[2:33:36] this end
[2:33:39] time and sometimes father it becomes so
[2:33:42] mysterious
[2:33:44] and maybe sometimes hard to grasp and
[2:33:47] understand but we don't need to
[2:33:50] understand it we just need to say Amen
[2:33:52] to it amen Mary pondered at the words of
[2:33:57] the Angel and his
[2:34:00] salutation and that angel could not
[2:34:03] leave until Mary had her will agree with
[2:34:08] God's Will and say be it unto me
[2:34:12] according to thy will then the angel had
[2:34:16] done his
[2:34:18] commission revelation Ians 10:7 could
[2:34:21] not go off the
[2:34:23] scene until he had preached a message
