[26:42] just read a passage of scripture just
[26:44] before you're seated.
[26:49] Galatians the 4th
[26:57] chapter I want to read in uh I want to
[26:59] read in verse
[27:03] one Galatians chapter
[27:08] 4 verse
[27:11] one boy it's good to see everybody so
[27:14] many
[27:15] friends and
[27:18] Uh just so many I just love I I love
[27:21] coming here. I I uh I always I hit an
[27:25] in-n-out within 15 minutes of touching
[27:27] down and uh you know and then just to
[27:30] see all of you. Uh it's just so
[27:32] wonderful. Uh I hope you're as happy to
[27:35] be in church tonight as I am. Uh it's
[27:37] good to see you all. Looking forward to
[27:38] spending so much a lot of time together
[27:41] at the camp. So, if I don't get to see
[27:42] all of you at the camp, um I I hope we
[27:46] get to at least see each other a little
[27:47] bit tonight. And um boy, it's good to
[27:51] see so many friends. Galatians the 4th
[27:53] chapter in verse
[27:57] 1. Now I
[28:00] say that the heir, as long as he is a
[28:04] child, defereth nothing from a servant,
[28:08] though he be the Lord of all.
[28:11] but is under tutors and governors until
[28:15] the time appointed of the father. Even
[28:18] so, we when we were children were in
[28:22] bondage under the elements of the world.
[28:25] But when the fullness of time was come,
[28:28] God sent forth his son made of a woman,
[28:31] made under the law, to redeem them that
[28:34] were under the law, that we might
[28:36] receive the adoption of sons. Amen.
[28:40] Hallelujah. And because ye are sons, God
[28:42] hath sent forth the spirit of his son
[28:45] into your hearts, crying,
[28:48] Abba, Father,
[28:50] wherefore thou art no more a servant.
[28:54] But a son, and if a son, then heir of
[28:58] God through Christ. Let's pray. Heavenly
[29:02] Father, we thank you uh so much for
[29:05] tonight. We thank you for these few
[29:07] moments that we have. We've gathered
[29:09] together in the name of the Lord Jesus
[29:11] Christ. Lord, we believe that you are
[29:13] here not because of uh a feeling alone
[29:20] but because you said you would be here.
[29:23] You would be among those who are
[29:24] gathered in your name. We have done that
[29:27] and we believe that you are here. So,
[29:29] it's upon that belief that we commit
[29:31] this service into your hands. May you do
[29:34] the speaking. I'm here and I remove
[29:37] myself as much as I know how. And I pray
[29:40] that everybody in this room being here
[29:43] would remove themselves so that you
[29:45] could bring our hearts and our minds
[29:47] subject to the word of God. Amen. May
[29:50] you have the freedom to do that and to
[29:52] move in our midst. We love you. We thank
[29:55] you. And in the name of the Lord Jesus
[29:57] Christ, do we pray. Amen. And amen. You
[29:59] can have your
[30:01] seats. Thank you for standing with me.
[30:06] Uh I am uh happy to have sister Sarah
[30:10] here with me and um we are uh just happy
[30:13] to be going to the camp and really
[30:15] looking forward to that. Uh if you're
[30:16] not going to the camp and I think you I
[30:18] think you mentioned this, but if you're
[30:19] not going to the camp, be in prayer for
[30:20] the camp. Uh I think it's it's important
[30:23] if you are going to the camp, you also
[30:25] be in prayer for the camp. Uh that
[30:27] you'll receive what the Lord would um
[30:29] would have for you. Uh I think it's a uh
[30:33] a very um important moment in time when
[30:37] you go to a camp as a young person. Um I
[30:41] don't think you should live camp to camp
[30:42] spiritually.
[30:44] Uh I think you should have more than
[30:46] that. You shouldn't have to go to a camp
[30:48] to feel like you are spiritual.
[30:51] But since you are going then pray that
[30:54] the Lord would touch you in a mighty
[30:55] way. Amen. and that he would equip you
[30:57] with what you need to go back and live
[31:00] uh the most effective life for the Lord
[31:02] that you possibly can. Amen. Uh because
[31:04] camps are wonderful, but it's in the
[31:06] everyday living. It's in Brother Bam
[31:09] said, it's in the harsh realities of
[31:10] everyday living, the ruggedness of
[31:12] everyday living. Uh that's where your
[31:14] testimony is made. Uh it's in the day in
[31:18] and the day out. It's in the monotony of
[31:20] every moment that God gives you. And uh
[31:25] I I think you should pray for that. So
[31:28] going into the camp, don't just pray for
[31:30] that moment alone. Say, "Lord, help me
[31:32] beyond the camp." Uh that's what that's
[31:34] what your goal should be. Not just the
[31:36] camp alone, but beyond that. Lord, help
[31:38] me to come back, live an effective life.
[31:40] So be in prayer whether you're going or
[31:42] whether you're not. Um and then uh I
[31:44] just want to say thank you, brother Ron,
[31:46] for in in inviting me to speak. It's
[31:48] such an honor. Um really appreciate
[31:50] brother Ron and Sister Sandy and uh um
[31:54] I've known them pretty well all my life
[31:56] I guess or they've known me pretty well
[31:58] all my life and uh uh it's just such a
[32:00] good good thing to be here with them. So
[32:03] thank you and may the Lord bless each
[32:05] and every one of you.
[32:08] I uh I always try to be myself when uh
[32:12] when the Lord has me um I still to this
[32:15] day don't understand why the Lord
[32:16] wouldn't have me behind anyone's pulpit.
[32:20] Um but he does. And so seeing that I'm
[32:23] here, I'm just going to be myself. I'm
[32:25] going to be what the Lord has made what
[32:26] the Lord has brought me to be to this
[32:28] point. Uh and I'm I'm going to be that.
[32:31] But tonight, it's a Wednesday night. I
[32:33] know for a fact we're all running on 30%
[32:35] of our brain capacity. So, it's tired.
[32:37] You're tired. Um, uh, uh, I think you
[32:41] said it best. It'd be good to just be at
[32:42] home and rest, but, you didn't make that
[32:44] decision. You're here. So, being that
[32:46] you're here, being that you're in the
[32:47] room, let's just press into the word of
[32:49] God. And, uh, I I'll try to be brief.
[32:52] I'll try to be um, as simple as I can so
[32:54] that my 30% can grasp it, but uh, let's
[32:58] just lean into the presence of the Lord.
[32:59] Is that okay?
[33:02] I uh I was thinking about this just a
[33:05] couple weeks ago and uh this this topic
[33:09] came on my heart for tonight and
[33:14] uh I there there is a part of every
[33:20] single one of
[33:22] you in this room. Every single one.
[33:26] Brother Random referred to it as the uh
[33:28] the hidden man.
[33:31] uh the hidden person, the hidden hidden
[33:33] woman, and that's the real you.
[33:37] Every single one of you in this room,
[33:40] there is a part of you, the vast
[33:43] majority of you
[33:46] that we do not see, right? Your spouse
[33:49] may not see, your children may not see,
[33:50] your friends may not
[33:52] see. It's the real you. It's that inner
[33:56] life that nobody can really fully see
[33:58] from an ex exterior standpoint. That's
[34:01] good. It's uh it's the it's the person
[34:05] way down deep.
[34:08] And you may not even fully understand
[34:10] that person, right? But that's the real
[34:12] you. The scripture says in first Peter
[34:14] chapter 3, but let it be the hidden man
[34:18] of the heart. Amen. Continues to say,
[34:22] which is
[34:24] in the sight of God of great price.
[34:28] It's the hidden man of the heart. It's
[34:30] the hidden woman of the heart. Wow.
[34:35] And uh it's there where your thoughts
[34:38] live. It's there where you're um it's
[34:41] there where you dwell most of the
[34:44] time. That hidden man of the heart,
[34:46] hidden woman of the heart. the the
[34:48] Hebrews uh they really didn't have a
[34:51] word and I find this interesting but
[34:54] they didn't really have a word for
[34:56] brain they referred to uh all thinking
[35:01] feeling um will uh decision making all
[35:06] of it was attributed to the heart which
[35:09] which was the lav so they didn't really
[35:12] have a term for the brain it was all all
[35:14] of it was referred to as the heart guard
[35:17] your heart for out of it are the issues
[35:19] of life. Who can your your heart is
[35:22] deceitfully wicked who can know it? So
[35:25] whenever it's referring to that person
[35:27] or that inner being that inner uh deep
[35:32] hidden person that you
[35:35] are refers to the heart
[35:38] and um that's that's the part of you
[35:42] that God is after. Yeah. And it's not
[35:46] just your church smile. It's not just
[35:48] your outward performance, right? Uh and
[35:51] I I'm I'm I am going to speak to you
[35:54] tonight from a a a just a personal way
[35:57] if that's okay. So I'm not talking at
[36:00] you. I'm I'm giving you my personal
[36:02] story, if you will. And that that person
[36:06] deep down that all of you are that we
[36:08] all are. That's who God wants. Yes. you
[36:13] can act the part on on from an exterior
[36:16] standpoint. Sometimes you have to put on
[36:19] a good face. You're just uh you want you
[36:21] come to church and you put on a smile
[36:23] and that's the appropriate thing to do.
[36:24] That's the polite thing to do. But
[36:27] there's there's a a part of you
[36:31] um that I don't know where you're at.
[36:36] Your pastor may not know where you're
[36:37] at. Your spouse may not even to a full
[36:40] extent know where that deep down person
[36:43] is tonight.
[36:46] Each one of you, you could be
[36:50] um and
[36:52] uh just be honest with yourself as I'm
[36:54] speaking to you, but that person could
[36:57] weigh lay a awake at
[37:00] night. That person may have a lot of
[37:02] questions. that person may be so
[37:05] dissatisfied and disgusted with
[37:08] themselves that they don't know what to
[37:10] do.
[37:12] So that deep down person on the inside
[37:14] that every single one of you have
[37:16] irrespective of age I don't care how old
[37:19] you are I don't care how young you are
[37:21] every single one of you know you you
[37:23] know what I'm talking about there's that
[37:25] deep down person that hidden life nobody
[37:28] knows what it is nobody can see it but
[37:30] you do
[37:32] you hear what plays out at night you uh
[37:36] in your
[37:37] thoughts you you have to carry that um
[37:42] inadequate feeling around. So, I don't
[37:45] know where you are tonight. You might be
[37:47] just fine, but maybe you feel apathy.
[37:51] You just feel in a place where you're
[37:52] like, I just I
[37:54] don't I don't I don't have a I don't
[37:57] have a drive. I don't have purpose. I
[37:59] don't feel like I'm going towards
[38:00] something. You know, I'm doing work.
[38:03] I've got kids. I've got all these
[38:04] different things or I've just got I've
[38:06] got life and um you know, all these
[38:09] different things. But you you may not
[38:10] just you you may not feel
[38:13] uh
[38:16] satisfied. And I think if you're in a
[38:20] tough place like that, there may be a
[38:22] part of you that feels overwhelmed
[38:25] as well. I think just because of the
[38:28] pressures of the life, because uh of the
[38:30] life that we live, the economy that we
[38:32] live in, the world we live in, news, uh
[38:36] there is a pressure. We understand that
[38:39] there's a pressure upon everybody. We as
[38:41] the bride of Jesus Christ, we have a
[38:43] place to let it off.
[38:45] Um, but we h there is a pressure that's
[38:48] on every single one of you. And you feel
[38:51] that. But I'm talking about more than
[38:53] that. I'm talking about even on a
[38:56] spiritual warfare level where you feel
[38:59] um you might feel dirty
[39:03] on the inside. you look great
[39:06] tonight, but I'm talking about when you
[39:08] go home, when you're driving to work in
[39:10] the morning, that
[39:13] person. And I I want you to
[39:17] um uh I want you to think about that
[39:21] tonight because
[39:25] I just in my own life, I'm at a place
[39:29] where I I I want a real vitality
[39:36] and
[39:37] life and
[39:39] relationship, more importantly,
[39:42] fellowship. Amen. with the person of the
[39:44] Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:46] Amen. I am at a place where I I don't I
[39:49] don't want to go through any motion mo
[39:52] just the motions to do the things
[39:55] uh and and then to go home and feel out
[39:58] of place to feel lost to feel like I'm
[40:02] not sure like I'm not strong like I'm
[40:05] not where I need to be even though I may
[40:07] be where I need to be. just to have that
[40:10] feeling of loneliness surrounded by
[40:13] people. Yeah.
[40:15] I don't want that. Now, sometimes the
[40:18] Lord can allow us to be in a place like
[40:20] that to deal with us, but I I don't want
[40:23] the enemy to wreak havoc in my mind
[40:26] anymore.
[40:28] I'm I'm done playing uh uh with the
[40:30] enemy and and letting him mess around
[40:33] with me deep down. I'm tired of it.
[40:38] [Music]
[40:39] I I don't want to feel empty.
[40:45] Uh when I'm when it's just me.
[40:49] I want to feel life.
[40:52] I want to feel the vitality that comes
[40:55] with living in the resurrected power of
[40:58] Jesus Christ. Amen. And I am I am
[41:01] telling you
[41:03] tonight, it is absolutely available to
[41:06] every single one of you. I don't care
[41:08] where you've been. I don't care what is
[41:10] going on deep down inside. You can have
[41:14] a real fellowship with the person of the
[41:18] Lord Jesus Christ. You can have a real
[41:21] life. You can you can know with
[41:24] certainty and with assurance the purpose
[41:27] that God has called you to. And you can
[41:29] walk in it in such confidence that you
[41:32] have the ability to claim the and and
[41:36] use the authority that God has given you
[41:39] to say, "Satan, get thee behind me." You
[41:43] you you are in a place where you can do
[41:47] that. It is available to you. So if
[41:50] where you are right now isn't that you
[41:54] can have it. Thank you, Lord, Amen.
[41:58] beautiful in this passage in Galatians
[42:00] chapter 4. My mind was just so drawn and
[42:05] my heart was so drawn to this statement
[42:07] in verse 7. Wherefore thou art no more a
[42:11] servant but a son.
[42:15] Amen. If you're I I don't think it's
[42:18] it's good to be living like a servant
[42:22] anymore
[42:25] because you are not a servant anymore.
[42:27] That's right. And so you don't a
[42:30] servant's
[42:31] mindset is uh many things but it can be
[42:36] uh maybe if I don't do enough
[42:40] uh then he won't be pleased with me. If
[42:44] I don't do enough then he won't be
[42:46] pleased with me. if I don't if I um uh
[42:49] you know it it keeps you on edge living
[42:53] and thinking and acting like a servant.
[42:57] It keeps you on edge. Amen. Because it's
[43:00] on it's on a performance basis. So I've
[43:03] got to ah I've got to I've got to I
[43:05] didn't do that and I I did do this and
[43:07] um so therefore the Lord should be
[43:09] pleased with me because I did that. And
[43:12] your thinking and your attitude and your
[43:14] behavior is that of a servant. A servant
[43:19] never feels secure. Because
[43:22] everything their their place in the
[43:24] house is absolutely based on what they
[43:27] do. Amen. So when if you're in in your
[43:31] hidden person and you're thinking and
[43:34] you're by yourself and you're living on
[43:36] the basis of what you can do, then Satan
[43:39] is going to meet you in that place and
[43:41] say, "You don't do enough." So
[43:43] therefore, you're not worth anything.
[43:46] And then that's naturally going to
[43:47] spiral you into a worse place.
[43:52] And if you're all if you're thinking
[43:53] like, "Well, I've got to do this." then
[43:56] you're already in a in a difficult place
[43:59] because if you the Christian life um I
[44:03] was talking to somebody the other the
[44:04] other day and they were saying well you
[44:05] know I've done all these bad things and
[44:07] I I just I need to get my life in order
[44:09] and I said well well you know that that
[44:10] won't save you and they said yes but
[44:14] what are you referring to and I said
[44:15] well bad things are bad things you
[44:17] shouldn't do bad things but if you don't
[44:20] do those bad things do you know that
[44:22] that won't save you that won't keep you
[44:24] from judgment day. It takes the Holy
[44:27] Spirit. It takes the baptism of the Holy
[44:29] Spirit. It takes the life of Christ to
[44:31] keep you from judgment day. So, you do
[44:32] all these bad things. Don't do them. But
[44:35] if you don't do those bad things, do you
[44:37] realize that you'd still not be saved?
[44:39] Right? It's not a worksbased faith.
[44:41] Every other religion in on planet Earth
[44:44] is by some element of works. Hinduism,
[44:46] Buddhism, it's all worksbased. I do
[44:49] these things and I feel this thing. That
[44:51] is not how the Lord came to you. It was
[44:54] by uh your it's by grace that the Lord
[44:58] came to you. Not because you are worthy.
[45:02] Your your righteousness is as rags. So
[45:06] therefore in that place if you are
[45:08] thinking or living like a servant purely
[45:11] on the basis of what you can do
[45:14] or what you haven't done and you're
[45:17] dwelling in that place or what you you
[45:19] should have done or what you shouldn't
[45:22] have done. Yeah. Then Satan is going to
[45:25] hop right there and say, "You are not
[45:28] worthy at all to be sitting in this room
[45:31] tonight. You're just a hypocrite. You're
[45:34] sitting here by um uh by I don't know.
[45:37] You're just playing the part of a
[45:38] hypocrite." And and Satan, anybody ever
[45:41] feel this? Am I just talking about
[45:45] it's exhausting
[45:47] to live in that place? So why live in
[45:50] that place? Yeah. Why? Why still think
[45:53] like a servant and act like a servant
[45:55] and and and even in in in that hidden
[45:58] place where you are, where nobody else
[46:01] is, where even your wife or your husband
[46:04] or your children, they don't see that
[46:06] place. It could be in your in in in the
[46:09] inner it's it's way down deep. Right.
[46:13] And you're you're living like a servant
[46:15] and thinking like a servant. Wow. It's a
[46:18] difficult place to be. It's exhausting.
[46:20] Amen.
[46:23] If that's even in part where you are
[46:25] this evening, you don't have to be
[46:28] there. Thank you, Lord.
[46:31] I I believe with all my
[46:34] heart that when you are in
[46:36] Christ, you are no more a servant.
[46:41] You are a son and daughter of the most
[46:44] high God. Amen. You don't have to live
[46:50] with the religious thinking of a servant
[46:54] anymore.
[46:55] You don't have to have a servant's
[46:58] religion. You can have a son and
[47:01] daughter's life.
[47:04] You can have the
[47:06] vitality of having a a a fellowship with
[47:09] the with the Holy Spirit. Wow. that is
[47:12] available to you by the mercy and the
[47:15] grace of almighty God. Amen. So if you
[47:19] are even in part deep down thinking like
[47:23] a servant with the pressure and the
[47:26] uneasiness and um it's on the basis of
[47:29] what I can do. Stop living like that.
[47:32] Amen.
[47:34] And step into being a son and daughter
[47:37] of God. Amen.
[47:40] Let's talk about that. Now, Jesus
[47:42] himself, if you don't believe Paul, you
[47:45] don't believe me. Jesus himself, he said
[47:47] in John chapter 15, henceforth, I call
[47:50] you no more servants.
[47:53] So Jesus himself is saying to you, I
[47:56] don't call you a servant. Now, there are
[48:00] elements of our Christian walk that we
[48:03] serve, right? Um, young men in
[48:06] fellowship halls, we pick up chairs and
[48:09] tables. That's what we do. Can I get an
[48:12] amen from all the young men? We just we
[48:15] move chairs and we pick up tables and we
[48:17] do it well. Uh, so that's an act of
[48:20] service, right? I am I am living in an
[48:22] act of service. So that's not
[48:24] necessarily what I'm saying because
[48:25] being in acting in service is a good
[48:29] thing, right? Getting your priorities
[48:31] right is very important. Ask Mary and
[48:34] Martha. Right? You've got to get your
[48:36] priorities in the right place. So being
[48:38] of service to one another and to the
[48:41] Lord is very very important. But Jesus
[48:44] says, "I don't call you. I don't look at
[48:47] you like a servant in my household." In
[48:50] other words, here uh my my my uh cup is
[48:53] empty. Go get me a drink and do it with
[48:55] a smile. Right? You don't find that. No.
[49:01] Right. In scripture. No. Now again, I I
[49:05] I want to just um repeat myself on
[49:08] purpose here. You I don't want you to
[49:11] think like a servant anymore and act
[49:13] like a servant and live like a servant.
[49:16] I want you to be a son and daughter of
[49:18] God.
[49:19] So Jesus, nowhere in scripture does he
[49:21] say, "Go get me a drink and and
[49:25] quick." He he doesn't look at you. He
[49:28] this is these are his words himself.
[49:30] Henceforth I call you not servants. For
[49:32] the servant knoweth not what his lord
[49:34] doeth. But I have called you friends.
[49:38] For all things that I have heard of my
[49:40] father I have made known unto you. Jesus
[49:45] himself doesn't look at you like you're
[49:47] a servant. Right? A hired help in the
[49:50] house. So you don't have to act like
[49:53] that. Well, I'm not worthy to be close
[49:55] to the Lord. So, I I'll just, you know,
[49:58] I'll do my part and I'll do my things
[50:00] and I'll do the things that I
[50:01] understand, but I I don't I don't know
[50:02] if I can really get close to him because
[50:04] I'm not worthy of it. You're still
[50:06] thinking like a servant.
[50:09] And Jesus doesn't look at you like that.
[50:11] So, why do you still live in that
[50:12] unhealthy place? Because scripturally g
[50:17] Paul is saying by the spirit of the
[50:19] Lord, you are no more a servant. You are
[50:23] a son and daughter of God. Praise the
[50:26] Lord. So we should live like it.
[50:31] Now I I um in just in in looking at this
[50:36] Paul is outlining I I think to me and
[50:39] just looking through this passage and I
[50:41] just I spent so much time reading these
[50:43] verses over and over and over.
[50:45] Naturally, this is very important as it
[50:47] relates to the topic of adoption uh and
[50:49] and and um that that concept. But I I
[50:53] begin to look and I I I realize Paul is
[50:56] outlining a very clear spiritual
[50:59] transition from bondage to inheritance.
[51:03] Yes. Right. The Holy Spirit is the token
[51:06] of our inheritance. It it is um it is a
[51:10] seal. It is a supernatural work that God
[51:13] does in you. It is it is something that
[51:15] is beyond your ability to grasp or to
[51:18] ascertain by human uh human ability. God
[51:21] did that work in you and seeing that you
[51:25] have that and if you don't you can have
[51:28] it. Amen. Even while I'm speaking to
[51:31] you. Amen.
[51:33] But if you have that, Paul is speaking
[51:36] about a transition from a mindset of
[51:39] bondage to inheritance
[51:42] of religion to relationship.
[51:46] The the bride of Jesus Christ should
[51:48] never struggle or should be striving to
[51:51] be accepted. She is already placed in
[51:56] the body of Christ.
[51:58] So living like a son which we'll go
[52:00] through here is is walking in a place of
[52:03] inheritance. Beautiful. It's walking
[52:06] with the mindset of every promise in the
[52:09] book is mine.
[52:11] not because of what I can do
[52:14] but because of what he has already done
[52:17] for me.
[52:19] So the transition from moving to bondage
[52:21] to inheritance from religion uh to
[52:25] relationship is one of being able to say
[52:28] it it isn't me who brought me to this
[52:31] place. It was the grace of almighty God
[52:34] and so I can walk in his power not my
[52:38] own. Amen.
[52:40] Now, to first understand this, and I I I
[52:43] just want to clarify this one thing. God
[52:44] is very interested in spiritual
[52:47] maturity. Um, we don't have time to get
[52:50] into all of it tonight, but brother
[52:51] Bham, he says in 1965, uh, you you're
[52:54] probably very familiar with this
[52:55] scripture, but he says or this this
[52:57] quote, but he says, "The only thing the
[52:59] church coming out has got to lay before
[53:02] the, uh, the presence of the sun, s o n
[53:06] to ripen." So, brother Bon would use
[53:09] that term many many different places.
[53:11] Now, scripturally um uh I I can't find
[53:14] the word ripen or ripened in scripture.
[53:18] You see the term uh harvest or maturity
[53:21] or terms being used like that in
[53:23] reference to planting. So, ripen wasn't
[53:25] a a thing that u the Hebrews weren't un
[53:29] were unfamiliar with. They planted.
[53:31] That's how they lived. Uh so, they
[53:33] understood planting and they understood
[53:34] the ripening process and they understood
[53:36] what that meant. But brother Brandham,
[53:38] he's saying and he's I I I think it's
[53:40] paramount that we all understand is that
[53:42] scripturally there is nothing left to
[53:45] happen except the change of our bodies.
[53:49] We are not waiting for an eighth
[53:50] messenger. We are not waiting for the
[53:52] return of brother Brandham.
[53:55] There is scripturally nothing left to
[53:57] happen majorly except the change of our
[54:01] bodies. Amen. So that being the case, we
[54:04] are in a place of spiritual ripening. We
[54:08] are in this ch this period of time where
[54:11] we await the change of our bodies.
[54:13] That's a wonderful place to be. But we
[54:16] have to understand then that in that
[54:19] place of spiritual ripening, we must as
[54:23] the bride of Jesus Christ awaiting that
[54:25] change, watch and be sober and be
[54:29] vigilant. So, in this period of time
[54:32] that we are in right now, May, I don't
[54:35] even know the date, but May, today 2025,
[54:39] we are in a uh a
[54:41] place we're we're ripening. Brother
[54:46] Brandham said, "That's the only thing
[54:47] that's got to happen. You as an
[54:49] individual have to lay in the presence
[54:51] of the sun to ripen." Amen. Now that
[54:55] term to ripen is very important to
[54:58] understand because there is a difference
[55:01] between growth and ripening.
[55:04] The fruit is the only thing that ripens.
[55:08] A stock doesn't ripen. Right. Now, I am
[55:11] not a farmer and you will quickly
[55:13] realize that. Uh I get corn and wheat
[55:16] and staff and stock and all these things
[55:18] mixed up because I I don't know anything
[55:19] I don't know anything about farming
[55:21] except what I read in the scripture. So
[55:23] enough I know enough to say that there
[55:25] is a difference between a plant that is
[55:28] growing and in a growth phase and then
[55:31] the fruit moves away and separates away
[55:34] from the shuck. The grain pulls away
[55:37] from the shuck and it is the grain
[55:40] itself that ripens. The stock begins to
[55:43] die. All of the life that was in that
[55:45] growth period now moves into the fruit.
[55:48] And when the fruit is on the vine, which
[55:50] we are believe, we believe we are in the
[55:53] manifesting time. The fruit is on the
[55:55] vine. We are in that period of time
[55:58] where the only thing left to happen is
[56:00] the change of our bodies. seeing how
[56:02] that hasn't happened yet and we are all
[56:04] here and we are in the period or the
[56:06] time of his coming right we must be in a
[56:10] period of ripening
[56:13] fruit ripens
[56:16] now maturity when you hear the term
[56:19] maturity or you see it in the scripture
[56:20] you have to understand that that is a
[56:22] state of being I am at
[56:26] maturity at maturity is the place when
[56:29] the harvest is done. So you would say
[56:32] that we are maturing or ripening until
[56:35] the harvest is taken because when the
[56:37] harvest is taken there now is is no more
[56:40] ripening to be done. The harvest he he
[56:42] takes the fruit and he uses it for the
[56:44] intended purpose. I pluck the apple off
[56:46] the tree and I eat it. It is being used
[56:48] for its intended purpose. So it the
[56:51] ripening phase would essentially be done
[56:53] when I pull it off of the off of the
[56:55] stock and it's there and it's being used
[56:58] for its intended purpose. So in the
[57:01] ripening phase now scripturally ripening
[57:04] is to when you have received now you got
[57:06] to take it back and then apply it here
[57:08] to Galatians chapter 4. If we are
[57:10] ripening then we have received the
[57:13] baptism of the Holy Spirit. We remain in
[57:15] the presence of the revealed word until
[57:18] the husbandman brings that life to his
[57:24] idea of maturity,
[57:26] not yours.
[57:29] In in and this is a very important
[57:31] passage now to understand in James
[57:33] chapter 5 verse 7 it says this be
[57:36] patient therefore brethren until the
[57:39] coming of the Lord. This is directly
[57:42] directly speaking to you about this
[57:44] topic. It's James is saying be patient
[57:47] therefore brethren unto the coming of
[57:49] the Lord. Behold the husbandman waiteth
[57:53] for the precious fruit of the earth and
[57:55] hath long patience for it until he
[57:58] received the early and the latter rain.
[58:01] Amen. So the rain falls and the um
[58:04] there's an early rain, there's a latter
[58:06] rain. And uh brother Benham was very uh
[58:10] clear when he said this is not a
[58:12] Pentecostal age. This is not a former
[58:15] age. We don't believe Moses message. We
[58:18] believe what God has revealed today,
[58:22] which is the mystery should be finished
[58:24] when the seventh angel shall begin to
[58:26] sound. Christ is the mystery of God
[58:29] revealed.
[58:31] Paul would summarize it so beautifully
[58:32] when he says this is the mystery unto
[58:34] the Gentiles. Christ in you, the hope of
[58:38] glory. And when you are in Christ, you
[58:42] are no longer a servant.
[58:45] You are a son and daughter of God. Amen.
[58:49] But we have patience and we wait for the
[58:52] husbandman waiteth for the precious
[58:54] fruit of the earth and hath long
[58:57] patience for it until he receive the
[59:01] early and the latter reign. In other
[59:04] words, I think so many times we have an
[59:07] idea of
[59:08] maturity, a state of being. If I could
[59:11] only be at that point, Brother Steve,
[59:14] that person that you're talking about
[59:16] way down, the person that I am, the
[59:18] person who's really maybe struggling,
[59:20] the person who is all, you know, filled
[59:23] with self-doubt, maybe the person who's
[59:24] doing just fine, but I I feel lost. That
[59:29] person, everybody with me? Yes,
[59:32] that
[59:33] person has to come to the husband's the
[59:37] husbandman's idea of maturity,
[59:40] not yours.
[59:42] Because you're thinking, "Oh, if I if I
[59:44] can do this and I can be this." You're
[59:47] thinking like a servant. You're
[59:49] thinking, "If I could only be this and
[59:50] do that, and if I could only, you know,
[59:52] get rid of this and get rid of that."
[59:54] Well, yeah, you might be better off if
[59:56] you could get rid of this and get rid of
[59:57] that. Sure. I'm sure you would be
[59:59] better. But the absence of those things
[1:00:01] won't bring you any more closer to God
[1:00:03] because he is the life, the truth, and
[1:00:06] the way. So when he comes, those things
[1:00:09] will begin to literally just fade away.
[1:00:12] The struggles and the the um the the the
[1:00:15] the person that you dislike so much on
[1:00:19] the inside, as you get closer to the
[1:00:21] Lord, that begins to change
[1:00:24] because you start to not think like a
[1:00:26] servant anymore. If I could just be that
[1:00:28] idea of maturity, then I'll be fine. If
[1:00:31] I could just get rid of this, I'm not I
[1:00:32] don't want to really surrender myself,
[1:00:34] but I I'll do it. I I'll get rid I'll
[1:00:36] get rid of this. I'll go fill the glass.
[1:00:38] Just give me the glass. I'll fill the
[1:00:39] glass and I'll go and do it. If you're
[1:00:41] thinking in that way and thinking like a
[1:00:44] a
[1:00:45] servant, then your fellowship with the
[1:00:47] Lord is going to really struggle. That's
[1:00:50] right. And in that deep down place, your
[1:00:53] narratives that you play out, every
[1:00:55] single one of us have a narrative,
[1:00:57] right? A a way of thinking or a way of
[1:01:00] talking. Peter references it, the hidden
[1:01:02] man of the heart. The Hebrews referred
[1:01:05] to thinking and will and all of all of
[1:01:07] those things as the heart. So Peter is
[1:01:09] saying as you think in your heart,
[1:01:12] right? That hidden person. That's right.
[1:01:15] That's what God wants. And he wants you
[1:01:18] to move from thinking like a servant to
[1:01:21] living like a son and daughter of God.
[1:01:24] So we come to the husbandman's idea of
[1:01:28] maturity, not our own. That's right.
[1:01:31] Because if we if we're thinking, "Oh,
[1:01:33] well, if I could just be that person or
[1:01:35] if I could just be that titan of a of a
[1:01:38] of a of a believer at some point, then
[1:01:41] I'll be fine. Everything will be fine. I
[1:01:43] won't have any struggles. You know, I
[1:01:44] I'll I'll have overcome all of these
[1:01:46] things." and I'll be just fine. When in
[1:01:49] actuality, it's the husbandman. It's the
[1:01:51] farmer. It's the one who takes the
[1:01:53] harvest. He is the one that says it's
[1:01:56] ready. Yeah. So, your idea or perception
[1:01:59] of what that looks like is is is totally
[1:02:02] different than what the husband may look
[1:02:04] like. Now, he gives us a lot of clarity
[1:02:06] as to how to live and to an idea of what
[1:02:09] that looks like. Right. Right. We have
[1:02:12] an idea of what that looks like. But if
[1:02:14] you're thinking in terms of, well, I
[1:02:15] just if I could just do these different
[1:02:17] things, then that will bring me closer
[1:02:20] to the Lord. When he is saying, I don't
[1:02:22] look at you like that. In other words, I
[1:02:25] don't this is not you're not going to
[1:02:27] come by and get your paycheck at the end
[1:02:29] of the day. Right? That's how you live
[1:02:30] your life. That's how you go to your
[1:02:32] work. That's how you go to your job.
[1:02:34] That should not be and that is not
[1:02:36] fellowship with the person of the Lord
[1:02:38] Jesus Christ. That is a servants's
[1:02:41] mindset. If I do these things and I I
[1:02:43] really push myself and I I really try to
[1:02:46] do good, then then the Lord will slip me
[1:02:48] a paycheck at the end of the day and
[1:02:50] then I'll be fine. Very good. And you
[1:02:53] can I am I am amazed at the amount of
[1:02:55] the older generation who live like that.
[1:02:58] Yeah, it's true. I counsel so many
[1:03:00] people who are who are very long long in
[1:03:03] their years, senior in their days, and
[1:03:07] they think like that. Yeah. Well, if I
[1:03:09] if I could only do that or if I could
[1:03:10] only be that person. I I don't even know
[1:03:12] how to uh uh totally describe it. I
[1:03:15] think you know what I'm saying. Yeah, I
[1:03:17] hope you do.
[1:03:20] And they live a servant's religion.
[1:03:23] Yeah. Instead of by faith as a son and
[1:03:26] daughter of God. Amen.
[1:03:28] Now, in that ripening phase, and that
[1:03:32] and and I believe that that's spiritual
[1:03:34] ripening is the Holy Spirit bringing
[1:03:36] into uh uh bringing you as an individual
[1:03:40] into a realization of your inheritance.
[1:03:43] Amen. That's what ripening is. Is
[1:03:45] bringing you into a realization into uh
[1:03:48] really identifying this is who I am in
[1:03:50] Christ. Remember brother Benam, he he
[1:03:53] made that phrase. He says when she knows
[1:03:55] who she is, she'll be taken. I believe
[1:03:58] that ripening phase is the Lord bringing
[1:04:01] you into the realization that you are
[1:04:03] not a servant. Amen. But you are a son
[1:04:06] and daughter of God. Hallelujah. You are
[1:04:08] not a hired help in in the house of
[1:04:11] almighty God. But you are an heir of
[1:04:14] Christ with all things. Every promise in
[1:04:18] the book really is yours. Amen. You are
[1:04:21] not a hired help in the in the house of
[1:04:23] God because you are not adequate enough
[1:04:25] to be a child. Maybe because of years
[1:04:28] and years of bad behavior or years and
[1:04:30] years of of of that condition thinking
[1:04:33] of well I'm not I'm not worthy because
[1:04:34] I've got this struggle and I've got that
[1:04:36] struggle struggle. You will never be
[1:04:38] worthy enough to be a son and daughter
[1:04:40] of God in your flesh. You never will be.
[1:04:45] You will never measure up to to your
[1:04:48] idea of what you should be. you will
[1:04:50] never do it. So stop struggling with
[1:04:53] that and wrestling with that. Instead,
[1:04:56] surrender to the person of the Lord
[1:04:58] Jesus Christ and start thinking and
[1:05:01] living like a son and daughter of God
[1:05:03] who is an heir to every promise in the
[1:05:05] book.
[1:05:07] A son and daughter of God who can lay
[1:05:09] claim with the with the authority that
[1:05:11] God has given you to a promise. Yes,
[1:05:14] sir. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord. to a
[1:05:18] place where you can really come into an
[1:05:20] identification of who you are in the
[1:05:23] person of the Lord Jesus Christ to say
[1:05:25] it is no longer I who live yet I live.
[1:05:28] It is Christ who lives through me. Satan
[1:05:31] get thee behind me. You shall not
[1:05:33] prevail.
[1:05:35] Instead of let letting him plague your
[1:05:37] mind in that hidden person. You look
[1:05:39] great here and we're worshiping the Lord
[1:05:41] here. I'm talking about who you really
[1:05:44] are and I don't want to play around
[1:05:46] anymore. This is too late an hour. I'm
[1:05:49] getting to an age uh where I'm I think
[1:05:51] I'm still pretty young, but I don't want
[1:05:53] to fool around. I want to really be uh
[1:05:57] uh uh where God wants me to be. I want
[1:06:00] to be able to live my privileges.
[1:06:04] I don't want to let the let Satan bring
[1:06:06] me uh down and and and twist my thinking
[1:06:09] and and wreak havoc on my on my mind. I
[1:06:12] want to bring those thoughts subject to
[1:06:15] the obedience of Christ. So that Satan
[1:06:18] does not have any foothold in my life.
[1:06:22] Beautiful. I can say with authority uh
[1:06:24] Satan, you you cannot uh trick me.
[1:06:29] Because I am not unaware of your
[1:06:30] devices. I know what you're up to. So
[1:06:33] get thee behind me. I am not going to
[1:06:36] allow that thought or that imagination
[1:06:39] or that conscience or that uh that
[1:06:41] reasoning to bring me to a place of
[1:06:44] anxiety to where it cripples me.
[1:06:48] Anxiety is is is is worrying about
[1:06:51] something that's in the future. It is it
[1:06:54] is an impending thing. You can have
[1:06:56] anxiety about your job. I'm going to be
[1:06:59] fired. I'm going to be fired. Well, if
[1:07:01] you haven't been fired yet, then that is
[1:07:04] that may or may not be true. It is not a
[1:07:07] reality. It is a fabrication, which is
[1:07:09] an imagination, which is Satan's avenue
[1:07:12] into your brain. Right? That's true. So,
[1:07:15] Satan will will really push you in that
[1:07:18] direction. And you can allow yourself to
[1:07:20] get caught up with that, allowing Satan
[1:07:22] a foothold in your mind. This is Bible
[1:07:25] 101, right? And you can allow Satan to
[1:07:28] get a foothold to the point where he he
[1:07:31] will say, "You're definitely going to be
[1:07:33] fired." And you know what? You don't
[1:07:34] deserve to have another job. And when
[1:07:36] your family won't be able to take care
[1:07:38] of themselves, you will be ashamed of
[1:07:41] yourself. And so you'll be anxious. Now,
[1:07:43] if you're really bad at work, you
[1:07:45] probably need to get better at work so
[1:07:47] you don't get fired. And if you are
[1:07:49] going to be if you are if you are about
[1:07:51] to get fired and you deserve to be
[1:07:53] fired, then I hope that your boss has a
[1:07:55] real honest talk with you and said,
[1:07:56] "Bro, you need to you need to shake up.
[1:07:58] You need to you need to get yourself
[1:07:59] together here because you were late uh
[1:08:02] for 3 months straight to work by 3
[1:08:04] hours." Well, then you probably need a
[1:08:07] little good talk there. Maybe it was the
[1:08:09] Lord that allowed that situation to come
[1:08:11] about. Amen. So if you if you need a
[1:08:14] talk from your boss, I pray that he
[1:08:16] gives it to you so you will shape up
[1:08:18] because if you do something, you should
[1:08:20] do it as unto the Lord. So if you're
[1:08:23] going to go live your life, live as a
[1:08:25] son and daughter of God, not like a
[1:08:27] half-hearted servant. Whatever your hand
[1:08:30] finds itself to do, do it as unto the
[1:08:34] Lord. Amen. So whatever you do for a
[1:08:36] living, do it well. Do it strong. do it
[1:08:40] uh intelligently. God gave you a brain.
[1:08:42] Use it.
[1:08:47] But don't let the devil bring you to a
[1:08:49] place of fabrication in your mind where
[1:08:53] you are imagining things that aren't
[1:08:55] there. I'll never get married. I'll
[1:08:57] never get married. I'll never get
[1:08:59] married. That hasn't happened
[1:09:01] yet. It's it may or may not happen. It's
[1:09:05] a fabrication. So, you can get to a
[1:09:07] point where I I'm not going to get
[1:09:08] married. I'm not going to get married.
[1:09:10] I'm I'm I'm too ugly. I'm too ugly. I'm
[1:09:11] not going to get
[1:09:13] married. And that's it's it's nonsense.
[1:09:19] But you can allow yourself to think that
[1:09:21] deep
[1:09:22] down. And outside you, you know, you're
[1:09:24] happy, you're nice, you're everything.
[1:09:26] But deep down, Satan can be totally
[1:09:30] messing with you. True. a Holy Ghost
[1:09:33] bornagain Christian,
[1:09:35] a Holy Ghost fil person, and Satan is
[1:09:38] wreaking havoc in your mind, in your
[1:09:40] thinking. You can allow Satan to get a
[1:09:42] foothold. I don't believe a a Holy Ghost
[1:09:44] fililled believer can be possessed of a
[1:09:46] demon, but you can absolutely be
[1:09:48] oppressed by the enemy. We face it all
[1:09:50] the time. So, we can absolutely be
[1:09:52] oppressed by the enemy. And the enemy
[1:09:54] can get strongholds in your thinking. He
[1:09:57] can take memories. He can take past
[1:09:59] actions. He can take all those things.
[1:10:00] And he can he can mess with you deep
[1:10:04] deep deep down.
[1:10:06] You don't have to live like that. Amen.
[1:10:08] You don't have to let Satan just do
[1:10:10] whatever he wants.
[1:10:13] He He has no power over you.
[1:10:18] But what you let him do. Exactly. He's
[1:10:20] really good at it. Now, Satan has
[1:10:21] nothing better to do than to mess with
[1:10:23] you. I mean, really, what else is he
[1:10:25] going to do, right? They have nothing.
[1:10:27] They have not the spirits and and Satan
[1:10:29] have nothing other to do. They really
[1:10:31] don't. So they're they're they're
[1:10:34] probably going to mess with you, right?
[1:10:37] Uh they don't, you know, they don't they
[1:10:39] don't go to the beach.
[1:10:42] So they are d they are uh Satan and his
[1:10:46] his army are very focused on you and
[1:10:51] naturally your thinking. That's why
[1:10:53] brother Brandon would preach the sermon,
[1:10:55] the greatest battle ever fought is in
[1:10:57] your mind.
[1:10:59] Holy Ghostfilled, bornagain Christian.
[1:11:02] And yet Satan can can can really mess
[1:11:04] with you. You and and you can literally
[1:11:08] be thinking like a servant. if I if I
[1:11:10] just if I didn't do that or if I you
[1:11:11] know and when you should be able to move
[1:11:14] into living
[1:11:17] like a son and daughter of God to say
[1:11:21] no Satan get thee behind me I'm
[1:11:24] repeating myself on purpose now this is
[1:11:25] a Wednesday night so that 30% of your
[1:11:28] brain capacity I hope that this
[1:11:29] resonates with you and you remember this
[1:11:31] after we're done
[1:11:33] you can genuinely and truly by the by
[1:11:36] the resurrected power of Almighty God
[1:11:39] say, "Satan, get thee behind me." Amen.
[1:11:42] I'll have no part in this and move
[1:11:45] forward. Yes. In strength, in a in a
[1:11:49] ripening stage because you won't get it
[1:11:52] right all the time, right? You're in the
[1:11:54] flesh. Paul would say it best. It's not
[1:11:56] that I have ascertained. It's not that I
[1:11:58] have attained. It's not that I am
[1:12:00] already perfect, but I press towards the
[1:12:03] mark of the high calling. I forget those
[1:12:04] things which are behind me. That means
[1:12:06] I'm not going to let the past dictate
[1:12:07] the future. I can't delete the memories,
[1:12:09] but I'm not going to let the past
[1:12:11] dictate how I am behaving right now in
[1:12:13] this moment. And in this moment,
[1:12:16] beautiful. As brother Brandham would
[1:12:17] say, down with Satan and his gloom and
[1:12:21] up with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:12:23] So in every moment that God hands crafts
[1:12:26] and gives to you, you can in that moment
[1:12:30] say, "Satan, get thee behind me."
[1:12:32] Exactly. And bring that thought subject
[1:12:34] to the obedience of Christ. You know
[1:12:36] what that looks like? Maturity. That is
[1:12:38] someone who is strong, who is settled,
[1:12:41] who is sure, who lives with assurance
[1:12:44] and not just lives a servant's religion
[1:12:46] of I'm going to I'm going to try my best
[1:12:48] on the outside and look apart, but I'm a
[1:12:50] wreck on the inside. I don't want to
[1:12:53] live like that. I don't want that. You
[1:12:55] don't have to have it either. That's
[1:12:57] right. You are a son and daughter of God
[1:12:59] purchased with a price. And the blood of
[1:13:02] Jesus Christ has made a way for you to
[1:13:04] sit in this room tonight as a son and
[1:13:07] daughter to be able to say, "Satan, get
[1:13:10] thee behind me. I will not let you wreak
[1:13:13] havoc in my thinking. I will not let you
[1:13:15] destroy my attitude, my mindset. I have
[1:13:19] taken on the mind of Christ. By the
[1:13:22] power of the Holy Spirit, I have the
[1:13:24] mind of Christ. So I am not unaware of
[1:13:27] your devices and I say get thee behind
[1:13:29] me. And then what you do is you turn
[1:13:32] around and you say Lord help me with my
[1:13:37] wife. Help me with my husband. Yeah.
[1:13:40] Help me to be the kind of a man that I
[1:13:42] need to be in my home
[1:13:45] because I don't know what that looks
[1:13:46] like. I need to I want to know. The
[1:13:48] scripture is very clear. Ask of God
[1:13:51] wisdom and he'll give it to you
[1:13:53] liberally. You've got to ask it. But you
[1:13:56] first have to say, "Satan, get thee
[1:13:57] behind me." And say, "Lord, I I I want
[1:14:00] to know what does it mean to be a godly,
[1:14:03] strong husband in my home? What does it
[1:14:06] mean to be a strong wife, a mother? What
[1:14:11] does it mean to really raise my children
[1:14:13] in the admonition of the Lord? What does
[1:14:16] it mean to be uh uh to live assured,
[1:14:19] strong, stable?"
[1:14:22] Very good. You know what it kind of
[1:14:23] looks like in uh I believe it was
[1:14:26] Galatians or no it was Joshua chapter um
[1:14:28] I believe it was Joshua chapter 10 if
[1:14:31] I'm not mistaken on my 30% of my brain
[1:14:34] power I believe it was Joshua chapter 10
[1:14:37] in Joshua they're fighting they're in
[1:14:38] the promised land Ephesians Joshua they
[1:14:42] are
[1:14:44] placed so they came out of Egypt and God
[1:14:48] really had to deal with them it's a very
[1:14:50] interesting concept in in Galatia Joshua
[1:14:52] chapter 5, they come out of Egypt and
[1:14:56] that whole generation had to die. Uh and
[1:14:59] so now they're in the promised land. And
[1:15:01] as soon as they go out of the pro, as
[1:15:03] soon as they go into the promised land,
[1:15:05] the scripture says that they eat of the
[1:15:06] fruit of their vineyards that same year.
[1:15:10] The mana stopped falling from the sky as
[1:15:14] soon as they went into the promised
[1:15:15] land. Amen. In other words, the
[1:15:18] scripture all throughout scripture,
[1:15:21] milk, meat, child, adult.
[1:15:26] When I became a man, I put away childish
[1:15:29] things. We should no longer be children
[1:15:32] being fed milk. We should be able to
[1:15:35] handle meat. In other words, we should
[1:15:37] no longer act like children. We need to
[1:15:39] grow up. We have the revealed word of
[1:15:42] the hour. Now, there's all all of us
[1:15:43] different stages in our lives here.
[1:15:45] There's some that are very young, just
[1:15:47] starting out in their journey. There's
[1:15:49] some of you who have been uh in the
[1:15:50] message of the hour longer than I have
[1:15:52] been alive. Proof God has a sense of
[1:15:55] humor because I'm standing here
[1:15:57] preaching that and you've been in the
[1:15:58] message longer than I've been alive.
[1:16:00] That's that's God. Yeah, sure. And yet
[1:16:04] you you have to come to a place wherever
[1:16:06] you are because I know a lot of old
[1:16:08] people that are that are way older than
[1:16:11] me who who are not mature at all. They
[1:16:16] think like children. They act like
[1:16:17] children. So this is not respective of
[1:16:20] age. I know a lot of young people that
[1:16:22] are strong.
[1:16:25] They think steady. They walk
[1:16:28] circumspectly as Paul would say. strong,
[1:16:31] sure, sober, vigilant, as a as a
[1:16:35] ripening believer in this last day as
[1:16:37] the fruit of almighty God. That's why
[1:16:40] brother Bannon would say a seed word
[1:16:42] bride is because the fruit produces.
[1:16:44] It's the same. It's the original seed.
[1:16:46] It's the fruit. So what went into the
[1:16:47] ground? It comes out as the fruit. It's
[1:16:50] seed again. So in that stage of of where
[1:16:54] you are as where we are as the bride of
[1:16:56] Jesus Christ, you are in a place of
[1:16:58] ripening, not growth, what what occurred
[1:17:01] through the other ages. You are in a
[1:17:03] place where God is just now ready to
[1:17:06] take us away.
[1:17:08] You are in a place where you need to
[1:17:11] grow up in your faith.
[1:17:13] This is no longer a time to be a child,
[1:17:17] to act like a child, to think like a
[1:17:20] child.
[1:17:21] milk, meat, child,
[1:17:24] adult. And when the Israelites come out
[1:17:28] of wandering in the wilderness and they
[1:17:31] come into their their possession into
[1:17:33] their land, the mana stopped and they
[1:17:37] went to till their own ground. It's an
[1:17:39] amazing thing. They ate the corn of the
[1:17:42] land, the old corn of the land. It says
[1:17:44] that in other words, they were planting.
[1:17:46] They were tending their fields. They
[1:17:48] knew what to do and they went to work.
[1:17:50] In other words, they were no longer
[1:17:52] saying, "Well, you know, I'm uh I'll
[1:17:54] I'll I'll do my work, but the Lord is
[1:17:56] gonna the Lord is going to, you know, uh
[1:17:57] send down mana from heaven. Where's the
[1:17:59] mana this morning? There's no mana this
[1:18:01] morning." They were they got up and they
[1:18:04] tilled the ground. In other words, they
[1:18:06] were acting as a placed son and daughter
[1:18:09] of God. Because Ephesians now parallels
[1:18:13] Joshua and Ephesians is placing the son
[1:18:16] and daughter of God. You are in Christ
[1:18:18] Jesus sitting in heavenly places right
[1:18:20] now. You are made the habitation of God
[1:18:23] through the spirit. So that spirit that
[1:18:26] is on the inside of you is life. Amen.
[1:18:29] Amen. So you don't have to live or think
[1:18:32] like a servant. You can act and speak as
[1:18:35] a son and daughter of God. Look at this
[1:18:38] passage here in Galatians chapter 4.
[1:18:40] Then I'll go back to Joshua. It says
[1:18:41] this. And because in verse 6 in
[1:18:44] Galatians 4, because ye are sons, God
[1:18:47] hath sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:18:50] into your hearts crying, "Aba, father."
[1:18:53] In other words, the spirit that is on
[1:18:55] the inside of you is crying out. That's
[1:18:59] why when Moses came to the rock and he
[1:19:01] he already had the word of God and he
[1:19:04] said, "Lord, what should I do?" And the
[1:19:06] Lord literally looks at him and says,
[1:19:08] "Why are you crying about this? Speak."
[1:19:11] Amen. Right. Right. Stop crying. Stop
[1:19:14] wondering. Speak. You have the word of
[1:19:17] God. You know what must be done. Speak
[1:19:20] to it then. And he's saying here that
[1:19:23] voice in you is the spirit of God. It's
[1:19:26] the spirit of God that's in you crying
[1:19:29] abba father. You know what that term
[1:19:31] abba father means? It's an intimate
[1:19:34] relationship. It's not a father. It's
[1:19:38] lord.
[1:19:40] I need you. Yeah, that spirit that is on
[1:19:43] in on the inside of you, the life of
[1:19:46] Christ knows precisely what to do.
[1:19:51] That's good. If you if you cover it over
[1:19:53] with a servant's
[1:19:55] mindset, then you will be spiritually
[1:19:58] stagnant. Yes, you will. And God is not
[1:20:01] in the business of keeping people
[1:20:02] stagnant. He wants them to move forward.
[1:20:05] one foot in front of the other, one step
[1:20:07] after the other, moving towards a
[1:20:10] destination. Amen. He wants you to think
[1:20:14] like a son and daughter of God in the
[1:20:16] land.
[1:20:18] You know, it's very interesting going
[1:20:20] back to Joshua chapter 10, Joshua is
[1:20:23] standing there and they're fighting and
[1:20:25] in that passage uh in in Galatians
[1:20:29] chapter 10 or uh Joshua chapter 10. He
[1:20:31] he's he he doesn't he doesn't say now uh
[1:20:35] you know what's the the battle is raging
[1:20:37] and we need more time. So I I uh let's
[1:20:40] let's pray. Lord uh we need more time
[1:20:43] and we need uh I need you to help me
[1:20:45] figure this out. I really need you to
[1:20:46] help me figure this out. And I think
[1:20:48] sometimes, and I I mentioned this just a
[1:20:50] couple days ago in in a service, I think
[1:20:52] sometimes we are in danger of
[1:20:54] overspiritualization sometimes.
[1:20:57] And I don't want to be a person who
[1:20:59] overspiritualizes. I don't want to be a
[1:21:01] person who spiritualizes.
[1:21:04] So I don't want the Lord to be trying to
[1:21:06] get a hold of me and I'm I'm saying,
[1:21:08] "Well, no, that's there's nothing to
[1:21:10] that. I don't know. I'm going to go this
[1:21:11] way." And I don't want to be that. I
[1:21:12] don't want to undersspiritualize if the
[1:21:14] Lord is trying to speak to you.
[1:21:16] Sometimes he'll use a person. Sometimes
[1:21:17] he'll use your pastor. Sometimes you use
[1:21:19] a song, whatever it was, he wants to
[1:21:21] speak to you. He wants to tell you
[1:21:23] things. You've got to listen. So, I
[1:21:25] don't want to undersspiritualize, but I
[1:21:26] certainly don't want to
[1:21:27] overspiritualize.
[1:21:30] To the point where and I this is what I
[1:21:31] mentioned the other day, but you know,
[1:21:32] you get a a chicken nugget in the shape
[1:21:34] of a cross and you're thinking, "Oh, the
[1:21:36] Lord has spoken to
[1:21:38] me. I should buy that boat that I've
[1:21:40] been wanting to buy.
[1:21:42] Thank you, Lord. I'll be $40,000 in
[1:21:45] debt. But this is from the Lord. This
[1:21:47] chicken nugget. And you can
[1:21:49] overspiritualize it. Amen. Right. When
[1:21:52] you know that you shouldn't go in debt
[1:21:55] for a $40,000
[1:21:56] boat. It's just not a good idea. There's
[1:22:00] all kinds of scriptural principles
[1:22:01] whereby we live, right? And one of them
[1:22:04] is a prudent man foresees the evil. And
[1:22:06] the evil is that that boat is going to
[1:22:08] break down. So don't go into debt for
[1:22:10] it. save, maybe work a little bit more,
[1:22:13] try to try to work a little bit more and
[1:22:15] then save up and buy the boat. But we
[1:22:17] can, you know, overspiritualize because
[1:22:19] we want to do the thing that we want to
[1:22:21] do, right? And we can be in danger of
[1:22:23] it. In Joshua chapter 10, Joshua spoke
[1:22:28] directly to the son.
[1:22:30] Come on. You know the story.
[1:22:34] He didn't he didn't need to to do
[1:22:36] anything else other than to say, "Son,
[1:22:38] stand still." because the Lord has
[1:22:41] already given us this victory. So, I
[1:22:44] don't need to wonder. I I I I I don't
[1:22:46] know exactly how it's going to happen,
[1:22:48] but I know we need more time. So, son,
[1:22:50] stand still. And we're going to go on
[1:22:52] with what the Lord has given us. Amen.
[1:22:56] And they won the battle.
[1:22:59] So many times, I wonder if the Lord has
[1:23:00] just put us in a place where we know
[1:23:01] what we need to do and we don't speak
[1:23:04] it. Yeah. when the very spirit of God is
[1:23:08] in your heart crying abba father
[1:23:14] I don't I don't want to be the kind of a
[1:23:17] person that lives like a servant
[1:23:21] that thinks like a
[1:23:24] servant I want to be a son and daughter
[1:23:26] of God beautiful I want to walk in a
[1:23:30] place of inheritance
[1:23:33] I wanna I want to
[1:23:35] live in a place where no matter what
[1:23:39] comes my way, I can be strong and
[1:23:44] sure and steady, not tossed to and fro
[1:23:48] by every wind. That's good, but able to
[1:23:51] discern, able to deal with what comes my
[1:23:53] way. Don't misunderstand me. I'm not
[1:23:56] advocating for an absence of
[1:23:58] difficulty because we will never be
[1:24:01] without difficulty. I am not saying that
[1:24:03] you will come to a place or you should
[1:24:05] come to a place or you should try to
[1:24:07] come to a place where your circumstances
[1:24:09] will be perfect because they will not.
[1:24:11] What I am saying is that deep down
[1:24:14] inside person
[1:24:17] there God wants to meet you. Amen. And
[1:24:22] in that place, you need to stop acting
[1:24:25] with the religious attitude of a of a
[1:24:27] servant. And you need to understand that
[1:24:30] you have been positionally placed in the
[1:24:32] person of the Lord Jesus Christ as the
[1:24:34] bride of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:37] You are a seedword bride. Amen. You are
[1:24:40] in a place where the Holy Spirit is in
[1:24:43] you. And Jesus himself says, "I don't
[1:24:48] think of you then like a servant. I call
[1:24:50] you a friend because the father is going
[1:24:53] to show you what you have need to do.
[1:24:55] The Lord will provide you an answer.
[1:24:57] Amen. Christ is the answer. He will give
[1:25:00] you a uh you know the direction. He'll
[1:25:02] give you the answer to your problem.
[1:25:04] Yes. He'll give you the solution. Yes.
[1:25:06] You've got to ask him and be willing to
[1:25:08] wait. Sometimes you have to wait for it.
[1:25:10] You have to wait for the the rustling in
[1:25:12] the malberry bushes. Yeah. But you've
[1:25:15] got to be able to be in a place where
[1:25:16] you say, "Lord, what comes my way? I
[1:25:19] want to be strong. I want to be sure.
[1:25:21] Regardless of what people are saying
[1:25:22] around me, what may what what what
[1:25:24] happens here, what's going on in this
[1:25:26] circumstance, you can truly be in a
[1:25:30] place where you don't have to waver.
[1:25:33] Brother Brandham said it was the hidden
[1:25:34] place, eating of the hidden mana. And
[1:25:36] he, brother Bham went to such extent to
[1:25:38] where he said in that place that person
[1:25:42] will never be overcome.
[1:25:45] Amen. He said that person will have the
[1:25:47] victory all the time if they are eating
[1:25:49] of the hidden mana in the holy of holies
[1:25:52] in the holiest place in where the ark is
[1:25:55] there is a a container of mana here I'm
[1:25:57] going back in in time there was a hidden
[1:25:59] mana and he said if if you eat of that
[1:26:01] mana that life will sustain you right
[1:26:06] yes sir
[1:26:08] I want to be the kind of a believer
[1:26:12] who doesn't just play
[1:26:14] act who doesn't just come to
[1:26:18] church and acts like a good Christian on
[1:26:20] the outside and goes home and can't
[1:26:24] can't deal with it with with the devil,
[1:26:27] can't deal with the enemy, right?
[1:26:30] What what why would you do that? Why
[1:26:33] would you want that kind of a life? Why
[1:26:35] would you want to be a person who feels
[1:26:37] like a hypocrite inside all the time?
[1:26:41] It's it's an exhaustive place to be.
[1:26:44] Yes. So don't be there, right?
[1:26:48] In in Ephesians, he says, "Wake up, thou
[1:26:51] that sleepest." Yes. Arise, thou that
[1:26:55] sleepest. Maybe you're in that place
[1:26:57] tonight. I don't know. I just I just
[1:26:59] felt I I was going in a different
[1:27:00] direction. I just felt to come back to
[1:27:02] that simple statement. That simple
[1:27:04] statement. And that's all I have for you
[1:27:06] tonight is that we should not be
[1:27:09] thinking and acting like servants. If
[1:27:12] God himself doesn't call you a servant,
[1:27:15] he doesn't look at you like a hired help
[1:27:17] in the kingdom of God. He looks at you
[1:27:20] as his friend. Amen. He looks at you as
[1:27:22] a son and daughter of God, heir of all
[1:27:25] things through Christ Jesus. Every
[1:27:28] promise in the book is yours. You don't
[1:27:31] have to waver. You don't have to wonder.
[1:27:33] You have the authority to speak to Satan
[1:27:36] and to say, "Get thee behind me. You
[1:27:38] don't have to struggle anymore. You're a
[1:27:41] son and daughter of God. You have the
[1:27:43] ability to overcome the voice that is on
[1:27:46] the inside of you crying aba father. Why
[1:27:49] cry? Speak.
[1:27:53] If we could all, brother, we say if we
[1:27:55] could all get in harmony under that
[1:27:57] revelation. That's right. The bride will
[1:28:00] go." Yeah. Do you realize who you are
[1:28:02] tonight? It's not on the basis of what
[1:28:05] you can do alone. Right? You're not
[1:28:08] saved by that. You're not made perfect
[1:28:10] by that. But if you can live like a son
[1:28:12] and daughter of God, he will he will
[1:28:15] expedite and and increase that ripening
[1:28:17] phase in you. And you'll be able to look
[1:28:20] back and say, "No, it's not on the basis
[1:28:22] of what I can do. But I I'll show you my
[1:28:25] faith by my works." He will begin to do
[1:28:27] the work in you. It'll no longer be you.
[1:28:29] It'll be Christ in you, the hope of
[1:28:32] glory. Amen. You'll be able to come to a
[1:28:35] place where you can be strong mentally
[1:28:37] strong of of uh and and be able to gird
[1:28:40] the loins of your mind to be able to
[1:28:43] say, "No, no, no, no, Satan. You're not
[1:28:45] going to get you're not going to uh uh
[1:28:47] uh wreak havoc in my thinking and I'm
[1:28:49] not going to live in this anxiety uh for
[1:28:51] however long. I'm done with it." Right?
[1:28:54] Amen. You can come to a place where you
[1:28:55] can say, "Satan, it is greater that is
[1:28:58] that is within me than he that is within
[1:29:00] the world." So I can walk strong and I
[1:29:03] can walk assuredly.
[1:29:05] You've got to intentionally do that.
[1:29:08] You've got to press into the Holy
[1:29:10] Spirit. Draw nigh unto him and he will
[1:29:14] in turn draw nigh unto you. It's a
[1:29:15] scriptural principle. You've got to
[1:29:17] press into him. Why are you crying?
[1:29:20] Speak. Yeah. Move forward in faith and
[1:29:23] in confidence. Stop wondering. Stop
[1:29:26] waiting.
[1:29:27] If God has given you that word, move
[1:29:30] forward. Do what he has said to do.
[1:29:33] Amen.
[1:29:37] I think if if if if we are the bride of
[1:29:40] Jesus Christ and the best that we can do
[1:29:42] as individuals, I'm talking on an
[1:29:44] individual level now. If the best that
[1:29:46] we can do is act like a Christian in
[1:29:48] church and then go home and be
[1:29:50] wondering, well, am I, you know, am I am
[1:29:52] I wearing, you know, should I I've got
[1:29:55] this struggle and I got that and dealing
[1:29:56] and letting Satan have have his way. Is
[1:29:59] that the best that we can do?
[1:30:02] As I'm talking in an individual level
[1:30:03] now, and it is not. I am here to tell
[1:30:07] you that the Lord can do mighty things
[1:30:10] through you.
[1:30:12] You are handcrafted by almighty God.
[1:30:14] Amen. Suicide should should not have
[1:30:18] should not have its way with you.
[1:30:21] You are bought with a price. You are
[1:30:23] God's. And a suicidal spirit will start
[1:30:26] coming around. You absolutely have the
[1:30:28] authority by almighty God to say, "No,
[1:30:31] get thee behind me. I am of value in the
[1:30:34] sight of God." To the point that he
[1:30:36] called me his friend. That's to you.
[1:30:40] That's not to some other group of
[1:30:42] believers out there. That is to you as
[1:30:45] an individual in this room tonight. He
[1:30:48] called you his friend. He doesn't look
[1:30:50] at you like a servant. As if, oh man, I
[1:30:53] spilled the glass and it broke on the
[1:30:55] floor and the master is going to be
[1:30:57] really mad at me. He doesn't look at you
[1:30:59] like that. He looks at you as a son and
[1:31:03] a daughter of God. Amen. All the glasses
[1:31:06] are yours. Amen. So you break one, I
[1:31:09] think it'll be fine. Right? We live
[1:31:13] holy. We live true. Are you with me? We
[1:31:17] don't compromise on standards of
[1:31:19] holiness and truth and goodness and
[1:31:21] righteous living. We live according to
[1:31:23] the word. Believers believe. So I'm not
[1:31:26] saying that you can do whatever you want
[1:31:27] to do. I am saying that when you do make
[1:31:29] a mistake, he is gracious.
[1:31:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:39] I want to be strong,
[1:31:42] steady, sure.
[1:31:45] I want to come to that place where God
[1:31:48] wants me to be, not my idea of it. And
[1:31:51] you know what that takes? Rest.
[1:31:54] Yes. So, if I could leave you with
[1:31:57] anything tonight, I want you I want to
[1:31:58] leave you with
[1:31:59] this. Don't live like a servant.
[1:32:03] Live like a son and daughter of God.
[1:32:05] Live in your position. Live where God
[1:32:08] has placed you by the by the by his shed
[1:32:11] blood. Be be in a place where he can
[1:32:15] move you. He can shape you and mold you.
[1:32:21] Don't Don't live in that deep down place
[1:32:25] unhealthily. Surrender to him. Amen.
[1:32:29] Go before the Lord boldly and say,
[1:32:32] "Lord, I don't want to live like that
[1:32:33] anymore."
[1:32:36] You know, when brother Bham said, "We
[1:32:37] should be the happiest people on earth."
[1:32:41] Doesn't that
[1:32:42] feel so out of
[1:32:45] reach most of the time? You're thinking,
[1:32:48] "Yeah, amen. I
[1:32:52] no." And and I I I genuinely believe
[1:32:56] that you can come to that place when you
[1:32:58] move away from a a religious servant's
[1:33:01] attitude to a son and daughter of God to
[1:33:03] the place where you can say,
[1:33:05] "I can be of good cheer. Because God has
[1:33:08] overcome the world." Amen.
[1:33:11] No matter what comes my way, I know that
[1:33:14] God will make a way. I am standing on
[1:33:18] the word. I'm standing on the promises
[1:33:20] of God. and I I will be of good cheer. I
[1:33:23] believe that you can come to that place,
[1:33:24] even if you've got marital trouble,
[1:33:26] family trouble, financial trouble, you
[1:33:29] fill in the blank, you can be at that
[1:33:30] place where you can genuinely be happy.
[1:33:35] We don't find happiness in our
[1:33:37] circumstances. We find happiness in the
[1:33:40] person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:33:45] And I want to be a person who can be
[1:33:48] happy at rest, strong,
[1:33:53] sure, steady.
[1:33:56] Do you want that?
[1:33:58] The ripening
[1:34:00] phase is a work of God, not a work of
[1:34:04] man.
[1:34:06] If I could ripen all of you right now to
[1:34:09] the state of maturity, I would. I'm sure
[1:34:11] if brother Rowan could have done that,
[1:34:13] he would have done it years ago. It is a
[1:34:15] work of the Holy Spirit in you.
[1:34:20] This is not some other group of
[1:34:22] believers that we're talking about. This
[1:34:23] is you. Every single person in this
[1:34:25] room, irrespective of age, God wants to
[1:34:29] deal and work with you. He does not look
[1:34:32] at you like a servant. He has called you
[1:34:34] to a higher place.
[1:34:37] the bride of the last age. He calls you
[1:34:40] son and daughter of God of great value.
[1:34:45] Yes.
[1:34:47] Would you bow your heads with me?
[1:34:56] I want to pray with you.
[1:35:00] And I just want to leave you with
[1:35:03] that. That
[1:35:05] thought, stop living like a
[1:35:10] servant. Live like a son and daughter of
[1:35:13] God.
[1:35:17] Use the authority that God gave you and
[1:35:21] speak to the enemy. Get thee behind
[1:35:25] me. Ask of God liberally and he will
[1:35:29] give you
[1:35:31] wisdom. Pursue the leading of the Holy
[1:35:34] Spirit in your
[1:35:35] life. Lord, what would you have me to
[1:35:39] do? Where would you have me to go?
[1:35:44] Maybe you're in a place where you are
[1:35:48] crying. God said to Moses when he had
[1:35:50] the word, every promise was his. He
[1:35:54] said, "Why are you crying?
[1:35:56] Speak." So I challenge you. I challenge
[1:36:00] that deep down person that nobody in
[1:36:03] this room
[1:36:04] sees. Why are you
[1:36:07] crying? Speak. It's the spirit of the
[1:36:10] Lord crying. Abba
[1:36:13] father God called you no more a servant.
[1:36:16] Yes, you are his son. Thank you Lord.
[1:36:20] You are his son.
[1:36:22] You are his daughter.
[1:36:25] That's the Lord speaking to you directly
[1:36:28] from his written word. That is not a
[1:36:30] hope so. That is not a maybe. That is
[1:36:33] the that is the word of almighty God.
[1:36:36] Yes.
[1:36:38] I call you son. I call you daughter.
[1:36:44] So live like it. Amen. Claim your place.
[1:36:50] [Music]
[1:36:51] Heavenly
[1:36:53] Father, Lord, there's no
[1:36:56] doubt so many individuals in this room,
[1:36:59] young, middle-aged,
[1:37:04] old, where deep
[1:37:07] down Lord, intellectually we know we are
[1:37:10] in a ripening phase, but deep
[1:37:13] down they might be hurting. They might
[1:37:16] be struggling.
[1:37:17] [Music]
[1:37:19] Lord, I just
[1:37:22] pray and you you alone can do
[1:37:26] this. I pray that you would just sweep
[1:37:29] over every heart and
[1:37:32] mind. I pray that you would have the
[1:37:34] preeminence this
[1:37:36] evening to work in our lives.
[1:37:39] May we open
[1:37:41] enough, Lord, that you would be able to
[1:37:43] deal with
[1:37:45] us, that you would be able to lift us up
[1:37:49] from servant to son, from servant to
[1:37:52] daughter. Hallelujah.
[1:37:56] Lord, I will never stop serving you. By
[1:37:59] your mercy and your grace, I don't want
[1:38:02] to ever stop serving you.
[1:38:05] But I don't want to think like a
[1:38:06] servant.
[1:38:08] I want to act like a son and daughter of
[1:38:10] God. Amen. I want to be the son you
[1:38:13] called me to be. And I don't even know
[1:38:16] completely what that looks like. You do.
[1:38:19] And that's good enough for me. So have
[1:38:21] your way in me. This moment have your
[1:38:24] way in me. I don't have tomorrow yet,
[1:38:28] but I have this moment. So have your way
[1:38:31] in me. Work in me. Yes, Jesus.
[1:38:35] Lord, I
[1:38:37] pray for in the individuals in this
[1:38:42] room that you would help
[1:38:45] them. Lord, I myself, I I I say we have
[1:38:48] hungry hearts. We need
[1:38:51] you. We feel like we can't even walk
[1:38:54] without you holding our hand.
[1:38:57] So, Lord, I pray for my brothers and
[1:38:59] sisters tonight.
[1:39:02] Would you lift us up, Lord? I pray.
[1:39:05] Would you allow us to sing the
[1:39:07] song, I'm no longer a slave to
[1:39:11] fear. I am a child of God.
[1:39:16] May you have your way this evening.
[1:39:18] We thank you for this
[1:39:21] moment, but Lord, I pray that it would
[1:39:23] not pass for that individual that deep
[1:39:26] down they are
[1:39:29] unhealthy. May you meet them there.
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:34] You have the power to lift us
[1:39:37] up. May we
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:42] surrender a slave to
[1:39:46] fear. Let's sing it
[1:39:48] now. I
[1:39:50] am
[1:39:52] child of
[1:39:56] God. I'm no
[1:39:58] longer a slave. Let's stand and sing it.

[1:40:39] feet have gone. Sing it now. Oh, I'm no
[1:40:45] longer

[1:42:17] child. I
[1:42:19] am

[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:33] I am
[1:42:40] surrounded
[1:42:42] by liberated.
[1:42:53] Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:00] From Yes.
[1:43:03] with sons and
[1:43:07] daughters. Let
[1:43:09] us let
[1:43:12] us
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:16] free. You split the sea so I could walk
[1:43:21] right through the wind. My fears are
[1:43:26] drowned in perfect love.
[1:43:31] Oh, you resueed me. Oh, I will stand and
[1:43:37] sing. I am a
[1:43:41] child of God. Oh, praise the Lord. Sing

[1:44:04] slave to
[1:44:08] fear. I am a child.
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:18] [Applause]
[1:44:23] Wonderful.
[1:44:30] living like his son.
[1:44:34] There were so many golden nuggets and I
[1:44:37] know there was somebody in here that
[1:44:39] needed it because it even spoke to my
[1:44:41] heart. Hey, it's not a worksoriented ba
[1:44:48] base that we have. It's faith-based
[1:44:51] revelation.
[1:44:52] I know who I am. I was birthed into
[1:44:56] this. I was predestinated, ordained. I
[1:44:59] want to take my position because I know
[1:45:02] who I am.
[1:45:04] Amen. Praise the Lord. That was
[1:45:06] wonderful, was it not? Praise the Lord.
[1:45:10] Spiritual ripening. Brother Brennham
[1:45:12] said, "Watch that final stage of
[1:45:15] maturity. There is no visible growth."
[1:45:20] In other words, the apple has finally
[1:45:22] just it's come to its fullness, but now
[1:45:25] it's got to ripen
[1:45:28] and it stays there and it just ripens on
[1:45:30] the inside. Hallelujah. And he said
[1:45:33] that's what's happening. We need to lay
[1:45:35] in the presence of the sen and let all
[1:45:40] the greenness, let all this worksbased
[1:45:44] stuff get burned right out of us and
[1:45:46] realize, huh? Amen. That we need to live
[1:45:50] like a son. Amen. What a wonderful word.
[1:45:56] Sister Maggie has got a a
[1:46:00] testimony. And I had told her and if you
[1:46:03] don't mind and if some of you have got
[1:46:05] to leave and some of you that's fine.
[1:46:08] Sister Maggie, would you come up here
[1:46:10] now? I don't know if you're going to
[1:46:12] need a translator. If you want to say it
[1:46:14] in English, you can all be seated for a
[1:46:16] moment. You can be
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:26] seated. Come up here, Sister
[1:46:28] Maggie. She had an
[1:46:31] incident the other day and she wants to
[1:46:34] share that with you and uh so we're
[1:46:37] going to take the time here uh right
[1:46:39] now. Sister Maggie, please. God bless
[1:46:41] you.
[1:46:43] Yes. I'd like to share my testimony with
[1:46:45] you and hopefully it's going to
[1:46:47] encourage one of you here. The Lord has
[1:46:51] been so good to me and I have no way to
[1:46:55] thank him for what he did to me. I'm a
[1:46:59] living testimony today standing in front
[1:47:02] of you. So I just want to thank God.
[1:47:05] Praise him.
[1:47:07] Words are not enough.
[1:47:10] Word are not enough. Two weeks ago, I
[1:47:13] fainted and collapsed uh outside the
[1:47:17] graduation
[1:47:19] ceremony. And uh when I collapsed, I
[1:47:22] didn't know what happened next. I was
[1:47:25] gone. My spirit was going. I felt like I
[1:47:29] was already gone. I didn't feel my body,
[1:47:32] but I just felt like my spirit was
[1:47:35] going. And the people that were around
[1:47:38] me started praying, started screaming,
[1:47:42] started
[1:47:44] uh all that they could. But when my
[1:47:48] spirit was leaving, I heard a voice
[1:47:53] calling my name from far because if your
[1:47:57] spirit is going and that's the only
[1:48:00] thing you can hear is the voice. So I
[1:48:04] responded to that voice when I heard
[1:48:06] that voice it was sister Ivon's mukbite
[1:48:09] voice. So I've been told like when I
[1:48:12] fainted she was the first one who came
[1:48:15] and started praying praying hard and
[1:48:18] that was a real strong prayer and that
[1:48:21] prayer for sure that the prayer that
[1:48:23] bring me back to life.
[1:48:26] So I just want to share this testimony
[1:48:28] to with you like the God that we serving
[1:48:33] is a miracle working God. Is a living
[1:48:36] God. So no matter what the devil can
[1:48:40] show you, don't accept it because the
[1:48:42] devil was trying to take my life away
[1:48:45] before and I refuse it. The devil God
[1:48:49] showed me several times in my dreams.
[1:48:52] There were two sisters that passed like
[1:48:55] they were trying to call me like come
[1:48:57] let's go home come let's go home they've
[1:49:00] been calling me several time and then I
[1:49:02] was refusing to go with them I say no
[1:49:05] I'm not going and they say why are you
[1:49:07] afraid I say I'm not afraid but I'm not
[1:49:10] coming with you and the other third
[1:49:12] dream I had that was my mom and then
[1:49:14] somebody told me somebody that I know
[1:49:18] asked me to like go your mom is calling
[1:49:21] you and And when I heard my mom was
[1:49:23] calling me at that time I had no fear. I
[1:49:27] was going to my mom in my dream and I
[1:49:30] was like okay this is my mom calling me
[1:49:32] I have to go now. So when I reach to my
[1:49:36] mom and then my mom said no I wasn't
[1:49:39] calling you go back this is not your
[1:49:42] time I didn't call you. I didn't call
[1:49:44] your name. So every time that I've seen
[1:49:46] my mom in my dream, she always like an
[1:49:48] angel to me like protecting me. Even
[1:49:52] though the devil was trying to use those
[1:49:54] other two sisters faces to call me to
[1:49:57] take my life before time, but God didn't
[1:50:00] finish with me. So I just want to thank
[1:50:02] God and praise him for what he did for
[1:50:06] the prayers that my brothers, sisters
[1:50:09] showed and prayed for me that I'm alive
[1:50:12] today because of his grace. and love. So
[1:50:16] never lose faith. Our God is still
[1:50:18] working. God bless you.
[1:50:30] Hallelujah. Let's all stand
[1:50:33] together. We'll sing a closing song.
[1:50:36] Create in me a clean heart. I enjoyed
[1:50:38] that analogy that they didn't have
[1:50:41] anything to to say the word for the
[1:50:44] brain. So, they talked about the heart.
[1:50:46] But the Bible says as a man thinks in
[1:50:48] his heart,
[1:50:50] so is he. Amen. Well, Lord, don't let me
[1:50:55] be so carnal anymore to live in that
[1:50:58] servant realm
[1:51:01] about the works and what I should and I
[1:51:05] I'm not good enough and I'll never be
[1:51:07] good enough. Servants never go to the
[1:51:10] master's refrigerator and get what they
[1:51:12] need to eat.
[1:51:15] Only sons and daughters.
[1:51:20] If you need something, it's your
[1:51:22] father's good pleasure to give you
[1:51:26] the kingdom.
[1:51:27] [Music]
[1:51:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:33] Create in me a
[1:51:37] clean
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:41] heart, oh
[1:51:46] God, and renew a right
[1:51:50] spirit within me.
[1:51:58] Create in me a
[1:52:02] clean
[1:52:05] heart. Oh
[1:52:11] God, and renew her right
[1:52:15] spirit within me.
[1:52:19] [Music]
[1:52:23] Cast me not
[1:52:27] away from my
[1:52:34] presence and take not thy holy spirit
[1:52:41] from
[1:52:46] me.
[1:52:48] Restore unto
[1:52:52] me the joy of my
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:59] salvation and renew the right
[1:53:03] spirit within me.
[1:53:09] Heavenly
[1:53:11] Father, certainly I believe everyone
[1:53:14] that was here this
[1:53:16] evening can say it was good to be in
[1:53:19] your
[1:53:20] [Music]
[1:53:27] house for us
[1:53:29] to
[1:53:31] understand about
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:36] maturity taking captive every
[1:53:40] thought, every imagination unto the
[1:53:43] obedience of
[1:53:45] Christ. Think it not robbery that this
[1:53:48] mind that was in him be in
[1:53:50] you. Father, I pray that you will allow
[1:53:55] each one
[1:53:56] that heard this sermon tonight, those at
[1:53:59] home, those that archive it,
[1:54:02] whatever. I pray heavenly father let
[1:54:05] them think and ponder and meditate upon
[1:54:08] this
[1:54:10] and may they have a change of heart
[1:54:13] which is actually a change of mind and
[1:54:15] how do they change their mind because
[1:54:19] revelation transforms us.
[1:54:23] Let us go beyond confirmation and
[1:54:27] conforming, but be ye transformed in the
[1:54:32] renewing or the maturing of your mind.
[1:54:36] that we may no longer little babes
[1:54:39] desiring the sincere milk of the word,
[1:54:42] but we are mature, strong believers,
[1:54:46] Father, able to take the strong meat of
[1:54:48] the
[1:54:49] word, spiritual food in due season, the
[1:54:53] revealed word for this
[1:54:55] hour. That we might eat. For where the
[1:54:59] carcass is, there shall the eagles be
[1:55:03] gathered together. Father, I thank you.
[1:55:05] I pray that you will bless each and
[1:55:07] everyone that's here tonight. Watch over
[1:55:11] us and keep us. Father, many are
[1:55:13] traveling.
[1:55:14] Many are going to our youth camp. I
[1:55:16] pray, oh God, watch over everyone.
[1:55:19] Angels of God, ride with those in cars,
[1:55:23] buses, trains, planes. It doesn't matter
[1:55:26] how they get there. And heavenly father,
[1:55:29] we'll be certain to give you the praise
[1:55:30] and the honor and glory. I thank you for
[1:55:34] the service tonight. Bless our brother
[1:55:36] Steve for his labor in Christ tonight.
[1:55:40] What a blessing I can say it was to be
[1:55:44] in your house tonight. I thank you. I
[1:55:47] praise you. I ask these things for your
[1:55:50] glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:55:53] Amen. Amen. Amen. Turn around. Shake
[1:55:56] somebody's hand. You are
[1:55:58] dismissed. God bless you. Go in peace.
[1:56:01] pray for the
[1:56:02] services at camp. We'll see you after
[1:56:05] camp. God bless
[1:56:16] [Music]
[1:56:20] you.
