[8:11] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we've come to hear from you.

[8:14] tonight in a very special way. And we
[8:16] commit this service into your hands now.

[8:22] said, "Amen." It's good to be in his
[8:24] house on this watch night service. A lot
[8:27] of places we could be, but no better
[8:29] place to be than in the house of the
[8:30] Lord. I just came to glorify. Glorify
[8:32] his name. And then we'll go to the Lord

[10:11] tonight. Amen. Brother Amos, would you
[10:13] come tonight and just take us to the
[10:15] Lord in prayer? We've got two prayer
[10:17] requests tonight. Please remember sister
[10:18] Debbie Asel. She was admitted to the
[10:21] hospital today with a severe infection
[10:23] in her foot. Please pray for God's
[10:25] healing touch. She asked for no visitors
[10:28] at this time. So let's remember sister
[10:30] Debbie Asel. Pray the Lord would come
[10:32] and be with her while she's there in the
[10:33] hospital. Brother Paul Maples got a
[10:35] request for a good friend of his has a
[10:38] brain tumor will have an operation on
[10:40] January the 2nd and has asked for
[10:42] prayer. So let's pray for this friend of
[10:44] brother Paul's. And if you have a need
[10:45] tonight, just want to lift that before
[10:46] the Lord. Brother Amos, if you would
[10:48] come.
[10:50] [snorts]
[10:56] &gt;&gt; He's able.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's just bow our heads.
[11:04] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we just
[11:08] come humbly before your throne, Father,
[11:10] tonight, realizing, Lord, that there's
[11:14] no good in us lest you put it there.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we can come humbly, but we
[11:22] were told to come boldly.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; So, it's more of a respect, a humility,
[11:30] respect. Father,
[11:33] But it's a boldness in knowing that you
[11:35] can do all things and you have already
[11:38] provided.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; And I pray that you would just visit us
[11:43] once again, Lord, like you've done many
[11:45] in times past.
[11:47] Just like you came down in the form of
[11:49] Melzdc and visited Abraham, you've once
[11:53] again come down in our day, Lord, and
[11:55] visited us.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[11:57] &gt;&gt; You've given us a message, Father.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; To the world. It's judgment.
[12:03] To us, it's freedom.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; Freedom from our own desires. Fremer
[12:08] from our own wants and needs. Lord,
[12:12] [snorts] Lord, you said if we would just
[12:14] believe
[12:15] &gt;&gt; that all things are possible
[12:17] &gt;&gt; and that Calvary was a finished work.
[12:20] And there was some needs that weren't
[12:22] even pinned down tonight. There were
[12:23] some needs that are here amongst us that
[12:26] we are unspoken, Father. But Lord, you
[12:29] know all things
[12:30] &gt;&gt; and you have already provided
[12:33] &gt;&gt; and we thank you for that. We pray that
[12:34] you'd be with us throughout this
[12:36] evening. We're here, Lord, to dedicate
[12:39] our lives one more time, Father, to
[12:41] stand here at attention saying, Lord,
[12:44] teach us. Show us thy ways. We [snorts]
[12:47] want to follow you just like the
[12:48] Israelites followed the cloud by night
[12:51] and the pillar of fire by day. We want
[12:53] to follow you now, Lord. We thank you,
[12:55] Lord, that you've given us a message,
[12:57] Father. And the message is that you are
[13:00] in us. And we thank you for that. Thank
[13:03] you for Calvary. Thank you for the
[13:05] finished work. We pray that you would be
[13:07] with these needs, Father. The the ones
[13:10] that were pinned down, Lord, friends,
[13:12] associates, Sister Debbie at home with
[13:14] her foot that's Lord, it's been her
[13:17] Goliath that's been bothering her whole
[13:19] life, Lord. But you are more than able
[13:22] and your grace is sufficient.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'd raise her faith.
[13:25] Father,
[13:27] &gt;&gt; lift her up, Father.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'd be with those who
[13:30] couldn't be here. Be with those who are
[13:32] streaming, friends, family that are
[13:35] away, Father. Protect them. Give us life
[13:38] with purpose. We love you. We ask you
[13:41] these things. We pray that you would be
[13:43] with us through the service tonight. Be
[13:46] with us in the song specials, the
[13:47] testimonies. receive our praise, Lord.
[13:50] We love you. We ask these things in your
[13:52] name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[13:55] Amen.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's may be seated. It's good to
[14:00] be in the house of the Lord tonight. We
[14:01] want to welcome each one here to our
[14:03] watch night service. And those that
[14:05] might be at home streaming, if you're
[14:07] here visiting, we have brother David
[14:08] Cornmasser from Germany, Brother Owen
[14:10] Jorgensson. It's good to have them here
[14:11] with us tonight. If you're here
[14:13] visiting, we welcome you as well. Amen.
[14:16] come to the close of another year and so
[14:18] looking back at a lot of things that
[14:20] have happened this year in my life and
[14:23] we can say that God's been good.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Want to take the time to count my
[14:27] blessings and be sure to give him all
[14:29] the praise and all the honor for
[14:30] everything that he's done. So thought we
[14:32] could sing the song tonight. Count your
[14:34] blessings. Name them one by one. Amen.
[14:36] How many can say that God's bestowed
[14:38] many blessings upon you? Amen. When upon
[14:42] life's billows you are tempest [music]
[14:45] tossed. When you are [singing]
[14:48] discouraged thinking all is lost.

[25:03] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[25:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. Um,
[25:06] so this song is in the key of D. Uh, I
[25:08] was hoping to get the help of the
[25:10] musicians, the other musicians. Um,
[25:14] um, I know in 2025, um, there's been a
[25:17] lot of hills and valleys that have gone
[25:19] through. Um,
[25:22] and in 2026, I'm sure there's going to
[25:24] be more um, hills and valleys, but we
[25:27] know that he's the God of the hills and
[25:29] valleys.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; I hope this song is a blessing, too.
[25:50] I've walked among the shadows. You wipe
[25:54] my tears away.
[25:56] I felt the pain of heartbreak. [music]
[25:59] I've seen the brighter days.
[26:03] I've prayed prayers to [singing] heaven.
[26:06] From my lowest place,
[26:09] I held [singing] your blessings.
[26:12] God, you give and take away. No matter
[26:16] what I have, your grace is [singing]
[26:19] enough.
[26:22] No matter where I am, I'm standing in
[26:25] [singing] your love. On the mountains, I
[26:29] will b my life to the one who set me
[26:32] [singing] there. In the valley, I will
[26:35] lift my [music] eyes to the one who sees
[26:38] me there. When I'm standing on the
[26:42] mountain, [singing] I didn't get there
[26:44] on my own. When I'm walking through the
[26:48] valley, I know I am not alone. You're
[26:51] the God of the [music and singing] hills
[26:54] and valleys.
[26:58] God of [singing] the hills and valleys
[27:01] and I am not alone.
[27:10] Father, give [singing] and [music] take
[27:12] away every joy and every pain. Through
[27:16] it all, you [singing] will remain
[27:18] [music]
[27:20] over it all.
[27:22] On the mountains, [singing] I will bow
[27:24] my life.
[27:28] In the valley, I will lift my eyes.
[27:34] On the mountains, [singing] I will bow
[27:37] my [music] life to the one who sent me
[27:39] there. In the valley, [singing] I will
[27:42] lift [music] my eyes to the one who sees
[27:45] me there. When I'm standing on the
[27:48] [singing] mountain, I didn't get there
[27:50] [music] on my own. But I'm standing
[27:54] through the valley. [singing] I know I
[27:57] am not [music] alone in the garden of
[27:59] hills [singing] and valleys. Hills and
[28:04] valleys [music] got his and [singing]
[28:07] valleys. And I am not [music] alone.

[29:02] So before we go to the
[29:15] Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. So we'll go
[29:17] to Psalms uh 77
[29:26] verse 11-12.
[29:34] Praise the Lord. In Psalm 77 verse 11-12
[29:39] I say I will remember the works of the
[29:41] Lord.
[29:43] Surely I will remember thy wonders of
[29:45] old and I will meditate also of all thy
[29:49] works and talk of thy doings and may the
[29:52] Lord of the blessings upon the reading
[29:54] of his word let us bow our head gracious
[29:56] heavenly father we just praise you Lord
[29:58] thank you Lord for your faithfulness
[30:00] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[30:02] and your love lord thank you for your
[30:05] sustaining power your strength Lord God
[30:07] that we gather together Lord at the end
[30:10] of this 2025 Lord
[30:13] Thank you once again. Be with us Lord as
[30:15] we remember your works and your word
[30:18] Lord in our midst tonight in Jesus
[30:20] Christ's name we pray. Amen. So you may
[30:23] be seated. So I will title this little
[30:25] thought remembering the the Lord.
[30:29] And
[30:30] he said that I will remember the works
[30:32] of the Lord and surely I will remember
[30:35] thy wonders.
[30:37] And as we close uh 2025 and step into
[30:41] 2026, we give all the glory of God for
[30:44] his goodness.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we remember his good works unto
[30:48] us. As the prophet said, what is the
[30:50] works of God? And the works of God is
[30:52] that you will receive the one whom he
[30:54] sent.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; And we believe these last days, we are
[30:57] so grateful that we recognize, praise
[30:59] God, the one who he sent in these last
[31:01] days. Amen. Although the prophet already
[31:05] gone on the scene but we know as the
[31:07] prophet said the prophet for today is
[31:09] the holy ghost.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are so thankful that uh the
[31:13] message came in our generations open to
[31:16] us the mystery of what was in the back
[31:18] part of his mind in this last days and
[31:20] we always remember how good God is in
[31:23] our lives. Amen.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; We don't really knows about our life.
[31:26] Praise God. When we are born we are born
[31:29] in sin come to the word speaking lies.
[31:31] We don't know about God. Maybe some of
[31:33] you knows we are born in maybe a message
[31:36] church or something. But for myself, I
[31:38] was born uh we don't know God. We don't
[31:41] we don't read the Bible. But praise God
[31:44] when the message came, praise God into
[31:47] my life, I recognize, praise God, who I
[31:49] am,
[31:51] &gt;&gt; what God done for me. And I'm so
[31:53] grateful and always keep on remembering
[31:55] the Lord Jesus Christ. And it is really
[31:58] so so so blessed to remember what he has
[32:01] done for us.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Not only what he has done but what he is
[32:05] doing right now. Amen. Continue to do.
[32:07] Amen. In the future. And we are so
[32:10] thankful. The more we remember what he
[32:12] has done in our lives, the more we have
[32:14] confidence in our life to continue to
[32:17] move on. Cuz he never fail us or never
[32:20] or never forsake us. But sometimes we
[32:23] are tempted to to think about our past
[32:26] failure.
[32:28] But remember as Paul said in Ephesians
[32:31] 3:13, he said, "Brethren, I count not
[32:35] myself
[32:36] to have apprehended but this one thing I
[32:39] do, forgetting those things, Amen. which
[32:42] are in the past, our hills and valleys,
[32:45] amen, which are behind, and reaching
[32:48] forth unto those things which are
[32:50] before." Hallelujah. So we have the
[32:52] message of the hour that we are looking
[32:54] forward to and that is the changing of
[32:57] our bodies. So this message the changing
[32:59] of our body is not just a meat or a
[33:02] thought. It is the message of the hour
[33:04] which God vindicated in these last days.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As Paul said I press toward
[33:09] the mark
[33:11] &gt;&gt; for the price of high calling
[33:15] &gt;&gt; of God in Christ Jesus. Remember that
[33:17] there is a power that is released upon
[33:19] us.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:21] When we are able to disregard our
[33:23] failure and sin of the past and embrace
[33:26] the grace of God
[33:28] &gt;&gt; in our lives,
[33:29] &gt;&gt; we must always remember the grace of God
[33:31] in our lives. We must we have failure
[33:34] with so many things but the grace of
[33:36] God. Hallelujah.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; We must remember the goodness of God in
[33:40] our lives.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Because it was his goodness that is
[33:43] running after us. Amen.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Wherever we go, his goodness is running
[33:47] after us. Amen. So we cannot really run
[33:50] away from his goodness and his grace and
[33:53] we need to remember everything. The more
[33:55] we remember the more praise God the uh
[33:58] the love of God is in our heart. Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; So it's not that we can just easily
[34:04] forget things but we must not allow our
[34:07] thought to retain those negative
[34:10] memories in the forefront of our mind.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because these are the things that
[34:15] are already
[34:18] in the sea of forgetfulness.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Once you say Lord I am sorry
[34:23] forgive me. It is already throw in the
[34:26] sea of forgetfulness and God don't
[34:28] remember it no more.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; So there is a power that will release us
[34:32] if we forget all those things which are
[34:34] in THE PAST AND LOOK FORWARD to the
[34:37] promises of God in these last days. So
[34:39] negative memories of the past failing
[34:41] can hold a person in a kind of mental
[34:45] prison house that will stunt their
[34:48] advancement of character of what God
[34:50] wants to advance them into. So there is
[34:53] an antidote of this problem of our of
[34:56] our remembrance of negative things of
[34:58] our past and that is to replace thought
[35:01] by purposely encouraging our mind to
[35:04] remember the things of the past of what
[35:07] the grace of God and the work that he
[35:09] has achieved in our lives.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us always remember not
[35:14] our past and failure but the grace of
[35:17] God that sustain our journey in this
[35:19] life.
[35:21] So remember in our opening scripture you
[35:23] said that I will remember the works of
[35:26] the Lord. Surely I will remember thy
[35:30] wonders. So it is our personal
[35:33] obligation to remember the works of God
[35:36] in our lives.
[35:38] not somebody's suggestions, not
[35:40] somebody's uh telling you to remember
[35:43] it, BUT IT MUST BE YOUR PERSONAL
[35:46] revelation of the grace of God in your
[35:49] life.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; And the s I will
[35:53] remember the works of God and meditate
[35:57] also of all thy works and talk of thy
[36:00] doings. So we need to focus on the
[36:02] thought of God's grace in our lives.
[36:04] Amen.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; So the psalmist here determined to
[36:08] meditate on the words and the works of
[36:12] God
[36:14] less he would forget. So we need to
[36:17] meditate upon the word of God.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; So we have tapes. So that's why we can
[36:21] press and play.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; As brother Brian Naidu said, press and
[36:25] play is not a doctrine.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; We can bless and play in our car, in our
[36:30] home or wherever we are. We can bless
[36:32] and play but not only in the church
[36:35] &gt;&gt; because we have pastor, we have
[36:37] ministers, we have live ministers, the
[36:39] five-fold ministry which can edify,
[36:42] praise God, the body OF JESUS CHRIST
[36:44] UNTIL WE come into the unity of the
[36:46] faith.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; But we need to meditate upon THE WORD OF
[36:50] GOD, PRESS and play.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; If you cannot press and play, read the
[36:54] word of God.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the theme of remembrance
[37:01] runs throughout the entire Bible.
[37:02] Remember God said that rainbow in Noah
[37:04] after the flood. And that rainbow always
[37:08] signify his covenant his everlasting
[37:11] covenant that he will not praise God
[37:14] destroy the earth with a flood no
[37:16] longer.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; So it's always a kind reminder of God.
[37:19] So when I was I I told you before before
[37:22] I start know I I have no any Bible
[37:25] background don't know nothing about but
[37:28] what amazed me after the flood or after
[37:30] the rain I saw rainbow and I always
[37:32] amazed about that
[37:36] &gt;&gt; and I and I tried to find out maybe some
[37:39] discover what is the meaning of this
[37:40] color seven colors I don't know anything
[37:43] about it until I come to the message of
[37:46] the hour hallelujah and it reveals that
[37:48] is The covenant of God to Noah, an
[37:51] everlasting covenant, a covenant of
[37:53] peace.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So it is there to put
[37:57] remembrance of the grace of God is
[37:58] continuing on.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; The Sabbath was a weekly reminder of how
[38:03] God rested on the seventh day. And the
[38:06] Passover was a yearly event to remember
[38:09] how God delivered the Israelite from
[38:13] Egypt. Yes.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; And also in Joshua chapter 4, they stuck
[38:18] 12 stone in remembrance of how God
[38:22] miraculously parted Jordan River so they
[38:26] could cross over on Ragdump.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; And throughout the psalm, David and the
[38:30] other writer wrote their psalms and
[38:33] meditate on the works and wonders of God
[38:35] in order to keep them in remembrance
[38:40] &gt;&gt; of the grace of God. Even the last
[38:43] supper
[38:44] we will which we will do maybe tonight
[38:48] at the last supper Jesus instructed his
[38:50] followers to take the bread and the cup
[38:52] in remembrance of him.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So remembering the Lord
[38:58] brings power into our lives.
[39:01] A keeping power and the supernatural
[39:04] power of deliverance and blessings. So
[39:07] remember we need to to remember the
[39:10] blessings of God. when we remember.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The word of God, it brings
[39:15] power.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT BRINGS POWER BECAUSE AS THE
[39:19] PROPHET SAID WHEN HE when he preached
[39:21] the message
[39:23] uh uh when he preached the message he
[39:25] said that the right mental attitude
[39:28] towards God's promise
[39:30] &gt;&gt; any divine promise
[39:32] &gt;&gt; when you believe it when you have the
[39:34] right mental attitude to remember the
[39:36] promise if you believe it
[39:39] &gt;&gt; then it will make
[39:41] &gt;&gt; or come into pass. Amen. Any divine
[39:44] promises put it in remembrance. Even the
[39:47] Psalms 103 said remember praise God the
[39:50] Lord and remember the benefits.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; What is your benefits? Your forgiveness
[39:56] of sin.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; It's already done deal. Hallelujah.
[40:00] Never forget your business. Always
[40:02] remember that God had already done it.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; It is already done. It is already
[40:07] finished in Calvary. Your sin was
[40:10] already finished. Praise God. Whatever
[40:12] trial you are in IS ALREADY DONE. GOD
[40:14] PROVIDED everything for whatever issues
[40:16] in our life.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; We just need to come before him by faith
[40:23] &gt;&gt; in the message in his presence.
[40:30] Brother Bernho quotes Psalm 16:18 and
[40:32] David said, "I have set the Lord before
[40:34] me." And that's a good thing to do.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Psalm 16:8, "I've set the Lord before
[40:41] me." So he could not be confused about
[40:44] it.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be conscious
[40:49] &gt;&gt; of his presence.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; So David said, "I have set the Lord
[40:54] always before my face." And now David
[40:57] have set the Lord before my face. Always
[40:59] to be conscious of God's presence.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; So the title of his sermon is in his
[41:06] presence.
[41:08] It is not just a title as the always
[41:10] brother Ron tell us every sermon's title
[41:13] is not just a title but it was a
[41:16] declaration.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; So in his presence as the prophet said
[41:19] we need to remember before our face so
[41:22] that we can be we can be conscious of
[41:25] his presence tonight
[41:27] &gt;&gt; and I believe his presence is here
[41:28] tonight. Amen.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; You don't need to see him. You don't
[41:32] need to feel him. that if you believe
[41:33] according to the word that wherever two
[41:35] or three are gathered IN THIS DAY, HE
[41:37] will be in our means.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; We need to be conscious of his presence.
[41:41] Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember Sadra, Mesa,
[41:44] Abednego, there was a trial. There was a
[41:46] persecution that king Abopar declared
[41:50] that they will need to bow down to that
[41:52] image.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; But Sadra and Messabedo, praise God,
[41:57] speak the word. Yes sir.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; My God is able
[42:02] &gt;&gt; to deliver us
[42:04] &gt;&gt; from this fiery furnace.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, if he will not still we
[42:11] will not bow down.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Remember he uttered the word.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; My God is able to deliver us. Yes.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Then when they were thrown into the fire
[42:21] furnace, praise God,
[42:26] there was no even a smell of a smoke in
[42:29] their hair, in their dress or something
[42:31] like
[42:32] &gt;&gt; they walk.
[42:34] They never been touched BY THE FIRE
[42:36] WHATSOEVER because praise GOD THEY ARE
[42:38] CONSCIOUS
[42:40] &gt;&gt; OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD. THEY ALREADY
[42:42] UTTER THE WORD. My God is able to
[42:45] deliver them. Amen. AMEN.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T SEE HIM, THEY
[42:49] DIDN'T FEEL HIM, BUT HE WAS THERE.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS NEBUCHADNEZZAR WHO SAW THE
[42:55] PORTMEN.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; But three of them didn't really
[43:04] saw the portman.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Do you
[43:09] are you conscious of his presence
[43:11] tonight?
[43:13] He don't need to show him physically. He
[43:16] don't need to let you feel
[43:19] &gt;&gt; sensations but he need to praise God to
[43:23] believe him according to his word. And
[43:25] we need to have the right mental
[43:27] attitudes toward his word. Be conscious
[43:29] OF HIS PRESENCE. WHATEVER YOUR PROBLEM
[43:31] TONIGHT, PRAISE be conscious of his
[43:33] promises.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; He will deliver you. Praise God. He will
[43:38] heal you. He will restore you. There is
[43:40] redemption in his presence. Amen.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; That's why in his presence there will be
[43:46] &gt;&gt; joy.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; I always say this when I was in in a
[43:53] mission field. Don't look at me blankly
[43:59] because we come here to worship God.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you are not satisfied with
[44:05] the preacher, ask God to touch the
[44:07] preacher. He become a mouthpiece so that
[44:09] he can speak unto you. Because we need
[44:11] to BE CONSCIOUS OF HIS PRESENCE because
[44:13] whenever two or three are gathering he
[44:14] said he will be in our midst.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; So we need to be conscious
[44:19] &gt;&gt; just like El Gi when they were
[44:23] surrounded by by the Syrian army he
[44:26] thought that they were only the people.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So Elijah said, "Lord, open the
[44:36] eyes of
[44:38] &gt;&gt; we are just in another dimension."
[44:41] &gt;&gt; And when God opened his eye, he saw,
[44:43] praise God,
[44:44] &gt;&gt; thousands of angels surrounded it.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Remember in Exodus 23:20,
[44:54] he said that I will send angel before
[44:57] you
[44:59] &gt;&gt; to protect you.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. to guide you.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the angel is here
[45:05] tonight?
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Because his word never fail. He is the
[45:09] same. Praise God. Yesterday, today and
[45:11] forever. And we just need to be
[45:12] conscious of his presence. So that's why
[45:14] when you see and SAY IT'S THE ANGEL OVER
[45:17] HERE,
[45:18] &gt;&gt; you need to rejoice with it with us.
[45:21] So that's why when angel saw that you
[45:24] have no reactions to the word of God,
[45:27] the angel would thought maybe this is
[45:28] one of us
[45:31] because the angel don't know how to
[45:34] appreciate redemption.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't react to to they don't
[45:40] experience being saved. They don't
[45:41] experience to be redeemed.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; They just sit there because they were
[45:45] worshippers. Amen. That was the only
[45:47] thing that they know.
[45:50] They don't know how to appreciate the
[45:51] word of God. BUT IF YOU ARE IN THE
[45:53] PRESENCE OF GOD, maybe hallelujah, you
[45:55] need to be you need to be alive
[45:58] &gt;&gt; because the joy of the Lord is in you.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; That's why we said I'm SO GLAD WHEN THEY
[46:02] SAID UNTO ME, let us go into the house
[46:04] of the Lord. LET US GO INTO THE HOUSE
[46:06] NOT JUST A TRADITIONS TO GO every 30th,
[46:10] &gt;&gt; but we need to come to worship God in
[46:12] spirit and in truth. Amen. Amen.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Because when God SENT A PROPHET IN THIS
[46:16] LIFETIME and he revealed God unto each
[46:18] and every one of us, we become the true
[46:20] worshipper of God.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Because God is not be called God unless
[46:24] there's somebody to worship him. And
[46:26] only the real believer which receive the
[46:29] message OF THE HOUR KNOW EXACTLY who God
[46:32] was
[46:34] &gt;&gt; and he could not be God unless there's a
[46:36] worshipper. Are you a worshipper
[46:38] tonight?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we need to be thankful
[46:42] and be conscious of his presence
[46:44] &gt;&gt; every not only on the 31st of December
[46:49] &gt;&gt; but every day in our life we need to be
[46:51] conscious of that
[46:53] &gt;&gt; as the prophet said here
[47:01] as the prophet said
[47:05] he wanted to be conscious of his
[47:07] presence. So David said, "I have set the
[47:09] Lord always before my praise." Now I,
[47:12] David, have set the Lord before my face
[47:14] always to be conscious of God's
[47:16] presence. Wouldn't it be a good lesson
[47:19] for all of us tonight?
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Set the Lord before my face so we'll be
[47:25] conscious of his presence. Put him
[47:27] first. And why?
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Put him first before you. Why? Then you
[47:33] won't sin. When you are realizing that
[47:36] constantly you're in the presence of God
[47:39] when you realize God's around you watch
[47:42] and what you say.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD NEVER LEAVE US nor
[47:46] forsake us.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe sometime oh I am I I am in
[47:50] trouble. I am in prayer as if I I if I
[47:54] cannot feel the presence of God.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; We need to be conscious he's always here
[47:58] &gt;&gt; because he promised I will be with you
[48:00] even in you and two. That is not just a
[48:02] good quote. You need to experience him
[48:05] personally.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 73. A man when he thinks God's
[48:11] gone, he'll cuss. He'll lust after
[48:15] women. He steal, he cheat, he lie.
[48:19] Speaking about maybe this is unbeliever.
[48:21] But for believers, I don't think you can
[48:23] do that.
[48:26] He'll do anything when he think that God
[48:28] don't see him.
[48:30] but bring him into the presence of God.
[48:33] He'll stop it right now.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; And David said, "I have put the Lord
[48:41] always before me." That's a good thing.
[48:43] No wonder God said he was a man after
[48:45] his own heart.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Man will do everything when he think
[48:50] that God isn't near.
[48:56] This is a wakeup call to those who feel
[48:58] that God is not here. I can do anything
[49:00] I want.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; But God is speaking to us tonight
[49:05] &gt;&gt; because this quotation didn't come for
[49:07] myself. It just by inspiration of God
[49:09] that I open it and God put it here
[49:11] tonight.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Maybe he sent it to somebody else.
[49:16] Not outside but inside the church.
[49:18] Because remember there are three kinds
[49:20] of believer in the church.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; There are make believer there are
[49:23] believers and non-believers.
[49:27] But when he realized that God's near,
[49:30] did you ever notice a sinner,
[49:33] let a godly person walk up, he'll quit
[49:36] his cushioning.
[49:38] If he's got any respect at all, see, he
[49:41] won't tell the dirty jokes that he would
[49:44] told. He live off that because he knows
[49:47] that he's in the presence of God cuz God
[49:50] dwells in the tabernacle of his people.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think each one of us maybe
[49:57] have experienced that when sometimes we
[49:58] we pass by unbelievers and they know
[50:00] they they they saw us and they just stop
[50:03] cussing.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; In my place there are so-called uh
[50:10] even so-called message believers.
[50:13] So when I enter their house immediately
[50:17] they they they panic.
[50:20] They put off the television or what show
[50:23] ever that they're doing and say, "Oh,
[50:25] brother, God bless you,
[50:28] brother. It's okay. I didn't come here
[50:30] to inspect about what you're doing."
[50:31] Just continue what you're doing. I just
[50:34] come here to say hello. Hi. But I am not
[50:37] here to judge you what you're doing. It
[50:39] is by the grace of God that you need to
[50:41] have your own personal revelation,
[50:43] personal conviction. Amen. You need to
[50:46] have your personal remembering the works
[50:48] of God in your life. What did you do in
[50:50] your life?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; So we need to remember the Lord this
[50:56] 2026.
[50:58] Hallelujah. God in his grace places
[51:00] experience in our life
[51:03] so that we can remember the things of
[51:06] what he did for you.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that happens in our
[51:10] life it needs we need to experience it.
[51:14] The fact that God has allowed us to
[51:15] receive the message that he has sent in
[51:17] this day is such a great glorious thing
[51:20] that he has bestowed upon us and we must
[51:22] never let ourselves forget it.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Let us always embrace it.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; We need to be grateful for the things
[51:31] that we have done. Remember not
[51:33] everybody can receive what you were
[51:34] saying.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; We know that. Amen. Because if you share
[51:38] this this message to to somebody that
[51:41] your friend or family or something, they
[51:43] will reject what you believe.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; But for each and every one of us, we
[51:47] cannot deny it. We cannot reject it. We
[51:49] just believe it. If we don't REALLY
[51:51] UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES, BUT WE JUST
[51:53] BELIEVE it
[51:55] &gt;&gt; because God don't require us to explain
[51:57] what we believe. We just God look at
[52:00] faith
[52:02] &gt;&gt; in our lives.
[52:04] Amen.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; So the fulfillment of his great promises
[52:09] in his word and his faithfulness in
[52:12] sending the minister of Malachi 4 in our
[52:14] day. We know that we are actually a part
[52:16] of this great fulfillment. We are part
[52:19] of this prophecy being fulfilled.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 is not only for brother Brham.
[52:25] Malachi 4 is also for us
[52:27] &gt;&gt; because he said Elijah to you.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; So you find your scripture. Praise God.
[52:33] and anoint the scripture so that you can
[52:35] manifest the scripture in your day.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the Deuteronomy
[52:43] chapter 6, this is the prophet reminding
[52:46] the people. He said, "And this word
[52:49] which I command thee this day shall be
[52:52] in thine heart." Remember the message
[52:55] that we receive is not to be
[52:57] intellectual knowledge of the word. It
[52:59] must be in our heart.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; It must be a part of our life. Yes.
[53:02] Amen.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Because he said, "I am the way." There's
[53:04] no other way that you can have
[53:06] salvation. There's no other way that you
[53:07] can know the truth. There's the only way
[53:09] is Jesus Christ.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; He is the only way that you can know the
[53:16] &gt;&gt; And when the truth comes, he will set
[53:18] you free. Set you free from unbelief.
[53:20] Set you free from s uh
[53:23] uh
[53:25] set you free from your unbeliefs and
[53:29] traditions.
[53:30] And thou shalt teach them diligently
[53:33] unto thy children. This is the command
[53:35] of Moses.
[53:38] And shall talk to them when thou sitest
[53:41] in thine house.
[53:43] And when thou walkest by thy way, and
[53:45] when thou liest down, and when thou
[53:48] risest up, you need to talk about the
[53:52] promises of God.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; When you walk, when you lie down, when
[53:55] you eat, in your dinner. Amen. Let us
[53:58] knock about basketball stars or
[54:00] superstar, whoever. Let us be reminded
[54:03] of the word of God.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt bind them for a sign unto
[54:07] thine hand, and thy shall be a frontlet
[54:09] between thy eyes, and thou shalt write
[54:12] them upon the post of thy house, and on
[54:15] the gates.
[54:17] You need to put some scripture in your
[54:20] dining room, in your hallelujah, in your
[54:23] kitchen, in your door, whatever part of
[54:26] your word, you need to have the word of
[54:28] God ATTACHED TO IT SO THAT YOU cannot
[54:30] forget the promises of God when we enter
[54:33] your your your your door. God bless you.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; We need to put that in remembrance.
[54:43] Don't put any movie stars in that
[54:45] display or basketball star
[54:48] &gt;&gt; cuz Moses said, "And thou shalt write
[54:50] them upon the post of thy house
[54:53] &gt;&gt; and on thy gates and it shall be when
[54:56] God shall have brought thee into the
[54:58] land which he and thy father to Abraham
[55:01] to Isaac to Jacob to be to to give thee
[55:05] great and godly cities that thou
[55:08] buildest not." So every promises praise
[55:12] God that we received it was already
[55:15] given to Abraham
[55:18] and we were in Abraham in seed form. So
[55:22] whatever God promised to Abraham we are
[55:25] included in that promises.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why he said that
[55:31] the houses full of good things which
[55:33] thou feelest not.
[55:36] houses full of good things which thou
[55:38] feelest not
[55:42] and wells dig which thou dst not. So
[55:45] when God Abraham or Moses give them the
[55:47] promised land
[55:49] what they need when they go to the
[55:51] promised land was already provided all
[55:54] the waters the fruit and everything.
[55:56] Even Moses told a land
[55:59] &gt;&gt; filled with milk and honey. They don't
[56:02] need to work it out to plant it and to
[56:05] eat it. No, they just go there and claim
[56:09] the promises.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. BECAUSE GOD ALREADY PROVIDED
[56:13] IT. AND GOD IS and Moses is reminding
[56:15] them of the grace of God in their life.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; And house is full of good things which
[56:21] thou feelest not, and well dig with thou
[56:23] dkest not. Vineyards and olive tree
[56:26] which thou plantest not, when thou shalt
[56:28] have eaten and be full. What a great
[56:31] blessing.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; We need to recognize what with whatever
[56:34] we have in our journey, God already
[56:37] provided.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Our works, our wealth, whatever it is,
[56:40] good health. Praise God. Everything is
[56:42] already provided by God.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; But here is something that God wants to
[56:49] remind you in verse 12. Then beware lest
[56:53] thou forget the Lord
[56:57] which brought thee forth out of the land
[56:59] of Egypt from the house of bondage. So
[57:02] continue on Deuteronomy 8 10-20. This
[57:06] chapter is to remind them not to forget
[57:09] the blessings of God.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; When thou hast eaten and are full, then
[57:15] thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for
[57:17] the good land which he hath given thee.
[57:21] In other words, everything that we do,
[57:22] we need to give thanks unto the Lord.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Here again, verse 11, beware that thou
[57:30] forget not the Lord thy God. Remember in
[57:33] the book of Joshua, they serve God. Then
[57:37] after 40 or when the deliver was died,
[57:42] they go back to another gods. Then God
[57:45] send another deliverer. After 40 years,
[57:47] there's another 40 years they go back.
[57:50] They forgot about it.
[57:53] So God is faithful always reminding them
[57:57] of the goodness
[58:00] of his love. Beware that thou forget not
[58:02] the Lord thy God in in not keeping his
[58:05] commandment and his judgment and his
[58:07] statutes which I command thee this day,
[58:09] lest thou hast eaten and are full and
[58:11] has built goodly houses and dwelt
[58:13] therein. And when thy herd and thy flock
[58:16] multiply, and thy silver and thy gold
[58:19] multiplied, and all that thou and all
[58:22] that thou hast is multiplied, thine
[58:26] heart be lifted up, and thou forget the
[58:28] Lord thy God, which brought thee outpour
[58:30] of the land of Egypt from the house of
[58:32] bondage. So be very careful,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; prosperity doesn't really bear the
[58:36] goodness of God.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he allow it. Remember I I I
[58:41] have so many friends during the time and
[58:45] they said, "Oh brother, thank you that
[58:46] you are blessed by your business. I wish
[58:49] if God bless me, I will serve him more
[58:51] and more
[58:52] &gt;&gt; and God grant their wishes, bless their
[58:55] ministry or bless their businesses."
[58:58] Praise God. But the more blessings that
[59:01] they got, the more they got got away
[59:04] from the Lord
[59:05] &gt;&gt; and they don't go to church anymore,
[59:07] then backslide. Praise God. They enjoy
[59:09] seeing movies, basketball, everything.
[59:11] They forgot that it what they prayed
[59:15] for.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So when they were multiplied
[59:19] and God bless them materially, they
[59:20] forgot the Lord.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; I'm trusting that we are not that one.
[59:24] That's why remembering the Lord,
[59:26] &gt;&gt; what the blessings we have is come from
[59:28] the Lord.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God bless you materially so
[59:31] that you can support in the mission
[59:32] field.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; What will you do with your money? You
[59:38] cannot save it in THE BANK BUY AND BUY.
[59:41] Everything will be closed
[59:43] &gt;&gt; and you cannot bring anything.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD USED PRAISE GOD ALL THIS
[59:49] BUSINESSMAN to support a missionary
[59:52] &gt;&gt; because one soul is equivalent to 10,000
[59:55] words.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Grandad soul when you support a
[59:58] missionary one soul receive the Lord
[1:00:01] Jesus Christ. Someday
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; you will stand with us all because you
[1:00:06] support the missionary. Yeah,
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; remember the blessings did is not by
[1:00:10] your by your Yeah, sometimes it's part
[1:00:14] your struggle you can achieve but don't
[1:00:16] forget it was the blessings of the Lord.
[1:00:21] Verse 15,
[1:00:25] who led thee through the great and
[1:00:26] terrible wilderness wherein were fiery
[1:00:29] serpent and scorpions and dro where
[1:00:32] there was no water who brought thee
[1:00:33] forth out of the rock of the flimp.
[1:00:36] Remember, amen. God provided everything.
[1:00:42] When they rebel against God,
[1:00:45] God allowed them to be beaten by the by
[1:00:48] the the fiery serpent. But God always
[1:00:51] provide a provision for them. A serpent,
[1:00:55] a brush serpent. And Moses said you if
[1:00:59] you are beaten by the by the serpent,
[1:01:01] look at the bracing serpent in the pool.
[1:01:04] As the prophet said, there is there was
[1:01:06] no virtue in that pool. Just a brass
[1:01:08] pool. But you need to have the
[1:01:10] revelations of the word of God. A brush
[1:01:12] means it is already judged. Sin is
[1:01:15] already judged in your life. Amen.
[1:01:16] Everything that go is already judged.
[1:01:19] God provided. Praise God.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; provisions for us.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Who fed thee in the wilderness with
[1:01:30] mana. as they travel in their
[1:01:33] wilderness, God's so faithful every day.
[1:01:36] God providing a mana in them.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that mana when Jesus Christ I
[1:01:41] am that mana in the wilderness.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is the one who sustain
[1:01:45] us.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Who fed thee in the wilderness with mana
[1:01:50] which thy father knew not that he might
[1:01:52] humble thee that he might prove thee to
[1:01:55] thee good thy the latter end. And thou
[1:01:57] say in thine heart, my power and my mind
[1:02:00] hath gotten me this will. But thou shalt
[1:02:03] remember the Lord thy God, for it is he
[1:02:05] that giveth thee power to get wealth.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Remember that
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; if God blessed you materially, it was
[1:02:11] God.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; That he may establish his covenant which
[1:02:19] he swear unto thy father, as it is this
[1:02:21] day. And it shall be, if thou do all,
[1:02:25] forget the Lord thy God, and walk after
[1:02:27] other gods, and serve them, and worship
[1:02:30] them, I testify against you this day,
[1:02:34] that ye shall surely perish.
[1:02:38] When God bless you materially, sh it
[1:02:40] shall be, if thou do all, forget the
[1:02:42] Lord thy God and walk other gods. And
[1:02:45] remember, as the prophet said, God is a
[1:02:47] object of worship. other guys. It may be
[1:02:50] your car, new brand new car.
[1:02:53] It may be your sports car. It may be
[1:02:55] your sports idol or whatever god that
[1:02:57] you're spend your time with.
[1:03:02] Some spend their time playing computer
[1:03:05] games.
[1:03:08] They forgot to pray. They forgot to they
[1:03:11] have family. They forgot everything
[1:03:16] because they have other gods.
[1:03:21] And the Lord said, I testify against you
[1:03:25] this day that ye shall surely perish.
[1:03:30] As the nation which the Lord destroyth
[1:03:32] before your face, so shall ye perish
[1:03:34] because ye would not be obedient unto
[1:03:37] the voice of the Lord your God. We need
[1:03:40] obedience. We need to remember the
[1:03:42] promises of God in our lives. Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Whatever happened in our life, whatever
[1:03:46] we achieve it all by the grace of God in
[1:03:47] our lives.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; So in Exodus 1:6, and Joseph died, and
[1:03:53] all his brethren, and all the
[1:03:55] generation, and the children of Israel
[1:03:57] were fruitful and increased abundantly,
[1:04:00] and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly
[1:04:02] mighty, and the land was filled with
[1:04:03] them. During Joseph reign, everything
[1:04:08] prospered.
[1:04:10] Now there was rose up a new king over
[1:04:12] Egypt which knew not Joseph.
[1:04:17] Notice a golden age of prosperity and
[1:04:20] growth until someone forget the story of
[1:04:22] how God deliver his people. This is type
[1:04:25] of Joseph. Then the whole nation of
[1:04:27] Israel suffered and the entire nation of
[1:04:29] Egypt was destroyed because
[1:04:33] of one man for God.
[1:04:37] What a lesson it is for us. So that's
[1:04:40] why Jude catches up and he wrote it in
[1:04:43] Jude chapter 1 verse5. I will therefore
[1:04:46] put you in remembrance.
[1:04:48] Though you once knew this, how that the
[1:04:50] Lord having saved the people out of the
[1:04:52] land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them
[1:04:56] that believe not. So, Joseph, the judges
[1:04:59] and Jude all these three speaks of the
[1:05:02] importance of remembrance as well as
[1:05:04] many other places in the Bible
[1:05:07] remembering the Lord.
[1:05:10] People fail because they believe not
[1:05:14] and they believe not because they have
[1:05:16] forgotten and they have forgotten
[1:05:18] because they were failed to be reminded.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; So, faith cometh by being reminded.
[1:05:24] Faith cometh by hearing the word of God.
[1:05:27] That's why preachers we have services
[1:05:29] Sunday, Wednesday to be reminded of the
[1:05:33] promises of God in our day.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Because faith cometh by
[1:05:37] hearing and that hearing by the word of
[1:05:39] God we are being reminded every services
[1:05:42] of the promises of God in our lives of
[1:05:45] what he things that he has done
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; and what he's doing and he continue to
[1:05:51] do. It was the grace of God. Amen. So to
[1:05:55] the evening live fellowships family I
[1:05:57] want to say thank you for standing
[1:06:01] serving believing and loving together
[1:06:03] while we enter the new year.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Let us pray for one another. Let us try
[1:06:07] let us continue on and move on.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody be left behind. Let us
[1:06:14] continue on.
[1:06:16] Just like Joshua, he said, "I was 40
[1:06:19] years old when Moses sent me to spy the
[1:06:22] land
[1:06:23] and I brought him the evidence that the
[1:06:25] land is good.
[1:06:28] But now
[1:06:29] I am 85 years old, but I'm still as
[1:06:33] strong as when Moses give me the
[1:06:35] promises." Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; So that's why in myself I may have the
[1:06:40] tear and tears of the age but the joy of
[1:06:44] the Lord is still my strength.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; I am still praise God
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; have strength since I meet praise God
[1:06:51] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THE SAME
[1:06:53] STRENGTH THE SAME JOY WHEN I RECEIVE THE
[1:06:55] MESSAGE is the same joy up to now.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; As Joshua said that for me and my house
[1:07:06] we will serve the Lord.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; We need to have the joy in our heart to
[1:07:11] continue on.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; The joy of knowing that you are a part
[1:07:16] of God that the know of knowing praise
[1:07:18] God there your sin is forgiven. The joy
[1:07:21] of knowing that your sin is being thrown
[1:07:23] in the sea of forgetfulness never to be
[1:07:26] remembered again. THE JOY OF KNOWING
[1:07:29] THAT ONE OF THIS DAY THE BODY CHANGE
[1:07:31] will start because we have already heard
[1:07:33] a shout. We have already heard a voice.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. We need to
[1:07:38] continue moving on and remembering
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; that we have a sure word promise in this
[1:07:44] lesson. God bless you.

[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Ray.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:33] Well, as a new year comes,
[1:08:38] I have to
[1:08:40] put it in my heart to ask you a
[1:08:41] question.
[1:08:43] If you find yourself a year ago in the
[1:08:46] same condition today
[1:08:50] and then
[1:08:52] what does that say of your walk with
[1:08:54] Christ?
[1:08:57] Think about that.
[1:09:01] This song I'm about to sing, it's in
[1:09:03] Spanish. And
[1:09:06] I'm glad I didn't get to sing first
[1:09:08] because the devil was really messing
[1:09:09] with me and I was like, "Wait, what?" I
[1:09:11] couldn't even remember what. So, calm my
[1:09:13] spirit down, my Lord, and pray for me.
[1:09:39] Are you the
[1:09:41] kid?
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Y [singing]

[1:12:53] will whisper.
[1:12:56] Sometimes it roars like thunder.
[1:13:00] Sometimes it [singing and music] grips
[1:13:02] my soul and won't let go.
[1:13:08] Sometimes [singing and music] I think
[1:13:10] I'm worthless.
[1:13:12] That voice is so relentless. [singing]

[1:15:38] Take me back to Calary. [singing]
[1:15:43] Oh, ab what bound [music] this

[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Martin, if you would come.
[1:17:16] Amen.
[1:17:37] Bless your sense.
[1:17:40] Lord bless you. We shall take the Bible
[1:17:43] quickly.
[1:17:50] That might not be uh
[1:17:53] long at all. Maybe five 10 minutes.
[1:17:57] But that's grace.
[1:17:59] uh 2 Chronicles 20:20.
[1:18:05] And they rose early in the morning and
[1:18:08] went forth into the wilderness of uh
[1:18:10] Teora. And as they went forth,
[1:18:13] Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, O
[1:18:16] Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,
[1:18:19] believe in the Lord your God, so ye
[1:18:23] shall be established.
[1:18:26] Believe he is prophet." So shall ye
[1:18:29] prosper. May the Lord bless the reading
[1:18:31] of his word. You may be seated. Uh it is
[1:18:35] uh a privilege, a grace once again to be
[1:18:41] in the house of the Lord at the year
[1:18:43] end.
[1:18:45] uh like uh to take the opportunity to
[1:18:48] excuse myself
[1:18:50] because I believe uh last time I was
[1:18:53] here seems like the communication was
[1:18:55] not clear to everybody uh since I said
[1:18:59] that I was having some uh taking new
[1:19:03] assignments for work but seems like it
[1:19:05] didn't translate properly and uh seems
[1:19:07] like there was a lot of questions what's
[1:19:10] going on and what's happening but
[1:19:12] forgive me for that I believe Next time
[1:19:15] we'll try to maybe uh give a little bit
[1:19:18] more information and also want to thank
[1:19:21] you all for uh the support of the church
[1:19:25] and uh everybody uh throughout uh uh the
[1:19:29] time my wife and I as we were expecting
[1:19:32] I mean she was expecting
[1:19:36] uh the Lord has blessed us with uh a
[1:19:39] little boy and uh a new wonderful
[1:19:42] experience By God's grace, uh we believe
[1:19:46] that uh your continuing support in
[1:19:49] prayer uh in everything uh is certainly
[1:19:53] welcome. Uh for tonight, I might not
[1:19:56] take uh as much time. Believe uh we'll
[1:20:00] leave the rest of the time for later on
[1:20:03] because uh all this time as I promised
[1:20:06] you before leaving when we're finishing
[1:20:10] uh what house will thou build me? uh the
[1:20:13] Lord had on my heart few subject
[1:20:16] Jeremiah's
[1:20:18] ministry that we'll be covering um
[1:20:22] God in hearts and uh
[1:20:26] uh wisdom and his child but I believe
[1:20:29] that uh the time for the time being it's
[1:20:31] going to be uh Jeremiah's ministry
[1:20:35] uh we might have to break it into uh
[1:20:38] three sections and every uh section with
[1:20:42] few parts. So, you're going to bear with
[1:20:44] me. So, we're going to take one step at
[1:20:47] a time. Uh there's no need to rush
[1:20:50] because we want to make our
[1:20:52] communication clear so that it's not
[1:20:54] misinterpreted,
[1:20:56] misunderstood by God's grace. So,
[1:20:58] therefore, for tonight, it's just a
[1:21:00] little overview of the mother Jeremiah's
[1:21:02] ministry and then uh we'll go about for
[1:21:07] tonight and uh happy new year. God bless
[1:21:10] you so much for all
[1:21:12] Uh thank you brotheron for the
[1:21:14] opportunity once again and uh everybody
[1:21:18] was uh asking me what is what was
[1:21:21] happening. Um we see that in the Bible
[1:21:26] uh the word of the lord come uh comes to
[1:21:29] the prophet
[1:21:31] uh as it comes to the prophet it is uh
[1:21:34] important for us to receive uh that
[1:21:37] precious word and uh go about it. That's
[1:21:40] why uh as we are reading here uh because
[1:21:45] the whole uh series that we'll be diving
[1:21:49] into is basically tied to
[1:21:53] uh what Jehoshaphat says here. I said,
[1:21:57] "Hear me, oh Judah, as I would say the
[1:22:00] bride, the church, uh, ye inhabitants of
[1:22:04] Jerusalem.
[1:22:05] Believe in the Lord your God, so shall
[1:22:09] he be established." You have the first
[1:22:11] part, you have to believe in God. And
[1:22:14] you have the second part, believe his
[1:22:17] prophet, so shall ye prosper.
[1:22:21] uh when we come u to the Lord certainly
[1:22:24] uh everybody else out there brother
[1:22:27] shows us that u uh people make it so
[1:22:31] hard about what it is to receive the
[1:22:34] Lord they will tell you you have to do
[1:22:37] left and right up and down but it says
[1:22:39] like if you can just challenge gravity
[1:22:42] when the word comes that's it
[1:22:46] at times is
[1:22:49] Well, there's nothing really that I can
[1:22:51] do. No, there's nothing you have to do
[1:22:54] because the scripture clearly says you
[1:22:56] just have to believe him.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And as simple as that beginning of
[1:23:02] believing and that principles remain
[1:23:07] believe all the way. That's why when the
[1:23:10] prophet came about it says only believe
[1:23:14] and that by believing we may think that
[1:23:17] well that belief has to go according to
[1:23:20] this church doctrine and according to
[1:23:23] that no he says believe his prophet you
[1:23:26] shall prosper by believing him he gives
[1:23:30] you eternal life
[1:23:32] it's not something a man will have to
[1:23:35] push you to show you how to receive
[1:23:38] eternal
[1:23:39] You just have to believe him. And we
[1:23:41] like to make it so hard. We believe
[1:23:44] today and then tomorrow we find ourself
[1:23:46] into things left and right. Then we
[1:23:48] question if we believed
[1:23:51] says the moment that you find yourself
[1:23:53] in that condition
[1:23:55] that means you never been converted.
[1:23:58] But that's why now the king is telling
[1:24:01] him said, "Hey,
[1:24:04] hear me
[1:24:06] as I'm standing today. Hear me out. You
[1:24:10] just have to believe him.
[1:24:12] Everything along the journey. Well, I
[1:24:15] don't see this. I don't understand. This
[1:24:18] is really the message what it's supposed
[1:24:20] to be." You just have to believe.
[1:24:23] And once you believe, he sends his
[1:24:26] prophet. And once he sends a he pray
[1:24:28] he's prophet you can do everything else
[1:24:31] believe him believe God and just walk
[1:24:34] away. But Abraham tells the sister he
[1:24:37] says hey I see that you have a question
[1:24:40] in your heart wondering if uh you're
[1:24:42] still saved. Say God doesn't save you
[1:24:45] today to lose you tomorrow.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And that settles it.
[1:24:54] You just heard him and that's it. He
[1:24:57] settles it. But as human beings, we want
[1:25:01] to feel certain emotions that goes with
[1:25:03] it. A certain uh dream uh uh somebody
[1:25:08] come to tell you, I saw you in a vision
[1:25:10] believing has nothing to do with it.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; As long as you come to him, you must
[1:25:18] believe that he is
[1:25:20] because he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:25:22] and forever.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; If uh Abraham believed in God and he was
[1:25:29] imputed unto him for righteousness, so
[1:25:32] shall it be with you.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; But then now our human part likes to
[1:25:39] push ourself
[1:25:41] to do something
[1:25:43] that I have to go to church.
[1:25:48] I know it's hard. Well, if you I believe
[1:25:50] I have to go to church. Yes, that's
[1:25:52] true. But it's it's not the requirement
[1:25:54] to be saved
[1:25:57] because brother Brham says Lot was saved
[1:26:02] being there in the uh stranger land, but
[1:26:05] he was saved.
[1:26:07] He says, well, he brought a lot of uh
[1:26:10] shame to the word, but nevertheless,
[1:26:13] he's saved.
[1:26:17] Believe in God, you shall be established
[1:26:21] because that eternal life, it's God's
[1:26:24] own life.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; It's an eternal life.
[1:26:29] And he gives it to whom he willth.
[1:26:32] And by him giving that life, it's not a
[1:26:36] matter of uh you becoming
[1:26:40] putting your effort into into it.
[1:26:44] I know parents we like to feel that our
[1:26:48] children are saved by bringing them to
[1:26:51] church or serving in the house of the
[1:26:54] Lord and all that that has nothing to do
[1:26:56] with it because Manoak and his wife
[1:27:00] wondered about what Solomon uh Samson
[1:27:03] why was he doing all these things
[1:27:06] but they forget that God gave them the
[1:27:09] child
[1:27:11] and that's how the pastors like to
[1:27:12] filled a all the seats are filled
[1:27:16] but that doesn't contradict the word
[1:27:19] well Martin does it mean that we have to
[1:27:21] go and live however you want no
[1:27:25] because that very life that's the life
[1:27:28] that we see in the seven church ages
[1:27:31] he says like I know thy works
[1:27:35] because he is the first one that began
[1:27:37] in Genesis one I mean in revelation one
[1:27:41] the one that died for you and I'm here
[1:27:44] and along the journey I'll be with you.
[1:27:47] Because if he's unable to be with you
[1:27:50] along the church ages, that means that
[1:27:52] you never been saved to begin with.
[1:27:56] Believe the Lord your God, you shall be
[1:27:59] established.
[1:28:00] And for him, for you now to prosper, he
[1:28:04] comes and gives you the prophets
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; by believing him.
[1:28:11] You have eternal life. But for you to
[1:28:14] prosper, you must believe his prophet.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And the prophet, the very life of the
[1:28:21] prophet is the word manifest for the
[1:28:25] age.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Because Jeremiah,
[1:28:29] God told him, raise up,
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; go do such a thing. That will be the
[1:28:34] outcome of Israel.
[1:28:37] They thought that Jeremiah was crazy,
[1:28:41] but they didn't see that Jeremiah's life
[1:28:44] was the very word of God in their day.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; If Jeremiah told them that this is the
[1:28:51] path to go and you're going into bondage
[1:28:55] and today the prophet shall also tell us
[1:28:58] what we have to do in order for us to
[1:29:01] end up in hell or in heaven. And he
[1:29:04] says, "See,
[1:29:06] as far as I'm concerned, people make it
[1:29:08] so hard.
[1:29:11] But if you can believe him,
[1:29:15] but we don't like to believe. We like to
[1:29:16] reason."
[1:29:19] We stand with re our reasoning. Oh, you
[1:29:22] should have been this way. Oh, that this
[1:29:25] is along the way. But then all those
[1:29:27] details we'll see that Jeremiah
[1:29:31] uh in uh Jeremiah 1 it say that then the
[1:29:35] word of the Lord came unto me saying
[1:29:40] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[1:29:43] thee
[1:29:46] because when we come to that point of
[1:29:48] believing it's not the result of our own
[1:29:52] desire nobody
[1:29:55] can come to me unless
[1:29:58] my father draws him first.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; And for him to draw us, it's because he
[1:30:05] knew us before the foundation of the
[1:30:07] world.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; And by knowing us, he knows in what time
[1:30:11] is he going to bring us in
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; and what we shall go through.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; And the way God operates as he did, I
[1:30:20] believe uh in Exodus 19, they came and
[1:30:23] said like, you know, we want to talk to
[1:30:24] God. God came talking to them. They
[1:30:27] couldn't hear him. So God established a
[1:30:31] pattern
[1:30:32] and said, "I'll speak to Moses and Moses
[1:30:35] will speak with you."
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Because they knew that Moses came to
[1:30:42] free us. But now they want to find
[1:30:46] themselves as if they were co-equal with
[1:30:50] Moses in God's program.
[1:30:55] They were wanting to have a position
[1:30:58] differently than what God has given
[1:31:00] them.
[1:31:02] That's why God is saying believe him
[1:31:06] and ye shall prosper.
[1:31:09] Quran and said like you know well you
[1:31:11] want to lift yourself higher than any
[1:31:13] one of us. All of us we have the
[1:31:15] ministry. Yes you have a ministry but
[1:31:17] your position is different. Yes sir.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Therefore, your success is bound by you
[1:31:25] believing his prophets.
[1:31:29] Before the foundation of the world, I
[1:31:31] knew thee.
[1:31:34] Before thou camest forth out of the
[1:31:37] womb, I sanctified thee.
[1:31:42] Well, I have to do this. I have to do
[1:31:44] that. No. God is telling us, "Believe
[1:31:48] me, you shall be established."
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Because he already done it. It's a
[1:31:53] finished work.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus was uh
[1:31:59] slain before the foundation of the
[1:32:00] world.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And the manifestation of it, brother
[1:32:05] says, "You were not saved the day you
[1:32:08] are believing it."
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with it.
[1:32:15] But then now the seed word when it comes
[1:32:19] it said like it's not a person that is
[1:32:21] predestinated but it is the seed word
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; that is predestinated
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; and once the seed comes into view now it
[1:32:32] gets into the land.
[1:32:35] Therefore, that's why he tells Jeremiah.
[1:32:38] He said,
[1:32:42] "Then Jeremiah started uh um excusing,
[1:32:45] presenting excuses." It says then I said
[1:32:49] ah Lord Lord God behold I cannot speak
[1:32:52] for I am a child but the Lord said unto
[1:32:55] me saying
[1:32:58] say not I am a child
[1:33:01] for thou shalt go shall go to all the
[1:33:04] that I shall send thee and whatsoever I
[1:33:07] command thee thou shalt speak. Be not
[1:33:10] afraid of their faces, for I am with I
[1:33:14] am with thee to deliver thee with said
[1:33:17] the Lord. Then the Lord put forth his
[1:33:19] hand and touch my mouth. And the Lord
[1:33:21] has said unto me, Behold, I have put my
[1:33:23] words in thy mouth. See, I have uh I
[1:33:27] have this day set thee over the nations,
[1:33:31] over the kingdoms to root out. That's
[1:33:35] Jeremiah's ministry. for him for people
[1:33:39] to prosper when that seed word comes
[1:33:42] into place
[1:33:44] that's why I brought the question of uh
[1:33:47] Lot
[1:33:49] because though we are saved
[1:33:54] we can see Lot's life though we are
[1:33:57] saved though we shall for us to be able
[1:33:59] to know how to prosper
[1:34:02] Jeremiah has to do a certain work
[1:34:05] and it's not always an easy work
[1:34:09] to root out to pull down to destroy
[1:34:15] and that's our comfortable zone.
[1:34:18] We don't like we don't like to shake to
[1:34:20] get out of our comfortable zone.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. Jesus would the way
[1:34:26] I know the word
[1:34:28] and it is a beautiful work to do with
[1:34:31] this precious message whereby we see the
[1:34:34] prophet take that word and go about it
[1:34:38] into details
[1:34:41] work with people
[1:34:43] from all their conditions from their
[1:34:47] flesh and the clothing the the mind
[1:34:50] everything that goes in the minds and it
[1:34:52] goes into the soul and dealing with all
[1:34:55] those things
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; that means now for the person to
[1:35:01] prosper.
[1:35:04] Burnham says uh when uh he preached I
[1:35:08] believe uh why is it so hard for people
[1:35:10] to live a Christian life he say you see
[1:35:14] you have eternal life but at times those
[1:35:18] children once you're born will have the
[1:35:20] time to read those quotations once
[1:35:23] you're born at times when you don't
[1:35:26] follow the word you are living under
[1:35:29] your privilege
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; and because of that you are losing
[1:35:33] losing the children reward.
[1:35:36] That's why it says here that believe his
[1:35:40] prophet
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; and you shall do what? Prosper.
[1:35:45] Because in that prosperity there are
[1:35:47] principles that are applied placed in
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; how to approach divine healing, how to
[1:35:53] approach marriage, how to approach the
[1:35:56] church, how to approach the ministry.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; All that
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; is bound into this. Believe the Lord
[1:36:04] your God, you shall be established.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; But then for you to prosper,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; you shall be what? prosper.
[1:36:15] You are established by believing God.
[1:36:17] But for you to prosper because many of
[1:36:21] us will see that we have we go through
[1:36:24] all kind of things.
[1:36:27] I believe the word but I don't see this
[1:36:29] changing. I believe the word but I don't
[1:36:31] see me progressing in the revelation.
[1:36:34] Each person
[1:36:36] is in a uh a certain stage
[1:36:40] and all those stages are covered by
[1:36:43] Jeremiah
[1:36:45] because he's coming to pull down to
[1:36:48] destroy.
[1:36:51] And we know that spirits don't change.
[1:36:57] When you start seeing a resentment, a
[1:37:00] fight back,
[1:37:01] you go back to the word, you know that
[1:37:04] spirit.
[1:37:06] When you see makeups and you see high
[1:37:08] heels, you know where all those spirits
[1:37:10] came forth.
[1:37:13] Then now the prophets now start taking
[1:37:15] those things one step at a time. He
[1:37:18] start showing them until he calls them
[1:37:20] denominations and then he calls the
[1:37:23] other the bride.
[1:37:28] And uh for those now who are called the
[1:37:30] bride, it's because they've come along a
[1:37:34] certain journey
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; because in Joshua 1, it tells Joshua
[1:37:39] said, "As I was with Moses, so shall I
[1:37:43] be with you." But for him, Joshua, to
[1:37:47] know how God is going to deal with him,
[1:37:50] it's because he's set with Moses all
[1:37:53] these years.
[1:37:57] And you can see the demographic or the
[1:38:00] ratio in the demographic that followed
[1:38:02] Moses first.
[1:38:04] We're not saying that they lost,
[1:38:07] but here now the prosperity, the
[1:38:10] success, only two out of a two out of a
[1:38:14] million
[1:38:16] was able to make it. Believe him. That's
[1:38:20] why the prophet says, you see,
[1:38:23] if you don't obey what I tell you, that
[1:38:27] means you don't believe.
[1:38:31] And all these records are set in the
[1:38:35] word from 47 to 65.
[1:38:38] And you can see the pattern as the
[1:38:40] prophet is working along these years.
[1:38:44] He's showing them look at you
[1:38:46] Pentecostals, look at you Baptist, look
[1:38:49] at you fundamentalist, look at you
[1:38:52] spiritual always zeals. And all those
[1:38:55] people is taking them one step at a time
[1:38:59] how to go about these things and how to
[1:39:02] get to the images of Christ
[1:39:06] because God has ease of putting forth
[1:39:10] his word. He said like you know you say
[1:39:13] that you believe me I believe you but
[1:39:15] every child that has to come to God must
[1:39:18] be tried and tested.
[1:39:21] And that testing, that's Jeremiah's
[1:39:23] ministry. He's pulling down.
[1:39:26] He's breaking
[1:39:28] so that at the end he can present a
[1:39:31] bride spotless.
[1:39:37] And that that that work is not an easy
[1:39:39] work.
[1:39:42] And those principles applies in our
[1:39:44] families and in everything in work and
[1:39:47] countries and all these things.
[1:39:50] When Jeremiah came and told America,
[1:39:52] "This is the way to go." America
[1:39:54] rejected it.
[1:39:57] By the first value, it seems like it's
[1:39:59] still going good.
[1:40:04] But very quickly, he says like, you
[1:40:05] know, hey, this is already finished.
[1:40:08] There will be a judgment. He says either
[1:40:11] it's going to be a depression
[1:40:14] or it's going to be just a bomb and to
[1:40:16] take it out.
[1:40:19] And when we look at all these things, it
[1:40:21] will hurt anybody
[1:40:23] being an American to see the homeland
[1:40:27] that has been built and that has been
[1:40:29] done all these this work being done to
[1:40:32] come up to that destruction.
[1:40:35] So it is also with us. You come to
[1:40:38] church and you attending, you sing song
[1:40:41] and you preach and all these things and
[1:40:43] then at the end to be rejected
[1:40:46] because they didn't believe Jeremiah.
[1:40:51] May the Lord bless you.
[1:40:54] [applause]
[1:41:00] Thank you, brother Martin. Amen. Sister
[1:41:02] Deborah, if you'd come and sing for us
[1:41:04] and then after Sister Deborah, Sister
[1:41:06] Perfect, if you could come right away,
[1:41:08] as soon as Sister Deborah is done, and
[1:41:10] then once Sister Perfect is done, we'll
[1:41:12] have Brother James come and brother
[1:41:13] James will speak for us. Amen. Sister
[1:41:16] Deborah, God bless you.
[1:41:46] The time has come.
[1:41:51] Divine [singing] revelation
[1:41:54] in God's word.
[1:41:58] His
[1:42:01] [singing]
[1:42:02] grace I see
[1:42:07] when I see how he has chosen
[1:42:10] [singing and music]
[1:42:11] me.
[1:42:17] And it happens [singing]
[1:42:19] every day
[1:42:22] when I begin to pray.
[1:42:25] It burns [singing] within my heart
[1:42:29] the things he always says. He revealth
[1:42:33] [singing]
[1:42:34] unto me
[1:42:37] [music] what I was born to [singing] be
[1:42:40] in this day.
[1:42:47] So I'm staying on
[1:42:51] my [singing]
[1:42:53] knees, patiently waiting [singing] on
[1:42:58] [music] my
[1:43:00] knees.
[1:43:02] For your outpouring on [singing]
[1:43:06] my
[1:43:08] knees, [music]
[1:43:10] Lord, I meet you on
[1:43:14] my [singing]
[1:43:16] knees.
[1:43:19] Now I believe
[1:43:22] [singing and music]
[1:43:24] that I was born a predestinated
[1:43:28] [singing]
[1:43:28] sea. [music]
[1:43:33] Oh [singing] amazing [music] grace
[1:43:39] has chosen [singing]
[1:43:41] me to run this [music] race.
[1:43:48] So [singing] I will give my life to help
[1:43:53] perfected without [singing] sin. I can't
[1:43:57] do this on my own. Lord, put flesh on
[1:44:01] these [singing] dry bones. [music] If it
[1:44:04] takes my life to give, [singing]
[1:44:07] then for you I will live. I need you,
[1:44:11] [music]
[1:44:12] Lord.
[1:44:13] Oh,
[1:44:16] [singing] so I'm staying on [music]
[1:44:21] my
[1:44:22] knees, patiently [singing] waiting on
[1:44:28] my
[1:44:30] knees.
[1:44:31] for your [singing] outpouring [music] on
[1:44:35] my
[1:44:37] knees.
[1:44:39] Oh Lord, I need you on [singing]
[1:44:43] my [music]
[1:44:44] knees.
[1:44:47] I've read [singing] the scriptures in
[1:44:50] the Bible about the mighty gentile
[1:44:54] warrior,
[1:44:55] the painful desire of Hannah
[1:44:59] and the [singing] fearless move of
[1:45:01] Esther. Lord, I believe that they were
[1:45:05] true [singing]
[1:45:06] and the token they receive. But what
[1:45:10] about [singing]
[1:45:11] me?
[1:45:15] [music]
[1:45:16] I [singing] know my battles are all won.
[1:45:21] That's why I sing my song.
[1:45:23] [singing and music]
[1:45:24] And I know blessings are all mine.
[1:45:28] [singing] But it will just take time. So
[1:45:31] like Elijah, here I [singing] stay
[1:45:35] with faith in such a way to [music] know
[1:45:39] you could.
[1:45:44] [singing]
[1:45:45] So I'm [music] staying on
[1:45:49] my [singing]
[1:45:50] knees, patiently waiting on
[1:45:55] [singing and music]
[1:45:56] my
[1:45:58] knees for your outpouring [singing]
[1:46:02] on
[1:46:03] my
[1:46:05] knees.
[1:46:07] Oh Lord, [singing] I need you on
[1:46:11] my
[1:46:12] knees. [music]
[1:46:14] So [singing] I'm staying on
[1:46:18] my
[1:46:20] knees, [music]
[1:46:21] patiently waiting [singing] on
[1:46:26] my
[1:46:27] knees for your [singing] outpouring on
[1:46:32] [music]
[1:46:33] my
[1:46:35] knees. [singing]
[1:46:36] Oh Lord, I need you on
[1:46:41] my
[1:46:43] knees.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:46:45] [applause]
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:47:22] Just like Shem in the Bible, with all he
[1:47:27] [singing] went through, [music] he
[1:47:29] fought by faith with God by his side
[1:47:34] [singing]
[1:47:36] overcoming his enemies. In one day, God
[1:47:41] lifted [music and singing] him. He was
[1:47:43] the evidence that God conquers.
[1:47:46] [music and singing] So,
[1:47:49] you are the evidence of the [music]
[1:47:52] truth. Yes, the evidence [singing] of
[1:47:55] his word. Don't give up, no give in. He
[1:48:00] has [singing] given us the key. Oh
[1:48:04] Satan, you are [music] late. Whatever
[1:48:06] you throw at us won't [singing] last.
[1:48:09] You are dealing with a victorious
[1:48:13] ride. [music and singing]
[1:48:15] Oh, we are the evidence of the truth.
[1:48:19] Yes, the evidence of his [music] word.
[1:48:22] Don't give up, no give [singing] in. He
[1:48:26] has given us the [music] key. Oh Satan,
[1:48:30] you are late. Whatever you throw at us
[1:48:34] won't last. You are dealing with a
[1:48:38] victorious [singing]
[1:48:39] cry.
[1:48:41] [music] We are reminded of Hannah. She
[1:48:46] cried [music and singing] all day and
[1:48:47] night. Oh Lord,
[1:48:50] do not pass me by.
[1:48:55] Through her praise and [music]
[1:48:56] supplications,
[1:48:58] our God delivered her and by faith she
[1:49:03] held the evidence in [singing] her arms.
[1:49:06] Oh, we are the evidence of the truth.
[1:49:10] Yes, the evidence of his word. Don't
[1:49:14] give up nor give [music and singing] in.
[1:49:17] He has given us the key. Oh, Satan, you
[1:49:22] are late. Whatever [music] you throw at
[1:49:24] us won't last. You are dealing with a
[1:49:28] victorious [music and singing]
[1:49:30] bride.
[1:49:32] Now in our lives, we've seen it [music]
[1:49:35] all. The ups and downs, the pain, the
[1:49:38] grief, and now God has been by our side.
[1:49:43] [singing]
[1:49:45] It's not by chance we've [music]
[1:49:46] conquered.
[1:49:48] But by grace and grace alone, we are the
[1:49:52] evidence that God is still alive.
[1:49:57] Oh, we are the [music] evidence of the
[1:50:00] truth. Yes, the evidence of his word.
[1:50:04] Don't give up, [music] nor give in.
[1:50:07] [singing] He has given us the key. Oh,
[1:50:11] Satan, you are late. [music and singing]
[1:50:13] Whatever you throw at us won't last. You
[1:50:16] are dealing with a victorious [music]
[1:50:20] fight.
[1:50:22] Oh, we are the evidence of the truth.
[1:50:25] [music] Yes. The evidence of his word.
[1:50:29] Don't give up nor give in. [singing]
[1:50:32] He has given us the key. Oh Satan, you
[1:50:37] are late. [music] Whatever you throw at
[1:50:39] us won't last. You are dealing with a
[1:50:43] victorious [music and singing]
[1:50:45] bride.
[1:50:46] Oh, you are dealing with a victorious
[1:50:51] bride.
[1:50:57] [applause and music]
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand to our feet.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; We are the evidence.
[1:51:09] Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; All right, let's turn in our Bibles
[1:51:25] to Luke 2.
[1:51:29] Luke chapter 2 and verse 46.
[1:51:39] And if you say amen fast, I'll try to
[1:51:41] preach fast and we'll get brother Ron up
[1:51:43] here.
[1:51:46] Just a little thought this evening of
[1:51:48] unfinished business.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Unfinished business. And so we see here
[1:51:53] in Luke 2 and uh verse 46. And it came
[1:51:56] to pass that after 3 days they were
[1:51:57] found they found him in the temple
[1:51:59] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[1:52:02] hearing them and asking them questions.
[1:52:04] And all that heard him were astonished
[1:52:08] at his understanding and answers.
[1:52:12] And when he saw him, they were amazed.
[1:52:14] And his mother and said unto him, Son,
[1:52:17] why hast thou thus dealt with us?
[1:52:19] Behold, thy father and thy mother have
[1:52:21] sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto
[1:52:23] them, "How is it thee that thee has
[1:52:26] sought me? Wit he not know that I must
[1:52:29] be about my father's business?" And they
[1:52:32] understood not the sayings which he
[1:52:34] spake unto him. You can have your seats
[1:52:37] this evening. And he said unto them,
[1:52:40] "How is it that you had sought me which
[1:52:42] you know that I must be about my
[1:52:44] father's business?" So we know that
[1:52:45] Jesus was here in the temple and he was
[1:52:48] talking at the age of 12 and the age of
[1:52:51] accountability and you know they
[1:52:54] misunderstood him
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; because the B brother Brandham says that
[1:52:58] the Bible always corrects the air.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; And when and when Mary here said you you
[1:53:04] must he said I must be about my father's
[1:53:06] business. Well if he was about Joseph's
[1:53:08] business he would be a carpenter over in
[1:53:10] a carpenter shop. He would be serving
[1:53:12] him doing that. But there was a greater
[1:53:14] thing. There was a greater master that
[1:53:16] he was serving. There was more important
[1:53:18] business that he had to do.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; And so we understand that they said that
[1:53:23] I must be about my father's business.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says the the seed
[1:53:29] is not heir with the shuck. He said the
[1:53:30] word yet young spake for itself and know
[1:53:33] not not that I must be about my father's
[1:53:36] business. He says there is the secret of
[1:53:38] the message. Now he says JUST EXACTLY
[1:53:41] THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. What is the
[1:53:44] FATHER'S BUSINESS? IF WE WERE TO STOP
[1:53:46] right there, what is the father's
[1:53:47] business to you this evening? IS IT JUST
[1:53:50] GOING TO CHURCH AND PAYING YOUR TITHES
[1:53:52] AND DOING YOUR DUE DILIGENCE? WHAT is
[1:53:54] the father's business this evening?
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Because you can read all down through
[1:53:58] the scriptures and here brother Brandon
[1:54:00] begins to think uh to quote here. He
[1:54:02] says, "Could you think of what the
[1:54:03] father's business was in him? It was to
[1:54:06] fulfill what ISA ISAIAH SAID, "A VIRGIN
[1:54:09] shall conceive." HE SAID, "FULFILL WHAT
[1:54:12] ISAIAH said again, that the lame shall
[1:54:14] leap like a heart." He said, "All these
[1:54:16] things would would take place." Like
[1:54:18] Moses said, "The Lord your God shall
[1:54:20] raise up a prophet among you likened
[1:54:22] unto me." It was the father's business
[1:54:25] to fulfill the word.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; It was the father's business to fulfill
[1:54:29] the word. AND AS I READ ALL DOWN THROUGH
[1:54:31] SCRIPTURE, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FATHER'S
[1:54:33] BUSINESS AND HIM FULFILLING HIS OWN
[1:54:35] WORD. AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS EVENING,
[1:54:38] IT'S STILL GOD'S BUSINESS. IT'S STILL
[1:54:40] THE FATHER'S BUSINESS TO FULFILL his
[1:54:42] word.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT UP TO YOU AND IT'S NOT UP TO
[1:54:47] ME. WE DON'T HAVE TO MANUFACTURE
[1:54:49] CHRISTIANITY AND WE HAVE TO WORK
[1:54:51] SOMETHING UP. NO, IT'S THE FATHER'S
[1:54:53] BUSINESS TO FULFILL HIS own word.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Yes, it is.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THEN. HE SAYS, "THEN WHAT IS IT
[1:55:01] NOW? WE MUST BE ABOUT THE FATHER'S
[1:55:03] BUSINESS." HE SAYS, "YES, SIR. WHAT MUST
[1:55:06] IT DO?" HE SAYS, "VINDICATE." MALACHI
[1:55:08] 4:5. LET ME ASK YOU, HAVE THESE THINGS
[1:55:10] HAPPENED? MALACHI 4:5, LUKE 17:30,
[1:55:14] HEBREWS 13:8, UH, ST. JOHN 14:12. WHAT
[1:55:19] IS IT THE GREATER WORK THAT IS HAPPENING
[1:55:21] IN YOU AND ME? AMEN.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; What did I DO?
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; VINDICATED ALL in his word.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; REVELATIONS 10 UH CHAPTER 10, THE
[1:55:31] OPENING of the seals, the mysteries OF
[1:55:33] GOD, EVEN SERPENT SEED AND ALL ALL THESE
[1:55:35] THINGS THAT WOULD BE MANIFEST. MARRIAGE
[1:55:38] AND DIVORCE AND ALL THESE MYSTERIES THAT
[1:55:40] HAVE been hid under the pillars all
[1:55:42] these years from theologians AND SO
[1:55:44] FORTH. WHAT IS IT'S NOW THE HOUR.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; That's the father's business. It's no
[1:55:51] more WONDERING WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE
[1:55:53] FATHER ALL ABOUT? AND SHOULD WE WONDER
[1:55:55] WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; NO. The father's business. NO, WE KNOW
[1:55:59] EXACTLY what it's about.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; It was THE FATHER'S BUSINESS PAST TENSE
[1:56:07] AND IT'S STILL THE FATHER'S business in
[1:56:10] present tense.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; And it's up to God to fulfill
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; his business. So let me ASK YOU IF THE
[1:56:21] FATHER'S BUSINESS IS TO FULFILL HIS WORD
[1:56:23] AND WE HEAR IT PREACHED OVER AND OVER
[1:56:25] AND ALL THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT YOU ARE
[1:56:27] THE WORD BRIDE. YOU ARE THE WORD
[1:56:29] BECOMING MADE FLESH. THE WORD IS COMING
[1:56:32] INTO MA MANIFESTATION. WHAT IS IT?
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; The word being made flesh. AND IF GO
[1:56:42] IT'S GOD'S DUTY AND HIS OBLIGATION TO
[1:56:45] MANIFEST HIS OWN WORD AND THAT'S HIS
[1:56:47] BUSINESS. WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU?
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE GOD'S BUSINESS. MAKE IT PERSONAL
[1:56:52] TO YOU.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; I AM THE father's business.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; I AM THE FATHER'S BUSINESS.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; In St. JOHN 10 AND 37, HE SAYS, "IF I DO
[1:57:09] NOT THE WORKS of my father, believe me
[1:57:11] not. But if I do, though you believe me
[1:57:13] not, believe the works that you may know
[1:57:15] and believe that the Father is in me and
[1:57:18] I in him.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; You will do the works whether you
[1:57:26] believe it or not.
[1:57:28] Let me tell YOU THAT WE HAD A PROPHET,
[1:57:30] VINDICATED PROPHET THAT CAME IN THIS DAY
[1:57:32] AND YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE NAYSAYERS. YOU
[1:57:34] CAN HAVE EVERYBODY SAY WHAT THEY WANT.
[1:57:38] IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHAT HE SAYS,
[1:57:39] BELIEVE THE WORKS THAT FOLLOWED AFTER
[1:57:41] HIM. BELIEVE THE PROPHECIES THAT HE
[1:57:43] SPOKE AND THE THINGS THAT WERE COMING TO
[1:57:45] PASS.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "All that the father hath
[1:57:49] given me will come."
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; What is it now that there are still ones
[1:57:54] THAT ARE STILL COMING, BACKSLIDERS
[1:57:56] COMING BACK TO US?
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; SOULS TO BE SAVED,
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; LIVES TO BE TOUCHED.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. AS I WAS
[1:58:04] HEARING THE PROPHET SPEAK TODAY, WHAT IS
[1:58:07] THE MOST IMPORTANT THING?
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; THE FATHER'S BUSINESS IS SOULS BEING
[1:58:12] SAVED TO HIS KINGDOM.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS UNFINISHED BUSINESS. THAT'S WHY
[1:58:21] YOU AND I ARE HERE TODAY.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE HIS WORK ISN'T FINISHED.
[1:58:26] THERE'S THINGS IN OUR LIVES AND
[1:58:28] CIRCUMSTANCES AND YEAH, THOUGH WE GO
[1:58:30] THROUGH THINGS AND THERE'S ONES THAT
[1:58:32] HAVE CANCER AND SICKNESS AND ALL THAT,
[1:58:34] BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS EVENING, GOD'S
[1:58:35] NOT DONE WITH YOU.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; THE WORK ISN'T FINISHED YET.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE THE FAMILY SITUATION. I
[1:58:43] DON'T CARE THE BACKSLIDEN CHILDREN. LET
[1:58:45] ME TELL YOU, GOD HAS UNFINISHED
[1:58:47] BUSINESS. AND WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
[1:58:49] HE'S THE FATHER IS GOING TO FINISH UP
[1:58:50] HIS BUSINESS.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:56] This saying that we have of unfinished
[1:58:58] business, just listen to what this is.
[1:59:01] It means a task or issue matter started
[1:59:04] but completed
[1:59:07] requiring attention, resolution,
[1:59:09] closure, WHETHER IT'S A WORK PROJECT,
[1:59:12] UNRESOLVED CONFLICT,
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; lingering emotion, baggage
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; with someone. That's exactly what it is.
[1:59:22] It's baggage. SAINTS OF GOD, IT'S
[1:59:24] BAGGAGE. LET'S PUT THOSE THINGS BEHIND
[1:59:26] US. LET'S GO TO THOSE ONES MAYBE YOU'VE
[1:59:28] OFFENDED, MAYBE SOMETHING'S IN BETWEEN
[1:59:30] YOU. GO AND FIX THOSE THINGS. Because if
[1:59:33] you WANT TO BE ABOUT THE FATHER'S
[1:59:34] BUSINESS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MEAN
[1:59:36] BUSINESS.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT HERE FOR PLAYING AROUND AND
[1:59:40] PLAYING CHURCH AND YOU'RE IN ONE DAY AND
[1:59:42] OUT THE NEXT. NO, NO, NO.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO DEAL WITH SOMEBODY WHO
[1:59:45] MEANS BUSINESS.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Mario, YOU ALREADY HIT IT. WHAT
[1:59:51] KIND OF BUSINESS PARTNER WOULD YOU BE?
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING FINANCIALLY AND OH WHAT
[1:59:56] YOU CAN DO AND THE MONEY YOU CAN MAKE
[1:59:58] AND THE DEALS YOU CAN DO. NO, I'M NOT
[2:00:00] TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND OF BUSINESS.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS ARE YOU IN YOUR
[2:00:03] CHRISTIAN WALK? ARE YOU A GOOD STEWARD
[2:00:06] of your time? ARE YOU FAITHFUL IN
[2:00:08] EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO? ARE YOU HERE ON
[2:00:09] TIME AND FAITHFUL IN CHURCH?
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Are you willing TO SERVE THE BODY of
[2:00:13] Christ?
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Christianity 101 is LIVING
[2:00:18] FOR OTHERS, SERVING OTHERS.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; That's a truth.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Lingering emotional baggage with
[2:00:32] someone. Even spiritual duties left
[2:00:34] undone. Often carrying a sense of
[2:00:36] obligation. Emotional weight until it's
[2:00:40] dealt with.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Until it's dealt with. Let me tell you,
[2:00:45] at the close of this this year and the
[2:00:47] start of a next, let's leave all that
[2:00:49] baggage behind us.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Let's let all those weights that so
[2:00:53] easily beset US AND LET US RUN THE RACE
[2:00:55] THAT IS SET before us.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10. So for we are his
[2:01:08] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[2:01:11] unto good works,
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; which God hath before ordained that we
[2:01:16] should walk in them.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; We are his workmanship. We are his
[2:01:20] business.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; I think it's time that we set in our
[2:01:25] hearts at the turn of a year that we
[2:01:27] mean business. That we mean business
[2:01:29] with God. That we take God seriously.
[2:01:32] THAT WE TAKE CHURCH SERIOUSLY. THAT WE
[2:01:34] TAKE SERVING GOD AND LIVING AND SERVING
[2:01:36] AND HAVING A CHRISTIAN LIFE.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Mean business with God.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Here he brother Brandham's talking about
[2:01:53] sons coming into sitting under tutors
[2:01:55] and governors until appointed time. He
[2:01:58] says now notice he was potentially
[2:02:00] placed and then he become a full-fledged
[2:02:02] son. then his name was was good. HE SAYS
[2:02:05] THAT'S THE WAY it is the way with the
[2:02:08] church. If we could get away from our
[2:02:10] little indifferences and COME TO CHRIST
[2:02:12] AND FORGET ALL THAT outside world and
[2:02:14] forget about denominations and so forth
[2:02:16] and not only just DENOMINATIONS BUT WHAT
[2:02:19] THIS church is doing IN THE MESSAGE AND
[2:02:20] THAT CHURCH IS DOING IN THE FORGET ALL
[2:02:22] THAT.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Run the race. BE A BUSINESSMAN WITH GOD.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Good advice.
[2:02:31] ALL THESE OUTSIDE THINGS AND SO FORTH.
[2:02:33] BE OBEDIENT, CHILDREN, AND BE ABOUT THE
[2:02:36] FATHER'S BUSINESS TO GET SOUL saved to
[2:02:39] do the things of God. After a while,
[2:02:41] he'll set us aside and will anoint us
[2:02:44] with the Holy Ghost and they will then
[2:02:46] we are positionally placed in his
[2:02:49] kingdom. Some has gifts of wisdom and
[2:02:51] some of knowledge and some gifts of
[2:02:53] tongues and SOME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
[2:02:55] and some prophets AND OTHER GIFTS. YOU
[2:02:57] UNDERSTAND THAT EACH ONE OF YOU, ALL OF
[2:02:59] US HAVE A A PART TO PLAY. YOU DON'T HAVE
[2:03:01] TO PREACH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SING, BUT
[2:03:03] YOU you can be faithful. You can say
[2:03:05] amen to the word.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE ALL DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN THE
[2:03:12] BODY OF CHRIST. THERE'S NO BIG EYES AND
[2:03:13] LITTLE U'S. THERE'S NOT ONE BIT BIGGER
[2:03:16] AND BETTER than the other.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; No, no, no.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Every one of us has got to be about the
[2:03:25] father's business. That's the truth
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. WHEN WAS
[2:03:29] THE LAST TIME THAT YOU YOU WITNESSED TO
[2:03:31] A COWORKER or you shared the gospel WITH
[2:03:33] SOMEBODY OR YOU BEGAN TO SHOW THE LOVE
[2:03:36] OF GOD OR BOUGHT SOMEBODY A MEAL OR DONE
[2:03:38] SOMETHING OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE? I I
[2:03:40] THINK MANY TIMES WE WE'RE TOO
[2:03:41] comfortable in where we're at.
[2:03:49] Five years ago,
[2:03:51] watch night is special TO ME BECAUSE
[2:03:53] FIVE YEARS AGO, our pastor put me in an
[2:03:56] uncomfortable situation.
[2:03:58] And he said, "I want you TO TAKE 20
[2:04:00] MINUTES." WELL, HOW DID THAT 20 MINUTES
[2:04:02] TURN INTO FIVE YEARS?
[2:04:04] And I believe THAT THERE'S MORE GIFTS
[2:04:06] laying dormant in our CHURCH BECAUSE
[2:04:08] YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT EXERCISING. YOU'RE NOT
[2:04:10] GETTING UNCOMFORTABLE. YOU THINK THAT
[2:04:12] YOU'RE JUST SITTING AND COMING TO CHURCH
[2:04:13] AND SERVING GOD AND DOING THOSE THINGS.
[2:04:16] WHAT ABOUT SERVING SOMEBODY ELSE?
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT GIFT DO YOU HAVE? I CHALLENGE YOU
[2:04:20] IN 2026. FIND THE GIFT. IF YOU DON'T
[2:04:23] HAVE A GIFT OR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT
[2:04:24] IS OR WHAT YOUR POSITION IS, FIND IT
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; AND SERVE GOD.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; BE OBEDIENT.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Love God.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; I need you and you need me. We need one
[2:04:36] another.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; It's going to take every bit of us to
[2:04:40] make this. Yes. Amen.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Got to close with this. Ephesians 1
[2:04:49] and6.
[2:04:51] Being confident of this very thing that
[2:04:54] he which have begun a work in you
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; will perform it
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; until the day of Jesus Christ.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Until the day of Jesus Christ. I'm
[2:05:04] confident in one thing.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; The father's business.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:10] that he who has begun a work
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; is going to finish it.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; We love you. We look forward to serving
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; and we trust that you take these
[2:05:20] challenges.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; That you live for one another.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; As a body, as a unit,
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; let us grow. Let us mature. Let's leave
[2:05:30] all those things behind us.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; But let us go into our goal.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; The rapture is just before us. Y
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; that's what this is all about. When God
[2:05:40] finishes his business,
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; when the last seed, let me put it THIS
[2:05:44] WAY, WHEN THE LAST SEED BECOMES ABOUT
[2:05:46] HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS, THE WORK IS
[2:05:48] FINISHED. THE BUSINESS IS FINISHED.
[2:05:50] EVERYTHING'S GONE.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:05:55] [applause]
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother James. Uh Lissa and
[2:06:04] Lydia, if you could come real quick and
[2:06:06] we'll turn the service to brother Ron
[2:06:07] after you sing. And if we didn't get to
[2:06:09] your song special tonight, Lord willing,
[2:06:10] we can have you bless us with a song on
[2:06:12] Sunday. But it's been good to be in the
[2:06:14] house of the Lord tonight. Amen. So the
[2:06:16] girls would come and bless us with a
[2:06:18] song and then we'll turn the service
[2:06:20] right to brother Ron.
[2:07:26] There is a resting place in the center
[2:07:29] [singing] of his grace. I long to be in
[2:07:33] it and so should you. [music]
[2:07:37] So Lord, guide my way in the sleigh to
[2:07:41] [singing] see and they
[2:07:44] I only want to do what you [music] want
[2:07:46] me to. [singing]
[2:07:48] Lord, with every step I take, with every
[2:07:53] [music and singing] move I make, let
[2:07:55] your Holy Spirit be my
[2:07:58] [singing and music] guide.
[2:08:01] Let me always heed your voice when I
[2:08:04] have to [music and singing] make a
[2:08:06] choice. I want your perfect will
[2:08:09] [singing] for my life.
[2:08:21] So many times we [music and singing]
[2:08:22] think we're right. Think we have a green
[2:08:26] light, but find ourselves in God's
[2:08:30] permissive [singing] will.
[2:08:32] But oh, [music] what glory and what
[2:08:35] beauty to be in the line of [singing]
[2:08:38] duty, his perfect will, I always want to
[2:08:42] fill.
[2:08:44] Lord, with every [music] step I take,
[2:08:48] with every move [singing] I make, let
[2:08:50] your Holy Spirit be [music] my guide.
[2:08:56] Let me always [singing] heed your voice
[2:08:59] when I have to make [music] a choice. I
[2:09:02] want your perfect will for my life.
[2:09:07] Then [music] I don't [singing] ever want
[2:09:09] to be caught
[2:09:11] doing God a service without his will.
[2:09:17] [music] Know that he has a plan for me.
[2:09:20] I [singing] know that there are wonders
[2:09:22] to fulfill
[2:09:25] and I [singing] will Lord with every
[2:09:30] step I take with every move [music] I
[2:09:33] make. Let your Holy Spirit be my guide.
[2:09:40] Let me always [music] heed [singing]
[2:09:42] your voice when I have to make a choice.
[2:09:46] I want your perfect will for my life.
[2:09:52] I want your perfect will for my life.
[2:09:55] [singing]
[2:09:58] I want your perfect will for my life.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[2:10:14] [music]
[2:10:16] [applause]
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this evening. I
[2:10:32] greet you in the lovely name of Jesus
[2:10:34] Christ. Amen. Here we are 2025.
[2:10:39] So very rapidly. Where did it go?
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Where did it go? It
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; And the older I am, the faster time
[2:10:50] goes. But you know what? I I I put that
[2:10:53] as a matter of prayer. God, why is it
[2:10:55] going so fast? Why is it going so
[2:11:00] quickly? because you're getting an
[2:11:03] upgrade. Because here you're going to
[2:11:05] step into another dimension. You got
[2:11:08] brother BRENNHAM SAID IT'S JUST FASTER
[2:11:10] THAN THE one you're in right now. That's
[2:11:12] why the older we get,
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; THE FASTER IT GOES.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; I'm already on my journey.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; I'm already getting there.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; How about you?
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:11:33] I told brother Neil Mdd I would greet
[2:11:35] him and say hello to him. He he had a
[2:11:38] procedure today and was unable to come
[2:11:41] and I told him I'd wave to him. How
[2:11:43] about all of you? Why don't you wave
[2:11:44] right now? Yeah. Hey. Hey, brother Neil,
[2:11:46] Sister Karen, God bless you. Greet you
[2:11:48] in the name of the Lord.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; See you Sunday.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh
[2:11:57] yeah. and uh brother Kelly McMillan and
[2:12:01] Sister Cheryl are said they would be
[2:12:05] streaming. So I greet them in the name
[2:12:06] of the Lord also. Sister Nancy Tempe, I
[2:12:10] did not even have to look for you. I
[2:12:13] JUST HEARD YOUR VOICE.

[2:13:43] bless you richly, each and everyone.
[2:13:50] Listen, I'm going to take my liberty. I
[2:13:52] went ahead and had somebody send me a
[2:13:55] song of a or a video of a song
[2:14:01] and it blessed me. Are are you brothers
[2:14:04] ready if I ask you to play that?
[2:14:07] Okay. And can we put it full screen and
[2:14:10] get the the words up there on it? I want
[2:14:12] you to listen to this. Um, sister uh
[2:14:17] Danielle Iverson went ahead and sent
[2:14:19] this to me and I listened to it and it
[2:14:21] really blessed me. Read the words and if
[2:14:23] you brethren to get ready, go ahead and
[2:14:25] and let's turn up the volume so we hear
[2:14:28] it very nicely.
[2:14:46] Do we have the sound?
[2:15:11] Houston, we have a problem.
[2:15:16] Okay, we'll find out if if
[2:15:19] they are unable within
[2:15:22] 30 seconds to get this resolved,
[2:15:26] we will continue
[2:15:28] because we have some unfinished
[2:15:31] business.
[2:15:33] Amen.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; I don't even have my phone.
[2:15:43] Um,
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; yeah. Go get it on my on my desk. It's
[2:15:49] on the
[2:15:52] It's on the bookshelf.
[2:15:54] Ah, there it is. There it is. All right.
[2:15:56] Let's see if
[2:15:59] Let's start again.
[2:16:13] And
[2:16:26] at the [singing] end of this year, I
[2:16:29] pause and breathe.
[2:16:33] Looking back at where you carried me,
[2:16:39] there were [singing] moments of joy and
[2:16:42] tears.
[2:16:46] But your faithful hand was always near.
[2:16:52] Some prayers answered, some still wait.
[2:16:56] Some lessons learned through [singing]
[2:16:57] grace.
[2:16:59] Every step, every season, you are never
[2:17:03] [music and singing] far away.
[2:17:07] At the end of this year, [music] I give
[2:17:11] you thanks
[2:17:14] for every [singing and music] road, for
[2:17:17] every change.
[2:17:21] Through the [music and singing] highs
[2:17:23] and through the pain,
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; you are shaping who I am.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; At the end [music and singing] of this
[2:17:35] year, I still believe.
[2:17:40] You are [music] God [singing] who's
[2:17:42] faithful.
[2:17:47] Yesterday,
[2:17:49] today [singing]
[2:17:51] the same.
[2:17:53] Forever you remain.
[2:18:02] There were [music] doors that [singing]
[2:18:03] did not open. There were dreams I had to
[2:18:07] lay down. Still, I learned to trust you
[2:18:10] deeper. Even [music] when I didn't
[2:18:13] [singing]
[2:18:13] understand. In the silence, in the
[2:18:16] waiting,
[2:18:17] you were working in my heart.
[2:18:21] Every moment [music] held a purpose.
[2:18:23] Nothing ever fell apart. [singing]
[2:18:29] At the end of this year, I give you
[2:18:34] thanks [music]
[2:18:36] for every wrong, for [singing]
[2:18:39] every change. [music]
[2:18:43] the [singing] eyes and through the
[2:18:46] [music] pain.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; You were shaming who I am.
[2:18:55] At the [music and singing] end of this
[2:18:56] year, I still believe
[2:19:02] you are [music and singing] God who's
[2:19:04] faithful endlessly.
[2:19:09] Yesterday, [music]
[2:19:11] today
[2:19:12] the same
[2:19:15] forever you remain.
[2:19:23] I place [music and singing] my future in
[2:19:26] your hands,
[2:19:30] all [music] my [singing] hope, all my
[2:19:32] plans.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Whatever [music and singing] comes, I
[2:19:37] will trust your love is more than
[2:19:40] enough.
[2:19:44] At the [music] end of [singing] this
[2:19:45] year, I choose to stand
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; with a grateful [singing]
[2:19:52] heart and lifted [music]
[2:19:55] hands.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; I step into [singing]
[2:19:59] tomorrow,
[2:20:00] trusting you [music] once more.
[2:20:04] Thank you, Lord.
[2:20:07] Thank [music] you, Lord, [singing]
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; for walking with me through this year.
[2:20:28] Let's stand together
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; at the end of this year.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; I will still believe
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; through all that you've brought me
[2:20:41] through. It's you that helped me.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; It's you that kept me. You did not keep
[2:20:47] yourself. LET ME TELL YOU, IT IS NOT YOU
[2:20:50] THAT KEEP YOURSELF. IT IS GOD THAT KEEPS
[2:20:53] YOU BY THE POWER OF HIS WORD AND THROUGH
[2:20:56] THE PROMISES OF GOD, HE THAT BEGAN THE
[2:20:59] GOOD WORK IN YOU WILL FINISH IT.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen to that?
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's remain
[2:21:13] standing and turn with me in your
[2:21:16] Bibles, please, to Ephesians 1. [snorts]
[2:21:21] Ephesians 4 verse one. Ephesians 4 verse
[2:21:24] one. I don't know. I uh
[2:21:29] I want to be through by 11:15.
[2:21:34] [snorts]
[2:21:35] Excuse me. I get a little excited.
[2:21:44] [snorts]
[2:21:46] Ephesians 4:1.
[2:21:50] I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,
[2:21:54] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[2:21:56] vocation wherewith ye are called,
[2:21:59] [snorts] with all loneliness and
[2:22:01] meekness,
[2:22:02] with longsuffering, forbearing one
[2:22:05] another
[2:22:07] in love,
[2:22:09] endeavoring
[2:22:11] to keep the unity of the spirit
[2:22:14] in the bond of peace. Notice unity of
[2:22:18] the spirit with capital S meaning it's
[2:22:21] got to be God to do it.
[2:22:23] [snorts]
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; There is one body and one spirit even as
[2:22:26] you are called in one hope of your
[2:22:28] calling. One Lord, one faith, one
[2:22:31] baptism, one God and father of all
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; who is above [snorts] all and through
[2:22:36] all and in you all.
[2:22:42] But unto every one of us is given grace
[2:22:45] according to the measure of the gift of
[2:22:48] Christ.
[2:22:49] Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up
[2:22:51] on high, he led captivity captive,
[2:22:56] and he gave gifts unto men.
[2:23:00] Now that he ascended,
[2:23:03] what is it? But that he also descended
[2:23:07] first into the lower parts of the earth.
[2:23:10] He that descended is the same also that
[2:23:13] ascended up far above all the heavens,
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; that he might fill all things.
[2:23:22] [snorts] And he gave some apostles and
[2:23:25] some prophets and some evangelists and
[2:23:29] some PASTORS AND TEACHERS FOR the
[2:23:32] perfecting of the saints, for the work
[2:23:35] of the ministry, for the edifying of the
[2:23:38] body of Christ.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Till we all come into the unity of the
[2:23:42] faith. Notice verse three said unity of
[2:23:45] the spirit in the bond of peace. TILL WE
[2:23:48] ALL COME into the unity of the faith
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; and of the knowledge of the son of God
[2:23:55] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[2:24:01] the stature
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; unto the fullness of Christ.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; That we henceforth be no more children
[2:24:12] tossed to and fro.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[2:24:15] carried about with every wind of
[2:24:16] doctrine by the slight of men and
[2:24:19] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in
[2:24:22] weight to deceive, but speaking the
[2:24:24] truth in love, may grow up into him in
[2:24:27] all things, which is the head, even
[2:24:30] Christ,
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; from whom the whole body fitly joined
[2:24:35] together, and compacted by that which
[2:24:37] every joint supply,
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; according to the effectual working in
[2:24:42] the measure of every part,
[2:24:44] making increase of the body unto the
[2:24:46] edifying of itself
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; in love. [snorts]
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:54] Revelation chapter 22.
[2:24:57] [snorts] Revelation chapter 22.
[2:25:03] Unfinished business.
[2:25:11] And the spirit and the bride
[2:25:13] say come. This verse 17. And let him
[2:25:16] that heareth say come. And let him that
[2:25:19] is a thirst come. And whosoever will let
[2:25:24] him take of the water of life freely.
[2:25:27] For I testify unto every man that
[2:25:29] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[2:25:31] this book. If any man shall add unto
[2:25:34] these things,
[2:25:36] God shall add unto him the plagues that
[2:25:38] are written in this book. And if any man
[2:25:40] shall take away from the words of the of
[2:25:44] the book of this prophecy,
[2:25:47] God shall take away his part out of the
[2:25:49] book of life, and out of the holy city,
[2:25:51] and from the things which are written in
[2:25:54] this book.
[2:25:56] He which testifith these, saying, saith,
[2:26:00] Surely I come quickly, even amen, even
[2:26:04] so, come, Lord Jesus. The grace of our
[2:26:07] Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
[2:26:11] God bless you. You may be seated this
[2:26:13] evening in the presence of the Lord.
[2:26:16] Amen. And I'd like to I I have been
[2:26:19] overcome
[2:26:23] [snorts] in the last
[2:26:25] month
[2:26:28] in
[2:26:30] wanting to understand to the greatest
[2:26:32] emphasis
[2:26:34] about the uniting time and sign.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; I titled this the uniting time and sign
[2:26:42] part three.
[2:26:44] And I want to take a subject for just a
[2:26:47] short moment this evening is the unity
[2:26:51] of the faith. Now there's one THING THAT
[2:26:54] THE DEVIL DOES NOT like and that's for
[2:26:57] the bride to dwell in unity.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Because it is his business to divide
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; and conquer.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT DIVIDED. LET ME TELL YOU, WE
[2:27:13] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST ARE NOT A
[2:27:16] DIVIDED PEOPLE. WE ARE UNITED WITH
[2:27:18] CHRIST THE word and he is our headship.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Now, yes, we have little divisions and
[2:27:29] little schisms between us. And I say the
[2:27:33] closer we get.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; THE CLOSER WE GET TO GOD, THE LESS THOSE
[2:27:40] THINGS WILL MATTER. WHETHER HE COMES ON
[2:27:42] A WHITE HORSE OR WHETHER HE COMES ON A
[2:27:45] WHITE CLOUD, IT DOESN'T MATTER. AS LONG
[2:27:48] AS WE AGREE THAT HE'S COMING.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "HE'S COMING."
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; I HAVE SEEN. HOW DO I KNOW? BECAUSE A
[2:27:56] PROPHET IS A SIGN.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Listen to me.
[2:28:01] THE WORLD DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THIS END
[2:28:05] time sign.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; But he said predestinated.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; He said if you're PREDESTINATED
[2:28:12] FROM THE VERY MIND OF GOD,
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT WHEN GOD FULFILLS HIS WORD,
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; do you understand? EVEN AS SISTER
[2:28:24] PERFECT SAID, YOU'RE THE EVIDENCE.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:28:28] DO
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; YOU REALIZE YOU ARE SITTING HERE TONIGHT
[2:28:31] AS EVIDENCE THAT GOD SENT A MESSAGE?
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, WHY ARE YOU HERE?
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; If you're not here to manifest
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; GOD'S INTERPRETATION, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
[2:28:47] ARE? YOU ARE THE MESSAGE.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE VERY INTERPRETATION.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT?
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:58] LUTHER'S
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE THAT FOLLOWED HIS MESSAGE
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY CAME AND THEY RECEIVED WHAT
[2:29:05] GOD GAVE TO LUTHER AND THE JUST SHALL
[2:29:08] LIVE BY FAITH.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THAT GOD WAS INTERPRETING
[2:29:14] HIS WORD?
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; THEY BECAME THE JUST.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE INTERPRETATION. AMEN.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY TIME GOD
[2:29:28] SENDS A PROPHET,
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; WHEN THOSE AGREE AND PROSPER,
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT PROSPERING TO COME UNDER
[2:29:38] that anointing?
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Praise God.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Get Yeah.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Let's get with it.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; I mean business.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:54] I believe that.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; How many of you say, "I mean business."
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not in this thing for second place.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; If you're GOING TO RUN,
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; RUN TO GAIN [screaming] THE PRIZE. IF
[2:30:10] YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT, FIGHT TO WIN.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, DON'T even get in the game.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; But if you're going to get in the game,
[2:30:18] get serious.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. IT'S ABOUT TIME
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; THAT WE PUT ALL OF THESE SINS THAT SO
[2:30:27] EASILY BESET YOU.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; THESE THINGS THAT WERE THINGS THAT YOU
[2:30:32] PUT PREEMINENCE ON
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU PUT IMPORTANCE ON.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS A BUSINESS.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRENHAM SAID THAT WHEN JESUS
[2:30:41] CHRIST WAS HERE, LISTEN TO ME AND LISTEN
[2:30:44] VERY CAREFULLY.
[2:30:46] HE SAID THAT WHEN JESUS CHRIST WAS HERE,
[2:30:49] HE DID NOT FINISH THE WORK.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; HE LEFT A PEOPLE
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD COME UNDER THAT ANOINTING.
[2:31:00] THEY WOULD FINISH IT.
[2:31:05] COME ON.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; They would
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; they
[2:31:17] would FINISH
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT THE PROPHETS PROPHESY.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; what are YOU DOING WITH THIS MESSAGE?
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Are you even listening?
[2:31:34] BECAUSE GOD HAS GIVEN YOU A
[2:31:36] RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH
[2:31:38] IT?
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; WHY TOY AROUND WITH IT?
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; Either get IN OR GET OUT.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; I must be
[2:31:54] about my father's business.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; What is his business? fulfilling
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; his word.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Fulfilling
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; his word.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:09] You and I, my brother, my sister, have
[2:32:11] got a a great
[2:32:14] responsibility
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAS SENT YOU A PROPHET with
[2:32:21] a message.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; And you HAD THE ABILITY TO HEAR.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. THIS EVENING I
[2:32:29] BEAR EVERY ONE of you RECORD
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE
[2:32:34] YOU'VE HEARD THAT PROPHET THEN I ASK YOU
[2:32:36] WHY ARE YOU SITTING HERE?
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; Good question.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Go play your sports. GO DO YOUR GAMES.
[2:32:46] GO DO THOSE THINGS. BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT
[2:32:49] AN EAR TO HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT IS
[2:32:52] SAYING,
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; your ear hears WHAT THE SPIRIT IS
[2:32:57] SAYING. AND WHEN YOU JOIN YOUR
[2:32:59] [screaming] VOICE
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; WITH THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT, THE SPIRIT
[2:33:04] AND THE BRIDE
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; ARE SAYING THE SAME THING.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE to
[2:33:10] reiterate. YOU'RE NOT SOME KIND OF
[2:33:12] PARROT.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER. AMEN.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; You're living voices.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE the [screaming] evidence.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE EVIDENCE OF MALACHI 4.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE EVIDENCE OF REVELATIONS 10:7.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE EVIDENCE. WHY? BECAUSE 108
[2:33:37] TAKES THE BOOK.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You are what you eat.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:52] [snorts]
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; I'm quivering.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; I'm quivering inside
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; because I think that sometimes
[2:34:03] I cannot PREACH IT GOOD ENOUGH
[2:34:06] to get you to understand.
[2:34:15] I mean business.
[2:34:17] [snorts]
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; God help me
[2:34:28] to stir up your pure pure minds
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; to put you in remembrance.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT MY MESSAGE.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; NEITHER WAS IT WILLIAM Brandham's
[2:34:39] message.
[2:34:41] Amen.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "I have no more to do with this
[2:34:46] message than a voice."
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Against my own better
[2:34:50] judgment."
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I wanted to go be a trapper."
[2:34:57] But God
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; God made it so serious for him
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; that because when he listened to his
[2:35:08] mother-in-law
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; AND HE FOLLOWED HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW'S
[2:35:13] ADVICE, HE LOST HIS WIFE AND HIS LITTLE
[2:35:16] BABY. HE SAID, "I I COULD UNDERSTAND.
[2:35:20] I MIGHT COULD UNDERSTAND. DID YOU TAKE
[2:35:22] MY WIFE
[2:35:24] BUT NOT MY Sharon Rose?
[2:35:29] Do you know why he did it?
[2:35:32] To make him bear the gravity that there
[2:35:36] was a bride that had to be preached to
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; and he HAD TO TAKE SERIOUS THIS MESSY.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; ANGELS SENT TO HIM, coming to him,
[2:35:46] giving him THE WORD OF THE LORD. And
[2:35:48] then you guys
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; just sit THERE AND JUST TRY TO ABSORB.
[2:35:55] I SAY GET INTO IT.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; If you're NOT LISTENING TO THE MESSAGE,
[2:36:00] IT'S PROBABLY NOT FOR YOU.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; YEAH. I'm not going to baby you and
[2:36:08] pamper you and tantalize you AND TELL
[2:36:11] YOU EVERYBODY'S GOING. NOT EVERYBODY'S
[2:36:13] GOING. THERE'S ONLY GOING TO BE A
[2:36:15] PREDESTINATED
[2:36:17] ELECT SEED.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SALVATION. LOT WAS
[2:36:22] [screaming] SAVED, BUT HE WASN'T SEALED.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I DON'T WANT JUST
[2:36:28] SALVATION.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO TO THE NEW JERUSALEM.
[2:36:32] THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME THAT'S
[2:36:35] SAYING THAT'S MY [screaming] HOME.
[2:36:43] I WANT MY INHERENT.
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; I don't want just salvation.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Many are called
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; but few
[2:37:02] are chosen.
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, are you chosen?
[2:37:08] Or are you just one of the many?
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; Sure. Well, I'm not so sure. Well, I'm
[2:37:20] not so sure about you. I
[2:37:23] I'm not going to sit here and
[2:37:26] baby you and pamper you and tell you
[2:37:28] everybody's going. No,
[2:37:32] not everybody's gone.
[2:37:36] Only those
[2:37:38] who are about the father's business.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; How serious are you about this?
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; Do you even get into it?
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Do you read it?
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; Do you pray about it?
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever have a secondhand
[2:37:56] revelation? Don't you take mine.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz mine won't HELP YOU.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; UPON THIS ROCK.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU GOT TO HAVE IT FROM THE
[2:38:08] FATHER.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; GOD, [screaming] COME DOWN AND TALK TO
[2:38:12] EVERY ELECTED
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; AND SPEAK TO THEM AND QUICKEN THEM.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; GET OUT OF YOUR LETHARGY AND you and the
[2:38:22] LUKEWARMNESS AND LOUD SEE YOU AND GET ON
[2:38:25] FIRE. AMEN.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; BURN. BURN. HOLY SPIRIT. BURN IN ME.
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs]
[2:38:42] We are the interpretation
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; of this message.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:38:49] [snorts]
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Many of THE PEOPLE YOU RUB SHOULDERS
[2:38:52] WITH MAY NEVER HEAR THAT PROPHET'S
[2:38:55] VOICE.
[2:38:56] MANY OF YOU, YOUR COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS
[2:39:01] MAY NEVER READ A BOOK,
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; BUT YET THEY HEAR
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; THAT PROPHET'S MESSAGE THROUGH YOU,
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; THROUGH YOUR LIFE,
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; THEY MAY NEVER READ THE SEALS. THEY MAY
[2:39:15] NOT KNOW WHAT THE WHITE HORSE RIDER
[2:39:17] MEANS,
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE EVIDENCE.
[2:39:24] IT'S YOU THE INTERPRETATION.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; When you see me,
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; you see the message.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; And if you don't,
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; then I'm a false reflection.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[2:39:52] I don't want to be some false reflection
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; of some kind of a glare of another day.
[2:39:58] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; let me HAVE
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT REFLECTION
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; OF THIS PROPHET
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; AND THE LIFE THAT HE HAD.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST UNDERSTANDING THE
[2:40:12] DOCTRINES.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; It's having his life.
[2:40:19] those men that came to correct him and
[2:40:20] told him he was wrong and they were
[2:40:22] going to pray for him.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't GET SOME ARROGANT SPIRIT.
[2:40:28] DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I'M THE ELIJAH OF
[2:40:30] this day? DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT
[2:40:33] [screaming] I'M GOD'S ANOINTED PROPHET?
[2:40:36] He humbled himself.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "YOU MEAN TO TELL ME GOD SENT
[2:40:40] YOU TO PRAY FOR ME?
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; YES. THAT GOD WOULD GIVE YOU GREATER
[2:40:44] revelation than would you please pray?
[2:40:49] The amazing thing is God answered
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; their prayers.
[2:41:00] [snorts]
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; What are you doing with this message?
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; 2026
[2:41:12] is just
[2:41:14] a few heartbeats away. What are we doing
[2:41:17] with it? I I want you to understand
[2:41:22] and I'm going to declare I've never said
[2:41:24] this from the pulpit.
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; We're changing
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; we're changing dimensions
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; because when you eat THE BOOK,
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; THE FIRST THING THE SPIRIT SAID, "COME
[2:41:42] UP HIGHER, JOHN."
[2:41:45] I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, CHURCH, WHEN
[2:41:47] YOU EAT THIS REVEALED WORD, GOD IS
[2:41:50] REQUIRING YOU OF A HIGHER DIMENSION,
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; BEYOND CHURCH ORDER.
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; BEYOND A LONG DRESS AND LONG HAIR,
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; BEYOND HIGH HEELS.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS A LIFE.
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; OH, I wish I could preach.
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; I wish I had an ability.
[2:42:22] I wish I could paint TO YOU
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD HAS DONE AT THIS HOUR.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; I'm being
[2:42:33] consumed.
[2:42:37] I'm being overcome.
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to declare unto you.
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; We're changing
[2:42:51] not only
[2:42:52] dispensation,
[2:42:55] brother Brennan, because he says we are
[2:42:57] changing dispensation. Do you see this
[2:42:59] anti-semitism coming up?
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; Do you see the coming against the Jews?
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; Yep. Brother Brennham said in the second
[2:43:07] world war he said Hitler, Stalin and Mus
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; he said our pre-tribulation
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; spirits
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; you watch this spirit
[2:43:24] he says it'll rise he says America
[2:43:27] Revelation chapter 13
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; it starts like a lamb
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; two ecclesiastical
[2:43:35] horns.
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; It's got nappy hair.
[2:43:43] He said like the American buffalo.
[2:43:47] He says, "But her destiny." Listen to
[2:43:49] me. You want to know why we have people
[2:43:53] that are in offices today who are
[2:43:57] swearing in under the Quran instead of
[2:44:00] the Bible? Do you know why we have ones
[2:44:03] who hate America? I SAY TO ALL OF THESE
[2:44:07] THAT HATE AMERICA, that want to see HER
[2:44:09] DOWN, I SAY, GO BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE
[2:44:12] BORN. GO BACK TO WHERE YOU BELONG.
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; But even if you sent them,
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; it's too late.
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FRAUD
[2:44:28] BY OUR CORRUPTED POLITICIANS
[2:44:32] IT'S TOO LATE.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; She's going down.
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't pray for America
[2:44:42] anymore."
[2:44:43] Says 1956, she rejected the gospel.
[2:44:47] Listen to me, young people.
[2:44:49] Trump,
[2:44:51] okay?
[2:44:53] He's not a politician. He's a
[2:44:55] businessman.
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; You think it's going to get better? I'm
[2:44:59] going to tell you it ain't
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; because every time they find this
[2:45:03] billions of dollars of fraud, there's a
[2:45:05] couple more holes over here that they
[2:45:07] haven't even uncovered.
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; It's too late.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; So, don't you put your your faith in
[2:45:15] this system. Don't you put your faith in
[2:45:19] America. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. IT'LL
[2:45:23] NEVER HAPPEN. IT IS WRITTEN ON THE
[2:45:26] WALLS. AMEN.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; IT'S THUS SAYAITH [screaming] THE LORD.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; Judgement
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; is at our doors.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; Some of you have been playing around.
[2:45:42] Musicians, if you'll come here, [snorts]
[2:45:49] I haven't even begun.
[2:45:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:45:56] Thank you.
[2:45:57] I will.
[2:46:01] You know, Brother Bram says, "I never
[2:46:03] really finish my sermon."
[2:46:07] He says, "I let the people just go home
[2:46:10] and rest.
[2:46:16] This is a never
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; ending
[2:46:21] story.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest story that's ever
[2:46:26] been told
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; and it's so great and it's so marvelous.
[2:46:32] It's never even entered into the mind of
[2:46:35] man.
[2:46:37] No thought could make it
[2:46:40] so grand.
[2:46:42] Let me tell you, don't you miss it? You
[2:46:43] young people, you older ones alike. Let
[2:46:48] let me beg you if I could. Let me beg
[2:46:51] you. Don't miss it.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:57] What price would you put ON THE GOSPEL?
[2:47:00] [snorts] WHAT PRICE WOULD YOU SELL him
[2:47:02] out
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; for a few pieces of silver
[2:47:08] FOR SOME KIND OF CAREER IN THIS LIFE,
[2:47:12] A LITTLE BIT OF EASE?
[2:47:17] I beg you, if you haven't made that
[2:47:20] decision, make it right now.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:47:23] NOT A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION BECAUSE IT'S
[2:47:26] NOT RESOLUTION. You make a resolution
[2:47:28] next week, you break it.
[2:47:38] If I could, if I could,
[2:47:43] if I could quicken you,
[2:47:47] if I could MAKE IT SO REAL THAT the fear
[2:47:50] of God would strike some of you cuz you
[2:47:54] know you've been playing with it.
[2:47:59] And I say you got an opportunity right
[2:48:01] now.
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW TO SAY THE BUCK STOPS HERE.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; I MUST be
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; about my father's history.
[2:48:32] Something's happening
[2:48:34] even right now. My right eye is
[2:48:38] it's blind.
[2:48:41] I can't see out of it.
[2:48:47] Maybe I'm just too serious.
[2:49:19] Brother Billy.
[2:49:20] You could have stayed home tonight.
[2:49:23] Your mama made you a big old meal for
[2:49:25] your brothers. You guys, you could have
[2:49:27] stayed home
[2:49:30] and it would have been all right.
[2:49:34] It would have been nice,
[2:49:40] but something compelled you. You said,
[2:49:41] "Brother Ron, I've got to come."
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; I said, "You chose the better part.
[2:49:49] Amen.
[2:49:53] &gt;&gt; You did. You chose the better part
[2:49:55] because right now, you know what God's
[2:49:57] doing? He's causing some of you right
[2:49:59] now in your seat where you're at under
[2:50:02] the under the the presence of God right
[2:50:06] now. You know, you have not really
[2:50:10] gotten real serious
[2:50:12] with this. And God is giving you a time
[2:50:14] right now. Yes.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; I don't need you to bow your head and
[2:50:19] close your eyes. Them days are over.
[2:50:23] &gt;&gt; Them days of trying to coax and [music]
[2:50:25] and and comp.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; It's time for you to take a stand.
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HAVE DONE ALL TO [screaming]
[2:50:38] STAND.
[2:50:40] &gt;&gt; STAND.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; Didn't say sit down. didn't say lay
[2:50:44] down.
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; It said stand.
[2:50:48] [snorts]
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; I make a declaration in front of all of
[2:50:53] you.
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; I will stand.
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; If nobody else stands,
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; this is my day
[2:51:04] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS MY HOUR.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND I WILL NOT SHUCK
[2:51:11] OR SHERK MY RESPONSIBILITY.
[2:51:17] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRENNHAM SAID, "IF I GET THAT
[2:51:18] BRIDE TO STAND STILL LONG ENOUGH,
[2:51:27] &gt;&gt; you know what he said, Paul?
[2:51:30] I'll dress her with the word."
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is stand still long
[2:51:34] enough.
[2:51:41] I read to you that quote where brother
[2:51:43] Bram says, "God
[2:51:45] created himself
[2:51:49] &gt;&gt; his own bride."
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; She's a mail order bride.
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; You know what? Don't tell nobody. It's a
[2:51:57] great secret.
[2:52:00] &gt;&gt; She's the mystery
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; of the mystery.
[2:52:06] But she's about to be unveiled
[2:52:10] &gt;&gt; cuz God's unveiling her. How's he doing
[2:52:12] it? By his word.
[2:52:19] &gt;&gt; You think it's you.
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; It's got nothing to do with you.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Has to do
[2:52:27] Bo has to do with the seed that lays
[2:52:30] inside there. He said, "I predestinated
[2:52:33] you. I ordained you.
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; I called you before their world was even
[2:52:41] &gt;&gt; I CALLED YOU. I PLACE ON YOUR FINGER
[2:52:45] UNMMERITED [screaming] FAVOR. AND THAT'S
[2:52:48] WHY WHEN I SENT A VOICE,
[2:52:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:52:50] &gt;&gt; YOU HAD AN EAR TO HEAR. [screaming]
[2:52:52] THAT'S WHY YOU BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE.
[2:52:56] &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE
[2:52:59] YOU ARE THE MESSAGE.
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN.
[2:53:03] Thank you, Lord.
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; I am the voice.
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; say, "Come."
[2:53:23] &gt;&gt; I say unto you, come.
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; I say unto you that have never
[2:53:32] said yes.
[2:53:34] Say it now.
[2:53:39] &gt;&gt; Quit playing.
[2:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:42] &gt;&gt; I don't need you to come to an altar.
[2:53:44] The altar's in your heart.
[2:53:53] &gt;&gt; Just say yes.
[2:54:02] That's all. The angel
[2:54:06] that came to Mary,
[2:54:09] [snorts]
[2:54:11] he could not leave Mary
[2:54:16] until the business was finished.
[2:54:18] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:54:21] until
[2:54:24] all these salutations and angels and
[2:54:27] blessed art thou Mary
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; among all women.
[2:54:34] [sighs]
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; She pondered these things in her mind.
[2:54:38] How can this be?
[2:54:40] &gt;&gt; How can it be? AND WHO AM I
[2:54:44] &gt;&gt; THAT I WOULD HAVE THE CHRIST CHILD?
[2:54:47] I WANT TO ASK YOU, WHAT KIND OF PERSON
[2:54:49] ARE YOU?
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; GOOD QUESTION.
[2:54:52] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU?
[2:54:54] &gt;&gt; I WILL TELL YOU, JUST AS MARY WAS A
[2:54:58] RECIPIENT OF A WORD FROM AN ANGEL,
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN ORDAINED [screaming] TO
[2:55:04] RECEIVE
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE.
[2:55:10] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S TRANSFORMING YOU.
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:55:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:55:19] YEAH.
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; Hurry up.
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; He sent his angels.
[2:55:40] He sent vindications
[2:55:43] and signs.
[2:55:48] And then he sent apostles, some of them,
[2:55:55] some evangelists,
[2:55:58] some pastors.
[2:56:00] For
[2:56:02] understand this, that no man takes this
[2:56:04] glory [music] to himself. If I've ever
[2:56:07] preached a sermon, if any one of these
[2:56:10] brethren here or anyone that stood
[2:56:13] behind this pulpit has ever preached a
[2:56:16] sermon that quickened your soul,
[2:56:21] it wasn't the man.
[2:56:27] &gt;&gt; It was God using the gift.
[2:56:35] I can't help nobody.
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; But if I can get myself out of the way,
[2:56:43] &gt;&gt; and I let him live through me.
[2:56:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe God was speaking to you tonight
[2:56:50] through a gift.
[2:56:52] &gt;&gt; You said it wasn't Brother Ron. It was
[2:56:53] the gift. If you look beyond the veil
[2:56:59] many times, brother Brenham said,
[2:57:04] he says because the way God ve himself,
[2:57:08] he says many people miss it
[2:57:12] because God changes his mask.
[2:57:17] You understand? You know what God's
[2:57:20] doing?
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; God's becoming immorph.
[2:57:29] in flesh.
[2:57:36] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[2:57:39] This mystery
[2:57:41] that's been hid down through the ages.
[2:57:47] Do you know what this mystery is? Let me
[2:57:50] tell you.
[2:57:52] Don't never forget it. It's Christ
[2:57:56] &gt;&gt; in you, Frederick.
[2:57:58] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you,
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. Benjamin,
[2:58:04] son of the right hand.
[2:58:08] &gt;&gt; You know why you believe this message?
[2:58:11] Because you was ordained.
[2:58:20] Sister Marty,
[2:58:22] you was ordained.
[2:58:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I sit [music] there no matter
[2:58:28] how hard I preach it, Sister Marty. Yes.
[2:58:31] Yes. Yes. Yes.
[2:58:34] Amen.
[2:58:40] &gt;&gt; Rebecca, my daughter,
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; you was ordained
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; to hear this message.
[2:58:47] called before the foundation of the
[2:58:49] world.
[2:59:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brighton,
[2:59:04] who was it that called you,
[2:59:07] that made you believe what you believe?
[2:59:13] Brother Johnny.
[2:59:17] Why?
[2:59:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MANY HAVE LOST THEIR WAY AND
[2:59:24] THEY'VE LEFT AND THEY'VE GONE HERE AND
[2:59:25] THERE AND HIT THE DITCH. BROTHER ANDY,
[2:59:28] DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU
[2:59:29] BELIEVE?
[2:59:43] I'm I'm done.
[2:59:51] I wish I could just grab arms with all
[2:59:53] of you and just say, "Okay, let's let
[2:59:56] let's go together."
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[2:59:59] &gt;&gt; Let's let's let's just go together.
[3:00:04] How many of you say
[3:00:05] &gt;&gt; do it? Come, let's do it.
[3:00:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[3:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:21] &gt;&gt; This is
[3:00:24] the brothers asked me tonight, did you
[3:00:26] send me your notes? I said, no.
[3:00:29] I said, I don't even know how far I'll
[3:00:31] get into my message.
[3:00:35] Brother Stephen, I told you, you said,
[3:00:37] "Brother Ron, you going to have all the
[3:00:38] brothers?" I said, "No,
[3:00:42] that's okay. You preached last Sunday."
[3:00:43] It's okay. And that what you were going
[3:00:45] to preach tonight, save it for [music]
[3:00:47] next service.
[3:01:01] Listen,
[3:01:03] the dispensation of Revelations 10:7
[3:01:10] has come and gone
[3:01:13] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[3:01:15] angel when he should begin to sound. Has
[3:01:18] he sounded?
[3:01:19] &gt;&gt; Has he brought forth his message?
[3:01:22] &gt;&gt; But now there's another voice.
[3:01:26] &gt;&gt; It's the same voice.
[3:01:30] It's in another vessel.
[3:01:33] &gt;&gt; It went from one
[3:01:36] to a many members.
[3:01:39] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[3:01:40] &gt;&gt; It's called the mystical body.
[3:01:44] That's what you are,
[3:01:47] &gt;&gt; Vincent.
[3:01:48] That's what you are.
[3:01:52] &gt;&gt; You think Amos just visited with [music]
[3:01:54] you and talked to you and everything.
[3:01:55] What brings you keep coming back?
[3:02:05] Why do you keep coming?
[3:02:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:02:17] &gt;&gt; What's the name of this song?
[3:02:20] &gt;&gt; My hope is in the Lord. Just for a
[3:02:22] moment this evening. Just for a moment.
[3:02:28] Let's worship him.
[3:02:31] My [singing] hope
[3:02:34] is in [music] the Lord.
[3:02:38] [singing]
[3:02:39] From this time [music] on
[3:02:44] and ever more. [singing]
[3:02:48] Oh
[3:02:49] my hope [music]
[3:02:53] is in [singing] the Lord
[3:02:56] [music]
[3:02:58] forever
[3:02:59] more. [singing]
[3:03:03] My hope
[3:03:07] is in the Lord [singing]
[3:03:11] from this time on
[3:03:14] [singing]
[3:03:16] and ever more.
[3:03:19] Oh [music and singing]
[3:03:21] my hope
[3:03:25] is in the Lord [singing]
[3:03:29] forever
[3:03:31] more.
[3:03:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:03:42] &gt;&gt; Somebody come up and touch me. I was
[3:03:45] Don't do that
[3:03:48] because I'm I'm a bit overcome right
[3:03:50] now.
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; I'm overcome.
[3:03:58] [snorts]
[3:04:00] I'm in his presence.
[3:04:04] &gt;&gt; And I trust I trust somebody here,
[3:04:07] somebody here [music] tonight
[3:04:10] that you've never meant business.
[3:04:13] You say, "Tonight's my night.
[3:04:16] &gt;&gt; This is my day.
[3:04:20] &gt;&gt; This is my time. I drive the stake. I
[3:04:23] put the pillar down. I [music] said,
[3:04:27] "This is my day.
[3:04:30] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of running.
[3:04:32] &gt;&gt; And if I'm going to run, I want to run
[3:04:34] to gain the prize."
[3:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord.
[3:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:43] Amen.
[3:04:50] Amen.
[3:04:52] Would you come here and find first
[3:04:55] Corinthians
[3:04:57] 11?
[3:04:59] Come here.
[3:05:05] Let me see. Let me see.
[3:05:08] Here it is. Here it is. Thank you.
[3:05:14] Would you hold me up?
[3:05:24] Thank you.
[3:05:27] [snorts] 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[3:05:31] I want to ask you
[3:05:33] the prophet
[3:05:36] the last several sermons he preaches.
[3:05:42] &gt;&gt; Why do you think he preaches
[3:05:46] about the rapture?
[3:05:51] what house you will build.
[3:05:57] &gt;&gt; And for several sermons in a row,
[3:06:00] he just keeps building. And he keeps
[3:06:02] building
[3:06:04] &gt;&gt; and he he preaches the last what's the
[3:06:06] last sermon he preaches?
[3:06:08] &gt;&gt; Communion.
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; What does communion mean?
[3:06:13] &gt;&gt; It comes from the word communication.
[3:06:20] what God is doing right now with the
[3:06:22] bride.
[3:06:25] &gt;&gt; He's communicating
[3:06:28] &gt;&gt; for faith cometh by hearing
[3:06:32] &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God. You want
[3:06:34] more
[3:06:36] &gt;&gt; faith
[3:06:38] &gt;&gt; increase your hearing.
[3:06:40] Let this be the year
[3:06:42] &gt;&gt; that you increase your hearing
[3:06:44] &gt;&gt; and you increase your reading.
[3:06:49] &gt;&gt; Just just just hold me.
[3:06:54] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 11:23. For I have received
[3:06:56] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[3:06:59] unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same
[3:07:01] night in which he was betrayed took
[3:07:03] bread.
[3:07:06] And when he had given thanks,
[3:07:08] he broke it. What did he do on the road
[3:07:11] to Emmas?
[3:07:14] He broke bread. What was the bread he
[3:07:17] was breaking? He said, "I am the bread
[3:07:19] &gt;&gt; which came down from heaven. Your
[3:07:21] fathers ate mana in the wilderness under
[3:07:24] everyone dead.
[3:07:26] He said, "I am the bread." And when he
[3:07:29] took the bread, he break it.
[3:07:32] What was he breaking? The word, the
[3:07:36] mystery.
[3:07:41] [snorts]
[3:07:42] And when he had given thanks, he break
[3:07:44] it,
[3:07:45] take, eat.
[3:07:49] This is my body which is broken for you.
[3:07:52] This do in remembrance of me,
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; brother Mario. Remember me.
[3:08:06] &gt;&gt; That thief
[3:08:09] on the cross,
[3:08:11] he said we deserve what we're getting,
[3:08:14] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't. How dare you revile
[3:08:16] against him? And he just turned to Jesus
[3:08:19] and he said,
[3:08:22] "Would you remember me
[3:08:25] when you come into your kingdom?"
[3:08:30] &gt;&gt; Never heard a sermon,
[3:08:35] never lived a day for God.
[3:08:39] Would you remember me?
[3:08:43] He says, "I tell you,
[3:08:46] &gt;&gt; says this day you'll be with me."
[3:08:52] &gt;&gt; How did he get there? He wasn't
[3:08:54] baptized.
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; All he did was said, "Remember me." And
[3:09:03] I say this, these magical words to
[3:09:07] someone here tonight, say, "Remember me.
[3:09:12] Would you raise your hand if you say
[3:09:14] remember me tonight?
[3:09:15] &gt;&gt; That's it. Remember me.
[3:09:19] Just remember me.
[3:09:22] Excuse me. Excuse me. And after the same
[3:09:26] manner also he took the cup.
[3:09:30] [snorts]
[3:09:30] And when he had sbed,
[3:09:34] saying, "This cup is the new TESTAMENT
[3:09:37] IN MY BLOOD.
[3:09:40] THIS DO YE as often as you drink it in
[3:09:43] remembrance of me. [snorts] For as often
[3:09:45] as you eat this bread and drink this
[3:09:47] cup, YOU DO SHOW THE LORD'S death till
[3:09:49] he come.
[3:09:52] Wherefore, whosoever
[3:09:54] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[3:09:56] of the Lord unworthily
[3:10:00] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[3:10:02] the Lord. But let a man examine himself,
[3:10:07] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[3:10:10] of that cup. For he that eateth and
[3:10:13] drinkkeeth unworthily
[3:10:15] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[3:10:17] himself, not discerning
[3:10:20] [snorts] the Lord's body.
[3:10:22] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[3:10:26] among you, and many sleep.
[3:10:29] For if we would judge ourselves,
[3:10:35] &gt;&gt; judge yourself right now.
[3:10:39] &gt;&gt; If we would judge ourselves,
[3:10:43] &gt;&gt; we should not be judged.
[3:10:45] But when we are judged,
[3:10:48] [snorts] we are chasened of the Lord.
[3:10:54] Any son that is without chastisement is
[3:10:57] not his son.
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[3:11:00] He's based.
[3:11:04] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, that's rough language.
[3:11:07] He's not begotten of the father.
[3:11:11] He will not receive correction.
[3:11:14] He will not listen to his father.
[3:11:20] [snorts]
[3:11:21] When you're chasen of the Lord, we
[3:11:24] should not be condemned with the world.
[3:11:26] Wherefore my brethren, when you come
[3:11:27] together to eat ty one for another, and
[3:11:31] if any man hunger, let him eat at home,
[3:11:34] that you come not together unto
[3:11:36] condemnation. The rest will I set in
[3:11:38] order when I come. Brother [snorts]
[3:11:41] Brennan made reference to that
[3:11:43] scripture, the rest will I set in order
[3:11:46] when I come. He said, that's why
[3:11:49] God sent me here,
[3:11:52] to set the church in order.
[3:11:55] The rest will I set in order.
[3:12:02] God bless you, brethren.
[3:12:04] Faithful men,
[3:12:07] we can bring it up here.
[3:12:10] I'll be all right.
[3:12:12] I have the pulpit to lean against.
[3:12:16] I'm going to come down here. That's
[3:12:17] okay, Amos. I think I'm okay. I'm okay.
[3:12:21] I just got a little excited.
[3:12:24] How many of you believe that this gospel
[3:12:25] is worth getting excited about?
[3:12:32] &gt;&gt; I used to go to ball games. When I go to
[3:12:34] a ball game, I GOT INTO IT. YEAH. HIT
[3:12:36] IT.
[3:12:39] BACK TO THE WALL. YOU CAN TOUCH IT ALL.
[3:12:43] YEAH.
[3:12:46] But when I became a man,
[3:12:55] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[3:13:05] &gt;&gt; You brethren know that while I break
[3:13:07] this bread,
[3:13:09] Father God,
[3:13:12] in the name of Jesus Christ, I break
[3:13:14] this bread.
[3:13:16] You said, "Take, eat.
[3:13:18] This is my body.
[3:13:23] Father, the body you broke in this hour
[3:13:27] was the veil
[3:13:29] of the body of Christ.
[3:13:32] And you unveiled
[3:13:35] the mystery of God.
[3:13:38] And you said, "If you've seen me,
[3:13:42] you have seen the father."
[3:13:45] &gt;&gt; We've seen the unveiling of God in this
[3:13:47] day.
[3:13:49] Melazdc
[3:13:51] &gt;&gt; came down.
[3:13:54] Who is this Melzdc?
[3:13:56] Who is this? What? What is this
[3:13:59] attraction on the mountain in the
[3:14:01] Coronado Forest of Arizona? Why
[3:14:05] Sunset [snorts] Mountain?
[3:14:08] Because it was evening time.
[3:14:12] Father,
[3:14:14] bless this bread and those that partake
[3:14:15] of it. I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[3:14:18] Amen.
[3:14:27] &gt;&gt; No, just leave it there all. Father God,
[3:14:32] I lay my hands upon these canisters that
[3:14:35] hold within it a cup.
[3:14:40] You said, "Drink of this cup."
[3:14:44] This cup is the New Testament in my
[3:14:46] blood.
[3:14:49] this do as often as you remember me.
[3:14:54] Father, I pray bless this wine.
[3:15:00] May there be a greater wine
[3:15:03] &gt;&gt; that will bless this wine.
[3:15:06] &gt;&gt; And grant to everyone
[3:15:08] &gt;&gt; the stimulating power
[3:15:11] &gt;&gt; of the quickening of the revealed word.
[3:15:15] and may they become the word in flesh.
[3:15:20] &gt;&gt; May they be about their father's
[3:15:22] business.
[3:15:23] &gt;&gt; I pray in Jesus Christ name. Amen.
[3:15:26] [snorts]
[3:15:27] All right. All right. You can be seated
[3:15:31] until they dismiss you row by row. And
[3:15:33] then if you would if you'd come,
[3:15:42] please let's not t go ahead and let's
[3:15:45] come quickly
[3:15:46] because we have a short time
[3:15:50] until 12:00.
[3:15:55] That's it.
[3:15:59] Bless each one, Father that comes this
[3:16:03] evening.
[3:16:06] These young men, these young women,
[3:16:11] predestinated,
[3:16:13] ordained.
[3:16:16] So let them eat of that bread and drink
[3:16:19] of that.
[3:16:22] come
[3:16:23] that whosoever will
[3:16:26] let him come.
[3:16:33] That's it.
[3:16:35] That's it.
[3:16:41] Lord,
[3:16:43] thank you.
[3:16:46] Bless these that come.
[3:17:10] You have a need.
[3:17:14] Bring that need to
[3:17:17] ask.
[3:17:19] This shall be given. Seek,
[3:17:24] you shall find.
[3:17:27] What if you have need of?
[3:17:29] Speak it.
[3:17:41] That's it. Bless your people, Father.
[3:17:45] All these that come
[3:17:55] They are the evidence
[3:17:58] of your calling. They are the evidence
[3:18:01] [music] of your voice.
[3:18:03] They are the evidence
[3:18:06] of a prophetic ministry.
[3:18:24] Hallelujah. I was overcome
[3:18:40] I'm ready to
[3:19:08] keep coming.
[3:19:10] Each one of you, you keep coming. You
[3:19:13] keep putting one foot in front of
[3:19:15] another. You keep walking. You walk in
[3:19:18] the light. You serve him every day. If
[3:19:22] you fall down, you get up. You keep
[3:19:25] coming. If you fight, you keep fighting.
[3:19:28] If you fall down, somebody will pick you
[3:19:30] up.
[3:19:33] I got your back.
[3:19:38] Amen.
[3:19:41] Bless your people tonight.
[3:20:12] God bless you.
[3:20:14] I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.
[3:20:17] God bless you.
[3:20:25] Amen.
[3:20:41] God bless you.
[3:20:49] They're
[3:21:02] your people.
[3:21:05] They are the evidence.

[3:22:03] don't matter all the things you've gone
[3:22:05] through and the things that have
[3:22:06] happened. Don't you ever get discouraged
[3:22:09] and look down because you are the
[3:22:11] evidence.
[3:22:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:22:14] &gt;&gt; One day you will walk those streets.
[3:22:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[3:22:21] You are ordained to overcome. [snorts]
[3:22:26] Seize the day.
[3:22:28] Be about your father's business.
[3:22:34] Hallelujah.
[3:22:36] Yes, brother.
[3:22:44] You're the
[3:22:46] sister,
[3:22:48] a mother in Christ. God's called you
[3:22:52] when you as a little girl.
[3:22:55] You've known it your whole life.
[3:23:02] God bless you.
[3:23:05] Be all you can be for Christ.
[3:23:10] Don't you ever get discouraged and don't
[3:23:13] you forget who you are.
[3:23:54] I love you.
[3:24:20] God bless you. Just
[3:24:47] the things you've gone through.
[3:24:53] Bless you. Bless you.
[3:24:59] God bless you.
[3:25:10] predestinated.
[3:25:13] He was born to receive this
[3:25:22] whole world.
[3:25:52] shall prosper.
[3:25:57] If you believe him, you'll prosper.
[3:26:14] I bless you.
[3:26:25] Amen.
[3:26:31] Father's business.
[3:26:44] He said, "I'll be with you.
[3:26:48] [snorts]
[3:28:01] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[3:28:32] [snorts]
[3:29:03] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and set one bread.
[3:29:22] I've never gotten myself
[3:30:01] Did you hear
[3:30:29] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[3:30:35] &gt;&gt; For as often as you do eat of this bread
[3:30:38] and drink of this cup, you do.
[3:30:46] Thank you for
[3:30:49] Thank you for the
[3:30:52] It was broken.
[3:31:01] Thank you for
[3:31:15] Thank you, brother. God bless you.
[3:31:30] By my watch, we have a couple two, three
[3:31:33] minutes. And by that one up there, we
[3:31:35] got four minutes.
[3:31:37] And what I'd like you to do,
[3:31:40] [snorts] you that have family here, get
[3:31:42] with your family. Get up right now. And
[3:31:46] if you children have a mother and
[3:31:48] father, go get with mom and dad. Yeah,
[3:31:51] I'll come to you. I'll come to you.
[3:31:57] This is a family affair.
[3:32:03] So I would like to if you brethren go
[3:32:06] ahead and put some music on for us
[3:32:09] there, brother John, please
[3:32:12] just something softly.
[3:32:17] And if you want to kneel, kneel.
[3:32:20] Yeah.
[3:32:25] But we want to go into the new year.
[3:32:26] I'll tell you how much I believe in
[3:32:29] going to into the new year on my knees.
[3:32:33] That when I was in Europe and we had no
[3:32:35] church to go to, there was one night
[3:32:39] that I gathered my family in the upper
[3:32:42] room and we all knelt down. Do you
[3:32:43] remember that, Rebecca?
[3:32:47] God bless you as we go.
[3:39:08] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[3:42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:42:59] God bless you.
[3:43:02] It's a new year.
[3:43:06] It will be a good year.
[3:43:11] It will be a year of victories,
[3:43:15] &gt;&gt; more victories
[3:43:17] than defeat.
[3:43:24] There's a movement in America
[3:43:27] called the turning point.
[3:43:35] That's a natural reflection of something
[3:43:37] that's spiritually been going on for
[3:43:39] quite some time.
[3:43:42] How many of you
[3:43:46] have already had your turning point
[3:43:48] &gt;&gt; when you heard the voice
[3:43:51] &gt;&gt; of the seventh angel?
[3:43:52] &gt;&gt; I shall turn aside. I shall go and
[3:43:56] listen and I will see what is this
[3:43:58] attraction.
[3:44:00] What is all this
[3:44:03] mystery? What is all these signs for?
[3:44:09] Amen.
[3:44:12] Where is Sister Perfect? Is she still
[3:44:14] here?
[3:44:17] &gt;&gt; Sister Perfect.
[3:44:20] Come here.
[3:44:22] I want you to sing your song again.
[3:44:27] &gt;&gt; That was anointed.
[3:44:30] Is that you, Brother Owen?
[3:44:34] God bless you. It's been years.
[3:44:38] Brother Owen Jurgensson, the one who
[3:44:40] wrote the
[3:44:43] books.
[3:44:47] Many people have been blessed because of
[3:44:49] what you wrote, brother Owen.
[3:44:59] Sister Perfect, where did you get that
[3:45:01] song?
[3:45:11] I want them to hear it. What? Where?
[3:45:14] Where? Where did you get this song?
[3:45:17] &gt;&gt; Um, this is a song that the Lord gave me
[3:45:20] and I wrote No, I didn't write it. The
[3:45:23] Lord wrote it through me.
[3:45:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[3:45:26] &gt;&gt; Do you know how original songs
[3:45:30] come to pass?
[3:45:37] through fiery trials.
[3:45:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:45:41] &gt;&gt; And through the things you go through,
[3:45:43] you know what God does?
[3:45:45] &gt;&gt; He births
[3:45:47] &gt;&gt; a song. Would you [music] sing this song
[3:45:50] because that blessed me and you sing it
[3:45:52] at the the God gave you that song that
[3:45:57] you might bless me
[3:45:59] &gt;&gt; because guess what?
[3:46:02] &gt;&gt; I am the evidence.
[3:46:04] &gt;&gt; Sing it for me.
[3:46:14] Just like Shemah [music]
[3:46:17] in the Bible,
[3:46:19] with all he went through, he fought by
[3:46:23] faith
[3:46:24] with God by [singing] his side,
[3:46:30] overcoming [music] his enemies.
[3:46:32] [singing]
[3:46:33] In one day, God lifted him. He was the
[3:46:38] evidence that [singing] God conquers
[3:46:41] all.
[3:46:44] Oh, [singing] we are the evidence of the
[3:46:47] truth. Yes, the evidence of his [music]
[3:46:51] word. Don't give up nor give in.
[3:46:56] He has given us [singing] the [music]
[3:46:58] key.
[3:47:00] Oh Satan, you are late. Whatever [music]
[3:47:03] you throw at us won't last. You are
[3:47:07] dealing with a [music] victorious
[3:47:10] [singing] pride.
[3:47:13] Oh, we are the evidence of the truth.

[3:47:38] victorious
[3:47:40] bride.
[3:47:42] We are reminded
[3:47:45] of her night. She cried all [singing]
[3:47:48] day and night.
[3:47:50] Oh Lord,
[3:47:52] do not pass me by. [singing]
[3:47:57] Through her praise and supplications,
[3:48:01] our God delivered [music and singing]
[3:48:03] her and by faith she held the evidence
[3:48:07] in her arms.
[3:48:10] Oh, [singing] we are the evidence of the
[3:48:13] truth. Yes, the evidence of his word.
[3:48:18] Don't give up. No ging.
[3:48:20] [music and singing]
[3:48:22] He has given us the key.
[3:48:26] Oh, Satan, [music and singing]

[3:48:31] won't last. You are dealing with a
[3:48:35] victorious [singing and music]
[3:48:37] bride.
[3:48:39] Now in our lives, we've seen it all. The
[3:48:43] ups and downs, [music] the pain, the
[3:48:45] grief. And now God [singing]
[3:48:49] has been by [music] our side.
[3:48:53] It's not by chance we've conquered all,
[3:48:57] but by [music] grace and grace alone. Or
[3:49:00] we are the evidence that God is still
[3:49:05] alive. [singing]
[3:49:07] Oh, we are the evidence of the truth.
[3:49:11] [music] Yes, the evidence of his word.
[3:49:15] Don't give [singing] up, no give in. He

[3:49:22] Oh, Satan, you are [music] late.
[3:49:25] Whatever you throw at us won't last. You
[3:49:29] are dealing [music and singing]
[3:49:31] with a victorious
[3:49:33] pride.
