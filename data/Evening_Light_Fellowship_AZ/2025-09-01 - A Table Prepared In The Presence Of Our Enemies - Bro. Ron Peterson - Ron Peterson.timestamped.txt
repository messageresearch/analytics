[7:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; How many are glad for the change that's
[7:03] been made in your life?
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Can't go back. I won't go back. Amen.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Before we go to the Lord, let's sing. We
[7:10] need you, Lord. We need you, Lord. If
[7:13] you need him this morning, lift your
[7:14] hand as we worship him. Throw your need
[7:17] at his feet this morning. We need you,
[7:21] Lord.

[7:27] right now. Throw your need upon his
[7:30] feet.

[7:57] and bow our knees
[8:01] and worship
[8:04] at your throne.
[8:09] We need you Lord.
[8:13] We need you Lord.
[8:18] Make it personal this morning. I need
[8:20] you, Lord.
[8:25] Yes, I need you, Lord.
[8:29] [Music]
[8:30] I need you, Lord,
[8:33] right now.
[8:37] [Music]
[8:42] I need you, Lord.
[8:46] I need you, Lord,

[8:58] I lift my hands

[9:09] at
[9:11] your throne.
[9:15] I need you Lord.
[9:19] I need you, Lord,
[9:23] right now.
[9:27] Amen. He is here this morning to meet
[9:29] each and every need. Amen. I'd like to
[9:31] ask brother James love all if you'd come
[9:32] this morning, Brother James, and open
[9:34] our service in prayer and just take
[9:36] these requests before the Lord. We have
[9:38] a thank you card this morning from
[9:40] Sister Lori, Brother Randy Snow, and
[9:42] their family. and they say, "We just
[9:44] want to take a moment to thank you first
[9:46] of all for the many prayers on my
[9:48] behalf." God has been so merciful. We
[9:52] have witnessed so many supernatural
[9:53] touches that only he can give.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; I know for sure it's been the prayers of
[9:57] all the saints, also for your
[9:59] generosity, the gift that was given to
[10:01] assist towards our financial needs that
[10:03] is so humbling. But we thank you from
[10:06] the bottom of our hearts and looking
[10:07] forward to what the Lord has in store.
[10:09] Amen. God bless each one of you. The
[10:11] snows. So let's pray. Lord, continue to
[10:14] be the sister Lori and grant her a
[10:16] complete and full recovery. Just thank
[10:18] the Lord for what he's already done for
[10:20] her.
[10:22] Sister Josie Robless this morning says,
[10:23] "I want to praise and thank our Lord. My
[10:26] brother Arthur Banks is in hospice, but
[10:29] he's now walking and talking, smiling,
[10:32] showing progress." So I want to thank
[10:33] the Lord. So let's continue to remember
[10:35] her brother Arthur Banks in prayer. Pray
[10:37] the Lord continue to be with him.
[10:40] Amen. Sister Joy Brander turned in
[10:43] request this morning. She says, "Please
[10:44] remember my c-orker Elizabeth and her
[10:46] family in prayer. Her husband was found
[10:49] unresponsive last week after an MRI
[10:52] yesterday. They've conclude concluded he
[10:55] is brain dead. She has three boys and a
[10:58] very serious decision to make. They do
[11:01] not know the Lord personally. They need
[11:02] comfort and salvation." So, let's
[11:05] remember this coworker named Elizabeth
[11:06] and her family. Pray the Lord would just
[11:09] come upon the scene for them.
[11:12] Amen. Sister Nancy Tempe has two prayer
[11:14] requests. One this morning for brother
[11:17] brother Jim needs a healing touch. He's
[11:19] been having some prostate issues for a
[11:22] biopsy on Tuesday. So, we're asking the
[11:24] Lord to remember brother Jim in prayer
[11:28] and also Sister Nancy's
[11:32] asking the the amazing church family to
[11:34] continue to pray for me as I start a new
[11:36] process in my cancer journey.
[11:39] Will take 90 days. She starts rigorous
[11:41] testing in the next two weeks. They're
[11:44] going to be taking her white blood
[11:46] cells, be modifying them, she says into
[11:49] Seal six, Seal Team Six Snipers. So,
[11:53] sounds pretty interesting. But whatever
[11:55] they're going to do, let's pray the Lord
[11:56] just be with Sister Nancy and these
[11:58] treatments that she's going to be
[11:59] undergoing. They're be putting the cells
[12:01] back into her body on October the 15th,
[12:06] hoping for a positive result. So, let's
[12:08] just pray. The Lord be with Sister
[12:09] Nancy. The Lord's brought her this far.
[12:12] He can complete the healing that he's
[12:13] already begun in her body. How many
[12:15] would have a need this morning? Just
[12:16] lift it before the Lord. Brother James,
[12:18] if you would come.
[12:20] A lot of people on the road for the
[12:21] holiday weekend. Pray Lord just be with
[12:23] them. Grant them traveling mercies.
[12:24] Brother James.
[12:27] [Music]
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads and our
[12:31] hearts.
[12:33] [Music]
[12:34] Our gracious heavenly father. Lord, we
[12:37] humbly approach your throne of mercy and
[12:39] grace.
[12:42] Father, we can pray and seek your face
[12:45] and have fellowship with you throughout
[12:47] the week. But Father, there's something
[12:49] special when we come into your house,
[12:52] Lord, when we bring our licks of fire
[12:54] together, oh God. Maybe there's some
[12:56] amongst us that Lord, they just need a
[13:00] another anointing of your Holy Spirit to
[13:02] come and to minister live. Father,
[13:05] there's needs that have come across this
[13:07] desk. Oh God, they've been pinned down,
[13:10] Lord, that they would present it in
[13:12] faith, oh God, that you would have your
[13:14] special way in their lives, oh God. And
[13:16] so we're just asking, Lord, that you
[13:18] would meet the needs of your people
[13:20] according to your will and to your way,
[13:22] oh God. Father, Brother Jim, and this
[13:26] Lord, Lady Elizabeth, oh God, and her
[13:28] husband and whatever the need is, Lord,
[13:30] brain dead. But Father, you're the very
[13:32] one that created our human bodies, oh
[13:34] God. And Lord, we're just asking that
[13:36] you would move in a special way, Father.
[13:40] And as we gathered this morning,
[13:42] Lord, we believe that as the word would
[13:44] go forth, that it would have an effect,
[13:47] Lord. Would our grounds be prepared,
[13:49] Father, for the hearing of your word,
[13:51] Lord, that it would bring forth life and
[13:53] liberty, oh God. That it would return,
[13:56] Lord. Your word would never return void,
[13:58] oh God. So, we're just asking that you
[14:01] would be in the song service that you
[14:03] would go and by the foolishness of
[14:05] preaching that you would touch lives.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Father, be with those that are out
[14:10] traveling. Would you give them traveling
[14:11] mercies, Father? And Lord, would you
[14:14] have your way this morning?
[14:15] &gt;&gt; We create, we ask, believe, and have
[14:19] faith that, Father, you would meet every
[14:21] need according to your will.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Move this morning. We commit it in thy
[14:26] hands in Jesus name. Amen.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother James. You may
[14:32] be seated this morning. Amen. It's good
[14:35] to be in the house of the Lord. Want to
[14:36] welcome each one here if you're visiting
[14:38] this morning streaming on the internet.
[14:40] Just a reminder, next Sunday, the 7th of
[14:43] September, we will be having communion
[14:45] and footwashing. 5:00 Sunday evening
[14:48] here at the church. So, looking forward
[14:50] to that. Then, well, as well, just a
[14:52] reminder, Sunday school starts next week
[14:55] and that'll start 9:20 over here in the
[14:57] singing room for the children. If you
[14:58] have not yet completed one of the
[15:00] information forms for your children, if
[15:02] you could pick one of those up on the
[15:03] bulletin board and get that completed,
[15:05] get that into the deacons or one of the
[15:07] Sunday school teachers. We get an idea
[15:09] as to how many children we've got, where
[15:10] they need to be, and contact
[15:12] information, all those sort of things.
[15:14] So would appreciate that. Amen. Thinking
[15:17] on the song yesterday, there is power.
[15:18] Power. There's power in the blood of the
[15:21] lamb this morning. Would you be free
[15:22] from your burden of sin? Amen. The blood
[15:25] is here this morning. Amen. Would you be
[15:28] free from your burden of sin? There's
[15:32] power in the blood. There's power in the
[15:36] blood. And what you are able to victory

[16:19] a cleansing.

[16:25] in the blood.

[17:37] There's power in the blood. And what you
[17:41] live daily is praises to sing. There's
[17:46] wonderful power in the blood.
[17:50] Oh, there is power, power, wonder work,

[18:36] glory. I trust you're happy this
[18:37] morning. We have a reason to be happy.

[20:10] clear. Living in the realm of praise.
[20:16] Oh, the Savior's presence is so near. I
[20:21] can see his smiling face.
[20:26] Oh, it is joy unspeakable,
[20:29] full of glory, full of glory, full of

[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; First time the name of Jesus was ever

[35:50] &gt;&gt; But we do it now.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody say Jesus.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Now in the name of Jesus,
[35:59] &gt;&gt; we come to you once again. and you said
[36:01] that when we would gather in that
[36:03] nameless,
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Father, that you would be in our midst.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; We acknowledge your sovereign presence
[36:13] here this morning. I pray, Lord Jesus,
[36:18] that thou will come. Anoint every hearer
[36:22] this morning. For you said,
[36:27] he that hath an ear, let him hear. what
[36:30] the spirit is saying. Therefore, Father,
[36:34] I pray may there be a quickening power
[36:36] of God.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; May you come down and anoint us once
[36:40] again, oh God,
[36:42] &gt;&gt; to not only read your word, but to
[36:44] understand it.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Give us that quickening power that comes
[36:49] by the revealed word.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; And then as the word is revealed, may it
[36:53] become a manifestation.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Father, I thank you. I praise you. meet
[36:58] every need. Whether it be a sickness,
[37:01] deliverance,
[37:03] whether it be marital issues,
[37:06] whatever it be, Father, we place it all
[37:08] at your feet and ask you
[37:12] in the name of Jesus that you come and
[37:15] meet every need. Lord,
[37:16] &gt;&gt; we ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you all this
[37:25] morning. Just remain standing. Amen.
[37:28] Turn with me in your Bibles to Amos
[37:31] chapter 8. Amos chapter 8. Amen. Praise
[37:35] the Lord. It's Labor Day weekend. Many
[37:37] are traveling. Um and we ask God for
[37:41] traveling mercies.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Um Amen. Brother Steven Love, he gave me
[37:47] a a ball cap. It's handed to me just
[37:51] before service. I guess a lot of you
[37:54] still have hair on top of your head and
[37:56] you don't need a cap. I need a cap and
[37:59] uh but I appreciate it, brother Stephen.
[38:02] Um you know the other day we were
[38:04] preaching on a prepared place for a
[38:06] prepared people
[38:07] &gt;&gt; but I didn't mention that there is all
[38:10] two prepared places
[38:12] heaven and hell.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Because hell he says I have prepared
[38:18] &gt;&gt; for the devil.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Listen to that enemy. Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Ah, take that. Yeah. Because there is a
[38:25] place prepared for the devil
[38:28] &gt;&gt; and his angels.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; But thank God that we won't be there.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[38:34] &gt;&gt; we've got another place.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're doing. We're here
[38:39] this morning to check up,
[38:41] &gt;&gt; make sure that we're prepared.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thank God for grace and mercy in
[38:46] our lives. I thank God that watch over
[38:49] us. Yes. Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; The other days, this is a little
[38:52] comical. You'll the wife and I, we were
[38:55] just doing a little uh decorating in in
[38:58] the home there in Prescat and and we're
[39:01] in the She wanted to put some stuff in
[39:03] the bathroom up against the wall and you
[39:06] have to step into the bathtub to hammer
[39:09] a little sign and do a little this and
[39:12] that. And so we're both standing in the
[39:14] tub and she's saying, "Okay, put the
[39:16] nail here." So I put the nail here. So,
[39:18] okay, do this over here. And so, like
[39:20] this. And Sandy steps back to take a
[39:23] look at it. Well, you're in the tub.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; She grabs me and we both go over whammo.
[39:30] Out of the tub onto the floor. We both
[39:32] look at one another.
[39:34] I I said, "So, who's going to get up
[39:37] first to help who to get up?"
[39:40] We
[39:43] big old bump on the back of my head. I
[39:46] said, you know, hey, we're getting too
[39:48] old to be falling out of the tub, but
[39:51] thank God. Anyway, thank God he watches
[39:54] over us.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles, please,
[39:58] to the book of Amos, chapter 8. Amos,
[40:02] chapter 8,
[40:07] verses 11-2. Behold, the days cometh,
[40:12] saith the Lord God, that I will send a
[40:14] famine in the land.
[40:16] Not a famine of bread,
[40:19] nor a thirst for water,
[40:22] but of hearing the words of the Lord.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; And they shall wander from sea to sea,
[40:30] and from north even to the east. They
[40:33] shall run to and fro to seek the word of
[40:36] the Lord
[40:37] and shall not find it.
[40:41] Amazing.
[40:43] It says
[40:45] the days will come when there'll be a
[40:47] famine in the land. He said, I'm not
[40:49] talking about a natural.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. talking about spiritual
[40:54] &gt;&gt; famines and droughts within the Bible
[40:57] are always a sign
[41:00] or a symbol of God's punishment because
[41:03] of people not listening to the word
[41:06] &gt;&gt; or being obedient to the word.
[41:10] they will
[41:12] uh seek they'll go here and there
[41:15] nowadays
[41:17] they'll go to the internet YouTube they
[41:19] will Google it
[41:22] they will ask Siri or Alexa
[41:27] or the computer give us an answer
[41:32] there's only one book that'll give you
[41:35] the answers for what you need and that's
[41:37] the Bible Amen.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our thumb.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; So, I think if you have a question,
[41:48] ask God.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Get in your prayer closet.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Get on your knees.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Seek God. He said, "If you'll ask, it
[41:57] shall be given."
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; If you seek, you shall find.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; You've got to do that.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; All right. in Matthew 24.
[42:11] Let's turn to Matthew 24 verses 44
[42:15] and 46.
[42:21] Matthew 24
[42:25] and verse 44.
[42:28] Therefore,
[42:29] be ye also ready,
[42:33] for in such an hour as you think not,
[42:35] the Son of Man cometh. Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Who then is a faithful and wise servant,
[42:42] &gt;&gt; whom the Lord hath made ruler over his
[42:46] household
[42:47] to give them meat
[42:50] in due season.
[42:52] Blessed is that servant
[42:55] whom his lord when he cometh shall find.
[42:59] So do he.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Who then is a wise and faithful servant.
[43:07] to give the people spiritual food
[43:11] &gt;&gt; in due season.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; When Jesus spoke to Peter, he said,
[43:17] "Peter, do you love me?" "Yes, Lord. You
[43:20] know I love you." Ask him three times.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Peter, do you love me?" "Yes,
[43:28] Lord, you know." And being a little
[43:30] grieved in his spirit, he said, "Feed my
[43:33] sheep."
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; That is what we are to do as ministers
[43:38] of the gospel.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; We are to go into those places, the
[43:43] prophet of God said, the word of God,
[43:44] message of the hour, and break it down
[43:47] and bring it to the people to feed you.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is our responsibility. We're
[43:53] not here to just tickle your ears. We're
[43:56] not here to just become emotional, but
[43:58] we are to get into the word of God
[44:01] &gt;&gt; and have some daily bread. Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; So turn with me now if you would uh to
[44:10] Psalms 23. Very familiar portion of
[44:14] scripture. And I'd like to read it as a
[44:18] congregation together.
[44:21] Psalms 23. And we'll read verses 1-6.
[44:25] And so if you all will be so kind, we'll
[44:28] read it together in unison. Let's start
[44:31] right now. The Lord is my shepherd. I
[44:36] shall not want. He maketh me to lie down
[44:39] in green pastures. He leadth me beside
[44:43] the still waters. He restoth my soul. He
[44:48] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[44:51] for his name's sake. Yay, though I walk
[44:54] through the valley of the shadow of
[44:56] death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
[45:00] with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they
[45:04] comfort me. Thou preparest a table
[45:07] before me in the presence of mine
[45:10] enemies. Thou anointest my head with
[45:13] oil. My cup runth over.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[45:19] me all the days of my life, and I will
[45:23] dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:31] and I will dwell in the house of the
[45:33] Lord forever.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[45:37] &gt;&gt; we thank you for your word.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; It's a comfort.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; It is a compass.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; It is a guide. It is a pattern.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; It is our destiny.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Show us another portion, Father, of thy
[45:54] great plan
[45:55] &gt;&gt; today. Feed us this day our daily bread.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. I pray that you will bless each and
[46:01] every one and now take this servant as I
[46:04] humble myself before you and I ask use
[46:07] our lips to speak something to feed thy
[46:10] people. I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[46:14] Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated this
[46:17] morning in the presence of the Lord.
[46:19] Amen.
[46:23] like to title my sermon this morning
[46:27] um a table prepared
[46:32] in the presence of mine enemy
[46:35] &gt;&gt; or our enemy.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; So there is a table prepared
[46:43] &gt;&gt; and I would like to take this morning
[46:45] for a subject the spiritual food in due
[46:48] season.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Now, spiritual food
[46:54] will come to you in due season,
[46:57] even as you mature and grow in Christ.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; We know that we all must mature, even as
[47:05] you see it in the natural, so it is in
[47:07] the spiritual.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; You do not take a newborn baby and try
[47:12] to feed them strong meat
[47:15] &gt;&gt; because they can't take it.
[47:17] See, but as they grow, God gives them
[47:20] teeth, gives them the ability to
[47:23] assimulate what they're eating
[47:26] into their bodies and stuff. And so, uh,
[47:31] I pray that each one of you
[47:35] are mature Christians
[47:38] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says that strong meat
[47:40] belongth to them who are of full age.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. They've come to a maturity.
[47:46] They're able to take the strong meat of
[47:49] the word and they're they though you
[47:52] were raised on the sincere milk of the
[47:55] word and the love of God and those
[47:58] things as a young Christian, but as you
[48:00] grow, you begin to now begin to catch
[48:05] things that you didn't catch when you
[48:08] were younger.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And so I thank God for that. But what we
[48:12] need
[48:14] is for God to give us spiritual
[48:16] understanding of the word of God.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Now food and water are necessary
[48:23] commodities for us to be able to uh live
[48:27] and u and have a life in this lifetime.
[48:33] But the prophet Amos there was saying
[48:35] there's coming a day when they're going
[48:38] to go from east to west. They're going
[48:41] to be a famine in the land. They're
[48:43] going to be seeking and they're not
[48:46] going to find it.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Because you have to understand God will
[48:51] set a table prepared.
[48:54] But if you refuse, if you reject,
[48:58] &gt;&gt; you understand then then what happens?
[49:01] Then a famine comes upon the people
[49:04] &gt;&gt; and uh you know you can only be bidden
[49:07] so many times. How many understand that
[49:10] that there is a a limit to God says uh
[49:14] uh ask the people to come and he says
[49:17] prepare the feast. I've I've bid them to
[49:19] come but there's coming a time when it
[49:22] says but Lord they they've refused. They
[49:25] one went to uh uh uh he he bought a cow,
[49:29] another bought some land, and they gave
[49:31] all these excuses. My brother, my
[49:33] sister, let none of us have any kind of
[49:36] an excuse of why not to get into those
[49:40] things that we see in this our day.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God for this hour.
[49:47] Lord.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Now
[49:51] I want to take in the direction this
[49:53] morning that there is a table prepared
[49:57] &gt;&gt; in the presence of your enemies.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; So God does this openly. Right?
[50:04] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to do it in a corner or
[50:08] in some hidden place,
[50:10] &gt;&gt; but he does it so that you will have a
[50:14] place even in the midst of your enemies.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amongst the scoffers
[50:20] and all of those who want to reject
[50:24] God's word, God says, "I'll prepare a
[50:27] table for you."
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Brennan P picks this
[50:34] up in Jezebel religion and he says, "Now
[50:39] God sends forth a message and tells the
[50:42] people and they don't receive it. Then
[50:46] he withdraws his servant and sends his
[50:49] plagues, famine, death,
[50:53] spiritually speaking, physically also.
[50:57] You watch for a depression, brother. You
[51:00] think you've seen something, just wait
[51:02] after a while.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; You haven't seen nothing.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; You think you're dying for a good
[51:08] spiritual revival, you wait till after a
[51:11] bit. You just wait long and cry to hear
[51:15] the word of God. The Bible said so.
[51:18] There'll be a famine in the last days,
[51:21] said the prophet. And not for bread and
[51:24] water alone, but for hearing the true
[51:26] word of God. Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; But that voice will be quiet in the
[51:30] wilderness somewhere, hid away.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; We are now in the midst of this
[51:36] prophecy, my brother, my sister.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; In the midst of a time when famine is
[51:43] here. There's all kinds of ministries.
[51:47] There's all kinds of preachers. There's
[51:49] all kinds of different ones that say
[51:52] that they are called of God.
[51:55] And I'm not here to try to talk about
[51:59] that, but I want to say that it is the
[52:04] ministry's responsibility
[52:07] to preach
[52:09] spiritual food
[52:11] &gt;&gt; in due season.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think it's the time now that the
[52:18] bride, listen to me carefully, the bride
[52:22] herself has come into the place. This is
[52:25] not the orchestration of man. This is
[52:28] not man's doing.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit around the world is
[52:34] bringing the people into a far greater
[52:38] understanding than they've ever had
[52:40] before.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; The word is becoming unveiled.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; The word is unfolding in such a way
[52:49] &gt;&gt; that it has an effect.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It must have an effect on you.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; It's not just knowledge I'm talking
[52:59] about.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; It's not just teachings,
[53:03] &gt;&gt; but it must have an effect that your
[53:05] life has changed.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; It's hard to find a message church
[53:18] nowadays that's giving a seven course
[53:21] meal.
[53:23] that's feeding the
[53:26] full menu.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're lucky to get a slice of
[53:35] bread.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; You know, when I was growing up,
[53:41] uh,
[53:43] we ate a lot of bread at our house, but
[53:45] my mom bought that Wonder white bread.
[53:49] Wonderbread.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we loved to eat that Wonder
[53:52] White bread. We'd make peanut butter and
[53:54] jelly sandwiches and boy, you to put it
[53:56] on there and you could eat five of them
[54:00] because that bread was just there. Well,
[54:01] there wasn't much to it. You just, you
[54:04] know, and it wasn't until uh after that.
[54:08] And you talk about wonderbread, you
[54:10] wonder what's in it.
[54:12] But I uh when I got married, my wife,
[54:15] she started baking her own bread
[54:19] and she started milling her own wheat
[54:21] and making wheat bread and and when
[54:23] you've got homemade bread and there's
[54:25] substance,
[54:27] &gt;&gt; there's something there. Let me tell
[54:29] you, you got to chew it.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; You got to chew it. There's something
[54:33] there. Yeah.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; A sandwich made with homemade bread with
[54:37] real wheat seed in it. Let me tell you,
[54:40] &gt;&gt; it'll fill you up.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's not like these little wonder
[54:46] sandwiches that you've been making as a
[54:48] kid.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; All of the fluff.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; God, give us something with substance.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; God, give our ministry. God, give us
[54:59] here in this
[55:00] &gt;&gt; this pulpit
[55:02] &gt;&gt; a time where A full course meal is set
[55:07] before you.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Everyone loves to sit at a table that's
[55:12] well prepared.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; I remember that when before I got
[55:20] married and we were single brothers in
[55:23] the church in Flagstaff,
[55:25] Sister Py Patterson would invite us to
[55:29] come over for dinner and she set a
[55:31] table. If you've never been at her home
[55:33] for a meal,
[55:38] my we she brother Mike could say,
[55:40] "Sister Paty's invited you boys for
[55:42] dinner tonight." Well, we wouldn't eat
[55:43] breakfast or lunch
[55:46] cuz we were under such expectation.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Why? The table was set and the butter
[55:52] and the gravy and the meat and
[55:54] everything. And we just couldn't wait.
[55:57] And I'll tell you, when you're when
[55:59] you're expecting
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Even as you walk up the door, you
[56:06] can smell something cooking. Huh? How
[56:09] many of you have ever gone somewhere and
[56:11] and or you're you're crossing the
[56:13] street, you're going to your restaurant,
[56:15] you you get a whiff of the smell. You
[56:17] You're already you're salivating. You're
[56:19] something. There's something about I
[56:20] can't wait.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Give me some.
[56:27] Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; So,
[56:35] I want something that's got substance.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; I want wheat seed.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; I want something that's going to going
[56:44] to make me uh have some power
[56:48] &gt;&gt; and nourishment.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Give me something. Because if we're not
[56:52] careful, we're eating the wrong kind of
[56:54] food and you get weak.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; You got to take a nap all the time.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you, if you get into the
[57:01] real good kind of food, it'll give you
[57:04] power.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; It'll give you something to run around
[57:08] about.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cause you to move.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Get into action.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; My wife, she went to the And I know she
[57:21] tells me, "Don't tell those stories."
[57:24] She went to the grocery store yesterday
[57:25] and she bought these little round
[57:28] potatoes about the size of a golf ball.
[57:30] Then she realized, "Oh, I probably need
[57:32] two of those. Two bags." Well, she only
[57:34] had one. She and she told the lady at
[57:38] the register, "Can you hang on? I'll

[57:48] ran all the way back, got the bag of
[57:50] potato, and came back. And she says,
[57:51] "Honey, I surprised myself if somebody
[57:55] would have known how old I am
[57:57] &gt;&gt; and that I'm a grandma and I'm running
[57:59] through the store with a bag of
[58:01] potatoes."
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I tell you, my brother, my sister,
[58:10] God, give us something,
[58:12] &gt;&gt; okay?
[58:13] &gt;&gt; That will cause a nourishment within us.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Okay? Not just not just something that
[58:20] gets you. I don't want a filler.

[58:32] sermon that is God full of vitamins and
[58:35] nourishment. You'll be chewing on it for
[58:37] days.

[58:40] talking about it as you're going home
[58:41] from church. You say, "My, did you did
[58:45] you chew on that? Did you hear what he
[58:47] said? Did you think about that quote?
[58:50] Wow. There's something about it. You
[58:53] just get into it. You chew on it for
[58:54] days.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; The brothers when we get together on
[58:58] Monday morning.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; I tell you. And and they're just there
[59:02] excited and they're been talking and
[59:04] they've got quotes and they're talking

[59:10] "Yes, brother. Yes. That's what it's all
[59:14] about.

[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; I love it when you get men excited.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Listen, my brother, my could care less
[59:23] who's playing the Super Bowl.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; I could care less who's winning
[59:28] basketball or any of that. Give me
[59:32] someone who's been wanting to have
[59:35] fellowship around the word.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not interested in politics.
[59:40] I'm not interested
[59:42] &gt;&gt; in those kind of things. I'm interested
[59:44] in talking about our inheritance.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Getting into the substance,
[59:50] something that I can chew on.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Something that's got eternal value.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] You know, we all go through things. I
[1:00:06] look in the scriptures and I see Elijah
[1:00:09] how he has a Mount Mount Carmel
[1:00:11] experience.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's up there and and he kills 450
[1:00:16] false prophets up there at Mount Carmel.
[1:00:19] And what a what a you talk about a
[1:00:22] one-man army.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; And we find in First Kings, I just want
[1:00:28] to show you something to show you a
[1:00:30] type. First Kings chapter 19 verses 1-8.
[1:00:34] And Ahab told Jezebel
[1:00:38] all that Elijah had done, and with all
[1:00:42] how he had slain all the prophets with
[1:00:44] the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger
[1:00:48] unto Elijah,
[1:00:50] saying, "So let the gods do to me, and
[1:00:53] more also,
[1:00:56] if I make not thy life as the life of
[1:00:58] one of them by tomorrow and about this
[1:01:01] time."
[1:01:04] And when he saw that, he arose and went
[1:01:06] for his life.
[1:01:09] Wait a second.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Here's a guy.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; That has just killed 450
[1:01:15] false prophets with the sword.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, when the anointing's on
[1:01:19] you,
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; let me tell you, you're left and right.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; You're going to slay the lion, the bear,
[1:01:29] Goliath. It don't matter. Come on, baby.
[1:01:32] You want a part of this?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; And here Elijah just
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; slew them all.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; I and I alone.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; the word comes to him. Now watch when
[1:01:46] the anointing is gone.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Watch. After good meetings, be careful.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; After you've won a great victory, the
[1:01:55] next day
[1:01:57] the devil's all upset. Oh yeah. You
[1:02:00] think you think you got a blessing, then
[1:02:03] he steal it from you. How many know what
[1:02:05] I'm talking about? Brother Brandham
[1:02:06] said, "Be careful. Even Mondays for
[1:02:09] ministers are a hard day
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; because they done stirred up the nest
[1:02:13] the day before."
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; So now the anointing has left him.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; And what amazes me is he runs from a
[1:02:22] woman.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; A woman.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; You would think he'd stomp right out.
[1:02:29] Okay, Jezebel, come here. But no, he
[1:02:32] runs. So, look at this now.
[1:02:35] He arose and went for his life and came
[1:02:37] to Beersa, which belongth to Judah, and
[1:02:40] left his servant there. And he himself
[1:02:42] went a day's journey into the
[1:02:44] wilderness. Brother Bram said he ran a
[1:02:46] marathon.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; He did. He run 30 miles. He
[1:02:52] Jezebel.
[1:02:54] He gets out there
[1:02:56] into the wilderness and came and sat
[1:02:58] down under a juniper tree and he
[1:03:01] requested for himself that he might die.
[1:03:05] Here's Elijah.
[1:03:07] Take my life.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Any of you ever gotten like that?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Any of you ever had situations where you
[1:03:14] say, "I might as well die. Go ahead,
[1:03:16] God. Take my life." What? I'm Huh?
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Little pity party at home. Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; It is enough now, oh Lord, take away my
[1:03:26] life, for I am not better than my
[1:03:29] father's, and he lay and slept under a
[1:03:31] juniper tree.
[1:03:34] Beheld,
[1:03:35] then an angel touched him and said unto
[1:03:37] him, "Arise and eat." Now, wait just a
[1:03:40] second. Let me give you a quote. I'm
[1:03:43] just I'm paraphrasing it. He said, "God
[1:03:47] in heaven knew that Elijah
[1:03:50] was in trouble and he was deeply
[1:03:54] vexed in his spirit."
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And so while he slept, he sought God did
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; for the angel with the softest palms of
[1:04:04] the head
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; to brush the brow of Elijah.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:17] So after he asked that he might die and
[1:04:20] take away my life, he slept under a
[1:04:22] juniper tree. And there an angel tells
[1:04:25] him, touched him and said unto him,
[1:04:27] "Arise and eat." And he looked, and
[1:04:30] beheld, there was a cake bacon on the
[1:04:32] coals and a cruise of water at his head.
[1:04:35] And he did eat and drink, and laid down
[1:04:37] again.
[1:04:39] He's He's taking a nap. Oh, this is so
[1:04:42] good. said, "Oh, he eats and sleeps." I
[1:04:46] get that way after a nice meal. And the
[1:04:50] angel of the Lord came again the second
[1:04:52] time and touched him again
[1:04:56] said, "Arise and eat." Because the
[1:04:58] journey
[1:05:01] is too great for you.
[1:05:05] Sometimes, saints of God, I want you to
[1:05:06] understand, God is very, very mindful of
[1:05:09] what you're going through. And sometimes
[1:05:11] the journey
[1:05:13] that you're the trial,
[1:05:16] the issue you're about to go through may
[1:05:18] be too great.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; So God is mindful.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; And he arose and did eat and drink and
[1:05:30] went on the strength of that meat 40
[1:05:34] days and 40 nights unto Horeb, the mount
[1:05:39] of God.
[1:05:40] I say, "God,
[1:05:42] give me some of that angel's food.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Give me some of that kind of cake
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; that won't just hold me until the
[1:05:50] evening, won't hold me throughout from
[1:05:52] Monday to Friday, but God, give me
[1:05:55] something that for 40 days and 40
[1:05:57] nights, I don't even need to eat or
[1:05:59] drink."
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, you talk that that's something that
[1:06:03] Red Bull knows nothing about.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] Yes. Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; 40 days and 40 nights.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Baked fresh from the coals of God.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Sustain the profit for his journey.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; See, when the anointing is on you, the
[1:06:26] enemy leaves you alone. He'll back away.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, he will.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; But when the anointing leaves you and
[1:06:32] you don't feel it,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; and sometimes you wonder, "Am I even
[1:06:36] saved? I don't even feel like I'm saved.
[1:06:38] I don't feel like I'm the elect of God.
[1:06:41] If I was the elect of God, why am I
[1:06:44] going through what I'm going through?
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "And what hearest
[1:06:52] thou Elijah?"
[1:06:55] He called them together, and the God of
[1:06:57] heaven answered in a supernatural sign
[1:07:00] to Israel that he was still the God that
[1:07:03] could answer by fire. And he did just
[1:07:06] what he always did. Answers prayer and
[1:07:08] he kept his word.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that God
[1:07:12] still keeps his word.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; And after all that, this still still it
[1:07:19] wasn't sufficient.
[1:07:22] And that little old Elijah didn't know
[1:07:24] what to do and he run to the juniper
[1:07:26] tree. I'm glad there is a juniper tree.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; All God's people
[1:07:34] Yes.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Needs to go to that juniper.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; All of God's people
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; need a place.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; There are times that I just got to get
[1:07:53] alone.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; The wife can't comfort you. Your dog
[1:07:57] can't comfort you. Nobody, your kids,
[1:07:59] anything. Huh?
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; You just need him. That's right.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; It's a place where he was so
[1:08:08] discouraged. He didn't know what to do.
[1:08:11] So, he ran out to himself himself and
[1:08:14] got under that juniper tree.
[1:08:19] Many of us feel like going there.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; I've been there times in my life
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; when I'm so distraught, so discouraged,
[1:08:28] so
[1:08:30] just frustrated. Any of you ever just
[1:08:32] get frustrated?
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; You don't feel his presence? You try to
[1:08:41] read and
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; seems like there's nothing there.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Nobody seems to understand and you don't
[1:08:48] know why. I
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; don't know why.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you, there is a place.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; And God is mindful of each and every one
[1:08:59] of you. And when you get to that place,
[1:09:02] if you'll understand, God can be touched
[1:09:06] by the feeling of your infirmity. He
[1:09:09] knows what is in your mind. He knows
[1:09:12] what you're going through. And even when
[1:09:14] you cannot help yourself,
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; God is there and he's willing.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And he will meet you.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; But you may have to go through some
[1:09:25] things.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:30] I don't want just uh good sermons.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; I want something. Here's what I've been
[1:09:37] praying about.
[1:09:40] And I've been asking God, God, I know
[1:09:43] that the ministry of the the five-fold
[1:09:48] ministry within the bride of Jesus
[1:09:50] Christ because they asked the prophet,
[1:09:54] "Will the bride of Christ have a
[1:09:56] ministry before the coming of the Lord?"
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes." Uh-huh.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. He said, "But it'll be ever so
[1:10:04] simple."
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what's going on now.
[1:10:08] apostles, prophets, evangelists,
[1:10:09] pastors, teachers.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; He and and my brother, my sister, it's
[1:10:16] not just one gift.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; It's five gifts.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; God gave gifted men. God called. God
[1:10:24] ordained.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Men to preach the gospel.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; This message doesn't carry itself. The
[1:10:32] ark of God did not gravitate by itself
[1:10:36] by a supernatural levitating power
[1:10:38] through the wilderness. No, it was
[1:10:41] carried over the hearts of the Levites.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And then God is still doing it. This
[1:10:46] message,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; these tapes, the books, they just don't
[1:10:51] find an address and go there. There's
[1:10:54] somebody that's preaching this gospel
[1:10:57] that's getting the people excited. Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Everywhere we go when we preach the
[1:11:02] gospel, we come back. People
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; they write to voice of God. They write
[1:11:06] different places and say, "Send me the
[1:11:08] book. Send me the tape.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; God, help us." That's ministry.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to preach my message.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; I've only got one message.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I'm just a postman.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; I'm delivering a letter.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:27] Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Blessed are they that
[1:11:33] hunger and thirst
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; for righteousness, for they shall be
[1:11:38] filled."
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, they will. Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:11:46] if the ministry has been feeding from an
[1:11:49] open book,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:11:52] If they've been catching the revelation,
[1:11:55] the congregation then is also feeding
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; from the open book.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; What is it? Revelation striking the
[1:12:03] people. Huh? Not just some kind of uh
[1:12:06] fluffy stuff that gets you all uh get
[1:12:09] some head knowledge in here about some
[1:12:11] kind of dimension and over here and a
[1:12:14] graph here and the people ooh and awe by
[1:12:16] all that. But we need something that'll
[1:12:19] stick to our ribs. We need something
[1:12:21] that gives us power tomorrow when we
[1:12:24] when we leave church and we go out there
[1:12:25] and you face the enemy and you will see
[1:12:28] him. I need something to overcome the
[1:12:30] enemy.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; I need to have power in my life. God,
[1:12:33] give me a nourishment.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; That only comes from you.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Give me this day
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; my daily bread. Amen.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; And the seal of the antichrist, brother
[1:12:47] Bram says, more preaching is being done
[1:12:51] than ever in the world and less practice
[1:12:53] than we ever did in all the world. More
[1:12:56] preaching, get less practice.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Men come in anointed with the of the
[1:13:03] Holy Spirit. They preach with everything
[1:13:06] that's within them. And the people walk
[1:13:08] right away as if nothing has ever
[1:13:10] happened.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. just unconcerned. Now, there's got
[1:13:14] to be a reason for that.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; See, and study this. It tells you what
[1:13:19] the reason is. Did you know that the
[1:13:21] scripture says there'll be a time in the
[1:13:23] last days there'll be a famine, strike
[1:13:26] the land, not for bread and water, but
[1:13:28] for hearing of the word of God?
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; The men go from east and west, north,
[1:13:32] south, seek to hear the word of God, not
[1:13:35] shall shall not find it.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Just think of the times we're living in.
[1:13:40] And we're living in that time. I believe
[1:13:42] when the prophet spoke that he foresaw
[1:13:45] the United States of America
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; cuz it's the only place I know of would
[1:13:51] meet the description in this day.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Power of decision. Brother Brandham says
[1:14:01] this. Did you ever taste any of this
[1:14:05] spiritual mana? I've seen people get so
[1:14:08] much of it till they lick their lips.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Just a real gastronomical jubilee. Amen.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Spiritually speaking. Oh my. It fills
[1:14:19] you out.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; You know when you get real weak and get
[1:14:22] a great big square meal. How good do you
[1:14:25] feel?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's one of those times that
[1:14:28] you have to unbuckle the belt.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Huh? I tell you, God give us sermons
[1:14:34] that'll unbuckle our belt and you say,
[1:14:36] "My goodness, I'm so full of that."
[1:14:40] But I tell you, it's just a matter of
[1:14:42] time and that which you assimulated
[1:14:44] during that sermon, it'll be gone. I
[1:14:46] need some I need another meal. Hey,
[1:14:49] bring some more. I need more of that.
[1:14:51] Raise your hand this morning and say,
[1:14:53] "I'm ordering. I'm ordering right now. I
[1:14:56] want some more of that."
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; That's what you do in a restaurant. When
[1:15:06] you want a little bit more, you raise
[1:15:07] your hand.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, waiter.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Waitress. Hello.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Bring me some more.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; That's what you're doing in church.
[1:15:17] Raise your hand.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; I want some more.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; That's good. But I want more.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Give me another slice of meat. Huh?
[1:15:25] Don't be Yeah. We just went on the
[1:15:27] cruise. And I tell you, you know, on a
[1:15:29] cruise there, you've paid all that money
[1:15:31] and everything and then they got the
[1:15:32] buffet there before you, you know, and
[1:15:35] then they gave a little slice. No, give
[1:15:37] me another slice. No, one more. Put some
[1:15:39] juice on that thing.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I pass up all of the
[1:15:43] nonsense stuff. Huh? Yeah. I just go for
[1:15:48] the meat.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a carnivore.
[1:15:53] I want to eat lamb.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. Now, watch. He
[1:15:59] says, "That's what's the matter with the
[1:16:00] church today. It's anemia.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; They're they're not getting enough
[1:16:05] spiritual food.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, God help us
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; to get into this spiritual food
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; to get into it.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; It would be horrible to die of
[1:16:18] starvation
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; while living in a grocery store.
[1:16:25] Come on.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; If you're hungry, reach up.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Pull something down.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Rip it open.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; When you're hungry, huh? You know, I
[1:16:37] tell my wife, you know, she's fixing a
[1:16:39] meal or something and I'm in there and
[1:16:41] she says, "Honey, it's not ready yet."
[1:16:43] Well, I here, give me that package. I'll
[1:16:46] open it up. That can of tuna. Give it to
[1:16:48] me. What do you need done? Chop. Chop
[1:16:51] chop. Hurry up. I'm hungry.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not real patient when it comes
[1:16:58] to eating.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; No, I I have a sign. Hungry. Hungry. You
[1:17:03] know what hangry is? That it's an
[1:17:04] emotion that you have when you're extra
[1:17:08] hungry.
[1:17:10] My wife, she she tells me it's not ready
[1:17:12] yet. Well,
[1:17:14] I I can't wait. I go sit I'll sit at the
[1:17:16] table while she's still cooking. I'll
[1:17:19] sit there with my fork and knife and
[1:17:21] come on, bring it on. Anyway, I'm not
[1:17:24] let
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said in seeds not air
[1:17:32] with a shook. He said the real true
[1:17:34] elect seed doesn't eat just any kind of
[1:17:37] dead carrying.
[1:17:40] hop around from this church and that
[1:17:42] church and go over here and a little bit
[1:17:43] of dead carrying a little bit of of
[1:17:45] stuff from way back in another age and
[1:17:47] hop over here.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Huh? Eating all kinds of dead carrying
[1:17:56] it was from another age roadkill.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; No, give me the fresh meat of the word
[1:18:01] for this hour. I'll tell you that's you
[1:18:04] know even
[1:18:06] Sandy and I keep we have our morning
[1:18:09] devotions and we read our Bible and when
[1:18:11] we do
[1:18:13] we read two or three sentences or verses
[1:18:16] in scripture and she says you need to
[1:18:18] preach on that. This is so good. Look at
[1:18:20] that honey that is so good. Oh it is
[1:18:24] true. The word of God when you're under
[1:18:26] an anointing
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; every verse. Wow. Look at I never saw
[1:18:31] that underlining. Honey, you know, hey,
[1:18:33] give me that marker this that and and
[1:18:36] and you know, so much of the time,
[1:18:38] honey, you need to preach on that. You
[1:18:40] need to preach on that.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; What you Anyway,
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; write it down.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Write it down. That's true.
[1:18:51] Write it down. Because I'll tell you, if
[1:18:53] I don't speak it, sometimes I I'm old
[1:18:56] enough now that I start to say
[1:18:58] something. Johnny, I'll be talking to
[1:18:59] somebody and oh hey, you know, like this
[1:19:02] and somebody uninterrupt me and then
[1:19:03] I'll say okay well go ahead. What were
[1:19:05] you gonna say gone? It's in cyberspace,
[1:19:09] man. Huh? And certain thoughts, you
[1:19:12] know, oh man, that's good. I need to go
[1:19:13] write it down because if you don't write
[1:19:15] it down, you'll forget it.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; God help us. Huh? Take mental notes
[1:19:20] because there's things going on in your
[1:19:23] life and God is giving a little a little
[1:19:26] hint, a little clue. He's giving you a
[1:19:28] little something. Write it down because
[1:19:30] it's important that you can take that
[1:19:32] and meditate on it and pray about it and
[1:19:35] seek the mind of God because he wants to
[1:19:38] give you something. Let me tell you, my
[1:19:40] brother, my sister, God wants to give
[1:19:42] you something more than you wanted.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Meditate on the word.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; And after you get done reading and
[1:19:50] praying, why don't you just be still
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; because in the stillness
[1:19:57] He might speak.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; We get up after we're done.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; So quick.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; I've prayed. I' I've sought him. I asked
[1:20:07] God for an answer.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And before he can answer, I'm already
[1:20:12] up.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Got to go to work. Got to go do these
[1:20:19] things.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Well, how about after you're done,
[1:20:24] be still.
[1:20:26] and know that I am God.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Be still. Stop for a moment.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:20:38] You see, that's why John was told, "Come
[1:20:41] up hither, John." And immediately he was
[1:20:44] in the spirit.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, you got to get
[1:20:47] into the spirit of the word.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And then he was caught up. Come up
[1:20:54] hither, John.
[1:20:55] I want to show you things which is going
[1:20:58] to come to pass.
[1:21:00] And John was told to take the book and
[1:21:02] to eat it. And I want to repeat to all
[1:21:06] of you, take this revealed word and eat
[1:21:09] it
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; and simulate it into your bodies.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Into that spiritual man. Feed that
[1:21:15] spiritual man
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; on the spiritual food that is in due
[1:21:20] season. Yes.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I have many things I wanted
[1:21:27] to share with you, but I see you cannot
[1:21:30] bear it now.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; How be it after I'm gone,
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; he said, "The Holy Spirit will bring
[1:21:36] this to your remembrance."
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, there is a
[1:21:40] delayed reaction many times to what
[1:21:43] you've heard and you shove it and you
[1:21:46] say, "I don't understand that." God
[1:21:48] says, "That's okay. That's all right."
[1:21:51] and you shove it and you're you're doing
[1:21:53] the dishes, you're at home, you're
[1:21:55] sweeping the floor, you're at your job,
[1:21:58] you're driving your car, you're doing
[1:22:00] something and all of a sudden,
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; man,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden there comes a quickening
[1:22:06] from God
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; and he quickens your mind
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; and he brings to your remembrance. Thank
[1:22:12] God you got it on your hard drive.
[1:22:14] That's why faith cometh by hearing,
[1:22:16] hearing the word. And you may not
[1:22:18] understand it. Just log it.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Put it on your hard drive. Because if
[1:22:23] it's not on your hard drive, how can the
[1:22:25] Holy Spirit bring it to your
[1:22:27] remembrance? It's not there.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; That's why thank God some of you I know
[1:22:32] are not catching it. That's all right.
[1:22:34] Keep coming. Keep coming. Keep coming.
[1:22:36] Keep reading. Keep listening.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; You know what? One day all of a sudden,
[1:22:41] bang.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's right.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; In St. John 6, brother Brennham was
[1:22:55] telling us that the ministry of Jesus
[1:22:57] changed
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; from the first and second pole to third.
[1:23:03] Watch this. St. John 6 verse 53 through
[1:23:06] 58. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[1:23:09] verily, I say unto you, except you eat
[1:23:12] the flesh of the Son of Man,
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; and drink his blood, you have no life in
[1:23:16] you."
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; He's never said this before.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; He's never talked about, "You need to
[1:23:23] eat my flesh and drink my blood."
[1:23:26] Now,
[1:23:28] in the natural,
[1:23:30] to a carnal mind, you think this guy's a
[1:23:32] vampire.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; What do you mean eat your flesh?
[1:23:37] drink your blood.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Who so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my
[1:23:44] blood hath eternal life, and I'll raise
[1:23:47] him up in the last days.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; For my flesh is meat indeed, and my
[1:23:52] blood is drink indeed. And he that
[1:23:54] eateth my flesh and drinkketh my blood
[1:23:56] dwelleth in me and I in him. As the
[1:24:00] living father hath sent me, I live by
[1:24:03] the father, so that he that eateth me,
[1:24:06] even he shall live by me.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; This is that bread which came to he you
[1:24:13] know what he's doing? He's saying this
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; is the bread which came down from
[1:24:20] heaven.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I am the bread of life.
[1:24:24] This is the bread which came down from
[1:24:25] heaven.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Not as your fathers did eat mana. And it
[1:24:31] was heavenly mana.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; And are dead.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; He that eateth
[1:24:39] of this bread shall live forever.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; You know, in the time of the Welsh
[1:24:47] Revival,
[1:24:49] there were people that were hearing of a
[1:24:51] great revival going on in Wales. So they
[1:24:55] they went over there and they began and
[1:24:57] there was a little
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; policeman with got his little bat or
[1:25:02] whatever and he's swinging it like that
[1:25:04] and he said, "Sir, kind sir, can you
[1:25:06] please tell me where the Welsh Revival's
[1:25:08] at?"
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're looking at it."
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, where's the bridal?
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Where's the bride's revival?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Right here,
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; you're looking at it.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, it may not look on the outside, but
[1:25:23] inside.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's something going on.
[1:25:27] There's a transformation. It's
[1:25:29] happening.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's being changed from one glory
[1:25:32] to another glory.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; I'm being changed.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm getting more
[1:25:38] homesick.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but I am
[1:25:44] homesick.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; I want to go home.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Not Not this home.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Not the one I got a street address on.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; I want to go home.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Just talking about
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; home.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Is anybody feeling like
[1:26:12] that?
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I I'm I'm kind of sick of
[1:26:16] this world.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Where is the message of the hour?
[1:26:28] You're looking at it.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; It's left the tape.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; It's come off of the book.
[1:26:39] That's right.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; And it's become living.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; You become living epistles.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; I'm a living book.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; I'm a walking encyclopedia.
[1:26:58] Yes.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; You know, listen, once you have taken
[1:27:02] this message and the word of God and
[1:27:05] you've got it in your life,
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; it's not that you've memorized it.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; It's not that you know, great knowledge
[1:27:12] is up here. But I'll tell you, when
[1:27:14] people ask you a question, and brother
[1:27:17] Mario was with me, we were over in the
[1:27:19] Philippines. He said, "Brother Ron," he
[1:27:22] said, "any of these ministers come over
[1:27:24] and they have great big meetings and all
[1:27:26] the people in four or five days and and
[1:27:29] after the meeting is over, the minister
[1:27:31] leaves and goes to his motel and then
[1:27:33] comes from the motel back to the
[1:27:35] meeting." He said, "We never have a time
[1:27:37] of questions and answers." Yeah.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Ron, would you mind if
[1:27:43] we could just get all the ministers
[1:27:45] together and we we have a time of
[1:27:48] questions and answers?" And I tell you,
[1:27:51] I had I had caught a cold right at the
[1:27:53] end. It was the day we were leaving or
[1:27:56] the day before. And I man, my head was
[1:27:59] so stopped up, my nose and everything.
[1:28:02] And I said, "You'll have to put a
[1:28:03] Kleenex box at the at the pulpit." I
[1:28:05] said because you know I'm just my nose
[1:28:09] is running and I don't feel real good.
[1:28:10] But I said yes. So they got to all the
[1:28:12] ministers together and I tell you the
[1:28:15] real truth. Now here is what is always
[1:28:18] best and what I prefer is to get the
[1:28:21] questions a day or two ahead of time.
[1:28:23] You pray about it.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; You go look it up or something. But when
[1:28:27] listen this message if you don't know it
[1:28:29] and it's not in your heart,
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; you know I don't need a computer to go
[1:28:33] find it.
[1:28:35] Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I need the presence of God.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; It was so supernatural that while and
[1:28:41] they just gave the microphone. Okay,
[1:28:43] brother, what is your question? Stand
[1:28:45] up. You got a question? Yes. U brother
[1:28:47] Brennham, he said this and this and uh
[1:28:50] what did he you know and they'd ask some
[1:28:52] question. I'll tell you while they were
[1:28:54] asking the question, God's giving me the
[1:28:57] answer.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; I may not know the page and paragraph,
[1:29:00] but I'll tell you if I know it, I'm
[1:29:03] going to tell you. Yes, he said it.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; And here's what he said about it. I may
[1:29:07] paraphrase it, but it's there.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; And I remember brother Marcus Becker
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; when he he first came into the message,
[1:29:16] he heard me preach, he got so excited
[1:29:18] that I'd say, "Brother Brennham said."
[1:29:20] So he wrote it down. "Brother Ron said
[1:29:22] that, Brother Brennham said." So
[1:29:24] everywhere he went to preach after that,
[1:29:26] he'd say, "Brother Ron said that,
[1:29:27] Brother Brennham said." Till finally
[1:29:29] they said, "Who's brother Ron?
[1:29:33] Now, he gave me one of the best
[1:29:35] compliments, Brother Neil, that I ever
[1:29:38] gotten in my life.
[1:29:41] He said, "You said, Brother Brennham
[1:29:43] said it."
[1:29:47] And finally,
[1:29:49] we could look it up on computer. This
[1:29:51] was before the computer.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; This is before this, you know, folio
[1:29:56] views and the table and all that. He
[1:29:58] said, "But I wrote it down.
[1:30:03] And I found out that he said it.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Now, saints, why do you think I put a
[1:30:08] quote up here for you? You think I just
[1:30:10] want to read?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; I want to take you and show you this is
[1:30:16] what Elijah said.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Here's what the messenger said.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to to uh tickle your ear
[1:30:24] and bring some kind of new doctrine. I
[1:30:27] am here to put you in remembrance. Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; God, let me be a real true Timothy. It's
[1:30:33] not me. It's what Paul said.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; I'm sure they kept coming to Timothy.
[1:30:39] Why are you always saying Paul said Paul
[1:30:41] said?
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Well, he knew Paul was the messenger.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; And I know who is the messenger. It's
[1:30:49] not me.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; It's not some preacher.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:31:01] It's time to wean ourselves away from
[1:31:05] the sincere milk of the word
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; and get into some real good, strong
[1:31:10] meat.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 5 verses 12-4.
[1:31:22] For when for the time you ought to be
[1:31:25] teachers,
[1:31:27] you have need one to teach you again,
[1:31:29] which is the first principles of the
[1:31:31] oracles of God, and have become such as
[1:31:35] have need of milk, and not of strong
[1:31:38] meat. For everyone that uses milk is
[1:31:41] unskillful in a word of righteousness,
[1:31:44] for he is a babe.
[1:31:47] Now, don't make fun of him because he's
[1:31:49] a babe. Only make fun of him if he stays
[1:31:52] a babe.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Grow up.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Act your age, not your shoe size.
[1:32:09] How many how many
[1:32:13] ones within this message are so immature
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; about this message and about serving God
[1:32:21] in the way
[1:32:23] that even Paul said, "I serve God
[1:32:27] in the way that some men call heresy."
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] For strong meat belongth to them that
[1:32:38] are of full age,
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; even those who by reason of use
[1:32:46] it or lose it,
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; who by reason of use,
[1:32:54] have their senses exercised
[1:32:58] to discern both good and evil.
[1:33:01] We got nurses and different ones in the
[1:33:03] medical profession here. What happens to
[1:33:06] if you bro break your arm and it's put
[1:33:09] into a cast and it's immobilized for six
[1:33:12] or eight weeks and they take the cast
[1:33:14] off.
[1:33:16] What happens to the muscles?
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Atrophy.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; They're still there.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; When my son broke his arm and he was
[1:33:25] weeks in a cast and finally they took it
[1:33:27] off and the doctor said, "Straighten
[1:33:29] your arm." I can't. I can't.
[1:33:33] No. So,
[1:33:35] it hurts
[1:33:37] because by reason of use. How many of
[1:33:40] you your your faith muscles have
[1:33:42] atrophied? You haven't used faith.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; You use money.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; You use doctors.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; You don't need God to heal you anymore.
[1:33:52] You run to the doctor.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Used to be. used to be they brought the
[1:33:59] sick to church.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; God give us
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; disciples
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; that'll tear the roof apart
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; and let a man down before Jesus.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; There's power in the name.
[1:34:25] Yeah, I understand when you're sick and
[1:34:27] you you need to stay home. I understand.
[1:34:29] And I'm talking about
[1:34:32] it used to be that it was an institution
[1:34:35] of healing.
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Bring all the halt, the lame, the sick,
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; the blind, those that need help.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And they brought them to church.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:51] Now we take them to the hospital.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with hospitals. Nothing
[1:34:58] wrong with doctors. But sometimes I want
[1:35:00] you to understand the doctors can do all
[1:35:03] they can
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; and you're no better.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Like the woman who had an issue of blood
[1:35:09] and she spent all her life saving and
[1:35:12] she was no better.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; She heard about Jesus one day.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; There he was walking among the crowd.
[1:35:21] All of a sudden, Jesus stops.
[1:35:25] There's people thronging him,
[1:35:28] people calling out his name.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Have mercy.
[1:35:33] Oh, God.
[1:35:35] And he stops.
[1:35:39] Who touched me?
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Peter,
[1:35:43] what do you mean who touched you? Can't
[1:35:45] you see all these people are touching
[1:35:47] you?
[1:35:49] But I perceive
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; somebody in the congregation
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; had faith.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Somebody was pulling me.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody halted me.
[1:36:02] Somebody touched me. Why? I feel virtue
[1:36:04] has left me.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; I feel a part of the energy source
[1:36:10] within me
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; has gone to somebody and they needed a
[1:36:14] touch.
[1:36:16] They needed a jump.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Who touched me?
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; And when she felt she could no longer
[1:36:28] hide herself,
[1:36:30] she said, "It's me. I touched you."
[1:36:35] She never physically touched him, Bo.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; She never touched his skin. You know
[1:36:40] what she did?
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; The hem of his garment.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] his dressear.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know what brother Bram said? You
[1:36:53] know what God's dressear is today?
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; He said it's the ministry.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; That's why my brother, my sister, and I
[1:37:06] am not making myself anything.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; But I am called of God.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; I am called of God. I cannot run from
[1:37:15] it.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Though I have so many times.
[1:37:20] But my brother, my sister, if you will
[1:37:22] believe
[1:37:24] that God in his offices, if you respect
[1:37:27] the office of God,
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; God will respect you.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; And if you have need of something,
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; then you call for the elders.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; It's not the elders calling for you.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; No, you call for the elders.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have them lay hands on you and
[1:37:43] pray over you with oil and you shall be
[1:37:46] healed.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; There should be signs following the
[1:37:49] believers. We're not out here looking
[1:37:51] for signs. Signs follow.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; I expect signs to follow.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I am not
[1:38:04] boasting, but let me brag on him for a
[1:38:07] moment.
[1:38:09] There's been so many times supernatural
[1:38:11] signs have followed my ministry.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Unexplainable
[1:38:17] over in Africa
[1:38:19] they had, you know, and sometimes I'll
[1:38:22] have four and five translators
[1:38:24] and there was one little tribe of people
[1:38:26] that they had no one there that spoke
[1:38:29] English that could take their dialect
[1:38:31] and speak to the people.
[1:38:34] They couldn't speak whatever language it
[1:38:37] was. And while I was preaching and this
[1:38:42] group got so excited
[1:38:44] because they heard me speak in their
[1:38:47] dialect.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; I believe that
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; they heard me speak in their dialect.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; So after the service, they came over and
[1:38:57] they said, "When did you learn our
[1:39:00] language?"
[1:39:01] I said, "I don't know your language."
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; But I said, "He knows it."
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; And on the day of Pentecost,
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "It wasn't the
[1:39:12] changing of tongue,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; was a changing of ear."
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Because many of those people come and
[1:39:18] said, "How is it that we hear?
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; We hear the many wonderful works of God
[1:39:24] in the tongue wherein we were born,
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; me and
[1:39:30] Perlammites and
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; and yet these are Galileans.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Why is it that we can hear them in our
[1:39:39] own language?
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; God, there are so many supernatural
[1:39:44] signs that follow the gospel. It's not
[1:39:46] the man, it's him.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Another time somebody come so excited.
[1:39:56] Brother Ron, Brother Ron, I saw an
[1:39:58] angel.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; I saw an angel standing beside you
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; while you're preaching.
[1:40:05] I said, "Well, did it bless you?" They
[1:40:08] said, "Yes, yes." I said, "Then be
[1:40:10] blessed."
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; I didn't go and say, "Okay, uh, okay.
[1:40:14] What did it look like? Let's put here.
[1:40:16] Let me Yeah. Let's get it recorded and
[1:40:18] I'll put it in my newsletter and send it
[1:40:20] around." No.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Hey, now. Hey, I expect it.
[1:40:24] I expect God to do supernatural things.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I'm a fanatic. I am. I I don't mind
[1:40:37] letting you know that the Bible says who
[1:40:40] by use
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; of their senses exercise.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Use the discernment you got. Yeah.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Exercise
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; that you might know right from wrong,
[1:40:54] good from evil.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Don't just sit there listening.
[1:41:00] Use discernment.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Something on the inside. I tell you, you
[1:41:09] listen to some minister and he's
[1:41:12] teaching something that's a little bit
[1:41:14] odd. Something inside of you said, "That
[1:41:16] don't sound right."
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:18] My goodness, this got an uncertain
[1:41:21] sound.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; He may say, "Brother Brandham, set it,
[1:41:24] but I don't know. This is
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; it's got an awful uncertain sound. It's
[1:41:29] something inside of you, a little
[1:41:30] flashing red light. Be careful.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Be careful." That's why I've always said
[1:41:35] that, "Hey, the internet is just full of
[1:41:39] all kinds of ministers with all kinds of
[1:41:42] opinions and interpretations, and you
[1:41:45] got to follow me. And if you don't
[1:41:47] follow my ministry, you're not going to
[1:41:49] be in the bride and everything. Oh, I
[1:41:51] tell you, they come and go.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; But my brother, there's only, let me say
[1:41:57] this.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; There's only one prophet messenger
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; that was sent to this age. His name is
[1:42:03] William Marian Brandom.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; And it's his message
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; that is ordained of God to turn your
[1:42:10] hearts back.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; But I'm a part of the ministry under
[1:42:13] him. Because the brother Brennham said,
[1:42:15] "The final voice to the final age
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; under their messenger."
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; That's why. Say what he said.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Say what's on those tapes. Don't be
[1:42:28] afraid of it.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Get in there and eat it.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't exercise, you
[1:42:39] become unskillful.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Means inexperienced.
[1:42:45] ignorant.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; You don't know what to do.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I love to watch a man
[1:42:52] who is skilled in this trade. I do.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Because it it's it's fun to watch him.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Hey, he he grabs this tool. You know,
[1:43:05] you ever watch a a a guy that he's got
[1:43:07] the tools of the trade and he's got his
[1:43:09] tool belt and he's got his hammer and
[1:43:10] his and screwdriver and everything like
[1:43:12] that and he's there working on a job. He
[1:43:15] don't sit there and go, "Let me see. Uh,
[1:43:18] screwdriver. Where?
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Where's my hammer?
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; No, he he it could be dark.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; He's got the tools. He knows it's trade.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; I had a water system put in my house the
[1:43:39] other day. A kinetico. I'm not No, it's
[1:43:42] not an advertisement.
[1:43:45] And a guy's got all these filter
[1:43:47] systems. And he says, "Okay, in here and
[1:43:50] you you got to get under here and after
[1:43:52] so so many gallons and this thing's
[1:43:54] going to turn and you're going to lose
[1:43:55] the color and you have to put the new
[1:43:57] filter in there." I said, "Well, can I
[1:43:59] do that?" He said, "Yeah, you probably
[1:44:01] can, but it'll take you an hour and a
[1:44:02] half to two hours and can't." He said,
[1:44:04] "Call me up. It's 40 bucks." I couldn't
[1:44:07] throw 40 bucks fast enough. I don't have
[1:44:10] time to play around with this filter and
[1:44:12] take this here like that and then mess
[1:44:14] it up and then have to go to Home Depot
[1:44:16] and try to find the parts and fix it
[1:44:17] myself. Let the guys that know what they
[1:44:20] do know what they're doing.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Or do you guys all try to
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; fix your own car all the time? Huh? your
[1:44:29] carburetor's acting up or something.
[1:44:31] Used to be used to be.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Huh. That Hey,
[1:44:36] years ago, you could you could raise up
[1:44:38] the hood of the car. You could see the
[1:44:39] whole engine.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Nowadays, you raise you got it's
[1:44:44] covered.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; There's plastic all over it.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And a carburetor. How do I get to the
[1:44:51] What is the carburetor? Does it even
[1:44:52] have a carburetor?
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; No, it's fuel injected.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you go to tinking around next
[1:44:59] thing.
[1:45:01] [Music]
[1:45:03] Then you got to okay get a tow truck.
[1:45:06] Tow it in. The guy said, "What
[1:45:08] happened?"
[1:45:10] I don't know. It just quit. He said,
[1:45:11] "Looks to me like you've been fooling
[1:45:13] with it."
[1:45:14] It didn't just quit. No, you've been
[1:45:16] fooling with it. I tell you what, we
[1:45:18] ought to be using the tools that God
[1:45:20] gave us. Huh? Because not just sincere
[1:45:23] milk of the word, but start discerning.
[1:45:25] When you hear a sermon, when you hear a
[1:45:27] preaching, my you need to discern. And
[1:45:31] if there's something wrong, and I tell I
[1:45:34] tell people all the time, listen, if I
[1:45:36] say something and you don't fully
[1:45:37] understand it, you're free to ask me a
[1:45:39] question,
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stand behind. I tell
[1:45:42] you what, I'm God's man and you can't
[1:45:43] ask me. And if you do, you're out of
[1:45:45] here.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; It was so funny. I was preaching back
[1:45:52] east the other day
[1:45:54] and I said, you know, I was talking
[1:45:56] about I said, "Hey, you have a right.
[1:45:59] You have a right. You know, if the
[1:46:00] minister and if he's saying something,
[1:46:02] you have a right, go ask him where'd he
[1:46:03] say it. Where's that in the Bible?" I
[1:46:05] don't see it just exactly that way.
[1:46:08] Well, the the the host pastor said,
[1:46:09] "Brother Ron, you will never know who
[1:46:12] was just sitting in the congregation as
[1:46:14] he was preaching this because he throws
[1:46:16] everybody out of his church if you just
[1:46:19] if you even ask the question.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; You even question what he said.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Okay, you're out of here.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; You don't like that, huh? I'm God's man.
[1:46:37] use of authority over people. Huh?
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Like an umpire. You're out.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Unskillful.
[1:46:51] Nothing worse than somebody trying to
[1:46:53] fix it and they're inexperienced.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Huh.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; That's why on Mars Hill,
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Paul comes there and these people are
[1:47:02] worshiping the unknown God.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Right. And here they are worshiping the
[1:47:06] unknown god. Paul says, "Hey, you want
[1:47:11] me to tell you about the that unknown
[1:47:13] god? I know him."
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Here was an experience. You see,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; when you come in, it's not just
[1:47:20] preaching a sermon,
[1:47:22] but it's preaching a sermon that reveals
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; the unknown.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; That brings the answer of the question
[1:47:32] that you've been seeking.
[1:47:34] Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; In St. John 14, excuse me, 16:es 12-4.
[1:47:48] I have yet many things to say unto you,
[1:47:51] but you cannot bear them now.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; How be it, when he, the Spirit of truth,
[1:47:55] is come, he will guide you into all
[1:47:58] truth. Amen.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; It's a time delayed reaction.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; How many of you know that God delays his
[1:48:06] answers to you sometimes?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Destroy this temple in three days. I'll
[1:48:12] raise it up.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; They all thought he meant
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; the physical temple.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't until after the resurrection
[1:48:20] then they understood meant the temple of
[1:48:23] his body.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand
[1:48:28] that
[1:48:29] many times
[1:48:32] you cannot catch what you need to catch
[1:48:35] because you're not mature enough.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; You can't
[1:48:43] learn
[1:48:45] geometry until you've taken algebra,
[1:48:49] until you've taken basic math.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Because one leads to the other,
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:56] There's something about mathematics.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; It's kind of a mystery until you catch
[1:49:01] the formula.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Once you catch the formula, it's like,
[1:49:05] "Wow, it don't matter."
[1:49:08] Because you know the formula.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of truth has come, he
[1:49:19] will guide you into all truth.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; What does that mean?
[1:49:23] You need the Holy Spirit.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, we need the Holy
[1:49:28] Spirit in our lives more today than
[1:49:30] we've ever needed.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Because he's going to show you. Look,
[1:49:35] the Bible says he'll show you things to
[1:49:38] come. He shall glorify me for he shall
[1:49:41] receive a mine and shall show it unto
[1:49:43] you.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; St. John 4, Jesus had gone,
[1:49:56] went into town.
[1:50:03] Verse 30, then they went out into the
[1:50:05] city and came unto him. The meanwhile
[1:50:08] his disciples prayed to him, saying,
[1:50:11] Master, eat.
[1:50:13] And he said to them,
[1:50:17] "I have meat to eat
[1:50:20] that you know not of."
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; They asked him, "Lord, we went into the
[1:50:26] city here. Here's something to eat." He
[1:50:28] said, "I got something. I got meat that
[1:50:31] you don't know about."
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Therefore said the disciples one to
[1:50:35] another, "Hath any man brought him
[1:50:39] an Uber Eats?
[1:50:42] Did somebody bring him something and we
[1:50:44] didn't know it?
[1:50:46] And Jesus saith unto him, "My meat
[1:50:50] is to do the will of him that sent me
[1:50:53] and to finish his work."
[1:50:56] That's my meat.
[1:50:59] And that's your meat. To have God's word
[1:51:02] revealed to you so much
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; that you understand that's the will of
[1:51:06] God for you.
[1:51:15] Amen.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; That when you read your Bible
[1:51:20] and it begins to talk about a woman and
[1:51:22] her placing and a woman shouldn't cut
[1:51:24] her hair that's given to her for her
[1:51:27] glory. That's God's will.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; And when you understand God's will and
[1:51:33] it's revealed to you, it's your meat.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh,
[1:51:37] it's a it's a substance.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; it's a substance. I'm eating of
[1:51:43] something.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why people they look
[1:51:48] at us and they think we're legalistic
[1:51:51] because of the way we dress and we don't
[1:51:54] go do this and we're not out here
[1:51:56] socially drinking and all of this. No.
[1:51:59] No. I'm in love.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; I fell in love.
[1:52:05] I did. I I I I fell in love.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus said, "If you love me,
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; you keep my commandments."
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Show me somebody who does not keep his
[1:52:23] commandments.
[1:52:25] They don't love him.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; They talk about him.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; They honorth him with their lips, but
[1:52:31] their heart is far from him. That's
[1:52:33] right.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; In vain do they worship me, teaching for
[1:52:38] doctrine the commandments of men.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, and I'm speaking
[1:52:46] to us ministers,
[1:52:49] speaking to myself. God forbid that we
[1:52:52] make this message
[1:52:54] creeds and dogmas
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; and dos and don'ts
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; and legalists.
[1:53:01] No. Let me get you to where you fall in
[1:53:05] love with him.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think, and I've told you this
[1:53:10] before, one of the most wonderful quotes
[1:53:12] I ever heard, Brother Brand, and it was
[1:53:15] just the way he said it. He said,
[1:53:18] "Father,
[1:53:20] let your people love me."
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; That I can bring them to you.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Paul said,
[1:53:35] When it's all said and done,
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; when everything's
[1:53:40] I know one thing,
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; and it's Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; It's what it's all about. You know, the
[1:53:50] main theme of the Bible is Christ, the
[1:53:53] mystery of God revealed. Yes.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Do you know that the types and shadows
[1:53:58] all the way from Genesis to Revelation
[1:54:01] is understanding it is the Christ of
[1:54:04] God.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Who do they say that I the son of man
[1:54:12] am? Some said Jeremiah is one of the
[1:54:14] prophets. Peter, who do you say that I
[1:54:17] am?
[1:54:21] In one of the gospels, he said, "Thou
[1:54:23] art the Christ of God,
[1:54:26] he said, "Blessed art thou, Simon
[1:54:28] Barjonah, flesh and blood didn't reveal
[1:54:30] this to you,
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; but your father which is in heaven,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; and upon this rock I'll build my
[1:54:36] church."
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; I'm asking every one of you, check your
[1:54:41] life.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Are you in love with Jesus Christ?
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this messenger and I can't
[1:54:48] wait to hug his neck
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; honestly
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; and I will thank him for the hours of
[1:54:57] ministry and the sleepless nights and
[1:55:01] all of the the sweat and the toil and
[1:55:04] labor as a minister
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; to to take and preach sermons
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; and store up spiritual food in due
[1:55:13] season because you know what?
[1:55:16] Nearly every day I take that spiritual
[1:55:18] food up and I put it on and I listen
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; and it feeds me
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; and I say no man spake like this man.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; It's feeding my soul.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Not something up here and fancy this and
[1:55:35] that.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:55:44] Hebrews chapter 7.
[1:55:47] It's time this little church could take
[1:55:51] meat and no more the milk of the word.
[1:55:54] We've been too much in the milk now.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Giving the baby his bottle.
[1:56:01] We got to have strong meats for the day
[1:56:03] is getting close.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Great perilous times are at hand
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; and more trouble laying in the road.
[1:56:15] And we know
[1:56:17] there'll never
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; be better times.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; It's getting worse.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Darkness is getting worse.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; I can't promise you.
[1:56:34] Yeah. Don't don't don't think Trump's
[1:56:36] going to make it better. We're going to
[1:56:37] make America great again. Sorry.
[1:56:38] America's done.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:41] It's history.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; She has swn
[1:56:46] so much that she'll never
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; She's reeling like a drunk man.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; You ever seen a drunk man down the road?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; About ready to fall over
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; America. They have found out that the
[1:57:07] brother Ram said all politics is
[1:57:09] corrupt.
[1:57:10] It's all corrupt. Look at what they're
[1:57:12] finding out. That this ex-president, he
[1:57:15] did this and give away millions of
[1:57:16] dollars and they took millions and this
[1:57:18] and that and all this and Trump is
[1:57:21] trying to say, "Well, look at this guy.
[1:57:23] He stole this money and this and that."
[1:57:25] Well, it's all corrupt.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; You can't, you know, in Holland, you
[1:57:32] know, they got that that story of the
[1:57:34] little Dutch boy that put his finger in
[1:57:36] the dyke. Do you know when I went to
[1:57:38] Holland I asked I because they had got
[1:57:41] dikes everywhere. Holland it comes from
[1:57:44] Naland. Naland land from under
[1:57:48] Netherland.
[1:57:49] Naland. We took back the ocean. We made
[1:57:52] a dyke. We put windmills up there and we
[1:57:54] got all of the water out. So it's
[1:57:56] Naland.
[1:57:58] And I said, "Well, where is the dyke? We
[1:57:59] went through the these pl all these
[1:58:01] dikes and you go miles of and everything
[1:58:05] and and here's the sea on the other
[1:58:06] side." I said, "Well, the story of the
[1:58:08] boy with the finger in the dyke, the
[1:58:10] little Dutch boy." He said, "I've never
[1:58:12] heard it." I ask a lot of those the
[1:58:14] people from Holland, "What about the
[1:58:17] Dutch boy with a finger in the dyke?"
[1:58:19] Well, let me tell you,
[1:58:22] I feel like sometimes people are trying
[1:58:24] to put a finger
[1:58:26] in the dyke when the dam's breaking.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; It's gone. Right. Right.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; You can sit here and by the time you
[1:58:33] plug this one up, this one over here,
[1:58:34] and pretty soon you got to take your
[1:58:36] shoes off
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; trying to plug every hole, it's gone.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Don't ever put your money your faith in
[1:58:44] the money system.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Well, my retirement,
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; social security, I can't wait till I get
[1:58:51] 65 and I'll Hey, it may be gone.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; My hope is built on nothing less. Amen.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus Christ and his righteousness,
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; huh? My retirement
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; is out of this world.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going home.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going home.
[1:59:16] Amen.
[1:59:18] I got my ticket.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I got the token.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Have you got the token? musicians if you
[1:59:27] come.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Have you got the token?
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to take a trip on a good
[1:59:40] old gospel ship
[1:59:43] going far beyond the sky.
[1:59:47] The other day we took a cruise.
[1:59:50] It's kind of funny. You go up there and
[1:59:52] you say, "Hey, I I got a cabin on this
[1:59:55] cruise." And the people, they they look,
[1:59:58] they got a roster register with all the
[2:00:01] names. What' you say your name is again?
[2:00:06] You ain't on here. I said,
[2:00:09] "You you better look again."
[2:00:12] My wife's looking at me like, "Are you
[2:00:14] got the date right? Is it I said, "No, I
[2:00:17] I know for sure." Finally, I said, "Oh,
[2:00:19] yeah, yeah, yeah. I was looking in the
[2:00:21] wrong area. Okay.
[2:00:23] And we went to get off. They tell
[2:00:25] everybody if you are going to take your
[2:00:28] your bags and you want the people to
[2:00:30] take your bags the night before, put a
[2:00:33] little tag on it and they'll come
[2:00:35] collect your bags and then when you get
[2:00:37] off the ship, your bags will be waiting
[2:00:39] for you off the ship. Well, Sandy and I,
[2:00:42] we're going to take our bags with us.
[2:00:44] And they said, 'If you're if you're
[2:00:46] getting off by yourself with your own
[2:00:48] bags, keep your bags with you and
[2:00:50] everything and then you can go and you
[2:00:52] can get off. So, we get off and they
[2:00:55] tell us to go down and how to get off
[2:00:57] the ship and I've got an older lady.
[2:01:00] She's got a cane
[2:01:02] and she's got a little pulley trolley,
[2:01:05] you know, with a couple handbags
[2:01:08] and she comes up and the the the
[2:01:12] guy letting her to get off, he he said,
[2:01:14] "Uh, ma'am, you can't have somebody
[2:01:18] carry your baggage for you. You have to
[2:01:21] take it off yourself."
[2:01:26] But can't you see? I I need help. She's
[2:01:28] got a She's got a cane and she's kind of
[2:01:31] crippled up. She said, "I I need help
[2:01:34] getting off. Sorry, ma'am. Get out of
[2:01:38] line and stand right over here."
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Oh, God,
[2:01:44] don't let me come up to the time of let
[2:01:47] somebody else try to take my baggage."
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; If I'm going to get off, let me carry
[2:01:54] what I've got.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want somebody to stop me
[2:01:58] at the at the gate.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; That was so sad, was it not Sandy, to
[2:02:02] see an old lady.
[2:02:05] Sorry, ma'am. Stand aside.
[2:02:09] Oh my.
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:22] Amen.
[2:02:24] I'm done this morning.
[2:02:26] [Music]
[2:02:27] I don't need to go any further.
[2:02:33] You know what I need all of you to do?
[2:02:38] I need you
[2:02:40] to seek God in your prayer closet at
[2:02:43] home. Amen.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; I need you to ask God to give you
[2:02:48] something through this ministry
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; that while I'm up here, because I'll
[2:02:54] tell you, some of you,
[2:02:56] some of you go to pulling so hard,
[2:03:02] you pull the sermon out of me.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; It's you. It's not me. It's you. How
[2:03:13] about your faith?
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; How about you saying, "Oh, God, I need
[2:03:18] you to speak to me. Use Brother Ron's
[2:03:21] voice.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Speak to me. Give me an answer."
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; You need to pull it out of me.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Andreas Ringan, he's been here. He gave
[2:03:34] his testimony years ago. I'm I'm
[2:03:37] finishing with this.
[2:03:40] Been a few times in my life I've had a
[2:03:42] vision,
[2:03:43] an actual vision. I wasn't dreaming. I
[2:03:47] was wide awake. I saw it. I saw this
[2:03:49] vision. I I heard the sermon I'm
[2:03:51] preaching. I saw the the crowd. I saw
[2:03:53] the people. I saw these girls sitting on
[2:03:56] the front row. It was in a house meeting
[2:03:58] with and the place was packed with
[2:04:00] youth.
[2:04:03] I told my wife, I said, "I had a vision
[2:04:05] this morning." I said, "The Lord showed
[2:04:08] me. I heard what I was preaching on and
[2:04:10] everything.
[2:04:12] [Music]
[2:04:13] And
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:19] when I walked in that morning,
[2:04:23] you know what, Josh? I walked into the
[2:04:25] vision. I was in it.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; I I stepped into the vision. And it was
[2:04:32] so powerful because you know what? I'm
[2:04:34] in the vision here. Here, here I here's
[2:04:38] the girl sitting. Here's the people.
[2:04:40] Here's the setting. This is just like
[2:04:43] you showed me, Lord. And there was one
[2:04:45] young boy that was back about sitting
[2:04:48] about where you're at, Brother Roger.
[2:04:52] And
[2:04:53] I said, "Young man, stand up and say
[2:04:57] that you love the Lord."
[2:05:00] And these young girls are interested to
[2:05:02] see who I'm talking to. So they turned
[2:05:05] around and looked and they when they saw
[2:05:07] who I'm pointing to, he's the worst
[2:05:10] young boy in the group.
[2:05:13] He's the rebel.
[2:05:16] He's the elder son.
[2:05:20] He's been out carousing. He's
[2:05:22] everything.
[2:05:23] And the night before he came to the
[2:05:25] service, he got so moved of God
[2:05:30] that he went up into the hoft
[2:05:33] above where they feed the cows.
[2:05:36] Throw the fodder down to the cows. And
[2:05:39] he said,
[2:05:41] "God, I need to know. Is this real?"
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; I I have such a feeling. I don't want
[2:05:47] some emotion.
[2:05:49] I want reality. Amen.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; And I need to have a sign. I need you to
[2:05:54] give me a sign, God.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; I need you to have brother Ron call me
[2:06:01] out and say, "Stand up and say you love
[2:06:04] the Lord."
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; So, I said, "Stand up and say you love
[2:06:08] the Lord."
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; These girls look and they start laughing
[2:06:11] like, "Boy, did is your discernment off,
[2:06:14] pastor?
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Minister, did you ever blow it?" Because
[2:06:18] this is the worst guy in the group. And
[2:06:19] all the young people knew it.
[2:06:22] And brother Andreas, the Holy Spirit
[2:06:24] come over him and he starts crying. Now
[2:06:27] everybody shuts up. Nobody's laughing
[2:06:30] now. All of a sudden he said, "Oh," he
[2:06:34] said, "God dealt with me last night and
[2:06:35] I asked God for a sign.
[2:06:43] He received his son. Now he's a pastor.
[2:06:47] Now he's a minister.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; This is what you need to do. Get in your
[2:06:54] prayer closet. Ask God.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Ask God if you love me. Give me a sign.
[2:07:02] [Music]
[2:07:04] God said, "Put me to the test. Is my arm
[2:07:06] too short?
[2:07:09] Do I not hear your prayer?
[2:07:14] [Music]
[2:07:16] I want all of you
[2:07:19] to pull the sermon
[2:07:21] when I get into a channel and God is
[2:07:25] anointing and you know it's not me. My
[2:07:28] twin brother told me something and he's
[2:07:30] my twin brother.
[2:07:33] He's my wombmate.
[2:07:37] We know one another
[2:07:40] and my brother doesn't agree in
[2:07:42] different things.
[2:07:46] He said, "When I go to your church and I
[2:07:49] watch you preach,"
[2:07:51] he said, "I see when it's no longer my
[2:07:55] brother."
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "Rav, I see you change.
[2:08:02] I see God anointing the gift.
[2:08:06] [Music]
[2:08:14] Brother Brennham said, "You think it's
[2:08:16] me that operates this gift?"
[2:08:20] He said, "It's you."
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's you, your faith. You're
[2:08:25] reaching out."
[2:08:28] He said, "It's you causing it."
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Some of you have come to me after a
[2:08:33] service and said, "Brother Ron, that was
[2:08:35] exactly what I needed.
[2:08:37] It was so much what I needed. You were
[2:08:40] speaking directly to me.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Who told you?
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Nobody told me.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; What it was is God. All of a sudden,
[2:08:50] God's using my voice. He's speaking to
[2:08:52] you.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; It'll happen, my brother, my sister,
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; if you'll have faith in God.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:06] How many of you would like a
[2:09:09] a touch from God?
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:13] [Music]
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about some kind of
[2:09:18] little some
[2:09:20] flash in the pan that tomorrow it's
[2:09:22] gone.
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; But I need a change.
[2:09:35] I need the Holy Spirit
[2:09:38] to move in my life.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; I see a couple people standing. Is there
[2:09:48] anybody else that says,
[2:09:50] "I want to reach out.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; I want to reach out.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Don't stand up unless you mean it."
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:03] [Music]
[2:10:07] If my people
[2:10:09] who are called by my name,
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; if they will pray, will they not hear
[2:10:14] from God?
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; That's his word.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; That's not me. That's him.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; If you'll take God at his word,
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; you want God to touch you and take you
[2:10:28] higher.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:32] All you got to do is ask.
[2:10:35] Asking.
[2:10:38] And when you have that faith inside of
[2:10:40] you, have faith to believe.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; I'm asking.
[2:10:46] And I'm believing you're going to take
[2:10:48] me higher.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm kind of
[2:10:56] homesick for a country.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Mark, would you help me on
[2:11:00] that?
[2:11:01] I'm kind
[2:11:04] of homesick.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm longing
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; for
[2:11:11] a country
[2:11:16] to which I
[2:11:19] [Applause]
[2:11:23] never been before.
[2:11:27] Oh,
[2:11:31] no. Sad
[2:11:33] goodbye.
[2:11:38] Will there be spoken?
[2:11:45] And time won't matter
[2:11:54] anymore.
[2:11:56] Oh,
[2:12:00] you love the lamb.
[2:12:04] [Music]
[2:12:07] I'm longing
[2:12:09] for
[2:12:11] you.
[2:12:15] And someday
[2:12:17] [Applause]
[2:12:21] only
[2:12:23] I'll stand
[2:12:25] [Music]
[2:12:29] there. My hope
[2:12:35] shall be eternal.
[2:12:38] [Music]
[2:12:44] You
[2:12:45] lamb,
[2:12:50] sweet
[2:12:53] land.

[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; I'm looking
[2:13:00] now.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Across that river.
[2:13:05] across
[2:13:07] that river
[2:13:12] to where my faith
[2:13:19] will end inside.
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:26] There's just a few more
[2:13:34] days to labor.
[2:13:41] Then I will take
[2:13:48] my heavenly
[2:13:50] life.
[2:13:52] [Music]
[2:13:55] for you.
[2:13:59] [Music]
[2:14:01] I'm longing for
[2:14:06] you.
[2:14:10] And someday
[2:14:13] [Music]
[2:14:16] on me I stand.
[2:14:24] There my home
[2:14:30] shall be
[2:14:32] eternal
[2:14:33] [Applause]

[2:14:44] sweet.
[2:14:47] Sing the chorus again.

[2:22:21] Lord, I surrender my life.

[2:22:49] Lord, I surrender my life.
[2:22:56] I give it all to you.
[2:23:06] For this promise is given unto you
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; and to your children
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; and to your children's children,
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; even as many as the Lord our God shall
[2:23:21] call.
[2:23:24] Do any of you have a loved one,
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; a relative, a son, a daughter,
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; somebody who's not where they should be?
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; And you'd like to raise your hand.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; You'd like to stand in the gap. That's
[2:23:39] what Hattie Wright did.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; You know what she did? She became an
[2:23:43] intercessor
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; right at that moment.
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham, that's nothing but the
[2:23:51] truth. That's right.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; What do you want?
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; I want my family.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you. You want your family?
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Ask for them.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible says where two or more
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; will bind here on earth. I'll bind to
[2:24:06] heaven.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; I want my family.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; I want my kids.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; I want my grandkids.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go without them.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm asking God, may there be a real
[2:24:19] surge, a move. Bring the prodigals in.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Bring them in, Lord.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; The hour's late.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; The door's almost closed. It's almost
[2:24:30] over. Father God, we all We're raising
[2:24:33] our hands right now. We're saying, God,
[2:24:35] bring them in.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; We can't do it.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; We've exhausted all our resources.
