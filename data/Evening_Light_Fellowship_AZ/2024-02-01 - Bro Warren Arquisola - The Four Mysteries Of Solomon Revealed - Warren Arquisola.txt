let's open our Bibles Proverbs chapter chapter 3 or Chapter 30 Verse 18 to 19 there be three things which are too wonderful for me yay for which I know not or there are three things which are too wonderful for me yay four which I know not the way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon on a rock the way of a sheep in the midst of the Sea and the way of a man with a maid let's bow our heads father I ask you Lord to come down tonight yes and speak to my lips father we don't know how to open the Bible oh God but you came down with an open book and you showed us from Genesis to Revelation that it is you walking into your church Lord Jesus bless your people tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you can you may be seated thank you brother Ron for the opportunity that you allowed me to speak behind uh this pulpit I know we have the Revelation that this church is nothing without God but if God is here then this is a holy church amen there's nothing in this Pulpit it's just a wood but if God is here this is a holy Pulpit maybe I'm not pronouncing it right like the prophet said he don't even know what is how to pronounce pulpit and ppit but he said he knows the author of The Bible Hallelujah God bless you brother s uh good to see you and uh so I will the title of this message the mystery of Solomon revealed brother Mario was preaching about the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed so I was thinking about this scripture and uh I was like telling to Brother Martin I will preach this to to our church amen I thank the Lord God granted my Visa to Pakistan so Lord willing I bought a ticket last night and I will go this coming March till the 30th or March 18th till 30th amen so from now on uh remember me in your prayers when when I decided to go to Pakistan brother calib from from uh New Zealand contacted me he he was telling me about the there are 4,000 Believers in Pakistan and he said I want you brother Warren to go to Karachi and then brother mustak from Islamabad contacted me he said brother Warren I want you to come here in Islamabad because there was no missionaries going to Pakistan and they're so thirsty to see a missionary and I said this is my opportunity amen but I will go to lur Pakistan so if you go to the map Islamabad is on the North uh area carachi is in the uh Southeast area and um lur is in the southwest area so I will go to lur Pakistan amen now Solomon God made him a king and then this was his prayers in first king 3: 6 he said and Solomon said thou Hast showed unto thy servant David my father great Mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou Hast keep for him the great kindness that thou Hast given me given him a son to sit on his throne and it uh and as it this and now oh Lord thy God thou Hast made thy servant King instead of David my father and I am but a little child according to the history Solomon was about 12 years old this time and I know not how to go out or come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy of thy uh people which thou Hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor are counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding our and the understanding hard to judge thy people am that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great people a 12-year-old kid going to the White House but because of his prayers God was pleased he did not ask for soldiers for for for uh uh money and wealth he asked for wisdom to rule the people of God and because of that right mental attitude because of that right prayers God not only giving him wisdom but God gave him uh granted him riches and Glory that his name people will know from the uttermost part of the earth right and here was the the the the uh God and this speech pleased the Lord th that Solomon had asked this thing and God said said unto him because thou Hast asked this thing and Hast not asked for thy self long life neither has asked riches for thyself nor has asked for the life of thine enemies but has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold I have done Accord according to thy words lo I have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee and I have also given thee that which thou Hast not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be any am among the Kings like unto thee all thy all thy days and in and and if thou Hast walked in my ways to keep my statutes and my Commandments as thy father David did walk then I will lengthen thy days and Solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and offered up burnt offering or offerings and offered peace offerings and made Feast to all his servants I was listening to to the uh sometimes you know you you're you're not doing anything you scroll look for a h a a a little bit of wisdom from from the from the rabbis or Scholars and I was s watching this YouTube and this Rabbi was explaining when Solomon asked for wisdom God gave him a wisdom an extraordinary wisdom amen that this kind of wisdom when he woke up he can hear the birds talking he understood what they're saying and it's the same thing when I I I went to Sab Sabino Canyon last Monday and I saw a rabbi over there Rabbi means teacher and I I asked him about the things that I heard and he said yes because he said even the the the trees has language even the insects has language so everything that you tell you're asking me is true and I was said at least two or three that gathers in thy name right God confirmed that the rabbi was telling was true so now I said I will at least I will share that a little bit so even the insects even the trees that the wave was you know the trees was moving if the if the wind blows Solomon understood it but he was thinking maybe that there was no um uh how do you call this uh there was no no uh depression on the trees because you know why because they did not fall we fell right man fell yes so so that's why the animals are happy we we always struggle but God gave Solomon a wisdom that nobody can understand him so now Solomon there was a story about this woman uh two prostitute woman women that when this two delivered a a a child or a baby or babies one woman overlaid her son and she died and and and and and the baby died so now she really want to have a baby so what she did she went to another room and took the other baby and it's not hers but then when the the The Other Woman woke up she found out that the baby was dead so she said this is not my baby you know I I I really I was thinking about the the the nature of the mother that she can discern her own babies as always brother Robert say you may forget your son and your daughter's name but God always knew you before the foundation of the world because God engraved your name in in in her own Palm hallelujah amen thank you and this woman when she saw she she said this is not my baby so she went to the council and then the council was not really uh uh cannot cannot resolve because they doesn't have a wisdom and then this woman went to the higher Court to King Solomon right on and when King Solomon was listening to them and they cannot really resolve the problem he said said give me my sword I will cut this baby in half and I will give to two of you but here was the mother the real mother yes she said no my Lord I'd rather give my baby to her I don't want her to die but the other woman said it's it's it's even yes give the H and I I I'll get the h and Solomon said the real mother is here give that baby to her and then when the the the the Fox News delivered that news CNN you know what happened there's so many people from the Philippines from Africa from Nicaragua from Pakistan heard the good news yes amen am and and what they did they want to see they want to visit him that's why the prophet was preaching I I was heard but now I see I heard this before yeah but I really want to see that's why I went to Sabino Canyon last week amen and you know what happened there was a woman from sha the queen of shivba heard this message yeah and then this this uh queen of Shiva uh first king chapter 4:29 Oh no just a second um uh let's go back let's go back to first king 4:29 I really want to jump ahead and God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largess of heart even as the sand that is on the seashore and Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East Country and all the wisdom of Egypt for he was wiser than old man than Einstein or Ethan the Israelite and her man and chol and dard the sons of mahul and his Fame was in all Nation round about and he spake 3,000 proverbs and his songs were a th5 and he spake of trees that's the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even into the hisop that spring it out of the wall Solomon was the best scientist he was a zoologist he was a botanist studying trees and lives he was a biologist and then here's the queen of shba and when the queen of shba had seen all Solomon's wisdom because she cannot wait to see Solomon she you know sometimes that's what the believer wants you know I I I I want to see I I don't really want to hear these things if I am if this is my uh either e uh life or death I want to see it I want to just uh you know just to see people are rejoicing and I'm not doing anything I want to see by myself I want to experience by myself and then here's the queen of Shiva and he uh meet of his table uh and when the Queen of Sheba has seen all Solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built and the meat of his table and his setting of his servant she's watching and the attendance of his ministries yeah brother martin Warner is here he wants to see what's this congregation why they're so happy why I heard this from Canada but now I need to come here and the the and the uh even she was watching even the tables yeah and his ministers and their apparels they're watching their the the sisters and his cupbearers yeah and his asent by which he went up into the house of the Lord there was no more spirit in her she was sold out I I I I believe this amen this is it I I I'm so excited and she said to the king it was a true report that I heard in my own uh uh I heard in my own land of thy acts and of my wisdom of thy wisdom how be it I believe not the words until I came and my eyes had seen it and behold the Hat was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceeded the fame which I heard yeah amen and here she asked her guards her unics and she said gave 120 talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there come no more such abundance of spices as this which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon and you know how much is 120 talents of gold £99,000 worth three or worth three almost $300 million of today that's was a gift only because she was sold out to Solomon to the message that she heard and here in Matthew chapter 12 42 and uh to 43 the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment yes which with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost part of the earth just to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold greater than Solomon is here amen amen amen yes amen listen to the wisdom because of the wisdom of Solomon she heard this and she doesn't care about the danger she didn't even think about the son of Ismael that will come and Rob her and killed her and destroy all the cariban but because she was so out she doesn't care about her her life come on because I want to see and the the Bible said greater than Solomon is here sometimes here's the problem you heard this great message of the hour but you cannot even come on Wednesday night you cannot even come on Sunday but you're not far from the church you know how many months she traveled to see the to see Solomon three months I just put it here that God help us amen when I heard this message I had no gold in my pocket that's what Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but I can just give this stin body as a Living Sacrifice and when I was convinced to this message I I don't want to be just a church member I want to do something I want to give all my life to God even the ANS of my fiber in my body I need to give it to him amen because I am so to this message I am sold out to this messagen because if the if the if the queen of shba heard this message and she traveled for three months greater than the queen of Shiva is here I believe greater than the queen of sha is you because you heard this message message better than the message of Solomon how many of you I I don't really this is personal but how many of you are struggling the brother last week was talking to me he said I have a daughter and my daughter she told me Daddy just go to church with uh with Mom but I'm staying here because I'm doing my homework and when they come back or the the mom was something in her heart was something cannot explain but she said I need to go back I need to go home something wrong with my with our daughter and when she came back they came back she had she left a note that she said I don't want to live a hypocrite life I I I you uh if you don't look for me and that's what I uh it touched my heart because she's not the only one suffering maybe some of you sitting here the same question with that little lady I don't want to live a a a um hypocrite life see brothers and sisters I told the the the mom and dad just accept her just love her she will come back because you have a promise that you and your family will save will be saved just accept her just let her go but don't always remember give her something that if you if you need me we're here we're open the house is open amen amen some of you have a spir uh you're you're you're not sick in your physical body but maybe you're sick in spiritual I always advise especially young men brothers go with me to the mission field one day and you will come back and you will maybe scream and be happy and say I am the most blessed man in the world you see the people over there outside of this country they're hungry they doesn't have food in their table but they're fighting yes amen they they they they enjoy this message because what else we don't have food and then we we have a poor spiritually no we don't want to be poor we want to we want to be rich in spiritual amen amen church thank you for sending me thank you I was counting the 2023 it was 25 Souls got baptized and I'm praying 2024 more souls than 2023 until we see the last one amen the prophet message uh message of the Prophet The Queen of Sheba he said now with all this gold she had to travel mark on your map from Jerusalem down to shivba I I tra uh taken three months to make the trip not in an air conditioned Cadillac or in a couch or coach or in an airplane but on the back of the camel of a camel no wonder Jesus said she'll stand in the days of judgment and condemn this generation someone come across the street to hear it it see a gift of God they they turn their nose up at the and up at and and walk away now another thing is she had all the riches she's simply a prey to the children of is Ismael who were rubbers on the desert in these days this Fleet footed horses that they fall on her little Caravan there's and murder her and it would be uh take everything she had all these gos and things but you know there's something about it when you want to meet God and there's nothing will stand in your way you're going or on anyhow you build to the dangers you build to the criticisms you build to everything else God is your only motive and you're going to find him hallelujah what a message he is our only motive Hallelujah that's it and we will going to find him amen amen I was thinking about this this uh earthquakes and tsunamis and I was studying this morning I I I found this message of the prophet in marriage and divorce he said you know one man come out from his position one one stars from the galaxies come out to move just a little bit it affects the Earth there's a big tidle way and tsunamis and and and earthquakes because of one little star move out of his position and I was thinking about the Sons and Daughters of God Amen you move out from your position it will affect your household it will affect your spiritual [Applause] life just stay in your position as the Sons and Daughters of God Amen Solomon as I was reading this full of wisdom God gave him the the the the the wisdom that that man cannot have but there was a question in his mind four four mysteries in my mind I I can I I can understand the the birds I can understand I have wisdom to Rule the Kingdom but one day he was sitting in his throne and he was thinking why God cannot reveal this mystery to me the mystery of an eagle The Mystery of the serpent upon a rock the mystery of the sheep in the midst of the ocean and the man with a maid and I thank God from this message Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound begin to sound all the mysteries from Genesis to Revelation it's finished amen and he Malachi chapter 4 will restore all things and I I was when when Solomon was it was mystery to him but when I opened my eyes I I I I told brother Ron you can read this uh um you know uh Proverbs Chapter 30 you will see a different angle brother Stephen will see different angle all the ministers here brother James but to me I will share a little bit it said here when when I first heard this message in 1996 brother we buy Eagle hat we buy Eagle shirt and then the missionary from America they come with a built buckles Eagles Eagle thigh oh yeah right hat and then we don't need we don't brother we don't need uh any preaching about the message what we do is tell me about brother brandham because we're new in the message tell us oh and then the brothers 1996 brother brother R I'm sorry but that year it's to me it doesn't have a message they will tell you about buil buckles about brother Branham and that's what we want because we don't know brother bham right and he was a prophet he went to the Sabino Canyon the sword came down but then here's we want to see Eagles if you're an eagle I one day I I went to the uh north of the Philippines to to go to the convention and I cannot find the I cannot find the church and what I did I shout Like an Eagle because in my mind if ice cream Like an Eagle they will they will hear it I was when I read the story of an eagle you know the story of an eagle you know the you you always hear this the farmer saw an egg and he he put the the egg to the chicken uh Nest or the chicken uh how do you call that joined with a chicken eggs and all of them the same hatch together but this Eagle something wrong with him he's bigger he cannot really know how to scratch the food and once she find this the eagle find a a worm he cannot swallow that something in in in his stomach that cannot eat the food that the chickens eat and then this he always he always recognized something something wrong because the mama Eagle gathered all the time her cheeks and they they don't want him to the to they don't want him to join with them but you know what's the message what's the meeting all about please tell Junior Eagle that he is not an eagle tell him that he's a chicken all the time always tell him you're a chicken brother you're my my precious brother but you are a chicken you're not something else and he they always tell that to him because you know why the mama Eagle had a revelation that if the eagle know who he is the eagle will eat the chickens right that's what the mama Eagle wants to tell to the children don't let him know his position because we our lives is in danger and Solomon cannot understand that because it's not in his time his time just to hard to Rule the Kingdom but God gave us a revelation that you need to go up higher all the time don't stay in this world there's nothing in here beautiful serpent upon a rock that's the correct time over there okay serpent upon on the Rock You Know serpent is a cursed and I was thinking I was about about this uh about the book of numbers when when when Moses was in the wilderness Jesus was in the wilderness he was following all the time in your in in your brothers think about this yeah and if you're down he's there if you're up he's always there because He follows his people amen am when Joseph when he was in prison he was there when Jesus when when Joseph was in the pit he was there when Joseph was in the throne he was there he's always here all the time thank you I will never leave you nor forsake you I'm I will be with you all the time brother uh Billy he gave me a an idea he said tell to the Pakistani Brothers if we can have a youth camp and you know what that Pakistani brother was so happy that he broke out in tears he said brother I will tell you the message came here in 1972 but we don't know about Youth Camp and this Youth Camp is our first Youth Camp please don't tell me you will cancel it I said brother I will not we will have a youth camp thank you brother Billy for give me an idea because he's supposed to be the preachers over there so now but then when sin came in that rock became a serpent that rock became a cursed and that rock Moses was ordered to put that serpent on the breast the pool of brass and meaning to say the sin is already judged amen and all the people that was beaten by the snakes if they look up on that serpent look and live my brothers live look to Jesus Christ and live don't let me sing Philippino look and leave because he is the one the only one to look amen the prophet said here in John chapter 3 or the Bible said here and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man lip it up my from from the Bible That's why when when the two men from emus was screaming was crying because they crucified their lord they were kicking rocks they were they they don't know what to do but then here was the god came and say don't you know all the prophets the the writers was writing about me and you cannot open your ey you cannot you cannot understand the scriptures amen and now it's it's the same thing here in the message when the seventh late later later the ship in the midst of the Sea and the anchor uh the the ship the anchor is a symbol of safety and hope and security but now when the sea is blowing this is the message of the Prophet Joseph meeting his Brethren he said when the sea is blowing and stormy did you ever guess maybe some of you has never been privileged to see a ship anchored oh my I've BR them when they throw out a sea anchor like that until the little craft couldn't even go over to the top the wave it would go through the wave but as long as the anchor healed that that's all that makes any difference whether you go over it under it around it or around it or through it doesn't matter The Anchor Holds that's the way when the when storm of Life begin to shake us when when may have to go through we may have to go over under around but just let that anchor hold within the veil Amen to the Unseen when we don't even just exactly where it um am I right where it's but it's holding just like a little boy you you know that the had a kite you heard the old Proverbs the story said how do you know you got uh you got a kite on the end of thee said I can still feel it tagging see you you you maybe you don't know maybe you're you're thinking by yourself that no one is with you but as I said Jesus is always there all the time thank you how do you know it I feel the tag I feel the tag in my heart you know I was think thinking about the story of brother brandham he said uh when he was tired he cannot sleep he went to his office and then when he went to his office little Rebecca was coming with pajamas and and Rebecca hug him and then he hug him and and you know he want he missed the daddy Daddy's always out all the time and then here was Sarah when Sarah was coming she said Sarah I got all of daddy now you cannot come here anymore and brother brandham was was putting his foot a little bit and then Sarah came on the left leg and then brother Branham LIF her up a little bit and then Sarah said Rebecca I need to tell you I will tell you something maybe you got all of daddy but Dad is holding me and that is the word of God maybe the world or maybe you are in this in this uh uh you're thinking that you can hold hold on to him but no God is holding you amen thank you Lord you you know because if you're holding him there will be a time that you will slip away but if God is holding you my precious brother my precious sister you may be in the deep trouble you may be in the Deep trials but God is holding you he will not get you know there was a song a master of the wind he may bring you low but he will never what is that continue brother H he will never bring you down amen amen the one the woman or the man with the maid there was a story one time this story was this man there's this family at 11:00 they had a the house was burning so all the family got out from the house but then they were thinking one of the daughter was out but they found out the daughter was missing she was on the second floor and this this this the father was screaming the the the the the fire was consuming the whole house but he was screaming somebody can help my daughter was uh is on the second floor but this young man run inside the house he heard the the voice and he run inside the house and went to the second floor and took that girl and brought him down or brought her down but coming down all the on the way he was burned and has big scars in his face and he brought the daughter safely but then they brought him to the hospital years and years passed this man this woman she was uh uh about 20 years old now she said Daddy I want to make married that man that saved me and the dad said because he knew that man was ugly I I cannot accept him as my son-in-law so but he said oh my daughter maybe maybe he for he forgot you already um I I will uh bring you my coworker she said no brother uh Daddy every time he go to the mirror and he will see his cars he will not going to forget me amen every time he sees his cars he will remember me and this woman married this man and you know what happened the people mocked mock her because she was a beautiful woman but if she goes to Walmart with her husband they laugh at him they mock at him and you know what one day she pulled that that mockers and told or told her she said don't you know I will tell you a little bit of story why I am beautiful and my husband is ugly she said one day day there was a burn in the house and he saved me and that face that scar was the the scar because of fire and I am beautiful because of him and that people that mocking her was silent can you put that in the scripture amen he was wounded because of you thank you Lord he was bruised because of our iniquities we become beautiful amen I want to be humble brother Robert I become handsome because of him that's right can you see that am and now the message said the message said if you re if you see the the explan explation of the four Mysteries you can see it's all Jesus Christ all the way why Solomon cannot understand that because he did not see the Lord he had an idea that one day he will be the son of David and Jesus is the son of David why he had so many wives why he had thousand wives because one day the Bride of Jesus Christ is a many membered body the prophet said here in the message this is the rising of the sun it is the rising of the sun 1965 he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ amen and Christ is the seals that was open that is the opening of seals then revealing what is the opening of the seals revealing Jesus Christ when there was a silent in heaven for half an hour can you feel this this sequence of events even the ministers here in the message AG still believes that brother brandham is not Revelation 10:7 there's so many ministers preaching this message don't say that the opening of the seal is opened maybe they did not read us the rising of the Sun come on but when there was a half hour of Silence in heaven he came down and there was no Angels was singing it was silence for half an hour but then when he came down he came down with an open book in his hands amen that's why when when when the prophet was preaching about the Seven Seals he did not really reveal the seals he was silent it was silent but then when he preached the Crist is the mystery of God revealed he revealed Jesus Christ the power from the father gave all to the Son and the power from the son gave all to the church see the position my brothers and sisters of the Believers that the the Christ the the the Christ right now is in you that's right that's right right that's why there's so many clanes in the message when I call the brother that I'm going to the p pistan everybody was telling against this brother was telling against this brother I said brother I will tell you something bride cannot persecute bride how can I say I don't like this toenails or toes not toenails I cut my two Nails all the time amen the prophet said in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he is the principal them of the Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's his historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and there you are find Christ or if you find Christ he was in the prophets he he was in the Psalms he was in history he also in the Bible is the things that is to come so he was before until after what does it that make him make make him then the same yesterday today and forever he is the alpha the in between and the Omega he is him all the way I think I I will start preaching now now remember when the prophet was revealing this message he said the Elohim that self-existing one became the all existing one because the Elohim created Jehovah created Elohim Now what is eloh Elohim means god with his people or or Jehovah means god with his children god with his people it's a family in his mind I want to be a Healer I want to be a father I want to be a teacher I want to be a leader amen amen he wants to be a husband he is the one from the book of Psalms from the history to the Bible the prophet said here he said is Isaiah wrote 6 66 books of the Bible he said I see Isaiah said I see a counselor a prince of peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father that's what Isaiah look away and saw and Daniel when he was uh in the in the in the um uh in the uh Kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar he said one time I was standing and I saw the ending of gen Gentile dispensation I saw the image that NE nzar had dreamed I saw how each one would suc succeed the other and they come down and they look and see that wasn't going to happen to the end he saw Jesus was a stone hued out of the mountain without hands that crushed the Gentile kingdoms and Nebuchadnezzar and and when he put the children of Israel to the fiery furnace he said but when he looked away and saw Jesus he was the the forth man that was in the fiery furnace and did keep all the heat of his obedient servants that's what Nebuchadnezzar saw and Ezekiel Saw the Wheel in the middle of the wheel it was Jesus Christ amen it was Jesus Christ in the Book of Revelation it was Jesus Christ in the Book of James amen he is our healer amen he is Jesus Christ in the Book of Revelation he is the soon and coming King he is the king of kings and the Lord of lords that's right Jesus Christ all the time I pulled out this from the internet I still have time five more minutes in Genesis he is the Ram at Abraham's altar Jesus Christ in Exodus he's the Passover Lamb in Leviticus he's the high priest in numbers he's the cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night in Deuteronomy he's the city of our refuge in Joshua he's the Scarlet tread out of rahab's window in judges he is the judge in Ruth he is our Kingsman Redeemer in first and second Samuel he's trusted prophet and in Kings and Chronicles he's our reigning King in Ezra he is our faithful Sac faithful scribes in Nehemiah he is our Rebuilder of everything that is broken and in Esther he is the Mori sitting faithful at the gate in job he is is My Redeemer liveth in Psalms he is my shepherd and I shall not want in Proverbs and eclesiastes he is our wisdom amen it's Jesus all the way amen and the songs of Solomon he is the faithful bridegroom and in Isaiah he's the suffering servant in Jeremiah and lamentation he's a weeping prophet amen now from Genesis to Revelation because I don't have a time the prophet said here the true church it's Jesus Christ all the time the prophet said in the book in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said if you cannot see Jesus Christ in the page of your Bible go back you're missing something amen if you cannot see Jesus Christ go back maybe you're missing something you miss the author of this book and where Jesus is the bride is always with him my the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness remember her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest where is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without Hallelujah from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect Hallelujah please don't tell me I have spot un wrinkles I am perfect and sinless in fact in her is uh sumed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God greater than Solomon is here greater the queen of Shiva is here amen because God revealed the word opened it to your eyes to your Naked Eyes there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from the beginning to the ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her oh I read it twice wisdom and purpose of God how can one faom it how can Brothers to the harbard people this is foolishness but to me it's dous dous this is power to me but not only is the Candlestick of gold it is a beaten gold handcraft Ed and beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit-given outside of her Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of Christ surely she is failing up the suffering that Christ left behind her goods are despoiled her life is jardy is in jardy she is accounted as a sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day all the day long she suffered much but in it or re retaliate not but in it all retaliate not neither does she cause other to suffer woo and as gold is mumbled where us brass will break with the beating the gold of God will bear her suffering for the Lord but listen not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and joy Forward Forever by the trials and testing of this praise the Lord beaten but not destroyed down but will not going to bow down that's why when when when John when when John saw her she said she said and in the midst of the seven Candlestick like unto the son of man cloth with garment down to the foot and girth about the paps with a golden girdle and then John he said he looked like unto the son of man but the prophet said she has a breath it's the bride walking with the groom am my brothers it's always you all the way how do I know that I was there because you're manifesting him here you are troubled but you're still here in the church brothers because greater than Solomon is here greater than Rebecca is here yes greater than you brother is here see everyone of us if the B the Bible said

woman was with the policeman she was spending her her worldly things she was with the other man and brother renham saw and he was ready to condemn her oh I don't want to see Sarah and Rebecca to see this woman but then there was a vision it is not you who makes her righteous it is not you to put him because they will praise you if you're the one pushing it but if it's God leave her alone she's under the blood hallelujah amen leave her alone just apply the word just tell her about the word don't condemn her and this Prophet said don't you know I am William Branham a preacher and she told her story you never know why there's a prostitute you never know why there's a drunkard maybe there's some something behind that all of us have scars when I accepted the Lord I have earrings like brother
