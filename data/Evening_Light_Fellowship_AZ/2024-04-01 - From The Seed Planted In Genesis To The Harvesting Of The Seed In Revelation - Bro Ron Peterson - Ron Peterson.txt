today hallelujah hallelujah good morning I was thinking about the words of this song and I was told a story one time that they searched all over the world to find the uh the greatest scholar of religion right they found this guy and supposedly he's supposed to know it all and they said they asked him a question well what about Christianity of all the religions youve studied what's your thoughts about Christianity he goes well he goes the obvious fact there's an empty tomb amen he said but greater than that he said is that the Living God they serve chooses and I thought this was the profound part of this he chooses to live inside the worshiper he chooses to live inside the worshipper Hallelujah I tell you ain't not another religion out there's got a God that does that not another one can say that can testify that my God lives in me they placed him in a borrow Tomb at the ending of that day they watched the soldiers roll the stone oh think about it and then they sadly walked but suddenly within their broken hearts echoed the words they heard him say don't weep for me I'll live again on Resurrection mourn oh aren't you thankful for that on Resurrection mourn he arose to set the captive [Applause] free and on Resurrection mourn Jesus won the victory at breaking of the Dawn they went running to the tomb but he was gone Mary cried and said My Savior Lives on Resurrection MN now listen to these words [Music] here they walked along beside of him [Music] but they did not believe feel this moment right here but he sat with him and broke the bread and then their eyes were made to [Applause] see and as they watched him taken from their side here's the testimony the two men robed in white said like he are sins he'll come again on Resurrection mourn aren't you looking for that amen hallelujah for Resurrection mourn he arose to set the captive free Resurrection born Jesus won the Victory and at breaking of the Dawn they went running to the tomb but he was gone Mary cried and said My Savior live on Resurrection mourn sing these words right here with me now and because he [Applause] lives oh I Can Face Tomorrow be because he Liv do you believe that

righteousness scorn by the ones he came to say Amen until on that cross that Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied for every sin on him was laid oh here in the death of Christ I live there in the

me Hallelujah by him he and he is my I am bought with the precious blood of Christ no guilt and life no fear and death and this is the power of Christ in me from my first cry till final breath oh Jesus commands my destiny no power hell no scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns and calls me home here in the power of Christ I [Applause] Stand Hallelujah aren't you glad you're standing in Christ alone this morning appreciate our song specials today just two [Music] second [Music] the gates and doors are B and all the windows fastened down I spent the night in sleeplessness and Rose at every sound half in Hopeless sorrow half in fear the day would find the soldiers crashing through [Music] to drag us all [Music] away then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall the gate began to Rattle and a voice began to call I hurry to the window and look down to the street expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers [Music] feet but there was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in John stood there beside me as she told us where she'd been she said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where oh the stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there so we both ran towards the garden and then John ran on ahead we found the stone in empty tomb just the way that Mary said but the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell and how and where they'd taken him was more than I could tell something strange had happened there but what I did not know John believed a miracle but I just turned to go circumstan and speculation it couldn't lift me very high cuz I'd seen them crucify him and then I watched him die back inside the house again the guilt and anguish came everything I'd promised him just added to my shame but at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name and even if he was alive it would never be the [Music] same oh but suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume and light that came from everywhere drove Shadows from the room and then Jesus search before me with his arms held open wide and I fell down on my knees and I clung to him and [Music] cried and he raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky and guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release and every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace alive alive he's alive he's alive alive he's alive he's alive alive he's alive he's alive he's alive he's alive he's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he's alive and not forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he's alive and I'm

bless you you can be seated for just a little bit amen yeah praise the Lord it was wonderful all the song specials it's good it starts out there with the little kids and it's fun to watch them they sit there and yeah it's good it's good looks like the church some are interested some are just looking around some are just happy to be up there yeah praise the Lord amen we had a lovely wedding with um brother Nicholas sister Bey Rose and uh certainly had a a lovely time there and um I don't know if you all are aware but when brother Neil mder was going through the issues he was going through and um they said that he probably would not live and she was an ICU nurse on the same floor that he was at and she came by and told him she said brother Neil you have to be alive to be at my wedding to sit on the front row he fulfilled that prophecy on Friday Hall amen and then you know he had his feet amputated portions of his fingers and everything and he he was my right-hand man in the sense that he came here before every service Turned the Lights On music on open my door turn my office uh light on Etc and then this happened and then the brothers had to scramble and I'd come in and nothing was on and lights weren't you know uh I told him I said I sure miss you brother Neil he he said I'll be there brother Ron he said one day will walk through your office under my own power and he says without a cane and without a walker and he says and I'll come greet you he did that this [Applause] morning amen two prophecies fulfilled right there right there amen I love the Lord with all my heart I've been studying now just before and musicians you can go ahead and be seated thank you God bless you guys cuz I'm going to take my time here a little bit and yeah you all know those of you that's been here but are visitors they haven't and they don't perhaps know what I've been speaking on but I've been studying on the abstract title deed I've been studying on the um seven sealed book of redemption yes we've been looking at this uh book that Adam lost which was the title deed of redemption and everything that he lost and how that Humanity was without hope and but we know that God has a plan amen when that fell in the Garden of Eden and uh at Adam lost all his inheritance and they were cast out they lost position they lost their place they lost power that sort of thing but God who's rich in Mercy knows exactly what to do to bring him back why he's Jehovah Gyra he's a God that provides for all our our needs well in studying that it came back into to blend in with the story of redemption of Naomi Ruth and Boaz and so today it's going to be a little bit different of an Easter Service you'll have to wait and see what my title is and the direction I'm going now we certainly thank God for the resurrection amen we thank God there's an empty tomb in Jerusalem all that Pontius pilot and those Heretics in that day that crucified him all they had to do was just keep him there for three days and they would end that whole story but they couldn't that's right they set a guard over it sealed the tomb but he unseals breaks the seals breaks it open why seek ye the living among the dead amen so we thank God for that but our Prophet came in here and and taught us a few other things which I wish to launch out into this morning it may be a little bit different than perhaps what you thought of and uh normally Easter Service is around the resurrection and he lives and everything but actually we celebrate that every Sunday every Sunday it's not just a day of the year and uh that you know and we know uh according to what the prophet of God said and he said Christmas and Easter they're pagan holidays he says have nothing to do with them he said you ought to be ashamed he said to to do and then I don't know if any of you saw on uh um some of the internet there where Joe Biden has uh uh taken and just desecrated even what little bit of Christianity was left and they want no religious symbols no crosses no nothing and he's made it a a a day for the transgenders or something like that and I thought whoa you know what what we do is we're seeing that mystery Babylon coming back and taking everything about God and trying to just defile it all but there is a people hallelujah hallelujah there is a message that has been proclaimed that they know better that's right it ain't an Easter egg it ain't Santa Claus it ain't all this nonsense that the world Mega does on but we thank God for what he has done in this last age now um here we are just for a moment before I launch out into my sermon we are in a time of the changing of dispensations everything is pointing to it prophet of God said Israel is God's time piece he said I want you to look at is Israel and he says that's God's calendar he said watch what they're doing and you'll begin to see the time that you're living in and if you have noticed that they are this is the time of the red heer first time in 2,000 years that they are they're killing the red heer why according to the levitical law and you all know that the temple was destroyed it's Etc and before they can return back to Temple worship they've got to sacrifice the red hepher and uh so they'll take the ashes of it and even brother Brenham says in the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel he says he says now watch they are now a nation and he says uh is that right he says but they have not return to Temple worship yet he says and they will establish the temple worship and when they do the church will be gone how close are we now you you say does it have to be the rebuilding of the temple watch this brother Brenham also says when Abraham built an altar an altar is a place of worship and all they have to do is start their worship at the altar after they've sacrificed the red hepher and the red hepher signifies a Waters of Separation now there is anti-Semitism happening all over the world against Israel and it's prophesied in this last day that we know that they'll do that they'll turn against Israel but not only Israel but Christianity amen after the bride is gone there is going to be a time of Great Tribulation and there's going to be the killing of the 144,000 of the Jews 12,000 from every of the 12 tribes and he said the foolish virgin amen so we're on the brink of something great and terrible because the Bible says that his coming is as a great and terrible day amen and uh also to make you aware that during this time of the red heer and then on April the eth there is a um an eclipse the Bible say says that God will show the signs in the heavens before it happens on Earth he says the Sun the moon all these things are for times and Seasons the word season actually in Hebrew means feast day so it's a time of feast day we know the seven feasts of Jehovah Etc and uh so the enemy likes to come in here and try to uh destroy everything that is Holy unto God so these things that are happening the whole internet right now is a buzz between the red hefer and April the e8th and they're all nervous and Muslims are getting all excited because they're afraid that the mosque of Omar and the Dome of the Rocks going to be tore down and all this in the whole world and and and so but you know what nevertheless God God's word will be fulfilled Hallelujah now we don't have to see those things in order to get ready we've been getting ready for years that's right the bride has made herself ready she's been quickened by a messenger amen we've had Angel visitations that's made us aware of the day and the hour in which we're living that's right amen and brother brandham says now watch this he says Israel when it became ation he says the very hour that the Pan-American chart that Israel was declared a nation for the first time in over 2,000 years since they had been scattered not of people it was the very same hour exactly to the hour that the angel of the Lord met me up yonder and sent me with this gospel the very same thing May the 7th 1946 now he says there's another thing that gives me to know it's restoring the hearts of the children back to the fathers see it's the message of Malachi 4 amen we're seeing what God has been doing we see it in types and shadows but the reason that we are here and we go to of this church is because we are products of an evening light message amen we Fellowship around that word of this hour we're not ashamed of it that's right God bless you let's all stand I'd like you to turn with me into the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy chapter 29 verse 29 so Deuteronomy 2929 then we'll go to Daniel chap 12 then we'll go to Ruth chapter 2 amen Deuteronomy CH 29: 29 the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever somebody say Amen to that amen so secret things belong to God but guess what he does he Reveals His secrets to the servants the prophets that we may do all the words of this law secret things belong unto God but those things which are real revealed belong to us somebody say that's me that's me amen turn with me to Daniel chapter 12 verses 1-4 and at that time shall Michael stand up that great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book Hallelujah and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they shall turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever amen but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased turn with me now back to the Book of Ruth and from here we'll launch out into our sermon and I gave them only verse one of Ruth two but we're going to read down to verse three also and Naomi had a Kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of immc and his name was Boaz you'll have to excuse me for the past two or three days I have been overcome and wept in my stud study in seeing this and Ruth the Mobius said unto Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him whose sight I shall find Grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and her hap very unusual word and her hap we might say her happen stance we might say her chance was to light on a part of the field belonging to Boaz do you think that's coincidence no who was of the Kindred of immc may God add the blessing to his word you all may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord I would like to title this sermon this morning from the seed planted in Genesis to the harvesting of the seed in Revelation I want to take a subject this morning from Mount Calvary to mount Sunset the full picture of redemption brother Brenham says in the sermon Gabriel's instruction to Daniel now our Kinsman has handed the seven sealed book of redemption from the original owner we find out who the original owner was God himself and God came down and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne excuse me and the lamb came down and took the book who was the lamb the Redeemer our kinsman redeemer the Kinsman to the church who come and redeemed Israel now for just a short time this morning if I could have your undivided attention as I go into this seven seal book of redemption and the story of Boaz and Ruth brother Brenham uses words such as the abstract title deed he says and all of those who were ordained to eternal life were names written in the book in fact Jesus told his disciples don't Rejoice that demons are subject to you but rather Rejoice that your names are written Hallelujah in the book Hallelujah so the book then is a Heavenly registry it's got to be that way why because the title deed is given to to someone who's going to receive the inheritance so it's got to Bey on the title deed that's right brother Brenham said those names are written within the book he said it's a registry of God's seed Gene amen because God is interested in his family he's interested in fact all the way in all of the books of the Bibles we find genealogies and Abraham begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob and so on and so forth and you read long genealogies why he's showing you a registry amen he's showing you something that is going to foreshadow what God is doing even in this end time now we see the work of redemption done in many stories within the Bible but the one of of Boaz as the kinsman redeemer and how that he redeems Naomi and Ruth is a real good picture for this end time now brother Brenham says in the third seal let me just build up now as we go he says we found out that a slain lamb is a bloody lamb bleeding all over it's been slain it's been slain I it had raised again and was sitting on the throne and say back in the throne like this interceding for all those Souls that would come then when the last one was here and it was completed what is he talking about when that last one that's on the registry when it comes in he says when it has finally come into and takes its position he said God still held that book of redemption he's just doing the Kinsman work now like Boaz went down and Ruth was just sitting there waiting until Boaz I mean Boaz done the Kinsman redeeming work amen The Book of Ruth is actually one of my favorite books I love to read it because it seems like every other sentence every other verse of the Book of Ruth just tells another portion of the story of redemption it's all written right there if you understand the Book of Ruth you understand the whole Plan of Redemption The Book of Ruth actually opens up with the death of three people but it ends in a wedding Hallelujah there's a loss of inheritance people are out of the promised land they have no no hope in fact when IMC dies and Naomi is left there she says you should name me Mara because God has dealt with me bitterly how many know that's what your Bible says and how many times even though we as elect seed and we sometimes suffer because of our own consequences that we have done amen that's right and then when you go through some very hard trials you say this is too bitter you might as well say God is dealing with me bitterly but thank God you don't stay in a place of bitterness because you're going to find out that all things work together for the good to them that love God Amen somebody say Amen to that oh you might have some times of real testings and trials who's without it every son and daughter of God must be tried and tested to see What You're Made Of you see when you catch the revelation of the story of redemption it's all written right there in the Book of Ruth she says call me Mara but you see watch this sadness has turned to Joy and they all sing a new song at the end of the Harvest Time the Bible opens with the death of three people a loss of inheritance and it ends with a wedding where the bride is united with the groom are we seeing typ and Shadow here now everyone is rejoicing sadness turns to Joy Joy the 4 and 20 Elders fall down and those 10,000s times thousands and thousands all began to worship the lamb that had been slain and they begin to sing a new song now the Kinsman is actually one who is related to you by blood or marriage it is the one who is called who has the right to redeem redemption in Hebrews means to set free by the paying the price of the penalty it has two parts a coming out and going into and so we understand that Redemption therefore has two parts you come out of something but then you go into something else we don't want to just say praise God I came out of hisory Babylon it came out of denominationalism but that we must say we're going into the Promised word which is the message of this hour Redemption is actually referred to over 15 times in the Book of Ruth the third chapter alone 15 times redeem this redeem redeem 15 times in one chapter Boaz had to bring both Naomi and Ruth out of bondage and then bring them to their inheritance and he had to perform the right of the nearer Kinsmen and I want you to understand this that it was their Union with Boaz one as a Kinsman and two as a husband Boaz now brings them back into their inheritance that was lost by immc and there remember now there were two daughters that had married excuse me two women that had married the sons of a limc so when you know this story here and you look at it and you see um you will find out that Naomi and Ruth are spoken about in The Inheritance but orpa never why she was given the choice do you want to go or why don't you go back she went ahead and went back let me say this there is no in inheritance to those who go back so now three main characters of the book are Naomi Ruth and Boaz amen the three main characters of the whole Bible is Israel the bride and Jesus Naomi is a type of that or Orthodox Jewish Church God's chosen people they are known as the people of God they are the descendants of Adam who was the son of God down to Abraham and Ruth is a type of a gentile Church chosen by God and she is from the land of Moab do you know where Moab comes from it is the incestuous family the results from lot the first daughter that went into her father brought forth Moab where you get the mobites the next one came and brought forth the ammonites both of them that gave Israel all kinds of trouble and Boaz is called the lord of the Harvest he's in charge of all of the Reapers and when you look at the lineage of Boaz he is a son of Salon who married Rahab are we together on that it was during the the destruction of Jericho that they had sent in two spies brother Brenham actually calls them two tape boys it says and what she did she opened her her house and made a church and she had heard about the devastation that was coming because Joshua was the avenging Angel so she she hid the two spies in her home and and she said I want you because of my kindness that I'm doing to you I want you to tell me you won't destroy me and my family when you come and they said well we'll tell you you've got to apply a token H are you listening it ain't just agreeing with it it ain't just recognizing what's happening but it's to apply the token said if you'll hang that Scarlet thread which is a type of the blood of Christ if you will hang that outside the window let me tell you the death angels and judgment will not strike youall hallelujah thank God for that [Applause] [Music] token no doubt Boaz has heard the story many times from his mother RAB it said I was lost undone I was a harlot right but because I recognized what God was doing and I made my home a church I had a invisible Union I saw the uniting time and sign that's right praise the Lord yes and they said if you'll have this token outside your window if you'll get your family under that token said we are not responsible if you don't get your family underneath that token amen God help us to apply the token get our family in I don't know if they whether they understand it or not but you just say get in and get under that token she was redeemed from her shame and reproach of her past sins by her Union to salon and according to the Old Testament law and Deuteronomy 25: 5 and 6 if there is no air for the family name and inheritance and it's lost then a kinsman redeemer can redeem redeem the Widow and take her unto himself and raise up seed of his brother the firstborn which she Bears shall succeed in the name of his brother listen to those words and the firstborn that is and so we see now watch this Adam lost here's a a Son of God put in the Garden of Eden he lost his inheritance so now Christ Our kinsman redeemer had to come by way of Flesh bir to pay the penalty of the price of redemption that's why he went to Calvary amen that's why he was crucified there was a price to be paid right thank God that He Paid a Debt amen that I could not pay amen Lord he could not God could not come down in a glorified body and pay the price no so he came down in a form of man which we called Emanuel God With Us he came down himself thank you Lord amen amen took upon himself the sins of man mankind Lord thank you Lord so we see the firstborn son shall succeed the name of his brother which is dead so the scripture says in 1 Corinthians 15 45-47 and so it is written the first man Adam was a living soul and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual and the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven now brother Brenham says in the sermon the law having a shadow 1954 he says watch this there goes the second adom one brought death and here comes the one bringing life two different Adams first Adam second Adam here's the one who's bringing life in the world the second one with his own blood hitting his legs like that the Son of God going to Calvary to bear away your our sins Yonder that through the shedding of blood to perfect a man or woman unconditionally and I love to use that word unconditionally because it when God made covenants with man he made him with Adam Adam couldn't keep it he made him with Noah Noah couldn't keep it he made it with Abraham and you find out that what he did with Abraham is he just kind of rigged this thing and he said Abraham I'm going to give you an unconditional Covenant it's not what you're going to do it's not how good you are it's not how many times you keep the Commandments it's not all of that but it's about me making a sacrif for you I'm going to make a covenant that that Abraham you're going to make it hallelujah thank you Lord are you listening to Abraham you're going to make it God's not looking at you on how good you are how many times you go to church the reason you go to church is because you show him you love him not because none of us going to walk through those perly Gates and say uh how many stars do I have on the roll up there every time I went to church like kids in kindergarten yeah you little star well I I deserve going yeah no it's Grace how many know it's [Applause] Grace for by grace are you saved through faith and that is a gift of God it is not of Works lest any man boast so even the faith you got into believing that he's God God gave it to you thank you Lord so that ought to make every one of us humble and and say God it's just by your grace because you're the one that gave me Faith you're the one that called me you're the one that that has elected me you're the one that chose me I didn't choose you you chose me Hallelujah now now everything that the first Adam lost the second Adam redeemed amen that's why here on Earth Adam nature obeyed him he was a God over the garden over the Earth because God was the god of the universe over the whole thing I want you to understand that the first pull has to do with the outer Court the healing of the body the second pull goes in further called the inner Court Discerning of spirits and the third poll to the holy of holies the word revealed to the heart Thy word oh Lord have I hid in my heart amen not in my head where's the greatest battle ever fought about 18 Ines apart from the Mind listen you you you battle so many times in your mind you go through this trial that trial things happen to you and you I don't understand oh my I'm just like Naomi you might as well call my name Mara well hang on Naomi you got a kidsman redeemer that is right there and he is going to perform the work of a Kinsman Redeemer and when he does you're going to sing a new song hallelujah hallelujah amen four distinct phases of Ruth yeah one Ruth deciding she has to make a decision Naomi said why didn't you go back she said no no orpa said yeah I'll go back I keep wanting to say Oprah but I think it's the same they kiss God goodbye anyway Ruth deciding you see God chooses you but you got to you got free moral agency amen you have to say okay huh it's like I was so nervous when when I went to ask my wife if she'll marry me boyfriend girlfriend I loved her I thought she'd loved me and everything but boy I tell you what I needed so much strength I parked in front of the church that's where I propose I didn't go to some nice big mountain top or a Lakeside and beautiful all this stuff and you know violins playing everything man I'm shaking like a leaf and I said if says if this woman hesitates they she says give me time to pray about it so I pulled up in front of the church you know God give me all sandy sandy will you uh uh Sandy will you uh will you marry me and she said yes and I was about ready to well if you can't give yes that was too quick that was too easy she decided I chose but she chose my choosing are you understanding God chose you he says I've chosen you you haven't chosen me but when you recognize he chose you what do you do I choose to go with [Applause] him Rebecca do you ch choose just the gifts or do you want to go with elaser I choose to go see what I'm saying so Ruth deciding Ruth serving Ruth resting Ruth rewarded oh I love this story so if you want to turn with me to the second chapter of Ruth let's look at this real quickly to show you a few things cuz I love to watch this pattern develop it's kind of like seeing a picture within a picture when you look at it for a minute you might see an old hagged lady but you look at it closer and oh it turns into a beautiful woman it depends on your perspective so now the Bible is one of those things that when you look at it and you look at it outright you might see a wrong picture yeah but hang on and wait because let it develop you understand let it develop because there is something that is happening that is Supernatural that goes beyond the natural and if your footsteps are ordered of the Lord let me tell you God has watched over you and that elect seed since you were born Amen in fact he was so much looking over you that he knew what kind of character he knew what kind of complex and he took your great great great and you put them together and this teting and that all the way down until you came on the scene and there's not a one here whether you were expected planned or unwanted you came on the scene amen and let me tell every one of you none of you is a mistake that's right thank you Jesus you came here cuz God been watching over you how many of you even prior to conversion did you have these little near misses oh boy I almost bit the bullet on that one there was a there was a wreck there was a fall there was some kind of deal that happened oh my you've been dodging that thing for a long time but it really wasn't you God did not let your number get pulled he was watching over that elex se he knew you would come a time of recognition oh he says an elect seed can go a long time before he recognizes who he is some of you are so thickheaded he could have a donkey talk to you and you'd argue with the donkey God has watched over you Lord and you can go back in your life and see supernaturally that God has watched over you now Ruth Chap 2: 14-6 and Boaz says unto her at Meal Time Come Thou thither spiritual food in due season eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat bes IDE the Reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left now parch corn is the new grain that's prepared on the spot the type of those crossing over in the first Exodus remember that the Mana ceased when they got into the promised land okay so something's happening here he gives her now Parts K verse 15 and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheep and reproach her not he's saying hey boys I got a now a nice little virtuous woman that's going to be working down here don't you be bugging her and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not I want all of you to know that God has watched over you and he's told all of these other guys keep your hands off them and I'll tell you what that even right in the midst of laiaa I want you to drop to them once in a while handfuls of blessings amen wasn't something you deserved it wasn't cuz you're the best one to glean in the field no it's because it was on purpose let me tell you everything that is coming to you is on purpose you didn't just find that you just didn't come to this message it was on purpose actually if you know the story here Boaz is having communion with his bride before he redeems her true Hees it came down had communion with Abraham before the promise came Christ has communion with his disciples before he goes to Calvary and the prophet preaches communion before he leaves the scene I tell you it just gets Rich if you just start looking and seeing type after type and what Ruth had left over she brought to Naomi now here's an interesting thing when you look in the scriptures there and you find out when the Mother-in-law when Naomi says to Ruth she says um well what happened here how did it go my daughter and actually in the in the authorized version of the Hebrew text it says who are you my daughter in other words are you still Ruth the Mobius or are you the prospective Mrs Boaz did something happen because she was under expectation why would she ask the question why who are you my daughter she's saying did he propose did he make a promise are you engaged oh I love this so Ruth rests and She lays herself at the feet of Boaz why feet feed her possession and Boaz has communion with his bride and what he h what she has left over she brings to Naomi now what's interesting is when Ruth approaches Boaz and he she is following the instructions of Naomi Naomi says you're going to find him he's the lord of the Harvest and you're going to find him on the threshing floor so she goes down and she finds him on the threshing floor floor that's where he works he's working today this is the threshing floor thank you Lord this is where things in your life are beaten and threshed and blown out of your life any of you have ever been to a third world country and watched somebody thresh the wheat they don't have the the big refineries and and places like we do over here so I in Africa where they'll put or in India where they put all the Grain on the road they let the cars drive over it 50 m an hour there goes all the chaff and everything like that and the seed still stays there or they take it and they beat on it right then they take it and throw it in the air and don't you realize it when you come to church on why is that guy always on my case seems like he's always beating me always stepping on my toe always getting on my case I need to do this better I need to do that better you know what God's doing he's beating the chaff away from your seed Hallelujah and wins the doctrine and everything and his his fan is in his hand and he's thoroughly purging his wheat you don't need that in your life you don't need that in your life get away from the world there's things of the world what is he doing he's driving that chaff away from the sea thank you Lord somebody say thank you Lord you she requests him to spread his skirt over her yeah the skirt in Hebrew is shell s hu l or his H and there's an emblem on the Hem of the Garment that shows the rank or authority like a pilot who shows on his sleeve or on his shoulder here three stripes four Stripes shows the authority so when when Ruth puts herself under the authority of Boaz she just puts herself under his hem are you listening that's why you've got to come under the authority of Jesus Christ you just don't with your lips say you love him and your hearts are far from him but we come under his headship thank God we're in the time of the headship and here we are at this changing of dispensations and Nebuchadnezzar who had a dream and Daniel saw the dream also and he said I'm telling you head of gold Brad silver but there's coming a time he said that this image this Gentile image are you listening this Gentile dispensation is quickly closing he said there's five Western five eastern he says kusf and Eisenhower met at the United Nations five Western five eastern Eisenhower means iron kusf means clay and here it was us trying the mingling and they won't mingle but at that time there's coming an image there's coming a stone a Capstone if you please that's coming out of heaven and it's coming and smiting this image Hallelujah that's what's happening now this message you'll never destroy this message that's right you can't destroy it why this message is Christ it is a Capstone Ministry it is a token message than you here's something interesting when she is discovered at his feet he says who are you she didn't say Ruth the Mobius she's already got Revelation she's already under his and she says I'm Ruth thy hand me she's already saying and then watch he answers her and he says my daughter stay here and rest amen until the rising of the Sun until a new day am fear not little church am Shalom don't you realize there's been a new dat that has dawned over the bride peace I give unto you what's God doing he's declaring don't fear because I the Kinsman don't worry I that told you I would do all all these things I will not rest until the kinsman redeemer is done until I've done it but there's a nearer Kinsman Philippians 1 and6 be confident of this very thing that he which begun a good work in you will perform it till the day of Jesus Christ so which one of you are just sitting there shaking in your boots wondering if God's going to finish the work he started how many of you can say I I know he started to work in me then we also have to have this confidence hey he's going to finish it that's his business praise the Lord listen he's going to save you despite yourself why we were yet sinners Christ died for us it wasn't until after we come to the knowledge after we became good people after we got baptized after we got the Holy Ghost after a no no before all of that in fact before the foundation of the world God plac on your finger unmar favor amen Ruth became confident believing the words of Boaz is not the bride doing the same thing I'm confident that this work that Jesus said he's going to finish he'll do it Ruth 3 let's read Ruth 3: 9-13 and he said who art thou and she said I am Ruth thy handmade spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter already having relationship do you see he's saying you're my family for thou H has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in so much as thou followed not the young men whether rich or poor yeah she was tested amen who you going to follow after come on and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the Sea of my people do know the I a virtuous woman see Talk's been going around all the people hey you know hey you guys know that lady named Ruth out there she well she's from Mo Moab she's a Mobius but boy oh boy she's a virtuous woman it's gone through the family and now it's true that I am thy near Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman nearer than i t this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let him do the Kinsman part but if he will not do the part of a Kinsman to thee then I will do the part of the Kinsman to thee as the Lord liveth lie down until the morning what happened there was a cloud on the title any of you know when you buy a piece of property you buy title insurance to make sure there's no incumbrance on that title so that when you buy it that the title can be transferred from whoever had ownership to it to your ownership but if there's a cloud on the title it's got to be taken care of so we had a cloud on our title that's right we had a nearer Kinsman and before we could be redeemed we had to give him an opportunity but guess what he won't pay the price that's right Adam sin the whole human race was taken out of position with their inher inance and the nearer Kinsman was our association un Union to our first husband that had rule over you watch this the invisible Union of the bride of Christ brother R says that now it was your nature associated with death your first husband that had rule over you was your Nature by natural birth every one of you came into the world hybrid amen natural you love the world because you are the world and part of the world is that right your desires was by nature to love the world which you're a part of you're a part of nature you believe that that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again because that which is of the flesh is flesh you don't have to tell a kid how to lie they know how to lie you don't have to tell them how to beat to the music just put the music on and put a little baby in front of the speaker they're Born to Boogie it's nature amen so your nearer Kinsman was the relationship that you had because of the Fall you came down here in a body that had to be born again oh I love it well you can't live with it say that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you had to die to that first husband you can't live with it you can't say well I'll divorce him and hang him up there till the occasion no sir no writing of divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die and every spec of him has to die you have to be reunited with another nature born again there's really been a change in me born again just like Jesus said watch this born again he says I'm now a new creature in Christ those things which I hated now I love and those things that I love I now hate thank you Lord for the new birth thank you I want you to notice in the Book of Psalms chter 49: verses 6 through 8 they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to God a ransome for him for the Redemption of their soul is precious and it ceases forever so it's not see just by riches it's got to be a nearer Kinsman it got to be part of the family did you know that Naomi now watch this I I'm just going to Rabbit Trail here for just a minute and you just follow along with me Naomi is married to IMC and Boaz is of the family or the tribe of IMC now they leave and they go to a place called Moab they leave the promised land they go into Moab and they set up having church it's so sad that instead of staying where God had told him to stay in the promised land that he goes now to a place of Moab incestuous unclean compromising type people and he goes there and guess what he has two sons maon and chilon and maon means invalid and chilon means a whiner and a complainer you know anybody like that it is a type of when here a seed Gene of God limc leaves and goes elsewhere sets up church and guess what they have not enough seed to bring forth life therefore when LMC dies it took 10 years and guess what maon and chilion don't have any kids Ruth and orpa have no kids the church is not growing but finally Naomi has enough sense to say you know what I don't belong here my inheritance is here if there's anything that I'm going to do I'm going back to where IMC was birth that why because my union my union to ELC a woman's right of inheritance is through the man and the bride's inheritance is through Jesus Christ and you become joiners all that I am you can be everything I own is part yours the Lord H praise the Lord how many families have you seen that have left the message of the hour to go somewhere else for a better job and they go there and they they work and guess what they have their little church woman is a church and there's no seed there's nothing now God blessed Abraham as long as he stayed in the promised land when he got out of the promised land he lost his Blessing is that right not his Covenant he lost his Blessing now brother brand picks us up recognizing your day in its message I'm just going to take the the portion here and highlight Israel in her land drove them in there hurted them in there like sheep the Wolves got after her and run them back to safety to their own land how many of you know that brother Brenham said the the loving tender hand of Jehovah drove the Jews back to Israel they were persecuted I've been to aitz been there twice I've seen what they did in the Holocaust I've seen the starvation shells I've seen the Wall of Death I've seen the gas Chambers I've seen the crematoriums and they did all of that and tried to exterminate a race of people because of what they believed and the anti-Semitism that you're seeing against Israel right now will come against the Christians it's coming am I say oh God take us out of here I don't want to be no foolish virgin I don't want to stay here when that peel horse rider begins to ride and death and Hell follow him that's right remember Israel's only promise to be blessed as long as she's in her land God never blessed Israel outside of the land Abraham went outside the land was condemned and everyone that leaves the land is condemned God only can bless Israel when she stays in her Homeland and she is there now as a nation and the church is called she's just only waiting for the Rapture of the Bride taken out the seals are op so revealed to usj we see what they left off you want to debating fuss about serpent seed water baptism and so forth you're blinded and don't know it the God of this world has blinded you to it you don't know it wonder I had such a time this morning fighting through them pressures immc see had left the promised land dwelt in Moab a place of compromise uncleanness they never became Overcomers Church never prospered milon was invalid and chilon was pining and and wasting away but Naomi a woman of character she knows the only hope for her is to go back home that's right you know there's no place like home that's right oh you can go and you can visit places and it's nice there's something about coming home walking through your door your bed your kitchen huh brother Warren he says brother Ron I've I've been so busy I think he preached 14 times in 10 days he said I get to sleep in my own bed tonight is that right brother Warren there ain't no place like home saints of God there's no place like going back home home somebody just say home home they're just something about home I'm going home amen are you with me on that this is not my home I'm just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue when it's over for me on this Earth guess what I'm going back home hallelujah amen now Ruth is a moabitas brother renam in 1956 preaches the true and false Vine he says they come up to the country of Moab Moab where did they spring from from lot's daughters Child by her father the mobites is not unbelievers they were worshippers of Jehovah God certainly they was they even had a fine preacher out there by the name of balam a prophet but like a whole lot of hireling prophets was money crazy amen selling their gifts they're doing it today yes they are find gifted things out in the world to make money it's a disgrace compromising borderline one day in the world next day in the church you can't do that you got to sell out be born again move Plum Inland as far as you can stay off that borderline amen Naomi had no inheritance in Moab she had to go to the homeland of immc thank you Revelation chapter 5 musicians go ahead and come here I'm going to I got a few more quotes here but I'm going to just keep going on he says nail me and Boaz just a perfect picture Naomi in the time of famine left the church left the country went over into Moab land to dwell there and sojourn there when she comes back she brings back the beautiful young Mite Widow with her and when Boaz saw this Widow a type of Christ he fell for and he loved her so he had to redeem the only way he could ever get her to be a wife was to redeem what his brother immc had lost Naomi's only inheritance is through the union with her husband do you realize that you women according to scripture your inheritance is through your union with your husband Ruth decides to go with Naomi in fact she's given the decision and I think it's some of the most wonderful words she says whether thou goest I will go amen your God will be my God your people will be my people and where you die I'll die your land will be my [Music] land Ruth made a commitment to stay with Naomi and brought her into the position to meet her kinsman redeemer the crucifixion of Jesus Christ was when the price was paid for [Music] Redemption thank you Lord he said it's finished he paid the price thank you Lord he was the Lamb of God he was crucified he struggled so bad remember you can't kill God spirit of God left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he asked let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done spirit of God left him and there he as a mortal man bleeding and bruised was whipped up the hill There They Crucified him until the man Christ Jesus Cries Out Eli Eli [Music] Lama my God why have you forsaken [Music] me and he says it is finished the price kinsman redeemer by his own blood not the blood of bulls and goats by the Lamb of God himself and he was crucified but there's another part most denomination have got no idea there's another part it's called the seven sealed book of redemption who's worthy chapter five who's worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and I looked in heaven and I looked on Earth and there was no one worthy no one to take the book The Price had been paid but there's nobody there to actually take it and redeem it it's mine and I John wept one of the elders behind him said we've not John yes for the lion of the tribe of Judah Boaz is of the tribe of [Music] Judah and the [Music] lamb changes transforms because he come he turns to look at a lamb having been slain and what does he see a [Music] lion and a lion is Judge he's now bringing a judgment brother Ram said there he is white hair of his wig look at his picture there he is Ancient of Days who is it the Supreme judge looking down on the earth this message this seven sealed book of redemption we had no idea it was the second part until this Prophet comes and tells us no one is going to be redeemed off of the earth now watch this now we're talking about the fullness of the Redemption at the first resurrection we all know what that is when the dead in Christ shall rise that's the first resurrection and only those in the first resurrection are those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life not book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life the Bible says and everyone will have will whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life will be deceived there's only a small group of people on the Earth that happen to see these things that are going on right now and the reason that they don't celebrate Christmas with a Christmas tree and Santa Claus and do all of that kind of stuff nor give out chocolate Easter bunnies and do Easter egg hunts and all that stuff why because they know better they've come out come out of her my people be ye separate sayeth the Lord so while God is now finishing up with the Gentile by giving to us a message and getting us prepared guess what Israel is getting ready to receive their two prophets can't you see the blending of the dispensation is just about over it's just about home time hallelujah hallelujah Ruth chapter 4 let me close with Ruth chapter 4 here and Ruth 4:1 and all the people were in the gate and the elders we Are Witnesses Lord make the woman that has come into thine house like Rachel and Leah two women mentioned Rachel and Leah who are actually bore unto Jacob eight sons who became founding tribes of the nation of Israel so this woman that comes into the house may she be like Rachel and Leah which did build the house of Israel and do thou worthily in ephrath and be famous in Bethlehem the word ephrath means [Music] fruitful they want Ruth to become fruitful and bring honor to a little insign insignificant city called Bethlehem later called the city of David wow verse 12 and let thy house be like the house of ferah whom T Tamar bear unto Judah wow remember what Tamar did in order to get [Music] seed so Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife and he went in under her and the lord gave her conception and she bear a son wow the woman said to Naomi blessed be the Lord which hath not left thee this day without a Kinsman that his name may be famous in Israel and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life are you listening to Mara remember she says don't don't call me Naomi call me Mara said no here's what's going to happen I'm going to restore unto you your life and a nurser of thine old age for thy daughter-in-law which is Ruth which loveth thee is better to thee than seven songs better than the seven Messengers sent to the seven [Music] churches because Ruth is the bride to boy you realize the day that we're living in this is the greatest day this is the cresendo it's greater than the creation greater than when he said let there be light and there was light and he did the fishes and the land and the trees and everything and he said it was good but this is the climax this is the cresendo and he's doing it ever so simple at all these things what Israel is doing right now are we looking at God's calendar can we see what Israel is doing can we see these eclipses for times and Seasons we can see the uniting time and sign the invisible Union of the bride of Christ can we see really what this message is all about it's not just church order I want all of you to understand that God is fulfilling his word in this hour oh it's so much more Amen on how to dress a way of Holiness but it's a relationship between you and Boaz your kinsman redeemer aren't you don't you love him today amen what makes us different than denomination out there they're worshiping a Christ who Rose 2,000 years [Music] ago they worship Christ in a Manger every Christmas they don't have the Revelation you got that's right yours is so different you are different why God's called you to be different thank you Lord amen that's why you are what you are that's why God sent a prophet in this end end time that's why God sent an angel Messenger to turn your hearts back why cuz he's finishing up the act of redemption right now when this last Gentile comes in and the times of the Gentiles over there's not going to be another Gentile saved that's right no the bride's going to get taken off of the earth she's going to go up Revelations 10's going to be finished you can't have Revelation 11 the two witnesses to Israel that's right until Revelation 10 goes off the scene Joseph married a gentile bride put her in the palace and while she's in the palace right he comes down and makes himself known to his Brethren can we see the types and shadows of what God is doing even right now oh I love [Music] him hallu thank you Jesus this message is becoming more and more real to me every [Music] day it's only been in the last several days I've told my wife I
