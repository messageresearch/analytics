Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can be seated for just a moment I have a praise report here amen amen God bless you I'm going to read it thank you sister an you guys can just go ahead and quit playing while I read this here um this uh was she called me today sister Josephine did this is her praise report she said due to multiple symptoms that I had I went to ultrasound for my thyroid 10 weeks ago and they found a bad nodule I was referred to an endocrinologist right away 7even days ago this doctor told me the nodule was bad and to be honest with um you look it looked like cancer thus the biopsy should be done as soon as possible sometimes it's just easy for us to say if it's not yours if if it's not yours but if it's knocking at your door it's a different story yeah listen when when it comes down to us yeah amen and to our wife or our children or our body our prayers get a little more serious don't they yes yeah God help us to the Bible says that when one member suffers the whole body suffers it's a different story only mind I told the doctor that God is in control watch the confession of faith my flesh was a little nervous for the fight is real capital letter is real but deep down in my soul I was excited of what God will do amen as the day approaching what can a Believer do other than believe I counted it as a blessing and an a good opportunity but I was talking to God as if he is just around and we never mention or give attention to what the doctor told us because I never believe his report from the first place though I can feel the symptoms brother Brenham tells us don't listen to the the symptoms amen he said go to the promise amen I did I searched and Googled it and boy I'll tell you what if you ever want to have your mind go to playing hey Google it huh search it out oh man every symptom I got oh oh yeah oh yeah see textbook uh I searched it Google it and above all but I said it's not for me we talk more of God's promises and the things he has done and the benefits of the believer that we have to enjoy yesterday I was listening to brother Brennan preaching about the six sense two times Faith cometh by hearing the revealed word and created more faith to me today was the day of my biopsy Before We Gather for prayer I've told Hannah to tell bethl to clean up the pantry after working because I cannot do do it due to biopsy that I need to rest but something telling me that I'll come back and do it amen Mario gathered bethl and Hannah and my mother to pray Mario said Lord we will go to the hospital just to confirm your never failing promises our Miracle working God Amen see she is healed because we believe amen few hours ago I was laying on the operating table this was today operating table with all the needles gauze syringe around me they prepped for the biopsy and to be honest my flesh was nervous because I don't like needles she and she's a nurse go figure I don't like them either the assistant doc told the final ultrasound to make sure that the nodule is there before the IR doctor will do the puncture she said it's there I said why I told you that things going to go away and they all laughing said maybe uh we're not trying maybe you're not trying hard enough but in my mind I didn't believe that then Dr Andrew came and turned my neck towards him place the towel ready to duby SE with guided ultrasound then he kept getting more pictures and more and more there's no need for me to do a biopsy because it's liquid and there's nothing in there I said my God is real and he is alive and a Healer Lord the assistant who said that I did not try harder said it's a miracle Miracle God thank you Lord I said there are people in the last days that will believe the miracle working God and his name is Jesus Christ I jumped off of that table I got dressed I was testifying to the people in the clinic as it went out into that building and this quote struck me during the preaching last Wednesday the law having a shadow this brother brandham in Chicago 56 I believe the time will soon arrive that when healing will be a miracle healing such as a common thing we've got to get some rapturing faith in the church to get away from here for one of these days brother Brenham can say that day is today and To God Be glory honor Praises It All Belongs to Him Sister Josephine amen yeah [Applause] that was today's sister Joseph yeah when doubt knocks at the door yes and Faith answers yes there's no one there amen oh I love him I thank God for that what a wonderful testimony I had brother Joe Adams he he sent me a note here probably I don't know three four weeks ago and asked brother Ron do you have any Miracles going on in your church that you'd like to to well it seems weekly almost daily on a basis how many of you know that God's worked miracles in your life let me see it amen that that undeniably look at this over 3/4 over probably 9/10 of the people in the church Miracle after miracle and even the Bible says that if we if we told you all of the wonderful works of God and the Mires that he did uh there couldn't be enough pages in the book to contain the whole so we thank God Amen for that so God bless you all okay brother Mark I'll turn it back to you amen praise the Lord change of course let's sing thanks thanks I give you thanks how many are thankful for what the Lord has done for you

we may f fill oh Father God what you had in your mind Lord before the foundation of the world are blessed we are father knowing Lord that these things were unknown to men there's nothing new Under the Sun because it's you who have preed it all father as Lord we have fulfilling L father God this part of our journey let L father God your anointing father for yes Lord because the world is falling

I see more Lord father may we all together Lord give you praise Lord as we as all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen may the Lord bless you tonight it is uh a privilege once again to be found in the house of the Lord uh let's take our Bibles in the book of second King Kings chapter 2 verse 23-25 thank you musicians thank you brother R for your opportunity and the church for coming again tonight for spending a little bit of time in the presence of the Lord verse 23 and he went up from Den unto bethl and he was going up by the way there came forth a little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the Lord and there came forth two she Bears out of the woods and tear and tear 40 and2 children of them and he went from then to Mount Carmel and then he returned to Samaria may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated uh we are still uh continuing with uh what we have started uh on uh seeing Jesus in this program and uh this will be I believe part five and Elijah's ministry will be on part two um we been covering such uh part of the word believing that uh there's no three four five program in this last day there's only one program program which is God's program and we believe that uh only a elect people are given this program in this hour because in the contest in the passing of 1962 to 63 he said Lord has uh we are passing and the whole thoughts of 62 are dying out and we getting into 63 uh may we become better servants may we see Jesus and his program show us the rock beneath the rock uh because uh in this hour we see all kind of agendas in the world uh and people we get swayed by all these kind of agendas as we have seen the prophet showing us the whole uh end time under those seven Visions we see that we have uh the world with the part of the ministry what they are fulfilling but by God's grace also God at some time also has a part of the Bride but then uh we understand that uh in the mystery of marriage uh it's not just about becoming a bride because uh getting married is uh a one- day event there can be a lot of preparation before that courtship and love story and uh doing some some investigation on the lady and on the brother could this be uh the right person you're going to pray and all that but then afterward then you come you make the vow you say well you are my head you lead me from this time on I am not under anybody else leadership and uh during courtship the lady sits under the men Ministry is receiving she's receiving she's saying amen and the more she gets closer the more she start speaking like him she start looking like him she dresses the way he likes it that's why brother Bram say don't be unequally yolked because uh Ahab went down there and uh followed the painting and the makeups and and all the tight skirts and the shorts and everything and the BPS and stuff but then before he knows it he find himself into trouble so it is also with Elisha as we saw it last time that Elisha set under the ministry of uh Elijah whereby he understood that under such a Ministry this is where she was going to become the last voice to the last age and uh in the message we are so much acquainted you are the bride believe it amen we are the bride such a good thing but then afterward all the marriage ceremony all the cloud appeared all the pictures taken now the voice says go take the book eat it and now go prophesize and now Elisha goes out to prophesy because Elijah was taken up 63 65 the man is out of the scene the officer United the church and the head such a great mystery of the seven seal in this hour whereby ministers feel so good when they preach about the seven seal but uh afterward there's a Ministry brother Bram will the bride have a Ministry yes she has a Ministry and now the application of the ministry because Jesus was born as a baby seed of God Son of God and Jesus grew in Statue before God and men and at the banks of the river Jesus received the Holy Ghost because the Cloud came down and the voice said to whom that you shall see the voice uh the the the uh the dove come down that's the one he said that Behold the Lamb he has a Ministry to do his ministry is to take away the sins of the world and right away after this he went into the Wilderness to pray 40 days and 40 night butam says he had to stay in such a fellowship with the father because right after mat 4 comes into view and he was tempted right away and the devil took him up and started showing him all kind of things the ministry was into action so it was also with Elijah so it was with William brunham when the angel of the Lord visited him he went and Roy David said you know no those things was talking about like you know those are you probably had a bad Supper The Temptations was right out of the gate so was Elisha Elisha we understand that he sat under such a Ministry wonderful Ministry of the hour because Elisha is uh the bride not only the bride because after marriage you move from being the bride to a spouse to a wife and now under such a condition now comes a responsibility a responsibility to do the work and the work is not something to uh to brag about to go on the street to say well you know I the Bride of the end time because at that time we find ourself oh everybody is gone yeah Jesus was at the the the bank of the river everybody was looking who's that man what is he doing what's happening what is all this light coming about then afterward she goes home then she find herself she has to do the dishes she has to start sweeping every day she has to start cooking every day how does she cook how does she handle the stress of the children brother bam says you have to understand it's a responsibility because when those children come under that Ministry they going to start now uh messing with the walls and jumping on the chairs and everything right then it's no more about going on the street I am the bride I am the bride I am married I am married now she knows how am I going to deal with this this child doesn't listen my husband doesn't listen to me my wife doesn't listen my church doesn't listen it is a responsibility one thing it is to say like you know oh look at the day look at our picture 1963 turning to the right and it is another now to eat the book and prophesize to many people and here is Elisha after succeeding to Elijah he found himself like you know man of God the land is good but the water here is not good at all can you come and help us can you come and preach to us oh brother we love your sermon oh we love the your ministry oh God has sent you all over the world we we're streaming you oh you're such a wonderful sister oh your life is a testimony to us after such a miracle in his life then come the test and and he went up from Dan unto Bethel and as he was going up by the way they came forth little children out of the city and mocked him under such a great anointing under such a great Vindication after such testimonies of what God is doing in his ministry after living such a good life as a virgin getting into marriage as such now comes the struggle right because when he was giving me the Elijah's Ministry part two it's like I got into a store room with many many layers or many gifts I saw the part of looking at it from the children perspective why they had to behave that way I saw it from this perspective but he told me no take this one here I said well we'll take that but I believe by God's grace as sons of God in the message we know that why the children had to behave the way they behave and he found himself there challenged by the little children they said well bhead grow up too oh we saw you know the Miracles in brother brother Ministry oh we saw your husband was this and all this here but then what about you you too old so go up but then the men lost temper really quickly the men lost control when the minister start touching certain places yeah then we we are not comfortable anymore when the husband say like you don't know you have to listen to me that the word said that your place is here don't you can't tell me anything you can't tell me what to do but you were just under such great anointing you have such a great testimony people on the outside they know you bride of Christ they know you believe of the message but then now in the secret place when nobody knows what's going on then the challenge comes into play just as brother Steven said it on Sunday it's like you know character is shaped when you are alone right and here now he find himself all alone with the little children but what I'm saying innocent children the challenge is coming and standing up is said like you know we have a Ministry I am a deacon in the church I have this title in the church but then before issues before problems before this Temptations quickly we lose our positions the angel of the Lord the Angel and the commission you remember Elisha young fellow went baldheaded was young when he was young man some little children begin to holler said old bold old old bald head where didn't you go up with Elijah sometimes people know where to put to pin yeah where like you know to step on your toes yeah you know you come to church everything is cozy but then by the time you get in the car did you hear that the pastor preached you today I just came from church can you just give me the time to meditate on the word then he find himself already now challenged by Powers innocent people sometimes the pastor is innocent doesn't know what's going on in what's whose life what is who is doing what and things but then it comes to start touching places then we get mad with the innocent pastor we get mad with him you can preach on that oh I spoke with brother such because brother SE is on on the council board that means like he's the one who surely told the pastor you can see the Mind Barrow right right amen you can see what's going on in people's mind despite of the word restore in people's life despite being given a Shalom that you are the bride despite giving all the guarantee that you have not done it to begin with but then on the field the person find himself losing the battle we find ourself losing the ground knowing how to work when all these situations face us because when we are called to be the bride is not to keep the title bride but called to become wife right because Ruth was not given the six measure of B for her to remain just Ruth after the Reapers but was to go into the house and give forth children but here now Elisha with his ministry with the innocent people that he is supposed to deal with is start cursing them he start destroying the very element the very very prophecy that was given to him to fulfill this is the same way that we saw with Martin Luther he was supposed to understand these things but then the Lord is showing they say hey look he started kissing he started cursing the people he said like you know tush ran off the woods and killed the PE the children is that right that's not the nature of the Holy Spirit right that's not the nature of the holy spirit because the holy ghost in the soul right is the nature of the spirit but now when now we find such a condition in our lives you can talk to me I have more experience than you I've been preaching this message for so long you know brother Bram also says why because the places that the holy spirit is addressing in the church we holding on to it we like to stay there longer rather than moving and understanding that we are not in the position of the Bride anymore but we have to bring forth children and these children because Jesus after being there being anointed going into the Wilderness came and went into prayer prayed all night and came and started selecting the disciples because when William Brenham was given the commission was not for him to go sit down but was given to him to go and start going and finding the bride and Elisha also is also anointed in the same manner for him not to sit down you say like you know oh I I I can go out there and and preach the word and and serve the Lord in the in the capacity that he has given me you know I don't really like that sister I don't like that brother no because now this is adoption this is not Church attendance right we come to church and we listen to the word and we go out no but here now Elisha is in the position that I'm coming to church what is my position Lord that's what am I doing I am filled with the Holy Ghost I know all these quotations left and right what am I doing and now in the capacity of your adoption the challenge comes into to play he said what was that you know but that was a that was that but that Prophet was angry see you have to be careful what you do you think that there the nature of the Holy Spirit no sir but that Prophet was anger he had power to do that he could curse those children if he wanted to he could take the we could take it or leave it do you believe that and Jew with people who are gifted from God sure it is yeah the prophet is showing look at how these people in their condition look at the bride in their condition that she is endured with power from on high but this power in the wrong hands can cause a lot of Damages in the Kingdom amen no wonder Jesus gave the key to heaven to men not the key to hell because we've this hanger issues you play with me you go to hell you play with me you go to hell but then when now with all this anger issues it's hard for us to send anybody in heaven it's hard on human being to do so right you look at the children like I don't want to see you alive and not saying I hope you burn in hell that's human nature that's not the nature of the Holy Spirit but yet this is the person ured with power from on ey that's why Paul said I have to Die daily I have to watch the places that I'm walking into because at this level of responsibility given unto me is not a place to come and destroy guys children that's right that's why the prophet said we shall be surprised of how many people we shall see over there why are we surprised because of our nature the way another sister she won't make it they know another brother he won't make it why human nature despite of all everything that we we were we were given hey you are the bride you have eaten the book take the book and eat the book become the book prophesize to many nations bring them in instead of bringing them in what do we do we cast them out cut the fellowship brother what kind of ministry Elisha what kind of ministry but then when we understand our position then now our mind is focused in strengthening those who are weak that's right then the mistakes of our brothers and sisters become an opportunity to work yes because we have to labor on the wall from the rising of the sun until the stars appear but then as human beings we don't like that you believe it or you reject it make your choice that's human nature it's like you know we are ured with power from another but then the Bible says Philippian Philippians 4 4:10 but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at the last at the last your care of me have flourished again wherein ye are ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity not that I speak in respect of one for I have learned in whatsoever state I am right there with to be content Amen elasia in such a condition because when the Temptation come in sh or form father mother preacher whatever you we are we have to learn to be in a position to be content with whatsoever faces us yeah amen because when we see communism among us some of us we start not crying and say like you know oh we need to cut them off and or we claiming we start blaming others and or we start finding all kind of excuses and things but he said no I learn in whatever condition either I am received either I am rejected in whatsoever condition that I'm in I learn to be content right not because that if I do that now people will respect me no it's because I understand my position I understand the responsibility that I am carrying because the thing Jesus in his program is not just like you know seven sales this you know the son of men that left and right then when we come it it applies to our lives we loseing we cutting corners and we cheating left and right and we talking all kind of nonsense behind the back and all these things come on because it is a responsibility what you saying behind there killing people whatam says it's not just like you know stabbing somebody but killing the influence it is a responsibility yeah because that is adoption yeah if it's just a child that is growing we understand oh that's a teenager you understand teenagers how they behave but then when you are mature right when you are adopted when you are married you're not a walkie talkie my husband this my husband that is here because the third pool is a secret speech unknown and unheard of men only those who go inside are able to understand the language and when they go inside is not to become out baren right you can get in and come out Barren and when you come out you have to be pregnant and don't give us don't give us a still born Ministry because the ministry to grow because the word was in Mary and fruitful coming out and now Jesus when they see the ministry say bless areou because adoption it's not about putting it in 1963 adoption is understanding who I am my position what am I doing and what are the challenges I'm facing in my Ministry and how do I deal with that Ministry because we find ourselves quickly we losing Sympathy for the people we become so hard but what I'm saying it's because of lack of water planting the vine where to plant it you planting the in the wilderness that leaf will Spin and will roll down and become his thing but then you put it in a very fruitful ground with enough water then you have enough Shadow to bring people under your fellowship right because adoption is not about brother I'm Sav I'm Sav brother I'm sa my husband said my brother said but then take what your husband said and put into application yes yeah that's dress the way your husband wants you to dress right MH walk the way that the word wants you to walk right yes appear the way the word wants you to appear right and if it doesn't make sense go to your maker yes what have you called me for I've called you to dress this way but God's grace will see that into the Tabernacle how the Lord came down with his vision said I need the clothing of the Tabernacle to stand this way and I have called people of such tribe Tri people of such Ministry people of such capacity for them to be able to fulfill this work of the ministry but here now it says I know both how to abase I know how to abound everywhere everywhere everywhere and all in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to bound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me because the bride is facing this challenge he saying brother Bram he's showing us that Elijah in this Elisha in this condition he find himself looking into the Unseen looking at the children looking at the condition say like you know what am I going to do how am I going to deal with this Pam says it's because I did lost the feeling for the People by the minute that we start losing the love for the word because the bride is the word then we start destroying the word right I don't like that sister I don't like that church that Pastor didn't preach it correctly I am the one who have the Revelation who are you fighting against the bride who are we going against the church which church because Revelation says come out of her my people and now we are called to minister to the bride and as we are ministering to the bride how are we dealing with the challenges that we are facing Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him and that's how the church is that's how that's those are the challenges that God has chosen to put in our pathway through adoption because if we don't face those challenges then we are just walking with the devil if I amam says if I go longer without any Temptation in my life I have to ask the Lord what's going on and the church doesn't like it I come to the Lord everything has to be hallelujah amen hallelujah amen but it is not so because it started with Jesus after praying he was tempted he started with William Bram with Moses the same he came to the people he thought the people would understand sure what are we facing in our lives for us who are adopted yeah not just preaching the word not just saying that you know the message the revelation of the hour what are we facing and how are we dealing with it are we like David we go and we say like you know I'm the king and nobody will tell me anything you go you Tex somebody's wife and when they come they reproach you then you start passing up it's say you know we have to apply the fullness of the word and then when they tell you that's you it's you the Deacon of the house it's you in your house it's you in yourself it's your life of prayer that you've neglected you've set time into so many other things amen because after this remember you know the Bible that after this Elisha has so many more things to do yes amen we have the record that when we see William Bram after departing from the from the Baptist he has a whole long journey to go it's not a smooth ride amen it is a bumpy one and thank God for the bumps on the road sometimes it is a trap setting there you walk your path as a young lady as a young man as a minister whatsoever you are in all our positions we find ourselves facing the same issues yes each one of us oh I have to be submit H submissive to this man all the rest of my life what have I done why should I listen to him according to the IQ I have more High higher IQ than him but you chose him right you went to prayer now you wake up now you find him that he doesn't like to shower in the morning I'm not saying this for jokes I'm saying this to realize the responsibility that he is setting before us I thought you were brother I thought you were spiritual I thought you were this all over the message we see how men and women and people into all kind of chaos brother BR my my wife doesn't listen to me he I you need to cast down the demon it's like you just don't know how to work many of us don't know how to work we put the church into so much tension into the the children like you know Deering dad that is like you know a lion in the house but then when we start seeing the revelation of who we are that as the Martin Luther King of my house with such an anointing upon me the anointing brings a Shalom it doesn't bring fear he said be not afraid it is Daddy be not afraid it is Mommy with a such a loving atmosphere when the ministers coming with in a fellowship with the brothers and sisters such a anointing with the Holy Ghost comes down the word start pouring forth but it's like this brother is here again brother says there are people they live a good life but you just can't stand the atmosphere you just can't be around them yeah it's not that they are bad people it's just the atmosphere that we are producing we want to show off that we are the most spiritual one we want to show off like you know we are the one that that the Lord has given all the Revelation but it's saying like you know it's because we have lost the love for the people and now I cannot go with a Ministry like that brother bam is saying until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God did tell me but that is but that uh but that is that change that brother Roy that see coming something got to change me because in my heart heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that the way I to have heard the message they had to have done it and I and I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I can get that feeling there is no need for me going because I'd be an hypocrite this is the prophet of the hour this is not you know the average believer in the church he found himself in that position Moses found himself in that position Elisha finds himself in that position right and the times we find ourself in that position we lose the love for the people we lose the love of being in such a fellowship like this now our love if we don't have the love for the church our love will be turned somewhere else we'll be turning it to pornography to Lasting to money to popularity to all kind of things and the prophet is showing us now how to deal with it he said no no no no no something must change me amen something must happen in here because God's program must go on because we are called onto such a great call because we understand my position there's no time to waste yes because this is 63 2 years the man is gone right how much time do we have left some of us 30 years we are living you get married young you give birth to Children before you know it they packing you quick and you gone we may say like you know well my Ministry oh I'm still young I'm still strong I'm still old this year but the appointed time on Earth is so limited and the work must be done quick and effectively and when we are doing it effectively now we need to be aware of these things how am I dealing how how am I dealing with my wife children my church my tithes my offerings and all these things right because all these elements God has given us such call he said that you're stealing from me imagine marrying a wife who steals from you you pull your bank account and the money is gone what happened you know I went shopping really you don't know the program you don't look you don't look at the budget it is the same program but I'm breaking it down to some level for some others because if she's unable to hold all her desires and all these things into position bringing it into subjection as the Paul is saying that you know I know both how to be to be abased and I know how to abound right if we don't know how to abound in all these places we last full I need this buy this and buy that buy product byy product then the whole program of God is coming crumbling down as I was telling a brother say brother look at how God the place the way God has blessed you is for you to be available when he needs you say I never thought of it like I say yes let's understand our lives the position God puts us into it's not just for church attendance my business and all this no God gives us all these blessings and position and beauty and Capa abilities and knowledge and understanding of all these things for a specific purpose yes and now in this time when we find ourselves say hey we have lost the feeling for the people and all these Year all these years I've tried to serve him that to serve him and with with a TR and I won't go out I I want go out there being being an hypocrite I got to feel that that isn't Ricky and Retta that isn't this church it's God's children that's in bondage that I must go to innocent children that Elisha is dealing with they said like go so these people in these conditions skirt here issue hair there's issue Nails it's an issue here stubbl there disease on the other side now I need to understand how to work with these people but then for me to be able to help them something must happen inside I can't just be an anointed person with quotations and label of the message but this is a adopted son who goes out and start now what should I do for this children who are in bondage because remember Genesis 14 when he heard that his BR his uh nephew was in in bondage it took all the man who grew up in his house it took all the love it took all the helmet he took all the breastplate he took the sword it said like you know hey I have to go after him or I can be contempt and saying like you know oh one one Abraham equals 100 Lots I am good I'm not in Sodom really is that your position but no not Abraham the Seed of Abraham understand the work seeing Jesus and his program it's not about you know brother Bram here brother Bram did this year revelation of the son of man where is he revealed that in 63 because he's here 63 showing us that I must go after these people the people are in bondage yes there must be an internal evangelism in areas that people need to be strengthened upon in areas that we are becoming aware of the issues among us because the Lord wants his Tabernacle to be built in a certain fashion in a certain manner because Alpha must come to Omega amen we understand that in between the Holy Ghost was bound yes but then in this hour when the Holy Ghost is set loose what do we do sit down and criticize us we becoming aware who are we what are we doing yes what are we supposed to do and how we supposed to do it and if we are called to be adopted Sons and Daughters then our position we must reflect it in our lives first leave me that sermon before you preach it to me what kind of atmosphere do you have when you bring to church I pray that by you oh Vivid are you ready to come to church because I am happy when they say unto me let's go into the house of the Lord amen I will not stay home when I know that the door of the church is open am right I have to be there I have to bring my share yes right unless if you in a mission the Lord has send you like Phillip you know leave the congregation here go there there's somebody there down the road you need to help right adopted Sons not Church attendance church attendance is numbers but says then you become like we become like uh uh luk one Believers says they are worse than unbelievers right I'll just go to church I'll just listen I'll just stand here no we need to be present active doing exactly what God has called us to do am that's right amen because the anointing is not about speaking about it yesterday the day I got married oh my wedding was this I was telling my sister say how many people remembers your wedding how much of that feeling of the wedding is happening now but then look at the experience that you're getting with raising the children preparing the sermon being into prayer pulling from the minister Lord address this part here of my life so I can be able to still keep working otherwise we are a bunch of communist in the church calling ourselves Martin Luther King you know leaders and I have a dream dream have a vision have the program work according to the program Luke 22 it said and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan have desired to uh to have you that he may see you as we because in this position that's what the devil does in the work of our ministry that's what the devil is doing right he wants to destroy us so quick because he knows what kind of power we are anointed with because when he said that it is not the disciples that did the work but it was I in the disciples it is the same way is the same yesterday today and forever and if it's to them the same yesterday today and forever the devil knows that I can let these people do the work let me bring division among them let me bring classes among them remember with Jesus when we spoke about Luke 22 it said like you know he that wants to be the greater do what serve others but then when we lose the feeling then the work of the ministry we just talking now I am bright I am bright I am bright I am bright as we see on the social media you know a very big diamond and stuff but she doesn't know how to cook she doesn't know how to clean she has long nails like Nebuchadnezzar crazy she can sit still this is the condition that Leia put us into but the Lord said I also have witnesses and here are the witnesses amen he is the bride that when Queen Esther she's not coming there like you know like V beauty beauty beauty there from morning to morning selfie here Instagram right uh Snapchat left all these things here no she said like you no no no no no no I understand mod say like you know hey understand that you are brought in this time for a purpose come on because there's there's an agenda coming out for destruction of the old church it said like you know you are married brought into the palace for a specific purpose don't go out there and following dress this and you know beautiful this yes like no no no no no this is how you access to the king you need to get to the king quickly because n man wants a skilled all Let It Be Democrats Let It Be Republican Let It Be communism let it be whatever that is because the seven Vision shows this whole land into ashes amen yes that's right and he's making a way he said that he said that you know I'm making a way the Escape through Rapture but then for those people to come out I'm giving you the responsibility to go do that work and when we become conscious of this type of work none of us in the church church will just come to church and walk out out of after service each one of us have a position to fill prayer warriors cleaners sound Engineers videos and everybody interpreters everybody in the post of Duties in season out of season always ready because this is seeing Jesus I'm not saying church members I'm not looking at people just sitting in the pews right I'm seeing Jesus am and his program Elisha's Ministry being fulfilled in this hour because afterward we see elishah bringing forth the child back to life we see Elijah removing the poison out of the food rightly dividing the word amen I see Elijah sitting under Elisha's Ministry understanding how to get to get access in of the word we preach on these things access to the word Elisha's ministry under under under uh uh under Elisha this great vision because we are so much acquainted in the message seven SE then we say like yes that's really the word brother you preach the son of man today but this is the son of man in Simplicity this is the son of man reconciling those loose hands placing those places bringing the picture of the puzzle together that if I'm putting if my picture in my mind is come to church listen to the word and then go back home and all these things you no that's like painting the picture and you have a a uh a cow eating on on the tree you can't be there just like you know God no God saw me just sitting on the pews no that's nonsense nowhere in the scripture nowhere in the scriptures you can marry a wife and all she does she's just sitting there come on you can't give me children you can't cook me some food you can't sit under Elisha's Ministry and said make B me the the cake first right you only have your own priorities work and my my project and after after church I'm gone I don't shake nobody's hands I don't fellowship with nobody and all this year what are you afraid of I'm talking the word I'm showing Elisha working in his ministry right because if I'm coming coming like like Peter and John and say like you know hey brother what's your need I am healed I'm suffering let me pray for you brother let me pray for you sister enact your Ministries put it to Value right go visit somebody go talk to people you never spoke to before right instead of just going in your little click somewhere open up a bit and see how Joseph Ministry starts springing from going over the walls not just the limit that you're giving yourself very good either you are well spoken bad spoken halfway spoken get into the word because the prophet was found himself in the same position he said like you know hey you know I I don't speak very good English he said like you know people don't need that people just need you to speak and the Holy Spirit Come and transfer the word amen he said like really yeah that's how it is the work of the ministry adoption it's not just saying keep saying what you want on seven sell this seven sell that but then when the Lord is looking at you so I married you just to say seven seven SE seven s not doing anything right because he wants to see the linage because he shall see his pedigree and he wants to see the pedigree coming forth because his wife has to be a fruitful Vine around his table he must have children sitting at his table he is a young man with the quiver with full of arrows he wants to send us into places he wants to have ministers he wants to say have singers right amen but then when we just want to find ourself in a cozy environment you know I never been in such a place you know I'm afraid I'll just stay in the church and you know I won't do this here I won't visit anybody because I I don't want any problems this is part of the believer right am it is given to us in that position 2 Corinthians 4:7 verse 8 we are troubled on every side yet not yet no uh yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of our Lord Jesus we under we have the understanding that the blood cell that was broken up has sent out aive yeah and in the midst of all the Despair and all the challenges and everything that we go through the ministry must go on the work must go on we must do it always bearing in the in about the dying of our of the of the in the body of the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in the prophet's body no in our body amen because Jesus said the Bible said the prophet says Jesus didn't finish everything that's right he says he left the part of the suffering a portion for you a portion for me that's why at the cross said he didn't say all is finished he says it is finished is portion of the work was finished and we Doo have a portion and each one of us that's right we can fulfill our portion of the scripture if we have not set under Elijah that's why I read it last sermon that that to become the last voice to the last age we must say under the prophet of the a am you can't dep we depart from the prophet what are we going to fulfill our own ideas yeah because the program was given to Elijah he say Elijah go anoint Elisha a prophet in thy stad we anointed to take the what the prophet has left us for us to fulfill another message no fulfilling the message applying the message is life was a wave sheave unto us an example how to receive the Holy Ghost how to deal with these things here to close up yeah he found himself in the church he's preaching and the two young people they start going and playing in the church say like you know hey stop that no they can't listen stop that they can't listen stop that they can't listen they voice say say what you will amen that opportunity given to some of us we can turn them into servants you know it's like to show I am the man of God let the fire come down and consume both of you but then the holy ghost ahead of time is say like you know hey watch a trap is on your way God is putting these children of God in conditions and places in which it pushes us to our end I've told you my son I've told you my daughter we don't dress this way we don't walk this way we don't talk this way and this is how you recompense me all the work that I've done all the sermons that's human nature but then when we become acquainted we we are aware of our ministry it's said like no no it's not about title you know preacher Deacon and all these things here but when I'm say Hey you are just like me if you were converted 5 minutes ago God is looking us at the same pedestal of course some some of us are called Elders because of the journey their journey in the world but then before God you are all Sons right different positions but then when the prophet wanted to go out then calling them Rick and stop if he did that with him what shall he do with us the same thing and then when we are aware then we have to go above Beyond ourself get over our own ideas and be able to embrace God's program and said like you know Lord give me the opportunity give me the opportunity to see the one who hurts me the most is the one that I'll stay in prayer for right the one who doesn't show up to church is the one that will become my friend why because I have a life that I can transmit to him because Jesus walked and the limb walked Peter and John came to the door and excuse me find one who was a for 38 years right and the anointing upon them he said like you know gold and money and and anything we have none but such as we have we give it to you the man didn't go home he went to church yes amen apply this in all those areas he didn't go outside the Bible said he went into the temple rejoicing God Amen the child who doesn't listen the wife who doesn't listen the husband who doesn't want to come to church after your anointing is poured upon them then we are brought into the word that's right adoption elious Ministry is not something about church attendance we'll preach about the son of man we'll preach about the Revelation we'll preach about the ministry but at the end of the day the Lord said what did you do with the talent that I give to you oh Lord you know I'm I'm I'm uh I don't like to take I'm I don't like to take risk you know I went and hide myself under the blanket like you know I know nothing and I don't need any problem he said like you know take that away from him even what he doesn't have and give to others right and he's calling us all right each one of us to labor if this can make sense in our mind can be this clear in our mind that means that the Lord has a work for us to do right in whatever position but it has to be according to God's program right otherwise we going about like you know oh you know I'll go and you know start to become such a person and stuff not lawful to be said here on the pulpit I hope you understand the language these places that the Lord is calling us onto is it benefiting your program or God's program very because many times like you know I feel I like to do this I feel like musician if you can can come I feel like I I want to do this you know my life and you know my choice and all these things here your life your choice right you think so right very good are you the bride or are you a free woman are you under leadership under that leadership you do things you want you do what he says because one of his wishes is what our Command is our Command it may seem to be hard King you want us to go get the water of of Bethlehem don't you see the Philistines don't you see this don't you see that Moses Go free my people I can speak you know right all kind of excuses but he said no when I send I don't send you alone amen Lord I Am With You Yes amen even in you yes all the way in that day this day you shall know that I am in the Father the father in me the son do with nothing except he sin what done by the father according to what vision we're running around and not fulfilling God's purpose because we think that you know it's better for us to go make that much money or do you think you can make it better than Elon Musk don't you think that God has limited your life to a certain area a certain income a certain ability for a certain purpose right amen it's not by chance that's right I know at times we look at ourselves we say like you know why can't I just be like everybody else why can't I just like you know go and dress and speak with anybody have boyfriend and girlfriend but he said defile not your body right MH because when you grow I have a work for you to do yes that's the program MH and when we come to the program let's remember let's not lose the love for these people amen because this is the people that you're avoiding here on Earth that you have to spend eternity with that's right and if we can spend 2 three hours in Fellowship how we going to spend eternity good right that already tells I I mean I have to be honest with myself if I find myself in that position you know I'm avoiding the brothers I'm avoiding the sisters that means that you know my fellowship is somewhere else because the Sheep always stay together in the same F in the same uh uh uh Folk andam says in the time of heat the shadow of one covers the other yes in the time of Co of cold the warmth of the other uh hits the other we are called to stand as one one body One Faith God's problem is not an intellectual thing right it is a lifestyle reality yes it is a way of living yes it's not just walkie talkie walkie talkie it is a fulfillment of the prophecy amen because when Mary went to Elizabeth she didn't go there with a dead son in his own bosom in her own bosom but she went with life he said how come the man of my Lord that when you just spoke then the sun came to life what is our ministry fulfilling yeah then we have not to take it we have not to check ourselves right and said what do I have what am I giving right criticism when I'm with the brothers did you see the way she she dressed today that's nonsense raise the standard higher work in the ministry in those places and the Lord wants to see the bride serving him in his Temple and this is the temple yes may the Lord bless you amen amen amen let's stand together you know I've always wanted to preach on second Kings chapter 2 on Old bald head not because but you begin to look at this now Bible examples are given to you for real life examples now here is Elisha who has gotten the mantle of Elijah who has got a double portion right and there are times times in your life when the anointing has left you and somebody criticizes you and brother Brenham said it was not the holy spirit in Elisha to curse those children and took 42 of their lives he said that was an angry Propet right any of you ever had the anointing of God on you and and then a day or two later it's not there huh and you run from Jezebel brother renom said those immature children where did they learn their disrespect from the parents around the table Lord help us the Bible says the tongue is an unruly member who can yes that's true God help us to Bridle our tongue quit criticizing others yes because they'll come a time Hey listen the devil don't come around you when you're anointed he knows you cut his head off but when you're yeah you're just being carnal that day natural that day and so oh bald head oh Baldhead yeah you come here come here kid [Music] an angry Prophet God showing you examples of a man with a double portion of the spirit of Elijah yeah found in a position where he he was out of sorts how about elishah or Elijah when uh you know one of the Kings said hey I I'd like a word of the Lord yeah I don't even want to talk to you but because you hang around son so you know what right now I'm not in the mood bring me a Minstrel how many of you remember that yeah bring me a Minstrel right now I'm not in the spirit yeah any of you ever been there God help us we see biblical examples of a great man of God I want to ask you you know you that know the message brother Bram said in all of the great anointing of the ministry of Elijah how many miracles did he do four in all the years of his ministry four Mir four Miracles he said and Elijah with a double portion did eight but we're talking years we're not talking you know uh a three-month Ministry we're talking a years of ministry right you know a lot of times we want the the big uh you know Mount carals and let me tell you when Elijah had killed all of those false prophets and he was so anointed he ran to go preach his sermon to Jezebel thinking she she would repent and guess what she said you know what tomorrow you'll be as those those ones that you killed the anointing is off him guess what he did he run into the Wilderness ran another Marathon and cried before God and right oh God take my life I'm the only [Music] one right showing you Bible examples and I like this because you know what it does it shows you there are times listen my brother my sister when the anointing is not going to be upon you yes we don't serve God just because we're anointed but because we have a [Music] vision yes be careful when the anointing is not there right and you're out of sorts and somebody's pressing your button old bald head right yeah come here buddy see what I'm saying how many of you know what I'm talking
