we're getting our trials these hard trials we go through sometimes sometimes we got to realize that we need to get so distressed so Jesus can take over you know when you take that Rosebud if you try to unfold a rosebud by yourself you make a mess of it but when that Rosebud gets in the right soil gets in the right weather the heat then it starts unfolding and it becomes a beautiful rose if we let God take over he'll he'll make everything right [Music] thank you [Music] thank you there have been times when I thought my prayers didn't even reach the ceiling of the room where I knelt to pray and a voice inside kept asking me did I think God was really listening do anything that I had to say what I kept on praying and Holding On by faith knowing god is always in control and I waited like a Rosebud in the garden [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] God knows when to hold on and the perfect time to let go so let him have his way [Music] and watch God unfold The Rose there are trials and tribulations we must all go through when it comes the heartaches we've all had our share but when times are the heart is we need to hold on to the promise steady never give us more than we could bear it's all keep on a Praying and Holding On by faith no one in God is working all things for my good and I'll wait just like a Rosebud in the garden God who can unfold The Rose [Music] when God unfolds the road [Music] he always yes it rides when the petals are in place oh such a beautiful sight thank you God knows when to hold on and a perfect time to let go [Music] so let him have his way and watch God unfold the rules when God unfolds the rose he always gets it right when a petals are in place [Music] oh such a beautiful side God knows when to hold on [Music] and the perfect time to let go so let him have his way please and what's God unfold the road foreign God knows when to hold on and a perfect time to let go so let him have his way [Music] and watch God unfold The Rose [Music]

needs among your people father but you are a god that meets every one of our needs so therefore father we come unto you this morning with faith believing Lord that you will meet every Challenge and everything that comes across our path for we know that you are truly Jehovah Jireh father God I just commit the service now into thy hands I ask you to bless your people in a special way bless your servant Lord as I desire to show the people more about you I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen turn around Shake somebody's hand say God bless you we're happy to have you in the house of the Lord this morning all of you each and every one God bless you you can be seated amen they had a youth meeting over there at the Wallace Ranch uh yesterday and I want to say thank you to brother Russell and sister Elizabeth for them opening their home and their Ranch there and the kids and they all had a good time and so I appreciate it now you all notice we have a new pulpit and uh I'm a little bit sentimental because the other one was from the very beginning and everything but we know that even brother Branham uh when he had his first pulpit and remember the old Pulpit that was there that during the time the flood and it it rose up still had to Bible on top come back down in the same spot and everything and yet when um uh later they remodeled the Tabernacle uh brother Banks Woods went ahead and made him uh a new pulpit and so um yeah this one's uh big I'll have to do a little bit more walking they probably go around it it is the right height the brothers I think Ethan Strayer said brother Ron I hope it's the right night I said if it's not I'm gonna have to get after the guy that told him how tall it would be and that was me so no it it fits it it works it's it's good and I appreciate it and um uh listen uh I wanted to go ahead before we actually go on with the the service here because the pulpit is to be a very special place now you all remember that this Bible was under the pulpit of the original Pulpit back on Maryland and to just let you know that the Bible was open when we went into the church just to look at it and it was open to Matthew and it says he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and as I read that the Holy Spirit came down as all of you well most all of you will know some of her visitors don't the Holy Spirit came down and anointed me in the Pulpit with this Bible with this word and I said God has given us this church and we know the testimony of what God has done and God has not only provided that church but he's provided even a place when we were on 51st Avenue the school because we needed a bigger place and now he's provided this and uh I am so thankful to God and I would like some of the ministers and I would like some of the deacon Brethren James love all different ones would you Brethren come up here I want to lay hands on this and bless this sanctify this Pulpit for the word that will come forth from this pulpit brother Warren where are you yeah come on up here yeah if you Minister the word come up here just stand here with me because I think it's important didn't they sanctify the vessels in the Tabernacle amen so we do the same thing just come up here brother and around here that's fine come up yes thank you brother Mike each and every one I'd like you brother and along with me you put your hands out here onto this pulpit and let's lay our hands on it and I would like to ask God to sanctify it Heavenly Father Lord God as we have this new Pulpit here father I pray o God it's not the pulpit but it's the god of the pulpit it is the god of the congregation father anoint this pulpit and may whoever stands behind it feel that anointing as they come behind the veil I pray o God that the word will go forth from behind this public without fear or favor I pray o God that it will circumcise the heart of every individual that comes in here Lord and I pray May there be such an illumination and a revelation that would emanate forth from this Pulpit because you are the god of the pulpit you are the god of the congregation father we lay our hands on it and we bless it now for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you thank you brethren amen I wanted to do that God bless you thank you also uh we have an announcement there's an engagement

Isaiah 53 God bless you brother Ezra I see you have a patch over your eye God bless you amen I pray that God will heal that eye and completely restore it back brother completely restore it back amen Isaiah 53. who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as it root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no Beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed [Music] all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was suppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is done dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living and for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked in the with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand and he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied and by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the Great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors can you all say Amen to that he was stricken smitten of God and afflicted turn with me one more portion of scripture Ephesians chapter 2. Ephesians 2 10-14 Ephesians chapter 2. verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them remember wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of the promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye are sometime ye who were sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of Christ Hallelujah he is our peace who hath both made one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of God amen I want to title my sermon this morning the flawed masterpiece and I want to take a subject of the flaw was what made it the masterpiece I've been studying and reading the other day and I was reading about perfection and how that we are made perfect by being in Christ and during my studies as I was reading from the sermon the masterpiece he came across a sentence that just absolutely struck me and I'm sure all of you have had times wherein you're reading your Bible you're reading the message of the hour you're just going along and all of a sudden you read something that gets your attention that absolutely quickens you and sometimes the prophet of God said when you take a sermon he said actually what God does is he gives a thought and around that thought he begins to add more thoughts but the whole sermon is around one Central thought and so I wish to share with you this sentence that just absolutely stood out to me and I want to build my sermon around that and that's the reason that I have said I call this the flawed masterpiece in the sermon the Masterpiece in 1964 brother Brahm says after he spent all that time he's speaking about Michelangelo right now and he's typing it even unto God for years and years to make this then under the influence of seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his heart and in his vision and desired to see it was completed and when it was completed he was so inspired by it till he thought his own Masterpiece should speak back to him Hallelujah and he struck it across the leg and hollered speak they made a flaw on it they put a flaw on the image to me the flaw was what made it the masterpiece now maybe in the mind you might think different you think that spoiled it no to me it made it what it was so many years of careful work and toils and inspiration and so forth making it his toil had proved not in vain it was perfect that's why he cried out speak because he had seen before him that was had been able to achieve to bring to pass the vision that was in his mind and therefore under inspiration he done something out of out of the reason out of the ordinary he struck it he hollered speak see he wouldn't have done that if he had a thought but he didn't think it was inspiration of seeing what he had in his mind sitting there perfectly before him you see he became so inspired that this Vision that was in his mind now the prophet of God takes you back and he says there I can see Michelangelo he said that great sculptor and they was brought to him a slab of marble it had no shape and form except for just a big block of marble and he said for days he would walk around and he looked at it and he meditated and he thought about it and he walked around it and he was waiting for inspiration and when the inspiration began to strike him he grabbed his hammer and mallet and he began to work and chisel away and the prophet of God said that what he was doing was he was chiseling away everything that was not a part of the vision whoa glory to God that's what he does with every one of you oh when he starts working on you in large chunks begin to fall off and all of that how many of you remember when God got a hold of you and you don't need this and you don't need that and you don't and all of this and God starts setting you free but now as he comes down to the finished work it's now delicate it's very intricate it's not with a big hammer and a chisel now it might be just a small file or a small scrape of something a tool in his hand and the vision now became so perfectly before him until after years and years of his work was there perfectly as it was in his mind his vision now was before him and he wasn't thinking about it he got so inspired he stepped into his vision and he spotted and it was the smiting of the image that made it the masterpiece now I want to take this and I want to tell you that the flaw that is in the masterpiece is the bride for she is the reason why he became flawed all of us are flawed individuals maybe you haven't figured that out yet maybe you're walking around thinking you're perfect but just give you some time you'll find out that you're imperfect we have all kinds of flaws in our sinful flesh for the Bible says we were born in sin shaped in iniquity we came into the world speaking lies we were flawed from the beginning ever since the fall in the garden we have seen that mankind has become a flawed race there's only one that was born without flaw without blemish there was no sin that became that could be laid to his charge so we can say that the Great Masterpiece of God became Jesus Christ he was The Great Masterpiece that was going to be smitten and afflicted brother Branham continues in the service the Masterpiece now let us turn the page of Michelangelo and close the book and let's open another book and read of the great Sculptor the Almighty who before there was a world before the foundation was laid he had in his mind what he wanted and he wanted to make man in his own image he wanted to make something in a reality of what a vision was to him what was in his thinking so God began to create in the womb of his mind because we all know that the womb is a place of conception it is a place wherein things are formed for the mind is the womb to the spirit brother Branham in the spoken word he's the Original Seed he said now there's a womb of the physical and there's a womb of the spirit do you believe that there is a spiritual room and a physical womb and the mind is the womb to the spirit so but God began to create in the womb of his mind to bring forth a masterpiece something that he had in his thoughts and in his mind before there was Stardust for we know that Jesus the Bible says is the beginning of the creation of God he was the firstborn of God among many brethren he was created first in the mind of God he was first born in the mind of God he was first crucified in the mind of God let's go on now brother Branham says in masterpiece and now to Michelangelo that was an attribute of his thought and God wanted to make a man after his image the great Sculptor and he went to work on him and we notice as he brought up from the materials perhaps from fishes and birds and creeping things on the Earth and many things that he brought but finally as he brewed of being creator he wasn't like a man now a sculptor that was taking something that's been created to a new image he was a sculptor of Eternal things he was the sculptor that could create and bring into existence that which he has in his mind to do or otherwise he can make material what his attributes desired in the womb of God's mind he wanted to be a savior a redeemer A Healer a provider a shepherd he had all of these attributes that God wanted to do but he couldn't do it until he expressed it and when he began to speak and God created by the spoken word from the thoughts of his mind the thoughts spoken became a creative word so we find that the first man that God created was Adam foreign of God of this hour began to tell us what kind of a man was Adam he was a God man he was a spirit man he did not have a body he brewed it over the Earth like the Holy Spirit Broods over the church making itself known Adam was making himself known he was orchestrating over the garden he had authority over it he was a God over it but there was no man to till the soil Genesis 1 man was a spirit man but Genesis 2 God saw that there was no man to till the soil so now he takes Out of the Dust of the earth oh God this great Creator now the calcium and there he takes and he begins to form something he said there he says Adam stood like a tree he said there his branches out his toes like the roots of the tree into the ground and he stood there lifeless there was nothing and God breathed into the nostrils the Breath of Life the spirit of God now hitters and now Adam becomes a living soul the first time that you see a soul a part of God's attribute a part of God himself has now become a living soul in the sermon the Masterpiece let's go on and then I might say to this and that when he made this man there was something about him that didn't look just right because he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself he was the eternal the man now in the image of God also existed on Earth by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on his left side and from there he took the peace that struck off of it and made a helpmate a wife notice he struck the image of Adam then he wasn't by himself he had somebody with him that's his great work God smote at him and put him to sleep struck a piece off of Adam to make him a help me to wife so the smitten flaw of Adam became his help mate she was a byproduct of Adam the prophet of God said she was not in the original creation Adam was made in the image of God but Eve was made in the image of Adam she was not created by taking some dust out of the Earth and blowing the breath of life into her like it was with Adam Eve was created when Adam was smitten in sleep Eve was the peace that was struck off of Adam Adam was smitten to make Eve she was the flaw from the Masterpiece of Adam Adam could not fall Adam could not be deceived but he fell so that Adam could play the part of Christ every Demon's bride Adam could not be complete without Eve Eve cannot be complete without Adam let's go on the masterpiece let us not forget that in the beginning when he smote the sight of Adam he took something from his side the smiting of Christ was for a Cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride he might take him a bride why was Christ smitten what is the flaw that was in the masterpiece that he might take him a bride so when his Masterpiece was perfected then he had to Smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but of the same creation my brother don't think bad at this but think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he never made another creation he took a part of the original creation then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be original word Living God in the word it's the original life the original seat it's the original word that's why that spoken word is the Original Seed that's why you believe it the image of Christ was smitten at Calvary God's Great remedy and Masterpiece for the penalty of sin he was without sin was made sin for us he that was without spots or blemish was slain for our sins watch this now brother Branham goes on we're still in the masterpiece all the prophets had flaws all the ones was apportioned but here at last coming up through that finally comes the Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in his work Grodd and Christ are one Michelangelo rather was a Sculptor work that was dead because it had made of stone out of stone but here the master builder when he got his hand he worked perfected he steps into it oh I love that only a prophet of God could take these things and then there before our wandering eyes show us how that God would make a masterpiece and how he would step into the masterpiece no wonder that God smote him in Calvary and said speak that's what Jesus did he was smitten of God Afflicted he was a man acquainted with grief and sorrow why because it was our sins that put him on the cross it was our flaws that he died for it was our flaws that made him the masterpiece do you understand oh how I love him today [Music] why he became me that I might become him by grace without a flaw there would be no need of a savior without a flaw there would be no need of a redeemer without a flaw of sickness and and things in our lives there would be no need for a Healer you would need no masterpiece in the sermon Hebrews 57 and then there was no man to till the soil Genesis 2. he had done made male and female but there's no man to till the soil then God made Man Out of the Dust of the earth gave him a hand like a chimpanzee give me my foot like a bear he made him on the image this Earthly body is in the image of animal life and it's made out of the same kind of material your body is made up just to the same kind of material a horse or a dog or anything like that it's made out of calcium potash petroleum Cosmic light All Flesh like that is not the same flesh it's different flesh but it's made out of the Dust of the Earth where it come from the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany let that sink down chew on that a while one day I'm going to take a step why do you like that song not because it's got a beat not be no because there's truth to it now listen to this brother Branham said the serpent had no soul he had a place for a soul nowhere there's only two quotes where brother Brown said the serpent had a place for a soul but it says he had no soul now Lucifer had a soul and the soul that sinneth that Soul shall die are you understanding so now Lucifer he enters into a body that is a beast body it's an animal body has no soul but it's so close it is the missing link between man and Beast now the prophet of God says now you watch he says you take away the spirit of God on a man and he's nothing but a brute Beast oh you call him a gentleman he says that same man would ravish a woman throw her her child against the wall ravish her and be like a brute Beast he said he might be 250 pound muscles and everything and not announce a man any and I'll tell you what that's being played out in this day let me tell you have all kinds of these muscle men and everything and what they are they're nothing but a bunch of queers perverted fleshly brute beasts serpent did not have a soul so it takes a man to be born again to take away the carnal lustful nature that we were born with you don't have to teach a little child to sin it's their nature you don't have to teach him how to to to be Bob to to music put on any kind of a music in front of a little baby who's never heard it before white black red it don't matter you put that beat before him and pretty soon yeah I Was Born to Boogie that's because of the nature huh that's because of the nature of your first husband which had a rule over you he was your nearer Kinsman oh do you understand because man fell in the flesh there was a nearer Kinsman who was it Lucifer who had control or came in and he interjected seed and do that Godly race and when it did it mixed the seed all down Through the Ages Eve was the byproduct that was made with a flaw so that the Masterpiece would have a purpose cause the very reason for him to be a masterpiece was because there was somebody who had a flaw and he said I need to be Jehovah Jireh there are people that have no peace I am Jehovah shalom there are people that have no righteousness I become Jehovah their righteousness do you see and I want all of you to understand that the seven Redemptive compound names of Jehovah every time you have a situation you can reach up and pull huh one of the pull down tabs of God's Great computer of his eternal thoughts and pull down I need some peace Hallelujah I need some peace so therefore I can pull on Jehovah shalom in the midst of my trials and tribulation I have a peace that passes all understanding I need a shepherd and we like sheep of gold gone astray therefore I can call on Jehovah he is my shepherd every sheep needs a shepherd without the flaws of all of God's children there would be no need for a masterpiece it is that need it is that flaw it is that failure that brought about the masterpiece that's why brother Branham said it was the flaw that made it the masterpiece oh do you know this masterpiece you who are flawed in your body with your temper and your complexes and your all of your kind of issues the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and the the lust of the eye and all of these things do you know that Masterpiece that when you are having a time of trouble and trials in your life that you can look to him the Masterpiece and he what's bruised for your iniquity he was he was chastised for your peace by his stripes [Applause] [Music] you were healed the Bible says Romans 3 23 for all have sinned they should come short of the glory of God all have sinned you were born into it Romans 6 23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through the masterpiece Romans 5 verses 12 through 21 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin was not imputed when there was when there is no law nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come but not as the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for judgment was come was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive the abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ oh the power of one brother Branham said you with him become the majority the power of one Verse 18 therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all man to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one of the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's Disobedience many were made sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous I'm over the law entered and the offense might have bound but when where sin abounded Grace did much more abound that in sin hath reigned unto death even so might the grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord because one sinned all became sinners and because one obeyed all became righteous death to self separates you from your first Kinsmen not a divorce you don't just put him away but a death is what separates you from your first husband because even in your vows you say unto death do we part now watch this brother Branham takes a sermon called The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ the invisible you somebody say invisible it's in a supernatural Realm now he says your first husband that had rule over you was your Nature by natural birth natural you love the world because you are the world and part of the world that's right your desires was by nature to love the world which you're a part of you're part of nature you believe that that's a natural thing that's a reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to your first husband you can't live with it you just can't say well I'll divorce him hang him up till the another occasion no writing a divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every Speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature now if your first husband had rule over you and that was by Nature now if he ain't going to die until he's thrown into the Lake of Fire and he's done away with then you don't give him no writing of of divorcement there's still got to be a death because you are united to him until death so who's going to die he who seeks to save his life shall lose it but he who seeks to lose his life shall find it is that right so now you understand the only thing that separates you from your first union now young people and some of you older ones if you've never had the new birth I want you to understand you can teach the young people knowledge of God you can teach young people things about God you can teach them they can sing the songs Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so they can go to Sunday school class they can learn of the a burning bush they can learn about Moses they can learn all of this they can go to church they can become a church member they can sit there and and feel the anointing of God and still not know him you must be born again the natural carnal life out of a kid I'll tell you what you were that kind of thing again I'll beat you out just nah you know what a child that is often reproved and rebuked hardened his neck don't you tell me and tell you what I just can't wait until I get out of here no wonder some of our kids are having such a rebellious spirit because Mom and Dad you don't beat it out of them oh yeah you bring him to church you pray and you seek God that one day they'll have an experience with God and the old Jacob nature we changed and he'll become Israel and saints of God I want you to understand every one of you know ye not you must be born again because to be carnally mind is is enmity with God neither can you know the things of God therefore Marvel not Nicodemus when I tell you a man must be born again how is it do I enter back into my mother's womb no that which is born of the flesh is flesh but that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not ye when I say A man must be born again even with the new birth you're not completely rid of this old carnal man Paul said I've got to crucify him on a daily basis Romans 7 verses 18 through 25 I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good things for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do and if you ever had that I find in a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inner man but I see another law a law in my members worrying against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I think God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin the Holy Ghost baptism is only the earnest of your inheritance you do not get the fullness of it until when the first resurrection blessed are those who are partakers of the first resurrection brother Graham said that's the time when you get a change of this body why because the body that you're living in right now God will not allow that sinful byproduct to go into his presence no sir it's got to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye guess what the this old Mortal body is going to put on a different kind of a body Hallelujah and theophany is going to envelop itself into this and you're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you're going to be changed and you're going to be like him Hallelujah you'll be able to come into the presence of God why God has changed you but until that time this old stinking flesh gonna be with you all the time and we've got to crucify the Flesh on a daily basis somebody say daily amen let's look at what brother Brown says about this Great Masterpiece let's continue his toils and wearys and long nights housed away from the world for days maybe eat a sandwich he's talking about Michelangelo and he rub on it and get back and now that's just not the way it was now it's got to come down to this and rubbing it then when he saw it just perfect then he saw it in reality the negative of what was in his mind had become real it became positive therefore it sprung into him and it was so real that he must cry out speak to me it was a reflection look at this because a woman is a reflection it was a compliment she compliments him it was a compliment to his work that his own work was so inspired him that it would become he would become beside himself to Smite it to say speak but it was the flaw that made it the masterpiece without the flaws in humanity there would be no need for a savior if there was no sickness in our flesh there would be no need for a Healer if there was no sheep that ever was lost there would be no need to send a shepherd I came he said to seek and to save that which was lost my sheep hear my voice if there was no war there would be no need for him to send peace if we had our own righteousness there would be no need for God to give us his righteousness but the Bible calls our righteousness is as filthy rags you can't never be good enough so God is not looking at your flaws and your failures God is not looking at all of these faults and flaws that you have it was all of your flaws mistakes that makes him good do you understand that it was the flaw that made the Masterpiece what it was those flaws that you have in your life at some time will activate or need to activate one or more of the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah and we've made a bunch of these copies here for the church and if you don't have this I want you to get it and ask these deacons because we've got several hundred so all of you should get a copy of this and I want you to keep it in your Bible and it'll show you the places where you can find Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rafa Jehovah Nissi Jehovah Shalom it'll show you it'll show you the places where God came down and what he did he said I'm Jehovah when Abraham needed to sacrifice God came down and provided for him a ram and the ram was cut caught in the thickets Hallelujah do you understand that what God was doing was coming down and providing God was Jehovah Jireh and so therefore Abraham said this I call this place Jehovah Jireh God who provides how many of you have had God come down and you know supernaturally Jehovah Jireh he gave you a house he gave you a job he gave you a wife Jehovah Jireh he provided he got it and he brought it down to you and he said here I am I'm Jehovah Jireh I have provided this it wasn't you if there was no flaw there would be no need to be redeemed back if there was no flaws there would be no need for a masterpiece God is a Waymaker God is a provider he's the same yesterday today and forever this flawed kingdom here on Earth will not last much longer it is becoming so flawed right now you can see it this kingdom is so quickly the minds of the people today are becoming so corrupt that the spirits demon spirits from Down Below have now interpenetrated into this realm until they're acting like their father the devil and his works have you noticed all of these squatters that are getting into people's houses now better not go on a vacation too long you people that go for a month I'll tell you you come back you might have somebody in your home so therefore you better put somebody in your house while you're gone squatter he said Satan's a squatter he has squatted on the territory and said it's mine I'm going to be it and you know what he takes the laws of this land you can't get me out of here but God is a Waymaker [Music] the great leaders of the world today are talking about a great reset how they want to reset everything well I'll tell you what God's beat him to the punch God is going to do a great reset God is fixing to take this flawed Kingdom and push it right out and bring us a kingdom that cannot be moved he's bringing us a king and a kingdom that has no flaw he's bringing us back to Eden he's bringing us back because Adam and Eve they never finished their time in Eden he was cut off and the day you eat this is the day you dry so God said I'm gonna bring it back I'm going to take this Adam and I'm going to take deceive and I'm going to bring them back to Eden and what God is doing is he's spoiling the devil's eating as Satan got to the first Eve and got to her by reasoning and spoiled the first Eden and they were cast down God comes down in the midst of Satan's Eden and he doesn't seduce no he just speaks his word and when he speaks his word he comes down and and takes a woman a woman elect of God a woman that's not forgiven but as though she never did it Satan took the first woman and because of reasoning and spoiled the first Eden so God it's just vice versa on the devil he said I'm coming down in the midst of the worst of the worst of all generations when they're poor miserable blind wretched and naked and don't know it and I'm coming down and I'm going to take a woman right out of his Eden and it won't be by reasoning it'll be by faith and the faith that you have is not of yourself it is a gift of God so this whole thing that God is doing it's him doing it it's him calling it's him giving the faith it's him calling you it's him taking you out of cnh because he's fixing to bring another kingdom that's why this Kingdom's falling apart it's got to Satan's nothing but a squatter in the sermon of Masterpiece brother random gone we see the conditions of the time we see the condition of the people we see the condition of politics we see the condition of the world it can't stand it's got to sink like the Titanic it must go down for theirs give room one nation gives room to another it has it falls and this Kingdom Must Fall and every other Kingdom give room to that Kingdom that's coming which cannot fall for we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved through this perfect image of God the masterpiece continuing on now here paragraph 81 the Masterpiece got down through the age hewing away by the Patriarchs and made his platform and brought them up from the different things that would lay the foundation upon upon this he began to build his word the prophets and then finally come out the perfect Prophet the perfect Foundation the perfect vision God had and now in order for this to speak he is the word and for the word was had to speak he must come into the image and then from the image to speak it's got to be smitten he comes into the image and then in order to speak the perfect Redeemer oh all the types of the Old Testament was met in him as I said the other day Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new amen Brethren do we have a problem with the overhead I'm giving you the quotes I like the people to read them so if if there's no problem I'm going to go to the the quote here on expectation now here's an amazing thing that when I read my Bible I see all of the flaws and the problems and the failures of the act of the elect all the way from Genesis all the way down through I see Adam failed I see Noah field I see this one failed I see you Elijah had a temper and he curses children and six the the bear upon them and they eat them up he said that wasn't that wasn't a Godly nature that was a angry prophet he had an anger problem did any of you have an anger problem yeah I'm just like Elijah so flaws all kinds of flaws we're talking about saints of God let me kind of try to bring this down to a close the flaw is what made it the masterpiece when I read in my Bible I see all those who made mistakes and flaws that the elect had in their lives and I tell you what if you think that you are flawless just let somebody hang around you for a day or two and they'll see every flaw you got it sure don't take long either in the sermon expectation I'm going down I'm just going to find some flaws that that meeting I'll find some flaws of that preacher I'll bet you I can don't worry you'll get it the devil will show you plenty of them yes sir so which one of you is going to keep your Halo on right now and tell me you ain't got no flaws well I'll tell you what let them hang around you a little bit let them go to lunch with you let them ride in the car live in your house for a few days they'll find every flaw we have to got to be tied tried and tested to find out where our flaws are at yeah God allows you to see your own flaw just about the time you think you're doing pretty good he shows you another area oh thank you Lord I didn't know I you know I've been praying for patience but guess what when you pray for patience what do you get tribulation I quit praying for patience God I've got enough it's okay I'm good oh the Lord is so gracious to us it was the flaw that made the Masterpiece have a purpose in the mighty conqueror there's anything that makes it Christian lazy it's when they're on a flowery bed of ease we don't have it persecution enough we don't have it hard enough always at the chain always at the chain is the strongest at its weakest link a man under pressure is is when he excuse me a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure his real true characteristics will show when he's under pressure get him all riled stirred up and he had the real man Kim hunt got temporary little shorts though if he's Meek in general insurance you know put him under the pressure once God puts all his children under test to see whether there's any flaws in them how many of you last week saw some flaws in your life don't take long and God will show you just about the time you think you're doing good God will show you another era in your life that he needs to work on they all had floss in a identified Christ of all ages what David was what Moses was what Elijah was what all of it was in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily he was the god prophet he was god Jehovah became flesh in his own son raised himself a tabernacle manifest himself in all of the rest of them failed they had flaws but there's no flaw in him even God himself said this my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in that's right no flaw in him here ye him he was manifested God so where was the flaw in her where is the flaw today in her if you're honest and you're really honest with yourself you realize I am so flawed but I want I want to play this side of the record but I don't want to play predestination so much that you're just predestinating you can live any kind of life you want to no because that makes it nothing but a bunch of disgrace when it's all Grace and Grace Grace Grace and then you are not living the way you should live shame on you no the reason that you live the kind of life you do is because God Gave You Grace and you saw that you need a savior you saw that you need a redeemer you saw that you need those things you need a good look at yourself you see when a worshiper came to offer a lamb once a year and came to the high priest here's an amazing thing the high priest never looked at the worshiper he looked at the worshipers Lambs God's not looking at you he's looking at the lamb that you bring and a lamb is without spot or blemish the worshiper is the one with the blemish the lamb was without spot or blemish the Lamb of God was without he was the Masterpiece but what it makes the Masterpiece such a masterful thing is he could take all of our sins and our iniquities and our flaws upon him that's what makes him the masterpiece wow wow when we confess our sins and we place our hand on the lamp and he dies God is not looking at the believer he's looking at the lamb now here's a a scripture that I want to I had never seen this before until just the other day I want to share this with you Revelations 3 verse 1 through 6. and unto the angel of the Church of Sardis Wright these sayings saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars and I Know Thy works that thou Hast the name that thou livest and are dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God interesting they're remember therefore how that thou Hast received and hurt and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with him in white for they are worthy he that overcome the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not block out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says the church is so let me show you what the prophet of God has to say about I have not found thy works perfect before God seven Church ages brother Brown said now be careful and get this this is what the second verse that I read for I have not found thy works perfect before God do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it's unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it was just the start of getting back that is why the Bible called it Reformation not restoration it had started out in the doctrine of justification when Schmitz salvation was all of God oh how Luther preached the sovereignty of God and election he knew it was all of Grace he separated the church from rule by the ecclesiastical hierarchy he tore down the idols he cast out the confessions to the priest he denounced the pope it was wonderfully good as he started but God had said 1500 years before Luther you're going to start things but your age will see it all unfulfilled I'm leaving that to later I wonder who that later is hallelujah our god reigneth he knows the end from the beginning yes Luther was the messenger it didn't look like it as we examine the flaws but there was a man called Jonah he had flaws in his life too yeah he was a prophet though you and I might not want to say so on the basis of how he acted but God knows them that are his and he has his way just as he did with Jonah so let me tell you Jonah if you're in this group God knows how to get your attention he had his way with Luther in that age and he'll have his way until the consummation Hallelujah we can examine all the flaws of God's elect we can see that the flaws is what made him the masterpiece he became me that I might become him The Great Masterpiece became smitten for the sins and failures of the Bride it was the flaw that made it the masterpiece testimony upon the sea and I'm closing musicians if you come therefore all of us are born by sexual desire and blood in us or sinful blood through a perverted way of bringing children to the Earth God just spoke Adam come forward so the woman was not in the original creation she was a byproduct of man taken from the side of rib Adam's Spirit was both male and female both feminist and masculine in the spirit God separated and masculine from the feminist put the femination the woman and masculine and man see both Body Spirit they are one that's the reason when Sarah laughed at the angel she could not be like that God would have slew that woman right there but he couldn't hurt her because she's part of Abraham he'd hurt Abraham if he took Sarah that's the reason our sins today would be everyone condemned but God can't take us because if he does he hurts Christ we're a part of him we're the bride don't you see so Grace holds us in our mistakes until we can see better my last quote here the masterpiece the perfect image the God man God in Martha had changed from Supernatural to the vision the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death God's perfect masterpiece he could not do it in Moses he could not do it in the prophets Isaiah who was sawed with saws till he was sawed to pieces he could not do it in the prophets that were stoned he could not do it because he couldn't feel it there was just a portion of him but in this perfect Masterpiece he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he not only project Moses he could project the entire being into this person and taste death for the whole human race God's perfect Masterpiece God so inspired by seeing it he become the Redeemer of all ages to speak for those in the backgrounds who had been before and now all promises was met in him he was the Perfection of the Perfection he was the types of all fulfilled in him our Kinsmen Redeemer in Ruth and Boaz our law Giver from Mount Sinai our Prophet from the Wilderness he come from the mount he come from the Willis he come from eternity and become man the perfect image you see the Masterpiece spoke on behalf of all of our sins and all of our failures and all of our flaws he became a perfect image of God's vision and God told him to speak he was smitten and Afflicted he was bruised for our iniquities now we can clearly see that the flawed masterpiece and we can see the flaw Ed is what made it the masterpiece a different direction I had never seen that before the prophet of God said it was the flaw that made it the masterpiece I want to say to all of you it is your flawed individual personality complex characteristic it is you the flawed individual that makes him the masterpiece oh aren't you glad you got a masterpiece God took him and laid upon him the sins of all of us oh you talk about a masterpiece he could take the very sting of death and Hell itself and place it into his bosom and he would take away all our sins all our iniquities everything we ever did do everything we thought about doing and everything that we will do he took it unto himself and he became me that I might become you do you see that Masterpiece this morning taking it from a different angle oh I thank God now I realize that when I try to goo do good evil is present with me and that which I don't want to do that I do and that which I want to do I don't do oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death tell you what saints of God there's coming a day [Music] there's coming a day when I'm going to step into that theophany I tell you it's hovering
