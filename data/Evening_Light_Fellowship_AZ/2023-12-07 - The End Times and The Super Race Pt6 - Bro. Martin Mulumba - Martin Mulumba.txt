this day unto you Lord we ask all these things father in Jesus Christ's name amen amen may the Lord bless you all uh it's a privilege once again to be in the house of the Lord while uh we still standing we'll take the Book of Luke 22:25 to quickly save us some time and he said unto them uh the kings of the Gentiles getze Lord lordship over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors I Believe by God's grace we took the verse 20 uh 4 and 25 for the last few Services uh verse 26 but ye shall not be so meaning he had shown to the disciples what the Gentiles were in all those Services uh but he that he is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is Chief as he do serve may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated uh we'll be uh continuing with uh the end time and the super race and uh believe this will be part six and for the coming of the Lord in Babylon that will be part five God willing or part four God's grace as uh we looking uh we've been looking into uh this uh subject as uh Jesus was dealing with the disciples in the land in the promised land where they were found and uh surrounded by U the Roman Empire at the time the Lord took them on as side as we remember in Luke 6 Jesus continued all night in prayer and came and uh selected few people to be uh his disciples and along the journey in Jour uh Luke 22 he started now uh looking into their lives because of what seemed to have been so important to them for one to be greater and the other one not to be of uh a less importance but uh as uh we go through uh the whole journey we see that Jesus didn't just pick up the disciples just to for them to be um have name labels that we are in the message of the hour that we are this and you know all that but Jesus picked them up for a very specific purpose because they were under consideration before the foundation of the world and uh the Disciples of course represents the Believers today and uh the son of man we have received in the last hour revealed uh in the form of the W shiv according uh to levitic 23 and uh we see that also gives us uh an Insight with Revelation 14 as we saw it last time the third Angel's message uh going all together but then by God's grace we understand that as the Lord gives gives us these things it's not just for us to be set apart and have uh some greater knowledge and uh have a higher language but it is for a transformation uh it is for a physical healing a spiritual spiritual healing and also the healing of the Soul so the importance of uh timing is very important because we we do not understand our time we'll be preaching yesterday message or we will be preaching today's message with yesterday understanding which uh can be really a good strike to the of the enemy to have somebody read brother Bram but then still thinking as if he was living in the 1950s or in the 1960s which would be a great trap it's like you know yeah that's what we have the message when he preached it in 54 no we're not in 53 or in 54 right because uh the angel of the Lord said I am the same yesterday today and forever so therefore if he the same yesterday today and forever what he preached 54 should be also in actuality today because as we are looking around and we are able to see that the world is changing but then in the very same message to you whom uh the word has been given you are able to see it with Clarity that hey this is not something historical that the message is not something to dep to debate upon and as well we see that uh just after 60 65 the departure of the Prophet the move had started but in 54 uh in 54 he says that the great upcoming Revival and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost he says but the that church is coming up but just after his departure people picked up the same thing and they start saying the move is on who's right is it in 54 or is it in 66 so when we move forward uh people in the 70s uh they had the experiences and uh they were picking up a few scriptures here and there a few quotations here and there thinking hey 77 we we living but they didn't just look into God's program they did just didn't put everything into place no wonder some left him at a certain point just as Jesus did he took them in the first stage they applauded him for everything that he did after a while a certain number left after a while another number left again and to this day we're still under the same cycle after certain event some people will be leaving but as you said Jesus said that you have Jesus continued all night in prayer yet in the midst of those that Jesus picked up Judas was there and Jesus also knows that Judas has to leave he has to do everything for him to leave I know it's not good to see some of our brothers and sisters leave but according to the scriptures our brother our sister have to leave because it's scriptural because uh if they find a way to get in Jesus said I have to do those things unless I save them L they hear and they repent but the language has been given only to those who were under consideration and uh so therefore it's not a collective thing where oh I heard this you speak of all this this application is right or this application is wrong but then to you to whom the AR where the dove will come and give the leaf opening up another world it's just a glorious element in this hour the same quotations that we reading the same tapes that we hearing some have become polygamist some have become taken set extreme with the very same message so therefore we understand that uh Jesus knows exactly what he's doing and as we are going through the coming of the Lord in Babylon we see that Jesus had to come down or God has to come down or the angel of the Lord had to come down for one purpose because he had a consideration of a certain people and such a people were set there for a good reason which each one of us depending on where we are according to the grace that God has given us some have went into deep into it but as also we look into this it gives us also a clear another understanding to be aware of certain things that surrounds us how to address them because he wants the bride to be perfect be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect and as long as we still breathing God still has a work to do for us God is still giving us some people to work with God is still revealing unto us some work to work to do and as the Lord is showing these things it makes us aware that the word is not to be historical the word is not to be looked at as something to come to church to show up when the pastor is there to do not show up when he's not there to show up when I can to do not show up when I cannot but the word says if the holy spirit is in you you have to be there besides it nothing else will push you to be there we can have all the explanation we want to give but the word will still be the same yesterday today and forever amen uh we were looking at uh the coming of the Lord last time the Lord came down in Babylon seeing the great nation that the people nimro has built and uh the Lord started showing us that how the spirit of God coming in the form of the angel in the message uh the healing of Jared's daughter I was baptizing them down at the end of Spring Street in Jeffersonville Indiana in Ohio River near 7 or 8,000 people standing in on the bank bear witness that 2 2 2:00 in the evening June 1933 how that that a pill of fire came down out of heaven and hung over where I was standing the prophet is uh taking us continuing with uh the thought of the coming of the Lord because uh coming has been a very good debate in this last day what is the coming where did he come has he come has he not come some believe he has not come some believe have come and uh there's all kind of uh Theory or all kind of perception out of all these things here but uh thank God that we have these things on recording and in in writing forms as we can all read that at times you're looking forward so far but the quotation is right there looking at you but you're looking for him so far away and when uh you start looking for him so far away we start conceptualizing when he comes he has to be this way he has to be this way no but it has to be exactly as the word says that is going to be as we read it last time um what is the Revelation the Revelation is God only giving people more information in order for them to understand and receive the prophecy in other words what you read in one place of the scripture that doesn't make any sense wait for the angel of the Lord to come back around again to give you more information for you to understand the first part of the scripture let's not run so quickly with uh doctrines as we like to to call them in the message it says that you know the pillow Fire come down out of heaven and hung over where I standing I believe as message believer we all understand what is heaven because the astronaut have went up there they never got to heaven and they're still exploring they keep exploring and with uh today telescope they can have uh 192 billion like years now that they can capture and they still want to get to that heaven yet but Ram tells us Heaven is right here butam says did you hear that amen is people from the other side it's not people from from this side so let's not look for heaven somewhere out there because as he said like you know the pill of fire came out of Heaven it came from somewhere it just didn't movement of up and down now it's just changing forms and uh the pill of fire came down of heaven and hang over where I was standing but look where did he come from uh the ker General the Mystic light appears over local Baptist Angelic world baptizing at the river very Mystic thing people could not understand many fed at the presence of it the angel of the Lord come right down and hang over where I was 87 then notice on down through life it kept appearing one day under the uh the appearing of this light came forth an angel of the came forth an angel that told me I was to pray for the sick the same angel that came down out of Heaven the same Angel kept appearing unto him hearing voices and this day the the same Angel out of the same form came a man a man who spoke to him at the river gave him a little bit of information he came down and then he comes back around again to give him more information as we saw it last time that the angel was just like anybody it looked like you know Smooth hair to the shoulders barefooted with olive skin what we'll probably call you know skin of our brothers Mexican Brothers the man was standing out there if he had to walk around the city he will just look like any man it wouldn't be any different but then as you go through the message the same Angel comes around with different forms not only the pillow fire because one time he stood there there he looked around the the door and he saw a man looking like an Indian he walked out and said did you people see him he said no we didn't see anybody then he understood who that was when we looking for him in a certain form that if I Lord I'm looking to see you I want to see you don't expect him to appear to you as a Mexican if you're not Mexican that's how he identifies himself many times many of you have asked for the Lord to appear to you and he did come look at in which form did he come to you he didn't come to you like a Mexican brother he came to you in the form that you know the him to be one time you saw your pastor in your dream that was the angel of the Lord one time you were in need on the street and you saw a stranger coming to you that was the angel of of the Lord where did he come from he came from heaven and where was Heaven just nearby looking for him so far but he just around us and that angel of the Lord is coming and he start giving people now more information so they can be able to understand the purpose of their life on Earth that's right so now this Angel of the Lord I told him I couldn't do it that's years ago he told me he told me that God had told me to do so this guy whose life he couldn't understand our very life that we couldn't understand we looking for him and said Lord I don't understand why am I this way why am I different from the rest of the world now that same Angel is coming now in the form of the people that he has appointed in your day for you to be able to start understanding your strange and misunderstood life because school could not understand your life school told you you can do anything that you want but the angel of the Lord comes and tell you exactly what you have to do because school tells you you can be an astronaut you can be a physician you can be but he doesn't tell you exactly what to do but the angel of the Lord comes to him and tells him this is what you are called to do amen and some in the Journey of brother Bram have limited brother Bram to that concept because Revelation is to give people more information to receive and understand the prophecy because the prophecy said I will send you Elijah the prophet but when the angel of the Lord comes he tells him that you are called to pray for the sick but the prophecy is not complete yet right so it is with our lives we born as babies we don't understand they show us this is Papa this is Mama then afterward they send us to school they give us to another leadership and that leadership takes us they just say with more the same way Abraham uh Genesis 11 is under the leadership of his parents in Genesis 12 the Lord takes over because in the same message leadership brother bam shows us that we are brought up from our mothers then she gives us to Our Father who gives us also so to our teacher then to our pastor then afterward then we have to be introduced to the angel of the Lord but bam says many of the converts are done between 17 and 21 years old because Mary received s such visitation around that same age so then each part of our lives are determined to have a certain Angel leader to tell us the portion of Our Lives amen and therefore then according to the part in which we are found we need to pay attention as the angel of the Lord told Moses I behold I send my angel be before you pay attention to him so therefore each one of us as we start identifying the angel of the Lord of in our lives in the form that he's taking we need to pay attention to it because so without that understanding then we are embracing somebody else judgment somebody else Journey but then the Lord puts this pardon of leadership in order for you to be led and for him to receive you but then if you unable to love and to respect and to follow the leadership of the Angel of the Lord that you can see how you going to be able to listen and follow the leadership of the voice of the Angel of the Lord because he has to give you first the sign and then behind the sign follows the voice applying that principle then gives us the understanding that the angel of the Lord led him because baram says and I looked I seen his feet and he and he got to me he was a tall man it was heavy set weight about 200 lb it just looked like just as natural as I'm standing here he had his arm folded folded like this first I never seen him in that form then he sees him in another form in a human form then the angel of the Lord told him he said fear not I knew that was the same voice that spoke to me all along that was the first time I ever seen him like that but I know I knew the voice as he he he said fear not I am send from the presence of the of the almighty God to tell you that your peculiar birth and peculiar life being always misunderstood with men said your per life and particular Birth has been to indicate that you you take a gift of healing to the peoples of the world the angel of the Lord is teaching him is not limiting him but is showing him what the previous teacher could not help him with because Dr Davis couldn't help because that was not given to him to explain to him because Dr Davis could not was not given the ability to explain to him that part of his life Dr Davis could give him a Pulpit to preach a sermon his mother could give him his life story on how on his the day of his birth how a pillar or a light came in the room each one of these Messengers were only giving him a portion of his life that's right so now H has the the the the the the time goes he said now notice then I said but I can't I can't heal no one but I said this I do say the angel of the Lord speaking when I was a baby born up in uh in the in the state of Kentucky according to my own Dear Mother and and in which have been Vindicated through my life I said there was a light came in in the room uh in the room of that little old hle there there wasn't no that where it was where it was at no floor in it they didn't have a window they just had a little old the thing off for a window there a little door uh and and they pushed it open about 5 5 5:00 in the morning and this light circle in just as it was breaking day I said since that time it's been with me it's an angel of God he met me in person few years ago listen to this down through my life he told me things that's happened and I have told them just as he told me and a challenge in anybody at any place to go to the city where I was raised and anywhere else that a statement has ever been made in the name of the Lord but what come just exactly the way it said he would and now not in not me but it was him I said anyone here any Christian knows that God will not have nothing to do with error God is truth from the very birth of the believer where he thought that his life was just a natural life but then this Prophet this messenger these tipes have been given unto us for us to be able to start understanding what is our lives because teach the child the way it should go so that when it shall grow it shall not depart from it and how the teacher going to teach the child without being taught himself amen so therefore the angel of the Lord must come first from the presence of God in order to teach him what to do the son doeth nothing except he has sin first done by the father so the same pattern now being now applied to the parent being applied to the teachers being applied to all these people here that the form in which the angel of the Lord is taking is to reveal to these people what they are what they have to do amen so now as the people now are receiving the gift being sent to them brother bam say they are in a golden age because it is a age of Peace because Dr Davis could not explain certain things it was a time like in the age of reformers certain things could not be clear but then when the gift was sent then the whole story now becomes clear oh I have this gift of preaching oh I have this potential to be a mother or I have this potential to be this based according to the angel that came from the presence of God because they are also the devil being also a angel of Light will also be sent to you to test you if you believe the Lord or not because Martin stood there and an angel appeared unto him with a different program but thank God that Martin has the the the the the scroll with him in order for him to compare the thing because we embracing all kind of teachings we embracing all kind of religions all kind of belief but then without having the Parn having the principle knowing what all these things is all about why the angel of the Lord has to come down then we are just swept along way with everybody else that's right so now as he coming down it says the same Angel if whoever has been in your presence has been telling you certain things and whatever that he has been telling you along the way if these things are to be proven to be tried and to be found true then you can look like the children of Israel that when they were facing the challenge they could say that God of our fathers that's right they were able to speak God of our fathers because these fathers were proven because their lives were tested amen and the faith of Abraham was accepted of the Lord because God had found him that he St not to the promise of God through unbelief and now the people the children of Israel afterward they were able to take the promises because Moses could only take Genesis 15 as a promise of his life based on the fact that Abraham was able to be found worthy to receive the promise of God Amen because Genesis 15 speaks your see shall be uh slave or in bondage in a foreign land but I will deliver them with my mighty hand that was the promise given to him so then Moses mother had to take Moses and teach him the scripture that has been proven so it is also with all of us today that when we are looking at our lives we taking this same pardon according to the prophecy that has been given to us as I have done with the prophet so shall I do with you because he has to be the same yesterday today and forever and as he's opening the mystery of him yesterday today and forever we're not just looking at it as of like you know I need healing in the body I need the job I need this year no but the gift the purpose we unto we are called right that Dr Davis could not give to us because uh Moses mother could only teach him that hey go to church pay your tithes dress this way but until the possession from being in the house being in the palace thinking that I have to go through the political system in order for me to guarantee the next stage to to be the governor of the land of of Egypt for me now to take the people out no that was not God's program the teaching was true but the application was wrong so therefore then it required the same mystery of Exodus 3 Moses behind the bush alone with God and has he gets into this pH of looking at the system and looking at the his ability and strips himself away from it then now the angel of the Lord was able to get into action now the B brother says uh Souls that are in prison now the ones out of under the blood they died without Mercy there was Moses last pool first a young man talking to Israel a man that went to school a man that knows how to speak a man that is able to do a lot of things and military training brother Bram says he was a doctor because he went he was educated in the knowledge of of the Egyptians the knowledge that brother says that even to this day we are unable to reproduce how the pyramid was built how did they do it but Moses was taught in the same education and so it is also with all of us today we are taught nurses doctors and accountants and engineers and all these things here but despite of all that knowledge none of that will be able to help us to get into that program because the angel of the Lord said I came down to see what city that the people of men the children of men have built that was Moses he was built according to the knowledge of the Egyptians we are built according to the world today how to speak English how to speak French how to speak Portuguese Spanish and all this year that's what the world has taught us that's what our previous teachers have demonstrated the ability to raise us into it's so simple when you have somebody who speaks in a certain language and clearly according to uh uh the paragraphs of uh of of of of of a certain language and how to expose how to present how to dress and all these things though that is good but it's not enough it says second went down to deliver them and how did he do it it's because he went down and dealt with the People based with the encounter with the angel third was the last message we'll get to that I'll skip that for now the miracle has has been done Moses was only road to the promised land with the redeemed oh God be merciful we see that Moses before the meeting of the Angel of the Lord William Branham before meeting the angel of the Lord William Branham with the angel of the Lord Moses with the angel of the Lord in the form of pill of fire and the same Moses the same William Bram now God gives him in ability gives him a gift reveals to him a portion of his life right and as Believers also I know these things that you know them but as Believers that these things now has not to be applied in our lives to what stage are we at come to church listen to a sermon take notes go back criticize pray about it at what stage are we at because if it's just come to church come back out come to church come back out is the same way that the devil does is here present among us because we saw that those unconverted Bunch that were in the church with a powerful thought they were in the church for they wanted to fulfill a certain purpose so now each one of us would have to know what are we here for is it the leadership of the pastor of the mother of the church or I have to go to church for the sake of the children because we can have our religion we're covering up I I have to be there because if I'm not there the brother will see the sister will see because of our hidden agendas because we have so many agendas let me be faithful later on then I get a promotion let me be faithful so later on they can them years one but the angel of the Lord said I come down to see what the children of men have built what city have you built what religion have you built because when they were building the city that say let's build it so we can get higher so we can be looked at as people of a certain degree so we can be looked at as some people of a certain rename but the angel of the Lord is also coming down veram says that as the time was happening people didn't know or people were coming into these elements butam says well it says in the message God providing healing for this generation when the serpent used as an insight for many after while they got to worshiping the serpent instead of God that it represented the people who had received received the teaching all these years now they started appealing to the angel of the Lord Brother what I'm saying never once have I ever worshiped the angel of the Lord because he knew that that form was not to be worshiped and today we worship our churches we worship our wives we worship our jobs we worship all everything that we know that we love so much that we worship the Lord said I will give you a gift go to school learn how to speak have some money and the people started worshiping the job they give more importance to the job than any than the word of the the work of the Lord PR brother why because that's what the Lord in you he had to do in order to separate the people nimro came among the people with a powerful thought in mind he wanted to lift himself above the stars of God with your money how do you see yourself now toward others with our knowledge how do we behave around others because with Nimrod he wanted to do what he wanted destroy the land and divide people call them by race and give them a group social low class middle class higher class 1% one of the 1% and all these things here keep dividing dividing dividing the people then the Lord comes now and say and says I came down to explain to you your strange and misunderstood life amen after all this year that you've been through which side are you taking brother bam says you see there was no inside there was nothing left that the people could seek to see or look upon and believe that God will still heal and immediately there come a whirlwind down out of heaven in the pool of beesa and God provided a way of healing to for the people and every Israelite that belied in in God and believe he was a Healer could step into that pool and it was troubled and healed of any kind of disease he had now you're moving forward you see that oh well it's not just a church attending a church attendance itself let me believe in the ministers let me believe the prophet but God is not satisfied God is not satisfied the prophet is showing us that people were s sitting there in the wilderness they had need of healing in the body God provided a way of healing you come to church you want to listen to a sermon God provide a minister God provide a pastor but God is not satisfied because he can see that somebody else has his favorite preacher he can see somebody is like you know my pastor is still this one here my pastor is still this one here I can't listen to this brother I can't listen to that brother why because the idol worshiping Spirit has got hold of them because they were not under consideration oh my come on the ins sign was lifted of course God will lift to minister God will give you marriage God will give you money but watch out where that's taking you let's watch out where that is taking us then as the Lord as the people were doing itam says it said that when they started doing it then the prophet rose up and got the serpent and tore it up tore it up that's right everything that we have before us that we know that is we love so much oh me it's such a person when such a person before I believe you let me let me consult with uh with my brother there with the minister there brother bam says at the moment that you do that you become a denomination and in the church edes it says I hate that thing right God is looking in the midst of Babylon a people to whom he comes to to deal with and so that they can be able to know the purpose of their lives as God Is Lifting the inside before you let's be careful he said that there was no insign then a God in knew and the Bible says says paragraph 23 and a long came the Lord Jesus in the days of this the pool was just about ready to be done away with God has never left the people without a provided way for healing and just the time the pool was going to be done away with Titus was going to Siege the walls of Jerusalem and burn the city and Jesus had prophesies of it Jesus was sent on on the scene and he was and he was God's provided way of healing each timing was very important the overlaping of the ages the overlaping of the Ministries the overlaping of the prophecies moving from one section of the word into another section of the word but at the same time the Lord says be careful watch and pray so that you don't leave read the message with a yesterday understanding am we looking for him we're looking for him we're looking for him but he said that you know I will come down and as is coming down in what form is he coming down in the form that is coming down into are we turning that form into an an sign to worship and even when we start worshiping the form then the Lord what does the Lord Do It tears it apart puts it away and then moves into the another Direction because it's only given to the Believers amen because if it was not given to the Believers all of us would have been like 20 million or 7 billion of people on Earth would have believed the message but thank God as we're moving forward the numbers getting lesser and lesser and lesser why because of the inside the inside has become a stumbling block to many the inside has become a stumbling block because the voice has to come but then when before the voice comes before the last part of Moses Ministry the message to come the Lord has to be assured what kind of people am I dealing with here it is 27 of the same message after is going away he said how will not leave you comfortless I'll give you another inside if I be lifted from the earth I'll draw all men unto me and the things that I do shall you do even greater than this for I go unto my father and he commissioned human beings to go all to to go to go to all the world and preach the gospel and demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost until he returns as a sign the same spirit is only carrying on with his journey but now to the Believers now the great mystery of the age is to know which form he has taken when he moves from one form to another quickly we Embrace Idol worshiping I can only pay my ti to you I can only do this I can only do this to this person why because we start worshiping the person without even realizing yet it's very so simple I only love people of my community I only love I only visit these people that visit me in it is that same Spirit it is the same Idol worshiping that the devil that nimod had started but as now the journey continues on then the Lord is looking at the people he said like well to you the Believers I am Jehovah Gyra I am the one he said did you notice the angels that came that come down investigated Sodom before Sodom was destroyed just as it was with Jesus before Titus came into the land just as it was with Moses before the destruction of the Egyptians it is the same way also he's bringing us now just before Sodom was destroyed the angel also again came down where is this Angel going why is this Angel keep changing forms where is he taking us by him coming down for what purpose yeah why should we be tracking him from one form to another why should we be looking for him from one person to the next can he just have one single form in which we can love him and we can worship him just as job would say if I knew his house I would have went to him because they wanted to see him in the days of Jesus is say sir we would see Jesus they were looking for him they are looking for him we are looking for him even to this day Peter Paul says to whom who are rejoicing looking unto his appearing people are still looking for him but then he says I'll come as a thief in the night and in the night of Babylon he comes down down to a specific bride in a specific manner so they can be able to catch the message because as it came down in Exodus 3 it was not it was a public show to everybody everybody could see the first sign everybody could see the second sign everybody people could even impersonate the first and the second but the last part was only reserved to a specific group amen yet the tape is available to all yet everybody Praises play but look at the result why because of the ins sign because the sign the one after a sign we will need a sign Billy Paul is your sign now before Billy Paul dies he has to be young yeah that's your sign on after he dies he takes away the sign now people are living why because the same Angel of the Lord does his job he has to cut you out he has to put questions he has to give you materials for you to leave the word we William Bram we need William Brenham to come back no understand that the angel of the Lord who came from the presence of God takes a form do does a certain part of the work and in move moves to another form Don't Preach the message with a yesterday understanding as is opening as is showing in the form of your pastor in the form of the minister in the form of whosoever that you love so much and all these great ministers understand that it takes the form changes the form and moves on with his work amen amen because of the same angel that called you because nobody can come to me L the father draws him first Jesus continued all night in prayer then came selecting the disciples when he was selecting them he was not based upon like I like this formam I like this form I like that one no he's looking at the seed amen and that seed that was planted in different form that's what he's coming onto but he knows that when the son of man was planting seed in the field also the the other men came also planting the seed and all of them all together they were crying out to him if we said let's pray somebody who knows the message quot the message quot the message the BR is very spiritual that's why we calling the message today because the person is just is just ping out knowledge but then watch now where the person is going with the message quickly you find out he doesn't know where the word what what in what stage of the program we at quickly he wants to be holding on to his race or ra holding on to his job holding on to this left and right I'll prove it with the word it says you see investigated Sodom before before Sodom was destroyed you remember that congregation says amen there was a bunch of them come down three of them one of them stayed with Abraham you remember that there were lights from heaven we just understood what what heaven is that came down in the investigating judgment look they all they all found around the Pentagon and things and find them that's the world judgment Sodom and there is one listen to this and there is one represented will be represented amongst the church will be Christ himself vindicating himself in heavens above and signs in Earth Below certainly and unveiling of God and I want you to know to notice the form that God chose to talk to job to talk to job in job was veiled when he talked to job he was veiled in a wildwind came down in a wildwind you believe that that still comes in a whirlwind can come where where you see where where you see there is several sitting here here and number that with other when he came in the warwind told us the day before before uh brother brother brother benw and then when he said take up this rock throw it up in the air and say that say the Lord you will see it right away as is coming along in his journey the angel of the Lord who once was a light who was once was a voice and here now he's coming now in the form of the Whirlwind and he says but he will be represented Jesus Christ himself in the church represented where is he am where is he somebody should have an answer amen that's where the boldness of the believer comes into play where is he where is he I have to push two three times for you to answer huh the angel of the Lord is coming down he said you see right away and and I picked up the rock on the up up the mountain to up out of course and he said well you said I said well it's very easy if you just let your own thinking get away and think the Bible terms they are selfmade being God is Spirit Jesus is the body that he was veiled in I said certainly Abraham said it was he was one of one uh he was the one who talk to him he out to know he out to know you out to know I have to know when I meet him I have to know because when I see him coming in the form of the worldwind when I see him appearing when I see him stepping out of the light when I see him with a certain form I know him amen amen because he's been teaching me since my birth all along my life by vindicating every single word that he spoke to me then when I stood there and they took the my picture then it becomes his picture and when now he's changing form I'm should now be aware when I see him the next time around because job was acquainted with the form that he will came into and now according to the part of the prophecy we are to know know in what form that he's in it is easy for us to say Amen to that but then by God's grace as time goes along then he has to challenge if you truly believe him in that form good he has to challenge you and when he comes not to challenge you in that form now watch out your true nature comes out because along the ages when Martin went to the king and he wanted to see him the fellow didn't recognize him in that form he stood there and said like you know that person of a lower class get him out of here then Martin had now to show him that he was the angel of the Lord in that age then fire now has to come under his Pew for him to stand up and go and talk to him because the fellow on the throne thought like you know his position was given to him in order for him to have all the confidence in the world to lead the world in whatever he thought he would be nice so it is also with us today certainly Abraham said he knew what he was but 2 213 but watch what he had done there to that church elect he gave it a chance to for also for you to know him for you to see him and if you are unable to see him are you the church elect because he says what he done there to that church elect he give it a chance to see see see what I mean well my God what did he do you know we made out of 16 elements of the earth potage petroleum and Cosmic light and whatever more he just reached over and got a handful of atom and Cosmic like petroleum and said few step into it Gabriel he takes the form few step into it sister so it Tes a form few step into it brother so because Abraham said that I know him from Genesis 12 of my how he took me from a m leadership Moses will said that I know him from gen from Exodus 1 how I was the proper child now in Exodus 3 I'm standing here looking at him butam says he come also to the elect church for them also Al to know him but then in the pentagons they're seeing they they're calling out you know unidentified unidentified flying objects but to the church elect the information the understanding is given because when you were looking for him he stepped out and can helped you for a certain purpose then it goes further and takes another form to give you another much more information so you can understand and receive him and as you are receiving him it's not for you to go about just say like you know I believe the message and when he give his message to Abraham he vanish and turn right back to God again the minister after the pit it just comes back back a man again at times he becomes an introvert on the pulpit he was talking after the pulpit he's standing there he doesn't know what to tell you because the angel of the Lord just used the pottassium and the petroleum and then after what he disappeared yes sir then now to the church elect can you see the continuation how it goes from one form to another form in the midst of Babylon it comes now to tell you your strange and misunderstood life right at one time is Dad talking the next minute the angel of the Lord Billy Paul he would have stricken you dead you used to him you look at him his daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy the next minute it's not Daddy anymore then Abraham They Se after him they able to see what is going on you see he says you see and when he gives his message to Abraham he turn in and vanish and chemicals in the wood and coal and whatever burning turn back to the Unseen I'm so glad my father is like that the understanding the revelation of how he behaves of how him coming down y and how he performs we are grateful for our ministers we are grateful for our pastors we are grateful for our musicians but then the ins sign should not become the object of worship amen because the object of worship is God and no man has ever seen God and when you know how to find that God in the nature in the form in whatever situation he find himself in opening up then you conscious I am after him I am following him because pastor Pastor I have a problem pray for me Pastor I have this do this for me pastor pastor pastor pastor pastor Pastor the minute the pastor dies where is your faith what was it built upon the minute the prophecy told to William brandham doesn't come to fulfill in your lifetime where is your your faith built upon he says he also G the chance to the church elect because the angel of the Lord came from the presence of God and what's this shakina Glory today to break Beyond the Veil to see who God Is Standing before you see who God is standing here before us the pill of fire is veiled in human flesh amen praise the Lord the angel of the Lord in the form that we are looking for him not with a yesterday mindset because when the a sign becomes now a stumbling block then the Lord has to take it up and tore it apart quickly Revelation 4 people started worshiping William brandham he said but these are true Brothers they pay the tights they pay the offering but they were unable to go Beyond the Veil they said like you know this is it let's worship it and Aaron also came on the pulpit and say like this is your god worship the worship the car the golden C because they were looking for a form but the angel of the Lord said I came down to see and to the church elect something too to give them the chance but he said I am a jealous God I don't share my worship with nobody not the pastor not the prophet not the wife not the husband the husband will be so proud I will be providing for you the next minute say oh you a little too proud watch out very quickly the job is gone I've made all my investment I'm secured quickly the uh the stock market crashes where is your stand where is where is Faith anchored into and to that only to that church elect because remember NE Road was to acquire the wealth of the world to control people's mind to be made a God to be lifted up upon the stars of God and upon these stars now the chance is also given I am the only Minister who have all the Revelation all of you should listen to me really you think you know God you think you've preached it all you think you've understood it all and before you know it then job it just meant none in the city with all the Revelation then the Lord comes to him get up like a man let me talk to you where were you when I was laying the foundation of the world the man didn't have any answer David wanted to control the people when he say he said let me talk to you he said like you want to control my people you want to lift yourself above love them when I took you there behind the ship when even your brothers couldn't even see you there as a warrior did you know what your future was Samson wanted to lift himself up he said like I have the seven SE Revelations I can do I can live any kind of life you can that's right let me show you how it's done and puts him there gives the woman the mindset to how to seduce him before he knows it the the Philistines upon you but you don't know what to do anymore you thought you new at times we become our own inside right I am young I am strong I'm smart I'm beautiful I am this I am that I am this and before you know it just a little disease cripples you down all that chest is gone all that strength is gone then the Lord comes to you who are you where did you come from what is your position what is all that you you were showing off like he says I also will give a chance to the elect Church the inside the Lord is coming down is revealing Our Lives is explaining our lives at the same time now we become aware that despite of all my youth despite of all that I am I need to pledge allegiance to him not to the form because the form quickly will put me into trouble because the relationship is not between you and the in the inside but it is between you and him amen because that spiritual relationship between man and God must be restored again today that pill of fire he says but but what does the Shak what did what did he do the shbr seed the word that were that that we to live on this day by the by these promises the Shak Glory ripens that Sho bread brings it to pass makes it the bread to the to the believer that laid in the pages of the Bible year after year the word for this age to the denomination is a stumbling block the people are sitting they are looking they say like you know what is this word how come I can just have a church and be satisfied to it how come I can just have resting my resting place my my my job and everything that we can name but he said but to the believer get into that Veil get into that shoe bread when that Sho bread seed is falling to the ground watch the Sho bread take the form and the journey along your church ages of your life and then comes to maturity to produce exactly what the angel of the Lord came and said I came to explain to you your stranger misunderstood life now the believer now knows to stay focused oh what is the am I in contact with the angel of the Lord because these things should not just be sermons right because if we are sermons we read about brother Bram and counter with the angel of the lord we here encounter I'm not talking just of you having some form of a dream because he said I also give the the elect Church a chance I was there I was walking in the woods he said William Brenham do you want to walk with me because he brought him from a Mis misunderstood life to where he couldn't know if the angel of the Lord was there or not to now to the point now he could walk with him it takes them there he has to reveal to him the stages of his life and as the day the stages of his life is being revealed to him I'm not historical I'm talking about you as is revealing that to him he's becoming aware at this stage of the journey I can't be there start following ministers he went to South Africa ministers tell him you know just come with us here follow us here but the angel of the Lord said come and do what I tell you to do then when he comes back around he say what did I do why did I listen to the ministers he say if you want to get in trouble get along with the ministers because each Minister will come and tell you it's this way the next one will tell you it's that way have a convention have the same title have the ministers come this one is left up down up turn around this one contradicts this one here left and right the church elect had to understand that too just as William Bram had to understand that after understanding it then he was aware brother I hear what you say but let me c let me talk to him first and this is the place where now that same angel of the Lord who's always present in this kind of meetings will sit there and start revealing to you this word in your life yes you see that sermon for your life is this way you see this year for you it's this way by the time you walk out he's satisfied not satisfied for you to go out alone but it goes with you as the woman in the meeting they said brother I stood up there I looked and I saw the Angel of the Lord right next to you after the meeting I saw him going with you then now we become cautious how this this Angel of the Lord come down in the midst of mystery Babylon in the midst of all that Darkness it start now revealing to you what is my position what am I supposed to do how am I supposed to proceed and how am I supposed to go about this things then when we become aware of it now the word say the third stage of that journey is the message it's not finished you have to be aware what Babylon was what form it takes how it come it takes us along the way how it wants to break us apart from the rest of the surroundings and how from that surroundings now he has to reveal a message because the years of preparation precedes the message and yet throughout the years of preparation he's teaching you elements for you to be adjusted then in the years of the message then you turn around you able to understand the language that we have later on because we just write it here I'm always unable to finish my sermons went down to deliver them third was the last message I'm quoting brother bam as he's becoming aware of these things here now he says then later on because under the years of preparation you have uh Exodus 12 you have you know all the plagues and everything that followed it then until they find themselves in the wilderness then the message comes forth now with our lives how did it go did we just join the church did we just listen to Dad's religion was it just something we want about and we believe because people say like you know B Bram has has been the prophet of the age is it just because you heard of many miracles that he did that differentiated him him from the people of his time or is it just a group Gathering Oh Sister Mida dress that way I can also dress that way oh because our church dresses that way we also think that we should dress that way because it's you have those quotations in the message yes if the church believed that we shouldn't gamble we shouldn't drink and smoke and all these things here the be members of that church will not do that that you after those teachers right right though that is good but it's not enough then you go on onto a relationship with him but that's not enough because those who went after the first and the second pool didn't not all make it to the third pool then we'll see what happens after that may God bless you Miss amen let's all stand sure appreciate that brother martin this makes you want to be more sensitive to the Lord just that we just see him in our everyday life just be sensitive to his leading
