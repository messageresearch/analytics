[14:28] Doctor Who deemed his left eye a
[14:30] complete loss

[54:59] take a little bit longer so before we go
[55:02] into the word because I think some some
[55:05] things have to be said and been maybe
[55:07] able to introduced a little
[55:09] amen
[55:11] so I've I had to make little notes for
[55:14] this because I'm not very good in doing
[55:17] organized things so I might forget too
[55:21] much
[55:22] amen so I'm so glad to be here I'm so
[55:26] glad that the Lord just made a way and I
[55:29] was quite surprised when brother Ron
[55:30] found me uh or texted me some weeks ago
[55:34] and asked me to come
[55:35] and so uh I was quite surprised and I
[55:40] was happy to say yes
[55:41] to just uh to see one another back again
[55:45] after many many many years we go uh I
[55:49] don't know this I know I saw brother
[55:50] Amos and uh we know one another since
[55:55] many since uh yeah many years and also
[55:59] brother Matthew I don't know if he's
[56:01] here he's not okay and also sister
[56:04] Rebecca we remember how they were just
[56:07] uh I think uh 10 15 12 years old so we
[56:12] were just around at the farm and so the
[56:16] Lord was just gracious to us
[56:18] amen so there goes so many memories is
[56:22] there from back and that will not be the
[56:25] time now to speak about this but maybe
[56:27] tomorrow morning a little bit for the
[56:30] for the young people just something
[56:31] that's really on my heart
[56:33] uh What the Lord Has Done and also what
[56:37] he is doing I believe just this is what
[56:39] the Lord is doing right now amen and so
[56:43] I just bring the greetings I must be a
[56:44] little bit on my phone I bring the
[56:46] greetings from the church and uh in a
[56:49] northern part of Germany Wester timke
[56:51] it's a little bit difficult to pronounce
[56:53] whether it's just between Hamburg and
[56:56] Bremen and the northern part of Germany
[56:58] so we have a church there and I'm a
[57:01] pastor of the church there since many
[57:02] years since some years and uh
[57:05] um I'll try I have to introduce myself
[57:08] most of you have heard my name Andreas
[57:10] ringing Andrew ringing I'm married to my
[57:15] wife sister Claudia
[57:17] I think uh brother Ron and sister Sandy
[57:21] they know her and I'm married for four
[57:24] oh I don't know quite some years
[57:27] 30 some years we are married and we have
[57:31] 10 children by the grace of the Lord and
[57:35] they're they're all doing fine yeah for
[57:38] German is a little bit unusual I know
[57:40] that but I always say I'm not really a
[57:43] German in that sense so uh we are we are
[57:46] quite quite happy serving the lord
[57:50] amen and like I said it's going uh it's
[57:53] going quite back for many many years
[57:56] that we know uh brother Ron and sister
[57:59] Sandy the time that he was in Germany
[58:01] and uh so we uh we had some wonderful
[58:04] time and uh like brother Ron said uh I'm
[58:08] a mighty mighty move that got uh I
[58:11] believe he started and uh today by the
[58:15] grace of the Lord it is uh not less the
[58:18] the the Lord is still moving in a in a
[58:21] mighty way
[58:23] and so we're really grateful for that
[58:25] when the Lord starts something nobody
[58:28] can stop it amen amen if the Lord builds
[58:32] a house then we know what is going to to
[58:34] be and what is going to happen
[58:36] amen and so I'm I'm quite uh
[58:40] um quite just have to say a few things
[58:42] also that really
[58:43] um before we start going into the word
[58:45] that is really it was came on my heart
[58:47] why I was thinking of this anniversary
[58:50] meetings
[58:52] and that you have here and I came across
[58:55] a statement of the Prophet quite quite
[58:59] as astonished me uh I know you had the
[59:02] beginning here in uh or the starting
[59:04] 1992 brother fiscal dedication of the
[59:08] church building this was uh 30 years ago
[59:11] and uh uh brother biscal also a great
[59:15] man of God uh um a great Tool uh
[59:19] spreading the message of the hour
[59:21] amen and so uh and now 30 years later
[59:25] amen 30 years later uh it's another
[59:28] building I think uh
[59:31] uh and I believe that people are more
[59:33] molded and uh in the image of God Amen I
[59:39] believe that amen and it is not so much
[59:42] uh about the building that we are in
[59:45] because finally you are the building
[59:50] amen amen you are the house of God is
[59:54] that right amen and so we are not just
[59:56] talking of this flesh but the real you
[59:59] this is the house of God
[1:00:01] amen and so forth we are so glad to be
[1:00:04] there and I know in uh 30 years there is
[1:00:07] uh a lot of a lot of uh memories goes
[1:00:11] with that uh
[1:00:13] a lot of good memories and also
[1:00:15] sometimes not so good memories but
[1:00:18] finally we know that all things work
[1:00:21] together for good amen not all things
[1:00:24] are good but all things work together
[1:00:27] for good amen and so uh and I thought it
[1:00:30] was as I was just reading uh um it was
[1:00:33] God in simplicity
[1:00:35] was quite amazing I just came across and
[1:00:37] he and brother Adam preached uh God in
[1:00:40] Simplicity just about this just about 30
[1:00:42] years ago he just was also in March 19
[1:00:45] uh uh Now 60 years ago and sorry it was
[1:00:49] double Thirty so he preached it in March
[1:00:51] 1963 and he he's just said in that
[1:00:54] sermon uh there's really inspired me and
[1:00:57] I pray that the Lord may help us that we
[1:01:01] really understand and what great time we
[1:01:04] are in
[1:01:05] amen and he said there it is he also in
[1:01:08] 1963 they had also their 30th
[1:01:11] anniversary
[1:01:12] he said he they didn't make a big thing
[1:01:14] out of it but he said okay we are also
[1:01:16] 30 years together and they had a
[1:01:18] rededication of the building
[1:01:20] and I and then brother random actually
[1:01:23] preached the sermon got in simplicity
[1:01:26] amen and we understood what what came
[1:01:29] out from then it became at the opening
[1:01:32] of the seals game
[1:01:33] and uh a great time started for the
[1:01:37] Believers amen we believe that and I
[1:01:40] want to say another Ephesians began
[1:01:44] amen and I found it so appropriate
[1:01:46] really to understand
[1:01:49] uh that that we are here now you have
[1:01:52] your 30th anniversary and I really pray
[1:01:54] that the Lord will help us to really to
[1:01:58] understand what we are in where we are
[1:02:00] in and what time we are in and what God
[1:02:02] is doing
[1:02:04] and I just want to read the statement or
[1:02:06] a quote of that sermon God and
[1:02:08] simplicity which I felt was it's and
[1:02:11] that just felt it so wonderful also for
[1:02:14] today not only for this weekend
[1:02:16] but just in general what God is doing
[1:02:20] amen yeah it's it's quite a familiar
[1:02:23] quote brother random said he said now
[1:02:25] man has his own ideas of what God ought
[1:02:29] to be and what God is going to do
[1:02:33] and as I have made the old statement
[1:02:35] many times that man Still Remains man
[1:02:40] and I believe today is the same
[1:02:43] man is always giving God praise for what
[1:02:47] he did do and always looking forward of
[1:02:50] what he will do and ignoring what he is
[1:02:54] doing
[1:02:56] that's the way they miss it they look
[1:02:58] back and see what what a great thing he
[1:03:01] has done but they failed to see what a
[1:03:04] simple thing he used to do it with
[1:03:07] and then they look forward and see a
[1:03:10] great thing coming and it's going to
[1:03:12] happen and in nine times
[1:03:15] out of 10. it is already happening right
[1:03:18] around them
[1:03:19] and it is so simple
[1:03:21] that they don't know it
[1:03:24] Allelujah I I felt what a what
[1:03:28] appropriate thing that the prophet was
[1:03:30] saying
[1:03:31] amen and uh and I trust we just
[1:03:34] understand and believe the great thing
[1:03:37] that God is doing are you a part of the
[1:03:40] great work
[1:03:41] can we see that in our life
[1:03:44] Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today
[1:03:46] and forever
[1:03:47] hallelujah what a mighty God we serve
[1:03:49] amen and this is I I also really want
[1:03:52] this weekend as the Lord put something
[1:03:54] on my heart it has much to do with uh
[1:03:57] with the church with a building uh with
[1:04:00] uh with uh um it had a lot to do with
[1:04:03] this over the meetings that we will have
[1:04:06] and just my desire is that when we go
[1:04:09] out from here that it has become more
[1:04:11] real of what God is doing
[1:04:13] Hallelujah God bless you let us then to
[1:04:15] our feet and I just
[1:04:18] want to go
[1:04:20] to the scripture
[1:04:22] and uh

[1:04:45] Genesis we want to read from Joshua 5 2
[1:04:48] and 3. and I want to speak this evening
[1:04:50] on having inventory in the Ephesians
[1:04:56] I just want to speak on having inventory
[1:04:58] in the Ephesians not foreign Ephesians
[1:05:01] but in the Ephesians
[1:05:04] amen when we go to from Joshua we want
[1:05:07] to chapter five we want to read two
[1:05:09] verses two and three we want to read
[1:05:12] Joshua 5 verses 2 and 3. at that time
[1:05:16] the Lord said unto Joshua make these
[1:05:19] sharp knives and circumcise again the
[1:05:21] children of Israel a second time
[1:05:24] is it okay Joshua five two and three and
[1:05:27] Joshua made him sharp knives and
[1:05:29] circumcised the children of Israel at
[1:05:32] the hill
[1:05:33] of the foreskins
[1:05:34] amen now this was this was
[1:05:37] across the Jordan they have crossed the
[1:05:40] Jordan into the Promised Land
[1:05:41] amen so in here he just had a
[1:05:44] circumcision we go there maybe a little
[1:05:47] later referring back to this and then we
[1:05:49] go to when we go to Genesis the third
[1:05:52] chapter
[1:05:53] Genesis 3 and I'm just excusing myself
[1:05:55] for my for my English but trust you
[1:05:58] understand it it's not my mother tongue
[1:06:00] so sometimes it's not very easy
[1:06:02] but I trust that you understand it and
[1:06:04] if you don't understand it pray for me
[1:06:06] okay
[1:06:07] Genesis 3 verse six I just want to read
[1:06:10] only one verse
[1:06:12] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:06:15] good for food
[1:06:16] and that it was pleasant for the eyes
[1:06:20] and a tree to be desired to make one
[1:06:24] wise she took off the fruit thereof
[1:06:27] and did it and gave also unto her
[1:06:29] husband with her and he did eat
[1:06:33] and just keep in mind it was three
[1:06:35] things that is going on here
[1:06:39] it was good for food
[1:06:41] Pleasant for the eye
[1:06:43] and the tree to be desired to make one
[1:06:46] wise
[1:06:47] it was three things
[1:06:50] that if
[1:06:51] was really confronted with
[1:06:54] amen let us pray together Heavenly
[1:06:56] Father
[1:06:57] we're just so grateful that we can spend
[1:07:00] this time together
[1:07:01] father and we pray that you will come
[1:07:04] just in a special way oh God
[1:07:06] take Thy word father and you're the only
[1:07:09] one that can reveal it lord it's not the
[1:07:12] minister that can reveal it it is only
[1:07:15] you father and we pray while we speak
[1:07:17] the word and uh the people receive your
[1:07:20] word father May the Holy Spirit just
[1:07:23] reveal the word to our hearts we pray
[1:07:26] father that it is more than just an
[1:07:28] information that it is more than just
[1:07:30] hearing it again father but that it will
[1:07:33] become a life living in our hearts we
[1:07:37] pray father and may these meetings uh be
[1:07:40] just something that it is Pleasant in
[1:07:43] your eyes father we commit ourselves
[1:07:45] into your hand in the mighty name of
[1:07:48] Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you
[1:07:51] maybe see it
[1:07:52] amen
[1:07:54] so uh as we as we want to speak on on uh
[1:07:59] on uh
[1:08:00] on inventory in the Ephesians I just
[1:08:03] want to start with uh something rather
[1:08:06] Branham is saying in the message Jehovah
[1:08:08] Jireh one of the early messages brother
[1:08:10] Adam said you know he said uh and what
[1:08:13] we're looking at the Rapture is we are
[1:08:15] going to meet the coming Sun very soon
[1:08:18] we have to be changed and to be caught
[1:08:21] up he said but you can't be caught up
[1:08:24] the way you are now Ron said you are too
[1:08:28] heavy
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:31] so I found it quite quite interesting he
[1:08:34] said we are too heavy so I don't think
[1:08:36] it's the body weight that he's speaking
[1:08:37] of I think I trust not so and I think
[1:08:40] that but I believe that he was just
[1:08:43] talking and looking to people to seeing
[1:08:46] what all is upon them what they all take
[1:08:49] to themselves and he said okay the way
[1:08:51] we are now you are now that's not the
[1:08:54] way we can go there's too many things
[1:08:57] that really uh are on us and brother I'm
[1:09:00] said also this way in another sermon
[1:09:01] brother random said this is a time
[1:09:03] really has for this journey we should
[1:09:06] not pack up what we could down pack we
[1:09:09] could we should really get things off of
[1:09:11] ourselves
[1:09:13] amen because if we are too loaded if we
[1:09:17] are too occupied there's nothing God can
[1:09:20] give us
[1:09:21] amen and so I believe this is the great
[1:09:24] thing that we we see today and I believe
[1:09:27] that uh
[1:09:29] um even brother random when he in the
[1:09:31] message Feast of the trumpets
[1:09:33] brother random said at the end of the
[1:09:34] sermon 1964 and brother random it's just
[1:09:38] praying and then brother random is
[1:09:40] praying he said he said Lord I pray that
[1:09:42] each and everyone may be in maybe in
[1:09:46] inside not outside but inside truly born
[1:09:49] again
[1:09:51] he said and we who are in
[1:09:54] I believe it's especially for those
[1:09:56] people we who are in lot may we take
[1:10:00] inventory now
[1:10:02] that we have seen and heard the voice of
[1:10:05] God speaking through his word and we
[1:10:07] know that the hour that we are living in
[1:10:11] amen maybe he's just praying help us to
[1:10:14] take inventory and I believe he was
[1:10:16] speaking not just only to uh people that
[1:10:20] had problems with things of the world
[1:10:22] and but he was he was really talking to
[1:10:24] believers
[1:10:25] amen he was really talking to to the to
[1:10:28] to a person that is born again like we
[1:10:31] could see in the Garden of Eden
[1:10:33] um which was which was happening to Eve
[1:10:36] and and really I want to go uh to that
[1:10:39] what was because Eve we understand is
[1:10:41] that we are coming back we are coming
[1:10:43] back to all that Adam and Eve lost or
[1:10:46] fell from we are coming back to that and
[1:10:49] we are not far away from that
[1:10:51] we are not far away from that church
[1:10:53] amen it's just what is what is needed
[1:10:56] for is just a body change
[1:10:58] amen it's just a body change we have
[1:11:01] further than we think we are third there
[1:11:03] and we add and there's two there's so
[1:11:05] many things you know sometimes it's for
[1:11:07] us very hard and I speak from experience
[1:11:10] it's very hard to receive things from
[1:11:13] God
[1:11:14] um because we have our preconceived
[1:11:17] ideas about things
[1:11:19] amen when we when sometimes even when
[1:11:21] you come across something brother random
[1:11:24] said uh you know it's it sometimes you
[1:11:26] have to be really free to receive it
[1:11:29] not something there from somewhere from
[1:11:32] some other Church of some other opinion
[1:11:34] just laying down there and when you hear
[1:11:37] or read something that you say oh no
[1:11:39] cannot be or it doesn't mean like this
[1:11:42] but I believe we we we are the best
[1:11:45] thing is that we can receive it the way
[1:11:47] it is spoken
[1:11:49] and the message is what the prophet
[1:11:52] really brought us we understand there is
[1:11:54] a message in the message we understand
[1:11:55] that amen there is a message in the
[1:11:58] message is that right that's that's a
[1:12:01] message that is written in the message
[1:12:03] amen and the elect will receive it if
[1:12:06] they are they will receive it and if
[1:12:08] they have an open heart it comes easily
[1:12:10] to them
[1:12:11] Allelujah if there's if there's release
[1:12:13] that's why to I believe it's so
[1:12:16] important that we are we are not we are
[1:12:18] not uh we are not when we speak of
[1:12:20] inventory it is also something which is
[1:12:23] not just only for for the newcomers
[1:12:27] uh but I believe that that inventory is
[1:12:31] for for young and old for each and
[1:12:33] everyone
[1:12:33] that is here you know for each of this
[1:12:36] is for the ministers this is for male
[1:12:39] and female for young and old for the
[1:12:40] laity he said it is for especially I
[1:12:43] believe when we speak of inventory it is
[1:12:46] for the Bride of Jesus Christ because
[1:12:48] she is too important to miss what God is
[1:12:52] doing
[1:12:54] amen she is too important to miss what
[1:12:58] God is doing because God wants to do it
[1:13:01] through her
[1:13:03] that's why we shouldn't miss it
[1:13:05] amen allow me to say you are the only
[1:13:08] chance that God has
[1:13:12] to leave the promise for to live the
[1:13:15] promise for this day out
[1:13:17] you're the only chance that God has
[1:13:20] amen amen and that's why I believe this
[1:13:22] this inventory like brother random said
[1:13:25] in another sermon brother Branham said
[1:13:27] always judge your life
[1:13:29] by how don't judge your life by how much
[1:13:32] power you have to perform miracles
[1:13:36] and we don't judge ourselves by the
[1:13:39] knowledge you have of the words but
[1:13:41] always judge yourself look back and take
[1:13:44] an inventory
[1:13:46] of what kind of fruit that the life you
[1:13:50] presently live now is bearing
[1:13:53] amen as I preach and you know and it's
[1:13:55] it doesn't really help if it is not a
[1:13:57] good fruit it does not really help to
[1:14:00] cut away the fruit
[1:14:02] because the fruit comes from somewhere
[1:14:05] amen so it's not really helpful just to
[1:14:07] cut maybe the fruit off and say okay
[1:14:10] this will solve because if something is
[1:14:12] wrong with the seed
[1:14:14] that fruit will always come back again
[1:14:18] so actually it is very important that we
[1:14:21] can that we really understand that that
[1:14:23] fruit that he is talking of comes from
[1:14:25] his seed
[1:14:27] amen and that seed had to be if there's
[1:14:30] a wrong seed that seed has to be be
[1:14:32] removed
[1:14:34] because if that ground is really
[1:14:36] possessed if that ground is possessed of
[1:14:39] a wrong or yeah of a wrong seed there is
[1:14:43] no place for the right seed
[1:14:46] amen so that's why I believe we really
[1:14:48] should look like the prophet will say so
[1:14:50] don't judge your life how much power you
[1:14:53] have to perform miracles
[1:14:59] amen
[1:15:01] and we don't judge ourselves by how much
[1:15:04] knowledge we have of the words
[1:15:07] but always judge yourself look back and
[1:15:10] take inventory what kind of fruit your
[1:15:13] life is bearing
[1:15:14] what kind of fruit your life is bearing
[1:15:16] is it really the fruit that he wants to
[1:15:19] see on the tree
[1:15:20] is it really the fruit that God wants to
[1:15:23] see on the tree or is it the fruit that
[1:15:25] we want to see or somebody else wants to
[1:15:28] see
[1:15:28] amen that's why he gave his word and his
[1:15:32] word is a seed that's why he gave his
[1:15:34] word because his word will bring forth
[1:15:37] after its kind
[1:15:39] amen if his word falls into a good
[1:15:42] ground into your ground because you are
[1:15:44] the ground
[1:15:46] and if that word evolves into that
[1:15:48] ground it will bring forth after its
[1:15:51] kind and then you cannot help but but
[1:15:53] bear the fruit
[1:15:55] Hallelujah if there's a fruit if this
[1:15:59] what you bear is not the fruit for the
[1:16:01] season
[1:16:01] then there's something wrong with the
[1:16:03] seed
[1:16:06] amen so then it's time to take inventory
[1:16:10] and see what kind of seed somebody has
[1:16:13] sown
[1:16:15] what kind of seed is inside of there
[1:16:17] bringing forth that fruit
[1:16:20] amen so it's really time for I believe
[1:16:22] it's time for inventory
[1:16:24] because we understand as it was in the
[1:16:26] beginning in Genesis amen there was
[1:16:29] somebody putting the seed out
[1:16:33] amen there was somebody putting a seed
[1:16:35] out and and finally that seed was
[1:16:38] received
[1:16:40] and that seed brought forth
[1:16:43] Hallelujah that seed brought forth and
[1:16:46] Eve as a woman is the type of the church
[1:16:48] she brought forth she had she was the
[1:16:51] she was the vessel to bring forth Abel
[1:16:55] and she was the vessel to bring forth
[1:16:58] Cain
[1:16:59] Hallelujah so it depends what kind of
[1:17:01] seed is there that kind of fruit comes
[1:17:04] up so again if there's something wrong
[1:17:06] with the fruit I want to say if it is
[1:17:08] not the fruit for the season
[1:17:11] is very plain that that that we must
[1:17:15] have a fruit for this season
[1:17:18] amen not a fruit for another season
[1:17:20] which was wonderful but we need a fruit
[1:17:23] for this season it must be a word being
[1:17:25] sown in this season
[1:17:28] and if the word of God has been sown for
[1:17:31] this season in your heart it will bear
[1:17:33] the fruits
[1:17:34] if the right kind of atmosphere is
[1:17:36] created around the fruit will come up
[1:17:38] you cannot help because every seed will
[1:17:41] bring forth after its own kind
[1:17:44] Hallelujah and if God is sown into your
[1:17:47] heart what will come up
[1:17:51] Hallelujah I want to say it again if God
[1:17:53] is sown into your heart what will come
[1:17:56] up
[1:17:57] and we understand this message is
[1:18:00] nothing else than the word of God
[1:18:03] and if that word of God is sown into our
[1:18:05] hearts what do you expect to come up
[1:18:11] hallelujah what Eve received she brought
[1:18:15] forth
[1:18:16] is it right she brought forth Cain and
[1:18:19] she brought forth Abel
[1:18:24] that power is in the church
[1:18:30] and Abel was what a son of Adam
[1:18:35] which was a son of God
[1:18:38] so Abel was the son of God
[1:18:41] so that means Eve brought forth a Son of
[1:18:45] God we're speaking now the way of
[1:18:47] sexuality okay
[1:18:48] well this is the permissible we
[1:18:50] understand that
[1:18:51] amen so he should have come Abel should
[1:18:54] have come forth in a different way
[1:18:56] but because of the Fall it went that
[1:18:58] direction but look what the woman was
[1:19:00] look what she was
[1:19:01] she just brought forth what's been sown
[1:19:04] into her
[1:19:06] and then when it came up you see the
[1:19:08] fruit you saw Cain and he even said I
[1:19:11] received a son from the Lord and we
[1:19:13] understand what it was like brothers
[1:19:15] said all life comes from God
[1:19:18] so she even said that and how many
[1:19:20] people really understand where that seed
[1:19:22] comes from but you see his actions you
[1:19:25] see his life you know where his daddy
[1:19:27] was you know who is that he was and you
[1:19:30] saw Abel and you knew exactly who his
[1:19:32] daddy was
[1:19:33] both came forth via if
[1:19:37] Hallelujah so if it is not the fruit for
[1:19:40] the season that we are bearing we better
[1:19:43] watch and take care for the seeds
[1:19:46] and it's time for an inventory what kind
[1:19:50] of seed is being sown into our hearts
[1:19:53] this is what's because it's harvest time
[1:19:55] now Things become ripe things come up
[1:19:58] amen things come up and so so and if you
[1:20:01] if you really uh see if you if you see
[1:20:04] Cain and he's walking and he was a very
[1:20:06] religious guy we understand that he was
[1:20:07] a very religious man
[1:20:09] and it was not so quick to really
[1:20:12] understand who comes from whom
[1:20:15] you know what he liked to worship Ava
[1:20:18] Kane liked to worship then Abel like to
[1:20:20] worship but you are but you understood
[1:20:22] that what kind of sacrifice they brought
[1:20:26] a little bit identified
[1:20:29] who their daddy was
[1:20:32] Hallelujah and also was very striking
[1:20:35] the attitude they had
[1:20:40] many people are worried about the mark
[1:20:42] of the beast
[1:20:43] in our days you know and he was Cain was
[1:20:46] the first one who received that Mark
[1:20:48] is that right
[1:20:49] he was the first one
[1:20:51] he get it God gave it to him
[1:20:54] is it right God gave and many people
[1:20:57] today are afraid of the mark of the
[1:20:58] beast and they expected around the
[1:21:00] corner from whatever where it comes from
[1:21:03] but let me tell you you're born with it
[1:21:07] oh yeah
[1:21:08] if you're not truly born again you
[1:21:10] automatically have the mark of the beast
[1:21:13] because you're born with it this is the
[1:21:15] old nature
[1:21:16] is it right this is born in sin
[1:21:19] look how what you know why he did you
[1:21:22] know why he received that that uh that
[1:21:25] Mark actually but watch his I think
[1:21:27] really really clearly identified the
[1:21:29] mark of the beast you can see in the
[1:21:30] attitude he had
[1:21:33] amen when God told him something he had
[1:21:35] an attitude
[1:21:37] he had an attitude and that attitude
[1:21:39] came because he was a seed
[1:21:42] of the serpent
[1:21:45] that's why he had that attitude that was
[1:21:47] fruit that was coming up what kind of
[1:21:49] brother Adam said your attitude your
[1:21:52] attitude
[1:21:53] the attitude that you have that you're
[1:21:55] sitting here the attitude in what you
[1:21:57] are receiving the word
[1:21:59] the attitude if you can say Amen not to
[1:22:02] my word to what the prophet said
[1:22:04] the attitude you have represents you
[1:22:07] before the father
[1:22:10] Hallelujah if you can say Amen
[1:22:15] to everything
[1:22:17] then what said about you that represents
[1:22:20] you before the father
[1:22:21] because this only a true elective can
[1:22:24] say
[1:22:25] because he comes from God is that right
[1:22:28] and he is going back to God
[1:22:30] so what is he he's a part of God
[1:22:34] Hallelujah he's a part of God
[1:22:38] Hallelujah you were not only in God
[1:22:44] the prophet said you were not only in
[1:22:47] his thoughts
[1:22:49] he said you were his thoughts
[1:22:54] expressed
[1:22:56] in a Time ordained for you to come forth
[1:23:01] Hallelujah but if you see what what kind
[1:23:04] of what kind of fruit comes like brother
[1:23:05] random said don't identify or I say
[1:23:08] don't you say don't judge your life how
[1:23:10] much power you have to to perform
[1:23:12] miracles
[1:23:15] don't judge your life by that it's
[1:23:17] wonderful if we have power to do
[1:23:18] miracles
[1:23:19] but this is not the identification
[1:23:23] but see what kind of fruit your life is
[1:23:27] bearing what kind of fruits come forth
[1:23:31] is it really the fruit for the season
[1:23:35] is this the fruit for the hour is this
[1:23:37] the fruit of the message of the hour
[1:23:42] Hallelujah if not it's high time to take
[1:23:45] inventory
[1:23:46] and allow me to say to dig that seed up
[1:23:51] and to get it out of the ground
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:55] amen because that seed every seed
[1:23:57] ribbing Falls after his own kind
[1:23:59] you are just a womb you're just a
[1:24:01] carrier you just someone that brings it
[1:24:03] forth
[1:24:04] Hallelujah this is what Eve was
[1:24:08] this is what the womb this is that this
[1:24:11] is the work of the woman
[1:24:13] that's why God made her
[1:24:15] that she should bring forth
[1:24:18] that through her life should come forth
[1:24:21] Hallelujah spoken word life
[1:24:24] and if we are back to all that Eve lost
[1:24:29] Hallelujah
[1:24:30] so it's only you through the life of
[1:24:34] Jesus Christ can come for us today
[1:24:40] laughs
[1:24:43] okay
[1:24:45] watch the church in laodicea
[1:24:48] as we just go a little bit along and in
[1:24:51] even 2000 years back we can see us as we
[1:24:55] understand as as 2000 years as it was
[1:24:58] with the birth of uh Christ and also the
[1:25:01] birth of the church finally and we
[1:25:03] understand that we are not living in the
[1:25:05] hour of the birth of the church
[1:25:07] we are living in the hour of the
[1:25:09] adoption of the church
[1:25:11] is that right
[1:25:13] in the birth of the church was at
[1:25:15] Pentecost
[1:25:16] amen but this is not just the birth of
[1:25:18] the church
[1:25:19] this is the adoption you know her
[1:25:21] brother said how every birth is like a
[1:25:25] mess it's a little bit like a confusion
[1:25:27] but he never said that about adoption
[1:25:31] he never said that about adoption
[1:25:34] so every church is really adopted and
[1:25:36] people just want to go back which is
[1:25:38] wonderful but we don't go back to our
[1:25:41] birth
[1:25:43] we now go we know we are coming to
[1:25:45] Perfection we're coming to adoption
[1:25:49] and this is where the church is coming
[1:25:51] to right that's why we don't expect
[1:25:54] confusion sorry to say so but the fruit
[1:25:57] of this word the fruit of this seed will
[1:26:00] not be a kind of confusion
[1:26:02] [Applause]
[1:26:03] man it's true so if it if it carries the
[1:26:07] if the fruit comes up of uh of now I
[1:26:10] don't want to say that because I don't
[1:26:12] want to confuse anyone
[1:26:13] you see but this is a different time
[1:26:17] Hallelujah this is not this is the this
[1:26:19] is really the result what happened at
[1:26:21] the upper room
[1:26:23] this is a final conclusion of it a son
[1:26:26] is being born to finally be adopted
[1:26:30] and brother Adam said the same father
[1:26:32] that gives them birth is the same father
[1:26:35] that puts him into place
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:26:40] is that right it is the same father that
[1:26:43] gives you the birth and that is a
[1:26:45] confusion that is a mess
[1:26:47] amen but that same father gives you
[1:26:50] adoption this is no mess anymore
[1:26:54] so what fruit is coming up in the church
[1:26:57] today
[1:26:59] what fruit are we bearing
[1:27:03] to just to make it clear are we bearing
[1:27:06] the fruit of the birth
[1:27:08] or are we bearing the fruit of adoption
[1:27:14] what are we expecting
[1:27:16] what are we expecting what are we
[1:27:19] expecting the Church of the Living God
[1:27:21] is going into now
[1:27:26] I believe God is tired
[1:27:30] I believe God is tired just to talk
[1:27:33] to little children
[1:27:37] he did it for so long
[1:27:40] he did it for so long he couldn't talk
[1:27:42] to the people like you wanted to talk to
[1:27:44] them
[1:27:46] because down to the church ages people
[1:27:49] did not fully understood their position
[1:27:53] they they came to his kind of adoption
[1:27:55] or you know the head there they had
[1:27:57] their adoptions every every you know
[1:27:59] every Church age had that time to come
[1:28:01] up but never to a place that is ordained
[1:28:05] now
[1:28:07] is that right and God in this our church
[1:28:09] God in this hour he he don't want to
[1:28:12] talk to children that don't really
[1:28:14] listen
[1:28:15] that they are so uh so caught up in
[1:28:18] emotions and in and move he he just want
[1:28:21] to talk to a bride now
[1:28:24] because what he wants to tell him now
[1:28:26] need to be received
[1:28:30] Hallelujah and you know somebody's
[1:28:32] really so excited he's not listening
[1:28:34] what you're saying
[1:28:36] he's so caught up but God wants to speak
[1:28:39] today and I believe he's doing it today
[1:28:41] you watch the Ministries you what what
[1:28:43] comes via this Pulpit you can see God is
[1:28:46] trying to give us something God is
[1:28:48] trying to tell us something and it must
[1:28:51] be received
[1:28:53] it must be received Church
[1:28:56] we are coming to maturity
[1:28:59] God waited so long
[1:29:01] two thousand years he waited
[1:29:04] he saw his church
[1:29:06] that was born in the upper room he saw
[1:29:09] that church dying
[1:29:13] not just only in nicaea
[1:29:16] but already the first church Edge
[1:29:18] brother and said was a fallen woman
[1:29:22] we don't have time to go in there
[1:29:24] tonight but it's already the first
[1:29:26] church age was deceived
[1:29:29] is it right when Paul
[1:29:32] when Paul came finally to the church
[1:29:35] it was already a fallen woman
[1:29:44] amen
[1:29:45] deceived like Eve
[1:29:50] and the deception was so good
[1:29:53] that even brother Branham thought
[1:29:56] it is the Holy Ghost
[1:29:59] he thought the white horse rider
[1:30:03] is that right
[1:30:05] but when the Lord told him he understood
[1:30:06] my goodness
[1:30:08] what is that for a deception
[1:30:11] and you know the deceiving part is
[1:30:13] always the White and the the white
[1:30:15] element
[1:30:16] that is a deceiving part and we
[1:30:18] understand we are living in a time where
[1:30:20] the Pale Horse is about or riding we're
[1:30:22] about to write
[1:30:23] and the deceiving thing in the Pale
[1:30:26] Horse is the white element
[1:30:28] black you understand red you understand
[1:30:30] but the white element makes him so
[1:30:32] deceptive
[1:30:34] this is how it was in the Beginning
[1:30:36] Church
[1:30:37] you know the first church the first
[1:30:40] church fell and when Paul and this
[1:30:43] amazing you God had a plan isn't that
[1:30:44] wonderful God has a plan he has
[1:30:46] everything under control
[1:30:48] and because he knew that he wanted to
[1:30:50] express further details of himself
[1:30:54] that's why he allowed the first church
[1:30:56] to fall that's why he allowed Eve to
[1:30:58] fall because his plan was to unveil more
[1:31:02] details of him
[1:31:04] to show more who he is
[1:31:07] Hallelujah that's why he made Man In His
[1:31:10] Image and he told them multiply and
[1:31:13] replenish the Earth
[1:31:19] but we understand when Paul came when
[1:31:22] Paul came to the church the church was
[1:31:25] already a fallen woman
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:30] amen
[1:31:32] the Holy Ghost filled Church
[1:31:37] that was born at the day of Pentecost
[1:31:40] was a fallen woman
[1:31:47] amen
[1:31:49] when Paul came
[1:31:52] he saw straight away
[1:31:54] where the deception Lays
[1:31:58] if Paul would be in the upper room
[1:32:01] no deception
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:11] amen but God planted like this
[1:32:13] he kept Paul back
[1:32:17] and Paul was later so frustrated he said
[1:32:20] I'm born out of season
[1:32:23] we understood if I would be there in the
[1:32:26] upper room this did not happen
[1:32:29] Paul understood that
[1:32:31] Hallelujah because he knew exactly
[1:32:34] straight from the beginning he would he
[1:32:36] could discern
[1:32:37] he could see he was it was like Adam if
[1:32:41] Adam wouldn't have been away from Eve
[1:32:44] but God just allowed him to be away from
[1:32:46] Eve
[1:32:47] so that this guy could come in and
[1:32:51] deceive her with the things that we have
[1:32:52] read in Genesis 3.
[1:32:54] and like I said keep those three things
[1:32:56] there
[1:32:57] with you because they will they will
[1:32:59] they they those are things that confront
[1:33:03] you in life every day
[1:33:06] and I'm so glad we had a prophet to tell
[1:33:08] us this
[1:33:10] because in this hour
[1:33:12] no deception possible
[1:33:15] you know why
[1:33:17] amen because we had a prophet
[1:33:20] amen we had a prophet and in this day he
[1:33:24] was even the first one
[1:33:28] Hallelujah
[1:33:30] so there's no deception possible
[1:33:34] can we can we say can I hear an amen
[1:33:36] when the prophet is there no deception
[1:33:41] Adam was a prophet if he would be around
[1:33:43] no deception
[1:33:45] he would plainly tell Eve don't receive
[1:33:47] it
[1:33:48] don't receive it
[1:33:50] stay free for me
[1:33:52] he would tell her
[1:33:54] don't receive it
[1:33:55] don't get occupy don't get defiled
[1:33:59] stay free for me
[1:34:01] because you are made for me you are my
[1:34:04] womb
[1:34:07] when finally when finally you know that
[1:34:10] debt that uh that the woman was when
[1:34:12] Adam identified her
[1:34:15] when Adam identified the woman at that
[1:34:18] time she did not had a name
[1:34:20] when he identified her
[1:34:22] their name was called Adam is it right
[1:34:27] amen
[1:34:28] so his name was her name
[1:34:33] amen and then he was she was taken out
[1:34:36] of man
[1:34:37] you know that that command that
[1:34:40] commission multiplying through replenish
[1:34:42] the Earth
[1:34:43] was given in the spirit form
[1:34:48] to be acted out
[1:34:51] to be acted out in dust form
[1:35:00] Hallelujah
[1:35:02] amen
[1:35:04] so we understand or we we slowly start
[1:35:07] understanding what God has in his mind
[1:35:10] what Redemption means
[1:35:12] we sing that song Redemption by Blood
[1:35:15] do you believe that he died for you
[1:35:18] do you believe he paid the price
[1:35:21] for what
[1:35:25] for all
[1:35:29] is it right when he said it's finished
[1:35:31] and he paid the price
[1:35:34] he said it's finished
[1:35:38] salvation was complete
[1:35:42] so he paid the price for all
[1:35:46] that Adam and Eve lost
[1:35:53] Hallelujah that's what Seven Angels Came
[1:35:57] to declare
[1:36:00] that's why this message is different
[1:36:05] that's why there's a change in the
[1:36:07] ministry of William Brennan
[1:36:10] that's why the messenger the prophet of
[1:36:12] this age
[1:36:14] is not just William Branham
[1:36:16] but the Holy Ghost himself
[1:36:19] [Applause]
[1:36:22] Hallelujah
[1:36:24] amen we might go there on Sunday a
[1:36:26] little bit and and I was so amazed to
[1:36:28] see things which I always believed and
[1:36:31] always read how real they are
[1:36:34] that's my seventh angel came to declare
[1:36:38] Hallelujah that's that's that this is
[1:36:41] actually the change in the like brother
[1:36:43] Adam said you will see a change in my
[1:36:45] Ministry
[1:36:47] this is what we call the son of man
[1:36:50] Ministry
[1:36:51] is it right
[1:36:53] not only the church H messenger
[1:36:57] but the son of man
[1:37:01] revealed again
[1:37:04] this is the hour that we're living in
[1:37:07] and that revealing of the son of man did
[1:37:10] not end it with William Branham
[1:37:15] that Ministry is still going on
[1:37:19] and we see even a greater revealing
[1:37:23] and failing of God in this hour
[1:37:29] if we have open eyes Hallelujah if
[1:37:33] there's not a seed in US
[1:37:36] blocking that
[1:37:38] something is being sown by the way
[1:37:41] in our walk in our daily walk in our
[1:37:44] lives something that we just picked up
[1:37:46] Satan is busy trying to throw everything
[1:37:49] at you
[1:37:50] everything
[1:37:52] and I speak of truly born-again
[1:37:54] believers
[1:37:56] so it's not just throwing things of the
[1:37:58] world against you but he's throwing good
[1:38:02] things at you
[1:38:05] very good things at you
[1:38:07] because what he was throwing to Eve hey
[1:38:11] it was very good
[1:38:14] is it right yeah
[1:38:16] so you never just said to you come on
[1:38:18] have let's have sex with one another no
[1:38:22] no he just presented it differently
[1:38:27] amen
[1:38:29] so that finally she said oh that's good
[1:38:32] and she took from the fruit
[1:38:35] amen it was her allowing him to come
[1:38:39] into her
[1:38:44] Allelujah he's coming today in such I
[1:38:47] don't want to make I don't want to
[1:38:49] anybody to be afraid but just be aware
[1:38:53] we should not be afraid of the enemy but
[1:38:56] we should be aware of him
[1:38:58] brother I'm said to overcome and to
[1:39:00] overcome I will sit with him in his
[1:39:02] strong to overcome means that you that
[1:39:04] you understand every trick of the enemy
[1:39:07] is that right and here came Paul and he
[1:39:10] saw the trick of the enemy
[1:39:12] saw it straight away
[1:39:14] that's why he could really correct Peter
[1:39:17] he could tell him hey what are you doing
[1:39:22] what are you trying to get results
[1:39:25] what are you trying to force out of the
[1:39:27] people right
[1:39:28] he could tell that because he saw this
[1:39:31] sorry when I say that
[1:39:33] he saw this is the Antichrist spirit
[1:39:40] amen working through Peter yeah sure
[1:39:46] amen
[1:39:50] to Holy to a holy ghost filled vessel
[1:39:52] Yeshua
[1:39:56] when Paul came to the church
[1:39:58] to that great church of Pentecost
[1:40:01] he said brother Branham said that group
[1:40:03] or that church was already a fallen a
[1:40:05] defiled woman
[1:40:08] you mean the Holy Ghost filled people
[1:40:10] they were defiled yes
[1:40:16] so not to be afraid of nothing but just
[1:40:19] to be aware
[1:40:21] just let us raise the level of awareness
[1:40:25] that we understand how the enemy is
[1:40:28] trying to come around the corner
[1:40:29] especially to Born Again Believers in
[1:40:32] this message he knows he's not getting
[1:40:35] you with any kind of else than with
[1:40:37] quotes
[1:40:40] that's why he came to Jesus with it is
[1:40:42] written right he knew exactly he
[1:40:44] couldn't cut he couldn't he shouldn't
[1:40:46] come in any other way so he came to him
[1:40:48] it is written Jesus said I know it is
[1:40:51] written but it is also written
[1:40:53] you know why he could not be deceived
[1:40:55] because he was the word and you know why
[1:40:58] you cannot be deceived because you are
[1:41:01] the word
[1:41:05] [Applause]
[1:41:07] that's why you cannot be deceived
[1:41:10] why I need a prophet to tell you that
[1:41:14] you need a prophet to tell you that
[1:41:18] Hallelujah that's why you need a prophet
[1:41:21] if needed Adam to tell her
[1:41:29] um
[1:41:30] Hallelujah because you are predestinated
[1:41:33] in this hour not to be deceived
[1:41:37] that's why God sent a message a
[1:41:39] messenger to tell you that who you are
[1:41:42] and if you understand you are a part of
[1:41:44] God
[1:41:46] can God be deceived
[1:41:49] how in the world you
[1:41:55] Hallelujah well the message we have
[1:41:58] received judge
[1:41:59] oh it's time for an inventory
[1:42:03] it's time for an inventory to see what
[1:42:07] is coming up inside of me what is start
[1:42:09] growing
[1:42:11] what is becoming fruit
[1:42:14] is it really the fruit of the season
[1:42:17] is it really a fruit of maturity
[1:42:24] Hallelujah and if not have the courage
[1:42:28] to set out to Satan
[1:42:30] it is also written
[1:42:34] I hope I can speak like this
[1:42:37] but I know you are you are you know I
[1:42:39] know brother on so I know what he
[1:42:41] believes I know that you also believing
[1:42:43] it is that right
[1:42:45] amen so you understand so the Deception
[1:42:48] comes by the word
[1:42:53] Hallelujah not by the message of the
[1:42:56] hour
[1:42:58] but by the word
[1:43:01] and Satan is clever
[1:43:03] he is clever like he was with Eve like
[1:43:06] he was with a woman
[1:43:07] Oh my he knew exactly where to go to
[1:43:14] yeah he didn't he did not he wouldn't go
[1:43:17] to Adam
[1:43:19] he wouldn't
[1:43:22] and he wouldn't go to ease
[1:43:26] the time when she was still in Adam
[1:43:30] but he came to her
[1:43:32] when she was taken out of him
[1:43:34] he came to her when she was identified
[1:43:43] when there was an Adam
[1:43:45] telling her
[1:43:49] you are
[1:43:50] bone
[1:43:51] of my bone
[1:43:54] you are
[1:43:57] flesh
[1:43:58] of My Flesh
[1:44:01] now this doesn't speak of humanity
[1:44:06] you are Flesh of My Flesh
[1:44:10] you are me
[1:44:14] and what was her name
[1:44:18] what did he call her
[1:44:23] he called her a position
[1:44:31] amen
[1:44:32] he said I you are the woman
[1:44:37] with other words
[1:44:39] you are the womb
[1:44:41] of the man
[1:44:45] Adam God had taken the womb out of Adam
[1:44:55] and you know that womb for what it is
[1:44:57] there
[1:45:03] I can do I can stand on my head I cannot
[1:45:06] produce children or bring false children
[1:45:10] I can do whatever I want
[1:45:13] well the children are inside of me I Got
[1:45:15] Talented they were all inside of me
[1:45:18] but I had no chance to bring them forth
[1:45:21] unless I find my womb
[1:45:27] and brother said if you find the girl if
[1:45:30] you find a man that you love you don't
[1:45:32] know why
[1:45:35] amen you don't know why he said you find
[1:45:38] someone is only one not two no three is
[1:45:41] only one
[1:45:44] Adam had no choice
[1:45:48] she was the only one
[1:45:51] [Applause]
[1:45:53] well it's very simple God didn't make
[1:45:55] two and said you choose
[1:45:57] he just said this is what it is
[1:46:03] and this is also how it is with us
[1:46:10] Hallelujah
[1:46:11] amen and you know I can how how much
[1:46:14] ever children are inside of me that's
[1:46:16] wonderful and they're in me crying for
[1:46:20] expression
[1:46:24] Hallelujah and the only way to let them
[1:46:27] come forth
[1:46:28] is to my womb
[1:46:31] and this is how you fall in love with
[1:46:33] someone
[1:46:35] has nothing to do so much with sexuality
[1:46:37] but I'm said listen he said when you
[1:46:40] when you meet a woman
[1:46:42] and the woman meets a man and you love
[1:46:44] one another and you don't know really
[1:46:46] why
[1:46:49] you found the right one
[1:46:51] he said you are mates for eternity
[1:46:56] did he say that
[1:46:58] amen
[1:47:00] he said you are mates for eternity
[1:47:07] Hallelujah
[1:47:08] amen because just to show
[1:47:12] that the womb belongs to the man
[1:47:16] the womb is actually the man in another
[1:47:18] form
[1:47:22] and this is what the woman was
[1:47:25] that's why Adam had no choice
[1:47:29] Adam laughed laughed if so much
[1:47:35] his love was elective
[1:47:40] amen is it right his love must have been
[1:47:43] effective
[1:47:45] don't bring too much humanism inside of
[1:47:48] it
[1:47:50] his love was elective
[1:47:52] because he understand without her I can
[1:47:55] do nothing
[1:47:58] Hallelujah he understood that and Church
[1:48:01] Without You
[1:48:04] [Applause]
[1:48:08] Christ
[1:48:10] can do nothing
[1:48:13] that's why he died for you
[1:48:17] that's why he died for you
[1:48:19] because he needs you
[1:48:23] Hallelujah
[1:48:25] there she was at Calvary how roll around
[1:48:27] him tried to show it
[1:48:29] that Calvary she came at like Adam was
[1:48:31] put into sleep Oh Glory like Adam was
[1:48:34] put into sleep
[1:48:36] yeah and it was put into sleep said Adam
[1:48:39] you have nothing to do with this this is
[1:48:42] my work God said this is my work
[1:48:45] because I have a plan Adam did not have
[1:48:48] to plan God had to plan
[1:48:49] [Applause]
[1:48:52] allow me to say
[1:48:54] I hope you understand that Christ don't
[1:48:56] have the plan
[1:48:58] God has the plan
[1:49:00] and he transferred the plan into Christ
[1:49:04] and this plan is transferred into the
[1:49:06] church now she understands she knows
[1:49:09] what it is and the prophet said when she
[1:49:12] knows what it is the rapture will go
[1:49:15] she understands her position
[1:49:17] [Applause]
[1:49:23] oh my it's time for inventory
[1:49:26] like inventory not just don't drink
[1:49:29] don't smoke
[1:49:31] if you still do that you must be born
[1:49:32] again
[1:49:34] but now we are speaking of adoption
[1:49:36] Church
[1:49:37] now we are coming to to the reel to the
[1:49:40] fall to the real birth
[1:49:43] let me say that to birth brother random
[1:49:46] said a new birth according to Malachi 4.
[1:49:51] did he say that
[1:49:53] not a new birth according to what the
[1:49:55] head in the church ages
[1:49:57] but he knew birth according to Malachi
[1:49:59] 4.
[1:50:05] Hallelujah
[1:50:07] and this is this is what the church is
[1:50:10] who he was and then when Adam excuse me
[1:50:12] I just must must try to to Really follow
[1:50:14] the track otherwise really
[1:50:16] we will be here tomorrow
[1:50:19] now I trust we have three services we
[1:50:21] can a little bit but it's always like
[1:50:23] this when you start something it's very
[1:50:25] difficult to stop
[1:50:27] amen because because you just see what
[1:50:30] God is doing and I personally I'm just
[1:50:32] trusting I absolutely I'm depending on
[1:50:35] the leadership of the Lord absolutely
[1:50:38] I have my thoughts I have my ideas but I
[1:50:40] said Lord
[1:50:41] whatsoever that is because I know
[1:50:44] bright material is sitting here I know
[1:50:46] that I just know that
[1:50:50] and I believe you can believe that
[1:50:53] if that's if you don't believe that you
[1:50:55] are the one that something is wrong with
[1:50:57] your faith
[1:51:01] don't hope don't guess
[1:51:04] God wants you to be sure
[1:51:07] because this is the hour where he wants
[1:51:09] to treat that woman like an adult woman
[1:51:12] like a mature lady
[1:51:14] he wants to talk to us through the blood
[1:51:17] of Jesus Christ for sure
[1:51:19] so he wants you to stay under the blood
[1:51:23] because until you understand under the
[1:51:25] it is finished
[1:51:27] everything that every Redemptive
[1:51:30] blessing was paid for
[1:51:33] glorious
[1:51:35] and he wants you to stand under the
[1:51:37] blood
[1:51:38] because if you're under the blood he can
[1:51:39] talk to you
[1:51:43] amen he's tired
[1:51:45] of not being able to talk to his wife
[1:51:48] to the church he died for
[1:51:52] he wants to talk to her
[1:51:55] he wants to have fellowship with her
[1:51:56] like God had fellowship with Adam and
[1:51:59] Eve in the beginning
[1:52:04] judge we are back
[1:52:06] I believe we are back
[1:52:09] what is just missing is the body change
[1:52:12] but we are back
[1:52:14] the price was paid for this
[1:52:16] Hallelujah the price was paid for this
[1:52:18] that we come to the time that we realize
[1:52:21] he's talking about us he's talking about
[1:52:24] me
[1:52:29] Hallelujah
[1:52:30] amen so he just you know this is
[1:52:33] actually where
[1:52:34] if we come but if we come to that maybe
[1:52:37] this evening we will see
[1:52:40] but you see how how many times things
[1:52:44] that
[1:52:45] Satan has thrown at us in our life
[1:52:51] occupies us
[1:53:00] look at the woman at the well
[1:53:04] was she a predestinated seat
[1:53:07] she was
[1:53:09] Jesus came to her waiting for her and
[1:53:12] the Bible said he had to go to a certain
[1:53:14] City
[1:53:20] there was a precinated seat there
[1:53:24] so he went there
[1:53:26] and when he found her
[1:53:29] he could do nothing for her
[1:53:34] first
[1:53:36] he had to have an inventory talk with
[1:53:38] her
[1:53:42] life
[1:53:44] the enemy circumstances
[1:53:47] has thrown so many things at her
[1:53:52] so he said woman
[1:53:55] give me a drink
[1:53:58] he wasn't he couldn't come out straight
[1:54:01] even if he knew
[1:54:04] and I believe he knew from the beginning
[1:54:05] who that was
[1:54:07] but he couldn't talk to her like this
[1:54:10] Hallelujah but I believe in his heart he
[1:54:12] had a desire
[1:54:14] to tell her this is who you are
[1:54:17] Hallelujah you believe God has a desire
[1:54:20] to tell you who you are
[1:54:23] he's tired of playing hide and seek
[1:54:27] one day you were in one day you're out
[1:54:30] he's tired of that
[1:54:32] he said hey I died for you
[1:54:37] so he came here he came to the woman at
[1:54:39] the well and he saw a city he came to
[1:54:41] you say hey that he knew he went he said
[1:54:43] woman give me a drink
[1:54:46] oh she said you know uh we are we are
[1:54:49] Samaritans you know and we have no no
[1:54:51] customs of you know sharing it together
[1:54:54] we should with your you know where you
[1:54:56] come from
[1:54:57] you know why
[1:54:59] she was so occupied
[1:55:02] she was so full of it
[1:55:05] that he first had to really remove
[1:55:07] things
[1:55:09] so it was an inventory talk he talked
[1:55:11] with her
[1:55:12] so while he was going on you know he
[1:55:14] understood really where things were laid
[1:55:17] and what so finally he said you know he
[1:55:19] he she came to quite a bit
[1:55:22] after a while she understood and she
[1:55:25] recognized okay this guy is not a Jew
[1:55:29] he's not a Jew oh you must be
[1:55:32] one of the prophets
[1:55:37] and this is where many message believers
[1:55:39] stop
[1:55:42] they just knows God sent a prophet
[1:55:52] amen but he didn't came to her
[1:55:54] that she to recognize make her recognize
[1:55:57] that he was a prophet
[1:56:00] recognizing him as a prophet
[1:56:03] did not deliver her totally
[1:56:06] recognizing he was a prophet
[1:56:09] did not brought her to her position
[1:56:14] Hallelujah
[1:56:16] only when she saw this is a messiah
[1:56:20] she came to herself
[1:56:22] you know why because she was a part of
[1:56:25] him
[1:56:31] that gave her the power to live the
[1:56:33] right kind of life
[1:56:35] not just she understood God sent a
[1:56:37] prophet
[1:56:39] God did not send us the prophet to me
[1:56:42] the Messiah came
[1:56:44] not William Branham for sure not
[1:56:47] but Jesus Christ I can see
[1:56:51] the Messiah is here right
[1:56:53] how do I know that because I am a part
[1:56:55] of that
[1:56:56] [Applause]
[1:56:59] if you
[1:57:01] do you believe that word is Eagle food
[1:57:09] then according to brother random you
[1:57:11] have heard from your tophany
[1:57:16] is that correct
[1:57:18] you have a body waiting
[1:57:21] you are a part of God
[1:57:24] because that body is a part of God
[1:57:27] is that right that body is a thought of
[1:57:30] God
[1:57:31] that body is a part of God that Waits
[1:57:34] For You
[1:57:35] shows you that you are a part of him
[1:57:37] make you recognize that word to be Eagle
[1:57:40] food
[1:57:43] and when you realize that word is Eagle
[1:57:45] food you leave all other things behind
[1:57:47] you
[1:57:48] because you have found Who You Are
[1:57:53] and when an eagle understands not just
[1:57:56] its mama
[1:57:57] but when an eagle understands that's me
[1:58:01] when the eagle understands not against
[1:58:03] mama and papa flying there when the the
[1:58:06] little legal understands hey
[1:58:11] they can do it
[1:58:13] if they can do it
[1:58:16] and mama said yes
[1:58:18] because I can do it you can do it also
[1:58:26] this is when we understand and realize
[1:58:28] what God really what this message came
[1:58:30] for church
[1:58:31] but you see so many things have uh by by
[1:58:35] the time and and by time and Satan is so
[1:58:38] clever
[1:58:39] especially with these modern media
[1:58:41] Church
[1:58:42] we see Smart in he's bombarding you
[1:58:45] 24 7. he's just bombarding you
[1:58:49] with all kinds of
[1:58:52] nonsense yes I must say it with all
[1:58:55] kinds of good religious nonsense
[1:58:57] my goodness what came up what came up
[1:59:00] even through during this covet season
[1:59:02] what kind of ideas came up I taught a
[1:59:05] church at home forget about most of it
[1:59:07] is denomination and nonsense just that
[1:59:09] simple
[1:59:12] because you never hear the prophet speak
[1:59:13] about it
[1:59:16] but Dr Solomon though said something on
[1:59:18] YouTube or or Mr so-and-so or or
[1:59:21] whatever send some news about uh YouTube
[1:59:24] and people receive it
[1:59:28] and make an issue out of it in the
[1:59:30] church
[1:59:31] I always tell the church I said if you
[1:59:33] make an issue out of something have to
[1:59:35] profit for it please
[1:59:36] have the prophet for it
[1:59:43] the mark of the beast truly is not in
[1:59:46] that sense you know what we can count
[1:59:47] together 666. you can find that in
[1:59:50] denomination
[1:59:54] amen he but he was the prophet
[1:59:57] oh
[1:59:58] you know what he made for a statement
[2:00:01] he spoke about the foolish virgin
[2:00:04] that's brother Branham now
[2:00:07] he said the foolish virgin had the mark
[2:00:09] of the beast
[2:00:12] you know why
[2:00:14] because of her attitude
[2:00:20] and what she did to the wise virgin
[2:00:23] you know when Cain
[2:00:26] poof
[2:00:27] my goodness
[2:00:29] Locane
[2:00:31] God told him something
[2:00:32] and he said am I My Brother's Keeper
[2:00:37] what is a fun attitude
[2:00:39] God's speaking to you
[2:00:44] oh my
[2:00:46] God was even telling him God giving him
[2:00:49] the chance
[2:00:51] do like your brother
[2:00:59] right is it right he said to Cain
[2:01:01] do like and brother random said he even
[2:01:04] put the lamb before Cain's door
[2:01:12] and said to him do like your brother
[2:01:15] and Cain said no
[2:01:18] he couldn't say yes
[2:01:22] because there was nothing in him to say
[2:01:24] yes
[2:01:26] that's why he got a mark
[2:01:29] that Mark was be careful
[2:01:32] or
[2:01:33] feel sorry he's just a beast
[2:01:36] not you for sure okay
[2:01:42] is that right
[2:01:46] so he get the email Mark for protection
[2:01:50] is that right
[2:01:52] and just to let the people know and
[2:01:54] don't use it for reproduction
[2:02:00] hmm
[2:02:02] amen and then the Bible said after all
[2:02:05] this and Cain went away from the Lord
[2:02:09] he went away from the Lord
[2:02:12] it never was spoken about Abel
[2:02:17] Abel never went away from the Lord
[2:02:20] he couldn't
[2:02:22] because he was the son of God
[2:02:27] but Cain you understand and brother Adam
[2:02:30] said about
[2:02:31] the foolish virgin you see her attitude
[2:02:34] see her attitude
[2:02:39] when they woke up and you know asleep I
[2:02:42] was woke up and one had enough oil and
[2:02:46] the other one not the first thing that
[2:02:49] the foolish virgin said give us of your
[2:02:51] oil
[2:02:52] what is selfish attitude
[2:02:58] is that right
[2:03:00] oh church let us let us really be aware
[2:03:03] and awake
[2:03:05] and then the wife said
[2:03:08] you go
[2:03:10] and buy yourself
[2:03:12] and they left the presence of the wise
[2:03:17] virgin like Cain left the presence of
[2:03:20] God
[2:03:25] if that woman that foolish woman she was
[2:03:27] really foolish
[2:03:30] why would she not stay with the wife
[2:03:36] amen
[2:03:38] why she wouldn't stay with the wise
[2:03:42] why she could not humble themself
[2:03:49] amen
[2:03:51] so we see today
[2:03:53] what kind of attitude
[2:03:55] do we remember in the days go back in
[2:03:58] the days Old Testament he was the Ruth
[2:04:00] and now Naomi Ruth and offer
[2:04:04] and there came a day when
[2:04:06] when you know really life went wrong and
[2:04:09] things had messed up
[2:04:11] both of them
[2:04:13] Ruth and Alpha had similar same problems
[2:04:16] husband died
[2:04:18] there was a really an effects and now
[2:04:20] they was on the on the walk with Naomi
[2:04:22] back and suddenly Naomi said you know
[2:04:24] that makes no sense
[2:04:25] what you're doing here
[2:04:27] I cannot have children and boys that you
[2:04:31] can marry later which was the law in
[2:04:33] that time which that you marry and so
[2:04:36] just please go back go back to where you
[2:04:39] come from Mary get get another man be
[2:04:42] happy
[2:04:43] and both of them said no no no no
[2:04:46] and then after a while really you know
[2:04:47] we said no no no really be honest with
[2:04:49] one another surely told truth she said
[2:04:52] Ruth please go back if you love me go
[2:04:54] back
[2:04:59] and Ruth that don't talk to me like this
[2:05:07] offer accept it
[2:05:13] amen
[2:05:15] Ruth couldn't accept
[2:05:17] she said but you understand how God is
[2:05:21] proving who you are
[2:05:24] oh we have we have to understand today
[2:05:27] God in the way how he is doing things
[2:05:34] this was just proving who she was
[2:05:40] said she was a predestinated seat
[2:05:44] a part that belongs into the lineage of
[2:05:48] Jesus Christ
[2:05:53] that's why you find her in Matthew 1.
[2:05:59] that's why you find her there you know
[2:06:02] why because she wasn't part of him
[2:06:06] identified in God's own special way God
[2:06:10] is not treating us as little babies
[2:06:12] anymore Church
[2:06:14] he believes who you are he knows who you
[2:06:17] are that's why he can allow difficult
[2:06:19] things come upon you
[2:06:21] that's why he can allow even sickness to
[2:06:23] come upon you he can allow all kinds of
[2:06:26] things to come upon you because he knows
[2:06:29] who you are and now he's proving to
[2:06:31] Satan you can do with them whatever you
[2:06:34] want they cannot say no
[2:06:36] [Applause]
[2:06:38] you know one day there was there was
[2:06:41] Scott and Satan Satan came before God in
[2:06:43] his head and God said hey satan where
[2:06:47] did he come from yeah from going around
[2:06:48] the world you know looking up and down
[2:06:50] and
[2:06:51] and then God said by the way have you
[2:06:54] considered my servant job
[2:07:01] it was not Satan putting the attention
[2:07:04] on job
[2:07:07] it was God
[2:07:10] to make Satan attentive of job
[2:07:15] you know why because God knows who he is
[2:07:23] and God wants to prove who he is
[2:07:26] and he has his own way of proving who he
[2:07:29] is
[2:07:30] and we have to understand as a mature
[2:07:32] church we have to understand him today
[2:07:34] in his ways Church
[2:07:37] the Bible tells us
[2:07:41] and one of the Psalms
[2:07:43] that God is complaining
[2:07:48] and he said Moses
[2:07:51] knows me
[2:07:53] in my ways
[2:07:55] but Israel just knows me in my Act
[2:08:03] and God said I'm tired of it
[2:08:07] they just know me in my Act
[2:08:10] when they see an act of me he's here he
[2:08:12] said he said we follow you
[2:08:15] if they don't see an act
[2:08:20] do you come to church because you see
[2:08:23] signs and wonders
[2:08:26] do you just come to church because oh
[2:08:28] there's a move of God
[2:08:32] or you come to church because you are
[2:08:34] the move of God
[2:08:38] this is what the judge must be
[2:08:41] not just coming to a move but becoming
[2:08:43] the move
[2:08:48] Hallelujah
[2:08:50] and God you can read it and God was
[2:08:52] finally with Israel so tired he said 40
[2:08:54] years 40 years
[2:08:57] I have shown signs and wonders I have
[2:09:00] did everything and still they don't know
[2:09:04] me
[2:09:06] they're just happy to see a miracle ah
[2:09:09] God is there God is there
[2:09:11] God said I'm tired of it I'm tired of it
[2:09:13] I'm just tired of it
[2:09:15] but Moses he knows me in my ways
[2:09:19] to him I can talk like a friend
[2:09:23] oh I can talk to him like somebody that
[2:09:25] has grown up
[2:09:28] to him I can say Moses you did a mistake
[2:09:31] to him I can say Moses I'm sorry you
[2:09:34] don't go in the land
[2:09:38] is that right
[2:09:39] and Moses didn't melt
[2:09:44] is that right he didn't melt down and
[2:09:46] said oh no he had to accept
[2:09:49] David a man after God's Own Heart
[2:09:52] you know why he was after God's Own
[2:09:54] Heart
[2:09:56] he was a man not because of his mistakes
[2:09:58] but because what he did after the
[2:10:01] mistakes
[2:10:06] he could repent like no one could repent
[2:10:09] but then after repentance was over
[2:10:12] he stood up
[2:10:13] and he said time of repentance is over
[2:10:15] now
[2:10:16] time of being child and uh weeping and
[2:10:19] it's over now
[2:10:21] is that right that's why he was a man
[2:10:23] after God's Own Heart because he always
[2:10:26] could come up and God could talk to him
[2:10:28] again
[2:10:30] but here was here was about here it was
[2:10:33] about job and and you know how God was
[2:10:37] getting the attraction on him
[2:10:39] that have you seen my servant
[2:10:42] there's no one like him
[2:10:46] ah the Satan said yeah it's very easy
[2:10:47] you have kept him you have blessed him
[2:10:49] you know God said okay go ahead
[2:10:53] take it away from him
[2:10:55] he's good so Satan took everything away
[2:10:57] you know how it was okay you know
[2:10:59] everything went off of him
[2:11:02] and then finally
[2:11:04] they met again God and said they met
[2:11:06] again and so God and Satan said again
[2:11:08] hey
[2:11:09] if you considered him
[2:11:13] there's no one like him
[2:11:15] you know there's no one like him
[2:11:18] yeah he said okay you know A man gives
[2:11:20] you know of everything let me give but
[2:11:22] then God said you can do everything
[2:11:24] but his life you don't touch
[2:11:30] Hallelujah
[2:11:31] his life you don't touch
[2:11:34] oh let's say let me say his life you
[2:11:37] cannot touch
[2:11:43] and then Satan must have said you know
[2:11:44] why why are you so sure
[2:11:46] about job
[2:11:49] and God has said I don't tell you this
[2:11:52] this I only tell him after a while
[2:11:56] and then after a while job understand
[2:11:59] even if the skin worms destroy this body
[2:12:04] yet in my flesh
[2:12:07] I will see him
[2:12:09] you know I will see him because I'm a
[2:12:11] part of him
[2:12:12] this Revelation came to job
[2:12:15] and this came to job and God had his own
[2:12:18] way to prove him
[2:12:20] do you know that brother Branham
[2:12:22] actually said
[2:12:24] not one disaster job went through
[2:12:27] was for chastisement
[2:12:30] not one
[2:12:32] all of them was for proving
[2:12:38] Hallelujah
[2:12:40] amen just to prove who he was
[2:12:43] and God in this hour came down to proof
[2:12:46] now who his pride is
[2:12:48] and he has his only his own way of
[2:12:52] proving her
[2:12:55] don't judge your life how much power you
[2:12:58] have to perform miracles
[2:13:03] Hallelujah
[2:13:05] what a great time we're living in church
[2:13:08] amen what a great time you're living in
[2:13:10] but here the woman let me let me finish
[2:13:11] at least the woman at the well okay then
[2:13:13] we can maybe come tomorrow we go a
[2:13:16] little bit deeper we will see how the
[2:13:18] Lord really allows because we want to go
[2:13:19] back to Eve finally
[2:13:22] we want to see really where where Eve
[2:13:24] was going what Eve was what he wasn't
[2:13:28] you know that
[2:13:30] when he came to Eve
[2:13:34] she was in her Ephesians
[2:13:38] yes she was placed
[2:13:44] she was placed
[2:13:47] because Adam had told her you are bone
[2:13:50] of my bone you are Flesh of My Flesh you
[2:13:54] are me another form she was positionally
[2:13:57] placed
[2:14:01] amen
[2:14:03] and in her if he
[2:14:07] if Satan came to her
[2:14:10] knowing
[2:14:13] knowing
[2:14:15] what ability lays in her
[2:14:19] that's why Satan comes to you
[2:14:21] he knows what church you go to yeah he
[2:14:24] knows what you hear in this church
[2:14:27] that's why he's attracted to you
[2:14:30] because potentially he knows you have
[2:14:32] bright material
[2:14:38] amen so you understand so that's why he
[2:14:41] came to her
[2:14:42] that's why you you are under full attack
[2:14:44] of him
[2:14:46] because he knows what kind of abilities
[2:14:48] you have
[2:14:49] maybe you don't know yourself Eve didn't
[2:14:52] know herself
[2:14:53] because she was not identifying herself
[2:14:56] it was Adam identifying her
[2:14:59] so this is not what you say about this
[2:15:02] is what the word says about you
[2:15:05] this is not what you can say about it
[2:15:07] it's not to say I'm bright I'm bright
[2:15:08] I'm bright
[2:15:11] but when he said that
[2:15:14] we should believe it
[2:15:17] is that right if he said that amen we
[2:15:20] should believe it
[2:15:23] what kind of potential it's Leonard
[2:15:26] foreign
[2:15:32] because really I'm
[2:15:34] I don't want to
[2:15:36] I don't want to mess up the first
[2:15:37] evening already
[2:15:40] I have in Europe the having Europe the
[2:15:42] uh and not a good reputation I've always
[2:15:45] been so long
[2:15:46] so I I said to Lord I I don't want to
[2:15:49] mess up my reputation just in the first
[2:15:50] meeting
[2:15:55] but you understand he was Eve he was the
[2:15:57] woman
[2:15:59] what kind of potential lay in her
[2:16:05] this kind of potentials lays in you
[2:16:12] can we believe that it's not my words
[2:16:15] it's not my words
[2:16:17] but I'm just telling you what the
[2:16:19] prophet said
[2:16:24] amen so who are you
[2:16:27] are you Miss Jesus Christ
[2:16:30] is this Who You Are
[2:16:33] you married to him
[2:16:35] who is married to him this evening
[2:16:38] not to William Branham not to your
[2:16:40] pastor not to this church to Jesus
[2:16:42] Christ
[2:16:44] and if you're married to Jesus Christ
[2:16:46] who are you
[2:16:52] yes
[2:16:54] amen
[2:16:55] because he came down to marry his womb
[2:16:59] in this day not William Branham came
[2:17:01] down
[2:17:02] Jesus Christ came down Revelation 10 1
[2:17:06] was not William Branham Revelation 10 1
[2:17:08] was Jesus Christ
[2:17:11] he came down
[2:17:13] this was seven angel stand for
[2:17:17] is that right
[2:17:19] that's why Seven Ages stand for for he
[2:17:21] himself coming down because you see the
[2:17:24] seven angels forming a cloud who is that
[2:17:26] Jesus Christ
[2:17:28] and Jesus Christ came down he said right
[2:17:32] Jesus Christ came down Revelation 10 1
[2:17:35] came down
[2:17:38] in that time Revelation 10 7 was on
[2:17:42] Earth
[2:17:45] said that at the time of that coming the
[2:17:48] seventh angel Messenger will be on earth
[2:17:52] sir so is he just coming for to him
[2:17:56] you know he's coming to him for a reason
[2:18:02] Revelation 10 a marriage take place
[2:18:09] you can read it in the in the message
[2:18:10] the breach it's very amazing you read
[2:18:13] the message you preach Anew it's it's
[2:18:15] amazing page 88 in the English if I have
[2:18:18] it right in the book
[2:18:20] brother Adam is speaking of the Angels
[2:18:21] coming down
[2:18:23] Christ coming down
[2:18:25] and then brother banham said this
[2:18:28] he said oh
[2:18:31] he said am I
[2:18:33] feeling like this
[2:18:35] just feeling like this
[2:18:37] you know what you do in a marriage
[2:18:41] you ask the question
[2:18:43] is there anyone here
[2:18:45] that has something to say against it
[2:18:49] this is what brother Venom is doing in
[2:18:50] that sermon
[2:18:52] and then brother said if not then
[2:18:55] forever hold your peace
[2:18:58] read the reach message he's doing it
[2:19:00] exactly in the sermon
[2:19:03] just performing a marriage
[2:19:09] the question is what do you say about it
[2:19:15] he said already yes
[2:19:20] he came down and he said already yes
[2:19:26] that's my life
[2:19:30] what do you say about it
[2:19:32] what is your answer
[2:19:35] he asked you will you marry me that
[2:19:37] coming down he came for one reason
[2:19:42] yes not just to play games
[2:19:45] just to marry his bride
[2:19:47] the prophet said the marriage takes
[2:19:49] place on Earth
[2:19:51] then we go to the marriage supper
[2:19:56] is that correct
[2:19:57] this is what we have seen in our day
[2:20:00] Christ coming down Revelation 10 one
[2:20:03] came to Revelation Revelation 10 7.
[2:20:08] to get married to Revelation 10 8 to 11.
[2:20:14] oh my and this is changing for the
[2:20:17] bright Church
[2:20:18] it was changing for John
[2:20:21] you know why it was the same John that
[2:20:24] before
[2:20:26] was not even Worthy
[2:20:29] to look at the book
[2:20:31] not even Worthy
[2:20:33] is that right no one was worthy go to
[2:20:36] Revelation 4 and 5. no one that's why he
[2:20:39] wept
[2:20:40] no one was worthy to take the book
[2:20:43] but something very amazing happened in
[2:20:45] Revelation 10.
[2:20:47] he is asked
[2:20:49] or he's commanded
[2:20:53] take the book
[2:20:55] eat the book
[2:20:57] become pregnant with the book
[2:21:00] because you are the book
[2:21:02] become pregnant with the book because
[2:21:04] now you will bring forth Thou shalt
[2:21:08] prophesy again
[2:21:11] and church allow me to say
[2:21:14] this is what's going on right now
[2:21:18] the bride is prophesying again
[2:21:21] [Applause]
[2:21:23] God's final voice
[2:21:32] wonderful you clap not to me because
[2:21:35] this is what he said hey
[2:21:37] Hallelujah you could clap to a minister
[2:21:40] because he's saying what the prophet
[2:21:41] said
[2:21:42] he's saying what the word said many
[2:21:43] times people clear because of emotions
[2:21:47] that's wonderful okay that's not too bad
[2:21:49] but better is when you really clap
[2:21:52] because of the word
[2:21:54] [Applause]
[2:21:58] Hallelujah
[2:22:00] amen isn't it isn't it amazing come on
[2:22:02] Church
[2:22:04] the one that was crying and weeping and
[2:22:07] one came and said John weep not
[2:22:10] we've not
[2:22:11] because the line of the tribe of Judah
[2:22:14] has prevailed
[2:22:15] and when he turned around what did he
[2:22:17] saw he saw a lamb
[2:22:20] as it was saying Jesus Christ
[2:22:23] he paid the price Church
[2:22:26] he paid the price
[2:22:30] Hallelujah paid the price for full
[2:22:32] Redemption and now now we can imagine
[2:22:34] John who was just he said no one was
[2:22:36] worthy so he must have seen there was
[2:22:38] not even allowed not even to look at the
[2:22:41] book
[2:22:43] not to touch it not to look at it not
[2:22:47] even to look at it it's amazing isn't it
[2:22:49] oh God help us
[2:22:54] and now the angel tells him
[2:22:58] go to the angel
[2:23:00] take the book
[2:23:03] John said me
[2:23:09] in Revelations 4
[2:23:12] I was not worthy to look at it
[2:23:16] and I can remember how I cried
[2:23:22] and I know
[2:23:24] that one of the
[2:23:26] one came to me and said to me don't cry
[2:23:28] John don't weep
[2:23:30] Hallelujah
[2:23:32] Hallelujah don't weep John
[2:23:34] because
[2:23:36] the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[2:23:38] prevailed
[2:23:39] the price is paid
[2:23:46] and what it's change what is the change
[2:23:49] now
[2:23:53] John
[2:23:55] is him now
[2:23:57] because you know what happens at the
[2:23:58] marriage or we could go we could go for
[2:24:00] a long there's a big
[2:24:03] the Bible speaks of Enoch
[2:24:06] Bobby speaks of Enoch you know Enoch the
[2:24:08] seventh from Adam
[2:24:09] a type of this church is that right
[2:24:12] is that right
[2:24:13] Enoch and not much is written about
[2:24:15] Enoch so we don't know what he really
[2:24:18] did or what he has all done and we don't
[2:24:21] so a good thing is we cannot copy
[2:24:25] so it's not much written how much he
[2:24:27] prayed and you know what he did to
[2:24:29] please God but he had the testimony
[2:24:31] before his translation that he pleased
[2:24:33] lot and without faith it is impossible
[2:24:36] to please God you must believe what he
[2:24:39] said about you
[2:24:40] [Music]
[2:24:42] sure
[2:24:43] and the seventh from Adam
[2:24:46] is that right the seventh from Adam
[2:24:48] Enoch before his translation church he
[2:24:51] had that testimony
[2:24:52] that he pleased God and this church will
[2:24:56] have before their translation they will
[2:24:59] have the same testimony
[2:25:01] that day please and you know what
[2:25:04] pleasing God means adoption
[2:25:10] yes what about Israel
[2:25:13] most of them God was not well pleased
[2:25:18] you know why he never could bring them
[2:25:20] to adoption they always stayed like
[2:25:22] little children they saw a miracle
[2:25:25] praise God the Miracles over oh God
[2:25:32] yeah come on this is what they were and
[2:25:33] after 40 years God get tired
[2:25:39] and after 60 years
[2:25:42] amen after 60 years now
[2:25:45] Hallelujah after 60 years he's now on
[2:25:47] the scene
[2:25:49] he came down Church
[2:25:52] and now he wants to have a bride
[2:25:57] if you marry if as my wife married me I
[2:26:02] remember and I remember it's too long
[2:26:03] ago but I I think in the wedding night
[2:26:06] remember in the wedding night
[2:26:08] you know you married your wife and also
[2:26:11] in future what do you do with your wife
[2:26:13] always your husband who is your wife if
[2:26:16] she only you come into the house and you
[2:26:19] want to be received as the husband or
[2:26:21] you know as the one that loves you and
[2:26:24] and she's just sitting in the corner
[2:26:27] enjoying the gift that you gave her
[2:26:30] just enjoying the gift you know my what
[2:26:34] a wonderful gift my husband has given me
[2:26:37] and you know he can maybe stand it for a
[2:26:39] couple of days
[2:26:41] but when it comes to reproduction
[2:26:44] when it comes to giving life
[2:26:46] it's not enough to play with gifts that
[2:26:48] you have from him
[2:26:50] but when it comes to life you need him
[2:26:53] you need Revelation 10 1 in this hour
[2:26:57] to bring forth the same kind of life
[2:26:59] don't play with gifts
[2:27:03] The Giver of gifts is here
[2:27:10] Hallelujah
[2:27:12] amen why are we close why are we close
[2:27:14] we have to come to a close
[2:27:17] amen
[2:27:19] but this is what Eve was
[2:27:22] the woman
[2:27:30] let me read to you one statement
[2:27:32] of the prophet
[2:27:34] oh no I keep it till tomorrow
[2:27:40] it's too wonderful to see what God is
[2:27:42] doing
[2:27:45] Hallelujah that will go into the subject
[2:27:47] of Tomorrow of what true worship is
[2:27:51] what true worship is
[2:27:54] God was Jesus was sitting with a woman
[2:27:56] at the well
[2:27:58] and he was telling her
[2:28:00] the father
[2:28:01] seeks worship
[2:28:05] is that right
[2:28:07] God is looking for worship
[2:28:10] not just for singer
[2:28:13] not just for musicians which is
[2:28:15] wonderful don't misunderstand me wrong
[2:28:18] but worship to God is different
[2:28:21] that worship Him in spirit and in truth
[2:28:24] he was telling that woman
[2:28:26] in that condition you cannot worship
[2:28:29] but when he I I you know when he
[2:28:32] inventoried her then she could worship
[2:28:37] is that right
[2:28:38] then she could worship
[2:28:40] you know what she did she ran into the
[2:28:43] city
[2:28:45] she brought people to Christ
[2:28:48] it was now Christ working through her
[2:28:53] and she said when the Messiah cometh
[2:28:56] he will do those things he just had to
[2:28:58] say
[2:28:59] honey
[2:29:01] it's me
[2:29:04] and she understood oh that's him
[2:29:08] then I am his bride
[2:29:10] and she ran into the city
[2:29:13] Hallelujah you see what changes your
[2:29:16] life
[2:29:17] if you know who he is
[2:29:19] then you know who you are
[2:29:22] if you can identify him you will
[2:29:24] identify yourself
[2:29:27] last quote
[2:29:30] of
[2:29:32] of God's provided place of worship
[2:29:35] listen very careful
[2:29:37] the result of no leaven among you
[2:29:42] no leaven among you
[2:29:44] that brings the entire fullness
[2:29:48] of the godhead bodily among you
[2:29:54] if there's no leaven
[2:29:56] no leaven
[2:29:58] no leaven of the Pharisees
[2:30:01] be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees
[2:30:03] Jesus was warning
[2:30:07] you know what 11 is
[2:30:09] foreign
[2:30:11] the message of the former age
[2:30:16] is that okay can I say that
[2:30:19] yeah I'm just telling you what the
[2:30:20] prophet said
[2:30:23] he said if there's no leaven among you
[2:30:26] just pure word of this day
[2:30:33] listen what it brings
[2:30:34] it brings the entire fullness of the
[2:30:37] godhead bodily among you
[2:30:40] can you believe that the entire fullness
[2:30:43] of the godhead now bodily
[2:30:47] bodily hello who is that
[2:30:50] you are
[2:30:52] the entire fullness
[2:30:54] of the godhead because all that God was
[2:30:58] he poured into
[2:31:01] and we had a prophet telling us and all
[2:31:03] that Christ was is now
[2:31:06] so that all that God was is now in the
[2:31:08] church
[2:31:10] and no leaven amongst us brings the
[2:31:12] entire fullness
[2:31:15] couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't
[2:31:17] do it in versus age couldn't do it in
[2:31:19] the Pentecostal age but in the day when
[2:31:22] the son of man has been manifested
[2:31:24] brought the church back together with
[2:31:26] the entire deity of God amongst his
[2:31:29] people
[2:31:32] isn't it wonderful
[2:31:34] Hallelujah that's why it's good to have
[2:31:37] inventory
[2:31:39] God bless you let us down to our feet
[2:31:46] yes just tell them that you love him
[2:31:50] what he has done for us in this what he
[2:31:52] has done for us in this day
[2:31:54] hallelujah what he has done for us
[2:31:56] Church
[2:31:57] he came down himself
[2:31:59] Hallelujah and he is here
[2:32:03] do you believe that this evening
[2:32:06] brother random left the scene but he
[2:32:10] didn't lift he didn't lift he stayed
[2:32:13] because he came for his bride
[2:32:17] not just to find her not just to find
[2:32:19] her you know and not just to play with
[2:32:21] her no to make herself ready
[2:32:24] amen and the bride has made it now he
[2:32:27] gave her the fine linen
[2:32:30] which is his righteousness
[2:32:33] is that right that's why John could be
[2:32:36] told eat the book John
[2:32:42] because he was there closed in his
[2:32:45] righteousness
[2:32:51] let us pray Heavenly Father
[2:32:53] we thank you for your grace and mercy
[2:32:55] father we thank you for what you have
[2:32:57] done
[2:33:01] it sounds
[2:33:03] sometimes
[2:33:04] too good to be truth
[2:33:09] but I'm so glad that it was your Prophet
[2:33:11] telling us this these things
[2:33:16] it's not an idol Idol Tale

[2:34:14] [Music]
[2:34:16] Mary was blinded

[2:34:20] she still had their former understanding
[2:34:23] with her

[2:34:56] from
[2:34:57] the old teaching

[2:35:03] and you told him since that angel came
[2:35:05] down

[2:36:17] things that block us that occupy us
[2:36:21] so that we can receive
[2:36:24] this word in its pure and entire form we
[2:36:30] pray oh God
[2:36:34] Hallelujah like the woman at the well
[2:36:37] like so many
[2:36:39] like Paul

[2:36:44] you have met Paul there on the road to
[2:36:46] Damascus
[2:36:49] he was so full of everything
[2:36:53] then you let him down to Arabia to get
[2:36:56] free completely
[2:36:59] and then you could bring him up
[2:37:01] there where he saw his theophany
[2:37:07] father we pray
[2:37:09] that each and one each and everyone here
[2:37:11] this evening
[2:37:13] can get so delivered so free from
[2:37:16] everything
[2:37:18] that you can bring us to ourselves
[2:37:21] like the prodigal

[2:37:25] there was a time when he could come to
[2:37:27] himself
[2:37:29] [Music]
[2:37:30] when he could not even get swine food
[2:37:32] anymore
[2:37:33] [Music]
