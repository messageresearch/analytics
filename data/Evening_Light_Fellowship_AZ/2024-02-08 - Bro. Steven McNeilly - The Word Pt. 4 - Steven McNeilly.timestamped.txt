[30:16] yeah welcome home praise the Lord
[30:18] Revelation chap
[30:20] 20 and verse
[30:25] 11 and it says and I saw a great white
[30:28] throne and him that sat on it from whose
[30:31] face the earth and the heaven fled away
[30:35] and there was found no place for them
[30:38] and I saw the dead small and great stand
[30:41] before God and the books were opened and
[30:44] another book was opened which is The
[30:46] Book of Life and the dead were judged
[30:49] out of those things which were written
[30:51] in the books according to their works
[30:54] somebody say books books there's two
[30:57] different books that we're seeing here
[30:59] amen there's the books and then there's
[31:01] another book it's very
[31:04] important for us to know what these
[31:06] books are and what are contained within
[31:09] these books and the Sea gave up the dead
[31:12] which were in it and death and Hell
[31:14] delivered up the dead which were in them
[31:17] and they were judged every man according
[31:19] to their works and death and hell were
[31:22] cast into the Lake of Fire this is the
[31:26] second death and everybody said amen
[31:29] praise the Lord and whosoever was not
[31:32] found written in the Book of Life was
[31:35] cast into the Lake of Fire amen John 1
[31:51] ver14 John 1 and verse1 14 and it says
[31:54] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[31:56] Among Us
[31:58] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[32:00] the only begotten of the father full of
[32:03] grace and truth amen may the Lord add
[32:07] the blessing to the reading of his word
[32:09] you may be
[32:11] seated I would like to continue on this
[32:14] evening with this thought uh and I'd
[32:17] like to title it the word and this is
[32:20] part four and we've been speaking on the
[32:24] word of God and how that the the word
[32:27] became flesh and dwelt among us and we
[32:31] realized that there was a reason for the
[32:34] word to become flesh and it was not only
[32:39] for God to redeem man and to bring him
[32:42] back into his original position and
[32:45] having fellowship with God just like man
[32:49] had in the Garden of Eden yet that is a
[32:52] part of it but another part of the
[32:55] reason why he be became flesh was that
[32:59] we the flesh might become the word which
[33:03] is Christ so the word became flesh was
[33:08] materialized amongst us so that the
[33:11] flesh now might become the word it's
[33:14] just like that song that we sing uh he
[33:17] became me so that I might become him by
[33:22] grace and so we all are of a great
[33:25] understanding that if it wasn't for the
[33:27] grace of almighty God there's absolutely
[33:30] no way that we could make it there's no
[33:32] way that we could become the word
[33:34] there's no way for us to get to heaven
[33:36] but by Grace amen that's what I'm
[33:39] depending upon this evening is the grace
[33:41] of God
[33:44] Amen and so we see then that this great
[33:49] Plan of Redemption that God has had in
[33:52] his mind since the foundations of the
[33:54] world has been unfolding and unfolding
[33:58] for for times and times we see since the
[34:01] Fall In the Garden of Eden and God is
[34:04] wanting to restore us back to what we
[34:07] originally had with him with Fellowship
[34:10] one with another because that's the
[34:13] great Chasm that came between God and
[34:16] man When sin entered the picture the
[34:18] fellowship was never the same as it was
[34:21] before there was a Chasm there was a a a
[34:24] a a canyon there was there was a hole in
[34:27] the ground there was something that was
[34:29] there that was preventing the fellowship
[34:31] that God desires to have with man amen
[34:35] and so we know that Jesus Christ came
[34:37] and he came to redeem those that were
[34:40] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[34:42] he became he he came to redeem those
[34:46] that were a part of him from the
[34:48] beginning he didn't come to redeem the
[34:51] whole earth he didn't come to redeem all
[34:54] those of mankind but only those who were
[34:58] predestinated to receive it prise the
[35:00] Lord that's why brother bradam said if
[35:03] you were never in his mind in the
[35:05] beginning you will never be there in the
[35:08] end but if you were in his mind in the
[35:11] beginning there's nothing that can
[35:14] prevent us there's nothing that can stop
[35:16] us or hindering us from entering into
[35:20] the joys of the Lord
[35:23] hallelujah now because mankind fail the
[35:27] Flesh in order for man to be redeemed
[35:31] from his
[35:33] flesh understand you don't have to be
[35:35] delivered from your wife you don't have
[35:39] to be delivered from your husband or
[35:41] your kids or the neighbors or even the
[35:43] neighbor's dog you've got to be
[35:45] delivered from your own flesh because
[35:49] your own flesh man is the one who gives
[35:51] you the most trouble on a daily
[35:54] basis good the biggest problem that we
[35:58] have in our homes is our flesh
[36:02] man our home is made for a a a
[36:07] sanctuary our home is supposed to be a a
[36:10] Haven a safe place a a place where we
[36:13] can get away from the things of the
[36:15] world and and and have our little family
[36:18] uh in a Sanctified safe Zone but too
[36:21] much of the time we get carnal too much
[36:24] of the time we get caught up in our
[36:27] flesh in the place where we're supposed
[36:29] to be a a sanctuary and a
[36:33] Haven all of a sudden we're walking in
[36:36] flesh and because of our flesh man
[36:39] there's troubles in the
[36:41] home there's troubles in marriages
[36:44] there's troubles with the kids why
[36:46] because we're in the flesh God help us
[36:50] to take inventory of Our Lives father
[36:53] let me realize and recognize when I'm In
[36:57] the Flesh because I know when I'm in the
[36:59] flesh there's trouble ahead let me be in
[37:03] the spirit not just when I'm in church
[37:05] not just on a Wednesday or Sunday but 24
[37:09] hours in a day seven days a week father
[37:12] let me be in the
[37:15] spirit in order for you to be in the
[37:18] spirit though you've got to do something
[37:21] you've got to yield yourself to the
[37:24] presence of God cuz if you don't yield
[37:27] yourself to God God can't work in our
[37:33] lives God help us praise God so we
[37:36] realize that God took upon himself a
[37:39] robe of
[37:40] Flesh to redeem us from this Fallen
[37:43] State y that we find ourselves born in
[37:46] amen if I would have had the choice I
[37:50] would have said father I don't want to
[37:52] be born in a fallen State let me be born
[37:56] in a perfect State and I'll live
[37:58] perfectly for you but God had another
[38:04] plan so we realize that all of our sins
[38:08] our failures our shortcomings the things
[38:10] that hinder us now the things that
[38:13] prevent us from entering into the
[38:15] presence of God has already been taken
[38:17] care of at the cross of Calvary by Jesus
[38:20] Christ Our Lord thank you Lord thank you
[38:23] Lord all of your shortcomings all of
[38:25] your failures yeah all of your faults
[38:27] guess what it's already taken care of
[38:31] God has already taken care of it and
[38:33] he's already made away Amen Hallelujah
[38:37] Jesus so because man fail in the flesh
[38:40] God had to come and redeem Man In the
[38:44] Flesh God could not redeem mankind as a
[38:48] spirit because a spirit is not kin's
[38:51] folk a spirit is not uh uh close to uh
[38:56] the human flesh the spirit of man did
[39:00] not
[39:01] fall it was the flesh man so in order
[39:04] now for God to to operate and become a
[39:09] kinsman redeemer he had to become
[39:13] flesh what does it mean to be kins
[39:17] folk what does it mean to be a kinsman
[39:19] redeemer it means to be close in
[39:22] relation it means to be blood relation
[39:25] oh that's my kin FK if you were to see
[39:28] some of my cousins in Ireland you would
[39:30] say that's brother Steven's kin folk
[39:33] well how would you know because they
[39:35] kind of look like me we have the same
[39:37] kind of attributes we have the same kind
[39:39] of characteristics whether we like to
[39:43] believe it and accept it or
[39:48] not I don't look like him yeah you
[39:51] do my uncle ah I have an uncle and and
[39:56] uh and and he's short and he's kind of
[39:59] heavy way shorter than me and way
[40:01] heavier than me and uh they call him fat
[40:06] Eddie
[40:08] right I'm like
[40:10] him my uncle Denver man you look at the
[40:14] two of us you think he's my dad and I
[40:16] look at him and I say no way Lord when I
[40:19] look in the mirror I'm look completely
[40:21] different but we have the same nose we
[40:23] have the same facial features I think my
[40:27] goodness why cuz we're kin folk we're of
[40:30] the same blood it's like my boys I went
[40:33] and did my taxes the other day and I was
[40:35] it's kind of funny the last you know six
[40:38] plus years whatever it is that I've been
[40:39] doing my taxes at this place I've always
[40:42] had a kid the next year
[40:45] almost
[40:47] so he told me no more kids no no more
[40:52] kids so I showed him a picture of my
[40:55] family you know how how was proud dads
[40:57] like to do with their kids and uh he
[40:59] looks at that and he goes oh yeah
[41:01] there's no denying those boys are
[41:05] yours why because we're kin folk we're
[41:09] blood related and so God now had to
[41:12] become Kinsmen he had to become flesh so
[41:15] that he be so that he could redeem us in
[41:19] the flesh praise the Lord now we realize
[41:22] that the Book of Ruth was a shadow of
[41:25] the complete Plan of Redemption of God
[41:30] how that God would become kin folk to us
[41:33] how that uh how that he hungered
[41:36] sometimes other times he cried he knew
[41:40] what it was like to to to to be tempted
[41:43] in the wilderness for 40 days he knew
[41:47] what it was like to to cry at the grave
[41:49] of Lazareth he knew what it was like to
[41:52] suffer as a human being he knew what it
[41:55] was like to have good friends in his
[41:57] life but he also knew what it was like
[42:00] to have those friends betray him in the
[42:03] darkest hour of his life he suffered
[42:07] within the gate he suffered In the Flesh
[42:10] why because he wanted to be a good high
[42:13] priest that could be touched by the
[42:15] feelings of our
[42:18] infirmities I want you to know that God
[42:22] understands where you're at in your life
[42:24] why because he's B
[42:26] there he's suffered through those things
[42:29] he's had the same thoughts but if he
[42:32] overcame those things we can also
[42:34] overcome them as
[42:38] well he went through all these things he
[42:41] was tempted in every manner yet as the
[42:44] scripture says he was without
[42:47] sin now we realize that when Boaz paid
[42:52] the price for Naomi's plot of land when
[42:56] he redeemed
[42:58] Naomi he got Ruth true amen he played
[43:03] the part of a kinsman redeemer there was
[43:06] another man that was closer kin to Naomi
[43:10] than Boaz was and so he had a meeting
[43:13] with him and he said hey are you willing
[43:15] to make uh are you willing to to to do
[43:18] this and to redeem Naomi and Ruth and he
[43:21] said I am able to do it but I'm not
[43:24] going to do it who was the our nearest
[43:26] to Kin before we came to Christ it's our
[43:29] carnal man it was Satan through our
[43:32] natural birth but Satan can't redeem us
[43:35] from nothing he just gets us into
[43:37] trouble but here was Boaz he says he
[43:40] says if you're not willing to do it I am
[43:43] able and I am willing to do this perform
[43:47] this work of redemption because I am
[43:50] kins folk to Naomi and he takes off his
[43:53] shoe Footprints are possession and he
[43:56] slams his shoe and he says I'm going to
[43:59] pay the price for Naomi but Ruth
[44:02] Hallelujah will be my bride so when
[44:06] Jesus Christ came his he came to his own
[44:09] and his own received him not he said I
[44:12] am come but to the lost sheep of
[44:16] Israel that's right he redeemed Israel
[44:19] right but he got himself a gentile
[44:23] bride what is it it's a perfect type
[44:26] showing us that the price has been
[44:32] paid that ought to make us happy tonight
[44:35] to know that the price has been paid in
[44:38] full that we have the earnest of our
[44:40] inheritance already within us
[44:44] hallelujah Ruth 4: 9 and 10 look at this
[44:48] and Bo said unto the elders unto all the
[44:50] people you're Witnesses this day that I
[44:53] have bought all that was aimex and all
[44:56] that was Chileans and malons of the hand
[44:59] of Naomi moreover Ruth the Moes the wife
[45:02] of Malon have I purchased to be my wife
[45:06] what did Christ purchase you with yes he
[45:09] did wasn't just something that was free
[45:12] he didn't just take you for nothing no
[45:14] he paid the ultimate price for without
[45:17] the shedding of blood there is no
[45:19] remission of sins so he paid the
[45:21] ultimate price my friend for you and I
[45:26] Lord thank
[45:29] God to raise up the name of the Dead
[45:32] upon his inheritance that the name of
[45:34] the Dead be not cut off from among his
[45:36] Brethren and from the Gate of his place
[45:39] ye are witnesses today so when Jesus
[45:43] Paid the ultimate price his own blood it
[45:47] it it it it it bought us those who were
[45:51] predestinated to
[45:54] life so what does he get out of
[45:59] it a lot of times we talk about our
[46:02] inheritance and oh my if we would only
[46:05] know our inheritance and we would put
[46:07] our name on The Inheritance and The
[46:08] Inheritance is ours what does Jesus get
[46:11] out of this fellow what does he get in
[46:14] return for the price that he
[46:17] paid I come across this quote today and
[46:20] it was just beautiful brother brandham
[46:22] said she is his
[46:26] inheritance that's right
[46:29] Hallelujah where does that put you and I
[46:32] yes sir who say we are a part of this
[46:36] inheritance who say that we believe the
[46:38] message and that we're the Bride of this
[46:40] last day guess what you ought to start
[46:42] looking at yourself a little more
[46:45] differently and start looking at
[46:46] yourself how he sees you if we see the
[46:50] inheritance of Heaven that it's so great
[46:53] and it's So Glorious and The Inheritance
[46:55] that written within this book and it
[46:57] makes us feel so overwhelmed and joyful
[47:00] how does it make God feel when he looks
[47:03] at you when he sees that the glory of
[47:06] the man is the
[47:09] woman if God could have gave him
[47:12] anything greater he would have done it
[47:14] that's right but he give him you and I
[47:16] oh what an inheritance and this is an
[47:19] inheritance that he is excited
[47:23] about Hallelujah
[47:26] he can't wait to come and take you
[47:28] home he can't wait for that hour when
[47:32] the clouds will part he can't wait for
[47:34] that hour of the rapturing of his bride
[47:37] why because as long as you've been
[47:39] waiting he's been waiting
[47:41] longer he is waiting for you to come
[47:44] into your position in Christ he is
[47:46] waiting for you to catch the vision to
[47:49] catch the understanding of the word
[47:51] that's what he's waiting for I say
[47:54] father wait no longer give it to me give
[47:57] me the Revelation Lord to get us out of
[48:00] here yes Lord because once the true
[48:03] church realizes who she
[48:05] [Applause]
[48:07] is and why she's here she'll be an
[48:11] invincible
[48:13] Army
[48:15] Hallelujah she'll be an army not an army
[48:18] that that can't be
[48:21] seen she'll be an army that stands
[48:24] temptation she'll be an army that
[48:26] overcomes Temptation she'll be an
[48:29] overcomer in this day While others are
[48:31] undergoing why because she cannot be
[48:35] conquered
[48:37] Hallelujah she is his inheritance to
[48:40] breach between the seven Church ages and
[48:42] the Seven Seals he said notice here he
[48:44] come leaves the throne as an intercessor
[48:48] as a slain lamb to become a lion king to
[48:51] bring the whole world into judgment
[48:54] that's rejected what have they rejected
[48:57] they've rejected the word for their day
[48:59] you see the importance of recognizing
[49:03] your word and its message for the day
[49:05] and hour in which you live
[49:10] amen our kinsman redeemer then is King
[49:13] overall why he's got the title deed of
[49:15] Redemption where does he have it he has
[49:18] it in that little
[49:21] book who is that title deed of
[49:24] redemption who is it that's written
[49:26] within that
[49:28] book Brother Paul's the only one raising
[49:30] his
[49:31] hand I'm going to raise my hand because
[49:35] I'm foolish enough to believe that I am
[49:37] a part of it I am foolish enough to
[49:40] believe that my name is written within
[49:42] that book why because God has begin
[49:45] something in my life that I have no
[49:48] control
[49:49] over once I lived a life of sin that I
[49:52] had no control over but when Jesus came
[49:55] in
[49:56] Hallelujah something has been happening
[49:59] I've been transformed by the renewing of
[50:01] my mind not by trying to do it myself
[50:05] but letting God do
[50:06] it don't try to do it yourself you're
[50:09] going to fail let God do it let God do
[50:12] the work don't try to overcome well I'm
[50:14] going to try no let God do
[50:16] [Applause]
[50:18] iten the moment that we try to bring our
[50:21] Humanity into it we're going to fail
[50:23] every single time but if would just take
[50:26] a backseat and let pilate Jesus take a
[50:30] hold of our ship and say father I'm done
[50:33] trying to steer this thing I'm done
[50:35] trying to get this thing out of the
[50:36] rocks and everything Lord take
[50:41] control thank you Lord it all Lays in
[50:45] his hand he says I'm glad I know him
[50:50] see then claims his
[50:54] inheritance that that's the church the
[50:57] bride he claims it amen he comes to
[51:03] claim those who are
[51:06] his those who are written in the palm of
[51:09] his hand what does he come for he comes
[51:12] to claim them why because he wants his
[51:15] inheritance he wants what belongs to him
[51:21] amen and when he comes he's going to
[51:23] take it right and there ain't nothing
[51:26] that's going to stop him from taking it
[51:29] not even your own self can stop him from
[51:31] taking
[51:33] it thank you
[51:37] Lord hallelujah Daniel chapter 7: 9 and
[51:42] 10 staying with this thought of the
[51:46] white Throne judgment and these books
[51:48] and what are these books mean and stuff
[51:51] verse 9 it says I beheld till the
[51:53] Thrones were cast down and the Ancient
[51:55] of Days did sit whose garment was white
[51:59] as snow and the hair of his head like
[52:01] the pure wool what did Brother brandham
[52:04] say it
[52:05] represents now it's changed it is the
[52:07] wig now he's he's the judge of all the
[52:11] Earth he's no longer a lamb but now he
[52:14] has his ministry has changed from a lion
[52:17] from a lamb now to a lion the the the
[52:21] ministry the dispensation of Grace is
[52:24] now over amen and it's no longer Grace
[52:27] but it's judgment with the white uh the
[52:30] white wool of the wig of judgment upon
[52:34] his head
[52:35] amen he is King judge that's right there
[52:40] ain't no president put him in it either
[52:42] there ain't no president that can take
[52:44] him out of being King judge why because
[52:46] it's
[52:47] [Applause]
[52:50] God you know we thought
[52:52] whenever whenever Trump put all these
[52:54] different judg judges in and stuff and
[52:56] and and and everything ah it's going to
[52:58] change everything that don't change
[53:02] Squad times are going to get worse and
[53:04] going to get worse it don't matter who
[53:06] we have in office it don't matter what
[53:08] kind of Judges that we have it's all a
[53:10] bunch of corruption why because Satan is
[53:12] the head of it all that's why I'm
[53:14] trusting in only one and one and only
[53:16] and that's
[53:17] God amen amen
[53:21] hallelujah amen it said his throne was
[53:23] like the fiery flame and his wheel as
[53:25] burning fire a fiery stream issued and
[53:29] uh and came forth from before him
[53:33] thousand thousands ministered onto
[53:37] him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before
[53:42] him the Judgment was set and the books
[53:46] were opened so there's thousands times
[53:51] thousands ministered onto him it's a
[53:53] group of people and 10,000 times 10,000
[53:58] stood before him notice one is
[54:01] ministering and one is standing before
[54:04] him it's two groups of people amen we
[54:08] pick it back up again Revelation 20 and
[54:10] verse 12 and I saw the dead small and
[54:13] great stand before God and the books
[54:16] were open and another book was opened
[54:19] which is The Book of Life and the dead
[54:22] were judged out of those things which
[54:24] were written in the book
[54:25] according to their
[54:28] works so now we see uh continuity
[54:33] between these scriptures though one was
[54:36] written by Daniel in the Old Testament
[54:38] and the other one here by John the
[54:40] Revelator in the New Testament but this
[54:43] Vision or these scriptures are both uh
[54:46] portraying the same event it's not two
[54:50] different events but it's the same event
[54:53] that both men now are giving by
[54:56] inspiration and revelation of God of a
[54:59] future event that is to take place it is
[55:02] prophecy amen and so we see then that
[55:06] there's like I've already said there is
[55:09] the thousands times thousands that are
[55:12] ministering onto him there's the 10,000
[55:15] times 10 thousands of people that are
[55:17] standing before him and they're all
[55:20] doing something right they are all there
[55:24] for a purpose
[55:25] they're there for a reason and they are
[55:28] in their certain positions of where they
[55:31] are ministering and standing before God
[55:34] for a purpose
[55:38] amen we see
[55:40] that uh there was both groups that were
[55:43] there and that the books were
[55:47] opened now what is the significance in
[55:50] these
[55:51] books and what do they mean what are the
[55:55] significance of these groups of people
[55:59] and what does it mean who are these
[56:02] people where did these people come from
[56:06] what is the scene that is set before us
[56:10] what is happening in this I don't know
[56:12] about you but when I read it I can
[56:14] Envision it in my
[56:16] mind I can see something that's going on
[56:19] I see I see God sitting upon a throne
[56:22] and his white wig is on and and I see
[56:24] this fire and and thousands times
[56:27] thousands are are ministering on to him
[56:29] somehow but there's other people that
[56:31] are standing before him who are going to
[56:33] be judged by the
[56:36] books amen you see these books are very
[56:39] important because the Judgment comes
[56:42] from the books
[56:45] right I got quotes for you it's
[56:49] okay that's why I love amen the message
[56:52] of the hour amen it makes things so
[56:55] plain before us that a blind man that a
[56:59] foolish person that's unlearned such as
[57:02] myself can understand it why is it
[57:05] because it's the Holy Spirit that's
[57:08] given the interpretation it's the Holy
[57:10] Spirit that's given the revelation of
[57:13] what is
[57:14] written because you could read it and
[57:17] not understand it you can read what a
[57:19] prophet has said and still have no idea
[57:21] what he's talking about but the same
[57:24] Holy Ghost gave the inspiration to
[57:26] brother brandom if that's the same holy
[57:28] ghost in our lives we're going to catch
[57:31] it why because the word receives and
[57:34] recognizes the
[57:36] word hallelujah
[57:40] okay so we understand that in in Daniel
[57:44] chap 7 and in Revelation 20 it is both
[57:48] the picture of the same event what is
[57:50] this event that's taking
[57:52] place this event that is taking place it
[57:55] happens after the Rapture of the church
[57:58] it happens after the tribulation period
[58:01] after the Millennium Reign then the rest
[58:04] of the Dead will rise in the second
[58:06] resurrection and this event of the great
[58:09] white Throne judgment takes
[58:12] place after the
[58:14] Rapture after Millennium Reign not first
[58:17] resurrection second Resurrection I don't
[58:21] want to come up and second Resurrection
[58:24] amen because if I come up in second
[58:27] Resurrection guess what I've missed it
[58:30] and I'm going to be judged according to
[58:33] the
[58:35] book father let me take my judgment now
[58:40] that's why we're at church this evening
[58:42] because judgment begins at the house of
[58:45] God and so just for the simple fact that
[58:48] you're here this evening Hallelujah
[58:51] though it was hard to get here no no
[58:53] doubt you had some of you had a hard day
[58:55] some of you had a hard time with family
[58:57] this that no doubt some of you have many
[59:00] excuses not to come to church tonight
[59:03] but yet you're saying Father Judge Me am
[59:06] judge me because I'm going to church to
[59:08] be judged not to get a backrub not to be
[59:11] told how well I'm doing but to be judged
[59:14] Lord because if I take my judgment now I
[59:17] won't be judged over there the Lord
[59:20] questions and answers uh 1964 brother
[59:23] brandham says now notice in this second
[59:26] Resurrection when they come up then
[59:28] Satan's loosed out of his prison for a
[59:30] little season then the judgment is set
[59:33] now watch Jesus with the bride now
[59:36] notice this and I'll I'll try to slow
[59:39] down because if I go to preaching it too
[59:42] fast guess what you just get caught up
[59:44] with the emotion of the
[59:45] preacher and oh he was very emotional
[59:48] and oh he was fast no this and that no
[59:50] but then we miss what's being said
[59:53] sometimes it's good for us to slow down
[59:55] that's right so we can enunciate so that
[59:57] we can take time and point things out of
[59:59] what's being said Jesus with the bride
[1:00:04] he doesn't say with the church amen with
[1:00:07] the
[1:00:08] bride as king and queen sat at the
[1:00:11] throne white Throne judgment and the
[1:00:14] books were opened so now he's going to
[1:00:16] tell us cuz the Bible says the books
[1:00:19] were opened then another book was opened
[1:00:22] so what books is these that are opened
[1:00:25] he said the book of the
[1:00:30] Sinners so now by prophetic insight and
[1:00:35] by prophetic understanding now we can
[1:00:38] look at Revelations 20 and Daniel 7: 8
[1:00:41] and N whatever it was and we can say
[1:00:44] these books that were opened it was the
[1:00:46] book of The
[1:00:50] Sinner and from this book now these
[1:00:53] Sinners that come before the white
[1:00:55] Throne judgment are going to be judged
[1:00:57] according to their own works that's what
[1:01:00] the scripture says amen that's
[1:01:03] right so one of these groups is standing
[1:01:06] before him notice they're not
[1:01:08] ministering onto him they're standing
[1:01:11] before him it's 10,000s times 10,000s
[1:01:15] who are these
[1:01:17] people to put it very bluntly they're
[1:01:21] Sinners they are people that live their
[1:01:24] lives
[1:01:25] however way they wanted to live it they
[1:01:27] are people that gave their lives over to
[1:01:29] Satan whether they knew it or not they
[1:01:31] lied they stole they cheated they abused
[1:01:35] they raped they did whatever it was that
[1:01:36] they could to get ahead in life why
[1:01:38] because they were
[1:01:40] Sinners because they were born that way
[1:01:43] and they never had a nature change they
[1:01:46] never had a born again experience with
[1:01:48] God therefore uh they were never saved
[1:01:52] amen they were never his and so this is
[1:01:55] where they come up at the white Throne
[1:01:58] judgment and we realize that every
[1:02:01] person that is born in this Earth every
[1:02:05] single person we are all born the same
[1:02:08] way we've all been conceived the same
[1:02:10] way there's only one that was conceived
[1:02:13] by the spoken word and that was Jesus
[1:02:15] Christ Naturally Speaking I want to say
[1:02:18] that the Bride of Jesus Christ her Born
[1:02:21] Again experience is by the spoken word
[1:02:23] of God yes cuz we are birthed the Bible
[1:02:26] says by the word of
[1:02:28] God Adam and Eve never brought forth the
[1:02:31] promise where God told him to replenish
[1:02:34] and multiply the Earth it wasn't
[1:02:36] supposed to come through a a an act
[1:02:38] between a man and a woman but it was
[1:02:40] supposed to come by the spoken word of
[1:02:44] God she was unable to fulfill it because
[1:02:47] she had wrong desires but I'll say this
[1:02:50] from Ephesus to laiaa the scripture of
[1:02:54] Genesis to go forth and multiply by a
[1:02:57] spoken word has been coming to pass
[1:03:00] since Ephesus to
[1:03:03] louia spoken word children of
[1:03:08] God
[1:03:11] hallelujah so in the time that we were
[1:03:14] born in this life God has a book for
[1:03:17] every one of
[1:03:18] us and this is the book that stays with
[1:03:22] our Natural Life so every time that we
[1:03:25] sin from the age of 12 onwards I don't
[1:03:29] have a quote from that for that but
[1:03:30] brother brandham says from the age of 12
[1:03:32] upwards is the age of accountability so
[1:03:35] anything before the age of
[1:03:37] accountability guess what is not held
[1:03:39] against us why because we don't know any
[1:03:41] better God can't hold us accountable for
[1:03:44] something as an immature little child
[1:03:47] that we don't know anything better
[1:03:50] about but when we get to the age of
[1:03:53] accountability
[1:03:54] now God begins to
[1:03:57] journal does any of you Journal it's
[1:04:00] good to journal I tried to journal once
[1:04:04] a
[1:04:07] month ah soon as you turn 12 years old
[1:04:11] wow
[1:04:13] wow you were told to clean up your room
[1:04:16] by your parents 12 years old you ever
[1:04:18] been told to clean up your room by your
[1:04:19] parents 12 years old oh it's clean mom
[1:04:24] it's clean
[1:04:25] [Applause]
[1:04:28] dad lie wow I'm going to write this down
[1:04:32] Stephen did not clean his
[1:04:34] room but he said he
[1:04:38] did so what does that make stevenh a
[1:04:42] liar let's
[1:04:45] continue as Stephen became an
[1:04:49] adolescent he gave his mom and dad an
[1:04:51] attitude that he never should have done
[1:04:56] he told his mom it's none of her
[1:04:58] business where he's been all night he
[1:05:01] told his dad get off of my
[1:05:04] back and guess what he took upon himself
[1:05:07] at the age of 14 a good rebellious
[1:05:11] Spirit you ever heard of a good
[1:05:13] rebellious Spirit oh yeah that's one
[1:05:15] that's really
[1:05:22] bad oh I had one
[1:05:25] and little did I know in my spiritual I
[1:05:29] guess it's as the as the Rebellion is as
[1:05:34] the sin thank you of
[1:05:38] Witchcraft
[1:05:41] wow amen Steven's life started getting
[1:05:44] real heavy real quick why CU Not only
[1:05:48] was he rebellious Not only was he
[1:05:50] disrespectful Not only was he a liar not
[1:05:53] only was he all these things in his
[1:05:55] carnal man but now he's taken part in
[1:06:00] Witchcraft and he doesn't even know
[1:06:03] it why because he's
[1:06:06] rebellious he won't mind his mom and dad
[1:06:10] he won't mind the teachers at
[1:06:13] school he don't care and he's doing what
[1:06:16] he wants when he wants and how he wants
[1:06:17] to do it why because he is a
[1:06:23] sinner
[1:06:24] I didn't ask for it what about you we
[1:06:29] could continue on and go through our 20s
[1:06:31] go through your 30s whatever it is
[1:06:33] however old you are or it was until you
[1:06:36] accepted Christ into your life every
[1:06:39] Idol thought that's right Every Idle
[1:06:42] Word every wrong thing that came through
[1:06:44] your mind every lie that we ever spoke
[1:06:47] every time we took advantage of somebody
[1:06:49] whatever it might have been God was
[1:06:52] journaling it yeah and it was written
[1:06:55] down within a
[1:06:57] book and now he's doing it for a
[1:07:00] purpose because he know there's going to
[1:07:02] come a time where there's a great white
[1:07:05] Throne
[1:07:06] judgment and he's not going to uh he's
[1:07:10] just going to read before us the
[1:07:13] book hi Stephen you did this back then
[1:07:16] no I didn't you can't hide that because
[1:07:19] here it is it's all written in my
[1:07:23] journal
[1:07:24] amen that you didn't even know I was
[1:07:26] taking and I have every downfall every
[1:07:29] Pitfall every wrong thing that you have
[1:07:31] ever done by yielding yourself to Satan
[1:07:35] and it's all right here and these things
[1:07:38] are contrary to my word and I see within
[1:07:43] this
[1:07:44] journal right up until the time of your
[1:07:48] death you never accepted Christ into
[1:07:50] your
[1:07:52] life there was never a change your name
[1:07:55] stayed within this book it was never
[1:07:58] transferred to another book here it is I
[1:08:01] have a place that's prepared for you
[1:08:04] that's what God is doing right whether
[1:08:06] people want to believe it or not God is
[1:08:08] journaling of the life of every
[1:08:11] individual that was born since Canan
[1:08:13] Abel until the last
[1:08:16] ones he's
[1:08:18] journaling I want to ask you if we were
[1:08:21] to read our Journal right what what
[1:08:24] would our Journal say
[1:08:26] right if there was no blood to cover it
[1:08:30] if there was no sacrifice for sin what
[1:08:33] would our Journal be saying about us
[1:08:36] there is not a one of us could stand in
[1:08:38] the presence of
[1:08:42] God
[1:08:47] my there will be no hiding
[1:08:50] there there will be no saying that
[1:08:52] wasn't me there will be no saying I
[1:08:55] didn't think those thoughts because
[1:08:56] it'll be replayed right back to that
[1:09:00] individual there will be no hiding and
[1:09:03] there will be no getting away from it
[1:09:06] God have mercy
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:11] hallelujah so we realize that we have
[1:09:15] this I could call it a book of
[1:09:18] remembrance I suppose and it is a book
[1:09:22] that is written after our our carnal
[1:09:25] life our natural life and because it is
[1:09:28] written according to our natural man
[1:09:31] guess what the things of of this Earth
[1:09:35] is very natural for us to to to uh to go
[1:09:39] towards it is very natural for us to
[1:09:42] want to do the things of the Earth the
[1:09:44] things of the world and and lie and
[1:09:45] steal and do all these different things
[1:09:47] why because we are naturally carnal
[1:09:51] Sinners amen right
[1:09:54] now we realize then that we were all
[1:09:57] born this way at one point in our lives
[1:10:01] guess what we were all a bunch of
[1:10:03] Sinners not just brother stepen but you
[1:10:07] guess what you're a bunch of dirty
[1:10:11] Sinners whether you were born and raised
[1:10:13] in church or not or whether you were
[1:10:15] born in this in the in the downtown
[1:10:18] streets of of Phoenix and vanur and the
[1:10:21] roughest street that you can find guess
[1:10:23] what it doesn't matter if you're raised
[1:10:24] in church or raised in the streets of
[1:10:26] Belfast or wherever it might be guess
[1:10:29] what we are all sinners am that's why we
[1:10:34] are in need of a
[1:10:36] savior and so now one day this kinsman
[1:10:39] redeemer guess what he come by your
[1:10:42] way whether you're in the streets of
[1:10:45] Phoenix Arizona or whatever streets it
[1:10:47] was you were running in whether it was
[1:10:49] in a church service God had an appointed
[1:10:53] time with you and you had an appointed
[1:10:57] time with Destiny a time when your life
[1:11:00] would change forever and God touched
[1:11:04] your heart and he said let us come and
[1:11:07] reason together though your sins be red
[1:11:10] like Scarlet as Isaiah said they shall
[1:11:13] be white as snow though they be red like
[1:11:16] Crimson they shall be white as wool and
[1:11:20] God had a a not a contest with you but
[1:11:22] he had a conference God had a conference
[1:11:26] with you and he said let's reason
[1:11:28] together this life that you're living
[1:11:30] extending you to one place but if you
[1:11:32] would just come on to me if you would
[1:11:34] give me your burden I'll give you my
[1:11:37] burden because my burden is easy and my
[1:11:40] yoke is liked and something changed in
[1:11:42] your life do you remember that amise God
[1:11:45] sir amen what happened I'm not talking
[1:11:49] about making a confession there's many
[1:11:51] people that make a confession in
[1:11:53] Christianity but they never go forth to
[1:11:55] a new birth experience it goes further
[1:11:59] than confession but it goes to a
[1:12:02] supernatural birth Supernatural birth
[1:12:05] where you know that you've met God face
[1:12:08] to
[1:12:09] face that's right brother stepen how do
[1:12:12] I
[1:12:13] know how do I know that I've met
[1:12:16] him how do I know that something
[1:12:19] happened your life will bear witness
[1:12:22] amen and you'll be like Paul and you'll
[1:12:24] say those things that I that I once
[1:12:27] loved I now hate and those things that I
[1:12:30] once held to I I guess what I count them
[1:12:32] as dung and and and I'm going to forget
[1:12:34] those things because they don't interest
[1:12:36] me no more and I'm going to press
[1:12:38] forward towards the mark and the high
[1:12:40] calling in Christ Jesus I'm not going to
[1:12:42] look back I'm I'm going to move forward
[1:12:45] why because my life is
[1:12:47] changing thank you Lord if you will let
[1:12:50] God change your life God will change
[1:12:53] your life will if you let God into your
[1:12:57] situations and drop your pride God will
[1:12:59] take care of the
[1:13:01] situations hallelujah amen praise God
[1:13:06] Amen praise him so we realize that it's
[1:13:09] not just a confession onto
[1:13:12] repentance but it is a
[1:13:15] birth the word in the seed of God
[1:13:17] breaking forth and bringing life into
[1:13:20] your life
[1:13:22] amen notice this the invisible Union of
[1:13:25] the bride of Christ well you separated
[1:13:28] from your first Union what is that First
[1:13:31] Union is when we were born in this earth
[1:13:34] we were married to the carnal man we
[1:13:36] were married to Satan and we didn't even
[1:13:37] know it amen so now we are separated
[1:13:40] from our first Union by spiritual death
[1:13:44] now you are born again or remarried
[1:13:47] again to the new spiritual union of not
[1:13:50] your natural life of the things of the
[1:13:52] world but eternal life that germ that
[1:13:56] was in you at the beginning found you
[1:13:58] that's
[1:13:59] amazing for me that's amazing cuz it
[1:14:02] lets me know that he was looking for me
[1:14:05] I wasn't out here looking for God but
[1:14:07] the word of God had found me the word of
[1:14:10] God will find you wherever it is that
[1:14:12] you're hiding whatever uh uh though
[1:14:15] you're covered in the merry clay of loud
[1:14:17] you see the word of God will find
[1:14:22] you thank you
[1:14:23] he came looking for
[1:14:25] me when I was lost in sin he came
[1:14:29] looking for me before I knew that I
[1:14:31] needed a savior right
[1:14:34] Hallelujah now your name and your
[1:14:37] old has been transferred what's he
[1:14:40] talking about the old book the book of
[1:14:43] your natural Life the book that the
[1:14:45] journal that God has been taken down
[1:14:47] from us since the age of accountability
[1:14:49] up to this point now our name is being
[1:14:52] transferred from that book to another
[1:14:56] book what does that mean it means
[1:14:58] there's hope it means that I have a
[1:15:01] chance of making it why because those
[1:15:03] things the ordinances that were once
[1:15:06] against me guess what now they're
[1:15:08] blotted
[1:15:09] out they're not against me no
[1:15:12] moreen thank you Jesus he says do you
[1:15:16] mean to tell me my old book he says God
[1:15:18] put it in the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:15:20] you stand perfectly before God now your
[1:15:22] name is now the new book not the book of
[1:15:25] life but the Lamb's Book of Life what
[1:15:26] the lamb redeemed not the old book of
[1:15:29] your natural Union notice he's making a
[1:15:31] distinction of these two books so
[1:15:34] there's a distinction between your old
[1:15:37] man and the born again man you need to
[1:15:40] make a distinction between your old man
[1:15:43] and your born again
[1:15:45] man that's where the problem lies God
[1:15:49] can make the distinction but we have a
[1:15:52] hard time and dividing the flesh from
[1:15:54] the
[1:15:57] spiritual he says not the old book of
[1:15:59] your natural Union by your new bride
[1:16:03] Hallelujah your new life is in the
[1:16:05] Lamb's Book of Life your marriage
[1:16:07] certificate Hallelujah where your true
[1:16:10] Eternal germ from the beginning takes
[1:16:12] hold your true who you really are who
[1:16:16] you really are deep down inside it takes
[1:16:19] a hold why because he found you
[1:16:22] Hallelujah that's right now you're not
[1:16:25] only forgiven but you're
[1:16:27] Justified Glory Justified Romans 51 said
[1:16:30] yeah Romans 51 said therefore being
[1:16:32] justified by faith brother brandham said
[1:16:36] the the book of our first birth our
[1:16:38] marriage has been cast into the sea of
[1:16:41] God's
[1:16:42] forgetfulness now does that mean that
[1:16:44] God is this this little uh old grandpa
[1:16:48] that sits up in the ramp parts of heaven
[1:16:50] and he's getting so old that he forgets
[1:16:52] things say no no oh I can't remember
[1:16:56] what he did 20 years ago so I guess it
[1:16:59] never happened anyway in the first place
[1:17:02] no he can't remember because you are
[1:17:06] Justified right amen the book that was
[1:17:09] once against You Now does not exist
[1:17:12] anymore it's been taken care of God took
[1:17:16] care of it at Calvary by the washing of
[1:17:19] Blood by the shedding of his blood God
[1:17:22] took care of your old book so not only
[1:17:25] is it cast into the sea of his
[1:17:26] forgetfulness but it's absolutely
[1:17:29] destroyed God took care of it God took
[1:17:32] care of your sin therefore it is not
[1:17:35] brought to God's remembrance anymore why
[1:17:37] because it doesn't exist that's right
[1:17:40] the book is not there though Satan can
[1:17:43] come before God and say look what he's
[1:17:46] doing look what he did look what he
[1:17:48] thought look what he said look at this
[1:17:50] look what they done in their past and
[1:17:51] God said I have no idea idea what you're
[1:17:53] talking about because it doesn't exist
[1:17:56] anymore there's a bumper between the sin
[1:17:59] that he now commits it's the bumper of
[1:18:01] the blood of Jesus Christ your
[1:18:04] accusations sound good but they're not
[1:18:07] true therefore Satan you're a liar get
[1:18:10] out of my
[1:18:12] presence but now it's up to us to have
[1:18:15] that same attitude to look at ourselves
[1:18:18] of how God is looking at us and to make
[1:18:20] a
[1:18:21] distinction amen between who you really
[1:18:25] are as a germ seed of God yes amen and
[1:18:29] the flesh man right that was born in
[1:18:31] this world help us they are two very
[1:18:34] very different beings they are two very
[1:18:37] very different
[1:18:39] people and you know what I'm talking
[1:18:41] about CU you live with both of them on a
[1:18:43] daily
[1:18:44] basis
[1:18:46] amen good brother but let me encourage
[1:18:48] you this guy here it's not the real guy
[1:18:54] it is just something that is sent to
[1:18:56] hinder you to bring forth who you really
[1:19:00] arek you there's always a hindrance when
[1:19:03] the when the children of Israel when
[1:19:05] they went into the promised land guess
[1:19:07] what they didn't kill all of the um the
[1:19:10] uh uh Canaanites and all these different
[1:19:13] guys no there was some of them that was
[1:19:15] left why to prove Israel if there's one
[1:19:19] thing that is to prove the seed of God
[1:19:21] it is your flesh man
[1:19:28] there's a distinction my brother and my
[1:19:30] sister there's a
[1:19:34] distinction make the right
[1:19:37] distinction of who you really are look
[1:19:40] he said it there of who you really are
[1:19:43] as a seed gening of God and who this
[1:19:46] flesh man is that was born in carnality
[1:19:51] amen amen
[1:19:55] Colossians 2:14 and 15 and you being
[1:19:58] dead in your sins and the UN
[1:20:00] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[1:20:03] quickened together with him having
[1:20:05] forgiven you some of your trespasses
[1:20:09] having forgiven a wee bit of your
[1:20:11] trespasses no when God does something he
[1:20:13] does it right having forgiven all
[1:20:16] somebody say all say it again you didn't
[1:20:18] mean it that's right all of your
[1:20:21] trespasses than blotting out the
[1:20:24] handwriting of ordinances that was once
[1:20:27] against us notice these handwriting of
[1:20:29] ordinances at one time were true and
[1:20:32] they were against you but they've been
[1:20:34] blotted out how by the blood of Jesus
[1:20:36] Christ nailing it to his cross
[1:20:39] Hallelujah so those things that were
[1:20:42] once against us when Satan could come
[1:20:44] and and and and tell God hey look at
[1:20:47] this right they're blotted out he
[1:20:50] doesn't see it than he doesn't
[1:20:52] understand what say why because it
[1:20:54] doesn't exist any
[1:20:57] longer am
[1:21:00] Hallelujah that gives an old sinner boy
[1:21:02] like me from Ireland a bit of
[1:21:04] Hope really
[1:21:06] does so now we are separated from our
[1:21:09] first Union through our first Birth by
[1:21:13] spiritual death by being born again
[1:21:16] because we are loosed from that original
[1:21:20] Union by Death
[1:21:24] right and so we realize that even the
[1:21:28] union between a man and a woman there's
[1:21:32] only one thing that can lose those
[1:21:35] people with that Union as the scripture
[1:21:38] says as long as that man is
[1:21:41] alive she is bound to her husband as
[1:21:44] long as he liveth
[1:21:46] right and as long as that woman is alive
[1:21:50] he is bound to that woman as long as she
[1:21:53] liveth
[1:21:55] amen well why then did Moses give us a
[1:21:59] bill of divorcement he said because of
[1:22:01] the uh the hardness of your heart but it
[1:22:05] wasn't so from the
[1:22:08] beginning you're trying to say brother
[1:22:10] stepen marriage and divorce is not so
[1:22:12] from the beginning that's
[1:22:13] exactly what I'm saying
[1:22:16] amen young people guys choose your wife
[1:22:21] prayerfully you got one shot yeah one
[1:22:25] shot you mess it up you're bound yeah
[1:22:30] until the other passes
[1:22:32] away same thing girls don't mess it
[1:22:35] up don't get all infatuated with the one
[1:22:39] Prince charman that comes along on his
[1:22:41] White Horse and really broad shoulders
[1:22:44] and tells you you're
[1:22:47] pretty guess what he might be lying if
[1:22:50] he's a sinner he's probably
[1:22:54] lying got one
[1:22:57] shot you mess it up you're done well so
[1:23:00] and so got so so and so is married
[1:23:04] divorced and
[1:23:07] remarried that's
[1:23:10] tough how do you say about that brother
[1:23:14] Stephen I say this in Simplicity and God
[1:23:17] knows my heart am that's between them
[1:23:20] and God amen amen right but everything
[1:23:24] we believe comes back to the scripture
[1:23:26] sir right yes sir until death do us
[1:23:32] part so it is with our spiritual
[1:23:35] life our natural Union with our carnal
[1:23:39] man and Satan guess what through
[1:23:41] spiritual death guess what has happened
[1:23:43] we've been loosed from it Hallelujah
[1:23:45] because God is not going to marry a
[1:23:48] woman who is still bound to a man good
[1:23:52] but he'll marry a woman who is free yes
[1:23:55] and is able to be married yes hallelujah
[1:24:00] amen amen and so now we see that we are
[1:24:04] married to Christ the word becoming one
[1:24:07] with the word through our invisible
[1:24:11] Union with him
[1:24:13] amen so now our Union guess what we
[1:24:16] don't necessarily see it right off the
[1:24:20] bat but as a man and a woman when they
[1:24:23] first get married and they're and
[1:24:24] they're younger guess what they we
[1:24:27] really don't know what love
[1:24:30] is we don't know how to love one another
[1:24:34] cuz whether we want to admit it or not
[1:24:36] we're immature amen We're
[1:24:39] Young and the one thing that we love
[1:24:42] typically is
[1:24:45] ourselves we love
[1:24:47] ourselves we don't know how to love
[1:24:49] anything else but as our marriage Contin
[1:24:52] continues I'm speaking by my own
[1:24:55] experience as a man as an immature
[1:24:58] person who got married I realize that as
[1:25:01] the years go by I've been married 10 11
[1:25:03] years here in March and I realize as
[1:25:06] each year goes on I learn more and how
[1:25:09] to love my wife amen I don't understand
[1:25:12] it right all right off the bat and as
[1:25:15] the days go on I learn more things about
[1:25:18] myself that I don't like that I need to
[1:25:21] work on
[1:25:23] and so it is with our Union with Christ
[1:25:26] when we first get married to Christ and
[1:25:29] and and we come to a new birth
[1:25:31] experience and oh my it's all it's all
[1:25:33] love and joy and and and fluffy clouds
[1:25:35] and everything's awesome we really don't
[1:25:37] know how to love
[1:25:39] God true but when our true love for God
[1:25:42] comes out of our Lives is when we are
[1:25:44] pressed in the
[1:25:46] dirt as the the the best grapes grapes
[1:25:50] just don't produce wine but they pray
[1:25:53] they're trampled upon the rose of Sharon
[1:25:56] how does it bring out that perfume it is
[1:25:59] crushed and so when we go through life
[1:26:02] and we're pressed and we're crushed and
[1:26:04] many things happen to us that we don't
[1:26:06] understand why it brings out a love for
[1:26:09] God if we've been born again amen it
[1:26:12] brings out a love for God in our hearts
[1:26:15] and we realize and we learn how to love
[1:26:19] God Amen right Lord very good and so now
[1:26:24] as the days go on as we that's right
[1:26:27] brother you hear these these Elders
[1:26:29] brother Ron will say he'll say uh I love
[1:26:31] God more now than when I did when I
[1:26:34] first got converted well you don't
[1:26:36] understand that until you're further
[1:26:38] down the road the truth of the matter is
[1:26:41] you know how to love him more amen you
[1:26:44] know how to love God more because you've
[1:26:47] been in the relationship for a longer
[1:26:51] time hallelujah amen
[1:26:56] amen so if these 10,000 times 10,000s
[1:27:02] that stood before him are sinners with
[1:27:05] their books opened who then is these
[1:27:08] other people these thousands times
[1:27:10] thousands that Minister onto him on this
[1:27:13] day of the great white Throne judgment
[1:27:16] questions and answers 1964 brother
[1:27:18] Brenham answers it now notice in this
[1:27:21] second Resurrection
[1:27:22] when they come up then Satan's
[1:27:25] loosed uh I already read that one I'll
[1:27:27] read it again out of his prison for a
[1:27:29] little season then the judgment is set
[1:27:31] now watch Jesus with the bride as king
[1:27:34] and queen at the throne white Throne
[1:27:35] judgment and the books were opened the
[1:27:37] book of Sinners and another book was
[1:27:39] opened which was The Book of Life This
[1:27:42] Book of Life is a very important yet a
[1:27:46] complex
[1:27:47] book it's a whole sermon on its own but
[1:27:51] anyways I'll hit at the high points know
[1:27:53] ye not um and every man that was judged
[1:27:56] thus by the bride so who are who are
[1:28:00] these people judged by they're judged by
[1:28:03] the bride king and queen know ye not
[1:28:07] taken these little manners before the
[1:28:08] law know ye not that the Saints shall
[1:28:10] judge the Earth CC all right what is
[1:28:12] brother brandham doing exactly what a
[1:28:14] prophet is supposed to do he brings us
[1:28:17] back to the scripture amen here's
[1:28:20] another one the first seal the queen of
[1:28:22] Heaven is the selected bride of Christ
[1:28:24] and she comes with him Daniel saw it
[1:28:27] what is he talking about he's talking
[1:28:29] about remember there's three comings of
[1:28:31] the Lord come to redeem his bride he
[1:28:34] comes with his bride for his bride and
[1:28:37] then he comes with his
[1:28:39] bride okay so he's saying there uh she
[1:28:43] comes with him Daniel saw it and said
[1:28:46] 10,000 times 10,000s ministered to him
[1:28:49] now if you'll watch the scripture the
[1:28:51] judgment was set and the books were open
[1:28:54] now remember when he come he come with
[1:28:57] his
[1:28:58] bride the wife ministers to her husband
[1:29:02] and 10,000s time 10 thousands of
[1:29:04] thousands ministered to him judgment was
[1:29:07] set and the books were opened and
[1:29:09] another book was opened which is The
[1:29:11] Book of Life not the bride at all right
[1:29:17] he said she has done gone up in the
[1:29:20] Rapture and come back
[1:29:22] and standing there in Judgment of those
[1:29:24] Generations that refuse the gospel
[1:29:29] message who are these people that is
[1:29:31] sitting
[1:29:32] judging with King Jesus it's the bride 1
[1:29:36] Corinthians 6 verse 2 do you not know
[1:29:39] that the Saints shall judge the world
[1:29:41] and if the world shall be judged by you
[1:29:43] are ye unworthy to judge the smaller
[1:29:47] matters the bride of Christ does not
[1:29:49] stand judgment on that day at at the
[1:29:52] white Throne judgment why because she
[1:29:54] has already received her judgment being
[1:29:57] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[1:30:00] she was judged as the body of Christ was
[1:30:03] judged that day at Calvary amen
[1:30:07] hallelujah amen glory hallelujah amen
[1:30:12] her name is written in the Lamb's Book
[1:30:15] of
[1:30:16] Life which is a part of the book of life
[1:30:20] it is not a separate book there is not
[1:30:23] three books there's not the books of the
[1:30:26] Sinners uh The Book of Life and the
[1:30:29] Lamb's Book of Life as three separate
[1:30:31] books there's two
[1:30:32] books there's the books to the Sinners
[1:30:36] there's the Lamb's Book there's the book
[1:30:38] of life but written within the Book of
[1:30:41] Life there is a
[1:30:42] section that is called the Lamb's Book
[1:30:46] of Life and written in that section of
[1:30:49] the book of life is the names of of
[1:30:52] every single predestinated son and
[1:30:54] daughter of God from the time of Ephesus
[1:30:57] right up until now who are these people
[1:30:59] that's written within this section it's
[1:31:02] the Lamb's
[1:31:05] wife and the Lamb's wife now she is bone
[1:31:09] of his bone and flesh of his flesh she
[1:31:12] is
[1:31:14] him so therefore brother Bram always
[1:31:17] told us and he said that that God is
[1:31:20] going to judge the World by Jesus Christ
[1:31:23] who is the
[1:31:26] word so now here stands his bride with
[1:31:30] him they are one and they are the same
[1:31:34] so when the Judgment comes forth and
[1:31:36] they're being judged guess what Sinners
[1:31:38] they're just hey sinner this old life
[1:31:41] this this book of sin that I have of you
[1:31:43] um this book yeah there you go I have a
[1:31:46] place prepared for you I'm not even
[1:31:47] going to waste my time hardly on you cuz
[1:31:50] I know you're in this you have this
[1:31:53] book but there are those in the Book of
[1:31:57] Life brother brandham says such as
[1:32:00] foolish virgin even Judas is
[1:32:04] scariot had his name written within the
[1:32:06] book of life and brother brandham said
[1:32:09] his name was blotted out of the book why
[1:32:12] because he sold out he sold his
[1:32:15] Birthright he was justified he was
[1:32:19] Sanctified he cast out devils he took
[1:32:22] care of the money he did all these
[1:32:23] different things he had a walk with God
[1:32:26] he walked with the disciples but yet
[1:32:28] when it came down the time to be truly
[1:32:31] born again yes to truly be sealed of God
[1:32:34] to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:37] he sold out for 30 pieces of silver amen
[1:32:41] go read the quotes brother bradam says
[1:32:43] and here's you Methodist and you Baptist
[1:32:45] and you different ones that have been
[1:32:47] presented with the word of God for this
[1:32:49] day you're selling out your birth
[1:32:53] rights why for a meal ticket because
[1:32:57] you're scared of what somebody else is
[1:32:58] going to say whatever it might be hey
[1:33:01] you've sold out I'm blotting your name
[1:33:03] out of The Book of
[1:33:05] Life TR
[1:33:08] my it gets really deep yes really quick
[1:33:13] yeah gets really serious yeah I saw a
[1:33:15] quote and I should have printed it I got
[1:33:18] a few more minutes here I should have
[1:33:20] printed it brother brandham goes he's
[1:33:21] talking about the people that that are
[1:33:24] out in the
[1:33:25] jungles and he says those people that
[1:33:28] never hear the gospel this quote struck
[1:33:32] me he said that they've never heard the
[1:33:35] gospel God has a place for those people
[1:33:39] yes because he is a just God right and
[1:33:42] he is a fair God and he'll never bring
[1:33:44] anybody into judgment unless they've
[1:33:47] heard the word to be judged by right but
[1:33:50] he says you people
[1:33:52] that know the word and you've heard the
[1:33:54] word he said if you don't go and tell
[1:33:58] them they're blood is on
[1:34:01] you and we will be held
[1:34:05] accountable for not spreading the truth
[1:34:07] of the Gospel of this end
[1:34:10] time my my my my my and here some of us
[1:34:14] were scared to share that God sent the
[1:34:16] prophet with our neighbor
[1:34:19] on that we're scared to tell the people
[1:34:22] at work this is exactly what I believe I
[1:34:25] believe God sent the prophet I believe
[1:34:26] that these scriptures are have have been
[1:34:28] fulfilled in this end time we need to be
[1:34:31] careful my brother and my sister if God
[1:34:34] gives us opportunity to share of the
[1:34:37] hope that lays within us don't shy away
[1:34:40] from it because God might hold us
[1:34:44] accountable for that person never
[1:34:46] hearing truth amen any moment you get in
[1:34:49] your life any moment that I get in my
[1:34:52] life we should be saying father how can
[1:34:54] I share the truth with this person
[1:34:58] amen amen how can I tell this person the
[1:35:02] truth within the
[1:35:03] assembly it goes further than just
[1:35:06] sharing what we believe but if you know
[1:35:08] somebody is doing wrong and you don't
[1:35:09] say anything about
[1:35:12] it how much is God going to hold to our
[1:35:15] charge of the things that we hold back
[1:35:17] because we're scared to say truth amen
[1:35:21] my my my my my God help us
[1:35:26] amen father God that when we have
[1:35:29] opportunity yes sir and you'll know it

[1:35:37] that to share what you believe with
[1:35:40] somebody else and you're going to
[1:35:42] remember these words and you're going to
[1:35:44] be
[1:35:45] scared and you're going to be bashful
[1:35:48] and there's going to be many thoughts
[1:35:49] that'll come to your mind and you'll say
[1:35:51] say well I'm in a place of authority and

[1:38:35] daughter of
[1:38:36] God they receive eternal
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:43] life so what is what is this all
[1:38:47] about as as I think of the many trials
[1:38:53] and
[1:38:54] temptations the crushing de pressings
[1:38:58] that we go through in
[1:39:00] life what is it all about what is the
[1:39:03] purpose of
[1:39:04] it I know for one thing that God is
[1:39:08] molding our
[1:39:10] [Music]
[1:39:11] character and he's wanting us to get rid
[1:39:14] of this old carnal nature and to take on
[1:39:18] the character of
[1:39:20] Christ who learned obedience by the
[1:39:22] things he suffered that's
[1:39:24] right and the more things that we go
[1:39:27] through in life and the many issues that
[1:39:30] arise God's doing it for a purpose
[1:39:33] because power without
[1:39:36] character is
[1:39:39] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:39:43] to rule amen it's fit to judge you know
[1:39:48] as the Bride of Jesus Christ at that
[1:39:51] time we will become the full word and
[1:39:55] full manifestation that's
[1:39:57] right you won't have to deal with your
[1:40:00] carnal man
[1:40:02] anymore and when those people come up to
[1:40:05] be judged before you you're not going to
[1:40:08] have to go well well let me look in the
[1:40:10] scripture and let me see where that is
[1:40:13] wrong written within the word because
[1:40:16] because I got to judge it by the word
[1:40:18] no you'll be so United with the
[1:40:22] word that the word within you it won't
[1:40:25] just be on the tip of your tongue but
[1:40:27] it'll come out like a well of Living
[1:40:31] Water amen and at one time when it used
[1:40:34] to be grace in our lives as a bride of
[1:40:36] Christ which is what we're living in
[1:40:38] right now that Grace will turn to
[1:40:42] judgment who are these people these 10
[1:40:46] these thousands times thousands is none
[1:40:48] other than the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:40:52] why are they there because they have
[1:40:55] become the word amen who are these other
[1:40:59] people these other people are sinners
[1:41:00] who's this one thank God for prophetic
[1:41:04] Insight because without the inside of
[1:41:07] Malachi 4 guess what we would have no
[1:41:10] idea what these scriptures mean we would
[1:41:13] have no idea who these people are we
[1:41:15] would have no idea what these books are
[1:41:17] and what they represent but because we
[1:41:19] have an insight a prophetic Insight
[1:41:22] guess what now we can look with our
[1:41:24] wondering eyes and we can say wow that's
[1:41:28] what the scripture said and now we can
[1:41:31] take a magnifying glass and we can put
[1:41:33] it upon it with a message book and
[1:41:37] go before our wondering eyes good the
[1:41:40] word is being fulfilled and the word is
[1:41:43] being manifested praise the Lord let's
[1:41:45] stand
[1:41:49] together I trust that that you've been
[1:41:51] blessed this
[1:41:53] evening it's just another little part in
[1:41:56] the drama of God of God unfolding
[1:41:59] himself to us as the Bride of Jesus
[1:42:02] Christ knowing that when this time on
[1:42:05] this Earth is over as time as we know it
[1:42:08] guess what God still isn't finished with
[1:42:11] us yet but he'll have a work for us to
[1:42:14] do Hallelujah let's pray father Lord I
[1:42:18] certainly thank you for this for this
[1:42:21] thought Lord that you've placed on our
[1:42:22] heart and and father God of of a time of
[1:42:27] of
[1:42:28] judgment that lays ahead
[1:42:31] Lord and perhaps Lord there are some no
[1:42:35] doubt that as we were ministering they
[1:42:38] can see their their book of their
[1:42:42] natural life that lays before
[1:42:45] them and father I ask that this would be
[1:42:49] thought provoking to them to realize
[1:42:52] that nothing can be hid from you Lord
[1:42:56] that All Things are Written in the
[1:42:58] Journal of Our Lives of the wrong things
[1:43:01] that we have done but father God not to
[1:43:04] end on that note but to realize that
[1:43:08] there has
[1:43:09] been a lamb that was slain before the
[1:43:12] foundations of the world that by having
[1:43:16] faith in the finished work of Calvary
[1:43:19] through a born again exper erience this
[1:43:21] old book that had all those things
[1:43:24] written against us father is destroyed
[1:43:28] in the sea of your forgetfulness thank
[1:43:30] you Lord never to be remembered no more
[1:43:33] and now we
[1:43:34] live by a new book now we live Lord by
[1:43:39] an open book A book our our book used to
[1:43:43] contain words of death and sorrow and
[1:43:46] and and evil things but now this this
[1:43:50] new book Lord it produces a life of good
[1:43:54] it produces a life of sanctification of
[1:43:58] of Holiness of love and and not hatred
[1:44:01] Lord the things that are completely
[1:44:03] opposite to our carnal man and so father
[1:44:06] I just ask that you would just be with
[1:44:09] us now the remainder of the week
[1:44:12] Lord as we go to bed tonight father may
[1:44:15] you speak to
[1:44:18] us may we have the eyes Sal of the Holy
[1:44:21] Spirit Lord father God to look into the
[1:44:25] depths of our lives and to see where we
[1:44:27] need you more father I love you and
[1:44:30] thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[1:44:33] amen I want to encourage
[1:44:38] you so much of the time we get caught up
[1:44:41] with our carnal
[1:44:43] man because it's what we know amen it's
[1:44:47] what we've lived with for all these
[1:44:49] years
[1:44:51] those of you that are a part of the
[1:44:54] economy of God I'm going to give it to
[1:44:56] everybody you judge yourself you need to
[1:45:00] stop trying to dig up the old book of
[1:45:05] remembrance that is cast into the sea of
[1:45:07] God's
[1:45:09] forgetfulness when Satan brings to your
[1:45:12] remembrance of the things that you've
[1:45:14] done wrong tell him Satan my name has
[1:45:18] been transferred to another book
[1:45:21] Hallelujah and so though I am wrong in
[1:45:23] some things and I fall and I fail and I
[1:45:26] overreact and I do all of these
[1:45:28] different things Satan by Revelation I'm
[1:45:31] telling you that old book that you're
[1:45:33] talking about it's in the sea of God's
[1:45:36] forgetfulness therefore you cannot hold
[1:45:38] it against me any longer I am free I am
[1:45:42] freed by the blood of Jesus
[1:45:46] Christ remind yourself these things on a
[1:45:50] daily daily basis because in a daily
[1:45:53] basis you will be tempted on a daily
[1:45:56] basis it will be brought to your
[1:45:58] Rememberance but on a daily basis if you
[1:46:01] bring that to his remembrance tell him
[1:46:04] where you're destined for guess what
[1:46:07] it'll make you free in this
[1:46:10] life hallelujah amen let go of it amen

[1:46:42] lie of Satan and Satan I'm telling you
[1:46:45] right now I feel God really inspiring in
[1:46:48] this to me right now some of you are
