[2:36] [Music]
[2:51] A New Day Has dawned and I see not what
[2:57] it brings
[2:59] but somehow I can feel
[3:03] I'm almost home
[3:06] I'm not turning back to yesterday but
[3:11] pressing towards my calling in Christ I
[3:16] can hear my theophany calling me
[3:21] and I can hear
[3:26] life
[3:33] it's almost
[3:35] [Music]
[3:46] and I know
[3:49] him on High
[3:54] the whole earth is groaning
[3:59] [Music]
[4:02] with me as the bride will be glorified
[4:07] in him and Saints even though you may

[4:13] standing
[4:18] for your Perfection is Drawing Near
[4:24] and can't you hear
[4:28] you're the only calling you it's a
[4:34] sign it's almost home time
[4:39] and I'm just a
[4:42] waiting for my promise body change
[4:48] [Music]
[4:54] oh
[4:57] my God knows the end of time is
[5:05] very soon
[5:08] the dead in Christ shall rise again
[5:13] there'll be no sickness and no more
[5:17] crying over there
[5:23] now just keep pressing
[5:26] and can't you hear
[5:30] you're the only calling you
[5:34] it's just
[5:37] fine it's almost home
[5:42] and I'm just away
[5:47] for my promise body change
[5:51] [Music]
[6:18] for my promise body change
[6:22] [Music]
[6:47] [Applause]
[6:53] amen praise the Lord
[6:55] I certainly enjoyed that song special
[6:58] amen that's a sermon in itself
[7:01] I believe that that is happening right
[7:03] now I believe the Supernatural is going
[7:04] on I believe you're hearing from a
[7:07] supernatural realm what is it your
[7:08] theophany is calling you amen so we all
[7:11] bear witness of that if you're not you
[7:13] should be yeah
[7:14] amen that God be drawing you up higher
[7:17] into higher places in Christ amen I
[7:19] greet you all tonight in the lovely name
[7:21] of Jesus Christ
[7:24] um uh I just wanted to give you a little
[7:26] bit of an update Sandy and I drove up to
[7:28] Payson on Monday to go look at a
[7:31] possibility of a youth camp because
[7:33] Prescott Pines Camp where we've had it
[7:36] for the past decade or so
[7:40] um was sold and they won't allow us to
[7:44] have place in the camp again so we
[7:47] started looking around and we found one
[7:50] camp that had a possibility so we went
[7:52] up there on Monday and we toured the
[7:55] camp on Tuesday Sandy and I did there
[7:58] was about four to six inches of fresh
[8:00] snow on the ground and it was quite cold
[8:02] outside but anyway long story short it
[8:05] has a great possibility and uh of course
[8:10] you know that most of the camps are all
[8:12] filled up all summer and everything
[8:14] thing and I said do you have any
[8:16] openings whatsoever anywhere and he said
[8:20] well the last week in July last week in
[8:23] July that would be a Friday Saturday and
[8:26] Sunday
[8:27] uh the Lord willing we will see I want
[8:31] to take a few of our youth leaders and
[8:34] technicians and different ones and go
[8:36] look at it and and see and get their yay
[8:40] and nay or whatever on this and we look
[8:44] at it but it's something a a great
[8:47] possibility right now and of everything
[8:50] that we looked at it's the only one
[8:53] uh that even allows us the other camps
[8:57] they're Limited in the amount of people
[8:59] and then also they want to use their
[9:01] ministers to minister to you well that's
[9:03] not why we have again
[9:05] because we're there for the word not for
[9:07] somebody else to admit it we want the
[9:09] Holy Spirit to minister to us and so uh
[9:13] just be in prayer on that we will keep
[9:15] you posted but right now it looks very
[9:17] promising uh and I'll be working with
[9:20] brother Robert and some of the different
[9:21] ones to see if we can actually make it
[9:24] concrete and we can actually uh
[9:27] get the camp so we'll see and I just
[9:30] wanted to say this also
[9:33] um just before service in the back room
[9:35] I was led of the Holy Spirit and I just
[9:39] opened my Bible I felt to go to
[9:41] Ecclesiastes chapter 11.
[9:44] I just something said Ecclesiastes
[9:48] chapter 11.
[9:50] and verse 6.
[9:52] and so I was reading down because there
[9:55] was something in my mind that had caught
[9:57] I thought it was Ecclesiastes five or
[9:59] six
[10:00] and so I was reading down and uh
[10:03] Ecclesiastes 11 6 says in the morning so
[10:06] thy seed
[10:08] and in the evening withhold not thine
[10:11] hand for thou knowest not wither
[10:15] shall prosper either this or that or
[10:19] whether they both shall be alike good
[10:23] and brother James said but the verse
[10:27] above that
[10:28] says Thou knowest not what is the way of
[10:31] the spirit nor how the bones do grow in
[10:33] the womb of her that is with child
[10:37] and I said he says brother Ron I almost
[10:41] chose that for my sermon tonight
[10:44] now imagine of all the scriptures
[10:47] and of everything that you could be led
[10:50] to go read and not very seldom and these
[10:52] brothers no very seldom do I I read a
[10:55] scripture in the back room before the
[10:58] service and I read that and brother
[11:00] James said yeah I think the verse before
[11:01] about the the bones growing in the womb
[11:05] I said
[11:06] what I said that is not coincidence that
[11:10] is actually there's a channel how many
[11:12] of you know that there is a channel of
[11:13] the holy spirit that he is working with
[11:16] not only here but with his bride around
[11:19] the world huh yes and uh for the Sons
[11:24] and Daughters of God that are led by the
[11:27] spirit they are

[11:31] the spirit

[15:13] we humble ourselves once again in your

[15:18] Lord knowing that I can study and I can

[15:31] would you come by our way

[15:37] that we're here to meet that appointment
[15:41] and father we want to be standing on

[15:48] into your hands and we just ask now
[15:51] that you would just come our way and you
[15:53] would just have preeminence in this
[15:54] service
[15:56] Lord touch us in our bodies you see this
[16:00] little sickness that's trying to rise up
[16:01] we're just asking for a touch
[16:05] Lord we commit our time into your hands
[16:08] in Jesus precious name
[16:10] amen
[16:12] amen if you have your Bibles
[16:17] and turn to Ecclesiastes three
[16:22] Ecclesiastes 3 and his brother Ron said
[16:24] I was
[16:26] Ecclesiastes 11 and you know the
[16:30] they put kind of titles above that
[16:32] portion of scripture and
[16:34] it's man doesn't know the works of God
[16:36] you know things that we go through
[16:37] circumstances and stuff but yet we know
[16:40] who holds it
[16:42] but Ecclesiastes 3
[16:45] and verse 1.
[16:48] and it says to everything there is a
[16:50] season
[16:51] a time to every purpose under heaven
[16:55] someone say everything
[16:57] so that includes you
[17:00] everything
[17:03] and Skip down to verse 11 he hath made
[17:06] everything beautiful in his time
[17:10] just to save time we're going to go to
[17:12] verse 14.
[17:13] I know that whatsoever God doeth
[17:16] it shall be forever
[17:19] nothing can be put to it nor anything
[17:21] taken from it
[17:23] and God do with it
[17:25] that men should fear before
[17:29] him
[17:30] if we can turn over to Romans 8
[17:36] Romans 8.
[17:41] a little lengthy reading
[17:44] but I feel to do so
[17:47] and it says and we know
[17:50] that all things work together for the
[17:52] good
[17:53] to them that love God to them who are
[17:56] called according to his purpose
[17:59] for whom he did for no he also did
[18:01] predestinate to be conformed to the
[18:03] image of his son
[18:05] that he might be the firstborn among
[18:07] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[18:09] predestinate than he also called in whom
[18:12] he called he also justified in whom he
[18:15] justified then he also glorified
[18:19] what shall we say then to these things
[18:21] if God before us
[18:23] who can be against us
[18:26] let's get to 33 who shall lay anything
[18:30] to the charge of God's elect
[18:32] it is God that justifies
[18:35] Hallelujah who is he that condemneth it
[18:39] is Christ that died yea rather that is
[18:41] risen again
[18:42] who is even at the right hand of God who
[18:44] maketh intercession for us
[18:47] and who shall separate us from the love
[18:49] of God
[18:51] who shall separate us
[18:54] shall tribulation or distress or
[18:57] persecution
[18:59] or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword
[19:03] What's it gonna take
[19:05] yeah is there anything that can separate
[19:07] us from the love of God you see these
[19:10] things will come right
[19:11] persecution will come yes
[19:19] yes let's skip to 37a and all these
[19:22] things
[19:23] we are more than conquerors through him
[19:26] that loved us
[19:27] for I am fully persuaded how many can
[19:31] say they're persuaded tonight
[19:34] that neither death nor life nor angels
[19:36] or principalities or powers nor things
[19:39] present nor things to come nor heighten
[19:41] or death nor any creature shall separate
[19:43] us from the love of God Amen you can
[19:46] have your seats
[19:49] okay
[19:55] nothing shall separate us
[19:58] from our purpose
[20:01] so tonight a title I'd like to take is a
[20:04] purpose to his appointments a purpose to
[20:07] his appointments and the subject would
[20:10] be your manifested purpose
[20:12] your manifested purpose you see
[20:15] God keeps all his appointments
[20:18] God doesn't do anything by coincidence
[20:21] he doesn't do things
[20:22] haphazardly he doesn't do things halfway
[20:25] but everything that God does he does for
[20:27] a purpose and a reason
[20:29] you see whether it's going through a
[20:31] valley or trial or you're up on the
[20:33] Mountaintop no matter what circumstance
[20:36] you're going through and even as brother
[20:39] Ron said Ecclesiastes 11 man doesn't
[20:42] know what God has for us man doesn't
[20:45] know the plans of God right
[20:48] man doesn't know the way the bones in
[20:52] the belly that that
[20:53] the bones grow in the womb
[20:56] God doesn't know or man doesn't know
[20:58] what God has for us he doesn't know
[21:00] right
[21:01] right but yet there's a purpose to
[21:03] everything to everything there's a
[21:05] season and a Time
[21:07] in the good times and the bad times God
[21:09] will fulfill his purpose
[21:13] brother Branham says the unwelcome
[21:15] Christ
[21:16] Jesus is here tonight Jesus keeps his
[21:19] appointments no matter how you are where
[21:21] you are he kept his PO appointment with
[21:24] Jonah in the belly of the well he kept
[21:27] his appointment with Daniel in the lions
[21:28] den
[21:29] he kept his appointment with the Hebrew
[21:31] children in the fiery furnace praise God
[21:33] he kept his appointment with me on my
[21:35] deathbed
[21:36] he said he's here tonight
[21:38] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[21:40] name I'll be in the midst Jesus keeps
[21:42] all his appointments always
[21:45] and I love how he says this
[21:48] this next portion I kind of
[21:50] the Simplicity that he brings it he says
[21:55] God may have left Glory maybe just a
[21:57] little early tonight
[21:59] to get here on time
[22:02] because God
[22:04] keeps his appointments
[22:07] you see he might have left Glory he
[22:09] might have checked his GPS and he might
[22:11] have seen that there was traffic maybe
[22:13] there was a little bit of weather but
[22:14] yet God left Glory tonight because he
[22:17] had an appointment with each one of us
[22:20] but yet you have to be ready to catch
[22:22] that appointment to recognize that
[22:24] appointment
[22:28] Through the Bible time and time again we
[22:30] see
[22:31] that each character
[22:34] at some point in their life will
[22:36] have an appointment they'll come against
[22:38] a crossroad and they'll have an
[22:40] appointment with God
[22:44] and you see
[22:45] God he uses people in the Bible that I
[22:49] love whenever you read it
[22:51] that it's people it's just ordinary
[22:53] people
[22:55] like you and I they're not some
[22:57] superheroes or they're not Giants why
[23:00] because God wants to show you in his
[23:03] word what's attainable mom
[23:07] you see God uses Ordinary People in in
[23:10] extraordinary ways
[23:17] you take the woman at the well
[23:19] he sent his disciples in
[23:22] because he had an appointment he said
[23:24] I'm going to tarry here
[23:26] because there was somebody that was to
[23:28] come by that way
[23:30] and she was to come and she would begin
[23:32] to talk to this man
[23:34] she didn't know who she he was
[23:38] thank you
[23:39] can he began to talk and it's not
[23:41] customary for you to talk to me and
[23:43] these different things but yet if she
[23:45] knew who he was
[23:46] and as she began to talk
[23:49] he began to listen and he began to
[23:52] discerner
[23:54] and she said we know that a messiah must
[23:56] come and he would say these things what
[23:59] was it she had an appointment with
[24:01] almighty God
[24:03] you see the washer woman
[24:08] she had an appointment with God
[24:10] Jesus sat in the room with religious men
[24:15] with Pharisees
[24:17] men who knew the Bible
[24:20] men who knew he was
[24:22] but yet there was a woman
[24:26] she didn't know why
[24:28] she would go and sell all
[24:31] she would get the very best ointment why
[24:33] because she had an appointment there was
[24:35] something inside of her there was a deep
[24:37] inside of her that knew that I had to
[24:40] get to this spot
[24:41] she didn't know why but God did
[24:44] because he had an appointment with her
[24:51] just using a few examples and Jacob
[24:54] you see Jacob came to a point in his
[24:57] life
[24:59] where he wrestled with God
[25:02] yeah you see each one of us have to do
[25:03] the same correct you young men you're
[25:06] gonna have to wrestle with God
[25:08] you're gonna have to come to a point in
[25:10] your life that you wrestle with God you
[25:12] say well how do I know I changed
[25:15] yeah because he walked differently
[25:20] calling the limping Prophet why because
[25:22] after that he had a different walk to
[25:24] him he had a different step to him
[25:27] you see when you meet God
[25:29] you'll begin to talk and act different
[25:34] the worst sinner in the city
[25:36] in 60 56
[25:38] he said he always keeps his appointments
[25:40] and I love him for that
[25:42] he keeps his appointments that's the
[25:44] reason tonight I got confidence in him
[25:47] he keeps his appointments Hallelujah he
[25:49] never fails he won't never fail
[25:52] and remember man and woman boy and girl
[25:54] you got an appointment with him too yes
[25:57] with him
[25:58] you're going to either meet him in peace
[26:00] here you're going to meet him at the
[26:02] judgment
[26:04] but you're going to keep that
[26:05] appointment
[26:06] that's one thing you're going to do
[26:08] I say God I want to meet him here
[26:11] amen
[26:14] you see we can I'm just building a
[26:17] foundation of having an appointment with
[26:19] God
[26:21] each one of us can say that I've had or
[26:24] at some point come across where God had
[26:26] an appointment with me where he met me
[26:32] you know we all don't have to come a
[26:34] certain way right some come through
[26:36] denomination
[26:38] you know God isn't a respecter of person
[26:41] you know some God can use somebody out
[26:43] there to say something to you
[26:47] and get you to follow get you in in line
[26:51] you know as we use you know
[26:53] denominations in this message or
[26:54] whatever you know he might use somebody
[26:56] that just doesn't believe it if we said
[26:58] like um
[27:00] return Ministry
[27:04] but yet God might use that man
[27:07] at some point in your life to say
[27:08] something
[27:10] to get you to come to the prophet
[27:13] yeah he might not believe it all right
[27:16] you understand
[27:18] but yet God might use him
[27:22] to get you to a point to get you an
[27:24] appointment with him
[27:25] God might use him
[27:28] you see I was talking with Brother David
[27:30] the other day after church and he
[27:31] mentioned even the man
[27:35] that found a message book in a trash can
[27:39] why
[27:40] because he had an appointment with
[27:42] almighty God
[27:51] and you see where
[27:54] we're creatures of habit
[27:58] we revert back to things that we know
[28:03] I'm sure some of us
[28:05] I might raise my hand
[28:07] might have made the same
[28:09] New Year's resolutions as you did last
[28:11] year
[28:13] you might have said this year is the
[28:15] year I'm going to stay in the gym
[28:17] this year I'm going to stay on a diet
[28:19] you see why because we're creatures of
[28:21] habit
[28:23] and if we don't make reading our Bibles
[28:26] and praying and getting into this
[28:28] message a habit
[28:30] what do we do
[28:32] we fall back to things
[28:35] that are easy
[28:37] things that satisfy us
[28:40] growing up dad used to tell us you do
[28:43] things for 21 straight days you may get
[28:45] a habit
[28:51] you see because when hard times come
[28:54] you begin to fall back
[28:57] to the things that your customers are
[28:59] doing
[29:00] but yet if you make this Bible and you
[29:02] make reading and praying and what
[29:04] happens when the hard times come you
[29:06] begin to get on your knees and you begin
[29:07] to seek God
[29:09] sure
[29:14] so Ram says what it takes to overcome
[29:16] all in belief he says now there is a
[29:18] time that a man can come to a place
[29:20] where he can have a purpose
[29:23] this is where I'm going
[29:25] there's a time that a man can have a
[29:27] place where he can have a purpose
[29:29] it's something that will change him and
[29:32] that is when a man meets God
[29:34] a man can never be the same when he
[29:36] meets God face to face
[29:37] it will change him in spite of anything
[29:39] you can do about it a man can never be
[29:42] the same after
[29:44] he wants meets God
[29:47] now that's the truth
[29:49] you see when you meet God face to face
[29:52] when you wrestle with that angel
[29:55] you're going to walk different you're
[29:56] going to talk different
[30:00] I was listening to a sermon the other
[30:02] day third 65
[30:05] . it's a beautiful sermon I
[30:08] suggest you go back and listen to it
[30:11] but he talks about you're identified by
[30:14] the things you thirst after
[30:18] you're identified by the things you
[30:20] thirst after what do you thirsting after
[30:23] now you think carnally
[30:25] yeah you might thirst after he talks
[30:27] about fashion and being able to fit in
[30:30] and thirsting after the things of the
[30:31] world
[30:33] but yet he also brings the balance of
[30:36] thirsting after spiritual things
[30:39] he says there's a need to thirst after
[30:41] spiritual things he says if you thirst
[30:43] after God God will meet you
[30:45] but he says thirsting after God he said
[30:48] when you thirst after God going to
[30:51] church won't satisfy that
[30:53] come on he said thirsting out thirsty
[30:56] after God
[30:58] just meeting just or going to listen to
[31:01] One preacher won't satisfy that
[31:03] he says thirsty after God
[31:07] emotions and Sensations go back and
[31:11] listen
[31:12] he says those things won't satisfy it he
[31:15] says the only thing that will satisfy a
[31:17] thirst for God is meeting him face to
[31:19] face is when you come to a point in your
[31:21] life that you're thirsty and you're
[31:23] hungry and you say God I need more of
[31:25] you God I want more of you
[31:28] the only thing that will satisfy
[31:31] is meeting him face to face
[31:39] you see we all have a purpose
[31:46] and a man who knows who he is
[31:50] and where he is he knows his purpose
[31:54] naturally
[31:57] we have a purpose
[31:59] when I got married
[32:01] my purpose was to be a husband to my
[32:04] wife
[32:05] but yet that purpose grew when we had
[32:08] our son
[32:10] so now it's not that I get rid of my
[32:13] purpose of being a husband
[32:15] but yet you just add to it
[32:18] and now I'm to be a father to my son to
[32:21] teach him to raise him to show him the
[32:23] things of God right
[32:27] right to be there
[32:31] you see and that's the same thing
[32:32] spiritually
[32:34] God's given us a purpose
[32:38] and the only way to find that purpose is
[32:40] in reading and listening to this message
[32:44] digging in for yourself you see so many
[32:47] times that we get even young people they
[32:50] listen to this side you know listen to
[32:52] this pastor or whatever it is
[32:54] and they just think of that that's their
[32:57] Revelation is what they're preached at
[33:00] yet it goes beyond that it's taken you
[33:02] to get into the message to go listen to
[33:04] what the prophet said to understand the
[33:07] full Council of God
[33:09] yeah you see you just can't rely on
[33:11] myself you can't rely on brother Ron
[33:13] Brother Stephen the different ministers
[33:15] just to preach up here and that's you
[33:17] you're me but the Bible says give us
[33:19] this day our daily bread what is that
[33:21] each day seeking yes finding yourself in
[33:24] this message digging into the word
[33:27] he says faith is our Victory he says
[33:29] there's so many people that doesn't seem
[33:31] to have any kind of purpose in life
[33:34] especially in this day that we live now
[33:37] live people just seem to think that all
[33:40] they have to do is keep up with somebody
[33:41] else with the Fashions of the world
[33:43] within the with enticements that the
[33:47] world has given them
[33:49] I'm going to skip down he says
[33:51] let me say this those things are all
[33:53] right he's talking about
[33:55] in the paragraph before he's talking
[33:57] about American ambition and wanting a a
[33:59] salary uh your Sal a raising salary in a
[34:02] new car and a house and different things
[34:04] he says those things are all right but
[34:06] he says that there's a higher ambition
[34:07] in the human life than those things and
[34:10] that Christians have set set their
[34:12] Reflections on the higher ambitions I
[34:15] think it would pay us all to sit down
[34:17] and wonder why we're here
[34:19] in the first place
[34:21] and ever who
[34:22] was kind enough to bring us here we
[34:25] ought to consider and ask him what we
[34:26] have to he had he would have for us to
[34:29] do the purpose of Us coming to fulfill
[34:31] what
[34:32] he has purpose for us
[34:35] but we seem to be just wanting to keep
[34:37] up with the world
[34:40] isn't that sad
[34:46] you know the sad part is is God has a
[34:49] purpose for us but we have to recognize
[34:53] that's right we'll get to it
[34:57] remember a purpose to his appointments
[35:01] and I was reading my Bible the other day
[35:02] and let's turn to John 9.
[35:11] Saint John 9.
[35:18] and this is kind of where I got my
[35:20] thought of purpose to his appointments
[35:22] and
[35:25] and Jesus was to verse 1 and Jesus was
[35:27] to pass by and he saw a man which was
[35:30] blind from his birth
[35:34] and his disciples asked him saying
[35:36] master who did Sin this man or his
[35:38] parents
[35:39] that he was born blind you see the
[35:41] custom then was
[35:45] if somebody had an illness or born blind
[35:47] or something like that a complication it
[35:48] was because somebody had sinned
[35:53] in verse 3 and Jesus said neither this
[35:56] man
[35:57] nor his parents
[36:00] so why was this purpose that this man
[36:03] was born blind
[36:05] but that the works of God
[36:08] should be manifested
[36:11] in him
[36:14] that the works of God
[36:17] might be manifested
[36:19] in him you say God by allowed this man
[36:22] to be born blind for this purpose
[36:24] absolutely
[36:27] why must little Theo go through his
[36:29] complications
[36:31] why do things happen to us
[36:35] yeah why does baby Josiah lay in a
[36:37] hospital bed
[36:39] but yet when we begin to understand that
[36:42] there's a purpose in it
[36:44] yeah and I believe
[36:46] that what that little young man is gonna
[36:49] fulfill his purpose yeah he said brother
[36:52] James what is it I don't know
[36:53] but I know that there's a purpose for it
[36:55] why because God does things in his word
[36:59] and when you begin to see things in his
[37:01] Bible he does things the same way in our
[37:04] day but yet he allowed this to happen
[37:07] yes that the purpose might be made
[37:09] manifest through him
[37:13] and let's skip to verse 5. and I love
[37:16] this
[37:18] and he says as long as I'm in the world
[37:20] I am the light of the world
[37:25] and that kind of got me excited
[37:28] because when you read that
[37:30] that should be you yeah
[37:33] as long as I'm in the world I am the
[37:36] light of the world as long as I'm here
[37:39] come on I am the light as long as I'm
[37:41] here I'm peace as long as I'm here I'm
[37:45] joy as long as here I'm Grace as long as
[37:48] I'm here
[37:49] you see I'm very Christ I'm that same
[37:53] light that shining to the world today
[37:56] [Music]
[37:57] when you begin to see it that I am the
[38:00] light of the world
[38:01] and as long as I'm here I have a purpose
[38:10] you see the Bible says in Matthew 5 and
[38:12] 14 ye are the light of the world a city
[38:15] that is set on a hill which cannot be
[38:17] hid neither do men like candles and put
[38:19] it under a bushel
[38:21] but on a Candlestick it is given a light
[38:24] unto all that are in the house let your
[38:26] light shine so before men that they may
[38:28] see your good works
[38:31] that they may see your good works not to
[38:34] glorify yourself
[38:37] it's not for you
[38:39] but it's to glorify your father you see
[38:42] I had a customer
[38:45] a couple weeks ago
[38:48] I was doing some business and
[38:51] we got done and we began to talk and he
[38:54] has a 16 year old boy who needed surgery
[38:56] I don't know the medical terms but he
[38:58] has a sunken in chest he's 16 years old
[39:01] the older he gets it it causes pressure
[39:03] on the internal organs and so they you
[39:06] know with the heart and the lungs
[39:09] so what they do is they go in and they
[39:11] put a rod they lift the chest and hold
[39:13] it in place
[39:14] very painful
[39:17] and I was doing you know we were just
[39:19] talking and he said James I want you to
[39:21] come pray for my son
[39:24] and I said yeah yeah no problem you know
[39:26] yeah I can do that
[39:30] foreign
[39:31] and you know we left and I said yeah no
[39:34] problem and we left
[39:36] then I got driving down the road
[39:40] and it kind of struck me
[39:43] because he says
[39:46] I want you to go pray for my son
[39:49] but yet he wasn't asking me but he was
[39:53] asking the God in Me
[39:55] saying that I know something's different
[39:57] about you he knows what I believe
[39:59] but yet when they can recognize the god
[40:02] that's in you and their faith Rises up
[40:05] to say would you go pray for my son
[40:09] because I was driving down the road and
[40:11] I remembered
[40:12] it came to my memory
[40:14] of the man and his daughter was dying
[40:18] and it was the faith of the father
[40:22] that said go get Jesus
[40:25] sometimes you gotta go get Jesus
[40:30] you see they're asking go get them
[40:32] so what is it yeah
[40:34] the faith of that father for his boy
[40:37] amen
[40:39] so isn't I after
[40:42] one of our pickups we went and went to
[40:44] his house and we prayed for him and it
[40:47] was a very special time
[40:49] but yet
[40:51] let me ask you
[40:53] are you fulfilling your purpose
[40:56] does the world around you recognize why
[40:59] you're here
[41:01] it's not to glorify me
[41:03] right but yet is to glorify the god in
[41:06] you
[41:06] that everywhere you go you can say hey
[41:08] this is my purpose you talk about God
[41:10] you Fellowship
[41:12] you tell them who you are yeah
[41:15] yeah and then when there's a need they
[41:17] want to call you
[41:18] and say hey can you pray for me
[41:22] you see the world out there they
[41:24] recognize God in the need for prayer but
[41:27] they only recognize him in a time of
[41:29] need
[41:30] when there's a catastrophe
[41:32] when something major happens
[41:36] you see the other week and we all I'm
[41:38] sure we all know but
[41:40] there was that football player that got
[41:43] just an ordinary play NFL ordinary
[41:46] tackle gets hit in the chest stands up
[41:49] Falls over
[41:51] he dies right there they had to
[41:53] resuscitate him
[41:55] CPR for nine minutes on the field he's
[41:57] died twice
[42:00] but the reason I'm saying this is
[42:01] because after that happened nobody knew
[42:03] what to say
[42:04] but you know what they said let's pray
[42:06] everybody pray hey we need everybody to
[42:09] pray everybody on TV and everywhere hey
[42:12] we need to pray you pray for him and I
[42:15] believe that a hundred percent but yet
[42:17] why does it take that to call God on the
[42:19] scene
[42:20] you see even the next day they had a
[42:23] one of the ESPN guys he bowed his head
[42:26] and
[42:27] prayed right there on set he said hey
[42:29] everybody let's just pray
[42:32] I respect that man
[42:35] be it you know what would have happened
[42:36] if it was another day
[42:38] if that incident wasn't there
[42:41] he'd have been fired
[42:43] how does this make sense yeah
[42:51] and I say Lord help us you know just to
[42:54] be more sensitive
[42:56] that when somebody reaches out
[42:58] that we're not ashamed not afraid
[43:01] because you know what happens
[43:04] when somebody asks you for prayer
[43:07] a lot of times am I worthy enough to
[43:10] pray for this man
[43:12] what what happens if I go down and I
[43:14] pray for him and nothing happens and
[43:15] I'll
[43:16] you know what that's the Devil he's
[43:18] trying to suppress your faith and if he
[43:20] can suppress your faith and keep you
[43:21] down here they can keep you from
[43:23] believing in who you are and that if you
[43:25] say a prayer that God might answer it
[43:28] you see many times people will text take
[43:31] will you pray for me will you pray for
[43:32] me
[43:34] and I'm guilty of it what happens you
[43:36] get busy you forget
[43:38] yeah see what I've learned to do stop
[43:40] everything and pray
[43:43] because when you look at from a
[43:45] different purpose what if it's your per
[43:47] what if it's your prayer
[43:49] what if it's your prayer that answers
[43:51] theirs
[43:52] when you look at it from that
[43:58] your prayer might make the difference
[44:04] and I begin to continue to read
[44:10] about the blind man
[44:13] in verse 6.
[44:17] that when Jesus healed them
[44:20] I thought this was interesting
[44:23] and we when he had spaked this he spat
[44:25] on the ground
[44:26] and made clay of the spittle
[44:29] and anointed his eyes
[44:31] the eyes of the blind man
[44:34] and I thought this was interesting
[44:37] because the purpose of this man to be
[44:39] born blind
[44:41] was that God might be made manifest
[44:45] now he's gone
[44:47] so why didn't he just pray for the man
[44:49] and say young man I give you back your
[44:51] sight
[44:54] but yet he anointed his eyes
[45:01] and he told him
[45:04] something he had to do
[45:06] he had to put his faith into action
[45:09] listen in verse 7 he said unto him go
[45:12] wash in the pool of Salam
[45:15] and he went that way and washed
[45:19] and came away seeing
[45:22] you see and it hit me that God did the
[45:24] anointing
[45:25] of the eyes
[45:27] but you have to do the washing
[45:31] here you are walking in loud to see it
[45:33] with blinded eyes not knowing where
[45:35] you're going and who you are
[45:37] but yet God came by he had an
[45:39] appointment with him that day and he
[45:41] anointed your eyes
[45:43] why do you come to church you're Washed
[45:45] by the Water of the worm
[45:49] but yet God it took that man to take God
[45:52] at his word
[45:53] he had a part to do you see if that man
[45:56] never went to the pool God's purpose
[45:58] wouldn't have been made known
[46:00] right
[46:03] because God did the anointing but the
[46:05] man had to do the washing he had to put
[46:07] that into action
[46:12] you see God doesn't do
[46:15] everything as we expect he doesn't do
[46:18] everything for you sometimes
[46:21] you have to go wash you have to put it
[46:23] into action
[46:25] he'll give you a purpose
[46:28] and that purpose puts you into action
[46:33] if we can go to Second Kings 2
[46:39] ND Kings two and five
[46:42] I'll just start no so naming came to his
[46:45] horses and with his chariots and stood
[46:47] at the door
[46:49] of the House of Elisha
[46:52] and Elisha sent the messenger unto him
[46:54] saying go and wash in the Jordan seven
[46:57] times that thy flesh should come again
[47:00] to thee that thou should be clean
[47:04] and listen what Naaman did
[47:07] but Naaman was rough and went away and
[47:09] said behold I thought
[47:13] this is what I thought this is how I
[47:15] thought it should have happened
[47:21] I thought
[47:23] that the prophet would do this yeah
[47:26] I thought
[47:28] he was surely come out to me and stand
[47:30] and call on the name of the Lord and his
[47:32] his God
[47:34] his strike with his hand over the place
[47:37] and recover the leper
[47:40] you see but God don't do things as we
[47:43] thought
[47:45] in verse 12
[47:47] are not
[47:49] abana sorry
[47:54] in Far part of the rivers of Damascus
[47:56] better than all
[47:58] the Waters of Israel
[48:01] may I not wash in them and be made clean
[48:03] so he turned away and went away in Rage
[48:08] isn't that something he had an
[48:09] appointment there his healing lied right
[48:12] there
[48:13] but I thought yeah
[48:17] I thought
[48:20] you see the prophet of that day sent to
[48:23] Messenger
[48:25] to tell them exactly what the Met what
[48:28] the prophet said
[48:31] what are we doing tonight
[48:33] I'm just a messenger telling you what
[48:36] the prophet said
[48:38] to get your healing
[48:40] to get your deliverance
[48:43] but sometimes it's I thought
[48:45] it should have gone this way
[48:50] but thank God for his servant
[48:53] and his servant came near and spake unto
[48:55] him and said my father if the prophet
[48:57] had bid thee to do some great thing what
[48:59] if thou have done it how much rather
[49:02] than when he saith unto thee wash and be
[49:04] made clean sometimes it's too simple
[49:06] yeah
[49:09] yeah you see because
[49:12] that's just our Humanity
[49:15] we want to do some great big thing I'll
[49:18] go kill a giant
[49:22] go go do some great thing in front of
[49:24] the people so that they can be why
[49:26] because it begins to lift yourself up
[49:31] it takes away the glory of God
[49:36] but yet he sends you to do something so
[49:39] simple something so humble
[49:41] he makes you humble yourself
[49:44] aren't these Waters over here cleaner
[49:46] than
[49:47] that money Jordan
[49:50] but yet it's not what you thought
[49:53] it's what God told you to do
[49:58] then he went down and dipped himself
[50:00] seven times in the Jordan according
[50:03] to the saying of the man of God
[50:05] and his flesh came again unto like flesh
[50:09] of a little child and he was clean you
[50:12] see sometimes your appointment
[50:15] isn't what you want to hear
[50:20] sometimes your appointment
[50:23] is something you need to hear
[50:28] but God keeps all his appointments
[50:30] you see and there's a purpose to every
[50:32] point
[50:36] I'm reminded of the story of Saul on the
[50:39] road to Damascus we know it
[50:42] but yeah he we know that he had an
[50:43] appointment with God there
[50:47] and I just want to read verse 16.
[50:50] because the Saul was headed in One
[50:52] Direction God had an appointment to
[50:55] change it
[50:57] God had an appointment to meet him
[51:00] in verse 16
[51:02] says but arise and stand upon thy feet
[51:05] for I have appeared unto you to thee for
[51:07] this purpose
[51:09] to make the a minister and a witness
[51:11] both to these things
[51:13] which thou has seen and of those things
[51:15] which I will appear unto thee
[51:18] Verse 18 to open their eyes and to turn
[51:20] them from Darkness to light and from the
[51:23] power of Satan unto God that they may
[51:26] receive forgiveness of sin and
[51:27] inheritance among them
[51:29] which are Sanctified by the faith
[51:32] it is in me you see Saul was going in
[51:35] One Direction but God had an appointment
[51:36] with him
[51:45] see when God gives you
[51:47] when God has an appointment with you he
[51:50] gives you a purpose
[51:53] you see Mary in the Bible
[51:57] God had an appointment with her
[52:00] and according to her own understanding
[52:03] according to her own reasoning I know
[52:05] not a man
[52:07] how is this thing supposed to be
[52:10] but yet when God gives you a purpose he
[52:12] has a provided way to fulfill that
[52:14] purpose
[52:16] you see he won't leave you out there
[52:20] he imagine a young lady coming
[52:22] not married
[52:24] and saying I'm with child
[52:28] what would we think of her today
[52:31] would we doubt her
[52:33] maybe a little bit
[52:37] especially when she says oh it's from no
[52:39] man but from God
[52:43] you see but she took God at her his word
[52:49] she took God in his word your dependence
[52:52] on God's
[52:54] is what makes him God
[52:57] your dependence on him makes him Jehovah
[52:59] Jireh
[53:06] we can take Sarah
[53:10] you see Sarah had an appointment with
[53:12] God
[53:13] in the tent
[53:16] but she laughed
[53:20] because upon her own reasoning her own
[53:22] understanding she's like how
[53:25] I am a full age
[53:27] these things can't be
[53:30] but yet
[53:32] it's not our own understanding it's not
[53:34] our own reasoning
[53:37] but yet there was coming a Time
[53:40] that she would receive that word and she
[53:43] would conceive a son
[53:46] because God had that purpose that plan
[53:49] for her
[53:57] last example that I have is Esther
[54:03] you see Esther was
[54:05] to have an appointment with the King
[54:10] and when you put yourself in the story
[54:11] of Esther you have an appointment with
[54:14] almighty God
[54:16] and you have to go before the king
[54:19] but yet there's a process
[54:21] and all the women all the mains had to
[54:23] go through a purification process you
[54:25] just couldn't come off the street and go
[54:27] before the king
[54:30] so there was a process that you must go
[54:31] through but yet she had an appointment
[54:33] with that King
[54:37] you see and she was given a
[54:41] hair guy
[54:43] The Keeper of the women
[54:45] he found favor in her
[54:50] and you see that
[54:53] when she found favor in him
[54:56] haggai told her everything that the king
[54:58] liked
[55:00] everything that he wanted
[55:02] the way she should be dressed
[55:05] because all the other women
[55:07] they wanted all to find jewelry
[55:11] all the fine linen all the things that
[55:14] please are
[55:15] naturally but yet there was something
[55:18] deeper and she says
[55:22] that if I Adorn myself
[55:26] and what haggai has said
[55:28] because haggai knew what the king wanted
[55:31] he knew what he required he knew what he
[55:33] liked
[55:35] and if he came that provided way he knew
[55:38] that she would find favor
[55:43] yeah
[55:44] but yet there was a purpose
[55:50] Esther's purpose to be Queen wasn't just
[55:53] to be a queen
[55:56] she wasn't just there to be in position
[56:02] but yet she was there for a purpose
[56:06] and that purpose was for the saving of
[56:08] her people you see sometimes God puts
[56:11] you in a position
[56:13] for a purpose
[56:16] and when God puts you in a position
[56:18] there's a reason yeah
[56:20] and you have to find that reason
[56:23] you have to put it into action
[56:28] the sermonian churches he says now
[56:30] according to the word of God the bride
[56:31] was chosen before the foundation of the
[56:33] world
[56:34] this choosing of a bride was purpose in
[56:36] himself Ephesians 1 and 9 and Romans 9
[56:39] 11 says that the purpose of God
[56:42] according to election might stand
[56:46] you can't read it any other way the
[56:48] heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God
[56:50] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[56:54] and that purpose was in himself and
[56:56] being eternal
[56:58] was decreed before the foundation of the
[57:01] world
[57:04] you see just as Esther was ordained and
[57:06] she was purposed to be Queen so are you
[57:08] before the foundation of the world
[57:10] before God
[57:12] formed the Earth
[57:14] he had called you
[57:17] and that purposely dormant for so long
[57:23] that purpose lay dormant
[57:26] until it came to you
[57:29] but now you have to fulfill it
[57:37] in the sardian church age he says it was
[57:40] God's purpose to bring forth a people
[57:42] like him to himself
[57:43] that would be a word Brian
[57:46] she was chosen before the foundation of
[57:48] the world in him
[57:50] she was four known and beloved before
[57:52] she had ever brought forth during the
[57:54] ages upon the Earth
[57:57] she was Redeemed by his blood and can
[57:59] never be can come into condemnation
[58:03] she can never be in judgment because sin
[58:05] cannot be imputed unto her you never
[58:09] never did it in the first place
[58:12] you see you're choosing an election your
[58:14] call is for a purpose and it was called
[58:17] before the foundation of the world
[58:21] you see you're just living it out
[58:24] you see you're just going down through
[58:25] life and all of a sudden God come by
[58:27] your way and something struck a seed
[58:30] something came to life
[58:36] you see it's time to fulfill
[58:39] his purpose in you
[58:42] we as a body aren't complete until you
[58:44] fulfill your purpose
[58:46] and get into position
[58:55] I begin to think
[58:57] purpose of a Christian
[59:03] now the Bible says to
[59:06] visit the widows and the fatherless
[59:10] to be Christ to those around you
[59:13] and it just kind of came to me purpose
[59:18] the Bible says walk a mile in your
[59:20] brother's shoes
[59:22] go with them too
[59:24] what if you put yourself in the shoes of
[59:28] somebody fighting cancer
[59:32] what about the backward kid at school
[59:35] that always gets voted last and
[59:38] never gets picked for the team
[59:43] put your shoes in them
[59:45] young person that's trying to find their
[59:47] identity yeah
[59:52] put yourself in the shoes of a father
[59:55] and mother praying for their wayward
[59:56] child
[1:00:00] put yourself in the shoes of a family
[1:00:02] member who's maybe lost a loved one
[1:00:07] put your shoes in the
[1:00:10] Widow who's goes
[1:00:13] who goes home to an empty home at night
[1:00:16] you see whenever you begin to see these
[1:00:18] things
[1:00:19] purpose what is purpose
[1:00:23] are you reaching out to those that are
[1:00:24] hurting
[1:00:25] you see when one hurts the whole body
[1:00:28] hurts
[1:00:30] how about we be
[1:00:32] that we reach out that we be Christ to
[1:00:34] those around us yes
[1:00:37] yes you see because when you put
[1:00:38] yourself in their shoes and you begin to
[1:00:40] walk you begin to feel their pain you
[1:00:42] begin to feel their hurt what if it was
[1:00:44] you what if it was your son what if it
[1:00:46] was your daughter
[1:00:47] your father your mother
[1:00:51] you see we begin to pray a little bit
[1:00:52] different
[1:00:55] we begin to call on God a little bit
[1:00:57] different we get a little bit more
[1:00:59] Earnest when it falls in our lap
[1:01:02] yeah but the thing about it is
[1:01:06] when you found your purpose in Christ
[1:01:08] where one body
[1:01:11] we all feel the hurt we all feel the
[1:01:13] pain
[1:01:16] so I pray let let us reach out to one
[1:01:18] another
[1:01:23] God has an appointment with each one of
[1:01:25] us
[1:01:28] time and time again you'll read in the
[1:01:30] scripture for this purpose you were born
[1:01:34] yeah and for this purpose I've called
[1:01:36] you
[1:01:38] let's stand
[1:01:42] brother Branham says I know my redeemer
[1:01:44] liveth since God's purpose can never be
[1:01:47] defeated
[1:01:49] there's nothing can defeat it
[1:01:52] so happy we ought to be today resting
[1:01:54] upon the beautiful revelation of the
[1:01:56] word of the Living God that there is
[1:01:59] neither nothing present nor things to
[1:02:01] come there's no sickness no sorrow no
[1:02:03] death no Peril no no nothing can
[1:02:07] separate us from the purpose of the
[1:02:09] Living God
[1:02:10] what God has imagined in his mind God
[1:02:12] has purpose in his heart to bring it to
[1:02:15] pass there's no demon no power there's
[1:02:18] nothing can separate us from God's Great
[1:02:22] Immortal Eternal plan
[1:02:25] it must be as God has said can you say
[1:02:29] Amen
[1:02:33] God's purpose can't be defeated
[1:02:38] Satan tried to defeat it in the days of
[1:02:41] Jonah
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:47] all down through time you'll see where
[1:02:52] Satan trying to defeat that purpose
[1:02:55] but that plan is eternal
[1:02:59] that love is elective
[1:03:01] you were called your purpose was
[1:03:03] predestinated
[1:03:06] you were foreknown
[1:03:14] you see God didn't just call you to be a
[1:03:16] church member
[1:03:17] you can do that in denomination
[1:03:20] you can come to church
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:24] you can come and sit on a pew
[1:03:28] but yet God's calling us to a higher
[1:03:30] purpose
[1:03:37] see God
[1:03:38] is only going to reveal
[1:03:41] his word and that purpose through an
[1:03:43] elect lady
[1:03:46] we are the hands and feet of today
[1:03:50] come on just
[1:03:52] yes
[1:03:55] I trust each one of us will find our
[1:03:58] purpose yes
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:01] yes because I can't give it to you
[1:04:03] brother Ron can't give it to you
[1:04:06] but yet it comes down to you
[1:04:10] and when that purpose is made known to
[1:04:12] you
[1:04:13] nobody can take it away
[1:04:21] foreign
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:35] all things coming down
[1:04:39] what's happening
[1:04:41] but yet sometimes you got to get to Rock
[1:04:43] Bottom because then the only place to go
[1:04:44] is up
[1:04:47] yeah I can say that from personal
[1:04:48] experience
[1:04:51] that I found gone
[1:04:53] at a place
[1:04:55] I didn't know which way to go
[1:04:57] but yet he had an appointment with me
[1:05:01] and I can say that it wasn't
[1:05:05] in a church service so we look for it
[1:05:06] there
[1:05:08] be it sometimes God will meet you in a
[1:05:10] place
[1:05:14] maybe it's a bedroom
[1:05:17] a closet out in the woods
[1:05:23] sometimes you gotta
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:27] put God's word into action
[1:05:34] sometimes
[1:05:39] we got to get alone
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:49] that's just bow our hoods
[1:05:59] our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:06:03] Lord before the foundation of the world
[1:06:06] you formed us you knew us
[1:06:09] you have called us to be the elect Lady
[1:06:11] of this day and when we begin to
[1:06:13] recognize who we are in the positions
[1:06:15] that we have
[1:06:17] Lord the power that lays within us
[1:06:23] sometimes we doubt ourselves
[1:06:27] sometimes we don't understand
[1:06:32] but yet there's a purpose there
[1:06:37] God knows how great he is
[1:06:41] be it sometimes God wants you to realize
[1:06:43] how great you are through him
[1:06:48] father I can remember the time
[1:06:52] that I would pray and seek your face and
[1:06:54] call out to you and
[1:06:57] Lord I knew you wouldn't give up on me
[1:06:58] if I'm a son
[1:07:01] if you were a son you always will be a
[1:07:04] son
[1:07:06] and I knew you wouldn't give up on me
[1:07:08] but Lord I would pray God don't let me
[1:07:11] give up on myself
[1:07:14] let me see who I am let me
[1:07:17] let me know you in the power of your
[1:07:19] word
[1:07:20] reveal yourself to me
[1:07:23] give me a purpose give me an
[1:07:24] understanding give me a revelation I
[1:07:27] don't want my dad's religion or my
[1:07:29] grandpa's religion or brother Ron's but
[1:07:31] I want my own religion and when I came
[1:07:34] to that place I found a purpose
[1:07:38] each one of us got to come to that place
[1:07:42] that understanding that Revelation that
[1:07:44] that purpose lays with inside you
[1:07:49] and when God has an appointment with you
[1:07:52] it'll be May manifest through you
[1:07:55] and so father we just
[1:07:57] thank you for this time that you've
[1:08:00] given us to come to your house to sit at
[1:08:02] your feet Lord and I pray that just
[1:08:05] something would have been said maybe
[1:08:08] it's a little cut up and put together
[1:08:10] and
[1:08:12] sometimes you feel you're inadequate
[1:08:14] Lord too
[1:08:16] speak to your elect lady
[1:08:20] for Lord You're preparing us
[1:08:24] to meet the king
[1:08:28] and Lord circumstances and things we go
[1:08:31] through
[1:08:32] just like the blind man
[1:08:36] when you begin to understand it from
[1:08:38] that perspective
[1:08:40] Lord we begin to see that you have a
[1:08:42] purpose your hand is in it

[1:08:47] people
