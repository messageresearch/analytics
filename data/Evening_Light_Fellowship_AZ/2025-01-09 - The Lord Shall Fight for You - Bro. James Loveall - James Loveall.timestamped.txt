[36:12] year and we're already a weekend and
[36:15] time is just going to keep going by and
[36:17] you know as I begin to look and you know

[37:09] quit goals that they set it only takes
[37:12] 30 days for men and women and and
[37:16] Humanity just to quit you know what it's
[37:18] too
[37:20] hard things arise in their lives you say
[37:23] well what are you getting at that
[37:24] doesn't sound very spiritual is it how
[37:27] is it going to help me let me tell you
[37:28] it's going to let me show you in your
[37:30] human ability in your human desires and
[37:34] things when things get tough and life
[37:36] gets hard and and and struggles come up
[37:39] what happens we have a tendency to quit
[37:43] we have a tendency to lay down when the
[37:45] battle gets hard what happens we begin
[37:48] to let down
[37:52] right now as Believers we believe that
[37:55] now is the time to fight that's right
[37:58] now is the time to GD up our loins to
[38:01] get ready for the fight to to get the
[38:03] armor that God has given us because the
[38:06] enemy is going to come in like a flood
[38:09] things aren't going to get easier Saints
[38:12] though it's the Turning of a a a
[38:14] calendar year and you know Trump is
[38:16] coming in and the election and people
[38:18] think that's going that's not going
[38:19] what's going to happen it's going to get
[38:25] harder let's go back to if The Exodus
[38:29] 14 and as we pick it up here that Moses
[38:34] is called the people out or God's called
[38:35] the people out under Moses and they're
[38:37] getting into the the Wilderness here and
[38:40] let's look at verse three for Pharaoh
[38:43] will say unto the children of Israel
[38:45] they are entangled in the land and the
[38:47] Wilderness hath shut them in in verse
[38:50] four I will harden Pharaoh's heart look
[38:52] what the Lord's going to do I will
[38:54] harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall
[38:55] follow after them and I will be honored
[38:59] upon pharaoh and upon his host that the
[39:02] Egyptians may know that I am the Lord
[39:06] you see God does things he hardens
[39:08] people's hearts why not this wasn't just
[39:10] for the Israelites even though they were
[39:12] pushed out and it would caus them to
[39:14] move but what was God doing he was
[39:17] hardening Pharaoh's heart for that the
[39:20] Egyptians would know that he is
[39:22] God praise
[39:25] God in verse 10 and when Pharaoh Drew
[39:28] nigh listen to the the condition that
[39:31] the the Israelites got in that whenever
[39:33] they were delivered they were happy they
[39:35] were out in the wilderness they were out
[39:37] of
[39:38] slavery but listen in verse 10 and when
[39:40] Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel
[39:43] lifted up their voices or lifted up
[39:45] their eyes and
[39:46] behold and the Egyptians marched after
[39:49] them and they were so afraid and the
[39:52] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[39:54] and they said unto Moses because they
[39:56] were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken
[40:00] us away to die in the
[40:01] wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt
[40:04] with us to carry us forth out of
[40:07] Egypt is not this the word that we did
[40:11] tell thee in Egypt listen saying let us
[40:14] alone that we may serve the
[40:17] Egyptians for it has been better for us
[40:20] to serve the Egyptians than that we
[40:23] might die in the wilderness isn't that
[40:26] something that he here they were in
[40:28] bondage they were under
[40:30] slavery and yet they say in here it was
[40:33] better for us to live back
[40:36] there back in bondage and if we aren't
[40:39] careful what's happening in L DEA you
[40:42] get comfortable with leoa where we're at
[40:45] and I would rather live under the
[40:47] condition and be cool and and relaxed in
[40:50] my Leo Dean
[40:52] life I would rather live in
[40:55] bondage than move with the spirit of
[41:03] God in verse 13 and Moses said unto the
[41:07] people fear ye not stand still and see
[41:13] the salvation of the Lord you see when
[41:16] fear arises upon you when worry Rises
[41:19] upon you when they it feels like the
[41:21] enemy is coming in close upon you what
[41:24] is God telling them stand still that's
[41:27] right
[41:27] stand still too many we times we get
[41:30] busy in the hustle and bustle of life we
[41:33] need to stand still that's right amen
[41:36] amen for the Lord shall fight for you
[41:39] and ye shall hold your peace in verse 15
[41:42] he says and the Lord said unto
[41:45] Moses wherefore criest thou unto me
[41:49] speak unto the children of Israel that
[41:51] they may go forward let me tell you this
[41:55] evening it's time to go forward it's
[41:57] time to move forward can you receive
[42:00] that this evening it's time to move
[42:01] forward it's time to leave the past
[42:03] behind
[42:04] us absolutely it's time to leave our
[42:07] mistakes and our worries and our fears
[42:09] and everything that held us down in 2024
[42:12] is the changing of a year let us move
[42:14] forward in God praise the
[42:18] Lord I'm going to get a
[42:21] drink that one was
[42:24] opened unless they open them all
[42:36] and so we see here that we are called
[42:38] under another Exodus and leaving the
[42:40] past behind us when God you know when
[42:43] God calls us he's going to he's going to
[42:46] sustain us he's going to take care of us
[42:49] when God calls us to a battle thank you
[42:52] when God calls us to a
[42:55] battle and God said I'm going to fight
[42:58] for you let me tell you he means what he
[43:01] says and says what he means amen he's
[43:04] going to fight our
[43:09] battles and so we see as they begin to
[43:11] move on and God said I will fight for
[43:13] you hold your peace you're not going to
[43:15] have to lift a hand you're not going to
[43:17] have to lift any any sword to fight this
[43:19] enemy that's coming upon you and so we
[43:22] pick it up in verse 19 and the angel of
[43:24] the Lord went before the camp of Israel
[43:27] and removed and went behind them and the
[43:30] pillar of the cloud that went before
[43:32] their face stood behind them and it came
[43:35] between them and the Egyptians you see
[43:37] when God he's he has us on this Earthly
[43:40] Exodus and as we're walking many times
[43:43] he's providing a way before us he's
[43:45] going before us and he's opening doors
[43:47] maybe it's a job maybe it's an
[43:49] opportunity maybe it's things in our
[43:51] lives and we see God opening doors in
[43:53] our
[43:54] lives and it's God before us but then he
[43:57] removes himself and then we begin to
[43:59] walk and we stop and we say God where
[44:01] are you but yet he's just changed and
[44:04] he's come behind us because he sees when
[44:06] an enemy is coming in like a flood what
[44:08] is he going to do he's going to raise up
[44:10] a standard so when he's seeing the enemy
[44:12] coming behind him what was
[44:15] happening he moved from before him to
[44:17] behind him what is it God before us God
[44:20] behind us God above us listen God has us
[44:24] surrounded hallelujah amen thank you
[44:34] the rest of that scripture says but it
[44:35] gave light by night to
[44:38] these so that one came not near to the
[44:41] other and it was a cloud of Darkness so
[44:44] on one side
[44:46] listen the Holy Spirit the pillar that
[44:49] was moving it brought Darkness to one it
[44:51] brought judgment to one but what was it
[44:53] doing it was bringing light and Liberty
[44:55] to another praise the
[45:04] Lord and so we see
[45:08] that we can't get
[45:11] complacent we can't get lazy with the
[45:13] cares of life we got to keep moving
[45:18] forward in Deuteronomy 20 and verse
[45:24] one as we see that he he was preparing
[45:28] Israel again for battle and I love this
[45:31] story and even as you begin to read
[45:33] through the Old Testament you see that
[45:35] God he would begin to Israel is a is a
[45:37] typ host you can see it all down through
[45:39] scripture and how it types and as he
[45:42] walks Israel down he would deliver
[45:44] Israel here and they would walk a while
[45:46] and then they would have to fight
[45:47] another battle and God would deliver
[45:50] them and then they would have to fight
[45:51] another battle and so we see here in
[45:54] Deuteronomy 20 and verse one
[45:57] when thou goest out to the battle
[45:59] against thy enemies and seest horses and
[46:01] chariots and the people more than thou
[46:04] be not afraid of them for the Lord thy
[46:08] God is with thee which brought thee up
[46:11] out of the land of Egypt and it shall be
[46:15] when ye have come nigh unto the battle
[46:17] that the priest shall approach and speak
[46:19] unto the people and say unto them here
[46:22] oh Israel ye approach this day unto
[46:25] battle against your enemies enemies let
[46:28] not your hearts faint fear not do not
[46:31] tremble neither be ye terrified because
[46:34] of them for the Lord your God is he that
[46:37] goeth with you to fight for you against
[46:40] your enemies Amen to save you what is
[46:43] God doing you see he would bring a peace
[46:46] before the people a priest before the
[46:48] people and he would say prepare for
[46:50] battle what was he doing he was
[46:52] encouraging him he was getting him ready
[46:54] for battle he was making the speech and
[46:57] even as we see natural generals within
[47:00] we can look down through history Great
[47:02] Men of
[47:03] God you can see Great Men of God are
[47:06] natural men you can see Hitler and M
[47:08] musolini and they were pre-tribulation
[47:11] spirits and they could Inspire men with
[47:13] words to do things that's right yeah
[47:17] they did Inspire men with words to do
[47:20] things yeah good and bad we see men that
[47:24] would come and they would give speeches
[47:27] and and you can take George Washington I
[47:30] can only
[47:31] imagine what it would be like when he
[47:34] was at Valley Forge and he had to
[47:36] encourage the men and the men AR wearing
[47:38] shoes and they're half dressed and he
[47:40] had to prepare them for
[47:42] battle what was it
[47:46] like all these Great
[47:50] Men you can take great leaders like
[47:52] George
[47:54] Washington Grant and Lee and Eisen
[47:59] power listen to what Churchill
[48:03] said he says we shall go to the ends we
[48:06] shall fight we shall fight over the seas
[48:08] and over the oceans we shall fight with
[48:10] growing confidence and growing strength
[48:13] in the air we shall defend our Island
[48:17] whatever the cost may be we're going to
[48:19] fight on the beaches we're going to
[48:20] fight on the grounds we're going to
[48:22] fight in the fields and we're going to
[48:24] fight in the streets we're going to
[48:26] fight in the
[48:27] hills We Will Never
[48:31] Surrender and even if which I Do Not For
[48:34] a Moment believe this island or a large
[48:37] part of it would become under subjection
[48:40] or starving there's an Empire Beyond the
[48:44] Sea armed and guarded who will carry on
[48:48] the struggle until in God's good time
[48:51] the new world with all the power and
[48:54] might steps forth to rescue and bring a
[48:57] Liberation to the old you see this man
[49:00] he can get so inspired to encourage
[49:03] other men and say we're going to fight
[49:05] we're going to fight on land and we're
[49:06] going to fight in the sea we're going to
[49:08] fight and do whatever we can we're not
[49:10] going to surrender we're not going to
[49:12] give
[49:15] in and we see that he says we're going
[49:18] to fight until when until God let me
[49:20] tell you Mr Churchill God is going to
[49:23] bring a new order he's going to bring a
[49:25] new world and it's going to bring this
[49:27] world into
[49:30] subjection it's going to bring this new
[49:32] world or this old world into a
[49:34] Liberation praise the
[49:38] Lord and so we see that if men could be
[49:41] so inspired to inspire other men to
[49:44] encourage them and to use words that
[49:47] would Inspire them in such a way to go
[49:49] to battle and like I said with Hitler
[49:51] and you can go and see the concentration
[49:53] camps and I've seen them two years ago
[49:56] and you watch walk through those camps
[49:58] and you see how could men treat men like
[50:03] this how can another man treat another
[50:06] man this way and you see and you go
[50:08] through the gas Chambers and you see
[50:10] where they were burning them and you see
[50:12] pictures of bodies piled up and at the
[50:15] time that we were walking through those
[50:17] chambers it was the time that the lead
[50:20] or the the the pollen would begin to
[50:22] blow and there was white fuzz blowing
[50:24] everywhere and they would and there was
[50:26] a person there and they would say that's
[50:28] what it was like when they were burning
[50:30] them and the Ashes coming down so you
[50:33] can just imagine that a man could
[50:36] Inspire another man in such a way and if
[50:39] a man can Inspire another man how much
[50:42] more can the word of God Inspire us who
[50:45] are seeds and Sons and Daughters of God
[50:48] that it's just not a book on paper it's
[50:50] not just words that we're reading it's
[50:52] not just a just a book what is it it's
[50:55] God's eternal promise amen hallelujah
[50:59] that it should be able to inspire Us in
[51:01] such a way that when the Lord says I
[51:03] will fight your battles he's going to
[51:04] fight our battles when he says greater
[51:06] is he that is in you it's greater than
[51:09] he that is in
[51:11] you
[51:13] right it's here to encourage and to
[51:18] uplift and as we see here and I I was
[51:22] just reading in the in the Book of
[51:24] Joshua and brother Russell kind of
[51:27] mentioned it in his prayer that as we
[51:29] see in the book of Josh or in judges
[51:32] sorry in judges and when you begin to
[51:34] rej judges you you see that as they
[51:37] begin to soour through many men God
[51:41] would rise up and they would do the
[51:43] things of the Lord and then they would
[51:45] fall and they would do evil in the sight
[51:48] of God and then another man would be
[51:50] inspired and he would rise up and then
[51:52] they would do evil in the sight of God
[51:54] and so we see in Josh here here in
[51:56] judges 2 and 6 and he says and when
[52:00] Joshua had let the people go the
[52:04] children of Israel went every man unto
[52:06] his inheritance to possess the land and
[52:09] the people served the Lord all the days
[52:11] of Joshua and all the days of the elders
[52:14] that outlived Joshua who had seen all
[52:18] the great works of the Lord that he did
[52:20] for
[52:22] Israel and Joshua the son of none and
[52:24] the servant of the Lord died being being
[52:26] 110 years old and they buried him in the
[52:30] borders of his in
[52:32] inheritance in
[52:34] Timothy timoth
[52:37] heras in the Mount of
[52:39] Ephraim on the north side of the hill of
[52:41] gash and also all the generations were
[52:45] gathered unto their fathers and there
[52:47] arose another generation after them
[52:50] which knew not the Lord nor yet The
[52:53] Works which he had done for Israel
[52:58] why there was a generation that Rose
[53:00] after him there was a generation of that
[53:03] walked with Joshua and they seen the the
[53:06] the walls come down and and as Joshua
[53:08] spoke as for me and my house we're going
[53:10] to serve the Lord and I can see that he
[53:12] would Inspire those men that were around
[53:15] him he would encourage those men and
[53:17] what did he do Joshua he brought those
[53:19] men up to that
[53:21] standard yes but yet there was a
[53:24] generation after them that knew not the
[53:27] Lord or the works of the Lord and as I
[53:30] began and even brother Russell he be he
[53:32] said it there in his prayer of there's
[53:34] generation that's going on and we have
[53:36] brother Mino and different Elders within
[53:38] the church first Generations that have
[53:40] walked with the prophet they've seen the
[53:43] Miracles they've seen the signs they
[53:45] they walk through the prayer lines
[53:46] they've seen all these wonders done by
[53:48] the
[53:49] prophet and they can tell the stories of
[53:53] what it was like to be in the days of
[53:54] the Prophet right and then as a
[53:57] generation goes on and now on four
[54:00] generations my grandfather was in the
[54:02] meetings and so you see a fourth
[54:04] generation with my son there's four
[54:06] generations separating
[54:09] amen that's right and it continues onise
[54:13] God but let it not be so of any
[54:15] generation that is amongst us that we
[54:18] don't know the works of almighty god of
[54:21] what God did even within the days of our
[54:23] prophet and as I sat down with you know
[54:26] uh Brothers my age and we have young
[54:27] families and we begin to discuss what is
[54:30] it going to be like if the Lord terries
[54:32] and our kids grow up and their kids and
[54:34] now now you have this generation that
[54:37] it's you know I can go and sit down with
[54:39] my grandfather who Pro you know walked
[54:41] through the prayer lines and they can
[54:42] tell you firsthand there's nothing like
[54:45] firsthand experience there's nothing
[54:48] like it that if somebody says that I've
[54:50] been there I've seen it and they tell a
[54:53] story well now we're going to get five
[54:55] year five gener ations down the road
[54:58] what a great responsibility it is for us
[55:01] to continue the fight because what
[55:03] happened in the days of Joshua there had
[55:05] to be a generation that begin to let
[55:07] down the bar they begin to walk away
[55:09] they begin to say you know what this
[55:11] fight isn't worth
[55:14] it the stories of the Prophet they're
[55:18] old it's done in past those are days
[55:21] gone
[55:23] past but let me tell you there's still
[55:25] power in those
[55:27] stories and as I begin to pray and you
[55:30] know there's things that come to you as
[55:32] far as you know you you get a minister
[55:33] and you might tell a testimony and you
[55:35] can say well I've heard that before or
[55:37] this testimony how does that tell you
[55:39] let me tell you our Prophet told
[55:41] testimonies and I begin to listen to
[55:43] those testimonies more sincere why
[55:45] because he's telling them for a purpose
[55:47] he's trying to bring the people's Faith
[55:49] up for a purpose
[56:01] so we see the judges they would serve
[56:03] God and then they would raise up but
[56:05] then there would be a man like shamgar
[56:08] there in judges that would rise up that
[56:11] would say that the Philistines kept
[56:13] coming after him and every year he would
[56:17] plant his seeds and he would PL his
[56:18] plant his crops and he would have a
[56:20] young family and he brother brandham
[56:23] dramatizes this and he would say his
[56:25] family you know they're just they ragged
[56:27] they don't have too much to eat maybe
[56:30] the kids and his wife they don't have
[56:32] too much but he said he would put the
[56:34] you know the Harvest into the barn and
[56:36] he would store it up and he would think
[56:39] well maybe I can go buy my wife a nice
[56:40] little dress and I can do this and maybe
[56:43] buy the little kitty something and he
[56:45] says and every year the Philistines
[56:48] would
[56:48] come and they would begin to come and
[56:51] they would begin to take away everything
[56:53] that was rightfully shamgar everything
[56:55] that he worked for everything that he
[56:57] slaved for everything that he saved up
[57:00] he was saving it up for a reason why it
[57:02] was to preserve him preserve his family
[57:04] but what happened the Philistines would
[57:06] come until one day let me tell you one
[57:09] day you get fed up you get sick and
[57:12] tired of being sick and tired you get
[57:14] fed up of all this you know Satan coming
[57:17] in and trying to take away all these
[57:19] things from
[57:23] you he get sick and tired and fed up
[57:26] and one of these times you're going to
[57:28] have to stand up and fight your
[57:30] ground us Lord shamard had enough of
[57:34] it and brother Brandon would call the
[57:37] indignation of his faith would rise up
[57:40] and he went out and he slew 600
[57:41] Philistines now how does a man with an
[57:44] ox goat Slay Slay 600
[57:54] Philistines you see shamard began to
[57:56] realize who he
[57:58] was he began to realize who he was he
[58:01] was a circumcised Israelite he was a
[58:03] Seed of
[58:05] Abraham he was air to the
[58:07] promise that the promises that God made
[58:10] was still a covenant with him he began
[58:13] to realize those things that were spoken
[58:15] of of Israel in the Seed of Abraham they
[58:18] were still good for his day it wasn't
[58:20] just of the past generation it wasn't
[58:22] just of the past people that were called
[58:24] out no it's of a current gener
[58:27] generation it's of a current
[58:29] people the Covenant stands
[58:32] true and brother brandom would tell us
[58:35] that if if shamgar be in the seed Jee be
[58:38] in the Seed of Abraham how much more is
[58:41] it for the faith Seed of
[58:43] Abraham Hallelujah to claim your
[58:47] promises to claim what is rightfully
[58:49] yours
[58:56] preparation his righteous indignation
[59:02] Rose he grabbed that Ox goat and jumped
[59:05] through the window and challenged 600
[59:07] Philistines and stood there and beat
[59:09] their heads in why not a warrior not at
[59:13] all but he was an Israelite he was
[59:16] circumcised he realized who he
[59:19] was and if tonight you're circumcised
[59:22] with the Holy Ghost you don't have to
[59:24] wait until you're a trained Warrior let
[59:26] me tell you you don't have to wait till
[59:28] you know your scripture in and out you
[59:30] don't have to be able to quote all these
[59:31] quotes you don't have to do all these
[59:33] things no no no no if you're trained
[59:36] listen you don't have to wait to be
[59:38] trained just realize who you
[59:42] are Lord open our
[59:46] Father God bless your heart he said
[59:48] claim your god-given PR Privileges and
[59:51] beat their heads and amen that's right
[59:54] get out of the way Satan kick him out of
[59:56] the way I'm the guy that's taken over
[59:59] now I come in jesus' name watch him
[1:00:02] scatter brother when you use that faith
[1:00:05] on him he will back up sometimes you got
[1:00:09] to realize the faith that's in you
[1:00:11] listen it's not your dad's Faith or your
[1:00:13] parents' Faith or your pastor's Faith No
[1:00:16] it's the faith that God has given
[1:00:19] youall something's got to rise up within
[1:00:22] you
[1:00:28] each one of us has a
[1:00:30] choice which way will you choose for the
[1:00:33] men singing
[1:00:36] it we each have a choice you have to
[1:00:39] make the decision yourself it's easy
[1:00:41] whenever the kids are young you tell
[1:00:43] them brother Paul get in the car time to
[1:00:46] go to church time to do this let's have
[1:00:48] it's easy but when they come to the age
[1:00:50] of accountability that's why we got to
[1:00:52] instill in our young ones now we got to
[1:00:55] instill more we got to instill stories
[1:00:57] and things that the prophet did and what
[1:01:00] the Bible tells us yes sir
[1:01:03] why because listen that's going to be
[1:01:06] something that they can use later down
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:09] road raise up a child in the way he
[1:01:12] should go and when he is old he won't
[1:01:21] depart we all have to come the same way
[1:01:24] and I spoke on this a little bit on
[1:01:27] watch night there on free moral
[1:01:30] agency brother M mentions this 51 times
[1:01:34] you know it's good go and look through
[1:01:36] that free moral agency because you see
[1:01:39] that's the devil's bagging ground that's
[1:01:41] right you're going to find out that God
[1:01:43] uses one thing or that he allowed man to
[1:01:46] use or Satan to use one
[1:01:52] thing and he uses this free moral agency
[1:01:55] and you know I begin to look into it
[1:01:58] because I was talking with a
[1:01:59] denominational man and he began to just
[1:02:02] your conversation begins to go and then
[1:02:04] he begins to ask me do you believe in
[1:02:06] predestination yeah I do and do you
[1:02:08] believe in this yeah and then he begin
[1:02:09] to talk about you know when you begin to
[1:02:11] talk about the Bible with somebody and
[1:02:13] they're trying to testify to you I love
[1:02:15] it because they think you don't know but
[1:02:17] you do and you're just going along with
[1:02:19] it and you know I don't try in that
[1:02:21] situation to try to overtake the the
[1:02:24] conversation you know sometimes we can
[1:02:26] take that away from people somebody's
[1:02:28] trying to testify to us and tell us what
[1:02:30] God did for them and then we well let me
[1:02:32] tell you brother no let them tell you
[1:02:35] what God did for
[1:02:37] them be in ear listen to him so he began
[1:02:40] to tell me about you know his brother
[1:02:42] and he began to help his brother and he
[1:02:43] was an Army veteran and you know he
[1:02:46] began to help his brother and he began
[1:02:48] to witness to me because he was telling
[1:02:49] talking about his brother and his
[1:02:51] brother you know he had a hard life and
[1:02:53] he wasn't there cuz he was in the
[1:02:54] military and so his brother lives back
[1:02:56] east and so with his business he moved
[1:02:59] him out here and he's like I was able to
[1:03:01] you know help him out I was able to give
[1:03:03] him a place to stay and you know I was
[1:03:05] able to give him a car and I was able to
[1:03:07] provide a job and I was able to do all
[1:03:09] these things for
[1:03:10] him but yet give it a couple of
[1:03:13] months and he
[1:03:16] left and he's like and he was talking
[1:03:18] and he's trying to witness to his
[1:03:19] brother and he was like I believe in
[1:03:21] predestination and I believe that our
[1:03:23] footsteps are ordered and he kept going
[1:03:25] on about his brother but then he told
[1:03:27] he's like there's a self-choice is what
[1:03:28] he called it there's a self choice that
[1:03:31] we all have and he began to talk to me
[1:03:33] about this and I I begin to ask myself
[1:03:35] well what's different between us and
[1:03:37] denomination what's different between us
[1:03:39] and all these you know Pentecost and all
[1:03:41] these different denominations out there
[1:03:44] amen because whenever you begin to see
[1:03:47] these people are saying the same thing
[1:03:49] but there comes a point there comes a
[1:03:52] point listen that the prophet takes us
[1:03:54] so much farther we have a prophet in
[1:03:56] this day who begin to come and reveal
[1:03:58] himself in such a way he begin to show
[1:04:01] us no this is free moral agency and I
[1:04:04] can take you all the way back to Genesis
[1:04:06] back when Adam and Eve began and I can
[1:04:08] take you from there and I can take you
[1:04:10] to right now to anci individual you're
[1:04:12] based on free moral
[1:04:15] agency and the prophet of God in our Day
[1:04:18] begin to show us types and
[1:04:20] shadows he began to show us
[1:04:23] things and as I was even talking to him
[1:04:25] he began to talk about you know he he
[1:04:28] told me the Old Testament is just
[1:04:31] stories of the past it's a history book
[1:04:34] and he says you know where we begin is
[1:04:36] in in in the in the New Testament
[1:04:38] because that's where Jesus died on the
[1:04:40] cross and he rose again for our sins and
[1:04:41] that's he's like so that's what but yet
[1:04:44] we had a prophet in our day that begin
[1:04:46] to come and he begin to show us Jehovah
[1:04:48] the old is Jesus of the new what
[1:04:50] happened then is what going to happen at
[1:04:52] the
[1:04:53] end do you understand that it's God
[1:04:56] showing us and I thank God he sent us a
[1:04:59] prophet to open our eyes of
[1:05:03] understanding thank you
[1:05:07] Jesus and he showed us from Genesis to
[1:05:10] Revelations and let's read here does God
[1:05:13] change his mind he says now to be a
[1:05:17] savior there had to be something
[1:05:20] lost and God cannot purposely lose
[1:05:23] anything and then redeem it it could
[1:05:25] wouldn't be becoming to his Holiness and
[1:05:28] his great judgment but he put a man on
[1:05:30] free IM moral agency knowing that man
[1:05:32] would fall and in that then he became
[1:05:35] man himself in order to redeem back man
[1:05:39] that fell that's the reason Jesus became
[1:05:42] was Emanuel God With Us he says if God
[1:05:45] sent another person besides himself then
[1:05:48] that wouldn't be just God had to come
[1:05:51] himself and take it place and God could
[1:05:54] not come down in the spirit to take
[1:05:57] place he had to be made flesh and In the
[1:06:01] Flesh of his own creative son what was
[1:06:04] God doing his son had to come down he
[1:06:07] had to walk and he wanted to feel what
[1:06:08] it was like to be tempted to be tried he
[1:06:11] wanted to know what the pains you feel
[1:06:13] and the what you're going through when
[1:06:15] you say your heart is hurting and the
[1:06:17] different burdens that you would bear he
[1:06:19] wanted to feel the pain of
[1:06:21] those and yet his son came down and what
[1:06:24] was he put on from moral agency why
[1:06:27] because in the Garden of Eden when he
[1:06:28] came down and he he had to make a choice
[1:06:31] and he said father if it be your will
[1:06:33] let this cup pass from me listen it
[1:06:35] wasn't his will because as a man it
[1:06:38] feels that you can feel that pain you
[1:06:40] can feel that
[1:06:42] hurt but he said not my will thine be
[1:06:47] done he made a choice that affected us
[1:06:51] all he made a choice he was thinking of
[1:06:53] you and I he knew that you would be
[1:06:56] tested on freeer agency but because he
[1:06:59] overcome you can overcome
[1:07:05] also
[1:07:09] perseverance he says we have a body and
[1:07:11] our being is like a seed and he goes
[1:07:13] through the outers like a shell and then
[1:07:15] you have the pulp and inside the pulp's
[1:07:17] a germ he said that's the way the Body
[1:07:19] Soul and
[1:07:21] Spirit and we know the five senses and
[1:07:24] this five Avenues to the soul and he
[1:07:27] says inside is one what Avenue and that
[1:07:30] Avenue is the same place that God said
[1:07:33] every man from Adam and Eve self-will he
[1:07:36] says you will to live and you will to
[1:07:39] die either you want one it's your it's
[1:07:44] your basis on free moral agency and
[1:07:46] whatever a spirit that you let dominate
[1:07:49] you will bring forth the fruits your
[1:07:52] life will be dominated from the inside
[1:07:57] amen listen to that your life will be
[1:08:00] dominated by the inside it's not these
[1:08:03] outside things that are happening it's
[1:08:05] not outside things that you're allowing
[1:08:07] into your life you can say all movies
[1:08:09] you know all these you know the websites
[1:08:11] and whatever can bother you and this
[1:08:13] temptation and that Temptation no no no
[1:08:16] those are just the attributes of what's
[1:08:18] on the inside reflecting that if you're
[1:08:20] more attracted to Earthly things and
[1:08:23] worldly things it's just a reflection on
[1:08:24] what's going on on the inside you're
[1:08:26] dominated by what's on the
[1:08:29] inside it's just being made manifest
[1:08:33] very
[1:08:35] good so many people rely upon these five
[1:08:38] senses on the outside they're fine
[1:08:40] nothing against them if they agree with
[1:08:43] that six sense amen he says this Soul
[1:08:46] this Spirit only can be of two kinds one
[1:08:49] of them is the spirit of God and the
[1:08:51] other spirit is of the devil you can't
[1:08:53] serve two masters at the same same time
[1:08:56] you're either wholly given to one or
[1:08:57] wholly given to the other and if you've
[1:08:59] got the spirit of God you've got faith
[1:09:02] and you'll believe every word of God
[1:09:05] that God wrote amen amen that's
[1:09:08] right you'll believe every word that God
[1:09:11] wrote that's how you'll know what's
[1:09:12] dominating on the inside if you're
[1:09:15] attracted to the things of God if you
[1:09:17] want to be in the house of God if you
[1:09:18] want to do the things of God that's
[1:09:21] what's dominating on the inside
[1:09:27] he says you can't help being what you
[1:09:30] are even if you're a sinner you're not
[1:09:33] responsible for being a sinner you're
[1:09:36] responsible for remaining a sinner ain't
[1:09:39] that something
[1:09:43] powerful you're only responsible for
[1:09:46] remaining a sinner there's a pro there's
[1:09:48] a way provided for you but to be a
[1:09:51] sinner you was born that way God doesn't
[1:09:54] send you to hell for being a sinner God
[1:09:56] sends you to hell because you won't
[1:09:58] repent and take Christ as your savior
[1:10:00] listen to those words God isn't
[1:10:02] condemning you because you're in a state
[1:10:04] of of being a sinner no it's your choice
[1:10:08] it's your choice to remain a sinner we
[1:10:11] are all born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:10:13] come into the world speaking lies that's
[1:10:16] right that's why each one of us has to
[1:10:18] come one in the same through the basis
[1:10:20] of free moral
[1:10:22] agency true
[1:10:26] you
[1:10:27] refuse to take the right Road you send
[1:10:30] yourself to torment you send your soul
[1:10:34] to into to its Eternal destination upon
[1:10:36] free moral agency of your
[1:10:38] own convictions amen it's your own
[1:10:44] convictions let me stop there something
[1:10:48] your own
[1:10:49] convictions many times within the
[1:10:51] message we have you get people that oh
[1:10:54] this is my conviction and this my
[1:10:56] conviction be careful make sure it's
[1:10:59] based upon the word of God take it back
[1:11:02] to the word of God and if it don't line
[1:11:04] up if it don't line up with the prophet
[1:11:05] taught us listen get away with that own
[1:11:08] conviction amen because if you base
[1:11:10] things upon your own conviction and your
[1:11:12] own convictions wrong where is that
[1:11:13] going to take
[1:11:20] you God doesn't send anyone to hell he
[1:11:22] never did never will man sends
[1:11:25] themselves to hell because they refuse
[1:11:28] to accept the pride and way of Salvation
[1:11:31] he's longsuffering he doesn't want any
[1:11:34] man to perish he never wanted it he
[1:11:37] never wanted it man sends themselves to
[1:11:42] hell he has a provided way this evening
[1:11:45] if you're a sinner if your lives aren't
[1:11:47] lined up in this late hour that we are
[1:11:49] living listen time is rapidly going you
[1:11:52] don't have much time that's right you
[1:11:55] don't don't have much time amen yeah and
[1:11:59] as great and as big as God is you would
[1:12:03] think within we understand through a
[1:12:06] prophet he would do it in a certain way
[1:12:08] but thinking naturally as big and it as
[1:12:12] as God is you would think that he would
[1:12:14] create such a way that he could come and
[1:12:16] condense in down that he wouldn't allow
[1:12:18] man to
[1:12:20] fall he would have made a provided way
[1:12:22] without having men to Fall Away
[1:12:25] but yet he wanted to express his
[1:12:27] attributes he wanted to express being a
[1:12:30] savior being a Healer being a
[1:12:33] deliverer so he had to send man that way
[1:12:35] through free moral
[1:12:39] agency and this last one here and he had
[1:12:44] his heart before the
[1:12:46] foundation God had in his heart before
[1:12:48] the foundation of the world a son
[1:12:50] because he is a
[1:12:52] father but it was still in the genes of
[1:12:55] his word I think that's so powerful be
[1:12:58] it was in the genes of his
[1:13:02] word and he created a man and he put him
[1:13:06] on free moral agency but that man fell
[1:13:09] but the great sculptor God who made man
[1:13:12] from the dust of the earth he didn't
[1:13:14] settle for that he didn't settle for
[1:13:17] that he started making man again I'm so
[1:13:21] thankful tonight that he didn't settle
[1:13:22] for that he didn't settle because one
[1:13:24] man made a mistake he didn't settle
[1:13:27] because e Adam and Eve fell no no no he
[1:13:30] made it he made man in his own image but
[1:13:32] then they fell and he began right back
[1:13:35] over again thank you
[1:13:39] Lord and he made Noah and he died a
[1:13:42] drunk and he made
[1:13:45] Moses that failed to keep his
[1:13:47] word he made prophets that ran in the
[1:13:50] time of trouble and he kept building and
[1:13:53] molding until after he wanted the
[1:13:55] Masterpiece to reflect him his nature
[1:13:58] that was in his heart what a son should
[1:14:02] be you see he kept molding and he kept
[1:14:05] making and he began as I can imagine you
[1:14:07] know I don't know if you've ever been on
[1:14:10] on a wheel on a Potter's will and you
[1:14:11] begin to work with it and I did it with
[1:14:13] my wife Allison it's stressful way more
[1:14:17] stressful it's supposed to be a ni
[1:14:19] relaxing bonding
[1:14:23] time but let me tell tell
[1:14:26] you if you ever go and do it let me tell
[1:14:29] you you'll
[1:14:31] realize what happens to the clay
[1:14:34] whenever you're not under the Master's
[1:14:37] Hand because the biggest thing when you
[1:14:39] begin to mold something from the very
[1:14:42] start what do you do you plop it down
[1:14:44] right in the middle of the wheel yeah
[1:14:46] and you begin to add moisture and you
[1:14:48] begin to add moisture and you begin to
[1:14:50] make it and mold it right in the center
[1:14:51] of the wheel because if you're not in
[1:14:53] the center of the will let me tell you
[1:14:55] you as time goes on you're going to get
[1:14:56] wobbly as time goes on your Clay is
[1:14:59] going to start wobbling like this and
[1:15:00] what you do is you get in the center of
[1:15:02] the wheel and you begin to work it up
[1:15:04] and you begin to work it up and as it
[1:15:06] goes then you turn that wheel to full
[1:15:09] speed turn it to full speed because if
[1:15:12] it can't stand the test at full speed it
[1:15:14] won't stand the test at allj so you turn
[1:15:17] it to full speed and you begin to crank
[1:15:20] that thing and as long as the clay stays
[1:15:22] Center in that will you can begin to
[1:15:24] mold it
[1:15:26] you begin to mold it into whatever you
[1:15:28] want it to be but if it's not Center and
[1:15:31] if it's not in that center it's going to
[1:15:33] get wobbly like this and that's what
[1:15:35] happens and we don't want to get down in
[1:15:37] our Christian Life and we think that
[1:15:39] we're in the center of his will and we
[1:15:41] get out of position and maybe we don't
[1:15:43] have enough moisture and what happens as
[1:15:45] time goes on you begin to get wobbly and
[1:15:47] you begin to get wobbly and what what
[1:15:50] happens the Potter has to smatch it down
[1:15:53] start over yeah and that's not a fun
[1:15:56] place to be but he's going to do it he
[1:15:59] will do it he'll get you to where you
[1:16:01] need to be and I'm so thankful that it's
[1:16:03] not something let me tell you when I was
[1:16:05] molding and I kept trying and I kept
[1:16:07] trying you know what I kept doing oh
[1:16:09] Lord forgive me I'm throwing this clay
[1:16:11] away because you know what I couldn't
[1:16:13] get it but then you know the the master
[1:16:15] she came with her touch and she said
[1:16:17] listen this is what you got to do and
[1:16:18] she begin to work me and she begin to
[1:16:20] show show me exactly how it's supposed
[1:16:23] to be molded and when you get get it
[1:16:25] into the center let me tell you you can
[1:16:27] make whatever you
[1:16:29] want God and you think that as God he
[1:16:34] began to mold this masterpiece Amen on
[1:16:38] God's Great will you know what he began
[1:16:40] to do he begin to mold one character he
[1:16:43] begin to add some attributes maybe some
[1:16:45] characteristics maybe maybe he's a
[1:16:47] little strong-headed maybe he's a little
[1:16:49] this maybe he's a little that maybe he
[1:16:50] would mold this person this way and we
[1:16:52] begin to get molded and God instead of
[1:16:55] throwing the Clay Away what did he do he
[1:16:57] you know what he you take the wire and
[1:16:59] you cut it off the wheel and you set it
[1:17:01] aside you know what he was doing he says
[1:17:03] I'm going to make Noah and I'm going to
[1:17:05] mold him or he's like I'm going to make
[1:17:07] a man and I think this might be the son
[1:17:09] I might be this might be the
[1:17:10] characteristics and then he said you
[1:17:12] know what I'm just going to cut him off
[1:17:13] and I'm going to set him aside and I'm
[1:17:14] going to name him MOA Noah then he would
[1:17:17] begin to mold another characteristic and
[1:17:19] he would add things to him and add this
[1:17:21] to him and Leadership and all these
[1:17:23] things he's going to have to leave the
[1:17:25] people out of Israel and I'm going to
[1:17:26] add these things into him maybe this
[1:17:29] will be my son this is what he'll be
[1:17:31] like he said you know what that's not it
[1:17:34] that doesn't look right let me set him
[1:17:35] over here I'm going to name him Moses
[1:17:39] and he began to do that through the
[1:17:41] Bible until he
[1:17:45] came can you
[1:17:47] imagine we know the story of
[1:17:51] Michelangelo that the sculptor as he
[1:17:54] would be begin and he had that image in
[1:17:56] his mind he would begin to mold him in
[1:17:57] such a way and to save time we know that
[1:18:00] he would get to the end of his the this
[1:18:04] image he would get to the end of the
[1:18:06] image and it was in the Perfection that
[1:18:08] he had imagined in his mind it wasn't
[1:18:10] there was nothing that he had to add to
[1:18:12] or take away there was no
[1:18:14] characteristics it was just the way the
[1:18:17] Son of God was supposed to
[1:18:23] be what did he do
[1:18:25] smoted
[1:18:30] it it was such in the image that he had
[1:18:34] imagined it was so real in his mind that
[1:18:37] he wanted it to
[1:18:40] speak and he says here right in the next
[1:18:44] quote he right in the next line he says
[1:18:46] one day down on the Jordan after that
[1:18:48] Masterpiece had been molded and made
[1:18:51] here he come descending down on the
[1:18:53] wings of a dove and said that's him this
[1:18:56] is him he was so enthused with this
[1:18:59] masterpiece until he struck him on
[1:19:01] Calvary that he had to die for the rest
[1:19:03] of us that's imperfect that through the
[1:19:06] shedding of blood he might bring a many
[1:19:10] Masterpiece being a bride to his
[1:19:13] son Masterpiece scarred because of the
[1:19:16] enthusiasm of God to see such a
[1:19:20] masterpiece he struck him for all of us
[1:19:24] there he died to perfect we who are
[1:19:28] imperfect the
[1:19:31] Masterpiece hallelujah what a beautiful
[1:19:33] thing it's only by the blood that the
[1:19:36] shedding of the blood that we are able
[1:19:39] to approach the throne of God it's only
[1:19:41] by the blood that we are made whole it's
[1:19:43] only by the blood by his mercy and his
[1:19:49] grace when God said he would
[1:19:52] fight our battles
[1:19:55] am it wasn't with sword and spear amen
[1:19:59] the great General didn't he didn't come
[1:20:01] down and said oh he could have brought
[1:20:02] the whole host of the of Heaven to come
[1:20:05] down and fight for us that's
[1:20:08] right what did he
[1:20:11] do he took his only begotten son he said
[1:20:14] this is how I'm going to
[1:20:16] fight I'm not going to fight with sword
[1:20:18] and shield I'm not going to fight the
[1:20:19] way that men carnally
[1:20:22] fight I'm going to fight with Grace I'm
[1:20:25] going to fight with Mercy I'm going to
[1:20:27] fight with
[1:20:29] love I say Lord help us Lord help us
[1:20:34] listen stop fighting stop fighting
[1:20:36] amongst us stop fighting all this listen
[1:20:41] we're we're called to this battle but we
[1:20:42] fight
[1:20:44] differently you go the weapons of our
[1:20:46] our Warfare are not
[1:20:50] carnal when one offends you what do you
[1:20:53] do turn the
[1:20:55] cheek it's hard to
[1:20:58] do I say Lord help
[1:21:07] us he says I will fight for you I've
[1:21:11] already paid the price of
[1:21:15] redemption he didn't base it upon
[1:21:20] man because as we see we can look at
[1:21:23] different characters one that came to
[1:21:25] mind was
[1:21:27] Samson because Samson was raised and he
[1:21:30] have a covenant with
[1:21:31] God and we know in Samson's life he had
[1:21:36] this Covenant and he always fell back to
[1:21:38] that Covenant he always fell back to it
[1:21:42] when he would get in trouble what would
[1:21:43] he do he'd just pull out and start
[1:21:46] fighting yeah he would get caught
[1:21:50] between an army and what would he do BR
[1:21:51] get the Jawbone of an that be to
[1:21:55] fight and he began to play with his
[1:21:58] Covenant one too many
[1:22:00] times he began to play with that
[1:22:03] Covenant because God is with you let me
[1:22:06] tell you he will fight your battles he
[1:22:08] will go before you and he will protect
[1:22:10] you and when he's got a covenant with
[1:22:12] you let me tell you God always keeps his
[1:22:14] Covenant that's
[1:22:16] right and he keeps that Covenant but yet
[1:22:20] man can abuse his
[1:22:22] Covenant because he knows he began to
[1:22:25] flirt with the world he began to talk
[1:22:27] with this girl and when God came or
[1:22:29] Satan came in what did he do he fought
[1:22:31] off the the the devil there and another
[1:22:34] thing rose up and an army came against
[1:22:36] him and what did he do he would fight
[1:22:39] against
[1:22:40] it but as we watch Samson's life and we
[1:22:44] see that as Samson progressed he would
[1:22:47] begin to fight and he would be begin to
[1:22:49] fight
[1:22:51] physically But as God be would begin to
[1:22:55] Humble him and he gave up that
[1:22:58] Covenant and he would fall
[1:23:01] into
[1:23:03] slavery into bondage and he would fall
[1:23:06] into such a place that his eyes were
[1:23:08] plucked
[1:23:09] out and he became a laughing stalk and
[1:23:11] he would walk around as a mule or as an
[1:23:15] ox he came to such a
[1:23:20] place and it was
[1:23:23] one of being in a free moral
[1:23:26] agent Samson would choose to go that
[1:23:29] route Samson made choices in his life
[1:23:32] that would put him in that
[1:23:35] predicament and so we see that Samson he
[1:23:38] would fight with his physical hands but
[1:23:40] there came a place in Samson's life that
[1:23:42] he fought
[1:23:45] differently he fought differently when
[1:23:49] he would begin to feel the locks of his
[1:23:51] hair and he would reach up and he would
[1:23:53] begin to feel that strength and that
[1:23:55] Covenant come back listen he didn't have
[1:23:57] to go and beat down beat down the enemy
[1:24:00] and fight what did he say he was led by
[1:24:03] a boy to the to the to the pillars
[1:24:07] there and God used him to slay more in
[1:24:11] his death than he did his whole
[1:24:14] life many times we try to fight our
[1:24:18] battles
[1:24:20] physically many times we're trying to
[1:24:22] fight and possess in such a way
[1:24:24] but yet th this Warfare let me tell you
[1:24:28] is a is a faith
[1:24:30] warfare that's why the Bible said and we
[1:24:32] read it in the beginning fight the good
[1:24:34] fight of Faith because it is a fight of
[1:24:36] faith God is going to use your weapon of
[1:24:39] faith God is going to use the faith that
[1:24:41] you have inside of you when Giants and
[1:24:44] stuff come in your life and sicknesses
[1:24:46] listen this isn't we we're talking about
[1:24:48] shamard and he beat the devil's head and
[1:24:50] brother brandom saying beat that devil
[1:24:52] beat that deil well where's the devil
[1:24:54] and many times it's not a physical
[1:24:56] Warfare but what is it doing you're
[1:24:58] beating them with your faith that you
[1:25:00] got that you say I'm already healed by
[1:25:02] his stripes I'm Healed he's already made
[1:25:05] the Redemption he's already paid the
[1:25:08] price that's right it's not you fighting
[1:25:12] it's your faith through him and in him
[1:25:15] is what's going to beat your enemy
[1:25:17] that's right that's what's going to beat
[1:25:19] the devil
[1:25:25] it's not based upon our own
[1:25:28] ability you know uh Elementary saying is
[1:25:32] sticks and stones break my bones but
[1:25:34] words will never hurt me that is so
[1:25:37] false that is so
[1:25:39] untrue because I guarantee you you've
[1:25:41] been hurt by more by words you've been
[1:25:44] hurt more by words than somebody ever
[1:25:47] hitting you with a sticker stone or
[1:25:48] fighting you
[1:25:50] physically because our words carry power
[1:25:54] if men as I said Can Inspire other men
[1:25:57] to do such things yeah how much more
[1:26:01] does our words carry a carry a power or
[1:26:05] carry an
[1:26:08] anointing let us be careful with our
[1:26:18] words you see
[1:26:20] that's if we say words are just words
[1:26:24] then what did God used to create in the
[1:26:29] beginning if we are little
[1:26:32] gods and we
[1:26:35] say that God in the beginning created he
[1:26:38] didn't have nothing to work with but his
[1:26:41] words and when he began to speak things
[1:26:43] began to happen amen when he began to
[1:26:46] Speak Life came to pass when he began to
[1:26:49] speak things would go into orbit when he
[1:26:52] began to speak things come into order so
[1:26:54] let me say that God whenever a vessel or
[1:26:57] when a minister or a song leader or a
[1:26:59] song let me tell you words carry
[1:27:03] meanings they carry
[1:27:05] purpose they carry a power behind
[1:27:11] them 1 Timothy 6 fight the good fight of
[1:27:16] Faith it's a good fight of
[1:27:23] faith you know and as I begin to look
[1:27:25] that fighting to
[1:27:28] live is fighting to
[1:27:31] die fighting to live is fighting to die
[1:27:34] you say what do you mean by that because
[1:27:36] when you're fighting to live you're
[1:27:38] fighting to die against your own self
[1:27:40] ambition your own self- desires your own
[1:27:43] self-
[1:27:44] wants the things of this world when you
[1:27:47] become one willing to give your life for
[1:27:50] the cause of Christ that is when God can
[1:27:53] use you amen
[1:27:55] you see the greatest warriors or the
[1:27:57] greatest Fighters you can look back and
[1:27:59] men that would earn the Purple Heart or
[1:28:01] they would earn some rewards for going
[1:28:03] above and beyond why because they didn't
[1:28:05] have a fear they knew what they were
[1:28:07] fighting for they knew their purpose
[1:28:09] that was to fight was to win the to win
[1:28:11] the
[1:28:12] battle they weren't worried about dying
[1:28:15] because they knew where they were going
[1:28:16] they knew that this is my purpose on
[1:28:18] Earth is to fight this
[1:28:22] fight but yet what happened happens if
[1:28:25] you're not fully
[1:28:26] committed if you're not if you're not
[1:28:29] die hard if you're not all in let me
[1:28:31] tell you it's going to be
[1:28:39] hard brother Brandon would say in this
[1:28:42] story that was I I believe it's the
[1:28:45] power of God or I can't remember in 55
[1:28:48] but he was telling this story of a woman
[1:28:50] I want you to understand where our faith
[1:28:53] has to lie if it's a good it's a good
[1:28:55] fight of Faith this woman was at the a
[1:28:59] hotel there if I can remember right she
[1:29:01] was staying in the same Hotel of brother
[1:29:03] brandom and he as he tells it she he's
[1:29:05] walking in he hears a woman crying down
[1:29:07] in the corner and he says ma'am is
[1:29:10] everything all right can I help you and
[1:29:12] she would you know looked up and said oh
[1:29:14] brother brandom and then he's like I
[1:29:15] knew he says brother brandom I didn't
[1:29:18] get a prayer card I didn't get a prayer
[1:29:20] card and I didn't have an opportunity to
[1:29:22] come through the prayer line but I knew
[1:29:24] that if I could if we found the hotel
[1:29:27] that you were staying in and as you
[1:29:29] walked by and your Shadow would would
[1:29:31] craw come across me I knew I would be
[1:29:33] healed hallu what
[1:29:37] faith what faith and let me tell you
[1:29:40] that something so familiar because
[1:29:42] there's a woman in the Bible that knew
[1:29:44] that if she could get to Jesus if she
[1:29:46] could get to a man that that had that
[1:29:48] such power and it was
[1:29:52] God what faith did she have
[1:29:56] have and she would go on and tell them
[1:29:58] about she would go on and tell him about
[1:30:01] this you know they would they were
[1:30:02] calling him a witch and they were
[1:30:04] calling him a sorcerer they're at the
[1:30:07] meetings and brother brandom says I'm
[1:30:09] going to go to
[1:30:11] battle he says cuz the Lord fights for
[1:30:14] me amen she says brother brandom you're
[1:30:16] really going to do that you're going to
[1:30:18] call it out you're going to go after
[1:30:19] these
[1:30:20] guys and so he shows up to the meeting
[1:30:22] and as he walks in he say a I believe it
[1:30:25] was a black cod or a black something
[1:30:27] black and it was over here and it went
[1:30:29] across an audience of four or 5,000
[1:30:32] people and he says it hovered over two
[1:30:35] men he says he thought it was the
[1:30:37] because they were telling him it was the
[1:30:38] FBI they're going to come after you
[1:30:40] they're going to shut your down they're
[1:30:41] going to shut down these
[1:30:43] meetings and he says he thought it was
[1:30:45] the FBI but this this black cloud went
[1:30:47] across the audience and it landed on two
[1:30:49] men he says they were backsliding
[1:30:52] preachers
[1:30:54] they were backsliding preachers calling
[1:30:56] all this out and trying to shut it down
[1:30:58] and cause an
[1:30:59] uproar and when he got to the
[1:31:03] pulpit yes let me tell you when God
[1:31:06] stands behind you yes sir you don't have
[1:31:08] to worry that's right when God stands
[1:31:11] behind you he's going to back his
[1:31:12] servant and he called him out and he
[1:31:15] says if I'm a sorcerer and he was going
[1:31:17] to have a showdown right there on that
[1:31:19] platform he says if I'm a sorcerer you
[1:31:22] come down and stand on the platform for
[1:31:24] and if I'm not God's servant he'll smite
[1:31:26] me dead but he says if I am his servant
[1:31:29] he's going to Smite you
[1:31:30] dead and he says we'll wait we'll wait
[1:31:33] for you to come down and he says we sang
[1:31:35] A Hymn and we allowed it and we allowed
[1:31:37] 30 minutes to pass by he says them two
[1:31:40] men got up they walked over and they
[1:31:42] walked out he says they never came why
[1:31:44] because the devil don't like a showdown
[1:31:46] the devil's a bluff let me tell you when
[1:31:49] he tries to say you're not called and
[1:31:50] you're not saved and you're not healed
[1:31:52] and you can let me let me tell you
[1:31:54] something we got evidence tonight that
[1:31:57] God is the same yesterday today and
[1:31:59] forever when they came with Joshua and
[1:32:02] Joshua became and they went over and him
[1:32:04] and Caleb said we're not able to possess
[1:32:06] the land it didn't matter what they said
[1:32:09] why because they brought evidence back
[1:32:12] they brought evidence back showing this
[1:32:14] is the proof that that that land is
[1:32:16] everything that that's our
[1:32:19] inheritance praise the Lord let me tell
[1:32:21] you within this message we got ones

[1:32:32] that God has
[1:32:35] promised when he says I will fight your
[1:32:37] battles he's going to back you every
[1:32:40] time musicians
[1:32:43] come he says the power of God he said
[1:32:46] sure I said come and see the Lord in

[1:33:07] I've never seen him come to a battle in
[1:33:10] yet in what he come out packing the
[1:33:14] victory Hallelujah Lord even
[1:33:19] when when they put him in the put him in
[1:33:22] hell
