[8:54] throne knowing that you said everything
[8:57] that we have need of you've already
[9:00] provided and we're thankful for that
[9:04] Lord sometimes we don't Lord what you've
[9:07] already done and if we could just step
[9:10] into it as I was reading this
[9:12] morning and the word of the Lord came to
[9:15] Jeremiah and I remember brother Ron
[9:18] saying that means actually and the word
[9:21] of the Lord became
[9:24] Jeremiah Lord help us to become your
[9:27] word manifest it infl
[9:30] that once again you'd come down and walk
[9:32] the aisles and not just minister to us
[9:35] Lord but help us to minister one to
[9:37] another there are many needs here in
[9:40] this body
[9:41] Lord Lord but you have already provided
[9:44] and we thank you for that we thank you
[9:47] for those Lord that maybe this is their
[9:48] first time ever in this church I pray
[9:51] that they would leave realizing that
[9:53] there's something special about those
[9:55] people it's not this flesh Lord but it's
[9:58] what what's on the inside side Lord
[10:00] because you put a seed inside of there
[10:02] Lord that could be affected by your word
[10:05] and then if we would just put it in the
[10:07] right atmosphere Lord a little bit of
[10:09] water a little bit of
[10:11] sunlight that that seed would bring
[10:13] forth of its own kind Lord and Lord when
[10:16] that seed comes forth it's nothing that
[10:18] we can do to say look at what we are but
[10:21] it's something that manifest itself
[10:23] because you placed it there we thank you

[22:52] soul brother Mark forward just waiting
[22:56] on the teachers teachers okay should we
[22:59] do the vote then go ahead and do the
[23:00] vote okay all right come on up brother
[23:07] on oh I gotta go get you know what I'll
[23:10] get my microphone after this just use
[23:13] this one here amen God bless you all
[23:15] this morning I greet you in the lovely
[23:17] name of Jesus
[23:19] Christ amen um we are going to go ahead
[23:22] and take the vote now for different
[23:25] trustees and
[23:26] deacons that uh we had put into a
[23:30] position and yet we didn't vote on them
[23:33] because there's a trial period and just
[23:35] to let you know Joshua TR has been uh
[23:40] selected as and accepted or nomination
[23:44] as one of the uh trustees and so he's
[23:48] already in that acting position starting
[23:51] as of today and then we'll vote on that
[23:53] a little bit
[23:55] later but um this when you vote in a
[23:59] church just so you know it is for tithe
[24:02] paying members only if you're a visitor
[24:05] you don't have a right to vote brother
[24:07] Robert knows who pays ties and who
[24:09] doesn't
[24:11] therefore when he looks and it's going
[24:13] to be by majority vote in other words if
[24:15] it's well over 50% of the people there
[24:19] uh that vote for it and it's a vote of
[24:21] confidence now as you know you they're
[24:24] put into a trial period and remember
[24:26] that the deacons the trustees not so
[24:28] much but the deacons hold a very very
[24:32] high
[24:33] position they work in the spiritual
[24:35] matters within the church and their
[24:39] family that includes the wife and
[24:42] children okay the whole uh because how
[24:46] can a man watch over the of God if he
[24:49] can't control his own family so they're
[24:52] all held to a higher standard I want
[24:55] everyone to know who are in positions
[24:58] within our assembly that includes our M
[25:02] musicians that you're held to a higher
[25:06] standard okay and if you feel well I you
[25:10] know I just I have a hard time with that
[25:13] and and maybe uh you're vacillating with
[25:16] h some things in your life and you don't
[25:19] feel that you can do it it'd be better
[25:21] to just step down and just say hey I I
[25:23] can't because uh and when you are there
[25:28] before for the people uh the people are
[25:30] looking at you because you are are the
[25:34] standard within our
[25:36] assembly and uh so
[25:40] um let me see
[25:42] here so I think that's it brother Robert
[25:45] what we'll do uh if you would let's you
[25:48] can go ahead and okay so what we'll do
[25:50] is uh we the voot of confidence what

[40:42] we love you buddy and may you have a
[40:44] blessed birthday today with your friends
[40:46] and
[40:47] family
[40:49] amen all right let's just remain
[40:52] standing 1st Samuel 8:
[40:55] 1-10 going to take about 10 minutes
[40:58] right now and just talk to you a little
[40:59] bit and visit with you and then we're
[41:03] going to have our brother Neil is going
[41:04] to give his
[41:06] testimony 1 Samuel 8:
[41:09] 1-10 and it came to pass when was
[41:14] old that he made his sons
[41:17] judges over
[41:20] Israel now the name of his first born
[41:23] was Joel and the name of his second abah
[41:28] they were judges in
[41:30] Bersa and his sons walked not in his
[41:33] ways you might have been raised up in
[41:38] it that don't mean you walk
[41:43] it so let's
[41:46] understand this within scriptures and
[41:49] his sons walked not in his ways but
[41:53] turned aside after lucra money
[41:58] and took
[41:59] bribes and perverted
[42:02] judgment then all the Elders of Israel
[42:05] gathered themselves together and came to
[42:09] Samuel unto
[42:11] Rama and said unto him behold Thou Art
[42:15] old and thy Sons walk not thy ways now
[42:20] make us a king to judge us like all the
[42:25] nations and the thing displeased
[42:30] Samuel and when they said give us a king
[42:32] to judge us and Samuel prayed un the
[42:38] Lord the Lord said unto
[42:42] Samuel hearken unto the voice of the
[42:45] people in all that they say unto
[42:48] thee for they have not rejected
[42:52] thee but they have re
[42:55] me my
[42:58] that I should not Reign Over
[43:02] them according to all the works which
[43:05] they have done since the day that I
[43:07] brought them up out of Egypt even unto
[43:09] this day wherewith forsaken me and
[43:13] served other
[43:15] gods and so do they also unto thee now
[43:19] therefore hearken unto their voice how
[43:22] be it yet protest s unto them and show
[43:26] them the manner of the king that shall
[43:30] reign over them may God bless the
[43:32] reading of his word you may be seated
[43:34] this morning in the presence of
[43:37] God just a small thought
[43:41] here uh this morning I'd like to title
[43:44] it when the leadership
[43:48] changes when leadership
[43:52] changes and when you look at the
[43:55] scripture here we know that a Prophet is
[43:58] one that is Anointed of God give a word
[44:02] to the
[44:03] people and he is God's voice to the
[44:05] people and surely God does nothing
[44:08] except that he reveal it to his servants
[44:10] the
[44:11] prophets so
[44:13] here uh Samuel's getting
[44:19] old he's been with the people for many
[44:23] years he's been through many battles and
[44:26] he's getting old and I'm sure he's
[44:27] probably getting weary and so he now he
[44:29] said well I'll make my sons as
[44:34] judges in
[44:37] BBA and uh so as we know the
[44:41] scriptures we know that God does not
[44:45] relay or let's say take gift of the
[44:50] Prophet to place it within physical
[44:55] lineage because callings of God are even
[44:59] without
[45:00] repentance we know that and here his
[45:04] boys became
[45:06] judges but their judgment
[45:10] became a skew had a problem a little bit
[45:14] of money a little bit of
[45:16] bribery huh a little bit of turn your
[45:18] head a little bit well that's not so
[45:21] important why be so hard on the people
[45:24] make it popular I'm going to tell you s
[45:27] that the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its
[45:29] pure form is not received by popular
[45:35] majority it's not it's a straight and
[45:39] narrow
[45:42] way and so we begin to see
[45:46] that when the the Elders of Israel began
[45:51] to see that the sons are not walking
[45:53] according Samuel has preached
[45:57] so they come and they come to Samuel I
[46:00] said Samuel your sons walk not in the
[46:03] message that you preached to us see it's
[46:06] not just being raised up around
[46:10] it but it's walk the message that you've
[46:13] heard and this is extremely important
[46:17] because if you don't walk in the me the
[46:20] message what is given for your
[46:22] day if we lower the standard I ask where
[46:27] does it
[46:30] stop if we change the word of God so
[46:33] that we can be popular the Apostle Paul
[46:36] says oh I would rather have friendship
[46:39] with
[46:40] God than I would to be friend with the
[46:43] world Amen God help us to give us
[46:48] Ministries that are not here to just
[46:51] patronize you to not just sit here and
[46:55] to have a pep rally and tell you how
[46:58] predestinated and howed of God you are
[47:01] and you're chosen but you're not walking
[47:04] in the ways of
[47:08] God Amen we know that our God is a
[47:13] god of
[47:15] fire and a god of wrath and a god of
[47:18] judgment and we must fear
[47:21] God because the fear of God is the
[47:23] beginning of
[47:25] wisdom amen
[47:28] and so when leadership
[47:30] changes the course of the church the
[47:34] ways of the people
[47:35] change and the next thing you know it's
[47:38] little by
[47:39] little just a little bit of this and a
[47:42] little bit of that and pretty soon it's
[47:44] just like if I'm talking to you and I'm
[47:48] I'm visiting with you and every little
[47:50] bit I move a little bit further away
[47:52] from the pulpit pretty soon I'm way over
[47:54] here how did I get over there little
[47:56] little by
[47:58] little and so it is a little
[48:01] leaven leavens a whole lump God help us
[48:06] that we don't lower the standard but we
[48:09] hold up the standard and we say oh God
[48:11] this which was given to us by the mouth
[48:14] of Malachi 4 in this age may we hold it
[48:18] may we hold ourselves accountable you
[48:21] husbands are accountable for your you're
[48:25] accountable for your wives
[48:30] amen and so I looked in uh the seven
[48:35] Church age book a quote here um where
[48:39] brother Brenham says now I want to say
[48:41] that I believe
[48:45] leadership but it's not the leadership
[48:48] of I believe
[48:52] in wait a second clarify that you
[48:56] believe in
[48:58] leadership but I do not believe in the
[49:01] leaders of
[49:02] men I believe in the leadership of the
[49:05] Holy Ghost coming through the
[49:08] word somebody say
[49:11] amen I believe also that has set men in
[49:14] the
[49:16] church who are gifted by the
[49:20] spirit and they will keep the church in
[49:22] order
[49:25] am times you got to spank
[49:28] them sometimes you got to rebuke
[49:32] them the Bible says that a rebuke of a
[49:35] friend is better than a kiss of an
[49:41] enemy I believe also that the church is
[49:43] ruled over by that God sends to take
[49:48] charge but that rule is by the
[49:53] word so that it's not the men really
[49:57] ruing but it's the spirit of
[50:00] God for the word and the spirit are one
[50:06] for the Bible says in Hebrews 13
[50:09] and7 remember them which have the rule
[50:11] over you whose Faith
[50:14] follow who have spoken unto you the word
[50:17] of
[50:18] God considering the
[50:20] end of their conversation for we know
[50:24] that Jesus Christ
[50:27] is the
[50:33] same
[50:34] yesterday today and
[50:38] forever he does not change man changes
[50:41] people
[50:43] change but the Bible says Lord God
[50:46] changed not what God did not like in the
[50:48] Old Testament he does not like in the
[50:52] new God help
[50:55] us you
[50:57] see if we get under the wrong kind of
[51:01] headship and
[51:02] Leadership it'll take you in a wrong
[51:06] direction brother renam says and United
[51:08] under one head 1958 he says but they had
[51:12] United under the wrong
[51:15] leadership they had United under the
[51:18] leadership of man and God wants to you
[51:21] man to unite under the leadership of
[51:25] himself do you see brother R says I
[51:27] believe in leadership but not the
[51:29] leadership of man I believe in God
[51:32] sending gifts doing it's all of God he's
[51:35] the orchestrator it's him he's the
[51:41] oneall God wants us to be one he wants
[51:45] to be one with us but man wants to
[51:48] follow man give us a leader get King let
[51:52] us choose a captain and return God help
[51:55] us yes they did it in the first Exodus
[51:59] let us choose a captain let's let's get
[52:01] somebody who's popular and and and we'll
[52:04] follow him and we'll go back into the
[52:06] things that we come out of God help us
[52:10] amen I don't want to be one of those
[52:14] that's following wrong leadership do you
[52:18] God help us that's why
[52:20] I re
[52:23] prayers and I too am held accountable by
[52:26] the people people yes amen all of you
[52:29] have a right if I preach something
[52:30] that's not according to the word you
[52:32] have a right to ask
[52:34] me then I will excommunicate you from
[52:37] the church and I will
[52:41] preach come on man you know better than
[52:45] that but that happens in other places no
[52:49] I I I say and I say this humbly and not
[52:52] as a joke you do have a right because I
[52:54] am held accountable to you for what
[52:57] I that's why what I in my early Ministry
[53:02] up until now I've always showed you what
[53:04] he
[53:05] said so that you might know it's not me
[53:08] just pulling something out a a thought
[53:11] or my own opinion but to let you know
[53:14] what he God bless you all this
[53:18] morning
[53:20] um we're going to have brother Greg come
[53:24] up here and he's going to sing a song
[53:27] while he comes and gets
[53:30] ready uh I want to say just a little bit
[53:33] before brother Neil
[53:35] comes and I believe brother Neil are

[1:06:12] was a lot of work did a lot of work we
[1:06:14] had some good Fellowship during that
[1:06:16] time
[1:06:18] didn't and I want to give thanks to
[1:06:20] brother Ethan because he was very
[1:06:23] instrumental he helped me put this
[1:06:25] presentation together that was just
[1:06:28] absolutely amazing and I couldn't have
[1:06:30] done I thought I was pretty smart but
[1:06:33] boy when it comes to some of that stuff
[1:06:35] then I need some
[1:06:37] help and uh brother Paul love all I do
[1:06:39] want to recognize him too because while

[1:06:45] practically get me in the car to take me
[1:06:47] to The Men's
[1:06:48] breakfast and it was just it was just
[1:06:51] such a blessing for him and you know the
[1:06:53] things he done
[1:07:00] you know I always that the Lord waited
[1:07:03] for me to give this
[1:07:05] testimony he held off on it because he
[1:07:07] knew I had a greater testimony and one
[1:07:10] day out in the parking lot brother
[1:07:11] Robert told me remember what you told me
[1:07:14] he said brother Neil the Lord is still
[1:07:15] writing your
[1:07:17] testimony and I wow I mean he doesn't
[1:07:21] know or he knows now how much that
[1:07:23] impacted me and it's true
[1:07:26] the Lord is still writing my
[1:07:28] testimony and he's writing each and
[1:07:30] every one of ours it's not just me it's
[1:07:32] you
[1:07:34] too
[1:07:36] and it's just amazing that the goodness
[1:07:39] of God and how he is towards us even in
[1:07:42] through our worst of
[1:07:44] times and the testimony is not about
[1:07:46] anything that I have done it's not like
[1:07:48] I did
[1:07:49] this it's how the Lord kept me through
[1:07:52] all
[1:07:53] this and I see they have the title of my
[1:07:56] testimony it's called the goodness of
[1:07:59] God and though God slay me yet I will
[1:08:02] trust
[1:08:10] him and I wrote down a little note here
[1:08:13] that if I knew that this testimony was
[1:08:16] to help someone somewhere
[1:08:21] anywhere I want you to know I would do
[1:08:24] it all over you
[1:08:27] I would say Lord yeah put me through
[1:08:29] that all over again because I know it's
[1:08:30] going to help this
[1:08:32] person if we don't have that kind of a
[1:08:34] heart in it we got to re re research
[1:08:38] ourselves and boy have I in a testimony
[1:08:41] have I got something I want to tell you
[1:08:44] huge impact of what happened to me in
[1:08:45] the
[1:08:49] hospital nothing happens without the
[1:08:52] Lord's knowledge of it nothing
[1:08:55] you know maybe Satan came to the Lord
[1:08:58] and said the Lord said to Satan afflict
[1:09:00] his body that don't life that's what
[1:09:04] happened and that's how we come through
[1:09:06] it and the choices we make and how we do
[1:09:08] come through
[1:09:10] it but you know before I get into this
[1:09:14] testimony I have some things I want to
[1:09:16] share share with you from my
[1:09:23] heart and one thing I learned while I
[1:09:25] was laying in the
[1:09:27] hospital and I was laying in and I was
[1:09:29] thinking I remember a statement somebody
[1:09:31] made once it said some
[1:09:34] someone period will have first place in
[1:09:37] your
[1:09:38] life always let that sink
[1:09:42] in but your identity will always be tied
[1:09:46] whatever you give your heart
[1:09:49] to and I play there helplessness can be
[1:09:52] in the hospital and I said Lord what is
[1:09:55] my heart tied
[1:09:57] to start reevaluate my life and
[1:10:02] thinking and I made a a new commitment
[1:10:05] to the
[1:10:07] Lord and realized that Lord you weren't
[1:10:10] in my life but you are
[1:10:13] now and I'm going to step every closer
[1:10:16] every day to give this to you to come
[1:10:18] closer to
[1:10:19] you and I stand here in front of the
[1:10:21] church testifying of that today
[1:10:26] now what I want go over with you is I
[1:10:29] wanted to go back into my life a little
[1:10:31] bit before I get into this
[1:10:35] testimony and tell you how I came to the
[1:10:39] Lord and what I had to endure and I was
[1:10:42] faced with two disasters in my
[1:10:45] life choices that I made on each one of
[1:10:48] those disaster exactly leads me into
[1:10:51] where I'm at right now on this behind
[1:10:52] this Pulpit standing amen EXA
[1:10:55] exactly and you'll understand once I get
[1:10:59] done with it but I was 13 years
[1:11:02] old I I left Ohio and that's a whole
[1:11:06] testimony in its own from when I was a
[1:11:08] child to the age of
[1:11:11] 13 and one day I will give that
[1:11:13] testimony perhaps to the youth that's
[1:11:15] the one to give that testimony to the
[1:11:18] youth on March 12 2023 right brother
[1:11:21] Steve March 7th I had a aort deest
[1:11:24] section I never got to give that
[1:11:26] testimony the Lord said no we're we're
[1:11:28] going to add to it I said okay and he
[1:11:32] did he added to it I was 13 years old
[1:11:35] long story short I made it to uh come
[1:11:40] into Arizona at 13 years old in Oregon I
[1:11:43] lived in Portland
[1:11:45] Oregon and I was and I'm going to say
[1:11:48] this as nice as I possibly can I was
[1:11:50] alone I lived I would find places to
[1:11:54] stay each night through my life I'm at
[1:11:57] 13 years old you don't think that gave
[1:11:59] me complexes in my life and I won't go
[1:12:01] into details in that because this not
[1:12:03] what this is about but just know that I
[1:12:06] I was hurt and then I went to Ohio I had
[1:12:10] a bad experience with my older brother
[1:12:12] Donnie and all and and I'm going to say
[1:12:15] his name he's since passed away but the
[1:12:18] things that happened there and I won't
[1:12:20] get into those on this testimony but I
[1:12:23] could not wait he said I'm going to put
[1:12:24] you on gr on bus go to your live with
[1:12:26] your dad in Arizona and and and your
[1:12:30] stepmom and my brother he was little at
[1:12:33] the time I could not wait to get to
[1:12:36] Arizona I couldn't wait I got to
[1:12:40] Arizona and when I got off the grand bus
[1:12:44] he was in the car my other little
[1:12:46] brother was in the car and my stepmom
[1:12:48] and I was so happy I finally found a
[1:12:51] place where the Lord wanted me Arizona
[1:12:54] was my home that's where I finally
[1:12:55] realized it that Arizona was
[1:12:58] my and going through high school I
[1:13:02] lived a happy life I I I never had so
[1:13:05] much fun I made new friends and it was

[1:13:16] together I made friends we clipped dive
[1:13:19] we do all sorts of things you know and
[1:13:21] have
[1:13:23] fun and then freshman year sophomore
[1:13:26] year junior year pay a close attention
[1:13:29] because this is all leading to the
[1:13:34] end I was on my way from a history class
[1:13:36] to a physical education class just
[1:13:40] walking casually I wasn't bothered by
[1:13:42] anything I wasn't stressed I was happy
[1:13:45] and I see group of people with a guy
[1:13:47] standing up with the Bible preaching to
[1:13:49] the
[1:13:50] students now I've heard the gospel all
[1:13:52] my life as long as I can remember I've
[1:13:55] heard the salvation of
[1:13:57] Jesus I knew but it never it never
[1:14:01] quickened me
[1:14:02] never but I was by I seen a group I seen
[1:14:06] the Bible I seen him I just went around
[1:14:09] and was going back and when I came
[1:14:10] around them I heard
[1:14:14] Jesus the Lord started knocking on my
[1:14:17] heart right then instantly instantly and
[1:14:21] it stopped me in my I've heard it
[1:14:24] thousands of times
[1:14:27] and he was he was preaching on genes in
[1:14:29] Genesis the 24th chapter in front of the
[1:14:32] students and to say is the day of
[1:14:35] salvation today is the day I don't wait
[1:14:37] till
[1:14:38] tomorrow and I'm going to fast forward
[1:14:40] just a little bit but I could not wait
[1:14:43] to get home I said Lord if I can ever
[1:14:45] get home I promise I'll give my heart to
[1:14:47] you this was in high
[1:14:49] school I got
[1:14:51] home
[1:14:53] room closed the door 6:00 in the
[1:14:56] afternoon and I started
[1:14:59] praying 1 Hour 2 Hour 3 Hour 4 hour and
[1:15:04] about the fifth hour I was frustrated
[1:15:07] and I start crying and I started
[1:15:08] pounding on the bed I said I'm not leav
[1:15:11] in this room until I hear from
[1:15:13] you that's what we need to
[1:15:16] do we need to wrestle with
[1:15:20] God persevere yes and I'm telling you I
[1:15:25] there for hours and crying and pleading
[1:15:29] God nothing happened I said I'm not
[1:15:33] leaving this room until I know I've
[1:15:34] heard from you and I'm I know I'm a
[1:15:36] Christian I'm saved and I laid
[1:15:40] down and long about midnight I just got
[1:15:43] up from my knees I went over to the bed
[1:15:47] and I just laid down I was just about
[1:15:49] ready to give up I said no I'm giving up
[1:15:52] and I put my hands behind my head in a
[1:15:55] real soft voice I said please save me
[1:16:00] that was it the spirit of the Lord
[1:16:03] dropped into that room went into my
[1:16:07] heart and I'm telling you I never felt
[1:16:09] anything like it in my life I had such
[1:16:11] peace in my heart I jumped up and I
[1:16:13] started running and and I knew visited
[1:16:17] me I there's not a devil in hell could
[1:16:19] tell me I wasn't saved there's no no one
[1:16:22] that's how you need to that's how you
[1:16:24] need to persevere beer and I took that
[1:16:27] and I jumped up I remember running down
[1:16:28] the hall it was around
[1:16:30] 12:30 and I said Lord I feel so good I
[1:16:33] said I said this is wonderful and I I
[1:16:36] come back to my room I laid down and I
[1:16:39] felt this void in my heart ever so
[1:16:42] slightly void like something was
[1:16:45] missing this is where I want you to pay
[1:16:47] attention this leads into this whole
[1:16:50] testimony I said Lord what have I left
[1:16:52] undone what what is it I don't know what
[1:16:55] it
[1:16:56] is and as I as I laid
[1:17:00] there and I
[1:17:02] had this void in my heart I prayed again
[1:17:05] I started praying again I never got an
[1:17:07] answer of what that was hang on second
[1:17:10] we're GNA
[1:17:21] okay can you hear me yeah test test
[1:17:29] okay and after I gave my heart to the
[1:17:31] Lord I just I just I let that go I said
[1:17:33] well maybe someday the Lord will answer
[1:17:36] me to what this void is in my
[1:17:39] heart but as the days went on and and
[1:17:42] I'll I will try to hurry I don't I don't
[1:17:43] want to keep you too long but this is
[1:17:45] very very very important how this leads
[1:17:48] into this I
[1:17:51] was my Bible every single day I was
[1:17:55] praying and I
[1:17:56] prayed God in heaven is my witness every
[1:17:59] day I pray for knowledge and wisdom and
[1:18:02] understanding of your word I said Lord I
[1:18:04] don't know what's right out there
[1:18:05] there's so many different religions I
[1:18:06] don't know where to go what to do I said
[1:18:09] I'm alone and the the guy that I
[1:18:12] listened to led me to the Lord took me
[1:18:13] to Lake Pleasant and baptized me in the
[1:18:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[1:18:17] that's what he believed and he explained
[1:18:21] it to me I seen it instantly and that's
[1:18:23] how I was baptized
[1:18:26] and things began to start happen heart
[1:18:28] was being conditioned and I believe it
[1:18:30] was being conditioned to receive this
[1:18:33] message I went to my neighbor remember
[1:18:35] Mr Gum he lived next door I went over to
[1:18:39] him and I told him what happened and he
[1:18:42] looked at me with that deer and the
[1:18:44] headlight stare like what are you
[1:18:46] talking about you know like I I didn't I
[1:18:49] didn't understand why he looked at me
[1:18:51] like that but he said well have you
[1:18:53] thought about what you're going to do
[1:18:54] when you get out
[1:18:55] when you get out of uh School how I had
[1:18:59] a yearo I said no I can't even think
[1:19:01] about what I'm going to do
[1:19:04] tomorrow and he said well you should
[1:19:07] probably go into Bible
[1:19:10] College and I thought about it and I go
[1:19:12] well I go I I go into Bible College
[1:19:16] and you know
[1:19:18] learn
[1:19:19] preach and that's not what the Lord had
[1:19:22] planned for me but and then I started
[1:19:24] seeing that big GP in the sky you know
[1:19:26] go preach but it was go plow it
[1:19:31] wasn't it never was go preach that
[1:19:34] wasn't my calling but I learned that I
[1:19:37] learned that later and so I I called the
[1:19:42] Bible
[1:19:43] College and I made an appointment to go
[1:19:46] see him the next week that I was going
[1:19:48] to sign up for the class as I graduated
[1:19:50] I was going to go straight into
[1:19:52] Bible and when I H up the phone from him
[1:19:55] I had my
[1:19:56] appointment conviction start setting in
[1:19:59] I couldn't understand what in the world
[1:20:01] is going on why do I feel so convicted
[1:20:03] and as got closer and closer and closer
[1:20:06] and closer to the to this time of going
[1:20:08] to Bible College the conviction got
[1:20:10] worse I thought Lord did I do something
[1:20:12] wrong or maybe it's the devil that
[1:20:14] doesn't want me to do this you know
[1:20:16] maybe that's what it is so anyway I got
[1:20:19] in the car and I drove up there for my
[1:20:21] appointment I couldn't get out of
[1:20:22] the I couldn't open the door I started
[1:20:25] crying I started weeping in the car I
[1:20:27] said I don't understand this I said I
[1:20:30] can't do it so I took that and I put it
[1:20:32] on the Shelf I said maybe it's for
[1:20:34] another day so I left it alone things
[1:20:38] like that began to happen and I could
[1:20:39] say tell you a hundred things that had
[1:20:42] happened to condition me for where I'm
[1:20:44] at
[1:20:46] today one of
[1:20:48] them one time I I worked while I was in
[1:20:51] high school I worked for a small company
[1:20:53] I was hanging lights in the back of of a
[1:20:57] delivering them of a Catholic
[1:21:00] church and I was walking similar
[1:21:03] experience you had brother Ron but I was
[1:21:05] a Christian now and I knew the Lord was
[1:21:08] dealing with my hearts carried some
[1:21:11] equipment through the sanctuary into the
[1:21:13] back Annex because of construction we
[1:21:15] couldn't drive around to the annex and I
[1:21:17] went through and I dropped off the
[1:21:20] equipment and I was coming back through
[1:21:22] and I walked to the sanctuary and like
[1:21:25] this I go wow I wondered with great ad
[1:21:28] like John I seen purple and Scarlet and
[1:21:31] gold and candles and and statues
[1:21:34] everything just everywhere I go wow look
[1:21:37] at this stained glass look at this is
[1:21:39] beautiful look at this and I just kept
[1:21:42] going walking out and I noticed on the
[1:21:43] wall like like brother Ron there was a
[1:21:45] big Virgin
[1:21:47] Mary and I walked over there and I go
[1:21:50] what is that I said there's there's a
[1:21:53] bowl under it this almost similar what
[1:21:55] brother Ron went through I walked up to
[1:21:57] the Bowl go what is that is there
[1:22:00] something in it and it was water I go
[1:22:03] that's holy water that well I didn't see
[1:22:05] any holes in it
[1:22:08] but but I I I to
[1:22:13] it and I put my finger in it and I go
[1:22:15] how do they do that and I this this God
[1:22:19] is my witness before I stand to you
[1:22:21] today I put my fingers in and and I went
[1:22:24] like this I when I did a tsunami of
[1:22:28] conviction hit me so hard it almost
[1:22:30] knocked me
[1:22:31] over and I said and I I whoa I I what
[1:22:36] did I do wrong what did I do wrong I
[1:22:38] couldn't get I couldn't get away from it
[1:22:41] man I got out of there so quick I never
[1:22:43] went back I said I never want to go in
[1:22:46] there again I don't know what this is I
[1:22:47] didn't know what it was till years years
[1:22:50] years
[1:22:52] later and
[1:22:58] so I after that many many different
[1:23:01] things start
[1:23:02] happening I went to a preacher one time
[1:23:05] the guy that led me to the Lord we went
[1:23:07] to some Revival somewhere I don't know
[1:23:10] and the prayer line at the end and when
[1:23:13] I got to the preacher he looked at me I
[1:23:16] don't even know who he was he said you
[1:23:18] carry a burden a heavy
[1:23:21] burden I said yeah
[1:23:24] you know because of my P because of my
[1:23:27] childhood and he said is it me is there
[1:23:30] there's something wrong he says is it me
[1:23:32] I said no it's not you but what he was
[1:23:36] preaching was good but it just didn't
[1:23:39] line up with what I was reading in and
[1:23:42] and I did I couldn't understand I go why
[1:23:44] Lord why is this happening to me I don't
[1:23:46] understand why this is happening
[1:23:48] me and
[1:23:50] then then one day
[1:23:56] I was on my way I was at
[1:24:00] home and this is the most I'm going to
[1:24:02] call this the most precious moment of my
[1:24:05] life today it's the most precious moment
[1:24:08] and this is what I want I was going to
[1:24:10] tell the youth and now I get to tell it
[1:24:12] to everybody and I want you to listen
[1:24:15] closely to this brother Steve you
[1:24:17] remember the story I told
[1:24:19] you I would I was sitting at home I was
[1:24:22] reading my Bible my brother calls me he
[1:24:24] had married and he had two little girls
[1:24:27] him and his wife he said can you come
[1:24:29] over and watch the girls while I go me
[1:24:32] and April his was his wife go grocery
[1:24:35] shopping I said well
[1:24:36] sure so I went over there I took my
[1:24:39] Bible and they went and I sat down the
[1:24:42] girls were sleeping and I was reading my
[1:24:44] Bible and on his wall he had a
[1:24:49] crucifix big crucifix about this big
[1:24:51] about this why and he had the Lord on it
[1:24:55] this is going to sound silly but
[1:24:58] listen the nail in the right arm came
[1:25:01] off and the nail and the legs came off
[1:25:04] and the Lord was hanging by one arm and
[1:25:08] he had it and I had seen it before and I
[1:25:09] said fix that thing don't let the Lord
[1:25:12] hang like that I know it sounds silly
[1:25:15] and he said he said we I'll get it well
[1:25:17] now I sit and read my Bible kept looking
[1:25:20] up at this and I go I go I can't I can't
[1:25:22] do this I said I can't sit there
[1:25:24] watching this thing like this but watch
[1:25:26] how the Lord was in
[1:25:28] it I go I got to fix
[1:25:31] it I got up and I took the cross Off the
[1:25:34] Wall put it down on the table and I got
[1:25:37] I started examining
[1:25:38] it and there was a brass nail in the
[1:25:42] wrist and one in the
[1:25:44] legs and I thought well if I slide it
[1:25:47] over then I can probably get another
[1:25:49] piece of wood in there I could I could
[1:25:51] put it in there and I went in and I got
[1:25:54] a butter knife out of the kitchen I laid
[1:25:56] the Lord on the cross and I lined him up
[1:25:58] just right and I put the cross in there
[1:26:00] and
[1:26:01] I and I
[1:26:04] stopped all of a sudden that butter
[1:26:06] knife turned into a
[1:26:08] big and that nail turned into a big
[1:26:11] spike and I was
[1:26:15] going and I start
[1:26:17] crying and I went like
[1:26:20] this and the tears were dripping down on
[1:26:23] the cross
[1:26:26] and I
[1:26:26] said that's right my sins put you there
[1:26:30] it was a moment that can't even explain
[1:26:34] to
[1:26:35] you but I looked down
[1:26:38] there and I was crying and sobbing and
[1:26:42] that void in my heart that I had from
[1:26:44] when I to the Lord I knew was tied to
[1:26:47] that cross now I
[1:26:49] knew I go there's something that this
[1:26:52] void is is is speak speaking out to
[1:26:57] me I took the Lord off the cross I hung
[1:27:00] an empty cross on the wall my brother
[1:27:02] came home he looks and he he goes
[1:27:04] where's
[1:27:07] Jesus he looks at the cross I go he's
[1:27:10] not on the cross
[1:27:12] anymore and he goes what's wrong with
[1:27:15] you
[1:27:16] nothing and I walked and and I left and
[1:27:19] that moment has never left me but it's
[1:27:22] it's it was the most precious moment
[1:27:24] moment that I ever had to experience and
[1:27:26] I knew was it but
[1:27:33] now now I lived a couple a few months
[1:27:37] went by and I worked at a little Phoenix
[1:27:39] a little sheet metal shop and I was in
[1:27:42] there and this is how I came to the
[1:27:43] message I read my Bible and prayed every
[1:27:46] day and I was in the sheet metal shop
[1:27:50] and we had a start his name was brother
[1:27:52] Wayne ghaw and I want to mention in his
[1:27:54] name cuz he since passed away and and
[1:27:58] open he he's looking over the banister
[1:28:02] at me
[1:28:04] right and he he he was reading the Bible
[1:28:08] and I approached him I said oh you're
[1:28:09] reading the Bible he goes yeah I said
[1:28:12] well I'm I'm a Christian too so we'd
[1:28:14] spend the afternoons and we'd have
[1:28:15] little Bible studies together then one
[1:28:17] day I walked up to any he was reading a
[1:28:19] message
[1:28:20] book it was uh testimony on the sea I go
[1:28:24] what are you reading he goes oh it's a
[1:28:26] message from brother brandom I go who's
[1:28:28] brother
[1:28:29] brandham and he told me he said well he
[1:28:32] was a prophet and he gave me scriptures
[1:28:33] and everything
[1:28:34] and and my heart was like now I had the
[1:28:38] opposite of the
[1:28:41] feeling now I had I the Lord was saying
[1:28:44] you look into this it was complete
[1:28:47] opposite I can't explain the feeling but
[1:28:49] I knew something was tugging at me for
[1:28:51] this and he told me he gave me a book
[1:28:54] William brandom a man set from God and
[1:28:56] my uh my grandson Pierce actually I see
[1:28:59] him sitting back there Pierce and he
[1:29:03] read the same book just just the other
[1:29:05] day I'm going to tell you about him the
[1:29:08] other day I finished that book he gave
[1:29:11] me a tape God explain William brandham
[1:29:14] sent Manet from God and he gave me all
[1:29:16] the scriptures so I went
[1:29:19] home I read the book probably all in one
[1:29:22] sitting I listened to the tape and my
[1:29:25] heart I was about ready to run I
[1:29:27] couldn't and I told him Wayne before I
[1:29:30] left I said if this is true I said God
[1:29:33] will show me in this Bible that what
[1:29:35] you're saying is correct I said I knew
[1:29:37] from my past experience that this he'll
[1:29:40] show me and I went home I shut myself in
[1:29:43] a room again and I'm sitting
[1:29:49] room and I'm praying I listen read that
[1:29:52] book I listen to that tape
[1:29:55] and I I said okay now it's got to be in
[1:29:57] the word I got to check it with the word
[1:29:59] I opened up my Bible I read Genesis the
[1:30:02] 24th chapter first thing I
[1:30:06] read and I go oh my it's just getting
[1:30:10] this is building up inside of me I read
[1:30:12] Amos
[1:30:13] 3:7 I read M 4 5 and 6 now I'm about
[1:30:17] ready to just you know
[1:30:19] Skyrocket and then I read Luke 17:30 and
[1:30:23] revelation 7 that was that did it for me
[1:30:26] that was it I was done and I I jumped up
[1:30:29] off the bed and I pointed my finger God
[1:30:31] is my witness and I said what I've been
[1:30:34] looking for my whole life that's it I
[1:30:37] knew
[1:30:37] it I knew beyond a shell of a doubt and
[1:30:40] when I said that it felt like a fire
[1:30:43] brand came out of the fire and went
[1:30:46] straight in my heart it was burned in me
[1:30:49] for the rest of my life I knew
[1:30:52] it and you you can't take you can't like
[1:30:55] brother Michael Patterson
[1:30:57] said right a revelation is not a
[1:30:59] revelation if you can be talked out of
[1:31:02] it that's exactly
[1:31:06] right and I went on from
[1:31:09] there and I was just I was just I was
[1:31:13] just ate up the the the messages and the
[1:31:15] tapes reading my Bible and praying and I
[1:31:18] was just I was climing it was good and I
[1:31:21] start church with him and we we were
[1:31:24] going to church and we had such a
[1:31:26] wonderful time in service
[1:31:28] and now the other part of the Void
[1:31:31] remember I still had that void in me now
[1:31:33] listen and then I'll lead into my
[1:31:35] presentation you'll understand
[1:31:37] it but I
[1:31:41] was going to church with him brother La
[1:31:44] Fontaine John La Fontaine and I told him
[1:31:47] this testimony when he was here when we
[1:31:50] were back on Maryland I remember him
[1:31:51] being here and he was preaching a three-
[1:31:55] night service in
[1:31:56] church and he preached a sermon called a
[1:31:59] love
[1:32:00] story he preached on the
[1:32:05] crucifixion and he used his son for an
[1:32:08] illustration he brought him on stage and
[1:32:10] he laid him down and he come across like
[1:32:12] the crucifixion he was coming down and I
[1:32:14] was sitting sister Sandy
[1:32:17] is and I lost it I said that's I went
[1:32:23] from there to the to to there to the I
[1:32:27] never touched the ground I don't think
[1:32:30] and I hit that Altar and I prayed and I
[1:32:33] cried for three days I stay I sobbed the
[1:32:37] whole world left there was nobody around
[1:32:39] me there was nothing at all hindering my
[1:32:43] hindering me I just cried and repented
[1:32:47] that's what was missing in my life that
[1:32:49] was the void I go I came to you I gave
[1:32:52] you my heart I I repented I asked you to
[1:32:55] come into my heart but I never really
[1:32:57] poured out my soul to the cross of
[1:33:01] Calvary I never
[1:33:02] did that
[1:33:07] day and I'm asking anybody that's young
[1:33:10] people here or somebody that you might
[1:33:12] be struggling you might have that void
[1:33:14] in your heart I don't know what's
[1:33:17] missing in your life is that what you
[1:33:20] need with God and there there's the
[1:33:24] answer right there it's not out there
[1:33:26] and walking out in the world and doing
[1:33:28] things it's it's turn the other way and
[1:33:31] come to
[1:33:32] Christ and really pour out your heart
[1:33:35] and give your heart to him that's what
[1:33:38] changed
[1:33:46] me
[1:33:49] now this next
[1:33:52] part is the part I don't like to tell
[1:33:54] but I have to because in a testimony you
[1:33:57] have to tell the bad with the
[1:34:02] good time went on I got a job at AIR
[1:34:06] research which is now Honeywell that's a
[1:34:08] whole don't don't want to go through all
[1:34:10] the name changes but I was
[1:34:14] working and while I was
[1:34:19] working something came over me and said
[1:34:21] something wrong
[1:34:24] and I
[1:34:26] was
[1:34:28] working and I remember listening I was
[1:34:30] listening to the Marin out the singers
[1:34:32] while I was at work and I
[1:34:35] stopped and I go what's wrong
[1:34:37] something's wrong and I don't know what
[1:34:38] it
[1:34:39] is and I looked over at we have these
[1:34:42] lights when the phone rings it'll
[1:34:43] pulsate if it's an outside call and if
[1:34:46] it's an inside call it'll just stay
[1:34:47] solid and I looked over and it was
[1:34:50] pulsating and I go something's wrong
[1:34:52] that's for me I know it
[1:34:54] is and then Aaron answered the phone A
[1:34:56] friend of mine Neil telephone and I just
[1:35:01] I I couldn't take it I went over to the
[1:35:05] phone and they said you got to get home
[1:35:06] real quick I can't tell you what
[1:35:09] happened I'm sorry but I was faced with
[1:35:12] a disaster in my life that just
[1:35:15] isting this is where it leads into where
[1:35:18] I'm at
[1:35:19] today I went I went home I was face with
[1:35:23] the disaster they say I had a nervous
[1:35:27] breakdown life kept slipping
[1:35:30] away

[1:35:42] much brother Steve I'm going to use your
[1:35:45] illustration I stopped reading my Bible

[1:35:58] much then I start reading my Bible at
[1:36:01] all I said forget it I'm not reading
[1:36:02] anymore and I'm
[1:36:09] anymore then I stopped going to church

[1:36:29] Lord I couldn't get
[1:36:33] back I was out in the world and I said
[1:36:36] Lord where are you it was too
[1:36:39] late it had went too far sin will take
[1:36:43] you farther than you want to go and keep
[1:36:45] you longer than you want to stay let me
[1:36:47] tell you it's
[1:36:49] true and I said
[1:36:51] Lord I don't know how to get back I'm
[1:36:53] too far gone during that
[1:36:56] time several years several several years
[1:36:59] and I I can't get into that part of it
[1:37:01] but know this it was
[1:37:05] hard the ways of it it's just hard the
[1:37:10] scripture the ways of a transgressor is
[1:37:14] hard and I suffered deeply and
[1:37:18] greatly and then I
[1:37:21] finally and I'm on a fast forward and
[1:37:23] bypass a lot of it which I will give it
[1:37:25] in a testimony someday what happened
[1:37:28] during those years just that
[1:37:31] time but I
[1:37:33] was coming back I had reached the end I
[1:37:38] said Lord I can't take anymore now I've
[1:37:41] hit rock
[1:37:42] bottom now I'm at Rock
[1:37:44] Bottom my heart to the Lord I wasn't at
[1:37:47] Rock
[1:37:48] botom but now I
[1:37:50] am and if I oh if I could tell you what
[1:37:53] happened during those times it seemed
[1:37:55] like no matter where I was wor places I
[1:37:58] could ever be the spirit of L the spirit
[1:38:01] of the Lord would come close to me and
[1:38:03] I'd feel him and I go why here Lord why
[1:38:07] here I said I I'm sitting in this bar or
[1:38:10] whatever and I said and I can feel your
[1:38:12] presence why
[1:38:15] here what's the scripture David though I
[1:38:19] make my bed in hell thou art with me
[1:38:23] thou art
[1:38:24] there and I didn't understand that till
[1:38:27] later but he was there watching over me
[1:38:30] the whole time in spite of
[1:38:32] myself Lord was there watching over me
[1:38:35] because I gave my heart to the Lord he's
[1:38:37] not going to lead me nor forsake
[1:38:38] me he's not going to do that to any of
[1:38:42] us and I finally reached it and I said
[1:38:45] you know what I'm going to get in my
[1:38:46] truck and I'm going to go as fast as I
[1:38:48] can and run it into a wall and I'm
[1:38:51] done a lot of these things nobody even
[1:38:54] knows about I'm saying it for the first
[1:38:55] time in my
[1:38:58] life and when I I got in
[1:39:01] there I was in my my truck and I bowed
[1:39:04] my
[1:39:06] head and I hadn't prayed in a long time
[1:39:08] I said Lord I'm done I'm hit rock bottom
[1:39:11] and this is how I spoke I said Lord I'm
[1:39:12] at Rock Bottom there's no other way to
[1:39:15] go and a voice spoke and said there's
[1:39:17] up brother Jesse remember you told me
[1:39:20] the other day about that
[1:39:22] voice and it said there's up and I
[1:39:25] looked at my head I go what was that I
[1:39:27] didn't know where it was coming from it
[1:39:29] was me inside but it just as plain and
[1:39:32] sweet as you heard my boy there's
[1:39:34] up and I said
[1:39:39] well and I want to read a scripture in
[1:39:42] Hebrews 11 do you have that scripture
[1:39:44] brother I I don't remember where I put
[1:39:49] it now follow along this is what came to
[1:39:52] my mind while I'm in my V
[1:39:54] man it says and others had Trials of
[1:39:56] cruel Mo and
[1:39:59] scourgings and moreover of bonds of
[1:40:01] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:40:03] saw a thunder they were tempted they
[1:40:05] were slain with the sword they wandered
[1:40:07] about in sheep's clo sheep sheep's goats
[1:40:10] being destitute and Afflicted tormented
[1:40:13] of whom the world was not worthy they
[1:40:16] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:40:18] in dens and caves of the
[1:40:20] earth and these all all and these all PA
[1:40:23] having obtained a good report through
[1:40:25] the received not
[1:40:28] the god having provided some better
[1:40:31] thing for
[1:40:33] us that without us should not be made
[1:40:37] perfect that came to my heart while I
[1:40:39] was sitting in the van that exact
[1:40:42] scripture and I said Lord I failed
[1:40:45] them I said I
[1:40:49] failed I said look what they went
[1:40:51] through I wasn't cut up and tortured and
[1:40:53] tormented and throwing on a rack of
[1:40:55] nails or whatever and cut I said I I
[1:40:59] said
[1:41:01] I'm I
[1:41:04] failed and each day I said Lord I
[1:41:07] promise and I made a promise I said I
[1:41:09] don't care how long it takes each day

[1:47:34] timeline I'm G leave that picture up
[1:47:36] there for a
[1:47:37] minute this is the time March 7th
[1:47:42] 2023 I was getting ready for
[1:47:45] work 20 in the morning was brushing my
[1:47:49] teeth and it felt like a sword struck me
[1:47:51] in the back
[1:47:54] I staggered to the living
[1:47:56] room where
[1:47:59] I my wife was trying to dial
[1:48:02] 911 we were have a hard time getting the
[1:48:05] connection couldn't do
[1:48:08] it I'm barely hearing things end up
[1:48:11] using my phone remember the clock is
[1:48:16] ticking 15 minutes passed before the
[1:48:18] paramedics arrived once you got a hold
[1:48:20] of
[1:48:21] them par paramedics worked on me for 15
[1:48:26] minutes I was taken to delw our
[1:48:28] approximately 15minute
[1:48:31] Drive emergency treated my a condition
[1:48:34] like it was a heart attack big mistake
[1:48:37] right off the right off the get-go they
[1:48:40] had no idea it was an aortic
[1:48:43] dissection an angiogram was performed it
[1:48:46] was then the doctors realized there's
[1:48:48] nothing wrong with his heart it's his
[1:48:51] aorta it was dissecting
[1:48:54] flown to Boswell after about an hour of
[1:48:57] doctor's
[1:48:58] diagnosis and keep in mind this time
[1:49:02] zone this time that's
[1:49:04] ticking flown to
[1:49:08] Boswell 9:30
[1:49:10] a.m. they I was at I was at um Boswell
[1:49:15] finally 9:30 they're prepping me for
[1:49:17] surgery so from 5:30 to 9:30 has already
[1:49:21] gone by and I'm still being prepped for
[1:49:23] surgery I should have been dead right
[1:49:25] then I was dead you only have five
[1:49:28] minutes at the most maybe an hour and
[1:49:30] I'm going to read that to you in a
[1:49:37] minute car Caren my wife she Karen met a
[1:49:40] lady in the waiting
[1:49:42] room and found her husband was scheduled
[1:49:45] to have surgery that
[1:49:47] day Dr Savage asked a husband if he
[1:49:50] could postpone his surgery
[1:49:53] to do mine that if he didn't perform the
[1:49:56] the surgery I was going to
[1:49:58] die the husband said told the doctor go
[1:50:00] save his
[1:50:03] life I was in surgery for 11 hours many
[1:50:07] complications occurred after Opera
[1:50:10] operation my kidney my livers immediate
[1:50:13] my liver immediately stopped working and
[1:50:17] was on my and was on dialysis for three
[1:50:20] months which they said I would never
[1:50:23] ever
[1:50:24] again for each day I was on dialysis the
[1:50:27] doctor said I would never get off
[1:50:30] dialysis my liver wasn't working my
[1:50:33] throat was damaged from the the tube
[1:50:36] they put down there because it was
[1:50:37] bigger than it was supposed to be and
[1:50:39] they
[1:50:40] damag my throat I had to be fed through
[1:50:43] my nose I ended up getting pneumonia and
[1:50:46] aspirating and then my hands my feet
[1:50:49] start
[1:50:51] swelling now I'm going to go over a
[1:50:53] little bit about what aortic dissection
[1:50:55] is because a lot of people don't
[1:50:59] know where is that that
[1:51:03] screen
[1:51:12] oh oh okay there it is I'm going to read
[1:51:15] it from here
[1:51:18] um so remember the time
[1:51:23] what is an aortic dissection it's a tear
[1:51:25] in the inner layer of the large vessel
[1:51:27] the aorta wrenching off the heart an
[1:51:30] aortic dissection is a medical
[1:51:32] emergency in which the inner layer of
[1:51:35] the aorta tears it's most common in men
[1:51:39] in their 60s and 70s symptoms include
[1:51:42] sudden severe chest pain and upper back
[1:51:44] pain that radi to the neck or down the
[1:51:47] back loss of consciousness and shortness
[1:51:50] of
[1:51:51] breath one of the causes is high blood
[1:51:58] pressure now I'm going to go back and if
[1:52:00] you can see this I just show this real
[1:52:02] quick but you can see the and a little
[1:52:05] tear and how it starts dissecting it
[1:52:07] bubbles out and starts
[1:52:13] dissecting further explanation the loss
[1:52:15] of blood flow caused by a leaky aorta
[1:52:18] means there's less oxygen for the vital
[1:52:20] organs like the brain and even the heart
[1:52:24] which can be deadly as many as 40% of
[1:52:27] people who suffer aortic dissection die
[1:52:32] instantly and the risk death increases 3
[1:52:36] to% every hour the condition is left
[1:52:39] untreated Remember the Time Zone from
[1:52:42] 5:30 to even before I got into surgery
[1:52:45] the time is
[1:52:48] ticking but that's not all
[1:52:53] 5 minutes to an hour is crucial time to
[1:52:55] reach hospital and rush into surgery
[1:52:57] once the onset begins people who have an
[1:53:00] acute aortic dissection have a high
[1:53:02] death rate an average of 15 to 30% of
[1:53:06] people die after reaching the emergency
[1:53:09] room even after so now it's even getting
[1:53:12] worse so even if I make it there and get
[1:53:16] surgery I'm going to I'm you
[1:53:20] know now trash foot you've heard that
[1:53:23] term I think brother Ron has mentioned
[1:53:24] it trash foot is caused from a a section
[1:53:29] surgery so listen an acute limb aeia
[1:53:32] which is a lack of oxygen following an
[1:53:34] aortic surgery is commonly termed as
[1:53:37] trash foot a restriction in apply to any
[1:53:41] tissue muscle group or organ the body
[1:53:44] causing shortness of oxygen that is
[1:53:46] needful for cellular cellular metabolism
[1:53:49] which is to keep the tissue
[1:53:51] alive now trash foot alone the onset of
[1:53:54] that there is no cure for it the disease
[1:53:57] and the treatment mly supportive the
[1:54:00] prognosis of this condition is poor with
[1:54:03] a mortality rate of 72 to
[1:54:06] 80% so even if you've had you survive
[1:54:09] this
[1:54:10] far and you're going to get a you're
[1:54:13] going to get trash foot from the aortic
[1:54:16] having aortic dissecting your chances
[1:54:19] are you're gone from that 80%
[1:54:24] because that stuff's got to go somewhere
[1:54:25] they don't know what to do with it
[1:54:28] there's no cure for the disease and the
[1:54:29] treatment is mainly supportive the
[1:54:32] prognosis of the condition is poor the
[1:54:34] mortality rate of 72 or 80% a mortality
[1:54:38] rate refers to the percentage of people
[1:54:41] who die in a given scenario High
[1:54:43] mortality rate signifies a lot of
[1:54:46] people am I a miracle
[1:54:50] standing yes I am by me no god holds
[1:54:55] Life In His Hands he's a giver and taker
[1:54:58] of life and I was kept alive for a
[1:55:04] reason can read it I couldn't those
[1:55:07] words but but I I think I I think I I I
[1:55:10] can now so I don't have to turn
[1:55:16] around I read that that was the timeline
[1:55:19] so
[1:55:24] that's right after
[1:55:25] surgery immediately after
[1:55:29] surgery and my family they took up the
[1:55:32] whole waiting
[1:55:34] room at the hospital thank you Jesus am
[1:55:38] oh my it's
[1:55:41] just it's overwhelming when I think
[1:55:43] about
[1:55:48] it the heart of my precious wife
[1:55:52] at her eyes and seeing the pain she's
[1:55:54] going through it just broke
[1:55:57] me and that was after they took some of
[1:56:00] the stuff off of
[1:56:06] me and then the heart of my pastor
[1:56:09] brother Ron you can't see his face on
[1:56:12] there very well I don't know but I
[1:56:14] looked up at his eyes right there and he
[1:56:16] was
[1:56:18] broke weren't you brother Ron he was
[1:56:21] absolutely
[1:56:24] broke and he held my
[1:56:28] arm that's a heart of a pastor do
[1:56:34] you
[1:56:35] Michael a stepson looking over
[1:56:42] me now the
[1:56:45] Hoist Natalie where are
[1:56:48] you she remembers that I don't don't
[1:56:52] pretty much remember this whole thing
[1:56:54] but this was a little green thing I got
[1:56:56] a video I want to show you but this was
[1:56:57] a little they put you in I called it the
[1:56:59] Venus flight
[1:57:01] trap because that's what I felt like
[1:57:04] this thing encompassed you it closed you
[1:57:05] in I hated that
[1:57:08] thing and they take you from the bed
[1:57:10] over to a chair so you could
[1:57:14] sit
[1:57:17] and brother you want to play can you
[1:57:20] play that from there
[1:57:28] and there's Natalie
[1:57:30] she's helping with the
[1:57:36] Hoist no that was not
[1:57:40] fun I can tell you I hated that thing I
[1:57:43] and it just I hurt just they they would
[1:57:46] would want to come in and get me out of
[1:57:47] the bed put me in the chair I said just
[1:57:49] let me lay here and die I don't want to
[1:57:51] get in that thing
[1:57:55] Michael and Brian I don't now I'm going
[1:57:58] to tell you right here I don't remember
[1:58:00] a lot of this so um brother we get to a
[1:58:05] point if there's anything you want to
[1:58:06] say because he remembers and and can't
[1:58:09] remembers stuff but
[1:58:13] um oh you know I do want to go back you
[1:58:16] notice my fingers and my nose they're
[1:58:20] normal they're per
[1:58:23] I didn't know anything was going to
[1:58:26] happen and then this is where I I want
[1:58:29] to take my brother and sisters and they

[2:11:04] nurses came to get him to take him to
[2:11:07] amputation very
[2:11:11] somber
[2:11:12] moment and they wheel him out of the
[2:11:15] room we had prayed he's going down the
[2:11:17] room he gets about from here to the back
[2:11:19] of the church and he stops and he tells
[2:11:22] the two nurses wait a second wait

[2:11:39] said is that guy for
[2:11:42] real that listen and I said wouldn't you
[2:11:46] rather have a guy have a little bit of
[2:11:48] humor about it rather than woe is me and
[2:11:50] whatever ever but anyway I thought thank
[2:11:53] you brother Ron I was W you all that two
[2:11:56] feet
[2:11:58] shorter I
[2:12:02] was I thought about suing you yeah I

[2:12:07] have a leg to stand
[2:12:11] on these are true that's what he said
[2:12:13] these are true that's what I said that
[2:12:14] was I was being
[2:12:17] Neil
[2:12:20] so finger amputation and
[2:12:25] Angela daughter was with me and she's
[2:12:28] always happy and joyful and trying to
[2:12:31] make me laugh and she
[2:12:39] did now I want to pause right here I I
[2:12:43] want to tell you something two stories
[2:12:45] after my amputation and I I'll try to
[2:12:47] hurry I'm I'm
[2:12:49] sorry um
[2:12:54] they moved me from ICU into a
[2:12:57] room and I found out that I was going to
[2:13:00] be in a split room with somebody else
[2:13:02] and I started
[2:13:03] complaining and I said no I said I don't
[2:13:06] want to be with anybody else I want to
[2:13:08] be by
[2:13:09] myself and I did I I was angry I I was
[2:13:13] getting mad I said no I don't want to be
[2:13:15] with any
[2:13:17] else
[2:13:19] and we were in the they had to they
[2:13:21] moved me in the room and next to me was
[2:13:23] an old Mexican man and Karen was
[2:13:27] standing me
[2:13:31] and I had we had the Bible laying there
[2:13:34] and you know she would read to
[2:13:38] me and then all of a
[2:13:41] sudden this man next to me starts
[2:13:44] moaning and crying and I heard his moans
[2:13:47] and cries and I said Lord forgive me I
[2:13:50] said
[2:13:51] here I'm being selfish and wanting to be
[2:13:53] by myself and not with anybody else but
[2:13:58] this man next to me I said maybe there's
[2:13:59] a reason you want me to
[2:14:01] be you know next to this other person
[2:14:05] and I repented and I said Lord forgive
[2:14:07] me I'm sorry I said wherever I go it's
[2:14:11] it's going to be your will and I'm going
[2:14:12] to see it at that so I get over there
[2:14:15] and I'm laying there and my wife's a
[2:14:17] witness I I was sitting there and he's
[2:14:20] crying and moaning
[2:14:22] the curtain draws open and that man
[2:14:25] asked me to pray for him in
[2:14:29] Spanish I didn't understand a word he
[2:14:31] said but I knew what he was asking
[2:14:34] me and I said seor you pray for you and
[2:14:38] he said yeah and he started crying and I
[2:14:40] grabbed his feeble
[2:14:44] hand you have no idea all my pain my
[2:14:48] fingers everything I was going through
[2:14:49] was gone all I could think about was man
[2:14:52] and
[2:14:54] suffering and I grabbed his hand and I
[2:14:56] started praying and I said Lord please
[2:14:59] help this old man and I and I said a
[2:15:01] prayer for him my wife and I we both
[2:15:02] prayed for
[2:15:03] him and that was the most precious
[2:15:06] moment that I had in the hospital I said
[2:15:10] forgive me I will never complain again I
[2:15:13] said because I don't know where you're
[2:15:15] leading what you're doing amen
[2:15:18] and and so I prayed for him
[2:15:21] the very next morning the curtain opens
[2:15:25] again and he asked me to pray for him
[2:15:27] again prayed for him I never seen him
[2:15:30] again I don't know what happened but I
[2:15:32] know the Lord blessed that
[2:15:36] man and I thought Lord that's what it's
[2:15:38] all about if I my own pain and what I'm
[2:15:42] going through to help somebody else and
[2:15:45] and to help and pray for somebody else
[2:15:47] that's that's that's what it's all about
[2:15:51] so the next thing that happened to me I
[2:15:54] never seen him again I was I was in my
[2:15:56] room no fingers my legs are
[2:16:00] gone and a chaplain comes walking in and

[2:23:27] bed and as I laid in the
[2:23:31] bed I looked at my hands I look I
[2:23:34] remember my garage I couldn't reach up
[2:23:36] even grab a screwdriver my legs were
[2:23:38] gone I couldn't get out of bed and just
[2:23:41] walk and I started shaking and getting
[2:23:44] overwhelm really
[2:23:47] bad and I was just crying I I said God
[2:23:51] please comfort me please come down and
[2:23:54] comfort me he always
[2:23:55] has not this
[2:23:58] time it was silent dead silent nothing
[2:24:02] from the Lord at
[2:24:04] all and I
[2:24:07] thought where are you where are you Lord
[2:24:11] and it got worse and worse and worse as
[2:24:13] the minutes went by and I screamed out
[2:24:16] my God my God why have you forsaken me
[2:24:20] I cried out I said where are you I'm in
[2:24:23] the darkest time of my life I need you
[2:24:27] he wasn't
[2:24:28] there but he was
[2:24:32] there and I remembered a testimony of a
[2:24:35] brother I can't remember somebody can
[2:24:36] remind me who lost his wife and children
[2:24:39] I can't remember exactly what exactly
[2:24:42] happened but I'm laying there

[2:25:11] and I said I'm done I said I can't do
[2:25:13] any go to church this is too much for
[2:25:16] me the anchor held
[2:25:21] and then long about that
[2:25:23] [Music]
[2:25:26] time I remembered that this memor just
[2:25:29] popped in my
