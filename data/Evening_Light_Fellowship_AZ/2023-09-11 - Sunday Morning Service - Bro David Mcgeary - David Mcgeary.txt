up now everyone that doesn't have a key to the church put your hand down I'm trying to think how many keys I gave out we sure we sure okay um anyways the um if you have a key to the church knowing the procedure of how to do the alarm and everything is important everybody should know there's a certain entry exit doors you can't come in a side door the alarm goes off immediately you have to come in the front doors of that or the front doors of that building um also if you hear the sirens the alarm has gone off they'll call the police except I get notified and I negate 90 percent of the alarms uh I have a video I can see who does it but I don't ever say any names but uh the most important thing is that we have these things now that we all carry called smartphones if you don't know the

little but I don't think I'm sure they can fix that or let's bow our heads together it's more now gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're amongst your children this morning Lord and I'm one of them we're brothers and sisters were join Heirs of the Kingdom father we've been called from all walks of life from all different places because we heard a voice Lord there was something in our heart that came alive and ever since that Lord we've set out on a journey because we found that we're not of this world we're pilgrims and we're strangers and we're seeking a city to come and Lord rape come together today not because one is wiser than the other or greater than the other because we all find ourselves on the same journey together fighting the same struggles Lord but we've come this morning that you might speak to us father that we can take another step in the right direction that our burden would become a little lighter so that we could ever travel forward we just asked father that you would be our portion this morning in your precious sin wonderful name we pray amen amen amen I'm going to lower this I don't know it's not me that's the first time man I like first times don't you I don't know if you all sit up here but I'm not going to sing a special so you're welcome to go back to your seats and and everything I really appreciate it uh let's turn in our Bibles this morning and you know the last two evenings I appreciate all that came out uh you know brother Ron said that I I could only preach an hour I could just speak an hour are you fixing me up am I better and um so I only spoke 40 minutes so I took 20 minutes from each night and are gonna add it to this morning and uh and then he gave me no time limit so you know we we automatically have a time limit at home because we have an evening service but I you don't do nothing on Sunday so you might as well just sit around and rejoice in God's word amen would you turn with me to the Book of Joel The Book of Joel and and um it it's wonderful uh to be here like you said if you've known Ron a long time and I know Bill and Marshy is here my nephews here and and different ones so we're grateful for that I'm grateful to have three sons that serve the Lord a brother that preaches the gospel that's a real blessing to me and so I appreciate all them and all that they're doing for the kingdom and it says here we'll start with the second verse here it says hear this Ye Old Men and give ear all the inhabitation of the land half this been your days or even in the days of your fathers tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation for that which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the locth hath left half the canker worm eaten and that which the canker worm have left hath the caterpillar eaten our heavenly father asks that you bless us this morning in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you may be seated uh we're going to be speaking a little bit this morning I kind of as a pastor I'm not really much of an evangelist and I'm certainly not as energetic as I used to be but you find out that um there's ways that you can do things a lot simpler and so I have become a simpleton and and uh but I I hope that God is hidden Simplicity this morning I'm not a man of elegant words uh but I I do uh have a great desire for those that are lost and those that are suffering and it's I I can't change what I am uh uh it's the way that God made me I I know that I've been forgiven much and the scripture says that he who hath been forgiven much loves much and the greatest part of my life that I've found is I've known the depth of Sin from which God brought me and people have heard my testimony and and my testimony describes myself as a saint compared to the darkness that I was really in and to think that he could reach to that depth of Darkness and find something that he had placed in me before the foundation of the world and bring it to life and we never want to get away from them now I'm sure that you're here this morning because you believe that God sent a pillar of fire in this generation that he raised up a man born of God and and predestined by God and gifted to be a Divine interpreter of the word of God we're here this morning because we've heard the shout of our day and we know that we have an absolute in the message at and if we can't stray from it I'd like to read the way that he spoke it in the Sumerian Church she said only one messenger for each age receives what the Holy Spirit has to say to that age oh preachers hate that I kind of wanted to give some what I had but I have nothing and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but throughout its broadcast for all who come within range of the message the message is received individually by only a sweat certain qualified group in a certain way amen number yourself amongst them this morning I'm one of them I'm one of them who have received that word in a certain way from The Voice which he brought it each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger boy this is your description you can hear what the messenger says because you're a qualified group of people you were pre-qualified before the foundations of the world you were you were given this uh you you you came in range of the voice and it it spoke to you and you can see hear what the spirit is is saying by way of The Messengers those who here are qual are not getting their own private revelation nor is it a is a group getting their Collective revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God amen now I didn't read that for you I read that for me because I know if I say what he said there's a qualified group of people here this morning that will hear it I'd like to visit with you this morning like I said I'm I'm not an evangelist I Pastor a church in Dallas Fort Worth and and um and um I've been there for a little while now but um I just have a way of doing things after so many years you know and it's just hard to teach an old dog new tricks I I see a lot of preachers come along and they've got a certain style and I think man I wish I could do that and and every time I try it I fail so I'm just gonna do things the way that I do it and trusting in Him but I'd like to speak to you this morning out of the message the Palmer worm a cankerworm caterpillar and Locus and because I I feel on my heart it's extremely needful and this morning if you have a need I don't know whether it's sickness or Finance or whatever your need is um he already knows it and his desire through the preaching of the word of God is to unclog and break down everything that would keep you from getting to your Source your fountain because I believe there's a fountain of Living Water that Springs up within the Church of the Living God and that he's still the same and he said he can do exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ask her thing if we could just find our path to him now I don't know if you are capable here but I could give you the paragraphs that I'm going to be reading from and if they could post those and you could read along with me because that would be that would be wonderful and uh and so we would like to do that he said now one of the things that the prophet brings to us and and this was in paragraph 36 of this book and it's the way that God works and he says this now remember the only thing can work as you work it in the law of that thing so if something can only work in the law according to the law that it was created to work in so if you if you have a certain thing and it's made a certain way the only way it'll work is if it works within that law and that applies to us as Believers we can only do things according to God's way of doing it at man's always tried to come up with a different way of doing things and and that's why we have Creeds and dogmas and we've got so many different things but God's never changed the command's always been changing God's ways always trying to find a different way for God to do things or kind of presuming what God meant so I think this is what God meant and so I'll try it this way or or I'll try it that way but there's absolutely a law that every single one of us is under and that's the law that God had pre-planned for us and we can't escape that law God had a way for you to hear and he chose that way to be preaching by the foolishness of preaching uh P he did it oh can you put it on that screen too then I know it's there unless you'd like me to preach like this but that that's the way that he chose it he chose the word of God to come and to prick your heart and God doesn't work from the outside he works from the inside out so if he wants to you know if you want to a seed to grow or a tree to grow the scripture says that what a husband Tree does is he digs it up and he gets down to the roots and he he puts what it needs in The Roots the the source and so your root is your heart The Roots is where it had came from the seed and and so what you're growing from and what you're what you're growing into is because there's a seed down in your heart and that's what God wants to start that's where he starts so he you a lot of us think he works from our head well our our the head's great you you know what I mean but there's a battler in that head every time that you that something goes through your mind you have the enemy there and he battles it and he fights it and he works on it and he destroys it and he distorts it in everything but you know God can bypass your head and he can go straight to your heart and then he can bring that word straight to your heart and you don't even know what's going on but there's something inside of you and that causes you to cry out when God converted me and I saw all the the darkness that I was in and all of a sudden my eyes opened up and I really saw what path I was on I didn't ask God to open my eyes I didn't say oh God open my eyes no he opened my eyes and basically he said you're in hell [Applause] and and I just I I couldn't do anything I just stopped there and I said God help me God help me I don't know what I am but I'm not this now that bypassed my mind and went straight to what was inside of me predestinated from the foundation of the world it's the trouble with civilization that's why civilization education and Sciences of the devil because it's a mind clutter [Applause] Satan's designed it to discredit the word of God to keep it from coming past all the things that are in that in your mind to keep that word from getting straight to your heart and what do we call that we call that reasoning [Applause] it's just like you know people want to say well what's up this guy's sleeve or or where is he going I I've got to get a grip on this you can't get a grip on me this morning because I don't know where I'm going someone said you're going to ruin your ministry I said fine I never wanted to be a preacher in the first place so something's got to work according to God's law and God chose the word of God he chose the preaching of the Gospel he chose not to give you something that you could understand but to give you something that you can believe God never said do you understand it have you figured it out all he wants is what's inside of you to say I believe I don't know why I believe it it didn't come from here it didn't come from reasoning it was a deep in here calling to a d it was a response that was in me that I didn't even know I have and that's the way God works That's the Law this morning that is is taking place right here not because of where we are or what group we are or what we sit under because he's not talking about he's talking about a particular group of people that's elected and chosen before the foundation of the world to hear the word and the voice of that messenger and so that's that's the the truth of the matter is we understand that and he said so uh that there's there's only one thing then it's everything has got to work according to the laws of God and he says in paragraph 40 he says that's the way it is with the kingdom of God we've got to find out what's wrong then work from that the scriptures is like a doctor's prescription so that's what he said so as we build I just wanted to lay a few little thoughts uh here that he brought out he says therefore in this is paragraph 42 therefore if there's something wrong in the church today that it's not progressing the way it should it's to my opinion that we ought to go back to the prescription now I'm not here to criticize and I'm not here to say as a judge but I would think after all this time that we would have progressed farther than we have in fact more carnality is coming into the church and more doubt and and more doubt in one another and the ground is shaky and it's uncertainty and it isn't I would say it's because of us but it's because of the atmosphere of confusion that we find ourselves in and that's the purpose is to for the enemy wants to shake the very Foundation by which you were converted if he can get you to doubt your conversion or he can get you to doubt your pardon if he can get you to doubt your experience then he can get that little seed of Doubt beginning to work in your heart he'll take years and years and years to work on it and there's only one prescription for that sickness and that's the word of God that's the scriptures that's the prescription our prescription in our date is the revealed scriptures for our day the message that the believer hears is the prescription for for the burden that's on your heart and in your mind the trouble that you're facing the confusion that you're up against the sickness that you're dealing with God knew it long before it ever got here so he gave the church the one thing that would take it all the way through and that was the word of God [Music] okay and so that we've got to stay with the prescription he says he says something I said we got to go back to the prescription find out just exactly what's wrong that is the church is so sick that there is disease in our church sin disease we've got to find what the doctor prescribed and see if our druggist pastors are giving us the right prescription I'm a pastor Ron's a pastor I sure he invades you to take whatever he's preaching and run it through the prescription that's what you want to be built on you don't want to be built on testimony you don't want to be built on on reputation and let's face it God never fed his church with yesterday's manna [Applause] he never filled his church with stories I've given my testimony but I don't come every place they go and tell the story tell the story tell the story churches become story time and it's not story time it's challenging time it's time to judge ourselves it's time to see if we're taking the prescription and if this prescription's having an effect if the prescription is not having effect because it's mixed with something else you ever read abolishes don't take this with this don't take this with this don't take this with this you don't want to sudden and if we got too many side effects church this is rapturing time this isn't time to do to do anything but make sure that we're on the direct course to the promise of God and that we've laid hold of what God wants us to lay hold of and that that we have what he's given us to be successful man the word of God says we're fools when we compare ourselves one with another if I compared my church to this church I'd be a fool every Church ought to preach three kinds of Believers the guy said How's your church I don't know I said I just got more make-believers than unbelievers than I ever had the Believers predestinated that number is never going to change you got to do is you got to make sure you've identified yourself in the word of God and you know you're born again there's just not I'll skip these paragraphs but there's not the sincerity that there used to be now you've got a gymnasium back here I think it's great but I hope you never play basketball on Sunday when you could be in here here in the word of God but all across our country now that's what's going on I'm okay with sports that's fine you got this bird team here in town you might like that bird team and then you've got some other guys that think there's some sort of diamonds you know I think they're coal but uh because that don't matter but don't give them time that you're not giving equal time to sharing the gospel that you're not giving equal time to spreading the word of God to going somewhere to passing out tracks making a phone call send it out emails you know wouldn't it be wonderful if all the internet lit up all of a sudden I don't know all these things face tube and and uh you know we used to call it all a boob tube you know what I mean but because that's what I've met with the word of God out there God sent a message hear the message of God going to say we got in church down there that prays for the stick bring your people if you're lost if you're seeking a problem come on in Hallelujah give the gospel equal time I told the old people I said it's not too late to work for the kingdom I told the young people I'm glad to be here with you because you're more like me than the other group it took let me just say it this way because I I don't want to go negative in any form at all but don't you think God's got more for us more power more life more victory [Applause] he's can put within us the ability to take Satan and possess his Gates drive them out of our life claim our children claim our loved ones see the resurrection move in our midst because we are going to work according to his law we want to be sincere so he talked about these insects this is paragraph 47. we'll read here as we just we're moving to a point we're not going to go through the whole book we're going to go to one point this morning you say why are you putting it there because the true bride hears from the messenger I think it's a shame in this country today all the message churches we have where the very source of life is the voice of God everything we teach from this Pulpit is supposed to come from that messenger because he's the only source he is the voice of God to the church and yet our churches are playing less tapes and less tapes and less tapes you hardly have a congregation anymore that'll sit under the voice of the messenger and have that voice go out to each of those members of that bride and speak to him you want to be come to in unity come under what that God's brought you here under and that's that voice of that messenger angel I'm not tape only that's someone says oh I preached the sermon one day and he said oh I see your tape only really then another guy come up and said I see you don't believe in Preachers I said well you guys are calling me a hypocrite no I believe in it but I believe it's a resource that God's given if you had a sick child wouldn't you use every resource to make that child well [Applause] you take her to specialist you take her to the doctors you'd bring this one in you'd bring that one in you use every medicine in fact if somebody told you and said you know what I I ate some seed weed from from the the Great Coral Reef off the coast of New Zealand and it's a green purple uh seaweed and if you eat this it'll make you better I'll guarantee you you'd be down in New Zealand diving for seaweed the tapes are a resource they're not the only resource if I'd say that singing's a resource preaching's a resource but it's one of the resources that God's given the church that the bride can hear together and God can speak to every single one of us at the same time under that voice it's what we live by you can't live by my sermon you can't live by my voice you can't live by Brother Ronson you can only live by what he says that the messenger said That's the Law of God for the believer in our day and it must be done according to God's law back to the word the source he said now these insects if you'll get your book on insects you'll notice that there's four different insects it's the self same insect four different stages of its life all of us know that a cocoon is nothing but a caterpillar covered over and it's going to hatch out into a butterfly and a butterfly is a caterpillar before it hatches out the palm of worm the locus also forth is the same thing same insect now now whatever now listen close whatever happened in the first place with the insect of the Palmer just before became a caterpillar later and the powder care became a locust later whatever it was that started in the beginning is still the same thing that's causing the trouble today let's go back now to the scriptures and find out what started now this prophet's calling him caterpillar canker worm but may I say it this way not for doctrinal's sake but to stir your minds up to where that we're talking in our day it's the same spirit right it's working the same way today but we've come to know by the opening of the seals that that is a white horse a red horse a black horse and a Pale Horse so we've got to go find out what trouble did those guys cause and we're not going to go through the seals this morning but it's the same thing that started the same thing so if if we we want to get well then we've got to find out what was it that this thing ate off the church what got away from us okay because if we're having trouble something slipped away and so that's what we want what what slipped away what am I missing I hate to do a puzzle where somebody's kept one piece out and put it in their pocket because you can't complete the picture and I want the picture completed God had a picture of me in his mind and I want him to complete that picture I want every piece of that puzzle to be in my life I want to be what he wants me to be and the word of God is here to take me from what I am to what he wants me to be now this is graph 49. now we know that we can only build a church first upon the materials that God has given us to build it with the churches went and tried to build itself with social with personality I like Joel Osteen they said how why are you successful he says why do people flock to you he said because I Don't Preach against sin I preach that everybody's an overcomer that God loves everybody and and there's nothing that keeps God from blessing you well I could have read farther in the scriptures and the next scriptures that he talks about and he says they've turned the word of God into a lie that's a lie you can't escape the requirements of God you can't change the formula the formula has always been repent it doesn't matter if they wrap your arms around you and say oh I'm so glad you're here right brother brother or or you know he didn't cut it's not a group revelation can only build upon what God gave us to build with that's all we have all you got you're stuck with it you are stuck with the sermons and the messages that the prophet has brought you to make you what he needs you to be to make the rapture we are stuck with what God the material that God gave us to build with no I don't care what some other great architect tries to come along with or some other thing or some idea I don't want to test no new ideas when it comes to my soul I don't want to cast no new interpretations no new explanations no can no no more putting stuff together and and drawing this from that and coming up with some stew because there's poison in that pot I want to stay with what he said [Applause] I want to hear it I want to read it and I want it revealed to me pray for Revelation more than anything else pray for Revelation and the Revelation can only come from the material that God gave you for that Revelation to come from [Applause] I don't care how enticing words they are I don't care how anointed they get if it's not from the original Source it's not real [Applause] I know this is strong and it's on tape and hundreds of people around the world will hear I don't have to ask the question do I 100 people around the world here but before we can ever have a building of the Church of God we will have to restore back all those things that these insects have eaten out of it we'll have to go back and find out what those insects eat before this Vine of the Lord the Grapevine he's the vine we are the branches and before we can ever find out or the church can stand in its formal and original Power it will have to go back and find out what the insects eat and that church will have to be restored back to that or it will never stand in its power and Glory of its first standing and how many knows what Malachi 4 was to do it was to restore back the Faith of Our Fathers [Applause] that the works that I do you can do also man has been trying to produce those works with his own formula he's been trying to describe what it means to be born again let the holy spirit is we've wasted so many words on things that's in God's hands and God's hands alone when he bursts you you know it [Applause] you don't know any need to tell you you don't need me to try to create a definition of the holy spirit that you can put in your mind and wrap your mind around God works in mysterious ways when he comes to your heart when he bursts that seed he can do it where he wants when he wants and how he wants but if you're predestinated that birth is yours and you can't make it happen the best you can do is know there's a spot in your heart that you need filled and be honest with yourself I've been 50 years in this message everybody thinks this of me everybody thinks that of me I've got this reputation I can't let it let me tell you if you're not born again you need to get burned again else you're lost can't hide behind anything this is manifesting time this is proof in the pudding this is what's flowing from the mouth the elect says nothing until it's not saith the Lord and thus saith the Lord comes in the word of God the mouth of God the voice of God that God sent in this hour to the bride sorry for getting excited but it's life or death for me and we got a cold lukewarm worldly entangled mentally poisoned Church how do you know brother McGarry because I have the same disease I gotta look in the mirror the scripture says in John he says here in the love of God is made perfect that as he is so are we in this world how's that for a test am I okay you want to send me if your crock pot or your instant pot's gonna burn your food please go I've just used my 20 minutes from the first service the deacons just said they're not going to let you out do we have to understand that there's a first standing of that church that there's an original Foundation he says in paragraph 51 in the scripture God's holy Bible is the lifeline to any church how could we ever bring up grapes app through Sycamore bark it won't work we've got to have grape Bart we've got to have the original bars there's only one way that the bark can ever come back on the vine is when God grows it himself I can't grow it this morning I'm limited all he said was go into all the world and preach the gospel it's all I can do the foolishness of preaching just go preach it whoever will hear it preach it now I'm not I'm not preaching to you this morning I am reading to you what he said the question is is it speaking to you I don't want to be afraid for God to speak to me remember the little woman that with the ointment and everything and she was going to go anoint Jesus's feet and she sat back there and the prophet of God said she said if I go down there and take this oil and anoint his feet he will know what I did to get the money to buy the oil but you know it prevailed he said he's the only one that can help me and there's I'm not I'm not ashamed that he knows I'm not ashamed I've got nothing to hide he's the only one that can help me God's got to do it himself you can put all kinds of stuff on it all kinds of programs all kinds of stuff all kinds of these things but until God grows it it don't work now we're talking about this eating you know and and you know a lot of times bugs work from the inside out I think we have tree people here maybe it works from the inside out and it's just what's happening to the church and what's happening to the believer everything looks good on the outside everything that's good we're dressed right or buildings are nice we've come from the Sheepfold and and and now it seems like we're moving into the palace and everything is is beautiful but on the inside we're being ate up he's eaten away in our heart he's eaten away at our experience we can smile we can look good on the outside everything's fine but down inside something's chewing away at us it's robbing us of the of the the fountainish it's just plugging up our spring our faith is weakening or courage has been placed in the shell we're concerned about our standing and what people think what's worse we're afraid of what one another thinks I will hope that I would be in a body of Believers that had such love one for another that if I came to the altar there wouldn't be a bunch of gossipers that want to know what is he down there for or or or all the many discerners oh he's down there because he did this and he done that and and oh I knew he never had faith I knew all along there was something wrong with him well if you know all the wrong that there was something wrong with him and you didn't do anything about it I got news for you you have to go back to the same place that he's at or you go to hell oh don't think you're immune from hell it may be hell on this Earth but you will reap the wages of sin and the tongue is an unruly member that's hard to be Bridal and I hear so much bitterness come out of the fountain that's supposed to be sweet that I hope God speaks to your heart this morning wouldn't it be terrible if we had to put out there on the same evening like gospel gossip Fellowship we'll talk about the Dead if we think it'll put a brownie point on us I don't need brownie points I need the blood God's got only one provided place that he meets the believer and that's under the shed blood and if you've ever been washed by that blood you'll never judge another person am I screaming would you pray the Lord calms me down because I want to go I want to get out of here and now all I need is one more real believer and then the bride's gone he said it only take can Joe Leslie's here but we only count as one somebody was there the other night would you put it in your heart to be one of the eight it eats away at us and all of a sudden we found out we're ate up we're ate up everything looks good brother you look good you know what I mean you look like you're about 18. do you know what I mean you're maybe 28 I don't know you know if you look good you look you look great you all look like Believers you all got your hair nice and and you're dressed nice and you're part of a big thing you know the biggest thing in Phoenix the thing that's going on but the worms crawling through your life was crawling through your heart you're not positive the tokens apply you're not positive you've got the affair good that it's been paid for you you're not real sure whether you're born again you're not real sure whether that you're gonna make it you don't know if your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life or not I'd like to kill that bug that boar and you know how you'll kill the boar you inject the poison in the root I have a source for that information listen to what he says are you interested in what he said amen he says he says no wonder this is paragraph 53 no wonder we we can't have healing campaigns no wonder the churches are are tore up no wonder one will say oh this that and the other so disagree no wonder there's such isms Among Us it's because we can't bear the real fruit of patience long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness the lifeline has been cut off from the tree and will never bring it up through Creeds of some rag or some substitute bark it'll take the power of almighty God to grow that tree back to its condition again how many want to go back to the original condition you can claim all that you want but the evidence of the tree is the fruits and that's what he's keeping the church from producing is the fruit and I'm going to move quickly now he says in paragraph 55 I'm going to drive this down and I want you to listen let it be God's truth let's line up with what God Said regardless of what anybody else says I want to use four different things of what I see in the scriptures that these insects have eaten off the Church of the Living God and has got the vine of God crippled and stunted okay paragraph 67. now let's go back and I want to name four different just as the scriptures as I know how to be that these insects have eaten from the church from it first original condition that's what he took away from the church was the original condition my mother spend a lot of time on that because I want to really go someplace else this morning but that's what's happened is the original condition of the church Satan changed the condition and changed the requirements he says it's the original condition now the first thing the church has to establish he says the first thing the church was established on the day of Pentecost Peter preached an inauguratal sermon at The Bachelor attorney at service when the church was born Christian Church was born on the day of Pentecost and if God is infinite and cannot change his church must remain as it was at the beginning do you admit that amen so the the first thing that we've we realized that the the condition changed and that's the first thing that we we understand that James even said he says there's people that have come in amongst you there's wrinkles and spots in your feast in other words you're not keeping it holy no more the tokens gone out we've let we've let little things in you know and and and I'm not here to try to balance all those things because you've got a pastor for that you know but if you let your kids play a game or something or join a team you better talk to them real good if you're going to send your kid to public school you better talk to them real good you better tell your children and your children and the generations to come you ought to really make them aware you got to get them to understand not everybody's a Believer and they're not like everybody else they're going to want to be but something like somebody else but just think of those people those people were used to being Sanctified and set of tied at Pentecost they were circumcised Jews that went up there they were in condition for the spirit to come now we know we're Gentiles so there's one thing that gets us in the condition and that's the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and the word of God but we've got to apply the token to our lives we've got to separate from the world we can't walk with the world and serve God and I'm not going to give a list of what the world is because each of you should know what it is that hindered you from being what you should be and you've got to make that decision yourself if not we'll form a Creed and it'll be the Creed of evening gossip Tabernacle this is what we believe this is how we do it this is what we looked at things this is what we think about sports this is what we think about this this is our opinion on dating this is this you're not entitled to your opinion you have a messenger sent from God that the true bride hears that's your opinion and you need to hold one another to that opinion if you love one another hold them to that opinion in love hold your pastor to that opinion hold the church to that opinion hold the deacons to that opinion hold the trustees for the opinion and if they won't line up with the word of God pray for them because there's a Rapture coming and it's got to come quick because he said if he didn't shorten the days no flesh would be saved man are becoming women women are becoming man Satan has sat on the throne he's now saying I can God made a male and female he says that's not true I will make them I will give man the power to choose what they are if that don't scare the liver out of you when that lady stood up there in purple yeah I don't know how many prophesies were fulfilled men with masks and and all locked up and all the things the prophet of God that said but has it really affected us hasn't made us change our life has it made us re-evaluate where we're had what we're listening to what we're doing what we're fellowshipping with has it made one change in your life in order you say brother Mary Gary why are you a picture because I can't make it without you yeah I'm Abraham seed I gotta run after lot if he's not going to live right I gotta go down to the city I don't want to leave anybody behind I'm sure that's your heart's desire too now I'm going to start my sermon I've used up all the time and then some but you know this may be my last time ever to preach not maybe I'm just not saying here this may be the last time I ever preach I don't know but I want to be true do we got to make sure that we're back to the original condition we want to go back to the original condition now I wanted to spend now after all I said I want to preach you what's on my heart this morning will you allow me to do that we all know the statue of a perfect man and the First Foundation is what faith we know that faith has to rest upon something right Faith final resting place is the word but I want to bring a little more insight if I could not my insight the Insight that's written in this message to really what that is we've got a church that as a body looks fine it looks healthy but we've got hearts and spirits that are being eaten alive we've got people that are in secret are fighting things they can't overcome we've got mind battles that are pushing us from one side to the other we've got a roaring lion that's going about seeking whom he may devour we're fighting spiritual wickedness in high places there's been two hundred thousand demon demons loosed on the bride at the river Euphrates I don't even know if I said that right it might have been 200 000 000. so if we're trying to be drawn to rapturing condition and we know that there's been something that's been eating away at us and stealing from us what it is and it's our foundation and it's our condition and their long-range plans I had a man a friend of mine one time he he never could accept the promise of God he was afraid to accept his healing he was afraid to accept his Deliverance and I asked him one day I just talked to him my heart was bleeding for him the guy lived right he was a Believer he was a brother I knew the seed was in him but there was something in him that was just eating them up and I finally taught me he says brother what is it and the Lord just touched his heart and he began to say you know when I was a boy alls I ever wanted was one of those big fire trucks that you hook the hose to I had one I knew what he was talking about and it had little hoses and you could spray it and everything he says that's all I ever wanted and he said one day I forgot to take out the trash or I forgot to make my bed he said my dad took me back and he opened the trunk of his car and he pointed to that fire truck and he said you would have got this fire truck if you weren't such a little evil person and he shut the trunk just a young boy he was afraid to desire a gift because he was encompassed with the fear that it would be taken away from him fear and failure launches from the same spot it starts at the same place if you've got fear that if you make a step you won't be able to follow through or you're afraid you'll fall you you don't want you don't want it make the the the chance to step out on faith because you you don't know what the result is that faith is not built in the right thing all right faith is not something you can muster up it's not something you can create you are helpless you can say I believe I believe but Faith isn't the doctrine you believe faith is a gift of God lest any man should boast faith is something that God shows you and the church has to be built on the right faith now you might want to jump a little ahead and heard sermons on faith and go to your library of your mind and do all those things and that's okay but don't miss what I'm going to read to you because it's the answer I don't know if we're televised or we're streaming or whatever who watches and who don't particularly I don't care I'm only talking to you this morning I don't have a worldwide Ministry I don't want a worldwide Ministry I want to tell the people that can hear my voice about him paragraph 77. now one of the first things that I'd like to speak to you for a few minutes after we have found out that the foundation must be original it must go back to the foundation it must go back to where it was a vine right he is a vine ye are the branches we've heard so many teaching on that the vine is not operating right let's go find out what's wrong now one of the first things that I'd like to mention is that something has gone from our church and one of the main things is faith now we say I believe the message I have faith I'm glad you have that faith because that's where the will allow you to hear this excuse me the people don't have faith today like they had in that day some kind of canker worm or some sort has got in God got in and eaten off the lifeline of faith they changed it today our faith rests upon some kind of big church denomination but Jude told us in the third verse he said behold I give all diligence to write unto you of common salvation for it was needful me to write unto you have I have told you here before me and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints that was 33 years before this faith was delivered so our faith is something that we should earnestly contend for but we've substituted knowledge for faith we've substituted things for what faith really is because the faith if we could this morning all find where God wants us to put our faith and we would all put that Faith together this morning if you are Brokenhearted you will be mended I don't know when I don't need instant results if you're backslid you'll have a desire to be renewed again if you're all sick you'll know that there's a fountain for you faith is not a hope so it's an Evidence and the problem of God is going to tell us exactly what that evidence is and I'm gonna have you read it so you know this is not a fancy sermon it's not enticing words it's what the messenger is telling us that we're lacking and I'm not too proud to humble myself before the Vindicated word of God so we we see that he tells us that our faith he says here he says in paragraph 80 when we were called Saints when they were Sanctified the Holy Spirit Sanctified them they were called Saints now Jude says Brothers Foster brother of Jesus I want you to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints don't never let that Faith drop and the faith of the Saints was not in Creeds not in denominations not in church buildings now I hear it all the time at home we're building a building and there isn't a day that someone doesn't pull into my parking lot and say oh you're building a church that's wonderful God must be really moving I can't build my faith in that and in fact really their their voices of distraction look what God's doing they're moving from here they're moving from there they're coming in you know the prophet of God told us there'd be a false Revival and it's going on now people's faith is that they speak in tongues that they prophesy where's that zapper their faith they're resting place is in their Fellowship one with another in what we believe I believe the prophet said this I believe the prophet taught that I I believe that well to the outside world that's just your Creed they believe their Creeds right they believe it's the word of God they'll defend it with their life they'll give you scripture after scripture after scripture after scripture but that's not what he wants us to build our faith in that is not what the believer rests in is not in church buildings not in associations well we're starting to develop all kinds of Ministerial Association me and wrong Fellowship together me and this brother Fellowship together and and I stream this brother and I stream that brother I'm glad you streamed give the voice of God equal time God only asked for 10 percent you know why you stream here and stream there because you can't find what's satisfying you you're looking for a new flavor man's never changed and the word of God has never changed he's the same that's because we've we've slipped we are not the church we should be we present everything else out there oh how many Sunday school rooms do you got you got five I'm going to build six how many chairs do you have in here you got maybe 250 I'm gonna put 375. now I'm The Voice the prophet of God said there's no Unity people are Trucking Spears at each other over their Doctrine interpretation well there's I don't know of anybody so it was a greater sinner than me I can't even speak of those things which were done in darkness lest the spirit attach it let's just take a moment and catch this together it's built on associations not in associations but faith of the Saints is built in this one thing but it was in the presence of the Living God they had faith to heal the sick to cast out Devils to do miracles all these great promises that Jesus made that first church held on to that it was the lifeline now he said the reason that they could do all these Works was not because of the command I see so many people come God told me to go into all the world and lay up my hands on the sick you can lay your hands in the sick all you want that's not what faith is built in the disciples faith was built when they went into that Upper Room at Pentecost that he said I'll be with you even in you till the end their faith was built on the presence of Jesus Christ they knew he was there [Applause] that's what they did the works by they did the works because they knew he was there their faith was not in the letter their faith was in his presence that's what they believed how many notes are messengers stood there and he was talking and talking and talking he says you know I'm waiting for something and then all of a sudden he's here he's here I take every spirit in this building in my control in the name of Jesus Christ what did he put his faith in he put his faith in because he was here their faith was in the presence what was the whole Ministry in this day what was it all about he came back and he veiled himself in a prophet did the same works that he did when he was here to identify his presence with us because this church was only going to rise up it was only gonna be what it was meant to be when it turned back to the foundation of faith and that Faith was not in his doctrines not in his Creed your faith isn't that God sent a prophet God sent Ezekiel God sent Jeremiah God sent John the Baptist try to put your faith in that you've got to put your faith in him because he's here get up [Applause] not up there not in here this is the identification by which you know that it's him but the church faith is built on one thing his presence that he is here to perform and do that which he said he would do if you're looking for an anointing you're looking for a spirit you're looking for a certain atmosphere you will miss it but when you know behind the shadow of a doubt that he's here he's here he said he would be here I know he's here I feel he's here I see that he's here he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's here to do what he said he would do if that's what my faith anchors in my faith anchors in the presence oh I don't want a church that socially epped I want a church that's got the presence management that when they walk through those doors they're not looking to judge what's being said they're looking for one thing Lord do I see you are you here Lord and if you're not here I want this church to know I brought them I want you to this morning to know I brought them you may not believe that but I'm here to tell you I come from God and I go to God I brought them because I brought his word I brought the voice of the messenger to you and he told me that he is here to perform every thing that he promised you say well I'm a sinner he knows that I've done this he knows that you think there's something he don't know we all want to get well before we take the medicine there's only one thing that's going to fix you and that's his presence and there's only one thing that's going to make it work is when God grows it when God fixes it all he asks you to do do you believe that he's here no do you really believe he's here that his person is here and I want to go into all this well he's veiled in the bride well if I have to see what bride they say they are I ain't looking there I'm looking at the pulpit I'm not looking at one thing unknowing one thing he has a visible presence that's manifested by The Works that he does and he said that he's here if you've been struggling and that worm's been eaten your heart if you could anchor your faith that he's here to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you could ask or think you can have what you asked for but if you think my prayer or my lane on of hands you say well that's what the Bible said but he said that it's through Christ Jesus that we do all things all things are performed by his presence if the faith in his presence that was the foundation of the church they sat like cowards in the upper room faith I thought this was him I thought this in we heard it was right he said go and Tarry tell I come I will send you another comforter for I will be with you and even in you until the end I don't care what you're struggling with he's here he knows it he sees it but if you know he's here he's here to do for you he would send His Garment out over the congregation trying to get the people to believe he was here you sir you're suffering with heart trouble the Lord knows that he's here do you recognize it do you feel that sensation all over you that's him what was he trying to get him to realize that he was here he said you know you think it's me I'll turn my back to the audience you little sister back there right over here to my right that's Desiring to have a baby God hears you why what was he trying to get their faith in him no he was a vessel he was trying to let him know he's here he's present he's using me the vessel the prophet of God to show you that he's here and that he's the same yesterday today and forever and if you think you can run to him 2 000 years ago you can run to them tonight because he's here but that's not where our faith is our faith is in our Doctrine our faith is in our building our faith is in our association I didn't say it that was spiritual food and due season that he put in the storehouse because one day he knew he would have to go back in there and bring that food to his church so they could turn their hearts and get rid of the Catholic spirit that thinks you're going because you belong you say Brother David while you're preaching children I need you I need the church to rise up I got an enemy that's trying to bury people so far deep the Troubles of their heart and mind is devouring their very insides I need just one person in here that would agree with me that he's here then no devil in hell can stand in our bed I'm not afraid to make the challenge he's here to keep his word [Applause] is your faith built on his presence or is it built on the doctrine of your brain run our brains start to fail us but his presence it has never failed me if I don't pronounce my words right if I don't walk right if I can't think there's one thing that I know he lives and he's here and he'll do what he said he'll do would you read one more paragraph with me I guess the musicians can come I wish you knew that little song we sing at home called stay it says stay I don't want you to go I've got such a hunger in my heart I need you so it's a beautiful song because I don't want that presence to go because that's where my faith is my faith is when he preaches the word then he's there to perform it and my faith is in his presence you say I thought it was the word he is the word amen amen the letter killeth but the presence that spoke those words is here that's the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the presence that's outside of you that saves you and heals you the one you had to recognize [Music] to come get what you have need of the fall down at his feet and that's for healing our blessing he performs what he said he would do and then he comes from the outside
