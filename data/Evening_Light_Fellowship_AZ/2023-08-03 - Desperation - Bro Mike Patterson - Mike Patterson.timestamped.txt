[35:33] now for therefore hearken over his rule
[35:36] unto the statutes and unto the judgments
[35:40] which I teach you
[35:42] for to do them that she may live and go
[35:45] in and possess the land which the Lord
[35:48] God of your fathers giveth you
[35:52] you shall not add unto The Words which I
[35:56] pronounce you neither shall ye diminish
[36:00] ought from it that ye may keep the
[36:04] Commandments of the Lord your God which
[36:07] I command you
[36:08] your eyes have seen what the Lord did
[36:11] promise of belchspore
[36:14] for all the men that followed belpora
[36:17] the Lord thy God had destroyed them from
[36:21] among you but ye shall cleave unto the
[36:25] Lord your God
[36:27] and ye awards every one of you this day
[36:32] may God add His blessings to the word
[36:34] you may be seated
[36:39] as we look to the word of God it's an
[36:41] honor to be here honestly to speak the
[36:43] word of God I
[36:45] I mean that sincerely we got a talk on
[36:49] desperation
[36:51] that uh
[36:53] things in our life create desperation
[36:56] you have to have a problem to have it
[36:59] there's certain things that make you
[37:01] rejoice through certain things that make
[37:03] you sad there's certain things that
[37:07] put the word of God out in your life and
[37:09] these are things we want to dress about
[37:13] I attend the service here and
[37:17] fortunate on
[37:19] mainly Sundays to come and
[37:21] get a good opportunity a good look at
[37:24] everybody and how much you love the Lord
[37:27] and
[37:28] I want to see the hearts of those that
[37:31] God
[37:33] does things for your heart
[37:35] it Thrills my heart to see the life go
[37:38] into you and the songs you rejoice over
[37:42] in the gospel you hear and the things
[37:43] you do and that's what I'm talking about
[37:47] and I thought as I listened to some of
[37:50] these we heard a brother preach from war
[37:52] shooting 10 I believe it was West
[37:54] Washington
[37:55] and I thought at the conclusion of his
[37:58] sermon as he was talking
[38:01] I thought about about 400 people were
[38:03] sitting here
[38:05] and I thought dear God they need a touch
[38:08] from you to make them alive to what
[38:12] you're talking about
[38:14] and I I uh I'm not being critical
[38:19] I don't mean to be harsh but I as I sit
[38:22] there I said to myself what could I do
[38:25] to help them what could they do to help
[38:27] me to look better and I began to look at
[38:31] people and I wonder about the
[38:34] manifestation of a living God that lives
[38:37] within all of our presence
[38:41] it ought to cause a stir it ought to
[38:44] caught a mold it really ought to do
[38:46] something different to you
[38:49] amen a lot of times we look for certain
[38:52] things to happen and I thought as the
[38:54] brother made some mention I thought I'd
[38:56] like to see them all saved and on their
[38:58] way to heaven
[39:00] but at the same times you know it's
[39:02] they're got their way of living we do
[39:05] and everybody does and
[39:07] so it just it touched my heart to think
[39:10] because you see there's the gospel that
[39:13] does something to you
[39:16] you can either wash it away or you can
[39:19] cause yourself to have to do something
[39:21] about what you heard it'll make you
[39:24] repent it'll make you shout happy it'll
[39:27] make you know that there's a battle on
[39:29] that you know there's a heaven to gain
[39:31] and a hell to shun and the thing of it
[39:34] is but there's also a spirit that tries
[39:37] to drive you from that presence of God
[39:40] and that's what I I wonder about our
[39:44] minds and about our lives and I'm
[39:47] talking I trust about you and about me
[39:51] I want to be moved by the power and
[39:54] presence of God
[39:56] when people are in the house I want to
[39:59] do whatever I can do
[40:01] I want to come prepared I want to be a
[40:05] believer in God I want to be a believer
[40:08] in the gospel I come here now not only
[40:10] hear the gospel but I come to share the
[40:13] life of the Gospel to you already
[40:16] because you should have came to church
[40:18] already with your light already burning
[40:22] and the past of God that God give us
[40:24] what a difference it ought to make to
[40:27] our life and uh looking at some of them
[40:31] young women it seemed like a lot of them
[40:33] on Sunday morning I think to myself I
[40:36] wonder if the presence of God really
[40:38] gets to them to really cause a change to
[40:42] happen to their life
[40:44] and you write would you like to know how
[40:46] I know a lot of that is because
[40:49] I got the problem what I want I want
[40:52] more of God I want the verse that I have
[40:56] in Christ
[40:57] I want to manifest myself in him can you
[41:01] say Amen
[41:03] and so as we look at the word of God
[41:05] this morning I thought about myself you
[41:07] know many years ago I turned 21 years
[41:10] old and
[41:11] that's about the time of year all the
[41:14] bars are open to you and all you could
[41:16] do and I was going to my dad's church
[41:19] and I thought to myself that night I
[41:22] thought boy want to get through this my
[41:24] birthday's next day
[41:26] I'm going to hit them bars I'm going to
[41:29] hit them Liquors and gonna do that
[41:32] but I looked up and I told him whatever
[41:35] happens to me I want to make Heaven my
[41:38] home father
[41:41] I believe I love him above all my
[41:43] failure
[41:45] come on
[41:46] I believe God Loves Me Above All My
[41:50] failure
[41:51] so I can talk to him whether I'm
[41:53] succeeding or failure
[41:56] and I have to apologize from my wrong
[41:59] and I'm grateful for my right but I
[42:02] believe in him who calls me you know and
[42:05] I
[42:06] I told the Lord and I got getting strict
[42:09] and in my hands started going up and I
[42:11] began to step out in the middle of that
[42:13] congregation
[42:15] and the touch of God I said that uh
[42:17] forget what all I said but as I was in
[42:20] prayer I turned around like this and
[42:23] down the aisle of that church came a
[42:25] pyramid not a pyramid but a
[42:29] whirlwind
[42:30] and I've got to watch in that world win
[42:33] and it had suitcases in it it had straw
[42:37] a lot of stuff in it
[42:38] but all my life I took it at that
[42:41] Whirlwind always swept over me
[42:45] and took the uncleanness from my life
[42:47] and made me different
[42:51] can I hear an amen
[42:53] amen I believe God lives
[42:56] I believe that he fills your heart and
[43:00] life which helps you to live better and
[43:03] more Freer
[43:05] he teaches you to pray
[43:07] and if you don't learn to pray you find
[43:10] out your prayers don't get answered like
[43:12] they should and a lot of things go on
[43:14] that's what we want to talk about
[43:16] tonight but ever since that age when I
[43:19] look back I see that
[43:22] Whirlwind coming by my life working on
[43:25] taking out of my life making me what God
[43:27] would have me to be
[43:29] and I think what a an Outreach that is
[43:33] to my life
[43:34] how many of you believe God loves you
[43:39] do you really believe that he loves you
[43:42] then how can you fail because he does
[43:45] love you we think sometimes because of
[43:48] our failure and because of certain
[43:50] things but that creates it but uh
[43:56] uh the thing that touched my heart was
[43:58] that I believe that we need to take what
[44:02] God has given us he not only give us
[44:04] desperation
[44:06] he gives us your excitements and when
[44:09] you turn these Pages a lot of people I
[44:12] don't know that they like these books
[44:14] anymore
[44:15] but you see it is the mouth of God
[44:19] and if I could say something to you
[44:21] truthfully just being honest
[44:23] and all my life I've read some of the
[44:26] weirdest things I've ever read in my
[44:29] life and never knew them
[44:31] how many of you read one of these and
[44:34] when you come to find out you don't
[44:36] remember any of it
[44:39] nobody
[44:42] well I'll tell you it's a good one you
[44:44] want to read
[44:45] and it's where our life is
[44:48] and I'm saying this to you tonight
[44:51] because I believe it's to my heart and
[44:54] life
[44:55] God gives you things to be thankful for
[44:59] when you don't get those you're not
[45:01] thankful for sometimes you bring your
[45:03] thankful for up he wants to know why
[45:07] but when he brings his thankfuls up and
[45:11] you know the power of God has delivered
[45:13] you has made you different and has made
[45:16] you reach out you know I remember when
[45:18] people were sick you may not pray for me
[45:21] but you'd Pat him you touch him you'd
[45:24] shake their hand and while you did you'd
[45:26] pray for him friends need to be moved
[45:29] today by the power of Satan that the
[45:32] power of God may fill our hearts and
[45:34] Minds that's the dream of my heart
[45:37] and uh as we look at life and look at
[45:41] things this morning what touched my
[45:44] heart was a lot of the things that God
[45:47] has done for us I I I don't know that
[45:51] he pays much attention to what we do to
[45:54] him
[45:55] and I got to invited to preach here
[45:59] uh several weeks ago and every time I'd
[46:02] come to church somebody preached my
[46:04] sermon
[46:05] and I I uh this uh
[46:10] my brother back here the other day
[46:12] running up and down here like this I
[46:13] thought wonder what will happen if I
[46:15] take off running because I used to take
[46:17] off running
[46:19] and then praise the Lord and and friends
[46:22] I'll tell you something honestly I do
[46:25] not believe
[46:26] there's a greater power than the power
[46:28] of Jesus Christ
[46:31] you can go home as dry as you want or
[46:33] you can go home in Victory in your life
[46:37] I believe that with all my heart and you
[46:39] can answer have to answer it why you
[46:42] don't get Victory no more why you don't
[46:45] get to disturb by that how can you
[46:48] listen to me say things and have them
[46:50] not bother you
[46:52] how can he get happy and not me how can
[46:56] he not shout and not saying how can he
[46:59] not do these I say the same maybe to you
[47:01] what's touching their life I want to see
[47:05] Christ in you operating towards your
[47:08] life I know that we've got a children's
[47:11] or sick baby's got problems parents got
[47:15] wives husbands and everything else but I
[47:18] know someone that's greater than all of
[47:20] them amen in his name is the Lord Jesus
[47:24] Christ how many of you know him and the
[47:27] reason we don't know him right because
[47:30] we don't look into him
[47:32] like we really ought to look and that's
[47:34] what I want to talk to you about if I
[47:36] can and my wording and everything is
[47:39] correct that God has done these things
[47:42] for us and you know there's a Rapture at
[47:46] hand
[47:48] is that right
[47:49] amen one of these days it's gonna happen
[47:54] and you're not going to know it or
[47:56] you're going to be gone
[47:58] people talk about dying a Christian
[48:01] Never Dies
[48:04] amen because he has already passed from
[48:07] Death unto life
[48:09] I don't care how many times we have
[48:11] excuses for that it is the truth
[48:14] he died for me he lives for me amen and
[48:18] if anything happens to me I'm on my way
[48:20] to glory amen and when the time comes
[48:24] I'm going to come back we ought to get
[48:25] thrilled about the move of God in our
[48:28] our lives I'm not being critical
[48:32] I'm just looking to people about allow
[48:35] those things in their life
[48:38] and one of the things that touched my
[48:41] heart
[48:42] I guess and you all probably have read
[48:45] many of them or came to him as a
[48:47] squirrel Story by Brother Branham
[48:51] and uh
[48:53] you know a lot of things that when you
[48:55] follow brother bran a lot of things
[48:57] touched his heart
[48:58] but when I I read this he's talking to
[49:02] the Lord in one place he said Lord why
[49:04] don't you
[49:06] send me that
[49:07] uh squirrel
[49:10] and he says God hey my squirrels
[49:14] and he's there talking to God about the
[49:17] squirrels that he got from God but they
[49:19] weren't from God they were because he
[49:21] believed in God
[49:23] and when you believe in things that you
[49:25] get from God they come from God not from
[49:27] you through God to God
[49:30] and as I read this he wants to know how
[49:33] do I get
[49:35] your God down and now he's explaining
[49:37] how it is that it's not really my god
[49:41] when under the anointing of God you ask
[49:44] me to send some doves back or some
[49:47] squirrels back down this is that true
[49:49] and that's the same way when you or I
[49:51] your own voice will cause God to come
[49:54] and do Mighty things among us or you can
[49:57] go home tonight just as bad as you came
[49:59] here or you can go here happy
[50:02] amen it's unto you how many of you have
[50:05] been born again we've been born again
[50:07] and it leaves up to you I'm not going
[50:10] home that way Lord you know who I am you
[50:13] know who I am and he'll change your life
[50:17] so as I looked over Sunday service I
[50:20] thought about
[50:23] or
[50:24] brother and I thought about him asking
[50:28] for these squirrels he said you know he
[50:31] said I rubbed my eyes and I look back I
[50:33] turned to see my head and I thought I
[50:36] don't want to shoot that you know he's
[50:38] there and he's among some trees and
[50:42] brother Brown said every time he walks
[50:45] through those trees he thanks the Lord
[50:47] for him
[50:48] how many of you thank the Lord for the
[50:51] privilege of being in a place that
[50:53] you're hunting or a place that you're
[50:55] doing something from God
[50:58] and you ought to owe him a thank you
[51:00] like today I'm thankful that I'm in the
[51:03] house of God better than I'm in a bar
[51:05] somewhere
[51:06] and if you'll help me Lord I'll heal
[51:09] I'll hear the right words that will
[51:12] bless your mind or my mind and will
[51:14] change my heart
[51:16] oh Lord I I I I'm missing all them
[51:20] squirrels I'm missing them Lord I don't
[51:23] have them
[51:25] you're the one that got the squirrels
[51:28] and so then all of a sudden he begins to
[51:31] say to the squirrels I want you to come
[51:33] down that mountain
[51:34] I want you to come across that I want
[51:37] you to jump up in that tree over there
[51:39] and I want you to wait there till I
[51:41] shoot him
[51:43] and so he's thinking God is not going to
[51:45] hear him but when he looks up you know
[51:47] what he sees he sees the little the the
[51:51] squirrel coming down the mountain
[51:53] he watches him he jumps over there and
[51:56] he put him to jumps in a in a place that
[51:59] had crops that covered it and ordinarily
[52:03] a squirrel would never land in a tree
[52:05] like that but that tree grew up there
[52:07] and he looked at that and he threw that
[52:09] gun he said God I don't want to shoot a
[52:12] vision but he took his gun and shot that
[52:15] thing and down he came
[52:18] and when I got to thinking about that I
[52:21] I got to thinking about our blessings
[52:25] imagine being empowered by God
[52:28] looking on vision and not using any of
[52:31] God's leadership to get you there
[52:35] you know I said when I walked home with
[52:37] a request to meet at this day
[52:40] I thought dear God I am going to find
[52:45] you
[52:46] I'm going to have myself a a wonderful
[52:50] time with the King of Kings and the Lord
[52:53] of lords
[52:54] and I want to kneel down and I want to
[52:57] raise my hands I want to tell him that
[53:00] I'm moved upon because
[53:03] that's
[53:04] animal landed that thing in the tree and
[53:08] if he can do that by a prayer that
[53:10] something already happened how many of
[53:12] you got saved how many of your kids got
[53:15] saved how many your husbands got saved
[53:17] how many how many promises do you have
[53:21] and they're all God's promises and it
[53:24] ought to be when you look up you see the
[53:26] squirrel up there and you shoot him you
[53:28] ought to say well you know that's a
[53:29] promise that God paid attention to me a
[53:32] long time ago
[53:36] a long time ago he knew you
[53:39] long time ago he loved you
[53:42] long time ago he liked separate time
[53:44] with you
[53:45] you like to talk it over with you
[53:48] and you run yourself through him
[53:50] you talk to him because without that
[53:54] brothers and sisters he's got no reason
[53:56] to come he's got no reason to be
[53:58] thankful got no reason to be helpful and
[54:01] you say well Michael where do you get
[54:02] those words I get them from
[54:05] this
[54:07] and the thing of it is is as we begin
[54:10] before I move on with this story I
[54:13] wanted to tell you that what he did he
[54:16] just stayed in his position and he
[54:17] didn't ask for the rest of the squirrels
[54:21] and when you talk about the squirrels
[54:23] girl God would ask him
[54:26] but he just could not make up his mind
[54:28] what it is and I'm thinking he's got a
[54:31] power he's got a presence he's got a
[54:33] manifestation
[54:36] he's a prayer
[54:38] he's a singer he's a shouter he's uh and
[54:43] nobody raises her hand and hollers
[54:45] praise the Lord that's good
[54:50] because you see it
[54:52] you see there's something that's stir in
[54:54] somebody
[54:56] you are aware of a presence that's
[54:59] attaching somebody and by the grace of
[55:02] God I'm going to do something with that
[55:05] attachment
[55:07] huh
[55:09] I saw somebody shake his hands or
[55:12] something Sunday
[55:13] and all because he comes here every
[55:15] Sunday anyway
[55:17] and always seems like he's very much
[55:19] alive anybody would want to touch him
[55:22] and if it's God in him and making that
[55:25] man alive you ought to touch him
[55:27] when you look out and you see the women
[55:28] with their hands up like this you ought
[55:31] to say thank you Jesus they're touching
[55:33] God somehow I know what they're doing
[55:38] and I want to do the same thing Lord I
[55:41] want to enter that same presence
[55:44] praying we're not making up a game we're
[55:46] talking reality right here right now
[55:49] you're sitting here either whatever you
[55:52] know and you say well and I don't mean
[55:54] to be harsh but you say well I come in
[55:57] here and I've read two chapters in The
[55:59] Bible well have you ever taken one of
[56:01] these or read a chapter and have the
[56:03] word of God come alive for you
[56:06] God puts it all together for an
[56:09] understanding you know where you came
[56:11] from you know where you're at that's
[56:12] where we're at
[56:14] and I don't mean to be critical but I am
[56:17] trying to discuss these things today
[56:21] that that will touch our heart and life
[56:23] we know he lives people say to me
[56:26] sometimes well you know I'm looking for
[56:28] something to happen
[56:30] friends I am too
[56:32] how many of you were born with an
[56:34] appetite to want to see things maybe you
[56:37] wanted to have a lot of money
[56:39] maybe you wanted to have people like you
[56:42] and you did things all through your
[56:44] early days to grow up to that hour come
[56:48] to church and people know you because
[56:50] you got a good attitude
[56:53] this is the thing that we're talking
[56:55] about in our heart and life is what God
[56:58] has done to us and I believe that's what
[57:02] he's trying to fill our heart I believe
[57:04] there's a rapture
[57:06] but if God does certain things maybe I'm
[57:08] still living maybe God could still use
[57:10] me and then I know who he is
[57:14] and he knows who I am
[57:17] and for me to bow my knee down and raise
[57:19] my hands and say God I need to talk
[57:23] because I want to touch God that will
[57:26] touch my daughters
[57:29] I want to touch God that will touch my
[57:32] business
[57:34] isn't that what you want and well
[57:36] there's something to matter desperation
[57:39] has set in on you
[57:41] well that enemy has caused us to look
[57:45] around and what are we going to do but I
[57:48] heard the preacher say something about
[57:50] how a preacher got touched and God sent
[57:54] squirrels in boy if I could get like
[57:56] that my life would be changed if we
[57:59] could get like that we'd be shouting
[58:00] around here tonight imagine
[58:03] not critical just being honest with you
[58:08] so as we look at the word of God and I
[58:10] got some things I'd like to if I could
[58:12] read
[58:14] I believe that God planted us I believe
[58:16] God has delivered us and I believe that
[58:20] that see I believe people in young and
[58:23] old want to get deeper in God
[58:26] friends you want to know him you say
[58:28] he's a savior that he is he saved you
[58:32] before the foundation of the world
[58:34] he brought you forth under the power of
[58:36] God friends you need to get a little
[58:38] more picked on this thing you get a
[58:41] little more extraordinary how did he die
[58:43] how did he live how did all these things
[58:45] come on
[58:46] and I'd like to take and read a couple
[58:49] of these things here if I can to make
[58:52] you aware of this because what I'm
[58:55] really interested in and becoming more
[58:57] aware
[58:58] of actually what's happening even right
[59:01] now
[59:02] that I'm not being stirred
[59:06] I don't have a tear dripping down my
[59:08] cheek because I don't live like maybe I
[59:10] oughta I don't have a shout in my heart
[59:13] which ought to be there because of who I
[59:16] am
[59:18] and I think about people that would love
[59:20] to go into a vision and would see things
[59:25] from God in a vision
[59:27] and have God talk to you and of his own
[59:31] way I think that's exactly what we want
[59:33] to do in our own life I want to see him
[59:36] alive I want to see him moving on
[59:40] people's lives you say well brother Mike
[59:42] that's not but you see I'm going to read
[59:44] this and I'm going to tell you what he
[59:46] saw
[59:48] and I'm going to tell you something if
[59:49] you're not enthused about what you saw
[59:52] he'll never pay no attention to you
[59:55] you got to get excited because there is
[59:59] a real living God that loves you
[1:00:03] okay you believe that
[1:00:05] and if anybody's going to brag about it
[1:00:08] it ought to be me
[1:00:10] and it's it's uh I don't care it can
[1:00:13] help what people think and what I do I
[1:00:17] got issues in my life
[1:00:19] uh you might say and my wife and husband
[1:00:22] and everything else is going on what
[1:00:24] wouldn't I like a a real talk with God I
[1:00:28] I'd like to see what I could do to maybe
[1:00:31] bring a health
[1:00:33] to my family
[1:00:35] give my kids where they want to serve
[1:00:37] God give my wife to where she's happy
[1:00:39] get my husband to wear uh uh and and
[1:00:43] there's no desire we get to a place that
[1:00:46] that we just live like that
[1:00:48] and I believe that there ought to be a
[1:00:50] shout in this Camp there ought to be
[1:00:52] people under the anointing of the camp
[1:00:55] and uh I think that that whenever you
[1:01:00] get up and walk out of here in the
[1:01:01] morning I think sometimes in my prop you
[1:01:04] know it's it's tough to just to walk out
[1:01:07] of the house of God with the power of
[1:01:08] God in the house of God I lost into I
[1:01:11] listened to the singer
[1:01:13] and I mean he strains to get them songs
[1:01:16] out
[1:01:18] huh
[1:01:20] he may not think if I would know him I'd
[1:01:22] do my best to sing them along with you
[1:01:24] that one that you're saying tonight I've
[1:01:26] lived unto them all my life and easy to
[1:01:29] sing and easy to put the power to it
[1:01:31] easy to put the thrill within it that's
[1:01:33] what we're talking about here and when
[1:01:35] you get so enthused with God that's the
[1:01:37] way it is when you get up amen we begin
[1:01:40] to look for God and begin to see God
[1:01:42] moving and dealing in our our heart and
[1:01:45] life and I don't care how old you're
[1:01:47] getting or how else friends surely you
[1:01:50] got a deeper call surely there's
[1:01:52] something inside you that makes you want
[1:01:54] to be a real partner in the things that
[1:01:57] God has for us you tell me this church
[1:01:59] don't need partners
[1:02:00] you tell me this church don't need
[1:02:02] helpers you're telling me they don't
[1:02:05] need God aware
[1:02:06] it sure does and you say well how are
[1:02:09] you picking on them I'm just naturally
[1:02:12] we just learned to live a normal life
[1:02:15] I want to be on fire
[1:02:17] and if I'm saying wrong things may God
[1:02:20] help me to say them and a lot of things
[1:02:23] to say now remember this is
[1:02:26] a sermon that's called desperation
[1:02:29] and brother Brown starts out this he
[1:02:31] said
[1:02:32] the same thing as a token now I'm going
[1:02:35] to talk to you about a token how many of
[1:02:37] you got the token
[1:02:40] well that's not all
[1:02:42] that's not good
[1:02:45] because you need the token
[1:02:48] to prove that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:52] you say brother my how could I get that
[1:02:54] right now I don't know but if you get
[1:02:57] bothered enough I might want to turn
[1:02:59] right around sit right down or get down
[1:03:01] in that chair and raise these hands and
[1:03:04] tell God God you sent that and it's out
[1:03:08] here somewhere it ought to be coming to
[1:03:10] me today
[1:03:13] a lot of people today and and even in
[1:03:15] our Christian experience they were going
[1:03:17] back to some of my study in my reading
[1:03:21] and it's been many years 50 years of it
[1:03:24] at least
[1:03:26] and my brother was the one that first
[1:03:28] typing all these human brother Roy
[1:03:31] back East sermons
[1:03:34] but I want to read this to you here as
[1:03:37] part of this lutherans allowed it
[1:03:40] they just say you got the token how you
[1:03:43] doing you go to church you got the token
[1:03:46] but you see and we say the same thing
[1:03:48] until you get a revelation on what the
[1:03:50] token is
[1:03:52] it's a lot of things in church when you
[1:03:54] get a revelation in here with the power
[1:03:56] God touches your life and something
[1:03:57] would change you that fast I'll
[1:03:59] guarantee you God raise the dead change
[1:04:01] the life and change a lot of things in
[1:04:04] in people's lives
[1:04:06] he said accepting the word accepting
[1:04:08] Christ as a personal savior
[1:04:12] and you and the Methodist said well when
[1:04:15] you get happy enough to shout that's it
[1:04:19] and the Pentecost said speak in tongues
[1:04:22] I remember a few months ago brother you
[1:04:26] preached on tongues I believe in
[1:04:28] speaking in tongues
[1:04:30] I don't know about interpretation but
[1:04:32] when God comes by sometimes my heart
[1:04:34] just melts and I find a language that I
[1:04:38] can reach God to talk to him
[1:04:41] but the thing of it is as we read here
[1:04:44] spoken in tongues so people that speak
[1:04:47] in tongues or live that way you see
[1:04:49] that's what comes off of their life
[1:04:52] and we're talking about this life we're
[1:04:55] talking about something that God has set
[1:04:57] up the prophet of God you know and I I
[1:05:00] marked
[1:05:02] he's telling something on the church
[1:05:04] called the Hebrews book
[1:05:07] the Hebrews book
[1:05:09] was Paul
[1:05:10] but Darren brother branham's preaching
[1:05:14] he would he'd stand up and said and God
[1:05:16] said that he'd meet you
[1:05:19] and the thing of it is that all of a
[1:05:21] sudden people would stand up said how do
[1:05:23] you know that he won't
[1:05:25] and brother Brown said that's no one but
[1:05:27] God here at the age 33 years old and
[1:05:31] he's the one and he says he stood right
[1:05:34] there in the presence of that man that
[1:05:37] made that statement and talked to his
[1:05:39] Prophet for the hour and set the issue
[1:05:42] correctly
[1:05:43] and he said something else about the
[1:05:45] rock that the brother talked about the
[1:05:47] fountain in the rock and the man said in
[1:05:50] this saint Soul he was a churchgoer and
[1:05:53] all of a sudden that man about 30 years
[1:05:55] old which was he said no one less than
[1:05:58] God
[1:06:00] the voice of brother Branham said you
[1:06:02] telling me that God will come to uh
[1:06:08] wouldn't that be nice today
[1:06:11] have to know that for some reason God
[1:06:13] wants to hear what's going on here
[1:06:17] I'll tell you something you can't start
[1:06:19] living for God and getting up into God
[1:06:22] you're going to be a lot better than
[1:06:24] just paying your tithes
[1:06:26] it's going to be a real walk with God
[1:06:30] and as that's why I'm I'm reading this
[1:06:32] is that people claim well I speak in
[1:06:34] tongues that don't mean you got it
[1:06:38] and that's of course a lot of things
[1:06:39] that's being preached to our ears is
[1:06:42] that things are going on today that that
[1:06:46] that are not meeting the quota and I'm
[1:06:48] thinking dear God help us I I I don't
[1:06:52] know how to tell people all I can do is
[1:06:54] is tell them
[1:06:57] let me go on here because I believe
[1:06:59] anybody that knows brother branuman
[1:07:00] loves him and knows he was talking to
[1:07:02] God
[1:07:03] and talking to God about some squirrels
[1:07:05] talking to God about those things I
[1:07:08] believe that
[1:07:10] and you know what I'd say I say dear God
[1:07:12] I would sure like to do that now I don't
[1:07:15] know about squirrels but I would like a
[1:07:18] visitation girls is that not true
[1:07:22] wouldn't you like something to get a
[1:07:23] hold of you so much that you begin to
[1:07:25] see something that that and and you see
[1:07:29] here when you when you fall among that
[1:07:31] you'll see things that are unbelievable
[1:07:34] for you to see
[1:07:35] and it's God how many of you can look
[1:07:38] and see a devil or a naked woman on
[1:07:40] something nobody
[1:07:42] well believe it or not you can see them
[1:07:45] and the thing of it is you can either
[1:07:46] call it what it is
[1:07:48] or you can say I enjoy looking
[1:07:51] but I'm telling you what it's it's wrong
[1:07:54] and I'm telling you what we're talking
[1:07:56] about here about the things of God
[1:07:58] it says and you go to the railway and
[1:08:02] all of you probably have read this and
[1:08:05] you say well I want to go somewhere
[1:08:07] so what you have to do you have to buy a
[1:08:09] token
[1:08:10] so what you do is that you walk up and
[1:08:13] say I want to go to Chicago okay that'd
[1:08:16] be four hundred dollars
[1:08:19] okay here's the token
[1:08:21] so what he does he walks down the street
[1:08:23] and if somebody said where are you going
[1:08:26] what are you looking for I'm looking for
[1:08:27] the train from Chicago
[1:08:29] how do you know I got the token how you
[1:08:31] know where you're gonna sit I got the
[1:08:33] token when a guy goes up there with the
[1:08:35] 400 they can't take them
[1:08:38] so we have to so we find out here as we
[1:08:40] look at this the railway uh has paid and
[1:08:44] what they say it's all taken care of
[1:08:46] that's what the the man says I'll take
[1:08:48] you to Chicago I'll take you anywhere
[1:08:50] because now I got the token so when you
[1:08:53] got the token
[1:08:55] Brethren you got to Victory
[1:08:58] and if you don't have the token tonight
[1:09:00] if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you
[1:09:02] don't have the god in our life it's not
[1:09:05] what it ought to be and if I'm being
[1:09:06] critical please forgive me
[1:09:09] because you see in my heart I want to
[1:09:11] see miracles in God
[1:09:18] and the thing of it is is I'm telling
[1:09:21] you
[1:09:22] what the man you loved is the one that
[1:09:24] said this
[1:09:27] Indiana costs talking about that he said
[1:09:30] now the
[1:09:31] company puts a token so that see now
[1:09:35] things you do you go down and somebody
[1:09:38] purchases the fair going on with that
[1:09:42] he says give you the token that gives
[1:09:44] you the right on the rail till uh it's
[1:09:49] uh donation
[1:09:51] whatever the train goes it it gives
[1:09:54] that's what it does because it's got to
[1:09:56] talk of whatever the tree the train has
[1:09:59] got it gives to you then it follows here
[1:10:02] if the spirit of God dwells in you so
[1:10:05] does the power dwell in you it ought to
[1:10:07] heal the sick and ought to touch this it
[1:10:09] ought to touch that is that right
[1:10:11] if you can look around and see and look
[1:10:13] around and believe
[1:10:16] the case of the blood and the token
[1:10:18] literally
[1:10:20] how many of you know do you have the
[1:10:22] blood of Jesus Christ in your life
[1:10:26] and it has to be applied because it's
[1:10:30] otherwise it's just a chemistry so if
[1:10:32] you read it on the fall on the Bible or
[1:10:35] somewhere you say well that's just a
[1:10:37] chemistry I want the reality
[1:10:39] I want to touch you God I want the blood
[1:10:42] of Christ on me amen I I want what God's
[1:10:46] got for me
[1:10:47] and these things that we're being taught
[1:10:49] is what makes people come up with
[1:10:51] questions
[1:10:54] let me go on here and read it
[1:10:57] and it goes on to say and to make it a
[1:11:00] perfect one the whole judge in other
[1:11:02] words the whole judge come up God from
[1:11:04] Heaven become everything judge jury
[1:11:07] attorney hey
[1:11:09] and the words there where it came and it
[1:11:13] gives unto them
[1:11:15] eternal life so when you get that you
[1:11:17] get eternal life how many got eternal
[1:11:18] life
[1:11:21] he said now the Greek he said I know I'm
[1:11:23] talking to Scholars two or three and uh
[1:11:27] the word of God there is Zoe and that's
[1:11:30] God's own life God's own life and I will
[1:11:34] give unto him Zoe
[1:11:37] that's you and I God's own life
[1:11:43] of course they don't do nothing
[1:11:46] huh
[1:11:48] but it does
[1:11:51] it'll look through the clouds and look
[1:11:53] everywhere
[1:11:55] desperation sets in and you'll never
[1:11:57] touch it till you get desperate
[1:12:02] it says and in the life that was in
[1:12:04] Christ is the Holy Ghost uh not the
[1:12:08] third person it's the same person it's
[1:12:10] the same form over the holy ghost coming
[1:12:12] upon you as a token coming upon you as a
[1:12:16] token let me just
[1:12:19] stop that just a moment
[1:12:22] but what happens is is that people comes
[1:12:24] down here and they talk about I got
[1:12:26] tongues
[1:12:27] well he said you buy a pair of shoes
[1:12:30] and how many of you got a set of tongues
[1:12:33] in the right and left foot
[1:12:36] huh
[1:12:38] and so he's talking about after you're
[1:12:40] getting a foot that way
[1:12:42] and that's not the way God intended the
[1:12:44] foot to happen to you is it for you to
[1:12:47] put on a pair of shoes with a foot in it
[1:12:50] and the thing of it is is because he
[1:12:53] wants your life changed and made over
[1:12:55] like his
[1:12:57] and so as you begin to read this we
[1:12:59] begin to see that that God desired you
[1:13:03] and I to have in our life the things
[1:13:06] that God would have and I think to
[1:13:08] myself then Lord no more tongues for me
[1:13:12] no more that I'm not worried about shoe
[1:13:14] lasses anymore
[1:13:16] I'm not worried about this anymore
[1:13:18] whatever you type it about I want the
[1:13:22] Life of Christ I want a death burial
[1:13:25] Resurrection I want the overcoming
[1:13:27] conversation I want the victory place to
[1:13:30] me I want to walk with it talk with it
[1:13:33] Shout with it under the power of
[1:13:35] almighty God I don't care if you're
[1:13:37] young I don't care if you're old but
[1:13:39] that's the promise that way you can say
[1:13:41] I got the token
[1:13:44] and that's where God knows and if you
[1:13:47] look back here a little bit his Boy
[1:13:49] comes up his boy says Daddy I hear
[1:13:51] something he said that's why I got the
[1:13:54] lamb
[1:13:55] he said I couldn't hardly fight her but
[1:13:57] I bought the lamb here let me open the
[1:13:59] door blood all over everything on the
[1:14:01] door he said that's because he said
[1:14:03] either get the blood on that or there's
[1:14:06] going to be trouble and he said well
[1:14:08] Daddy well how come you're eating all
[1:14:09] that kind of food he said it's because
[1:14:12] he told me to eat this kind of food
[1:14:15] and so this the boy he's standing Daddy
[1:14:17] what am I going to do he said you're my
[1:14:19] son and because of my birth and because
[1:14:22] of what I'm doing and where I'm doing it
[1:14:24] now makes it all right that you're gonna
[1:14:27] make it too because it's all taken care
[1:14:29] of if you don't believe I'll open the
[1:14:31] door again you can look at the blood and
[1:14:33] when that death angel passes through
[1:14:35] that City he's going to see that blood
[1:14:37] when he Hollies your name he's going to
[1:14:40] see that chicken or whatever it is
[1:14:41] you're waving around in your hand
[1:14:43] there's going to be things going on
[1:14:45] desperation
[1:14:46] ought to tell us hey there ain't no
[1:14:48] chicken hey there ain't nothing
[1:14:51] happening
[1:14:56] I'd like to hear a little more amen
[1:14:59] but I'm being serious with you because I
[1:15:02] believe it tonight to be the truth and
[1:15:05] as you you move over into this he begins
[1:15:09] to prove your love
[1:15:11] and it's not the answer to everything
[1:15:13] there's other ones but what makes this
[1:15:16] this makes me God this gives me eternal
[1:15:19] life
[1:15:22] huh this this ought to put a uh unless
[1:15:27] you're cold or indifferent but if if you
[1:15:30] get excited it
[1:15:32] ought to say hey don't get tennis shoes
[1:15:34] like that with those tongues and those
[1:15:36] that and and that way get God in there
[1:15:39] let let God baptize you with the baptism
[1:15:42] of the Holy Ghost and the reason that
[1:15:45] you're baptized I don't know if there's
[1:15:47] anybody here today that has not been
[1:15:49] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:52] Christ if I was you I'd make a track as
[1:15:55] close as I could to get that thing done
[1:15:58] in our life amen I want to make sure
[1:16:01] it's not father son Holy Ghost I want to
[1:16:03] make sure it's not something else I want
[1:16:05] these things done correctly
[1:16:07] and you say why brother Mike because you
[1:16:10] see something
[1:16:12] that's why I'm preaching this I think
[1:16:16] and I listened to my brother preach
[1:16:18] Sunday
[1:16:19] talking about the kingdom and the power
[1:16:21] and presence of God and how the god
[1:16:24] deals with people and I I think that's
[1:16:27] what we're talking about and if anybody
[1:16:30] wants to be that way I do
[1:16:33] honestly I do
[1:16:37] I want to see something different
[1:16:39] I want to
[1:16:40] see something here we got 400 people in
[1:16:43] here bound to have sick people bound to
[1:16:45] have problems bound to have issues bound
[1:16:48] to need God
[1:16:49] bound to need him
[1:16:52] and then your family and these ladies
[1:16:55] I'm not talking about them but Sonny
[1:16:57] there's a lot of women in here and I
[1:17:01] asked myself God do they are are they
[1:17:04] aware of what's happening are they aware
[1:17:06] there's a Resurrection coming as
[1:17:09] Anything could happen at any time we
[1:17:12] ought to stay alert
[1:17:15] amen and the thing of it is is that
[1:17:18] reading this you go from
[1:17:21] what he's talking about here and you
[1:17:23] begin to move on here
[1:17:25] desperation and then you work on
[1:17:28] desperation all of a sudden you begin to
[1:17:30] change and you get that you say well I
[1:17:32] love them but you can tell people don't
[1:17:34] love people
[1:17:37] when you love people God knows you love
[1:17:39] them when you love God God knows it amen
[1:17:43] and I think the world whatever it is
[1:17:45] that we need more of the love of God
[1:17:48] it's not that we're in love with the
[1:17:49] neighbor kid or whatever it is we're
[1:17:51] talking to God Amen when you love him
[1:17:54] you depart from those other issues
[1:17:57] you could you can talk honestly it's
[1:18:00] it's legitimate
[1:18:02] and brother Branham you know he goes on
[1:18:04] and he says Lord he said I got a second
[1:18:07] squirrel
[1:18:09] and he said he belongs right down there
[1:18:12] he said I don't have no squirrel
[1:18:15] he said just say the word
[1:18:17] and he's saying now here's another thing
[1:18:20] that I want to jar you with
[1:18:22] is that he's moved upon this
[1:18:27] don't have nothing
[1:18:29] talking to God about squirrel
[1:18:31] and God says to him he said well you
[1:18:34] remember when you was hunting
[1:18:36] and you remember when you said in the
[1:18:39] name of the Lord let that squirrel come
[1:18:40] down through there
[1:18:42] and you did something or whatever it is
[1:18:44] that you did
[1:18:46] so don't say about looking at a new one
[1:18:48] for me
[1:18:49] he said because it's already there
[1:18:53] and he looked up there and there come
[1:18:54] that squirrel down there and he jumped
[1:18:56] there with uh with uh
[1:18:59] can't not cancer but uh sometime if you
[1:19:02] touched it you get a disease on you
[1:19:05] I can't hear you
[1:19:08] and the thing of it was he said God a
[1:19:11] squirrel Will Never Land in that
[1:19:12] atmosphere
[1:19:14] because it's it's contaminated with a
[1:19:17] lot of stuff and down that root Mountain
[1:19:19] come that squirrel made that turn went
[1:19:22] over here jumped up in there among all
[1:19:24] those weeds and all that stuff and he
[1:19:26] stood there and brother Brown said I
[1:19:28] can't shoot him he's a virgin
[1:19:33] and I say boy if I could just get that
[1:19:36] deep enough
[1:19:38] my prayer life
[1:19:40] would come so much real
[1:19:42] huh and I would say Lord I gotta talk
[1:19:46] I'm not wearing no more of these tennis
[1:19:48] shoes
[1:19:50] I'm changing
[1:19:52] I'm meaning God and the thing of it is
[1:19:54] is that we begin and he looks at that
[1:19:57] and
[1:19:58] and he thinks to himself so the
[1:20:01] conversation goes off he takes his rifle
[1:20:03] and shoots that
[1:20:05] squirrel
[1:20:07] he said I looked up and saw his eyes
[1:20:09] were black he shot him always always in
[1:20:12] the world
[1:20:13] in the eye
[1:20:15] and so he goes on about his business and
[1:20:18] he's bye bye to God
[1:20:21] and all of a sudden God speaks up to him
[1:20:24] he said hey you asked for three
[1:20:29] and I would ask you hey you that's
[1:20:32] running home didn't you ask God to talk
[1:20:35] to you
[1:20:38] and you might say well brother Mike you
[1:20:41] know we don't maybe we just need to get
[1:20:43] out or all I'm telling you is that's
[1:20:46] what God Said you require three of them
[1:20:49] and now you're getting in the car with
[1:20:51] two of them and what's the problem
[1:20:55] okay so I'm telling you you said you
[1:20:59] like to get deeper and dips in the power
[1:21:03] of God now I don't know where that's
[1:21:04] going to take you
[1:21:06] but there is a God that can make you
[1:21:08] ready for the hour I don't know how many
[1:21:11] of you tonight where the Holy Ghost have
[1:21:12] got troubles how many of you got maybe
[1:21:15] one or two
[1:21:17] not a few troubles attitude sometimes I
[1:21:20] got problems along some of those lines
[1:21:23] and I'm looking at that and we're living
[1:21:26] for God we come and go as we please and
[1:21:29] all the time would bother me and I
[1:21:30] wanted to say that if they fill a whole
[1:21:32] house
[1:21:33] let us not go home without talking to
[1:21:36] God about the need in our lives and the
[1:21:39] requests that we have wouldn't that be
[1:21:41] wonderful
[1:21:42] amen I don't care you don't
[1:21:45] to me it's not money
[1:21:47] you can get money anywhere
[1:21:49] but it's him
[1:21:51] and the young ladies you need to talk to
[1:21:54] somebody that knows tomorrow talk to him
[1:21:57] you know there's a man somewhere or a
[1:21:59] lady I got girls I got four girls
[1:22:03] and the thing is I say the same thing
[1:22:06] that that looking for God to be for what
[1:22:09] God would be and I've been a roofer all
[1:22:12] my life and uh but my life has been my
[1:22:17] desire is to know God better
[1:22:19] than anything else and that's all my
[1:22:22] reading I've read you need the token you
[1:22:24] need the token you need the token but
[1:22:26] it's like this man's boy went home and
[1:22:28] said hey Daddy
[1:22:29] you know
[1:22:31] things have changed so let me move on
[1:22:33] again he says well who said what are you
[1:22:35] going to do he said it ain't mine
[1:22:39] so he
[1:22:40] goes up there and he gets that third
[1:22:43] squirrel again
[1:22:45] and he takes it home with him in a
[1:22:47] couple days later
[1:22:50] he's talking about him and and I hope
[1:22:53] I'm not insulting you
[1:22:56] but he's talking about these him doing
[1:22:59] this I asked God about the squirrels
[1:23:03] well brother burning them you know being
[1:23:06] who you are sir
[1:23:08] you should have just Zapped it
[1:23:11] no no no I had a something on me
[1:23:15] what turned God to do something about
[1:23:18] what I was doing
[1:23:21] or to me I have to answer these
[1:23:24] questions to myself how many of you
[1:23:26] talked to God and all of a sudden you
[1:23:28] have to turn around and start talking to
[1:23:31] God
[1:23:32] and he'll tell you that well the reason
[1:23:34] the problem of it is you're not really
[1:23:36] interested and if the problem was here's
[1:23:38] what you do about it and if you ask what
[1:23:40] you will it will be finished
[1:23:43] well Lord you say that then why don't
[1:23:45] you believe what I said I'll tell you
[1:23:47] why you don't believe what I said
[1:23:49] and first thing you know we get educated
[1:23:52] and I'm saying this if this church can
[1:23:55] realize
[1:23:56] the request that's on your heart
[1:23:59] that is yet to be touched
[1:24:02] and you're when a win is ever going to
[1:24:04] happen
[1:24:06] and I'm saying those things for me when
[1:24:08] are you going to touch my little girl
[1:24:10] back in
[1:24:11] back back way back when are you gonna
[1:24:14] touch this one down here I I don't know
[1:24:16] Lord
[1:24:18] but you know I got a right to talk to
[1:24:20] God
[1:24:21] like we're talking I don't want to be
[1:24:23] able to leave the presence of God
[1:24:25] without me talking to God Amen and I'm
[1:24:28] not interested in a dollar bill I'm
[1:24:31] interested in the Revival I'm interested
[1:24:34] in getting God in my life he saved me I
[1:24:37] want to be a savior I want to be a
[1:24:39] Christian I want to be what God would
[1:24:41] have me to be I want to come into a
[1:24:43] church with a thousand people on it and
[1:24:46] shake hands with people and pray for
[1:24:47] them while I'm shaking and they may not
[1:24:49] ever know it but by the power of God God
[1:24:52] will heal them anyway for it
[1:24:59] so he's thinking about this as we would
[1:25:02] think why don't God do this why don't
[1:25:04] God do that why would God say that why
[1:25:07] would God say that that's why I
[1:25:09] mentioned to you today about while he's
[1:25:11] having a business saying a man walks in
[1:25:14] about 33 years old and says
[1:25:18] if you were knowing god you'd know who
[1:25:21] it was and sure enough it was God
[1:25:23] standing there telling William Branham
[1:25:26] that it was the truth and uh a lot of
[1:25:30] those things could go on God could stay
[1:25:32] with us during the day and never know it
[1:25:34] if you weren't careful
[1:25:36] okay
[1:25:38] so anyway as we begin to read and I
[1:25:41] looked around and I said God that was
[1:25:43] you and I said I I thank you for this
[1:25:46] now I'll go on out
[1:25:49] and he said well he said don't you doubt
[1:25:53] what you say you say you get three
[1:25:56] that's where that they'll be there the
[1:25:59] next time
[1:26:00] he said and I thought well if I'm
[1:26:03] Dreaming I'm going to continue to dream
[1:26:10] okay so he goes home with his problem
[1:26:13] so I said today I picked out the old
[1:26:17] pass over there of the trees and there
[1:26:20] was a wrapped up in that poison oak and
[1:26:24] he said you never get a squirrel in
[1:26:26] poison oak so I said the next one will
[1:26:29] come right out here Poison Ivy and uh
[1:26:32] set that young squirrel looking right at
[1:26:36] me and he said I set my gun down and he
[1:26:39] said I rubbed my eyes I turned around
[1:26:41] again I thought there it is he said turn
[1:26:45] his head sideways and I shot the
[1:26:48] squirrel and uh
[1:26:50] the squirrel died but said you said he
[1:26:54] said you said three
[1:26:55] and he's going over this let me just
[1:26:57] skip it but I don't know how long we've
[1:26:59] been
[1:27:01] but he's out there with a meeting with
[1:27:04] some people sister Hattie Wright
[1:27:08] and the family was the one that made the
[1:27:12] wine for communion
[1:27:15] and so he's out for a couple days trying
[1:27:17] to figure out why in the world these
[1:27:20] things would happen to him like they did
[1:27:24] and he walks in there and she's making a
[1:27:26] cheese a chili cobbler for him
[1:27:29] and she said I like us
[1:27:31] rabbit if you could he said I'll get him
[1:27:34] right now went out and shot the rabbit
[1:27:36] brought him in sat down to eat and they
[1:27:38] shot indeedy all of a sudden he stands
[1:27:41] up you know what I don't understand
[1:27:44] he said there's your sister over here
[1:27:46] needs a healing
[1:27:47] here's this issue over here needs this
[1:27:50] he said and the thing of it is he said I
[1:27:54] can't figure out about those three
[1:27:55] squirrels
[1:27:57] now everybody sat there because they
[1:28:00] didn't know what was going on is that
[1:28:01] right
[1:28:02] he said sister how do you write whatever
[1:28:04] you would say
[1:28:06] he said now you know your daughter needs
[1:28:08] a healing but he knew her life wasn't
[1:28:11] going to be long I don't know what all
[1:28:12] the situation was
[1:28:15] but all of a sudden he turns up to God
[1:28:17] and he said what I need sir is my boys
[1:28:20] need salvation
[1:28:24] she said well how could he say that is
[1:28:26] because the leadership of God put the
[1:28:28] request on him
[1:28:31] and the thing of it was it it moved
[1:28:33] Brethren Branham for the for that
[1:28:36] because those boys immediately and you
[1:28:39] know if you read this the deal they
[1:28:41] immediately surrendered their life to
[1:28:44] Christ
[1:28:45] and the thing of it was is that he was
[1:28:48] bothered with the thought and when he
[1:28:51] brought up the prying or the questioning
[1:28:53] she gave an answer to what she's
[1:28:56] bothered by and God answered her father
[1:29:01] and I think about yourself and mine I
[1:29:03] think dear God that's what I need I need
[1:29:06] this man to get a few things
[1:29:08] straightened out more so than worried
[1:29:10] about getting everything else
[1:29:12] straightened out
[1:29:14] he said well even Abraham
[1:29:17] brought his boy up to the top of the
[1:29:20] mountain
[1:29:21] he said Jehovah Jireh
[1:29:24] he called him Jehovah Jireh
[1:29:31] where would you think of that somebody
[1:29:33] called you Jehovah Jireh
[1:29:35] I never saw him in my life how would I
[1:29:38] know who he is
[1:29:40] so he tells his boy
[1:29:42] he said that I got off of you as a
[1:29:45] sacrifice but then all of a sudden the
[1:29:48] manifestation of the Jehovah
[1:29:51] displayed itself and they searched over
[1:29:54] the mountain to find their sheep and
[1:29:55] couldn't find any
[1:29:57] and all of a sudden when he looked
[1:29:59] around for a moment there was that sheep
[1:30:02] took his boy off the altar brought the
[1:30:05] Sheep down there did the thing that God
[1:30:08] I say today if we would touch God and
[1:30:11] were moved upon by God by the things
[1:30:14] that's touching Our Lives what a
[1:30:16] difference it ought to make in our life
[1:30:19] amen if God hears our requests what a
[1:30:22] change we begin to make in our life and
[1:30:25] my time's running out but what you do is
[1:30:28] is that you live imagine knowing people
[1:30:31] you're sitting here and you say well I
[1:30:34] got a problem
[1:30:36] and you say Lord It's not that it's me
[1:30:38] or somebody a preacher will stand up
[1:30:40] here and maybe he'll say something to
[1:30:43] you and then you'll answer the question
[1:30:45] well my real problem is not worried
[1:30:47] about those squirrels
[1:30:49] I gotta touch God for something else
[1:30:52] dang
[1:30:54] friends how many of you really know how
[1:30:56] sharp he is
[1:31:00] and how he lived and how he lives today
[1:31:03] to take care of you or I
[1:31:06] and to return the pages we can tell you
[1:31:08] more about the same things that happen
[1:31:12] and what you're here tonight
[1:31:14] you hear me telling you about something
[1:31:16] that you're thinking about you can
[1:31:18] either regard it or you can pass it away
[1:31:21] may God help us today to realize
[1:31:24] one of the first things I think we ought
[1:31:26] to look at it's time to go home
[1:31:29] and you better get right
[1:31:31] it's time to set up if there's issues
[1:31:33] take them out and you could do here
[1:31:37] that's page five
[1:31:39] okay we turn over here to page seven you
[1:31:42] ought to hear it
[1:31:43] and then all of a sudden something else
[1:31:46] happens on page 13.
[1:31:48] and the thing of it is is because people
[1:31:51] are unaware of what's going on around
[1:31:52] about them
[1:31:54] and all I'm telling you today is is that
[1:31:57] God wants to do things for us
[1:32:01] and you say Amen to that
[1:32:03] I mean how many of you
[1:32:05] are open to the door that want to hear
[1:32:07] God tell you something
[1:32:13] no matter how many people fill the
[1:32:15] building or how many is not over the
[1:32:17] building it's between you and him
[1:32:19] you love him
[1:32:21] you tell him now
[1:32:23] you say well if he could hear me friends
[1:32:26] he hears
[1:32:28] so you're telling Lord I love you with
[1:32:30] all my heart sir
[1:32:33] do you know it
[1:32:35] and you look at the word of God he tells
[1:32:37] you will
[1:32:38] he said you know if you want your wife
[1:32:40] to love you you tell your wife you love
[1:32:42] her
[1:32:43] and then you set out with her sometimes
[1:32:46] at the table and you start making love
[1:32:49] to her
[1:32:52] is she becoming more convinced or not
[1:32:56] she thou would say man are you
[1:33:00] in love with me
[1:33:02] and I know that but he said it I didn't
[1:33:04] say it
[1:33:06] that's what a man does a man does and
[1:33:08] and does that and she sits there until
[1:33:11] she actually something happened to him
[1:33:13] well what happened to you well I've
[1:33:15] heard if I didn't start doing better I
[1:33:18] may not ever have a wife here
[1:33:20] and if I didn't start paying attention
[1:33:22] the way things were going on in my life
[1:33:24] things may not be just like they ought
[1:33:27] to be here
[1:33:29] you know how carnal Mike how cold and
[1:33:32] different to have something like that
[1:33:36] I don't care how dead it sounds
[1:33:40] it feel
[1:33:42] when somebody comes by and says hey
[1:33:45] you're looking good
[1:33:46] just say thank you
[1:33:48] when they come by with the criticism you
[1:33:51] say oh I'll try and do different
[1:33:53] and all through the Bible that and and
[1:33:56] these books that you begin to read still
[1:33:58] definition and Elijah were talking about
[1:34:01] and things that he did and things that
[1:34:04] he followed God may it be the same when
[1:34:08] God did certain things I was there
[1:34:11] huh
[1:34:13] here we are today and I say in the name
[1:34:15] of Jesus Christ you know what he did
[1:34:18] he told Israel he said now when you when
[1:34:23] uh the king comes over here he's going
[1:34:25] to take you all home all back to Babylon
[1:34:29] but he said after you're there for 70
[1:34:31] years Elijah or not Elijah but Joshua
[1:34:35] could be wrong on that
[1:34:37] he said you tell those people
[1:34:40] at 70 years old I'm going to turn them
[1:34:43] loose
[1:34:44] and they're going to come back
[1:34:46] and when they come back I'm going to
[1:34:48] send you after them
[1:34:50] I mean have you take them back to their
[1:34:52] land
[1:34:54] and I said to myself you imagine a man
[1:34:57] knowing
[1:34:58] that a Cane's going to take you 70 years
[1:35:01] there
[1:35:03] and the promise is given to you in 70
[1:35:06] years I'm going to send him back to you
[1:35:09] and Jeremiah is going to be there to
[1:35:12] make sure if you go past it I'll find
[1:35:15] you and I'll send you back but I'm going
[1:35:17] to guarantee you I'm going to take you
[1:35:19] back home children
[1:35:22] now that's a pretty good answer
[1:35:26] you said well that's 70 years old
[1:35:28] brother Mike you know it don't make no
[1:35:30] difference
[1:35:31] this is home
[1:35:34] may God help us
[1:35:36] amen be touched by the feelings that we
[1:35:39] have in our life
[1:35:41] amen we look too much to man I think I
[1:35:44] do
[1:35:45] and a doctor told me you're going to die
[1:35:48] I said well
[1:35:52] I don't mean to be nasty but
[1:35:55] I serve a living Christ
[1:35:58] and I know he can pick up an ash and
[1:36:00] make something out of it he can make my
[1:36:02] life different
[1:36:04] as far as I know I've been a year
[1:36:05] instead of a month alive
[1:36:07] and said of the things that's going on
[1:36:10] nothing's going on I can't talk too good
[1:36:12] that I got a pastor who loves me
[1:36:15] I got life behind us
[1:36:18] you know that that help us you know if
[1:36:22] you listen to brother Ron he'll tell you
[1:36:24] what he did as a young man because it
[1:36:26] serves
[1:36:28] something to his life
[1:36:31] could I hear you say something that may
[1:36:33] serve to your life
[1:36:35] we get together sometimes and don't say
[1:36:38] nothing like that it's just uh
[1:36:40] but then I just say you got no problem
[1:36:42] you got tennis shoes on you got a nice
[1:36:44] looking pair of shoes and socks and
[1:36:46] everything else you'd be better off
[1:36:49] without it
[1:36:50] so I want to turn the service back to
[1:36:54] whoever's supposed to get it may God
[1:36:56] bless you may you look ladies gentlemen
[1:36:59] whoever you are may you strive at home
[1:37:02] go in and shut the door whatever God
[1:37:05] God I wanted to meet you now I'm going
[1:37:08] to meet you in heaven but is there a
[1:37:11] chance that I could see you here
[1:37:15] could you make my wife feel better could
[1:37:18] she make a little better
[1:37:20] we got babies out here crying changing
[1:37:23] friend all you need is one look
[1:37:27] all's well
[1:37:29] bang it just takes place
[1:37:31] may it help you may your life get shook
[1:37:33] like
[1:37:34] Hannah's did
[1:37:36] you mean to tell me I'm released he said
[1:37:39] yes what would you say
[1:37:41] and she said I want my boys as far as I
[1:37:44] know they're still saved God bless you
[1:37:47] would you stand with me please
[1:37:59] amen
[1:38:01] you see when you hear those stories
[1:38:05] and there's something about it and it
[1:38:08] stirs your heart
[1:38:09] how do you write
[1:38:12] she believed what he was saying
[1:38:16] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:38:24] and that pleased God
[1:38:28] what about your life
[1:38:31] what about something that you could say
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:35] I know that God is real
[1:38:38] I know what God has done in this hour I
[1:38:41] know he said he lied to the prophet I've
[1:38:43] heard his voice
[1:38:45] and I know it's nothing
[1:38:48] but the truth
[1:38:51] amen and I don't have to try to figure
[1:38:53] it out I don't have to try to debate it

[1:39:15] choosing a bride

[1:39:41] those State boys got and played the tape
[1:39:43] for him and he said oh my
[1:39:46] I didn't realize it
[1:39:48] I would like to see more and more that
[1:39:51] the men that stand behind this Pulpit
[1:39:54] have the anointing of God so strong upon
[1:39:59] him that it's no longer them speaking
[1:40:01] but it's God speaking through them and
[1:40:04] we see more of the Supernatural and we
[1:40:07] see things happening in our lives huh
[1:40:10] somebody say Amen because that I desire
[1:40:14] it
