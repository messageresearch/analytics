[34:23] with maias tomorrow morning early for
[34:25] breakfast and and uh praise the Lord now
[34:29] last Sunday I preached on stepping into
[34:31] the
[34:32] vision and uh we had quite a time with a
[34:35] Brothers on Monday morning listen I got
[34:37] there just five minutes before 7 they
[34:40] already had they had quotes out they
[34:42] were underlining they were hammering the
[34:45] table these guys were were yeah they
[34:49] were ready to go and it was a quite a
[34:52] blessing then I thought well you know
[34:54] what I wanted to do is just to kind of
[34:56] take that a little bit further and uh I
[35:00] wanted to show you in the scripture of
[35:02] that event actually happening so I want
[35:06] you to turn with me if you would in your
[35:07] Bibles a little lengthy reading but
[35:09] that's good uh Genesis chap
[35:13] 24 Genesis chapter 24 and I wanted to
[35:16] say until U sister Melody Weeden and
[35:20] Angela that their Brother David got with
[35:23] me yesterday the Lord uh uh he he said
[35:27] brother Ron this is the little
[35:28] red-haired boy of uh the youngest son of
[35:32] of James and and Melody and and I've got
[35:35] some questions and I said oh well hey
[35:37] praise the Lord and he said look I don't
[35:39] want to debate I don't want an argument
[35:41] or anything like that and I said hey
[35:42] look uh if you've got questions we come
[35:45] here I'm not a theologian he because he
[35:47] asked me what did you go to a School of
[35:49] Theology and I said no I went to a
[35:51] school of
[35:53] neology and I said listen um you know uh
[35:58] I'm not an answer man but I said if you
[36:01] have a
[36:02] question um that actually comes from the
[36:05] scripture because I said let's let's if
[36:07] we're going to talk about something I
[36:09] said the word of God let's establish one
[36:11] thing and that is God's word is our
[36:14] absolute I said because a prophet comes
[36:17] back and reveals to you the things from
[36:20] the word that's right okay so I said if
[36:22] it's uh you know just Theology and you
[36:26] want to know you know is Buddha God is
[36:29] Islam right you know who's right and
[36:31] everything hey uh you know we're not and
[36:35] anyway had a wonderful time amen
[36:38] wonderful time prise God and just going
[36:40] back to the scripture and I told him now
[36:42] here's here's uh what I realized and he
[36:46] said well brother Ron I was raised up in
[36:48] your church I the little boy and I was I
[36:51] was the star of your uh play Joseph and
[36:56] I played Joseph
[36:58] and everything and I was there and I
[37:00] says but all these years if you're going
[37:02] because I asked when did you quit going
[37:04] to church he said well about 13 14 I
[37:07] just quit it's you know he said I'd
[37:09] rather stay home and play and I I you
[37:13] know and so I said we've been raised
[37:16] around the message now here's what I'm
[37:18] going to say to you young men you've
[37:20] been raised around the message but I
[37:21] want you to get into
[37:24] it okay cuz you can be raised around it
[37:28] and it's just religion that's
[37:30] right I don't want you to just have a
[37:34] religion I want you to know from the
[37:37] Bible and I had told uh I told David I
[37:40] said David here's an app where you can
[37:42] go if you want to see I says go you know
[37:45] cuz he's a tech guy and I said go here
[37:49] and download the table and I said then

[37:54] think that's good and I want all and I'm
[37:56] just going to put it out here to our
[37:58] young people I want you to have just
[38:00] like you should have your own
[38:02] Bible I want you to get your own message
[38:06] books your own Seven Seals your own
[38:08] church age book and you start reading

[38:17] Dad and you know I went there because
[38:19] they made me and you know uh but I thank
[38:23] God if I told David I said if you if
[38:26] you're sincere and you really want to
[38:28] know ask God and I says and then you've
[38:32] got Bible questions you just write them
[38:34] down we'll get together so I'm excited
[38:36] about that I told him and and we had a
[38:38] big time he's a big smile and he said

[39:02] 24: um
[39:04] 1-15 and Abraham was old and well
[39:07] stricken in age and the Lord had blessed
[39:10] Abraham in all things and Abraham said
[39:14] unto his eldest servant of his house
[39:16] that rule over all that he had put I
[39:19] pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I
[39:23] will make thee swear by the Lord the god
[39:25] of Heaven and the god of the Earth Earth
[39:28] that thou shalt take a w Thou shalt not
[39:31] take a wife unto my son of the daughters
[39:34] of Canaanites among whom I dwell but
[39:38] Thou shalt go unto my country and to my
[39:41] Kindred and take a wife unto my son
[39:45] Isaac and the servant said unto him per
[39:47] Adventure the woman will not be willing
[39:49] to follow me into this land must I needs
[39:53] bring thy son again into the land from
[39:56] whence thou camest
[39:58] and Abraham said unto him beware thou
[40:01] that thou bring not my son thither again
[40:04] and the Lord God Of Heaven which took me
[40:06] from my father's house and from the land
[40:09] of my Kindred and which spake unto me
[40:12] and that swear unto me saying unto thy
[40:15] seed will I give this land he shall send
[40:18] his Angel before thee and thou shalt
[40:21] take a wife unto my son from then and if
[40:24] the woman will not be willing to follow
[40:26] thee then and thou shalt be clear from
[40:29] this my oath only bring not my son
[40:32] thither again and the servant put his
[40:35] hand under the thigh of Abraham his
[40:37] master and swear to him concerning that
[40:41] matter and the servant took 10 camels of
[40:45] the camels of his master and departed
[40:47] for all the goods of his master were in
[40:50] his hand and he arose and went to
[40:54] Mesopotamia under the city of nahor
[40:57] and he made his camels to kneel down
[40:59] without the City by a well of water at
[41:02] the time of the
[41:04] evening my
[41:10] goodness even the time that women go out
[41:13] to draw water and he said oh Lord God of
[41:18] my master
[41:19] Abraham I pray thee send me good speed
[41:23] this day and show kindness unto my
[41:26] master Master
[41:28] Abraham behold I stand Here by a well of
[41:32] water and the daughters of men of the
[41:35] City come out to draw water and let it
[41:38] come to pass that the damsel to whom I
[41:41] shall say let down thy picture I pray
[41:44] thee that I may
[41:46] drink and she shall
[41:49] say drink and I will give thy camels
[41:52] drink also do you know how much 10
[41:56] camels will will drink amen we're not
[41:59] talking 10 horses and
[42:01] horses would drink a lot but 10
[42:05] camels
[42:07] okay and let her say I will give thy
[42:10] camels drink also let the same be she
[42:14] that thou Hast appointed for thy servant
[42:17] Isaac and thereby I shall know that th
[42:21] showed kindness unto my master and it
[42:24] came to pass before he had done speak
[42:27] speaking then behold
[42:29] Rebecca came out and was born to Bethel
[42:35] the son of milka the wife of neor
[42:37] Abraham's brother and her
[42:40] picture upon her
[42:42] shoulder he spoke the vision amen he
[42:47] prayed yes he asked God for kindness and
[42:50] good
[42:51] speed and Rebecca stepped into the
[42:54] vision amen father God I thank you for
[42:57] Thy word oh God I'm excited to look and
[43:00] see father that while a servant is yet
[43:03] praying steps in a woman unaware of what
[43:07] she's doing but she's answering the
[43:10] prayer of God's messenger I pray
[43:14] heavenly father that thou will bless Thy
[43:16] word to our heart tonight each and
[43:17] everyone open unto us the scriptures
[43:20] that we might see you more clearly we
[43:23] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God
[43:26] bless you you can be seated this evening
[43:28] in the presence of God
[43:31] Amen I titled this uh sermon when the
[43:35] bride steps into the spoken word
[43:39] Vision when the bride steps into the
[43:41] spoken word Vision because here's the
[43:43] messenger want you to understand a
[43:45] message from God is actually God's
[43:48] Vision a prophet like an un a SE or Seas
[43:51] things and what he does he's he's like
[43:53] the Watchman in the tower or on the wall
[43:56] watch and what of the night he sees
[43:59] things in their embryonic form he sees
[44:01] them a far off and and so when prophets
[44:05] speak they're speaking what they're
[44:06] seeing amen it's why God speaks to them
[44:09] if they are spiritual or they're a
[44:12] prophet I will speak unto them in
[44:15] visions and in dreams and so we see that
[44:18] a Prophet this ministry of brother
[44:21] brandham is not just Creeds and dogmas
[44:24] and rules and regulations it's actually
[44:26] a v ision so you're understanding all of
[44:30] you this connection that you have with
[44:33] this
[44:34] message and the uh this pulling that you
[44:40] have towards it this Destiny if you
[44:45] please that's pulling you towards it is
[44:49] actually showing you that you're part of
[44:52] the
[44:52] vision the Lord understand that okay uh
[44:57] God is not known by science he's not
[45:00] known by education he's known by
[45:04] Revelation and Revelation is given
[45:06] sovereignly he doesn't give it to
[45:09] everyone okay you can study the word and
[45:12] still not know God you can know Creeds
[45:14] and dogmas and and the precepts from
[45:17] God's word you can be a Pharisee and
[45:20] concerning the law blameless you can be
[45:23] a moral
[45:24] person but it that doesn't give you
[45:28] eternal life eternal life is when God
[45:30] shares with you his logos thought and
[45:33] that logos thought is God showing you
[45:36] where you were in the beginning and I
[45:39] want to take uh the subject the bride uh
[45:43] has made herself ready but I want to
[45:45] reword this a little bit and I want to
[45:47] say the bride has closed herself in the
[45:51] messengers
[45:53] garments because you will see that is
[45:57] when he sees her coming he knows that
[45:59] must be his bride
[46:01] why she's dressed in the garments that
[46:04] he gave
[46:06] eler amen all right so I just want to
[46:09] share with you because these types and
[46:11] shadows are quite exciting when you look
[46:13] through the word of God and then you see
[46:16] even as uh Andy revas was singing that
[46:19] song God can do it again we understand
[46:21] brother Brenham said that God is Hebrews
[46:24] 13 and8 he's the same yesterday today
[46:27] and forever so he says I the Lord God
[46:30] Chang not so what he's done in the past
[46:32] he'll do again and if you understand uh
[46:36] uh that when God begins to give a vision
[46:39] by the way of a prophet and you begin to
[46:42] uh have an affinity uh a pulling towards
[46:46] this actually what it is is you are
[46:48] becoming a part of the vision you're
[46:51] entering into it you're stepping into it
[46:54] when you agree with it and say I believe
[46:57] it what you're doing you're actually
[46:58] entering into the vision no different
[47:01] than Rebecca when uh when she
[47:05] came listen
[47:08] eler has just prayed and while he was
[47:12] just finishing his prayer amen we see
[47:16] Rebecca comes into the scene she is a
[47:20] spoken word bride Hallelujah she is
[47:23] there because she is actually prophecy
[47:26] being fulfilled she's the words of eler
[47:31] in
[47:32] manifestation do you understand she
[47:34] doesn't know it little did you know it
[47:37] when this message came across you you
[47:40] didn't know it you didn't know you were
[47:42] predestinated you didn't know you were
[47:44] ordained but there was something
[47:46] attracting you and when you heard this
[47:48] there was something that said no man
[47:50] spake like this man amen amen so you see
[47:56] uh um when you have a prophet and he
[48:00] speaks in the name of the Lord things
[48:02] don't automatically let go and become
[48:05] better right you remember when uh in the
[48:08] first Exodus and every time that Moses
[48:12] would say thus sayith the Lord let my
[48:14] people go what happened it got
[48:16] worse until finally Moses comes before
[48:20] God and he says wherefore hast thou sent
[48:23] me seeing thou Hast not delivered your
[48:26] people all you send me I spoke it and
[48:30] it's
[48:33] worse so understand things sometimes get
[48:36] worse before they get better I was in
[48:39] the back room telling the brothers my
[48:41] computer today went crazy I couldn't get
[48:44] it to work couldn't this and that and I
[48:46] and and you know where is Matthew yeski
[48:49] when I need him he you know and I can't
[48:51] even get it I I can't even get on in
[48:55] anyway I just you know know and then
[48:57] Zachary comes in I said man I had a
[49:00] rough day you know my computer he said
[49:02] well my car got
[49:04] stolen oh your car get St yeah uh yeah
[49:07] not only that my AC quit in my house oh
[49:11] wow uh and not only that my two and 3
[49:15] and 1/2 ton dump trailer the axle got uh
[49:19] bent and uh he just keeps going on he's
[49:22] on a roll he you know and I said my
[49:26] computer's not so
[49:28] bad I don't have no problems compared to
[49:30] Zach you know and so anyway sometimes
[49:33] you need somebody put you in a little
[49:35] perspective and so he put me in
[49:39] perspective now listen God does not come
[49:42] according to your understanding he comes
[49:45] according to his word and after the word
[49:48] is revealed and he makes you understand
[49:51] this is the word coming to pass then
[49:55] your eyes become open and you recognize
[49:58] that it's God doing the work okay now uh
[50:01] even after all of God's Vindicated signs
[50:04] and after all the Wonders and after
[50:07] destroying Pharaoh's Army and the
[50:10] plagues and on and on we could rehearse
[50:13] all of that understand and they did the
[50:15] brass Serpent and everything and and
[50:17] opening the Red Sea you would have
[50:19] thought that everybody was convinced and
[50:22] nobody would come against Moses man
[50:28] if if I saw stand and see the glory of
[50:36] God
[50:37] man I'm never going to make that guy mad
[50:40] at
[50:42] me that's God's man anyway the Bible
[50:46] says in Hebrews 4 1 and 2 let us
[50:49] therefore
[50:50] fear lest a promise being left us of
[50:54] entering into his
[50:57] rest and any of you should ever come
[51:00] short of
[51:02] it for unto us was the Gospel preached
[51:05] somebody say amen amen we've heard the
[51:07] gospel you've been in church how long
[51:10] does God how many sermons do you have to
[51:13] hear you see it's just line upon line
[51:16] precept upon precept show us the father
[51:19] how long have you been with me Jesus
[51:22] said that if you've seen the father
[51:25] you've sent me because I and my father
[51:27] are one so I want you to understand For
[51:30] unto us was the Gospel preached as well
[51:33] as unto them but the word preached did
[51:36] not profit
[51:38] them not being mixed with
[51:41] faith in them that heard it so it's not
[51:44] well I went to
[51:46] church I was there as a young boy I
[51:48] raised up and there yeah but what did
[51:50] you
[51:52] hear you didn't hardly hear
[51:55] anything you it was just a social
[51:57] Gathering God help us and with our
[52:01] children this is not a little social
[52:03] Gathering we're to get into something
[52:05] and understand this is a this is you
[52:08] know even as I told David I said David
[52:11] per Adventure just listen to this if God
[52:15] sent a prophet in this end time if God
[52:20] sends a messenger he's doing it because
[52:23] he said well who's right who has truth
[52:27] you know and I began to quote the
[52:29] scriptures I am the way the truth and
[52:31] the life and even Pontius Pilate said
[52:33] what is truth I said we didn't know and
[52:37] you and I inclusive did not know real
[52:39] truth until a prophet came and returned
[52:42] our faith
[52:44] back to the Faith of Our
[52:47] Fathers so that we could understand now
[52:51] what good is it to hear all these
[52:52] sermons and not have every sermon mixed
[52:56] with faith and Faith being a
[52:59] revelation so we don't want to we don't
[53:03] want to be those that have just heard
[53:05] and then be a forgetful hearer we want
[53:09] to get into this message brother Braham
[53:11] said don't talk about it let's get into
[53:13] it and so a lot of times you see that
[53:18] what happens is there might be somebody
[53:21] within the message perhaps a person of
[53:23] influence a minister a prominent man or
[53:26] somebody and the next thing you know
[53:28] even and I just give you an example even
[53:30] those who
[53:32] um started this believe the sign I was
[53:36] there before they launched it I was in
[53:39] the office of brother bisc he said a
[53:42] brother in my church has worked for a
[53:43] couple years now a year and a half I
[53:45] believe he and his son and we want to
[53:48] show you CU we're going to launch this
[53:51] and I I yeah okay sat there and so they
[53:53] got it computerized put it on the
[53:55] Monitor and
[53:57] believe the sign and this and that this
[53:59] sign in the Supernatural and over here
[54:02] when they got done uh uh brother bcll
[54:05] said and you know he's such a
[54:07] gentleman uh and he says so brother Ron
[54:11] what do you think and I said well I I
[54:15] says excuse me and I'm not you know and
[54:18] and really I don't know why you ask me I
[54:21] said because it really doesn't matter
[54:23] but I said I want to ask you all of
[54:26] these signs which one of them made you a
[54:30] Believer which was it the pillar of
[54:34] fire was it the
[54:36] cloud which sign was it the Miracles and
[54:41] you said oh now now I saw the cloud and
[54:46] God revealed to me and now I'm a
[54:48] Believer which sign made you a Believer
[54:52] I said listen we're not following signs
[54:55] we follow the
[54:56] word and I said signs follow us you
[55:02] understand and I said look even though
[55:04] God even as I shared with David Weeden I
[55:07] said God can do Supernatural things in
[55:10] front of people where they know they can
[55:12] say oh man thou uh this man is a man
[55:14] sent from God cuz no man could do these
[55:17] things except that God be with him and I
[55:19] said no matter how much it was proven
[55:22] before the people there are still
[55:24] doubters and unbelievers that's right
[55:28] okay so not everyone's going to believe
[55:30] but you will believe why because it's
[55:32] revealed to you that's why you follow it
[55:35] because you got Revelation because if
[55:38] you just have religion then somebody
[55:41] comes along with maybe a a better um
[55:45] let's say a way to explain religion you
[55:49] know like that well how do you know
[55:50] there is a God I think man invented a
[55:53] God and he said wow what a what a a nice
[55:56] programmed to just invent a God and tell
[55:59] the people and then they all conform to
[56:01] it you know that's that's theology well
[56:05] listen uh God was not
[56:09] invented he
[56:10] was and I said isn't it amazing that
[56:14] through science and wisdom man doesn't
[56:16] know
[56:17] God and I said they broke into brother
[56:20] BR said they broke into God's Great
[56:21] laboratory and they're discovering
[56:23] things DNA and all this kind of stuff
[56:26] but that'll never prove God I said it
[56:29] for without faith it's impossible right
[56:32] to believe and to love God or to have
[56:35] faith in you so God has to give you a
[56:39] Measure of Faith which that's a gift to
[56:42] God for you to
[56:45] believe amen amen
[56:48] so there are different ones that rise up
[56:52] and maybe they pull off a group of
[56:54] people and they they go off and the next
[56:58] thing you know there's a tangent a
[57:00] breakaway group and what happens to them
[57:04] eventually what they're doing is taking
[57:06] away from from the message and then they
[57:10] take away from the Bible because really
[57:13] the intent is to take you away from the
[57:16] revealed word of the hour you understand
[57:19] that they're actually not getting at
[57:21] brother Brenham they're getting at the
[57:22] god of brother Brenham they're getting
[57:24] at the Christ of God you understand that
[57:28] okay so even among all of the things let
[57:31] me give you an example of that found in
[57:33] Numbers chapter
[57:35] 16 now Kora and the son of ishar and the
[57:39] son of Kath and the son of Levi and
[57:41] Dayan and Abram and the sons of eliab
[57:45] and on and the son of palath and the
[57:48] sons of Reuben took men watch this and
[57:51] they rose up therefore before Moses and
[57:54] certain of the children of Israel 200
[57:56] 150
[57:58] princes of the
[58:01] assembly the Bible says
[58:03] famous in the congregation
[58:08] men of
[58:10] renown so somehow these guys got men who
[58:16] had influence and were looked up in the
[58:19] congregation is that right that's what
[58:21] your Bible says and they gathered
[58:23] themselves together against Moses and
[58:26] against Aaron and said unto them you
[58:29] take too much unto
[58:31] you seeing all the congregation Are
[58:34] Holy every one of them and the Lord is
[58:37] among them therefore then lift ye up
[58:40] yourselves above the congregation of the
[58:43] Lord you see what I'm saying God rose up
[58:46] Moses it wasn't Moses he was the meest
[58:48] of of all men that's what the Bible says
[58:51] but anyway I want you to understand no
[58:54] matter how Vindicated of God you're
[58:56] always going to have somebody here's
[58:58] daythan and Kora that rise up now this
[59:01] is not Janice and jambur back in
[59:05] denomination this is Dayan and Kora Who
[59:07] come out under the signs Who come out
[59:10] who seen all the Supernatural and now
[59:13] they rise up against Moses right and
[59:16] it's not really Moses it's like the
[59:18] people when they rejected Samuel Samuel
[59:20] got despondent and said they've rejected
[59:22] me and God told him it's not you Samuel
[59:25] they rejecting that's right they're
[59:27] rejecting
[59:28] me and and and look even Moses goes away
[59:32] for a few days on the mount and Aaron
[59:34] the high priest what does he do the
[59:37] people put pressure on him so he builds
[59:38] a golden cat oh my next thing you know
[59:41] there's dancing and ring and we got this
[59:44] Revelation Hallelujah and got all the
[59:46] people all excited and there was all
[59:48] kinds of anointing and when Moses came
[59:50] down Joshua was waiting there right and
[59:54] he says oh my I hear the sound of war in
[59:57] the camp what did Moses say it's not war
[1:00:00] it's
[1:00:01] frolly it's reving you see a wrong
[1:00:04] Revelation can cause you to get so
[1:00:06] stimulated you'll think Hey listen false
[1:00:09] Revelation false wine is as toxic as
[1:00:13] real
[1:00:17] wine okay
[1:00:20] so we never judge something by its
[1:00:23] anointing right okay but we judge it by
[1:00:27] the word because brother Bram said look
[1:00:29] one of the closest lies is 99% the
[1:00:33] truth it's just the changing of one word
[1:00:37] that can that can bring an outcome and
[1:00:39] bring bring forth death now so
[1:00:43] understand if you guys remember the time
[1:00:45] that David was wanting to bring the ark
[1:00:48] back into um Israel right and he got so
[1:00:52] excited Here Comes The Ark and he's
[1:00:54] dancing until his Ro falls off and he's
[1:00:57] all excited they've got trumpets they've
[1:00:59] got all of the everybody and they're out
[1:01:01] there and it's a big procession and here
[1:01:03] comes the an ox cart with the Ark on an
[1:01:07] ox cart now remember it was never to be
[1:01:10] placed on an ox cart okay what was wrong
[1:01:14] it was always to be carried over the
[1:01:16] shoulders of the Levites but what
[1:01:19] happened The Oxen stumbled there was a a
[1:01:23] dip in the road The Oxen stumbled and
[1:01:25] the arc w faed and it says and usua put
[1:01:28] his hand to the ark that it might not
[1:01:32] fall well that that's good thank you USA
[1:01:36] but he touched the ark and what happened
[1:01:39] the anger of God slew
[1:01:41] him now if Jesus Christ is the same
[1:01:44] yesterday today and forever and God
[1:01:46] changes not brother Brenham said to put
[1:01:49] your hand to the ark or the word of God
[1:01:51] today without a calling in your life
[1:01:54] brings forth death spiritual death death
[1:01:56] to the people okay so let let's go back
[1:01:59] to the scripture here or look let let me
[1:02:02] show you
[1:02:06] um okay I I I'm not going to read the
[1:02:09] part from the India report we're going
[1:02:11] to go down um remember now I read to you
[1:02:14] Genesis 24: 11-13 I'm going to go over
[1:02:18] that again with you and he made his
[1:02:20] camels to kneel down without the City by
[1:02:22] a well of water at the time of the
[1:02:25] evenings so now we we understand it's
[1:02:27] evening time he sent with a message and
[1:02:30] his message is to go get a bride for
[1:02:34] Isaac is that right okay so let's be
[1:02:37] spiritual about this he's there as a
[1:02:41] messenger and he says I'm looking for
[1:02:43] character and he said I'm at a well and
[1:02:47] you know what God does many things in
[1:02:50] scriptures at
[1:02:52] Wells there was a woman at the well all
[1:02:55] kinds of things so I'm not going to go
[1:02:56] into that and if you're going to catch
[1:02:58] fish you go where fish are caught amen
[1:03:01] and so here is a woman okay and he is
[1:03:05] saying hey Lord I don't want to be here
[1:03:08] for too long I don't want to waste my
[1:03:11] time and waste my Master's money because
[1:03:15] he gave me
[1:03:16] goods and go there and find my son a
[1:03:20] bride and so he says all right Lord
[1:03:23] let's cut to the chase I'm here there's
[1:03:26] a well and all these women are coming
[1:03:29] but I want you father to have the one I
[1:03:33] will say unto her give me to drink and
[1:03:37] she will say to me so now he's
[1:03:40] rehearsing a vision he's speaking it are
[1:03:43] you understanding this he's speaking
[1:03:47] this of what this bride is going to be
[1:03:49] like her character what she will say at
[1:03:54] his messy amen so they he says now she
[1:03:58] will say I will not only give you a
[1:04:00] drink but I will now water your camels
[1:04:04] and he says and then I will
[1:04:08] know because what he's doing here's
[1:04:11] there's all kinds of women but this
[1:04:13] woman steps into the vision she's a
[1:04:17] spoken word bride she's there because he
[1:04:21] spoke
[1:04:23] it do you realize her whole life she was
[1:04:26] birthed her father her mother this and
[1:04:29] that I don't know how old she was but
[1:04:32] here she is and she's coming with a
[1:04:35] picture and you understand she's she's
[1:04:38] there just like any other day to get
[1:04:41] water amen but she meets a
[1:04:44] messenger and he speaks something she
[1:04:47] speaks back and her very
[1:04:50] words are causing her to step into the
[1:04:53] vision amen prise the Lorden
[1:04:59] so God does things that Wells I love to
[1:05:03] look at that um eler here now we all
[1:05:08] understand he's on a Divine
[1:05:10] Mission I want you to put your hand on
[1:05:12] your your my thigh and swear by the god
[1:05:14] of Heaven and the god of Earth take not
[1:05:17] a woman of Canaan I want you to go to my
[1:05:20] message people and message Believers
[1:05:22] because under no circumstance
[1:05:25] do I want my son to marry an unbeliever
[1:05:29] somebody say
[1:05:30] Amen I'm paraphrasing that but that's
[1:05:34] basically what he said I don't want a
[1:05:36] woman of Canaan I don't want the some
[1:05:39] Jezebel from the land of which we live
[1:05:41] in I want you to go to message
[1:05:43] Believers and it isn't it amazing that
[1:05:47] he's going to even Abraham's
[1:05:50] brother and he finds a woman here she is
[1:05:53] she's answering the very very prayer
[1:05:56] that he's been praying
[1:05:58] now he's there to find a bride for
[1:06:01] Rising chapter 24 verse1 14 and let it
[1:06:04] come to pass that the damsel to whom I
[1:06:07] shall say let down thy picture I pray
[1:06:10] thee that I may drink she will say drink
[1:06:13] and I will give thy camels drink
[1:06:16] also let the same be she that thou Hast
[1:06:21] appointed understand she's appointed to
[1:06:23] this that's right do you realize she is
[1:06:27] appointed to receive this messenger so
[1:06:31] may I put it on you for a moment you
[1:06:34] were
[1:06:35] appointed you were
[1:06:37] actually
[1:06:39] predestinated this was for you you were
[1:06:42] appointed because God keeps all of his
[1:06:46] appointments and just like
[1:06:49] zakus up in the tree or blind Bemus any
[1:06:53] one of them hey this day
[1:06:56] I've got an appointment when you came
[1:06:58] across this message you know what it was
[1:07:00] you were appointed to
[1:07:03] it praise the Lord you didn't know it
[1:07:06] but you were appointed to
[1:07:08] it you were elected by God eler is
[1:07:12] asking God to give him favor and so her
[1:07:16] response to his request is assigned to
[1:07:20] elaser that's right when brother Bren
[1:07:23] preaches sermons like choosing a bride
[1:07:24] and he talks about
[1:07:26] character he says when the woman
[1:07:28] responds to what I'm
[1:07:32] saying he says I'll know that's the
[1:07:35] one now I believe sister Barker was
[1:07:40] telling us she was there and sister
[1:07:43] Nancy Patterson and sister Barker they
[1:07:46] were both there in Los Angeles when
[1:07:48] brother brandham spoke choosing a
[1:07:51] bride if I remember correctly and I like
[1:07:54] to have her tell the test morning
[1:07:56] sometime there was people there that
[1:07:59] during the service of brother Brenan
[1:08:01] preaching choosing a bride were so
[1:08:03] offended they said this sermon is
[1:08:07] vulgar and they walked
[1:08:09] out and they said it's horrible could
[1:08:13] you imagine a man preaching like that
[1:08:15] look this cow in the eye and he makes
[1:08:19] comparisons and and said oh I've never
[1:08:23] oh it was offensive it was vulgar and I
[1:08:27] believe uh that they took this tape and
[1:08:30] gave it to someone else and the Very on
[1:08:32] that said it was vulgar and had walked
[1:08:35] out the other said I found nothing
[1:08:38] offensive in fact I was responding
[1:08:42] amen do you understand when eler is
[1:08:46] coming and he's preaching his message
[1:08:49] and he's speaking these words your
[1:08:52] response to it is what he says that's
[1:08:55] the one
[1:08:56] appointed Hallelujah that's why you can
[1:08:59] say or he can say as I preach the
[1:09:03] message I'm actually he says I don't
[1:09:06] tell them everything I say just enough
[1:09:08] of the word and during that third pole
[1:09:12] if they catch
[1:09:17] it see what is it it's the word that
[1:09:19] caught
[1:09:21] you wasn't the
[1:09:24] message the the message is
[1:09:27] Christ that's what caught
[1:09:30] you and he says all that the father hath
[1:09:33] given me what will come to me and I
[1:09:36] haven't lost one of them that's right so
[1:09:39] once you're caught you're caught and
[1:09:42] I've often told you and listen God is
[1:09:44] the greatest fisherman once you're
[1:09:46] hooked you're hooked you can fight all
[1:09:48] you want in fact a fisherman loves a

[1:10:44] Hallelujah and when I'm hooked oh yeah

[1:10:49] message who
[1:10:51] hasn't right listen if you ain't been
[1:10:54] around long enough there'll be somebody
[1:10:57] that's going to lock horns with you and

[1:15:00] response of
[1:15:02] Rebecca he knows that's
[1:15:05] her now I want you to see why we are not
[1:15:08] a denomination brother Ram says this did
[1:15:11] you notice Rebecca when Ellie eer found
[1:15:14] her it was in the evening time and she
[1:15:17] watered the camel because El eer he then
[1:15:22] quotes what he
[1:15:23] said and while he was yet in prayer
[1:15:27] Rebecca come and draw water and give him
[1:15:29] a drink and watered the camel notice the
[1:15:32] camel was a
[1:15:33] beast and that same Beast that she was
[1:15:36] watering was the one who packed her to
[1:15:39] the bride Isaac I want you to understand
[1:15:42] that this
[1:15:44] message as you water it it's packing you
[1:15:48] it's taking you to Isaac Hallelujah I
[1:15:52] just love that amen
[1:15:56] see brother Brown said there's a deep
[1:15:58] calling to the Deep therefore there's a
[1:16:00] deep inside of you to respond now we
[1:16:03] don't talk you into this right you know
[1:16:06] I visited with a young brother here not
[1:16:08] long ago and he was giv me every excuse

[1:16:13] this and I've prayed and it's never
[1:16:14] worked for
[1:16:15] me and I just don't know I said I
[1:16:19] believe that you are a son of God
[1:16:21] predestinated
[1:16:23] well it's not revealed to

[1:18:17] Jacob and when Jacob is left alone
[1:18:19] that's when God spoke to him sometimes
[1:18:22] God has got to get you a
[1:18:25] alone so he can shake your
[1:18:28] tree and get you to the place see uh
[1:18:33] bethl experiences he saw angels

[1:18:38] House of God that's bethl he saw it he
[1:18:41] was excited didn't change his life what
[1:18:44] changed the life of of Jacob is he comes
[1:18:47] to a place called
[1:18:48] pineal where I meet
[1:18:51] God face to face and you wrestle with
[1:18:54] him and I'm telling you that's what
[1:18:56] every one of you and you young people
[1:18:59] understand this there'll come a time in
[1:19:01] your life when you're going to say you
[1:19:03] know I like Jacob did I know my
[1:19:07] grandfather told me my grandfather
[1:19:10] Abraham and my father Isaac and they
[1:19:12] told me all these things and
[1:19:13] Supernatural and mezic and all the
[1:19:16] stories and they're wonderful but but
[1:19:19] Jacob when he prays I pray to the god of
[1:19:21] Abraham and to the god of Jacob but it
[1:19:24] was wasn't his
[1:19:26] God it wasn't revealed to him yet but
[1:19:30] when he got to a place and here's where
[1:19:32] each one of us have got to have your
[1:19:35] penal exerience with God and that is you
[1:19:39] wrestle with
[1:19:41] this you do you wrestle how how badly do
[1:19:44] you want a blessing from God right well
[1:19:49] I'm going through a few trials and you
[1:19:52] know well if God's going to if I'm
[1:19:54] predestin n you ain't even wanting to
[1:19:56] fight for it cuz anything in
[1:20:00] life if it's worth anything you're going
[1:20:03] to have to work for
[1:20:05] it or you're going to have to fight for
[1:20:07] it come on now somebody say
[1:20:09] Amen if you're happy to just dig ditches
[1:20:12] for 10 bucks an hour go for it see what
[1:20:15] I'm
[1:20:16] saying don't lower your
[1:20:20] standard raise the standard and bring
[1:20:23] the child to the standard
[1:20:27] amen so brother Bram says in a time of
[1:20:33] decision he says and notice the sermon
[1:20:37] time at a time of decision she thought
[1:20:40] she was okay I'll give you water and
[1:20:43] I'll Water your camels so it's a
[1:20:45] decision time so as elar believed and
[1:20:49] committed himself to God then they could
[1:20:51] have searched the world over they could
[1:20:53] have combed through every city went to
[1:20:55] every house and could have never found a
[1:20:57] better mate for Isaac than Rebecca was
[1:20:59] see it's the old Wesley and Methodist
[1:21:02] ritual as Isaac and Rebecca lived
[1:21:05] happily uh together uh may this couple
[1:21:08] they were sweethearts it was a type of
[1:21:10] Christ and the church you see it was the
[1:21:13] spirit of God leading
[1:21:16] elaser to pray that
[1:21:18] prayer and it was the spirit leading she
[1:21:22] didn't know it wasn't revealed to her
[1:21:24] right then but she was going to get
[1:21:26] water she's going into a
[1:21:29] vision and when she drops into his
[1:21:33] vision the messenger and she speaks
[1:21:38] she's stepping into the vision now it's
[1:21:41] a sign to elaser that's the one God has
[1:21:45] given me favor and he knew right away so
[1:21:48] again let's go to this uh same sermon
[1:21:52] spoke in Los Angeles Isaac was a type of
[1:21:55] Christ through Isaac come Christ and
[1:21:58] then Rebecca was a type of the church
[1:22:00] did you notice the bride elazer found
[1:22:02] Rebecca in the evening time the sign was
[1:22:05] performed in the evening time that's the
[1:22:07] time we're living in I trust you get
[1:22:10] this amen it was in the evening time
[1:22:13] that Rebecca came out led by the spirit
[1:22:16] do you believe that amen he say she was
[1:22:18] led by the spirit in the evening time
[1:22:21] and elaser the messenger the minister
[1:22:24] the true servant to his master was led
[1:22:26] in the evening time and the true servant
[1:22:29] had left his Creeds and things behind
[1:22:31] him and made up his Min he was going to
[1:22:34] trust God in the evening time amen oh my
[1:22:39] Hallelujah now here's another thing that
[1:22:42] I found in the scriptures there in
[1:22:44] Genesis
[1:22:47] 24 and verses 26 through3 but I'm just
[1:22:51] going to read verses
[1:22:52] 29 onward and Rebecca had a brother and
[1:22:56] his name was laan and laan ran out unto
[1:23:00] the man unto the well and it came to
[1:23:03] pass when he saw the earrings and
[1:23:05] bracelets upon his sister's hands when
[1:23:09] he heard the words of Rebecca her sister
[1:23:12] saying thus spake the man unto me that
[1:23:16] he came unto the man and behold he stood
[1:23:19] by the camels at the well I want you to
[1:23:21] understand he's looking she's already
[1:23:23] got gifts
[1:23:27] she's so excited about this man that
[1:23:29] she's met how many of you have said hey
[1:23:32] come see a man I'm telling nobody like
[1:23:35] the woman at the well who said come see
[1:23:37] a man who's told me all these
[1:23:39] things and the Holy Spirit is looking
[1:23:42] for a
[1:23:43] response from her but when she spoke it
[1:23:47] do you realize she's activating a faith
[1:23:50] inside of her and now she's being
[1:23:53] quickened she's going right into the uh
[1:23:56] uh she's going into the vision she's
[1:23:58] stepping into
[1:24:00] it so I'm just going to skip some of
