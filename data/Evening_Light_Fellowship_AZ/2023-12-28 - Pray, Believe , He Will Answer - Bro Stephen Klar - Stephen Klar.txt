when you got somebody that's been on the team for a while and he seeson veteran he gets hurt what he does is he goes to the sideline he has to rehab for a while yeah he's he's got a rehab then as he

season a time of worship Lord unto you yes Father we didn't pay attention to all the Christmas tinsel and all the worldly things but Lord our eyes were set upon the cross we knew that you came Lord and you were born but you were born to die and our eyes have been set father upon that cross yes and Lord we're in in between now when we're going to enter into a new year 2024 is before us and father we pray that you would Quicken our hearts today Lord to receive that Lord we'll step into the new year a little bit more fervent a little more desirous Lord to serve you yes Lord Lord we're not making New Year's plans but Lord as Believers we have desire to serve you better father I pray that you would anoint the word as it would be spoken today Lord I believe oh God that you have desired to speak to somebody here today Lord you knew my heart and how many weeks ago brother Ron had texted and Lord I I was I was desirous and I I I I had a plan in mind of what I thought would be good to speak to the people Lord I was excited and but Lord Jesus you came so sweetly in the room last Thursday and Lord I believe it was somebody that was going to be here today begin to pray and they had a need Lord and you changed the program amen Lord I pray oh God that we would reach out and touch you today may we forget about the things that we've done Lord during the day or the week before or what's going to happen Lord tomorrow or even this wedding time my family is so excited to fellowship and partake on but Lord may we focus now upon the most important thing and that's you Jesus yes so come by our way Lord yes we give our hearts to you and I pray that the enemy would be bound Lord yes I pray Lord that your sweet Spirit would do the ministering to your people today Lord you spoke to brother James in scripture and said if you draw nigh unto me I'll draw nigh unto you so we pause for just a moment we say Lord yes draw onto US yes we think of you what you've done in scripture Lord and it excites us Lord father we think about what you've done in this generation through brother Brandon our prophet of this age and it excites us Lord but Lord we want to look now what you're doing here in this moment and you're changing hearts Lord we've heard of someone who's desired already to give their heart back to you there are many more Lord that have fallen away maybe and they desire to give their heart back to you so father may we draw nigh unto you that we might receive Lord the promise given to us and to our children and our children's children as many as the Lord God the scripture says has called we claim every promise in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen amen praise the Lord amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen let's turn in our Bibles to Jeremiah chap 33 God bless you all amen you did such a wonderful job today in in song Jeremiah 33:3 I'm so happy today that we can be joined today with my father who's in the building today and he's been a inspiration to me amen he's been a a mighty soldier of the gospel for many many years and amen he's come this way and the Lord has helped him in a situation he had a medical situation and I believe he was a church that prayed at that time when he had that medical situation and the Lord undertook for him amen and so we're so grateful for that and we're grateful to have brother John Andy's my pastor here with us today amen praise the Lord amen Jeremiah chapter 33 reading verse three call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not yes what a command what a call what a cry what our God speaking to us through inspiration through Jeremiah call unto me yes if you call unto me I will answer thee if we could move our scripture to uh to Micah chapter 7 and reading verse 7 if you will say Amen once you have the scripture Micah 7:7 the prophet there says therefore I will look unto the Lord and I will wait for the god of my salvation yes my God will hear me isn't that inspiration to you tonight if you call he will answer you amen if you look towards the Lord he is going to hear you blessed be the name of the Lord father we give you thanks for the scripture reading we give you thanks Lord for the opportunity to express ourselves brother on it's been so generous to us Lord to allow us to stand in this pulpit and now Lord we allow you to take control would you do the speaking to your people may your spirit Lord be anointing the ministry now Lord as we separate ourselves Lord from our own being and we ask you oh Lord to speak words of truth to the people in Jesus Christ's name amen amen why don't you have your seats this evening amen praise the Lord amen I I feel inspired today to speak to you last time I came and brother Ron allowed me to speak I I have to confess I was very nervous Amen to have a man of God is such of his caliber to sit behind me and but today I I thank the Lord because I I feel comfortable in the house of God with you today to speak words of life and I I pray that I could just be myself I feel my heart you know I I as I prayed I I I just moments ago I asked the Lord as brother Ron invited I asked him Lord what would you like to speak and my heart was exp excited to to speak a message that greater than all the prophets are here and I wanted to run down the line and tell you the Lord Jesus is I was excited but last Thursday little The Voice you know the Lord speaks to our heart and last Thursday the Lord spoke to me and said they know I'm here but they need to know that I need to be called upon we need to call upon Him many times we think about prayer and we understand that we ought to pray and I I like to start off with a quotation from the prophet and lifting him out of history in 1958 the prophet would say he's a historical God and a present day God am we're not looking in the rear re mirr now today and looking back at history no we're we're looking what God is doing present time present moments right here in the building tonight the prophet of God would say he's waiting to be called upon are you willing to call upon the Lord even in this service if you had a need in your heart if you had something that is burdening you today are you willing to pause for that moment in his presence and call the everpresent God on the scene and say Lord I have sickness in my body but you can be my healer Lord I I have an unconfessed sin today Lord but you can take what was just wrong you can take that was sinful that which is full of unbelief and you can turn it around tonight he's waiting to be called upon call upon the Lord he heal will hear you speak to him in Psalm pray to him believe him and he'll answer those words pray believe and he will answer has stuck into my heart how many tonight will agree with me how with me will agree with me tonight and know that prayer is a struggle that is it's really hard to pray you know many times I I I I I've gone on my knees and I'm a lot like maybe all of you and I've got down on my knees and I begin to pray and as I'm praying you know I you have the struggles that go on the Mind battles the the things that put Satan puts in your way and you're the heavens they feel like brass you know I I I've told my wife and my wife knows she she said I don't like cleaning the car how many how many likes to clean their car but you know something as I as I'm praying I'm even thinking about how wonderful it would be to clean my car oh my you know I I get thinking about all the burdens that we have at church and I and all the struggle all those things and because the there's a great battle that's going on there's a great struggle but regardless of the struggle there's an absolute necessity that the believer gets down into prayer right I want to ask you this if I if I had the ability and I and I don't if you see on my bank account you'd recognize that I don't have this ability but if I had the ability tonight to share with you how that you all could become millionaires in a short amount of time you would all sit together and you would all think you know I want to listen to Brother Steve I you know he's a he possibly is got that kind of Finance you kind of kind of money maybe I could learn something from him and you'd all have your your notepads in order to find out what is the key to success what is it that's going to make me as a millionaire well tonight brother I got something to tell you that's beyond the na the natural millions that you can make in this life I want to tell you through the voice of a prophet if it was just me tonight telling you this is the success this is how to become successful in your spiritual life you could take it or leave it but the prophet of God tells us today he says the fellowship the key to success the key today is something simple but it's prayer the very thing that we struggle over amen the very simplest thing now if I if I would tell you some great uh uh uh thing to do that was difficult I'm sure all of us today would have written it down and went outside the door and we would have pushed forward we want to do this Great Mighty thing but when it's a very simple remedy it's something very simple that all of us can do friends we let it slip our minds we take to other things we we let other things get in the way and brother Brandon would say in 1950 in the mess's expectation he would said that's the secret of all mysteries of God you can read it there for yourself that's the key that opens the door to everything of God is prayer beautiful beauti the key to your success as a spiritual believer to be able to to have this quality of fellowship with God is to get into that place with Jesus Christ where him and you are on that level of husband and wife that intimate relationship I'm not just speaking to you you need to be just a friend of God or a girlfriend of God I I'm talking to the Lamb's wife tonight amen that's who you are tonight and brother Brandon would say in the message the key to the door you know I key that Lo locks and unlocks true can you see that you know a key that locks unlocks too see you can uh uh loose or bind that's right the same key that locks unlocks we know that brother brand would say Prayer Changes Things Are prayer is the greatest you know Atomic weapon that there is but in this building tonight as Believers being the Lamb's wife do you believe that tonight right you have the authority under your adoption tonight to speak the word of God and what you speak is God speaking what you bind it's God's bind what un you unlock is God unlocking but we missed this whole principle that the prophet is giving to us and we let it slip by us so easily maybe let me run down a a moment of your day or I'm going to be just really open with you I I'm going to give you a heart to heart today amen sometimes the beginning of our mornings morning is good morning Jesus you know Lord I'm rushing just a little bit today this morning was a little busy you see I was tired from the night before come on how many's been there with me I'm a little bit tired from the night before I I had I haven't had my coffee yet some of us need our coffees by interus you know I haven't had my coffee yet but Lord I I trust that you'll just keep me safe today and I promise when I get home later tonight you and I will have some fellowship we we tend to have these mornings we tend to rush and and leave our lord Jesus so to speak speak in the dust and then you know by midday it we we find ourselves that we are a little bit uh hungry and we find ourselves at the cafeteria or find ourselves somewhere and you know man the place is packed out how many's ever been there the coffee room is packed out the place is packed out I'm just preaching ordinary to you I'm just an ordinary guy the the C everything's full I used to work in the operating room and we'd go and the and the and the lunchroom was full of doctors and nurses and people that thought a lot of themselves and and we would sit in there and sudden you look around and you think well Lord It's a I'm thankful for this lunch we do the little facial swipe as we pray God we're so thankful for we're just thankful for the food that was on our table and Lord I I don't want to to make my my colleagues feel awkward that's why I won't make a long drawn up prayer they they'll all feel awkward when really in our lives friends he's the first part he he's the the the reason that we we're alive he's the reason that we're here as we just heard we we did not choose him the message did we didn't choose the message but the message chose us then you get to a time I and yes I'm trying to be a little bit comical so that you stay with me for just a moment but but we're all the same you know many times uh we stand here in the pulpit and you would think nothing goes wrong in a Minister's life or everything is amazing but we go through the same burdens the same struggles the same mind battles that you would all go through so you come home from work and how many's with me tonight comes home and they're tired you you strived you've been around people and you know you you just struggle in the door the wife Pats you on the back just to little and welcomes you home and you just don't want to go you don't want to do anything else so now it's time for bed and you invite the Lord over to your bedside and you crawl under your covers and pull the little sheets up nice high and you say Lord we're going to have a conversation now well I'm relaxing you know what happens to me it's 30 seconds and I am s lber Lumber I am sleep you see this is how human life is you see the Christian Life prayer friends the fellowship with the Lord should just be like our natural breathing you don't have to think about breathing how many of you any any of you here this evening just now thought about breathing uh brother Ron man I I should never asked that question in in a room where the pastor is healing but most of us tonight have not thought about our breathing right you didn't have to force yourself to breathe you know prayer shouldn't it should be a normal response to a Believer yes absolutely fellowship with the Lord should be spontaneous it has not to be worked up it's not somebody to tell you you need to pray or your wife your husband or a friend or the pastor or the song Ministry shouldn't have to get you the place no let's pray let's pray it should be like breath spontaneous before the Lord did you know that yes you did but did you know that any interruptions of breath can come and you get to have a a medical emergency where maybe your heart or your lungs or other part of your body might suffer quite just a little bit you know brother random would preach a message about spiritual Amnesia but but I want to bring this forward to you in a thought that sometimes we have spiritual sleep apnea does everybody know what sleep apne is it's when you forget to breathe while you're sleeping and many times we as a Believer we come into this place where we just forget in our heaviness in our intoxication of this life our our our busy duties with our children raising our children we raised three children and my wife was very busy day in day out especially as as they were little growing and many times you know the fellowship with the Lord maybe wasn't there as it ought to be both man and wife because of busyness but the expectation of the Lord the key to success we now realize is prayer it is that key but let us not allow the intoxications of this world to bind us up for long periods of time because when we're bound up and we are ing ourselves without breath our spiritual lives are deteriorating with natural sleep AP you you come to a place where you forget to breathe while you're sleeping for a span of time but then before you note your body kicks in and it says to you if you don't breathe now you're going to die and suddenly you take this gasp of breath it's it's horrible and when you take that gasp your body responds and it comes back to life I find many times our spiritual lives are just that way we fall asleep and we get intoxicated we get under under under struggles and thoughts and and before you know we we have got to a place where we've spiritually stop breathing but something of trauma comes into our life and something way it happens that our minds come to remembrance oh God is still present and we do as we would gasp and we begin to pray But as time progresses and your normal breathing comes into play our humanness sets us back into Old bad habits and once again we forget the key to success and we forget that God is calling us to worship Him brother Bram would say this and he's speaking this message I am the resurrection and the life he's speaking this of Lazarus and you know who had no no Breath of Life in him he had died and brother bradam says like this and as soon as Jesus left the home sickness set in sorrow set in and listen Christians when Jesus leaves your home sickness and trouble will set right in behind it when he leaves your home get ready for trouble cuz it's on the road right then when we leave Jesus there is troubles I want to remind you Mary and Joseph they brought Jesus in and as they were traveling and they were going to do the there to Jerusalem what did they do they forgot Jesus on the way home yeah yeah the very ones that were caretakers of the of God himself on here on Earth as a little boy yeah they left him and they went on their Road for three days journey how did somebody ever do that you know I don't know a lot of you but maybe brother Steve mcney how about you lose where is he tonight how about you for there he is how about you and your wife forgetting your child someplace I mean it seems unheard of brother Robert but they left Jesus and how is it that you and I running this everyday life we too many times leave Jesus behind I want to encourage you tonight if there's any Ministry within me to give to you tonight I'm encouraging don't leave Jesus behind amen Fellowship I want to tell you takes relationship in order to have a good relationship with your spouse or with your friend you must build a relationship you must work at a relationship so relationships now I'm not just talking naturally now I'm talking about spiritually having a relationship with our lord Jesus it takes a lot of discipline a lot to work amen now making the relationship is easy but keeping the relationship is very difficult in order to have a a relationship with the Lord Jesus it's going to take energy energy to have a relationship with our Lord Jesus it's going to take a very unselfish act brother Brandon would say on this day of Calvary he would say look what Jesus turned and said in so much as you have done unto these you did it unto me unselfish life you don't give it a second thought your your thoughts are upon Christ you're not caring about your workout schedule you're not caring about your your eating schedule or what you need to do at Starbucks or buying the no your thoughts are Upon Jesus Christ the scripture would tell us in Romans chap 12:1 one he would say take my life a living sacrifice the furtherance of the scripture says take my life a living s which is holy and acceptable unto God which is my reasonable service yes amen it's not unreasonable the Lord doesn't find it unreasonable for you to lay yourself unselfishly down upon the altar yeah and Gifts God's gifts always find their places here again he says worship him then present your gift present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy and accept it present yourself you are the gift you are the one that God receives you are the gift to God we as the bride have presented ourselves unto our Lord Jesus Christ and she has opened her heart to him tonight have you opened your heart to Jesus is it that you just come to a service to put in time or is it you've come because you desired to have your heart wide open to to receive the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus doesn't want you to have closed doors tonight or he wants you to open your door he wants you to open every room of your house before him every door brother rer preaches a whole message of doors within a door doors and he tells us open every door in your life friends we got to sweep out all of our all of our unnecessary things out of our lives you know uh I apologize for using our example home examp examples a lot but you know sometimes how many's ever done some uh uh spring cleaning sometime and uh you do real well and I I got my wife she's a wonderful house uh clean and she keeps Everything clean she she's just so good but you know when spring time comes around and she says uh Steve we we we got to pull away the furniture right and you pull away the furniture and you move things around all of a sudden in the corners of the room are all kinds of these dust what we call dust bunnies come on I mean you're all looking at me like this never happens all right it just happens at my house praise God but there's all kinds of little dust bunnies how did they get there I thought we were such clean and organized people people how did they get there it's like that in our personal lives we come to church we read our Bibles we do the things that are expected of us we look as though we're clean and holy and acceptable to God which is our reasonable service but when you pull away the furniture sometimes and you open the door God begins to shine his light upon the corners of your household suddenly you begin to recognize that maybe there are some dust bunnies there that you know we're not talking about gross sins we're not talking about lost and fornication things and stealing no and smoking no we're talking about little things and brother Brown would tell us I believe it's in the the message of super sign that's the little things that get us it's the little things that spoil your Vine it's the little things that cut off your communication with God it's the little things things friends tonight that ruin your [Applause] success as a believer in Jesus Christ brother Brandy describes to us that our hearts our Our Lives ought to be like a three- room house and in our three- room house we we would we would have the the entrance of the kitchen and and it's typed there in into the outer court and inner Court and the holies of holies and all in this we see that we need to give our entire beings to God which SS to you and I that our bodies are unto Christ our spirit belongs to Christ Our soul is his throne room it's his control tower but Satan will make our human makeup to to fight against the very one that should enter into the realm of our body spirit and soul friends I believe that God controls all of our Lives year ago year ago years ago friends I I buried this old man years ago I laid him down into the grave and I said you're no longer wanted old man you're no longer wanted I want to have the mind of Jesus Christ I want the mind of Christ to come in my being and take care control of my body I want the mind of God to take care of my spirit faculties when the mind of God takes care of our spir hallelujah our spiritual facities we don't have to worry about these anxieties and depressions and things that so beset us in this hour the greatest battle that's happening right now is in our minds Satan D desires destroy your mind get you thinking on other things when God is saying I want you to think on me I want you to Fellowship about on me I want you to call upon me brother brandham speaks this in the message life of demons and Visions in 1951 he says and he's talking about how we're having these battles and how that our bodies we have struggles in our bodies to pray he says I went over there and not down do you ever feel like you know the the Bri uh briers stuck you and and the Flor was too hard did you ever have that that's the time to press on that's the devil trying to keep you from it move right on I just said thank you Lord and I kept on praying and after a while I got lost in the spirit once you're lost in his presence your life will declare Christ Sevenfold brother Brandon would tell us he would say you know if you take a triangle piece of glass and and you would you know you would shine a light on that glass well when the three parts meet he would say there there one place that you you would pass the light through and out from that light would come seven different colors and begin to speak that they were the seven colors of God knowing that the colors of God they symbolize Divine connection and when you are in fellowship with God your life will Sparkle when you you know your body is that Triune being Body Spirit and soul and when the light of his word when the light of his presence begins to shine shine upon your being you cannot but Sparkle the word you cannot but prophesy again your life begins to speak we could show forth in the Old Testament how the urum Thum would be there and they would speak a word to the urum Thum or some sort of word they felt was from the Lord and if it came from the Lord the the co the the the stones on the Yum Thum will begin to Sparkle and we know the word of God is is that yum Thum and and as our lives friends are presented unto the word and the word shines in our lives the seven colors the beauty of God begins to shine within our being brother Brandon would say in 196 God provided approach to Divine Fellowship he would say you're in the shakina glory with God fellowshipping with him what we need today brother is a worship under the blood a worship in complete relationship amen you need to be in full relationship you you need to be in full surrender you need to be a full sacrifice of God you need to be that one that lays thems in the presence of God absolutely you need to be in complete relationship with God what good is it to have all the mystery truths friends or have all these understandings when we have no relationship with Jesus Christ amen what what good with you is I come here today with that inspiration in my heart to preach to greater than all the prophets is here and we don't have relation with that great one yes our voice would be just a sounding symbol our voice would be just declaring like a loud trumpet and we'd all out our heads but God is trying to speak to somebody today enter into the closet with me enter into Fellowship enter into a relationship with me amen amen because I called you he said to be a royal a holy and royal priesthood 1 Peter 2:5 would say you also ye also as living stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer off up spiritual sacrifice this is our job this is our existence to offer up a spiritual sacrifice unto God acceptable to God by Jesus Christ Psalms 116:17 would say uh I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving Hallelujah Lord I want to stop just a moment and say thank you yes thank you for our lives Lord oh we want to praise you for healing brother Ron we want to thank you for stepping in for our other needs in the body Lord we want to give you a sacrifice of praise today amen we want to give him a praise of Glory he said call unto me when we've called unto him he will answer he's not quiet he's not mute he's not dead He's Alive I serve a risen savior yes sir wonderful Jeremiah 33:11 the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the voice of them that say praise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy endureth forever can you say that with me tonight his Mercy endureth forever our children our husbands our wives that have fallen they're not too far from God because his Mercy endure it forever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord friends God wants Lively Stones yes sir he wants joyful people amen come on brother brother and sister I'm not into acrobats and and all kinds of movements you know inside the church but I am here for giving God Praise Spiritual aerobics is not my finest but I want to give God praise yes when the spirit of the Lord moves on my being it is then I will dance as David danced when the spirit of the Lord moves upon me yes sir John said I I'm in the spirit on the Lord's day he is the Lord of The Savage he is the Lord of lords he's the Lord of my everything when I'm in my house I will praise him when I'm at my job I will praise him I will be a Lively Stone the joy of the Lord should be in his people the voice of Joy the voice of gladness The Voice of Praise yes sir this is what the people of God do and pray we're not in a morning celebration where we say well we got a priest we pray without ceasing and how and we get it no there's a joy in our hearts we're meeting with the King of Kings the Lord of lords he is your heavenly husband absolutely when a husband and wife are married they enjoy seeing one another and if you don't feel that expression towards one another we'd like to pray with you after the service but you know something people go cold in their relationships this is free the people go cold in their relationships why is it because they don't take time and the energy and the work it takes to make an a a lifelong joy in their marriage they just want momentary weekend satisfac action but God is calling to us as a wife I'm not interested in we can moment satisfaction I'm here for everyday praise I'm here for prayerful Fellowship you know Joy is a is a is a Divine Dimension to have real joy you must be locked into Christ and many times when we say the word joy we think about the joy that we just had at Christmas and we think about the joy that we would had in our birthday party or the joy that when we we just have a a human expression of Joy but joy is divine it's much deeper than any human expression that's right Joy is not Shackled by human circumstances Joy isn't the same as happiness happiness depends on circumstances but joy is the strength that Cometh From The Lord you know the the Hebrew word which I cannot pronounce but it means to LEAP or to spin around in pleasure the joy of the word gets in your being and you cannot help but rejoice it reminds me of the little example brother brandham gives about that little little creek or stream or however it was and and and the question was asked little little stream why why are you so happy spring little spring thank you brother what why are you so happy is it because a little rabbit comes or drink or is it cuz I come drink no he says because something is pushing I see tonight there's a lot of people that have some pushing something on the inside Christ on the inside pushing within our beings it is that joy that Divine Joy that's with inside of us amen beautiful this peace of God it ra radiates peace with a prayer life and with God moving and God having that relationship as you should have with him you begin to have peace in your life I want to tell you like this without the contact of God worries set in yes without contact of God fears set in anxieties set in and they begin to overtake us right when Jesus he's come and he's spoken into into our lives not just around our lives but into our lives peace be still a lot of us have got worries in our life and we and and listen worries is kind of like a rocking chair you get into that rocking chair and it gives you something to do but you never go anywhere for Ron do you have a rocking chair I think this last week he rocked and went nowhere that's what worry is like sometimes worry is and fear they're Illustrated like water it begins to trick in a small trickle of doubt that creeps into your mind it all starts in your mind and and if it's if it's not stop it still soon becomes a stream of fear which creates a pond of paranoia yeah which begins to overflow and makes a river of distress and then it develops in your own raging torrent of tension and before you know it now this is for you because I came to Arizona before you know it it's caused a Grand Canyon to be car D in your life it's a deep Canyon before you know you don't know what to do with it it's anxiety and that's why we have so many young people wanting to take their lives even in the message it should never be heard of it why because we're creating an atmosphere where they can jump and move but they never get into prayer they come to the Altar and we shout at them we shout at them lots of noise lots of noise but they never get to pray sometimes there needs to be some quietness where we even tell the musicians just tone it down just a little bit you on the guitars you on the drums just tone it down just a there's a birth that's going to happen [Music] here listen in a birthing room you don't want all kinds of noise you don't want all kinds of shouting and all kinds of things can you imagine my wife giving birth and I'm yelling at her yeah yeah hope nobody's offended at me tonight but you know something we had some nice music playing it was a soft kind holy and beautiful and and I whispered and I say you can have this child it'll be born of you you'll be okay the long Lord has promised us why don't we get to the place where our young people get here and they're snotting and they're crying a real Born Again experience with God I I don't believe in I'm not against that any real minister of God reads the message like we do we're not against that Holy Ghost spirit of God moving in our in our midst and in our beings and causes our people to have a real Born Again experience with them but get them to a place where that little that little that little uh chicken within the egg can beak its way out can poke its way out poke poke poke poke poke we don't have to help that little guy if we help him out he's going to die amen but create an atmosphere the people begin to pray in the household of faith they begin to reach out their arms seeing that little one that's come oh God we we've had fellowship with you we know you this little one needs to have this experience oh God would you find them at the altar today that we would find our children not struggling with depression come on fears and anxieties amen brother brand would say in the resurrection of Jesus he said the human heart was made to be happy amen worry causes cancer temper will cause cancer don't ever be upset just walk in his life I how brother Steve I not be upset you've got to pray you know wrong and hasty decisions are made when you don't get on your knees first and pray many times husbands I I I just like you and I'm just the same we we got something in our mind and we we Walts into the house and we're sometimes like Bulls in the china cabinet and we haven't gone before the Lord and we say we're going to do it this way and we're going to do it that way we're going to we go and before you know it everything's an uproar but if we would have taken just that extra few moments and went to our closet just for a moment got down our knees and said Lord Jesus I don't want to upset this household I don't want to upset things going I need to have your wisdom I need to speak the words from my mouth that will turn away wrath don't ever be upset just walk in his love knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's neither power things present things future nothing can separate us from him amen Jeremiah 21:1 for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not evil to give you an expected end call unto me and I will hear you amen amen I trust that you could just give me a couple more minutes I asked myself while I Was preparing this message I I asked myself and I asked the Lord why why don't Believers pray I mean we we know we ought to pray I I mean we we've read it hundreds of times we're Believers today we listen to the tapes we hear what the prophet why don't we pray and these things came to my heart and I wrote them down sometimes it's guilt associated with unconfessed sin you get before the Lord before you know the devil's a great accuser of the Brethren and it comes back into your memory and instead of repenting your pride stands in your way pride comes before the fall amen and instead of saying Lord I throw up my hands and I Repent Lord I give you all of this feeling I give you this guilt what do we do we walk away from the very thing that can provide life and Liberty to us many times we feel unworthy oh brother so and so is more worthy than I sister so and so I am unworthy Christ has made you worthy amen you see I'm trying to to express this words to minister unto you so that you move forward and if the Lord shall tar into the next year that you'll move forward and as the ministry here is preaching to you such good word you will move forward and you will be success amen that's your your children will come back to the Lord amen that your husbands your wives amen amen friends I just want to stop here for just a moment I don't know anything but it just came to my heart listen Church problems won't happen when we're praying all right yes when you're praying Lord and you're striking your breast and you're saying Lord Jesus help me to know you more you're not busy looking at everybody else's [Applause] faults brother didn't shake my hand Pastor said that a little bit too rough I think I'm going to leave church I'm going to do something else no your heart is in prayer asking the Lord to help those that you don't understand did you know that not everybody's perfect that comes to church wow shocking news huh it's all imperfect people that come to the house of God and we all make mistakes and we all say things harly harshly sometimes but we need to have Lord have mercy on me we need to have Grace for one another look beyond our faults look beyond the other brother's faults look about all the but oh look upon the need and the fellowship we need with God and call for your need call for your Brothers need amen we'll find success yes amen yes sometimes we don't pray because of our laziness because of our just neglect brother BR would say like this in the true sign that's overlooked he would say the people won't read they don't care to read they won't pray because they're got other things to do they can't take time to pray and the Bible is boredom Bome to them it hasn't got enough action there's not enough entertainment in it I've heard the stories over and over again he's going there again oh my too boring not enough action for these modern days or any day think of it now we don't have time to go every down every corner but I want to tell you now sometimes we don't pray because of excessive sorrow we are hurting people sometimes in this Christmas season there are some that have come together as family to Worship the Lord I Believe In Worship I don't believe in Christmas I Believe In Worship amen me too and they've come together as families to Worship the Lord but there's somebody empty there's a seat empty at the table because they've lost a loved one yes there's somebody there that's feeling so full of sorrowful because maybe they're under a juniper tree yes brother Brandon would tell us of his own life experience in a life story he would say and just as I look down to where here come a black sheep moving down and I I knew what it that it was I knew she was going I looked over at her like that he's talking about now his little girl going and he says and her little mouth be coming open her eyes crossed over and I said Sherry you know you know Daddy honey and she was making a little funny noise and and I laid my hand over her head then Satan moved to me and said will you trust him now excessive sorrow will you trust him now I laid my hand on her and said God you gave her to me you are taking her away from me blessed be the name of the Lord said God I can't deny you how many would say with me in this quotation brother brandom had the joy of the Lord because it wasn't about circumstances it wasn't about what he was feeling at the moment it was about God moving on the inside of the inside did brother Brandon go through J Tree experiences yes did other prophets yes do you go through them yes but God is Victorious for those who call yes sir he says I can't say that you are unjust I I duly deserve all this this punishment you are still just and I still love you I will serve you with all my heart now to my baby Lord I've begged you I've tried to get you to keep her but nonetheless not my will let your will be done amen I think in our excessive sorrow times we ought to pray that way Lord I so desire that you would move for this situation but God Let It Be Your Will and no matter what your decision yes or no I will praise [Applause] you brother Bram tells us what so sorrow and God's way that's been made for us he says when you got sorrow in your home go meet Jesus you got sickness in your home go meet Jesus got heartache in your home go go meet Jesus if you got a need for anything go meet Jesus go meet him he's got all the remedy everything there he ain't got the he ain't got the remedy he's got the Cure Thank You Lord For the Cure it's not just a remedy if it's just a remedy we can get sick again but no he's got the Cure Isaiah 35 ver vers 10 would say therefore the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come into Zion with songs of everlasting Joy upon their head and they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away if there's somebody here today or hearing the sound of my voice sometime another time and you are focusing upon extreme sorrow give it to Jesus Jesus give it to Jesus got sickness give it to Jesus you need to have a surgery give it to Jesus whatever it is give it to him he's the director of your path he's your wayall strong late I'd like to close on this have you ever been afraid that he might not answer your prayer yes sir it's very real I don't know I prayed and I'm not sure he's going to answer but let me give you a truth scripture something that will fortify you Matthew chapter 6 The last part of verse 8 it says for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before you ask them so this is the confidence this is the faith we have he knows before you even ask god brother Bram lays it out so simply in the teaching of Moses he says but little boy and little girl brother Bram is just slaying it all simply he says little boy and little girls does God hear prayer little boys and little girls say yes he hears prayer does God answer prayer yes yeah does he answer real quick not all the time does he no sometimes he makes us wait can you say that word wait is that the time to give up on him when every promise that he's ever given us he has fulfilled and everything he's ever showed us he has worked with has he healed you before will he do it again but we have to wait sometimes is that right yes but God answers prayer doesn't he and just because everything is going wrong that's no sign we should be should quit praying we just pray on anyhow don't we that's right now you answered right God answers prayer let let us all say it together God answers prayer yes no matter what the circumstance are he answers call unto me and I will answer call unto me and I will answer he will answer and he will open the truth of his word for us in that season and in that time thank you Lord Psalms 4:3 but know the Lord has set apart The Godly for himself the Lord hears when I call to him Psalms 18:6 in my distress I call upon the Lord to my God I cried for help for his Temple he uh he heard my voice and my cry to him reaches his here word well let's pull up Daniel for a witness Daniel did the Lord hear your call well I had to wait 21 days but the word of the Lord came to him said the very day you called y amen I heard what you call for and I sent for the angels of God I sent forth fortification I sent forth for your help and brother Brandon would say at the right appointed time he sent down the angel he sent down that one to go and fix the situation amen amen sometimes we have to sit in the hospital and wait sometimes we have to sit in our room and wait sometimes we have to wait for our loved ones but we keep on waiting because his promises are fulfilled Hallelujah yes thank you Lord don't let your imaginations get the better of you thank you the Bible would tell us by Paul in 2 Corinthians 101 5 casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ if you have a negative thought that comes through their mind it's not of [Music] God you know it's the most times where the brand focused around healing and sickness and often times the devil would come in and speak to the people and tell them the negative thought against healing and brother Brandon would have to help them so their faith would increase but we've come along down the road quite a bit and we have recognized who we are we recognize uh who we have come to we recognize that we are adopted sons of God we don't have to cower anymore to the devil speak the word it is written Satan you've stood in here in this parlor too long give back my inheritance this belongs to me yes cast down your imaginations many times we go to reasoning cast down the reasonings cast them down God don't want to have reasonings reasonings always to find their way Faith does not Faith believes faith has Bulldog hair on its chest faith is at six sense my brother and I leave you in this if you desire for God to move in your situation pray and believe amen yes yes he's never failed you use your imagination and your memories for good things for just a moment here imagine and see your body healed amen amen step into it too many people lay on their beds and they see themselves dying already way down the corridor they see themselves as a dead man and who's going to be at my funeral and how's it going to be and what songs are we going to play no step in to something of Christ and see in the vision he desires good for you he desires he for you he desires that you might live A full life amen yes brother the Lord has numbered your days not the devil I know I'm pointing to brother Ron but this is the most crucial thing that you know of today the devil couldn't take brother Ron's life why the Lord has determined his years he slipped beond I heard the testimony he he got into a realm but he couldn't see their faces why he was in your time there's people in this pasture that need a Shepherd it's not time for that but God knows the season and the hour so let's not have negative thoughts let's go home and say well brother R looks pretty weak you know brother R this brother r that man he could die any no he stepped into his [Applause] promise yes this evening I should have sat down he was on a roll preaching yeah he said he's just maybe putting on the Jersey we just wait till New Year's evening amen he's ready to toss the football why why are you this way why is he why because the the Bride of Jesus Christ has stepped into her position greater than Solomon is just not around us he's in us live by faith cast down the reasoning live to the six sense that God has called us we got to have some endurance God give us good quality to have endurance God give us the ability to come to that that judge as we were reading in Luke that one that neither knew God or knew he didn't didn't care for man or God that one of scripture and that little woman came and kept on knocking kept on bothering him the Hebrew room word for that word bother means to like poke him in the eye yeah she was an annoyance yeah yeah yes
