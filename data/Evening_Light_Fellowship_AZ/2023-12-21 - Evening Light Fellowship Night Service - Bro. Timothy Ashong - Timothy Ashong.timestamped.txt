[36:55] 27
[36:57] and they told him and
[37:01] said we came onto the land whether thou
[37:05] sentest
[37:06] us and
[37:08] surely it floweth with milk and
[37:13] fr and this is the fruit of
[37:18] it
[37:20] nevertheless the people be strong that D
[37:26] in the land
[37:28] and the cities are
[37:31] W and very
[37:34] great
[37:35] moreover we saw the children of anak
[37:40] there the
[37:42] amalekites dwell in the land of the
[37:45] South and the
[37:47] Hittites and the jebusites and the
[37:50] amorites dwell in the
[37:53] mountains and the Canaanites dwell by
[37:57] the Sea and by the coast of
[38:01] Jordan and Caleb steal the people before
[38:05] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[38:10] possess it for we are well able to
[38:15] overcome it
[38:16] amen but the man that went up with him
[38:20] said we be not able to go against the
[38:24] people for they are stronger than
[38:27] we and they brought up an evil report of
[38:31] the land which they had SE unto the
[38:35] children of Israel saying the land
[38:39] through which we had gone to set it is a
[38:43] land that eated up the inhabitants
[38:46] thereof and all the people that we saw
[38:50] in it were men of great
[38:54] stature and there we saw the GI Giants
[38:57] the sons of
[38:59] anak which came of the
[39:02] Giants and we were in our own sight as
[39:06] Grasshoppers and so we were in their
[39:10] sight amen let's read from Isaiah
[39:14] chapter
[39:19] 45 Isaiah
[39:23] 45:22 look unto me and be ye
[39:28] saved all the ends of the Earth for I am

[39:54] amen and uh
[39:57] I'm also thankful to almighty God that I
[40:01] am standing here this
[40:03] evening and behind the sacri
[40:06] vest last year by this time I was very
[40:09] sick I had surgery and prostrate surgery
[40:14] cancer and
[40:16] uh it was very
[40:19] tough last year by this time I was
[40:22] wearing
[40:24] ceter I could not even PE
[40:28] for 9 months I was wearing
[40:32] C before I left Ghana to come to the US

[40:39] been to the doctors and they check me
[40:41] and they said oh your prostrate has
[40:44] become too big and uh I did different
[40:47] test and then the doctor said um and
[40:50] there is cancer in this spot and okay
[40:54] but don't have to worry just I said no I
[40:57] was not
[40:59] worried because when he just mentioned
[41:01] cancer the only thing that came to me do
[41:05] you fear
[41:08] cancer I remember what the prophet
[41:11] thought and then he told us there is no
[41:15] virtue in
[41:18] fear so I didn't
[41:21] fear because there is no virtue in it
[41:24] right and then I have to take a lot of
[41:28] pain medications and oh for sleepless
[41:32] night I was M weeks I was I was not
[41:35] sleeping day I was not sleeping it was
[41:38] just
[41:39] unbearable until some of the brothers
[41:42] got to hear about it but very coffee and
[41:44] the rest and they said no brother
[41:45] Timothy if you can travel out just leave
[41:47] and come we have doctors here that can
[41:50] help we do what we can do so I flew to
[41:54] the US and then uh I after to I thought
[41:56] I was just going to camp and then I stay
[41:59] 9 months
[42:00] here and uh by this time last year I was
[42:05] I've just had a surgy the surgy was in
[42:07] November yeah 14th of November and uh
[42:11] after that it was successful and then
[42:14] after uh I had some complications and
[42:20] uh infections and
[42:24] uh it it was difficult at a point that I
[42:28] could not
[42:29] even I could not even
[42:34] walk I have to use the Walker to be
[42:38] walking in pain I could not even lift my
[42:41] leg like this from one step to come here
[42:45] and to take
[42:47] here they almost have to carry me to put
[42:50] me in the
[42:52] car but by the grace of almighty God
[42:55] Amen I I'm standing here

[43:19] amen amen and this evening just speaking
[43:21] to us I just want us to encourage our
[43:24] Say by keep your eyes on the promise

[43:37] the doctor want to see if the stitches
[43:40] is healed inside what it cut whatever
[43:43] they did
[43:44] there and then I went and they did it
[43:47] and then I have to go back to the doctor
[43:49] and they said oh it's not completely
[43:51] healed come back in they give me another
[43:53] 10 days so in two weeks I went back
[43:57] and so I went on the table to be they do

[44:29] and she was standing there they tried to
[44:34] give me some dreams and but it at that
[44:37] time said all my system was shutting
[44:40] down K everything was going
[44:43] down but the grace of God came
[44:46] again
[44:47] Hallelujah that until God has finished
[44:50] with a man nothing can take him out of
[44:53] here right I don't know what your
[44:57] condition is what your challenges are
[45:00] but what I've said to you that trust in
[45:02] the
[45:05] Lord God praise the name of the
[45:08] Lord and I said to the Lord I said
[45:11] whatever I go I will
[45:13] testify amen I said I will testify to
[45:17] The Shame of the devil and I will
[45:20] testify the glory of the
[45:22] [Applause]
[45:24] king because if God does something for
[45:26] us he wanted to
[45:29] testify it is very important for God
[45:33] that whatever it does for us no matter
[45:36] how you think it's small no matter what
[45:38] it is it might be small to you but it's
[45:41] not small to
[45:42] God so remember whatever God does for
[45:46] you and to you let us give glory to the
[45:49] king
[45:51] amen even for us to be alive we should
[45:53] be thankful to God for for you to be
[45:56] able to eat you should be thankful to
[45:58] God because there are people who cannot
[45:59] eat they cannot even swallow their own
[46:02] Sala they can't do it they cannot move
[46:05] and if God has been good to us we should
[46:08] be full and SE with joy and praises to
[46:12] the king of glory Let's
[46:15] A
[46:24] Hallelujah
[47:10] with my sister and the son that we were
[47:12] living
[47:15] with so just myself and my wife was home
[47:20] and a brother that was close to us that
[47:22] we could fall upon who he has been
[47:24] helping us with was 45 minutes drive
[47:29] away and so if this issue that I had at
[47:34] that time happened at home it would have
[47:37] been difficult for us because my wife
[47:39] would not have known even what to do and
[47:42] we were just strangers in the area but
[47:45] we have gone to the hospital and so
[47:47] right before the doctors this didn't
[47:49] happened and I said to Satan you miss it
[47:54] again his land
[47:57] fil because God is there amen so my
[48:01] brothers and sisters nothing happens
[48:05] accidentally the enemy will fight but
[48:07] God is on our side so we'll come out we
[48:10] win the
[48:12] battle Hallelujah and so I have to stay
[48:16] when they did the surgery they said
[48:18] robotic surgery so when they did it the
[48:21] next day I was discharged from the
[48:23] hospital but when I had this sh change I
[48:26] have to stay six days in the
[48:32] emergency praise the Lord the Lord is
[48:35] good am and it was blood
[48:40] infection call EOL or whatever they said
[48:43] it was BR in so why that they were
[48:44] trying to find out what antibiotics what
[48:47] to use what to use but through all God
[48:51] pulled me out he brought me through God
[48:55] is faithful
[48:58] am let's continue to trust him let's
[49:01] continue to look up to
[49:04] him it came to a place as I said I could
[49:07] not even
[49:08] walk when I have to sit in car they have
[49:11] to manage and I sit backward and then
[49:13] they have to leave in pains to place it
[49:16] in put it in the
[49:19] car it was very difficult but what was
[49:22] always I was confessing keep on saying
[49:26] this also shall
[49:31] pass this also shall
[49:36] pass because God is
[49:40] faithful and
[49:42] then after all 9 month they have to take
[49:46] the the
[49:49] C and when they did it even before then
[49:53] even if I lie down I could not turn this
[49:55] way
[49:56] I could not end this way I have to just
[49:58] be lying down like this if I see them I
[50:01] could not get up they have to pull me
[50:03] out all just difficult
[50:06] situation but the Lord saw me through
[50:10] all and so whatever you might be going
[50:13] through he will see you
[50:15] through sometime when we have challenges
[50:18] and trials then we wonder and we
[50:20] question why
[50:23] me why should I suffer I believe believe
[50:25] in God I trust in God I am faithful yeah
[50:29] you are faithful and that is why the tri
[50:33] come to show that you are faithful
[50:37] amen and the prophet of God said The
[50:39] more lawyer you are the more the
[50:43] test and it's not easy to go through
[50:45] trials and challenges but it is all for
[50:48] our testimony am when you are going
[50:51] through difficulties it's not easy but
[50:53] when it is over and you are testifying
[50:56] oh somebody wish miss it but there's a
[51:00] price to
[51:01] pay so dear
[51:03] ones God lost all of us and he cares for
[51:08] all of us and he has a reason and he has
[51:11] a purpose for every one of us so it's
[51:15] not good to look at somebody and try to
[51:18] compare yourself to somebody say why me
[51:22] why don't you why not you
[51:29] why don't
[51:31] you praise the name of the Lord so when
[51:34] you come to why me why this and that
[51:37] Satan build you be a complex that's
[51:40] right and then you come to pity
[51:44] yourself and then it comes that oh I God
[51:49] love somebody more than
[51:51] me and self pity is sin
[51:57] and then we should also remember that we
[52:00] are made differently for different
[52:04] purposes we are safe we are all safe
[52:09] different way God brought the light to
[52:12] us and we are all uniqu and so our
[52:16] trials and challenges are
[52:19] unique what will be a trial to you will
[52:21] not be a trial to
[52:24] somebody
[52:26] and what will be a trial to somebody
[52:27] will not be a trial to
[52:29] you son through the blood I mean son
[52:33] through the fire some through great
[52:35] sorrow some through difficulties but all
[52:37] through the
[52:39] blood so our trials differently
[52:41] differently differently but we all go
[52:43] through the
[52:45] blood so don't compare yourself to
[52:48] anybody whatever God ordained and
[52:52] chooses that I should go through and you
[52:54] should go through we ask for Grace to be
[52:58] faithful and I used to share with the
[53:00] people like if you read in the
[53:02] scriptures they had different Brothers
[53:05] there just a little example Peter one
[53:08] day was in prison sleeping among Two
[53:12] Soldiers and the angel of the Lord came
[53:14] down midnight because the Breen were
[53:17] praying before then we read in the
[53:20] scripture that Herod has already killed
[53:22] some of the Believers and he saw that
[53:24] the to which people were happy so he
[53:27] went ahead and took
[53:28] p and his intention was to kill him but
[53:32] the Believers were praying and midnight
[53:35] the angel of the Lord
[53:37] descended and I said to the Brethren the
[53:40] angel did not descend at midnight
[53:42] because he was afraid of the
[53:44] day and when he came he was not working
[53:47] like this in the
[53:49] prison no he was in
[53:52] charge he was in absolute control
[53:55] thr the soldiers were sleeping and he
[53:58] wake Peter
[54:00] up the chains fell off because of the
[54:04] presence of the
[54:06] Angel and may your chains fall off from
[54:09] you because of the presence of the
[54:11] anointed word of God because of the
[54:14] Angel of the Lord hallelujah the doors
[54:17] open on their own and he made a way for
[54:20] them to go out and whatever doors might
[54:22] be closed against you may God open it
[54:25] for you to be
[54:29] free he's mindful of
[54:32] us and he cares for
[54:35] us there was Apostle Paul and Silas that
[54:40] were also arrested for the same Gospel
[54:42] of Jesus Christ amen and the Bible told
[54:45] us that they were thrown also into
[54:47] jail after they have been
[54:50] beaten beaten and they were
[54:53] bleeding and they true them to
[54:56] J but the Bible told us Paul and Salas
[55:00] begin to
[55:02] sing they begin to worship
[55:05] God they sank until the other prisoners
[55:08] heard them
[55:09] singing so in your challenges in your
[55:12] trials you have to choose what to do you
[55:16] can sit that and
[55:18] mour and cry and be against and become
[55:22] FY and fight everybody around you
[55:26] or you can choose to love the Lord like
[55:29] somebody said to brother Bram you are
[55:30] Antichrist you are this and brother Bram
[55:33] said if that be the will of my father
[55:36] for me he said that's fine he said I
[55:39] want to do his will if he wants me to go
[55:42] to hell after everything he said even in
[55:45] hell I will love him
[55:48] hallah if he choose for me to be sick or
[55:52] have a challenge he allows it to come I
[55:55] will still love
[55:58] it I will still praise
[56:02] Him Paul and Silas were
[56:05] beaten and they choose to be praising
[56:08] God in
[56:10] prison as they continue to praise the
[56:13] Lord the praising doors
[56:17] open there is power in
[56:20] praises the pra door open they could
[56:23] have run out but they
[56:26] didn't they could have said Peter run
[56:28] out the angel brought Peter out this is
[56:30] no you have to know the purpose for your
[56:36] life you have to
[56:39] know why I am
[56:42] here because there is a purpose for
[56:45] everything so Paul and Silas could have
[56:48] gone because the doors were open but
[56:51] they
[56:53] stay
[56:56] they are going to prison was for a
[56:58] purpose whatever God allows is for a
[57:05] purpose and we must always pray for the
[57:08] purpose of God let me recognize let me
[57:11] know whatever is happening around us
[57:14] there is a purpose for
[57:21] it God has not forsaken you
[57:28] God has not forsaken you and it's not
[57:30] because God doesn't hear prayer he hears
[57:32] prayer he answers prayer and I want you
[57:35] to remember again that Faith also
[57:38] endures
[57:41] yes not always jump at Faith endures yes
[57:46] that's why the Bible tells us in the
[57:47] book of
[57:48] Hebrews 11 that others refuse
[57:53] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[57:55] better
[57:58] Resurrection he said if they had been
[58:00] mindful they would have gone back but
[58:02] these people claim that they were
[58:04] strangers and pregrant and they said we
[58:06] pled allegiance to the Lamb of God we
[58:09] will not
[58:11] go they offered them Liberty Freedom If
[58:14] Only They would deny the cause of Christ
[58:17] they said no we will not do
[58:20] that may the Lord help us hallelujah
[58:26] Paul and Salas stay in the prison until
[58:29] the morning
[58:30] came and when the officer saw in the
[58:34] morning that the doors were open he look
[58:37] around and look around and he want to
[58:39] kill himself he want to take us to kill
[58:41] his because I believe that officer might
[58:43] have seen a lot of jail breaks people
[58:46] running out of jail and if you are an
[58:48] officer in charge and the fellow goes
[58:50] out then you have to take his
[58:53] place you have to answer you have to be
[58:56] try and he wanted to cut off his life
[58:59] then Paul and Sil said no don't do it
[59:04] don't kill
[59:06] yourself we are still
[59:09] here maybe you might find yourself in a
[59:11] situation that you don't know what to do
[59:13] and the devil will bring all kinds of
[59:15] thoughts in your mind leave the church
[59:18] kill yourself do this and do this
[59:21] no don't do it God is still in there God
[59:25] is still mindful God is still careful
[59:28] for you God Is Watching Over You God has
[59:30] a purpose so don't destroy yourself and
[59:34] be miserable and sit down and cry and
[59:36] want no end your life no you didn't give
[59:40] yourself life somebody give you
[59:45] life praise the name of the
[59:48] Lord we are
[59:53] here you there
[59:56] yes the next thing we he the man said
[1:00:00] what shall I do to be
[1:00:03] saved the reason they went to prison was
[1:00:06] for that man and his
[1:00:11] family God when he has brought us out
[1:00:15] the prophet said he can commit it to
[1:00:16] suffering to any
[1:00:18] challenge once you are okay he has
[1:00:21] finished with you he has a work and you
[1:00:24] know this my son this my child this my
[1:00:26] daughter is fine he can choose any maybe
[1:00:28] through your suffering through your
[1:00:30] difficulties somebody will come to know
[1:00:32] the Lord through your challenges through
[1:00:35] your trials somebody will come to know
[1:00:38] the
[1:00:41] Lord may the Lord help us
[1:00:46] hallelujah trust in the Lord and keep
[1:00:49] your eyes on the promise knowing that
[1:00:52] the steps of the righteous are of the
[1:00:55] Lord knowing that nothing can happen to
[1:00:59] any of us
[1:01:00] accidentally knowing that God cares for
[1:01:04] us he has a promise and he has a purpose
[1:01:07] for your life so keep your eyes on the
[1:01:11] promise not on yourself not on your
[1:01:15] trials not on your afflictions let your
[1:01:18] ey be on the promise of God because God
[1:01:22] and His word is the same so your eye
[1:01:25] must be on the Lord and in the book of
[1:01:28] Isaiah he said look unto me all ye ends
[1:01:31] of the Earth in this hour we are living
[1:01:34] in in this troublous world when there is
[1:01:38] so much fear and panic on the land
[1:01:40] nobody can tell what the next day is
[1:01:42] going to be nobody can explain it what
[1:01:45] is happening what leaders are confused
[1:01:48] nations are trouble there is distress
[1:01:50] among the nation there is a lot of
[1:01:52] difficulties but in this hour God caus

[1:05:54] don't look at your
[1:05:56] neighbor look to the
[1:05:59] Lord when you look at yourself you
[1:06:04] fail there is something about what you
[1:06:07] look
[1:06:09] at Prophet said the eye is an
[1:06:13] outlet to the soul so there is something
[1:06:16] about what you look at that affect your
[1:06:18] life if it is not so why do they
[1:06:21] advertise everything on Big Boss yeah
[1:06:24] why did I do

[1:06:31] at
[1:06:33] ah oh this is there like this I don't
[1:06:36] know sometime you go out you have not
[1:06:40] even prepared to buy some but you just
[1:06:41] look at it you want to buy
[1:06:44] it because there is something about what
[1:06:47] you look
[1:06:48] at what caused the fall is because if
[1:06:52] look and saw the three was good yes am
[1:06:57] what she saw is what brought us into
[1:07:01] this
[1:07:02] condition so God said look unto me keep
[1:07:07] your eyes on God keep your eyes on the
[1:07:10] word look at the word whatever happens
[1:07:13] around look to the word before you react
[1:07:17] before you do anything look to the word
[1:07:20] what does the word say what does God
[1:07:22] says amen
[1:07:27] praise the name of the Lord are we
[1:07:30] together there is something about what
[1:07:32] you look at yes in the Book of Genesis
[1:07:35] Chapter 30 Jacob did something there in
[1:07:38] the
[1:07:39] Bible when leban he and the
[1:07:41] father-in-law they were having some
[1:07:42] challenges Jacob said I've work for you
[1:07:45] you don't want to pay me okay it's okay
[1:07:47] I'm going to pay you now when we the
[1:07:49] animals give bir all that as Speckles
[1:07:51] and colors you will be that will be
[1:07:53] yours
[1:07:55] okay I hear so he made a trick there
[1:07:59] something that I don't know how he did
[1:08:00] it the Bible he took some pranks pop
[1:08:03] trees and then strick here and there and
[1:08:06] there and he fixed it in a way that when
[1:08:10] the animals come to give birth to
[1:08:12] conceive they they look at those things
[1:08:16] they look at those tricks and and they
[1:08:17] conceive the very
[1:08:21] color Genesis 30 you can go good and see
[1:08:24] is there so there is something about
[1:08:27] what you look
[1:08:30] at the if I come to your office let me
[1:08:33] see the music and let me see the
[1:08:40] books
[1:08:44] today many on
[1:08:47] the there are so many voices and they
[1:08:50] are all calling for
[1:08:51] attention he said there will never a
[1:08:54] voice that work attended to as the voice
[1:08:57] of the spirit e that up and hear Let Him
[1:09:01] hear what the spirit
[1:09:06] is us to look to him with all the
[1:09:09] distraction that is going on with all
[1:09:12] the challenges that is going on with all
[1:09:15] the scientific achievement that is going
[1:09:17] on with all the medical stuff that is
[1:09:20] going on with all the doctors and
[1:09:22] everything that we have God said look

[1:18:42] people call heresy that is the way we
[1:18:44] worship the god of our father and I
[1:18:46] always tell people look the only way you
[1:18:48] can serve God is to lose your
[1:18:50] mind lose your mind and get the mind of
[1:18:54] Christ because you can never please God
[1:18:57] with your own mind we need his mind so
[1:19:01] let this mind which was in Christ be in
[1:19:03] you that's what the church need that we
[1:19:07] can forsake our own way and forsake our
[1:19:09] thought and forsake our feelings and
[1:19:11] forsake the way we look at things and
[1:19:13] take what it
[1:19:15] says that's right that's why K can say
[1:19:19] yes they went to the land and yes they
[1:19:21] saw the anist there and yes they saw the
[1:19:23] and the Amit and the jebusites and all

[1:21:34] look at that promise he said we are well
[1:21:37] able to overcome we are able to take it
[1:21:41] because God said

[1:22:26] believe
[1:22:28] that and Joshua believe he his reason
[1:22:32] and he had to the prise because God said
[1:22:35] as I was with Moses I will be with you I
[1:22:39] will not fail you and nothing can stand
[1:22:42] before you no man stand before you all
[1:22:45] the days of your life he believed that
[1:22:47] promise he had on to that promise when
[1:22:50] the art was against him when Theos was
[1:22:53] so great his eyes was on the promise and
[1:22:56] the words of Jero
[1:23:00] fell any around you can also fall any

[1:23:16] Lord Jesus what are you looking at
[1:23:19] today let me just read a little the
[1:23:22] prophecy said here and
[1:23:25] then it was Joshua he Ste the people and
[1:23:29] said we are more than able to possess it
[1:23:33] we have more than able because why he
[1:23:37] was looking at the promise he
[1:23:40] was a true Seed of Abraham regardless of
[1:23:45] what the opposition was we can possess
[1:23:49] the gate because God promised the land
[1:23:58] amen the Christian doesn't look at the
[1:24:02] circumstances he looks at the word and
[1:24:05] stands still God says so that settles it
[1:24:10] what if Abraham had looked at the
[1:24:13] circumstances What If Abraham our father
[1:24:15] had looked at the
[1:24:18] circumstances Sarah was old he was old
[1:24:24] the Bible say they were we stricken in
[1:24:27] age but God gave the
[1:24:30] promise God told him out of Isaac your
[1:24:33] SE shall be called after 100 years and
[1:24:37] over God said to Abraham go and
[1:24:39] sacrifice your son
[1:24:41] Isaac your son that you love sacrifice
[1:24:43] him for
[1:24:45] me he didn't in
[1:24:49] question you might not understand or
[1:24:51] might have understood no God said it
[1:24:53] it's okay we want to we want everything
[1:24:56] to be explained to
[1:24:58] us everything must be explained before
[1:25:01] we act it nothing was explained to
[1:25:04] Abraham all the explanation is take your
[1:25:06] son and go and sacrifice him for me
[1:25:09] where I will show you to go go there and
[1:25:11] sacrifice and Abraham believed God
[1:25:14] hallelujah Abraham believed God it took
[1:25:16] his son and he wait as God said listen

[1:25:22] with us that we all read apart from the
[1:25:25] Bible we have we' had the the the
