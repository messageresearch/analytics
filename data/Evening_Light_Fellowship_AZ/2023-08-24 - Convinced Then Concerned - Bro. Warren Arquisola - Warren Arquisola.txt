chapter 1 verse 35 through 41. amen 35 again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus and he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus then Jesus turned and saw saw them following and said unto them watseki they said unto him Rabbi which is say being interpreted Master where dwell is thou he said unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode him with him that day for it was about 10th hour so it's about four o'clock in the afternoon one of the two which heard John spake and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first finded his own brother Simon and said unto him we have found the Messiah amen or we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ how many of you of you found him amen I found him 27 years ago and it's still fresh in my heart amen let's bow our heads father bless your word tonight speak to my lips Lord and use me as a vessel father for your own glory in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have a seat amen praise the Lord so convince and then concerned you cannot concern somebody if you're not convinced I was a Salesman before and I need to convince the people to my product and I will do some kind of tricks some kind of action so that people will see will will attracted first to me and then to my product and then I will I I was a frying uh pan and I will you know I will cook the the uh corn without oil and you can see the sound of the Corn Flakes or the the how do you call it the the popcorn amen and everybody I was uh the best salesman of uh frying pan so then I went to when I was uh uh uh a young man uh I was a gambler and then I uh if you can show the photo brother uh the map and if you can turn the lights off here okay so I was working here in a big city Manila and I there was a festival in on the south here so this is where brother Mario lives Bacolod and I went here and my hands shaking and I will hold okay like that so I went there from here to there and uh there was a big uh they called that Derby so it's uh fights rooster fights and I lost my money I'm not a good Gambler I was not a good gambler so when I lost my money hold on to that map when I lost my money now here am I no money in my pocket I was looking for a I cannot ride in a taxi cab no money no dinero so I went to I went to this uh uh bicycle Guy this is the the cheapest one it's only one peso that time and then this guy showed me the scripture this brother was if you if you see brother on maybe you saw that bicycle with a sidecar the the this kind of profession is the lowest profession in the Philippines you don't need to go to school to to become a a bicycle driver but this guy showed the scripture he had a a Bible in his uh pocket and he showed the scripture to me about Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 13. and we Catholic we don't believe in reading a Bible because if we see a person reading a Bible we call them crazy so this guy was showing the Bible to me and if you don't have money in your pocket you will listen and so I was listening to him he said hear ye the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man for God will bring every secret thing into judgment whether it be good or evil and when I heard that something struck in my heart I thought that the whole matter the the conclusion of the whole matter here is to just to enjoy your life you know eat drink and enjoy your life the more you die I believe before in reincarnation but because of this message because of the Bible I want to go with him I want to stay with him and I I told him can I go to your house maybe I can I can fellowship with you and he said let's go so he stopped driving the bicycle and I was staying there I was eating and he was like telling to his wife he said um uh uh he I forgot the name of the wine so he said if the Rapture will take place tonight Warren doesn't have a house to stay can we give the house to him and I was like where are you going not sure he said Rapture is a if you're faithful God will will uh bring you to the Rapture without seeing that I said I love that give me more tell me more about it and after that brother after a week I said I will surrender I will get baptized and I got baptized but then in my heart remember the the John chapter 1 I got baptized and I was so happy I felt like something that the the happiness that that I cannot explain in my heart the father that I was longing because my my father left us when I was eight years old but then something here in my heart that I was so happy I cannot explain I need to share this to my family I need to share this to the people Wherever I Go but then I was here uh holding the Bible I don't care about the the my friends to tell me anymore about I'm crazy because the joy it's unspeakable joy in my heart so then what happened was I shared the Bible to the person and he challenged me he said I did you share this to your family I said no I just accepted the the Lord last week I don't even I was sharing the Bible I don't even know what this version chapter but then here was the the challenge of this man he said you chair to your family first and then if they will accept then come back to me was a challenge he said because you know the fire that you're you're you're in your heart right now is just like a hay fire you know the fire the the hey you you sparked the the hay and then it will fire so fast and uh gone so he was telling me that maybe next week you will go back to the world but that was the challenge so what I did I went to my brothers so I uh the map again brother so three of my bro two of my brothers live here also we were working because we were farmer here farmers and I don't want to to I don't want mud anymore so I went here and I was working as a Salesman and then I flew back here and shared to my brothers two brothers they know my weakness I said let's go to the movie no I said let's let's watch uh let's let's uh listen to the the Bible I said no let's go to the movie let's go to the movie first so I went to the movie with them we were watching movie and at the same time I was telling them about the the Bible and they said quiet after the after the movie will go to go home and uh but I was I was so persistent I was because I was convinced that this is true and what happened was I shared this message to my brothers and then they found out after uh after um um maybe a week my other brother accepted the message because I keep going there to to their apartments and keep telling the the scripture do you know brother there's the other one my older brother he cannot accept the message and I was the one like pushings but then at the same time my other brother was uh uh was with me now he said he's accepting the message and then Brothers after a month I said the map again I said I found him I found the Messiah here can we leave our job and let's go back here and live for Christ can we come together here and live for Christ and this they decided and went with me now not only my two brothers accepted the message my mom accepted the message and my sister accepted the message because of the challenge of that man brother uh can you show then something something deep inside in me there's something more that not only to my brothers and sisters I need to share this uh this message to the people that's what what that's what happened to you brother if you're convinced of this message don't stay home share this wherever you go even to your work even to your boss even to go to Walmart Brothers share this message now that was me I started up I think the the first one because this is the second Church I became a taxi driver in the Philippines uh in Iloilo when I uh went back because there was no job I think that uh yes that's the one so this is the first uh I started uh I started a house meeting uh in Iloilo if you can go back to the map again I will show this where's the church so the church is in this side close to the ocean I started the church over there and the second Church I started here so from north to south so that that first church show it again brother the the church so that's that church my brother when I left the house meeting because God is calling me to start another church my brother took over the church because he married the sister from that house meeting so that church 2010 it looked like a brother Marx uh tool shop but uh uh now 2022 that's the the front end time message pure word Tabernacle the second the Believers now 2022 no that's the the big uh group of believers that's the second Church that's the 2022 believers because I was convinced to share this message brother look at the fruits that was the anniversary meeting I will be there Lord willing on the July 10th because the anniversary meeting will be in July 10th because I was convinced to share the word of God we started in a small group don't be discouraged if it's too simple if it's too little one day the second Church um again I will hold all my I will hold on my tears the the first church that I started um this is his ministry if I say I forgive me but this is a different vessel this is the the mass that right now it's in the fivefold ministry it's his ministry we're just a vessel we're just a microphone the the other Church the one with the kids the second Church I I go to I every um Monday I go back to the city and drive a taxi and save money me and Maria was helping each other just to build this church and then I started to the kids I was a young man with hair and the kids likes me because I like a story about the you know the I started the story about the Bible so the kids likes me and those kids right now are married people and they have kids already so this was 19 uh 2004. that was the church this uh next brother that's the church right now this is my older brother and because of I was convinced of this message now I will tell you it's not easy to start a church to start a church when I started here as I said I was a toxic driver I I told to the people I said I will feed you spiritual but after that God put a desire in my heart to feed you physical also before you go home I want we will eat together and I want that's my hardest desire I don't care what kind of food but we will eat together and I opened the Opera offering box I found one peso in the offering box for years I suffered to to work hard bring a little of money just to feed the people that's the heart of a minister we don't care about the money we don't care because God Will Supply our needs my favorite scripture you know what seek you the kingdom of God and this righteousness and all these things will be added unto you I always say it's all it's you this is your promise that's the the fruits right now and one soul is equivalent of ten thousand worlds how many of you have a desire from now on I will share your word that's why I ask you brother Amos last Sunday how many Souls did you bring to Christ because it's not ours but one soul brother the the angels from Heaven going back and forth enjoying that there's a there's a a soul that accepted to him amen um the last one that's me that's my mom my my dad left us when I was eight that's my older brother that's the pastor in the other church and that's my sister thank you I will preach now amen that's the ministry it's his now the world is a mess you know the the problem of this world it's not bloody Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping you know the economy is going down and down but not because of the Russian war because of the Ukraine war the problem of this world are not the overloaded prison or the or or the sputniks over there in downtown Phoenix the problem of this world is sin and the president of the United States cannot fix it NATO cannot fix it it's the problem of this world is sin and the message in the of this hour is bring us is to bring us back when we accepted the message of the Malachi 4 the great and Dreadful day and this is the the hour at the time that the great and Dreadful day is coming soon but before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord God will send Elijah the prophet to who to you and I to you and me brother the prophet said here brother what the word needs today is not a new mayor I I did not uh put that I forgot not a new prayer an old Saint Paul [Music] preach back in his church in its power we don't need any governor or any president we're thinking maybe uh this uh brother from or this man from a a young charismatic from Florida will change the United States never because we are heading into a wrong direction this is the last days we don't have hope anymore our hope is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah oh brother he said here the message convince and then concerned he said and I believe that every man Every Woman every boy or girl that ever stayed long enough that you're convinced that it is right and it is the Holy Ghost you will burden so hard in your heart that you can stand still and let these people die like this is shame and sin it's true I cannot stay I told Brother James labo last week he said I I said do you know what happened last month when I went to uh to Rio Grande I said the Pastor from from Rio Grande asked me because I was telling him about the mission and he said you go every month to this country that country you must drive uh you're you're driving maybe uh Maserati I said brother without if I'm not going to the mission field I can buy Tesla X but because of this message we don't care anymore as long as we can share this message to the people and I believe God will will give us a reward one day not the reward of this world but the reward over there oh one day how pure and how Glory how how precious it is if the people that that was you won in the Lord will bring you as a crown that's a joy Brethren Amos our suffering here is temporal oh it will grind the very heart of you to get out here on the streets it does any Christian to see the people wholly given over to sin drinking gambling cursing swearing smoking every car that you pull up behind is a woman with a cigarette oh in their fingers with one of this water head haircuts he didn't put here with a blue colored hair there was a one a man from gadara you know a man from gadara the by uh the message here uh greater than Solomon is here he said you come all the way from Heaven to hear the Cry of one blind beggar you come all the way from heaven one time to answer across the uh or cross the oceans to one man that was insane the maniac of gadara he heard the Cry of the maniac from gadara and from Heaven brother he came down he didn't really care about the situation he didn't really care if the 10 000 demons will destroy him crossing the Lakes but because of the cries of the man from gadara he answered it and he came down from heaven and you know what happened he said and healed that man and returned to your home it seems like away from your topic brother Warren I thought you're talking about the about the convince and then concern well wait a minute he said he was he was lying back in the back uh in the back of the boat rocking around and the Bible said that the storm came down upon the sea and began to toss the boat the disciples said carries thou not for we perish he said oh where's your faith look around and the great winds and waves obeyed him what was he doing Crossing rough sea that night because one soul in gadara was ready to receive him one soul in gadara he would come from glory for one soul that was ready to receive him and remember this man that was ready to receive and was a sick man he was a mentally sick he was a maniac he'd lost his mind the doctor could not do nothing for him he was out into the caves and the graveyards that's the place the devil will take you will put you in the graveyard but remember when Jesus met him he was he was in chain and with the feathers in his ankles but then he always break the chains because the the demon Tower Brothers ten thousand demons can break the chain how much more the power of the Holy Ghost can't break every chain tonight brother when Jesus met him he broke the chain the chain of craziness and he was in the right mind but then all the legions wants to you know the business of that that the country was a Hormel uh sausage um bacons and everything but then because of that swine that the demons went to the swine and two thousand swines went to the cliff they lost their stocks that time Hormel went down but then the people doesn't like him but here was the man from gadara they pushed Jesus to go back to Galilee but here was the man from gadara in his right mind with the clothes Van Heusen brother one with the clothes and then they ask they ask him why this man has a clothes because he met Jesus but then he was concerned so he went with Jesus Jesus I want to be your disciple can I go with you and Jesus said in Mark chapter 5 brother 18. to 20. and when he was come into the ship he had been possessed with the devil prayed him that night to be with him how be it Jesus suffered him not but said unto him go home to thy friends and to tell them how great things the Lord had done oh boy and had compassion on thee and he departed and began to publish to preach in decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did Marvel what is decapolis dika in Greek is ten police is cities 10 big cities in the capitalists but he so he preached to that big cities brother and then cities the people there were marveled because he was convinced that Jesus healed him and Jesus is the Lord and then brother he became a preacher Hallelujah are you convinced tonight then share it to your children share it to your loved ones oh we are the mouthpiece of God we are the air peace of God and we are the I and so forth and so uh on the earth and uh and and so forth of the Earth this is from the deep call it to the Deep we are the eyes the mouthpiece and the earpiece of God brother who will if you don't brother I tell you the stone will preach to other people Ezekiel chapter 3. listen to this moreover of the four brother moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou finest eat the roll and go speak to the house of Israel so I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat the roll the book son of man eat the book a son of man introducing this son of man in the last days oh and I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat the roll and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this role that I give thee then did I eat it and it was in my my mouth as honey as sweetness or sweetness and then he said unto me son of man go to the house of Israel and speak with my uh my words to them he was commissioned because you cannot go without eating the message remember the prophet said one day there in the last day people are running to and pro looking for food but in the message we have plenty of food because the message stored at the food in the last days oh brother that's why I have I have a fat belly because I keep eating the food spiritual food amen and Revelation chapter 8 or 10 8 or 10 11 I will go straight to the 11th brother and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples a nation and tongues and kings after you eat the book prophesy and I'm prophesying wherever we go brother we're prophesying here's the message in Ezekiel chapter 37 1. and the Hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones I was a bone one time we were both one time and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo we were very dry or they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can this bone live is that the answer tonight can this bone lives and he said oh God thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and he's saying to them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus set the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause bread unto them or unto you and ye shall leave and I will lay sinu upon you and I will bring up flesh upon you and covered with skin and put breadth or breathe in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied and say commanded as I prophesied there was a noise under and behold it was a shaking and the bones came together bones bone in his bone brother we experience the Pentecostal experience it was uh the the noise was so bad but then after the third book came it was silent no one knows it flesh Sino coming in skin coming in we're done of this Pentecostal age I don't care brother if the preachers in this message still bringing the Pentecostal belief but to me this is the time of the third fall oh when I be healed no does he know and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but here was no breathing them that's it to me prophesy into the wind prophesy son of man and I say unto the wind thus said the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath that bread or bread that breathes upon this slain that they may live so I prophesied I said I say he commanded me and the bread came into them and they live and stood up on their feet and exceeding great Army when I accepted the message I be I became part of the army come on go forward this is the time to break this message to all over the world beginning from Jerusalem to Phoenix to wherever we go to the uttermost part of the world amen oh brother can you can let brother Branham preach for a while listening the father could hit it from the educated and shrudent wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would come to Calvary now watch Jesus said watch how he stated it the works that I do he's doing him right now The Works that I'm doing now Healing The Sick racing it in Open the Eyes of the blind these Works shall you do also you'll do these if you believe in me you do these words and then a greater than this shall you do before I go to my father a little while in the world won't see me no more yet you'll see me I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world I will not leave you comfortless I'll pray the father he'll send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the world cannot receive yet you can receive him now notice the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick but prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart Eternal lives to believers the Holy Ghost was coming and give it into the hands of the church to impart lives thank you that's what Cal remembers yeah it does do degraded men and women and lifted him into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick Anthony Park eternal life given the Holy Ghost to obedient believers man who were once the unbelievers be made Believers and imparted spiritual eternal life how much greater is it to say the sick woman in here I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then said greater than this should you do yes I'm gonna give you power it's not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life but you'll be Eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing could ever happen was to impart Eternal lives to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a Son of God Can Jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sin you retain to them they are retained that's right now yours were the Catholic church and many others made their big mistake they want to offer give your sins that wasn't it how did they get sins forgiven in the Bible Peter answered that question on the day of Pentecost they said what what can we do to be saved you get this that you all got he laid down the prescription yes he did he told him what to do he said repent every one of you towards God and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the remission of your sins [Music] how many you preachers this morning how many of you listen to my word on magnetic tape however this morning look what God did there for you thank you amen and forsake your denominational Creed and preach the gospel [Music] [Applause] why repentance and remission of sins must be preached in his name do all the world beginning at Jerusalem [Applause] what does Calvary mean to you what'd that day do to you do stuff you out with some theology did it make you a stuffed shirt Christians sold out Hallelujah Raider Works in this shall you do you see who the yees are don't you know Greater Works than this remitting sins in the name of Jesus Christ amen now my question can this bone lives thou knowest we can impart eternal life when you when I heard that brother oh there was an a Pentecostal experience in the house now the prophet here he said in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ he said he that believeth in me Saint John chapter 4 14 7 he that believeth in me the works that I do you shall do also or the same works and greater than this because Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh would be greater he could not bring it to them because the Holy Ghost hadn't yet been given but when Jesus came and Sanctified his life and the Holy Ghost returned then they could impart eternal life to the people Brothers we can Empower impart light to the peoples not only praying for the sick but to impart life make them an army Hallelujah the sign and wonders Jesus plainly said in Mark 16 going into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature how far all the world how many every creatures long as the gospel is being preached this sign shall follow to them that believe can you see can you see what I I saw the sign will follow you you don't beg for a sign because when you you accepted the commission of the Lord the sign is following us okay Glory my the prophet said here would the bride the question would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the rapture sure that's what's going on right now see the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of Christ sure she is consists with apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great ministry but they're unknown because they're not popping up or brother Stephen was telling uh uh how do you say it brother Stephen it was a prideful it's a very great ministry Ministry of the hour but it's so humble I like that we're unknown but yet well known the prophet said here notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until sin the father or the father shown him first the harmony between God and Christ John 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her his Word of Life he shows her and she receives it now look at this God and Jesus now it's Jesus and us the bride of Christ she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for it it is the uh the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then I got a great big Hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride don't wait for the Baptist to go to the Philippines or to go to to Cambodia or to Africa the mouthpiece of God is not the Baptist the mouthpiece of God is the message of the hour and it's in flesh with the Believers they do only his will not our will simple humble but but I believe that no one can persuade them different they have that set the Lord or they keep still then they will do greater or do the works of God for it is himself the continuing the word to fulfill he said he did complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here Gloria David for it is was not yet Brothers we are the continuation the book of Acts what the book of Acts knew they forsook everything for the cause of Christ amen oh my we are the Bible said the message said look deity a part of Charles Branham because I was born from Charles Branham my Daddy I'm a part of him I've got the forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like him very included brother with God but you deity in man did I I jump oh here I jump yes and if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwells in the man Hallelujah when you talk about blind eyes being opened they said nothing is impossible to God God said nothing is impossible with you speak the word there's nothing impossible with us straight to the dry bones oh and said then they said nothing impossible with uh to God that there's nothing impossible with you if you believe not with God but you deity it is in man the very God that took back here on the mystical platform of the eternities and ruled worlds of it on his hands of his hands and created these things gave to you privileged to be his son and you're a part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity Hallelujah there you are I might choke you but study over that a little while see this is 1951. he is God dwell in man and man becomes a Son of God not him in himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I think of that then I stand with unwavering faith and ask what you will it shall be done unto you there he is God there he is a resurrection of Lazarus 1951. tonight if we are the people speak the word to the dry bones oh thou knowest Hallelujah not only bringing bones uh let the the skeleton walk like this no brothers put us a new a flesh and a skin Hallelujah one day there was a a a tree children of Israel they came when they were young from Israel to Babylon their name is or I forgot the name but but the Babylonian gave them a names about their gods they called them sadrach Meshach and Abednego in in the uh Daniel chapter 7 for I think uh 14 I will check Daniel chapter no Daniel Daniel chapter 3. I think I'm a I'm drunk here tonight you know the story they don't want to bow down to the image they know who Daniel is that's their brother why you want me to bow down to the image of Daniel but here's the here's the people they want him to to put in the fiery furnace because of their belief that there's only one God and that is the god of of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and Warren and William Branham and all of us that's our God will nothing about down to the image but then here's the people they want to put him into the into the fiery furnace but here's the the they were convinced that even though we are here in captivity the task Masters was whipping us every day but one day I believe that God will release us from captivity because it's almost time it's 68 years they were reading their scroll 68 years two years left but then here they put them to to to fiery furnace remember the prophet said there was no music over there young people there was no Fellowship over there they stood by themselves can you believe you're by yourself in the midst of Philadelphia people over there putting uh drugs in their hands but you're there standing with your faith they were convinced that there's only one God the god of Abraham Isaac Joseph but here in 17 3 17. this is the statement of the three Hebrew children's if it's bestow Our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not but if not be it known unto thee O King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up it changed my topic brother they were convinced that the God will deliver them but here Far Far Away From Heaven stood Michael and wormwood let me call they were standing by you let me go and God said you're faithful to be wormwood to me blooded one time the the world in time of dawah I cannot let you go here's Gabriel ready to fight ready to fight let me let me go and I will destroy them all but he said no Gabriel you will go to Mary next time not to them right now and they said but who will go oh Lord and he stepped down promise from his throne [Applause] I will go in there I will go with them because they were convinced that the god that they serve is not only with one true God now it's my time they're convinced now I am uh concerned of them see Brothers do you think it's you walking it's you talking it's you working it's not it's him I am convinced but then God said I am concerned with you also Gloria now he came I like the story of the Prophet listen if you feel sad sometimes go listen to the story of the prophet he's a historian he read the whole truckload of Encyclopedia a seventh grade but then he came and then he was the the feathers and the the chain walking inside the furnace but when they went they entered in the soldiers that brought them all died but three of them was walking oh let me walk with you he they were singing but then here comes the son of God and then the the the the the the the uh Nebuchadnezzar said give me my glasses something's wrong how many did you put they said uh did we put three he said no I saw four and the other one looked
