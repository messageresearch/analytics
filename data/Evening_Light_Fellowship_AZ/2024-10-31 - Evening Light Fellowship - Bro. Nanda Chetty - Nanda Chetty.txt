name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you you may be seated you'll have to bear with me I Don't Preach in English at my place I preach in French before I'm like trying in my mind to translate the words from French to English and then but I believe that my accent is good enough for you to understand what I'm saying amen before I begin with the word I don't want to be long I know I know it's a Wednesday service and since I've got one service with you I would like just to share a few thoughts that might be a blessing to you that's how we want at the end of the day to be a blessing to you and uh I would sing a song that I think I sang that song the last time to express my testimony how I was healed of asthma I was dying with asthma at the age of 16 and God healed me for the first time I went to a Christian meeting I never knew the Bible I've never read that book before I was a Tamil a Hindu by religion I was worshiping gods and I came across the Bible at the age of 16 and God healed me from asthma chronic asthma condition and that's where that song was a blessing to me I I teach you a it's only little verse but it's going to be good I believe that God will help us tonight for I seeing that song said the words are very simple he is an answering God when I prayed in Jesus name and said then by faith the answer came if I can yeah if I can get the guitar fine just yeah I sing I'm sure you are ready for the word and I'm very happy you know what I'm not saying it because he's in front of me uh he has been a mentor to me over the years I'm telling you honestly when I came to the message I was very confused I was under the leadership of a man you know leadership of men brings fear and I I had a very I wanted to commit suicide I had schizophrenia I went to my psychiatrist I told him I'm going to kill myself it was I was taking anti-depressant tablets I was having strange feelings and like electric nerves going through my body I would rush to the toilet I would scream oh open the door of my car and throw myself on the road wanted to kill myself because I was fighting this message for I'm telling that to those who are new who never knew me I fought the message of the hour for 9 years very harsh I pulled people out of the message because the message was a threat to me I thought it was of the devil I even translated a missionary from America from Baytown Texas he was my missionary I was a UPC ordained minister those days and he would be saying brother Bram is a devil and I would translate in French what he saying and my church will be very happy they will all run around was crying hollering brother Bram is a devil brother Bram is a false prophet because I couldn't I couldn't figure out how the supper had an affair with Eve the serpent seed was something very difficult for me to to swallow can you understand what I'm saying I fought the message for 9 years and then God had a way to teach me thank you Lord I felt sick very bad I couldn't I couldn't even look at my wife hear my wife speak to me I couldn't hear my children scream around playing around I would take pillows and try to put around my ears and that's how bad it was then I came from a long trip a Non-Stop trip from home Hong Kong it was the 2nd March of 1993 was the Tuesday after 10 hours nonstop I reach home very early in the morning and uh I began to give gifts to my wife my children at night at 10:30 I remember I was crying I was under that attack again depressive you know then I said to my wife I'm going back to church she told me church after 5 years you have been backsliding you didn't know where you going going that night which church are you going to I said Message Church am amen and on the 7th March it was a Sunday I found myself in a message church thank you Lord till today amen thank you Jesus I I never had any regret of me being in the in the message church and uh and then uh what happened maybe a couple of years I was under a Ministry I wanted who he was I was really burdened I I went to church and I was shocked by the way the pastor was expressing himself the way he was teaching the people he believed at one time he he was the prophet in the Rapture would be taking place here right in this building you know and then all and I was really really shocked and I needed someone to guide me that's why I'm telling you now I'm being very honest brother Ron has been a man of God that really helped me a lot maybe he never realized it you know I happened to had a VHS some VHS uh preachings that he did in in Switzerland for the young people and he preached about three or four services with brother Daniel Williams and uh I listen to those tips over and over and over that's what I then I got his phone number from Brother francea i f him and he came over to my Island in 1997 for the first time thank you Lord and I don't know you people you are blessed to be sitting by this that that man of here know because every time I've been with him even now he would always be saying things I would be listening carefully I I even remember told him what I remembered he told me those years struck in my mind and it helped me a lot along the way and uh that's why I'm very grateful to him God bless him richly him more years when he saw me I was with my cap he said how are you young man I said not not young anymore and lifted my cap you know I'm like him B like [Laughter] him oh my praise the Lord okay let's because I know it's only one service let's let's be friendly tonight let's be together tonight we'll just talk brother Mario how are you oh my Mario to that's my good friend and sister Joseph still laughing that's very that's very good I still remember I smiling all the time thank you for the gift God bless you Sister Daisy God bless you also and let me sing that song because I I you know as Minister you talk and we going to talk you know sing that song thank you Pastor Ron for the confidence and for everything you've done for me that song is very very simple words I was see in French for the French people here and then in English say that he's an answering God when I prayed in Jesus name then by faith the answer came Hallelujah he's an answer ring God hallelujah is an answering go when I pray in Jesus name then by faith the answer came Hallelujah he's an answering God that's all the words of the song very easy to learn Hallelujah is an answering God hallelujah he's an answering God when I pray in Jesus name then by faith the answer came Hallelujah he's an answering God [Music] hallelujah hallelu [Music] [Music] [Applause] hallelu amen God bless you wish stand now and as we read the Bible I'm going to read a scripture and uh we'll see how the Lord leads the title of my message tonight is hindrances we read in the book of Acts you know I've learned something when I was working at the insurance company he said when you write our letter I will be teaching how to write letters there I tell them when you write don't write to impress that's right to express amen very good that's how we want to preach our we don't want to impress anyone that's we want to be a blessing to you amen I don't believe that God has let us travel that long distance 25 hour to come here from our Island 12 hours nonstop from Rous to char gold Paris and from Paris to where we came to Denver it was 10 hours and then we came here I think 2 hours flight and we are not here to impress anyone if we can be of any blessing to you that's what we want you've traveled so far you've done such a sacrifice you want a blessing from God therefore as you decide to pull from the minister God will bless you amen we'll just read the the scripture 8 acts 8 verse 36 and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the unic said see he is water what does hinder me to be baptized amen let me repeat again he said here is the water what does hinder me to be baptized then I I'll read Galatians chapter 5 5 and verse 7 Galatians chapter 5 verse 7 Hallelujah yeah if you have found it we're going to read those who are looking for Galatians in the Old Testament 57 you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth amen you seen the word hinder in those two scriptures that we read the Lord bless the reading of the word you may be seated well before I get into my sermon I I I like where I go for the first time I like to introduce something to you very quick that would be like you know when when those football players they get on the ground they had a war ing up first you know we have to warm ourselves before there's a scripture that we as Pentecostal we I I we we used to like when I was there in 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 it would say this for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power the moment we heard power we all shout as Pentecostal you know but I want you to read the verse carefully he said but of power and of love and of a sound mind then verse eight he said be not thou therefore I was taught by my missionary a long time ago he said when you see that word therefore you should stop and see why is therefore amen that's right that word therefore is is linked with what he said before we have received a spirit of power of love and of a sound mind therefore because we have received that therefore be not ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord but there's a comma where there's a comma the the the the sentence continues amen know of me yeah therefore we should not be ashamed to give testimony of of the Lord amen because people would say you just talk about brother Bram every time amen every time you talk you say brother Bram said this brother Brown said it is that this Christ has been put aside but Paul said he's saying here amen you've received the spirit of power of a sound mind of Love Therefore yes be not ashamed to talk about the about about the Lord yes come neither of me right not that Paul is trying to align me himself with Jesus Christ but he's saying I'm a prisoner of Christ I I I am the one who's preed who preaching the word for the hour don't be ashamed to talk about Christ but also talk about me because he not my word I'm going to preach his word because I'm just Chang we are ashamed to talk about the prophet today yes we try to come around like you know in a way diplomatically you know but I'm not ashamed you cannot talk about the Ark of Noah without mentioning Noah how you do that can anybody relate to me the story of Noah and don't say about Noah can anybody talk to me about The Exodus and not mention Moses can you are talking about the building of the biggest temple in the world the Temple of Solomon and then you don't want to say you talk about the the lies then the fiery f is don't mention about Daniel don't mention about shadra no you can't do that and I can't talk about the message of the hour the greatest message that ever hit the earth you got mention with brother don't be ashamed you got the spirit of power of sound man of love but therefore don't be ashamed to justify about Christ neither of me people neither of me brother Bram talk about me there's no problem just I'm not I'm not began yet started yet he said be not be not thou therefore asham is it okay my English can I get to you okay of the testimony of Our Lord know of of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God I read you you a quote that that quote helped me to understand that scripture amen if the brother can get it to for me very easy 9th June 53 9th June 53 make the valley full of ditches paragraph three that quote really en enlightened my mind about not to be ashamed of of the Prophet that's was H me over the years my church has been growing over the years because I am not ashamed of that Prophet i' I've gone to Madagascar for over 28 years established churches there preaching a great Revival is happening even on R Island even in Ran Island because we're not ashamed because that message saved my life how can I be ashamed of testifying of something that really blessed my life a lady look at I want you to follow me slowly a lady in my church paragraph three and make the valley full of ditches evening 9th June 53 evening okay his brother can look for it but I'm going to read a lady in mat brother Bill and Mrs we she was dying with TV she was in the sanatorium at the last stages I like those words he was dying at the last stages let me tell you for God God for God there's no last stage because he's got the final St you believe that God has the final I don't care what kind of a disease you're going through whether it's cancer whether a dreadful disease or a dreadful situation God remember this God has the final amen man can say you are your final stage but look listen to what man has to say listen to what God has to say they sent her the sister home to die look at how it was for them they were sending her home that is there is no more home the the the ultimate thing will be she will die that's what men is thinking about the doctors said there's nothing could be done for her say Mrs Grace Weber in Jefferson she lived just beyond the Tabernacle and she had got five or six little children so now listen carefully so the angel of the Lord come to me that night yes and said go tell Mrs Weber and tell Mr Weber rather to get things ready for he's going to be left with those children on his hands for his wives is going now it's the angel of the Lord which is God himself that's the way in the Old Testament God would be the angel of God now is talking he said go tell Mr re the husband her wife's going to die his wife going to die now get ready he said well I went and told but brother listen to the angel of God he said well I went and told Mr wber I told his little girl little Jean Rose which is a nurse now she was a little bitty fellow then she's a young lady now it's been 7 years ago Mo I said now Genie your mother is going to die she can't live but a little while longer and two days after that or 3 days there was some ladies from the government Depot Depot Depot there where she worked before her colleagues from work is coming home to visit her she's at the last stage is coming and Mrs Weber said if I could only how brother be to pray for me once more she's dying am and she just SS the prayer of Samson once more which means there's always a possibility I don't care how your case has been diagnosed how far you've gone but there's there's a once more for you there's a possibility for you do you believe that amen if I could only have brother Bill to pray for me once more now he's she on the deathbed amen she's testifying to her colleagues at word amen about the power of prayer about brother Bram who had prayed for someone said to pray for me once more she said I I seen when my co cousin opal was healed with that cancer therefore she had a testimony if we had a previous testimony previous testimony we can base ourselves on it if if things like that have have been happening before your face should rise to a level said God if somebody has been healed of cancer if someone has had such a difficulty if someone has had a son or a boy or or or a daughter who has left home and she's come back my daughter my son I don't know Lord but you you you will be able to bring him back because I've seen someone I've heard about a testimony before I've seen when my cousin Opel was healed with that cancer and the doctor just gave her till morning to live and her daughter's a nurse also said the girls from out at the government where she worked with her said look how the girls reacted to the words to the testimony of the sister said if I only you can get brother Bram to come and pray for me once more I'm going to be healed she's confessing she's testifying about the prophet's prayer and the girl said now there ate nothing to that guy look now look how the reaction the response was there ate nothing to that guy said he's he's nothing but a hypocrite that's all religion is just a bunch of faith fanaticism and so M said look I'm dying maybe she was sleeping like that in this in this in a position that she can't lift herself up but she said I'm look I'm dying but I just won't stand still for that what you're saying about my Prophet what you're testifying about my Prophet even if I'm dying I'm not going to be ashamed of the testimony to give to my prophet he said I know but I just wanton stand still for that she said I know better than that what you saying about my Prophet but me I know better than that and we know better than that what they are putting on YouTube what they're trying to say about his messages I don't have time to go and about this but we know better than that no negative testimony will affect our walk with God we're going to continue to walk with the message of the hour and with God you believe that she said I I know I know I have that like job would say I know my redeemer it's not somebody else knows it's my own personal experience I know am do you know I know better than that she said I live right here around this around that man all the time I seen him from a child grown up and I can't tell you excuse me I can't tell you you've seen him also as a child yes when you listen to the to my life story while listening to my life story you've seen brother Bram like from a child the way he has been raised up he said I've seen him from a child said I know he said you can call it fake if you want to he said said that I've seen it so much and seen God heal the people she said I know the man's life what people are saying about brother Bram nobody can say anything about his life that's something great to have a true as a Christian to live the life worthy of the Gospel I know the man's life and I know it's the truth now paragraphs five said and it happened to be because she's testifying now don't be ashamed because you have been given the spirit of Power of Love of a sound mind therefore be not ashamed let not testify of Jesus Christ but of me also now because she had been testified of the prophet and it happened to be that the angel of the Lord heard that oh my and that that very night sitting on the side of my chair in the room after I got up and went and got a drink of water about 3:00 in the morning and sitting on the chair I seen him come walking through the door it was Jesus Christ coming walking through the door I see do you believe the message of the hour I see him come walking through the door he said tomorrow Sunday that they are going to pick up Miss rubber up and bring her down she'll be sitting on the right hand side far back in the Tabernacle said said tell her tell her I heard her what she said and not ashamed to testify of the Prophet tell her I heard her what she said and tell her thus sayth the Lord she will live and not die Hallelujah the God God Chang the verdict The God Who would never change his mind about his word change his mind because a woman Was Not Afraid ashamed to testify of a prophet don't be ashamed to testify of Willam of the message she will live God change the ver God change what the doctor said I'm telling you tonight not that I I am to like that but I'm telling you the same thing that happened to you confess the word of God not be ashamed of the message of the hour I don't care what the doctor has said about you I don't care what the lawyer has said about you I don't care what the government officer has said God can change the you believe that you can't change that because you are not afraid that asham you testify of the word of God there you are so you can go down and see her if you'd like to about 7 years ago all right see his presence was there wow when she was taking up for what was right wow because she was testifying she was not afraid not asham she was taking a stand for the message for the prophet said tell his presence amen I believe tonight that he's here he's here because we are not ashamed to testify the same thing that happened there is happening here right now he said his presence was there when she was taking her from what for what was right see his presence was there and he found her abely so he come and told me what she had said what she said to these women and he God he had respect to her because she had respect unto what was representing God was not God but he was representing God and that woman that sister understood that brother wasn't an ordering man but he was representing God that very moment and because she had respect to what was representing God the angel came down and CH tell her now she's not going to die she's going to live what a powerful message yes yes sure God will do the same thing for you put you in there am begin to testify show no shame when you talk of the prophet and God will send his Angel around and whatever you have been asking for expect and believe God it God will do the same thing for you not to to respect to me but to respect to him to Christ the one who died for your healing it will just give respects to him and his word God will do the work for you am amen God bless you I want us to give that as a little start to appetite before we enter that word the word of the hour oh my you love the word I don't know of anything that can fo our situation our pain the word of God has got healing power amen we've seen so many things if we would take time and give testimony of the great works of God that you know you you have the same thing here around here okay let [Music] me read those scripture it was I know I now that I'm preaching I know I won't I won't end the message your pastor told me to come again we see we'll try something he told me when I come you must preach Friday Saturday and Sunday yes that's it was the the story the thing that helped me a lot along my way in the message of the hour because I was criticizing the prophet the message saying all kinds of bad things the Lord opened my eyes and let me saw even brother Bram in the scripture I don't have time this time but I saw the prophet's life in many scriptures many stories in the Bible That's why that expression which I like to preach all over where I go he said when those angels paragraph 43 the Feast of the trumpets preach 9th of July 64 19th July 64 he said when those angels met me and opened those Seven Seas the Bible has become a new Bible the problems today is that we are going we are still reading the Bible with the eyes of the theologians with the eyes of the teaching that we had before even in Pentecost we have to just let go of everything of the now we are reading from a new Bible we want to read from the new Bible the Bible had become become a new Bible therefore that that story here it was uh the unic he always stressed on Phillip I was asking myself why brother bam would take Phillip when he talks about Phillip was having a great Revival there in Samaria therefore he was having a great Revival there was the lame was walking the demons who were been cast out he a big healing comping he said God will remove him from there from that Big Revival to bring him to a one one man to men one single soul and an angel will be taking him away it was the the angel the and his commission unto me an angel was sent to Commission philli he will take him away from a Big Revival of numbers healing Revival and everything to bring him to his soul to one that's the message of the hour no more the first and second P like the 10 vision is a onetoone affair God is dealing with one to one therefore when I was looking at that I was seeing even the the prophet that's why he was always talking about that man because it was his ministry yeah he said that in the body at that moment I'm talking about among the mixed C in the body at that moment there was only one man who had seed it was Philip because he had seed he could go and put seed in the unic that's right because the unic had no seed of himself God now changed his ministry from a big campaign Revival sending him in the third po to an individual Affair amen amen he sent it to one man and he was having a great Revival at such a point that there was a man he was a sorcerer Simon yeah when he saw the gift of speaking tongue the baptism of the Holy Ghost he wanted that gift he wanted to pay because he was rich he was rich that was L this year right going after the gifts looking for the gift and he had money to pay for that yeah but he was a sorcery in the vision of the Bride brother said now that I noticed there were naked that is Le DEA right said have you noticed that church was guided was led by was a witch that was Leia with Simon the Sorcerer Pentecostal AG I'm sorry I'm being BL to you Pentecostalism has even begin to sleep in the message of the I've been there for a long time I know that movement yes it's so close that he can deceive the very El therefore therefore God now took that the angel took philli brought him down to the unit said he he he was coming from a from the from Pentecost he was coming from from a bunch of doctors but there then but then even he came from them a bunch of doctors in the world he was confused because when he was reading the Bible the Bible was still the old Bible he came from the School of Theology he couldn't understand what he was reading that's why God now displaced himself from the great Revival because the ministry is changing for for Phillip it's no more the crowd God is sending him for the commissioning of an Angel to one to one to Open the Eyes of the man could understand the scripture now he's reading from a new book lord he takes the book while he's reading Philip now the French word is nice sorry brother the French word is very said apost come near The Chariot the word por it in French is like Kinsman God had to send us a Kinsman at the end time somebody that would come near to us to be able to redeem us the Redemption comes through a kinsman's redem God has to send that man who was far away in big campaigns he brought him near to The Chariot said come near there right then he asked them man do you understand what you're reading say how can I unless a guide he was confessing now that he needs a guide and God sent us a guide in this generation that's why they they title a guide because we could never understand scriptures unless God sent that guy brother Bram I'm saying it right brother Bram was a guy that God sent to us for us to understand the scripture prise the Lord now we are reading from a new book new interpretation of the Bible you know got many kind of translations of the Bible you I don't know uh new internal version King James version It's called version but the best translation is the new Bible from the message of the [Applause] hour the voice said can you and that's somebody now what you was reading he was reading Isaiah 53 which is the I'm sorry my watch is very funny he saying you're falling or you having a heart attack I I have to remove the devil can talk for your for your wife have some negative thoughts you what I she was reading not understanding the scripture that was our problem we was reading confused with all kinds of translation with all kinds of interpretation God has to set us a guide in this generation in the person of brother William Bram and then he said no that he was reading what he was reading the first part of redemption which was the crucifixion you know John was in with Mary in front of the Cross he saw the blood dripping up from the cross he saw the blood coming from the from the from the head of Jesus Christ when when they put the th and and and the side he was be he saw the blood as Pentecost I remember very well we disclaim the blood everywhere we go we go when we reach home we put our hands on the door the blood of Jesus Christ the blood the blood the blood the blood we just repeat the blood if time that's not the blood what happened he was reading the first part of redemption and John saw but yet when he came when he went uh after the cing of time past time he was he was weeping because because the book was still closed he knew even if the blood was was was was poured out there that was the first part of redemption yes that was the paying of the price but the claiming B was to come after why he was he was weeping so that's what if Philip was being used for the past first part of redemption God said un the guide in this end time Amen to open our eyes concerning the second part which is the claiming part God has come to claim us back he said we were sealed in that book paragra I think 75 the breach we were seal in there but when the book was open then we came out we were lose from hallelujah amen the what hinder you when the Philip should have introduced to him the Plan of Salvation because then why would he say well there is water he knew Philip T him that also to be saved like like Peter told there repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you see the gift of the Holy Ghost therefore he knew that the plan Philip was expressing was expounding on everything every detail about the Plan of Salvation and then maybe in his heart now he was saying oh my if only I could get a to place where there is water but he was in a desert the most improbable place to have water right but look when there's a desire in your heart a deep desire in your heart and a true desire blessed desire God Will Make A Way even if the situation is not there God Will Make A Way in the desert where there is no water because the Deep was calling to the Deep there was a deep to respond to the deep that was because the desire was there to be baptized God in that desert created a pool of water deep enough for him to be baptized and God can do the same thing for you it's only for you to express the desire from the bottom of your heart Lord I want this which is something scriptural which is something according to his will when you express the desire of God will make a way where there is no way and the other one is Galatians when Paul would be saying to them you were running well what happened you what did who did hinder you now I I need to get to my text that's why I tell you we would never have seen what he T by brother sister that's right you were our eyes in the message that's why I'm going to close after 1 hour the message persever when I was reading that that's why you never read the message like a newspaper don't do that never that's right read it carefully because it's our manner it's our Heavenly manner he said in the message perseverant fish Mark 64 paragraph 7 you said I'm sorry I had to drink some water because I'm dry in the desert here I feel like my my my tongue is dry you know why I asked you that because I I was shocked when I saw brother BR in one of the courts he was like that he was thirsty I was I wept when I ran there when I listened to the he was thirsty but he was he couldn't take the water he was like hesitating then he said he said I'm sorry I see all of you fing your heart and me drinking water in front of you might really hurt you but please let me take a sip of water look how he was let me take a water this Greek parag this Greek had heard these words that is the cenan woman look at the eyes of a prophet now she believed it she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any faith knows no hindrance am her faith had no hindrance she had but her faith didn't have you may have hindrances but if you got faith it knows no defeat it's positive yeah let's look at some of her hindrances just for a moment that's what I like this Prophet I've been reading the Bible so many years I've been teaching from the Bible I could never show those things we need the eye of a prophet that's why the Bible has become a new book he said some of them I want you to follow me now might have said look at the first hindrance she was leaving a a pagan country tired inide she was crossing over over into into the the land of the Jews the Jewish land now she was going now for the healing of her daughter Cru the fact cruy tormented by a devil because she was healing she was going forth for a need I want you to listen now I don't think I've come here for for nothing there should be something if I can only reach one person tonight I I'd be very happy she was coming for a need and the devil knows about that she will try to throw any kind of hindrance he he he would just to stop you went into the thought went into the the Bible don't describe anything of that yes but the Bible has become a new book right he said that some of them might have said remember you are of A different race amen cuz she was a Greek you are a Greek by Nation but he's a Jew in other words today you would say your denominations not having this revival it makes no difference your denomination whether it is or not that woman didn't care whose denomination it was she was a human being are we human beings yeah she was a human being amen had been created by God and she had a need do you have a need tonight amen she had a need and she had faith and she was going to get it whether her denomination was cooperating or not made her no difference she start it off see one of one of the main problem Len because I've been faced with it that's why I'm telling you tonight without I'm not I'm not trying to talk to about anybody when I just came the message about 3 months after I met with someone who was in charge of a of a great thing in the message of the hour I won tell you you you try to to to guess who he is I was young 3 months in the message or four months I remember he came to morish and the way he acted before me because he was of under the race I was shocked I see I was treated like a slave brother I cried I said I just came a message that was for me the right thing to do but that man so many years in the message of the hour and representing such a such an office in the message of the hour and the way he talked to me and he treated me that then I've learned something from Brother Becket kill them by love kill them by Love Therefore I went to a shop I bought an expensive souvenir very expensive yes I gave it to him as a gift amen that man crumble to the ground yes he asked forgiveness and he became one of my best friends praise the Lord amen look racism in the message Circle you are a cenan he's a Jew he's of a higher class he said in the the greatest b battle ever fought paragraph he said and I'm sure that sister Bell loved our Lord she was a good woman now she's one of us in here we don't have any lines of color Yes the family of God doesn't draw lines of color whether we are red brown black or yellow doesn't matter why whatever it is we are brothers and sisters in and we love her and we'll miss her the Tabernacle how will I miss sister Bell them great big Co amens back there in the corner and taking her up home she would talk about the Lord Jesus racism that's one of the obstacle that prevented that woman from going to meet Jesus Christ the second said I want you to listen to the words carefully she might have had another critic the second ones that might have met her down the line and said why the days of Miracles is passed we don't have Miracles no more don't don't let the devil tell you that at any God is still on the scene God is still he God still does Miracles why the days of Miracles is p we don't have Miracles no more that could have been a Jew after she got in her over this country where Jesus was across into Galilee there's a miracle SP there's no such a thing still she was persistent she was persevering the denational barrier didn't stop her neither did anything sorry anything any of them who believe the days of Miracles was passed she knew different we should know different first thing I want you to to grasp those the words first thing she had something inside of her right we we're going to see those words coming again therefore what was propelling her she had something in the eyes of her inside of the criticism whatever she was whatever obstacle whatever hindrances were put in front of her that something was inside of her am today I can say if I come to that message whe whe what I did before I know I'm sad I regret but I know that there was something inside of us God has put a seed there before the foundation of the world there would be nothing to hinder a True Believer predestinated for this hour nothing can hinder Hallelujah listen there was something inside of her that told her that she would get what she asked for Hallelujah whether there was those people causing hindrances but some was inside of her listen I like that she had something I'm telling you we had a god of the present day amen do you believe that don't you worry about what people are saying this and that in the Queen of Sheba preach 10 J 6 now the little lady had some hindrances which is Queen of shba and every person that tries to come to Christ will find hindrances let me say it again and every person that comes to Christ will find hindrances it's everywhere you just start it one time and find out start a closer walk with God find out what will happen just try it the devil is at the door to stop you every day but yet I'm going to go because my soul seres for the Living God now that's that was the second obstacle I'm sorry I made a move that changeed some of my text here let me put it back again then he said oh people tonight if you can only hold that in your heart that God is here to give you the desire of your heart amen if you will meet his conditions nothing can stand amen he said now the Third paragraph 76 there might have been a bunch of women come to her said look sister Leia brother even give her a name sister Leia and orever whatever a name might have been do you understand that your husband will leave you if you do this no doubt but what she loved her husband but she she couldn't curse or bless that what which was in her yes there was something inside of her something was telling her daughter was dying with epilepsy and she had to get to Jesus and when she got there something was going to take place husband or no husband God want us to be positive like that don't have a negative thought about things in the message law preach 15th January 55 he said now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people and they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you are just talking his language right then see you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time you say I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart you confess that Hallelujah let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to comeing in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it when you say I can't help the thought from coming well that's that would be like the fer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his PR but he could choose chop them from roosting so that's a good thing you see you can't help your the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them look at David look at at Moses before the Egyptians were killed he would tell them those Egyptians that you see now you will see them no more it was having a positive confession David will tell Goliath I'm going to slay you I'm going to kill you because I a circumcised you you cannot treat me like that he was confessing something positive he knew that God will back up his word I don't know about the name of that man maybe G he told God if you give me the victory over my the battle I'm going to fight I'm going to give you the first thing that comes out of my house and when he came out Victorious the his only daughter came out running the and he cried he said oh no oh no oh no but you already made the vow that the first that comes out of my of my house I'm going to sacrifice it for you oh no and the daughter could have told the father you know it's you who made the vow I'm still a virgin I've got me to marry maybe later now you want to sacrifice me because you made the vow you're the one to be to be blamed they she could have she could have asked her father let me go for three months you know cry over my vcy and then she could have gone but even the daughter valued a vow she has been taught the right thing she valued The Vow and that man sacrific his daughter because of the vow if a man can keep his vow what about God who made a promise God he keep his vow if he said that the Lord who Health you God he heal [Music] me he's the God who keeps his vow some of them might have said this is obstacle four what are you going to do with this Afflicted child if it fails all those things not look at a woman look at us when we are about to go for our healing for our blessing for our whatever we have been praying for the devil will hit at you but keep confessing the right thing keep praying keep believing I don't know why I'm preaching this message there's someone here who needs to hear that that the devil is cramming your mind with negative thought of Ang you die tell him no God has the final say for my life [Applause] prise Lord some of them have said oh well what are you going to do with this Afflicted child if it fails that she know it wasn't going to fail amen the third time said something was in her that told her it can't fail if if he ever was God if he ever was God He Still Remains God it can't fail before she was persent in the message perseverance 19th June 64 paragraph 27 are you okay with me give you maybe off off he said when God tells something that's going to happen like the Visions or something I've seen tens of thousands of them and many of you are a witness not one of them have ever failed amen I don't care what they saying this never happened this never happened I don't care for me everything happened what the prophet said everything happened babbe it never happened like you thought it would happen but it happened that God saw it happened and I believe we are going to get all the answers when we get over there God will show us that everything that he has been said through the mouth of the Prophet has happened really do you believe that yeah I believe it yes that not one of them has ever failed and When God says anything look at that that that release strucking my mind he would if we would say tonight go to the National Cemetery I'm going to raise up George Washington in the morning I invite the whole world come watching Geor Washington if you go there there's only dust there's no more bones there's no more hair there's no more I don't know whether they they be teeth left with him nothing but he said now if the Lord tell me to go I'll invite the whole world I invite I invite Fox News CNN BBC you think about them because that that will make the history of the world all those big things will be coming there and now if it doesn't happen my they will chase that PO poor man I would invite the whole world he said why because it's going to happen God word Can't Fail amen he has never failed amen and he can't fail there's one thing God can do and that's fail he cannot fail and God is his word you believe that look how many times he STR on the fact that God cannot fail and for you why would he fail no the fifth obstacle then some of them that I've said the circle that you belong to in the society will laugh at you she said laugh or no laugh made her no difference yes something was inside of her the fourth time brother BR saying there was something inside of him I believe that we have that that's why over the years have been persevering IIT all those criticism if we would ask you why do you are you still here you say I don't know but something inside of me keeps Shing something inside of me keeps me here wasn't ashamed thank you the six obstacle some of them that I said you will be put out of your church he said put out or not put out she was on a road yes something pulling pulling her to Jesus yes amen I [Music] the I feel the pull something was pulling her there was nothing going to stand in her way no hindrance she was perseverant nothing stood in her way I have some quotes from The Bible but I won't read just to come to my point finally she arrived where he was that's the S obacle I was shocked when I heard that six obstacle she went through she had been able to resist something in her was putting her that was Jesus Christ now she came in front of the person for whom she had been undergoing all this trouble yes she come in front of him then finally she arrived where he was I'm going to to read a quote don't strumble over that quote because I'm going to link that quote with that last obstacle in a message for me brother whether is is it 47 48 5355 is the message of the hour there are Treasures laid up in that message he said paragraph 18 the message the seven compound names of Jehovah yes preached on 20th January 55 he said now we want to make our quotation and now I've written out on the envelope here that I carried the seven compound names of Jehovah in other words it was what Jehovah is is made up in these seven Redemptive names of his yes now look at those word now his attitudes toward the people from Eden Back to Eden that was the story of read Redemption because we are out we have we have been out of Eden that's what the the three four four one of the three four purpose of God to bring us back to Eden from Eden Back to Eden is wrapped in these seven redemp names amen if brother says it it's true yes do you believe that if you want to know the whole story of redemption even the book of redemption is is laked with that with that trip that that that trip now from Eden Back to Eden yes is contained in those names yes then he would say the first one being Jehovah Gyra right there on the Mount of Mariah he provid to Ibraham the the the the the ram yes the second is Jehovah Rafa he said the one the Lord the Healer then he would said those two are connected together yes because you know why that's why when Abraham was asking God you telling me I'm going to have a hair to my to to my possessions I don't understand how because you have left me with only a then God will bring you bring him out of the tent he was in the tent God bring him out the tent say look now look look can you can you remember those Stars sometimes we don't see these these great things from God because we we are still in the tent am yes we remain too much in the tent get out of the tent get out of these five senses then you will see the the things of God you will see the promises of God get out from under your T when he came out then he saw then God show him that great you know Vision about the the turtle does and whatever the the the the the birds do not separate them which is the the healing will be in the Old Testament and the New Testament and then the three animals it was the Plan of Redemption he said Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Rafa then manasa man our Banner Shalom our peace Ro Shepherd and then Sid K right says and Sh yes the Lord is there was the seventh one the last one that is all those steps to bring us back to to the Garden the last one is Jehovah Jehovah sh the Lord present God will be here in the flesh I think you're getting what what I'm getting getting to that's why when she she the that lady she did those seven steps yes and finally she comes into God in flesh and that was the main hindrance yes she said that I've gone through all these now I came before The Very one for whom I've been suffering all the shame I've been suffering now I come in God in flesh he's ping me out praise the Lord and that's today our problems in the of we don't we couldn't understand that sorry I'm not I don't believe in the dity of brother brother but I do believe that God chose a vessel yes an earth vessel in these days amen God wanted to manifest himself plainly to the people as why why would you why would he do those demonstration about turning his back who is this man right was trying to show that the same God that appeared to appeared to Abraham there by the T he was the same God heating with us fishing with people the same go in the flesh but people were afraid of the very thing that God sent us to save us from this Darkness where we were amen when Christ left the mountain when he told the disciples go I'm going to pray on the mountain those scriptures became alive and I'm telling you because the Bible became a new book when Christ went in the mountain by the he went to the r birs of Glory he was praying for the church during the seven Church ages the vot was a church that 10,000 Devils swore to drown those people their saes were torn up the the the the the the OES the OES were broken there was no hope for life it's no this here hell the he the lead the cover of hell has been Lo hell is loose on the earth 10,000 devils in those dark times L dark there and Christ was in the mountain there 2,000 years doing intercession for the for the for the church yes when he saw that they are Bing there will be no hope for them he came underwater the fourth night the fourth uh watch of the night yes fourth is the number of Deliverance yes right he was coming for deliverance do you believe that that's what he preached and then Jesus came and he called he said four is the number of Deliverance Israel was in Egypt for 400 years then they were delivered the three Hebrew children the fourth one came yes when Ezekiel measured the water for the Revival there the vision of the Revival he measured the water up to the ankle level and to the knee level to the waste level and the fourth one was too much water they had they they had to to to to swim we we've had you know in the countdown we've had what oh my Luther Wesley Pentecost but we are above Pentecost we have the word of the hour we've had the the the uh the the St the then the tussle whatever the the husk then then the seed again which is the fourth change do you believe that we had the curtain the the bamboo curtain which is the Chinese then the Iron Curtain Russia then the purple curtain the Catholic church romanism we got a four curtain amen beyond the credit over time that's where that's where lies our deliverance number four it has always been like that if you read the message the restitution of the of the of the Bride tree but the Bible said that the first day when when Christ was resurrected the first day the second day he was dead he was still dead Friday he was still dead but the third day there was a rumor that he was that he was alive it's Pentecost a rumor with speaking in tongues with noise there was noise around you look I'm scared where you look at me like that it's in the message of Y amen it's in theage of Y but the fourth what he appeared unto them amen in the room with me don't be afraid it was a personal presence of Christ at the four and that's what happened in this generation yes and that lady was coming through all those stages of obstacle to finally come in his present that's why he said now Christ when he was on the mountain he came down and that message has been preached 12 times look on your table 12 times it is I be not afraid he's trying to express to them you you're being afraid he's a ghost see it's not a ghost it's me yes but and mo amen I'm under the form I've taken on the form but it's still me amen I'm telling the message of the hour it's Jesus Christ the Sai forever and the Very message that God sent to Deliver Us from Leia we were afraid of it amen but it's me being Not Afraid and he walked up on the water oh my let me let me get get back to my text I'm closing when you hear me say three times I'm closing then you know I'm closing it's the first time many people think just because you get where he is at it's all over that's wrong you have come to church you see that is blasting my mind because I like to read that that the promise in the scripture where two or three are gathered in my name and they in the midst of you I've come based on that scripture is here but look what is saying now just because you get where he is at it's all over that's wrong why amen the Propet has a way to blast your mind he can come here in this building tonight yes and show himself alive now he's trying to say that in those meetings Christ was showing himself alive yes in need service Christ in the flesh again behind the Flesh of a human being yeah they could realize that it was not William Bram here he would say I got remember what I said I've got to go get to the text I will listen what I told you what what did I tell you what did I tell you he couldn't even know what he tell the lady in front of him because you know what it wasn't him it was God using a human body am and people were afraid of God's Praises among them amen can I take one more minute said I won't read I won't look he said that the P I've got the quote now here in one of the early messages faith in the sub said the Pentecostal they have been looking for a gift of healing for many years they have been praying for God to send a gift I'm telling you that to show you that that we've had God in flesh again yes and if you ask me where is he today he's you and me amen the bride is God in flesh again and people don't realize let me show you you are the one who be able to give eternal life to to one person and get another one good Hallelujah that's the power you you have in you right now do you believe that because you are representing Christ on Earth amen you are Christ you are Messi yet do you believe that amen that's why you must use that power today speak things into existence and God knows whom to use he used brother he used a woman in the first instance sister hat right because he knew God knew that she would say the right thing that's right oh my he said that the Pentecostal have been looking for a gift of healing we think that the gift is a gift like the Pentecostal thing a gift is a person yes they have been praying for a gift of healing for for 40 years he said that God moved the orbits I've got the quote I won't read it maybe a 76 5th in the said but God moved the orits yes 37 years ago and gave it to you what was it the birth of William brother amen count the days it was the birth of brother Bram was the gift that God sent to the world of the gift is not what we thought was a gift it was a person that's what Christ would say to the one at the well if you know the gift of God and who is the one who is asking for water you would have asked yourself the gift of God God so loved the world that he gave amen his only begot son a gift is a person amen do you believe that amen when the little Dam from the time of n she told the the the mistress if my if my master knows he she look at your Bible she never said if my master knows there is Jehovah Rafa in Israel look at the Bible she said if my master knows there's a prophet there's a prophet because a prophet is a gift of healing amen there's a prophet there she had the exact address the name and she he had to go through all the protocol you know he had to go his King get a letter for from his King to show to the king of Israel when the king of Israel got the letter he say oh am I he tore away his clothing because he went to the wrong address the little damel gave the right address you know what I when I like that little D when I came to to to Phoenix the first time behind the old Pulpit of the ram he put me there I was preaching on that Pulpit I said you know what I came to America everybody's asking me who is morius on those days there was no touch screen you know iPhone and no touch screen the nobody could enlarge the the world map and see macius no it was a little do you're hardly perceptible on the on the world map they maybe about 98% of the people who were here in America where is morius I was tired to answer all those questions where is morius where is I could explain then I I got inspired I came the ppit I preach the unknowns of the Bible and said who knew the man who gave his his cult to Jesus Christ from him to Mountain we don't know the name of the man he is the man who gave his house for the master to celebrate Easter we don't know the man the man who who is the man who is that what is the name of that little girl which tribe she belong to the one who talk to neb yeah we don't know that unspoken Heroes if ever you don't hear your name from the ppit don't be angry you are a spoken hero be happy you don't have to hear your name I'm sorry about that sorry I'm sorry sorry because sometime we want to hear our names you know that damel told him go see the prophet now when he went when he went there to the prophet look what what happened the prophet stayed in the home NE never saw the prophet only the messenger the the the what the servant gazi he was the one who took the words of the Prophet The Go tell him to deep seven times in Jordan therefore the healing of name was totally dependent on the faithfulness of the servant who would say what the tape say he had to say exactly what the T said don't put anything else in there he came out and he said exactly what he heard from Elijah from Elisha go and deep seven times and when he went there he got a change of the body seven seats were open he did seven times and he came out his body was changed do you believe that just listen to the T listen to the word of the Y listen to your pastor who just every time we relate to you talk to you about the I'm sure you will get through I'm closing with this praise the Lord oh my what's happening God set a gift the very one that she came she come believing in turn him turn her down but then but but something in her was pering inside of her telling her go when she got there to him he turned her down flat and besides that he said a race was nothing but a bunch of dogs it's not me for me to take the children's blood and feed it to dogs come on but if you got a hold and something has got a hold of you is going to be different Hallelujah finally she got what she had been looking for what I'm what what I tried to preach you tonight we had a marvelous message amen God came back in flesh don't be afraid of this message of Y don't be afraid to testify on it your healing is in there the message of Y has your healing while we are preaching because healing can come while preaching the word he said his word and his word he's there and sure tonight if you can only take the word I've been preaching to you believe the message there believe the prophet believe the word of God believe that he's still the Healer you can benefit from all what I'm saying therefore for the Christian there is no hindrance even I've been talking about hindrances there there is no hindrance something inside of you you've got something inside of you God is going to pull you through all your difficulties I don't want to be hypocrite tell do anything else this and that but I believe that if you keep the word god God keeps his word if we believe his word we go through whatever we are going through with faith God will honor his promises and if you're sick tonight God will heal you you want a touch from God whatever kind of a touch you want a holy ghost you want peace you want your children to come back home you want the backsliding backsliding to come back home everything you want from God which is according to his will just believe no hindrances no obstacle will ever prevent
