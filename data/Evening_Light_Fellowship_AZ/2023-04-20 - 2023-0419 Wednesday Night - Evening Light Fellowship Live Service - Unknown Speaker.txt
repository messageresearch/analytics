gone brother Ron received a call just before his service brother Arnold's 96 year old mother has passed away so let's remember brother Arnold pray the Lord be with him at this time and comfort him I think he's probably going to take some time by himself just grieve the loss of his mother and just sometimes you just need that time alone so pray for our Beth brother Arnold and just be his strength and his portion brother Matt vasaki is not feeling well tonight and as well brother Austin Johnson is not able to be here as well as that you remember our niece in Tucson her two-year-old daughter Ivy has been hospitalized for the last few days with pneumonia so if you remember a little Ivy Miller in prayer tonight be greatly appreciated we're gonna have our pastor come tonight and the Lord in prayer [Music] amen God bless you all this evening I wanted to give you a an update on brother Neil you all know that he had what they call an aortic dissection [Music] which is the aorta coming out of the top of the heart it it almost burst you know he had a heart attack they came in there and repaired that but all of the debris they call it the trash that was in the aorta fleshed out into his system and the uh they call his [Music] his medical condition trash foot you can look it up and what it is is all of the little things let's call it trash that came from the top of the heart all to the capillaries the smallest little carriers of blood throughout your body are in your fingers your nose and your toes and so what happens is it looks like frostbite starts to turn red then eventually turns black because it dies it's not getting blood flow they he saw a podiatrist yesterday and the podiatrist came in and he said uh we have watched this Condition it's been eight or nine weeks now since the heart attack I believe may be longer and um both feet are turning black and they are telling him um that they will amputate both of his feet below the knee [Music] yeah I want you to really be in prayer for brother Neil he's a man of the outdoors he loves to hunt he loves to hike he loves to fish and everything and yet even when he got the news yeah I took it a little bit hard but then even today sister Karen said he was he was kind of joking about certain things and and everything uh and yet um my heart is heavy and they asked well how soon do you want to actually do the operation and they said it's kind of up to him they said both feet are dead there is no blood circulation that are going to the feet he has on his hands and blackened tips on a couple his right thumb is black on the tip they may amputate that first digit over here they don't know just how far again what they have to do is to to find out how far is the blood flow because if there is no blood flow then what happens is that finger that digit that foot whatever it is it just turns black black and and and it's actually dying it's called necrosis and I believe that God can if he can raise the Dead I never say it's too late I would love to see that he wakes up in the morning and his toes are pink I just believe God is still God and I know that he is a Healer and I'm just asking God once again as we go

it's uh it's what gives us the the ability to Rise Above It All We spread our wings and soar above the Heights [Music] boat of sales on a troubled sea ever there's a wind in myself [Music] but I have

greater than the former amen I will uh thank you for your prayers last March when I went to Mexico truly I I feel the presence of the Lord wherever I go if somebody is praying for me and truly there was 10 people accepted Christ and that's our heart's desire to look for the last one so that we can go somewhere we can go to our Heavenly Father amen forgive me of my English um I have a photos actually at the show I think it's only five photos so that was the first meetings in Veracruz Mexico as you can see there's a white brother over there that Zachary Wallace he was with me and truly it was a big blessings you can see those ministers was praying that they want to feel the Holy Ghost in their hearts so that they can bring that to to their churches and preach the gospel that's uh in Oaxaca platinar so uh I think 60 of the Bill of the people over there are denominational uh believers and then the that's why there were like 10 people got baptized so that's the we baptize the people [Music] foreign the black brother is our interpreter he he came from Cameroon and he studied here in the United States as a nurse and now he's practicing a nurse in the in Texas and then uh all of the sudden he God give him a gift as a Spanish speaker so he's a preacher and uh uh interpreter so that brother over there um if you can see uh next to his wife that man was a transgender uh before and this man was uh uh an addict at the same time he was a prostitute in Mexico I forgot that but it's in the close to the very nice resort in in Mexico but then God called him and now he's married and right now his wife is pregnant because of the message of the hour God can change the vilest man in the world the cheapest of Sinner amen good to see you brother Bill Billy Billy okay so let us stand and I want to uh share with you most of the messages of brother Andreas when I was talking to brother Michael and brother Mark I told him brother Andreas took hundred percent of my preaching so I cannot change it because it's already completed the Bible said in hagai Chapter 2 Verse 3 I will read up to the ninth this is the question that we need to recognize our position in the last days hey guy chapter 2 verse 3 who is left among you that saw this house in her first Glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing yet now be strong osiruba Bell said the Lord and be strong o Joshua son of basudeik the high priest and be strong all the people of the land said the Lord and work for I Am With You said the Lord of hosts according to the word that I come covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt so my spirit remain it among you fear ye not for thus sat the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of the All Nation shall come and I will fill this house with Glory said the Lord of hosts the silver is mine the Gold is mine said the Lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former set the Lord of hosts and in this place I will give peace said the Lord of hosts let's bow our heads father as you said Lord to Elijah and Elisha Lord that this Elisha wants the power of Elijah so bad and he asked a hard thing Lord a double portion of the power of Elijah but you said I will give this to you and you will carry more power than Elijah now father it's your word again as this title Lord God we will read about this uh this house this present Temple Lord is greater than the former use my lips Lord speak to my lips oh I I ask you Lord God I'm an educated person but we want your Holy Ghost Lord God to preach your gospel Lord Jesus just use me Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have a seat the Bible said actually the prophet was telling us why we're going and spread this gospel because we have the the the the the uh the the uh Covenant that this gospel must be preached to hold to the whole world that's why the prophet said here in the message my new ministry he said his program cannot move without you and I that's powerful God the creator of Heaven and Earth God made this world but then now in the last days he cannot move without you and me and as long as we're not doing what God led us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moved by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are Gods uh we are in God's will doing his program now you will know why I'm going to the mission field I thank you for your prayers I thank you for your support brother Ron but one day people will come and Shake Your Hand and you don't even know them but because you sent me because you prayed for me you are the crown also you will receive a crown also because you sent me to this lost and dying world amen the prophet said here in the Patmos vision he said God is depending upon his church God is relying on us of this age to bring this Gospel Light to a dying heat and bound traditional world God is laying the burden on you and me and Wu unto us if the heat and dies without knowing amen praise the Lord now I will preach amen this is I'm not a a teacher I'm an evangelist but I was God is leading me to this uh uh scriptures and it's so hard because this is like a teaching service amen so hey guy when when when God called Jeremiah and told Jeremiah you need to tell to the tell tell to the children of Israel that one day they will go into captivity in Jeremiah chapter 25 verse 11 and this whole land shall be desolation and as as an an astonishment and this nation Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years there's only one law and the the Israelites the the Hebrews needs to follow and that law is what you you saw is the same thing we will reap sowing and reaping and the law of God is the same thing today what you saw is what you reap but because they saw and worshiped idols fornications now God allowed the Heathen to captive them for 70 years but then in Jeremiah chapter 29 10 for thus said the Lord that after 70 years there's a promise be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good words toward you in causing you to return to this place God has a promise because God still the children of Israel are his Apple beside amen and here God anointed Ezra and then uh Ezra was was uh writing this and then when the the Babylonian lost the battle and then here's the King of Persia King Cyrus he said in Ezra chapter 1 now in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia what the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that he made the proclamation throughout all the kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus said the Lord Cyrus King of Persia the Lord God Of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he had charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah and then here the children of Israel went back to their Homeland that was good but then when they went back to their Homeland they forgot that their purpose to go back to their Homeland is to build the temple and worship again my mouth is dry I'm shaking here in Ezra chapter 10 13 and when the builders lay the foundation of the Temple of the Lord they set the priest in their apparel with trumpets and Levites the son of Assad with symbols to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David king of Israel and they sung together by course embracing and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his Mercy endure it forever toward Israel and all the people shouted with great Shout when they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid but many priests here's here's our I'm I'm going but many of the priests and Lee bites and heads of the father's house old men who have been the first temple whipped with a loud voice when the foundation of the temple was laid before their eyes yet many shouted aloud for joy so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of Joy from the noise of the Weeping of the people for the Weeping for the people shouted with a loud shout and the sound was here afar up the children that was born from Babylon was so excited to go back to to Jerusalem to build the temple but when they were building the Temple they were happy they were shouting for Joy they were praising God but the people that was there before saw the building of the Temple of Solomon was crying with a loud voice screaming how poor is this second temple this staple is so ugly I can see when the Temple of Solomon was built the precious stones from different countries they brought The Cedars from Babylon they brought it was a glorious day that was but then when they saw the second temple they were crying they were whipping our God is a poor God well as brother Andreas was preaching about the second Chronicles chapter 5 13. it said they remembered those old men that was there they remembered that it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and then when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to Ministry by the reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled that house with God I remember those days the old people said I was there when the cloud came down I was there I was shaking because of the presence of the Lord and the priest can administered because of the presence of the Lord think about it right now your position right now they did not know that God is is prophesying about the future Temple foreign so here is the ministry that hey guy was prophesying it's not a temple that build with hands God is prophesying to a temple that's inside of the flesh not the building in Isaiah 53 the Bible said who had believed a report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the dry ground he had no nor calmliness and when he shall see him or we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him that's the temple that that that hey guy was projecting to the people but the the the the so-called children of God cannot understand the ministry the the the the the revelation of God now here the prophet said in the identified Christ of all ages he said because he was the word that made that that age was identified in a human body a boy that had no education that we never know him going to school we had no credentials he even come out of any organization of that day no education no reputation of nothing but a crazy man a wine Bieber a friend of Sinner a man turning the world upside down illegitimately born his mother was pregnated by a soldier and taking his name as a Son of God or a calling himself a prophet this Galilee and so-called prophet but the word was made flesh as many as received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God how many of you receive him tonight and you received him already now we have the power and God called you the Sons and Daughters of God amen now here's Jesus Christ standing in the in the midst of the high priest and Jesus in Matthew chapter 12 6 he said but I say unto you that in this place is one greater than the temple and that high priest was who are you I know you're you're you're uh uh a man that doesn't have a credential who are you they did not know that God made flesh God bailed in this body called Jesus now here in in John Chapter 2 19 20. I'm just laying down the foundation Jesus answered and said unto them destroyed this Temple and in three days I will raise it up then said the Jews 40 and six years we built this Temple and you will destroy it in three days you will raise it up no revelation blinded think about it today but they forgot the message of hagai who is left among you that saw this house in her first Glory and now how do you see it now that's the question but then God said the glory of this latter house is greater than the former set the Lord of hosts all this place will be given peace set the Lord opposed now I'm going to my direction in the message is this the sign of the answer that's the question here is brother Jackson had a dream he said and said then you pick up something like from the air something like a A Wrecking Bar a crowbar wasn't it oh brother something like that A A Wrecking Bar real sharp and said it's how you done it and I don't know and said you struck the top of that mountain and rip it around and lifted the cup of it off how that was months and months and months before the pyramid message I will jump to 131. and said look upon this light when when brother Branham on the dream with a sharp rod or a crowbar cut the top of the mountain or or The Rock and that rock came out there was a white stone now it said and upon before and when all of them got up and I told them to watch that and all of them come up to look in all of them the people that was following the prophet look on that but he said while they were looking in he looked out of the corner of his eyes I believe it was and watch me slip up to one side and started going towards the West towards the seating of the Sun coming up a hill going down a hill coming up a hill going down a hill getting smaller and smaller and went all the way out of sight yeah here's the people that was looking on that white stone revelation Jesus Christ you need to keep your eyes on him not to the ministry but here the people that was following the prophet and he said when I did that he said that the Brethren turn around after a while said did he vanish where's brother Branham I want to see brother Branham they forgot the message they forgot to look on the White Stone where's the prophet I cannot live without the prophet he's my life I need I need him to come back because without him I'm not perfect and weigh some look one way and some another but a few stayed and look on what I had told them and I believe brother Ron that's me and you that's all of us here that will stay what the prophet said that we will lock on Jesus Christ oh brother I don't want to go ahead of my the prophet said here in the god hiding himself in simplicity he said but God in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel think of it remembered my first coat you and I Without You and I gonna God cannot perform his purpose but here the prophet said he can use the son to preach the gospel or the wind to preach the gospel or an angel to preach the gospel see without Revelation brother if an angel will come without wings maybe we will listen to to that angel more than me but then if you have a revelation better than the angel who is greater angels that protecting you or the angel in the pulpit that's a big question of the prophet but here he said but uh uh he ordered the man for that purpose and he never changed it he never ordained the nomination he never ordained groups of men he ordained men to preach the gospel a machinery brother Ezra amen not the machinery or our mechanical devices or an Angelic being it was men so thankful that God opened our eyes brother Robert how can we say all we can say is thank you Lord amen amen that there's so many rich and famous and smart people that's still listening to the tape Brothers I love the prophet hundred percent or maybe hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times percent somebody told me go watch the Youtube you can see a man and a woman married by the tape I thought it was it's a joke but when I listened to that brother this message is true this message is hundred percent God made manifest but the people that came in brought their denominational ideas you know what happened they make this message a cult I am jealous I am zealous Brothers that's why salvation is individual salvation a pew know that this church is right stay with it obey what the preacher is preaching here we believe that there are three kinds of Believers but why choose the two if you're a believer you know I heard so many times the the messages about this they quote this a lot Christ revealed in his own word the prophet said here you must not misinterpret the word you say well I believe it means this it's me it means just what it says it needs no interpreter and you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word and if you or if we would do either of this it would it will throw the whole Bible in a confusion and in a chaos see that's why I just we brother one we stay we we preach what the prophet preach you know the Bible the message said you're not feeding on a man a man this words will fail by your feeding or feeding on the unfail or again again we're not feeding on a man a man his words were fail but you're feeding on unfailing body word of the son of man the prophet was just there but it's in him he is the one I'm just an instrument the minister here is just an instrument the prophet said here in the last days there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice we heard so many times we are the final voice we are in the final Age The Bride is in the final voice he says it's a final voice but you forgot you need to read that before under their messenger we need to stay the message the prophet under their messenger we are the final voice that's important brother now remember I was like reading about this Moses uh the book of Moses when when the when the prophet saw the vision about the the tent in the heaven the temple now Moses followed what he saw and when he saw that the temple it was a tent now why because if the pillar of fire move they move also but here's the desire of David he wants to build a house oh a maid of precious stones Golds and everything but to begin with the the house of the Lord is in the tent because the tent needs to follow what the pillar of fire goes or where the filler pillar of our ghosts are you thankful that in the last days God did not come in the nice Temple in a big 100 millions in in Houston the prophet said here oh how be it or the Bible how be it the most high dwelleth not in Temple made with hands as thus said the Lord or the Saint the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool what house will you build me God is so big that God cannot fit in this house in this church so big that that he cannot that's here or sit here but he choose to be small and wants to live in your soul he become a tiny germ the god the big God that he cannot sit in Temple made with hands but he decided to to become a very tiny germ to live in your heart in my heart I wish you understand that brothers and sisters the prophet said here in this time it's been an evening for so long it's a and then the evening for so long long long time it's a dismal time so a dangerous time remember Twilight is the most dangerous time of all we are in a Twilight now even time the gross Darkness and the prophet said this is the most deceiving time because it's gloomy there's a light but it's so dangerous so he said the most dangerous day you ever live in the Bible said in Matthew 24 it would come to pass in the last days till we were or it it would deceive the very elect cannot be deceived because you know why as I said while ago God cannot live in a big Temple but here the word of God said if the word will come takes a veil brother Raymond it takes a veil or you will die when the the word of God came to Moses his face was shining and it put he put a veil in his face and then when when when when when Jesus came in the manger he was wrapped with swaddling clothes the word is in Baal is it a correct English fail now in the Old Testament God was in Badger skin he needs to put a veil or the high priest needs to cover that because the word of God once there's no covering you cannot enter or you will die but then how precious how how wonderful this our prophet in the Malachi chapter four five and six Luke 17 30. Revelation chapter 10. that God revealed this to us so that we can know the mind of God that we know who we are that's what brother Michael said Don't Preach to me tell me who I am this is this is what I want to know also Lord tell me who I am Who I Am Lord who I am oh but if the spirit of him that raised Jesus Christ from the dead dwelts in you it will Quicken our mortal bodies that's what we are now here's the temple God Genesis God in Greek word he poured out he's all in all the Elohim the great God the self-existing one poured out to his people gymnosis my brother's nuts I love it and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh the latter rain all the power of God that's why you you there's so many that's why there's so many why there's so many doctrines here because they said they cannot see the power of God we need the return of the powerful message the Flesh of the prophet but they forgot that next to them next to them kenosis he poured out his everything to these people to you brother my now the prophet said in everything now he said in everything every time and no scripture can be broken and the same Sun that poured out himself kinos to the day of Pentecost promised to do the same thing in the evening time it's the same the continuation of the book of Acts is here brother I don't know about you but I see Miracles every day go with me I will show you what a miracle working God is in our lives I was with Brother on Monday and we me and brother Mark we were talking and then brother brother David was reminding brother Ron about brother Peregrine when brother Peregrine gave him a offering but all of the sudden he lost but then here Peregrine called him and says Big Brother how do how bad do you want that money how bad do you want that money speak there was a doubt brother Ron but you spoke anyway right and he opened the blood the glove box at the money fell see that's the same God that when the prophet said oh little fishy I will give you life it's the same power today because it's the same holy spirit that was in the prophet as here today Brothers I'm not I'm not joking here uh there's so many false spread preachers false prophets are around the world but if there's false there are genuine also and I believe I'm one of them you're one of them we go Colossians chapter 2 9 for in him dwelleth of the fullness of godhead bodily but then here in Colossians 1 27 Christ in you the hope of glory that's why the prophet the brother brother Andreas was telling us don't put God In The Box let him move to your life Brothers speak the word if you have problem with your weaknesses speak the word Hebrew 12 26. whose voice then shook the Earth see in the time of Moses every time God spoke to the people it shook the Earth but then in the last days brother and God in flesh every time we speak the word brother not the Earth shaking it's not the Earth shakes but now he promised saying yet once more I will shake not the Earth only but also heaven see Brothers you know Paul said when they saw Paul was preaching and so many people come to Christ and the people said we need to stop him because he turned the world upside down Brothers today you hear the news the world is upside down already but God anointed you and me to turn the world back to original position we have a things to do brother Amos we have things to do and big and Powerful oh brother Mark shout out John chapter 14 12. it's the same power here the things that I do you will do also Mark 16 in action this sign shall follow to them that believe as I said to brother one he spoke the word you know Brothers I saw so many miracles in my life how about you and me how about you you will see that if you put yourself you know the prophet said Jesus was so in with the word and he became the word if we are so like putting the word in of God first we will become the word now that's the time you can say oh he walks with me and talks with me a long lights narrow way he lives he lives where in my heart in your heart now the song will become you now it's not a song anymore it's a testimony now you can go to Walmart and people will see word walking sisters please don't cut your hair because you are a testimony oh brother sisters I don't believe in above the knee all the time because there's so many worldly women wearing that above the knee like a woman act like the word please please don't the prophet turn don't turn him down we have so many things to do and you are the Fulfillment of that because he cannot do anything without you question and answer foreign could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that the prophet said see the Miracles that happened to him so many miracles that people thought it was Jesus Christ but here's the answer in one sense of the word that's exactly the truth and another sense of the word it's an antichrist Christ that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of Jesus Christ Our Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist see for that person of the Lord Jesus Christ is sitting at the right hand of the uh of the Majesty on high and it will come again in a great power and Glory but for his life that wasn't him upon me upon me upon you who have him it's exactly the truth and you become Christ oh brother Feed me more tell me more tell me more Elisa remember my message Messiah see the word Messiah means the anointed one now you are if you have the Holy Ghost or the Holy Spirit you become the anointed one see then there's all kinds of anointed ones now watch the Bible anointed one once many of them are anointed the whole thing is in such a great conglomeration of every kind of mix-up and Satan with all his cunningness come in and impersonate it just to the Dutch almost to the DOT there's only one way you can absolutely be sure check the word by word word by word and I was checking by the word by word and it become the the word pointed me brother Amos that I am X that you are the Messiahs the anointed once in your day well brother we have so many things to do tell the world but to be Anointed with his Spirit which bring his own person of his life and to you 95. now when it comes to a creation of things it's true Jesus never writes straight and created anything and brought it into experience he took a substance first he took water and made wine he took bread and made more bread he took fish and made more fish but he promised that greater things than this would be done see you see now it's in more evil day than I was than it was when when he was here see it's still him by you saying your heart we are the temple and Paul quoted that scripture and told to the disciples to the Believers he said no ye not know he not you are the temple it's not in the body of Jesus Christ anymore Jesus Christ his Spirit right now is in you and me now we can sing No ye not know ye not we are the temple no ye not no you're not you are the temple I wish I could sing like brother Mark and brother Robert God he said now the invisible God the word was invincible until it was made flesh and then the word become visible can you see yourself the word become visible brothers and sisters that's why the Bible said in Revelation chapter 21 3 it said and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men is with men and he will dwell where with them and God himself shall be with them and be their God Lord forgive us if we cannot accept this it's too much but I pray brothers and sisters that this Revelation that we got I want to share this to the world that this Temple is greater than before there's so many brothers and sisters right now believing that brother Branham where is he is he where is he but to me the spirit of brother Branham it's in the bride right now the spirit that was in Jesus Christ is in the pride right now don't wait that this Spirit right now will go to Israel as long as we are here the spirit of God is in here we have so many things to do brothers and sisters share the word brother he must share the word God bless you I pray that God bless you uh God will continue to bless you that all of us here will bring the world the word of God to the world Amen brother Ron God bless you [Applause] amen God bless you let's stand together this evening when you begin to realize who you are and then the prophet said one day after I'm gone you begin to catch these things God would not permit it to be done now but he says then you're going to begin to catch that Revelation not of who he is but of Who You Are because the mystery continues you realize you are the mystery of God now being revealed just as Christ was a mystery you're now a continuation of the same mystery just in a different form Eve was a mystery of Adam revealed the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed this is that that was hid down from the ages but it's now made manifest to his Saints what is it Christ in you the hope of glory what kind of people does that make us be oh thank you Lord that you came and gave us a prophet but though we have a prophetic word and though it was spoken saints of God we've got to have the Divine revealer take that spoken word and make it alive to us otherwise we just make it a Creed and a dogma and some kind of teaching oh let the Holy Spirit have his way in our lives and let us come to our position amen amen I prayed brother that as our brother Warren goes over there to Dubai there's a lot of people over there I see a lot a handful of people here uh in the different places he's going and they're asking hey come tell us more of Who We Are I'm not just a worker [Music] but I'm a part of the mystery of
