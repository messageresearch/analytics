[8:14] "Please remember our family and for
[8:16] traveling mercies that we will be
[8:18] leaving on the 28th and be gone for 10
[8:20] days." So, let's remember them as they
[8:21] travel. We have a lot of saints that are
[8:23] traveling this weekend and this summer.
[8:25] May the Lord be with them and give them
[8:27] traveling mercies.
[8:29] When I remember the Garveys, Brother

[8:46] He'll be speaking some special services
[8:47] down there. Pray for brother Steven. The
[8:49] Lord would use him in a mighty way as he
[8:51] travels down there. Brother Mario would
[8:53] like us to remember him. He's still not
[8:55] feeling well. Let's ask the Lord to come
[8:57] by brother Mario's house today and just
[8:59] touch him in a mighty way. Brother
[9:01] Andrew Kennedy, he's not feeling well as
[9:03] well. He's got fever, aches, and playing

[9:26] Fielding, if you'll come lead us in
[9:27] prayer this morning. And everything I go

[10:18] Matt as he leads us in prayer for the
[10:20] needs this morning. Let's all pray.
[10:23] Thank you, heavenly father, for this
[10:24] day, for bringing us here, Lord. We put
[10:27] our lives in your hands, Lord Jesus.
[10:30] We need you this morning, Lord. We need
[10:32] you to reveal yourself to us, Father. We
[10:34] pray for the word, Lord, that it would
[10:37] guide us and lead us and
[10:40] reveal to us your desire in our lives,
[10:42] Lord.
[10:44] Father, we ask for each one of the
[10:46] needs, Lord, for traveling mercies, for
[10:49] James and his family, for brother Steven
[10:51] and Australia. What a great undertaking,
[10:53] Lord. We pray you'd bless the the
[10:55] ministry out there, Lord, and
[10:58] [Music]
[11:00] for all the health needs. Lord, thank
[11:01] you for bringing Brother Jerry back to
[11:03] church, Lord, and heal in his body,
[11:05] Lord. Continue to be with him, Father. I
[11:08] know I have great needs on my heart,
[11:09] Lord. And we just
[11:12] ask for all things in your name, Father.

[11:22] needs, Father. And we put it all in your
[11:24] hands, Lord Jesus. In your precious name
[11:26] we pray. Amen.
[11:29] Amen. You may have your seats this
[11:31] morning. Remember to pray for Israel.
[11:32] And now that the United States is
[11:35] involved with Iran, we're definitely in
[11:37] troublesome times, but we have a God
[11:38] that's got it all in control. Amen. The
[11:42] Lord's good. Can you say amen? Amen.
[11:45] Where could I go but to the Lord?
[11:49] Go to him because he's got all the
[11:51] answers this morning. Living below
[11:56] in this old sinful world
[12:00] hardly a comfort can afford
[12:05] and try being alone
[12:08] to face temptation. So tell me where
[12:13] could I go but to the Lord.
[12:17] Sing it. Where could I go?
[12:21] Where could I go? Oh, seeking a refuge
[12:27] for my soul.

[13:25] Just tell me where could I go but to the
[13:29] Lord.
[13:32] and life here is grand with friends I
[13:36] love so dear and comfort I get from
[13:40] God's own word
[13:43] [Music]
[13:45] when I face the chilling hand of death
[13:49] tell me where could I go but to the Lord
[13:55] oh where could I go
[13:59] where could I roll
[14:02] seeking a refuge for my soul
[14:10] to help me in the end.
[14:14] Where could I go but to the Lord?
[14:18] [Music]
[14:20] So take up your cross
[14:23] and follow Jesus.
[14:27] Oh, take up your cross.

[29:12] And he can calm the storm and make the
[29:17] sun to shine again.
[29:22] I know the master of the wind.
[29:30] Sometimes I soar
[29:32] like an eagle to the high
[29:37] among the peaks. My soul can be found.
[29:43] [Music]
[29:45] An unexpected storm
[29:48] may drop me from the heart.
[29:52] It may bring but it'll ne never bring me
[29:57] down.
[30:01] I know the master ofbody.
[30:10] [Music]
[30:13] [Applause]
[30:16] And he can calm the storm and make the
[30:20] sun to shine again. I know.
[30:25] I know. If you know him this morning
[30:28] with the power of his resurrection, lift
[30:30] your hand and sing.
[30:33] I know the master of the wings.
[30:41] I know the maker of the rain
[30:47] and he can calm the storms and make sun
[30:53] to shine again.
[30:57] I know the master of the wind.
[31:06] Let's just bow our heads.
[31:10] Heavenly Father, what a privilege it is
[31:12] to come into your house once again
[31:16] to learn of you.
[31:19] That we might know you in the power of
[31:21] your resurrection.
[31:23] That we might know our position, our
[31:25] placing. Yes, Lord. That we might have
[31:28] that authority, Father. Because
[31:32] when we're out of position, we have no
[31:34] authority.
[31:36] But when we are positioned in Christ, we
[31:39] can do all things through Christ which
[31:41] strengthens us. Hallelujah. Father, I
[31:44] pray now that you will take what we have
[31:47] studied, what you have placed upon my
[31:49] heart. Let it be transferred to the
[31:52] minds of the people. But most of all,
[31:55] Father, may be transferformed,
[31:58] Father, into a manifestation
[32:01] that our life would live a life that is
[32:04] pleasing to you. Yes, Lord. Father, help
[32:06] us now as we uh come into this portion
[32:09] of the service. We need your guidance.
[32:12] We need your inspiration. We need the
[32:15] quickening power of the Holy Spirit come
[32:17] down. Make the word live to us. Father,
[32:20] we thank you. We praise you. We ask
[32:22] these things for your glory in Jesus
[32:25] Christ's name.
[32:27] Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you, saints.
[32:31] Let's just remain standing if we could
[32:33] please. And uh let's turn to the book of
[32:37] Ephesians
[32:39] chapter 6
[32:41] verses 10-13.
[32:44] We'll go to 2 Corinthians 10. Then 1
[32:47] Corin 1 Timothy 1.
[32:52] Ephesians chapter 6
[32:58] verse 10 through13.
[33:01] Finally my brethren be strong in the
[33:03] Lord.
[33:04] and in the power of his might. Put on
[33:07] the whole armor of God that you may be
[33:10] able to stand against the ws of the
[33:12] devil. Amen. For we wrestle not against
[33:16] flesh and blood, but against
[33:17] principalities,
[33:19] against powers, against the rulers of
[33:22] the darkness of this world, against
[33:25] spiritual wickedness
[33:27] in high places. Amen.
[33:30] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[33:33] of God that you may be able to withstand
[33:37] in the evil day and having done all
[33:41] to stand. Amen. Amen. Turn with me to 2
[33:46] Corinthians chapter 10.
[33:50] 2 Corinthians 10
[33:54] verses 3-5.
[34:00] For though we walk in the flesh,
[34:04] we do not war after the flesh.
[34:08] For the weapons of our warfare are not
[34:12] carnal. Amen. But mighty through God to
[34:16] the pulling down of strongholds. Amen.
[34:20] casting down imaginations and everything
[34:24] that exalteth itself against the
[34:26] knowledge of God and bringing into
[34:29] captivity every thought to the obedience
[34:34] of Christ. Amen.
[34:38] The weapons of our warfare are not
[34:41] carnal. That's right.
[34:44] It's not something that you fight with
[34:45] physical
[34:47] things.
[34:49] So, we've got to know how to war our
[34:52] warfare. Turn with me if you would. 1
[34:54] Timothy 1. First Timothy 1:es 18
[35:00] through 20.
[35:07] This charge I commit unto thee,
[35:11] son Timothy, according to the prophecies
[35:14] which went before on thee, that thou by
[35:18] them mightest war a good warfare,
[35:24] holding faith and a good conscience,
[35:28] which some having put away concerning
[35:31] faith have made shipwreck.
[35:34] of whom is Himenius and Alexander whom I
[35:37] have delivered unto Satan that they may
[35:40] not learn to blaspheme.
[35:42] May God bless the reading of his word.
[35:44] You all may be seated this morning in
[35:47] the presence of the Lord.
[35:51] Now, as I launch off into this uh
[35:56] let's call it a platform because for the
[35:58] next couple services,
[36:01] I'm going to take and
[36:05] launch off into
[36:07] the frontline battles of the end time.
[36:12] And I want all of you to understand that
[36:14] none of you are exempt. Amen.
[36:19] man, woman,
[36:21] child,
[36:24] holy ghost fil,
[36:26] every one of you
[36:29] are going to be subject to
[36:32] powers, principalities,
[36:35] times of deception,
[36:38] spiritual warfare,
[36:41] going to come against you. That's right.
[36:44] We're going to look at it in the
[36:45] physical and in the spiritual realm.
[36:50] We're going to touch onto the realm of
[36:52] demonology.
[36:56] We're going to look at these channels
[37:00] that the enemy will use to come against
[37:03] each one of you.
[37:06] Brother Brennham said the enemy has a
[37:08] lick coming against you
[37:10] and you need to keep that area covered.
[37:13] Amen. That is your Achilles heel.
[37:17] So depending on you, your nature, your
[37:20] character
[37:22] will depend on the area that you need to
[37:24] cover the most.
[37:29] We know right now that there are two
[37:31] kingdoms in conflict.
[37:34] the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of
[37:37] Satan.
[37:39] And so we we know that the battle
[37:41] started in heaven,
[37:44] but Satan was cast out of heaven down to
[37:47] earth and he became the god of this
[37:51] wicked world. Amen. Or this evil age.
[37:55] So now he wants to rise himself above
[37:59] God. That's what he's doing. This is
[38:01] Satan's Eden. That's right. So, he wants
[38:05] to raise himself up above God, make
[38:09] himself as God. And so, now they have
[38:12] this conflict going on. And guess what?
[38:15] It became a human conflict. And we
[38:18] inherited it.
[38:21] And so, every one of us are going to
[38:24] have to fight. And it depends on how you
[38:28] how well you know your enemy.
[38:33] Now, when you study warfare and they
[38:35] study ambush
[38:37] techniques,
[38:39] you have to know what to look for in an
[38:42] ambush.
[38:47] Because the enemy that you can spot is
[38:50] not the one that will kill you. That's
[38:52] right. It is a guy camouflage that is
[38:55] hidden
[38:56] that is up in the tree or is somewhere
[38:59] that is hiding behind some sort of a
[39:02] camouflage
[39:05] that you don't recognize.
[39:08] That's the one. That's why they say
[39:09] those men that were that walked point
[39:13] in the jungles of Vietnam,
[39:17] they said they had to be a trained
[39:19] seasoned warrior.
[39:22] They look for booby traps.
[39:24] They look for something that they said
[39:27] there was something that those men had a
[39:30] sense,
[39:32] an ability when they're walking into a a
[39:35] valley, into an area, all of a sudden
[39:39] something
[39:42] told him something's wrong.
[39:48] And he would put his hand up. All the
[39:51] men would stop. He may tell them to
[39:52] drop.
[39:54] Not knowing what's going to happen, not
[39:56] even knowing for sure if it is an
[39:59] ambush, but there was a sense that he
[40:02] had that he could tell his men why he's
[40:05] wanting to protect his men. Amen.
[40:08] And I believe saints of God that we have
[40:11] entered into a conflict in the end time
[40:15] right now where the enemy is doing all
[40:18] that he can to try to deceive, destroy.
[40:22] Amen. Separate
[40:26] and do everything he can to take you out
[40:29] of the battle. Amen.
[40:34] So we know the contest is on. Amen.
[40:39] You better learn to fight.
[40:42] You know, I thought I would just give
[40:45] you a little bit of an idea of the
[40:48] direction in which I want to go. But I
[40:51] want to uh before I I read the
[40:54] scriptures, I did not give it to the
[40:55] brethren. But if you you brethren want
[40:57] to pull up Judges 3:es 1 through3, pull
[41:01] that up in a minute and then we'll show
[41:03] the brethren. But this is uh the title,
[41:06] the revealing of the open book. Now, we
[41:09] all rejoice. Praise God. The open book.
[41:13] We're eating from the open book. And and
[41:15] as we eat and it's sweet in my mouth,
[41:18] bitter in my belly.
[41:25] And so the revealing of the open book
[41:27] was actually a declaration of war.
[41:34] And I want to take for a subject as the
[41:37] spiritual warfare at the end time. Got a
[41:41] quote where I'm going to show you.
[41:42] Brother Bram says, I want to show you
[41:44] where the frontline battles are
[41:46] happening today.
[41:49] It'll happen in all of your lives.
[41:53] If you're single or if you're married,
[41:57] if you have children, if you don't have
[41:59] children,
[42:02] He's going to do everything that he can
[42:06] to try to destroy you. If you're
[42:08] married, he's going to try to destroy
[42:10] your marriage.
[42:12] You need to know how to fight this
[42:14] fight. Amen.
[42:16] And then if you and your wife are
[42:18] getting along and then you have children
[42:19] and they raise up, they come to an age
[42:22] and guess what? If you even though you
[42:25] have trained them up in the way they
[42:27] should go,
[42:28] sometimes they don't go that way.
[42:32] You need to teach them war.
[42:35] Now, I'm going to show you. Let's go to
[42:37] the book of Judges, chapter,
[42:41] let's see here. Judges 3.
[42:44] So, you turn back into your Old
[42:46] Testament here.
[42:50] In Judges 3:1,
[42:54] these are the nations which the Lord
[42:57] left.
[42:58] Isn't it amazing that God did not drive
[43:02] out all of the inhabitants from the land
[43:05] of Canaan, but he left some that you
[43:08] have to drive out, that you have to
[43:11] fight, that you have to have spiritual
[43:13] warfare with.
[43:16] Now, most of all would love to have a
[43:18] God who says, "Hey, just go clear the
[43:20] land, take them all out, and I don't
[43:24] have to do nothing. Just go possess it."
[43:25] Wouldn't that be nice?
[43:28] But that's, you know what Jesus said?
[43:30] Look, he says, "I send you as sheep
[43:33] among wolves."
[43:36] What kind of love is that of a shepherd?
[43:39] If you love me, why in the world do you
[43:41] put me among wolves?
[43:44] God tries to
[43:47] insulate you but not isolate you.
[43:50] The greatest place for your light to
[43:52] shine is in a place that's the most
[43:54] dark. Amen. So in Judges
[43:57] chapter 1,
[43:59] excuse me, chapter 3 verse one. Now
[44:02] these are the nations which the Lord
[44:03] left to prove Israel.
[44:08] by them even as many of Israel as had
[44:13] not known
[44:15] all the wars of Canaan. In other words,
[44:17] these guys have never been in a fight.
[44:20] They've never been in war. They've never
[44:22] been in a skirmish. These guys know
[44:24] nothing of war.
[44:29] So, watch what God tells them. only that
[44:31] the generations of the children of
[44:33] Israel might know
[44:36] to teach them war.
[44:43] At the least such as before knew nothing
[44:48] thereof.
[44:49] They don't know nothing about warfare.
[44:53] They've never fought a fight. Verse
[44:56] three, namely five lords of the
[44:58] Philistines
[44:59] and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians
[45:02] and the Hivites that dwelt in Mount
[45:05] Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon unto the
[45:10] entering in of Hmath,
[45:14] that they were to prove Israel by them,
[45:19] and to know whether they would hearken
[45:20] unto the commandments of the Lord, which
[45:23] he commanded their fathers by by the
[45:25] hand of Moses.
[45:28] And the children of Israel dwelt among
[45:30] the Canaanites,
[45:32] Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, and
[45:35] Hivites, and Jebusites. And they took
[45:39] their daughters to be their wives.
[45:42] Remember now I had showed you before he
[45:45] says whatever you do when you go into
[45:46] the land don't let your daughters
[45:50] be given to their sons nor your sons
[45:54] given to their daughters lest they take
[45:56] your children away from that which will
[45:59] be serving God.
[46:01] They took their daughters to their wives
[46:03] and gave their daughters to their sons
[46:05] and served their gods. And the children
[46:09] of Israel did evil in the sight of the
[46:10] Lord, and forget the Lord their God,
[46:14] and served Balum
[46:17] and the groves. Therefore, the anger of
[46:19] the Lord was hot against Israel, and he
[46:22] sold them under the hand of Kushan
[46:25] Risham,
[46:26] king of Mesopotamian, children of
[46:28] Israel, Sir Kushashrithium, eight years.
[46:32] May God bless the reading of his word. I
[46:35] want all of you to understand that we
[46:37] are in a time of war. Amen. Isn't it
[46:42] amazing that right now America,
[46:47] our president has said to go ahead and
[46:49] to bomb Iran?
[46:53] We're in the midst of wars and rumors of
[46:56] wars.
[46:57] There are many that are saying, "Oh my,
[46:59] oh my, we're going to go into a world
[47:01] war." And we might.
[47:06] This is a time of conflict. Amen.
[47:13] And so,
[47:15] you know, I'm not here to talk about it
[47:17] politically. I'm here to say we are in
[47:20] the time of wars and rumors of wars.
[47:24] So, let me show you a quote now as we go
[47:27] into our sermon this morning. In 1956,
[47:32] Brother Brandon preaches the
[47:33] resurrection of Jesus.
[47:36] Now, we have a great ministry out, the
[47:39] ministry of the forerunning
[47:41] of the coming of this ministry that's
[47:43] coming on now. The great climax is at
[47:47] hand. The great warfare between the
[47:50] devil and God is going on.
[47:53] The scene is being set for the final
[47:55] front lines. There's where I will be
[47:58] launching off the final front lines.
[48:03] He says the conflict is on. How many
[48:05] believe he's a prophet of God? And he
[48:08] said the final front lines are there.
[48:12] And he he says where the clash will come
[48:19] and God will reign and rule for the lamb
[48:21] was with them overcome them for he is
[48:23] the Lord of lord and king of kings and
[48:25] he will ride down every opposition.
[48:29] Now
[48:31] if we fail to study war and the effects
[48:36] of the war and of the spiritual warfare,
[48:41] you might just become a casualty of war
[48:44] and get taken out. Amen.
[48:48] Your kids,
[48:50] taken out.
[48:53] taken away from church, away from the
[48:56] message,
[48:58] away from
[49:00] the thing that God has sent to get you
[49:03] out of here.
[49:06] So it depends on how serious you take
[49:10] this warfare. Amen. If you take it
[49:12] lightly and say, "Ah, it's no big
[49:15] thing." We are in the worst of all ages.
[49:22] 1963, Brother Brenham said, "God hiding
[49:25] in simplicity. It's just like an army
[49:28] going to fight. We got spies in England.
[49:32] England's got spies here." And he goes
[49:33] on, he said, "It's a warfare. The
[49:36] greatest warfare is going on in a
[49:39] spiritual warfare."
[49:42] Now, I don't want you to focus on the
[49:45] natural warfare, but spiritual warfare.
[49:47] So you have to put your spiritual
[49:50] thinking cap on. Uh what do you mean
[49:53] brother Ron by spiritual warfare
[49:57] and how do we fight it?
[50:00] Now remember
[50:02] even as the scriptures said that our
[50:05] warfare is not after the flesh. It's not
[50:07] carnal
[50:09] but the pulling down of strongholds.
[50:13] Now let me just stop for a moment and
[50:15] talk about strongholds.
[50:18] Some of you
[50:20] who whether inadvertently
[50:23] or through naivity
[50:25] or through ignorance or for lack of
[50:29] teaching have opened up doorways in your
[50:33] life and you got a stronghold
[50:39] and you can't seem to overcome that and
[50:43] you want to overcome it but you can't.
[50:46] You try to come against it and you
[50:47] can't.
[50:49] And a prophet of God says if you open up
[50:52] a stronghold for the enemy to come in,
[50:55] no matter how much we pray for you, lay
[50:57] hands on you, anoint you with oil, he
[51:00] said that devil's got a right to stay
[51:02] there.
[51:04] So you have to know spiritual warfare.
[51:08] So a lot of times we think that the cure
[51:10] all for meetings is to have a prayer
[51:14] line.
[51:16] And a prayer line is to get everybody up
[51:17] here and you'll have the ministry and
[51:19] we'll all lay hands and guess what? The
[51:22] power of God and and God has given me
[51:24] the power to cast out devils and we
[51:27] believe in casting out devils.
[51:29] But what about the ministering in the
[51:31] word that goes forth that says you need
[51:33] to repent of the things that you're
[51:35] doing wrong that we have a right to cast
[51:38] that devil off because we can
[51:40] temporarily cast that devil off and
[51:42] he'll go out for a season, right? But
[51:45] he's upset.
[51:48] You have just evicted him.
[51:51] That's right. And what does he do? He
[51:54] goes out and gets several others strong
[51:56] against his big brothers. Hey, you know
[51:58] what he did? He kicked me out. He did.
[52:00] Well, let's go get him. And the Bible
[52:03] says in the house having not been
[52:05] filled.
[52:08] That spirit comes in with seven others.
[52:10] And the condition now of that person
[52:13] becomes worse than the first condition.
[52:17] Amen. And that that's what's wrong with
[52:19] many of those that have gone through a
[52:22] prayer line and had a spirit cast off
[52:25] them and a few weeks later they get
[52:27] caught right back in the same because
[52:29] they don't know spiritual warfare. They
[52:32] don't know how to withstand the enemy.
[52:35] They don't even know what to do. So
[52:37] therefore, they don't know this warfare.
[52:40] and they fall back into the same trap
[52:43] and it becomes worse. Then they get
[52:45] discouraged. Well, I thought I was
[52:48] delivered. I thought there was power. I
[52:51] I Well, I I I don't know. Maybe I don't
[52:54] even have confidence in the ministry
[52:55] anymore. And if I don't have confidence
[52:57] in the ministry, I don't have confidence
[52:59] in the prophet.
[53:01] And if I don't have confidence in the
[53:04] prophet, I don't have confidence in the
[53:05] word of God.
[53:08] Do you see where it just just keeps
[53:10] unfolding?
[53:12] And so they walk away all disillusioned.
[53:16] That's why we need ministries to teach
[53:20] spiritual warfare. That's right.
[53:25] Music,
[53:27] movies,
[53:30] magazines,
[53:32] websites. Come on, brother. internet,
[53:36] right? Fashion. Amen.
[53:40] Come on now, somebody say, "Preach it,
[53:42] brother." Preach it, brother. You see,
[53:44] my brother, my sister, I am not here.
[53:47] Amen. Just to
[53:50] please everyone. Paul said, "If I am a
[53:52] pleaser of man, I'm an enemy to God."
[53:56] So, I'm here to stir you up. And saints
[53:59] of God, sometimes it's gonna make you
[54:01] mad, right?
[54:04] Because it's gonna look like I'm picking
[54:10] and I'm after you.
[54:13] Well, that's what the enemy wants to
[54:16] tell you. Amen.
[54:20] Amen. Is that I'm after you, but no, I'm
[54:23] after the spirit that's after you. Amen.
[54:27] preaching. Amen. Amen. You may not see
[54:30] it.
[54:32] That's right. Have you ever
[54:35] seen some kind of a Hollywood movie
[54:37] where all of a sudden they're in a
[54:39] conflict or something and
[54:43] there's somebody coming up behind
[54:46] one of the good guys and the guy over
[54:48] here all of a sudden stands up, one of
[54:50] his his buddies, his comrade stands up
[54:53] and boom, shoots and he and a guy
[54:55] thought he was going to get shot
[54:57] himself.
[54:59] Oh man. where he throws the knife or he
[55:01] does something and ah that guy behind
[55:04] you he didn't see it there are things
[55:07] that are happening among the church now
[55:11] brother Brennham tells us and I think
[55:13] it's overemphasized
[55:16] by not saying the rest of the quote now
[55:19] when the true church now that means if
[55:21] there is a true church there is a false
[55:24] if the true church gets a true
[55:26] revelation
[55:28] that means there could be false
[55:29] revelation
[55:30] If the true church gets a true
[55:32] revelation of who she is, okay, say the
[55:36] rest of the quote, and begins to discern
[55:40] and withstand the two spirits within the
[55:43] framework of the church.
[55:46] You understand? Amen. And when you
[55:49] discern and withstand, then and only
[55:52] then will she, the bride, stand as an
[55:55] invincible army. Amen. Why? She knows
[55:59] her position. She's been trained.
[56:04] So that's why we go through these
[56:06] things.
[56:08] Now and every time in a war, whether
[56:10] it's the first world war, second world
[56:12] war, you have all kinds of small battles
[56:15] within a great war.
[56:18] Some are small skirmishes.
[56:21] Some are devastating battles where you
[56:25] lost the position you had. You had to
[56:27] fall back only to get some more fresh
[56:32] recruits and come in and retake the
[56:34] hill.
[56:37] Sometimes that happens.
[56:42] And some of these battles are game
[56:44] changers.
[56:47] We see whether it's in a physical
[56:49] battle, spiritual battle
[56:52] that sometimes
[56:54] some have such an effect that it's a
[56:56] gamecher at the time.
[57:01] But we have been studying about the
[57:03] Joshua commission and the thing that I
[57:05] love about Joshua
[57:07] is he was a great commander in battle.
[57:12] Every time that Israel's in the midst of
[57:14] a conflict, there's Joshua. Amen.
[57:18] He's leading in battle.
[57:21] And I think one of the most outstanding
[57:25] scriptures is Joshua now has the captain
[57:29] of the Lord of Hosts appear to him
[57:34] and Joshua draws his sword.
[57:39] And he is battle fatigued.
[57:42] He's been fighting so much
[57:45] that all of a sudden,
[57:48] are you for us or are you against us?
[57:51] Put away your sword, Joshua.
[57:54] I'm a captain of the Lord of hosts.
[57:57] Amen.
[58:01] Joshua, what a man of war.
[58:07] What a conflict.
[58:10] He was never afraid
[58:12] to go into war. And God said, "As I was
[58:16] with Moses, I'm going to be with you."
[58:18] And guess what? When you go into these
[58:20] battles,
[58:21] you're not going to lose a man.
[58:24] And if you start losing men, I want you
[58:26] to stop and check what's wrong. Amen.
[58:29] When we start losing battles, when we
[58:32] start losing families, when we start
[58:34] losing our children, when we start
[58:36] losing control of the church,
[58:38] something's wrong.
[58:40] man. Let's get back together. Let's have
[58:42] counsel. What's wrong? Yes. Amen.
[58:53] Brother Brennham says on putting on the
[58:54] whole armor of God. And you know in this
[58:57] warfare between nations, there's a great
[59:01] warfare going on beyond that. That's a
[59:04] warfare between God and Satan. A great
[59:07] warfare.
[59:09] That was the first warfare and it's
[59:12] still raging.
[59:15] But oh, I'm so glad it'll soon come to
[59:18] an end. Amen. Then it'll all be over.
[59:22] Now, until that time,
[59:25] until we are taken up, we're going to
[59:28] fight.
[59:30] Young people, young men, young sisters,
[59:33] you're going to fight.
[59:36] And you're going to you better know the
[59:38] conflict. Brother Bram says in the
[59:41] sermon, the contest,
[59:43] he says, "Look, when you go when two
[59:46] opponents are coming," he said, "you
[59:48] study your opponent. You learn how he
[59:51] fights. Does he lead with a jab, come
[59:54] with a right hook?" What does he do? You
[59:56] better know.
[59:58] Cuz he's got a knockout punch coming. If
[1:00:02] you're not careful, you're in here and
[1:00:04] you don't know, maybe you close your
[1:00:05] eyes. I don't know if you've ever seen
[1:00:08] somebody who's never had a fight and
[1:00:11] there's a conflict, whether it's on the
[1:00:13] school playground or whatever. He closes
[1:00:16] his eyes and goes into it like that.
[1:00:18] Now, the Bible says that we go not as
[1:00:21] one that punches the air.
[1:00:25] Keep your eyes open.
[1:00:28] If you're going to fight, fight to win.
[1:00:32] That's right. If you're going to fight,
[1:00:33] fight a good fight.
[1:00:36] Amen. Amen. Not Not one that the first
[1:00:39] time you get hit, well, okay, I give up.
[1:00:41] Stop. Stop. Stop. I'm on your side.
[1:00:45] Uhuh.
[1:00:47] No. And you better know how to take a
[1:00:50] punch. Amen. Yes. Remember, Brother
[1:00:52] Brennham was taught by a man that he
[1:00:55] called Six Second Smith. Yeah. Brother
[1:00:57] Brennham was learning how to be a
[1:00:59] professional boxer. He got in the ring
[1:01:01] with Six Second Smith and guess what?
[1:01:04] Like this knocking down. He said, "Man,
[1:01:06] why are you trying to knock my block
[1:01:09] off? Why are you hitting me so hard?" He
[1:01:12] said, "Bill, I'm training you cuz when
[1:01:14] you get in the ring, that other guy's
[1:01:17] going to try to take you out.
[1:01:24] So, it's good to have a sparring partner
[1:01:28] that is got power
[1:01:31] and got different moves so that you can
[1:01:34] learn.
[1:01:36] Okay? Because you're going to meet your
[1:01:38] opponent. You are going to meet him.
[1:01:40] You're going to meet him in the arena of
[1:01:42] your home, the arena of your marriage,
[1:01:46] in the arena of education, in the arena
[1:01:49] of fashion. All of the you're going to
[1:01:52] beat him.
[1:01:54] Yes. Amen.
[1:02:01] The warfare, like I said, started in
[1:02:03] heaven.
[1:02:07] Michael and Lucifer came into a great
[1:02:11] conflict.
[1:02:15] Lucifer was cast down
[1:02:18] came the god of this age.
[1:02:21] That's why now understand this world was
[1:02:24] given to him as a temporary domain.
[1:02:27] That's why Jesus said
[1:02:31] when he was tempted
[1:02:33] by Satan, he said, "My kingdom is not of
[1:02:35] this world." Amen.
[1:02:39] So this kingdom that we are in right now
[1:02:42] is Satan's kingdom. It's his Eden. And
[1:02:45] he's perfecting sin and his spiritual
[1:02:50] warfare. He's perfecting it
[1:02:53] to the best of his ability. And he's
[1:02:56] hiding and camouflaging himself
[1:03:01] in religion,
[1:03:04] in politics, in education,
[1:03:07] in fashion,
[1:03:09] in all of those areas, whether it's
[1:03:13] music,
[1:03:16] he's going to hide himself behind and
[1:03:19] said, "Well, it really doesn't matter
[1:03:23] how you dress,
[1:03:25] what you where
[1:03:28] if you dress like the world and act like
[1:03:31] the world,
[1:03:33] it really doesn't matter as long as your
[1:03:36] heart is right before God. I want you to
[1:03:40] understand that there is a way that
[1:03:41] seemth right unto man,
[1:03:44] that the end thereof is death.
[1:03:47] So, we don't want that deception to come
[1:03:49] upon us.
[1:03:56] Now, the true object of war is peace.
[1:04:01] That's why you have war. Because you got
[1:04:04] conflict. Let's have war. We win. H. You
[1:04:07] become our slaves. We take over your
[1:04:09] land. And now we have peace. For how
[1:04:13] long?
[1:04:14] Till another bad guy comes along.
[1:04:18] till a little Hittite that you didn't
[1:04:21] kill or a little parizzite that you
[1:04:25] said, "Oh, this sweet little guy." Yeah.
[1:04:28] Well, just let him raise up in your
[1:04:30] family.
[1:04:35] See what I'm saying?
[1:04:37] Now,
[1:04:39] in the sermon victory day,
[1:04:42] before I Well, let's go ahead and go
[1:04:44] that and then I'll I'll give you a
[1:04:46] little bit of what's going on right now.
[1:04:48] God has had great men out here standing
[1:04:52] at the front who's been able to capture
[1:04:55] by the spirit of God the thoughts of the
[1:04:57] people and throw it into the kingdom of
[1:05:00] God down there and come out victorious.
[1:05:04] We fight every day. We fight it every
[1:05:06] day. Every Christian fights a battle
[1:05:09] every day. Amen. Somebody say amen to
[1:05:12] that.
[1:05:17] going on constantly within us between
[1:05:21] right and wrong.
[1:05:24] Shall we receive it? Shall we do what
[1:05:27] shall we do? Shall we bow to the world?
[1:05:30] Shall we give up
[1:05:33] this thought that we got?
[1:05:36] Now understand that we are coming to a
[1:05:39] great battle. It's called the battle of
[1:05:41] Armageddon.
[1:05:44] That is not the final conflict.
[1:05:47] The next great battle
[1:05:51] is a battle in the valley of Megiddo
[1:05:56] which we call Armageddon.
[1:06:00] Now that will be
[1:06:03] the last conflict before the millennial
[1:06:06] reign.
[1:06:08] It's going to be a war. It's going to be
[1:06:11] a conflict. nuclear holocaust. It's
[1:06:13] going to be and we're going to walk out
[1:06:15] on the ashes of the wicked and we're
[1:06:17] going to come down here to the earth.
[1:06:18] We're going to live on the earth
[1:06:22] for a thousand years. And Satan is not
[1:06:25] done away with. He's only confined
[1:06:30] by circumstances.
[1:06:33] He can't come. He can't deceive. He
[1:06:35] can't fool. But he's not destroyed yet
[1:06:38] until the end of the thousand years. And
[1:06:41] at the end of the thousand years, he's
[1:06:44] going to rise up
[1:06:46] and they're going to have the one and
[1:06:48] greatest
[1:06:50] conflict that's ever happened,
[1:06:55] the battle of Gog and Magog.
[1:07:00] And that will be the mother of all
[1:07:02] battles.
[1:07:04] Amen.
[1:07:05] Now, I want you to understand the rest
[1:07:07] of these are the small skirmishes that
[1:07:09] we have here on this earth, but the
[1:07:12] whole thing centers around God and
[1:07:16] Satan.
[1:07:25] to understand that a prophet goes and
[1:07:28] makes a sacrifice unto the Lord because
[1:07:32] he's seeking God for an answer. We know
[1:07:35] that they would do that often before
[1:07:37] they go to battle. The prophet would go
[1:07:39] and seek the mind. Shall we go up? Shall
[1:07:41] we take the enemy? Is this the time?
[1:07:46] Because even if you know that you should
[1:07:49] go against the enemy, there always is a
[1:07:51] time
[1:07:52] of how and when. Timing is extremely
[1:07:56] important.
[1:07:58] So in 1 Samuel, I'll just show you some
[1:08:00] spiritual examples from the scripture.
[1:08:04] 1st Samuel 7:es
[1:08:07] 8-10.
[1:08:08] And the children of Israel said to
[1:08:10] Samuel, "Cease not to cry unto the Lord
[1:08:15] um our God for us, that he shall save us
[1:08:21] out of the hand of the Philistines." And
[1:08:23] Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered
[1:08:27] it for a burnt offering holy unto the
[1:08:29] Lord. And Samuel cried unto the Lord for
[1:08:32] Israel. And the Lord heard him. So
[1:08:34] here's a prophet saying, "Hey, we're
[1:08:37] going into battle, making a sacrifice."
[1:08:40] And as Samuel was offering up the burnt
[1:08:42] offering, the Philistines drew near to
[1:08:44] battle against Israel. But the Lord
[1:08:47] thundered
[1:08:48] with a great thunder on that day upon
[1:08:51] the Philistines and discomforted them
[1:08:54] and they were smitten before Israel. I
[1:08:57] want you to understand as they were
[1:08:59] making the sacrifice
[1:09:01] and here the Philistines are already
[1:09:04] getting ambushed and you know what God
[1:09:06] it thundered
[1:09:09] and it says the Bible says and they were
[1:09:11] discomforted. In other words, they were
[1:09:13] destroyed.
[1:09:14] Israel never even moved out of their
[1:09:16] camp.
[1:09:18] I want you to understand when God goes
[1:09:20] before you, there are times he'll
[1:09:23] destroy your enemy and you didn't even
[1:09:25] know that they were waiting an ambush
[1:09:27] for you.
[1:09:28] Thank you, Lord. There are times in your
[1:09:32] family life when something comes up and
[1:09:35] you weren't aware of it, but you're just
[1:09:37] going along. You're going to church.
[1:09:39] You're praying. You're reading your
[1:09:41] Bible. You're doing your best. And all
[1:09:43] of a sudden, you realize the enemy was
[1:09:46] destroyed. And you didn't even know he
[1:09:47] was there.
[1:09:50] Because it thundered.
[1:09:52] If it thundered in that day, it's got to
[1:09:54] thunder in this day. Amen. Amen. How
[1:09:57] many you know that those seven
[1:09:59] supernatural thunders,
[1:10:02] he says that's going to destroy the
[1:10:04] enemy and that's going to cause the
[1:10:06] rapturing faith for the catching away of
[1:10:09] the bride. Amen.
[1:10:11] So, we'll talk about that a little bit
[1:10:13] later.
[1:10:15] Many times in the scriptures, God comes
[1:10:17] on the scene and destroys the enemy
[1:10:20] without Israel even going to battle.
[1:10:24] Oh, I wish it was that simple all the
[1:10:26] time,
[1:10:27] but it's not. Unfortunately, we have to
[1:10:30] fight.
[1:10:32] Brother Bram said, I want all of you to
[1:10:34] understand God's not called you to a
[1:10:36] picnic. That's right. But he's called
[1:10:39] you to a battlefield.
[1:10:42] So, it depends on if you're prepared
[1:10:46] and if you went through boot camp.
[1:10:49] This is our training ground.
[1:10:51] Okay. This is our training ground. This
[1:10:54] is where your drill sergeant gets after
[1:10:56] you. You need to do better. Keep your
[1:10:58] head down. Don't let the enemy Don't do
[1:11:01] this. This, this. Yes. Amen. I I
[1:11:03] captain. Because out there is where you
[1:11:06] meet him. Amen.
[1:11:09] Sometimes right after church.
[1:11:13] Sometimes you're going to have a
[1:11:14] conflict with your kids in the car
[1:11:19] and you're going to wonder why.
[1:11:22] You realize spiritual warfare. And where
[1:11:26] in the world did your kid pick up this
[1:11:28] spirit? They never talked to me like
[1:11:30] this before. Who are they hanging
[1:11:31] around? There it is.
[1:11:34] Better be careful who you allow your
[1:11:37] kids to associate with.
[1:11:40] That's right.
[1:11:44] Next thing you know, they got a little
[1:11:46] hotty spirit. Well, who you been hanging
[1:11:48] around with?
[1:11:51] They pucker their little lips. You ain't
[1:11:53] You can't tell me what to do.
[1:11:57] Who you been hanging around with?
[1:12:01] Yeah. And then and then when mom and dad
[1:12:04] set limitations, you get all upset.
[1:12:09] He said, "No, you're not going to hang
[1:12:10] around those guys no more." Because the
[1:12:13] wrong kind of influence, you have to
[1:12:16] understand it's a spirit.
[1:12:18] Absolutely. Amen. Like that one brother
[1:12:21] that, you know, his wife said, "Honey, I
[1:12:24] want to go and be with all the sisters
[1:12:26] and and everything." Yeah, honey, that's
[1:12:29] fine. And uh after she goes and was with
[1:12:34] the sisters for a few days, she comes
[1:12:36] back and he says, "Honey, would you fix
[1:12:38] me something to drink?"
[1:12:40] Well, I've been with the sisters the
[1:12:42] last few days and I've learned a little
[1:12:43] something. Honey, you want a drink? You
[1:12:46] go fix it yourself. Your legs ain't
[1:12:47] broke.
[1:12:49] Okay.
[1:12:52] Honey, what's for dinner? I didn't I
[1:12:54] tell you. I kind of been with a few
[1:12:57] sisters here lately and they told me
[1:13:00] what they did with their husband and you
[1:13:02] know I'm kind of siding with them and so
[1:13:05] I've got you a little
[1:13:07] microwave thing that you can you know
[1:13:09] ready to eat dinner what what do they
[1:13:11] call them things you throw in the
[1:13:12] microwave and you can zap it
[1:13:17] because you know I'm not going to fix
[1:13:18] you a meal.
[1:13:20] Okay.
[1:13:22] Well, who you been talking to?
[1:13:27] Understand that little sweet heart of
[1:13:30] yours that said for better for worse,
[1:13:34] for rich or for poor, in sickness and in
[1:13:37] health, all of a sudden now it's coming
[1:13:40] against you. Then you wonder, h
[1:13:44] how did this happen? Because the enemy
[1:13:48] has been moving under the radar.
[1:13:52] I remember when brother John Laauo, you
[1:13:55] went with me and I think I took three or
[1:13:57] four other brothers. My next door
[1:13:59] neighbor was a squadron commander out
[1:14:01] here at Luke Air Force Base. And he
[1:14:04] said, "You guys want to do a hands-on
[1:14:06] with a F-16 jet and you want to fly the
[1:14:09] simulator?"
[1:14:10] Are you kidding me? I've always wanted
[1:14:12] to play war games.
[1:14:16] So we got there, we went through the we
[1:14:18] we we went through where the the pilots
[1:14:22] have their helmets and and all of their
[1:14:24] gear and everything and he was squadron
[1:14:26] commander.
[1:14:28] So he got to take us through all of this
[1:14:30] and we went out and sat down in a real
[1:14:33] F-16, opened the cockpit and really um
[1:14:37] you know I I was just amazed. I I should
[1:14:42] have been a pilot man. Yeah, I love this
[1:14:44] kind of stuff. Well, anyway, a little
[1:14:46] bit later, they went ahead and put us in
[1:14:48] the simulator. You remember that,
[1:14:49] Brother John? Wow. This is the real
[1:14:51] thing. This is what the real pilots have
[1:14:54] to go once a month, go in there, and
[1:14:56] they make scenarios
[1:14:59] of
[1:15:00] situations that the pilots's got to
[1:15:03] overcome the situation or you crash.
[1:15:06] Well, if you crash it in the simulator,
[1:15:08] they just press reset.
[1:15:11] In real life, you don't get to press
[1:15:13] reset. You die.
[1:15:16] Well, anyway, I get in here and he tells
[1:15:18] me, "Okay, let's go out here and we go."
[1:15:20] He said, "Let's go down the runway and
[1:15:22] everything and now put it here. Put the
[1:15:24] throttle forward. Put on the
[1:15:25] afterburner. Pull it straight up. Let's
[1:15:27] go to 40,000 ft and level off." Ah, this
[1:15:31] is neat because this is 360. This has
[1:15:33] got the sound. The only thing you're not
[1:15:35] feeling is the the GeForce. Everything
[1:15:39] else is real. I mean, this thing tilts
[1:15:41] and does all this stuff. Wow, this is
[1:15:43] the best video game I've ever played.
[1:15:46] And anyway, he said, "Okay." He says,
[1:15:48] "We're going to do a scenario." He's
[1:15:50] talking to me. I've got the headphones
[1:15:51] on. I'm hearing him. He said, "Okay,
[1:15:53] we've got a bogey about 65 miles." Gives
[1:15:57] me the heading. He said, "Let's do a
[1:15:59] flyby and do an identify."
[1:16:02] So, we turn and we head towards the
[1:16:04] bogey. shows only one blip.
[1:16:08] But as we come close enough to it and
[1:16:10] we've visually identified they got wing
[1:16:12] to wing tip to wing tip
[1:16:16] fighter jets of Russia
[1:16:20] and the moment you fly by them all of a
[1:16:23] sudden you see oh it's not one it's two
[1:16:25] or three and then all of a sudden one of
[1:16:28] them goes into a combat maneuver. Your
[1:16:31] radio says, "Warning, warning, combat
[1:16:34] maneuver." And so the the
[1:16:38] computer picks up. This guy's in combat
[1:16:40] maneuver.
[1:16:42] The squadron commander, my neighbor, he
[1:16:44] says, "Now pull back on your throttle.
[1:16:46] Pull or not throttle, but your stick."
[1:16:49] And he says, "Do a loop." He says, "We
[1:16:52] the MIG is doesn't have as tight a turn
[1:16:55] as the F-16, so come and go behind him."
[1:16:59] Well, it's first time I've ever flown an
[1:17:01] F-16. So, I just I pull back the stick
[1:17:05] and everything and you get the guy and
[1:17:07] then all of a sudden I get behind him
[1:17:08] and he's out here flying around and you
[1:17:11] know, hey, stop. Quit moving. Quit
[1:17:13] moving. I want to get you. You know, he
[1:17:14] says, "Do you want to use sticks or
[1:17:16] guns? You want to you want to use a a
[1:17:19] missile or guns?" And I said, "Let's use
[1:17:22] missiles."
[1:17:27] Right up the tailpipe. Boom.
[1:17:29] It says enemy destroyed. The other when
[1:17:32] he goes, "Let's go after him. Let's use
[1:17:34] guns this time." So I Anyway, it blew
[1:17:37] them all up. I I'm the victor. I I won.
[1:17:42] But that was just a game.
[1:17:46] I want you to understand
[1:17:49] that we are in real true combat. Amen.
[1:17:54] And there is no simulator down here that
[1:17:56] we can put you into. Now, here's a
[1:17:58] scenario with your kids and they go to
[1:18:01] school and the influences from school
[1:18:04] and music and the videos and the
[1:18:06] websites and Instagram and all of this
[1:18:09] and their love stories that they read
[1:18:11] and all of the stuff that they put into
[1:18:13] your mind and you wonder why they're
[1:18:15] battling
[1:18:16] and all of a sudden you're wondering why
[1:18:18] is this sweet little kid that you've
[1:18:20] raised up all of a sudden disobedient.
[1:18:27] Okay. And when they're little enough,
[1:18:29] yeah, you can control. Go to your room
[1:18:34] and they go to the room and pretty soon
[1:18:36] they start hating you because you're
[1:18:39] correcting them. I've seen you little
[1:18:42] children that get corrected that go to
[1:18:44] their room, I hate you. They go to their
[1:18:47] room with such resentment.
[1:18:50] Understand? Why do you correct your
[1:18:52] child?
[1:18:54] For their good,
[1:18:57] not because you want to beat on them,
[1:18:59] not because it's fun. I used to remember
[1:19:01] my mother says, "This is going to hurt
[1:19:04] me more than it does you." Whack, whack,
[1:19:06] whack. And I thought, "That's a joke.
[1:19:13] I'm going to beat this out of you."
[1:19:17] It didn't beat it out of me.
[1:19:20] They'll only made me sneakier.
[1:19:23] You're not going to find out. That's You
[1:19:25] see, the children are too smart.
[1:19:28] I'm going to restrict you from your
[1:19:30] internet. I'm going to take your cell
[1:19:33] phone. I'm going to block you. Do you
[1:19:36] know your kids are so much smarter? They
[1:19:39] come in there, unblock, go behind all of
[1:19:41] the stuff that you do, and they do their
[1:19:43] thing anyway.
[1:19:46] Yeah.
[1:19:47] And if you don't think they do,
[1:19:50] you're going to find out because they
[1:19:52] got kids that are so much smarter than
[1:19:55] them that tell them, "Well, if your mom
[1:19:57] and dad do this or something here, I'll
[1:19:59] give you this. Here's a password. You
[1:20:00] can get into this." And next thing you
[1:20:02] know, you really got a problem. Listen,
[1:20:04] the cell phone, the Bible says that we
[1:20:06] are not ignorant of the devil's devices.
[1:20:10] The cell phone
[1:20:12] is a loaded gun.
[1:20:17] It'll kill you.
[1:20:19] It may look innocent, but it opens a
[1:20:22] doorway. It creates strongholds
[1:20:26] in the young people's lives and even
[1:20:28] older.
[1:20:31] I've had young people come to me and
[1:20:33] say, "Brother Ron, why are you on our
[1:20:34] case?" Because we've got our older
[1:20:36] parents that still do gaming.
[1:20:40] Gaming.
[1:20:43] Gaming.
[1:20:45] What gaming?
[1:20:47] Parents locked themselves into the room,
[1:20:50] put the headphones on, got a microphone,
[1:20:52] next thing you know, they're part of
[1:20:53] some kind of gaming thing. Well, when I
[1:20:56] was a child, I thought as a child I
[1:20:58] acted.
[1:21:00] But when I became a man, I put away
[1:21:03] gaming.
[1:21:10] Act
[1:21:13] your IQ, not your shoe size.
[1:21:21] Ouch.
[1:21:25] I had one sister one time, her husband
[1:21:27] was so Oh, he just locked himself in his
[1:21:31] room. He just got in there and he he he
[1:21:34] megga dosed every evening on movies. And
[1:21:37] we're not talking PG. We're not talking
[1:21:39] where the red fern grows and old yeller
[1:21:42] and the love bug.
[1:21:45] He's watching everything that he wants
[1:21:46] to watch. R-rated, didn't matter. And
[1:21:50] she got so excited,
[1:21:53] so mad, so upset, she grabbed his laptop
[1:21:57] and right in front of him,
[1:22:00] she destroyed that Philistine.
[1:22:05] He was shocked. What? Have you gone
[1:22:08] crazy? What are you doing? She says, "I
[1:22:12] hate this thing. It's destroying our
[1:22:15] family, our marriage. Spend time with
[1:22:18] us."
[1:22:20] But then did that cause him to quit?
[1:22:23] What'd he do? Just went and bought
[1:22:25] another one.
[1:22:27] Okay. Then he locked his door. Then he
[1:22:30] deadbolted the door.
[1:22:35] God, help us understand we're in a
[1:22:37] spiritual warfare.
[1:22:40] And then you wonder why none of the kids
[1:22:41] want to serve God.
[1:22:44] Because if daddy's not in his position,
[1:22:47] okay, mama can try to hold the standard
[1:22:50] as much as she can, but if daddy
[1:22:53] is not in his position and doing what he
[1:22:56] ought to do, the whole family becomes
[1:22:59] dysfunctional.
[1:23:02] Now
[1:23:05] I want you to understand
[1:23:08] that with the opening of the seven seals
[1:23:10] and the book becomes open. It's a
[1:23:12] declaration of war
[1:23:15] because the first seal was a was a white
[1:23:18] horse rider just in symbol form. Here
[1:23:21] comes a white horse rider
[1:23:24] and he's got a bow and he's got no
[1:23:25] arrows and he's riding down through the
[1:23:27] ages. Brother Brennham, until the
[1:23:29] opening of the first seal, when an angel
[1:23:32] opened unto him the revelation of that
[1:23:34] first seal, he said, "What was it?" He
[1:23:37] says, "I've always thought it was Christ
[1:23:39] riding down through the ages."
[1:23:41] He said, "It's not." Who is it? It's the
[1:23:45] Antichrist. So, this Antichrist is
[1:23:47] riding. He's in a symbol form and he's
[1:23:50] writing and he starts in the Ephesian
[1:23:53] church age. And as he begins to write,
[1:23:55] he looks innocent. Yeah. It looks
[1:23:59] so deceiving. Yeah. And he's got a bow
[1:24:02] and no arrows.
[1:24:04] And here it is. He starts out as a
[1:24:07] saying. He goes to a creed to an
[1:24:09] unbinding way until he he like a python
[1:24:13] begins to tighten himself under. And now
[1:24:16] you have a nicicolein spirit that wants
[1:24:18] to divide and conquer. And the apostle
[1:24:20] Paul said as a white horse rider came in
[1:24:23] his symbol form here come in his reality
[1:24:26] form God bringing a message.
[1:24:31] Amen of the lion to combat the
[1:24:34] antichrist spirit because the apostle
[1:24:36] Paul said look after my departing shall
[1:24:39] come in grievous wolves not sparing the
[1:24:42] flock. I'm telling you I've not ceased
[1:24:44] to warn you day and night for three
[1:24:46] years.
[1:24:49] false prophets, false Christs.
[1:24:52] Oh, Ephesus, thou hast left thy first
[1:24:55] love. What happened in the first church
[1:24:58] age?
[1:25:01] It began to now break from its symbol
[1:25:04] form into its reality form. And the
[1:25:07] reality, it began to get sayings and
[1:25:09] creeds and dogmas.
[1:25:11] And the church starts following a
[1:25:13] certain way until it becomes an
[1:25:15] unbending way. It becomes a law. becomes
[1:25:19] something that the church teaches as
[1:25:21] doctrine and now they get taken off
[1:25:26] and a nicicoatan spirit comes in and it
[1:25:29] divides and conquers. Amen.
[1:25:32] Amen. That's what a nickelan spirit
[1:25:35] does. It divides and conquers. Now, as
[1:25:38] much as we want to look at the message
[1:25:41] right now as a whole around the world,
[1:25:44] the more you look at it
[1:25:49] in a broad spectrum
[1:25:52] around the world, you're seeing the
[1:25:54] enemy's doing everything that he can to
[1:25:56] divide us.
[1:25:58] Well, one believes he's coming on a
[1:26:00] white horse, another believes he's
[1:26:02] coming on a white cloud, and so they
[1:26:04] dysfellowship.
[1:26:06] I can't agree with you. You don't see it
[1:26:08] my way. Well, quit trying to make
[1:26:10] everybody see it your way. Let's say
[1:26:12] what the word says. Let's say what the
[1:26:14] prophet of God says. And we cannot
[1:26:17] disagree if we say what he says.
[1:26:22] Simple. Where we have the argument is
[1:26:25] your opinion of what he said and my
[1:26:28] opinion of what he said comes into
[1:26:30] conflict. Amen. Amen. So, we become like
[1:26:33] a an umpire in
[1:26:38] the baseball league and you're out
[1:26:42] or
[1:26:45] off the field.
[1:26:50] I've had some say, "Brother Ron, you're
[1:26:52] off. You're out. You're off.
[1:26:55] You're out of the game." Well,
[1:26:58] guess what? No man put me in the game.
[1:27:01] No man takes me out of the game.
[1:27:03] Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] Anyway,
[1:27:07] now watch this. In the first seal, now
[1:27:09] understand with the opening of the
[1:27:11] seals, it's a declaration of war.
[1:27:16] The white horse writer is now the
[1:27:18] mystery is pulled off of him. It's not
[1:27:20] Christ. It's Antichrist. What is he
[1:27:23] doing? He's deceiving the church. the
[1:27:27] first church age.
[1:27:30] He's already coming in there. He's
[1:27:32] bringing his false prophets. He's
[1:27:35] bringing the different ones to divide
[1:27:37] the church already. And by the time at
[1:27:40] 3:25 AD at Nioa Rome, he's already put
[1:27:44] his council of churches together,
[1:27:47] changed water baptism, and taken over as
[1:27:51] a ruler of the church.
[1:27:54] It declared war. Brother Bram says,
[1:27:57] "When a seal opens, it declares
[1:28:01] war."
[1:28:02] So Paul catches this. Watch this. Let's
[1:28:05] go to the first seal. Let me show you
[1:28:07] here. 1963, first seal.
[1:28:11] Then when the lamb took the book and
[1:28:13] broke the first seal, God spake, spoke
[1:28:15] from his eternal throne to say what the
[1:28:19] seal was to be revealed.
[1:28:22] And when it's placed before John, it was
[1:28:24] in a symbol. And when John saw it, it
[1:28:27] was still a mystery. Why? Just a white
[1:28:30] horse rider. He has no idea who it is.
[1:28:33] And what about this white horse rider?
[1:28:35] It's just a symbol. Amen.
[1:28:39] Why? It wasn't even revealed right then.
[1:28:41] It cannot be revealed until
[1:28:44] what he said here at the end time. But
[1:28:48] it become a symbol. See,
[1:28:50] when the thunder, remember, a loud
[1:28:53] clapping noise of thunder is the voice
[1:28:56] of God. Amen. That's what the Bible
[1:28:59] said. See, a clap of thunder. They
[1:29:01] thought it was a thunder, but it was
[1:29:03] God. He understood it for he it was
[1:29:06] revealed to him. See, it was a thunder.
[1:29:09] Notice the first seal. The first seal
[1:29:11] when it was opened in the symbol form,
[1:29:13] it thundered.
[1:29:15] Now, what about when it opened in its
[1:29:17] reality form? Listen to this. In its
[1:29:20] symbol form. Reality form.
[1:29:24] White horse, right? Or symbol form.
[1:29:27] Wow. Look at this. And I saw a white
[1:29:30] horse riding. And he had a bow and no
[1:29:33] arrows. That's symbol form.
[1:29:36] But in its reality when it broke forth
[1:29:40] and Paul catches the mystery here. He is
[1:29:43] a mystery of iniquity.
[1:29:46] Here he is coming as false prophets,
[1:29:49] false Christs
[1:29:51] coming to deceive the church, anointed
[1:29:55] ones at the end time.
[1:30:00] Okay? Now watch this in the book of
[1:30:01] Revelation. So now you take it from what
[1:30:03] the prophet said to take it back to
[1:30:06] scripture. Revelations
[1:30:08] 6 verse 1-5.
[1:30:11] And I saw when the lamb opened up one of
[1:30:13] the seals and I heard as it were the
[1:30:16] noise of thunder. What is thunder? It's
[1:30:18] a voice of God.
[1:30:20] So he heard a noise of thunder. And one
[1:30:23] of the four beasts say, "Come and see."
[1:30:26] And I saw and behold a white horse. He
[1:30:29] saw a symbol.
[1:30:32] And he that sat on him had a bow and a
[1:30:34] crown was given unto him. And he went
[1:30:36] forth conquering and to conquer. It's
[1:30:38] just a symbol for him. Verse four. And
[1:30:41] there went out another horse that was
[1:30:43] red and power was given to him that sat
[1:30:47] thereon to take peace from the earth.
[1:30:50] Verse five. And when he opened the third
[1:30:54] seal, I heard the third beast say, "Come
[1:30:56] and see." And behold, a black horse. And
[1:30:59] when he sat on him had a pair of
[1:31:01] balances in his hand until we know that
[1:31:04] there is the fourth horse rider. Who is
[1:31:07] it? It's a pale horse.
[1:31:11] He said that is when the antichrist
[1:31:14] becomes the beat him the beast himself
[1:31:16] and he's incarnate
[1:31:19] and he'll come into a man
[1:31:22] and he will rule as the beast. He said,
[1:31:27] "And death and hell follows him."
[1:31:30] Now understand
[1:31:32] that these
[1:31:36] symbols
[1:31:38] are coming into reality. Amen. Brother
[1:31:42] Brim talks about when this final or last
[1:31:46] pope comes out of the United States,
[1:31:49] he says, "Now, right now it's an image
[1:31:52] of the beast, but one day it'll have
[1:31:56] power to speak like a dragon."
[1:31:59] Do you understand the anti-semitism
[1:32:01] that's happening in the world today?
[1:32:03] Just because they're Jews, right?
[1:32:07] And it's happening mostly starts with
[1:32:09] our young people on our college campus.
[1:32:12] Why? Because it's a
[1:32:16] institute
[1:32:17] of knowledge.
[1:32:20] Comes from the tree of knowledge of good
[1:32:24] and evil.
[1:32:26] But now they're demonstrating. They
[1:32:29] don't know why. From
[1:32:31] what is it? The river to the sea. From
[1:32:37] the river to the sea, we're going to
[1:32:39] annihilate.
[1:32:41] We're going to kill every Jew
[1:32:44] because they're Jew.
[1:32:46] How would you like to be a Jew? You are
[1:32:49] one spiritually. Amen. That's right.
[1:32:54] I was at the Wells Fargo bank and the
[1:32:56] lady talking to me had a very heavy
[1:32:58] accent
[1:33:00] and I saw she had a Jewish
[1:33:06] starve David.
[1:33:09] I told her, I said, "Very nice symbol
[1:33:12] that you have there." I said, "I agree
[1:33:15] with Israel." She smiled real big
[1:33:19] because probably very few will say that.
[1:33:23] Okay, now understand right now we're
[1:33:26] kind of on the side of Israel and now
[1:33:30] we're bombing Iran. But there's coming a
[1:33:33] time
[1:33:35] There's coming a time, Brother Bram
[1:33:36] talks about America will turn her back
[1:33:39] on Israel. And when she does, she's
[1:33:42] done.
[1:33:44] So, right now, there's still an affinity
[1:33:46] with Israel. But there'll come a time
[1:33:48] when they quit playing their politics
[1:33:50] and and and you know what? It's going to
[1:33:52] be a a terrible time. But all of this is
[1:33:55] pointing up to a great escalation of
[1:33:58] conflict.
[1:34:00] And the same conflict that's coming
[1:34:01] against the Jews will come against the
[1:34:04] Christians because this is a
[1:34:06] pre-tribulation spirit. That's right.
[1:34:10] Brother Renham said in World War II,
[1:34:12] Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini.
[1:34:16] Our pre-tribulation spirits released.
[1:34:23] You should go to Avitz.
[1:34:25] Yes, you should go to the death camps.
[1:34:29] Yes, I've been there. I've walked
[1:34:32] through the gate that says, "Arbite
[1:34:34] makry,
[1:34:36] work makes freedom." And as soon as they
[1:34:39] got the Jews inside the camp and they
[1:34:41] closed the door, they said, "I'll tell
[1:34:42] you what, work does not make freedom.
[1:34:44] The only way you're going to get out of
[1:34:45] here is through the chimney of the
[1:34:47] crematorium."
[1:34:51] And there they killed over four million
[1:34:53] Jews.
[1:34:56] just because they're Jews.
[1:35:01] Not because they had done anything
[1:35:02] wrong,
[1:35:05] just because they're Jews.
[1:35:09] Now, watch this. Spirit is going to
[1:35:11] escalate because remember in the time of
[1:35:15] the tribulation, the three and a half
[1:35:17] years, bride goes up. Remember, bride
[1:35:20] goes up, the two spirits, Moses and
[1:35:23] Elijah, the two witnesses come down. And
[1:35:26] now there is a conflict. And the two
[1:35:29] witnesses are going to be for Israel.
[1:35:31] And they're called out of all of those
[1:35:34] in Israel, there is an elect group
[1:35:36] called the 144,000.
[1:35:39] 12,000 from every tribe. 12 tribes times
[1:35:43] 12. 144. What are they going to do to
[1:35:46] that 144,000?
[1:35:48] kill him.
[1:35:53] So, the spirit that's rising up right
[1:35:55] now will escalate
[1:35:58] till they annihilate 144,000 plus Moses
[1:36:02] and Elijah and they'll kill them. Let
[1:36:04] them lay their bodies in the streets.
[1:36:06] And the Bible says, "And all the world
[1:36:08] are eyes upon the two witnesses." Watch.
[1:36:11] It'll be on CNN, Fox News.
[1:36:16] If you see that, you've missed it.
[1:36:23] You're now foolish virgin.
[1:36:26] Wow. What a horrible time that will be.
[1:36:30] Well, brother Ron, are we going to see
[1:36:31] any uh are we going to see any
[1:36:34] tribulation before some of these time
[1:36:36] before the rapture of the church?
[1:36:38] Somebody asked me the other day, is
[1:36:39] Ellie gonna sink be before the the the
[1:36:42] rapture? I said, well, there's one
[1:36:44] quote. Brother Bram said, "I predict
[1:36:46] before the coming of the Lord, God's
[1:36:48] going to sink that place." Now, you take
[1:36:50] it whatever way you want to. We know at
[1:36:53] the first resurrection, there was a
[1:36:54] great earthquake.
[1:36:56] We know that every time God does
[1:36:59] something, earthquakes are also a sign
[1:37:01] of judgment. When brother Brand threw
[1:37:04] the stone up in the air, Sunset
[1:37:06] Mountain,
[1:37:08] thus sayeth the Lord, judgment is
[1:37:10] striking the West Coast. He said, "Watch
[1:37:12] that little tail or the little finger
[1:37:15] that raised up there in Alaska." He
[1:37:17] said, "Alaska almost sunk."
[1:37:20] Good Friday earthquake.
[1:37:23] All of these signs are signs of
[1:37:26] forewarning. He's coming.
[1:37:30] If you can read the spiritual signs,
[1:37:33] then you can understand God's giving
[1:37:36] warning before judgment.
[1:37:39] Now
[1:37:42] John only saw the symbol breaking forth
[1:37:48] and it thundered. Then the seventh angel
[1:37:50] in our age he sees it break in its
[1:37:53] reality form and it thundered also.
[1:37:58] What is the seven thunders? The
[1:37:59] mysteries of God being made known.
[1:38:03] And then we see it in its reality form.
[1:38:06] What may look as innocent?
[1:38:10] Brother Brennham said, "Why am I against
[1:38:14] organized religion?
[1:38:16] It is not the people I am against
[1:38:20] because there's good people in every
[1:38:22] organization, every denomination, good
[1:38:24] people."
[1:38:26] But he says it's the system.
[1:38:30] Now the system itself, the Bible says
[1:38:32] all those whose names are not written in
[1:38:35] the lamb's book of life shall be
[1:38:37] deceived.
[1:38:39] So the deception is religion.
[1:38:44] He's bringing the world council of
[1:38:45] churches, getting them all together to
[1:38:48] bring forth a great climactic issue.
[1:38:59] The subject came up the other day and I
[1:39:01] discussed this with some about
[1:39:06] uh I showed
[1:39:09] the video clip of a girl that had her
[1:39:11] hair cut like mine. She was singing a
[1:39:13] song that was a nice
[1:39:17] wonderful sounding song. But I said,
[1:39:20] "What's wrong with the picture?
[1:39:24] what's wrong with the picture?
[1:39:27] And then it was told to me, well, we
[1:39:30] have a lot of songs that we sing
[1:39:33] within our church here. I said, if you
[1:39:36] knew who it was that wrote the song,
[1:39:38] you'd probably ne never understand.
[1:39:40] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop.
[1:39:43] I'm not here looking at everybody and
[1:39:46] who this and that. Like, the girl that
[1:39:49] was singing the song was not the one who
[1:39:50] wrote it. I googled it. Who wrote the
[1:39:54] song Oceans? I think that's the name of
[1:39:56] it. Who who wrote it? Well, three guys.
[1:39:59] Okay. Two guys in particular. And then
[1:40:01] one guy helped him put it to music.
[1:40:04] But the girl that was singing it is the
[1:40:06] head of
[1:40:08] the she is the swift tailor of Christian
[1:40:13] rock music.
[1:40:15] Okay.
[1:40:18] I am not condemning the person
[1:40:22] and all of those that are with her that
[1:40:25] are worshiping. Now Jesus said those
[1:40:28] that worship me must worship me in what?
[1:40:33] So you can have spirit and no truth.
[1:40:37] And God says I rejected
[1:40:39] in vain.
[1:40:41] Do they worship me teaching for doctrine
[1:40:45] the commandments of men? So, it's false
[1:40:47] worship, isn't it? Now, that offends
[1:40:50] some people. Did not Cain get offended
[1:40:54] when God rejected his worship and said,
[1:40:57] "Won't receive it."
[1:41:00] Yeah. He got wroth with God. Even God
[1:41:03] said, "Well, why is your countenance
[1:41:05] fallen?" Yeah. Well, you received Abel's
[1:41:08] and not mine. I gave it in sincerity. In
[1:41:11] fact, mine's pretty. Mine's beautiful. I
[1:41:14] brought of the fruit of the land, not
[1:41:16] realizing he was giving back part of
[1:41:20] that which is already cursed.
[1:41:23] My
[1:41:25] so please don't misunderstand me. I'm
[1:41:29] not here to say, "Okay, brother Robert,
[1:41:31] I want to know every song that we sing.
[1:41:34] Who wrote it? Do they have long hair?
[1:41:37] Are they perverts?
[1:41:39] Are they whatever?" Next thing we'll
[1:41:42] only sing and
[1:41:44] I don't even know all the people who
[1:41:47] wrote songs that we sing from our song
[1:41:50] book like the only belief song book.
[1:41:55] Brother Brennham said as an example some
[1:41:58] people they write songs under great
[1:42:00] inspiration and he said and he says
[1:42:02] because they write under inspiration
[1:42:04] when the inspiration's not there they
[1:42:06] want to commit suicide.
[1:42:13] So it I'm not here to judge and please
[1:42:17] don't ever think that brother Ron is
[1:42:19] trying to judge others. I'm just saying
[1:42:21] what's wrong with the picture.
[1:42:24] Okay? Because there is no projection to
[1:42:28] those people. You need to get right with
[1:42:30] God.
[1:42:32] And they all want to serve a God that we
[1:42:35] love.
[1:42:37] And it's our love towards God. But if
[1:42:40] you love me, Jesus said, you keep my
[1:42:43] commandments.
[1:42:46] And most of them are not.
[1:42:50] Okay, I don't want to belabor the point.
[1:42:53] So there's two prophets in the Old
[1:42:55] Testament that the Bible says they are
[1:42:57] prophets of war.
[1:43:00] One is Jeremiah, the other is Joel. Let
[1:43:03] me show you. In Joel 6 verse4,
[1:43:07] prepare ye war against her.
[1:43:11] Arise, let us go up at noon. Woe unto
[1:43:14] us, for the day goeth away, for the
[1:43:17] shadows of the evening are stretched
[1:43:19] out. Prepare ye war against her. Joel
[1:43:25] 3:9,
[1:43:27] proclaim ye this among the Gentiles.
[1:43:30] Prepare war.
[1:43:33] Wake up the mighty men.
[1:43:37] Let all of the men of war draw near.
[1:43:41] Let them come up.
[1:43:43] See, the men that are called to battle
[1:43:45] are actually called mighty men of valor.
[1:43:47] Did you know that? They're called mighty
[1:43:49] men of war.
[1:43:54] They are considered consecrated warriors
[1:43:57] before the Lord.
[1:44:01] Did you know that Muslim jihadists?
[1:44:10] They proclaim holy jihad,
[1:44:13] holy war against America,
[1:44:19] against Israel, death to America. Burn
[1:44:23] the flag.
[1:44:28] holy jihad.
[1:44:31] And you know what they do? They put on
[1:44:34] their holy shirts. They put on their
[1:44:36] certain hats. They bless their weapons.
[1:44:41] And they sing chance before they go to
[1:44:43] war.
[1:44:45] And they are told,
[1:44:47] I forget
[1:44:49] that if you kill
[1:44:51] an unconverted
[1:44:54] one who is against Islam and Muhammad
[1:44:58] that you immediately get a you get to go
[1:45:00] to heaven and you get 60 vestal virgins
[1:45:04] or 40, I forget what it is. So these
[1:45:07] guys run into war, give their life, what
[1:45:10] a disappointment when they get there.
[1:45:19] But it's a holy war to them.
[1:45:22] That's why they give their life freely.
[1:45:28] Uh Israel before they directly engaged
[1:45:33] in war, they would bring out the ark of
[1:45:35] God to be brought out amongst them.
[1:45:39] Understand that. Let's type it out. that
[1:45:42] the word of God had to be brought out in
[1:45:44] this age before we go to spiritual war
[1:45:48] in the end time before the seals are
[1:45:51] broke.
[1:45:53] Brother Bram says let's go into and he
[1:45:55] begins to show us what they did. So let
[1:45:58] me show you into sermon paradox 1963.
[1:46:02] That's look at the army
[1:46:05] and when they sing the songs and play
[1:46:07] the music. Do you know
[1:46:10] the approach to war? The army of God.
[1:46:13] It's first by music. Brother Robert, why
[1:46:17] do we sing? Create an atmosphere. Create
[1:46:20] an atmosphere.
[1:46:22] If you're in the battle for the Lord and
[1:46:25] ride, keep on the firing line. Not me.
[1:46:30] I'd rather hide behind the rock and be
[1:46:32] out of sight.
[1:46:39] Got to be kidding me. Why do we sing
[1:46:41] these songs? Look at what brother
[1:46:42] Brenham said. The singers went before
[1:46:44] the ark rejoicing and singing. Then come
[1:46:47] the ark and then the battle.
[1:46:51] That's right. So that's a right
[1:46:53] approach. In 1st Samuel chapter 4, let
[1:46:55] me show you what they did with Israel.
[1:46:57] And so the people sent to Shiloh that
[1:47:00] they might bring from Fence the ark of
[1:47:03] the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which
[1:47:05] dwelleth between the cherubams. And the
[1:47:07] two sons of Eli, Hoffen and Phineas,
[1:47:10] were there with the ark of the covenant
[1:47:13] of God. And when the ark of the covenant
[1:47:16] of the Lord came into the camp, all
[1:47:19] Israel shouted with a great shout, so
[1:47:21] that the earth rang again. And when the
[1:47:23] Philistines heard the noise of the
[1:47:25] shout, they said, "What meanth the noise
[1:47:28] of this great shout in the camp of the
[1:47:30] Hebrews,
[1:47:31] and they understood that the ark of the
[1:47:33] Lord came was come into the camp." I
[1:47:37] wish that in our song service,
[1:47:40] we had enough of the shout of the king
[1:47:43] is in the camp that it would be noised
[1:47:46] abroad.
[1:47:49] those message believers, my goodness,
[1:47:52] they get so excited
[1:47:55] about what they believe
[1:47:58] that they don't just sit in there.
[1:48:02] Well, you know, don't don't make me get
[1:48:04] excited. Just let me sit here.
[1:48:08] Huh? No. Get excited. Clap your hands.
[1:48:14] Do something.
[1:48:16] Right.
[1:48:20] Any of you ever watch the archives films
[1:48:23] of the church? You ever see yourself?
[1:48:27] Some of you.
[1:48:32] Some of you the people are clapping all
[1:48:34] around you and you're
[1:48:37] What's wrong?
[1:48:40] What's wrong? That's the only instrument
[1:48:41] you bring with you everywhere. Clap your
[1:48:44] hands all ye people. shouting to God
[1:48:47] with the
[1:48:51] But I guess it's like that song says, I
[1:48:55] command my hands to praise the Lord.
[1:48:59] I command my feet to praise the Lord. I
[1:49:04] command my body to praise. I command it
[1:49:09] even when I don't feel like it and I'm
[1:49:13] not in the mood
[1:49:16] and I'd rather not.
[1:49:18] I command my hands.
[1:49:21] I command my feet.
[1:49:24] I command my body. Why? I'm in control
[1:49:26] of this. My body's not in control of me.
[1:49:29] I'm in control of my body. That's right.
[1:49:32] Amen.
[1:49:35] Preach it, brother.
[1:49:38] Some of you I don't think are because we
[1:49:40] sing it and you don't come in. You do.
[1:49:52] So,
[1:49:56] and the Philistines were afraid for they
[1:49:58] said, "God is coming to the camp." And
[1:50:01] they said, "Woe unto us, for there hath
[1:50:04] not been such a thing hereto for. Woe
[1:50:08] unto us, who shall deliver us out of the
[1:50:10] hand of these mighty gods?"
[1:50:14] Are you not gods?
[1:50:17] These are the gods that smokeote the
[1:50:19] Egyptians
[1:50:21] with all the plagues in the wilderness.
[1:50:23] These are the gods.
[1:50:26] Come have breakfast with the table of
[1:50:28] the gods on Monday morning.
[1:50:31] We talk about this because you know what
[1:50:34] really Jesus said, "Are you not God's?"
[1:50:39] If God were to have a son, if God were
[1:50:41] to have a people, what would they be
[1:50:43] like?
[1:50:45] They would be godlike.
[1:50:50] Are you not gods?
[1:50:53] Whom the word of the Lord comes to?
[1:50:56] So if God sends a word of the Lord in
[1:50:58] this age, what we call the message of
[1:51:01] the hour, and the Bible says
[1:51:04] that the testimony of Jesus Christ is
[1:51:08] the spirit of prophecy.
[1:51:12] So if God sends a prophetic word in this
[1:51:14] day, there's only one group of people
[1:51:16] that will receive it. Those who have the
[1:51:20] testimony of Jesus Christ,
[1:51:24] they'll receive it. Why? They can see
[1:51:26] it.
[1:51:28] That's their testimony. Listen, I want
[1:51:30] all of you to understand.
[1:51:33] My testimony is this message.
[1:51:38] Before it, I had knowledge of religion
[1:51:42] of this one and of that one and this
[1:51:44] preacher and that preacher. And I really
[1:51:46] didn't know what was what. And I
[1:51:48] thought, well,
[1:51:50] I don't know. I don't know what is truth
[1:51:52] until
[1:51:54] I heard this message. Amen. And when I
[1:51:57] heard this message,
[1:52:00] may I say this? It became my testimony.
[1:52:03] So everything that I look at throughout
[1:52:06] the world, I look at it through
[1:52:08] prophetic eyes.
[1:52:12] Do you understand that? Brother Bram
[1:52:14] says, "Now what would cause a woman to
[1:52:17] cut her hair?
[1:52:21] Well, I just got split ends.
[1:52:25] I I It's unhealthy. So, chop chop. I'll
[1:52:29] cut it off because I want it to be
[1:52:31] healthy. Brother Brennham now through
[1:52:34] prophetic eyes says a woman that cuts
[1:52:37] her hair, he says, is a dishonorable
[1:52:41] woman.
[1:52:43] Do you know he probably uses that
[1:52:45] doctrinal teaching in almost every
[1:52:48] sermon? A woman that cuts her hair, it
[1:52:52] looks innocent, doesn't it?
[1:52:55] But he said it becomes a He says when a
[1:52:58] woman cuts her hair, she takes unto her
[1:53:02] a ungodly,
[1:53:05] unclean
[1:53:07] spirit that leads her off into deception
[1:53:11] because she dishonors her head. That's
[1:53:13] right. And her head is who?
[1:53:16] Christ. Right? So I look at that now
[1:53:21] through prophetic eyes
[1:53:24] and I say what he said. Why? Because a
[1:53:26] prophet is likened unto a seer. He's the
[1:53:29] eyes to the body.
[1:53:32] So don't get mad at me. I'm just telling
[1:53:34] you what he saw. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:40] When brother Brennan was introduced by a
[1:53:44] well-known minister and his wife, he
[1:53:47] said, "I want you to meet my wife cuz
[1:53:49] she's a saint."
[1:53:51] He says, "Here she came, her cut hair,
[1:53:55] painted nails, you know, all the things
[1:53:58] that he said."
[1:54:00] And he says, "My, I looked at her and he
[1:54:04] says, "She looks more like a hint than a
[1:54:07] saint."
[1:54:09] Amen. That sounds hard, doesn't it? I'm
[1:54:12] sorry. It does.
[1:54:16] If we're not careful, we take the letter
[1:54:18] of this message and we judge everyone
[1:54:22] who perhaps has never heard.
[1:54:28] I remember one time
[1:54:32] I was over in I think it was over in
[1:54:35] Ireland.
[1:54:37] I was over there in Ireland and I'd
[1:54:39] asked by one of the friends of Steven
[1:54:43] McNeely
[1:54:45] and just a small group of young boys,
[1:54:48] couple girls. The guys had dog collars
[1:54:51] with spikes on them,
[1:54:54] chains around their neck, all kinds of
[1:54:56] stuff. And I'm thinking, these guys call
[1:54:58] themselves message believers. Well, I'm
[1:55:00] going to throw some stuff out here.
[1:55:03] I'm going to see if they can handle it.
[1:55:05] I began to talk about I said, "Hey,
[1:55:07] listen. If you're a real message
[1:55:08] believer, why don't you apply the word
[1:55:11] of God?" I said, "Why do you look like
[1:55:12] the world, act like the world? The love
[1:55:14] of God's not even in you."
[1:55:17] And while I was preaching,
[1:55:21] they took off their dog collars
[1:55:25] and they came to me after service and
[1:55:26] said, "Nobody told us."
[1:55:30] Nobody. No. They just said, "Well, God
[1:55:33] is love and he just accept." But you
[1:55:35] see, when you come out of the world,
[1:55:37] it's time to get the world out of you.
[1:55:40] Amen.
[1:55:43] And I remember I think I was in England,
[1:55:46] might have been in Wales one time and I
[1:55:49] was just maybe 30, 40 people and there
[1:55:52] was a sister right like you, brother
[1:55:55] David, just just somebody real close to
[1:55:57] me and she's sitting there got short
[1:55:58] hair, big big hoop earrings, lipstick on
[1:56:01] and everything and I'm thinking, whoa,
[1:56:03] where did she come from?
[1:56:07] And she's sitting there and rejoicing
[1:56:09] and having a great time. Well,
[1:56:13] honestly, I didn't go after
[1:56:16] the makeup.
[1:56:20] I didn't condemn her.
[1:56:24] I just began to speak truth. Amen. My
[1:56:27] goodness. She came to me after service.
[1:56:29] She said, "Pastor,
[1:56:32] no one's ever told me this.
[1:56:34] I'm ashamed of all this stuff. I want
[1:56:37] God to cleanse me.
[1:56:40] And she says, "Thank you for telling me
[1:56:42] truth.
[1:56:44] See, I don't want to I don't want to
[1:56:45] cover it. I don't I don't want to
[1:56:48] hybridize it. I want to tell you truth.
[1:56:52] Even if you get mad at me
[1:56:57] because sometimes I'm going to get some
[1:56:59] of you mad at me
[1:57:01] because if I don't, I'm not really
[1:57:03] preaching the gospel." That's right.
[1:57:05] Because there'll be sometimes, but I
[1:57:07] don't want to do it with an offensive
[1:57:08] spirit because I can come in here and
[1:57:11] with the boxing gloves on and come on,
[1:57:13] right? And and I'll tell you what, and
[1:57:15] you're going to you're going to conform
[1:57:17] to the Bible says, "Be not conformed.
[1:57:21] Be transformed." So, what I do
[1:57:25] is I try to say, "God, soften my spirit.
[1:57:29] Don't let the people think that I'm
[1:57:31] coming after them.
[1:57:33] But it's a spirit trying to take them
[1:57:35] out.
[1:57:37] You may think that the little trimming
[1:57:38] of hair, it's innocent. It's not. It's a
[1:57:42] spirit.
[1:57:44] You may think that the form fitting
[1:57:46] dresses and the form fitting clothes
[1:57:48] that some of you sisters wear that is
[1:57:51] just the fashion of the day. It's not.
[1:57:53] It's a spirit.
[1:57:57] You young boys may think, well, it's
[1:57:59] just the fashion of the day where pants
[1:58:01] look like they've been sprayed on and
[1:58:04] your hair a little bit more cut like the
[1:58:07] guys of the world. You know, guys can
[1:58:09] fit in a whole lot easier than the girls
[1:58:11] can. Isn't that true, girls? Yeah. Yeah.
[1:58:14] Come on, tell them. You guys got it
[1:58:16] easy.
[1:58:19] They do because they can fit in. They
[1:58:22] can wear their Adidas and their Nike and
[1:58:24] their little you know, skinny jeans and
[1:58:29] Yeah. But the girls
[1:58:33] when it's a little bit easier to
[1:58:36] identify the guys and I can kind of fit
[1:58:38] in.
[1:58:41] God never wanted Israel to fit in. Amen.
[1:58:44] That's right. That's right. I want a man
[1:58:47] to look like a man and a woman to look
[1:58:48] like a woman.
[1:58:50] That's why it's an abomination
[1:58:52] for a woman to wear clothes pertaining
[1:58:55] to a man.
[1:58:57] It's an abomination.
[1:59:00] It's a horrible thing. God says, "I I I
[1:59:03] hate it. It's horrible. And those that
[1:59:06] are abominable shall not enter into the
[1:59:09] kingdom of God." Amen.
[1:59:12] Thank God that we've had a prophet come
[1:59:14] and tell us
[1:59:17] through God's eyes. Amen.
[1:59:21] He looked at the church of Laosa
[1:59:23] musicians have you come? He looked at
[1:59:26] the church of Laosa.
[1:59:32] He says, "You're poor,
[1:59:34] miserable,
[1:59:36] blind,
[1:59:38] wretched, and naked, and knoweth it
[1:59:43] not."
[1:59:45] It took a prophet to let us know.
[1:59:49] took a prophet to tell us what was
[1:59:52] truth.
[1:59:58] I had some more scriptures to show you
[2:00:00] how the armies of Israel would go and
[2:00:03] how that they would praise the Lord and
[2:00:05] everything. And we know according to
[2:00:07] history, even when the Roman armies came
[2:00:10] down off the hill, you know what they
[2:00:11] did? They blew the trumpets
[2:00:17] and thousands of men came and hear
[2:00:19] trumpets and and drums
[2:00:24] and it scared the enemy
[2:00:29] when the I the Irish
[2:00:32] No, I guess it's Scottish bag pipes.
[2:00:34] Scottish. They're bag pipes, right?
[2:00:37] Scotland,
[2:00:38] not Irish.
[2:00:40] Ireland.
[2:00:42] So the Scottish, they also had the bag
[2:00:45] pipes coming before them. Do you know
[2:00:48] even before our sporting events,
[2:00:51] if you have a football team, you got the
[2:00:53] marching band, here it comes ASU
[2:00:56] marching band
[2:01:00] and the guy out here like this, you
[2:01:03] know, fight, fight, fight. What are they
[2:01:06] doing preparing? And they're getting
[2:01:07] everybody all psyched up, right? Win
[2:01:11] win. Sundevils win,
[2:01:16] right? It happens. You ever guys seen uh
[2:01:20] New Zealand All Blacks?
[2:01:23] They come out there with their hucka
[2:01:29] like this. What are they doing? They're
[2:01:30] preparing for battle.
[2:01:34] What do we do when we come to church and
[2:01:36] we sing?
[2:01:39] We sing with everything that's in us.
[2:01:42] Why? We're going to war.
[2:01:46] The word of the Lord is coming to you.
[2:01:50] The American Indians before they went to
[2:01:53] war, what would they do?
[2:01:58] Dance around. Get war paint. They dance
[2:02:01] all night. get all frenzied up.
[2:02:07] They did that to go prepare for war.
[2:02:14] Okay, I'm going to leave the last couple
[2:02:17] things for my next time talking about
[2:02:19] when you're called to war by a trumpet
[2:02:23] and when the trumpet sounds. And we know
[2:02:26] Israel had two trumpets,
[2:02:28] two silver trumpets.
[2:02:31] One for the calling of the camp together
[2:02:35] and another, the second trump,
[2:02:38] the moving of the camp.
[2:02:41] Now, we've had a trumpet
[2:02:43] in the days of the voice
[2:02:46] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[2:02:48] to sound. Brother Brandham says the
[2:02:50] Greek word sound means to blast forth a
[2:02:54] gospel trumpet.
[2:02:58] You know what's gathered us together?
[2:03:01] The trumpet of Malachi 4. Revelations
[2:03:05] 10:7. I heard the shout. I heard the
[2:03:08] trumpet. And it had urgency. It had come
[2:03:11] together.
[2:03:14] Why? It's urgency. There's war going on.
[2:03:17] Get ready.
[2:03:19] He's coming and a climactic battle is
[2:03:22] about ready to take place and it's a
[2:03:25] spiritual conflict. And the moment that
[2:03:28] any of you forget this, you'll be the
[2:03:30] next casualty.
[2:03:34] I don't want you to be a casualty.
[2:03:38] [Music]
[2:03:40] I don't want you to be a casualty.
[2:03:43] I want you to be alive and remain
[2:03:47] at the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[2:03:50] Amen.
[2:03:51] God bless you this morning.
[2:04:03] I have found a place
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:07] I can call my understanding this
[2:04:10] morning.
[2:04:12] here in your embrace
[2:04:15] where your mercy overflows.
[2:04:21] It's here that all my doubts tears just
[2:04:26] melt away.
[2:04:29] I lay my burden down and I look upon
[2:04:35] your face.
[2:04:38] You are my refuge.
[2:04:43] You're my sanuary
[2:04:48] when I feel afraid.
[2:04:52] You're my hiding place. You are my
[2:04:56] refuge.
[2:05:00] And when the storm
[2:05:02] is raing
[2:05:05] underneath your wings,
[2:05:09] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[2:05:14] Now, before we sing the next Sandy for
[2:05:17] the baptismal that we have today, would
[2:05:20] you go and help the sister get ready?
[2:05:23] Whatever. Make sure she's got the gown.
[2:05:25] We have a baptismal after service.
[2:05:29] Those of you that wish to watch the
[2:05:31] baptism,
[2:05:33] that's fine. I want you to come be with
[2:05:35] us. And uh so I'll turn it over to
[2:05:39] brother Robert. I'll go and get ready.
[2:05:42] So God bless you. My refuge.
[2:05:47] You're my sanuary.
[2:05:50] [Music]
[2:05:52] When I feel afraid,
[2:05:56] you're my hiding place. You are my
[2:06:00] refuge.
[2:06:03] You're my sorrow.
[2:06:06] It's raing.
[2:06:09] Underneath your wings,
[2:06:13] I rejoice.
[2:06:15] Sing, you are my If he's your refuge
[2:06:18] this morning, sing the chorus again. And
[2:06:20] you are my refuge.
[2:06:24] You're my sanctuary.
[2:06:30] If I feel afraid, you're that hiding
[2:06:33] place. My hiding place. You are my
[2:06:38] refuge.
[2:06:41] And when the storm
[2:06:44] is raing
[2:06:46] underneath your wings,
[2:06:50] I rejoice in
[2:06:54] you are my refuge. Before we go, Lord,
[2:06:59] prepare
[2:07:02] me
[2:07:04] to be a sanctuary.

[2:07:12] pure

[2:07:53] a living dwelling place where he can
[2:07:55] dwell. Sanctuary,
