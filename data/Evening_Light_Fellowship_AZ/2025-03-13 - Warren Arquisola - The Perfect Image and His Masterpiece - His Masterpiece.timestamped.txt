[38:12] them male and female
[38:16] created he them amen Psalms chapter
[38:22] 139 verse4
[38:31] I will praise thee for I am
[38:35] fearfully and wonderfully made amen
[38:39] that's God how he created us
[38:43] fearfully wonderfully
[38:45] made marvelous are thy
[38:50] works and that's my soul knowth right
[38:55] well may the Lord are the blessings of
[38:59] the reading of his word you may be
[39:01] seated
[39:05] amen thank you for the opportunity
[39:08] brother
[39:09] Ron
[39:21] amen Pope Julius
[39:25] II was commissioned Michel
[39:28] Angelo to build to build his tomb in
[39:36] 1505 and it was finally completed in
[39:41] 1545 40
[39:43] years in the
[39:46] making but then he didn't
[39:49] see his own tomb because he died in 1513
[39:58] so but then Michel
[40:02] Angelo built this the the the statue of
[40:06] Moses it was 12T and 3 in I will show
[40:11] you the picture brother Brenham saw this
[40:14] from the Forest Lawn in California but
[40:17] that is the
[40:18] original in the uh
[40:22] Rome
[40:24] now that's the perfect image
[40:28] of
[40:29] Moses so brother Branham was
[40:33] preaching about this
[40:36] image that when Michel Angelo
[40:40] Angelo how do you pronounce it Angelo
[40:43] saw the Perfection of
[40:47] Moses he hammered the knee of Moses uh
[40:51] can you show that brother so
[40:54] that I cannot really see it but there
[40:57] there was a according to that uh
[41:00] historian there was a a a a flaw on that
[41:05] knee of
[41:08] Moses and not only that he he hit twice
[41:13] there was a damage also on the
[41:16] foot of Moses over there so according to
[41:21] the
[41:23] historian when he
[41:25] finished the statue of Moses he was it
[41:30] was so real to him and he talked to
[41:33] Moses but then when Moses wasn't
[41:35] answering he hammered the knee of Moses
[41:39] and screamed
[41:43] speak and that was the Masterpiece amen
[41:47] amen
[41:49] amen so but
[41:52] then we are talking right now to the
[41:55] Masterpiece of God
[41:58] I'm just showing that where brother
[42:01] Brenham took that
[42:04] Masterpiece the prophet said here in in
[42:07] the
[42:09] Masterpiece uh message he said
[42:13] so he set forth on his great piece of
[42:17] marble The Cutting to
[42:20] pattern and bringing down and hoing down
[42:23] until he got to the real picture of what
[42:27] it was have been in his
[42:30] mind remember it was in the mind of
[42:34] Michel
[42:35] Angelo and he keep projecting this for
[42:39] 40
[42:40] years
[42:41] sweat hunger pain people are mocking
[42:48] him he caught the vision first and how
[42:53] he had to work to that Vision cutting up
[42:56] and making King
[42:58] down and when he got it in where he
[43:02] perfected it till it really got perfect
[43:07] he stood and looked at it when he
[43:10] finished up that
[43:13] morning with a hammer in his hand he was
[43:17] so
[43:18] inspired when he looked at it because
[43:22] the vision in his mind was standing
[43:26] before him
[43:35] him to
[43:36] all I always forget this my wife always
[43:40] tell me say thank you to the
[43:45] musician and to
[43:47] the brothers and sisters that are
[43:50] listening right
[43:51] now God bless you may this
[43:55] message touch her heart tonight amen
[43:59] amen and
[44:01] then in reality what he had
[44:05] seen his conception of what Michael of
[44:09] Moses was there it was figure before him
[44:14] what he had in his heart all these years
[44:18] and toils and hours of sorrow and
[44:21] distress and critics and everything else
[44:27] and then when it was
[44:29] completed he stood back with the
[44:34] sculptor hammer in his hand and he
[44:38] looked at that
[44:40] monument and he in uh the inspiration of
[44:44] that
[44:45] Vision that he he had seen of how to do
[44:49] it inspired him so much till he till the
[44:55] inspiration struck him
[44:57] till he got beside himself and struck it
[45:02] across the knee and said
[45:06] speak now there's a flaw on the great
[45:11] image on the knee on the right
[45:16] knee it's a beautiful picture of Moses
[45:21] how did he know the image of
[45:24] Moses because he cre
[45:27] ated that from his mind to the vision
[45:31] amen and to the vision to
[45:36] reality my
[45:39] brother but I was
[45:41] searching about the creation of God you
[45:46] know when Moses said in the beginning
[45:49] God created heaven and the
[45:53] Earth but the prophet said in the
[45:56] beginning beginning God was not
[46:03] God in the beginning God was not even
[46:07] God he was the great Eternal in there
[46:11] was
[46:13] attributes attributes was his
[46:16] thoughts and then he became a
[46:19] word like this and the word
[46:22] express well I thought Express a thought
[46:26] Express
[46:28] is a word a word express is a thought
[46:33] when he created he created himself first
[46:37] the logos the
[46:42] word and then remember if you ever was
[46:47] in God's
[46:48] thinking this is
[46:51] it you always be there amen if you got
[46:56] eternal life you are the expression or
[47:00] the attribute thank you Lord oh this
[47:03] thought for this
[47:05] age if not there is only one eternal
[47:09] life and it's always existed and you in
[47:14] his mind existed before there was a
[47:17] world there's the reason he said he
[47:21] chose you before the foundation of the
[47:24] world Hallelujah
[47:27] that's why you told that sister Nancy I
[47:29] am Nancy Tempi I am the bride of Christ
[47:33] I came from the thought of God I am an
[47:37] eternal you can destroy this body but
[47:40] the inside of me will still praise God
[47:44] Amen that's the reason he said he chose
[47:48] you before the foundation of the world
[47:50] it isn't what he think what somebody
[47:54] else thinks it's what God
[47:57] Eternal you always was in his thinking
[48:02] praise the
[48:05] Lord it was in him to be man that's the
[48:10] reason Christ was the express
[48:14] image The Perfect
[48:17] Image see he was to be the father he was
[48:22] to be the son he was to be savior he was
[48:26] to be
[48:27] healer there was nothing there wasn't
[48:30] even an angel or nothing then he created
[48:35] angels then he become God Amen
[48:40] Hallelujah he was worshiped then there
[48:43] are the manifestation of his
[48:46] thinking that's why brother why I will
[48:49] go back to the
[48:51] world I asked him are you a preacher
[48:54] right now to the denomination
[48:56] he said yes my friend from
[48:59] Pennsylvania he divorced his wife see
[49:03] what's the
[49:04] effect of leaving the message because he
[49:08] thought because of the mistakes I told
[49:12] him
[49:13] brother you were born in the message
[49:17] your father is a pastor in the
[49:22] message and then you you you you left
[49:25] the message you don't read the Bible all
[49:29] prophets has
[49:31] flaws all prophets has
[49:35] mistakes willfully
[49:39] mistakes but then the he said oh well
[49:43] brother you're too late I cannot go back
[49:47] that's right I tried to win you back but
[49:52] it's if you don't want it I said you're
[49:54] a you're a preacher in your church he
[49:56] said yes I'm preaching I said preach the
[49:59] word amen preach the godhead preach the
[50:03] the the the the um how do you call that
[50:08] the Holiness in the
[50:09] church maybe they're going to
[50:15] live everything in the message brother
[50:18] is in the
[50:19] Bible so the prophet explained this to
[50:23] us that God was not God from the very
[50:26] beginning
[50:27] how can he become God he God means
[50:29] object of
[50:30] worship how can be God if no one is
[50:33] worshiping
[50:35] him but then after he created an angel
[50:38] he became
[50:39] Jehovah
[50:42] Hallelujah I thank God for this message
[50:45] Malachi 4 is to restore all the Lo
[50:50] ends Revelation 10:7 all the mystery of
[50:55] God will be revealed am that's why
[50:57] there's no mystery to the bride it's all
[51:05] history when I was a young
[51:08] man young in the
[51:10] message I wasn't a preacher but I always
[51:15] struggle this scripture I always skip
[51:19] this scripture because I cannot
[51:22] understand
[51:23] it Genesis chapter 6 I was uh sharing
[51:26] this to brother Mario and uh brother
[51:28] James last week Genesis chapter 6 verse
[51:33] 5 to
[51:35] 7 I think I didn't uh put that in
[51:39] my so Genesis chapter 65 to
[51:44] 7 I was asking the ministers over there
[51:48] in the Philippines and they cannot
[51:50] explain it to me so I said for me but I
[51:56] praying I need to understand this Lord
[51:58] you said you know you will reveal this
[52:01] to me how can I share your word if this
[52:04] is not open to
[52:06] me and God saw the wickedness of man was
[52:10] great in the earth and that every
[52:13] imagination and of the thoughts of his
[52:17] heart was only evil
[52:21] continually and it repented the Lord
[52:25] that he had made man
[52:27] on the earth and it grieved him at his
[52:32] heart and the Lord said I will destroy
[52:37] man whom I have created from the face of
[52:41] the Earth both man and Beast and the
[52:44] cripping things and the foul of the air
[52:48] for it repented me that I have made
[52:52] man and I
[52:57] cannot explain it if God is omniscient
[53:02] knows all
[53:04] things how he did not know what will
[53:07] going to
[53:08] happen to his
[53:12] creation why he
[53:15] repented so I check that in the diction
[53:18] uh in the uh Greek repented means na
[53:25] come to be sorry
[53:28] sorrowful God was sorry and
[53:33] sorrowful and I keep
[53:35] asking the
[53:37] elders when I was young brother Ron no
[53:40] one can explain it to
[53:42] me but then if you have question in your
[53:45] mind this is my advice as your
[53:49] brother wait on the Lord yes pray wait
[53:55] on the Lord pray wait on on the Lord and
[53:58] then one day I was in the United States
[54:01] already it's like
[54:03] this read it 8 brother and uh to 9
[54:08] Genesis 6
[54:09] 8-9 here's the answer if there's a
[54:12] question of the scripture there's a
[54:15] scripture answered that's
[54:17] right but
[54:19] Noah found Grace in the eyes of the
[54:24] Lord yes the the the
[54:26] the brother the iniquities are all over
[54:30] the
[54:31] place men are drinking men and women are
[54:34] like the
[54:35] same but then David found favor in the
[54:39] sight of the
[54:40] Lord hallelujah Noah found Grace in the
[54:44] eyes of the Lord amen these are the
[54:47] generation of Noah
[54:49] Noah was man and
[54:53] perfect in his generation and Noah
[54:58] walked with God yes in the eyes of the
[55:01] Lord he
[55:03] repented that I will destroy men but
[55:06] then God found favor God found Grace
[55:11] amen hallelujah Noah was perfect and was
[55:16] walking with
[55:18] God praise the
[55:20] Lord very very few the pro the the
[55:23] prophet said 500 will go to the rapture
[55:26] today no one
[55:28] knows no one
[55:30] knows because you know why because we're
[55:34] nobody's
[55:36] amen amen but in the eyes of the lord we
[55:40] are
[55:41] somebody thank you Lord
[55:49] Amen brother that's why we appreciate
[55:53] predestination right election I'm not
[55:56] going to let you uh go to this but uh
[56:00] Romans
[56:02] chapter I'm just uh putting this uh
[56:06] late but I will read it to
[56:09] you Romans 9 11 verse uh chapter 9: 11
[56:14] to uh
[56:17] 14 for the children being not yet born
[56:20] neither having done any
[56:23] good or evil that the purpose of of God
[56:26] according to the election might stand
[56:29] not of works but of him that call
[56:33] it it was said unto her the Elder Shall
[56:37] Serve the younger as it is written Jacob
[56:40] have I Lov they were never born yet but
[56:44] God said Jacob have I loved but Esau
[56:48] have I
[56:51] hated what shall we say then is there's
[56:55] unrighteousness with
[56:57] God God
[57:00] forid for he said to Moses I will have
[57:04] mercy on whom I will have
[57:07] mercy and I will have compassion on whom
[57:11] I will have compassion thank you Lord
[57:15] It's
[57:16] he that loves you brother before the
[57:19] foundation of the world
[57:22] Amen it's a little bit out of the topic
[57:25] but I want to
[57:27] express the word from my
[57:31] heart you know the prophet said when he
[57:34] started building the
[57:38] Masterpiece he said he started the
[57:42] foundation of
[57:43] Faith so there are
[57:46] four Heroes here that the prophet took
[57:51] and he said Abraham was the foundation
[57:55] of this
[57:57] statue then Isaac was the foundation the
[58:01] second
[58:03] Foundation is
[58:06] love now the second was Jacob it was
[58:10] Grace the third
[58:13] was Lo perfect in the eyes of the
[58:17] Lord but still Satan admired
[58:21] him it was Joseph perfection
[58:26] Faith love Grace and
[58:29] Perfection but all the prophets that he
[58:32] created Satan admir
[58:38] them I was
[58:42] searching one of the the almost
[58:46] perfect was the king
[58:51] Hezekiah when Isaiah was C he came to
[58:55] him
[58:56] and Isaiah told him I God is done with
[59:00] you you will
[59:02] die and Hezekiah he turned on the wall
[59:07] and pray he said I walk with you
[59:13] perfectly extend my
[59:17] life and I
[59:20] search King Hezekiah he was so in love
[59:24] with God and he apply the word of the
[59:27] Lord to his
[59:28] kingdom but there's only one
[59:32] flaw you know what is it he invited the
[59:36] king of Babylon and he showed The
[59:40] Treasure of his kingdom and Isaiah came
[59:44] to him and said one day the Babylonian
[59:47] will take all your
[59:49] treasure because you showed it to the
[59:54] unbelievers that's why if you have
[59:56] planned just keep it in your mind yes
[59:58] sir amen
[1:00:03] amen all the prophets had
[1:00:06] flaws all that once was a a portion but
[1:00:10] there is a last coming up through that
[1:00:13] finally comes the
[1:00:16] Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in
[1:00:20] him at all so perfect
[1:00:24] reflected to the building
[1:00:26] himself his own image was reflected in
[1:00:30] his work God and Christ were one in so
[1:00:36] much until he put this is what you were
[1:00:39] talking brother Ron he put his own
[1:00:42] Spirit unto him and then even the image
[1:00:47] and the Builder become one
[1:00:51] Hallelujah God and his sculture work his
[1:00:55] masterpiece
[1:00:56] this is my favorite one
[1:00:59] 79 The Perfect
[1:01:03] Image the God
[1:01:07] man in in
[1:01:10] morphe had changed from
[1:01:14] Supernatural to the vision and the
[1:01:17] vision was was uh projected into the
[1:01:22] image and the image was smitten so so
[1:01:26] that the
[1:01:27] supernatural could taste the feeling of
[1:01:32] death from Supernatural to the
[1:01:36] vision from the vision projected an
[1:01:41] image now could taste the Deb God's
[1:01:45] perfect Masterpiece
[1:01:49] amen but this perfect masterp
[1:01:53] Masterpiece he was the fullness
[1:01:56] of the godhead badle he could not only
[1:01:59] project Moses he could project his
[1:02:03] entire being into the person of this
[1:02:05] person and taste death for the whole
[1:02:08] human race God's perfect Masterpiece God
[1:02:12] so inspired by
[1:02:14] seeing seeing it he became the Redeemer
[1:02:17] of all ages to speak for those in the
[1:02:22] backgrounds who had been before and
[1:02:27] now there's so many images of
[1:02:31] God in the Old
[1:02:34] Testament when when God spoke to job he
[1:02:40] was in the form of
[1:02:44] Whirlwind when God
[1:02:47] spoke to Abraham brother
[1:02:50] Mario he was in the form of
[1:02:54] MDC no father no no
[1:02:56] mother no brothers or no
[1:03:01] sisters he was the king of
[1:03:06] Jerusalem he was the theophany of God
[1:03:09] but he was not perfect
[1:03:13] image when God spoke to Moses and Moses
[1:03:20] long to God I want to see
[1:03:23] you and then Moses said I will not show
[1:03:27] my face to you but I will pass by and
[1:03:31] God saw the back part of God amen amen
[1:03:36] it was the theophany of God but it was
[1:03:39] not the Perfect
[1:03:43] Image what is the
[1:03:46] difference
[1:03:47] of MDC and Jesus
[1:03:50] Christ Jesus Christ had father and
[1:03:55] mother
[1:03:57] MDC doesn't have father and
[1:04:00] mother what is the purpose of Jesus
[1:04:02] Christ to face death so that he can
[1:04:06] redeem us God wants the Masterpiece amen
[1:04:10] the kinsman redeemer
[1:04:13] Hallelujah that's why he became a
[1:04:15] perfect
[1:04:17] image praise the Lord that's that's
[1:04:22] uh that's deep to me brother
[1:04:25] Colossians 2:9 he was the fullness amen
[1:04:31] of the godhead bodily amen Jesus Christ

[1:21:22] the sight of all them that look upon her
[1:21:27] she is a virtuous woman she's different
[1:21:30] from the
[1:21:33] world so
[1:21:36] Esther was taken into the king as we
[1:21:42] Asus into his Royal on in that
[1:21:46] Revelation
[1:21:48] 10:7 Hallelujah in the 10th month which

[1:22:32] speak all that I have is

[1:22:41] 10:7 when God opened this Revelation to
[1:22:45] us brothers and sister how can you not
[1:22:49] speak God gave us an opportunity be to
[1:22:52] be the voice amen am
[1:22:55] speak Revelation
[1:22:57] 108-111
[1:23:00] speak
[1:23:02] prophesy I give you my word I give you
[1:23:06] my voice
[1:23:12] speak my
[1:23:16] brother as I was with
[1:23:22] Moses we are
[1:23:24] identified with the him or with
[1:23:30] them I
[1:23:31] was with
[1:23:33] Moses when he went down This Is Us
[1:23:36] brother do you think you're a a Creator
[1:23:39] although the prophet said before born
[1:23:41] again you are a creator of
[1:23:44] time that's right I thought I am an
[1:23:47] eternal you need to be born again first
[1:23:50] amen before born again you are a
[1:23:53] creation of time
[1:23:55] time but then when you accepted the
[1:23:59] Lord you became the creator of
[1:24:04] Eternity that's why it's it must it's
[1:24:07] not supposed to be or will but you must
[1:24:13] be born again amen amen Brothers if
[1:24:16] you're are not baptized you must be born
[1:24:18] again if you want to be a creature of
[1:24:20] Eternity you must be born again
[1:24:26] but here because we match all the the
[1:24:31] prophets and the women in the Bible
[1:24:33] that's why I can say
[1:24:35] greater than than than than Ruth is
[1:24:39] here greater than Esther is here because
[1:24:43] they projected the life of the Bride
[1:24:46] they're not perfect but the bride is
[1:24:49] perfect amen
[1:24:54] that's why I can say I was with Moses
[1:24:57] when all the people turned against him I
[1:24:59] was with Moses when he was when he
[1:25:03] crossed the Red Sea when he raised his
[1:25:05] hand and walked forward and the Red Sea
[1:25:09] opened I was identified in
[1:25:12] Christ right then I was with
[1:25:15] Moses at that hour whatever Christian
[1:25:19] has been whatever Believers has been
[1:25:22] every believer now is a identified with
[1:25:25] that same person amen whatever it is you
[1:25:29] must be identified don't forget that
[1:25:32] when you do you got to spiritual
[1:25:38] Amnesia you've forgotten who you
[1:25:41] are that's why the fivefold ministry has
[1:25:44] the ministry in the last days to tell
[1:25:47] you bring you little by little here you
[1:25:50] are you know when before you had an
[1:25:52] Amnesia you were perfect
[1:25:54] before you had an AM Amnesia you are
[1:25:57] beautiful fearfully wonderfully made in
[1:26:01] God's
[1:26:02] image but now when the preacher told you
[1:26:07] who you
[1:26:08] are it's time to Rejoice brother I was I

[1:26:16] Ahab when they had to make a choice when
[1:26:20] they would serve God or bail we were was
[1:26:24] with him on Mount Carmel when he had to
[1:26:27] make this choice for we are identified
[1:26:31] in the body of the same God that he was
[1:26:34] identified in so it were identified in
[1:26:37] the body then we must remember we were
[1:26:41] there with him that night that right
[1:26:45] hallelujah amen now I was with
[1:26:49] David when he was rejected by his own
[1:26:53] brethren I was with David you were
[1:26:58] too if you were a Christian if you are a
[1:27:01] Christian you have to be identified in
[1:27:05] his
[1:27:07] rejection I was with Hebrew children in
[1:27:10] the fiery furnace when the fire could it
[1:27:14] burn because of the presence of the
[1:27:17] forthman I was with Daniel in the Lions
[1:27:20] then I was identified in there when the
[1:27:23] angel of the Lord identified him in
[1:27:26] there everything brother the prophets of
[1:27:29] all we are identified with
[1:27:31] them because as as Christ was the
[1:27:35] Perfect Image We Came From
[1:27:38] Him Praise the Lord there's no fault in
[1:27:42] him all
[1:27:44] perfect
[1:27:46] my the prophet said
[1:27:48] notice the bride if the bride in the
[1:27:53] beginning was the word or the bridegroom
[1:27:57] and then if the bride is taken from the
[1:27:59] bridegroom it must be the word
[1:28:03] also the bride must be why must the
[1:28:06] bridegroom to be the word manifested
[1:28:09] made plain because the bride and the
[1:28:13] bridegroom are

[1:29:40] overtake you and wants to to to road
[1:29:44] rage with you brother John and if your
[1:29:47] body will react your body is not perfect

[1:30:55] our last days he was the one that lead
[1:30:58] us to come out from the denominational
[1:31:01] ideas so
[1:31:02] here when the people saw him they
[1:31:07] misinterpreted of him as

[1:42:34] from any
[1:42:36] age that said now I want to take you
[1:42:39] before the
[1:42:41] beginning before he was God takes you
[1:42:44] back into the mind of God and he said he
[1:42:47] had attributes you know all
[1:42:49] that he
[1:42:51] began now he began began to create
[1:42:53] because they were thoughts in his mind
[1:42:55] mind is the womb of the spirit and God
[1:42:58] was a spirit amen he began to create and
[1:43:02] when he
[1:43:03] spoke the word which is the logos of God
[1:43:07] that's the thinking the thought of
[1:43:10] God Christ was the logos thought of
[1:43:15] God you are a part of the very logos of
[1:43:18] God that's why my sheep hear my voice as
[1:43:22] strangers why you're a part of it you
[1:43:25] identified you're the matching piece
[1:43:29] amen here we are in another Eden this is
[1:43:33] Satan's Eden that's why you got to
[1:43:35] struggle here amen this is

[1:43:47] cause you to get
[1:43:49] discouraged all those things H to
[1:43:52] bombard your mind that's why it's a
[1:43:54] spiritual battle amen but you shall
[1:43:57] overcome why he overcame for you amen
