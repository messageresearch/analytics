[30:14] it was really a blessing for tonight am
[30:17] and I would like
[30:19] to invite you to the Book of John
[30:22] chapter 16
[30:24] verse 12 to13 the same uh scripture C
[30:28] that
[30:29] I uh brought last uh service that I
[30:33] have I usually don't uh do
[30:37] a part
[30:39] series because I don't have the gift of
[30:42] that kind of gift as I am just a
[30:45] delivery
[30:46] boy that whatever God put in my heart I
[30:50] just deliver it amen and I believe uh
[30:54] God will give me some nuggets no and the
[30:58] next Minister will catch up and if they
[31:01] have the gift to make a
[31:03] series that's it amen I am just a helper
[31:07] to make the whe keep on
[31:09] running
[31:11] so H thank you tonight I will try to
[31:14] make a part
[31:17] two so John 16 uh verse
[31:24] 12 I have yet many things to say unto
[31:29] you but he cannot bear them now praise
[31:33] God because we know that God knows the
[31:37] season of your life to reveal his truth
[31:39] Amen in Proverbs 15:23 he said a word is
[31:44] a season how good it
[31:47] is and verse 13 how be it when he the
[31:53] spirit of Truth is
[31:55] come he will guide you into all truth
[31:58] truth he will guide you into a clear
[32:01] understanding of the revealed word of
[32:03] your
[32:04] day for he shall not speak of himself
[32:09] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[32:12] he speak and he will show you things to
[32:16] come and we can say that we are now
[32:18] living in a prophetic time prophetic
[32:21] Ministry so I'd like to read the last
[32:26] verse Revelation 107
[32:33] but in the days of the voice of the
[32:35] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[32:38] sound the mystery of God should be
[32:41] finished as he hath declared to his
[32:44] servants the
[32:46] prophets than you and may the Lord add a
[32:48] blessing upon the reading of his word so
[32:51] my you may now be see
[32:55] it so my title is when the spirit of
[32:59] Truth is come part
[33:02] two and sometimes
[33:05] we will ask just like pilate what is
[33:09] truth we want to know truth amen what is
[33:14] truth even brother Ron preed that a
[33:17] while a few years back maybe ass seers
[33:20] of what is
[33:21] truth and we know that truth is the
[33:24] absolute of God's
[33:26] word made clear to you in the spirit of
[33:29] your
[33:31] mind by the holy spirit thank you Lord
[33:35] and the word of God becomes a faith in
[33:37] you then that is
[33:40] truth because he said Thy word is
[33:43] truth the word becomes spirit and life
[33:46] in you and we know that the
[33:48] characteristic of Truth is that it will
[33:51] always set you free
[33:54] amen that's right John 8:32 and ye shall
[33:58] know the truth and the truth shall set
[34:00] you free so we know the truth because
[34:03] the characteristic is that it can
[34:07] liberate us from sin unbelief or
[34:11] doubt praise God into the word of God
[34:13] and we know that we are now living in
[34:15] the prophetic
[34:16] ministry as we said a while ago that the
[34:20] ministry of the Propet is to gather all
[34:24] the loose
[34:25] end and every mystery in the Bible is
[34:28] already being opened and we know that
[34:31] being a
[34:35] prophet sometimes it's hard to to Gras
[34:39] because some of people believe that a
[34:41] prophet knows
[34:42] everything but let us face reality in
[34:46] the
[34:47] fact just like the expression when you
[34:50] are in the vacation and you have a
[34:52] wonderful
[34:54] time uh enjoying the creation of God and
[34:58] the
[34:59] fellowship then after your vacation you
[35:02] have this statement let us go back to
[35:06] reality the reality is after your
[35:08] vacation you have a bill to pay your
[35:11] mortgage your electric your car let us
[35:14] go back to the reality so the prophet in
[35:18] reality he was born a
[35:20] prophet and we know that Prophet is a
[35:24] gift from
[35:26] God and gifts and callings are without
[35:31] repentance the reality is he was born a
[35:35] prophet and he grow become a boy even
[35:39] he at a young age a boy he has the
[35:42] operation of the gift of a prophet was
[35:45] already in operation in his life he can
[35:48] see Vision he can hear voices and some
[35:51] sometimes he cannot understood or
[35:54] understand what it
[35:56] was and we know that he was growing so
[35:59] that's why we believed in the
[36:00] progressive revelation of God because
[36:03] Revelation come from God Amen that come
[36:05] from the prophet it come from God but he
[36:08] need to grow and experience his life
[36:11] that all that experience God is showing
[36:13] him some scriptural truth that become a
[36:17] reality in his life so that's why the
[36:19] prophet is the interpretation of the
[36:21] word of God in our day he didn't just
[36:25] become a prophet just for the prophet
[36:27] but he was expressing God manifesting
[36:30] the word that is being made flesh in our
[36:33] day Hallelujah so that's why we believe
[36:37] that one of the
[36:39] greatest misunderstood subject about the
[36:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[36:44] sensation and the person of
[36:48] Christ praise God being made manifest in
[36:52] our day but I want to look at it in a
[36:56] different angle
[37:00] and we know that the Old
[37:04] Testament begins with a woman
[37:08] conceiving and the New Testament also
[37:10] begin with a woman conceiving amen but
[37:14] we notice that there is a difference in
[37:16] the way they they conceive amen so there
[37:20] is a mystery that lays in here for this
[37:22] last age that was to be fully revealed
[37:25] by the prophet and there must
[37:29] also be a people on Earth at the end
[37:33] time who are able to come into the full
[37:36] understanding of these things so there
[37:38] are two
[37:41] conception and we want to look into
[37:43] Mary's belief as opposed to
[37:48] Elizabeth and look at how manifestation
[37:51] of that came out in their
[37:53] way of
[37:56] conception or how the conception took
[37:58] place in the
[38:01] lives because we know that both Eve and
[38:03] Elizabeth conception or Elizabeth
[38:06] conception came by sensation but Mary is
[38:10] just by believing the word so there is a
[38:14] difference and both of them are type of
[38:17] the Pentecostal and the bright AIDS one
[38:20] is by sensation and one is by believing
[38:22] the word of God so my subject for
[38:26] tonight is conception by the spoken word
[38:29] so turn with me the Book of Luke
[38:32] 1 verse
[38:34] 26-38 so this is where I will get my
[38:37] subject conception by the spoken
[38:41] word Luke chapter 1 verse
[38:44] 26 and in the sixth month the angel
[38:48] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[38:51] Galilee named
[38:54] Nazareth so the angel will not come
[38:56] unless he was sent from God Amen so we
[38:59] have an angel in this last day that sent
[39:01] from God that's right in Malachi I will
[39:04] send you Elijah the prophet that was the
[39:07] angel to the church it was sent praise
[39:10] God
[39:11] directly this Angel was sent directly
[39:14] unto a city of Galilee named
[39:19] Nazareth exact geographical location
[39:24] amen that's good called
[39:28] Nazareth as the prophet said there is no
[39:30] good things come out of
[39:33] Nazareth that's
[39:38] right to a virgin espouse to a man whose
[39:41] name was Joseph of the House of David
[39:44] and the virgin's name was
[39:47] Mary so we will notice this Angel come
[39:50] from Eternal
[39:52] realm and down to a
[39:55] geographical location yeah praise the
[39:58] Lord amen God knows where to send his
[40:03] Angel that's right he sent an angel in
[40:07] Africa he sent his angel in Mexico he
[40:09] sent an angel in the Philippines he sent
[40:11] an angel here in Phoenix hallelujah
[40:14] thank you Lord that's
[40:17] good a specific time of history and a
[40:21] specific woman
[40:26] amen in other words there was no guess
[40:29] work
[40:30] involved and neither is there any guess
[40:33] work involved by God calling us thank
[40:37] you Jesus there is no guessing work that
[40:39] you receive the message of the hour
[40:42] because God is sending his Angel exactly
[40:45] where you are
[40:51] at thank you Lord God Don't Make
[40:54] Mistakes that's right what God calls is
[40:57] not a mistake but you are the
[40:59] manifestation that God sent an angel in
[41:01] this last day and he said that this is
[41:03] now the Gathering of the elect where are
[41:07] we are gathering not in the Church of
[41:09] brother Ron we are gathering through the
[41:11] revealed word of the hour God is calling
[41:14] his bride from all kind tongue and
[41:17] people hallelujah so that we can join to
[41:20] our bride Grom the Lord Jesus
[41:23] Christ thank you
[41:25] Lord that's the truth no guessing
[41:29] work that's enough for us to go home and
[41:34] rejoice can I go home now
[41:37] hallelujah amen you need to to to to get
[41:42] it personalize in your heart because
[41:45] Mary is a type of the Bride of Jesus
[41:48] Christ that's right and the angel came
[41:51] into her and said hail Thou Art highly
[41:55] favored
[41:57] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[42:00] among
[42:02] women and when she saw she was troubled
[42:05] at is
[42:05] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[42:09] of salutation this should
[42:12] be there's always a question
[42:15] mark why did I receive the message how
[42:18] come I receive the message how there's
[42:21] always a question but when there's a
[42:24] Biblical question there's always a
[42:25] Biblical answer amen if you have a
[42:28] question there is always an answer
[42:30] that's
[42:31] right and the angel said unto fear not
[42:34] Mary for th was found favor with
[42:39] God Jesus the visitation of
[42:44] Angel gave
[42:47] favor to
[42:49] Mary so the Angel's visitation in our
[42:53] generation is a favor from God to us
[42:57] Hallelujah it is not a mistake that an
[43:00] angel had been coming down in our
[43:03] generation the mighty angel of
[43:06] Revelation 101 the angel of the Covenant
[43:09] which is the Lord Jesus Christ and this
[43:11] is the favor of God and remember that a
[43:14] prophet in this generation always
[43:16] represent God to the people amen when
[43:19] there is a prophet in the land god is in
[43:22] the land remember when John the Baptist
[43:25] he is propagating he is preparing the
[43:27] way for the Lord and when the Lord was
[43:30] come Behold the Lamb of God takes away
[43:33] the sins of the world he will not say
[43:35] Behold the Lamb of God if there is
[43:37] nobody in there that's right so likewise
[43:40] the prophet in this generation forun the
[43:42] second coming of Christ that means that
[43:45] God is in our
[43:48] midst the visitations of God in this
[43:50] land that's why the prophet said I must
[43:52] decrease and he must
[43:54] increase that's why when the prophet is
[43:57] out of the se he is still here in the
[43:59] form of the fer of fire praise God and
[44:02] revealing himself to the word of God he
[44:06] never leave us because the prophet for
[44:08] today is the Holy Ghost
[44:11] himself the prophetic Ministry of
[44:15] God
[44:17] hallelujah and behold Thou shalt
[44:20] conceive in thy womb and bring forth a
[44:23] son and shall call his name Jesus
[44:27] so look at the message of the Angel it
[44:29] is connected praise
[44:32] God about a conception in the
[44:37] womb and behold th shall conceive in thy
[44:40] womb and bring forth a son shall call
[44:42] his name Jesus the message is already
[44:44] being
[44:47] done
[44:50] Glory there's no other message that's
[44:53] right the message is already been given
[44:56] and thou shall call his name
[45:00] Jesus thank you
[45:07] Lord that is why the seventh angel
[45:10] message is also connected with the
[45:12] teaching about conception in the womb of
[45:15] a woman in this
[45:17] day this is about conception amen and he
[45:21] shall be great and shall be called the
[45:23] son of the highest the Lord God shall
[45:26] give unto to him the Throne of his
[45:28] father
[45:29] David this
[45:32] prophesied this is prophecy from Isaiah
[45:36] 714
[45:37] 730 or 40 years before it came to
[45:42] manifestation to a very specific place
[45:46] to a very specific
[45:49] woman and the angel know his name and
[45:52] called him
[45:54] Mary amen Jes there is no accident you
[45:58] need to be grateful in this last day the
[46:00] same message is just a shadow on type in
[46:03] our
[46:04] generation it's about the conception of
[46:07] the word of God in these last days amen
[46:09] and he shall reign over the house of
[46:11] Jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[46:15] shall be no end oh Hallelujah and then
[46:19] Mary said unto the angel how shall this
[46:22] thing be saying I know not a man
[46:27] yeah good question
[46:30] notice her first and only
[46:35] question first and only
[46:38] question because for a thousand years
[46:40] every woman had conceived only by one
[46:43] way that's right that's right the human
[46:45] race knew of no other method of
[46:49] conception right but now Mary was being
[46:52] asked to
[46:53] believe in a conception by a way that
[46:56] had never happened to a woman
[47:01] [Applause]
[47:03] before it's hard to
[47:05] believe and even Joseph cannot believe
[47:08] it and he was trying
[47:12] to to put her away
[47:17] privately and the angel answered and
[47:20] said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come
[47:23] upon thee praise God amen amen yes sir
[47:28] The Impossible thing that you cannot
[47:31] understand God will send the Holy Ghost
[47:33] that's why when the spirit of to this
[47:35] come he will guide you into
[47:37] alen and the angel answered and said
[47:39] unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[47:41] thee and the power of the highest shall
[47:44] overshadow
[47:45] thee before therefore also that Holy
[47:49] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[47:51] be called The Son of
[47:53] God glory amen he didn't called that the
[47:57] born of will be a
[47:59] God God knows exactly how to put his
[48:02] word Son of God Amen and Son of God had
[48:06] beginning and had ending there is no
[48:08] such thing as Eternal God as what the
[48:11] denominations trying to to to make us
[48:15] understand because being a son is all
[48:18] for the purpose of
[48:19] redemption amen and behold they cast and
[48:23] Angel and said unto her the Holy Ghost
[48:24] shall come upon thee and the power of
[48:26] the shall overshadow thee therefore also
[48:29] that Holy thing which shall be born of
[48:32] thee shall be called The Son of
[48:35] God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she
[48:40] also conceived a son in her old
[48:47] age and this is the sixth month with her
[48:51] who was called
[48:55] Baron praise before the angel appeared
[48:58] to Mary he already appeared to Elizabeth
[49:02] 6 months
[49:04] prior and Elizabeth was Barren but
[49:07] praise God as the scripture said for
[49:09] with God nothing shall be impossible
[49:12] amen hallelujah and Mary said behold the
[49:15] hand made of the Lord let OB be it unto
[49:19] me according to Thy word and the angel
[49:23] departed from her amen so there are two
[49:26] we women
[49:28] mentioned Elizabeth and
[49:31] Mary two women mentioned here together
[49:34] Mary and Elizabeth and Elizabeth
[49:36] conception like Eve came by the
[49:38] sensations of the flesh between a man
[49:41] and a woman but the contrast we see that
[49:45] here is that Mary conception came
[49:47] without sensation and we know that
[49:50] Elizabeth represent the
[49:52] Pentecostal denomination idea they are
[49:56] conceiving the GI through Sensations and
[49:58] emotion whereas Mary conceived by
[50:02] believing the word of the angel that was
[50:05] sent in her
[50:06] day just like brother Bram the
[50:08] Forerunner of Christ oh we know that
[50:12] Elizabeth represent the Lan AGS we are
[50:16] fully convinced with that because in the
[50:18] last days there are only
[50:20] similarity and and even Elizabeth and
[50:23] Mary are cousin right
[50:29] right and we know that Elizabeth
[50:31] represent Lan Pentecostal Forerunner of
[50:33] the first coming of Christ came out of
[50:35] Elizabeth womb just as brother Branham
[50:38] the Forerunner of Christ Second Coming
[50:40] came out of Pentecostal age womb of the
[50:43] seventh age and that is why Elizabeth
[50:46] being the older woman conceived first
[50:48] and Mary is the younger woman conceived
[50:51] lust because the briad Aid comes after
[50:54] the Pentecostal age yes
[50:57] amen praise
[51:01] God so the message God's only provided
[51:04] place of
[51:07] worship brother bam said remember how we
[51:09] just went through the church ages the
[51:11] messenger of the church always come just
[51:14] at the dying of the other Church
[51:18] age always dying of the Pentecost bring
[51:22] forth the rupturing of the
[51:25] Bride wow
[51:27] the dying of the Luther brought forth
[51:29] Wesley and the dying of Wesley brought
[51:32] forth the Pentecost and the dying of
[51:34] Pentecost brings forth the message
[51:39] now so that's why the prophet said you
[51:42] got to die to the Lutheran age to be
[51:44] born into the westle age you have to die
[51:46] in the wesle age to be born in the
[51:48] pescal age and you have to die in the
[51:51] Pentecostal
[51:53] age live nothing of it
[51:59] leave nothing of it left burn it with
[52:01] fire because it's going to be burn like
[52:04] The Stoke that the wheat comes out
[52:08] of the stock the denomination it's got
[52:11] to be
[52:12] burned so don't bring your
[52:16] denominational denomination over into
[52:19] this new message this is the word now
[52:23] this is no longer man's ideas being into
[52:26] the message so that's why excuse me
[52:29] that's why the prophet said you need to
[52:31] die to your denominational idea don't
[52:33] bring your denominational idea into this
[52:37] bright
[52:39] age and I have this experience when I
[52:42] met
[52:43] my uh uh uh a close friend a Pentecostal
[52:49] Minister and we know that we have the
[52:51] idea that the prophet said that the
[52:52] Pentecostal are really allergic to the
[52:55] word predestination
[52:59] so I'm going to tease
[53:00] him so brother do you believe in
[53:03] predestination but I know that they are
[53:04] allergic to predestination but I try
[53:07] to to to provoke
[53:11] him what they understanding about
[53:14] predestination right because there is a
[53:16] lot of issues because baptism with the
[53:19] Holy Ghost without sensation and this
[53:20] pred predestination comes
[53:23] together so I asked him brother praise
[53:26] God do you believe in predestination and
[53:29] when he say yes I was
[53:31] surprised I thought he will react
[53:34] something like that oh you really you
[53:36] believe in predestin yes we believe in
[53:38] predestin how do you give me how do you
[53:42] explain
[53:43] predestination well if you are
[53:47] predestinated if you keep going to
[53:49] church if you keep serving the lord then
[53:52] it shows that you are predestinated
[53:57] but if you stop then you are not
[54:01] predestinated and he gave me an example
[54:04] just like an example you are riding in
[54:06] the train to a certain
[54:08] destination and you fall into the from
[54:11] the
[54:14] train how can you be predestinated if
[54:16] you
[54:18] fall so that is their understanding
[54:21] about predestination it seems that you
[54:24] need to put an effort in order to show
[54:27] that you are predestinated and that idea
[54:30] is tripping in into the message of the
[54:32] hour it seems that you need to work out
[54:34] to make an evidence that you are
[54:37] predestinated you need to work out you
[54:39] need to go to church every day to show
[54:41] if it's show
[54:43] no you don't need to work out to show
[54:46] you that you are
[54:48] predestinated that's
[54:50] right because a lot of people go to
[54:52] church with different reason
[54:55] right that's why we can see people
[54:57] coming in the church for how many years
[54:59] then go they they G then another come in
[55:03] they have different
[55:06] reason so that's why there are three
[55:08] classes of people in the
[55:10] church those who make things happen and
[55:13] those who make who watch things happen
[55:16] and those who are wondering what
[55:19] happened
[55:20] amen the believer the make believer the
[55:24] unbeliever you say they unbeliever no
[55:28] believer as the prophet said but there
[55:30] is an an but they believe when you say
[55:34] something they believe but they cannot
[55:35] believe or have faith in what you say so
[55:39] you don't need to to to to to make an
[55:44] effort to prove that you are
[55:45] predestinated because predestination is
[55:47] come from God Amen and I told him our
[55:51] understanding of predestination is amen
[55:55] if I I'm in the train and I fall from
[56:00] the train God will stop the train and
[56:03] put me back in the train until I reach
[56:05] my destination that is our understanding
[56:08] of predestination because predestination
[56:11] PR God we are predestinate before the
[56:13] foundation of the
[56:15] word we don't need to prove anything
[56:19] that we are predestinated God will prove
[56:22] his predestination in our lives thank
[56:25] you Jesus
[56:27] praise the Lord you don't need to prove
[56:30] anything okay but that understanding of
[56:33] the Pentecost is creeping into the
[56:36] church you need to do something you need
[56:37] to do something if you are predestinated
[56:39] you are to do something come
[56:42] on you need to be faithful in the church
[56:45] you need to do this you need to have
[56:46] long hair that that and then you are
[56:49] predestinated but predestination is so
[56:52] different you are
[56:55] predestinated as the prophet said by the
[56:57] for knowledge of God he knows the
[56:59] beginning and the end that's
[57:02] rights and being predestinate doesn't
[57:05] mean that we cannot do anything about
[57:07] oursel we just follow
[57:09] no
[57:11] predestination give us a premoral
[57:17] agency you have the right to accept and
[57:20] you have the right to reject
[57:22] it but because of predestination
[57:26] even though you backslide even though
[57:29] you're
[57:30] fall God's purpose is to express his
[57:36] attributes that's why he allowed that
[57:38] you fall in order for his his attributes
[57:41] as a redeemer be expressed in your
[57:44] life you don't need to prove I don't
[57:46] backl that
[57:48] no even if you back slide as the prophet
[57:51] said as Paul said all things works
[57:54] together for good to them love the Lord
[57:58] he allows sickness he allow everything
[58:00] in order for his attributes to
[58:04] express thank you Lord your failure has
[58:07] nothing to do with what he has
[58:10] predestinate because predestination
[58:12] didn't start
[58:14] yesterday that's right that's right when
[58:17] you read your scripture you are
[58:18] predestinated even before the foundation
[58:20] of Lord as if it only just yesterday
[58:23] that you are predestinated amen yeah
[58:25] amen very
[58:27] oh praise the Lord as the prophet
[58:30] said her daughter come to Daddy Daddy it
[58:34] seems that the scripture is contrary to
[58:37] what the S had said because the
[58:39] scripture said that the world was
[58:43] created in seven
[58:44] days and the prophet said there is no
[58:48] contradiction because in the beginning
[58:50] when God created the Heaven the Earth
[58:53] period he said maybe it takes Millions
[58:56] and millions and millions of years amen
[58:58] that's right then verse
[59:01] two amen it takes millions and millions
[59:04] of Earth there is another civilization
[59:07] within verse two and then verse three
[59:10] said let there be light and that light
[59:12] didn't come
[59:13] instantly and the Propet said that light
[59:16] maybe is wooing maybe millions and
[59:19] millions and millions of
[59:23] years then Paul
[59:26] said you are chosen and predestinated
[59:30] before the foundation of the
[59:32] word if the word was created for
[59:35] millions and millions of years how about
[59:37] you are prediced before the foundation
[59:40] of the world praise God thank you so our
[59:44] thought has nothing to do with our lives
[59:47] God knows exactly where we begin and God
[59:49] exactly where we end because what he
[59:52] started he is going to finish it this
[59:54] has nothing to do with us Hallelujah god
[59:57] require us to
[59:59] believe believe in the works that he has
[1:00:02] already
[1:00:04] done you have nothing to do with it just
[1:00:07] like Mary he has nothing to do with it
[1:00:10] but to believe be at to me according to
[1:00:13] your word we have the message in this
[1:00:16] last days my brothers you don't put any
[1:00:18] ideas into the message of the hour
[1:00:21] that's why when the prophet said
[1:00:27] in a
[1:00:29] message being led by the Holy Spirit he
[1:00:33] said you can teach Pentecostal babies
[1:00:35] Supernatural things that's
[1:00:41] right so you notice that the angel
[1:00:44] called Supernatural
[1:00:46] things the deeper teaching of the
[1:00:49] word that's
[1:00:52] right some Pentecostal babies in the
[1:00:55] message
[1:00:57] I remember that babies try to copy what
[1:01:00] they see that's good
[1:01:03] amen they try to impersonate and knock
[1:01:06] out what they see others doing right if
[1:01:10] this church is going shouting shouting
[1:01:12] other babies
[1:01:14] impersonating they are trying to copy
[1:01:17] one
[1:01:17] another but we are not copying any other
[1:01:20] but we are praise God leaving the word
[1:01:25] that was being we in our
[1:01:28] day they are impressed with Stage
[1:01:32] performances running in the ppit
[1:01:34] shouting Dan and then and you say you
[1:01:36] feel the spirit of God come
[1:01:40] on and so the Holy Spirit was
[1:01:42] identifying the maturity level of the
[1:01:45] Church of laia but we are not in a baby
[1:01:48] age
[1:01:50] anymore thank you
[1:01:53] Lord because we have crossed over over
[1:01:56] through the door an Open Door in heaven
[1:02:00] we are living in a time when the bride
[1:02:02] is to come to a full Perfection yes of
[1:02:06] maturity yes in order to bring
[1:02:09] resurrection and the Rapture you need to
[1:02:12] be matured in the word that's
[1:02:17] right so this is what the prophet said I
[1:02:20] know we we there are so many quotes with
[1:02:23] regards to British Nation but this is
[1:02:26] a quotation that God puts in my heart
[1:02:28] you know before there was a word you
[1:02:29] were in God's
[1:02:31] thought that's right remember that the
[1:02:33] word was created millions and millions
[1:02:35] of millions of Earth so how about when
[1:02:38] you are in the thought of God millions
[1:02:39] and we don't know nothing about it
[1:02:41] that's right but now it is being
[1:02:43] revealed unto us and we need to run and
[1:02:47] rejoice we ought to be the most happiest
[1:02:50] people around the earth because
[1:02:51] everything that comes in our way God
[1:02:54] already knows about
[1:02:57] he just want us to
[1:03:03] believe I will
[1:03:07] continue God told to give you the Holy
[1:03:09] Ghost because he knew that you're
[1:03:11] wanting it amen and he chose you himself
[1:03:15] because you desire he chose you in
[1:03:17] Christ before you or Jesus or any of you
[1:03:20] was on Earth
[1:03:23] amen that's the truth this is not an
[1:03:25] ordinary stuff this is this come from
[1:03:29] the mind of God it's just conveying the
[1:03:32] thought of God through the mouth of the
[1:03:34] Prophet that's because the prophet is
[1:03:37] representing the word always come to the
[1:03:40] prophet so he's sharing the
[1:03:42] word thank you Lord to establish Us in
[1:03:45] his word
[1:03:47] amen Christ before you Jesus any of you
[1:03:50] on Earth and He sent Jesus to die to
[1:03:53] prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost
[1:03:55] to bring you to
[1:03:59] himself this is a church so I'm at home
[1:04:02] now so he speaking about deeper
[1:04:05] things oh that is so rich to me to think
[1:04:09] is not what I
[1:04:12] wanted it wasn't my desire it wasn't my
[1:04:15] will it wasn't my choosing I had not one
[1:04:17] thing to do with it that's right but
[1:04:21] before the word ever started God saw us
[1:04:23] and put our name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:25] that before there even was a word talk
[1:04:28] about
[1:04:29] God hallelujah it isn't our desire to be
[1:04:33] a Christian is our desire praise God it
[1:04:35] was God's
[1:04:36] desire thank you Jesus thank you Lord we
[1:04:40] ought to be thankful I stood outand with
[1:04:42] the big
[1:04:44] L so I will jump to to the Highlight
[1:04:47] before there was a word before there was
[1:04:49] a planet before there was a sun before
[1:04:51] there was a moon before there was a
[1:04:53] light before there was anything we was
[1:04:56] still God God and His thought the
[1:04:58] Eternal thoughts of God Choose
[1:05:01] You by predestination prise God by for
[1:05:05] knowledge to know that you would be on
[1:05:07] earth to know there would be Hallelujah
[1:05:10] sin that's right he knows about you God
[1:05:14] knows about us more than we know about
[1:05:16] ourselves that's right that's why God
[1:05:19] said a prophet is like to make us known
[1:05:22] the mystery of his will in our life
[1:05:25] all our struggle or ups and downs and
[1:05:28] all trials praise God God knows about it
[1:05:31] thank you Lord and sometimes he allow
[1:05:34] it to some to fall to sin in order to
[1:05:38] express his attribute that how gracious
[1:05:40] our God is amen that's right and someone
[1:05:45] said then why why why there is sin it
[1:05:48] never been sin his attribute would never
[1:05:51] had been a savior there had to be a
[1:05:54] sinner so he could be a savior that's
[1:05:56] what what we're saying God allow
[1:05:58] everything in order to express his
[1:06:00] attribute there had to be a sick man so
[1:06:02] he could be a
[1:06:04] Healer that is one OB attribut that's
[1:06:07] why my brother and sister when brother
[1:06:09] Brenham preach about the law having a
[1:06:12] shadow he said that why I believe the
[1:06:15] time will soon
[1:06:17] arrive that when healing will be a
[1:06:20] miracle healing will be such a common
[1:06:22] thing amen we've got to get some
[1:06:26] rupturing faith in the church to get
[1:06:28] away from here from one of these days we
[1:06:31] need rupturing Faith that's right
[1:06:34] am and even healing we cannot major oh I
[1:06:38] am Vindicated because in our church God
[1:06:41] show Supernatural
[1:06:44] thing signs will follow if you
[1:06:47] believe am healing will follow if you
[1:06:51] believe because it's already
[1:06:54] done and God provide healing not only
[1:06:57] our Physical Realm in our spirit realm
[1:06:59] and in our
[1:07:01] soul amen there will come a time soon
[1:07:05] and that soon is now amen we can see a
[1:07:09] lot of people being sick and they healed
[1:07:11] God do miraculous thing but that is the
[1:07:15] aest of the Rapture the aest that the
[1:07:18] soon coming the changing of our body is
[1:07:20] coming soon we are not looking that we
[1:07:23] need to be perfect and holy and walk
[1:07:25] holy praise God we just need to believe
[1:07:28] the word hallelujah that he has already
[1:07:31] done it is already done didn't require
[1:07:34] us to believe on the things that he
[1:07:38] is just like our Father Abraham amen he
[1:07:42] is a nobody he is a a idol
[1:07:48] worshipper but out of nowhere but for
[1:07:50] knowledge of God God appeared unto him
[1:07:54] and gave a covenant I will will make you
[1:07:56] a father of many nation which is very
[1:07:59] impossible because he is already
[1:08:03] old thank you Lord and you can argue why
[1:08:05] don't you give me a child when I was
[1:08:07] still
[1:08:08] young that's why you cannot question the
[1:08:12] God's grace he require us to believe
[1:08:15] what he has done that's that's why the
[1:08:18] scripture said
[1:08:21] and it was imputed unto him for his
[1:08:24] righteousness
[1:08:26] he's believing the word it doesn't mean
[1:08:28] when you believe the word you are only
[1:08:30] already immune to all the trials
[1:08:33] remember when he received the message of
[1:08:36] the promise of this day trials begin to
[1:08:38] set in amen when the prophet said
[1:08:41] separate yourself from your Kindred and
[1:08:43] people and all the family the first
[1:08:45] thing that happened that went with
[1:08:49] him he done really thought it very well
[1:08:53] and he suffered the consequen
[1:08:56] that's
[1:08:57] right but did it take away the promised
[1:09:00] Covenant of God to him no God is only
[1:09:04] expressing his
[1:09:07] graciousness because Abraham believed
[1:09:09] the promise God is keeping his
[1:09:14] word and Abraham they live in Jerusalem
[1:09:18] Betto which is the house of God then
[1:09:20] ping strike and the first thing he do he
[1:09:23] went from Jerusalem go to Egypt
[1:09:27] and he was afraid to die and he told his
[1:09:30] wife tell him if they ask tell him that
[1:09:33] you are my
[1:09:35] sister imagine what a traumatic
[1:09:37] experience it did for
[1:09:43] Sarah that is just what we
[1:09:46] read tell tell the king that you are my
[1:09:50] sister and Sarah also tell the king so
[1:09:54] that's why the the
[1:09:56] king wants to marry the sister do you
[1:10:00] think Sarah is not murmuring inside oh
[1:10:02] Abraham if I have a time I will
[1:10:05] C why did you do this Abraham you are
[1:10:08] the responsible husband you are the head
[1:10:11] of the family why did you do
[1:10:16] this but God keep his promise because
[1:10:19] Abraham
[1:10:21] believed amen and God appear to the the
[1:10:25] king return my Prophet or I will kill
[1:10:29] you y amen and the King said you know
[1:10:33] the Integrity of My Heart Lord just
[1:10:36] return it why God is keeping his
[1:10:40] promise he was not keeping Abraham
[1:10:43] physical but he was keeping Abraham
[1:10:45] because Abraham believed the promise
[1:10:48] amen it has nothing to do with our
[1:10:50] acation because he has so many failures
[1:10:53] in his life that's right true maybe when
[1:10:57] Sarah was returned to
[1:11:01] Abraham Sarah will say Okay cook by
[1:11:04] yourself cook your own food wash your
[1:11:06] own this uh do the
[1:11:11] laundry she has a traumatic experience
[1:11:14] for maybe for years amen that she will
[1:11:17] not
[1:11:20] forget that's why when the time come he
[1:11:23] said maybe I am
[1:11:27] not included in the promise take
[1:11:31] Hagar and Abraham
[1:11:35] because he
[1:11:37] did no good to Sarah he just okay Sarah
[1:11:40] to cover up his shortcoming I'll take
[1:11:44] hugger but we need to com he compromised
[1:11:47] he
[1:11:49] compromised but did God take
[1:11:52] away his Covenant with Abraham no right
[1:11:56] God keep his Covenant with Abraham why
[1:11:59] the more sometimes Abraham is to is
[1:12:04] to is run out of faith and God appear to
[1:12:08] him I am else sh I amen I will give you
[1:12:12] strength to move on thank you Lord if
[1:12:15] you fail and you fall sometimes we are
[1:12:16] discouraged sometimes we don't want to
[1:12:18] go to church but it was God will appear
[1:12:20] and encourage you because that is what
[1:12:23] his attribute he is keeping his promise
[1:12:25] to and every one of us that is
[1:12:27] predestination our work has nothing to
[1:12:29] do with it our shortcoming has nothing
[1:12:32] to do with
[1:12:34] it God is in it all
[1:12:38] amen even
[1:12:40] Jonah and we know the story of Jonah he
[1:12:43] was commissioned to go to n he went to
[1:12:46] sers but God before it happened God
[1:12:49] already prepared a whale so that's why
[1:12:51] in the beginning of Genesis God created
[1:12:53] a whale and took for how many years for
[1:12:56] it to to happen and to manifest because
[1:13:00] Jonah God knows that he is
[1:13:02] going different direction amen so before
[1:13:06] it happened he already prepared a well
[1:13:08] oh praise the Lord
[1:13:12] right how gracious God is yes he is amen
[1:13:18] we don't need to prove anything in this
[1:13:20] physical place that we are predestinated
[1:13:22] the only thing you know that you are
[1:13:24] predestinated you can say Amen to the
[1:13:27] word that was said in your
[1:13:29] day no doubts no interpretation just say
[1:13:32] Amen even even if you
[1:13:34] cannot understand it you just say amen
[1:13:37] amen because God is the one that will
[1:13:40] yes work his way through your life until
[1:13:44] you
[1:13:45] recognize that it was not
[1:13:48] you not your effort to go to church it
[1:13:51] was God that lead from you are still a
[1:13:56] little baby until now it was God all the
[1:13:59] way in your failure in your
[1:14:03] discouragement God is in it all the way
[1:14:06] through because he will never change his
[1:14:08] mind about you because you are
[1:14:11] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:14:14] the world and predestination is our
[1:14:17] foundation in this like if we see the
[1:14:19] program of God in our life we can just
[1:14:22] say amen and rejoice forever more
[1:14:26] Hallelujah because being in the rupture
[1:14:28] is not the work of our
[1:14:30] flesh being in the rupture is believing
[1:14:33] the word that he has already done in our
[1:14:37] life he's just conveying his
[1:14:40] thought to the predestinated Sons and
[1:14:43] Daughters of
[1:14:45] God thank you Lord and sometimes we have
[1:14:48] this terminology Sons and Daughters then
[1:14:50] we have bride and wife they are the same
[1:14:52] person
[1:15:01] it had to be that way it was God who saw
[1:15:04] it and for orain
[1:15:06] it remember this I don't know
[1:15:09] if remember the devil ain't even in the
[1:15:15] race we are always blaming the
[1:15:21] devil when we have something in our
[1:15:23] lives oh the devil do this the devil do
[1:15:25] that but is the word from the prophet he
[1:15:28] said the devil ain't even in the race oh
[1:15:31] he's just a tough on the side of the
[1:15:33] road that God used to bring children to
[1:15:38] him thank you
[1:15:40] Lord that's why if you run away from God
[1:15:43] God will use the
[1:15:47] Devil he's just an instrument for you to
[1:15:51] cry father God forgive me I'm going back
[1:15:55] into your
[1:15:56] presence no wonder own that day how the
[1:15:59] Angels Sing when we're singing the
[1:16:02] Redemption Stories the angels will bow
[1:16:05] their head and don't know what we're
[1:16:07] talking about that's right that's
[1:16:10] right Hallelujah that's why I can always
[1:16:13] say when they preaching of the word and
[1:16:15] you don't respond you you are just like
[1:16:21] Angels because they don't know about the
[1:16:23] Redemption story amen they don't respond
[1:16:26] they don't see they just look at you and
[1:16:28] they B you that's what the prophet said
[1:16:30] they are angels amen look like
[1:16:34] angels we don't want of course sometimes
[1:16:38] we we become we we get emotional that's
[1:16:41] right but the prophet said any religion
[1:16:44] without an emotion is dead that's right
[1:16:48] but our stimulation come by the wine of
[1:16:52] the revelation of the word of God we are
[1:16:55] stimulated by the revealed word of the
[1:16:58] hour not by emotion or Somebody's Crying
[1:17:01] and you cry too no that's right our
[1:17:04] stimulation come by the revealed word of
[1:17:06] the hour that is that's why we can
[1:17:08] respond amen we can respond an nameen to
[1:17:11] the word of God and you can feel you are
[1:17:13] now sitting in Heavenly
[1:17:15] places thank you Lord hallelujah when

[1:24:58] him 400
[1:25:00] billions millions and trillion years ago
[1:25:04] how could I have chose
[1:25:07] him oh Hallelujah but he chose me amen
[1:25:12] oh brother that's it chosen Us in him
[1:25:15] before the foundation of the word that
[1:25:17] we should be
[1:25:19] holy he put an apostrophe in it now
[1:25:23] don't try to make it
[1:25:25] yourself cuz you
[1:25:28] can but the Pentecostal concept of
[1:25:31] predestination is you need to have an
[1:25:33] evidence that you are
[1:25:37] predestinated but predestination is from
[1:25:39] God and God
[1:25:41] Alone amen you don't need to act you
[1:25:44] need to believe the word believe the
[1:25:47] word eat the word the more you eat the
[1:25:49] word the more you become the word that's
[1:25:52] that that's the only thing that we can
[1:25:54] do in this life eat the word hallelujah
[1:25:57] eat the word not denominational word
[1:26:02] amen but the mystery which is being
[1:26:05] revealed in our
[1:26:07] day don't try to make it yourself cuz
[1:26:10] you
[1:26:11] can't because Without Blame before him
[1:26:15] in love it was God's love for us that he
[1:26:18] chose us oh thank you Jesus
[1:26:23] hallelujah what the Blessed people we
[1:26:25] are amen we are nobody we are nothing
[1:26:29] but God send his angel in exactly
[1:26:32] geographical location where you are at
[1:26:35] in order for you to receive the message
[1:26:37] of the hallelujah thank you Lord praise
[1:26:41] the Lord amen I remember
[1:26:44] brother Murphy W from Clover there when
[1:26:47] I metet him in in the Philippines and I
[1:26:49] said how did you come to to to the
[1:26:52] message of the hour so they told me that
[1:26:55] we we we we are in China and we
[1:26:57] gathering together we have a just a
[1:27:00] Bible uh Bible study we are just hiding
[1:27:03] and hiding there was an American an
[1:27:05] American who was giving the spoken
[1:27:08] word and he heard that the police are
[1:27:11] coming and they are trying
[1:27:13] to cuss those American people so because
[1:27:17] of his Mercy he went to the American and
[1:27:20] said can you give me the book because or
[1:27:23] or just go away because the police are
[1:27:25] coming to cut
[1:27:26] you and they will not go just keep on
[1:27:30] treating so by by that time he said I
[1:27:34] will just keep that book and you can go
[1:27:38] away and he keep the
[1:27:40] book for half days then finally he read
[1:27:45] the book and that's the beginning where
[1:27:47] God called him Lord and He preached the
[1:27:50] gospel to all over China and when he
[1:27:52] went to the Philippines he brought
[1:27:54] four young ministers one in the prison
[1:27:57] ministry he was persecuted in the prison
[1:28:00] uh all the hard persecution that she
[1:28:03] receiv but on top of that it was time
[1:28:06] for him to share the gospel amen and the
[1:28:11] gospel reach to a different city in
[1:28:16] China amen is that not
[1:28:20] predestination it is not man's doing man
[1:28:23] has nothing to do with it it was God's
[1:28:25] program all the way from the beginning
[1:28:28] to the end we just need to Humble
[1:28:30] ourselves Lord if you call me whatever
[1:28:34] things you want me to do let me humble
[1:28:38] myself amen and do
[1:28:40] it I have many failures I have so many
[1:28:43] things but Lord I humbl myself just help
[1:28:45] me
[1:28:46] Lord that's the only thing we can do
[1:28:48] humble ourselves in the presence of the
[1:28:50] Lord
[1:28:54] so let us go
[1:28:56] back to our
[1:28:59] subject conceiving by the spoken word in
[1:29:04] Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself
[1:29:08] shall give you a sign Behold a virgin
[1:29:11] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[1:29:13] call his name
[1:29:18] Emmanuel that was a prophecy and 730
[1:29:22] years ago that prophecy is grooming
[1:29:24] around the
[1:29:27] earth is looking for the bed Mary was
[1:29:31] not born yet that's right maybe he's uh
[1:29:36] her grandfather or grandma or
[1:29:39] whatever but that word keep on
[1:29:43] rolling looking for the
[1:29:46] place for that to
[1:29:49] fulfill and he's looking for a perfect
[1:29:52] virgin that's right
[1:29:57] yes so we know that this was Mary but we
[1:30:00] also know that this scripture is a
[1:30:03] compound scripture that is also speaking
[1:30:05] of an end time virgin bride amen because
[1:30:10] God sent
[1:30:13] elizer Isaac sent elizar to find a
[1:30:15] virgin Bride for his son and eliser is
[1:30:18] on the scene to find a virgin Bride for
[1:30:21] his son in this last day so virgins
[1:30:24] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[1:30:26] call his name Emmanuel means god with
[1:30:31] us or with us is
[1:30:36] God praise God so by this kind of
[1:30:40] conception the Virgin Mary conceived and
[1:30:42] brought forth God in human flesh as if
[1:30:45] should have done in the
[1:30:46] beginning no other conception could have
[1:30:49] done all could have done that and she
[1:30:51] brought forth God in flesh in male
[1:30:56] form that was the first coming of Christ
[1:30:58] and we are taught by the message of the
[1:31:00] hour that this end time bride would also
[1:31:02] be a virgin that will conceive and bring
[1:31:05] forth Christ in human flesh again amen
[1:31:09] but this time it would be Christ
[1:31:11] revealed in the flesh of many membered
[1:31:14] body
[1:31:16] Hallelujah in female form at his second
[1:31:19] coming he's coming in the form of the
[1:31:21] Bride coming of Christ in a many
[1:31:22] membered bride but got with us again in
[1:31:24] briad form not just I will be with you
[1:31:27] but I will be in
[1:31:29] you in John 14:12 it say at that day you
[1:31:33] will know that it is I in you and you in
[1:31:36] me at that day you will know that's
[1:31:39] right
[1:31:40] amen that's why in Parable Matthew 13 it
[1:31:43] was
[1:31:45] given for you to know the mystery of the
[1:31:48] Kingdom but to them it was not given
[1:31:52] that's right at that day you will know
[1:31:54] if you are a son and a daughter of God
[1:31:57] you will know oh
[1:32:01] hallelujah amen because this is not a
[1:32:05] church
[1:32:06] membership this is a body many membered
[1:32:16] body and the message choosing a
[1:32:20] bride he said the other is pregnated by
[1:32:23] the word of God now will bring forth the
[1:32:26] body the finished body of Jesus Christ
[1:32:29] which is the bride the body of Christ
[1:32:30] isn't finished yet how many knows that a
[1:32:32] man and woman is one and Christ is one
[1:32:35] body the word the bride will have to be
[1:32:38] the rest of the body and the two
[1:32:40] together make the one body again like
[1:32:43] Adam was at the beginning man and his
[1:32:46] wife are
[1:32:48] one we are one with Christ so remember
[1:32:51] that Elizabeth the old woman who
[1:32:53] represent the Pentecostal age of this
[1:32:55] church age conceive a sensation but the
[1:32:58] young virgin woman of this age who
[1:32:59] represent Mary must conceive differently
[1:33:03] that's
[1:33:04] right the end time bride in his Bri must
[1:33:07] conceive by the revelation of the word
[1:33:10] delivered by an Angel message just like
[1:33:13] Mary did amen and Mary didn't say Let It
[1:33:16] Be according to my
[1:33:19] sensation Let It Be according to the
[1:33:21] feelings that I I feel
[1:33:24] amen
[1:33:25] amen but she said be it unto me
[1:33:28] according to Thy word because the spoken
[1:33:31] word is the original
[1:33:33] seed that is why the Original Seed of
[1:33:36] the word has been given to us again in
[1:33:38] this age by an angel's message and you
[1:33:40] need a seed in order to conceive and
[1:33:44] that seed is the spoken revealed word in
[1:33:46] the hour that we are living in Praise
[1:33:48] the Lord one of the mystery of this last
[1:33:50] days was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:53] without sensation but the conception of
[1:33:55] the coming of the word of the revelation
[1:33:57] of Christ the word that I speak unto you
[1:34:00] they are spirit and they are L that's
[1:34:04] right Christ is Mystery of God revealed
[1:34:06] he said what is the new birth then this
[1:34:09] is a common quotations in many
[1:34:13] churches well Breen what is the new
[1:34:16] birth it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:34:18] Christ personally to you yes sir that is
[1:34:22] why the evidence of new bird is not
[1:34:24] based on speaking in tongues or tingling
[1:34:26] feeling of your spine or emotional
[1:34:29] experience even though at times need
[1:34:31] feelings and experience to help us along
[1:34:33] the
[1:34:35] way God uses those things so there is
[1:34:39] nothing against feelings and emotions in
[1:34:41] fact religion without some form of
[1:34:44] emotion is
[1:34:45] death but life in this hour doesn't come
[1:34:48] by feelings it comes by the revealing of
[1:34:52] the word and the over showing of the
[1:34:54] Holy Ghost
[1:34:56] amen the Bible didn't say upon this
[1:34:58] feeling I will build my church that's
[1:35:01] right about this tingling or sensation I
[1:35:03] will build my church but the word said
[1:35:06] Upon This Rock of the revelation of the
[1:35:08] word of God I will build my church
[1:35:12] Hallelujah because remember that they
[1:35:14] were sensation Pentecostal sensation
[1:35:17] loving
[1:35:20] people they love gifts and God allowed
[1:35:23] them to consume even a method just like
[1:35:25] Elizabeth and the first even it did
[1:35:27] bring forth a form of life but this last
[1:35:30] days of the bride was to be like Mary
[1:35:32] conceived
[1:35:34] differently not by gifts not by The
[1:35:37] Giver of the gift but the giver
[1:35:40] himself not just the
[1:35:43] gift but the giver of the
[1:35:46] gift just like when eliser come to
[1:35:51] Rebecca he give her a a lot of gifts
[1:35:54] from the father and they enjoy the gifts
[1:35:58] just like the Pentecostal but the time
[1:35:59] has come that he was asked the father
[1:36:02] are you willing to go to meet the Unseen
[1:36:04] bridegroom right honey he left all those
[1:36:08] gift the Pentecostal and he went with
[1:36:11] eliser to meet the Unseen
[1:36:14] bridegroom she was not
[1:36:19] satisfied about the gift he Wass The
[1:36:22] Giver of the gift that's why in this
[1:36:24] last day we are more on The Giver of the
[1:36:27] gift than the gift and The Giver is the
[1:36:30] word himself being made fles in our day
[1:36:33] that's right praise God hallelujah
[1:36:35] that's right notice the life that was in
[1:36:38] the hus in the ster in the tussel oh I I
[1:36:41] will just cut it and brother Bram said
[1:36:44] in the Masterpiece justification made a
[1:36:46] way for sanctification and
[1:36:48] sanctification made a way for the
[1:36:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:36:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost Made A Way for
[1:36:53] the Holy Ghost itself to come right down
[1:36:57] in Perfection back to the word again to
[1:37:01] manifest
[1:37:03] itself Hallelujah so we are now the
[1:37:05] Perfection of the word has come in this
[1:37:08] generation that is for the Bride of
[1:37:10] Jesus
[1:37:11] Christ trying to do a God's service
[1:37:14] without the will of God I'm going to try
[1:37:16] to finish this and just a few more
[1:37:21] quotation for but I'm not
[1:37:24] not him so this is Brother Burnham about
[1:37:28] talking about John the Baptist
[1:37:31] introducing so I will jump in in the in
[1:37:34] the next paragraph and today he is
[1:37:37] standing Among
[1:37:39] Us in the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:43] amen manifesting himself more and more
[1:37:48] coming into his church making himself
[1:37:51] known
[1:37:56] he is standing Among Us in the person of
[1:37:58] the Holy
[1:38:00] Ghost he is not standing in his Corporal
[1:38:04] body he is standing before us in the
[1:38:06] form of the Holy Ghost by the revealed
[1:38:08] word of the message of the hour you are
[1:38:11] hearing from Christ the word that was
[1:38:13] being revealed in our day that's why
[1:38:16] he's speaking when when the message is
[1:38:18] is being spoken tonight there is
[1:38:21] something in your heart that say amen
[1:38:23] for exciting something amen because it
[1:38:25] was God the Holy Ghost himself revealing
[1:38:28] himself more and more and more to the
[1:38:31] church that's why our understanding of
[1:38:34] the message growing more clearer and
[1:38:36] clearer and clearer every day praise the
[1:38:39] Lord manifesting himself more and more
[1:38:41] coming into his church making himself
[1:38:45] known because him and the bride and the
[1:38:48] groom will be the same oh Hallelujah
[1:38:51] making his known and one one day you
[1:38:54] will see that the one that you feel in
[1:38:55] your heart and see his identification
[1:38:58] will become personalized before you then
[1:39:01] you and he are
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:05] one the one that you feel in your
[1:39:09] heart sometimes you cannot understand
[1:39:11] what is pulsating in your heart when you
[1:39:13] go sometimes you you have not come into
[1:39:16] the full realization yet of who you are
[1:39:18] but there was something in your heart
[1:39:20] deep down when you are working there is
[1:39:22] something that you feel that God is
[1:39:24] calling
[1:39:26] me just like the testimony of brother
[1:39:31] Neil he is in a box leading conv nowhere
[1:39:34] to to stay but there was something
[1:39:36] pulsating in his heart maybe longing for
[1:39:39] God hallelujah he don't know about the
[1:39:42] message he don't know about God but when
[1:39:43] he pray sir God answer it he don't know
[1:39:48] what it was even even sister Sandy she
[1:39:51] is a Catholic but God has spoken to her
[1:39:54] something like something she feel in her
[1:39:56] heart and when she pray God answer her
[1:40:00] prayer God is no respector of any person
[1:40:04] that's right whatever situation you are
[1:40:06] in in this world if you are the SE of
[1:40:08] God there is a liful Satan there is a
[1:40:11] lightful Satan in your heart that you
[1:40:12] cannot understand but you feel what it
[1:40:14] is but the time has come
[1:40:17] Hallelujah that what you feel will
[1:40:19] become personalized to you and you
[1:40:21] realize who you are praise the Lord
[1:40:24] identification will become personalized
[1:40:27] before you then you and he are one
[1:40:31] that's right amen you are one with with
[1:40:34] the
[1:40:35] word because you believe his word amen
[1:40:38] you've United by the word and the Word
[1:40:42] was in the beginning will go back to the
[1:40:45] beginning which is
[1:40:47] God that's why when you are still a
[1:40:49] little babies there's something
[1:40:51] pulsating
[1:40:53] and only the bride will
[1:40:55] respond to the word because there is a
[1:40:58] deep when the Deep call you to the de
[1:41:00] there may be something to respond to the
[1:41:02] Deep that's right and if you are not a
[1:41:04] SE of God you will just reject the
[1:41:08] message just like the woman of the wells
[1:41:11] she has so many husband but when the
[1:41:12] Messiah come and show him the sign she
[1:41:15] immediately believe Thou Art the Messiah
[1:41:18] amen but those religious group when they
[1:41:20] saw the Messiah they said you are bable
[1:41:23] that's right right right but for the
[1:41:26] Bride of Jesus Christ you just say amen
[1:41:30] amen Praise You Jesus even if you are
[1:41:34] ashamed to say Amen your heart I know
[1:41:36] will say amen amen because remember this
[1:41:41] Angel was sent to your geographical
[1:41:44] location maybe your culture is So Silent
[1:41:47] Hallelujah and you still bring it into
[1:41:49] the message of the hour like was time
[1:41:52] I'm silent some are just smiling some
[1:41:54] different culture but all in all we
[1:41:57] gather together in the revealed word of
[1:41:59] God Amen thank you you're United by the
[1:42:03] word and the Word was in the beginning
[1:42:04] will go back to the beginning which is
[1:42:08] God and that day you will know I am in
[1:42:10] the Father the father in me I in you
[1:42:13] Hallelujah even the prophet was so
[1:42:16] excited Hallelujah we'll go back to the
[1:42:18] beginning and he's shouting hallelujah
[1:42:21] amen if you listen to the tape you will
[1:42:24] enjoy the anointing that comes while he
[1:42:26] was sharing this
[1:42:28] word because it was not his message it
[1:42:32] was the message inspired in your heart
[1:42:34] and he when he delivered it he himself
[1:42:37] rejoice in the message that God will s
[1:42:40] thank you
[1:42:41] Lord and that day you will know that I
[1:42:43] am the father and the father and me you
[1:42:45] you I am you and you hallelujah we're
[1:42:48] here we have arrived we're here amen
[1:42:53] don't look for him for the other
[1:42:54] generation he is
[1:42:56] here in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:58] revealing himself more and
[1:43:01] more that's why we don't go to church
[1:43:04] just to to to to to be seen we come to
[1:43:07] church to feed on the word of God we see
[1:43:09] he himself revealing himself and the
[1:43:11] more he reveal himself the
[1:43:13] more we just humble ourselves amen
[1:43:17] that's
[1:43:19] it if we will do it ourselves and we are
[1:43:22] the evidence that I am
[1:43:24] predestinated you will be boastful amen
[1:43:27] because you do it your way right but
[1:43:31] when we know that we cannot make it
[1:43:33] without the grace of God all glory go
[1:43:35] back to
[1:43:38] him I'm so glad to see
[1:43:41] him I'm so glad to see him personifying
[1:43:44] himself right among
[1:43:47] us we see what he promised for the word
[1:43:51] not what somebody emotion singing and
[1:43:54] jumping and dancing but by his word amen
[1:43:59] he is making himself
[1:44:01] known Hallelujah not by an emotion
[1:44:04] praise God but by revealing it through
[1:44:06] the word of God so our conception as the
[1:44:09] Virgin bride of Christ for this end time
[1:44:11] hour must come by the revelation of the
[1:44:14] truth of the word that has been spoken
[1:44:16] to us by the angel that has appeared in
[1:44:20] our day that's right it cannot come
[1:44:23] based on deception and unbelief some
[1:44:25] hybrid word teaching of previous age
[1:44:27] that was the eve and Elizabeth represent
[1:44:30] but we are in the bright
[1:44:35] age as the prophet said here is the
[1:44:37] secret of this the word is in the bride
[1:44:40] as it was in
[1:44:42] Mary how was the word of this hour in
[1:44:44] Mary how did she get the word in her
[1:44:46] then how did she conceive by that
[1:44:49] method good question
[1:44:53] H how did she get the word in her and
[1:44:56] then how did she conceive by that
[1:44:59] method remember that Mary actually
[1:45:03] became physically pregnant just by
[1:45:05] receiving the Angel's
[1:45:08] message amen amen it didn't happen for
[1:45:12] almost 40 or 4,000 years and that method
[1:45:15] of getting pregnant had never been seen
[1:45:18] before 4,000 years of human existence
[1:45:20] that's right
[1:45:25] unbelievable how could a virgin conceive
[1:45:28] by just the spoken word of an angel's
[1:45:32] message think about
[1:45:37] that even Joseph could handle that idea
[1:45:40] and he was going to put Mary away privil
[1:45:42] so it was very hard for anyone to accept
[1:45:44] back then and that is why also very hard
[1:45:47] for people to accept the same thing
[1:45:50] today we need to have some sensation
[1:45:55] to prove our new
[1:45:57] birth but this exact same thing is
[1:46:00] promised to repeat again in this last
[1:46:02] day because the new birth of this bright
[1:46:03] a is promised to come by visitation and
[1:46:06] Revelation from an angel and is so
[1:46:09] different of how women the church would
[1:46:12] usually
[1:46:13] conceive amen and then this new age
[1:46:16] Revelation brother told us that we can
[1:46:18] have the previous Pentecostal experience
[1:46:20] of the Holy Ghost baptism every our life
[1:46:22] and and still be
[1:46:26] lost and he said notice we find that
[1:46:29] people there's many just can't believe
[1:46:31] it even Spirit-filled
[1:46:33] people I'm going to give you one that
[1:46:35] will choke
[1:46:37] you that will maybe
[1:46:40] some to stumble
[1:46:44] you because if you are not ordained to
[1:46:50] believe you will turn back about faith
[1:46:54] and
[1:46:55] go you cannot receive
[1:46:58] it that will choke you the baptism of
[1:47:01] the host do mean that you're going in
[1:47:03] not all not on that don't have anything
[1:47:05] to do with your soul remember in that
[1:47:07] Spirit you can be baptized with the
[1:47:09] genuine spirit of God and still be lost
[1:47:11] it's the soul that Liv that was ordained
[1:47:13] of God
[1:47:16] right that's so much different from what
[1:47:19] denomination yeah understanding remember
[1:47:21] that this terminology baptism of the
[1:47:24] Holy ghosts has a very wide
[1:47:28] application because we use this term to
[1:47:30] mean both the rain which is the spirit
[1:47:33] of the genuine Holy Spirit falling on a
[1:47:35] person's Spirit LM and also sometime we
[1:47:38] call it that is our new
[1:47:40] birth right but we have since them
[1:47:43] thought by the message of the hour that
[1:47:44] the new birth of this age is different
[1:47:47] to the Rain baptism of the Pentecostal
[1:47:49] age because you can have the rain
[1:47:51] baptism every day of your life and still
[1:47:53] be lost right but you cannot receive the
[1:47:56] revelation of the seed word of God in
[1:47:58] your heart and ever be
[1:48:01] lost that's right because that word when
[1:48:04] watered by the holy spirit is what
[1:48:06] Quicken you to eternal life because my
[1:48:09] word they are spirit and they are
[1:48:11] life
[1:48:14] Hallelujah in the message the future
[1:48:16] home that's what I that's what we were
[1:48:18] talking the other day the evidence of
[1:48:20] the Holy Ghost see the evidence of the
[1:48:21] Holy Ghost when you can receive the word
[1:48:24] of God Amen the word when you can
[1:48:27] receive that's the only
[1:48:29] evidence not the evidence of you're
[1:48:32] trying to do to be perfect
[1:48:34] no we have so many failures but it
[1:48:38] doesn't mean that you are not son and
[1:48:40] daughters of
[1:48:42] God and I said a while ago all our
[1:48:45] failures are permitted by God that's why
[1:48:47] when brother R preach about the wrong
[1:48:49] will always turn right yeah because that
[1:48:53] is
[1:48:54] predestination God allow
[1:48:56] everything so the evidence of the Holy
[1:48:59] Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:00] when you can receive the word in First
[1:49:03] Peter 1:23 said being born again not of
[1:49:07] corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by
[1:49:11] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[1:49:16] forever so the new birth of this bright
[1:49:18] hour comes by the seed of the revealing
[1:49:21] of the word of this hour that what why
[1:49:22] only the elect can be truly born again
[1:49:26] because they are the only one with the
[1:49:28] capacity to receive the word and the
[1:49:31] prophet said in none seed there is
[1:49:33] nothing to
[1:49:35] Quicken Hallelujah only those who are
[1:49:38] seed can be reborn in N there is nothing
[1:49:41] to Quicken amen what a special people
[1:49:44] you are praise the Lord thank you J you
[1:49:47] are not a guest work that's right an
[1:49:51] angel of sent from the realm amen of
[1:49:54] heaven and found wherever you
[1:49:58] are thank you
[1:50:00] Lord although we still have our cultural
[1:50:04] manifestation sometime
[1:50:06] but doesn't really change what's what in
[1:50:09] the mind of God before the foundation of
[1:50:12] in the message me and age in every age
[1:50:15] and every age is the age of the Holy
[1:50:16] Ghost for the True Believer I say in
[1:50:19] every age the evess was the same
[1:50:22] those who had the spirit the teacher
[1:50:24] heard the word and the spirit in them
[1:50:26] took the word and taught it revealed it
[1:50:28] to them and they were of the group that
[1:50:30] heard the messenger and his message and
[1:50:32] took it and leave it amen amen so we can
[1:50:35] see that the
[1:50:36] evidence is receiving the word so we'll
[1:50:40] go back
[1:50:42] to the question how did she receive
[1:50:46] it so in the message the spoken word is
[1:50:50] the Original Seed say and the only way
[1:50:53] that we can ever be born again is first
[1:50:57] in the womb of the
[1:50:59] Mind am in our mind receive the word
[1:51:04] then the spirit comes on top of that and
[1:51:07] brings it and there you are amen that's
[1:51:10] how you conceive the word of God it must
[1:51:12] come into the Mind first receive the
[1:51:16] word and the spirit comes on top of that
[1:51:18] and brings it there you are that's what
[1:51:20] it does that's the real Go goel teaching
[1:51:23] brother I believe if St Paul was
[1:51:25] standing today he' this the same thing
[1:51:27] Amen in this
[1:51:29] hour not Mary's womb the physical mind
[1:51:34] was virgin womb

[1:51:40] how much anybody criticized how many
[1:51:43] things somebody else said that didn't
[1:51:45] have one thing to do with it she
[1:51:48] believed God's word
[1:51:51] regardless and only you as a message
[1:51:54] Believers a bride of
[1:51:57] Christ can receive the message that was
[1:52:00] sent in your
[1:52:02] age we ought to be
[1:52:04] grateful no matter how many trials Mary
[1:52:08] was criticized persecuted but she
[1:52:16] believed not Mar's womb the physical
[1:52:18] mind was virgin womb why she believed
[1:52:20] God's word no matter how much anybody
[1:52:22] cre how many things somebody else said

[1:52:30] irregardless amen oh I wish I could just
[1:52:33] get that over are you getting
[1:52:35] it first was her mind before the act
[1:52:39] ever taken place in her literal womb
[1:52:43] that's why Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:52:45] that hearing by the word of God only and
[1:52:49] you cannot hear the word unless you are
[1:52:51] part of the word of
[1:52:55] God because there is something in you
[1:52:58] that will respond to that c and that is
[1:53:01] the evidence that you are part of the
[1:53:03] word of God thank you Lord and that ever
[1:53:07] taking place in her little W the ACT had
[1:53:09] to take place in her first to let the

[1:53:14] work first you need to receive the word
