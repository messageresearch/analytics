song offering amen are you glad to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen it's like what King David said I'm so glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord so in times of trouble in times of uh trials we have a place of Refuge that we can find rest and that is in the word of God Amen out there there the spirit is so depressing you can see a lot of homeless people a lot of uh things that will affect our spirit but in within the house of the Lord we can have an atmosphere and sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen that is the word of God so uh the last service that I have I preach about the he is risen but I haven't finished it so this morning it seems that I will not finish it still because God gave me another Direction amen and I trust that it will be a blessing to each and every one of us amen we are living in the most glorious age that's right Hallelujah so turn with me in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 25 verse 5-6 theonomy it's a hard to pronounce are you excited this morning amen yeah amen so if you are excited I'm excited it can help me when you say you are excited amen I I I I get my strength from you amen because if you just look at me I will be so nervous but if you smile you say Amen it will encourage me amen it will help me amen as I always say it is always two-way right amen you are not just an audience spectator but you are part A participator amen I am just a waiter waiting for your order and willing to serve amen amen Deuteronomy 25 verse 5-6 it says if if Brethren dwell together and one of them die and have no child the wife of the Dead shall not marry without unto a stranger her husband's brother shall go in unto her and take her to him to wife and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her and it shall be that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead that his name be not put out of Israel it says if the husband of a woman dies then the nearest Kinsman of her husband is to bring resurrection of the name and the family of his Dead Brother by marriage and by seed amen because marriage and seed is what brings forth a family and a race of people and even a nation so second uh scripture 1 Corinthians chap 15 verse 21- 22 for it says for sins by men Came Death by men came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive amen so let us bow again once again father we ask you Lord to anoint the word that we read we can open the Bible we can read it Lord but it will take your Holy Spirit to give us understanding yes and may you bless bless the word in Jesus Christ's name amen amen so you may be seated this morning so my title is uh Redemption by marriage and the is resurrection by Union and by seed so we know that the seed are a very powerful thing they come in many different form and without seed there is no continuation of life right because seed is a continuation continuous life and resurrect life when a plant dies it as a resurrection by the seed that is in itself amen and because of that it rises again the next spring and all of that are familiar with that amen anything that is not living by the word is not living because life can only exist by the word of God just like Timothy 56 he said but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she is alive so without the word of God without the seed of God you are not really living the life and the word of God is the seed of God so outside of the word you cannot continue to live in Genesis 1:1 speaks of uh the seed will bring forth of its kind because that is what continues life and brings Resurrection is because of the seed that is within let every seed bring forth of its kind no so John 663 said it is the SP spirit that quickeneth the flesh Propet it nothing right the word that I speak unto you they are spirit and there are life so without the word even though you are living you are still dead in the sight of God so the word of God which is the seed of God contains spirit and life of God and if that word is in you you cannot fail but to rise again because the seed of God is in you so there is a word coming out let every seed bring forth of its kind so the seed has a transforming power and if you are the seed of God even though you fail amen you fail you can still rise up because the power within the seed will rise up let every seed bring force of its kind amen so if you are the seed of God you will overcome all the obstacles in life Hallelujah Lord so the seed is the life carrier and without seed there is no life and no Resurrection so brother bham types the denominational as a rotten egg because they don't have any seed in the message the super saan that's the way with our organization religion until they come in contact with the mate Jesus Christ there AB band of rotten eggs the whole thing needs to be thrown out of the nest they'll never hatur and the best thing to do is clean out the nest and start all over again get the mate Christ Jesus so before you can have a resurrection of New Life there must be first a union and a seed combination and Resurrection is not an event Resurrection is a person so you need to know the person be be before you can enter into the event just like John 11: 2124 so you don't need to open your Bible just we we have a overhead just for the sake of time in J uh about Lazarus and they're looking and the family of blz looking for Jesus to come and then Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou Hast been here my brother had not died so he believed in Jesus Christ because he saw his ministry all the Miracles and all the healing and the campaign he believed in Jesus Christ that's why he said if if if if thou H has been here my brother had not died he believe it but I know he said but I know that even now whatsoever will ask of God God will give it unto thee she believe him amen she has a confidence in him and Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again hallelujah amen amen amen it gives a consolation but Martha has a different thinking and he thought that Resurrection was an event and it is a future time Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again he believed in the resurrection as an event right I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and many believe also the message of the hour I know the message of the hour I read the spoken word I heard the message of the hour I saw the picture I saw but they don't really know the message of the hour but they believe just like Martha I believe Jesus Christ if you my brother will not die but I know that even now whatsoever th will ask of God God will give it unto thee he has a confidence in him amen and Jesus said unto my brother shall rise what a consolation he will rise and Mara said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last days but Jesus said uh Jesus in verse 25 and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet he shall live so Resurrection is a person before it will be an event you need to know Jesus Christ as a person of the Resurrection before the event will take place in your life amen hallelujah it is not the Ben in the future tense but it is right now if you believe in me hallelujah amen he in me though he were dead yet he shall live Hallelujah Christ is the word and he's the only one that carries the Original Seed of the original life and he is the life Bearer amen so if there's any life especially eternal life then there must be of necessity be seed Associated praise God with that life CU see in the Garden of Eden in the in the book of the beginning death came by Adam rais by a false Union and a hybrid seed so therefore Resurrection can only return to Adam's Race by true Union with Christ and by receiving the Original Seed of the original life again Hallelujah Resurrection by Union and by sin that's why in our opening scripture if Brethren dwells together and one of them die and have no child the wife of the Dead shall not marry without a stranger he will not marry somebody else her husband's brother should shall go in unto her and take her to him wife and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her and it shall be that the firstborn which she buth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead that his name be not put out of Israel Hallelujah God is so good he because if the first husband a woman dies then the nearest Kinsman is to bring a resurrection of the name of the family of his Dead Brother by marriage and by seed because marriage and seed is what brings forth a race of people this is a prophecy in these last days in the book of Exodus in verse 32 chapter 32:10 now therefore let me alone that my wrath may walk hot against them that I may consume them and I will make of thee a great nation God is so with the brilliant people God is in his Ro was going to wipe out the Jewish race and resurrect that race again by Moses seed a resurrection by seed this is the principle of the Bible because God has a pattern and never changes word it never changes pattern we may have different season different ages but the pattern is still the same that's why we can say the same yesterday today and forever if we can see praise God the pattern in the Old Testament we can see he was going it praise God in the in the New Testament because he is the Alpha and the Omega when he started he's going to achieve Amen in the last days so we see the pattern is typ throughout the stories of the Bible in the book of Bruth and we know in the book of Bruth praise God there's only four chapter and the Book of Bruth when elex no husband died it takes boas brings a resurrection and a restoration to the family and the the lineage of IMC by uniting with Ruth in a marriage and Union by giving her seed in 1 Samuel chapter 25 we see that nabal Abigail's first husband died then she was United in marriage with David during the time of his exil before he was made King over Israel Abigail had two son the first one was called Kad which means like his father and Tamar also praise God received seed after her husband died and Rahab the Gentile Harlot received seed by Salon praise God after she heard the message of the hour in times of judgment and brought forth the lineage of King David and the son of David all these stories in the Bible are revealing something to us about this Great Harvest Time and Resurrection time that we are now living in because the marriage of the Lamb is come am amen hallelujah this is the season that we are living in now Christ has also opened to us the entire mystery of the seed of the entire Bible in order to release the full potency of his Original Seed at this time to cause a resurrection to take place in this hour amen how will it take place by Union and by seed and this is the life of immortality so we know that it is Christ the second Adam that brings about the resurrection in this hour of the Bride of the seventh Church ages because of a people in this day that come into a union with him and that have received the fullness of his seed of his original word again amen so the word is being restored so how does the restoring take place this hour by marriage and by Union by The Original Seed of the word of God being restored to us again in its fullness we don't have any part word in these last days the full word was being restored in these last days amen we don't have the message just sanctification or justification we have the fullness of the word in this last days the fullness of Christ the seed word of God it is the life and the voice of the seed of the revealed word that is calling our name in this hour that is what will produce the resurrection in this hour the word of God that is being given unto us in the book of Bruth we see this portrayed in the prophecy for this time that we are now living in because imc's household all died the Original Seed was lost IMC died his son died praise God God but because El Li's household all died and the Original Seed was lost and that was Adam's Fallen race but boas by marriage Union and by seed raised up the house of IMC again which is the type of Christ so in the book of Bru chapter 4 verse 2-5 and he took 10 men of the Elders of the city and said sit ye down here and they sat down he's going to pronounce amen just like Revelation 5 all the 24 ERS are sitting behind the throne and and Christ praying the price of redemption takes the book with a name in it and give it to the seventh angel in Revelation 10 to speak it out to the church so he gathered all the elders as a witness what is going and he said unto the kingsman neomi that is come again out of the country of Moab and sell it parel of land which was our brother imix and I thought to advertise this saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the Elders of the people if thou wil redeem it redeem it right but if thou will not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and I am up after thee and he said I will redeem it it's this like of Satan he always trying to to be our Kinsman but when given a chance to redeem us he will not he will just come and destroy amen but he will not take side with you amen it was going to cause him to redeem back with eliminate loss that would that was going to spoil his own wealth because the son of Bruth would go on to inhibit it for a limic family's name yes amen then verse five then boas what day thou buyest the field of the of the hand of noi thou must buy it also of Bruth the moabites the wife of the Dead to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance so boas was a type of Christ who was prepared to have his own inheritance marred in order to bring Resurrection to Adam's Fallen race and the kingsman said I cannot redeem it for myself lest I Mar my own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for I cannot redeem it so to be the part of Resurrection in the first day that we are living in you must first come into Union with Christ and receive the seed of the revelation of the original word of God again am you cannot be in the resurrection without receiving the word of God again in this last days especially the revealed word of God because God uh God came down praise God and used Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 and reveal this divinely mystery truth that will turn literally turn our heart back to the father thank you so to be the part of the first rest in this day that we are living in you must first come into Union with Christ the revealed word and received the seed of the revelation of the original word of God again for seven Church ages the seed of God came in portion for its age through the messenger for each age of the seven Church ages and by that portion of the word it gave them life to fulfill the work of God for their day amen God only gave a portion of word in each Church age and they are God's coworker they are not working with God they are a coworker because it was God through them work his will unto them amen we are not working but we are a coworker because was Christ in you doing the work amen a porable word is enough for them in the time of Luther the just live Faith that's is enough for them amen in time of wday sanctification it's enough for them in the day of Pentecost restoration of the that's enough for them but in our day it was be the fullness of the word of God in this last days not only a portion not only you are Justified and Sanctified baptized with the Holy Ghost but it is the Holy Ghost himself in the person living through you God is working through you so that's why you become a coworker you become a priest and King in the sight of God and a priest always present the people people to God while the prophet present God to the people so why as a priest praise God we mediate Upon Our beloveds amen we mediate upon the people we become an intercessor we become a a a mediator we are standing in the Gap with our people because we are presenting the people to God where are the prophet are presenting God to the people Amen in the Old Testament when the when the worshipper bring a sacrifice was the PRI that will bring the sacrifice into the presence of God and if the the priest is worthy then he will turn back and all those Believers or worshippers praise God feel relief but when the priest is entering they are in constant Battle Is My Sacrifice be accepted if my sacrifice be worthy they are in great fear maybe the priest is not worthy but when the priest coming out and bring the sacrifice they feel will but in our day different we have now access and boldness to enter into the Throne of God Amen because we are Redeemed by the blood of God and our Redemption is irreversible even though how much trial and testing it cannot be reversed Hallelujah although Satan will put something in you praise God this is not worthy this is not something this is not this is not but the blessing is irreversible praise the Lord sir praise God Amen we will suffer the consequences of what we did but the blessing is irreversible amen that's why we have a genuine repentance and there are fake repent repentance genuine repentance are willing to accept the consequences of his mistake just like the prodigal son he was a son but he is willing to accept the consequences as he's willing to become a servant instead of a son but a fake repentance is somebody who repent apologize but no remorse right right always blaming others for the mistake that he had done and even asking people to take side with their mistakes they repent but that is fake repentance but a genuine repentance is willing to accept whatever consequences that comes their way Amen brother and when they repent genuinely God is faithful to forgive their sin thank you Lord amen amen amen hallelujah so in each say they have a portion of the Original Seed but in this last day it must be the entire seed that comes together in Union with the people a church in order to produce the literal resurrection of 2,000 years of sleeping Saints in this hour they are looking for us we have the full word so we don't have any excuse amen in the time of the Reformation they believe the message but they still have sinned so that's why God act as an intercessor a mediator for their ignorance but in this last day he come not as an intercessor but he come as a judg amen so there is judgment at the same time there is comfort in the land amen so in Genesis 4:25 Adam knew his wife again and he bear a son and called his name Seth for God said she had appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew Seth was a type of Christ Resurrection in the Ming infallible proof of the Resurrection then when he slew AB he thought he got it because he destroyed the only righteous part of the seed then God rais up set to take his place a beautiful Ty of the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ amen hallelujah so even Isaac was also one received from the dead because he came by the Seed of Abraham so notice in the beginning death came by a FSE Union of a wrong seed that was received in the womb of the woman the verse is so therefore life can only come back by the right Union and the right seed of the original word back in the womb of a woman again so death came by a hybrid seed of the serpent seed but we know all the stories about it God praise God allow it to happen in order to express his attributes amen nothing happens by chance everything praise God is for the glory of God so that's why everything that happens in our lives God has already ordered it even he said that every footstep of the righteous men are ordered arranged by God even your trial and your trusting are ordered and arranged by God he know your weaknesses he knows the what do you want he know what what's good for you so that's why he put something in you because he knows and ordain it for you to mold your character into His Image nothing is by chance so whatever trial you are in right now it seems like it get so dark Nothing by chance I have no right to overcome no God said he that Hearth my word shall overcome amen you can only overcome by the word of God nothing else not by your strength and your power but by your spirit but by the word of God because Faith cometh by hearing and that hearing by the word the word that was revealed in our day it was Christ in you the hope of glory so that's why don't that's why Paul said think it not strange that you fall into diverse man think it not strange sometimes we wonder why why is so trial so as if as if trial is so strange I am saved that I being punished I saved why do this every time I do good there always everybody can relase about that but praise God for the message of the hour everything is put in order amen hallelujah nothing is by chance nothing is by accident everything is by by by by by predestination and predestination not only your being God your trials and your testing also predestinated for you and to overcome is also predis it's a package deal amen because he is the Alpha and the Omega and in between that's your package amen your trial or sickness your sickness your trials praise God sometimes some of us will fall into depression anxiety nervousness all sickness that is your package deal that's why he said in Psalm 103 remember thy benefits don't forget your benefits because God hallelujah is our healer that's right and forget don't forget your benefits amen am don't lock in your door closet and cry and have P party the word of God said remember thy benefits amen he healed you he lift you up Hallelujah he comforter you amen you're healer comforter deliverer miracle workers everything that you need is already in his word don't come into your closet and have a py party and cry and cry and don't don't have time to eat and walk no no you need to rise up I am a Son of God I am the daughter of God I am a Son of God yes I have trouble yes I have testing yes but I still the Son of God when you are a son of God doesn't mean that you don't have immune to the to the tri and testing yo you are a son of God that's why when the when Jesus Christ was baptized in the Jordan River the first thing that the Satan do is temp him he will not temp you if you if he he know that you are not a son of God after his baptism he was tempted because Satan knows that he was a Son of God he identified him this is my beloved Son in whom I well pleased to dwell in and Satan temp him because he recognized him to be the Son of God right so if you are the son of God he will temp you because he recognize that you are a son of God praise the Lord he all is testing and he said and he command you if you are the Son of God command the stone to take bread he is not telling him but he's commanding him because Satan know that he was a commander right so he command him to turn the stone into bread so he's commanding the commander because the commander he knows that he Jesus Christ is the bread of life so that's why he turned his St into bread because Jesus Christ was the bread of life he command him to turn the toone into AB bread because the commander is sitting Satan know how to address with respect thank you Lord that's why even though you have in trial he still respect you that you are Sons or Daughters of God Amen he will not tempt you beyond your capacity to overcome because as the Paul said no one no no trial can come our ways that we cannot overcome he already overcome it so if you overcome it you need to shake yourself don't despair Hallelujah sometimes we we we we sometimes we lost our Focus that we are sons and Daughters of God remember that we are sons of God when the seven seal was open in this last day it was not an accident what is the purpose of opening of the Seven Seals to reveal himself to you to tell you that he loves you even before the foundation of the word praise the Lord and if he loves you not as denominational think love was pting in your shoulder amen say good things but the love of God is with chastisement he will chastise you every Sons and Daughters of God that comes with he will be chastised amen because God's love us so that's why he corrected us amen so in the message there is only one way provided by God for anything so this title is always a declaration a prophet don't come and just preach A good sermon a prophet is a mouthpiece of God so everything that comes out of his mouth is a declaration there's only one way provid Ed by God for anything he said God promised this church a scriptural sign small letter C he said Resurrection would be reproduced Jesus Christ and his Capital C Church would become so they'd be one so there is a scriptural sign praise God he said rest ction would be reproduced and Jesus Christ and his Capital C church not the William Bram Tabernacle Church not the evening light Tabernacle Church but a church mean in Greek word eclesia which means the C out one so in this last days in this evil age God called us out of this Darkness out of this evil age not only called us out praise God but he has chosen us he elected us he selected us praise God he separated us he justified us he Sanctified us he glorified us it is already done we just need to recognize that God do everything for you and me it is not for somebody else when the seven seal was open it was not directed for anybody else that's right when he resurrected the day of his resurrection he didn't go to a public speaking anymore he didn't go to the big gatherings of the Parise and seduces he didn't go to a very significant place just like Nazareth but said I'm going to meet you in Galilee there is a specific place where God can meet us in this last days and that is in the blood of Jesus Christ not in any certain places but a special place which is the revealed word of the hour the chosen place of worship of God is in the revealed word of the hour no other else that's why when he resurrect praise God he specifically went to his disciple not anybody else and the first one who know that he was resurrected was Mary a woman which is a type of the church right and he went and tell his disciple he is risen he is risen but they did but they they they did they believe her no they recognized that there was an empty tomb but they didn't believe her that's right then all the disciple went to the tomb and Ste the he was not here but they still don't believe her right so that's why the message of the hour Hallelujah it takes Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit personally to reveal to you this message because New Birth is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ you cannot get the Revelation by by our pastor by whosoever Ministry whosoever but it take the spirit of God praise God who will reveal himself to you that's why when he resurrected he opened the understanding about the scripture he point them he is R he he he he is not here because he is risen according to what he said so he's pointing them to the scripture that's right am then he confirmed the scripture to them because when he walked with the man in the Mayo what are you so sad about did you know you are Stranger in this country you don't know what happened and we know all we all know about the scripture and he said and he open the word of God beginning Moses unto his time he opening the scripture when the seven seal was open his opening scripture to us amen and the understanding it take the Holy Spirit to give us the understanding of the scripture that's why Martha said I believe you Lord I believe in the resurrection but he don't know about the person of the Resurrection so it take Jesus Christ himself to declare I am the resurrection and the life and whosoever beli me although he dead but he will be alive the same like wasse in our day it takes the holy spirit of God to reveal to you the mystery that's right no amount of Education no amount of studying praise God no amount of anything can understand the word of God except the spirit of God remember the word of God was written as they were inspired by the holy spirit so if it is inspired by the Holy Spirit no one can understand it except you have the spirit of Christ in you so when the spirit of the inspir of scripture is in you you will understand what he is writing about likewise the S seal is thank you Lord hallelujah the the S seal was open in our day and in our age God promised this church a scriptural sign he said Resurrection would reproduce Jesus Christ and his church amen yes sir put an emphasis in it capital c his church not only a small Church denominational churches but a Capital C A church this is his personal choice the C out one Hallelujah is Beloved the elected one Hallelujah would become so they would be one in the last days you and the word will become one as you receive the word you become one with a word that's why when the seventh seal was open praise God to take the book John and eat it there is an action take the book John and eat it and thou must prophesy again right he was not telling John to preach but he was telling John to prophesy that's right so that's why in these last days we have a prophetic Ministry remember L this year chapter chapter 3 that the door was already closed and they need to overcome in order for an open door in chapter four you can only overcome in this last day through the hearing of the word that was sent in your day no other age you cannot overcome any other age except the word that was sent in your day so you need to overcome into in order to be live up to an Open Door in Revelation chapter 4 and God showed John the things that was which is and is to come that is a prophetic Ministry that's why in this last day there is a slow accelerations of the growth because we are now in the Harvest time we need to lay in the presence of the Lord in this last day evangelism is already done amen it is already done by Ora Robert bile Graham when they preach thousand and thousand receive Christ but we are now in the Harvest Time there is a a slot accelerations of we are not to evangelize I have tried to evangelize but we can see the effect is not is different from the Ty amen God is only gleaning one there one there two there four there is no no more multiple God is a we need to growth and we need to prophesy again and the prophetic Ministry is only for the Bride of Jesus Christ the things that he has done the things that he is doing and the things that he's going to do that's why we know everything that happens in this world the things in the past the present tense that he's doing right now and the thing that he is continue to do that is the prophetic Ministry we need to establish ourselves in the word of God Amen no more Sensations no more Hallelujah no more singing or jumping or emotional no we need to be established in the word of God know our position if you know our position then praise God you can do a greater works because you know who you are the days of emotional something it is good you can still feel it you can still enjoy crying but that is not the main focus of the word of God the main focus is to recognize your day and your message that's why there is a message the prophet said he decare it you need to recognize your day and your message that is a declaration that is a command you need to recognize Hallelujah who are they you are not just a church member another organization you need to recognize that you are a Sons and Daughters of God that is the very Pur purpose that God opened the seal to let us know that our name is in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah and that seal Hallelujah is calling our name by showing us the mystery of who we are in this last days we are part of God right when we say we are a part of God don't look at your flesh that's right because your flesh will always discourage you he will always tell you are not worthy how can you become a Son of God you are not worthy you cannot mistake you think something different how can you claim that you are sons of God but nevertheless we need to recognize that we are sons of God that's right flesh H has nothing to do with who we are flesh will become flesh he will be rotten one of these days that why there will there will be a changing of our bodies one of these days because the SE must be quickened there is a transforming power that he will control our spirit and he will control our [Music] flesh how can you control your spirit and control your your flesh if you're not eating in the word of God you can never overcome by your strength by your knowledge you need to overcome by recognizing whose seed you are in these last days hallelujah because when the seven seal was open the seven Thunder uttered the voices John who was in the a of badmos I don't know where he get his pen but when the seven tenders after the voices he was about to write we don't know where he get his pen but I believe in was thrown into the AL Patmos he requested give me a pen that I will write my diary my experience in pmos amen so everything happens in our life Hallelujah is not by accident maybe he is not conscious about the pen but God has something for him when it was open I was about to write he was so enjoy it he has a pen in his hand Hallelujah ready to write but the word of God said don't write it joh seal the word because it will be given to the seven Church ages messenger in last days but when the messenger of Our Last Days come in the same holy spirit that tell John don't write it in the same holy spirit that tell brother take your pen and write it Hallelujah and he said one night I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write one J was forbid to write here is the prophet last day take up the pen and write this is the message of the hour take the pen and write Hallelujah so I grabbed the pen to write the spirit gave me a message for the church Hallelujah this is the message for the church and I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride amen the mystery of God is being revealed in this last days amen here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that his species bring forth of his kind remember in the Book of Genesis when God created the Heaven and the earth and the second verse and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the earth and the verse three and the spirit of God move upon the face of the water and he said let there be light let there be a permanent Let There Be A Way let there be a fall let there be a bird but when it comes to the seed he said let every seed bring forth to its kind he doesn't say let there be a seed because the seed was already in the ground the seed was already in you before the foundation of the world that's why when the message of God it just Quicken the SE which is in you Hallelujah he didn't say Let There Be se he said he let there be SE no let every sin bring for to be Sky there is already a transforming power in the Sin which is in you and Christ the in the message God who is rich in Mercy when he when you are still a little baby confused in darkness that seed was already in you hallelujah hallelujah while you're grouping in darkness the seed was already in you laying in there for how many years maybe you jump from one Church to another trying to find what is that se but one day Hallelujah the the word light of God Quicken that se and you recognize that you are not what you are you are what God wants you to be you are the sons and daughters of God as brother I am now become a new chch andam you are not an ordinary people maybe you're wandering from one Church to another but the seed of God was already in you let every seed bring forth of his kind the seed didn't come to you when you receive the message of the the seed was already in you and when the SE message of the Hour come it just Quicken the seed which is in come and say praise the Lord Praise Lord if you are not a seed of God you will not respond to the message of the hour because only the seed will response to the message of the hour the law of reproduction is that each spey bring forth after its kind each spey what spey are you I'm sure you are not a denominational species you're not a Baptist species you're not a Catholic species but every seed of God if you are the seed of God you will manifest God whether you like it or not because the light of the message of the hour is already shown when the word of God said let there be light it Quicken the seed and brings life and joy to the seed but for the stone it say oh it hurts it's so hot just like in penix oh we have 100° but when the seed was hit by the Light of the word it just quickened and rejoice I know Hallelujah I Am Redeemed by the blood of God and know one can liberate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus even continue thank you even according to Genesis 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring forth of its kind and Herb yelding seed and fruit yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself amen if you are the seed of God amen it is not a big problem for you to manifest the fruit just believe it because the fruit is already in the seed even though he is in the SE form but the potential of the fruit was already in his and God said nobody got said that not the Pastor said not the prophet said but it was God who said it let every seed bring forth of its kind amen that's why the Holy Spirit say take your pen and write it amen when you are in uh examination when you review your examination better to write it so that you can remember don't memorize it oh I got it I got it I got it I got it but you when you come into the the actual event you forgot everything that's why God is so gracious thank you pen and write it it is good for us that we can read what the Holy Spirit inspired the prophet so that we will not forget who we are we are Sons and Daughters of God what a privileged people amen don't look at yourself always looking at ourselves is the is the thing that Satan enjoy so much oh he look at it so he was enjoying it so that's why when he he knew that Jesus Christ with the Son of God behold the voice of God said behold the Son of God in whom I am well pleased immediately there he is going to Temp him so that's why if you press to be a chisan if you profess to be sons and make sure you have the revelation of Who You Are [Music] not only believing because you believe for how many months or some maybe how many years but when the times have come the testing is so heavy they just back out from who they claim they are right but if you know who you are Satan come on Satan came on Satan as the prophets you if you know who you are you can defeat Satan anytime anywhere any place because the Son of God the word of God is already in you Lord but expect trials and testing that is good for us thank you at the moment sometimes it's so hard but when you continue to move on you realize that you are an overcome amen you will enjoy it amen GL to God God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit yelding fruit after his guy whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into Fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in the last days the true right church with the parenthesis Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super church superv as he nears him they in the bride the bride will be so much like him that they will be even in his very image that was the Holy Spirit that inspired brother Bram to write it it is written directly for you and I am praise the Lord she will come to The Headstone whether you like it or not it is already being spoken it is already being dust say the Lord whether you like it you will come into the headstone which is Christ whether you like it or not in order to enjoy me better to come into and subject yourself and humble yourselves in the presence of God lord I can do nothing Within Myself my ambition is nothing my my my career is nothing let me be Lord identified as your sons and daughters of God Amen because he promised seek you first the kingdom of God and all these things that you need your carrier your work and everything will be added unto you but seek ye first the kingdom which is the word of God the revealed word of the hour and he said God will supply all your needs according to the witches of his glory praise Lord and he is willing to prosper you praise God Amen not only in the flesh but in your spirit so don't worry too much about these early things as Brother Martin said that communism CP into to the church we want to become like what somebody else look at if the Jonas act like this I want to be like the Jonas if they have the car like this I want to be have a car like this if they have a house like this I want to become like this no just like Abraham I'm looking for a city whose Builders and maker is God that is the thing that we are need to concern about not what somebody else said somebody else said will always fail don't mold yourself by what somebody else said that's mold your character according to what the word of God said Hallelujah not what somebody else right they may talk about you something El no if they are Sons and Daughters of God they will not talk something bad about you they will encourage you so you will know your true friend if circumstances comes your way you will know your true friend your true friend will encourage you you will lift you up in time of your needs and Times of your trouble they will come and comfort you amen it's true not like the friend of job he thought that his friend was his best friend but when trials and Come Those he consider his best friend are the one who accus him of being a secret sinner that's not true friend Hallelujah who is your true friend no other than the Lord Jesus Christ because he promised I will never leave you nor forsake you your friend this world will forsake and in times of trouble they will forsake you that's right when you have a lot of money you have a lot of friend but if you don't have money you don't have friend this is what the word is but when you serve God whether you have money or not God will provide everything for you God knows what he's done amen that's that when you have too much money he will correct you that's enough you will become so worldly so a thought come to my mind that they said if you ask anything in my name I will do it just don't ask to win a lotto when you ask anything sometimes when we ask anything sometimes we become discouraged because what we ask didn't God didn't answer he said I will do it he didn't say immediately but he will do it we need to recognize whatever God said and we asked in his name he will do it but he never said I will do it immediately or in three in the next day I will do it whether it takes how many days how many month how many years when he promised Abraham I will make you a part of many nations Abraham waited 25 years but Abraham didn't stagger the promise of God through unbelief he waited for 25 years knowing if God said it God is faithful to do it hallelujah amen because God answer sometimes yes sometimes no and sometimes wait but he answered amen amen Noah waited 420 years but he enjoyed it because he heard the voice build the ark he just build it and build it and build it until the ark was became manifested he did dis he was not discouraged until he see that the prophecy was being fulfilled in his day being made manifest that said we we will not we will will not stop until the word of God that what is said that the manifestation of Sons and Daughters of God will take effect in our day amen right you see all over the news the climate change the tornado the wars volcano eruption tsunami amen even in Mexico they are they are having a hail storm praise God you can look around that it's so different right now as Paul said they are groaning waiting for the manifestations of the Sons and Daughters of God the Earth is groaning waiting for the manifestation manifestations of your you and Sons and Daughters of God waiting for you they are waiting for you to change this into a millennial Reign where there's no trouble where there's no tears no fears no sickness whatsoever there is always peace for 1,000 years to be with Christ amen so whatever things that goes our way always believe the Lord Jesus Christ we need to be grateful all the trials okay it's good for me always welcome those trials don't think it a as a punishment don't think it as a punishment that do but think it as a teacher amen he will teach you character the trial is a character building amen because power outside of character will be satanic that's right but we need to have a character of Christ I don't have the character of Christ I am a short temper that's why I pastored a church for 5 years but I I I realize I I I cannot stand as a pastor cuz I have a short temper I have no patience I want to go always jump from one place to another amen so praise the Lord you just need to be what you are what God gives you to be don't impersonate others just be what you are if somebody else tells about you then they are not the Bride of Jesus Christ I tell you because if they are the Bride of Jesus Christ they will encourage you they will support you but if they are not the bride of Christ they will criticize you they will gossip about you they will tell somebody about your weaknesses but if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you will cover all kind of sin I know that brother make mistakes but don't tell it about don't tell it to somebody else amen right right if you know somebody that made a mistakes about you or say something about you and you get hurt you just go to that brother what brother what you tell me about what's wrong with me what did I make you stumble did I make you something like that just tell me that I can apologize I can make myself clear to you we need to be honest with one another Hallelujah you say praise the Lord the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in the last days the true bride will come to The [Music] Headstone that ass your word of God they will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church a super race as he nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they they will be even in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestations of the word of the Living God they will be one how can we be one with God is to accept his word in this last day whether you like it if you are the seed of God you will accept it not only believing it but we need to know him by the power of his resurrection amen I will go back to there is only one way provided by God for anything now he also promised that there would be a restoring of the faith we read in Jude that he said earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now we are promised in Malachi 4 by the the same system he always did that we would be restored back to the original faith we will be restored so we need to know who we are before we are going to be restored because if you don't know who you are how can you be restored amen not only restored in the Pentecostal Faith but when the seven seal was open it was God who manifest himself in Christ now it was Christ himself manifested in his church then back to Eden again the original faith in the book in The Book of Eden we will be returning back to that in the first Adam position we have fellowship with God we have dominion with God praise God we have life eternal God is going to restore us back to that condition and you need to know who you are so that you can enjoy being restored again you can have fellowship with God just like I said when God Fellowship during the time he can do anything he want amen he can say God will have fellowship and he will just say Amen to the every word he enjoy it amen no restriction and sometimes you cannot understand but just say Amen Lord amen Lord he didn't misconstrue Mis interpret or mislocate the word of God you just amen and amen Lord we are being restored back to that again if we don't know who we are then how can we be restored back right we don't know how to act when we be restored so restoration is only applied to those who are lost and be restored back again the revelation of who you are amen so when Adam said I want to go in the west side of Eden immediately he was there amen it was not an imagination it is a reality because Paul quoted in his Revelation he said in the twinkling of an eye the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet him in the air there will be a teleporting during the time in the twinkling of an eye we will be in his presence praise the Lord it is being made available for us now amen yes sir so that's why we need to practice yes if something comes up in your mind and it is the word of God don't hit say to say it because God is trying to train us to speak the word am amen don't look at the circumstances Lord I cannot make it I no try to speak it Lord I am healed Lord I am healed Lord forgive Lord forgive my brother and God will honor your word because he said if my word abideth in you you can speak anything amen and it was just like God speaking through you that's why you become a coworker of God you are not just a worker but you are a coworker because it was God in you doing the work so that's why speak the word when you say God bless you my brother God is honoring that word God bless you my brother God loves you my brother Hallelujah may the blessings of God upon you God is going to fulfill his word we need to practice it amen don't look at your troubles your trials every trials I have trials more than anybody else if if you say discouragement I am more discouraged than anybody else when you look at me we are standing or preaching as if no he has no problem no I have more problem than most of you maybe are we Bound by our problems no no we are bound by the love of God which is in our heart then Paul said who can separate me from the love of God can f in can sickness can poor wealth everything can you separated from the love no no one can separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus because this is not our choice it is God's choice that's right that's why a Christian praise God it's not our choice but to be a Christian is God's choice because no one can come to me except the father draw him near that's why we are here this morning because it was the heaven heavely father who comes that's why every Fellowship every Gathering is a supernatural I always believe that within my heart it's a supernatural thing right maybe some of you it's just a common how we come to church we just pray we sing song No it is a supernatural thing everything you come you have something that you listen to any word it is stored in your hard drive amen and when circumstances come he will put in amen he will put in remembrance the things that you have heard you can overcome all the obstacles by the word that you heard this last day that's why we are so blessed we have Wednesday service we have Sunday service we have some special services so you cannot blame God for your failure yeah you just blame it for yourself that's right you need to study more you need to that's why Paul said work out on your own salvation with fear and trembling you need to work out amen so that's why our young people if you want to have a muscle you need to work out amen yes if you have a big tmy like me you need to work out to flatten the stuff we need to work out so we need to work out our faith amen work out our faith with fear salvation amen we have so many mistakes but brother and sisters we are a one group of people if you have no mistakes we have somebody that will pray for you don't run away don't look at yourself as if somebody around you is somebody some people no the one that beside you they are Sons and Daughters of God so if you have trouble they are willing to pray for you amen don't look at somebody as if they are particular or they are different or they are no no take away that thought from your mind we are one that's why scripture say we need to comfort one another with this word Mal by the same system he always did that we would be restored back to the original Faith back to the original seed back to the seed like it begin back to the same Doctrine word word Power by power Spirit by the same thing just like it was back in the beginning Hallelujah just like in the beginning amen we have the Liberty whatever God's lead us to do we can just speak at the word amen musician if you come that's why I said I will be with you even in you until the end of the world and you will do greater things because I go to the father so he will be using you as his mouthpiece amen so if they're looking for Christ it's in your mouth Christ is the word and we have a prophetic Ministry to tell them what happened in the beginning the original sin is not eating by Apple it is their original sin you can tell them what happened what's happening now what God is doing our generation and what God is doing in the future amen this is no longer about evangelism that thing is already passed so that's why we are commissioned to prophesy and to prophesy is not about evangelism to prophesy means to tell what things happen what things happening and things that will be am amen coming thank you Lord that we recognize our day and our message amen the seed of God was being restored for the purpose of the Resurrection thank you Lord thank you Lord God look at our mistakes but his grace is so sufficient he knows we have Commit all mistakes we have shortcomings we have mistakes sometimes we thought different we think different we feel different but by the end of the day we just say Lord forgive me for my thought for my feelings I don't want to have ill feelings with my brothers I don't have to think different Lord I want to think I don't have if there's a malice in Your Heart Lord take away all the malice in my heart amen take away the grudges take away my hate Lord just cleanse me by your Holy Spirit consume me Lord by the power of your spirit amen amen amen don't not be different we are called by one Spirit baptized into the body of Jesus Christ we are [Music] one so we need to forgive one another encourage one [Music] another there is a resurrection and the resurrection is the person of Jesus Christ to know him is life that's why in 1 Corinthians chapter 15:1 16 24 if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised and if Christ be not raised your faith is in vain ye are not ye are yet in your sin then they also which have fallen asleep in Christ are perish if this life only we have hope in Christ we are old men most [Music] miserable but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruit of them that sleep if there is a first there will be a second the third fourth and fifth but he already prove it that he is risen that's right Hallelujah for sins by Man Came Death by men came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the first fruit of the word they are Christ at his coming Hallelujah so all the saints from Ephesians to our age they are looking forward to us and we need to hold on we need to believe right Satan will bombard us of everything in his capacity they will give us doubt they will give us unbelief in everything and they will use our eyes to see somebody who is talking who is who is who is using his lips to gossip one another what God is using Satan is perverting that's why Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and he's using that gossip gossip gossip gossip and if you listen to his gossip it will affect your spirit and you will look at your somebody your brother different thing because you already heard the gossip right that's why when Elisha curse those children who cursing him oh balad baldheaded baldheaded baldheaded and he cursed them and they all died and the prophet said it was not the children's mistake but it was the parent mistake that's right it was parent delinquency so when you talk about some Ministry don't talk in front of your children that's right we you when you don't dislike any Minister don't Tu it in your dinner table that's right because the children will adopt what they heard and in turn they will disrespect those ministers right spirit ually speaking they are already dead when you talk about some ministers because the parent are talking about oh brother so this brother Don't Preach well this brother don't don't and the children say amen amen because it was the father was talking they respect the father but in turn that spirit will linger into the child and every time he saw the ministers even before he preached he already conceive he has already preconceived that Brothers no no no and they don't listen to the word anymore then listen to the ministry not only to the ministry even our friend our neighbors don't talk somebody else in your dinner table amen because it will affect your children amen it will create a spirit of disrespect that's why the prophet said the prophet uh uh uh preached about respect we need to respect not only the ministry respect each other remember when the brother Braham said that he has an he has a neighbor who was a drunkard and every time brother brandham passed by he was drunk but every time he brother brandham passed by he said good morning paron he never said any ill word or bad words about brother [Music] benam so every time for how many years how many years he just good morning P he show respect and finally he died and the prophet said and somebody asked can he go to heaven and brother yes because of his respect to the ministry God what a great thing it is to respect one another love one another if you has short coming you have a snake just covered it with your love because Love cover all kind of sin that's right amen don't put somebody that is down and stumble him down again just lift him up amen because sooner or later if his son and daughter of God he will raise up that's right because the word was already spoken let every seed bring forth of its kind no amount Hallelujah of Darkness of trial can stop that seed to raise up in it Resurrection Hallelujah because it was already done deal it was already spoken so shall it be done shall We Stand amen first Thessalonian 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout yes and that shout is the message of the the hour we recognize the shout the message of the hour with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in ch shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord Verse 18 wherefore Comfort one another with this word amen Comfort is in the word that's right amen so we need to thank God for everything that we have done in our lives it's all by the grace of God nothing we can do is not by power not by might but it was all by God's grace thank you Lord he's working on us and God is still working on us thank you Lord that he's still working on us in the midst of our trials alah is still working in us he's working in our trials in working in our life in working our ambition but the most important thing that we recognize that we are Sons and Daughters of God that's right thank you Lord for revealing to me who I am amen thank you for revealing to me Lord if you look around millions and billions of people didn't even know what is happening right now that's right but by God's grace hallelujah amen that Jehovah of the Old Testament come by in our day and said I will be with you even in you to the end of the world take the pen and right and show them who they are yes so don't be discouraged just like Gideon when God called him I want you to deliver my people I want you to deliver your people and Gideon started to look at himself Lord maybe you're mistaken for somebody else because I am poor I am just just keep on hiding and hiding Lord maybe Lord God you're mistaken but God said no you are a manab just like don't look at yourself your mistake your shortcoming thou art a super race a super church and God said I love you and I will never leave you nor forsake you let's bow our head most gracious heavly father Lord thank you Lord God this
