[22:23] amen
[22:26] amen I just
[22:28] kind of been on my heart since I come
[22:31] back after my accident
[22:33] they're going home on a
[22:36] Monday morning
[22:37] a week or so ago and uh
[22:40] some people are asking you know and I
[22:42] just wanna
[22:44] say that the more I thought about it
[22:46] I knew it was a
[22:48] that the Lord held his hand upon me I
[22:52] mean I wasn't even supposed to take that
[22:55] little truck
[22:56] but I was doing a
[22:58] a favor I didn't
[23:00] I didn't want somebody else to have to
[23:02] drive another car that they're not used
[23:03] to on 93 so I told Israel I'll just take
[23:06] it you know we're selling it
[23:09] I mean
[23:10] so the most the biggest thing that after
[23:12] I
[23:13] got through with it is that the seat
[23:16] belt never worked
[23:17] when I went to take off in the morning
[23:19] there at the house
[23:21] and where's Israel
[23:25] has it been like that or what I mean I
[23:27] don't ever remember it not working
[23:30] I mean and I was jerking on that thing
[23:32] and it just held and held and held and
[23:34] I'm all right so then I get in go take
[23:36] off down the road
[23:38] I thought maybe I stopped
[23:40] and opened the door and it'll and it
[23:43] didn't it's still as hell but you know
[23:44] okay
[23:46] let's be honest
[23:47] how many were turned around and went and
[23:49] parked it and said well you know I'll
[23:51] get it fixed and then I'll go
[23:53] no you know and I'm not saying that's
[23:55] not wasn't the right thing to do but you
[23:57] know what
[23:58] God knows all things
[24:01] and uh
[24:03] so right there it was after I thought
[24:05] about that and when I hit that hit that
[24:08] bull
[24:09] party doing about I just passed the car
[24:13] perfect spot
[24:14] that's where we do it right there in the
[24:16] Bridle Creek boom boom I was almost off
[24:19] the end of the cutoff and uh
[24:22] come up over the other side about
[24:23] halfway down that
[24:25] it just it was there
[24:28] black bull black pavement overcast sky
[24:33] I didn't have time to hit my brakes
[24:36] hit it probably 60 65.
[24:40] and that the more I thought about even
[24:42] later you know I really didn't even feel
[24:44] the impact
[24:46] of the bag or whatever I mean I didn't
[24:48] have no bruising I've seen people
[24:51] after that them bags explode
[24:55] so there was no seat belt you know I was
[24:58] speeding yeah
[25:00] and uh but I don't you know I don't know
[25:03] what it means
[25:04] all I know is that you know what I I was
[25:06] there
[25:07] I'm able to talk about it
[25:10] you know I told I told Monica and you
[25:13] know she's like yeah we only had
[25:14] liabilities did you ever seen sixty five
[25:16] hundred dollars fly away
[25:19] you know she's telling her boss and I'm
[25:21] thinking
[25:22] you know you could
[25:24] you could have been planning a funeral
[25:27] and I even told that to the insurance
[25:28] agent you know because I only had
[25:30] liability this and I said yeah but you
[25:32] know what I could tell my wife they
[25:34] could be planning a funeral for me
[25:36] you know and all I know just God stayed
[25:40] his hand upon me I come out with
[25:43] a little knuckle buster right here on
[25:45] the hand I think my hands flew up hit
[25:47] the windshield
[25:49] and it was bleeding a little bit and
[25:51] that was it was stiff
[25:53] you know when I talked it and I'll
[25:55] finish with this I talked to a cousin
[25:56] back in Arkansas because we just got
[25:58] back and she was telling me when she was
[25:59] a kid one of her cousins was up in Texas
[26:03] I think it was on a country road
[26:06] went through a swinging gate and they
[26:08] weren't even going that fast
[26:10] they hit a cow and it killed her cousin
[26:13] I mean you know we just don't know
[26:18] and so I just wanted to give that test
[26:20] more that you know what
[26:22] God still stays his hand
[26:25] you know Israel says text me later he's
[26:28] like
[26:30] still trying to figure out
[26:32] that's just bizarre how this ice is
[26:35] I'm gonna cut my losses
[26:37] I says because I don't want to go back
[26:39] and try to do that in the Audi
[26:41] you know something that big party
[26:44] wouldn't and I would have had Monica
[26:45] with me

[48:06] who is a young Pastor from over there in
[48:12] Germany
[48:13] and Andreas Ringin is got quite a
[48:17] testimony in fact I've told you for many
[48:21] years now that we saw a great moving of
[48:24] the holy spirit in Germany
[48:26] God gave me a vision one day and I
[48:30] stepped into that Vision I had told
[48:33] Sandy about it
[48:34] and it was at a youth meeting in
[48:36] Northern Germany and there was a young
[48:39] man there
[48:41] I didn't know the wise in where for us
[48:43] and who's what and and they were it was
[48:45] our some of our first youth meetings in
[48:48] Germany
[48:51] but God had told me and showed me in a
[48:54] vision that I I was to
[48:57] point to this one man that was in the
[49:00] congregation
[49:01] and tell him to stand up and say that he
[49:04] loves the Lord
[49:06] now this was a young Rebel Rouser
[49:09] he was a young boy of the local Elder
[49:12] who invited us to the meetings
[49:16] been to church raised in the message
[49:18] raised around it but he didn't know if
[49:20] it was for him
[49:22] and he says God I need a sign
[49:25] I may believe
[49:30] God can give you
[49:32] a sign
[49:34] he said father I need you to give me a
[49:37] sign otherwise I'm done
[49:40] never go to church again
[49:43] I'm done I I need you
[49:46] to give me a sign and that sign is going
[49:48] to be that brother Ron calls me out
[49:52] and tells me to stand up
[49:55] and according to the vision that's
[49:57] exactly what I did
[49:59] I didn't know him I
[50:02] I said young man stand up I said
[50:05] stand up and say you love the Lord and
[50:08] these four girls that were sitting on
[50:09] the front row
[50:10] they turned around to see who it is and
[50:13] when they saw it they thought oh did
[50:15] this pastor ever blow it
[50:19] he's the worst one in the sanctuary
[50:23] but God knows what he's doing
[50:28] he asked God he prayed all night I need
[50:30] a sign
[50:31] have him to call me out and guess what
[50:33] we called him out and he started giving
[50:35] his testimony there in German and when
[50:37] he did the Holy Spirit just broke boom
[50:42] and
[50:43] he is a fine young man grown up to be a
[50:47] fine young man a pastor in Northern
[50:49] Germany I look forward to him coming and

[56:42] Matthew chapter 25.
[56:46] verses 1 through 13.
[56:51] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[56:53] likened unto ten virgins
[56:56] which took their lamps and went forth to
[56:59] meet the bridegroom and five of them
[57:00] were wise and five were foolish
[57:04] they that were foolish took no
[57:07] took their lamps and took no oil with
[57:10] them
[57:12] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[57:16] with their lambs
[57:18] while the bridegroom tiri they all
[57:20] slumbered and slept
[57:23] and at midnight there was a cry mate
[57:27] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[57:30] to meet him
[57:33] and all the virgins arose and trimmed
[57:38] their lamps
[57:39] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[57:41] us of your oil for our lamps are gone
[57:43] out
[57:45] but the wise answered saying not so
[57:48] lest there be not enough for us and you
[57:51] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[57:56] buy for yourselves
[57:58] and while they went to buy the
[58:00] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[58:03] went in with him to the marriage
[58:07] and the door was shut
[58:11] and afterward came also the other virgin
[58:13] saying Lord Lord open to us
[58:17] and he answered and said verily verily I
[58:19] say unto you I know you not
[58:23] watch therefore for you know not for you
[58:27] know neither the day nor the hour were
[58:30] in the son of man
[58:32] cometh turn with me one more scripture
[58:35] book of Acts
[58:37] chapter 2.
[58:40] Acts chapter 2 verses
[58:44] 12 through 21.
[58:50] and they were all amazed and were
[58:52] endowed saying one to another would
[58:54] meaneth this
[58:57] others mocking said these men are of
[59:01] are full of new wine
[59:04] but Peter's standing up with the eleven
[59:06] lifted up his voice instead of them you
[59:09] men of Judea
[59:10] and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be
[59:13] this known unto you and hearken to my
[59:15] words
[59:17] for these are not drunken as ye suppose
[59:20] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[59:23] day
[59:25] but this is that which was spoken by the
[59:28] prophet Jewel
[59:31] and it shall come to pass in the last
[59:33] days saith God I will pour out of my
[59:36] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[59:39] your daughters shall prophesy and your
[59:41] young men shall seek visions and your
[59:44] old men shall dream dreams and on my
[59:47] servants and on my hand maidens I will
[59:50] pour out in those days of my spirit and
[59:52] they shall prophesy
[59:55] and I will show wonders in Heaven above
[59:57] and the signs in the earth beneath them
[59:59] blood and Fire
[1:00:01] and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be
[1:00:03] turned into darkness the moon into blood
[1:00:06] before the great and notable day of the
[1:00:09] Lord
[1:00:10] and it shall come to pass and whosoever
[1:00:12] shall call on the name of the Lord shall
[1:00:16] be saved
[1:00:17] thus God's word is read and we ask a
[1:00:21] blessing upon it may God bless the
[1:00:24] reading of his word now to all of your
[1:00:26] hearts you may be seated now in the
[1:00:28] presence of God
[1:00:36] I would like to title my sermon this
[1:00:40] morning
[1:00:43] The Awakening of the wise and the
[1:00:45] foolish virgins
[1:00:49] I don't want to take a subject this
[1:00:51] morning of give us
[1:00:53] of your oil
[1:00:57] no you remember how I preached my last
[1:01:00] sermon on the wave Sheaf waved over
[1:01:03] elaudiusia
[1:01:06] and we know that Peter became the
[1:01:09] spokesperson of that day
[1:01:11] being filled with the Holy Ghost he
[1:01:13] stood up and
[1:01:14] began to tell these men because they
[1:01:17] said men and Brethren what must we do to
[1:01:20] be saved
[1:01:22] and Peter became the spokesperson on
[1:01:25] that day and he identified what God was
[1:01:27] doing in their midst
[1:01:29] and he took a modern-day event and
[1:01:31] applied it to scripture and he said this
[1:01:34] is that
[1:01:35] that was spoken
[1:01:37] this is the manifestation of what the
[1:01:40] prophet Joel said would come to pass
[1:01:47] Pentecost came after the wave sheep
[1:01:51] have been cut down and the wave sheep
[1:01:53] was the first one that came to maturity
[1:01:56] he was waived over the congregation
[1:01:57] seven times to show the rest of the
[1:01:59] field
[1:02:00] what they shall become now we all know
[1:02:03] that according to the gospel of brother
[1:02:05] Branham
[1:02:06] he said America rejected the gospel in
[1:02:09] 1956.
[1:02:12] he said she came up
[1:02:15] to a time he called it kadish barnia
[1:02:19] here the prophet was ready he had a word
[1:02:22] he was there he even was preaching
[1:02:25] in Azusa Street where in 1906 the
[1:02:29] Revival began
[1:02:32] in this last end time of the last Church
[1:02:34] age
[1:02:37] and he preaches his sermon return in
[1:02:39] Jubilee
[1:02:41] and he was giving them an admonishment
[1:02:46] let's go on let's take the land it's a
[1:02:48] good land flowing with milk and honey
[1:02:51] let us take the promises of God and go
[1:02:54] forward
[1:02:56] and they refused to cross over and he
[1:02:58] said America
[1:03:00] as a nation rejected the gospel 1956 he
[1:03:04] said Ichabod is written on the wall
[1:03:07] and he said judgment is going to strike
[1:03:09] America
[1:03:11] now we see America falling apart we see
[1:03:14] it it just coming apart at the seams we
[1:03:17] wonder and even as I spoke with the
[1:03:20] Brethren from overseas they said it is
[1:03:23] it is hard to imagine the change that is
[1:03:28] happening in America today
[1:03:31] how the people's minds how the
[1:03:34] government how the how everything seems
[1:03:38] to just be falling apart and we know
[1:03:40] that our prophet he preached the sermon
[1:03:42] the world falling apart and really when
[1:03:45] he spoke it Watch God's word when he
[1:03:48] speaks it it begins to come to pass
[1:03:53] he started all this
[1:03:55] he said the world
[1:03:57] is falling apart
[1:04:01] no
[1:04:05] the leadership of the word had been
[1:04:07] rejected
[1:04:09] and yes seven years after the revealing
[1:04:11] of the son of man comes to pass you have
[1:04:14] the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:04:18] brother Brown says in it is the rising
[1:04:21] of the sun remember there's only one
[1:04:23] sermon brother Brennan speaks eight
[1:04:25] times about the wave Sheaf and that is
[1:04:28] in the rising of the Sun
[1:04:32] he is the one that opened those seals he
[1:04:35] is those seals for the whole word of God
[1:04:37] is Christ
[1:04:38] and Christ is the seals that was opened
[1:04:41] what is the opening of them seals then
[1:04:44] revealing Christ
[1:04:47] and very seven angels which represented
[1:04:51] the seven Church ages all completed and
[1:04:54] we couldn't even see it they did they
[1:04:56] took the picture not us
[1:04:58] and there he is standing there Supreme
[1:05:00] judge
[1:05:02] showing that he is half an Omega the
[1:05:05] beginning and the end what
[1:05:07] identification quickening power did that
[1:05:10] to us
[1:05:11] quickening power lets us see his coming
[1:05:14] quickening power snatches from Death To
[1:05:17] Life quickening power gives discernment
[1:05:20] to know what's wrong with you and what
[1:05:22] to do what you have done and what you
[1:05:25] ought to not have done
[1:05:28] and what you should have done and what
[1:05:31] you will be quickening power all these
[1:05:33] things
[1:05:34] you cannot crucify Christ again
[1:05:37] unless he is here in some form in order
[1:05:40] to be crucified
[1:05:42] two thousand years ago the Jewish
[1:05:45] people and the the laity of that day
[1:05:50] crucified Christ
[1:05:52] that happened at the beginning of the
[1:05:55] Gentile dispensation
[1:05:57] and now it's happened again at the end
[1:05:59] of the Gentile dispensation
[1:06:02] brother Brenham said in the sermon the
[1:06:04] indictment
[1:06:05] as Peter said your denominational
[1:06:07] fathers Peter indicted you by the said
[1:06:11] which of your fathers hasn't done this
[1:06:14] Stephen done the same thing with Wicked
[1:06:16] hands you've crucified the Prince of
[1:06:18] Life
[1:06:19] Jesus didn't say himself which one of
[1:06:22] your fathers didn't put the prophets in
[1:06:24] the tombs and you garnish them
[1:06:26] afterwards
[1:06:27] so it has been the righteous man down
[1:06:30] Through the Ages and so I indict this
[1:06:32] High polished church-going bunch of
[1:06:34] Christ rejecting people of this day you
[1:06:37] with your forms of godliness Crucify My
[1:06:40] crisis second time by telling the people
[1:06:42] these words are for some other day it
[1:06:45] isn't for this day I indict you
[1:06:48] you're guilty of the same crime that
[1:06:50] they was on the day of the crucifixion
[1:06:52] repent and turn to God or perish
[1:06:59] now just lately
[1:07:01] I want to bring some Modern events that
[1:07:05] is happening here in America today to
[1:07:08] your attention
[1:07:12] have any of you heard
[1:07:15] of a Revival that's happening on Asbury
[1:07:18] College campus
[1:07:27] the prophet talks about
[1:07:30] Asbury
[1:07:33] 53 times
[1:07:37] did you know that Ormond Neville went to
[1:07:40] the college there
[1:07:43] he was a Methodist that got converted
[1:07:45] and got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:48] now let me just show you because I want
[1:07:50] to tie in what's going on right now
[1:07:53] and the world is looking at it wondering
[1:07:56] wow what is happening
[1:08:00] show you a few quotes I will restore in
[1:08:03] 1953 in Owensboro Kentucky
[1:08:08] and that fire was he had for a while
[1:08:10] through the Dark Ages but the first one
[1:08:13] that saw the pillar of fire was Martin
[1:08:15] Luther
[1:08:16] he sounded the Trump and come out of the
[1:08:18] Catholic church and the first saying you
[1:08:20] know it caused a great Universal Revival
[1:08:23] all right then the next one you know
[1:08:24] Martin Luther got to organize and he
[1:08:27] organized down so tight until the pillar
[1:08:29] of fire moved again
[1:08:31] but Luther couldn't go because he was
[1:08:33] organized and full of bunch of Doctrine
[1:08:36] but the pillar of fire moved just the
[1:08:38] same John Wesley saw it in England and
[1:08:41] away he went justification the Luther
[1:08:43] preached by faith and the first thing
[1:08:45] you know Wesley saw sanctification
[1:08:47] through the blood and away he went
[1:08:50] believing it and the first thing you
[1:08:51] know a great Revival saved England and
[1:08:53] America
[1:08:55] when him and Asbury
[1:08:57] and all of them come here to America
[1:09:00] great Revival swept the land the pillar
[1:09:04] of fire moved that's where you get the
[1:09:06] name of the college
[1:09:09] was this brother Asbury
[1:09:13] it is founded
[1:09:16] because of the Revival it had taken
[1:09:19] place there
[1:09:20] when he and John Wesley came over
[1:09:23] and preached to that group of people
[1:09:26] 1954 brother brennaman picking up again
[1:09:28] you methodists used to have Divine
[1:09:30] Healing power of God shouting well right
[1:09:33] here when Asbury and them come to
[1:09:36] America I'm speaking to some of you
[1:09:37] students
[1:09:39] you hear it Asbury here this morning see
[1:09:43] what I'm speaking of when Asbury your
[1:09:45] founder first come here and some of you
[1:09:47] dignified people to these methodists and
[1:09:50] Baptist Churches so forth when they
[1:09:53] first got uh come here the Methodist was
[1:09:55] called holy ruler Holy Rollers that's
[1:09:58] where you got your background
[1:10:01] so let me just tell you a little bit
[1:10:04] more about what's happening in Asbury
[1:10:07] College
[1:10:09] now I haven't been around Kentucky much
[1:10:13] uh but I was there with Charlie Cox
[1:10:17] and I looked on Google and I said how
[1:10:22] far is it away from Jeffersonville
[1:10:26] to Asbury College it says it's 81 miles
[1:10:31] from Jeffersonville it's about an hour
[1:10:34] and 25 minute drive
[1:10:37] brother Branham actually says I'll
[1:10:39] probably send both of my daughters to
[1:10:41] Asbury College
[1:10:43] I would like to go them go there he said
[1:10:45] it was quite
[1:10:47] a reputable college at that time
[1:10:53] in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:10:56] and forever in Campbellsville Kentucky
[1:10:59] 1955 he says brother Neville and after
[1:11:03] all some of you people here brother
[1:11:04] Neville happens to be a Methodist
[1:11:06] preacher out of I believe from Asbury
[1:11:09] wasn't that right brother from Asbury
[1:11:11] College
[1:11:12] how many ever heard Asbury College oh my
[1:11:14] that's a wonderful place
[1:11:16] it's right across out of my backyard
[1:11:20] see it's a marvelous place which I live
[1:11:23] close enough
[1:11:24] to send my children there
[1:11:27] to grow up
[1:11:31] broken cisterns
[1:11:33] I'm doing this for purpose just bear
[1:11:36] with me for a moment
[1:11:38] broken cisterns 1965.
[1:11:41] then God raised up John Wesley with
[1:11:43] sanctification the message the message
[1:11:46] of the second work of Grace and it was a
[1:11:48] wonderful thing but after Wesley and
[1:11:50] Asbury they organized it died then then
[1:11:53] come up the Pentecostals with the
[1:11:55] restoration the gifts they were doing
[1:11:57] fine what happened organized it and it
[1:12:00] died just exactly now in the midst of
[1:12:03] all of this God is still calling out a
[1:12:05] Remnant out of every one of those
[1:12:09] Generations
[1:12:10] remnant
[1:12:12] he's calling out a Remnant and may I say
[1:12:15] this I'm believing right now
[1:12:18] that what this move that is happening
[1:12:20] right now is calling remnant
[1:12:25] not bride
[1:12:27] remnant
[1:12:30] he certainly is and it's our time of
[1:12:33] coming out of gathering together and
[1:12:35] that's what I think the Full Gospel
[1:12:37] businessman has played a great part in
[1:12:40] breaking down these walls and saying
[1:12:42] there is no difference in us let us come
[1:12:45] together and worship God under one
[1:12:47] principle not under an organization
[1:12:51] if it was an organization I'd get off
[1:12:54] this platform right now as I have
[1:12:56] nothing to do with it brother Branham
[1:13:00] said I love the people in the
[1:13:02] denominations it's the system I'm
[1:13:04] against
[1:13:08] the Asbury College right now is
[1:13:10] experiencing
[1:13:14] a Revival
[1:13:17] that started on their Chapel campus
[1:13:21] I wonder what it this is all about
[1:13:24] why they're crying out for a Revival and
[1:13:28] a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:30] understand this that when the foolish
[1:13:33] virgin
[1:13:33] realize that they need oil
[1:13:36] that's the very hour the bridegroom
[1:13:39] comes
[1:13:43] mark of the beast 1961.
[1:13:46] and remember the very time that the
[1:13:48] sleeping virgin went to buy oil that's
[1:13:51] when the bridegroom came Glory don't you
[1:13:54] see it
[1:13:55] if the Presbyterians and the
[1:13:57] episcopalians and these others are
[1:13:59] coming seeking for the Holy Ghost you
[1:14:02] better get your lamp trimmed trimmed yes
[1:14:06] it needs trimming Pentecost better be
[1:14:09] trimming some lamps hallelujah amen
[1:14:13] get a lot of the world cut away from you
[1:14:16] you done got corroded over the Wicks
[1:14:19] gotta got in bad shape you know that
[1:14:22] Wick is a great thing I used to watch
[1:14:24] where the real Wick of God is a Believer
[1:14:27] is a wick look he's got fire on one end
[1:14:30] and uh the other ants dipped into oil
[1:14:33] drawing oil making fire
[1:14:36] what a church what a power what a place
[1:14:38] to be Hallelujah
[1:14:40] shining that same Gospel Light that
[1:14:43] shines in the East is shining in the
[1:14:45] West
[1:14:46] it shall be light in the evening time
[1:14:48] rise trim your lamp Pentecost trim off
[1:14:51] the world trim off the fashion of the
[1:14:53] world trim off the things of the world
[1:14:55] get ready the hour is at hand
[1:14:58] how many of you believe that now he said
[1:15:00] this in 1961. I say how much closer are
[1:15:04] we now
[1:15:07] I can say that to a bunch of message
[1:15:09] Believers today it's lamp trimming time
[1:15:13] it's time to be ready I believe that God
[1:15:16] is doing a move among his bride around
[1:15:18] the world this is not orchestration of
[1:15:21] man it is an orchestration of the Holy
[1:15:23] Spirit men are getting into the word of
[1:15:26] God and seeing things they have never
[1:15:29] seen before Jesus said the time will
[1:15:32] come when I wanted to tell you of these
[1:15:35] things but seeing you could not bear
[1:15:36] them now how be it after I'm gone you're
[1:15:39] going to begin to catch these things
[1:15:41] you'll begin to understand these
[1:15:44] Parables and things my brother my sister
[1:15:46] this is the day for us to understand
[1:15:49] this message and The Parables and the
[1:15:53] mysteries of God
[1:15:55] it is it belongs to us it is our
[1:15:59] inheritance
[1:16:01] how much longer do we have I believe
[1:16:04] right now we are very quickly closing
[1:16:07] the Gentile dispensation
[1:16:14] it's a time now that the youth
[1:16:17] they call this this is what they are
[1:16:20] calling it
[1:16:22] the Woodstock
[1:16:24] of the new generation
[1:16:29] young people
[1:16:31] that are sick and tired of religion
[1:16:35] of lighting candles and saying prayers
[1:16:38] and just being religious they want
[1:16:42] something real
[1:16:43] and I can say to each and every one of
[1:16:46] you God is real and don't you dare make
[1:16:50] him some form of creed and dogma and of
[1:16:54] a religious way huh we need God to come
[1:16:58] on the scene what he's real I know he's
[1:17:02] real
[1:17:10] having a form of godliness and denying
[1:17:13] the power thereof the Bible says from
[1:17:16] such
[1:17:17] turn away
[1:17:21] God give us something real
[1:17:26] and the sermon only believe
[1:17:28] watch brother Branham go after this
[1:17:31] 1961. I'm going to say it because it's
[1:17:34] on tape our brother can hear it if he
[1:17:35] wants to get this tape
[1:17:37] Kernan concerning Brother David duplicy
[1:17:41] my precious brother and friend
[1:17:44] I got a letter of criticism from him and
[1:17:46] I didn't want to read it secretary got
[1:17:49] it and I didn't want to read it because
[1:17:51] it I withheld saying his name on a tape
[1:17:55] but this is taped
[1:17:57] the tapes are going here's exactly what
[1:18:00] I said
[1:18:01] I was preaching on the Nearing of the
[1:18:04] coming of Christ and Brother David is
[1:18:06] dealing with the presbyterian's
[1:18:08] Methodist Baptists and those great men
[1:18:11] that is his ministry to them
[1:18:14] God has sent him with a Ministry David
[1:18:18] is a smart Theologian scholar and
[1:18:21] wonderful man of God he's been with me
[1:18:24] in the meetings he stood by my side I
[1:18:27] love him as an only brother could love
[1:18:30] another and that is true
[1:18:33] and I said about David and the church
[1:18:35] will bear me witness I said it seems
[1:18:37] like Brother David as spiritual as he is
[1:18:42] would wake up to the fact to know he's
[1:18:44] dealing with sleeping virgin
[1:18:48] and the Pentecostal people are so glad
[1:18:50] to see the Presbyterians writing in a
[1:18:53] little declaration we got to go back and
[1:18:56] watch this we got to go back to Divine
[1:18:58] Healers
[1:18:59] we got to go back to speaking in tongues
[1:19:02] you read the piece where they put out we
[1:19:06] got to go back and have healing Services
[1:19:09] Billy Graham talking got to go back to
[1:19:12] Pentecost do you realize brother that
[1:19:15] the very hour that they went to wake the
[1:19:18] sleeping virgin up when she come to buy
[1:19:21] oil that's when Jesus came
[1:19:24] oh
[1:19:26] God help us to recognize the lateness of
[1:19:30] this hour
[1:19:32] the prophet of God was making his church
[1:19:35] in the message Believers to actually you
[1:19:38] be aware of what was happening even
[1:19:41] among denomination taking modern events
[1:19:44] looking at the news reading the paper
[1:19:48] then he preached the anointed ones at
[1:19:50] the end time in 1962 he preaches
[1:19:54] unbelief does not hinder God
[1:19:56] when you see the methodists and the
[1:19:58] Baptists and Presbyterians and so forth
[1:20:01] seeking after the Holy Ghost be careful
[1:20:05] that's the hour when the sleeping virgin
[1:20:08] began to come and they said give us of
[1:20:10] your oil
[1:20:13] now you got to get it the same way where
[1:20:15] we got it
[1:20:17] and when they went after it it was the
[1:20:20] very hour the bridegroom came
[1:20:22] and the bride was taken in and they were
[1:20:25] left out
[1:20:26] and there was weeping and wailing and
[1:20:28] gnashing of teeth I wonder if my
[1:20:31] Pentecostal people have their eyes open
[1:20:33] to such as that to realize right at the
[1:20:37] verge of his appearing just at any time
[1:20:40] nothing else left
[1:20:45] I have
[1:20:47] a couple short little videos I normally
[1:20:52] don't do this but I I decided to go
[1:20:55] ahead and take from the news that is
[1:20:58] happening now
[1:21:00] to let you hear what they say
[1:21:03] firsthand witness of it
[1:21:07] now they are quoting habakkuk
[1:21:11] as the Old Testament
[1:21:14] habakkuk chapter 1 verse 5.
[1:21:19] behold ye among the Heathen and regard
[1:21:23] and wonder marvelously
[1:21:26] for I will work a work in your days
[1:21:29] which he will not believe
[1:21:32] though it be told you
[1:21:34] this is the central theme that God is
[1:21:38] doing a work among them
[1:21:46] February 8th
[1:21:48] is when this revival began to start
[1:21:52] if you remember February 8th here at
[1:21:54] this church we played the tape the
[1:21:56] debate on tongues
[1:21:58] Wednesday
[1:22:01] let me share with you just a few
[1:22:03] comments before you I show you some
[1:22:05] videos
[1:22:07] says the Revival I'm quoting them
[1:22:09] directly
[1:22:10] from a witness that was there it began
[1:22:14] at a chapel service on February 8th
[1:22:17] Zach mere cribs the assistant soccer
[1:22:21] coach who is also the leader
[1:22:24] leadership development coordinator for
[1:22:27] the missions organization envision
[1:22:30] he preached about becoming love in
[1:22:33] action
[1:22:34] his text was Romans chapter 12.
[1:22:38] as he started mere Krebs told the
[1:22:41] students you were required to attend
[1:22:43] three chapels per week
[1:22:45] that he wasn't aiming to entertain them
[1:22:49] and he didn't want them to focus on him
[1:22:53] I hope you guys forget me but anything
[1:22:56] but the Holy Spirit and God's word would
[1:22:58] be fertile ground in your hearts and
[1:23:02] produce fruit
[1:23:05] Romans 12 the only star is him
[1:23:12] God's word in Jesus and the Holy Spirit
[1:23:15] moving in our midst that's what we're
[1:23:18] hoping for
[1:23:20] mere Krebs also talked to them about the
[1:23:23] experience of God's love in contrast to
[1:23:26] radically poor love that narcissistic
[1:23:29] and abusive manipulative and selfish
[1:23:33] some of you guys have experienced that
[1:23:35] loving Church
[1:23:36] he said and maybe it's not violent maybe
[1:23:39] it's not male molestation it's not taken
[1:23:43] advantage of but it feels like someone
[1:23:45] has pulled a fast one on you
[1:23:49] no one came forward at the end of the
[1:23:51] service
[1:23:52] a mirror crab was convinced he totally
[1:23:57] whiffed it
[1:23:58] he texted his wife
[1:24:01] latest stinker
[1:24:04] I'll be home soon
[1:24:07] then a black gospel Trio sang a final
[1:24:10] song in the
[1:24:13] Chapel ended in about 18 or 20 students
[1:24:16] 19 students stayed
[1:24:19] they sat in clusters
[1:24:22] a few in our seats a few on the floor in
[1:24:24] the aisle a few in the front of the
[1:24:26] stage they kept praying
[1:24:28] and Zeke atha
[1:24:30] a Junior told the documentarian a few
[1:24:33] days later that he was one of the ones
[1:24:35] who remained in the chapel he left after
[1:24:37] an hour to go to a class but then when
[1:24:40] he got out he heard singing
[1:24:45] I said okay that's weird
[1:24:48] I went back up and it was surreal
[1:24:51] the piece that was in the room was
[1:24:53] unexplainable
[1:24:55] he and a few friends immediately left
[1:24:57] sprinting across campus bursting in the
[1:25:00] classroom and announcing
[1:25:02] the Revival is happening
[1:25:05] my goodness the Wesleyan movement school
[1:25:09] has a tradition of revivals and a
[1:25:12] theology that teaches people to wait and
[1:25:15] watch for divined wind to blow
[1:25:19] the university is named for Francis
[1:25:22] Asbury
[1:25:23] the early American Methodist Bishop who
[1:25:26] encouraged and celebrated revivals from
[1:25:28] Maine to Georgia and Maryland to
[1:25:30] Tennessee
[1:25:33] there are also people in Kentucky
[1:25:35] community
[1:25:36] who have long prayed for fresh Revival
[1:25:39] at the school including a Malaysian
[1:25:41] Theologian teacher who sometimes walked
[1:25:44] up and down the streets with a cardboard
[1:25:47] sign and said holy spirit you are
[1:25:49] welcome here
[1:25:51] administrators however did not
[1:25:53] immediately assume a Revival was
[1:25:55] starting
[1:25:56] even as young men ran around campus
[1:25:59] shouting it was
[1:26:00] only a spontaneous prayer service
[1:26:03] stretched into the afternoon
[1:26:05] and then evening
[1:26:06] did eat did official school officials
[1:26:10] realize they might have a decision
[1:26:12] to make and how to respond
[1:26:16] let me tell you when God moves
[1:26:25] he don't need your help
[1:26:29] on the day of Pentecost
[1:26:32] the Bible says and when the day of
[1:26:33] Pentecost was fully come and they all
[1:26:35] became in one mind in one Accord and it
[1:26:38] says and the pillar of fire came down
[1:26:41] and tongues of fire set upon each one of
[1:26:44] them what were they doing
[1:26:46] City
[1:26:50] God don't need your help
[1:26:52] if he's God
[1:26:55] amen he don't need the organ and a piano
[1:26:58] we don't need to work it up by emotion
[1:27:00] you know what God is God
[1:27:08] now if the Brethren are ready with the
[1:27:11] cup okay they're ready turn the volume
[1:27:13] up here I don't know if it shows the
[1:27:16] little video clip at the beginning here
[1:27:18] is Tucker Carlson
[1:27:23] foreign
[1:27:26] turn it up
[1:27:29] reports that people are flying in from
[1:27:31] Singapore New Zealand to join whatever
[1:27:34] this is and so we thought it'd be worth
[1:27:36] finding out what is it
[1:27:38] Allison for fader is the student body
[1:27:40] president as per University and she
[1:27:42] joins us and Allison you're so nice to
[1:27:44] come on thank you what it what is this
[1:27:46] do you think
[1:27:48] right what is this that's what I mean
[1:27:51] that's the question right and um a theme
[1:27:53] or a Bible verse that we've all been
[1:27:55] sharing with each other I said Back At
[1:27:56] One and the Lord says look at the
[1:27:58] Nations and watch for I'm doing
[1:27:59] something in your day that you wouldn't
[1:28:01] believe if you were told and it's
[1:28:03] happening and we can hardly believe it
[1:28:07] well it seems remarkable I mean so many
[1:28:09] stories you see them and you think
[1:28:10] that's very different I'm not quite sure
[1:28:12] what it means but it's worth learning
[1:28:13] more so my understanding is this began
[1:28:15] in a completely conventional service and
[1:28:18] a boy got up and started talking about
[1:28:21] his own flaws and then it just something
[1:28:24] changed in the atmosphere and it never
[1:28:26] ended is that fair
[1:28:29] that's completely what happened um so
[1:28:31] here at Asbury University three mornings
[1:28:33] a week we have Chapel at 10 A.M sharp
[1:28:35] the whole student body gets together and
[1:28:36] we we sing praise to the Lord and we
[1:28:39] hear a message from a speaker and for
[1:28:41] seemingly no reason at first on on
[1:28:43] Wednesday February 8th it didn't end and
[1:28:45] that's that's kind of the logistical
[1:28:46] side of what's been going on and then
[1:28:48] you know on the on the deeper side of
[1:28:50] things what's been happening here since
[1:28:51] Wednesday is there's a there's a young
[1:28:54] Army of believers who are rising to
[1:28:56] claim Christianity the faith as their
[1:28:59] own as a Young Generation and as a free
[1:29:01] generation and that's why people can't
[1:29:03] get enough
[1:29:05] it's amazing so you felt like something
[1:29:08] like this was going to happen because
[1:29:10] everything finds equilibrium I think who
[1:29:12] are the people who are coming where are
[1:29:13] they coming from
[1:29:17] um we don't know most of them
[1:29:19] um we've obviously been getting calls
[1:29:21] hundreds of calls to the university
[1:29:22] switchboard number but we have friends
[1:29:25] here from Brazil from Indonesia
[1:29:29] um almost every state
[1:29:31] um and and they just keep coming and and
[1:29:34] it's no wonder you know and it's like
[1:29:36] you said I mean especially in the midst
[1:29:38] of tragedies like what we've seen in
[1:29:39] Michigan State University and and even
[1:29:41] farther back to 2020 especially Our
[1:29:43] Generation was impacted so much and so
[1:29:46] you have to wonder you know what's going
[1:29:48] to break and in this case the holy the
[1:29:50] Holy Spirit has interceded for us here
[1:29:51] at Asbury and and Across the Nation
[1:29:55] I assume you don't know how long this
[1:29:56] will continue
[1:29:59] I could not tell you and I wouldn't
[1:30:01] wouldn't want to guess
[1:30:04] Allison thank you great to see you
[1:30:07] appreciate it thank you really thank you
[1:30:09] I appreciate you having me on
[1:30:12] she made the comment
[1:30:14] there is a young
[1:30:16] Army of young people rising up
[1:30:20] taking God at his word
[1:30:23] let's listen to the next one
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:30] Church attendance in general has gone
[1:30:32] down particularly amongst the millennial
[1:30:34] generation I think many Millennials are
[1:30:35] leaving the church because they don't
[1:30:37] feel like the church is relevant or
[1:30:39] meets their felt needs the percent of
[1:30:41] Americans who identify with any religion
[1:30:43] has been on the decline for decades the
[1:30:46] biggest generational drop-off is with
[1:30:48] millennials well maybe that's the case
[1:30:51] for organized religion but maybe the
[1:30:54] conclusion is a little simplistic
[1:30:55] because we're seeing something
[1:30:57] interesting happening on college
[1:30:58] campuses across the country it started
[1:31:01] on February 8th at Asbury University in
[1:31:03] Kentucky
[1:31:05] Chapel Services started that morning
[1:31:07] and then they didn't end for 13 days 50
[1:31:11] 000 people flocked to the small town to
[1:31:12] experience the Asbury Revival
[1:31:16] and that ended up spawning Marathon
[1:31:18] worship Services all over including at
[1:31:22] Cedarville University in Ohio where my
[1:31:24] next guest played piano for six hours
[1:31:27] straight
[1:31:29] joining me now is lalitha Gaddy she's a
[1:31:33] student at Cedarville University lalitha
[1:31:36] um this started
[1:31:38] at your school about a week ago
[1:31:41] and it's still happening
[1:31:44] I mean this is wild what what's going on
[1:31:48] here explain it to our audience
[1:31:51] yeah thank you so much for having me on
[1:31:53] the show Laura
[1:31:54] um God is definitely at work at
[1:31:56] Cedarville and it's been absolutely
[1:31:58] amazing to see because we see students
[1:32:01] worshiping we see students praying we
[1:32:03] see students praying through scripture
[1:32:05] specifically we see students repenting
[1:32:08] of their sins and turning to Christ then
[1:32:11] So Beautiful to see now Oliver is there
[1:32:15] a sense that the world itself when we
[1:32:19] see it in many ways coming apart at the
[1:32:21] seams the attack on on traditional
[1:32:24] families the gender bending the culture
[1:32:29] you know a lot of people think is pretty
[1:32:30] depraved
[1:32:32] um and in is it drugs and all everything
[1:32:34] I think for young people today there's
[1:32:36] so much pressure on young people in
[1:32:38] social media
[1:32:39] do people are now people seeking a you
[1:32:42] know refuge in in in scripture in a
[1:32:46] consistency in the Almighty
[1:32:49] I think
[1:32:51] I think that hope can only be found in
[1:32:54] Christ and that's what we're seeing here
[1:32:56] at Cedarville because like
[1:32:58] um a lot of times people turn to all
[1:32:59] those things that you mentioned as a way
[1:33:01] to escape their reality but I think hope
[1:33:05] can only be found in the work of Christ
[1:33:07] on the cross and that's what we're
[1:33:09] seeing here we see people putting their
[1:33:11] faith in Christ and turning away from
[1:33:13] their sins and it has been absolutely
[1:33:16] wonderful to see
[1:33:17] now are people coming to the Revival who
[1:33:21] maybe were skeptical
[1:33:23] doubters not weren't sure they believed
[1:33:26] and have you seen personal
[1:33:28] transformation
[1:33:30] along the way
[1:33:32] yeah I think even in my own life it has
[1:33:36] made me a lot more cognizant of the fact
[1:33:38] that
[1:33:40] eternity matters and that we are living
[1:33:41] for something that's so much more than
[1:33:44] just the here and now and every single
[1:33:46] one of our decisions impacts that and it
[1:33:49] has just made me want to live a life
[1:33:51] that is more worthy because the Bible
[1:33:54] tells us that it talks about returning
[1:33:56] to our first love and I think that's
[1:33:58] what we're seeing I'm not sure if I
[1:33:59] would call it a Revival yet but I think
[1:34:02] we'll know based on the fruits because
[1:34:04] it's not going to stop here this is
[1:34:05] something that we need to see in
[1:34:08] neighborhoods all across America it's
[1:34:10] not confined to Cedarville in any way or
[1:34:13] Asbury or anywhere else the same Holy
[1:34:15] Spirit that's here is at work this is
[1:34:18] awesome
[1:34:19] it's so great to get away from politics
[1:34:21] into something that really really
[1:34:22] matters thank you for joining us tonight
[1:34:25] [Applause]
[1:34:31] you can take God
[1:34:34] off of the money
[1:34:37] you can take God out of our courtrooms
[1:34:41] you can forbid prayer
[1:34:44] in our classrooms and on our campuses
[1:34:47] but guess what
[1:34:49] he's got it all
[1:34:51] in control and when they think they've
[1:34:54] got him out guess what he comes in and
[1:34:57] right among the college students
[1:35:01] in the places of higher education in the
[1:35:05] tree of knowledge in the midst of
[1:35:08] Satan's Eden guess what God is doing
[1:35:10] saying return back to your first love
[1:35:19] in Matthew 5 verses 43 4 through 48 and
[1:35:24] ye have heard that it hath been said
[1:35:26] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:35:28] thine enemy
[1:35:30] but I say unto you love your enemies
[1:35:33] bless them that curse you
[1:35:37] do good to them that hate you and pray
[1:35:39] for them that despitefully use you and
[1:35:42] persecute you
[1:35:44] that you may be the children of your
[1:35:46] father which is in heaven
[1:35:48] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[1:35:51] evil and on the good with sendeth Reign
[1:35:54] on the just and the unjust
[1:35:56] for if you love them which love you what
[1:35:58] reward have ye
[1:36:00] AST do not the publicans the same and if
[1:36:03] you salute your brethren only
[1:36:05] what do ye more than others do not even
[1:36:08] the publicans
[1:36:10] so
[1:36:11] be therefore perfect
[1:36:14] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:36:17] is perfect
[1:36:19] I have learned something just recently
[1:36:26] to love
[1:36:29] with a Godly love
[1:36:32] to not judge anyone
[1:36:36] to have a love that would
[1:36:39] forgive
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:47] brother random said if you want to make
[1:36:49] Heaven your home
[1:36:51] you must have
[1:36:53] perfect love
[1:36:57] oh we work on the Creeds and the dogmas
[1:37:00] and this and that and so much of the
[1:37:03] time we miss the very thing that's most
[1:37:05] important
[1:37:06] hereby know that you shall be my
[1:37:09] disciples
[1:37:11] that you have love one for another
[1:37:15] we have to have everybody agree with us
[1:37:17] or we don't love them
[1:37:18] we exclude them
[1:37:22] shame on us
[1:37:29] I don't care if you see it the way I see
[1:37:31] it
[1:37:33] that's okay
[1:37:36] I still gonna love you
[1:37:40] um
[1:37:42] I remember David Wilkerson when he went
[1:37:44] to the streets where the gangs were at
[1:37:48] and God had sent him
[1:37:50] and there you remember the the book The
[1:37:53] Crossing the switchblade
[1:37:57] he had a gang member and he came up
[1:37:59] there and said David Wilkerson you have
[1:38:01] the audacity to come down here and try
[1:38:04] to preach us to gang members and thieves
[1:38:07] and robbers and everything and I'm going
[1:38:09] to cut you up
[1:38:11] into every little tiny piece that I can
[1:38:14] possibly do
[1:38:16] and David Wilkerson said these words he
[1:38:19] said and when you do every piece will
[1:38:22] Echo back I love
[1:38:25] you
[1:38:31] God help me to love
[1:38:34] love with a
[1:38:36] a godlier
[1:38:42] when the prophet went to Green's Mill
[1:38:44] and he was asking God about
[1:38:48] what about this anointing that seems to
[1:38:50] be falling here and there and how is it
[1:38:53] that
[1:38:55] this anointing is falling on all of the
[1:38:58] churches and people and God I don't
[1:39:00] understand it
[1:39:05] and remember and I'm going to give you
[1:39:06] the quote then I'll go to the scripture
[1:39:09] but in the seed of discrepancy preached
[1:39:12] here in Phoenix he said
[1:39:14] I had God in the dusty cave in one
[1:39:16] afternoon I walked out laid my Bible on
[1:39:18] a log and it bloated open to Hebrews
[1:39:21] the sixth chapter
[1:39:24] which said in the last days how it be
[1:39:27] if we fell away from the truth and
[1:39:29] renewed ourselves
[1:39:31] again under repentance there was no more
[1:39:34] sacrifice for sin and that thorns and
[1:39:36] thistles which was nigh under rejection
[1:39:39] whose end is to be burned but the rain
[1:39:41] cometh upon the Earth often to water and
[1:39:43] to dress it but the thorns and thistles
[1:39:46] would be rejected but the wheat would be
[1:39:48] gathered and I thought well it's just
[1:39:51] the wind happened to blow that open well
[1:39:53] I just laid the Bible down again I
[1:39:55] thought well now I'll just and here
[1:39:57] comes the wind bloated open
[1:39:59] it happened three times
[1:40:02] then I raised up and I thought Lord
[1:40:05] why would you open that Bible for me to
[1:40:07] read that
[1:40:10] and when I get down to that thorns and
[1:40:12] thistles which is nine to rejection is
[1:40:14] in to be burned I thought
[1:40:16] why would you open that to me there
[1:40:21] he reads on now
[1:40:24] these real Visions come without pulling
[1:40:27] it into any gear that's just God
[1:40:30] see and I looked and I seen an earth it
[1:40:32] was turning out in front of me and I've
[1:40:34] seen it all disked
[1:40:37] there was a man dressed in white went
[1:40:39] around sowing wheat
[1:40:41] and after he went around the scripture
[1:40:43] or the Earth around come a man looked
[1:40:45] horrible and he was dressed in black and
[1:40:48] he was throwing weed seeds all over it
[1:40:50] they both came up together
[1:40:53] and when they did they both were thirsty
[1:40:55] because the rain was needed and each one
[1:40:57] looked like it was prey a little head
[1:41:00] bent over lord Send the Rain send the
[1:41:02] rain and the great clouds come up the
[1:41:04] rain fell upon both of them when it did
[1:41:06] the little wheat jumped up began to say
[1:41:08] praise the Lord praise the Lord and the
[1:41:11] little weed jumped up right on the same
[1:41:13] sign said praise the Lord praise the
[1:41:15] Lord
[1:41:16] the vision was interpreted the rain
[1:41:18] falls on the just and the unjust The
[1:41:20] Same Spirit can fall in a meeting and
[1:41:22] everybody rejoicing it Hypocrites
[1:41:24] Christians and all together exactly
[1:41:27] right
[1:41:28] but what is it
[1:41:29] by their fruits
[1:41:32] you shall know them
[1:41:33] I think we live in a timely age when
[1:41:36] these things should be preached and
[1:41:38] talked about
[1:41:39] I do believe that this move is a genuine
[1:41:42] move of the Holy Ghost anointing
[1:41:46] because they're seeking more of God and
[1:41:48] whenever people go to seeking more of
[1:41:50] God there is more of God to be found
[1:41:55] because these young people have heard so
[1:41:59] much and seen so much and experienced so
[1:42:02] much that they doubt is God real
[1:42:07] so God is once again reaching out by his
[1:42:11] holy presence making himself known see
[1:42:15] they want a genuine move of God in their
[1:42:18] midst they've tried Church religion
[1:42:21] they've tried Christianity with no power
[1:42:26] you see
[1:42:28] I believe now
[1:42:30] as I say this in closing that the
[1:42:33] Terrors are being bound
[1:42:36] first
[1:42:38] that's what the Bible said
[1:42:42] and the Seal of Christ 1955 musicians if
[1:42:45] you come I got just a couple quotes here
[1:42:50] God is our Eternal judge whether you
[1:42:53] have the Holy Spirit or not
[1:42:55] no one can judge you God Alone
[1:42:59] but we have a sign that says by their
[1:43:01] fruits you shall know them
[1:43:03] not by their Church affiliation but by
[1:43:05] their fruits you shall know them nowhere
[1:43:08] in the Bible does it say that
[1:43:09] affiliation with church is a sign
[1:43:13] no we're in the Bible does it say
[1:43:15] shouting is a sign
[1:43:16] nowhere in the Bible does it say
[1:43:18] speaking in tongues is a sign nowhere in
[1:43:20] the Bible does it say Healing The Sick
[1:43:22] is a sign the sign of the Believers the
[1:43:25] fruits of the spirit
[1:43:28] and the fruits of the spirit is not
[1:43:30] seeing visions not Healing The Sick not
[1:43:32] speaking with tongues not shouting the
[1:43:34] fruits of the spirit is love
[1:43:37] joy peace long-suffering goodness
[1:43:39] meekness gentleness patience amen that's
[1:43:43] the Seal of God
[1:43:44] that may sound a little flat-footed but
[1:43:47] we're going on down the Old Testament in
[1:43:49] a few minutes
[1:43:50] bring it out in the new and find out it
[1:43:52] isn't just right that's the true brother
[1:43:55] if you get back on the right foot and
[1:43:57] get started God will shake this nation
[1:44:00] with a Revival
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:04] but you got to get back to God lay aside
[1:44:06] every weight
[1:44:08] of the sin that does so easily beset you
[1:44:10] and run with patience the race
[1:44:16] leadership
[1:44:18] 65.
[1:44:20] he put a over seed in a wheat seed
[1:44:23] in the same bed and pour water
[1:44:25] down upon them and anoint them they'll
[1:44:27] both rejoice
[1:44:29] they'll both grow by it
[1:44:32] same water
[1:44:34] The Sun Shines on the just
[1:44:37] and the unjust
[1:44:39] the rain falls in the just and the
[1:44:41] unjust but by their fruits you shall
[1:44:43] know them
[1:44:45] how can you keep from lining up with the
[1:44:48] word amen see what I mean
[1:44:49] the water falls on the just and the
[1:44:52] injust
[1:44:53] ice anointed
[1:44:57] I'm not just wanting an anointing or
[1:45:00] some
[1:45:02] feel good experience
[1:45:06] because the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:45:08] is to come and to Quicken that seed
[1:45:11] inside of you
[1:45:12] and reveal the word to you that you
[1:45:15] would live a life
[1:45:17] that is pleasing to him
[1:45:26] what we're seeing right now it
[1:45:29] it amazes me
[1:45:32] my grandsons listen to what's happening
[1:45:34] on these college campuses

[1:45:42] don't want Church entity we don't want
[1:45:43] this we don't want lighten candles and
[1:45:45] saying prayers

[1:45:53] and if you will ask God
[1:45:56] show thyself
[1:45:58] I need to know you
[1:46:01] he will
[1:46:03] but he don't clown and he don't
[1:46:06] for nobody
[1:46:07] if you really mean it
[1:46:10] he will show himself to you
[1:46:12] because he's God

[1:47:48] of the hour but they haven't recognized
[1:47:50] what's been done
[1:47:51] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:47:53] they know something is supposed to
[1:47:56] happen
[1:47:57] but they're looking for it way off in
[1:47:59] the future to come when it's already

[1:48:17] in the midst
[1:48:18] of the end of the Gentile dispensation
[1:48:22] the End of the lotusian Age
[1:48:25] and something is happening among
[1:48:27] denomination
[1:48:30] and uh among liberals
[1:48:33] and kids with long hair
[1:48:36] colored earies
[1:48:39] tattoos
[1:48:41] all of the confusion that is correct
[1:48:44] that has absolutely gathered around them
[1:48:46] they are victims
[1:48:50] of the social media
[1:48:52] and have
[1:48:53] all of this liberalism
[1:48:56] and all they want is life
[1:49:01] and the only life is Christ
[1:49:05] can you say Amen to that
[1:49:09] people are looking to drugs movies sex
[1:49:13] all kinds of things
[1:49:16] when really he says come unto me ye all
[1:49:18] ye that are weary and are heavy laden
[1:49:20] and I will give you rest
[1:49:22] take my yoke upon you for my yoke is
[1:49:24] easy
[1:49:25] and my burden is light
[1:49:28] I'm so glad that I know him
[1:49:33] sometimes when I become so burdened
[1:49:39] and I feel like I'm being crushed
[1:49:42] and there's a heavy weight upon me I say
[1:49:45] father help me you said you'd be with me
[1:49:49] and he comes
[1:49:50] and you know according to that poem he
[1:49:53] said in that hard time
[1:49:54] he said I seen the footprints
[1:49:57] of you and Christ walking together but
[1:50:00] when we came to the real hard times
[1:50:02] there's only one set of footprints
[1:50:05] did you leave me then was I walking
[1:50:07] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:50:09] death
[1:50:10] and you left me
[1:50:13] is that what you did
[1:50:15] why only one set of footprints
[1:50:18] he said my son those are not yours
[1:50:24] they're mine
[1:50:26] that's when I carried you
[1:50:30] that's what he's doing with me right now
[1:50:33] he's carrying me
[1:50:41] I've tried to be a good father I failed
[1:50:48] I've tried to be a good pastor
[1:50:53] I failed
[1:50:56] I've tried to do so many things and I
[1:51:01] I admit to all of you
[1:51:03] if there's anything I've ever done that
[1:51:05] was good it was because of him because I
[1:51:08] myself
[1:51:10] am a failure
[1:51:14] I need him more than I've ever needed
[1:51:17] him and if God would just bear me up

[1:51:50] where I can get away
[1:51:53] oh David said if I had the wings of a
[1:51:56] dove I'd fly away and be at rest how

[1:52:11] wake up in the morning that's okay
[1:52:22] how many of you believe that he can be
[1:52:25] touched
[1:52:27] by the feeling of your infirmity
[1:52:34] would you envision him right now with
[1:52:36] this
[1:52:37] arms outstretched saying come unto me

[1:56:41] commendeth his love towards us that
[1:56:44] while we were yet sinners
[1:56:47] Christ died for us it's not because of
[1:56:49] how good you are how good you keep the
[1:56:53] Commandments because Jesus said he
[1:56:56] that's guilty of one part is guilty of
[1:56:59] all which one of us have are not totally
[1:57:02] guilty then

[1:57:26] faith in Jesus Christ and he is my Lord
[1:57:29] and Savior therefore

[1:57:48] [Music]
[1:57:50] you
[1:57:52] will never know if you can walk on water
[1:57:57] till you get out of the boat
[1:57:59] [Music]
[1:58:01] maybe God is just trying to get us out
[1:58:04] of our comfort zone
[1:58:07] amen
[1:58:08] don't you love him this morning
[1:58:10] I do
[1:58:12] I'm sorry I was
[1:58:13] [Music]
[1:58:16] I just couldn't
[1:58:17] [Music]
[1:58:18] couldn't seem to
[1:58:21] find a
[1:58:23] a place of rest yesterday I
[1:58:26] my wife knows
[1:58:28] I told her I said Sandy on
[1:58:31] I'm so sick one of my boys said well
[1:58:33] call it one of the young Brothers to
[1:58:35] have them preach for us and no I don't
[1:58:37] do that
[1:58:38] I said I'll go to bed early
[1:58:43] I said oh
[1:58:45] I'll get up early
[1:58:49] you love him today
[1:58:51] he's got it all in control
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:59:18] he's got it all I've put my life in his
[1:59:23] hands
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:26] I put my life in his hand
[1:59:34] I put my life in his hands
[1:59:42] every road I walk down
[1:59:53] I put my life
[1:59:56] in his hand heavenly father I thank you
[2:00:00] Lord
[2:00:03] that we have such a confidence in you
[2:00:07] that when our world seems to be falling
[2:00:09] apart and things seem to want to crush
[2:00:12] us on all sides
[2:00:13] but father You Can Be Touched by the
[2:00:17] feeling of our infirmity
[2:00:19] therefore father even before I cry out
[2:00:22] you know
[2:00:24] even before I make it known you know
[2:00:29] but it takes my saying Lord
[2:00:33] with the confession of my own lips
[2:00:36] though God slay me
[2:00:39] yet will I trust him
[2:00:42] though Things Fall Apart around me I
[2:00:45] will trust him
[2:00:50] I have confidence in God not in myself
[2:00:53] not in this world not in this this
[2:00:55] system that we live down here but I
[2:00:58] trust in the system that is to come
[2:01:02] father soon and very soon you're coming
[2:01:04] we can see this thing that's happening
[2:01:07] out right now at Asbury
[2:01:09] and people coming together and
[2:01:11] their lives are not being changed
[2:01:14] [Music]
[2:01:15] they're just being anointed
[2:01:19] they feel your love
[2:01:22] but father if the love would go down
[2:01:24] deep into their hearts they would
[2:01:26] reciprocate and their lives would change
[2:01:30] I pray o God of those that are among
[2:01:33] them
[2:01:34] move in their midst of God
[2:01:37] let the women see what they've done
[2:01:40] wrong the young men let them repent
[2:01:43] I pray o God
[2:01:45] each and every one of God they feel your
[2:01:49] presence but we don't want to feel your
[2:01:51] presence we want to live a life that is
[2:01:54] pleasing to you
[2:01:57] and to please you without faith the
[2:01:59] Bible says it's impossible to please you
[2:02:03] therefore father I pray move upon them
[2:02:05] by faith
[2:02:07] let them rise up o God
[2:02:11] we know the hours late
[2:02:14] and the last one this is not a time to
[2:02:16] play this is not a time to get out from
[2:02:19] behind the word
[2:02:21] it is a time to be steadfast and certain
[2:02:24] of where you belong
[2:02:27] hey man this is a time of placing and
[2:02:31] positioning in Christ
