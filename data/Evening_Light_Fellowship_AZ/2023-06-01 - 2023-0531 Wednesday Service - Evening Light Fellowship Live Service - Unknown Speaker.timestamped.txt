[26:21] and everything and yet what it does is
[26:23] the two of you
[26:25] realize that God still holds you
[26:28] responsible
[26:29] and you treat her as a lady and as your
[26:34] sister and everything and your lives

[34:18] Absalom the son of David had a fair
[34:21] sister whose name was Tamar and amnon
[34:25] the son of David loved her
[34:28] and amnon was so vexed
[34:31] that he felt sick for his sister Tamar
[34:34] what a what a place to be in
[34:39] for she was a virgin and amnon thought
[34:42] it hard for him to do anything to her
[34:46] notice this next little
[34:49] bit here it says but amnam
[34:51] had a friend
[34:53] whose name was Jonah dab and the son of
[34:57] shimia David's brother and Jonah DAV was
[35:01] a very subtle man you may be seated
[35:08] and he said unto him verse 4 just follow
[35:11] along with me why art thou being the
[35:14] King's son lean from day to day well
[35:16] thou not tell me and amnam said unto him
[35:20] I love Tamar my brother absalom's sister
[35:23] now notice the counsel that he receives
[35:27] from Jonah dab Jonah dab being his
[35:29] cousin
[35:31] he doesn't receive the counsel of well
[35:33] you know that's not right and you know
[35:35] you can't have your sister she's your
[35:37] sister you know what the word says you
[35:40] know this you know that but instead
[35:43] rather listen to the counsel that
[35:45] jonadab gives on to him
[35:48] and Jonah dab said unto him lay thee
[35:51] down on thy bed and make thyself sick
[35:54] and when thy father cometh to thee say
[35:57] unto him I pray they let my sister Tamar
[36:00] kamban give me meat and dress the meat
[36:02] in my sight that I may see it and eat it
[36:05] at her hand so Adam laid down and made
[36:08] himself sick
[36:10] it wasn't very hard for amnam to make
[36:13] himself sick because he was already sick
[36:16] with this vexation within his spirit
[36:18] that he loved a girl he should not have
[36:25] so amnam laid down and made himself sick
[36:28] and when the King was come to see him
[36:30] amnam said unto the king uh I pray thee
[36:34] let Tamar come and verse 7 it says and
[36:37] David sent home to Tamar saying go now
[36:40] to thy Brother amnam's house and dress
[36:42] him meat so Tamar went to her brother
[36:45] amnam's house and he was laid down and
[36:49] she took flower and needed it and made
[36:51] cakes in his sight and did bake the
[36:53] cakes and she took a pan and poured them
[36:56] out before him but he refused to eat and
[36:59] amnam said
[37:01] have out all men from me and they went
[37:03] out every man from him
[37:06] and admin said unto Timar bring the meat
[37:08] into the chamber that I may eat of thine
[37:10] hand and Tamar took the cakes which she
[37:13] had made and brought them into the
[37:14] chamber to add them her brother and when
[37:17] she had brought them onto him to eat he
[37:19] took hold of her and said onto onto her
[37:22] come lie with me my sister and she
[37:25] answered him name my brother do not
[37:28] force me for no such thing ought to be
[37:30] done in Israel do not doubt this Folly
[37:33] and I wither shall I cause my shame to
[37:36] go and as for thee Thou shalt be as one
[37:39] of the fools in Israel now therefore I
[37:42] pray thee speak unto thee King for he
[37:44] will not withhold me from thee how be it
[37:47] he would not hearken onto her voice but
[37:49] being stronger than she forced her and
[37:52] lay with her and I'm amnon hated her
[37:55] exceedingly
[37:57] so that the hatred were with he hated
[37:59] her was greater than the love or with he
[38:01] had loved her and amnam said unto her
[38:04] arise be gone see that's what Satan
[38:07] wants to do with each and every one of
[38:09] us whenever he gets what he wants
[38:11] whenever he has his way with us in our
[38:13] lives there's no love there
[38:16] get up and get out of here
[38:20] then he called his servant that
[38:22] ministered onto him and said put now
[38:24] this woman out from me and Bolt the door
[38:25] after her and she had a garment of
[38:28] divers colors upon her for with such
[38:29] robes for the King's Daughters that were
[38:31] virgins apparel then his servant brought
[38:34] her out and bolted the door after her
[38:35] and Tamar pradash is on her head and
[38:37] rent her garments of diverse colors that
[38:40] was on her and laid her hand on her head
[38:43] and went on crying and Absalom her
[38:46] brother said unto her hath amnam thy
[38:48] brother Ben with thee
[38:50] behold thou but hold now thy peace my
[38:54] sister he is thy brother regard not this
[38:58] thing so Tamar remained desolate in the
[39:01] in her brother absalom's house but when
[39:04] the king did when the when King David
[39:06] heard of all these things he was very
[39:09] Ross and Absalom spake on to his brother
[39:12] Amna neither good nor bad for Absalom
[39:14] hated abnam because he had forced his
[39:17] sister Tamar
[39:20] what a portion of scripture
[39:22] a very sobering thought and many lessons
[39:26] that we as uh
[39:29] children of God can learn from this
[39:31] passage of scripture
[39:33] and I would like to title my sermon
[39:36] tonight
[39:37] amnon
[39:39] had a friend
[39:41] it was found there in verse
[39:43] two or three whatever it was
[39:46] amnon had a friend now we find that
[39:49] amnon was the first son of David and
[39:54] being that he was the firstborn no doubt
[39:57] he was very loved by David himself and
[40:01] David would realize and amnon himself as
[40:04] he would grow that the inheritance of
[40:08] David would now pass on to amnon because
[40:11] he was the firstborn son and The
[40:15] Inheritance would belong unto him and
[40:18] when amlam was born to David David was
[40:22] not yet King over Israel but we know
[40:25] that there would come a time that David
[40:27] would be king over Israel and therefore
[40:30] because he was King his firstborn son
[40:32] then would be the next in line to take
[40:35] over the kingdom
[40:36] in Deuteronomy chapter 21 verses 15
[40:40] through 17. it says if a man have two
[40:43] wives one beloved and another hated and
[40:45] they have borne him children both the
[40:47] Beloved and the hated and if the
[40:49] firstborn son be hers that was hated
[40:52] then it shall be when he maketh his sons
[40:55] to inherit that which he has that he may
[40:58] not make the son of the Beloved
[41:00] firstborn before the son of the hated
[41:04] which is indeed the firstborn so what
[41:08] the scripture is trying to tell us is
[41:10] whether one's hated or one's love that
[41:13] has nothing to do with it the
[41:15] inheritance is going to go to the
[41:17] firstborn son
[41:18] but he shall acknowledge the son of the
[41:20] hated for the firstborn by giving him a
[41:23] double portion of all that he hath for
[41:26] he is the beginning of his strength the
[41:29] right of the firstborn
[41:31] is his
[41:34] so we find out that the firstborn son
[41:37] within a family it was given on to them
[41:41] it was their right because they were the
[41:44] firstborn son within the family that a
[41:46] double portion of the inheritance should
[41:48] be given onto that son whether the wife
[41:52] was loved whether the wife was hated
[41:55] whether the son was loved or this son
[41:58] was hated it did not matter because
[42:00] according to the law unto the word of
[42:02] God it was his right to receive the
[42:06] inheritance
[42:08] now we find out that as Sons and
[42:11] Daughters of God now I'm gonna just
[42:14] preach a little bit of happiness here
[42:16] because I can sense the tension
[42:20] you guys are wondering where is he going
[42:23] with this portion of scriptures
[42:26] we are going directly to the heart
[42:29] Hallelujah
[42:31] very interesting when I tried to look up
[42:33] what brother Branham said about Tamar
[42:35] and about amnam he never once mentions
[42:38] their name
[42:40] and I thought my goodness I need a
[42:43] little bit of something a little bit of
[42:45] prophetic Insight here to help me along
[42:48] the way this evening but uh but that's
[42:50] okay so we find out that as first born
[42:54] Sons and Daughters of God that there is
[42:57] an inheritance that is promised to us as
[43:01] first born children now brother Branham
[43:03] would say that God has no grandchildren
[43:06] God has no second born or third born
[43:09] children he only has firstborn children
[43:12] Sons and Daughters of God and because we
[43:16] are firstborn now we can take the word
[43:18] of God and we can say because I am a
[43:22] firstborn son or daughter of God that
[43:25] everything that is written within this
[43:27] word is mine of my inheritance it
[43:31] belongs to me it is mine my name is
[43:34] written all over it therefore I can
[43:36] claim any promise that's written in this
[43:39] word according to me
[43:42] whatever the need is whatever the
[43:45] situation is I can reach out by faith
[43:48] because I realize who I am
[43:51] and when you realize who you are and you
[43:55] realize the inheritance that God has
[43:57] given on to you all things become
[44:00] possible
[44:03] now you might say well I'm a I'm a I'm a
[44:06] girl or I'm a woman does that mean
[44:08] because I'm not a son that I'm not a
[44:10] firstborn the Bible says that there's
[44:12] neither male nor female
[44:15] but we are all in Christ
[44:18] and if you want to break it down even
[44:20] further God has given to us an
[44:23] inheritance as a woman through our Union
[44:26] to Christ therefore everything that's
[44:29] his is mine
[44:32] it leads nobody out it's not just for
[44:35] the man it's not just for the boys but
[44:37] it's for the man the women the boys and
[44:39] the girls it's for whoever has a strong
[44:42] hand of faith that can reach out and
[44:45] take the word of God and claim these
[44:47] promises
[44:53] now notice in that scripture when it's
[44:57] talking about the inheritance it talks
[44:59] about a double portion and I thought
[45:01] this was very interesting uh listen to
[45:04] what brother Branham talks about the
[45:06] double portion here in the way of a true
[45:08] prophet of God 1962. brother Branham
[45:11] says and then he give us all things now
[45:15] we have the earnest of our inheritance
[45:17] now listen close and I ain't preaching
[45:19] on that subject but it just feels good
[45:21] to me right now see that we have the
[45:24] inheritance of that for one day we
[45:27] walked in sin and after being baptized
[45:29] in his name and raised with him in
[45:32] Resurrection we've been brought out of
[45:34] sin never no more to want to go back
[45:37] again and we can all say Amen to that if
[45:40] you've truly been delivered from sin and
[45:42] the bondage that sin brings you can
[45:45] truly say I never want to go back to
[45:48] that life that I once lived
[45:52] he says we're raised from sin but the
[45:54] evidence that we have we're potentially
[45:57] in the resurrection from from all deaths
[46:00] see if we could raise up from sin by
[46:03] faith in him and there is sin who would
[46:06] want to go back to the garbage cans of
[46:09] sin again see we've passed from Death To
[46:12] Life see that's the earnest amen that's
[46:15] the earnest of the complete Resurrection
[46:18] all death physically and spiritually we
[46:21] don't overcome spiritual death because
[46:22] we passed from Death on to life and as
[46:25] Elijah went down to Jordan one day
[46:27] instructed with Elisha and it parted
[46:29] back and he crossed over he come back
[46:32] with the double portion and when we
[46:34] strike Jordan with Christ we got one
[46:37] portion but when we return we're coming
[46:40] with two portions we got eternal life
[46:43] Resurrection from sin now and
[46:45] righteousness with the Holy Ghost and
[46:48] then on the return with Christ we come
[46:51] back with both physical resurrection and
[46:54] we already got spiritual Resurrection we
[46:57] have a double portion of it always a
[46:59] type of Christ in the church Elisha and
[47:03] Elijah
[47:04] and so we can see that Elijah and the
[47:08] church are Elisha and the church it's
[47:10] it's it's a type and we don't have to
[47:12] look very far to see if there's been a
[47:15] double portion that's been poured out on
[47:17] this day all you got to see is the
[47:20] Miracles and the lives and the different
[47:22] things that have been changed and the
[47:24] ministry of the messenger of this hour
[47:26] we can say that we are uh fruits of the
[47:31] ministry of Malachi 4. we are fruits of
[47:34] the ministry of Revelations 10 7 and we
[47:38] can see that there has already been a
[47:40] double portion poured out on the bride
[47:43] of Christ
[47:45] but there will be another double portion
[47:47] because we have a part of it now but
[47:50] when we come back with him on the earth
[47:52] like brother Branham said there's
[47:53] another portion both physically and
[47:56] spiritually
[48:00] now
[48:02] something to notice about amnam
[48:05] it's very interesting when you kind of
[48:08] look at his life and
[48:10] it kind of parallels almost a message
[48:13] believer
[48:15] we find out that amnam was of the Seed
[48:18] of Abraham
[48:20] and Not only was he of the seat of
[48:22] Abraham but amnam was also of a royal
[48:26] seed
[48:27] now put your spiritual thinking caps on
[48:30] because when I talk about amnam
[48:32] throughout the service I want you to put
[48:34] your own name there as a Believer as a
[48:38] believer of the royal Seed of Abraham so
[48:42] when I talk about Adam and I talk about
[48:45] his struggles I'm talking about a
[48:47] believer in this day
[48:55] so we find out that
[48:57] because of the family that amnam was
[49:00] raised in or because of the family that
[49:03] amnam was born in immediately it brought
[49:06] a pressure on his life
[49:09] because he was the son of a king
[49:12] and because he was the son of a king it
[49:15] would automatically mean that amnam
[49:17] would have to live his life in a certain
[49:20] way there was a certain pressure on
[49:23] amnam that he would have to perform on a
[49:25] daily basis there was a certain pressure
[49:28] on amnam that before the people he would
[49:31] have to seem like he was living a
[49:33] perfect life
[49:35] because of amnam was struggling it was a
[49:39] sign that the kingdom that the king of
[49:42] Israel was also struggling if Anthem was
[49:45] having a hard time it would be a
[49:48] reflection upon his father David
[49:51] and so we find out that because he was
[49:54] of royalty and everybody looked at the
[49:58] family of David as royalty we find out
[50:01] that there was this I'll just continue
[50:03] to say pressure there was this burden
[50:06] that was placed upon his life
[50:09] it wasn't something that he desired on
[50:12] his own
[50:13] but it was a pressure that was put on
[50:16] his family and those that were around
[50:18] him it was a pressure that was put on
[50:21] him by the people of Israel that
[50:23] expected him to be perfect
[50:27] a man who was born in sin shaped in
[50:30] iniquity
[50:32] a man who perhaps only had his father
[50:34] around the house once in a while
[50:38] a man that perhaps his mother was the
[50:40] main one that was raising him because
[50:42] his dad was out busy doing other things
[50:46] and here this man was expected to be
[50:49] perfect in all his ways
[50:51] here this man was expected to be of of
[50:55] of of absolutely no fault or no failure
[50:58] because if he had a fault or a failure
[51:00] it was a reflection of his uh his royal
[51:04] family
[51:06] what about you as a believer
[51:10] what about you amnam I'll be the evening
[51:12] Light Fellowship
[51:14] do you feel the pressure of being a
[51:16] message believer do you feel the
[51:18] pressure of being raised in a message
[51:20] family with a standard that has to
[51:23] follow a family
[51:26] do you feel the pressure of having to
[51:28] live far above expectations of how old
[51:31] you are
[51:32] isn't it amazing how that whenever uh uh
[51:36] uh little kids as soon as they they
[51:39] turned to an age of where they can where
[51:41] they can talk and walk around and
[51:43] everything that we expect them to be
[51:45] absolutely perfect
[51:48] we expect them not to answer back we
[51:50] expect this out of them we expect that
[51:52] out of them why because we're message
[51:54] believers
[51:55] we're not no denominational Believers
[51:58] there's nothing that just goes within
[52:00] our household we have a standard that we
[52:03] have to hold and you're going to toe the
[52:05] line
[52:07] and it all it's all a part of being a
[52:10] message believer because God does hold
[52:13] us to a higher standard and God does
[52:16] hold us and put a burden upon us because
[52:19] of the family that we are born in and he
[52:22] does expect us to toe the line
[52:27] but it's a pressure
[52:29] and it's a burden sometimes that a lot
[52:32] of people can't handle
[52:34] let me say this without the baptism of
[52:38] the Holy Ghost in our lives there is
[52:40] absolutely no way for us to toe the line
[52:44] of God's word but it takes an experience
[52:47] with God that when we have an experience
[52:50] with God you don't have to try to do
[52:52] nothing because the life that lays
[52:55] within us now begins to show forth of
[52:58] what it is
[53:00] brother Branham says a sheep doesn't try
[53:03] to Bear wool
[53:04] he doesn't have to manufacture wool he
[53:07] just Bears it
[53:09] that's the difference
[53:11] that's the difference in an experience
[53:13] with God
[53:15] you don't have to try to do anything it
[53:18] just happens
[53:20] so it's very interesting as we as we
[53:23] look at the life of amnam
[53:29] we find that
[53:31] in his life that those things on the
[53:33] outside
[53:34] seem to be going well
[53:37] he was the son of a king and he had
[53:39] everything that he could have ever
[53:41] dreamed of
[53:42] but yet within the heart of amnam
[53:46] there was sin
[53:48] yet within the heart of Anthem there was
[53:50] something that wasn't quite right
[53:53] there was something within him that that
[53:55] that he was actually hiding from the
[53:58] people
[53:59] it was something that he wasn't making
[54:01] known to everybody because he realized
[54:04] that the sin this thought this desire
[54:06] this vexation that I have within me is
[54:09] not normal
[54:12] I shouldn't have it
[54:14] it shouldn't be there because we read in
[54:18] the first couple of verses that he found
[54:21] it hard to do anything to her
[54:25] he knew within himself
[54:27] this thought that I have
[54:29] this desire that I'm hiding from my
[54:33] family
[54:34] this desire that I'm hiding from my
[54:37] friends this desire that I'm hiding from
[54:39] all of Israel I know it shouldn't be
[54:42] there otherwise he would have committed
[54:44] to sin a long time ago
[54:48] but yet he was holding it deep within
[54:51] and it so vexed his spirit that he
[54:56] became sick
[54:59] when you try to hide sin in your life
[55:02] you're going to become sick
[55:08] it was something that he hid very well
[55:12] just like a message believer
[55:15] we can come to church
[55:17] we know how to dress we know how to act
[55:20] we know to come to church 30 minutes
[55:22] early we know the pair ties we know the
[55:24] right things to say and when to say them
[55:30] but
[55:31] I wonder is there any amnames within the
[55:35] assembly this evening
[55:38] that there's a vexation within your
[55:41] spirit there's a vexation within your
[55:44] heart because there's a secret sin
[55:46] laying within there that nobody else
[55:48] knows about
[55:52] and you hide it deep within because
[55:54] you're ashamed to share it with anybody
[55:58] because there's there's an image there
[56:01] was an image that Adam had to keep
[56:04] there was a there was a certain way that
[56:07] he had to look before the people and he
[56:10] could never let it down
[56:12] and if he ever happened to share it with
[56:14] somebody and perhaps it would get out it
[56:16] would absolutely ruin his whole life it
[56:19] would ruin his own image it would ruin
[56:21] everything about him nobody would ever
[56:23] look at him the same again
[56:26] so it is with believers
[56:29] we're ashamed what other people are
[56:31] going to think
[56:32] we're ashamed to share our faults we're
[56:34] ashamed to share our failures because we
[56:37] have this facade
[56:39] that because I'm a message believer I
[56:42] have to be perfect
[56:43] that because I'm a message believer I
[56:46] have to have this image before the
[56:48] people that nothing ever gets me down I
[56:50] never get in any trouble I never have
[56:52] any sin in my life I never have any
[56:54] trials or tribulations everything is
[56:57] perfect
[56:58] what a lie
[57:02] what a lie
[57:04] because we all have faults and we all
[57:07] have failures and we all have things
[57:09] that we struggle with in our lives but
[57:12] because we're so worried about our image
[57:15] because we're so worried about what
[57:17] other people are going to think we hide
[57:19] it deep within
[57:22] and we hide it so well that no one else
[57:25] can notice it until it's too late
[57:30] you might be able to hide what's laying
[57:32] within your heart now but give it time
[57:35] give it time because that life that is
[57:38] within there is going to make manifest
[57:40] at some time in our lives
[57:45] but we try to hide it because I'm
[57:48] ashamed
[57:49] I'm ashamed of my sin
[57:52] I'm ashamed of my feelings I'm ashamed
[57:55] of what's going on in my own private
[57:58] life and how in the world could I share
[58:00] it with anybody else
[58:02] how can I ask for help
[58:05] it's a vexation within my spirit it's a
[58:09] vexation within my heart and I'm sick
[58:15] mistake number one
[58:18] people think
[58:20] the message Believers have to be perfect
[58:23] I've got a lot of nonsense
[58:25] we ain't perfect
[58:29] fault number two
[58:32] is that we tried to hide it for too long
[58:37] and when you hide it for long enough all
[58:39] of a sudden we implode from within
[58:42] and nobody notices it on the outside
[58:45] until it's too late well why didn't you
[58:47] tell me I could have helped you
[58:49] because there's an image that we have to
[58:51] keep saints of God throw down whatever
[58:54] image you think you have
[58:56] whatever facade you think follows you or
[59:00] or whoever you think you are you gotta
[59:02] drop it
[59:04] because if you don't drop it and ask for
[59:06] help it's going to be too late
[59:09] but the moment that we swallow our pride
[59:12] the moment that we put our pride to the
[59:15] side and we say you know what I'm having
[59:17] a hard time
[59:20] things aren't going right in my own
[59:22] personal life and I need a touch from
[59:24] God
[59:27] the moment that you begin to ask for
[59:29] help you know what it does it holds you
[59:31] accountable to that person
[59:34] so now that person because you're the
[59:37] one that reached out that person now can
[59:38] reach out to you and say is everything
[59:40] okay
[59:41] that situation that you told me about
[59:44] are you taking care of it
[59:46] or are you still living and the way that
[59:49] you told me you were living in
[59:51] but if you don't say anything you don't
[59:53] hold yourself accountable to anybody and
[59:56] that is a dangerous place to be in
[1:00:02] the devil wants to get you so low
[1:00:05] and so sinking and sin that he makes you
[1:00:09] doubt the experience that you had with
[1:00:11] God
[1:00:12] well I didn't have no experience with
[1:00:14] God I guess it wasn't real and how can I
[1:00:16] be living this secret life and how can I
[1:00:18] be having these desires Within Myself
[1:00:20] have I had an experience with God
[1:00:26] that's where the devil wants to get you
[1:00:28] too
[1:00:29] and he wants to keep you there because
[1:00:31] he wants to keep you in a defeated State
[1:00:34] he wants to keep you in a state where
[1:00:37] you feel like you'll never overcome the
[1:00:39] situation
[1:00:41] but the good thing is is that once you
[1:00:43] begin to realize on how to overcome a
[1:00:46] situation when more situations come
[1:00:49] because they will come you'll learn how
[1:00:52] to overcome the next one and you'll
[1:00:54] learn how to deal with the next one
[1:00:56] that's the importance of staying in
[1:00:58] fellowship with God because once you get
[1:01:01] out of fellowship with God you're
[1:01:03] defeated
[1:01:06] but when we stay in fellowship with God
[1:01:09] and we focus upon his word it just means
[1:01:12] that when the trials of Life come we
[1:01:15] have our focus on the right thing
[1:01:19] Hallelujah
[1:01:23] they told my mom there uh last week or
[1:01:27] whatever it was they they narrowed this
[1:01:29] thing down these symptoms that she's
[1:01:32] been having and everything to um what's
[1:01:35] that word psoriasis
[1:01:38] cirrhosis I can never remember the word
[1:01:41] cirrhosis of the liver
[1:01:43] so there was three there was three
[1:01:45] doctors that told her you have cancer
[1:01:48] and there's cancer in your blood and we
[1:01:49] don't know where it is and so now six
[1:01:52] months later they're doing more tests
[1:01:54] and they can't find any cancer
[1:01:56] so rather than my mom being excited they
[1:01:59] told her well sixty percent of your
[1:02:01] liver is not working and 40 percent of
[1:02:04] your liver is working so rather than
[1:02:07] taking well I don't have cancer
[1:02:09] and 40 percent of my liver is working
[1:02:13] will praise God
[1:02:15] it's almost half of it it all depends on
[1:02:19] how you look at the situation
[1:02:22] so I have to remind my Mom hey God has
[1:02:26] brought you this far I believe he's
[1:02:28] going to take you even further
[1:02:31] why can I speak like that because I'm in
[1:02:35] fellowship with God and I see the
[1:02:38] promises that's written within his word
[1:02:40] therefore I can encourage those around
[1:02:42] me of those same promises
[1:02:53] so those things may have appeared on the
[1:02:57] outward
[1:02:58] very well for around them yet within his
[1:03:02] life and his own personal life
[1:03:04] he had a vexation that he couldn't
[1:03:06] handle first two it says of Samuel 13
[1:03:10] and amnam was so vexed
[1:03:15] he just wasn't vexed he was so vexed
[1:03:18] within himself he felt sick for his
[1:03:20] sister for she was a virgin and amnam
[1:03:23] thought it hard for him to do anything
[1:03:25] to her
[1:03:27] and them knew that his desire was not
[1:03:31] right
[1:03:33] he knew that whatever thoughts that was
[1:03:36] going through his mind he he knew that
[1:03:39] it wasn't aligning with the word of God
[1:03:42] he knew within himself that
[1:03:45] that kind of thought and that kind of
[1:03:48] desire it it shouldn't have been amongst
[1:03:52] the royalty family of God
[1:03:57] it shouldn't have been there and so he
[1:04:00] fought it
[1:04:01] and he said the Bible said that it was
[1:04:03] hard for him to do anything to her why
[1:04:06] was it so hard for him because he knew
[1:04:09] it was wrong
[1:04:13] how many of you have ever been in that
[1:04:15] place where you absolutely know what's
[1:04:18] wrong
[1:04:18] I know I know I know it but I can't
[1:04:21] contain myself I just can't handle it I
[1:04:24] I can't overcome it therefore I have to
[1:04:26] give in
[1:04:29] God help us
[1:04:33] he was so vexed within himself because
[1:04:36] he was covering it up
[1:04:39] he was so vexed within himself because
[1:04:42] he was hiding it
[1:04:44] and he was imploding from within
[1:04:48] understand you can't hide anything from
[1:04:51] God
[1:04:56] it's very interesting when you look up
[1:04:58] the name of amnam
[1:05:00] and his the meaning of his name it means
[1:05:03] faithful
[1:05:05] and I thought how interesting is this
[1:05:09] how can his name mean faithful but yet
[1:05:11] he has a secret sin in his life
[1:05:14] it doesn't really make sense
[1:05:17] but the more I thought about it the more
[1:05:19] I realized that his outward adoring
[1:05:22] adorning was faithful
[1:05:24] he was faithful to his family he was
[1:05:27] faithful to the crown he was faithful to
[1:05:30] God and the outward appearance but he
[1:05:33] wasn't being faithful within himself
[1:05:37] he was a people pleaser
[1:05:41] that's the matter with some of you
[1:05:43] you care too much about what people
[1:05:45] think
[1:05:48] because you want to please
[1:05:50] because you want everybody else to think
[1:05:52] that you're doing right and there's
[1:05:53] nothing wrong in your life
[1:05:56] amnam
[1:05:58] don't hide it
[1:06:01] because it's going to become a vexation
[1:06:03] in your spirit and make you sick
[1:06:10] told you we were going to speak to the
[1:06:12] heart
[1:06:17] message Believers are so good at hiding
[1:06:19] things these days
[1:06:22] because we're so worried about what
[1:06:23] everybody else thinks
[1:06:26] so worried about our image
[1:06:30] or so worried about this and we're so
[1:06:32] worried about that
[1:06:33] when really we're not worried about
[1:06:35] what's going on within and how to fix it
[1:06:42] we can only get so far on the adorning
[1:06:45] of the outward appearance
[1:06:47] we can only get so far with being
[1:06:49] faithful to the exterior things but at a
[1:06:53] certain time and at a certain season the
[1:06:56] inward man is going to catch up
[1:06:59] and before we know it everybody will
[1:07:01] know
[1:07:02] the secret that is laying within our
[1:07:04] hearts that we've been covering up
[1:07:06] for so long
[1:07:10] why not just take care of it
[1:07:14] why not just take it for what it is and
[1:07:17] ask for help
[1:07:19] why not just say this is where I'm
[1:07:21] having a really great issue
[1:07:24] I need help
[1:07:27] because if I don't get help I'm going to
[1:07:30] sink mayday mayday mayday
[1:07:33] we're sinking
[1:07:35] the ship is sinking if you never cry
[1:07:38] Mayday no one's ever going to come to
[1:07:40] your help
[1:07:42] but if you cry out for help there's no
[1:07:44] better place to ask for help than a
[1:07:46] church
[1:07:49] there's no better people to ask for help
[1:07:51] than the Bride of Jesus Christ there's
[1:07:54] nobody else better to ask for help than
[1:07:56] your pastor
[1:07:58] there's nobody better to ask for help
[1:08:01] help me
[1:08:03] I'm drowning
[1:08:06] and I am fixed
[1:08:09] we'll notice the further that you read
[1:08:12] about his life
[1:08:15] that he was so vexed and he didn't deal
[1:08:16] with it
[1:08:18] that it didn't only affect his life
[1:08:20] but it affected Tamar
[1:08:23] it affected Absalom
[1:08:26] it affected David
[1:08:28] it affected those of his Gatekeepers who
[1:08:31] could who kept the secret
[1:08:33] it affects everybody
[1:08:35] all because they wouldn't deal with the
[1:08:39] issue
[1:08:40] my brother my sister humble yourselves
[1:08:43] before God
[1:08:45] humble yourselves and he'll lift you up
[1:08:47] humble yourselves and ask for help let
[1:08:51] me speak to your hearts
[1:08:54] you say well I'm not there today brother
[1:08:56] Stephen perhaps someday you will be
[1:08:59] there will be a time when you're going
[1:09:01] to need help don't be scared to ask for
[1:09:04] it
[1:09:09] James chapter 1 verses 13 through 15.
[1:09:12] let no man say when he is tempted I am
[1:09:15] tempted of God for God cannot be tempted
[1:09:17] with evil neither tempteth he any man
[1:09:19] but every man is tempted when he is
[1:09:21] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[1:09:24] then when lust is conceived it bringeth
[1:09:26] forth sin and sin when it is finished
[1:09:28] bringeth forth death
[1:09:31] the Bible it says that when a man is
[1:09:35] uh
[1:09:36] it says when every man is tempted he is
[1:09:39] drawn away
[1:09:40] what is he drawn away from when he is
[1:09:42] tempted he is drawn away from the word
[1:09:45] of God he is drawn away from his
[1:09:48] relationship with Jesus Christ he's
[1:09:51] drawn away from reading and praying and
[1:09:54] spending a a personal time with God
[1:09:56] himself why is he drawn away from these
[1:10:00] things because he's drawn away of his
[1:10:02] own lusts
[1:10:05] it's very interesting when you look at
[1:10:08] the word lust we find out that the word
[1:10:12] lust it means a desire
[1:10:14] a craving or a longing especially for
[1:10:18] what is forbidden
[1:10:21] so what is it that's within us that is
[1:10:24] lusting and Desiring and craving for
[1:10:26] these forbidden things it's your carnal
[1:10:29] man it's your carnal nature
[1:10:32] so first of all we have this lust this
[1:10:36] craving this desire and understand
[1:10:39] people think about they think about a
[1:10:42] man lusting towards a woman but the word
[1:10:45] lust is not only uh implicated towards
[1:10:48] for a man to a woman
[1:10:50] but it's towards anything that is
[1:10:53] forbidden
[1:10:56] Eve's lust was full it wasn't for some
[1:10:59] forbidden fruit but it was it was for uh
[1:11:02] for her own reasoning that she might
[1:11:04] know good from Evil and she might be as
[1:11:07] a God that was her desire that was her
[1:11:10] longing and when the devil gave her that
[1:11:13] that uh that that forbidden fruit if you
[1:11:17] say
[1:11:17] the craving he he absolutely satisfied
[1:11:21] her for what she was craving
[1:11:23] and had brought sin into her life
[1:11:27] understand whatever this flesh man this
[1:11:30] guy here
[1:11:31] whatever he craves on a daily basis
[1:11:34] Satan's gonna give it to you
[1:11:36] if you just open up your spirit if you
[1:11:39] just open up your mind in your heart and
[1:11:41] you say oh I just really wish that I
[1:11:43] could have this Satan will give you the
[1:11:45] Cravings of your carnal man
[1:11:51] what does he do he entices us
[1:11:54] we're drawn away by our own cravings and
[1:11:57] our own desires but because of that now
[1:11:59] we are enticed
[1:12:02] so what does the word entice mean
[1:12:06] the word enticed means to catch by bait
[1:12:10] to Allure are to beguile
[1:12:13] so what Satan does now he uses your
[1:12:17] longings
[1:12:18] your desires the things that this carnal
[1:12:21] man is craving after and he uses it as a
[1:12:25] bait
[1:12:26] and he puts it out there for every one
[1:12:29] of us to take that when we take the bait
[1:12:32] guess what we're captured
[1:12:37] why
[1:12:38] because we've been drawn away our Focus
[1:12:40] has been taken off the word of God and
[1:12:43] we've been drawn away in our Focus now
[1:12:44] is towards worldly things ever wonder
[1:12:47] why you can't overcome because you're
[1:12:49] focusing on the wrong things
[1:12:55] so we're drawn away from the word we're
[1:12:58] drawn away from the street and narrow
[1:13:00] Way by a desire or a craving that we
[1:13:03] have within our carnal man for those
[1:13:06] things which are forbidden for the
[1:13:09] Christian to partake of
[1:13:12] for the Christian
[1:13:15] he said well what's forbidden to me as a
[1:13:16] Christian read your Bible
[1:13:18] you don't have to wait for the preacher
[1:13:21] to tell you
[1:13:23] read the word let the Holy Ghost speak
[1:13:26] to our hearts and say my this craving in
[1:13:29] this desire I have is not according to a
[1:13:32] son or a daughter of God
[1:13:35] God help me
[1:13:41] so what happens when we're enticed and
[1:13:44] we're we take the bait per se
[1:13:47] when we take the bait and we eat of that
[1:13:49] which is forbidden it brings forth sin
[1:13:54] and When sin is in our life it brings
[1:13:56] forth death
[1:13:58] not only will it bring forth a spiritual
[1:14:01] death in our lives right now but it'll
[1:14:03] bring forth death
[1:14:06] because if we go against if we bring uh
[1:14:09] what is it
[1:14:11] have we bring if if we ruin the
[1:14:13] testimony of Jesus Christ as Believers
[1:14:17] this is paraphrasing it brother Branham
[1:14:19] said that God will take us off the scene
[1:14:23] why because we're bringing a reproach to
[1:14:26] the word and to the name of Christ
[1:14:30] so not only does it bring forth a
[1:14:32] spiritual death right here right now but
[1:14:35] it'll bring forth a physical death why
[1:14:37] because we're drawn away from the word
[1:14:40] by our own lust and enticed
[1:14:43] it's exactly what happened to amnon
[1:14:47] the thought was in his mind for Lord
[1:14:49] knows how long
[1:14:51] it was in his heart but he knew enough
[1:14:53] not to partake he knew enough not to
[1:14:56] chase after it he knew enough to know
[1:14:59] that it was wrong
[1:15:01] but I'm them had a friend
[1:15:05] Adam had a friend I wonder how many
[1:15:08] people if you were to ask them well when
[1:15:09] did you start smoking
[1:15:11] well I had a friend in school when did
[1:15:14] you start doing pot well I had a friend
[1:15:16] at school when did you start going off
[1:15:19] the deep end well I had a friend and you
[1:15:22] could call that friend by name
[1:15:24] choose your friends wisely I don't care
[1:15:28] how old you are I don't care how young
[1:15:31] you are but friends are an important
[1:15:33] factor in our lives
[1:15:37] show me your friends and husband said
[1:15:40] and I'll show you your future
[1:15:43] but on them had one of these friends
[1:15:47] I kind of feel sorry for him a little
[1:15:49] bit
[1:15:53] because he was so miserable within his
[1:15:55] Spirit he was probably miserable in
[1:15:57] church but he was miserable in the world
[1:15:59] he was miserable everywhere he went
[1:16:02] because of the sin that was in his life
[1:16:04] and the one time that he opens up to
[1:16:06] somebody
[1:16:07] the one time that he opens up to a
[1:16:10] family member his cousin Jonah dab guess
[1:16:13] what happens expecting the right kind of
[1:16:16] counsel he tells them everything that
[1:16:19] his flesh man wanted to hear
[1:16:24] I ain't no friend
[1:16:27] that ain't nobody that you want to have
[1:16:29] that you want to share things with
[1:16:31] somebody that's going to give you the
[1:16:33] wrong kind of counsel
[1:16:35] but that's the kind of friends that he
[1:16:37] associated with
[1:16:39] hey I got a plan and this is good and
[1:16:43] you're going to like it he's going to
[1:16:45] pretend to be sick and you're going to
[1:16:46] do these things and your dad yeah he's
[1:16:48] going to believe you and he and he's
[1:16:50] going to think you're sick and he has
[1:16:51] absolutely no idea when she comes in
[1:16:53] this is what you're going to do
[1:16:57] what up
[1:16:59] a dirty dog
[1:17:03] huh
[1:17:04] that's an Irish expression I don't know
[1:17:06] if you say that here
[1:17:09] Dirty Dog
[1:17:11] huh here he was he's supposed to be this
[1:17:13] guy's friend
[1:17:15] here he is he's supposed to be family
[1:17:16] with this guy
[1:17:19] but he tells him everything that is
[1:17:21] flesh man wants to hear
[1:17:24] brother James loveball has said it time
[1:17:27] and time again from the pulpit brother
[1:17:29] Ron don't tell me what I want to hear
[1:17:31] tell me what I need to hear that's what
[1:17:34] a true friend does and that's what a
[1:17:36] true friend expects out of their friends
[1:17:39] tell me the truth tell me where I'm
[1:17:42] going wrong tell me when I'm going to
[1:17:44] make the wrong choice so I don't go down
[1:17:46] that road don't just tickle my ears and
[1:17:49] tell me what I want to hear
[1:17:52] God give us more friends like that give
[1:17:55] us more people with an attitude like
[1:17:58] that that when they come for counsel
[1:18:00] brother Ron has said it he goes a lot of
[1:18:02] times people will come for counsel
[1:18:04] already with their minds made up
[1:18:08] I've had it myself I've had somebody
[1:18:11] come and unless you tell them exactly
[1:18:13] what they want to hear they say well
[1:18:15] your counsel is not good
[1:18:18] give a counsel to somebody one time
[1:18:21] did not like it
[1:18:23] um
[1:18:24] told him straight
[1:18:26] straight into the point wasn't rude
[1:18:29] straight as a friend should
[1:18:32] friendship really wasn't the same after
[1:18:35] that for a while which is fine
[1:18:38] I felt okay
[1:18:40] it was on him
[1:18:43] his problem was I didn't tell him what
[1:18:45] he wanted to hear
[1:18:47] two years later he came and he told me
[1:18:49] you remember when you told me such and
[1:18:51] such in the car yes sir I do I hated
[1:18:54] every word of it but it was the truth
[1:18:58] took him two years to get over it but he
[1:19:01] got over it
[1:19:03] so it happens
[1:19:05] people only want to receive counsel when
[1:19:08] it's what they want to hear but if we
[1:19:10] would come with an open mind if we would
[1:19:13] come with a sincere heart and if we
[1:19:15] would come with not our already our
[1:19:17] minds made up now God can use the gift
[1:19:20] God can anoint the gift and give you the
[1:19:24] counsel that you need to receive but
[1:19:26] you've got to be open and willing to
[1:19:28] receive the counsel
[1:19:32] otherwise it'll do you no good
[1:19:34] you know the word of God
[1:19:36] the Eternal Word of God can do you
[1:19:39] absolutely no good unless you let it
[1:19:44] zero
[1:19:45] because it'll just be words
[1:19:48] it'll just be something that goes in one
[1:19:50] ear and out the other
[1:19:52] but when you let the word of God have an
[1:19:55] effect in your life and you say Lord
[1:19:57] that's done Lord that hurt but it is
[1:20:01] your word and I accept it guess what
[1:20:05] will happen the word of God will have an
[1:20:07] effect on your daily life
[1:20:11] but you've got to let it
[1:20:15] got to let God have his way
[1:20:17] God's not going to take his way in your
[1:20:20] life
[1:20:21] but you've got to let him have his way
[1:20:25] because he's a gentleman
[1:20:28] God don't take anything from us
[1:20:33] but he expects us to give it to him
[1:20:37] and when we give our hearts to him
[1:20:40] that's when he can really move on our
[1:20:42] lives
[1:20:44] Hallelujah
[1:20:45] but you've got to let it
[1:20:48] you've got to let the gift have its way
[1:20:51] in your life
[1:20:53] you've got to let the word have its way
[1:20:55] in your life because if you don't let it
[1:20:59] if you don't listen to the council if
[1:21:01] you come with a closed mind already it
[1:21:04] can do nothing for you
[1:21:08] what a lesson we can learn from this
[1:21:12] that if we'll approach the right way
[1:21:16] and if we approach the gift in the right
[1:21:19] way I believe that God will be obligated
[1:21:23] to give you the answer that you need not
[1:21:27] the answer that you want
[1:21:32] amen
[1:21:36] so amnam
[1:21:38] he had this friend
[1:21:41] huh
[1:21:43] and you know it's kind of interesting
[1:21:47] it's a friend that each and every one of
[1:21:49] you have
[1:21:53] and it's a friend that you know very
[1:21:56] well
[1:21:57] and his name his spiritual name is
[1:22:00] called amnam
[1:22:03] amen
[1:22:05] how can we learn from these things
[1:22:08] she's your friends wisely
[1:22:11] and choose who you counsel with
[1:22:14] wisely
[1:22:18] the person first be proved that they're
[1:22:20] a a good listener and they know to keep
[1:22:22] their mouths shut
[1:22:27] then
[1:22:28] Reach Out
[1:22:30] Hallelujah Amos chapter 3 verse 3 can
[1:22:34] two walk together except they be agreed
[1:22:37] First Corinthians 15 and 33 be not
[1:22:41] deceived evil Communications corrupt
[1:22:44] good manners
[1:22:49] each of us
[1:22:51] have two friends in our lives
[1:22:55] we have a friend
[1:22:57] spiritual on them
[1:22:59] and he lives a lot closer with you than
[1:23:01] what you think
[1:23:03] it's not a friend of the flesh
[1:23:06] at least I hope you don't have a friend
[1:23:08] of the flesh let down them
[1:23:12] but you have a friend of your flesh
[1:23:15] who's called amnam
[1:23:18] and on a daily basis he's telling you
[1:23:21] the wrong things to say
[1:23:22] he's telling you the wrong places to go
[1:23:25] he's given you the wrong thoughts within
[1:23:27] your mind and he is agreeing with
[1:23:30] absolutely everything that your flesh
[1:23:32] man desires that is contrary to the word
[1:23:36] of God and that is your flesh carnal man
[1:23:40] he is the one that speaks to your mind
[1:23:43] he is the one that gives you these
[1:23:46] desires these Earthly desires and
[1:23:48] Pleasures that you think you really
[1:23:50] really really want
[1:23:53] he is the friend that you need to be
[1:23:55] careful of
[1:23:57] he is the friend that'll get you into
[1:23:59] trouble
[1:24:00] but he'll never get you out of trouble
[1:24:04] we'll read that about Jonah dapp I'll
[1:24:07] just say it it's kind of interesting
[1:24:09] with Jonah Dell so the whole thing
[1:24:12] happens and two years later
[1:24:14] Absalom says nothing to his brother he
[1:24:16] has a hatred for him I hate him so much
[1:24:19] that I won't say anything good to him
[1:24:21] and I won't say anything bad to him but
[1:24:24] I will get my vengeance
[1:24:26] and so we realized that two years later
[1:24:29] Absalom goes to David his father and he
[1:24:31] says let us all get together I want to
[1:24:33] get everybody together and and this and
[1:24:35] that and he says well and and Absalom
[1:24:37] absolutely presses his father
[1:24:40] because his father David says well what
[1:24:42] if something happens and All My Sons be
[1:24:44] slain
[1:24:45] oh nothing's gonna happen dad just just
[1:24:47] let us all go
[1:24:49] we know the story
[1:24:51] that Absalom had his servants whenever
[1:24:54] amnam's heart was married with wine
[1:24:58] thought he was in a good place
[1:25:00] thought he'd gotten away with it
[1:25:03] there was no real correction from David
[1:25:08] he thought he was in a place where hey
[1:25:10] everything's good
[1:25:12] I got my way with Tamar she's living in
[1:25:15] absalom's house I'd never see her nobody
[1:25:18] ever sees her it's it's not even there
[1:25:20] it didn't even happen but Absalom didn't
[1:25:22] forget
[1:25:24] Absalom had him slew
[1:25:26] had him murdered so because of the the
[1:25:29] the Council of jonadab to amnam
[1:25:34] he caught he absolutely ruined
[1:25:37] Tamar's life
[1:25:39] she was alone in her brother's house
[1:25:41] probably until the day she died because
[1:25:44] of the shame of what happened
[1:25:47] she could no longer longer wear her her
[1:25:49] her cloak of being a virgin with pride
[1:25:54] but it was rent because he had taken
[1:25:57] something from her that she should have
[1:25:59] give to somebody
[1:26:02] does that make sense
[1:26:05] it's so sacred that it should never be
[1:26:07] taken
[1:26:09] but it should be freely given by love
[1:26:12] from a girl
[1:26:16] but it was taken from her
[1:26:18] and it was something that she could
[1:26:19] never get back
[1:26:21] there was something that she was marred
[1:26:22] with for the rest of her life
[1:26:25] why because of the choice of a man and
[1:26:27] because of the counsel of another man
[1:26:30] turned Absalom into a murderer
[1:26:33] amnam was a rapist
[1:26:35] it can go on and on why because of the
[1:26:38] bad counsel
[1:26:40] of a friend
[1:26:42] but I am them had a friend
[1:26:48] and we realized that whenever word had
[1:26:51] come back to David David thought oh my
[1:26:53] all my children are dead and honey
[1:26:55] begins to cry and who was right there
[1:26:57] beside David
[1:27:00] his nephew
[1:27:02] let's just read it
[1:27:04] because it's very very interesting uh
[1:27:07] verses 32-33 and Jonah dabbed the sum of
[1:27:11] uh shimmy uh David's brother answered
[1:27:14] and said let not my Lord suppose that
[1:27:16] they have slain all the young men the
[1:27:18] king's Sons for amnam only as dead
[1:27:23] it's kind of how I read it it's only
[1:27:25] amnam it's only it's not all your sons
[1:27:28] that's only him
[1:27:31] but wait a second I thought you were his
[1:27:34] friend
[1:27:36] that's only Adam don't worry King
[1:27:40] listen what he says for Adam only is
[1:27:42] dead for by the appointment of Absalom
[1:27:44] this has been determined from the day
[1:27:47] that he forced his sister taymore
[1:27:50] he didn't sell
[1:27:52] I was the one that told him to do it he
[1:27:54] puts all the blame on Absalom
[1:27:56] are on on amnam
[1:28:00] he didn't say it was my counsel that
[1:28:02] made him do this it was it was it was
[1:28:04] kind of my fault and I'm so sorry I'm
[1:28:06] the one that caused all this he says
[1:28:07] since he did that to Tamar guess what he
[1:28:10] deserved this from that day forth it's
[1:28:12] okay
[1:28:14] what a friend
[1:28:16] it could care less
[1:28:19] verse 33 now therefore let not my Lord
[1:28:22] the king Take the thing to his heart
[1:28:25] to think that all the king's sons are
[1:28:28] dead for amnam only
[1:28:31] as dead
[1:28:34] he could care less
[1:28:37] this is the guy
[1:28:39] that you deal with on a daily basis
[1:28:43] this is the guy that says he's your
[1:28:46] friend
[1:28:48] but yet he could care less
[1:28:51] he could care less about your spiritual
[1:28:54] life with God he could care less about
[1:28:57] your spiritual temperature and how
[1:28:59] you're doing at church and how you're
[1:29:01] doing in your family life and how you're
[1:29:03] he could care less all he cares about is
[1:29:06] one thing and that's partaking of those
[1:29:10] things which are forbidden
[1:29:15] but you also have another friend
[1:29:17] you have a friend who sticks closer than
[1:29:20] a brother
[1:29:21] you have a friend who said I will never
[1:29:23] leave Thee the normal I ever forsake
[1:29:26] thee but I'll always be with thee it
[1:29:29] isn't just some some figure or some man
[1:29:31] but it's God himself the creator of
[1:29:35] heavens and earth he is the one that
[1:29:37] promised it and he is the one that is
[1:29:39] fulfilling his word in our lives
[1:29:43] as the musicians come
[1:29:46] so all of you realize including myself
[1:29:50] and I'm very aware of it
[1:29:53] did I have two friends in my life
[1:29:56] two spiritual people
[1:29:59] and one is trying to get me to do good
[1:30:02] and the other one is trying to get me
[1:30:06] to do evil
[1:30:09] these are friends that perhaps you don't
[1:30:12] have any choice well you do with the
[1:30:15] Lord I suppose well really you don't
[1:30:17] because you're predestined to it
[1:30:19] but you still have to make a choice
[1:30:22] you have these two friends in your lives
[1:30:26] and they're a completely opposite one to
[1:30:28] another
[1:30:30] but there's one thing that we can do as
[1:30:32] believers
[1:30:34] now we can make a choice
[1:30:37] of who we're listening to
[1:30:41] the choice is yours
[1:30:43] and that's the battle
[1:30:46] that's the war that rages within our
[1:30:48] members that whenever I want to do good
[1:30:50] evil is with me and and whenever I want
[1:30:52] to do this and that I don't want to the
[1:30:54] things that I don't want to do those are
[1:30:56] the things that I do and I'm just a
[1:30:57] reservable miserable Wretched Man and
[1:31:01] but I'm just so vexed at myself
[1:31:06] but understand
[1:31:07] you have a choice
[1:31:09] of who you're going to listen to
[1:31:13] now let me ask the question
[1:31:16] who are you listening to
[1:31:19] what friend are you listening to the
[1:31:21] most
[1:31:23] because the friend that you listen to
[1:31:25] the most on a daily basis is going to be
[1:31:28] your better friend
[1:31:30] the friend that you stay in contact with
[1:31:33] on a daily basis
[1:31:35] he's going to be the one that you're
[1:31:37] closer to
[1:31:38] the one that you have fellowship with
[1:31:41] day and night the one that you call up
[1:31:43] on the phone and you talk to them for a
[1:31:45] while the one that you talk to hey guess
[1:31:48] what he's going to be your closest
[1:31:49] friend
[1:31:54] so who do you spend the most time with
[1:31:59] who have you been yielding your members
[1:32:00] to the most
[1:32:02] is it Jonah down
[1:32:06] is it this guy that that wants to put
[1:32:10] everything before your face that's for
[1:32:12] forbidden
[1:32:13] who knows the Cravings he knows the
[1:32:15] things that makes you tick who knows the
[1:32:18] things that you enjoy in your life
[1:32:19] that's going to take you away from God
[1:32:23] are you more friendly with the one who
[1:32:27] wants to be your friend in the good
[1:32:28] times
[1:32:30] and in the bad times
[1:32:32] the one who wants to be your friend
[1:32:34] whether you're living good or you're
[1:32:35] living bad
[1:32:36] the one who wants to be your friend that
[1:32:39] whether you've got a lot of money or
[1:32:41] you're broke
[1:32:44] because he's not after your material
[1:32:46] things but he's after you because of
[1:32:49] your character and he loves you because
[1:32:51] of who you are
[1:32:54] quite a sobering thought
[1:32:57] because we realize that our friends are
[1:33:00] the ones that influence us the most
[1:33:04] whether good
[1:33:06] or whether bad
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:09] and so your life and my life right at
[1:33:12] this very moment
[1:33:14] as a Telltale sign of who our best
[1:33:16] friend is
[1:33:20] because it's influencing our lives in
[1:33:23] one way or another
[1:33:26] and perhaps you're saying this evening
[1:33:29] my goodness
[1:33:32] thanks
[1:33:34] I got this issue in my life like this
[1:33:37] and I'm not and hey guess what you don't
[1:33:40] gotta listen to Jordan
[1:33:43] you don't gotta listen to everything
[1:33:45] that he tries to put in your mind
[1:33:47] but rather you can keep your focus on
[1:33:49] God
[1:33:51] and when Jonah dab is here
[1:33:53] and he's talking
[1:33:55] and he's talking
[1:33:57] he's never gonna shut up
[1:34:00] until you focus on the other person
[1:34:03] then this is just noise
[1:34:06] so saints of God God help us
[1:34:10] to take a real inventory in our lives
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:14] starting from the pulpit
[1:34:16] the whole way to the back of the church
[1:34:20] maybe look at ourselves and say
[1:34:23] yeah it's true
[1:34:25] it's true I'm not perfect
[1:34:28] and it's true I have faults in my life
[1:34:31] and it's true that I have a Jonah dab
[1:34:34] but it's also true
[1:34:37] that I got this other one in my life who
[1:34:39] wants nothing but what's best for me
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:45] it's kind of a no-brainer
[1:34:49] so how about this evening
[1:34:51] you choose the way of the Lord
[1:34:55] you choose
[1:34:56] the way with the Lord's despised few
[1:35:00] no matter what your image says or no
[1:35:02] matter what any about that other stuff
[1:35:04] choose this day who you're going to
[1:35:08] serve and not just serve with a
[1:35:10] half-hearted heart but serve holy and
[1:35:14] serve fully with a God-fearing love that
[1:35:18] you have for our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:35:20] let's Stand Together
[1:35:24] let me be pleased
[1:35:28] [Music]
