[12:32] in prayer, Brother Steven Manard wanted
[12:34] me to mention his car was stolen on I
[12:35] believe it was Monday or when he came
[12:37] back from camp and he just prayed that
[12:39] the Lord would restore it unto him and

[12:43] back and minimal damage. So we just want
[12:45] to give the Lord praise for that as
[12:51] well. Let's just bow our heads and our
[12:54] hearts
[12:55] together.
[12:57] Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[13:01] count it a great honor to be gathered
[13:03] again once again in your house, Father,

[13:10] you're worthy of it all. And Lord, in
[13:12] the good times, we praise you. In the
[13:14] bad times, we praise you. And Lord,
[13:16] through the trials, through the ups and
[13:18] the downs, we want to give you thanks,
[13:20] Lord. Lord, even just a return car. Oh
[13:23] God, we just want to Lord, many times we
[13:25] go through things and we don't
[13:27] understand it all. But Father, you know
[13:29] all things and we just want to say thank
[13:31] you for being so good to us,
[13:33] Lord. And you see these needs that have
[13:36] come before this desk. Lord, I'm sure
[13:39] there's many more across the hearts of
[13:40] your people. And Lord, we're just asking
[13:43] that you would come and you would meet
[13:45] them according to your will and to your
[13:47] purpose. Father, may you have your way.
[13:49] And even in this service, may you walk
[13:52] the aisles, Lord, on this mid midweek
[13:54] service. Lord, may we set aside the
[13:57] cares of life and the things that so
[13:59] easily beset us and let us run the race
[14:01] that is set before us. Oh God, we just

[33:39] before he draw, he have something in his
[33:43] mind. He had something that he created
[33:46] already in his mind. That's why I was
[33:48] preaching last time about the the the
[33:52] masterpiece. But then the prophet said,
[33:54] "You cannot draw a cow eating grass on
[33:58] the top of the tree."
[34:00] So, my heart's desire tonight is to show
[34:04] you the the the right uh drawing that
[34:09] you will see that oh I I I I was there
[34:13] and here is the big great family of God
[34:17] sitting in a heavenly places. Amen. So,
[34:21] that is my heart's desire to draw a
[34:24] picture in your mind that you will
[34:26] rejoice and you will praise God tonight.
[34:31] uh pray for me. I will be leaving
[34:34] tomorrow uh to Mexico. There will be a
[34:38] uh youth fellowship in Baja California.
[34:41] So I'll be back uh Sunday night. I will
[34:45] fly from San Diego to Phoenix. Um I have
[34:50] two videos to show and I can share this
[34:54] testimony. Uh brothers, are you ready?
[34:58] So this was in Pakistan last year.
[35:30] will find it that there will be a
[35:32] missing
[35:33] piece. The husband will mark her as a
[35:37] prostitute.
[35:53] I don't want to be marked as a
[35:55] prostitute.
[36:01] [Music]
[36:04] I want to be marked as a virtuous bride
[36:08] of Jesus Christ. Will find it that there
[36:11] will be dear brother
[36:15] From the bottom of our
[36:17] hearts, we are thankful to
[36:20] you and you in our midst,
[36:24] in our church,
[36:26] preach the word of God by
[36:31] which we received a lot of
[36:34] blessings and may God bless
[36:39] you and we would like to listen you
[36:42] again, sir.
[36:44] God bless you all. Brother Warren, this
[36:46] is Pastor Akmal giving you his heartfelt
[36:50] warm greetings. And this is all of the
[36:53] congregation.
[36:55] [Applause]
[36:58] God bless you, brother. God bless you.
[37:00] Hallelujah. God bless you so much.
[37:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[37:05] Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:08] [Applause]
[37:13] Okay. So the testimony
[37:16] was from Lahour. We drove almost 3 hours
[37:21] to that place in Saruda. So, Sar Guda,
[37:25] it's a uh very close to a military base.
[37:31] And when I got there, they won't allow
[37:34] me because the
[37:37] military won't accept a foreigners to be
[37:42] there. Um, they thought I was a an Asian
[37:46] spy.
[37:47] So,
[37:49] so, so they put me, they put me to a
[37:54] house not far from
[37:57] Saruda. They put me to a house and I was
[38:01] preaching there in Zoom
[38:03] meetings because of that uh military
[38:07] base. So last week or last
[38:11] May they bombed that air
[38:14] base and thank the Lord there was no
[38:19] believers
[38:21] was damaged their churches or their
[38:23] houses or somebody killed. So God
[38:26] protected the believers
[38:28] and uh Lord willing, brother Zachary
[38:32] Wallace and me will fly back to uh
[38:36] Pakistan this coming October. So pray
[38:38] for me. This is my prayer that I will uh
[38:42] see them
[38:43] again. Um so
[38:48] uh we'll read the message. Uh I will
[38:52] start. I I I'm not really a good
[38:56] preacher. So, but uh right now uh your
[39:01] son is here, Brother John.
[39:04] Yes. So, you you say hi to brother Von
[39:07] Garvin over there. Amen. Um the the
[39:12] message said in
[39:16] 1963 he said
[39:20] then I wonder in this day if this loose
[39:25] lazy soft laudysian age that we live in
[39:30] we all know and have been uh through the
[39:34] a church ages that we're living in the
[39:37] last age the Laudysian
[39:42] church. Amen.
[39:45] Now he said, "What is the Laudysian
[39:48] church age?" And this is
[39:51] lazy, loose, happy golucky, joking,
[39:56] sinful age of lust that we're living in
[40:00] now.
[40:02] It's a
[40:04] wonder that God doesn't just say, "Step
[40:08] back church. I'll just liquidate the
[40:12] whole group." Amen. Amen. So because
[40:17] brother Barley, you should be preaching
[40:20] here. Amen.
[40:23] So you know the grace of God because of
[40:27] this this this precious believers in the
[40:30] last days. God is holding his wrath
[40:36] because of you and me
[40:38] because you can stand from that demon
[40:42] oppression.
[40:44] God gave you power to overcome.
[40:49] Amen. Another
[40:51] message
[40:53] 1956 the junction of
[40:55] time he said and if they have been
[40:58] through all these things when all the
[41:01] world history is climaxing in this great
[41:06] drama what's the matter what makes
[41:09] people so
[41:11] nervous why why is it even
[41:16] psychiatrist are coming to the to be
[41:19] prayed For
[41:21] why is it the world is in a nervous age,
[41:28] a neurotic age when people can't
[41:33] wait or
[41:35] ra to drive
[41:38] fast
[41:39] down the street 90 miles an hour. Stop
[41:44] at the beer to join two hours before
[41:47] they go home.
[41:49] run over people. My What's the matter?
[41:55] What's the matter? Sometimes we wake up
[41:57] early in the morning to go to to to to
[42:00] work, but then you check your your your
[42:03] your social media, who likes your post,
[42:07] who did something commented to your to
[42:10] your uh uh good words that you
[42:13] put and then you found out, oh, I'm
[42:17] late. So now you will drive 90 miles an
[42:21] hour. We're not drinking. We're talking
[42:23] to uh he was talking to us. That's
[42:26] right.
[42:28] But this is the
[42:31] age even the psychiatrist psychiatrist
[42:35] are looking for something need help.
[42:38] Who will help them except God will help
[42:41] them. You know they went to science.
[42:44] They were they were studying about the
[42:46] brain about the the about the the
[42:48] condition of
[42:50] humans but they cannot help themselves.
[42:54] Right, brother James? They cannot help
[42:56] themselves.
[42:59] They're longing for something. They're
[43:00] thirsty. They need a salt.
[43:06] Amen.
[43:09] Now the prophet
[43:11] said when when the battle fought over
[43:14] there in heaven there was a a hundreds
[43:18] of thousands of thousands of demon was
[43:21] kicked
[43:22] out and the purpose of that is to
[43:26] destroy you. Hundreds of thousands and
[43:29] thousands of demons. Millions of
[43:33] demons to destroy you. But the Bible
[43:37] said 10,000 will be in my right hand and
[43:39] 10,000 to another left hand. I still I
[43:44] still excel. I still stand up. Amen.
[43:48] Because God is with us. Amen.
[43:53] Amen.
[43:56] Now, so the the the the Bible said or
[44:00] the message said, "So the infinite
[44:04] God going to choose for his army the
[44:08] best." You know, if if if you have
[44:11] enemies of thousands of thousands of
[44:14] demons, God will give you the best
[44:16] weapon. God will give you the best uh uh
[44:21] garrison or how do you call that? Bomb.
[44:27] God will give you the best weapon to to
[44:29] to combat the enemy. Amen. Now, that
[44:33] best
[44:34] weapon never changed from the very
[44:37] beginning. It was the word of God.
[44:41] Amen. Because the Bible said he is the
[44:44] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[44:48] Amen.
[44:49] Amen. The prophet said yes. Oh. Uh, the
[44:54] best equipment that that it could ever
[44:57] use and ever could use and would never
[45:01] have to be changed and he has never
[45:05] changed it since.
[45:07] You don't improve it. It remains the
[45:11] same all the time. Amen. It is God's
[45:15] word
[45:16] that the the proverb said, "And the name
[45:19] of the Lord is a strong tower.
[45:23] See, the name of the Lord, the word of
[45:26] the Lord is a strong tower and the
[45:29] righteous run into it.
[45:32] Now, if you need help, run to God.
[45:36] Don't don't don't conf figureure it out.
[45:38] Don't don't figure it out. Don't Don't
[45:42] go to Google to figure it out. One of
[45:46] the
[45:47] brother, this is his testimony. He had a
[45:51] belly ache for a week. You know what he
[45:54] did? He googled the s
[45:57] symptoms and he found out from Google
[46:00] that he has a cancer colon
[46:05] cancer. The brother was
[46:08] depressed for months. He was depressed
[46:11] because of that symptoms that he googled
[46:14] it. Don't Google. Amen. Don't go to chat
[46:18] GPT. I can use I I was amazed when when
[46:23] the brother showed me this chat
[46:26] GPT. I can preach from chat
[46:29] GPT. Maybe people will stand up and say
[46:32] amen because of chat GPT. But always
[46:37] remember it is artificial. That's right.
[46:41] It's not real. It's still artificial.
[46:45] That's like the prophet said the plant
[46:47] that you baby because it's there's no
[46:50] seed,
[46:51] it don't grow, you need to baby the
[47:00] plant.
[47:02] The Satan demons are united in purpose
[47:07] to destroy the bride. But the Bible
[47:09] said, "So at that
[47:12] day ye shall know that I am in my
[47:16] father and ye in me and I in you."
[47:22] Hallelujah. At that
[47:24] day, this day today is the day. That's
[47:28] right. That day is today that God and
[47:32] you become one.
[47:34] I cannot fight it by myself. I will run
[47:38] away. But I thank the Lord that he never
[47:42] leave me nor forsake me until the end of
[47:44] the world. Thank you, Lord. Now God is
[47:47] our strong tower. Now God is our refuge
[47:50] and strength, a very present help in
[47:53] time of troubles.
[47:56] If you put that in your in your cell
[47:59] phone and read it every day, the Lord is
[48:02] my tower. The Lord is my shield. The
[48:05] Lord is my sword.
[48:08] You will be an invincible army.
[48:13] Amen. I was reading this and I was
[48:17] thinking I read this many times but
[48:21] maybe I can share it a little bit to
[48:23] you. In Matthew
[48:27] 21-9, this
[48:34] worker, the 11th hour
[48:39] worker, God
[48:45] uh chapter 20 verse one, for the kingdom
[48:49] of heaven is likened unto man that is an
[48:53] householder.
[48:54] which went out early in the morning to
[48:58] hire laborers unto his vineyard.
[49:01] Remember the the work in the Middle East
[49:04] before is 6 to 6, 6:00 in the morning,
[49:07] it will end at 6:00 at night. So from
[49:10] from sunset to dawn or sunrise to to
[49:15] sunset and and when he had
[49:20] agreed with the laborers for a penny a
[49:23] day, he sent them into the vineyard. So
[49:27] this man, the worker, started at six
[49:29] o'clock and and he went out uh about the
[49:33] third hour, 9:00, and he saw others
[49:37] standing uh idle in the uh
[49:41] marketplace, and said unto them, go ye
[49:44] also into the vineyard, and whatsoever
[49:47] is right, I will give you. And they went
[49:50] their way. Again he went out about
[49:55] 6th and the 9th hour
[49:58] 12:00 and
[50:00] 3:00 and did
[50:02] likewise. And about 11th
[50:05] hour 5 in the afternoon he went out and
[50:10] found others standing idle and said unto
[50:13] them, why stand ye there all the day
[50:17] idle? So they say unto him, idol means
[50:21] lazy. Don't be lazy. You have God
[50:25] commissioned you. God commissioned us to
[50:28] tell this word. What idol? Why lazy?
[50:35] And now because no man hath hired us, he
[50:39] had unto them, "Go ye also into the
[50:42] vineyard, and whatsoever is right, that
[50:45] shall ye receive." Eight. So when
[50:49] evening was come, the Lord of the
[50:52] vineyard said unto his steward, Call
[50:55] deliverers, and give them their hire,
[50:58] beginning from the last unto the
[51:02] first. And when they
[51:04] came that were hired about the 11th
[51:08] hour, they received every man a
[51:12] penny. You know, think about Paul. He
[51:16] started this seven church s ages. He was
[51:19] the first one uh first messenger in the
[51:22] epistas. And then you see Columba,
[51:26] Martin, Luther and
[51:29] Wesley and in our day the shortest age,
[51:33] brother Barley, the shortest age.
[51:37] Then we we receive the same thing
[51:40] actually better than them
[51:44] because the prophet said, "Oh, I love
[51:47] this this quote." The prophet said,
[51:49] "This is the grandest of all ages."
[51:53] Amen.
[51:55] Not in the in the time of Paul, not in
[51:59] the time of Wesley, but this day.
[52:03] this day that God and man united.
[52:09] The prophet said, "Oh, it's this is the
[52:13] loudysian age is the grandest of all the
[52:17] church ages because it's the ending of
[52:20] time and the blending of eternity."
[52:24] And then it's the
[52:27] greatest
[52:28] sinful my sinful age. It's more sin in
[52:34] this age than there ever been. Amen. And
[52:38] the power of Satan is many times harder
[52:42] to fight against than it was any age.
[52:49] Why you're standing? Why you have time?
[52:52] Uh brother Steven said
[52:54] 30% of your brain are working right now.
[52:57] Why you spend time to come here to
[52:59] church? because she love God.
[53:04] I was talking brother Barley about this
[53:06] about the brother one time the the
[53:10] streaming uh the believers that stream
[53:12] this is not uh this is from the brother.
[53:18] He said he said the the the the
[53:22] streaming is like he he figure it out.
[53:26] He said the streaming is
[53:28] like a cooking
[53:30] show. You see
[53:33] it, you you you see the ingredients and
[53:37] everything, but you cannot smell it and
[53:40] you cannot eat it.
[53:44] But in front of the people, you can
[53:47] taste it, you can smell it, and you can
[53:50] see me, brother David. Hallelujah.
[53:55] My
[54:04] brother, the prophet said, "Oh, this is
[54:06] a very good uh
[54:10] message." He said, "Christ in the true
[54:14] church is the continuation of the book
[54:17] of Acts." Amen. But the book of
[54:21] revelation shows how that the antichrist
[54:25] spirit would come. The grandest the
[54:30] whole power of demon will
[54:34] come into the
[54:37] church form of
[54:40] godliness. the church and defile it,
[54:44] making it
[54:46] lukewarm, formal, and powerless.
[54:51] It exposes Satan,
[54:54] revealing his
[54:56] works, attempted destruction of God's
[54:59] people, and the discrediting of God's
[55:03] word, right down to the time he is cast
[55:08] into the lake of fire. He fights that he
[55:12] cannot stand it. He knows that if the
[55:16] people get that the the the uh the if
[55:20] the
[55:22] people get the true revelation of a true
[55:26] church and what she is, she stands for
[55:33] and she can do the greater works. See
[55:36] the power that's in the church. Amen.
[55:39] But she needs to recognize these two
[55:41] spirits.
[55:44] Now, brother, I can tell you you're my
[55:47] brother, but I can discern you in two
[55:50] minutes. So, better say something. Say
[55:53] something
[55:54] good. The prophet said, "You can discern
[55:57] a person if he has the Holy Ghost or
[56:00] not."
[56:03] In two minutes.
[56:05] Amen.
[56:08] She will be an invincible army. And they
[56:12] get a true revelation of the true spirit
[56:16] within the framework of the of the
[56:18] Christian church and by God's spirit
[56:21] discern and withstand the antichrist
[56:24] spirit. Satan will be powerless before
[56:26] her. Amen.
[56:28] He will be as uh uh definitely uh
[56:33] thwarted today as when Christ withtood
[56:37] his every effort to gain power over him
[56:41] in the desert. Amen. Yes, Satan hates
[56:45] revelation, but we love it. with true
[56:49] revelation in in our lives. The gates of
[56:53] hell cannot prevail against us but we
[56:57] will prevail over them. Hallelujah. See
[57:00] who said it. Who said it? Remember it
[57:04] was the Holy Ghost wrote draw the seven
[57:07] church ages. This is not Lee Whale's
[57:11] book.
[57:13] Amen. What is the true spirit?
[57:17] So the prophet guided us to see our
[57:22] position. What is this truth? Uh truth
[57:25] uh uh false
[57:27] spirits. In John 4
[57:31] 1-4, John said, "Beloved, believe not
[57:36] every spirit,
[57:38] but try the spirits whether they are of
[57:42] God."
[57:43] See, they they they believe they're a
[57:45] message believers, but there's no power.
[57:48] Amen. I hate powerless Christian.
[57:55] Hereby know that the spirit of
[57:58] God, every spirit that confesseth that
[58:02] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not
[58:06] of God. And every spirit that confesseth
[58:10] not that Jesus Christ is come in the
[58:13] flesh is not of
[58:16] God. Did I read right? No. Okay, I will
[58:21] read it again. I think something wrong.
[58:24] Hereby know ye the spirit of God. Every
[58:28] spirit that confessth that Jesus Christ
[58:31] Yes. Good is come in the flesh is of
[58:36] God.
[58:39] See, there's something in me that it was
[58:40] wrong.
[58:44] Thank the Lord. Thank you, Lord. And
[58:46] every spirit that confesseth not that
[58:50] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not
[58:53] of God. Right. And this is that spirit
[58:57] of antichrist that will come to
[59:04] church. My
[59:06] brother, ye are of God little children
[59:10] and you have overcome
[59:12] them because greater is he that is in
[59:16] you. That's this is the connected of
[59:20] connection of that two.
[59:23] Greater is he that is in you than he
[59:25] that is in the world. Amen. Amen. See
[59:28] that antichrist spirit.
[59:31] They will come. They will cry. They are
[59:35] emotional. This is the the brother told
[59:37] me when I was in Cancun. He said,
[59:41] "Brother, I will not going to mention
[59:43] the name of the church." He said,
[59:46] "Brother, I am
[59:49] confused." I said, "Why?" He said,
[59:52] "Brother, our church want us, energize
[59:56] us to go back to
[59:58] Pentecost." And and because of that,
[1:00:01] brother, I see
[1:00:03] sisters, brothers running at the aisle,
[1:00:07] running, dancing in the
[1:00:10] spirit. But I am confused. I said,
[1:00:13] "Why?" Because she said, "That sister
[1:00:16] that was running came to me and want to
[1:00:19] sleep with me.
[1:00:22] Is that the spirit of God? It's emotion.
[1:00:27] Be careful of your emotion. It must be
[1:00:30] tied with the word. I preach. I I love
[1:00:34] emotion, brother. I cried sometimes. I
[1:00:38] laughed sometimes. But I want to pattern
[1:00:41] myself to the word.
[1:00:46] Jude, another spirit. Jude 1 3-4 to 4
[1:00:51] and
[1:00:52] 12. It said here,
[1:00:55] "Beloved, when I gave all diligence to
[1:00:58] write unto you of the common salvation,
[1:01:03] it was needful for me to write unto you,
[1:01:06] and to exhort you, that ye should
[1:01:09] earnestly content for the faith, for the
[1:01:14] faith which was once delivered unto the
[1:01:18] saints.
[1:01:20] For there are certain men cripped in
[1:01:25] awares who were
[1:01:28] before of old ordained to this
[1:01:32] condemnation. Ungodly
[1:01:34] men turning the grace of our God into
[1:01:39] laxiviousness and denying the only Lord
[1:01:42] God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:01:46] 12 There are spots in your feast of
[1:01:52] charity. When they feast with you,
[1:01:55] feeding themselves without fear, clouds,
[1:02:00] they are without water.
[1:02:04] carrier carried about of winds freeze
[1:02:09] whose fruits
[1:02:10] wathered weatherth without fruit twice
[1:02:16] dead plucked up by the
[1:02:19] roots raging waves of the sea foaming
[1:02:23] out their own shame wondering stars they
[1:02:27] are stars also brother but their lights
[1:02:30] are blinking
[1:02:35] Wave will pull them from pillar to post,
[1:02:39] from church to church, wandering stars,
[1:02:46] clouds without water, believer without
[1:02:49] power,
[1:02:50] but they will come and they will start
[1:02:55] hissing the voice of the serpent.
[1:02:58] Did you see the brother? He's weird.
[1:03:02] He's English. He's this. Did you see
[1:03:05] what he said? I think this church is
[1:03:08] false. Let's go to another church.
[1:03:11] See, they will come. They will creep
[1:03:13] inside the church and they will deliver
[1:03:17] a he of Satan. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:03:22] Powerless
[1:03:24] church. My but the prophet said or the
[1:03:27] Bible said for all or for our gospel
[1:03:32] came not into the uh uh into you in word
[1:03:35] only.
[1:03:38] See this is this is a package deal my
[1:03:41] brothers and sisters a package deal. You
[1:03:45] know the deal is you have the word, you
[1:03:49] have the power and the Bible said the
[1:03:53] sign, these signs will follow you. Amen.
[1:03:58] And not only that, he said there are
[1:04:00] three signs that will follow. The signs
[1:04:03] and wonders will follow you. Second, he
[1:04:07] said, David said in in Psalms 23, he
[1:04:11] said, "Goodness
[1:04:14] and mercy, hallelujah, shall follow me
[1:04:18] all the days of my life." That's right.
[1:04:20] See, brothers, I'm walking alone, but
[1:04:24] signs and wonders following me, and
[1:04:27] goodness and mercy shall follow you all
[1:04:30] the days of your life. Thank you Jesus.
[1:04:33] The word even our in our mouth.
[1:04:40] Amen.
[1:04:43] Now once you discern the two
[1:04:46] spirits here in the
[1:04:49] church now you will be an invincible
[1:04:52] army.
[1:04:58] I was thinking of this. You know what?
[1:05:01] What is our title again? Save the best
[1:05:04] for last. This is the blending of time
[1:05:08] or blending. What is that
[1:05:11] again? And and
[1:05:13] uh uh
[1:05:15] entering where's my I will illustrate
[1:05:21] something. I love to
[1:05:24] illustrate. Let's go to John chapter
[1:05:30] five. First John or no, Revelation 5.
[1:05:36] Sorry. I hope 30 minutes
[1:05:39] more. I can still get
[1:05:42] it. So the Bible said, I want you to see
[1:05:46] your position.
[1:05:53] This is
[1:05:56] good. Okay, I want you, brother Bryant,
[1:06:00] to sit here.
[1:06:07] Amen.
[1:06:10] So, save the best for last. I want to
[1:06:14] see you, your position, who you are,
[1:06:18] where you came from, and where you
[1:06:21] going. We came from from from from
[1:06:27] uh what do you call that? We we I didn't
[1:06:29] came from the Philippines, brother. My
[1:06:31] very beginning is not in the
[1:06:32] Philippines.
[1:06:34] So in in Revelation chapter
[1:06:38] 119, God told
[1:06:42] John, John, everything that you
[1:06:45] see, everything the from the very
[1:06:48] beginning to the future, I want you to
[1:06:51] write everything because it's it is a
[1:06:55] very important to the
[1:06:58] church. Okay. Yes, Lord. I'm ready. I'm
[1:07:02] ready to write. So when God showed the
[1:07:06] scorpion to John, he wrote he wrote a
[1:07:11] scorpion.
[1:07:15] Scorpion. Um, what else, Lord? Ox.
[1:07:19] Ox.
[1:07:21] Man, lots of animals.
[1:07:25] Eagle. My dragon. Dragon.
[1:07:32] But
[1:07:33] then the word is getting deeper and
[1:07:36] deeper, deeper and deeper. And God
[1:07:40] showed it to him. He said, "I want you
[1:07:43] to write um in in Revelation chapter 13
[1:07:48] 13." What is Revelation
[1:07:54] 13:13? This one is good. So I need to
[1:07:57] write this but in symbol form.
[1:08:02] So he wrote Revelation
[1:08:04] 1313 and this
[1:08:07] powerful
[1:08:10] image can can bring fire from heaven
[1:08:15] and and destroy the earth.
[1:08:18] So he wrote the fire and the the the I
[1:08:21] think what kind of skyab or what? So but
[1:08:24] then in our
[1:08:27] days, America is the number one producer
[1:08:31] of
[1:08:33] drones. Now the drone can go drop a bomb
[1:08:39] to somewhere in Asia, Africa or
[1:08:44] Russia. They are the number one
[1:08:46] producers of drones. They are little. So
[1:08:51] the
[1:08:52] Americans one day he dropped the bomb to
[1:08:56] Sulmani the general of of uh what do you
[1:09:00] call that Iran and they found where I we
[1:09:03] didn't see anything from the from the
[1:09:05] from the from the sky or from the
[1:09:09] radar but she can drop a fire from
[1:09:13] heaven and then uh he saw uh in
[1:09:17] revelation 11 there was a two olive
[1:09:21] trees that was cut off. But then the
[1:09:25] whole nation
[1:09:26] saw what they did to the to the you know
[1:09:30] to the to the uh two
[1:09:33] prophets and then according to John he
[1:09:36] saw CNN and Fox News. So CNN, Fox News
[1:09:45] who who will say all nations will see
[1:09:50] the two prophets,
[1:09:53] right? Because there was a there's a Fox
[1:09:57] News and CNN and there's a Facebook live
[1:10:00] and Instagram live and all nations and
[1:10:03] tongues will see that news.
[1:10:08] My, it's getting deeper and deeper. But
[1:10:11] then here was in in John or in
[1:10:13] Revelation chapter
[1:10:15] 5. There was a
[1:10:18] book in the hand of the original owner.
[1:10:21] Yes, sir.
[1:10:23] But this book, oh, I love the the
[1:10:26] illustration of brother Chad, brother.
[1:10:29] That book, I cannot even look to that
[1:10:34] book. I cannot even see. I I don't want
[1:10:37] to see it. It's precious. It's
[1:10:42] sacred. Right. And then there was uh
[1:10:46] Revelation chapter 5. Uh can you uh pull
[1:10:48] that so that I can illustrate? My Bible
[1:10:51] right now is in the hand of the original
[1:10:54] owner.
[1:10:58] And I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:11:01] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:11:05] and on that backside sealed with seven
[1:11:09] seals. So it's continue
[1:11:11] brother. So now it's sealed. No one can
[1:11:16] open it. And I saw a strong angel
[1:11:19] proclaiming with a loud voice, who is
[1:11:21] worthy to open that book and to loose
[1:11:23] the seals
[1:11:25] thereof? No one. No man in heaven, nor
[1:11:29] in earth, neither in in the in the earth
[1:11:32] was able to open the book, neither to
[1:11:34] look
[1:11:36] thereon. Sacred. And I weep much because
[1:11:40] no man was found worthy to open and to
[1:11:44] read the book, neither to look thereon.
[1:11:48] No one is worthy to open, to read, or to
[1:11:52] look. But then wait, there was a voice.
[1:11:56] And one of the elders said unto
[1:11:59] me, "We not
[1:12:01] behold lion of the tribe of Judah, the
[1:12:05] root of David had prevailed to open the
[1:12:08] book and to loose the seven seals
[1:12:10] thereof." So now John know that he wrote
[1:12:14] a lion. He said, "Yes, I I I put lion
[1:12:18] here."
[1:12:20] But then and behold in the midst of the
[1:12:23] throne and the the four beasts in the
[1:12:26] midst of the elders stood a lamb. He
[1:12:28] said it can't be. I know the lamb and
[1:12:30] the lion. Lamb is different from the
[1:12:33] lion. Lamb is a
[1:12:35] meek, worthless animal that if he's
[1:12:38] lost, he cannot go back. But the lion is
[1:12:41] the king of the jungle. But he he can't
[1:12:45] be right. having seven horns and seven
[1:12:50] eyes, which the seventh spirit of God
[1:12:52] sent for forth into the
[1:12:56] earth. And he came and took that book
[1:13:00] out of the right hand of him that sat
[1:13:03] upon the throne. So this this lamb that
[1:13:08] was
[1:13:10] slain when when he was lain before the
[1:13:13] foundation of the world. What is the
[1:13:16] book? It's the lamp's book of life. The
[1:13:20] title did the book of the redemption.
[1:13:25] You can say a lots of things to this
[1:13:27] book. But why John was crying? Brother
[1:13:31] uh Bryant, why he was crying? Because
[1:13:34] the prophet said if he won't if he will
[1:13:38] not see his name in the book maybe he
[1:13:42] will
[1:13:43] lost or maybe he will like a a vapor
[1:13:47] that will
[1:13:48] vanish. So he it's very important to
[1:13:51] John to see his name in the book. Amen.
[1:13:54] Now when the lamb you know in the the
[1:13:58] pattern of the heaven Moses built the
[1:14:02] temple and to go to the holy of
[1:14:06] holies you cannot enter without a blood.
[1:14:10] That's why the bloody lamb
[1:14:12] came entered and opened the book and
[1:14:17] when he found his name he was rejoicing
[1:14:21] he was singing. Amen. Now my question
[1:14:26] is before I come
[1:14:29] here before
[1:14:31] Philippines where is I where am I?
[1:14:37] Where are we?
[1:14:40] We came from the throne of God.
[1:14:44] Our names is in the throne of God.
[1:14:47] That's why the Bible said if we overcome
[1:14:50] we God will grant us to sit in his
[1:14:54] throne because from the very beginning
[1:14:56] we came from the throne.
[1:14:59] So now if Satan will come to you and
[1:15:02] tell you the lies that you're not saved,
[1:15:04] you tell him that I came from the throne
[1:15:08] because John was the type of Jesus
[1:15:10] Christ. Amen, brother Bryant. Okay.
[1:15:14] Thank you so much. That's it. Okay.
[1:15:23] It's
[1:15:28] okay. It's hot in here.
[1:15:31] Okay.
[1:15:35] So, save the best for last. So, now why
[1:15:39] we're the best? Because God opened this
[1:15:42] to us. Amen. God did not open this to
[1:15:46] Luther. Luther was a messenger but he
[1:15:49] was smoking. He was
[1:15:52] cursing. But when the perfect is
[1:15:56] come, it will come to it people. Amen.
[1:16:01] It will come to the spotless bride of
[1:16:03] Jesus Christ.
[1:16:07] So now I'm not done with Revelation. I
[1:16:10] like this.
[1:16:12] So remember the two spirits in the
[1:16:16] church. Revelation chapter 6 that was
[1:16:20] the the four horse
[1:16:24] riders. Now the white horse when when
[1:16:28] the white horse came they came with
[1:16:33] Bible. I will bless you my
[1:16:36] son. Okay. Give me your money.
[1:16:42] So they came with the word of God and
[1:16:46] that was the biggest
[1:16:49] deception. But then I said the the Bible
[1:16:52] said and
[1:16:54] God he's always the winner.
[1:16:59] That's why I was asking you if we can
[1:17:02] sing that oldtime undisputed undefeated
[1:17:06] champion of all.
[1:17:09] Now
[1:17:10] brothers, but then God raised another uh
[1:17:16] huh uh something that lion to combat
[1:17:19] that evil spirit that cripped inside a
[1:17:23] church. Now the the boldness of the lion
[1:17:28] he will fight brother he wants to be the
[1:17:30] king.
[1:17:32] No one can stand before him. That's why
[1:17:35] the the when Paul was preaching, he was
[1:17:37] preaching in in Galatians 1:8. If any
[1:17:41] even an angel will come down and preach
[1:17:45] another gospel,
[1:17:47] that angel must be accured because the
[1:17:51] word that we preach, this word come from
[1:17:53] the throne.
[1:17:58] Then the
[1:18:00] persecution. But then God combated that
[1:18:04] with an
[1:18:05] ox
[1:18:07] anointing. Brother, the the the
[1:18:09] Christians, 68 million
[1:18:12] Christians, they don't you don't even
[1:18:14] run after them. They will come to you
[1:18:19] because they were anointed to die for
[1:18:22] Christ.
[1:18:25] It will not going to happen to us,
[1:18:26] brothers and
[1:18:27] sisters. But God wants your
[1:18:30] time. God wants your your your
[1:18:35] obligation. What is our obligation to
[1:18:37] our
[1:18:39] family?
[1:18:41] Stop. Look and
[1:18:44] listen. Stop. Think about the
[1:18:47] word. Look and listen to the word.
[1:18:53] But
[1:18:54] then Satan, as I said while ago,
[1:18:58] hundreds and millions of demons, God uni
[1:19:02] uh Satan united his troops to destroy
[1:19:06] this message. But God raised an
[1:19:10] anointing eagle
[1:19:12] that the eagle can fly. The eagle can
[1:19:16] see, the eagle can save his co- eagle or
[1:19:20] not co-eagle. What do you call that?
[1:19:22] Another eagles that needs help. They
[1:19:26] will come and fly and drop a meat.
[1:19:29] Brother, you're not a baby. I will send
[1:19:32] you meat. Eagle don't drink milk. That's
[1:19:36] right. Eagle loves chicken.
[1:19:43] That's why most of the young people love
[1:19:48] canes. They love chicken
[1:19:54] brothers. What is that? The
[1:20:02] canes. See the anointing? The pale
[1:20:05] horse. the the black the white horse,
[1:20:07] the black horse, and the red horse.
[1:20:09] Famine, death. But God raised an eagle
[1:20:14] anointing to combat Satan. And Satan
[1:20:18] cannot be, you know, he cannot stand
[1:20:21] with
[1:20:23] eagles. His tricks are exposed.
[1:20:28] If the two
[1:20:31] spirits, if we see and discern the two
[1:20:34] spirits in the church, you will be an
[1:20:37] invincible army.
[1:20:40] Amen.
[1:20:43] I ask for a
[1:20:46] glass. Brother Steven gave me a flower
[1:20:52] vase. So I will illustrate this to you.
[1:20:55] Many preachers, brother Barley, brother
[1:20:57] Ron, many preachers preach this, but I
[1:21:01] want to show it to you to see what kind
[1:21:05] of power do you have. You know what kind
[1:21:08] is it? A it is a a
[1:21:11] a power that uh you know it it
[1:21:17] expired. So you know the prophet
[1:21:20] said God gave us that that that God
[1:21:26] wants to church the
[1:21:30] threefold purpose of God
[1:21:37] right where's the chair oh okay this is
[1:21:40] the threefold purpose of God this is God
[1:21:45] no um illustration
[1:21:49] I will put this as an
[1:21:51] illustration.
[1:21:53] God as a powerful God created heaven and
[1:21:57] earth to show
[1:22:01] uh uh he before the foundation of the
[1:22:03] world he had he have a bride in uh in
[1:22:06] his mind that he wants to manifest
[1:22:08] himself. He don't want to sit in the
[1:22:11] throne and and dictate you what to do or
[1:22:14] I will put a a
[1:22:16] a what do you call that on and up on
[1:22:20] your
[1:22:21] back that is a switch that if he's sad
[1:22:25] he will turn it on and you will sing
[1:22:28] brother
[1:22:29] David no he wants you
[1:22:33] God gave us a free moral agency to
[1:22:37] choose the right that's why God gave us
[1:22:40] a h a uh nine fruits of the
[1:22:46] spirits. It will manifest. It will come
[1:22:48] out from us. If you are the seed of God,
[1:22:51] it will it will bear fruit.
[1:22:56] The powerful
[1:22:57] God, the
[1:22:59] omnipotent, the
[1:23:02] omniscient, the
[1:23:04] Jehovah, he poured out. I will hold this
[1:23:07] flower vase. He poured out all of his
[1:23:10] power
[1:23:13] to Jesus Christ.
[1:23:19] All of his power. All. If I say all.
[1:23:23] All. No
[1:23:27] drops. And uh and Jesus Christ poured
[1:23:32] out his
[1:23:34] power into his church. Amen. into his
[1:23:42] bride. It's
[1:23:44] all I will not going to waste the power.
[1:24:01] I think the flower vase has a soap,
[1:24:02] brother.
[1:24:10] So where where is the power now? Where
[1:24:14] is the power now? All that God washed,
[1:24:18] he poured out. Poured it into Jesus
[1:24:21] Christ. And all the power of Jesus
[1:24:24] Christ, he poured it into his bride.
[1:24:27] Hallelujah.
[1:24:30] Where is the power now?
[1:24:32] It's in the bride.
[1:24:36] Glory.
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:39] Brother Ted Busedley one time told me he
[1:24:42] said when he was an evangelist of
[1:24:44] brother Perry Green, he said he always
[1:24:47] say, "Can you say amen? Can you say
[1:24:50] amen?" And brother Perry Green was
[1:24:53] waiting after the church was waiting of
[1:24:55] him outside and said, "Brother Ted, how
[1:24:58] many times you said can you say amen?
[1:25:02] I said, "I I don't know." He said, "I
[1:25:04] counted it. It's six 60 times." So he
[1:25:09] said, "If you direct that message to the
[1:25:11] people, that was a good message." But
[1:25:15] you were like using Can you say amen?
[1:25:17] You wasted a precious
[1:25:20] time. So that's why I don't really say
[1:25:24] amen.
[1:25:27] Sometimes I say Gloria
[1:25:35] DS. It's almost finished. I will close
[1:25:39] this. You know the prophet
[1:25:42] said the finger of
[1:25:44] God, the finger of
[1:25:47] God can cast out Satan.
[1:25:51] And he said when
[1:25:53] he used his finger, it was 10 flags in
[1:25:58] Egypt, Egypt was
[1:26:01] destroyed because of the finger of God.
[1:26:03] Amen. But then when
[1:26:06] God was looking for his
[1:26:09] son, he said never use his
[1:26:13] finger. Instead, he looked for his lost
[1:26:17] sheep. And what did he do brothers and
[1:26:21] sisters? He carried the ship. And where
[1:26:25] what what part of the body of the person
[1:26:27] is the strongest?
[1:26:30] It's the shoulder and the legs. When he
[1:26:34] carried the sheep, the lost sheep, he
[1:26:38] put it in his legs and carried in his
[1:26:41] shoulder. See, you are precious in the
[1:26:44] sight of God. My brothers and sisters,
[1:26:47] don't you ever think that you're lost.
[1:26:51] Don't you ever think that you are
[1:26:53] defeated.
[1:26:55] You are the most powerful, precious
[1:26:58] bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. He
[1:27:01] used his shoulder to carry you. Not his
[1:27:04] finger.
[1:27:08] Think about it.
[1:27:10] Think about it.
[1:27:14] He used his
[1:27:22] shoulder. He was an
[1:27:25] engineer. You know when Oh, I jumped.
[1:27:28] Sorry. When when when
[1:27:32] this
[1:27:37] literate what I can say
[1:27:40] more
[1:27:44] crazy no name in the society
[1:27:50] rejected destroyed by his family
[1:27:53] divorced with his
[1:27:55] wife the the children even don't want
[1:28:00] the
[1:28:02] children his
[1:28:04] name because they called him the crazy
[1:28:07] man from
[1:28:08] Gdara. But when he cried out unto
[1:28:13] God, God left his throne to come down
[1:28:18] and rescued him.
[1:28:21] What did he do? He put him in his
[1:28:23] shoulder.
[1:28:24] He was the lost sheep.
[1:28:28] See my precious brothers, sisters, our
[1:28:31] battle is not by flesh and blood. Our
[1:28:34] battle is a neurotic age. Our mind
[1:28:38] battle
[1:28:40] that
[1:28:42] people are killing
[1:28:45] themselves, even message
[1:28:48] believers because you know
[1:28:51] why? They don't get
[1:28:53] fed. They're confused.
[1:28:56] But I thank God for the five-fold
[1:28:58] ministry. Amen. That we come and deliver
[1:29:02] the message come from the Lord.
[1:29:05] Thank you, Lord. That we tell you that
[1:29:08] you are precious in his
[1:29:10] sight. That you are fearfully,
[1:29:13] wonderfully made of God.
[1:29:16] Don't waste your time. Come serve him
[1:29:20] while there's time. You see the the the
[1:29:23] the signs already.
[1:29:26] You see that the the the the uh priest
[1:29:31] or the pope comes from America 1954
[1:29:34] brother
[1:29:37] Ron but I believe that this message is a
[1:29:42] powerful message come from the throne.
[1:29:44] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:48] Um
[1:29:51] 55 the prophet
[1:29:57] said what is your position now? You know
[1:30:01] we read in the book of
[1:30:03] revelation. But here is in the book of
[1:30:06] revelation
[1:30:08] 20110 the position of Satan and and the
[1:30:12] bride. Why God saved
[1:30:15] her for the
[1:30:17] best for last? Why God saved
[1:30:21] her? Choose
[1:30:23] her. You know, if if you go to the Navy
[1:30:26] Seals, Brother Amos was talking about
[1:30:29] the seals last time. If you go to this
[1:30:32] uh they call this uh uh um you go to San
[1:30:35] Diego and uh you will, you know, the the
[1:30:39] generals will test you. The master
[1:30:42] sergeant was will test you how far can
[1:30:44] you
[1:30:45] go and hundreds sometimes after a week
[1:30:49] it reduced to 50 after two weeks it
[1:30:53] reduced to
[1:30:54] 13 after a few weeks it reduced to
[1:30:59] three. The Bible said or the song said
[1:31:04] fear not little flock. It's not a big
[1:31:07] flock. It's a little flock.
[1:31:11] that you can even see little little
[1:31:16] there are little group of people. But
[1:31:19] then the end of Satan and the end of the
[1:31:23] bride, it said here in Revelation
[1:31:25] chapter
[1:31:26] 20110, the end of Satan and the devil
[1:31:30] that deceived them was cast into the
[1:31:34] lake of fire and
[1:31:36] brimstone where the beast and the false
[1:31:40] prophets, see the two spirits are there,
[1:31:43] the false prophets are and shall be
[1:31:47] tormented day and night forever and
[1:31:51] ever.
[1:31:53] That's the end of Satan.
[1:31:56] Now, what is the end of the
[1:31:58] bride? The end of the bride is
[1:32:00] Revelation 19:7 to8. Let us be glad and
[1:32:04] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:32:08] marriage of the Lamb is come, and his
[1:32:11] wife hath made herself ready. Amen.
[1:32:14] And to hear was granted unto her was
[1:32:19] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:32:22] fine linen, clean and white, for the
[1:32:25] fine linen is the righteousness of the
[1:32:29] saints. Amen.
[1:32:32] Now, Revelation
[1:32:34] 21:2, "And I, John, saw the holy
[1:32:38] city, New Jerusalem, coming down from
[1:32:42] God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
[1:32:47] adorned for her husband." See your end.
[1:32:52] It's a It's a marriage
[1:32:55] suffer. Amen.
[1:32:58] No, not wedding
[1:33:01] supper. See the marriage is here. The
[1:33:05] marriage, the ministers and are
[1:33:07] introducing you. The prophet are
[1:33:10] introducing you to
[1:33:15] him. That is the end of
[1:33:18] you. Now to the coward and to the
[1:33:23] fearful, you will not going to see them
[1:33:25] here.
[1:33:27] I'm expecting still that there's some of
[1:33:31] us will going to run
[1:33:34] away but I pray that all of us
[1:33:39] here will still be there
[1:33:43] or you will be there because you know
[1:33:46] why because God said I save you for the
[1:33:51] last. You are perfect in my sight. You
[1:33:55] are spotless in my sight.
[1:33:58] Let's stand up.
[1:34:14] as uh the musician
[1:34:23] comes. Can we sing
[1:34:26] that? Und undisputed. We'll try. Can Can
[1:34:31] we do
[1:34:32] that, Sister Anne? Can
[1:34:35] we we'll do the chorus
[1:34:38] then?
[1:34:43] Chorus. I was listening to a looking for
[1:34:46] a song for
[1:34:49] this
[1:34:50] and I didn't even warn the believers or
[1:34:53] the
[1:34:54] musicians, but we'll do the chorus.
[1:34:59] Help me brother.
[1:35:02] Ladies and
[1:35:05] gentlemen, may I have your attention?
[1:35:11] I want to introduce to
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:18] you in this corner.
[1:35:23] The good and the
[1:35:26] right stands a champion bro.
[1:35:35] His high exceeds the heavens.
[1:35:39] His weight outweigh the world.
[1:35:43] His reach out reaches
[1:35:46] everyone. His angels ever more.
[1:35:52] He is higher than the highest.
[1:35:57] He's gater than the grace.
[1:36:01] No one could ever take his crown away.
[1:36:09] You're mightier than mightiest.
[1:36:13] He raised from
[1:36:18] above. The all time
[1:36:23] undisputed
[1:36:25] undefeated
[1:36:27] champion of love.
[1:36:32] He left his
[1:36:34] hometown to enter this
[1:36:38] arena to raise his hands in
[1:36:42] victory for
[1:36:46] us. An angry crowd cried,
[1:36:50] "Crucify this king who bore their
[1:36:53] crown."
[1:36:55] And they gladly watch the champion go
[1:37:00] down.
[1:37:02] That was Satan. But I will never count
[1:37:06] him out. For I'm a witness
[1:37:10] of the day he arose to retain his title
[1:37:16] champion of love.
[1:37:20] He is higher than the highest.
[1:37:25] Gater than the
[1:37:28] great. No one will ever take his crown
[1:37:35] away. He's more mighty than the
[1:37:40] mightiest. He reigns from above.
[1:37:46] He's the
[1:37:48] alltime
[1:37:50] undisputed
[1:37:52] undefeated
[1:37:54] champion of love.
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:38:00] Father, Satan
[1:38:02] thought that you're dead. You were
[1:38:06] crucified. You are eliminated.
[1:38:10] But he did not know. By your death, by
[1:38:15] your by the
[1:38:16] cross, you raised us up.
[1:38:20] And you came to us. The sinners became
[1:38:24] the saints.
[1:38:26] You became us. Thank you, Lord. And we
[1:38:30] became you.
[1:38:32] If Satan thought he will escape the
[1:38:37] cross, but you are undefeated,
[1:38:42] undisputed champion of all and in your
[1:38:47] side, the bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:50] Christ.
[1:38:53] Now we became undefeated, undisputed
[1:38:58] because of your blood that runs in our
[1:39:02] veins. We love you tonight, Father. May
[1:39:05] this little
[1:39:08] message can come to the hearts of the
[1:39:11] believers tonight and will grow and grow
[1:39:15] and grow. Yes. That we will come and we
[1:39:19] will
[1:39:20] offer praise to you, Father. We love
[1:39:23] you. We praise you. We worship you. We
[1:39:26] give you honor. Thank you so much for
[1:39:30] saving us in these last days that in
[1:39:34] this darkest age we are shining.
[1:39:38] Thank you, Father, in Jesus Christ's
[1:39:40] name. Amen. Amen. Bless you. Amen.
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:51] highest. He is greater than the
[1:39:55] great. No one can ever take his crown
[1:40:03] away. He's more mighty than the
[1:40:08] mightiest. He reigns from
[1:40:11] above.
[1:40:13] love. He's the

[1:40:20] undefeated champion of
[1:40:24] love. He is higher than the

[1:41:14] Glory.
[1:41:15] Hallelujah.
[1:41:17] I love him tonight. Don't you? God bless
[1:41:20] you. Brother Burley is here and I
[1:41:22] thought I'd just take a moment. We all
[1:41:25] know Brother Burley. Love him. And he
[1:41:27] and he came in
[1:41:29] late. And uh so I'd like him to just
[1:41:32] greet you. Why don't you just sit down
[1:41:33] for just a minute? We're going to close
[1:41:35] in a I'm going to have him close in a
[1:41:37] word of prayer, but have brother Burley
[1:41:40] come up here. Brother Burley, tell us
[1:41:43] how things are going. Good. God bless
[1:41:45] you, brother.
[1:41:47] Come on up here. God bless you. Bless
[1:41:50] you.
[1:41:52] It's good to be
[1:41:54] here. Amen. Kind of on a
[1:41:57] little getaway, vacation a little bit.
[1:42:01] Actually, I've been here since Monday,
[1:42:03] brother.
[1:42:05] And you didn't let me know. I sure
[1:42:09] did. Everything was playing.
[1:42:12] I come in
[1:42:14] late. My brother Robert knew. Yeah.
[1:42:17] Okay. Well, brother Robert McGary. He
[1:42:20] knew. I told him. I said, "Don't you
[1:42:23] tell better brother Ron I'm coming up
[1:42:25] here." I said, "I
[1:42:27] don't I'm going to Well, we I'm going up
[1:42:30] to Flag. Uh but I just wanted to get
[1:42:34] away for a moment and uh I enjoyed the
[1:42:37] word. Amen. Amen. Appreciate our brother
[1:42:41] pouring out his heart. It's just
[1:42:43] wonderful. Amen. You know, we find
[1:42:47] ourselves in the word of God. I like
[1:42:50] what brother Brandon said. You'll find
[1:42:52] yourself in the Bible. Find characters
[1:42:56] that when you're going through
[1:42:57] something. Amen. And however they come
[1:42:59] out, you can come out the same way.
[1:43:02] That's right. Thank you, Lord. And uh
[1:43:05] we've been through a lot lately, the
[1:43:07] last two months, and I found myself in
[1:43:10] the Bible. Amen. Amen. And uh I found
[1:43:14] myself in the book of Judges. Amen. Not
[1:43:18] the whole book of
[1:43:19] Judges. And I found myself when Samson
[1:43:23] in Judges 15, I believe it is. You
[1:43:26] remember when Samson beat the
[1:43:27] Philistines? Yeah. And uh he did it with
[1:43:30] a new jawbone. Amen. But after he beat
[1:43:33] him, he said, "Now I thirst." And he
[1:43:38] said, "Lord, I
[1:43:39] thirst." He said, "Now if you don't give
[1:43:41] me pretty much you don't give me
[1:43:43] something." He said, "He's uncircumcised
[1:43:45] going to come take advantage of me."
[1:43:48] What did God
[1:43:49] do? The very weapon he used, he gave him
[1:43:52] a drink from it.
[1:43:55] I found myself there. I said, "Lord, you
[1:43:58] know I'm thirsty, broken, sir. Heartavy,
[1:44:03] mentally stressed,
[1:44:05] been fighting." I said now, "Lord, I
[1:44:07] took your word.
[1:44:10] People being set free, people being
[1:44:12] delivered." I said, "No, about me."
[1:44:16] I said, "Now, Lord, I need something."
[1:44:19] So, what did he do? the very jawbone,
[1:44:22] the weapon that he used, he gave him a
[1:44:24] drink from it. Thank you, Lord. So, the
[1:44:26] very word I've been using to help
[1:44:29] people, deliver people, I said, "God, I
[1:44:31] gotta drink from it." Amen. And he gave
[1:44:34] me a drink tonight. Thank you, Lord. I
[1:44:36] appreciate the brother pouring out his
[1:44:38] heart. And so, I just slipped in and
[1:44:42] want to hear the word of God. And I
[1:44:44] enjoyed it. I'm so thankful. But Brandon
[1:44:48] said, he said, "There's no demon out of
[1:44:51] hell can defeat the purpose of God."
[1:44:55] That's right.
[1:44:56] That's so real to me. He said, "No demon
[1:44:59] out of hell can defeat the purpose of
[1:45:01] God." That's right. Then the Bible tells
[1:45:04] us, "All that love the Lord, we are
[1:45:07] called by, chosen by, but we're called
[1:45:10] for whose purpose?" His purpose. Amen.
[1:45:14] So if I love the Lord, all things works
[1:45:16] to good for together for the good for
[1:45:18] them that love him and are called for
[1:45:20] his purpose. Thank you, Lord. Praise the
[1:45:22] Lord. So we God's purpose. Amen. If I'm
[1:45:26] here for God's purpose, there's not a
[1:45:27] demon out of hell. That's right. Can
[1:45:29] interfere what God is going to do in my
[1:45:32] life and is doing in my life. So we so
[1:45:35] thankful and uh I just really enjoyed
[1:45:37] the word. Saved the best for last.
[1:45:40] That's right. Satan done emptied out of
[1:45:42] hell been emptied out. And God done
[1:45:44] emptied out everything for you and me.
[1:45:47] All you got to do is just take hold of
[1:45:49] it. Is that right? That's right. I was
[1:45:52] just listening to the brother in the
[1:45:54] church a book. He said, "When the truth
[1:45:56] when you get revelation," I love that
[1:45:58] quote. Come on. He said, "But true
[1:46:01] revelation not in your head." That's
[1:46:03] right. It's in your life. Amen. You
[1:46:07] become that invincible army. When God
[1:46:10] reveals something to you, there's not a
[1:46:12] devil out of hell can take it from you.
[1:46:14] Thank you, Lord. So, we're rejoice in
[1:46:16] these things. Amen. So, I I drank
[1:46:20] tonight. I feel good. And we just
[1:46:23] pressing on and uh sorry, brother Ron,
[1:46:25] but I did sneak in on
[1:46:27] you. Praise the Lord. But I said I'mma
[1:46:30] sneak in on him. But that'll be
[1:46:33] disrespectful if I didn't go to church.
[1:46:35] Amen. I said I'm going to go to church.
[1:46:38] I'm gonna be late. I planned it all out
[1:46:41] and it worked
[1:46:43] perfectly. Amen. So, we thank God. I
[1:46:47] appreciate brother Ron. Matter of fact,
[1:46:50] what it call? I called you about three
[1:46:52] weeks ago, I believe it was. I called
[1:46:54] him about three weeks ago. You know, I
[1:46:56] hardly ever listen to preaching online
[1:47:00] and so forth. I mostly just listen to
[1:47:01] Brother Brandon, but every now and then,
[1:47:04] uh, I I'll just listen to something. And
[1:47:08] then brother Ron popped up when he was
[1:47:10] preaching about the pope that really and
[1:47:13] it was a good mess. I just called and
[1:47:14] said, "Brother, let me give you a rose
[1:47:16] now. Praise the Lord. Let me give you a
[1:47:19] rose now because we we we feast and we
[1:47:22] feed for one another." Yes, we do. You
[1:47:25] know what I believe with all of my
[1:47:28] heart? If
[1:47:30] ministers would just appreciate one
[1:47:32] another, Amen. for exactly who they are.
[1:47:36] Amen. We can do more help to the body of
[1:47:40] Christ
[1:47:42] I can't preach like him. He can't preach
[1:47:44] like me. But when we can respect one
[1:47:47] another exactly the way God made us,
[1:47:51] it'll be a whole lot better place,
[1:47:52] wouldn't it? Can we say praise the
[1:47:55] Lordise? Because this is the work of the
[1:47:57] Lord. It's not the work of man. It's the
[1:48:01] work of the Lord. I believe it. And I
[1:48:03] believe audit and I believe as well with
[1:48:06] everything falling in place now it gonna
[1:48:08] come to a place we ain't gonna have time
[1:48:10] to debate with each other about quotes
[1:48:12] and stuff like this. We going to realize
[1:48:14] no it's time to come together cuz we
[1:48:17] need to get up out of here is that
[1:48:19] right? I just thank God for his grace
[1:48:22] and mercy. I'm extremely tired in my
[1:48:24] body but not in my spirit. I can promise
[1:48:28] you that we always ready and prepared
[1:48:30] for battle because when this when the
[1:48:33] enemy come in like a flood, the spirit
[1:48:36] of God are raising a standard against
[1:48:38] what he was actually preaching as well.
[1:48:40] Praise the Lord about them anointings
[1:48:42] that are coming. But I believe we up on
[1:48:44] that eagle anointing. Amen. We can fly
[1:48:46] above all of these things. Can we say
[1:48:48] praise the Lord? Praise the Lord. Where
[1:48:50] the brother when the brother was talking
[1:48:52] about the eagle. Uh I get excited when
[1:48:55] you talk about eagles. When an eagle is
[1:48:58] in a war, whatever is fighting, if
[1:49:01] you're dealing with something on the
[1:49:02] ground to try to come to it, baby, a
[1:49:06] eagle position itself so that the sun
[1:49:08] behind you.
[1:49:11] Hallelujah.
[1:49:12] It position itself to make sure the sun
[1:49:15] is behind him and whatever is fighting
[1:49:17] the sun shine in his eye. Amen. So it
[1:49:20] can't see him.
[1:49:22] I just want to be positioned in the
[1:49:24] word. Keep Christ before me. Amen. And
[1:49:27] just keep my heart, my mind, my
[1:49:29] conscience pure. Cuz I tell you friends,
[1:49:32] we are not losers, right? We are
[1:49:35] winners. Amen. I don't care how much you
[1:49:37] feel about yourself, you need to look
[1:49:38] towards Calvary cuz God does not have a
[1:49:42] defeated bride. We're not a defeated
[1:49:44] people. We more than conquerors. Can we
[1:49:47] say amen? Thank you, Jesus. I pray for
[1:49:50] Ron, could I start preaching? Let's just
[1:49:53] let's just bow our hearts. Father, we so
[1:49:56] thank you for the word. It's good to be
[1:49:59] here to be refreshed. Yes, Lord. Just by
[1:50:03] hearing the prayer word, Lord God, how
[1:50:06] it strengthens
[1:50:07] us. I didn't look for no kind of
[1:50:10] entertainment. I didn't look for
[1:50:12] something to watch on the YouTube to try
[1:50:15] to strengthen me and encourage me. No
[1:50:19] activity, nothing like that. But I look
[1:50:23] into you. Yes. I look into your word
[1:50:26] because I know with everything you do,
[1:50:28] whatever you going to do, you're going
[1:50:30] to do it in your word. So, Father, I
[1:50:33] thank you for giving me a drink from the
[1:50:34] weapon, the word of God. And so, our
[1:50:38] brother was saying, Lord, this weapon
[1:50:40] you given us, like the prophet said, you
[1:50:43] gave your children, you fortified them
[1:50:45] by the best thing that you can give
[1:50:47] them. You fortified them by your word.
[1:50:50] And oh God, that word that you gave them
[1:50:52] is the same word we have today. This
[1:50:55] weapon don't have to be upgraded.
[1:50:58] This weapon don't have to be changed.
[1:51:00] This weapon is real. The original
[1:51:05] Oh God, we have the same word that you
[1:51:07] used even yourself when you faced the
[1:51:10] enemy. When all the believers of old
[1:51:12] faced the enemy, Paul, all they use this
[1:51:15] very same word. Amen. Amen. But the
[1:51:17] thing of it is in this day, Lord, you
[1:51:20] brought a restoration of the word. And
[1:51:23] we're so thankful for that. And Lord, I
[1:51:25] pray that we would leave the church
[1:51:27] tonight just energized. And I thank you
[1:51:30] for this. Let me be here to be into thy
[1:51:33] presence. So, Father, we give you the
[1:51:35] glory and honor in the name of Jesus
[1:51:37] Christ, we pray. And the church says,
[1:51:40] "Amen." Amen. God bless you. God bless
[1:51:42] you, brother. Amen. Amen. Let's all
[1:51:45] stand together and go bless you,
[1:51:50] brother.
[1:51:52] Amen. We forgive brother
[1:51:55] Burley. He came in in secret but
[1:51:59] revealed openly. Amen. I'm glad he had
[1:52:03] respect to the house of God. How could
[1:52:05] you go somewhere when they're having
[1:52:08] church sit?
[1:52:11] There just something inside you.
[1:52:14] that you go and you become a part of it
[1:52:16] and put your feet down. And brother
[1:52:18] Burley, we love you. Appreciate you. May
[1:52:20] the Lord bless your ministry up north as
[1:52:22] you go up there. Amen. Enjoyed the word
[1:52:26] tonight. Saving the best for last. Why
[1:52:29] did God send this
[1:52:31] prophet with this message?
[1:52:35] Because he saved the best.
[1:52:40] the revealing of the full word of God.
[1:52:44] All the mysteries, no more guessing,
[1:52:48] no more
[1:52:50] probing. He saved the
[1:52:53] best for last. Isn't that lovely? Thank
[1:52:56] you, Lord.
[1:52:57] Amen. He is higher than the highest,
[1:53:04] greater than the great. No one can ever
[1:53:09] take his crown away.
[1:53:14] He's more mighty than the
[1:53:18] highest. He reigns from
[1:53:23] above. He's the all time
[1:53:28] undisputed
[1:53:30] undefeated champion of love. One more
[1:53:33] time.
[1:53:36] He is higher than the
[1:53:39] highest, greater than the
[1:53:43] great. No one will ever take his ground
[1:53:48] away.
[1:53:51] He's more mighty than the
[1:53:54] mightest he from.
[1:54:00] He's the
[1:54:02] alltime
[1:54:04] undisputed
[1:54:06] undefeated champion of God bless you.
[1:54:11] You are dismissed in the name of the
[1:54:13] Lord.
