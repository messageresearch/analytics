[48:19] the back of the church that's a long
[48:23] church and uh
[48:27] more so that's brother ma uh aesa aesa
[48:33] our brother is here so uh I brought him
[48:37] over there last week so he was
[48:38] testifying to the Believers and they
[48:42] love him they taught his uh dad of
[48:46] brother
[48:47] ilas
[48:50] sabala and uh after that uh I was
[48:53] preaching Friday night
[48:56] and while I was preaching I felt
[48:59] something to call if anyone wants to be
[49:03] baptized and there were hands that uh
[49:08] you know raised their hands and uh they
[49:10] want to be
[49:11] baptized and I was thinking because it's
[49:14] a big church the that's the second level
[49:17] uh the first level is a kitchen but at
[49:20] the same time maybe there's a a bathtub
[49:23] over there so I was thinking if I I
[49:26] challenge the Believers I will baptize
[49:29] you tonight if you want to be
[49:32] baptized and after that I I gave it to
[49:36] the pastor and the Pastor said let's go
[49:39] to the
[49:42] beach and it's 35 to 40 minutes
[49:47] drive
[49:49] so we went to the beach at M midnight
[49:53] it's good to see you brother uh uh
[49:56] Martin from uh Canada I was with brother
[50:00] Stan over there he said hi to
[50:04] you and then um so we we went to paa
[50:10] they the Baghdad that's the name of the
[50:13] the the place and that's a a a a cartel
[50:20] City so the brother the Deacon called

[50:50] baptismal one school bus and nine vans
[50:56] so when we were there there was a very
[50:59] fast um
[51:01] F-150 and then behind me behind us are I
[51:05] think it's a Chevy Subban and the plate
[51:09] number was
[51:11] Nebraska and so I I I thought the
[51:15] cartels are
[51:19] Mexicans so uh
[51:24] so

[1:12:07] happy when they were playing with their
[1:12:09] Harps he said we hang our Harps upon the
[1:12:13] Willow in the midst
[1:12:16] thereof the whipping Willow

[1:14:48] Satan is telling you how can you sing to
[1:14:50] the Lord you're doing your filth outside
[1:14:53] side and then you come here and sing to
[1:14:55] him shame on
[1:14:58] you and you Believers that doing that I
[1:15:02] experience it amen we will experience

[1:16:52] language over there in heaven is French
[1:16:55] I said I think it's
[1:17:01] Filipino he said because the the the uh
[1:17:04] the the brother prophesied in

[1:17:14] said here in Acts chapter
[1:17:18] 16 19 to 25 I will and when her master
[1:17:24] saw this this this
[1:17:27] man this possessed

[1:17:59] magistrate rent off their clothes and
[1:18:02] commanded to beat them and when they had
[1:18:06] laid many stripes upon them this is Paul
[1:18:09] and
[1:18:10] Silas upon them they cast them into uh
[1:18:15] prison into prison charging the charging
[1:18:18] the Jailer to keep them safely who have
[1:18:23] having received such a charge trust them
[1:18:26] into the inner prison and made their
[1:18:30] feet fast into
[1:18:33] stocks Paul and Silas are not criminals
[1:18:37] they're inside the prison at that the
[1:18:39] same time they tied their
[1:18:44] feet and unto the and into the inner
[1:18:47] prison and at
[1:18:50] midnight Paul and Silas
[1:18:54] prayed and sang Praises unto God and the
[1:18:58] prisoners heard them so they're not like
[1:19:03] singing
[1:19:05] praying in just two of them can hear it
[1:19:09] they were praying loud voice with a loud

[1:19:19] heard them the whole prisoners heard

[1:19:44] you praise

[1:19:53] situation they did not look the pain
[1:19:57] they did not check how big is the the
[1:19:59] swollen in their
[1:20:01] legs but in the midnight they were
[1:20:05] singing a song of Victory because they
[1:20:09] were beat for the cause of Christ
[1:20:12] hallelujah amen I bless your name how
[1:20:16] can you bless if you're in pain but to

[1:20:33] Him Watchman how many knows
[1:20:36] Watchman he was a a missionary
[1:20:40] evangelist from
[1:20:43] China when he accepted the message or
[1:20:48] that when he accepted
[1:20:51] Christ he started sharing the Gospel
[1:20:56] wherever he go but then the Comm
[1:20:58] communist
[1:21:00] China came in in
[1:21:04] 1949 they persecuted maong said religion
[1:21:09] is poison so all ministers all
[1:21:13] Christians we will put them to jail or
[1:21:15] into the to the prison
[1:21:18] camp and you know what happened Watchman
[1:21:23] was preaching the gospel he didn't care
[1:21:26] they put him into prison but in prison
[1:21:29] he kept writing he kept writing about
[1:21:33] about the love of God and you know what
[1:21:37] he died in
[1:21:38] prison for uh he was in prison for 21 uh
[1:21:44] 21
[1:21:47] years they supposed to release him but
[1:21:50] the government said EXT extend him he's
[1:21:55] dangerous they extended until he died
[1:21:59] the family did not see the
[1:22:01] body because they don't want they want
[1:22:03] to erase that watch money to the whole
[1:22:08] China but then the Watchman was
[1:22:12] writing he said
[1:22:14] here the happiest
[1:22:17] persons are not always the one who have
[1:22:21] the loudest praise
[1:22:25] the loudest praise comes very often from
[1:22:30] the one who are passing through
[1:22:35] hardship that kind of
[1:22:38] Praise most pleasing to God and is
[1:22:43] blessed by
[1:22:46] him God does not want men to praise him
[1:22:52] only when when they are in the
[1:22:57] Mountaintop surveying Canaan the promis
[1:23:01] land God desires much more to see his
[1:23:05] people writing Psalms and praising him
[1:23:10] when they walk through the valley of the
[1:23:12] Shadows of
[1:23:15] death Glory it's good if you have money
[1:23:19] to praise God right but what about if
[1:23:22] you don't have food in your
[1:23:25] table what about if you're if you see
[1:23:29] cancers eating your
[1:23:32] body what about if your your loved ones
[1:23:37] are telling you I'm not going to church
[1:23:40] with you
[1:23:42] anymore it's
[1:23:44] painful but it's good to praise God very
[1:23:51] good
[1:23:55] there was a
[1:23:57] man in
[1:24:00] 1800 this man they put him into a a uh
[1:24:05] uh
[1:24:07] uh into a mental
[1:24:12] institution but then when he
[1:24:16] died the the the people from that
[1:24:19] building went in and cleaned his body
[1:24:24] took his body and cleaned the the the
[1:24:27] room and on the
[1:24:30] wall there was a word
[1:24:32] said could we with ink the ocean
[1:24:36] fill and where the Skies of parchment
[1:24:40] made where every stock on earth a quail
[1:24:44] and every man ascribed by trade to write
[1:24:47] the love of God would drain the ocean
[1:24:49] dry that's right come on
[1:24:53] not could the scroll contain the hole
[1:24:56] through stretch from Sky to
[1:24:59] Sky if I will write the love of God if
[1:25:03] we will write our
[1:25:05] testimonies our pains and
[1:25:08] victories it will contain the whole
[1:25:11] world because of the love of God Amen
[1:25:14] that's right to them it's a crazy man
[1:25:17] but to God is a faithful
[1:25:20] servant sometimes
[1:25:23] sometimes we can create a
[1:25:26] song from our
[1:25:28] hearts brother Justin can can compose a
[1:25:32] song because of his experience you're
[1:25:35] not composing a song brother Justin or

[1:39:31] this the prophet said here Revelation
[1:39:34] chap 68 Satan

[1:39:42] Followed
[1:39:44] him that was the
[1:39:47] Destroyer they destroyed everything
[1:39:52] he
[1:39:54] said who was them see all right
[1:39:58] Antichrist called that hell and follow
[1:40:00] uh hell follow watch this four point
[1:40:05] scheme
[1:40:07] Antichrist the White Horse kills the
[1:40:10] spirit being
[1:40:12] Antichrist Spirit kills the number two
[1:40:15] red horse kills the sword political
[1:40:18] power when church and St State United
[1:40:22] black horse Souls when he gave out his
[1:40:26] Doctrine and she did there with their
[1:40:30] fornication and the weight out of their
[1:40:33] food by this uh by a sold their what
[1:40:37] they give for food for a balance uh and
[1:40:40] the
[1:40:41] pennies and so forth number
[1:40:45] four Fort and Pale Horse Eternal
[1:40:49] separation from God again 4 C he said
[1:40:55] look at this Satan when Moses was
[1:40:59] singing he was singing about the
[1:41:03] horses of the
[1:41:06] Egyptians their enemy was the
[1:41:09] Pharaoh but the Pharaoh sent his
[1:41:14] horses in the last days our enemy are
[1:41:18] the four horses also Satan is
[1:41:22] riding to four powers to destroy the
[1:41:28] Believers to destroy the world exactly
[1:41:32] and most of the people went in to his
[1:41:37] vices but there are few Believers that
[1:41:41] overcame the black horse the White Horse
[1:41:45] the red horse and The Pale Horse because
[1:41:49] God also was riding to this four
[1:41:54] beast when Satan was riding to the White
[1:41:57] Horse the spirit of the Lord ride with
[1:42:00] Paul the lion amen when Satan changed
[1:42:05] the the horse to the to the black
[1:42:08] horse to the red
[1:42:11] horse God was riding also with the
[1:42:17] ox now all the powers are com uh
[1:42:21] fighting to each
[1:42:23] other Satan always think that he will
[1:42:26] win the battle but in the last days he
[1:42:30] joined all the powers the Catholics
[1:42:33] Catholic power the political power and
[1:42:37] then the mark of the beast but then in
[1:42:40] the last days also once he gathered all
[1:42:43] the powers the White Horse the red horse
[1:42:46] and the black horse became Pale
[1:42:49] Horse and this horse is so shiny so
[1:42:55] tempting but it's death that's right
[1:42:58] that's right but look at the
[1:43:01] Believers God gathered all his people
[1:43:04] also from the four corners of the
[1:43:08] world the prophet said
[1:43:11] here oh
[1:43:13] now in Revelation chapter
[1:43:16] 19 not only is the is gathering
[1:43:21] is getting ready but Christ is getting
[1:43:25] ready ready to meet him the battle is to
[1:43:29] be hot and heavy Christ in Revelation 19
[1:43:33] Christ is gathering his not from the
[1:43:36] four corners of the Earth because
[1:43:39] there's going to be a battle be uh uh uh
[1:43:45] battle uh going to be little B Remnant
[1:43:50] what's he doing he is gathering them
[1:43:53] from the four corners of
[1:43:55] heaven will get them Sals under the
[1:43:58] altars tomorrow uh this is a promise and
[1:44:02] when you see where it's right or not
[1:44:05] four corners of Heaven on a Snow White
[1:44:09] Horse Satan has a a white horse but God
[1:44:14] has a Snow White
[1:44:17] Horse
[1:44:19] amen
[1:44:22] these are the
[1:44:23] Believers he also has a name not
[1:44:27] that but the word of
[1:44:32] God the word of God life amen God wrote
[1:44:37] right on his uh thighe here the word of
[1:44:41] God that's the only life because God is
[1:44:44] the only source of eternal life there is
[1:44:48] soe and he he has got Thro life riding
[1:44:53] on a white horse and here is a man with
[1:44:57] three different powers mix up cette
[1:45:00] Gathering his Earthbound
[1:45:03] delegates and Christ is gathering his
[1:45:07] heaven born subject

[1:46:12] four
[1:46:14] Beast the B the White Horse the red
[1:46:16] horse the black horse it became Pale
