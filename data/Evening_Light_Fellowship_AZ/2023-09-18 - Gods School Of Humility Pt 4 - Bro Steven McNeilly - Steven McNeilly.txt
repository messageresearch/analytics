our heart is speaking this morning Lord and may it be a real praise and a real sweet smelling Savor in your nostrils Lord we ask that you would bless the word this morning and that you would come and speak to our hearts and Lord God that you would multiply the bread and the fish multiply the word to our heart Lord we love you father we thank you we thank you for meeting the needs within our assembly in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord thank you musicians we welcome you into the house of the Lord this morning and it's always good to be in God's presence amen if you have your Bibles turned with me to the Book of Luke Luke chapter 18 and we'll read verses 12 through 14. Hallelujah Luke chapter 18. and verse 12. and it's reads like this it says uh will actually start from verse 10 I'm sorry the verse 10 says two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a publican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers are even as this publican my what an attitude this Pharisee had I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess he was a pretty good believer he was a very religious righteous man in his own eyes [Applause] [Music] verse 13 says in the public and standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes onto heaven but smote upon his breasts saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted turn with me to the Book of Mark chapter 9. well read verses 33 and 34. and if you haven't guessed already we're going to continue our thought on Pride Mark chapter 9 and verse 33 and says but they understood not no and he came to Capernaum and being in the house he asked them what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way but they held their peace I wonder why they held their peace because when they were asked about it they realized how silly it was what they were disputing about that's right he says but they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest my may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word this morning you may be seated I would like to title my sermon this morning God School of humility this is part four and I would like to take for the subject of Pride within the church Pride within the church and in the sermon Pride 1955 brother Branham says o Pride's such a cursed thing so awful so evil is pride so the next time that we see Pride Lift being lifted up in our hearts this quote should come back to our memory that pride is such a cursed thing it is so awful and it is very evil Hallelujah now uh so we realize that um pride is one of these things that all of us deal with in certain ways pride is no respecter of persons pride is not just for the rich and for the famous but pride is for the meek and the lowly believe it or not pride is found in many ways shapes and forms Pride can be found in in in ways and places that we never thought was possible it's very interesting that when we think of Pride we just think of a person who boasts and brags a lot a person with self-confidence a person with uh uh perhaps we think of somebody who thinks they're better than everybody else but as we said the last time as I'm sure you all remember that that is not so that Pride can be found in the Low Places of Our Lives it can be it is so subtle sometimes it is so Sly sometimes and it sneaks its way in very subtly and very quietly without us even realizing it and so my desire is is that when we preach on such subjects as this it's uh it's to shine a light on a subject that whenever the issue would arise in our hearts and in our lives that first off we would recognize it and after we recognize that it's in our lives then we can do something about it because what's the point in just recognizing something but not doing anything about it and so I don't want to be like as uh how would I put it as a barking dog and and bark about pride and bark about this but I want to expose Satan this morning in his dark places so that when it does arise in our lives because guess what this thing called Pride it is it is mixed within the DNA of humanity and so if you're a human being if you are vertical and you're still breathing guess what there's a there's a certain amount of pride in each and every one of our lives but it just shows itself differently in different people according to their characters so some might say well I'm very quiet I don't have pride well I would say that that's your pride that is speaking well I'm I'm I'm an introvert and I'm and I'm not out here like everybody else and I don't think that that sermon applies to me I would say that that is your pride that is speaking within your heart so we find out that as individuals we all have different issues and different things that we deal with for some people it might be music for other people it might be uh it might be video games and it might be movies for some others it might be the pride of life and the lust of the Flesh and some mighty might have a hard time with some of those things and not with others but it's not so with pride all of us well you believe it or not have an issue with pride Hallelujah I feel it is very important to minister on these things because what it does is it exposes Satan within our lives and it helps us to recognize it and and like I've already said when we recognize it it is up to us now to do something about it that when we see him Rising his ugly awful evil head we can say aha I know that spirit I know what's happening here so now by the word of God I'm gonna cut his head off and so how do you how do you kill something how do you cut its head off well you take the sword of the word and you say the word of God says that pride is a very evil thing and I don't want it in my life so therefore I rebuke it it's kind of interesting how do you overcome Pride how is it that we overcome something that that when it's usually too late when we notice that it's Pride if that makes sense you're already prideful it's already happened and then you go oh my goodness there it is again raise his ugly head there's that evil thing in my life again ah so how do we overcome it we overcome it by humility and how do you overcome it by humility because usually pride is when it's against someone else so how do you make it right with someone else as you say I'm sorry whether it's to your wife to your kids to somebody else within the assembly how do you overcome Pride by saying you're sorry Hallelujah easier said than done young man I know it but that's how you overcome it brother Branham says how do you overcome anything you do the opposite of what it is amen so Luke Chapter 5 and we'll read verses 1 through 11. uh it says and I and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of geneserate and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him that he would Thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let your nets down for a drought and Simon answering said unto him Master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing and I love this he says nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net and I think that's a very good example for us this morning that it doesn't matter how many times we've prayed how many times we've asked how many times we've cried out onto the Lord for deliverance of something but yet at Thy word Lord it doesn't matter how long I've waited it doesn't matter of the circumstance but Lord at Thy word I will do what you say notice what happens and when they had done this this when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they beckoned onto their Partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ship so that they began to sink this was quite a multitude of fish now notice the reaction of Simon Peter here when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the at the drought of the fishes which they had taken understand they were fishermen they were professionals they knew what they were doing they had fished all night they hadn't caught anything but yet at the word of the Lord at the word of the Lord here was this great multitude of fish I'm sure he was seeing dollar signs flash right before his eyes he couldn't believe it he was astonished how can these things be with God The Impossible is always possible and and so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not from henceforth Thou shalt catch men and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and they followed him now the reaction of Peter here is is very astounding to me because Peter realized that he was in the presence of somebody very special that's right he knew he he had heard him preach he he was he heard his Doctrine he heard how he taught the people no doubt he saw the people on the land that were following him and and no doubt he thought this is a very special person indeed now brother Branham tells us that Peter's um father was a very spiritual man and he would always teach his boys and say there's there's one that's coming like an unto Moses and he'll be a prophet and and don't worry there'll be there'll be many people that'll arise and they'll be they'll be the false anointed but that doesn't take away from the one true one that we're waiting for so number one they were taught right they were taught what to look for and so no doubt when he's seen it come before his very eyes he thought my the presence that this man has the doctrine that he teaches and even at his word this great multitude of fish that we have caught he is an extremely special person he was in the presence of God almighty now what happens when you're in the presence of God guess what it'll bring a sinner to his knees it'll bring a person who is high and and lifted up within themselves into a place of humility and safe I am not worthy Lord I am not worthy to be in your presence for I am a sinful man I am a man of unclean lips I dwell amongst people with unclean lips and unclean ears it doesn't matter if the state that you're in when he calls you he's not looking at that State but he's looking to the Future hallelujah how many of you can say I remember that time I remember when God was dealing with my heart I remember when the Holy Spirit was moving in my life and I just couldn't take it anymore being in that presence I had to surrender all if you haven't come to that spot yet I pray that you do because your life will never ever be the same again why because you came in to his presence it's not a special sermon that changes your life it's not just something that somebody randomly says one time no it's the very presence of God that's what changes the life of a person hallelujah how important it is for us to be in the presence of God not just a church on a Sunday not just at church on a Wednesday night but every day it's important for us to be in the presence of God to seek his face through prayer to listen to the sermons to read his word what are you doing when you do these things you're sensitizing your heart you're sensitizing your spirit Hallelujah that when he comes by you recognize his presence oh my you remember that time I remember you know what it felt like I I'll never forget it it felt like there was a weight that lifted off of my back felt like I was carrying this load that I didn't even realize I was carrying but when I surrendered my heart to God guess what this loaded it it came off of my back what was it it was the it was the load of sin it was the shame of sin it was the shame of iniquity and I didn't even know I was carrying it God will take that chip off your shoulder if you ever get into his presence one time God will change that bad attitude if you ever get into his presence one time amen but as life goes on and we get familiar with God we get familiar with prayer we get familiar with reading his word when you first came to the Lord and you had a really good experience guess what he really nothing would hold you back from reading his word at night amen nothing would hold you back from a sincere prayer to God and and and and and praying for Revelation and praying for your family and praying for your loved ones but we get too familiar with God we get too familiar with his word we get too familiar with prayer and you know what familiarity breeds content and so before long we get to a place where ah we're not on fire where we should be we're not as sincere as we once were our heart is not a flame and burning like it once was why because we're too familiar with God you got to get back to the basics back to how it was that sensitivity with God we often say well God doesn't speak to me like he used to I beg to differ your spirit and your heart is not as sensitive as it used to be say brother Stephen how do you know because I'm speaking by experience I ain't pointing fingers at you I'm preaching right at myself we get so familiar and so caught up with life that guess what we get familiar with God God help us that as the time draws nearer to his coming that we'd be like brother Paul love all and we're sending emails 10 emails a day this word is awesome this is awesome why he's feeding upon the word Hallelujah so as we follow the life of Peter Peter's a very interesting character as we follow his life you see that Peter had many ups and downs in his life we see that here he was when he started out with God he was he was humbled he had a humble he had a humble State he didn't care if the other fishing boats were around he didn't care who else was around but he was at a place where he's where he recognized the sin in his life and and he got onto his knees and he said oh God I'm a sinful man I shouldn't be in your presence but it's very interesting as time goes on and he follows the Lord and He forsakes all and he leaves everything and and he's a really good believer he gets so familiar with the Lord that one time he was the Lord was thronged by people people were touching him all over the place and the Lord said who touched me he perceived that virtue and went out of his body and now here is Peter a man who was once humble a man who was once very sincere with God and recognized that he was a sinful man he says Lord what are you talking about can't be saying that around everybody everybody's touching you don't say that they're going to think you're crazy they're going to think that I'm crazy for following you brother Branham says he rebuked the Lord can you imagine his pride got so lifted up within himself that he rebuked the Lord and he said be quiet you can't say stuff like that around the people everybody's touching you but Peter had failed to recognize that something Supernatural was going on so it is with us because of our pride and carnality we we forget and we miss the very moving of God amongst us because we're looking at the wrong thing amen hahaha so he starts off in humility and now he gets high and lifted up so we get to another point in his life where the Lord is talking about uh the son of man must must be crucified and on the third day Rise Again from the dead and all these different things and Peter says not so Lord that's not going to happen so now Jesus turns to Peter and he says I rebuke thee Satan can you imagine being Peter at that time he just called me a could you imagine I'm sure that Peter doubted his experience when he first met the Lord here he is and then we find another place about Peter and he's taken up to the Mount of transfiguration and no doubt it was a an amazing experience it was a Bethel experience he saw Moses and Elijah and he saw the Lord and his arraignment had changed and he was transfigured and he heard a voice hear ye him but yet then he's called the devil so then Peter there's a storm and here comes the Lord walking on the waters notice Peter's life the ups and downs he said Lord of that be you let me come as Faith was strong the Bible says that Peter walked on water everybody likes to say oh doubtful Peter I would like to see some of us walking on water realize that Peter had a certain amount of faith in order to do this but yet here he is walking on water a supernatural experience has taken place but then he begins to sink because he's looking at his surroundings around him so he goes from up here to down here he goes from the level of Faith the level of my goodness Supernatural things are happening and then he's rebuked for his unbelief can you see the ups and downs of Peter's life he has Supernatural experiences and then he's humbled he has a supernatural experience and then he's humbled he has a supernatural experience and then he's humbled has it ever happened to any of you where it seems like God is moving in your life you have a supernatural experience he he he gives you a word and due season he gives you something and you feel real good you feel like you're in Cloud Nine and you feel like God really moved and did something for you in the service but then the next day it seems like you're back to your old self again and then a little while down the line and it happens again and it happens again and it happens again and you begin to think my goodness what's wrong with me there's nothing wrong with you God is just keeping you humble [Laughter] because if we were always on cloud nine with all these Supernatural experiences and nothing can bother us guess what will be a spoiled brat so what God has to do is he has to take us through this life's journey of ups and downs of ups and downs of ups and downs it has nothing to do with the seed he's just keeping your carnal man under check because God dwells in humility Peter he goes he goes Lord I'll never deny you ever he says oh Peter before the crows you'll demand you'll deny me twice it's very interesting we always think about Peter denying the Lord I want to ask you where were the other disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane where was everybody where was the Beloved John who would do no wrong and Jesus loved them so much and he loved Jesus where was he when they were taking him to be crucified he ran with everybody else so it wasn't only Peter that was humbled but it was the rest of the disciples can you imagine here there was the man that they loved they thought he was the Messiah but yet at the first time that there was any kind of um what's the word conflict thank you any kind of conflict hey they ran like scared rats when there's conflict there's something happening in the church it's not a time to run it's a time to put your feet in the ground it's a time to get your knees on the ground and pray for the situations not to run off and go everywhere else stay your ground fight the good fight of faith in the Book of Luke it almost broke my heart when I read this here was Peter and he was standing afar off and here there was he that already asked him if oh well surely you're one of those and and you're one of his followers and he says no I'm not and the Bible says in the Book of Luke that g the crew and Jesus turned and looked at Peter and then he knew when he remembered the saying of the Lord and the Bible says he wept bitterly I feel like weeping with them how many times throughout the week are we denying the Lord by denying him our time how many times throughout the week are we denying the Lord by not saying what we should be saying to to somebody that's in need to helping somebody that's in need around us I wonder if we can see the face of the Lord and if we could hear the the crowing of the rooster behind us every time that we deny the Lord while we're here on this Earth how would it make us feel oh God we're a sinful people ah but the Blood Hallelujah covers it all elujah Luke chapter 18 verses 11 and 12. it says the Pharisees stood and prayed thus within himself as our opening scripture God I thank thee that I'm not as other men are extortioners and unjust and adulterers or even as his publican I fast twice in the week and I give tithes of all that I possess here is a man he didn't try to hide his pride at all notice I'm talking about Pride within the church I'm going somewhere like this not just with in our lives but within a church body not just evening Light Fellowship but the body of Jesus Christ around the world not to jump ahead of myself but I believe that pride is running rampant a long message ranks right now so here was this man and he was an extremely religious man he was a Pharisee you couldn't put a pin on his life you couldn't say well I saw this man doing this and and I saw this man doing that and he's a sinner no he was a Pharisee extremely religious he fasted twice in the week not only did he pay tithes on the money that he earned but upon all of his possessions I wonder how many of us are like that this morning or do we just give the bare minimum do we just give it down to the to the sin are are we outgiven God understand we can never outgive the Lord he was a good church member no doubt he helped out amongst in the Assembly of the rest of the Pharisees no doubt he was a man of good works a very spiritual man but yet there was something in his life that was missing there was something within his life and within his heart that just wasn't quite right there was something off with him and understand even if other people cannot see it God sees it and God understands whenever this Pharisee got lifted up in his heart you know what it did to all of his tithing to all of his good works to all of his fasting and to all of these other things and absolutely annulled all of it it was worthless it was pointless it was all in vain why because he had a prideful heart because of the way that he was looking at at another person because of the way that he was looking at this public and he said this guy is a Publican he's a sinner he's he's a tax collector for the Romans against his own people how in the world could he do that he's a sinner I'm glad I'm not like this guy but yet here was a sinner doesn't say he paid ties doesn't say he went to church it doesn't say that he did any good works or anything like that but because his heart was in the right place because he realized the sin that he was living in he said oh God forgive me a sinner that is the kind of heart that God wants and that is the kind of person that God can use within the assembly all is good works everything that he did that was good every uh all of it hey guess what it was annulled because this guy went away Justified rather than this guy so what happened no doubt he started out well and no doubt he started out with a good heart with the right intentions to Serve the People with the right intentions to help those in need with the right intentions to help support the church with his tithings and his offerings and all these different things but throughout the course of time something changed in his heart just like Peter when he started out he was a humble man but yet something changed in his heart that Pride had gotten lifted up and he rebuked the very Lord that he was serving I wonder how many of us we start out good we start out humble we start out soft our nature is soft our heart is soft our spirit is soft God has picked us out of the Mary clay and he's he set us Upon This Rock and and and and we can feel the loving arms of God but throughout time we get so familiar and we think we're doing so good well I do this within the assembly and I do that and I serve this and I pay that and I I I I I I'm before long pride gets lifted within our hearts that when we see somebody else within the assembly within the body of Christ around the world that perhaps is not doing right we're so quick to cast the stones we're so quick to point fingers we're so quick to say well I'm glad my family ain't like that my kids are doing good how's yours huh oh yeah you know why I'm really asking because I know they're struggling yeah tell me tell me about it what happens started out right continued to be right but somewhere along the line something changed something happened and the humility that God wants dwelt in turned into Pride which is an ugly awful thing evil thing in the sight of God Amen I wonder how many of us has got pride in our hearts towards families of of that are less fortunate within the assembly kids that are having a hard time ah we could go on and on I wonder when the last time was that we actually prayed for the family and for the person and for the situation listen this is Christianity 101. but we get so caught up with the algebra of the message that we leave off the beginnings we leave off the basics we leave off the foundation of which our faith is built upon and we get so caught up with with the mysteries of God and the Seven Seals and and it's wonderful and and I enjoy studying it and everything like that but what good is it if we're leaving this off back here Mighty Within that he forgot what Christianity is all about the God of this evil age 1965 brother Branham said he said if you would have believed Moses he's talking about religious people here you would have believed me for Moses spoke of me and still they didn't see it the very God Of Heaven dying on the cross and saying the same words the prophet said he would say and still they didn't see it see they were not of his kind they was not the word not the word and yet they were very religious but they was not the word it would have recognized its place for that hour when I read that it it struck me deeply that being religious and having a form of religion guess what it's not good enough that's not good enough to just go to church and pay your tithes and and serve the people and go through all these rituals but it's the word will bring forth after its kind after his kind so if it was all about just being religious there'd be Many religious people that would be okay that have never been born again so I got to thinking about this and I thought my what is the message really about where is it taking us to is this message from a man was it given by a man and is its Revelation given by a man the answer to those questions are all no that's right it is not given by a man it was given by God Almighty it is not inspired by man it was inspired by God and it is not revealed by man but it is revealed by God [Applause] so therefore whenever the word is preached the word within us will say Amen to the word that is preached and everybody says amen so now when brother Branham who's preaching this word that is given by God and is inspired by God if we are of that same word if we are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh we are going to respond by an Amen brother Branham says you'll punctuate it by an amen so when he comes and he preaches and he says you men he says you need to stop the dirty jokes whenever he tells us to stop the dirty jokes the word preached the word in our heart responds to the word and says amen when he tells us that combing our hair a certain way and wearing Suede Shoes is uh is is is um perverted the word within our hearts responds to the word and says amen why because we believe that this message is inspired and it's given of God so when the word preached and he talks about the women not cutting her hair and that wearing clothes immoral clothes and then different things the word that's within the hearts of our sisters will respond and say Amen why because we know where the word is coming from it is not the word of a man it's not just a man that's trying to tell us what to do and trying to beat us down no it's almighty God that's trying to tell us how to live our lives and so we we take these things we we get so familiar with it because we hear it on every tape and we hear this but this message should not be familiar to us as Believers because it's fresh manna and so when we say Amen we're not just going to punctuate it with an amen from our mouth but we're going to punctuate it with an amen through our lives so when he tells us to do something guess what we're going to take the word we're going to respond with the name man and we're going to apply it to our lives so important because what good is it just recognizing something and not doing anything about it he could preach in the seals and we'll say amen he could preach on the church ages the godhead uh water baptism all these great Mysteries that have been unfolded and we'll say Amen why because we are of the word and we're responding to the word but what happens whenever something gets in the way let me ask you what happens if something gets in the way of us of the Sun what does it create a shadow so whenever something in our lives gets in the way of the word which is the son the s-u-n out here natural the son spiritual whenever something gets in the way of the sun and the natural it creates a shadow so whenever something in our lives an object whatever it might be whenever it gets into the way of the s o n the word of God guess what it creates it creates a shadow on our lives and when something is shadowed when a seed or a flower is shadowed over with and it never gets direct sunlight it will never bring forth to its full potential because a seed or a flower whatever it is it needs direct sunlight it needs water it needs the right ground that it's planted in what do we need we need the Son of God we need the Holy Spirit to water it to take that seed and so that it'll bring forth of its kind but when something's shadowing it will never bring forth of its full potential of what it is it's still a seed still a sun still a daughter but many people's lives they get shadowed over by something what is it a lot of times it's Pride this object of pride raises in our hearts and it's an object that gets between the word of God and the seed that's dwelling within our hearts and what happens is now we begin to look at the word differently so when brother Branham comes along and these guys for an example because I'm a guy it's easier when he says uh don't be wearing those suede shoes and he says and purple so obviously color had something to do with it I don't know people have their own thoughts in that and that's okay go look up the quote if there's something in our hearts an object of Pride or whatever it might be and that word is preached we respond with that was in brother branham's day things have changed today guys can get away with wearing an acting and acting kind of however way they want and they can get away with it they can comb their hair whatever way they want whatever it is our carnal reasoning now begins to respond and instead of responding with the name man that's the truth we respond and say that's that preacher's interpretation we respond and say well that was for that day back then that's not for today whenever he preaches things about a moral dress and skirts and not cutting her hair for her sisters and the women being the uh the the the Homemakers and all these different things whenever there's an object in the way of the word will respond and say well that's not for today that was 50 years ago times have changed how women are treated as changed the everything's different than it was back then why are we responding like that because there's an object in the way of the word and we're not responding to the word like we know we should be we could go on the list is endless but you get where I'm going with this so now what are we supposed to do about it recognize it because the word listen it's nothing to do with the seed your sons and daughters but there's something overshadowing it get rid of the object get rid of the pride get rid of whatever it is that's preventing you to be in the direct sunlight of the word of God Amen and punctuated with an amen not just with your lips but with a life and then say Lord I know your word is true every son and daughter of God that's our desire is to fulfill the word of God in our lives so we say Lord I know your word is true I know my reaction and saying amen isn't what it's supposed to be please help me Lord watch God come on the scene amen amen Hallelujah there's so many things that we can say Amen to to the word of God now we find out that like I already said I believe that the spirit of pride is is running Rampage amongst message believers and message churches all over the world I seen a video of a minister it was last year and he was he took a three-hour it was three hours long and he blasted another Minister for three hours and he said something along these words he said it would take a hundred of this minister to make one of me and they're very known ministers around the world and I thought my goodness is that what this message is producing when I look at brother branham's life and I look at how he conducted himself all I see is humility and so when I see this Pride raising up amongst ministers and amongst the congregations I think there's something wrong somewhere because it's not how it began and if it's not how it began it shouldn't be how it is now and it shouldn't be How It Ends and so we find out that this this pride is amongst churches it's amongst congregations when we think we do we just think about preachers who's beyond the preachers watch with me for a second the thing now that everybody's debating about is who has the greatest balance within the message well this church over here is too quiet there are a bunch of bicycles this church over here is too loud they're a bunch of fanatics but our church us we have the greatest balance amongst the message I don't believe that we realize that what's actually happening is because understand this concept that Pride when I thought about Pride there was one word that came into my mind and that was contentions so where is the contentions coming from amongst message Believers and amongst our rents as coming from Pride well our church has the greatest balance we know just when to clap we know when to be quiet we're not doing this and we're not uh we're not starchy and stiff and we're not this but but you guys over there and then these guys over here are looking over there and they're saying well these guys are too much of this and we have the best desks and we have a better song leader and they sing their songs differently it's not right what is happening with this Pride that is coming up amongst message churches right now it's causing contentions and let me just be very honest gotta stop aren't we don't we believe the same word some we have the same father weren't we born the same way we're aren't we sealed with the same Holy Ghost so why is this raising up amongst us it's because we're not being able to identify what pride is our pastor's the greatest no our pastors the greatest no no no no no no our pastor is the best look at the disciples aren't they arguing amongst themselves who would be the greatest who's the greatest amongst us who's the most important who's the best preacher who's the best congregation who's got the best music who's got the best this and when Jesus asked him about it Mike they got all embarrassed nothing it's just childish yeah it is just childish it's Child's Play and it doesn't belong amongst believers how are we supposed to respond to it brother Stephen just keep our mouths shut your wife about it she'll listen and not tell anybody talk to your husband about it but the fact that we get out now and and everything is so connected through the internet people are taking video screenshots of their phone and they're sending it around it's Minister preached this oh do you think he's preaching it at this person are that they're preaching this at that person and people are so caught up with with the contentions that's amongst us right now that we're forgetting the goal that we're here for and that's to make a rapture that's to get into the word and personal relationship with God Child's Play oh Lord ah nothing it's it's silly we don't really want to answer it yeah it is silly it needs to end because as long as there's Pride there will always be contentions and as long as there's contentions there will never be a Unity as long as there's contentions that's what you're going to keep your eyes focused on rather than the word of God and serving God and serving God's people Hallelujah this Pharisee no doubt he started off serving the people very well but when a man loses his love for the people and I'm talking about all of us collectively when we lose our love for one another we have no effect in each other's lives brother Branham said I lost the feelings for the people his ministry wasn't as effective when he didn't have an effect and a love for the people we are no different and what causes it is the moment that somebody loses their love for the people Pride will take its place and they'll not they'll serve because of an outward appearance oh that's good they'll serve because they they think it looks good everybody else looking at them but yet within their heart they're saying look at that person that I had to help publican um that's what's happening used to be president would say my my church uh um when we would leave everybody would be hugging and crying and there was such a Unity amongst the people such as humility they couldn't wait to see them at the next service again where is this humility went to where is it gone pride has taken its place so when I thought about what is pride done to us as a church body collectively around the world contentions was the word that came to my mind and I was trying to think of other things and it seemed like I was just at a roadblock thinking of it and I thought my perhaps this is the the main thing that the Lord wants me to touch on this morning is contentions why is there contentions amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ because bride cannot persecute Pride so where is the contentions coming from is coming from Pride raising his ugly evil head in our lives in our churches and around the world and we're not aware of it Hallelujah the exact same thing is happening today as what was happening with the disciples an argument at disputing a contention of who's the greatest what does it matter you know what a brother said to me one time and I thought that this was excellent he said brother Stephen there's going to be no churches in heaven no churches elf's not going to be over here this one's not going to be over here this one's not gonna we're not going to have our own streets of churches in heaven so what does it matter I guess it's good for us to have pride of ownership of church and all these different things and and that's a good thing but when it gets to a place of when we're at a point where we're pointing fingers at everybody else's congregation other people's youth group this church is well our youth group is the best and we're better than all the rest that pride is going to bring a fall faster than we know it that's one of the things that the Lord really keeps on top of me with I can't brag on nothing without it breaking it's a fact I get to if I get the bragging about my work truck I like that thing and you know next thing that's going to happen check engine light's going to come on I'm not going to say nothing the other couple months ago me and Miles spent a day together and had to go to Chandler or whatever and it was at that time everybody was getting flat tires it seemed like every three miles there's a flat tire and Miles he told me he said Dad I'm so glad we never get flat tires I was like oh son don't say that he said why it's true I said it's going to happen just watch three days later I'm with Mariah kids were real good so I was going to Chick-fil-A to get them some ice cream and we all know Chick-fil-A has some of the best ice cream so on our way to Chick-fil-A guess what happens get a flat tire like 500 yards from the house what is God doing he's not punishing us he's just keeping us humble I was glad that brother James lives close by to come and help me number one rule make sure you got a good jack in your car huh some of us are knuckleheads that's me yeah make sure it works before you go out because then you know that you know amen uh the Lord knows what we need So within the church body now we see that when pride gets amongst us as Believers we look at each other differently chances are we look down our nose at someone else someone else's Misfortune whatever it might be I I don't know you can fill out the blank but when Pride arise in our hearts we don't serve like we should saints of God something needs to change something needs to happen amongst us that takes us back to that genuine love that was once once had amongst the Believers the genuine care the genuine sincerity the the genuine servitude where we go out of our way to call somebody who we haven't seen in a while or whatever the issue may be I believe that we need to get back to basics now brother Branham tells this story and I'll share this with you and this will be my closing story brother Branham tells a story of one of his Hunting Buddies by the name of Bert and I'm sure you all know the story of Bert if you go listen to uh hear ye him for the Brandon probably preaches it 25 times and in each sermon he always mentions about bird here ye him is one of those uh sermons that I'm really into right now because it has everything to do with adoption and positionally being placed within the body and so as I was listening to this sermon the other day on the way to work brother Branham was talking about Bert and he said Bert was was a brutal man kind of evil had these little squinty eyes and everything and he would he would tell brother Branham he would say ah you're just a chicken-hearted preacher he would say Bert you're not gonna shoot that Little Fawn and and he would shoot them just on purpose just to uh to make brother Branham feel bad and so but he he enjoyed hunting with Bert for this reason because he was a good Hunter he said he never got lost he never had to go track him down you never had to worry about where he was and if he was going to say he was going to meet you at a certain place he would always be there brother Branham would have hated to hunt with me I am directionally challenged I'll get out in the woods and I'll see something and get so turned around Jesse will call me my father-in-law okay Stephen you need to Head East okay I need to go East yeah East Sun's right above me yeah East know your other East end up walking in circles but he enjoyed hunting with this guy and so there was hunting there one time and there was you know six inches of snow whatever it was on the ground and so what they would do is they would uh they would track the deer they would check track the footprints the hoof Prince whatever and so it was they he says oh we didn't get up there till late and this and that and we're eating our lunch and Bert pulls out this Little Fawn call brother Branham says oh Bert you're not surely you're not going to do that he says oh watch me he goes oh surely you won't do that but uh hell you chicken-hearted preacher you you know uh you know and this and that and one of brother Brandon's very good friends so he blows that thing 20 30 yards or whatever it was a popsus deer Mama dear wasn't a buck wasn't a little fun and here this mama deer comes out brother Bradham says I could see the brown and her deep brown eyes and she wasn't scared he says it wasn't normal for a deer to do this and he blew it again and she took a couple of walks towards the hunters and so here was Burton pulled his rifle up puts a shell in it and even with the click of the gun and all these different things had never caused that Mama deer to run off why was that because she thought that she had a fawn in distress that's what real mamas do real mamas whenever their kids are in distress guess what they're not ready to bounce but they're ready to stand there and take the punishment and so here he was he pulls his gun up and brother Branham said he turns away he says all any moment now I know his Scopes is on her his scope is on her and he's just gonna blow her heart out Plumb through the other side and he said I waited and I waited and I just kept thinking about that little old mama he says and all of a sudden I turned round and Bert said his gun in the ground and he started crying he says oh bill lead me to that Jesus that you keep telling me about and I begin to think about this story and I thought out of all the times that brother Branham had went hunting with this man no doubt he witnessed and no doubt he testified but there was there was nothing that brother Branham could say that would make him change his mind and change his heart but brother Branham said that Bert saw something real within that deer and it was something that he wanted it was something that he wanted so badly he didn't even know he wanted it until that point he saw something that was real within that Mama dear what was it it was love the Bible says that no greater love has a man than this then he lays down his life for he saw the love of that deer that she was willing to sacrifice her life in order to find her Fawn that was in distress it was something real that caught the attention of bird and it grasped his heart and when he seen it he knew that that's what brother Branham had amen my brother my sister that's what we need to go back to you not pointing the fingers not chastising not saying this that or the other but a genuine love of unadulterated Christian love sent from God that we would serve one another with a pure heart and sincerity and generosity that those around us could see and feel the love that we have for one another how do we get back to that through humility how do we get back to that by saying I'm sorry how do we get back to that when we see a need that we reach out and we meet the need as the musicians come he saw something that was real he saw something that was genuine and it's something that is missing within the ranks of the message a true genuine love for one another a true genuine of humility not Pride we've been walking in Pride for way too long with our nose noses stuck up in the air arguing over who's the best Church arguing over who's the best song leaders who's who's got this who's got that I guess guess what everybody sees it ah tit for tatin this for that and they said this and we'll say that and this person over here and that person over there this is happening and now there's contentions everywhere how do you think this makes the youth feel how does it make the youth feel amongst the churches when they see all the contentions that's going on amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ right now how does it make you feel [Music] it's the devil plain and simple bringing a division amongst people bringing a division amongst families bringing a division amongst churches divisions contentions fightings it's not Christianity it's not how we're supposed to serve one another if we don't agree hey that's okay as far as East ends from the West yeah but let's not be disagreeable one from with the other [Music] the reason that people are disagreeable is because of pride in our lives that raises up and says I'm right and it's causing contentions it's not good shouldn't be so brother Stephen what are we going to do about it somebody's got to do something about it [Music] so why can't we as a congregation lead by example when there's contentions all around and this one's saying this and this and that or whatever how about we just turn around and say you know what maybe I was wrong forgive me how about we instead of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and slap me I'll slap you how about we say hey go ahead I'll turn my cheek I'll hold my tongue because you're my brother we have the same father but it's got to start here otherwise where does it stop where does it stop as a congregation amongst each other and where does it stop as the body of Jesus Christ [Music] could I be so bold and say that it stops now that it stops right here and that the change starts right here and that the change starts right now that the change starts in my heart and then that it starts in your heart and the nonsense then stops the contentions come to an end and then we can really move on with God all of us as a body around the world the body of Jesus Christ we have one objective and that's to find the last soul [Music] to find them and to bring them into the body for them to take their place in their position within the body of Christ then the Rapture will happen but until that time they have a work to do until that time we need to get back to our foundational teachings of servitude [Music] servant is to serve when it's not convenient [Music] ah I have time I don't have time to reach out I don't have time to do this I don't know yeah make time there's some people are very good at it and others we're not so good how about we step up our standard I believe I do I believe if we can get rid of this Pride within assemblies and within ourselves and and if we can acknowledge it when we see it and apologize when it happens that God will really begin to move in your heart as an individual and in our services as a collective body [Music] and then Watch What Happens then we say the supernatural then we catch the moving of God then we see when God is dealing with hearts then we see we're not like Peter and rebuking them and saying Lord Lord stop no there's something spiritual going on and not only will we see it but will be a part of it but until that time we have to change Heavenly Father Lord thank you kind of cut up Norden everything but I prayed a little boy one time he he prayed and and Lord he was saying his ABCs and a little Jimmy Lord and and father he had faith that you would put the word the letters together to make words to understand what he was trying to say Lord may this sermon this morning we had Captivate our hearts Lord and made me realize father God it's an issue that we all deal with Lord every human being around the world but now that it's been exposed and everything Lord I
