[39:56] God bless you everyone
[40:01] a ritual in the name of our Lord and
[40:03] Savior Jesus Christ tonight
[40:04] [Music]
[40:07] are you here
[40:08] I greet you all in the name of our Lord
[40:11] and Savior Jesus Christ
[40:14] yeah
[40:16] it is a privilege to be in the house of
[40:19] the Lord
[40:22] to be once again in his presence
[40:25] foreign
[40:27] to be particular of disgrace
[40:31] what an amazing grace
[40:35] to have
[40:37] lay down his life for us
[40:40] to be this God
[40:43] who sees our path
[40:46] who knows what we have to go through
[40:50] at times we look around and we wonder
[40:54] why
[40:56] why me
[40:58] but he's the master of it all
[41:01] he has everything under his control
[41:05] and the more on a daily basis he reveals
[41:08] himself to us
[41:11] declare a division becomes
[41:14] the more precise we know how to work
[41:18] the more we know how to lean not unto
[41:21] our own understanding
[41:22] because our understanding is our
[41:25] greatest enemy
[41:27] because at times we wonder we think that
[41:30] our understanding is the way to go
[41:33] but this Amazing Grace despite of our
[41:36] understanding
[41:38] it comes down
[41:40] you reaches doubt
[41:42] he wants us to understand
[41:45] that he is in control
[41:47] amen
[41:50] while we are standing
[41:54] we'll take a quick reading of the
[41:57] scripture
[41:59] I believe the Lord knows how to lead the
[42:03] things around
[42:05] when we wonder
[42:07] how to go what to do how to proceed
[42:11] he is in control and we love it when
[42:14] he's in control
[42:17] but it's not always pleasant when we
[42:19] don't know
[42:21] it's not always Pleasant
[42:24] we'll take the book of Luke's chapter
[42:26] 22.
[42:32] verse 24.
[42:43] and there was also a strive among them
[42:46] meaning the disciples
[42:49] which of them should be accounted the
[42:52] greatest
[42:54] and he said unto them the kings of the
[42:56] Gentiles exercise lordship over them
[43:00] and they that exercise Authority upon
[43:03] them are called benefactors
[43:05] but ye shall not be so
[43:10] but he that is greatest among you
[43:13] let him be as the younger
[43:16] and he that is Chief
[43:18] has he that do serve
[43:21] shall we pray
[43:23] Heavenly Father
[43:25] surely that Grace
[43:28] this Amazing Grace
[43:31] has taken us from places where we were
[43:36] and leading us one step at a time to
[43:39] where we are to be father
[43:42] surely as we are guarded in thy house in
[43:46] thy presence
[43:47] in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[43:51] we desire a low father to hear from you
[43:55] because when Moses was lifted up in the
[43:58] mountain
[44:00] he was not just to go out there and
[44:02] leave people back there in the
[44:05] wilderness and unto themselves
[44:08] but it required him to go a little
[44:12] higher to be able to start seeing things
[44:14] that ought to be
[44:17] Almighty savior
[44:19] as we are getting into Thy word may you
[44:23] be with my mouth
[44:25] everything Lord that shall be said be
[44:29] unto your glory
[44:31] any place Lord that he could be my being
[44:36] may your father God remove
[44:39] and Lord be with the congregation my
[44:43] brothers and sisters
[44:45] you know their hearts you know their
[44:47] conditions you know everything they have
[44:50] need us
[44:51] may you attend unto them Father
[44:53] let Lord father God the word be
[44:55] receiving no heart
[44:59] we do not want to become the Greeks
[45:02] where we just sit and debate upon it and
[45:05] think of it Lord
[45:07] but Lord we need to be transformed
[45:09] little father
[45:11] and to become a new being
[45:13] yes as we as Lord with Thanksgiving in
[45:16] Jesus Christ's name amen you may be
[45:19] seated
[45:22] once again
[45:25] ritual in the mighty name of the Lord
[45:27] Jesus Christ
[45:29] it is uh
[45:31] a privilege for me to stand Among Us
[45:37] to be able to share what the Lord has in
[45:41] store for us on this day
[45:44] want to thank uh brother Run for the
[45:47] trust and the opportunity
[45:49] and all of you again who reached out a
[45:54] few days back to see me again and that
[46:01] was for me a little bit of a
[46:02] confirmation that the work must be done
[46:06] because at times when
[46:09] you have to preach and you're getting
[46:11] all these things left and right and you
[46:14] wonder if that will be beneficiary and
[46:18] but the Lord knows how to
[46:22] quieten us a little bit it's not always
[46:27] the church saying like Lord I need I
[46:30] need I need even the preachers
[46:31] themselves they go through the same
[46:34] process and and at times it's very
[46:37] painful and you don't know who to talk
[46:39] to at that time
[46:41] because you only have the Lord to assist
[46:44] you in that manner
[46:46] and hazy keeps assisting us he gives us
[46:51] one step at a time
[46:53] uh you know as human being we like to
[46:56] know everything like you know how it's
[46:58] gonna be and how I'm going to do this
[47:00] and figure out everything and
[47:03] and be at ease
[47:05] but then there won't be a civilization
[47:08] of faith
[47:10] then Faith wouldn't be wouldn't matter
[47:12] anymore but as he lays out his program
[47:16] it's just like you know here a little
[47:18] deal little and we get it and we get it
[47:21] and we might not even get it at times
[47:23] when he speaks to us you know like the
[47:25] children of uh Israel in the wilderness
[47:28] and to them was Thunders they didn't
[47:31] understand you heard the voice but it
[47:33] was thunderous it was painful in the
[47:34] ears like we can't hear such a things
[47:37] that's way too much for us to be handled
[47:39] you know you know that's for the pastors
[47:43] that's for the ministers you know but
[47:46] then the Lord himself knows that you
[47:48] know he had to have ministers around and
[47:51] to be able to take those Thunders and
[47:54] break it down low by low day by day
[47:57] uh even the ministers themselves before
[48:00] they stand on the pulpit you know they
[48:02] ever had a journey it's not an overnight
[48:04] element for them to stand up and preach
[48:08] those big elements so that the church
[48:10] expected times and stuff but the Lord
[48:13] Knows Why yeah everything is done the
[48:17] way down it's done uh we see here in the
[48:20] book of uh Luke chapter 22 the Lord
[48:24] Jesus himself having a congregation
[48:28] in his congregation we understand that
[48:31] he was the son of man revealed on that
[48:36] day and he came for a specific purpose
[48:38] but according to Luke 6 yeah he
[48:42] continued all night in prayer I went to
[48:47] select evangelize he evangelize and in
[48:52] the campaign he gathered a number of
[48:54] people and the people came the church
[48:56] the church started and people started
[48:59] coming and people were following
[49:01] different elements first pull second
[49:03] pull to pull all wonderful things he was
[49:06] so wonderful the church was good
[49:08] but then as he was working with them he
[49:11] knew exactly what the condition of the
[49:14] people were but then also among them you
[49:17] know quickly when you have a group of
[49:19] people people become clenished you know
[49:21] I get along better with this one and you
[49:24] know this is my friend I don't really
[49:26] like him you know he's always he's not
[49:30] really the type of people that I'll hang
[49:32] out with and stuff then they started
[49:35] they wanted to have a certain
[49:36] organization in the church
[49:39] so therefore it is said and there was
[49:41] also a Strife among them he was not an
[49:44] easy element why him he's supposed to be
[49:48] me I've been here longer I'm the oldest
[49:50] oh I'm the youngest you know this now
[49:53] the time of the young people you know
[49:54] with all the quotations in the message
[49:56] they were able to use and Jesus looked
[50:00] at them and said well
[50:02] that's good that you have all these
[50:06] elements before you you know all this
[50:09] criteria like you know this one has to
[50:12] be this and it says
[50:15] I know
[50:16] you are the Church of the Living God
[50:20] because I continued all night in prayer
[50:26] it was not just
[50:27] join a church
[50:30] go there and start preaching
[50:32] the son doeth nothing except he has sin
[50:35] done by the father
[50:37] to build the Wilder the Tabernacle in
[50:40] the wilderness Moses has to go up on the
[50:42] mountain and to be able to see the
[50:45] things that are to be
[50:46] the same way Jesus also continued all
[50:49] night to be able to bring out a church
[50:53] to be able to be the bread of Jesus
[50:55] Christ
[50:56] but then this church is in a condition
[50:58] this church is looking and wanting now
[51:01] to have status
[51:04] they want to be known with a certain
[51:06] name with a certain title you know I am
[51:09] this you know I'm the one who does this
[51:12] I'm the master accountant in the church
[51:14] you know brother Judah could be there
[51:16] you know oh you know I'm well spoken
[51:18] Peter could say because he has
[51:20] everything to say at all time
[51:24] you know
[51:25] he's very outspoken and you have John on
[51:29] his hand he's a very quiet man you know
[51:32] he's a lovely guy he doesn't speak as
[51:34] much
[51:35] you know so now there was a strive you
[51:38] know no we need a leader a leader who's
[51:40] quiet oh that that means you should be
[51:43] John
[51:44] no no no no no we need you know with the
[51:46] Pharisees and everything we need to have
[51:49] somebody who can speak that should be
[51:50] peter than there was a Strife among them
[51:55] and this happens also in the church this
[51:58] happens in the families this happens
[52:00] among the brothers and the siblings at
[52:03] home
[52:04] mommy is supposed to be mine he has to
[52:07] listen to me I'm the older brother
[52:11] the parent runs through every life
[52:16] and Jesus says he looks at them he
[52:19] understands them he said the kings of
[52:22] the Gentiles
[52:24] exercise lordship over them
[52:28] and they that exercise Authority upon
[52:31] them are called benefactors
[52:35] Jesus now is talking to them by
[52:39] condensing a lot of those things in that
[52:42] one sentence
[52:44] because when Jesus comes on the scene it
[52:47] was the reign of the Romans
[52:50] the land was governed by the Romans
[52:52] structured and everything
[52:54] but then where did the Gentiles came
[52:56] from
[52:57] why would Jesus turn around and speak
[53:01] about the Gentiles regarding the church
[53:04] who's only having strives among
[53:07] themselves
[53:10] because the spirit has to see what's
[53:13] going on in the church and has to know
[53:16] where that Spirit came from
[53:19] because it's easier to tell somebody
[53:21] dressed this way then you have to be
[53:24] this way but then Burnham said I stood
[53:27] there in the prayer line and discernment
[53:29] and attract the spirit
[53:33] by tracking the spirit he was able to
[53:36] know exactly where that stubbornness
[53:38] came from
[53:40] because at times the church the pastor
[53:43] is pulling the church to a certain level
[53:45] but then as long as certain elements are
[53:48] not addressed that church is not going
[53:51] anywhere
[53:53] and Jesus is dealing with the very same
[53:56] thing
[53:57] he's looking at them and said the
[53:59] Gentiles
[54:01] also do the same thing
[54:05] they also want to be structured like the
[54:07] Gentiles
[54:09] they want to have titles like the
[54:11] Gentiles
[54:12] and Jesus said
[54:14] ye shall not be so
[54:18] because you are called unto a certain
[54:21] purpose
[54:23] but then for them to be able to receive
[54:25] it they must have the revelation of what
[54:29] Jesus is saying and what is a revelation
[54:32] is just God giving us more information
[54:36] about the prophecy so we can better
[54:39] understand and better receive it
[54:43] because if we don't have more knowledge
[54:46] on the thing more information on the
[54:49] subject matter then it becomes hard why
[54:53] does the pastor only wants us to be this
[54:55] way why does are they doing this to me
[54:57] why has to be me because we understand
[55:00] quickly that the church or the believer
[55:04] is in a condition of lack of knowledge
[55:07] that's why the word said my people die
[55:09] because of what lack of knowledge
[55:13] it's not the knowledge of reading
[55:15] because today we have the message at the
[55:19] end of everyone
[55:22] but then the understanding by the spirit
[55:27] can only come to those that guided sin
[55:31] that will come through the messenger and
[55:34] the son of man reveal and under that
[55:37] umbrella then the Revelation comes to
[55:39] them
[55:41] because the Gentiles were there also in
[55:44] the time of Jesus like everybody else
[55:46] the Pharisees were there fewer people
[55:49] clean people nothing to reproach them
[55:52] but then this conversation is not made
[55:55] on a public stand but is made only to a
[55:59] specific group of people in a specific
[56:01] place and a Time
[56:05] the pattern of the gentle church or the
[56:09] Gentile nations in the end times
[56:12] we see that in the time that Jesus was
[56:15] talking we find that Jesus is referring
[56:18] them to the Gentiles
[56:20] but then the Gentiles came from
[56:22] somewhere Genesis 11 verse 1 and the
[56:26] whole earth was one language
[56:29] and of one speech and it came to pass
[56:33] that as the journey from the East that
[56:36] they found a plan in the land of China
[56:39] and they and they dwelt there and they
[56:42] say it one to another go to let us make
[56:45] brick and burn them throughly and they
[56:48] had brick for stone and slime and head
[56:51] and they uh they and they for murder
[56:54] and they say go to let us build a city
[56:59] and the tower whose top May uh would
[57:02] stop May reach unto heaven and let us
[57:05] make us a name
[57:08] the very same thing
[57:11] that the disciple was sitting there
[57:14] wanting also to become
[57:17] there were also people in Genesis 11 who
[57:20] also wanted to become that
[57:23] but then what did he do with doing that
[57:26] they didn't know that what we are doing
[57:29] is only leading us to a certain chaos
[57:34] but then to them it seems very nice to
[57:38] follow something like you know nice to
[57:40] embrace
[57:42] but then Jesus says ye shall not be like
[57:45] them but then for them to understand it
[57:48] it requires not to break it down to
[57:50] bring it into details for them to
[57:53] understand like you know watch the way
[57:55] you're going and look at where he's
[57:57] going to get you and then the church
[58:00] will have to make a choice because as I
[58:02] said there was also one among them who
[58:06] would also want to who was also going to
[58:09] make a choice
[58:10] Judas of either following what Jesus was
[58:14] going to say
[58:16] all going to choose his own ways because
[58:19] he also wanted to have himself make
[58:21] himself a name
[58:23] and Jesus now is pointing Us in the word
[58:26] he said that the Gentiles behave in a
[58:29] certain manner they say they join in the
[58:32] land they come into a certain area they
[58:35] say let us make a make us a name let
[58:38] less we discarded abroad upon the first
[58:41] of the the whole of the earth and the
[58:44] Lord came down to see the city and the
[58:48] Tower with the children of men build it
[58:52] the purpose in their heart
[58:55] they were able to sit down and agree
[58:58] that we are able to do this
[59:01] since we are able to do this it is not
[59:04] important for us to make us a name
[59:09] the Bible
[59:11] Church age
[59:13] Bible is the original name for Babylon
[59:16] it means confusion
[59:18] it was literally it was literally
[59:21] started by by Kush the son of a son of
[59:25] ham
[59:26] but was brought to a kingdom of power
[59:29] and Grandeur under his son Nimrod the
[59:32] mighty Hunter
[59:34] Nimrod according to the Genesis 11 which
[59:37] we just read our account and also
[59:40] according to the prophet history set out
[59:42] to accomplish three things
[59:45] while the church was sitting there
[59:48] was looking at it
[59:51] people of one language they can do
[59:53] anything
[59:55] people can agree just as in five six
[59:59] seven people let's do this let's make
[1:00:01] this happen
[1:00:03] and they wanted to have a name
[1:00:06] and they wanted to become structured in
[1:00:09] a certain manner
[1:00:10] and also then among them raises now a
[1:00:14] man from the line of ham
[1:00:16] who goes out now to start structuring
[1:00:20] the whole thing
[1:00:22] you started dividing the whole Nations
[1:00:26] this is the guy who goes to a city who
[1:00:31] thinks that he has the understanding
[1:00:34] then everybody else sets everything in
[1:00:38] place divides the people according to
[1:00:40] his understanding it started dividing
[1:00:44] the Earth what do you see nations in the
[1:00:47] Earth
[1:00:48] what do you see culture starts creeping
[1:00:51] in
[1:00:52] I am from the north you are from the
[1:00:54] south
[1:00:55] but then before that the Earth was of
[1:00:58] one language
[1:01:00] one speech everybody looked into it some
[1:01:03] Direction but then here now we have a
[1:01:06] man that thinks that he is well spoken
[1:01:10] he has the understanding of the earth
[1:01:13] and knows how to rule the people
[1:01:16] and why was he doing that it was because
[1:01:19] he had certain purpose
[1:01:23] to accomplish to attain without even the
[1:01:27] rest of the people realizing that he is
[1:01:30] following this year
[1:01:33] at times says
[1:01:36] watch that you do not become clenish in
[1:01:39] the church
[1:01:41] watch that you do not just cling
[1:01:44] yourself to a certain type of people
[1:01:47] because behind it then this one start
[1:01:50] influencing I'm the most prominent
[1:01:53] person here I'm the person that the
[1:01:56] people listen to the most quickly watch
[1:01:59] the pattern of the word
[1:02:02] quickly watch how those people starting
[1:02:05] to go
[1:02:06] quickly this is the person that will go
[1:02:09] into the houses and start convincing
[1:02:11] people he doesn't know how to preach he
[1:02:14] doesn't know how to do this he doesn't
[1:02:15] know how to do this let's leave the
[1:02:17] church and I'll just be preaching more
[1:02:19] Mysteries than he does
[1:02:23] he wanted to make himself a name
[1:02:26] he wanted to have a strong nation and
[1:02:29] how does it go about to make a strong
[1:02:31] Nation divide the people
[1:02:35] without them realizing that his is
[1:02:38] coming he talks to one brother then he
[1:02:41] turns around to the next brother then he
[1:02:43] tells him a different thing then when
[1:02:46] they bump heads then it's like no it's
[1:02:47] not me
[1:02:51] he's following a certain thing
[1:02:55] he is following a certain objective
[1:02:59] and Jesus is looking at the disciples
[1:03:03] he said that you have seen the you have
[1:03:06] seen eligible prophets in your day
[1:03:09] you have seen how the Pharisees and the
[1:03:13] Roman system have killed him
[1:03:17] and you're standing here
[1:03:19] and you also want to become again like
[1:03:22] the Gentiles
[1:03:23] don't you remember what happened with in
[1:03:26] the time of Solomon
[1:03:28] when the people rejected the the prophet
[1:03:31] and they wanted to become like the rest
[1:03:33] of the world
[1:03:37] people had forgot they started to forget
[1:03:40] what was what just happened a few months
[1:03:43] ago
[1:03:44] people just forgot what happens few
[1:03:46] centuries ago
[1:03:48] because
[1:03:50] somebody
[1:03:51] understood how men behave
[1:03:56] because somebody Nimrod understood on
[1:03:59] how to get to the people
[1:04:02] he said how am I going to get to them
[1:04:05] the word shows us that he wanted to
[1:04:08] build a strong Nation
[1:04:10] which he did he wanted to propagate his
[1:04:13] own religion which he did he wanted to
[1:04:16] make a name for himself which also he
[1:04:20] accomplished
[1:04:23] which shall also happen the same way
[1:04:28] but then the question is to what degree
[1:04:31] are you going to be partake of that
[1:04:33] project
[1:04:36] because we would say like you know the
[1:04:39] denominations they'll be out there it's
[1:04:40] like no Jesus is dealing with people
[1:04:43] under the umbrella of the message
[1:04:48] he's not dealing with uh with with with
[1:04:50] the Gentiles out there but they say like
[1:04:52] you know look at the parent
[1:04:55] of the Gentiles among you
[1:04:58] look at the ways creeping among you
[1:05:03] look at what style started to take place
[1:05:05] among you because actually my uh my
[1:05:09] title is uh
[1:05:13] the the super race and with the subject
[1:05:16] is the pattern of the of gentle nations
[1:05:18] in the end times
[1:05:20] the Lord is showing that I want to have
[1:05:24] a kingdom
[1:05:26] I want to have a people
[1:05:29] but then these people is in a certain
[1:05:31] condition
[1:05:33] and as the people are seated
[1:05:36] they think like you know let's just go
[1:05:38] to church
[1:05:39] let's just go attend church let's let us
[1:05:42] here is a good sermon today
[1:05:46] let us hey have an amen but they don't
[1:05:49] understand
[1:05:51] how to watch the environment
[1:05:54] they don't understand how important it
[1:05:57] is for them to watch what is the makeup
[1:06:01] because at times we are we are we um
[1:06:08] at times we we are partake of a certain
[1:06:11] makeup that puts us in a condition
[1:06:15] that we don't even say it
[1:06:18] but that condition drives us slowly but
[1:06:22] surely
[1:06:24] to do things that are contrary to the
[1:06:26] world
[1:06:28] because when Nimrod comes he doesn't
[1:06:31] tell you like you know I'm nimrod
[1:06:34] I have these three objectives that I'm
[1:06:37] going to do
[1:06:39] no
[1:06:41] very subtle
[1:06:43] very cunning
[1:06:45] how are you you're doing good
[1:06:49] oh Eve what is this
[1:06:52] I don't know
[1:06:55] but you know
[1:06:57] if I show you if you come to my church
[1:07:01] I'm going to teach you on how to use
[1:07:04] this
[1:07:06] really
[1:07:10] Pastor Adam never preached this
[1:07:15] this has never happened to us
[1:07:17] nobody has ever explained this to me
[1:07:21] it seems so naive
[1:07:25] it shows you the entire word
[1:07:28] to a certain extent
[1:07:33] you are already placed in the Heavenly
[1:07:36] places in Christ Jesus to be this
[1:07:40] but then the strive among the disciples
[1:07:42] is to have one greater among them which
[1:07:46] they were already aware
[1:07:50] if you do this you're going to become
[1:07:53] God
[1:07:55] wish they were already
[1:07:59] but they didn't have more information
[1:08:01] for them to understand who they were
[1:08:07] they didn't have the Revelation they
[1:08:10] will give them the Insight of what's
[1:08:12] going on
[1:08:14] to understand the makeup of the Garden
[1:08:17] of Eden
[1:08:19] yes there was prayer line you were a
[1:08:21] monkey you are lying you are this you
[1:08:23] deep speak tree and that but they did
[1:08:25] not know that there was another guy in
[1:08:29] the land with also another objective
[1:08:36] and that's important it goes about
[1:08:39] Indonesians
[1:08:41] dividing the land
[1:08:44] structuring the land
[1:08:46] calling this part here Shina
[1:08:49] calling this part here Nineveh
[1:08:52] calling this part here certain City
[1:08:56] why is it doing that
[1:08:59] he wants to build a strong Nation
[1:09:02] a better one than Michaels
[1:09:06] oh Michael doesn't know what he's doing
[1:09:09] he just has people wandering around the
[1:09:12] world and people just go up and down no
[1:09:15] I have to organize them
[1:09:18] let me organize them
[1:09:21] after being after being able to organize
[1:09:24] them
[1:09:25] then brings in the politics
[1:09:28] oh you know this one yeah you know
[1:09:32] actually like you know we are the almost
[1:09:34] a Sapient
[1:09:36] you know we are more intellectual
[1:09:39] Superior
[1:09:40] let's divide it even deeper you know
[1:09:44] 200 IQ 100
[1:09:48] what is it doing
[1:09:50] dividing the land
[1:09:52] make wanting to make a name for himself
[1:09:58] is going into people's lives
[1:10:01] oh you are short to you at all you are
[1:10:03] fat you are small
[1:10:06] it comes into the the society
[1:10:10] fat is not good
[1:10:12] you have to be slender
[1:10:15] Oh short is not good
[1:10:17] put some high heels
[1:10:20] what is it doing
[1:10:24] is structuring the land
[1:10:27] is dividing the land
[1:10:32] brother Burnham says
[1:10:34] watch
[1:10:35] where our sisters
[1:10:37] stand then you know where the church is
[1:10:40] at
[1:10:42] why because the pressure of society
[1:10:47] that Nimrod has brought about now pushes
[1:10:50] them now to conform to a certain element
[1:10:55] because them also by Nature since they
[1:10:58] lost Beauty
[1:11:00] they have to align with a certain thing
[1:11:03] and when they get trapped in the same
[1:11:06] web they also want to have also a name
[1:11:09] for themselves
[1:11:11] oh that's the sister that dresses this
[1:11:14] way
[1:11:16] that's the brother
[1:11:19] oh is the one that finances the church
[1:11:25] while he's doing that what is he doing
[1:11:27] only making a name for himself
[1:11:32] becoming more known better known in the
[1:11:36] church
[1:11:38] oh she's the most beautiful girl in the
[1:11:41] church
[1:11:43] name for himself
[1:11:46] Jesus said ye shall not be so
[1:11:51] because I want to prepare you a kingdom
[1:11:55] because in that Kingdom
[1:11:59] he that is beautiful
[1:12:02] be the servant of others
[1:12:06] you have the money be the servant of
[1:12:09] others
[1:12:11] but not here because the world is
[1:12:14] standing they want to have a name
[1:12:17] we like to be respected
[1:12:19] we don't like to be uh to be looked down
[1:12:22] at
[1:12:24] we like to be seen as somebody important
[1:12:30] amen
[1:12:32] because he knows
[1:12:34] he has a project
[1:12:37] because he knows I want to be worshiped
[1:12:41] I want when when I come in the church oh
[1:12:44] God bless
[1:12:46] or without you we don't know what this
[1:12:48] church will be
[1:12:50] you want to be worshiped and he shall be
[1:12:53] worshiped
[1:12:57] the word said that he shall do it
[1:13:01] and nothing we're going to preserve to
[1:13:04] prevent it
[1:13:06] the church is looking
[1:13:09] but they don't know what they're looking
[1:13:10] at
[1:13:12] they see somebody appearing what is the
[1:13:16] project of this guy
[1:13:19] where is the pastor leading the church
[1:13:21] to
[1:13:24] who is exalted in the church
[1:13:27] who is exalted in the house
[1:13:31] who is exalted in the society
[1:13:36] look at Society you want to have a name
[1:13:39] start undressing yourself
[1:13:43] start putting yourself out there you'll
[1:13:45] have a name
[1:13:49] you want to be regarded as a star
[1:13:52] start doing what Nimrod is telling you
[1:13:55] and you shall see you're going to get it
[1:13:59] That's What Judas should talk like you
[1:14:01] know hey I'll go you know make myself
[1:14:03] I'll get myself along with her the
[1:14:06] bigger people in the land the Pharisees
[1:14:08] and the sadly season be known among the
[1:14:12] among the Romans and things
[1:14:15] but the Lord says
[1:14:17] you shall not be so
[1:14:21] it is not easy to move now from Bad
[1:14:24] makeup from that environment that
[1:14:27] Society into a different Kingdom
[1:14:32] because the word shows us
[1:14:34] that when Nimrod went about
[1:14:38] he wanted to paint a picture
[1:14:42] that looks so innocent
[1:14:47] it has to look very innocent
[1:14:50] you know I'm not showing much you know
[1:14:53] it's just a little it's just not that
[1:14:56] tight
[1:14:58] very innocent the word says
[1:15:08] that this Niners is the Nimrod of the
[1:15:12] Bible we can confirm by by comparing
[1:15:14] history with the Gentile the Genesis
[1:15:16] account Pompeo said the nine is king of
[1:15:20] Assyria changed the ancient moderate
[1:15:24] ways of life by Desire by the desire for
[1:15:27] Conquest he was the first who carried
[1:15:31] war against his neighbors
[1:15:35] when it comes when it says woes
[1:15:39] you don't see somebody with the chores
[1:15:42] and with the guns and you're going to
[1:15:44] obey me no
[1:15:47] but with the tongue
[1:15:51] with the speech
[1:15:54] look at the first the first of the first
[1:15:56] seal it comes with a white West horse
[1:16:00] he's looking at people
[1:16:02] oh you are this okay yeah don't worry
[1:16:05] yeah we'll get to you yeah we'll see how
[1:16:08] you know don't worry like you know we
[1:16:10] are one people you know yeah this is
[1:16:12] like you know we are the Church of the
[1:16:14] Living God you know but behind it
[1:16:19] but behind it
[1:16:21] oh Church
[1:16:23] what day are we living in
[1:16:25] where we see that people are coming
[1:16:29] so humble
[1:16:32] so simple
[1:16:36] but yet a project behind it
[1:16:43] the word shows
[1:16:45] that as Nimrod comes into a land
[1:16:49] it starts to divide the people
[1:16:52] and when he divides the people
[1:16:55] is not doing it
[1:16:57] because he loves the people
[1:17:01] is not to set the people free
[1:17:05] is giving people knowledge that makes
[1:17:08] them think that now I am more
[1:17:11] independent
[1:17:14] but is only giving them those
[1:17:16] information to straight them slowly step
[1:17:21] by step
[1:17:23] slowly step by step
[1:17:27] what are we oh we are the Church of the
[1:17:30] Living God
[1:17:31] but he comes for war
[1:17:34] as it comes forward it stands around
[1:17:37] he looks at the church it divides the
[1:17:39] land it structures the people he
[1:17:42] introduces culture
[1:17:44] and the culture becomes now a way of
[1:17:47] living
[1:17:50] oh we we we from the north we love this
[1:17:53] type of food
[1:17:55] are we from the south we love this type
[1:17:58] of food
[1:18:01] the word shows that Nimrod comes
[1:18:05] it conquers the land
[1:18:08] it gives them a culture you bear with me
[1:18:10] as the Lord is leading me here
[1:18:15] it gets in among the people
[1:18:18] it shows them like you know hey
[1:18:20] the way you used to live
[1:18:23] it's of a lower class
[1:18:25] in other words now I'm going to make a
[1:18:29] civilization
[1:18:31] let me introduce civilization to you
[1:18:35] don't speak the language that you used
[1:18:37] to speak before
[1:18:39] because people under the Jehovah are one
[1:18:42] time
[1:18:44] they were peaceful
[1:18:46] you're coming in the church
[1:18:48] you find that people are peaceful
[1:18:51] people get along with each other Asbury
[1:18:53] Burnham shows us that there was a time
[1:18:56] that after service everybody will gather
[1:18:59] outside there with a pot of beans we all
[1:19:02] of us would eat
[1:19:04] but then as now civilization start
[1:19:07] coming in
[1:19:08] then they start telling you if you eat
[1:19:11] with somebody you don't know you can get
[1:19:13] a disease
[1:19:16] it's a fact
[1:19:18] that when you eat with something that
[1:19:20] you don't know you can get a disease
[1:19:23] but then the civilization of faith is
[1:19:26] slowly being removed among the people
[1:19:28] yet they can say it
[1:19:32] but quickly here now comes
[1:19:36] a way of living that is based on
[1:19:40] mistrust
[1:19:43] who is he
[1:19:45] where is he from
[1:19:47] oh we don't get along with them
[1:19:49] yeah we can have them Among Us
[1:19:52] but we are not part of them
[1:19:56] but look how slow how small did they
[1:19:59] start
[1:20:01] we don't even understand
[1:20:03] why when we see certain people
[1:20:07] quickly we close up
[1:20:10] we just close ourselves up why because
[1:20:14] the makeup of society
[1:20:17] accept the people over ones of one
[1:20:21] language
[1:20:22] on one speech
[1:20:24] to become now people of a certain tribe
[1:20:27] of a certain country of a certain state
[1:20:31] of a certain City
[1:20:34] of a certain group of a certain Church
[1:20:39] as from this church we don't go with
[1:20:43] people of that church
[1:20:46] and this was taking place in the church
[1:20:49] I'm not out there in the church
[1:20:52] and what were they doing it because they
[1:20:55] also wanted to make themselves a name
[1:20:58] amen
[1:20:59] and has the wanted to be known the
[1:21:02] biggest church in town
[1:21:05] the largest group of it all
[1:21:08] then Along Comes religion
[1:21:12] the interpretation of things
[1:21:15] we have the greatest revelation
[1:21:18] they don't have the revelation
[1:21:21] quickly
[1:21:23] the ministry among the people started
[1:21:26] dying out
[1:21:28] that's why even when Jesus sent the
[1:21:30] disciples out he said go
[1:21:34] pray for the sick and do everything they
[1:21:37] went out there they find somebody who
[1:21:39] was not part of them they said like you
[1:21:41] know we stopped them
[1:21:43] why because the Same Spirit of nimrod
[1:21:48] among the church Among The People Under
[1:21:52] the Umbrella of the message started
[1:21:54] dividing if without even them the people
[1:21:57] realizing that they were dividing they
[1:21:59] paid themselves
[1:22:02] Jesus was shaping now the church and
[1:22:05] said my beloved Brothers
[1:22:08] my beloved sisters
[1:22:10] understand where the source of your
[1:22:12] culture came from
[1:22:15] understand where the nationalities came
[1:22:18] from
[1:22:19] understand why do you have all these
[1:22:23] black white yellow green and all these
[1:22:27] things
[1:22:30] because said God created
[1:22:33] the men
[1:22:35] after his own image
[1:22:38] likeness
[1:22:41] then comes along the Romans
[1:22:44] the Roman came
[1:22:46] they said well
[1:22:48] we see what everybody else have done
[1:22:52] since
[1:22:53] they want to make everybody be equal
[1:22:56] let's give them that equality
[1:23:00] he gives them the equality
[1:23:03] they said everybody is equal before the
[1:23:06] word
[1:23:07] before the law
[1:23:09] everybody is equal you think they are
[1:23:12] but Obama say no
[1:23:15] it's just by words
[1:23:18] the source of it
[1:23:21] we need to become something
[1:23:23] and since some people have to be lower
[1:23:26] than others
[1:23:28] it is important for us
[1:23:30] to break them
[1:23:34] to have discrimination laws
[1:23:38] it's not necessarily said out there
[1:23:41] we will discriminate against these
[1:23:43] people
[1:23:45] but then they just tell you ah you know
[1:23:48] dear people
[1:23:50] they can do what they want to do
[1:23:52] but we can have them here Among Us
[1:23:58] I'm showing you what nimro that started
[1:24:02] in Genesis
[1:24:04] how it comes through the ages
[1:24:07] how it developed and how it gets into
[1:24:11] the church
[1:24:14] because once we don't say this
[1:24:18] we will have a church called The Church
[1:24:23] but without the power of the Living God
[1:24:27] because the God said that you are the
[1:24:30] kingdom of the Living God
[1:24:33] but that being the king in the kingdom
[1:24:36] of God
[1:24:37] is not the fact of saying like you know
[1:24:38] brother I love you
[1:24:40] brother come along no
[1:24:44] Jesus said you who are greater
[1:24:48] become the servant of those
[1:24:54] to become a servant
[1:24:57] it requires you now first to remove your
[1:25:00] status to put it on the side for you to
[1:25:03] become serving others
[1:25:07] and to serve others
[1:25:10] it is not an easy thing
[1:25:13] I work for you in this house and you
[1:25:15] don't respect me no you have to become a
[1:25:19] servant first
[1:25:23] because him the greater of them all came
[1:25:26] down to serve to lay down his life for a
[1:25:31] certain type of people
[1:25:34] but then when the same people who once
[1:25:38] was the greater in dividing and
[1:25:42] destroying Nations and changing cultures
[1:25:45] and and implementing new cultures be new
[1:25:49] ways and work generation and all kinds
[1:25:53] of things and lgbtq all these things
[1:25:57] is bringing these things around it's not
[1:26:01] to free the people
[1:26:04] because he wants to be worshiped
[1:26:10] and Along Comes religion oh the lgbtq
[1:26:14] the of the brothers like us
[1:26:17] let's accept them in the church
[1:26:19] let's not have discrimination oh you
[1:26:23] have to respect each other's uh a
[1:26:25] feeling sexual orientation
[1:26:28] but that didn't start that way
[1:26:32] it started like you know oh you people
[1:26:34] uh the way you living
[1:26:37] we have to we have to upgrade you you
[1:26:40] know go to school get the knowledge and
[1:26:43] become intellectual the more
[1:26:46] intellectual you are the more you
[1:26:48] understand life
[1:26:50] no
[1:26:52] the more intellectual you are the more
[1:26:54] confused you are
[1:27:00] the more confused you are
[1:27:03] sir what is a man uh
[1:27:06] but he has a PHD he doesn't know what a
[1:27:10] man he is
[1:27:13] he doesn't know what a woman is
[1:27:20] nimrod
[1:27:23] he had a purpose in his mind
[1:27:27] and this pardon of things started
[1:27:30] creeping in the church
[1:27:33] oh me I don't like this type of people
[1:27:35] you know we are in the message but you
[1:27:37] know really some people really you know
[1:27:39] really
[1:27:41] that's good
[1:27:44] I know ministers understand what I'm
[1:27:46] talking about
[1:27:49] they deal with certain things in the
[1:27:51] churches
[1:27:54] sister what's wrong it's like you know
[1:27:56] you know you know brother what's wrong
[1:27:58] you know you know you know
[1:28:01] you go behind it's the same spirit
[1:28:06] you follow behind it's the same spirit
[1:28:10] they might not say it
[1:28:14] but it's in them it's in the gene
[1:28:23] why they behave the way they behave
[1:28:26] brother Branham said the girl is so
[1:28:29] stubborn
[1:28:30] she doesn't understand why she's
[1:28:31] stubborn
[1:28:33] she doesn't even think that she's wrong
[1:28:36] she doesn't even understand why she like
[1:28:39] to wear high heels nevertheless
[1:28:42] they preach him they preacher the
[1:28:44] preacher the preacher but she doesn't
[1:28:46] just there's no place in her
[1:28:49] to receive that word
[1:28:53] what is that who started it not her
[1:28:56] father not her grandfather not her
[1:28:58] ancestor but nimrod
[1:29:03] in 1953 as they discovered on how to how
[1:29:06] to make the the makeup people's makeup
[1:29:09] they can know like you know you from
[1:29:10] North Africa you you are a mixture of
[1:29:13] yourself in East and left and right and
[1:29:16] all these things people people are the
[1:29:19] result of the mixture and they don't
[1:29:22] understand a level of stubbornness a
[1:29:25] level of a lack of humility to the world
[1:29:27] because something came from somewhere
[1:29:31] and the word is a showing now to the
[1:29:35] people to the church and say watch where
[1:29:38] that came from
[1:29:39] he said he came from the Gentiles where
[1:29:42] did the Gentiles took it from from
[1:29:44] Nimrod where Nimrod took it from from
[1:29:46] his father sir the serpent where did the
[1:29:49] serpent take it from the angel of Light
[1:29:52] out there in heaven because he wanted to
[1:29:55] be worshiped
[1:29:56] it came from somewhere
[1:30:01] and once you see it in the church
[1:30:05] then the Lord has said this has to be
[1:30:07] addressed
[1:30:09] Jesus said ye shall not be so
[1:30:12] understand what you're going through
[1:30:16] I understand you make up yourself
[1:30:19] Lord who am I
[1:30:22] because Lord changed me change me change
[1:30:25] me yeah but what I'm saying as long as
[1:30:27] there's this unconfessing somewhere
[1:30:30] that devil has the rightful place to
[1:30:33] stay there
[1:30:38] the brother is so blessed they say yes
[1:30:41] it's not him it's the father he served
[1:30:44] the Lord the Lord didn't have time to
[1:30:46] bless the father that's why now he comes
[1:30:49] to the child
[1:30:51] so there's also the devil he understood
[1:30:54] it crosses seed with the woman
[1:30:58] then comes he comes along
[1:31:01] to the extent where we see Isaac and
[1:31:03] Rebecca two faithful child children
[1:31:07] two wonderful Christians but then out of
[1:31:10] it comes
[1:31:11] somebody
[1:31:13] where did he come from
[1:31:15] what did Abraham do
[1:31:18] was it Abraham or was it Sarah
[1:31:24] who carried that Jinn to be able to be
[1:31:27] found in a a a ISO
[1:31:32] the pardon
[1:31:34] these things striking into the church
[1:31:38] breaking people apart
[1:31:40] without even understanding
[1:31:45] he wanted to propagate his own religion
[1:31:48] says
[1:31:51] but the most revealing of of all is that
[1:31:55] which set forth the the trinitarian
[1:31:57] concept of God in in Trion form one uh
[1:32:01] the head of an old man symbolizing God
[1:32:04] the Father a circle of of which in the
[1:32:07] Mysteries that signify seed which turns
[1:32:10] which in turn means the Sun the wings
[1:32:13] they tell and the dove was the doctrine
[1:32:16] of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:32:18] three person in the godhead they were
[1:32:20] the the veritable Trinity you can see
[1:32:24] the same thing in Rome
[1:32:28] now let me let me ask once again is it
[1:32:32] not strange that the devil and his
[1:32:35] worshipers listen to this is it not
[1:32:39] strange that the devil in his worshipers
[1:32:41] actually had more truth revealed than
[1:32:45] the father of Faith Abraham and his
[1:32:48] descendant it is not strange that the
[1:32:51] worshipers of Satan knew more about God
[1:32:54] than the children of God
[1:33:00] religion
[1:33:03] to be able to get more to the people
[1:33:06] just as he did in the Garden of Eden
[1:33:10] it takes the same word
[1:33:12] it brings another interpretation to it
[1:33:15] to bring the people to worship to him
[1:33:17] right nevertheless
[1:33:20] in Rome we see that when the Roman came
[1:33:24] they stood around
[1:33:26] they saw the word come to them
[1:33:29] they did not take it as the word
[1:33:32] quickly Define themselves in the
[1:33:34] position of
[1:33:36] no
[1:33:39] it just can't be one man alone
[1:33:42] all of us can interpret the word
[1:33:45] in the way we think
[1:33:48] because that makes us equal
[1:33:51] through religion
[1:33:52] through the word
[1:33:54] ah brother I don't really think like you
[1:33:56] know this is really bad
[1:33:59] I don't really think like you know
[1:34:01] brother Branham really meant that
[1:34:04] I don't really think like you know
[1:34:05] brother Branham really understood what
[1:34:07] he was talking about
[1:34:10] I don't really think like you know this
[1:34:11] year is bad
[1:34:13] but watch that
[1:34:16] slowly but surely they're going they're
[1:34:19] going they're going because when Nimrod
[1:34:22] started
[1:34:23] you started like you know hey you know
[1:34:25] God the father he doesn't really you
[1:34:28] know talk to God have you heard from God
[1:34:30] I've been praying like you know I don't
[1:34:33] get no answer like you know I don't know
[1:34:35] what's going on let some I know it's
[1:34:38] like no don't do that ignore him as much
[1:34:42] as possible brother Branham say ignore
[1:34:44] him all together
[1:34:47] in other words it doesn't exist
[1:34:51] the one that exists is what you see
[1:34:56] that means I can worship the tree yeah
[1:34:59] you can worship the tree why because you
[1:35:01] can see the tree gives you the fruit
[1:35:04] that you eat
[1:35:05] you gotta think it
[1:35:11] don't you see it's the job when you go
[1:35:14] to school you go you get your your job
[1:35:17] you get money you have to give yourself
[1:35:20] more to your job than anything else
[1:35:27] it was so simple
[1:35:28] it was not something like you know very
[1:35:31] strange and very big and very mysterious
[1:35:34] like you know oh now come and start
[1:35:36] worshiping me no no
[1:35:39] very simple
[1:35:42] who wouldn't want to have a job here
[1:35:46] we need to have a job
[1:35:49] but then that same job started taking
[1:35:53] you slowly but surely away from what
[1:35:57] you're supposed to worship then you
[1:35:59] start worshiping your job
[1:36:02] then you start spending more time with
[1:36:04] your job then you start taking more time
[1:36:07] and you don't find the importance of
[1:36:10] going to church
[1:36:12] because when you seek the money from
[1:36:15] your job will pay for your insurance
[1:36:18] because the money from your job will
[1:36:20] make you pay for your clothing
[1:36:23] why am I going to pray
[1:36:27] why am I going to go to church what is
[1:36:29] the pastor going to cancel me when I
[1:36:31] have a philosophy out there who has
[1:36:34] experience of marriage counseling and
[1:36:37] all these things
[1:36:38] box why am I going to sit here and
[1:36:41] listen to a man who always wants to do
[1:36:44] things in his own way
[1:36:48] Jesus says I'm preparing you a kingdom
[1:36:53] I'm preparing you a kingdom
[1:36:55] it's not this one here that you're
[1:36:57] looking at
[1:36:59] and through the Gentiles Nations all
[1:37:02] over the world
[1:37:04] you see the same thing
[1:37:07] let it be in Africa
[1:37:10] not even America
[1:37:12] Let It Be Asia everywhere you go you see
[1:37:16] this impression the people
[1:37:19] Nimrod is pulling
[1:37:21] you need to worship me
[1:37:23] you need to worship me but it comes in a
[1:37:27] very humble
[1:37:28] simple
[1:37:30] way
[1:37:31] you look at it
[1:37:33] it seems very factual
[1:37:36] according to the research you get this
[1:37:39] degree you'll make so much money
[1:37:42] but the same degree doesn't tell you
[1:37:45] like you know that job
[1:37:47] takes you away from your place
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:51] because God has a place for you
[1:37:54] a kingdom for you
[1:37:57] and that's him all this here the devil
[1:38:00] is going to bring it surely but surely
[1:38:03] to a place where people will worship it
[1:38:07] and people will love it so much
[1:38:11] people will go to places say oh I am I
[1:38:14] am so grateful I still love and leave
[1:38:18] I'll look at these people oh my God they
[1:38:21] really don't have clothing oh my job I
[1:38:25] really love my boss oh my boss you
[1:38:28] really give me this night job oh you
[1:38:31] give me over time
[1:38:35] I am telling you the worship of nimrod
[1:38:38] does not strike to the eye
[1:38:43] he will show up to work every single day
[1:38:46] but he won't be able to make two service
[1:38:49] a week
[1:38:54] you understand where the devil is taking
[1:38:56] the church
[1:38:58] that's not happening all day it's
[1:39:00] happening Among Us
[1:39:02] and while it's happening Among Us now it
[1:39:05] requires now Jesus to come along and see
[1:39:08] The Strife among the people I need to
[1:39:11] get a job I need to be this I need to be
[1:39:14] this I need to be respected I need to
[1:39:16] have a name
[1:39:18] you understand the language among people
[1:39:21] you know what's going on in the land you
[1:39:23] know what's going on in the church
[1:39:29] I I am a young woman
[1:39:32] everybody does it what's wrong with it
[1:39:38] because she wants to be known
[1:39:41] she wants to have a say in the house
[1:39:44] but she doesn't understand what is the
[1:39:48] other Kingdom yet
[1:39:50] she's only exposed he or she is only
[1:39:53] exposed to this Kingdom
[1:39:56] and that's the only thing that comes
[1:39:58] faster than anything else
[1:40:00] the child is crying just take the iPad
[1:40:03] give him start worshiping
[1:40:07] is watching is watching is watching
[1:40:11] but then in those cartoons
[1:40:14] it's shaping the mind of the child
[1:40:18] it's shaping the mind of the people
[1:40:21] the watching all type of things brother
[1:40:24] he
[1:40:25] eat nothing there's nothing to it
[1:40:28] yes there's nothing to it
[1:40:31] but your subconscious
[1:40:33] is taking those things and it starts
[1:40:36] shaping you where your behavior
[1:40:39] to the point you see a woman dressing
[1:40:42] correctly you you find it indecent for
[1:40:44] you you'll find it indecent
[1:40:48] for you to be in prayer and be in church
[1:40:51] and be among the brothers and God of in
[1:40:54] fellowship with the brothers and
[1:40:56] studying the word it becomes strange to
[1:40:58] you
[1:40:59] I have this project that I have to work
[1:41:01] on you know it's going to give me so
[1:41:04] much money you know like you know
[1:41:06] actually you know with their website out
[1:41:09] there they are telling us about what
[1:41:11] brother really did this and
[1:41:15] foreign
[1:41:29] and the pastor also let this type of
[1:41:32] people on the pulpit
[1:41:35] brother Branham did mistakes these
[1:41:38] mistakes now we are now in the time
[1:41:41] where ourselves now we are able now we
[1:41:44] are equal we can talk to God
[1:41:47] oh okay okay
[1:41:50] until you get in the word you start
[1:41:53] understanding the other Kingdom the
[1:41:56] administration of that Kingdom
[1:41:59] to know who is God
[1:42:02] who is a prophet who is the what is the
[1:42:05] body of Jesus Christ
[1:42:07] until then
[1:42:09] I just just for tonight just to show you
[1:42:14] what Nimrod is doing
[1:42:16] how is coming so close
[1:42:19] how is gotten so deep in the church
[1:42:23] I have to work I have to work so hard
[1:42:25] for my family
[1:42:28] harder you working
[1:42:30] and watch the children at home
[1:42:34] what's what's going on at home
[1:42:38] she's a he or she five years old yeah
[1:42:41] you know they're just doing this but
[1:42:43] then until when they get about 12 years
[1:42:45] old and they bring a boy at home hey
[1:42:48] Daddy hey this is my boyfriend then
[1:42:50] you'll become serious
[1:42:54] because the makeup of the child is not
[1:42:58] the makeup of the word because there was
[1:43:00] nobody at home to teach the child to
[1:43:03] teach the church about the things that
[1:43:05] are happening
[1:43:09] the child that has experience of exp of
[1:43:11] worshiping Nimrod for 12 years therefore
[1:43:14] everything he knows it's uh the
[1:43:16] Kardashians Beyonce Lil diss a little
[1:43:19] that this guy and you know that
[1:43:23] that star of the movies all those things
[1:43:26] that's what the child knows
[1:43:33] the Bible is this a long time ago this
[1:43:36] is this this is a new age now
[1:43:39] this is 2023 now brother you know you
[1:43:42] know we we the people now
[1:43:47] do you see where Nimrod is going
[1:43:51] do you see what Jesus was talking about
[1:43:54] he said ye shall not be so
[1:43:58] if we shall not be this what we showed
[1:44:01] then what shall we be
[1:44:06] because if he has shown us like you know
[1:44:09] look at how they're coming about us
[1:44:12] how Nimrod wants to be worshiped and the
[1:44:15] Bible the word says he did it
[1:44:18] shall do it again
[1:44:22] but then the question is
[1:44:24] are you going to be partake of that
[1:44:26] project
[1:44:29] on which part are you going to stand it
[1:44:35] because at times our makeup
[1:44:38] where we came from
[1:44:42] we have all these things in our back
[1:44:44] Minds that we don't even understand we
[1:44:46] ask
[1:44:47] that leads us to behaving a certain way
[1:44:52] that surely slowly but surely takes us
[1:44:56] there stubbornness and all these things
[1:44:58] I can cover all everything because time
[1:45:00] is up
[1:45:03] because we can go in and even see how
[1:45:06] God brought uh the prophet Ezekiel
[1:45:09] and to start to show how people got
[1:45:12] there
[1:45:14] the stages that they went through for
[1:45:18] them to become dead
[1:45:19] to the point they started worshiping
[1:45:21] tamils
[1:45:23] and tamus in other places they call him
[1:45:26] damn who's
[1:45:28] and them who's is what they used to
[1:45:30] worship the god of fertility
[1:45:35] and this God of fertility took the
[1:45:38] people to a certain extent where even
[1:45:41] with the songs they were singing
[1:45:46] brother Branham says
[1:45:50] treat her
[1:45:52] like your sister
[1:45:57] I believe the grown-ups can understand
[1:45:58] my language
[1:46:08] kind of languages
[1:46:09] all kind of things
[1:46:13] we are married brother we are married we
[1:46:15] are we are this brother we are this one
[1:46:19] I'm talking in the church
[1:46:22] because talking to the church
[1:46:26] showing what's taking place in the
[1:46:28] church
[1:46:29] God took Ezekiel to show him what was
[1:46:32] taking place in the church
[1:46:39] Nimrod wants to be worshiped
[1:46:43] brother said he shall be with
[1:46:46] but Jesus said ye shall not be so
[1:46:51] then there's also a place for us to get
[1:46:55] to
[1:46:57] because also this Nimrod with whatever
[1:47:01] he is doing there's a end for it
[1:47:05] and but believe by God's grace if the
[1:47:07] Lord gives us is still if we're still
[1:47:09] alive we're going to get into those
[1:47:11] places
[1:47:12] for us to be able to see what is taking
[1:47:16] place Among Us
[1:47:18] where we are to set our mind
[1:47:21] because you say it's an amazing grace
[1:47:24] that the Lord comes to us and gives us
[1:47:28] this element for us to be able to see
[1:47:31] them
[1:47:32] because he's only talking to a group of
[1:47:35] people
[1:47:36] not everybody out there because sermons
[1:47:39] like this out there you get canceled
[1:47:42] thank you
[1:47:45] you can cancel pretty quickly it's
[1:47:47] Freedom we need Freedom we need Freedom
[1:47:49] you you don't don't don't be controlling
[1:47:53] me don't tell me what to do
[1:47:58] but Jesus was telling the disciples what
[1:48:00] to do
[1:48:03] so did it requires
[1:48:05] in availability from each one of us
[1:48:08] to be able to receive
[1:48:12] to look back into our lives not just
[1:48:15] confessing
[1:48:16] but to understand our makeup
[1:48:19] why are we the way we are
[1:48:22] where we behave the way we behave why is
[1:48:25] it so hard for us just when I see a
[1:48:28] situation I have a certain anxiety
[1:48:30] coming up
[1:48:31] but you've believed the message
[1:48:36] amen
[1:48:38] I believe that but God's grace and I
[1:48:42] couldn't really get much but by God's
[1:48:44] grace and will be able to see
[1:48:46] everything's that that will be able to
[1:48:49] follow how these are wonderful things
[1:48:52] and and I said loading
[1:48:56] foreign
[1:49:07] I'll just read the last quotation then
[1:49:09] I'll close
[1:49:11] the six-fold purpose of Gabrielle visit
[1:49:13] to Daniel
[1:49:15] 130 113. now remember
[1:49:18] when we get in the seals that Antichrist
[1:49:21] writes out over this those seals Daniel
[1:49:24] spoke of it here the prince that would
[1:49:27] come
[1:49:28] he would be cut off Jesus would would to
[1:49:32] make reconciliation for the people but
[1:49:34] that Prince that would stand up that
[1:49:38] would cause the Abomination to to make
[1:49:42] desolation that was Rome through Titus
[1:49:46] and this time
[1:49:48] it's a prince coming out of Rome will do
[1:49:52] it and he will be revealed in the last
[1:49:56] day now listen making himself God
[1:50:03] going to do
[1:50:09] word says that is going to happen
[1:50:13] be of be assured that is going to happen
[1:50:17] but then at the same time Jesus says
[1:50:20] ye shall not be so
[1:50:22] What a Wonderful Grace we have
[1:50:25] to be able to hear certain things that
[1:50:29] will help us understand
[1:50:31] so we do not be stumbled like you know
[1:50:33] oh I don't like this I don't like that
[1:50:36] no it's not about you liking or you not
[1:50:38] liking
[1:50:40] it's about you knowing and you making
[1:50:43] the choice
[1:50:45] shall we pray
[1:50:47] Heavenly Father
[1:50:49] I am personally so grateful Lord that
[1:50:53] the way you brought out these things
[1:50:56] not much Lord as much was in the notes
[1:51:00] but we believe
[1:51:02] that you know how to attend unto your
[1:51:05] children the way you know what's going
[1:51:09] on in their lives father
[1:51:10] as we're looking away unto you we
[1:51:13] believe that you will
[1:51:16] bring these things loaded to our
[1:51:18] remembrance
[1:51:19] to be able to understand ourselves Lord
[1:51:23] because Lord when Ruth came into the
[1:51:26] land she said thy people shall be my
[1:51:28] people
[1:51:29] we also want to become that father
[1:51:33] to be partaker of that Kingdom
[1:51:36] but the required obedience to everything
[1:51:39] that Naomi said father
[1:51:41] as we understand through the word that
[1:51:44] is going to become
[1:51:46] and is going to make himself God
[1:51:50] father
[1:51:51] I commit myself your children into thy
[1:51:54] hands
[1:51:56] Lord remember us we are weak but our
[1:52:00] strong
[1:52:01] we also know that at times we can stand
[1:52:04] and we can look at the situation we
[1:52:06] think we can handle it
[1:52:08] but the kindness lord of the devil
[1:52:11] is so far beyond Lord
[1:52:16] help us along the way as we look away
[1:52:20] with Thanksgiving and
[1:52:22] we ask and we pray
[1:52:25] if there's anything further that was not
[1:52:27] said according to Thy Word
[1:52:30] forgive me Father
[1:52:32] if love father God I had stumbled or
[1:52:35] said something Lord that may have hurt
[1:52:38] your children
[1:52:39] forgive us Lord
[1:52:41] but Lord let your father God
[1:52:44] what you wanted to express to your
[1:52:46] children to see this pattern
[1:52:49] of nimrod
[1:52:51] throughout the entire land
[1:52:54] may you love me will of Father God be
[1:52:56] away father
[1:52:58] because more Revelation makes us Lord
[1:53:00] aware
[1:53:01] of what's going on
[1:53:04] we commit all these things in Jesus
[1:53:06] Christ's name
[1:53:08] amen
[1:53:09] may God bless you
[1:53:12] to live
[1:53:15] the
[1:53:16] way
[1:53:18] he wants me to live
[1:53:24] I want to give
[1:53:27] I
[1:53:28] until there's yes no more
[1:53:34] to give
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:43] there's just no more love for I could
[1:53:50] never
[1:53:51] ever ever
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:53:59] amen
[1:54:00] what I enjoy about Ministries
[1:54:04] that God places within the church is
[1:54:07] they have certain viewpoints
[1:54:10] they look at it from this angle and from
[1:54:13] that angle
[1:54:14] God's got Apostles prophets evangelists
[1:54:17] pastors teachers and each one of them
[1:54:20] are a very special gift to the church
[1:54:22] can we say Amen
[1:54:26] and what I enjoy is a man that goes into
[1:54:29] the word and sees a pattern
[1:54:32] as it was so shall it be
[1:54:36] and he says when you see those fighting
[1:54:39] among you of the Gentiles that want to
[1:54:42] be great
[1:54:43] it shall not be so among you
[1:54:48] and he says if you want to be great
[1:54:50] learn to be a servant
[1:54:53] God teach us the Way Up Is Down
[1:54:56] [Music]
[1:54:59] we're not here to build our own kingdom
[1:55:01] we're to here to get out of this Kingdom
[1:55:05] into another kingdom a whole nother
[1:55:07] realm Jesus said my kingdom is not
[1:55:11] of this world huh
[1:55:14] I love it he said Nimrod comes in and
[1:55:17] and introduces culture
[1:55:22] culture which one of us can say well it
[1:55:26] is my culture and my country we do it
[1:55:29] this way
[1:55:31] so then we can bring our culture right
[1:55:33] into the message and we defile the
[1:55:37] message
[1:55:39] because it's no longer pure it is the
[1:55:42] American culture as an example
[1:55:45] American culture that when we have a
[1:55:48] marriage
[1:55:50] they go ahead and drink and they have
[1:55:53] the music and they have the dancing
[1:55:55] because that's it every culture in
[1:55:59] America that that's what it's become
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:02] and the women dress horrible and
[1:56:05] everybody drinks and they have that and
[1:56:07] it's a big party
[1:56:09] that's culture
[1:56:11] since when do we allow that culture then
[1:56:13] to come into our message
[1:56:17] we're Christians
[1:56:20] civilization and culture and all of this
[1:56:24] stuff
[1:56:25] thank God thank God we had a prophet
[1:56:30] that would bring us away from culture
[1:56:33] away from civilization
[1:56:37] now I'll tell you that quote that was
[1:56:40] read the worshipers of Satan
[1:56:42] no huh
[1:56:44] know more about God
[1:56:47] than the children of God now how just
[1:56:51] think on that for just a moment
[1:56:53] because of intellect
[1:56:57] and reasoning because that's the channel
[1:57:01] Satan used for Eve
[1:57:04] he got her to stop long enough don't you
[1:57:07] want to be like God
[1:57:11] he used the channel of reasoning and
[1:57:14] intellect
[1:57:15] and he sowed a seed and a cultural seed
[1:57:18] a civilization seed
[1:57:22] well I never heard Adam speak like that
[1:57:25] do you see what I'm seeing that was very
[1:57:27] good
[1:57:29] um
[1:57:32] and then he ends it there which one of
[1:57:36] you want to be a part of nimrod's
[1:57:39] project
[1:57:40] [Music]
[1:57:43] all right Lord let me be part of your
[1:57:46] project
[1:57:47] God you are building a masterpiece
[1:57:54] huh
[1:57:56] and God the great sculptor is now
[1:57:59] finishing the masterpiece
[1:58:01] but brother Branham said once that
[1:58:04] Masterpiece when Michelangelo got that
[1:58:07] that that Masterpiece so like the image
[1:58:11] he saw in his vision
[1:58:14] that he stood back and he took the
[1:58:16] Mallet and he's he hid it on the knee
[1:58:19] and he says speak
[1:58:21] because the vision
[1:58:24] and the sculpture the Masterpiece had
[1:58:27] become one
[1:58:29] but brother Branham said the flaw
[1:58:33] the flaw is what made it the masterpiece
[1:58:37] I want you to understand the flaw that
[1:58:39] you have
[1:58:40] as a human being
[1:58:43] yet God can sit there and make you into
[1:58:46] the very image he wants you to be and
[1:58:49] yet you got a flaw
[1:58:52] think of that
[1:58:55] and that's he's telling the ones that
[1:58:58] have the flaw to speak
[1:59:02] let that
[1:59:04] settle and chew on that for tonight as
[1:59:07] you go to bed say God I don't want to be
[1:59:10] a part of this project of nimrod
[1:59:13] God I don't want to be a a modern day
[1:59:16] Church
[1:59:17] I want to see the identified Christ all
[1:59:20] down Through the Ages
[1:59:22] I want to be a part of the old-time
[1:59:25] religion
[1:59:26] I don't want to be a part of this
[1:59:28] culture of all of this and and knowledge
[1:59:31] and all of that I want to I I want my
[1:59:34] knowledge to come from him amen let's
[1:59:37] Stand Together God bless you I enjoyed
[1:59:39] that I want to say I enjoyed that yep

[1:59:50] so I think I have him scheduled June the
[1:59:53] 7th it's a Wednesday night so he'll
[1:59:55] continue on that I'm sure but you see
[1:59:58] now the thing that I enjoy about it
[2:00:00] brother martin
[2:00:01] I'm not trying to mold you
[2:00:04] to preach a certain way
[2:00:07] God's called you to preach a certain way
[2:00:10] you preach it as the way God leads you
[2:00:13] amen and that's what I tell with all of
[2:00:16] our Ministries that God has got here I'm
[2:00:19] not trying to uh americanize an African
[2:00:25] do you understand and I'm not trying to
[2:00:27] uh

[2:00:34] brother Bram said now watch when when
[2:00:36] that bride from every country
[2:00:39] when she began to March
[2:00:43] huh she had a certain dress because they
[2:00:47] came from wherever they had their
[2:00:50] National Guard
[2:00:52] okay but what were they marching to
[2:00:55] the rhythm of the word
[2:01:00] the pattern of the word you can have a
[2:01:04] cultural dress
[2:01:06] according to let's say a certain
[2:01:10] National Garb but it is the word of God
[2:01:13] that makes it holy
