[32:29] Daniel
[32:31] 4 and if my voice it sounds a little
[32:33] funny they're trying to tweak the the
[32:35] microphon so they're going to try to get
[32:37] that worked
[32:40] out Daniel 4:3 and it says how great is
[32:44] are his signs and how Mighty are his
[32:46] wonders his kingdom is an everlasting
[32:49] Kingdom and his Dominion is from
[32:51] generation to
[32:54] generation and one more verse in
[32:56] Deuteronomy
[32:59] 7 Deuteronomy 7 and verse 6 and he's
[33:04] talking to the children of Israel here
[33:05] and he says for thou art a holy people
[33:08] unto the Lord thy God and the Lord thy
[33:11] God hath chosen thee to be a special
[33:13] people unto
[33:14] himself above all people that are upon
[33:17] the face of the Earth the Lord did not
[33:20] set his love upon you nor choose you
[33:22] because you were more in number than any
[33:25] other people for ye were fewer of all
[33:29] people but because the Lord loved
[33:33] you because the Lord loved you and
[33:36] because he would keep the oath which he
[33:38] had sworn unto your
[33:43] fathers and ha the Lord brought you out
[33:45] of this Mighty hand and redeemed you out
[33:48] of the house of the bondman and from the
[33:50] hand of pharaoh king of Egypt know the
[33:54] there the that the Lord thy God he is
[33:56] God God the faithful God which keepeth
[34:00] the Covenant and mercy with them that
[34:02] love him and keep his Commandments to a
[34:05] thousand
[34:07] Generations you see why are you a
[34:09] special people it's not because you know
[34:12] there's other churches that gather on a
[34:14] Wednesday night there's other people
[34:16] that Gather in a building but why are
[34:18] you a special people unto him because he
[34:21] chose you it's has nothing to do with
[34:24] your choosing you didn't choose him but
[34:26] God chose you right and he's keeping an
[34:29] oath that he has with your
[34:33] father you can be seated this
[34:40] evening he is a faithful God and one
[34:43] that keeps his Covenant and his Mercy
[34:46] forever and tonight if we can take a
[34:48] title of God in his
[34:50] Generations God in his generations and I
[34:53] I don't want to talk about the the
[34:55] generations or the
[34:58] age the age as a whole but I want to go
[35:02] down the the way of we know that we are
[35:04] the final generation we are the final
[35:07] voice Amen to this age but God deals
[35:10] with Generations within a generation
[35:13] amen so you have many generations that
[35:16] have come down through time but as we
[35:19] sit here this evening there's many
[35:21] generations amongst us that I can say as
[35:25] I we sit here that I you know my
[35:27] grandfather is here and then you have my
[35:29] dad and myself and my son so you have
[35:31] four generations within a
[35:33] generation and God deals with all those
[35:37] Generations yes sir and I was reading in
[35:39] the church age and I was just kind of
[35:41] going through and it says in the the the
[35:45] thyrian church age I might go to a
[35:49] handheld I might go to a handheld
[35:53] good I'm going to go with white oh my
[35:56] it's kind kind of bothering me so if
[35:59] that's all
[36:10] right test all right can you hear me all
[36:14] right yeah that feedback was kind of
[36:16] bothering me
[36:18] so all right praise the Lord amen so as
[36:21] I begin to to to just read in the in the
[36:24] in the church ages and I begin to go
[36:26] through and and in in the uh thyrian
[36:29] Church age well it's Revelations 2:9 it
[36:31] says I Know Thy works and charity and
[36:34] service and faith and thy patience and
[36:37] thy works and the last shall be the last
[36:40] to be more than the first and I begin to
[36:43] think that this might be true to every
[36:44] single age that as we go on and time
[36:47] goes on that the last is going to be
[36:49] more and it's going to be greater than
[36:51] the first that thy service and thy love
[36:54] and everything that theyy do thy faith
[36:56] and thy patience will be more than what
[36:58] it started out as why is that because as
[37:01] the word continues as the word goes on
[37:04] it's going to become greater and it's
[37:06] going to become become more clearer to
[37:08] the bride right and so we see that you
[37:12] will have greater love and greater
[37:14] service and greater Faith because the
[37:17] bigger the problem the bigger the
[37:20] problem listen God is going to match
[37:22] that problem the bigger the trial the
[37:25] bigger the blessing the bigger the faith
[37:27] you need the bigger the sickness the
[37:29] greater the sickness the greater that
[37:31] healing is going to
[37:34] be and we understand the age that we're
[37:36] living in and why in this last age the
[37:39] last will be greater why as we get
[37:41] closer to the coming of Lord why will it
[37:44] be greater because it's a restoration
[37:47] age it's a restoring back age it's
[37:50] bringing everything back to the original
[37:53] right for we know that that's why
[37:55] Malachi 4 was sent was to restore the
[37:58] faith would restore us back that restore
[38:01] the fathers to the sons and the sons to
[38:03] the
[38:05] Fathers as we read in Psalms 4 that one
[38:08] generation shall praise thy Works to
[38:10] another and shall deare thy Mighty acts
[38:15] and we read here in the generation the
[38:18] word generation means the succession or
[38:21] series of persons from the same
[38:24] stock a series of persons from the the
[38:26] same stock now if we look at this we
[38:29] know that naturally in our in our human
[38:32] uh
[38:33] makeup we are not made up of the same
[38:36] stock we come from different cultures
[38:39] different backgrounds different
[38:40] ethnicities all these different things
[38:43] and most of us we would never have
[38:45] anything in
[38:47] common most of us wouldn't even Gather
[38:50] in the same place because we wouldn't
[38:51] have that much in common but there's one
[38:53] thing that we have in common is that we
[38:56] have the same same heavenly father that
[38:58] we have the same father that had made us
[39:01] and he has that bloodline that runs
[39:03] within
[39:04] us
[39:05] amen and so if we look naturally we have
[39:08] nothing in common but spiritually we are
[39:11] made up from the same stock we come from
[39:13] the same bloodline and it's a it's a
[39:16] something that people now are looking
[39:19] into their
[39:21] ancestors they're so interested on where
[39:23] they came from you can go and get an
[39:25] ancestor test you can take a DNA test
[39:28] and you can find out different things
[39:30] about your makeup y why is it people
[39:33] want to find out where they come from
[39:36] it's human nature
[39:38] amen you want to know where you came
[39:43] from you want to know what the makeup is
[39:45] why what makes me the way I
[39:48] am why am why am I the way I am right
[39:53] because when you begin to look back you
[39:55] can begin to see see things in the past
[39:58] things in your your relatives sometimes
[40:00] you know you might be like your granddad
[40:02] or your uncle or you might look like
[40:04] your uncle or you might look like your
[40:06] aunt or you might look like this person
[40:08] why because it's back in the
[40:11] ancestors you begin to look farther back
[40:14] because people want to know where they
[40:16] came from because it's the same thing
[40:18] spiritually when you know where you came
[40:20] from you know where you're
[40:22] going you can identify a problem if
[40:25] there is a problem
[40:32] right you see we I begin to as I was
[40:37] just going through the church ages and I
[40:40] begin to think that many times that we
[40:43] are living on
[40:45] blessings and Promises of past
[40:50] Generations living on blessings and
[40:53] Promises of past Generations I'm not
[40:56] talking about Generations we can read in
[40:58] the Bible and you can go through the
[41:00] history of the Bible and you can see
[41:02] from generation to generation you can
[41:04] see that transition but I'm talking
[41:06] within your own
[41:08] family that you're living on a blessing
[41:11] because your granddad belied this
[41:13] message and he took God at his word he
[41:16] began to believe it and serve God and
[41:18] make commitments and do things for God
[41:20] and you're living on that
[41:25] blessing
[41:27] yeah you see men within this building
[41:31] you can look at Elders brother
[41:34] Bobby my
[41:36] granddad for the men of different ones
[41:40] men's of
[41:42] history that have walked in this message
[41:44] for many years and yet they're still
[41:46] waving the banner of Jesus Christ High
[41:48] abut that they're still carrying this
[41:50] message that they're still yeah they may
[41:52] think that they're in retirement and
[41:54] that they they don't have a posted the
[41:56] duty and all these things but yet
[41:57] they're great in the economy of
[42:00] God true that many of them sit there and
[42:03] study in the message and in the message
[42:05] all day long why because they have the
[42:07] time to do
[42:09] it amen maybe we're reaping the benefits
[42:12] of them studying and being constantly in
[42:14] the word
[42:20] true how blessed we should be as a body
[42:22] when we see that yes yeah
[42:27] and how that we can be recipients of
[42:29] those
[42:29] blessings and how important it is for
[42:32] each generation to continue to pass on
[42:36] that
[42:37] inspiration on let us read in Matthew 1
[42:40] and one I want to read the book of the
[42:43] generations of Jesus
[42:46] Christ and I begin to see something
[42:49] here in Matthew 1:1 the book of the
[42:52] generations of Jesus Christ the son of
[42:54] David the son of Abraham and Abraham
[42:56] begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and
[42:59] Jacob begat Judas and his Brethren and
[43:02] Judas begat farz and uh Zara of Tamar
[43:08] and z uh farz begat esam and esam begat
[43:13] arum and solom begat Boaz of
[43:17] Ray Racha or
[43:21] Rahab and Boaz begat OED of Ruth and OED
[43:25] begat Jesse and Jesse begat David and
[43:29] the king and David the king begat
[43:32] Solomon of er that had been the wife of
[43:36] uas a't that
[43:38] something that whenever you read that
[43:40] you see a
[43:42] people one that God would come down
[43:46] through and David here that King David
[43:50] would take one and he begat Solomon
[43:53] through another woman that was the wife
[43:56] of
[43:57] uas people of mistakes people of failure
[44:00] of imperfect
[44:02] people and yet he's doing the same thing
[44:05] today you look at your lineage and where
[44:07] you come from of imperfect people but
[44:11] yet God is bringing through an imperfect
[44:13] people to a perfect promise because as
[44:17] we continue to read here because uh and
[44:20] Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary
[44:23] of whom was born
[44:26] Jesus who was called
[44:28] Christ so all the generations from
[44:31] Abraham to David are 14 generations and
[44:34] from David unto the carrying away into
[44:36] Babylon our 14 generations and from the
[44:39] carrying away into Babylon unto Christ
[44:42] Our 14
[44:44] Generations now the birth of Jesus
[44:46] Christ was on the wise when as his
[44:49] mother Mary was espouse to Joseph before
[44:51] they came together she was found with
[44:54] child of the Holy Ghost
[44:56] then Joseph her husband being a just man
[44:59] not willing to make her a public example
[45:02] was minded to put her away
[45:05] privy but while he thought on these
[45:07] things behold the angel of the Lord
[45:09] appeared unto him saying Joseph thou son
[45:12] of
[45:13] David thou son of David and I read did
[45:17] we not just read that
[45:20] Jacob Jacob begat
[45:23] Joseph but yet you see when God makes a
[45:26] calling he's not calling based upon who
[45:29] your father is amen but he's calling
[45:32] upon the Royal
[45:34] lineage do you understand that God is
[45:36] calling him thou son of David it's a
[45:39] Royal bloodline that he's calling him
[45:44] from fear not to take Mary unto thee thy
[45:49] wife for that which is conceived of her
[45:51] is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring
[45:54] forth a son and thou sh shall call his
[45:56] name Jesus and he shall save his people
[45:59] from their sins now all this was done
[46:02] what was done down through lineage God
[46:04] watched over this seed God watched over
[46:08] a one down through a
[46:10] lineage and he came to a spot to where a
[46:14] man and a woman had to take him at his
[46:17] word that it wasn't birth upon an
[46:21] act it wasn't birthed upon an
[46:24] act
[46:27] let me ask
[46:28] you brother Nick if Bethany came to you
[46:32] you guys are engaged and she and she
[46:34] came to you and she said I am a child of
[46:37] the Holy
[46:39] Ghost that's a tough
[46:41] ask that's a tough ask and us as a
[46:45] congregation how would we take that oh
[46:48] yeah right that's hard to
[46:51] believe listen they're not some great
[46:53] men with some understanding and all
[46:55] they're more moral people just like you
[46:56] and I but yet they had to take God at
[47:00] his word so God did all of this he
[47:02] brought it down to a to to two people
[47:06] that would take him at his
[47:08] word that the woman would say be it unto
[47:11] me according to your word and the man
[47:14] would take that
[47:16] honor knowing that it wasn't his
[47:19] child but would bring Mary into his wife
[47:22] to be his
[47:24] wife
[47:26] now he did all that that it might
[47:28] fulfill that which is spoken by the Lord
[47:32] by the prophet saying Behold a virgin
[47:33] shall be with child and shall bring
[47:35] forth a son and they shall call his name
[47:37] Emanuel being interpreted god with
[47:41] us so down through time imperfect people
[47:45] to a man and a
[47:46] woman that had to take God at his
[47:49] word yes because God is going to bring
[47:52] his word to
[47:54] pass right
[47:57] listen Joseph had to believe it so much
[47:59] that God called him to be the husband of
[48:02] Mary but he never called him to be the
[48:04] father of Jo uh of Jesus
[48:08] right you understand because he couldn't
[48:11] be his father
[48:13] because he already had a father he was
[48:15] conceived of the Holy
[48:18] Ghost so he called was called to be a
[48:21] father or called to be a husband right
[48:25] but not to be that father listen because
[48:27] brother brandham says that he the Bible
[48:28] had to correct
[48:33] itself in Luke let's read it Luke
[48:37] 2 and
[48:42] 41 now his parents went into Jerusalem
[48:45] every year at the Feast of the Passover
[48:47] and when he was 12 years old they went
[48:49] up into Jerusalem after the custom of
[48:50] the feast and when they had fulfilled
[48:53] the days they returned and the Child
[48:55] Jesus jesus carried behind in Jerusalem
[48:58] and Joseph and his mother knew not of it
[49:00] but they supposedly to have been in the
[49:03] company when a Day's Journey and when
[49:05] they sought him among their kin folk and
[49:09] acquaintances listen you're not going to
[49:12] find him there you're not going to find
[49:14] him amongst that those kin folk or
[49:17] amongst those K those
[49:19] acquaintances why because those aren't
[49:22] his kin folk right those aren't his
[49:25] people
[49:27] right those aren't his people those
[49:29] aren't his kin folk it's just like you
[49:31] and I why do you go to Family reunions
[49:33] and you don't fit in and people don't
[49:35] understand you your co-workers your
[49:37] acquaintances they don't understand why
[49:39] you go to church two days a week they
[49:42] don't understand why you don't cuss they
[49:44] don't understand all these different
[49:46] things why you put an emphasis on church
[49:48] more than things of the world true amen
[49:51] they don't understand it
[49:54] why
[49:56] why don't they understand it listen you
[49:59] they won't find you in those
[50:02] places because that ain't your kin folk
[50:05] you're of a Heavenly Kingdom you're of a
[50:08] Heavenly
[50:10] people
[50:14] Amen in verse 45 and when they found him
[50:17] not they turned back again into
[50:19] Jerusalem in verse 48 to save time and
[50:22] when they saw him they were amazed and
[50:24] his mother said unto to him son why hast
[50:26] thou thus dealt with us and behold thy
[50:31] father and I have sought thee in
[50:34] Sorrowing and he said unto them how is
[50:37] it that the ye has sought
[50:39] me wi ye not that I must be about my
[50:42] father's
[50:46] business and it says and they understood
[50:48] him not the not the sayings that he
[50:50] spake unto them why didn't he understand
[50:53] them why didn't they understand
[50:56] his father was a carpenter he should
[50:57] have been out doing carpenter work and
[50:59] hanging out and being with the kin folk
[51:02] but yet he said I'm not I'm about my
[51:04] father's
[51:05] business I'm about my father's business
[51:09] what are you doing this evening coming
[51:11] to church yes what are you doing on and
[51:15] the world doesn't understand right but
[51:18] you're about your father's
[51:20] business that's why I say I come into
[51:22] the house of God and I say God I want
[51:25] you to teach me your ways teach me your
[51:27] statutes yes Lead Me Oh God in thy ways
[51:30] yes amen show me your path put me into
[51:33] your perfect will because if we're not
[51:35] in his perfect will we're in the
[51:37] permissive
[51:43] will I want to be about my father's
[51:46] business yes listen I understand that we
[51:50] must go about our daily lives and we
[51:52] must provide for our families and you
[51:54] know it's not not just
[51:57] about naturally our family going about
[52:00] our daily
[52:02] lives listen that's your business but
[52:05] there's a time to be about God's
[52:07] business very good right it's okay
[52:10] sometimes that you got to go to work and
[52:12] you got to go to school that's your
[52:13] business that's things that we must take
[52:15] care of in our flesh but then there's a
[52:18] time and a place that you must be about
[52:19] your father's business because there's
[52:22] coming a time and the hour is late that
[52:24] if you don't redeem the time amen if you
[52:26] don't redeem the time that you're in
[52:29] amen you won't know what to do when the
[52:32] father comes you won't know what to do
[52:34] when the father when God ask you have
[52:36] you been about my business what is that
[52:40] I don't know on I've been playing around
[52:43] when I was a child I spake as a child
[52:46] and I did childish things but whenever I
[52:48] became a man I put away those things
[52:50] yeah why because you became about your
[52:53] father's business very good amen MH
[52:58] amen there's a difference between your
[53:00] business and the father's business yeah
[53:03] yes in the Easter seal he says how can I
[53:06] deny the
[53:07] mother that gave birth to me how can I
[53:10] deny the father that is his own blood is
[53:13] in me how can I deny Charles brandham
[53:17] from being my father I could not do it
[53:19] I'm willing to stand his reproach or
[53:22] anything because I am his son yeah isn't
[53:26] that something and we know who his
[53:28] father is he was a junker he was a
[53:31] bootlegger and he said I'm willing to
[53:34] take his reproach why because you can't
[53:37] deny who your father is that's right you
[53:39] only have one mother one father you
[53:41] can't deny who that who birthed you who
[53:43] raised you you can't deny that very
[53:46] father or
[53:49] mother amen because you can't choose who
[53:52] your parents are you can't choose who
[53:55] your family is right you don't get a
[53:57] choice in the age that you grew up
[54:00] in you don't have a choice in that you
[54:03] don't have a choice whether you were
[54:05] raised in in a in a family of three or a
[54:08] family of
[54:09] eight you don't have a choice that's
[54:12] right you don't have a choice whether
[54:14] you were rich or poor
[54:16] right you don't have a choice as a kid
[54:21] amen listen I was blessed as a kid to
[54:23] have good parents good father good
[54:26] mother amen grew up in a small town amen
[54:30] and yet we grew up in a 1500 foot house
[54:33] seven of us five
[54:36] kids five kids shared one
[54:38] bathroom oh my some of you are too
[54:46] spoiled five of us shared one
[54:49] bathroom 15 or 1700 square ft it's tight
[54:54] yeah
[54:55] listen I never had my own bedroom till I
[54:57] was a senior in high
[54:59] school I always shared with my older
[55:01] brother until he moved out and then I
[55:02] got my own
[55:05] room but you see I was blessed because I
[55:08] had a father and a mother and as long as
[55:10] the family was there listen I didn't
[55:13] think any diff anything different that
[55:15] was just the way of life so we don't
[55:17] have a choice in the matters right right
[55:20] we don't have a choice in our natural
[55:22] father
[55:24] amen
[55:28] but let me say this it's what you do
[55:30] with that
[55:31] choosing that God places you in very
[55:34] good it's what you do with that choosing
[55:36] when God places you in a spot in a
[55:39] family in a church it's your choice and
[55:42] what you do with that yeah very good
[55:45] on we look at the the prophet's example
[55:48] he says you
[55:50] know that he was willing to take the
[55:52] reproach of his parents because you
[55:54] cannot deny your father or your mother
[55:57] but then he began to as you go through
[56:00] his ministry and you you see that he
[56:02] caught a
[56:04] revelation because he said these are my
[56:06] parents I cannot deny them but then he
[56:09] also said that I'm not the son of Ella
[56:12] and Charles
[56:14] brandham
[56:15] why because when you catch a revelation
[56:19] yeah in the power to transform he says
[56:22] now there are many things in talking
[56:24] about my natural birth there are many
[56:26] things in my natural birth that I cannot
[56:28] brag on I'll tell you I ain't got
[56:32] nothing to brag on my mother was a
[56:33] sinner to begin with my father was a
[56:36] sinner and they come out of a bunch of
[56:39] Cutthroats and gunfighters and most of
[56:40] them died with their boots on drunks and
[56:43] bootleggers and everything else out of
[56:45] Kentucky my mother a half Indian and
[56:47] I've got nothing to brag on I can't brag
[56:50] on my family
[56:51] tree you know many of us could say the
[56:53] same
[56:57] he says but glory to God there's one
[56:59] thing I can brag on now it's my second
[57:03] birth which comes from Jesus Christ I
[57:05] can brag on that parent that we have yes
[57:09] sir for he is my father he is my savior
[57:12] he is my redeemer I can brag on
[57:14] everything that he's
[57:16] done he has done for me because now I
[57:20] become his son I am no more a son of
[57:22] Charles brand am I a son of Jesus Christ
[57:24] that's right I can brag on my birth now
[57:27] I can't brag on my first birth there's
[57:29] nothing I'm ashamed of that I'm not
[57:31] ashamed of my second birth no no I'm not
[57:34] ashamed of that second birth how did he
[57:36] do it by the washing of the water of the
[57:38] word truly predestinated believer stay
[57:41] with the word they won't pervert it it
[57:44] can't be
[57:46] perverted each one of us can say the
[57:48] same that we might not be able to brag
[57:51] on our natural
[57:53] birth our natural ual father hey every
[57:56] father even me being a young father you
[57:58] make plenty of
[58:00] mistakes and I'm sure I will make more
[58:02] of mistakes and many times the devil
[58:05] wants to beat dads down because you know
[58:07] what you didn't do it good enough your
[58:09] sons begin to struggle and they begin to
[58:10] have a hard time and you should have
[58:12] done this and you should have done
[58:18] that but yet we see here what birth are
[58:22] you looking
[58:23] at what birth are you looking at as I
[58:27] said naturally we come from different
[58:28] raisings different
[58:32] backgrounds and the raising of your
[58:34] father will do two of one thing or one
[58:36] of two things maybe
[58:39] three if he's a good dad it'll inspire
[58:43] you to be the half the man he
[58:46] was and if he's a bad one and he's not
[58:48] the greatest example you will do
[58:51] everything to not be like him amen
[58:55] if your dad never gave you anything he
[58:57] never he he never told you he loved you
[58:59] and all these different
[59:01] things you will tell your kid I love you
[59:03] all the time you'll give them everything
[59:06] but you must be
[59:07] careful you must be careful because if
[59:10] your dad didn't show you that love and
[59:12] then you give your kid everything and
[59:13] you're giving them and giving them and
[59:15] giving them you're going to make him a
[59:16] spoiled
[59:17] brat true yes and so we see that the
[59:21] raising of our fathers then con
[59:24] condition us or make us who we are and
[59:26] the third thing was that if you're not
[59:28] careful you'll become him if it's
[59:32] someone that's having a hard time or
[59:34] he's not the greatest examples you'll
[59:36] use an excuse to become the very man he
[59:39] is y y you'll use them as an
[59:44] excuse amen you might say that my great
[59:47] great grandfather or my grandfather or
[59:49] my father was this way and it's a trait
[59:52] that's been passed down from generation
[59:54] to generation within our family but I
[59:57] say that it's time to break that cycle
[59:59] it's time to break that chain that
[1:00:01] you're so easily saying that you know
[1:00:03] what it was my dad or this Dad or my
[1:00:04] grandfather or this trait hey it's time
[1:00:07] to get rid of
[1:00:08] that true amen yes amen your dad might
[1:00:14] have a tendency of whatever it may be of
[1:00:16] selfworth or not fitting in or you know
[1:00:19] a commitment to church whatever it may
[1:00:21] be but don't let that excuse be your
[1:00:23] excuse amen
[1:00:28] yes
[1:00:30] sir every generation if I could say it
[1:00:34] this way and you understand that a
[1:00:35] generation starts with you amen there is
[1:00:39] Generations before you but then there's
[1:00:41] also Generations after you exactly
[1:00:43] that's
[1:00:45] good brother Brandon would tell a story
[1:00:47] if I can remember it correctly that he
[1:00:49] there was a man and he was
[1:00:52] going it was during the winter time and
[1:00:54] there was snow on the ground and it was
[1:00:56] during the holiday season and him
[1:01:08] and holiday
[1:01:10] drinks he began to walk down the road
[1:01:13] and as he was going I believe it was
[1:01:16] they crossed the park or something like
[1:01:17] that and his son he noticed he looked
[1:01:19] back and his son was going back and
[1:01:21] forth he said Son why you why you going
[1:01:24] back and forth like that he said Daddy
[1:01:25] I'm just going in your
[1:01:31] footsteps Daddy I'm just walking in your
[1:01:35] footsteps let me ask you what kind of
[1:01:37] footsteps you leaving
[1:01:39] behind what kind of footsteps are you
[1:01:41] leaving
[1:01:44] behind yes it's a tough question it's a
[1:01:47] good question to Pricks our hearts
[1:01:51] huh because we all have a choice Amen to
[1:01:55] be an example and I know I'm talking to
[1:01:58] the fathers but it goes for every single
[1:02:00] one of us tonight whether we be a father
[1:02:02] a mother a Christian a young person yes
[1:02:06] sir whatever it may
[1:02:07] [Music]
[1:02:08] be listen brother brandham says he says
[1:02:12] you are today what you are you are today
[1:02:15] what you are because several years ago
[1:02:17] you chose what you are
[1:02:19] now and what you choose now will
[1:02:22] determine what you will be in 5 years
[1:02:24] from
[1:02:25] today 5 years from today you may be a
[1:02:28] missionary or uh 5 years from today you
[1:02:31] may be a renowned Christian or 5 years
[1:02:33] from today you may be in hell because
[1:02:35] you chose or you made the wrong
[1:02:38] decision and he uses two examples of
[1:02:42] being a prostitute but I want to bring
[1:02:43] it closer to
[1:02:45] home because sometimes 5 years from
[1:02:48] today you may be fighting for your kids
[1:02:52] because you didn't think Wednesday
[1:02:53] nights were that important important
[1:02:55] on you may be fighting for your kids
[1:02:58] because you didn't think youth group was
[1:03:00] important right you may be having a hard
[1:03:04] time your family might be falling apart
[1:03:06] because there was not a priority set on
[1:03:08] Church yes on listen we all have a
[1:03:12] choice yeah that's all I'm getting at is
[1:03:15] that we have a choice from today yeah
[1:03:17] the history is the history but the
[1:03:19] future is what you make of
[1:03:21] it you can't change the past but you can
[1:03:24] change the
[1:03:26] future based on the decisions that you
[1:03:29] make from
[1:03:34] today he says or you may be a man or a
[1:03:37] woman that's a credit to any society
[1:03:39] because you chose your choice for Christ
[1:03:42] 5 years from today he may be in glory
[1:03:44] gone in the Rapture because you made the
[1:03:46] choice today but you got to choose and
[1:03:50] don't look at what you see choose what
[1:03:52] you see by faith that's the only thing
[1:03:55] that will count is what you choose by
[1:03:59] faith choose by faith sir don't go by
[1:04:03] feeling don't go by emotion don't go
[1:04:06] because if you go off of the feeling of
[1:04:08] it and not by faith most of us we won't
[1:04:11] feel like going to church on a Wednesday
[1:04:13] night that's
[1:04:14] right it true listen I feel it too
[1:04:18] sometimes work is long days are long the
[1:04:21] kids are
[1:04:23] sick some sometimes things just aren't
[1:04:25] going right but that's the time to get
[1:04:28] to church that's the time to put the
[1:04:30] faith into action that I don't feel like
[1:04:32] going but my faith is telling me because
[1:04:35] if you allow your intellectual if you
[1:04:37] allow your intellect and your feelings
[1:04:39] and everything to control you it'll fool
[1:04:42] you but that's why he's telling you go
[1:04:45] off of Faith because it's the faith in
[1:04:48] you that's calling you you know what I
[1:04:50] need to go I need to be there I need to
[1:04:52] take a step of Faith because when you
[1:04:54] you take a step of Faith that's when God
[1:04:55] takes a step toward
[1:04:57] you amen
[1:05:01] amen not based on feeling or
[1:05:04] intellect but the choices you make
[1:05:07] today yes are the results of Tomorrow
[1:05:13] y you see you are either influencing or
[1:05:16] being influenced by those around
[1:05:19] you and I'm not talking about just the
[1:05:22] young people we can so easily put this
[1:05:24] about the the crowd of your young people
[1:05:26] and say that which is very
[1:05:29] true that who you hang around that's who
[1:05:31] you become true but let me take it from
[1:05:34] the youngest to the
[1:05:36] oldest it's true take it from the
[1:05:39] youngest to the oldest who are you
[1:05:41] influencing and how are you influencing
[1:05:44] what influence do you have on your
[1:05:47] children what influences are we putting
[1:05:50] on the Next
[1:05:51] Generation because I believe sometimes
[1:05:53] we we get in a place and I've seen it
[1:05:56] that you you know you've been in the
[1:05:57] message for so long it could be 25 years
[1:06:00] plus whatever it is and you begin to
[1:06:02] serve God and you begin to serve God and
[1:06:04] you begin to sit back and say you know
[1:06:06] what I'm just going to let that
[1:06:07] generation handle it I put in my time be
[1:06:10] careful be careful don't relax too much
[1:06:14] we're still in a battle we're still in a
[1:06:15] fight because there's younger
[1:06:17] Generations looking up at you that are
[1:06:19] in your 40s and 50s and seeing what are
[1:06:21] you doing with this message
[1:06:24] right is that fire still burning as
[1:06:26] bright and in more then now as it was
[1:06:31] then because I love to see it I love to
[1:06:35] ask questions from
[1:06:36] Elders I love to see it amen I love to
[1:06:40] ask him
[1:06:41] questions because there's a lot of miles
[1:06:43] under that road there's a lot of history
[1:06:46] there's a lot of trials that we might
[1:06:48] not have to go through if you ask him a
[1:06:52] question very good
[1:06:55] and you might say well I'm a young
[1:06:57] couple and I don't have kids and I'm
[1:06:59] just a young
[1:07:01] person yet our Bible gives us an example
[1:07:03] of choices made by our parents and it's
[1:07:06] reflected into the Next Generation and I
[1:07:08] was reading it to save time and it's in
[1:07:11] Hebrews 7 go back and read it Hebrews 7
[1:07:16] and I I found this little quote that
[1:07:18] brother brand says cuz he summarizes it
[1:07:20] and he talks about it's a great event
[1:07:22] that was taking place with Abraham that
[1:07:24] he had paid tithes to MDC and when he
[1:07:27] when he was returning from the slaughter
[1:07:28] of the Kings and now he said that Levi
[1:07:31] was in his loins of Abraham when he met
[1:07:35] MDC coming from the slaughter of the
[1:07:37] Kings and he reckoned that Levi paying
[1:07:39] tithes also when he was in those loins
[1:07:43] his great great
[1:07:47] grandfather you can't tell me what you
[1:07:49] do today is important for future
[1:07:51] Generations exactly that while he was in
[1:07:54] the loins that Abraham was paying ties
[1:07:56] to mzc and while Levi was in the loins
[1:07:59] of Abraham
[1:08:02] Generations within Abraham he was paying
[1:08:05] ties to
[1:08:06] him go read it in Hebrews
[1:08:11] 7 and he goes on in this quote and he
[1:08:13] says and he visits the sins of the
[1:08:15] people upon their children from
[1:08:17] generation to generation that won't keep
[1:08:20] his
[1:08:21] word that won't keep his word yeah you
[1:08:24] want to know why you might have troubles
[1:08:27] or struggles you see ones that fall away
[1:08:29] from this message is cu they walked away
[1:08:30] from the
[1:08:32] word they walked away from the truth am
[1:08:36] and the sins are now upon their
[1:08:41] children I begin to think we all know
[1:08:43] what generational wealth is and I'm not
[1:08:46] talking
[1:08:48] financially I'm not talking financially
[1:08:51] though you know one might build an
[1:08:52] Enterprise and be able ble to build it
[1:08:54] up and sell it and he might be able to
[1:08:56] give generational wealth to his children
[1:09:00] and then his children and the children
[1:09:02] after that it's a continual
[1:09:06] thing but yet what are we doing tonight
[1:09:09] we're giving Our Generations after us
[1:09:12] generational wealth
[1:09:18] spiritually and we know that brother
[1:09:20] brandham says that salvation isn't just
[1:09:23] p through by natural birth we know that
[1:09:25] and that God has no
[1:09:27] grandchildren God has no grandchildren
[1:09:30] so we must all be tried and tested and
[1:09:32] proven as children Sons and Daughters of
[1:09:38] God and we understand that you can't
[1:09:41] make your kids seed or give them a
[1:09:44] revelation we know
[1:09:47] this that we all must come the same way
[1:09:49] that every one of us must be chased it
[1:09:51] must be tried and
[1:09:55] when these kids become of
[1:09:57] age and we begin to see them struggle or
[1:10:00] have a hard
[1:10:02] time brother brandom says it's not
[1:10:04] passed down through natural
[1:10:06] birth but let me ask you which one of
[1:10:09] you want to throw your kids out
[1:10:11] there the first the first time they
[1:10:14] start struggling or having a hard time
[1:10:15] or they start getting into things that
[1:10:18] they shouldn't how many want to throw in
[1:10:20] their towels on their kids because
[1:10:23] there's prom is in God's word that he
[1:10:25] says if you train up a child in the in
[1:10:27] the way of the Lord that's he will not
[1:10:29] depart from it whenever he is old
[1:10:34] amen he also says that the promise is
[1:10:37] unto you and to your children and to all
[1:10:39] that are AAR off even as many as our
[1:10:41] Lord Our God shall call amen so we have
[1:10:44] promises within his word that if we
[1:10:46] raise up a child in the way should
[1:10:49] go they won't depart from it it's not
[1:10:53] saying they won't have a hard time
[1:10:55] that's right listen I'm so thankful that
[1:10:57] whenever I was having a hard time I had
[1:10:59] a Godly mother and a Godly father that
[1:11:02] was at home praying for me amen you know
[1:11:05] I believe that there's a fine balance
[1:11:07] sometimes a kid's got to find himself
[1:11:10] sometimes we can coop up our kids in in
[1:11:12] a way that they're not allowed to go
[1:11:14] here and allowed to do this and you
[1:11:16] can't do this well eventually when they
[1:11:17] get their freedom they're going to go do
[1:11:20] it they're going to go do it MH and yet
[1:11:25] my parents on the football team I'd say
[1:11:27] Mom I'm going out and hanging out with
[1:11:28] the
[1:11:29] boys I'll be back I'm going to go to the
[1:11:31] gym 8:00 at night I thought it was an
[1:11:34] excuse good excuse then now I hear kids
[1:11:37] using it I'm like yeah
[1:11:40] right
[1:11:43] liar I've been there I know that
[1:11:47] excuse and a lot of times as kids you
[1:11:49] think that it's a good excuse like
[1:11:50] they'll never
[1:11:52] know yeah right
[1:11:54] yeah
[1:11:56] right but you
[1:11:58] see that there was a little bit of Grace
[1:12:01] there and my mom would tell me I'd say
[1:12:05] all right Mom I'm going out 8:00 I'm
[1:12:08] going to the gym okay I'm praying for
[1:12:09] you why you praying for me I'm going to
[1:12:11] the
[1:12:13] gym but yet it's
[1:12:17] something it's a great
[1:12:21] responsibility that we that we ra raise
[1:12:23] our kids
[1:12:25] up and that I'm going to believe the
[1:12:28] promises that God has said in his word
[1:12:29] for our kids brother brandham says in
[1:12:33] things that are to be he says you were
[1:12:34] all pre-planned by God nothing happens
[1:12:38] by chance with God he knows all about it
[1:12:43] it's all pre-planned planned for many
[1:12:45] generations back so that you could be
[1:12:47] here
[1:12:48] tonight did you know that that kind of
[1:12:51] blows my finite mind sure right that
[1:12:54] Generations ago God planned it for us to
[1:12:58] be here tonight he would know that you
[1:13:00] would choose to serve God he would know
[1:13:02] the very thoughts that you were thinking
[1:13:04] he would know everything about you that
[1:13:05] you would make a commitment to come to
[1:13:09] church because he placed something
[1:13:11] inside of
[1:13:15] you he says now the only way that you
[1:13:18] can be a son a daughter of God is
[1:13:20] because you have to be and have that
[1:13:22] eternal life
[1:13:24] there's there's only one form of eternal
[1:13:26] life and that's God's life only one form
[1:13:30] of eternal life and that was God there
[1:13:35] to be a Son of God you had to be in him
[1:13:38] always the gene of your
[1:13:41] life spiritual life tonight was in God
[1:13:45] the father and before there was even a
[1:13:47] molecule and you are nothing but the
[1:13:49] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:13:51] was in God as the Son of
[1:13:54] God you are nothing but a manifestation
[1:13:57] of him tonight that's right living out
[1:13:59] in this
[1:14:00] day you are now you are an expression
[1:14:04] you are
[1:14:05] expressed after his word has come into
[1:14:07] you to light up this
[1:14:09] age you are expressing God's life in you
[1:14:13] because you are a son and daughter of
[1:14:14] God therefore you get what I mean you
[1:14:17] are in you are in you are made you're
[1:14:22] setting in this church tonight because
[1:14:23] your duty is to express God to this
[1:14:26] nation and this people and this
[1:14:28] neighborhood where you're Associated
[1:14:30] amen isn't that something that your duty
[1:14:33] is to express God your duty is to
[1:14:38] express God to this nation and to those
[1:14:41] around you to everyone that you

[1:15:19] source that they can come
[1:15:21] to that there's something in my life

[1:15:32] other day he said James you got to say a
[1:15:34] prayer things are happening I need help
[1:15:38] why because they know that hey I ain't
[1:15:41] ashamed of what I believe this is our
[1:15:44] duty is to express and to be the living
[1:15:46] Christ of this
[1:15:48] day your very being should be to live
[1:15:51] out Christ's life to to everyone around
[1:15:54] you
[1:15:55] am you were pre pre-planned by God from
[1:15:59] Generations
[1:16:01] back yes sir and yet that second birth
[1:16:05] is what gives us access to these traits
[1:16:07] y right forget the natural forget your
[1:16:10] first
[1:16:12] birth it's the second birth is what
[1:16:14] gives you
[1:16:17] access he says in the resurrection of
[1:16:20] Lazarus he says look deity I am a part
[1:16:22] of Charles Brandon because I was born of
[1:16:24] Charles brandham my Daddy I'm a part of
[1:16:27] him I've got a forehead like him my hair
[1:16:29] is like him I'm a small man like him I'm
[1:16:32] in the nature like him because he's my
[1:16:34] daddy you see whenever you come from a
[1:16:37] father you begin to resemble everything
[1:16:39] that he is people can identify you by
[1:16:43] your father you ever been walking down a
[1:16:45] place and somebody says hey are you
[1:16:48] Michael's boy yeah you look just like
[1:16:51] him why because you look like
[1:16:55] him and he says the same thing he says
[1:16:57] and if you were and if we become in
[1:17:00] spirit son sons of God deity dwells in
[1:17:03] the man Hallelujah then you talk about
[1:17:06] blinded eyes being
[1:17:09] open they said nothing is impossible to
[1:17:11] God God said nothing is impossible with
[1:17:14] you if you'll believe not with God but
[1:17:17] with you deity and a man the the very
[1:17:20] God that stood back on there on the
[1:17:22] mythical platforms of Eternity and roll
[1:17:25] back rolled the worlds off his hands and
[1:17:27] created these things to give you the
[1:17:31] privilege Hallelujah gave you the
[1:17:33] privilege to be the sons of God listen
[1:17:35] isn't just a right it's not something
[1:17:38] that's owed to you you didn't earn it
[1:17:42] it's nothing we did to earn this amen
[1:17:45] but it's a privilege to be a Son of God
[1:17:50] it's a privilege and an honor that you
[1:17:52] must take with a great
[1:17:55] responsibility what a privilege we have
[1:17:58] what a blessed people we are Amen to be
[1:18:01] sons of God and he says and you are a
[1:18:04] part of him and God dwells in mankind
[1:18:06] and man himself in deity Hallelujah
[1:18:09] there you are he says it might choke you
[1:18:13] it might choke you but study over that a
[1:18:15] little
[1:18:16] while you might be choking a little bit
[1:18:18] but just keep
[1:18:21] chewing he says he he is God dwells in
[1:18:24] man and man becomes a Son of God not in
[1:18:27] him not himself not him in himself but
[1:18:31] the Holy Spirit that's in him in God the
[1:18:34] Creator lives in the creation oh my how
[1:18:37] I like that then stands with the
[1:18:39] unwavering faith and ask what you will
[1:18:41] it'll be done there it is listen the
[1:18:45] Creator lives in the creation I thought
[1:18:48] that was so powerful we're not talking
[1:18:50] about a creation out there though he cre
[1:18:52] created the worlds though he created
[1:18:55] everything he created the moon he
[1:18:56] created the Stars he created the trees
[1:18:59] to worship Him He created all these
[1:19:01] things that they might glorify him but
[1:19:04] yet he lives in the very creation of you
[1:19:07] he lives in the creation of mankind and
[1:19:10] yet that's what he expects from you is
[1:19:12] worship he expects praise he expects
[1:19:15] those things because it is a privilege
[1:19:18] to serve
[1:19:19] God it's Christ in you not after the
[1:19:23] first birth but the second amen you see
[1:19:27] and as we look at the generations of
[1:19:30] Jesus Christ all this was done through
[1:19:33] Pro that prophecy might be
[1:19:36] fulfilled that prophecy might be
[1:19:40] fulfilled and yet God is doing the same
[1:19:42] thing
[1:19:44] today he brought it down to a generation
[1:19:47] or Generations that at the final
[1:19:49] generation it would be a bride it would
[1:19:52] be an elect lady that would take him at
[1:19:54] his
[1:19:55] word that would say be it unto me
[1:19:57] according to Thy word not knowing what
[1:20:00] everything would happen after
[1:20:03] that but yet you say be it unto me
[1:20:06] according to your word and you become
[1:20:08] the Fulfillment of Prophecy for your day
[1:20:11] listen they were the prophecy in
[1:20:13] fulfillment for their day that a that a
[1:20:16] that a virgin would conceive that she
[1:20:18] would there would be an Immaculate
[1:20:19] Conception that was prophecy fulfillment
[1:20:22] for their age but you and I there's
[1:20:24] another prophecy being fulfilled there's
[1:20:27] manifestations there's things coming to
[1:20:29] pass there's a restoration of the word
[1:20:31] coming into fulfillment what is it it's
[1:20:34] you you the bride taking this word and
[1:20:37] saying be it unto me amen it's the
[1:20:40] impregnating of the word in this day not
[1:20:43] just conceiving seed you can receive
[1:20:45] seed through all these Generations but
[1:20:47] it's going to take a generation like you
[1:20:50] to say God be it unto me I reaccept AC
[1:20:53] that and you conceive that seed
[1:20:58] amen the final
[1:21:01] generation we should be an inspired
[1:21:04] generation amen we should be an inspired
[1:21:07] generation yes sir amen listen as we
[1:21:11] read the last will be more than the
[1:21:15] first we're not looking into the glare
[1:21:18] of another age we can't look back of
[1:21:22] where we come from from do you
[1:21:24] understand the glare of another age
[1:21:26] brother Brandon would explain it is out
[1:21:28] here in the
[1:21:29] desert you go out in the desert and you
[1:21:32] see a mirage way off you see water way
[1:21:35] out
[1:21:37] there and it looks real it looks like
[1:21:39] water off in the distance but when you
[1:21:42] get there there's nothing there right
[1:21:45] and as long as you keep looking at the
[1:21:46] glare of another age you will keep
[1:21:48] looking and receiving
[1:21:50] nothing because you're looking get
[1:21:52] something that isn't there it's not real
[1:21:55] amen it looks
[1:21:57] real but it's not real right but yet God
[1:22:01] has given us a word in this
[1:22:03] age he's given us a word in this
[1:22:10] age yes
[1:22:12] sir it's fresh Mana for our hour amen
[1:22:16] Revelation is becoming more clearer yes
[1:22:20] prophecies are coming to pass things
[1:22:21] that the prophets spoke of in the Bible
[1:22:24] things that our prophets spoke of things
[1:22:26] that are to be yeah
[1:22:29] right this day is this scripture
[1:22:31] fulfilled yes prophecies coming into
[1:22:36] manifestation right before our eyes yes
[1:22:39] it is and if we're not careful we'll
[1:22:41] miss it we'll begin to let up we begin
[1:22:45] to think that hey days are God's coming
[1:22:49] we know he's coming but when is he
[1:22:51] coming
[1:22:53] right there's ones traveling on this
[1:22:54] journey that have been a lot longer than
[1:22:56] I have but yet they're still faithful
[1:22:59] they're still believing because listen
[1:23:02] just as his blood won't lose his power
[1:23:04] his prophecies they will still come to
[1:23:06] pass amen no matter how long we go how
[1:23:09] many ages we keep going no matter how
[1:23:12] many generations keep coming under
[1:23:14] us that prophecy will come to
[1:23:20] fulfillment musicians
[1:23:23] come you are the
[1:23:25] generation of God coming into
[1:23:28] fulfillment for this
[1:23:30] hour everything God was he poured into
[1:23:33] Christ the
[1:23:35] man he was the fullness made flesh in
[1:23:38] that day everything God was he had the
[1:23:41] he poured everything into
[1:23:43] himself into
[1:23:46] Christ but yet he was still
[1:23:50] tempted he was still tried yeah he was
[1:23:54] still proven why because he wanted to
[1:23:57] come down as a man and feel the very
[1:24:00] things that you go through he wanted to
[1:24:02] know the pains that you would go through
[1:24:05] he wanted to feel those things and he
[1:24:08] learned obedience by what the things he
[1:24:11] suffered by the things he
[1:24:14] suffered but yet it still was the
[1:24:16] fullness for that
[1:24:18] day and yet
[1:24:20] prophecy he was the Fulfillment of
[1:24:24] Prophecy and everything Christ was he
[1:24:26] poured into the church yes into the
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:33] bride he poured himself out into you and
[1:24:38] I it's not of our first
[1:24:41] birth but it is of our second
[1:24:46] birth listen you can only blame your
[1:24:49] first birth for so long true yeah but if
[1:24:53] you
[1:24:56] say if you mean what you say and you say
[1:24:59] that I'm a son and daughter of God
[1:25:01] listen that's no more of an
[1:25:05] excuse that's no more of an excuse you
[1:25:07] can't use that no
[1:25:09] more because now it is your heavenly
[1:25:13] father that's right and you begin to
[1:25:15] take on the the traits of that heavenly
[1:25:20] father and everything Christ was he
[1:25:22] poured into you and I what is it deity
[1:25:26] in a
[1:25:28] man and he gave you and I the
[1:25:31] privilege amen he gave you and I the
[1:25:34] privilege to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:25:36] God
[1:25:38] Amen thank you
[1:25:40] Lord you know we went on that trip to
[1:25:42] Von watatu and we had a layover in
[1:25:45] Fiji and I didn't know that Fiji was an
[1:25:48] infu Indian infused
[1:25:50] Island so the they like Indian
[1:25:53] Polynesian people and
[1:25:55] they believe in Buddha and all that
[1:25:59] stuff and so we begin to tour and we
[1:26:02] told our taxi driver just take us with
[1:26:04] the brothers we begin to go and they
[1:26:06] took us to this Buddhist
[1:26:08] temple and we begin to walk around and
[1:26:11] we had to take our shoes off and you
[1:26:13] begin to walk around and you begin to
[1:26:14] see all these Idols all these Gods
[1:26:20] yeah and there was a god of wealth and
[1:26:23] of God of health and a God of this and a
[1:26:25] god of that and whatever you needed a
[1:26:27] God for it was
[1:26:30] there and you had to offer a
[1:26:35] sacrifice you had to offer a sacrifice
[1:26:37] to these idols and as we were there you
[1:26:40] seen young families come you seen ones
[1:26:42] that would come and they would begin to
[1:26:44] offer a sacrifice and it was fruit and
[1:26:47] it was milk and if you want this kind of
[1:26:49] blessing you got to offer this or you
[1:26:51] got to do all these different things and
[1:26:53] we are sitting there watching
[1:26:59] them yet as I begin to watch
[1:27:04] him I begin to think God don't ever let
[1:27:07] us become a
[1:27:09] place because you can tell that they're
[1:27:12] just doing it out of tradition that
[1:27:14] they're doing it just out of a ritual
[1:27:17] and it just becomes routine and every
[1:27:18] morning they get up and they go and they
[1:27:20] offer incense and they begin to do these
[1:27:22] different things and you see a man
[1:27:25] leading his
[1:27:26] family to offer these
[1:27:29] sacrifices unto all these different gods
[1:27:33] and I said God don't ever let us become
[1:27:35] to where we look like that to where we
[1:27:38] come to the house of God and it's not
[1:27:40] out of the love of God and there's no
[1:27:42] joy in our hearts and all these
[1:27:43] different things you see God yes amen he
[1:27:47] wants you to do it out of a loving
[1:27:50] heart he wants you to serve him with
[1:27:52] with your whole heart yes raise up a
[1:27:55] child in the way he shall go teach him
[1:27:58] how to pray teach him how to love
[1:28:01] God listen it's not just in
[1:28:04] our spiritual walk can
[1:28:07] we be an example to those after
[1:28:12] us but it's in our daily lives in the
[1:28:15] way we go to work and how we go to
[1:28:18] school how we conduct
[1:28:21] business
[1:28:23] listen that we have to be an example in
[1:28:25] every aspect of Our Lives because
[1:28:27] there's ones that are watching us
[1:28:29] there's ones even in the world you
[1:28:32] watch yeah I have customers that I go to
[1:28:36] and they know I'm a
[1:28:39] Christian and they'll you know they
[1:28:41] might say a cuss word or they might cuss
[1:28:42] a couple of times and they'll say it
[1:28:44] right away hey I'm sorry I didn't mean
[1:28:46] to that's
[1:28:48] respect I give him
[1:28:51] that but yet you watch you say you're a
[1:28:54] Christian and you go to these different
[1:28:56] things and you handle a situation
[1:28:59] incorrectly watch them drop them I
[1:29:01] thought you were a Christian I thought
[1:29:03] you believ this I thought you did
[1:29:06] this and you look at me like that you
[1:29:09] said this about this person they're
[1:29:12] watching
[1:29:14] right they're watching right ones within
[1:29:17] our assembly young men they're watching
[1:29:20] the olders yeah
[1:29:22] because you know what's worse you know
[1:29:23] what's the biggest stumbling BL a
[1:29:26] hypocritical Christian that's right a
[1:29:29] hypocritical Christian yeah true ah
[1:29:32] there's some that come to church I don't
[1:29:34] know why I'm going go ahead you come to
[1:29:38] church and you can see it on the outside
[1:29:39] and you serve God and you love God and
[1:29:42] from the surface man I couldn't tell
[1:29:43] anything
[1:29:46] different and you go out
[1:29:48] into the natural
[1:29:50] side man it's like two different
[1:29:56] people ah we all make mistakes I
[1:30:00] understand we all have faults I I know
[1:30:03] that but I say God help us because we
[1:30:06] are inspiring Generations you see it's
[1:30:08] God within every
[1:30:10] generation from every generation he
[1:30:12] keeps going amen and yet it's our job
[1:30:17] it's our privilege to serve God Amen
[1:30:22] yes not out of
[1:30:25] obligation even though he said it's out
[1:30:28] of Duty that we serve him out of Duty
[1:30:31] that we're a blessing to those around
[1:30:33] us
