s God bless you thank you so much for that amen God bless you all this evening greet you in the l l name of Jesus Christ so we have the final Trump that's probably coming into position you know listen some people are looking at that's the last great hope and everything let me there's only one hope that's in Jesus Christ I want you to know that you know different ones you know is this the Constantine that's going to come in or what you know who is this and what's what's going to happen listen last night last night you know Sandy and I stayed up until about 9:30 they said you probably know who would be president by 10:00 so we were interested and at 9:00 or 10:00 they didn't know so I said I'm going to bed man we went to bed I said listen I'm not going to sit here and worry about it and this and that I said the right one will be there but I said listen that still doesn't stop the prophecy of the end time America has been weighed in the balance and found wanting America is in trouble and he said you can put at George Washington or Abraham Lincoln uh in office now in every office and you'll not turn her so I have a quote here I'd like to play If The Brothers you just raise

City amen but we seek one to come amen that's right yes sir so politics is one side of the fence I'm on the other I said I I voted once that's for Christ I'm sure to win that's right see you got a vote coming see God voted for you the devil voted against you now which way you cast your votes where you're coming out so now I believe this person is just I'm going to think that it's just nervous

was Ezekiel sorry and the dry bones that was in the valley there the angel of the Lord said just say what I say and all gon had to do was repeat what the angel said and by repeating the very words the

a message that hasn't failed thoroughly Vindicated Amen in this day and hour amen praise the Lord so just humble to be here amen just want to say thank you again brother Ron for the opportunity brother appreciate it amen so I'm just want to get straight into the word amen calm my nerves amen praise the Lord amen so I just just had a little title this this this evening amen just um a temple made without hands amen just the Lord just would grant us the grace Amen to get my thought across in the way he showed it to me amen amen so praise the Lord if you have your Bibles amen just turn with me to Psalm 110 you love the Lord amen yes sir amen and we understand Psalm 110 is the prophecy of David concerning the coming Messiah amen so the Bible said from the first verse there says the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol the Lord shall send the rod out of thy strength out of Zion and you know Zion's the bride amen rule thou in the midst of thine enemies thy people shall be willing in the day of the power in the beauties of Holiness from the womb of the morning I love the way the scripture puts that the womb of the morning you know we we we the benefici of a new day amen the rising of the sun amen the womb of the morning thou Hast the due of thy Youth and then verse four says the Lord hath sworn amen God ha sworn and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of mesc amen and just think we'll leave it there and then just one more portion of scripture amen the book of Hebrews the ninth chapter and then you let you take the Comforts of your seat amen sorry to keep you standing just calming my nerves amen praise the Lord amen uh Hebrews the 9th chapter from verse one the Bible said then verily the first Covenant also ordinances of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table uh and the shoe bread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had the manor and aon's Rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant and over it the cherubims of Glory shadowing the mercy seed and notice what Paul says he says of which we cannot now speak particularly so there's something deeper there amen then verse 6 says now when these things were thus ordained the priest went always in the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but in the second went the high priest alone and every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the erors of the people the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing amen but how many know that it's death to stay out of the holies of holies now because we've been ushered in by the holy spirit amen which was verse 9 says which was the figure for the time then present in which we were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect that's why there had to be a change of the order amen the iranic couldn't do it amen verse 10 said which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse Washings and carnal Court um ordinances imposed on them until their time of reformation but Christ amen come in and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building not physical neither by the blood of goats and Cales but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us can we say Amen praise the Lord for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of an haer sprinkle sprinkling of the unclean Sanctified to the puring of the flesh purifying of the flesh verse 14 said how much more shall the blood of Christ whom through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Amen Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God Amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen praise His wonderful name I'm so grateful we have that high priest Christ Jesus amen that entered into the holies of holies once and for all amen once and for all this man forever made that Eternal sacrifice that us the worshiper will be purged from every trace of sin amen the Bible said he that is born of God cannot commit sin that's right brother brandham said you are The Virtuous spotless Blood Washed of the Living God Amen to him who who who is seated in Heavenly places there is now no condemnation for behold all things are made new by the womb of the morning rising of the sun amen that we've been Ben benici of in this day amen praise His wonderful name amen so so I just want to speak on this uh if the Lord would would help us and um I just want to just lay the foundation amen one quote brother random says amen um I actually didn't have the title there but I I believe it is in Mighty God unveiled brother random says um and when he come on Earth he was the Tree of Life do you believe that and Rome what did they do they he had he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed is he that hang on a tree become a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth a bride tree and listen to the prophet here striking statement it says which will be the Tree of Life rest restored back to him as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden by the same word and the same God made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back together again amen so it's beautiful um we understand there's this perfect Unity that is happening even now I know the flesh doesn't declare it because we still trapped in a body of time but brother brandom expressed it so clearly that we are creatures of Eternity amen this our our identification is not found in In the Flesh man amen but our identification is found in the inner man that which God purposed before the foundation of the world Amen that is who we are and what did the word do the word came our way to awaken the inner man to let us know who we are and I say thank God why because there's a Unity of between bride and bridegroom that is happening even now despite the way we feel sir amen doesn't matter how you feel what the flesh is saying still there is a Unity that happening between Christ and his bride why because the word declared it amen so so it's beautiful um so brother random begins to explain these things so clearly and and we understand um when when when when God spoke to Moses there um you see God was this um Myster you know when we when we when we think we have have things figured out with God we don't amen you know uh the more we think we understand the Bible the more we just left just bewildered because God God doesn't want to have us understand him in that way he's too big it's too magnificent for our little brains to think we understand you for as far as the East is the West so is my thoughts from you know the scriptures amen so we understand this is a a supernatural mysterious God always always been that way but God begin to explain and and and and begin to in a shadow that he that he paved out there in the Old Testament begin to express himself through Moses and he begin to give Moses a vision of what was in heaven and he begin to express to Moses Moses set up my Tabernacle on Earth and do this and that and you know how um create the the the the the the Tabernacle in such a way and and and and create the three courts and so forth why because God was beginning to in a measure introduce these Eternal thoughts to us in a measure beginning to express the Heavenly realm back on the Earth but you know brother random begins to express that this is a perfect Unity between the Eternal heavens and an Earthly bride this is the the union between a Heavenly bridegroom and an Earthly bride this is the marriage of Time and Eternity but when God begin to speak to Moses he had just expressed it in a little measure and I just want to go through these things if if if the Lord would um you know just um just to be quick but in the in the beginning there in the Garden of Eden you know um there's something as Paul said mysterious about these cherubims that I want to speak but I but this it's time fails us he says amen because there's more there than than what we realize eyes amen you understand we are such a blessed people because we we actually living in the climax can you believe it of the entire scriptures this people here today are beneficiaries of the Capstone Revelation that ends and restores Humanity back to eat again amen you know what the cross was was was was wonderful the blood sacrifice of God shed on Calvary the very blood of God flowed that we might have that sacrifice so that we can be ushed into his presence and then brother Brandon makes the statement and says um 78 years after the death of Christ he says when when John begin to see the lamb stepped forward to take the book in that in as it was caught up there brother brandom said if that never happened happened he said the whole of mankind would still be lost even after the cross amen why because we said what good is it if you pay if if we have a property if I have a property and I buy a property I put down the cost the price but if I don't have the title de I got nothing to prove but you see when the book opens down comes the mighty Angel unveils the word and something clicks on the inside that lets us know that we were in him before the foundation of the world what is that it's a claiming that's how you know you're part of him but that had to come by the breaking forth of the word of God so I say thank God for they without cannot even be made perfect they resting on us amen what a time what a Time the greatest time to live is this brother brandom said it why because it's the climax of humanity and I know it doesn't feel like it because we have trials and tests trapped in this body of Flesh waiting for the full Redemption take God at his word it's still the greatest time ever amen praise the Lord so if you have your Bibles um I know we had need to fire quick amen but just turn with me to Leviticus the 16 chapter amen I just want to encourage you amen just let you know that the Bible speaks of you how many know we in we we in the the um the the the banquet of vashi but we not vashy we Esther because when our King our lover our bridegroom bids us come we come because there's something on the inside that makes us want to please him we love him this message is not a book of rules and dos and don'ts to the young people this is a love affair brother brandham said he said if I don't attend another church service I'm still saved to the elect of God God gave you re uh uh Salvation free free gift free but we come to this church to service because we want to show him how much we love him for what he's already done for us it's an expression of love that's what this message is amen praise His wonderful name so we in the bank with a because the Bible said how King King azerus he had this magnificent display of his his power and then at the end of those feasts he he arranges another seven days and then he begins to display his his magnificent power bringing out the the vessels of gold and just had all the kings around him to stand in O of The Magnificent King but you know on the seventh day the king and his advisers could not find any other thing greater than to bring out vashi nothing greater than God revealing his bride King azerus could find nothing greater on the seventh day than to bring out vashi and display her beauty to the world Hallelujah but you know vashi turned that down but thank God for Esther amen amen in the day of Esther the seventh month 10th um uh Esther in the the in the in the final Church age she will come forth and she won't let the king down because God puts something before the foundation of the world on the inside of her that would call her forth when he says come she comes amen praise the Lord so verse so so you know and and you know these types in the scripture is so beautiful even The Book of Leviticus that's why we understand you know never turn down the Old Testament it's beautiful because it's a shadow of what God cannot change you see brother Ram said he left it there in the types why because it's a shadow of what he will do and he cannot change and when God begins to deal with Israel he's dealing with the Gentile at the exact same time Amen in when when in in the in the banquet of Esther when Esther begins to reveal haymon's secret and we understand Esther had that secret that she was she was she was clothed in a gent under a gentile name but when she begins to display it was the uncovering of both the Gentile and the Jew and what would happen in the in the queen in in the banquet of Esther so God deals with the Gentile in the spiritual sense and Israel in a natural sense we know this amen so so if you look at the oldest in the Leviticus there just I just want to verse 16 from verse one amen as I speed up the Bible says and the Lord spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they offered before the Lord and and and and and died and the Lord said unto Moses speak unto Aaron thy brother that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat which is upon the ark that he die not now this is a beautiful scripture verse one of the letter kth but the spirit giveth life because what God is saying there is unless I descend upon that Mercy seed is death amen that's why if you have the written word today it doesn't mean much there's a million churches that have the same Bible but it's only the bride that has the quickening of the spirit on the word to bring forth a life amen praise the Lord so you know I say in the message we shouldn't get too tied up with the semantics of the written word you have people arguing about what the prophet meant what he didn't mean what he meant to say and they and they and they begin to split hairs but you know what we don't we don't we don't look to the written word but we look to the quickening power of the Holy Spirit to bring the word to life cuz unless the shikina glory of God descended on The Mercy Seat it was still death why because we following the Living Word Amen brother brandom said if this Revelation doesn't produce the life of Jesus Christ he said we got the wrong Revelation it's a Living Word amongst the living people that prove that Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen so um just to I just want to uh pick things up a little quicker so you know Aon begins to we have the two scapegoats and don't want to touch too much on that but maybe from verse 15 amen maybe from verse 14 the Bible says uh Leviticus 16:14 and he shall take of the blood of The Bu bulock and sprinkle it with his finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times amen and notice the scripture said Eastward because the same Jesus that rises in the East the same one that came in the west he's the lion of the tribe of Judah that comes out of the East so it had to be sprinkled to the east a signifying of the cleansing power of the great sacrifice mesc amen that would be the lamb the Eternal priesthood of God that would restore the people his people back into the holies of holies amen amen but listen to verse 15 says this then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bulock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seed and before the mercy seed now listen to verse 16 striking it says and he we shall make an atonement atonement at one for listen to this for the holy place isn't that striking the Bible said he had to make an atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanliness of the children of Israel notice the Bible's not saying he had to make an atonement for the the people but it's saying he had to make an atonement for the holy place because of the transgression of the people so in other words there's this beautiful um um um idea of the scriptures bringing forth that the holy place and the people had to be one they are intimately connected in other words the transgression of the people affect the holy place yes even so that that that he had to make an atonement for the holy Place amen isin't that beautiful amen because of the unclean uncleanliness of the children of Israel and because of the transgressions in all their sins and so shall he do for the Tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth am among them in the midst of the uncleanliness so this is an atonement for the holy Place why because there's got to be as brother brandom said that tree of life has to become the bride Tree in other words the holy place has to become the people amen know you not that ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghost In other words the holy Place cannot uh uh uh be uh perfect without the people being restored back amen the Bible said in verse 17 and there shall be no man in the Tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth and make an atonement in the Holy place until he come out and have an atonement for himself and for his household and for the congregation of Israel verse 20 says this and when he hath made an end of reconcil look at this again and when he had made an end of reconciling the holy Place amen do you do you see that it's a Reconciliation of the Holy Place well when the high priest Aon went into the high priest what was he carrying on his shoulders the Bible said he had those onx those the stones of Onyx and he had those names of every tribe of Israel engraved in them in other words he was bearing upon his shoulders names elect as he went in a representation of people that always had to be in the holies of holies in fact the holies of the holies would become them and they would become the holies of holies for they would be the very Temple that God would now dwell in his bride so 20 says a reconciling of this holy place and the Tabernacle of the congregation and the Tabernacle of the congregation reconciling the holy place and the people together amen Praise Is Beautiful amen so um is this this working all right just want to go to the next slide sorry so so the Bible says there in in um and in Genesis it speaks of how um when when the fall had happened and Adam and Eve began you know they they were they God began to Usher them out of the Garden of Eden and the Bible said he put those cherubims guarding the way back to the tree of life and brother Bram said very explicitly he said the tree of life is the holiest of holies it's where the sh kind of Glory the very living word of God is made manifest so so as Adam and Eve uh uh they they through the fall God puts those cherubims but you know there's something mysterious about the cherubims because when you track the Journey of the cherubims you'll see it it comes back down to you amen and maybe we just fire quickly so so turn with me to eek do you mind me just leading a bit of scripture just to lay a foundation and we just uh hit it and then close amen so turn with me to Ezekiel the first um Ezekiel chapter 1 is going as the Lord leads amen so so there so so we see those cherubims they guard the way back to the tree of life but it seems as though those cherubs are just static in nature and you know we might have a a picture a mental picture of them just standing there with flaming swords guarding the way back to the tree of life but not so because in the in the shadow God begins to to to break forth upon Moses we see those cherubims over the ark amen over the ark so in other words we now know that wherever the word of God is those cherubims go so God displayed that to Moses he said Moses have those two cherubims with their wings tipped over The Mercy Seat which would the the the the the the the tables of stone as a protection just like it was in the Garden of Eden what's it doing protecting the manifested Living Word so now we see those those those you see those those uh staves of wood through those uh uh rings of gold that that the Levites would bear upon their shoulders as They Carried the word but wherever the word went those uh cherubs went so we're seeing those cherubims are not static but they're actually moving wherever the word is going they're moving so Ezekiel begins to pick up a different angle and take it deeper because remember this is this is God trying to reveal through the eons of time his very Eternal thoughts through a people every age was a people expressing an attribute of the mind of God so there Moses had a little shadow but Ezekiel brings something forth even deeper so turn with me quickly to Ezekiel chapter 1 amen still have like 30 30 minutes and then we start whining up amen is that right yeah um Ezekiel chapter 1 brother Ranch say give me a kick amen um Ezekiel chapter 1 so so he says um from verse four so now um e one of those prophets Daniel included that came out in the in the capture amen um in Babylonian times there so so he begins to express this in in in chapter 4 it says and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and fire unfolding itself and brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures so now we see it's it's it's not static like it was in Genesis but now we know that these cherubims over the Ark in the Tabernacle of Moses now actually have faces they have faces and mind you these would be the same faces that God would use throughout the seven Church ages to fight the devil so we understand now these cherubims actually have faces and Ezekiel uh begins to delve a bit deeper into the mystery of these cherubims as Paul said so let's continue he says uh verse 5 says and also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance look at this so four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man singular what are they doing they are going to these are are are representation of the fullness of the word of God they protect the ark the very word the essence Zoe the very life of God and we understand this is this is about a type of Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ was was brother randam said the three-fold purpose is to have the preeminence in Jesus Christ then to have the preeminence in the bride amen so we just we just another expr ex of the fullness of Christ in Pride form how many know that amen so so it says he had the likeness of a man let's go further and everyone had four faces everyone had four wings and their feet straight feet and The Souls of the feet was like the souls and there's so many symbols here you could take up months amen uh Sparkle the color of burnish bro and they had the hands and listen to this and they had had the hands of a man under their wings so when you behold these cherubims they look like a man keep that in the thought of your mind because when we close you'll see what I mean so they look like a man amen they had faces and their wings their wings were joined one to the other and uh turned not when they went they went everyone straight forward these these this being on on on on the left of a man but four faces can only go forth you say brother where do they go verse 10 says and as the likeness of their faces they for a face of a man and the face of a lion I'm just going speeding up if you don't mind on the right side uh they had the face of an ox and the face of an eagle amen so this is God's pattern doesn't change God established the the the tribes around Israel around the Tabernacle and everyone of of those tribes had a flag signifying the character lion eagle ox man so these cherubims Have Faces the same ones in the Garden of Eden the same ones that's following the ark the word they now have faces amen and then verse verse verse 12 says and they went everyone straight forward wherever the spirit was to go so wherever the spirit of God goes they go well they that are LED of the spirit they are the sons of God if the spirit leads you then aren't they going amen verse 13 says as the likeness and and this is um just notice this verse 13 um just just give me your attention amen I know I'm firing very quick and I apologize amen verse 13 says as the likeness of the living creatures they appearance I want you to notice a few things in verse 13 it says and the appearance was like burning coals of fire that's the first thing so when he's beholding these these four beasts that that have uh the appearance of a man he notice he notices burning coals of fire and then he notices the appearance of lamps amen and then he notices um uh uh it says uh and the the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning so he's noticing burning coals of fire lamps and lightning amen praise the Lord I'm just trying to see um and and notice um from verse 16 it says when he's beholding these creatures they look like they're traveling on Wheels so again there it's not static like in the Garden of Eden but these cherubims are moving like we seen with the ark they moving where the ark goes and not only there but they moving wherever the spirit of God goes they move that's why when when Ezekiel beholds them they look like they on Wheels amen now turn with me quickly to um just keep your finger on Ezekiel firing quickly amen we need the spirit of God Among Us just to keep us on the same page here amen turn with me to Revelations the 4th chapter you say brother what are you trying to do what are you trying to say I'm trying to let you know and we'll see what brother brandom said it said those living creatures is a representation of you you see you can trace your origin all the way back to Genesis that's a brother bam said the tree of life and the bride tree is the same thing amen why because inside you dwells deity and if deity dwells in you then those cherubims must be around you that's why they can be nothing defeat you they couldn't defeat God Christ through the seven Church ages how can the devil cap capture you even now with the random said they couldn't even get you in your unsafe State the devil how much more your safe state because of the eternal security of the elect seed of God nothing can befall you amen so remember we we said Ezekiel chapter 1 ver3 he said he seen those coals so maybe if I could just go back there I just want to get this mental picture so the old Tabernacle right going from east to west and again God doesn't make mistakes the same Sun that rises in the East sets in the west why did brother brandham have to go west because the holies of holies lays in the west brother random said when the gospel Goes West he said he can't go any further it got to go back East that's why the same message we receive like Queen Esther unveils the plan for the Gentiles and the Jews at the same time the same message goes back to the Jews under those two prophets same message message to reveal the atonement a Reconciliation of the Holy place and the people of God Amen Revelations the fourth chapter turn with me so now this Revelations chapter 4 is really even a clearer picture of what Ezekiel see clearer picture in the Bible say verse one says after this I looked and behold the door was opened to heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me said come up hither and I will show thee things to come that's why Saints we cannot be in Leo deia amen the the Jacob's Ladder connects Heaven and Earth Heaven and the bride of Christ Heaven and the body of Christ Jacob's Latter cannot connect you to Le deer because the Bible said angels of he of of God sent up and down bringing spiritual Revelation to you and I so in other words for you to to be caught up in the promises of God you cannot be Earthbound don't let your jobs and and what you do and around this connal way of life Trap you on WE Heavenly beings made to S the glory of God amen so come up here that's the call why because there's a door in heaven open God wants to show you just how special you are but how can he if we Earthbound amen praise the Lord says verse two and immediately I was in the spirit and and in the spirit so if you're in the spirit then those those cherubims must be following because it said wherever the spirit goes they they go you see there if you are in the spirit if you're being led of the spirit of God those cherubims must be with you amen said uh I was in heaven and there was a a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look on like a Jasper and saw a s and stone and there was a rainbow around about them around about the throne in sight like unto an emerald and round about The Throne were four living for four and 20 seats and upon those seats I Saw 4 and 20 elders and you know brother random said those Elders those were the 12 Patriarchs and the 12 disciples what what are they doing they there to testify that the same Jesus same God in Genesis is the same Jesus that comes forth and takes the book these are the witness that God cannot change and has not changed he's the same the same Angel of the Covenant that led them out in the first Exodus it's the same one we seen on the side these Elders are a witness that it's the same God same God Amen and upon the seats I Saw 4 and 20 ERS sitting clothed in white rayen and they had on the heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there you see remember um uh Ezekiel 1113 those lamps Ezekiel just seen them as lamps didn't Express much in Ezekiel 1113 but in five we now know those lamps there's seven of them and it says which are the seven spirits of God do you see this eternal uh uh unfailing of way God expresses his words in symbolic form but now in reality brother Ram said what's God trying to do is trying to have us have confidence in the word to know that he cannot change if God would would keep the written word so pure how can he fail with promises regarding us that should give us confidence in God and his word to know that the promises of God cannot fail and will not fail amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so uh just keep your finger again on Revelations 4 sorry and then go back to Ezekiel chapter 1 don't have much time amen so um so yeah so um if you notice if you turn with me to Ezekiel uh the first chapter still just from to verse 2 to 22 Ezekiel 1:22 the Bible said and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as color of terrible Crystal stretched forth over their heads above and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other everyone had two which covered on the side and everyone two which covered on that side their bodies and listen to verse 24 said and when they went I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of Great Waters what did Brother random said water signifies people remember in Revelations 4 thunderings Lightnings voices so now we know these cherubims where they where they when they when they flap their wings they make the sound of people amen is it coming home amen praise the Lord hallelujah now and so so you remember Ezekiel 1:13 we said uh those coals of fire um notice so what ezekiel's really seeing if we go back to the um yeah what Ezekiel is really seeing is is is is this because he said those those those cherubims he said they they had they had um the lamps going up and down before them he said they had coals burning coals and you notice that's the that what he's seeing is the altar of incense there because that's where the high priest would take the coals of the altar of incense and take it into the holies to make that that incense fill the holies of holies as a sweet Aroma to Christ to God right and then it says Lightnings and when they mooved they moved like lightning Ezekiel 113 what did Matthew 25 24 say the son of man as the lightning shineth from the East to the West so will the son the return of the son of man be Matthew 24 amen so you're seeing this this perfect you see this message you know this message is the gospel truth amen you know sometimes we we use the term message in in in a way that that that confuses us because we we make it look like it's something outside of the Bible this is not a movement this is the in the beginning God now revealing himself hasn't changed the message is the reality of who God is this is the ongoing testimony of Jesus Christ which is the spirit of Prophecy the Bible says amen amen so don't look at this message young people as a book of rules if dos and don'ts a movement this is the gospel of God it's only one this is the truth amen that's what I'm trying to show amen amen so brother random brother random basically he makes uh you know uh maybe sorry back there I think the brothers at the back are going to kick me out and fire me pretty soon um yeah so Ezekiel 1 turn I'm we closing Ezekiel 1 126 just uh verse 26 turn with me again 26 Ezekiel 1 126 the Bible says and above the firmament that was over their heads was a likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above it above upon it and I saw as the color of amber as the appearance of fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and for the appearance of his loins even downward and I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness roundabout verse 28 as the appearance of the bow that is in a cloud in the day of rain now you know brother random said this picture is an exact expression of Ezekiel 1 12627 amen you see that's why you know we should not develop uh denominational pictures in our head of angels fluttering and you know physical images of an eagle and a beast they they just symbols that represent things God wants to bring to us in reality form so so brother random said Ezekiel and we'll see the quote this is a representation of Ezekiel 26-28 but you don't physically see the the lion the ox the eagle there do you you don't physically see it but yet brother Bram said it is yes amen because what is it it's not a carnal understanding of of this the symbols in that way but it's an expression of the power of God protecting the believer because the word of God is veiled in The Believer and wherever the believer goes the spirit of God goes go and wherever the spirit of God goes the believer goes therefore those beings must be there as the power God sends the church and I mean we could break down those you know but these beasts have have have have have symbols and they have ways and and powers that they that they that they protect us by right amen so this brother brandom said is an expression of Ezekiel 1:26 closing you know brother Ram says this he says I want you to remember God still exists in the same colors he said from the loins upward from the amber color this is in the Hebrews the Hebrew series four he says I want you to remember God will exist in the same colors from the loins upwards uh fire amber color shot with a movie camera or with a color camera Amber from the loins up from the loins down and all around many colors like is in the rainbow in the sky after rain it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Holy Spirit still in his power still in his church in the last day there you are amen not me I was just standing there but it was a picture that was taken I want you to look same way and flush the same way of the living creatures what is it question mark brother random said the living creatures represent presentent The Living Church amen the church that's living by the power and the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen so we understand the the Bible the Bible said and it was a a rainbow there where these these these beasts that when when they were expressed it was like a rainbow according to Ezekiel 128 like a rainbow so the rainbow is the Angel of the Covenant which is Jesus Christ the promise that that cannot fail well I seen another Mighty Angel amen Revelations 10 come down one foot upon the Earth One upon the sea one upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice amen and it had a rainbow over his head the Bible said what is it the same Jesus what is he doing expressing himself in bright form expressing himself in Bride form that bride would be the expression of the power of those beasts in the Living Church to prove that they are now the temple of God Amen I'm closing amen one more scripture Revelations chapter 5 verse 5 says amen maybe from verse three says and no man in heaven knowing the Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book NE neither to look thereon and one of the elders sayith unto me weep not below the line of the tribe of Judah see that's why it had to be sprinkled to the east on The Mercy Seat because this is the same Jesus that that come out of Judah the East yes but what's he doing brother brandom said he's taking that hickey through seven Church ages going west you know brother random said in in in the breach he said um he said what's what's he's expressing uh this this Revelations chapter 5 and he said what's Jesus doing he said he's coming for the Jews how many know that scripture brother Ram's not making a mistake because we said when he reveals himself to the Gentiles he's doing the same to the Jews he's working on both sides at the same time one in spiritual one in natural form so as he's coming to reveal himself but what's he doing is in his in his descent is's finding a bride a gentile bride through seven Church ages and then when he snatches her away he goes back to his people because when we go far east the gospel cannot go any further but go west east go east again we've gone west as far far as we could go what to do to preserve the type the high priest would come out of the East and go west as he was sprinkling the blood going into the holies of holies but the high priest could not go any further west he had to come back out the same way through the Eastern Gate again and declare the reconciliation and the congregation of of Israel and the holy place to the people amen what's this thinging it's bringing the atonement to a gentile and a Jewish people we've received ours and they will receive theirs amen oh Saints you know it's we so blessed the same message we had revealed both the light to the Gentile and what should happen for the Jews amen what a blessed people we are we're not stumbling in darkness but our eyes is wide open spiritually thank you Lord amen so he says and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look thereon thank God and one of the elders said weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld in low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts now I want you to notice who's around the throne just read it with me says and I behold and loow in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the of the elders stood a lamb so there's only the four and 20 elders and the beasts right and the lamb stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The listen to this when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb so who's falling down who's represented around the throne there it's just the four and 20 elders and the four beasts right but look what he said having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of the oders which are the prayers of the Saints so now we know there's you represented there too amen you see that and then the Bible said verse 9 and they sung and you sng what we just seen it's just the 4 and 20 elders and the beasts and the prayers of the Saints so but they sung this is This Is Us in Angelic form around the throne worshiping God represented by the powers in the church amen so brother random said those Beast represent the church that's living in the power of the resurrection of Christ and they sung a new song Amen do you see that this evening Saints these are your repres these beasts represent you clothed in the power of the the church that God sends the church clothed in that power you're there and then brother brandom said well these had they couldn't be Angels because they said thou has redeemed us so if the Beast were and the 4 and20 ERS were around the throne worshiping God why did they say we were you redeemed us maybe let's let's say and they sung a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and Nations amen praise the Lord what is that the Church of the Living God Amen the very Temple of the Holy Ghost the very the very fullness of God that's now dwelling in his bright in his bride poured out of Christ into the church and there those Powers represent her that where she is they are where the spirit of God is they are therefore I say to you Saints what can separate you from the love of God what trial what test what situation when God so proved in his word that you went all the way from Genesis and you found in Revelations where the spirit and the bride say come this Bible speaks of you amen the message speaks of you this is Christ revealing himself though in symbolic form there but here we sitting in Christ Jesus expressing the very reality of what God had in his mind I say thank you Lord amen let's stand our feet praise the Lord amen prise the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord I Lord just time just and I just Lord just maybe a broken up sermon father but I just pray that the Holy Spirit would just take the words Lord and just form the picture god of what You' have us see father that Lord your bride is traced her Origins goes all the way back before the foundation of the world father the Garden of Eden Lord and she she she followed that great Blood Trail Lord all the way way to the Cross father right to the expressing of the word Lord that would call them by name father brother brandom said it's not or man Neville not Lil not an audible name but the mystery of the word calls her forth father and Lord though they don't understand it or might not be able to theologically explain it but something deep down says Lord I am there I was there and I say God in times of our trials and tests Lord may we remember the power Lord that you sent the church God I know we don't feel like it at times Lord because Lord we twofold beings father straddling Time and Eternity Lord and we have issues Lord unsaved family and Lord just chaos and and turmoil sometimes Lord and it sometimes feels like we're not even saved but that's a lie Lord when we look into the mirror of your word we see our origin all the way back to the end the beginning father and in moments of Trials and tests Lord may we remember that Lord as unchanging and as un unfailing as you are Lord we are too you cannot fail and we cannot fail Lord bless your people father I pray that you just give them a special anointing Lord in an hour as deceptive as this Lord God we see Israel Lord a little Drop in the Ocean Lord surrounded by the enemies being bombarded from all angles Lord but we understand that's a type maybe of what's happening in the spiritual to your bride father but Lord we will have the victory father CU you promised it and Lord you cannot fail Lord Jesus we say thank you Lord we love and appreciate you we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you amen you see that the word of God is all tied together the Old Testament has enfolded in itself the unveiling of the New Testament that's why you can look in the Old Testament and see those types and shadows and they just come right over into the New Testament amen praise the Lord you see the Jews right now are getting ready to go back to Temple worship we're hearing all about the red heer and the Jews and articles of the temple and everything do you realize that the Gentiles have already went to Temple worship and they shall worship Him in spirit and in truth what Temple though in a house not made with hands that's why brother Brandon one of the last sermons what house you going to build me amen he's talking about listen the this Temple know you not that these these bodies are temples of the Living God so as we go into our Temple Worship in spirit and truth right and you see the 4 and 20 Elders all of this is all mixing together they're getting ready and when Joseph reveals himself he puts everyone else out and he has them in their tribal order and they think they're going to get in trouble Hallelujah he's probably going to kill us because he's he he spoke in an Egyptian tongue but when he turned to his brother and he spoke perfect Hebrew then they knew it's him then he thought we're in trouble hey you would too you take your brother and throw him in a ditch tell the father he's been killed by a beast and everything cuz you were jealous cuz he was spiritual and here he is and they said oh my he's going to he's probably going to kill us he's going to have Vengeance he said no he said God did this for a purpose [Music] am you mean the pit and in the prison and all of that was purpose that God was using to bring him to the Throne so you look this pit that you're in and this prison and this nonsense that you go through here yes that's not your final place you know what Hallelujah this world is not my home this Kingdom's got to fall apart why there's another one coming huh Hallelujah don't you just love the word of God how it's so fitly put together oh my if our eyes

this oh my look at this King coming up look at this one doing that look at David being anointed look at all of this oh my and it's just types and shadows brother Bram said I go back there and I see what was to see what will [Music] be because future events are made clear by prophecy I look at the prophetic word and then I understand what will be praise the Lord hey this message is not rules and regulations it's prophecy amen hallelujah and the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy that's why when it come come to you huh God's not asking did you understand it did you catch it all you know like brother renham asked Billy Paul did I think it was invisible Union of the bride of Christ Billy did you catch that oh yeah sure daddy oh I got it yeah the the invisible Union and and
