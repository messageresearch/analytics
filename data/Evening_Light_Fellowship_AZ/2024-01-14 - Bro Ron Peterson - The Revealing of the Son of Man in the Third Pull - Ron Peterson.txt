if you would sing after brother James that would be greatly appreciated this morning amen some more guests that I've noticed since we started song service sister Marty's got a friend here and her

praise Him amen Lord bless you James amen praise the Lord you glad to be in the house this morning amen I know who's here you you got to believe it it's his word it's his promise right just share a little testimony really quick before we sing the song because it I think it had a little bit more meaning to the words that day my wife and I were fellowshipping about some things and we were talking about present needs and you know how God Is So present and amen something come over me and I was like you know I said it's kind of like this in the natural I said uh our son sits down at the table and he's hungry right there that's his present need but we've born into a family we were educated with certain education to get a certain job to earn a certain paycheck to cash that check at the bank and take it to the store gather the goods bring them home prepare a meal there was a lot of preparation going in to meeting that present need that's a very finite thought considering that God started working on our need before the foundation of the world ever began and not only did he start working on it but he started started running come on brother yes sir I'm telling you this morning Hallelujah he began to run to us from that moment in time knowing right where we would be right where we would set this morning exactly what the need is that you have present tense he began to put things in place and running not hesitating but running to meet that amen so maybe if you think about that thought for just a minute the words of this song will meet a little bit differently to [Music] us almighty God The Great I Am immovable Rock omnipotent powerful awesome God Victorious Warrior commanding King of Kings Mighty conqueror and the only time think about it now the only time I ever saw him run was when he ran to me he took took me in his arms held my head to his chest and said my sons come home again lifted my face he wiped the tears from my eyes with forgiveness in his voice he said Son do you know I still love you oh he CAU me by surprise When God Ran the day I left home I knew I'd broken his heart and I wondered then if things could ever be the same then one night I remembered his love for me and down that dusty road ahead I could see it was the only time it was the only time I ever saw him run and he run to me he took me in his arms held my head to his chest and said my sons come home again lifted my face wiped the tears from my eyes with forgiveness in his voice he said Son do you know I still love you he caught me by surprise and he brought me to my knees When God [Applause] Ran I saw him run to me he took me in his arms held my head to his chest and said my sons come home again lifted my face he wiped the tears from my eyes with forgiveness in his voice he said Son oh this morning he said Son oh he called me son and he said do you know I still love [Laughter] you he called me by surprise he brought me to my knees When God Ran thank you handheld or this either or it's good to good to have you here today welcome back it's good to be there amen whatever amen thank you God bless you all this morning it's uh it's good to be here am kind of home away from home I'm very thankful that we made it one more time uh every year is a blessing to us amen uh in more ways than one but it's good to be here today and uh and you know I feel a little important here today at least I get to sing once in a while at home I don't sing at all I remember my grandpa you know and that it was a long time ago but back in the 50s and uh it was the time when horses were being faded out and automob begin to come in you know the model T's and a and and uh in the well it was already in the 30s 40s and 50s but it was a place one little thing he hated to let go he liked his running horse he called a major one that he hooked his buggy up to and and every once in a while he'd go for a ride and then he get a little he put him to pasture you know after a while I kind of feel like I'm put to pasture because I'm old made me think of that maybe every once in a while he'd go out and you with a little uh bit of oats and bring him in and he' harness him I remember one particular time I was out on the field working already it was about 12 years old and uh my grandfather came out with his horse and buggy just to show me the era that he'd been in it was a fading area and it's a fading era no matter what we're we're enjoying this moment but there's something greater the greatest of all things is to meet the one physically with a body like his own glorious body now we know we're fading and I've heard you've had quite a bit of good times bad times but they didn't just go over in this church they're everywhere some have passed away in the last year others have been born some of the cutest little babies and some of are my very close Kim some of it's Justin's fault yeah some of the cutest little things but I'm great to sing a song that I feel is one of my you know it's not you know there's so many good songs in the world that that but everyone one once in a while some of the songs that stick with you yeah had it not been right for a man called Jesus where would we be that's right what would we be and it's not to go back to pastor and get the old horse out but look once in a while it's good to look back where you came from why you're sitting where you're at what was it that did it had it not been that's right for our name's been written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world not only did he cover our sin but he divorced it's not even existence Hallelujah the prophet said God has never seen your sin it's always had an atonement but we didn't recognize it till he revealed it to us just suppose God search through [Music] Heaven he couldn't find what one willing to be the spreme sacrifice that was [Music] needed to buy eternal life Hallelujah for you and me had it not been for a place called Mount [Music] Calvary and had it not been for the old ruged [Music] cross oh had it not been for a man called [Music] Jesus then for ever my soul would be [Music] lost I'm so glad he was willing to drink his bitter cup although he prayed father let it pass from me and I'm so glad they never called Heaven's angels from my hands pull these nails that torment me sing it with me oh had it not been for a place called Mount Calvary and had it not been for the old ruged [Music] cross oh had it not been for a man called Jesus amen then forever my soul will be lost oh had it not not been for a place called Mount Calvary and had it not been for the old ruged cross oh had it not been for a man called Jesus all than for Forever My Soul would be lost yes Forever My Soul would have been lost amen God bless you all thank you thank you for singing amen amen thank you brother minow brother Dennis gansky is here from the same church as brother minow so when you go home you just need to start requesting brother minow to sing so he can sing more often in his home church amen we'll we we can fix that problem for you brother minow amen let's all stand this morning the greatest love story it's good to have our pastor back to speak this morning for him may we pull upon the gift of God in his life today and I am so thankful that you and I are part of that great love story and the promise of it all Jesus is coming back for us I say thank you Lord for that today amen let's cast our cares on him because he cares for you and I amen let's pull upon the gift of God this morning God's got something for us cuz he's already been here and he's going to continue to deal with us today amen and so I'm casting all my cares on you I know you love me Redemption by amen and that's the greatest and full restoration for that's what seven angels in a clown testify by Redeemer no longer de he's and he's coming back for you sing it as a testimony again so I'm all my cares on [Music] you Redemption by Blood oh that's the greatest of story oh restoration h that's what seven angels in a redem no longer [Applause] D coming back for you and me amen you believe [Music] that Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord God bless you all this morning it's been a while since I've been behind the pulpit as far as actually Ministry I want to say thank you to all of those in position whether they are my helpers directly within the ministry or Those Behind the Scenes musicians each and every one our technicians they all take up the slack in our absence am and um so uh this is being the first time in the pulpit in 2024 and um I have great expectations for this year amen amen because God's going to be greater than he ever has been would I be odd to say that I want this to be the year of his catching away of his bride there's so many things happening I'm kind of so so very tired of this world and the way that it's going and I think like that mother Eagle what she does when it's time from them Eagles to fly she starts pulling out all of the soft stuff well I've been poked and prodded there ain't nothing soft in this world to sit down on oh you look at the news makes you sick you know amen there's only one news that'll make you happy that's a good news amen and he told us these things would he said it'll get worse and worse seducers will wax worse and worse and when you see this happening and that happening we see it happening we see Israel in the Homeland we see it we see he says and trouble in on every hand and Nation against nation and wars and rumors and Wars but look up because these things must come to pass but I tell you they're just kind of squeezing in on you huh bombarding the Min and maybe that's the squeeze he's talking about cuz he get squeezed from down here below get squeezed from everything like that like a tube of toothpaste you squeeze it too much and guess which way it goes we're getting out of here praise the Lord so um several told me this morning to keep my train of thought where was I um and to stay with my notes and God bless you musicians thank you so much God bless you played so nicely in the song specials and brother meno God bless you brother James praise the Lord um so let's turn to the Book of Genesis Book of Genesis chapter 17 now the reason that minister actually should have an outline of some sort or some notes is that they are taking you in a certain direction so this morning I want to take you somewhere I think every Minister when he preaches he's taking you somewhere or he may take you nowhere he may take you on just a little path over here uh over into Jeremiah over into Ezekiel this and that when it gets done there ain't no picture right you say okay it was good he had a lot of inspiration he shouted his quotes but it had no effect so when a minister when he gets done you should be able to say I see the picture I understand what he was saying because the Bible says even a wayfaring man could understand the ways of Jesus and so the reason that we have notes is so we kind of have a train of thought that we go in a certain direction and it's just an outline and then God does the filling Genesis 17 veres 1-5 and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God God walk before me and be thou perfect my he says I am almighty God I'm met should I and I want you to walk before me perfect I imagine that he swallowed quite heavy like oh my because what God requests he requires amen and I will make my Covenant between me in thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee amen God appearing to Abraham for a purpose Abraham has tried he has struggled he has pondered he has prayed he has done everything humanly possible to bring the promise to pass and he was a failure kind of reminds us of us amen we try to make things come to pass but you know what it's actually God who does it that's right and I hope to substantiate some of this to you throughout this sermon turn with me if you would to Luke 17 Luke chap 17: 28 and 30 very familiar portion of scripture this morning and if you're there say Amen Luke 17 verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded actually there's nothing wrong with what they're doing that's right but the same day that lot went out of Sodom yes it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed may the Lord add the blessing L to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord God bless you brother Mike Patterson I heard you weren't feeling well I am so very very pleased my brother that you're here you and sister py amen precious friends of ours amen he'd inspired me many many times as a young man in the early Ministry up there in our church in Flagstaff now I want all of you to understand let me just for just a moment relax my spirit the prophet of God says that he had been away he says I've been out of the pulpit for three months longest time since he had started his ministry and he says you all know he says there's a channel there's uh an anointing that you've got to find an inspiration and so I wish to kind of relax my mind here for just a moment before I get into it and share some things that the Lord's been dealing with on my heart the Bible says that the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy so I want you to understand that this message that we hold dear to our heart is a very Supernatural message we are compassed about by a mighty host of witnesses the prophet of God said that that uh outer realm the realm of God Heaven is penetrating down into this realm and he says and so hell is also interpenetrating so we are living in a realm of two kingdoms in Conflict amen yes sir and he says but there will be a group of people predestinated elect of God ordained to catch in this hour what God is doing you should familiarize yourself in fact you should be sensitized to the realm of the supernatural visions and Revelations should be your portion on a daily basis it's not one time a week it's not one time a month it is God dealing with you on a daily basis you were born to catch what others cannot you are born to see what others cannot see and I want you to to familiarize yourself and get comfortable with the fact that you are bumping right now with those around you yes you have witnesses but there I want to take you farther than that which you see because even in this realm right now moving up and down there are angels they are moving all around there are different Angels coming some are asking for this some are asking for that and God is sending his angels and that's causing you it has a purpose it's doing something to you God is sharing with you the thoughts that he had watch this not in the beginning but before the beginning the back part watch this he said not up here in the frontal lobe right back here in the back of his mind back where God was creating in the very back parts of his mind he's now sharing those thoughts that he had before the beginning there is a little bride predestinated she's catching those thoughts what are thoughts Hallelujah that are caught in the supernal it is God's thought take it further it's God's revelation coming to your mortal brain quickening you in this realm and God bringing you understanding that's what Revelation is is making known his thoughts the thoughts he had of you before the foundation of the world letting you know who you are and how you can take your [Applause] position the bride is catching this Revelation in 2024 I'm going to declare unto you it will happen more and more deeper and longer and it'll Captivate you it'll Quicken you and if it's not I doubt your bride the prophet of God said that little bride will catch yeah the mind of God and she will know what he wants done with the word yes sir absolutely she is a predestinated people to catch it it's hid from the wise and prudent but revealed unto babes that word babes is used very few times in the scripture so it's he didn't say babies he said babes I've told you this before but I'll reiterate it maybe somebody else here has never heard it it comes from the Greek word nepos it's a compound word it means a child yes but it means one who spoken so the spoken word child it is revealed unto babes that makes you a special person one who has an ability not only some one who is born into this world brother Brenham said some of them are born as as Canon th that's true he said they never had a chance but he says but you he says God has predestinated you thank you Lord to hear what the spirit is saying to have a clear understanding of a position understand this message is a positioning message hallelujah hallelujah you will hear and watch the symphony as it goes the prophet of God said that bride will have an ear to catch when the symphony goes higher he said when it goes from the second Pole to the third pole he says you that are spiritual you'll notice the music went an otive high let me tell you we've gone an otive higher right now we're into a higher realm the music is getting better you got to watch the beat you got to C see Hallelujah somebody say I'm catching it yes sir you got to embrace it unto yourself don't you dare pass this message off to a Hagar you say be it unto me according to Thy word amen the the bride has caught the change that revealed word between the sixth and seventh trumpet there are actually three prophets yeah amen and he says there's one Prophet to the Gentiles yeah amen and he says and when he finishes he will finish the mystery of God amen amen and I want all of you to understand that you all play an integral part on this mystery because you're a part of the mystery in fact you're such a mystery you're still trying to catch it yourself somebody say Amen don't let me be the only only one I may be the slowest one in the class but I'm catching it amen you ain't getting out of here without me and I ain't getting out of here without you so I say let's go together let's be caught up Hallelujah let's be caught up and be quicking Hallelujah this is not how dare you make this message rules regulations cut hair makeup all of that kind of stuff that has a part but I tell you this message is the revelation of Jesus Christ it is the mystery what's going to get you out of here God behold I show you a mystery in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we'll all be changed thank Lord amen hallelujah one Propet to the Gentile house and two prophets to the Jews he said when this one goes up the other two come down Moses and Elijah how close are we hallelujah amen what we see or what we see what he has done is okay what we see what he will do sometimes we get so caught up on let's look to this let's look to that and fail to see what he's doing amen I believe in preaching a present tense gospel what's happening now somebody say now because now incorporates me that means it's my time if we're going to do something my own my mother you to when she tell you boys I want you to come and we could play around if she didn't use the word now because she said and if she used my name it was even more important Ronald Allen now and I knew it wasn't no counting to three it wasn't sitting near him waiting till the second call she said now amen amen amen amen hallelujah prise the Lord is this okay I'm just amen come on brother I'm feeling a little something but I'm also testing this old man to see how quick his battery is draining I might just have to sing take the name of Jesus with you let you go home many he see what he's done look forward to what he's doing and Miss what he's doing that's right but I believe that the time has come let me say this he says I'll ride this Trail one more time it's a promise now if you go and look at the multiple times that he has says it I want you to know that he says notice it's a promise of God oh I look to the west and according to the vision there he was on a white horse I had the feathers in the Hat and he said you stay here and look on this I've got to go west right you remember and he says I'll ride this Trail one more time it's a promise amen right then another time he says that watch in the west will come a white horse rider yeah remember it's a promise we've had a dream about it and he says now watch she'll turn in the west yes she will yeah she'll ride the trail right then in another place he says whe ride the trail one more time I want to make it personal I want to bring it down you say a prophet he means what he says and says what he means it don't need no interpretation which one is it I will she will or we will I'll tell you it's all three why because it's a prophetic word let me say come on well let's put my title up here so that the Brethren will see it and you all will see the direction I'm going I'm just trying to get comfortable right now I'm titling my sermon this morning the revealing of the son son of man in the third pole now watch the subject the mystery continues the ministry continues and The Voice Hallelujah continues I will have you bear witness the prophet of God said in every move in every age in every day since the beginning of time he said whenever God's man goes off of the scene he'll take his man but not the spirit right he said he's always somebody say always always he's always got a representative on the earth praise the Lord I'm one of them amen I am I am an ambassador of Christ yes I am a revelation of this message in flesh it is no longer on a tape it is no longer on a bookshelf it is in a living entity can you say Amen you have to say that's me you have to understand it's you this word of God has got to be in you am the prophet of God said this bride she under her messenger's voice will be the final voice to the final age what a responsibility that is Amen to think that God would have such confidence right that he would allow you to be a part of that which would be the final Voice Hallelujah he's not going to send another messenger that's right he's not going to raise up another Prophet he's going to raise up a bride Eve was the mystery of Adam revealed we've had a second Adam a revealed word given to us and now that this bride that we might call the elect lady is the mystery of Jesus Christ revealed amen exactly amen the spirit and the bride are one and they say the same thing I'm just rehearsing this over in my mind still trying you relax will you relax with me there was a time of eler it was a good time for eler was a faithful servant he was sent to go find a bride for Isaac how many of you can say I've heard elaser yes sir eler didn't talk about himself elazer was not trying to take honor to him he wasn't trying to get the bride to marry him right amen he was pointing so much to Isaac he says I've got some jewels that Isaac gave me I got some gifts that Isaac gave me on I got some garments that Isaac gave me and while he was yet in prayer oh God thy servant doesn't have the ability to find the woman this virtuous woman right for Isaac right on but if thou would see favor to thy servant oh God would you let her enter the scene for I have not much time right and would you let her if I ask her of water would you let her repeat I'll not only give you water but I'll Water your camels Hallelujah and he no sooner prayed and ended his prayer until here she come she come no doubt with a water pot God does something with women around Wells come on Amen and here she come woman would you give me to drink oh look at her attitude yeah well might cost you a little something if you ask me to get you a drink no no she would no I hey I'll be more than happy too she' been taught right she's got virtue she's a reflection of something so hey not hey you know what I got an idea your camels are looking at me real thirsty too you do you know how much they drink when they're thirsty they can eat drink almost 30 gallons each and if you got a f you ever carried five gallons of water now I don't know how many camels there were but this is an all morning job now what is it she stepped into the vision he had prayed prayed and while he was finishing his prayer choosing a bride catch it spiritually while he's preaching the words that God what he's looking for what kind of a woman he wants to marry and everything and she comes on the scene I want you to know that while this Prophet was yet preaching what kind of woman God is looking for here it was many of you some of you may not have been born but God knew you would be God knew he knew there was a time but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound praise the Lord and then Rebecca she falls in love not with elaser she falls in love with Isaac who's unseen because elaser had painted such a good picture that she said Hallelujah I'll go where do I sign and the Bible says and she jeweled herself she took the gifts it she took the garments they were Isaac's yeah they were the ones that Isaac chose there's probably no doubt in my mind that when he went shopping and he went through the market that morning here yeah yeah no this one's better she'll be about this big he throws it over the arm of eler they're walking through the the Garment getting the the different colors and everything and he says wrap them up he said that's for my bride and because watch this when Isaac sees her yep he knows it's her why that's the dress those are the garments ooo I can start preaching and it's got to be because there's El eer there's the camel the power the Beast that is to and brother Brenham said the very thing she [Applause] watered took her to her iy may I say this and you be spiritual enough to catch it that you that water this message you that eat and drink of this message this Beast this power is taking you listen you may not be there yet but have faith that Camel knows where he's going he's like a horse when you take a horse he knows where his Barn's at you turn him towards home and his Pace quickens I tell you what that old camel he got closer to home and him big old long legs through that sin dude Hallelujah I believe we are close to home and I believe things are coming to pass now that we've never seen [Applause] before hallelujah thank you Lord Rebecca this bride is dressed right now Amen brother ramam said if I can get her to stand still long enough he said I'll dress her in in the word hallelujah word upon word line upon line Hallelujah now I feel comfortable let's see how far I can go in my notes the revealing of the son of man in the third pole the mystery continues the ministry continues and the voice yeah continues amen because some say the mystery was finished well he's finishing up the mystery but we realize that we're a part of that mystery so therefore and I say this in humility God is revealing more to me now than I did when I first came into the message why my maturity requires it that's right because when I was a child I spake I I thought I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things people who do not give up childish things on their own are spoiled some are brats some like you and me at times don't want something taken from us and you throw a little fit but that's okay you're still his Papa's just going to have to deal with you I've said this I don't mind a brat once in a while but I don't want want no spoiled rotten bread okay yeah oh you get away sometimes it's a little cute to watch their little brat attitude I remember the time just tell on Amos A Time Sandy made a cake this little guy he two three year old you know and he couldn't wait and he just reached over and he grabbed a handful of that cake and he ate it and it was he tried licking it off his fingers and it's around his mouth Sandy come in here oh my who got into the cape and it's so cute because you know what you're born to lie oh yeah he's got it evidence all over him Amos did you get into that cake no no it's so innocent you have to start laughing and then you whip the Tor no you just make you laugh right now but there are times when you laugh at it other times you say okay that's enough there are times God going to tell you he may laugh at a little something you do and another time he's going to say that's enough you know the difference I did it with God one time there on the beaches of San Diego yeah story yes sir I did it I was having a hard time with some issues in my own life and uh you know I got mad at God put my hands up there on the the beach in San Diego there and I said why why now boy I realized it was as though I knew that God stood up and I'm in trouble oh yeah yeah uh-huh and I thought oh oh yeah yeah he said you're going to step on a stingray I'm out surfing yeah you all know the story so I'm not going to tell it again anyway I stepped on one wow and God used that as a testimony to bring Mitch Buckingham in amen that's another story I do not have Alzheimer's I am telling this for a purpose okay stay with your notes Ron don't all right all right now remember now we just took Genesis 17 and whenever I look at the scriptures I always like to dissect it and looked at it because I know there is something very important going on and here God he has spoken to Abraham many times he's told him you're going to have a son I want you to sojourn in a land I want you to go and be a pilgrim and a stranger and he leaves his family and we see Abraham or let's call him Abram at the time is going in he's on his journey yes amen now he's gone through all kinds of things and I'm not going to rehearse all of that but he's a man that's familiar with the supernatural God deals with him by way of Revelation and God speaks to him I want all of you to start asking God for more Revelation because it is God's will to deal with you in Revelation that's what makes you different than those out here otherwise you'd be in a Catholic Church you'd be in a Baptist Church you'd be out there you'd be somewhere sitting on a bar stool you'd be doing something else or serving your own God but God rich in Mercy has seen fit Amen to call you to come out of that nonsense so every time that God Appears he does it for a purpose amen amen so I want you to stop there for a moment and think God's dealing with Abraham but Abraham has now I'm going to turn back here for just a moment and I catch inspiration off his scripture amen thank you Lord he's 99 years old yeah right and the Lord appears to him and he tells him I'm almighty God now all of this is for a purpose amen God's appearing have a purpose God's revealings to you have a purpose am and every time that God gives you understanding when he gives you Revelation it's for a purpose the lion and the bear was for a purpose because there would be a Goliath and he would say the same God watch this he was taking his track record and backing up oh I remember the lion oh I remember the bear I remember that the same God that delivered me back then is the same God that will deliver you you big uncircumcised philistine Hallelujah you come against me with sword and spear I come against you in the name of the god of Israel amen Abraham was experiencing the word appear I want you to understand this the word appear in Hebrew is RA r a a and God appeared raw and it means to see to discern or to experience yes and the last definition means to catch the vision Beau amen amen amen oh my God would you appear Amen to someone here this morning yeah to make him go Beyond Hallelujah them seeing rules and regulations yeah amen and church order beond and what we've got to do and the because some have just seen the rules may you appear to them yeah amen and may your heavenly father cause you to turn amen and he'll come running when God runs amen hallelujah praise the Lord Abraham let me say this was Experiencing God Amen he was Discerning God he was catching the vision of God Amen God Appears to us through prophetic Ministry in our day we call it the message of the hour but he's doing it for a purpose am amen he's not just making you a church member he's not making you religious I can't stand religious people amen a message without Revelation turns to religion [Music] makes Creeds dogmas traditions of man so we can see God does everything for a purpose now in Acts 26: 15-8 we're going to see God calling Saul remember Saul on his high horse he's been persecuting all of the Christians throwing them in prison and then God appears to an ananas and tells him I want you to go and pray lay hands on Saul he says um excuse me did did you say Saul Saul of Tarsus Saul the one who's killing him now that to Hey listen of everybody in the scripture I think that guy had the hardest task huh probably told his wife and kids adios Noosa just I ain't coming back man because what if this what if it's a false Revelation anyway he goes there and right he's got to pray for him right now watch here it is here's the reason acts 26:1 15 and I said who art thou Lord now only a prophet caught this he said here is a Pharisee who's taught to not just call anything Lord he said this is Supernatural there's a presence here amen who are thou Lord he said I am Jesus yeah I'm sure that blew his mind Jesus this is the heretic that these cult guys are following I am Jesus he might have could have be able to understand if he said I'm Jehovah Gyra he could have said okay but he said I'm Jesus watch whom thou persecutest now arise so now he's got to get into action rise stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou Hast seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee in other words not only what you're catching now what you will catch amen amen amen all of you know for a fact fact you take your own life as a witness God Appears to you as a young man God Appears to you as a young woman praise God and you start walking then he appears to you about your dress then he appears to you about this and he appears to you about that and there's one appearing after another it wasn't man that told you all this stuff it was God God appearing to you God speaking to you and you saying yes Lord thank you Lord when we came into this message and we didn't know no preachers it was every time we turned on a tape we learned something new because we didn't know amen we didn't know the way up is down right we didn't know that you should be humble right we didn't know that you don't dress in all the fancy clothes and this and that and we we were quite fashionable as young men especially my twin brother and I would just wear his clothes but when we came into the message and brother Brown said you know Don't Take Your Fashion out of Hollywood take it out of the word wow the Way Up Is Down we wondered should we comb our hair this will make you sick should we brush our teeth yeah and so we started shopping at Goodwill yeah we'd go to Goodwill yeah are these baggy enough yeah do I look pretty humble yeah you're humble Ron if I was a girl I'd never look at you buddy that's good yeah I'm humble man I remember Mitch he with there was we went into I think it was an Army Surplus store and they had some flight deck shoes flight deck shoes from off of uh the deck of aircraft carrier or something and they were really hard rubber souls and they didn't have them in Mitch's size but he said they were two sizes too big you ever seen kids wor shoes too big for him anyway the T the toe starts to curl up he wore those things around toes curled up and everything like that he actually wore them out I never thought you could wear those flight deck shoes wear them out but he wore them out but that was just how we were I want you to know if I'm going to say this to all of our young sisters and young men right now if you will lay yourself before God and you will ask him what kind of clothes you should wear that would be pleasing to him amen let him tell you because I'll tell you I am I am very much concerned seeing Hollywood dress coming back into I'm even talking on the guys I don't want skinny jeans I don't want a message Mohawk haircut oo that hit yeah and you sisters ought to be saying amen you never preach against the boys it's always as girls well yeah I I'm concerned so you guys I'm watching you okay take your take your lifestyle from a life that is found on your knees when you humble yourself and say father show me yes what is pleasing to you you sisters the same way high heel shoes skin down wieners he uses all those words that's a Kentucky hillbilly talking about formfitting dresses and I see it coming more and more brother Brenham I will reiterate it is not on tape it is what brother Billy Paul told me and again I'm going to tell you it's a it is his testimony he says Daddy call me up one time you young sisters listen to this he says Daddy call me up one time he said Billy get the girls together that meant Billy's wife Lois ma Rebecca and Sarah get them together I got thus sayith the Lord now sat the girls down and he said now you know Daddy doesn't think that a a Christian virtuous woman should wear long high heels he says and every time they preach it you all come home you throw them away month or two later you go and you get them you buy them again he said you know what I've told you for the last time he said if you go and do it again he said now the blood's upon your your own head yeah I won't tell you again now imagine if you was there in that room with your daddy and you know he's a prophet now I'm not here to try to standardize everybody but I will tell you what he said and that is don't wear those high heel shoes right amen amen amen is that okay with you guys amen because every time that he sees a vision of the Bride I want to ask you how' she look huh how was she dressed how does she the manner of her virtues and of her characteristic how is she God help us so here I am I'm an old time 71y old pastor preaching to a church that all hell is breaking loose and everything all it's full the the hey full stop has been pulled out everything in this media and on your cell phone and in the television and the movies and the internet and the radio and the fashion and all of this everything around in this Eden is to deceive you and he said in our young girls he said sitting there looking at those Billboards he said looking at those movies and those people slopping and kissing and hugging on one another he said it's degrading the morals of America where will we be tomorrow and you are facing it right now the moral decay in America brother Brenham says watch let's take it years ago it used to be your great grandmam was a flapper he said then it went another generation and it became a chorus girl or a chorus girl flapper I forget and then he said down to a strip teas and he says where will it go we are to the place to where the morality and the thinking of quote normal normal people scare me the grandpas at fry Supermarket are the ones with the long hair and the ponytail come on and the Grandma's got the short pink hair wearing men's clothing this is why why and if we don't apply the token saints of God you're not going amen that's right what is brother Brenham said again I I'm taking my time here excuse me I'm on page two but I got 17 Pages go for it amen because I as a pastor sometimes I'm overwhelmed I say oh God I don't want this job no more and people just think I'm some old crank I'm just trying to you know beat down on the girls and the guys and know can't you just give us a break why don't you just back off a little bit I remember my twin brother and I went to my high school again yeah I'm going to tell a story went to back to our high school and I don't think it was for reunion time my parents lived where I went to high school we went back to visit our parents cuz our parents were sick so I went there so my brother said um let's go over here to uh uh little Sizzler Steakhouse and we were there in Sizzler Steakhouse and you have to wait in line to go order your food then you get a number you go sit down they bring it to you my brother's backslid got his long hair got his nice silk shirt got his shirt opened tan cool dude and we're standing in line we're getting ready to order and a girl Taps us on the shoulder and said uh talk to my brother I said are you are you are you one of the twins are are yeah are you one of the Peterson twins I was two years younger you than you in high school so we were seniors they were sophomores and said oh man we remember you guys yeah and says so what are you know what are you guys doing and she says and where's Ron I'm standing right next to him here's cool dude and here's uncool dude and it's so funny my brother snickered cuz she says well where's your brother well he's right here and she looks at me and she goes oh oh well he he looks so and you look so I said yeah I know little death to S right cuz when you come to Christ he B you to come and die he said the life that I give you I will give it to you more abundantly but you got to take up your cross and follow him so my brother he kind of she went off she that whatever ended the conversation and I my right just indignation started to get a little and he says yeah yeah I says I look so normal that's what she said you look so normal so praise God I did I said yeah praise God for normal I said I can't wait now I start I get on my little soap box and I got a loud voice anyway I says I can't wait for God to burn this Sodom condition these bunch of pre rted people around you know and I get know and my brother okay man cool it you know look it's okay yeah I said he's going to burn this place off like Sodom and gomorra and oh man I just want that's okay it's okay now why did God give Abraham a covenant he said this Covenant is between me and thee thank and in fact in Genesis 17:15 it's the first time in mentioning the Covenant that Sarah is mentioned every other time the promise Sarah's never mentioned I'm going to give you seed but so now he's seeing the Covenant includes Abram and Sarah yeah and you're you're going to have a son right so it's a it's a covenant and the Covenant and I will give unto you a sign and that sign shall be circumcision is that right it is a sign between me and you that I have accepted your faith amen and I am sealing you yeah because now watch this cuz brother Brenham tells us circumcision of the Old Testament is the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the new now I'm not going to hold you much longer and I'm not going to go off here too much right now but I want to say this brother Brenham said of all the sermons I preached he said the Capstone one of all the sermons I've preached of 1,400 sermons does anyone know the name token the token he said if I ever preached anything inspired it was the token he said because without the token you ain't getting out of here he said that's what makes the difference between foolish and wise have you received very serious now only you can answer this have you received the Seal of God do you know you have the Holy Ghost has he sealed you to the day of your Redemption because without it you'll stay here with your long hair and your long dress because the long hair and the long dress without a revelation to do that is only religion it's vain worship amen amen so I'm going to give you a quote and then we're going to close musicans go ahead and come yes I I feel I've my battery's okay is that okay with you guys somebody asked me brother Ron how how are you feeling I said I'm getting better if I were to tell you at what percentage right now I say I'm about 90 I'm just kind of hitting the 90 like that okay you guys understand that and uh I can't take the cold much right now I don't have much of a appetite though Sandy is very nicely trying to like she did when we first got married she some going fatten you up I told her please not to the point I was before because I've got th this is nice this is nice man I'm wearing suits I haven't wore in 20 years the Lord she says honey I have skinny suits I have medium suits and I have fat suits I like it Freddy I can button this yeah kind to enjoy it so Sandy take it easy a little bit I'm going to give you this last quote and then I I'll have brother Robert to come in the sermon the Perfection 1957 what is it oh God requires Perfection he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him but he's looking to to tonight no how much no matter how much you've sinned how little or how much you're still a sinner you cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ God's all sufficient sacrifice amen what if it had not been for a place called Mount Calvary thank you Lord and in him you are perfected together forever thank you think of it it's not nothing you [Music] do it's it's not new pages you turn it's not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and by God's grace to you that brings you to Perfection and then you are perfected in Jesus Christ now I'm going to launch on off onto that in the next I got several sermons here we're going to look into [Music] it I want all of you to understand what we do is because of faith and faith is given to you by God's grace because by grace are you saved through faith and that being not of yourselves it is not of work but it is God's grace that gave it to you and so if any of us ever make Heaven our home it's because we were in Christ Hallelujah and because he cannot forsake himself yes that's true so our Perfection is through our sacrifice amen and if he requires us to be perfect God you would be an unjust God if you required something that I could not contain or attain to so you got to make a way because my righteousness is as filthy rats for all of sin and come short of the glory of God but the grace of God amen amen [Music] wow we take this message my brother and we dissect it down we we realize it's nothing but God's grace to us we weren't looking for it we weren't out praying and seeking there might have been a few that were looking for it but this message came looking for you and he says in every predestinated seat every elect seed everyone that is ordained of God will hear and when they hear they will be quickened and when they are quickened they are energized when they are energized they put into manifestation that which they see and if they don't see it they can't manifest that's right that's right it's amazing is this is the song I wanted them to sing and I I like that thank you you making that what you did you chose a song that's on my heart right now
