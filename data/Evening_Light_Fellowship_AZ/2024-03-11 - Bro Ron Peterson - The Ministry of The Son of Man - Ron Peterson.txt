ourselves without you we we will never make Heaven our home but you the great mediator our Kinsman our Boaz Our Redeemer ha come and made a way father that we could go and be with you I'm asking heavenly father to Jesus Lord that you would come by way of the Holy Spirit Lord anoint the word I lay my hands upon it right now Lord I take it I hold it to my bosom I ask you father to come and speak to our hearts Lord as only you can open our eyes of understanding how can we love a God who we do not know how can we serve a God who we do not understand therefore give us with all of our

uh for you Oscar and uh brother Steven mcney if you will uh take the baptismal service for us today I would greatly appreciate that amen it's been refreshing with the rain the last couple of days uh it certainly is a blessing to us here in the desert when we get some rain it's amazing I we get rain for Just 2 3 days and after 3 days I'm ready for Sunshine but I do not I do not want the summer to come on too quickly so thank the Lord for the rain cools it off a little bit hold back that summer until September and and we'll be good amen my brother came to me yesterday he the prostate cancer has uh shown up again uh the doctors have said uh for him to do chemo and hormone treatment he said uh which he has done before and he said um if I don't do anything uh how long and the doctor said well you have about 8 months and so he came to me yesterday he said I am doing no chemo I am doing no hormone my life is in God's hands and I agree with him I say hey uh we know our days are numbered huh and everything and uh I believe the coming of the Lord is so soon he may not die of any of that we all may go home and be with the Lord before that I believe the coming of the Lord is so very very close now let me say this I know you're all standing but just because you've been raised up around or associated with this message does not mean that you catch the Revelation contained within the message some of the children raised up in the message have got to understand they are taught principles doctrines um maybe in their eyes without having a revelation from Christ himself it may look a little legalistic but Jesus says if you love me you keep my Commandments it's not the keeping of the law but it's because of love and our love towards Christ um and so uh today I am going to be answering some questions that were given to me they were put on my desk here um a few weeks ago and uh I would like all of you to just remain standing and turn with me in your Bibles to St John chap 12 and we'll read verses 12 excuse me 32 through 34 so turn to St John 12 32 through 34 and if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto me this he said signifying what death he should die the people answered him we have heard out of the law that Christ abideth forever how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man may God add that blessing to the reading of his word you all may be seated this morning in the presence of God very good question who is this son of man we realize that we've had a revealing of the son of man in this last day but just because he has come he has spoke we have God's word on tape recording as far as as the revealing in this hour we've got it in book form that doesn't mean you'll get it unless the Holy Spirit reveals it to you none of you are exempt from that amen so Matthew chapter 16 then we'll go to Luke chap 9 Matthew 16 vers 13 through 17 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples who do men say that I the son of man am he's asking a question who do men yeah say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah are one of the prophets so now these are all speculation according to carnal understanding corre and he saith unto Peter but whom say ye that I am amen right yes and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it to you but none but my Father which is in heaven where does revelation come from your father in heaven doesn't come from your pastor doesn't come from your parents let me say this it doesn't come from the Prophet come on brother it comes to you by way of God himself Revelation is god making his word known to you and Upon This Rock I will build my [Applause] church that's right Luke 9 verses 18- 21 just another Viewpoint of Christ asking the same question but it's answered just a little bit differently and from there I wish to launch out this morning thank you Lord Luke 9:18 and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying who say the people that I am and they answering said John the Baptist some say Elias and others say that one of the prophets is risen again and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Peter answering said the Christ of god wow heavenly father now as we have read Thy word yes surely we could ask this same question again today and here among our people and due to Revelation or without Revelation or by understanding or without understanding I'm sure that we would get a multitude of different answers but father we ask heavenly father that you will open unto us our understanding of who is the son of man I ask it For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen I would like to title my Min the sermon this morning the ministry of the son of man amen he had a Ministry he had a mission he says I did not come to reveal myself I came to reveal my father I come to do his will he says I have a purpose of what I am doing so we're looking at the sermon titled the ministry of the son of man and the subject is who is the son of man and we're going to do questions and answers this morning I was given a couple weeks ago this yellow piece of paper on my desk we have eight questions my wife came to me this morning she said honey we've got to go and I was just wildly typing away at 32 words per minute and uh she said and I said oh my time has just gotten away from me have any of you ever got got into something and it's so intriguing and the word is opening and opening and opening and and all of a sudden time just seems to go by and where did it go and normally I like to be here an hour before church and and uh um we were late and uh uh everything but I very quickly then finished what I was just having some thoughts on and then I had to cut and paste all of my notes and send it to the Brethren and everything so I pray that this will be a blessing to you and perhaps answer some questions that you have concerning what is the revealing of the son of man and who is this son of man uh so I wish to expound on this now for the next 45 minutes to an hour now the word or the phrase the son of man is is used within your Bible 196 times it has been used in the Old Testament to describe a prophet a Seer a man sent from God yes sir and you will find that the most of the time when it says son of man in the old test Testament the sentence just preceding that son of man phrase it says the word of the Lord came unto the prophet son of man prophesy I want you to understand that actually when you take it back to the original Hebrew and you see in the word of the Lord came to the prophet it actually means the word of the Lord became the prophet Amen in other words he was so Anointed with the spirit of God this anointing that was upon him he now did speak and became the mouthpiece of God and many times he didn't understand what he was saying he didn't understand that many times after they got done they were perplexed in themselves what time and what is this prophecy when is this going to come to pass and so in the Book of Ezekiel alone Ezekiel in the Old Testament over 90 times does he speak to Ezekiel oh son of man more than any other book in the Old Testament let me show you a few examples here in Ezekiel chapter 3: 16 it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the Lord came unto me now here is an anointing coming on a prophet of God and this anointing is bringing to him thought the thought is not his thought but God is quickening to him a thought something that God wants Ezekiel to speak and he says saying son of man I have made thee a Watchman under the house of Israel so we realize that he as a Watchman God is going to have him set on the wall and to watch over Israel brother brenon preaches the sermon Watchman what of the night Verse 18 when I say unto the wicked now he's speaking through this anointing to Ezekiel when I speak or when I say unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die and thou giveth him not warning he's talking now to Ezekiel if you don't warn him if I say to the wicked you're going to die and you don't warn him nor speak us to warn the wicked from his his Wicked way to save his life the same the wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand what a great responsibility a Watchman has what a Shepherd has what a preacher has because I can tell you by the word of God none of you will actually be held accountable for me but I will be held accountable to all of you of what I tell you that makes me fear and tremble realizing that I do not want any one of you on the day of judgment to be able to put your finger in my face and said you never told me about about that you never warned me why didn't you tell me I would have repented so what a responsibility we have I'm not here to try to become everybody's golfing partner and friend Paul said I'd rather be a friend to Christ and an enemy to man so what I'm saying I say to you in the fear of God right amen verse 19 yet have thou warned the wicked and he turned not from his wickedness nor from his Wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou Hast delivered thy Soul so I'm delivering my soul this morning because I'm going to tell you what he said Ezekiel 13 and veres 1-3 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own Hearts hear ye the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord God woe unto those foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing now I just giving you uh a couple examples out of 90 examples just in the book of eek eel so I want you to understand um and show you some things from the message of the hour because the message of the hour when God sends a prophet in this hour what he does he gives the prophet an understanding from scripture and then when he preaches on that scripture he identif ifies that scripture and makes it known amen now we've had our Bible we've had the word of God but men with their own understanding have put their own interpretation to it divided it taken what they want what they don't want and that's the reason we have so many divisions Among Us so many denominations but God knowing that he will judge the world according to the word because the word of God is his absolute can we say Amen to that his word will never pass away that's right so uh the anointing that was upon Ezekiel I want you to understand this and listen carefully what I'm saying the anointing that was upon Ezekiel and the word of the Lord that came to him saying I want you to understand that was the Christ of God not Jesus that was the man the mediator the Kinsman but the Christ of God who do they say that I the son of man am well they said Jeremiah Ezekiel one of the prophets John the Baptist they all got all their but who do you say that I am do you really know who I am and then there was Peter who began to catch something and like a little student who knows the answer to the question in the classroom ask me ask me Peter who do you say that I am he said Thou Art the Christ of God amen amen do you understand they had the word but now for the first time they had an anointing and the anointing on that word made him the Messiah come and see is this not he the Messiah the Christ that has been prophesied is this not the anointed one that would come and explain to us and bring us back to the Faith of Our Fathers bring us back to what God's word says not what man says what God's word says that's what prophets do that's right they bring you back to what God's word says amen praise God amen amen a prophet is none other than the mouthpiece of Goden they are an oracle they speak what God anoints to them amen now let me show you in what is a vision because I now take the message of the hour spoken as from a prophet in this hour to clarify about a son of man so in the sermon what is a vision in 56 now I'm not comparing myself with a prophet no sir no no uh I'm just a poor sinner saved by grace but the gift that the lord gave the prophets and made them prophets they were God's mouthpiece Now understand they were they were not chosen by man they were chosen by God they had the word of the Lord and no Prophet ever did do anything just upon his own desire he did it first after God had told him that's right amen I only do as the father shows me that's right it only has to come through Divine powers to reveal through flesh and Christ was God's mouthpiece on Earth everybody understand that so we're talking about it's a divine power what is revelation to you divine understanding and that Divine understanding brings you power if this knowledge or understanding does not bring to [Applause] you power that changes your life it's just head knowledge it's just teaching it's just the Commandments it's just the law but when Revelation strikes that seed amen what it does it brings to them under ah wow yes ah is one of those aha moments and there are so many that I see even while I'm preaching people who have been around for a while who has heard the message of the hour perhaps it's a child who's been raised in this message and all it was was Creeds and dogmas and and teachings and all of a sudden wow I never understood that what is that that is not brother Ron that is not my teaching what it is is God is quickening his word and thoughts are coming direct to you and you have a revelation that comes from God and that is given to you through faith and faith is a gift not of works you didn't earn it right you are saved by grace through faith and that being a gift of God and not of Works lest any man should boast so God had to come through divine power Revelation and reveal it through F through flesh God uses man because God is God uses man as his instrument since the beginning of time when God needed something to be done God sent a man when he needed somebody to till the garden God sent Adam a man when God needed to correct a whole nation God sent a man when God needed to do away with sin he sent a man the man Christ Jesus so that's the instrument that God uses and yet so much of the time we misunderstand brother Bram said it's so hard for us to believe one another oh oh that's just brother Ron that that's just him he just said that that well if you would understand really what God is doing behind this Pulpit right now you might have the windows of Heaven open to you and you you realize oh my God this is a dreadful place this is none other than bethl the house of God so improving his word 64 and the son of man is revealing himself in this same power that he was not down through the church ages through justification sanctification all the things here but the son of man who is the son of man the word word is quicker powerful deerns the thoughts that's in the heart what did he have to do he has to prove that word notice of it when it was happening look at it in the same form he was here in the beginning the pillar of fire amen my proving that Hebrews 13 and8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever what was it Jesus Christ the same yesterday that was Christ that was in the wilderness with [Applause] Moses who was it it was Christ how many knows the Bible said that yesterday that was Christ when Paul was teaching here today you believe that in the New Testament who was it in the days of Paul who was it in Paul it was Christ then the son of man the same Christ in the last day who is this son of man it's Christ the word of the Lord comes to the prophets amen the Christ of God is what caused all of the Old Testament prophets and Saints of old to act out their part that God wrote of them in the word I want you to understand this is none other than a great drama in the beginning scene one enter Adam enter Eve that's scene one any of you ever been in a play paid a part in a played a part in a play you have to know your lines you have to play your part you have to know what scene you're in you have to know what age you're in otherwise if you don't know who you are and what part you play you can identify yourself in the play in The Script where do you belong in this great drama yes sir God wrote this great drama and he put it out there in scene one all this right down into scene 22 in the Book of Revelation now so I want you to understand what caused all of them to play their part was the Christ of God anointing them to speak and to act amen and to do the things that they did amen you imagine here's Noah just going along he just old Noah doing his thing he might be out because he he works with wood and he's going to work with wood for 120 years so maybe he's doing Noah Noah who's calling me God coming down making himself known speaking to Noah as it was in the days of Noah I want to ask you how many people in the days of Noah got thus sayith the Lord build an ark huh one you mean to tell me that God judge the whole world by the revelation of one man repent get in the ark it's going to rain as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be is it so strange that God would send one a prophet in this age and judge the whole [Applause] world he's the same yes yesterday today and forever Hall it was Christ in David it didn't say Jesus was in David it said the Christ was in him and it was the Christ in him making him say and do and act all the things that he was doing Paul picks it up in Galatians I speak to you this all the time Galatians 2 and 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God it's no longer I that live but Christ that liveth in me it's not me doing the works it's him amen amen this is the great mystery my now remember Christ is the mystery of God revealed without Christ you do not know God for Jesus said no man knows the father except through the son and whom he will reveal it that's correct Christ Christ let's all say the word Christ is the mystery of God revealed amen amen he's the identified Christ of all ages yes so when you understand who is this son of man what does he do what are the works how did he do back then what will he do today amen who is this son of man on how can I know him Colossians 1: 25- 28 wherefore I am me to minister according to the dispensation of of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but in now is made manifest to his Saints so the Revelation kept coming coming coming ding ding ding ding ding and all of a sudden landed on you that he might make known to you the mystery now it's landed on everybody else and every other age and they played their part so I'm telling you unless you know who you are and this Revelation comes and Strikes you you're going to sit there void of Revelation and there'll be no manifestation because Revelation brings manifestation amen no Revelation no manifestation than to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the men the Gentiles what is this mystery Oscar you want to know why you want real true the only Bible way to be baptized what is the name of the Father and Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ that's the mystery being made known that's part of it hallelujah amen thank you Lord Matthew Mark Luke John stand there as guards over the book of Acts and unless you got the right password you don't enter in in the name of the Holy Roman Church let me enter [Music] in in the name name of the Holy Father in the name of the Holy son I adure Thee they just stand there sorry you don't pass all of a sudden you catch the Revelation what is the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost enter in to the book of Acts do you know do you know you are a book of Acts in progress yeah and the word of the Lord came to Robert McGary hallelujah amen and in that day he began to act out a word that was given to him now watch this we would see Jesus brother Brenham 62 that was Christ in David as a rejected King talk of Mount olives dethroned down there by his own people rejected King went up onto the hill and wept over Jerusalem and cried because he was a rejected King that same Spirit yeah in Christ wept over Jerusalem here's Jesus now with the spirit of Christ and said Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I would have hovered over you yeah as a hinder it was Christ in those people anointed ones coming up till the perfect anointed one come they was anointed but now the Holy Spirit has come which is Christ in spirit form Hallelujah God just changing his MK the god of of us Old Testament Jehovah it was too hard to be understood Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name the God above us now takes on a form of Flesh and becomes Emmanuel God With Us which was Jesus Christ and then Oh my he said I've got to go away but the Holy Spirit he said I will come unto you not another I will come unto you I'm going to change my form I'm going to come down from God Almighty into a form you can understand that you call the man Christ Jesus being interpreted God With Us not the second part of the godhead god with us then I'm going to change my form again praise the Lord and on the day of Pentecost when it was fully come and they were all in one mind in one Accord and there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind yes Lord and it filled amen the temple in which they were C and clothing tongues of fire sat upon each one of them I want you to understand that what God was doing that great Pillar of Fire God was separating he's giving you a portion he's giving you a portion sat upon each one of you see God taking the Holy Spirit do you know what the Holy Spirit does when he comes to you he shaves sharing a portion of himself the great Pillar of Fire he's sharing it so that you'll know your part Hallelujah and it sat upon each one of them and they began to magnify god with their own voices but here was all kinds of different speaking languages people they were there on that day and they all began to raise their hands the disciples as they spake as God gave them utterance and the Bible says and they said are these not galileans right how is it that we hear them speak in the language wherein we were born some of you from other countries I promise you if if you heard me speak your dialect from your country do you think you'd sit up and pay attention you better believe if I spoke fluid Spanish Burundi kahili amen and you heard me speak it in your language how be it that we all elamites parthians and he names all these different languages we hear them all in the language wherein we were born God did not change the tongue he chained the ear do you see what the Holy Spirit does he comes down and he makes his word known to you by changing your ear he that hath an ear yes sir Hallelujah that's the truth let him here what the spirit that's it praise God proving his word 65 when he was on Earth here the first first time he was a son of man he could not be Son of God then he never claimed to be did you know Jesus in all the New Testament never said I'm the Son of God he said I'm the son of man who is this son of man yes sir amen yes sir he said Son of Man wouldn't anybody would question him he said you see the son of man son of man now son of man is a prophet he had to come that way because the scripture he could not come contrary to the scripture paragraph 129 now we find out in this man he had to be a prophet not Son of God there he had to be son of man Jehovah himself called the prophets Jeremiah and them son of man yes when you see the son of man who is the son of man they kept asking right we're asking the same question today who is this son of man to our children who is the son of man was William brandham the son of man come who is it tell me that I that I'll know who to follow yeah because I'll tell you I want all of you to understand this I'm going to say this and I trust it does not offend you we are not following the words of a man that's correct we are following thus say the Lord a message that came through a son of man but because of the veil many people are stumbled by it yes sir come on amen that's brother RM said one of the hardest things that God can get us to do is to believe one human to another amen now watch this loudy see in church age the Baptists have their Creeds and dogmas based on the word and you can't shake them amen what is their Doctrine based on the word and you can't shake them they say the apostolic days of Miracles are over and there's no baptism with the Holy Ghost subsequent to believing the methodists say based on the word there is no water baptism sprinkling is not baptism and that sanctification is the baptism with the Holy Ghost Church of Christ majors and regeneration B baptism all to many cases they go down dry Sinners and come up wet ones right yet they claim their Doctrine is word based come on go right down the line to the Pentecostals do they have the word give them the word test you see they will sell out the word for a sensation just about every time if you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and other signs whether the word or not or whether properly identified from the word the majority will fall for it tradition yeah so at the end of this age I am spewing you out of my mouth it's all over amen I'm going to speak all right yes I am here in the midst of the church the amen of God faithful and true will reveal himself and it will be by my Prophet thank you Lord he quotes Revelations 10:7 there it is he's sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years that's right he's sending someone who is so far from organization education and the world of religion that as John the Baptist and the Elijah of old he will hear only from God and he will have thus saith the Lord and speak for God praise God he will be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect in the last days and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day Hallelujah will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord hallelujah and be his body and be his voice and perform his [Applause] works somebody say Amen to this amen loud you see in church age paragraph 340 the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouthpiece amen so God is turning on her and he will conf found her through the prophet should I keep reading yes through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God yes sir will be in her it didn't stop at Revelations 10:7 it goes to Revelations 108 John take the book Hallelujah do you realize my brother my sister and John took the book look why because thou must prophesy the spirit and the bride are saying the same thingu same voice same message different mask God in [Applause] morit the Lord hallelujah Spirit and the bride say come amen amen once more the world the world will hear directly from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as it was in the first age sure has to be give me a I will give you a Bible trivia right now the son of man is used only 75 times in the New Testament Matthew Mark Luke John 30 times Matthew 25 Luke 15 and 12 I believe so many 75 times in the old in the New Testament except for one time in the book of Acts and two times in the Book of Revelation rest of the time it doesn't really talk about the son of man but who is his son of man Jesus is asking asking the question who do they say that I the son of man am right Peter had to answer Thou Art the Christ of God sh Peter do you know that two verses later he says and he commanded them to tell this to no [Music] man if they don't catch it shut your mouth can't you see it can't you see it come on man huh you can't make anybody see it neither can you keep it from the elect from seeing because when they see it huh their eyes come open they realize it's him remember the two on the road to emus there he was Christ the Resurrected Lord walking with two that knew him his disciples and the Bible says and eyes were were held back that they didn't know him they say he he joins himself to him invisible Union good why are you so sad and so downtrod well haven't you been here in Jerusalem haven't you heard this same Jesus whom we beli that was Messiah they have crucified him we laid him in a tomb and it's all over we thought this was him they wept and moaned and cried and so he began to expound the scriptures beginning in the book of Moses on and so for so many furlongs he begins to you ever walk with somebody and as you walk along all of a sudden you want to make a point and you stop now now now now here's what I'm trying to say right okay you make your point you keep walking along I got another point you stop every you see what I'm saying you do that all the time that's what Jesus did he kept taking the scriptures concerning himself and all they got was heartburn did not our hearts burn within us as he spake to us along the way but the Bible says they compelled him to stay with them for the day was Far spent it's evening time it shall be light about the evening time the path to Glory you shall surely find the day was fars bent and they compelled him stay here with us and Jesus the Bible says made as though he would go further no I don't really have time no now they didn't say okay go ahead and go you can tell when somebody you know it's like you're paying for a meal and somebody else says let me pay for the meal you say no I got it they said no no let me pay for the meal and then they you pass them over the bill and and they choke he made his though he go further and they said no stay here with us and the scripture says and he sat at meet with them in the evening Jesus said I am the bread which came down from heaven now the Bible says he took the bread and he break it now watch the symbol form he broke the bread and their eyes came open am what was he breaking the word on it's him it was him all the whole [Applause] time you know what he did he stepped back into that Supernatural realm he stepped back to where they couldn't see him you know what God does with you throughout your whole lifetime you're just going along doing your own thing and he steps out and he goes [Music] peekaboo and he reveals maybe you're doing the dishes maybe you're listening to a sermon maybe you're driving your car maybe you're going to school and you're thinking on these things and as you do all of a sudden and you go oh wow wow that oh my where' that come from I tell you where it came from it was a lightning bow out of Heaven that your father sent to you let me tell you some of you got mail you ain't reading oh mying binging binging oh I'll get it later way come on brother come you know something about all of this email and text messaging and all of this WiFi and under the cloud because if you if you ain't got reception yeah you ain't got nothing hello hello can you hear me now oh look I look I got one little measly bar right no 5G no one G nothing man I Ain hey you know what I got to be under the footprint somewhere right I got to be under This Cloud somewhere and if I can get under the cloud if I get somewhere close enough to it I'm going to begin to catch something am you realize that's what you need to do is sensitize your spirit you're too Carly minded you don't get on your knees and pray you don't seek the mind of God therefore you're not [Applause] sensitized what are you expecting are you expecting your donkey to talk to you come on why are you yeah give this goofy donkey you've always done what I told you to do he turns around tell you k you see there's an angel right there you dumb idiot what come on some of you what are you expecting God trying to get your attention you think he's going to slap you up beind the head knock you down throw you in the dirt rough you up a little bit listen to me listen to me it might be a small still voice amen excuse me Luke 19: 9 and 10 and Jesus said unto him the day of salvation this day is salvation come into this house for as much as also he also is the son of Abraham for the son of man here's his purpose is to come and to seek and to save that which was lost Now understand something you have to have possession of something before you say you lost it yeah you have to have possession of something before it can be lost let me expound on this for a moment because the prophetic Ministry is a son of man ministry that's right God is changing his form so that not everyone will recognize him only the elect in the unveiling of God brother brm says he came first as the prophet They Crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the the Holy Spirit came he was then Son of God brother Brenham said Christ fulfills three offices in his lifetime in dispensations Son of Man prophetic Ministry Son of God as a mediator between God and man right and then son of David sitting on the throne in the [Music] millennial then after the Holy Spirit he was then the Son of God God is Spirit he was the Holy Spirit Son of God he lived down through the church ages as Son of God now in the millennial he'll be the son of David sitting on the throne of his father David now watch this he is now the Son of God now and remember between Son of God and Son of David in the loudest inan Church age they put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed as the son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of the scriptures tie perfectly together son of man Son of God Son of David what is it it's the same God all the time yes just changing his form in morpha he just changed it it's a great drama to him he is acting it out his objective was to seek and to save that which was lost amen ain't saving everybody everybody ain't his that's right he does not correct those that are not his amen that's right the Bible says if you are without correction or chastisement you're illegitimate and God don't waste time on illegitimates do your thing right I didn't believe there was a God or never will be a god this and that yeah the Bible says the the fool has said in his heart there is no God you were born to be that fool yeah I I told you before and just say this I was working late at night because there was a jacket a box up in Flagstaff and we got the job to repair the ceiling in the Jack and a box and I had to do right over and it's open 24 hours they they cooking hamburgers and everything 24 hours so so I have to repair the ceiling right over that part uh of where they're cooking right over the grill so I'm up there I've got my tool pouches on my hammer and I'm putting up some drywall and Hammer and I'm whistling I'm just whistling and I'm whistling a Christian tune I don't remember what I was whistling but obviously the manager of Jack in the Box heard me and he heard me with and he come over to me he was at the base of my last and he said hey preacher how do you know as I'm a preacher hey preacher don't try to convert me I'm an atheist I don't believe there is a God I look down at him I'm on a six foot ladder got my hammer in my hand I come down hang on just a second I want to talk to you I come down and as I'm walking or getting down like that he's backing up I got to Hammer If I Had a Hammer anyway so I put my hammer in the pouch I said let me shake your hand you an atheist yes sir man I don't believe there is a God you couldn't you couldn't force me you couldn't make me believe and everything like that I said I ain't going to waste my time I said sir I said you were born to fry in hell like a piece of be I ain't going to waste my time you were born a son of predition am well I can go to church just like you I said going to church ain't never saved nobody right see it ain't going to church it saves you you think you're going to get in heaven because you got a star on your I went to evening Light Fellowship Sunday morning Wednesday evening I did Bible study open up you Gates I had perfect attendance no it ain't cuz you were in church you got to be having Church inside of you you got to have God inside of [Applause] you ain't going to church it's having a relationship with Jesus Christ huh all right let me just throw out something that I'm going to launch off into in the next sermon or two the within the son of man Ministry lies the title deed to your full inheritance yes sir yeah think about that just chew on that for a little bit remember the purpose of the son of man this is why I came to seek and to save that which was lost and all that the father hath given me oh just by chance you know you think God is up in heaven ringing his hands no thinking he's worried he's going to lose you as bad as you are and as carnal as you are and as unbelieving as you are God said I didn't call them because of their Works amen because their works stink right I didn't call them because of their Holiness because their righteousness is as filthy rags I called them because of election that before they were born neither having done good or evil I already set upon them a calling of election you had nothing to do with [Applause] it you had nothing to do with it it's All About Him Christ the mystery Christ down Through the Ages playing out his part in every age John 1:18 no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him declare in Greek means to reveal to make known am you don't even know God except you know him through Christ that is the father's business you know that yes sir Luke 2:9 and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wish you not that I must be about my father's business John 6:37 all that the father has given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will know no wise cast out I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me in this is the Father's will yes you want to know it this is the Father's will which has sent me that all which he hath given me I should lose nothing somebody say nothing NADA Nick new I don't care how you say it he he didn't lose none of them praise the Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord thou has given me a chance it's you holding me it's not me holding you it's not what I do it's what you have already done hallah my thank you Lord Wonder this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth a son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up in the last day amen all right questions I I ain't even got to the questions yet so they were written here on this I transferred them to this what does the son of man mean or stand for according to the word of God you see if you're asking what does the son of man mean according to the word of God then you go to the word of God so who do they say that I the son of a Man Out Peter answers it Thou Art the Christ of God so it's a Bible answer is it not right what does the Revelation or manifestation of the son of man mean in this day or in this age so you got two questions what does the revelation of the son of man mean in this age or what does the manifestation of the son of man mean Revelation precedes manifestation amen you got to have Revelation then you manifest and once Revelation comes to you it becomes the manifested sons of God in that age okay we understand that then what does this question number three what does the son of man revealing the son of man mean today so I got cuz brother Brenham said says and if you listen to it on tape he says and I'm going to show you some quotes here but if you listen to the tape they said brother Brenham are you the son of man he said no I'm a son of man revealing to you the somebody say the he didn't say thee he said the how do you spell the t h e they didn't spell it the way that he said it I am a son of man revealing to you the son of man I'm just a prophet revealing to you the god of the prophets the son of man who is the son of man Christ amen all right now here's questions answers 1964 some say brother Brenham is the son of man I thought the pillar of fire was the son of man am I mistaken well that's a good question very good but I am not the son of man but a son of man now I put the T he in there so i' emphasize it but brother brand says I am uh not the son of man but a son of man there's quite a difference I am not the anointed son of man I don't claim to be his Prophet many times I said I don't think I catch myself on tape but I say sometimes because I want to give the term a prophet the English term means a preacher anybody knows get a dictionary see a prophet is a preacher under English dictionary but under Hebrew or Greek a prophet is a sear one who foresees things for tells things under the English interpretation Prophet is a Seer so I don't call myself anything but your brother I am your brother I just and you just regard me as brother Bill or brother brandham whatever you want to do that uh to do that about that that's fine what you believe keep that to yourself questions answers I am not he I am his servant amen and the pillar of fire is not he it's the spirit form which was upon the son of man and he come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a Ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to come together wonderful so question number four how does the son of man reveal himself today as Abraham was in Luke 17:30 how does the son of man reveal himself today as it was with Abraham in the days of Luke 17:30 we we know Luke 17:30 but in the days of the revealing of the son of man so the same scenario watch this and we we we find the types and shadows within scriptures because as it was so shall it be as it was in the days of Noah gives us a pattern as it was in the days of Sodom gives us a pattern we can understand then by the pattern that we see the patterns all down through scripture they are types and shadows so we can understand the way that God reveals himself to Abraham and to Sarah it is an example of what God is going to do in this end time okay so uh God came down revealed himself to Abraham God had been speaking directly to Abraham about a promised seed remember Genesis 12 and God appeared unto Abraham and told him I'm I'm going to give you seed he's just a young man it's not until 25 years later and he's an old man and he's dead in body and Sarah's dead that God's going to Quicken the promise so we see our types and shadows I went a little fast threw that out there for just to get you thinking promise was given to Abraham but has to be produced or birthed through Sarah right so now God speaks to brother brandham as a prophet but it isn't until the Bride Comes to a maturity that she conceives the message or the word from the prophet she's got to be of age because she's been receiving seed since she's 16 brother Ram said Abraham married Sarah when she was 16 and giving her seed seed seed they had had relationships all these years and she was barren okay she was Barren now I'm going to throw something out here that I'm going to explain to you a little bit later he said now when God changes them back he goes farther than just changing them back to being young again because when they were young she still didn't conceive so there's there's got to be something that God does he gives his name he said you're not Abram you're Abra you're not Sarah you're brother Braham said name change is familiar to all of us and he does it either because of a change or produces a change so the change of producing it watch and you look at it in the scriptures oh I know I'm getting ahead of myself but this is fun this is fun I like that even after they've got the promise and they're as good as dead yeah yeah he said he says Abraham fear not I'm going to be with you my covenant's going to be with you amen I love it God just said hey don't be afraid listen my Covenant is with you but then now watch he has spoken about a promised seed to Abraham this whole time but she is Barren and it never includes her by name it always says my C it with you Abraham Abraham Abraham it's to you you you Abraham Abraham but now he says Sarah come on shall bring forth a seed is well that Ishmael might live he's 15 years old when Isaac is born right through a denominational Woman by the name of Hagar and and Sarah saw in ishmail mocking Isaac when he was being weaned how many of you know that in and she got so mad she says she Stomps right over to Abraham I'll tell you what Abraham Abraham I saw her mocking kick her out for the bondswoman shall not be air with the free woman the Shar shall not be air with the wheat that's right denominations got nothing to do with that Bride on do you see these in types amen okay I'm going to I'm going to elaborate on that in just a minute let's see where I'm at wow I got two minutes question number four or no this question number five who is the Angel sent to Abraham's seed Elohim to reveal the Sodom sign the oh excuse me excuse me question number five somebody say five five okay I'm on five now did the fullness of God dwell in William brandham to reveal the son of man to the bride no the fullness of God only dwelt in Jesus Christ we have a partial what is called the earnest or the down payment which is the holy spirit but at the first resurrection we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and then brother brandham said you will get the fullness of your adoption at the first resurrection and then I shall know him as he has known I shall be like him I don't know what it's going to be like when I get there all I know this I I will be like him God God who is the Angel this question say who is the Angel sent to Abraham's seed now I'm just reading it and they said Elohim to reveal the Sodom sign the prophet speaks of Billy Graham Oral Roberts and the third was through William Branham that Elohim reveal himself to the bride okay who is the Angel sent to Abraham's seed yes it is Abraham excuse me it is Elohim because when God comes to Abraham down in a form member in the plains of mammory comes down there are three men coming he says my Lord true Revelation remember lot sees the same group coming my lords false revelation yeah he says my Lord he sits down and eats flesh with them drinks milk and the two two Messengers went down to Sodom and he says that's a modern day Billy Graham and or Roberts right they were Deliverance angels to Sodom that's why he said I go and I preach and I get 40,000 converts and I come back next week and I can't find 40 they are messengers to Sodom are we together in that in fact brother Braham said this is the first age that he said that we have a messenger to the age that has the H at the end of his name he said Graham is six letters number of men he never did spell brandom did you know that no nowhere do you know in your seven Church age book he don't even put brandom in the seven Church age messenger it's a fill in amen so every one of us when we heard that I did the first time here I am just a kid a couple weeks in the message hey uh uh Graham six g r a h a m uh brandom b r a n h a who is this one am when my seven Church AES book brandom huh I want to ask you who gave you that Revelation do do all of you have that fill-in blank because somebody told you they gave you the answer did you look on somebody else's sheet huh like like in school hey what's the answer seven Church age messenger brand up you didn't find it by yourself somebody told you that's why even my grandkids I'll tell them you need it yourself that's right yeah you ain't going to get it cuz Grandpa got it you ain't going to get it cuz Mom and Dad got it you're going to get it cuz God has ordained it to you that's why I tell whether it be my grandkids or your grandkids or any of the kids here in the church Hey listen you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling and I'm not going to baby you if you say this message ain't for me I don't believe it then I ain't going to try to persuade you into it go be about your father's business sorry if it ain't for you it ain't for you I not judging you you're judging yourself do you follow me but if you are a prodigal oh yeah yeah if you are a son they just going to take all of your inheritance and you're going to live and right at this living you think this is living he's going to let you live with pigs Until you realize you don't belong there amen then you're going to say oh man I don't belong here I need to go back to my fathers why even the servants live better the Bible says and while he was yet a far off his father saw him but sin will hold you longer than you want to be held and take you farther than you want to go and the way back is going to be tough right it ain't going to be easy that's right you fought your way to get to the pig's pin now you're gonna fight your way back well I'm having it's so rough and I just said it's good for you well I'm a suffering persecution the righteous shall suffer persecution those that are Godly in Christ what shall suffer if you're not suffering persecution you're not living it right you're Living the Life of Christ well I ain't telling nobody yeah that's your problem you're ashamed of it if you're ashamed of him before men he'll be ashamed of you before his angels before huh amen Amen on so did the fullness of God dwell in brother brandom no fullness of God dwelt only in the in Jesus Christ CHR the angel he speaks through this angel speaks through the seven Church age messenger and he preaches what God tells him to say because remember it was God Elohim that met with Abraham he said oh it's the Lord Elohim right so here's the messenger coming to Abraham you see now without the revelation of the Holy Spirit you're not going to get it I can tell you this stuff we can declare it ever so eloquently or poorly however way you want to look at it but the Holy Spirit alone is a Divine revealer of the word in Christ The Mystery of God revealed let me give you a couple more quotes here and man yeah uh I will quit when I'm done the Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the divine revelation of Christ and has been in all ages amen it's the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost you see how important the Holy Ghost is yes you see why foolish virgin is foolish yeah cuz she's bride material but the reason she's foolish she got no oil she's got no Holy Spirit there's no Revelation loud see in church age without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never have your eyes open to spiritual revelation of the word a man without the spirit is blind to God and His truth you guys catch that question number eight Billy Graham Oral Roberts and brandham have left where are we in the scriptures very good question because that's the eschatology where are we man give me the timeline if we were to say in the timeline of laiaa and this and that where are we I mean if Oral Roberts and Billy Graham have come and brother Brenham has come the messenger and he comes at the end of the age then where are we well then we have to go back to the Book of Genesis and you look at Abraham I'm going to tell you and I'm not going to go back through all of this but I want you to do your homework watch this and I believe we are between Genesis 17 and Genesis 21 write that down and remember that God time means nothing to God A Day With God is as a thousand years so if it was in Abraham's life in 25 years transpires we go from Genesis 12 13 14 15 16 17 we go we see MDC we see God coming to him we see a name change and everything but what's really interesting and let me see here remember in Genesis CH 20 they're turned back is that right and yet in Genesis 19 it says and they were of old age so now God changes and turns them back and brother Ram says watch aimc looks at Sarah and says Oho I want her a 75-year-old woman with flab and wrinkles I mean come on aimc he's got a kingdom Sarah French say o la la I can't wait he brother Bram says there he is aimc he took his shower took his bath he got the oils on him man he got his hands behind his back he says ooo in the morning he said I'll watch his toes wiggle he says and then all of a sudden God says you return the man his wife or you're a dead man that's right yeah but Lord you know I didn't touch her yeah because I kept you from touching don't sit there and give me your little righteousness return this man let him and if he don't pray for you your whole Kingdom Satan your Kingdom's going down Satan your Kingdom's going down aimc your Kingdom's going down so he says okay man he goes ahead and he returns her to Abraham woo pray for me Abraham and ailec gives him gifts so watch she doesn't conceive seed bear with me now for just another they're turned back young in Genesis 21 Sarah conceives Isa she couldn't as an old dead woman who was Barren are we get amen so there had to be something that happened so in Genesis 21 Sarah conceives Isaac gives birth and Abraham weans Isaac and Ishmael mocks Isaac when he's 15 years old Isaac is 15 remember he was first born and remember it was Grievous unto Abraham he cries out oh that ishel might live thinking that's his seed and God said it ain't through denominational Hagar it's going to be through Sarah thy wife Hagar was never considered his wife in fact God had to to correct Abraham said let it not be Grievous unto you quit your whining Abraham yeah that's what he told let this not be Grievous it ain't going to be ishmail no see and so you find out that the Shucks not air with the wheat so somewhere between Genesis 17 onto where we are at right now of the promised seed because there's got to be a change before the promised son can come musicians if you come let me see did I answer Billy Graham Oral Roberts brandom have left us scene where we at in the scriptures I just showed you we could take even more time but I think if you go and you look in Genesis and start reading through you see how it transpires with him and when Abraham and Sarah were as good as dead that's when God performs his word y I want you to understand we we don't have to drum nothing up we don't have to get you emotional we don't have to get you excited we don't I don't have to get up here and scream and holler and Shout I believe in that I I I scream and holler and Shout at times amen we could have the music get you all emotional yeah [Music] or you just catch it in the Simplicity of the word and you go oh my you me to tell me that as God dealt with Abraham and he finally had to show Abraham Abraham is you got nothing to do with this Abraham I have made my Covenant with thee but watch now he says now and Sarah I have made a covenant with thee also yes that through thee Hallelujah yes you're going to bring forth the promised son amen the right one at the right time okay now watch this I'm not going to let you go without understanding this Sarah when she hears the angel say she's going to have a seed what does she do she laughs can I show you a couple quotes here before we go because brother Brenham says as Abraham and Sarah received their sign he said so will these in the last day receive the same sign here it is let me find what's the mark of the beast and seal of God 1961 the last sign was to be M the Messiah sign what was the last sign that Abraham just before Sodom burned you want to know where we're at you want to know what's the last sign before Sodom burned Angel stood there God himself in flesh who was it Elohim what took that haven't we Abraham called him Elohim God stood there a stranger and watch what he called Abraham called Abraham his new name he just got it in a few days before instead of Abram he was Abraham called Sarai her a princess name n Abraham where's your wife Sarah how do you know he was married how do you know he had a wife how do you know her name was Sarah said she's in the tent behind you and Sarah in her heart laughed and said I would ever have joy with my Lord seeing I'm old and pass a of bearing he's too old I'm too old he's too old an angel said why did Sarah laugh saying in her heart it just can't happen Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man who is this son of man what about the coming where are we at did you see the sign given to Abraham okay it wasn't so from the beginning 61 remember let me tell you thus sayith the spirit of God that's on me this is the last sign to the Gentile Church before the Rapture thus saith the word of God thus saith the holy spirit that speaks that knows The Secret of Heart thus sayith the Lord you're receiving your last call proving his word 65 remember Abraham's group never received one more sign from God until the promised son arrived how many knows that's true sign and discernment the Royal Seed of Abraham let me hear you let me tell you thus sayith the Lord you're receiving your last sign that's according to the scriptures the revelation of God that's in my heart it speaks that this is the truth I trust that you will believe it to be the truth Abraham's Grace Covenant 1961 I got one more quote and one more scripture what's the next thing after this sign goes away God's going to condition Abraham's children getting ready to receive the promised son you know what's happening right now you're being conditioned yes how we going to receive him we can't receive him in these bodies what's he doing the last sign before the Transfiguration the last sign before the Rapture for most any time the atomic bomb's going to destroy the world before it screams into the uh the tapes Jesus is coming we which are alive and remain shall not prevent and hinder them which are uh asleep dead for the Trump of God shall sound the dead and Christ shall rise we which are alive shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye old man will be young and old wom will be young again will be conditioned to meet the promised coming son Glory Hallelujah next thing in God's order God's conditioning you right now the next thing we're looking for is change in body in a moment in twinkling of an eye what happen just as the angel had his back turned and showing that sign to Abraham he brought everything down through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost placing of son's gifts and order come out and then showing his last sign Before Destruction where are we at brother Ron here we're at changed why do we have to be changed it's totally impossible for that old man to have sexual relationship with his wife it's totally impossible for her to conceive and bear a child it was only and the only way it could could be done would be have to be transformation of her body he had lived with since she was 18 years old or 16 his half sister he married her young she was Barren and he was sterile you see it so he had to change her physical being to receive the sun now in closing the Bible says Hebrews 11 through faith also Sarah herself receiv received strength amen to conceive seed amen who was delivered of a child when she was past age she didn't think she thought it was over I this is done L do you see it mine I'm too old the church we've been here man 63 the opening of the seals we've been here look oh man it's too late I'm too old the church is getting a little doesn't seem to have no more power anymore where's all the Miracles oh man we're looks like we're as good as dead yeah You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet the game ain't over till it's over because she judge him Faithful Is promise amen amen praise the Lord God bless you I I I trust that this was okay I didn't really preach I just kind of took some teaching here and some quotes because these were good questions very good question who is the son of man what is this message all about is it just church order have we condensed the prophet's message to long hair and a long dress is that it well our religion says is that what you young people say well our religion that's what it teaches us then you're no different than a hutterite or an Amish our religion says but did God ever speak to you I tell you what when I lha hippie out of Southern California dope smoking listening to rock and roll and surfing every day and thinking that was what life was all about and then God gets a hold of me and shakes me like a bulldog on a rag doll and I'm still shook up the longer that I serve God in this message the clearer it becomes amen not more obscure the clearer amen the questions that I even had as a young man I don't have anymore right I'm beyond I I I'm to the place where beyond the threshold threshold they say when the bombers during the second world war they had a threshold point of no return what was it point of no return point of no return I'm there I am there no returning if none go with me still will I follow amen you can't talk me out of it and you can't talk me into it amen that's right because if somebody talks you into into believing this somebody can talk you out of it that's right but if God reveals it to you guess what ain't no devil in hell ain't nothing going to shake you that's why you know what some of you young people yeah yeah you sit there and say well brother Ron I really don't know I I don't know if it's for me I yeah good good CU I don't know if it's for you either cuz you're going to have to get old enough to kind of make your own choice and when you make your own choice you say yeah well huh yeah brother brandom took that Infidel he took that Apple took the Apple off the tree he bit into it and he said is this sweet or sour and yeah the Infidel said how do I know I haven't eaten an apple he said neither have you tasted of the things of God then I ask you is this messy sweet or sour I don't know I ain't really ate of it well get to eating get to eating and find out for yourself yes amen you think God sends an angel and a pillar of fire and vindications thousands upon thousands of dust sayith the Lord not one of them you think he did it in a [Music] corner he S as Moses was given two signs you'll be given two son right he said if you get to people to believe nothing will stand in your way even cancer thank you Lord and you look at it as what is this message all about is it just church order no if that's all I teach you I want to quit tomorrow amen I have failed you miserably if that's all you got I failed you but a teacher I tell you all of you had teachers in school in college somewhere that all of you wanted to get in their class why because they were teachers and they inspired you to to [Music] learn I loved certain teachers that we had who said yeah you got a a on that test but it should have been an A+ you can do better huh had a had a history teacher she said I'm going to dress up as somebody that I've been teaching from history and I'm going to come out here and I'm just going to say one sentence it says and if you can't guess it then we're going to stay here in class but if you can guess it class dismissed she come out with a Roman tunic threw it around herself she said that's to [Music] Bry if you didn't know it you stayed in class you see but it inspired [Music] us this message so inspires
