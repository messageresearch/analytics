[3:51] specials before the song special and all

[4:58] hand. You know, uh, Brother Ron is is is
[5:02] 72 years old and, uh, and he still has a
[5:06] vision for the young people and um, and
[5:09] he's still relatable with the young
[5:11] people and that's something very special
[5:13] that we have at our church. God bless
[5:15] you, brother Ron. Sister Sandy, thank
[5:17] you for all of your efforts. We
[5:18] certainly appreciate it. Love you very
[5:20] much. And um uh James Loveval, he's
[5:23] probably not even in here. Where's he
[5:24] at? James, come here. Come
[5:28] here. Come on in here. Is it Mary or
[5:31] Martha? Which one was always serving?
[5:32] James, come on up here. Give James a
[5:35] hand.
[5:38] [Applause]
[5:45] Say a little something. Oh, I don't need
[5:48] We just trust you had a a good time at
[5:50] camp.
[5:52] You were truly blessed by the services
[5:55] and we trust that you just take what
[5:57] you've heard, what you've experienced
[5:59] home with
[6:00] you. The battle's
[6:03] raging. You've heard it from the
[6:05] ministers that you're called to a called
[6:06] to a battle. It's not going to be a
[6:08] picnic. It's not easy. You know, we come
[6:11] to camp, we're surrounded by one
[6:13] another. You get on a camp
[6:15] high, but whenever you go home, that's
[6:18] where it's going to
[6:20] hit. You come here, you make a stand for
[6:23] Christ, you stand on your experience,
[6:26] but when you go home, that's when the
[6:28] Satan's going to come. And whenever he
[6:31] tempts you, that's when you're going to
[6:33] overcome.
[6:35] You came here and you said, "I'm going
[6:36] to overcome. I overcame. my over. He's
[6:38] going to go back. When you go back, he's
[6:41] going to tempt you.
[6:43] And that's when you put everything that
[6:45] you've learned here into into action.
[6:50] And I do want to personally say thank
[6:52] you to all the counselors that have
[6:55] helped. There's some that have um made a
[6:59] greater sacrifice or a bigger step. And
[7:02] I would like to recognize Sister Ashlin.
[7:04] Give her a nice hand.
[7:07] She's done all the
[7:09] meals. There's a lot of organizing that
[7:12] goes behind the
[7:14] scenes. And I always say, young people,
[7:18] if it's for one life to be changed,
[7:20] I'd do it all
[7:22] again. Just for one life to be
[7:26] touched. You don't understand the
[7:29] eternal value of things that you've done
[7:31] here.
[7:34] We trust that you were blessed, that you
[7:36] go home, and that your parents notice
[7:39] that there's something different about
[7:41] you. When they ask you, "How was camp?"
[7:44] Yeah, you can say, "It was good. It was
[7:45] good." But the one thing that they're
[7:47] going to notice is your walk. If your
[7:51] walk is different,
[7:53] Jacob, listen, when he came into the
[7:56] presence of God and he was touched by
[7:58] and he wrestled with God, how did they
[8:00] know he was different?
[8:03] It was by his walk,
[8:06] the limping prophet. And that's how
[8:08] people are going to notice that your
[8:10] life was changed is your walk from this
[8:12] day forward. God bless you. We love you
[8:15] in the Lord. And safe travels
[8:18] [Applause]
[8:23] home. Praise the Lord. Yeah. Brother
[8:25] James is the the camp director, so I
[8:28] wanted to give him the opportunity to
[8:29] say a little something. Let's stand to
[8:31] our feet. We're going to sing thanks.
[8:32] Thanks. And if you want to come up, just
[8:34] come on up
[8:36] and set your set your offering in there.
[8:39] And we're just going to sing here and
[8:41] give thanks onto the Lord.
[8:44] Thanks. Is that the right
[8:49] song? I give you
[8:53] thanks for
[8:55] all
[8:56] you have done.
[8:59] [Music]
[9:02] I am so
[9:04] blessed. My soul has found
[9:07] rest. Oh
[9:10] Lord, I give you
[9:13] thanks. Let's give him praise this
[9:15] morning.
[9:17] Praise.
[9:19] Praise. I give you
[9:23] praise for
[9:25] all
[9:26] you have done.
[9:30] [Applause]
[9:32] I am so blessed.
[9:35] My soul has fallen.
[9:39] [Music]
[9:41] [Applause]
[9:43] [Music]
[9:45] [Applause]
[9:47] [Music]
[9:51] I give you
[9:53] thanks for all that you have
[10:00] done. And I am so
[10:04] blessed. My soul has found
[10:07] rest. Oh
[10:10] Lord, I give you thanks. One more time.
[10:14] Thanks. Thanks. Oh, thanks.
[10:19] Thanks, Lord. I give you
[10:23] thanks for
[10:25] all you have
[10:30] done. And I am so
[10:34] blessed. My soul has found
[10:37] rest. Oh
[10:40] Lord, I give you
[10:45] thanks. Amen. And it's good to be in the
[10:48] house of the Lord this morning. We do
[10:50] have a number of of song specials this
[10:53] morning. So, we'll try to get into those
[10:55] those shortly. If we could just sing See
[10:57] the Bright Light Shine. If our brother
[10:59] Zach Paige would come up, he's got a
[11:02] testimony and he's got a song and if you
[11:05] could open the service for us. Oh, see
[11:08] the bright light
[11:10] shine. It's just about home time.
[11:15] Oh, I can see my father
[11:19] standing at the
[11:22] door. This world's in a
[11:26] wilderness. I'm ready for
[11:30] deliverance. Oh, I've never been this
[11:34] home. Sing. Sing it
[11:37] again. I see the bright light shine.
[11:42] It's just about home
[11:45] time. And I can't see my father standing
[11:51] at the
[11:53] door. This world's in a
[11:57] wilderness. I'm ready for
[12:01] deliverance. And I've never been this
[12:05] home sick
[12:08] before. Brothers, I can bless you.
[12:13] Man, God bless you guys this morning. I
[12:15] How many believe that a Christian is
[12:17] supposed to testify and sometimes we're
[12:19] meant to be more than just a testimony
[12:21] to the world, but just a testimony to
[12:22] each other. So, I just wanted to uh
[12:25] share my experience last night that the
[12:27] Lord came by and just gave me a huge
[12:29] refilling of the Holy Spirit last night.
[12:31] And I'm just so thankful for that. And
[12:34] we were all up here kind of standing up
[12:35] here and you guys were all there
[12:37] obviously and uh singing in the choir
[12:40] and I saw Libby Saunders. She went to
[12:42] the back and uh was having brother Matt
[12:45] pray for her and I just really entered
[12:46] it and I really felt a burden on my
[12:48] heart just for Libby and then as soon as
[12:50] I just I saw Libby was getting touched
[12:52] and I just had a burden for her the
[12:54] spirit just fell on me right then and
[12:56] like I've never felt it before and just
[12:58] like almost collapsed on the ground and
[13:00] it was just such a special time for me
[13:02] and it's like you don't want to base it
[13:04] on emotions but for me I'm not a very
[13:06] emotional person in general so just
[13:08] feeling that emotion it was just kind of
[13:10] like a confirmation like the Lord like
[13:12] showing me like I'm here for you. And I
[13:14] just had a wonderful time with the Lord
[13:16] last night. And I had a song on my heart
[13:19] from the second service of camp that
[13:22] just I mean this is my sixth year at
[13:24] camp. And just over the years, it's like
[13:27] the children of Israel in the promised
[13:28] land. You don't get it all at once. And
[13:30] just looking back at all the things that
[13:31] the Lord has done through me at this
[13:33] camp and just it's been such a blessing
[13:36] in my life. So, uh I wanted to sing the
[13:38] little song. It is no secret.
[13:41] [Music]
[13:46] There's no
[13:50] secret what God can
[13:57] do. What he's done for
[14:04] others, he'll do for you.
[14:11] With arms wide
[14:17] open, he'll
[14:19] pardon
[14:23] you. It is no
[14:28] [Laughter]
[14:30] secret what God can do.
[14:39] There's no
[14:43] secret what God can
[14:49] do. What he's done for
[14:53] [Music]
[14:56] others, he'll do for
[15:02] you. His arms wide
[15:09] open. He'll
[15:11] part
[15:15] you. It is no
[15:21] secret what God can
[15:26] do. All right, let's all bow our heads
[15:29] together. Dear heavenly father, Lord,
[15:31] thank you God for this time that you've
[15:34] allowed us to have, Lord, and just all
[15:36] the efforts and all the people that have
[15:38] put in. Lord, as brother James said,
[15:40] it's all worth if one's soul is touched.
[15:42] And Lord, thank you, Father. I believe I
[15:44] was one of those souls that was touched
[15:46] this weekend. And Lord, we're just so
[15:49] grateful and thankful, Lord, and just
[15:51] have so much love in our hearts for you
[15:53] and just one another, Father. And Lord,
[15:56] I pray you just be with this service,
[15:58] Lord. there's one more person, Lord,
[16:00] that just needs a touch from you,
[16:01] Father, that they would be able to see,
[16:04] Lord, what he's done for others, he can
[16:06] do for them, Father. And Lord, that you
[16:08] would just come by them one more time
[16:10] and just give them a little nudge if
[16:13] that's what they need. And that you just
[16:15] be with the remainder of this service
[16:16] and with brother Steven and his message
[16:18] and just all the rest of the activities
[16:21] for the day that you just be a part of
[16:23] it. In your name we pray.
[16:25] Amen. Amen. Thank you. Bless
[16:32] you.
[16:34] Amen. If we could have um Sister Adeline
[16:38] and her group make her way up for their
[16:40] song special. Let's just sing that song.
[16:43] Ain't God good? He gives us so many
[16:46] blessings. Oh, ain't God
[16:49] good? He gives us so many blessings.
[16:53] Undeserving.
[16:55] That's what we
[16:57] are. We ought to thank
[17:00] him. Love and praise him a little more
[17:04] today and a whole lot more
[17:09] tomorrow.
[17:11] God gives us so many
[17:16] blessings. That's what we
[17:19] are. We are to thank him. Love and
[17:24] praise him a little more today and a
[17:28] whole lot more tomorrow. One more time.
[17:31] Ain't God
[17:32] good? To give us so many blessings
[17:38] underving. That's what we
[17:41] are. We got to thank
[17:43] him. Love and praise him a little more
[17:48] today and a whole lot more tomorrow.
[17:54] Oh, amen. Thank you for singing for us.
[17:57] Our brother Seth Marshall and his group,
[17:59] if you could come and sing right after
[18:01] would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
[18:05] I have a small testimony to give before
[18:07] we
[18:08] sing. So, I came to camp expecting more
[18:12] of God
[18:14] and he really blessed me last night.
[18:18] Um, I had been struggling with doubts in
[18:24] my mind
[18:28] and everything ever since I got to
[18:31] Arizona, starting with brother Steven
[18:33] Coffey's um, service Wednesday, it kind
[18:36] of just opened my eyes and like like the
[18:40] revelation really just struck me that
[18:43] I'm his and that I'm filled with his
[18:46] spirit and that Satan's just been lying
[18:48] to me, using my own um nature as the
[18:53] brothers had been preaching about. And I
[18:56] have been letting that nature
[18:58] override the nature deep inside
[19:02] me. And last night, I feel like God just
[19:05] gave me such a peace and such a
[19:10] revelation that I'm his and that his
[19:12] spirit dwells within me and I don't have
[19:15] to worry anymore. and that I just need
[19:18] to keep giving myself to him so he may
[19:21] keep filling me and keep drawing me
[19:23] closer to him. I play this song, blesses
[19:26] you.
[19:27] [Music]
[19:42] The Lord bless
[19:46] you and keep
[19:50] you, make his face shine upon you and be
[19:56] gracious to you. The Lord turn
[20:02] his face toward
[20:06] you and give you peace.
[20:14] The Lord bless
[20:18] you and keep
[20:22] you, make his face shine upon you and be
[20:28] gracious to you. The Lord turn
[20:34] his face towards
[20:38] you and
[20:40] give
[20:45] peace.
[20:51] Amen.
[20:55] Amen. Amen.
[21:01] [Music]
[21:08] Amen.
[21:11] Amen.
[21:17] Amen. The Lord bless
[21:21] you and keep you.
[21:26] Make his face shine upon you and be
[21:31] gracious to you. The Lord turn
[21:37] his face toward
[21:41] you and give you
[21:51] peace. Amen.

[22:12] [Applause]
[22:13] Amen. Amen.
[22:16] [Applause]
[22:19] May his favor be upon you and a thousand
[22:26] generations and your family and your
[22:30] children and their children and their
[22:33] children. May his favor be upon you and
[22:39] a thousand
[22:41] generations. Take your family and your
[22:45] children and their children and their
[22:49] children. May his presence go before you
[22:54] and behind you and beside you, all
[22:58] around you and within you. He is with
[23:03] you. He is with you in the morning, in
[23:08] the
[23:08] evening. And you're coming and you're
[23:12] going and you're weeping and
[23:16] rejoicing. He is for you. He is for you.
[23:21] He is for
[23:28] you.
[23:30] Amen. Heat.
[23:38] [Music]
[23:51] Oh, amen.
[23:59] [Applause]
[24:31] [Music]
[25:18] Hide
[25:20] me
[25:24] now
[25:26] under
[25:28] your wings.

[31:11] Who taught the
[31:13] sun where to stand
[31:16] in the
[31:19] morning? And who told the
[31:22] ocean you can only
[31:25] come this far?
[31:30] And
[31:31] who show the
[31:33] moon where to hide to
[31:37] leave those words alone can catch a
[31:42] falling
[31:45] star. And I
[31:48] know my
[31:51] redeemer lives.
[31:55] I
[31:56] know my
[31:59] redeemer.
[32:01] This let all
[32:04] creation
[32:06] testify. Let this life within me run. I
[32:12] know my
[32:14] redeemer
[32:17] lives. The very same God that spins
[32:23] things in orbit.
[32:27] are still the weary, the
[32:31] warning, the
[32:34] weak, and the same gentle
[32:38] hands that hold me when I'm
[32:42] broken. They conquer death to bring me
[32:47] victory.
[32:51] I
[32:52] know my
[32:55] redeemer
[32:58] lives. I
[33:00] know my
[33:03] redeemer
[33:05] lives. Let all
[33:08] creation
[33:10] testify. Let his life within me cry. And
[33:14] I
[33:15] know my
[33:18] redeemer. He
[33:20] lives to take away my
[33:24] shame. Oh, and he
[33:28] lives forever. I
[33:33] broke that the payment for
[33:37] myself was a precious life he gave. And
[33:42] now he's alive and left an empty grave.
[33:49] I know my
[33:53] redeemer. He
[33:56] lives. I know my
[34:01] redeemer
[34:03] lives. Let all
[34:05] creation
[34:08] testify. Let this life within me come.
[34:11] And I know my redeemer.

[34:23] lives. I know my
[34:27] redeemer he
[34:30] lives. Let all
[34:32] creation

[34:56] [Music]
[35:55] [Music]
[36:10] I've had many tears and sorrows. I've
[36:14] had questions for
[36:17] tomorrow. There's been times that I
[36:20] didn't know right from wrong.
[36:25] But in every
[36:28] situation, God gave blessing
[36:32] consolation that my
[36:34] trials only come to make me
[36:41] strong. Through it
[36:45] all, through it
[36:48] all, I've learned to trust in
[36:52] Jesus. I learn to trust in
[36:57] God. Through it
[37:01] all, through it
[37:04] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[37:10] word.
[37:14] And I've been a lot of
[37:17] places and I've seen a lot of
[37:21] faces, there's been times that I felt so
[37:26] all alone.
[37:30] But in my lonely
[37:33] hours, yes, those precious lonely
[37:37] hours, Jesus let me know that our worth
[37:42] is
[37:43] all. That's why I see through it
[37:49] all. Through it
[37:53] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[37:58] I learned to trust in
[38:02] God. Through it
[38:05] all, through it
[38:09] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[38:17] word. And I thank God for the
[38:21] mountains. And I thank him for the
[38:25] valleys.
[38:26] And I thank him for the storms he's
[38:30] brought me
[38:33] through. For if I never had a problem,
[38:39] how would I know that God could solve
[38:42] it? How would I know faith in this world
[38:47] could
[38:50] do it
[38:54] all?
[38:57] Heat. Heat.
[39:02] [Music]
[39:10] through it
[39:14] all to depend upon his
[39:22] word to depend upon his
[39:27] [Music]
[39:30] word. God bless you.
[39:33] [Applause]
[39:39] Amen. If we could all stand as we
[39:41] prepare to turn the service over to our
[39:43] brother
[39:43] Stephen. And if we could get Austin's
[39:46] mic on to help me with that song, Wings
[39:48] of
[39:50] Faith. Spread your wings on the wings of
[39:52] faith.
[39:55] Well, there are two
[39:58] roads that you may
[40:03] take. One by
[40:07] side and one
[40:12] by the word of
[40:15] God is what you
[40:19] see, what you believe.
[40:24] is what will be.
[40:29] had your
[40:31] wings to the wind of
[40:36] faith. You can
[40:40] fly to a
[40:42] [Applause]
[40:44] high
[40:48] do it's by
[40:52] grace. Send your
[40:56] wings to the winds of
[41:00] faith. Oh, what's your
[41:05] name? What's your
[41:09] cry? What's your
[41:11] [Music]
[41:11] [Applause]
[41:16] mountain? Just be the word of God.
[41:21] And by and
[41:24] by we will
[41:28] lose or you will
[41:32] fly. So set your
[41:36] wings to the wind of
[41:40] faith and you can
[41:44] fly to a higher place.
[41:49] Do not
[41:52] struggle for it's by
[41:57] grace. Set your
[42:00] wings to the winds of
[42:04] faith and watch the
[42:09] eagle in the
[42:12] sky. He does not struggle.
[42:16] [Applause]
[42:17] He does not
[42:21] strive for the
[42:24] power that makes him
[42:29] right. It's
[42:33] already inside.
[42:37] So set your
[42:39] [Applause]
[42:41] wings with the
[42:44] faith. Oh, you can
[42:48] fly to a higher
[42:53] place. Do not
[42:56] struggle for it is by grace.
[43:02] Send your
[43:04] wings to the winds of
[43:08] [Music]
[43:09] faith. Amen. Praise the
[43:14] Lord. You happy to be in the house of
[43:16] the Lord this morning? The house of the
[43:18] Lord is wherever the people of the Lord
[43:21] gather. And uh we just all happen to
[43:24] find ourselves in this building this
[43:27] morning. And you know, it's a beautiful
[43:30] thing.
[43:33] Um God honors his word and we've
[43:36] gathered all of us together. We've
[43:38] gathered in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:40] Christ and the Lord is very clear when
[43:43] you do that where there are two or more
[43:46] gathered. I will be with you. So that
[43:49] means that the Lord is here
[43:53] um because he honors his word. So he's
[43:56] here this morning. So you personally,
[43:59] you might not feel goosebumps and feel
[44:02] that at this moment, but he's here
[44:05] because he honors his word. That means
[44:07] that he's able to pass by your seat and
[44:10] speak directly to you. What you have
[44:13] need of, the questions that you
[44:16] have, the difficulties that you have,
[44:19] he'll speak directly to you. But this
[44:22] morning, this being our last
[44:25] service, I I want to ask you to do
[44:27] something. I want to ask you to really
[44:29] press in. Uh I liked what brother Steven
[44:32] said. We'll sleep tonight. We'll sleep
[44:37] later, but right now, let's really press
[44:40] in to what the Holy Spirit has for us
[44:44] because we believe he's here. And being
[44:46] that he's here, he can speak to us. So I
[44:50] know that all of us, adults and all of
[44:54] us, we need him. I I need answers. I
[44:58] need encouragement. I need
[45:01] guidance. So that being the case, let's
[45:04] press in. And you do that simply by
[45:06] saying, "Lord, speak to me what you
[45:08] would have me to know." You might say,
[45:11] "Lord, I need this. I need this. I need
[45:12] this." But let the Lord speak to you
[45:14] what he knows you need. And that may be
[45:17] different than what you're thinking. So
[45:19] now that your heart is open, we've
[45:21] worshiped, let the Lord deal with with
[45:24] whatever he chooses. Is that okay? Amen.
[45:27] Press into that. Let's do that. Let's
[45:31] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are so
[45:33] thankful this
[45:35] morning that you are in our midst. We
[45:39] believe your word. You honor your word.
[45:42] And so Lord, we submit ourselves into
[45:45] the presence of the Lord this
[45:47] morning so that you can do what you see
[45:51] fit. May you have genuinely truly may
[45:55] you have the
[45:57] preeminence. Lord, we are a people with
[45:59] hungry
[46:01] hearts. So I ask that you would flow
[46:04] just flow through us, Holy Spirit. and
[46:08] may you deal with our hearts and our
[46:12] minds. We love you. We give this service
[46:15] into your hands and in the name of the
[46:17] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[46:20] Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. Thank
[46:23] you. Musicians sounded so wonderful this
[46:27] morning. All the
[46:29] singing. I'd like to invite you to turn
[46:31] with me uh just while you're standing in
[46:34] uh to the book of Philippians, chapter
[46:36] 3. And I want to read a passage there.
[46:39] Philippians the 3rd chapter. Just before
[46:41] we read, um it's so good to be here and
[46:43] I just want to say a a thank you again
[46:47] uh to brother Ron and to Evening Light
[46:49] Fellowship for
[46:51] um putting on this camp. Um and it's
[46:55] been an honor to be here with all of you
[46:58] and uh serving alongside brother Matt
[47:00] and uh just getting into what the Lord
[47:03] would have for us today. It's a
[47:05] beautiful
[47:06] thing. So, I I'm I'm just honored to be
[47:10] able to do that. And I I look at this uh
[47:12] I look at camps like this as um you
[47:14] know, something that is more than um
[47:18] just something that we decided to do. I
[47:20] I think they're I think they're God
[47:22] ordained. I really do. Um he said,
[47:25] "Forsake not the assembling of
[47:27] yourselves together." And we are not. We
[47:30] go to our churches. We we we go to
[47:32] churches. we we press our shoulder to
[47:34] the um to the wheel, but we've we've
[47:37] purposefully set aside time to gather
[47:39] together in this way, and the Lord
[47:41] honors that. I I think it's a wonderful
[47:43] thing. So, this is a I think this is
[47:45] fantastic. So, um it's been a pleasure
[47:48] to be here with all of you, and uh I
[47:50] haven't gotten to meet every single one
[47:51] of you, but I hope I do. Uh um at least
[47:54] make new friends before we go. Uh and
[47:58] things like that. Praise the Lord.
[48:01] Let's read Philippians chapter
[48:05] 3
[48:07] chapter and let's let's start in the eth
[48:11] verse.
[48:13] Now I uh this is a this is a very this
[48:18] is one of my favorite books. I say that
[48:20] about all the books. This is one of my
[48:22] favorites. I come back to this a lot and
[48:26] um just personally and I I just I just
[48:30] enjoy Paul's approach because he writes
[48:32] this um while he's under arrest. He's in
[48:36] jail when he writes this. So he's
[48:39] speaking on a very personal level and
[48:41] this is a man that has had I mean this
[48:44] is a a prophet a a major prophet. I mean
[48:47] he is the messenger of the day and he
[48:50] has had experience. Uh he's been around
[48:52] he's been around the uh the block a few
[48:55] times. I mean he he was you know beaten
[48:57] up all the all the different things that
[48:59] had happened to Paul. Pretty amazing
[49:01] story, life story. And then he finds
[49:04] himself under arrest and he writes
[49:06] Philippians. And so you hear a person in
[49:10] a difficult circumstance speaking from
[49:14] maturity and that's an amazing thing.
[49:17] Now he says this Philippians 3 chapter
[49:20] and let's start in verse 8 or verse 7.
[49:24] But what things were gain to me those I
[49:28] counted a loss for Christ. Yay doubtless
[49:32] I count all things but a loss for the
[49:34] excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[49:36] Jesus my Lord. for whom I have suffered
[49:39] the loss of all things and do count them
[49:43] but dung that I may win
[49:48] Christ and I and be found in him not
[49:50] having mine own righteousness which is
[49:54] of the law but that which is through the
[49:56] faith of Christ the righteousness which
[49:59] is of God by
[50:02] faith that I may know him and the power
[50:06] of his resurrection
[50:08] and the fellowship of his
[50:11] sufferings, being made conformable unto
[50:13] his death, if by any means I might
[50:16] attain unto the resurrection of of the
[50:19] dead, not as though I had already
[50:21] attained, either were already perfect,
[50:25] but I follow after, if that I may
[50:29] apprehend that for which I also I am
[50:31] apprehended of Christ.
[50:34] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[50:37] apprehended, but this one thing I do.
[50:41] Now remember, he says this as a person
[50:43] filled with the Holy Spirit. He says,
[50:45] "Brethren, I count myself not to have
[50:48] appre apprehended, but this one thing I
[50:51] do, forgetting those things which are
[50:54] behind and reaching forth unto those
[50:58] things which are before." Amen. I press
[51:02] towards the mark for the prize of the
[51:06] high calling of God in Christ
[51:09] Jesus. May the Lord bless the reading of
[51:12] his word. You can be seated.
[51:16] I uh I was just talking to brother Matt
[51:19] there before the uh service and if you
[51:21] notice I don't know if uh maybe you've
[51:24] pulled just you know certain things um
[51:27] that you were really dealing with but if
[51:28] you notice the theme uh from Thursday
[51:31] night, Friday night, Saturday
[51:38] morning day if you notice the theme uh
[51:42] dig the ditch
[51:45] Dig the ditch. Understand who is the one
[51:48] that is going to fill
[51:50] it and understand that it's Christ in
[51:53] you, the hope of glory. And now step
[51:56] into that relationship. Step into that
[51:59] life. If you notice the theme, I think
[52:02] the Holy Spirit is really searching for
[52:05] someone.
[52:07] I think he has really been searching for
[52:09] somebody. And I hope it's you. Amen. I
[52:13] hope it's you and I hope that you have
[52:14] been found of him. In Matthew chapter
[52:17] 24,
[52:20] uh I believe it's 24. He's
[52:23] um there's a lot of people that are
[52:24] standing beneath the throne and they
[52:26] say, you know, Lord, we we knew you. Did
[52:28] not we cast out devils in your name? And
[52:30] all of these different things. And um
[52:34] they knew him very well. The people
[52:38] standing in front of Jesus knew him. And
[52:40] Jesus turned around and he said this,
[52:41] 'Depart from me because I never knew
[52:44] you.
[52:46] So they knew him. They knew all about
[52:48] him and they were casting out devils and
[52:51] yet Jesus never knew them. I think this
[52:55] week end this camp, the Lord has been
[52:58] searching for someone and I pray that
[53:01] he's found that person
[53:04] and that you are found of him. Paul
[53:06] would say that rather you have been
[53:08] found of him that you are known by him.
[53:11] That's what you want is to be known by
[53:13] him for him to call you by name. And
[53:15] that's the message of the hour. Voice
[53:17] calling out of heaven to you calling
[53:20] your name to come into Christ. It's a
[53:24] beautiful thing. But you know, we still
[53:26] got a few minutes
[53:28] left. So if you are still dealing with
[53:31] something, you're still struggling with
[53:32] something, there is still time.
[53:35] So, don't let this moment go by. Press
[53:38] into what the Lord would have for us
[53:41] today. I'm going to be myself. I'm going
[53:43] to be what the Lord has put put me to
[53:45] put on my heart to say, um, I'm going to
[53:48] do that, but I need you to do the same.
[53:50] I need you to be yourselves. I need you
[53:52] to be present where you're at and let
[53:54] the Lord deal with you. And I I know
[53:56] that the Lord was working last night.
[53:58] How many of you enjoyed that service
[53:59] last night? Uh, just incredible.
[54:04] and just just dealing so I think
[54:08] precisely and uh I know that there were
[54:11] there were um individuals who received a
[54:14] touch last night from Almighty God.
[54:16] That's a beautiful thing. I love just
[54:19] worshiping. Uh I just love worshiping.
[54:23] Um that's that's what you want to press
[54:26] into is what would the Lord have for me
[54:28] in this moment. Now, uh I I I want to um
[54:36] we've got a little bit of time. Uh I I I
[54:38] the morning sessions, we've got a little
[54:40] bit longer of a period of time. Uh so we
[54:43] can we can flesh things out. How many of
[54:45] you would like to flesh out a few
[54:47] things? Um you know, a lot of people
[54:50] call it teaching. Brother Brandham
[54:51] called it placing. And I think in the
[54:54] you know, in a morning service like this
[54:55] on a Sunday morning, we can maybe take
[54:57] our time a little bit and flesh things
[54:59] out. And I think the Lord can really use
[55:01] that uh because teaching places you um
[55:05] you need to be grabbed by the lapels
[55:07] sometimes. You need to be grabbed by the
[55:10] lapels and you need to be said you can
[55:13] make it. You you find the Lord. But then
[55:16] sometimes you need to you need to work
[55:19] through things. You need to work through
[55:22] the scripture. You need to work through
[55:23] how brother Brandham laid things out.
[55:25] And that can that can really pos that
[55:27] can anchor you firmly. That's a really
[55:30] important thing. We need to be anchored
[55:32] in the word of God, not in our opinions
[55:35] of it. We need to be anchored in the
[55:37] word of God, not just in our opinions of
[55:40] it.
[55:42] I think that should deserve a better
[55:43] amen because we all can have opinions of
[55:46] it. Every single denomination on earth,
[55:48] every single religion has an opinion of
[55:50] of, you know, every denomination has an
[55:52] opinion of the scripture. I don't want
[55:54] to live by an opinion of it. I want to
[55:56] live by it.
[55:59] Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[56:01] by every word that proceeds out of the
[56:02] mouth of God. So I want to align my
[56:05] thinking to that to the word of God.
[56:08] That's where we want to be. Now I want
[56:10] to talk about I want to talk about two
[56:12] things. Um and we'll if is if if you
[56:15] pull um I'll go I'll go where the Lord
[56:18] leads. Um but I I want to talk about two
[56:22] things. And that's that's one. How how
[56:24] do you how can you know that you have
[56:26] the Holy
[56:27] Ghost? Uh it's been talked about all
[56:30] week if you've been listening. It's been
[56:32] talked about all week. But I think it's
[56:35] important and this is the one thing that
[56:37] I hear all over the world when I travel
[56:39] and I preach and I talk to people and I
[56:41] ask the one thing um and I and I I this
[56:45] was on my heart as soon as brother Ron
[56:47] asked me to speak. this dropped on my
[56:50] heart and uh I I wanted to talk about
[56:53] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and how
[56:56] to know you have it. I I was um was
[56:59] counseling and even brother Matt
[57:00] mentioned a c a story last night about
[57:02] someone wondering, you know, whether
[57:04] they they had it. And I can't tell you
[57:07] the amount of older middle-aged people,
[57:09] but then uh even older towards their
[57:12] senior years and especially young people
[57:14] who struggle with that question. Do I
[57:16] have it? and and how do I know that I
[57:19] have it? And you know, I think um we
[57:25] need to know, you need to make your
[57:28] election and calling sure. You need to
[57:31] be able to drive a stake in the ground
[57:33] and say, "Satan, it was this is no
[57:37] longer a question that you can plague me
[57:39] with. I know."
[57:42] So, I want you to be able to know. And I
[57:46] if if I'm my question my my goal this
[57:48] morning is not to cause you to wonder if
[57:50] you have it. If you have it, you need to
[57:53] know. But if you're wondering and you
[57:55] don't know and you're you're or you
[57:58] don't have it, then I want you to have
[58:00] it. And you can have it this morning.
[58:04] You can have the baptism of the Holy
[58:06] Spirit as I'm speaking to you. As the
[58:09] word goes forth, you can receive the
[58:11] baptism of the Holy Spirit. I want you
[58:13] to know what it is and how to have it.
[58:15] But then the second thing that I want to
[58:17] talk about is how do we live with it
[58:21] because I don't know about you, but I I
[58:24] have I have work to do on Monday. I have
[58:27] work to do on Monday. I got to go back.
[58:28] I uh I'm a pastor, but the Lord is um
[58:31] the Lord led me to work with a a small
[58:33] group of um consultants doing a very
[58:36] specific thing. And uh I just um I feel
[58:39] a a calling there. And um I I my my
[58:44] church um I I serve my church with all
[58:49] that I am. And
[58:51] uh I got to go. I got to I got I have a
[58:54] few meetings on Monday. I don't know if
[58:56] you have to go back to work on Monday,
[58:58] but this is wonderful what we have, but
[59:03] we got to go and we got to we got to
[59:06] make a living. You got to provide for
[59:08] yourself. You got to provide for your
[59:09] family. You might be in school, you got
[59:11] to go back to school. And brother Bannon
[59:13] would make the phrase, it's the in the
[59:15] harsh realities of everyday living,
[59:17] that's where the Christian life is lived
[59:19] out. So I don't want to just have an
[59:22] experience here. I want to live my
[59:25] sermon. I want to I want to take my
[59:27] experience and I want to go and I want
[59:29] to live a fruitful life.
[59:32] I want to really pursue the leading of
[59:34] the Holy Spirit. I don't want to just
[59:36] have the Holy Spirit. I want to pursue
[59:38] him. I want to say, "Lord, where would
[59:39] you have me go?" I want to listen for
[59:41] the the the the the wind in the mberry
[59:44] bushes. I want to say, "Lord, where
[59:45] would you have me?" I want to pick my
[59:47] foot up and I want to say, "Lord, tell
[59:48] me where to put it down." Amen. The
[59:50] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[59:52] by the Lord. But sometimes you got to
[59:53] pick your foot up and say, "Lord, where
[59:55] do I where do I put it?" And move
[59:57] forward. Lord is not about having you
[1:00:00] stay right where you're at. He never
[1:00:01] was. Sometimes you have to wait. They
[1:00:04] that wait on the Lord shall renew their
[1:00:06] strength. But the intention is never to
[1:00:09] stay where you're at. He was always
[1:00:11] calling out of and into. So you've got
[1:00:14] to move forward. The goal, the objective
[1:00:16] is to move towards a body change and to
[1:00:19] live a fruitful life along the way. And
[1:00:21] I don't know about you, but I would kind
[1:00:23] of like to enjoy it along the way. Life
[1:00:25] is tough enough as it is. I would like
[1:00:27] to enjoy the Holy Spirit in my life. I
[1:00:30] want to go I want to go climb mountains.
[1:00:32] I want to go I want to, you know, be uh
[1:00:34] uh hang out with my wife. I want to um
[1:00:37] have church dinners and uh you know have
[1:00:40] as many church dinners as we can. I live
[1:00:43] in the south so we have church dinners
[1:00:44] and they're are very serious occasions.
[1:00:46] Um and I I want to I want to have church
[1:00:48] dinners. I want to hang out with you
[1:00:50] guys. I want to live life to the
[1:00:52] fullest.
[1:00:53] I really want to pursue uh being who God
[1:00:57] wants me to be. That's right.
[1:01:01] I want to live a I want to live a full
[1:01:02] life while I am still here. I don't want
[1:01:07] to just live plagued by Satan day in and
[1:01:09] day out. He He will do that and that
[1:01:12] happens, but I'm not going to let that
[1:01:15] define where I am. So the I want you to
[1:01:18] focus in now on Philippians chapter 3.
[1:01:20] All throughout this service, forgetting
[1:01:23] those things which are behind and
[1:01:26] pressing towards the mark.
[1:01:28] Now, let's talk about it. I think um the
[1:01:31] worst
[1:01:32] thing that we could do, and brother
[1:01:35] Matt, I think you may have said this um
[1:01:37] brother, I think you may have said this
[1:01:38] in in the devotional to some degree. Uh
[1:01:41] you mentioned it briefly. I think the
[1:01:43] worst thing that we can do is complicate
[1:01:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Sometimes
[1:01:47] I feel as a minister, I complicate it. I
[1:01:50] have a very simple I I have a very
[1:01:52] simple mind. I am not very smart. And so
[1:01:54] I have to break things down and
[1:01:55] understand them. It's just my nature.
[1:01:56] That's the way I am. I have to break
[1:01:58] things down and just lay it all out and
[1:02:00] and watch it and look at it and say and
[1:02:02] then break it down then I can understand
[1:02:04] it. So that's the way I have to work. I
[1:02:06] think the worst thing that we can do is
[1:02:08] is is complicate it because it is not
[1:02:10] complicated. So let's talk about it and
[1:02:12] let's look through the scriptures. Let's
[1:02:14] look at how brother Brandham talked
[1:02:16] about it um in the word. Now in 1963 the
[1:02:20] token which we know uh the token is the
[1:02:23] Holy Spirit and in that message he says
[1:02:25] the message of the hour is a sign to the
[1:02:28] churches. It's a sign to the people.
[1:02:31] Don't are you catching it? I hope on the
[1:02:35] tape which is that's us because we
[1:02:37] weren't there. I hope on the tape that
[1:02:39] they are doing the same thing. In other
[1:02:41] parts of the world, the hour sign is
[1:02:43] here. There is a token and it's got to
[1:02:46] be applied and no other time could it
[1:02:49] could have come. Now you what you cannot
[1:02:53] have is a bucket full of blood and a dry
[1:02:56] brush.
[1:02:59] Tken is the Holy Spirit. But the token
[1:03:03] in Exodus
[1:03:05] chapter 12 and then in uh
[1:03:08] Ephesians, the blood shall be for you a
[1:03:11] token upon the houses ye are. And when I
[1:03:13] see the blood, I'll pass over you and
[1:03:15] the plague shall not be upon you to
[1:03:18] destroy you.
[1:03:21] So the the token is a seal. So you
[1:03:26] cannot have an
[1:03:27] unapplied token. The token is the Holy
[1:03:30] Ghost. And you cannot have an unapplied
[1:03:34] token. You cannot have a bucket of blood
[1:03:37] and a dry brush. You have to take the
[1:03:39] bucket, dip the brush into the blood,
[1:03:41] and spread it over the mantle. You have
[1:03:44] to apply the token. So it isn't enough
[1:03:47] just to understand what the token is. Uh
[1:03:50] you have to have it and it has to be
[1:03:53] applied.
[1:03:56] You grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[1:03:58] you are sealed until the day of your
[1:04:01] redemption. Now what we are seeking a a
[1:04:06] a personal relationship with the Lord
[1:04:08] not just knowledge but in experience.
[1:04:12] So I don't want to just have the
[1:04:14] knowledge of what these things are. I
[1:04:16] want to have the experience of the Holy
[1:04:19] Ghost and know the person of the Lord
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ. Now what what is the
[1:04:23] message? Christ
[1:04:26] Christ in you the hope of glory.
[1:04:30] And it is a voice out of heaven calling
[1:04:32] to
[1:04:33] you come up hither. And to do that you
[1:04:37] have to be in Christ in a new birth in a
[1:04:43] baptism of the Holy Spirit. It is the
[1:04:47] oil. It is necessary. It is paramount
[1:04:50] that you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:54] Ghost, an applied token. Without
[1:04:58] it, you will be looking for oil while
[1:05:02] the bride goes away with the bridegroom.
[1:05:05] Remember now, oil represents the Holy
[1:05:08] Spirit. The wise virgins were looking
[1:05:10] for oil. They understood what it was and
[1:05:13] they they were looking. They wanted it.
[1:05:17] Yes. So, the foolish virgins did want
[1:05:19] the oil, but they did not have it in
[1:05:22] their
[1:05:23] lamps. The wise virgins did, and they
[1:05:26] were the ones that were taken by the
[1:05:28] bridegroom. So, you cannot have a bucket
[1:05:31] of blood and a dry brush. You cannot
[1:05:33] have an unapplied token. You have to
[1:05:36] have a relationship with the Lord. You
[1:05:38] pursue that in experience, not just in
[1:05:41] knowledge. Yes. Now to understand that
[1:05:46] um brother Bham said uh this the word of
[1:05:50] God the Holy Ghost is the new birth. We
[1:05:54] know that it's being born again of the
[1:05:57] spirit of God. That's how you're born by
[1:06:01] the spirit. Born by the spirit. That's
[1:06:03] the new birth. You're begotten of the
[1:06:07] spirit. And then when you're born of the
[1:06:09] spirit, you're filled with the Holy
[1:06:11] Ghost. So I'm going to let brother
[1:06:13] Brandham and the scripture have the say.
[1:06:17] Okay? I don't want to I don't want to
[1:06:18] over complicate it with my ramblings. I
[1:06:22] want to let the word be the word. Okay?
[1:06:25] So you should do the same. So let's look
[1:06:27] at look at what he's saying. Now, I I
[1:06:29] want to um uh I also I I want to look at
[1:06:33] uh this story because it's one of the
[1:06:37] most important conversations that I
[1:06:38] think was had up until the point where
[1:06:41] Nicodemus is standing in front of Jesus.
[1:06:42] Now, I'll paraphrase this a little bit
[1:06:44] just for the sake of time, but Nicodemus
[1:06:46] was a man who was um a really good
[1:06:50] really good man and he wanted to know I
[1:06:54] think all of us want to know. I want to
[1:06:56] know what is the Holy Ghost? What is the
[1:06:58] baptism of the Holy Spirit and how do I
[1:06:59] know that I have it? Right? It's one of
[1:07:02] the primary questions that people face
[1:07:04] or have. So when I when you think about
[1:07:08] how Nicodemus was coming, he was coming
[1:07:10] with an inquisitive nature. But you also
[1:07:12] have to understand that that Nicodemus
[1:07:14] um was a major religious leader. Like he
[1:07:18] he understood scriptural principles. He
[1:07:21] understood the Torah. He had a lot of
[1:07:23] head knowledge about what things were.
[1:07:25] But understand his perception was uh of
[1:07:29] the law and what he did in in in the
[1:07:33] face of the law, right? He was a he was
[1:07:36] a Pharisee. He was a very intelligent
[1:07:39] individual and his perception of
[1:07:42] religion and what it meant to be in in
[1:07:45] uh uh uh to worship Jehovah was only on
[1:07:48] the basis of what he did. Right. Right.
[1:07:52] I don't think he was a legalist. I think
[1:07:54] the what was happening in that day is
[1:07:57] that religion became legalistic and
[1:08:00] hypocritical because legalism breeds
[1:08:02] hypocrisy right you know um you can
[1:08:05] listen to this song but you can't listen
[1:08:07] to this song when that song is frankly
[1:08:09] just the same as this song but uh we
[1:08:12] don't listen to that one we only it's
[1:08:13] it's a little bit hypocritical in nature
[1:08:16] right uh legalistic breeds legalism
[1:08:20] breeds that but remember what I said the
[1:08:22] other day brother brother Vanam said
[1:08:23] that legalism makes really good
[1:08:25] Christians.
[1:08:27] Uh so um when Nicodemus comes, I don't
[1:08:32] think he was a legalist. I think he
[1:08:33] really wanted to know. And he's sitting
[1:08:34] there in front of Jesus and he says,
[1:08:36] "How how um how can a man enter into the
[1:08:39] kingdom of God is essentially his
[1:08:41] question. And Jesus says, "Verily,
[1:08:43] verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
[1:08:45] born of water and of spirit." Now this
[1:08:49] was totally different. It was
[1:08:51] revolutionary.
[1:08:52] Jesus totally flipped the script on
[1:08:55] Nicodemus because nobody talked about
[1:08:58] the kingdom of God in terms of birth and
[1:09:01] in terms of that type of regeneration.
[1:09:04] Right? So Nicodemus it was it was
[1:09:06] foreign to him to the point where and he
[1:09:09] had no understanding of this to the
[1:09:11] point where he said how how is a do I
[1:09:15] enter into my mother's womb a second
[1:09:16] time? I almost feel if that was almost a
[1:09:18] jovial question like he was being a
[1:09:20] little bit sarcastic. He was saying,
[1:09:22] "How is that going to work?" He didn't
[1:09:24] know. He had no idea. It was totally
[1:09:27] revolutionary for Nicodemus. He did not
[1:09:29] know what it meant to be born again.
[1:09:32] Now, you know the lingo because most of
[1:09:34] you have been raised in the message. We
[1:09:36] know we know the terminology. You got to
[1:09:38] be filled with the Holy Ghost. You got
[1:09:39] to be reborn. You got to be You've heard
[1:09:41] these statements, these phrases all your
[1:09:44] life.
[1:09:46] Nicodemus, this was a totally new
[1:09:47] concept for him. So when he's there, he
[1:09:49] understood, you know, the concept of God
[1:09:51] will give you a new heart. Ezekiel talks
[1:09:53] about, you know, create uh uh giving a
[1:09:56] new heart. David created me a clean
[1:09:58] heart. The application of the blood as a
[1:10:01] means to redemption was through the
[1:10:03] temple, but never you must be born
[1:10:06] again.
[1:10:08] Totally revolutionary thinking. And he
[1:10:10] says, "Unless a man is born of water and
[1:10:15] of spirit, he cannot be born again.
[1:10:18] He cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[1:10:20] You cannot have a bucket of blood and an
[1:10:23] unapplied token. Jesus is is is saying
[1:10:26] the ex this is Jesus's gospel. You've
[1:10:28] got to have the token applied. Be born
[1:10:32] of water and of spirit.
[1:10:35] And then he says this. He says the it's
[1:10:37] like the wind. And the wind is an
[1:10:41] amazing thing. Uh you know you've all
[1:10:44] experienced wind I I assume. Uh, and
[1:10:47] wind. It just comes and goes as it
[1:10:50] pleases. It just comes and it just it's
[1:10:53] just it just comes and you're you're
[1:10:55] just out of nowhere. You're it's oh man,
[1:10:57] it's really windy, but you can't you see
[1:10:59] the effects of it. You don't actually
[1:11:01] see wind, right? You see the effects of
[1:11:03] it. And there's, you know, magnetical uh
[1:11:05] uh magnetic magnetic uh forces all
[1:11:08] around um whatever whatever wind is. And
[1:11:12] it's it's exactly like the Holy Spirit
[1:11:16] because we don't control
[1:11:19] God. The Holy Spirit is like the wind.
[1:11:21] He comes where he wants to go.
[1:11:26] He is the almighty God. He comes and
[1:11:28] goes. So that's that's what the Holy
[1:11:30] Spirit is to be born again. It's like
[1:11:32] the wind. He comes when he wants to
[1:11:36] come. He comes. He he he blows. He is he
[1:11:40] he it's it's like it just comes and it
[1:11:41] goes.
[1:11:43] So that's what Jesus is preaching now to
[1:11:46] Nicodemus really messing with his
[1:11:48] theology if you will. Now in the se uh
[1:11:51] church age book um brother Brandham in
[1:11:55] in this in the phrasing he says this and
[1:11:57] I just want to uh lay this here. What is
[1:12:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost? It is the
[1:12:02] spirit baptizing you into the body of
[1:12:04] Christ. It is the new birth. It is the
[1:12:07] spirit of God coming in and filling you
[1:12:09] after you have repented, having heard
[1:12:12] his word and been baptized in water as
[1:12:15] an answer of good conscience towards
[1:12:18] God. I love that phraseology. It's
[1:12:20] exactly what he's saying here in 1960.
[1:12:22] The word of God, the Holy Ghost is the
[1:12:24] new birth. We know that it's been it's
[1:12:28] being born again of the spirit of God.
[1:12:33] the the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:12:35] new birth. He says we know that now in
[1:12:39] to carry on then with with that to
[1:12:42] understand what the Holy Ghost is. We
[1:12:45] know who the Holy Ghost is, right? We
[1:12:47] learned that yesterday. It is that
[1:12:49] cosmic light that started out in the
[1:12:51] very beginning. God himself,
[1:12:55] right? All that God was, he poured into
[1:12:57] the being Christ and then Christ was
[1:13:00] poured into you.
[1:13:03] So we know that Christ 2 Corinthians
[1:13:05] chapter 3. Now the Lord is that spirit
[1:13:09] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:13:10] there is liberty. John chapter 14. And I
[1:13:12] pray the father and he shall give you a
[1:13:14] comforter that may that he may abide
[1:13:17] with you forever even the spirit of
[1:13:19] truth. The Holy Ghost, the baptism of
[1:13:21] the Holy Ghost, it is a seal. It is a
[1:13:25] token. He is the comforter. He is the
[1:13:28] prince of peace. You use different
[1:13:30] terms. We use different uh brother
[1:13:32] Brandham preaches different sermons. We
[1:13:34] use all these different things. We see
[1:13:36] different scriptures. He is the seal. He
[1:13:39] is the token. It is the person of the
[1:13:43] Lord Jesus Christ in you in a new birth,
[1:13:47] a baptism
[1:13:50] of the Holy Spirit. That's what it is.
[1:13:54] That's who it is. Now, if you look now,
[1:13:58] I I want you just for a second. I want
[1:14:00] you I want to make sure that we
[1:14:02] understand this. I want you to I want
[1:14:04] you to really understand what it is not.
[1:14:06] Okay? Because I I feel like when and I'm
[1:14:09] I'm speaking this not for any other
[1:14:12] reason and I I mean this sincerely. I'm
[1:14:15] not preaching at anybody. Uh I am saying
[1:14:18] this from my personal story, my
[1:14:20] testimony. Because when I was sitting in
[1:14:22] your seat and I was thinking even this
[1:14:24] morning um it was like uh early this
[1:14:27] morning. I was just laying there and I
[1:14:29] was thinking I I was trying to remember
[1:14:31] what was I thinking when I was 16 in
[1:14:33] your seat and I can't remember uh but I
[1:14:36] I got pretty close and I I remember um
[1:14:40] sitting there and uh I remember one
[1:14:43] specific time I think brother Diggs was
[1:14:45] speaking um I remember another time
[1:14:48] there was brother Burley speaking uh and
[1:14:50] I remember sitting there in your seat
[1:14:52] your age and I was thinking come on tell
[1:14:56] me come on. And I remember just pulling
[1:14:59] just and and I wasn't really where I
[1:15:01] should have been with the Lord, but uh
[1:15:03] personally, but I was just I I want I
[1:15:06] tell me, tell me, tell me. And I was
[1:15:08] thinking, okay, I'm I'm going to I'm
[1:15:10] going to respond. I'm going to respond.
[1:15:12] I'm going to push through what people
[1:15:13] think of me around me. And uh I'm going
[1:15:16] to push through that. I'm going to
[1:15:17] respond. I'm going to make that that
[1:15:18] effort to go to the altar. And the
[1:15:20] service wasn't even done yet. The
[1:15:21] preacher wasn't even really started. But
[1:15:23] in my mind, I was thinking, I'm I'm
[1:15:25] going to go and I'm going to make the
[1:15:26] effort
[1:15:30] um because I know that I need the Lord.
[1:15:32] I know that I need to respond to him. I
[1:15:34] know that he needs to deal in my life,
[1:15:36] but I I've got
[1:15:40] these I remember thinking, I'm going to
[1:15:42] I'm going to I'm going to do it. So, I
[1:15:44] had already in my mind worked up that I
[1:15:46] am going to go to the altar. I'm going
[1:15:48] to feel something and then I will then I
[1:15:51] will have what I want to
[1:15:54] feel I needed. Right?
[1:15:59] That was that was young Steve's brain. I
[1:16:02] wasn't really listening to the word and
[1:16:04] I wasn't responding to the prompting of
[1:16:08] the spirit. I was working up this
[1:16:11] formula and this set of actions that I
[1:16:14] was going to check off. I did this. I
[1:16:16] came to the altar. Check. I kneel down.
[1:16:18] Check. I felt something. Check. Minister
[1:16:20] laid his hands on me. Check. And then I
[1:16:22] get up and then I'll be fine. So, I had
[1:16:25] worked out this formula in my brain and
[1:16:27] I wasn't listening to the word. I wasn't
[1:16:29] responding to the Holy Spirit. I wasn't
[1:16:31] really interacting with the person of
[1:16:32] the Lord Jesus Christ that was in the
[1:16:35] room. In my brain, I was working out the
[1:16:37] formula. So, I want to I want to share
[1:16:39] with you what it is not. And I fear too
[1:16:40] often that sometimes as as just people,
[1:16:43] right, as as us in this room, we
[1:16:46] overemphasize the emotion that the Holy
[1:16:49] Spirit brings to the point that we
[1:16:51] reduce the Holy Spirit himself to a
[1:16:55] feeling.
[1:16:57] When the Holy Spirit himself is not a
[1:17:00] feeling,
[1:17:01] the Holy Spirit himself is not an
[1:17:04] emotion. He is the alpha and the omega.
[1:17:08] He is the all powerful. He is the life
[1:17:12] itself.
[1:17:14] He is the the um the He is my he is
[1:17:21] everything to me. He is he is power. He
[1:17:24] is might. He is strength. He is the
[1:17:28] person of the Lord Jesus Christ. But he
[1:17:30] himself is not a feeling. He is not an
[1:17:34] emotion.
[1:17:35] So if in my brain I was checking off the
[1:17:38] boxes to make sure that I got the
[1:17:41] feeling and the emotion and equating
[1:17:43] that to then having him
[1:17:47] and I would walk away, go back Monday
[1:17:49] and live the exact same life that I was
[1:17:51] when I came into camp. And I would live
[1:17:53] camp to camp to camp to camp to camp.
[1:17:55] And I wouldn't know, okay, how do I live
[1:17:57] my life? How do I know that I've met the
[1:18:00] Lord? And I didn't understand what it
[1:18:03] was. So, I want you to understand that
[1:18:04] it's not and I'm going I I I I think
[1:18:07] it's too often the case that that
[1:18:08] happens. Now, understand that when you
[1:18:11] meet the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:14] and you are in his presence at an altar
[1:18:16] at your seat and a tree out in the
[1:18:19] woods, there is emotion, right? You may
[1:18:23] not be an emotional person,
[1:18:26] but there is emotion. You are an
[1:18:29] emotional being. God made you emotional.
[1:18:31] He made you with the capability of
[1:18:33] loving, uh, the capability of crying, of
[1:18:35] feeling dread, of feeling anxiety, of
[1:18:38] feeling, um, anxiety can be kind of good
[1:18:41] sometimes, right? Because it can keep
[1:18:42] you sharp. That's the point. We don't
[1:18:44] really talk about anxiety where he's
[1:18:46] like, "Lord, free me of anxiety. Free me
[1:18:47] of anxiety." There is a spiritual
[1:18:49] warfare where a spirit, an evil spirit,
[1:18:51] will plague you with anxiety. But
[1:18:52] sometimes if you're nervous before a
[1:18:55] business meeting or a job interview,
[1:18:56] that's going to keep you sharp. I don't
[1:18:58] think you should be praying that away.
[1:19:04] Hello. You need to be sharp. And
[1:19:07] nervousness. I Every time that I've been
[1:19:09] on a cliff, rock climbing, um, you know
[1:19:11] what I'm talking about. I am nervous.
[1:19:14] And I'm looking over this cliff. I'm
[1:19:15] actually afraid of heights. I am deathly
[1:19:18] afraid of heights. That's why I started
[1:19:20] rock climbing because I was like, I want
[1:19:23] to I want to I I don't want the I don't
[1:19:24] want to be like this. I'm going to grow.
[1:19:26] So, I started rock climbing. So, I'm
[1:19:27] hanging off of I'm standing over a cliff
[1:19:29] looking way down with a rope and I'm
[1:19:32] looking wi way down because we need
[1:19:35] ropes. Can I get an amen?
[1:19:38] Uh, so I'm standing there with a rope
[1:19:40] and I'm looking down and uh you feel
[1:19:43] nervous. You kind of need to feel
[1:19:45] nervous and anxious there because if you
[1:19:47] don't have any fear, you're going to be
[1:19:49] like and you're gonna you're gonna you
[1:19:51] don't want to do that. So, sometimes we
[1:19:54] pray, Lord, free me of this anxiety.
[1:19:55] There is a real plaguing anxiety that is
[1:19:58] unhealthy and you you need to get a hold
[1:20:01] of that and you need to be able to know
[1:20:03] and be able to discern Satan you will
[1:20:06] not plague
[1:20:08] me but you also have to be able to
[1:20:10] understand I'm nervous before this job
[1:20:12] interview because I care about doing a
[1:20:14] good job and that will keep you sharp
[1:20:16] and it will keep you focused. So
[1:20:18] sometimes I think we we focus on you
[1:20:20] know um uh uh the emotion around it. And
[1:20:24] I I I also too I feel uh um I I felt so
[1:20:29] brokenhearted when I was young when um u
[1:20:33] you know I think often
[1:20:37] times the devil doesn't have to do
[1:20:41] anything because we're doing enough.
[1:20:44] We're doing enough.
[1:20:46] I was I prayed for um someone in
[1:20:50] uh another country and um he he was
[1:20:54] there and he was you know saying Lord
[1:20:56] you know brother I need I need prayer
[1:20:58] for this this uh I've got real you know
[1:21:00] I just feel horrible I'm you know I've
[1:21:02] got all this in my blood I've got blood
[1:21:03] work and real real bad problem and I
[1:21:05] said okay okay I said do you you do you
[1:21:07] have sugar diabetes and he said yeah
[1:21:08] yeah I've got I've got sugar diabetes I
[1:21:10] said okay wow and you're feeling really
[1:21:12] really bad and uh you you you're you're
[1:21:14] that's a That's horrible. And I and I
[1:21:16] began to ask him and um I knew a little
[1:21:19] bit of the situation. Uh but I so I
[1:21:21] asked him I said, "Hey, I'm just
[1:21:23] curious. What did you eat this morning?"
[1:21:26] He said, "Well, uh uh uh well well uh
[1:21:31] like we like it was we were, you know,
[1:21:34] like we had we were in a rush and so
[1:21:36] like the gravy and the biscuits and
[1:21:38] everything. It was like I I didn't
[1:21:39] really have any other options. So, I I
[1:21:41] had to have, you know, and and then the
[1:21:43] large sweet tea that I had with the
[1:21:45] biscuits and gravy were I mean, they was
[1:21:47] uh came with the meal. So, naturally,
[1:21:50] I'm going to I need you and I'm not
[1:21:52] making a mockery of him, but I looked at
[1:21:54] him. I said,
[1:21:55] "Bro, you caused that. You're sitting
[1:21:59] here with a physical ailment that you
[1:22:01] caused. You know, you shouldn't be
[1:22:02] eating that stuff. Why are you eating
[1:22:04] it? Don't eat the food. Eat healthier
[1:22:07] and you'll feel better."
[1:22:09] And I said, "God is gracious, however,
[1:22:13] that even in your mistake, he will heal
[1:22:17] you right here on the spot." I said,
[1:22:19] "But here's the one thing. Let's pray
[1:22:21] for healing that God would would heal
[1:22:23] that how you how you feel. Bring
[1:22:25] deliverance from that." But I said,
[1:22:27] "You're going to have to go back and
[1:22:28] you're going to have to learn how to eat
[1:22:30] healthy. And you need to be disciplined
[1:22:31] enough to do that because you can't do
[1:22:33] whatever you want because you're going
[1:22:34] to pass out on the floor." So I said,
[1:22:37] "We need to act. Let's pray for
[1:22:38] deliverance here, but you need to eat
[1:22:40] healthy and don't come to the altar
[1:22:42] every time you drink a large sweet tea
[1:22:44] and you're saying, "Oh, the devil's on
[1:22:46] me. The devil's on me." He didn't have
[1:22:48] to do
[1:22:49] anything. The devil's standing back and
[1:22:51] saying, "This guy's he he's doing pretty
[1:22:54] well on on his
[1:22:55] own." Sometimes we can overspiritualize
[1:22:59] and, you know, we can have, you know, we
[1:23:01] need a I need that that demon prayed off
[1:23:04] of me. And a lot of times it could be
[1:23:08] right. But there may also be a
[1:23:12] situation where we need to apply the
[1:23:15] principles of the word that he's already
[1:23:16] given us.
[1:23:19] That's an important concept. I want you
[1:23:21] to understand that we we want to feel
[1:23:25] brother Vanam preached it. We are
[1:23:27] created to accomplish things. As human
[1:23:30] beings, we are created to accomplish
[1:23:32] things. So, you want to accomplish the
[1:23:35] baptism of the Holy Spirit. You want to
[1:23:38] accomplish being an overcoming
[1:23:41] Christian. You want to you want to
[1:23:43] achieve it. You want to do it. I want to
[1:23:45] be that kind of a person. And so,
[1:23:47] naturally in my brain, I was creating a
[1:23:50] formula. And I was I was going through
[1:23:52] the motions to get the feeling that I
[1:23:55] wanted. So that when I had the feeling,
[1:23:57] then I would feel like a Christian when
[1:23:59] God is not a feeling.
[1:24:02] But when you are around God, you feel
[1:24:06] things.
[1:24:08] Were you Did you feel the presence of
[1:24:09] the Lord last night? Just soaking in his
[1:24:12] presence. The Lord was working with
[1:24:13] individuals. That's the be that is so
[1:24:16] beautiful. That is not wrong. We should
[1:24:19] be joyous in that. We should never try
[1:24:22] to manufacture it. We should create an
[1:24:24] atmosphere. I think musicians who um uh
[1:24:27] like like you have are able to craft an
[1:24:32] atmosphere and invite the Holy Spirit.
[1:24:35] They don't create that feeling in you.
[1:24:37] They shouldn't and they don't. They're
[1:24:38] because they're good musicians. God
[1:24:41] creates that feeling in you. But God
[1:24:43] himself is not the feeling. So when you
[1:24:46] pursue the the Holy Spirit or you want
[1:24:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or you
[1:24:50] want
[1:24:51] deliverance, you cannot think of him as
[1:24:55] well if I go to the altar and I feel or
[1:24:57] I have this reaction then that means
[1:25:00] deliverance or that means the baptism of
[1:25:03] the Holy Spirit.
[1:25:06] He is life
[1:25:08] and feeling emotion will deplete you of
[1:25:11] calories.
[1:25:13] Do you understand? Anybody see brother
[1:25:16] Matt last night? He was depleted of
[1:25:18] calories
[1:25:20] because he's in the presence of the of
[1:25:21] of the Lord. And that is emotional. It
[1:25:25] drains you. That's why people had to
[1:25:27] stand behind brother Brandham and hold
[1:25:28] him up is because it's emotional. You
[1:25:30] feel it. That's a beautiful thing.
[1:25:32] That's a wonderful thing. We should
[1:25:34] always want that. Ain't nobody want
[1:25:37] stiff neck churches. I don't want a
[1:25:39] boring church. I I said that to our
[1:25:42] church recently and um uh the the things
[1:25:45] I say to my church, they have such
[1:25:46] grace. I said uh I said, "I don't want
[1:25:49] to go to a boring church." I said, "I
[1:25:51] don't know about any of you, I don't
[1:25:53] want a boring church. Let's let's then
[1:25:56] craft the kind of church that we want by
[1:25:59] the leading of the Holy Spirit." Because
[1:26:01] if this is all about me and what Brother
[1:26:03] Steve wants, then we're missing what God
[1:26:06] would want.
[1:26:07] So I said you you are you are a large
[1:26:10] part of what this church will be. So
[1:26:13] press into it. Worship the Lord. Feel
[1:26:16] open. Feel free in the presence of the
[1:26:18] Holy Spirit. I said if it's just about
[1:26:20] me coming and spitting for an hour every
[1:26:22] Sunday and and Wednesday night, then
[1:26:23] we're in trouble. You've got to you've
[1:26:26] got to press into your church, your
[1:26:29] culture. You've got to press into it
[1:26:32] because you are a big part in ensuring
[1:26:34] that it is accountable to health
[1:26:38] and
[1:26:39] health is in accordance with the word of
[1:26:42] God. Church communities can be
[1:26:45] unhealthy. They can be sick. Remember
[1:26:46] what I said yesterday. If you think that
[1:26:48] the message of the hour is your church
[1:26:50] culture or the church building itself,
[1:26:52] then when it breaks, you will break with
[1:26:54] it.
[1:26:55] You have to have something else, a token
[1:26:58] applied that will anchor you so that if
[1:27:01] there is trouble in the church, you
[1:27:03] won't fall with it. There was a brother
[1:27:06] who came to me and uh he went to a
[1:27:08] church in the south. The pastor left the
[1:27:10] message, long time in the message. And
[1:27:13] this young brother, he goes to my church
[1:27:15] and he said, "You know what? was I you
[1:27:18] know I went to I went to that man's
[1:27:20] church for so long and I and he said do
[1:27:22] I you know do I do I have it was I was I
[1:27:25] where I should be you know if if he
[1:27:27] didn't you know clearly didn't believe
[1:27:29] uh what he was preaching well and you
[1:27:31] know I said well no I think he did
[1:27:32] believe what he was preaching right I
[1:27:36] believe there was a lot of things that
[1:27:37] happened different story different
[1:27:38] conversation uh but I said he he was
[1:27:41] wondering like you know should I have
[1:27:42] been there and I said you know what
[1:27:42] gifts and callings are without
[1:27:44] repentance and I said the important
[1:27:46] thing was you, not not him necessarily,
[1:27:49] not his ministry, not him. You were the
[1:27:52] sheep and God was after you. So God
[1:27:54] would use a gift for even a period of
[1:27:57] time to speak to you to bring you where
[1:27:59] you needed to be. And you are not there.
[1:28:01] You didn't follow him. You are here. You
[1:28:04] are still pressing on in the truth
[1:28:05] because you know the truth and the truth
[1:28:06] is anchored in you. So don't look back
[1:28:08] and say, "Well, it was a mistake to go
[1:28:10] to his church." No, you found yourself
[1:28:12] there. The Lord led you there. That's
[1:28:14] what happened. And by God's grace, he
[1:28:16] used a gift to speak to you where you
[1:28:18] were. So press on in the truth. Don't
[1:28:20] follow that guy. Don't follow a
[1:28:23] scoffer's message. I have no I I really
[1:28:25] don't have any problem with um uh I have
[1:28:28] a great problem with what they say. But
[1:28:30] I don't I don't struggle with believe
[1:28:32] the sign stuff. Um I really don't. And
[1:28:34] here's why. Because I know the guys.
[1:28:38] I know the guys behind it. And they are
[1:28:41] hurt, broken, confused men.
[1:28:44] And here's how I
[1:28:46] know. What do they what have they ever
[1:28:48] pointed us to?
[1:28:51] They tear down and they dismantle and
[1:28:54] they
[1:28:55] confuse and they cause questions and
[1:28:59] they never point you to something
[1:29:01] greater. That is not the Holy Spirit.
[1:29:04] That is what that is scripturally is a
[1:29:07] scoffer's message. So if you have a
[1:29:09] question about what is the truth,
[1:29:11] definitely don't go to a scoffer because
[1:29:13] he doesn't know. All he does is tear
[1:29:15] down. So I've never really struggled
[1:29:18] with, you know, um well, you know,
[1:29:20] brother this and I'm like those guys are
[1:29:23] hurt. And I say this with all respect.
[1:29:26] They're hurt, broken, and confused men
[1:29:28] who are tearing down and pointing you to
[1:29:31] nothing. So you're going to be lost as
[1:29:33] lost as all get out if you listen to a
[1:29:35] scoffer's message. Yeah. So you don't
[1:29:37] really have to have anything to do with
[1:29:38] it. Brother Brandham points you back to
[1:29:40] the scripture and says this is the way.
[1:29:42] This Christ is the life. So get the
[1:29:45] life. That was a messenger pointing your
[1:29:47] heart back to the faith of the
[1:29:48] Pentecostal fathers. And those men
[1:29:50] scoffers point you to nothing. You know
[1:29:53] where the spirit of the Lord is, there
[1:29:54] is liberty. Meaning I can do whatever I
[1:29:57] want and call myself a Christian.
[1:30:00] Don't listen to a scoffer's message. The
[1:30:02] Holy Ghost is not a feeling. It is not a
[1:30:06] a a set of doctrinal or a set of
[1:30:09] actions. The Holy Spirit is the person
[1:30:12] of the Lord Jesus Christ. So when you
[1:30:14] have the baptism of the Holy Spirit, you
[1:30:17] have Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:30:20] Do you understand? You have the very
[1:30:22] life of Christ, you have
[1:30:25] him. And with that can come emotion.
[1:30:31] Yes. Yes. Now, I also think that it's
[1:30:34] important to understand this. You do not
[1:30:36] get the Holy Ghost when you believe. You
[1:30:39] don't believe to get the Holy Ghost. It
[1:30:41] is a gift of God. Now, here's the really
[1:30:45] important part. We've heard the term
[1:30:46] legalism come up a few times, and I
[1:30:48] don't know why, but I' I've heard it
[1:30:49] just pop up even in in myself. I'm I'm
[1:30:52] not even thinking about it. It's not
[1:30:53] even in my notes, and I it keeps popping
[1:30:55] up. So, I don't know why that's the
[1:30:56] case, but I think maybe there's a lot of
[1:30:58] um uh I mean, this was in my
[1:31:01] notes a month ago um uh to talk about
[1:31:05] this specifically, and I I I feel like
[1:31:08] um not legalism, but to to talk about
[1:31:10] this specifically, and I want you to
[1:31:11] really understand this. Everybody with
[1:31:13] me? You do not get the Holy
[1:31:17] Ghost. He gets you. Amen.
[1:31:21] You have to understand that we do not
[1:31:24] believe a worksbased religion. Buddhism,
[1:31:26] Hinduism. I've st I've stood in Buddhist
[1:31:28] temples and uh Hindu temples. Blood from
[1:31:31] the goat still running underneath my my
[1:31:33] shoes. Um uh I've I've you know I've
[1:31:36] talked to I I have a a few friends who
[1:31:39] are Muslims. Fantastic guys. I talked to
[1:31:42] um you know I had a few friends from my
[1:31:44] my boy scout troop uh who are are
[1:31:47] Baptists and I got to know them and um
[1:31:50] uh I I I think they would say the same
[1:31:53] thing but I use them to keep me sharp
[1:31:55] because we debate all the time
[1:31:57] scripturally and I love it. I love
[1:31:59] talking to them. They're really good
[1:32:00] guys. Um, and and we uh I I I've I feel
[1:32:04] there's something in their life and I
[1:32:05] just we just talk and um and so I I want
[1:32:11] you to understand that we do not have a
[1:32:13] works-based
[1:32:15] religion. It is not by your works that
[1:32:17] you are
[1:32:19] saved. So there is no
[1:32:22] work that can give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:28] There is no work that can give you the
[1:32:30] Holy
[1:32:31] Ghost. There is a choice. There is a
[1:32:34] decision. Brother Brandon would preach
[1:32:36] that multiple times in the in the time
[1:32:39] of decision. There is a decision, but
[1:32:42] you cannot get or or take off as if it's
[1:32:45] something on a on a shelf that you pick
[1:32:48] up and say, "Okay, now I've got it. I'm
[1:32:49] going to have it. Now I'm going to
[1:32:50] walk." It's it's not that. It is the
[1:32:53] person of it is a gift from God himself.
[1:32:58] So I want you to really understand that
[1:33:00] this is not something that you reach up
[1:33:02] and grab and say, "Okay, now I've got
[1:33:03] it." This is something that is a gift
[1:33:06] from God to you.
[1:33:09] He gives you the Holy
[1:33:12] Ghost. Do you understand? There is a
[1:33:15] decision that you make. You're on the
[1:33:16] basis of free moral agency. You have to
[1:33:19] come to the Jordan River and walk
[1:33:20] across. You have to be willing to
[1:33:22] receive it and open your heart to
[1:33:24] receive it. But you don't pick, you
[1:33:26] reach up and grab it and say, "I'm going
[1:33:27] to take it. It's now mine." It is the
[1:33:30] gift of the Holy Spirit. It is a
[1:33:32] supernatural work of God that he gives
[1:33:35] to you.
[1:33:37] It is not of works, lest any one of us
[1:33:39] in this room should boast that we got
[1:33:41] it. It is a gift of God to you
[1:33:48] supernaturally. It's an amazing thing.
[1:33:50] Amen. Now, keep that in your mind.
[1:33:51] Understand that it is a gift of God.
[1:33:54] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:33:56] you believed? Now, you cannot believe. I
[1:33:59] love this phrase. You do not you you
[1:34:00] don't believe to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:02] There is no life in belief. Um, we were
[1:34:05] just talking about this. There is no
[1:34:07] life in
[1:34:08] belief. Belief is placing your
[1:34:12] faith in that which has the life, which
[1:34:16] is Christ, the word. But just believing
[1:34:20] there is no life in it, right? I believe
[1:34:23] that there, you know, is a million
[1:34:25] dollars out there, but I don't have it
[1:34:27] right in front of me, right? So, I
[1:34:30] believe that there's a million dollars,
[1:34:32] but it's not really doing me any good
[1:34:33] because it's not really right. I can't
[1:34:35] fill my pockets full of
[1:34:36] it unless anyone has a million dollars
[1:34:39] uh that you could bring up
[1:34:41] here. Uh you
[1:34:44] understand belief has no life. The
[1:34:47] devils believe that the Lord is one
[1:34:50] Lord, but they don't have the life of
[1:34:52] God in them.
[1:34:54] You understand? Believing and
[1:34:56] understanding and looking at the
[1:34:58] minister and looking at the word and
[1:35:00] seeing all of these things, that's
[1:35:01] wonderful. That is necessary. You must
[1:35:04] believe. Believers believe. So, you've
[1:35:07] got to believe. But believing is placing
[1:35:09] your faith in that which is the life
[1:35:14] which is Christ, the person of the Lord
[1:35:16] Jesus Christ. And he gave us his written
[1:35:18] word which is the road map which is
[1:35:20] where the prophet pointed us back to so
[1:35:23] that when the word and the Holy Ghost be
[1:35:26] come together, it quickens life. Amen.
[1:35:30] He pointed he pointed me back to the
[1:35:33] scripture, not a a a seminary version of
[1:35:36] theology that said now you come to the
[1:35:38] front, you do this, you put your name
[1:35:40] on, you understand the phraseology, you
[1:35:41] put your name on the book, and then you
[1:35:43] will be saved. You'll be in the church.
[1:35:45] It's not
[1:35:47] that. It's remember the quote we read
[1:35:50] yesterday. It is God give taking the
[1:35:52] word and giving it to
[1:35:56] you. It is a gift of the Holy Spirit.
[1:36:00] You
[1:36:00] believe for the Holy Ghost, but the Holy
[1:36:04] Ghost is the life. So, you've got you
[1:36:08] can't just have the bucket of blood in
[1:36:09] your hand. You've got to apply it. The
[1:36:11] Holy Ghost has to be in you. And it is
[1:36:15] not something that you pluck off a tree
[1:36:18] and have. It is the gift of the Holy
[1:36:22] Spirit. Now, why do I say that?
[1:36:24] If you look in Acts chapter um two and I
[1:36:28] actually spent some extensive time going
[1:36:30] through this um all of you know the the
[1:36:33] extensive literature in the message
[1:36:35] about it right all the different times
[1:36:36] brother Brandham mentions it the baptism
[1:36:38] of the Holy Spirit baptism of the Holy
[1:36:39] Ghost all these different things but
[1:36:40] then I was looking in Acts and I noticed
[1:36:42] I noticed something and I I mentioned
[1:36:44] this briefly yesterday but there's an
[1:36:46] interesting thing that happens in Acts
[1:36:47] because now again going back to the Holy
[1:36:50] Spirit is not an emotion but when you
[1:36:52] have the Holy Spirit emotion comes
[1:36:55] in different ways. It looks different.
[1:36:57] The reason I say that is because if you
[1:36:59] look in Acts, you look in Acts 2, you
[1:37:01] look in Acts 8, Acts 10, Acts 19. In
[1:37:05] every case where somebody received the
[1:37:07] Holy Spirit, you know what was
[1:37:08] interesting to me is that it was
[1:37:10] different. So sometimes Paul was praying
[1:37:13] and there appeared unto them cloven
[1:37:15] tongues as like a fire and it sat upon
[1:37:17] each of them and they were all filled
[1:37:19] with the Holy Ghost. never happened
[1:37:21] again like that in all of scripture
[1:37:23] where the Holy Spirit broken what it was
[1:37:25] symbolizing was Christ becoming a many
[1:37:27] membered bride breaking apart and
[1:37:30] falling on each one that's why you bring
[1:37:31] your little lick of fire um um brother
[1:37:34] was mentioning that this morning was
[1:37:36] bringing this little lick of fire and
[1:37:38] that's that's what happened it appeared
[1:37:40] in that form Acts chapter 8 they that
[1:37:43] they might receive the Holy Ghost for as
[1:37:44] it was fallen upon them and only they
[1:37:47] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:37:48] Jesus and they laid their hands on them
[1:37:51] and they received the Holy Ghost. So
[1:37:53] before they were just singing in the
[1:37:55] upper room, these people they were laid
[1:37:56] hands on and they received the baptism
[1:37:58] of the Holy Ghost. Everybody with me?
[1:38:00] Acts chapter 10. While Peter spake the
[1:38:03] words very similar to this, the Holy
[1:38:06] Ghost fell on them which heard the word.
[1:38:09] Yes. So they weren't doing anything
[1:38:11] except listening and pressing in and the
[1:38:14] Holy Ghost fell on them. Acts chapter
[1:38:15] 19. And when Paul had laid his hands
[1:38:18] upon them, the Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:38:20] them. So there's some similarities in
[1:38:22] it, but there was never a direct or
[1:38:24] definitive pattern of okay, you have to
[1:38:26] stand at you have to stand right here.
[1:38:28] Um the the the chief pastor, the chief
[1:38:31] priest has to um chief preacher um has
[1:38:33] to lay his hands on you um and then
[1:38:35] associate ministry comes around and lay
[1:38:37] their hands on on you and then you do
[1:38:38] this and then um when you and then
[1:38:40] you'll speak in tongues and then you'll
[1:38:42] receive the Holy Spirit. Brother
[1:38:43] Brandham spent so much time dealing with
[1:38:45] Pentecostalism that was trying to turn
[1:38:47] it into a formula, right? They were
[1:38:50] cherrypicking a scripture and placing it
[1:38:52] directly with the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:54] Spirit and saying that Christ in you and
[1:38:56] filling you is this formula. And brother
[1:39:00] Brandham fought that hard
[1:39:03] and you have to too. Here's the
[1:39:05] similarity between all of these if you
[1:39:07] haven't already noticed
[1:39:09] it. And they were all filled with the
[1:39:12] Holy
[1:39:13] Ghost. And they were all baptized in the
[1:39:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And they
[1:39:17] received the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost
[1:39:22] fell. The Holy Ghost came on them. Yes.
[1:39:27] It was not their work. The Holy Ghost
[1:39:32] fell.
[1:39:35] He
[1:39:37] filled. Now they were in a position of
[1:39:40] receiving. They wanted it. And for some
[1:39:44] they were laid hands on. For some they
[1:39:46] they were just sitting just like you are
[1:39:48] right now. And
[1:39:50] God
[1:39:53] filled. God
[1:39:55] came. God did that
[1:39:58] work. It was a supernatural thing. It
[1:40:03] was not of a work lest any one of these
[1:40:06] people should have boasted.
[1:40:08] I want you to really lay this solid in
[1:40:11] your heart. The baptism of the Holy
[1:40:13] Ghost is not a work of
[1:40:16] man. It is a work of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:20] himself in you. He quickens you. He
[1:40:26] changes you. It is his life coming into
[1:40:31] you and dwelling in your soul
[1:40:34] supernaturally.
[1:40:39] when that happens. Now, the precise
[1:40:43] nature of it. Brother Ron, I've always
[1:40:44] wondered about this, the precise na the
[1:40:48] the nature when it happens, when it when
[1:40:50] he fills you, when it comes in and I my
[1:40:53] mind always goes to the science of it. I
[1:40:55] want to know the science of it. And I re
[1:40:57] I realized one day I was searching in
[1:40:59] the message and all these different
[1:41:00] things. I realized one day, oh, it's
[1:41:04] really simple. God is actually revealing
[1:41:07] himself in simplicity to you. Go right
[1:41:10] back to where brother Brandham said,
[1:41:12] "The new birth, the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:15] Spirit is a personal revelation to you
[1:41:19] of who Jesus Christ is in you."
[1:41:23] Brother Man summarized it so
[1:41:25] beautifully. All these different things
[1:41:27] that the the church evangelical
[1:41:29] community was going in this direction
[1:41:30] formula all of these different things.
[1:41:32] You got to have this emotion. You got to
[1:41:33] feel this. I got to feel like I and then
[1:41:35] I then I won't make any more mistakes
[1:41:36] and then I'll do all these different
[1:41:37] things. Brother Brandon comes right and
[1:41:39] said, "No, no, no. It's a personal
[1:41:41] revelation of who Jesus Christ is to
[1:41:44] you. He falls on
[1:41:48] you. It is not a work of man. It is not
[1:41:51] your work. It is God's work."
[1:41:54] Justification and sanctification are
[1:41:57] also a work of God. But you have a part
[1:41:59] to play in that. you believe in the name
[1:42:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ, right? You
[1:42:04] repent and be baptized. Uh it's that's
[1:42:07] the the premise of Acts 32. So
[1:42:09] justification and sanctification are you
[1:42:12] have a big part to play in those. But
[1:42:13] the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a
[1:42:16] supernatural work of God in
[1:42:19] you. That's the difference. That's the
[1:42:21] oil. He Christ is the oil. And when he
[1:42:26] is on the inside of you, remember now
[1:42:29] what we were talking about yesterday. It
[1:42:30] is now my identification is in what
[1:42:32] Christ did for me, not in my flesh. I
[1:42:36] was crucified with Christ, yet I no
[1:42:39] longer live. It is Christ who lives in
[1:42:42] me. Do you
[1:42:44] understand? The baptism of the Holy
[1:42:46] Spirit is not complicated. It is Christ
[1:42:49] in you, the hope of glory. Now, let's
[1:42:54] look at this.
[1:42:56] We're baptized by one spirit, but what's
[1:42:58] the evidence of it? Now, Brother Bham,
[1:43:01] he he I I'm I'm just going to skip over
[1:43:03] a few um quotes here because I I just I
[1:43:06] really want to um I really want to nail
[1:43:09] this down uh for for us this morning. Is
[1:43:13] this okay, everybody? Good.
[1:43:17] This one is a good one. You don't get
[1:43:19] the Holy Ghost with some psychic workup.
[1:43:21] The Holy Ghost is a gift of God. These
[1:43:22] are really good quotes. Uh, I w I wish I
[1:43:25] um I I just let's let's let's keep keep
[1:43:28] going here. Um but I I want you to I
[1:43:32] want you to lay this concept in your
[1:43:34] heart because we know okay what it is
[1:43:36] now. How do I get it right? How how do I
[1:43:39] get the Holy Spirit? Now this is the
[1:43:41] amazing
[1:43:42] thing. Isaiah 55, the word shall not
[1:43:46] return unto him void. And if you were
[1:43:49] predestinated, which I believe you
[1:43:51] are, you were in the mind of God before
[1:43:54] the foundation of the world and you were
[1:43:56] always into him. And when he
[1:43:59] supernaturally fills, when the Holy
[1:44:01] Ghost falls, when he comes, he quickens
[1:44:06] that that eternal seed that was on the
[1:44:09] inside. It's flesh of his flesh and bone
[1:44:11] of his bone. You were in Christ before
[1:44:14] the foundation of the world in the
[1:44:16] Lamb's book of life. The law of life and
[1:44:19] death was actually set in order before
[1:44:21] there ever was an earth. So God had the
[1:44:23] idea of death because new life can only
[1:44:26] come from death. So when you receive the
[1:44:28] baptism of the Holy Spirit, that's why
[1:44:30] Jordan's river symbolizing death to self
[1:44:33] precedes it because you've got to come
[1:44:36] to a death to yourself. Now, I'm not so
[1:44:38] focusing on on justification and
[1:44:41] sanctification this morning, but I want
[1:44:43] you to understand that death is
[1:44:45] extremely important because new life
[1:44:47] comes from death. So, so David said
[1:44:51] this, whether shall I go from thy spirit
[1:44:53] and whether shall I flee from thy
[1:44:55] presence? If I ascend up into heaven,
[1:44:57] thou art there. If I make my bed in
[1:44:59] hell, behold, thou art there. Wherever
[1:45:01] you go, the Lord will find you. You
[1:45:05] cannot go anywhere. You cannot get so um
[1:45:08] as the uh uh uh as you've heard so many
[1:45:12] times, you can't go so far that God
[1:45:14] can't find you. I believe that with all
[1:45:16] my heart. I have to believe that. I
[1:45:18] don't have any other recourse that God
[1:45:20] would find me and and and change my life
[1:45:23] even when I am running in the opposite
[1:45:25] direction or or going in this direction.
[1:45:27] He he he came after me. The lost sheep
[1:45:30] that was wandering around. He comes
[1:45:32] after you. He cares about you. He wants
[1:45:35] you to have the Holy Spirit. This is not
[1:45:37] something that is beyond your reach. He
[1:45:40] wants to give it to you. He wants to
[1:45:43] fall. He wants to come and fill you with
[1:45:45] his presence. He wants to change you. He
[1:45:49] wants you to be there when he comes to
[1:45:51] get his bride. So he wants to fill you.
[1:45:54] Don't think that this is for someone
[1:45:56] else out there. This is for you. He
[1:45:59] wants you to have the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:02] You got to personalize this. Don't think
[1:46:05] that you're not worthy of it. Ain't
[1:46:07] nobody in this room worthy of it. It is
[1:46:09] a gift of the Holy Spirit. He comes to
[1:46:13] you.
[1:46:14] He falls. You did not make yourself
[1:46:18] worthy. You cannot make yourself worthy
[1:46:21] of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. You
[1:46:23] say, "Lord, I want it. I need it." You
[1:46:27] come to a place where you're you you're
[1:46:29] walked across Jordan. Your legs are wet
[1:46:31] with the
[1:46:32] water. and he he fills you. Amen.
[1:46:38] You cannot escape the presence of God.
[1:46:40] Now, how do you get it? And this is
[1:46:41] really really interesting. Brother
[1:46:43] Benam, he says, "If you haven't got it
[1:46:46] by night time," and he I just paraphrase
[1:46:48] now here, but he says, "There's many in
[1:46:50] here seeking the Holy Ghost and the
[1:46:52] thing you want to do is to not let this
[1:46:55] night go by until you receive it." Now,
[1:46:58] that's a prophet of God. So if he makes
[1:47:00] that statement, that's a pretty bold
[1:47:01] statement because that means that you
[1:47:03] can have it. Now remember, it's not
[1:47:06] something that you just pluck off of a
[1:47:07] tree. The Holy Ghost falls, but he wants
[1:47:10] to come to you.
[1:47:12] He wants to He wants you. He wants to
[1:47:16] give you life
[1:47:19] everlasting. So you can be in a place
[1:47:21] where you say, "Lord, I'm going to I'm
[1:47:23] going to wait right here until you come
[1:47:25] and you do that work. ma take every
[1:47:28] wicked way out of my life. Take it I I I
[1:47:31] repent. I'm I I I I I know that I make
[1:47:34] mistakes and that I have, but right
[1:47:36] where I am, I I want you to come and
[1:47:37] feel me. I want your supernatural
[1:47:40] life. Now, stay there until you get it.
[1:47:45] But I I want you to understand this in
[1:47:47] Lukeap 11. This is the primary
[1:47:49] scripture. If you then being evil know
[1:47:52] how to give good gifts unto your
[1:47:54] children, dads giving gifts to their
[1:47:55] children. My dad never gave me a gift.
[1:47:57] So I I I I don't know who's given who
[1:48:00] gifts, but you know, my dad never just
[1:48:02] walked up and say, "This is for you,
[1:48:03] Steve." Um, he did, but I'm just
[1:48:06] paraphrasing, but in this passage, he
[1:48:08] said, "If if father natural fathers know
[1:48:09] how to give gifts to the children,
[1:48:12] right? How much more shall your heavenly
[1:48:14] father give the Holy Spirit to them that
[1:48:18] ask him?" Do you know how monumental
[1:48:20] this scripture is? This settles a lot
[1:48:22] for me. This settled so much for me in
[1:48:24] my mind because I was asking him and he
[1:48:29] gave it to me.
[1:48:31] I asked him and he gave it to me. I
[1:48:35] didn't really know what I was asking
[1:48:37] for, but I asked. I pursued. I was
[1:48:40] there. I was pressing in and he came and
[1:48:44] he filled me. I was standing out by a
[1:48:47] tree. I was hunting. Sounds so
[1:48:48] spiritual, but I just happened to be
[1:48:51] hunting. Um and um I was out I was there
[1:48:54] and I I had really given the my heart to
[1:48:57] the Lord. Uh and and the Lord was really
[1:49:00] working in me and I I I it wasn't this
[1:49:03] scripture. Um but I came um I came to
[1:49:06] Colossians where it says uh set your
[1:49:08] affections on things that are above not
[1:49:10] on things that are on earth. And I I
[1:49:12] remember just sitting there by that tree
[1:49:13] and I was going you know I was going
[1:49:14] through a fairly difficult time
[1:49:17] um of just decisions and things like
[1:49:20] that. But I remember just praying. Um I
[1:49:24] shot a deer that way that day by the
[1:49:25] way. Um it's fantastic day. But I I was
[1:49:29] I was just praying and I
[1:49:30] was just working things
[1:49:34] out and I remember saying,
[1:49:37] "Lord, I want the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:40] Spirit." I knew that I didn't have
[1:49:42] it. And I didn't know how exactly, but I
[1:49:47] knew. And I said, 'Lord, I want it. And
[1:49:50] I realized I'm trying to set my
[1:49:53] affections on everything else around me
[1:49:54] except setting my affection on him. And
[1:49:57] that verse, it just triggered my
[1:49:58] thinking. And I just I just pressed into
[1:50:01] the Holy Spirit so
[1:50:04] strongly. And just something came over
[1:50:06] me. Um, I can't describe to you. And I I
[1:50:10] I I did I I started to cry. I never got
[1:50:13] up. I never danced around the tree. Um,
[1:50:16] I just started to cry. And I
[1:50:21] realized just so clear as
[1:50:23] Isabelle, it's Christ in me, the hope of
[1:50:26] glory. And I realized my mind went right
[1:50:28] back to that quote. It's a personal
[1:50:30] revelation of who Jesus Christ is to me.
[1:50:33] And I
[1:50:36] realized he has changed
[1:50:39] me. And it just dropped in my in my
[1:50:43] soul. And from that moment on, there's
[1:50:46] been a confidence and an assurance. I
[1:50:50] make mistakes every day, just like
[1:50:53] brother Matt said last night. But from
[1:50:55] that
[1:50:56] moment, I have it's been
[1:50:59] settled. No one can convince me out of
[1:51:01] it because it wasn't my work. I wasn't
[1:51:05] crying at an altar and nobody laid hands
[1:51:07] on me. I was by myself. All I did was
[1:51:09] cry. And the Lord changed me.
[1:51:18] Now, this is really important in um
[1:51:23] uh questions and answers. Uh I want to
[1:51:27] um sorry, not not in questions and
[1:51:29] answers in
[1:51:31] um let me go back
[1:51:33] here. Uh he he he says uh in uh I think
[1:51:38] it's I think it's actually further down,
[1:51:39] so I'll wait until I get there. Um,
[1:51:41] brother Bam, in in the greatest battle I
[1:51:43] ever fought is in the mind. He says that
[1:51:45] it's, you know, God gave you a mind, God
[1:51:48] gave you a spirit, and you take the the
[1:51:51] thought, you take the word and it it
[1:51:54] travels essentially down the channel of
[1:51:57] your thought and God quickens it to
[1:52:00] life.
[1:52:02] So there is you know your brain God gave
[1:52:05] you a brain and you you you hold this
[1:52:09] thought but the thought is not of your
[1:52:11] own. If you hold the
[1:52:14] word then when the word travels down
[1:52:17] your channel of thinking the Holy Spirit
[1:52:20] quickens it to life and then Romans 8:19
[1:52:24] really becomes a reality. The
[1:52:27] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:52:30] Because when the word comes into your
[1:52:32] thinking and you you take that thought
[1:52:33] or you're dealing with something or
[1:52:35] you're you're dealing with a temptation
[1:52:36] and you take the word of God and it
[1:52:39] travels down that channel of your
[1:52:41] thinking, God will quicken that to life
[1:52:44] because it's not you you your your
[1:52:46] thoughts that have life in themselves.
[1:52:48] It is the word of God. It is Christ
[1:52:51] himself. So when the life is grabbed a
[1:52:55] hold of and held, the Holy Spirit
[1:52:58] quickens it to
[1:53:00] reality. That's how greater is he that's
[1:53:02] in you than he that is in the world.
[1:53:05] It's not greater is your ability to
[1:53:07] withstand temptation than he that is in
[1:53:09] the world. Because it won't work that
[1:53:11] way. Greater is he that's in you than he
[1:53:13] that is in the world. Now, how do you
[1:53:15] know that you have the Holy Spirit? We
[1:53:19] know what it is. We know how to get it.
[1:53:23] How do I know that I have it? Now,
[1:53:26] there's a there's a lot of brother man
[1:53:28] deals with this topic so much because I
[1:53:30] believe that out of any prevailing
[1:53:32] question, I think there's two really
[1:53:34] prevailing questions. How do I know that
[1:53:36] I have the baptism of the Holy Spirit?
[1:53:37] How do I know I'm in the perfect will of
[1:53:38] God, especially as a young person? I
[1:53:41] don't know about you, but those are
[1:53:42] oftenimes questions that we can struggle
[1:53:45] with. And how do you know that you have
[1:53:47] it? Brother Matt was talking last night
[1:53:51] and he was talking about that man that
[1:53:54] the Holy Spirit had brought him to
[1:53:56] church for so long. And um and I might
[1:53:59] not do a good job of the story here, but
[1:54:01] um Brother Matt was asking him, "What
[1:54:03] brought you to church all this time?"
[1:54:04] And it was the Holy Spirit. And brother
[1:54:06] Matt, he said, "Do you believe that you
[1:54:08] have the Holy Ghost?" And he said, the
[1:54:09] man raised his hands and he said, "I
[1:54:12] believe I do. Yes." Right? Am I am I
[1:54:14] saying that right? He said, "I believe I
[1:54:15] do. Yes." So he was thinking, "Oh, I've
[1:54:18] got to do all these different things in
[1:54:19] the formula." And all the while there
[1:54:21] was something on the inside of him, a
[1:54:23] life that was being manifested. He was
[1:54:26] struggling. He didn't even want to be in
[1:54:28] church, but there was a life on the
[1:54:30] inside of him that was living outside,
[1:54:33] living the life. That's the grace and
[1:54:36] mercy of Almighty God. Even while where
[1:54:39] his brain was somewhere else, somewhere
[1:54:41] where where it shouldn't have been, the
[1:54:43] Holy Spirit was walking step by step by
[1:54:46] step in that person. So, how do you know
[1:54:48] that you have the the baptism of the
[1:54:50] Holy Ghost? You'll live perfect and you
[1:54:52] won't make a mistake.
[1:54:56] Now, you're smart kids. You all know
[1:54:57] that that isn't the truth.
[1:55:00] So, then why do you let that plague your
[1:55:01] mind
[1:55:03] all the time? You know who that is? Is
[1:55:06] Satan. He's plaguing your mind. Why do
[1:55:09] you let that
[1:55:11] happen? We are aware of Satan's devices.
[1:55:14] So stop him in his tracks. Don't don't
[1:55:16] think that. Here's what brother Bham
[1:55:18] says. There's I'm just going to let the
[1:55:20] let brother say it and and and we'll let
[1:55:23] the scripture set. Okay. There's only
[1:55:25] one evidence of the Holy Spirit that I
[1:55:27] know of and that is the genuine faith.
[1:55:29] Faith is a gift. Faith is the substance
[1:55:33] of the things that we hope for. It's the
[1:55:35] evidence of the things that are unseen.
[1:55:37] it. Faith is a reality. Fear is a
[1:55:40] valless element. There is no substance
[1:55:43] to fear. It is something that may or may
[1:55:46] not
[1:55:47] happen. When perfect love comes, it
[1:55:49] casts out all fear. Christ, God is love.
[1:55:53] So when God comes to you, it casts out
[1:55:55] all fear. Fear is valless. There's
[1:55:57] really no there's no substance to it.
[1:55:59] Faith is substance. There's evidence.
[1:56:04] So in your faith in the promised word of
[1:56:07] the hour, what is the message of the
[1:56:09] hour?
[1:56:12] Please say it louder. What is the
[1:56:14] message of the hour?
[1:56:16] Christ in you, the hope of glory. When
[1:56:18] your faith in the promised word of the
[1:56:21] hour, that's the evidence of the Holy
[1:56:25] Spirit. I love
[1:56:28] that. He
[1:56:30] says in the church age book, "The
[1:56:32] evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:56:34] today is the same as it was in the day
[1:56:36] of our Lord. It is receiving the word of
[1:56:38] truth for the day in which you live."
[1:56:41] Jesus never did stress the importance of
[1:56:43] works as he did the word in receiving
[1:56:46] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and as
[1:56:48] evidence. But rest assured now when you
[1:56:51] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:56:53] there is a life there that desires the
[1:56:58] word.
[1:56:59] And you can make a mistake and you can
[1:57:01] say, "Oh, well, you know, I'm I'm um I
[1:57:04] said this that I shouldn't say." And the
[1:57:05] Holy Spirit will bring you right back to
[1:57:07] where you need to be. Amen. By the grace
[1:57:09] and mercy of God, he'll bring you right
[1:57:11] back to where brother Brandham said that
[1:57:12] there was a keeping power of the Holy
[1:57:14] Spirit. And I believe that when John
[1:57:17] said there is no there is a once you are
[1:57:19] born again baptized remember it is not a
[1:57:22] work of man but he who is born again she
[1:57:25] who is born again they cannot sin in
[1:57:27] other words Christ in you because the
[1:57:30] Holy Ghost falls and it is the word
[1:57:33] that's on the inside of you that's the
[1:57:35] baptism of the Holy Spirit when that
[1:57:37] happens the Holy Spirit in you will
[1:57:39] never disbelieve his own word so there
[1:57:42] is a life that will come holiness ess
[1:57:45] will come. Uh there is a a natural
[1:57:48] tendency to feel dirty around
[1:57:54] sinfulness. Not to the point that we
[1:57:57] can't fulfill the great commission
[1:57:59] because Jesus walked right into
[1:58:01] Matthew's house and Peter was standing
[1:58:03] on the outside looking in. He's saying,
[1:58:06] "How is how what is he doing? What is he
[1:58:10] doing?" And Jesus is sitting right there
[1:58:12] talking to a a a tax collector, sitting
[1:58:16] down having supper with them, sharing
[1:58:18] the gospel with
[1:58:19] them. Now, I don't want you to go home
[1:58:21] and say, "Brother Steve said that we
[1:58:22] should go into a bar and have a beer
[1:58:25] with with someone and share the gospel."
[1:58:27] Don't misunderstand me. Don't put words
[1:58:29] in my
[1:58:30] mouth. There is a natural feeling of
[1:58:34] uneasiness around the world, but you are
[1:58:37] not of the world.
[1:58:40] God pulls you out of the world with the
[1:58:43] baptism of the Holy Spirit, changes you,
[1:58:46] turns you right around, and sends you
[1:58:48] right back out into it to be a witness
[1:58:50] for the truth. Ready to give a hope uh
[1:58:54] ready to give a hope for to to um to
[1:58:57] tell and share of the hope that lith
[1:58:59] within you. You are the only grace that
[1:59:02] some people will see. But if your
[1:59:03] attitude is, well, I'm too clean, you
[1:59:06] know, to to talk to someone who's um,
[1:59:08] you know, uh, not filled with the Holy
[1:59:12] Spirit, you know, I mean, in our church,
[1:59:14] we are clean, we are prim, we are
[1:59:16] proper. So, I I wouldn't be caught I
[1:59:18] wouldn't be caught dead in a Starbucks
[1:59:20] because they believe in
[1:59:22] homosexuality. I remember I was talking
[1:59:24] to a brother came up to me one time and
[1:59:26] he said, you know, I never go to
[1:59:28] Starbucks because they believe in
[1:59:29] homosexuality. And I I I was very young
[1:59:33] and I was it was this is probably not
[1:59:34] the appropriate thing to do, but I
[1:59:36] remember just pulling up his coat jacket
[1:59:38] and the guy who made his suit was a
[1:59:40] homosexual. So I said, "Brother, he
[1:59:44] never came back to me
[1:59:46] again. Never said another word to me
[1:59:49] again." And I I we we we legalism breeds
[1:59:54] hypocrisy. And if we if the Holy Ghost
[1:59:57] if if the evidence of the Holy Ghost is,
[1:59:59] "Oh, I'm clean. I'm proper. They are
[2:00:02] not,
[2:00:03] but I
[2:00:07] am. You
[2:00:10] know, it happens because we make
[2:00:14] mistakes even though we have the life of
[2:00:16] Christ in us. And I think that's one of
[2:00:19] the
[2:00:20] worst to be able to turn back around and
[2:00:22] turn and put your nose up at the world
[2:00:25] when God saved even the likes of you.
[2:00:31] He saved even the likes of you. As black
[2:00:34] a sin as you were, as as horrible of a
[2:00:36] person as I
[2:00:37] was, he saved me. And I would have the
[2:00:41] audacity to withhold that grace and
[2:00:43] goodness from somebody else.
[2:00:46] Is that the best that the holy hol holy
[2:00:48] ghost can produce? If our culture of the
[2:00:50] message community if if the extent to
[2:00:53] what the Holy Ghost has produced in us
[2:00:55] is when somebody walks in in the back
[2:00:56] door with purple hair doesn't know
[2:00:58] anything about the gospel of Jesus
[2:01:00] Christ and they sit in a seat and
[2:01:02] everybody turns their head and goes, "Oh
[2:01:04] my
[2:01:06] goodness, they've got purple hair. They
[2:01:09] don't know any better. But you do."
[2:01:12] That's right. I'm not saying go and get
[2:01:14] purple hair. I'm saying share the gospel
[2:01:16] with that person. And you don't have to
[2:01:19] say, you know, you shouldn't have purple
[2:01:21] hair. You should say, you know,
[2:01:23] something has changed my life. And I
[2:01:25] want to tell you about it. The Holy
[2:01:27] Ghost is life and truth and goodness and
[2:01:32] peace. And you can have the same peace
[2:01:35] that I have. Let me tell you my
[2:01:37] testimony. their hair will take care of
[2:01:39] itself because when they come face to
[2:01:41] face with the word, the word will change
[2:01:44] them. Stop trying to change people. You
[2:01:48] got enough trouble trying to change
[2:01:49] yourself, let the word change
[2:01:52] them. If the best that the message can
[2:01:55] produce is when somebody who is lost
[2:01:57] comes in off the street and we turn up
[2:01:59] our nose at them, shame on us. Thank
[2:02:01] you.
[2:02:03] I believe that there's a generation that
[2:02:05] I'm looking at that will share the
[2:02:08] gospel with courage and goodness and not
[2:02:10] be afraid to feel a little dirty walking
[2:02:13] down a street.
[2:02:16] Is God God in you or is he not? Are you
[2:02:20] so afraid that you would be turned by
[2:02:23] any wind of doctrine tossed to and fro?
[2:02:25] Is that the extent of your experience?
[2:02:29] That you couldn't interact with someone
[2:02:30] who doesn't know the gospel. Are you for
[2:02:33] real? The Holy Ghost is power. The Holy
[2:02:37] Ghost is truth. And when he's in
[2:02:40] you, all things are made new.
[2:02:46] There was a sister who came up to me and
[2:02:47] she goes to university and she said, you
[2:02:49] know, I'm in class and uh she said, you
[2:02:53] know, do I um you know, I don't I don't
[2:02:55] believe what they do. And she wasn't
[2:02:56] there was nothing that was said that was
[2:02:58] specifically wrong, right? Um but she
[2:03:00] said, you know, I don't want to be I
[2:03:02] don't you know, should I be, you know,
[2:03:03] should I be there? And I I said, well,
[2:03:05] why are you going? Why do you feel
[2:03:06] going? And she said, well, I feel I feel
[2:03:08] God wants me to be a nurse. God has put
[2:03:11] a gift in my uh life to to help people
[2:03:14] and I want to do it and I I feel
[2:03:16] specifically led to be a nurse and I've
[2:03:17] got to go through school to get it.
[2:03:19] Going to school is just a piece of
[2:03:20] paper. Sometimes you got to go through
[2:03:22] the hard you got to go and do it so that
[2:03:25] you you can do what God wants you to do
[2:03:27] better because she's not going to be
[2:03:28] able to be a nurse unless she goes to
[2:03:30] school. So she kind of has to go get the
[2:03:31] piece of paper. Unfortunately, that's
[2:03:33] the way the economy works. So she has to
[2:03:34] go get the piece of paper and then go
[2:03:36] and do what God wants her to do and do
[2:03:37] it the best that she possibly can. And I
[2:03:39] said, 'Sister, do you believe that you
[2:03:41] have the Holy Ghost?' And she said,"Of
[2:03:44] course I do." She says, 'I do.' And I
[2:03:47] said, "Um, are you
[2:03:49] afraid of going out and living a
[2:03:53] testimony?" And she said, "Absolutely
[2:03:55] not." And I said, "Go to school and be a
[2:03:58] believer."
[2:04:00] I'm not I'm not just a believer in
[2:04:01] church and then I'm standing in a
[2:04:03] Starbucks and there's someone uh who's
[2:04:06] purple hair uh pants. Oh,
[2:04:09] I I don't do those things. My life was
[2:04:13] changed.
[2:04:14] So, I can stand in a coffee line and
[2:04:17] hold my head up high and say, you know,
[2:04:18] I'm I'm I'm the happiest person on
[2:04:20] earth. I got problems. I got
[2:04:22] difficulties. I got issues, but I'm the
[2:04:24] happiest person on earth. Somebody will
[2:04:25] see that. Somebody will experience that.
[2:04:28] It will change them.
[2:04:38] It's receiving the word of truth for the
[2:04:40] day in which you
[2:04:42] live. The person of the Lord Jesus
[2:04:44] Christ. Amen. Now, I want to share
[2:04:47] something with
[2:04:49] you. A lot of times we think Joshua,
[2:04:52] Ephesians, possession of the land. You
[2:04:55] have the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The
[2:04:57] evidence is faith in the revealed word
[2:05:00] of the hour. The revealed word of the
[2:05:02] hour is Christ made known in you, God. A
[2:05:06] voice out of heaven. Revelations 4:1.
[2:05:08] Revelations 10:8-11. John, come and take
[2:05:11] the
[2:05:12] book. Faith in the revealed word of the
[2:05:14] hour is the evidence of the Holy
[2:05:17] Spirit. It produces a life in you. It
[2:05:20] produces confidence, assurance. You make
[2:05:24] a mistake, he'll bring you right back to
[2:05:26] where you need to be.
[2:05:28] You look to the left, he'll guide you
[2:05:30] and point you right back to where you
[2:05:32] need to be.
[2:05:33] It's the life of Almighty God in you who
[2:05:37] began a good work in you finishing it.
[2:05:40] So let the work of the Lord be done
[2:05:43] because I I can look this way and he'll
[2:05:45] guide me right back to where I need to
[2:05:47] be. We think of
[2:05:50] possession as
[2:05:52] this. I got the Holy
[2:05:54] Ghost. I'm made new. Let's go into the
[2:05:58] land.
[2:05:59] We walk across Jordan and we're in the
[2:06:01] land and oh, it's
[2:06:03] wonderful. Pass the grapes and you get
[2:06:05] the big grape, you know, big grapes and
[2:06:09] you know, here's a grape and you know,
[2:06:12] this is it's wonderful. We're all we all
[2:06:14] have the baptism of the the Holy Spirit.
[2:06:16] It is wonderful. And you you might
[2:06:19] visualize, oh, when I get the Holy Ghost
[2:06:22] and when that life is in me, oh, this is
[2:06:24] what it's going to look like. You know
[2:06:25] what it actually looks like?
[2:06:29] Yes sir.
[2:06:31] When they possessed the
[2:06:33] land, there was warfare.
[2:06:37] It was it was
[2:06:40] hardship. Now they were in the promise.
[2:06:44] The promise was being made
[2:06:46] known. It was the fulfillment of what
[2:06:48] God had had purposed in them. And yet
[2:06:52] the reality of it is they had to pick up
[2:06:54] their sword and they had to lay waste to
[2:06:57] the things that were that were
[2:06:59] surrounding
[2:07:02] them. Now I want to I want you to turn
[2:07:05] with me. Turn with me to
[2:07:13] Jeremiah
[2:07:15] 48. Jeremiah chapter 48. This is a
[2:07:18] passage of scripture that changed my
[2:07:20] life and I want to share it with
[2:07:22] you. Now, we know that in the promised
[2:07:24] land, it looks like it looks pretty
[2:07:28] gruesome. Uh it's it's not all lying on
[2:07:30] a bed of
[2:07:31] roses. Living a Christian life, brother
[2:07:34] would say, the harsh realities of
[2:07:35] everyday living. Living a Christian life
[2:07:38] is hard. You experience temptation. You
[2:07:41] have an enemy that walks about as a
[2:07:42] roaring lion. He is very powerful.
[2:07:46] Uh heard heard somebody say one time
[2:07:48] they said if there ever was a time when
[2:07:50] we need to stir up hell it's right now.
[2:07:52] And I I it I was thinking I was like I
[2:07:55] don't want to stir up hell. I it really
[2:07:58] struck me kind of humorous. I was like I
[2:08:01] kind of would like to let it leave. I
[2:08:02] would like to leave it lying. I don't
[2:08:04] want to stir it up. He's he's he's at
[2:08:07] he's at us all the time. So I don't want
[2:08:10] to you know go in and stir up. You know
[2:08:13] I I realize the context behind it but I
[2:08:14] I That should not be our approach. We
[2:08:18] live we live in the in the promised
[2:08:20] land. The Holy Spirit that is our
[2:08:24] possession. The place of of a believer
[2:08:27] is in the promised land. The baptism of
[2:08:30] the Holy Spirit. And when you have the
[2:08:32] baptism of the Holy
[2:08:34] Spirit, you are
[2:08:36] still flesh and blood. So I have a body,
[2:08:40] I have a spirit, and I have a soul. That
[2:08:42] did not change because I now have the
[2:08:44] life of Christ on the inside of me. My
[2:08:46] soul has been redeemed. I am now made
[2:08:49] new. Old things are passed away. All
[2:08:51] things are made new. Not because of I
[2:08:53] have different blood cells now or I have
[2:08:55] different muscles. Same muscles. It's
[2:08:58] because now the life of God which is the
[2:09:00] seed which is the word which is the
[2:09:02] truth which is the
[2:09:04] reality is now on the inside of me. So
[2:09:07] yet though I
[2:09:08] live Christ lives in me. You understand?
[2:09:13] So, I face the hardships and the reality
[2:09:15] of everyday living with Christ in me,
[2:09:19] the hope of glory. Greater is he that's
[2:09:22] within me than he that's within the
[2:09:23] world. Um, I have this band on my wrist.
[2:09:26] The scripture says, "Bind the word about
[2:09:28] thy neck and bind it about thy wrist."
[2:09:30] So, I have more scripture for it than
[2:09:31] against it, but I I I have this band uh
[2:09:35] because I I found that someone gave it
[2:09:37] to me and it's my favorite verse. I
[2:09:39] could do all things through Christ who
[2:09:41] who gives me strength. I was climbing a
[2:09:42] mountain one time and uh we had just
[2:09:45] stopped and we uh clipped uh and we were
[2:09:47] just standing there and I was at 19,100
[2:09:49] ft. Um and so I was at 19,100 ft. You're
[2:09:53] you're like you're just like you're
[2:09:56] you're not thinking straight. You think
[2:09:57] like a 5-year-old kid. So I'm like and I
[2:10:01] I really struggle at altitude. thought I
[2:10:03] was really and I I'm standing there and
[2:10:05] I'm I'm you know uh just uh trying to to
[2:10:08] gain composure and this guy comes
[2:10:11] by and he's he's coming
[2:10:15] down around the rock in the in the ice
[2:10:18] and he's coming down and he's got no
[2:10:23] legs, but he has no legs. And I This is
[2:10:27] legit. This is seriously happened to me.
[2:10:29] And I was standing there and I'm I'm
[2:10:30] just like and and this guy with no legs
[2:10:34] comes around and he's like, "How you
[2:10:36] doing?" And he comes and he's literally
[2:10:39] on his arms. Now, there's a guy behind
[2:10:40] him short roping him down, but he's not
[2:10:43] doing any of the work. This guy is doing
[2:10:45] all the work. Turns out he's a famous
[2:10:46] Russian climber. He's trying to climb
[2:10:48] all uh uh 14 summits, 8,000 meter
[2:10:51] summits, and he has no legs. So this guy
[2:10:54] is literally and he's got like this
[2:10:55] unique suit and things like that and
[2:10:57] he's climbing around and I I'm
[2:11:00] thinking, "Oh my goodness." I'm like,
[2:11:02] "So I I keep I keep this band because it
[2:11:05] says, "I can do all things through
[2:11:06] Christ who gives me strength." And I was
[2:11:08] literally
[2:11:10] like that's all I got. I don't have
[2:11:13] anything else. I I keep
[2:11:18] another guy. We were at 18,700 ft and he
[2:11:22] uh I come out of my tent and we're on
[2:11:24] this slope and we're just about this is
[2:11:26] right like the day before we make our
[2:11:28] summit bid and he's he's uh uh he's
[2:11:31] there and he gives me this and he made
[2:11:33] it he made this just a little bracelet
[2:11:35] and um he called me pastor Steve because
[2:11:38] he um he knew that I was a Christian and
[2:11:40] he knew that I was a pastor and I would
[2:11:41] always pray before I went up and he he
[2:11:44] I'm I'm a believer here. I'm a believer
[2:11:48] on the mountain. I'm a believer at work.
[2:11:51] I am who I am. Not ashamed of it. I am
[2:11:54] who I am. And so I'm standing there and
[2:11:57] he he gives me this and he said, "Hey,
[2:12:00] every time wear this and every time you
[2:12:02] look at it, pray for me." And I said,
[2:12:06] "Deal." So I I think every time I do
[2:12:09] this, I think of that guy. And I pray
[2:12:10] for him. Uh I don't know where he is. I
[2:12:12] lost touch with him. Um but I pray for
[2:12:15] him. And I keep this I keep this
[2:12:18] scripture verse on my wrist.
[2:12:20] Uh I can do all
[2:12:22] things through Christ who gives me
[2:12:25] strength. There is a keeping power, a
[2:12:29] Holy Ghost power that comes from the
[2:12:32] life of Christ on the inside of you. It
[2:12:35] is not your work. It is God's work. And
[2:12:38] when you want to express your face faith
[2:12:41] with your works, the Holy Spirit will do
[2:12:43] that in you. Now, in Jeremiah chapter
[2:12:47] 48, um there was a prophecy Jeremiah had
[2:12:50] against Moab. Moab obviously Israel's
[2:12:52] longtime en enemy, but Moab was a pagan
[2:12:55] nation. So, it was not bad place. They
[2:12:59] did bad things. They did drugs over
[2:13:00] there. And Moab Moab was um uh a a thorn
[2:13:05] in Israel's side. So, Jeremiah
[2:13:07] pronounces a a curse on them. And Moab
[2:13:11] was actually the descendants of Lot's
[2:13:15] incestrous relationship. Yeah, it was
[2:13:16] really bad. So they're they're um they
[2:13:20] had some things going on over there that
[2:13:21] they need to work on. And so the time
[2:13:24] this is around I think around 600 BC and
[2:13:26] they um they were they were Moab had
[2:13:29] grown really proud and complacent. I
[2:13:31] think their economy was kind of picking
[2:13:32] up just from what I can read in the
[2:13:33] scripture and things like that. And they
[2:13:34] were they were very proud. Uh and they
[2:13:36] were um they that's just kind of who
[2:13:39] they were. So they trusted in their
[2:13:40] wealth
[2:13:41] and Chaoth or Chamoth was their god,
[2:13:44] things like that. So it was it was
[2:13:46] really interesting. And God declares
[2:13:49] judgment upon Moab. So he um he he
[2:13:54] commands, if you're there in Jeremiah
[2:13:56] chapter 48, I told you to turn to it and
[2:13:58] I didn't turn to it.
[2:14:00] Um uh so let
[2:14:03] me so um he's there and God pronounces a
[2:14:08] curse um upon
[2:14:11] anyone who would not. Now they were
[2:14:13] going to war. Okay. So they were
[2:14:15] commanded to go after Moab and lay waste
[2:14:18] to the
[2:14:19] city. Go after them. I want I want them
[2:14:23] I want them to be rid.
[2:14:27] Moab was a thorn in the side. They were
[2:14:29] prideful. Israel is
[2:14:31] there. The command, go lay waste to
[2:14:34] them. People, livestock, kids, old
[2:14:39] people, city, burn, destroy, maim,
[2:14:42] everything. Go do
[2:14:44] it. And
[2:14:47] so the Israelites are given this
[2:14:49] command, go and do the do the work of
[2:14:52] the Lord. You know, I don't want to get
[2:14:55] to heaven and have a scratched up shield
[2:14:59] and a clean sword.
[2:15:03] We put on the armor of God. Thank God
[2:15:07] for the shield.
[2:15:10] Brother Matt said it so beautifully. You
[2:15:11] know, there's shield, shield, shield. No
[2:15:13] armor behind me. Shield, shield. So
[2:15:14] beautiful. And this triggered my
[2:15:16] thinking. I don't want to get to heaven
[2:15:19] and have a scratched up shield, you
[2:15:21] know.
[2:15:23] And
[2:15:24] no and a a a nich sword, right? A a a
[2:15:29] clean
[2:15:31] sword because that means that I didn't
[2:15:34] do any
[2:15:35] fighting. That means that I was on the
[2:15:38] defensive all the time, but I never
[2:15:41] played the offensive. In other words, I
[2:15:43] never pursued
[2:15:45] my enemy.
[2:15:48] I was defensive all the time.
[2:15:50] And I feel there's a lot of people in
[2:15:52] here where we feel like we're defensive
[2:15:55] all the time. You don't have to live
[2:15:56] like that. You don't have to live like
[2:16:00] that. I don't want to get to heaven and
[2:16:02] have a scratched up shield and a clean
[2:16:04] sword. This is what happened. God
[2:16:07] actually said this in Jeremiah chapter
[2:16:09] 48:10. Cursed be he. Now the command is
[2:16:13] go and lay waste to the city. Kill
[2:16:14] everything. Cursed be he that doeth the
[2:16:17] work of the Lord deceitfully. Now we're
[2:16:22] He that keepeth back his sword from
[2:16:26] blood. So in other words, all Israelites
[2:16:28] go fight, go, go, move, move, move. And
[2:16:31] they're jumping out of the helicopter
[2:16:33] and they're there in the in the place
[2:16:34] and they're in Moab and their commission
[2:16:36] is go lay waste to your enemy. But this
[2:16:38] the the command was cursed be the person
[2:16:43] who does the work of the Lord
[2:16:44] deceitfully. You know what that means?
[2:16:46] It's literally the Hebrew for
[2:16:47] negligence.
[2:16:49] It's not that you didn't think it was
[2:16:50] important. It's that you didn't do it.
[2:16:52] You let it sit. It's
[2:16:55] negligence. Sometimes I think we can be
[2:16:57] so negligent towards things that are
[2:17:00] wrong in our
[2:17:01] life. Now
[2:17:03] remember, I'm not I'm not uh this does
[2:17:06] not mean that I pursue the people with
[2:17:08] purple
[2:17:10] hair. Don't don't misappropriate this
[2:17:13] scripture. I'm not going to go after the
[2:17:15] person with purple hair because they
[2:17:16] need to know Christ.
[2:17:19] This is to what besieges
[2:17:22] me. This is to what Satan is doing in
[2:17:26] me. This is to the havoc that Satan is
[2:17:29] wreaking in my
[2:17:31] mind. This is to the plague that comes
[2:17:35] comes over your thinking and your
[2:17:37] thoughts. This is the
[2:17:39] temptation. This is all those different
[2:17:41] things. And the cur the command is
[2:17:45] cursed be he who holds back his sword
[2:17:47] from blood. So you've got to pick up the
[2:17:49] sword and you've got to go and every
[2:17:51] single one of those Israelites had to
[2:17:52] come back and have a have blood on their
[2:17:55] swords and plop it down in front of the
[2:17:57] commander and say I got blood on my
[2:17:59] sword. If you did not, a curse would be
[2:18:02] put on that
[2:18:04] person. Now think about this scenario.
[2:18:08] say a young man and you've got a sword
[2:18:11] and you you've got, you know, you're an
[2:18:14] Israelite army and you're coming in and
[2:18:16] you come into the city of Moab and
[2:18:18] you're, you know, uh, with your sword,
[2:18:20] you know, uh, and then you come in and
[2:18:22] you, you know, kick open a door and you
[2:18:24] come in and with your sword and there's
[2:18:27] a young mother with a newborn baby and
[2:18:31] she's in the door just inside the door
[2:18:33] with the door shut her I'm paraphrasing
[2:18:37] major here, but there's, you know, maybe
[2:18:39] her husband was defending the house and
[2:18:40] he's already dead. He's dead on the
[2:18:42] floor and she's got her newborn baby and
[2:18:45] she's huddled up in the corner and she's
[2:18:46] at she's in the wall and she's looking
[2:18:48] at you and you you are a young man.
[2:18:50] We've got the
[2:18:51] sword and you look at that. You look at
[2:18:55] that
[2:18:57] scene
[2:18:59] and imagination,
[2:19:02] conscience,
[2:19:04] reasoning,
[2:19:06] memory starts to plague on that young
[2:19:09] man. People in the Old Testament also
[2:19:11] had minds and they also dealt with
[2:19:14] thinking and thoughts. Uh they had they
[2:19:17] had avenues to the spirit realm. So, you
[2:19:19] can't tell me that that young man wasn't
[2:19:20] didn't have memory of his mom, his
[2:19:22] sisters back at home. Um, he had, you
[2:19:26] know, conscience. He's like, I can't I
[2:19:27] can't kill a baby. I can't kill a mom.
[2:19:31] And he's standing there with a sword in
[2:19:33] his hand, clean sword. And he's standing
[2:19:35] there and he's he's looking at her. And
[2:19:37] she's looking at him. She's a Moabitete.
[2:19:39] He's an
[2:19:41] Israelite. And he's he's
[2:19:43] thinking, "I can't kill them."
[2:19:47] and he just, you know, backs out, shuts
[2:19:51] the door, and then runs
[2:19:54] off and goes fight somebody else. Go
[2:19:56] finds a big burly guy to to
[2:19:59] fight because that's that's more
[2:20:01] reasonable. That makes sense. But to
[2:20:03] kill a mother and child, that doesn't
[2:20:05] make
[2:20:06] sense. And so he did the work of the
[2:20:11] Lord negligently.
[2:20:15] When you follow the leading of the Holy
[2:20:16] Spirit, he will lead you places that are
[2:20:19] difficult, uncomfortable sometimes, but
[2:20:23] the word of the Lord is first and
[2:20:26] foremost. Obedience is better than
[2:20:29] sacrifice.
[2:20:31] It takes great sacrifice to obey.
[2:20:35] Sometimes you got to leave friends.
[2:20:38] There's a guy in the church I used to go
[2:20:40] to, one of one of my just all-time good
[2:20:44] friends, really good guy. And when he
[2:20:46] came into the message of the hour, and
[2:20:48] he re God really got a hold of him, he
[2:20:50] cut his friends off cold
[2:20:53] turkey. And I I always I always remark
[2:20:55] that because I don't know if I would
[2:20:57] have had the courage to do the same.
[2:20:58] Maybe that's why the Lord allowed me to
[2:21:00] be raised in the message because he knew
[2:21:01] that I wasn't strong enough to be able
[2:21:03] to do something like that. Praise be to
[2:21:05] God. That's God's mercy, I guess. But
[2:21:07] for him, he he they they you know, they
[2:21:10] smoked u I think they did weed or in and
[2:21:13] um they just they just did weed every
[2:21:14] once in a while. And um uh just weed.
[2:21:18] No, no big deal. Uh but he and and so he
[2:21:22] knew he he had to make a decision. These
[2:21:25] guys are going to get the better of
[2:21:28] me. And he cut them off. Now, he was
[2:21:31] respectful. He actually went back to
[2:21:33] them and said, 'Hey, you know, I'm I'm a
[2:21:34] Christian and I love you guys, but I
[2:21:36] can't I can't hang out with you anymore
[2:21:37] like this. So, if you guys want to go
[2:21:39] for coffee, you want to go for lunch? He
[2:21:40] actually did that. If you guys want to
[2:21:41] go for coffee or lunch, I'll be happy to
[2:21:43] do that, but I I can't hang out with you
[2:21:44] like that because I it's going to get
[2:21:46] the better of me. And there's there's
[2:21:47] now something on the inside of me. Such
[2:21:50] a testimony. And that guy is a strong
[2:21:53] Christian, beautiful family to this day.
[2:21:56] We can we can have things in our life in
[2:21:59] our hidden
[2:22:01] lives and do the work of the Lord
[2:22:04] negligently.
[2:22:06] You don't want to be
[2:22:09] somebody who has a clean sword and a
[2:22:13] scratched up shield.
[2:22:17] Take your sword, which is to kill, which
[2:22:21] is to
[2:22:22] destroy, and seek out the enemy, and
[2:22:26] kill
[2:22:27] it. Don't mess around with it. Don't do
[2:22:30] it
[2:22:32] negligently. Destroy
[2:22:34] it.
[2:22:37] Go hard after
[2:22:39] it. Pursue the enemy and say, "No, no,
[2:22:42] no. This will not I'm not saying go and
[2:22:44] stir up hell. I'm saying what is
[2:22:46] besieging you? Go after it and use your
[2:22:57] sword. Make it
[2:22:59] dead. The enemy has no power. There is
[2:23:02] no life in the
[2:23:06] enemy.
[2:23:08] Live. Why then let the enemy sit
[2:23:12] there? You figure out what it means. I
[2:23:15] don't have enough time. We don't have
[2:23:16] enough time to talk about all the
[2:23:18] literature and things like this. You as
[2:23:19] an adult, as a mature Christian, figure
[2:23:21] out what it means to lay waste to your
[2:23:24] enemy. You go before the Lord. I can't
[2:23:27] do that. Brother Ron can't live with you
[2:23:29] every day. Brother Matt can't. I can't.
[2:23:31] We can't live with you every day. You've
[2:23:33] got to fight your own battles. So, you
[2:23:35] figure out what it means to have a dead
[2:23:38] enemy at your feet and a bloody sword.
[2:23:40] You go before the Lord with fear and
[2:23:42] trembling and say, "Lord, what does it
[2:23:44] mean for me to be an overcomer? Be an
[2:23:47] overcomer through me, Lord. May I pick
[2:23:50] up my sword. I've got it in my hand. May
[2:23:53] I, by the power of the Holy Spirit, get
[2:23:55] this thing out of my life. It will come
[2:23:58] back and plague me. It will come back
[2:24:00] and plague me." A Holy Ghostfilled
[2:24:01] believer cannot be possessed of a demon.
[2:24:04] They are oppressed of the enemy. They
[2:24:06] are flying around seeking whom they may
[2:24:09] devour. They are always going to be
[2:24:11] coming after you. Jesus himself standing
[2:24:12] there saying it is not what goes into a
[2:24:15] man that defiles him. It is what he acts
[2:24:17] on.
[2:24:20] You go before the Lord. You figure out
[2:24:22] what that means to say, Lord, I want to
[2:24:24] walk as an overcomer because Monday is
[2:24:27] coming. Brother Matt preach a sermon
[2:24:28] like that. Tuesday is coming. Wednesday
[2:24:30] is coming. I feel great on Sunday
[2:24:32] morning at camp, but I got to go home
[2:24:34] and I got to live an everyday life. The
[2:24:37] maniac of Gdara was delivered of Legion.
[2:24:41] And he comes up to Jesus and says, "I
[2:24:43] want to follow you. Let me be your
[2:24:44] disciple." And Jesus says, "No, man. No.
[2:24:48] I want you to go home and I want you to
[2:24:51] live a normal life and I want you to
[2:24:53] proclaim what happened to you." Here,
[2:24:57] this man is saying, "I want to follow
[2:24:58] you. Let me get on the ship and let's
[2:24:59] go." And Jesus literally says, "Nope.
[2:25:01] Turn around. Go back home. Live a normal
[2:25:03] life." Can you imagine what that guy had
[2:25:05] to deal with at the grocery store the
[2:25:06] next week? He's standing there at the
[2:25:09] grocery store. You
[2:25:11] know, I I I I am redeemed. Bye, love,
[2:25:15] divine. You know, he's just he's happy.
[2:25:17] He's at the grocery store getting
[2:25:18] groceries for his family. And then these
[2:25:20] people are standing behind him and
[2:25:21] they're
[2:25:23] like, "That's the
[2:25:27] guy. That's the guy. He was just running
[2:25:29] naked through the graveyards last week.
[2:25:33] That's the crazy dude. And you're taking
[2:25:36] their kids and hiding them. You
[2:25:38] know, you
[2:25:40] know, and he has to deal with that kind
[2:25:44] of
[2:25:44] behavior. He had to learn these people
[2:25:47] look at me like I am a unclean thing
[2:25:51] when I am not unclean anymore. He had to
[2:25:53] go back and live a normal life as a as a
[2:25:56] um you know a person just changed and he
[2:26:00] had to stand in line. Everybody looking
[2:26:02] around at him saying that's the but what
[2:26:05] a testimony he had. You sisters I think
[2:26:08] of sister Sarah. It almost makes me cry
[2:26:11] when sister I see the picture of sister
[2:26:12] Sarah up there in the skirt and the
[2:26:14] sherpa asking you know um she wears
[2:26:17] skirts all the time and I said yeah and
[2:26:18] she said he's he's the first one I've
[2:26:19] seen you can go amazing places. Now,
[2:26:22] here's what I want to end
[2:26:23] with. We got to lay waste to the
[2:26:28] enemy. But I want to I want to live
[2:26:32] life.
[2:26:35] Anybody want to live life? This This is
[2:26:38] not my home. Don't misunderstand me. I
[2:26:41] This is not my home. I am homesick here.
[2:26:44] I don't want to be here. I look for his
[2:26:47] appearing. That is my hope. That is my
[2:26:50] direction. But
[2:26:54] the there yet. So my hope is to the
[2:26:58] Lord. Ba land. I'm longing for I I am.
[2:27:03] But he has me right here right now. He
[2:27:06] has me in Arizona
[2:27:09] in June 1st. Thank you. 2025. He has you
[2:27:13] sitting right
[2:27:14] here. He doesn't have you up there yet.
[2:27:17] You're here. So, while you're here,
[2:27:20] don't you want to live life? Amen.
[2:27:24] I think following receiving the baptism
[2:27:28] of the Holy
[2:27:30] Spirit and and pursuing the leading of
[2:27:34] the Holy Spirit in your life will be the
[2:27:37] greatest adventure you will ever have.
[2:27:42] He will lead you to places you never
[2:27:45] thought you'd go.
[2:27:48] He will lead you and he's given you
[2:27:50] gifts and talents, but he will lead you
[2:27:52] to do things that you never thought you
[2:27:55] would do. Here's a, you know,
[2:27:57] long-haired hippie boy
[2:28:00] surfing in California, you know, and
[2:28:03] he's there and he's, uh, you know,
[2:28:06] surfing and he sees this beautiful girl
[2:28:09] and, you know, they get married and he's
[2:28:11] there and then,
[2:28:13] um, you
[2:28:15] know, and then he finds the
[2:28:18] Lord. The message of the hour changes
[2:28:21] him. and his life is set on a different
[2:28:25] course. And now here he sits here.
[2:28:28] Brother Ron
[2:28:30] Peterson, you think of all your
[2:28:32] different stories, all the different
[2:28:33] places that God has taken you. Brother
[2:28:36] Matt was telling some of his testimony.
[2:28:38] Incredible. Um, you think of your story.
[2:28:43] Don't try to live somebody else's story.
[2:28:45] Live yours.
[2:28:47] You know, I went I went through this
[2:28:49] whole thing of um
[2:28:53] uh I I don't I don't like to take so
[2:28:56] much time talking about myself, but I I
[2:28:58] I feel like I I just I feel like I need
[2:29:00] to share this with you. Um I
[2:29:03] uh I I you know, I always thought
[2:29:06] mountains were really really cool and uh
[2:29:08] always wanted to climb one. when I was a
[2:29:10] little kid and it would snow, I'd string
[2:29:11] up, you know, a rope and then I'd have
[2:29:13] like I'd dress up in all the gear and
[2:29:15] try to mimic the people I saw on Everest
[2:29:18] and all these different things. And I,
[2:29:19] you know, all my life, uh, I thought,
[2:29:20] "Oh, man. I, you know, I can't I can't.
[2:29:22] That's for pro athletes. Like, ain't no
[2:29:24] way." And, um, then one day I started
[2:29:28] to, you know, exercise because I
[2:29:30] realized I don't want to be 50 years old
[2:29:32] and look back and think, man, I wished I
[2:29:35] had exercised and really taken care of
[2:29:37] the body that God gave me. So, I started
[2:29:40] to eat healthier. Um, uh, In and Out is
[2:29:44] a subcategory that doesn't it doesn't it
[2:29:47] doesn't it's not the same. It's not
[2:29:49] same. So, it doesn't that's not a it's
[2:29:51] not there's nothing. Don't worry about
[2:29:52] that. But, I I wanted to eat healthier
[2:29:55] and I wanted to to exercise. And then I
[2:29:57] got so bored. I said, "This is
[2:30:00] horrible." So, I was like, "I need
[2:30:01] something to work out for." And so I
[2:30:03] again I'm just I I want to be 60 and uh
[2:30:06] you know if I get an a disease that you
[2:30:09] know is is
[2:30:10] uncontrollable the Lord's will be done.
[2:30:13] Um but I'm I don't want
[2:30:15] to be sick all the time because I'm
[2:30:18] eating trash. That that's that's on me.
[2:30:22] So I'm going to I want to be able to run
[2:30:23] around with my grandkids and take them
[2:30:25] on whatever you know mountains. So I I
[2:30:28] um I got really bored and then I I went
[2:30:30] through this whole thing
[2:30:32] of I want to climb a mountain. I saw
[2:30:35] something, you know, I was reading uh
[2:30:36] something and I want to I want to climb
[2:30:38] a mountain. And so I I went and I looked
[2:30:42] and I I I you know asked I talked to
[2:30:45] Sister Sarah about it, made sure she was
[2:30:47] okay with it and um we we talked about
[2:30:49] it. I did some major selling and I did
[2:30:52] really good job but she you know she
[2:30:55] was okay. So I was like, "Yes." So we I
[2:30:58] I signed up for it. And the whole time
[2:31:01] that I signed up for this mountain, it's
[2:31:02] Mount Baker if any of you have seen
[2:31:04] Mount Baker. Beautiful place. And um
[2:31:06] bunny slope of a mountain to climb, but
[2:31:08] it's beautiful place. And uh so I was
[2:31:10] like, there ain't no way I'm going to
[2:31:11] make it up. Ain't no way. And then I
[2:31:14] went through this whole thing
[2:31:16] of I'm a pastor now. Like, you know, I I
[2:31:21] shouldn't be I shouldn't be doing that.
[2:31:22] I shouldn't be doing that. And then I
[2:31:24] was thinking, you know, like uh it's
[2:31:27] dangerous, you know, there's got to be
[2:31:29] some element of danger to it. And I I
[2:31:31] you know, like I shouldn't I shouldn't
[2:31:33] be doing that. I shouldn't be doing
[2:31:34] that. And I I'd mention it to a few
[2:31:35] people and they'd be like, "Why are you
[2:31:37] doing that?" You know, um you know,
[2:31:39] things like that. Uh and I I went
[2:31:41] through this whole inner turmoil where I
[2:31:43] was thinking, "Yeah, I shouldn't do
[2:31:45] that. I should just cancel. I I you
[2:31:46] know, I shouldn't I shouldn't be on
[2:31:47] mountains. I'm a pastor. I shouldn't be
[2:31:49] doing that." And then it I had a just a
[2:31:51] real experience and I was uh I was
[2:31:53] praying one morning and um uh I read the
[2:31:58] scripture say to this mountain or speak
[2:32:00] to the mountain and
[2:32:03] uh I realized hang on a
[2:32:06] second if I can if I can get up in the
[2:32:09] morning for the glory of God and I can
[2:32:12] go to my work or whatever it is or get
[2:32:14] up and preach that that gift that God
[2:32:16] has given in me. I I live my life for
[2:32:19] the gospel of Jesus Christ. I don't know
[2:32:20] about you, but I do. There's no question
[2:32:22] about that. I live for the gospel. And I
[2:32:25] thought, if I can do that for the glory
[2:32:26] of God, then I can climb up to the top
[2:32:29] of that mountain for the glory of
[2:32:31] God. I said, I I can absolutely do that
[2:32:35] because if I'm a believer, I can be a
[2:32:37] believer here, there, here, there, and
[2:32:39] on the top of that mountain. And if God
[2:32:41] has made me um who I am in him, I I want
[2:32:45] to pursue life. I want to live wherever
[2:32:48] God would lead me, whatever have he
[2:32:49] would have me to do. And he made a way
[2:32:51] for me to for that to be something that
[2:32:53] was on the radar and something that I
[2:32:54] had to figure out and discern. And it
[2:32:56] was something that I thought, well, I
[2:32:57] should go and do it. And then I had to
[2:32:59] go through this whole turmoil and you
[2:33:01] know, I can't I shouldn't be doing that.
[2:33:03] There are a hundred reasons as to why I
[2:33:05] should not why you should not be on a
[2:33:06] mountain. Nobody needs to be up there.
[2:33:09] It is com. It is foolish. Nobody needs
[2:33:11] to be on the top of a mountain. There's
[2:33:13] nothing up there but wind and ice and
[2:33:15] rock. Ain't nobody need to be up on top
[2:33:18] of a mountain. It is foolishness. So I
[2:33:21] had to go through all of this and think
[2:33:22] I can't do that. I I committed to it. I
[2:33:25] said, Lord, if if I can if I can stand
[2:33:27] here for the gospel of Jesus Christ, I
[2:33:29] can climb that mountain for the gospel
[2:33:31] of Jesus Christ. I could I could be a
[2:33:32] believer there. So, I'm going to do it.
[2:33:35] And I I began to work out. I began to
[2:33:36] train. I did not think I was going to be
[2:33:38] able to make it. I started to get up
[2:33:40] there and uh I started to and I I just I
[2:33:42] want to finish with this. I was going to
[2:33:44] talk about
[2:33:46] um other other people, but I I
[2:33:50] um it's not working. I I
[2:33:53] I started on the climb and um we're
[2:33:58] we're on the way up and I start putting
[2:34:01] my I start putting one foot in front of
[2:34:04] the other. I had this really heavy pack
[2:34:07] and I start putting one foot in front of
[2:34:08] the other. This is Everest. This is not
[2:34:10] me. This is not Mount Baker. Just FYI.
[2:34:12] Um, this is somebody else, but I I know
[2:34:14] that guy um who's there in the back. Uh,
[2:34:16] he's a a good friend of mine. He's a
[2:34:18] sherpa Nepalese guy. And I I So, I have
[2:34:21] my pack on and I'm climbing and I'm
[2:34:24] realizing this is really really hard.
[2:34:28] And what it does, and Mount Baker's
[2:34:30] 11,000 ft. When you get past I think
[2:34:32] we're at um
[2:34:36] uh 67. We're at 6,700 feet. So, 6,700
[2:34:41] feet. When you get past 12,000, you
[2:34:43] really start oxygen really starts to
[2:34:44] mess with you. Messes with everybody
[2:34:46] differently. Messes with me really bad.
[2:34:48] And I think the Lord put I think the
[2:34:49] Lord made my physiology not to do well
[2:34:51] at altitude to keep me down here, but
[2:34:53] he's he's allowed me to climb some
[2:34:54] mountains, but I don't do well at
[2:34:56] altitude. You can be the fittest person
[2:34:57] on earth and just not do well. It's your
[2:34:58] physiology. So, I'm there and we're, you
[2:35:01] know, um you're approaching uh you know,
[2:35:03] 10,000 feet. And I'm, you know, I'm
[2:35:05] like, and what happens is is you put one
[2:35:10] foot in front of the other. And
[2:35:12] especially on higher altitudes, not on
[2:35:14] Mount Baker, but you know, when you get
[2:35:15] up towards Everest or or other
[2:35:17] mountains, and you know, when you get up
[2:35:18] towards 19,000 ft like I was just
[2:35:20] talking about, you're you're like you
[2:35:22] don't you're not thinking straight and
[2:35:24] you feel like you're dying because you
[2:35:26] are. Your body is just you're fine, but
[2:35:28] your body is telling you there's
[2:35:30] something wrong. Go back down. There's
[2:35:31] not enough oxygen. So you're
[2:35:32] acclimatizing. So you're you're fine,
[2:35:35] but you feel mentally like I'm I'm a I'm
[2:35:37] a wreck. I'm a wreck. I'm a wreck. And
[2:35:39] so you feel like I I I can't do this. I
[2:35:41] can't do this. So every step you are you
[2:35:44] literally feel your body itself, your
[2:35:46] physiology is screaming out to you, you
[2:35:48] got to go down. You can't do this. You
[2:35:50] can't do this. What you do is you put
[2:35:51] one foot in front of the
[2:35:53] other. You put one foot in front of the
[2:35:56] other. Such spiritual application. You
[2:35:59] put one foot in front of the other.
[2:36:03] put one foot in front of the
[2:36:05] other and one step after the other, you
[2:36:11] find yourself a few steps away from the
[2:36:14] summit. Now, I've been on a lot of
[2:36:16] adventures, but I have never felt
[2:36:17] something as as awesome um you know,
[2:36:19] just in natural and everyday adventuring
[2:36:21] and stuff like that. I've never felt
[2:36:22] anything as awesome as being 10 feet
[2:36:24] from the summit and you know you're
[2:36:27] going to make it. You know, you're like
[2:36:28] you're like 50 yards from the summit and
[2:36:30] you know you're going to make it. You're
[2:36:31] depleted. You feel bad, but you know
[2:36:32] you're going to make it. And at that
[2:36:34] altitude, you're emotional. So, you turn
[2:36:37] into this crybaby. So, you're
[2:36:44] like and you're literally so emotional
[2:36:47] and you you feel like I've achieved it.
[2:36:50] And you're It's really funny. And I So,
[2:36:53] I cry at every summit. I'm just
[2:36:56] like And it's it's 11,000 ft. It's not
[2:36:59] really and it's really funny. But so I'm
[2:37:01] I'm I'm just like you're you're you're
[2:37:03] you know 50 feet from the summit and
[2:37:05] you're
[2:37:08] just I I'm going to do it. Yes. And
[2:37:11] there's just no feeling like it. But you
[2:37:13] know the amazing thing about mountain
[2:37:15] climbing is that the summit is only
[2:37:19] halfway because the summit is optional.
[2:37:22] Um Ed Vers well-known climber said that
[2:37:25] the summit is optional. The camp is
[2:37:28] mandatory. You got to go. If you go up,
[2:37:30] you got to get back to camp. You don't
[2:37:32] want to die. Now, I don't do anything
[2:37:34] dangerous, majorly dangerous. What I do
[2:37:37] is you there is actually the equivalent
[2:37:39] amount of danger of you going to the
[2:37:41] grocery store in a hunk of metal at 70
[2:37:43] miles an hour than there is in what I
[2:37:45] do. So, it's, you know, just equal
[2:37:48] amount of danger. So, it's not really
[2:37:50] dangerous. But when I when I'm when
[2:37:52] you're there, um, you have to make it
[2:37:55] back down to camp. So when you get up to
[2:37:58] the summit and you're you have that
[2:38:00] feeling and you're only there for a few
[2:38:02] minutes because you're delirious and you
[2:38:03] you going back down. 84% of people who
[2:38:06] die on Everest die on the way down
[2:38:08] because they're depleted. They're
[2:38:10] they're wasted and they get delirious
[2:38:13] and they literally
[2:38:15] just and they're gone. So, um I just
[2:38:19] said it's not dangerous and then I'm
[2:38:20] just uh close your ears, honey. But I
[2:38:24] and so you have to go up to the summit,
[2:38:26] but you have to go down. And this is one
[2:38:28] thing that I have learned in in in my
[2:38:30] life, and I think you you who are older
[2:38:32] in the back, you can say the same thing.
[2:38:34] I just want to leave you with
[2:38:35] this.
[2:38:38] Um,
[2:38:40] life with the Holy Spirit is an
[2:38:45] adventure and you will be tempted your
[2:38:48] entire
[2:38:49] life. You will be tempted your entire
[2:38:52] life.
[2:38:54] Um, a lustful spirit takes advantage of
[2:38:57] how of the physiology that God made you
[2:39:00] with. God made you a red-blooded male,
[2:39:02] red-blooded female. Satan takes
[2:39:04] advantage of that. He tries to pervert
[2:39:07] that through pornography, whatever it
[2:39:09] would be. Satan's primary purpose is to
[2:39:13] sit in the seat as if he is
[2:39:15] God. And so, he messes with you. That's
[2:39:17] all he's got to do. Like I said
[2:39:19] yesterday, demons don't go to the
[2:39:22] beach. Their objective is to destroy
[2:39:25] that which has life. So, the possession
[2:39:28] of the land is not one of of peaches and
[2:39:30] cream. It's of fighting. It's of bloody
[2:39:33] swords.
[2:39:37] life is is a journey because God put you
[2:39:41] here. You're not there yet. He puts you
[2:39:44] here. So while you are
[2:39:47] here, my encouragement to you and I
[2:39:50] think what the services have been trying
[2:39:51] to say, brother Matt so beautifully,
[2:39:53] what I'm what I think you need to
[2:39:54] understand is that you can have the Holy
[2:39:58] Ghost. It's the Holy Ghost a gift to
[2:40:02] you. It's not complicated. You receive
[2:40:04] that gift into your
[2:40:06] life. And when you have that, emotions
[2:40:09] come and things like that, but then by
[2:40:11] the power of the Holy Spirit, you can be
[2:40:13] delivered of things. But Satan comes
[2:40:16] right back and tries to tempt you again.
[2:40:20] He comes right back and he tries to
[2:40:22] affect you. He tries to
[2:40:25] um mess with your thinking.
[2:40:28] He tries to give you anxiety and
[2:40:30] depression and keep you
[2:40:33] there. And the picture of a mature
[2:40:36] Christian, milk to meat, child to adult,
[2:40:41] is this one who can correctly divide the
[2:40:45] word of truth and then apply it in their
[2:40:48] thinking, apply it in their lives and
[2:40:51] let the Holy Spirit live through them
[2:40:54] and bring their thoughts subject to the
[2:40:56] obedience of Christ.
[2:40:58] It's Bible 101. It is not
[2:41:02] psychology. Paul says as a Holy
[2:41:05] Ghostfilled
[2:41:07] believer, you have to get under your
[2:41:09] body. He actually uses long-distance
[2:41:11] running as the analogy, run the
[2:41:15] race. You will make mistakes. I had
[2:41:17] several quotes where brother Random says
[2:41:18] you will make mistakes when
[2:41:22] you total of your mistakes and the sum
[2:41:25] total of your successes that win out.
[2:41:27] That is
[2:41:29] Islam. That is Buddhism. That is
[2:41:32] Hinduism. That is not the person of the
[2:41:34] Lord Jesus
[2:41:36] Christ. What it is is a life
[2:41:42] lived. Climb the mountain.
[2:41:45] Go, go do what God wants you to be. Be
[2:41:48] the best nurse that you can possibly be.
[2:41:52] Don't be apathetic in what you do.
[2:41:54] Pursue where the God where God of heaven
[2:41:56] and earth would lead you to be. If God
[2:41:58] calls you, some of you to be a deacon,
[2:42:00] he calls some of you to be a minister,
[2:42:02] some of you to be a song leader, some of
[2:42:04] you to be electricians, some of you to
[2:42:06] be software engineers, some of you to be
[2:42:10] what you possibly can at it. You will
[2:42:13] have difficulties. You will have trials,
[2:42:15] but God did not call you just to slump
[2:42:18] back in fear and have a scratched up
[2:42:19] shield. That is not a believer. A
[2:42:21] believer lays waste to the enemy and
[2:42:23] then walks forward in faith. It is it is
[2:42:27] hard sometimes because you got to put
[2:42:29] one foot in front of the
[2:42:31] other and one foot in front of the
[2:42:35] other and put your crampon in the ice.
[2:42:39] Slam your ice axe down. One foot in
[2:42:41] front of the other.
[2:42:43] cramp on down ice axe and you keep
[2:42:46] moving and you keep moving and you keep
[2:42:49] moving and you keep pressing forward
[2:42:51] until the end. Paul said this this
[2:42:57] term forgetting those things which are
[2:42:59] behind me does not mean that you delete
[2:43:01] memories because you can't memories are
[2:43:04] the mileionation of gal cells in your
[2:43:06] brain. It's an electrical impulse. You
[2:43:08] can't just delete it, right? You have
[2:43:11] those memories. You you had maybe some
[2:43:13] really bad mistakes in the past. He
[2:43:16] says, I forgetting forgetting those
[2:43:18] things which are behind. You know what
[2:43:19] that in the in the Greek what it's
[2:43:22] saying is I will not let the past define
[2:43:25] this
[2:43:27] moment. So I
[2:43:30] will forgetting those things which are
[2:43:33] behind me move forward.
[2:43:38] I'm going to move forward. You got
[2:43:40] difficulties. You got trials. Great.
[2:43:42] You'll learn from them. You're going to
[2:43:43] grow. Praise the Lord. You got
[2:43:46] difficulties. You got decisions,
[2:43:47] questions, great. You'll get an answer
[2:43:49] because the Lord is gracious. He will
[2:43:50] answer your question. Sometimes you got
[2:43:52] to wait. But he will answer your
[2:43:53] question. A mature Christian presses
[2:43:57] towards the mark of the high calling of
[2:43:58] Christ. It is not easy. I'll be the
[2:44:00] first to admit, brother Matt said it
[2:44:02] last night. I make mistakes all the
[2:44:04] time. And by the grace and the mercy of
[2:44:08] God, I can say, "Greater is he that's
[2:44:10] within me than he that's within the
[2:44:11] world. I can do all things through
[2:44:13] Christ who strengthens me." And I keep
[2:44:15] moving forward. You, Satan, will pull
[2:44:17] you off. You just move right back
[2:44:19] forward. He'll pull you off. He'll move
[2:44:21] you forward. Isaiah said it like this.
[2:44:23] You'll hear a voice behind you telling
[2:44:26] you where you should go. Listen to the
[2:44:28] voice of God.
[2:44:31] It's not just
[2:44:34] um slumping back in fear and fighting
[2:44:36] the enemy all the
[2:44:38] time. It's laying waste to the enemy and
[2:44:42] then moving forward in a fearless,
[2:44:45] strong, certain life in the Holy Ghost.
[2:44:50] If you if you if you haven't received
[2:44:52] the baptism of the Holy Spirit, you can
[2:44:54] you can receive it right now. If you
[2:44:57] have, go forward in faith.
[2:45:01] Don't let the enemy turn you to and fro.
[2:45:03] If you've got something that you need to
[2:45:05] deal with, seek deliverance. Get it
[2:45:06] rooted out. Deal with it and move on
[2:45:10] strong and
[2:45:12] sure. I forget those things which are
[2:45:14] behind me and I press towards the mark
[2:45:16] of the high calling of Christ. You can
[2:45:18] do great things in Christ. You can uh
[2:45:21] sometimes he'll take you to the top of a
[2:45:22] mountain. You never know where the Lord
[2:45:24] will take you. I remember standing there
[2:45:26] on the summit and looking down over I've
[2:45:28] always wanted to look at cumulus clouds
[2:45:30] and I was looking down at those clouds
[2:45:32] like looking out of an airplane. The
[2:45:34] winds
[2:45:35] just and it's just you know biting cold
[2:45:38] and it's just and you're looking there
[2:45:40] and I was thinking on that summit
[2:45:41] emotional as I was crying I was I was
[2:45:44] thinking I I it just it just struck me I
[2:45:49] can do all things through Christ who
[2:45:50] strengthens
[2:45:52] me.
[2:45:59] Would you bow your heads with
[2:46:11] me? I want to pray with
[2:46:14] you. I believe that you are I believe
[2:46:17] that you are strong people.
[2:46:23] But you know sometimes the Lord will
[2:46:25] bring us to a place of we we will get to
[2:46:28] a place of weakness and the Lord will
[2:46:30] let you realize then and there ah it's
[2:46:34] not my strength that is carrying me
[2:46:36] forward it is nothing but the Lord Jesus
[2:46:40] Christ you know he is so merciful and
[2:46:42] gracious to
[2:46:44] us when people get to do peopleling
[2:46:47] things he is so merciful and you know no
[2:46:51] dou out in your lives. You'll make
[2:46:53] mistakes. Things will happen. Weird
[2:46:55] things will happen. He'll lead you to
[2:46:57] adventures. He led Paul preach Philip
[2:47:00] preach in a a meeting. Gets up, goes out
[2:47:04] into the middle of the desert somewhere.
[2:47:07] Why on earth would he do that? And he
[2:47:09] leads a soul to Christ right there.
[2:47:11] That's an
[2:47:13] adventure. He'll lead you to do amazing
[2:47:16] things.
[2:47:18] pursue the leading of the Holy
[2:47:22] Spirit. Brother Brandham would say it
[2:47:24] best. Down with Satan and his gloom and
[2:47:28] up with the faith of the Lord Jesus
[2:47:31] Christ. I encourage you
[2:47:33] [Music]
[2:47:35] all
[2:47:37] pursue leading of the Holy
[2:47:40] Spirit. Live your
[2:47:42] adventure. He is good. He is merciful.
[2:47:46] He is gracious.
[2:47:48] He is mighty in
[2:47:51] you. Don't shrink back at the enemy. You
[2:47:55] can hold your head high. Say, "Greater
[2:47:57] is he that's within me."
[2:48:01] lay waste to the
[2:48:02] enemy. You'll walk through heaven's
[2:48:04] gates with a scratched up shield. Throw
[2:48:07] your sword down and say, "Here is the
[2:48:10] blood of my enemies."
[2:48:13] Heavenly
[2:48:14] Father, Lord, what a wonderful camp
[2:48:16] you've given
[2:48:18] us, we got to go
[2:48:25] back. Can't
[2:48:27] lose. It just happens. We feel really
[2:48:30] down after being with friends, being in
[2:48:32] the presence of the Lord. We got to go
[2:48:33] back to our situations.
[2:48:35] So Lord, I pray
[2:48:40] for and you are so helpful in those
[2:48:43] times. But
[2:48:45] Lord, may we go back
[2:48:49] home with
[2:48:51] assurance of where we stand in the
[2:48:53] person of the Lord Jesus
[2:48:55] Christ. May we go back home not saying,
[2:48:58] "Boy, I really hope I don't make another
[2:49:00] mistake." May we go back home and say,
[2:49:03] "Satan, I am not unaware of your
[2:49:07] devices. I'm living as a son and
[2:49:09] daughter of God, head held
[2:49:12] high. If I make a mistake, I'll get
[2:49:15] right back up. And I'm going to keep
[2:49:17] going and keep going until the Lord
[2:49:20] calls me
[2:49:22] home." May that be your prayer. I pray
[2:49:26] for each one of you.
[2:49:28] I pray God's blessing upon you, but I
[2:49:31] pray that he would keep
[2:49:34] you. Each one of you young people, you
[2:49:36] adults that are in the
[2:49:38] room, Lord, we bind our faith together.
[2:49:41] We pray for one
[2:49:43] another that you would be mighty through
[2:49:47] us that the enemy would no
[2:49:49] longer be able to just do whatever he
[2:49:52] pleases in our in our in our in who in
[2:49:55] our thinking. May we stand
[2:49:58] strong. May we put one foot in front of
[2:50:00] the other,
[2:50:03] steady,
[2:50:05] strong. May we not let those things
[2:50:07] which were behind us define how we live
[2:50:10] in this moment. May we, Lord, I pray
[2:50:14] that you would give us the courage, the
[2:50:16] willingness, but the courage and the
[2:50:19] strength to press towards the
[2:50:22] mark, the high calling of Christ.
[2:50:26] I want to live for the Lord Jesus
[2:50:31] Christ. Where you have me, I want to
[2:50:33] live to the
[2:50:35] [Music]
[2:50:38] fullest. I pray for all of these young
[2:50:41] people, every single person in this
[2:50:43] room, as we go
[2:50:46] home, may we hold the banner
[2:50:49] high, knowing that our victory is not in
[2:50:52] ourselves.
[2:50:53] It is in the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:50:59] Christ. Lord, would you deal with each
[2:51:02] each
[2:51:02] individual? May they take the lick of
[2:51:06] fire, go back to where you would have
[2:51:08] them and stand
[2:51:14] strong. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:51:16] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[2:51:21] Jesus
[2:51:23] name we press
[2:51:27] on. Let's stand and sing this now.

[2:52:03] eyes we find the
[2:52:08] strength to press
[2:52:11] on. Let's sing it again now in Jesus
[2:52:14] name.
[2:52:16] [Music]
[2:52:17] [Applause]
[2:52:18] Thank

[2:52:27] that you just want to press on? Then

[2:52:46] Dear
[2:52:48] Lord, with the
[2:52:53] Christ clear

[2:53:00] eyes. Oh, we

[2:53:07] strength to pre.
[2:53:12] [Music]
[2:53:14] Amen. Amen.
[2:53:16] Um, if you want prayer, I'd be happy to
[2:53:19] pray with you. We can we can pray with
[2:53:21] you. Uh, be happy to do that with you.
[2:53:25] Um, but I want to sing that song.
[2:53:30] Um, and I can't remember the one that we
[2:53:32] the one that I sang
[2:53:33] yesterday. Um, all the way. Can we sing
[2:53:37] that? I uh I pray that the Lord blesses
[2:53:40] you and uh I want to go all the way. I
[2:53:44] want you to make it. How many of you
[2:53:46] believe you're going to make it? Praise
[2:53:48] the Lord. I want to see you on the other
[2:53:51] side. Let's sing this. Oh, all the
[2:53:57] way. Going all the
[2:54:00] way. All the way.
[2:54:06] It all
[2:54:08] away. All the
[2:54:11] way. I'm going all the
[2:54:16] way. Going all the way with my
[2:54:24] Lord. All the
[2:54:27] way. I'm going all the
[2:54:31] way. All the way.
[2:54:35] I'm going all the
[2:54:39] way. All the
[2:54:42] way. I'm going all the
[2:54:46] way. I'm going all the way with my
[2:54:52] Lord. Next verse. Made my
[2:54:57] choice. I'm going all the way.
[2:55:02] I've made my
[2:55:05] choice. I'm going all the
[2:55:09] way. I've made my
[2:55:12] choice. I'm going all the
[2:55:16] way. I'm going all the way with my Lord.
[2:55:23] You've made a decision. Let's sing it
[2:55:26] together. Let's raise our hands and
[2:55:28] worship the Lord. Hallelujah all the
[2:55:30] way. Oh, I made my
[2:55:35] decision. I'm going all the
[2:55:39] way. I made my
[2:55:42] decision. I'm going all the way. Yes,
[2:55:47] I'm going all the way. Just one more
[2:55:51] time. I made my
[2:55:54] decision. I made my
[2:55:57] decision. I'm going all the way.
[2:56:02] I made my
[2:56:05] decision. I'm going all the
[2:56:08] way. I made my
[2:56:12] decision. I'm going all the way. Yes,
[2:56:17] I'm going all the way with my
[2:56:23] Lord. Hallelujah. Somebody give the Lord
[2:56:26] a hand clap of praise.
[2:56:29] [Music]
[2:56:31] Oh yes sir. May it be more than a song.
[2:56:36] May it be more than words, but may it be
[2:56:39] a revelation. May it be a a conviction
[2:56:43] from your heart that you're saying,
[2:56:45] "I've made a choice. I I've made a
[2:56:48] decision. I'm I'm going all the way.
[2:56:50] I've started my
[2:56:52] journey. The journey is is not easy. The
[2:56:56] journey is tough. How am I going to make
[2:56:59] it all the way, brother Steven? One step
[2:57:02] at a
[2:57:03] time. That's too simple. But God is
[2:57:07] known in
[2:57:09] simplicity. If you're to take all of the
[2:57:13] services, there's a there's a there's a
[2:57:15] vein that has started from the very
[2:57:18] first service to this service. and and
[2:57:21] and once uh you once you start digging
[2:57:24] for gold, you you you follow the vein.
[2:57:28] And so, Brother Matt, he started off, he
[2:57:30] started talking about digging
[2:57:32] ditches. And there was from that sermon,
[2:57:35] there was a vein of gold that started to
[2:57:37] run through these services, and it was
[2:57:39] this. You're going to make
[2:57:41] mistakes. You're going to go through
[2:57:43] trials and temptations and issues of
[2:57:46] life. And some things aren't going to be
[2:57:49] easy. And guess what? That's
[2:57:52] okay. Don't let your failures define who
[2:57:56] you are. Don't have a mindset of a
[2:58:00] servant, but as a son of
[2:58:02] God, have the mindset of if I get
[2:58:05] knocked down 10 times, I'm going to get
[2:58:08] up the 11th
[2:58:10] time. Because winners never quit and
[2:58:14] quitters never win. So saints of God,
[2:58:18] hold the simplicity of God in your heart
[2:58:21] and say, "Today I'm going to take a step
[2:58:24] and I'm going to breathe and tomorrow
[2:58:26] I'm going to take a step and I'm going
[2:58:28] to breathe and I'm going to take a step
[2:58:30] and I'm going to breathe and I'm going
[2:58:32] to continue this decision that I've made
[2:58:35] with God until he takes me home through
