[21:44] getting killed got um kind of messed me
[21:47] up more than I thought it would or more
[21:49] than I'd care to admit. um because I
[21:51] really enjoyed um listening to his what
[21:54] he would say and I think more so just
[21:56] the example and the character um of his
[21:59] life. And so
[22:03] thinking through all that um the song
[22:06] came on my heart um we can put our trust
[22:10] in a lot of different things but at the
[22:12] end of the day there's only one thing
[22:13] that's not going to fail.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um so I wanted to sing this
[22:18] just again because it came on my heart
[22:21] and it seemed real appropriate.
[22:25] On Christ the solid
[22:29] rock I stand.
[22:32] All other ground
[22:34] is sinking sand.
[22:38] All other ground is sinking sand.

[22:52] My hope is built on nothing less
[22:57] than Jesus blood and righteousness.
[23:03] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but
[23:08] holy lean on Jesus name.
[23:14] On Christ the solid
[23:17] rock I stand.
[23:20] All other ground is sinking sand.
[23:26] All other ground is sinking sand.
[23:32] When darkness seems to hide his face,
[23:38] I rest on his unchanging grace.
[23:43] In every high and stormy gale, my anchor
[23:50] holds within the veil.
[23:54] On Christ the solid
[23:58] rock I stand.
[24:00] All other ground is sinking sand.
[24:06] All other ground is sinking sand.
[24:13] [Music]
[24:16] His oath is covenant
[24:19] and his blood
[24:22] support me in the whelming flood.
[24:27] When all around
[24:30] my soul gives way,
[24:32] he then is all my hope and stay.
[24:38] On Christ the solid
[24:41] rock I stand.
[24:44] All other ground is sinking sand.
[24:49] All other ground is sinking sand.
[24:58] when he shall come with trumpet sound.
[25:04] Oh, may I then
[25:07] be found dressed in his rightousness
[25:12] alone, fallless to stand before the
[25:18] throne.
[25:20] And he shall come with trumpet sound.
[25:25] Oh, may I then in him be found, dressed
[25:30] in his righteousness
[25:33] alone,
[25:35] faultless to stand before the throne.
[25:40] On Christ the solid
[25:44] rock I stand.
[25:46] All other ground is sinking sand.
[25:51] All other ground is sinking sand.
[25:58] On Christ the solid
[26:02] rock I stand.
[26:04] All other ground is sinking sand.
[26:10] All other ground is sinking sand.

[28:22] Um, I thank everybody for praying for my
[28:25] eyes. Uh, God's been good.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. When you guys come in
[28:31] that door there, when I shake your hand
[28:34] and greet you, I always say, "It's good
[28:36] to see you." I mean that literally.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; It's been a journey
[28:48] &gt;&gt; through this whole process, but God's
[28:49] been good. Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we go through trials
[28:54] and
[28:56] [Music]
[28:57] going through these trials, especially
[28:59] with with for me for vision things. It's
[29:01] been a kind of a lifelong thing
[29:04] and
[29:06] I trust God. But yet, there's still
[29:08] times I I got discouraged. I'll be quite
[29:10] honest with you.
[29:12] But you know what?
[29:16] I've determined
[29:18] that I am a son of God. Amen.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; We are sons and daughters of God.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; We have a privilege to ask what we have
[29:26] need of.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; We need to realize who we are.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; God is good all the time.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Hope the song blesses you.
[29:44] [Music]
[29:56] There have been times that I thought my
[29:59] prayers
[30:01] didn't even reach the ceiling
[30:04] of the room
[30:07] where I now to pray.
[30:12] And a voice inside kept asking me, "Did
[30:16] you think God was really listening
[30:20] to anything
[30:22] that I had to say?"
[30:25] [Music]
[30:27] But I kept on praying,
[30:31] holding on by faith, knowing God,
[30:36] he is always in control.
[30:42] And I waited like a rose bud in the
[30:46] garden
[30:49] cuz only God
[30:52] can unfold the rose.
[30:56] [Music]
[30:59] When God unfolds the rose,
[31:06] he always gets it right.
[31:14] when the petals are in place.
[31:18] [Music]
[31:20] Oh, it's such a beautiful
[31:23] sight.
[31:28] God knows when to hold on
[31:34] and the perfect time to let go.
[31:38] [Music]
[31:41] So let him have his way
[31:45] [Music]
[31:48] and let God unfold the roles.
[31:57] There are trials and tribulations
[32:01] we must all go through. When it comes
[32:05] the heartaches, we've all had our share.
[32:11] When times are the hardest, we need to
[32:15] hold on to the promise. He said he never
[32:19] give us more than we could bear.
[32:24] So I'll keep on praying,
[32:28] holding on by faith, knowing God is
[32:33] working all things for my good.
[32:38] And I'll wait just like a rose. But in
[32:42] the garden,
[32:44] for only God
[32:47] can unfold the rose.
[32:53] When God unfolds the road,
[33:00] he always gets it right.
[33:06] And when the pedals are in place,
[33:12] oh, it's such a beautiful sight.
[33:20] He knows when to hold on
[33:24] [Music]
[33:25] and the perfect time to let go.
[33:33] So let him have his way
[33:36] [Music]
[33:38] and watch God's love unfold the rose.
[33:46] When God unfolds the road,
[33:52] he always gets it right
[33:58] when the pedals are in place.
[34:04] Oh, it's such a beautiful sight.
[34:11] God knows when to hold on.
[34:17] and a perfect time to let go.
[34:24] So let him have his way
[34:27] [Music]
[34:30] and watch God unfold the rose.
[34:37] God knows when to hold on
[34:42] and the perfect time to let go.
[34:49] So let him have his way
[34:55] and watch God unfold the ro.
[35:01] [Applause]
[35:03] [Music]
[35:08] Amen.
[35:10] I was blessed by both of those songs.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give them both a round of
[35:15] applause.
[35:19] Amen.
[35:21] Can you pull up the words to In Christ
[35:22] Alone, key of Eflat? Key of Eflat. Let's
[35:26] stand and change the order of the
[35:27] service. Didn't have this song written
[35:29] down. It wasn't on my list, but he he
[35:32] wanted us to sing this song this
[35:34] morning. Where am I hiding? I'm hiding
[35:36] in Christ alone.
[35:39] Are you hiding in him this morning?
[35:42] In Christ alone,
[35:45] my hope is found.
[35:48] He is my life, my strength, my song.
[35:53] This quarter soul,
[35:56] this soul a crown
[35:59] firm through the fiercest drought and
[36:04] with heights of love. What depths of
[36:08] peace.
[36:10] Tears are shield when striving sequin.
[36:16] [Music]
[36:20] Oh, here in the blood of Christ I stand
[36:26] at Christ alone
[36:28] who took on fleshlessness
[36:32] of God in careless
[36:35] way. This gift of love and righteousness
[36:42] born by the ones he came to save. Still
[36:47] on that cross where Jesus died.
[36:52] The wrath of God was satisfied
[36:57] for every sin. My sin it was laid.
[37:03] Here in the death of Christ I live there
[37:08] in the ground. His body laid.
[37:14] Light of the world. My God has slained
[37:19] mercy.
[37:21] Oh glorious day. Amen. Up from the grave
[37:26] he rose
[37:28] again.
[37:29] And as he stands
[37:32] in victory glory
[37:36] has lost it on me for I have he and he
[37:43] is mine
[37:46] with a precious blood of Christ. No deal
[37:51] with life nor fear in death.
[37:56] This is the power of Christ.
[37:59] in me from life first try to final
[38:05] breath. Jesus Jesus commands my destiny.
[38:11] No power of hell. No seam of man can
[38:17] ever flock
[38:20] from his hand till he return
[38:25] and call me home.
[38:28] Here in the power of Christ
[38:32] I stand.
[38:34] [Music]
[38:40] Amen.
[38:42] God bless you all this morning. You can
[38:44] be seated for just a moment. And uh
[38:49] I just had a couple things that I wanted
[38:51] to say because at this very moment there
[38:54] is a memorial service going on for
[38:57] Charles Kirk. Over a 100,000 they may
[39:00] say 150,000 people have gathered
[39:04] together. People have flown from around
[39:06] the world to to be at that event. And uh
[39:10] um so um the name of his campaign, if
[39:17] any of you know, the name of his
[39:19] political platform was called Turning
[39:22] Point.
[39:23] Turning Point. Now, one thing that I
[39:26] totally enjoyed about him, I I can say I
[39:31] might have seen a clip or a little
[39:34] report
[39:35] uh something about what he did and how
[39:39] he went to college campuses prior to his
[39:42] getting shot
[39:45] for the and I was not a follower of
[39:48] Charles Kirk. I admired the fact of when
[39:51] I heard him debating with others, he was
[39:54] not ashamed
[39:55] &gt;&gt; to take a stand for the gospel, which I
[39:58] admire that.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Okay. And uh uh stuff, but I
[40:04] want you to understand debate has never
[40:07] caused the doubter to change his mind.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; There was never a aha moment. one of the
[40:15] Oh, so your stand on abortion is
[40:18] according to the scripture. Oh, I see it
[40:21] now. I'm on your side. No, no. What it
[40:24] was is it was a platform. Okay. Now, uh
[40:28] so I'm I'm not against anybody going
[40:30] out, but you're not going to win people
[40:32] by debate.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; You're going to win by preaching the
[40:36] gospel, living a life that is worthy of
[40:39] the gospel.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach a sermon.
[40:43] Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; And uh so
[40:46] uh
[40:48] I'm thinking is this a significant event
[40:54] &gt;&gt; not only here in America
[40:56] &gt;&gt; but globally?
[40:58] &gt;&gt; What does it signify?
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Is it possible?
[41:02] Is it possible that the foolish virgin
[41:05] right now
[41:06] &gt;&gt; are saying, "Oh my,"
[41:08] &gt;&gt; because you see when the door was
[41:12] closing, the foolish virgin went to seek
[41:14] for oil.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; And we know they don't get it,
[41:22] &gt;&gt; but they went to seek
[41:24] &gt;&gt; to find oil.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; So, there is a stirring going on right
[41:29] now.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. And we don't deny that.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; And um he used Charles Kirk used his
[41:39] political platform to try to persuade
[41:44] others to look at the his viewpoint,
[41:48] perhaps his his belief, his opinion, his
[41:52] uh the the way that he saw things.
[41:57] Um,
[42:02] college campuses have not become a place
[42:06] of education but a place of
[42:08] indoctrination.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; It's changed.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; And hatred and violence has become the
[42:18] norm.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Make your viewpoint known
[42:24] and they will hate you. Jesus said,
[42:26] "You'll be hated
[42:28] &gt;&gt; because you're associated with me. If
[42:30] they hated me, they're going to hate you
[42:32] also."
[42:34] &gt;&gt; So your mere association with Jesus
[42:36] Christ and what you believe, people will
[42:38] hate you without a cause.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; It will be a time where they will call
[42:42] evil good and good evil. They will be
[42:46] despisers of those that are good,
[42:49] &gt;&gt; hateful, unthankful. We have reached a
[42:53] turning point here in America. But let
[42:56] me because if you want to take I I just
[42:59] thought I last night I thought you know
[43:02] I wonder if brother Brennham said
[43:03] anything about turning point
[43:08] &gt;&gt; be interested in 1956
[43:11] in the sermon making a way he says now
[43:15] be praying over these do and pray hard.
[43:17] I just feel we haven't got much time
[43:20] now. 1956,
[43:23] we haven't got much time now. And I
[43:25] predict, I don't say this is the Lord
[43:27] saying this now. I'm predicting that
[43:29] this year America will receive Christ or
[43:32] reject Christ.
[43:36] I believe this will be a turning point
[43:40] that America will go in. We'll have a
[43:43] revival in this day or we won't have a
[43:46] revival. And I believe that this is the
[43:48] year that America makes its decision.
[43:53] I trust that they'll make it and we'll
[43:54] have a great revival that'll just sweep.
[43:57] We're having much preaching and much
[43:59] evangelism, but we need a revival, don't
[44:02] we? A real revival.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; That's what we need. The Lord bless you.
[44:07] So we can see the prophet of God was
[44:09] even seeing America was heading in a
[44:12] direction
[44:15] &gt;&gt; and he was trying to turn them
[44:20] &gt;&gt; preaching the gospel signs and wonders a
[44:23] vindicated ministry that outeclipsed any
[44:27] minister in this day.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; And so we see there's a turning point
[44:33] here in America. It's happening. and for
[44:36] us to ignore it. I want you to
[44:40] understand
[44:41] that it will get worse and worse.
[44:44] This is not a time where there's this
[44:47] great awakening happening in America and
[44:51] churches are going to get filled again
[44:53] and people are going to come to Christ
[44:55] and and uh barrooms are going to close,
[44:58] pornography sites are going to be shut
[45:00] down, movies that are uh
[45:04] no, it's not going to happen.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says u there's a turning
[45:09] point here in America. And she did turn,
[45:12] but she turned in the wrong direction.
[45:14] Now she's swn to the wind. She shall
[45:16] reap a whirlwind. He said, 'I don't pray
[45:18] for her anymore. So I want you to all
[45:21] understand that this movement that is
[45:24] even in happening. Now watch. His wife
[45:27] says, "The legacy of my husband, I will
[45:30] carry it on."
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, is she going to go on the
[45:34] debate platform and go out and debate on
[45:36] campuses? I doubt it. She what she's
[45:39] going to do is keep the legacy of uh the
[45:43] platform that he opened of turning uh
[45:47] you know turning point.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. And so, uh, but I also think that
[45:54] we have another woman that's rising
[45:57] &gt;&gt; who her turning point
[46:00] &gt;&gt; was a long time ago
[46:02] &gt;&gt; by what God was showing you
[46:06] &gt;&gt; and it caused your life to be directly
[46:09] affected.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; And there was a turning. I can tell all
[46:13] of you in 1971
[46:15] when I came and first heard about this
[46:18] message I had my personal turning point.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; It has affected me in every facet of my
[46:26] life.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Can any of you say it happened to me
[46:29] also? I've I've had a turning point.
[46:32] There's been a change of mind, a change
[46:34] of direction.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Thank God that's why you're here. I
[46:38] trust each one of you uh would be of
[46:42] that same opinion. Amen. Now, we could
[46:45] debate it all we want. I could try to
[46:48] win you over to my viewpoint by debating
[46:51] it.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Don't happen.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Unless God opens the eyes, all you do is
[46:58] have a heated debate.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; If you've ever had a debate with
[47:03] somebody, a lot of times it just doesn't
[47:05] end well. But the nice thing about those
[47:09] that even wanted to debate with the
[47:12] prophet of God, he always had the right
[47:14] spirit.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; God help us to have the right attitude.
[47:21] Amen. Let's stand together.
[47:30] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; That's what I want. Amen.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want just a change of mind. I
[47:40] want a change of heart.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; I want to be more like him.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of this gospel.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; If there's one thing that maybe we would
[47:50] learn out of this whole thing is be not
[47:54] ashamed to stand for what you believe.
[47:56] Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; To be able to give an answer to those
[48:00] that ask you, "Why do you believe what
[48:03] you believe?"
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you will find out right away
[48:07] whether or not you understand what you
[48:10] believe or you just said, "Well, my
[48:12] religion says
[48:13] &gt;&gt; it's not a religion. It's a
[48:15] relationship."
[48:17] &gt;&gt; And the greatest weapon of our warfare
[48:21] is the word of God.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Let every man's word be a lie,
[48:28] &gt;&gt; but mine be the truth.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Open the eyes of my heart, Brother
[48:34] Robert.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[48:41] Open the eyes of my heart.
[48:45] I want to see you.
[48:51] I want to see you.
[48:56] [Music]
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[49:03] [Music]
[49:04] Open the eyes of my heart.
[49:08] I want to see you.
[49:13] [Music]
[49:14] &gt;&gt; I want to see you.
[49:18] See you high and lifted up.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; See you high and lifted up.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, shining in the light of your glory.
[49:33] Pour out your power and love
[49:37] as we sing. Holy, holy, holy.
[49:45] I want to see you.
[49:51] I want to see you.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; It's our prayer.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[50:01] It is our prayer that we want to see
[50:03] you.
[50:04] [Music]
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that this morning as we
[50:08] have gathered together here in your
[50:10] name, we recognize that you're here. But
[50:13] father, may there be a revealing of your
[50:16] word to our hearts.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Not of our knowledge and carnal
[50:25] understanding,
[50:26] but of true revelation that only comes
[50:29] from you.
[50:31] I pray may the Holy Spirit have
[50:33] preeminence this morning
[50:36] &gt;&gt; and use my vessel
[50:39] as a voice.
[50:43] May it not be my voice, but may it be
[50:45] your voice, the voice of the Holy Spirit
[50:48] speaking to your people.
[50:51] Father, I thank you for this day. We
[50:53] honor your resurrection. We thank you,
[50:56] Father, for every testimony and every
[50:59] life of those that are here, those
[51:02] perhaps archiving the service later.
[51:04] Perhaps those that are streaming around
[51:07] the world or even right here in Arizona
[51:10] right now.
[51:12] I pray may you bless each and everyone
[51:15] as we go into the word of God now.
[51:20] Break unto us the bread of life
[51:22] &gt;&gt; as only you can. I pray in Jesus
[51:25] Christ's name. Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you musicians each and every
[51:30] one. God bless you. Let's just remain
[51:32] standing and turn with me in your
[51:34] Bibles. Please turn with me in your
[51:36] Bibles to Acts chapter 2 verses 37 and
[51:40] 39. Enjoyed the song specials. Thank
[51:43] you.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; I'm always blessed when you use your
[51:48] gift for the glory of God. You know,
[51:49] sometimes God will change a heart or
[51:52] deal with somebody through your song
[51:54] special.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever been affected
[51:57] by somebody singing a song and said,
[51:58] "Wow, that was for me. You nailed it."
[52:02] &gt;&gt; That's why it's not with trained voices
[52:05] we get up here and and and we want to
[52:08] show off and how good we can sing and
[52:12] the notes and how long we can hold them.
[52:14] No, but just a heart that is willing to
[52:18] make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that God put that in the
[52:24] Bible, a joyful noise, because that's
[52:26] what I make,
[52:26] &gt;&gt; more of a noise, but I pray that it be a
[52:29] joyful one that it really it comes from
[52:31] the heart. So, each and every one of
[52:33] you, it's so good to have you all out
[52:35] here. Eric and Kylie, it's good to have
[52:37] you here. I know you go back down under
[52:40] um tomorrow, but even though you live
[52:43] down under, may you rise above the down
[52:46] under
[52:48] to be an overcomer.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We love you guys, each and
[52:53] every one. Acts 2:37 and 39.
[52:57] Amen.
[52:59] Now, when they heard this, they were
[53:01] pricricked in their heart. Now, here is
[53:03] the Holy Spirit coming down anointing
[53:05] Peter the spokesman.
[53:08] And watch this. And when they heard
[53:11] this, when they saw the disciples there
[53:15] and the different ones that were in the
[53:17] upper room, and they heard him speak the
[53:19] wonderful words of God
[53:21] &gt;&gt; in their own tongue, wherein they were
[53:23] born,
[53:24] &gt;&gt; it pricricked their hearts.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; And said unto Peter and the rest of the
[53:29] apostles, men and brethren,
[53:32] what shall we do?
[53:34] Then Peter said to them,"Repent and be
[53:36] baptized, every one of you in the name
[53:39] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[53:42] sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
[53:44] the Holy Ghost." For the promise, what
[53:47] promise is he talking about? The promise
[53:49] of receiving the Holy Spirit.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; So the promise is unto you and to your
[53:56] children, and to all that are a far off,
[53:59] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[54:02] call. Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word.
[54:05] You may be seated this morning in the
[54:07] presence of God. I'd like to title my
[54:10] sermon this morning. I've got um quite a
[54:14] bit that's on my heart. I've got a long
[54:16] ways to go. I will be reading quite a
[54:19] bit. But I want to speak this morning on
[54:22] what shall we do to be saved?
[54:26] &gt;&gt; And I want to take a subject of saved
[54:30] but not sealed.
[54:32] And I want to look at the difference of
[54:34] what brother Brennham's and the
[54:37] scripture
[54:38] what the viewpoint is on being having
[54:42] salvation
[54:44] but being sealed
[54:46] &gt;&gt; two different things.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; So we're going to look at it and some of
[54:52] you that have joined our church have
[54:57] moved here have come here in the last
[55:00] few years. Many of you have not been
[55:03] with us over the years where we sat down
[55:06] and we went over these things in great
[55:09] detail. So what I do is I'm just going
[55:12] to hit some of this as highlights and
[55:15] put those who know this already just put
[55:17] you in remembrance of that which you
[55:20] already know.
[55:22] Now um so I want to clarify something
[55:26] this morning so that all of you will
[55:28] understand this that there is a vast
[55:31] difference between church and bride.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; There's a vast difference between having
[55:40] salvation,
[55:41] okay, and being bride.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. And we're going to show
[55:47] you that there is this difference of
[55:50] just being born again
[55:53] and then going to the place of adoption
[55:56] which is placing.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. So um we want to be very clear on
[56:03] that. And in the sermon in why I'm
[56:08] against organized religion remember I
[56:10] believe that Martin Luther had the Holy
[56:12] Spirit. Absolutely.
[56:15] maybe not in the portion it is today
[56:17] because it wasn't given out. So, we've
[56:20] been through this you people of the
[56:22] tabernacle here on the blackboard, but
[56:24] he did believe to God and he that
[56:27] believeth has everlasting life. I never
[56:30] thought there was a person believed like
[56:33] me till this morning. Do any of you see
[56:36] the date on that?
[56:40] I
[56:41] never thought there was a person that
[56:44] believed
[56:45] like me till this morning.
[56:49] I heard Charles Fuller, a minister of
[56:52] the gospel.
[56:54] As I was going uh down, he believes too
[56:58] that the new birth is not the baptism of
[57:01] the Holy Ghost. The new birth is being
[57:03] born again. Is being born. The Holy
[57:07] Ghost is the baptism. So he says, now
[57:10] isn't this amazing? He says, of all the
[57:13] people, you would have thought that all
[57:15] those years everybody was on the same
[57:17] page, believed exactly what brother and
[57:20] brother Brennham said, look, all these
[57:22] years of ministry, what I've been trying
[57:24] to do is to get them to understand
[57:28] about the new birth.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; And he goes into, remember, he was born
[57:34] in 1909. The church age of Ladya had
[57:38] already begun.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; He was born into the time of
[57:43] Pentecostalism.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; So it was in a full swing as he was
[57:50] born. It already began to just uh it was
[57:53] a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[57:55] you know as street on and on. Now
[57:59] understand that the book of Revelation
[58:01] speaks about seven church ages. Ephesus,
[58:05] thy tyra and so on. But in every age,
[58:09] God sends a messenger.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; And that messenger is the messenger to
[58:15] the whole age.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And may I say this to seed and nonseed.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; He is the messenger whether they receive
[58:27] him or not, whether they hear him or
[58:29] not. He's still the messenger for the
[58:31] age. And they will be judged. Amen.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; By what he has brought forth.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; So
[58:40] we know that the Bible says in Amos 3
[58:43] and seven, surely the Lord God will do
[58:46] nothing but what he send it or reveal it
[58:49] to his servants, the prophets.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; So God is obligated to his word. Now
[58:56] though he addresses the whole church and
[58:59] the whole age,
[59:01] I want you to notice that there is only
[59:03] one specified particular group that will
[59:07] receive what the spirit is saying to the
[59:10] church.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Not everyone will receive it.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; But there is someone who's predestinated
[59:18] and ordained
[59:19] &gt;&gt; to hear that message.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham said she will be
[59:23] minority. Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; He says in fact she will be eight times
[59:29] smaller
[59:32] &gt;&gt; than the church.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; We'll substantiate that here in just a
[59:36] moment. Now many will hear but they
[59:39] don't understand. Many will see but they
[59:42] comprehend not.
[59:45] They will hear the angel messenger and
[59:48] though he be vindicated of God and
[59:50] proven and vindicated by God with signs
[59:52] and wonders, that doesn't make them a
[59:55] believer.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; They just see he's a great man of God.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Signs don't make you a believer.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Signs get your attention. So in the
[1:00:06] sermon, the voice of the sign, Brother
[1:00:08] Bram says in 1964, just like he's doing
[1:00:12] now, going to bring a bride out of a
[1:00:15] church, leaving the remnant of the
[1:00:18] woman's seed, the elected will be
[1:00:20] brought out of the church. The church
[1:00:22] natural will stay here through the
[1:00:25] tribulation.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; You understand that? You miss this
[1:00:29] rapture.
[1:00:31] Yes.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; What do you think the spirit of
[1:00:36] anti-semitism and anti-Christianity
[1:00:39] where it's going to head up?
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Tribulation.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; And what are they going to do? Martyr.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Who are they going to martyr? The
[1:00:49] foolish virgin.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Who are they also going to martyr? The
[1:00:54] 144,000.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Who are they also going to martyr?
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Moses and Elijah. the two witnesses. So,
[1:01:02] do you understand what's happening right
[1:01:04] now? The hatred and violence.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; They will try to silence the voice not
[1:01:10] by debate
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; but by violence.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; To take their lives.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; So, it's happening.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; It's happening right here. God, help us
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; to not be ashamed.
[1:01:30] to stand for truth in this very hour.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:01:36] Um
[1:01:38] the elected will be brought out of the
[1:01:41] church. The church natural will stay
[1:01:43] here through the tribulation. That
[1:01:45] elected sometime is called the chosen
[1:01:47] elected remnant. Now the Bible says that
[1:01:50] many are chosen. Excuse me. Many are
[1:01:53] called but few are chosen.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; So one of the parables where this is
[1:02:00] kind of explained, Jesus talks about
[1:02:04] that there was a king who had a wedding
[1:02:06] for his son and many were invited and
[1:02:09] there was some that came and there was a
[1:02:12] wedding garment that you had to have on
[1:02:14] as you were a guest. You were giving a
[1:02:16] wedding garment. How many know that's
[1:02:18] what the Bible says? So in Matthew 22
[1:02:24] 11-14 and when the king came to see the
[1:02:27] guests, he saw there was a man which had
[1:02:30] not on a wedding garment,
[1:02:34] which he saith unto him, friend,
[1:02:37] how camest thou in hither not having a
[1:02:39] wedding garment? And he was speechless.
[1:02:44] And he saith und and then the king said
[1:02:47] to his servants bind him hand and foot
[1:02:53] and take him away
[1:02:55] and cast him into outer darkness. Now
[1:02:58] that doesn't sound like a loving God.
[1:03:03] That doesn't sound so kind to me.
[1:03:06] Well, I'm sorry, buddy. You didn't have
[1:03:07] your garment on. Well, listen. I tell
[1:03:09] you what. We got an extra one in the
[1:03:11] coat closet here. Go get him a garment.
[1:03:13] No, let me tell you that this kind,
[1:03:17] benevolent, loving, forgiving God will
[1:03:19] one day turn to a God of wrath.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; To spurn what God has given to you now
[1:03:26] for you to make yourself ready. If you
[1:03:28] spurn it, you will face the wrath of
[1:03:30] God. And so what he did, he cast him out
[1:03:33] into outer darkness. Brother Brim said,
[1:03:35] "What was that? Tribulation."
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; I cannot think of a more horrible time
[1:03:41] that a man was there. He was shaking
[1:03:43] hands. He was there um hugging necks.
[1:03:46] Hey brother, we're here. We made it.
[1:03:48] He's the only one that doesn't have his
[1:03:49] garment.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; How did you get in?
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; You ever had a dream that you were the
[1:03:56] only one that didn't have the right
[1:03:59] garment on or something and and you
[1:04:01] stood out and you you But see now he was
[1:04:04] cast out into outer darkness.
[1:04:08] Now watch. Bind him hand and foot.
[1:04:10] Cassim out where there was weeping and
[1:04:12] nashing of teeth but many are called but
[1:04:15] few are chosen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Second Peter 1 and10 the Bible says
[1:04:22] wherefore the rather brethren give
[1:04:24] diligence to make your calling and your
[1:04:27] election sure
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; if you do these things you shall never
[1:04:31] fall. Now that word fall does not mean
[1:04:33] you won't make mistakes.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; You'll never fall away from the truth.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Now so what is the wedding garment? What
[1:04:44] is the wedding garment? It is a symbol.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Remember the Bible is a book of symbols
[1:04:50] and once you know the symbols it
[1:04:52] interprets itself.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; So brother Brennham says in Revelation
[1:04:56] chapter 4 1960 then if the wedding
[1:05:00] garment is the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:02] Spirit how are we going to be
[1:05:04] represented any other way? The first
[1:05:07] church age had to come by the door
[1:05:09] Christ Jesus. He baptized in the name of
[1:05:13] Jesus Christ. Receive the baptism of the
[1:05:16] Holy Ghost to put on the wedding
[1:05:18] garment.
[1:05:20] You see what the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:22] Ghost is? Wedding garment
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; in God's provided way. 53.
[1:05:27] Brethren, there's no big me and little
[1:05:29] you. Then when you come by the way of
[1:05:31] the door, when he found a man back there
[1:05:33] that didn't have a wedding garment on,
[1:05:35] he come in some other way besides the
[1:05:37] door because Jesus said, "I am the
[1:05:39] door."
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; I am the gate to the sheepfold.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Every man that comes by the door is
[1:05:46] going to get the same road.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; And that robe is the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:52] Ghost.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] Now, just as there was an Exodus in the
[1:05:59] days of Moses with the children of
[1:06:02] Israel, we too are also in another
[1:06:06] Exodus.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; And we look at that Exodus, it gives us
[1:06:10] a type and shadow of what to expect in
[1:06:13] this. Because as it was, so shall it be.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; So that's why Brother Bram said, "I'm a
[1:06:19] typologist. I go back into the Bible. I
[1:06:21] see what happened then. I see how they
[1:06:24] handled it then. I see what went on then
[1:06:27] and I can see what's going to happen in
[1:06:30] the future.
[1:06:32] And brother Brennham says in the sermon
[1:06:34] the token and now it's a type of today
[1:06:37] shown as we are also facing another
[1:06:39] exodus. God bringing Israel out of G uh
[1:06:44] Egypt to the promised land. He was a
[1:06:47] type of Christ bringing the bride out of
[1:06:50] the church
[1:06:52] to the promised land. We are in another
[1:06:55] exodus.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; As God brought a nation out of a nation,
[1:07:00] God will bring a bride out of a church.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; The bride will be called from all the
[1:07:07] churches.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; It'll be the elect of God and we'll be
[1:07:11] brought out.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is coming to take a bride out
[1:07:16] of a church.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; So, I don't want to just say, "Praise
[1:07:20] God, I'm in the church."
[1:07:23] I don't want to just say I'm called.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just say I'm caught up
[1:07:27] into this movement.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; But I want the movement in me.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; I want it to be such a stirring
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; that it causes a change.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; The church has heard the messenger. They
[1:07:43] have eaten the heavenly mana. They drank
[1:07:45] of the rock and that rock was Christ. We
[1:07:47] found the Bible showing us examples of
[1:07:50] this. 1 Corinthians 10:es 1-8.
[1:07:54] Moreover, brethren, I would not that you
[1:07:57] should be ignorant how that all our
[1:07:59] fathers were baptized under the cloud
[1:08:02] and all bapt uh passed through the sea.
[1:08:05] And all were baptized unto Moses. Now, I
[1:08:08] want you to understand Moses baptized no
[1:08:11] one.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; His movement was an anointing that they
[1:08:16] came under. It baptized them with an
[1:08:19] anointed word.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; All baptized unto Moses in the cloud and
[1:08:26] in the sea. And did all eat the same
[1:08:29] spiritual meat.
[1:08:31] All did drink of the same spiritual
[1:08:34] drink. And they drank of that spiritual
[1:08:37] rock that followed them. And that rock
[1:08:40] was Christ.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were a part of
[1:08:44] something.
[1:08:46] But with many of them God was not well
[1:08:49] pleased.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Here's the warning.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; For they were overthrown in the
[1:08:54] wilderness.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Now these things were for our examples.
[1:08:59] Is that right?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; To the intent we should not lust after
[1:09:02] evil things as they also lusted, neither
[1:09:06] be idoltors
[1:09:09] as were some of them. And the people sat
[1:09:12] down to eat and drink and rose up to
[1:09:14] play. This is not a time to play saints.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Neither let us commit fornication
[1:09:20] as some of them committed and fell in
[1:09:23] one day. Three and 20,000
[1:09:27] in one day
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; committing fornication against Christ,
[1:09:32] the revealed word of that hour.
[1:09:36] In the sermon, the voice of the sign,
[1:09:39] watch, God typed, God was bringing
[1:09:42] Israel, his people, out of a nation, a
[1:09:44] nation out of a nation.
[1:09:47] A nation out of a nation. Beautiful type
[1:09:50] of today that God is calling his bride
[1:09:52] out of a church. Christian bride out of
[1:09:56] a Christian church. A bride church out
[1:10:01] of a church which is called in the
[1:10:03] Bible.
[1:10:05] So I want you to understand
[1:10:09] that those that came out of Egypt,
[1:10:12] brother Brennham said every great
[1:10:14] ministry within the scripture has three
[1:10:16] pulls.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; And he says and even Moses had three
[1:10:23] pulls. Elijah had three pulls.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; So under the first and second pull, they
[1:10:30] were all in a movement.
[1:10:33] But it wasn't until the ministry changed
[1:10:37] and God spoke to Joshua and told him,
[1:10:40] "As I was with Moses,
[1:10:42] I'm going to be with you."
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; It was the same spirit, different
[1:10:47] ministry.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; The ministry was changing, but using a
[1:10:55] different vessel.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; This ministry of the end time
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; is changing also.
[1:11:03] It's the same spirit but in a different
[1:11:06] vessel.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; God in morpha changing his mask.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; The same spirit was in Christ is now in
[1:11:15] the church.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; But then out of the church, God is
[1:11:19] calling a bride.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to just revel in the
[1:11:23] fact, praise God, I've been called out.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; You see, because redemption has two
[1:11:28] parts. Coming out of and going into. Too
[1:11:32] many people have come out and they revel
[1:11:34] in the fact I've come out. Don't just
[1:11:36] say I came out. Let's say let's go in.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; They all saw the first and second pull,
[1:11:51] but they failed to catch what God was
[1:11:53] doing under the Joshua ministry
[1:11:57] where he placed them where they should
[1:12:00] be.
[1:12:01] And there was some of those that came
[1:12:03] out under that ministry. If you know
[1:12:06] that uh when they were getting ready to
[1:12:08] cross over, some said, "We'll just stay
[1:12:10] here. We're kind of satisfied."
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; And they didn't even cross over Jordan.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; So, we can see types within the message
[1:12:19] who have gone no further than coming
[1:12:21] out.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; They didn't cross over. God help us.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; So in Hebrews chapter 3, we pick this
[1:12:32] up. Harden not your hearts as in the
[1:12:35] provocation in the day of temptation in
[1:12:38] the wilderness. When your fathers
[1:12:40] tempted me, prove me and saw my works 40
[1:12:42] years.
[1:12:44] Wherefore I was grieved with that
[1:12:46] generation and said, they do always heir
[1:12:49] in their heart and they have not known
[1:12:52] my ways.
[1:12:54] So I swear in my wrath they shall not
[1:12:56] enter into my rest. What is rest? The
[1:12:59] Holy Spirit.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; That is the divine promise. And I've
[1:13:03] promised to give you a rest. Not as the
[1:13:05] world gives. I'll give you a peace. I'll
[1:13:07] give you a rest.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "The Sabbath of this
[1:13:11] day is the Holy Spirit."
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; So I swear in my wrath, they shall not
[1:13:16] enter into my rest. Take heed, brethren,
[1:13:20] lest there be any of you an evil heart
[1:13:23] of unbelief in departing from the living
[1:13:26] God. But exhort one another daily, which
[1:13:29] is called today, lest any of you should
[1:13:31] be hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:13:34] sin.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; What is sin? Unbelief.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; So we see verse 19. So we see they could
[1:13:47] not enter in because of unbelief.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; If any of you do not make it, it's
[1:13:55] because you allowed unbelief.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not faith. Unbelief. Well, I doubt
[1:14:06] that. I doubt this and I doubt that.
[1:14:09] Don't be a doubter. Be a believer. Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask, "Do you understand it
[1:14:16] all?"
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you believe?"
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:1, "Let us therefore fear,
[1:14:24] lest a promise being left us of entering
[1:14:27] into his rest, any of you should come
[1:14:30] short of it.
[1:14:32] For unto us was the gospel preached as
[1:14:35] well as unto them."
[1:14:38] But the word preached did not profit
[1:14:40] them.
[1:14:42] not being mixed with faith in them that
[1:14:45] heard it. Do you see? It's not just
[1:14:48] hearing.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; It's not just playing a tape.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; It's not just hearing the five-fold
[1:14:53] ministry.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; It's not just hearing the voice
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; speaking.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? But it's having faith
[1:15:03] mixed with what you've heard.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Don't just come to church and say, "Wow,
[1:15:08] that that was good." and minister spoke
[1:15:11] with with with uh zeal and he he raised
[1:15:15] his voice and he he seemed to be
[1:15:18] persuasive.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Do you see? I don't want you to just be
[1:15:22] moved by some kind of emotion.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to be moved by the Holy
[1:15:27] Spirit that causes your life.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; That you cease from what you did. That
[1:15:34] you turn from your way. And you don't
[1:15:36] let unbelief rule you, but you let faith
[1:15:39] rule you.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Faith is revelation.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; It's not knowledge.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Now, let me continue on with this
[1:15:55] thought.
[1:15:56] Saved but not sealed.
[1:15:59] Remember
[1:16:01] this church that when you are born
[1:16:03] again,
[1:16:04] you are babes in Christ. The natural is
[1:16:08] a type of the spiritual.
[1:16:12] So, praise the Lord. God bless you.
[1:16:14] Except a man be born again, he cannot
[1:16:16] understand the things of God. Right? And
[1:16:20] so, the new birth just starts your
[1:16:22] journey.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; You become a babe in Christ, sincere
[1:16:26] milk of the word. You hear the love of
[1:16:28] God. Oh, wonderful. Every sermon you
[1:16:30] hear when you first come to God is all
[1:16:32] about God's love. Oh, oh, God loves him.
[1:16:35] Take that little bottle and you suck on
[1:16:38] it and man, everything is God's love.
[1:16:41] But then you start growing up,
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; okay? And you start learning to walk.
[1:16:47] And when you learn to walk, you fall.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And you make mistakes and you get
[1:16:51] weapons.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Huh? Yeah. You learn obedience by the
[1:16:57] things you suffer.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. You can tell your child not to do
[1:17:03] it. And if there is no consequence when
[1:17:06] they overdo or go over your word and
[1:17:10] there's no consequence, they're going to
[1:17:12] smile at you and just laugh when you
[1:17:16] tell them you're going to get it because
[1:17:17] you never get them.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Spoil the rod and you spoil the child.
[1:17:24] Spare the rod.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Once in a while, you need a
[1:17:29] good-looking.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. As many as I love,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; I rebuke and I chasen. Be zealous,
[1:17:39] therefore,
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; and repent. That means quit doing what
[1:17:42] you did.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; I remember my mother, very quick little
[1:17:46] testimony. little boy. My parents, we
[1:17:49] went out. We lived right next to an old
[1:17:53] um chicken um place where they processed
[1:17:57] chickens. And in there uh they had all
[1:18:00] the hundreds of thousands of the feet of
[1:18:03] chicken and parts of chicken and and it
[1:18:06] was just an old dirty dilapidated down
[1:18:09] building and was filthy and stunk, but
[1:18:12] it was just a great place for boys to
[1:18:14] play.
[1:18:16] Wow, look at this. The feet we you know.
[1:18:19] Anyway, and and so my my my mother had
[1:18:23] said, "You stay away from that. That is
[1:18:25] contaminated. It's filthy. If you go
[1:18:28] over there, you're going to get in
[1:18:29] trouble." So we didn't listen. We went
[1:18:31] over there anyway and we came back and
[1:18:34] mom had seen us crossing the field going
[1:18:36] in that direction. Where have you boys
[1:18:38] been? Um, she says, "Well, listen before
[1:18:43] you say, I'll tell you if you if you
[1:18:45] tell me the truth, you'll never get a
[1:18:46] weapon."
[1:18:49] Wow. Where'd you go? We went to the
[1:18:52] chicken coop.
[1:18:56] Guess.
[1:18:58] So, she said, "Okay, thank you for
[1:19:00] telling me the truth. Now, you boys,
[1:19:02] I've told you, and I'm not going to tell
[1:19:03] you again. Don't you do that again."
[1:19:06] Next day, we went over there. She said,
[1:19:08] "Where have you boys been?" We said,
[1:19:09] "Chicken coop."
[1:19:11] We were taken in the back room and
[1:19:13] beaten.
[1:19:16] But I was so confused because you said,
[1:19:18] "If I tell you the truth on the Yeah.
[1:19:21] Well,
[1:19:23] that was yesterday. You didn't learn,
[1:19:25] did you? You didn't hear the the rest of
[1:19:27] the story."
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's have a Paul Harvey on
[1:19:31] this thing.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; There's the rest of the story. You You
[1:19:34] go out and you do wrong. Now,
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; after you've been warned, you're going
[1:19:39] to get a weapon. So, I want you to
[1:19:41] understand, uh, you are not born mature
[1:19:45] Christians.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; There's never been a sister that goes to
[1:19:49] the hospital, comes home, that's got a
[1:19:51] baby is the size of Brother David.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; I know some of you have had big babies,
[1:19:59] but they were never that big.
[1:20:01] They were born children,
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; infants, babies, and they grow mature.
[1:20:09] Now I want you to see in Galatians 4:es
[1:20:12] 1 and two. Now I say that the heir as
[1:20:15] long as he is a child
[1:20:19] differ from a servant, though he be Lord
[1:20:22] of all. So a servant and an heir.
[1:20:26] There's no difference in the two of
[1:20:28] them,
[1:20:29] but is under tutors and governors until
[1:20:32] the time appointed of the father.
[1:20:36] So there comes a time when it's
[1:20:39] appointed of the father. You are under
[1:20:41] tutors and governor. Every one of you
[1:20:43] have a report card that is being taken
[1:20:46] back to your heavenly father asking
[1:20:49] how's my son doing?
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. How's my daughter doing?
[1:20:53] Uh, well, uh,
[1:21:01] I wonder what your report card says.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; If somebody's taking a report back, are
[1:21:07] they obedient?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; They're having a struggle.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Are they being foolish because they're
[1:21:16] not doing what I say? So anyway, I want
[1:21:18] you to understand that in Galatians 4:es
[1:21:21] 4-7, but when the fullness of the time
[1:21:23] was come, God sent forth his son made of
[1:21:27] a woman, made under the law, to redeem
[1:21:30] them that were under the law, that we
[1:21:32] might receive the adoption of sons.
[1:21:36] And because ye are sons, God has sent
[1:21:38] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:21:41] hearts, crying, aba, father.
[1:21:45] Wherefore thou art no more a servant,
[1:21:48] but a son, and if a son, than an heir of
[1:21:51] God through Christ.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brennham begins to deal
[1:21:58] with issues, even uh doctrinal issues
[1:22:03] that were incorrect.
[1:22:05] And yet, he's heard of all these things.
[1:22:07] I want to show you this, show you this
[1:22:09] quote on the sermon, you must be born
[1:22:11] again.
[1:22:13] He says, "People are told out on the
[1:22:15] West Coast." Now, now he's repeating
[1:22:18] what they have been teaching. Oh, we got
[1:22:22] an immortal baptism.
[1:22:26] We baptize you in water and turn you
[1:22:28] right back into a young man right there,
[1:22:30] a young woman.
[1:22:32] Now, I know, let me just take you a
[1:22:34] little bit further. I know some that say
[1:22:35] when you are baptized into Christ
[1:22:39] and though you've been married two or
[1:22:41] three times that now you're now a
[1:22:43] virgin. You're turned back into a virgin
[1:22:46] and you can just marry uh anybody that
[1:22:55] well the new birth that changes it all.
[1:22:58] No, let's go to the doctrinal teaching.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:23:04] So
[1:23:07] he says, "Oh, we got the Elijah's
[1:23:08] garments.
[1:23:10] They've got manifested sons of God."
[1:23:13] Yes, sir, brother. God's getting
[1:23:15] manifested sons right now. Manifesting.
[1:23:18] Tell them all about this. Tonight you're
[1:23:20] a sinner. Tomorrow you're a manifested
[1:23:22] son of God. Nonsense.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Where do you get that in the word?
[1:23:29] Babies are not born men. They're born
[1:23:31] babies and grow to men. Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Do you see his doctrinal teaching?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You learn
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; how to serve God even by your mistakes.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; All of you will make mistakes.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And I have found out just about the time
[1:23:49] I think I'm doing real well, I make even
[1:23:51] a worse mistake. And then I realize, oh
[1:23:53] God, I need your grace.
[1:23:56] Now
[1:23:59] Paul picks this up in Corinthians in 1
[1:24:02] Corinthians 13:11. When I was a child,
[1:24:06] I spake as a child, understood as a
[1:24:09] child, I thought as a child. Nothing
[1:24:11] wrong with being a child.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; It's just never growing up is the
[1:24:17] problem.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; But when I became a man, that's a
[1:24:20] differentiation.
[1:24:22] When I became a man,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; I put away childish things.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 5
[1:24:30] 11 and onward. Of whom we have many
[1:24:33] things to say and hard to be uttered,
[1:24:36] seeing you are dull of hearing.
[1:24:41] For when for the time you ought to be
[1:24:43] teachers, you need have need of one
[1:24:45] teach you again, which be the first
[1:24:47] principles of the oracles of God, and
[1:24:50] you become of some of as such as have
[1:24:54] need of milk and not of strong meat.
[1:24:58] For everyone that uses milk is
[1:25:00] unskillful in the word of righteousness,
[1:25:02] for he is a babe.
[1:25:05] But strong meat belongs to them that are
[1:25:07] of full age, even who by reason of use
[1:25:13] have their senses exercised to discern
[1:25:17] both good and evil. Hebrews 6:1.
[1:25:19] Therefore, leaving the principles of the
[1:25:22] doctrine of Christ. This is amazing.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Wait a second. What are you talking
[1:25:28] about, brother?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Leaving the doctrines of Christ.
[1:25:34] God forbid.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Watch what he's saying. Let us go on
[1:25:39] unto perfection. Let's go on unto
[1:25:42] maturity.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Not laying again the foundation of
[1:25:47] repentance from dead works and of faith
[1:25:49] towards God.
[1:25:51] Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of the
[1:25:54] laying on of hands, and of resurrection
[1:25:57] of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
[1:26:00] Let's go beyond these things. Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Let me show you what the prophet said
[1:26:05] about being born again. Here is the
[1:26:08] prophet's definition of the new birth.
[1:26:12] I'm interested.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; In the sermon, the countdown 1962.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; So if a man sets on the thought of
[1:26:23] justifications all you have to have,
[1:26:26] he's wrong.
[1:26:28] He's got to be wrong. Then if the church
[1:26:30] who believes like the many of
[1:26:32] Pentecostals that the Holy Ghost is it,
[1:26:35] that's all. Just repent and get the Holy
[1:26:37] Ghost, that's still wrong
[1:26:41] because you've got to get sanctification
[1:26:43] in there to cleanse it before the Holy
[1:26:46] Ghost comes in. If you don't, you leave
[1:26:48] out the blood. See, the new birth as
[1:26:52] people talks about the baptism of the
[1:26:54] Holy Ghost is the new birth. Now, that's
[1:26:57] wrong.
[1:26:59] Now, there are many ministers within the
[1:27:02] message that haven't got this doctrally
[1:27:05] correct.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Let him define what is the new birth.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:13] different from the new birth.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; The new birth is when you're born again.
[1:27:19] But the Holy Ghost
[1:27:22] is when power comes in to that birth for
[1:27:25] service. That's exact
[1:27:28] the new birth. You have the new birth by
[1:27:31] being believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:27:33] Christ. See, by having faith and
[1:27:36] accepting him as your savior, that's
[1:27:38] birth because you pass from death unto
[1:27:41] life. And he quotes St. John 5:24.
[1:27:45] He that hearth my words. That same group
[1:27:48] had to go to Pentecost to be baptized
[1:27:50] with the Holy Ghost. I want to ask you,
[1:27:52] the disciples for three years, three and
[1:27:55] a half years, were they born again?
[1:27:58] Absolutely. But he says, "I want you to
[1:28:01] go to Jerusalem and tarry until you're
[1:28:03] endued with power."
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; They'd been casting out devils,
[1:28:08] preaching the gospel, signs and wonders
[1:28:10] following, and did it without the Holy
[1:28:12] Ghost.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:28:17] So when you talk like you got the to be
[1:28:20] born again and applying that to the Holy
[1:28:22] Ghost, many of the Methodists and so
[1:28:24] forth are wrong there. It cannot it
[1:28:27] won't cope with the scripture here. You
[1:28:29] get things sideways.
[1:28:32] They got to take it the way the
[1:28:33] scriptures got it placed out there. And
[1:28:35] it goes on and they already believe to
[1:28:38] eternal life and so forth, but they had
[1:28:40] to have the Holy Ghost for power.
[1:28:45] You shall be witnesses unto me after the
[1:28:47] Holy Ghost has come upon you because the
[1:28:48] Holy Ghost is a witness of the
[1:28:50] resurrection showing that you have
[1:28:53] become an adult in Christ.
[1:28:57] You're an adult. Now, here's the
[1:28:59] question that they asked Brother
[1:29:01] Brennham
[1:29:02] concerning the condition of those who do
[1:29:04] not get the Holy Ghost. They're just
[1:29:06] born again.
[1:29:09] Are they going to go in the rapture?
[1:29:12] What's the difference between salvation
[1:29:14] and being sealed? They're saved but not
[1:29:18] sealed.
[1:29:21] Questions and answers here on the image
[1:29:23] of the beast 1954. If a person dies
[1:29:26] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:29:28] will they be lost?
[1:29:32] No sir. If he's a believer, he'll come
[1:29:35] up in the resurrection.
[1:29:37] Second resurrection.
[1:29:41] If he's got the baptism, he'll go in the
[1:29:43] first resurrection.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; This is it. Now, I don't want you to
[1:29:49] just be moved on by the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Okay? I don't want you to just have
[1:29:55] spiritual experiences with God like
[1:29:58] Jacob and it never changed him. They
[1:30:00] were Bethl experiences. Nothing wrong
[1:30:03] with Bethl experiences. You can see
[1:30:05] angels. You can see a ladder ascending
[1:30:08] and descending up into heaven and angels
[1:30:11] descending upon it. You can have all
[1:30:13] kinds of spiritual things happening. But
[1:30:16] Jacob was never changed.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; So Bethl experiences are good, but don't
[1:30:21] let that be your basis
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; of saying that you're saved.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Go on further.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Let's keep going.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; You're born children.
[1:30:35] You grow into adults
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; and then you're tested on what you
[1:30:40] believe.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:47] So, the church is moved on by the Holy
[1:30:50] Ghost.
[1:30:52] Again, like I said, be experiences are
[1:30:54] fine. That's great. I don't uh I say we
[1:30:57] we've all had those. Billy Paul said, "I
[1:30:59] saw the angel in person. It never kept
[1:31:02] me from going into sin." Justification,
[1:31:05] listen to this, is an act of the Holy
[1:31:08] Spirit. Taking the cup, picking it up.
[1:31:12] Okay? And then sanctification.
[1:31:17] See, justification is picking it up.
[1:31:19] Sanctification is cleansing. Set aside
[1:31:22] for service.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost baptism is putting it
[1:31:26] into service.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together on that?
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, justification is an act of the
[1:31:32] Holy Ghost. Sanctification is an act of
[1:31:35] the Holy Ghost. But the baptism of the
[1:31:38] Holy Ghost is also a work of the Holy
[1:31:42] Spirit
[1:31:44] quickening that seed within you and
[1:31:46] giving you the breath of life. And now
[1:31:48] you are born again.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Without the breath of life, without the
[1:31:53] quickening of the Holy Spirit, Brother
[1:31:56] Bren said, you're still born.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Wow. You got to have that posterior
[1:32:02] protoplasm. Whack.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; That's the new birth.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Water blood spirit.
[1:32:13] Justification, sanctification,
[1:32:16] holy spirit coming down, germatizing
[1:32:18] that seed goes into the heart,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; comes from the hearing gate.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; He that heareth my words goes through
[1:32:26] the the ear gate into the mind, womb,
[1:32:29] and the spirit. And as long as you don't
[1:32:30] abort and say, "I don't believe it." It
[1:32:32] goes into the heart, pregnant seed, and
[1:32:35] guess what? Now you're born again.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. But you're a
[1:32:39] baby.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; So now you got to learn.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; So
[1:32:44] in the third seal, Brother Bram picks
[1:32:46] this up. 1963.
[1:32:48] If the Pentecostal message was the last
[1:32:51] message, which justification,
[1:32:53] sanctification, and baptism of the Holy
[1:32:56] Ghost, the last three messages, the last
[1:32:58] three church ages forms the complete
[1:33:02] birth.
[1:33:03] Wow. Wesley, Luther, and Pentecost. What
[1:33:07] does it do? It completes the new birth.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; But there's something even after that.
[1:33:13] What is it?
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; The word made way for the word himself.
[1:33:19] The Holy Ghost makes way for the Holy
[1:33:21] Ghost. And then you have a complete word
[1:33:24] birth.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because every seed has got
[1:33:28] to bring forth of its own kind. If it's
[1:33:31] denominational
[1:33:33] teaching, it brings forth denominational
[1:33:35] people.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; But if it's original seed,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; if it's original seed, it will bring
[1:33:43] forth of the original kind. Amen.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; You don't have to baby them.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; They're not hot house plants.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; You tell them the truth.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; You're not tucked into it. You're not
[1:33:57] coaxed into it. You're not babyed into
[1:33:59] it.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Listen, I say unto every one of you,
[1:34:02] become men.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Become women.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Mature adults.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; The church. Listen, the church, every
[1:34:17] one of them in the church is born again.
[1:34:24] They're all firstborn sons and
[1:34:25] daughters. They all have eternal life.
[1:34:28] As long as they do not reject the word
[1:34:30] because there are some that say they're
[1:34:33] born again and then they come up to the
[1:34:35] fact that they reject the word, they
[1:34:37] couldn't have had the word
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; because you can't reject it. If you're
[1:34:42] begotten of the word, you say amen to
[1:34:43] the word that begot you.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:34:50] they may not live it. Church,
[1:34:54] foolish virgin may not live it, but they
[1:34:58] don't reject it.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; How many of you know of believers within
[1:35:03] the message that are not living the
[1:35:05] message,
[1:35:06] and they just say, "Well, I believe it.
[1:35:09] I don't come against Brother Brendom.
[1:35:10] don't come against the message of the
[1:35:12] hour. I believe it. I just can't live
[1:35:15] it.
[1:35:16] So foolish virgin,
[1:35:19] okay, comes to the place where they they
[1:35:23] have eternal life. I'm going to show you
[1:35:25] from the scripture and from the message.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Now, all of them will be redeemed.
[1:35:33] They're going to be saved.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; They're going to be in heaven.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; But they're not part of the bride.
[1:35:39] They're not in the new Jerusalem. That's
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Listen, if we're going to run, we want
[1:35:43] to run to gain the prize.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; If you're going to want to get raptured
[1:35:48] out of this age, you have to press into
[1:35:53] rapturing faith.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Or you just going to sit there and say,
[1:36:00] "Well, I can't I don't believe it all. I
[1:36:02] just don't reject it." And you know, no.
[1:36:05] Come into it.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:08] Foolish virgin, understand this, will be
[1:36:11] saved. They have eternal life. They do
[1:36:15] not get eternal life at the white
[1:36:18] throne.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; They were sheep
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; and there were goats
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; and there's a separation. Why do they
[1:36:32] come at white throne judgment? Because
[1:36:34] they were foolish. Yeah.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; The bride receives her judgment now
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; because
[1:36:41] judgment begins at the house of God.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; So we come here to judge ourselves. This
[1:36:47] is the only judgment. Hallelujah. The
[1:36:50] bride received. It's now. And it's self
[1:36:53] judgment. Judge yourselves.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[1:37:02] But foolish
[1:37:04] hears it but doesn't heed it.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Now in then Jesus came 1957.
[1:37:13] When you come here and bow your heads
[1:37:15] and you surrender to God and repent of
[1:37:17] your sins, you're born again. You're a
[1:37:20] candidate then to be baptized into the
[1:37:22] church by the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:25] You're born again. Then you're a
[1:37:26] candidate.
[1:37:28] You see that? Into the body of Christ.
[1:37:30] You become a believer. You're born again
[1:37:32] when you believe. He talks about he that
[1:37:35] believeth my words. Then God gives you
[1:37:38] the next which is the baptism of the
[1:37:40] Holy Ghost.
[1:37:45] He goes on again in Hebrews series. When
[1:37:47] you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:37:49] then you have the new birth. When you
[1:37:51] believe on the Lord, you receive a new
[1:37:53] thought, a new life. But it isn't the
[1:37:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost. You've got
[1:37:58] the new birth. When you believe, you've
[1:38:00] got eternal life.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; When you believe, you've got eternal
[1:38:08] life.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; It's a gift of God.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; That's the new birth. You're converted
[1:38:14] means you're turned around. But the
[1:38:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost puts you into
[1:38:18] the body of Christ, subject to the gifts
[1:38:21] for service. Subject to the gifts.
[1:38:24] Foolish virgin don't come subject to
[1:38:26] nothing. Right.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Do you see?
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make you any more of a
[1:38:36] Christian.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:38:41] You mean the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:43] doesn't make you any more of a
[1:38:44] Christian? No. You got eternal life.
[1:38:46] What does it do? It put you subject to
[1:38:48] the gifts. Amen.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I go to church because I'm
[1:38:52] supposed to." Submit yourselves under
[1:38:56] the authority of those that God has
[1:38:58] placed over you whose faith following
[1:39:01] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:39:04] today, and forever. That's why you do
[1:39:06] what you do.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; You come subject. Otherwise, Willy's
[1:39:11] virgin. I ain't coming subject to
[1:39:13] nobody. I don't have to go to church. I
[1:39:15] don't have to have a pastor. I don't
[1:39:17] have to pay my tithe. I can do what I
[1:39:19] want.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Doesn't make you any more of a
[1:39:28] Christian. He continues on Hebrews
[1:39:31] paragraph 270. But as far as having
[1:39:34] eternal life and being a Christian,
[1:39:36] you're a Christian the moment you
[1:39:37] believe. Now that that uh that's not
[1:39:40] make believe, it's truly believe on the
[1:39:42] Lord Jesus and accept him as your
[1:39:44] personal savior. You're born again right
[1:39:46] there. Have eternal life. God comes into
[1:39:49] you.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Wow. A new creature in Christ. But I
[1:39:55] want to ask you, how are you doing on
[1:39:57] your walk with God in growing up to be a
[1:39:59] mature Christian?
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; He goes on, have you received the Holy
[1:40:03] Ghost since you believe? Now, when you
[1:40:05] believe, you got eternal life. That's
[1:40:07] the new birth. That's your conversion
[1:40:09] changing. But the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:11] Spirit is the power of God. and you're
[1:40:14] baptized into and are subject to those
[1:40:16] nine spiritual gifts. What are those
[1:40:18] gifts? He mentions a few. Preaching,
[1:40:21] evangelist, apostles, pastors, prophets,
[1:40:24] so on and so forth. Don't make you any
[1:40:27] more of a Christian. It just sets you
[1:40:30] positionally in a place to be a man of
[1:40:32] uh be a ministering spirit in the church
[1:40:34] of the living God.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] Then he goes on and listen, I don't want
[1:40:40] to bog you down with just quotes,
[1:40:47] but the reason I show you these quotes
[1:40:49] is
[1:40:51] what does brother Brennham teach about
[1:40:53] the new birth?
[1:40:58] What does he teach about adoption? What
[1:41:00] does he talk teach about the four living
[1:41:04] creatures?
[1:41:06] What does he talk about the four
[1:41:09] antichrist spirits?
[1:41:12] The red horse, the white horse, so on
[1:41:14] and so forth. And he says, "And there's
[1:41:17] four spirits that combat that.
[1:41:20] The lion, the ox, the man, and the
[1:41:22] eagle.
[1:41:23] These are anointings." You understand
[1:41:26] that? Okay. So, he says the last three
[1:41:29] ages, Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, brought
[1:41:32] forth a new birth. But he said that
[1:41:34] makes way for the word itself.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you realize that this
[1:41:39] messenger
[1:41:40] brought to us back the full truth of the
[1:41:43] word?
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That completed a a word
[1:41:47] birth.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram says in adoption. How
[1:41:54] many knows the rules of adoption in the
[1:41:56] Old Testament? Now in the Old Testament
[1:41:58] when a child was born into a family, he
[1:42:00] was a child when he was born because he
[1:42:02] was born of his parents. He's a son of
[1:42:04] the family and heir to all things.
[1:42:07] Then after being born, we are
[1:42:10] predestinated unto adoption to be placed
[1:42:12] into the body of Christ. He goes on on
[1:42:15] paragraph 151, after you're adopted, all
[1:42:18] right, after you're adopted, you're
[1:42:20] placed.
[1:42:22] Then you understand after the ceremony
[1:42:24] said that you've been put into the body
[1:42:26] correctly. You're a son. Sure. A
[1:42:28] daughter. When you're born again, that's
[1:42:31] your birth. But now you're positionally
[1:42:34] placed.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then you be understand that
[1:42:38] this adoption. We have been
[1:42:42] called unto adoption.
[1:42:45] Not just a birth.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Not just saying, "Well, I I go to
[1:42:49] church. That's it. that that that's all.
[1:42:52] I've been born again. That's it.
[1:42:55] And we've made it in the message
[1:42:58] teachings that the new birth is all you
[1:43:00] got. How many of you believe that God
[1:43:03] sent a prophet? Amen. God bless you. How
[1:43:04] many of you believe you've been born
[1:43:06] again? Praise God. You've been baptized.
[1:43:08] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. You made
[1:43:10] it. That's it. Then I want to ask you,
[1:43:13] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:43:14] you believe?
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Why are people
[1:43:17] so tossed about? Why are there so many
[1:43:19] ups and downs? Because they haven't been
[1:43:20] taught correctly.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Listen. If the prize for this age is to
[1:43:28] go into rapture.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; If you're going to run,
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; hey, listen. I don't want second place
[1:43:35] because second place
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; gives you tribulation.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; I want a way out of here.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to strive to enter
[1:43:42] in.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to gain that prize.
[1:43:46] What is it? The token. Without the
[1:43:49] token, you ain't going.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; So, if some minister can water it down,
[1:43:54] hybrid it down,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; soft soap it so much and just say,
[1:43:58] "Well, you're a member of the church,
[1:43:59] you're born again, that's it. You got
[1:44:01] it." He's watering the word.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; The token.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Do not cheapen,
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; the token of this hour
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; by just saying, "Well, you believe you
[1:44:16] got it.
[1:44:18] That's a deceiver.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; The church will be saved. I'm showing
[1:44:30] you.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; She's not sealed.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; They have eternal life.
[1:44:39] Saved
[1:44:41] but not sealed.
[1:44:43] Had he writes, "Boys,
[1:44:46] what are you asking?" Had he right? The
[1:44:48] salvation
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; of my two boys. Thus sayaith the Lord. I
[1:44:53] give you your two boys. They came in
[1:44:54] crying, weeping. Where are they today?
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Are they bride?
[1:45:00] Do they go to church?
[1:45:03] Listen, when you begin to to look at all
[1:45:05] this stuff, and I'm not judging that.
[1:45:07] All I'm saying is, hey, listen. I
[1:45:09] believe they're saved. Why? The prophet
[1:45:11] said, thus sayith the Lord.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; She asked for the salvation.
[1:45:15] They came right there, gave their heart
[1:45:17] to God and and guess what? They got
[1:45:19] eternal life.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Are they bride? Nope. Can't be.
[1:45:23] Otherwise, they'll be doing what the
[1:45:24] bride would be doing.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Being full obedience
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; to the word of God and ties you to the
[1:45:31] token.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Saved but not sealed. Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus also gives an explanation in
[1:45:44] Matthew 7. He said, "Not many of those
[1:45:47] that say unto me, Lord, Lord,
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; shall enter into the kingdom of heaven."
[1:45:53] And he but he that doeth the will of my
[1:45:55] father which is in heaven. Many will say
[1:45:58] unto me that day, Lord, have not we
[1:46:01] prophesied in thy name,
[1:46:04] and in thy name cast out devils,
[1:46:07] and in thy name done many wonderful
[1:46:10] works.
[1:46:11] All of this in the name of Jesus. How
[1:46:14] many know there's power in the name?
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; I see I see ministers.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; I see them saying in the name of Jesus.
[1:46:23] In the name of Jesus, that powerful
[1:46:26] name, in the name of Jesus, I jer thee,
[1:46:28] Satan, by the name of Jesus. How many
[1:46:32] realize that the seven sons ofKea
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; were doing exactly the same thing?
[1:46:38] Thought they had a deliverance ministry
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; and they come and guess what? Paul, I
[1:46:44] know, and Jesus we know, but who are
[1:46:46] you?
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; They were trying to cast out in the name
[1:46:51] of Jesus.
[1:46:53] God deliver us from some of these that
[1:46:56] call themselves deliverance ministries.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "You go to lay
[1:47:06] hands on somebody that's been living a
[1:47:09] life contrary to the word."
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; And he said, "You want to cast that
[1:47:12] devil off them?" And he says, "And they
[1:47:14] have not repented."
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the conviction come on
[1:47:19] their heart and they repented." He says,
[1:47:21] "You know what you can do? You can
[1:47:22] anoint them with oil all you want? You
[1:47:24] can scream over them the name of Jesus
[1:47:27] and that devil's got a right to stay
[1:47:29] right there." That's why so much of the
[1:47:31] time we see our youth our youth are
[1:47:33] being confused right now because they go
[1:47:35] to campaign after campaign, meeting
[1:47:37] after meeting, and and we think that the
[1:47:40] the the the problem solver is to have a
[1:47:43] prayer line.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; No, I tell you, you know what you need
[1:47:46] to do? Preach a word that'll bring a
[1:47:48] conviction. Repent or perish. Stop what
[1:47:52] you're doing. Don't just come up here.
[1:47:54] Don't think I injure thee in the name of
[1:47:57] Jesus.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; And go out and a week later they're
[1:48:03] worse than they was when they before.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; No wonder they're confused. No wonder
[1:48:09] they're saying there's nothing to this
[1:48:11] message.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Because they've been told by somebody
[1:48:15] that's it. Just come up here. And maybe
[1:48:18] the spirit left for a week or two.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Maybe they felt pretty good.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Then depression and
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; all of this stuff. And oh, they go back
[1:48:27] into Jesus said, "Go and sin no more,
[1:48:31] lest the
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; lest the worst thing come upon you."
[1:48:45] Questions answers 1961.
[1:48:49] Brother Brennham, what happens to the
[1:48:50] people
[1:48:52] who are the con considered the sleeping
[1:48:54] virgin when they are judged at the
[1:48:57] judgment?
[1:48:58] Sleeping virgin. What happens to them?
[1:49:01] The sleeping virgin will be saved, of
[1:49:04] course.
[1:49:09] They're saved. Do they have salvation?
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Saved but not sealed. Watch this. Now,
[1:49:16] she'll never be the bride.
[1:49:19] But she is a saved group of people that
[1:49:21] come in the judgment that will not be
[1:49:24] included in the bride. As long as they
[1:49:27] are virgins, they are before God. They
[1:49:30] are to be saved.
[1:49:32] They'll be the sheep on the right side
[1:49:35] and the unsaved will be the goats on the
[1:49:37] left side of the great white throne
[1:49:38] judgment.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; But guess what? They're going to be
[1:49:42] judged.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Tribulation judges them.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; You either judge yourself now or you be
[1:49:52] foolish and you'll be judged.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; And guess what? the spirit of hatred and
[1:49:57] violence.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; He said that little hunted, persecuted
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; little remnant that's left over after
[1:50:03] the bride is gone.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; You better get some gumption and stand
[1:50:07] up for what's right now.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Because otherwise, you're going to have
[1:50:12] to give your life because you know what?
[1:50:13] Without the shedding of blood,
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; understand this. Let me give you a
[1:50:19] doctrinal teaching.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; When the day of grace for the Gentiles
[1:50:23] is over,
[1:50:26] And he said there'll not be another
[1:50:28] Gentile saved.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together on that?
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; He says right now, he said Christ, the
[1:50:35] body of Jesus Christ sits on the altar
[1:50:37] of sacrifice before the throne. And he
[1:50:41] says, "But at that time," he says, "the
[1:50:44] spirit of God will enter back into and
[1:50:47] put on,
[1:50:51] take off the body from off of the altar
[1:50:53] of sacrifice
[1:50:56] and we'll put on the body to come back
[1:50:59] down." Do you understand it? So now
[1:51:02] there's no more sacrifice.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; So if God requires blood,
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; where does the foolish virgin
[1:51:11] If you don't come under his blood,
[1:51:13] you'll have to come under your own blood
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; and seal your own testimony
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; with your own blood.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this hatred and violence
[1:51:24] that we see coming up right now.
[1:51:27] when that spirit of antichrist
[1:51:31] which is a religious system that if you
[1:51:33] don't agree with it or whatever at the
[1:51:36] end time when the if you don't accept
[1:51:39] the mark of the beast
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; and you don't agree with this system
[1:51:44] they'll hate you they'll kill you
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; right
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; this hatred and violence that you see
[1:51:52] right now
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; in its embryionic form
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; it's just starting But when that pale
[1:51:59] horse rider when he begins to ride death
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; and hell follow him
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; you think it's bad now.
[1:52:10] Brother Brenham said they'll be
[1:52:11] ministers. He said go to pray for
[1:52:13] somebody. They'll be shot in the street.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; These people that are your neighbors
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; that are kind and sweet. Little Joe and
[1:52:26] Linda.
[1:52:31] You understand? See, listen. The day of
[1:52:34] debate and all of this stuff, you you
[1:52:37] can debate. You can go down to the
[1:52:40] street corners and God bless those that
[1:52:42] want to go and debate with those and
[1:52:45] say, "Prove me wrong."
[1:52:49] God bless Charlie Kirk for what he stood
[1:52:53] for. Amen.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; But there was nobody being changed.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; What he did was he showed, I'm not
[1:53:02] ashamed of what I believe, and I'll
[1:53:04] stand here and I'll use the word of God.
[1:53:06] And one thing that was good about him
[1:53:08] was he wasn't losing his cool.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I could do it,
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; honestly. Oh,
[1:53:18] yeah. Well, come here.
[1:53:22] I believe on the laying on of hands
[1:53:27] because you know what? Listen, if any of
[1:53:29] you have ever been in a debate debate
[1:53:32] with somebody and they get in your face
[1:53:34] and they get mad and they get angry,
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; huh?
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; It's not nice.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; I've never seen in a debate that
[1:53:42] somebody on the other side is convinced.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; What it is is two opposing forces. I
[1:53:48] want you to understand that the forces
[1:53:50] of evil and of darkness are against the
[1:53:52] forces of light. And it's coming to a
[1:53:55] conflict.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; It's happening. The contest is on.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; You're in the midst of it. Now, do you
[1:54:01] see the worst of all ages?
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; God bless those who want to go out and
[1:54:09] debate with him. I don't. I'm sorry.
[1:54:16] I want to preach the gospel.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Questions answers 1963.
[1:54:29] This is questions answers on the seals.
[1:54:32] What happened to born again believers
[1:54:35] who are in the various denominations
[1:54:42] but not in the bride of Christ?
[1:54:45] What happens to them? Now, brother
[1:54:48] Brandham said there are born again
[1:54:50] believers in all denominations.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; I believe Charlie Kirk was one of them.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Do I doubt that he's going to be there?
[1:54:58] No, I don't.
[1:55:03] I believe he'll be there. It's born
[1:55:04] again.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Stood for Christ.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; They go into the tribulation.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; What happens to those who don't go into
[1:55:16] bride? They go into tribulation.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; They are martyed
[1:55:21] in the tribulation.
[1:55:27] They come up in the last after the
[1:55:29] millennium for their judgment.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; See, because the Bible said that the
[1:55:34] rest of the living, the rest of the dead
[1:55:36] live not again for a thousand years.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; He came to the earth when 10,000 times
[1:55:43] 10,000 of his saints. Is that right? His
[1:55:45] bride judgment was set and the books
[1:55:47] were open and another was book was open
[1:55:50] which is the book of life.
[1:55:53] He separated them from the goats, from
[1:55:55] the sheep. Is that right? They had
[1:55:57] nothing to do with the bride. She's
[1:55:59] standing right there in judgment with
[1:56:02] her queen and the king and queen
[1:56:05] together.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; They are saved but not sealed.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; You know Abraham, there are examples of
[1:56:16] this throughout scripture. Abraham and
[1:56:18] Lot. Brother Bram said Abraham elected
[1:56:20] Lot.
[1:56:22] nominational believer,
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; a nominal believer.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Do you know Lot was akin to Abraham?
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Blood relation.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Lot chooses to live in Sodom.
[1:56:41] His righteous soul is vexed daily by the
[1:56:44] things that surrounds him. and Lot's
[1:56:46] daughters even to the point of get him
[1:56:48] drunk
[1:56:50] because they believe well there is no
[1:56:53] man to give a seed. So they get their
[1:56:55] father Lot drunk and they have an
[1:56:57] incestuous relationship with Lot. And
[1:57:00] the Bible says in Genesis 19, watch
[1:57:03] this. And they made their father drink
[1:57:07] wine that night also. And the younger
[1:57:08] arose and lay with him and perceived not
[1:57:11] when she lay down nor when she arose.
[1:57:14] They were both the daughters of Lot with
[1:57:16] child by their father.
[1:57:19] And the firstborn bear a son, and called
[1:57:22] his name Moab,
[1:57:24] and the same as the father of the
[1:57:26] Moabites unto this day.
[1:57:29] And the younger also bare a son, and
[1:57:32] called his name Benami,
[1:57:35] the same as the father of the children
[1:57:37] of Amnan unto this day. Now, stop here
[1:57:40] for just a moment
[1:57:42] because our our brother Warren Argizola
[1:57:45] preached Wednesday night and it was it
[1:57:48] was tremendous.
[1:57:50] And he says, "Now the Moabites and the
[1:57:52] Ammonites shall not enter the kingdom of
[1:57:55] God for 10 generations, 400 years, they
[1:57:59] cannot enter in."
[1:58:01] And he turns right around and said,
[1:58:03] "Ruth, who is a
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Moabitis,
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what happened?"
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Did God change his mind?
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Did he break his word?
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; And there'll not be a Moabitete enter
[1:58:18] into the congregation of the children of
[1:58:21] God for 400 years.
[1:58:25] So what changed Ruth from a curse
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; to a blessing?
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; She said, "Your God,
[1:58:35] [Applause]
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; your God will be my God, and your people
[1:58:41] will be my people." There was a union
[1:58:44] taking place.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; She joined herself to the Old Testament
[1:58:49] covenant of Abraham's seed. And I shall
[1:58:55] [Applause]
[1:58:56] I will give unto the seed of Abraham an
[1:58:59] unconditional
[1:59:01] covenant.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; She joined herself to Naomi.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Where you go, I go.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; What message you believe, I believe.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; You see, and so she she's got this unit.
[1:59:16] So now Naomi has got a
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; kinsman.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Because of her husband.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; She comes back.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; She tells Orpa and Ruth, "You guys go
[1:59:30] off." Orpa goes back to the world.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Ruth decides.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; She's now joined to Naomi.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Naomi says, "I'm going back. I'm cursed.
[1:59:46] I'm cursed.
[1:59:48] Look at my life. It's nothing left. I'm
[1:59:51] going back. And she goes back to the
[1:59:53] land of promise.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; And when she's there, she finds out
[1:59:57] there's a kinsman.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; I have a nearer kinsman.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; And he shall do the work. And now Ruth,
[2:00:05] I want you to understand who was a
[2:00:07] Moabitete.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Who was under the curse?
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, the covenant is
[2:00:13] greater than the curse. Amen.
[2:00:19] [Applause]
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Grace is greater than the law.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; She came under that grace covenant.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; She came under the promise of the
[2:00:31] covenant. I will watch over your seed
[2:00:34] and a seed after you to as many as the
[2:00:37] Lord God calls.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And now by her union to
[2:00:44] Naomi,
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; she has a right
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; to even glean in the fields of Boaz.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; And while she's gleaning, Boaz falls in
[2:00:54] love with her.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; A Moabit is
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; God saw virtue
[2:01:10] before cleansing.
[2:01:14] while we were yet sinners.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Christ died.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; When she joined herself to Naomi, she
[2:01:29] comes under a covenant
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; because of a union.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that what God
[2:01:35] has done in this age,
[2:01:37] he's brought to you. Amen. You are seed
[2:01:41] of Abraham
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; and there's been an Melzdc
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; that has come down and met
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; with Abraham
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; in the cool of the evening. Do you
[2:01:54] understand? Oh my brother, my sister.
[2:01:57] And so what's happened? You've come
[2:01:59] under the same covenant.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Who is this Melazedc?
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; What is this attraction?
[2:02:06] What is this that you call the message
[2:02:08] of the hour?
[2:02:12] I'll tell you what it is.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; It's a union.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; It's a uniting.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; It's a coming together.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Alpha and Omega coming back together.
[2:02:24] Husband and wife.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Then the two shall become one.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; And they're no longer of two different
[2:02:32] but one flesh. Amen.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; And when you're in Christ, you are
[2:02:37] neither male nor female, Jew nor
[2:02:41] Gentile, bond nor free.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; But you've been come under the covenant
[2:02:46] of he that made the covenant.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 7, let me try to bring
[2:02:59] this to a close here. And Lot went down
[2:03:02] and had backslid.
[2:03:05] Though he was a Hebrew,
[2:03:10] he went down and backslid. Let me say
[2:03:12] this.
[2:03:15] There are some that have backslid
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; that are real Hebrews.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; And don't count them out
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; because it ain't over till it's over.
[2:03:28] There might be the last minute and all
[2:03:30] of a sudden they repent. Oh God, I
[2:03:32] repent.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, I've got a son
[2:03:38] that is wewarded
[2:03:40] and I told him, I said, "I do not. I'm
[2:03:42] not here to preach to you. You know the
[2:03:45] sermons.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; You've been raised right.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; But I said, I am the father of a
[2:03:51] prodigal
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; who's going out and eats with the pigs.
[2:03:58] But I said,
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; I stand at the door.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; I wait for the turning.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at the present.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Don't you count somebody out.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; It ain't over till it's over.
[2:04:21] I said, "And and and son, when you
[2:04:24] turn," I said, "I'm going to throw a
[2:04:26] party."
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; I said, "I will rejoice. I will give you
[2:04:31] the ring. I'll give you the signal, and
[2:04:32] I'll give you the robe. I will just
[2:04:34] rejoice."
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; How dare we look down our nose?
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; It ain't over
[2:04:47] till it's over. Yes.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Do I condone
[2:04:51] the way they live? No, I don't.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; I can love the sinner and hate the sin.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; It just takes a moment.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; It just takes a moment.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; And when God convicts their heart and
[2:05:11] they turn
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Are we going to look down at
[2:05:16] somebody if the And let me tell you
[2:05:18] what's happening right now.
[2:05:22] The prodigals are coming in.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; People are turning.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Some who have been away from the message
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; are coming back.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So we any of you got a
[2:05:43] friend, a loved one, a brother, a
[2:05:45] sister, husband, wife, daughter, son
[2:05:48] that's not living right? Maybe, you
[2:05:50] know, maybe they got offended. Maybe
[2:05:52] somebody did something and ah I tell you
[2:05:54] what, if that's a bride, I don't want a
[2:05:56] part of it and somebody offended them.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible says offenses must come.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; But woe unto them
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; that bring the offense. Amen.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amazing thing is most of the people that
[2:06:10] have been offended have also been one
[2:06:13] that offended somebody else,
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; but they only see what was done to them.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Don't let me offend anyone.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brennham, let me continue
[2:06:30] on here. Lot was saved. Don't ever think
[2:06:32] that Lot wasn't saved. He was because
[2:06:37] all the time when he was in the wrong
[2:06:40] place,
[2:06:42] Lot went in the wrong down in Sodom.
[2:06:45] Poor old guy, righteous seed in the
[2:06:48] wrong place
[2:06:50] and and his soul was vexed daily
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; because he was down in Sodom.
[2:06:59] The Bible said the sins of Sodom vexed
[2:07:01] his righteous soul daily. See, Abraham a
[2:07:04] type of the elect seed. He did not go
[2:07:07] down to Sodom.
[2:07:09] No, but he stood in the gap for Lot.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; I think we ought to stand in the gap for
[2:07:14] others and say, "God, bring them in."
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; We cut people off.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Don't cut them off.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Now, questions and answers. musicians
[2:07:29] have become I'm I'm bringing this to a
[2:07:31] club.
[2:07:33] The nominal believers like Lot,
[2:07:36] he's going through the tribulation
[2:07:38] period.
[2:07:39] Oh my,
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; poor Lot.
[2:07:44] Poor Lot.
[2:07:48] He's going through the tribulation
[2:07:53] and be saved as it was by fire. Noah
[2:07:57] went through the tribulation period
[2:07:58] carried above it come out with Ham who
[2:08:01] polluted the earth again. Lot come out
[2:08:03] his own daughters slept with him and he
[2:08:05] had children by his own daughters. But
[2:08:07] Abraham brought forth the royalty.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; The seed of promise. Enoch went to glory
[2:08:16] in the rapture. Just took a walk and
[2:08:18] went home. He never went through the
[2:08:20] tribulation period.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; See the church will go through the
[2:08:24] tribulation period. You see the
[2:08:26] difference between church and bride.
[2:08:28] Amen.
[2:08:32] Hebrews 11:5, "By faith Enoch was
[2:08:34] translated
[2:08:36] that he should not see death
[2:08:40] and he was not found
[2:08:44] because God had translated him."
[2:08:48] And before his translation,
[2:08:53] he had this testimony
[2:08:56] that he pleased God because without
[2:08:59] faith,
[2:09:01] it's impossible
[2:09:04] to please God.
[2:09:06] So I believe what's happening right now,
[2:09:10] God is dealing
[2:09:12] with the type of Enoch right now.
[2:09:15] You're having the fa translating you,
[2:09:20] bringing you from one glory to another
[2:09:22] glory. The power of transformation.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Transforming you,
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; changing you. Oh, you listen.
[2:09:33] We're not going to have the fullness of
[2:09:36] our redemption until the rapture.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; And then in a moment, in a twinkling of
[2:09:41] an eye, we shall all be changed.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Until that time, I
[2:09:49] deal with this flesh.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; I deal with carnal natures.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; But I've got something inside of me
[2:10:00] that's changing me.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; It's transforming me.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Remember now, a foolish virgin is the
[2:10:10] church.
[2:10:13] And out of the church,
[2:10:15] he calls a bride.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Let's not just say, "Well, praise God.
[2:10:21] I'm in that church."
[2:10:23] Make your calling
[2:10:26] and your election. Sure.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just say, "Well, I'm
[2:10:32] I'm glad that I'm called."
[2:10:36] No, I want to go to election. The
[2:10:38] majority of the believers today within
[2:10:41] the message
[2:10:44] are church.
[2:10:49] You can look and see they're becoming
[2:10:51] more foolish.
[2:10:55] Instead of closer to God, they're more
[2:10:58] lukewarm.
[2:11:00] Instead of being more obedient to the
[2:11:02] word, we see their lukewarmness. We see
[2:11:04] the fashion of the world. We see the
[2:11:06] sisters battling it. the brothers with
[2:11:09] their haircuts
[2:11:11] and growing their hair stylish like the
[2:11:15] perverts of this world. And you got your
[2:11:18] baggy pants or you got your skin down
[2:11:21] wiener pants.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah, sisters, you could say amen.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Because we're on your case enough. What
[2:11:30] about them?
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:34] You young boys,
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; let me tell you. You don't think I I
[2:11:39] don't see you with the way you dress and
[2:11:42] your baggy pants and everything. Don't
[2:11:45] be foolish.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; If I could provoke you unto good works,
[2:11:49] I would.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; But if I if I force
[2:11:56] a law upon them, they get resentful.
[2:12:00] I tell you what, you take off them Becky
[2:12:01] pants, you cut that hair, you do this
[2:12:04] and that, they'll have the same spirit I
[2:12:07] had before he got converted. You cut my
[2:12:09] hair, I'll kill you.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; So what you do?
[2:12:19] When I came into this message, I had
[2:12:21] long hair
[2:12:26] and I wasn't going to let nobody cut it.
[2:12:28] I told my dad, "You forced me all these
[2:12:31] years to cut my hair. I'm gonna walk on
[2:12:33] it before I cut it.
[2:12:36] Don't you come around my house, you
[2:12:38] pervert." I said, "That's fine."
[2:12:42] Six, eight months later, come Christmas,
[2:12:44] my dad called me up. Are you coming
[2:12:45] home? No, I got long hair.
[2:12:48] Yeah, son. It come home anyway. I got
[2:12:51] long hair, Dad.
[2:12:56] My dad wasn't a Christian. You know what
[2:12:59] my dad said? I love you anyways.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:13:07] Dad, you love me anyways.
[2:13:10] Okay, I'll be there.
[2:13:16] Can you love the sinner and hate the
[2:13:18] sin?
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:29] Philippians 3 and13.
[2:13:32] Brethren, I count not myself
[2:13:35] to have
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; apprehend,
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; but this one thing I do,
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; forgetting those things which are
[2:13:44] behind,
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; and reaching forth under those things
[2:13:49] which
[2:13:50] are before, I press towards the mark.
[2:13:53] Amen.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Of the prize of the high calling of God
[2:13:57] in Christ Jesus.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Let us therefore as many as be perfect
[2:14:04] be thus minded.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Lord help me to be thus minded.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; How can you tell foolish from wise?
[2:14:13] Watch their life.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Look at the fruits.
[2:14:17] If they say they believe the message and
[2:14:19] they don't follow the word of God,
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; they're foolish.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; They honorth God with their lips, but
[2:14:28] their heart is far from him. In vain do
[2:14:32] they worship God.
[2:14:34] Amen. I want to be a true believer.
[2:14:36] Don't you?
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; I want to be that elect seed. I want to
[2:14:40] be like Enoch. I want to be like
[2:14:42] Abraham. I want to be like those of old
[2:14:45] that press towards the mark of the high
[2:14:47] calling through this dark and dying age.
[2:14:51] I tell you, if if the world right now,
[2:14:54] if they're over there, 150,000 people
[2:14:57] are praising a a young man 31 years of
[2:15:01] age who just said, "I want to be a
[2:15:04] witness for Christ."
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; And he didn't mind debating. I I may not
[2:15:09] agree with his platform, but I sure do
[2:15:12] like his stand. He was not ashamed.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; And I say, God, let me not be ashamed
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; to align myself up with this message.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of it.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; I am not.
[2:15:31] I am not
[2:15:33] I'm not ashamed of this gospel.
[2:15:43] Let me stand.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to debate it. I'm just
[2:15:50] saying let me stand and be a witness.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know if they are having a
[2:15:56] memorial service for brother Biscll
[2:15:58] today or not. I don't know. I already
[2:16:01] had
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; next Sunday.
[2:16:06] Lord willing.
[2:16:08] if I can, I'll be up there next Sunday
[2:16:12] because I was told it might be today.
[2:16:14] And I thought, wouldn't it be
[2:16:16] kind of ironic that you got a memorial
[2:16:19] service for Charlie Kirk and one of a
[2:16:23] end time witness? Let me tell you,
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; brother Biscll,
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; what a witness.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; I tell you, he
[2:16:38] was not afraid to let his voice blend
[2:16:42] with the voice of the seventh angel.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I thought if these two
[2:16:52] memorials are going on at the same time,
[2:16:55] I thought here is one out here and and
[2:16:59] denominational. Excuse me. I'm not
[2:17:01] making I'm not looking down.
[2:17:04] But I want you to understand
[2:17:07] we're raised above
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; that standard
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; by the voice of the seventh angel. When
[2:17:16] he should begin to sound, you know what
[2:17:18] he was doing? He was finishing the
[2:17:20] mystery.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; He was preaching a message that
[2:17:25] identified
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; elected. Amen.
[2:17:28] Amen.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "I say just enough of the word.
[2:17:32] If they're elected, they'll catch it."
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen to that?
[2:17:37] When I heard the voice,
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; of that seventh angel,
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; there was something inside of me that
[2:17:43] gripped me.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; It caught me.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; If you've been caught up by that seventh
[2:17:50] angel, you'll be caught up in the
[2:17:54] rapture when it comes.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; How do I know? I'm already caught.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; I'm already being reeled in.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; And when the rapture happens, I want to
[2:18:04] be one of those which are alive and
[2:18:05] remain to the coming of the Lord will
[2:18:07] not hinder those which sleep.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; We caught up together.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:14] Brother Biscll's over there
[2:18:17] shaking hands.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; He stood for this gospel.
[2:18:24] May we stand for this gospel.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together this this
[2:18:29] morning. Do you love him?
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[2:18:37] Open the eyes of my heart.
[2:18:42] I want to see you.
[2:18:48] I want to see you.
[2:18:55] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[2:19:00] Open the eyes of my heart.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see you.
[2:19:10] Yes, I
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; I want to see
[2:19:14] to see you high and lifted up. will see
[2:19:17] you high and lifted up.
[2:19:22] Oh, shining in the light of your glory.
[2:19:28] Oh, pour out your power and love
[2:19:33] as we sing. Holy, holy, holy.
[2:19:42] I want to see you.
[2:19:48] I want to see you.
[2:19:54] If anybody knows about the love of
[2:19:59] Jesus.
[2:20:02] Oh, I do.
[2:20:06] I do.
[2:20:11] If anybody knows about the love of
[2:20:15] Jesus, we are recipients of it. I do.
[2:20:21] Yes, I do. I know about the power.
[2:20:27] Anybody knows about the power of Jesus?
[2:20:32] I've experienced it. I do.
[2:20:36] [Music]
[2:20:38] I do.
[2:20:43] If anybody know about the power of
[2:20:47] Jesus.
[2:20:48] Amen.
[2:20:52] Amen. We have a baptism in a moment. We
[2:20:54] have a baptism in a moment. But I want
[2:20:57] to sing about the blood of it. If
[2:20:59] anybody knows about the blood,
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; it is an inoculation.
[2:21:06] I do.
[2:21:09] Oh, I do.
[2:21:14] If anybody knows about the blood of
[2:21:19] Jesus.
[2:21:20] Amen. I do.
[2:21:24] Yes, I
[2:21:27] would. We wouldn't be standing here if
[2:21:29] we didn't know about his grace. If
[2:21:31] anybody knows about the grace of Jesus.
[2:21:37] Oh, I do.
[2:21:40] Oh, I do.
[2:21:46] If anybody knows about the grace of
[2:21:50] Jesus,
[2:21:52] I
[2:21:54] do.
[2:21:56] Yes, I do.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; We have a baptismal today. If you you're
[2:22:02] if anyone would like if God touched your
[2:22:04] heart and you want to get baptized too,
[2:22:06] the water's here. Brother Ron will be
[2:22:08] doing a baptism shortly. But before we
[2:22:11] go, I want to sing that song of Ruth.
[2:22:14] I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. Is
[2:22:17] your life saying yes to his will this
[2:22:21] morning? The song of Ruth says, I'll say
[2:22:24] yes. Oh, I'll say yes.
[2:22:31] Not my voice but my life. I'll say yes.
[2:22:38] Oh to your will,
[2:22:43] Lord.
[2:22:46] I'll say yes.
[2:22:53] Where you?
[2:22:57] Oh, we just heard about the power of it.
[2:23:00] I will.
[2:23:03] [Music]
[2:23:05] Oh, I'll see.
[2:23:09] Lord,
[2:23:12] I'll see. Can you lift your hands and
[2:23:16] say it as a declaration today?
[2:23:20] Say yes, Lord. I will. I will.
[2:23:25] I say yeah.
[2:23:30] Oh hallelujah
[2:23:32] of your will,
[2:23:35] Lord.
[2:23:37] Oh, I'll say yes.
[2:23:42] Hallelujah.

[2:23:46] me.

[2:24:10] the baptism,
