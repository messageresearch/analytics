as we commit the time the service and everything that will be said and done in this place for your own glory in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen we greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen as we remain standing we can just flip open our Bibles I know all of us as uh human beings we can flip the pages of this Bible and turn and open it and look at it and read but it takes the Lamb of God to come and give us the content that's right shall we start with Ephesian chapter 1 verse 3-9 let's read blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world thank you Lord that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Amen to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he ha abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself amen also can we read in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 Galatians chapter 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me amen the last scripture is going to be Luke chapter 10 verse 20 not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven Hallelujah may the Lord add the blessings to the reading of his word as you have your seats I felt kind of keep continuing with the little subject that I started last time our journey started in God's mind amen that's the sermon but for the subject I prefer to go with from your book of life to the Lamb's Book of Life amen as I said last time our journey as Believers especially as the Bride of Jesus Christ didn't start here on Earth when we were born amen our journey started in the mind of God because the Bible says the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world in his mind bar bam says we made a a choice because we had the free moral agency between the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but in his mind we made our choice to go for the tree of life amen so he knew who would Cho made a make a choice of the tree of life and who make a choice for the tree of the knowledge of evil and good but for those that have made the choice to go for the tree of life he decided first to write down their names in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah and the lamb has to give himself as a sacrifice to die for this one that had made a choice for the Tree of Life butam says in the message questions and answer number four preached in 1964 uh August the 30th let's read that notice a mother she can be ever so mean and cruel but just before that baby is born there's a certain kindness that sits in did you ever notice a mother when she's to be mother there's something sweet about her she always takes she always take on that sweetness it's because that little angel Little Spirit a little Messenger to this little Tabernacle is ready to come forth into the world and then when this little angel comes into the body that's a little angel of the earth a spirit that's ordained of God to take this body then that baby has to have a choice it makes its decision then when it takes and then when this takes place then you see the angel of the Lord now comes in in here which is the spiritual body the Eternal that Eternal this is a dying spirit in a dying body but now you cannot you can't be in two bodies at one time but there there can be two Natures in you at one time now the nature of this Spirit of the Lord when you are born again you are not born of physical like the baby was but what happened the spiritual Birth has come to you thank you Lord and while the spiritual birth is growing into your heart of of God there is a physical or a Celestial body growing to receive that spirit and when the life leaves this body it goes to that body amen just as when the body is presented to the Earth the spirit comes in and when the spirit goes out of this body there is a body waiting Hallelujah for we know that after this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting see that's it the spiritual body of the people so here bam was trying of answering this question was trying to show that when we come here on this Earth there's a spiritual there's a spirit I meant to say there's a spirit which is Earthly spirit that was ordained by God to dwell in the body as soon as he's born this is an Earthly spirit that comes into this body and he says at a certain point this child will have to make a choice which means will be placed exactly like in the mind of God placed between the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and if you have noticed it when this Spirit comes in the body there's a life a life started but this Earthly spirit in this Earthly body they are naturally against the word of God that's how you start living your life until the choice is presented to you to make whether you're going to be with the tree of life or the tree of knowledge of evil and good but until then you'll be living your life that's the book of your life that is being written and Bam says when were born cu the little children one time they were brought to Jesus and he said when the disciples was trying to prevent them from being brought to him he said don't prevent them from coming to me see because brother bam says they they don't have the sin of their own they still little so if they die between that age they go straight in heaven amen because they don't have a sin to repent for and then then when you start growing up whatever life until you reach the age of accountability like bam says and if you have noticed the devil is imitating the the god most of the time you go in the book of uh in uh Psalms 90 the prayer of Moses he's talking about our lives God has given us the time to live until 7 years and for the strongest one they go un 80 and God always take the the the thighs of everything we have in our lives even of our life here on the earth that's why that first time that first time we are the the first uh years of our life before we reach that the the age of accountability God doesn't count that amen that's why the devil you see can you take the the the the compact CD when he plays the first part is blank and then start recording and at the end is blank again that's the devil imitating the Lord amen so when you reach that age they start recording all the deeds in what whatever you say your voices your mind and everything they start being recorded until when you reach or you have the choice to make between the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil each and every one of us we went through this process at certain point of life you be presented you be given a chance to make a choice of which tree you be go with let's read brother bam in Souls that are in prison now 1963 October 11th he says this now The Souls of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that is the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man when he said we are the scripture plainly tells us we are dead and our lives are HID in God through Christ sealed there by the holy spirit amen now I wasn't now it wasn't that your body died it wasn't that it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is God if you are born again if it's not it's of the world anything that begins has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living soul then you begin then but when you that nature that was in You by Nature you of the world alienated from God you were actually an animal that's exactly right anyone knows that we are mmal amen how many knows that we are M we are a warm-blooded animal but but that is what we are by our Earthly creation but you see what made us different from other animals was that God put a soul upon us now the other mammals don't have to wear clothes no other animals has to wear clothes to heed his shame but us we are the only ones that does because we have a soul but see God in the beginning knew what a man would be like and he created the Earth and brought up all kinds of animals from every lowest to the highest and the highest animal come forth was a man amen we can take Paul of old Paul lived his life was born as all human being having the Earthly Spirit he lived his life until that day when he was persecuting the uh Christians when the pillow of fire met with him telling him why are you persecuting me so when he met God he made a choice because the tree of life was presented to him amen he made a choice to believe and to go with the Tree of Life he left that place and went to Saudi Arabia searching the scriptures and he understood that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever let's read in Philippians and see what I didn't give the scripture to the brothers to project it Philippians chapter 3 from verse 7 until verse 9 this is Paul saying after he was converted but what things were gained to me those accounted loss for Christ yeah dless in account all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but D that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own mind own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith amen you see Paul lived his life with the humanistic Spirit or the Earthly spirit that was in him he lived his life and the Book of his life was written butam says for those of you who are dreaming when you dream which means a part of you was somewhere you say otherwise your memory can could not record it because that's the reality because a part of you was somewhere the same way as we are living our natural life here everything we do in our conscience in our or in our subconscious are recorded in our memory that's the book our book of life amen that's why baram when he was making discernment was going into different realm into different dimension he could see what went through in your life amen who could read your book of life that's your spirit is a human being Earthly spirit that dwelt in this body that made you live that life but now after that you will be given a chance this is now we're going to talk about the book of Lamb's life so when you receive Christ that's how he comes in you like bam says that baby has to have the Natural Spirit or Earthly Spirit at a certain point an angel of the Lord a Celestial by the celestial spirit will come that's when they are born again amen and now after you lived your life which is mostly against God's word but as after you make your choice of the tree of life then God himself will start living his own life through you amen that's why Paul says here it's not me living but it's Christ in me living amen so now we're going from your book of of life to the Lamb's Book of Life if your name was not written in this Lamb's Book of Life there's no way absolutely no way you can live the life of Christ amen because God has to come in your life to live his own life life butam says it's not you it's not your righteousness but this is his own righteousness it's him living his own word in you thank you Lord butam says here in forsaking all 1962 the 23rd of January Jesus said or the scripture says he that loves the world and the things of the world the love of God is not even in him that's right it takes forsaking all there when you were willing to forsake all and follow him then if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it will be done for you amen but you cannot knowing that those things are wrong you know they are wrong the Bible says against them card playing cigarette smoking drinking wearing you moral clothes and then claiming to be Christian if that spirit in you does not condemn that then there's something wrong with the spirit that is in you amen because the God who wrote the word is the word amen and the word is in you yeah and it condemns you it's got to and it doesn't and if it doesn't you are being deceived amen so here let me let me make some comment here that's why in this same time the light that we have received the message that we have received is the true message from God is the true light but sometimes people are walking in false conception of this True Light amen you want to make sure you have the right conception of this true light that have come to us how can the Holy Spirit write something and you turn around and do contrary to it and say the holy spirit is leading you you can't do it right so smoking cigarettes drinking whiskey playing cards cutting hair wearing shorts and all these other things are wrong sinful wrong and you'll never get anywhere until you quit it amen that's creeping into our Pentecostal move shame on you you ought to be ashamed no wonder we can't have a worldwide Wonder we can't have a Pentecostal Revival Something's Happened that's right we've laid down the bars amen things are taking place that shouldn't take Place therefore you must forsake all to follow Christ you must forsake your own ideas you must cope with this word and never will the holy ghost ever deny any word it ever spoke that's right and the Bible is wrote by the Holy Spirit the Bible said so and if the Bible the Bible the Bible word is God in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh amen and dwelt Among Us Now word is made Spirit dwelling in us for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world the consum the consum cons consummation now if that same God that wrote the Bible is in you you're not your own you are de to the things of the world you are de to your own thoughts and the mind that the mind that was in Christ be in you there then you are forsaking all to follow him not your own thoughts what he says not my will thine Lord then you begin to line up with God's word could stay there a long time but will just run on a little father but you say what do I get then forsaking all forsaking all you see the Young Rich ruler but the bom says he was young he was strong handsome he had whatever he was like an well of man he had money he didn't have any need of anything cuz that's what most people are looking for amen but he was lacking one thing he realized he was walking with the false conception of the True Light he realized he didn't have eternal life which you and I have tonight thank you Lord we can have what he had but for him to have what we have stough hallelujah what he had most people are running working hard to get you know to where he was right to stay young healthy handsome beautiful whatever name it have more money he had it right but he didn't have what we have he didn't have eternal life amen he came but whatam says to the right person that's right the tree of life was presented to him he made a choice the the Earthly Spirit was in him all this time making money looking beautiful and handsome and everything else but when he got to make his choice of the tree of life he could not he's supposed to forsake all amen most people they want to collect whatever have at the same time walk with God no it's not going to work that way when he made a choice of Abraham he told him because before God start with Abraham he had a covenant which was conditional Covenant with Adam and Eve if you do this I will do this if if if and a righteous God and a sinful man that could not get along with that Covenant that's right man was falling all the time and God made a a change that's why when he called Abraham he told him you're not going to do nothing I will do everything Hallelujah just on you you you just have to believe what I done already that's unconditional Covenant you don't have to do nothing so the Young Rich ruler looking at his wealth looking at everything he was like no I'm not going to do what you're asking me to do forsaking everything and most people are and brother bam says when Jesus looked at him the Bible says he loved him and butam say he must have a good spirit you get it good spirit nothing wrong he knew the Commandment of God cuz most people they believe having a good spirit right coming to church doing everything else is good I'm going to heaven no no no no you don't have to have the false conception of the True Light he had it amen he came to the right person he asked the right question he received the right answer but he took a wrong decision amen and I believe tonight you guys didn't take a wrong decision thank you Lord amen that's why this message has come to take the Amnesia away to take the confusion away we want to make sure that we have the true conception of the True Light amen otherwise we be deceiving ourselves that's right that's why at a certain time we leave our lives we have our own Book of Life whatever deed we did our our thoughts and everything we have done in our lives there's a book but at a certain time when we receive Christ that's how God himself comes in us he will come to live in us to write his own book praise the Lord you go in Old Testament you can pick up Moses David all of them they live the life of Christ at certain point at a certain time you live your life but it has to come a time where God has to live his own life in you amen let me tell you something in the mind of God when you made your choice to go with the Tree of Life God put the name or your name in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah he put you in the book but the book at certain time the book has to be in you that's right we'll get to there I don't want to get ahead of myself and This Book of [Applause] Life butam says in the in Gabriel's Gabriel's instruction Gabriel's instru instructions to Daniel 1961 the 30th of July now we found that he was a Kingsman Redeemer and he took the book out of the hand of original owner it is a title deed to Redemption we found that you remember that study it's a title deed of redemption it's an abstract deed with it that God required life for death in the Garden of Eden then Jesus the righteous one died and took a little a title deed and was able to break the seals reveal what was in them and give the inheritance that belonged to him to his people eternal life that he inherited by doing that he passed his own life back out at Calvary and divided it among us but the Holy Ghost amen amen thank you Lord no man has never been able to even think of the love that was that that was what he done Satan the one's possessor because he because of the fall in in in at Garden is bound is bound and cast into the Lake of Fire he says our his days are finished Jesus in gospel had four titles we C that son of David he to the throne son of Abraham the Royal Grant son of man heir of the earth Son of God heir to All Things the Royal Grant in the Old Testament property could not be held any longer than 50 years it could not be annihilated from its original honor but 50 years and on that 40th day he paid the price on the 50th day the Redemption and the power that belonged to the church that was lost in the Garden of Eden was redeemed back and send to us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the 50th day let me say something here so you know the me like I said the message we have received is not like a the message of a man it's a message that have come from God himself am the same God that at the Pentecost day who have come down in the form of pill of fire and divided himself and dwell and hung over the disciples is the same God that has come in this end time amen if we had camera on that day would have taken the picture of exactly the same py that we're seeing today amen that py was on the top of each one of the disciples you see brother bam on the top of William brandham at a certain point he said this pill of fire is coming is dwelling is getting into my body that's why Paul says it's not me living but it's Christ in me living through this body amen we picked up the Scrolls how that the scroll was handed into his hands how that Jeremiah in Jeremiah 32:6 his cousin Haniel left him some ha and they was going into captivity which we are going into with him this morning captivity and it was kept in an Earthly vessel there's something here that is very deep shows where the power of God and the Scrolls and the secret of God is known in the heart amen is I said in God's mind you made your choice God put your names in the in his book The Book of Lamb's life that's why when John was weeping after he heard the voice saying who is worthy to take the book and to loosen up the seals and nobody was found in heaven on the earth nobody was found and John wept butam say why John wept because nobody was found and if there's nobody found to lose the seals and the whole nature and the whole creation was be it has to be lost right and John remember when he was on the earth Jes Jesus told them don't Rejoice because of the spirits are subject to you but Rejoice rather that your names are written in the heaven where in the Lamb's Book of Life for Us that's our joy right we can't Rejoice for anything Miracles and things yes it's good those are the blessings of the children but we need to Rejoice because our names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah how do you know your names is called the name is not like uh Jonathan or David no that's an Earthly name that your family gave to you when John the Baptist was asked one One Time by uh Hebrews people they came to him who are you tell us who you are his name was John of course what did he say I'm the voice speaking in the wilderness that's his name and that was written before the foundation of the world was there and when the time of fulfillment has come John recognized his name in the book hallelujah our names are written in the form of mysteries right when the Mysteries are revealed in this end time you know when the call you you turn around because they call your name brother Mark you you turn so when the Mysteries are being preached to us we Rejoice we are happy those are our names being called Thank You Lord what is your name you can go in Malachi 4 behold I was say to you that you that's your name it's not a earth name John Mark no no Mysteries John was whipping until the lamb stood up slain bleeding and then the Bible says they sng a new song Amen because the lamb stood up to get the book and to loosen the seals praise the Lord and when the loose the seals then you can see your names showing that showing it shows where the power of God and the the Scrolls and the secret of God is known in the heart this is exactly what Jeremiah did he left those books with his cousin but they put it in the Earth this is the earth too amen amen this book that has been handed to the mighty angel in Revelation 10 we're going to follow the trip of that book now because at some point in mind of God you were put your names or you were in that book but now this book has to be in you that's where I'm going to take you now let's read in uh Revelation chapter 10 I don't know I'm going to I'm going in I don't know how the the holy spirit is guiding me we're going here and touch here and touch there amen I wish I was going the way I put it but we have to follow the we have to yield to the leadership of the holy spirit thank you Lord Revelation chapter 10 we can read chapter 10: 2 and we're going to read verse 7 no verse 8 uh to 11 let's read verse two and he had in his hands we're talking about a mighty Angel a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth that book that he had in his hand that's the same that's the Bible this is the title deed the mighty Angel has that book a little book was open not closed open let's go down on verse 8 of the same same chapter 10 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take that little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth he said and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the book give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth so sweet is honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongs and Kings amen but but bam says John represented the bride which we are he had to go take that little book from the hands of the mighty Angel take it and the angel says take it and eat it up he says it was sweet in my mouth when they preaching the Mysteries they are preaching all the Mysteries revealed in this end time you rejoice your amen amen but as soon as it gots into your Bly you become bitter which means when it comes to apply or to leave that word out stuff that's right the Bible the word of God tells you to forsake all oh no it's tough but when the preach the mystery amen we go to heaven and things leave it out tough Bitter Sweet in your mouth sweet when you listen to it but this book we can track the trip of this book book but abam says the original owner of this book is God himself in fact this book when it was given I want to give you something when it was given to Adam or to humankind was a spoken word because in Genesis God was telling them right you will have dominion on the earth everything will be under you butam says Adam was like an immature God on the earth amen when the book was given to Adam was in the spoken word form right and in this end time when we receive this book again it's a spoken word amen butam says Adam lost this book when Satan came in lied to them and B says they dirty hands of the devil could not hold that book for a long time no it has to go back in the hands of the original owner which is God himself but this book is for us for as Believers you cannot stay in the hands of God because this Earth God gave it to us not to this human body but to the spiritual body in us right because the true us is not this right because he said he told Adam you're going to subdue you're going to have dominion on everything that is creeping on the earth including this body because it's moving too you have to keep your body subject to the Holy Spirit that's why this book which is the title deed has to go back to the original owner and he's not going to keep it for a long time because he need to go back back to the human being so God kept that book until at this end time in uh Revelation chapter 5 where I didn't give that scripture but we can just read it chapter 5 of Revelation let's read that's the same thing I was just talking about here so chapter 5:3 and no man in Heaven Nor in in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on even to look at the book nobody was found worthy amen and one of the elders sayith unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the Ruth of David has prevailed and open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beast in the midst of the elders stood a lamp as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and the four the Beast and the four and the 20 Elders fell down before the lamp having every one of them Harps and and golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of the Saints you see the book was of the original honor he gave it to Adam Adam lost it because of this the devil that came and begal them and God took it back in this end time the Lamb of God because he's worthy he was slain before the foundation of the world and he was slain he on the earth he took the book out of the one out of the hands of the one that was sit in the throne which is God Amen and now the book from the Lambs ended up in the hands of the mighty angel from the hands of the mighty Angels bam says John represent the bride John had to go take that book and John took the little book what did John uh what did John do with the book The the angel told him eat it up and Bam says it shows where the power of God the Scrolls and the secrets of God known in the heart amen that book has to go in the heart of the human being amen was not made to put on the shelves when we take the message books and we read them no we put them in the shelves no we read them we' have to eat them up amen amen because the very place of this book is in our heart amen when when Adam heard this book he had Authority on the Earth but abam says he could do whatever he could with the the the Creations you might ask but was was was Adam in in the in the mind of God too yes cuz the Bible says he named all the creatures God send all the animals and all the creatures to see what name Adam will call them right Adam was calling the name of animals God was saying amen which means Adam was giving exactly the name that was in the mind of God that's right same ways when the Mysteries are revealing to us are revealed to us we say Amen because we know we heard them somewhere praise the Lord cuz Adam was giving the name and God knew that's exactly is the name that I had in my mind that's why we're saying amen and the name by the bottom says it's a character right let's read the prophet here again where is that scripture go whatam says in the Revelation chapter 5 part 1 61 was preaching 1961 the June 11th or November the 6th he said now notice what did we lose well it was given to Adam to have eternal life as long as he ate from the tree he had eternal life and we notice again that Adam was he inherited the Earth he was like an amateur God over the Earth the Earth was his everything was given into his hands he could do with it whatever he wanted to he named it he called it and he done whatever he wanted to he was truly a son of God now in fail Adam forfeited it forfeited the title deed to that he fored it to Satan Satan took the title deed Adam was very sloly and he did not redeem it he did not redeem his right for he could not redeem his right but Satan which does not rightfully own it but he possesses it he is the God of this Earth the Bible says so he possesses that not because that he really rightfully gets it but he possesses it now do you get it Satan possesses that he holds it in his hands death is in his hands the Earth is in his hands the world belong to him every nation belongs to him he governs controls the whole world and everything in the world in the Gard of Eden before Satan came to attempt Adam and Eve when they were one in one body there was no way Satan could deceive them because the bride and the bridegroom was one they were in one body so after God divided them in different body that's how the devil came he didn't even come when Adam and Eve were together when Adam was somewhere he came to the weak part of a human being which is his wife and we are the bride and a woman as long as she's married she's protected by her husband nobody can come and fool around because she's married amen until there's separation and anybody can come but as long as she's married she's protected by her husband that's why brother bam preached the uh invisible Union that's the time we are living in we need to be United or reunited with our husbands cuz when the devil will come he's confused he doesn't know whether it's a is it brother Robert or is he God that's why we need to eat the book that's why I'm showing you the trip of the book amen from original honor which is God all the way down in our heart and when we eat the book that's how we get back our title deed because all the blessings as Paul says here in Ephesians he says he blessed us with all spiritual blessing in Heavenly places didn't start here started over there we are predestinated to that in predestination bam says it doesn't mean you can do whatever you want no no cuz the Bible says if you do the things of the world you love them the love of God is not even in you amen you have to show that you were there right so I hated Jacob I love Jacob did whatever he could to get the right the the birth right you don't have to live all kind of life and ex one day expect one day to go in heaven right no and the whole world belongs to him now in this end time this title dat this book has come to us and the only way the lamb can live his own life in us it's when we receive this book in US amen otherwise it's going to be our life continuing we will just living our book of life will be continuing we don't want to be walking in deception or in a false con conception of the True Light that's why the final destination of this book it in US amen we were in the book that's why Jesus said on that day you will know that I'm in my father my father is in me I'm in him and I'm I'm in you you in me this day amen now you know where he came from from before the foundation of the world when you made that choice your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life which means at some point you leave your life at some point the lamb when you accept him he come in your life leave his own life through the body of the flesh Paul said it it's not me living it's Christ in me amen and if it's him in you yes you're not going to walk in false conception of his light you can't walk and do anything except to be him leading you no because that's him living his own life in you amen now that you are in the book and the book has to be in you you see the final resting place of the book Amen in our hearts amen right it's not a closed book it's an open book that's right and we all of us were able to see our names we heard our names being called all the Mysteries and what one them shows how the the the book was was um rolled up was like Scrolls like this when Jeremiah heard it and baram says that's how the seals were that's how this book was and now when the lamb took the book has to loosen the seals to see the Mysteries inside right and the lamb which is Christ himself has to open the seventh seal first for you to see the first seal the seventh seal has to be open because was the first the sixth I mean the seventh the six the fifth the fourth the third second and one so which mean means he has to unveil himself the Mighty God unveiled among us he has to reveal himself we are living in the time where everything is open I mean if God himself can reveal himself how much more all of us that's why he says the book is open and the books are open the books of Our Lives that's why bar was saying holding the prayer line he says if you have a sin that you did not confess do it now because if you come here you'll be exposed which means books are opened that's right our books of our lives are opened when you read this message we are exposed because the lamb himself unveiled himself now we see even the devil is unveiled we see where he started and where he's going that's right the book is open and then when he unveils himself start opening all the rest of the seals that's how we saw the first seal second third what happened Y and we heard our names aren't you glad you heard your name oh Hallelujah aren't you glad you you are the one to receive this open book in your heart but you're not going to keep it with in you just say like that no you have to prophesy to because it says chapter 10 of Revelation he say it says verse 10 no let's take verse no start verse 10 chapter 10 verse 10 of uh Revelation he said and I took the little book out of the Angel's hands and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten up I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people in Nations and tongues and Kings amen not only prophesy preaching you can leave it out your life because the lamb the book is in you our our bridegroom is in US amen we're not separated no more of our bridegroom where the devil can come and do all kind of things on us when he approaches us he's confused he look at you but in you our bridegroom isn't there amen this is the invisible Union this is the time we have to be United with our husband we're not widows our husband has come this is the time of marriage cuz you live by yourself you are vulnerable very good you are exposed you are like a a wife without husband and any man can come and play around with you but when you are together when the book is in you because you were in the book now the book is in you yeah the enemy will be confused that's why when he was approaching Jesus cuz God was made flesh when he was coming he was confused sometimes tell us openly are you Christ if he was confused then he has to be confused today amen but for that to happen we need to receive the book eat it up not in our mind but bam says in our heart that's where the secret that's where the Scrolls has to dwell why in our heart might close with this one because in our subconscious that's where our power lays not in our mind cu the body has five senses the spirit have five senses but the only sense which is the the subconscious that's where the power comes from because something that comes from your subconscious is unconscious when it comes out we you we we heard a lot about addiction people being addicted with this and that but we need to be addicted with the word of God Amen to the point where if you can't eat it you are restless you need to eat it that's the kind of addiction we want eat it up so in in your subconscious that's where your power is the devil is not powerful that's right you heard people like oh he sold his soul to the devil of course he sold his soul to the devil because the devil for him to do but what I'm saying is the spirit if he doesn't have a body to use it's going to be powerless if people have sold their souls to the devil we need to S to sell our souls to God Amen amen you know when you pray for someone that is not even close to you far away maybe in different country he's healed and he say that the same time I was praying cuz your soul you P out you were pouring out your soul you were praying for him from your soul that somebody was healed same way God from someone's soul that he's been sold to the devil diseases and the curse are going to you know to other people because somebody sold his soul to the devil in the same way you pray somebody's healed in the same way people are sold selling their soul to the devil you see so the final place for the book is in your heart amen my prayer tonight is take the book eat it up for you to be one with your bridegroom that has come amen that way the devil cannot fool around with you because you are married this is the invisible Union let us confuse the enemy amen when he comes is this what r or no it's him but it's not him because the husband is in his soul amen at some point he says Paul I know Jesus I know who are you because they didn't have a husband in them right let's stand to our feet shall we pray father we are so thankful that even though we prepare the service we prepare the sermons and we think in our little mind that we can say it or however we want to say it but it takes you to come you the Lamb of God and to open the book and to reveal and to say it the way you want it to be saved father I believe this little message it's a blessing to someone tonight yes even to myself oh God may you cause us to go home and be pondering upon this Bible this book that we have received in this end time an open book not a closed book help us to eat it up to become one of this book yes Lord this is the final resting place of this book in our hearts in our souls you did not intended this book to stay in your hands you not intended it to be in the hands of the devil forever but this book this title did was for Adam and his offsprings we are the seeds of Adam this book has come back to us oh God and we want to eat it up even though sometimes it's uh bitter when it comes to apply it but we ask for your mercy to help us yes leave it out oh God it's not our righteousness it's your righteousness we do not depend on our abilities but we depend on your abilities yes Lord we want you to come down in our lives and leave your own word through our own lives oh Father this is the time you want to live your own life in our in our [Music] heart forgive us oh father have mercy on us oh Jesus we know the
