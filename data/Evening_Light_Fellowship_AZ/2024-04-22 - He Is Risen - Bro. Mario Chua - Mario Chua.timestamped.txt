[59:33] for opening his presence actually what
[59:36] we see to today is about Jesus is also
[59:40] what I'm going to preach this
[59:43] morning the title is he is
[59:46] risen that's the be purpose that we are
[59:49] here because he is risen and he promised
[59:52] because I leave you shall leave
[59:54] also amen amen and I trust that the Lord
[59:58] will move in the scene this morning that
[1:00:02] every what uh whatever needs we
[1:00:05] have God will just meet it according to
[1:00:08] the riches of his glory so turn with me
[1:00:11] in the book of Isaiah 63 verse
[1:00:19] 4 maybe I will just uh take my time this
[1:00:22] morning wherever the Lord leads amen so
[1:00:26] so I am depending on the presence of the
[1:00:29] Lord and I am also depending upon how
[1:00:31] you pull on the
[1:00:33] gate because if you are blessed I am
[1:00:37] blessed because sometime we study and as
[1:00:41] you pull sometime what comes out from
[1:00:44] our mouth is not even in our notes amen
[1:00:47] so it's according to how you pull that
[1:00:50] God will meet yes amen amen because he
[1:00:53] is alive amen amen he is risen and he is
[1:00:57] alive and some
[1:00:59] wonder where is he when he is alive amen
[1:01:03] so being born again baptized with the
[1:01:04] Holy Ghost we know that he is in our
[1:01:07] heart amen you don't look for any places
[1:01:11] for Christ
[1:01:13] amen just look beside you in front of
[1:01:17] you in back of you because Christ in the
[1:01:19] Throne of the heart of these people
[1:01:22] Isaiah
[1:01:24] 63:4 for the day
[1:01:26] of vengeance is in Mine Heart and the
[1:01:30] year of my redeem is come so you will
[1:01:34] notice vengeance is in my heart and the
[1:01:37] year of my redeem so the day of
[1:01:40] Vengeance and the time of redemption are
[1:01:42] always together in the Bible and we are
[1:01:45] now living in that day amen the same
[1:01:48] time judgments in the land against the
[1:01:52] people that rejected the message of the
[1:01:54] hour right it's the same time that the
[1:01:57] mercy of God is being poured out amen
[1:02:00] the same time that Noah was about to be
[1:02:02] redeemed and carried into the new Earth
[1:02:04] was the same time that judgment is in
[1:02:07] the land against the people that had
[1:02:09] rejected the message right in the time
[1:02:12] of Abraham and Sarah is the same thing
[1:02:14] before he judged Sodom praise God God
[1:02:17] visited Abraham and Sarah and I believe
[1:02:20] we are in the same time right now
[1:02:23] because we have the prophet which is the
[1:02:25] final
[1:02:26] Hallelujah the sign of judgment and God
[1:02:29] sent us a message of the
[1:02:32] hour and those who reject the message
[1:02:35] praise God will be on the Judgment of
[1:02:38] Goden Matthew chapter
[1:02:42] 28 verse 1-
[1:02:47] 2 and it say in the end of the Sabbath
[1:02:51] as it began to Don toward the first day
[1:02:53] of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the
[1:02:56] other Mary to see the
[1:02:59] Seiler so in the Book of Genesis which
[1:03:02] is in the beginning light came on the
[1:03:04] first day of the week amen and light
[1:03:07] brings life and light comes when the Sun
[1:03:11] rises
[1:03:13] Amen on the first day of the week let
[1:03:16] there be light and it brings life to
[1:03:19] whatever SE it is amen the
[1:03:22] Lord and behold there was a great
[1:03:24] earthquake for the angel of the Lord
[1:03:27] descended from
[1:03:28] heaven so we are
[1:03:31] reading the
[1:03:32] scripture as a message believer we know
[1:03:36] that the seals was open so we are
[1:03:38] reading the
[1:03:40] scriptures based on the opening of The
[1:03:43] Seven Seals we no longer read the Bible
[1:03:46] according to the denominational
[1:03:49] understanding but since the opening of
[1:03:52] the SE Seven Seals we understand
[1:03:54] different the Bible becomes a new book
[1:03:58] our understanding is
[1:04:04] different and behold it was a great
[1:04:07] earthquake for the angel of the Lord
[1:04:09] descended from heaven and we also have
[1:04:12] an angel descended from heaven in this
[1:04:15] hour at the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:04:18] Revelation 21 the mighty angel coming
[1:04:21] down yes this event have repeated again
[1:04:24] in this day yes it's always in the
[1:04:27] present tense and came and rolled back
[1:04:31] the Stone from the door and sat upon it
[1:04:35] so what did the stone
[1:04:37] seal it sealed the word amen so when the
[1:04:41] descending Angel broke the seal and
[1:04:44] rolled the stone away it opened the word
[1:04:48] that was sealed and that is what the
[1:04:50] opening of The Seven Seals did for us
[1:04:53] today amen when the descending angel
[1:04:55] with an open book in his right hand open
[1:04:58] the seal and reveal the word into our
[1:05:01] days hallelujah so my title this morning
[1:05:05] he is risen do you believe amen he is
[1:05:08] risen that's why we are here amen
[1:05:11] because he is risen so the subject is
[1:05:13] the three stages of how God revealed
[1:05:16] himself to us in his resurrection in
[1:05:19] this day amen because what happened then
[1:05:22] happens now we just have a more
[1:05:25] understanding
[1:05:26] what happened then because of the
[1:05:28] opening of The Seven seal so as brother
[1:05:30] George Martin once said you may now take
[1:05:33] your seat or may you take the comfort of
[1:05:36] your seat while I remain standing for an
[1:05:39] hour
[1:05:40] or God bless you
[1:05:43] amen so we'll continue on the same
[1:05:47] thought in Isaiah chapter
[1:05:49] 61 verse 1 and
[1:05:52] two which says the spirit of the Lord is
[1:05:55] upon upon me because the Lord had
[1:05:58] anointed me to preach the Good
[1:06:01] Tidings andto the meek he had sent me to
[1:06:04] bind the
[1:06:06] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[1:06:09] captive and the opening of the prison to
[1:06:13] them that are
[1:06:15] bound verse two to proclaim the
[1:06:18] acceptable year of the Lord and the day
[1:06:21] of Vengeance so we can read again the
[1:06:23] day of Vengeance to come all that mourn
[1:06:27] amen Vengeance and Redemption goes the
[1:06:30] same likewise so there is a 2,000 years
[1:06:34] g a time of Gap that divides this verse
[1:06:36] two into two parts the first part we
[1:06:39] believe that God fulfill it amen perform
[1:06:42] it at his first coming and the second
[1:06:44] part he's performing now at his second
[1:06:47] coming 2,000 years later so the second
[1:06:50] part of this verse is the work that he
[1:06:52] has come to do in this D day which is B
[1:06:57] Vengeance and comfort amen and we know
[1:07:00] that Abraham was being comforted while
[1:07:02] he was bringing vengance to Sodom so
[1:07:05] when Noah and his family were being
[1:07:07] conforted in the ark he was bringing
[1:07:09] judgment on the rest of the world
[1:07:12] likewise in these last days when the
[1:07:14] opening of The Seven Seals the mystery
[1:07:16] was given to the messenger of its age
[1:07:18] and when the messenger Cuts up praise
[1:07:21] God the revelation of the word he
[1:07:22] blasted in the slides and those who
[1:07:25] rejected the message are being judged
[1:07:28] that's right they were given PL but for
[1:07:30] those who receive the message of the
[1:07:32] hour you cannot receive the message of
[1:07:35] the hour unless you are ordained to
[1:07:37] receive it hallelujah it's a blessing
[1:07:39] for us to receive the message of the
[1:07:41] hour while this world H is become
[1:07:46] judgment so we can apply Malachi chap 4
[1:07:49] verse1 in our day it says for behold the
[1:07:53] day
[1:07:54] cometh that's shall burn as an oven and
[1:07:57] shall and proud an and all that wickedly
[1:08:00] shall be sh shall be
[1:08:02] stubble so if you will notice he said
[1:08:06] that all the proud and do wickedly shall
[1:08:09] be stubbled two things will be judged
[1:08:13] pride and
[1:08:15] wickedness it is a repetitions of Noah's
[1:08:18] days people are full of Pride and full
[1:08:20] of wickedness because every thought on
[1:08:23] the imagination of their heart was EV
[1:08:25] continually they are so proud so when
[1:08:29] Noah say that God will just the Earth by
[1:08:32] because of your sin and wickedness they
[1:08:34] are so proud oh we cannot do the dirt
[1:08:36] science tell us that there is no rain
[1:08:38] there is no Thunder we we we don't
[1:08:40] believe
[1:08:42] it and God judg it amen and the day that
[1:08:46] cometh shall burn them up said the Lord
[1:08:48] of
[1:08:49] hosts this is speaking to our day in the
[1:08:52] days of Noah it was by the flood but in
[1:08:54] our day It Is by
[1:08:57] fire second Peter 3:10 but oh the day of
[1:09:01] the Lord will come as a th in the night
[1:09:03] it will come amen it will not delayed it
[1:09:08] will
[1:09:09] come in the night as a tip in the night
[1:09:12] in the which the heaven shall pass away
[1:09:14] with great noise and the elements shall
[1:09:17] melt with fervent Heat and the Earth
[1:09:19] also and the work that th there in shall
[1:09:22] be burned up it is on the way that's
[1:09:25] right while the judgment is on the way
[1:09:27] our changing of the body is on the way
[1:09:29] too because they are both comes together
[1:09:32] amen the message of the hour that's why
[1:09:34] the message of the hour is preparing us
[1:09:37] for the changing of our bodies we
[1:09:41] are gathering together in a supernatural
[1:09:45] way that's why the prophet said why are
[1:09:47] you hungering and thirsting church is
[1:09:50] your heavenly father trying to reveal to
[1:09:52] you something and what is this Reve to
[1:09:55] you something something that will make
[1:09:58] us or something that will help us praise
[1:10:01] God turn this Mortal into
[1:10:04] immortality that's why you desire to
[1:10:06] come into the house it is not your own
[1:10:08] desire but it was God's desire that put
[1:10:11] in your heart why do you hunger Church
[1:10:13] it is God himself who put the hungers
[1:10:16] and thirst in your heart because he was
[1:10:18] trying to reveal something in your heart
[1:10:21] he will not reveal it to anybody else he
[1:10:24] will reveal it to those he ordained
[1:10:27] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:29] Hallelujah and you cannot receive it by
[1:10:31] your own will even though how much you
[1:10:33] try Hallelujah to receive the message of
[1:10:35] the hour if you are not ordained you
[1:10:38] will never receive
[1:10:42] it that's why if we are here this
[1:10:44] morning we need to be
[1:10:47] happy amen mding of our head and smiling
[1:10:52] hallelujah our faces that is good but it
[1:10:54] will not give Justice to what he has

[1:11:05] Lord sir
[1:11:08] amen smile is
[1:11:11] good but it cannot give Justice to what
[1:11:13] he has done that's right we need to
[1:11:16] praise him in our life Praise Him day
[1:11:18] praise him in the night praise him when
[1:11:20] the a everything we just need to pray
[1:11:23] him there is no reason
[1:11:26] to be sad or be depressed once the seals
[1:11:29] was open to you you know who you
[1:11:32] are the direction is being
[1:11:35] prepared there is no turning back my
[1:11:37] brother and

[1:11:40] sisters and he says and behold the day
[1:11:44] cometh that shall burn as an oven and
[1:11:46] the proud ye and all that do wickedly
[1:11:49] shall be
[1:11:53] stubbled and the the day that cometh
[1:11:56] shall burn them up said the Lord of
[1:11:58] hosts that he shall leave them neither
[1:12:01] root nor Branch so a root is a a person
[1:12:07] ancestry and a branch is his offspring
[1:12:10] so both ancestry and Offspring will will
[1:12:13] be wiped out just as it also was in the
[1:12:17] days of Noah amen only Noah ancestry and
[1:12:22] those who are in the ark praise God
[1:12:25] continue to flourish but everything else

[1:13:17] I will said Mali or Elijah to you it is
[1:13:22] so personal
[1:13:25] good but unto you that fear my
[1:13:28] name is only speaking about one name so
[1:13:32] trinitarian Doctrine is out of the
[1:13:35] picture that's right two Lo's Doctrine
[1:13:39] is out of the picture there is only one
[1:13:43] name Hallelujah especially when it comes
[1:13:46] to the baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:13:49] Jesus
[1:13:51] Christ those that fear his name because
[1:13:53] in the name of Jesus there there is
[1:13:55] power in the name of Jesus there is
[1:13:59] healing Hallelujah as we as we sing this
[1:14:02] morning in the name of Jesus there is
[1:14:05] salvation in the name of Jesus there is
[1:14:08] Deliverance in the name of Jesus there
[1:14:10] is Restoration in the name of Jesus
[1:14:13] there is redemption in his name there is
[1:14:17] the
[1:14:18] way where there seems to be no way
[1:14:22] sometimes there is something in our life
[1:14:23] that we we take something there's no way
[1:14:25] for this but there is a
[1:14:27] way Hallelujah not only a way but the
[1:14:31] way in his name there is the way in his
[1:14:35] name there is truth when a lot of fake
[1:14:37] news are coming out false Doctrine there
[1:14:40] is still the
[1:14:42] truth thank you Lord in his name there
[1:14:45] is
[1:14:46] life in his name there is fullness of
[1:14:49] joy and in his name there is
[1:14:52] peace so whatever situation you are in
[1:14:55] right now it is only an aimen a way for
[1:14:59] God to fulfill it Hallelujah if you
[1:15:01] believe it it is just an am in way
[1:15:04] whatever situation you are in may be
[1:15:07] sickness may you are bound Hallelujah it

[1:15:22] personally challenge
[1:15:23] us whatever situation you are in right
[1:15:27] now he said if you shall ask
[1:15:31] anything ask

[1:15:44] cannot do it brother bam cannot do it
[1:15:46] but he said I will do
[1:15:49] it Hallelujah we need to raise the level
[1:15:52] of Faith right now because all his
[1:15:55] promise he is obligated to fulfill it no
[1:15:58] other man no other Ministry can fulfill
[1:16:01] what he promised he is the one that
[1:16:03] fulfill
[1:16:06] it don't limit the unlimited
[1:16:09] God just ask
[1:16:12] anything when you say anything anything
[1:16:15] that will hinder you anything that
[1:16:18] anything what's in your mind with your
[1:16:20] thought that you think it is impossible
[1:16:25] God is still in the business of making
[1:16:27] the impossible possible ask anything in
[1:16:30] my name and I will do
[1:16:37] it the present tense will do it that's
[1:16:40] right he knows your thought this morning
[1:16:43] he knows what you've been through this
[1:16:44] morning that's why he's challenged you

[1:16:57] whatever situation you are in right now
[1:16:59] don't be sad don't be discouraged
[1:17:02] because we

[1:17:08] Risen to prove his word among us ask
[1:17:12] anything in my name amen and I will do
[1:17:15] it thank you Jesus so in Matthew chapter
[1:17:19] 8 verse 5 to9 about the
[1:17:22] Centurion and we know the Centurion is a
[1:17:25] Roman army with
[1:17:28] uh sometimes 90 to 100 soldiers under
[1:17:32] his
[1:17:33] command and we know that a centurion is
[1:17:35] just a
[1:17:36] gentile right so this is example and
[1:17:39] when Jesus entered into the capernum
[1:17:41] they came unto him unto him a centurion
[1:17:46] besing
[1:17:48] him amen so when you come and ask God
[1:17:51] you need to Beek
[1:17:53] him and Beek means come before him with
[1:18:01] urgency urgent it is an urgent it's an
[1:18:04] emergency I need you Lord this morning
[1:18:08] whatever you are in I I say and I
[1:18:10] challenge Hallelujah there's nothing too
[1:18:13] hard for God that's right am you need to
[1:18:16] come him and be seeking him with urgency
[1:18:19] whatever you need you need to ask him
[1:18:21] right now with urgency with
[1:18:25] frequency amen hallelujah amen and
[1:18:29] saying
[1:18:31] Lord my servant lith at home sick of the
[1:18:35] py and grievously
[1:18:41] tormented whoever or
[1:18:46] whosoever or whatever com first in your
[1:18:50] mind may it be your friend your family
[1:18:54] your classmate whoever first that come
[1:18:57] into your mind you need to pray for
[1:19:00] that because
[1:19:03] God is putting you in action yeah
[1:19:06] because he is you are his
[1:19:10] coworker whatever name that God put in
[1:19:13] your heart first you need to pray for
[1:19:17] that don't just pray for
[1:19:19] yourself because this Centon Hallelujah
[1:19:23] is asking for his Soldier
[1:19:27] amen don't just pray for yourself alone
[1:19:31] God knows what our needs but there is
[1:19:34] somebody that needs that every person
[1:19:37] that comes your way you need to pray for
[1:19:39] that and he said saying
[1:19:42] Lord my servant lith at the homesick of
[1:19:46] py and grously tormented and and God
[1:19:49] answered right away if you call my name
[1:19:52] I will do it and he said I will come and
[1:19:55] heal
[1:19:57] him
[1:20:00] Hallelujah so his promise is cont with
[1:20:05] consistency Lord my
[1:20:07] servant lith and homesick of the P gly
[1:20:13] tormented he didn't ask him to
[1:20:17] come you just ask for
[1:20:21] prayer so if you have a need this
[1:20:23] morning you don't need to come to the
[1:20:25] pulpit to be
[1:20:28] prayed because when you asked he said I
[1:20:31] will come and heal you thank you Jesus
[1:20:33] his presence is already here because he
[1:20:36] promised wherever two or three are
[1:20:38] gathered in his name he will be in our
[1:20:40] midst so we need to be sensitive enough
[1:20:42] to know that we are praise that
[1:20:44] gathering together
[1:20:47] supernaturally every Gathering is
[1:20:49] Supernatural when you come you will
[1:20:51] never be the same when you come out
[1:20:53] that's right when you come in and you
[1:20:56] you're still the same there must be
[1:20:58] something in
[1:20:59] you because when Jacob as a supplanter
[1:21:02] as Cher backbite there he whistle with
[1:21:05] the
[1:21:07] angel he always looking at himself I am
[1:21:10] Jacob I am supplanter I am a liar I am a
[1:21:13] deceiver but the angel wants to tell him
[1:21:16] no you are not Jacob you are not
[1:21:18] supplanter you're not liar not you are a
[1:21:21] preacher of God so that's why he resol
[1:21:24] sometimes we we always look at oursel oh
[1:21:27] no I'm nothing no the message of hour is
[1:21:30] trying to point you that who you
[1:21:33] are you are not a strer you are not a
[1:21:37] Jacob you are not a Believer you are a
[1:21:40] pre of
[1:21:43] godall God that's why he wristle and
[1:21:46] when he recognize and accept the message
[1:21:49] of the angel that you are a prince of
[1:21:52] God there is an evilness he was
[1:21:55] limping something changed when he
[1:21:58] received the message of the he was
[1:22:00] limping walking liming that's why when
[1:22:03] you receive the message of Y there must
[1:22:05] be a change in your
[1:22:07] life maybe not instantly but little by
[1:22:11] little little by little little by little
[1:22:14] without knowing it God is moving on the
[1:22:21] scene just like my Paul my son
[1:22:25] Paul every one of
[1:22:28] us experien turbulence in our life so he
[1:22:33] suffered depression one time in his life
[1:22:36] when he's still single he ster
[1:22:40] depression we went in the Philippines
[1:22:43] and we keep calling him and he's not
[1:22:45] answering the P so we are so concerned
[1:22:48] we know our
[1:22:49] son when he was will not he will not
[1:22:53] talk to us there would be
[1:22:56] something happening so we went back to
[1:22:59] here in the states and we tried to talk
[1:23:02] to him knocking the door he will not he
[1:23:05] will not talk to us he will not open the
[1:23:08] door no
[1:23:12] nothing but during service
[1:23:16] time he dress up went to the church and
[1:23:21] he's always in this post of Duty
[1:23:24] playing guitar as if nothing happened
[1:23:29] and when he go back home the same thing
[1:23:32] happened I say nothing happened he's
[1:23:35] just in his door knocking and we are so
[1:23:37] worried and sometimes we just leave it
[1:23:39] unto the Lord as long as still going to
[1:23:43] church there might be something there
[1:23:44] will be a change you may not know it but
[1:23:47] there is a change when you go in the
[1:23:49] house of the Lord hallelujah every
[1:23:51] Wednesday he's playing the song every
[1:23:54] Wednesday every Sunday he just playing
[1:23:56] the song even though he was in the stat
[1:23:58] of
[1:23:59] depression but God hallelujah God is
[1:24:02] rich in Mercy delivered him from
[1:24:07] depression because you can never be the
[1:24:09] same unless you go to the church you may
[1:24:12] suffer some lukewarmness as long as you
[1:24:15] are in the church there must be a change
[1:24:17] in your life so Jacob was limping and
[1:24:20] limping he always look at I am Jacob I
[1:24:23] am
[1:24:25] nobody but the angel keep telling no no
[1:24:27] no no Jacob you are not a supplanter
[1:24:30] praise God you are not the deceiver you
[1:24:33] are a prince of God hallelujah and Paul
[1:24:36] CED up and said even even before they
[1:24:39] were born Jacob I hate but you Jacob I
[1:24:44] have
[1:24:46] love this is the message of the
[1:24:49] hour so let us go back to my notes
[1:24:55] amen that's the good thing when you are
[1:24:57] pulling I
[1:24:59] am going out of my notes but thank God I
[1:25:02] can come back
[1:25:04] again and the Centon answered said Lord
[1:25:08] I am not worthy that thou shouldest come
[1:25:10] under my roof but speak the word only
[1:25:15] speak the word only cuz Gentile faith is
[1:25:19] speaking the word into the exist
[1:25:22] Hallelujah he was and the prophet said
[1:25:25] and but speak the word only and my
[1:25:28] servant shall be healed speak the word
[1:25:31] only Lord he knows that he was a
[1:25:36] centurion Hallelujah with authority and
[1:25:39] command over his soldiers one but they
[1:25:42] recognize Hallelujah a higher
[1:25:45] authority and he said that for I am a
[1:25:48] men under Authority having soldiers
[1:25:50] under me and I say to this man go and he
[1:25:53] goeth and to another come and he cometh
[1:25:56] and to my servant do this and he do it
[1:25:59] yes but he
[1:26:02] recognized a higher authority than
[1:26:05] himself right praise the Lord and even
[1:26:10] Jesus marvelled and when Jesus heard
[1:26:14] it confessing the word just speak the
[1:26:18] word only no interpretation no
[1:26:21] mislocation no misinterpretation of the
[1:26:23] word just speak the word
[1:26:31] only actually he was the one that's
[1:26:33] speaking just speak the word only and my
[1:26:37] servant will be healed he already
[1:26:39] finished confessing it Hallelujah God is
[1:26:43] only vindicating what he confessed just
[1:26:46] speak the word and my servant will be
[1:26:48] healed when he speak the word it was
[1:26:51] already
[1:26:52] done that's why Jesus Mar
[1:26:55] and Jesus heard it and marvelled and
[1:26:57] said to them that follow verily I say
[1:27:00] unto you I have not found so great faith
[1:27:03] know not in
[1:27:07] Israel
[1:27:08] Hallelujah faith in his
[1:27:12] word will
[1:27:14] bring his word to
[1:27:17] pass and he said in 18 and Jesus said
[1:27:21] unto the Centurion go thy way
[1:27:25] as thou H has believed so it was his
[1:27:28] faith in the word that healed the
[1:27:32] Centurion Jesus Christ has nothing to do
[1:27:35] with it because he said go thy way as
[1:27:38] thou Hast
[1:27:40] believed so be it done unto thee as thou
[1:27:45] believe so you whatever no matter what
[1:27:47] you are Hallelujah this morning just
[1:27:50] believe it because all the promises of
[1:27:52] God is just an amen way for him to
[1:27:55] fulfill it just say the word amen and my
[1:27:59] servant will be healed he was the one
[1:28:01] who say it amen and Jesus just confirm
[1:28:05] it Go thy way as thou Hast believed so
[1:28:08] it be done unto thee Hallelujah so your
[1:28:12] heart is where you believe from not
[1:28:15] because of your Sensation that you
[1:28:17] believe not because of of O any preacher
[1:28:22] that's so anointed that you believe no
[1:28:24] believing is from the
[1:28:26] heart because believing from the mind is
[1:28:29] just
[1:28:32] hope
[1:28:33] amen nothing wrong with that when you
[1:28:36] are
[1:28:37] hoping believing in the
[1:28:40] mind
[1:28:42] Hallelujah has the ability to reason
[1:28:46] that's
[1:28:47] right because if it will not come to
[1:28:51] pass you will reason against the word of
[1:28:53] God but believing from the heart there
[1:28:56] is no reasoning that's right only
[1:28:58] believe or doubt amen so we need to
[1:29:02] believe from the heart amen that
[1:29:04] everything is already being done
[1:29:07] deal amen right we ought to be happy you
[1:29:11] need to be inspired this morning we need
[1:29:13] to be inspired that our life that our
[1:29:15] God that we are serving is alive he is
[1:29:19] wien and he whatever he promised is
[1:29:21] going to fulfill it if you ask it in his
[1:29:26] name am that's so personal I will do
[1:29:31] it so that's why when we come into the
[1:29:33] house of the Lord expect the
[1:29:36] supernatural amen because whatever you
[1:29:40] asked and speak that's right he will
[1:29:44] confirm it if it is according to his
[1:29:47] word as the prophet said God will not be
[1:29:49] God un until he or or unless he fulfill
[1:29:53] what he promised amen right because the
[1:29:58] one who promised will be able to fulfill
[1:30:00] what he promised that's right or else he
[1:30:02] will not be God what a statement of repr
[1:30:05] from the Propet amen amen God is always
[1:30:08] in his word yes so we'll we'll
[1:30:16] continue
[1:30:18] Hallelujah but unto you that fear my
[1:30:21] name shall the son of righteousness
[1:30:25] arise with healings in his wing the son
[1:30:29] of righteousness there is no other
[1:30:31] greater light than the sun amen
[1:30:34] hallelujah and the light brings life and
[1:30:37] we and I believe the greatest light of
[1:30:39] all is the Sun and that is through the
[1:30:42] spoken word of God but in our generation
[1:30:45] the s o n once again rise up amen and he
[1:30:50] push away all the darkness of unbelief
[1:30:52] in our day the Sun
[1:30:54] of righteousness arise with healings in
[1:30:58] his wings notice not healing in his feet
[1:31:02] not healing in his knees not healing in
[1:31:05] his tight not healing in his shoulder
[1:31:07] not healing in his head but healing in
[1:31:10] his wings Hallelujah it is a bird and
[1:31:14] that bird happens to be a prophet amen
[1:31:17] hallelujah amen and the prophet of
[1:31:20] Malachi Paul is an eagle an eagle brings
[1:31:23] an anointing an eagle anointing brings
[1:31:27] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah and the
[1:31:30] Gates of Hell cannot prevails against it
[1:31:33] there is a healing in his
[1:31:38] wings he Wings the Alpha and the Omega
[1:31:45] the old and the New Testament there will
[1:31:48] be healing from Genesis to Revelation
[1:31:51] there will be healing because it said I
[1:31:53] am the Alpha and the Omega there is
[1:31:56] healing because I am the beginning and I
[1:31:58] will be the end so whatever situation
[1:32:02] you are in right now my brother and
[1:32:04] sisters Hallelujah he said that I am the
[1:32:07] Alpha and Omega there is healing in his

[1:32:27] wings the Alpha and the
[1:32:31] Omega so everything that happens our way
[1:32:34] in between the Alpha and
[1:32:38] Omega is just the
[1:32:41] icing of the
[1:32:43] cake you may have troubles you have made
[1:32:46] discouragement but whatever he set in
[1:32:49] the beginning he will achieve at the end
[1:32:53] Hallelujah no amount of shortcomings no
[1:32:56] amount of Trials no amount of Temptation
[1:32:58] can take away what was in his mind at
[1:33:00] the beginning because there is an
[1:33:02] healing Hallelujah in the land healing
[1:33:05] means restoration to your original
[1:33:08] position where is your original position
[1:33:11] in the mind and in the thought of God
[1:33:13] that's right he never thought about you
[1:33:15] being a sinner he never thought about
[1:33:17] you being discouraged he never thought
[1:33:19] about you being depressed he never
[1:33:21] thought about you something he thought
[1:33:23] about as perfect in his life he thought
[1:33:27] about you as blameless he thought about
[1:33:29] you as holy he thought about you he
[1:33:32] justified he thought about you glorified
[1:33:35] he thought about you
[1:33:39] Sanctified healing in his
[1:33:42] wings I am the Alpha and the Omega we
[1:33:46] need to recognize the Propet in the last
[1:33:48] night bring healing
[1:33:58] we say praise the Lord prise the
[1:34:04] Lord healing brings us back to our
[1:34:07] original condition this is what the
[1:34:10] message is all about bringing us back to
[1:34:14] our original condition in the
[1:34:17] beginning that's why the prophet is said
[1:34:19] in this last days the opening of The
[1:34:21] Seven SE to let you know who you are
[1:34:25] because if you know who you are where
[1:34:28] you came from you will know where you're
[1:34:31] going you need to
[1:34:33] recognize and this is the message of the
[1:34:35] hour we are not following a man we are
[1:34:38] not following a cult but we are
[1:34:40] following the pillar of fire that is
[1:34:41] here in our midst amen he is still the
[1:34:44] same God he is still the same Pillar of
[1:34:47] Fire that's right when the prophet is
[1:34:50] out of the scene the pillar of fire is
[1:34:52] still here amen that's why still the
[1:34:55] anointing of God is still Among Us the
[1:34:58] healing is Among Us
[1:35:01] healing is the aess that there is a
[1:35:05] changing of our body Hallelujah because
[1:35:08] the prophet said the first Vindication
[1:35:10] of my Ministry of prophet is Divine
[1:35:14] Healing and Divine Healing is the ear of
[1:35:18] the Resurrection The Ear of the
[1:35:21] rupture if you are sick and you are heal
[1:35:24] praise be to God hallelujah because that
[1:35:26] is the aess that there will be a body
[1:35:28] change one of these days or else
[1:35:31] hallelujah or else we are just following
[1:35:33] a a cult or church no we are following
[1:35:36] the pillar of fire in this life you may
[1:35:38] ask where is the god of
[1:35:40] Elijah the god of Elijah is here the god
[1:35:44] of Elijah is unfolding his word to each
[1:35:46] and every one of us that's why you are
[1:35:49] responding to the word of
[1:35:52] Elijah because God was in
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:56] Elijah you Lord and you shall go forth
[1:35:59] and grow as a Cals to the soul
[1:36:02] hallelujah
[1:36:03] hallelujah we need to go as a c we just
[1:36:07] drink
[1:36:10] milk we have stages in our lives we
[1:36:13] drink milk and sometimes we go to the ox
[1:36:16] we labor come to the face of a man and
[1:36:20] get wisdom but guess what we are now in
[1:36:23] the eagle
[1:36:25] Hallelujah and the eagle anointing is to
[1:36:27] let you know who you are just like when
[1:36:30] God created Adam in spirit form male and
[1:36:33] female created them and called their
[1:36:36] name Adam one name that's right so when
[1:36:41] God created Man Out of the Dust of the
[1:36:43] earth he pull out that fous spirit and
[1:36:46] form a body Hallelujah and when the
[1:36:49] woman come out she didn't know who he
[1:36:52] was she didn't know who she was right we
[1:36:57] don't know about the message of the hour
[1:36:59] we don't know who we are we don't know
[1:37:01] about serving God but it was God himself
[1:37:05] who brought Eve to Adam because Adam
[1:37:08] know who he is and he know who she was
[1:37:12] that's why when Eve come into him he
[1:37:14] said you are a
[1:37:17] woman because you are now bone of my
[1:37:19] bone and Flesh of My Flesh so that's why
[1:37:22] there is an eagal anointing in our day
[1:37:24] to let us know who we are we don't know
[1:37:27] who we are on that's right that's right
[1:37:31] that's why we enjoy so
[1:37:33] much the eagle story of our Prophet
[1:37:37] because we can relate by experience amen
[1:37:40] that we are born into this world we are
[1:37:42] born an eagle to begin
[1:37:44] with but we are born Hallelujah and
[1:37:48] there are more denominational brothers
[1:37:50] and
[1:37:51] sisters as we grow we act like like the
[1:37:54] same but there was something in our
[1:37:56] heart longing for something that's what
[1:37:58] the brother bam said when he preached
[1:38:00] the the the message God who is rich in
[1:38:02] Mercy when you are born in this world
[1:38:04] when you are still a little baby the
[1:38:06] seed of God was already in
[1:38:08] you if you are predestinated of God
[1:38:11] there is a representation in your life
[1:38:14] when you are still a little baby amen
[1:38:17] the seed was already in you and what is
[1:38:20] that seed The Germ of God the part word
[1:38:23] there's only one eternal life and that
[1:38:25] is God you must be a part of God in
[1:38:28] order to have eternal life so when you
[1:38:29] are still little B born in sin come to
[1:38:32] the word speaking life there is already
[1:38:34] a SE in
[1:38:36] you and when he comes grow he's
[1:38:40] wondering why there was a thirst there
[1:38:43] was a hungering seeking for God and he
[1:38:45] jumped from the Baptist Hall and cannot
[1:38:48] satisfy he jumped to the to the Jehovah
[1:38:51] Witness and there's nothing can satisfy
[1:38:53] he went to church from church to church
[1:38:55] longing to satisfy the no amount of
[1:38:59] church denomination can satisfi the thir
[1:39:03] then one day Hallelujah there is a
[1:39:05] message calling your name and you
[1:39:08] responded it and he said now I become
[1:39:11] Hallelujah a Son of God I was born in
[1:39:14] church in Branham but there was another
[1:39:17] one inside of me and when the word was
[1:39:20] squeaking into it he recognized I am
[1:39:24] another this is what the message is all
[1:39:26] about to let you know who you
[1:39:28] are that's why in our Eagle story he was
[1:39:32] the the the eagle was born and he's been
[1:39:35] with with a chicken he's eating what
[1:39:38] they he's just eating what the chicken
[1:39:40] is eating he jump from one fence Baptist
[1:39:45] fence then he jump to a Catholic fence
[1:39:48] then he jump to a church Pence then he
[1:39:50] jumped to a nazaran fence then he jump
[1:39:53] no no one can satisfy and he wonder
[1:39:56] why Hallelujah but in the days of the
[1:39:58] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:40:01] spread his wing there is healing in the
[1:40:04] land Hallelujah when the voice of the
[1:40:07] sary shouted that recognize the word
[1:40:11] hallelujah and he
[1:40:13] knows her
[1:40:16] destination so this is what the message
[1:40:18] is all about to let you know who you are
[1:40:21] sir that's why even though
[1:40:24] every worship you just heard about
[1:40:26] predestination about before the
[1:40:28] foundation what this this is what the
[1:40:29] message is all about if you don't know
[1:40:32] who you are where are you going if you
[1:40:35] think you are not predestinated where
[1:40:37] are you going if you think you are not
[1:40:40] ordained before the foundation of where
[1:40:42] are you
[1:40:43] going who can satisfy your
[1:40:46] thirst that's why predestination is so
[1:40:48] important thing because your life is
[1:40:51] already destined to be in the presence
[1:40:54] of the Lord he is the alpha and he is
[1:40:56] the Omega what he start or set in the
[1:40:59] beginning he will finish it at the
[1:41:05] end that's why we are a finished product
[1:41:07] of
[1:41:09] God God could not be God Without You
[1:41:12] amen because you are a true worshipper
[1:41:14] of God there are a lot of worshippers
[1:41:17] but they don't know what they're
[1:41:19] worshiping at but since we have the
[1:41:21] opening of The Seven Seals we know who
[1:41:23] God was then we become a genuine
[1:41:26] worshiper unto God hallelujah God will
[1:41:29] not be God without
[1:41:31] you because you are created to worship
[1:41:35] him to reflect his
[1:41:39] character
[1:41:44] Hallelujah that's why
[1:41:46] predestination is a sacred word
[1:41:50] am you recognize
[1:41:53] where you came from and it will give you
[1:41:58] strength with joy to continue I am not
[1:42:02] an ordinary man I am
[1:42:04] predestinated Hallelujah unto adoption
[1:42:08] that is there no way Hallelujah that can
[1:42:11] get up because when the spirit of God
[1:42:14] comes in you he will seal you until the
[1:42:17] day of your Redemption do you agree it
[1:42:22] if you are sealed you cannot be
[1:42:24] unsealed because you are sealed until
[1:42:27] the day of your
[1:42:28] Redemption you can experience in extreme
[1:42:32] turbulence in your life you may have ups
[1:42:35] and downs to trial and testing
[1:42:37] depression
[1:42:39] complexity but it will never unseal what
[1:42:42] God has already
[1:42:44] sealed because you are sealed until the
[1:42:47] day of your Redemption you are still the
[1:42:49] day the day of the changing over your
[1:42:51] body
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:43:00] hu if you are not enjoying the message
[1:43:03] of the hour you need to go to church
[1:43:06] more and
[1:43:07] more because Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:43:10] that hearing by the word of God if you
[1:43:12] don't recognize your name you need to be
[1:43:14] in an
[1:43:16] incubator to feel the
[1:43:19] temperature Amen to feel the temperature
[1:43:22] to break the shell let you recognize
[1:43:26] Hallelujah because the breaking of the
[1:43:27] shell of your neck is not from the
[1:43:29] outside it must be the inside with the
[1:43:31] right
[1:43:32] temperature of the presence of God you
[1:43:34] need to be in the incubator of God
[1:43:39] amen
[1:43:41] amen that's why if you don't say Amen or
[1:43:44] Rejoice I'm not
[1:43:46] discouraged amen I am preaching to
[1:43:50] those who can receive the word and enjoy
[1:43:53] it but if you are not enjoying
[1:43:59] it God bless
[1:44:02] you one of these days you will enjoy
[1:44:07] it because if you keep coming to church
[1:44:10] keep coming to church God is doing
[1:44:13] something Supernatural in your life
[1:44:15] hallelujah what of this day some of you
[1:44:17] that are not baptized will come into the
[1:44:19] presence of the Lord Lord I want to be
[1:44:20] baptized Hallelujah God is in the making
[1:44:24] God is still in the business of calling
[1:44:26] those whose name are written in the
[1:44:27] Lamb's Book of Life this is the time of
[1:44:31] recognizing our day this is the time of
[1:44:33] recognizing our day recognizing the amen
[1:44:37] the presence of the
[1:44:39] Lord
[1:44:45] Lord
[1:44:46] [Music]
[1:44:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:53] amen so let us another add one dose of
[1:45:01] booster amen that's brother Rong let us
[1:45:04] put a mega
[1:45:07] do of the
[1:45:09] spiritual vitamins in this last
[1:45:12] Revelation chapter 1 or chapter 9 I
[1:45:17] verse 1-2
[1:45:23] and the fif Angel sounded there so there
[1:45:26] is an angel a fif Angel sounded and I
[1:45:28] saw a star fall from Heaven andto the
[1:45:31] Earth so that's why we can see the
[1:45:32] falling stars so an angel is a
[1:45:36] messenger a falling
[1:45:38] star and to him was given the key of the
[1:45:43] bottomless pit so this Fallen star
[1:45:46] Fallen Angel was given the key to open
[1:45:49] the bottomless pit and he opened the
[1:45:53] bottomless pit and there arose smoke out
[1:45:56] of the pit as the smoke of great furnace
[1:45:59] and the Sun and the air were darkened by
[1:46:02] reason of the smoke of the pit so we can
[1:46:05] see Revelation 9 verse 1-2 we seldom
[1:46:09] hear about it being preached but as
[1:46:12] Prophet said the opening of the
[1:46:14] bottomless pit releases the fourth
[1:46:17] dimension of
[1:46:18] Science and Technology upon the people
[1:46:22] that would eventually give them access
[1:46:24] to hell where Revelation 10 verse one
[1:46:27] the mighty angel coming out give us
[1:46:30] access into heaven so hell and heaven is
[1:46:34] here at the same time that's right
[1:46:36] speaking about the dimension as the
[1:46:38] prophet said there are seven Dimension
[1:46:40] the First Dimension is light Hallelujah
[1:46:43] let there be light and light brings life
[1:46:47] yes and the second in
[1:46:49] Time and Time began when he fall because
[1:46:54] the prophet said the day you eat thereof
[1:46:56] the day you shall die before that there
[1:46:59] is no time
[1:47:01] limit that's why Adam have fellowship
[1:47:03] with God every time God came down in the
[1:47:06] cool of the evening and and open the
[1:47:09] truth to Adam Adam just say Amen
[1:47:12] Lord amen Lord he don't interpret he
[1:47:15] don't mislocate he this misconstrue the
[1:47:18] word he just amen Lord amen Lord amen
[1:47:21] Lord and he ended up with hallelujah
[1:47:25] amen amen that is our Heavenly
[1:47:29] language whatever country you are in and
[1:47:33] whatever language you are being preached
[1:47:36] to you respond with the same amen amen
[1:47:41] and
[1:47:42] Hallelujah because amen means so be it
[1:47:46] and Hallelujah means praise the
[1:47:49] Lord hallelujah so that's why every time
[1:47:52] there is a Fellowship just say
[1:47:55] Amen if you are a Believer practice
[1:47:58] saying
[1:48:00] amen
[1:48:02] amen amen because only those who
[1:48:06] experience Redemption rejoice in the
[1:48:09] presence of the
[1:48:11] Lord we have
[1:48:14] angels that is in Camp round about us
[1:48:18] amen so if we have a vacant seat
[1:48:23] be sure that there was Angel in there
[1:48:25] amen and the more you praise God yes the
[1:48:29] angel will look at it what are the aing
[1:48:34] at because he didn't experience
[1:48:37] salvation so that just
[1:48:40] look that's why there are three kinds of
[1:48:43] people those who make things happen can
[1:48:46] say Amen to every word and those who
[1:48:49] watch things happen and those who are
[1:48:52] wondering what
[1:48:56] happened I hope you are not one of these
[1:49:00] three Hallelujah so that's why when we
[1:49:03] come into the house of the Lord we will
[1:49:06] force you am we will force you to say
[1:49:08] Amen we will force you to say hallelujah
[1:49:11] amen not to deal on your emotion but the
[1:49:14] word is being spread that's why Adam say
[1:49:18] Amen Lord amen
[1:49:20] Lord amen Lord am amen Lord that's why
[1:49:24] Angel know nothing's about it that's
[1:49:27] right right because they were SED
[1:49:32] right to be a
[1:49:34] guardian they were in Camp round about
[1:49:36] us yes so when the word is being
[1:49:40] preached and you don't
[1:49:42] respond you will look like an
[1:49:48] angel because angels Don't response to
[1:49:51] the word
[1:49:55] Angel just wondering
[1:49:58] why are you an angel this morning or you
[1:50:01] are Sons and Daughters of God if you are
[1:50:04] Sons and Daughters of God you need to
[1:50:05] claim it shout it praise
[1:50:09] it don't be ashamed that you are Sons
[1:50:11] and Daughters of God hallelujah because
[1:50:14] God dwells in the presence of his people
[1:50:16] when you say shout when you say Amen
[1:50:18] when you say hallelujah the more you
[1:50:21] will feel presence of the
[1:50:26] Lord we need to be grateful of what he
[1:50:29] has done for us the more we become
[1:50:33] thankful the more blessings to
[1:50:35] come you cannot be
[1:50:38] unsealed when you are
[1:50:42] sealed thank you
[1:50:45] Jesus prise the Lord we Are Not Angels
[1:50:49] We Are Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[1:50:52] that's right
[1:50:53] although there were time that we become
[1:50:58] silent as brother R said it's better
[1:51:00] than you are silen it means you are
[1:51:06] listening but make sure that you're
[1:51:08] listening right make sure that you are
[1:51:11] not
[1:51:13] murmuring make sure that you are not
[1:51:16] saying something against somebody
[1:51:20] else because your action speaks louder
[1:51:23] than your word amen make sure that
[1:51:26] you're praising God make sure when you
[1:51:28] are silent you are listening to the word
[1:51:30] of God Amen because the spirit is moving
[1:51:33] the spirit is speaking he that had an
[1:51:36] ear let him hear what the spirit said
[1:51:39] unto the
[1:51:43] churches amen Revelation 1 verse1 and he
[1:51:46] opened the bottomless pit and there AR
[1:51:49] Rose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke
[1:51:51] of great fur and the Sun and the air so
[1:51:54] First Dimension is light second
[1:51:56] dimension Hallelujah is time and third
[1:51:59] dimension is matter and mass matters
[1:52:02] amen the fourth dimension is science and
[1:52:05] technology that's why when they open
[1:52:08] when they open the bottomless pit there
[1:52:10] was there came a fourth
[1:52:12] dimension that we see on the television
[1:52:15] we see it there they exist that's why
[1:52:18] all the movies that we that has been
[1:52:20] showing all around us where did they get
[1:52:23] that
[1:52:25] inspiration inspiration to create a
[1:52:27] monster inspiration to have
[1:52:32] mass murder inspiration for mass
[1:52:35] destruction where did that inspiration
[1:52:38] come
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:40] from thank you when the fourth dimension
[1:52:43] was being released even the so-call
[1:52:47] Believers are being
[1:52:49] affected all those games they not just
[1:52:53] game they are inspiration coming from
[1:52:55] the bottomless pit and they are trying
[1:52:58] to draw your attentions away from the
[1:53:00] word of God you spend sometimes all the
[1:53:03] young people even the old people spend
[1:53:06] their time and effort praise God even
[1:53:08] money to play the games yes where did
[1:53:13] that inspiration come
[1:53:16] from you see the bottomless speed is
[1:53:19] open that's why all the immorality all
[1:53:23] there is anointing that is being
[1:53:24] released the anointing to make all the
[1:53:28] people disbel to the word of
[1:53:31] God that's why when you feel
[1:53:33] lukewarmness there must be something do
[1:53:36] you need to check you feel the
[1:53:40] coldness as brother Ron where what are
[1:53:43] you feeding
[1:53:45] at why you feel youor why you feel so
[1:53:49] cold what are you eating at
[1:53:54] amen
[1:53:55] amen when the seal was
[1:53:58] open Revelation 10:1 the access to tree
[1:54:02] of life was open we can feed on the tree
[1:54:06] of life and the tree of life is no other
[1:54:08] the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:54:10] he said I am the
[1:54:12] life and the truth and my word there
[1:54:16] spirit and their life the heaven is
[1:54:19] open why spend your time in the
[1:54:22] bottomless pit inspiration the Hollywood
[1:54:25] the fashion of the word all the magazine
[1:54:28] all the movies that we see look around
[1:54:30] us yes it's all about murder violence
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:39] rape that's why you are wondering why I
[1:54:41] am so
[1:54:45] lukor why is my my family is not intact
[1:54:49] why is it what are you feeding on Amen
[1:54:52] don't waste your
[1:54:56] time right seeking on those things of
[1:55:00] the
[1:55:04] world no one will glory you if you win
[1:55:07] the games they will give you a million
[1:55:11] if you win for example then after that
[1:55:14] if you have no character you will spend
[1:55:16] it just one day then you become a beggar
[1:55:19] again
[1:55:23] what can you get from feeding on this
[1:55:25] world you are feeding praise God on the
[1:55:28] bottomless P this we being
[1:55:30] open right that's why brother Ron is so
[1:55:35] balanced because some of us especially
[1:55:37] young people even the old
[1:55:41] people yes they spend their time for
[1:55:44] nothing for
[1:55:46] games amen what are your game
[1:55:53] sometime the games are zomie and you're
[1:55:56] trying to win you're trying to win a
[1:55:57] city all kind of you know that you're
[1:56:00] not strange about it but I want you to
[1:56:03] know that it comes from the inspiration
[1:56:05] of the bottomless
[1:56:07] pit because there was an angel falling
[1:56:09] down with a open with a with a key in
[1:56:12] his hand to open every time they
[1:56:16] open there is anointing released to pull
[1:56:19] you away from believing the word of God
[1:56:22] to pull you away to pull your attention
[1:56:25] away from the word of God wherein the
[1:56:27] tree of life is open that you have
[1:56:29] boldness and access to enter in why
[1:56:32] don't you eat from the tree of life
[1:56:34] because the more you eat the more you
[1:56:36] become what you eat and one of these
[1:56:39] days praise God when you e so much the
[1:56:41] word the word will control your
[1:56:43] flesh and you will become like K amen
[1:56:48] and he was not Hallelujah because the
[1:56:51] word that is
[1:56:53] feeling translate
[1:56:56] him and no one seen him because he was
[1:57:00] not but he has a testimony before his
[1:57:04] translation that he pleased
[1:57:07] God you can only please God by believing
[1:57:11] his word in this last day amen you
[1:57:13] cannot please God by how much desire you
[1:57:15] serve God that is good but make sure
[1:57:18] your desire is on the basis of the word
[1:57:21] of God some you desire it on your own
[1:57:24] way just like Kane was his desire is to
[1:57:27] worship
[1:57:28] God he was sincere is Desiring God and
[1:57:32] in fact the scriptures say he offered a
[1:57:35] sacrifice excellent sacrifice yes
[1:57:41] amen nothing wrong with your
[1:57:44] desire but the problem Cain has no
[1:57:47] problem with worshiping God he worshiped
[1:57:50] with all his heart with all his mind
[1:57:52] mind but his problem was it's not how to
[1:57:57] worship but his problem was he wants to
[1:58:00] do to do it in his own way right even
[1:58:05] after God revealed to him if you follow
[1:58:08] what your brother is
[1:58:10] doing I will accept your
[1:58:12] sacrifice but he is doing it his own way
[1:58:16] make sure if you desire from your heart
[1:58:18] it comes from the word of God because if
[1:58:20] you are predestinated and Su oh I am
[1:58:22] predestinated I can do whatever I want I
[1:58:25] can do to anywhere I can go to I can go
[1:58:28] to the to the the bar or so I can do
[1:58:30] whatever I want so I'm telling you if
[1:58:34] that is your thinking that is that comes
[1:58:36] from a bottomless
[1:58:40] pit because the prophet said there was a
[1:58:43] question oh brother if I am
[1:58:45] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:58:47] the word I can do whatever I want and
[1:58:49] the prophet say sure you can do whatever
[1:58:51] you want
[1:58:52] but I guarantee you you will never
[1:58:54] decide to commit sin because if you are
[1:58:57] born again the seed of God is in you you
[1:58:59] will never decide to commit sin you
[1:59:02] become a new Creator so if are thinking
[1:59:04] is I can do whatever I want I want to do
[1:59:06] this I want to do no just like when when
[1:59:09] Peter said I want to build you another
[1:59:10] Temple and the Lord said get behind thee
[1:59:14] get behind me
[1:59:16] Satan amen so we need to make sure that
[1:59:20] our desire is in the word of God because
[1:59:23] if you are predestinated you have no
[1:59:26] other way but to come to the Fulfillment
[1:59:29] of where you are predestinated to be
[1:59:32] thank you Lord you are predestinated
[1:59:34] unto adoption you will be sitting upon
[1:59:37] the throne of God remember in the Book
[1:59:39] of Revelation chapter
[1:59:42] 4 when the angels have come up a little
[1:59:45] bit higher come up here John and I will
[1:59:49] show you things to come it is a type of
[1:59:51] the that the spirit of God Is Lifting Up
[1:59:53] into a prophetic fulfillment of his word
[1:59:57] and God show him there was a door open
[2:00:01] in lysia there was a closed door yes
[2:00:04] that's why God is knocking he is trying
[2:00:06] to enter but when the spirit of God said
[2:00:09] come up a little bit higher John There
[2:00:12] Was An Open Door amen hallelujah there
[2:00:15] is an Open Door for the Bride of Jesus
[2:00:17] Christ the door to the throne of God and
[2:00:20] there he saw 24 sitting around the
[2:00:24] throne and he saw these 12
[2:00:27] angels 12 Patriarchs and 12 Apostle
[2:00:30] while John was in the spirit Hallelujah
[2:00:33] he already
[2:00:34] saw the 12 partch and 12 Apostles
[2:00:38] sitting on the
[2:00:41] throne the prophetic
[2:00:45] Ministry the prophetic
[2:00:47] Vision let him know that he was already
[2:00:51] sitting on the
[2:00:54] throne even though he is still in the
[2:00:56] Patmos Vision in the Patmos island of
[2:00:58] Patmos but the vision that is being
[2:01:00] lifted up a prophetic Ministry show him
[2:01:04] AOS Hallelujah that he is now sitting in
[2:01:06] the throne with the 12 part and 12 abos
[2:01:10] he saw his self in the throne amen this
[2:01:14] is what the prophetic Ministry is about
[2:01:16] to tell you where you are and where you
[2:01:19] came from to tell you your position
[2:01:22] that's
[2:01:23] right
[2:01:27] am Revelation 10 1 verse2 and I saw
[2:01:31] another Mighty Angel come down so the
[2:01:33] fifth angel come down from heaven with
[2:01:35] an
[2:01:38] open with a key to open the bottomless
[2:01:41] pit but this is another Angel and I saw
[2:01:44] another Mighty Angel come down from
[2:01:46] heaven cloth with a
[2:01:47] cloud Hallelujah the cloud of Witnesses
[2:01:53] amen and a rainbow was upon his head and
[2:01:56] his face was as it were the sun you see
[2:02:00] the sun always represent the greater
[2:02:02] light amen and his feet as pillars of
[2:02:07] fire here we are
[2:02:10] again
[2:02:13] judgment and mercy coming at the same
[2:02:17] time and he had in his hand a little
[2:02:19] book open so when that this is open book
[2:02:23] in in Revelation 4 it is a closed book
[2:02:25] but here hallelujah it is an open book
[2:02:30] yes that's why we need to know that's
[2:02:33] why the opening of The Seven seal the
[2:02:36] open book is just being preach and
[2:02:39] preach all over again because you need
[2:02:42] to recognize who you are amen hallelujah
[2:02:45] it is not just like just quoting
[2:02:47] scripture and quoting scripture it must
[2:02:49] be personal experience that you
[2:02:52] recognize your name in the book and we
[2:02:55] say that what is this name what what
[2:02:57] what is the name for it is your name
[2:03:00] Hallelujah when you recognize the
[2:03:02] message that was sent in your day and
[2:03:04] you responded by Revelation this is your
[2:03:07] name being called in this last day
[2:03:08] Hallelujah that's why it is so important
[2:03:11] to know our position in the book
[2:03:14] amen examine amen there is no turning
[2:03:18] back amen
[2:03:23] Hallelujah and he had in his little book
[2:03:26] had a little book
[2:03:28] open and he said his right foot upon the
[2:03:31] sea and his left foot upon the
[2:03:34] Earth Revelation 9:1 giving people
[2:03:37] access to Hell through the technology of
[2:03:39] televisions and internet and that access
[2:03:42] is what bringing that Dimension into
[2:03:44] this dimension of the world that we live
[2:03:48] in what we are looking all around us
[2:03:52] came from that fourth dimension of Hell
[2:04:00] amen but Revelation 101 and2 the opening
[2:04:03] of the seventh Dimension which is giving
[2:04:05] us access to eat of the tree of life so
[2:04:08] the seventh Dimension is where the Lord
[2:04:11] got
[2:04:13] us that's why when the prophet is only a
[2:04:16] seventh
[2:04:17] grade he came his knowledge from the
[2:04:19] seventh dimension of God in the days of
[2:04:22] the voice of the seventh angel a seventh
[2:04:26] grade and seventh Dimension is the
[2:04:29] seventh Dimension where God is so the
[2:04:32] message that we are feeding on is not
[2:04:34] the message of a man it is the message
[2:04:37] of God from the seventh Dimension given
[2:04:39] to us you are feeding on the
[2:04:43] life word the bread of life of God in
[2:04:45] this last days giving us access into the
[2:04:49] Tree of Life once again and when we walk
[2:04:52] into that light because there is no
[2:04:54] other greater light than the Sun and in
[2:04:56] this resurrect time time at this rising
[2:04:58] of the sun there is a rising of the S
[2:05:00] oom to give life unto the children of
[2:05:03] God so let Keep On
[2:05:05] Walking keep walking on the light
[2:05:08] Hallelujah keep walking on the light
[2:05:10] until the day that the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:05:13] will change your mortal body into
[2:05:15] Immortal just keep walking in the light
[2:05:18] there may be persecution while you are
[2:05:20] walking with God persecution from your
[2:05:22] work persecution from your family
[2:05:25] persecution from anyone else persecu but
[2:05:27] keep walking
[2:05:28] on keep it on walking on because you
[2:05:31] have the sure word of Prophecy in this
[2:05:34] last day the word is being Vindicated
[2:05:36] all over the word just keep on walking
[2:05:39] if they say against it just keep on
[2:05:42] walking until Enoch was
[2:05:46] not hallelujah amen one of this day we
[2:05:49] will walk in and we will be watching
[2:05:54] not it's already happened and it will
[2:05:57] continue to happen because he is the
[2:06:00] same yesterday today and
[2:06:03] forever and Revelation 10:7 is the
[2:06:06] seventh seal Redemption message of Grace
[2:06:09] and it is the title deed of redemption
[2:06:11] being turned and Back Again
[2:06:14] amen oh we so enjoy praise God just like

[2:06:21] God

[2:06:46] the Garden in my thought I'm going that
[2:06:49] way then in the split second he was

[2:10:47] salvation was before the foundation of
[2:10:49] the world and 2,000 years ago God
[2:10:51] fulfill it because no one can do it no
