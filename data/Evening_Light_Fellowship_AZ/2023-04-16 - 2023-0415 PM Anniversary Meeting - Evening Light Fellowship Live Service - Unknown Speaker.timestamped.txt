[59:48] for 30 years an anniversary of God
[59:52] having done something here in the
[59:54] Maricopa Valley
[59:56] and everything that I uh just a little
[59:59] personal testimony
[1:00:01] 1987 while I was in the Black Forest the
[1:00:05] schwarzvallet
[1:00:06] in Germany
[1:00:09] it was there I went down to hear Brother
[1:00:11] Lonnie Jenkins so I could hear somebody
[1:00:12] preach in English
[1:00:14] went down there and uh
[1:00:17] I had been sent over by Brother Floyd
[1:00:19] Patterson who was our pastor at that
[1:00:22] time from Flagstaff he was also when
[1:00:24] brother Roy borders died he took over
[1:00:27] spoken word Publications
[1:00:29] and he had asked my wife and I if we
[1:00:32] would move to Germany to start the first
[1:00:36] Outreach of spoken word Publication
[1:00:39] books anywhere in the world and if we
[1:00:42] would move to Europe to do it and we
[1:00:43] said we would do that we moved there in
[1:00:45] 1984.
[1:00:48] and we packed up everything took our
[1:00:51] three kids we thought we'd homeschool
[1:00:53] them found out you cannot homeschool in
[1:00:55] Germany you had to send them to school
[1:00:58] and so all three of our kids had to
[1:01:00] learn German we didn't know nothing
[1:01:02] about German not yeah you know we didn't
[1:01:05] know any Expressions you know and so we
[1:01:12] we were there in 1984 and after about a
[1:01:16] year and a half brother Joseph Branham
[1:01:18] when he had took over uh spoken word
[1:01:22] Publications you all you the older ones
[1:01:25] the older ones you'll remember in order
[1:01:27] to get the books you had to write to
[1:01:29] spoken word Publications and there you
[1:01:31] got the books and then if you wanted
[1:01:34] tapes you had to write to Fred softman
[1:01:36] who was in Tucson at the time to get the
[1:01:39] tapes well when Brother Joseph uh took
[1:01:42] over when Brother Floyd went ahead and
[1:01:44] and gave it over to Joseph it wound up
[1:01:47] that uh we changed it from spoken
[1:01:50] republications to voice of God
[1:01:53] Recordings and Brother Joseph and
[1:01:55] brother Billy Paul came over and they
[1:01:58] inherited the work that we were already
[1:02:00] doing and Brother Joseph said would you
[1:02:03] stay on for about another six months and
[1:02:05] then I will get somebody to replace you
[1:02:07] and yes that's fine we're uh we are
[1:02:11] American and and Germany's not our home
[1:02:13] is very very hard for uh you if you're
[1:02:17] living in a foreign country and you
[1:02:18] don't speak uh the language and my wife
[1:02:22] especially going to go to the grocery
[1:02:24] store if it doesn't have a picture on
[1:02:26] the can you you can't figure out what's
[1:02:29] in it is it green beans or carrots or
[1:02:32] whatever you know and so the lord gave
[1:02:35] us Grace and we were what turned from
[1:02:39] six months was for another
[1:02:42] three and a half years
[1:02:44] so from 84 to 89 we were there in
[1:02:47] Germany and while we were over there the
[1:02:50] Lord allowed us to
[1:02:53] um
[1:02:54] to speak in many of the churches I think
[1:02:56] in the five years that we were there we
[1:02:59] missed only two Sundays in five years of
[1:03:03] not being in church somewhere
[1:03:05] we traveled an average of about five to
[1:03:08] five and a half hours One Direction
[1:03:10] every Sunday to go to church my children
[1:03:13] lived in the car with us because it's
[1:03:16] traveling every every Sunday and so it
[1:03:19] was but in part of that
[1:03:23] um
[1:03:23] brother Hermann ringen who was up in
[1:03:27] Balkan Veda up in Northern Germany
[1:03:29] between Hamburg and and Bremen they had
[1:03:33] a little Farmhouse up there and brother
[1:03:36] Andreas he gave his testimony this
[1:03:38] morning of of a little bit
[1:03:42] um of what had happened up there but
[1:03:44] long story short it wound up we were
[1:03:47] having meetings and this is about almost
[1:03:49] 38 years ago
[1:03:51] or so that the Lord allowed us to be
[1:03:54] over there when Sandy and I went over
[1:03:56] there how old was I Sandy at 32
[1:03:58] something like that 32 years old
[1:04:01] just a young
[1:04:03] Punk
[1:04:06] it's a young kid you know but loved God
[1:04:09] and and was over there and and anyway it
[1:04:13] wound up there's been several times in
[1:04:15] my life that God has given me a vision
[1:04:19] and
[1:04:20] one of the times that God gave me a
[1:04:22] vision we were at The Farmhouse which is
[1:04:26] brother andreas's Father's Farm
[1:04:29] there in Germany and um I woke that
[1:04:33] morning I saw a vision I broke into a
[1:04:35] vision never had had one before
[1:04:38] and I saw it perfectly I saw myself
[1:04:41] preaching I saw the the way the young
[1:04:44] people were sitting and everything and I
[1:04:48] heard what sermon I was preaching now
[1:04:50] you have to understand when you young
[1:04:52] people when you heard his testimony
[1:04:54] today that's the first time I've heard
[1:04:57] it from his side
[1:05:00] I've always told it from my side and we
[1:05:02] know that God works on both ends does he
[1:05:04] not if God is dealing with one he's
[1:05:07] dealing with another it's not just a
[1:05:09] one-sided thing and so we were there
[1:05:13] broke into this Vision I told my wife
[1:05:15] about it I was excited but when I
[1:05:18] stepped into that Farmhouse that day I
[1:05:22] stepped into the vision
[1:05:24] I want you to understand when you step
[1:05:26] in and you see something and it's
[1:05:28] exactly
[1:05:30] what you saw it is empowering
[1:05:34] I can't tell you uh it's empowering and
[1:05:39] so I knew I I said God here it is this
[1:05:41] exactly uh as it was in a
[1:05:46] I went and I began preaching and now you
[1:05:49] have to understand I don't know the the
[1:05:50] young people I have no idea who sued and
[1:05:53] their lives
[1:05:56] and as The Story Goes brother Andreas
[1:05:59] raised in a Christian message believe in
[1:06:02] family but they had no church no Pastor
[1:06:05] up there and you know how it is young
[1:06:07] people they start growing up they start
[1:06:09] going wrong direction long story short
[1:06:10] here he is a young boy struggling
[1:06:14] and he needed something for God
[1:06:18] to put something in his life because he
[1:06:21] loved God he just didn't know how to
[1:06:23] serve him and he said God I need you to
[1:06:26] speak to me and he says if you'll have
[1:06:28] brother Ron to call me out
[1:06:31] now Imagine This
[1:06:34] and here I am in this vision and in this
[1:06:37] vision
[1:06:38] I can see this young man he's back and
[1:06:42] uh
[1:06:43] I I call him out I said brother stand up
[1:06:46] and say you love the Lord
[1:06:50] and the three sis four sisters that were
[1:06:53] sitting right here up in the front very
[1:06:55] close to me
[1:06:57] and they turned around to see who it was
[1:06:59] well he's probably excuse me but the
[1:07:02] worst young person in the group
[1:07:05] and these girls start snickering like
[1:07:08] boy if this pastor ever that well I
[1:07:11] wasn't a pastor then I just a preacher
[1:07:13] boy if this preacher ever made a mistake
[1:07:15] you blew it your discernment's way off
[1:07:17] man this guy ain't gonna say nothing
[1:07:20] he got up and
[1:07:22] has his testimony is it was exactly what
[1:07:26] he had prayed for and God called him out
[1:07:28] and here we are all these years later
[1:07:31] and I was so blessed this morning and if
[1:07:34] you all get an opportunity and you want
[1:07:36] to to hear the testimony of what God did
[1:07:39] on his part
[1:07:41] you go it's already archived on our our
[1:07:44] website there but um it wound up that
[1:07:48] there began a work even among the young
[1:07:52] people throughout Europe and that
[1:07:53] Revival fire has never died down
[1:07:57] and when God does something he does it
[1:08:00] well
[1:08:01] somebody give him praise tonight
[1:08:09] and so I just want to say that I am
[1:08:13] so pleased tonight to be associated with
[1:08:17] the greatest people on the face of the
[1:08:19] Earth the people that believe the
[1:08:22] message of Malachi 4.
[1:08:26] amen this you did not go looking for
[1:08:29] this message this message came looking
[1:08:31] for you
[1:08:34] brother Branham said you do not seek God
[1:08:36] God seeks you if God has ever called you
[1:08:39] if he's ever uh uh Gone looking for you
[1:08:42] let me tell you God is better than any
[1:08:44] RCMP God gets his man amen and his woman
[1:08:50] amen so we're just so very very pleased
[1:08:53] this evening to have all of you
[1:08:56] so in
[1:08:57] 1987 there in the black forest
[1:09:01] of Germany and I had spoke to brother
[1:09:04] Lonnie Jenkins I said brother Lonnie I
[1:09:07] don't know what to do
[1:09:09] I said I I am not German I don't feel to
[1:09:12] stay here this is not my country
[1:09:15] and I said God
[1:09:17] you need to do something and brother
[1:09:19] Lonnie he told me and if any of you knew
[1:09:22] him he was a very wise man he measured
[1:09:25] his words he said brother Ron I've never
[1:09:27] seen a young man like yourself into a
[1:09:30] position but what God is fixing to place
[1:09:33] him he said neutralize yourself
[1:09:35] to the will of God and he says God will
[1:09:38] place you
[1:09:39] a day or two later as I'm walking
[1:09:41] through the forest there in beaselsburg
[1:09:44] the Holy Spirit very very
[1:09:47] genuinely sincerely spoke to my heart I
[1:09:51] knew it I knew it was God and he says go
[1:09:54] to Phoenix and start a church
[1:09:58] that was 1987. I didn't get here until
[1:10:01] 92 but God knows just what he's doing
[1:10:05] he's got everything prepared amen and as
[1:10:08] we drove into the City Pioneer Road you
[1:10:11] guys North no Pioneer Road up here just
[1:10:14] north of town my son Amos and I were
[1:10:17] riding in the car together Sandy and the
[1:10:20] other two kids in the other vehicle in
[1:10:23] front of us and I said I want to pull
[1:10:25] into

[1:10:30] Amos and I got out
[1:10:31] and I went out into the desert and I

[1:10:37] I have gone I went to Silsbee Texas for
[1:10:40] you Lord
[1:10:41] I said it was for a man because he asked
[1:10:44] me to go

[1:10:48] to Europe because a man asked me to go
[1:10:53] and I said but father I am coming by a
[1:10:56] Divine vision
[1:10:58] and a word that you have spoke to me to

[1:20:03] and this evening I want to speak on a on
[1:20:05] a little subject on Dedicated To Worship
[1:20:09] and uh I again I want to speak on
[1:20:11] dedication uh which uh but the
[1:20:14] dedication to worship not only
[1:20:16] dedication for worship but dedicated to
[1:20:20] worship because we are here to worship
[1:20:25] amen that's why we are here we are here
[1:20:28] to worship
[1:20:30] amen and God wants to be worshiped
[1:20:34] amen and by the grace of the lord we
[1:20:37] want to a little bit enlarge the the
[1:20:41] subject of worship
[1:20:44] amen because I believe it's uh it's such
[1:20:47] a vital thing today you worship anyhow
[1:20:51] amen so better worship Him
[1:20:57] amen so dedicated
[1:20:59] to worship
[1:21:01] second chronicles we want to read from
[1:21:03] the 5th chapter 13 and 14. we want to
[1:21:07] read and you know it's very actually
[1:21:08] known scripture of the dedication of the
[1:21:10] temple and we just jump into the middle
[1:21:12] of the Bible and we maybe try to go a
[1:21:15] little later from before the foundation
[1:21:18] of the world from the beginning how
[1:21:20] things really developed and I tell you
[1:21:22] this is the way you are developing
[1:21:27] so we have to start just in the middle
[1:21:29] of it just to start somewhere okay
[1:21:32] second chronicles uh 5 13 and it came to
[1:21:35] pass even as the trumpeters and singers
[1:21:37] whereas one to make one sound to be
[1:21:40] heard in praising and thanking the lord
[1:21:42] and when they lifted up their voices
[1:21:44] with the trumpets and symbols and
[1:21:46] instruments of music and praise the Lord
[1:21:49] saying for he is God for his Mercy
[1:21:52] endures forever that then the house was
[1:21:56] filled with the cloud even the house of
[1:21:58] the Lord so that the priest could not
[1:22:01] stand to minister by reason of the cloud
[1:22:04] for the glory of the Lord had filled the
[1:22:07] house of God
[1:22:09] amen what a wonderful thing that is amen
[1:22:12] and then then watch because I think this
[1:22:15] is this is very remarkable then we want
[1:22:17] to read from chapter 6 verse 1.
[1:22:20] and because now Solomon Solomon now is
[1:22:23] starting his dedicational service
[1:22:27] amen Solomon seeing that
[1:22:30] amen and and I wonder I wonder what
[1:22:34] Solomon really has seen when he starts
[1:22:36] speaking now then said Solomon
[1:22:40] the Lord has said that he would dwell in
[1:22:45] the thick Darkness
[1:22:47] amen what a profound what an amazing
[1:22:51] statement
[1:22:52] amen seeing that now Solomon's saying
[1:22:55] the Lord is dwelling in thick Darkness
[1:23:01] he's seeing the worship
[1:23:03] amen he's seeing worship
[1:23:06] and then he's saying he's inspired to
[1:23:09] say oh the Lord is dwelling in thick
[1:23:12] Darkness
[1:23:13] that means the Lord is working in a
[1:23:17] mysterious way
[1:23:19] Hallelujah he's doing that amen he's
[1:23:23] working in a mysterious way so we it
[1:23:25] will it will guide us a little bit on
[1:23:27] our way then go to Revelations 13 verse
[1:23:29] 8.
[1:23:31] Revelations 13 verse 8 we want to read
[1:23:36] very well a well-known scripture
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:43] Revelation 13 verse 8 and all that dwell
[1:23:47] upon the Earth shall worship Him
[1:23:52] whose names are not written in the book
[1:23:55] of the life of the lamb slain from the
[1:23:58] foundation of the world
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:03] what a what a statement
[1:24:07] Hallelujah let us pray dear heavenly
[1:24:09] father we are coming so rejoicing and
[1:24:14] and thankful again before your throne of
[1:24:17] grace and mercy
[1:24:19] father and we ask father may you guide
[1:24:22] and lead us this evening into into a
[1:24:24] true worship father we pray father that
[1:24:27] we can understand what you desire from
[1:24:29] us what your heart's desire is why you
[1:24:33] made us why you created us why we are
[1:24:37] here on Earth
[1:24:38] we understand we are not here on Earth
[1:24:40] for ourselves what we are here on Earth
[1:24:42] for a Divine Divine Purpose father and
[1:24:45] we ask to help us to step into our
[1:24:48] Divine Purpose we ask you father and may
[1:24:51] it be all for the honor and Glory of
[1:24:53] your name and father and just bless the
[1:24:56] church bless the pastor bless brother
[1:24:58] Ron in a mighty way father and and just
[1:25:01] help us and just let help us just to
[1:25:05] continue that work that you have placed
[1:25:08] upon our hearts father we ask it all for
[1:25:11] your honor and For Your Glory in Jesus
[1:25:13] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[1:25:15] you may be seated
[1:25:17] in the presence of the Lord amen
[1:25:20] so a dedicated to worship as we have as
[1:25:23] we have seen and and I want to start
[1:25:25] maybe with her with because it's it will
[1:25:28] be about worship it will be about this
[1:25:31] is really something that that dwara was
[1:25:33] pondering also about you know his
[1:25:35] anniversary coming here and and uh and
[1:25:39] and so it's it's all together it is all
[1:25:42] together about worship and to be
[1:25:45] dedicated to worship and uh as brother
[1:25:49] Brennan was using that um in in the
[1:25:52] message dedication he made that
[1:25:54] statement from there actually I I got
[1:25:56] really inspired and brother Adam is
[1:25:59] praying here he said now my sincere
[1:26:01] prayer is that every worshiper
[1:26:05] will dedicate his own Temple to worship
[1:26:10] in a temple that has been dedicated for
[1:26:14] worship
[1:26:15] that's the real dedication
[1:26:18] so he the prophet said he said so that
[1:26:21] we will dedicate his own Temple to
[1:26:24] worship
[1:26:26] in the temple that's been dedicated for
[1:26:29] worship
[1:26:31] so this judge building is dedicated for
[1:26:35] worship
[1:26:36] but you are Dedicated To Worship
[1:26:41] amen and this is how the prophet really
[1:26:43] made it made it made it I think so clear
[1:26:45] that we are here to worship
[1:26:49] then brother Adam said in the in the
[1:26:51] message a statue of a perfect man
[1:26:54] he said listen it is God condescending
[1:26:57] to his creation
[1:27:00] God wants to be worshiped
[1:27:03] the word god means object of worship
[1:27:07] and is God now trying to condition his
[1:27:11] people
[1:27:12] so that that he can get from them what
[1:27:16] he created them for
[1:27:19] Hallelujah so now God wants to get from
[1:27:23] us
[1:27:24] what he created us for
[1:27:26] and who's willing this evening
[1:27:29] to just join in
[1:27:31] amen join in that worship
[1:27:34] and that worship is more than just to
[1:27:36] say words more than just to say Amen
[1:27:39] that goes together that you know it's
[1:27:41] more than to sing but that worship
[1:27:42] finally is expression
[1:27:47] amen who's ready
[1:27:49] that can say Lord I Want To Worship
[1:27:52] and if we worship then we allow him to
[1:27:55] express himself
[1:27:58] in the way that he wants to express
[1:28:00] himself
[1:28:01] this is what God is looking for
[1:28:03] this is his desire he wants worshiper
[1:28:07] remember how we we saw yesterday the
[1:28:09] woman at the well he was telling her the
[1:28:12] father
[1:28:13] he's seeking worshiper
[1:28:16] worshiper that worship Him in spirit and
[1:28:20] in truth
[1:28:21] amen so it is the father keep that in
[1:28:23] mind it is the father that is looking
[1:28:25] for worshiper it is not the son
[1:28:28] but it is the father
[1:28:31] amen it is the father and we will see
[1:28:33] that from the beginning then brother
[1:28:34] random continued a little bit he said
[1:28:36] he said now he said
[1:28:39] God in the Bible he said he said Stephen
[1:28:42] as he said in the Bible the most high
[1:28:44] don't dwell in temples made with hands
[1:28:47] for Heaven is my throne and the Earth is
[1:28:50] my footstool and where is the place of
[1:28:53] my rest but the body has thou prepared
[1:28:55] me
[1:28:57] amen there you are listen and a body has
[1:29:00] now prepared me God dwells in this
[1:29:03] nature of men
[1:29:05] reflecting himself into that being
[1:29:09] that's perfect worship
[1:29:12] if he can reflect his being
[1:29:16] in you that's perfect worship
[1:29:19] God in us being his Tabernacle God
[1:29:23] manifesting oh brother and said
[1:29:25] wonderful thing
[1:29:27] amen so God dwells in the Statue of a
[1:29:29] man reflecting himself into that being
[1:29:33] perfect worship
[1:29:37] Hallelujah
[1:29:39] and I really because as we have read
[1:29:42] Revelation 13 verse 8.
[1:29:45] and as we see today the the world in the
[1:29:49] condition as it is in
[1:29:51] and Revelation 13 verse 8 tells us
[1:29:55] that finally
[1:29:56] all will worship
[1:30:03] amen
[1:30:05] so all will worship
[1:30:09] all will worship the enemy
[1:30:15] when will that happen
[1:30:19] is it not happening now
[1:30:22] look around go out
[1:30:24] look around what do you see
[1:30:29] so worship
[1:30:30] is more than we think it is
[1:30:34] because you understand that All Shall
[1:30:37] worship Him
[1:30:40] and do you believe today we're living in
[1:30:41] a world but the whole world is
[1:30:43] worshiping
[1:30:46] is that right you see governments are
[1:30:48] worshiping
[1:30:50] churches are worshiping
[1:30:54] amen and they are not worshiping Jesus
[1:30:57] Christ
[1:30:59] the prophet said they are worshiping the
[1:31:02] devil
[1:31:04] to make it plain
[1:31:06] but go to the churches what do you hear
[1:31:09] what do you think they sing nice songs
[1:31:12] they sing songs about Jesus Christ
[1:31:16] and yet they are worshiping Satan
[1:31:21] so I think it's really it's really good
[1:31:24] to look at this subject a Little Closer
[1:31:26] because we want to worship the right
[1:31:28] thing right
[1:31:29] amen We Want To Worship in spirit and in
[1:31:32] truth
[1:31:34] not just only in spirit but also in
[1:31:36] truth what is the truth the Vindicated
[1:31:39] word for this hour
[1:31:43] Hallelujah and if we understand that
[1:31:46] worship is more than than just making a
[1:31:49] sound
[1:31:51] amen we will see that because if the
[1:31:53] whole world is worshiping tell you go
[1:31:55] around who is worshiping Satan
[1:32:00] do you see nobody on the street praying
[1:32:03] to Satan
[1:32:05] you see nobody on the street or wherever
[1:32:07] you are just making nice words or just
[1:32:10] singing to Satan no but the Bible said
[1:32:12] All Shall worship Him
[1:32:17] and it is happening around you
[1:32:20] amen it is happening around us so the
[1:32:22] whole world is worshiping
[1:32:30] can we say Amen to that
[1:32:33] so you see worship is much more than we
[1:32:35] think
[1:32:39] I think also it maybe it's it's good to
[1:32:41] have a little bit closer look how the
[1:32:43] prophet really uh brought things and
[1:32:47] brother Branham said in the message
[1:32:48] Satan Eden
[1:32:51] the God of this world today the
[1:32:53] worshiped person of this world today is
[1:32:57] Satan
[1:32:58] and the people are ignorant of
[1:33:01] worshiping Satan but it is Satan
[1:33:03] impersonating himself as a church
[1:33:06] as a church they worship Satan
[1:33:10] thinking that they are worshiping God
[1:33:12] through the church but it's a way Satan
[1:33:16] has done it
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:22] God of this evil age brother random said
[1:33:25] he wasn't spoke of God in the edge of
[1:33:27] Noah he said listen Satan doesn't spoke
[1:33:31] of God of any other age but this age
[1:33:34] he wasn't spoke of the god of the age of
[1:33:36] Noah he wasn't spoke of of the god of
[1:33:38] the age of Moses a god of the age of
[1:33:40] Elijah but in this evil age oh don't
[1:33:42] miss it he is the God of this evil age
[1:33:45] worshiped by millions and billions of
[1:33:49] people
[1:33:50] and they don't know it
[1:33:52] but let the scripture uncover him this
[1:33:54] morning and exceed and you will know
[1:33:56] let's see the scripture so let us see
[1:33:58] let us the scripture uncover him
[1:34:01] so that we understand that we understand
[1:34:03] that our worship is towards God and God
[1:34:08] is Desiring a worship from us we've seen
[1:34:11] so many and that worship what we see in
[1:34:13] the world is today you see the there's
[1:34:16] so many uh things or can I call it
[1:34:20] attributes or things of Satan being
[1:34:22] manifested you see all around us what
[1:34:26] evil is being manifested becoming flesh
[1:34:30] is that right
[1:34:32] amen people call it Liberty but actually
[1:34:35] they are bound
[1:34:36] they're total bounds
[1:34:39] they're tools in the hand of the enemy
[1:34:42] so the enemy can express himself through
[1:34:45] them and they're just expressing that
[1:34:48] all the dirt that is in the enemy
[1:34:52] Hallelujah that is the worship finally
[1:34:56] that is the worship that we are talking
[1:34:57] of and we are Dedicated To Worship
[1:35:01] Amen to allow God that he can express
[1:35:04] himself
[1:35:06] in us in our lives so he can live
[1:35:09] himself out that is true worship
[1:35:12] Hallelujah and this is what the father
[1:35:15] this is the desire of the father this is
[1:35:17] really what the father has for a desire
[1:35:20] is to be worshiped
[1:35:24] see and and we see as we have said it or
[1:35:28] read it also yesterday
[1:35:30] uh it was it was it was it was actually
[1:35:34] God why we started in the the Garden of
[1:35:37] Eden and we saw what God was doing in
[1:35:40] Eden it was the father
[1:35:42] it was God himself we jump now in Eden
[1:35:45] just for a short while and then maybe we
[1:35:47] go back to before the foundation of the
[1:35:49] world
[1:35:50] because there we see actually how it
[1:35:52] really started but here in Eden
[1:35:54] as God has made had made a place
[1:35:58] for worship
[1:36:00] which is called the Garden of Eden
[1:36:02] that was the place for worship
[1:36:05] and then he put things into Eden
[1:36:09] that became places to worship
[1:36:14] amen so Eden was for worship
[1:36:19] and Adam and Eve was to worship
[1:36:23] that's why God created them remember oh
[1:36:26] God help us remember how the Bible said
[1:36:29] that all things are created
[1:36:34] his own pleasure
[1:36:36] and when we have read in second
[1:36:38] chronicles that Solomon said that God
[1:36:40] dwells in darkness he understood he
[1:36:43] looked down the road I believe he could
[1:36:45] see it how in in what kind of a special
[1:36:48] way God would generate worship
[1:36:52] amen
[1:36:54] you believe that all things are created
[1:36:57] for his pleasure
[1:37:00] who created
[1:37:02] the devil
[1:37:05] who created evil
[1:37:11] all I tell you is this what Solomon have
[1:37:14] seen as he was dedicated and seeing the
[1:37:16] worship he could see my goodness the way
[1:37:19] what God was doing this is really
[1:37:21] mysterious
[1:37:23] so all things are created for his own
[1:37:26] pleasure
[1:37:28] he creates them
[1:37:30] God needs evil
[1:37:38] God needs the evil
[1:37:40] to show that he is a good god
[1:37:46] without the evil things we would not
[1:37:50] really appreciate
[1:37:52] a good God
[1:37:58] do you think God created the devil not
[1:38:00] knowing what would go on
[1:38:02] surely he knew what would go on
[1:38:05] amen he's God he knows everything
[1:38:08] he knows the end from the beginning and
[1:38:10] even he created Satan as his right hand
[1:38:12] man
[1:38:13] knowing what he would do
[1:38:16] amen knowing what he would do
[1:38:19] so that he created them allow me to say
[1:38:21] that because he needed him
[1:38:26] Hallelujah church this bad thing
[1:38:29] happening around us bad thing evil
[1:38:32] things happening with you
[1:38:34] but but hope we get it we need that
[1:38:39] God allows that so can that he can
[1:38:42] manifest through you
[1:38:45] what is all in him
[1:38:49] Hallelujah we are not at the end of the
[1:38:51] end of that God is just manifesting
[1:38:54] we're coming to the final church because
[1:38:56] the as the prophet would say all that
[1:38:58] God was is now in the in Christ and all
[1:39:01] that Christ was is now in the church
[1:39:04] all that God was was his attributes
[1:39:07] this is what God is
[1:39:10] God is his attributes
[1:39:13] and you were one of them
[1:39:17] is it right
[1:39:19] so on those attributes that God was is
[1:39:22] now in the church waiting just for the
[1:39:26] right time and circumstances to be
[1:39:28] expressed
[1:39:31] I tell you when I heard the song that
[1:39:34] then sings my soul my savior got to thee
[1:39:37] How Great Thou Art
[1:39:39] I said praise the lord we serve a mighty
[1:39:42] God
[1:39:43] Hallelujah we serve a living God
[1:39:46] amen there's a God that you cannot put
[1:39:49] into a box
[1:39:50] he can do whatever he wants
[1:39:53] he don't have to hurt my permission you
[1:39:55] don't have to ask your permission he
[1:39:57] does what he wants because he is God
[1:40:03] don't put him in a box
[1:40:05] don't box him down he's God and he wants
[1:40:08] to unveil himself
[1:40:13] so when Solomon saw that he said he what
[1:40:16] what must he have seen I don't know but
[1:40:19] I will for my I can imagine what he saw
[1:40:21] when he when he saw the dedication when
[1:40:23] he saw we know now what happened with
[1:40:26] the temple after a while that wonderful
[1:40:28] Temple
[1:40:29] that beautiful Temple that Solomon built
[1:40:32] it that wonderful Temple that the Lord
[1:40:34] filled with his Spirit after a couple of
[1:40:36] years was destroyed
[1:40:42] amen
[1:40:44] why was God allowing that
[1:40:46] he was generating worship
[1:40:53] Hallelujah
[1:40:54] the whole church there's things around
[1:40:57] us
[1:40:58] that we feel that should not happen to
[1:41:00] us
[1:41:05] we feel those things may this is it's
[1:41:08] not good it's evil yes
[1:41:10] but God allows them
[1:41:13] because he knows what's inside of you
[1:41:16] he knows what he created you for
[1:41:20] and he wants to see that through you
[1:41:22] manifest it
[1:41:33] but behind that all stands the father
[1:41:36] it is it is God allow me quickly to jump
[1:41:40] how the prophets and I'm so glad we had
[1:41:43] a prophet is that
[1:41:44] I tell you if we wouldn't had him we
[1:41:46] would be deceived
[1:41:48] totally like the first church was
[1:41:50] deceived quickly
[1:41:52] because the things come so different
[1:41:54] than we think and expect and wouldn't we
[1:41:56] have the prophet for it
[1:41:58] amen
[1:41:59] wouldn't we have the prophet for it we
[1:42:01] would be deceived
[1:42:03] we we will look at things is that that's
[1:42:05] evil that's not good
[1:42:07] yes
[1:42:09] and maybe even we would pray against it
[1:42:13] but it is God just God allowing it to
[1:42:16] prove who he is
[1:42:18] we have our category good and bad
[1:42:21] there will be good people in hell
[1:42:25] and bad people in heaven
[1:42:32] why do I say that because we have our we
[1:42:34] have our you understand that that that
[1:42:36] good young man the Rich Young Ruler
[1:42:39] he was a good guy he was a good boy
[1:42:42] from its youth
[1:42:44] but he opened his eyes in hell
[1:42:48] when he left the scene the prophet would
[1:42:50] say every flag was on you know was it
[1:42:53] was just it was just a wonderful man he
[1:42:55] was a good guy
[1:42:57] and everything that people would say
[1:42:59] about him at his funeral you know how
[1:43:00] surely he made his way to heaven I mean
[1:43:02] he was such a good boy he he just we
[1:43:05] understand that he opened his eyes in
[1:43:07] hell
[1:43:10] and we all understand
[1:43:13] remember how it was with
[1:43:15] David and Saul
[1:43:20] we don't understand that church
[1:43:22] sometimes hard to understand
[1:43:25] but you know where Saul was
[1:43:27] the prophet told him tomorrow you will
[1:43:29] be with me
[1:43:32] and he became an enemy to God
[1:43:38] so may God help us
[1:43:41] that we get out of every box
[1:43:45] that we leave every camp
[1:43:47] the prophet called us out of every camp
[1:43:51] come out of her my people
[1:43:54] come out of every camp
[1:43:57] every denominational thinking
[1:44:00] come out
[1:44:01] because you are called out to manifest
[1:44:04] God in its entirety
[1:44:08] that's why we are here for church we are
[1:44:10] not here to play church we are not here
[1:44:12] just to to warm the seeds we are not
[1:44:14] just here to pay tithes and offering
[1:44:15] that's wonderful we should do that
[1:44:17] but we are here for a Divine Purpose
[1:44:20] to reveal all that God is
[1:44:26] excuse me when I get excited because I
[1:44:28] see the father I see the Lord I see the
[1:44:31] Lord moving amongst us
[1:44:34] and you understand it is such a mystery
[1:44:37] it is it is such a thick darkness that
[1:44:40] the devil don't know it
[1:44:45] honestly if the devil would understood
[1:44:48] what he would do to Jesus
[1:44:52] he would have pluck him from the cross
[1:44:57] is it under it says sorry look how many
[1:45:00] bad things happen to Jesus
[1:45:03] how he cried at the cross how he cried
[1:45:06] my God my God why herself forsaken me
[1:45:09] and he was not playing
[1:45:13] he was not playing a game
[1:45:16] this is what he cried out this is what
[1:45:18] he felt
[1:45:20] and the devil thought the devil thought
[1:45:22] I got him
[1:45:23] but little later he understood that make
[1:45:25] a biggest mistake of my life
[1:45:29] and one day Satan will understand all
[1:45:31] the evil things he put upon you he made
[1:45:34] the biggest mistake in his life
[1:45:39] because of those situations you were
[1:45:42] able to manifest all that God is thank
[1:45:45] you
[1:45:49] amen can a mother can God you know at
[1:45:52] one time Israel was asking themselves
[1:45:54] the question you can fight it in
[1:45:56] Jeremiah
[1:45:57] you can find a Jeremiah and also the
[1:46:00] Israel were asking does God love us
[1:46:03] is God still with us
[1:46:05] and God would tell his people
[1:46:08] can a mother forget her suckling child
[1:46:13] and we understand no mother can forget
[1:46:15] his subling child unless she is
[1:46:17] completely out of her mind
[1:46:20] but God cannot be out of his mind
[1:46:22] because he is the mind
[1:46:26] so can can a mother and then the Bible
[1:46:28] said maybe a mother can forget
[1:46:31] but God said but I can never forget you
[1:46:35] you know why God cannot forget you
[1:46:37] because you are his thoughts
[1:46:42] that's why he cannot forget you because
[1:46:44] you belong to him
[1:46:49] and God just wanted to teach Israel tell
[1:46:51] Israel I can never forget you
[1:46:54] I have a plan yeah
[1:46:55] I just have a plan with you you are my
[1:46:58] chosen people not because you are the
[1:47:00] nicest you are stubborn people God said
[1:47:04] is that right not because they were the
[1:47:06] nicest people and they were there the
[1:47:08] handsome people and really now he said
[1:47:09] God said you are stubborn people
[1:47:12] but yet I have chosen you
[1:47:16] I have chosen you
[1:47:18] so has God chosen the elect the bride
[1:47:22] like he chose Israel so he chose the
[1:47:24] bride for what for expression
[1:47:27] because God said I found in you Israel
[1:47:31] equality no one else can express myself
[1:47:34] like you
[1:47:42] Hallelujah
[1:47:43] amen so let's let us be dedicated to
[1:47:47] that worship
[1:47:48] that's all about dedication like we saw
[1:47:50] yesterday you know understand why why it
[1:47:53] is why it is good to have inventory once
[1:47:56] in a while just to see what is occupying
[1:47:58] you how Satan in the beginning like we
[1:48:00] said yesterday and I think it becomes
[1:48:03] very clear
[1:48:04] who is standing behind it it was not
[1:48:06] Adam
[1:48:07] standing behind is trying to manifest
[1:48:10] himself
[1:48:12] it was the father
[1:48:15] he said to Adam you know Adam
[1:48:18] you have nothing to do with that
[1:48:20] do you know that the inheritance that we
[1:48:23] have
[1:48:24] it's not an inheritance that Jesus
[1:48:26] Christ
[1:48:27] Is inheriting Us
[1:48:32] brother Adam said Jesus never left you
[1:48:34] an inheritance
[1:48:36] he died
[1:48:38] for your inheritance
[1:48:41] he said but it is God
[1:48:43] leaving you an inheritance that's why
[1:48:47] Paul could say we are Heirs of God
[1:48:51] through Jesus Christ
[1:48:57] Hallelujah
[1:49:01] now he is again the father just just I
[1:49:04] just he couldn't get away from that it
[1:49:06] is the father
[1:49:07] I could see how brother Branham could
[1:49:09] say in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:49:10] revealed how you said you know he said
[1:49:13] why do you hang a church why do you
[1:49:16] thirst it is the father trying to reveal
[1:49:20] these things to you
[1:49:23] it is the father
[1:49:25] Church behind it
[1:49:27] it's the father
[1:49:30] behind that is God almighty
[1:49:37] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:49:42] Jesus never came to reveal the son
[1:49:46] he came to reveal whom the father
[1:49:52] Hallelujah he came to reveal the father
[1:49:55] and he got so misunderstood
[1:49:58] by the people
[1:50:00] while he was unveiling the father why he
[1:50:03] was showing how great God Is So when all
[1:50:07] the religious world had him boxed and
[1:50:09] fixed
[1:50:10] here came Jesus
[1:50:13] and they cast a woman before him
[1:50:16] you understand that caught in adultery
[1:50:19] and they all knew what the box is saying
[1:50:22] they all knew what the law was telling
[1:50:25] them
[1:50:28] then they asked Jesus what do you say
[1:50:30] about this
[1:50:36] you know what he's at
[1:50:38] whom of you
[1:50:40] is without sin
[1:50:42] you throw the first stone
[1:50:50] he was expressing
[1:50:52] another side of God
[1:50:55] this was not just Jesus feeling sorry
[1:50:57] for that woman
[1:51:00] this was not human sympathy
[1:51:07] amen that was almighty God revealed
[1:51:13] because Jesus could do nothing
[1:51:16] unless the father
[1:51:18] shows him
[1:51:21] so he was
[1:51:23] The Father revealed all the fullness
[1:51:26] dwelleth in him
[1:51:28] is that right
[1:51:30] and he was just there not his own
[1:51:33] but he was just there manifesting what
[1:51:36] the father wanted he said this is my
[1:51:38] meat to do the will of God
[1:51:42] is that also our meet this evening
[1:51:44] to do the will of God
[1:51:46] to allow God to be God
[1:51:48] Hallelujah let us allow God to be God
[1:51:51] Church
[1:51:52] even in 2023 that God is still God and
[1:51:55] he can do whatever he wants
[1:52:01] it is the father behind it
[1:52:04] it is God behind the church
[1:52:06] he made it so clear
