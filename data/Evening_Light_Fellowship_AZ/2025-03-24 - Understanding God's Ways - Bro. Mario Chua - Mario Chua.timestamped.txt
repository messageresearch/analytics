[37:52] this
[37:52] morning amen
[37:55] so it's really an honor and privilege to
[37:58] serve each and every one of
[38:00] you amen
[38:06] and we'll go directly to the word of God
[38:08] I have this
[38:11] uh just a very simple thought this
[38:16] morning and I trust that the Lord will
[38:19] bless us this morning so thank you
[38:21] mician thank you brother Robert for
[38:24] setting at at me this morning just
[38:27] simple thought that uh my wife always
[38:30] asking me who is the preacher this
[38:34] morning and I always told her that it's
[38:37] the holy ghost that will be preaching
[38:40] amen because if I will be preaching
[38:43] people will run and
[38:45] go so praise the lord it's an honor to
[38:48] be in his presence so I want uh invite
[38:52] each and everyone to turn with me in the
[38:54] Book of Romans chter 8: 28 the very very
[38:58] simple and very familiar
[39:01] scripture we always uh quote this
[39:04] scripture but we always know that the
[39:07] word of God was written by inspiration
[39:11] that's
[39:13] right and it is the Breath of God that
[39:16] inspired the writer to write this so
[39:19] it's always
[39:21] alive there is always something in it
[39:24] even though how simple it is there is
[39:26] always something inside it am
[39:31] amen I think this is Brother Daniel La
[39:36] son God bless you
[39:39] brother amen Romans 8:28 and we know
[39:43] that all
[39:44] things work together for good to them
[39:48] that love
[39:49] God to them who are called according to
[39:53] his purpose amen and may the Lord have
[39:56] the blessings upon the withing this word
[39:57] you may now be
[40:01] eting
[40:03] amen so I will uh title this a little
[40:06] thought the
[40:09] understanding of God's way and we know
[40:12] that according to Isaiah 58 that uh his
[40:16] ways are higher than our
[40:18] ways and his thoughts are higher than
[40:21] our
[40:22] thoughts so even just a little
[40:25] understanding of his way will
[40:28] sees our pain and our troubles and maybe
[40:32] disappointment Our
[40:34] Lives because this scripture that we
[40:37] know that all things works together for
[40:39] good to them that love the Lord amen
[40:42] thank you Lord yes it will
[40:47] be meaningful if we have a personal
[40:52] relationship with
[40:53] God we can appreciate this scripture if
[40:56] we have this personal walk with
[41:01] God
[41:03] because as the prophet said that I will
[41:06] just take my time and just to relax
[41:11] amen cuz the prophet said God don't have
[41:14] any grandchildren that's right only Sons
[41:17] and Daughters of Goden so everybody
[41:20] needs to be born again yes amen so we
[41:23] need to
[41:24] experience a personal relationship ship
[41:28] with God in order to appreciate the
[41:31] scripture that all
[41:34] things not only the good
[41:37] things because we are always enjoying
[41:40] the good things the blessings that comes
[41:43] our way we always appreciate God we
[41:45] praise him for the good things that come
[41:47] our ways amen so the good things and all
[41:51] things is also included the bad things
[41:54] that's right our disappointment
[41:57] our embarrassment our discouragement our
[42:01] failures and the scripture said that all
[42:04] things bad or good works together amen
[42:09] and the emphasis is if you love
[42:14] God so you need to be in love with
[42:17] God and you can appreciate how that the
[42:21] all things works together for good to
[42:23] them that love the
[42:25] Lord and to them who are called oh
[42:29] Hallelujah so if you're not called of
[42:31] God in these last
[42:33] days the things that comes your way you
[42:36] will always question God you will be
[42:40] discouraged you will run away from God
[42:45] but if you love God Amen you appreciate
[42:48] and understand that everything that
[42:51] comes our ways good or
[42:53] bad amen is for our own good
[42:59] especially the next verse when he said
[43:01] for whom he did for no he also did
[43:05] predestinate to be conformed to the
[43:08] image of God everything that comes away
[43:11] bad or good it is for the purpose to
[43:14] conform us into the image of his son
[43:18] praise the Lord that he might be the
[43:20] first born among many
[43:21] Brethren and moreover whom he did
[43:25] predestinate them he also called yes and
[43:29] whom and and whom he called them he
[43:33] also praise God Justified or
[43:37] glorified amen
[43:40] so so this is more about trials but when
[43:45] it comes to our position in Christ we
[43:47] are already
[43:48] sealed yes sir so when we wake up about
[43:52] what we preached uh the last time about
[43:55] the events of the doors and we know that
[43:58] we have already at it was in the days of
[44:00] solom so shall it be at the coming of
[44:02] the son of manen and we are witnessing
[44:05] in these last days that the son of man
[44:07] is revealing himself again and it was in
[44:10] the days of Noah solom so shall it be at
[44:14] the coming of the son of man and we know
[44:17] that Noah was sumon to come up or come
[44:20] into the ark which is power in our age
[44:23] Revelation 4:1 that says come up hereen
[44:26] and will show you things to come amen so
[44:31] when Noah entered into the ark it was
[44:34] God who shut the
[44:37] door no one shut it but it was God Amen
[44:41] but the prophet said but I want you to
[44:43] pay attention even though the door was
[44:46] shut even though our posession position
[44:48] is already secured we are Sons and
[44:50] Daughters of God and the prophet said
[44:52] you need to watch because the testing
[44:55] time is still in inside the ark that's
[44:58] right although our position already
[45:01] secured we realize that we are Sons and
[45:03] Daughters of God predestinated before
[45:06] the foundation of the word we walk
[45:07] according to the Revelation that was
[45:10] given to us but the testing is still
[45:13] inside the
[45:15] ark as we said a while ago that the
[45:18] testing is not to prove Noah
[45:21] Faith but to test his faith in other
[45:25] words to reveal his faith in other words
[45:28] to express or to express his
[45:32] faith because remember we inside the ark
[45:35] God said that I will destroy the Earth
[45:39] and when he shut the door God shut the
[45:42] door Noah is expecting that God is going
[45:45] to fulfill his word amen
[45:48] amen but the first day it didn't
[45:54] rain come on second day and then train
[45:58] that's right there must be a commotion
[46:00] inside the ark all those animal the pool
[46:04] or something like that the
[46:07] noise did Noah can bear the the the
[46:10] pressure
[46:12] inside outside of the animals the lion
[46:16] when he
[46:18] Roar maybe the elephant when he cry all
[46:22] those animals remember the pressure and
[46:26] Noah is
[46:27] waiting for the Fulfillment of God's
[46:30] promise to judge the word but it didn't
[46:36] happen but he continue on as we the quot
[46:40] last time that Noah continue on as the
[46:42] prophet said our testing is still going
[46:44] on
[46:46] Amen but remember we are already heard
[46:50] The Voice Hallelujah we are now in the
[46:53] process of the changing of our body and
[46:55] Noah is in the process going going into
[46:57] another
[46:59] world because he heard the shout and we
[47:01] know that the shout the voice and the
[47:04] Trump is now in
[47:07] progress
[47:08] amen so it was not a trial to prove his
[47:11] faith because he already proved his
[47:13] faith because for 120 years he
[47:16] waited and he entered that is
[47:21] proving his faith but then inside he
[47:25] wait for seven days
[47:27] that is to display his faith he never
[47:30] wobble amen and remember how can he
[47:33] wobble how can he be discouraged that it
[47:36] was God who shut the
[47:38] door glory in other words we are sealed
[47:42] until the day of our Redemption so
[47:44] whatever happens in our life the testing
[47:46] time is not to prove our faith but to
[47:48] display our faith in these last days as
[47:51] the prophet said that we
[47:54] are being called from this Satan Eden
[47:58] that's right to prove to Satan that
[47:59] there will be a bride that will not bow
[48:01] down to his deception in this last day
[48:04] there will be a bride that will stand
[48:06] and will display the word made flesh in
[48:09] these last days amen it was not to prove
[48:12] but to display his fa just like Abraham
[48:14] in chapter
[48:16] 22 when God told him Abraham I want you
[48:21] to sacrifice your son so it was not to
[48:24] prove his faith because he already
[48:26] proved his faith for 25 years he waited
[48:28] for the promise to come to
[48:30] pass he waited 25 years and God
[48:33] fulfilled it but now after a few years
[48:37] later God appeared again and said I want
[48:40] you to sacrifice your
[48:47] son and I want you to sacrifice your son
[48:50] in the mountain that I'm
[48:53] going to show you and if you read your
[48:58] scripture early in the morning he rise
[49:01] up and
[49:02] go ye don't waste any time right amen
[49:07] amen so when God called you or touch you
[49:09] this morning don't waste any time
[49:12] response to the word of God don't wait
[49:14] for tomorrow because maybe tomorrow
[49:15] it'll be too late right he responds
[49:19] immediately and go and bring to Young L
[49:22] with him to young people yes
[49:25] amen maybe Abraham is so
[49:30] unconscious but he knows within his
[49:33] heart amen so he
[49:35] brought his son and his two young
[49:39] people and God gave him three
[49:43] days three days to think it
[49:46] over you know
[49:49] Isaac was his testimony amen that he
[49:53] become a father of many nation and he he
[49:56] already proved the
[49:59] faith he loved Isaac so much and even
[50:05] God told him sacrifice your only
[50:08] son remember that he has two
[50:14] son amen amen but the son of the promise
[50:18] is only Isaac so God is so specific
[50:21] sacrifice your
[50:24] son God gave him three days to think it
[50:29] over that's why God is so gracious he
[50:33] don't easily judge God is longsuffering
[50:36] he gave him three days to think it over
[50:39] to change his mind but after three days
[50:42] instead of changing his mind he said
[50:45] okay you two young people wait here I
[50:49] and my lad will go upstairs and worship
[50:52] God and we'll come back to you
[50:54] hallelujah amen
[50:57] so instead instead of changing his mind
[51:01] he was
[51:03] determined because he knows that he
[51:05] received Isaac from the dead so if God
[51:08] if ever that God or Isa or Abraham will
[51:13] bring sacrifice God will raise up but he
[51:16] tried it he goes out there yes and he
[51:19] bring the altar
[51:23] sacrifice and Isaac said father there is
[51:27] the altar the sacrif where is the
[51:30] sacrifice and Abraham said the Lord
[51:33] himself will offer a sacrifice that's
[51:37] right and when he is
[51:40] about to offer a
[51:42] sacrifice an angel of the Lord
[51:45] appear Abraham I know you displayed your
[51:51] faith amen amen there is already a
[51:54] ram as the prophet said that Ram was not
[51:58] birth it was the spoken word that's
[52:01] right and who spoke the ram into
[52:03] existence Abraham did amen amen so
[52:07] that's why the spoken word now is to dis
[52:10] be displayed in this last days because
[52:12] Faith Hallelujah is already in each and
[52:16] every one of us God is going to display
[52:19] what he put in our heart he need to
[52:21] display it physically so when Abraham
[52:25] said the Lord himself
[52:29] shall offer a sacrifice who is the
[52:31] mouthpie of the Lord Abraham did because
[52:35] he said the Lord himself shall offer
[52:38] sacrifice and the ram
[52:41] appear amen
[52:43] amen so that's why in these last days we
[52:46] need
[52:47] to see God's
[52:51] ways while we are in a stage of our
[52:53] testing time this is not to prove our
[52:57] faith but to display the faith that God
[52:59] put in our heart amen amen so we will we
[53:02] know that we have a lot of example when
[53:06] it comes to the Old Testament Saints
[53:08] because all of the Testament Saints are
[53:11] their are shadows to the new things so
[53:14] maybe each and every one of us is a
[53:16] favorite uh character in The
[53:20] Bible but one thing that stand
[53:23] out in my heart while I read this
[53:26] scripture is the life story of
[53:34] Joseph as the prophet said that
[53:40] uh even brother brandham maybe one of
[53:43] his favorite character was Joseph
[53:45] because he named his son up that
[53:47] Joseph because the life story of Joseph
[53:50] if we can preach it it will take maybe
[53:53] months and months and
[53:54] months but I don't have the gift to
[53:58] preach about
[54:00] shers mine is just come and go God will
[54:05] pick something and put it or deliver it
[54:09] and that's it amen then the next day I
[54:11] will just wait for a call and get it and
[54:14] deliver it amen thank you Lord that's
[54:17] why I don't become a pastor because I
[54:19] don't have any
[54:24] patience that's why we appreciate that
[54:27] we have a pastor amen who was patience
[54:30] and
[54:32] caring always
[54:34] uh looking at the every
[54:38] details I always appreciate better one
[54:40] because he seems to know everybody in
[54:43] the church by
[54:45] name me I always forgot the
[54:48] name that's why I just forgive me I say
[54:51] hello brother hello sister I cannot
[54:53] mention name because I always forget
[54:55] names amen
[54:57] maybe that's the the the the greatest uh
[54:59] weaknesses that I have forgetting
[55:02] names I always hello brother what is
[55:04] your name and he said George few seconds
[55:07] what is your name so just forgive me for
[55:10] that but thank God that we have an
[55:12] address brothers and sisters I think
[55:15] that will be enough don't be offended
[55:18] when we call just you brothers and you
[55:20] forget the name but I think the sweetest
[55:23] thing that people can remember is their
[55:25] names
[55:27] so
[55:28] just when you approach me just introduce
[55:31] your name right
[55:32] away so that I can not forget amen so
[55:37] Joseph as the prophet said Joseph we can
[55:41] find perfection in
[55:44] Joseph so Abraham is by election and we
[55:49] know that Abraham was elected by God
[55:51] chosen by God praise God it is God's
[55:53] Sovereign will that he elected Abraham
[55:57] Abraham is nothing we know all the
[55:59] stories about Abraham and we can rely
[56:02] upon or can relate to our calling with
[56:05] God we are nothing we are we are not
[56:08] somebody but by God grace he called us
[56:11] out of millions of people on this Earth
[56:14] he called us many reject the message of
[56:17] the hour but we receive the message
[56:19] without any hesitation without any
[56:22] question we just believe it and we
[56:24] ourselves don't know why we believe
[56:26] believe
[56:27] it and that is by election amen and
[56:31] Isaac is justification because Isaac was
[56:33] the manifestations of the promise of God
[56:36] I we can say that Jacob is just Grace
[56:39] you know it's all Grace because Jacob as
[56:42] a
[56:43] deceiver a
[56:45] Cher but he found Grace in the eye of
[56:48] God thank you Lord so as the prophet
[56:51] said but in Joseph we can find
[56:54] perfection
[56:56] so the life story of Joseph we can see
[57:02] it all around from Genesis to the
[57:04] Revelation because Joseph is always a
[57:07] type of
[57:08] Christ
[57:11] and the life story of Joseph in Genesis
[57:15] is also patterned in The Seven jsh Feast
[57:18] of Leviticus chapter
[57:20] 23 so
[57:23] the uh Feast of Leviticus is the past
[57:26] over the unleaving bread the first fruit
[57:30] the Pentecost the trumpets the atonement
[57:32] and the
[57:35] Tabernacles so we also know that the
[57:38] life of Joseph is written throughout the
[57:40] Book of Revelation in symbol form
[57:44] because everything in Genesis in seed
[57:46] form will be multiplied in
[57:52] Revelation just like in Genesis you have
[57:54] Joseph revealing himself to his 11
[57:57] Brethren so in the Book of
[58:00] Revelation we can see that it was God or
[58:03] Christ who revealed himself to the
[58:07] 144,000 in multiplied form in Genesis
[58:11] you have one woman EO is deceived in
[58:14] Revelation the whole world is deceived
[58:17] is the same thing but in multiplied
[58:20] form so in Genesis you have human flesh
[58:24] revealing the secret of the hearts that
[58:26] woman is Zara but in these last days and
[58:29] many membered body in the last days so
[58:34] Joseph represented
[58:37] Perfection as the prophet said that
[58:39] election in Abraham justification in
[58:42] Isaac Grace in Jacob but then perfection
[58:45] in
[58:46] Joseph so the mystery of the Life of
[58:49] Christ was revealed in the life of
[58:51] Joseph so then what was written of the
[58:54] life of Joseph in Genesis in story form
[58:57] must also be found written in the Book
[58:59] of Revelation in Syle form
[59:04] amen so that why God Is So
[59:07] Grace because what happened then will
[59:10] happen now what he's doing then is still
[59:14] doing today because he's the same
[59:17] yesterday today and forever if we can
[59:19] see the pattern we can see or appreciate
[59:22] God Amen that God is in working
[59:26] so the Feast of the Passover which is
[59:28] the first of the Jewish feast is
[59:31] represented by Joseph in prison where
[59:34] one man lives and the other man dies
[59:36] this was Christ on the cross where one
[59:38] Thief was saved and one the other was
[59:41] lost and then the Feast of the unle
[59:44] bread was where Christ's body was broken
[59:47] for us those two Feast the Passover the
[59:50] and living bread represent Christ's
[59:52] death then Joseph came out of prison and
[59:55] went to to the right hand of pero
[59:57] representing the resurrection of Christ
[1:00:01] which is the Feast of the first fruit
[1:00:02] taking place after Christ came out of
[1:00:06] the
[1:00:07] earth then the Feast of the first fruit
[1:00:09] is the Feast of Pentecost representing
[1:00:12] the seven Church ages amen the Gentile
[1:00:15] church and then after Joseph brother
[1:00:19] were gathered together because of the
[1:00:21] crisis and depressions that drove them
[1:00:23] out of their Homeland because the feast
[1:00:25] that followed the Peace of the Pentecost
[1:00:27] is the Feast of the trumpets the calling
[1:00:30] out of the Israelites
[1:00:35] amen and the Feast of the trumpets to
[1:00:38] gather the Jew back together for the
[1:00:39] Feast of atonement which is Joseph
[1:00:41] revealing himself to his brother which
[1:00:43] is these days Jesus making himself known
[1:00:46] to the 144 Jew by the true prophets of
[1:00:49] Revelation 11 of Moses and Elijah what
[1:00:53] message we receive in this last day will
[1:00:55] be preached to them again by this two
[1:00:58] prophets of Revelation 11
[1:01:01] 46 days 1,26 day which is three and a
[1:01:06] half years there remaining three and a
[1:01:08] half years after the seven or the seven
[1:01:10] of Daniel was cut off 3 and 1/2 years
[1:01:13] Jesus Christ fulfilled and three and 1/2
[1:01:15] years will be fulfilled by this two
[1:01:17] prophet of Revelation
[1:01:19] 11
[1:01:23] amen and notice that Joseph revealing
[1:01:26] himself to them not by them noticing his
[1:01:28] physical appearance but he reveal
[1:01:29] himself to them by his word I am
[1:01:32] Joseph it will be the spoken word again
[1:01:36] and Joseph brother were gathered
[1:01:38] together during a time of economic
[1:01:39] depression in this day it was the Second
[1:01:41] World wall that run them back to their
[1:01:44] Homeland a time of economic
[1:01:47] depression which is under the second woo
[1:01:50] and the sixth
[1:01:52] trumpet just bear with me we will be
[1:01:55] going there
[1:01:58] amen I'm just showing you the example of
[1:02:00] Joseph's life
[1:02:02] expressed naturally in all the Bible
[1:02:06] amen amen then the message that God in
[1:02:09] this hour has unlocked these things to
[1:02:11] us so we can see that we can get Joseph
[1:02:15] life
[1:02:16] story from the beginning of his life up
[1:02:20] to the end it speaks we have so many
[1:02:23] nuggets and lesson that we can get from
[1:02:26] Joseph life story and we can preach on
[1:02:30] and on and on and on but what attracts
[1:02:32] me is this if you can turn with me in in
[1:02:36] Genesis
[1:02:42] chapter Genesis
[1:02:46] 45 verse
[1:02:50] 5-7 after Joseph Journeys he come to
[1:02:54] realizations
[1:02:57] of what happened to his life that we can
[1:02:59] say that all things works together for
[1:03:01] good to them that love the Lord to those
[1:03:04] who are called according to his purpose
[1:03:06] and Joseph after his troubles and trials
[1:03:08] in his life he come to a
[1:03:10] realization that now he is meeting with
[1:03:13] his
[1:03:14] Brethren verse 45 verse 5 now therefore
[1:03:18] be not grieved so he's speaking about
[1:03:21] his brother not angry with yourself that
[1:03:24] he sold me he for God did send me before
[1:03:28] you to preserve
[1:03:29] life God sent
[1:03:32] me to preserve life amen for this two
[1:03:36] years had the Ping been in the land and
[1:03:38] yet there are five years in which there
[1:03:40] shall neither be earring nor Harvest and
[1:03:43] God sent me before you to preserve you a
[1:03:46] prosperity in the earth and to save your
[1:03:49] lives by a great
[1:03:53] Deliverance amen amen in verse 7 again
[1:03:56] and God sent me before
[1:04:00] you he must have this personal
[1:04:02] experience with God that he realized
[1:04:05] that what happened to his life it was
[1:04:08] all about God's doing amen right and God
[1:04:12] sent me before you to preserve you a
[1:04:15] posterity in the earth and to save your
[1:04:18] lives by a great
[1:04:22] Deliverance so posterity is your
[1:04:26] descendant your future
[1:04:29] Offspring God sent me before you to
[1:04:33] preserve your posterity to preserve your
[1:04:37] descendant Amen to preserve your
[1:04:39] Offspring
[1:04:41] right in other words there would have
[1:04:43] been no Jewish Nation as we know it if
[1:04:46] God had sent Joseph to Egypt so God was
[1:04:50] not only saving the lives of the son of
[1:04:53] Jacob but if we notice he was also was
[1:04:55] saving all the millions of descendant of
[1:04:58] the 12 tribes of Israel that would come
[1:05:01] from this 12 patriarch because he said
[1:05:04] God sent me to preserve your posterity
[1:05:09] Hallelujah so if we read the story of
[1:05:12] Joseph it was not really
[1:05:15] God who throwed him in the
[1:05:19] ditch it was his
[1:05:23] brother but he said that it was God who
[1:05:25] said me but if we read in the chapter 33
[1:05:29] it was his brother who hated him who was
[1:05:32] jealous with him that throw him in the
[1:05:39] ditch but what Joseph come to realize as
[1:05:42] the story goes is that it wasn't
[1:05:44] actually his brother yes it was God and
[1:05:48] this is what we must come to realize and
[1:05:52] that Understanding God's way we need to
[1:05:55] to realize that God is on the
[1:05:59] moveen all this was done by God for the
[1:06:02] purpose of saving life God is the author
[1:06:05] of life and the savior of life amen so
[1:06:08] we notice two things that are going on
[1:06:10] on here on this chapter 45 there was a
[1:06:13] worldwide
[1:06:16] famine that is to last for years ahead
[1:06:19] where in millions will go hungry and
[1:06:21] lose their businesses houses and lands
[1:06:24] and yet during this time we see an
[1:06:27] elected people being
[1:06:30] preserved without the need of
[1:06:34] money during the Ping time God knows
[1:06:37] what he's doing that's right he is
[1:06:39] preserving the lives of those elected
[1:06:41] people and we are now in the same
[1:06:44] situation praise the
[1:06:48] Lord so let's go back to or turn back in
[1:06:53] Genesis 42 verse 1-4
[1:07:00] now when Jacob the father saw that there
[1:07:03] was corn in
[1:07:06] Egypt Jacob said unto his son why do you
[1:07:09] look one upon another and he said behold
[1:07:11] I heard that there's corn in
[1:07:14] Egypt get you down dether and buy for us
[1:07:17] from then that we may leave and not
[1:07:20] die Jacob heard because Faith cometh by
[1:07:24] hearing and hearing the word the Lord
[1:07:26] amen Jacob heard that there was
[1:07:28] blessings going on there was a God Who
[1:07:30] provided for all his
[1:07:32] people amen you need to go don't wait
[1:07:36] you need to go if you think that God is
[1:07:38] calling you if you think that God is
[1:07:40] blessing you God is knocking your heart
[1:07:43] go don't
[1:07:47] wait because it is a blessing if you
[1:07:49] feel that God is something Knocking at
[1:07:52] Your Heart amen as the script no one can
[1:07:56] come to me except the father draws him
[1:07:58] and all the father draws him I will no
[1:08:01] wayse cast them out if God is knocking
[1:08:03] you it's yours a blessing amen amen amen
[1:08:09] good notice that this setting that this
[1:08:12] was about buying food during a time of
[1:08:14] economic depression because the whole
[1:08:16] world was planted into depression
[1:08:19] because of famine so that their lives
[1:08:22] depended on
[1:08:24] this but but we see as the story goes
[1:08:26] along we find that they did actually
[1:08:28] need their money because God had
[1:08:30] prepared for this event in Joseph was
[1:08:33] the one who would became their provider
[1:08:36] for the Bride of this end time because
[1:08:38] Joseph which is type of Christ is on the
[1:08:41] scene again in this age because soon
[1:08:44] there will come an economic Squeeze In
[1:08:46] Our Generation look at what is happening
[1:08:50] in our
[1:08:52] days Trump will impose tari from the
[1:08:56] goods from Canada from Mexico from China
[1:09:01] and
[1:09:02] all and in retaliation they do the
[1:09:06] same so what will happen in our
[1:09:10] County that's why the issues now is
[1:09:12] about the egg the egg is too expensive
[1:09:15] now
[1:09:17] today during Co time it was toilet
[1:09:20] paper Brown out of toilet paper economic
[1:09:24] depression
[1:09:25] econom be
[1:09:27] squeezing but God provide everything
[1:09:29] amen amen thank you Lord he said Joseph
[1:09:33] ahead to be Hallelujah their provider
[1:09:35] during that
[1:09:36] time as Joseph's 10 Breen went down to
[1:09:40] buy corn in Egypt but Benjamin Joseph
[1:09:43] brother Jacob sent not his brother for
[1:09:45] he said Les perion Mischief before him
[1:09:48] and when we know that Benjamin was the
[1:09:50] younger brother of Joseph which is type
[1:09:52] of the 144,000 Jew so in Genesis 45
[1:09:56] again and Joseph said unto his Breen
[1:09:58] come near me I pray you and they came
[1:10:01] near and he said I am Joseph your
[1:10:03] brother whom ye sold into
[1:10:11] Egypt how do you think you feel when you
[1:10:15] commit something about that
[1:10:17] brother and he told you in your very
[1:10:20] face you sold me
[1:10:25] right he didn't called
[1:10:28] them because as a Christian we can know
[1:10:31] to we know how to handle
[1:10:34] ourselves but he told them with love
[1:10:40] amen come near me I pray you and he said
[1:10:43] I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold in
[1:10:47] Egypt if ye did sold him what an
[1:10:50] embarrassing moment during that
[1:10:53] time maybe you will feel you will hide
[1:10:55] and go home and never
[1:10:57] mind but not
[1:11:00] Joseph he really understood it was the
[1:11:03] spirit of God in Joseph in verse 5 now
[1:11:06] therefore be not
[1:11:08] gri he knows what they feel he know what
[1:11:11] he
[1:11:13] feels about them that's
[1:11:17] why he didn't wait for them to answer
[1:11:21] back because to let them know that they
[1:11:24] sold him is too much to handle
[1:11:27] right so that's why he was the one who
[1:11:30] pacified the feeling and now therefore
[1:11:33] be not gri nor angry with yourself that
[1:11:37] he sold me hither for God did sent me
[1:11:42] before you to preserve
[1:11:44] life Hallelujah and for this two years
[1:11:47] that P been in the land and yet there
[1:11:49] are 5 years in which there shall neither
[1:11:51] be nearing nor Harvest and God sent s me
[1:11:55] before you to preserve life to a
[1:11:58] posterity in the earth and to save your
[1:12:01] lives by a great Deliverance all things
[1:12:04] works together for good to them that
[1:12:06] love the Lord thank you Lord Joseph
[1:12:08] could not be sitting on the
[1:12:11] throne without them throwing him in the
[1:12:18] ditch God works in a mysterious way and
[1:12:21] his ways and his thought is above our
[1:12:23] ways that's right so we need to
[1:12:25] understand understand his ways so that's
[1:12:28] why we can enjoy what is happening or
[1:12:31] coming our ways because this is not
[1:12:34] proving time this is manifestation time
[1:12:38] whatever comes our way is not to put us
[1:12:41] down but to reveal the faith that God
[1:12:43] put in our heart to be displayed thank
[1:12:45] you Lord that's why Joseph don't be
[1:12:52] grieve that you sold me but God did sent
[1:12:57] me hallelujah what a
[1:13:00] Revelations
[1:13:03] so Joseph's brother hating and throwing
[1:13:05] him in a pit and selling him as a slave
[1:13:08] and sending him Egypt to be sold and
[1:13:10] actually a part of the plan of God's
[1:13:13] Great Deliverance for
[1:13:15] them so if God deals like that for that
[1:13:19] family and he is the same yesterday
[1:13:21] today and forever then we know that is
[1:13:23] how is dealing with with us even with
[1:13:26] everything seems wrong and mess up with
[1:13:29] our lives also but we must also come to
[1:13:33] realize like Joseph that is not all
[1:13:35] wrong of life at all but it is God
[1:13:38] incontrollable Amen and we can find this
[1:13:41] in every Almost Family
[1:13:47] happening Brothers against
[1:13:50] Brothers as we a Christian we try our
[1:13:53] best to live a Christian Life we try our
[1:13:55] best to do good to
[1:13:58] others but sometimes you wonder why that
[1:14:02] even though you leave a good example you
[1:14:06] do a right thing you do a right
[1:14:08] decision
[1:14:10] somebody's not really happy about
[1:14:13] that and they try to put you down and
[1:14:16] try to uh uh uh make stories to put your
[1:14:21] character down and sometimes we wonder
[1:14:23] why
[1:14:26] yes remember that Spirit Never Dies
[1:14:30] that's right our flesh will die by the
[1:14:33] spirit that motivate will not
[1:14:35] die what motivate his
[1:14:39] brother to throw Joseph it was by
[1:14:43] jealousy right remember that in your
[1:14:47] life you try to do good you try your
[1:14:49] very best to be good but somebody's
[1:14:51] always putting you down even in your
[1:14:53] social media
[1:14:59] they're trying to put you
[1:15:01] down and sometimes it hurts you so
[1:15:05] much but remember if it happened then
[1:15:09] it's still happening now amen that's
[1:15:11] right because Spirit Never
[1:15:13] Dies if there are spirit that do
[1:15:17] hatred that throw jealousy there is
[1:15:20] always a spirit that says God sent me to
[1:15:23] preserve life Hallelujah so if you are
[1:15:27] that Joseph just live the
[1:15:29] life and enjoy that whatever happens in
[1:15:33] your surrounding in your life that you
[1:15:35] know that you're are serving Christ
[1:15:37] right you're serving your people right
[1:15:38] just stay in line
[1:15:41] amen they are jealous ascept because
[1:15:45] what Joseph have they don't have that's
[1:15:48] right that's why they try to kill
[1:15:51] him that's the only reason why people
[1:15:53] are go against you when you do something
[1:15:55] good and people go against
[1:15:58] you don't be upset just remember what
[1:16:02] you have they cannot
[1:16:04] have what you have is Christ in you so
[1:16:08] that's why they got jealous
[1:16:11] sometimes
[1:16:13] true so in order to avoid this
[1:16:16] huraches avoid your social
[1:16:21] media avoid posting your life
[1:16:26] in social media and wait for somebody to
[1:16:30] likes how many likes I have how many oh
[1:16:32] this this this is my friend but he don't
[1:16:35] put likes I will erase him delete
[1:16:41] him you cannot you have good intentions
[1:16:44] maybe to
[1:16:46] share but not everybody is
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:52] Happy 99% people will get
[1:16:56] jealous because they cannot help
[1:16:59] it as long as we are in the place the
[1:17:01] nature of the place is jealousy
[1:17:04] backbiters high-headed minded lovers of
[1:17:07] pressures more
[1:17:11] Pride so in order to help even the
[1:17:14] fellow Christian in even in order to
[1:17:17] help them just avoid
[1:17:21] posting how you Poe how you smile
[1:17:25] wherever you just post the word of God
[1:17:29] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:17:32] Jesus Christ that's right and you shall
[1:17:34] receive the gift of the Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost in everything give
[1:17:40] thanks I think that's the best thing
[1:17:43] that you can post in your social media
[1:17:44] the word of God that's right Hallelujah
[1:17:47] but not everybody can post that but you
[1:17:49] are now encouraged to post those
[1:17:53] words amen amen
[1:17:57] amen are you happy or not
[1:18:01] amen amen so we'll continue
[1:18:05] on verse eight so now it was not you
[1:18:07] that sent me hi but God and he had made
[1:18:11] me a father to pharaoh and the Lord of
[1:18:14] all his house and a ruler throughout all
[1:18:17] the land of
[1:18:18] Egypt so we can if we follow the life
[1:18:22] story of Joseph when he gets to the end
[1:18:24] of story of the life of Joseph from the
[1:18:26] prison house to the right hand of pharoh
[1:18:29] he begins to look back on the event of
[1:18:32] his life and
[1:18:34] realize that all the bad happening of
[1:18:36] his life were not bad things at all
[1:18:39] that's
[1:18:39] right in fact they were all working
[1:18:42] together for his good and they were all
[1:18:45] designed by God for the purpose of
[1:18:47] saving lives praise the Lord whatever
[1:18:50] we've been through now we need to look
[1:18:53] back and not be discouraged but thanking
[1:18:56] God that all those years that I've been
[1:18:59] through until now I'm serving God it was
[1:19:02] his grace amen it was not your strength
[1:19:06] it was not your ability it was not
[1:19:09] something that you do that you continue
[1:19:12] serving God when you look back it was
[1:19:15] God's promise I will be with you even in
[1:19:18] you until the end of the world Amen
[1:19:20] thank you Lord just like job when he
[1:19:22] suffered so much in his trial and
[1:19:26] testing it can stop him from worshiping
[1:19:29] God because his trial and testing has
[1:19:31] nothing to do with God that he serving
[1:19:33] that's right so in the midst of his
[1:19:35] trial and his testing he's still serving
[1:19:37] God the Lord give it and the Lord take
[1:19:41] it away and blessed be the name of the
[1:19:44] Lord that's right hallelujah
[1:19:48] amen and if we could only realize and
[1:19:51] understand that ourselves all the things
[1:19:53] that happen to us that we think are so
[1:19:55] bad but actually the purpose of God to
[1:19:57] bring about the saving of life for us
[1:19:59] and offering Offspring also because God
[1:20:02] can't act or deal any different with
[1:20:04] your life than he did with Joseph
[1:20:06] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:20:09] and
[1:20:11] forever amen hallelujah so the life of
[1:20:15] Joseph portray The Life of Christ
[1:20:19] amen
[1:20:22] hallelujah so we as the sons of God are
[1:20:25] also portraying The Life of Christ in
[1:20:29] our different way in the message
[1:20:30] identification of all Christ in all ages
[1:20:35] identification of Christ in all
[1:20:38] ages Christ is the anointed word in all
[1:20:41] the ages amen Joseph a perfect example
[1:20:45] that was Christ in Joseph it was the
[1:20:49] word of God that motivated and inspired
[1:20:51] Joseph why you notice he was love of his
[1:20:54] father despised of his brothers because
[1:20:56] he was a
[1:20:57] seir they hated him without a
[1:21:01] cause the Same
[1:21:04] Spirit they hated Joseph they hated
[1:21:07] Moses so Doan and K arise and they asked
[1:21:11] question about Moses is he the only
[1:21:13] prophet in the land right right when
[1:21:16] Jesus come they hated him without a
[1:21:18] cause that's right where did this man
[1:21:20] come he didn't come from our
[1:21:23] denomination they hated brother bham
[1:21:25] even though
[1:21:27] he performed a lot of Miracles and in
[1:21:30] the Crusade likewise in our day the same
[1:21:33] thing amen they hate us because Christ
[1:21:36] in US is the one that they hate it's not
[1:21:39] our personal that they hate they have
[1:21:41] nothing to hate about us we are all
[1:21:44] different but it was Christ in
[1:21:46] us hallelujah that motivate them to hate
[1:21:50] us amen the man could help what he was
[1:21:55] he was an another brother hated him and
[1:21:57] a very good type of all ages because
[1:22:00] Spirit Never Dies amen always when a
[1:22:03] sear comes on the scene the rest of them
[1:22:05] hate him for the same cause as they did
[1:22:08] Joseph help it he could interpret their
[1:22:10] dreams never was he wrong he for told
[1:22:13] things never was he wrong and his
[1:22:15] brother hated him without a cause it did
[1:22:17] happen to our Lord Jesus Christ it also
[1:22:21] happened to brother Branham
[1:22:23] right so if happen to them it will
[1:22:26] happen to us
[1:22:28] too and notice his life portray Christ
[1:22:31] to us exactly even sold almost for 30
[1:22:34] pieces of silver taken up out of the
[1:22:38] ditch and set at the right hand of per
[1:22:41] the ruler of the world at that day and
[1:22:44] every time he left the place they
[1:22:46] sounded trumpet and said every KN bow
[1:22:49] because Joseph is coming a perfect type
[1:22:52] of Christ in the billenium and when the
[1:22:54] the trumpet sound he come forth and
[1:22:56] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[1:22:58] shall confess to him and notice in
[1:23:01] prison he was a
[1:23:04] prophet so if you born gifts and
[1:23:07] callings are without repentance
[1:23:10] amen you don't cultivate it you don't
[1:23:13] learn it you are born with a certain
[1:23:15] gift in your life amen gifts and
[1:23:18] callings are without repentance whatever
[1:23:21] happened to Joseph he will be put in
[1:23:24] prison thr into the dits but he remains
[1:23:26] to be a
[1:23:31] prophet that's when he was sold and put
[1:23:33] into prison on account of P Park's wife
[1:23:36] then we find that in the The Butcher and
[1:23:37] the baker they both had dreamed and he
[1:23:40] the dream and one was lost and one was
[1:23:43] saved so did Jesus on the cross exactly
[1:23:45] one was lost and was was saved and when
[1:23:48] he was in prison t to the Cross just a
[1:23:50] perfect example amen and Joseph was the
[1:23:53] son of
[1:23:55] Prosperity
[1:23:56] whatever no matter where he went it
[1:23:59] always prosper and when the time would
[1:24:01] come Hallelujah the prosperity to be
[1:24:04] with Christ will come soon amen amen
[1:24:07] because our Joseph is Christ who has
[1:24:10] made himself known to us by the revealed
[1:24:13] word of the hour so notice the parallel
[1:24:17] of what applies to the elected Jew also
[1:24:20] applies to the elected gentle
[1:24:23] bright because how he deal with the Jew
[1:24:25] is how also he deals with the Gentile
[1:24:28] bride bride in parel what was happening
[1:24:31] in noi was also happening in Ruth in
[1:24:36] paral what the seven seal is to the
[1:24:39] bride the seven trumpet is to the Jew
[1:24:42] yes in both cases it is Christ revealing
[1:24:46] himself to his elect amen he deal with
[1:24:50] Israel as a nation he deal with the
[1:24:52] Gentile as an individual but is all the
[1:24:55] same and when we study the life of
[1:24:58] Joseph we know that everything happens
[1:25:00] to him in experience is for the purpose
[1:25:02] of saving lives that's why God called us
[1:25:05] with a
[1:25:06] purpose and we need to find a purpose in
[1:25:08] our lives
[1:25:10] amen and so that is revealing the nature
[1:25:13] of God how he deals with us in the
[1:25:15] experience of Our Lives knowing and
[1:25:20] understanding God's
[1:25:21] way so when it seems like everything
[1:25:24] goes the opposite to how you think it
[1:25:26] should go then you can be
[1:25:28] certain that God is in your life because
[1:25:33] that is the
[1:25:36] way it has always been in the scripture
[1:25:39] concerning the elect of
[1:25:42] God God never changed that's right so
[1:25:46] whatever happen in your life look back
[1:25:49] in the scripture and it will give you
[1:25:51] consolations and comfort because how God
[1:25:54] delivered
[1:25:55] them is also how God will Deliver Us
[1:25:59] amen nothing changed that's why we have
[1:26:02] confidence to believe in his word
[1:26:03] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:26:05] and
[1:26:06] forever Hallelujah so let's look at some
[1:26:09] of the event in Joseph's
[1:26:12] life in uh verse
[1:26:18] 37 this is the the the starting chapter
[1:26:23] of Joseph's life you know there are how
[1:26:25] many uh chapter about Joseph I think
[1:26:28] it's uh chapter 37 to chapter 50 but
[1:26:32] here in chapter 37 is starting and Jacob
[1:26:36] dwelt in the land wherein his father was
[1:26:39] Stranger In the Land of
[1:26:41] Canaan and these are the generations of
[1:26:44] Jacob Joseph being 17 years old so
[1:26:47] that's why sometimes the word of God is
[1:26:50] so specific in names in numbers
[1:26:55] because chapter or number 17 speaks
[1:26:58] about a prophet remember that our
[1:27:01] scripture is being fulfilled is Luke
[1:27:05] 173 Revelation 10 and 7 which is 17 and
[1:27:11] remember when brother Braham baptized
[1:27:13] the 17th person in High River then The
[1:27:16] Voice come as J bapst
[1:27:19] forrun first coming your ministry or
[1:27:22] your message will forrun the same second
[1:27:24] coming of Christ number 17 is the number
[1:27:26] of
[1:27:29] prophet 17 Jo was feeding the pla with
[1:27:32] his Brethren and lad was with the sons
[1:27:35] of baa with the son of Sila his father's
[1:27:37] wife and Joseph and brought unto his
[1:27:39] father their evil report now Joseph or
[1:27:43] Israel loved Joseph more than all his
[1:27:46] children because he was the son of his
[1:27:48] old age and he made him a coat of many
[1:27:51] colors and when his Brethren saw that
[1:27:53] their father Lov him more than all his
[1:27:55] Brethren they hated him and could not
[1:27:58] speak peaceably unto
[1:28:01] him everything that Joseph is doing they
[1:28:06] give meaning unto
[1:28:08] it they bring malice unto what Joseph is
[1:28:11] doing amen remember that
[1:28:14] Joseph was his son is his old
[1:28:18] age so if you are the
[1:28:21] youngest among your siblings there's
[1:28:24] there is always a
[1:28:27] favoritism your dad always loved the
[1:28:31] youngest and some of the sibling had the
[1:28:35] reason to be
[1:28:37] jealous because whatever the youngest
[1:28:40] asked automatically the dad will give
[1:28:43] the father give but when some of the
[1:28:47] brothers ask okay forget
[1:28:50] it maybe next
[1:28:53] time we will give something to the
[1:28:55] youngest because he was young and God
[1:28:58] gave him and Jacob gave him a coat of
[1:29:02] many
[1:29:05] colors and when a father gave a son a
[1:29:09] many colors it speaks of
[1:29:13] prestige speaks of Loy
[1:29:16] royalty I we know the significant of the
[1:29:19] seven colors it speaks about the stature
[1:29:21] of a perfect man it speaks about the
[1:29:23] revelation of seven Church ages it
[1:29:25] speaks about the Seven Seals speaks
[1:29:27] about the seven bals seven trumpets so
[1:29:30] the inspiration was in Joseph so all
[1:29:33] these denominations brothers and sisters
[1:29:36] can get jealous because they don't have
[1:29:37] the revelation of seven search ages they
[1:29:40] don't have revelation of the seven seal
[1:29:41] they don't have the revelation of vials
[1:29:43] of the trumpet and all the feast they
[1:29:46] don't know nothing about it so that's
[1:29:49] why they got jealous and jealous and
[1:29:50] jealous and DED to put it down all that
[1:29:52] proper is all that Prophet is false
[1:29:55] prophet remember when you say false
[1:29:57] prophet you need to check yourself amen
[1:30:01] because the scripture will not say false
[1:30:03] prophet beware of false prophet if there
[1:30:05] is no genuine that's right they always
[1:30:09] capitalize when you share about the
[1:30:11] prophet they always capitalize in
[1:30:12] Matthew chapter 24 beware of false
[1:30:18] prophet how about the true Prophet amen
[1:30:22] so instead of saying you need to find
[1:30:25] the real
[1:30:27] Prophet because Matthew 24 say beware of
[1:30:30] false prophet we need to find the real
[1:30:32] prophet in the land sir so denominations
[1:30:36] will quote just scriptures pertaining to
[1:30:39] themselves and put a period in it and
[1:30:42] make denomination out of it that's why
[1:30:45] in the time of reformers when God showed
[1:30:48] Luther the
[1:30:50] justification he put a period in it I
[1:30:53] didn't want it it dies and God raised
[1:30:56] another and wly saw the second stage of
[1:30:59] Grace and he said and put a period in it
[1:31:02] Pentecostal put a per in it right but
[1:31:05] praise God hallelujah all those give but
[1:31:08] now we are receiving The Giver of the
[1:31:10] gift in our day Hallelujah and there is
[1:31:13] no more period it is all Kama because
[1:31:17] God is the SP inspiring himself in
[1:31:19] continuity God is revealing himself his
[1:31:22] thought and the prophet said are
[1:31:24] are the thought of God
[1:31:26] Eternal
[1:31:28] right if you can believe that God
[1:31:30] Eternal then you will see many things
[1:31:34] God is unlimited that's infinite and his
[1:31:37] in and his power never change but he
[1:31:40] keep on unfolding and unfolding and
[1:31:42] unfolding Hallelujah that's why his
[1:31:44] brother so hated
[1:31:48] him true that's why when you share the
[1:31:51] seven Church ages people are hat well
[1:31:53] did you get that why did you put the
[1:31:56] lest brother
[1:31:58] Bram well it's not for them it's only
[1:32:01] for the
[1:32:03] bride because how much effort you do to
[1:32:05] share if they are not part of the
[1:32:08] program of God they will just reject
[1:32:11] it because Elijah was sent yes to
[1:32:17] you a special class of people that's
[1:32:21] right and you recognize the calling
[1:32:24] without any hesitation that's why when I
[1:32:27] receive the message of the the first
[1:32:29] time I read about the the serpent seed I
[1:32:31] don't have any question I just Embrace
[1:32:34] and and praise God about that
[1:32:38] amen a lot of issues will go against all
[1:32:41] that's first prophet you cannot find an
[1:32:44] Apple you cannot
[1:32:47] find I don't need to
[1:32:50] argue because I cannot explain it but I
[1:32:54] believe it that's right God don't
[1:32:56] require us to to to to to explain it but
[1:33:00] he requires if you can only believe and
[1:33:03] if you can only believe and you can only
[1:33:05] believe if you part of the program of
[1:33:08] God because if you have no part in the
[1:33:12] economy of God you you will always
[1:33:16] reject the word of God Amen so that's
[1:33:19] why this brother saw that their father
[1:33:21] loved him more than all his Breen they
[1:33:23] hated and could not speak peaceably unto
[1:33:29] him have you met some of that I maybe in
[1:33:33] your classroom in your work that how
[1:33:35] much you think is right they always put
[1:33:38] a malice in it even just a simple
[1:33:43] word and that is so
[1:33:46] toxic in your workplace or maybe in
[1:33:49] school or whatever that every time in
[1:33:52] your heart is so so you become Jolly you
[1:33:57] just want to be what who you are but
[1:34:00] they give malice on it they put you down
[1:34:03] they sing they talk about you to
[1:34:05] somebody
[1:34:08] else this thing is just too small
[1:34:10] compared to our
[1:34:12] head compared to our body but it do a
[1:34:16] damage a lot of
[1:34:21] damage when you say something
[1:34:24] and somebody cuts it then they will add
[1:34:28] something to
[1:34:31] it then when somebody another heard they
[1:34:34] put something in it then somebody heard
[1:34:37] and they put something in it that's why
[1:34:39] New Birth is a personal revelation of
[1:34:41] Jesus Christ it is not a second-handed
[1:34:44] revelation you need to have your
[1:34:46] personal experience with God and don't
[1:34:49] rely to anybody who Shar to you his
[1:34:52] understanding or interpretation of the
[1:34:55] scripture we need to pray and kneel and
[1:34:58] ask God personally for the revelation of
[1:35:00] Jesus Christ because his church is
[1:35:03] founded or founded upon the revelation
[1:35:06] of the rock of Jesus Christ so we notice
[1:35:09] that even though there were bad family
[1:35:11] forces at work against
[1:35:13] Joseph it was God actually in all of
[1:35:16] this because his background hated his b
[1:35:20] was
[1:35:21] necessary remember it was NE necessary
[1:35:25] God is using
[1:35:26] it in order for all the others event
[1:35:29] that follow so that God could bring
[1:35:31] about all the events of his life for the
[1:35:35] purpose of saving them and their
[1:35:38] offspring if this family situation had
[1:35:41] been this way then the rest of the story
[1:35:43] even could never have taken place that's
[1:35:45] right and that's the Paradox of how God
[1:35:48] do
[1:35:49] it it's a family of prayer amen not only
[1:35:53] as our individual family our church
[1:35:56] family or any group of family you can
[1:35:59] always find that kind of
[1:36:01] spirit but remember all things works
[1:36:04] together for good thank you Lord to them
[1:36:06] that love the Lord amen the trial is not
[1:36:09] for them but it's for
[1:36:12] you you just need to recognize it just
[1:36:15] like Joseph God said me before you to
[1:36:18] preserve
[1:36:21] life that's a profound statement
[1:36:24] yes it takes a real revelation of the
[1:36:26] grace of God in our lives that's right
[1:36:29] because in these last days this is the
[1:36:31] most chaotic age that we are living in
[1:36:34] it was prophesied that these Generations
[1:36:37] are all heavym
[1:36:39] minded lovers of
[1:36:42] pressures truce
[1:36:45] Breakers in
[1:36:47] continent
[1:36:49] despises those who are stand for truth
[1:36:52] that's right disres respectful that's
[1:36:54] right to parents to their Pastor to
[1:36:58] their
[1:36:58] church
[1:37:03] right learning and ever learning and
[1:37:06] never come to the knowledge of truth
[1:37:08] right so this is the spirit that we are
[1:37:11] facing now but praise God we have the
[1:37:14] promise one of these days in a twinkling
[1:37:16] in a moment we'll be going
[1:37:19] out Hallelujah
[1:37:24] uh verse
[1:37:28] 39 verse 11 and it came to pass about
[1:37:31] this time that Joseph went into the
[1:37:33] house to do his business and there was
[1:37:35] none of them of the house therein within
[1:37:39] so this is now the stage where in Joseph
[1:37:41] what in
[1:37:43] Pip's
[1:37:45] house so this is the greatest
[1:37:47] Temptations of
[1:37:49] Joseph he was alone with P part's wife
[1:37:54] and it came to pass about this time so
[1:37:56] we need our young people to really be
[1:38:00] careful with all women running after you
[1:38:06] amen because our young people are all
[1:38:09] goodlook well dressed very
[1:38:12] neat and it's no wonder people will
[1:38:15] girls or women will try to run after
[1:38:20] them so that is the greatest weaknesses
[1:38:24] we need to be careful of our
[1:38:27] popularity of women and
[1:38:34] money and it came to pass after this
[1:38:36] time that Joseph went into the house to
[1:38:38] do his business and there was none of
[1:38:41] the men of the house there within and
[1:38:43] she caught him by His
[1:38:46] Garment what if our
[1:38:50] wife is having good time oh Joseph is
[1:38:55] alone it is my time I need to tempt
[1:39:02] Joseph and when she came that she saw
[1:39:04] that he had left His Garment in hand and
[1:39:06] was fled forth so you need to do just
[1:39:09] like Joseph did when women run up to you
[1:39:12] you need to run
[1:39:14] faster get
[1:39:17] out when they approaching you get
[1:39:20] out especially if they're not the
[1:39:22] message beli
[1:39:24] and even Mage
[1:39:30] believer cuz I heard that oh you don't
[1:39:33] need to to marry unbeliever you need to
[1:39:35] marry a Believer that's good but not
[1:39:38] Believers are real
[1:39:39] believers they just become Believers
[1:39:42] because they receive the spoken word and
[1:39:44] they they are
[1:39:46] identified to be a believer but the
[1:39:48] prophet said there are three kinds of
[1:39:50] Believers make believer and unbeliever
[1:39:52] or make believer
[1:39:54] and the real Believers and the real
[1:39:56] Believers don't run after men or men
[1:39:59] running after women they prayed they ask
[1:40:03] God for guidance amen because if you
[1:40:06] marry that is
[1:40:08] your The Binding is from time to
[1:40:12] Eternity right you need to pray you
[1:40:15] don't run because oh there are so
[1:40:18] handsome men oh the beautiful sister no
[1:40:21] you need to pray amen amen amen just
[1:40:25] like
[1:40:28] elaser find my son a wife elaser and he
[1:40:33] prayed after he prayed then it appears
[1:40:36] the wife likewise the same nothing
[1:40:40] changed don't run for anybody because
[1:40:43] he's is beautiful he is macho is a six
[1:40:46] no no no no no sixpack because we don't
[1:40:48] display
[1:40:50] sixpack forgive me
[1:40:54] because if you see in the all the people
[1:40:56] are really busy having sixpack they're
[1:40:59] showing their bodies the nakedness they
[1:41:02] are just fulfilling the spirit within
[1:41:04] the loud they are wet and miserable and
[1:41:07] they are naked and they don't know it
[1:41:10] physically and spiritually they are
[1:41:14] naked right so they need to be clothed
[1:41:17] by the revealed word of the
[1:41:21] hour and she called unto the men of her
[1:41:25] house and spake unto them saying see he
[1:41:27] had brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock
[1:41:29] us and he came in unto me to lie with me
[1:41:32] and quied with a loud voice and it came
[1:41:34] to pass when he heard that I lifted up
[1:41:36] my voice and quied and he left his
[1:41:38] garment with me and fled and got him and
[1:41:41] she laid up His Garment by her until his
[1:41:44] Lord come home so
[1:41:47] beware because whatever they say if they
[1:41:52] if the government or whatsoever The Same
[1:41:54] Spirit they will always take sight with
[1:41:57] the lies amen they don't take sight with
[1:42:00] the truth so that's why we need to be
[1:42:03] careful in our studies amen amen so we
[1:42:07] need as I I said ago we need to
[1:42:10] pray with the young people men you need
[1:42:13] to pray for a wife and or sisters we
[1:42:16] need you need to pray
[1:42:18] for don't worry about
[1:42:21] numbers or about your
[1:42:24] age age really doesn't
[1:42:28] matter it was by God's
[1:42:32] grace amen so don't worry just serve the
[1:42:35] Lord because God will just amen if you
[1:42:38] don't pray and just just i i i i i i i
[1:42:42] metet a
[1:42:46] brother that he don't really maybe he
[1:42:49] don't pray much but he married a
[1:42:51] so-called believer after a month they
[1:42:53] got
[1:42:57] divorced so sometimes you wonder
[1:43:02] why so I'm following following the
[1:43:05] advice of Propet and under no
[1:43:07] circumstance never marry an unbeliever
[1:43:09] but what I'm saying is I don't give this
[1:43:12] a lway that give you permission to marry
[1:43:14] an unbeliever but what I'm saying is you
[1:43:17] need to pray and wait upon the Lord
[1:43:20] don't rush into something don't give
[1:43:22] this braate if you
[1:43:26] don't maybe it's only here in America
[1:43:29] when young people get married so young
[1:43:32] in the Philippines you cannot find or
[1:43:35] seldom find any young people get married
[1:43:39] mostly they are adult age main they
[1:43:41] above 30s or
[1:43:46] something amen so let's go
[1:43:50] back let us not dwell into it I am not a
[1:43:53] pastor
[1:43:55] anyway notice how it was a woman that
[1:43:58] caused Joseph to fall from a position of
[1:44:01] power and Dominion all the way down to
[1:44:03] the prison house this parallel what Eve
[1:44:06] did to the human race when Adam fell
[1:44:08] from position of prosperity and power
[1:44:10] and Dominion under God to a prison House
[1:44:12] of this Fallen World look at all these
[1:44:15] events in Joseph life it all looks like
[1:44:18] a lot of bad
[1:44:19] luck thrown into the Deeds going to P
[1:44:22] the are being accused going to the
[1:44:25] prison house it seems like there is no
[1:44:28] good
[1:44:29] luck right it's all bad
[1:44:34] luck but there was no bad luck about
[1:44:37] this at all this was 100% the Providence
[1:44:41] of God for the purpose of saving lives
[1:44:45] what we often consider our battles and
[1:44:48] defeat in life are actually God's
[1:44:50] Providence of God to bring about a a
[1:44:53] great victory at the end am amen so
[1:44:57] everything all works together for good
[1:45:00] that love the
[1:45:02] Lord amen so last
[1:45:05] scriptures that would
[1:45:08] be saying Victory

[1:45:16] Life if the fellow is not absolutely
[1:45:19] centered on
[1:45:21] Christ the the Christian life seems like
[1:45:25] hold so many

[1:45:38] centered on
[1:45:43] Christ the Christian life seems like

[1:46:09] Christian believing the word of God
[1:46:12] right because whatever happens in our
[1:46:16] life we can still praise
[1:46:19] God but if you are not Christ centered
[1:46:23] or not living rightfully with God it
[1:46:27] seems like hold so many
[1:46:32] disappointments can you say Amen to that
[1:46:34] amen as we
[1:46:36] grow in the grace and in the knowledge
[1:46:39] of the Lord Jesus

[1:46:48] question our life questions our status
[1:46:52] with God but it's a good thing you need
[1:46:56] to seek or check ourselves within the
[1:47:00] word of God why this happen why this
